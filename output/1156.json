With drum' n' bass in the loud room( that's probably the\nbest way to describe it) and James Lavelle, the Scratch Perverts and co in the main room it was a line up to\nrival any other in London that night. Thankfully the\nnight was far from a disappointment. The room styles perfectly\ncomplimented each other as the beats thundered throughout the venue. Indeed the volumes achieved in the loud room are quite phenomenal and not for the sensitive eared. Perfect though forme and my pals, who seem to\nappreciate hurting our ears.\nAnyway Fabric Live was a brilliant night, and I'm sure\nit will remain a brilliant night for however long it\nkeeps its residency. As for the venue, Fabric has arrived as one of the top nightclubs in London. It\nmay not have the name yet,\nbut if nights like these a fast growing reputation is\nassured, and as the word gets around things can only get better.\nJ Patch\nTorture Garden Halloween Event @ Mass\n.. fancy fetish fun and fro licks... Not quite the Skin Two Rubber Ball, but part of the weekend's events and no doubt many of the same people were there last Satu r day in this great venue, which is a converted church. Torture Garden holds large events in random venues at random intervals.\nWhat they all have in common is a fantastic, friendly atmosphere, thumping house and techno on the main floor, outrageous clothing on the people, chill out rooms, and basically one of the best nights\nout around. Feast your eyes on the people, the video visuals, the\nperformance artists, dance and drink. The dungeon boasts a number of pieces of scary looking equipment which people were tied\nto/ on/ in etc. Don't be scared, bizarre as it may seem, they were all\nlaughing and smiling, and perfectly happy to be there! Most( if not\nall) venues have a dungeon room where people can \"play\", but you don't have to and noone will make you. All have changing rooms, so you can come in normal clothes and change, if you are too embarrassed to go out in your rubber dress. Dress codes are\nenforced you will feel awkward if you're not dressed right. How ever, cyber/punk/ futuristic/ role play (i.e. French maid/ nurse/ military/ lingerie) is OK too, and less expensive. The cheapest fetish\nstuff is PVC, you can get a full outfit e.g. a dress for about \u00a3 3 0 ,\nmost places will bargain if you have the nerve to! Get clothes/ equipment for fetish events from\" Paradiso\" in Old Compton Street, \" Honour\" on Lower Marsh near Waterloo Station,\" Murray and Vern\" and\" Black Rose\", both in Stables Market, Camden, and a variety of other places. Tickets for clubs from Paradiso, Zeitgeist or Murray and Vern, usually costing \u00a3 1 0 - 1 5 and most clubs run 1 0 - 4 amor106 am.OK, so maybe you're interested - or just morbidly curious and want to go. Well, you've missed the rub ber ball, but most weekends there are events - look out for Club Rub, Club Flesh, Submission, and various others. It is a fabulous night out, and infinitely amusing to take friends and watch their reactions. As long as you dress right, once you get there\nyou can be as outrageous or as conservative as you want to be - it\ncan be just another club, it is fine to just drink and dance and many people do just that. If you are open minded enough to give it ago, you are guaranteed to have a goodtime, so why not try it?\nIf you like the idea but haven't got the ne r ve, try Full Tilt at Electric\nBallroom in Camden on a Friday night. It's Goth/ Alternative/ Rock, and you don't have to go quite as extreme black will do! fetish female\nRecommended\nClubbing\nMore clubs that may take your fancy...\nThursday J1 th November\nBedrock @ Heaven; \u00a36\nBedrock is a club night going places. Last\nmonth's nights at Heaven and at The\nBeach down in Brighton were out of this\nworld, and this bash won't disappoint. Friday 12th November\nUndertom @ Trenz; \u00a36\nHigh energy uplifting acid tech not ance on the top floor with a more deep and spiritual experience to be had down below. This is a club promoted by two\nex-Imperial people so get there and sup-port. It will be a great night.\nThe Weekly Sessions @ The Annexe; \u00a38\nMilk' n'2 Sugars parties are always worth\na look. This week they've got Mark Farin a over from San Franciso to deliver the\nbeats and cuts.\nSaturday 13rd November\nFabric @ Fabric; \u00a312\nWith a sound system unmatched anywhere in the capital, Fabric boasts a night\nthat others can only dream of putting on\nHeadstart @ Turnmills; \u00a35\nDave Clarke and Andy Weatherall are\nheadlining Head start's two rooms and this should be a good one. To tell the\ntruth Headstart has been lagging a bit\nlately, but this night should be the first of\na resurgence.\nSunday 14th November\nMetalheadz @ Dingwalls; \u00a36\nHave you been yet? If not then why not?\nGet, get down!

    "content": "10 Union Felix \u2022 8 November 1999\nWhether you're hunting for a job or just for treasure, the Royal\nCollege of Science Union can offer a home for your search....\nA Job. Some of you may not recognise this word at first\nsight (hint: you can find it\nin the dictionary under the letter\n'J') but, like it or not, a job is\nprobably what you' re here for.\nThankfully, the Royal College of\nScience can make things that little\nbit easier for you. On Monday15 November at 7 : 3 0 pm is the RCS A Careers Forum an informal get-together where you can discuss your ideas and prospects with\nemployers from out in the real\nworld and, as an added incentive, there will be nibbles and drinks provided. Also that evening is the\nPostGraduate Information Evening. For the rest of you, who don't want a job, there are fun events\nso you can waste your time in a more fulfilling and pleasant way.\nIn particular there is the Treasure\nHunt. If you can' tread amap to save your life then you' d better\nnot sign up. If you think West is\nsomething you wear during winter to keep warm, don't apply. If the\nlast time you tried to get to a9o' lock lecture on Monday morning you got lost and ended up in bed, er, no... in the Serpentine, then this isn't the event for you. If you think a compass is the name of\nthe local pub then, quite frankly,\nyou' ll be crap at the Treasure Hunt. If, however, you' re a normal,( semi) sane student (which,\nseeing as you' restudying here, you should be) then the Treasure\nHunt will be a hugely enjoyable evening, and one where you could stand to win a pairs of Odeon Tickets for each member of the winning team and an RCS scarf each there are even prizes\nfor runners up. Entrants should be\nin teams of four, but if you don't have that many friends then you can join the lost souls list and hope to be united with a kindred spirit. Or something like that.\nSign up sheets are on all R CSU noticeboards or you can email us\nand entrance is just 5 0 p cheap considering the value of the\nprizes.\nAlso coming up is the annual R CSU vs RCS A Darts Match( that\nis the people who are currently at\nCollege vs the people who used to be at College). Of course you don't have to play darts to come along( although it would be nice).\nIt's just an excuse to get together and enjoy a bit of bitter/friendly\nrivalry. Come along and see the\nsort of people you could turn into\nwhen you finally finish here.\nThe Royal College of Science Union's Departmental Societies( or Dep Socs for short) also have events planned. MathS och as a Staff vs Students football match coming up and Bio Chem Soc has a Departmental Welcome, with\ncocktails, and a boat party on Wednesday10 November. All departments have a Dep Soc which is only too keen to take on new members who want to help out and make a difference. PhysS oc in particular needs new recruits, so if there are any budding physicists out there, do get in\ncont a ct.\nThat' s probably it for the next\nfour weeks or so, but you can rest\nassured there will be plenty more coming soon. If you want to get\nnotification of R CSU events then\nthere is the r csu list mailing list,\nwhich will also allow you to keep\nup to date with your Union. There\nis also another list, r csu matters,\nwhich is a discussion forum about the Union sign up and have your\nsay. Subscription details in the\ncontacts box below. Just time for\na quick mention of:\n1\nROAD HE ETH ave you picked up your copy yet? In BroadSheet you' ll find the latest news\naffecting you, all the recent groundbreaking and not so groundbreaking developments in\nscience, reviews, opinion, latest\nevents and information from the\nR CSU and, allegedly, humour all\nfor the incredibly low price of nothing. There' seven an impossibly difficult crossword on the\nback where you can win a \u00a310\nbook token( its so amazingly difficult that there has yet to be a complete solution to any cross-word thankfully incomplete solutions are accepted). This offer is\nnot available in the shops, so\nwhere can you find this fascinating read? At the entrance to your\ndepartment, every other Thursday morning. the next one goes out\nthis Thursday.

There's some masterful mixes from Armin Van Burren and Hybrid onboard and it's a package that pleases\nBasement Jaxx\nJump and Shout\n(XL Recordings)\nBasement Jaxx seem to have a way\nwith beats. Jump and Shout kicks in\nwith a style that almost sounds like a bad DJ crashing rhythms, but like\ntheir other tunes a few more listens\nare enough to win you over. The lyrical delivery comes from an African tribesman, and all in all this is Basement Jaxx classic. Don't be surprised\nif these lads feature highly in Felix'send of year charts.\n\u2022\nBlur\nNo Distance Left to Run\n(Food)\nBlur's newer songs have moved away from singing about a fictional character in the third person and taken on a much more autobiographical mood. No Distance Left\nTo Run is about Damon' s split with\nex-partner Justine Frisch mann. The song is pensive in mood, be uti ful in\ntone; one of the saddest songs I have ever heard. \u2022\nPrimal Scream\nSwastika Eyes\n(Creation)\nHow the Primals do it is\nquite beyond me. Swastika Eyes is a not her absolutely barnstorming track. They've\nhad a little help from the Chemical Brothers,\nbut the way they turn\nout gorgeous tracks one after another is just\nimmense. This is a killer and with this the\nboys are laying down some lucio us foundations for their next\nalbum. Another Level\nBomb Diggy\n(Arista)\nApparently the \"theme\ntune from the T4 programme North Hollywood High\" which the\ncover mounted sticker\nhelpfully informs us can be seen Sundays on Channel4. The boyband with R'n' B per-su as ions provide us\nwith another silky soul\ntune. The title is rhymed\nwith a lot of silly phra ses such as \" goody goody\" and \"chocolate\npu d dy\". This song is\nneither.\nSupergrass\nMary\n(Pariophone)\nSupergrass albums keep getting better and better yet conversely their\nsales get lower and lower. This is\none of their current album's weaker tracks but offers a contrast to previous releases, the breathtaking Moving and the fun but hardly innovative\nPumping On Your Stereo. Mary( where Gaz sings about shocking his\neponymous girlfriend) still retains\nenough quirky brilliance and charm to soon become infectious.\nDina Carroll\nSay You Love Me\n(Mercury)\nSlightly more regular than the\nOlympics, Dina Carroll turns up\nevery three years - but each time\nwith only one decent song. In 1 9 9 0\nit was a cover of It's Too Late with\nQuartz. In 1 9 9 3 it was the won de rful Don't Be A Stranger. 1 9 9 6\nbrought her a No.3 single with\nEscaping. And this year it was that\nsong out a couple of months ago and not this one. Dillinger\nCocaine In My Brain\n(Mercury)\nSome relaxed rapping skips over this rag ga tune, filled to the brim\nwith the sort of funky\nbeats usually heard on Sly Stone records. In\nfact, the original version of this song was\naround in 1 9 7 6 . The\nchorus goes:\" A knife, a fork, a bottle and a cork - that's the way we\nspell New York.\" Well, it\nis if you've got cocaine in your brain.\n...Singles reviews\nby Ed, Ben and\nJames...\n\n"

There willy\nof course, be other candidates, but sadly noone has a clue( or\nindeed a care) who they are. Anyhow, given that someone as unpopular as Alan Clark managed to secure a majority of\n1 0 0 0 0 on a daywhen Labour was storming to massive major i ties nationwide, the chances of \"that nice Mr Portal oo\"( as Neil Kinnock once termed him) screwing this one up are ridiculously small. Consequently, you' re all being offered a chance to see democracy in\naction a saman who once apologised for being half Spanish and is widely regarded as one of the most hypocritical and homophobic public figures around( strange really) is returned as\nyour representative to the government. As Tony the Tiger would say, Gr rrr re at. SO MUCH TO SAY, SO FEW WORDS TO SAY IT\nRight, now; I 've got the ob liga to ry rant out of the way I 'll be get ting back to more important issues. Firstly, thanks to Anonymous Chris for filling in forme on the editorial front last week I'm afraid I was otherwise indisposed. This week, however, I really can't decide what to write\nabout, I could rant at length about politics or the forthcoming elections( go Kengo), but I don't think you' dbe interested. I could tell you about this amazing girl i know, but I don't think that\nwould be wise. I could even espouse on a variety of topics surrounding the world of publishing and news dissemination, but I suspect you' d fall asleep at\nthe vital moment in your lecture. Consequently, I'm going to abandon all these subjects and instead I'm going to talk about job hunting. It never ceases to disappoint me when I see what typical Imperial graduates choose to do with the rest of their lives. Backed with degrees from one of the best institutions in.the world, does your average IC student\ndecide to put their talents to good use, developing techniques, technology or theories for the betterment of mankind? Or do they head straight for the highest starting salary and com mit the rest of their lives to the, ahem, exciting world of consultancy/ accountancy/ management? Now, as I 've said before Ido have a tendency to be a little\nidealistic, but nonetheless there\nare days when I almost think that\nthe College should start to timetable mandatory lectures in\nmorality into every course. May beI'm wrong. Maybe Management Consultancy really\nis about helping to make the\nbetter place after all. Maybe it's unfair to expect the brightest\npeople in the world to take a larger share in shaping the future of the planet. May beI'm just scared by the concept of committing to a job and then\nallowing that to map out the next\nforty years of my life. What do you think?::;;:.\nA BIG THANKYOU Earlier today1 suddenly realised that I have n't thanked the team behind felix nearly enough for their assistance so far this year.\nConsequently, I'd like to finish\noff by saying a big thankyou to everyone on the editorial team, and in particular to James and Gareth.

He started in\nthe mid-sixties with Pop Art (Ping Pong, Stiff\nUpper Lip) before becoming a leading force in\nthe Arte Povera movement, producing a few forgivable duds (Scala, Tavelle) along the way. In\nthe late 6 0 s he renounced all this and started\nafresh with a pared-down and more sophisticated conceptual style.\nHis interest in world affairs and extensive travels\nprompted him to commission a series of giant\ntapestries depicting the world map( Mappa),\nupdated every so often for political changes until\nhis premature death in 1 9 9 4 . In another vast\ntapestry, Tutte (Everything), he presents a startling\nchaotic weave of people and objects, reflecting\nhis other long-term interest in order and chaos.\nBy employing anonymous volunteers to do the\npainting, sculpting or tapestry weaving, he man aged to subvert the traditional role of the artist as\nsole author of her or his work. But is he also subverting our interpretation? After all, many of the\nworks are gently mocking, even silly (Senza\nnum ero l VI), as if to say 'I mean all this to be a joke.' If it is a joke, it certainly is a good one. Spend Spend Spend, which has been hailed as \" The Best\nNew British Musical in Years\" by some critics, opened at the\nPiccadilly Theatre a couple of weeks ago. As the house-lights fade and the overture starts you feel as though you are in for a treat. The orchestration is a happy medium between pop and jazz, the set is slick and you get the feeling that the producers certainly have Spent, Spent and Spent bucket loads in putting the show on stage.\nThe show is based on the story of Viv Nicholson: the\nwoman who went from rags to riches and then back to rags, by virtue of football pools, going through five hus-bands along the way. In a similar vein to shows such as\nBlood Brothers, it makes for a moving and worthy tale that\nshould really work, especially in a West End musical. We are immediately introduced to the 5 0 - old Viv working in a beauty salon, who then becomes our narrator for the\nevening, taking us through her life from the age of 1 5 . So far, so good, but after about fifteen minutes of act one, when every single sexual innuendo imaginable has been thrashed to death, and you haven't been properly intro-duce d to any character, you start to realise that maybe the\nplot is being lost behind smutty jokes and slack direction.\nThe character is ation is so weak that when Viv looses her second husband in a car accident and comes downstage to\nbelt out the shows best tune, \" Who' s Gonna Love Me Now\", you simply don't care.\nWilliam Burns\nCasting Barbara Dickson in the role of Viv was a choice, and although a blatant attempt at getting bums on seats, and she puts in a good performance. Along with the\nrest of the cast she manages to give the show the pace and life it needs.\nThe chances are that you would enjoy Spend Spend Spend\nshould you part with your precious cash, but with over fifteen other musicals currently running round the corner, I reckon you could do a lot better for your money.\nBen P Higher Than Bab/e was directed and prod u ced by ex-IC engineers; Clive Pagent\nand Tim Sawers, both of who were in\nDram soc. Clive Swift - the husband from \"Keeping\nUp Appearances\" who played Cardinal\nand Matthaus, showed how good actors\nwe see in general crap on TV often are; a superb performance.\nThe plot was a little jerky in its jump\nbetween one time and another and throughout the play there is no edge-of-the-seat stuff. It is not an action play but a thoughtful one dealing well with a complex\nsubject.\nThe central issue was the relationship\nbetween society and science. The play\nexplores this by comparing a scientist\nahead of the field (in fifteenth century Italy)\npersecuted for his \" un God like\" ideas of\nmaking a flying machine, with a German( in Nazi Germany) who, dropping his original moral objections, used his genius to\nhelp work on the nuclear bomb. Difficult issues were raised if a little obviously To what extent does society define\nwhat individuals find acceptable in the scientific world? For example Iam against\nGM foods but if people were originally\nagainst flying (a view I now find ridiculous)\ndoes this not show that Iam just unwilling\nto change? This play is a real springboard\nfor philosophical discussion, one for the\ntheatre lovers.\nBen\n\n"

An almost full\nturn-out... Marino\" Never here\" Jana han being the only first team selection who was missing. First\nweapon was sabre: Meaty John, Joe-Joe \"Lightweight\" Wong( mak-ing his IC first team debut) and Mo\" Captain Animal\" Manso ori. Our first time with three sabre urs on the\nsabre team meant that we totally\noutclassed Q MW in what turned\nout to be our best weapon per-form ance with Meaty and Animal winning all their fights and Lightweight only losing one of his 5-4.\nExcellent display by the ICs abreu rs( good skills boys!).\nSABRE:\nIC\nQ MW. Foil next and the team consisting of Dave\"... so, are you single?\" A PK Davidge, Dave \"Jaws\" Hughes and Pete \" the Leprechaun\" Montgomery( also making his debut). A convincingly good fence by A PK who won all his fights (nice one Dave). Jaws won two and the Lepr ech a un was unlucky and having\nonly won one fight. With the match\nnow firmly in the Bints' grasp we could now afford to ease up, sparing Q MW the embarrassment of a crushing defeat.\nFOIL:\nIC\nQ MW Epee was next with Riccardo\" The Italian Stallion\"S a pienza, Jaws and Lightweight. The Stallion\nshowed his prowess with his\nweapons( and also fenced well). He won all three of his fights with ease.\nJaws and Lightweight failed to impress the ladies badminton team by losing all their fights.\nEPEE:\nIC\nQ MW Bints 1 7 - 1 0 Q MW Ladies Fencing (Wannabe Bints)\nUnfortunately Q MW produced a very competitive team this year\nand many of our regular fencers\nwere hit by the dreaded flu bug. The team consisted of \" Legal\" Cap tain Katherine, \" Cockney\" Clare Grove and Ursula \"Titi's\" Marcin i omi who fenced admirably against a team of regular international players (they're bloody good at fencing tool). Many of the fights were close\nproviding excitement for the men'steam, but alas victory was not ours\nfor the taking. Hopefully the ( complete) team will fare better against\nKings next week.\nWannabe Bints 1 - 1 7 Q MW IC II ..\nKings\nRiding the boogie board, on the crest of a wave IC 2 nds sweep all before them. The start did not go as planned. Captain Ch under missed\nan open goal, and Multi-Storey\nscored an own goal. IC0-1 down. The boys were shocked into\naction. Bruce Lee and Jean Claude van Damme destroyed the\nmidfield, steady Eddie took it out wide and Geography Teacher finished off sublime move111 Finally the2 nd team have\ndeveloped into a fluid attacking\nforce. Captain Ch under made up for the earlier cock-up by finishing\nthe attack move of the millennium. Geography Teacher swept in the\nthird goal, and only the referee\nprevented a landslide. Fired up and ready to go, the disco squad should be afraid of revenge. Very\nafraid!\nICSM Mountaineering Society\nA mountaineering venture outside Britain was long overdue\nbut it needed the incentive to\ntake on the organising and sorting\nout that such an undertaking requires\n- Caroline did a first class job.\nOn the 19th of July we wear ready. Got across the Channel without throwing up but made up for it on several roundabouts on the way to\nSwitzerland. Eighteen hours after\nleaving Wilson house, we arrived at\nour destination on the campsite \"Shoenblich\" in Saas Gr und. If action was the key word, there\nwas enough in the next three days to\nsatisfy the biggest of appetites, starting off with a lesson on how to and how not to behave on a glacier. Kevin\n(Batman) our other guide took the\nmore experienced group, while Robin\n(friend of Batman) took the rest. We practiced step cutting, front pointing,\nmoving up and down steep ice, jumping across crevasses, burying ice\naxes and the more awkward job of\nlocating them again. Crevasse rescuing (as we had practiced in the Lake\nDistrict) was put to the test, only this\ntime in a more authentic setting. I still\nremember vividly hearing agonising\ncries for help as Kate rapidly disappeared down an icy crack, out of\nview. Oh, did we laugh!\nWhen the Sun appeared we were\nalready well on our way. \" Climb slow-ly, conserve energy, keep going but\ndon't stop\" was the instruction from\nthe front. Up and up digging our cramp on s into steep ice, put one foot\nin front of the other, watch out for the\ncrevasses next to you, spike in, step\nup - the ridge looks miles upon the\nsky. After an hour we can still measure the distance behind us but looking ahead it still feels as endless as\nbefore. Black dots on the white back-ground show that there are other\npeople around but all that is audible\nare thumps in the snow, occasional\nclick from an ice axe and heavy\nbreathing - plenty of that.\nCrossing frail looking snow bridges, passing sheets of ice with icicles like giant lances dangling from its\nside, scaling steep walls or just follow\na narrow path that is steeply carved\ninto the mountainside laced with the\nice. What amI doing? Reason goes\nout of the window best just accept\nwhatever comes your way - just put\none foot in front of the other. Not even time for photographs.\nFour and a half hours after starting off, both groups reached the top\nat 4 , 0 2 7 metres, the highest point for\nsome of us. Some sweated blood to\nget there, while others wondered what all the fuss was about. Yet all\nagreed upon one thing, an incredibly\ngood feeling standing on top of the\nworld with breathtaking views all\naround us. The Sun is out in full force\nand we are at peace with our sur-rounding s.\" Heaven\"( even the heavy\nbreathing has seized and the only\nsounds area faint breeze and the\nclicking of our cameras).\nAfter a bite to eat, we were ready\nto go down, this time on the south\nside to get to the \"Almagellerhut\", our\nabode for the following night. The route is mixed snow, ice and rock and we learnt to move down (in pairs) efficiently with \" natural\" protection,\nweaving the rope between fixed boulders to keep safety to the forefront\nwithout sacrificing speed. Only on the\nharder sections one climbs while the\nother belays in the conventional way.\nAll too soon we reached the hut and spent the rest of the afternoon participating in local customs (drinking\nschnapps while banging on a cow bell).\nA big breakfast with extra helpings of coffee, bread, butter, cheese\nand the jam put us on the right frame\nof mind for a day of rock climbing.\nOur route possesses everything anyone could wish for. Steep walls, airy\ntraverses, some tricky mantel shelves, a slight overhang and as a bonus a \"Tyrolean traverse\" (a rope set up\nbetween two rocky spikes, some distance apart, where you clip yourself in\nand pull hand over hand across the\nvoid). That completed our three-day\ncourse. Robin and Kevin were on the\nwhole pretty satisfied with our per-form ances, wished us luck and stay\nsafe.\n\n"

Every week when I was in\njunior school the biggest news story would be something to do with Global Warming or Ozone Depletion so much so that every school kid in our generation can still quite happily run off a decent essay on the environmental impact of mankind at a moment's notice. If it wasn't sea level rises (cue\nworrying pictures of large chunks of ice cap falling into\nthe sea) it was\" the hottest summer on record\"( cue\ncomedy pictures of British people turning beetroot red\non Blackpool beach) or the dangers of skin cancer( cue Australian cricket team covered in war paint).\nOne way and another, the impending environmental catastrophe that we would all have to face within our lifetimes seemed assured. And now...? When was the last time you saw Trevor McDonald gravely announcing the results of the\nlatest research into the Greenhouse Effect or a Horizon documentary explaining how Cambridge was going to become a seaside resort within the next twenty years? Quite obviously, the environment is no longer news (you only have to compare the popular i ty of the Green Party ten years ago with recent election\nresults to see that) - but, if the problem was as catastrophic as it seemed, why not? Should we still be\nplanning for the daywhen large tracts of the country\ndisappear into the sea, palm trees become commonplace at Clacton and British farmers become the\nworld's major producer of olives? Or has everything\nchanged? In truth, there are three genuinely plausible explanations for what has happened here:\n1 .)

    "content": "26 Games Felix \u2022 8 November 1999\nShadow Company (PC)\nShadow Company is a real time strategy game and involves lots of cree ping about battlefields in the dark, lots of guns and ammunition and lots of\nkilling. The player is placed in charge of a group of mercenaries and the\ngoal is to complete your objectives and get out, hopefully without dying.\nThere are many aspects of this game which I liked. The missions are completely non-linear and the maps are very well designed. The player is\ncompletely free to choose his own path to accomplish the mission. The emphasis is always on using stealth and guile rather than firepower. In\ngeneral the game is very playable. However the game is marred by a few\nproblems which I'm sure more extensive testing and quality control would have solved. For example, the graphics are one of the best and most frustrating aspects\nof this game. The scenarios take place on very well rendered three dimensional landscapes. The player views through a camera which is free to move anywhere on the map. The battlefields are littered with blown up vehicles and destroyed buildings. However more thought could have\nbeen put into the control of the player's camera. It can be difficult to pos i tion it where you want quickly. Another annoying feature is that the mercenaries cannot be told to automatically pick up the supplies left by the\nenemy. This allied with the difficult camera control makes restocking your\nsoldiers inventory difficult and time consuming. The game appears to have some bugs in it, for example I encountered soldier's graphics being out of sync with their positions and occasional problems with ladders and saving the game. The enemy Al is also poor.\nThe characters have a very limited range of responses and even if you do manage to set the alarm bells ringing in the enemy camp, the characters\nmerely ready their weapons and sit tight.\nShadow Company feels like a game which is nearly finished; the graphics are there and the game is certainly playable. However a little more time\nspent refining what is generally a good game could have turned it into a great one. Graeme In association with\ngames wire. com\nA WHOLE NEW WORLD\nRogue Spear (PC)\nRogue Spear puts you in charge of a crack anti-terrorist team in the near\nfuture. The break up of the Soviet block has led to great instability in much of the world, and to top it off, some nut case has got hold of a nuke and isn't afraid to use it. As the missions progress the plot of the game is\nrevealed until it becomes clear only you can save the western world( The\nrest of the world is already in pretty bad shape in this near future....).\nWhen Rainbow Six was released, it was something of a novelty - a realistic first person shooter, with a unique planning element that made it a cerebral challenge. Since then, the likes of Hidden and Dangerous have\nimproved considerably on R6's graphics and even moved the planning in\nto real time, so it's about time to see what Red Storm can do to get back\non top.\nRogue Spear's graphics are certainly improved, and the level design is\neven more imaginative than its predecessor, with one mission in the war-torn streets of Kosovo being very reminiscent of a recent S peil berg movie.\nIf there was one area that suggested itself for improvement however, it was\nthe planning stage, and unfortunately this remains very similar. It's not possible to change a team's plan during the game, even when things are going diabolically, but maybe that's the point. The majority of missions are\nhostage rescue or bomb def us al style, and I suppose you only get one go at those. However, having to click on scroll and zoom buttons to navigate\naround any reasonably sized map during planning becomes tedious,\nthough it is necessary should you choose not to accept the (often flawed)\ndefault plan. A more intuitive map that could be dragged around its window would have made a huge difference.\nAdditional features include the ability to play each mission in either \"Lone\nWolf\" style or \"Terrorist Hunt\" once you've completed it normally. Lone Wolf\nputs you in a DieHard situation, where you simply have to escape on your\nown, and Terrorist Hunt takes out any hostages and puts in more terrorists\nto give the game a slightly more arcade feel. Terrorist Hunt is also available in multi player, which saves cursing when your mate uses a nun silenced weapon and all the hostages get wasted. Flaws aside, the planning element is still a vital and rewarding part of the\ngame( I love it when a plan comes together!). The action is also swift and smooth as long as you have a3D card, and if you have the patience to play it realistically rather than Quake style, it's great fun. You do have to\nplay lots of missions over and over, but it takes less time than joining the\nSAS, and it's safer.\nGe f "

While Mr Peterson may come from the same Radio 1 stable as Mr Nelson and Ms Whiley, he is the only one of the\nthree whose sound has not been\ndiluted by the experience of working on the biggest radio station\naround\nThe operating level of Gilles Peterson is therefore quite different to his\ncolleagues. With more influences in\nhis sound than there are books in\nthe library, his sound is matched by\nno other. Indeed this compilation provides the buyer with an item that\nis quite a rarity, as the album captures the best of both Gilles Peterson's radio and club DJ sets. There's all the funk, vibe and eclecticism\nthat you could imagine as the tunes\nrange from all-time classics to just-off-the-press fresh flav as. Giles Peterson is thus managing to\nmaintain his sound and culture in a minefield of blandness that brings\nso many down. While the sound of\nhis radio-and-label mates becomes more and more mainstream every\nweek, the sound of Giles Peterson\ngoes from strength to strength. Put\nsimply, the sound of Giles Peterson\ncan be summed up in one word incredible.\nJames\nBarry White\nStaying Power\n(BMG)\nThis album is the greatest piece of\nshite ever to be played on my stereo.\nI don't even know why we bother\nreviewing it. Barry White had his\nmoment. At some point or other he\nwas in some way at least a little bit\ncool. Yes, he does have the most\ninc rec i bly deep and sensuous voice,\nthe voice of sex. On this album though, he just sounds old and per-verte d. Hearing him say \"baby\"\nmakes me think of apa ed ophile trying to get his way with a child. Disgusting.\nThe music is so incredibly minimal is tic you hardly notice it. The lyrics are\nso diluted they make noodle soup\nsound poetic.\nThe album never takes off, it just\nflows, forever churning out mono to nous synthesised keyboard cac k,on top of which Barry White rambles on about getting up, laying down, and all the other perverted activities\ngoing on in his old-man head.\nDon't bother with this, even if it\ncomes free through your letterbox.\nDisa\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nJames & Ben say:\nSorry Disa, we can't agree. After listening to Mr White's latest offering\nextensively in the office we'd give it at\nleast a three. Okay it's cheese, but\nit's perfect for background music\nwhile we work. But who are we to\ncomment? Oobermann\nThe Magic Treehouse\n(Independiente)\nSince I'd only heard the name on the radio before reviewing this, I was half expecting some kind of\nTeutonic collective( as in \" uber alles...\") preparing to unleash electro Europa pon the world. I was the r fore pleasantly surprised to discover that Oo berman are in fact a) adopted S couse, and b) talented, debatable name aside. So Liverpool as the continuing spiritual home of catchy, innovative pop records? Well, probably. The album is a little slow to start,\nwith supposedly chart friendly previous singles Million Suns and Blossoms Falling being nothing much to shout about, but beyond these the standard is high. There's a lot happening on this\nalbum a hell of a lot. From up for-it mental ness( Bees, Sugar\nBum), to brief but engaging musical musings( My Baby's Too\nTall & Thin), to haunting multi layered symphonic beauty and splendour( Roll Me In Cotton,\nShorley Wall). All laced with wit,\nemotion and psychedelia, suggesting that the band had a rather good time recording this\nrecord. It may be said that the odd track\nbecomes more like background music, but from these first album beginning s,Oo berman should go far. Maybe even uber alles? Matt\nJoeStrummer\nRock Art and\nthe X Ray style\n(Mercury)\nFor those whose rock histories only\ngo back as far as when Take That\nsplit, Joe Strummer was frontman for\nThe Clash. London Calling, Rock\nThe Cas bah and I Fought The Law\nwere chief among a succession of\nclassic tracks starting from the\nQueen's Silver Jubilee year. This is\nonly his second solo effort in the thirteen years since The Clash disband ed.\nThe album is generally mellow, with\nreggae style guitar and a world\nmusic feel to several of the tracks\nsuch as Sandpaper Blues with its\nAfrican chanting. Strummer's voice\nwould at times still have difficulty giving Bob Dylan a run for his money\non tracks like The Road to Rock 'n' Roll and Yalla Yalta. So don't be put\noff singing along. Nitcomb is a laid-back jam about the minutiae of city\nlife, optimism tempered with resign a tion: 'Love buys a six pack and gives\nit to the bums'. He started from the\nWestway, so Willesden to Cricklewood, f he melodious final track,\nmay be a coming home song. No social climbing done there then.\nAn honest, and often uplifting\nalbum. It deserves to get some airtime even on A OR stations. Less confrontational than The Clash were,\nfans will still want to buy it. If you\nweren't into The Clash( or were too\nyoung then), it's worth a punt now.\nIan\n\n"

Kevin suggests ideas are emailed to mishmash@ic.ac.uk and they will be\npassed on. Please be inventive, Kevin would rather\nthe areas be in nominate, than find himself eating in\nthe \" Ox burgh Lounge\" or patronising \" Ronald' s\". DISTANCE LEARNING SUCCESS?\nKevin has been hearing a plethora of complaints\nfrom medical students about the abject failure of\nthe School of Medicine's new distance teaching\nvideo network. The team responsible has been\nrewarded with the prestigious: \"Rector's award for\nexcellence\". The baloney excuse for this bizarre act\ncurrently circulating ICS M has been that the award was, not for the new network, but for a promo tio nal video production: \"Training Tomorrow's Doc tors\", which features the system. Kevin suggests that\nif the fiasco is not over, and the system is not working perfectly, students should ensure their views are\nheard at the presentation on25 November.\nJOURNALISTS DESCEND\nWhy is College spending millions on the Beit rede-velo p ment? Better rooms for students and more\nspace for the Union hardly seem like the sort of\ncauses likely to receive major funding from IC. The\nsummer of 2 0 0 0 sees Imperial hosting a one-off\nevent billed as a showcase of British science for the\nMillennium. It is planned that Beit will house the\nworld's journalists, who will have use of the Union's new ' media suite'. Kevin hopes that ICU ensures\nthis situation is fully exploited to our advantage.\nMishMash A Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nLEAPING UP THE LEAGUE TABLE\nThe Rector, will be retiring from IC shortly after the\nstart of the next academic year. Beit, and the exhibition are just examples of the many efforts that are\nbeing made to ensure that he leaves in a blaze of\nglory. Kevin would not be at all surprised if efforts\nare being made to ensure the current trend of\nincreasing the proportion of First and Upper Seco nd Class degrees is accelerated. This could propel IC to the top spot in the league tables, the ultimate high note on which the Rector could leave.\nThis would obviously also be good for students,\nperhaps giving encouragement to some of those\nwho have become disenchanted on realising that if\nthey had attended almost any other university in the\ncountry, they would earn a better classification of\ndegree. There never has been a convincing explanation answer to the question: why when IC takes\nin such well-qualified students does it have such a relatively low proportion of Firsts being awarded? CONNECTIVITY.CONUNDRUM\nThe porta cabins, which are presently the home of\nFelix are still not connected to the College network.\nThis is a ridiculous situation for the student newspaper at the MIT of Europe. Kevin recalls that when\nThe Estates Division occupied the premises they\nwere connected to the Net. A cursory inspection by\nKevin's untrained eye reveals that the network\ncabling was not disturbed when estates moved out.\nThe solution that Felix have been waiting eight\nweeks for can't be as simple as someone from the\nCCS flicking a switch, ou ld it?\nComments on the state of the Union?

Before the\nmedics get excited at the prospect of\ntaking out their anger on the remains\nof the great ICS M architect, 1 mean of\ncourse, passing on to the ultimate old folks home, our noble House of\nLords. Keen political watchers will\nknow that while hereditary in cum bents of the House have only 7 5\nwords in which to justify their seats,\nSir Ron had the luxury of many more\n(in the form of the Dearing Report) to\nmake himself Tony's favourite scientific sco user, and guarantee his retire-ment.\nThe College Senate has appoint-eda selection committee to find his\nsuccessor. Obvious candidates for the job include Lord Winston (the\nnoted TV presenter and fertility specialist, based at IC's Hammersmith\nHospital), Professor Susan Green field, currently head of the Royal Institution, and Dr Arpa d Pusztai, recently\nthrust into the public eye with his oh-so-accurate research into GM foods.\nGiven your \u00a3 1 0 0 0 per annum share\nin Imperial College pic, Breakpoint\nfeels it right that you know who is in\nthe running, and has, at considerable\npersonal risk, broken into the Rector's Suite and discovered the following shortlist.\nSir Alexander Fleming\nAlready canonised as the new \"St. Mary\" by at least one-twenty-fifth\nof the College, has an impressive CV,\nclaiming to have discovered peni-cill in, and already has a College building named after him. Worrying\napplication form states will only take\nup the job if his lab technician can come with him to do all the work, so Fleming can take the credit.\nMichael Portillo\nOriginally thought to be more\ninterested in Alan Clark' s seat, Portillo stepped out as a surprise can di date when he heard that IC had a200ft tall Queen's Tower.\nAndy Heeps\nFormer President Jabba the Gutt\nwas last seen marching round the\nSherfield Building quoting the Union Constitution at all who cross his path.\nHis CV states that he has \" done the\nbloody job already\". Not favoured by\nCollege Administration as catering\nbudget limited. ICU's own Margaret Thatcher (he just won't piss off and annoy somebody else), suffers from\ndelusions of grandeur, and will probably resign at the first sign of trouble.\nAnakin Skywalker\nBorn a long time ago, in a galaxy\nfar, far away, this candidate has a forceful application form, but worrying early signs of a respiratory problem may be off-putting. Not thought\nto be the Senate's first choice - yet.\nStated intention to rebuild Imperial\nforces and bring us A New Hope. Can provide own black robes for Graduation Ceremonies. Breakpoint, however, has decided to\nback the dark horse candidate, aMr M Al-Fayed from Knightsbridge,\nbecause he is without doubt the best\nman for the job. Must dash now,\nhave to go and spend the contents of\nmy brown envelope at Harrods, a truly remarkable British shopping experience.\n\n"

    "content": "28 Films Felix \u2022 8 November 1999\nSo, the 43rd London Film Festival is here. It kicks off with the premiere of this\nfilm, which fully deserves its top billing. It is a film of quality, with superb acting\nand fantastic cinematography. Set in the American Civil War, this film will not\nbe your average IC student's cup of tea: there are no light sabres or flashy special effects, no Keanu Reeves wandering about with nice shades on. It is a film\nat the other end of the spectrum; it involves you by stirring your emotions and\ntelling a rousing story rather than throwing hundreds of computer generated\nimages at you. And what a nice change it is as well.\nThe film follows the fortunes of a group of pro-Southern Bushwhackers around\nthe Missouri-Kansas border in the 1 860's. For those of you who not up to\nspeed on your American Civil War history, I will quickly explain. In 1 854, the\nKansas-Nebraska Act was passed which meant that States had to vote on\nwhether they would allow slavery. They would then be either slave states or free\nstates. However violent conflicts in and around Kansas ensued with pro-slav-e ry settlers, allied with people from neighbouring Missouri, fighting anti-slav-e ry Kansas \"Jay-Hawkers\". Soon afterwards, the Civil War broke out, with Missouri (now a slave state) siding with the Northern Union, rather than the Southern Confederacy, i.e. most of the states surrounding it. What followed was division of loyalties, even between members of families and led to local militia\n\"Bushwhackers\" (pro-Confederacy) undertaking guerrilla warfare against the\nNorth's Union soldiers and sympathisers. The worst atrocity was the Lawrence\nMassacre (re-created in the film) in which the town of Lawrence was ransacked\nby pro-Confederacy militia with the loss of 1 80 lives.\nSo we follow in the trials and tribulations of a small band of men, firstly as they\nhide in the hills during the winter from the army, and then into the spring where\ndiffering opinions lead the group to disband. Leaving their companions\nbehind, Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and a former slave Daniel Holt (Jeffrey\nWright), try to put the violence and brutality behind them by heading south and\nmaking a new start for themselves. The characters having slowly realised that\nthe situation is hopeless and futile; the only people the Bushwhackers are\nkilling are innocents. They are not killing members of the army but their fam i lies. But the other members of his unit are not so sympathetic and would prefer to stay until the bitter end, showing that these men had no real humanity\nand were nothing short of animals.\nMaguire plays a difficult part excellently, as does Wright, but the whole cast\nmust be congratulated on a fine performance. The production of the film is first\nrate with director Ang Lee showing again (after Sense and Sensibility) that he\nis an accomplished period filmmaker. The emotions are stirred effectively by\nthe struggles of the central characters, while the realism is of war is often sickeningly displayed. You could do far worse than spending a few hours watching a film of this calibre.\nDrew\nOk, the cinema was in Brixton, it was a bit messy, everybody was trying to sell us \"puff\" and the number of people watching this preview\nequalled your average ICU presidential election voting turnout (about\neight). Bad omens for a film I knew nothing about having had the tickets thrust at me only hours before. \"It's got the doctor from Eastenders\nin it,\" was all the information I was told. Things started to look up when\nthe cinema started playing Big Band music in the time gap between the\nfilm starting and all eight people turning up. This was going to a British\nFilm and a very cool one at that. I wasn't let down.\nEast Is East' is set around a large Pakistani family living in Salford (the\ndirector's hometown) in 1 971. The father came over from Pakistan in\n1937, leaving behind his first wife, and married an English woman.\nThey raised seven children and run a chip shop. The father is determined to impose his Pakistani beliefs onto his offspring. One such\nbelief is arranged marriages. When he arranges for his two eldest sons\nto be married to two of the ugliest girls on the planet, things start to\nblow up in his face. Whilst this all sounds very serious, the whole plot\nrevolves around a set of comic set pieces, involving circumcision, the\nthick girl next door, the racist bigot across the road and one sons\nattempts at modern art.\nFrom the start it was obvious that 'East Is East' had a script with the calibre of a12 bore shot gun. Well written, sharp, witty, hilarious, touch-ing, sensitive and glorious are all words that could be used to describe\nthe script writing. One moment you are rolling about on the floor and\nthen before you know it you are almost crying at the sadness of the\nleading roles. This was not just due to the script. All of the actors managed to portray such a sense of realism that, even in some of the more\nobtusely funny scenes, your level of empathy was huge. You just\nbelieved in the characters and the story as a whole. This level of\ninvolvement is also heightened if you have ever had any Pakistani\nfriends who have gone through the whole arranged marriage thing,\nand helped them get through all the cultural clashes that go on when\nEast meets West. Another aspect that added to the atmosphere of the\nfilm was the attention to detail in the clothing and sets. It looked and\nfelt like a genuine 1971 Salford street.\nFilm Four has done it again: produced a low budget, all British, different but brilliant film. Ok, so I only recognised one actor and I haven'ta clue who the director is, but this film is fantastic, touching\nand hilarious and, for me, better than 'The Full Monty'.\nEddy\n\n"

ICS MIA depleted ICS M squad made the trek to one of the less\nsalubrious parts of South London to take on a talented and young G KT side. With four regular players missing, the voyage was made more in hope than true\nexpectation. However, despite the loss of many crucial members of the side, it was the return of Hugo Boyce that was to have the biggest influence on the match. His presence added both defensive steel and attacking flair to the critical centre midfield zone. The ICS M game plan revolved around absorbing pressure, and relying on rapid counterattacks. With the defence again working splendidly as a unit, and the midfield industrious in their tackling cover, it was left\nto Boyle and Hadfield to create chances at the G K Tend. The first\ngoal came from a short corner won from a counterattacking breakaway. The short corner strike from Fish pool worming and squirming through a sea of boots and sticks, before embarrassingly nudging the backboard. The G KT reply was swift\nand classy. A free hit to the edge of the area was blitzed across the D, and the hitherto anonymous G KT centre forward stole\nin front of his marker, to glance the ball in off the far post.\nThe second half saw the mid field area open up as fatigue set\nin. But the only goal of the half\nwas again scored on the counter, when a deft lob by Hadfield cleared the prostrate keeper for the match winner. ICS M thus gained three crucial away points, and G KT were sent back to the drawing board, perplexed at how to breakdown such solid defensive display. Rugby lads kick bucks\nRugby\nIC I41 Buckinghamshire Chilterns 7\nOnce again the lads started\nwell some goods c rummaging and ruc king. This week Jamie\" disco superman\" Dug g in started the game, but due to the fact that he' d had 2 8 pies and30 union curries\nbefore the game he wasn't quite as sharp as usual. The first try came from a strong run from Sven Jupp playing on the wing, quickly followed by a belly flop of a try by\nMatt the tw at. The third try came from another superb run by mon key man Stevns (a little greedy per-hap s?) Rainey yet again to score,\nexcept with his best mates bird!\nThere was excellent support from Dan and Tref, as well as the subs\nwho were in good voice. Craig Withers also had an awesome first\ngame for the 1 sts.\nThe opposition got in a flukey\ntry while the ref. wasn't looking and half their side were b latent ly off\nside. We increased the pace as half time approached but we couldn't force one through the gaps in their defence. The second half saw a decrease in performance but two class tries were scored and one not\nso classy try for Matt Poolip s, who came good with some nice runs\nand a well deserved try. Dave G.A.Y. Gol also scored a quality\n5 0 yard try with elusive running\nand great dummies. All in all a good game but we should have\nscored more. The ref was appalling, the coach driver was a knob, but good play and some good kicking form Hog gy lead to a good win.

Did you\nknow it has one of the largest screens in London and a brand new\namazing sound system. Well, now you do. This week ICU cinema is\nshowing the piss-your-pants funny South Park and hilarious Analyse\nThis. Both are definately five star films so if didn't get to see these films\nover the summer now's your chance.\nSouth Park (in case you haven't been on this planet for the last 12\nmonths) is an adult cartoon about four kids living in a town called\nSouth Park. There has been a TV series and mass merchandising so I think everyone knows what I'm talking about. This film is one of the\nfunniest films of the year and is a must see for all students. You will\nfind yourself quoting for weeks after this film so be warned. South Park\ncontains explicit language so if you don't like the word f*** and get\noffended by bad language don't bother watching this film. While the\nlanguage in the TV series in bleeped out, the naughty words in this film\nare not. Apparently, this film uses the F word more times than Pulp Fiction. Now that's an achievement.\nAnalyse This is a comedy starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. You\nprobably read the review in the first edition and never got to see it as\nyou were too busy doing Freshers Week. Well now you can see Analyse\nThis in the comfort of the Union. De Niro is a gangster (what a sur-p rise!) who has 'issues' and needs a psychiatrist to help him sort himself out. Crystal is the unfortunate psychiatrist who has to deal with\nhim. Also starring in Analyse This is Lisa Kudrow (Pheobe from Friends)\nwho's character is not that dissimilar to Pheobe. She plays Crystal's wife to-be. The film follows the antics of this off-the-wall patient-doc-tor relationship.\nBoth films are being shown on Monday and Tuesday evenings in the\nUnion but as always make sure you check the posters on the walkway\nor the advertisement somewhere in Felix for the times and details of\nprices. Ok, it doesn't show the latest blockbusters, but as least it's cheap and you can take your beer and curry in with you.\nICU Cinema is looking for staff to sell tickets, ice-creams and do other\nstuff so if you fancy getting to watch free films or would like to know\nhow a cinema works then get in touch with the cinema. Either ask the\npeople working at the cinema when you go this week or mail them at\ncinema@ic.ac.uk.\nscreen r~] East Is East Competition\nThis week's competition courtesy of the Odeon Kensington gives you\nthe chance to win tickets to see 'East is East'.

As the article\nin ICS M Bulletin made clear, the Rector's Award for Excellence was awarded to\" a video production entitled Training Tomorrow's Doctors\" not the AVIT system.\nThis video was used at an event held in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building in March at which many ICS M students were present.\nThe widely publicised timescales which are referred to in the\nletter were set out in the Position\nStatement about the AVIT System which I issued on29 June1999; this clearly states that interactivity\nwill be achieved\" on/ by6 October1999\". The position now is that the system is fully operational and interactive. There remains a number of commissioning details to be completed( balancing of lines\netc) but in essence the system is\nfinished. At a lecture a week or so ago, a quick briefing was given by the\ninstallation technicians to indicate how to use the system; that\nwas clearly not sufficient - neither\nthe students nor the lecturers were able to use such a complex system without much more thorough training and briefing. Therefore rather than use the syst em straight away with the danger of teachers being unaware of its\nfunctionality and capability and also the danger of students rejecting the system out of hand we are now embarking on a full\nprogramme of training to ensure that the system can be used properly and to its full capabilities. When staff are trained then the system will be used. Meanwhile it\nwill continue to be used in broad cast mode only.\nThis system is one of the most complex and sophisticated anywhere. It does of course rely on supporting technology( for exam ple for the quality of data transmission over the lines supplied by\nthe telecom s companies). I accept, as was made clear in June, that the situation has been very poor indeed and I repeat the apologies that have already been made. John Green, ICS M Secretary COLUMNISTS BITE BACK\nDear Editor,\nAlthough the column is non controversial( I suspect) this week, I really feel that I need to answer my critics directly - in particular Simon Baker's letter.\nHe says that \" it is impossible to do a good job without one's identity being widely known\". What rubbish. For the past three\nyears, the medics have roundly insulted Simon Baker for his column, often without reading it first.\nDoes Mr. Baker also realise how much misinformation was deliberately fed to him during his years\nat FELIX, simply because people knew who he was, particularly from the Union? Did this make his column better?\nSecondly, Mr. Baker failed: it\nIS extremely patronising to suggest that we should not attack\nICU. Last time I checked, FELIX\nhad not been renamed PRAVDA, and free opinions were still welcome. Break Point will not suck up to the President or any other union officer( in the way Mr. Baker was known to) to help cover up their misguided intentions. Tim Trail or, admirably, proved that this is not necessary as we finally got some explanation of his union policy in a very\nimportant\" field\". Mr. Baker goes on to suggest that I turn my many guns on the S her field Building, and it's Borg like occupants. Sadly for me,I do not have a pathological desire to know the cost of every new sign\nand tree that appears on the campus, and it is my opinion that\nhis many student colleagues do not either.\nKeep talking, Break point CONVERT CAUTIOUSLY Dear Felix,\nFollowing the editorial in\nissue l155 extolling the virtues of Cash Converters, can I just point out that a surprising number of the bargain CDs and videos on sale there are actually nicked( perhaps I should put allegedly in\nthere just in case anyone decides to sue for libel).\nThe source of this information is an old friend of mine who worked at the King sHeath branch in Birmingham for a year after\ngraduating. He tells me it was very common for dod gy looking blok es to come in with hundreds of CDs which they claimed were theirs and they needed to sell,\nusually for something ridiculous like ST LG2 each. Now everyone in the shop was convinced that they were actually stolen, but unless the person wanting to sell them act u ally says 'these are nicked', then\nat least legally the shop is in the clear because they are not know ingly handling stolen goods. The morality of the operation is rather\nmore questionable, and in fact\nmy friend finally resigned after a friend of his came into the shop to find aT Von sale which had been stolen from his girlfriend's flat the week before. I just thought I would point\nthis out, because personally I would feel bad about buying someone else' s stolen CD collection, because I knowhow long it\nwould take to replace my own if it\nwere stolen. Regards, Rob Leah The deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.\n\n"

    "content": "yj Big Issue Felix \u00ab 8 November 1999\nULU\nDAVID ROBERTS\nIn the heart of Bloomsbury there's a road called Mallet Street, and on the corner of that road you'll\nfind a Union building. Not an Imperial College Union building( the College hasn't taken over anywhere in Bloomsbury yet) but nonetheless every year the College hands the occupiers of that\nbuilding something in the region of \u00a3 1 5 0 0 0 0 on your behalf. Why? Because that building houses the University of London Union( UL U), the federal Union for the students of all University of\nLondon Colleges that's nearly\n1 5 0 0 0 0 students in all. Very\nnice... so what do they do? What they do\nLike theN US, the primary fun c tion of UL U is to act as a means of representing students on a wider scale than would be p ossi ble for any individual Union. By\nbringing together nearly 1 5 0 0 0 0\nstudents from across London, U LUcan claim to represent the\ninterests of a massive block of the\nlocal population, and consequently negotiate some fairly important deals. Until recently their reputation on this front was not much better than that of theN US however, with the intro duc tion last year of the London Tr an sport discount card scheme co ming almost entirely at the behest of lobbying from U LUre ps, they\ncan truly be said to have achieved a significant gain for their stu dents. The challenge, now, how ever, is to follow this up with fur ther major initiatives - at present student discounts at supermarkets is the pet-project of choice for UL U sabbaticals. Like all student union's, there's also a great deal of focus on we l fare issues, and the Male t Street\nbuilding houses an Advice Centre( with it's own dedicated staff) as well as an Education and Welfare sabbatical. However, like much of\nwha tULU does, this facility is\nalmost entirely mono polis ed by\nstudents at the smaller Blooms bury College's after all, how many students are going to trek\nacross London to find help when they have specialist advisors, counsellors and guidance centres\non campus? The third string of the standard union remit is clubs and societies, and consequently you'll\nfind a wide range of student groups based at UL U HQ they\neven have their own student newspaper. London Student( in\nterms of circulation, the largest\nstudent newspaper in Europe). Again, however, these generally serve to replicate and duplicate what'son offer at any of the lar ger College's( UCL, QM W,I C, LSE,\nKing's, Holloway and the like) -and the range certainly can't compare with what you'll find at\nICU. The one key difference is the\nspecial BUS A entry arrangements. Under the terms of a special deal, wherever there is no serious interest in putting individual college teams into national sporting competition, aULUs ide can be entered to represent the entire\nUniversity. Consequently, marshal artists, athletes and lacrosse and ko rfb all players can( and do) take part in national contests as members of UL U squads. Sport\nIn sporting terms, however, UL U's key role is the coordination of all\nUniversity of London League and Cup competition. Indeed, one of UL U's most high profile ( and valuable) contributions to it's students\nis the provision of this second tier\nfor College sport, providing a year long alternative to tough BUS A contests. Crucially, this\nmeans that College's can boast a genuine \"Sport for all\" approach as, unlike BUS A competition where a maximum of four squads are allowed per competition, UL U allow as many teams to enter\ntheir contests as a college canfield. Thus, whilst IC can only enter four ICU and four ICS MSU teams into BUS A football, we can enter around a dozen teams( including squads from RCS and RSM) into the myriad of UL U Leagues, producing suitable com petition for players of all ability.\nThe other big benefit of the UL U League and Cup system is to provide a winning environment for sport in London. Because even the largest London college is\nsmall on a national scale, and because Central London locations tend to make regular tra i ning difficult, it'shard for our sides\nto compete on a national scale( note that last year an incredibly good season for IC sport - we still\nonly managed to reach two BUS A finals) - and consequently UL U sport provides a more realistic\nframework within which we can compete... and win. Looked at\nfrom a different point of view,\nhowever, the fact that ICU sides\nplay teams from the weaker small colleges week after week could be seen as part of the problem. After all, how can we expect to\nget better unless we play against good teams on a regular basis? It's a question that's bound to be asked a lot over the next few months, as the issues surrounding dual, single and hybrid entry (see\nIssue 1 1 5 4 ) move to the fore... Funding\nPart of the charter for the University of London as a whole says that\nthere must be a federal Union for\nthe University, and consequently every College in UL is locked into\npaying for UL U in the case of IC,\nthat means handing over funding\nof around \u00a3 1 5 0 0 0 0 on an an nu al basis (that's around a sixth of\nwhat the ICU as a whole receives).\nConsequently, although various\ncolleges across London( including\nIC) occasionally talk of d is a ff ili at ing from UL U, the question has to\nbe asked: is there any point? After\nall, it's not the Union that's paying,\nit's the College, and all signs seem\nto suggest that if ICU were to\nleave the federal body they wouldn't receive an extra penny and\nuntil that situation changes, there's noway anyone is really\ngoing to leave UL U...

But\nwhen we got to the pitch, we\nfound not only a full team but\none with plenty of subs. As\nthere were only 8 of us (since\nUnderdown had a rather too\ngood night at Scandies the\nnight before and was deemed\nto ill to play, plus a few others\nwho missed the coach), Chunderbird kidnapped 3 football\nplayers, Marie, Vasso and\nSarah whilst the team battled\non. Despite the fact that the\nopponents had a full team and\nwe only had 8, we were storming and whilst the football girls\nwere having a quick lesson at\nhockey on the sidelines , Katie\nsneaked a crafty one past the\ngoalie and we were 1 - 0 up.\nThe football girls were at times\na little confused by the rules of\nhockey, but they were great.\nHalf time came and went\nquickly and we continued in\nstyle. Patsy's classy goal swiftly\nfollowed and we were on a roll.\nGeorge's had a shot at goal but\nthat was easily dismissed by our\nfabulous goalie Louise. That\nwas the only attempt they had\non goal. After this slight shock,\nthe girls were back to work and\njust before full time, TinkyWinky cunningly defected the\nball into the net making our victory complete. Just as well we\nturned up, otherwise it would\nhave been a60 defeat for us.\nOnce again we are grateful to\nthe football girls Marie, Vasso\nand Sarah and we'll return the\nfavour soon.\nSun. 31st Oct.\nIC Ladies 2\nLSE 1\nThe witches of LSE tried their best\nto cast their spell on IC this\nHalloween but failed. Ex-IC\nstriker Juliet was up to her\nusual tricks, hacking our\ndefence down and LSE hadn't changed a bit since we beat\nthem last year 1 -0.\nIC went ahead after about\n15 mins thanks to Marie's diving header off a flicked on cor-ner. From then on it was an\nevenly matched game of offside\nping-pong mostly due to great\ndefensive tactical manoeuvres\nfrom both sides. Jasmine slid\none away after a cross/shot\nskidded across the goal face\nand Juliet put one past our\nstand in keeper Mel to leave it\n2-1 to IC at full time.\nWed. 3rd Nov.\nIC Ladies\nQMW\nQMW beat us 9-0 the previous\nweek, mainly because only 9 people turned up for the match. This\nweek, with a full team and three\nsubs, we felt we were in with a chance. The game was almost\nevenly matched in the first half\nhour. IC had a few chances but\nlacked finishing touches. QMW\nfinally pierced through the IC\ndefence, but we were back in the\ngame with an excellent individual\neffort from Becky. With the score\n1 - 1 30 seconds from half time, we\nstill felt we were in with a chance to\nget three points from the game, but\na lack of chances in the second\nhalf didn't yield any more goals.\nQMW were luckier, winning the\ngame with a shot going in off the\npost from outside the area.\nIC shooters in charge\nRifle Shooting\nLadies Rugby\nIC Virgins 35\nUCL 0\nOur winning ways continue its now\n3 out of 3. A period of intense\npressure straight from kick off led\nto a penalty that Romy duly con-verte d. We were then straight back\nat them again and after a long\nperiod of pressure Romy crashed\nthrough to score, and then converted her try. Despite excellent play by\ntheir fly half, our forwards were\nstunning and no. 8 Claire powered\nthrough 5 players to score. An\nexcellent break by Clare allowed\nJoe to score her 1 st try. Then Betsy\nscored a runaway try to complete\nthe half. The good play continued\ninto the second half and we were\nstarting to look impressive. After\nspending much of the half in\nscrum s. We ended up on their line\nand Kate went over in the comer\nfor her debut try. The game finished\nwith another try from Betsy. Well\ndone to Jessamy Miriam and\nEmma for their 1 st matches.\nRs. You're not supposed to\nlaugh at Kryzi's conversion attempt\nwhen you were all too chicken to\ntry.\nFootball\nIC I4 ICSM 1\nFrom the start, I.C.l sts controlled\nthe play. Slick passing throughout\nthe team left the defence a little\nbored, so bored in fact that the\nmedics managed to take the lead\nwith their first, and last chance of\nthe half. Finishing proved to be a slight problem for most of this\ngame with numerous chances\ngoing begging. The score was\nfinally levelled just before half-time\nwhen Marcos found out he could\nkick again!\nThe second half followed the\nsame pattern as the first: loads of\nchances, loads of misses. Nak\nfinally gave the 1 sts a well-earned\nlead finishing from close range\nafter a slapstick goal mouth scram-ble. The third came from Private\nWaight, scoring with his head from\nSteve's corner. The best goal of all\ncame next with Marcos scoring\nagain after a controlled build up,\nto wrap up the game.\nAt the end of the day, a comfortable win for the l sts, and the\nmargin of victory could easily have\nbeen more.\nDuring the summer, three members of the Imperial College\nUnion Rifle and Pistol club\nentered the National Rifle Association's130 th Imperial Meeting.\nThis event attracted over a thousand competitors from all over\nthe world for two weeks of individual team matches.\nIn the individual competitions\nPhilip Golds scored an excellent\n49.7 (ex 50.10) in the 900 yard\nConan Doyle competition to finish 59th and was placed in the\nClementi Smith and Elkington\naggregates. Gareth Hillier shot\nwell in his first proper Bisley\nmeeting, being placed on five\nprized lists including 14th in the\nAdmiral Hutton Tyro Trophy.\nAndrew Eldridge made the top\nfifty in six competitions, including\n6th place in the final of the St\nGeorges Prize.\nAll three IC shooters shot for\nUniversity of London in the BUSA\nteam matches. Against opposition from Bath, Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Nottingham,\nOxford, Reading and Southampton universities, London came\nfourth in the musketeers (short\nand middle distances), 2nd in the\nuniversity's long range and 1 st in\nthe universities aggregate match-es. Andrew also shot for the winning England team in the Universities National Match.\nThe social side of the meeting\nproved equally enjoyable with\nevents such as the annual University of London Hog Roast, which\ncatered for over 120 people and\ninvolved the cooking of a whole\nlamb and a pig on the barbecue.\nPhil and Gareth narrowly avoided\nbeing put on the barbecue them-selves, having arrived wearing\npolo shirts bearing the legend\n\"Smallbore: for men who don't need big guns\"\nAl! in all, the meeting proved\nvery successful for the shooters\nrepresenting IC. Our thanks to\nICU for their support of entry.\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\nCults threaten Union Council disruption\nGARETH MORGAN Imperial College Union has been warned of the chance of d is rup tion to tomorrow's Council by a fundamentalist Islamic group called Alma haS har in. The University of London Union has alerted the London colleges, as the group are apparently threatening to disrupt Student Union meetings. The group has homophobic and antiSemitic views, and Union officers have been warned about the possibility of harassment. The Metropolitan Police are apparently taking the matter seriously; both Scotland Yard and College Security may make their\npresence felt at Council. Religious groups who are not ICU clubs were not given stalls at the Freshers' Fair, and were prevented from using Union noticeboards during October, although they\nmay now use them. A recurring issue has been the College branch of Christian Union. They are prevented from becoming a nICU club because their const it u tion requires their officers to sign a declaration of faith, which contravenes the Union's equal opportunities policy, but is required by\ntheir own funding rules. Christian Union are currently trying to rewrite their constitution in away that is acceptable to both parties.\nIn the meantime, ICU President\nTasha Newton has issued a war ning about the ' London Church of Love', a group who are sending out email questionnaires, offering the chance to become a priest. It\nasks for a credit card number, which is then stolen, and the owner threatened. Anyone who receives this email should in form the Centre for Computing Services (ccs help@ ic.ac.uk), en clo sing a copy of the email. Menigitis victim turns onto the road to recovery\nSUNIL RAO Meningitis, the killer disease already notorious for hitting students across the country, has struck again this time much clo ser to home. On Saturday30 October, a resident of Falmouth Keogh Hall( part of the Southside complex in Princes Gardens) was admitted to hospital, with sym p toms of what was soon confirmed to be men in go co c cal septic a emi a. The student, a male Biochemistry fresher, is now apparently stable recovering, with his parents\npermanently by his bedside. He is\non the road to along, slow but steady recovery.\nWhen contacted, Tasha New ton, Imperial College Union President, said \"I think that it is a real ly sad thing to happen, and I hope that he is in the thoughts and prayers of everybody at Imperial, and that we'll all be looking after\neach other even more closely now.\"\nThe disease is caused by the men in go co c cal bacteria which reside in the nose and throat and are passed on through prolonged intimate contact. There is no greater risk of catching the dis-ease from an affected person than\nfrom the general public, unless\nyou have been in extremely close contact with the individual. As a precautionary measure people should be vigilant over the next\nfew days; be especially watchful of\nyourself and your friends as the symptoms can suddenly develop very rapidly.\nEarly symptoms a feeling of\nfeverish ness, nausea, severe headache, and a stiff neck and back accompanied by joint pains can appear characteristic of\ninfluenza or a hangover. However, within a matter of hours, this can grow into something more seri-o us, so it is recommended that\nyou get a friend or friends to checkup on you regularly. It is\nabsolutely imperative that you seek urgent medical attention if\nthese symptoms are not relieved\nby standard over the counter medication. Although vaccination is now standard practice for First\nYears, this does not offer protection from all forms of the disease. Vaccinated students should not ignore possible symptoms. Prompt treatment is absolutely necessary if any of the following symptoms are exhibited: \u2022 a rash of small red bruises\nthat do not fade under pressure (say from a glass)\n\u2022 a severe dislike of or feeling of\nunease at light\n\u2022 a feeling of disorientation and/ or drowsiness Further advice can be obtained from the following sources, which offer professional and confidential advice: \u2022 Imperial College Health C en tre, Prince's Gardens ring\n0 2 0 7 5 8 4 6 3 0 1 (external),\n4 9 3 7 5 and49376( internal\nextensions)\n\u2022 Meningitis Research Found ation - 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 3 3 4 4\n\u2022 The National Meningitis Trust\n- 0 1 4 5 3 7 6 8 0 0 0\n\n"

Non-lyrical insights into her character, however, were not\nabundant since she was not in a very con ver sive mood. Instead, she let\nher singing do the talking (if you see what I mean) and impressed the\nentire audience with her incredible voice. It is in a live context that singers\ncan really prove themselves; the mediocre can splice together the best stud io takes on record, but there is no room for error on stage. Orton justified her enviable reputation during her 1 V2 hour set last Saturday, which\nincluded a new, apparently untitled song( although I'd hazard a guess at\nSo Long) and a cover version of The Ronette's/ Wish I Never Saw The Sunshine.\nFor most of that time she remained un spectacularly rooted to the centre\nof a sizeable stage in a dappled, pure white spotlight. She was joined by\nan 8-piece band( including a mandolin player and string section) who filled out the sound effectively and permitted her to ditch the guitar for a few songs, during which time she seemed to loosen her up a little. Lack\nof energy afflicted the crowd too, although this probably had less to do with the better-than-average support band, Doves, than the age demographic of the audience( i.e. there were a lot of old fogies about).\nThings changed when Beth revealed that she was to be joined for a duet\nby one of the collaborators on her Central Reservation album, Terry Col lier, who had himself played a couple of gigs at the Empire during Octo ber. Half the crowd was ecstatic; the other half were left asking their mates\nwho the hell he is. Visibly, Beth was one of those excited by his presence.\nThey performed some of his songs, and the pair's voices worked well\ntogether. It's just a shame that the last song of along encore was spoilt by\nmisunderstandings between them and technical difficulties - it was a rare\nslip. Clearly, the dance able beats from the records were absent in this live\nset, but this was no great loss, it just meant that nobody could hide behind expensive producers. I shall refrain, however, from saying that we were\ntreated to folk music, since 'folk' is one of those words( like 'country &\nwestern' and 'Belgium') which just makes me turn off. That would be unreasonable: Beth Orton deserves a good listen.\nBeth Orton' s Central Reservation album is out now. To win a copy and some other goodies enter the competition to the right\nValmik\nFear Factory @ Brixton Academy\n.. heavy metal rocks!...\nSay what you will about metal - \"It's just a load of old noise... That blok e's just\nshouting... They have silly shorts, etc\" - but for sheer emotional impact, this\nstuff works better than any Oasis ballad or Italian opera. Tonight's incredible\nshow was both draining and cathartic. First up: Will Haven. It starts with feedback. The band come on in suits and promptly explode, followed quickly by the mosh pit. The music simply shreds the air to pieces. The\nband sway, jerk and thrash about, caught in the maelstrom of noise they're\nunleashing. With something this intense, this primal, you become enveloped\nand suffocated by it, until there's no option other than to scream along and\npump your fist in the air. The sense of fear and anger expressed onstage is ail-too human. It ends with feedback. Totally inspirational.\nNext: Fear Factory. For nine years, they've been honing their brand of industrial metal to a brutal art. The music seems so inhumanly precise, what with the\nplayers stabbing out riffs like machines, and the machine-gun drummer. How ever, it's prevented from being a clinical exercise by frontman Burton. He doesn't play guitar, so he's free to connect with the audience, providing that human link the music needs. His crooned choruses and rallying cries to jump higher\nand sing louder make the vital difference.\nAnd then Gary Num an comes on, and I'm suddenly reminded why Fear Factory are able to fill such a large venue to breaking point. Their cover of Cars' is very big stateside. Thematically, it's the correct song for them to do, concerned as it is with their favourite subjects of technology and machines, but\ntonight it just sounds like the original played at twenty times the volume. One glitch in an otherwise routinely excellent show. Face facts: Metal is great.\nKunal\n...Competition News...\nBETH ORTON:\nWIN, WIN, WIN!!

Today I'd like\nto start off by thanking everyone for the tremendous response we got to last\nweek's Death in Vegas com petition. One lucky reader got lucky and David Lewis\ngot a brilliant night out with\nnine friends courtesy of Felix,\nCarling and Death in Vegas.\nThis week we've got a Beth\nOrton competition with some lovely prizes including some signed CDs. If you want to\nget lucky you've got to enter.\nSo do so now (see page21 for details).\n... frequency...\n... james rants...\nAs for the rest of my rant, I'd like to pick up on letter on the lack of drugs articles in\nFelix that appeared on these\nhallowed pages last week. We all know that Ed's dope obsession proved to be\nquite a feature last year and I suppose we will all miss his\nviews. Anyway, drugs have always been an important ingredient in music and clubs and I think that it's about time we ran some articles within the pages of\nfrequency. Any articles, views, rants would be\nappreciated and if you send me any stuff, an ony mn it y is\nassured. I know that there\nare more than just a few of\nus around campus who are\nquite different at weekends to the way we are during the\nweek. Make it large l Westtife\nWestiife\n(RCA)\nNow, there are many reasons to dislike Westiife: they describe themselves as\na 'Boy Band'( a collective noun more abhorred than the Tory Party), they don't write their own music, they can't play instruments and they wear those match ing puffer waistcoat things.\nOf course, they've been hugely successful (another thing we hate in this\ncountry), having recently perched quite happily at the top of the charts with\ntheir third number one single Flying Without Wings. And this their self-titled\ndebut album will, no doubt, take up residence at the same spot in the album chart, as they relentlessly recruit the nation's youth into their fan base.\nThese five Irish blok es do have an advantage over their 'Smash Hits' peers,\nhowever,, inasmuch as they have been favourably touched by the hand of\nSaint Ronan. And if you're going to be managed by anyone then how about,\nu m,oh yes, the lead singer of the band who practically wrote the Boy Band Handbook. Pretty good start really, and it does avoid all those usual tabloid\nheadaches of headlines screaming about infighting and the despotic management versus a bunch of naive young scamps. They're Irish. They're all\nnice guys.\nOk, so it's easy to be cynical but I'm afraid I actually quite enjoyed Westiife.\nObviously, they're not breaking any musical frontiers but then are we expecting them to? It begins with the debut and number one single Swear It Again.\nThis is a cute ballad that will have you tapping your foot by the end no matter how hard you resist.\nWith seventeen tracks and over an hour of music they are being ambitious -even the most devoted will be waning by the end. There's a bad choice of\ncover version half way through in the form of the ultra na ff Seasons in the\nSun (why?) and Extreme's More than Words. I'd be hard pushed to predict\nanother number one but I would guess it would be from amongst the first\nhalf, possibly Moments which stands out from some of the other more\nmediocre tracks.\nThis is not a brilliant album and what they do is not original, but at least they\nare doing it better than most. I need only to direct you to track two - also a number one - If I Let You Go. This song is fantastic. Okay, lyrically it's not\nChaucer but it has one of the most infectiously sing along choruses since /\nWill Survive. This is true sing your heart out in front of the mirror, classic pop. It's fun. And what is pop music for if not for that?\nRachael\n\u2022 \u2022\nIan Brown\nGolden Greats\n(Parlophone)\nThe years since the acrimonious and\nundignified collapse of the Stone Roses\nhave seen the former band members try\nand fail to recreate past glories. John\nSquire gave us the cynical, market-led disaster that was the Seahorses. Gary 'Mani'\nMountfield fell on his feet and joined Primal Scream. Ian Brown's first album, Unfinished Monkey Business was a pastiche of only half realised ideas and\nunused Roses outtakes, dominated by his\nbitterness towards Squire, and particularly\nthe guitarist's cocaine use.\nIn this context Golden Greats comes\nacross as a small, but not insignificant, tri-u mph. The inauspicious opener Getting\nHigh is compounded by the diabolical\nelectro-funk of current single Love Like A Fountain. However from here on in the\nMonkey King finds his rhythm. 'Jingle jan-g le, here's the jailer' snarls Brown on Free\nMy Way, as Her Majesty's prison sen/ice\nfeels the full force of his bile. Somewhat\nun surprisingly, given our hero's recent\ndetainment following an air rage incident,\nfreedom is a recurrent lyrical theme.\nAlbum highlight So Many Soldiers' masterfully weaves a desolate, absorbing path.\nLate in the day things start to get strange\nwith Dolphins Were Monkeys emerging\nfrom portentous origins to reveal one of\nthe albums rare tunes. Finally we come to\nthe stunning Sabasonicos, the languid and\nfragile result of a collaboration between\nIan and some South American chums. A fitting finale to a record which is intermittently wonderful, but seldom less than\ninteresting and intense.\nThe Masked Bandit\n\n"

Felix News 3\nCocktail of Chaos Major Mines Makeover\nJAMES HOLIAN\nThe annual fresher's chemical engineering cocktail party was a night\nmost of the revellers would like to\nforget. The Chemical Engineering\nSociety had planned a lightly al co hol fuelled evening of November2, fun for students and lecturers alike.\nHowever, they did not expect the\nnight of tumult that ensued. The engineers, usually known for their Herculean capacity for alcohol, began dropping like flies\nsuspiciously early in the evening.\nThe event soon became a wild affair\nwith rows breaking out all over and it was not long before college security arrived on the scene. Tuesday\nevenings are not generally known for their excitement and the required\nsecurity presence at the event pulled\ncollege security to full stretch. One security officer commented that dedicated security staff should be employed for these events in future.\nThe evenings mess reached its\npeak when one undergraduate member of the Chemical Engineering department was found face\ndown on the concrete just off the\nmain walkway. Having consumed a plentiful amount of alcoholic cock tails it was thought that the delinquent maybe suffering from toxic\nshock. An ambulance was duly\ncalled and took the casualty to the\nnearby Chelsea& Westminster hos pital. It is understood that an overnight stay in the ward was required with a drip to clean out the\nvictims system, but a stomach pumping procedure was not required. Some victims of the night\nheld those serving the drinks responsible for plying the traditional mixtures with copious vodka. Members of the Chemical Engineering Society, the organisation\nwho organised the event, declined\nto comment as Felix went to press.\nHowever, it is understood that no further action will be taken against\nany of the guilty parties.\nRICHARD HOE Y Funding shortages have disrupted\nplans to refurbish the Royal School of Mines. The building is amongst the shabbiest in the University, but\na full makeover would have cost a massive90 million pounds. It\nwould have also taken many years,\ncausing serious disruption to the hundreds of students and staff it\nhouses.\nA strategy is now being devised\nthat involves development of the building in several phases. This way the majority of the Royal School of Mines can remain open during refurbishment work. Estates manager Ian Caldwell told Felix that the\ninitial aim of the project is to bring\ntogether key infrastructure such as lecture theatres, IT facilities and library space, which are currently\nscattered all over the building. These will instead be centralised\naround the staircases and new lifts.\nThe Materials department and the\nPhoto: Archive\nHuxley school, which are currently\nspread over a number of buildings,\nwill also be brought together in the\nnew-look School. These proposals will cost an estimated 8 million pounds. An HE FCE grant has been applied for under the \"Poor Estates Initiative\",\nbut money may also be raised\nthrough the sale or lease of the Management School building. The department would then be moved into the Royal School of Mines, although it is not known how keen it will be to comply with such a plan.

These range\nfrom infiltrating the Russian ambassador's embassy( what no ferrer o rocher?) to the unforgettable Eurostar train scene. The game is 'a la\nTomb Raider1\nmost of the time with the view\nbeing from behind the character, although you can switch to a first person perspective when you are carrying a weapon for aiming purposes. The control is pretty straight forward, and an initially\ntricky system of changing what you are holding soon becomes second nature. The graphics, while being nothing spectacular, are perfectly\nacceptable and the regular cut scenes help the\ngame along nicely. Add the sound and music\nand an atmospheric gaming environment is generated. The gameplay is sometimes varied from the normal mode to alternative ones, notably\ncontrolling two rooftop snipers in one level and a puzzle like sequence when trying to avoid laser\nbeams in another.\nMISSION-.IMPOSSIBLE for the Playstation is full\nof neat features, such as the option that allows\nyou to save halfway through a level so that\nshould you fail you need not repeat the entire\nstage again.

    "content": "8 Interview Felix \u2022 8 November 1999\n2500 students. \u00a3120 million. Five campuses. One School of Medicine.\nOne Principle. So Chris Edwards, Principle of iCS M, what do you do?\nHow would you describe your job?\nIn one way or another, the\nMedical School represents around half of the College; it brings in 51 %\nof the research income, represents\naround50% of the College payroll\nand has 2 5 % of the students.\nIn essence, my role is to fulfil\nthe Medical School's mission: to\nbecome a centre of international\nresearch and to provide world-class\nteaching. I'm also responsible to the\nGeneral Medical Council for the\nquality of our courses... when the\nGMC produced their paper called \"Tomorrows Doctors\" it precipitated\na major restructuring in medical teaching. It recommended a decrease in teaching a stream of\nfacts and an increase in self-learn-ing. Consequently we've introduced a new course that is unique in the\nUK in the way that the modular BSc\nelements are taught, which I think\nwill become critical as the relevance of science to medicine becomes increasingly important in\nthe 21 st Century.\nHow would you describe the merger?\nWe've done what you'd never\nwant to do merge two undergraduate teaching schools, two postgraduate schools, several different\ncourses, a variety of campuses and a brand new building. Naturally, it's a very stressful process, but my job is to hold the whole thing together\nand show everyone the advantages of the merger; the bigger picture\nthat we're all working towards. Critically, we need to incorporate the\nethos and traditions of all the older schools and then build in our own new ideas, and thus create some thing that's greater than the sum of\nit's parts.\nHow does that effect teaching?\nThe structure of a typical old style London medical school simply\nwasn't compatible with 2 1 st Cent ury medical teaching. The situation\nwas analogous with Noah' sArk, with the consultants going in two-by-two, so that if one was absent\nthere would always be proper cover which was a very good system\nwhen there was less emphasis on research. Now, however, there is a need to translate research into clinical practice, which in turn requires\nmergers to generate far greater critical masses, because world-class\nresearch needs an enormous base... This also means that students are being taught by people who are at the cutting edge of their\nfield and can thus excite and inform\nas they teach, providing a much more beneficial environment for\nour students. Moreover, the shift\nfrom basing teaching entirely\naround learning by rote to a much more practical approach means that students are far more likely to\nremember what they've been taught\nand learn in a more meaningful way.\nNonetheless, there's still a big\nfactual base, and consequently the\nGMC have forced us to identify our core courses and focus on them which is a really tough process,\nbecause every professor or lecturer\nwould like to think that what they\nare teaching is essential. However,\nwe've been really ruthless and consequently we've managed to free up far more time for practical learning. We're always going to be faced\nby the problem of geography. Consequently, we've set up the interactive video link system, which is just\ncoming on line, which is a very\nimportant part of our plans for the\nfuture.\nHow important is research?\nUnlike the other rest of Imperia l, research in the Medical School doesn't map directly on to conventional departments. Consequently we've developed a structure consisting of a series of cognate research\ngroups which act horizontally across the vertical lines of our departments and divisions to integrate research in a meaningful way.\nThe other critical element of\nensuring quality research is recruiting and retaining the best people. So, I spend a lot of my time meeting people and trying to sell them the vision. I'm also working to build\nbridges with other departments - it\nwould be idiotic to have an isolated\nMedical School, completely sep a rate from the rest of the College, so\nwe have numerous inter depart men tal projects currently in operation. Indeed the first thing I did when I visited Imperial back in 1 9 9 5 was to set up six audit groups to look at\nthe work of the separate Medical Schools, and one of these was designated to specifically look at what medical research was already going on in the Old College... What's your relationship with the\nNational Health Service?\nWe are critically dependent on the NHS for the delivery of our curriculum and for access to patients\nfor clinical research. In return, the\nNHS gains a great deal of expertise\nand access to cutting-edge techniques. The formation of ICS M has\nhad an extraordinary effect on the\npattern and delivery of health care in London, and we remain at the\nforefront of this process as alea ding partner in the West London Partnership Forum( which consists of\nICS M, representatives from NHS West London and the Chief Executives of all the local trusts).\nThe Forum helps to highlight\nspecial areas and bring services\ntogether, leading to the develop ment of the Strategic Outline Case( currently under consideration by\nthe Secretary of State) which suggests a series of major relocation s for our research divisions.\nWill what you're doing here set an\nexample that other medical schools\nwill be following?\nAspects of what we're doing are\ncertainly under very close scrutiny\nfrom other Medical Schools there\nis a great deal of interest in our new\ncourse structure, and G KT are loo king at the possibility of introducing\na AudioVisual link-up system very\nsimilar to our own. Moreover, the\nCouncil of Heads of Medical Schools( which I happen to be the\nchair of at present) meets regularly\nand provides a means to bring all\nthe schools together.\nIn terms of student numbers, is bigger always better?\nThe results of the Research\nAssessment Exercise seem to show\nthat there is a minimal size (some-thing in the region of forty people\nper group) beneath which research\nseems to suffer, so size clearly is an advantage. On the other hand, there is always the danger that students will feel lost in an anonymous, amorphous Medical School, and so we're looking at ways of creating smaller groups within the student body which will ensure that\nevery individual feels noticed and cared for.\nFinally, when will the merger\nprocess finally be complete?\nWith so many courses currently\nrunning, it's critical that we move\nthe ends of all our current courses\ntowards the style of our new course,\nso that noone feels that they're\nbeing sold yesterday's goods. Ultimately, mergers are never\ncomplete... there will always be the\ntension of local geography. What we've done is to avoid basing divisions or courses at individual sites,\nso that groups meet upon a cross-campus basis and provide the glue\nthat holds the system together.\nNonetheless, they'll always be\nalumni with their own visions of\ntheir old medical schools which is\nfine, but we must persuade them\nthat their old traditions and ethos\nhave not been lost, and will all be\nincorporated into the new Medical School which we're building.

Half an hour into it and I was praying for\nthe crucifixion, just to end the whole terrible charade. The play was billed as a controversial take on the Jesus Christ Bible stop/ and was hot from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With that sort of hype, it was off to a bad start... and it\ngot worse and worse. The story cast Jesus as a homosexual southern Baptist\npreacher, the Disciples as his gay lovers and God as Woody Allen.\nI should confess that Iam not religious and certainly not homophobic and therefore went in suffering from controversy fatigue. Sure, it might offend some right-wing vicars and those blue-rinse Surbiton wives who hold coffee-morn-in gs. Actually, the more vocal of God's people were protesting outside in the\nstreet, guarded by a few fed-up police. They were singing Gospel songs and telling us the error of our wicked ways. This was the most exciting event of the\nevening, by far. I almost went over to thank them for it.\nBut what of the play? I must admit that there were a few amusing moments,\nlike the self-conscious tableau of the Last Supper. There was still too much religious singing, though. And the 'controversy bits' when the men French kissed\nweren't all that controversial. The plot structure was oh-so-confused. The playwright (Terrence McNally) had updated some aspects of the story, with Jesus'\nearly life set circa 1 9 5 0 in Corpus Christi, Texas. (Why, you may well ask. I certainly did.) Then McNally must have got lazy and everything went back to the\nusual setting in Israel with Pontius Pilotte and his chums. Slavishly following the\nstory without any trace of irony made the whole thing seem like a New Age Christian conversion session.\nMy God, can I think of anything good to say about this play? I find it hard to\ncriticise the actors; in fact, I feel deeply sorry for them. They all worked hard\nand were on stage for the full two hours, which is no mean feat even for pro-fess ional s. They certainly did the best they could with the dire material given to\nthem. Oh, and the crucifixion was quite grisly, and mercifully short. (I was\ndreading the fact that they might do the resurrection and drag the thing out\nfurther.)\nI can't think of any reason why anyone in the world (gay, straight, religious,\natheist) would ever go to see this dreadfully boring play. God only knows why\nthe theatre was packed on my visit. But maybe this bad play is a good sign of\nthe increasing equality between gay and straight: gay people can make\nappalling plays, just like all us straight people have been doing for millennial\nreMix, Jon Courtenay Grimwood\nreMix is the third book from Jon Courtenay Grim wood, whose previous cyberpunk works neo Add ix and Lucifer's Dragon, met with favourable reviews.\nreMix is your standard cyber-punk blend of corporate espionage, sex, vio-len ce, technology, sex and more violence, with various intertwined narratives.\nTaking place in what is essentially the William Gibson universe (complete with\nthe razor fingered Molly of Neuromancer and Mona Lisa Overdrive fame)\nreMix manages to go one better than the established formula. The book has\na somewhat wider scope than some of Gibson's books and certainly man ages to satisfy the requirements for violence and sexy Asian assassins.\nThe sub-plots themselves are too involved to summarise in any meaningful\nway, but the books has a little bit for everyone, from the Christian cult in space\n(very novel prayer techniques between the leader and his hand maidens) to\nthe steel eating virus sweeping across Europe and the Akira-type powers that\none character discovers that she possesses. Although not written with quite\nGibson's attention to atmospheric details, and somewhat less literary in its'\napproach, reMix succeeds because of its blend of black-humour, stunning\ntechnologies and sheer energy.\nIt rocks, enjoy.\nRussell\nCool Classics and Books You\nShould Have Read\nThe Alchemist, Paulo Coelho\nThe most successful book by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, the\nAlchemist has sold over 2 0 million copies in 4 2 languages.

During the\ncourse of Santiago's travels we are presented with the wisdom of Coelho, namely that it is always best to follow your heart and to heed the\nomens and sighs that fate presents us.\nThe more cynical among the Imperial College student population might\nhave something of a hard time with notions like, \" When you want some thing, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.\" or\"... the principle of favor ability, beginner's luck. Because life wants you to achieve\nyour destiny.\", but taken on a less analytical level, there may be some truth that you can take away from the book. Certainly this is a book that I would recommend to all final year students\nthinking about what to do after graduation, who might be tempted to forget about destiny or their dreams when focusing too intently on starting\nsalaries and bonus structures.

    "content": "8 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Feature\nThe Science\nSo, are we really all doomed? Well, the world is\nundoubtedly getting hotter, with figures released by\nthe US Governments Environmental Protection Agency showing that global mean surface temperature has increased by 0 . 5 - 0 . 6 \u00b0 C in the last hundred years, with\nthe ten hottest years in this period falling in the eighties and nineties and1998 officially declared the\nwarmest year on record. However, in global terms the\npicture is much more complex: night-time lows are rising about twice as fast as day-time highs; similarly wi nter temperatures are warming fast whilst summer temperatures seem to show little trend. Moreover, a large\nsection of leading experts are unconvinced that the\natmosphere is warming in conjunction with the sur-face, as satellite data does not show any warming trends, and consequently insist that we still have much to learn about the physics behind global climate\nchange.\nAt the same time, the snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and floating ice in the Arctic Ocean have\ndecreased (as any seasoned skier will tell you), leading to a global sea level rise of between10 cm and25 cm( depending on which set of research findings you believe) over the course of the last century. A similar time-scale is also believed to have seen a one percent\nincrease in global precipitation (although rainfall patterns would seem to have become a lot less predictable along the way).\nSo far so good it all sounds suspiciously like the\nfigures I heard at school but what does it all mean? Well, the latest predictions suggest that average g lo bal temperatures could rise 1-4\u00b0C by 2 1 0 0 (with major regional variations). As a result, soil moisture (ie areas of fertile soil) will diminish whilst rainfall increases, and sea level will rise anything up to two feet on a global scale (local values are much harder to quantify).\nThus, whilst the latest figures are somewhat less\ndramatic than those originally projected (don't expect\nLondon to become submerged or the home counties to\nbecome a desert in our lifetimes) the news certainly\nisn't good. Whilst the scientists and geographers would certainly seem to have been guilty of a degree of\nscare mongering and over-statement and sim pli fic a tion, the general thrust of the argument still holds true\n- left unchecked the Greenhouse Effect will have a very serious impact on the shape of human civilisation.\nSo the question remains, why does no onecare any more?\nThe Solution\nOnce the Western World finally cottoned on to the\nfact that global warming was real (a feat that\ntook an impressively long time and a massive amount of scientific evidence to accomplish) the mission began to pass the buck on to someone else. The first task was to explain that it wasn't actually the West' s problem, and the nineties began with blame being firmly shifted\nonto ailing Russian power plants and fossil fuel bur ning Third World countries (who had usually built their\npower stations with our money...). Indeed, one of the\nmost comical examples of a complete lack of fore thought remains the Aswan Dam project - over the\ncourse of it's thirty year (or so) life-span the rotting\nvegetation left beneath the lake will release about as\nmuch carbon dioxide as burning down most of the\nwoodland in Western Europe. However, whilst it'sea sier to shunt responsibility\non to someone who can't afford to rectify the problem, eventually a share in the blame has to be taken( after\nall the Industrial Revolution was hardly the most environmentally conscious period in British history). Thus\nthe Rio Summit in 1 9 9 2 was called to bring the world's leaders together to attempt to sort out this mess.\nAlthough many of those present used it as a blatant\nopportunity to present their environmentally friendly\nimage, it did produce a very important basis for further\nchange in the shape of the Framework Convention on Climate Change( FCC C). The signatories of the treaty\nall promised to push for anthropogenic( human induced) greenhouse gas emissions to reach \"levels\nthat would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interfere n ce with the climate system\". The FCC C also required that all signatories develop and update national in ven tories of greenhouse gas emissions, so that further output could be closely monitored. This framework has\nsince been modified and further endorsed by continued meetings such as the Kyoto Summit in 1 9 9 7 . How ever, at the same time research into carbon dioxide sinks (ie major areas of forest and vegetation which soak up human based emissions) have created divisions in the scientific community, with leading figures\nsuggesting that the sheer volume of forestry in the US means that their greenhouse gas emissions can practically go unchecked leaving the rest of the world to sort out the mess.\nIn total, therefore, whilst international leaders have\nmade many pretty speeches on the subject, there'san understandable lack of desire to go back to their co un try and actually force factories to close and production methods to alter. Whilst moves have begun to be made in slowing the emission of greenhouse gasses, the total\nproduction rate has thus not altered substantially since\nthe late eighties.\nThe News\nSo what are we left saying? That yes, this crisis is\nreal, and that yes, no government on the planet has\nso far done anything substantial to make a difference.\nAnd, OK, that yes, we certainly don't know enough about the mechanisms of climate change to fully\nexplain or analyse what' s going on but nonetheless\nwe're certainly aware that without some significant\nmovement on the behalf of the world's major powers,\nwe're going to be up a certain creek without a certain\ninstrument...\nSo, to finally get back to the original point, why\nisn't any of this news any more? Having accepted that\npoints two and three are only partly the cause, we have\nto accept that, in a bizarre form of compassion fatigue, we simply don'tc are anymore. We simply forget about a problem once it's stared us in the face once too often, and, in a strange way, we eventually give up and accept our fates simply because we' ve become bored with the issue in hand. Until everything starts to go wrong or a random scientist starts to spout off random theories about an approaching armageddon this is one story that will, quite happily, go away.\nD "
