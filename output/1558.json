    "content": "22 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\neaf Havana\u2019s early\nsingle Friends Like\nThese ends with the\nrepeated line \u201cNothing\ngets worse than growing old\u201d. This show made me realise\nthey\u2019re not wrong (maybe grammati-cally, but, you know\u2026). Surrounded by teenagers having the time of\ntheir young lives, I came to the startling realisation that I am no longer\nyoung. There were people jumping\nup and down, there were people singing along to every word, there were\nyoung couples spooning like their\nlives depended on it. Then there was\nme, stood at the back, tapping my\nfoot along nonchalantly, and drinking a pint of cheap lager like my life\ndepended on it.\nDeaf Havana themselves were\npretty good. They played their ang-sty brand of trying-to-be-heavy pop\npunk (now you may understand the\ndemographic of the gig better\u2026)\nvery well. The older hits, particularly\nLeeches and I\u2019m a Bore, mostly had\nme bobbing my head and smiling,\nand a cover of Friday, I\u2019m in Love (by\nThe Cure) had me singing along with\nthe best of them (in hindsight, this\nprobably made me look older than\nanything else). The tracks o\ufb00 the new\nalbum were generally fairly uninspir-ing. There seemed to be a prevalence\nof the slower, more cringeworthy\ntype of pop punk which left me, well,\ncringing, but the mass sing-alongs\nmade it seem like I was alone on that.\nI do have a few criticisms of the band\nthat aren\u2019t founded mostly in bitter-ness. Firstly, I don\u2019t understand why\nthere are 7 of them live. It just sounds\ncluttered. Secondly, they should play\ntheir breakthrough hit Friends Like\nThese, or at least one track from their\nmore hardcore oriented beginnings.\nThirdly, a long speech about how you\nnever thought you\u2019d make it and you\nlove everybody there for supporting\nyou is clich\u00e9d and just painful to listen to (OK, maybe I\u2019m drifting back\nto bitterness now).\nTo be honest, there wasn\u2019t that\nmuch wrong with Deaf Havana. I am\nthe problem. Everyone seemed really\nexcited as they left the building, so it\nmust have been top notch. However,\nin future, I should just leave the kids\nto it. I did have the last laugh though,\nas (probably) the only person who\nbrought a book, I at least absolutely\nbossed the tube ride home.\nD\nEmiel\u02bcs Guide to Classical Music\nWelcome to the \ufb01rst real\ninstalment of my guide to Classical\nMusic! I hope to start introducing\nthe great composers and some of the\nmasterpieces which address the issues\nraised in my column last week, but\nI feel it\u2019s necessary to describe the\nhistorical and theoretical context from\nwhich \u201cclassical music\u201d arose \ufb01rst. To\nthis end I will start at the beginning,\nor rather, in the middle; for music\nexisted long before the \u201cbeginning\u201d\nand continued its course unperturbed\nfor a long time afterwards. The\nmoment I am referring to is of course\nthe birth of the literate tradition in\nmusic; the earliest point from which\nwe have written music which is still\nperformable today, and the start of a\nrich tradition.\nIn the 7th Century, St. Isidore\nof Seville wrote that \u201cunless sounds\nare held in the memory of man they\nperish, because they cannot be\nwritten down\u201d. Theorists such as\nBoethius or St. Augustine who wrote\nmany centuries earlier still had the\nmost influential ideas about music.\nTo them, music or Musica was a NeoPlatonist idea, which was not actually\nattainable to musicians but which\nonly philosophers could discuss.\nMusica was abstract; a perfect\nmeasurement and division of time\n(rhythm) and harmony (pitches).\nNevertheless \u2013 music\nwas of course being\nperformed and by musicians\ntoo. From the 9th century\na portion of this music\nbegan to be written as an\naid to the memory. As the\nCarolingian monks spread\nthe liturgical Gregorian\nchant through the newly\ncatholic Frankish empire\nthey began to make marks\nabove the text to designate\nvarious musical \u2018shapes\u2019.\nThese were called neumes,\nand initially very little was\nthought of them (there isn\u2019t\na single contemporaneous\nliterary reference!) \u2013 Music\nremained oral and stored in\nthe memory, but eventually\nthey would grow into the\nsophisticated notation system that\nrevolutionised the musical art.\nDepictions of instruments and\nensembles tell us that music played a\nbig role in many aspects medieval life,\nbut unfortunately very little is known\nabout what was actually played. One\nexception is the Gregorian chant\nwhich make up the largest chunk\nof written music surviving from the\nAlbum Review: Deaf Havana\nby Emiel de Lange\nEpisode 2: In the beginning...\n1st millennia. This is a tradition of\nplainchant that became the official\nmusic sung for catholic ceremonies.\nPlainchant basically consists of a\nmale choir singing a monophonic\nline (that is, a line in unison) without\naccompaniment. Different styles\nexisted depending on the type of\nservice and historical evidence\nindicates that the chants were\nperformed differently throughout\ntime, but none of this was recorded.\nHave a listen to some examples on the\nFelix website!\nBy the 11th Century, Guido\nof Arezzo had invented a system\nof staffs which allowed precise\ninformation about the relation\nbetween pitches to be conveyed and\nthe revolution could truly begin. The\nGregorian chants were now written\nand collected into books and a system\nbecame necessary to organise and\nclassify the hundreds of specimens.\nTo develop this system theorists\nonce again looked back to Ancient\nGreece, and speci\ufb01cally the ideas of\nPythagoras.\nLegend has it that the philosopher\nheard the harmonious sound of anvils\nbeing struck and discovered that\nthe most consonant harmonies\n(notes sounding pleasant or stable\ntogether) consisted of simple ratios\nin the size of the instrument. Today\nwe de\ufb01ne a note by a standard\nfrequency, for example middle \u2018A\u2019\nis usually 440 Hz, while another \u2018A\u2019\nwill have a frequency in a 2:1 ratio\nwith 440. The next simplest ratio\nis 3:2 which gives a \u201cperfect \ufb01fth\u201d,\ni.e. \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018E\u2019, and so on. In order\nto classify the chants, theorists\nwould take the \ufb01nal note and\nobserve what pattern of intervals\n(the difference between pitches)\noccurred between it and its \ufb01fth.\nFrom this they developed a system\nof scales called modes from which\nour current system of major and\nminor keys is derived \u2013 but we will\nget to that later!\nThis retheorisation had a\nmassive effect on the writing of\nmusic. Composers could and began\nto use the modes to create \u201ctonally\narticulated formal structures\u201d \u2013\nthe \ufb01rst being Hucbald of St.\nAmand. That is; pieces of music\nstructured around the use of\ndifferent modes to give contrast\nand \ufb01nally resolution. Our modern\nidea of a \u2018piece\u2019 of music was\nbeginning to emerge: an aesthetic\nunit. Before this, music was not\nseen as something autonomous\nwhich existed in its own right,\nbut rather as an activity in which\none participated and which had\nspeci\ufb01c social and religious utility.\nSo the literate revolution\nin music is now well and truly\nunderway! Notation has already\ncatalysed deep changes in the way\nmusic was conceived and used\nand soon the \ufb01rst great musical\nartists came about. In 2 weeks\nwe will explore the works of\narguably the greatest of these early\ncomposers, the Abbess Hildegard\nvon Bingen, but until then please\nvisit www.felixonline.co.uk where\nyou can explore a selection of real\nmusical examples.\nIn other news...\nBritney Spear\u02bcs hits\nOops! I Did It Again and\nHit Me Baby One More\nTime are being used to\nkeep Somali pirates at bay.\nSteven Jones, of the Security Association for the\nMaritime Industry, said:\n\u201cPirates will go to any\nlengths to avoid or try to\novercome the music.\u201d\nReported by The Metro.\nStuart Masson\nMusic Editor\n\n"

    "content": "20 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nImmersed in Fanboy Heaven\nRiaz Agahi reviews Pelican\u02bcs long awaited return\nn my less pretentious\nteenage years I was a big\nfan of all things metal. I\ngradually, however, found\nmyself gravitating away\nfrom the more pedestrian areas of the\ngenre, such as Slayer, who employed\na classic thrash sound that in\ufb02uenced\nmany. It became clear to me that the\ngenre had moved way beyond that\npoint in the intervening 20 years.\nBefore long I found a vast array\nof new sounds, from the insane jazz\ninspired stylings of Behold...The\nArctopus to the more minimal drone\nmetal approach of Sunn O))). To put it\nbluntly, my taste became the subgenre\nI later came to discover was quite\nderisively known as Hipster metal,\na term I would ditch in favour of\n\u2018cerebral metal\u2019 or \u2018intellectual metal,\u2019\nor something equally aggrandising.\nA sizeable chunk of this music was\npost metal such as Isis or Pelican,\nin other words an ecletic genre with\ntinges of post rock, metal, hardcore,\nambient and more.\nAs a hipster metal fan, or metal\nhipster, I often enjoy looking back at\nthe review of the great albums of my\nteens and discovering that they were\nactually quite highly rated on sites\nlike Pitchfork. Isis\u2019 Oceanic is a good\nexample of an album that managed\nto shake o\ufb00 music fans\u2019 studs and\nleather metal stereotype to receive\nsome pretty widespread acclaim\nacross the board. Sadly though, one\nthing me and Pitchfork didn\u2019t see eye\nto eye on was my favourite album of\nall, Pelican\u2019s City Of Echoes.\nI sought out their review not\nlong ago, expecting to see suitably\ngushing praise for an album that\nmanaged to seamlessly move through\nblistering and melodic, a true odyssey\nof instrumental music, where the\nguitar interplay of then guitarist\nLaurent Schroeder-Lebec and Trevor\nde Brauw was so full and incredibly\nevocative that vocals would only have\ncorrupted the sound. Instead, what I\nfound was a rather scathing review\nthat opened with the line \u2018Fire the\ndrummer.\u2019 Allegedly drummer Larry\nHerweg totally ruined the album. So\nI dutifuly relistened in an attempt to\nreconcile my love of the album with\nthis cynically cutting attack. Strangely\nenough, though, my feelings were\nno di\ufb00erent. Tracks like \u2018Far From\nFields\u2019 were still as anthemic and\nmindshatteringly euphoric as ever,\nand while I would argue that the album\nis really all about the aforementioned\nguitar interplay, the rhythm section\nmore than held its own.\nAll of this extensive personal\ncontext may seem super\ufb02uous but\nperfectly explains why it\u2019s interesting\nto me that the very \ufb01rst tone heard\non their new Southern Lord released\nalbum, Forever Becoming, comes from\nthe drums. Album opener \u2018Terminal\u2019\nis all about the drums, in fact, with\na slowly developing beat smashes in\nviolently along with a blast of feedback\nbased dissonance that develops into\nthe guitar. For my money, the track\nis right up there as one of their most\nanthemic and strikingly beautiful\ntracks in their back catalogue. In fact,\ninstead of simply carrying the album\nalong in the background, a job done\nperfectly well in the past, the rhythm\nsection seems to have a much bigger\nrole, more often taking centre stage.\nPerhaps this is explained by all\nthat\u2019s changed with the band, who\u2019ve\nreturned from a four year silence\ninterrupted by last year\u2019s EP Ataraxia/\nTaraxis, an EP that although posessing\nremnants of the classic Pelican sound,\nseemed a little more acousticly\nmotivated and somehow less organic,\nalthough it was still pretty great if I\u2019m\nhonest. Ataraxia/Taraxis proved to be\nthat last output involving founding\nguitarist Schroeder-Lebec. So\nbetween the large time lapse and the\naddition of The Swan King guitarist\nDallas Thomas as a replacement for\nI\nSchroeder-Lebec, I think I wasn\u2019t the\nonly one a bit apprehensive about what\nmight be produced. With \u2018Terminal,\u2019\nhowever, all my concerns immediately\nevaporated and I was lost once again\nin the ethereal world of Pelican\u2019s\nmusic. Going further into the album\nI started to encounter elements of\ntheir previous work, and really it\u2019s the\nsame old Pelican, it would be unfair\nto suggest that they haven\u2019t moved\non and incorporated new ideas but it\nstill consists of the style of ri\ufb03ng and\nguitar leads that I\u2019ve come to admire\nso much.\nMuch like City of Echoes and\n2009\u2019s What We All Come To Need,\nthe band continues to use shorter\ntracks, in the four to eight minute\nrange rather than the 10 minutes plus\nregion that largely prevailed on their\nearlier albums such as their \ufb01rst truly\nclassic album, The Fire In Our Throats\nWill Beckon The Thaw. Tracks like\n\u2018The Tundra\u2019 even evoke memories of\ntheir debut e\ufb00ort, Australasia.\nWhere they\u2019ve changed, though,\nis that the grandiose guitar melodies\nhave lessened in their dominance, with\na much more sparing use augmented\nwith their crunchy ri\ufb03ng as usual and\nthe aforementioned increased role of\nthe rhythm section, or the Herwigs.\nBassist Bryan Herweg, whose tone is\nspot on by the way is the force that\ndrives tracks like \u2018Vestiges,\u2019 and it\u2019s\nhard to argue that this doesn\u2019t add a\nnew depth to the album, with their\nguitar \ufb02ourishes all the more amazing\nand emotive when they do happen.\nA great example of how they\u2019ve\nmoved on is \u2018Threnody,\u2019 a track that\nstarts o\ufb00 like it found its way out of\na Steve Roach album but gives way\nto a particularly gigantic ri\ufb00 that I\u2019m\nsure will be the inspiration of many\nmoshpits to come.\nAlmost 900 words in, it\u2019s pretty\nclear that I\u2019ve avoided naming\nhighlights, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a\ndangerous game when it comes to\nPelican. Their musical complexity\nmeans that at least ten listens are\nneeded to \ufb01nally eradicate moments\nthat may have eluded me during my\nprevious listens.\nTrue to form, though one track\nthat particularly moved me was the\ncloser \u2018Perpetual Dawn,\u2019 perhaps a\ncompanion piece to earlier track\n\u2018Immutable Dusk\u2019 and arguably its\nmirror image. \u2018Immutable Dusk\u2019\nstarts o\ufb00 pretty vicious and slowly\nand melodically decays to a rumbling\nbassline in a hugely Pelican-esque\nmoment as the drums and guitar join\nin and build up in a really emotionally\nresonant way (see: pretty much every\ntrack on City Of Echoes) to a sludgy\nbehemoth, possibly the best ri\ufb00 of the\nalbum.\n\u2018Perpetual Dawn\u2019 does the\nopposite starting o\ufb00 ambient before\nkicking into a less restrained form. At\nten minutes, it\u2019s the albums longest\ntrack, and they use the space created\nby this to really gradually move along,\nwith the heart wrenching journey\nfrom ambient to a stoner-rock like ri\ufb00\nto ambient rumblings complemented\nby acoustic guitars to a hugely\nanthemic ri\ufb00 that\u2019s brought to life\nby a punchy drum line, giving a real\nsense of catharsis until it slowly dies\ndown, replaced once again by acoustic\nguitars as I nearly keel over with the\ndeep wave of melancholy it creates.\nDespite its relative length, I can safely\nsay I felt pretty much every second\nand for me that\u2019s really what Pelican\u2019s\nmusic is about.\nPelican are perfect at the art of\nbalancing amazing technical ability\nwith the creativity to turn that all into\na cohesively structured song.They also\nseem to manage to balance a keen\nsense of experimentalism, within\ntheir genre at least and a mash of great\nri\ufb00 into something truly emotive,\nand by the end of any Pelican release\nI\u2019m always left with a familiar spine-tingling satisfaction along with a sense\nof melancholy that it\u2019s over already, and\nForever Becoming is no di\ufb00erent in that\nrespect.\nI guess the summation of\neverything I\u2019ve said is that after a\nturbulent and controversial few years\nPelican are back, blasting eardrums\nlike the best of them, presenting an\nalbum of evolution rather than all\nout revolution. Pelican will always\nbe Pelican and there\u2019s absolutely\nnothing I can fault with that fact.\nI\u2019m gonna close my review with the\nsimple sentiment \u2013 please keep the\ndrummer.\n\n"

    "content": "11\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 01 NOV\nCOMMENT\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nAn 80km jaunt in Wales\nA\ns most regular runners\nwill testify, there comes\na point when having\nfollowed a routine\nfor a long time, you\nfeel compelled to mix things up and\ntry something new. It\u2019s the runner\u2019s\nmid-life crisis. This seems reasonable\nanalogy for it involves committing to\nsomething rash, a bad idea. For me this\nwas entering the Wye Valley Ultra, an\n80 km race through the mountains of\nmid-Wales. Several months on from\nthe seemly harmless entry form, the\nday came along, bringing with it the\ntask of completing a race just shy\nof two marathons, with over 200m\nof vertical ascent to contend with.\nMy student tendencies eliminated\nthoughts of pre-race nerves when I\nrealised that a 3am alarm was required\nto make the 7.30am start time. Silver\nlinings in everything...\nIn hindsight it was an event in\nfour parts. For the initial 2-3 hours\nI was in race mode. While being a\nnovice at ultra running training had\nprogressed and I wanted to push for\nas good a \ufb01nish as possible. A lot of\nconcentration went into adhering\nto a nutrition programme, which\ninvolved eating approximately 50g\nof carbohydrate and drinking 400mL\nper hour. This I split into roughly half\nhourly \u2018meals\u2019, which dually served\nthe purpose of dividing the overall\ntask with making it easier to \u2018stomach\u2019\nwhile running..\nStage one ended at about 35km when\nI was in a group of three, who were a\nminute down on the leader. Having\nfelt good heretofore, I began to cramp,\ndramatically reducing my speed.\nA gem of Imperial-induced maths\ninformed me that this regression\nhad pushed my \ufb01nish time up from\n8 hours to 10. A depressing thought!\nGiving up wasn\u2019t an option as too\nmany people knew I was racing, thus I\nconvinced myself that ignoring cramp\nwas preferable to inevitable abuse\nI would take if I assigned a \u2018DNF\u2019 to\nmy name. For 90 minutes this struggle\ncontinued; I would be lying if I said\nit fun. Despite this I was con\ufb01dent\nthat my problem was nutrition-based\nthrough muscular-electrolyte de\ufb01cit\nrather than \ufb01tness.\nI reached a point where I could\nspeed up without cramping. At this\npoint I felt I was riding the crest of a\nwave. Feeling that I could run freely\ngave me a lift and the whole venture\nseemed like a better idea than it\nhad beforehand. The miles began to\ntick o\ufb00 faster and with them came\nprogress back up the leader board.\nThe next few hours (I can honestly\nsay) were truly glorious, basking\nin the freedom of running through\nstunning environments, untouched\nand untroubled by the outside world.\nIt was almost spiritual in a way, being\nso completely isolated in my own\nlittle bubble, just letting my mind\nwander whilst I passed lakes, through\nvalleys and over mountains. The one\nissue was the di\ufb03culty of adhering\nto my eating plan. Having been out\nfor over 5 hours, postulating whether\nI was su\ufb03ciently fuelled became\nincreasingly di\ufb03cult.\nThe \ufb01nal stage approached at the\n60km point. By now the euphoria of\nprevious hours had dissipated. For the\n\ufb01rst time I was dealing with the issue\nof muscular fatigue. To put it mildly\nmy legs were \u2018pretty\u2019 sore. The balance\nwas that I was within a distance to the\n\ufb01nish that, barring injury, I would be\nable overcome. I had also raced up the\nleader board. The mental battle was\nforcing myself to push as much as I\ncould in order to \u2018break\u2019 those behind\nme.\nUnlike the opening stages where\nI raced feeling fresh, I was now \u2018redlining\u2019 \u2013 going as fast as I could for\nthe given distance left. This became\na battle between two contrasting\nvoices in my head but I managed\nto hold it together, using a series of\nmental hurdles to focus away from\nthe fatigue. I also thought about the\nprospective outcome and all the\ninput training. Spotting the \u2018200m\nto go\u2019 sign was a relief. Crossing the\nline I did had an immense sense of\nsatisfaction and pride, completing the\nrace in 8 hours 11 minutes and 6th out\nof the 130 starters. It was an enjoyable\nexperience due to the surroundings\nwhere it took place. It provided\ninterest and inspiration, making it a\npleasure (in the main) in which to be\na part. Ultimately, it was an example\nof the value of spending time outdoors\nand protecting those environments.\nCapitalising on the opportunity\nI urge you all to attend the London\nClimate Forum, a sustainability\nconference centred on prospective\nanthropogenic e\ufb00ects. It will be a great\nevent with fantastic speakers. It takes\nplaceatImperialCollegeonNovember\n9th. See londonclimateforum.org for\nmore details.\nT\nhe British Monarchy as\nan institution is, we can\nall agree, quintessentially\nBritish, de\ufb01ned by\npolitical impotence, with\na history of starting needless wars to\nsatisfy stupid demands. A historical\nanachronism allowed to be a part of\nthe elite out of politeness, with the\nmind to its occasional utility. The\nUS needed Britain\u2019s support during\nIraq, to pretend it wasn\u2019t the only\n\u2018democracy\u2019 going to \ufb01ght there\nuh, for democracy, and the British\nGovernment sometimes needs the\nRoyal Family to throw a good party.\nBecause these are times of austerity!\nWait\u2026\nSo, forget the convenient Royal\ndecrees that allow the government to\noverrule Supreme Court judgements,\nused to quash the claims of the\nforcefully displaced Chagos Islanders;\nforget the fact that royalty is a remnant\nof a horribly repressive, backwards\nand cruel historical era. Forget that\nthe royalty own vast tracts of land,\nbought with tax-payers\u2019 money.\nForget that the symbolic e\ufb03cacy of\nthe Royal Family has variously been\nused to support raving nationalism\n(think Yukio Mishima and his\nCultural Emperor, or World War\nJapan generally). The Queen appeared\nin Danny Boyle\u2019s James Bond sketch\nat the Olympics. And sure Charles\nlooks like a horse, but Princess D was\nan angel, wasn\u2019t she? Look at all that\ncharity stu\ufb00 she probably did. And\nthe poor sons, ordinary guys forced\ninto such a hard position, the whole\nworld watching. No wonder they go to\nparties dressed as Nazis, it\u2019s the stress,\npoor things! And then isn\u2019t Kate so\ngood looking and clever, and a normal\nhuman being too. Those Royals can\u2019t\nbe all bad if they marry normal human\nbeings. Plus they bring in tourist\nmoney.\nYou see that last bit is crucial. Most\npeople aren\u2019t willing to support the\nroyal family without some apparent\nutilitarian calculation. They say,\n\u2018No I don\u2019t think we really need a\nmonarchy, but they make us lots of\ntourist money and it would be a pity\nto lose it\u2019. Fair enough, these are times\nof austerity! So okay, keep the Royal\nFamily. I understand that they make\na lot of money for us. I don\u2019t know\nhow anyone calculated exactly how\nmuch tourist money we would lose\nif the Royal Family disappeared, but\neconomists are clever. Take the IMF: if\nunemployment really didn\u2019t exist, their\nmodels would be perfect! Anyway, the\nRoyal family makes Britain money.\nBut, let\u2019s reorganise a bit so we can\nmake more tourist money. These are\ntimes of austerity. A Royal Family\nBig Brother perhaps? A sort of\nBuckingham Palace zoo, where we\ncan see Charles having his Duchy\noriginal blood-of-virgins-or-whatever\njam for breakfast, the Queen on the\ntoilet awnd Prince Phillip being racist\nto the assembled crowds? The Only\nWay is Sandringham House? It sounds\nghastly to me, but then, I never did\nwatch reality TV. At the very least it\nsounds like it will sell.\nJames Ellis\u02bc re\ufb02ections on an ultramarathon\nRoyalties from the Royalty\nMIRROR\n\n"

On a shoestring budget, he\nhas engineered numerous successful\nsummer signings and the Lukaku loan\ndeal was a real coup. Spurs have been\nsolid but not spectacular recently so\nI am backing a repeat of last year\u2019s\nscoreline here. Back Lukaku to feature\non the scoresheet.\nPrediction: 2-1\nArsenal vs Liverpool\n(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)\nO\ufb00ensively, both these sides have\nbeen outstanding so far, as re\ufb02ected\nby their commanding positions\nin the league. However, Liverpool\nare not insurmountable away and\nhave conceded 5 goals in the last 3\nmatches, while Arsenal lost at home\nto Dortmund and looked a little\nvulnerable against Crystal Palace.\nThis should be a fascinating contest\nand I can\u2019t call whether Suarez and\nSturridge or Giroud and Ozil will be\nthe di\ufb00erence.\nPrediction: 1-1\nNewcastle vs Chelsea\n(Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sport 1)\nThe Magpies would probably bene\ufb01t\nfrom lining up defensively against\nChelsea, who have come out on top\nin open, expansive games against\nNorwich and Cardi\ufb00 recently, as well\nas in Europe. But their own strengths\nlie in attack with Remy, Cabaye\nand Ben Arfa so Alan Pardew has a\ndecision to make. In front of 52,000\nGeordies, I expect him to play a high\nline and for Newcastle to be picked o\ufb00\non the break.\nPrediction: 1-2\nBest of the rest\n(Saturday 3pm unless stated)\nFulham vs Man United\nCraven Cottage is not the easiest place\nto go, but David Moyes simply cannot\na\ufb00ord to drop more points here. It is\nin defence that United have mostly\nstruggled, so it\u2019s just as well that their\nCrystal Palace win aside, Fulham\u2019s\nown strikeforce has not really clicked\ninto gear.\nPrediction: 1-2\nHull City vs Sunderland\nThe Tigers have been solid at home all\nseason and Gus Poyet has yet to inject\nthe necessary belief in his players to\nconvince me they can add to their\nsolitary point so far.\nPrediction: 1-0\nMan City vs Norwich\nNorwich had 31 shots against Cardi\ufb00\nand have the necessary guile to cause\nJoe Hart real problems. However, Man\nCity are clearly home bankers and\nrightly so \u2013 no team in the Premier\nLeague possesses a more potent attack\nINSIDE\nDevils riding bikes in Hyde Park Duathlon\nif things ever get hairy.\nPrediction: 3-1\nStoke vs Southampton\nSaints have a fantastic core of Lovren,\nFonte, Schneiderlin and Wanyama,\nwhich allows them to play a pressing\ngame to great e\ufb00ect, especially away.\nThe Potters showed uncharacteristic\n\ufb02air at Old Tra\ufb00ord but the Britannia\nis no longer the fortress it once was.\nPrediction: 0-1\nWest Brom vs Crystal Palace\nAlthough Palace showed signs\nof character and commitment\nagainst Arsenal, they still look like\na Championship side. Luis Suarez\ndisposed of West Brom last time\nout but the Baggies are a powerful,\nattacking side and should have far too\nmuch.\nPrediction: 2-0\nWest Ham vs Aston Villa\nWest Ham have already lost 3 home\nmatches this season and are hard\nto back with so few \ufb01t strikers.\nVilla perform better away and have\nChristian Benteke to break down\nthe Hammers defence.

O\ufb00\nthe back of a 24-0 win against their\ninferior university colleagues, IC were\nbrimming with con\ufb01dence going into\nthis game with a very strong team on\npaper, only missing centre Mike Floyd\n(su\ufb00ering from a bruised shoulder),\nand albino winger Fred White (busy\nscouting next year\u2019s fresher intake\nwhilst modelling vests in Korea).\nIn the \ufb01rst half Imperial were\nplaying against the elements, having\nto stick to a very reserved and mature\ngame plan to prevent Brighton from\nutilising the conditions. Brighton did\napply pressure, but were let down\nby poor discipline which allowed IC\nto work their way into the Brighton\nhalf. Following a strong maul from\nthe forwards, led well by Irish skipper\nMickey O\u2019Connell (from the Gaelic\n\u2018\u00d3 Conaill\u2019 meaning \u201cbravery of the\nwolf\u201d), Brighton gave away another\npenalty allowing James Cox to put\nthe \ufb01rst 3 points on the board with a\ntough kick.\nFor the majority of the \ufb01rst half\nImperial defended well, with big hits\nand strong rucking from all members\nof the team. As Imperial easily\nabsorbed the visitor\u2019s pressure it was\nBrighton who made the \ufb01rst mistake.\nCox grabbed another 3 points from\nthe tee. The \ufb01rst half ended at a strong\n6-0, Imperial happy with their position\nconsidering the conditions.\nThe second half kicked o\ufb00 with\nIC keen to make use of the great\nwinds at Harlington, and that they\ndid. Halfbacks Fraser and Cox kept\nBrighton pinned down, and strong\nchases from both wingers (Freshers\nJohn \u2018the man\u2019 Mann and Tom\n\u2018catch me if you can\u2019 Catchpole) gave\nBrighton\u2019sback3littlechancetoreturn\nkicks. Following a blatant breach of\nrucking rules, Imperial 1st XV was\nawarded another penalty, which Cox\nput between the uprights. Forced\nonto the back foot, Brighton su\ufb00ered\na constant barrage of strong runs from\nboth IC centres, Jack Flanagan and\nFresher Joe. It was Jack who was \ufb01rst\nto break through the back line, opting\nto run through rather than round the\nBrighton full back before slogging\nhis way over the line with half of the\nBrighton team hanging on. Cox added\nthe extras.\nImperial continued to dominate as\nboth wingers came up just short of the\nline, driven on by the loud cheers from\nthe cider fuelled 3rd XV, spectators\nafter a late cancellation to their \ufb01xture.\nThe pack grafted all over the pitch,\nTom \u2018little Lion Man\u2019 Hedley and\nFresher \u2018Vinegar Dave\u2019 both making\nlarge contributions to the tackle\ncount. The ferocious hits got the\nbetter of the timid pier-dwellers, and\nwith shaking hands Brighton dropped\nthe egg, (Lesson 1: Don\u2019t drop the\negg!). Cox seized the opportunity and\nran in for another 5 points. Normality\nwas \ufb01nally restored as his conversion\nwent nowhere near the posts to keep\nthe score 21-0.\nWith the clock running out Imperial\ngave a last push and ground their way\nto within 10 metres of the Brighton\nline. With pressure telling the referee\nawarded a \ufb01nal penalty in the last\nplay of the game which duly sailed\nhome to leave the score line at 24-0.\nCongratulations to the 1st XV for a\nmature and organised game and a\nsolid victory.\nICURFC\n\n"

A sea of\ncolours, thoughts, noises. The\nnew \ufb01lm adverts. The delays\nannouncements. The sound of a tube\npulling into the platform and your\ndesperate wish to get onto it.\nThis is what the TFL posters have\nto compete with \u2013 and Tube150 is all\nabout how it\u2019s achieved.\nThe exhibition is a collection of\nLondon Underground posters- the\ntype they put up to tell you that an\nupgrade is underway, or a new station\nis opening. Moving through the rooms\nof the exhibition is a journey through\nthe tube\u2019s history, an education in\ngraphic arts and a recap of London\u2019s\nmain events from the last century. The\noldest poster is from 1866, the \ufb01rst year\nof the District line, and compares the\ncheap fares of the line in comparison to\nthe rival line, the Metropolitan.\nThe core of the exhibition is in the\nfantastic art deco posters of the 30s,\nyears in which the tube boom was\nin full swing. The various competing\nunderground companies were uni\ufb01ed\nin the early 30s, and the underground\nstarted commissioning hundreds of\nposters from top artists advertising\nvarious locations reachable by tube.\nThe vibrant colours and elegant\nlettering hark back to an age in which\ntube travel was intensely fashionable,\nthe real symbol of a busy, a\ufb04uent and\nglamorous capital.\nThe 40s posters are slightly more\nsedate and show the shift in British\nculture that the Second World War\ncaused. Suddenly the focus is on\ntechnological advances, with black and\nwhite photo montages boasting the\nnew safety features and improvements\n(1937 saw the \ufb01rst pneumatic doors on\ntubes). There is also new emphasis on\nthe equality of the tube- we no longer\nsee fur-coated \ufb02appers and top hatted\ndandies, but factory workers sitting\nnext to business men. First class tickets\nhad been abolished in 1939, and TFL\nshows how anyone can now pay the\ncheap ticket to get about with comfort,\nspeed and reliability.\nOne poster, from 1944, shows the\ncityscape and a tube station with a\npatriotic paragraph underneath \u2013 so\nfar, nothing remarkable. The same\nposter however was printed in di\ufb00erent\nlanguages and put up across the globe\nwhere British troops were stationed, to\nencourage them on, and remind them\nof their \u201cProud City\u201d\n.\nAfter the 50s, tube posters went\nthrough a bit of a boring phase, with\nposter commissions being given to\nC\nherry blossom, silhouettes,\ngolden fans and blood.\nBetrayal, loneliness,\ndishonour and regret.\nA young geisha, a crass\nAmerican Navy Lieutenant and their\nyoung son. Puccini\u2019s Madam Butter\ufb02y\nis set against the late 19th century\nobsession with Japan, an elusive\nworld of decadent elegance, where\nbeautiful 15 year olds can be bought\nwith the same ease and propriety as\nvillas with sea views.\nThe opera starts with Lieutenant\nPinkerton at his new villa on\nNagasaki, preparing to receive Cio\nCio San, the rashamen he has chosen.\nRashamen were women that could\nbe married on a monthly renewable\ncontract by Westerners docked at\nNagasaki or Yokohoma, and their\nrole in Japanese port life was that of\nsanctioned sex-worker.\nHere the story diverges from\nhistorical facts, as an opera where\na naval o\ufb03cer takes a prostitute for\na few months would not be up to\nmuch. The stu\ufb00 of opera is emotions\nand feelings, and sure enough it\nturns out that young Cio Cio San\nis unaccountably besotted with\nPinkerton, and sees her marriage as\nthe end of her geisha work and the\nstart of a new American life with him.\nIt was at this point in the opera that\nmy \ufb01rst surprise came. Cio Cio San\n(meaning Madam Butter\ufb02y) is usually\nshown like most tragic heroines \u2013\nvulnerable but alluring. In this ENO\nproduction she is far from a femme\nfatale \u2013 shy, cringing, scuttling about,\nshe desires Pinkerton but is too shy\nand in awe of him to allow herself to\nbe touched.\nThough this sits oddly with her\ngeisha past, it makes her a very real\ncharacter, as she persuasively displays\nall the awkwardness of a young\nteenager. Pinkerton on the other hand\nwas overly unpleasant, and because of\nthis never actually emerges as a truly\nrelatable character. He\u2019s shallow, he\ncan\u2019t wait to get back to America and\nmarry a \u201cproper woman\u201d, and all he\nwants is a bit of fun whilst he remains\nstationed in Japan. By the time the\n\ufb01rst act \ufb01nishes it is clear that Cio\nCio is a deluded, sheltered young girl\nwho sees laddish Pinkerton as a hero\ncoming to save her from her life as a\nsex-worker.\nWhat makes this production\nso special is its aesthetic quality\n\u2013 the visual richness it maintains\nthroughout is a modern look at\n1900s Japanophilia: rich reds and\ngolds, elegant silhouettes behind\npaper screens and a huge metallic\nceiling and \ufb02oor, mirroring the\nopulent costumes. Throughout the\nproduction, the stage is also \ufb01lled\nwith black veiled \ufb01gures, who move\nthe props around the stage, visible\nbut strangely unseen. Because of their\nveiled faces and identical clothes,\nthey blend into the background \u2013\nthey appear not as people but almost\nas spirits.\nIn the second act, as Cio Cio is\nwaiting for Pinkerton\u2019s return, they\nforeshadow her tragic death using\ncoloured veils and puppets, spiralling\naround her as she dozes. They are also\nthe puppeteers of her child (the only\ncharacter to be played by a puppet\nand not a person), reminiscent of the\ntraditional Japanese puppet theatre\nBunraku. This is very di\ufb00erent to\nEuropean Punch and Judy type\npuppets \u2013 the puppets are stylised\nbut life-sized, and are moved by\nthree puppeteers, making for an\nunsettlingly human-like movement.\nIn the \ufb01nal act, when Cio Cio takes\nher own life, two of these black\n\ufb01gures come out and unfold her\nwedding belt, which stretches out\ninto two long red veils, leaving her in\na dramatic river of blood.\nThey are disquieting, unusual,\nand intensely oriental, capturing\nthe essence of this production \u2013 the\npuzzled, coarse Western love for the\nEast.\nadvertising companies rather than\nartists. A few notable exceptions are a\npsychedelic 60s and a raving 80s poster,\nadvertising London nightlife.\nThe collection is wonderful. Vibrant,\ninteresting, funny, it really sums up\n150 years of history seen through\nthe perspective of the most iconic\ntransport system in the world. It is\ntherefore a mystery to me why the\nLondon Transport museum has\ncrowded it all into two thin rooms,\nwith tiny little plaster board corridors\nblocking o\ufb00 one area from the other.\nThe whole point of the exhibition is\nhow versatile, captivating and striking\nthese artworks are \u2013 they needed to\nbe displayed a huge space, not a few\nwhite-washed broom cupboards.\nDespite the limited exhibition space,\nTube150 is a must for any user of public\ntransport in London, and will make\nyou step in to the tube home with a\nwhole di\ufb00erent world in mind.

Everything is arranged to be\ntouched, to be rummaged through. It\nplaces the viewer in the role of voyeur,\npassing uninvited through the house\nof Norman Swann, an aging, failed\narchitect.\nVenture in, and you will \ufb01nd\nyourself in suspended animation,\ntransported into a \ufb02at that could\nbelong behind any of the closed doors\nin South Kensington. The entrance\nhall is austere, dimly lit, and richly\ndecorated, yet looks lived-in. There\nare brown shoes lined up by the\ndoorway; a yellow post-it note on the\nornate mirror demands the electricity\nbill be paid.\nA doorway leads to a large living\nroom, decorated with an odd mix of\ninherited antiques and rather more\nmodern fare. A crude plaster statue of\na giant head stands guard to a wall-to-wall bookcase, \ufb01lled with red leather-bound books and vases and \ufb01gurines\nthat could be worth quite a bit. But\nthe plaster is moulding where the\nwater pipe has leaked, there are cold\nashes from a cigar in the ash tray, and\ncongealing co\ufb00ee at the bottom of a\ncup, abandoned on the table. There is\na musty feel to these rooms, a seeping\nsense of neglect, of a house haunted\nby its once grand past. A small boy\nin a school uniform cowers in the\n\ufb01replace. Could he be a resident? A\nhuge painting of the same child hangs\njust above; a memory then, perhaps a\nghost.\nPast a closed door behind which\na shower is perpetually running,\nthe grand rooms give way to a badly\nre\ufb01tted modern kitchen. Domino\u2019s\npizza boxes are piled up in a corner,\nand packing boxes \ufb01lled with\npaintings and antiques occupy much\nof the room. Half-\ufb01nished cardboard\nmodels of tower blocks and modern\nbuildings balance precariously around\nthe adjoining study. A bowl is stu\ufb00ed\nwith room service bills from a New\nLUIS JAVIER SANDOVAL\nTurtle taking a sel\ufb01e. Casual.\nN\now in its 49th year, the\nWildlife Photographer\nof the Year exhibition\nhas recently returned\nto its original habitat the Natural\nHistory Museum. It showcases 100\nphotographs of the world around us\nthat most will hardly ever get an actual\nglimpse of.\nFirst time visitors should prepared\nto be surprised, amazed, and\nextremely moved by the forces of\nnature on display. Third or fourth\ntime visitors however \u2013 although\nthe quality of photographs has not\ndeclined compared to previous years\n\u2013will probably not be able to help but\ncompare the 2013 images to former\nfavourites, and past themes.\nWhat everyone should expect\nthough are massive crowds on\nweekends, breathing down your neck\nas you struggle on tiptoe to view the\npictures. Take advantage of being a\nstudent and go on a free period.\nThe uno\ufb03cial \u2018most popular animal\u2019\ncrown has been taken from last year\u2019s\npolar bear (which surprisingly only\nfeatures in one photo this year) and\nhas instead been given to the dugong,\nwhich is celebrated in no fewer than\nthree images by Douglas Seifert.\nBut rather than being repetitive and\ntedious, each image exposes a slightly\ndi\ufb00erent side to the sweet thing.\nThe \ufb01rst of these images at \ufb01rst\nseems odd, full of swimmers that\nshould not feature, only for the viewer\nto realise that they in fact demonstrate\nthe human threat we cannot seem to\nhelp but burden onto everything we\ntouch. The divers appear to physically\nloom over the creature, blocking out\nthe beautiful sunlight shining onto it.\nThe second image is a cheeky dugong\ncreating pressure waves for two tiny\nyellow \ufb01sh to ride along in front of it.\nThe third dugong in Seifert\u2019s trilogy is\na cute hoover, sucking up sea-grass on\na shallow bay.\nSuch images are perfect examples of\nhow every piece in the exhibit to tell\nits own magni\ufb01cent story, and no two\nare ever the same. They are so well\ncaptioned that viewers can\u2019t help but\nstop and read about every last detail,\nfrom how the photographer took\nthe shot to the judges\u2019 opinion and\nthe biological description of what it\nrepresents.\nOther favourites I personally like\nto spot are the \u201cI had to lie in the\nsnow / underwater / in the wind and\nrain for ten hours until suddenly X\nanimal popped out and by chance I\nmanaged to take this amazing shot\u201d\nexplanations. Other mainstays of the\nexhibition include cacti under the\ndesert stars, the Northern Lights,\nan uncomfortable polar bear (the\nquintessential symbol of climate\nchange), the wise old monkey, the\n\ufb01ghting animal pair, and the black and\nwhite \ufb02ock of birds always exploited in\nthe shop on some gift wrap.\nIt is also fun to annually complain\nvery loudly that the judges obviously\npicked the wrong winner, and that this\ncommended photograph should have\nwon not that atrocious unoriginal\npiece (which is usually by no means\nactually atrocious).\nPerhaps it is not so fun to see the age\n17 and under section, and realise you\nare only just avoiding being a waste of\nspace, whilst marvelling at the work of\nphotographers sometimes half your\nage or younger. Some in this section\nare even more impressive than the\nadult entries. A personal favourite\nfrom 10 years and under includes\nPeacock at Sunrise by Louis Pattyn.\nA \ufb01nal note for the trypophobics\namong you \u2013 be ready to avert your\neyes, as repeating patterns such\nas reptilian and amphibian scales,\nor \ufb02ocks of birds from afar, are\ncommonplace in the exhibition.

Any food.\nObviously that all went horribly\nRevenge of the leftovers\nwrong (and yet so hilariously right),\nand the sequel picks up where the first\nfilm left off: Swallow Falls (Lockwood\u2019s\nhome island) is covered in enormous\nleftovers, and the entire population is\nto be relocated. So far, so predictable.\nThe main antagonist (in the shape of\na thinly-veiled mockery of Apple and\nthe late, great Steve Jobs) is intro-duced, Flint goes to work for them,\nblah, blah, blah. Of course, once the\nold gang return to the island, things\nget considerably more interesting\u2026\nI admit, that really doesn\u2019t do the\nopening 20 or so minutes justice. Despite operating on a fairly flimsy plot\n(which works for a kids\u2019 film, so I\u2019m\nnot convinced there\u2019s much point in\ncomplaining), the film kicks off by\ngenerating consistent laughter, be it\nCloudy with a\nChance of Meatballs\n2\nDirectors: Cody Cameron, Kris Pearn\nWriters: Judi Barrett, Ron Barrett,\nJohn Francis Daley, Jonathan M.\nGoldstein, Phil Lord, Chris Miller,\nErica Rivinoja\nStarring: (voices) Bill Hader, Anna\nFaris, James Caan, Will Forte, Andy\nSamberg, Benjamin Bratt, Neil\nPatrick Harris\nRuntime: 107 minutes\nCertificate: U\nJack Steadman\nWriter\nFred Fyles\nStar Writer\nWhat a difference a decade can make.\nJust 10 years ago, director Asghar\nFarhadi had yet to release his first film,\nbut today he is one of the hottest contemporary Iranian directors around.\nEvery film he has created has won\nrafts of awards at various festivals; his\nlast film A Separation, won critical acclaim across the board, and beat off\nstiff competition to win the Academy\nAward for Best Foreign Language Film\nin 2011. He is now back again, with a\nfilm that explores the hidden drama\nwithin everyday lives.\nThe Past is like a box of forgotten\nlove letters, a series of scenes that\nbring back happy memories, but also\nopen old wounds. Berenice Bejo,\nwhose breakout role as Peppy Miller\nin the silent film The Artist merited\na nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and Ali Mosaffa star as a married couple going through a divorce.\nHaving been separated for four years,\nAhmad (Mosaffa) returns to Paris\nfrom Iran to finalise the legal divorce\nfrom his soon-to-be ex-wife Marie\n(Bejo); upon arrival he finds that Marie has not booked a hotel for him, and\ninstead he must stay with her, her two\ndaughters from a previous marriage,\nand Fouad, a young boy who is the son\nof Marie\u2019s current beau Samir, played\nby Tahar Ramin - best known for his\nrole in the 2009 film Un Prophete. We\nsoon find out that Samir is still mar-ried, but his wife is in a coma following a suicide attempt, and has been for\nthe past year or so.\nThis complicated web of relationships is put under strain, both from\nAhmad\u2019s visit, and the dark secret Marie\u2019s daughter Lucie has been hiding;\nas the film progresses relations break\ndown, and the family is brought to\nbreaking point. While Ahmad is annoyed at having to endure exposure\nto both Samir, and his son, the married couple relationship that begins to\nre-emerge between Ahmad and Marie throughout the film makes Samir\nfeel like a stranger in the house; there\nis one particularly brilliant scene in\nwhich he is mistaken by a delivery\nman for a handyman, at the house for\na job, and is left standing bewildered\nin the garden\nBejo is stunning as Marie; both sympathetic and maleficent, she cuts a\nemotional but brittle figure. Eagre to\nanger her husband, she forces him to\nendure the presence of her new boy-friend, and just before they finalise the\ndivorce tells him that she is pregnant.\nThese actions are what begin to drive\nthe family apart, yet the motives driving Marie remain understandable,\nand the audience can easily empathise\nwith her. She is a woman on the edge,\ntaking to chain smoking as things\nbegin to pile up on top of her. Bejo\nmanages this multi-faceted role with\nnuance and ease, giving up a wonderfully visceral performance that makes\nit unsurprising that she picked up the\nBest Actress award at Cannes. Ali\nMosaffa\u2019s restrained, almost impassive\npresence becomes a rock upon which\nthe relationships rest, making the end\nscenes, in which he is at his most en-by sight gags, general slapstick, recurring jokes or (most importantly)\nsimultaneously awful/hilarious puns.\nOh, the food puns. Once the action\nmoves onto the island, things only get\npunnier, with the ridiculously oversized array of the things dreamt up by\nthe writers and designers coming into\nfull force. There are some fairly obvious (but still beautiful) cutaway gags\nthat accompany lines such as \u201cthere\u2019s\na leek in the boat!\u201d (it\u2019s in the trailer,\nI\u2019ve spoilt nothing here), but the sheer\nquantity on display here means laughter is guaranteed frequently throughout the film.\nThe voice-acting is pretty much\nspot-on, although the replacement of\nMr T with Terry Crews as Earl jars\nslightly if you were a fan of the original,\nand Chester V (Will Forte) is such an\nincredibly irritating antagonist you\u2019d\nalmost rather the film just focused on\nthe food animals and ignored the plot\nentirely. Which, to be fair, does happen for a significant chunk of its running time.\nThe animation itself is beautiful,\nand the designs are near-faultless, although the 3D (of course it\u2019s in 3D,\nwhat did you expect?) is almost a complete and utter waste, adding nothing\nto the film other than a little extra\ndepth in some shots.\nComing it at 95 minutes, Cloudy\nnever manages to out-stay its wel-come, and although it\u2019s never quite\nas original as its predecessor it\u2019s still a\ngreat deal better than many of its peers\n(it\u2019s certainly more endearing than\nPixar\u2019s recent output, which is a sentence I never expected to type), and\nit\u2019s certainly worth a watch, whether\nyou\u2019re a five-year-old or a fifth-year\nstudent. Just don\u2019t go in expecting any\nreal take-home messages other than\nmore food puns than you can possibly\nremember.\nraged, all the more shocking.\nLike A Separation, The Past is a film\nthat deals with the baggage that relationships can bring - particularly how\nthey end. The film carries the air of an\nepic tragedy about it, and the audience\ncan foresee the storm clouds looming\non the horizon, but it never feels bleak.\nUnder Farhadi\u2019s direction, the film is a\ngrown-up, serious dissection of rela-tionships; despite some moments that\nthreaten to spill over into melodrama,\nThe Past is definitely one to watch for\nthis year\u2019s Academy Awards.\n\n"

    "content": "9\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 01 NOV\nSCIENCE\nLaurence Pope on recent research into the humble honeybee\nThe chaos of colony collapse disorder\nCSIRO AUSTRALIA\nT\nhe modern-day bee is in\na bit of a sticky situation,\nand we\u2019re not talking about\nhoney.\nIt was published in\nPLoS One last week that scientists\ndiscovered a mass-extinction of one\nbee group, Xylocopinae, at around\nthe same time the dinosaurs punched\nout of the biological timeline. This\nextinction is believed to be linked to\nthe extinction of many \ufb02owering plant\nspecies. Speed forward 65 million\nyears or so and we\u2019ve got another bee\nproblem: colony collapse disorder\n(CCD).\nYou could write a dissertation on\ncolony collapse disorder (and indeed\nI actually have), but it can be boiled\ndown to a few simple facts. Back in late\n2006 US beekeepers noticed that their\nhives were devoid of large numbers\nof worker bees, even dead ones. The\nbees had seemingly vanished. Over\nsix years on and it\u2019s still a problem\nacross a lot of the world, including\nthe US, Europe and parts of Asia. Bee\npopulations are crashing, and noone\u2019s quite sure why.\nSeveral competing hypotheses\nhave been put forward. Some blame\na group of pesticides known as\nneonicotinoids, a class of neuroactive\nagents introduced in the early 1990s.\nNeonicotinoids have low toxicity in\nmammals, and at the time seemed\na good alternative to more toxic\npesticides being used. And although\nthey\u2019re quite good at killing pests\nthey\u2019re apparently also quite good\nat disrupting the bee\u2019s in-built\nnavigation system. The EU recently\nimposed a ban, although the jury\u2019s still\nout amongst scientists whether or not\nneonicotinoids are a major culprit in\nCCD.\nOther blame the aptly named\nVarroa destructor, a parasitic mite\nthat attaches to bees and inadvertently\nspreads viruses to its host, weakening\nthe bee\u2019s immune system. Even\nmore factors have been brought into\nquestion, including the monoculture\nnature of farming, climate change,\nother pathogens and malnutrition.\nNo single factor has been conclusively\nsingled out as the major causative\nagent of CCD, but like many complex\necological phenomena CCD is likely\nthe outcome of a mixture of these\nissues. There will be no silver bullet.\nThe consequences of CCD extend\nfar beyond a potential shortage\nof honey and pretty \ufb02owers. Bees\ncontribute billions to the economy\nvia their ability to pollinate crops.\nWithout them the pollination of many\ncrops would need to occur by hand,\nan expensive and time-consuming\nprocess that would very likely impact\noverall crop yield.\nAnd so research continues. For the\nsake of both the human race and the\nbeleaguered bee one hopes solutions\nwill soon be found.\nDOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0076683\nCCD has destroyed over 10 million honeybee hives and caused over US$2million in damage\nM\noney doesn\u2019t grow\non trees, said every\nperson ever, but it\nturns out that isn\u2019t\nentirely accurate.\nThere\u2019s gold in them thar hills, or\nrather, in them thar trees. Scientists\nhave struck gold \u2013 surprisingly in the\nleaves, twigs and bark of eucalyptus\ntrees in Western Australia.\nA group of researchers from the\nCommonwealth Scienti\ufb01c and\nIndustrial Research Organisation\n(CSIRO) made the discovery recently\nand published their \ufb01ndings in the\njournal Nature Communications.\nThey say that the roots of the trees\nact like a \u2018hydraulic pump\u2019, taking up\ntiny ions of gold tens of metres within\nthe soil below as they gather water.\nParticularly in drought conditions\nroots can reach up to 35 metres deep\ninto the soil.\nThe gold is transported up\nthrough the tree by the vasculature\nsystem, replacing water lost through\ntranspiration. Most likely toxic to\nthe plant, the gold is then moved to\nleaves and branches in order to reduce\ndeleterious biochemical reactions.\nThese can eventually be shed, thereby\nremoving the gold.\nGoing to Australia to chop down\ntrees that you can then trade to a\ncash-for-gold website when your\nstudent loan runs out isn\u2019t a feasible\nway to make a quick buck however.\nThe amount of gold particles found\nin the trees is miniscule. Dr Melvyn\nLintern, one of the geochemists who\nauthored the paper, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve done\na calculation, and found that we need\n500 trees growing over a gold deposit\nto have enough gold in the trees\nthemselves to make a gold ring.\u201d\nThescientistsusedtheMaiadetector\nfor x-ray elemental imagining at the\nAustralian synchrotron to visualise the\nparticulate gold. \u201cThis is a \ufb01rst,\u201d said\nDr Lintern. \u201cWe know that gold occurs\nin leaves but this is the very \ufb01rst time\nthat gold has been found as a visible\nparticle in any biological material, let\nalone leaves. Any biological material\nat all.\u201d A Eureka! moment indeed.\nLet\u2019s note though that this research\nwill not prompt an old-school gold\nrush. The nuggets of gold are one\ufb01fth of the diameter of a human\nhair \u2013 genuinely invisible to other\nequipment. But this could herald the\nbeginning of a golden era for mineral\nprospecting. Nowadays most easy-access gold deposits have been found\nall around the world. Deposits are\nnow detected by exploratory drilling,\nor by \ufb01nding a location where gold\nore appears on the Earth\u2019s surface.\nAnalysing vegetation above ground\nand discovering gold could indicate\nburied treasure tens of metres below.\n\u201cNot only do we believe it is a way\nof stretching the exploration dollar\nfurther,\u201d said Dr Lintern, \u201cbecause\nexploring for these deposits can be\nquite expensive, it also minimises the\ndamage to the environment because\nwe are taking a very small sample\nfrom the trees themselves, as well as\nthe leaves and twigs on the ground.\n\u201cThe leaves could be used in\ncombinationwithothertoolsasamore\ncost e\ufb00ective and environmentally\nfriendly exploration technique,\u201d\nSuch a method would go some way\ntowards addressing the problems of\ndeclining supply and quality alongside\nincreasing demand for gold. There is\nalso the possibility that the technique\ncould be adapted to identify other\nmineral deposits, such as zinc and\ncopper.\nDOI: 10.1038/ncomms3614\nApparently money does grow on trees\nMODERN FARMER\nParticulate gold in eucalyptus leaves\nFiona Hartley finds it difficult to ignore a golden opportunity for puns\n\n"

For those of\nyou who don\u2019t know what this is, the\nHumble Bundle is a sale in which\na set of games are available for\nwhatever price you choose. It started\noff as an indie game only bundle, but\nsince then it has expanded and even\nTHQ has gotten in on it (though\nthey placed more limitations than\nother groups have previously done).\nGame: Anodyne\nA retro-style RPG\nIn Anodyne, you play as Young. Young\u2019s\nquest is to \u2018protect the Briar from\nthe Darkness\u2019 \u2013 this wasn\u2019t explained\nany further from what I have played.\nYou are teleported to some strange\nplace where you \ufb01nd your weapon \u2013 a\nbroom. It can pick up dust and put it\ndown in other places. The art style is\nquite cool, the music is very well done,\nbut overall this game didn\u2019t really grab\nme. The premise is not that interesting,\nthough the puzzles can be. If you enjoy\nthis sort of game it might keep you\nentertained for a few hours, but the\nhalf hour I\u2019ve put into it is enough to\ntell me that it\u2019s just not that interesting.\nGame:\nGreed Corp.\nA strange twist on traditional\nstrategy games\nGreed Corp is one of the most\ninteresting strategy games I\u2019ve come\nacross. Unlike most strategy games,\nwhere you get stronger as time goes on,\nin Greed Corp your position becomes\nmore precarious as time goes on. The\nentire game is based around a unit\ncalled a harvester, which is the main\nway to earn money to buy units with.\nThe other methods are the beginning\nof turn and knockout bonuses. The\nGame: Incredipede\nA combo puzzle-platformer\nGame: Ticket to\nRide Online\nA popular board game in computer\nform\nQuozzle is an incredipede \u2013 a strange\ncreature with the ability to change\nshapes. Her sisters were kidnapped\nand she wants to save them, or some-thing. The story of Incredipede is\nfairly boring and standard. The real\nfun in Incredipede comes in building\nIf you\u2019ve ever played the Ticket\nto Ride board game, you already\nknow whether or not this is worth\nit for you. See the end of the review\nfor details of what this includes.\nFor those who have not played be-fore, Ticket to Ride is a very popular board game which was originally\nmade in 2004 by Days of Wonder.\nTicket to Ride is a simple game to play\n\u2013 each turn you can collect cards, take\nnew tickets, or build train routes. You\nneed cards to build routes, and tickets\ngive you points for connecting certain\ncities, or take them away if you fail\nto connect those cities. It is a game\nof ruthless expansion and blocking\nothers to help you achieve your own\ngoals. The original USA map awards a\nbonus for the longest connected route\nand whilst this is the standard, other\nmaps sometimes change this bonus.\nThe art is perfect, re\ufb02ecting the board\ngame very well, though the music takes\na little getting used to. I didn\u2019t enjoy\nthe music at all to begin with, but having played for a week I now adore it.\nOnlineplayisveryeasy,whichisimportant as the AI is not particularly good!\nThis version of the game comes with\nthe USA map and the 1910 expansion (which adds a bonus for most\ncompleted tickets, and a new set of\ntickets). The other maps available\n(Switzerland, Asia, Europe) can be\nbought for between \u00a32.50 and \u00a33.10.\nWhether you are the head of board\ngames at Imperial (totally not me), an\na\ufb01cionado, someone who plays from\ntime to time, or have never played\nboard games beyond the dreaded Monopoly, this is a great game to pick up.\nproblem is, the harvesters destroy the\nland (literally!) in order to earn you\nthat money, so it doesn\u2019t take too long\nbefore there\u2019s barely any land left on\nthe map. The rest is just empty space.\nUnfortunately, most games end up\nwith a race to get enough money to\nbuy a \ufb02yer (the only way to cross the\nvoid), with the winner being decided\nby the \ufb01rst person to \ufb02y over to their\nopponents territory. So late strategy is\nsliminthisgame,buttheearlystrategy,\nmusic and graphics make this a winner.\nEven if you\u2019re not a massive fan of turn\nbased strategy games, this is worth a\nfew plays \u2013 especially with friends.\nyour own creature and then unleashing her on the platformer-style levels\nto try and collect all the fruits (why\nshe needs fruits, I don't know). In easy\nmode, all of the creatures are pre-built\nand you only need to use them cor-rectly. However in hard mode, nearly\nall levels require you to build bits of\nQuozzle for yourself, which is very\ndi\ufb03cult to do correctly! You can add\n'legs' and muscles to Quozzle, and\nthat's about it. It can be incredibly dif\ufb01cult to predict how the legs will move\ndue to the way the muscles work \u2013 you\nreally need to see this to understand.\nThe interesting mechanics combined\nwith the \ufb01tting music and charming\ngraphics (though the exposed bones\nand muscles are rather creepy) make\nthis a great game for any puzzle lovers.\nA Summer at Gunpoint\nLets turn the clock back to the end\nof the summer term, 2013. The days\nwere long and hard, but then the\nterm ended, and all was well. And\nsuddenly I found myself with much\nmore time for gaming. This in turn\nallowed me to \ufb01nally catch up with\na game I had been anticipating for a\nyear, Gunpoint.

The music and art bring\nthe game to life, as you jump across\nbuildings, up and down lifts and\ntinker with the wiring that even\nwith the short playing time (about 4\nhours total) it was worth every mo-ment, seeing the result of the game\nmaker\u2019s e\ufb00orts as well as inspiring me to begin creating my own.\nsensitive data and technology from\nvarious people, for various reasons.\nHitting both the platformer and\nstealthgenres,Gunpointthrowssome-thing else into the mix: The ability to\nrewire all the electronics in the building in interesting ways, which brings a\ngreat puzzle element to this adventure.\nI\u2019d been anticipating it for so long\nbecause it started as a project by\nPC Gamer writer Tom Francis, who\nwanted to learn to develop games\nwith absolutely no prior knowledge\nof how.

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nPOLITICS\nEditor: Kartikeya\nRana\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nKartikeya Rana analyses the implications of US foreign policy\nJash Rughani looks into the escalating tensions between India and China\nTensions Escalate Between US and Germany\nKartikeya Rana\nPolitics Editor\nN\nSA whistleblower, Edward\nSnowden, has recently\nleaked documents\nstating that the US has\nbeen monitoring phone calls of\nAngela Merkel and other European\nleaders. According to a German\nnewspaper, Der Spiegel, the US has\nbeen monitoring Angela Merkel\u2019s\nphone since 2002. Such operations\nare said to be carried out by the\nUS in 80 destinations around the\nworld including Brazil, Mexico and\nFrance. This has resulted in growing\nanti American sentiment in these\ncountries.\nAngela Merkel has shown\npassionate discontent to the claims\nthat America wiretaps her phones.\nGerman people have a history of\nhaving mass surveillance been done\non them by dictatorial Communist\nand Nazi regimes. This has caused\nthem to be more sensitive to such\nsituations. German authorities have\nasked Washington to provide an\nexplanation. The US authorities have\nstated that they \u2018have not and will not\nbe monitoring\u2019 her mobile phone.\nThis does not necessarily mean that\nher phone was not monitored in the\npast. US and Germany are seen to be\nclose allies but this beach of trust has\nonly degraded the ties between the\ntwo nations. Tapping her phone is a\nclear infringement on her personal\nrights and sovereignty, which makes\nher response justi\ufb01able. \u201cIt will take a\nlot of time\u201d, Angela said, \u201cto build back\ntrust.\u201d\nThese revelations, however, should\nnot come as a surprise to her as spying\nby various intelligence services is very\nwell known. In fact, Germany has its\nown intelligence service directly under\nthe chancellor, called the Federal\nIntelligence Service (BND), which has\na comprehensive scheme of foreign\nintelligence gathering. Although some\nof the anger shown by the Chancellor\nmay be genuine, it may have also been\nin\ufb02uenced by the German public\noutcry against the actions of the NSA.\nAmerican spying operations tend to\nbe well known for states such as China\nand Russia but the desire to wire tap\na close ally such as Germany may\nseem strange to many. The decision\nmay have been in\ufb02uenced by the\nUS desire to get the best deal out of\nany bilateral trade agreements. By\nmonitoring Angela Merkel\u2019s mobile\nphone, the US can \ufb01nd out how to get\nthe best bargain out of any agreement\nwith Germany. It could also have been\ndone to speculate about prospective\nGerman domestic policy and \ufb01nd out\nwhether American companies should\ninvest in Germany.\nThe US stature on the world stage\nhas already been failing. The usage\nof drones has caused widespread\ndiscontent as the morality and ethics\nof using remote control weapons on\nhumans is questionable. The relatively\nhigh number of civilian casualties\ncaused by drones has further added\nto the negative public perception\ntowards their usage. The spying\noperations carried out by the NSA\nhave resulted in a further degradation\nof US International relations. German\ninvestments in US markets will now\nTalks held between India and China over a border dispute\nC\nhina\u2019s presence on the\nglobal economic platform\nhas been colossal since the\nturn of the millennium.\nIt has followed the\ntenets of inclusive growth and has\nmanaged to eradicate rural poverty\nwhile the GDP is pegged at about 9\ntrillion dollars annually. However,\nthe dragon country\u2019s real problems\nand aspirations lie outside of its\nboundaries. Or so it appears from its\nrelations with its neighbors.\nTies between China and Japan\nhave been repeatedly strained by\na territorial row over a group of\nislands,known as the Senkaku islands\nin Japan and the Diaoyu islands in\nChina.The eight uninhabited islands\nlie in the East China Sea and they\nhave a total area of about 7 square\nkm and lie northeast of Taiwan,\neast of the Chinese mainland and\nsouthwest of Japan\u2019s southern-most\nregion, Okinawa. These islands matter\nbecause they are close to strategically\nimportant shipping lanes, o\ufb00er rich\n\ufb01shing grounds and are thought to\ncontain oil deposits. In December\n2012 Japan said a Chinese government\nplane had violated its airspace over the\nislands and had caused much political\nturmoil in both the nations.\nIn October 2013 Philippines showed\nresistance to China\u2019s overwhelming\nnaval and maritime presence in the\nSouth China Sea and sought clarity\non China\u2019s territorial claims. The\nPhilippines, Vietnam, Malaysia,\nBrunei and Taiwan have partial or\ntotal claims to the resource-rich and\nhighly traversed sea while China\nmaintained that it has indisputable\nsovereignty over nearly the entire sea.\nYet a long stand-o\ufb00 between\nChinese and Indian soldiers in a\ndisputed part of Ladakh in September,\n2013 re\ufb02ects another profound\nproblem: already it ranks as the most\nserious confrontation between the\nAsian giants since the late 1980s. India\naccused its neighbour to the northeast of sending troops some 19km\npast a line of actual control (LAC),\nin the Despang area of Ladakh, a part\nof Jammu & Kashmir state that is\nwedged between Tibet proper and the\nvale of Kashmir. They had reportedly\nbeen there for more than two weeks\nand soon a small number of Indian\nsoldiers set up camp within a stone\u2019s\nthrow of their Chinese counterparts.\nThe incursion was seen simply as\nChina putting pressure on militarily\nweaker India, presumably to extract\nconcessions such as a freeze on the\nnumber of troops it deploys along\nthe border, or some block on India\u2019s\ndevelopment of bunkers, roads or\nJash Rughani\nPolitics Editor\nsu\ufb00er, as any German-US deal will\nbe put under scrutiny. Furthermore,\nit will be harder for the US to put\nforward reforms through the UN\nSecurity Council. Nations such as\nGermany and France are members of\nthe Security Council and any reform\nput forward by the US, regardless of\nits aim, would be seen with suspicion.\nIt will also cause the US to \ufb01nd it\nharder to convince European nations\nto partake as allies in con\ufb02icts around\nthe world.\nStrangely enough, the UK has\nnot provided noticeable reactions\nto the whole situation. There is a\ndeal between the UK and US, which\nprevents such spying operations\nbetween the two states. The UK may\nalso be holding back from reacting as\nit may have similar spying operations\nof its own. Recent reports suggest that\nthe UK Government Communication\nHeadquarters (GCHQ) have been\nspying on a German data cable.\nThe validity of the information\nprovided is also something that must\nbe questioned. Edward Snowden\nhas provided information whilst\nliving under asylum in Moscow. As\na former member of the NSA, he\nhas information about the workings\nof other security agencies as well.\nThe fact that he is only providing\ninformation about the American\nintelligence services may be because\nhe wishes to further his personal\ngains. Furthermore, the fact that he\nhas chosen to seek asylum in Moscow\nis rather suspicious. There is growing\ntension between Russia and the US\nregarding the situation in Syria.\nRussian authorities wish to give Assad\nmore time to dispossess hiws chemical\nweapons than the US is willing to o\ufb00er.\nThe damage caused to US-German\nrelationships is one, which will take\na long time to heal. The US now has\nto conduct a complete review of its\ninternational policy and change the\nway it takes part in international a\ufb00airs\nto improve its stand in the world.\nother structures on its own side of\nthe frontier. Any such freeze would\nleave Chinese forces, which are\nestablished on a plateau, in a much\nstronger position. They already enjoy\nthe bene\ufb01t of all-weather roads,\nrailway lines and other structures that\nconnect them to the rest of China.\nLastly, worsening bilateral relations\nwould be at odds with broader gains\nbetween the countries in other \ufb01elds.\nThe value of bilateral trade, skewed\nheavily in China\u2019s favour, has grown\nfrom just $2.9 billion a year at the start\nof the millennium to some $66 billion\nannually.China and India appear to\nco-operate as members of the BRICS\ngroup of countries, for example\nsharing a proposal to establish a new\nglobal development bank. And even\nalong the disputed border, the two\ncountries have established limited\nmechanisms for managing their\ndisagreements peacefully. India\u2019s\nprime minister, Manmohan Singh,\nwent to Beijing to discuss matters of\ntrade and border defense last week in\nthe wake of hope for peaceful ties and\nimproved relations.\nPolitical actions are much\ndeliberated over to create desired\nimpacts and outcomes. It is not\nsurprising to see the premier of a\nnation expecting general elections\nmaking overseas trips to strategically\nvalid nations or delivering powerful\nspeeches at international summits to\nwoo thevote banks. Similarly, It is not\ndi\ufb03cult to understand the underlying\nmotives of an imperialistic state trying\nto wield its in\ufb02uence on neighboring\ncountries. In my opinion, today\u2019s\nday and age where technological\nadvancements have transformed\nthe world into a single global village,\nit is in the interest of each nation to\nwork cordially alongside the others.\nThe in\ufb02ux of ideas across varied\nsocio-economic backgrounds can\nbe properly channeled with theever-growing infrastructure to facilitate\nbetter lifestyles. More than expanding\non the arsenal, nations need to\nbolster their intellectual capacity to\nsurvive global competition. Macabre\nwarfare needs to be renounced and\ndevelopment of soft skills deserves\ninvestments.\nCREDIT:WWW.NATIONALTURK.COM\nTHEHINDU.COM\n\n"

Not only\ndoes she nail the American accent,\nshe\u2019s a delightful, quirky addition to\none of the best Woody Allen films of\nrecent years. As a kind-hearted, for-giving, free spirit living her life as best\nshe can with the resources available to\nher, her Ginger strikes up a stark contrast with Blanchett\u2019s Jasmine.\nL\u00e9a Seydoux (Blue is the Warmest\nColour)\nStrong, charismatic, and confident are\ntraits the gutsy L\u00e9a Seydoux brings to\nthe controversial French Palme d\u2019Or\nwinner. The sizzling passion shared\nbetween the two actresses of this film\n(the other being the equally outstanding Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) are at the\nheart of this memorable love story,\nas every aspect of their relationship\nis laid out in the open for the audi-ence. Seydoux is both cool and chic,\nwith her raw intensity elevating this\nto something more than a mere saucy,\nerotic romp.\nOctavia Spencer (Fruitvale Station)\nShe may have won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for a largely comedic role in The Help, but Octavia\nSpencer\u2019s name this year is certainly in\nconsideration for her dramatic vigour\nin this Sundance breakout hit that was\nalso screened in Cannes where it received warm reception. As the mother\nof a man who we know from the beginning will be shot unlawfully in the\nback by a mistaken police officer, her\nendless sacrificing and hardworking\nnature become all the more painful to\nwatch, with her tough, no-nonsense\nstyle exuding love and warmth.\nMelissa Leo (Prisoners)\nNow who saw that twist coming?\nWith Melissa Leo, who so easily fits\ninto spooky, malicious, sinister roles,\nstarring in that massively pivotal role\nin this kidnap drama might have been\na dead giveaway as to the true nature\nof her character and the ending, but\nLeo always has that darkly magnetic\nappeal: is it the voice? Is it the looks?\nIt\u2019s hard to say what specifically but\nshe gets the job done and it\u2019s one she\ndoes well time and time again. She so\neffortlessly switches between a vulnerable old lady and a sadistic, grouchy\nkidnapper that it\u2019s scary.\nCarey Mulligan (Inside Llewyn Davis)\nNot only is she entertaining in a highly\namusing, fiery form, she shows she can\nalso sing, which is always a plus when\nit comes to the awards season. Establishing herself to be quite the diverse\nactress, Carey Mulligan has handled\na wide variety of roles over the years\nand her most recent, in a movie by\nthe Coen brothers, albeit brief, is one\nthat stands out. She absurdly missed\nout on a nomination for her work\nin Shame so here\u2019s hoping her work\ndoesn\u2019t go unnoticed this year. Every\ntime she yells out the word \u201casshole\u201d\nat the protagonist? Priceless...\nKristin Scott Thomas (Only God\nForgives)\nIt takes a special kind of mother to\ncomment on the sizes of her grownup sons\u2019 penises. And that special kind\nof mother is Kristin Scott Thomas in\nNicolas Winding Refn\u2019s dizzying, baffling new film. Thomas is full of dry,\ndark wit, as the drug-dealing, manipu-lative, incestuous mastermind behind\nher family\u2019s ultimate undoing. Her\nperformance is nothing short of jaw-droppingly shocking, with awkward,\nuncomfortable laughs abound. She\nalone is a good reason to check the\nfilm out.\nScarlett Johansson (Her)\nNow here\u2019s a slightly strange one. Johansson doesn\u2019t actually appear in the\nfilm. Word is she was never even on\nthe set of Spike Jonze\u2019s new quirky\nromantic dramedy that sees Joaquin\nPhoenix falling in love with a piece\nof technology voiced by Johansson.\nWhether the awards campaign behind\nher voice performance is actually a serious one or not waits to be seen, but\nto have a memorable on-screen appearance with only your voice takes\nconsiderable skill. With such tough\ncompetition ahead, it would be a surprise if this quirky choice got in.\nVanessa Redgrave (Song for Marion)\nHer rendition of Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u2018True\nColours\u2019 will reduce many to tears, as\nher frail and touching performance\nis simply first-class. It\u2019s been a while\nsince this great veteran has been given\nattention in the awards circuit, and it\nwill take a lot for a small, independent film that was released quite a\nwhile ago to make some sort of impact\nat this stage of the race, but given her\nname and standing in the industry,\nshe just might be able to squeeze in.\nHope they see her true colours shining through, because really, that\u2019s why\nwe love her.\nNaomie Harris (Mandela: Long Walk\nto Freedom)\nIs the new Miss Moneypenny of the\nBond franchise looking at a possible\nOscar nomination? While most per-formance-related praise of the film is\nreserved for the real star of the Nelson\nMandela biopic Idris Elba, Naomie\nHarris has also been given kind words\nto describe her interpretation of Winnie Mandela. When it comes to such\nimpassioned characters played with\nvigour and intensity by actors, it\u2019s difficult for the awards to ignore. She\nmay be a relative newcomer, but with\nsuch a big role, anything\u2019s possible.\nJennifer Lawrence (American Hustle)\nCould last year\u2019s Oscar winner be\nlooking at another nomination this\nyear? She\u2019s once again paired up with\nDavid O. Russell in her new film here,\nand although very few people have\nseen it, the buzz surrounding the\nmovie is already quite substantial. Plus\neveryone in Hollywood seems to be\nin love with the young Jennifer Lawrence who can clearly do no wrong.\nShe\u2019s funny, confident and as far as\nthe trailer goes, her sassy vibe seems\nto really suit her. With a release date\nin late December, the studio certainly\nhas faith - fingers crossed.\n\n"

The\nbus\u2019s tour guide told us we were\ntraveling through the epicentre of an\nearthquake as well as the reason why\nthere are so many horses in Iceland:\n\u201cThe land is so cheap you can buy a\nhorse, if you have one horse why not 2,\nand if you have two why not twenty!\u201d\nAs we drove deeper into Iceland\nwe went o\ufb00-road onto the F roads,\nsoon seeing a police super jeep and\na group of people raking the side of\nhill! Several river crossings later we\narrived at the collection of huts at\nLandmannalaugar. We however were\ncamping, and due to the rocky ground\nwe debated the merits of using pegs\nor rocks to secure the tents down\n\u2013 exciting stu\ufb00! After having lunch\nwe headed o\ufb00 on a day walk up the\nsurrounds hills to stretch our leg,\nand enjoyed a view of the solid lava\n\ufb02ows beneath us. The evening was\nspent relaxing in the warm natural\ngeothermal pool next to the campsite.\nOver the next four days we walked\nas planned from Landmannalaugar\nto Baser. On the \ufb01rst day on the trail\nwe walked through the lava \ufb01eld and\nthen up and higher. We got our \ufb01rst\nexperience of walking on the fragile\nIcelandic landscape, were a footstep\non moss can easily kill it, and many\nphotos of the plumes of sulphuric gas\nrising from the ground. The next day\nsaw us climbing over the snowing pass\nand down to \u00c1lftinnusker. There was\na democratic mutiny at the campsite,\nled by Sally, Sarah and Katharina with\nthe group deciding that they would\nrather stay in the hut away from the\nbiting wind and cold than camp. After\nbeing told by the hut warden that we\nweren\u2019t allowed up any mountains\ndue to the closing storm, Charlie\nand I settled for a brisk run around a\nnearby lake before too staying in the\nwarm hut. The next two days saw us\nwalking downhill towards B\u00e1sar. Here\nthe scenery became less snowy and\nturning into a black desert. We had\nto wade several rivers, only knee deep\nbut very cold, creating a lot of fa\ufb00 as\npeople removed their boots to cross.\nApproaching B\u00e1sar we walked through\nthe area known as \u201cAlmenningar\u201d\nwith crossing the river \u00der\u00f6ng\u00e1 which\nis glacier-fed but which is widely\nbraided at the crossing point and only\nknee-deep max. The landscape and\nvegetation changed rapidly during\nthis section\u2014Birchwood and all kinds\nof plants emerged, a welcome change\nto the desert behind us. We met up\nwith Joe, who came bearing gifts of\nchocolate, cheese and chorizo to liven\nup our diet.\nThe next day was a relaxing rest day\nfor those weary from being on their\nfeet all day and enjoyed the bathing\npools near the hut and the warming\nhot chocolate. Meanwhile some of\nus walked up an exceptionally pointy\nmountain \u2013 walking the furthest and\nhighest we had all trip but thankfully\nwithout our heavy rucksacks. The\nsummit had a great view. Our 6th\nand \ufb01nal day of walking started early\nwith us climbing over 1000m passing\nbetween the glaciers \u201cEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull\u201d\nand \u201cM\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull\u201d and climbing\nIceland\u2019s newest hills \u201cMagni\u201d and\n\u201cModi\u201d. On the way down we passed\n23 waterfalls as we approached the\n\ufb01nish of the trail at Skogar.\nAfter travelling back to Reykjavik\nwe spent the following day driving\naround the Golden Circle route seeing\nthe mid-Atlantic ridge in \u00deingvellir\nand the Gullfoss waterfall, thanks to\nour three drivers Sally, Jessi and Joe.\nOur \ufb01nal day was spent relaxing\nin Reykjavik before getting the \ufb02ight\nback to England. Many thanks to\neveryone who came along and I am\nsure everyone will agree it was an\namazing experience.\nIC FELLWALKING\nJack Redvers-Harris\nFellwalker\nBrilliant start for\nWater Polo team in LUSL\nAlex Lloyd-Simpson\nWater Polo Captain\nFollowing the loss of many excellent\nplayers this year, namely ex Team\nGB vice-captain Adam, we were\nworried we\u2019d \ufb01nd a team with as\nmuch quality and \ufb01nesse as our old\nBUCS team this year. Fortunately we\ndid some great work at the Fresher\u2019s\nFair and managed to recruit several\noutstanding players, including some\ngirls who were actually familiar\nwith the game, which is rare. Not\nto mention the guys we got, who\ncertainly know how to handle their\nballs.\nOur \ufb01rst \ufb01xture, last week, saw\nus pitted against UCL\u2019s 2nd team,\na team we were initially quietly\ncon\ufb01dent we would beat with ease.\nAs it turns out, we didn\u2019t have to\nbe quiet about it at all. Final score\nending 20-2 (a huge margin for\nWater Polo) in Imperial\u2019s favour\nsaw some well-deserved celebratory\ndrinks in ULU\u2019s \u201cLibrary\u201d. This\nwas the \ufb01rst time our team had\nplayed together, with many of us\nnot knowing each other\u2019s names,\nit is a testament to how well we\ncan complement and gel with each\nother as a team. The match itself\nbegan with some intimidating\nsynchronised stretching, led by the\n\u201cnutter\u201d Livio, followed by some\nhalf-arsed widths of the pool. We\nscored immediately from the swim\no\ufb00 giving us an early lead. However\nsome dodgy refereeing saw UCL\nquickly equalise, but that was to be\nonly half of their total goals scored.\nImperial soon slotted 18 more\npassed them, with some cracking\nshots being \ufb02ung in from everyone,\napart from Stuart. Only thing to\nreally work on was setting up a\ndecent arc, with most of our goals\ncoming from counter attacks, but\nmost importantly, UCL were easily\ndisposed of.\nThe next \ufb01xture saw us travelling\nout to St Barts in Shadwell, where\nSophie declared she felt at home once\nagain. Upon arrival at the pool, the\nladies had to wait to in the changing\nroom whilst the men only swimming\nsession ended, certainly a bizarre\nsituation for all of us. A freezing cold\npool meant actually having to do\na decent warm up for once. Wasn\u2019t\nreally needed that much though as\nthe St Barts players were knackered\nafter only 2 quarters. They also had\nan illegal sized squad of about 20\nplayers (maximum allowed being\n13), almost double our elite 11 we\nbrought along. Still, this didn\u2019t help\nthem in the swimming or water\npolo department. The refereeing\nwas also worse than the \ufb01rst match,\nsomething we didn\u2019t think possible-one referee was heard saying to a\nteammate \u201ccan you take over, I don\u2019t\nknow the rules\u201d. Sophie was however\nkind enough to explain the rules on\nmultiple occasions and even o\ufb00ered\nto take over refereeing duties at one\npoint - sadly they declined. Again\nsome great goals were scored, this\ntime even Stuart got one, and James\n(not Edward) showed us all how\nto properly play Water Polo after\na great drive in to pit from the arc,\n\ufb01ring the ball past the defenceless\ngoalie. Despite the horrendous\nrule breakages, we still won 9-1, a\ncommendable victory.\nNext on the agenda is our raucous\ntour to Aachen, Germany this\nweekend which is pretty much\nthe highlight of the Water Polo\nsocial calendar. We look forward\nto socialising with our German\ncounterparts, and maybe indulging\nin some Water Polo with them as\nwell.\nICU WATER POLO\n\n"

However, not very many\ncountries around the world are in\na similarly happy dilemma about\nchoosing which means of energy\nproduction to pursue. Further to\nthat, which one ought the UK to be\nreally pursuing as well, when climate\nchange and environmental e\ufb00ects are\nconsidered?\nTo know which way to go forward,\nwe must \ufb01rst eliminate which ways\nhybrid vehicles (for which the supply\nand variety on o\ufb00er is comparatively\nvery limited).\nIt may seem a na\u00efve reason to turn\nup one\u2019s nose at a possible future\nenergy production method, but unless\nthe public is persuaded to recognise\nand care more about the bigger\npicture and how it\u2019s not none of their\nbusiness, for instance how harvesting\nhydroelectric energy could lead to\nthem enjoying better air quality for\na longer time period in the future\ndespite having to drive un\ufb02ashy cars,\nthere is not much that can and will get\ndone about the energy problem. Solar\nenergy could end up being our best bet\non paper, with minimal climatological\nand environmental side-e\ufb00ects, but if\nno one appreciates it, it would not get\ndeveloped on at all.\nWith climate change and the\nenvironment taking centre stage in the\npublic consciousness more often than\never before, we also tend to forget\nabout all the existing infrastructure,\nequipment, systems, networks, and\nresources related to fossil fuels that we\nhave which will fall into obsolescence\nwhen a new energy technology takes\nover, unless their compatibility issues\nlead back. Fossil fuels are commonly\nperceived as being one such doomed\npath \u2013 even though their carbon\nfootprint is decreasing through means\nof technological development and\ninnovations such as carbon capture &\nstorage (CCS) techniques, their lack of\naccessible deposits and the economic\n& environmental setbacks associated\nwith digging further and deeper mean\nthat, for any country, sticking purely\nto fossil fuels to meet energy demands\nis only going to cause bigger problems\nafter the short-term future comes to\npass.\nAnother point of consideration is\nthe ways in which any energy solution\nwould factor into our lives and the\nway we use energy on the personal\nlevel. This is a very motivating factor\nwhich a\ufb00ects public opinion \u2013 for\ninstance, consider the e\ufb00ect on the\nprivate transportation sector. Some\ncommunities in developed countries\nare more welcoming of biofuels\nreplacing petrol because it would\nstill allow them to use their preferred\nvehicle models, whereas they may\nnot be so keen on wind/hydroelectric\nenergy being the substitute as it may\nmean they have to swap to electric/\ncan be solved.\nCoal mines that would be shut down\ncould potentially be developed to\nharness geothermal energy instead,\nwhilst petrochemical processing\nfacilities could be adapted to produce\nmore e\ufb03cient biofuels\u2026on the other\nhand, nuclear power stations are not\nable to adapt much existing energy\ninfrastructure (including the vast\nmarine and land transportation\nnetworks that exist primarily to serve\ntransport of oil & natural gas.)\nThis is a critical point as existing\nresources need to be redeployed as\ne\ufb03ciently as possible so su\ufb03cient\nnew resources can be directed\ntowards developing any given energy\ntechnology. Physical space in our\nenvironment is a precious commodity\nthat is constantly becoming scarcer,\nso the extent of utilisation of preexisting infrastructure would also\nplay a signi\ufb01cant role in determining\nwhich source of energy is deemed\nmost suitable for development\nin a particular country or region.\nMinimising the need for new land and\nconstruction generally might mean a\nsmaller impact upon the environment\nand would avoid considerably\nincreasing the number of sources\nof carbon emissions in worldwide\nhuman activity.\nFinally, any energy technology that\nwe choose to progress needs to be\nsustainable \u2013 a key di\ufb00erence from\nour main energy sources in the past.\nThis heavily involves the economic\nand \ufb01nancial aspects of the matter\nand also relates to the source of the\nenergy; whether it is renewable or not.\nThe energy sector is perhaps the most\nimportant economic sector and its\nfuture form would also need to be able\nto sustain jobs and livelihoods, which\nmeans it needs to be invested into.\nFurthermore, some possibilities such\nas biofuels are in the grey area as to\nwhether they are renewable, however\nother such as solar energy and nuclear\nenergy are considered virtually\ninexhaustible due to their sources\u2019\nsheer reserves/energy densities.\nWant to hear more conclusive and\ninsightful discussions about the future\nof energy?

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nConfessions of a GTA: Part 4\nA\ns an undergrad, \ufb01eld\ntrips were always best in\nhindsight. Those hours\non a windblown moor\nin the back of beyond\nin the pouring rain seemed later like\nquite a laugh and that time you nearly\ngot impaled on machinery by an irate\nScottish factory worker who did not\ncare how interested you were in the\nmanufacturing was, looking back, an\n\u201cadventure\u201d. The stress of \ufb01nishing\nnotes, living with some random\non your course who you had never\nheard speak until now, and trying\nto understand what exactly your\nProfessor was yelling over a gale force\nwind, for most people were the good\ntimes of the course. I, as a keen indoor\nsportsman, remember it without the\nrose tint.\nYou can imagine my horror when\nmy supervisor looked hopefully across\nthe desk from me, having indicated he\nreally could use help on this trip which\nwas, of course, over the weekend.\nBattered by his assurances that it never\nrained on this trip and thinking of it\nas a paid day out, I resignedly agreed.\nI immediately went and cleared the\nsale of the closest outdoor shop just\nin case.\nSo there I stood, handing out notes\nto people I did not know at 8am\non a very cold Saturday morning.\nThe weather forecast was stormy. I\ntried desperately to work out how\nmuch I would be paid every second\nonly to realise that actually made it\nmore depressing. Then suddenly we\nwere all on the coach, setting o\ufb00 to a\nhellish nowhere to look at nothing in\nparticular.\nBut to my surprise, I did not have\nto look at nothing in particular,\nmake notes on something I did not\nunderstand, or try and draw a picture\nof a piece of equipment whose purpose\nwas not entirely clear. Instead I got to\nstand at the back of a well-behaved\ngroup of people, being plied with tea\nand chocolate by the other lecturers\non the trip. I did not even have to\nworry about timings or the teaching.\nThis the sta\ufb00 assured me was their\nproblem. My main purpose seemed\nto be to prevent the students walking\ninto the road, which they managed\npretty well on their own, with only one\nor two near death incidents.\nIt turned out to, be quite sunny and\nI could even remove my nice new\nmicro\ufb02eece, hat, waterproof trousers\nand gloves and pretend I was on the\nbeach. This was great and was rapidly\nimproved by a very nice three course\ndinner in the hotel. I even got my\nown room. Yes, it was not a hotel\nthat I would have picked by myself,\nbut hey, I was being paid for this.\nNot to mention the slightly random\nlayout meaning that my bathroom\nwas huge, actually massive. So a nice\nfree dinner and pint later I could quite\ncomfortably fall asleep in front of the\nTV.\nI could get used to \ufb01eld trip GTAing.\n\u201cOn a field trip a GTA is the best person to be\u201d\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\nYou want us to change the picture, do you? Fine, have a unicorn.\nEoghan J. Totten\n@eoghantotten\nComment Editor\nBoris: Resolute Vertebrate Jelly Part II\n\u201cIf the ball came loose from the back\nof the scrum, which it won\u2019t of course,\nit would be a great, great thing to have\na crack at.\n\u201d\nT\nhese were the words of Boris\nJohnson on a hypothetical\nbid for The Conservative\nParty leadership, speaking to\nthe BBC\u2019s Michael Cockerell\nfor a May 2013 broadcast. Their\nlight-hearted \ufb02ippancy is somewhat\nendearing but they also conjure\nimages of the home counties. This\ncannot be avoided.\nOne cannot fault the apparent gusto\nwith which Boris Johnson approaches\nhis mayorship. His \u20189- point plan for\na Greater London\u2019 was both succinct\nand pragmatic. Perhaps (in my view)\nthis is the crux of any criticism that\nmight be directed towards him. His\ndelineation of London\u2019s foibles may\nprove to be a gross oversimpli\ufb01cation\nof a vastly complex social and\neconomic focal point; Boris Johnson\ntends to focus on the latter. While\nhis pledge to create 200,000 jobs, as\na conduit for raising citizens out of\npoverty, is a noble endeavour, it could\nbe misconstrued as clandestine and\ndisengaged.\nLondon is not a \ufb01ctional metropolis\nlike Gotham City, where criminality\nis asphyxiated and bludgeoned into\nsubmission. Neither will a punctual\ntransport network remedy all\nproblems. These are isolated solitudes\nin themselves. They are desirable but\nwithout a focal point their full impact\nwill be lost. In London complications\nare not black and white. There is only\ngrey.\nConsider Mr. Johnson\u2019s pledge\nto create more \u2018green space\u2019 for\nLondoners. It makes sense. By de\ufb01ning\nregionsforrespite,cityhallcanprovide\nmore opportunities for the average\n\u2018Londoner\u2019 to withdraw from a myriad\nof pressures. This may catalyse social\ncohesion, promote tolerance and\nencourage patience. My criticism of\nthe measure is its lack of focus. Green\nspaces are a means to an end; they are\nnot an end in themselves. Any bene\ufb01ts\nwould need to be led by the people.\nAn inherent social link to the land\nwould need to be forged. Green space\nin Peckham, Lewisham or Lambeth\nwill solve nothing in isolation. Instead,\nby fashioning a cultural link to the\nlocalised community, the bene\ufb01ts\ncould prove boundless.\nA recurrent characteristic of\nthese social links is longevity. This\nis something that London typically\nlacks. As a burgeoning hive of\ncausality, activity is both \ufb02uid and\ndynamic. Continuity of Government,\njustice and equality will not maintain\nitself without the intervention of\ncity hall. The Mayor\u2019s 200,000 job\npledge is noble. Despite this one\nmight choose to note Boris Johnson\u2019s\nsupport of free markets and energetic\ncapitalism. There is no doubt that\nthe jobs will come. My concern is\nthat the enterprising entrepreneurs\nand businesses will glaze over the\ndisenfranchised or impoverished\nLondoner. The spider\u2019s web proves\nto be a most \ufb01tting analogy. Canary\nWharf, Pall Mall and Mayfair may\nlie on the strands of the web but\nother areas \ufb01ll the void. Without an\negalitarian e\ufb00ort to bring jobs to one\nand all this may continue to be the\ncase. By 2015 city hall may run the\nrisk of morphing a sizeable income\ndisparity into an irrecoverable void.\nThis leads into City Hall\u2019s\nendeavours to rejuvenate transport.\nThe Crossrail project, in combination\nwith the proposed airport on the\nThames estuary and the hypothetical\n\u2018Heathwick\u2019 rail link show that e\ufb00orts\nare both concentrated and e\ufb03cient. In\nparticular, with the Crossrail tunnel\nhaving reached the half-way house\nunder Gospel Oak, Boris Johnson\ncan now exhibit active substance\nto complement his initiatives.\nOnce again I bring you back to the\n\u2018web\u2019 analogy. The projects serve as\nconduits to speed \ufb01nanciers, scientists\nand the well-endowed among us onto\nbigger and better things. The poor are\nleft in idleness. The counterpoint to\nthis might be that such an approach\nserves as a stepping stone to outreach.\nI suspect that this won\u2019t happen.\nSoaring London Underground fares\nmay serve as substance to this instinct.\nThe lines may have been rejuvenated\nand the trains made punctual during\nBoris Johnson\u2019s premiership but this\nhas happened in line with such fares.\nThe poor man is short of options and\n\ufb01nds his way barred.\nRe\ufb02ections on the London 2012\nOlympic Games serve as a suitable\nclosing point. I once referred to their\nlegacy as \u2018\ufb02at-packed\u2019. At the close\nof the games the gates were locked\nand barred and decommissioning\nbegan without pause for breath. Bike\nlanes became a thing of the past and\nbidding for the Stadium gathered\nforce. This might be regarded as a\nmissed opportunity for City Hall.\nThere was an opportunity to fashion a\nutilitarian model for London centred\non cycling, culture and sport. It was\na shame that short-term pragmatism\ntook precedence over a deeply-rooted\nlegacy.\nIt is not too late. If anyone can pull it\no\ufb00, it is Boris Johnson.\n\u201cLondon is not a\nfictional metropolis\nlike Gotham City\u201d\nDAILY MAIL\n\n"

With the clocks going back\nalarms were tentatively set, not really\nknowing whether we\u2019d unknowingly\ncause ourselves to turn up to the race\nan hour early or not! A crucial race\nbanana was munched and I set o\ufb00 into\nthe rain at 6.30am with nerves and\napprehension. With this being my \ufb01rst\nduathlon I was relieved to be warmly\ngreeted at registration by chairman\nEd Hallett (he\u2019s doing a great job, by\nthe way) who helped me rack my bike\ninto optimum streamline setup in\ntransition and calmed my nerves.\nThe course began with a 4.2 km\nrun lap around the serpentine. Then\na quick transition onto the bike for\na 20.8 km, 8 lap course up and down\nSouth Carriage Drive (with nervously\nwet hairpin bends at each end), and\n\ufb01nally a 7.6 km (two laps) run to\n\ufb01nish us o\ufb00. After signing up for\nthe event, I hadn\u2019t quite realised how\nfar the distances were, and although\nmy training had been good, it wasn\u2019t\nexactly going to be a sprint!\nThe aptly named Jekyll and Hyde\nPark Duathlon, unlike similar races,\nhad a prize for the best fancy dress\ncostume. Brandishing our new sexy\nawesome trisuits (yes, they have a lion\non the back!) we decided to ignore the\ninvitation for fancy dress. But there\nwere some excellent entries including\na road kill fox and the fancy dress\nwinner who had come as a devil and\neven made her bike into some kind of\ndevil-mobile, complete with a trident!\nAnyway, after a quick race brie\ufb01ng\nand reminder to not \u2018accidentally\u2019\nwalk o\ufb00 with someone else\u2019s bike\nafter the race, we started. The clouds\nparted and the unthinkable happened:\nthe sun came out! Personally, I had a\nreally comfortable \ufb01rst lap run, which\nwas familiar as it\u2019s the same as the\nVicky Solli gives her account as Imperial run against \u201croadkill fox\u201d\nHyde Park Relays women\u2019s route (an\nevent run by ICXC in March, everyone\nshould enter), and managed a pretty\nseamless transition onto the bike,\nwhere I felt pretty strong! The bike\ncourse was surprisingly fun, especially\nduring my \ufb01rst few laps pretending\nI was racing with all the supreme\nmen, and had the b-e-a-utiful sound\nof carbon drifting past me! After\nmanaging to count 8 laps correctly, I\ndismounted Charlie (yes, my bike has\na name) and pulled the running shoes\nback on. Then my legs just seemed to\ngive up, and turned to lead! But true\nto my style, (not great at sport, but\nalways give it my best shot) I plodded\nround the two laps to the \ufb01nish! In\nre\ufb02ection I did get a decent time and\ncame 33rd out of the women \ufb01eld.\nHaving had my birthday recently, I\nwas lucky to get a new Garmin watch\n(the 910XT) to collect data and stats\nabout my training and races; oh yes,\nthe analysis does get me excited!\nThankfully the multisport mode\nworked, seamlessly changing from\none sport to another and it even\nrecorded my transitions. Now I can\nponder over graphs and split times to\nmy heart\u2019s content, even if I do look\nlike \u201call the gear but no idea!\u201d\nLess about me, we had some great\nracers out there! Milan Misak had\nan absolutely awesome race coming\n25th over all and proved to the carbon\njunkies that you can go pretty damn\nfast on a single speed! Kudos! Aimee\nDi Marco also put in a great e\ufb00ort after\ncoming back from injury, to come in\n8th out of the women. Old boy Sam\nO\u2019Neill came along, claiming he hadn\u2019t\ndone any training since his Iron Man,\nwhich I believe was a lie as he came in\n30th. Ed Hall (as Mr Hallett was for\nthe day) put in a supreme e\ufb00ort on his\nnearly all carbon \u201cit only weighs 8 kg\u201d\nbike, with Marcel Admiraal and Sam\nJackson putting in sterling e\ufb00orts also.\nAfterwards we managed to crash the\nIC Cross Country and Athletics post-Sunday long run breakfast. Cheers to\nMatt Douthwaite, the fry up and cups\nof tea were greatly appreciated! And\nit meant we got to show o\ufb00 our race\nt-shirts which it seems are much more\npractical than medals!\nSo, fancy a challenge? Like to get\nstuck in? And maybe are a little bit\ncrazy? Triathlon club is awesome!\nSome really great people that support\nand push each other through training,\nraces and the occasional party night\n(we are athletes, except on Wednesday\nnights, of course!)

    "content": "39\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 01 NOV\nCGCU\nMy dear engineering friends,\nWhen they \ufb01rst announced the new CGCU President\nearlier in March this year, I clearly remembered how\nLotanna Agu single-handedly hoisted me into the air.\nAbove the crowd cheering for me, I shouted one of my\nmost memorable campaign slogans out loud \u201cYou can\ncount on me!\u201d Like many of my good friends, Lotanna\nwas counting on me to usher in an unprecedented\nyear ahead for the CGCU even as I counted on all of\nthem for their utmost support and vote to open up a\ndoor for me to do so.\nSome say that the \ufb01re within the CGCU had died out\nover the past decade, but I assure them that there will\nalways be a few of us whom its members can count on\nto keep the \ufb02ame going. It is with no greater joy that\nmy 2013/2014 committee and I have been granted\nthis opportunity to enrich the university experience of\nour fellow engineering students this year, to dedicate\nourselves to the revival of the CGCU brand name and\nspirit amongst all of you.\nDick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, said:\n\u201cBelieve that if you make courageous choices and bet\non yourself and put yourself out there, that you will\nhave an impact as a result of what you do. And you\ndon\u2019t need to know now what that would be or how will\nit happen because no one ever does.\n\u201d\nWe\u2019ve made bold choices to revise our publicity\nthemes and methods, overhaul our o\ufb03ce, revamp our\nwebsite and restore our highly-coveted events and\ntraditions, not knowing what the outcome will be. All\nthese came with tireless hours over the summer holidays and sacri\ufb01ces alongside our already hectic academic schedule (it\u2019s Imperial after all).\nWhat have we achieved so far? For a start, I hope you\n\ufb01nd that you\u2019re receiving much fewer emails as before\n(and certainly of better design and quality) and seeing\nmore of your student reps publicizing our fantastic\nevents to you in person. Our CGCU o\ufb03ce is now a\nmore desirable place for you to come visit us with your\nfeedback (we are your student voice to the college!).\nJames and Juliet, our academic a\ufb00airs and welfare of\ufb01cers in particular, have so generously set aside their\nlunchtimes on Tuesdays and Fridays to receive you on\nthose matters.\nFinally, we saw over-the-top attendance and reception\nfor our CGCU Welcome Dinner which ended o\ufb00 with\na roaring Boomalaka cheer.\nYet this is just but the beginning of a new chapter.\nTake heart, for the best is yet to come. Bringing you\nback to my election results day, the relationship between Lotanna and me is like the CGCU and its com-mittee. For as much as the committee can do and\nmust do, it is ultimately the faith and dedication of all\nits members upon which this union relies.\nThere are many more wonderful events on its way,\nincluding the Dinner with Industry, Alumni Careers\nEvening and the Club Night to celebrate the end of a\nmomentous term! The ball is now in your court to get\ninvolved in all of them and more than that, spread the\nC&G identity to your fellow peers. We\u2019re counting on\nyou to take our union to greater heights!\nSincerely Yours,\nLejon\nPresident\u2019s Open Letter\non behalf of the CGCU\nFelix catches up with the City & Guilds\nUnion. We hear what they\u2019ve been\ngetting up to over the last few week and\nwhat we can expect for the future.\nIntegrating Engineers: the way\nto reviving the CGCU brand\nGeeky punnery aside, the City and\nGuilds College Union (better known\nas the CGCU) has bounced back this\nyear - having spent a good while in\nrelative \u201cCGC-who?\u201d obscurity. With\na fresh-faced committee in place\nworking towards a uni\ufb01ed theme\n- \u201cintegrating engineers\u201d - the year\nahead promises to be a good one.\nMascotry, Slave Auctions et al\nOne of the key priorities for the\nGuilds committee was a large-scale\nrevival of some of the forgotten Guilds\ntraditions, and an early violation of\nour rival\u2019s mascot - RCSU\u2019s Theta\n(after 40 years!) - provided us with just\nthe platform to kick-start that. Whilst\n\ufb01nal negotiations are still underway,\nwe\u2019ve used this as an opportunity to\nbring back the Slave Auction (and\nhave the RCSU President participate\nin it) in order to raise funds for CGCU\nRAG; something which has not been\ndone since 2009/2010. This\u2019ll take\nplace in the Spring term during RAG\nweek - so keep your eyes/ears peeled,\nand ideas for embarrassing things for\nPresident Saha to do handy (so long as\nyou\u2019re willing to pay for charity!)\nHaving also revived the tradition of\npieing our own committee last year as\na homage to the Hit Squad - which has\nits roots and old ownership in CGCU\n- we\u2019re keeping up the tradition and\nhave agreed to have our bearers \u201ctake\nthe cream\u201d; again, for RA. In addition,\nthe Mech Eng building was renamed\nthe City and Guilds building this year\n- a signi\ufb01cant moment that harks back\nto one of Imperial\u2019s older milestones,\nback when the City and Guilds\nCollege came together with the other\nconstituent colleges to form Imperial\nCollege London.\nCGCU Welcome Dinner\nJust this Tuesday we hosted the\nCGCU\u2019s \ufb02agship Welcome Dinner\nand Afterparty, held at Cafe de Paris\nafter having been absent for a year.\nDinner tickets sold out a week in\nadvance, resulting in a bit of a frenzy\nfor It was a great chance for newbies\n(and not-so-fresh students) to mingle\nand have a posh three-course meal\nin a swanky setting, and to build a\nsense of community amongst the\nengineers. With a bevy of freshers\npresent alongside some distinguished\nguests from the City and Guilds\nCollege Association (CGCA) - the\nalumni association for engineers - it\nwas a perfect mix of both old and new,\nand certainly ties back to the whole\ntheme for this year. For want of a\nbetter phrase to describe proceedings:\neveryone ate, drank, and was merry.\nCGCU/CGCA Alumni Careers\nLecture\nSpeaking about our alumni (and more\nclich\u00e9s!)...the saying \u201cold is gold\u201d\ncertainly has some truth in it. The\ncommittee have worked tirelessly\non getting further involvement from\nthe alumni of said association, The\nImperial College of their days may not\nbe identical to the Imperial of now,\nbut that doesn\u2019t stop them from being\na valuable mine of information when\nit comes to careers/life advice. As\nsuch, there\u2019ll be an upcoming CGCA\nCareers lecture on the 3rd of Dec\nwhich will be a great chance to trade\nthoughts and ideas with our alumniwe\u2019re taking the impersonal feel out of\nbog-standard networking events.\nCGCU Of\ufb01ce Hours/Welfare\nBut of course, Guilds is more than\njust funny traditions or social/careers\nevents for the engineering community\n- even though there\u2019s de\ufb01nitely more\nto look forward to on the calendar,\nsuch as bar nights and club nights!\nWe\u2019re here to look after your welfare,\nand there\u2019s our weekly O\ufb03ce Hours\n- a dedicated initiative from our\nAcademic A\ufb00airs O\ufb03cer (James\nMurphy) and Welfare O\ufb03cer (Juliet\nKernohan.) It\u2019s simple: we post times\nup on our Facebook page (they tend\nto be every Friday), and you just swing\nby the City and Guilds O\ufb03ce in room\n340 if you want to get something o\ufb00\nyour chest/wish to \ufb01nd out more\nabout getting involved/managed\nto get your hands on the Medics\u2019\nPhoenix head (we jest.) The team will\nalso be hosting our own Welfare Week\nfor engineers in the Spring (who says\nonly scientists get to have one?), and\nthere\u2019s lots lined up including cookery\nand self-defense classes. All in all,\nplenty to be excited about!\nThat said, there\u2019s only so much that\nthe committee can do in terms of\norganizing events for you guys and\npublicizing. Really, we owe much\nof our success to every Guildsman\n(and Guildswoman) getting out there\nand playing your part. It\u2019s thanks to\nyou guys spreading the good word,\nattending our events and engaging\nwith us that we\u2019ve gotten o\ufb00 to a\ngreat start so far - we hope to see\nmore involvement in the months to\ncome, whether it\u2019s just participating\nas an attendee or even throwing us a\nsuggestion for improvement. May the\nrest of the year be even better for us,\nand for you too!\nCity and Guilds College Union\nwww.cgcu.net\nKeeping up with the Engineers\nCGCU\nTOP: CGCU at Caf\u00e9 de Paris; BOTTOM: CGCU Welcome Dinner time!\n\u201cWith a\nfresh-faced\ncommittee in\nplace working\ntowards a\nuni\ufb01ed theme\n- \u02bbintegrating\nengineers\u02bc - the\nyear ahead\npromises to be\na good one.\u201d\n\u201cBut of course,\nGuilds is more\nthan just funny\ntraditions or\nsocial/careers\nevents for the\nengineering\ncommunity\u201d\n\n"

Win a slice of a prize pot of\nover \u00a34000.\nThese chances have one factor in common: this\nyear\u2019s RCSU Science Challenge. It\u2019s big and it\u2019s\nback, launching on December 3 in SAF. You\nshould come to the launch event and accept the\nchallenge o\ufb00ered to you. Here\u2019s why.\nThe Science Challenge is the RCSU\u2019s annual\ncompetition. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity for you\nto communicate science in an engaging, concise\nand fun manner. Four high pro\ufb01le judges will\nset three essay questions and a task for a video\ncategory.\nEvery year the selected judges give up their time\nto talk at the launch and grand \ufb01nal events, and\nchose the overall winners. They are leaders in their\n\ufb01elds: academia, science, journalism, business.\nLast year the Director of Grantham Institute for\nClimate Change, Professor Sir Brian Hoskins,\njudged one question. The year before Wellcome\nTrust Head of Communications and former\nScience Editor of the Times Mark Henderson was\ninvolved.\nLord Winston is the leading judge. He should be\na familiar face from British television. You might\nhave seen him on campus since he\u2019s Emeritus\nProfessor of Fertility Studies here at Imperial, but\nhaving been here for three years and only seen\nthe back of his suit once I don\u2019t think it likely. At\nthe launch you\u2019ll de\ufb01nitely get to see his face and\nhear his voice, live. You could get a photograph of\nyourself with him at the grand \ufb01nal next year.\nThe Science Challenge is generously sponsored.\nPrevious winners have received tours of CERN in\nSwitzerland and big cash prizes. In 2014 it could\nbe you walking away with such treats because\nall Imperial students can enter the competition,\nregardless of faculty. Even if you hate the RCSU\nhow could you pass up the opportunity to win\npotentially thousands of pounds? I\u2019m going to\nguess no one hates the RCSU that much. Not even\nCGCU students.\nKeep an eye out for more Science Challenge\ndetails in Felix over the next few Fridays. Look out\nfor our posters around campus, updated weekly.\nKeep December 3 free in your diary. There will be\nfree food and entertainment at the launch before\nthe questions and prizes are announced. The\nguest speaker has an exciting history and the talk\nwill be worth hearing.\nThe Science Challenge is coming. Are you ready?\nTweet @RCSU with the hashtag #SciChal to keep\nthe mystery alive.\nSmoky not Smudgy\nNida Mahmud on this Sunday\u02bcs ladies only event\nAs Charity Week draws to an end, this\nSunday marks the return of Smoky Not\nSmudgy (SnS); this is a \ufb02agship ladies only\npampering event.\nSnS is run by the ladies for the ladies.\nAll proceeds go towards the Charity Week\ncampaign, ultimately helping orphans and\nneedy children in the poorest parts of the\nworld.

With\nservices such as Net\ufb02ix or your more\nillegal torrenting websites such as\n\u2018The Piratebay\u2019 getting that movie\nyou\u2019ve been longing to watch is now\njust a click away rather than \ufb01ve\nblocks away.\nNow I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that when\nsomeone on the other side of the\nworld is communicating with you via\nwritten text, it is di\ufb00erent from them\nhaving a face to face conversation\nwith you whilst their body language\nis in full swing. I\u2019m pretty sure\neveryone\u2019s been in a situation where\nthey simply couldn\u2019t detect if their\nfriend was being sarcastic or genuine.\nIt\u2019s always with phrases such as KK\n(ok cool) or that Facebook thumbs\nup at the end of a conversation that\ngets delivered to me after telling one\nbadass story that does my head in.\nThe internet has literally killed o\ufb00\nproductivity. Obviously, you can\nargue that the internet is full of useful\ninformation that you can utilise for\nyour own learning bene\ufb01t, but the\nreality of it is that you\u2019ll always have\na billion other distractions to take\nyou o\ufb00 your pursuit of knowledge.\nI crown YouTube and Facebook\nas the king and queen of worldwide procrastination. The strangely\nbeautiful thing about YouTube is that\nyou can go on it with the intention\nof watching say a one 5 minute music\nvideo but somehow end up on a\n\u2018Kaka owns Xavi\u2019 video.\nBefore the late 90\u2019s or early 00\u2019s if\nyou were ever seen taking a picture\nof your meal before eating it, you\u2019d\nprobably get sent to your nearest\nlunatic asylum without the slightest\nWhen the word \u2018troll\u2019 is typed/\nspoken/read on the internet, it no\nlonger refers to the great big mythical\nbeast that used to terrorize villagers\nin Scandinavia.

Now at \ufb01rst this may just\nseem harmless, a cookie is just a text\n\ufb01le at the end of the day, but trust me\nyou can tell a lot about a person just\nby looking at their online activity.\nThis should probably be under\n\u201910 search engines Google has\nslaughtered,\u2019 but for me Google is the\ninternet and the internet is Google.\nWikipedia pretty much sums this all\nup.\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nOsama Awara\nTechnology Editors\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up\nto date with the newest, wierdest and most futuristic things\naround\nMovie Stores\nEncyclopaedias\nSarcasm and\nSubtlety\nProcrastination\nControl\nPrivacy\nYahoo, Bing,\nJeeves et al.\nTrolls\nKeeping Silly\nQuestions to\nYourself\nPolite\nDisagreement\nThe Mystique\nof Your Friends\u02bc\nLunch\ngirlfriend got pregnant and we didn\u2019t\nhave sex,\u2019 propping up daily on the\nhomepage.\nA quick look at any one of the many\nYouTube videos\u2019 comment section\nwould be enough to prove this.

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArrow: Season 2\nThe Amell family\u2019s sup\nJohn Park Television Editor\nThings were looking good for Starling\nCity and its masked vigilante hero at\nthe end of its highly successful first-season run. Tommy Merlyn (Colin\nDonnell) was crushed under a building (hurrah) leaving this less than useless individual to say his final parting\nwords to his best friend Oliver Queen\n(Stephen Amell) aka the Green Arrow.\nTommy\u2019s evil father Malcolm (John\nBarrowman) was also killed off (this\ndeserves another hurrah) although\nnot before setting off an earthquake\nmachine that destroyed a significant\nportion of the city leaving 500+ people dead. The only person they forgot\nto kill off was Thea Queen (Willa Holland), Oliver\u2019s immature little sister\nwith very few redeeming features. But\noh well, there\u2019s always room in season\n2 for more deaths in Starling City...\nright?\nBut Arrow is quickly looking to become a boring dull procedural the\nfirst season tried so desperately to\navoid. New additions to the cast aren\u2019t\nexactly working out, and isn\u2019t it about\ntime we tied up the loose ends relating\nto Oliver\u2019s 5-year absence storyline\non the mysterious Asian island? Yes,\nthat\u2019s where he went through rigorous\ntraining and became the buff superhero he is now. Do we really need to introduce more and more mastermind-like villains to fill up the time?\nAs season 2 opens, months have\npassed, and Oliver is sulking on the\nvery same island he spent his years\nin disappearance. Felicity (Emily Bett\nRickards) and John Diggle (David\nRamsey) come to bring him back to\nthe city, saying that they need him to\nrestore order and balance to a place\nwhere everyone is going mental following the disaster. His mother Moira\n(Susanna Thompson) is in prison\nhaving played an instrumental part\nin Malcolm Merlyn\u2019s plot, Thea\u2019s in\ncharge of Oliver\u2019s nightclub (urgh),\nwhere she\u2019s being actively sought after by a superhero-wannabe pretty\nboy Roy Harper (Colton Haynes) who\nwe know will end up as some sort of\na welcome sidekick but is taking a\nmighty long time to actually show us\nsomething impressive about himself.\nDetective Quentin Lance (Paul\nBlackthorne) has been demoted to a\nregular police officer, and his daughter Laurel (Katie Cassidy), a tough-as-nails lawyer who once used to work\nproviding legal aid to the poor is now\nat the district attorney\u2019s office, prosecuting criminals, whilst also holding\na grudge against Green Arrow for a\nreason that doesn\u2019t make sense and\nmaking it her life mission to track him\ndown.\nNone of the major characters are\nwhere we\u2019d ideally want them to be.\nOliver\u2019s a moody, hesitant hero who\nnow has a philosophy to not kill any-one, supposedly in an attempt to honour his memory of Tommy (huh?),\nLaurel is on a quest no-one wants her\nto be involved in (she should trade in\nher lawyer suits for a cop uniform because she can definitely hold her own\nagainst a fight), Diggle is as smug as\never constantly clashing with Oliver\non how to handle a situation, how\nMoira\u2019s not ended up dead yet in her\nprison cell is a mystery, Roy has potential although the writers are doing\nnothing to develop him in anyway,\nLance is and Thea\u2019s...breathing.\nTrapped in the flashback plot is\nthe younger version of Oliver Queen\nwho is quickly coming to grips with\nhis studies in martial arts and archery\n(yes we GET how he learned to fight -no need to take us back to the island\nevery single episode), as well as his developing romantic feelings for Shado\n(Celina Jade), a female warrior and his\ngrowing bromance with Slade Wilson\n(Manu Bennett)\nFun, bombastic action is no more,\nas Oliver finds himself in action sequences that are either too difficult\nto follow in all the smoke and darkness or are far too simple and generic\nto be truly enjoyed. He is a physically\ncapable fighter as everyone who\u2019s seen\nseason 1 knows, but his assets aren\u2019t\nbeing put to good use here. Gratuitous\nshirtless shots are shown like clockwork in every single episode, and\nfrankly it\u2019s a method that is getting\nquickly tiresome.\nOnly Felicity has her moments every\nepisode, as without her contribution\nthe vigilante wouldn\u2019t have a leg to\nstand on. He may wield a bow and a\nset of arrows that can do a variety of\nfancy tricks, but without her brains\nhe wouldn\u2019t even know where to start\nwhen it comes to catching the bad\nguys. Plus her not-too-subtle crush on\nOliver, one that will go on no further\nthan being a mere schoolgirl crush (let\nus hope), is often amusing to watch for\nsure.\nNot everything is a total disaster\nat the moment. With a new superhero in town (action heroine Summer\nGlau made a very brief appearance\nin an earlier episode of this new season - hint, hint), interesting dynamic\ncould be struck up between the two.\nWill they work together or will they\nbe on opposite sides? Only time well\ntell and the sooner Roy Harper suits\nup for action, the better, because all\nhe\u2019s doing now is handling luggage\nbeing Thea\u2019s new pet dog. And let\u2019s\nget on with Moira\u2019s trial and put that\nbehind us before the midseason finale,\nbecause a season-long legal battle is\nnot something audiences want to put\nup with in a superhero show. \u201cArrow\u201d\nhas certainly stumbled into the sophomore slump phase with its first few\nepisodes, but there is still hope left to\nsalvaging its reputation.\n\n"

Major corporations\nsend teams to scavenge the universe\nin search for more energy. Eventually,\nenergy is detected on planet 55001\nand to their astonishment they \ufb01nd\nin\ufb01nite energy crystals. Now you\nmust \ufb01ght for the planet\u2019s resources.\nGet your weapons and armour on and\n\ufb01ght for your CEO to make billions!\nYou use the [WASD] keys to direct\nyour player through various land-scapes, clicking on your mouse\nto \ufb01re against competition. The\ncontrols are simple and seamless.\nAside from your standard machine\ngun, various other weapons can be\npicked up around the landscapes.\nHealth packets also drop from the\nsky too! As you complete missions\nand earn money you can unlock\nmore crazy weapons including the\n\u2018slow gun\u2019 which gives you a shot at\nHitting enemies increases your\nadrenaline meter which can be used\n[space button] to slow down time\nin your perspective enabling better\nstamina and agility in real time. In\npractise, you tend not to really use it\nbut it\u2019s a fun plus for the gameplay.\nMissions range from single-player,\nteam Deathmatch, capture the \ufb02ag,\nterritory control to \u2018steal the orb\u2019. The\nmissions don\u2019t really adumbrate any\nstoryline which is a bit of a shame\nhowever the gameplay really makes up\nfor it. An extra challenge is added for\nthe most skilled gamers in completing\na level in a time limit to achieve a gold\nmedal giving you extra purchasing\npower for weapons and armour. Unfortunately, purchasing more expensive armour does nothing to your stats\n- the armour is just for design which\nI thought was a bit cheeky considering some of the price of the armour.\nAnother thing \u2013 the guns were small\nand it can be eyestrain sometimes.\nThey have tried to compensate the\n\ufb01eld of view of the map with the\nsize of the characters however I\u2019m\nnot convinced they\u2019ve captured the\ngolden balance. Some weapons are\na lot better than others so the weapon size can really be frustrating.\nGamers will really love the epic music in this game which pumps you\nup to achieve crazy killing streaks\nagainst your enemy AIs. One song\nto really look out for is Maze \u2013 the\nNightkilla and you can change the\nmusic whenever you are playing to\nyour liking with six songs in total.\nCustom battles can be unlocked by\ncompleting levels in the campaign\nmode and the di\ufb03culty of the levels\ncan be adjusted to the player\u2019s desires.\nYou also have the ability to give players in your team AI commands to follow you though this almost always did\nnot help with the mission or better the\ngame play. To have the ability to order\nyour AI team is quite awesome though.\nArmor mayhem is a must for all shooter games fans and as much fun it is to\nplay against other AIs this game will\nhugely bene\ufb01t from an online multiplayer addition where gamers can\nreally appreciate the engine\u2019s depth\nand appealing platform elements.\ncreating a time-altering zone to slow\ndown your enemies and kill\u2019em. And\nthe Halo inspired dart gun that \ufb01res\nmultiple homing darts that stick\nto the target and explode. Completing missions also unlocks new\nmaps with the di\ufb03culty of the missions\u2019 increasing into the game.\nWhen you, your buddies and your opponents health bar reaches zero they\nare automatically transported to a random place on the map after 5 seconds.\nPok\u00e9mon X & Y saw the \ufb01rst ever\nsimultaneous release of a Nintendo\ntitle worldwide. Combined with the\nfact that the encryption for the 3DS\nhas not yet been broken two years\ninto its release, this has been one of\nthe most exciting release of a Pok\u00e9mon game in several years, and spell\nextremely good news for Nintendo.\nIn the previous games, the Japanese\ngames would be released months in\nadvance of the other localised copies,\nand by the time the localised versions\nof the games are released, everything\nthat can be known about the game will\nhave been discovered, analysed, and\nplastered all over the fan-sites on the\ninternet. In addition, the ability to decrypt the games on the previous generation consoles (like the DS) meant\nthat hackers could dump the game,\nand data-mine the game in its entire-ty. This is how they can get the exact\nnumbers and percentages of many of\nthe mechanics you see on the various\nsites. They can even discover hidden,\ntendo kept a tight wrap on the things\nit revealed about the games. Even reviewers were barred from revealing\ntoo much about the games. About a\nnon-obtainable legendary Pok\u00e9mons.\nThis time, howev-er, things are di\ufb00erent.\nBefore the release of the games, NinYong Wen Chua on the beauties of a world wide release!\nweek before the games were due to be\nreleased, several retailers in Canada\nand Italy broke the street date by selling copies of the games early. Thus began a barrage of leaks about the games.\nIt was an exciting time to wake up\neveryday to a barrage of posts on\nsites such as reddit about the latest discovery of the games, whether\nit be of a new Pok\u00e9mon, discovery of a new mechanic, or even just\nshots of the new graphics. Even two\nweeks into the games\u2019 release, there\nare still new discoveries being made\nabout the game, including three\nunobtainable legendary Pok\u00e9mon.\nThe combined release of the games\nbefore the holiday season could also\nspell very good news for Nintendo\u2019s\n\ufb01nances. The 3DS has been struggling with its sales even two years\ninto its release. With the games selling 4 million copies worldwide (not\neven including the digital copies,\nand pre-orders) during the release\nweekend, this might just be the boost\nthat the 3DS needs. In fact, the 3DS\nexperienced a 99% increase in sales\nweek-on-week that very weekend.\nNow Nintendo just needs\nto do the same for the Wii U.\nAmore - not part of Armor Mayham\nImran Rashid\nGames Editor\nAttention all Halo fans, this is absolutely unreal!\nWin something\nFelix Games has 1 last copy\nof Awesomenauts, so do you\nwant grab this last copy while\nyou can?

    "content": "14 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nronyhasalwaysbeen,well,ironic.\nTake for example Aristophanes,\ngreat ancient Greek satirist\nof whom Nietzsche said \u2018that\ntrans\ufb01guring, complementary\ngenius, for whose sake one pardons\nall of Hellenism for having existed\u2019,\nand his play The Clouds. In a famous\nscene Socrates muses on the origins\nof clouds, their possible genesis in\nthe condensation of water vapour;\nthe clown then goes on to ridicule\nSocrates, because everybody knows\nthat the Gods give us clouds\u2026 The\nirony should be obvious to all of us:\nAristophanes\u2019 ironic and \u2018ridiculous\u2019\nexplanation, imputed to the sophistic\nand ridiculous philosopher, is of\ncourse the truth.\nPerhaps the above should be\nproposed as the actual logical formula\nfor irony, that is, a re\ufb02exive turn on\nirony itself. So take instead, a short\nsketch I heard on the radio the other\nweek. A man is listening to a program\nwhen he hears \u2018this painting is truly\niconic.\u2019 The man then goes on a rant\nto his partner: \u2018I hate the use of the\nword iconic. Everything is iconic\nthese days (etc.) Nobody seems to\nknow what the word iconic actually\nmeans!\u2019 The program then, rather\npredictably, goes on to say \u2018It depicts\nthe virgin Mary and Jesus Christ\u2026\u2019\nWhat this limp joke shows is that the\nsimple take on irony doesn\u2019t actually\nwork \u2013 irony requires two levels to be\ne\ufb00ective. Because the fact is here, the\njoke is not simply on the disgruntled\nold man from the joke, it is on the\njoke itself, because what the joke fails\nto see is that the man\u2019s criticism is\nsimply wrong. What the correct and\nproper use of language fails to capture\nis that the incorrect use is precisely\npart of the impartation of meaning.\nTake the word \u2018literally\u2019, as in \u2018I was\nliterally dying\u2019. The common sense\ncriticism, \u2018no, when you say literally,\nyou actually mean \ufb01guratively\u2019, misses\nthe point: it is through the disjunction\nbetween the literal meaning of the\nword and its usage that gets the\nmessage across.\nAnd this brings me to my real\npoint, the posters I have seen around\nImperial campus saying \u2018God\u2019s not\nDead \u2013 evidence for the existence of\nGod\u2019. Incidentally they remind me of\nanother failed joke, a line of gra\ufb03ti\nwith the lines \u2018God is Dead, Nietzsche\u2019\nfollowed by \u2018Nietzsche\u2019s dead, God\u2019.\nAlenka Zupan\u00e7i\u00e7 correctly points\nout that a funnier version of the joke\nwould be something like \u2018God is Dead,\nand actually I don\u2019t feel too good\neither\u2026\u2019\nMy initial reaction, and I suspect\nthe initial reaction of many, was \u2018How\nstupid. There is no proof that God\nexists, and if there were it would be\nself-defeating because God needs\nfaith.\u2019 This is of course the old Douglas\nAdams joke: the Babel\ufb01sh is so mind\nbogglingly useful that God must have\nmade it. This is proof for God so now\nwe can know, instead of having to\nbelieve, God exists. But without faith\nGod is useless, so God disappears\n\u2018in a poof of logic\u2019. But the true irony\nhere is double: there is no such mind\nbogglingly useful thing as a Babel\ufb01sh,\nso for Douglas Adams, perhaps God\nexisted after all; when God disappears\nin a \u2018poof of logic\u2019 does not Douglas\nAdams open up the space for people\nto believe in God again? After all, we\nmust recall that Wittgenstein\u2019s famous\n\u2018Whereof one cannot speak, thereof\none must be silent\u2019 that closes the\nTractatus was not an assertion of the\nimpotence of the that-which-cannot-be-spoken, but rather an assertion of\nthe sacrosanct nature of the super-linguistic (music, God etc.) If anyone\ndoubts this just think of the meaning of\nYou Know Who in Harry Potter. This\nis why I prefer the recent Pears and\nMcGuinness translation to the famous\nOgden one; the \ufb01nal line reads \u2018What\nwe cannot speak must be passed over\nin silence.\u2019 Here the religious element\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s thought is brought\nout fully (Passover/passed over). So\nwhen Douglas Adams kills o\ufb00 God,\ndoes he not really put him back in\nthe proper place for mystical divine\nworship?\nWhat should be noted is that,\ndespite the same conclusion reached\n(God can be worshipped), these two\nstrands of irony at work in Douglas\nAdams\u2019 joke (there is no Babel\ufb01sh;\nif God is killed by logic, God can be\nresurrected for spirit) are formally at\nodds with each other. This is why we\nshouldn\u2019t just dismiss the \u2018God is not\nDead\u2019 poster because without faith\nGod dies, Adams has shown that\nGod is a tougher cockroach than that.\nThis is why Dawkins always seems to\nmiss the point in his criticism, cogent\nthough it is. Neither is it correct\nto, as Nietzsche and the Romantics\nattempted, to adopt a heroic posture\nof anti-theological passion, with all of\nSatan\u2019s \u2018Evil be thou my Good\u2019 and so\non. This is clearly preserving the place\nof God by killing God o\ufb00.\nInstead our attitude to God was\nproperly described by Brecht. \u2018If you\nwere to \ufb01nd out tomorrow that God\ndoesn\u2019t exist, would anything change?\nIf so, then you have your answer. You\nalready need God. If not then stop\nworrying.\u2019 Or as Chomsky brilliantly\nput it, \u2018what exactly am I supposed not\nto believe in?\u2019\nAtheism and the Irony of Religion\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\n\u201cDawkins always\nseems to miss the\npoint in his criticism,\ncogent though it is\u201d\n\u2018Happy Belated Halloween!\u2019 Can I say that?\nAside from seeing scores of oddly dressed\npeople hanging around the Beit Quad while\ngetting back to the Felix o\ufb03ce on Wednesday\nnight, I have thankfully be saved from\nthe Halloween hype. Instead some truly\ninteresting things have happened this week,\nincluding the front page stories: the debate\nabout the government\u2019s Immigration Bill at\nUnion Council and the mischievous attempts\nof British Influence. The Immigration Bill is\nan interesting topic, while only a few parts of\nthe bill actually a\ufb00ect students, the measures\nthat are concerning have the potential to do\ndamage to the UK\u2019s international desirability\nas a provider of higher education. During the\nCouncil meeting there was a lot of debate\nlooking at both sides of the health measure\n(i.e. whether international students should\nbe charged an amount of money per year\nin order to use NHS services), however the\naccommodation measure was more uniformly\ncriticised, with many worrying about the\ne\ufb00ect that forcing landlords to carry out\nmore stringent checks on migrant residents\nmight have on the availability of private\naccommodation for international students\n(both undergraduate and postgraduate).\nHowever, another key event this week was\nthe release of the Imperial\u2019s new Education\nStudent Strategy, a document spearheaded\nby the Vice Provost of Education with the\nintent to improve feedback and transparency\nin College, while looking for ways to improve\nthe student experience. While some of these\nimprovements might be more long term, Felix\nlooks forward to the future improvements.\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nHalloween, Council\nand Education\nLetters\nDearest Felix Editor\nAs I sit here in my forest reading through the\nlatest issue of Felix I couldn\u2019t stop myself from\nspilling my Chamomile tea all down my best\nRobes. A response to my letter that actually\ncriticises my views and calls me irresponsible!\nOh Paladin you are obviously just jealous of\nme and all of Druid kind. I shall issue no such\napology for trying to bring the gift of Ice Cream\nto the Union. In fact I feel a kind of sadness\nthat your mind cannot cope with the beauty\nof the substance and so it causes you physical\npain. If you don\u2019t want to apologise to me for\ncausing me to have to make a trip to the lake\nto clean my robes, I suggest we partake in an\nepic battle of the minds. Here is one to start.\nI am thinking of a mysterious number that\nwhen multiplied by itself it is equal to double\nthe original number. Are you able to fathom\nwhat it is?\nThe Druid\nFELIX\nWho won? Who\nlost? You decide!\n\n"

Although putting a\nslight damper on things is the fact that\nthey can\u2019t actually kill. It\u2019s no fun for\nthem, and it\u2019s certainly no fun for us.\nBefore he figures out who he really\nis, Stephen Jameson (Robbie Amell)\nthinks he has a problem: he keeps\nhearing voices in his head, he can\u2019t fo-cus, and he\u2019s quite the wild child when\nit comes to school. But he soon discovers that he\u2019s a part of The Tomorrow People, individuals with specialised powers listed above, who are also\nhunted down by Ultra, a powerful government group that aims to neutralise\nsuch advanced mutants for fear of any\nmisuse of power or further mutations\nthat may enhance their abilities even\nmore. The Tomorrow People live hidden away underground actively trying\nto find new recruits before Ultra can\nget their evil hands on them, and it\u2019s\nlucky that John (Luke Mitchell), Cara\n(Peyton List), and Russell (Aaron Yoo)\nfound Stephen first, as he too, would\nhave faced a nasty ending.\nWhen it comes to portraying the\nthree T\u2019s that would be immensely\nuseful in everyday life, The Tomorrow\nPeople does have fun in incorporating\nthem to the expensive-looking action\nscenes. It\u2019s difficult to know how sustainable such scenes are on a freshman\ntelevision show\u2019s budget, but for the\ntime being it\u2019s fun to watch our heroes and villains zap their way around,\nusing their force field telekinesis and\ncommunicate through mind-reading\nand secret call-outs.\nPlotwise it echoes the beginning episodes of Alias and Nikita as Stephen\nends up as a double agent posing to\nwork for Ultra and its leader Jedikiah\nPrice (Mark Pellegrino) whilst secretly\nfeeding information to the good guys.\nIn fact there isn\u2019t a whole lot of secrecy when it comes to what everyone\u2019s\nthinking since everything is so clearly\nspelt out for the audience, and as with\nmost action/adventure/spy shows that\ngo down this route, it\u2019s hard not to\nwonder why the characters, especially\nthe antagonists, don\u2019t take the easy\nway of proceeding with intelligence.\nBut ultimately it\u2019s the good guys we\u2019re\nsupposed to be rooting for, so it\u2019s\nprobably a good thing the villains tend\nto ignore the best,j most obvious solutions available.\nNothing imaginative or original\ntakes place when it comes to charac-terisation: Stephen has daddy issues\n(is there a superhero who doesn\u2019t\nstruggle with this plot thread?), who\nabandoned the family leaving him\nwith his mother Marla (Sarah Clarke)\nand younger brother Luca (Jacob\nKogan). Time spent with his new\nbest buddies brings up questions as\nto Stephen\u2019s whereabouts, ones he\ndodges well whilst concealing his secret identity from his family and also\nfrom his best friend Astrid (Madeleine\nMantock). There is also a love triangle\nbrewing, something that no American\nnetwork television series can do with-out, especially the CW network aimed\nat young adults. Stephen begins to rely\nmore and more on Cara for advice, but\nit turns out Cara and John are something of an item. We all know where\nthis is headed and to be frank, it\u2019s not\nsomething that\u2019s particularly worth\nlooking forward to.\nMost problematic however, is in\nthe leading man, the other Amell, the\nyounger cousin of Stephen Amell,\nwho is certainly generous with the\namount of time he spends showing off\nhis toned physique (another requirement for a show like this), but when it\ncomes to actually selling the plot, he is\nno way near as convincing as he should\nbe. He is too awkward and somewhat\nrobotic in his delivery, and as a lead\nthis is possibly the most disappointing\nperformance of this television season.\nThings take an absolute turn for the\nworse when he has to multitask - running and acting it seems, is too much\nof a stretch, and the awful narration\nthat is a shameless copy of what they\nhave been using on Arrow doesn\u2019t help\nsmooth things over either.\nThe supporting cast is noticeably\nbetter: Mitchell and List do a good\njob, Yoo is an adequate comic relief,\nand Pellegrino is as devious and evil\nas he has been in many other shows\nin the past.\nWithout a doubt the strongest appeal here is the potential in its action\nscenes. But there is angst coming. The\nshow\u2019s still young, and with some minor tweaks here and there, a lot of fun\ncould be had in this silly but entertaining concept. Less talking (especially\nfrom Robbie Amell), more action will\nbe what saves this show, although the\nnumbers this is posting aren\u2019t looking\ntoo great in its time slot.\n\n"

    "content": "4 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nFEATURES Editors: VACANT\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nEarlier this week Felix caught up\nwith Professor Debra Humphris,\nVice Provost (Education) and had a\ndiscussion about the new Education\nand Student Strategy that was released\non Thursday.\nFelix: So, you\u2019re releasing the\nEducation Student Strategy\ntomorrow?\nYes. I started it in December last year,\nwe started the process of engaging\nsta\ufb00, students and alumni in thinking\nabout an Education Student Strategy\nto give us a framework and a set of\nactions to continually enhance and\ntake forward our education student\nexperience. So having gone through\na consultation process, having got\npeople\u2019s great ideas, having honed that\nhopefully into a green paper. Having\ngone back to the community to say:\n\u201cWhat do you think of this? What are\nyour comments? Having read all of the\ninput and having events with students\nand with sta\ufb00 town hall meetings,\nwe then arrived at this Education\nStudent Strategy, which went to what\nwas formerly the Management Board\nback in June, and has then been to\nProvost board again just to double\ncheck. And then over the summer\nwe\u2019ve been working to set up working\ngroups around speci\ufb01c actions, so\nwe\u2019ve now got a framework for action\nfor the college and so that all goes live\ntomorrow on the website.\nSo what we\u2019ve tried to do with the\nwebsite is have a website where\nyou can click and you can get to\nthe information. We\u2019ve put it there.\nWe\u2019ve put links to other sources\nrelated to particular actions. We won\u2019t\ndo everything all at once because\nthere\u2019s too much to do all at once.\nSo, hopefully it\u2019s both a repository\nof information about what\u2019s going\non. It should also be a two-way\nformat in terms of people who want\nto highlight great ideas, because the\nworld\u2019s moving at such a pace: people\nwho want to get involved, people\nwho\u2019ve got views about particular\ndevelopments. It\u2019s got to be a two-way\ndialogue.\nF. So, what was there beforehand,\nwas there anything at all before you\nstarted this back in December?\nThe College has always had a strategy.\nIf you go back to the 2010-14 strategy\nthere are some higher-level strategic\nambitions in there about education.\nThere\u2019s really helpfully an issue about\nperformance: that the College should\nbe in the top three of all the leading\neducation indicators, which, if you\ntake that and apply to say the NSS,\nthat\u2019s really challenging, and so what\nI hope I\u2019ve done with this is get a bit\nmore focused and set out some really\nspeci\ufb01c pieces of work that we need\nto do. So back in 2009 there were\nno MOOCs [Massive Open Online\nCourses], there was no plan on the\nhorizon about (as we knew it then) for\nthe rise in undergraduate tuition fees.\nSo much has happened just in that\nperiod, a strategy has got to be a living\ndocument.\nF: So, are you planning on\nincorporating changes as more\nfeedback comes in from people?\nSo for example, there\u2019s a workgroup\nwith a commitment to streamline and\nrationalise surveys, so that every time\nwe ask you a question as a student\nyou should know what we do with\nthat, what we\u2019ve found, and what\nwe\u2019re doing as a consequence. I\u2019m\nof the view that less is more, fewer\nsurveys followed up more diligently\nand reported back in terms of\nactions is probably more worthwhile\nthan thousands of surveys that you\nnever hear\u2026 that\u2019s not valuing your\nfeedback. So, that group has started\nand undoubtedly there will be changes\nthat will come along that we\u2019ll need\nto adapt to, there\u2019s a national review\nof the NSS, so we don\u2019t know what\nwill come out of that next year. So,\nyou have to keep these things live\nand responsive, but you have to set\na direction and start getting on with\nsome really speci\ufb01c actions.\nF: So, it is very easy for people to give\nfeedback, is that via the website?\nYes, so there\u2019s going to be one email.\nSo for every action there will be a page\nthat you can click through to \ufb01nd out\nabout.\nSo if you take this one about \u201cSupport\nstudents to return to their schools and\ncollege and employers to share their\nexperiences of college.\u201d So this came\nfrom Lewis, a student in Earth Science\nwho said we should do more of this\nbecause it really works for kids and\nteachers and schools. And actually,\nwe like to go and tell our story. So,\nLorraine Craig, who started this o\ufb00\nin the school of Earth Sciences, has\nkindly agreed to lead that group. And\nwhat we\u2019re going to do is gradually\nincrease this because we must do it\non a quality basis, its no good sending\n900 students back to their schools. We\nalso need to think about the schools\nthat we focus on because if this about\ninspiring the next generation, there\nare some schools where we could\nprobably could do a bit more of that\nthan in others, so we need to connect\nthat up with our outreach. \u2026 So on\nthe webpage, we either click on that,\nand that will take you to a page which\nis just about that action. You\u2019ll be able\nto \ufb01nd out who\u2019s involved, terms of\nreference of the group, what progress\nthey\u2019re making and any links to other\nsources, keeping people looking out\nthe window. \u201cActually this is really\ngood that we do this, but actually\nhave you seen what the University of\nXYZ does? We could be doing that.\nSo, under each of the four objectives\nthere will be links to all the actions so\nthat you can \ufb01nd out anything that\u2019s\ngoing on and there will be an email\nwhere anybody who\u2019s got an idea or a\ncomment, and those comments (as in\nthe consultation) will range from the\nhighly supportive and encouraging\nto the\u2026 more colourful and more\nanatomical.\nF: Oh dear.\nWell, you know all of life is here.\nF. So one thing that I\u2019m picking up\nis that you\u2019re very keen on making\nit transparent and easy. Is this\nsomething that would be possible to\nget throughout all college?\nYes, this is a college-wide strategy, this\nis the framework we\u2019ve set all College.\nThe job now is to engage everybody\nin the community, sta\ufb00, students, and\nalumni to help put their shoulder to\nthe wheel and move us forward.\nF: Personally I think that with some\nof the issues you\u2019ve raised, especially\nthe NSS, it\u2019s important that we focus\non things and make them better\ninstead of just complaining which\nis what some students currently do\nat times. So in terms of boosting\nstudent morale, what are your\nthoughts in regards to that?\nSo, through all of this, what I\u2019ve been\nreally clear about (and actually there\u2019s\na statement right at the beginning [of\nthe document]), are the underpinning\nassumptions around this. This strategy\nis built on three assumptions, one is\nour disciplinary strength in science\nand engineering and our commitment\nto a research-led education that is\npractice-based. Another assumption\nis a clear commitment to strong\npartnership with Imperial College\nUnion, we do this and we do this\ntogether, and the recognition that\nthe educational experience of our\nstudents is shaped by all members of\nthe college community: sta\ufb00, students\nand alumni. How Mrs Patel at the\nstudent hub speaks and deals with\nyou [and treats you] is as important\nas professor \u201cWonderful Wonderful\u201d\ngiving her lecture on molecular\nsomething or other. We are all one\ncommunity and building that respect\nfor everybody\u2019s contribution is really\nimportant. Everybody has brilliant\nideas, I don\u2019t know anybody who\ncomes to work at Imperial College\nnot wanting to do a great day\u2019s work\nand I would be mad to shut o\ufb00 a route\nInterview: Introducing the\nEducation and Student Strategy\nby which people might say \u201cDo you\nknow what, I had a really great idea,\ndo you know that we can do X, Y, and\nZ\u201d. Genius, you can\u2019t see the wood for\nthe trees, so engaging people is really\nimportant.\nF: Almost wrapping up, looking\nforward to the future, both in terms\nof this document and future strategy\ndocuments, is there a particular\ntimeline that we can look at for\nchanges, and then for the future,\nwhat are you thinking?\nSo, again, in January the College will\nstart the process of refreshing it\u2019s\ncurrent strategy (it will probably be the\n2014 to 2020 strategy), so we\u2019ll start\nthis process and this will get wound\ninto it because essentially we\u2019ve done\nthe education and student piece. We\nmight refresh it on the way, I wouldn\u2019t\never rule that out, and then these\nactions will take di\ufb00ering amounts\nof time. So in terms of the education\nforesight process, the challenge I\u2019m\ngoing to put before colleagues is: Let\u2019s\nthink now about the 2020 graduate\nintake, because they are alive. What is\nit we\u2019re going to be delivering in 2020,\nwe\u2019ve got MOOCs, we\u2019ve got \u2018digital\u2019,\nwe\u2019ve got interdisciplinary research\nand disciplines merging, challenges\nall over the world, increasing\nglobalisation of higher education,\nthree-year olds who do this [mimics\na touchscreen gesture] and think that\ntelevisions [are touchscreen]. What\nwill they be like when they arrive in\n2020? How do we prepare for that?\nAnd we need to have a vision about\nthat because if we\u2019re going to start the\nwork to get there we have to start now\nbecause we haven\u2019t got many years left\nto get to that point.\nF. OK. One last question. Is there\nany particular part of the strategy\nthat you\u2019re really keen on, or is it\nthe whole thing? Is there any one\npriority?\nNo, I think it wouldn\u2019t be in here if\nit wasn\u2019t important to the college.\nFor me, it\u2019s all important, it\u2019s about\nstudents, it\u2019s about there experience,\nit\u2019s also about our sta\ufb00 and it\u2019s about\nthe infrastructure and creating the\nenvironment to which to deliver\nworld, so you can\u2019t have one bit on it\u2019s\nown.\nF. OK. Well, thank you very much\nfor your time.\nFelix talks shop with the Vice-Provost Education\nProfessor Debra Humphris, Vice Provost (Education) FELIX\n\n"

As a\nmember of the press via my website,\nI was invited and given a press pass.\nThe whole day was a very surreal\nexperience, basically being treated like\na member of royalty as each exhibitor\ntries to get your attention. For the\nkeynote I got to use the special press\narea! (The front row in other words!)\nBeing sandwiched between reporters\nfrom The Guardian and TechRadar\nwas an interesting experience to say\nthe least!\nSteve Wozniak was de\ufb01nitely\ntrying to encourage us to be better\nat creating successful technology\nstartups. With the rise of kickstarter\nthis was de\ufb01nitely portrayed to\nus as the best time in years to\nstart your own business venture.\n\u201cThe bigger a company is the slower\nit changes, people who buy apple\nproducts want Apple like products.\nAny product which doesn\u2019t \ufb01t into\nthe Apple ideals is not the Apple\nway, you know whether its apple\nor not. This goes back to the day\nwhen Steve [Jobs] introduced the\nMacintosh. In the 1984 commercial\nwe were the new guys, [now that we\nare established] you can\u2019t take Apple\nin totally new directions. This gives\nsmaller companies an advantage in\n\ufb01nding the smaller areas of the market\nor come up with radical new ideas.\u201d\nHe then went to explain how apple\ndeveloped quickly. \u201cMarketing is the\nmost important thing [in establishing\na new business]\u201d Woz then explained\nto us how it was easy to grow at \ufb01rst\nbecause the media like reporting on a\nbusiness with a great idea who started\nfrom their garage. When Apple\nbecame a larger company the media\ngot bored and left us, at this point it\nwas hard to make an impact and only\ndue to some great commercials like\nthe 1984 they would have gone under.\n\u201cAt HP they turned down my\nideas [for a PC] 5 times.\u201d To be a\ngreat business leader you need to\nrecognise a good idea when you see\none. \u201dAt HP we were only building\ntools that engineer\u2019s use. We, the\nengineers were the experts.\u201d As such\nthe engineers came up with ideas\nwhich were largely ignored by HP.\n\u201cThen Steve and I started Apple, we\nweregoingtobeverymarketorientated\nvery subject to the end user even\nwhen you are running on zero dollars.\u201d\nThis enabled us to create completely\nnew product targeted towards\nconsumers rather than businesses.\nHe then continued on to explain\nhow important he thinks engineers\nare in turning a good idea into\nreality, and even improving it. \u201cIf\nyou are businessman please \ufb01nd the\nengineers. Engineering is so di\ufb03cult\nand they think of things to improve\nyour own product idea. Give it time\nto gel.\u201d Engineers think of new ideas,\n\u201cOddball ideas that don\u2019t pop into\nother people heads will come to\nyou.\u201d In producing and designing the\nproduct; \u201cExcellence is absolutely\nimportant. I\u2019ll improve the graphics\netc. give it a second try make it better.\u201d\nEven though he had just lectured\nus for quite a while on building\na good business he claims; \u201cI am\nnot a businessman, I\u2019ve certainly\nhad start-ups on my own, and I\ninvest when I like the idea in terms\nof an engineer not whether it\ncould or could not be pro\ufb01table\u201d\nIf all else fails you can always\nprint your own cash. Steve started\ndoing this with a friend, and\nsomehow it is perfectly legal to\nuse it in a shop, I can\u2019t see how,\nand he didn\u2019t properly explain it.\n\u201cI nearly got arrested once and\nread my rights, but I got out of it\u201d \u201cI\nsometimes sell a sheet of 14 dollars\nfor 8 dollars to random people in\nthe street\u201d. Apparently they are\n\u201cSecret Service approved bills.\u201d\nBesides focussing on business we\nlearnt a few thing about Steve, the\nmost surprising of which is that he\nopenly criticised the new iPad Air as\nnot suiting his needs. \u201c I called my wife\nand told her I wasn\u2019t getting a new one,\nI was disappointed with the 128GB\nmaximum storage\u201d Furthermore\nhe told us that \u201cthe iPhone could do\nwith a much larger screen, probably\naround \ufb01ve inches.\u201d Furthermore to\nthat he said that Apple had taken\nthe \u201cwrong direction by changing\nthe aspect ratio of the iPhone,\u201d this\nwas followed by a large cheer from\nthe crowd made up of nearly entirely\ndevelopers who must have agreed!\nHe then proceeded to tell us that he\ndoesn\u2019t have home broadband, and\nonly has a T1 line (1mbit/s). It takes\nhours to download a movie, and by\nthe time I\u2019ve downloaded it I don\u2019t\nwant it anymore.\u201d In fact we learnt that\nonly movie worth downloading and\n\u201cwatching about Apple is Pirates of\nSilicon Valley, although they didn\u2019t get\neverything right, I really enjoyed it!\u201d\nSteve\u2019s currently spending most\nof his time on various projects such\nas FusionIO and other start-ups and\nvisiting places around the world.\nApple\u2019s New Keynote and What it Means for You\nMaximilian Eggl\nTechnology Editor\nA\ns mentioned in last\nweeks news bubble\nApple had a key note\nlast tuesday. That\nday con\ufb01rmed most\nrumours on the internet as well as\nsome pleasant surprises. However\nif you are looking at the news,\nscratching your head and wondering\nhow this will a\ufb00ect anything in your\nlife, read on dear reader and all shall\nbe explained!\nLet\u2019s \ufb01rst talk about the new\niPads. These two updates to existing\nproducts had been predicted several\nweeks ago, so no big surprises their.\nFurthermore rather than these devices\nbeing revolutionary, they are more\nevolutionary than anything, but I bet\nyou heard that clich\u00e9d phrase before.\nHowever more so than recent years,\nthese iterations actually did get some\nserious upgrades. Before we start\nanything though, let\u2019s just clear up\nthat the new name for the big iPad\nis the iPad Air, which considering its\nnew weight and thickness is actually\nquite a good name. It seems this is an\nattempt by Apple to create more of\na link between their macbook range\nand their tablets (maybe we might\neven see a combo device some day!). A\ncomplete redesign for the bigger iPad\nhas seen it lose half a pound as well as\n24% of its overall volume. At this point\nit really just seems to fall in line with\nthe minimalist design that Ive so loves.\nThe mini also got an upgrade by\nreceiving that retina display, that\nshould have been included in the \ufb01rst\nMini. However with 4 times the pixels,\nthis display should be a real beautiful\nto look at and fall in line with the high\nstandard that all other apple products\nfollow.\nThe inclusion of the 64-bit A7 in\nboth the Air and the Mini will lead to\nsome serious speed increases, which\nshould make that graphic design/\nmusic production/gaming that much\nmore smooth.\nNow the big question, should you\nsplash out? Well that really depends, if\nyou are in the market for a new tablet\nand are willing to pay the premium\n(\u00a3399 for cheapest iPad Air, \u00a3319 for\nnew iPad Mini), I would seriously\nsuggest going for either the Mini or\nthe Air. If you have just gotten the\nlast iPad it may be more prudent to\nwait, as the high price does not really\nwarrant what you are getting in terms\nof new stu\ufb00.\nThe other big thing of this keynote\nwas Mavericks. While everything\nnew in mavericks has been discussed\nin a prior article, the pricing was\nnot. Therefore one of the pleasant\nsurprises of the keynote was the\nfact that Mavericks (Apple\u2019s newest\nupdate of its operating system)\nwould now be free. Previously these\nthings usually cost about \u00a320, which\ncomparing to the price of windows is\na steal. However if you consider how\nmuch Apple really makes from their\nOS, they may as well make it free. Its\na great way to lure in new customers,\nand hopefully all new updates will be\nfree. Therefore if you have an eligible\nMac, you may as well update as you\nwill get some nice new features (love\nthat extended battery life)! However\none little caveat. I found that my Mac\nslowed down a bit after the update,\nso for all you out there with older\ndevices, I would suggest to you to\nmaybe wait a month or so, until all the\nlast bugs are worked out and the OS is\nfully optimized!\nThe last little thing I want to mention\nis the price of Apple\u2019s equivalent of\nO\ufb03ce. It is now also free of charge.\nYes, dear reader you read correctly,\nit costs diddly squat. If you consider\nhow much money Apple really makes,\nthe amount they make from their\nsoftware is like a drop in the ocean.\nTherefore this strategy of o\ufb00ering\npages, keynote and numbers for free is\nquite a smart strategy. However, and\nhere comes the disadvantage, is that\nthis price only applies to new devices!\nHow devious of Apple!\n\n"

He directed Coney\nto the Union\u2019s many political societies,\nsaying that they are \u201cmore able to\ncampaign on political issues if it falls\nwithin their aims and objectives as a\nsociety\u201d.\nWhile British In\ufb02uence seemed\nto be satis\ufb01ed with this response, a\ndisgruntled senior Union o\ufb03cer, who\nwishes to remain anonymous, has\ncon\ufb01rmed to Felix that they passed on\nthe text of the original email to Paul\nStaines \u2013 a controversial right wing\nblogger and columnist better known\nby the pseudonym Guido Fawkes.\nStains subsequently wrote about the\nissue in his regular column in the Sun\non Sunday, prompting widespread\ncriticism of British In\ufb02uence on social\nmedia. Steve Crowther, the UKIP\npart chairman, has been reported as\nhaving requested that the Charity\nCommission investigate the incident.\nBritish In\ufb02uence has played down\nallegations of impropriety, telling\nStaines that \u201cthis was just a clumsily\nworded email\u201d. At the time of going to\nprint the Union had not released an\no\ufb03cial statement.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nReporter\nBritish Influence approaches the\nUnion to make a stance on UKIP\nT\nhe second meeting of the\nUnion Council was held on\nTuesday, October 29. The\nmain issue of discussion\nwas the Union\u2019s response\nto the government\u2019s Immigration\nBill 2013-2014. Proposed by Home\nSecretary Theresa May on October\n10 the Bill had its second reading on\nOctober 22 and is expected to pass\nthrough parliament and receive royal\nassent early next spring. The Bill is\nof potential concern to international\nstudents since it would require them\nto pay a minimum fee of \u00a3200 a year\nto use non-emergency NHS services\nand would place a legal obligation on\nlandlords to check the immigration\nstatus of their tenents \u2013 potentially\nbiasing them against international\nstudents.\nIn a paper for the Council, Union\nPresident David Goldsmith wrote that\n\u201cinternational student fees contribute\na vast amount to supporting the UK\nhigher education system\u201d, quoting\n\ufb01gures from the Department of\nBusiness, Innovation and Skills that\nstate that, in 2012, \u201cinternational\nstudents contributed \u00a37.9 billion to\nthe UK economy\u201d. Goldsmith claimed\nthat the Bill was poorly researched \u2013\nciting the discrepancy between the\n\u00a3200 million to \u00a32 billion that the\ngovernment estimates is spent on\nhealthcare for international students\nand the \u00a333 million \ufb01gure cited by\nthe NHS itself. He went on to add\nthat he believed that \u201cthe bill would\ndiscourage international students\nfrom applying to institutions such as\nImperial College, thereby reducing\nfunding\u201d and called for the Council\nto vote \u201cto oppose the \u2026 proposals\nset out in the immigration bill\nby arranging meetings with local\nrepresentatives and campaigning with\nthe student body\u201d.\nWhile some members of the\nCouncil expressed the opinion that\ncontinued on page 3...\nFEDERICO GAMBARINI/EPA\n\n"

No longer content\nwith being the mother\nof all procrastination\ntechniques (in the\nbattle of lab report against the entire\nseries of Gossip Girl, there can only\nbe one winner) and bringing in the\ninternet streaming revolution, the\nAmerican website has started showing\noriginal content available exclusively\non Net\ufb02ix. The \ufb01rst test subject in\nthis experiment was political drama\nHouse of Cards, which proved an\nuncontested success when it went\non to be nominated for nine Emmys,\nincluding Outstanding Drama series.\nFollowing this, when the cult US\ncomedy Arrested Development was\ncancelled by Fox, Net\ufb02ix bought\nthe rights and revived it for a fourth\nseries, to the great delight of fans\neverywhere.\nNo wonder, then, that Net\ufb02ix saw\n\ufb01t to continue this winning streak\nby commissioning more original\ncontent to show. Orange is the New\nBlack is the latest of these and is, so\nfar, the most successful yet. This may\ncome as surprising, as it\u2019s the type of\n\u2018risky\u2019 show which is probably unlikely\nto be picked up by one of the major\nAmerican networks, given that it\u2019s an\nadult drama with an almost entirely\nfemale cast, set inside a women\u2019s\nprison.\nThe show follows the adventures\nof Piper Chapman, a white, well-educated, middle-class woman, as\nthe newest inmate in a New York\nfederal prison. During a couple of\n\u2018experimental\u2019 years after graduating\nfrom college, Chapman decides to\ntravel Europe with her lesbian, drug-dealing lover, who asks her to smuggle\n$50,000 of drug money into Belgium.\nThe consequences of the crime don\u2019t\ncatch up with her until ten years down\nthe line, when Chapman, now settled\ndown with an Adam-Sandler-lookalike\n\ufb01anc\u00e9 and making artisanal bath\nproducts for a living, is sentenced to\n\ufb01fteen months in prison. Interestingly,\nthe series is based o\ufb00 a true story: the\nsource material for Orange is the New\nBlack is a memoir written by author\nPiper Kerman, detailing her time in\nprison after pleading guilty to money\nlaundering for her then-girlfriend.\nAlthough trying to see the silver\nlining in the jail sentence (\u201cI\u2019m going\nto get ripped,\u201d she announces to her\nboyfriend before departing, \u201cand read\neverything on my Amazon wishlist,\nand maybe even learn a craft, you\nknow?\u201d) Chapman is about as ill-prepared for prison as anyone is likely\nto be. From the strip search upon entry\nto the repulsively seedy male prison\nguards, this is a world completely\nunfamiliar to that which she has come\nfrom. The parallels between the two\nworlds are highlighted in \ufb02ashbacks\nto Chapman\u2019s pre-prison life; after\naccidentally insulting the inmate chef\nand consequently being starved out\nat every mealtime, she \ufb02ashes back\nto the hunger she felt during a juice\ncleanse detox programme. And as if\nlife in prison couldn\u2019t be bad enough,\nChapman\u2019s misery is compounded\nwhen she discovers her ex-girlfriend,\nthe source of all her troubles, is\nanother new inmate.\nThe supporting cast of characters\nare one of the best things about\nthe show. Each episode shows the\nbackstory of how a particular inmate\ncame to be there, an invariably tragic\nstory, whether it be aiding illegal\nimmigration, or stealing money to\npay for gender reassignment surgery.\nThe show also doesn\u2019t gloss over\nthe brutalities of prison life, such as\nracism or sexual assault. There\u2019s plenty\nof lighter moments, though - a leaving\nparty for one of the soon-to-be-ex-prisoners, the hairdressing salon un by\ninmates and the friendship between a\nyoga instructor and a nun, to name a\nfew.\nOrange is the New Black has one\nof the most diverse casts you\u2019re likely\nto see on TV at the moment. The fact\nthat the show\u2019s female characters\nspan a broad range of ethnicities,\nsexualities, and socio-economic\nclasses shouldn\u2019t be note-worthy,\nbut, compared to similar shows out\nthere with similar target audiences,\nit is. Each character is written with\nauthenticity and respect, leading to\nsome thought-provoking questions\nabout the viewers own internal biases\nand preconceptions.\nStill wondering whether to give it a\ngo? If you want to see one of the best\nrepresentations of women currently\non TV, this show is for you. If you\nwant a sensitively-handled critique\nof America\u2019s War on Drugs, it\u2019s for\nyou. Or, if you enjoyed Prison Break\nbut felt like it could have done with\nmore lesbians, then it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely for\nyou. Either way, Net\ufb02ix has put all of\nthe \ufb01rst series up at the same time,\nso you don\u2019t even have to wait a week\nbetween episodes; a second series is\nalready in the works as well. If Orange\nis the New Black is at all indicative\nof the quality of TV in the internet-streaming, post-television world, long\nlive the revolution.\nNETFLIX\nNETFLIX\n\n"

In school, when I was\nlearning to drive, my Physics\nteacher told me that he wished\nthat we were in Saudi Arabia,\nwhere women are banned from\ndriving, because then at least I\u2019d shut\nup about it in his lessons. I remember\nbeing outraged to learn this, and it\u2019s\nalways stuck with me. While I would\nabstain from describing driving as a\nbasic human right, it\u2019s certainly not a\nright that should be awarded based on\ngender.\nAccording to the 2013 Global\nGender Gap Report, Saudi Arabia\ncomes in at 127th out of 136 countries\nin terms of gender equality. Despite\nminor \ufb02uctuations, their score has\nimproved more than any other Middle\nEastern and North African region\nsince 2006. However, it remains the\nlowest performing in the group of\nhigh-income countries. Education\nfor women has improved drastically\nover the last few decades, with rates\nof women enrolling in post-secondary\neducation now being higher for\nwomen than for men. A quota for\nthe number of women in parliament\nhas been introduced, meaning that\nit is now made up of 20% women. In\n2011, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz\nal Saud declared that women would\nbe eligible to stand and vote in the\n2015 local elections, and as of August,\ndomestic violence is now a criminal\no\ufb00ence. However, despite all these\nimprovements, the gender gap index\nscore remains far lower than other\ncountries of similar GDP, global\ncompetitiveness index, or many other\ncomparable factors. While progress is\nbeing made rapidly in Saudi Arabia,\nthere is still a long way to go.\nIn opposition to these changes,\nSaudi Arabia remains the only country\nin the world to place a ban on women\ndriving. This is seen largely as a result\nof the culture, not any religious laws,\nand indeed, neither national tra\ufb03c\nregulations nor sharia law explicitly\nprevent women from driving. Instead,\nwomen cannot obtain licences, and\npolice are advised to remove keys\nfrom any women drivers, and issue\nthem with a warning.\nSheikh Saleh bin Saad al-Lohaidan,\na conservative cleric and judicial\nadvisor, has recently gone on record\nas saying that women who drive are\nmore likely to bear children with\nclinical problems as the act of driving\n\u201cautomatically a\ufb00ects the ovaries and\npushes the pelvis upwards\u201d, which\nsounds like something that The Onion\nwould report. The 2013 March of\nDimes global report on birth defects\nshows Saudi Arabia coming in second\nhighest out of all countries listed,\nwith 81.3 birth defects per 1000 live\nbirths. With many birth defects being\nattributed to environmental factors\nand inadequate prenatal care, this\nseems to suggest that banning women\nfrom driving should not really be their\nbiggest concern when it comes to\nreducing this.\nOn October 26th, many women\ntook to their cars, and posted videos\nonline of themselves driving in\nvarious cities. In contrast to similar\nprotests in 1990 and 2011, there have\nbeen no reported arrests following\nthese demonstrations. According to\nactivists leading the campaign, the\nattitude of Saudi men towards women\ndriving is changing, seeing the ban\nas no longer in line with a country\nwhere 17% of the native workforce are\nwomen. The lack of enforcement of\nthe ban throughout these protests also\nseems to indicate a changing mood\namongst the government in terms of\nlifting the ban. King Abdullah has said\npublicly that women will drive one\nday, but Saudi authorities are quoted\nas saying that \u201csociety is not ready\u201d, a\nview seemingly de\ufb01ed by the social\nmedia response and the vast number\nof signatories on the petitions to allow\nwomen to drive.\nAttitudes towards gender equality\nare changing in Saudi Arabia, and\nwith global support, it can only get\nbetter. There is still an awful lot of\nimprovement yet to be made, but it is\nhappening, and quickly. The success\nof these protests would be a huge\nleap in terms of women\u2019s freedoms in\nSaudi Arabia. Although it may not be\nthe biggest discrimination that they\ncurrently face, it has been described\nI\nf there is one thing the our\nUnion has got right is its ability\nto generate endless of amounts\nbureaucracy and su\ufb00er a\nconstant stream of changing\nindividuals \ufb01lling roles without much\nof an idea of what they\u2019re supposed\nto be doing or even being quali\ufb01ed to\ncomplete their role.\nAnyone who has experienced the\nhours of endless joy that is Union\nCouncil is well aware that things can\nbe a right shambles. Our current\nconstitution was replaced last year\nwith little consultation using a\ntemplate that was designed by the\nNUS despite our own Union having a\nrather more completed legal standing\nas de\ufb01ned in the Imperial College\nCharter (the Union may or may not be\na separate legal entity).\nIn fact the sweeping changes\nbrought in by the new constitution\nare so radical that the body charged\nwith advising on the impact of\nconstitutional changes, the Union\nCourt (which was abolished as part\nof the changes) provided a report\ndetailing some of the issues with the\nproposed constitution which was\nlonger the constitution itself.\nAnyone at this week\u2019s Council\nmeeting would have seen a lengthy\ndebate about the Government\u2019s\nImmigration Bill which culminated\nwith the \ufb01nal decision being that we\ncouldn\u2019t make a decision at the time\ndespite numerous good proposals\nthat addressed peoples points being\nproposed, while aware that prompt\naction was needed if the Union wished\nto actually accomplish anything\nregarding the bill.\nIf there is one thing that does help\nkeep the Union running from day to\nday it is the team of approximately 50\nemployed professionals that actually\noversee the running of the Union\nbehind the scenes. These people\nactually have a vested interest in\nseeing the Union be successful. Some\nindividuals who are familiar with how\nthe Union operates often refer to the\nSabbatical o\ufb03cers as puppets.\nDespite the issues with the new\nconstitution, changes were needed.\nTalking about the old arrangements\nof the Union\u2019s government the Chair\nof the Trustee Board, Dame Julia\nHiggins, said that the Union\u2019s \u201csystems\nwere \ufb02awed and failing in governance\u201d\n(Union Council Minutes 30 October\n2012).\nAside for the issue of a constant\nchanging team of individuals\nwith oversight of the Union and\nits activities, the fact that these\nindividuals are selected by a popularity\ncontest means that it is often not the\nbest individual that gets the post. Yes,\nwe run a College wide ballot and, yes,\nwe have some the best turnout for\nthe \u201cBig Elections\u201d but if you actually\nlook at voter turnout for most of\nthe other roles in the Union e.g. the\nmembers of Union Council (the board\nresponsible for keeping oversight\nof the Sabbs and Trustees as well as\nbeing \u2018the representative body\u2019 of the\nUnion) the turnout is depressingly\nlow and the result is dramatically\ne\ufb00ected by the popularity of the\nindividual running. So when you then\nthink about who actually runs for the\nposts of Sabbatical o\ufb03cers its almost\nalways the people who have been\ninvolved the Union and hence got in\nthough being popular. The number\nof times I\u2019ve heard people complain\nthat \u201cactually none of the candidates\nfor this Sabb role are any good\u201d is far\nto high to be consistent with the idea\nof the elections being the best way of\nappointing people for the posts and\nsystem of governance working for us\n\u2013 how many of you have complained\nabout, or tried to do something with\na club society or project simply to get\ntied up in endless amounts procedural\nmatters?\nSo what\u2019s my solution? Well simply\nto have become to Saudi women what\nthe seat on the bus was to Rosa Parks \u2013\na symbol of a more subtle oppression.\nJonathan Peek on the warpath\nwhat we need is for people who\nwould actually make good o\ufb03cers\nto take an interest in the Union, and\nwe (as a voting body) need to vote\nfor the person who would actually\nbe best rather than who we know\n\u2013 unfortunately this requires less\nvoter apathy and actually an election\nprocess that prompts informed voting.\nThe good news is that we do have\nat least one basic test as part of the\nelection process: if you haven\u2019t written\na manifesto or uploaded a photo then\ngood luck trying to beat RON.\nJonathan Peek\nAnonymous\nek\n\n"

Klee emphasises and\ndevelops on colour, then content, or\nshape, and experiments with elements\nof most art movements of the time.\nMore than \u201cjust\u201d Klee, you get your\n\ufb01x of fauvism, cubism, abstraction,\nsymbolism, surrealism and even\ncaricature. All in one go, Klee style.\nKlee has the qualities most Imperial\nstudents can empathise with:\nmeticulous precision, dedication and\na constant striving for innovation.\nFrom descriptions of the works you\nget a sense of his extensive cultural\nknowledge and constant fascination\nwith the world around him. Klee\u2019s\npassion is further shown by his\ninnumerable technique developments,\nas well as his dedication to teaching.\nKlee worked for it, but makes it look\nso fun and easy. That\u2019s admirable.\nThere are a few take home messages.\nIf you\u2019re the type who likes to pick\nup that brush once in a while, this is\nMUSEUM FOLKWANG, GERMANY\nKamil McClelland vistis the world\u02bcs \ufb01rst\ncontemporary African art fair\nI\nlove contemporary African art.\nRaw talent exists throughout\nthe continent of colour and\nexuberance, but a pitiful lack of\nfunding leaves the majority of\nit undiscovered. However, with its\nnewly burgeoning economies, a tidal\nwave of new and exciting art from the\ncontinent is about to hit us, with all\nthe force and vitality of the dazzling\npieces themselves. Africa is the\nplace to be looking in years to come.\nAnd with El Anatsui\u2019s huge tapestry\nTSIATSIA \u2013 Searching for Connection\ntaking pride of place in the Royal\nAcademy\u2019s courtyard for this year\u2019s\nsummer exhibition, it seems the wave\nis already beginning to lap against our\nshores.\nThis October, 1:54, the world\u2019s \ufb01rst\ncontemporary African art fair, brought\ntogether works from across all 54\nAfrican countries to the beautiful\nsetting of Somerset House. Described\nas \u2018the most signi\ufb01cant cross sectional\ninsight into art from the continent\never seen\u2019, it aimed to break new\nground and reveal this little-known\nart scene to the wider world in all its\nglory. It most certainly achieved this,\nwith 15 di\ufb00erent galleries exposing the\neclectic mix of art that Africa has to\no\ufb00er.\nThe fair deliberately came to\nLondon during Frieze to gain\nmaximum exposure and publicity for\nan art market with a lack of funding,\ninfrastructure and, unfortunately,\nin\ufb02uence. Being only the \ufb01rst art fair\nof its kind, one must look more at its\npotential for the future as opposed\nto its current state of infancy. And\nthere was de\ufb01nitely a mood of great\noptimism and possibility amongst the\ncurators, patrons and artists that were\nwondering between gallery spaces.\nHowever, it really was telling\nthat the fair was unable to secure\nthe continent\u2019s leading galleries,\nGoodman and Stevenson of South\nAfrica, which were already exhibiting\nat Frieze. Moreover, with only 15\ngalleries at the show, you felt it a bit\nlacking in material, especially when\ncompared to both the PAD and Frieze\nfairs on that week. Such a shame,\nconsidering the quality of work that\nwas gathered, such as those displayed\nby The Museum of Modern Art,\nEquatorial Guinea, which does not yet\neven have a physical gallery space back\nin its home country.\nI really had no idea what to expect\nfrom 1:54. Contemporary African\nart can seem so impenetrable to an\noutsider due to our lack of exposure\nto it. One cannot help but feel excited\nwhen this world, completely unseen to\nmost, is suddenly revealed and in such\na spectacular manner. Many of the\nworks derived their in\ufb02uences from\nthe African art that came before them;\nthe textiles, the sculpture, the masks\nthat had such a profound e\ufb00ect on the\nlikes of Derain and Picasso at the start\nof the 20th century. However, it puts\nit in a context that we can understand,\ntackling subjects like urbanisation\nand the issues that accompany it, to\ngive but one example. This creates a\ncollection that is both challenging and\nnew yet at the same time strangely\naccessible and recognisable.\nIn a way I don\u2019t particularly like\nthe term \u201cAfrican Art\u201d. It places all\nthese works, made in cultural settings\ncompletely discreet from one another,\nunder one umbrella. How can the work\nof Cyprien Tokoudagba, which gives\nus insight into Benin\u2019s spiritual world,\nbe put alongside The Last Judgment\nby Zimbabwean Richard Mudariki,\nwhich addresses politics, censorship\nand greed? It creates an impossible\njuxtaposition that runs throughout the\nwhole of the show.\nDespite this, it almost feels necessary\nfor works from across Africa to be\ndisplayed in this way. I feel a uni\ufb01ed\nidentity is what African art needs right\nnow, with a single African voice. The\nart of individual countries is not well\nenough established to be represented\njust by itself, and so an African identity\nallows it to be seen and acknowledged\nby the wider world. And for a visitor\nlargely ignorant of the diversity of\nAfrican art, it o\ufb00ers an opportunity\nto dip one\u2019s feet into this unexplored\nocean with minimal e\ufb00ort.\nIt is di\ufb03cult to summarize what\nwas on display at 1:54 but pieces\ngenerally were able to convey the\nentrepreneurship and powerful zest\nfor life emanating from this young\ncontinent. Many looked at con\ufb02icts\nthat have arisen between cultural\ntraditions and a modern world of\nconsumerism, where everything\nis disposable. Romuald Hazoum\u00e8\nwittily reinvented African masks out\nof recycled plastics and synthetic\nhair \u2013 as if that is what the modern\nhuman has become \u2013 as opposed to\na gorgeous piece of carved wood, the\ncultural norm.\n1:54 is full of surprises, especially\nwhen you compare the cost of some\nof the innovative and dynamic pieces\non display to the six-\ufb01gure sums you\ncan expect at mainstream events like\nFrieze. To be able to pick up a work\nas deeply emotional as Amahigu\u00e9r\u00e9\nDolo\u2019s expressive charcoal and kaolin\npieces for only \u00a3800 is virtually\nunheard of in the art world, and an\nopportunity any buyer would be a fool\nto let pass by.\nBecause of this, I see a promising\nfuture for this fair, especially with\nthe Tate and Saatchi Gallery having\npurchased some of the works on\ndisplay here. Despite its issues, I\nbelieve it will play an important role\nin the burgeoning popularity of the\ncontemporary African art market \u2013 for\nit solves the problem of the scattered\nand decentralized art scene on the\ncontinent, by scouting the art from it\nand taking it to the rest of the world.\nThis year\u2019s show felt more like an\nopportunity to discuss the future of\nthe African art market, as opposed to\na comprehensive display of what the\ncontinent has to o\ufb00er \u2013 something\nthe fair organisers were quite happy\nto admit. Instead, they see this, as I\ndo, as a great step forwards in making\nthe vitality of Africa\u2019s art culture an\nundeniable fact on the world stage.\nA visitor at \u201cthe most signi\ufb01cant cross-sectional insight into art from the African\ncontinent ever seen\u201d\nde\ufb01nitely the place for inspiration\n\u2013 Klee\u2019s techniques are simple and\nexplained well enough to try out back\nat home. When reading the displayed\ntext, you get an understanding of\nthe historic and art-historic context.\nImpressive fellow artists and the\nhistoric turmoil of the early 20th\ncentury adds depth of understanding\nto the paintings you see.\nThe collection culminates at\nKlee\u2019s best. All the elements Klee\nexperimented with earlier seem to be\ncombined, his style found: meticulous\nprecision, bold lines, symbolism and\n\ufb01tting colour. The large, thought\nprovoking paintings of Klee\u2019s later\nlife manage to re\ufb02ect both Klee\u2019s\ndeteriorating health as well as the\ntroubling political development. You\nget the feeling Klee had this last,\nurgent necessity to leave behind a\nmessage. Never aggressive, never\nopenly criticising, the art of his\nlast years is not as light-hearted as\nprevious works, but it does quite\nclearly express concern, anxiety and\nurgency.

The effect this had on his\nfuture career is debatable, however\nspeaking in 1996 Reed recalled:\n\u201cThey put the thing down your\nthroat so you don\u2019t swallow your\ntongue, and they put electrodes on\nyour head. That\u2019s what was recommended in Rockland State Hospital\nto discourage homosexual feelings.\nThe effect is that you lose your memory and become a vegetable.\u201d\nIn the early 1960s, whilst studying at Syracuse University, Reed immersed himself in experimental free\njazz and doo-wop of the 1950s. He\nwould use these influences to devise\nAMS album of the week\nCut Copy stated on the standout track of\ntheir previous album, \u201cBlink and you\u2019ll miss a\nrevolution\u201d.Theoneandahalfyearsthathave\npassed since then are, in the big scheme of\nthings,ablink.TheAustraliansynthpopquar-tet now return with their fourth album Free\nYour Mind, which whilst not quite a revolu-tion, is certainly a revelation. Bad puns aside,\nFree Your Mind will take you a on a nostalgic\njourneytolate80sacid-house.\nThis album saw the band take\na new approach to writing music, with frontman Dan Whitford composing the foundations of a new song every day for four months. He then took his creations back to\nthe band to piece together the album. To push their sound to new psychedelic levels,\nproducerDavidFridmann(Tame Impala/Flaming Lips)wassoughtoutformixingduties. When the product was polished, the launch of the album was teased by erecting\ngiantbillboardsinavarietyofexoticlocations;Mexico,Australia,Chile,and(obviously)\nWales.Andwhatdidthesebillboardssay?Well,FreeYourMind,ofcourse.\nThosegiantbillboardsemphasizethestatementthebandistryingtomake:FreeYour\nMindisn\u2019tsimplythetitleoftherecord;itistheethosthattheywantlistenerstoadopt.\nThe band themselves describe the album as a \u201cfantasy of the next youth revolution\u201d,\ndrawing inspiration from the cultural explosions birthed from the fallout of the VietnamWarandthereignofMaggyThatcher.Thisfeel-goodvibeofliberalhedonismruns\nthrough the record. Its effect on your mood can be staggering. And whilst listening to\nit hasn\u2019t converted me into a fully-fledged hippy, I do feel more predisposed to buying\n\u201ctie-dyed\u201dproducts.\nThe album kicks-off with the title track, and you can\u2019t help but compare the sound to\nPrimal Scream - the rhythm is locked into the stabbing keyboard chords and there are\nvocal samples that shriek early 90s house. From this point, the album traverses different dance environments. There are more mellow moments (\u2018Dark Corners & Mountain\nTops, Walking In The Sky), and some more obvious dancefloor classics (\u2018In Memory\nCapsule\u2019, \u2018Footsteps\u2019). I\u2019m not a huge fan of the use of the short linking tracks, but oh\nwell, by the time my current favourite - \u2018Meet Me In The House Of Love (DAT SAX)\u2019comesonI\u2019mtoobusydancingtocare.\nFormethough,FreeYourMinddoesn\u2019treachthesamedizzyheightsastheir\npreviousrecord,Zonoscope.Thisisprobablyduetothefond,drunkenmemoriesIhave\nof dancing along to those tracks when I caught the band at Bestival, a few years back.\nI\u2019ll have to catch them on their next tour. Oh, and one important piece of advice if\nyou\u2019re going to see them - don\u2019t forgot your dancing shoes.\nCut Copy \u2013 Free Your Mind\nLee Sewell\nsical lyrics. Reed\u2019s work was many\ntimes hailed as the pre-curser to\npunk, however the tenderness that\nhe portrayed in his vocals set him\nfar apart from anything that filled\nthe grimy, sweat-drenched bars of\nLondon and New York over the following decade.\nDrugs and alcohol were major\nthemes throughout much of his\nlife, with the album Berlin attesting\nto that. Of his drug-taking he once\nsaid:\n\u201cI take drugs just because, in the\n20th century, in a technological age\nliving in the city, there are certain\ndrugs you have to take just to keep\nyourself normal like a caveman, just\nto bring yourself up or down.\u201d\nHe eventually beat his demons\nwith drugs, replacing them with\nT\u2019ai Chi. However, they eventually\ncaught up with him when earlier\nthis year his health rapidly deterio-rated, forcing him into a liver transplant operation. Following the op he\nproclaimed to be stronger than ever.\nUnfortunately this did not last and\nReed passed away on 27th October.\nFifty seven years after Reed underwent shock treatment, New York\nCity and attitudes towards sexuality\nhave changed markedly. Lou Reed\ncould claim to have played a part\nin both, however the effect he had\non his many fans is what will live on\nfondly in people all over the world.\nguitar techniques that would underpin his playing style for decades. In\n1964 Reed caught the attention of\nsome industry bigwigs by recording a song parodying dance music at the time, and playing it on a\nguitar with all strings tuned to the\nsame note. Through this he was introduced to John Cale who would\nfound The Velvet Underground with\nhim. 1967 saw the Velvet Underground release their most famous\nrecord: The Velvet Underground\nand Nico, but by 1968 the band had\nbegun to crumble. Frustrated at the\nlack of success they were receiving\n(The Velvet Underground and Nico\nreached 171 in the billboard chart)\nand due to differences over the direction of the band, Cale left. Shortly afterwards Reed followed suit and\nbegan pursuing a solo career.\nReed\u2019s 1972 record, Transformer, was\nthe peak of\nhis commercial success.\nThanks partly to working\nwith David\nBowie, his\nmusic was\nexposed to\na whole new\naudience that\nloved the dis-tortion-laden\nguitar and\nthe gritty, almost unmu-Lou Reed\u2019s Life\nwas lucky enough to get\nthe chance to see Jake\nBugg last Thursday at one\nof his three sold out gigs\nat the O2 Academy in\nBrixton. I\u2019m only familiar\nwith a handful of his songs, so I\nwas actually quite surprised by his\nperformance as a musician, singer\nand songwriter. Some people say\nhe lacks charisma whilst perform-ing, but I think they are confusing\nthe word charisma with arrogance.\nJake Bugg isn\u2019t the kind of artist who\nneeds to jump around the stage or\nsmash a guitar to grab the audience\u2019s\nattention; his music does that for\nhim. Ok, so the only times he spoke\nin between songs were to thank\nthe audience or to introduce the\nnext song, but like the majority of\nthe other audience members, I was\nthere to enjoy his musical talent and\nthat I certainly did.\nJake started with a few of his\nwell-known songs such as \u2018There\u2019s a\nBeast and We All Feed It\u2019 and \u2018Seen\nit All\u2019. The energy was great, with the\ncrowd loving every minute. The set\nwas simple, Jake standing with his\nguitar and support from a bassist and\ndrummer. The lighting was cool; the\ntheme of the song and overall ambience was changed depending on what\ncolour lights were used. The venue\nitself could have been nicer, but then\nagain as soon as the place is dark you\ncan look past the dirt and general\nbadly maintained d\u00e9cor (mainly because you can\u2019t actually see it). Half\nway through the gig Jake began to\nintroduce songs from his new album,\n\u2018Shangri La\u2019. The weirdest thing was\nhow di\ufb00erent his singing voice is to\nhis speaking voice, probably why he\ndidn\u2019t talk much. The \ufb01rst song he\nplayed from the new album was \u2018Pine\nTrees\u2019, one of his more mellow songs.\nThis was followed by \u2018Song About\nLove\u2019 and \u2018Slide\u2019. The tone was soon\npicked up again though when he performed \u2018Greenman\u2019 and another one\nfrom his new album, \u2018Kingpin\u2019. By this\npoint most people were up dancing or\nsimply swaying along. Of course, the\none Jake ended with had to be the infamous \u2018Lightning Bolt\u2019, the song that\nkick started his career. There wasn\u2019t a\nsingle person who wasn\u2019t up on their\nfeet, a great way to end the gig!\nIf you\u2019re looking for a chilled\nnight of music, then de\ufb01nitely go see\nand see Jake Bugg. Even if you don\u2019t\nknow many of his songs, you will\nbe wanting to listen to more of him\nby the time you get home. The best\nthing about Jake is the fact that he\ncan perform a wide range of music,\nfrom the fun upbeat songs, to the\nslower more relaxed ones. Coming\nfrom Nottingham he\u2019s been described\nas an East Midlands Dylan, although\nto most he would probably be recognised as a product of the last 20 years\nof British guitar pop.\nIt\u2019s refreshing to see artists like\nJake Bugg around, he is entertaining\nand talented, but the fame hasn\u2019t got\nto his head and probably won\u2019t any\ntime soon. Unlike other overrated\nartists such as One Direction, he\u2019s a\ngenuinely modest guy and I expect\nhe will do pretty well in the future if\nthe preview from his new album is\nanything to go by. Going from playing the BBC Introducing stage at the\n2011 Glastonbury Festival to selling\nout all of his London shows at the age\nof 19 is pretty amazing.\nJake\u2019s new song \u2018What Doesn\u2019t Kill\nYou\u2019 is out now on iTunes and his\nalbum Shangri La is to be released\nNovember 18.\n\n"

Anyone considering\ngoing into this avenue of \ufb01nance after graduation should seriously consider giving this\nbook a read to gain some insight into what\nkind of work and lifestyle you can expect.\nThe long hours, never ending assignments,\nhigh \ufb01gure deals, fat pay cheques, coveted\nbonuses and sleeplessness you can expect\nare neatly summed up in these fast paced\nand insightful accounts.\nThey two authors both worked for a\nreputable New York investment \ufb01rm for a\nnumber of years following graduation from\nIvy league business schools. Their stories\nunfold chronologically from starting business school, to getting summer internships,\nthen contracts and full time \u2013 and one really means full time \u2013 positions. Their experiences allows for a wider discussion of\nhow the industry itself works, and its place\nin the modern economy. I myself have some\nfriends who went into this line of work and\nam now \ufb01nally able to understand why it is\nI never see them, and just what they get up\nto all day (and night) long.\nOf course one should acknowledge that\nthe book was written in the \ufb01rst place due\nto the both the authors leaving the industry\nthrough disillusionment. Their colleagues\nwould probably argue they were burned\nout, though they would counter that they\nhad \ufb01nally come to their senses. In spite of\nsuch bias the authors are able to provide\na true and fascinating account the inner\nworkings of investment banking, a profession few people really understand but are\nnevertheless all too ready to have an opinion on.\nThe book is now a decade old, but still\nmeticulously encapsulates what new recruits to investment banking can expect.\nReading extracts to a friend of mine who\nlives this world made him laugh out loud\nat the way his job was being described. Not\nbecause the book was wrong however, but\nbecause his job was being summed up with\nequal measures of accuracy and vitriol. This\nsame friend has told me of his ninety hour\nweeks, regular all nighters, cocaine frenzies and the masochistic way in which he\nis managed. When I question him on why\nhe puts up with some of the more pointless\ntasks he is set, which only seem to serve the\npurpose of gratifying his line manager rather than accomplish anything productive\nfor the company, he explained that I didn\u2019t\nunderstand how the \u2018food chain\u2019 works. Imagine my delight and surprise when turning\nto chapter six and \ufb01nding it was in fact entitled \u2018The Food Chain\u2019.\nI\u2019m now in a position where I both understand such aspects of this industry, and\nyet don\u2019t understand them, which is a better position than where I was previously.\nThis e\ufb00ectively sums up the book, in that\nit provides an insight into the goings on of\ninvestment banking, and the very personal\nand casual way in which the authors\u2019 lives\nare conveyed allows one to appropriate the\nmindset and motivations of those drawn to\nsuch a life (spoiler alert, it\u2019s mostly greed).\nWhat was quite unusual about this book\nthough, was that it was written by more\nthan one person. There are always two voices throughout the book, the story unfolding from two perspectives, with each one\nhaving their own typeface.

Much of the\nbook is focused on this relationship, as well as a more\ngeneral exploration of the nature of love. The Doll how-ever, is also a far more complex work \u2013 while the love affair plays out in the foreground, the background presents\nus with a profound and fascinating exploration of Polish\nsociety in the late nineteenth century. As in many of his\nother writings, Prus was ruthless in exposing the oppression and unfairness in the world he lived in, and is meticulous in examining its causes. The many subplots and\nthemes of the novel come together seamlessly to form a\ncompelling study of human nature \u2013 and the cruelty and\nsel\ufb01shness that is inherent within it.\nThere is much in this work that reminds me of Dickens\n\u2013 however I have always preferred Prus.

To\ndiscourage abandonment of children,\nthe government has more recently\nbegun to set up day centres for\ndisabled children. Our volunteer\nwork was at one of such centres.\nAt Gorna Day Centre, the children are\nseparated into two groups by age. The\nyounger children range from age 2 to\n10.Theolderchildrenare10andabove.\nWhile working there we found that\n\u201cdisability\u201d is a \ufb02exible term: there was\na wide range, including cerebral palsy,\nDown\u2019s syndrome, autism, and ADHD.\nUnlike many of the orphanages that\nICAB works with, the Day Centre\nwas well-equipped with toys, and\neven had a functioning playground.\nThe sta\ufb00, however, were untrained\nand unenthusiastic, so the children\nwere often left to amuse themselves.\nThe toys were left to collect dust\non a tidy shelf, out of reach. This is\nwhere we stepped in. Our role was\nto organise activities for the children\nand provide them with much-needed\ncare and attention. It was a challenge\nto overcome both the language and\ndisability barriers. It was also di\ufb03cult\nto tailor the activities to the children\u2019s\nindividual needs and abilities.\nWe organised a music day with\nukuleles, keyboards and several\npercussion instruments. They enjoyed\nit more than we thought they would,\nand kept asking us for the \u201cguitarra\u201d for\ndays after. On another day we brought\nsome clay to the centre: it was great\nfun encouraging the children to work\non their manual dexterity through\nplay and we even managed to learn the\nnames for some animals in Bulgarian!\nWhen we were not working at the\nDay Centre we had time to explore\nthe local town and nearby areas. It\nis a place where lovers of nature,\nhistory and culture can all be satis\ufb01ed.\nOn one of our days o\ufb00, we decided to\nclimb a nearby hill known as the Rock.\nOur hike began on a wide concrete\npath with a seemingly gentle incline.\nAs we got closer to the top, it changed\nfrom a smooth concrete road to a\nsteep and slippery dirt path. Indeed,\nit could barely be called a path. We\nonly knew we were going the right\nway because it was up and because\nof the faded arrows spray-painted on\nthe trees. When we \ufb01nally reached the\ntop we were soaked (Mother Nature\nhad decided to bless us with rain),\nsweaty and muddy, but it was worth\nit. The view atop the Rock was breath-taking. We could see the surrounding\ncountryside for miles around. It\nwas a little bit dizzying, actually. No\nhealth and safety precautions here!\nWe also visited Arbanasi, a pretty\nvillage with many historical buildings,\nmainly churches and monasteries.\nIt\u2019s also where Bulgaria\u2019s rich and\nfamous live (according to our travel\nguide, anyway). We\u2019re not sure if\nwe saw any Bulgarian celebrities,\nbut we did see a coach belonging to\nFC Ariston, a local football team!\nThe whole trip was impeccably\norganised and better than we could\nhave imagined. Bulgaria is a place\nmany people don\u2019t normally consider\nand it isn\u2019t somewhere you would\noften associate with volunteering.\nIt is an unspoilt beauty and the\nchildren there are in real need of\nlove, care and attention, which it\nwas a privilege to provide. We would\nrecommend it to anyone. It\u2019s relatively\ninexpensive and, more importantly, it\nis an incredibly rewarding experience!\nChildren rocking out on \u201cguitarras\u201d at Gorna Day Centre\nBulgarian bliss: spend your days off unwinding in beautiful countryside\nGet involved with ICAB\nVisit: facebook.com/ICAidToTheBalkans\nEmail: ICAB@imperial.ac.uk\n\u2026Or attend one of ICAB\u02bcs upcoming events:\nMonday 11/11 @ 6:30 p.m. in Reynolds R2 (Charing Cross)\nTuesday 12/11 @ 6:00 p.m. in SAF 121 (South Kensington)\n\n"

Unfortunately\ncaptain Clarke couldn\u2019t \ufb01t him into\nthe team in place of the technically\nsuperior Deasy, and he was forced to\nwatch from the stands.\nA distinctly non-cagey \ufb01rst 10 minutes\nsaw IC getting in behind the RUMS\nfull backs and creating a whole host\nof chances. A lack of clinical \ufb01nishing\nhad already caused the 5\u2019s downfall\nin previous games, and nerves began\nto show as RUMS started to get into\nthe match. With 25 minutes gone,\nNicholls \ufb02ashed a header across the\nface of goal from a wicked Aguilera\nin-swinging corner \u2013 showing the\nworld that her left foot is miles\nbetter than her vocal ability. Minutes\nlater another set piece delivery from\nAguilera dropped to Deasy 6 yards\nout, who \ufb01ercely struck the ball\ntowards goal. Unfortunately for him,\nfull back Krol was too busy applying\nfake tan and considering his latest\nmodelling contract to get out of the\nway, duly blocking it on the goal line.\nThe loose ball was cleared to the edge\nof the box where Clarke was lurking\nto ri\ufb02e it into the top left hand corner.\nDespite the 1-0 advantage IC took\ninto the half time break, the team\nwere insistent that the score line was\nstill 0-0. Yet it wasn\u2019t long before a\nNicholls free kick sent to the back\nstick was nodded across goal by Clarke\nand, after pinball in the 6 yard box,\ntucked past the keeper by late call up\nStilwell. Stilwell then turned provider\nfor IC\u2019s third, sending a corner high\nand long where Rowley gambled\nmarvellously at the back stick to \ufb01zz\nhome a classy \ufb01nish on the volley.\nAfter his goal line block earlier in\nthe game, Krol had the chance to\nredeem himself as the ball fell to him\na yard out from another menacing\ncorner. Getting his shoulders back\nand lifting his head are two things\nthat might look good on camera, but\nneither of them helped him here as\nhe blazed the ball well over the bar\nwhen it was probably easier to score.\nA brief scare followed this as Klottka\nand Yeoh\u2019s o\ufb00side trap was broken\nfor the \ufb01rst time by the RUMS centre\nforward. Having not seen the ball all\ngame, however, his touch was rustier\nthan Grant Holt\u2019s treadmill, and the\nonrushingHaas-Hegere\ufb03cientlydealt\nwith the danger. Minutes later, another\nhopeful long ball was cleared again\nby the German keeper, only for him\nto collide with the RUMS number 9.\nUnlike in recent history, it was the\nGerman who came out on top as he\ncontinued to play on, despite being\nout by a factor of 4 when asked how\nmany \ufb01ngers he could see in front of\nhim. The centre forward whose elbow\nhe had aggressively head-butted\nbizarrely limped o\ufb00 the \ufb01eld despite\nno clear damage to either leg, and\nwith no remaining substitutes RUMS\nwere forced to play on with 10 men.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before their distinct\nlack of footballing ability was made\neven more apparent by the missing\nplayer, but the ferocious Sang Woo\nwasn\u2019t happy with just the one man\nadvantage as he looked to stamp his\nimpact on the game. Eventually good\ninterplay down the right hand side\nfrom the tireless Han and man of\nthe match Aguilera led to substitute\nPetersen bearing down on goal and\nslotting the ball home to seal the\nresult. After such a comprehensive\nand e\ufb03cient victory, not even the lack\nof post-match treat could dampen the\nspirits of the players as they returned,\ntriumphant, to West London.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\nICUAFC\nCricket: Imperial\nlose to UCL\nOn Saturday 26th October, Imperial\nCollege 1st XI travelled to the University of East London\u2019s SportsDock\ncentre to play in the \ufb01rst round of\ngames of the BUCS Indoor Tournament. Our \ufb01rst game was scheduled\nto be against LSE but our opposition forfeited the game, handing us\nour \ufb01rst points of the competition.\nWhilst this was a positive start, it\ntook away the opportunity for vital\nmatch practice going into the second \ufb01xture of the day, against UCL\n1st XI.\nImperial won the toss and elected to\n\ufb01eld \ufb01rst, in order to gauge an idea\nof how to approach the run chase,\nand UCL got o\ufb00 to a relatively quick\nstart, scoring 47 o\ufb00 4 overs. But, due\nto a disciplined bowling e\ufb00ort from\nMohit Kulkarni, Zain Rizvi and Vinay Babla, UCL were not able to\naccelerate at the end of the innings,\nlosing their last 3 wickets for 0 runs,\nand \ufb01nishing with an average score\nof 104 o\ufb00 their 10 overs.\nDuring the interval, captain Vignesh\nVenkateswaran spoke about the\nneed for a sensible approach towards\nthe run chase, as the total was not\ndaunting in any respect. However,\nImperial got o\ufb00 to the worst possible\nstart with Vishal Nair being bowled\no\ufb00 the \ufb01rst ball of the innings. Imperial then lost incoming batsmen\nMohit Kulkarni for 1 and Zain Rizvi\n(6) soon after that. It then took a\ncaptain\u2019s e\ufb00ort from Viggy (25) to\nsteady the ship, together with Juhin\nPatel (19) and soon Imperial needed\n35 runs o\ufb00 the last 2 overs, a gettable\ntarget given the indoor scoring sys-tem, but unfortunately the last wicket fell soon after this, which meant\nImperial conceded defeat to UCL by\n31 runs. A disappointing result for\nImperial, especially given the talent\nwithin the team, but we will come\nback strongly for the next round in\nlate November, hopefully with some\nmore experience under our belt.\nResult:\nUCL 104-6 beat Imperial 73-6 by 31\nruns.\nZain Rizvi\nIndoor Cricket Team Member\n\n"

It\ngot me thinking about all the key\nemployability skills that have had\nto be used today to remain up and\nrunning and providing a service to you\nguys. Problems have been reviewed,\nsolutions put in place, changes\ncommunicated to students and team\nmembers briefed. All this from just\nthe \ufb01rst hour at Imperial this morning!\nAll these key transferable skills came\ninto play during one short period on\na Monday morning, just think what\ncore skills you can develop over the\ncourse of your studies and use to\ngreat e\ufb00ect in your future applications\nfor employment or internships and\nplacements!\nAs you settle back into the College\nacademic year you are no doubt\nbecoming aware of the myriad of\nevents that the Careers Service\narranges to help you come to a career\ndecision and to set you on the pathway\nfor a rewarding and ful\ufb01lling career.\nNo matter what route you choose to\npursue after completing your studies,\nwhether to remain in academia or\nto go into the world of work, either\nthrough an internship or by entering\na graduate training programme- you\nwill undoubtedly have to go through\nsome form of selection process.\nFor many this can seem daunting\nbut the key to success is giving\nevidence of what you can o\ufb00er and\nimportantly how you have been\ngaining valuable transferable skills\nduring your studies. Employers are\nlooking for a well-rounded future\ncolleague. They can see you have the\nacademic quali\ufb01cations, but how can\nyou show them you have all the skills\nand behaviours that they are looking\nfor? Often when I speak to students\nthey do not fully appreciate what\nthey have to o\ufb00er and overlook key\nskills they have developed or will have\nobtained by the time they graduate.\nSo, what do we mean by transferable\nskills? Transferable skills are a key set\nof attributes that employers require\nfrom you. As you review opportunities\neither on line via Jobslive (http://\nwww3.imperial.ac.uk/careers) or\nfrom company websites, you will\nsee job descriptions and person\nspeci\ufb01cations for di\ufb00erent roles. Time\nspent reading and understanding\nthe requirements for any role is time\nwell spent. Obviously you will need\nto pay attention to the academic\nrequirements for the role, but what of\nthe other aspects that you will most\nlikely see.\nAre they asking for communication\nskills, time management skills, team\nworking skills, problem solving skills,\na positive \u2018can do\u2019 attitude, and so\non? Any application, whether for\na Graduate level role, internship\nor higher level study will require\nyou to fully assess what you have to\no\ufb00er. To succeed our job is not to\ndiscount areas that you have solid\nexperience in or undersell yourself.\nThose reading your applications will\nwant good evidence of your skills.\nIt is not enough for example to say,\n\u201cI\u2019m a good communicator\u201d, you\nneed to say where and how you have\ndeveloped these skills. For example\nthis could come from group projects\nyou are undertaking as part of your\ncourse. How many people are in the\ngroup? Are you aware of cultural\ndi\ufb00erences? Do you listen to others\nand propose solutions? Do you\nactively involve others in the group\nand so on. Already, by expanding on\none aspect, communication, your\nresponse to application questions or\nlaid out on your CV really comes to\nlife. This enables the reader to start\nto gain a more detailed picture of you\nand how you might be able to use\nthe communications skills you have\ndeveloped.\nYou will have lots of opportunity to\ngain these key transferable skills while\nat Imperial. These can come from\nwork and experiences you are gaining\nthroughout your studies or from your\nextracurricular activities from clubs\nand societies.\nSo, where might you start to look for\nevidence of your transferable skills?\nThe table is just a starting point but\nby thinking these areas through you\nwill start to identify more as you really\nthink about what you have to o\ufb00er.\nIf you are unsure how to interpret\nyour skills in the best possible way\ndon\u2019t forget you can get help from the\nCareers Service by booking to see one\nof our Careers Consultants.\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/careers\nMore than getting a degree: developing\nyour key transferable skills\nCareers Service\nImperial College\n\n"

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Grandmaster\nDirector: Kar Wai Wong\nWriters: Kar Wai Wong, Jingzhi Zou,\nHaofeng Xu\nStarring: Tony Leung Chiu Wai,\nZhang Ziyi\nRuntime: 108 minutes\nCertification: PG-13 (USA)\nFred Fyles\nStar Writer\nThe Grandmaster cut up by Weinstein\nIt has been a difficult couple of\nmonths for Harvey Weinstein. As well\nas recutting his documentary of J.D.\nSalinger after it was savaged in reviews,\nheisnowengagedwithargumentswith\nthe directors of both Grace of Monaco\nand Snowpiercer over his liberal\nuse of editing that has earned him\nthe moniker Harvey \u2018Scissorhands\u2019.\nAnd so it is perhaps unsurprising\nthat he seems a little defensive when\nhe goes up alongside BFI director\nClare Stewart to introduce this year\u2019s\nSurprise Film - The Grandmaster by\nlegendary auteur Wong Kar-Wai. \u2018We\ntried to keep it as chronological as we\ncould\u2019, Weinstein explained \u2018but at the\nend of the day, who gives a shit?\u2019. Oh\ndear. What follows is 100 minutes of\ncinema that - although beautiful - is\noff paced, confusing, and a little bit\ndisappointing.\nI first feel like I should point out that\nwhat we are shown is the American\nedit, made for Western audiences, that\ncuts the original film down by about 45\nminutes, while adding in a number of\nscenes not in the original. It would be\nunfair to Kar-Wai to pretend that this\nwas his original vision for the project,\nand since there is no UK release date\non the horizon as of yet, I would urge\nreaders to order an imported DVD\nfrom Asia in order to watch the film in\nits original glory.\nWith that addendum out of the way,\nonto the film itself. The Grandmaster\ntells the story of Ip Man, played by KarWai regular Tony Leung, a legendary\nmaster of Wing Chun, a form of\nmartial arts originating from Southern\nChina. Ip Man is perhaps most\nfamous for training Bruce Lee, but\nthis point is only touched upon at the\nend of a film which explores his early\nlife, while adding a few historically\ninaccurate embellishments. In a series\nof snapshots, we see him become\nan expert at Wing Chun, and solve\nthe conflict between Northern and\nSouthern schools, before the Second\nWorld War robs him of his family, and\nhe is exiled in Hong Kong. Running\nparallel to this, we have the story of\nGong Er (Zhang Ziyi), the beautiful\ndaughter of a Northern grandmaster,\nand a fierce fighter herself. She must\navenge her father, and continue her\nlegacy, but is ultimately also forced to\nstay in Hong Kong. Their two paths\ncross at various times throughout the\nfilm, and a sort-of love story emerges,\nalthough this is cut down in the edit in\nfavour of a more action packed film.\nThere really needs to be a word to\ndescribe Wong Kar-Wai films - KarWai-an? Kar-Wai-esque? - since his\nfilms share an arresting visual style.\nThe entire film is beautifully shot,\nusing every weapon in Kar-Wai\u2019s\narsenal: the choppy scenes familiar\nfrom Chungking Express, the garish\ncolourscapes of Happy Together, even\nthe warm film grain used in his 2000\nmasterpiece In the Mood for Love gets a\nlook in. The fight scenes are especially\nwell done, climaxing with a scene at\nthe train station which is among the\nmost beautiful pieces of cinema I have\never seen. Sound, sight, and colour\nall come together to create a perfect\nbalance that is completely novel, but\nalso recognisably Wong Kar-Wai.\nWhile the stylish martial arts theme\nimmediately invites comparisons to\nAng Lee\u2019s Crouching Tiger, Hidden\nDragon, this film does not have the\nsame lightness of touch. It is a heavy\nfilm, with ponderous questions about\nthe nature of love and life, but that\ndoes not make it a bad one. In fact, it\nis refreshing to see such gravitas being\nbrought to a genre that has had to\nendure countless terribly trashy films.\nTony Leung gives a characteristically\nrestrained performance as Ip Man,\none full of nuance and subtlety, while\nZhang Ziyi is positively effervescent\n- a luminous presence on the screen,\nwho manages to light up any scene\nshe is in. Unfortunately, despite the\nincredible performances, direction,\nand cinematography from Philippe\nLe Sourd, The Grandmaster seems\nto be missing something. Kar-Wai is\nfamed for his unique, somewhat novel\napproach to filming, in which he will\nreshoot some scenes again and again,\nImperial Cinema\nElysium stars Matt Damon and is\ncreated by Neill Blomkamp, the\nbrains behind 2009\u2019s thought-provoking District 9 that despite\nsci-fi leanings had its roots firmly\ngrounded in reality. What is Elysium about? Blomkamp sticks to what\nhe knows best, crafting another\ndystopian work exploring polemical\nissues such as wealth distribution,\nhealth care and immigration by\nfocusing on downbeat ex car thief\nMax (Matt Damon) who lives in a\nworld ravaged by overpopulation\nwhilst the 1% reside on a separate\nluxurious space station. An accident\nat the factory where Max works\nexposes him to a lethal dose of radiation that gives him only days to\nlive. Max\u2019s only chance of survival\nis the precarious mission to reach\nElysium.\nThe Wolverine sees the return of\neveryone\u2019s favourite chin curtain-donning, wifebeater-wearing XMen(Man?). Wolverine aka Logan\naka Hugh Jackman is tormented by\ngrief/guilt after the events of X-Men:\nThe Last Stand. He doesn\u2019t have\nlong to mope around before he travels to Asia and ends up being chased\nall over Japan by ninjas. There\u2019s also\na bit of a love story too and a nice\nlittle \u2018to be continued\u2026\u2019 tie-in to the\nother X-Men series starring J Law et\nal.\nElysium: Tuesday 05/11 18:30,\nThursday 07/11 21:00\nThe Wolverine: Tuesday 05/11\n20:45, Thursday 07/11 18:30\nBuy membership online. It\u2019s only a\n\u00a35 a year and guarantees you cheaper films and one free film!\nNext week: Mud (Post-Grad\nscreening) and Kick-Ass 2\nbefore scrapping them and coming up\nwith new ones on the spot. Up until\nnow, his films have managed to have\nthis sense of energy, while editing has\nmaintained the pacing, but in this film\nthat is completely off. Some plot lines\nwhiz by like speeding trains, while\nothers linger without being truly\nresolved; characters are introduced as\nif they have great importance, before\nnever being seen again. The result\nis a film that feels both too fast, and\nsluggish; it is a strange experience.\nIn the past the BFI has been\ncriticised for showing safe, Englishlanguage films with broad popular\nappeal; when Clare Stewart asked the\naudience what they thought the film\nwas going to be, she was met with a\nbarrage of names that included The\nButler, August: Osage County, and Her,\nwhich could all - for better or worse -be described as \u2018Oscar bait\u2019. The fact\nthat we got to see The Grandmaster\nwas certainly a surprise, but perhaps\nnot a welcome one and during the\nscreening around 20 people walked\nout. Still, The Grandmaster is by no\nmeans a bad film, and the recut has\nbeen widely criticised across the\nboard for being unrepresentative\nof the real film. With that in mind, I\nanxiously await my Amazon parcel\ncontaining the Chinese version of the\nfilm; hopefully it will be a real surprise\n- and a good one this time.\n\n"

This mystery is up\nthere with the other big\nquestions that dominate\nscience, and has been pursued by\nall manner of scientists over the\nyears. The \ufb02ummoxing phylogeny\nof organisms throughout history is\none of the many factors as to why we\njust can\u2019t seem to pinpoint a magic\nnumber, alongside the natural ebbing\nand \ufb02owing of numbers of species all\nthe time; after all, it is the ultimate goal\nof genes to propagate their organismal\nstronghold into something bigger,\nbetter, faster or stronger, so species\ncome and go as fast as evolution\nallows.\nThrow in the issues caused by\nHow many species are there in the world?\nPhilippa Skett discusses the difficulties associated with determining biodiversity\ndeforestation, global warming and\nother human activity, alongside the\necosystems we are yet to explore,\nand it is easy to understand just how\ndi\ufb03cult it is to track species exiting\nand entering the biodiversity stage.\nThat\u2019s not to say science isn\u2019t\nattempting to get up to speed with\nthe number of species out there. This\nweek saw the WWF announce that\nthey have discovered at least 441 new\nspecies of plants and animals in a\nremote part of the Amazon rainforest\nnewly explored between 2010 and\n2013. These included 258 species\nof plants, 84 \ufb01sh, 22 reptiles and a\nmonkey that purrs like a cat.\nIt\u2019s not just the ecology adventurers\nthat are having all the fun in the\nspecies scavenger hunt either - after\nstudying the genetics of the humpback\ndolphins earlier this week, it appeared\nthat a family that was previously\nthought to only consist of three species\nis actually comprised of four. Based\non both genetically analysing and\nmorphologically studying the Sousa\ngenus of dolphins, it was found that\nanother genetically distinct species\nwas hidden away among the three\nalready recognised based on previous\ntaxonomic classi\ufb01cations.\nEstimating total species numbers\nis an endeavour that has stretched\nthrough the history of the life\nsciences, which has seen various\nsuccesses and much more humorous\nfailures. One of the most noted\nexamples is that of Terry Erwin, an\nexcitable entomologist who in 1982\nbased his estimation on the tiniest\ndataset imaginable. After sampling 19\nindividuals of arthropods from one\nspecies of rainforest tree, he went on\nto make wild assumptions concerning\nhow many species are speci\ufb01c to tree\nspecies, how many trees there are, and\nthen adding some more in for good\nmeasure. He \ufb01nally came to the hugely\nover-exaggerated \ufb01gure of there being\npossibly 30 million arthropod species,\nmuch to the exasperation of the rest of\nthe scienti\ufb01c community at the time.\nAlthough it has been more recently\nestimated that 86 percent of species\nprobably haven\u2019t been discovered yet,\nit has also been deduced that there\nis a less than 0.00001 percent chance\nthat Erwin was right in his arthropod\nestimation.\nPeople are not put o\ufb00 by his e\ufb00orts\nD\niscovering exoplanets\nnearly 20 years ago\nallowed physicists to\nchange their view of\nthe universe. We had\nalways known that our Sun was not\nthe only star in the wide universe,\nbut then came con\ufb01rmation that\nthere are star systems like ours too,\nwith planets of all sizes orbiting one,\ntwo or three stars at a time. Now one\ndwarf star in particular, KIC 11442793\n(catchy name!), may hold a record for\nthe most number of exoplanets, with\ntwo separate research groups \ufb01nding\na seventh orbiting the star.\nChris Lintott from the University\nof Oxford led one research group,\nwho used data gathered from NASA\u2019s\nspace telescope, Kepler, to discover\nthis latest exoplanet. The team have\nsubmitted their research paper to be\npeer reviewed in the Astronomical\nJournal. Lintott has high hopes,\nsaying, \u201cWith a transiting system,\nonce you get multiple planets, the\nodds of them being false positives are\nvery small.\u201d\nThe star itself is just a stone\u2019s throw\naway from Earth at 2500 light years,\nand has been noted to bear similarities\nto our own. One di\ufb00erence though is\nthe fact that all of the planets orbit\nmuch closer to their star - this new\nplanet has an orbit of only 125 days,\nbut is almost 3 times as large as the\nEarth, by diameter. \u201cIt actually looks\nlike our Solar System in one sense,\nwith small planets on the inside and\nbig planets on the outside \u2026 That\u2019s\nnot necessarily what we always see,\u201d\n7th rock from another sun\nsaid co-author Robert Simpson, also\nfrom Oxford University.\nAn interesting point to note is\nthat because all of the planets orbit\nrelatively closely to the star, previous\ndetection methods should have been\nable to predict the seventh exoplanet.\nAs Dr Lintott put it, \u201cEverything we\nknow about this system tells us it\nshould have been found using the\nautomatic detection routines. But it\nwasn\u2019t.\u201d\nSeven star systems can be quite\ncomplicated to deal with and the\ncalculations that need to be performed\ncan become lengthy. Looking for the\nright transit of the planets \u201cseems\nlike a task that\u2019s perfectly designed\nfor computers. But we keep \ufb01nding,\nin these niche cases, in these odd\ncases, in these complicated cases that\nhumans can beat the computers.\u201d\nArXiv: 1310.5912\nPavitar Singh Devgon\nScience Writer\nNASA /JACK PFALLER\nA new species of snake, Chironius challenger\nhowever - a researcher in the number\nof \ufb01elds relating to species discovery\nis thought to discover and describe\naround 24.8 species on average in\ntheir career. We must eventually\ncover all the species at some point,\nright? Unfortunately, with an average\nexpenditure per year of US$97, 000\nper researcher, answering the big\nquestion through leg work alone\ncould potentially cost around US$ 263\nbillion.\nCurrently catalogued, there are\naround 300,000 plant species,\n1,233,500 terrestrial animal species,\nand a somewhat lacklustre \ufb01gure\nof 98,000 fungal species. However,\nestimated \ufb01gures for the total that are\nexpected to exist globally, based on\ncurrent phylogenetic understanding\nand extrapolation, suggest there may\nbe in reality up to 1.5 million fungal\nspecies and potentially 11.4 million\narthropod species. It\u2019s still not quite\nthe same \ufb01gure as Erwin suggested\nbut does show just how little we still\nknow about the true biodiversity out\nthere.\nSo what is the plan? Scouring the\nAmazon rainforest is fun, but if we\nstill have a staggering four \ufb01fths of\nspecies yet to \ufb01nd, amassing only\naround 400 of these over the space of 3\nyears is hardly time e\ufb03cient. Not only\nthat, but the neglected players in this\nworldwide game of biodiversity hide\nand seek are those that really never\nattracted attention in the \ufb01rst place,\nlike the miniscule mushrooms or the\nplacid platyhelminthes. People prefer\nto chase large cats over savannahs\nor catch beautiful butter\ufb02ies in\nforests than pick through mud for an\nunassuming hidden fern or fungus.\nBut taxonomic e\ufb00ort and e\ufb03ciency\nis increasing, and with DNA\ntechnology allowing us to unravel the\nsecrets behind cryptic species - those\nthat appear or behave as one species\nbut may actually be several - we might\nbe able to pick up the undiscovered\nbiodiversity backlog quicker than ever.\nWe also need to simply cover\nmore ground - with some species\npotentially only inhabiting tiny areas\ndue to geological or geographical\nconstraints, simply locating these\nout-of-reach areas is the \ufb01rst step to\ntracking down more elusive animals.\nThe aim now is to get the poster\nanimals of biodiversity out of the\nspotlight and start getting excited\nover the more secretive species; we\nneed more mycologists to track down\nthe mushrooms missing in our lives.\nWe can\u2019t just leave it to the ecologists\neither; it has to be a team e\ufb00ort too.\nWe need the geographers to pinpoint\nareas of interest, the geologists to\npredict just what might be there and\nwhy, and even the mathematicians to\nmodel species and scenarios which\nwe can\u2019t study \ufb01rst hand, such as\nthe progression of species numbers\nthroughout immensely long periods\nof time. Throw in geneticists, marine\nbiologists and the taxonomists too to\npoint us in the right direction, and\nsuddenly it becomes so much more of\na team e\ufb00ort. Biologists need all the\nhelp they can get in the quest to catch\n\u2018em all.\nThe Kepler Space Telescope before launch in 2009\n\n"

    "content": "26 FRIDAY 01 NOV\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n2014 at the Oscars: Be\nLupita Nyong\u2019o (12 Years a Slave)\nOne of the many aspects the critics\nare raving about in 12 Years a Slave is\nthe flawless performances of its outstanding cast. The name that sticks\nout in this category is Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s\npowerful, unforgettable debut per-formance. Her role is heartbreaking,\none that is played with maximum intensity by the Kenyan actress who has\nbeen the talk of awards circuits. This\ncategory is certainly favourable to up-and-coming actresses with first-time\nnominees having no trouble winning\nthe award in the end. You go Lupita\nNyong\u2019o.\nOprah Winfrey (The Butler)\nSo talk-show host Oprah made a welcome return to the big screens this\nyear (her first on-screen role in which\nshe does not play herself in around\n15 years), as part of Lee Daniel\u2019s star-studded cast in which she plays the\nwife of a White House butler. She goes\nthrough plenty throughout the film,\nloneliness, extra-marital affair, alco-holism, family feud, loss of a son, and\nin every single one of her scene she is\nquietly affirming and effective. \u201cEverything you are, and everything you\nhave, is because butler\u201d she says, in\nthe film\u2019s big highlight moment.\nJulia Roberts (August: Osage County)\nAlready awarded for her efforts by the\nHollywood Film Awards, Julia Roberts seems to be in an award-winning\nmood after quite a lengthy period of\nstarring in films that perhaps weren\u2019t\nquite deserving of her star quality. The\nfamily drama she stars in is based on\nthe Pulitzer Prize winning play that\nbrings the Weston family together\nafter a tragedy. Armed with crackling\ndialogue, heated drama and outlandish dark comedy, the cast gives it their\nall, and Roberts\u2019 energetic perfor-mance, in which she literally strangles\nMeryl Streep, is gaining attention.\nJune Squibb (Nebraska)\nThe best scene-stealer of this year is\nhands down won by June Squibb an\nactress who has been steadily working away on the big screens since the\n1990s and is only now winning some\nlove for her brilliant comedic performance in Alexander Payne\u2019s heartwarming road-trip drama. She has no\ntrouble speaking her mind and with\nher blunt honesty comes a guaranteed\nbellyful of laughs, whilst she\u2019s also an\nendlessly supportive, loving and caring wife and mother at the same time.\nShe\u2019s simply a joy to watch, deserves a\nspot in the final five.\nDecember is just around the corner,\nand film studios are lining up their\ncritically-lauded films to take part\nin this year\u2019s much-anticipated Oscar race. As with any year, there are\nstrong contenders in every field and\nit\u2019s certainly too early to be betting on\na winner.\nSo over the next few weeks, Felix\nFilm will be giving you a breakdown of\nthe actors, actresses and films that will\nbe grabbing the headlines in the near\nfuture; but this is in no way a definitive\nlist, as some of the films haven\u2019t even\nbeen released over here yet.\nAnd kicking off our feature is the\nBest Supporting Actress category.\nReady...\nSteady...\nGo!\n\n"
