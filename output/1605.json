That\u2019s the\ndefensive side if you like.\nOn the positive side, there is a\nlimited amount that you can do as\nan opposition MP without support,\nbut I do have support from the local\nLabour council. The Tories are now\nsaying they\u2019ll devolve powers and\nbudgets a lot more to cities like\nManchester and devolve the health\nbudget.\nJR: What do you think of\nOsborne\u2019s city devolution plan for\nEngland?\nAS: I\u2019m suspicious of their motives\nbut I think the principle of it is\nperfectly sound. If the Tories are\nonly going to do it to fragment the\nNHS and slip in privatisation, which\nthey want to do, then I oppose it.\nIf however they were genuinely\ndevolving power and budgets to a\nlocal and regional level then that\u2019s\na thing we would support, so long as\nyou don\u2019t get that postcode lottery\neffect. If they are going to end up\ngiving more money to the east shires\nand less to inner city areas then that\nis something we have got to watch.\nBut the principle of it is perfectly\nsound, and if they are prepared to\ndo that with London, it gives us\nan opportunity to argue for more\nsympathetic environment for what\nthe health needs are.\nJR: Do you think Labour were too\nleftwing or not leftwing enough to\nwin this general election?\nAS: I think that\u2019s not just a stupid\nquestion, but it\u2019s a really pointless\nquestion. I think Labour put forward\na series of sensible policies but there\nwas a lot of misrepresentation. I\u2019ve\nnever seen a campaign in which\neither the party leader Ed Miliband\nwas vilified so much by the majority\nof the press who were very keen to\nsecure another Tory victory, or a\ncampaign where there was so much\nmisrepresentation of policies. So\nif you look at the sort of policies\nthat were supposedly left-wing like\nimplementing a price freeze or\ngetting rid of zero-hours contracts\nand raising the minimum wage.\nThey are pretty mainstream social\ndemocratic policies.\nJR: Before the decision about\nthe timeframe of the Labour\nleadership race was made, did you\nfavour a quick leadership race or a\nslower, more introspective one?\nAS: I think there were three options\nand I was very much against the\nlonger option that would have\nstretched it out into the autumn. But\nI don\u2019t think there is much material\ndifference. The only disadvantage of\ngoing slightly longer is that you don\u2019t\nhave the sort of new team. You have a\nsort of transitional team in place and\nI think people were concerned about\nthat. In reality it\u2019s a decision between\nmaking the decision at the end of July\nor the middle of September, which is\nwould be two weeks into parliament\nsitting time. But I don\u2019t think it\nmakes much difference to be honest.\nJR: As Shadow Minister for Justice,\nwhat are your thoughts on Michael\nGove\u2019s plans to replace the Human\nRights Act?\nAS: Well that\u2019s just abhorrent really.\nI think the only positive thing is that\nit\u2019s already running into difficulties.\nThe Scottish government has said\nthat they won\u2019t do it. There are equal\nissues with Northern Ireland, in\nterms that they will have to find an\nagreement. But they are issues to do\nwith the European convention itself.\nThis is something that the Tories\nhave said as a crowd pleaser to certain\nconstituencies but particularly their\nown back benchers, that I think\nthey\u2019ll have great difficulty doing.\nEither it will be a cosmetic thing,\ni.e. they\u2019ll call it something like the\nBritish Bill of Rights but effectively\nthey\u2019ll have to keep it the same, much\nas they are. Or, they will be trying to\nmake a fundamental change, in which\ncase, effectively they\u2019ll have to leave\nthe convention and I don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s really sustainable so I think\nthere a huge difficulties.\nJR: Do you think, if the EU\nreferendum goes ahead, that the\nUK electorate will vote to leave?\nAS: No, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\nCameron wants either. He will try and\nmanipulate it. I\u2019ve always thought\nthis was just about managing the\nConservative party.\nHe might find it slightly easier now\nthat he\u2019s got a majority but I think\nthere are enough headbangers who\nwill cause him problems, but I\u2019ve\nnever had much doubt that Cameron\nhimself and the leadership of the\nparty do want to stay in, and then\nyou\u2019ve got the leadership of most of\nthe main parties. It will probably be a\nre-run of what happened in 74 where\nit will be a closely fought campaign\nbut I think that the majority of the\nopinion will then be for staying in.\nJR: Do you believe that Nick Clegg\nput country before party during\nthe coalition talks in 2010? Was he\nright to go into coalition with the\nTories?\nAS: I think the Liberal Democrats\nbehaved totally dishonestly and\nthey\u2019ve got exactly what they\ndeserved. I was in the 2005-2010\nparliament when they positioned\nthemselves to the left of Labour, their\neconomic policy gains in that election\nwas broadly the same as Labour\u2019s,\nand then within 24 hours they\neffectively said \u201cNo, no we support\nthe full on austerity that Osbourne is\nadvocating.\u201d\nI think there\u2019s never been a political\nU-turn of that order and that\u2019s before\nwe get to issues like tuition fees. So\nno, I think they put self-interest and\nClegg and the other right-wingers in\nthe Liberal Democrats managed to\ncarry the day and they\u2019ve got what\nthey deserved.People are very cynical\nof politicians I think, partly because\nof this sort of behaviour. In reality,\nthere has to be certain standards and\nI think Clegg fell well below those\nstandards.\nJR: Do you believe in free\neducation?\nAS: In an ideal world yes, but I don\u2019t\nthink that it\u2019s sustainable anymore.\nJR: So what is the magic number?\nAS: Well the magic number for us\nwas \u00a36000 a year. It really is the\ndifference between when 5-10% of\npeople went to University and when\nit\u2019s approaching 50%, and then asking\nthe 50% of the population who don\u2019t\ngo to heavily subsidise those do go.\nSo there has to be some payment\nI\u2019m afraid. I wish it wasn\u2019t the case\nbecause I do value free education,\nit\u2019s just that you\u2019ve got so many\npeople going to University, which is a\ngood thing, but there has to be some\npayment back.\nGraduates do earn more money\noverall, but I do think it could have\nbeen fairer and the debt is too high\noverall. There was a lot of pressure on\nus not reducing tuition fees, but we\nare always going to be talking about\nIt also\nlooks far\nmore likely\nthat we\u2019ll\nget a third\nrunway at\nHeathrow\nWe are\nquite\nlikely to\nsee an\nattack\non civil\nliberties\n\n"

A lot\nhas happened as a result of this\nunprecedented result, including\nthousands taking to the streets\nto show their disdain for the new\ngovernment.\nCloser to home, we elected\nConservative MPs in all the local\nconstituencies except Hammersmith,\nwhich saw Andy Slaughter retain\nhis Labour seat for another five\nyears. We\u2019ve interviewed him this\nweek, to see what his plans are for\nthe local area, how he feels about the\nConservatives ruling the roost, and\nhis thoughts on free education.\nIn our esteemed Comment section,\nwe pick apart the attitude to those\nwho voted Conservative, who seem\nto have retreated from social media\nat a speed proportional to their seat\ngains last Friday morning. It is being\nsaid that \u201cit was the shy tories wot\nwon it\u201d, but perhaps they are acting\nmore cautious than coy regarding\ntheir voting choices. Vitriol is being\nflung left, right and centre on social\nmedia, showing that despite the party\ngaining a political majority, they may\nnot have obtained the approval of\nmany of those with a twitter account.\nIn better news, this week has\nbeen great for celebrating the best\nof Imperial; we have covered the\nStudent Academic Choice Awards,\nwhich showcased our incredible\nteaching, support, supervision, and\ntutoring. We have also covered\nImperial Festival, which proved to\nbe a delightful day of sharing our\nexperience of science with the wider\npublic.\nHowever, the big discussion in the\noffice this week was the removal of\nFelix issues in publicly accessible\nspaces, something that has left\nthe editorial team Felix divided.\nOur last front page was considered\n\u201cinappropriate\u201d for the large amounts\nof children visiting the festival, and\nCollege removed it from campus for\nthe duration of the weekend. With\nvisiting alumni noticing the absence\nof the paper from around campus, it\nwas disappointing that we couldn\u2019t\nhave had such a positive issue to give\nout and show off ourselves the great\nthings Imperial are up to.\nWith news being time sensitive, the\nstory being within the public interest\n(in our opinion) and the nature of\nfront page being the place to print\nour most prominent story, it seemed\nsimply an unfortunate coincidence.\nCheck out our news editor\u2019s comment\npiece on the matter and hear her\npoint of view, and see if you have\nanother view on what happened.\nRegardless of last weekend, we will\nalways strive to fill these pages as if\nthe cat will be always free, although\nwill do so with the lessons learnt in\nthe back of our minds.\nUnlike other student newspapers,\nwe are not subject to editorial control\nby the Union or College. We do not\nneed to send proofs to either before\ngoing to print (evident by the amount\nof typos that sneak through), and\ndespite last weekend we have never\nbeen censored completely and hope\nwe have always managed to get the\nnews that matters to you, straight to\nyou as soon as possible.\nWith that in mind, there is still\ntime for you to get involved. There\nmay only be five issues to go, but that\nis plenty of time to put pen to paper\nand get your message out there too.

    "content": "20 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n15.05.2015\nTelevision Editors Guila Gabrielli & John Park\nTelevision\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDocumentary TV: The Theroux Effect\nLouis Theroux and Camille, in the BBC Two documentary Transgender Kids, broadcast last month, which sparked a debate about transgender issues in\nchildhood Photo: BBC\nJonathan Masters finds himself questioning the aims of TV docs\n\"Is this\nanything\nmore than\nvoyerism,\nor does\nit have a\npositive\neffect?\"\nThose of you that have a TV\nLicence, or have had a look at\nBBC IPlayer recently (much\nmore likely), will have seen that\nLouis Theroux \u2013 the mild mannered,\ninherently awkward, bespectacled\ndocumentarian \u2013 has a new series,\nof which three episodes have already\nbeen broadcast early, due to the\nClarkson-shaped hole in BBC Two\u2019s\nSunday scheduling. My question is, is\nit anything more than voyeurism or\ndoes he have a genuine positive effect?\nTheroux has been making\ndocumentaries since 1998, starting\noff with the often comical Weird\nWeekends series, which varied from\nhim spending time with Black\nextremists in America, to trying to\nembark on an admittedly short lived\ngangsta rap career. The humour of\nthis series was then slightly lost in his\nnext endeavours, which consisted of\nnumerous interviews with various\npersonalities, including the infamous\nepisode where he interviewed Jimmy\nSaville, an incredibly uncomfortable\npiece of television to watch now\nwith the knowledge of Saville\u2019s\nhistory of abuse. The next series was\nto become Theroux\u2019s template for\nmany to come: a much more mature\nand confident portrayal of issues\nsuch as the crystal meth culture of\nFresno, or institutions specifically for\nrehabilitating paedophiles.\nHis current series has focussed\non firstly a two-part piece on a\npsychiatric hospital for criminals that\nhave committed crimes by reason of\ninsanity, an extremely interesting\nwatch that portrays seemingly\nplacid inmates who have committed\nhorrifically violent crimes. There\nis an uncomfortably intriguing\nsequence where it is uncertain if\none inmate is falsifying his mental\ncondition in order to bypass serving a\nlonger jail sentence, highlighting the\nuncertainty of mental health within\nthe judicial system. The third episode\nfocussed on transgender children, the\nyoungest interviewee being a 5 year\nold who, although born Sebastian,\nnow identified themselves as Camille.\nAlso an extremely interesting\nwatch, especially highlighting the\ndilemmas that the parents of these\nchildren face in whether or not to\ndismiss it as a phase, or encourage\nit to the point of seeking hormone\ntherapy for the child. Quite\ninteresting also for the fact that it\nevoked a moral ambiguity in myself,\nmaking me consider if I would allow\nmy (hypothetical) child to make the\nsame decisions at this age that the\nother parents had allowed\nAt its best, documentarian filmmaking can induce this sort of moral\nintrospection, but one has to wonder\nwhere you draw the line between\nportrayal and voyeurism \u2013 whilst\nwatching the first two episodes based\nin the psychiatric hospital, I found\nmyself drawn to not so much the life\nof the inmates in the facility, but to\nwhat crimes they had perpetrated,\nand I think that the documentaries\nthemselves are structured in a\nway that it leads the audience into\nwanting to know what heinous crime\nthey committed, and almost enjoying\nthe knowledge of it.\nLouis Theroux as a documentarian\nis unparalleled in his curiosity,\nfrequently asking extremely personal\nquestions, even questioning his\ninterviewees\u2019 fundamental beliefs,\nsuch as in an episode where he visits\nthe controversial hate-inciting\nWestboro Baptist Church, leading to\nhis trademark long awkward pauses,\nand cringe inducing stares. In an\ninterview with Sophie Heawood\nof The Guardian he stated that his\ngreatest fear was that he \u201cis not\nhelping\u201d the situations that he\nportrays in order to draw attention\nto them and provide greater public\nknowledge; however, this begs the\nquestion: Is greater public awareness\nhelpful, or just a passive act?\nThis is a question that I believe\nmust be asked by not only\ndocumentarians but journalists as a\nwhole. It\u2019s all very well writing about\nthe stagnant state of British politics,\nbut perhaps only writing about it\nis just shifting the responsibility to\nsomeone who is willing to actually\nmake that change.\nIf that is the case, then what is the\npoint? Surely it would be far more\neffective to try and be the change\nthat you want to see in the world\n(I apologize for the shoe-horned\nquote). This issue also came up in the\nQuestion Time appearance of Russell\nBrand and Nigel Farage, where an\naudience member asked Brand why\n\"What does\npromoting\nawareness\ndo if not\nsimply pass\nthe torch\nalong the\nline?\"\nhe has never tried to stand if he\nthinks that the current selection\nof candidates are homogenous.\nNow although I am in no way an\nadvocate for Farage nor Brand, I\ndo think it\u2019s an interesting point:\nwhat does promoting awareness do\nif not pass the torch along the line?\nPerhaps eventually someone will do\nsomething, but what about now?\nThe Guardian interview with\nTheroux then ends with Heawood\nquestioning why he does not\nintervene in places, such as young\nboy in the Westboro Baptist Church\nwho had a vitriolic hatred of\nhomosexuals, taught by his mother.\nTheroux replied with \u201cNo, I go in\nto tell stories, to reveal the truth\nand to try to understand. Not to set\npeople straight,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t go\ninto this with the agenda of saving\nthe world.\u201d It\u2019s possible that this\npassive approach, rather than the\nauthoritarian world-policeman one, is\na more worthy position to take.\n\n"

We\u2019re talking about what the\nLiberal Democrats did and what the\nconsequences were for them and\nthe apology for that which was an\napology for making the promise in\nthe first place, and I just think they\ngot themselves into a terrible mess\nover it.\nJR: The Labour manifesto put\ncutting the deficit as a priority.\nDoes this mean that the economic\nargument has been won and the\nKeynesian model of debt-financed\nsocialism is dying?\nAS: No I think the fact is that most\nresponsible people think we have to\nbalance the books and it\u2019s a question\nof how and over what period and\nwhat criteria we work to in relation\nto that. But what the big difference\nbetween Labour and the Tories on\nthis was the flexibility of how we\npay it off. Are you factoring in the\nrelationship with economic growth,\nso we have the ability to borrow still\nto fund investment? That\u2019s where the\nargument was I think.\nJR: Would you not agree that the\nSNP swept the board in Scotland\nbecause of their anti-austerity\nposition in comparison with\nLabour?\nAS: Yes but if you actually look at\ntheir proposals they were more\nrestrictive than Labour\u2019s so I think\nit made for a good headline but you\ndidn\u2019t have to dig very deep to realise\nthat it just didn\u2019t add up.\nJR: As a former councillor, do you\nbelieve that it\u2019s very important for\npoliticians to have experience in\nlocal government?\nAS: I think it\u2019s helpful but I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s essential. I think people are\nrealising that you want people from\na whole variety of backgrounds to get\ninvolved.\nThere are certain things that are\nthe same; representing people, doing\ncasework, campaigning and so forth,\nbut lots of other experience is useful\nas well.\nJR: What are your key concerns\nover the next parliament?\nAS: I\u2019m concerned that you\u2019ve\ngot a very right wing Tory party,\nwhich is concealed somewhat by the\npresentational skills of Cameron. I\u2019m\nconcerned about everything, from\nrestrictions on trade unions to cutting\nwelfare benefits.\nThis is going to be a very harsh\nagenda that is aimed at the people the\nTories see as its enemies: poor people,\norganised labour etc.\nAnd with the crying social\nproblems that we have, for example\nthe housing shortage, are not going\nto be addressed, and market forces\nare going to dominate without any\nproper mitigation.\nWe are also we are quite likely to\nsee an attack on civil liberties; we\u2019ve\ntalked about the human rights act,\nthe snooper\u2019s charter and so forth.\nIt\u2019s a very right wing agenda and I\u2019m\nnot sure the public quite realise what\nthey\u2019ve voted for.\nJR: In 2010 you voted for Ed in the\nLabour leadership election, who are\nyou backing this time?\nAS: I genuinely, genuinely haven\u2019t\ndecided. We haven\u2019t even seen the\nfull field yet and one or two of the\ncandidates I don\u2019t know that well.\nI do know well candidates like\nYvette Cooper, Andy Burnham.\nIt\u2019s difficult to make a complete\nassessment and I think you really\nwant to give people a fair chance to\nset up their stall so I will reserve my\njudgment on that for now.\n\n"

For this extra special\nentry, Australia is sending Guy Sebastian with \u2018Tonight Again\u2019, a fantastically upbeat declaration\nof how happy Australia are to be allowed to compete that is sure to go down very well. The EBU\nhas announced that should Australia win, they will be invited back next year.

Uzari, the singer/songwriter is no stranger\nto the Eurovision stage after appearing in 2011 as a backing vocalist in Belarus\u2019 unsuccessful entry \u2018I\nLove Belarus.\u2019\nIcan\u2019t believe this isn\u2019t one of the favourites to win. \u2018Black Smoke\u2019 by Ann Sophie will represent\nGermany this year and in my opinion it\u2019s one of the best songs this year. With a powerful,\nsimple, driving drumbeat throughout, an incredibly catchy tune and Ann Sophie\u2019s great voice,\nI think this song deserves to do very well. Germany being one of the Big Five, it automatically\nqualifies for the final.\nMontenegro probably aren\u2019t going to win. In fact, the current odds of them placing first are\n100/1, indicating they may not even qualify for the final. I\u2019m including them because I\nreally, really like their song. \u2018Adio\u2019 by Knez makes extensive use of traditional Balkan\ninstruments, is sung in its nation\u2019s main language (Montenegrin) and is very reminiscent of my\nfavourite Eurovision song of all time, Serbia\u2019s 2012 entry \u2018Nije Ljubav Stvar\u2019 by \u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107.\nTurns out this year\u2019s entry was composed by him so all the more reason to love it!\nAnd Guy didn\u2019t think his life could get any better after he won Pop Idol in 2003.

A diet swap between\nAmerican and African volunteers has\nindicated that one nation\u2019s dietary\nhabits leads to a greater risk of getting\ncolon cancer.\nThe Western diet, which is typically\nhigh in protein and fat but low in\nfibre, is thought to raise colon cancer\nrisk compared with African diets,\nwhich are usually high in fibre and\nlow in fat and protein. Gut bacteria\nare thought to be the key players in\nthis effect.\nThe study, published in Nature\nCommunications, involved 20 AfricanAmerican volunteers and another\ngroup of 20 rural South African\nvolunteers from KwaZulu-Natal\nswapping diets for two weeks. Rural\nAfricans ate a diet of sausages, hash\nbrowns, burgers, and fries. AfricanAmericans, on the other hand,\nswitched to plates of corn fritters,\nmango slices, bean stew, and fish\ntacos.\nThe study involved an international\ncollaboration of researchers,\nincluding some from Imperial\nCollege London and the University\nof Pittsburgh, teaming together.\nVolunteers within the study all had\ncolonoscopy examinations, where\nthey examine the inner lining of\nyour large intestine. The researchers\nalso measured biological markers\nthat indicate colon cancer risk and\nexamined bacterial samples taken\nfrom the colon.\nBefore the experiment, almost\nhalf of the American volunteers had\npolyps \u2013 abnormal growths in the\nbowl lining that may be harmless\nbut could develop into cancerous\ngrowths if left unchecked. Subjects\nwithin the African group had no such\nabnormalities. After the study, the\nresearch team discovered that the\nAfrican volunteers\u2019 cancer risk had\ndramatically increased, whilst the\nAmerican volunteers were found to\nhave far less inflammation in the\ncolon, as well as reduced biomarkers\nof cancer risk.\n\u201cThe findings suggest that people\ncan substantially lower their risk of\ncolon cancer by eating more fibre.\nThis is not new in itself but what is\nreally surprising is how quickly and\ndramatically the risk markers can\nswitch in both groups following diet\nchange.\u201d Professor Jeremy Nicholson,\nthe team leader from the Department\nof Surgery and Cancer at Imperial\nCollege London elucidates.\nColon cancer is the fourth\ncommonest cause of death from\ncancer in the UK, and overall the\nsecond leading cause of cancer death\nin the Western World, attributed\nto over 600,000 deaths per year\nworldwide. However, colon cancer\nrates are regionally heterogeneous,\nwith rates being much higher in the\nWestern world than in Africa or the\nFar East, and greatest in the United\nStates.\nThe major reason for these\ndifferences in colon cancer risk\nseem to be due to differences in\nthe types of bacteria in the gut\nmicrobiome. The rural Africans\nhad more carbohydrate-fermenting\n\"This study\nsupports\nother work\nthat has\nshown\nhigh-fibre diets\nreduce\ncancer risk\"\nmicrobes, and others that produced\nthe chemical butyrate, which has anti-cancer properties. The Americans on\nthe other hand had more microbes\nthat break down bile acids, which can\nincrease cancer risk.\nThis study supports other work\nthat has shown high-fibre diets\nare linked to reduced colon cancer\nrisk. Although their study can\u2019t\ndefinitively say whether the change\nin diet would have led to increased\ncancer rates in the African group and\nlowered rates in the American group,\nthere is good evidence from other\nstudies that indicate the changes\nobserved were signs of cancer risk.\nThe findings highlight a serious\nconcern about the potential\nconsequences of the current\nprogressive Westernisation of\nAfrican communities, which could\nlead to a spike in colon cancer rates\nand become a major health issue. On\na more positive side, this study can\nalso provide vegetarians with some\nmore ammunition when defending\ntheir principles in front of fiendish\ncarnivores.\n\n"

She\u2019s a 9/11 widow; he\u2019s an\nAl-Qaeda terrorist. Scenes of torrid\nsex followed by moments of rising\nhysteria, as the full extent of the\njihadist\u2019s plans are revealed. Will love\nwin? Or will Western righteousness\ntriumph over terrorism? She\u2019s torn\nbetween her irresistible animal\nattraction to him and her strong\nsense of morality which tells her that\nstuff just shouldn\u2019t be bombed. What\na dilemma.\nThis is the script that a B-movie\nHollywood producer (Olivia Poulet)\nis trying to pitch to a famous actress,\nin the hope that she\u2019ll agree to star as\nAmy, the protagonist. The script is\nterrible and she knows it, but she tries\ndesperately to sell it in the hope of\nredeeming her career.\nTo do so, she acts out the whole\nscript to the listening actress,\npeppering it with comments (\u201cyou\u2019re\nwearing a gorgeous Versace suit,\nVersace are on board\u201d). The script\nshe\u2019s trying to pitch is uncomfortably\ncringe-worthy, starting with the awful\ntitle \u2013 Mohammed and Me \u2013 right\nthrough to the predictable scenes, the\nrepetitive script, and the outrageous\nplotline .\nProduct, written by Mark Ravenhill\nin 2005, is a one-woman show, and\nOlivia Poulet is fantastic at carrying\nthe audience through the hour-long\nmonologue, alternating between her\nenactment of the script, full of false\nflattery for the actress, and comments\nabout the lighting and the body-doubles.\nAs the scripts get more ridiculous\nthe actress becomes unconvinced, and\nthe producer becomes increasingly\npanicked at the thought of missing\nthis shot.\nThe pace quickens and, just as\nthe farce of the plot rises, Poulet\nabandons all restraint and becomes\nmore and more dramatic in the\nreading, desperate to get the actress\nto agree. The result is hilarious and\nutterly convincing.\nWhile the satire on the second-rate\nfilm industry is funny, it\u2019s also most\ndefinitely facile. Product-placement,\nhysteria, stereotypes, and easy morals\nare rife in rubbish movies \u2013 but did\nwe really need a 50-minute show to\npoint this out to us?\nThis dig at the callous, shallow\nand poor-taste film industry ends\nup feeling almost overegged, not\nonly due to the script, but also\nbecause of the dated nature of the\ntopic. Although the global terrorism\nparanoia that followed the September\n11th\nAttacks is still very much in full\nswing, the fact that it hasn\u2019t (yet) been\na butt of a disrespectful film makes\na weird choice for satire. Product was\nwritten ten years ago as a fresh, edgy\ncomedy for the Edinburgh Fringe\nfestival. Topical satire of this type\ndoesn\u2019t age well.\nThe play\u2019s funny, and Poulet is\ngreat, but essentially it\u2019s a prolonged,\nscripted stand-up routine, and it\u2019s\nstarting to show signs of age. Product\nis a great vehicle for Olivia Poulet\u2019s\nenormous capacity for humour,\nand she\u2019ll keep you squirming and\nlaughing throughout the play; but\nultimately topical satire just isn\u2019t as\nfunny more than a decade after the\nevents.\nProduct is on at the Arcola Theatre,\nDalston, until the 23rd\nMay. Tickets from\n\u00a312; available online.\n\"Product\nis a great\nvehicle for\nPoulet\u2019s\nenormous\ncapacity\nfor\nhumour\"\nEditorial: An\nUncertain\nFuture\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nFor those of you who have been\nfollowing Felix Arts,you should\nknow that each week we theme\nthe issue.We look at what\narticles we have that week,and\nthen think of how we can link\nthem together,drawing together\ndifferent strands to weave a rich\ntapestry of culture.\nWe will not be doing that today.\nThis week\u2019s issue,if I wish to\nspeak from the heart,would\nprobably be The Uncertainty\nIssue.Or perhaps The All-Change\nIssue.Or maybe simply The\nGrief Issue.That would be most\nappropriate given the new UK\ngovernment,and their plans for\nthe future of British art.\nFor the 63.1% of the population\nwho didn\u2019t vote Conservative,I\nempathise.My Thursday night\nwas spent googling various\npermutations of the question\n\u201chow accurate is an exit poll?\u201d\nbefore I went to bed,waking up\nto a Tory majority that none of us\never thought was possible.\nFor those of you who did vote\nConservative,congratulations.\nYour party of choice made it into\npower,and now\u2013without the\nLiberal Democrats to temper\ntheir more radical policies\u2013are\nfree to pursue whatever aims\nthey wish,unimpeded by an\nopposition.For the moment,it is\ndifficult to tell what the future\nwill bring,although we can make\npredictions: Michael Gove will\ncontinue to repeal the Human\nRights Act; Nicky Morgan\nwill continue to campaign for\nequality by voting against LGBT+\nrights; and the cuts to UK arts\nfunding will continue,most\nlikely at an accelerated pace.\nIt is this last point that I am\nmost worried about.While the\nelection talk centred around\nimmigration,the electorate\nhave failed to realise that a\nmulticultural society is what has\nbirthed such incredible writers\nas Zadie Smith and Bonnie Greer.\nPoliticians are obsessed with the\neconomy,but failed to mention\nthat each pound invested in UK\narts gives a return of \u00a34.The\nphrase\u2018British Values\u2019has been\nthrown around,but people\nhave failed to understand that\nso many of our values revolve\naround our arts industry.\nThe future is uncertain,but it\ncertainly looks bleak.\n\n"

Most of the scenes\nare quiet and intense, hinting at\nrepressed emotions that could surface\nat any time. Lydia clearly adores\nAbbie and there is a suggestion of\nlesbianism to their relationship.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just the students\nwith hidden depths; one of Morley\u2019s\nMaisie Williams and Florence Pugh in The Falling. Photo: Carol Morley/Metrodome\nLast week in Film: Suicide Squad\nIn the face of Marvel\u2019s continued\nsuccess with their Cinematic\nUniverse, DC have begun\nthrowing out early glimpses of their\nupcoming slate, kicking off with a\ntrailer for Batman vs Superman: Dawn\nof Justice*, and now the first image of\nthe Suicide Squad all together.\nDavid Ayer posted the group shot\nto his Twitter account, giving fans\ntheir first glimpse of Margot Robbie\u2019s\nHarley Quinn, alongside Will Smith\nas Deadshot, Jai Courtenay as Captain\nBoomerang, and a heavily made-up\nCara Delevigne as Enchantress.\nThis all follows on from the first\nimage of Ayer\u2019s Joker, as played\nby Jared Leto. That image caused\nsome controversy (as all these things\nare bound to do), with some fans\ndecrying the tattoos sported by\nthis new iteration of the character.\nThe backlash wasn\u2019t that far off\nthat caused by the announcement\nof Heath Ledger in the role for\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight, so\nuntil actual video of Leto in the role\njudgement can probably be witheld.\nThe group shot is an interesting\none, though. It\u2019s mostly composed\nof Ayer\u2019s trademark gritty, grungy\nstyle, with the characters\u2019 appearences\nreflecting that. It\u2019s all dark greys and\ngreens and not much colour.\nHarley Quinn looks like the only\none to have actually sprung from a\ncomic book, so seeing her play off\nthe other Squad members, as well as\nthe Joker (and Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman,\nwho\u2019s making an appearence) could be\nthe real highligh of the film. Robbie is\none to watch, after all.\n*Again: yes, that is the real title.\nThis week\nat Imperial\nCinema\nThis week at Imperial Cinema\nwe\u2019ve got a trio of cinematic\ntreats for you,from a sci-fi classic\nto a new masterpiece of horror.\nFirst up,it\u2019s Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade\nRunner,as part of this year\u2019s\nre-release of the 2007\u2018Final Cut\u2019\nby Scott.\nThis is the definitive version of\nthe classic film,starring Harrison\nFord as Rick Deckard,a retired\nReplicant Hunter.Forced out of\nretirement to hunt four escaped\nReplicants,he encounters the\nmysterious Rachael,and starts to\nquestion his own existence...\nNext,we\u2019ve got Disney\u2019s latest\nfilm,BigHero6,based on the\nMarvel comics of the same name.\nHiro Hamada is a prodigy with\nrobotics,but he spends his days\nparticipating in illegal bot fights.\nRescued by his older brother,\nand introduced to a world of\npossibilities,he gets to meet the\nlovable nurse robot Baymax.\nWhen tragedy strikes,Hiro\nmust track down a whole new\nkind of threat.\nFinally,we\u2019re also showing It\nFollows, a brand new horror film.\nTo say too much about it would\nspoil it,but it might just rival The\nBabadook for\u2018best horror this\ndecade\u2019.\nBladeRunner is playing at\nImperial Cinema on Monday 18th\nMay at 19:00.\nBigHero6 is playing on Tuesday\n19th\nMay at 18:30 and Thursday\n21st\nMay at 20:30.\nThere\u2019s also a 3D screening on\nWednesday 20th\nMay at 19:00.\nItFollows is playing on Tuesday\n19th\nMay at 20:30 and Thursday\n21st\nMay at 18:30.\nTickets are \u00a33 for members and\n\u00a34 for non-members.\nwww.imperialcinema.co.uk\n\"It\u2019s odd and\ndisturbing,\nexploring\nthemes of\nrepression\n[and] sexual\ncuriousity.\"\n\"This is\nnot an\nenvironment\ntolerant\nof mass\nhysteria\"\nmany strengths is that she writes her\nminor characters with the same care\nthat she would give her protagonists.\nGreta Scacchi gives a confident\nperformance as Lydia and Abbie\u2019s\nsnarling form tutor; and the\nwonderful Maxine Peake plays\nLydia\u2019s affectionless mother.\nThe spooky and downbeat film\nscore is composed by Tracey Thorn,\nof Everything But the Girl.\nThe instrumentation is sparse,\nmainly relying on acoustic guitar, a\nlow, clear singing voice, and the kind\nof instruments you might find in a\nschool music lesson.\nThe result is a soundtrack that\ndoesn\u2019t intrude on the drama,\nsignposting what will happen next;\nit is a part of the atmosphere itself,\nheightening the action at times, but\nnot afraid to lapse into silence.\nThe Falling is a great\naccomplishment by Morley.

The\nnominee shortlist was curated by\na judging panel of various student\nrepresentatives, before deciding on an\neventual winner.\nThe award for Best Teaching for\nUndergraduates went to Dr Steven\nCook from the Department of Life\nSciences. He told Felix that he was\n\u201cso grateful to all those students who\nnominated me for this award, and\nto all those colleagues and friends\nwithout whose support I couldn\u2019t\nteach at all. I\u2019m also very grateful that\nI was allowed off the stage before Ben\nthe cameraman could capture my\nPaltrow-esque blubbing for posterity.\nThank you!\u201d\nBest Teaching for Postgraduates\nwas awarded to Dr Mick Jones from\nthe Department of Medicine, who\nis also one of four College Tutors.\n\u201cThe award was a bit of a shock, but\na very nice one. The Mol Med MSc\nis a fairly small course compared to\nsome other Masters programmes in\nCollege and I really do feel honoured\nby the students\u2019 support. I see every\nyear how hard the students work on\nthe course, their enthusiasm, their\ndetermination to succeed, and that\nmakes me do the best I can for them.\nAlso, there\u2019s the fact that I haven\u2019t\nreally stopped being a \u2018student\u2019\nmyself!\u201d\nThe award for Best Innovation\nwent to Dr Elizabeth Hauke from the\nCentre of Co-curricular Studies, who\nteaches both Science Communication\nand Horizons courses. She said that\nshe \u201cwas very moved to receive\nmy nomination, and grateful to\nthe students that took the time to\nnominate me. This award is very\nspecial as it recognises a course\nthat was designed to be delivered\nin partnership with students, thus\nallowing them to make decisions\nabout their learning. It has been\namazing working on this course\nwith the students this year, and I\nhave learned a massive amount from\nthem. Massive thanks to the Union\nfor all their hard work organising\nand coordinating these awards \u2013 and\nfor their extremely professional\npresentation of the awards at the\nceremony.\nClaudia Schulz from the\nDepartment of Computing took\nhome the award for Best Graduate\nTeaching Assistant. \u201cThe only thing\nI could initially say when being\npresented with the award was \u2018wow,\nI really didn\u2019t expect this.\u2019 It was an\nabsolutely overwhelming moment\nand I am most grateful to the\nstudents who nominated me. I love\nteaching and genuinely care about\nmy students; seeing that the thought\nand effort put into my teaching is\nappreciated by students is invaluable.\nAll nominees for Best GTA were\npassionate about their teaching, and\ntheir students highly appreciated\nthis - so really all of them are winners\ntoo!\u201d\nBest Tutoring went to Martin\nHolloway from the Department\nof Bioengineering, who was also\na shortlisted nominee in the first\nSACAs (2013) for Best Support\nStaff. He described it as a particular\nhonor to receive this award, \u201cas it\nis based on student nominations.\nI find it genuinely rewarding to\nhelp students overcome anything\nthat gets in the way of their studies,\nand my door is always open in the\nhope that a student will help me\navoid having to do spreadsheets.\u201d\nAside from tutoring, students in the\ndepartment who nominated him\nwere also full of praise for his \u201cquirky\nsense of humour that he brings to\nlectures, or his significant talent in\nthe department as a drummer and\ngoalkeeper.\u201d\nThe award for Best Feedback was\npresented to Dr Paul Mitcheson from\nEEE, who was unable to attend the\nceremony; Professor Peter Cheung,\nthe Head of Department, collected\nit on his behalf. Students lauded his\nmentality on strict feedback cycles\nand the importance of continual\nfeedback, praising his contributions\nas third year course organizer.\nSpeaking to Felix, Dr Mitcheson said:\n\u201cWe restructured the third year of\nEEE to accommodate industrial\nplacements and to introduce more\npractical engineering via all-coursework lab-based courses to\nfurther enable students to develop a\npassion for applying theory to real\nengineering problems. This method\nof teaching relies on high quality and\ntimely feedback - and it is rewarding\nto see the students highlighting the\nwork of myself and colleagues in\nachieving this goal.\u201d\nAnup Jethwa from the Department\nof Medicine, based at Northwick Park\nHospital, received the Best Support\nStaff award. She describes herself\nas being \u201cthrilled that I have been\nrecognised by the students for this\naward\u201d, and praised the event as being\nwell organised.\nBest Supervision was awarded to\nDr John Pinney from Life Sciences,\nwho told Felix how the long journey\nof a PhD can be tough going at times.\n\u201cWinning Best Supervisor at the\nSACAs meant a great deal to me, as\nPascal Loose, left, hosted the evening.

Photo: Guardian\nSocial media has driven Conservatives to keep their views quiet\nTESSA DAVEY\nCOMMENT EDITOR\n\u201cWell\ndone Great\nBritain,\nAnother\nfive years of\noppression!\u201d\nThe General Election has come\nand gone, and the United\nKingdom has democratically\nelected the Conservative Party into\npower for the next five years. 36.9% of\nthe country voted for them, but if you\nlook at the articles being plastered all\nover the internet and social media,\nyou would have no idea that this was\nthe case.\nThe Felix poll suggested that 35%\nof Imperial students were planning\nto vote Conservative. I\u2019ve spoken to\na lot of people about this election,\nand only one person has admitted to\nme that they voted Tory. But, they\nadded as a caveat, it was because the\nConservative MP in their Fulham\nconsistency was really good. In\nHammersmith, they told me, they\nwould have voted Labour.\nAnd this is at Imperial. It\u2019s no secret\nthat Imperial is one of the more\nconservative universities. Imperial\nwas one of the only universities\nwhose student union did not protest\nagainst the tuition fee rises, going\nso far as to voice support for them.\nThe students themselves largely let\nthe marches pass them by, probably\nout of a combination of apathy and\nright-wingedness. Although my\nonly impression of the Imperial\nConservative Society has been\nwatching from the next stand at\nFresher\u2019s Fair as many people came\nalong and bitched them out, we\ndidn\u2019t even have a Liberal Democrat\ncounterpart until recently.\nI grew up in a part of Wales where\nthe Labour-Conservative battle\nseems very distant. Each of these\nparties takes no more than around\n10% of the vote, with the remaining\nfight being between the Lib Dems\nand Plaid Cymru; voting Labour or\nConservative is not a done thing. I\nremember in the 2010 election, as a\nsecond year Imperial student, I was\nsurprised to find my friends were\nextremely vocal in their support of\nLabour. For me, the young person\u2019s\nparty was the Liberal Democrats, and\nit didn\u2019t occur to me that you would\nvote for anyone else. In this election,\nit\u2019s been a bit different. Obviously the\nLib Dems have fallen out of favour,\nbut I\u2019m again surprised at how much\neveryone seems to have picked up\nLabour as their go-to party.\nI watched the results of the General\nElection with a group of people\nfrom Imperial who all had different\npolitical ideas. One classed himself\nas a Conservative (but he voted Lib\nDem, I\u2019m not really sure how that\nworks), some others still hopefully\ncarried the Lib Dem banner, several\nwere die-hard Labour, and one person\nvoted Green. No one admitted to\nany support of the Conservatives,\nbut given the general reaction to\nsuch confessions on social media, I\nwouldn\u2019t admit it either.\nI\u2019ve seen people be torn to shreds\nfor suggesting that rich people\nprobably pay a bit more tax than poor\npeople, I\u2019ve seen statuses like, OMG\nall Tories unfriend me, Well done\nGreat Britain, Another five years of\noppression! Shops have displayed\nsigns suggesting that Conservative\nvoters should declare themselves\nand pay more tax. There have been\nprotests and riots outside Whitehall.\nBut this isn\u2019t a few hard-right EDL\nor BNP supporters they\u2019re protesting\nagainst here, it\u2019s the largest single\ngroup of supporters in the country.\nSome people I\u2019m friends with on\nFacebook have been organising\ndemonstrations against the current\nmethod of democratic selection.\nUnder the first past the post system,\neveryone knows how it works, and\nvotes accordingly. Under a different\nsystem, who knows if people would\nvote the same way? It\u2019s true that FPTP\nhas its flaws, but all the left-wing\nadvocates of a more proportional\nrepresentation seem to have forgotten\nthat this would give us 82 UKIP MPs\n(if we kept the number of seats the\nsame), and actually the \u201cright-wing\u201d\nTories plus UKIP would still have\nabout the same proportion.\nLabour would lose seats, and we\nwould have a much more fractured\ngovernment. The Greens and Lib\nDems would gain seats, of course, but\nat what cost? We would have a more\nliberal representation in Parliament,\nfor sure, but what is going to be passed\nunder that parliament? Surely true\nproportional representation, and the\ngovernment that would result from\nother voting systems, will only lead to\nthe passing of bills to be slowed and\ndragged out. This might prevent some\nreally stupid things from happening\n\u2013 I think we can all agree that we\nwant to keep the death penalty in\nthe past and stay in the EU \u2013 but this\nmight also prevent good things from\nhappening, like the legalisation of gay\nmarriage.\nMy News Feed is absolutely\nplastered with articles about how\nthe entire country is going to go to\nthe dogs now we have a majority\nConservative government, how all the\npoor people are going to starve/suffer/\ncommit suicide, and how every single\nperson who voted Tory is an awful\nselfish human being who only cares\nabout themself and their aspirational\nideas of moving up the class system.\nSurely this can\u2019t be true, a group that\nis nearly half the country must be\ndiverse, and the policies which drew\nthem must have some appeal.\nI\u2019ve seen articles about the rise of\nthe \u2018shy Tories\u2019, who apparently hate\nthemselves and are ashamed to admit\ntheir greedy, self-centred leanings.\nCharlie Brooker has compared voting\nConservative to masturbating \u2013 you\nprobably do it, but you definitely\ndon\u2019t talk about it. But is it because\npeople are just shy and embarrassed,\nor has the barrage of self-righteous\nhate driven them to keep their views\nto themselves for self-preservation?\nHas being a Conservative voter\nbecome the ultimate taboo in our life\nof first world problems?\nOr is all of this Facebook\u2019s fault?\nIt\u2019s no secret that Facebook curates\nyour News Feed, showing you exactly\nwhat they want you to see, based on\ninteractions you\u2019ve made with other\nposts. Even just hovering over an\nanti-Tory article while you read the\nheadline might be enough to make\nFacebook think that you want to see\nmore, and so you\u2019re eventually hit\nwith more posts than you can read\nabout how the Conservative agenda\nis evil, demonising the poor, disabled\nand mentally ill. Maybe there are\nother posts on social media, you\u2019re\njust not being shown them. Perhaps\nyour social circle isn\u2019t actually quite\nso homogenously angry lefties.\nUnfortunately, this social media\ncensorship only feeds into the\nimpression that the parliament\nis unrepresentative, and drives\ndiscontent and frustration among\nthose who are not in support of the\nelected government, who feel their\nvoices aren\u2019t being heard.\nUltimately, we have the\ngovernment that we voted for under\nthe system that we knew about going\ninto the polling booths. It can\u2019t be\nthe case that everyone is happy with\nthe result, but there is no denying\nthat it represents the electorate in\nthe way it was designed to. While you\nmay disagree with the way people\nhave voted, the angry holier-than-thou attitude is attacking a huge\nproportion of the country, and\nserves no purpose in improving this\ncountry. For this country to drift\nback to the centre, which \u2013 for the\nbetter or worse \u2013 I have no doubt\nthat it will, more people need to be\non board with their policies, and\nthis isn\u2019t going to happen if the\ncurrent supporters of these ideas\nare constantly berating them and\ndenouncing them as reprobate and\nloathsome.\n\u201cOr is all\nof this\nFacebook\u2019s\nfault?\u201d\n\n"

Instead of days\nof coalition talks, or discussing\nthe constitutional ins and outs of\na minority government, we were\nfaced with a Conservative majority.\nWithin the space of hours, the\ncommentators went from discussing\nthe probability of the vote share to\nthe probability of who would end\nup in the cabinet. On Monday we\nfound out that David Cameron had\nappointed John Whittingdale as\nSecretary of State for Culture, Media\nand Sport. Already the tabloids have\nclaimed this as \u201cdeclaring war on the\nBBC\u201d. Whittingdale has a history of\nbeing notoriously anti-licence fee,\nproclaiming it as \u201cworse than the poll\ntax\u201d. Despite no doubt ruffling a few\nfeathers at Broadcasting House, the\nchoice of John Whittingdale, who\nwas Shadow Culture secretary and\nlater Chairman of the Media Select\nCommittee, certainly seems to makes\nmore sense than his predecessor Sajid\nJavid, who by all accounts struggled to\nconvince journalists and the art world\nalike that we was interested in the\nperformances it was his job to attend.\nThe Conservatives have pledged to\ndeliver their manifesto in full now\nthey are unhindered by coalition\npartners, but what does this mean for\nthe arts? Throughout the election\ncampaign, the arts barely got a look\nin, as the discourse was dominated\nby immigration and the economy.\nLikewise, the arts feature in a fraction\nof the Conservative manifesto, in\nwhich the Tories promise to \u201ckeep\nour major national museums and\ngalleries free to enter, support school\nsport, support our creative industries\nand defend a free media\u201d. So far, so\nvague.\nThe details of this pledge pertain\nmostly to investing in a \u201cGreat\nExhibition in the North\u201d, particularly\nthe building of the The Factory, a\nnew theatre in Manchester to which\nChancellor George Osborne has\nalready promised \u00a378m. Whilst this\nis a welcome step towards addressing\nthe long standing bias towards\nfunding London-based projects at the\nexpense of the rest of the country,\nit worryingly suggests that the The\nFactory is being pushed as the face\nof investment into the arts whilst\nsavage cuts are made into the overall\narts budget as part of reducing the\ndeficit. In the last government,\n\u00a3168.5m in real terms was cut from\nthe English arts as a whole since\n2010, representing 36% of the total\narts budget. The funding cuts have\nforced the main arts funding body in\nEngland \u2013 Arts Council England \u2013\nto rely completely on Lottery funds\nfrom April 2015 to fund some of its\ncore portfolio. National Campaign\nfor the Arts (NCA) say in their Arts\nIndex \u2013 the \u2018health check\u2019 on arts\nin England \u2013 that over-reliance on\nLottery fund will \u201cleave the sector\nvulnerable [because] lottery income\nJohn Whittingdale, the new Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, in a valiant attempt to try and appear normal outside Number 10. Photo: Creative Commons\ncan vary hugely depending on the\nmood of the people\u201d.\nIn order to fulfil their pledge\nof cutting a further \u00a312bn from\ndepartmental budgets, the Treasury\nwould have to commit to cuts at the\nsame scale for the next 5 years. In all\nlikelihood, this will lead to the closing\nof local museums and libraries,\ncutting off the grass roots level\ninvestment that is so vital in allowing\nthe arts to sustain themselves in\nthe future. In November last year,\nprotesters took to the street when the\nlocal council in Liverpool announced\nplans to close 11 out of its 19 libraries.\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne published\na draft three-year budget in 2012,\nwhich projected a cut to funding for\narts organisations of 100% effective\nfrom April 2015. Soon, other councils\nmay follow suit with similarly drastic\nproposals.\nThe arts in England are on the\ncusp of \u201cserious and irreversible\ndamage\u201d caused by cuts to funding,\nthe findings of the 2015 Arts Index\nhave revealed. It further reports that\nin order to sustain themselves, arts\ninstitutions have been forced to raise\nprices to raise the earned income\ngenerated. The NCA says that income\nraised in this way is soon to saturate\n\u201cthe amount people are prepared to\npay for a ticket is limited, and so is\nthe number of seats\u201d, and that higher\nticket prices are creating a barrier\nto access to the arts; a recent study\nfound that though engagement in\nthe arts was higher in the 2013/2014\nperiod, those participating were\nfrom higher socioeconomic\nbackgrounds. Reducing access to\nlower socioeconomic groups creates a\nbarrier towards ethnic diversity too,\nand in light of the recent proposals\nto cut funding to arts organisations\nthat fail to increase diversity in\ntheir programmes and audiences,\nthe funding shortage risks driving\na vicious cycle of exclusion and\nfinancial shortfall.\n\n"

Additionally, Isaac reached\nthe milestone of 100 jumps, which\nwas celebrated in fitting style with\nwhat can only be described as aerial\nchaos (involving a Power Rangers\nmorphsuit, a potato and a \u201chotdog-ina-blender\u201d configuration).\nAfter Hassan had popped off for\nbreakfast, our AFF students were\ngoing to get their morning refresher\nbriefing, before doing their first\njump! All of our beginners got 3\njumps in this day! Day two was also\ntrip officer Jos\u00e9\u2019s birthday! He forgot\nall about it though, as he was too busy\njumping (we reminded him later on\nin the bar).\nGoPros abound as Jos\u00e9 and some friends take\nHold\nbeer\nwatc\nAskydiver\u2019s greatest enemy,\nespecially in the UK, is\ninclement weather. So for\nthe first ever international tour of\nIC Skydiving we followed the sun\nto Skydive Algarve in Portugal,\nwhich like our own club has recently\nexpanded to new levels of successful\noperation with the acquirement of a\nnew plane and procurement of a new\nteam of world expert instructors and\ndropzone managers.\nThe dropzone was nice enough to\neven provide us with discount rates\nfor both beginner AFF (Accelerated\nFreeFall) courses (300\u20ac off a 1800\u20ac\ncourse) and individual jumps (28\u20ac\ninstead of 30\u20ac) for our licensed\nmembers.\nOf course, while the main\nintention of the trip was to improve\nour skydiving skills and get\npeople progressing through their\nqualifications, we started the trip with\na day of sightseeing in Lisbon to get\nour bearings and get to know each\nother, apart from novice member\nHassan starting off a trip tradition\nof wandering off and disappearing at\ncrucial moments.\nHowever, once he\u2019d gone on treks\nfor swimming shorts, socks and\nchewing gum, we headed south to\nthe dropzone. It was jump after jump\nfor every member, and most nights\nended with exhausted skydivers\npassing out by the house pool\nafter dinner. Trip officer Jos\u00e9 even\nmanaged to miss his birthday \u2013 too\nbusy jumping!\nAlong with a regular core of club\njumpers, we were accompanied by a\nsmall number of guests of the club\n\u2013 namely, two alumni who could\nprovide assistance and training, for\nno cost, in things like formation\nskydiving and license progression,\nand four members of our allied\nskydiving club at the University of\nLondon, including their current and\nfuture presidents, solidifying our\ngrowing partnership.\nWe were all super sad to say\ngoodbye to the dropzone and all the\nskydivers. We could have been sadder\nthough, as we\u2019d had beautiful weather\nalmost all week and the forecast for\nthe following week was atrocious. So\nthe schadenfreude kept us all a bit\nhappier.\nBy the conclusion of the trip, 5\npeople had earnt their A license,\neveryone had rapidly growing jump\nnumbers by everyone and we had\nparticipated in the first official team\ntraining jump in Imperial history!\nIC Skydiving\u2019s first 4way team jump. Photo: IC Skydiving\nArrival in Lisbon\nWe landed in Lisbon at lunchtime,\nbefore checking-in to a hostel in the\n\u201cnightlife\u201d district. Guided by locals,\nwe had a traditional Portuguese meal\nfollowed by a night on the town,\nwhere everyone properly got to know\neach other and formed a convivial\nspirit that would be carried forwards\nthrough the rest of the trip. After a\nlate breakfast of the world-famous\nPortuguese pastry, Pasteis de Nata,\nwe drove 4 hours south in convoy,\nto move in to our shared villa in the\nAlgarve, only 15 minutes\u2019 drive from\nthe dropzone.\nJos\u00e9 enforced a tour playlist of garage\nand dubstep music in his car, and\nLucy Marriott went from detesting\nthe genres at the beginning of the trip,\nto aggressively demanding them after\na couple of days. Pippa countered by\nplaying rock and metal in her car,\nwhile Isaac\u2019s car had Tchaikovsky and\nDebussy.\nThe group was pressed for time\nto finish breakfast and get to the\nairport to collect the hire cars when\nwe realised that Hassan had wandered\noff to find swimming shorts. He\nended up buying socks. Later, at the\nairport, he disappeared again to find\ngum, starting a tradition that would\ncontinue throughout the trip.\nIn the Algarve, after the boring but\nnecessary registration process, and\nwith the day\u2019sjumping finished before\nwe could get there, a barbeque feast\nwas provided by the group\u2019s more\nculinary members, followed by an\nearly night, ready for a week of nonstop skydiving.\nHitting the dropzone\nThe five student skydivers spent the\nfirst day doing their intensive ground\nschool training, while some of the\nexperienced members got a taste of\nthe incredible things the dropzone\nhad to offer by landing on the beach,\nat sunset!\nMany milestones were reached\non the second day.with Jonny\nsuccessfully completing his\nformation rating, the first team jump\never in Imperial College Skydiving\u2019s\nhistory was completed with great\n\n"

Have you thought about\nwhat you are doing in the future?\nKnowing which career to pursue can\nbe daunting for many students, but\ndid you know that graduating with\na STEM or business degree sets you\nup for a wide range of careers beyond\nscientific research or finance?\nThe Imperial College Law Society\nis proud to present a careers event\non 21st\nMay, open to all students at\nCollege. The event is designed to\nanswer all those burning questions\nyou\u2019ve been thinking about as\nyou consider your future career\nand employment. It has been\nplanned as an interactive panel\ndiscussion, in which three leading\nlegal professionals will talk about\nthe routes they took to get into the\nprofession, discuss what life is like\nas a lawyer or patent attorney at a\nbig pharmaceutical company or law\nfirms, and answer any questions that\nyou might have.\nWe are being joined by Dawn\nGoff, a patent attorney at\nGlaxoSmithKline, Funke Abimbola,\nan in-house lawyer at Roche, and\nSaufung Ma, a lawyer at UK law firm\nTaylor Wessing. These three lawyers\nrepresent three major forms of legal\nexpertise in science and industry.\nSaufung is a senior associate\nin Taylor Wessing\u2019s Intellectual\nProperty department. He works\non both contentious and non-contentious intellectual property\nmatters, including patent litigation\nand trade mark prosecutions.\nSaufung spent six months in Taylor\nWessing\u2019s Cambridge office where\nhe assisted with a number of venture\ncapital, inward investment and\nacquisition projects, particularly\nin relation to technology-rich\nbusinesses. Saufung has a degree\nin Biochemistry from Oxford\nUniversity, a PhD in Molecular\nBiology and Medicine from Imperial\nCollege and was awarded a distinction\nfrom BPP Law School. Saufung is\na member of Taylor Wessing\u2019s pro\nbono committee. He speaks fluent\nCantonese.\nDawn Goff is a patent attorney\nat GlaxoSmithKline, working in\nhighly interesting areas such as\nanti-counterfeiting. All patent\nattorneys need a scientific or\ntechnical background, making\nSTEM students at Imperial College\nvery suitable candidates. A patent\nattorney must have the ability to\nacquire, and enjoy exercising, legal\nskills of drafting, analysis and logical\nthought, and, particularly the skill to\nuse the English language aptly and\naccurately, in written work. Patent\nattorneys act at an exciting interface\nbetween disciplines of law, language\nand science.\nFunke Amimbola is Managing\nCounsel (UK & Ireland) for Roche,\nleading the legal team that supports\nRoche\u2019s pharmaceutical operations in\nthe UK, Ireland, Malta and Gibraltar.\nA recognised legal expert working\nwithin the life sciences sector, Funke\nis also a notable diversity champion\nwithin the UK legal industry and\nhas received multiple awards and\nother recognition for both her\nlegal work and her diversity work.\nShe speaks regularly at legal and\ndiversity conferences both in the UK\nand abroad. As a working mother,\nFunke juggles the demands of her\ncareer with home life and regularly\nsupports working mothers on how\nbest to achieve the elusive work/\nlife balance. She is passionate about\nthe law, diversity, education and\nthe healthcare sector. In addition,\nshe is an expert mentor and regular\nfundraiser for charities including\nCancer Research UK.\nThis event gives Imperial students\na useful opportunity to speak to\nsomeone with a similar background\nto theirs and who was once in the\nsame position as they are now. The\ndiscussion itself is intended to explore\nthe intersections between the legal\nindustry and other industries such as\nfinance or biotechnology. Students\ninterested in a career in business, law\nor science will have the opportunity\nto gain extremely useful information,\nincluding how to develop their\ncommercial awareness. The panel\ninterview has been designed to answer\nwhatever questions the audience may\nhave, whether relating to science,\nindustry or commerce, which means\nthat you do not need to be interested\nin a career in law to be interested in\nthis event!\nIf you\u2019re interested in attending the\nevent,all you needto do is email lawsoc@\nimperial.ac.uk with your name and\ncourse.\nThe talk is to be held in G34 (SAF\nbuilding), and will start at 13:00.\nIt\u2019s not all about rape and murder\nFunke Amimbola leads the legal team that supports Roche\u2019s UK pharmaceutical operations\nAlex Beaghton on the Law Society\u2019s intersectional discussion this May\nLadz on tour in record numbers\nAt Imperial probably one of my favourite things that we\nget to support Clubs,Societies and Projects with is tours.\nIf I mention it to anyone at other Students\u2019Unions they\ncan\u2019t believe that we not only support students going on\ntour but also fund it.Though I guess that in a lot of other\nplaces\u2018tour\u2019is often more synonymous with\u2018drinking\ntour\u2019rather than\u201cwe\u2019re going to go do our club activity\nsomewhere new that lets us experience it in a different,\nexciting way\u201d.\nAll of our funding for tours comes from the ICTrust,\nand as part of this we have to send them a report of\nhow we\u2019ve spent the money.To do this I request tour\nreports from any society that we\u2019ve funded,and compile\nthem all together.Getting to read these tour reports is,\nto be honest,really freaking cool.I love hearing about\nwhat you guys have been up to and the pictures almost\nalways fill me with a huge amount of envy\u2013literally,get\nskydiving to send you some photos if you\u2019ve ever wanted\nto feel like you\u2019ve missed out on an incredible trip.I\u2019ve\ngot a fear of heights but there\u2019s now nothing I\u2019ve ever\nwanted to try so much!\nWe\u2019ve already had an incredible number of tour\napplications from clubs this year,and [rathersurprisingly!\n-ed] still been able to support a huge number of them.\nSkydiving went out to Portugal,Cycling popped over\nto the French Alps,and Cheerleading took the entire\nsociety to a National competition,bringing home one\nfirst and two third places\u2013and that was just over the\nSpring Break!\nWe\u2019re right in the middle of sorting out budgets with\nclubs for the summer tours and it\u2019s looking like there\nis going to be another great batch during the sumemr\nholiday.If you\u2019re a student on the edge of deciding on\nwhether to go on tour with your club this summer I\u2019d\ndefinitely recommend it!\nABI DE BRUIN\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (CLUBS AND SOCIETIES)\nI.

The \u2018Big Society\u2019 pledges come\ndirectly after the arts pledges in the\nmanifesto, suggesting a growing\nreliance on private philanthropy\nand privatisation to sustain the arts\nin the face of falling government\nsubsidy. This has been the party line\nfor some time now. Back in 2010,\nthe then Culture Secretary Jeremy\nHunt said \u201cif you said to me what\nis the one thing I could do [\u2026] that\nwould make a real difference to the\narts, I would say it would be to help\nfoster an American-style culture of\nphilanthropy to the arts and culture\nhere in the UK.\u201d Critics of this policy\npoint out that the tax system in the\nUK does not encourage philanthropy\nin the same way as the US, where a\nculture donating to the arts has been\nbuilt up over decades. Placing all of\nthe funding power in the hands of\nprivate philanthropists instead of\ncentralising to some degree such as to\nArts Council England poses the risk\nof supporting only a narrow range\nof artists, stifling creativity that\ncurrently thrives despite being on the\nperipheries of mainstream culture.\nSilencing this group of new artists\nstill finding their voice would further\nreinforce a chronic lack of diversity\nthat has already taken root in this\ncountry\u2019s artistic landscape.\nMore and more, young artists may\nfind themselves relying on charities\nsuch as Arts Emergency which seeks\nto provide opportunities for young\npeople in the arts via inclusion in\nthe \u2018Alternative Old Boy\u2019s Network\u2019.\nPrivatisation, on the other hand, has\nalready led to chaos at the National\nGallery. When management chose\nto outsource two thirds of its gallery\n\"We\nshould be\nencouraging\npeople to\nenjoy the\narts, not\nstarving it\nof oxygen\"\nstaff to a private security firm earlier\nthis year, the union representing\nthem, PCS, organised two 5-day\nstrikes. A third is planned if a new\npay cannot be negotiated.\nThese strikes have meant closing\noff gallery spaces housing some of the\nmost important art in the country\n\u2013 including Vincent Van Gough\u2019s\nSunflowers \u2013 behind huge black doors;\nschool trips were cancelled, tourists\nwere left disappointed. Citing this\nexample as a possible harbinger\nof worse to come, Jonathan Jones,\nart critic for The Guardian, wrote\nthis week that \u201cfive more years of\nCameron will reduce the arts to a\nnational joke\u201d.\nNot everyone is so pessimistic.\nNewly appointed chief executive\nof Arts Council England Darren\nHenley claimed that Conservatives\nunderstand the value of the arts,\ntelling The Stage that the Tories had\nbeen more supportive of the arts in\nthe previous parliament than they\nwere of many other sectors. Certainly,\nLabour\u2019s plan for the arts didn\u2019t seem\nto differ much from their opponents\u2019:\nwhen a Tory dossier emerged earlier\nthis year claiming that Labour would\nreverse \u00a383m of spending cuts to the\narts, the Labour press team took to\nTwitter to simply say \u201cwe won\u2019t\u201d.\nAlthough under fire from all sides,\nthe country\u2019s cultural capital is\nperhaps one of the strongest exports\nwe have. The creative industries\ngenerate \u00a376.9bn annually \u2013 that\nequates to \u00a38.8m per hour and\naccounts for over 5% of UK jobs. Last\nyear, as productivity fell, the creative\nsector actually grew by 1%. Speaking\nto The Guardian John Kampfner, CEO\nof Creative Industries Federation,\nsays \u201c[success in the arts] has not\ncome by accident or in isolation, but\nis the result of several decades of\nsmart investment and policy-making.\nTo make any further cuts in arts\nand arts education budgets at a time\nwhen we have irrefutable evidence\nof their economic value (let alone\ntheir social value) would be to bite\nthe hand that feeds us.\u201d Jane Webb,\ndirector of studies at Manchester\nMetropolitan University adds \u201cart\nand design is about changing the\nworld, not just producing more\nimages, objects, or working within\njobs that already exist.\u201d The July\n2013 report Humanities Graduates\nand the British Economy: The Hidden\nImpact conducted by the University\nof Oxford has found that 80% of all\nOxford humanities graduates go on to\nbe employed by key economic growth\nsectors such as finance, law, media,\nand education. This is a trend that has\nbeen replicated across universities.\nThe arts are often referred to a \u2018soft\nsubject\u2019, which to politicians can too\noften mean code for \u2018easy target\u2019, but\nthe new government must look to\nthe long term when deciding where\nthe cuts should fall. Being too short\nsighted and caving to the pressure to\ncut the arts budget in order to protect\nothers may do more harm than\ngood all round according to David\nPountney, the chief executive and\nartistic director of Welsh National\nOpera, who wrote last month \u201cwellbeing is not something that can\nbe segmented into physical health\nalone. A lively mind stimulated and\nnurtured by cultural experience is\none very important kind of health\n\u2013 a kind of health that can inspire\nand energise a new generation.\u201d He\nadded that unless the government\ncould recognise this fact, the \u201cnew\ngeneration [could become] the lost\n\"The 'Big\nSociety'\nsuggests\na growing\nreliance\non private\nfunding of\nthe arts\"\nThe Barbican Centre, above, one of London's best cultural centres, will be one of the hardest\nhit, with an ACE cut of 20% Photo: Mindseye Lighting\ngeneration\u201d.\nIn a typically eloquent address\nin the Arts Council England (ACE)\nAnnual Report for 2013-14 published\nlast month, Sir Peter Bazalgette,\nthe Chair of ACE, wrote \u201cwe do hear\nthe question asked, \u201cCan we afford\nto fund the arts?\u201d The answer is\nsimple: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to\u201d.\nAnd the tougher things get the\nmore important our cultural life\nbecomes.\u201d He goes on to cite a 1945\nradio address made by John Maynard\nKeynes, who established public\nfunding of the arts in Britain: \u201c[arts\nfunding is] to replace what the war\nhad taken away\u201d. The case for survival\nof the arts is has never made more\nclearly than by Donbass Opera in\nDonetsk, Ukraine, which remained\nopen to give performances even as\ntanks rolled down the streets. Deputy\nDirector Natalia de Kovalyova said\n\u201ctickets were free and there were\nhundreds of people queuing, we\ncrammed in as many as we could. Two\nold ladies were in tears, on their knees\nand kissing his hands in gratitude\nthat he had opened the season\u201d.\nNothing so dramatic is likely\nto happen here, but there is still\nsomething to be said for escaping\ninto art when life seems hard. We\nshould be encouraging people to come\ntogether and enjoy and participate\nin the arts, not starving it of oxygen.\nUltimately, the new government has\na choice to make; they could view the\narts in a purely economic sense in\nthe short term and cut further into\nthe arts budget, or see the arts as an\nopportunity to invest in the creativity\nand the talent of its citizens and reap\nthe rewards in the long run. I know\nwhich one I would choose.\nThe Almeida Theatre's production of Chimerica, which won rave reviews. Despite this the\nAlmeida is facing ACE cuts of 17%. Photo: Almeida Theatre\n\n"

The exhibition guides\nvisitors through the process of how a\nshoe collection is researched, created,\nmanufactured and presented \u2013\nfrom initial sketches to the detailed\ngraphics on the shoebox.\nI was amongst a group of journalists\ngreeted by the director of the\ndesign museum, Deyan Sudjic. He\nexplained that the museum, along\nwith an exhibition design company,\nhad worked closely with Camper\nbrand representatives to develop the\nexhibition. The introduction was\nfollowed by some words from the\nbrands CEO, Miguel Flux\u00e1. Miguel\u2019s\ngreat grandfather, Antonio Flux\u00e1,\nfounded the first shoe factory in\nSpain in 1877. He was a farmer\nwho went to France and England\nto learn the craft of shoe making,\nafter which he came back to Spain\nwith the equipment he needed to set\nup a shoe-making factory. In 1975,\nMiguel\u2019s father Lorenzo joined the\nfamily business and so the brand\n\u2018Camper\u2019 was born. The brands\nname pays homage to Miguel\u2019s great\ngrandfather, as the word means\n\u2018farmer\u2019 in the language of Mallorca\n(Mallorqu\u00ed) where the company was\nfounded.\nCamper places a strong emphasis\non individuality to create a brand\nthat is different and has its own\nidentity. This sense of individuality\nis reflected in Camper stores across\nthe world, where no one store design\nis the same. Miguel Flux\u00e1 thinks that\nthe world today is becoming a little\nboring and uniform, so he thought it\nwould be interesting for the stores to\nbe different. For instance, Camper\u2019s\nMilan store is famed for having\ndedicated a single blank wall solely\nfor its stores visitors to decorate\nwith graffiti. Recognizing this fun\ngimmick, the design museum has\nreplicated this idea for the exhibition,\nand visitors are welcome to graffiti\nthe blank wall space next to an\nimpressive wall display of white\ncamper trainers.\nThe exhibition guides the viewer\nthrough six of the brand\u2019s key styles,\nfor example Pelotas \u2013 the brands\nbestseller for the past 20 years,\nHimalayan, Twins and Wabi, whilst\nexploring the design, manufacturing\nand history of the family-run\nbusiness whose designs are iconic\nand purchased in their millions\nworldwide.\nThe process of designing and\nPelotas shoes aligned at \u2018Life on Foot\u2019 at the Design Museum.

    "content": "14 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n15.05.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCecily Johnson doesn\u2019t want to set a precedent of censorship\nOn continuing to Keep the Cat Free\nLast weekend, the College played\nhost to 15,000 guests at this\nyear\u2019s Imperial Festival. With\nalumni events running alongside,\nthe festival seeks to raise Imperial\u2019s\nprofile by dragging its scientists and\nengineers out of the laboratory to\nshare their research with the public.\nBut this year, one regular campus\nfixture wasn\u2019t being presented to\nthe ImpFest audience: the student\nnewspaper, Felix.\nUnfortunately, our front cover\nlast week featured the story of Nur\nFitri Azmeer Nordin, a former third\nyear mathematics student who was\nrecently convicted of making and\ndistributing child pornography.\nSubsequently, the Imperial College\nCommunications and Public Affairs\ndivision (Comms) made the decision\nto remove all copies of Felix from\npublic access for the duration of the\nfestival, after we\u2019d already distributed\nthe paper around campus.\nThe Felix team was able to\ncompromise and move some Felix\ndistribution bins inside the Central\nLibrary in the hope that some\nstudents would still be able to access\nthe paper. However, against our\nwishes, Imperial Estates Facilities\nemployees were sent to remove the\npapers before the end of the day,\nmeaning that large numbers of\nstudents leaving lectures, labs and\ntutorials after this time were unable\nto access copies of Felix.\nWhen initially informing Felix of\ntheir decision, Comms indicated that\nthey did not think our front cover\nwas suitable for children; they later\ncited fears that they might receive\ncomplaints from parents attending\nthe festival if the papers remained\naccessible. However, it is my feeling\nthat there was nothing on the cover\nthat children couldn\u2019t potentially see\nany time they walk past a newsagents\nor glance at a television showing the\nevening news.\nSince the limited distribution was\nannounced, the question of whether\nit amounts to censorship has been a\nhot topic in the Felix office. A quick\nGoogle tells us that the definition\nof censorship is \u201cthe suppression\nof speech, public communication\nor other information which may\nbe considered harmful, sensitive...\nor inconvenient, as determined by\ngovernments... authorities or other\ngroups or institutions\u201d. College\u2019s\naction to restrict Felix\u2019s distribution\nchannels certainly falls within this\nremit, in my opinion.\nEven among our own ranks,\nthere was a wide range of reactions\nto Comms\u2019 decision. There was\nuniversal sympathy for the position\nthat College were put in: a campus\ndecorated with the phrase \u201cextreme\nchild pornography\u201d at the same\ntime as it was being flooded with\nyoung visitors (and their parents).\nHowever, there was a lot of anger and\nfrustration at the way they responded.\nMany of us felt that was overkill to\nremove Felix distribution bins from\nareas of campus that were not hosting\nFestival talks, booths and events.\nThe clearly designated festival\nentrance was on Imperial College\nRoad, and the vast majority of\nvisitors would likely not stray\nfurther than the Queen\u2019s Lawn, Sir\nAlexander Fleming Building or the\nSherfield Building. Despite this, our\ndistribution bins were also removed\nfrom the Business School entrance\nand City and Guilds Building, areas\nnot directly involved in the festival\nbut visited mostly by our regular Felix\naudience.\nI am by no means accusing College\nof attempting to silence this story\naltogether. There was no attempt to\nrestrict access to the online version\nof the article, and some students were\nstill able to get hold of physical copies\nof Felix from the bins we put in the\nlibrary and in Beit Quad. However,\nwithdrawing distribution from our\nmost high-traffic areas so early on a\nFriday afternoon directly resulted\nin readers not being able to access\nthe paper that a team of around 50\nstudents put hundreds of collective\nman-hours into producing.\nCollege\u2019s intention may not have\nbeen to restrict Felix\u2019s content\nfrom its normal audience, but they\ninadvertently did, and their action\nalso kept Felix out of the path of\nprospective students and alumni.\nFelix contributors attending ImpFest\nhave relayed stories of alumni\nasking festival volunteers what had\nhappened to Felix and why it was\nmissing from campus. If Comms\nhad voiced concerns about the story\nsooner, we might have been able to\nwork with organisers to make copies\navailable on request.\nI picked up my first issue of Felix\nwhile attending an Imperial open\nday as a prospective student, and it\nwas this that inspired me to seek out\nthe team during Freshers\u2019 Fair last\nOctober and get involved. While Felix\nis a newspaper made by students, I\ndon\u2019t think it is necessarily only for\nstudents. We count many members of\nthe College and Union staff amongst\nour readership, and our online\npresence enables us to reach alumni\nand non-Imperialites too. It saddens\nme to see our distribution restricted\nfrom any audience.\nFelix is in a unique position among\nstudent publications in the UK in\nthat we have independent editorial\ncontrol over all our content. We are\nvery fortunate \u2014 and proud \u2014 not to\nhave to send our paper to anyone at\nthe College or the Union for review\nbefore going to print each week.\nHowever, of our own volition we\nfrequently work with Comms and\nthe Union where appropriate to lend\ninsight and balance to our articles.\nThe phrase \u201cKeep The Cat Free\u201d,\nfirst adopted as Felix\u2019s motto in 1974,\nhas always represented both the cost\nof the paper and its tradition of free\nspeech. There have been attempts\nto infringe on this freedom in the\npast \u2014 some of them successful \u2014 and\nit is vital that we publicly recognise\nand consider the consequences of\nsuch actions. We must not allow a\nprecedent to be set for College to\nsquirrel student media away from\nthe public view whenever they take a\ndisliking to our content.\nIn a world where our own\ngovernment is seeking to introduce\nwide-ranging powers to ban citizens\nfrom broadcasting and require\nthem to submit communications\nfor \u2018approval\u2019 before circulation,\nit is more important than ever for\nus to be aware of matters of free\nspeech. Moving a few distribution\nbins out of public view is not a great\ntransgression, but it is toeing the line\nof censorship and \u2014 to my mind \u2014\nthat is a very dangerous thing indeed.\nOne thing not being handed out at Imperial Festival was copies of Felix. Photo: Imperial College\n\u201cIt is more\nimportant\nthan ever\nfor us to\nbe aware\nof matters\nof free\nspeech.\u201d\n\u201cComms\nindicated\nthat they\ndid not\nthink\nour front\ncover was\nsuitable for\nchildren\u201d\nCECILY JOHNSON\nNEWS EDITOR\n\n"

In welfare,\nmental health is a much discussed\nissue with ever-increasing helpful\nresources, but there is a group of\npeople often left out from the media\nspotlight. These are the friends who\nsupport friends with eating disorders,\nthose in relationships who lighten up\ntheir partner\u2019s depression, or parents\nwho calm their child with anxiety, to\nname a few examples.\nConsiderate friends and family\nmake every effort to understand\nand accommodate their loved ones\nwith mental conditions. Unlike\nprofessional supporters, they often\nhave little to no training themselves,\nwilling to learn by patient trial-and-error, consulting online forums or\ncall centres, just so they can help their\nloved ones however they can.\nIt\u2019s not easy and can be quite\ntaxing for the friends and family.\nOutsiders might think it\u2019s simply\nabout \u201clistening\u201d and \u201cbeing there\u201d\nfor those who need it. But that\u2019s a\nhuge over-simplification; mental\nconditions aren\u2019t like \u201cfeeling down\u201d\nwhere a good heart-to-heart talk\ncan fix everything. It\u2019s a sustained\ncommitment, helping the sufferer\nthrough the ups and downs of the\ncondition, trying to be understanding\neven when they don\u2019t quite\nunderstand what\u2019s asked from them.\nEspecially as friends and family, they\nknow that their loved ones rely on\nthem.\nSo to help the supporters, I\u2019ve\ncompiled a list of tips and things\nto bear in mind in order to make it\neasier.\nIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not me\nSometimes, supporters can be hurt by\nwhat their loved ones say during their\nphase. For depression, the sufferer\nmight go silent for days until you\nthink that you\u2019ve done something\nwrong. During an anxiety attack,\nthey might burst out with insensitive\naccusations because they\u2019re feeling\noverwhelmed by their emotions.\nWhat makes it particularly sting is\nbecause they\u2019re so unlike their usual\ncharacter.\nYou should understand that this is\nthe condition talking, not them. And\ndon\u2019t feel guilty too because it\u2019s not\nyour fault. The sufferer will often\ncome to their loved ones to apologise\nafter the phase, for it is never their\nintention to hurt the people they\nalso love (perhaps even more than\nthemselves in the worst of times).\nDepression, anxiety and bipolar\ndisorder cloud the mind, crippling it\nwith hopeless or a rush of thoughts\nthat couldn\u2019t be turned off. Even\nsubtler conditions such as eating\ndisorders can plant doubts and false\nassumptions in your head, making\nit feel like it\u2019s the most obvious\ntruth. They\u2019ve got their hands full\nto overflowing dealing with the\nthoughts in their head.\nTherefore, distancing yourself\nfrom the disruptive condition might\nbe the best way to prevent yourself\nfrom getting hurt when trying to\nhelp. It can be as simple as attributing\nthe hurtful things said to the illness\nitself, trying not to get your feelings\ninvolved as you comfort them. By\ndoing this, you don\u2019t care less about\nthem. In fact, it makes you a more\neffective supporter, because you\u2019ll\nfocus on the issue at hand.\nKnow that they are suffering\nGoing through the lows of the illness\nis not something they\u2019d choose to\nfeel if they could help it. They are in\nthe grips of their thoughts, driven on\nby the condition, and it is a horrible\nfeeling that they can\u2019t control.\nAs you support your friends\nor family members, it helps to\nremember that it is not a choice\nor overreaction, but something\ninvoluntary. Sometimes, they would\ncommunicate that they need help\nwith it when it is too much for them\nto bear alone, but sometimes it is\npossible that the sufferer prefers to\nstay quiet and cope with it themselves\nso it wouldn\u2019t become worse.\nRegardless, I want to remind you\nthat by sharing their vulnerabilities\nand suffering, they are placing a\nlot of trust on you on a sensitive\ntopic, which shows how much they\nappreciate you.\nIt will pass\nMental illnesses usually come in\nphases. For example, depression\noscillates between normal and relapse\nperiods. For some people, these occur\nevery week for a few days at a time.\nFor others, they last for weeks but\noccur only once every few months.\nAs someone close to the sufferer,\nyou\u2019ll know this better than most or\nbegin to notice patterns that aren\u2019t\nyet confirmed. So even when you feel\nworn down, do remember that it is\nnot always this way.\nDon\u2019t let it define your\nrelationship\nThere\u2019s a misconception about living\nwith people with mental illness\nwhere it\u2019s believed that the supporter\nhas to spend all of his or her time\nsupporting the sufferer. This is far\nfrom the truth, as you\u2019ll probably\nrealise from the \u2018it will pass\u2019 section.\nIt will only be a small part of the\nrelationship, such as how a couple\nA group of kind committed friends can bring even an old grey grumpy donkey to a smile. Image:\nhdwallpapersdesktop\nChanon Wongsatayanont has tips to make helping friends easier\nIf you are concerned about\nyour own mental health,or\nthat of a loved one,there are\npeople out there you can talk\nto who can give you advice,or\nwill be there to listen.\nHelplines\nIf you are distressed and need\nsomeone to talk to :\nSamaritans (24 hr helpline):\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nwww.samaritans.org.uk\nAnxiety Help :\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 09:30-17:30)\nwww.anxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10:00-22:00)\nwww.nopanic.org.uk\nEating Disorders:\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,13:30-16:30)\nAddiction:\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nwww.alcoholics-anonymous.\norg.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nwww.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling Service\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.uk\nImperial College Health\nCentre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@ic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal tutor\nregarding pastoral issues,\nespecially if you think your\nmental health might be\naffecting your academic\nperformance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nwhere one person is suffering from\ndepression can hang out and travel\njust as much as everyone else, and\nis in need of support every once in\na while. Sure, you might not be able\nto do certain things when one is\nsuffering an episode, but the intimate\nunderstanding and trust make the\nrelationship special in its own way.\nPlus, despite the fact that these\nconditions stay with a person\nthroughout their lives, things don\u2019t\nalways have to be the way it currently\nis. Loved ones can significantly help\nin developing mechanisms that helps\nsufferers to cope. As they are familiar\nwith the onset, they can remind the\nsufferer that a phase is coming in so\nthey can stop the onset of an anxiety\nattack before it spirals out of control.\nIt will be a constant fight against this\nillness, but you both can get better at\nbeating it.\nI hope the tips are helpful to the\nkind friends and family supporting\ntheir loved ones through their\npersonal struggle.\nIf you have specific questions, there\nare a lot of guides available online\nthat are geared towards supporters\nMore importantly, the call centres\nlisted on the side can also be helpful\nfor the supporters as well as sufferers.\nRemember that people on the other\nend of the phone are also supporters.\nIt\u2019s their job. So they could truly\nunderstand and sympathise what\nyou\u2019re going through.\n\n"

The Band\nof Household Cavalry were one of\nseveral musical acts to perform at the\nfestival, alongside Geekpop songster\nJohnny Berliner and two of Imperial\u2019s\nstudent a cappella groups, The\nImperielles and The Techtonics.\nSplitting events up into multiple\nthemed zones, the campus was filled\nwith interactive exhibits for young\nand old visitors to enjoy. In the\nmarquee on Queen\u2019s Lawn there was\nthe Research Zone, where many of\nImperial\u2019s departmental research\ngroups set up stalls with games and\nopportunities to see new technologies\nin action.\nThere was the Brain Zone in\nSherfield Building, the Robot Zone in\nSir Alexander Fleming Building, the\nLight Zone in the Great Hall and the\npopular Superbug Zone in the Flowers\nBuilding, where visitors could learn\nabout everything \u201cfrom ancient\nbacteria to toxic fungi\u201d.\nThe College invited a team of\n\u2018Science Buskers\u2019 led by Dr Simon\nFoster to entertain crowds with on-the-spot demonstrations alongside\nballoon performers, bubbleologists\nand a cast of famous historical figures\nfrom science who roamed the festival\ncampus.\nImperial\u2019s fleet of antique car\nmascots were out on show near the\nFestival entrance, with volunteers\nfrom the Motor Clubs explaining\ntheir history; George the Mechanical\nDragon was also parading around\ncampus, amusing visitors.\nThe Food Zone featured stalls\nfrom the London Farmer\u2019s Market\nand a College-run barbeque, and\ndrinks were available at Imperial\u2019s\n\u201cpop-up pub\u201d, the Haemo Globe Inn.\nThe College also sold merchandise\nincluding limited edition Imperial\nFestival T-shirts and bags.\n\n"

A truly\ncollaborative effort, this showed the depth\nand breadth of the wonderful work staff are\ndoing at this world-leading institution. It was\na genuine treat to see so many staff members\ncollaborating to bring science to the masses, as\nwell as removing that bloody rag Felix from the\ncampus. Good riddance.\u201d\nThe weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building\nBlue News\nProvost Post\nof the Week\nEvery week, a member of\nour esteemed Provost board\nshares their thoughts with\nour collaborative, cohesive\ncommunity. This week, we\nwelcome back Al Pologies,\nVice Provost (Arbitrary\nExcuses)!\nUnfortunately, Al was too busy\nmaking plans for our upcoming\nAll-Staff Party to celebrate\nImperial Festival, so he wasn\u2019t\nable to write his column this\nweek either.\nWe\u2019ll get hold of him one day,\nI promise!\nIn place of Al\u2019s column this\nweek, we\u2019ve invited Emma\nPerial, Vice Provost (Marketing)\nto give us a few words about\nImperial Festival!\nHi everyone, Em here!\nI just wanted to say a massive\nthanks to everyone who helped\nout at Imperial Festival, anyone\nwho came along over the\nweekend, and all of you who\nsent us positive thoughts and\nencouragement throughout the\nstressful preparation time.\nI\u2019m so delighted at how\nsuccessful the Festival turned\nout to be \u2013 there were happy,\nsmiling children all over the\ncampus at the weekend, and\nit was wonderful seeing the joy\nand enthusiasm for science on\ntheir little faces.\nThere were adults around\ntoo \u2013 obviously, haha! \u2013 and\nit was just as brilliant seeing\nthose of us with a few more\nyears experience still learning\nsomething new.\nImperial\u2019s cutting-edge\nresearch gives us an enormous\nedge, and it was a privilege to\nbe able to lead the charge of\nshowing all of our work to the\nmasses.\nTo borrow a famous phrase,\nI think our mission statement\ncould be summed up as:\n\u201cGive me your young, your\nold, your huddled masses\nyearning to learn more about\nworld-leading science.\u201d\nAnd with great delight, I\nfeel confident in saying we\nsucceeded. Imperial Festival\nwas an impossibly vast success,\nfrom our brilliant marketing\ncampaign to the Festival itself.\nThank you again, one and all\n\u2013 until next year!\nHello all,\nWelcome, welcome, welcome to this week\u2019s Blue News! After the\nresounding success of Imperial Festival, it\u2019s a week of celebration here in\nthe Faculty Building!\nWe\u2019ve got all sorts of events planned, but I\u2019m most excited for this week\u2019s\nAll-Staff Briefing Party, which is an excellent excuse for everyone to let\ntheir hair down after a hard week\u2019s celebration.\nAs part of the celebrations, I went for a jubilatory meal with Emma Perial,\nthe Vice Provost (Marketing), and we paid a visit to the rather delightful\nNando\u2019s restaurant on Gloucester Road! As a newcomer to the world of\nNando\u2019s, I have to admit I was a little confused by Em\u2019s referring to our\nlunchtime trip as \u201ctaking the Pres for a cheeky Nando\u2019s\u201d.\nWhen I asked her what was so \u201ccheeky\u201d about our outing, she had to\nexplain to me what was going on. A bit of internet research later, and\nI must confess I\u2019m still slightly confused by you \u201ccheeky\u201d Brits! Just an\nentertaining anecdote to liven up your day!\nFinally, I think it\u2019s worth addressing quite possibly the only issue to have\ncome up at Imperial Festival: the noisy complaints from the student\n\u201cnewspaper\u201d (their words, not ours) that we removed their bins.\nFirstly: I don\u2019t quite understand their complaints, as no garbage\nreceptacles were moved anywhere over the weekend. Secondly, I wish to\nreiterate our support for student media in all its forms (and regardless of\nquality). Imperial\u2019s status as a world-leading institution is confirmed by\nour highly active body of students, and their engagements with a wide\nvariety of hobbies outside of their degrees. We firmly believe in ensuring\nthat our students get value for money leave this university feeling like\nfully-rounded human beings with a wide skill-set.\nBesides, would we publish Blue News here if we didn\u2019t think a student\n\u201cnewspaper\u201d (again, their words) was worthwhile? Of course not. We\u2019d\nhave to pay for it, for a start!\nHave a productive, cohesive, collaborative and happy day!\n\n"

Photo: Standard\nGeorge Butcher wonders whether the Tories learnt anything\nGEORGE BUTCHER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nThe Liberal Democrats have\nhad the number of their MPs\nslashed from 57 to just eight.\nMembers of Parliament who have\nbeen in government for 30 years\nare no longer. Part of their downfall\ncan be attributed to their support of\nraising tuition fees, part to supporting\nthe Conservatives, and part of it\nbecause, apparently, Lib Dem voters\ndon\u2019t actually want them to do\nanything.\nThe Liberal Democrats entered\ngovernment at a time of great\nuncertainty. The thirteen year long\nLabour rule was ending, we\u2019d just\nentered the most severe recession\nsince the 1930s, and the Eurozone\nwas about to implode. We needed a\nsecure government and we needed it\nsoon; the Lib Dems took a risk, and it\npaid off.\nVoters don\u2019t seem to have given\nthem credit \u2013 they allowed a\nConservative party into Number\n10, implementing some deeply\nunpopular policies such as the\nbedroom tax and raising tuition fees,\nbut they also stopped the Tories from\nbeing right-wing enough to hold a EU\nreferendum. It\u2019s the classic problem\nthat faces the smaller party in any\ncoalition.\nHowever, I think the electorate is\nmistaken. We will all miss the impact\nof the Liberal Democrats over the\nnext 5 years.\nDavid Cameron is now beginning\nto enact the policies that the Lib\nDems had prevented. The new Bill\nof Human Rights will require you\nto seek appeals in Europe before\nthe British Supreme Court, making\nit harder to reach justice. The\n\u2018snooper\u2019s charter\u2019 gives the police\nwide-reaching powers, including the\npower to prevent someone accused\nof \u201cextremism\u201d from publishing\nanything without their permission,\nincluding a public defence. This is\nlikely to impact peaceful protestors.\nThey are re-drawing the constituency\nboundaries, making it harder for\nLabour to win seats, all in the name of\n\u2018fairness\u2019 whilst ignoring the inherent\nunfairness in the electoral process\nalready.\nThe Liberal Democrats wanted\nto build more homes so that we\ncould afford to buy one. The Tories\nwant to inflate prices so you can\u2019t.\nThe Conservatives are going to risk\ntaking us out of Europe and threaten\nexisting strong links in science and\nindustry.\n\u00cdThe Lib Dems wanted to defend\nthat. George Osborne wants to drive\nfurther cuts \u2013 needless when the\nGovernment can borrow at around\n0.5%, whilst the Liberal Democrats\nwanted to cut slower and use the\neconomy\u2019s growth and accompanying\ntax receipts to move from a deficit.\nThey\u2019ve pulled the government into\nthe centre ground; in fact both the\nFinancial Times and The Economist\nMagazine supported the continuation\nof the coalition.\nSo why the loss of seats? Many\npeople I speak to are upset that\nthe Liberal Democrats \u201cgot into\nbed with the Tories\u201d. Why? These\nare the same people who also call\nfor a more proportional system\nof representation. If you want\na government that represents\nthe majority, you have to accept\ncoalitions. The last party to get half\nthe vote in a general election was the\nConservatives in 1930.\nI don\u2019t have a particular party\nloyalty. I\u2019ve only been able to\nvote in one general election so I\nbarely have a voting record. Like\nmany, I want a government that\nis fiscally responsible but that also\nrecognises the social importance of\nthe government. Thatcher brought\nthe economic reform we now all live\nwith, but we need to use the wealth\nwe create to reduce inequality and\nimprove the public services we all\ndepend upon.\nThe onus is now on David Cameron.\nThe Conservative Party will not\nsurvive another election if they\ncannot meet the demands of the\nelectorate. The Tories may have the\neconomic high ground, they may\nappeal to the \u2018aspirational class\u2019,\nbut if they can\u2019t present a fair social\npolicy for Britain, they will have no\nfuture from the moment Labour or\nthe Liberal Democrats regain their\ncredibility.\nWhen Tony Blair won in 1997, he\ndidn\u2019t settle back into old Labour.\nHe pushed further forwards, whilst\nalienating many in his party, gaining\nthe support and trust of the public. If\nDavid Cameron wants another term,\nhe\u2019ll need to move to the centre too.\nThis is what he promised to do when\nelected Conservative leader in 2005.\nThere are some signs of this\nhappening, he spoke of \u201crebalancing\nour economy,\u201d and \u201cgiving the\npoorest people the chance of training,\na job, and hope for the future\u201d. Now is\nthe best time.\nIf he can genuinely work to reduce\ninequality and improve public\nservices, he\u2019ll leave Labour with\nnowhere left to stand.\nWe will miss the central ground\nthat the Liberal Democrats offered\nus all, whether you voted for them\nor not. We\u2019re now getting five\nyears of unrestrained Conservative\ngovernment and it remains to be seen\nwhether they learnt anything from\ntheir coalition partners in the past\nfive years, or whether they\u2019ll return\nto their home ground and be pushed\naside by the centrists.\n\u201cIf you\nwant a\ngovernment\nthat\nrepresents\nthe majority,\nyou have\nto accept\ncoalitions.\u201d\n\u201cthey\nallowed a\nConservative\nparty into\nNumber 10...\nbut they also\nstopped the\nTories from\nbeing rightwing\u201d\n\n"

And with Serbia, Cyprus and\nthe Czech Republic returning to the contest along with Australia debuting as a guest entrant, this year is gearing up to be the biggest in the competition\u2019s\nhistory, with 40 nations competing and an unprecedented 27 performing in the Grand Final on 23rd\nMay. Here\u2019s my top 10 songs to keep an eye out for,\nincluding some of the most likely to win and a few of my personal favourites.\nWith what can only be described as a techo mash-up of \u2018Cotton Eyed Joe\u2019 and the Birdseye\nPotato Waffles song, this year we are sending Electrovelvet with their song \u2018Still In Love\nWith You\u2019. I\u2019ll admit my first reaction to this song was one of dread and \u2018wow, we\u2019ve\nreally given up this year\u2019. However the song has since grown on me immensely. Most of Europe has\ntaken a detour from zany, quintessentially \u2018Eurovision-y\u2019 songs this year in favour of more serious,\noften melancholy numbers. This means our song could really stand out as a fun and silly entry,\nhopefully sticking in peoples\u2019 minds as they cast their votes.\nWith pop music being one of their biggest exports, Sweden takes Eurovision very seriously.\nThey vote nationally for who will represent them in an X-Factor-like, immensely popular\nseries of live shows named Melodifestivalen. This year it was won by M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w\nand he will sing \u2018Heroes\u2019. It\u2019s a catchy, high-energy song, but I feel like it doesn\u2019t particularly stand\nout. However, it\u2019s actually favourite to win and will undoubtedly place in the top 5.\nIn 2006 Lordi took Europe by storm with \u2018Hard Rock Hallelujah\u2019, which became the first and\nonly hard rock song to ever win the contest. This year they\u2019re hoping for success with punk rock\nband Pertti Kurikan Nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t and their song \u2018Aina Mun Pit\u00e4\u00e4\u2019. All 4 members of the band\nhave learning disabilities and are hoping to raise awareness of people with learning disabilities and,\nas they put it, \u2018have a fucking good time\u2019.\nEstonia\u2019s song, \u2018Goodbye To Yesterday\u2019 by Elina Born and Stig R\u00e4sta, is my personal favourite\nthis year. A duet about a couple going through a breakup, it\u2019s a bit like Gotye\u2019s \u2018Somebody\nThat I Used To Know\u2019 with hints of Amy Winehouse. Trust me, it works. Estonia failed to\nqualify for the final last year, but this year they\u2019re sure to be there and I think we\u2019ll see them place in\nthe top 5. They\u2019ve got my vote!\nItaly are part of the Big Five, meaning they automatically qualify for the final, where we\u2019ll see Il\nVolo sing \u2018Grande Amore\u2019. A modern-day Three Tenors, Il Volo is a young, operatic pop trio\nthat was formed on an Italian TV singing contest in 2010. \u2018Grande Amore\u2019 is a dark, brooding,\npowerful operatic ballad and I love it. It really stands out and will surely stay in the minds of the\nvoters as they reach for their phones.\nFinland\nNil points! The British entry are practising their game faces.

Not for these girls\nPhoto: Celine Sciamma/Studiocanal\nThis week in Film: Terminator Genisys\nThe latest film in director Celine\nSciamma\u2019s \u2018Trilogy of Youth\u2019\nis Girlhood (Bande des Filles),\na coming-of-age story set on the\nhousing projects bordering Paris.\nThe title of this French-language\nfilm directly translates as Girl Gang\n\u2013 but the English film title knowingly\nreferences Richard Linklater\u2019s\ncritically lauded 2014 film, Boyhood,\nwhich similarly focused on issues on\nadolescence and identity.\nIn Girlhood, Karidja Tour\u00e9 plays\nsixteen year old Marieme, a quiet\nschoolgirl who cares for her two\nyounger sisters.\nLife isn\u2019t easy; having been refused\nthe opportunity to attend high school\non spurious grounds, Marieme must\nquickly decide what to make of her\nlife when the only other options\nappear to be becoming a cleaner,\na drug dealer, a young mum or a\nprostitute.\nHer own mother is largely absent,\nworking long hours at a cleaning job\nwhich must provide for four children;\nand for a father figure she has only a\nbullying, older brother.\nMarieme\u2019s life seems to be void of\nfriendship or relief, revolving solely\naround family duties.\nIt is at this point that she is adopted\nby a group of three fearless, rowdy\ngirls Fily (Mari\u00e9tou Tour\u00e9), Adiatou\n(Lindsay Karamoh) and their\nenigmatic leader, Lady (Assa Sylla).\nUnusually for French cinema,\nthe cast are predominantly black\nactors. In interviews, Sciamma has\nmentioned the paucity of black\nstudents at French drama schools,\nwhich resulted in her using street-casting to bring her characters to life.\nAll of the performances are\nmagnetic; the four lead actresses\nhad no previous experience yet their\ncharisma and on-screen presence\ncarries the film.\nKaridja Tour\u00e9 is captivating as\nMarieme, whose outwardly shy\ndemeanour masks a quick witted\nand resourceful survivor. You only\never want Marieme to be alright, but\nlike so many other young people, her\ndazzlingly depressing set of prospects\nleaves her clearly vulnerable.\nThe boys on the estate also travel\nin packs. They sit on low walls and\nstairways like sentries, watching\neverything, ready to shame the girls\u2019\nappearance and behavior.\nWhen they are in their own bubble,\nshielded from the male gaze, it\nseems that the girls can do anything.\nThey are funny, loud and charming,\nwhen they want to be.

He spoke about\nhis work in the field of embryology,\nand how his religious background\nmade him more able to engage with\ncritics of this controversial research.\nHe told the audience that the sense of\nwonder that comes from religion has\nbeen a source of great motivation for\nhim; and that his grandfather, a Chief\nRabbi, was one his inspirations for\npursuing a career as a scientist.\nThe debate was opened up to\nmembers of the audience, who\nraised a variety of points ranging\nfrom the relationship of Eastern\nreligions to science to the possible\neffect preconceptions due to religious\nbelief having an effect on the lines of\nenquiry that scientists may take.\nDebating Society President Niall\nJeffrey told Felix, \u201cwe are extremely\npleased to see so many people coming\nto watch and get involved in the\ndebate, which has been our most\nsuccessful public event to date.

Split into three acts, the\nRoyal Ballet resident choreographer\nWayne McGregor\u2019s first full-length\nballet corresponds to three separate\nstories by Woolf \u2013 Mrs Dalloway\n(1925), Orlando (1928) and The Waves\n(1931).\nCalled back from retirement at\n52 to carry the central character of\nthe first and third acts, Ferri is a\ncommanding presence on stage, her\ndark hair and eyes and beautifully\nexpressive body embodying the\nmelancholy of Clarissa Dalloway, the\neponymous upper-class housewife\nfrom what is arguably Woolf\u2019s most\nfamous work. It is clear, however,\nthat the ballet is as much about the\ncharacters as the author herself, as\nwe feel her presence shift in and out\nof Clarissa, weaving her personal\nnarrative into her heroine. In the\nthird act when Ferri returns, she is\nWoolf herself, both an outsider and\nparticipant to her own story as she\ndances around her struggles with\nmental illness and eventual suicide.\nFerri delivers a performance that is\nboth technically superb and intensely\nemotional, lending a deep sincerity to\nMcGregor\u2019s choreography.\nThe first act follows the narrative\nof Mrs Dalloway closely, and it is\npossible to identify the heroine\ndancing with her husband while\nobserving her younger self. The stage\nis anchored by three large wooden\nframes that the characters dance in\nand out of, gliding through the past\nand present, through fiction and\nreality. In a parallel world, mentally\ndisturbed war veteran Septimus,\nplayed by a captivating Edward\nWatson, tries to free himself from\nhis own shell-shocked mind while\nholding on to his wife, who is all that\nis left of his tenuous link to reality.\nIt is a sparse act, with not more than\nfive dancers on stage at any one time,\nbut the result is an intensely affecting\none, helped by Max Richter\u2019s\nbeautifully flowing score.\nIt is unfortunate that the three acts\nwere not more connected to each\nother \u2013 it seemed instead like three\nseparate mini ballet performances.\nAfter the very moving first act,\nthe second, supposedly based on\nOrlando, came as a surprise, with\nlaser beams slicing through space\nand time and troops of androgynous\ndancers marching up and down the\nstage in golden bodysuits complete\nwith ruffs and tutus. It was more of\nan impression of Orlando\u2019s time-travelling narrative and gender\nfluidity, rather than a faithful\ninterpretation. McGregor, known\nprecisely for such post-modern takes\non ballet, seemed to use energetic\nmovements both individually and\ncollectively to capture the relentless\npace of the novel. While interesting\nat first, the act got repetitive\nquickly, and seemed to try too hard\nto be avant-garde. All the fancy\nembellishments only distracted from\nthe dancers themselves. At times,\nthe score here also bordered on\nunpleasant, with whirring electronic\nnotes and techno beats that, together\nwith the flashing neon beams made\nthe theatre feel like a giant club.\nThe Waves is one of Woolf\u2019s most\nexperimental novels, revolving\naround the narratives of its six\ncharacters from childhood till old\nage, exploring their individual stories\nbut also their collective experience of\nlife. Weaving in Woolf\u2019s own story\ninto this act was apt, I felt, especially\nsince the novel was said to be inspired\nby the lives of those around her. The\nact begins with a poignant reading\nof Woolf\u2019s suicide note, as a slow-motion movie of waves crashing onto\nthe shore plays atmospherically in\nthe background throughout. Young\ndancers blended in with older ones,\ncreating a fabric of the journey of\nlife, moving across the stage like the\nmotion of the tide. Ferri\u2019s Woolf\noccasionally joins in their dance, and\neven dances with the characters, but\nmostly we feel her troubled presence\nbeing tossed around the human\nwaves around her, as she decides,\neventually, to drown herself, just like\nthe character Rhoda in her story.\nWoolf was known as a literary\ninnovator of her time, part of the\ninfluential Bloomsbury group of\nartists and intellectuals. The three\nstories chosen in this ballet were all\nradical in their own way, whether\nit was the all-in-a-day stream of\nconsciousness narrative of Mrs\nDalloway, the gender non-conforming\nand time-travelling Orlando, or the\ninterwoven narratives of The Waves.\nIn a way, the unconventionality\nof Woolf Works captures this spirit\nof challenging boundaries with its\ninteresting use of words, recordings,\nmovies, sets, and lighting. Ballet is\nalso a very technically demanding\nart form requiring precision, which\nmakes it a fascinating medium\nto experiment with freedom and\noriginality within structure.\nAn enjoyable, albeit long,\nperformance with an interesting\ntake on the author and her works,\nWoolf Works indeed has moments of\nbrilliance, but it still has some way to\ngo in being tastefully experimental\nwithout overwhelming the senses\nwith attention-seeking gimmicks.\nWoolf Works is on at the Royal Opera\nHouse until 26th\nMay. Tickets from \u00a34.\nAvailable online.\n\"It\u2019s a bold,\nmixed-media\ntheatrical\nexperiment\nwith dance\nas its main\nact\"\n\"Woolf\nWorks\ncaptures\na spirit of\nchallenging\nboundaries\nwith its\nstagecraft\"\nA scene from The Royal Ballet\u2019s Woolf Works Photo: Tristram Kenton\n\n"

For those of you that didn\u2019t\nbrave last Thursday night, we\u2019ve\nclarified the developments so far, and\nhighlighted what you need to know\nabout your next government.\nFirstly, the basics\nWe woke up to a somewhat surprising\nConservative 12-seat majority last\nFriday. Meanwhile, Scotland saw a\nlandslide victory for the SNP, Wales\nremained majority Labour and\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s DUP defended\ntheir share of the seats. The Liberal\nDemocrats suffered a catastrophic\nelection result across the United\nKingdom, and UKIP only won one\nseat despite winning nearly four\nmillion votes.\nThe Conservatives increased their\nshare of the vote by 0.8%, while\nLabour won 1.5% more votes and\nthe SNP surge resulted in 3.1%\nmore votes amongst all of them in\nthe UK. The Lib Dems lost 15.2%\nof their votes. It is incredibly rare\nfor governments to increase their\nparliamentary representation after\nre-election.. No one was expecting this\nkind of result.\nThe voting turnout of the registered\nelectorate was 66.1%, a modest\nimprovement on 2010\u2019s 65.1% across\nthe UK\nThis election was a big one. The\nstakes were incredibly high; with\nthe size of the state, the union\nof the United Kingdom and our\nposition in the European Union\non the ballot, and with the added\nnuanced policy debates around the\nNHS, immigration, housing, our\nnuclear defences, the continuation of\nausterity and political reform, there\nwas certainly something for everyone\nto sink their teeth into.\nBut for all the impact that the\nresults will have, you would be\nforgiven for thinking this was a\npretty standard issue election. All the\nparties ran remarkably risk averse,\nsterilised and sometimes downright\ndull election campaigns, with no real\nstand-out moments.\nPlaying it safe\nTo top it all off, after all the sound\nand fury, the polls didn\u2019t seem to\nbudge after more than a month of\ncampaigning, much to the annoyance\nof journalists looking for a headline.\nThe Conservatives were edging it\nin the polls for the last few weeks of\nthe campaign, during which time\nthe various party leaders universally\nopted for a very stage-managed\nappeal to voters through the media,\nwith virtually no walkabouts among\nthe general public and a great deal of\nbackroom spin.\n\u201cIt was the shy Tories that\nwon it\u201d\nImmediately after the polls closed at\n22:00, the exit poll indicated a huge\nsurge for the Conservatives. The\nprediction stood at: Conservatives316, Labour - 239, SNP - 58, Liberal\nDemocrats - 10, Plaid Cymru - 4,\nGreens - 2, UKIP - 2, Other - 19.\nIf this was the case, all the polls\nleading up to the election were\nseriously off. However we soon\nfound out that even this poll didn\u2019t\nhighlight just how comfortably\nthe Conservatives were to take the\nmajority.\nSoon after the results for each of the\n650 seats started trickling in, it didn\u2019t\ntake the nation long to realise Labour\nwas about to suffer crushing blow\nafter crushing blow. Labour\u2019s election\ncampaign chief, and shadow Foreign\nSecretary, Douglas Alexander lost to\na 20-year-old SNP candidate, shortly\nfollowed by the fall of Scottish Labour\nleader Jim Murphy.\nTo add huge insult to injury, the\nShadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who\nwould have become the second\nmost powerful man in a Labour\ngovernment, lost his Morley and\nOutwood seat. His wife, Yvette\nCooper, won her nearby constituency.\nNick Clegg retained his seat in\nSheffield Hallam, but in a shock\nresult, Vince Cable, who was the\nSecretary of State for Business,\nInnovation and Skills from 2010 to\n2015, lost his Twickenham seat to\nthe Conservatives.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 25\n15.05.2015\nFELIX\nEditor C\u00e9cile Borkhataria\nFashion\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ncreating a Camper shoe begins at the\ncompany\u2019s design studios in Mallorca,\nSpain. Manufacturing then takes\nplace in one of its factories in China,\nIndonesia or Vietnam. Although\nthe brand used to manufacture its\nshoes on site in Mallorca, like many\nproduct-based businesses, it seized\nthe opportunity of manufacturing\nits shoes at a much lower cost in East\nAsia.\nThe opening of the exhibition\nfeatures a video illustrating the\npainstakingly detailed precision\nrequired to make a Camper\nshoe. Whilst some aspects of\nmanufacturing are mechanized, such\nas sewing the sole of the shoe onto\nits base, many others, such as cutting\nout individual pieces of leather for\nconstructing the shoe, are done by\nhand. Contrary to what I expected\nfrom a mass production factory in\nAsia, this video made the process look\nlike it was taking place in an artisanal\nshoe shop in Spain. Interestingly,\nwhilst making a pair of Camper shoes\nusually only takes a few hours in the\nfactory, up to 300 people may be\ninvolved in the making of one single\nshoe.\nTwo seasonal collections of Camper\nshoes are designed every year, with\neach collection containing around\n500 shoes which are produced by\nmany of the companies designers,\nas well as external collaborators, in\nresponse to a design brief set by the\ncompany\u2019s creative director, now\nFrench designer Romain Kremer.\nThese briefs usually specify the\nstyle, mood and colour palette for\nthat season, whilst also predicting\n\"No one\nstore\ndesign is\nthe same .\"\n\"Up to 300\npeople may\nbe involved\nin the\nmaking of\none single\nshoe.\"\nProtocell trainers.

What\nmakes Camper unique is that at the\ndesign stage, and all the way through\nmanufacturing, the design of a shoe\nis based on \u2018the last\u2019, a model of the\nhuman foot. The lasts are made by\na team of technicians at Camper,\nadvising the design team on comfort\nfor the wearer. The same last used\nduring design is also used during\nmanufacturing, to ensure that\nthe actual shoe fits the foot in the\nintended way.\nThe flagship product of the brand\nremains the Pelotas, the company\u2019s\nmost distinctive shoe design. Over\nten million pairs of Pelotas have been\nsold since they were first launched\nby Camper in 1995. The design was\ninspired by vintage American sports\ntrainers, and its name means \u2018balls\u2019 in\nSpanish, referencing the 87 indented\nballs on the sole of a Pelota shoe\nAnother of Camper\u2019s most famous\ndesigns is arguably the \u2018Wabi\u2019,\nmeaning \u2018peasant\u2019 or \u2018rustic\u2019 in\nJapanese. It is meant in a sense\nof simplicity, a modesty with no\npretension. Wabi shoes are made for\nindoor use, placing an emphasis on\nsustainability in the materials they\u2019re\nmade of. They are directed to all\nages, for use throughout all seasons\nof the year. The first prototypes of\nthe Wabi were made using hemp and\ncoconut, but now, a standard Wabi\u2019s\nsole is composed of recycled rubber\nand its upper is usually made of wool.\nFollowing the Wabi\u2019s, the next iconic\ndesign showcased are the \u2018Twins\u2019.\nThese shoes, first introduced in the\nearly 90\u2019s, were unique in that they\nwere non-identical pairs of shoes,\nwhich were revolutionary at the time.\nAcross its product range, Camper has\ncollaborated with many different\ndesigners, including celebrated\nSpanish artist Joan Mir\u00f3 on a pair of\ngraphic \u2018twins\u2019.\nThe exhibition forays into Camper\u2019s\nvarious advertising campaigns, past\nand present. The company uses\nadverts in a humorous way, whilst\nalso questioning mass consumerism.\nMany of its adverts avoid using\ndirect images of shoes, and most use\nEnglish instead of Spanish, appealing\nto a global audience. One famous\nadvertising poster, created by Guix\u00e9\nin 2002, bore the slogan \u201cNo los\ncompres si no los necesitas\u201d, meaning\n\u201cDon\u2019t buy it if you don\u2019t need it\u201d.\nThis paradoxical take on advertising\nemphasizes that Camper is different,\nand is as much a maverick lifestyle\nbrand as it is a global shoe retailer.\nIn line with Campers position\nas a lifestyle brand, the company\nlaunched their \u2018walking society\u2019\nadvertising campaign in 2001. The\ncampaign\u2019s slogan \u201cWalk, Don\u2019t Run\u201d,\nemphasizing the conflict between the\nslow pace of the rural world and the\nfast pace of urban reality, bringing\nthem together.\nFinally, the exhibition explores the\npotential future of walking, looking\nat the ways in which technological\nand sociological developments might\nchange the landscape for everyday\npedestrians. An array of speculative\ndesign ideas look at new directions\nand possibilities for pedestrians.\nFor example, researcher Shamees\nAden studies protocells, an area of\nsynthetic biology that may offer new\napproaches to footwear design in the\nfuture. Protocells become semi-living\nsubstances through the manipulation\nof their chemical structures, and an\n\u2018amoeba trainer\u2019 designed by Aden\nsuggests that these cells could mould\naround the foot, creating a type of\nsecond skin shoe. As this part of the\nexhibition focuses on \u2018life on foot\u2019 as a\nwhole, it looks at innovation in space\nsuit design. It showcases images of\nnewly developed space suits that look\nlike a wetsuit rather than a traditional\nbulky space suit, allowing a more\nseamless walking experience in Space.\nThe final parts of the exhibitions take\na look at changing city landscapes as\na result of technological innovation\nand changing walking habits. The\nexhibit displays an interactive screen\nshowing the number of average daily\nsteps taken in cities around the world.\nIt shows that Tokyo is one of the\nworld\u2019s most active cities in terms of\naverage steps per day, due in part, no\ndoubt, to the lack of efficient public\ntransportation and the reliance on\ncars for displacement. By contrast,\nLos Angeles has some of the lowest\nlevels of steps taken. Such insights\nhave led city planners to investigate\nthe possibility of widespread \u2018express\nwalkways\u2019 becoming mainstream\nin cities, similar to flat moving\nwalkways in airports. These could\nresemble motorways for pedestrians,\nwith shoe repair stations, food shops\nand other amenities along the way.\nThese ideas may change the landscape\nof cities as we know them in the near\nfuture, whilst redefining the footwear\nfashion sphere.\nThe exhibition is open to the public at\nLondon\u2019s Design Museum from the 13th\nof May till the 1st\nof November, located\nat123 Shad Thames. Student tickets cost\n\u00a39.75 and adult tickets are \u00a313. Tickets\ngive access to three exhibitions in the\nmuseum, which is located just south of\nthe river. The closest tube stations are\nTower Hill and London Bridge.\nCamper has been in business for 40 years.

The police described\nthe protest as an \u201cunplanned\u201d\ndemonstration.\nA police investigation is also\nunder way after the phrase \u201cFuck\nTory Scum\u201d was graffitied onto\nthe Women\u2019s War Memorial in\nWhitehall. This comes just as\nthe Queen attended a service of\nthanksgiving at Westminster Abbey\nto mark the 70th\nanniversary of VE\nDay \u2013 the end of World War Two in\nEurope.\nA Downing Street spokesman\ncondemned the graffiti as \u201ca\ndespicable display of disrespect for\nthose who fought and died for their\ncountry\u201d.\nIn a statement, the Met said that\n12 people were arrested on suspicion\nof violent disorder and three for\nassault on police. Of the 15 arrested,\n14 have been bailed pending further\nenquiries including a full review\nof CCTV footage and a 24-year-old\nman remains in custody after being\narrested on suspicion of assault on\npolice.\nTwo officers were treated at hospital\nafter the clash with protestors, while\nthree other officers were assaulted\nbut did not go to hospital. There\nhave been no reported injuries to any\nprotesters.\nChief Superintendent Gerry\nCampbell said the vast majority of\nprotestors had taken part peacefully,\nbut added that a \u201csmall minority\u201d had\nbeen intent on causing disorder.\n\u201cWe have launched an\ninvestigation into criminal damage\nto the Women in World War Two\nMemorial. This is particularly\nabhorrent considering we are\ncelebrating the 70th\nanniversary of VE\nDay,\u201d he said.\nA similar, albeit smaller, rally\nagainst austerity took place in Cardiff\nover the weekend. Roughly 200\npeople were protesting, including the\nsinger Charlotte Church.\nIn Bristol on Thursday, thousands\nalso took to the streets in a more\npeaceful anti-austerity demo.\nCampaigners turned out in droves\nto oppose the \u00a312bn welfare cut the\nConservative party plans in a bid to\neradicate the deficit by 2018.\nAlthough there were no arrests,\nmajor traffic delays were caused\naround the centre of Bristol\nthroughout the evening.\nThe former leader of the\nConservatives on Bristol City Council,\nPhoto: BBC News\nPeter Abraham, told the BBC he was\ndisappointed the march was taking\nplace.\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept this word austerity,\u201d\nhe said.\n\u201cThis is the far left and the rag-tag\nand bobtail of protest groups coming\ntogether and just making a fuss.\n\u201cPerhaps they are doing it because\nthey don\u2019t like the [election] result\nbut the people spoke and that\u2019s\ndemocracy.\u201d\nMore protests are being planned\nfor the following months, with The\nPeople\u2019s Assembly against Austerity\nhosting events online to encourage\nprotesting in May and June. The\ngroup is also thought to be behind the\nLondon protests that took place last\nweekend, although that hasn\u2019t been\nconfirmed.\nThe People\u2019s Assembly against\nAusterity have posted an event\non facebook for May 27th\n, calling\nfor a protest starting outside of\n10 Downing Street and moving\ndown to the Emmanuel Centre in\nWestminster during the evening of\nthe Queen\u2019s Speech.\nThey have also called for a National\nDemonstration on June 20th\n, starting\noutside the Bank of England. The\ngroup states: \u201cWith the Tories going it\nalone in government we know exactly\nwhat to expect.\n\u201cMore nasty, destructive cuts to the\nthings ordinary people care about \u2013\nNHS, the welfare state, education and\npublic services.\u201d\nDriving Lessons\nFor Imperial Students\n5\nLessons\nonly\n\u00a395\nA special offer for Imperial Students from Denis Smyth\n\u2022 Driving Standards Agency (DSA) Accredited Instructor\n\u2022 Mock Test Examiner\n\u201cHaving always been apprehensive about learning to drive, especially in\nLondon - learning with Denis gave me the confidence and skill to pass my\ndriving test first time round.\u201d\nLlywellyn Edwards, Royal College of Music Student.\nTo make inquiries or book lessons, call 07808 610 898\n\u201cDennis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from\ncompletely inexperienced and utterly hopeless driving up to the standard to\npass their test. He is always calm and his comments are constructive; his\nknowledge of London and his knack of engineering driving routes that test\nthe learner make the lessons more than worth it.
