    "content": "to Ed iI ori a Teaching Standards\nMy remarks about teaching\nstandards in FELIX last\nweek seem to have irritated\nsome people. I was not\ntrying to defend\nGovernment cuts in\nfunding for higher\neducation. The cuts have\naffected undergraduate\nlabs. They have affected\nresearch. They have\nresulted in courses being\ncut. I was attacking certain\nacademics inability to\nteach. Most IC students will\nhave been to lectures that\nhave been\nincomprehensible because\nthe lecturer has been\ninarticulate, produced\nunreadable slides for the\noverhead projector or\nrushed through new\nmaterial at an amazing rate.\nThis isn't because of\nGovernment cuts. It's because they haven't put\nenough effort into course\npreparation.\nPI\nCongratulations on an\nexcel lant raid. I thought it\nReligions\nDifferent\nDear Sir,\nCan I thank Andrew Dunn\nfor his letter published in\nlast week's FELIX. He made\nsome good points,\nalthough I don't agree with\nall of them. However, I think I should point out one\nmistake. Andrew said that,\n'The Christian would\nsay...that all religions\nbelieve in the same God'.\nAlthough this is thought to\nbe an enlightened and\nfashionable thing to\nbelieve, there are several\nreasons why I believe it's untrue. First of all it's illogical. How can all\nreligions lead to the same\nGod when they are so\ndifferent? The God of\nHinduism is plural and\nimpersonal but the God of\nIslam is singular and\npersonal. The God of\nwas very funny.\nValentines Day\nRemember to get all those\nsmall ads in for next week's Valentine's issue. They're\nfree and need to be in the\nFELIX Office by 1.30pm on\nMonday.\nCredits\nThanks to Dave Jones,\nDave Clements, Sean\nMacRae, J Martin Taylor,\nDave Griffiths, Alan Rose,\nJim Clayden, Sunny Bains,\nMark Cottle, Bill Goodwin,\nMark Hunter, Richard\nSmith, Pete Hobbis,\nRosemary Hosking, Kamala\nSen, John Burgess, Jane\nSpiegel, Chris Stapleton,\nNige Atkinson, Aaron\nKotcheff, Chris Edwards,\nTony Spencer, Pete Wilson,\nDave Kingston and anyone\nI 've forgotten. Special\nthanks to all the people\nwho got up early on\nMonday and Tuesday\nmornings.\nChristianity is the Creator\nof the world, but the divine\nof Buddhism is not\npersonal and not creative.\nThe goal of all existence in\nBuddhism is nirvana-existance, but in\nChristianity to know God\nand enjoy him forever.\nMaybe the greatest\ndifference is between the\nBible which asserts that no\none can save himself and\nmake himself pleasing to\nGod, however hard he tries;\nand almost all other faiths\nwhich assert that by\nkeeping to their teaching a man will be saved, or\nreborn, or made whole or\nreach fulfillment.\nSecondly, it is impossible\nfor two reason. First, if\nthere is a god then he is\nthe source of man and\neverything around him and\nlord over all human life.\nThe prophet Isaiah spoke\nof God 'whom did he\nconsult for his\nenlightenment and who\ntaught him the path of\nknowledge and showed him\nthe way of understanding?\nBehold, the nations are like\na drop from a bucket, and\nare accounted as dust on\nthe scales.' If this is the\nGod we're talking about\nthen how can we expect to\nfind him? Can the cup\nunderstand the potter who\nmade it? Whether we like it\nor not, man cannot find\nGod however hard and\nlong he searches. Religion\nthen is bound to fail, if by it\nwe mean man's search for\nGod. What we need is not a mosaic made up from the\nvarious chinks of light\ndiscovered in different\nreligions, but for the sun to\nrise. And that is exactly\nwhat Christianity offers.\nThe Bible tells us not of\nman's search for God, but\nGod's search for man.\nThe second reason it's impossible is because of\nthe problem of our own\nnature. Man sins, failing not\nonly to meet God's standards but often his\nown. Paul, the writer of\nmuch of the New\nTestament, comes to the\nconclusion at the end of his\nindictment of Roman\nsociety that 'There is none\nrighteous, no, not one.\nThere is none that\nunderstands and seeks\nafter God'. God shows us\nup for the self-centred\nbeings we are and so many\nof us avoid Him, dreading\nthe thought that he might\ncome close to us. Our\nsinful nature and his\nperfect infinite nature form\na barrier between Him and\nus, which we can't overcome...but there's no\nreason for God not to\novercome it, and that is just\nwhat the Bible claims Jesus\ndid. He came to earth to\novercome the barrier and\nshow us what God is like.\nMy reason for writing at\nsuch length is not to start\nany interfaith arguments-that is rarely helpful. Rather\nI want to point out that the\nidea of all religions being\nthe same thing in the long\nrun just doesn't square up\nwith the facts. Therefore we\nshouldn't use it as an\nexcuse for not thinking\nabout God.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Pettman\nWell Taught\nDear Sir\nI would be interested in any\njustification you would be\nprepared to give of your\ncomments last week about\nthe apparent low teaching\nstandards at IC. In my\nexperience of IC to date\nteaching standards have\nusually surpassed my\nexpectations and could\ncertainly not be described\nas 'low'. I cannot help\nfeeling that some of the\ncomments in last week's editorial were, to say the\nleast, unfair to our lecturers\nand probably no more than\na result of a natural (and\nuniversal) inclination to\ncriticise teachers.\nStandards at IC are good\nand always getting better.\nIf people don't find\nlecturers interesting then\nit's probably because they\nare not interested and\nshould have taken a different subject. However\nany subject will gt times get\ntedious, study is work not a game and this can't be\nblamed on the lecturers.\nTo say that funding levels\ndon't effect teaching\nstandards is not only\nultimately wrong but also a dangerous attitude\nespecially with a government prepared to cut\nwhere and whenever it can\nget away with it. With cuts\nin their wages and criticism\nfrom (some) students. I sincerely hope that morale\namongst lecturers will\nnever slip to that amongst\nschool teachers.\nRemember the U GM voted overwhelmingly to\nsupport the AUT in its\ncause.\nYours sincerely\nLucien Parkin\nPhysics 1\nFelicity Rant\nDear Sir,\nI presume that FELIX is a publication of an English\nCollege. Therefore why do\nwe have ranting American\nfemales writing the Below\nthe Belt column, inserting\nuseless American humour\ninto the column? How can\nshe have the gall to call\npeople kids when she's younger than most people\nat College? And who is she\nto talk about living in sin?\n(See issue of January\n10th \u2014incidentally\nincorrectly dated January\n11th).I am surprised that\nStudent Services let her\nshack up with 'Superwimp'\nJ Martin Taylor in single\naccommodation! I say get\nrid of Felicity the Catty! It\nis far too early for her to be\ntrying for FELIX Sabbatical\ncredibility! To sign off, I will just say that FELIX is\ngetting nearly as boring as\nGuildsheet, and is just\nbecoming a magazine for\nFELIX hacks.

Naturally to meet\nthese demands, several\norganisations have been\nformed to cater solely for\nholidays for the physically\nhandicapped. Nearly all of\nthem are registered\ncharities (ie non-profit\nmaking) and are run by\nvolunteers.\nOne charity in particular is\n'Young Disabled on\nHoliday' (YDH). It\norganises group holidays\nfor 16-30 year olds, lasting\nusually for one week. Not\nonly does it give the\ndisabled person a holiday,\nit also gives the people who\nnormally look after the\ndisabled person (often\nrelatives) a welcome break.\nYDH is now entering its\n16th year and so far has\noffered 70 holidays ranging\nfrom boating to a fortnight\nin America, to camping in\nGermany to Christmas in\nGuildford(!) to Lanforce\nand all the possibilities in\nbetween.\nOn all these holidays\neach physically disabled\nperson has at least one\nable-bodied helper who\nprovides assistance\ndepending on the extent of\nthe disability. This will vary\nfrom tying shoelaces,\nwalking up and down stairs\nto full physical care ie\nwashing, toilet, feeding etc.\nA sense of humour is\nessential.\nIt can be very demanding\non helpers but always very\nsatisfying and experienced\nhelpers are always on hand\nwhen necessary and\nusually when not. The\nemphasis is always to have\nas much fun as possible\nsince it is a holiday.\nIt also guarantees to\nprovide a valuable and\nun forget able experience!\nInevitably the limited age\ngroup means we are always\nlooking for new people, but\nin particular helpers. To tempt people, YD H plan the\nfollowing holidays in 1986:\nJersey at Easter, Russia\nin May, Camping in Paris\nJuly, Exeter in August,\nTunisia in September.\nFinances are always a problem and since helpers\nare charged a fraction of\nthe cost of the Holiday, we\nare continually fundraising.\nTo this end we hope to\nhold a sponsored 12 hour\nDisco in College on 22/23\nMarch, at 8pm8 am to raise\nfunds.

He, with a few\nother members of the\nIslington Tasmanian\nWorkers Collective, create\nclothes made up entirely of\nthe rubber fan belts found\nin 1950s vacuum cleaners\nImported from Illinois, and\nsell them at Camden\nMarket.\n\"We've taken vacuum\ncleaners into the\nmainstream,\" says Steve\n(one of the garageland\nband\u2014Electrolux Babies).\n\"It used to be just the\nfetishists Into them \u2014 real\nheavy stuff, you know.\nKitchen Hoover orgies, sink\nplungers, the lot. But now\nits real fashion \u2014 just like\nthese vinyl still e to boots\nwith matching manacles\nI 've got on.\"\nNot into fan belts? Not to\nworry, London street-markets have much more to\noffer. Sticking with Camden\nMarket, where else can you\nfind the latest bootleg from\n'Dinner Zamfurshreift', the\nband from Upper Saxony\nwho pile into railway\nbridges with Black and\nDecker hammer drills\n(Bosch drills don't convey\nquite the same depth of\nmeaning, apparently)?\nSuch obscurity may not be\nto taste, but at least one of\nthe many stalls are bound\nto have that LP of Aretha\nFranklin guesting with the\nNolan Sisters, having\nrecorded songs with just\nabout everyone else.\nWhereas most markets\nwind up selling the trousers\neven Marks and Spencer\nwon't touch, Camden has\nthe advantage of having\npeople sell their own\ndesigns, among the endless\nracks of good secondhand\nclothes. The same goes for\nKensington Market, which\nscores over Camden being\nboth Indoors and just up\nthe road \u2014 just in case you\ndon't like running Into\ngangs of very apprehensive\nmetal monkeys every five\nminutes, at this time of\nyear. The choice of attire In\nboth markets Is incredible,\nespecially if your favourite\ncolours are black and\nday g lo pink.\nFinding both markets Is\ndead easy. Camden market\nis best reached by Camden\nTown tube (Northern Line).\nSimply turn right at the top\nof the escalators and then\nright again onto Camden\nHigh Street. The market is\non the right, just past the\nElectric Ballroom. It is open\nevery Friday, Saturday and\nSunday.\nFurther up the road is\n. . . - f Capital IDEAS\nCamden Lock market,\nwhich opens on just\nSundays, but is very\nworthwhile since it extends\nthe range on show here.\nThis market is essentially\nshrink-wrapped around\nDlngwalls, which is ,\nprobably the best use for\nthat particular club.\nKensington market is in\nKensington High Street,\nbetween the college and\nBarkers. This one opens on\nWednesdays and\nSaturdays.\nIn the words of many,\nmany people, but not\nEugene Zhog, the famed\nAlbanian mountain cycling\nchampion, this week I witnessed the end of one\nera and the beginning of\nanother. The era that had\nended was the live career\nof the group Here & Now,\nat the pokey little hole\nwhich had the\npretentiousness to call\nItself Dingwalls Dancehall.\nHere & Now are perhaps\nnot the best known of\ngroups but their personal\nphilosophy and their rather\nspecial following make\nthem worthy of mention.\nNot having taken a very\ncommercial attitude they\nwill probably be unknown\nto most people at college,\nand those that have heard\nof them will probably\nassociate them with the\nout-and-out hippy group\nGong. This is somewhat\nmisleading although Here &\nNow had their roots in that\nera. They were the epi to my of the alternative group,\nplaying many free gigs and\nfestivals including regular\nappearances at Stonehenge\nalong with the likes of\nHawkwind and the Enid.\nBut their sound which was\nrhythmic In the same way\nas the Police drew them\none of the most varied\naudiences I have seen for\nany group. The previous\nFriday I saw them play a packed gig at Bournemouth\nTown Hall which was a.++.+ large and excellent venue.\nSo It came as something of\na surprise that they should\nchoose Dingwalls for their\nfarewell gig and to film with\nhigh quality equipment at\nsuch a poor venue. The\nmain point of all this Is to\nsay what a rotten venue\nDingwalls is. It seems to be\ncursed with Incurably\nunbalanced sound and of\nsuch a size that most pub\nvenues seem like\ncathedrals. Not only that\nbut the layout seems\ndesigned to make the worst\npossible use of the\navailable space, It certainly\nleft me with about three\ninches to stand in. On this\n.occ a ssl on the atmosphere\nI( about 30% marijuana\n\"smoke by my estimate)\nmade up for the venue. The\nonly reasons I can see for\nDingwalls survival is that It\nis located In trendy\nCamden Lock and exists in\na city where there Is a remarkable lack of decent\nmedium sized venues.\nOne possible sign of\nhope for up and coming\ngroups Is the Bull and Gate\nat Kentish Town, 100 yards\nfrom the tube. Here on\nTuesday I saw the London\ndebut of Half Man, Half\nBiscuit who have been\nraved about in previous\narticles.\nThe Bull has a larg ish hall built onto It where\nevery Tuesday and\nWednesday they are aiming\nto run a thing called the\nTimebox. They aim to\npresent each night a known\ngroup who are still on their\nway up along with a couple\nof relative unknowns. They\npromote gigs In\nconjunction with Rough\nTrade Records and are also\nadvertising for people to\nsend them demo tapes\nwhich seems a commendable approach.\nBut back to Half\nMan, Half Biscuit who I'm glad to say seem to have\nbecome a minor cult after\nour discovery of their\nalbum 'Back in the DHSS'\n(what do you mean 'John\nPeel'?). In fact neither the\nover capacity crowd nor\nthe group seemed to know\nexactly what to expect of\nthe set which consisted\nessentially of the Peel\nsession material plus the\nalbum. Still they could do\nnothing wrong and could\nhave played encores all\nnight. It will be interesting\nto see if they can follow up\ntheir Camberwick Green\ngoes ranting punk debut\nwith something equally as\nstrong.\n* Another gig at the\nTimebox worth going to If\nyou are Into psychedelic\npunk or music of a similar\ndescription, Is Leather Nun,\nplus Zodiac Mlndwarp on\nthe 25th February.\nOn to other venues, I have been asked to\nmention the ever worthy\nCabaret Voltaire who are\nplaying the Town and\nCountry Club on the 11th and 12th February. This\ntime the band has been\ndescribed as being able to\n'turn the dancefloor Into a minefield' actually have a support, Rory McLeod,\nInstead of the usual\nmelange of videos.\nThe Cramps have\nannounced their long\nawaited London dates as\nthe 14th and 15th March.\nThese are at the\nHammersmith Odeon \u2014\nwhy on earth they aren't playing the Palais I don't know, as It would seem to\nsuit their style much more.\nThey have an album out\nsometime following the\nconclusion of their hassles\nwith the IRS label and the\ntour is titled 'A Night With\nElvis'. Expect tongues to be\nwedged firmly in cheeks for\na dose of the ultimate In\npsycho-garage shock\nhorror punk and roll.\nWell I'm breaking off now\nto see whether Peel's dicovered a heavy metal\nversion of Hammy Hamster\nwho's going to blow Roland\nRat into oblivion (he'll\nprobably have some late\nsixties power trio refugee\non drums). So I 'll finish by\nsaying that if you ever think\nthere's no time for a break\njust remember the words of\nRaoul Vaneigem who has\nnever to my knowledge\nbeen mountain cycling in\nAlbania\u2014\"This could be\nour last chance to unmake\nhistory.\"\nFELIX Friday 7 February\n\n"

In fact the\npolite clapping of the\naudience is in keeping with\nthe nature of the film, an\nessay on the researched\nand repressed English.\nIn the film the 'real' Alice,\nof Alice in Wonderland\nfame, is now 80 and is\ntravelling to New York to\njoin in the Lewis Carroll\ncentenary celebrations at\nColombia University. On\narrival she is wholly\nunprepared for the free and\neasy ways of the Americans\nand also for the attentions\nof the media.\nThe American\ncharacteristics are\nembodied by the slick\nreporter, Jack Daooan,\nplayed by Peter Gallagher,\nthe weakest of the excellent\ncast, whose unashamed\narrogance and charm\nfinally wins over Alice and\nallows him to become her\nbusiness manager. His\nscheming causes some\nupset to Alice's young\ncompanion, Lucy, who\nfeels that she has been\nused. Nicola Cowper\nperforms extremely well as\nthe shy naive English girl\nshocked into independence\nby the new surroundings\nand behaviour.\nAll the attention she\nreceives because of her\nassociation with the Alice\nin Wonderland causes Alice\nto confront all the\nsuppressed childhood\nmemories of the Reverand\nCharles Dodgson (Lewis\nneed to escape: 'troubles\ncan't always be cured.'\n'Sometimes you have to\ndrea'm' Potter then further\ngoes on to expound the\nimportance of fantasy and\nhow too much detailed\nknowledge can spoil the\ndream. For example when\nMrs Hargreaves is\ndescribing how young\nchildren should behave she\nsays that they should have\n'good light for reading, so\nas not to damage the eyes,\nbut not completely remove\nIM Dream Time.\nCarroll) and the\nWonderland characters\nwho return to haunt her in\na malevolent form. This\nmalevolence is cleverly\nrealised in the appearance\nof the Mad Hatter and Hare\nparticularly, just two of the\nmany creatures made for\nthe film by Jim Henson of\nMuppets fame.\nDennis Potter's script\nskillfully handles both the\nrepression of Lewis Carroll,\nanother brilliant\nperformance from Ian Holm, and his relationship with\nthe young Alice, again a fine performance by Amelia\nShakley, and also the\nEnglish reserve and\nunderstatement epi tomis ed by Mrs Hargraves, yet\nanother fine performance\nthis time by Coral Browne.\nThe story also eloquently\nexplains the behaviour of\nboth Mrs Hargreaves whose\nearly experiences have led\nher to regard love as 'an\nemotion that has always\nfrightened me' and the Rev\nDogson in terms of their\nthe shadows from the\ncorner of the room'.\nDirector Gavin Miller\ntreats Potter's story with\nthe care and respect that it\ndeserves. Go and dream.\nIf you are someone who\nreads the Guardian\nregularly you would have\nnoticed a story on the front\npage of the 26 January\nedition about the\ncorruption of the French\nPolice force and how one\nparticular film was\ninfluential in this. This film\nhas now arrived in Britain\nand is called Le Cop. It is\nblamed because its story is\none that suggests that\ncorruption is the norm\nwithin the police force and\nthat crime pays. It's probably this last reason\nthat has caused the British\ncensor to try and protect\npublic morals by giving the\nfilm an 18 certificate.\nPhillipe Noiret plays a cop with 20 years in the\nPolice force who\nsupplements his income by\nvarious perks, free meals at\na restaurant for ignoring\nillegal gambling, free shirts\nfor ignoring the illegal\nimmigrants in the sweat\nshop, he also does his bit\nto keep the crime figures\ndown by failing to arrest\npickpockets. However one\nday he and his partner\nbungle a job and his\npartner is arrested and\nreplaced by a keen new\ngraduate who is strictly\nhonest and reads the penal\ncode in his lunch break in\npreparation for his exams\nin two years.\nThe rest of the film then\ndetails the attempts of\nPhillipe Noiret to corrupt\nhis new partner in order to\ntry and restore normality to\nthis beat. He proves to be\nall too successful.\nIt is a charming little\ncomedy from Claude Zidi\nwho is noted for such\nthings, and in a lean period\nfor films it is well worth\nconsidering.\nBriefly I'd like to mention\nthat the highly entertaining\nGhostbusters is back on at\nthe wonderful Odeon\nMarble Arch. I think it's still\nthe largest screen in\nEurope and the experience\nof sitting in the stalls (go\nfor the stalls rather than the\ncircle) is fantastic, and\nbesides how many cinemas\ndo you know with\nescalators and tropical fish\nin the bar that only costs\n\u00a32 to students.\ndizzy\nwith\nlove.\ncaptain scarlet\ned cartwright\ncraig k allman i.e. radio\n301m,999 kHz Wednesdays at eight.\nrev\nFELIX Friday 7 February 9\n\n"

    "content": "o Called To The\nBar\nThe Union Bar Is known as the place where rugby\nplayers drop their trousers and sing obscene songs. It\nIs also known as the place where hacks gather and\nOrdinary students are not welcome. FELIX writer (and\ntee-to taller) Sunny Bains went to work in the Bar one\nevening In an attempt to see If It lives up to its\nreputation.\nIn a way I'm sorry to\nhave to admit it, but I like\nthe Union Bar. The night I chose to work there it was\nfull of noisy, drunken men\nand women, and I honestly\ndidn't mind it too much.\nAs everyone knows, quiet\ndrinking is impossible in\nthe Union Bar for about\nhalf the week. This however\nshould eventually change\nwith the opening of a refurbished Lounge Bar,\nwhich the Union has\npromised is on the way\n(when the money is\navailable and we have the\nUnion Bar licence). But\nbetween now and then it is\nimportant not to avoid\ndrinking in the Union Bar.\nAlthough excessive\nbehaviour does sometimes\ntake place, and clothes are\nremoved from time to time,\nnormally it really isn't that\nbad.\nI must admit that when I was asked to work at the\nBar and chose Wednesday\nnight to do it, I had some\npreconceptions of what it\nwas going to be like.\nAlthough the rugby song\nlyrics were not for the\nsqueamish, I didn't find the\nat mosh per e particularly\nsexist (except for the fact\nthat some men commented,\nrightly, on my\nin com pet ance as a bartender).\nThe more valid criticism\nabout the Bar, is that it is a 'hacks bar'. To be honest,\nthis is not the fault of the\nBar Manager or the 'hacks'\nthemselves. If other\nstudents do not make an\neffort to see what the Bar is\nlike under Union control\nand stay away because of\nrumours they've heard,\nthen nothing will change.\nMoore Lyttle is trying very\nhard to make the Bar into a place for all students, and\nhe should be given a chance. The staff are\ncompetent and friendly\n(except when I was there\nas I was in com pet ant, and\nperiodically quite rude),\nand there are promotions\non every week, including\n'Happy Hours' when some\nbeers are 50pa pint. You\nowe it to yourself and your\nUnion to at least try the\nBar.\nIts financial importance\nto the Union is quite\nsignificant. If money is lost\non the Bar, then there will\nbe less money to spend on\nthe Union clubs. Financial\nsuccess, on the other hand,\nwill mean a refurbishment\nof the Lounge Bar and\ntherefore a drinking place\nwhich should appeal to a larger number of students -the choice is yours.\nTom Melliar-Smith is\nhomeless and looking for a bed (whether occupied or\nnot) in which to spent the\nnight. Salty Tom\ndiscovered, to his dismay,\nthat his family had moved\nfrom their house in\nEastbourne to a much\nsmaller flat, and that there\nwas no longer any room at\nthe inn. As tempting as Mr\nMelliar-Smith may be girls,\nI wouldn't take up his\nproposition to readily...\nnever fool around with an\n/Ffily married man.\nRefectory Manager\nNorman Jardine seems to\nhave been having his own\nproblems sleeping recently.\nNorman Nutburger lives\nnext door to wacky\nAcademic Affairs Officer J Martin Taylor. In the last\nfew weeks Mr Jardine has\nbeen kept awake by loud\ngroans coming from Mr\nTaylor's room. On one\noccasion the groans were\nso loud that he left his\nroom to see who was being\nmurdered. Fortunately,\nthough, before he could\nbreak into Mr Photocopier's room the groans became\ngiggles with a definite\nAmerican accent.\nSo how many of you won\n\u00a35 last week in FELIX?\nSorry about the\ndisappointment but as you\nwill already have heard, the\nUniversity College rag (Pi)\ndecided that they couldn't take a bit of criticism and\nso they raided us. Frankly, I was quite flattered that they\nshould take anything I say\nso seriously, but\nnevertheless FELIX felt its\nhonour had been put in\nquestion and so decided it\nhad to retaliate.\nUnfortunately the FELIX\nreturn raid was infinitely\nless successful than the\norg in al. On Monday\nmorning, at the crack of\ndawn, several members of\nthe FELIX staff tried to put\ninserts in this weeks Pi. Pi,\nhowever, had not been\npublished on schedule\nbecause of computer\nfailure and so the merry\nraiders had to get back to\nIC with only the\nsatisfaction of a job well\nbotched. Even more\nridiculous was the fact that\nthey tried again the next\nday, this time only\nmarginally more\nsuccessfully. When they\ngot up to the offices and\nprint unit at the Union\nBuilding they discovered\nthat there was still no sign\nof any Pi in the pipeline.\nPaste-ups and printing\nplates were not ica bly missing, as was the mess\nthat usually accompanies\nany collating. A couple of\nback copies of Pi were\nfound, however, and it was\nthis that made the trip\nworthwhile. By looking\nthrough them it became\nobvious that, even for the\nmost up to date issues of\nPI, my criticisms (and\npraises) still stand...\nWell, since certain people\ndon't love me any more\n(Tony, I love him more than\nyou, please don't be bitter)\nI'd best stop right here.\nExcept to ask: which C CU president is asking for a budget increase of more\nthan 100% this year?\n(Mines silly!).\nWell, lots of love you\ngerri at ric s.. and remember:\nregularity is all important in\nsex, healthy living and\nNewspaper Publishing.\nFriday 7 February FELIX\n\n"

The players\nalternate by putting regular\nsized pennies down onto a square table, the pennies\nmay not overlap one\nanother and may not cross\nthe edge of the table. The\nloser is the first person who\ncannot place a penny on\nthe table. None of the\npennies already placed on\nthe table may be moved at\nany point.\n.There is a good strategy\nto this game such that if\nyou know it, and your\nopponent doesn't, you can\nprobably win. I say\n'probably' because it has\none flaw. What I'd like to\nknow is, what is the\nstrategy? What is its flaw?\nWho will win if both players\nknow the strategy? And is\nthe shape of the table\nimportant?\nAnswers, plus comment\netc by Tuesday lunchtime\nfor the \u00a35 prize. I'd like to\nthank my friend Juan for\nsupplying this week's and\nlast week's problem-thanks\nJuan.\nTricky Triangles\nAll the answers I got this\nweek, except for one,\nclaimed that it was\nimpossible to divide up an\nobtuse triangle into a finite\nnumber of acute triangles,\nand they all provided neat\nproofs or arguments. Well\ndone. The problem is that it\nis possible. The trick is to\ncut off two ends of the\ntriangle and form a pentagon with the\nremainder, as shown (it is\nnot nec essr ilya regular\npentagon).\nThis can be done for any\nobtuse triangle. The proof\nof this is long and boring\nso I wont give it here, but\ntry finding a triangle for\nwhich this doesn't work.\nThe correct answer was\nfrom spock, who isn't eligible for the prize\nanyway, as he is a FELIX\nMegahero\u2014the price of\nstardom, eh?\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022Red Burgundy Tasting The\nquintessence of these fine red wines\nwill impress you, the exquisite farm\nyard flavours will delight you and the\ntutor for this weeks tasting may drive\nsome wild!

    "content": "Football\nGUYS1 sts2 \u2014IC 2nds3 Luke Skywalker could not\nhave masterminded a more\nthrilling and exciting\ncomeback from the dead as\nthe battle-weary troops\nbraved a howling wind and\nsheeting rain to plunder the\npoints from the home of\nthe current league leaders.\nWith the wind at their\nbacks, the injury-ravaged\nIC outfit (Guilds D&D?) struggled to contain the\nsubtle blend of pace, skill\nand aggression exhibited\nby the home forward line.\nOn the few occasions that\nthey breached the solid\ndefensive unit of\nCummings, Wilson, Bradley\nand Day, IC's port\ncustodian Tony 'The Flying\nWhale' Whitehead\nresponded with some\nsurprisingly agile\ngoal keeping. As midfield terriers\nBarrow and Adams began\nto battle and bite, IC's newly formed strike force\nof Houseby and Vanden\nBegin found an increasing\nnumber of half chances\ncoming their way.\nOn the stroke of half time\nHouseby, cramped for\nspace, somehow found an\ninch to curl a goal worthy\nof Dalglish ensuring a buoyant mood as the teams\nlined up for the second\nperiod.\nThe bubble soon burst as\nthe wind-assisted Guys hit\nback with two superb\nstrikes leaving IC once\nagain with the odds\nstacked against them.\nTo the rescue galloped\nAlex 'Steve Heighway'\nLunghi who with blinding\npace created and clinically\nfinished a goal to sav our. As the game ebbed and\nflowed, Engberg was the\nrock on which the home\nattacks floundered, and a magn if ici ent victory was\nsecured when in the dying\nseconds, Vanden Begin\nunleashed an unstoppable\nMark Hughes type volley\nfrom the twenty five yards\nto commence VE Day.\nCelebrations all over again.\nIC 1sts4 St Thomas 1sts1 ICs fourth successive win\nwas achieved with a workman like performance.\nThe game started with IC\nmaintaining their previous\ngood form scoring twice in\nthe first 10 minutes.\nThe first came when Alex\nLunghi's corner was\nheaded powerfully home\nfrom 10 yards by central\ndefender Chris Engbery.\nThe second came when\nPaul Bravery's shot was\nturned over the line by Guy\nPoppy who promptly went\noff with an injured ankle.\nIC went off the ball as St\nThomas' came back into\nthe game but increased\ntheir lead when Shaun\nThomas's cross cum shot\nwas volleyed home by Russ\nCummings' right knee cap\nfrom just outside the\npenalty box.\nThe game was made safe\nwhen Shaun Thomas beat\nthe St Thomas keeper at\nthe near post with a25 year\ndrive.\nSt Thomas' scored a consolation goal with their\nfirst real effort of the game,\na superb 25 yard chip.\nAgain praise must go to\nICs defence with another\nsolid performance in\nlimiting St Thomas' to one\nshot on goal. Tom Dutton's wing wizardry was again in\nevidence in his last game\nfor IC; we all wish him\nsuccess in Geneva.\nRugby\nUCL1 st XV 12 IC 1sts XV 14\nUCL2 nd XV 8 IC 2nd XV 9\nBoth the first and second\nXV were victorious over\nUniversity College last\nWednesday. The first XV\nwon 14points12 while the\nseconds sneaked home 9-8.\nIt was a strange build up\nto the afternoon's exercise\nas the IC players were\ntreated to a guided tour of\nthe Hertfordshire\ncountryside. We all thought\nit was a new kind of\ntherapy until it was\nrevealed that our mentor\nand navigator was an ex-UCL player.\nIn the 1st team game, it\nws UCL who opened the\nscoring in the first half. At\n6-0 down at half time after\nsoaking up most of the\npressure IC played with\ngreat determination and\nwere rewarded with two\nFollard penalties. Excellent\ntackling from Goetz and\nHartley kept UCL pinned in\ntheir own half and fine\nloose play from Hargrove\nand Dancer tore into the\nopposition's defence and\ncreated gaps. With an\nincreasing supply of ball\nand backs were able to\nrelease Secombe on some\ndangerous runs.\nAnderson's charge down\ntry was just deserts.\nLeading 10-6 IC released\nand let UCL in for a try in\nthe corner, duly converted.\nThe last 10 minutes were\nhectic and following a neat\nbreak by Anderson and a clever long pass from Agar,\nSecombe sprinted for the\ncorner to touchdown two\nminutes from time. At 14-12\nUCL were awarded a last\nkick for the game penalty\nfrom wide out, justice was\ndone as the ball harmlessly\npassed the upright.\nIn the 2nd XV's game all\nthe scoring came in the\nsecond half. A good\npenalty from new recruit,\nWatkins and a try for Andy\nCoope converted by\nWatkins saw IC lead 9-0.\nSlack defence allowed UCL to grab two late tries but as\nthey were un converted IC\nhung on to win 9-8.\nAfterwards, Captain Rich\nLadd said it was just the\nfillip the club needed.\nIC 1sts XV 15 South Bank\nPoly 1st XV 6\nAn IC team without many\nof the 1st XV regulars\nentertained South Bank\nPolytechnic on the\nSaturday. With several\nplayers offering their\nservices coming straight\nfrom the Guilds D&D the\natmosphere was a mixture\nof vacancy and German\nRiesling. However once on\nthe field IC played with\naggression and skill,\nplaying with the elements\nIC needed to amass points\nand it was a pushover try\nby JD which set them on\ntheir way-Holland\nconverted. Continually IC\nthreatened to run riot. Andy\nWatson at scrum-half\nmarshalled his troops and\nset them going forward at\npace from incisive breaks\nand astute kicking. A poor\nclearance from the South\nBank full-back allowed\nAgar to gather and j ink through. Follard again\nconverted and slotted over\na penalty to make it 15-0 at\nhalf-time.\nMoving the ball through\nthe hands proved the best\npolicy in the second half\nand only last-ditch tackles\nand poor handling thwarted\nIC's efforts. Somewhat\ninevitably South Bank\ntouched down but it was\ntoo late to affect the\noutcome. IC survived the\nlate pressure to triumph 15\npoints to 6 points. The IC\nforwards deserve special\nmention for their effort;\nnone more than the wing\nforward Lee and Chappel\nwho were everywhere both\nin attack and defence.\nICRUFC Make it l IC 1sts13 \u2014New College 6\nImperial College Rugby\nClub reached the final of\nthe Gulterbridge Cup last\nWednesday by defeating\nNew College 13 pts to 6 in\na clean but hard fought\ngame at Harlington.\nThe team played with a spirit and commitment not\nseen since early last term.\nThe forwards were\noutstanding n the first half-against the elements they\nsc rummaged well and were\nmarauding in the loose,\npreventing the New College\nhalf backs from\nestablishing the attacking\nplatform they required to\nput enough points on the\nboard to defend with any\nconfidence.\nAlthough Imperial\nconceded two early\npenalties in the first quarter\nof the game the final ten\nminutes of the first half\nwere played threatening the\nopponents goal line.\nConcerted pressure\nresulted in a push-over try\nby Steve Parker after earlier\nCaptain Rob Hargrove had\nbeen denied in a similar\neffort. The try was\nun converted but Imperial\nturned round at half time\nwith the knowledge that the\ngame was there for the\ntaking.\nGood tactical kicking\nfrom fly half Mike Anderson\nkept New College under\npressure and careless late\ntackles from a tiring New\nCollege defence gave\nFolland the opportunity to\nkick. 3 straight forward\npenalties. At 13-6 with ten\nminutes to go New College\nthrew the ball around in\ndesperate attempts to\ncounter attack and pull the\ngame back, however\nImperial's defence held\nform until the whistle went\nfor no side.\nThe final of the\nGutteridge Cup will be\nplayed on Sunday March\n2nd at Motspur Park.\nSupport for the club is\nalways welcome and\nspecial 'free' coaches will\nbe provided for people\nwishing to come along and\nexercise their larynx.\nEven if you do not\nunderstand all the rules.of\nthe game it is worth\ncoming along just to hear\nthe great combination of\naccents produced by the\nteam's back row!\n12 Friday 7 February FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Boring\nBut True\nAn Academic Affairs\ngeneral meeting of\nDepartmental Reps and\nAcademic Reps from all\ndepartments was held on\nWednesday. The meeting,\nthe first of its kind in recent\nyears, was described by\nICU Academic Affairs\nOfficer J Martin Taylor as\n'very successful'.\nThe meeting was\naddressed by Professor\nBlow of the Physics\nDepartment, who is\nchairman of the new\ncommittee responsible for\nreviewing teaching at the\nCollege, the Undergraduate\nStudies Committee (USC).\nHe spoke about the nature\nof university teaching and\nits relation to research, and\nthe events that led to his\ncommittee being formed\nand the work it is currently\ncarrying out. He then\ndiscussed points raised by\nstudents at the meeting.\nProfessor Blow revealed\nthat a chance remark by Sir\nPeter Swinnerton-Dyer,\nthen University Grants\nCommittee Chairman, that\nwhile IC is excellent at\nresearch, its teaching\nleaves something to be\ndesired, led to the\nformation of the\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee. Earlier in his\naddress, Professor Blow\nquoted the saying that\n'those who can, do; and\nthose who can't teach'. He\nthen went on to say that\nthis didn't apply at IC\nbecause no-one became a lecturer here unless they\nhad proven their ability to\n'do'. He noted that many\nstudents believe there is a conflict between research\nand teaching, and feel that\nthe latter suffers as a result.\nWhile he admitted that\nthere is a conflict of time\nbetween the two activities,\nhe refuted the idea that\nteaching is regarded as less\nimportant\u2014'no research is\nany use unless it can be\ncommunicated', he said. He\nthought that there is still an\nimpression amongst\nacademic staff that\nteaching is not important\nfor promotion, but the\nCollege is 'leaning over\nbackwards' to change this.\nLater the meeting split\ninto three discussion\ngroups designed to help\nstudent representatives\ndevelop the skills required\nto prepare a case and\npresent arguments to their\ndepartments. The three\ntopics used in the exercise\nwere: retaining an effective\ntutorial system, provision\nfor humanities options as\npart of degree courses, and\nSeptember res it exams.\nEach group prepared its\ncase, which they then\nargued out with a 'Head of\nDepartment' played by Carl\nBurgess. Finally, the\nUnion's new academic\naffairs policy was\ndiscussed.\nThe meeting lasted for\nthree hours and was\nattended by about forty\nstudent rep res nt at ives who\ncame from all departments.\nMr Taylor believes it will\nprovide an extra impetus to\nacademic affairs work at\ndepartmental level. He\nexpressed some\ndisappointment that more\nAcademic Reps didn't attend, but thought that all\nthose who did turn up had\nfound the meeting useful.\nHe added that it is intended\nthat the event should\nbecome an annual one,\nwith the next to be held in\nthe Autumn term.\nSmith Speaks\nDelia Smith visited More\nHouse last Sunday to give\na talk on prayer as part of\nContact Week. The well-known television\npersonality and practising\nCatholic stressed the need\nto study the Bible\ncontemplative ly and to set\naside quiet time for\npersonal prayer, although\nshe considered that the\nword 'prayer' is overused\nand off-putting.\nDelia Smith has written\ntwo books of meditation\nand reflection on Scripture:\n'A Feast for Lent' and 'A Feast for Advent'.\nParty\nRSMU had to move their\nPyjama Party from the\nHolland Club to the J CR at\nvery short notice on\nWednesday. Mines had\ninvited members of the\nAmerican Institute For\nForeign Study, but the\nHolland Club is only open\nto IC members. They also\nhad not obtained a licence.\nAlan Larsen, the J CR bar\nmanager, was unable to put\non a bar as he was\npreviously engaged.\nBeer and wine, bought\nfrom the Holland Club, was\nsold until 10pm after which\nit was provided free.\nSometime mechanical engineering student Giles Edward is\ninformed that he has failed to break the world land speed\nrecord during Guild's Motor Club's auto test on Sunday.\nClaim It\nThe Student Services\nOffice is encouraging\nstudents living in halls of\nresidence to claim housing\nbenefit, following a reorganisation of rent bills.\nInstead of indicating a single amount for total rent,\ninvoices will now show a seperate figure for rent and\nrates. This will mean that\nstudents are entitled to a larger rebate. Until now,\nfew students living in\nCollege ac como dati on have\nfiled claims because the\nbenefit payable was so low.\nAll students are advised to\nclaim, although residents of\nGarden Hall and the\nstudent houses may not be\nel lig i ble for benefit as their\nrent is too low.\nClaim forms are available\nfrom Lesley Gillingham in\nthe Student Services Office\nat 15 Princes Gardens.\nAsh\nImpressed\n370 staff and past and\npresent students attended\nCity and Guilds Dinner and\nDance on Friday. Speaking\nat the dinner, IC Rector\nProfessor Eric Ash said that\nhe was impressed by the\nhigh standards in all\ndepartments. He added,\nthough, that he was\nconcerned about the\nserious financial problems\nfaced by IC.\n4 Friday 7 February FELIX\n\n"

Of the 2140 votes\ncast in the referendum on\nMonday and Tuesday,\napproximately 60% were in\nfavour of affiliation.\nThe College wide ballot\nwas bought about by the\nmerger of Kings with\nChelsea and Queen Elizabeth Colleges. Prior to\nthe merger both Chelsea and\nQE C had been affiliated to\nthe NUS but Kings, by far\nthe largest of the Colleges, had not been affiliated. The merger has been phased in\ngradually, and students have\nbeen attending lectures on\ndifferent sites for two years.\nThe students' unions have\nremained separate until this\nacademic session, however.\nThe voting figures\nrepresent a turnout of\naround 35% of the 6100\nstudents at Kings( K QC).1978 of the voting papers\nwere valid of which1190 were in favour of affiliation\nand 788 were against.\nDuane Pass man, acting\nGeneral Secretary of K QC U and Education and Welfare\nOfficer for the Kensington site (formerly QE C), spoke to\nFELIX about the referendum\non Wednesday. He said he\nwas 'absolutely ex static' with\nthe result, and added that he\nconsidered it highly likely\nthat the vote had been in\nfavour at each campus, though there were no figures\nto confirm this. At the time\nof going to press, FELIX had\nbeen unable to contact either\nIan Markham or Michael Connolly, the Education and\nWelfare Officers for the\nStrand (Kings) and Chelsea sites of the College. A Wacky Raider\nStudents from University\nCollege inserted fake 'lucky\nwinner' vouchers into several\ncopies of FELIX after the\npaper had been distributed\nlast Friday. The vouchers\nproclaimed that the holder of\nthe copy had won five\npounds in the 'FELIX Grand\nDraw' and should collect\ntheir prize from the FELIX\nOffice. Around forty students\nbrought vouchers into the\noffice only to be\ndisappointed to learn that\nthe competition was a hoax.\nThe raid was organised by\nstudents who work on Pi, the\nNewspaper of UCL, in\nretaliation to comments made about Pi in the FELIX' Below The Belt' column on\nJanuary17. Their rate UCL students also put up posters\nar round the Union Building denouncing FELIX as\n'possibly the world's most\npretentious magazine' and claiming triumphantly that 'Pi\nstrikes again!'\nMembers of the FELIX staff\nattempted a counter-raid on\nMonday, the day on which Pi\nis regularly published. They arrived at the UCL Union Building before morning\nlectures began.\nUnfortunately there were no\ncopies of Pi to be found. It\nwas discovered that\nproduction problems had\ndelayed production of the\nnewspaper. The raid was\nrepeated on Tuesday morning, only to meet with a similar lack of success. FELIX received several\ntelephone calls from Pi staff\nmembers who claimed to\nrepresent London Student\nand were anxious to discover\nif FELIX was planning any\nreprisals against UCL. FELIX contacted the Pi Office on\nTuesday afternoon and were\ntold that publication of Pi\nwould probably be delayed\nuntil next Monday. There are\nno plans to get up at 7am for\na third time.\nHi-De-Hi\nSouthside\nManaging Surveyor (Residences)\nPeter Hallworth slams Southside\nsleep in.\nStudents woken by workmen\nat 8.15am would 'be glad of\nthe \"Alarm Call\" ' according\nto Managing Surveyor\n(Residences) Peter\nHallworth. In a letter to\nTizard Hall Chairman Steve\nNorton, Mr Hallworth\nexplained that in his view, as\nlectures start at 9.30am, students would want to be\nwoken up by 8.15a m.Mr Hallworth was replying\nto Mr Norton's criticism that\nthe work being carried out in\nSouthside had caused considerable disturbance\n(See FELIX31 January). Mr\nHallworth said that 'it is\ninevitable that some inconvenience is caused whenever building works are\nundertaken, especially when\nthe premises remain\noccupied during the period\nwhen the works are carried\nout. I am satisfied that\ndisturbances in Southside Building during the present\ncontract have been kept to a minimum'.\nMr Norton told FELIX that\nhe had been to see Mr Hallworth to discuss the\nletter. Mr Norton felt that\nsome of Mr Hallworth's views\nwere mistaken, and he tried\nto correct these. Mr Hallworth offered to organise\na meeting between himself,\nthe contractors, the\nhousekeeper and Mr Norton.\nFree! Friday 7 February No 730\n\n"

But the great\nimproviser Justin Brooking,\nwas at hand to remedy the\nsituation by jamming a plastic milk bottle in the\nhole.\nEventually the game got\nunder way with our three\nnovice ladies, Lorna\nStoodley, Jacky Knowles\nand Kate Hartley\nimprovising for all they\nwere worth and putting up\nquite a respectable show.\nThe captain again\nbecame a martyrs to the\ncause by giving up the\nchance to be on the\nwinning side by playing for\nthe opposition. The result\ndoes not do justice to\nRHBNC's commitment,\nskill, professionalism and\nsheer determination\nalthough we must\nacknowledge Justin's her ioc solo effort to score\nthe only goal.\nBecause of the treachery\nof the captain the rest of\nthe team conspired to leave\nhim in Egham but he got\nwise to this and managed\nto do a James Bond sy tle leap on to the roof rack\nalthough it was several\nmiles before he was let\nback into the bus, and only\non the condition that, as\nthe windscreen wipers were\nnot working, he got out\nevery half mile to work\nthem by hand. This worked\nwell until High Street Ken\nwhen the gallant driver\ntried to leave him behind\nand almost pushed him\nunder a bus (thanks Hugh).\nAfter changing his\ntrousers the capt then\nimprovised his way to a team pizza and general\nfestivities in the revamped\nNorfolk.\nThank you all for\nimprovising the team, I don't think you really\nappreciate how much I do\nfor you but I love you all\nreally.\nFencing\nAfter the incredibly narrow\ndefeats by Leeds in the\nUAU (14 lights to 13, and\nyet we scored more hits\nthan they did), it was good\nto see the team's morale\nreturned. Even without our\nnational squad member, IC\nwere fully in control with\nthe sabre, which at times\ntended to be fought more\nlike two handed\nbroadsword. UC have a strong foil team and we\ncouldn't hope to win easily,\nif at all. Even so, 7-2 was a poor result. The e pee too\nwas disappointing. The IC\nteam fought well but\nfrequently without the\naccuracy this weapon\ndemands.\nThe return match in a few weeks time should be a different story. ICFC will\nput forward a team with\neven more might and\npower then that which won\nthe U AU South Eastern\nregion two months ago.\nBy way of a post script,\nif anyone is interested in\nseeing some real fencing, I am going to watch some of\nthe Heron Paul Cup on\nSaturday 8th February. This\nis one of the premiere\nmews foil events held in\nthis country. It's free to go\nin and I 'll wait in the Union\nGym until 10-30am on Sat\nto show people the way\nand comment on the\naction.\nTen Pin Bowling\nIC 0 Southampton 0\nImperial College Bowling\nClub passed away last\nSaturday at the Tolworth\nBowl. It was a slow, painful\ndeath, brought about by\nterminal apathy, drawn out\nby the late arrival of\nSouthampton.

The\nclub quickly slipped from\nthe land of the living as the\nnext five games were lost.\nThe burial of the club\nwas tastefully handled by\nSouthampton and the\ncoffin bearers were the A team'sT Apostoli, E Ling\nand G Wong. The service\nwas too much for B Kwok\nwho left before its\ncompletion.\nThe club leaves a widow,\nM Morris, and a large\noverdraft.

The Rev\nJenkins said that many\npeople expected religion to\nprovide a simple answer to\ntheir problems.\nHe also felt that the\nability of humans to\ncomprehend the Universe\nwas evidence of God's existence. God, he said,\nwas part being and part\nconcept.\nWhen the meeting was\nopened to questions Guilds\nPresident Roger Preece\nasked the Rev Jenkins\nabout his opinions on the\nresurrection. He replied\nthat the resurrection was a spiritual resurrection. 'I'm not sure whether the\nstories about the empty\ntomb were started 10 or 15\nyears later' he said. He felt\nthat an empty tomb was\nnot proof of a physical\nresurrection and pointed\nout that the resurrection\nstories in the Gospels did\nnot agree.\nThe Bishop believed that\nthe accounts of the Virgin\nbirth were very similar to\nstories in myths and\nlegends. He explained that\nthe word 'virgin' was\nintroduced in the second\nand third century to supply\na neo platonic meaning.\nUnion Prospect\nFor Prospectus\nAn Alternative Prospectus\nmay be produced by the\nUnion this year, if the\nCollege agrees to provide\nextra funds for the\npublication.\nIt was decided last week\nthat the Union could not\nafford to produce an AP this year. The publication\nhas been produced\nannually for over ten years,\nbut the financial pressures\nwhen last year's Union\nestimates were being\nfinalized led to the AP\nbeing cut. Early this\nsession the Academic\nAffairs Committee\nexpressed its concern\nabout the lack of a new AP.\nOn Tuesday ICU\nAcademic Affairs Officer J Martin Taylor presented a paper to the College's Admissions Policy\nCommittee arguing that the\nAP, as the Union's contribution to recruitment,\nwas a valuable asset to the\nCollege which should be at\nleast partially funded\ndirectly by the College. The\npaper went on to say that,\neven if there are criticisms\nof some courses in it, the\nAP helps applicants to\nmake a positive decision in\nfavour of IC since they\nhave more unbiased\ninformation on which to\nbase their choice.\nThe Admissions Policy\nCommittee agreed to\nsupport Mr Taylor's request\nfor funds, and the matter\nwill now be raised with the\nRector, Professor Ash.\nWacky\nEstimate\nRSMU have submitted an\nestimate of \u00a317100 for next\nyear's budget, an increase\nof over 100%.\nICU Deputy President\nDave Kingston told FELIX\nthat the Mines estimate had\nnot included a figure for\nincome. Mines President\nDave Pearce had not seen\nthe estimate before it was\nsent to Mr Kingston by\nMines HJT Brian Sullivan.\nMr Pearce later agreed with\nMr Kingston that the claim\nwas too high. Earlier, Mr\nKingston had commented\nthat 'some of the estimates\nlooked like they've been\ncobbled together by a bunch of blok es who've sat\ndown in a bar and said\n\"let's see what we can\nscrew the Union for\" '.\nPanic\nRCS may be without a speaker for today's Annual\nDinner after comedian\nWillie Rushton withdrew\nearlier this week.

    "content": "illustrious RCS Broadsheet's Vicious\nRumours and Dirty Lies,\nthey mess it up.\nYours, wondering why ICU\nwastes its money on FELIX,\nTony Spencer\nMurray\nMisguided\nDear Sir,\nIt is interesting to note that\nthe 'author' of the 'article'\nmisguidedly filed under the\nArts (FELIX 31/1/86) should\nonly obscurely have\nprovided his name. A desire\nfor anonymity is usually\nassociated with such\nhysterical ravings;\npart icu a rly when it exhibits\nitself as the ignorant and\noffensive 'article'\nmasquerading as opinion,\nthat I assume was intended\nto contribute to a balanced\ndiscussion of sexism at\nImperial College.\nAn opinion whose\ncontent is more\nirreconcilable with its\nsection title can never have\nbeen written. The views\nespoused were so extreme\nand so inimical to art, that\nthey become almost an\n'anti-art' statement. Indeed,\nit is nearly suggested that\nany art form that\ncontravenes Mr Murray's sexist arbitration is a blemish that should be\neliminated-a sacrifice that\nwould seem to include\nmost artistic works, judging\nby the unbalanced nature\nof his opinions thereon.\nSuch sentiments could\nbe defensible were their\nfeebleness not\ncompounded by a crass\nignorance on the subject of\nart and a strange inability\nto distinguish between art\nand sexism. We are\nunaware of any Hemingway\nnovel written in the style\nparodied-a parody which\nreveals more about the\nauthor's unhealthy sexism\nobsession than Hemingway\nas an author. However, we\nare prepared to admit a hiatus in our knowledge\nnot having read everything\nHemingway published.\nEven so, if Hemingway had\nwritten anything in such a style, it is simply stupid,\nand liter ari ly indefensible,\nto make the implication\nthat this criticism extends\nto such books as 'For\nWhom the Bell Tolls' and\n'The Old Man and The Sea',\nto name but two.\nWe agree that the\noffensive innuendo in\nHeavy Metal Lyrics is\ndisturbingly sexist. But to\nequate Heavy Metal with\nCarmina Burana is naive at\nbest, while at worst it\nsuggest that we are dealing\nwith a Caliban whose\nvest i gal intellect has\ndeserted him. (As an aside,\nfor your enlightenment Mr\nMurray, Caliban is a character in Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'.

When I spoke to\nAnthony Hopkins as he was\nfilming The Good Father\nlor channel 4, he was\nexactly the gracious,\ncharming and articulate\nactor you might expect.\nVery polished, very\nprofessional. You could see\nthat he had done dozens of\ninter iv ews in the past and\nwould be doing dozens\nmore in the future, and yet\nrev\nig in the News. he was willing to humour\nme and to have a chat.\nWe talked about the\nUnited States where he has\nworked for the last ten\nyears. The two cities where\nhe had spent the most time\nin were New York and Los\nAngeles \u2014 both of which\nhe quite enjoyed despite\nthem being so different. Of\nNew York he said little\nmore than the classic one\nline 'I love NY', but he\ncheerfully described LA as\na 'Mickey Mouse town'\nwhere one had to 'know\nhow to play the game'. You\nmay have seen him last\nterm in the fun but awful\nHollywood Wives which Mr\nHopkins described as his\nattempt to prevent himself\nbeing seen as a 'respected\nBritish stage actor'. He\nignores the cultural snobs\nwho condemn him for that\nkind of work and said that\nthey simply have 'no sense\nof humour'.\nAlthough he has done a lot of excellent work, not all\nof it can be described as\ngood. He explained this by\nthe simple phrase, 'I love\nworking' \u2014 and I suppose\nthat is more important than\nanything. Whether he is\ndoing Hollywood Wives,\nThe Elephant Man, or\nPravda the point is that he\nis earning a living in the\ncareer he enjoys. Although\nhe obviously would prefer\nto appear in good\ntelevison/films/theatre, he\ndoesn't take himself too\nseriously and dislikes\npeople hassling him about\nhis work. Some directors\nhave, he said, too much of\na sense of their own\nimportance. In the end, it's only entertainment.\nIt is for this reason that\nhe enjoys doing\nprogrammes such as\nWogan. He admits honestly\n(unlike many other actors, I might add) that he loves\npublicity. By the very\nnature of the job, an actor\nhas decided he wants to be\nin the public eye. Those\nwho shy away from\npublicity he described as\neither 'silly' or 'hypocritical'.\nDeadline fever encourages taut,\ncrisp writing with a maximum of\nfacts and a minimum of frills ...\nFor a story about, say, an old lady\nwho was flushed with\nembarrassment as a result of\nbeing locked in a town hall\nlavatory, and the consequent\nchain reaction when the council\ntried to get to the bottom of it, at\nleast four hours should be\nallowed. For a late-night train\ncrash killing100 people, allow\ntwenty minutes.\nKeith Water hous i' In some ways it was quite\nbizarre chatting to Anthony\nHopkins. He seemed, for\nexample, very interested\nwhen I explained what\nImperial College was and\ntold me that he had always\nbeen very interested (but\nnever good) in Physics.\nThis one might not have\nexpected. But seeing him\non stage in the National\nTheatre's Pravda was a real\nshock. By the wonders of\nsuperb stage acting he\nmanaged to turn the\ncharming and intelligent Mr\nHopkins into the slightly\nmad genius and Afrikaaner,\nLambert Le Roux.\nPravda is a Fleet Street\ncomedy written by David\nHare (Plenty) and Howard\nBrenton [The Romans in\nBritain). The plot centres\naround the struggle\nbetween Andrew May (Tim\nMclnnery) and Le Roux.\nKate Buffery, May's wife,\nrepresents the forces of\ngood while Le Roux\nrepresents the force of evil.\nAlmost all the characters,\nexcept Rebecca May and\nMay's best friend are\nchara cat ure s( with\nridiculous names to match)\nwhereas May himself\nchanges from a person to a cartoon and back again as\nthe battle takes hold.\nAnthony Hopkins and Bill\nNighy (who plays Le\nRoux's Australian sidekick,\nEaton Sylvester) both use\nbody language to convey\nmuch of their respective\ncharacters.\nBy the clever use of the\nappropriate walks and\nstances, the cartoons come\nalive and beautifully\ntheatrical. At the climax of\nthe play the stance that had\nbeen the trademark of Le\nRoux throughout the play\nis taken to such lengths\nthat he turns into a snake\nbefore our eyes (perhaps\nsymbolic of the snake who\ntempted Adam and Eve?)\nVery well done indeed.\nThis show, which has\nalready won much\ndeserved critical acclaim\n(and, indeed, awards) is\nstunning. The acting is a joy, and the play itself is\ntight and well written.\nAnthony Hopkins has\nhimself won awards for his\nportrayal of Lambert Le\nRoux. He may have gone to\nthe States for ten years to\nget away from the\n'respected British stage\nactor' label, but whether he\nlikes it or not, he's got it\nback...with interest.\n8 Friday 7 February FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "pico con4 What's It all About?\nAs an ardent SF fan, people\nfrequently ask me certain\nquestions (well maybe not, but\nit's one way to start an article).\nThe most common of these\ngoes along the lines of 'Why\ndo you like reading all that\njuvenile stuff about Bug Eyed\nGreen Monsters and silly ray\nguns?' I usually have two\nanswers for this question. One\nis very short, consisting of two\nwords, one of which is 'off.\nSince this reply would not\nimprove our image among the\nesteemed readers of this\npublication I shall now resort\nto my second, longer answer.\nSF (not sci-fi, an abr evi ation all time fans loathe) as we\nknow it today has its roots in\ntwo very different places. The\none most people think of is\nthe 'pulp' American magazine\nof the thirties and forties,\nfamous for what many people\nnow associate with Science\nfiction - bug eyed monsters,\nray guns, phallic spaceships\nand all that. Indeed it is the\nghost of the pulps that still\nhaunts us. The other form of\nproto-SF is the much more\nrespectable 'Science\nRomances' of HG Wells, Olaf\nStapledon and other\nEnglishmen of the period\nbetween the World Wars. Their\ntales were far more\nintellectually stimulating and\nof much greater literary ability.\nThey dealt with real questions\nof political, philosophical or\nhuman interest. Wells' The\nTime Machine or Stapleton's Last and First Men are prime\nexamples. Indeed the latter is\nstill regarded by many as\nbeing both the finest SF ever\nwritten and the best piece of\nliterature to come out of\nEngland between the wars.\nFELIX\nWhat became of these\nEnglish bastions of SF\nliterature? Well, they died. For\nmany years all the SF that\nremained was in the style of\nAmerican pulp. At this point,\nin the 40's and 50's Hollywood\ngot hold of pulp ish SF and\nfilmed it, producing what most\npeople think of as the\narche typical SF film \u2014\ndistinctive features being bad\nstory, cheap effects, lack of\ncharacterization, totally\nunorganised etc. etc.\nHowever, while Hollywood\nwas butchering SF's public\nimage, the writers were getting\ntheir act together and\nproducing some decent stuff.\nIn the US such authors as\nSilverberg, Pohl, Sheckley and\nLeiber started to drag SF up\nfrom the sorry state it was in.\nThen in the 60's, England the\nso called New Wave authors,\nlike Moorcock, Aldiss and\nBallard started producing\nwork which was as good or\nbetter than contemporary\nliterature. JG Ballard last year\nnearly won the Booker Prize,\nand Mike Moorcock has been\npraised so highly by modern\ncritics that you'd think he was\nthe greatest living writer.\nSome people might agree.\nSince then the ghetto walls\nsurrounding SF have\ncontinued to fall, and it is no\nlonger a separate and\n'worthless' art form. It's a pity\nthe film makers and TV\nproducers still think they live\nin the so called Golden Age of\nSF, when EE 'Doc' Smith\nspaces ships ruled the\nsubspace lanes and Q beams\nfried the vile slimy aliens, the\ndays when men were men and\nwomen did what they were\ntold.\nThese days are over, and SF\nis set to conquer the literary\nuniverse!\nFriday 7\nThe other question I'm frequently asked this time of\nyear, (and this one isn't just a way of getting an article\ngoing) is 'what's happening at\nPICOCON?' For those of you\nwho don't know, PICO CON is\nSF SOC's own mini-convention. This is a gathering\nof people interested in SF\n(though that's not obligatory)\nto see SF Films, hear speakers\n(authors or generally\ninteresting people) and play\ncompetitions of a generally SF\nnature. One thing we're doing\nthis year, which we are\nespecially pleased about, is\nshowing videos of old TV\nprogrammes. SF on televisions\nis occasionally very well done,\nand almost always disappears\nonce you've seen it, never to\nreturn again. Also, since many\npeople were first introduced to\nScience Fiction by television,\nthey have pleasant memories\nof TV programs from their\nyouth. At PICO CON and a secret event planned later this\nterm, you'll get to see some of\nyour favourite TV Science\nFiction. So, without further\nado, here is the PICO CON timetable. Oh and another\nthing, PICO CON4 is on all\nday Saturday 15th Feb in the\nUnion Dining Hall and S CR. It\nstarts at 10am and continues\nfor at least 12 hours at the\nbargain price of \u00a32.50. Here is\nthe programme of events,\nhope to see you there.\nFebruary\nPicocon Timetable\n10.00am Registration\n10.15am The Twilight Zone film\nEpisodic film based on the famous\n60's TV serial with sequences\ndirected by Spielberg, Landis, Miller\nand Lucas.\n12.00pm1 st Round of Quiz game against\nCambridge University SFSOC\n12.45pm Lunch\n1.30pm UFO episode.
