    "content": "Summer News Update\nCollege Gambles on New Hall\nThe College has purchased a new\nstudent residence in Earl's Court to\nhouse about 40 students. The\nCollege Secretary, John Smith\nexchanged contracts for the former\nGirl Guides Hostel, Olave House on\n2 September. The rental for the new\nresidence will be set at \u00a3 5 5 per\nweek. Although this figure will not\nbe suf fi ent to pay off the interest on\nthe loan taken out for the property,\nthe College are gambling that\naccumulated interest will be offset\nby the rise in value of the property.\nMr Smith hopes that part of the\n\u00a31.6 million cost of the purchase will\nbe met by the Sherfield Trust, with\nthe balance of around \u00a31.3 million\nto be financed by a loan. The\nSherfield Trust is legally\nindependent of the College and is\nadministered by a group of trustees,\nmostly made up of the College's governors. Mr Smith is the\nSecretary of the Trust.\nThe \u00a31.6 million bid was referred\nto the Charities Commission a month ago since the Girl Guides\nAssociation is a registered charity,\nand was returned last week. The\npurchase has been described as 'a gamble' by Mr Smith and Senior\nAssistant Finance Officer, Malcolm\nAldridge.\nMr Smith told FELLX that students\nliving in the new house would have\nto pay \u00a3100 per week to cover the\nloan interest and this was not\nfeasible. Mr Smith hopes to reduce\nthe loan by securing funds from\nother trusts. Mr Aldridge told FELIX\nthat if this fails the loan capital will\ncontinue to increase at a hopefully\nlower rate than the property value\nrise. The \u00a31.6 million bid for the\nproperty was tendered when\ninterest rates were lower than at\npresent and property values in\ncentral London were rising at a higher rate.\nMr Smith stressed that the cost of\nthe purchase would not be\ntransferred to students outside\nOlave House, in line with the\nCollege's agreement with former\nICU President, Christine Taig. The\nCollege agreed not to transfer the\ncost of any further purchases to the\noverall students residence account\nafter the purchase of Fisher Hall.\nThe new house is made up of two\nVictorian houses with three floors,\naccommodating around 40 students.\nMr Smith told FELIX that the\nproperty was ideally suited to the\nCollege's needs since it has been\nused as a hostel and offers\nimmediate occupation, although\nsome work will be required in the\nkitchen areas. The work will take a month or so, during which students\nwill be given meal vouchers for use\nin the College refectories. He went\non to say that he had discarded\nseveral other properties, which were\nnot suitable for immediate use. He\nsaid 'People are always accusing me\nof not taking risks, and now I'm taking one'. He hopes that the\nfinancial situation for the new\npurchases 'should look reasonable'\nafter three to five years.\nHamlet Gardens Trashed\nThree groups of squatters w evicted last Friday from the student\nresidences in Hamlet Gardens\nfollowing a court injunction. The\nsquatters have caused several\nthousand pounds worth of damage\nand have been threatening the\nHamlet Gardens staff with violence.\nSome of the squatters have since\nbroken into another Hamlet\nGardens flat owned by the Notting\nHill Housing Trust.\nThe squatters have been living in\nflats 131, 137 and 135 since they\nwere vacated at the end of last term.\nThe occupants of one of the flats had\nbeen living in the College's200 block since Christmas until they\nwere evicted by builders working for\nthe landlords, Strolmor at the end\nof term.\nThe squatters have been regularly\nhurling abuse at the student\nmanagers in Hamlet's Summer\nLetting Scheme. One of the\nmanagers, Steve Mercer, told FELIX\nthat the squatters had hit him in the\nribs with a snooker cue and said that\none of the squatters had threatened\nto set a vicious dog onto the staff.\nSeveral residents have also been\nthreatened including an old lady\nwho is now too frightened to talk to\nthe police. The managers also\nbelieve that the squatters are\nresponsible for a burglary in one of\nthe flats on July 18th in which Hi Fi\nand jewelry were stolen.\nAccommodation officer, Loretto\nO 'Callaghan told FELIX that the\nsquatters had left the flats in a disgusting state. One of the flats\nwas covered in abusive graffiti\ndirected at the student managers.\nContract cleaners refused to clean\nanother flat where the squatters\nkept a dog and eleven puppies\nlocked inside. The furniture inside\nanother flat had been thrown out of\nthe windows.\nSummer Letting Scheme finishes.\nMrs O 'Callaghan is considering\nplans to give students a weeks free\naccommodation in an attempt to\nensure that the flats are not left\nempty.\nMrs O 'Callaghan is critical of the\nlack of support given to her by the\npolice. \"Hammersmith Police\nStation is very unhelpful and didn't want to get involved\" she said. She\nis currently negotiating with the\nCollege to persuade them to take the\nsquatters to court for assault. She\nhas asked College to help with the\ncosts, should the student managers\ndecide to prosecute.\nCollege Security Chief, Geoff\nReeves told FELIX that the College\nhad no plans to hire security guards\nto police Hamlet when the flats are\nvacated at the end of Summer. He\nsaid that the flats were too dispersed\nto police effectively and added that\nsecurity firms would be unwilling to\ndeal with the squatters, who he\ndescribed as 'psychopaths'. He\nwent on to say that the only legal\nway of removing squatters was to\napply for a court in ju ct ion,a process\nwhich can take months.\nMr Reeves is planning to write to\nthe Commissioner of Police, the\nSecretary of State for the\nEnvironment and the Home\nSecretary in an attempt to prevent\nthe problem recurring. \"We need to\nget the law clarified with respect to\nour property\" said Mr Reeves.\nHOMELESS?\nUNION CRASH PAD\nFri 30th Sept-Mon 10th Oct\n(excluding the nights of 314 and 7/8 Od)\nThe Green Committee Room and\nBrown Committee Room (women\nonly) will be available as a crash\npad between 11pm and 9am. Bedding will not be provided\u2014\nI bring sleeping bag etc.\nPage 10 FELIX October 3 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nA Strange New World Let me take this,\nopportunity to welcome you to Imperial College,.\nor, if you're an old hand, to welcome you back.\nIf your new to the College and are feeling a bit\napprehensive, don't worry - you are not alone.\nMake the most of Frehers Week; go to all the\nevents and sign up for all the clubs which interest\nyou. There will be plenty of time to worry about\nlectures in the forthcoming weeks.\nThe Union The ground floor of the Union\nBuilding has been completely refurbished over\nthe Summer. The Union bar has been given a much needed re decoration and a new stage and\nlighting tower have been constructed in the\nUnion Lounge.\nThe Union refectory has undergone a major\nfacelift and a catering consultant has been\nbrought in to design new menus. The emphasis\nwill be on 'healthy eating' and I urge you to give\nit a try - eating burgers every day is very bad\nfor the complexion.\nGet involved in the Union. It is your Union and\nit is here to represent you. The worst thing you\ncan do is spend three years doing nothing but\nwork - all you get at the end is a piece of paper\nwith a grade written on it.\nSTA The College's Assistant Finance Officer,\nMalcolm Aldridge acted irresponsibly when he\nhalted work on STA's new premises. (STA are\nthe College's on-site travel agents). It seems that\nMr Aldridge told everyone about his dissatisfaction with the contract drawn up by the\nUnion and STA, except the Union. Instead, he\nwaited for the builders to start work before telling\nthe Union that the contract could no go ahead,\nat great embarrassment to the Union.\nMr Aldridge was quite right to query the clause\nin the contract which called for the College to pay\ncompensation should ST A be removed from\nCollege premises. Why should the College be\nexpected to risk having to pay compensation\nwhen it is the Union that will be making money\non the deal?\nBut for him to claim that he was unable to\ncontact the Union Manager, Dave Peacock to tell\nhim of his concerns over the deal is absurd. If Mr Aldridge was unable to contact Mr Peacock by\nphone (Mr Peacock carries a portable phone with\nhim wherever he goes) he should have sent him a letter, or left a message for him in the Union\nOffice. Oddly enough, he did manage to send\nthe manager of ST A a letter explaining the\nsituation.\nSo what is Mr Aldridge up to ? Whatever it is,\nI think we can be sure, from the lack of regard\nhe has shown towards the Union, that it will not\nbe to the students' advantage. I could hazzard\na guess and suggest that the College are trying\nto secure a deal with STA for themselves...but\nthen again I could be completely wrong.\nAlternative Prospectus Supplement Martyn\nPeck's Alternative Prospectus Supplement\ncaused a great rumpus amongst the academics\nwithin College. They complained - rightly - that\nthe supplement represented their departments\nunfairly and inaccurately. Deputy President Chas\nBrereton and former president Sydney Harbour\nBridge (name changed in aid of comic relief)\ntherefore deserve all credit for rewriting the\nsupplement.\nThe new AP represents the departments both\na curate ly and fairly. In so doing it looks set to\ncause an even greater rumpus than the first\nversion.\nStory 1. At the start of the Summer, the Union\nOffice asked FELIX to print the AP supplement\nfor them. They explained that the supplement\nwas required urgently and so ex-FELIX editor\nJudith Hackney and I volunteered to do the\nartwork and the printing, so that it could be ready\nwithin a week. The Union even agreed to fork\nout an extra \u00a350 to print the covers on coloured\npaper rather than wait a couple of days for a paper delivery.\nWhy then, one wonders, are the supplements\nstill sitting here in the FELIX office ?\nStory 2. One of the Union Officers asked FELIX\nto typeset the welfare booklet 'But were afraid to\nask..' so that the book could be printed and\ndistributed to this year's Freshers. Rose Atkins,\nour typesetter operator wasted a whole week\nsetting the booklet (and typesetting paper is not\ncheap) only to be informed by the Officer in\nquestion that he didn't have time to make the\nrequired corrections. Instead, the Union decided\nto distribute the University of London Union\nWelfare book to the fresher s. Story 3.runs something like this: The Union\ncommissioned the Dramatic Society to repaint the\nUnion Lounge. They payed a few members of\nDramsoc over \u00a31000 for doing so. Last year, the\nEnts Crew repainted the Lounge free of\ncharge...and it is rumoured that the company\ncontracted to refurbish the Union Refectory could\nhave done the job for half the price. (I hope this\nstory4 s n't true.)\nThe blas e attitude of some of the Union\nOfficers, when it comes to spending money is a cause for concern. Every time \u00a350 is wasted by\nthe Union it is \u00a350 which could be well spent on\na club or a society. I hope these incidents do not\nreflect the trend for the coming year.\nFreshers' UGM One of the motions due to be\ndebated at the fresher s'U GM purports to ban the\ndiscussion of 'political motions' at UG M's. The\nmotion, proposed by the previous Union\nPresident and seconded by the current President\nis ill conceived.\nEssentially it prohibits UG M's from discussing\nmotions which are not 'directly relevant to the\nacademic or personal welfare of students at IC In other words issues such as Human Rights,\nreligion, the arms race, racism.. .the list goes on...\nwill be banned from UG M's. Whatever happened to freedom of speech? The\nUnion would be amongst the first to condemn\nthe no platform policy of Left Wing Student\nUnions; this motion is no better than the no\nplatform policy. It is a good deal worse. The\nmotion states that the Union should not fund any\ncampaigns which do not directly involve British\nstudents. In other words, events such as the\nHuman Rights Week - which IC has successful y staged in the past - will be a thing of the past.\nI need not remind those students who attended\nlast years UG Ms that amongst the only quo rate U GM of the year was the 'political' debate on\nBethlehem University. Students at IC are far too removed from the real\nworld already. Why blinker them even more by\nbanning discussion on important human issues?\nThat the motion should originate from an ex\nPresident who portrayed himself as 'the student\nactivist' during his election campaign is hypocrisy\nindeed. I urge you to attend Thursday'sU GM and vote to consign this motion where it\nbelongs..in the dust bin.\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School. Imperial\nCollege merged with St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool in August. The College has now gained\nthe official title of Imperial College of Science,\nTechnology and Medicine. The merger seems to\nhave changed very little so far, but a ceremony\nis planned on the 19 October to mark the\noccasion. (FELIX is still awaiting its invitation.)\nIC Union is currently engaged in negotiations\nwith the Students Union at St Mary's. Inspite of\nthe College's merger, the Unions are still far from\nready to merge.\nThe students at Mary's are naturally worried\nby the prospect that they will be swamped by\nImperial. There are two factors which should\nreassure them. Firstly IC is based on a Constituent College system which still allows its\nConstituent Colleges to retain their\nindependence. Secondly St Mary's is in Paddington and would be hard pressed to lose\nits individuality even if it wanted to.\nThe clich ed Medical Student is in many ways\nsimilar to our own clich ed Mining Student. They\nlike drinking, they are in ten sly proud of their own\ninstitution, they play rugby and they are on first\nname terms with their lecturers. They have to\nwork as hard (maybe harder) as students at IC;\nthey have no politically active clubs and in fact\npolitically active medical students are frowned\nupon by the medical establishment.\nWhen it comes down to it, IC Union has little\nto gain from merging with St Mary's Union. With\nthe exception of a mountain hut (which they are\nguarding jealously from IC students) they have\nno facilities which are not duplicated in the rest\nof IC. Nor, with only 200 pre clinical students in\nresidence can they be expected to make any\ncontribution to the male:female ratio at IC.\nSt Mary's have much more to gain by\nmerging..access to IC's clubs and MONEY. And\nthis is the dilemma which taunts them. At heart\nSt Mary's Union does not want to merge, it wants\nto retain its own identity; it wants to keep its own facilities for its own students. Yet the Union keeps\none eye on the possibility of extra funding for its\nclubs and societies.\nFELIX Are you interested in joining the FELIX\nteam? Drop in and see us in the ' Good Time\nFreedom Bus' at Fresher's Fair. We will be\nrunning introductory sessions for the first few\nWednesdays of term, or come to the FELIX\ncheese and wine party on Friday in the FELIX\noffice at 8.00pm. We need writers, reporters,\nartists, photographers, advertising salespeople,\nreviewers....\nStaff Meeting Today at 1.00pm.

    "content": "Summer News Update\nRector's Computer\nStolen\nAn IBM Computer system, valued\nat \u00a36000 was stolen from the\nRector's Electrical Engineering office\non July 15th. The incident is just one\nin a series of thefts which have cost\nthe College insurers an estimated\n\u00a3130,000.\nAmongst the computers stolen\nwas an IBM Landmark computer\nvalued at \u00a342,000, one of only three\nin the world, which was taken from\nthe Royal School of Mines in April.\nThe spate of thefts began at the\nstart of the year when a BBC\nmicrocomputer was stolen from\nICU's Microcomputer Club in the\nUnion Building. Since then 29\ncomputers have been taken from\ndepartments within College.\nThe thefts are believed to be the\nwork of ex-members of College,\nwho may be equip ed with low level\nCollege master keys.\nSecurity Officer Terry Briley told\nFELIX that many of the thefts were\nmade possible by people leaving\ntheir offices unlocked. He added\nthat thieves were able to by pass the\nsecurity-desks by using back exits\nleft open by members of staff on\ntheir way home.\nInspite of se veal sightings, the\nthieves have eluded College security\nofficers.\nTwo men, described as Asian, one\n5ft6 and stocky and the other 5ft9 and thin with spike y hair were seen\nattempting to steel a computer in the\nElectrical Engineering Department\nin August, whilst in September, a dark skinned man and a thin\nfemale, were challenged by guards\nin the Royal School of Mines on\nSeptember 7. The couple escaped,\nleaving behind a computer stolen\nfrom the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment. Several other sightings\nhave been reported.\nThe College had arranged for a small squad of police officers to\npatrol the College for two weeks\nduring the Summer. The plan met\nwith little success when the squad\nwas called away for three nights out\nof four. Mr Briley hopes to be able\nto arrange further police surveillance\nin the future.\nMr Hyndes of the Computing\nCentre has been given the task of\nensuring that the College's remaining computers are better\nprotected. He told FELIX that the\ndoor connecting the Royal School of\nMines with the Mechanical\nEngineering Department would be\nlocked and that magnetic locks\nwould be fitted to the fire doors\nwithin College. Departments will be\nexpected to pay for the locks which\nare of a type which release in the\nevent of fire and cost \u00a31000 to \u00a32000.\nGeology Slams UGC\nReview\nFollowing their review of Earth\nSciences, the University Grants\nCommittee have instructed\nImperial's Geology department to\nreduce its quota of staff and\nstudents. The department has been\ntold to lose 10 academic staff and 13\nnon\u2014academic staff and to reduce\nits annual undergraduate intake\nfrom 45 to 32. As part of the UGC's requirements, the department has\nbeen 'reorganised' into teaching and\nresearch divisions. The UGC's decision has come under heavy fire\nfrom academics within Geology.\nThe academics are critical of the\n;UGC's alleged use of the Science\nCitation Index as a means of\nassessing the quantity of research\ncarried out at Imperial. They argue\nthat the index does not take into\naccount many of the journals which\npublish the work from applied\nGeology Departments such as\nImperial. They also point out that\nmuch of the work carried out by the\ndepartment is for industry and\nhence is not available for open\npublication.\nHead of the Geology Department,\nDr Richard Selley told FELIX that\nthe department was amongst the\ntop two or three in the country in\nevery criterion assessed by the UGC\nCommittee. 'We were told by a member of the UGC Committee that\nwe were subjectively assessed,' he\nsaid. He is critical of the fact that the\nChairman of the regional Earth\nSciences Committee spent only two\nhours at the College before the\nassessment was made. This is in\nsharp contrast to the current UGC review of Petroleum Engineering\nduring which the whole committee\nvisited the department for two days.\n\"The reviewers were basically\npure academic Geologists and were\nreluctant to accept Imperial\nCollege's international status,' he\nsaid.\nFELIX spoke to Professor Mc\nConnell, regional chairman of the\nEarth Sciences Review Committee.\nProfessor McConnell told FELIX that\nthe UGC's decision was based\nprimarily on a 'bid' made by the\ndepartment outlining their plans for\nthe next ten to fifteen years. 'The\nUGC made a complete analysis of\nthe figures but they weren't specifically used,' he said.\nThe bid was made by the\ndepartment as part of a detailed\ndossier which the Geology\nDepartment submitted to the UGC at the beginning of the year. The\nUGC were unhappy with the bid\nand asked for it to be resubmitted\ntwice. The first draft of the bid called\nfor moderate increases in staff and\nstudent numbers and equipment.\nThe revised version outlined the\nplanned 'restructuring' of the\ndepartment into teaching and\nresearch sections.\nAccording to the Department, the\nUGC declined to say why they were\nunhappy with the bid.' 'We didn't know what we were were bidding\nfor,' said Dr Selley.\nThe Rector Professor Eric Ash,\ntold FELIX that the cutbacks would\nbe softened by support from\nindustry. Following a press\nconference given by the Rector in\nJune, industry has sponsored two\nlectureship s and ii is hoped that\nmore will be forthcoming\nStudent\nUnions\nAlarmed by\nDES\nSurvey\nStudent Unions are alarmed by a nationwide survey designed to\nassess the services provided by the\nNational Union of Students (NUS).\nThe survey, launched by the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience (DES), asks for detailed\nbreakdowns of union finances, and\nvoting procedures and asks Unions\nto assess the services provided by\nthe NUS in financial terms.\nThe twenty-one page\nquestionnaire has been circulated to\nthe Vice-Chancellors, Directors and\nPrincipals in seventy universities,\npolytechnics and colleges of further\neducation. Brunei, Heriot-Watt,\nBristol, Loughborough and\nNewcastle Universities are amongst\nthose on the list.

Mr Baker said the\nGovernment recognised that 'many\nindividual students do not wish to\nbe represented by the National\nUnion of Students.' He added that\ntaxpayers' money should be used to\nprovide services for students and\nnot for political campaigning.\nThe content of survey bears a number of similarities to an Early\nDay Motion on the 'National Union\nof Students closed shop' put\nforward by Timothy Janman MP, in\nDecember. The EDM, an un debated statement of support for an issue,\ncalled for the Secretary of State for\nEducation and Science to take action\nover the a nomo ly which allows the\nNUS to run a 'closed shop'. This,\nit is claimed, is not within the spirit\nof the 1987 Employment Act which\naimed to 'significantly reverse\nclosed shop arrangements.'\nMore recently, Mr Janman\nproposed an amendment to the\nGovernment Education Reform Bill.\nThe amendment has been described\nby the NUS as an attempt to outlaw\nunion affiliation with organisations\nwhich do not provide goods or\nservices.\nOctober 3 1988 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nA feature on recycling paper, by Richard Heap\nPaper Money\nWhen it comes to recycling waste\npaper, Britain ranks fourth in the\nworld. Fifty five percent of its paper\nand paper products are recycled and\nonly countries like the U.S.A., Spain and West Germany, do\nbetter. Britain exports about three\nthousand tonnes of waste paper\nevery year\u2014and the country is\nunique in owning the only mill\ncapable of converting 100% waste\nnewsprint back into newsprint.\nFew people realise how much\npaper this country uses; estimates\nplace the figure at 8 million tonnes\neach year. This includes many forms\nof packaging, cardboard, cigarette\npackets, hygiene papers and tissues,\novercoming the problems of\njamming in the machine, and\nputting dust in the toner. Yet no one\nseems to want to risk trying recycled\npaper in their machines especially\nas the photocopier merchants tend\nnot to recommend them.\nThere is a reluctance to use some\nof the lower grade recycled paper,\nsuch as toilet paper. This is not only\nbecause recycled toilet paper sounds\na bit suspect, but according to\nHealth and Safety regulations,\npublic toilets should offer the\nhighest standards\u2014surely they are\nnot still remembering the\nsandpaper-like recycled toilet paper\nthat was handed out during the\nor cheaper, than 'virgin' paper, and\nso it should be. Producing recycled\npaper uses 50% less energy than\nthermal process. The chemical\nprocess destroys the material in the\nwood which holds the fibres\nRecycled paper enlarged 100 times under an electron microscope.\nWaste paper delivered for recycling\nenvelopes, and writing paper. Most\nof these can be, and are, made with\nrecycled fibres. Despite recycling so\nmuch of our waste, 57% of our\npaper comes from abroad, either as\nraw pulp or as finished products.\nVery few of these finished products\nare made from recycled fibres.\nIn spite of improvements in the\nquality of recycled paper, people are\nreluctant to use it. For office use,\nrecycled paper has often been\nconsidered undesirable because of\nits colour and quality. But things\nhave changed; with improvements\nbeing made all the time, the better\nrecycled paper is now as good as\ncomparable 'virgin' non-recycled\npaper.\nConservation Laid, one of the best\nrecycled papers is inexpensive and\ncannot be distinguished from\nConqueror except by its water-mark,\nwhich bears the recycling logo.\nAnyone who has used Conqueror\nwill know that it is a very high\nquality and expensive paper. Photo\ncopier paper too, has improved,\n'Great' Wars?\nRecycled paper is now as cheap,\npulping trees and there is an\nenvironmental saving\u2014less toxic\neffluent is produced by the process.\nThe basic rule for recycling waste\npaper is, \"the more you put on the\npaper, the more effort required to\nremove it, so the lower the grade\".\nWaste paper merchants deal in 66\ngrades of paper, although these can\nbe grouped into about 8 broad\ncategories. In a University the most\ncommon categories are newsprint,\nmagazines and other free\nadvertising publications, and\ncardboard, which are all low grade,\nand photocopier paper, general\noffice white paper and computer\npaper.\nMost paper is made of wood\nfibres, which are arranged randomly\nin the paper. The fibres are pulped\neither mechanically or by ache mo THE C The best grade is clean white paper or 'Best White'. This is un printed and un coated and can b \u00ab pulped with very little extra processing\nnot produce much. This can be reprocessed into high quality writing,\nsuch as C \u00ab n Laid.\nComputer paper is a high grade paper consistent in qu ali' y. lightly\nprinted, and rarely un coated. It occasionally con ies in a woody form\nwhich is a low grade paper, fetching only a quarter of the price of\nnon-woody. This too can go into good grade paper, or B ven back\ninto computer paper.\nThe next grade is called White Heavy Letter , which covers most\nwhite .ide ranges\nfrom lightly printed letters to heavily printed photocopies. Again,\nits value varies according to the density of the print. In general, white\nheavy letter is n high grade paper which can be reprocessed into\nphotocopier and duplicating paper.\nMagazines are printed on the lowest paper grade. They are often\nheavily coated, so they feel nice, but this hides the low quality paper\nunderneath. Recyled magazine paper is not very useful except in\nproducing packaging and hy gein e papers, such as hand towels.\nIncluded in the same grade are coloured office wastes, which\ncontain dyed paper. The only way to hide the dye colour, is to over\ndye it - lu r.>... \u2022 ..\ntogether, producing a higher quality\npaper which does not yellow in the\nsun, as the mechanically produced\npaper does. The mechanical process\nseperate s the fibres by grinding up\nthe wood, which produces only a low grade paper, often referred to\nas 'woody'.\nOnce the paper has been rolled,\nit may undergo various processes to\nimprove the quality or suit a certain\napplication. The paper may be\nwater-proofed for posters, or plastic\ncoated for book covers. The most\ncommon coating is kaolin which is\nrolled into the fibres, making the\nsurface smooth. Low grade fibres\nare often improved by this method.\nWhen paper is recycled, ink has\nto be removed and any coatings\nwhich may have been applied,\ndepending on the final use of the\nfibres. Each process requires extra\neffort. It also loosens some of the\nfibres, so less volume of paper is\nproduced at the end. Amongst the\nmost difficult coatings to remove are\nthe self-carbonating layers. High\ngrade waste paper commands a good price since reprocessing to\nclean fibres requires little effort, and\nwastage is low.\nThe grade of paper is dependent\n! on the colour of the paper and the\namount of print. Coloured paper is\nvirtually worthless, since the dyes\nused in the paper tend to be water-proof and therefore difficult to\nremove. Likewise water-proof print,\nalthough not used very often,\ncannot be removed except by\nexpensive processing. Normal print\nis easier to remove, but the heavier\nthe print the more processing\nrequired, which effectively lowers\nthe grade.\nThe grade can be ruined by\nleaving paper clips, bulldog clips, or\nOct ber 3 1988 FELIX 'Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "Union\nDeputy President\nChas Brereton\nHello, my name is Charles\nBrereton and I am the Union Deputy\nPresident. This article is intended to\nbring people up to date with what's been happening in the Union\nBuilding over the Summer and also\nto explain some of the things you\nwill need to know, especially if you\nare a Fresher.\nUnion Building Refurbishment\nThis is by far the most important\ndevelopment over the Summer. The\nSnack Bar, Union Bar, Ents Lounge\nand Video Games room have all\nbeen refurbished, and I hope that as\nmany of you as possible will use the\nimproved facilities that we have to\noffer. The Snack Bar itself will be\nserving food which has a healthy\nbias, yet is app et ising. The Union\nBar has had the traditional oak-panne ling completely refinished,\nand new lighting and furniture\ninstalled. The Ents lounge has had\na new lighting tower and stage\nconstructed, and a permanent\nlighting rig has been installed for\ndiscos and bands.\nUnion Cards\nA Union card is your identification\nwithin College; you should carry it\nat all times. You will need your\nregistration slip (available in the\nJunior Common Room) and two\npassport-size photos. We have a photo machine in the Union\nBuilding foyer where these can be\nobtained. On the reverse of the card\nare useful telephone numbers which\nyou can use in case of emergency.\nThe card folds in half so you can slip\nit into your wallet.\nUnion cards are available in the\nUnion Dining Hall throughout\nFreshers' Week.\nRape Alarms\nAll women students can obtain a rape alarm free of charge from the\nUnion office on production of a valid\nregistration slip or Union card. The\nalarm emits a loud screeching noise\nwhen activated. Please note that\n\"Mace\" sprays (available on the\ncontinent) are illegal in this country.\nAcademic Affairs\nOverseas Students\nIf you have any academic\nquestions or worries, or if you are\nan overseas student with a problem,\nthen feel free to drop in to the Union\nOffice and I 'll try to help you as best\nI can. The areas in question are\nthose which I will be representing\nyou to College, so if there is a matter\nwhich you think is important, please\nlet me know. You can also contact\nthe relevant officers: Richard\nSpencer (Academic Affairs Officer),\nMech Eng 3 and Amin El-Kholy\n(Overseas Students Committee\nChairman), Computing 2.\nI hope to see you all at the\nIFreshers' U GM on Thursday 6th, in\n|the JCR.\nEvents Hon Sec\nIan 'wendy' Morris\nMy intention of having an\norganised, perhaps even relaxed,\nSummer were completely wrecked\nby the postal strike which meant\nthat arrangements were delayed\nuntil the last few weeks before the\nterm started.\nUnder normal circumstances all\nFreshers would have received a big\nbrown envelope containing\nhandbooks and other goodies at\nleast two weeks prior to arriving at\nCollege. You may already have\nreceived this envelope by the time\nyou read this but if not you'll be\ngetting one at the Rector's reception.\nThe events for Freshers' week are\ndetailed in the handbook on page 15\nand a week ticket (for which a form\nis in the envelope) covering entry to\nthe events on Monday, Wednesday\n& Friday can be obtained for \u00a39 after\nthe reception outside the great hall,\nin the Junior Common Room (JCR)\nand on the first floor of the Union\nBuilding (where you also get your\nUnion cards). The week's entertainments are well worth going\nto and should keep you busy, if a little tired. Over the next few weeks\nthere will be regular discos, bar\nquizzes and Ents gigs all of which\nare detailed in the term planner as\nwell as special events like Rag Week\n(see pages 12 & 13 of the handbook).\nIf you are at all interested in\ngetting involved with College\nentertainments, have a word with\neither myself or Paul Watkiss, the\nEnts Chairman. Don't be put off\nbecause you are new to College; this\nyear's Ents Hon Sec was a Fresher\nlast year who began helping out at\nthe New Year's Party even though\nhe had already paid to get in!\nOn a different note, there are a number of Union positions which\nhave been left vacant due to\nexamination failure. These positions\nare:\nExternal Affairs Officer\nWelfare Officer\nAccomodation Officer\nHouse Committee Chairman\nFELIX Business Manager\nPublicity Officer\n:\nPapers for these positions will be\nup by the time this issue comes out\nin the main entrance to the Union\nBuilding (near the photo booth) and\nwill remain up for ten College days.\nA proposer and ten second ers are\nrequired for each candidate and the\nelection will take place at the second\nUnion General Meeting (UGM) on\n25 October.\nIf you want any further\ninformation on these positions, drop\ninto the Union Office and have a word with either myself or Nigel.\nSpeaking of UGMs, the first of\nthese is on Thursday at 1.00 pm in\nthe JCR. Unlike many student\nUnions, Imperial's is apolitical so\ndon't let any stereotypical\npreconceptions prevent you from\nfinding out what the meetings really\ndeal with.\nOn Tuesday (tom morrow) afternoon, the Freshers' Fair will\ntake place all over the College\ncampus. Take your time to wander\nround the stalls and find out what\nthe clubs and societies have to offer.\nFinally have an enjoyable year and\nmake time to enjoy the social\ntimetable available this year.\nPresident\nNigel D Baker\n1. Accommodation. I have\nappointed the Wardens and Student\nManagers of Hamlet Gardens,\nCollingham Place and Gerrard\nMansions. There has also been a survey of all the halls and houses to\nbuild up a database of the\nac como dati on stock of IC.\n2. External Affairs. The DES survey\nof student Unions and their\nassociations with the NUS has\nstarted. I have written to the DES\nasking why ICU, the only Union of\na reasonable size not in the NUS,\nhas not been included in those\nsurveyed.\n3. Postgraduate Affairs. I am in the\nprocess of setting up a system of\ndepartmental representatives for\npost grads which is to run along the\nsame lines as the current Dep Rep\nsystem. An open meeting for all\npostgraduates held in September\ni fell foul of postgraduate apathy and\nso this is to be pursued along\ndepartmental lines with any\napathetic department being left to\nstew in its own mess.\n4. Welfare. I have been in\nconsultation with UL U with a view\nto appointing a joint ICU/ULU\nWelfare advisor. This proved\n| fruitless and so I'm now looking into\ni the funding for a full-time ICU\nj Welfare advisor. There will be the\nlargest survey of IC students ever\nattempted this term. All 5,500\nstudents will receive a survey paper.\nIn the past problems have been\nencountered with collation and\nanalysis of the data. This year I have\narranged for \"Audience Selection\",\na market research company, to do\nthis for us, free of charge. There will\nbe a follow up survey in the\nSummer term. This second survey\nwill measure how attitudes have\nchanged after the four campaigns\nthat will be run this year. These are:\n(i) Alcohol awareness 28 Nov - 3\nDec.(ii) Sexuality awareness 9-14\nJanuary.(iii) Drug abuse/healthy\neating 14-18 February, (iv)\nDHSS/Housing awareness 6-11\nMarch.\n5. St. Mary's.I have had several\nmeetings with Phil Drew, the St.\nMary's President, and we have set\nup a working party which includes\nmyself, the ICU DP and the three\nCCU Presidents. This working party\nis to cover what we have identified\nas 13 discrete areas and it should\nreport back by March next year.\n6. Transport. Now that I am\ncovering the administration of the\ntransport fleet I will be taking a very\ntough line with regard to bills and\nabuses of the fleet.\nOct ber 3 1988 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

    "content": "Food\nFood the elixir of life\nby Yishu Nanda,\nFood Correspondent\nLast year Felix's own gastronomic column\nlooked at eating in far away places likes Paris,\nRome and Venice. I hope I managed to\ninspire, you to be adventurous when eating\nout on your travels during the holidays. This\nyear my task will be to encourage you to\nexplore the mind blowing experience of\ntitillating the palate in London's cosmopolitan\ncorridors of gastronomy !!\nI begin the new series of articles by looking\nat places within the central zone which are\npopular with the students every year, and\nsome which are my special tips.\nEating Italian\nSpago\n5 Glendower Place, S. Kensington\n(Only 5 minutes away)\nI reviewed this restaurant for the first\nPostgraduate Felix over the Summer. I gave\nit a relatively good review only to find myself\nhounded by people muttering ' how could\nyou recommend Spago ?'. The place has been\nrecommended by a number of Italians at the\ncollege. I will for the record state that their\npasta offerings were good. The 'spaghetti\ncar to c cio' in which the chef produced a great\ncombination of squid, muss les, prawns and\npasta is a must, but the pizzas should be\navoided. '\nThe starter of 'pros cu it to mel one', a spaghetti car to c cio, a Peroni beer and an\nexpress o cost me just \u00a37.50p, giving good\nvalue for money in South Ken.\nBar Italia\nFirth Street\n(opposite Ronnie Scotts)\nTube Leicester Square.\nYou might find it useful to know about this\ncorner of Italy in London. It's a1950s style\nItalian cafe in the heart of our city. Just go\nthere to enjoy an express o. It gets packed with\nthe Italian ex pats on Sunday evenings\nenjoying the Italian football being screened .\nFatso's pasta joint\n13 Old Compton Street, W l. Tube Leicester Square.\nSun noon-10.30pm. Mon-Thurs noon-11.30\nFrid, Sat noon- 12.30am.I do not think that I will be going here, but ,\nit should appeal to students who like to hog\nthemselves on pasta and one of the number\nof sauces available. For \u00a32.80p you can have\npasta and one of their sauces , and between\nSunday and Thursday you will keep having\nyour plate filled at no extra cost .\n'What DID you put in this, Yishu ?'\nRussian\nLubas Bistro\n6 Yeoman Row, Knightsbridge\n( 5 minutes away).\nMon-Sat 6pm midnight.\nCost \u00a37-12\nReservation necessary Free Corkage allowed!!\nThis bistro has proved popular for many a rowdy student binge! They have a large\nnumber of tempting starters including a cheese dumpling, a hearty onion soup and the\nclassic beetroot soup which keeps the cold\nRussian winters at bay. The main courses\ninclude Kafpiv (grilled cod : expensive at \u00a37),\nZraza (breast of chicken stuffed with\nvegetables), Beef Stroganoff ( beef cooked in\nsour-cream sauce) and Chicken Kiev amongst\nothers. Lubas has yet to disappoint someone\nI know who has been there.\nIndian\nThere are nearly 5000 Indian restaurants in\nLondon. Though one might think that one is\nspoilt for choice many places prove to be a disappointment. I will highlight a few\ninteresting places.\nDiwana Bhel Poori House\n121 Drummond Street, NW1\nTube Euston Sq.\nor\n50 Westbourne Grove, W2\n7 days, noon-ll pm Tube Bayswater\nThis has got to be a haven for vegetarians.\nIt is always a pleasure to eat here. They serve\na well chosen number of snacks which are\npopular in many parts of India. Do not miss\nthe opportunity of trying the 'dha ib halle', the\n'b hel poor i', or the 'a loop ap rich a at'. Whilst\nyou might not want much more if you have\nmore than 2 snacks, there will always be the\ntemptation to have a' massa la dosa' or the\n'rava dosa'. An important feature of Diwanas\nis their house th ali which includes some\nb haji as, a dal, two vegetable dishes, rice, ra it a, pickles, and dessert for just \u00a33.90.\nGullistan Kebab House\nOn New Road near London Hospital.\nOpenings Unknown, but try 6pm9 pm. Tube Whitechapel.\nCost Very cheap.\nThis place (?!) I stumbled upon in the East\nEnd has got to be one of its kind. It is popular\nwith the Muslims living in the area. The food\nis cooked freshly every day in small batches\nin a small kitchen open to view behind the\ncounter. When things run out, tough, you\nhave to eat something else. The last time I went there they were offering 'seek h kebabs',\n'kee ma samos as', a quail dish, and a number\nof vegetable dishes.\nMost people seemed to buy things to take\naway, although they had seating capacity for\nabout 10 people. I stopped recommending this\nplace to people after I took someone there who\nbecame distressed about the seedy\nsurroundings. Well, it is in the East End and\nwe are students, so one cannot be snobbish.\nI think you would enjoy the experience of\ngoing to Gullistan but do not take someone\nyou want to impress.\nPage 6 FELIX October 3 1988\n\n"

Directed by Judi Dench.\nMuch Ado About Nothing is not one\nof those Shakespearian plays which\nis full of memorable quotes, nor is\nit one that gives any great insight\ninto the Bard's life. It is (or is played\nhere as) a grand farce with more\nthan a hint of black humour and a generous helping of tragedy.\nThis production, by the\nRenaissance Theatre Company, also\nmarks the directorial debut of the\nactress Judi Dench who has decided\nto move the play forward in time but\nwe are left in doubt as to exactly\nwhich century. The plot, like any\ngood farce, could be described as\nconvoluted.\nBeatrice (Samantha Bond, recently\nseen as Rumpole's over eager\nassistant Liz Probert) and Benedict\n(Kenneth Branagh, of Fortunes of War\nfame) are engaged in a merry yet\nvitriolic battle of the sexes. The two\nhave had nothing good to say about\neach other for many a year but have\nnever actually met. This all changes\nwhen the army of Don Pedro, the\nPrince of Arragon, and his bastard\nbrother Don John, returning\nvictorious from battle, stops at the\nhome of Leonato, the Governor of\nPadua. Benedict is a soldier in the\nPrince's Army and Leonato is\nBeatrice's guardian.\nSoldiers who have been away for\nso long think of only one thing and\nthe moment they arrive at Padua\nthey set out to get it. Claudio,\nBenedict's greatest friend, falls for\nLeonato's daughter Hero and\narranges to marry her while\nBenedict, a confirmed bachelor,\nmocks.\nHowever, a conspiracy is afoot:\nLeonato, Claudio, Don Pedro and\nHero feel that Beatrice and Benedict\nwould make a lovely couple and\nattempt by foul means or fouler to\npersuade each that the other secretly\nloves them.\nGot the picture so far?\nThis is where it gets complicated.\nDon John is not only a bastard but\na bit of a so-and-so as well and as\nall good villains should, he sets out\nto make som body' s life miserable.\nHis targets are Hero and Claudio\nand with the help of a couple of\nminor crooks of varying degrees of\nincompetence, he sets out to break\nup their happy engagement!\nAdd to this, a household of\neccentric servants and a police force\nwhich would not be out of place in\nthe Keystone Cops led by a tongue\ntied commander and you have all\nthe elements of a great farce with the\npossible exception of a job lot of\ndirty books and a visiting\nmother-in-law.\nKenneth Branagh's Benedict is\nplayed with tongue in cheek and\nego on show, a definite pig of,the\nmale chau veni st variety. While\nSamantha Bond's Beatrice is a truly\nindependent woman with more\nthan a passing resemblance to the\ndirector Judi Dench. Their marriage\nwould certainly be explosive.\nTam Hoskins as Hero, one of the\nfew non-comic parts, seems under\nused and only really gets her chance\nin scenes when Hero has histrionics.\nRichard Easton's Leonato is in a permanent state of admirable\nconfusion, Shaun Prendergast plays\nthe villainous Don John as an\noversized Napoleon and Jay Villiers\nis entertaining as Borachio, one of\nDon John's drunken, incompetent\nhenchmen. But special mention\nmust go to David Lloyd Meredith as\nthe police commander Dogberry\nwho has a mispronounce and\nmis phrase Shakespearian English,\nwhich can be difficult to follow at\nthe best of times, and yet still\nsucceeds in keeping the audience in\nstitches.\nIt is not without faults; it can be\nconfusing, is a little overlong and\nmore help with the story would not\nhave gone amiss, I had to look most\nof it up later. While some of the\nactors seemed to be shoehorned into\nparts that are just too small for\nthem, notably those of Hero's and\nBeatrice's attendants. This is\npartially the fault of the\n'Renaissance Theatre Company'\nitself: Much Ado is being played\nalongside Geraldine McEwan's version of As You Like It and Derek\nJacobi's Hamlet with the same cast\nand hopefully the supporting actors\ngiven meatier parts.\nSo, if you want an entertaining\nnight out, I would advise that you\ngive both When Did You Last See Your\nTrousers and Run For Your Wife a miss and try and get yourself tickets\nfor Much Ado About Nothing (playing\nuntil October 29).\nJason Lander.\nMasquerade is billed as a 'film noir of\n!\nthe 80s' combining 'love and deceit\nblending their elusive attractions to\nbecome a catalyst for murder with\npassion and suspense', this is\n,suspiciously like the drivel written\nI on the back of blockbusters by Jackie\ni Collins and Shirley Conran and it\naptly describes the sort of film\nMasquerade is, with one exception,\ni the plot in Ms Collins' books is at\nleast plausible and simple enough\nto hold together the story between\nthe naughty bits. In Masquerade the\nplot is so convoluted that it totally\nfalls apart and there are only two\nsmutty bits to hold one's attention.\nMasquerade is about a poor little\nstinking rich girl in the opulent\nHamptons, New York where all the\nhouses cost at least ten million\ndollars. Olivia is wanted for her\nmoney by Tim, wanted dead for her\nmoney by Tony, her wicked\nstepfather, and just wanted dead by\nJMike for reasons not entirely\nIobvious. And so the scene is set for\ni murder and passing amongst the\nAmerican gentry and their lavish\nlifestyle.\nNone of the characters ele c its much sympathy from the viewer.\nTony deserves some simply because\nhe is so consistently nasty and it is\nthus apparent that his role is to be\nshort lived. The director says that it\njis 'essential that the leading\nIcharacters are different at the end of\nthe story than they were at the\nbeginning'. As four of the six stars\nand a rat are dead by the\nculmination it can be assumed that\ni he achieves his aim, albeit rather\nradically.\nMasquerade is well acted, well\nmade, but abysmally written and is\nnot really good enough to merit\nis pending grant money on.\nCD.

    "content": "Feature\nEdinburgh 88\nOne of the most wonderful cities\non earth is Edinburgh during the\nInternational Festival. There are\nthousands of people from hundreds\nof nations. There are spectacular\nfirework displays, the military\nTattoo in the castle that seems to\ndominate all Edinburgh and\neverywhere you look are the\ntheatres and venues of the Festival\nFringe. It is a breathtaking dive into\na cultural and artistic pleasure\nground.\nOne of the five top venues on the\nFringe is Theatre West End, situated\nin the hall of St. John's Church, at\nthe west end of the main shopping\nthoroughfare, Princes Street. This is\nnot, however, run by a professional\ncompany but (mostly) by students\nfrom Imperial College.\nPreparations for the three brief\nweeks of the Festival begin in\nDecember when the Administrator,\nTechnical Co-or d in at or and the rest\nof the organising committee are\nelected. They work for nine months,\nbasing with the theatre groups to\nwhom the venue is sublet,\narranging technical facilities for\nthem, hiring equipment, leasing the\nactual hall and carrying out the\nthousands of tasks that must be\ncompleted in order to make the\nvenue perfect for the opening night.\nActivity comes to a head\napproximately two weeks before the\nFestival opens, when all the\nequipment, costumes, props and\npublicity are brought together. On\nthe Saturday before the festival\nopening, people are bullied, cajoled\nor forced to assemble to load\neverything into the van which will\ntake it all to Edinburgh. This is a seemingly endless handling and\npassing of heavy boxes, boards and\nplastic sacks which are fitted into the\nvan like a three dimensional jigsaw.\nThe van departs and everyone\nthen tries to get themselves to\nEdinburgh, by train, coach or car\n(which didn't prove to be the most\nreliable method this year!). This is\nbrief respite before reaching\nEdinburgh, where the van is\nunloaded. (Much the same as\nloading except that everything has\nto be carried further, and round\nsome awkward corners.) And then\nthe set up begins.\nIn four days a bare church hall is\ntransformed into a one hundred and\ntwenty seat studio theatre, complete\nwith raked seating, a sophisticated\nsound and lighting system, and\npainted black throughout.\nThis may not sound much, but it\nis four long days of very hard work,\nwhich can be frustrating, exhausting\nand unpleasant by turns, but which,\nultimately, end in a great sense of\nachievement.\nOn the Thursday the theatre\ninspectors visit and fortunately\ngrant us our theatre licence.\nFrom Friday the sublet theatre\ngroups arrive (bringing, usually,\nincredible amounts of props and\ncostumes, and making impossible\nlast minute demands on the\ntechnical resources) and the first\nperformance occurs on Friday night.\nA theatre has been born in less than\na week.\nBut why do students from\nImperial put themselves to so much\ntrouble ? The main reason is so that\nIC Dramatic Society can themselves\nperform at the Fringe. The cost of\nhiring a venue is so prohibitive that\nit becomes the only viable way to\ntake productions to the Fringe. This\nyear three productions were taken\nup.\nDusa, Fish, Stas and Vi by Pam\nGems is a play about the interaction\nof four women and the way in\nwhich they support and protect\neach other. This play gave the\nopportunity for the strong presence\nof good actresses in ICDS to show\ntheir abilities.\nRumblings by Peter Gibbs, on the\nother hand, is a sharp black comedy\nabout life in the office of the future,\nwhere work is minimal and tensions\nare running high. The actress in this\nplace made her stage debut in this\nperformance, and the play was well\nreceived by its audiences.\nTalk to me like the rain and let\nme listen, by Tennesse Williams\nwas a two hand er set in an\napartment in Manhattan, where a couple are undergoing a reunion -or finally drifting apart. This\nprobably contained the most\nchallenging part in any of the plays,\nand Portia Smith did justice to her\ntheatre that took four days to build\nis taken apart, packed away and\nsent back to London. A bare church\nhall reappears once more. However\nnobody much cares at that point,\nbecause it is seven o 'clock in the\nmorning and we have been working\nsince half past ten the previous\nnight, mostly on auto-pilot, and all\nwe want to do is sleep.\nBut being a part of Theatre West\nEnd is more than just creating and\ndestroying the theatre and carrying\nout the day to day tasks such as\noperating the box office, acting as a 'responsible manager' for the venue\nor staffing the front of house. It is\nabout promoting your own shows\nand terror ising the passing crowds\ninto seeing you. It is about chatting\nto other theatre groups who are\nleafleting you, and finding out what\nthey are doing and what they have\nseen. It is about having a strong\nconstitution and sitting in the Fringe\nclub until three in the morning and\nthen getting up at nine after far too\nlittle sleep.\nAbove all Edinburgh is about seeing\ntheatre, revues, concerts, serious\ndrama, farce and the unbelievably\nstrange. I think the Edinburgh\nten minute speech during which she\nmaintained a convincing American\naccent. This played as a double bill\nwith Savagetove by Sam Shepherd,\na series of love poems, delivered by\na cast of four, casting new light on\nthe pains and pleasures of that\nemotion.\nThe saddest part of the Edinburgh\nexperience occurs when, after three\nweeks and fifteen shows, the strike\nhappens. In nine or ten hours the\ncultural experience is best summed\nup by the following: we wandered\ninto a theatre because we were\nnearby and they had a performance\nstarting in twenty minutes time. We\ncame out shaken by the most\nbrilliant piece of theatre I have ever\nseen. The company that produced\nthis (The Faith Healer by Brian Friel)\nwas not a professional outfit but\nEdinburgh University Dramatic\nSociety.\nPage 12 FELIX October 3 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nHalf a feature on the history of language\nFirst words\nSince the dawn of mankind the\nimportance of language has made it\nan object of fascination and magical\nproperties. Ancient man, and even\nthe more 'primitive' peoples of\ntoday, believed that to be able to\nname a thing was to control or\npossess it\u2014an attitude that survives\nin more developed societies with the\nuse of euphemisms for harsh\nrealities, such as death.\nTo be able to name\na thing was to\ncontrol or possess it\nThe link may not be as direct as\nthis, but language is nevertheless\nessential for the workings of human\nsociety. It is one of the clearest\ndifferences between man and other\nanimals, and its development has\nmade possible some of the most\nrapid changes the human race has\ngone through. Without language\nthe transmission of new ideas and\nhard-earned knowledge would be\nimpossible. The effect is seen in that\nwhile man has rapidly changed in\nhabits and speech, there is no\nevidence to show that animals,\nwithout the ability to pass on\nacquired knowledge, have\nsignificantly changed in their basic\nhabits over comparable amounts of\ntime.\nRecognising the position of\nlanguage as one of the strongest\nbonds in society, people have been\nfascinated by the question of its\norigin throughout history. The\nBiblical story of the Tower of Babel,\nfor example, shows some early\nbeliefs about the subject.\nNow the whole world had one\nlanguage and a common speech. As men\nmoved eastward they found a plain in\nBabylonia and settled there.\n... Then they said, 'Come let us build\nourselves a city, with a tower that\nreaches to the heavens, so that we may\nmake a name for ourselves and not be\nscattered over the face of the whole\nearth.'\nBut the Lord came down to see the city\nand the tower that the men were\nbuilding. The Lord said, 'Ifas one people\nspeaking the same language they have\nbegun to do this, then nothing they plan\nto do will be impossible for them. Come,\nlet us go down and confuse their\nlanguage so they will not understand\neach other.'\nSo the Lord scattered them from there\nover all the earth, and they stopped\nbuilding the city. (Genesis 11)\nThis story illustrates several\ninteresting points. Firstly it suggests\na divine interest in speech. Next, it\nacknowledges the power language\ngives man in relation to his\nenvironment. And lastly, it attempts\nto explain linguistic diversity\u2014the\npresence of so many different and\nmutually unintelligible languages.\nThe idea of a divine interest in\nlanguage is found in several\nindependent traditions. While the\nBible, relating ancient Jewish beliefs,\ndescribes God as bringing the\nthat of the Bible, whereas Indian\nlegends say that the god Indra\ninvented articulate speech. Even the\nancient Greeks in various writings\nmention the gods as having first\nfixed the names of things, and credit\na figure from myth with producing\nthe first alphabet from an earlier\nPhoenician script. Writing in general\nwas regarded with awe; the Norse\ngod Odin was said to have invented\nthe runic script, and over time the\nrunes themselves acquired magical\nsignificance.\nMore scientific explanations for\nthe origin of language have been\nsought from early times. The Greek\nhistorian Herodotus tells of an\nexperiment by Psammetichus, King\nof Egypt, to find out whether the\nPhrygians were an older race than\nthe Egyptians.

    "content": "Feature\n'...a calm delight which is\ninexpressible and which no\nsituation on earth could give.'\nVincent Lunardi (1784)\nThroughout history people have\nbeen fascinated by the seemingly\nimpossible, being able to fly is one\nof them. In 1783 flying left the\nrealms of fantasy when the first\never 'aircraft' made its maiden\nvoyage over Paris. The French\nMontgolfier brothers had\nconstructed a hot-air balloon out\nof paper and powered by a fire\nmade of burning straw and twigs!\nIt rose to 1000ft but soon fell back\nto earth as the hot air escaped.\nA few months later Professor\nCharles, a physicist, filled a rubber-coated balloon with\nhydrogen and the first gas balloon\ntook off. Landing just outside\nParis it was attacked by peasants\nwho thought it was the devil.\nSince hydrogen has better lifting\nproperties than hot air, gas\nballoons could be smaller and\nmore practical than the\ncumbersome and rather\ndangerous hot-air ballon s. Hot-air\nballooning had died a quick\ndeath.\nHowever, 200 years later hot-air\nballooning re-emerged when Don\nPiccard was commissioned to\ninvestigate the military\npossibilities by the United States\nNavy in the 1960s. The balloon\nwas to be built from light-weight,\nhigh tension rip-stop fabric and\nhave a powerful propane burner\nsystem. Although this application\ndid not develop, the sport of hot-air ballooning had been born,\nthanks to modern technology.\nToday traditional gas ballooning\nis rather out-dated with its bags\nof ballast, ropes and anchors.\nLittle has changed over the past\ntwo centuries except that helium\nis used instead of hydrogen (the\nHindenburg disaster high-lighted\nthe dangers of using hydrogen!).\nA hot-air balloon can be inflated\nvirtually anywhere and much\nmore quickly than a gas balloon.\nSince the operating costs of hot-air ballooning are a fraction of\nthose of a gas balloon, hot-air\nballooning has become popular all\nover the world.\nBalloons can take you out of this\nworld in the most graceful style.\nTo float away is to realise the\nfantasy of living in the clouds.\nOne is surrounded by a totally\nunearthly beauty, free at last from\nlife's problems. To ride with the\nwind is to experience tranquillity\nand real adventure.\nAs the balloon takes off there is\nno real upward sensation as in an\naeroplane, but rather, the earth\njust drops away from under your\nfeet. The land below takes on new\ndimensions\u2014fields and lakes\nstitched together in a multi-coloured quilt stretching in all\ndirections.\nIn level flight the balloon is in\nequilibrium. To go up by\n'burning' the blast-valve is\nopened. This causes a7ft flame to\nshoot into the envelope and heat\nthe air. To come down one can\neither allow the balloon to cool or\nopen a vent in the top of the\nballoon allowing hot air to escape\ngiving a more rapid descent.\nThe balloon's direction depends\nsolely on the wind but pilots can\nattempt to 'steer' by changing\naltitude since different wind\ndirections can occur at different\nheights. In the end though, the\nballooning becomes a magical\nmystery flight to an unpredictable\ndestination.\nThe most testing part of any\nflight, whether by Concorde or\nballoon, is the landing. But it is\nonly balloonists who must suffer\nthe indignity of being dragged\nacross a field in what is essentially\na wicker basket! Pilots take great\ncare to avoid landing in farmers'\ncrops, near animals or near\nelectricity pylons. If everything\nhas gone well the retrieve crew\nwill be waiting nearby, having\nsuccessfully tracked the balloon to\nits final resting place. It is not\nuncommon for 'retrieve' to get\nlost or the pilot to land in the most\ninaccessible spot.\nIt is now possible to make\nalmost any object fly! Special\nshaped balloons are flown at\nmany balloon fiestas around the\ncountry. Have you ever seen a flying Donald Duck, ice-cream\ncone, FT paper, Sydney Opera\nHouse, motor bike, dragon... to\nname but a few!\nEver fancied flying? Now may\nbe your chance\u2014anybody can do\nit!\nJan Vonka DOC 4\nBALLOON\nFEATURE\nRide\nwith the\nwind\nBOOK REVIEW\nHerbs\nand\nhermits\nvie ne \u2022 j \u2022 j The Hermit of Eyton Forest is the\nfourteenth and last (so far) of a series by Ellis Peters. Set around the\nAbbey of St Peter and St Paul in\n12th Century Shrewsbury, the\nbooks are described as 'mediaeval\nwhodunnits', but they are both less,\nand more.\nThose looking for a fiendishly\ncomplex, fast-paced plot can stop\nreading here. The story is based\nfirmly in the slower rhythms of\nmediaeval life; indeed it is in part\nthe meticulous detail and authentic\natmosphere which make all the\nbooks in this series a pleasure to\nread.\nThe plots themselves are usually\noriginal and intriguing, often resting\non some historical detail such as, in\nThe Hermit of Eyton Forest, the\npractice of marrying young children\noff for the sake of their estates. The\ncivil war, with King Stephen and\nEmpress Maud fighting for the\nEnglish throne, is ever-present in\nthe background and though we are\nspared tedious descriptions of the\ncourse of the battles, we are told\nenough to explain the motivations\nand actions of many of the people\nin the stories. I can't vouch for the\nhistorical accuracy, but it sounds\nwell-researched and convincing.\nDespite the amount of specialist\nknowledge involved, the author\ngenerally plays fair, not withholding\nvital information needed for the\nsolution. Unfortunately this means\nthat the crime, if there is c ne, is\nusually solvable well before the end\nof the book. On the other hand, one\ncan then relax and enjoy the way the\ncharacters resolve their various\nproblems.\nWhat makes this series worth\nreading as far as I am concerned is\nthe main character. Brother Cadfael,\nin charge of the Abbey's herb\ngardens and the medicines (and\nwines) made from its produce, is the\nkind of man I'd be proud to know,\nlet alone to have invented. A warrior\nin the Crusades before taking his\nvows, Cadfael has a practical faith\nthat sees looking after people as\nmore important than the prescribed\nround of worship in church, yet is\nso contented in the service of God\nthat it makes even a confirmed nonbeliever like myself understand how\nsome people find happiness in the\ncloisters. And who could fail to\nwarm to someone who takes such\npleasure in the rare chance to ride\na horse Kgain, or in looking at\nbeauty in nature or man? Other\ncharacters that come to life in the\nbooks include the capable Hugh\nBeringar, sheriff of Shrewsbury, and\nhis wife Aline, and the not-so-lovable Brother Jerome who helps\nshow that not all who retreat from\nthe world retreat from the search for\npower.\nNot only has the author taken care\nto weave characters and conditions\ninto a readable whole, but the use\nof language is precise and fresh and\nshould please anyone who enjoys\nreading a carefully crafted story. The\nfront covers of the books give a fair\nimitation of an u lumina ted page but\nbear no comparison with the real\nthing.\nThe Hermit of Eyton Forest by Ellis\nPeters (Futura, \u00a32.99)\nOthers in this series:\nA Morbid Taste for Bones\nOne Corpse Too Many\nAn Excellent Mystery\nPage 16 FELIX October 3 1988\n\n"

Improved technology can\ncope with staples, but it helps if\nthere are not too many.\nA tonne of newsprint, equivalent\nto 7,000 national newspapers,\nrequires 10-17 trees worth of wood\npulp.

This is\nequivalent to about 1.3 hectares of\nappointed a student to look into the\npossibility of recycling our paper,\nand in the future to consider other\nforms of waste that the college\nproduces. The prospects are\nencouraging, and hopefully a scheme will be set-up in the next\nfew months.\nAlthough the quality of recycled\npaper is continually improving, the\nmarket for recycled paper is not\nincreasing as quickly as one would\nFELIX passes the acid test for good quality paper\ntrees, and given the time it takes for\na tree to grow, Imperial College\nneeds 50 hectares of trees to keep it\nin good quality paper\u2014an area 7\ntimes the size of the campus. It is\nestimated, that as a country, if we\nrecycled 70-75% of our waste paper\nand board it could save felling 35\nmillion trees every year, or to put it\nanother way, reduce the number of\nconifer plantations.\nTrie natural vegetation in the\nhighlands is actually conifers, but\nrarely did nature grow trees in rows\nand squares. The highlands also\ncontain valuable flow bog habitats,\nideal for rare arctic and tundra birds,\nthese are regarded as poor quality\nland suitable for nothing but trees.\nIn Sutherland and Caithness 50\nhectares of bog land are being lost\neach week! Heavy tree planting in\nthese areas leads to soil erosion, and\nincreases acidity in lakes and rivers.\nTwenty two thousand jobs in\npaper recycling could be created\nwith further reclamation of waste,\nand this is already happening.\nSeveral county councils are\norganising paper collections in their\noffices. The Body Shop Head\nOffices operate a scheme called the\n'Paper Chase'; in the first 9 months\na staff of 80 collected 50 tonnes of\nwaste paper. Consider the potential\nin a college such as Imperial!!\nThis is why the Students Union\nexpect. At the hub of the problem\nis a certain reluctance by the paper\nmills to employ new technology,\nwhich could improve quality and\nreduce the costs.\nThe easiest way to reduce waste\nis not to throw it away until it is well\nand truly used. Living in one of the\nrichest areas of London, I used to\n(and still do) go rummaging through\nskips, and it is amazing what people\nthrow away. I can safely claim to\nhave found over a thousand pounds\nworth of usable good condition\n' rubbish'. \u2022 In College, internal envelopes are\ndesigned to save waste and to save\nmoney, but how many get thrown\naway less than half used?\n\u2022 Use both sides of a piece of paper\nbefore throwing it away. This may\ninvolve writing on the back of\ncomputer print out, or crossing out\na letter and writing on the back.\n\u2022 Learn how to double side\nphotocopies, it is not very difficult.\nIf you make a mistake on a single\nsided copy you can put it in the\nmanual feed and print on the back.\n\u2022Don't buy or use goods that waste\nmaterial. Many goods are grossly\nover packaged. How long is the\npackaging of a McDonalds, or even\na Q.T. Burger, used for? Five\nminutes, ten minutes? and\nthen...CONSIDER THE WASTE.\nThere's money in it...\nThe government may say that recycling must be economically\nviable, but it is questionable whether our present way of living is\nviable in the long run without very much more recycling. Perhaps\nthe government should extend its profit and loss accounting to cover\nthe loss to future decades and future generations as well as our own.\nIt is an ecological truth, as well as an economic one, that there is\nno such thing as a free lunch.' (Sunday Telegraph, 9/3/86)\nBritain annually produces 500 and jars are used in Britain, which,\nmillion tonnes of waste. Of this 23 if thrown away, produces two\nmillion tonnes of waste glass.\nPeople in this country are fairly\nused to Bottle Banks, and possibly\nSave-a Can skips, but now there is\ndawning a new age\u2014Paper Banks.\nCollections by the Civic Amenity\nTrust or other council organisations\nhave been collecting paper door-to-door in some areas for several years,\nbut some councils are now putting\nout skips for people to bring their\npaper to. Similar bins have recently\nbeen seen in Italy, where glass,\naluminium and paper banks are\nlined up together in the street. Some\nAmerican universities also have a similar set-up in the halls of\nresidence. This kind of collection\ncan bring in valuable revenue, as the\nwaste can be sold for reprocessing,\nrather than paying to have it\nremoved and put in a hole in the\nground.\nAluminium can raise 40p per kilo,\nmillion tonnes is domestic waste\nwhich includes about 30% paper\nproducts. A further 30% is other\nrecyclable materials. Sadly most of\nthis goes into a hole in the ground;\nif you are lucky it is burnt, possibly\nfor energy generation. But the\nnumber of holes in the ground are\nnot limitless, as New York has\nfound out, and England will find\nout in the next 15-20 years. Already\nlarge amounts of money are spent\non shifting London's waste into the\nhome counties. Having to transport\nit further, or even abroad, at present\nseems ludicrous, but it could well\nhappen.\nThe long list of damaging effects\nto the environment starts here, with\nthe leaching of concentrated\nchemicals from these landfill\nrubbish tips into our water supplies.\nUsing reclaimed waste, as opposed\nto the 'virgin' raw material, reduces\nCollecting for recycling, the Minnesota university way\nthe amount of energy required to which is about lp for every drinks\nproduced the finished product, and\noften reduces the amount of\npollution and useless by-products.\nMaking paper from reclaimed\nmaterial uses 50% less energy than\nfrom virgin pulp.

    "content": "News\nCollege blocks STA deal\nThe College's assistant finance\nofficer, Malcolm Aldridge, has\nblocked a new Union deal with STA\ntravel to expand and refurbish their\npresent outlet. After seeing the\ncontract for the new deal on Tuesday 21 September, Mr Aldridge\nstopped work on the site on Friday\nof the same week.\nMr Aldridge told FELIX that he\nhad stopped the work because he\ndisagreed with the terms of the\ncontract and was unable to contact\nUnion Manager, Dave Peacock\nbefore work started. Mr Aldridge\nwrote to the manager of ST A travel\nwhen he received the contract on\nSeptember 21, explaining that he\nwas unhappy with it, but did not\ninform the Union. As the person\nresponsible for signing the contract\non behalf of the College, Mr Aldridge felt the contract 'didn't seem evenly balanced '. Mr Aldridge claims that he was unable\nto contact Mr Peacock by telephone,\nbefore stopping the work. Mr Peacock has been busy organising\nthe refurbishment of the Union\nbuilding for several weeks, but\ncarries a portable telephone at all\ntimes.\nMr Baker and Mr Peacock have\nrefused to comment upon the\nincident until further talks have\nbeen carried out with ST A travel.\nThe deal, however, has sup rise d other members of the executive\nsince no mention of the contract was\nmade at the last Executive meeting\nin the Summer.\nThe contract gave a percentage of\nthe profits of the new ST A development to the Union, with the\ncost of refurbishment and expansion\nto be met by ST A travel. Mr Aldridge was unhappy with the\ncompensation clause within the\ncontract which required the College\nto pay compensation to the travel\nagency if they were forced to leave\ntheir newly developed sites within\nfive years.\nMr Aldridge told FELIX that the\ndeal has forced the College and the\nUnion to 'think through' their\nrelationship concerning rooms in College. He went on to say that the\nincident should lead to a 'better\nall be it more formal arrangement'\nbetween the College and the Union.\nThe last conflict between the\nCollege and the Union over room\nusage occured in 1987. Christine\nTaig, Union President at the time,\ndisagreed with the College's use of\nthe Junior Common Room (JCR) in\nthe Sherfield Building as a seating\narea for the College's QT snack bar.\nThe College agreed to pay the Union\ncompensation for the room's use for\nconferences after a student boycott\nof the snack bar.\nBernard Sunley House in Evelyn\nGardens is being upgraded at a total\ncost of \u00a3530,000 to bring it in line\nwith local authority requirements.\nThe house is made up of five\noriginal site, 40 to 44. Houses 40 to\n42 are to gain two extra kitchens,\nthree extra toilets and a new shower\nin time for the beginning of this\nterm.\nThe current wardens' flat is to be\nexpanded and entrances made\nalong all levels between the houses\nto provide two means of escape in\nthe event of a fire. In addition, the\nrooms will be fitted with a new fan\nheating system and individual sink\nunits. The conversion will mean the\nloss of three student rooms to allow\nthe house to meet local authority\nrequirements on kitchen facilities\nand toilets.\nManaging Surveyor of\nResidences, Peter Hallworth told\nFELIX, however, that there would\nstill be an overall increase in student\nplaces in Evelyn Gardens after the\nmerger of Holbein and Mining\nHouse.\nThe cost of the upgrade is to be\nmet from a capital expenditure\nsection of the college residence\naccount. This section holds funds\nset aside for the upgrading of college\nresidences and the upgrade will\ntherefore not be a cause for further\nrent increases.\nHouses 43 and 44 have not been\nconverted this summer and will be\ncharged for at a reduced ' non upgraded' rate.\nThe aborted expansion of STA travel\nhas left the Imperial College Union\nSportshop without a site for\nFreshers' week.\nBookshop and Sports hop manager, Roy Hicks, told FELIX\nthat the Bookshop Management\nCommittee had agreed to relocate\nthe Sportshop. When asked where\nthe new location was likely to be Mr Hicks said 'If I knew I'd be a happy\nman.' He went on to say that he had\n'lost 2 weeks sales which we can ill\nafford to lose.'\nFreshers' week and the following\nmonth are the busiest periods of\ntrade for the Sportshop, which ran\nat a loss last year.\nBernard Sunley\nHouse upgraded\nIC UNION PROUDLY PRESENTS\nTHE\nCENTENARY FRESHERS'\nUNION GENERAL MEETING\nYES!

Their\nhot cheese y mixed vegetables at \u00a3 2 . 2 5 p is\nsupposed to be quite popular.\nFood for thought\n31 Neal Street, WC2.\nMon-Fri noon-8pm Tube Convent Garden\nCost \u00a3 3 - 4 / head. This is reputed to be a very popular\nvegetarian restaurant. Many of their offerings\nchange every day. They offer a number of\nsalads. Some days they offer pasta dishes or\nlemon dishes or parsley dishes. A quiche and\nsalad will cost \u00a3 2 . 7 0 . The apple crumble is\n\u00a3 1 . 2 0 .\nEating Pancakes\nNOT a pancake\nMy 0\n1\n4 Dutch\n131 High Holborn or 221 Kings Road\nMon-Sun noon-10.30pm Tube Holborn or Sloane Sq.\nMany students I have met have praised their\npancakes. The pancakes are made in the\nDutch style and served on 16\" blue porcelain\nplates imported from Holland. There is quite\na lot of choice, but the favourites seem to be\nthe My Old Dutch Savoury ( a pancake w tih bacon, ham, sweet pepper & vegetables\nbathed in cheese) and the banana & sultana\n& creme de cacao pancake.\nA side salad, a pancake, a dessert and a nonalcoholic drink can be expected to set you back\n\u00a3 5 . 5 0 - 6 . 0 0 .\nOc.ober 3 1988\nSome foods (and drinks!) are\naphrodisiacs...\nEating Chinese in Soho\nThe Dim Sum experience.\nIf you have never had Dim Sum then you\ni must earmark a day in your diary for doing\nso. One should think of it as an opportunity\n' to be a gourmet. Rather than eating a lot of\na handful of things one gets small portions of\nsteamed stuffed won tons, a steamed\n\u2022 dumplings, steamed duck's feet. Most items\nwill be served in their individual baskets in\nwhich they were steamed. Most dim sum\n. 'courses' will cost \u00a3 1 . 1 0 but can be as much\nas \u00a3 1 . 7 0 or \u00a3 2 . 5 0 . One can end up spending\nup to \u00a3 8 if you try too many items. Be brave\nand try everything, including the tripe !!\nDim sum is recommended at the New\nWorld Restaurant at 1 Gerrard Place, W l.( Open every day ll:00am ll;45pm, although\nDim Sum is only served up to6 pm). Go on a' Sunday but make sure you arrive just before\n\" 11am. You will find the place full of people,\n\u2022 many of them Chinese.\nWong Kei\n\u2022 41 Wardour St.\nTube Leicester Sq.\nThis must be a well worn spot in the student\neating scene. Although I no longer go there\nI am sure many of you will get to love (!?) the\nplace. The queues to get a seat, sharing tables\nwith other people, and the lousy service give\nthe place a charm of its own. It's so good to\nbe treated like a student because you know\nit will not cost you an arm and a leg. I \u2022 remember that I always used to enjoy their\n\u2022 grilled fish ( a trifle expensive at \u00a3 4 . 7 0 ) and\n\u2022 their Singapore style fried noodles.\nPoons\n. 4 Leicester St. (437-1528)\nTube Leicester Sq.\nOpenings noon-ll pm. Cost Cheap- Marginally expensive.\nI find that this is a pleasant spot in Soho to\ndine the Ladies . I would recommend making\na reservation if you are going on a Friday or\nSaturday, evening. Keep things simple by\ntrying one of their Hot Pots with some rice or\nfor something even cheaper they offer a plate\n' of rice with a large ladle full of cooked meat\nadded over it. There are a number of choice\n; items that can be added to accompany the rice.\nFELIX\nFood\nMalaysian\nMalaysia Hall\n44 Bryanston So..\nTube Marble Arch\nOpenings l lam2p m and 5pm9 pm. Cost Damn Cheap !\nThe hall is run efficiently because of the\nlarge number of Malaysian students in\nLondon. This is a special tip for those of you\nwho would like to get familiar with the\npleasure of eating food with the authentic\nMalaysian touch. \u00a3 1 . 6 0 will get you a rice,\nvegetable dish & a chicken or lamb or squid\ndish. There will not be much variety but you\ncan only ask for so much.\nRasa Sayang\n3 Leicester Sq.\nTube : Leicester Sq.\nCost : \u00a3 1 5 / head. There are occasions when one is in Soho and\n. one does not fancy a Chinese. Consider eating\n. at this restaurant if you do not mind spending\n\u00a3 1 5 / head without wine !\nThe outstanding things to try are the satay\n( skewered grilled pieces of meat served in a peanut sauce), the fish curry, samba lika n bill is( anchovies with chilli sauce) and the rend an. Beef or chicken rend an must figure amongst\n\"the world's gastronomic crown jewels. A heavenly coconut taste is developed by\nroasting the coconut white before it is ground\ninto a paste. The meat is cooked with the\ncoconut paste and other exotic in g redi ents to\nrender a dish fit for a king. A friend spent two\nhours of hard labour to make this dish for me.\nI do not think that Rasa Sayang could ever\nmatch his creation but their efforts should still\nbe worth trying.\nIf you want to avoid the hassle of selecting\nitems from the menu try the 'Nasi Lemak'.\nThis is a whole meal which is normally had\nat breakfast but could be tried in London at\nany time of the day. Coconut rice is served\nwith fish, prawns, egg, cucumber, anchovies\nand chilli sauce.\nGhanian\nGhanian Student's Hostel\n3 Collingham Gardens, SW5.\n7 days, 12.30-6.30 pm.\nTube Earl's Court.\nCost Damn cheap.\nI have never been to eat there but I am told\nit is worth visiting. They cook only a few hot\ndishes each day. You can expect good\nhelpings of Ghanian food.\nGo and eat your hearts out, but do not come\nto me for Alka-Seltzer. If you share my\npassion for food, then keep your stomachs\nglued to this column.\nPage 7\n\n"
