    "content": "16 November 1998 Arts 23\nNATIVE NATIONS: JOURNEYS IN AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY\nBarbican Art Gallery\nPrepare to be convinced - next\nweekend, you're going to a photography exhibition. But first, it's important to locate where this amazing\nevent is happening. Have you ever heard\nof the Barbican Centre? Well, it's in that\nhuge labyrinth of a building. The collection is described as the \"Native Nations\"\nof America. (Basically, pictures of Indians,\nmore pictures of Indians and guess what?\nEven more Indians! Sounds boring, but\nit really isn't. Why should you bother?\nAs I browsed through the different\nrooms, these pictures of people with\nfeathers in their hair and funny clothes\nkind of appealed to me. Strange that, pictures having an effect on me. After all,\nI'm a typical male IC student interested\nin playing Quake, hoping to have a girlfriend before I reach 25 and dreaming of\ngoing out with Lara Croft! So why did\nthese photos move me? I mean, they're\nnot even high-tech, mainly black and\nwhite (even if the stereo graph technique,\nresulting in primitive 3D images, was\nsometimes used), we're a long way from\ncomputerised photos. So WHY then? The\nwhole idea of the exhibition is to show\nhow the \"white settlers\" colonised the\nnative Americans. The story starts in the\n1880s and is told only by photographic\nmeans. It's therefore very visual, so the\nbest way to see what I mean is to go\nthere... However, if I have not yet managed to convince you, try to read the following paragraphs.\nThe Indians refused to be colonised\nand \"move out of the train's way\", but\nwere incapable of stopping it. The result\nwas a systematic extermination of tribes\neither by moving them or just by fighting\nthem. Peace treaties were signed but not\nrespected. A sentence that really shocked\nme was \"killing Indians is a pastime\".\nPoor Indians, they were happy hunting\nand picking strawberries until the ugly\n\"white settlers\" arrived to bother them. I have to admit that I feel very strongly\nagainst these bad guys. Even worse,\nonce defeated, the Indians were showed\nto the world as circus attractions, especially in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.\nThey were not even considered as\nhumans but just as\n\"objects of desire\".\nPictures of them on\npostcards (nothing to\ndo with the ones you\nfind in phone boxes\nthough) and photo\nalbums flourished\neverywhere. Nowadays, kids collect\nfootball stickers not\nIndian cards. Or am I completely in\nanother world? The\nexhibition has original footage of the\nBuffalo Bill Show on\nTV and numerous\npostcards on display.\nThis is where you\nstart feeling sympathy for the natives,\nsince they were\nunable to pick strawberries anymore!\nAnyway, it was\nthought back then that Indians would\nsoon be wiped off the face of the earth\n(a bit like dolphins these days) and therefore some people decided to keep evidence of their existence. This is what\nEdward S Curtis did; he basically spent 30\nyears of his life photographing Indians.\nThis is where the exhibition gets really\ninteresting. This guy knew how lo take a very scenic picture; some of his portraits\nreminded me of Doisneaux's work - out-standing! Often, it's the lighting that\nmakes a picture - he obviously knew\nthat. I also appreciated the medium he\nused: albumen prints. It gives an orange\ncolour a bit like sepia toning. It's worth\ngoing just for the Curtis shots. Moreover, if you have never seen a stereo-graph or a photo gravure before, maybe\nyou should also consider a trip to the Barbican Art Centre.\nIn conclusion, this exhibition is\nalmost moving. The pictures are of good\nquality, the subject is interesting and it\ngives you an idea of Indian history and\nwhat they've been through. From riding\nin the open plains to being in a circus. All\nyou have to do is take the tube and then\nfollow the yellow line. Feel free to send\nany feedback.\nIroQQy\nUntil 10th January\nNearest tube: Barbican/Moorgate\nAdmission: \u00a36, concessions \u00a34.50\nMY LIFE IN ART Etcetera Theatre\nThe plot of this play follows the trials and tribulations (mainly the\nlatter) of a small theatre company\nwhich is rehearsing for a stage adaptation of Byron's Don Juan. When I realised\nthat the production followed the \"play\nwithin a play\" format, I have to admit I was very sceptical. I have always been of\nthe opinion that productions of this type\nwere overly clever and the parallels\nbetween the characters and the characters that they play were contrived and\nforced. As it happened, my thoughts\nturned out to be a load of pretentious\nka k and my scepticism was quashed\nwithin a few minutes of the beginning.\nThe story is farcical and enjoyable.\nThe leading man begins to identify a little too closely with his character (Don\nJuan, the great and famous lover) for the\nleading actress' liking. She has her own\nambitious ideas of seducing the director\nbut, alas, his plans in the seduction line\ninvolve the leading man! A most entertaining love triangle - square even!\n(Although the fourth corner always\nremains hidden.)\nThe play throws many a different\ntheme to the fore:\nyoung love, old love,\ngay love, love vs lust,\nstaying with your\npartner only through\nthe fear of being\nalone and our starry-eyed perception of\nthose we love compared to the real\n\"them\". I suppose\nthat the common\nground on which all\nthese subjects grow\nis the incompatibility\nof us all and the confusion, passion, misery and hilarity which often ensues.\nDamn, I have just made this production appear heavy and a drag to\nwatch - totally unjust. Let me throw in\nsome more suitable adjectives,- sharp,\nwitty, cutting, pace y, clever (very clever),\nslick, modern and oh so, so funny. Yep,\nall of these descriptions apply.\nm%g. This is my\nfavourite type of\ntheatre - exploring\nits real and deep\ntopics fully and intel-li gently. No glibness,\nno piety, no easy\nanswers and still the\ncomplex plot was\nconveyed deftly and\nlightly, the play is\nnot overly \"arty\" -like so many on the\nfringe, yet it is not\nwithout substance -like so many in the West End. A very\nentertaining balance that made me\nlaugh.\nThere are no breathtaking emotional\nperformances; the play does not require\nthem. I he acting at times was hugely\nnatural and at other times very Brechtian.\nThe stylised sections fit in well and arc\njust as funny, particularly the three-way\nphone calls. The use of the original\npoetry from Don Juan seemed to me,\nbearing in mind I had no knowledge of\nit before this play, to be well chosen\nand it was certainly moving.\nThe theatre is situated above a busy\npub, i he Oxford Arms. Camden is the\ncoolest place to spend an evening, so it's well worth a fiver.\nBen\nUntil 29th November\nNearest tube: Camden Town\nPerformance times: daily 7.30pm except\nMondays (Sundays from 6.30pm) Tickets: concessions \u00a35\n\n"

    "content": "10 Music 16 November 1998\nAlbums\nOASIS\nMasterplan J All around the Heathrow Baggage Reclaim Depatment.\nW hat can be said about Oasis\nthat hasn't already been said\nbefore? Washed up has-been s. The last representatives of rock\nn' roll before we're washed away in a wave of new millenium music. Tossers,\ngeniuses, intelligent, dumb, etc. It\nwould be easy to just rehash these old\nmedia gems. In fact, much like the big\nO have done here by cleverly repackaging over a dozen 'classic' B sides in an\neffort to deviously disguise the fact that\nthey haven't actually written any new\nsongs since the Oimean war. OK, so\nthat's an exaggeration but you know\nwhat I mean.\nBut wait, isn't this what people have\nbeen crying out for? A chance to get their\ngrubby little paws on fourteen of the best\nOasis B sides without buying nigh-on\nfifty quids worth of what can only be\ndescribed as good singles. Despite cries\nfrom the irrational Oasis haters, this is a fine crop of songs - all the way from the\nsublime Talk Tonight to the sloppiness of\nNoel's guitar on a boozed-up, live / Am\nThe Walrus. It's the usual Oasis fare of\njan gly Beatles-esque pop to ck with the\nodd whine y vocal thrown in for good\nmeasure, and if this is your bag, the\nalbum as a whole Is hard to fault. There's something for every Oasis junkie: for\nthe aspiring rock star we've got Going\nNowhere; for the moody 'dark clouds on\nthe horizon, the glass is half empty' type\nthere's( It's Good) To Be Free and then\nthere's Stay Young for your dad. [Hey,\nI like that!-Music Ed]\nIf you're less than impressed with\nthe contents of the album, the contents\nof the case are wonderful. The booklet\nthat you get when you had over your\ncash is superb - it's a real bonus for any\ntrue fan. Included are lyrics for each\nsong and a veritable cornucopia of facts\nfor the Stattos amongst you, comprising\n(among others), what the A side was, the\nrelease date, where it was recorded and,\nwell, you get the idea.\nSome of you buffs out there may\nknow (and some of you may not) how\nthis album actually came to pass. If you\ndon'tI 'll tell you, and if you do, tough,\nI'm going to tell you anyway, f he story\ngoes like this: it was decreed by the\nbrothers Gallagher that a mighty poll\nwas to be held over the medium of the\ninternet, where followers of the band\ncould, if they so wished, place a vote for\nwhat they thought was the best B side.\nUpon reading these heart-pouring s of\ntheir most die-hard fans. Oasis released\nMasterplan for their delectation. And the\nworld did rejoice, for it was good.\nYes folks, you heard it here first\n(nearly). Just don't tell anyone that it was\nFelix who told you that this is a commendable album. Granted there are no\nnew tracks and it's the same Oasis formula but for sheer listen ability, to have\nall these rarities in one place and such\ntreasures as Stay Young and the title\ntrack, it's bloody hard to beat. H Christian\nPORTISHEAD^FN\n[* * I Roseland NYC Live\nBALLROOM\nDay After Day\nft\nPortlshead - some people\nsay they're atmospheric.\nPortishead stalk the darker recesses of life, aurally sculpting I larry\ntime's Vienna and Philip\nMarlowe's Mean Streets into rich\norchestrated textures imbued with edgy\nsound effects. Beth Gibbons' vocals\nchronicling unremitting yearnings, stories of loss and portents of doom that\nAshcroft would kill for and Drake died\nfor. The eleven tracks are culled from\nthe genre-defining Dummy and the\nlow-key but equally impressive eponymous follow up, the emotive weight of\nthe songs enhanced through the presence of a30 piece orchestra.\nPretentious? No, just bloody gorgeous\nand somewhat fresh considering some\nof the songs have been doing the\nrounds for a few years now.\nIl um ming sounds like an imminent\nMartian invasion, the soundtrack to Wells'\nWar of the Worlds, until metamorphosis\nheralds a lesson in soul-bearing allusion\nto a state of painful confusion. All Mine\nis John Barry by way of Bristol, epic strings\ngliding like Ali, horns jabbing like fore-man, the great lost song of a James\nBond film. / lal f Day Closing is Pink floyd\nplaying Echoes underwater, washed-out\nvocals and reverberating gu it at. Glory\nBoxprovides perfect evidence for the rip-ping-off of another's work, the Isaac\nIla yes pilfered-strings sounding born-and-bred in Avon. The actual Roseland\nBallroom recordings climax with a truly\nsublime Sour limes, coming over all Ry\nCooder, Paris, lex as style, before a bass-driven rock-out coda.\nWhat follows are Roads and\nStrangers, recorded elsewhere and duly\nsuffering from the change of locale with\na crowd recruited from Luddites 'R' Us.\nHowever, inane hand-clapping aside\n(and I bet some of them had lighters\naloft) the inherent beauty of Roads is\nenhanced in the live arena gaining a whole new touching aura outside the\nconfines of the studio. This is essential\nlistening. H Chris\nT here's an inherent problem\nwith Ballroom. On the one\nhand, they have an ability to be\nfuckin' good. Take the single, Don'f Stop as an example. Majestic, emotionally overloaded, soaring, searing. In\nshort, effortlessly inspiring and uplift-ing. On the other hand, they have the\nknack of sounding crap as well. Take\nthe track, Believe, appropriately placed\nat the end of the album. Dull as shit.\nSo, the only point of debate for this\nalbum is what the proportion of sexy\nson lcs to arse rhythms is.\nThankfully, it swings the right\nway. Opener, Take It is fantastic. A jan-gly undertow of rhythm guitars are the\nveins that the optimistic lyrics are\npushed through resulting in a gorgeous\nrush of us versus them pop. Through\nThe Day continues to please. Vulnerable\nand touching, it shows how they can do\nslow songs without sounding as dull as\nstudent dishwater.\nAll in all .though, they're a band that won't be stepping up in the\ncharts just yet. I low ever, the potential to\nwaltz to the top is there. Ballroom are a band to be watched. Don't say you\nweren't told. CI Dennis\n\n"

    "content": "2 News 16 November 1998\nActivists Picket Tunisian Embassy\nBy Ed Sexton\nOn Saturday 7 November a protest by\nhuman rights demonstrators was held\noutside the Tunisian embassy in Kensington.\nThe protest was intended to coincide\nwith the ll lh anniversary of Tunisian\nPresident Ben Lai's Coup. Since he seized\npower there have been many arrests of\npolitical activists and various human\nrights violations. Amnesty International\nhave reported that \"detainees are tortured by being suspended in contorted\npositions, having their heads plunged\ninto buckets of water and chemicals\nwhile being suspended on a pulley; electric shocks, beatings especially on the\nhead and genitals, and sleep deprivation\nfor up to seven days\".\nTwo thousand so-called 'prisoners\nof conscience' have gone on hunger\nstrike to mark the anniversary, and the\nprotest outside the embassy was\nintended as a show of support for their\naction.\nI Tunisian protesters campaigning outside the embassy Photo: Ed\nissue 1126\n16 November 1998\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nNews Editor: Andy Ofori\nPhotographic Editor: William for enz Music Edilors: Jason Ramanathan and\nDennis Patrickson\nfilm Editor: David Roberts\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nArts Editor: Helena Cocheme\nGames Editor: Gary Smith\nLayout & Photo Editing: Joel Lewis\nBetween fifty and one hundred people stood on the pavement by Hyde Park\nholding banners demanding Ben Lai's removal from power and an end to the\nregime in Tunisia. Several police officers\nwere present outside the embassy, but\nthe afternoon passed peacefully and\nwithout major incident.\nOppression of religion in Tunisia has\nalso been common, with women being\ndismissed from education and work for\nwearing the Islamic veil, which is\nregarded as a criminal offence. The\ndemonstrators feel that thc international\ncommunity has not done enough to\nhelp the Tunisian people, while in Europe\nand America Tunisia is often seen as little more than a tourist destination.\nThc situation seems unlikely to\nimprove in the foreseeable future, with\nthe last report from the Committee for\nthe Protection of Journalists including\nTunisia as one of its top ten enemies of\nthe press.\nBBC Play Big Brother over\nMandy's Outing\nBy Ed Lanyon\nThe past two weeks have seen a massive\nrow blow up over Peter Mandelson's 'outing' as a homosexual, live on the\nBBC's NewsniQht programme. The ensuing media circus illustrated the BBC's seemingly intrusive stance on censor-ship. Following Ron Davies' Clapham\nCommon escapades, Jeremy Paxman\nwas interviewing Matthew Parris, Thc\nTimes' political columnist, discussing\nhomosexuality in the Labour cabinet.\nDuring this discussion Parris announced\nthat Mandelson was \"certainly gay\".\nParris, who later said that Mr Mandelson's sexuality was \"a matter of public record\" was accused of \"attention\nseeking\" by Tony Blair's official\nspokesman. Further claims of hypocrisy\nwere made by others, as Mr Paris chose\nto keep his own homosexuality private\nthroughout his parliamentary career as a Tory MP. Mandelson himself complained\nto the BBC and to the Press Complaints\nCommission. Paxman was seen hand-delivering an apology to Mandelson's house, while Mandelson wrote to Paxman accusing him of maliciously orchestrating the incident.\nThc following day thc BBC issued an\ninternal memo saying \"under no circumstances whatsoever should allegations about the private life of Peter\nMandelson be repeated or referred to in\nany broadcast\". This internal censorship\nannoyed many within the BBC and was\nflagrantly ignored by the Have I Got\nNews for You team who, amongst o th ers, implied that Mandelson's friendship\nwith BBC director general, Sir John Birt,\nmight be earning him favourable treat-ment.\nThe BBC was quick to deny any\nfavour it is m, claiming that the memo simply reinforced their existing policy to\n\"not report speculation about the private\nlives of public figures unless there is a wider issue of public concern\". Thc very\nsame day the memo was issued, how-ever, the BBC questioned Ron Davies\nabout his private life, asking him directly\nif he was gay. When questioned about\nthese apparent double standards BBC\nsources said that Ron Davies sexuality\nwas a matter of \"national significance \"but Mandelson's was not.\nSo who decides what is significant?\nThis is a crucial question as the judgement of this individual will be used to justify both wholesale censorship and future\nintrusions into private lives.\nSpace Age Mirror Makes Light\nWork\nBy Sanjay Sikdar\nOn 1 November a cargo ship docked\nwith the Russian space station Mir in\norder to deliver a nine pound piece of\nequipment. However, come February\nthis plastic object coated with aluminium\nwill be unfolded to form a30 metre\nwide mirror. Thc same cargo ship will be\nused to align thc mirror by remote control so that it will beam sun light to several areas between 30 and 40 degrees\nlatitude.\nII is planned to complete around 16\norbits before falling into the atmosphere and burning up. In the sky it will\nresemble a shooting star but on the\nground it will illuminate an area a mile\nand a half wide. Unfortunately, at this\nstage the Russian scientists may not be\nable to precisely control where this light\nbeam will fall between these two lat i tudes.\nThe idea behind this grandiose\nplan, in light of the economic minefield\nafflicting the country in its transition to\ncapitalism, is to illuminate the perpetual\ndarkness of northern Russian cities. For\ninstance in Siberia, a lack of sunlight\nthrough long winter nights can lead to\nfull blown depression.\nThe experiment was tried before\nin 1 993, but thc mirror was not visible\nfrom the Earth. However, if this test\nproves successful and if the poverty\nstricken Russian space agency can\nafford it, it may be just a prelude to a 'necklace' of mirrors orbiting the entire\nglobe. This could lead to other avenues\nsuch as using the night sky for advertising. Like most things launched into\nspace, the plan has its detractors, for\nyears, astronomers have implored city\nauthorities to use lighting that docs not\nbrighten the cities because it Is hard to\nlook at the stars unless it is really dark.\nProblems with light pollution have worsened as cities expand towards sites\noccupied by observatories. As a result\nastronomical enthusiasts are often\nforced into thc depths of the countryside in the quest for a reasonable view\nof celestial bodies. Instruments\ndesigned for low light levels could be\ndestroyed by thc mirror's brilliance.\nIf more such mirrors are employed,\nother possible future calamities may\ninclude an increase in the current rate\nof global warming or a disturbance of\nthe hibernation patterns of various animal species.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.ic.ac.uk/re lix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at MCP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16- 16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Felix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040-0711\nfelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board.

First Actua Tennis (which was actually very good) and now Actua Golf 3. It\nmust be a marketing scam that hopes\nmemories of warm afternoons will\nencourage the product to shift from the\nshelves, oh and of course the thousands\nof Xmas gift's bought by Great Auntie\nEldrich.\nGolf explained as simply as possible.\nSee white ball. See big stick. Stick hit ball.\nSee ball fly. Ball hit ground. See flag flu t ter. See smaller stick. Stick hit ball (again).\nSee ball roll. See small hole. Ball in hole.\nNow for those who have progressed\npast the golf remedial class Actua Golf 3\noffers both the traditional stroke play,\nmatch play, foursome and four ball games but for those wacky late night\ngolfers in a hurry there is clock golf (play\nquickly or lose a stroke).\nSo what new features have Actua\nincluded, a free pair of baggy plus-fours\nor some rad baseball hat perhaps. Err,\nwell no not really. Apart from the Al\nimprovements and a new graphics\nengine giving an increased frame rate of\n20-25 frames per second (compared to\nActua Golf 2'S1216 fps), they have also\ncompletely redone the control system.\nUsing the Dual Shock or Analog controllers allows complete control of the\npower, swing and the point of impact on\nthe ball. Perhaps it does take some time\nto truly get used to the swing method\nbut after a while you too can be smacking the ball into those sand pits of joy on\nthe edge of the green bits as efficiently\nas the real world beginner. They have\nalso managed to lock up Peter Alliss and\nAlex Hey in a recording studio and\nrefused to feed them cake until they\ncame up with some new comments -luckily Amnesty became involved and\nthey are now both living out a new life\nat the house of a Mr Kipling. Finally in the\ntrue spirit of the new Actua range you\ncan customise your player in whatever\nfashion crime you wish them to parade\nabout the course in.\nSo at the 19th green and looking\nback on a particularly hard afternoons\ngolf it is possible to perhaps suggest it\nis a golf game, and this is the problem.\nUnlike the Actua Tennis game it really is\nnot going to convince the non-player to\nlook at it, which is a shame because like\nmost of the rest of the Actua range it is\na good sports simulation that plays and\nholds the interest as well as it looks.\nGolfers with PlayStations are going to\nbuy or more likely get it bought for them,\nbut if you are a non-golfer go and rent\nit - it might not change your life but you\nmight find another sport simulation\nworth a place in any collection.\nGS\nSettling Down Nicely\nLast Monday was the press launch of\nSettlers III.

    "content": "16 November 1998 Music\nlive AIR\nShepherd's Bush Empire\nAir - Sexy Noise!\nAt the start of '98 when Air\nreleased their most recent\nalbum, A/ toon Safari, a delightful\ntrip through synthesized lounge core\ngrooves with a Gaelic twist, a brand\nnew musical sound had descended\nupon us and without a doubt we were\nhooked. Air have decided to wait for\nnearly a whole year before allowing us\nthe pleasure of sampling the mellow\nMoon Safari live, which if you had to be\nhonest does not contain a strong live\nfeel. Did it work on the open stage?\nRead on....\nThree blok es dressed in uniform white entered the stage and\narranged themselves amongst the four\nsets of keyboards, drums and guitars.\nWithout warning the two on the keyboards started to produce bizarre ethereal sounds in unison and the notes\ncascaded throughout the hall signaling\nthe arrival of the two immense talents\nwho ARE the Air sound. The first track of\nthe night washed over the hall with synthesized glory proving that on hearing Air\nlive, the music sounds more powerful\nand majestic yet at the same time laid-back, aided by the stunning lighting\neffects. Air had the right approach to\ntheir live set, instead of just plodding\nthrough the album (which would have\nbeen the same as listening to it at home\nminus the lighting display), they decided\nto experiment with some songs, mutating Kelly Watch The Stars into a manic\npunk guitar rollercoaster ride while sticking with the vocals fed through a voc oder effect. Sexy Boy was given similar treatment but this time Air moved forward a few years into a Gary\nNuman-esque early '80s style with the\nbass guitarist imitating the slow motion\nrobotic movements much loved by\nKraftwerk.\nThe. first time Air ventured to\nspeak to us with their thick french\naccents, an aspiring comedian burst out,\n'It's inspector Clouseau', so from then on\nsmall talk was kept to minimum. The\nabsolute highlight of the night and the\nmost highly anticipated event was the\narrival of Beth Ili r sch, who guested on\nMoon Safari. As soon as the opening seconds of All I Need began we were all a few steps closer to heaven, with her\nincredibly beautiful voice lifting us higher\nwith every passing second. Air led us by\nthe hand and took us on a safari to the\nmoon, and under their spell we would be\npowerless to resist even if it was only a trip to Windsor. H Jason\nIDLEWILD\nHope Is Important \u2022 * * y2 Idlewild looking clean-cut.\n1 guess soap Is Important.\nIdle wild, possibly the only British\npunk band of any note around at\nthe moment, unleashed a brand of\nrock that's been rare around these parts\nlately on the unsuspecting public with\nthe Captain EP a while back. I lope is\nImportant is their eagerly awaited\ndebut album. Opening with You've lost\nyour way, a few discordant notes, the\nthreat of feedback and a predictable\nstart to the album. Like many of the\ntracks on the record it's all a bit too\nshort by half.\nUncooked, unpretentious, natural,\npassionate, uplifting, enraged, I lope is\nImportant demands to be heard with\nthe volume cranked up to a nose bleed\ninducing level. Ostensibly this record\ntakes the skewed meandering sounds of\nthe (godlike) Pavement and sporadically\nburies it under a filthy, heavy barrage of\nnoise last seen sometime in the 1980s( in\ncase you are wondering this is a good\nthing). Particularly Low light and I'm a Message all demand the highest respect.\nYet even the obligatory slow ones on the\nalbum stand out, particularly the acoustic\nand poignant I'm Happy to be I lore\nTonight and Safe and Sound. The use of\nmore subdued melodic verses followed\nby raw, unleashed choruses is an idea\npatented and used to exceptional effect\nby The Pixies and is not the only American influence on the record. (We've\nalready mentioned Pavement haven't we?) It would be unreasonable to expect\nthe poetic greatness of Yorke, Cobain or\nMalkmus when the best things about this\nrecord all stem from its simplicity and lack\nof consideration.\nOn the down side / lope is Important\nis the not the strongest album lyrically.\nIdlewild seem content to punctuate staple rock lyrics (soul selling anyone?) with\nthe odd memorably abstract phrase.\nImpressive sounding track titles and an\nundeniable grasp of all things of a rock/punk persuasion can't completely\ncover the gaping holes. The ultimate\ncomparison comes when you listen to\nCaptain and / lope is Important consecutively. The over-riding impression you\nget is that I lope is Important just does-n't live up to the promise of the excellent lyrics like Song is a Beautiful Lie and\nSelf Healer from Captain. The rough\nedges that made Captain a masterpiece\nhave been filed off allowing a more pol-is he d, more melodic pop sensibility to\nemerge. Those expecting a band and an\nalbum ready to take the lead towards a punk revival and ultimate revolution in\nBritish music will have to wait for the new\nOasis album (ha).\nIgnoring the frankly awful Close the\nDoor, I lope is important is a gratifying ly noisy, unfashionable, anachronistic,\ncoherent beast of an album. H Craig\n/\n~>^j^11 Singles\nUnkle - Rabbit In Your Headlights\nCalm mellow tune from Mo Wax with an\nalternative jazz flow. Pretty cool.\nStereophonies - Bartender And The Thief\nI his Is an OK effort from the 'Phonics but\nI have heard be lter from them, lune still\nkicking but a little too re pete ti ve.

Just\nnot my bag of chips, really.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Jungle Brothers - Because I Cot It Like\nThat\nThe boyz have come out another top\ntune delivering the wicked verses that\njust make you want to get up and dance.\nIt's got a bit of an oriental flavour with\nthe big beats that lead the tune on.\nRae & Christian feat. Veba - Spell Bound\nThis a cool crisp rune with aD ln fiu en ce kind of flavour, featuring some excellent\nfemale vocals and wicked flute back-ground. Bit of a tune!\nWaste - Hang on\nlune starts off well with lots of enthusiasm but this br t pop tune gets too\nre pet ive. There some other tracks on this\npromo that have more potential but this\ntune is a bit too deflated.\nFuzzTownshend - Get Yerself\nI his track comes out and gets your attention and has a catchy back beat but the\ni he lyrics and the chorus then start getting on your nerves. Apart from that the\ntrack is OK.\nDope Smugglers - The Word\nthis is an annoy ln gly catchy pop tune\nwhich has a bit of bounce to It but it just\ngoes on and on too much, they are similar to Daft Punk in their style but Just lack\nthe delivery H Nim\n\n"

    "content": "18 Film 16 November 1998\nReviews\nStarring : Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafoe\nDirector: Paul Schrader\nAffliction is a deep, dark, heavy-going drama about the impact of\nchildhood family violence on a man's life, and the aftershock which\nthis produces in his adulthood. What\nthe director is trying to show is that family violence and abuse is a hereditary\ndisease - hence the title Affliction.\nMuch like previous movies from the\nsame writer/director (such as Taxi Driver\nand Hardcore) the plot focuses on the\npressures of a man's life; the death of his\nmother, the paranoia which he feels\nabout his friends and the loss of his job.\ntie has to come to terms with bad relations with his ex-wife and the fact that he\nis not perfect in the eyes of his da ugh ter. Being set in a snowy, frigid small\ntown in New Hampshire USA adds to the\nbleak hopelessness that the film tries to\nportray.\nJames Coburn (as the father) and\nNick Nolte (as his son) make for a good\non-screen pairing. Noite plays his part\nwell, after recovering from a shaky, some\nwould say wooden, start. Sissy Spacek\nalso acts well, although her role is a very\ntypecast portrayal of a tormented\nwoman. In fact, the overall standard of\nStop faking It. Just because you've got games this morning...\nacting was convincing, but this unfortunately cannot detract from the mediocrity of the movie.\nThe script leaves a lot to be desired,\nand thanks to several seemingly unnecessary sub-plots the film feels far too\nlong. Whilst these add to the overall\nmood of the film they do nothing to\ncontribute to the overall direction of the\nfilm. Affliction tries too hard to make an\nimpact, and all it su cee ds in doing is\nput ing its audience to sleep.\nNone of the characters provoke an\nempathy, and although the film tries to\nachieve some sympathy for Nolte's char-act er, towards the end you simply don't care whether he lives or dies. It becomes\nincreasingly obvious how the film is\ngoing to conclude, and eventually you're\nleft praying for the film to come to an\nend.\nFor its genre, Affliction is not a ground-breaking movie. Instead, save\nsome money and rent out Paul\nShcrader's classic Taxi Driver. Affliction is\nsimply a made for TV movie with a bet-ter-than-average cast.Q Jon & Alex\nSouth Park Volumes 4 - 6 * * *\nAlmost everyone I know loves The\nSimpsons. But there are pretenders to the throne of the\n\"adult cartoon\" genre. Beavis and\nButthead, King of the Hill and now\nSouth Park. To compete with the cham-pion, any series must offer something a little different. South Park offers us foul-mouthed, irritating little kids.\nFor the benefit of those who haven't yet been victims of the hype, South Park\nfeatures four elementary school kids.\nCartman is the token fat kid from a single parent family, kyle is a misunderstood Jewish kid. Kenny (of \"Oh my God!\nThey killed fame) and his family are\npoor because his father is an alcoholic\nand Stan is physically sick whenever any\ngirl he is attracted to speaks to him.\nIf you've ever been to school, you'll\nfind something to relate to here. Maybe\nyou weren't quite as foul mouthed as\nthese kids, but I 'll bet there was one or\ntwo kids at your school who got picked\non or a common obsession with a particular TV show. No stone is left un turned in South Park: everyone gets the piss\ntaken out of them at some point. It's not\na show for the easily offended. Take a look at the saintly public access show run\nfrom South Park: \"Jesus and Pais\".\nThe other supplementary characters\nare great too. There's Chef, who's like a cross between BA Barracus and Barry\nWhite. If you've got a problem and noone else can help, Chef's bound to have\na spirit raising song on offer, probably\ninvolving laying someone down and\nmaking sweet lu r ve. Mr Garrison is the\nkids teacher. I lis glove puppet friend, Mr\nHead, accompanies him everywhere and\nhis 'persuasion' is a little dubious to say\nthe least. My favourite is the old man\nwho lives up in the hills on the South Park\nGenetic Engineering Range, breeding\nnew species for the common good as\nwell as monkeys with four butts.\nVolumes 5 & 6 cover two episodes\neach. Volume S includes Starvin' Marvin\nand MechaStreisand. In the former, the\nkids accidentally get delivered an 'Eth-er no pian'( sic) child instead of their\nTako\u2122 sports watch. Cartman gets\nreturned to Africa in his place and uncovers the truth behind the relief campaign.\nIn MechaStreisand, Cartman discovers\nan ancient triangle at an excavation site.\nOnce Barbara Streisand discovers that it\nis in fact the Triangle of Zendar, she\nde spar at ely tries to get her hands on it\nso she can complete the Diamond of\nPantheos and become the most destructive force in the world.\nVolume 6 begins with A South Park\nChristmas. The Jews are offended by the\ninclusion of the nativity in the school\nChristmas play and boycott it. Enter Mr\nFlankey, the Christmas Poo, who comes\nout of the toilet every year to give presents to those who have a lot of fibre in\ntheir diets. Finally, Jesus vs Satan features the final battle between good and\nevil, only on pay per view at the cut price\nof $49.95.\nThe problem with South Park is that\nonce you've got over the initial shock of\njust how offensive it is, there's not much\nleft. To be fair, I 've watched MechaStreisand about five times and still enjoy\nit. But the rest just don't do it for me any-more: they're not really re-watch able, which kind of defeats the point of buying the videos. And with only two\nepisodes per tape, it's difficult to recommend them. Q Andy\n\n"

    "content": "16 November 1998\nSuperfluous Elections?\nW hen it comes to elections, Imperial makes Italy look like rank\namateurs. The last time the\nwhole election process ran smoothly, I was wearing short trousers. Still, we had\na nice twist this year. Stuart Cook, stalwart\nof IC Football, pulled out at the last\nmoment, as it were, because of ICU\nExec's rejection of his request to have\nWednesday afternoons off. On the face\nof it, this seems a reasonable decision.\nIt would set a precedent and before you\nknow where you are, you have sabbaticals asking for unacceptable things like\nsleep and a loosening of the ball and\nchain. However, the upshot of this is\nthat once again we have no DP (C&S). This is becoming the rule rather than\nthe exception, which raises several ques-t ions. Since my career as an Olympic\nmiddle-distance runner finished some\nyears ago, I have little contact with the\nsports clubs, so I do not know how they\nhave coped in the past with such situations. Things do not seem to have\nground to a complete halt, with people\nscreaming blue murder, and I doubt that\nit will happen this time. The rea! question\nis not whether Stuart should have done\nthe job -1 am sure he would have taken\ncare of things admirably - but should\nanyone be in that post? Downsizing\nsenior management at Imperial is a truly\nrevolutionary idea, the very mention of\nwhich will lead to cardiac arrests in Suite\nFive. It would do the Union enormous\ncredit if this unfortunate hiccup was used\nas an opportunity to look at the deployment of its sabbaticals. So often ICU has,\nquite rightly, attacked the mismanagement of the College, but these assaults\nhave lost some of their impact because\nof the charge of hypocrisy. Now, of\ncourse, if the Union was as badly run as\nthe rest of IC, it would have closed down\nshortly before the War, but the innumerable committees, borne of a misguided desire to be 'democratic' and\ninclusive, do not help the case. As I have\nsaid from time to time, the fact that committee members are not paid is an irrelevance when considering their situation.\nSabbs earn a fortune (only joking, chaps),\nas you know, and their deployment is\nvital to the smooth running of ICU. For\ninstance, we could end the DP (Clubs &\nSocieties) and create the post of DP\n(Common Sense). A minor alteration for\nthose en amour ed of acronyms, thc\nincumbent could ensure that daft ideas\nsuch as the Union approval of posters\nnever saw the light of day. Could one\nperson assume such a big job? Ooh,\nyou are awful.\nA Point on Petitions\nApathy, being what it is at Imperial,\nmeans that petitions arc rarer than hens'\nteeth in this parish, so it is always nice to\nsee one gracing the pages of Felix, even\nwhen it is as badly written as the effort\nfrom Osa Emohare and co. I was fully\naware that doctors, like me, have\nSimon Baker\nappallingly\nbad hand writ ing, but I never realised\nthat standards of\nliteracy had fallen\nso sharply in medical schools. To be\nfair, I suppose the\nspelling can be\nattributed to the\ndifficulties that text\nrecognition software has with letters written in\ncrayon, but the\nrest is inexcusable.\nIt's not easy to\nextract thc point\nthey are attempting to make, but it\nseems that they\nare having a*\" and the way Voice of\nthat the old\nCollege treats our new medical brethren.\nWhile I have in the past had cause to\nmake comments about the medics that,\nwhile justified, may have seemed a trifle\nbrusque, the article to which they refer\nwas completely inoffensive. The idea\nthat I have a deep-seated prejudice\nagainst medics is cobblers, as offensive\nas the suggestion that Felix is racist. By\nthe way, the majority of students arc\nnot from ethnic minorities, though IC\nbenefits from enormous diversity. In\n1996/97,19.2% of IC students were from\noutside the EU, representing 107 nation-ali ties. You don't get much more diverse\nthan that. As for ethnicity statistics, I suspect the percentage is nearer 25%. You\nwould do well to remember that playing\nthe race card in a situation like this is the\nsurest way to undermine fatally what\nwas already a paper-thin argument. I don't wish to go on and on about this -it's very familiar territory - but it does\nraise an important point. My esteemed\ncolleague, Nick Newton, unwittingly\nmade thc same mistake last week as\nwas made in thc ill-conceived petition. A number of medics seem to think that\nthey are very different from the rest of us.\nNot superior, just different. This view\nstems from\nthe nature and\nlength of their\ncourse. Yes,\nthe medical\ndegree is longer\nthan most degrees,\nbut this does not\nLL place medics in a li'il j ll:;) OV:i|0| lIla ving done a BSi,\n1 I stayed on for a PhD, a fairly com-L mon arrangement.\n%> This means that Ij pf will spend over six\n! years here -1 don't know exactly how\nlong, but if you\n> wander into Shcrlield VI II ' ( .111 Ml them crossing\nReason\nthem off.\nSomeone is\nbound to\nwrite in saying\nthat I'm talking rubbish, but while they\nare clear differences between 'them and\nus', they are smaller than some would\nhave us believe. This self-ghetto is ation is\nvery unhelpful and, I suspect, unrepresentative of ICSM as a whole. It is high\ntime that people just got down to thc\nserious business of drinking in Southside Bar, irrespective of their academic\ndepartment. Some medics seem a little\ntoo sensitive about the inevitable digs\nfrom thc South Ken indigenous pop ul a tion, but this has been going for years;\nit has been suggested by certain elements that the RSM is full of Neanderthals, C&G is little more than an\napprentice school for mechanics and\nthe RCS is full of geeks and gardeners. Of\ncourse, I would not agree with any of\nthat, but that's the way it is, and nobody\nreally minds. So, Mr Emohare, chin up,\nbuy a dictionary and stop being so silly.\nGo and talk to those nice biologists in\nyour new building. They won't bite.\nFinancial Technicalities\nI am troubled. Things seem to be afoot,\nwhich is not good. The Catering Department, of which I have said much, is now\nhaving to pay for its electricity and other\nservices. Not an unusual state of affairs\nI hear you cry, but for a department that\nis as unprofitable as this, it will cause\nthem con side table problems. Perhaps il\nseems like a good time to overhaul the\ndepartment, now that costs have just\nincreased sharply? Don't be daft. Penalise\nnon-profit-making organisations like the\nHolland Club? Ah, now you're talking. If\nthe College thinks that sub sidi sing its\nnon-academic staff social club by waiving\nthe recharging of electricity is wrong, it\nis another example of the misguided\npriorities that so bedevil this place at the\nmoment. While Catering is also a non-profit-making operation (for less acceptable reasons), it is stupid to treat the\ntwo similarly. It is the latest example of\npetty sniping by this department - Southside Bar, the jewel in the crown, was told\nlh at 'College Financial Regulations' prevent the acceptance of guaranteed \u00a310\ncheques, so that ended over the sum-mer. Last year, the Holland Club was\nagain in thc firing line when John Foster\nmade suggestions that Catering should\ntake it over. That silly idea was soon\nquashed, and I'm sure we can do the\nsame this time. Just remember, John,\nthat I eat my lunch in the Holland Club,\nand if the price of my jacket potato rises,\nI shall not be a happy man...\nQAS Systems Ltd is a highly successful computer software\ncompany.

After 55\nminutes the tide swung our way again,\nwith \"Jolly\" Oily Conga tearing through\nthe Queen's defence, sending IC's moral soaring. Seconds later No 8 Duncan Brett skipped over the line to dishearten the opposition further.\nIhe opposition were caught napping\nwhen the Spunk attempted an acrobat-ical dive, but was sent sprawling, knocking the ball on, thus failing miserably to\nscore an easy try. With full-lime rapidly\napproaching, Joe the No 5 smashed\nthrough to score. Final play saw Rich the\nflanker pace over the line after a fantastic forwards move. In the harsh conditions Bully's pu kka boot rung true,\nconverting 6 tries.\nISt XV\nIC 64 - 0 QMW\nA total thrashing of the ponce s from\nEpping Forest, Dave \"God\" got tw at of\nthe day award for having two left hands\nand a mother who comes from Delhi.\nDaa \"Pharoah\" Higazi got Man of the\nMatch for dancing with Lloydy's sister -the diff ren cc today is he scored. Dave\n\"Annabel\" Hogg led by example and\nwas crap. He will be subst it u ed by Virgins' fly-half Clare \"Cockayne\" next week.\nThe pack were rampant and the backs\npenetrating and also showed superb\nrear-guard action, especially Chris \"Dick-in-son\" who missed all his kicks but\nmunched the pon cy wingers.\n(Errmm...Can whoever was previously\nwriting the 1st XV results please come\nback - the above was the best I could\nextract from their match \"report\" - Gus).\nICSM Rugby\nIMPERIAL MEDICALS GO TOP!\nICSM 32-17 Brunei\nThis Wednesday Imperial Medicals went\ntop of the BLJSA rugby premiership with\na convincing win over University College Brunei, the winners of the competition three years ago. The match, played\nat Teddington, where IMRFC remain\nunbeaten for 18 months, is guaranteed\nto send Shockwaves through student\nrugby in this country, as Brunei were\nunbeaten up until this point.\nThe match started well with a try for\nthe Medics by James Piatt, the student\ninternational left wing, which was converted right from the touch l inc by Oliver\nKayes. Brunei only managed a penalty in\nreply before half time, where they made\nthree changes.\nHowever, after half time Brunei\nscored a converted try to take the lead\n10-7, putting immense pressure on the\nMedics. Roused on by excellent support,\nthe pack quickly re-established it's authority on the game and two tries, one by the\nnumber eight Simon Neequaye, and the\nother by the blindside flanker Mark\nGrant, following a complicated back row\nmove, plus another Kayes penalty saw\nthe lead stretched to 22-10. At this point\nthe Brunei team started to resort to\nstamping and kicking as they saw the\ngame ebb away. The best response to\nthis tactic was two more tries, one by\nFielding, and a well deserved try for\nKayes, which saw the game dead and\nburied.\nBrunei scored a converted try with\nthe last play of the match, but nothing\ncould wipe away the smile on the Imperial Medicals faces as the final whistle\nblew, knowing that they had gone top.\nBoth teams will now know that there is\nno team that cannot be beaten on the\nway to the very top of this championship.\nAstonishing Comeback!\nICSM 2nd XV 22 - 20 Brunei\nA more closely fought match than the\nfirsts, saw IMRFC 2nd XV beat Brunei\nafter coming back from 0 -20 down, an\nastonishing comeback. The win included\ntwo tries by the second team hooker\nJustin Hughes, reminding the selectors of\nhis presence and a great all round performance by the young Imperial Medic\nFresher Rob Jeff at open-side flanker.\nThe team captain, Mr William Tuff commented \" All the boys were brilliant today\nbut we couldn't have won it without\nRob, he had a blinder!\"\nThe team in total contained four\nfresher s, one of whom was taken to\nhospital after disc loc at lng his shoulder,\nsomething that only acted as a further\nspur to his team mates, who held on at\nthe death under immense pressure to\nmake this one of the most succ cs ful days in this young clubs history.\nOliver Warren\nDiversions\nAround IC\nMon 16 Tues 17 Wed 18 Thurs 19 Fri 20 Sat 21 Sun 22\nConSoe - Oliver Letwin LabSoc- Ben Bradshaw, Careers Fair, Union Din- Cocktail Night Abandon - dB's810pm Th a Bomb - dB's Standing Room OnlyMP; Huxley 213 1pm Pippard Lecture Theatre\n1pm ing Hall 10am4 pm DaVinci's Bar 5-11pm Common People - ICU\n8pm12 am DaVinci's Bar 4pm CAG Tools for Self ConSoc - Cheryl Gillan ICU COUNCIL 6pm9 pm2 am Reliance - Basement of Quiz Night - DaVinci's MP 1pm Beit Quad 6pm Bar 8pm ClubXS ICU 9pm1 am CAG Soup Run 8pm Basement, Weeks Hall\nStanding Room Only - CAG Soup Run 8pm DaVinci's Bar 7pm Basement, Weeks Il all Caving Ciub MeetingSouthside Lounge 9pm CLAYPONDS CINEMA\nTRIPTO EALING BROADWAY contact\nian.doyle@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

When they're not\ninstalling anal probes into cartoon characters or popping down the universe\nfor a late night snack they're infecting the\nworld with deadly red viruses and performing major\narchitectural\nchanges to major\ncities.\nThis game is\nno exception with\nsome dirty, low\ndown aliens having invaded the\ncity of Arcadia and\ngenerally gone about clearing the rabble\nof humans in a way that certain Balkan\nleaders would feel was truly justified.\nThis time thc UN have sat this one out\nand instead you get he a vii y armoured\ntroopers - Mr Washington or Ms Doyle,\nwho arc perfectly capable of dealing\nwith this sort of thing themselves.\nDropped into the city it is their job to\nhunt down any alien transport by run-ning, jumping, picking up power ups and\nmowing down any aliens with the\nimpressive amount of firepower at your\ndisposal.\n\u2022\u00ab=\u2022 rn \u2022\u00ab\u00bb\u2022\u00ab\nmmm iW Mm sm The Unholy war\nEidos \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYes it's thc return of the 3rd person\nshoot-em-up usually well done by the\narcades but poorly executed on the con-soles. Forget strategy, the aim of this\ngame is to keep the gun red hot and\nAlien blood flowing. The graphics and\nthe lighting effects set the scene as the\nrollercoaster of destruction flows from\nexplosion to explosion. The arcade\nflavour is strengthened as the rumble\neffects from the Dual Shock gamepad\nadd to the experience. If Sony did want\na game to show the playstation as an\narcade emulator this would make it into\nthe top 5. An excellent blast and kill\ngame that you might well find difficult to\nstop playing.\nGS\nKelly Doyle and Reno Washington take\ntime out to admire their new 80's style\nshoulder pad set.\nNews\nMichael Owen in Bed\nwith Lara.\nNow thc World Cup is a distant memory\nof diss a point m cnt, it's time for the usual\nseasonal releases to surface above the\ndug out. Not the first out but closely\nshadowing ISS is Eidos Interactive's little\nMichael Owen's World League Soccer\n'99.

Peter Brackley and Ray\nWilkins are the other big names pulled\nin to hurl abuse whenever the ball diss-a pears into row Q. Kick off is on the 20th November at the usual PC and Playstation grounds throughout the country.\nWe will be running a competition for a lucky Playstation owner to get a free\ncopy later this month.\nPark Life :\nPC Screensaver Alert\nSouth Park is officially big. It's bigger\nthan Cartman on bulking agent. Now\nthose nice people from Telstar are about\nto release a plague of epidemic proportions with the forthcoming release of the\nSouth Patk PC theme and Screensaver.\nThis handy little package also contains a calendar allowing you to have a character of the day, as well as providing\nicons and wallpapers from South Park\nscenes. So after Xmas expect PC's though out the world to echo to the cries\nof \"Kick Ass\", \"Ftowdcc Ho 1\n\" and \"Oh my\nGod I They've killed Kenny\". It's due out\non the 13th of November - remember\n1.5 million viewers a week on Channel\n4 can't be wrong !\nIs it a beat-em-up? Is it a strategy game? Is it a role playing game? Well,\nyes, it is all three and its\npretty good at most of\nthem too. Once again\nalien invasion is the\ncause of it all as the\nceasefire between the\nnative Arcanes and the\nnewcomer Tecknos has\nbroken and all that is left\nis for one race to drive\nthc other into oblivion.\nAll that you have to do is\nchoose whether you\nwant to do so in a simple arena driven beat-em-up, or prolong the\nanticipation by playing a strategy game\nbased on a3D map, moving your characters and fighting it out when you meet\nthe enemy on the same grid tile.\nAs a beat-em-up it doesn't really\nmatch the aggression of say the Tekken\nrelease as close in combat can generally\nbe avoided. This is where a bit of the\nstrategy element seeps into the straight\nfight as each of thc characters have their\nown specialities. Some of them were\nnever built for the rough and tumble of\nbar fighting and prefer throwing items\nand running. These little cowards can get\nreally annoying when your opponent\nrealises that your rhino is little quicker\nthan a C5 at full speed. Choose wisely,\ncorner the buggers and they will soon\nstop their anti-social ways. The animation\nshould you get close in though is as\nsharp as a pair of speeding shears\nthough silk, with thc camera managing\nto capture most of it without zipping\nabout too much.\nAs a strategy cum role playing game\nit once again loses out against some of\nthe more specialist games. It is not chess\nand does not have the sophistication\nand range of moves of similar strategy\ngames. It is really a modern, well executed and animated 3-D version of thc\nclassic 1980's2D strategy game Archon.\nInstead of the Dark and fight you have\ntwo tribes, but both allow the characters\nto cast spells between turns and fight\nover the grid tiles.\nIf you do fancy something to engage both\nyour primal and in tc lcc tu al parts this could be it.\nfive minutes to spare and\nyou can practice your special moves. Got an hour\nor two to spare and you\ncan pretend you are\nbeing intel cc tu al while\nspilling blood in thc\narena. It is effectively two\nabove average games for\nthe price of one.\nGS\nHarvest for the World\nGremlin's time traveling alien\nshooter Body harvest has finally been\nreleased. Your genetically enhanced\nhero has to battle through five different\nlevels of alien incursion in order to prevent the human race from meeting a messy end as as cries of late night take-aways.\nChoose to run about the level or if\nyou can't be bothered to run about like\na headless chicken you can take vehicles\nwithout consent and drive about the\nun congest cd streets. Progress to thc\nnext level by saving locals and blowing\nup the shield generators, and allowing\nthe rest of the world to become involved\nin the fight - The aliens arc basically\nsouthern universe shandy drinkers.\nTalking to some of the locals will\nalso be useful as they provide hints and\nand tell you where the super hidden\nspecial weapons are kept. Use these\nand you can go on killing aliens in drive\nby shootings. It looks good and popped\ninto ex is lance at all time consist ant software shops last Friday.\n\n"

If we did 'correct'\nletters it would be difficult to know when\nto stop, especially when we honestly\narc unsure as to the nature of the point\nbeing made.

This week I'm bringing ya the lowdown on the most recent single releases.\nLet's get straight to it, we start off with Incredible\nfrom Mr Mostbeautifulest Keith Murray and featuring\nLL Cool J. This is the first track to be taken off his - soon\nto come - third album, but if you're expecting the boy\nto come over for promotion chores, think again, he's been banged up and we probably won't see him till well\ninto the next century. As for Incredible it's good, not\nquite incredible, but definitely worth a check if you\nhaven't heard it yet. LL and Keith combine well over\nsome steady beats.\nNext up we look at the least talented of The Fugees\n- Pras - and his new single Blue Angels coming off his\nsolo album Ghetto Superstar. After the huge success of\nGhetto Superstar featuring Mya, this is bound to get into\nthe charts first week out, it's already been getting\nhe aw airplay on the pop radio stations. Only thing is\nthat it's shit, besides a pretty catchy chorus its got\nnothing going for it, Ptas fills thc spaces with his usual\nrambling over a sample from Grease, but it all ends up\nas shit. Pras could only get worse if he was to sample\nABBA guess what? Rumour has it he's done a little number around ABBA's Dancing Queen fucking hell!!!\nMoving swiftly on to something else we got the UK\nrelease of the tune of the year, you gotta know what\nI'm talking about, I mention it every week Love\nLike This from Faith Evans. This is a dancefloor monster\nthat has been blowing up since the start of thc year and\nat last gets a UK release, you know the score Buy\nit.\nThe Darkchild (Rodneyjerkins) brings us a banging\nremix of Brandy's last offering Top of the World, with\nFat Joe and Big Pun on rap duty. This one is perfect for\nthe car, rolling down the road with a light funked up\nbeat pumping out the back, beautiful.\nBritish is back, Sista Sista from Beverly Knight, this\nyoung lady has been blazing a way with her second set\nProdigal Sista and this is the third track to be lifted from\nit following on the wicked Made It Back and classy\nRewind. The album mix is laid back with some really\nimpressive vocals laid over the top, although not up to\nthe standard of thc first two it's still good.\nStill with thc British skills we got Another Level\nwith Guess I Was a Fool, this is more than an adequate\nfollow up to the excellent Freak Me. Guess I Was., is a dreamy slow jam that has confirmed these guys as the\ntop boy band. Watch out for their latest number featuring Shola Ama (tune) and their album still to drop.\nBut those guys better get ready for my boys - Nine\nYards, these boys hail from Peckham (so you know I gotta represent for them). They were signed up to Virgin in a second because Daze, Step and Flake (their\nnames fucked up? ....yep) look the part and most\ncertainly sound the part. They've just dropped their first\nsingle Loneliness Is Gone, a chunky debut that should\ndo well and will follow it up with their album Where Do\nWe Go From Here?, should go straight to the top.\nThe shiny headed one, R Kelly, comes at us with the\nsecond bomb from his long play set, the single Home\nAlone featuring Keith 'banged up in jail (and gonna be\nbanged up in jail)' Murray. This a wickedly infectious\ntune that has got to be a hit, it's funky, it's uptempo,\ngot a bad as s beat and it's gonna be a monster. The long\nplayer R. has been acclaimed as the best album to come\nfrom the man, it holds the hits / Believe I Can Fly, Half\nOn A Baby, Home Alone and Gotham City as well as\nnew shit featuring Foxy, Kelly Price, Nas, Jay Z and\nmany more. A double album that's definitely worth a check.\nSome two years after his death Tupac is still releasing tracks and this week sees the release of Happy\nIK Home, this was recorded while at Death Row and is surprisingly good. The single is apparently acting as a taster for the new forthcoming album You Never Heard.\nDeath Row are said to still have numerous tracks under\nlock and key in the vaults, but I'm hoping they put the\nbest ones out now, although they're probably gonna\nhoard 'em.\nMaxwell released his sophomore set just before the\nsummer break up and I rushed out to spend my cash,\nonly to be disappointed, I was expecting something that\ncould at least sit on the same rack as Urban Hang Suite\ninstead I found Fmbrya. Now don't get me wrong\nEmbrya is good, but its not on the same level as his\ndebut set and apparently many agreed with me\nbecause its sales were well down on the projections.\nStaying with Maxwell, he recently cancelled his concert\ndates In the States, thc official line is cos of personal\nproblems, initially people said this was a front and it was\nactually because of the poor sales. Now though rumour\nhas it thc soul man has suffered a mental breakdown because of sales? Hope not.\nSee ya.\nMilen\nNine yards coming at ya, all the way from Peckham hair done at Desmonds? I think so!\nPhat Selection\nDevils Pie - D 'Angelo\nRAW, DJ Premier lays clown the\nbeats for soul maestro D 'Angelo to\ndo his stuff to devastating effect.\nKeep The Faith - Faith Evans\nTune of the year came first, now\nwe have album for the year. God\ndamn!\nLoneliness Is Gone - Nine Yards\nThe new boyz on the block kick it\noff with a stunning debut single.\nSweetheart-JD feat. Mariah\nMariah looking fine.\n\n"

    "content": "16 November 1998 Sport & Clubs 25\nSailing\nHaving proved that wc were thc best of\nthe rest by winning the silver fleet trophy\nat the six-pack the weekend before, it\nwas time to go and play with the big\nboys (and girls) at the Student National\nSailing championships in Plymouth. With\nthe Met Office bringing out the special\ntop-draw big red arrows for thc week-end's weather forecast, nerves were\nfrayed on the way down. Despite Lateboy pulling both of his usual tricks, and\nVerge-girl causing traffic chaos, we managed to get to our Plymouth digs in\nplenty of time to get locked in the bar.\nNice.\nSaturday dawned far too soon, but\nnice and breezy. With a force 4-5 coming in across the bay and the forecast\nbeing for force 8 gusting 9 later in the\nday our hosts decided to sail only one\nfleet at a time, a good move considering the carnage that resulted form this\nsort of weather last year. The Lark fleet\nwas out last, giving us plenty of time to\nsort boats and drink tea. finally wc were\noff in the early afternoon with Tony muttering 'I'm not going home in a Plymouth Ambulance'. Andy+Tony secured\nthemselves a good start position only to\nbe foiled by fickle fate as a mechanical\nfailure put them out before the gun\nwent. Chris*2 and Alex+Simon took up\nthc challenge and stormed round virtually neck and neck, until the kites went\nup and Chris*2 went swimming.\nAlex+Simon decided to stay dry and\nstormed round thc course to finish a superb second, demonstrating to the\nrest of the fleet behind them who did-n't have the balls to get the kite up how\nit should be done.\nSunday started sunny with the forecast gales being replaced by a light\nbreeze. Tony was left high and dry for\nthe first race, as Andy couldn't be bothered to get out of Nicky's bed - and to\nbe frank who can blame him?\nSimon+Alex mixed it up at the top of the\nfleet again to prove that Saturday's result\nwas no fluke and Tim+Bean got a top\ntwenty finish that was cheekier than\nmost people realised. Race two and\nAndy+Tony finally manage to storm over\nthe start line and lead for part of thc first\nleg. The fleet catch-up during thc beat,\nbut Andy+Tony hold it together down\nthe run as Tim+Bean stomp over the\nfleet and Simon+Alcx stealth their way\nthrough to another good result. With\ntwo boats finishing in the top ten IC\nwent into the final race with plenty to\nplay for. The heavily port biased start line\nfor the final race, coupled with the outgoing tide meant that most of the fleet\nwas over the line when the gun went.\nFollowing the general recall IC mixed it\nat thc top again, with Andy+Tony doing\nwell until they got trounced up the second beat, Bean+Tim wishing they had a thermos of tea with them and\nSimon+Alex consolidating their position\nnear the top. Top ten finishes from\nBean+Tim plus Simon+Alex rounded off\nthc days sailing nicely. Congratulations\nto Simon+Alex who finished fourth overall in a fleet containing many world class\nsailors and were the top University\nowned boat, with only the span gly privateers boats ahead of them. Chris*2,\nAndy+Tony and Tim+Bean all put in consistently good results demonstrating the\ndepth of strength in thc IC Sailing Team.\nFellwanderers\nSeventeen Fcllwanderers set off for the\nBrecon Beacons on Friday evening,\nundeterred by a dod gy van. The gearbox\nwas back-to-front, the hand brake was\non the right and it had all the acceleration of an elderly hippopotamus on tranquil is crs. The police were patrolling\nPrince Consort Road in preparation for\nthe Remembrance Day festival, so we\nparked the van outside the Union hoping they would tow it away. But sadly\nthey ignored us, obviously on the\nassumption that\nanyone choosing to drive\nsuch a vehicle\nmust be too stupid to pose a threat to\nnational security. So wc had\nto drive thc\nbloody thing all\nthe way to\nSouth Wales.\nWe made it in\nthe end, and there was just time for a cup of tea before bed.\nThere was no messing around on\nSaturday. Everyone was up bright and\nearly, with much enthusiasm for a monster hike up Pen y fan and on to Fan y Big (the name alone was enough incentive for some of our more easily pleased\nmembers). So we breakfasted quickly\n\u2022 and were soon on our way up thc flank\nof Pen y Fan. Morale remained high\ndespite steep climbs, howling gales and\nrelentless Fan y Big jokes, and we were\nsoon up high, admiring thc impressive\nUltimate Frisbee\nNo score given (IC lost)\nOn Sunday 8th the IC Ultimate Club\nplayed its first ever game. For those of\nyou who are not already familiar with this\nexcellent sport, here is a quick ex plan a tion: Like American Football crossed with\nNetball, played with a plate-like plastic\ndisc most people would call a Frisbee.\nReally you just chuck a Frisbee around\nand do a lot of running.\nWe were playing away to the\nSouthampton Skunks, and the coach\nwas leaving at 10:00am. jon said 10:00,\nI didn't know. At 8:00 my alarm went, so\nI got up to turn it off and sat and played\nTekken for a while, Jon emerged from his\nroom, and we slowly got ready. Ket was\nup too, 'cos he had a snooker match in\nSouthampton, it was a rare sight. At 8:41\nKet suggested I checked the departure\ntime, so I called Tom on his mobile.\n\"Aright\" says me, '\"Ello\" say Tom. I check\nthe meeting time, \"8:30. coach leaves at\n9\" says Tom, then \"Where are ya?\".\nJon and I ran to thc station, bought\ntube tickets at 8:48, no train on the plat-form. Shit. A short taxi ride later and we\nwere at the Victoria coach thing, sitting\nin a coach with 15 other Frisbee chaps.\nTwo and a half hours later (or maybe\nthree, I dunno) wc arrived in Southampton, first stop was Burger King, where wc\nfuelled up on burgers and shite food like\nthat (well, some of us did). Then it was\noff to the Common for a bit of practise\nbefore 'The Game'. The Common was-n't such a definitive meet.

Since we didn't have a captain (as such) I thanked them for the\ngames etc.\n\"To the pub!\" they cried, and off we\nwent. An hour or so later we had to get\ngoing, cos thc coach was returning, and\nthen we were heading back.\nOn the way back the main topic of\nconversation (apart from how goddamn\ngood we were) was what the team\nname should be.

    "content": "14 The Electric Cafe 16 November 1998 16 November 1998 The Electric Cafe 15\nIn the last eight\n4 years Richie Havvtin\njj has produced some of\nthe most intriguing\ntechno from the\nDetroit area. He uses a variety of guises\nto release his music Fuse, Concept and\nmost famously Plastikman. As a DJ, his\nstatus is world-reno und. With the release\nof the third in the trilogy of Plastikman\nalbums (Artifakts), the Electric Cafe\ncaught up with the man behind the\nmusic.\nWho are you? What do you?\nI look at myself as being some sort\nof electronic musician, also a DJ. I 've\nbeen creating electronic music since\n1990 and doing a lot of travelling and\nDJing. But really what I'm doing is Just\nproducing and playing music that really\ngrabbed me in the late 1980's. So you're making a continuation of\nthat music?\nSort of a continuation. I'm not\nsomeone who sat down and decided to\nbe a musician or an entertainer or anything like that. I was just going along,\ngoing to school studying film and video.\nNothing to do with music. Then along\ncame electronic music,- Detroit techno,\nChicago acid house music and like a truck hit me over the head and the next\nthing kind of engulfed my life, and nine\nyears later here I am talking about it still.\nTell us about how you would play In\na club, normally. What are you looking to\nachieve when you are DJing?\nA lot of DJs think their main goal is\nto make people dance. That's something\nthat is important to me but I think I'm more interested in giving people something a little bit different. Of course I keep\nthat in the back of my head, 'yes I'm here\nin a club atmosphere to make these\npeople dance', but I don't want to give\npeople exactly what they want or make\nit easy for them. I want to give them\nsome twists and turns. If the crowd is into\nharder-edge techno I want to give them\nsome of that but something else that\nmaybe they think they don't like or\nmaybe it's just that they never really\nheard it played well or heard the right\nmusic before. So everytime I play,-whether it's a mix for home, or in a club\nor for a big festival It's more an experiment and exploration in front of people,\nand hopefully there's some type of reaction between you and them and you go\nsomewhere with it.\nSo it's a form of communication?\nYes. I think any good DJ is someone\nwho communicates and with all communication it must go there and back. It\ncan't be one-way flow. I guess when\nyou're DJing you could just get up there\nand hammer your point down to people.\nBut to make your point, whether as a DJ,\nor a verbal communicator or a writer\nyou have to take into considerations the\nfeedback and use that feedback to\nunderstand how to get your point across.\nSo what feedback do you get back\nand use to read the crowd?\nIt's the people, the atmosphere,\neven the space you're in. Certain things\nseem to work better in confining areas\nrather than big areas. You can see people really start to get into things and you\nknow that you can continue on with\nthat. If sometimes people stop dancing\nthat also can be good feedback, because\nmaybe you've gone too far one way but\nmaybe also people are thinking 'this is\ndifferent'. And if they start to react again\nWindsor, Canada. From my house to\ndowntown Detroit is five minutes, just\ncrossing a river. It's like north and south\nLondon. So a lot of the radio airwaves we\nget are from Detroit. In the late 1980's there were a number of key players in\nthe area. There was a guy called the\nElectrifying Mojo. There was also a guy\nwho everyone knows now in the techno\n\"People are trying to\ncreate a much more\npurer form of music\none person can\nget his message\ndirectly across to a lot\nof people.\"\nor walk away, you have to take all these\nthings into consideration. With anything\nyou want to take people through different experiences. You don't want to give\nthem 4/4 techno all night. You don't want to give them house music all night.\nYou want to take them to different places\nand sometimes to the brink of exhaustion or boredom, and then take them\nsomewhere else. It's always about using\nthe reaction back from them but keeping one step ahead of them.\nHow did you get Into this music?\nThe main reason was radio. I live in\narena whose name is Jeff Mills. I le used\nto go under the name the Wizard. On\nthese shows each of these guys was\nplaying a crazy mixture of new music.\nEverything from a Chicago acid house\ntrack to a German industrial track to a B52's track, then to some hip-hop, then\nto some Detroit techno music. Just new\nmusic. I remember tuning into it and it\nwas exciting. You were always hearing\nnew things, things you hadn't heard\nbefore, things twisting. To mc it was the\nfirst time that I really got into music. It was\nas if this was what I had been waiting for\nand it grabbed me and pulled me right\nin.\nYou talk as if all your musical history\nstarted at this point. Do you think that\nthings from before came Into It?\nIt wasn't as sudden as it sounded.\nAlso in the early 1980'sI was getting\ninto other things. I was into other music\nlike New Order, some early electro\nmusic. A lot of my friends were into\nmusic at early grade school, but music\nnever really interested mc, and then as\nI started to get exposure to some of this\nelectronic stuff, even in a pop format like\nErasure or Yazz, then I started to think\n'this is really cool'. That's when I really\nstarted to like music. But it wasn't until\nJeff's show when I heard these stripped-down acidic techno tracks especially a lot\nof them from Detroit that I was really\ngrabbed. That was when it all made\nsense and get serious. In the sense that\neverything got even more exciting.\nWhat do you think it Is about this\nmusic that grabbed you? Was it because\nit was electronic and new? Or what the\nearly artists were saying with their work?\nPartly it was what they weren't say-ing. I liked the fact that it was stripped\ndown to the bare minimum, not in a min-i mali stic way, but that it was very pure. I liked the idea that there wasn't the typical verbal communication as in vocals.\nSo each person could take something\nout of it, personally. There was still a feeling there, but it wasn't preaching to\nyou and that was something that I did-n't find attractive in other music. Also the\nfuturistic part of it. The part that when you\nturn the radio on or put the needle down\non the record , you were basically getting\ninto this world where you had never\nbeen before. It was always a new sound.\nIt's basically the only sound that can be\na futuristic music This is music that even\nif you don't like or understand it, is created by technology. There is a human\nelement in there of course, but anything\nthat is created with technology moves\nalong with technology. And technology\nis one of the fastest moving things on\nthis planet. Something that you can only\nimagine today will be created tomorrow,\nand along with that the sound you can\nimagine in your head today that you\ncan't create today will probably be possible tomorrow.\nDo you think this music actually is\ntechnology or is it a way of conveying\ntechnology?\nMaybe it's more of amish mash of\ntechnology! Technology has always represented the future to man. It represents\na better tomorrow, to make our lives\nbetter, to make us happier, to improve\nthe planet we live on. Maybe in that\nway, it is apparent in the music. People\nare trying to create a much more purer\nform of music than has ever been created. Classically there were always bands\nor symphonies. There were always multiple players. This is the first type of music\nthat you can really do intricate melodies\nand layouts and scores, but by one per-son. So even in that way it's become very\npure, that one person can get his message directly across to a lot of people.\nYou talk in terms of technology. Lots\nof people talk of music In terms of this\nirrational art form that doesn't make logical sense. How do you see this dual\nthing?\nWell, if the machines were making\nthe music themselves then it would be\nmore of a black and white thing; a zero\nand one digital nonsense! But man is creating this technology so there is part of\nhim in it already, no matter how mechanical it gets. The technology still needs\nsome type of human intervention to get\nsomething out of it. It's not automatic.\nYou don't press a button and something\ncomes out. And so that's the unknown\nfactor. Each person is different, each person uses a piece of equipment differ-ent ly, each person has different ideas in\ntheir heads. So when you sit all these\npeople down with the same piece of\ntechnology they're all going to pull something completely different out of those\nboxes. That is where the extra colours in\nthe palette come from.\nIn your Introduction to the music,\nyou said you were listening to radio\nshows. What happened from there?\nAfter listening to these DJs on the\nradio I started to heavily collect a lot of\nthese records, just for my personal col-lect ion. I liked to play them at home.\nBecause a lot of this music was dance\nmusic I had a lot of friends who started\nto get into it, and we came to a problem.\nThere was a lot of clubs in Detroit that\nyou could go to to hear the music. But\nin Windsor, where I was from there really\nwasn't anything. Basically my friends and\nI got together to throw some sort of\nparty. We didn't really know what we\nwere doing. We just wanted to play the\nmusic loud so we could have some sort\nof dance. The only problem with that was\na disused club, in the sense that there\nwas no one going there, so it was a failing club. Instead of giving us a one night\nparty pass and letting us do whatever we\nwanted, the deal was that they wanted\nus to DJ every Friday night. I'd never\nbeen a DJ before. I didn't even know if\nI wanted to DJ every weekend, but I thought 'Let's go for it and see what\nhappens!' So it was really something I just\nfell into, probably similar to you. You\nlove this music, and you really want to\nget other people into it. And you want to\nmake sure that play the right things so\nthat people have the right conditions to\nsay, 'yes I like it' or 'no I don't like it'. You\nobviously don't want people saying, 'I hate techno!' when they've never really\nheard the right kind of track. So that was\nwhy we wanted to do it. We wanted to\ndance. We wanted to open up new people to this.\nSo when you started, could you mix?\nI was trying, but it wasn't very good.\nIt was amish mash of everything. I did-n't become a DJ to play crazy underground techno tracks that no one knew.\nIt was all over the board, but all very ele c tronic.\nAfter that we started to go to more\nclubs. We got fake ID to get inside clubs\nin Detroit. Again, I met the right people\nand ended up getting a DJ job at the\nShelter in downtown Detroit. That's really\nwhere it all started to happen for mc. It's where I met the other Detroit producers.\nI finally met Jeff who I'd been listening\nto on the radio. I met Derrick May and\npeople like that. It's where there was\nmore of a creative atmosphere. In 1987\nin Detroit there was a lot of producers\nmaking a lot of stuff. These were the\nyears where it really picked up in England\nand all these producers were starting to\ntravel and get recognition and record\ndeals. So that affected a lot of people.\nEveryone saw that and got more interested in DJing and maybe even taking a step up from DJing, in terms of making\ntheir own records. And that's what we\nthought of next.\nSo everything for you was just a shot\nin the dark. You didn't know whether it\nwould work but you just tried it.\nYeah. Isn't that what most people\ndo? If you put money into school you\ndon't know if you'll succeed or pass.\nYou've travelled the globe as a DJ.\nWhen you were talking earlier about\ninteraction and communication, is that\nuniversal in every country or does the\n'language' change as you travel?\nThere are slight variations from country to country, especially from the East to\nWest. There are differences in the crowd,\nbut only slight cultural differences. The\none thing that you have to remember\nabout this music is that because there are\nno vocals and it is very pure and in s tru mental, it can speak to many people at\nthe same time across many cultural differences. It doesn't matter about your\ncolour or what language you speak. It's really about the sounds and the feeling\nit gives you. As you travel, people might\ndance differently, they may line up a lit-\"A lot of DJs think their\nmain goal is to make\npeople dance -that's important to me but\nit's more an experiment and exploration\nin front of people.\"\ntie more concisely, but when it comes\ndown to it, the music is really hitting\nthese people, and you don't have to\nreally change it at all. If a certain track\nworks in one place, the feeling is usually\npicked up everywhere. In any other\nmusic, it doesn't really happen. Especially the typical pop format or music\nwith vocals. That's where everything\nbreaks down in communication. Even\npeople who understand different languages don't understand the nuances.\nYou can say different things in different\nways and reverse the words. With electronic music I really do find that most\nplaces do pick up on what's coming\nthrough on the track.\nWhy do you use so many different\npseudonyms to record your music?\nWhen I started out recording, the\npseudonyms gave a sense of being\nbehind the scenes a bit more. When we\ntalk about the purity of electronic music,\nanother part of the purity, especially at\nthe beginning, is that there wasn't really\nnames or faces out there. It wasn't so\nmuch about the personalities, and it still\nisn't. It's more about concepts and ideas,\nthan with a lot of other forms of music.\nThe pseudonyms enabled me to release\na lot of records in a short space of time,\nwith slightly different ideas. Each music\ncoloured things differently, and enabled\nmc to step back and let the records do\nthe talking. It's nearly like a sonic form of\ncommunication, and enabled mc to\nmove faster.\nArtists who use pseudonyms release\ndifferent types of music under each separate identity. Do you do that too?\nYeah. The Plastikman definitely has\na certain sense about it. A certain atmosphere. That's something I try to stick to\nwhen I do that. I recorded under some\nother names, Fuse which I did some\nyears ago, Circuit Breaker. They all had\ntheir purpose I guess.\nAre they all different parts of your\npsyche?\nEveryone has so many different\npieces to themselves. We're all like these\njigsaw puzzles, and really only your closest friends know a bigger portion of\nthose. But I don't think anybody truly\nknows what makes you up except for\nyourself. And so with electronic music I think people are able to show a lot of different versions of those pieces. As those\npieces start to come up through the\nequipment and the moods of the producer they start to get different sounds\nand perhaps different ideas. So I think it\nis an interesting idea to have different\nsounds or different tags on those different moods. It's nearly like you're pre-sort-ing what you're doing.\nWhen I see photos of you as the Plastikman, it's always a very strange atmosphere. The eyes and the glasses are\ncentral. It's quite serious, but in a way\nwhacky. Do you feel with each pseudonym like an actor slipping into a part?\n(continued in Clubscene)\n\n"

    "content": "4\nLetters 16 November 1998\nA Final Word on Medics?\nMr Editor,\nI am writing both to clarify a couple of\ninaccuracies in your editorial of 9th November, and make an additional\npoint, or two.\nFirstly, as regards the content of my\nearlier letter, in the build up to my writing it, I stood in front of the whole year\ngroup and stated that I was going to\nwrite a letter to Felix expressing my displeasure at recent Felix articles, and the\nfollowing day, I again stood up and\naddressed the year group, specifically\nstating that no one should feel under any\npressure to sign it and that they should\nonly do so if they wanted to; in addition,\nmultiple copies were available in the lecture theatre for people to read, but unfortunately as these were hogged and\ndefaced by one of your journalists, Claire\nAshwin, and her associates, it is of no surprise that not as many people got to read\nthem as should have.\nSecondly, I was pleasantly surprised\nby the attitude taken by many of the stu-dents, who after reading the letter in\nFelix expressed their support, but their\nknowledge of the exact details was\nimpeded by reasons stated earlier, so\nplease bear in mind the fact that over\n60% of the 2nd at Charing Cross signed\nthis, we are not to be ignored.\nThirdly, my initial letter was handed\nin with about 110 signatures so could you\nplease find out what happened to the\nothers. [I have no idea-we typed In all\nthose we had at the time, but a page\nmay have gone missing. Sorry. - Ed]\nFinally, there is nothing in my letter\nthat insinuated an active intention to\nstop integration, and this can be safely\nassumed to be the case with at least 60%\nof medical students as my letter's supporters show. My last paragraph stated\nthat it is In everyone's interest that we get\nalong, and as such, I will try in anyway to\nensure a harmonious existence between\nmedics and non medics regardless of\nwhat you or anyone else may think.\nMr Osa Emohare\nDear Felix,\nI am a first year medic and I have to side\nwith the editor on this one. You have to\nfeel sorry for the first year as we seem to\nbe rejected by all of IC. It's no wonder\nthat medics form a tight community if\nonly for defence.\nThe real problem that we face is the\nrivalry between Mary's and CX students\nas we belong to neither. Medics nights\nout usually turn into a \"who can shout the\nname of their medical school loudest\ncom pet ion!\" We are just left stood about\nlooking bewildered as to where to put\nourselves.\nIC need to think that if all they are\ngoing to do is give medics abuse then\nmedics aren't going to want to Integrate\nwith them and the older medics need to\nrealise that they are part of IC too and all\na merger does is to broaden the t radi tons of the medical schools and not to take\nthem away.\nCan we stop the torrents of abuse\ngoing in both directions now?\nJoe\nDear Felix\nI must come clean. Your editorial in\nissue 1125 was right - certainly with\nregard to me. The first time I read the\nletter from Osa Emohare which I had\n'signed' was in the pages of Felix a week\nlater. Obviously this only reflects badly\non me and not at all on Osa.\nThe first year medics have the opportunity to enjoy belonging at IC, and to\ntheir credit they do so. For second year\nmedics who live and work mainly in\nHammersmith, it was never practical for\nus to make Southside or the Union our\nhome when the Reynolds Bar at CX is so\nmuch closer (and cheaper).\nWe said goodbye to Charing Cross\nlast year at our now infamous ball and\nour future lies with Imperial - what I wanted to say by signing Osa's letter\nwas: We're not here very often so when\nwe do come, please be nice to us!\nYours\nTom Evens (2nd Year Charing Cross)\nDear Felix,\nI seek what is best for the students who\nelected me, but also try to make sure that\nwe integrate with IC. Thc latter is a difficult process, as the old guard see what\nwere vibrant and friendly campuses,\nslowly loosing their immense history to\na building that they never use. Therefore\nsome animosity sometimes is miss-directed at IC, but at no time whatsoever\nhas this become a public display.\nAs for the accusation of arrogance\nform the medics; this is mistaken jubilation at achieving a life's ambition. Thc\ndifference between medicine and many\ncourses is that you become part of a profession from the day you start.\nNo medic would honestly say to a fresher not to social is e with non-medics.\nThey are living together and so should\nlearn form one another, and at the same\ntime keep the passion alive in the medical\nschool, so that we can once again raise\nover \u00a340,000 for charity, put on amazing\nproductions, and achieve the highest\nsporting accolades. I hope that people will\nforgive the medics for such passion and\nnot mistake it for arrogance, maybe we\ncan instil such passion in IC one day?????\nMr.Karan Kapoor\nSocial Secretary ICSM\nDear Felix,\nI wish to apologise for the factual inaccuracies of my article in Felix 1122. What\nI wrote was true to thc best of my knowledge at the time -1 thank Nick Carter for\nthe correction of my errors.\nI have nothing against medics.\nIndeed, I have several friends who study\nmedicine and I have a great deal of\nrespect for the profession.\nThe only campaign that seems to\nhave taken place is Mr Emohare's quest\nto find every article published in Felix with\nany reference to IC medics and to blindly\npick fault with it.\nIn addition, I find his accusations of\nracism against my colleague completely\nunfounded and, quite frankly, libelous (if\nyou ask me).\nI hope that this is the end of the mat-ter.\nAndrew Brown\nFelix news team\nBeware of Culls\nDear Felix,\nI am writing to draw your readers' attention to a big problem faced by universi-ties: Cults. There is no strict definition in\nlaw of a cult, but it is helpful to think of\na cult as any organisation that attempts\nto practice some form of mind control\nover their members or extort money\nfrom them. They don't all match the\nstereotype of grinning madmen in flowing robes some can be very organised,\neffective and above all subtle.\nWe have information that several\ngroups are active in fond on, targeting\nuniversities, specifically fresher s. We cannot name any specific groups (for legal\nreasons), but if anyone has been\napproached by someone they think is\nsuspicious, then we urge them to check\nit out before signing up to anything - in\nthe first instance they can contact the\nUnion Welfare officer, Rene Frank\n(rene.frank@ic.ac.uk), or myself\n(sl mon. lewis@Ic.ac.uk) with their con-cern s. There is also a National Cult Hotline (01 689-833800) and a website which\ncan offer advice. Remember: If in doubt,\njust don't get involved.\nYours truly,\nSimon Lewis\nICU Equal Opportunities Officer\nComic Comeback\nDear Felix,\nConcerning the centre fold cartoons that\nyou have published in the past weeks:\nThese two master pieces of ugliness and\nvulgarity have greatly offended our sen-sibi li ties. I low anybody could find this\namusing is beyond human understand-ing. We therefore request a public apology from thc cartoonist, and their\nimmediate expulsion from Felix.\nYours sincerely.\nFlat 2B, Pembridge Gardens.\nDear Ed,\nHaving read thc contentious cartoon in\nFelix 1122,1 would like to add my support\nto the undoubtedly tai en ted cartoonist. As\na woman, I can see nothing offensive in\nthe cartoon, except towards men. The\nhumour is fairly puerile, but the main character is a sad Individual who fortunately\nwon't get the chance to reproduce.\nIt's important not to confuse something you find offensive with something\nyou find boring, and despite the evident\nskill, the cartoon is unfunny. I can only\nhope that the subsequent cartoons will\nbe funnier and equally well drawn.\nYours sincerely,\nMs Julia Harries\nFormer Arts Editor & now School Teacher\nErroneous Editing\nDear Felix,\nI would like to complain about your policy of letter editing. Apparently, letters\nare edited for length but 'not... in any\nother way'. It seems to me to be most\nunfair to leave obvious grammatical and\nspelling mistakes un corrected, as this\npolicy can only discriminate against those\nfor whom English is not a first language\n(and against those who can't type..!)\nOn several occasions, both this year\nand last, a writer's point has been\nobscured by what are obviously accidental typographical s. When left un corrected these annoy readers and\nundermine the intellectual position of the\nwriter by showing his/her writing skills to\nbe inferior to those of the editor; who,\nafter all, is a full-time journalist working\nwith all the benefits of spell checks and\nproof-reading.\nI find this particularly relevant in\ncases where the writer is opposed to a position held by the editor; eg. last\nweek's letter from the medics that was\ncritical of Felix.\nYours\nMark, Physics IV\nLetters deadline is noon Wed\nLetters may be edited for length, but\nwill not be altered in any other way.\nLetters need not be signed, but a swipe card must be shown when submitting anonymous letters.\n\n"

Following a tough examination at St Mary's on Wednesday 4\nnovember {Felix\n1125), where\namongst other\nthings he confessed that he\nhad decided to Stuart Cook before his\nrun because he was \"a bit bored\" , a 'New Election' victory seemed likely.\nHowever, David Hellard, ICU President,\nstressed that\nthere should be\nno speculation\nabout the possible outcome as\nno counting took\nplace: all of the\nballot papers\nwere destroyed\nimmediately.\nAmong the\nconsequences of\nMr Cook's late\nwithdrawal from\nthe election is a not insignificant\nfinancial loss. His\ndecision to stand\ndown in effect\ndemise Photo: Joel after thc dec.t ions had been run has cost the Union\nan estimated \u00a3600 for the hire of ballot\nboxes, manning polling stations and\ntransport etc).\nWith thc sabbatical post still open,\nthe elections process will be forced to run\nits course once again. Nominations for\nthe position will be re-opened today,\nand will remain open for two weeks. If\na fully seconded candidate has been\nfound by this date, then campaigning\ncan begin, and another election will take\nplace shortly before Christmas. Consequently any successful candidate would\nassume the post at the end of this term\n- hardly a convenient time for most\nundergraduates, who would be put out\nof sync with the academic year.\nAs a result, David Hellard is \"not optimistic\" that a DP(C&S) will be found for\nthis year. If that is the case, then thc\nduties of DP(C&S) arc likely to be split\nbetween Messrs Hellard and Ince,\nadding to their already heavy workload.\nThc ICU President regretted that the\nUnion had lost \"a lot of time and effort\n- time and effort that could have been\nspent on more productive challenges.\nBut at least he had a go.\"\nMedics reel from resignations\nThe chaos that has hit the Constituent\nCollege Unions this year would seem to\nbe spreading, with the resignation of\none of the IC School of Medicine Union\n(ICSMSU) Vice Presidents leaving serious questions hanging over the Union.\nThe resignation of Seif Ahmad, the\nICSMSU Vice-President (Internal) at Charing Cross, comes on top of Andy Hceps'\ndecision to stand down as ICSMSU Secretary two weeks ago and continuing\nsuggestions of unhappiness amongst\nmembers of the Medical School Executive. Various reasons for the two resignations have been put forward by senior\nsources, but thc common thread of problems caused by the on-going merger\nbetween Charing Cross and St Mary's runs through them all.\nWade Gayed, the ICSMSU President,\naccepted this problem \"Last year there\nwas as abb at each site, and the students\nwere used to a large union all under one\nroof. Now we're spread across three\ncampuses\". This, he said, had led to a level of apathy amongst Charing Cross\nBy David Roberts\nstudents that had been seen as unacceptable by certain elements who had\n\"used it as cannon fodder against Seif\".\nConsequently, Mr Gaycd felt that he had been forced out by certain elements at\nCharing Cross - both students and staff.\nHowever, a more worrying side\neffect of the pressures created by the\nmerger has been a growing personal\nanimosity that has developed amongst\nvarious senior members of the Med\nSchool Exec. IC Union President David\nHellard explained that \"tensions were\nrunning high, causing splits to occur\",\nand Mr Gayed backed up this opinion,\nnoting that \"members of the Union definitely weren't happy with each other...\nfor the last few weeks our Exec meetings\nhave just been s lagging matches\". It is\nthese divisions which have been\nrumoured to be the real cause behind Mr\nAhmad's resignation. Indeed, Mr Gayed\nwent on to say that \"the pressure was far\nmore than we imagined when we took\nthe job on ... I 've thought about resigning several times\".\nCertainly Mr Heeps' resignation was\nrelated to the problems faced by the\nUnion, with Mr Gayed accepting that\nthe cause of thc resignation was that\n\"Andy didn't want to be a part of a Union\nthat was failing\". Whilst he accepted that\nthis was true two weeks ago, he added\nthat thanks to the work done in the intervening time \"the Union is finally getting\nits act together, so stay tuned\".\nInside..\nLetters 4\nEditorial 5\nColumns 6\nFeature 8\nMusic W Music Feature 14\nClubscene 16\nFilm 18\nComputer Games 20\nArts 22\nSport 25\nDiversions 27\nCrossword 28\n\n"

But when you have\nall these other things to play with it\nbecomes a creative process to me. It's all tied in together. As I record a track or\ncompile an album, I'm already thinking\nhow it should look. As an artist who\nworks in the sound medium, that also\ncrosses over into other mediums.

The\nonly kind of discussion we had was\nwhat we were going to name the tracks\nand name the record and what we were\ngoing to call the record label. Not in the\nway that we were going to start this big\nrecord company but we just thought it\nwas important.\nSo as soon as we had the first\nrelease out we said, 'that's cool! Wc\nshould do something else.' And Kenny\nwas sitting there so we said, 'Kenny.\nJohn's got all this studio stuff. Let's get\nin there and bang our heads together\nand sec what happens.' Plus 8 number\ntwo was a Kenny Larkin release. Then it\nwas, T ley Dan! What are you doing?' My\nfriend Dan Bell and I get together and\nthere's Plus 8 number three. By that\ntime it was a group of friends interacting and making music. People started\nsending us tapes.

    "content": "22 Arts 16 November 1998\nWORLD PRESS PHOTO\nRoyal Festival Hall, Main Foyer\nT he World Press Photo exhibition\nfinally reached London a few days\nago. It shows the best of worldwide photography from 1997. The event\ncovers an amazing variety of subjects: scientific pt ogress, tragedies, funny situations, sport exploits and many others.\nHowever, the most striking picture\nremains the one advertised ail over the\nworld: the power image of an Algerian\nwoman in pain crying outside a hospital.\nIn fact, emotions appear throughout the\nexhibition: a picture of a woman from\nAfghanistan shying away from the cam-era, children in Africa being taught about\nAIDS, Kurds fighting for their lives,\ntragedies in Albania or Israel. There are\nalso lots of laughs to be had: priests getting changed to play a football match,\ngay rodeos, Gilbert and George standing\non Brighton beach.\nLach photo had a particular effect on\nme. The exhibition includes only about\n200 pictures, narrowed down from the\n36000 original competition entries, so\nthe work presented here is bound to be\nthe most striking and influential. Thc\nphotos address major issues in the world\nand are often more descriptive than any\nDafoe or the touching picture of Taiwanese newly-weds sleeping in the back\nof their limousine, their heads pointing\nwritten text. They touch a very profound\npart in us without going over the top like\ntelevision so often does. Some are also\njust artistic works without any particular\nmessage like thc Russian Bolshoi\ndancers, the portraits of the actor Willem\nin opposite directions. Progress in the\nfield of science is illustrated too; a series\nof pictures about \"p last i nation\"( pre-serving human bodies or parts) and a hilarious shot of Dolly the sheep, finally,\nthe sports section offers some fascinating photos: Evander Hollyfield's bitten off\near after his match against Mike Tyson,\nCraig Golding's series of sumo s in action\nand, most touching of all, a young baseball team's life on the road travelling\nfrom game to game.\nYou might have seen a few of these\npictures in papers or magazines, but it's brilliant to be able to view them all\ntogether in one room. They're a good\nreminder of the events which occurred\nduring 1997 as well as an indication as to\nwhy photography is so important to us.\nWhich other medium can boast being an\nart, an entertainment and a way of touching human conscience in such a natural\nway?\nD. Until 29th November\nNearest tube: Waterloo/Embankment\nOpening hours: daily 10am10.30 pm Admission: f REE\nTHE INVENTION OF LOVE\nTheatre Royal Haymarket\nT he critically acclaimed\nplaywright Tom Stoppard (Rosencrantz\nand Cuilderstern are Dead,\nArcadia, Indian Ink) is\nrenowned for his meticulous\nresearch when embarking\non projects. His plots are\ngenerally inspired by historical events or real-life char-act ers, this latest piece, a drama tis ed biography of thc poet A. E. Housman\n(1859 - 1936), is no exception.\nStoppard explores the social and cultural climate at the end of thc nineteenth century, in particular with respect\nto homosexuality. Indeed, \"boy worship\nand bugger y\" were then rife in the male\ndominated universities. The trial of Oscar\nWilde serves as a background, illustrating\nthe enforcement of thc 1885 amendment to the Sexual Offences Bill, which\ncriminal is ed homosexual acts until 1967.\nThe play, directed by the esteemed\nRichard Eyre, opens in a ripple of dry ice.\nCharon, a Grim Reaper type ferryman in\nGreek mythology, glides on stage in a punt to collect the recently deceased\nHousman. Our hero is transported back\nto his youth, from which point the audience witnesses his life in flashback. As he\nrevisits his student days at Oxford, the\nunexpected encounter between cynical\nsenior and idealistic junior (intelligently\nperformed by John Wood and Ben\nPorter) occurs. The spectators arc sympathetic to Housman's personal turmoil\n- his unrequited, gay affection for his best friend. He\nsuffers through repressed\npassion, disguised behind\ncamaraderie, and heartbreaking rejection by finding solace in professional\nachievements. Housman\nis a dedicated textual critic\n(correcting faulty translations and unfaithful copies of antique literary manuscripts) and an accomplished\nscholar in the field of Classics (his\nattempts to identify the first ever love\npoem explain the title of the play).\nSadly, the moments of sparkle and\nsensitive humour are clouded by a long-winded script. Although delivered with\ngusto, the dialogue, which contains\nextensive passages in Latin, is often\ntedious and overly intellectual. The subject is genuinely interesting, not only in\nterms of the poet himself, but also in\nview of the turbulent historical period. It\ntherefore seems a great shame to somewhat drown this potential in pedantic\ndetails.\n/ l elena Until 24th April\nNearest tube: Piccadilly Circus\nTickets: half-price standby places for concessions available 1 hour before the performance\nONE WOMAN (part 2)\nBattersea Arts Centre\nc One :j \u00a3* \u00b0<iT his week is the\nsecond art i about th\nWoman festival of <JT\nhe.;'!' and inu' \u2022\nAgain, I saw two n:( shows and both were\nvery enjoyable. The first one, Bondage,\ndescribed a night in the life of a London\nprostitute performed by Sarah Brignall.\nThe play's script was very powerful; Liz\ntalks about her clients as they stop along\nside her. One man in particular returns\ncontinually asking to do it \"without a rubber\". And every time she refuses\nalthough he offers her a lot of money.\nShe then starts telling us about the different types of men she has business\nwith; some are very violent, others have\ntheir particular perversions, most of them\nare old, for some it's their first experience. Liz gradually becomes more personal and shares deep feelings about her\njob and her sacrifices. She left her son\nwith foster parents somewhere in the\ncountryside and it's obviously really hurt\nher. The text and situations are very st rik ing. The only thing that doesn't really fit\nin properly is thc actress. Brignall does-n't have the right tone or manner at all.\nSo the best way to enjoy this production\nis to ignore her performance and concentrate instead on what is being said\nand done.\nThe second performance of the\nnight was Greetings from Hollywood\nplayed by Cyndi Freeman. Here on thc\nother hand, the\nactress is amazing.\nShe does the most\nbrilliant imperson....ations of all her\n| friends as well as of\nj jg some famous pe o ple, frequently making the audience\nlaugh out loud. Her story begins with\n\"when I first moved to LA\", followed by\nthe most crazy and hilarious anecdotes\nimaginable - the day that she decided\nshe was going to act in a TV soft-porn\nmovie for example. She goes through all\nthe rehearsals, detailing how ugly and\nnasty her co-star is, how pretty and dumb\nthe other girls are. She then proceeds to\ntell us about her Monday night group\ntherapy - she is apparently a regular visitor to such sessions! She always realises\ntoo late that all they do is steal her\nmoney. I enjoyed this play tremendously\nthanks to Freeman who really comes\nacross as a natural comedienne.\nI can only urge you to go and see\nsome of these One Woman shows at the\nBAG They all have an interesting edge to\nthem, often making them more exciting\nthat any West End production.\nD.

Cage, as in the wonderful\nFace/Off, is a cop, only this time he Is s eve tal summits short of the moral high\nground and is in fact more bent than a pre-EU banana. Everybody loves a rogue\nthough, and this only adds to his charm.\nThis latest offering from de Palma\ndiverges slightly from his tried-and-tested\nstyle of visually graphic blood, gore and\nmutilation, whilst still retaining the tension of his earlier work. The cinematography is brilliant, as ever. This is especially\nso in some of the flashback scenes,\nwhere the audience is mentally displaced\ninto eyes other than those of the main\ncharacter - an original and unusual experience, only made possible by the robust\nNic Cage. With a gun. Lying on the ground. How original.\nplot. This type of audience translocation\nis not a new approach for de Palma,\nhowever unlike the 'saying one thing,\nthinking another' scenes of Mission\nImpossible, this time it actually works!\nCage performs well, and his emotional torment is believable, although\nthe part is not as demanding as Face/Off\nand it seems as though he is not pushed\nto his limits. With great support from\nSinise and Stan Shaw who plays the\nboxer (who's only fault is a slight lack of\nemotion when beating the hell out of a defenceless man), the plot is held\ntogether well. However, there is definitely something missing from this film,\nbut assuming you are reading this to\ndecide whether or not to go and see the\nfilm, it is very difficult to tell you what that\nmissing factor is without spoiling the\nfilm for you. Let me just say that the\ncasting of one of the main characters\ncould be a little less Siniseter.

Although films like Amateur,\nFlirt and The Unbelievable Truth won\nhim critical acclaim on the arts circuit\nand in underground circles, his films\nare a million miles away from typical\nbox office fodder. Likewise his latest\nfilm, Henry Fool, is hardly representative of modern mainstream US film-making.\nThe film centres on examining\nabout how a seemingly 'common man'\ncan possess un exploited talent while\nanother can delude himself of possessing it. The story is about abin man, Simon Grim, who lives a rather depressing life with his mother and over-sexed\nsister.\nAlong comes Henry Fool to live in\ntheir basement. Loud, chain-smoking,\nbeer-guzzling, a colossal ego maniac and self-styled intellectual, I len ry foo!\nbelieves he will blow a big, wide hole in\nthe literary establishment with his 'Con-fess ion' opus - only he hasn't finished it\nyet.

This\nfilm is no exception, I liked it and\nenjoyed the observations and analyses.\nI also liked Il art ley's proactive stand;\nthough he doesn't issue judgement on\nhis characters, he lets them see truths\nabout themselves.

    "content": "16 November 1998 News 3\nIn brief...\nSouthside Arrest\nLast week Security \"detained a person in\nconnection with criminal damage to the\nSouthside barrier\", according to the security chief, Ken Weir. Three individuals\nwere escorted to the security lodge,\nwhere they refused to identify them-selves. Their obstinacy left security with\nno choice but to call the police. One of\nthe individuals unwisely became abusive\nand was arrested for public order\noffences. The reveller suspected of\nbreaking the barrier also earned a free\ntrip to the station for criminal damage.\nAll three were later identified as stu-dents, but it is not yet known whether\ncharges will be pressed.\nMr Weir stated \"alcohol was\ninvolved\" and was keen to emphasise\nthe futility of withholding identity from\nCollege staff and officials. He explained\nthat if the students involved in last\nweek's incident had disclosed the information when asked the entire matter\ncould have remained within the Colege.\nWilson Update\nSecurity chief Ken Weir recently met with\nthe police's crime prevention unit as a result of last month's burglaries on the\nground floor of Wilson Hall (Fe//x1125). Subsequent recommendations have\nbeen referred to the College Residences\nCommittee. It has been confirmed\nground floor CCTV coverage has been\nruled out due to the potential invasion\nof privacy. Instead more physical mea-sure s, such as fencing, have been\nagreed upon.\nWeeks Break-In\nWeeks Hall has been subject to intruders\non \"a couple of occasions recently\"\nexplained Chief Security Officer Ken Weir.\nThe unfortunate victim was a pool table\nfrom which a \"very small amount of cash\"\nwas stolen. The hall staff and security\nare, however, taking the matter seriously,\nand intend to analyse video evidence in\nan attempt to identify the culprit.\nCash for Questions\nBill Cash MP attended a ConSoc meeting\nlast week.He is rc noun cd and offer\nshunned for his views on Europe, and his\nstance is best described by his phrase:\n\"European Trade: Yes, European Government: No\". One of his major concerns is that of the possible domination\nby Germany that would in his eyes, occur\nif we were governed centrally.\nAn interesting issue raised was that\nof subsidies to German and other European companies which, in his opinion,\ncompete unfairly with our markets to\ntheir advantage. The talk was all the\nmore salient for the questions asked by\nGermans in the audience. Cash\ndescribed a single harmon is ed tax policy as heading for the rocks and\nexpressed his doubts over European\nMonetary Union. In addition to the talk,\nCash signed a number of copies of The]\nEuropean Journal.\nThe next speaker will be Cheryl\nGillian MP in room 342 Mechanical Engineering 1-2pm. RCSU Dinner Rocks On\nLast Tuesday, the Royal College of Science Union held its annual departmental dinners. Due to a lack of first year\nresponse, however, a Constituent College Union wide dinner was formed,\nencompassing all of the science depart-ment s: Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry,\nMaths and Physics.\nThe evening started off well with a sherry reception, generously sponsored\nby the RCSA (RCS graduate association\nAfter the arrival of the RCSU mascot\nTheta and the recently a qui red Mike\n(ICU's mascot), the dinner could begin\nin earnest. Since formal dinners require\nparticipants to remain in the room and\nnot remove their coats or smoke until\nthe Queen has been toasted, the RCSU\nadopts the same rules, and several pint\npenalties were paid by transgressors.\nAfter the food, there were two\nbands for those who resisted the temptations of Le Scandaie. First up were\nHors D 'Uvet, who played a pleasant\nselection of rock, ancient and modern.\nFinishing off with a blinding g rung if i ed rendition of Postman Pat, they had a small crowd bouncing enthusiastically\nNext up were The Men On The Grassy\nKnoll, who played another diverse se lec tion, from Jamiroquai to Rage Against\nThe Machine. The bar stayed open until\n1am, though, so the night was a great\nsuccess.\nBike Branding\nMany students took precautions against\nbike theft and brought their bikes along\nto the ground floor of the Sherfield building to get them stamped, for those who\nmissed out 'on the security campaign\nlast Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,\nand who want their bike stamped security can be contacted on ext 58900.\nA Steamy Affair\nBy Andrew Ofori\nAn eerie mist would have greeted those\nstrolling past the BMS building on Thursday 5 October. Further investigation\nwould have highlighted the bowels of\nthe Queens Lawn as the source.\nAll college buildings arc linked via\nunderground tunnels, which hold the\nlocal area's central services. Joints in a concrete section of a tunnel were leaking water. The level rose above that of\nthe heating pipes which run from the Science Museum and water was boiled off.\nThe particularly cold conditions on Thursday compounded the situation as the\nresulting steam billowed out from an\naccess hole in the Queen's Lawn.\nInitial reports of steam emanating\nfrom a closed man-hole were ignored on\nthe Wednesday night as steam is often\nproduced in the tunnels; but the gravity\nof the situation was clear by the following morning. Areas beneath the BMS\nbuilding, amongst others, were flooded\nwith 4ft of water and have warranted an\nextensive clean-up operation involving a number of days of pumping.

    "content": "g Feature 16 November 1998\nFighting Poverty in the Third Millennium\nIhere is no greater power on earth than an idea whose time has come\" - Victor Hugo\nUnless you never watch television at all\nyou cannot have failed to see the often\ndisturbing news reports from Africa and\nvarious other places around thc world of\ndiseased, malnourished children being\nclutched by their emaciated parents. It\nseems to be somewhere new every\nweek. Probably most of you have felt that\nsomething should be done about it. So\nsometimes we part with a chunk of cash\nwhen asked for it by one of the many\ncharities trying to alleviate such poverty.\nBut if you are anything like me you will\nsometimes despair; the problems seem\nto get worse and more frequent, the\nappeals for money more desperate, and\nyou imagine your small donation being\nswallowed by a black hole of poverty\nthat never grows smaller however much\nyou throw at it. The charities involved are\nof course admirable, and indeed very\nnecessary, but it is true that the huge\npoverty problems will never be solved\nsimply by their aid and development pro-j ect s. Something else must be done, and\nmany people are now coming to realise\nthat something else can be done.\nIn recent years a campaign has been\ngathering strength in 40 countries around\nthe world, initiated by groups such as\nOxfam, Christian Aid, The Guardian and\nThird World First. The name of the campaign is Jubilee 2000 and its aim is the\none-off cancellation by thc year 2000 of\nthe backlog of un payable debt owed by\nthe world's poorest countries. If you\nmissed the link there between dying\nchildren and debt please let me explain.\nIn Ethiopia, 100000 children die\nannually from easily preventable dis-eases. Ethiopia spends four times more\non debt repayments than on health care.\nIt spends scarcely one pound per head\nevery year on education.\nIn Tanzania over half the population\nlive in absolute poverty (i.e. earn less\nthan 60pa day) and 40% of people die\nbefore the age of 35. Tanzania spends six\ntimes more on debt repayment than on\nhealthcare. They give about $100 million\nof their precious foreign currency to pay\nback debts every year. Unfortunately\nthey should be paying more than twice\nthis, so the debt is actually growing,\ncrushing the hope that future generations will be able escape the burden.\nThese kinds of trends are repeated\nagain and again around the world in\ndozens of other countries. I or every \u00a31\nof aid given by the high-income countries\nto thc Third World \u00a39 is taken back in\ndebt repayment. In 1997 the UN estimated that debts would cost thc lives of\n21 million children by-the year 2000 in\nAfrica alone. I could make comparisons\nto deaths in the Second World War, or\nthc number of people killed by Stalin, but\nit would be pointless. Our minds refuse\nto try and comprehend how much suffering there is involved in that one statement of statistics.\nSo to whom are they repaying these\ndebts then? Well, you and me really. The\nvast majority of the debts are owed to\ngovernments of wealthy countries,\nnotably thc G8 countries; Britain, Canada,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and\nthe USA. Some of thc debts ate directly\nowed to the governments, some to multilateral groups such as the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF). The total of ail\nsuch debts is measured in the trillions,\nbut it is estimated that only about \u00a3100\nbillion will have to be cancelled in order\nfor real development to occur in the 52\npoorest countries.\nSo how much will this cost us in\nBritain then? The total debt owed to\nBritain by the poorest countries is about\n\u00a38.8 billion pounds. Of this the Jubilee\n2000 campaign is suggesting that around\n\u00a32.5 billion needs to be cancelled\nurgently. To you that may look a lot, but\nwe live in a wealthy country; it is less than\nthc \u00a33.1 billion spent on National Lottery\nInstants since their launch, about one\nfifth of thc an nua! spending on cigarettes, as a fraction of the annual government budget it is almost insignificant.\nIn fact a lot of the money to cancel the\ndebts is already at hand. 95% of the\ndebts are owed to the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD), which\nrealised some time ago that a lot of the\ndebts were un payable and has been\nstockpiling cash in order to soften the\nblow. But the debts have not been can-celled. In case anyone thought the ECGD\nwas being altruistic when it lent the\nmoney, around half of it was given out\nfor contracts with the British defence\nindustry.\nGiven the above statistics Western\nGovernments have been unable to\nignore the debt problem. They have set\nup the Highly Indebted Poor Countries\n(HIPC) initiative, under the authority of\nthe IMF. The initiative will lead to very limited and inadequate debt cancellation for\na few qualifying countries. To qualify it is\nnecessary for the country to follow a six-year 'austerity' programme under the\nIMF. It will be too little, too late. Let us\nalso think carefully about the meaning of\nthat word 'austerity'; to you or me it\nmeans going without our daily packet of\nMinstrels or some other luxury; to someone who has no luxuries it means cutting\nback on necessities. To someone already\non the verge of starvation that just means\none thing. As one Peruvian economist\nsaid: \"I don't like western solutions to the\ndebt crisis - they kill too many people.\"\nThe fundamental flaw in the HIPC initiative is that it is not designed to relieve\npoverty; its aim is to reach sustainable levels of debt repayment. The Jubilee 2000\nCoalition is calling for unconditional cancellation of debt, to a level where the\ncountries will become capable of development and will be able to lift people\nabove the poverty line. The idea of\nimposing economic reforms on the\ncountries needs to be dropped immediately before more people die of it.\nA small aside now, for the cynics. It\nhas been suggested by some that the\ncancellation of debt will be of no help in\nsome countries because their governments are corrupt and will pocket the\nmoney for themselves. No-one is denying that there are corrupt governments\nin the world but a few points need to be\nmade. Firstly, poverty itself is one of the\nworst causes of corruption - a man\nbrought up on a handful of grain a day\nwill feel a strong temptation to steal. To\nwithhold cancellation because of corruption would simply make the corruption worse. Secondly, as anyone clued-up\nin world affairs will tell you, many of the\ninfamously corrupt governments have\nin recent years either been toppled or are\npursuing new open-government poli-cie s. Thirdly, in cases where the government is still corrupt the loans were given\nin the knowledge that the governments\nwere corrupt, why can they not be cancelled in the knowledge that they are cor-rup t? After all, it is always the poverty\nstricken populations who pay for non-cancellation, not their leaders.\nClearly, there is something that will\nmake a difference - so what can you do\nabout it? The Jubilee 2000 Coalition is\ngathering a petition. They are aiming to\nget 21 million signatures, to make it the\nworlds largest ever petition. If you are not\namong the millions who have already\nsigned then feel free to come to the\nThird World First desk in the JCR 12-2pm today to do so. There will be a chain-link\npetition to sign which will hopefully be\ndisplayed somewhere in College at a later date and there will be more information on what you can do. We live in\na democracy so take advantage of it and\nwrite to your MP, to Gordon Brown, to\nTony Blair or to anyone who represents\nyou and tell them what you think.\nJacob Stringer\nff i imperial College Union j^X JEWISH SOCIETY\npresents the world famous\nRabbi\nShmuely Boteach\nTHE DATING SECRETS\nOF THE\nTEN COMMANDMENTS\n'He's27.

He b lammed it on\nfancying the UCL women's team captain,\nwe realised he was lying - she was too\nugly even for Ed). Our other slight diss-ap ointment was Henry losing our last foil\nfight - I suppose he can be allowed to\nbe a little cocky. Foil score: IC 6 - 3 UCL.\nSabre next and with the men's team\nlacking the expertise of Thorsten \"Never\nHere\" Meyer (again!) we weren't expecting to do well. But with an amazingly\ngood set of wins by Dave (all fights) and\nan OK performance by Henry (for a foi list), but a bit crap from Mo, having lost\na fight as the resident sabre-w icl d cr being the only one that turns up. Unforit across the goal with Spag Bol finishing\nnon cha lent ly. The previous pattern of\nplay continued but LSE started being\nmore dangerous as IC tired and became\nmore and more frustrated with the score\nline. IC were obviously better but we\nfirst couldn't score to make the game\nmore secure.\nThen LSE had a dangerous attack\nwith Red Helmet saving well, followed\nquickly by the second goal that IC so\nbadly needed. Pink Gash sent Blue\nUnderpants sent on a run down the\nwing by Pink Gash, put in a great cross,\nwhich was finished superbly by Jambo\nBwana, our newly discovered goal\nmachine!\nThe result, was undisputed 2-0 to\nthe IC boys.\nhat-trick for IC almost made up for the\nfact that he was wearing a pon cy ban-dana.\nBarts' defence seemed to have been\ntraining with Liverpool FC and only IC's generous finishing kept the score down.\nMentions go to Captain Chunder for\nsome amazing misses and Fluke for\nsquaring up to a fight. Come on you wee\ndancers!\ntun at ely Mo couldn't use the same\nexcuse as Ed as he has better taste - he\nadmitted he was crap. Sabre score: IC 6\n- 3 UCL.\nt pee followed and with such a lead\nthe team relaxed and Rob won all his\nfights, Nige won two of his (good for his\nfirst match of the season) and Eddie lost\nall his fights - at least he won one foil\nfight! Epee score: IC 5 - 4 UCL.\nOverall very good - signs are good\nfor another BUSA team win.\nWomen's team: Foil: Katherine \"Jailbait\"\nSissons, Candy \"Sweetshop\" Tang,\nLcucha \"Arising\" Venger; Epec: Viviene\n\"Barbie\" Ting, Katherine and Leucha.\nDue to a strong UCL women's foil\nteam the birds didn't do too well. Only\nKatherine managed to win her fights. Foil\nscore: IC 3 - 6 UCL.\nThe e pee went a lot better as our\nwomen dominated it. All of the team lost\none fight each that meant scoring went\non hits during fights. Unfortunately the\nslightly poor performance in the foil\nmeant our women's team did not win as\nwe received 8 hits more. It was a very\ngood e pee performance by the women.\nThe only bd thing is that the UCL women\nwere offended when we suggested they\nwere cheating by getting their men's captain to give them tips between points\nin a fight.\nIC 3 - 2 Goldsmiths\nAfter ad is a poln ting draw against St\nGeorges on Saturday from a last minute\nequalise r, the \"notorious motley crew\"\nwere expecting a better outcome from\ntoday's game against a team a couple\nof divisions below us.\nMissing a key player (deep heat) following his \"detainment\" last night we\nwere clearly all suffering from our visit\nto Hombres. Wishart hadn't slept and\nRicki was so rough he had to be substituted after 20 minutes for Chris. Too\nmany shandy's eh!\nThe game was a little unsettled at\nthe start, with Taylor quoted as saying \"I don't know which ball we're playing\nwith as I can see double.\" John D notched up his second of the season\nwith a clinical free kick, but then Goldies\ntook advantage of our dazed state scoring two goals in quick sucess ion. At half time heads were low, but a stern \"kick up the arse\" team talk by the\ncaptain Elliot, who dominated the game\nin the air, led lo a \"Gary Lineker\" goal\nfrom Gurm (the teams top scorer). After\nthis the mighty fourths played like the\nteam they actually are, commanding\nthe game until the third goal finally\ncame, and what a goal it was. Aidan\npicked up the balls about 35 yards out,\ndribbled through their defence like a wizard and fin shed with a superb strike.\nThe fourths really had to dig deep\ntoday and although the fire in our bellies was only ignited at half time, how\nit burned. All together now I rom the\npubs of South Kensington\nVolleyball\nIC Ladies' 11 -15 UCL\nThis might have been a defeat but we\nare not at all discouraged by it! The\nladies' volleyball team lost against UCL\nlast Wednesday 4th November in what\nwas an exciting and enjoyable match.\nThe first set started out well but then silly\nmistakes and careless serving made us\nlose the advantage we got during the\nfirst few minutes and ended 9-15.\nSet 2 saw a great revival and we\nplayed with enthusiasm and determination winning the set by 15-13. Finally,\nwe lost morale and our opponents took\nadvantage of our increasing careless-ness. Towards the end though we were\nslowly gathering up strength again...\nbut then it was too late. We look forward\nto playing good matches like this in the\nnear future... hopefully we will change\nthe score to our favour!\nIC 3 -1 Royal Free\nDespite not being accustomed to playing on pitches wider than they are long\nand on a30 degree incline, IC settled\ninto the game well and Ginger put us a goal up before long. Jazz scored after a goal mouth scramble resulting from a Hacker cross. It was all too clear who the\nbetter team were. Hedge, Froud and\nWannabe Yank had little to do in\ndefence until Free put a Wimbeldon\nstyle ball through to pull one back.\nElhosh put one in after skipping past the\nbutch Free defenders to make it 3-1. And\nthat's how it stayed.\nIC 3 - 2 St Georges\nA daunting task faced us with SG having\na full team and subs but after a prep talk\nfrom Hacker and the decision to play\nwithout a midfield, we were assured\nthat the midgets couldn't dent us if they\ntried. And we were right. Boris put IC a goal up within 10 minutes, but SG\ncaught us off-guard and stuck one in\npast Melody (despite the attempts by\nBaldrich to hack their players down) to\nlevel the score and it remained 1\n-1 at\nhalf-time. Some nice passing between\nHacker and Chesire Cat resulted in\nBoris's second goal of the game, which\ntricked over the line just past the SG\nkeepers reach. SG equalise d again and just when we thought it was all over\nsome superb individual skill from Boris\nin the last S minutes made the scot c32 to IC and a well deserved win!\nMarie 'Hacker' Nicholaou\nWomen's rugby\nIC Virgins 37 - Kings 10\nWE WON!!

I suppose I had gone in with\nthe belief that everybody who got to interview would be a good\ncandidate and that the\ninterview was more of a formality than anything\nelse. How wrong I was!\nI have been through the admissions\nprocess twice now, I have braved the\nroller-coaster ride that is the six months\nbetween sending off the UCAS form and\nfinally getting the grades that mean you\nare now a student and I think I'm pretty\n'I know that about\nseventy five percent of my first per\nson al statement\nwas truthful in fact\nbut not really truthful in spirit.'\nwell up on all the rubbish\nthat people put in their personal statements to make\nthem look good.

I think that my generous helping\nof GCSEs with plenty of 13s, the odd A to\nshow that I could read, write and do\nChemistry, thc solitary C to show that a career in trance would be\nNick Newton a bad idea and a three As\nat A level prediction (even\na suspect one) was perfectly adequate.\nHow wrong could I have been. The first\nhalf dozen candidates\nclocked aC,a few Bs,\na comfortable number\nof As, and about a million A stars. How lucky\nI was that these insidious grades had not\nbeen invented when I did my GCSEs.\nFinally, the straw\nto break the proverbial\ncamel's back came\nwhen I looked at thc\ndate of birth. These\npeople made me feel\nreally old. They are children of the eighties - and fine, the cynics among you will\nsay that I was hardly in a position to\nappreciate the seventies - but I was there\nin body, even if it was only for a few years\n\"Anyway, the old\nmedical hands\namong you will be\n3lad... to know that\nam doing my best\nto maintain the\nintake standard of\nstudents...\"\nand I wasn't really in any fit state to\nappreciate what was going on.\nAnyway, the old medical hands\namong you will be glad (??) to know that\nI am doing my best lo\nmaintain the intake\nstandard of students\nthat made Charing\nCross, Westminster\nand St. Mary's great.\nWe can only hope that\nin the cut-throat world\nof league tables and\nacademic super-excel-le ncea few normal\npeople will be lucky\nenough to make it\nthrough the admissions minefield; those;\nwho have enough left\nof whatever it is that\nmakes a good medical student and a good doctor; enough left to make it\nthrough medical school.

A great app et is er before any\nmain course!\nWell, that's about as much as I need to say apart from the following:\nOne man's meat is another man's poi-son, but there is food for everyone\nhere!\nContact simon.hay hurst@ lc.ac.uk\nPresidential Talk-Back\nDavid Hellard,\nAn issue that\ninevitably\ncomes up\nevery year is\nmoney and the lack of it.\nWith tuition fees and general\nliving prices rising in London\nit would be a safe bet to say\nthat people will be desperate m0r or v\\ hale\\ i\" morn \\ I g<i,I' Mi:I, il \\ rI! \u2022\n> '\n\u2022\nI',:.I \u2022.:\u2022,;\u2022.!\n:- no loi '\nFor some reason this doesn't. seem to be the case though.\nEvery year Imperial College\nreceives about a third of a million\npounds from the government, which\ngoes into an access fund for UK stu-dents, if it's not spent it goes straight\nback, so it stands to reason that we\nwould want to give it to our students;\nshouldn't be hard right? Wrong. To get\nyour hands on this all you have to do\nis apply to it with some justification as\nto why you need it - couldn't be sim-p ler. Last year 690 students received an\naverage of around \u00a3500 each from\nthis fund, but this year only 60 people\nhave applied. Does this worry me?\nWell yes and no; its great that nobody\nseems to need any financial support -maybe everyone's ok - but I am worried that people arc out there who\ndesperately need this money just to\nremain at University. Thc deadline for\nautumn has already passed us, but\nyou can apply in\nICU President spring, if you\nreally need more\nmoney just lo\njj| survive, please apply; to find\nout more j usl ask in room\n1 ol the Shcrfield building.\nStill on thc issue of\n/ money thc Dillons Hardship\nf Book fund is a fund that\n; n ives students money to buy\nu. in; \u2022 ili,-t, \u00bbres seii ii al;oi heir course, but they can't afford to buy. All you have to do is fill\nout an application form that you can\nobtain from the Union Office and send\nit off by thc 27th November, this may\nseem like a waste of time, but thc\nfund is worth \u00a38000 and last year only\n11 people applied; thc message is\nthey're gagging to give you money,\nwhy not let them?\nI'd just like to say thank's to everyone for the feedback as to which student discounts you want, keep them\ncoming. I'm on thc case of a few of\nthem already, but I 'll give you a full\nreport of the results next week\n(although I'm not lh at confident about\ngetting thc buy one get one free offer\nwith Aston Martin that someone asked\nfor; student hardship?)\n\n"
