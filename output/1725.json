The\nwinners are chosen from\nnominations, by a student\npanel appointed by the\nUnion President which\nusually includes members\nof the Union Council.\nTen specific awards\nwere given. Campaign\nof the Year went to the\nBelieve and Do Good\ncampaign by the Muslim\nMedics and Imperial\nIslamic Society, while\nthe Event of the Year was\ngiven to the Dance Imperial Show, a collaboration\nbetween all six dance\nsocieties at Imperial.\nThe CGCU and Docsoc\nImperial hosts Prime Minister Theresa May\nNEWS\n(cont.)\nwon the Contribution to\nCollege Life Award for\ntheir Diversity in Engineering initiative. The best\npreviously-existing and\nnew Club, Society, and\nProject of the Year awards\nwere given to Design\nEngineering and to ICSM\nCoding respectively.\nThe awards for academic and wellbeing\nreps were distributed\nacross many departments.\nMathematics had both the\nbest wellbeing rep team\nand individual academic\nrep, which went to Bogosi\nShashane. The best\nundergraduate academic\nrep team was ICSMSU\u2019s,\nwhile the top postgraduate\nteam was Geotechnics\u2019\nAugustin Ruiz Lopes and\nJulia Moeller. The award\nfor individual wellbeing\nrep went to the RSM\u2019s\nArman Sarjou.\nAlongside these, 37\nUnion Colour awards\nwere given to individual\nstudents who have made\nrepeated contributions\nthroughout the year. This\nis significantly lower than\nin previous years \u2013 69\nwere awarded in 2017 and\n2018.

The winners of\nthese awards can be\nviewed on the Union\nwebsite.\nAmong the Fellowship\nearners was Joe O\u2019Connell-Danes, described as\nthe \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the\nnewspaper in his nomi-nation. Joe served as the\nArts and Entertainment\nManagement Chair during\nthe year, and (amongst\nother things) facilitated\nthe media coverage of\nMeet the Candidates as\nwell as the IC Symphony\nOchestra's upcoming tour\nof China. He shared what\nthe award meant to him:\n\u201cReceiving the fellowship was a nice recognition of the work I've put\nin over the last few years.\nThe nature of my role is\nvery operational - it involves working behind the\nscenes on issues that aren't\nvery creative or glamor-ous, and if you\u2019re doing it\nwell nobody should really\nknow much about it. In\nfact, the highlight of the\nawards evening wasn\u2019t\nmy Fellowship, but Dance\nImperial winning Event\nof the Year for the Dance\nImperial Show.

I\nknow right, time really\nflies! As we creep to\nthe end of my tenure as\nEditor-in-Chief, people\nkeep asking me the inevitable question. \"How\ndo you feel Andy? Is it\nsad to be approaching\nyour final issue?\" To\nthis, my honest answer\nis: I'm tired. It hasn't\nyet sunk in really that\nmy last issue is next\nweek. I'm sure if you\nask me the question this\ntime next week, I will\nbe overcome by a wave\nof emotion but, for now,\nit's business as usual.\nHaving said all that,\nI have naturally been in\nquite a reflective mood\nover the last few weeks.\nEspecially given that, this\nweek, I started the handover process with next\nyear's editor, Henry, I have\nbeen doing a fair bit of\nself-evaluation. If you ask\nme, it's been a strong year\nfor the paper (though the\nquality of the Editorials\nhas taken a real nose dive)\nand I couldn't have done\nit without the remarkable\nefforts of the amazing\nFelix Editorial team. It's\nalso been refreshing to\nwitness Henry's enthusiasm for Felix on a firsthand basis and there's not\na shadow of doubt in my\nmind that I'm leaving the\npaper in safe and more\nthan capable hands.\nIn slightly more\nsobering news, today\nmarks two years to the\nday since the Grenfell\nTower disaster. At the\ntime, I was a third year\nChemical Engineering\n2\nstudent living in Ladbroke\nGrove, a stone's throw\nfrom Grenfell Tower. I\nremember my housemate\ntelling me about the\nsound of fire engine sirens\nblaring through the night.\nI remember seeing smoke\nbillowing from the tower\nduring my walk in to\nCollege that morning. I\nremember the gravity of\nwhat had happened not\nreally sinking in until I got\nback home after my last\nexam that day and seeing\ncountless 'missing person'\nPHOENIX,\nImperial\u2019s magazine, formerly known as\nIf you are interested in Grime\n& Black British music, we want\nto hear from you!\nWhat does Grime mean to\nyou?\nIf you\u2019re interested, please email Felix@imperial.ac.uk\nreturns...with a twist!\n3\nISSUE 1725\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nposters stuck up around\nthe area. It is important\nthat we remember this dis-aster. It is important that\nwe remember that it has\nbeen two years and still\nnobody has been held ac-countable. It is important\nthat we remember that it\nhas been two years and\nsome of the victims are\nstill living in temporary\nhousing.\nSection of the Week\nfor this week goes to the\nPolitics section, which\nincludes an extremely important article providing\nan overview of the humanitarian crisis currently\nhappening in Sudan,\nwritten by my housemate,\nBozza. Next week's issue\nof Felix will include a\nfollow-up article detailing\nwhat we can do to help\nbut, for now, spreading\nthe word through social\nmedia, etc. is helpful in\nraising awareness of the\nsituation so that it reaches\nmainstream news and\nmedia outlets.\n#IAmTheSudanRevo-lution\nexpressed their admiration of Imperial\u2019s Carbon\nCapture Pilot Plant and\nthe College\u2019s wider work\nin carbon capture and\nstorage, climate change\nand energy research.\nClaire Perry MP com-mented, \"it's an amazing\nfacility here... to me, this\nis the Industrial Strategy\nin action\".\nSpeaking to Felix,\nFerdinand commented:\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s commitment\nto net zero carbon\nemissions by 2050 is\nindeed exemplary and the\nsort of radical decision\nmaking required to curb\nglobal warming. Carbon\ncapture and storage is an\nimperative part of this and\nthe PM was able to get a\nfeel for the techniques,\nscalability and problems\nfacing the technology. She\nwas full of questions and\nseemed pleased with the\nanswers she got, as such\nI\u2019d consider the visit a\nsuccess.\u201d\nThe PM and minister\nalso met PhD students,\nJanet Skitt and Parth Shah,\nwho demonstrated their\nwork. Janet\u2019s work, which\nfocuses on generating\nliquid fuels from second\ngeneration carbon neutral\nfuels that are compatible\nwith existing vehicles,\ncould play a pivotal role in\ndecarbonizing transport.\nParth\u2019s work revolves\naround the continuous\nsynthesis of metal oxide\nnanoparticles, while developing scalable, energy\nefficient processes that\nminimise waste water.\nPrime Minister Theresa\nMay concluded her\nvisit with the following:\n\u201cAs the first country to\nlegislate for long-term\nclimate targets, we can\nbe truly proud of our\nrecord in tackling climate\nchange. We have made\nhuge progress in growing\nour economy and the jobs\nmarket while slashing\nemissions. Now is the\ntime to go further and\nfaster to safeguard the\nenvironment for our\nchildren. This country led\nthe world in innovation\nduring the Industrial Revolution, and now we must\nlead the world to a cleaner,\ngreener form of growth.\nStanding by is not an\noption. Reaching net zero\nby 2050 is an ambitious\ntarget, but it is crucial that\nwe achieve it to ensure\nwe protect our planet for\nfuture generations.\u201d\n\u201cShe was full\nof questions\nand seemed\npleased with\nthe answers\nshe got\u201d\n\n"

A\nretelling of the Brothers\nGrimm fairy-tale, over\nninety dancers and a\nlive orchestra unfold a\ndream-like sequence with\nresplendent balls, forest\ncreatures and a familiar\nlove story.\nDifferent from the\ngraduation setting that we\nare more accustomed to,\nthe ice rink-shaped stage\nof the Royal Albert Hall\nis beautifully harnessed\nwith an entourage of light\nprojections, a chandelier,\nand curtains, building\neach scene to aid the sto-rytelling. Whether this be\nby the palace fa\u00e7ade, or a\nballroom with portraits of\nroyalty (which change in a\ncomedic way), the setting\nexudes a feeling of gran-diosity that you cannot\nhelp but want to be a\npart of. The 18th century\ncostumes of the human\ncharacters are gorgeous,\nthe creativity and comedy\nof the woodland creature\ncostumes (massive puppet\nand bird heads) equally\nelaborate, and they all tie\ninto a wonderful, mesmer-ising piece.\nThis opulence,\nhowever, is frequently\ndisturbed for those seated\nnear the aisles as dancers\nconstantly scuttle back\ntion into a beauty with silk\nwings, and her stepmother\nin a duet with her champagne glasses and waking\nup hungover and puking\ninto the pot of porridge.\nA routine with the\nwoodland creatures and\nthe comedic search for the\nshoe\u2019s perfect fit provided\na myriad of reactions,\nfrom enthrallment to\nlaughter.

Yet it is\nrarely staged.

Unfortunately for the two parties,\nRosmer himself has lost\nhis faith and renounced\nhis family\u2019s wealth, practically throwing heirlooms\nat his staff. This sudden\nchange follows the suicide\nof his wife the previous\nyear, and the urging of\nRebecca West (the breathtaking and show-stealing\nHayley Atwell), whose\nprogressive beliefs of\nequality and politics spur\nRosmer to act in the best\nway for the people.\nHamilton\u2019s Giles Terera\nis worryingly charming\nas an almost-fascist local\ngovernor determined\nto sway brother-in-law\nalmost absurd, especially\nregarding Rebecca\u2019s past,\nbut Atwell and Burke are\nso convincing in their\nrespective losses, it is\naccepted and embraced.\nThe costumes by\nRae Smith were divine,\nwith the set and lighting\nused to an incredible\ndegree to show not only\nthe passing of time, but\nalso the growth of the\ncharacters.

    "content": "ISSUE 1725\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nA Review of Petals of Blood\nA deeply empathetic story set in post-colonial Kenya\nI\nn a sentence, Petals\nof Blood is a story\nof change through\nthe eyes of those\noppressed. The author,\nNg\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o, uses\nthe murder, by arson, of\nthree prominent figures\nin an emerging town\nto frame the narrative\nof the transformation\nof a backward (or un-blemished?) village\ninto a prospering (or\nsoulless) town. Its cast\nof protagonists: Munira,\nthe teacher and flawed\nhero, Karega, one of\nhis former students,\nAbdulla, a crippled business man and Wanja,\na strong-willed but\nmercurial prostitute, are\nsymbols for the means\nby which the people\nare oppressed. It is a\ndeeply empathetic and\ndeeply intelligent novel,\nalluding to Shakespeare\nand the Bible with equal\nease as to former leaders\nof the Kenyan resistance and early British\ncolonists. For instance,\ntogether with the op-pressors, the characters\nmap unexpectedly to\nthose in a passage from\nWalt Whitman quoted\nby Ng\u0169g\u0129, \u201cfrightened\nmonarchs come back;\nEach comes in state,\nwith his train - hangman,\npriest, tax-gatherer,\nSoldier, lawyer, lord,\njailer, sycophant\u201d.\nAlthough they are clearly symbols of something\ngreater, Ng\u0169g\u0129 does\ncreate multi-dimen-sional and rich figures\nwhose stories, although\nBOOKS\nArtur Donaldson\nSustainability Editor\ninterconnected with\nmasterful serendipity,\nare slowly revealed as\nwe journey through the\nbook. The one character\nwhose story I feel could\nbe told better is Karega,\nwhose tale is told largely in intermittent bursts\nof drunken monologue.\nI found it a challenging read because it is a\nbook not written, as the\nmajority to be found in\nthe English language,\nfor consumption by\nwhite Europeans and\nAmericans. Indeed,\nit is probably these\nwho Ng\u0169g\u0129 refers to as\nthe white tourists or\n\u201cwatalii\u201d who unsus-pectingly buy fruits and\nsheepskins from characters such as the destitute\nKarega on the roadside.\nThere is so much rich\nculture and history that\nI feel is inaccessible to\nme as a white European\nlacking the oral heritage\nof Africa and, although\npainful, I found it a\nwelcome discovery. The\nbook is a message of\nlament for the suffering\nendured by a nation,\nof caution about the\npromises of \u201cdevelopment\u201d, and of hope to\nKenya of the 1970s. It\nis a message addressed\nby Ng\u0169g\u0129, perhaps to\nhis fellow countrymen,\nor maybe to himself.\nEither way, it was\nclearly a message heard\nsince, like Karega in\nPetals of Blood, he was\nimprisoned shortly after\nfor his publication of a\nplay, Ngaahika Ndeenda\n(\u201cI will marry when I\nwant\u201d).\nOne lesson that stood\nout to me from Petals\nof Blood is how capitalism has the potential\nto destroy culture. That\nis to say, the actual\nstories of the people\naffected. What might\nbe counted as progress\nby international development organisations\nleads, in the story, to the\ndestruction of culture\nand local self-sufficien-cy. When the villagers\ncreate an enterprise out\nof Thenget\u2019a, a drink\nbrewed occasionally as\npart of local tradition,\na monstrous narcotic\nmonopoly is created\nwhich overturns the\nlives of many, including\nMunira, and is quickly\ntaken over by powerful\nKenyan elite and international corporations.\nFurthermore, this was\nfacilitated by the construction of a major\nroad through the village\nwhich supplied thirsty\nroad workers and truck\ndrivers - the first unwitting customers. Though\nthe village becomes\nfamous, the herdsmen\nare no longer dependent on fickle rains and\nthe owners of the new\nbusinesses have access\nto businesses and trade,\nthe ones who created\nthe transformation of\nthe village into a town\nbecome destitute while\npowerful politicians and\nbusinessmen profit.\nThough I cannot speak\nfor the relevance of the\nbook to modern-day\nKenyans or if the story\nreflects historical development of any village,\nI can say that the book\nis a precious unfiltered\nglimpse into a rich\nand largely unwritten\nculture of the country.\nIt gives an understanding of the country that\nwill be missed by those\nwho only read books of\nAfrican history produced\nby white academics,\nthose who follow tourist\nbooks, or go on package\nsafari holidays. I am\nvery grateful for having\nfound this precious gem\nof a book in the Imperial\nCollege library, especially in a University\nthat sadly shares its\nname with the force that\ncaused so much of this\nsuffering.\n\n"

This\nweek Tom and\nI move into\nmore personal territory,\ntouching on the beginning\nof our journey as entre-preneurs. This will be\nfollowed next week by\na final piece detailing\nImpromptu itself.\nThe inspiration for\nour decision to create\nan app stems from our\ntime as PhD students in\nthe Faculty of Medicine.\nFor years we had talked\nabout random app ideas;\nseveral of which launched\nat a later date and became\nvery successful. We eventually realised that it was\npointless having these\nconversations (and the\nsubsequent depression!)\nunless we were willing to\ntake the proverbial bull by\nthe horns and act upon our\nideas.\nOur aim was always\nto develop an app which\nwould benefit university\nstudents and academics.\nIf we could also extend\nthis idea to society at\nlarge, even better. Our\ninitial brainstorming\nsessions yielded no short\nof a dozen ideas. To our\ncredit we were able to\nimmediately recognise\nthat the majority of these\nwere poorly thought\nthrough and devoid of any\nsignificant USPs. Twelve\nbecame two! At this time\nTom and I decided to\nmeet with someone who\nhad been recommended to\n\u201cThe\ninspiration for\nour decision to\ncreate an app\nstems from our\ntime as PhD\nstudents in\nthe Faculty of\nMedicine. \u201d\nus as a potential partner.\nOur team grew, adding\nrelevant industry exper-tise. This gentleman was\nsmart, personable and\nestablished in the tech\nworld. We collectively\nselected our preferred\nidea, a community based\nlending platform, and set\nabout realising this by designing our own prototype\nusing online resources.\nOur background\nresearch into the viability\nof this idea was favoura-ble. Our goal was to be as\nself-sufficient as possible\nand to design and build the\nplatform without seeking\nexpert help. In hindsight\nthis was a mistake. Our\nchoice of name was spot\non. Our colourways were\ngreat. But our knowledge\nof branding, functionality\nand back-end (databases\nand so on) left a lot to be\ndesired. Our new partner\nwas also finding himself\nincredibly busy with two\nyoung children and his\nday job (his employer had\nrecently been acquired\nby Microsoft). Despite\nhis best intentions he\nwas finding it harder to\nallocate time to the project\nand the technical aspects\nhe was expert in.\nThis state of limbo\nwent on for months before\nwe formally approached\na development house.\nThis was exciting to say\nthe least and also served\nto reaffirm confidence in\nour ideas. The developers\nwere keen and offered\nto build our prototype\nfor a small upfront cost.\nThis was to include high\nresolution mock ups of\n20 screens, branding,\ncolourways and technical\nspecifications.\nThe next two months\nsaw various changes in the\nteam and the near-com-pletion of our prototype.\nWe were almost there, or\nknowing we would have\nto adapt functionality to\ncompete, or change track\nentirely.\nThe former was simply\nnot viable for a number\nof reasons. We had no\nalternative but to start\nagain. As you can imagine\nthis was disheartening.\nHowever, the decision to\npursue this first idea was\nnarrowly won and we\nhad an alternative which\nwe were very passionate\nabout and which our\ndevelopers thought was\neasier to implement. Our\ndevelopers took pity on\nour situation and were\nkind enough to allow us\nto switch ideas without\npenalty. This idea was to\nbecome Impromptu.\nAs I\u2019m sure you can\ngather, our journey to date\nhasproventobesomewhat\nof a rollercoaster. This\nis not dissimilar to many\nothers in our position and\nis not meant to deter you.\nRather we hope to illustrate that there are often\nsolutions to seemingly\nmassive problems.\nJoin us next week where\nwe detail our app and its\nfunctionality.\nISSUE 1725\nFELIX\n7\nTECH tecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nImpromptu is launching to Imperial students in two months\u2019time // Impromptu\n\u201cOur goal\nwas to be as\nself sufficient\nas possible\nand to design\nand build\nthe platform\nwithout\nseeking\nexpert help.

    "content": "SUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 14TH\nJUNE, 2019 FELIX\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTodayChinahasconsumed\nmore natural resources\nthan it can replenish\n\u201cJust 19% of\nthe global\npalm oil\nproduction is\nRSPO certified\u201d\nits standard in 2013, the\nWWF and others stated\nthat the changes had not\ngone far enough to address\nthe issue. The WWF has\nargued that RSPO standards have fallen short in\nterms of greenhouse gas\nemissions, banning of\nthe most harmful chemicals like paraquat, and\nensuring that only legal\npalm oil was entering\nmills. Several leading\ngrowers agreed, and individual brands and growers\nhave made their own \u201cno\ndeforestation\u201d commitments since then.\nIt can be argued that\nthe pace of change is too\nslow. 14 million tonnes\nof palm oil is RSPO cer-tified, which is just 19%\nof global palm oil produc-tion. This low proportion\nof sustainably-sourced\npalm oil is despite\ncommitments made by\nmajor manufacturers and\nproducers of palm oil to\nsource 100% of palm oil\nsustainably by the mid-2010s, a deadline which a\nconsiderable number have\nfailed to meet.\nFurthermore those who\nhave had adopted certification initially struggled\nto find demand. Nearly\nhalf (48.3 %) of the 8.59m\ntonnes of certified palm oil\nproduced in 2013 failed\nto attract a buyer. This is\na huge issue since the oil\nitself was sold at the same\nprice as conventional\npalm oil and therefore\ndidn\u2019t give the incentive\nfor producers to get their\noil certified.\nHowever, government\nregulation can be effective\nin creating change. In\n2014, the EU introduced\nlegislation mandating\ntransparent labelling of\npalm oil on all products.\nThis means that it must\nbe explicitly labelled,\nas opposed to listed as a\ngeneric \u201cvegetable oil\u201d\nor other synonyms. In the\nfirst two quarters of 2014\nthere was a 65 % increase\nin sales of certified palm\noil. The governments of\nMalaysia and Indonesia\nhave introduced legislation on palm oil producers\nwhich is essentially a\n\u2018watered down\u2019 version\nof RSPO criteria. Government legislation both by\npalm oil-producing countries and by countries that\nare the largest consumers\nof palm oil can be effective in tackling the issue.\nConclusion\nPalm oil is an incredibly energy efficient crop\ncompared to other oil\ncrops - it requires fewer\nresources to grow and\nproduces up to three times\nmore oil in the same area\nof land. Replacing palm\noil with any of its substitutes will be worse for\nthe environment, as more\nland will be needed to\nyield the same amount of\noil. Furthermore, some of\nthe properties of palm oil\nmean other oils would be\nunsuitable.\nHaving said that, deforestation due to agriculture is a very real problem\nin many countries. The\nlargestusersofpalmoilare\nmanufacturers, and thus\npressure must be placed\non industry to ensure they\nmeet standards. Government legislation can be\neffective in achieving\nthis, as demonstrated by\nthe impact of mandatory\ntransparent labelling in\nthe EU. Furthermore,\nby making informed\nchoices, customers can\nhave an impact. Instead of\nboycotting palm oil com-pletely, opting for sus-tainably grown palm oil\nfrom certified producers is\na good first step towards\nsustainability. A further\nsteps would be to ensure\nthat palm oil is fully\ntraced (not just mixed).\nDespite there being some\nconcerns about the rigor\nof palm oil certification,\ncertification brings transparency throughout the\nsupply chain and forces\nproducers to be more\nmindful of their environmental impact.\nPalm Oil: Friend or Foe?\nAreportonpalmoil,commissionedfortheImperialCollegeUnionshop,suggestspalmoilcanbeenvironmentally\nand socially positive so long as it is sourced sustainably\nSUSTAINABILITY\nPetra Bachanov\u00e1,\n\u201cPalm oil has a\nvery high yield\ncompared\nto other\nvegetable\noils.

This\narticle aims to summarize\nthe implications of growing production and export\nof palm oil, primarily\nfrom South-East Asia and\nthe controversial question\nof its sustainability and\ncertification.\nPalm oil has a very\nhigh yield compared to\nother vegetable oils. In\n2011 it produced 22% of\nthe world\u2019s vegetable oil\ndespite using less than\n2% of the area used for\ngrowing oil crops. Palm\noil is often grown on\nnewly cleared forests, as\nproducers use the profit\nfrom timber to subsidise\nsetting up a new planta-tion. Due to this, palm\noil plantations have led\nto destruction of natural\nhabitats and thus driven\nnative wildlife to face\nextinction. Certified sustainable sources of palm\noil try to strike a balance\nin being environmentally\nfriendly and economically\nviable.\nWhat is the big deal\nIs palm oil production\nleading to habitat loss?\nMost likely yes. A study\nusing information from\nsatellite imagery and the\nFood and Agriculture\nOrganization of the UN\nfound that a significant\nproportion of land which\nwas covered in forest in\n1990 was used for palm\noil production by 2015 in\nMalaysia and Indonesia.\nThis is particularly concerning as the peat-rich\nsoil in these regions continues to release GHGs\nfrom soil for decades after\ndeforestation.\nIs palm oil production responsible for\nthe dramatic decline in\norangutan populations\nin Indonesia? A study of\norangutan populations\non the Indonesian island\nof Borneo found that\n50% of the population\nwas affected by natural\nresource extraction, including deforestation for\noil palm plantations, and\nalso found a decline in the\nBornean orangutan population of 100,000 between\n1999 and 2015. However,\nthe same study found\nthat the greatest factor in\nthe decline in orangutan\npopulations was likely\nhunting, while clearing\nfor oil crops was responsible for approximately 9%\nof species decline.\nmore harm. The WWF\nargue that palm oil \u201chas\nthe potential to be a major\nforce for sustainable development\u201d.\nAlso, according to\nthe WWF, of the top\nfive UK-based users\nof palm oils, four are\nmanufacturers including\nReckitt Benckiser (which\nproduces Dettol, Cillit\nBang and uses 125000\ntonnes) and United\nBiscuits (McVitie\u2019s, go\nahead!, 76000 tonnes) and\none is a retailer (Tesco,\n31000 tonnes). All of\nthese use 100% Certified\nSustainable Palm Oil\n(CSPO). However, few\nhave ensured that the\npalm oil is from segregated sources, meaning that\ngeographical origin for\nmany is unknown.\nPalm oil is used in\nover 50% of supermarket products ranging\nfrom bread to shampoo.\nReasons for its abundance\ninclude its availability,\nlow cost and favourable\nchemical properties\nfor a wide range of\napplications. It also has\nlow levels of trans fats,\nwhich are associated with\ncardiovascular diseases,\ncompared with other oils.\nFurthermore GHG\nemissions in the growth\nand production of oil\npalm are relatively\nsmall, setting aside any\ndeforestation, compared\nwith other oils, and the\nRoundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)\nhas developed a tool for\npalm oil producers to\nmonitor and control the\nGHG emissions in their\noperations.\nWhat is certifica-Should you bar palm oil from your chocoloate bar?

    "content": "ISSUE 1725\nFELIX\n19\nLIBERATION felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBreaking the Taboo on Eating Disorders\nLIBERATION\nEmma Couves\nPhD Student & FoNS Academic & Welfare Officer\nF\nour years ago this\nweek, I remember\ncompleting my\nUCAS form and\nputting Imperial as my\nfirst-choice university. At\nthe time, I was oblivious\nreally to my falling mental\nand physical health. My\neating disorder started\nlong before Imperial but\nit wasn\u2019t until I got here,\naway from my family and\nsupport, that I realised\njust how overwhelming\nan eating disorder can be.\nEating disorders are\ndifficult illnesses to\ncope with and there is\na lot of misinformation\nabout them. The media,\nin some ways, glorifies\neating disorders and never\naddresses the true crux of\nproblem. In some cases,\neating disorders are about\nbody image. However,\nit\u2019s not that simple; not\nall eating disorders are\nabout weight loss and the\nmajority of eating disorder\nsufferers are not under-weight. Eating disorders\nare about control and\nperfection. The sufferer\nfeels out of control when\neating and then might go\nto great lengths to regain\ncontrol over eating, which\nmanifests as dangerous\nbehaviour.\nless than 80% probably\nmeans you wouldn\u2019t\nmake your grade offer for\nthis institution, fosters a\nlevel of perfectionism.\nThen being thrown into\nan environment where\nperfectionism in academia\nis nigh-on impossible is\na bigger challenge than\nanyone really admits.\nFor seven years, we have\nbeen trained to believe\nthe university expectation\nof a \u201cgood score\u201d is just\nsimply not good enough.\nThis drastic change can\nleave high-performing\nstudents feeling vulnerable and out-of-control.\nand body image, I didn\u2019t\neven notice the illness run\naway from me until I was\nvery much under its grasp.\nGetting help for my\neating disorder was a\nlong process. Ultimately,\nI was in denial and an\nover reliance by doctors\non BMI can mean it is\ndifficult to access the\nsupport needed. There is\ndangerous underfunding\nof eating disorder care,\nwhich means you can\nbe \u201cnot ill enough\u201d to\naccess the therapy you\nso desperately need. This\nis something battled tirelessly by campaigners but\nit can make accessing care\ntricky. BEAT, an eating\ndisorder awareness charity\nhave some excellent\nadvice on how to negotiate that first meeting with\na doctor. Being prepared\nmassively helped because\neven when I got upset or\nfound it difficult to talk, I\nhad already planned what\nto say. The support BEAT\ngives is excellent and I\nremember being on the\nphone with one of their\nadvisors the night before,\ntalking me through the\nappointment and what to\nexpect.\nI was already seeing a\ndoctor about my mental\nhealth before that \u2018first\nmeeting about eating\u2019.\nMy first appointment was\ndifficult, I didn\u2019t feel like\nI managed to convey my\nbehaviour with food and\nthe whole consultation\nrevolved around BMI\nand weight. It would\ntake another two months\nbefore I went for another\nappointment. The second\ntime I was switched to\nsomeone else last minute\nand she seemed to take my\nconcern more seriously.\nI was eventually referred\nonto a medical study\nlooking at the impact of\nearly intervention therapy\nin eating disorder recovery\nand luckily accessed\ntherapy soon after my\nreferral. I say \u201clucky\u201d;\nfive years with an eating\ndisorder I was still classed\nas \u201cearly-intervention\u201d.\nThere were times at\nImperial I felt very alone.\nDue to an outdated and\nfrankly horrendous notion\nthat eating disorders only\naffect teenage girls, I felt\nthat I was the only person\nwho could possibly be\nwalking around in this\nposition. I was embarrassed to admit how much\nit was impacting my work,\nmy relationships and my\nenjoyment of university.\nWhen I did reach out for\nhelp, I would categorically\nrefuse to tell any member\nof staff, mental health first\naider or university counsellor that I had an eating\ndisorder. It was a secret I\nguarded very closely until\nthe hold anorexia had was\nso strong that it became\nnoticeable to my close\nfriends.\nSometimes waiting for\na doctor\u2019s appointment\nor a counselling appointment can be too long. I\nfound charity helplines or\nmessage boards were able\nto give me in-the-moment\nsupport until my next\nappointment. Relapse is\na part of recovery; every\nrelapse back to poor\nbehaviour with food felt\nlike another failure. When\nI did relapse, the BEAT\nmessage boards or Samaritans phoneline helped me\nget back on the right road\nmuch quicker than waiting\nfor an appointment with a\ncounsellor. Even if it were\njust a reminder of why I\nwanted to get better in the\nfirst place.\n\u201cNot all eating\ndisorders are\nabout weight\nloss and the\nmajority of\neating disorder\nsufferers are\nnot underweight\u201d\nNow, I\u2019m not saying\nthat A-levels or Imperial\ngave me an eating\ndisorder. What they did\nwas contribute to the\nlack of control that I\nwas already feeling due\nto events in my own\npersonal life. Whether my\nperfectionism put me at\na \u2018predisposition\u2019 for an\neating disorder is neither\nsomething I dispute, nor\nsomething I can really\nchange. On some levels,\nperfectionism makes me\na good scientist but it\nis unmanageable in this\nenvironment.\nI had to get some\ncontrol back. Eating,\nweight, body shape, that\nwas something I could\ncontrol. Mixed in with\nsome poor self-esteem\n\u201cThere were\ntimes at\nImperial I felt\nvery alone\u201d\nI can\u2019t thank my friends\nenough. My friends\nweren\u2019t there to help solve\nmy problems or advise.\nThey\u2019re not trained to deal\nwith it and nor is it fair for\nthem to have that kind of\npressure. However, they\nwere there in so many\nother ways; they would\nsit with me one-on-one\nbecause having lunch\nin large groups was too\nfrightening, convince me\nto book an appointment\nwith the doctor or take me\nfor coffee before hospital\nappointments I was really\nworried about. Their willingness to support made\nthe road to recovery seem\nalmost doable. I felt like,\neven though no one knew\nhow I felt, I wasn\u2019t alone\nanymore.\nway to relieve the pressure\nand stress I was under.\nThis gave me a release of\ntension and allowed me to\ncope with and take control\nof my anxieties rather than\nhaving to restrict my food\nintake or exercise obses-sively. Getting running\nback under control was a\nhuge hurdle to recovery,\nand keeping it as a way\nto relieve stress and not to\nburn calories is at times a\nstruggle, but it introduced\nme to some great new\nfriends and gave me\na place to process my\nproblems in my own time.\nThe extra endorphins and\nserotonin gave me a little\nboost in my day-to-day\nmood, which anti-de-pressants never managed.\nMost importantly, when I\nfell in love with running, I\nfell out of love with losing\nweight. I began to realise\nI needed to fuel by body.\n\u201cEating\ndisorders\nare about\ncontrol and\nperfection\u201d\nComing from A-levels,\nwhere you are expected\nto obtain >90% in exams\nto get an A* and anything\n\u201cI found\ncharity\nhelplines\nor message\nboards were\nable to give me\nin-the-moment\nsupport until\nmy next\nappointment\u201d\n\u201cThe biggest\nthing that\nhelped my\nrecovery was\nfinding a way\nto relive the\npressure and\nstress I was\nunder\u201d\nFinally, the biggest\nthing that helped my\nrecovery was finding a\n\u201cHowever\nhard it is, the\nmore I started\ntalking, the\neasier it got\u201d\nSix months into my\nsecond degree at Imperial\nand officially half way\nthrough my total time\nspent here, I have learnt\na few important lessons\nabout my mental health.\nFirstly, however hard it is,\nthe more I started talking,\nthe easier it got. Secondly,\neveryone needs a coping\nmechanism; some are far\nbetter than others. Finally,\neven though I don\u2019t know\nanyone else at Imperial\nwith an eating disorder, I\nknow no one else is alone.\n\n"

    "content": "We need an election\nCOMMENT\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nT\nhere have been\nmoments in\nworld politics\nin the past four\nyears where I have been\nsurprised and perturbed\nby the result. Post-election\nhangovers are nearly\nalways the best way to\ndull the immediate pain of\nbeing slapped in the face\nby certain events. At precisely 13:21 on Thursday\n13th\nJune, I read the results\nof the first round of voting\nfor the next Conservative\nleader, and my ACC\nhangover was completely\nruined. It is now obvious\nthat in concert with an\nopposition leader that is at\nbest clueless and at worst,\ncriminally incompetent,\nwe shall have a Prime\nMinister that is, at best,\ncriminally naive, and at\nworst, criminal. I am, of\ncourse, referring to the\nwalking, talking mound\nof piss \u2013yellow thatch that\nis Boris Johnson. I cannot\nwait for their symphony in\nmismanagement.\nIn the first round of\nvoting, The Johnson, as he\nis affectionately known by\nthose that bleed red, white\nand blue and believe that\nthe Empire was a Good\nThing, was able to secure\n114 votes to be Tory\nleader. Jeremy Hunt and\nMichael Gove, Boris\u2019\nnearest competition were\nonly able to obtain 43 and\n37 votes, respectively.\nGove was probably too\nbusy snorting cocaine in\nthe boys\u2019 toilets to garner\nadequate support whilst\nJeremy Hunt\u2019s pro-remain\nstance means that his\ncampaign will be aborted\nbefore he reaches the final\nstages; just not by him.\nThe other candidates,\nsmiling Hannibal Lecter,\nthe depressed Humanities\nteacher, Trump\u2019s best\nfriend and that guy that\nsmoked weed one time,\nare not likely to be able to\nmuster sufficient support\nin the remaining time to\nreach the final stage. It\nis almost a certainty that\nBoris will surpass the 1/3\nof Tory MPs necessary to\nreach the final stage. Here,\nBoris and his opponent,\nwhether it is Gove or\nHunt, will be exposed to\nthe Tory membership that\nwill ultimately decide the\nnext Tory leader.\nBoris\u2019 rabid Brexiteer\nstance, as well as his\nfiscally irresponsible\ntax cut proposals for the\nwealthiest among us will\nalmost certainly resonate\nvery strongly with the\nTory membership. If they\nweren\u2019t already queuing\nup to arthritically cross\nthe box with his name in\nit, then they certainly will\nbe now. It doesn\u2019t matter\nthat these plans are being\nfinanced by a readjusted\nbudget ceiling that was\ncreated to prepare for a\nno-deal Brexit scenario\nand that, in order to\nfinance them long term, it\nwill probably involve tax\ncuts for the rest of us. Most\nof them will already have\nvoted for fiscally irresponsible things before, such\nas errr... Brexit. Boris has\nclearly hit on a winning\nstrategy. Promise unrealistic financial dividends\nand reap the benefits.\nPopulist and dishonest\nas it is, this has certainly\nbeen an effective strategy\nin patrimonial elections\nthroughout history.\nHis competitors, with\ntheir carefully thought\nthrough proposals, reek of\nRemainer fear-mongering\nand expert driven advice.\nThis will not go down\nwell with a membership\nthat wants big, brash, bold\npromises to solve their\nproblems.\nThis is ultimately\nthe fundamental issue\nwith the Tory leadership\nelections so far. 120,000\npeople will get to vote for\nthe Prime Minister that\nwill enact policies beyond\nBrexit. These policies will\nalmost certainly afflict\nthe many to the benefit of\nthe few. The Tory party\nmembership are some of\nthe most rabid Brexiteers\nand free marketeers that\nyou could possibly find.\nI did see the BBC cast\ntious internal civil war\nshould, of course, be per-mitted, in order to provide\nBoris with a cabinet as\nrabid as its membership,\nbut ultimately there is a\nresponsibility to the democratic institutions that\nwe all hold as sacred to\ndo the honourable thing.\nFight it out in the sphere\nof public discourse, not\nthe safe space of the Tory\nmembership.\nCould this man be our next Prime Minister? // Wikimedia\n\u201cI am, of\ncourse,\nreferring to\nthe walking,\ntalking mound\nof piss-yellow\nthatch that is\nBoris Johnson\u201d\nthem as \u201cpassionate about\npolitics\u201d, in an attempt to\nlegitimise the vote, but the\nfacts remain; if this were a\nnational election, promising tax cuts for the richest\nmembers of society would\nprobably be political\nsuicide. However, with the\nmajority of the electorate\u2019s\nvoice comfortably muted,\nthey can press ahead with\nthese promises.\nThe only way in which\nthe results of this election\ncan become legitimate are\nif, following the election\nof Bozza to the post of\nPrime Minister, parliament is dissolved and a\ngeneral election is called.\nThe issue of the proximity\nof Brexit is irrelevant.\n120,000 people should\nnot possess the power\nto dictate the course of a\nnation of millions, where\nwe are, at least nominally,\na democracy.

These have helped to reduce access for the RSF. // Getty Images\nSudan Crisis: An Overview\nPOLITICS\nBiyaser Abuelgasim\nPolitics Writer\nO\nn 19th\nDecember\n2018, hundreds\nof people protested in Atbara\nand several other cities in\nSudan against the rising\ncosts of living and dramatic worsening of economic\nconditions. Even bread,\na commodity we take\nfor granted, tripled in\nprice. The protests spread\nquickly to other cities,\nincluding the capital,\nKhartoum, demanding for\nPresident Omar al-Bashir\nto step down. in 2011, leading to a devaluation of the Sudanese\npound and huge increases\nin inflation. Without\nSouth Sudan\u2019s oil output\nto help strengthen the\nSudanese pound, there\nwas a shortage of cash\nin circulation. People\nwould have to regularly\nqueue for many hours\nfor petrol, bread and to\nsimply withdraw cash\nfrom ATMs.\nBy early January\n2019, deaths were being\nreported in anti-Bashir\nprotests in the city of\nOmdurman. Over 800\nanti-government protesters (opposition leaders,\nactivists and journalists)\nhad been arrested by the\nwidely feared National\nIntelligence and Security\nService (NISS). On 22nd\nFebruary, Bashir declared\na nationwide year-long\nstate of emergency. As Al\nJazeera\u2019s Hiba Morgan\nsaid, the state of emergency gives the \u201cmilitary\nthe right to arrest anybody\nthey deem a threat to\nthe country\u2019s national\nsecurity and economic\ndevelopment.\u201d This\nwould translate to more\nforce being used against\nprotesters.\nuniversities in the\ncities of Khartoum and\nOmdurman, violently\nbeating students with\nsticks.\nOn 6th\nApril, thousands\nprotest outside the army\nheadquarters, which\nalso houses president\nAl-Bashir\u2019s residence.\nThis was organised by the\nSudanese Professionals\nAssociation (SPA), a\nunion which has taken an\nincreasingly prominent\nrole in these anti-govern-ment protests.As the sit-in\nat the military headquarters continued throughout\nthe week, social media\nwas blocked and the\npower was cut all over\nSudan. Over the weekend,\nthe rapid reaction force\nof the secret services was\ntrying to attack protestors\ncoming from the north\nand the army took the side\nof the protestors and fired\nback. This resulted in six\ndeaths, 57 injuries and\n2500 arrests in the capital.\nOn 11th\nApril, the army\nannounced that Bashir\nhas been removed from\npower and detained. It\nwas also declared that\na Transitional Military\nCouncil will be replacing\nBashir for two years. The\nTMC is currently headed\nby career soldier, General\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan,\nafter public pressure\nforced General Awad Ibn\nOuf to resign as leader\nonly one day after the\ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat. On 15th\nApril,\nmarking the tenth day\nof protests outside army\nheadquarters, demonstrators demanded a power\ntransfer to a new civilian\ngovernment. Protest\nleaders announced plans\nto create their own transitional council if the TMC\nrefused to step aside.\nTMC leader, al-Burhan\nmaintained that the\nTMC was \u201ccommitted to\nhanding over power to the\npeople.\u201d However, protest\nleaders did not believe\nthat the military junta was\nserious about transferring\npower to civilians and that\nthe council consisted of\nremnants of al-Bashir\u2019s\nregime. As a result,\nprotests intensified.\nOn 24th\nApril, in\nresponse to the protestors\u2019\ndemands, three military\ncouncil generals submitted their resignations.\nThree days later, an\nagreement was reached\nto form a joint civilian\nmilitary ruling council.\nOn 15th\nMay, a three-year\ntransition period to full\ncivilian administration\nwas agreed. However,\nas both sides wanted to\nhave a majority, talks\nbetween protestors and\nthe military council\nbecame deadlocked with\nno accord on the make-up\nof the ruling body. This\nresulted in the launch of a\ntwo-day national strike to\nput pressure on the ruling\nmilitary to hand over\npower to a civilian-led\nauthority. The SPA encouraged people to show\nup at work but to refrain\nfrom any activity.

General Mohammed\nHamdan Dagalo\n(commonly known as\nHemedti, deputy head of\nthe military council) criticised the strike, saying,\n\u201cthis situation doesn\u2019t\nlead the country forward\u201d\nand that \u201cwe are part of\nthe revolution, without the\narmed forces and without\nthe security apparatus,\nOmar al-Bashir would\nstay in power until now.\u201d\nOn 3rd\nJune, the TMC\u2019s\nsecurity forces, including\nthe Rapid Support Forces\n(RSF, formerly the Janjaweed) led by Hemedti,\nused force to disperse\nthousands camped at the\narmy headquarters. Live\nammunition was used, as\nwell as physical assault\nand sexual violence.\nThis coincided with a\nshutdown of the internet\nimposing a de facto media\nblackout. More than 100\ncivilians were killed and\n750 seriously injured in\nthe Khartoum massacre.\nSecurity forces also\nopened fire on protestors\ninside medical facilities.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) stated\nthat emergency and health\nservices were forced to\nshut down. Tent clinics\nset up to treat wounded\nprotestors were destroyed\nand healthcare workers\nassaulted. Furthermore, at\nleast 40 bodies were found\ndumped in the River Nile\nand many remain missing.\nSudanese political car-toonist, Khalid Albaih,\ndescribed Dagalo as\n\u201cSudan\u2019s version of Saudi\nCrown Prince Mohammed\nbin Salman\u2026young, pow-er-hungry and ruthless.\u201d\nIndeed, one factor behind\nHemedti\u2019s power is his\nsupport from regional\nallies(Egypt,SaudiArabia\nand UAE). According\nto Al Jazeera, Hemedti\nmet with Mohamed Bin\nSalman in May, promising\nto support Saudi Arabia\nagainst Iran and Houthi\nmilitias by continuing to\nsend Sudanese troops.\nTherefore, it would be\nin the prince\u2019s interest to\npreserve a strong relationship with Hemedti. In\naddition to this, Hemedti\nis supported by the\npoliticians who created\nthe infamous Janjaweed,\nwho were responsible\nfor instilling fear into the\nresidents of the Darfur\nregion of Sudan during\nthe major armed conflict\nthere in 2003.\nThe Russian Deputy\nAmbassador Dmitry\nPolyanskiy believed that\nthe proposed statement\nwas unbalanced, something they did not want\nto promote as it could\n\u201cspoil the situation.\u201d After\nthe failure of the Security\nCouncil to reach a mutual\nunderstanding, eight\nEuropean countries stated\nthat they condemned the\nviolent attacks in Sudan\nby Sudanese security\nservices against civilians.\nThese countries included\nBelgium, Britain, France,\nGermany, Italy, Poland,\nThe Netherlands and\nSweden. In a joint state-ment, they urged for an\nagreed transfer of power\nto a civilian government\nas demanded by the\nSudanese people.\nOn 7th\nJune, Ethiopia\u2019s\nPrime Minister Abiy\nAhmed met representatives of both sides in an\nattempt to revive negotiation between Sudan\u2019s\nruling generals and\nprotest leaders. Protest\nmovement delegates who\nmet with Abiy Ahmed\nincluded opposition\npolitician Mohamed\nEsmat and a leader of\nthe Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North\n(SPLM-N), Ismail Jalab.\nEsmat was arrested soon\nafter the meeting and\nJalab was arrested from\nhis own home the following morning. Sudanese\nsecurity forces did not\ngive any reason for these\narrests. Both arrested men\nare leading members of\nthe Alliance for Freedom\nand Change, a coalition\nformed in January 2019\nto bring together the\nSudanese opposition to al-Bashir. They called for the\ncollapse of the al-Bashir\nregime and a transition to\ndemocracy under civilian\nauthority.\nAwol Allo, an Africa\nanalyst, maintained that\nAbiy Ahmed stands a\n\u201cmuch better chance\u201d than\nanyone else in bringing\nSudan\u2019s military rulers\nand protestors together to\nfind a consensual solution\nto the current crisis. Abiy\nis a young reformist\nwho was at the centre of\nrestoring diplomatic ties\nbetween Ethiopia and rival\nEritrea. He has strong relationships with the West,\nwhich has aided political\nreform in Ethiopia. Abiy\nalso has good relations\nwith powerful Gulf states,\nsuch as Saudi Arabia,\nthat have influence over\nSudan\u2019s military.\nOn 11th\nJune, the\nTMC has demanded the\nUnited Nations-African\nUnion Mission in Darfur\n(UNAMID) to hand over\nthe remainder of their\nbases directly to the RSF.\nThe RSF is primarily\ncomposed of Janjaweed\nmilitias, the very reason\nwhy UNAMID exists to\nprotect tens of thousands\nof civilians.\nThe African Union\n(AU) and UN are considering withdrawing\nall the remaining peacekeepers from Darfur\nby June 2020, with the\nmajority being removed\nby December 2019. The\nclosed UNAMID bases\nwere meant to be handed\nover to the government;\nhowever, most of them\nare actually being used\nby the RSF. As stated by\nKumi Naidoo, Secretary\nGeneral of Amnesty\nInternational, a decision\nto close UNAMID would\nplace the lives of these\ncivilians at risk as it\nwould remove their \u201conly\nsafeguard against the government\u2019s scorched earth\ncampaign\u201d. Indeed, on\n11th\nJune, Hemedti\u2019s Janjaweed militias attacked\nthe towns of Dileijj and\nZalingei in Central Darfur\nState. There is currently\nno information on the\nnumber of deaths and\ninjuries.\nSudan has long been\nbeset by conflict. It has\nendured decades of civil\nwar, twenty years of US\nsanctions and an Islamist\nmilitary dictatorship.\nThese current protests are\nnot simply over extortionate bread prices or fuel\nshortages. The Sudanese\npeople are choosing to\nrisk their lives, facing live\nbullets, to fight for democracy under a civilian-led\ngovernment. The number\nof martyrs and injured\ncontinues to grow, and the\nsituation in the hospitals is\ndire.\nI pray for the country\nthat has endured so much\nhardship throughout its\nhistory, the country where\nmost of my family still\nlive, the country where\nmany people have lost\nloved ones to toxic government regimes and the\ncountry that once had such\na bright future. I pray that\nall hope is not lost. I pray\nfor a democratic Sudan.\n\u201cAt least 40\nbodies were\nfound dumped\nin the River\nNile\u201d\nOn 4th\nJune, the SPAannounced that a \u201ccomplete\ncivil disobedience\u201d and\nan \u201copen political strike\u201d\nwould take place in all\nworkplaces in Sudan.\nIn a statement, the SPA\naffirmed that the civil\ndisobedience will \u201cend\nonly when a civilian government announces itself\nin power on state television.\u201d They also encouraged activists to strictly\nfollow the techniques of\nnon-violent resistance in\ntheir campaign of civil\ndisobedience against the\nTMC. Protest leaders\nhave asked civilians to\nremain at home, with\ndemonstrations being no\nlonger possible due to\nthe violent actions of the\nmilitary council. There\nhave been reports of\ngunfire in Khartoum as\nsecurity forces remain\ndistributed throughout the\ncapital.\nAlso on 4th\nJune, China\nblocked a bid at the\nUN Security Council to\ncondemn the killing of civilians and issue an urgent\ncall from world powers to\nput an immediate stop to\nthe violence. According\nto Al Jazeera\u2019s diplomatic\neditor, James Bays, China\nstrongly objected to the\ndraft statement, saying\nthat it was an \u201cinternal\nmatter.\u201d China was\nbacked by Russia, and\nKuwait said the \u201cdraft\nneeded amendments.\u201d\n\n"
