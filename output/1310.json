This year however with a large\nMapping Dissertation project to do\non top of other modules some students have half (8 of 16 modules)\neither to be submitted or examined\nin the week after Christmas.\nDuetomodularweightingifyouare\ndoing the 3 yr BSc course this could\ncount for a third of your degree, with\njust two weeks to \u2018prepare\u2019 (See last\nweeks Felix Front page), whereas\nover the Easter break you can have\nonly a third of your year to do after\na 5 week break. With some modules\nbeing split and run twice (once in\nautumn term and once in spring\nterm) with different students, some\nstudents are at an advantage due to\ntimetabling decisions.\nThe two week break wouldn\u2019t be so\nbad if the department could actually\nproduce an acceptable exam timeta-ble! Initially one exam was due to be\nsat on Monday 3rd (a Bank Holiday!)\n\u2013 surely someone timetabling the\nexams would have seen this! It was\nduly moved but after negotiation\nwith the students involved it couldn\u2019t\nbe timetabled in the exam week\n\u2013 students suggested the Monday\nmorning of the next week when all\nwere free, however the department\nchose to timetable it on the Monday\nlunchtime (see Felix headline two\nweeks ago?) which clashed with\nsome students humanities lectures.\nWhen this was pointed out, they\nwere given the option of sitting the\nexam on the Monday afternoon\n\u2013 this of course clashes with department lectures. The option left to\nstudents is therefore which lecture\nto miss to do an exam!\nThis kind of general incompetence\nis typical of the fluid nature of exams\nand coursework and the lassiez faire\nattitude of staff in our department\nand, as recent articles in Felix have\nshown, other departments across\nthe university. With the rector saying that students shouldn\u2019t be represented on College Council and that\nbritish students aren\u2019t really very\ngood you really have to wonder if\nanyone in this college really cares...\nYours,\nA Disgruntled Rock Hunter\nDear Editor,\nMy name is shumit das and I am\ncurrently finishing my PhD in the\naeronautics department. I graduated from the MEng course in Aero\nin 1997, which is the same course\nthat Mr Stephen Message [see Felix\nfront page, 9 December 2004] is currently in his final year of.\nI would like to respond to the\narticle about Exam stress, in the\ncontext of Aeronautics as I have\npersonally had to go through the\nsame process, along with many previous year groups. I felt the article\nto be an unfair representation of the\nworkings of Aeronautics as a whole.\nThe article was written in a way that\nsuggested the exam timetable had\nbeen altered for this current year\nonly, to make their life difficult. This\nis just not the case.\nMr Message states that \u201cthey are\nnot asking for anything that hasn\u2019t\nbeen given in the past\u201d but that is\nnot true. The 4th year has ALWAYS\nbeen given 2 weeks over christmas\nto revise for the exams. As Prof\nHillier said, it is actually more to\ndo with coordination with subjects\nshared by 3rd year and exchange\nstudents than anything else. Also\n4th year projects (which count for\naround a ninth of the entire course)\nstart almost immediately after\nthe exams. If Mr Message would\nlike less time to do the most critical project of his degree then i\u2019m\nsure he can have more time for the\nexams. Unfortunately then, I am\nsure students would be upset about\nnot having enough time to complete\nthe critical project.\nI am certain that many students\nactually find that the time given for\nfinal exams in Aero is just about\nenough to get the revision done on\ntime, in mind of the fact that the\nexams only count for 40% of the\n4th year \u2013 the coursework counts\n60%. I know that many students also\nget their highest marks during the\ncourse in their 4th year, so I would\nsuggest that the guys just get on\nwith it and hand in a sterling project\nreport and presentation.\nI am proud to have been a CAD\nand Fortran tutor to many of the\ncurrent 4th year in Aeronautics and\nI think that almost all of them know\nme quite well. I would not tell them\nto get on with something if I didn\u2019t\nthink it were reasonable (they are\nfree to challenge me on that point).\nI am sorry that the exams revision\ntime is so short but I know that\nProf Hillier would NOT allow something that was truly unreasonable.\nMANY other years have survived\nand actually gone on to get really\ngood degree marks despite this final\nexam problem. So I do feel that\nStephen Message and his friends\nshould really just get and finish the\nexams the best they can and really concentrate on the final project\nwhich counts for so much more.\nGood luck 4th years!\nCheers\nShumit Das\nPhD Student\nDept of Aeronautics\nDave Edwards, Editor, replies:\nThe article on the difficulties suffered by fourth year aeronautics\nstudents was a fair representation\nof the situation, featuring comments from students, staff and the\ndepartmental representative.\nIt was never suggested that the\ndepartment had aimed to make students\u2019 lives difficult; rather, it was\nmade clear that this year\u2019s unusual\nCollege term dates were a major\nfactor.\nIn each of the past four years,\nstudents have had at least three\nweeks over the Christmas break to\nrevise for exams. It follows that the\npresent situation is highly unusual\nand Stephen Message was entirely\ncorrect in saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking\nfor anything that hasn\u2019t been given\nin the past\u201d.\nMr Message was by no means the\nonly student to raise a complaint\nabout this issue. Revising for six 20-lecture courses in two weeks would\nseem to be an extremely difficult\ntask.\nOur \u2018disgruntled rock hunter\u2019\nalso finds him/herself in an unenviable position this week. I would\nencourage any student with similar problems to make their views\nknown to their departmental representative and/or to the Union\u2019s\nDeputy President (Education and\nWelfare) at dpew@ic.ac.uk. Some\npeople don\u2019t care, but others do,\nand change really is possible in\nthe future if enough students make\ntheir voices heard.\nBabar Ahmad\nDear Editor,\nThe Union also campaigns against\ntop-up fees, which is inherently\npolitical. In that case, they use the\nreasoning that it affects students\ndirectly, and campaigning is thus jus-tified. In the case of Babar Ahmed, it\nalso affects a student directly, and\nis thus similarly justified. As a pes-simist, I have my doubts that the\ncampaign will have any impact, but\nI am proud of the fact that it is being\nfought, and believe very strongly\nthat it is necessary to fight it.\nFederhirn\nThe difference is that top up fees\ndirectly affects students at the\ncollege. When Babar Ahmad was\narrested he was no longer a student\nof Imperial College. He was not even\na member of staff as he had left by\nthe time he was arrested. The union\nis not there to support everyone that\nhas been a student in the past.\nThere are several outside organisations that are campaigning on Mr\nAhmad\u2019s behalf, and I do not see\nwhy it was deemed necesary to drag\nICU into the issue when our effect\nwill be minimal and the majority\nof students are not in favour of it.\nIt is worth noting that the union\ncannot legally spend any money on\nthe campaign either and seeing as\nSabbs are paid as soon as they give\nany time to it we have spent money\non it. All in all, its a bit of a mess up\nand I predict not a lot will happen\nas a result.\nChris J\nTheUSextraditionrequestisnojoke.\nBabar Ahmad has been accused of a\nlong list of terrorist activities includ-ing: operating websites inciting and\nfunding terrorism and planning an\nattack similar to that of US Cole in\nthe gulf. The list goes on.\nIf it is a question between Babar\nAhmad being released or imprisoned without a trial pending extra-dition, while it may seem unjust\nhe must be kept in prison. While\nit has become all too trendy to be\nhighly cynical of our government\u2019s\nanti-terror campaign, at the end of\nthe day it boils down to a matter of\ntrust. Do you trust the government?\nThe world is not perfect, and at the\nend of the day if the only way of\nkeeping us safe is for the government to incarcerate a few terrorism suspects without trials / formal\ncharges, so be it. Surely the human\nright for someone not be blown up is\ngreater than that of someone not to\nbe locked up.\nWhile all the above to some extent\nis debatable, the following is not:\nThe Union has no right to campaign for his release. The union is\nnot elected under political grounds.\nThere is no way of checking whether\nthe council\u2019s views are representative of the college in general.\nUnlike tuition fees, where the\nunion could presume to have the\nunanimous support of the college,\nhere they cannot. This is not specifically a student issue. The union\nwould not be acting democratically.\nThe union represents all of us. All\nofusdonotsupportthisissue.Unless\nthe union could prove through some\nreferendum that a sizable majority backed this issue, or any other\npolitical issue for that matter, it cannot champion this cause.\nIt sounds to me like a weak willed\ncouncil bowed into intimidation...\nTR\nPlease note that article 30 of the universal declaration of human rights\nstates that no human rights can be\nused as an excuse to violate others.\nThe idea that the right to life comes\nbefore the human rights of a suspect\nhence stands in direct conflict with\nthe universal declaration of human\nrights.\nThe reason why the declaration is\ncorrect here, is in my mind, twofold:\n- cruelty is never justified from a\nmoral perspective\n- going against human rights\nincreases the risk of terrorism, as\nthe hearts and minds of muslim\ncommunities here and eslewhere is\nlost, and terror recruitment increas-es. We are seeing this at this very\nmoment.\nOn the contrary, a more honourable and level-headed approach, i.e.\ncharging when there is evidence\nand using surveillance whilst gathering evidence, would better serve\nto protect the citizens safety and\nideals.\nWe cannot judge the veracity of\nthe charges against Babar, but the\nwell-tried rule of law entails a due\nlegal process that can. Babar should\nbe either freed or charged in such a\nprocess.\nIt is reasonable for the union to be\ninvolved as Babar and, not unlikely,\nother Imperial students/staff are\naffected.\nHence I support this important\ncampaign, both for Babar and for\nsociety as a whole.\nOscar Dahlsten\n\u25cf These comments on\nBabar Ahmad are taken from\nwww.felixonline.co.uk. Visit the website for more discussion and debate.\nCSFB reorganisation\nSir,\nNumaan Chaudry journalsim\nregarding the re-organiseation of\nCSFB makes a mockery of Felix\u2019s\nattempt to offer business news.\nFirstly, to suggest that prospective\ninterns should not consider the firm\nindicates total lack of research into\nthe matter. CSFB remains a leading\nplayer in the industry, indeed only\nyesterday it was appointed advisor to\nTelecom Italia Mobiles in the $27bn\ndollar buyout of the remainning 44%\nnot held buy Telecom Italia. It may\ninterest him to know that Goldman\nSachs has been retained solely to\noffer a \u201cfairness opinion\u201d. In terms\nof layoffs, two to three hundred are\nset to go, which from an organisation of 16,000+ is hardly a blood let-ting, futhermore CSFB is still widely\nhiring and paying in line with the\nrest of the street, indeed total of 25\nnew investment banking analysts\nwere hired into the London office for\n2004, with the number of new hires\nfor 2005 set to be 35.\nI would argue that his lackadasical\napproach to journalism has served\nonly to undermine the position of\none of the worlds leading securities\nhouses in one of the world leading\ntalent pools, which is disappoint-ing, and hopefully not indicative of\nthe standards of the journalism that\nFelix hopes to espouse.\nSincerely,\nCharles Cassidy\nNumaan Chaudhry, Business Editor,\nreplies:\nPlease tell me where I have undermined CSFB\u2019s strength as a global\nleader, its number one rankings\nor indeed the strength of the above\ndivisions (equity research, securities origination).\nLet me make it clear; I am well\naware of CSFB\u2019s position and\ngrowing prowess in many divisions within investment banking.\nNow I assume that because of your\naffiliation with CSFB, whatever\nthat may be, you are a professional\nand I was expecting you to voice\nyour opinions in a less extremist\nfashion. Overloooking that, let me\nnow get to the crux of the issue.\nThe fact of the matter is, and no\ndoubt any linguistics expert will\nsupport my view, that when I said\n\u2018reconsider your options\u2019, the context in which this is said makes it\nclear that students should reconsider whether they should be applying\nto these divisions; CSFB\u2019s reputation has been left untainted.\nI expect this clears up the confusion and hope that you have\nthe courage to apologise for your\nunjustified use of \u2018mockery\u2019 to Felix\nvolunteers.\nFinally, in any future correspond-ence, could I ask that you address\nme properly by spelling my surname correctly.\nLetters to the Editor\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk. This is the page where you can make your voice heard on just about any topic.\nLetters may be edited for length but not for spelling or grammar, and are printed at the Editor\u2019s discretion\n\n"

No-one could outrun this wave or save their\nsweetheart, there was no dramatic music, and the leaders\nof the world did not all rally\nround immediately. Science\ndid not win the day, and there\nwas no early warning system\nto limit the number of victims.\nThe wave just quietly rolled\non and on, sweeping up everything in its path.\nJack Straw, the Foreign\nSecretary, said that 199\nBritons are \u201chighly likely\u201d to\nhave died in the disaster. Mr\nStraw added that \u201cmany of\nthe bodies of the dead may\nnever be found\u201d. Kofi Annan,\nthe United Nations Secretary\nGeneral, said that affected\nareas could take up to ten\nyears to recover.\nImperial College students\nand their families may well\nhave been affected by the\ntsunami, as the College has\nsignificant numbers of students from several of the\naffected countries, including Sri Lanka, India and\nThailand. However, with tens\nof thousands of people still\nmissing and the spring term\nonly just begun, it is impossible to judge the disaster\u2019s\nimpact on the Imperial population at this stage.\nThe tsunami was caused\nby the biggest earthquake\nfor 40 years, which occurred\nbetween the Australian and\nEurasian plates of the Earth\u2019s\ncrust. A series of huge waves\nthen spread across a large\nportion of the Indian Ocean.\nThe worst affected countries\nwere Indonesia \u2013 with over\n94,000 confirmed dead \u2013 and\nSri Lanka.\n\u25cf Donate online to the\nTsunami Earthquake\nAppeal at dec.org.uk\n\u25cf Forces of nature: how\ntsunamis form, page 7\n\u25cf Science, religion and\nhistory repeated, page 7\nIndian Ocean struck by one of\nworld\u2019s worst natural disasters\nTwo of the many scenes of devastation caused by the\nrecent Indian Ocean tsunami\nBy Tom Simonite\nScience writer\nThe human cost of the\nsubmarine earthquake on\nBoxing Day is still being\ncounted. No-one was\nexpecting the quake or the\nsubsequent wall of water,\nbut thousands of lives could\nhave been saved if an early\nwarning system had been\nin place.\nWhile earthquakes are\nimpossible to predict, it is\npossible to implement systems that provide immediate information on their\nseverity and an advance\nwarning of tsunamis.\nThere are two key components to such systems:\ninstruments to monitor\nquakes and tsunamis, along\nwith a framework able to\ncommunicate the necessary\nwarnings to the local governments of those at risk.\nThe Indian Ocean lacks\nboth.\nRicher nations around the\nPacific Basin do have such a\nsystem \u2013 26 member states\nbelong to the Tsunami\nWarning System (TWS).\nSeismological and tidal stations throughout the Pacific\nprovide data on quakes with\nthe potential to cause tsu-namis, and any that are pro-duced. The Pacific Tsunami\nWarning Center (PTWC)\nnear Honolulu, Hawaii, provides tsunami warnings to\nnational authorities in the\nPacific Basin.\nCriteria of location and\nmagnitude of an earthquake\nare used to predict whether\na tsunami is likely. A warning is issued in the form of\npredicted arrival times of\nthe wave at selected coastal communities within the\ngeographic area defined by\nthe maximum distance the\ntsunami could travel in a\nfew hours. Less specific\nwarnings and timings are\nissued for an area defined\nby the distance the tsunami\ncould travel in a subsequent\ntime period. If equipment\nmonitoring sea levels actually detects a tsunami wave\nthen a wider warning is\nissued to the entire Pacific\nBasin.\nIssuing the necessary\ninformation to national\nauthorities is only the beginning of a successful warn-ing. Governments need to\nbe able to coordinate the\nevacuation of people at risk\nquickly. Members of the\nTWS, particularly richer\nnations, have managed to\ndo this. Pacific states of the\nUS have tsunami sirens in\nplace to warn the public.\nJapan has been able to rapidly and effectively evacuate populations at risk in\nresponse to warnings issued\nby the PTWC.\nThe non-existence of similar systems in the Indian\nOcean has not been a secret.\nUN-approved plans to place\nnew monitoring equipment\nin the Indian Ocean have\nfaltered due to a delay in\nthe necessary funding, and\nthe poverty of the nations in\nthe region. A lack of political harmony between these\ncountries has also been\ncited as hampering the\ninception of a warning system that could have saved\nmany lives.\nNow, in the wake of the\nstill-unfolding tragedy, leaders of the affected countries\nand from the wider international community are committing to ensuring that an\nearly warning system is created for the Indian Ocean.\nSadly, it will be too late for\nthe tens of thousands of\nvictims of the Boxing Day\ndisaster.\nEarly warning\nsystem could\nhave saved lives\nBy Emily Gwyer\nIn the aftermath of the worst\nhumanitarian distaster in\nrecent times, what can be\ndone to help those affected\nand prevent similar occurrences in the future?\nWell, many of us have\nalready done it \u2013 donate\nmoney at www.dec.org.uk or\nat a collection box. We can\nsend clothes and household\nthings to Oxfam, who will\ndeliver them to people who\nhave lost everything.\nWe can rail against George\nBush and Tony Blair, who\ndo not see the worst disaster for centuries to be reason\nenough to interrupt their holi-days. Indeed, this has already\nbeguninAmerica,wherethere\nwas outcry over the original\noffering, which was half the\namount the Republicans plan\nto spend on Bush\u2019s inaugu-ration. The amount donated\nby the British public shamed\nour government after Tony\nBlair\u2019s pathetic original offering of \u00a31m was donated every\nhour by the public.\nWe can demand that the\nmoney promised by the world\nactually gets there \u2013 aid agencies warned this week that\nwestern governments have\nan unfortunate habit of promising millions and then forgetting to deliver them.\nWe can push for early warning systems to be put in place\nall around the world. If such\na system had been in place in\nIndonesia, the vast majority\nof lives lost would have been\nsaved \u2013 the wave took an hour\nand a half to reach land. And\nalthough 80% of tsunamis\noccur in the Pacific Ocean,\nwe should not be complacent\n\u2013 we need to set up a system\ntoo. Just in case. Being overcautious doesn\u2019t seem so bad\nnow, does it?\nWe can carry on visiting the\naffected countries, which will\nneed our money more than\never in the next few years.\nWe can pray for the survivors and the families of the\ndead, and hope that nothing\nlike this ever happens again.\nWhat can we do now?\nBy Chris Jackson\nRAG Chair\nIn response to the worldwide appeal, many clubs and\nsocieties as well as individuals at Imperial have mobilised to raise funds and offer\nassistance to the victims of\nthe tsunami.\nRAG and City and Guilds\nhave combined resources to\nco-ordinate activities across\nthe campus, so that clubs and\nsocieties can concentrate on\ncollecting money.

The standard\nbunch of criminals showed\nup on behalf of Warwick,\nincluding a prepubescent\nCanadian.\nThe match started with a\nbump, and before a goal was\nscored, the first of three fights\nbroke out. Carlos was cowardly rammed from behind\nagainst the wall, and justly\nretaliated. The Warwick players\u2019 strength was in numbers,\nand two of them joined the\nfray against the IC Devil.\nHowever, the Devils decided\nthat it was (a) a long way\nto go for a punch up, (b)\nCarlos didn\u2019t need any help,\nand (c) Carlos didn\u2019t deserve\nany help, so they stood back\nand watched the ramming\ndevelop until the King Sized\nRef separated them with a\ncrowbar. Carlos earned himself five golden minutes in the\npenalty box for his efforts, as\ndid the Warwick player.\nThe game was scrappy, with\nthe Panthers using every dirty\ntrick in their very dirty book\nof filthy tricks, and due to\nsome ambiguous offside calls\nthey managed to sneak in two\ngoals on the break (then they\ngot a few more).\nThis led to the valiant Devils\nbeing 5-0 down at the end of\nthe period. The second period\nsaw a great start for the\nDevils, with a blinding strike\nfrom Ilya at an unbelievable\nangle pulling one back for the\ngood guys. However, proving\nthat there is no fairness in\nthis life, the Panthers scored\na few more, before the next\nfight broke out. Yingke had\nhis head smacked into the\nice, and despite cries of \u201cdon\u2019t\nretaliate [and kick their heads\nin]\u201d, his honour was tarnished\nand needed to be regained.\nThe subsequent action saw\na few more players involved,\nand after bashing them off,\nthe referee sent Yingke off for\na well-earned rest.\nThe third period lead to\nanother goal by the IC Devils\nteam, scored from point\nby Tom Andrews, but the\nPanthers did get a few more,\nleaving the final score at 12-2\nin their favour.\nCongratulations must go to\n(wo)man of the match Ruth\nC, the \u2018keeper, and also to\nanyone who played for the\nfirst time, goalscorers, and\nespecially Carlos for spending more time in the penalty\nbooth than everyone else in\nthe building combined.\nIf you are interested in\njoining the ice hockey team,\nor just want to come and\nsupport us (anyone is wel-come) then email us at\nice-hockey@ic.ac.uk.

I was perhaps the 20th\nperson to stand here and see\nthe colours, the shapes and\nthe sheer scale of this enormous stone cathedral, every\nlast facet of it formed by water\nand gravity.\nConnecting me to the world\nabove, and leading ever deep-er, were hundreds of lengths\nof rope secured by literally\nhammering into the rockface\n\u2013 years of effort by students\nfrom ICCC and the Slovenian\nJSPDT.\nI could just see the faint\norange light of my caving\nbuddy 70m above me. I built a\ncairn of rocks as a substitute\nfor a tripod, and balanced my\nold Soviet camera at an angle\nI hoped would cover the whole\npitch. Dousing my light and\nopening the shutter, I shouted\n\u201crope free!\u201d\nI sat absolutely still (so as\nnot to to nudge the camera)\nin the perfect darkness for\n15 minutes and watched the\nimpossibly small orange dot\nabove me float down as gently\nas a feather, with the lightning\nblue flash burning an image\ninto my retina every minute\nor two. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever\nfelt quite so peaceful, quietly\nbiding my time sitting on a\nshelf of rock surrounded by\nmoonscape.\nAfter packing the camera\nand eating some chocolate,\nwe readied for the ascent \u2013\n400m of rope to climb, nearly\nfive times the height of the\nQueen\u2019s Tower. Over eight\nhours of solid climbing later, I\nfinally flopped out of the cave\nand sniffed at the strange\nozone smell of the vegetation,\ngazing up at the star-framed\nsilouttes of the mountains\nacross the valley.\nMy buddy, who had been\ndilligently waiting at the bottom of pitches as I climbed\nin case I struck difficulty (not\nonce grumbling as he read\n120 pages of his paperback\nsitting in the cold), joined me\nafter a few short minutes. We\nstumbled back to the Bivvi following the string as it snaked\naround the many hazards on\nthe plateau. I was so utterly\nexhausted that I had to be\nhelped out of my caving kit,\nbut was soon warmed by the\nfire and refreshed with hot\nchocolate and plates of chilli.\nThe photo came out and is\nreproduced here (right) \u2013 a\nsnapshot to illustrate a single day\u2019s experiences while\non expedition with the caving club. There is no way to\nsqueeze the many activities\nenjoyed during four weeks in\nSlovenia into a single article,\nbut I hope that this tiny sliver\nmay kindle your interest.\nAbout the Club\nAs enormously taxing as the\nsport is, both physically and\npsychologically, caving is\nneither competitive nor\nmacho. The aim is to use\npeople\u2019s different skills in\ncooperation to further common goals of exploration and\nenjoyment. No prior experience is required and all training is done within the club,\ndrawing on the experience\nof our mature members. All\ntrips are tailored to the skills\nand wishes of those taking\npart, and you will never be\nasked to do things that you\nare unhappy with or that we\ndo not feel you are ready for\nyet.\nImperial College Caving\nClub runs regular weekend\ntrips to caving destinations\naround the UK, usually costing \u00a325 to \u00a330 inclusive of all\ntraining, equipment, trans-poration, accomodation, food\nand leadership. As well as\nour summer expedition to\nSlovenia, we have a week-long\ntour during the Easter break\nto somewhere warm and long\nweekends to destinations\naround Europe in the spring\nand summer.\nWe meet weekly on\nTuesdays in Southside upper\nlounge from 7.30pm and\npractice rope-climbing in the\ntrees in Princes Gardens on\nWednesday afternoons from\n1pm. Drop by at some point\nfor a chat and we\u2019ll do our\nbest to answer any questions\nthat you have.\nBrowse our large pho-toarchive, read trip reports\nand keep up with the latest\nnews at www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/rcc/caving or email\nic.caving@gmail.com.\nCAVING CLUB\nGoing underground in Slovenia\nClewin Griffith descending Concorde pitch, Gardener\u2019s World, Slovenia\nThe Caving Club in Yorkshire, ready to go underground\nPHOTO: JARVIST FROST\nBy David Horton\nThursday 24 February 2005\nwill mark the first meeting of\nwhat is hoped will eventually\nbecome the revived Imperial\nCollege Railway Society\n(ICRS).\nI say \u2018revived\u2019 because it\nseems that the ICRS never\nofficially died. It is not known\nexactly why or when the society disbanded, folded or just\nfaded away, but according to\nthe archives (predominant-ly the surviving club tank-ard), its last president was\n\u2018inscribed\u2019 in 1981.\nA brief history of the\nclub\nThe earliest evidence of the\nsociety so far discovered\ndates from 1956. They had\ntheir own magazine, Review,\ntheir own constitution and\neven their very own steam\nlocomotive named \u2018Dymphna\u2019\nwhich was run on occasional\nSundays at a club track in\nWest London (the search continues to find this train, and if\nanybody knows of its current\nwhereabouts, please contact\nthe author!)\nFar from being a trainspotters\u2019 club (\u2018trainspotting\u2019 then\na socially acceptable hobby\nlike any other, now almost\nuniversally viewed as tantamount to mental illness),\nthe society had a truly varied social calendar for those\ninterested in railways. Events\nincluded talks by eminent figures in the industry, site vis-its, volunteer weekends and\nmain line excursions.\nRevival\nTwo members of staff here at\nImperial College \u2013 Kim Winter\nand John Barnes \u2013 rediscovered the ICRS through their\nlinks to the narrow-gauge\nFfestiniog Railway in North\nWales and decided to attempt\na revival. I met them through\nalmost pure luck, and together we have now got the ball\nrolling.\nMembers!\nOn Thursday 24 February\n(6.45pm, room 342 Mechanical\nEngineering), we invite YOU\n\u2013 any interested person, stu-dent, staff or alumnus \u2013 to\ncome and attend our first\nmeeting. Our guest speaker\nwill be Adrian Shooter, chairman of Chiltern Railways.\nAmongst the post-privati-sation train operating companies (TOCs), Chiltern\nRailways is a relatively \u2018small\nfish\u2019 but has been highly suc-cessful, both financially and\noperationally. There can be\nfew people more qualified to\ntalk about \u2018running a successful railway company\u2019. More\ndetails will emerge nearer\nthe time, but it would be great\nto get as much support as\npossible. This is where our\nappeal hinges.\nAny club or society wishing to be officially recognised\nneeds at least 20 people to\nput their names to paper\n(and preferably more). You\ndon\u2019t have to book a place\nat the lecture, but if you are\ninterested in attending and\nbecoming a member, I would\nlike to hear from you! Having\nthose all-important 20 signatures also enables us to\nobtain a small advertising\nbudget specifically to boost\nthe inception of this society.\nIf you are interested, please\nemail me as soon as possible\nat david.horton@ic.ac.uk.\nRAILWAY SOCIETY\nMembers sought for revival of Railway Society\n\n"

    "content": "I realise that this review is a little on\nthe late side, but I wouldn\u2019t want to\ndeprive people of these, albeit brief,\nreflections on the Imperial College\nUnion Choir\u2019s concert at the end of\nlast term.\nThe concert was something of a\nnew experience for me, as I was\nsitting in the audience this time\ninstead of being up on the stage with\nmy fellow ladies of the alto section.\nThe choir is vast, and in all honesty what people say about things\nsounding completely different away\nfrom the source of the sound is true\n\u2013 only in the audience can you fully\nappreciate the sound of each section and the way they overlap and\ninteract in the interpretation of the\nmusic.\nThe concert began in jubilant\nfashion with the Hallelujah from\nBeethoven\u2019s Mount of Olives. A wonderfully fun piece to sing, I remember enjoying it greatly. The choir\nlooked confident and as though they\nwere enjoying themselves, and the\nmood carried over into the audi-ence. A very successful way to start\nthe concert.\nSome Bach followed in the form\nof the Magnificat. Bach is always\nwonderful; the man was a gen-ius, his music flows with glorious\nlayers of sound from all quarters\n\u2013 the orchestra, the soloists and\neach section of the choir all have\ntheir chance to shine. Again the\nperformance was confident. There\nwere a few moments of restrained\npanic when the music\u2019s deviousness\nalmost requires it, but nothing dire.\nThe tenor section did themselves\nproud \u2013 rather lacking in numbers,\nthey definitely made themselves\nheard (which can be attributed to\ntheir, some would say, overpowering\negos, however I\u2019ll leave this to the\nreader\u2019s own opinion).\nA word on the acoustics of the\nGreat Hall and the size of the choir\nare appropriate at the point. At some\npoint in one\u2019s career at Imperial, one\nmust spent some time in the Great\nHall for one reason or another. I\nthink that we would all agree that\nthe place is large and not the most\nbeautiful of spaces. (At this point I\nmust apologise to my Russian class\nas they\u2019ve all been privy to this\nparticular rant.) The Great Hall has\nabsolutely no acoustic \u2013 it has the\nunique ability to crush any sound\ntrying to make its way from one\nregion to the next. This unfortunate\neffect is most harmful to singers\u2019\nefforts. Soloists sing their hearts\nout only to have at most half of what\nthey are trying to convey reach the\naudience.\nThe choir, while it is admirable\nthat so many people want to sing, is\nnow almost too large; the bass section is now set so far back from the\naudience that, at times, between the\ndistance and the Great Hall effect,\nyou almost miss them, particularly when they are singing lower in\ntheir voices, which is a shame. The\nsopranos, on the other hand, the\nlargest section in the choir, at times\ncompletely overpower the rest. Yes,\nmore often than not they have the\ntune, but there is a lot more going\non in the music that one would benefit from hearing.\nFollowing a brief interval, the\nchoir capped off their concert with\nMozart\u2019s Requiem. The Requiem\nwas never completed by Mozart\nhimself, and so it has been the task\nof others over centuries to try to\nfathom what he meant to do. The\nversion of the score performed by\nthe choir was the latest \u2018completion and updating\u2019 by Robert Levin,\nand had some interesting changes\nfrom that which we are used to\nhearing. The various \u2018updatings\u2019 of\nthe score do not change the melo-dies, but rather, for the most part,\nmake subtle changes to the orches-tration.\nAgain, the performance was\nconfident and at times the choir\nwere clearly enjoying themselves.\nHowever, by this point in the concert\nthe taxing nature of the programme,\nand perhaps also the overzealous\nnature of some singers, was definitely beginning to tell in the tenor\nsection which at times sounded\nhoarse.\nJust a quick note on the soloists,\nbefore I finish; for the most part\nthey were wonderful, but there was\none weak link. The soprano, tenor\nand bass were all great, in fact the\nsoprano was truly awe-inspiring,\nbut the alto was altogether another\nmatter, sounding completely out\nof place when she wasn\u2019t drowned\nout.\nThe choir gave a good performance of rather varied pieces, showing that they can do the whole range\nfrom jubilant forte to solemn piano,\nnot to mention stay together while\nfollowing the conductor\u2019s breakneck speeds in fugues.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nJerusalem from the Mount of Olives, by Frederic Edwin Church\n\u201cBach is always\nwonderful; the man\nwas genius\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 6 January 2005 15\nICU Choir\nFriday 10 December 2004\nGreat Hall\nBeethoven, Bach, Mozart\nBeethoven, Bach and Mozart\nBetter late than never: ICU Choir\u2019s concert just before Christmas\nQuite a lot of ramblings this week... it has been a while, humour me\nA few words on some other arts-related topics before I declare that\nI\u2019ve said what I\u2019m going to say this\nweek. I\u2019ll start off with opera, and go\nvia a couple of exhibitions to a novel\ntreatment of opera.\nThe Royal Opera recently did a run\nof performances of Donizetti\u2019s opera\nbuffa, a comedy, Don Pasquale,\nDonizetti\u2019s most famous opera being\nthe somewhat more serious Lucia\ndi Lammermoor which was performed last season. This particular outing of a Donizetti opera was\ngiven something of a mixed, and\nconfusing, reception, especially by\nThe Times.\nThe Times, for reasons known only\nto its editors, chooses Don Pasquale\nas one of their arts events not miss\none Sunday, then runs a review\nberating everything about the per-formance, and then the next week\nis once again full of praise for the\nopera.\nFortunately, I had booked tickets to\nsee for myself (it was a tough choice;\nsee some amusing Donizetti or some\ntragic Puccini with Gheorghiu). I\nfound the performance to be thoroughly enjoyable and very funny.\nThe highly unfavourable review\nhad said that there was absolutely\nnothing amusing about the Royal\nOpera\u2019s production, the cast being\nabout as amusing as watching paint\ndry. All I can say is that the reviewer\nobviously lacked a sense of humour\nor had perhaps suffered a similar\nfate as the eponymous Don. The\nproduction was cleverly designed,\nthe action being set in an over-sized\ndolls\u2019 house, and every word could\nbe understood and their meanings\nclearly conveyed by the cast. Unjust\naccusations were also levelled at\nthe singers portraying Norina and\nErnesto. Making her debut at the\nHouse, Tatiana Lisnic was most definitely up to the standards expected\nby the patrons and, quite frankly,\nJuan Diego Florez, a Peruvian tenor,\nhas one of the most beautiful voices\naround \u2013 he may not have the power\nof some of his fellow tenors but\nhis voice carried perfectly well and\ntechnically he was very strong.\nTwo exhibitions are about to close\nhere in town, and should you get\nthe chance they ought to be seen.\nFirstly, there is the Raphael show\nat the National Gallery. This may be\nyour only chance to see so much by\nthe artist in one place \u2013 of course,\ntravelling throughout the world to\nsee the individual pieces of the collection at the galleries from whence\nthey came would be highly enjoy-able, but in the spirit of practicality\nwhy not see it all at once?\nSecondly, there is a lovely little\nexhibition in the Sackler Wing of\nthe Royal Academy of the work of\nthe British artist William Nicholson,\na review of which will appear next\nweek. You will probably recognise\nhis print of Queen Victoria and some\nof those from his series of the alpha-bet, but his work is not restricted to\nthis medium \u2013 a number of paintings are also featured. If you don\u2019t\nfancy seeing something quite as\n\u2018mainstream\u2019 as the Raphael, the\nNicholson is rather interesting.\nNow, briefly back to opera. I think\nit\u2019s quite obvious that I love the\nopera, as was picked up by my family this Christmas. The most curious\nitem of opera paraphernalia that I\nreceived was a set of comic book\nopera adaptations from my brother.\nWhile the selection of operas in the\ncollection is a little on the eccentric\nside, those that have been included\nhave received a very good treat-ment. So, for anyone thinking about\ngoing to the opera for the first time,\nor, I think more usefully, for someone who is trying to convince someone to go, this particular treatment\nmay have more success in generating interest than a copy of Kobb\u00e9\u2019s.\nThe colourful pictures are somewhat more enticing than the very\ndetailed but slightly dry information\ncontained in this rather heavy tome,\n(though I do recommend Kobb\u00e9 for\nlater use, as almost everything is\ncovered there).\nPAOLA SMITH\nARTS EDITOR\n\n"

    "content": "Happy new year from all at Felix\nWelcome to the first Felix of 2005.\nI hope you managed to make the\nmost of the short Christmas break.\nThe tsunami\nWhere to begin? I can only offer\nmy condolences to anyone reading\nthis who has been affected in any\nway by the tragic aftermath of the\nearthquake in the Indian Ocean on\nBoxing Day.\nOn pages 2 and 7, we have done\nour best to give suitable coverage to\nan issue that has, quite rightly, been\nalmost the sole focus of media attention for over a week. It may be several weeks before we learn whether\nor not any Imperial College students\nor their families were in the area at\nthe time. We offer our deepest sympathy to any reader with relatives\nwho have died or are still missing.\nIt is particularly tragic that, had\nthe tsunami struck richer nations\nwith early warning systems instead\nof poorer countries without such\naids, thousands of lives could have\nbeen saved.\nIt was pleasing, however, to see\nstudents starting Imperial\u2019s fundraising effort before the term had\neven begun. We will be filling up a\ncollection tin in the Felix office and\ncovering fundraising events around\nCollege as they happen. Turn to\nChris Jackson\u2019s article on page 2 to\nfind out how you can get involved.\nBabar Ahmad\nIn the morning of Tuesday 2\nDecember 2003, I received a tip-off\nabout an incident in the mechanical engineering building. I went\nover and discovered that a room\nwas being secured and searched\nby police officers. A member of\nImperial College staff had been\ntaken into custody. On the same day,\nthe Metropolitan Police confirmed\nthat four men had been arrested\nin south west London and detained\n\u201con suspicion of involvement in the\ncommission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism\u201d.\nWe broke the news on the Felix\nwebsite that afternoon. Other news\norganisations would soon take up\nthe story, which continues to this\nday. The man arrested was Babar\nAhmad, a former student and staff\nmember at Imperial College, whose\nsituation is now the subject of a\nUnion campaign.\nThis matter has generated a considerable amount of debate, not\nleast at December\u2019s meeting of\nUnion Council. Should our students\u2019\nunion come to the aid of a former\nImperial student and staff mem-ber, who many believe has suffered\nterribly at the hands of the police\nand the Government? Or should we\nsteer clear of issues like this and\nonly concentrate on matters directly\naffecting our current members as\nstudents of the College? Convincing\narguments can be made by both\nsides. Conflicting opinions appear\non this week\u2019s Letters page (page\n10), while Colin Smith (below) gives\nmore information about Mr Ahmad\nand the Union\u2019s campaign.\nIt remains to be seen whether\nthe Council\u2019s decision to campaign\nfor Mr Ahmad\u2019s release will have\nany major effect, since several clubs\nand societies would have done so\nanyway. Given his links with the\nCollege, this could prove to be a\nrather unique situation. On the\nother hand, it might set an interesting precedent for the future \u2013 will\nour students\u2019 union be campaigning\non other political or civil liberties\nissues too?\nFelix\nThis term, our plan is to continue\nto take your student newspaper for-ward, bringing you more articles,\nmore detail, more interest and more\nentertainment.\nA new version of our website (www.\nfelixonline.co.uk) will launch very\nsoon, allowing us to improve the\nonline side of the newspaper. Full\ndetails will be announced shortly.\nIf you would like to get involved\nwith Felix, in any capacity, I would\nlike to hear from you. We have\nopportunities in all areas, though we\nespecially need reviewers and proofreaders at the moment. If you\u2019re\ninterested in joining us, email me at\nfelix@ic.ac.uk.\nIf you have any comments or suggestions about Felix, don\u2019t hesitate\nto get in touch. Finally, best wishes\nfor a happy and successful 2005.\nEDITORIAL\nDAVE EDWARDS\nEDITOR\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 6 January 2005 9\nFreeing Babar Ahmad\nAt the last Union Council meeting\nof term, as has been reported on\nthe front page, the Council considered a widely supported motion\n(www.union.ic.ac.uk/meetings/files/\npaper1-179-1497.pdf) to support the\n\u2018Free Babar Ahmad\u2019 campaign at\nImperial College. After a lengthy\ndiscussion and much debate, the\nmotion was passed.\nThis all took place at the most\nwidely attended Council meeting I\ncan remember, with the large audience of students almost unanimously in support of the campaign. There\nwas some controversy surrounding\nthe motion, mainly around whether or not our Union should take a\nstance on issues such as this one.\nI hope that once you have looked\ninto the case, and if you have ever\nsat through the frequent farcical\ndebates that take place at Council\n(something I would wish on very\nfew people indeed) then you, like\nme, will be proud that our Union\nis getting involved with an issue as\nimportant as the defence of Babar.\nThe campaign itself was\nlaunched several weeks before, at\na large meeting hosted by three\nImperial College Union socie-ties: Islamic Society, Imperial\nAgainst Imperialism and Amnesty\nInternational. Over 160 students,\nfrom a wide range of backgrounds,\npacked out a lecture theatre to\nhear Babar\u2019s father, convenor of\nthe Stop the War Coalition Lindsey\nGerman, and Yvonne Ridley talk\nabout the \u2018war on civil liberties\u2019\nsince September 11 2001, in particular with reference to Babar.\nThe speakers talked about Babar\nbeing just one of a huge number of\nMuslims who have been victimised\nin the Government\u2019s attempt to justify their so-called \u2018war on terror\u2019,\nthe disastrous effects of which are\nclearly being felt at home as well\nas in countries like Afghanistan and\nIraq. It is for this reason that I would\nlike to echo the speakers and urge\neveryone to join the forthcoming\ndemonstration in central London on\n19 March, the second anniversary of\nthe start of the war on Iraq.\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t been\nfollowing his case, Babar Ahmad\nwas a former student and member\nof staff at Imperial before he was\narrested under a new extradition\nlaw (which allows suspects to be\nextradited to the US without evidence of their alleged crime) for\nsupposedly being involved with\nterrorist activities. He had been\narrested a year earlier for similar reasons, and released without\ncharge due to lack of evidence, but\nnot before being subjected to what\nhis supporters believe was extreme\nphysical and verbal abuse at the\nhands of police officers. The Union\nhas resolved to support an investigation into this alleged abuse.\nThere is still no evidence against\nBabar, and he is now facing a further violation of his human rights\nas he waits to hear whether he will\nbe extradited to the US, the land of\nthe death penalty and Guantanamo\nBay, in a move that could set an\nextremely dangerous precedent.\nFor more information, visit www.\nfreebabarahmad.co.uk.\nWith Babar\u2019s case set to be\nreviewed in the near future, and\nwith the recent backlash against\nthe \u2018anti-terror\u2019 legislation following the recent, and in my opinion\nlong-awaited, departure of David\nBlunkett, there is much to be done.\nIn addition to supporting the regular protests in London, as well as\nat the prison where Babar is being\nheld, action is being planned on\ncampus. A week of events, hosted\nby several of our clubs and socie-ties, and possibly a central Union\nevent, have been scheduled for\nFebruary. Prior to this, there will be\nan organising meeting for any individuals or society representatives\nwho want to take part in the cam-paign, to put their heads together\nand draw up a plan of action. The\nmeeting is likely to be held in the\nnear future, and anyone who wants\nto be kept informed about this, or to\nget involved in any other aspect of\nthe campaign, should email me at\ncs602@ic.ac.uk.\nCOLIN SMITH\nWELFARE CAMPAIGNS\nOFFICER\nTimes are a-changing\nThe new year has brought some\nchanges for the Imperial College\nUnion Advice Service.\nFirstly, the Advice Service has\nbeen re-located to the East Wing\nbasement of Beit Quad, which is\nnow the all-new Student Services\nCentre. We have moved to a new\noffice which is more appropriate for\nan advice service and should be\nmore comfortable for students to\nbe in.\nThe new year also brings with it a\nnew name: the Advice Service will\nnow be known as The Information\nand Advice Centre.

    "content": "As a treatment for depression, electroshock therapy has a bad image.\nBasil Safwat explains it may yet be the most effective treatment around\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 6 January 2005\n6\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAfter Prozac stopped work-ing, Anna tried everything to\ncure her suicidal depression.\nEleven types of antidepres-sants. Two courses of talk\ntherapy. \u2018Life enhancers\u2019\nsuch as frequent exercise and\na good diet.\nWhen the constant cycle of\nfailing antidepressants and\nineffective therapy became\ntoo much to bear, she had one\noption left to her. She was put\nunder general anesthetic at\nCharing Cross hospital and\ngiven a muscle relaxant. Two\nelectrodes were fixed to her\nhead, and a small electric\ncurrent was passed through\nher brain, inducing a massive grand mal seizure. She\nreturned the next week, and\nafter only three courses of\ntreatment, she emailed her\nsupport group to explain how\nshe felt:\n\u201cTruth is, I feel amazing.\nNot 100%, that would be too\nmuch, too soon, but I feel better than I\u2019ve felt in ages. definitely better than I\u2019ve felt in\na long long time. Yesterday,\nI was driving home from\nthe stables with my mum,\nand I found myself thinking\nthat \u2018if this change of mind\nis going to be permanent, I\nmay have to rethink my position on whether I want to be a\nparent\u2019. My position up until\nnow has been that I can\u2019t\nmake the commitment to try\nto stay alive, so I can\u2019t commit to being a parent. So this\nis quite a turnaround.\u201d\nThe treatment she underwent was electroconvulsive\ntherapy, or ECT. It is used\nby doctors to treat a variety\nof mental diseases, primarily\nsevere depression, and is\nwidely accepted as being an\neffective and safe treatment\nby the medical community.\nIndeed, for the short-term\ntreatment of depression, ECT\nhas been, in trials, observed\nto be more effective than\ndrug therapy. Despite these\nfindings, there are no waiting\nlists for ECT. A patient diagnosed with severe depression is unlikely to be offered\nECT until it is an absolute\nlast resort, after drugs have\nfailed and failed again. And\nthe numbers of patients prescribed ECT treatment is\ndropping.\nWhy should this be so? The\nproblem, like so much these\ndays, lies in marketing. The\npopular view of ECT is that\nof a barbaric treatment, with\nvague connotations of tor-ture, connotations not helped\nby media portrayals such as\nJack Nicholson\u2019s treatment in\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s\nNest, in which ECT leaves his\ncharacter as little more than\na vegetable, or Requiem For\nA Dream, where a character does not receive muscle\nrelaxants prior to treatment\nand experiences a set of spectacularly disturbing convul-sions.\nThese images of ECT may\nhave stemmed from its rather\nsinister history, which seems\nto have pervaded all subsequent consideration of the\ntreatment. Italian neuroscientist Ugo Cerletti first documented it in the 1930s, after\nobserving pigs being given\nelectric shocks before slaugh-ter; following the shocks, the\npigs would become manageable and quiet. He began\ntesting this finding on human\nsubjects, and discovered that\nthey were rendered calm in\nthe same way as the pigs.\nUnfortunately, he performed\nhis experiments without\nanesthetic or muscle relax-ants, causing violent, uncontrolled spasms, during which\npatients would often snap\nbones or break teeth. It\nbecame something to dread,\nand was sometimes used as a\nmethod of punishment in psychiatric wards for this reason.\nSome reports suggest that\nECT was even adopted by\nthe Nazis for human experi-ments.\nPig murder, broken bones,\nNazis; already a wonderful\nadvertisement for any treat-ment. The major obstacle to\nECT acceptance, however,\nturns out to be far simpler\nthan any of these reasons. It\nis a simple lack of knowledge\n\u2013 that is, no one knows how\nit works. Shock a depressed\nperson, and 60-80% of the\ntime, they will become hap-pier, instantaneously. Ask a\npsychiatrist why, and he may\nmention something about\nelectrical current stimulating the production of certain\nneurotransmitters; but in\ntruth this is mostly conjec-ture. If they could prove this\nlink then they could say that\nECT \u201cworks like Prozac\u201d and\nleap some of the hurdles to\nacceptance. Without this cer-tainty, however, the treatment\nretains a sense of mystery\nthat is unsettling for both\npatient and doctor.\nThis is not to say that\nthere are no documented\nside effects associated with\nECT. Early use of ECT saw\napplication of the electrodes\nacross the whole brain (\u2018bilaterally\u2019), which often seemed\nto result in some short-to-mid\nterm memory loss. For this\nreason, current ECT is usually performed unilaterally,\nwith the electrodes placed on\nthe right hemisphere of the\nhead. Studies show that there\nis no associated memory loss\nwith unilateral treatment.\nSuch scientific studies are\nrebutted by mental health\ncharities such as Mind who\nhave published surveys with\nvery different findings. In a\n2001 survey, they reported\nthat 40.5% of their respondents complained that they\nhad experienced \u2018permanent\nmemory loss as a result of\nECT\u2019. This illustrates the\nhuge differences between science\u2019s view and that of the\ngeneral public.\nWhile a scientist would\nprobably point out that people\ncannot remember what they\ncannot remember and so a\nsurvey is a largely redundant\nmethod of testing memory,\none could reply that if people\nperceive a treatment as having harmed them, then this is\nlittle different from it actually\nhaving harmed them. Despite\nthe efforts in this area, then,\nthe gap between scientists\nand the public is once again\nexposed. And as fewer people\nagree to ECT, fewer doctors\nare able to see its effects first-hand, and so fewer are likely\nto prescribe it.\nDespite all the controversy,\nhowever, the reply from those\npsychiatrists still advocating\nits use is as simple as it is\ntrue: ECT works faster than\ndrugs, has fewer side effects,\nand doesn\u2019t hurt. While they\nmay have little clue as to why\nit works, the brewing storm\nover anti-depressant side\neffects may force both doctors and patients to re-exam-ine their opinions on ECT and\nits effects.\nIt\u2019s a very odd feeling \u2013 like\nsomething is missing. then\nwhen I ask myself what\u2019s\nmissing, the only thing is\nthat dark and awful sense\nof helplessness and hopelessness which has become my\nconstant ally. Today I spent\na whole day where this feeling was remarkable by its\nabsence.\nFor some patients, like\nAnna, the effects can be life\naltering.\n\u201cFor the short term\ntreatment of depres-sion, ECT has been, in\ntrials, observed to be\nmore effective than\ndrug therapy\u201d\nWhen to resort to shock tactics\nDepression: electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has proven to be an effective treatment, but\nscientists still do not understand how it works\nNews\nin brief\nCalifornian\nbiotech firm sells\nfirst cloned kitten\nA California firm that earlier this year launched the\nworld\u2019s first cat cloning service has announced its first\nsale: a cloned male kitten\nnamed \u2018Little Nicky\u2019. Genetic\nSavings & Clone \u2013 based in\nSausalito, California, and\nfinanced by billionaire John\nSperling \u2013 announced that it\nhad sold the kitten to a Texas\nwoman for $50,000.\n\u2018Atom school\u2019 in\nfirst Israeli reactor\nvideo\nIsrael has released the first\nvideo footage of its Dimona\nnuclear plant in an apparent\nattempt to promote a positive\nimage of what experts believe\nto be an atomic bomb factory.\nChannel 10 television said\nits tape of the plant showed\ntechnicians in various non-military activities \u2013 mingling\non the lawn, inspecting lab\nequipment and lecturing at\nan \u2018atomic school\u2019 for disadvantaged youths.\nRussia to stop free\nspace trips for US\nastronauts\nRussia\u2019s cash-strapped space\nagency said it would stop\ngiving US astronauts free\nrides into orbit in the future.\nRussia has single-handedly\nserviced the International\nSpace Station, a $95 billion\norbiting laboratory, for almost\ntwo years since the United\nStates grounded its Shuttles\nafter the fatal Columbia\naccident.\nQuake may have\nmade the Earth\nwobble\nThe deadly Asian earthquake\nmay have permanently accelerated the Earth\u2019s rotation,\nshortening days by a fraction\nof a second.

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nThe names Pendragon, Pickle and\nThe Gathering might sound more\nlike characters from some role-play-ing card game you enjoy with your\nscience fiction buddies, but they are\nalso the names of three of London\u2019s\nbiggest rave promoters. With decades of collective experience, these\nthree hold psy-trance-oriented\nevents all over London and beyond.\nThey have a loyal set of fans who are\nalways up for a party, so what better\nplace could there be for a psy-guy\nlike myself to spend New Year\u2019s Eve\nthan around like-minded people, getting rocked and twisted by what I\nfind to be one of the most extreme\nforms of dance music?\nIn my years at Imperial I have\nalways found that clubbers, especially those with similar tastes to mine,\nare incredibly thin on the ground.\nSince my (only) stalwart club buddy\nhad flown east to sunnier climes, I\nwas forced to ship in reinforcements\nfrom my renowned and beautiful\nhome county of Essex. Actually, they\ninvited me out, but I\u2019m the one writing the review.\nSo off we trotted, up to the north\nside of town and Holloway Road,\nin search of The Rocket Complex.\nHaving gone the wrong way once,\nwe proceeded to walk right past the\nplace then around the block before\neventually arriving. Yes, it had been\na very long year. Luckily there was\nno queue at all. The door staff were\nfriendly (even if the bouncer searching me did insist on announcing everything he could feel in my pockets)\nand entrance was no hassle.\nThe Rocket Complex is a students\u2019\nunion building located on London\nMetropolitan University\u2019s north\ncampus. The place consists of several downstairs bars, but for nights like\nthis they also hire out the upstairs, a\nsports hall. Add drapes, some disco\nlights, two high-powered lasers and\nvast stacks of speakers putting out\nabout the same level of sound as a\nsmall jet engine, and you have all\nthe ingredients for a great night out.\nExcept, that is, for the most important ingredient \u2013 the people.\nWe arrived just after 10pm, so\nadmittedly the place had only been\nopen for an hour, but even so it did\nseem to be particularly empty. First\nwe explored the downstairs areas,\ncoming first to the main downstairs\nbar. Looking around the place it\nreally could have been any union,\nsave for the extra decorations and\nthe day-glo cyber kids wandering\naround. In this room we found what\nwe\u2019d been waiting for \u2013 pulsating,\npsychedelic sounds.\nPsychedelic trance is really quite\ncrazy music. Originating in Goa,\nIndia in the late eighties and early\nnineties, this kind of music was first\nproduced by the people who stayed in\nGoa after most of the hippies had left,\nto mess around with music, practise\nyoga and probably take lots of drugs.\nThe resulting style of music, known\nas Goa trance, and more recently as\nthe sound has spread, psy-trance, is\none of my favourite styles of dance.\nIt\u2019s generally a bit faster than other\nstyles, and usually includes an\narpegiatted chugging bassline, as\nwell as as much aural envelopment\nas possible \u2013 squelchy sounds, distorted acid-tinged riffs and random\nvocal samples. The resulting wall of\nsound is a relentless attack on the\nears and feet. In clubs with speakers at opposites sides of vast rooms,\nall the sqeaks and beeps sound like\nthey\u2019re flying round your head, at\nyour head, in your head, whilst the\nbeats and bass leave you only one\noption \u2013 dance like a mentalist!\nThis was exactly what they were\nplaying downstairs, and it sounded\ngreat. Unrelenting, with few break-downs, with extra sounds from a\nkeyboard, it had the few people that\nwere dancing early on going wild.\nCrazy round-your-head sounds an\npressing beats mean crazy dance\nmoves. People who like psy trance\nare way past the attitude, front, and\n\u2018cool\u2019 you find in more mainstream\nclubs with more mainstream music.\nThey dance exactly as you should\n\u2013 like no-one\u2019s watching! Close your\neyes,letyourselfgetlostinthemusic,\nand your body will follow. Limbs go\nanywhere and everywhere, people\nspin around and jump and bounce\n(facilitated by the relative emptiness\nof the place at this point). It\u2019s a sight\nto behold.\nExploring further, we found a particularly quiet chill-out area and\nsnack bar, and a second room of\nmusic, this time much more sensible and a fair bit slower than before.\nFunky house is the best way to\ndescribe it \u2013 mostly vocal led, poppy\nsounding tunes. It\u2019s all good stuff,\nbut tonight the psy was the apple of\nmy eye. Or, ear.\nOur next mission was finding the\nthird room. After a few laps of down-stairs, and investigation of a few\ncorridors that turned out to be the\nladies\u2019, we eventually asked someone who pointed us to the upstairs,\nwhere the main room had been set\nup in the aforementioned sports\nhall. Since it was still early, this vast\narena seemed incredibly bare, but\nthe scene was set and 2005 was\nonly hours away. The gigantic PA\nwas booming, the lasers scanned\nthe air, and gradually we were drawn\nonto the dancefloor. The music here\nwas more of the psy, though subtlely\ndifferent. There were more break-downs, more opportunities for laser-reaching, as the sound went up and\ndown into and out of big, euphoric\nbreakdowns. The beats were more\nvaried too, with the odd break here\nand there. As we danced around,\nenjoying the freedom of movement\nyou get when you\u2019re not jammed in\nlike sardines, the place was filling\nup. Clearly the hardcore ravers were\nonly just starting to arrive.\nBy 12 o\u2019clock, the room was pretty\nfull. Still nowhere near capacity, but\nenough people to carry the atmosphere whilst leaving plenty of room\nfor flailing body parts. At the stroke\nof midnight, a large net of balloons\nwas released over the crowd. To\ngive you an idea of just how bloody\nloud it was, whilst standing bang in\nthe middle of the floor, the balloon I\nwas holding was vibrating so much\na could use it to tap people on the\nhead. The mood was great and the\nparty was ready to kick off and keep\nkicking for the next six hours. And\nkick off it did.\nI have to confess that much of\nwhat came next is a bit of a blur to\nme, since I was indulging myself\nin the age-old tradition of spending\nNew Year\u2019s Eve getting off my face. I\ndo know it was a great night though,\nand my friends and I stomped all\nthrough the night.

    "content": "4\nFelix\nThursday 6 January 2005\nNEWS felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nThe mechanical engineering department\u2019s library and\nreading room may close in the\nnear future, in order to create\nspace for other departments\nor administrative staff.\nThe library holds books,\nprojects, exam papers and\nsolutions in a convenient loca-tion, and the adjacent reading room is a large open-plan\nspace with natural light. Both\nare popular with students and\nare usually full to capacity\nduring exam periods. Felix\nunderstands that high-level\ndiscussions on the matter\nbegan last term and are set\nto continue over the coming\nweeks.\nA petition against the clo-sure, signed by over 400\nmechanical engineering\nstudents, has been given\nto the head of department,\nProfessor Roderick Smith.\nWhen asked whether or not\nthe library and reading room\nwould close, Prof Smith told\nFelix: \u201cI don\u2019t know... we are\nat a very early stage of discussion\u201d.\nHe continued: \u201cIt may be\nmoved, because other people\nwant to use the space. There\nis a huge shortage of space on\ncampus\u201d.\nOne option is to move the\ncollections to the central\nlibrary, but this is almost\nguaranteed to be unpopular\nwith students.\nIn a letter accompanying\nthe petition, Helen Dawson,\nthe mechanical engineering\ndepartment representative,\noutlined the reasons why the\nlibrary and reading room are\nso valuable to students. The\nletter claims that it is particularly important to have\nall projects, exam papers and\nsolutions available, and that\nthis access would be lost in\nthe central library as staff\nwould not be able to give specific advice. Also, students\nare able to borrow journals\nfrom the department library,\nbut this is not permitted in\nthe central library.\nMiss Dawson told Felix:\n\u201cThe library is an invaluable source to students at\nall stages of their education\nat Imperial. Undergraduate\nand PhD students alike rely\non the personal service from\nNasim Jensen, which will be\nlost if everything is moved to\nthe central library.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only mechanical\nengineering students who use\nthe library and the reading\nroom \u2013 bioengineering and\nearth science engineering\nstudents are regular users of\nthe space.\u201d\nProf Smith said that students had been \u201cpremature\u201d in their response and\nhad acted only on the basis\nof rumours. However, he\nemphasised that their views\nwould be \u201cnoted and taken\ninto account\u201d.\nIn an email to Felix,\nRichard Martin, the Faculty\nof Engineering\u2019s Deputy\nOperating Officer, said of\nthe reading room: \u201cIt is one\narea, among many across the\nSouth Kensington campus,\nthat is being looked at as a\npotential solution to a series\nof conflicting demands for\nspace.\u201d\nMr Martin confirmed that\nno decision had yet been\ntaken, and that if the area\nwas converted for a different use, alternative working\nspace would be provided.\nMechanical Engineering library and\nreading room may close\nBy Beccy Knights\nEntrepreneurs Challenge\nManager\nThe Ideas Challenge prize\ngiving event took place at the\nend of last term.

He\nwas rearrested in August this\nyear on allegations of involvement in acts of terrorism and\nis currently awaiting extradition to the United States. His\ncase is due to be reviewed in\nthe near future.\nMr Ahmad\u2019s supporters\nbelieve that he was abused\nby police while in custody, his\nhuman rights may be under\nthreat if he is extradited, and\nhe should be given a fair trial\nin the UK.\nAt a Union Council meeting\nat the end of last term, when\nthe decision was made, Colin\nSmith, the Union\u2019s Welfare\nCampaigns Officer and one of\nthe motion\u2019s many seconders,\nwas ejected after shouting\nobscenities when it appeared\nthat the proposal supporting\nMr Ahmad was about to fall.\nIn a moment of high drama,\nMr Smith called the Council\n\u201ca f***ing disgrace\u201d and\nwas asked to leave by Danny\nSharpe, chair of the meeting.\nMr Smith initially refused to\nleave the room, and at one\nstage a total of eight College\nsecurity officers were present\nas various people attempted\nto defuse the situation.\nThemeetingwasadjourned,\nMr Smith finally left, and\nthe Council then voted on a\nproposal to not consider the\nBabar Ahmad paper due to its\n\u201cinherently political nature\u201d.\nJohn Collins, President of\nthe City and Guilds College\nUnion, said: \u201cMy members\nsay that the Union should not\ntake a political stance.\u201d\nSimon Rawson, Chair of\nthe Arts and Entertainments\nBoard, added: \u201cI don\u2019t disagree with this policy, but I feel\ndeeply uncomfortable about\nthe Union politicising itself in\nthis way.\u201d\nMr Smith, before his depar-ture, had referred to the large\nnumber of people attending\nthe meeting in support of\nMr Ahmad: \u201cBy the strength\nof feeling in this room, we\nowe it to everyone who has\nturned up here to vote on this\nmotion\u201d.\nEventually, the motion\nwas considered and passed,\nthough most Council members abstained from voting,\nprobably due to a reluctance\nto engage in a campaign they\nviewed as political and not\ndirectly affecting current\nImperial College students.\nThe paper\u2019s supporters,\nhowever, argued that the\nUnion\u2019s backing was necessary and appropriate because\nMr Ahmad had studied and\nworked at Imperial, and\nbecause any current student\ncould potentially suffer similar problems in the future.\nMr Smith later called the\ndecision to campaign for Mr\nAhmad\u2019s release \u201ca victory\nfor democracy\u201d.\nThe Union also resolved\nto \u201censure that any form of\ndiscrimination experienced\nby Imperial College students,\nboth on and off campus, is\ndealt with thoroughly\u201d, \u201cto\ncampaign for a full investigation into the alleged assault\non Babar [Ahmad] by the\npolice officers who arrested\nhim\u201d, \u201cto campaign for his\nhuman rights to be respected\nin court proceedings\u201d and for\nMr Ahmad to be given a fair\ntrial in the UK.\nSeveral Union clubs and\nsocieties have already begun\nto campaign on Mr Ahmad\u2019s\nbehalf, and a week of events\nhas been scheduled for\nFebruary.\n\u25cf Editorial, page 9\n\u25cf Colin Smith, page 9\n\u25cf Letters to the Editor,\npage 10\nUnion will campaign to free former\nstudent imprisoned under terror laws\nClockwise from top left: Kareem Osman makes his case for why Imperial College Union should campaign to free former\nstudent Babar Ahmad; the Council considers the proposal; security guards surround Colin Smith (third from left) after\nhe is asked to leave the meeting; some of Mr Ahmad\u2019s many supporters gather to discuss the issue\nThe year of physics\nCelebrating science in 2005,\npage 7\nBabar Ahmad in custody\nThe IC Devils\n\n"

They are often the\nbest, and Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series\nOf Unfortunate Events is no excep-tion.\nOne of Lemony Snicket\u2019s famous\nbooks has come to life thanks to\nJude Law. He plays the author him-self, reading the story in the most\nmystical voice, providing all the\nenchantment and magic the film\nneeds. The film occasionally cuts\nout to Lemony Snicket\u2019s shadow as\nhe tells the terrible tales.\nSnicket sets the scene with: \u201cThis\nis not a happy film. If you wish to\nwatch a film about a happy little elf\nthen you still have time to leave the\ncinema.\u201d I was excited \u2013 this wasn\u2019t\ngoing to be the usual type of movie.\nThe Baudelaire children are\nexceptional. Violet Baudelaire\n(Emily Browning) is an inventor.\nKlaus Baudelaire (Liam Allen)\nreads books, millions of books, and\nremembers the contents of every\nsingle one. Sunny Baudelaire, the\nyoungest of the three, likes to bite\nthings.\nThe children are now the\nBaudelaire orphans, after a mysterious fire killing their parents, meaning that Violet will inherit a huge\nfortune on her eighteenth birthday.\nThe orphans are sent to their uncle,\nCount Olaf (Jim Carrey), who is only\nafter them for their huge inheritance and will do anything to get it. It\nis up to the children to stop him.\nThe director, Brad Siberling, made\nan excellent adaptation of the book,\nproducing a film with magnificent\nscenes and an otherworldly feel.\nEach setting is beautifully twisted\nfrom one of the pages of the book.\nEach scene is full of fantasy and\nimagination. All the characters are\ncast perfectly.\nAnother example of the great\nadaptation from book to film is that\nin the books baby Sunny\u2019s quarks\nand ga-gas are given as translations,\nbut in the films they are subtitled\nand provide many laughs. This was\nthe first time I had ever laughed at a\ntoddler in a film for their humorous\nlines, even though the youngster in\nLook Who\u2019s Talking did come very\nclose.\nThis brings me on to Jim Carrey.\nHe overshadows everyone else in\nthe film, yet again stealing all the\nbest lines and every good scene. It\nwould not have been the same film\nwithout him \u2013 no one else was up\nto the standard to play the intense,\noverpowering Count Olaf, who is\nbrought to life in a powerful and passionate way.\nViolet and Klaus portray the children in the most mature way, really\nsuiting the parts they are playing.\nJust like all good fantasy films, there\nare quirky and unusual characters\neverywhere that will keep you enter-tained. Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly)\nand Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep)\nare two such characters.\nThis is not your traditional kids\u2019\nstory \u2013 everything is not always\nhappy and rosy in Lemony Snicket\u2019s\nA Series Of Unfortunate Events, as\nthe title tells you.\nThere are a lot of unfinished end-ings, which can leave you slightly\nagitated. However, this is a family\nfilm that will introduce a lot of people to the books. A good fantasy film\nfor all. Melissa Parkinson\nLemony Snicket\u2019s A Series\nOf Unfortunate Events\nDirector: Brad Silberling\nStarring: Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep,\nJude Law, Emily Browning, Liam\nAiken\nLength: 104 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHHHH\nJim Carrey (centre) as Count Olaf in Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\u201cEach scene is full\nof fantasy and\nimagination\u201d\nMore flying ninja warriors\nZhang\u2019s new release is breathtakingly beautiful but has its flaws\nZhang Yimou\u2019s House of Flying\nDaggers takes place during the\ndecline of the Tang Dynasty in 859AD\nand follows captains Leo (Andy Lau)\nand Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) on their\nmission to bring down one of the\nmost prolific rebel groups in China,\nthe House of Flying Daggers, who,\nlike Robin Hood, steal from the rich\nto give to the poor.\nJin and Mei (Ziyi Zhang), a\nwoman from the House of Flying\nDaggers, disguise themselves in\norder to seduce each other in mutually opposed attempts at infiltration,\nentrapment and ambush. Both plans\nwork, but Jin and Mei also fall in love\nwith each other, which screws everything up. We never find out what\nthe political outcome is; the movie\nconcentrates on the complications\nbetween Jin and Mei, as well as\nMei\u2019s other love interest Leo, also a\ndouble agent.\nMany movies have combined a love\nstory with martial arts action, but\nthe love story has to be compelling\nto work well, and this one doesn\u2019t\nreally take off until the movie is\nalmost over. Even with all the grav-ity-defying leaps and the characters\u2019 superhuman abilities, the most\nunbelievable element in Zhang\u2019s film\nis the love story. In spite of that, it\u2019s\nstill a movie worth seeing.\nThe movie places a lot of emphasis\non style and it is certainly gorgeous,\nespecially Mei\u2019s dance at the begin-ning. Other highlights are the Echo\nGame, in which Mei stands within\na circle of upright drums which she\nhas to strike with the exceptionally\nlong sleeves of her robe in the same\norder as they\u2019re struck by pebbles. I\nknow it doesn\u2019t sound like much, but\ntrust me, it\u2019s the film\u2019s most memorable moment.\nThis is only Zhang\u2019s second wuxia\nfilm. Once again, he uses a minimal\ncast of characters, but those that\nfound Hero\u2019s narrative somewhat\nconfusing will appreciate his more\nlinear approach to storytelling.\nZhang has proven that he is a master at turning celluloid into canvas.\nCoupled with sparse dialogue and\nstraightforward narratives, his films\nare comprised of frame after frame of\nbreathtaking beauty. Unfortunately,\nhe succeeds in neglecting a crucial\npoint of character development, one\nthat cannot be compensated for by\nfast-paced fight scenes or gorgeous\nswirling snow.\nThe most notable missing element\nfrom the crew of Hero is cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who\nbrought so much to the look and\nfeel of Hero. Without him, the action\nscenes are filmed with far less style\nand flair, and the colour palette\nseems more muted, sticking to the\nearthier greens, yellows and browns\nfound in nature. There are plenty\nof action set-pieces involving flying\nninja warriors and, of course, some\nserious dagger-tossing, but the focus\non Jin and Mei makes it feel quite\ndrawn out.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, House is a\ngorgeous film, almost as striking as\nHero. Avoid getting too distracted\ntrying to keep track of the characters\u2019 changing agendas, and enjoy\nthe production design, costumes\nand landscapes. All are sublime.\nThe fights are amazing ballets,\nbut what was breathtaking in The\nMatrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden\nDragon is getting old. If your heroes\ncan literally do anything, it tends to\nsuck the tension out of their confron-tations. It also leads to unintentional\nlaughs, as in the bizarre case of\na character that won\u2019t stay dead,\nwhich in my opinion really ruined\nthe film by turning it into a comedy.\nHow many death scenes is one person allowed, anyway?\nIt\u2019s an impressive undertaking, to\ncombine music and dance, sumptuous visual design and violent action\n\u2013 reason enough to see it on the big\nscreen, as it just won\u2019t be the same\non your television \u2013 but the material\nis kitsch.\nOn its own, House is a marvellous and beautiful film, but following on the heels of Hero and even\nCrouching Tiger, something is lost.\nInstead of being another truly great\nfilm from Zhang, it\u2019s simply a very\ngood one. Haj Alttahir\nHouse Of Flying Daggers\nDirector: Zhang Yimou\nStarring: Zhang Ziyi, Takeshi\nKaneshiro, Andy Lau\nLength: 119 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHI\n\u201cThere are plenty of action set-pieces involving flying ninja warriors...\u201d\n\u201cA marvellous and\nbeautiful film...\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 6 January 2005 3\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nWith an overwhelming major-ity, Imperial College Union\nCouncil has passed a paper\naiming to improve accountability of Union officers and\ncommunication throughout\nthe Union as a whole.\nThePresident,MustafaArif,\nreceived particular criticism\nin the paper, and must now\nreveal \u201chis exact timesheet\nand whereabouts... and the\npurpose of those activities for\nthe benefit of the Union\u201d from\n1 September to the present.\nHe has also been mandated\nto apologise to the Council\nfor irregularities surrounding\nrecent elections.\nThe paper raises several serious concerns about\nthe way in which Imperial\nCollege Union has been run\nso far this year, highlighting\nthe following issues: the disappearance of the constitution from the internet; bad\nmanagement at elections; an\nunder-represented Executive\nCommittee; alleged inappropriate involvement of permanent staff members in Union\nactivity; a less accountable\nstyle of taking minutes leading directly to a less account-abledecision-makingprocess;\nand unauthorised increases\nin staff costs.\nThe paper argues that \u201cthe\nPresident appears to be in a\nposition... where he cannot\nfulfil his duties effectively\u201d\nand that recent management\nrestructuring \u201cgoes explicitly contrary to the spirit of\ndemocracy in the Union\u201d.\nIt goes on to make the con-troversialclaimthattheUnion\nis in breach of the Education\nAct 1994, with reference to its\nfinancial situation.\nOne key issue raised\nby the paper was the\n\u2018Redevelopment Masterplan\nof the Beit Quadrangle\u2019. A\ndraft document, prepared\nby Imperial College Estates\nin November, says that the\nUnion has already agreed\nto make various large-scale\nchanges to the Quadrangle\nbefore receiving any responses from its recent Strategic\nReview questionnaire.\nThe document states: \u201cThe\nStudent Union wish to incorporate into the redevelopment an enhanced catering\nand dining facility on the first\nfloor\u201d, move the offices to\nthe third floor, create a \u201cnonalcoholic drink area\u201d, build a\n\u201clocal authority type council\nroom\u201d on the third floor in\nplace of one of the snooker\nrooms, and \u201cstrip out the\nexisting gym\u201d.\nMr Arif insisted that the\ndocument was \u201conly a draft,\nasking Estates to come up\nwith some proposals, so that\nafter the Strategic Review we\ncan choose an architect and\nmove forward\u201d. He stressed\nthat the document was merely a \u201cstarting point for discussion\u201d, no decisions had been\nmade, and no money had\nbeen paid to any architects.\nDan Lehmann, a member of the Union\u2019s Services\nCommittee, said: \u201cMost people believe the Masterplan\nand the Strategic Review have\nalready been written\u201d, implying that senior Union officers\nand staff had already made\ntheir own decisions about the\nfuture of the Quadrangle, and\nthat students\u2019 views would\nnot be taken into account.\nSameena Misbahuddin, the\nDeputy President (Finance\nand Services) and chair of the\nStrategic Review Advisory\nGroup, told Felix: \u201cWe\nwouldn\u2019t have spent all our\ntime and effort talking to stu-dents, putting up posters and\nwriting articles if the Review\nhad already been written. I\nwant the students to get what\nthey want. When the actual\nMasterplan is drawn up, it\nwill not be the same as the\ndocument from Estates.\u201d\nIn a separate motion,\nthe Council subsequently\nresolved that the gym would\n\u201cremain in its present location and not be converted for\nany other use unless specifically authorised by Council\u201d\nand that \u201cthe snooker room\nshould not be converted into\na Council chamber\u201d.\nThe President is now mandated to \u201cexplain how a document outlining the desired\nplans for the Union building\ndated November was passed\nto three architectural firms,\nwhilst the consultation period\namongst students did not end\nuntil December\u201d.\nHe must also \u201cupdate\nCouncil on the progress made\nwith regards to finding the\nestimated \u00a337,000 shortfall on\nthe management restructuring process\u201d.\nThe Council Chair, Danny\nSharpe, was mandated to\n\u201censure a reliable up-to-date\ncopy of the Constitution\u201d is\nposted on the Union website\n\u201cwithin one week of passing\nthis motion\u201d. He must also\n\u201cre-open the investigation\ninto the financial irregulari-ties... and ascertain whether\nthere is a case to answer that\nthe President may have acted\nirresponsibly to the point of\ngross misconduct\u201d.\nFinally, an amendment\nwas made forcing the minutes from the high-level\nManagement and Planning\nGroup to be made public.\nTom Tibbits, who proposed the paper, told Felix:\n\u201cThe main thing I wanted to\nachieve was that the accountability of the Union is restored\nto where it should have been.\nThe students will now be\nconsulted about the future of\ntheir Union.\n\u201cI was absolutely gutted\nabout the lack of transparency that the Union has\nachieved so far this year. I\u2019ve\ngot to say that Mustafa Arif in\nparticular has been grossly\nnegligent in his capacity as\nPresident to represent the\nstudents and not himself.\u201d\nResponding to the sweeping\ncondemnation of his actions,\nMr Arif said: \u201cI accept we\ncould have handled this a lot\nbetter... [but] I did not lie to\nanyone in any aspect.\n\u201cI can understand why\npeople think that the Union\nis suffering from a lack of\naccountability and democra-cy, but that view is misguided.\nThe Union suffers from over-governance, and... sometimes\nyou need to realise that democratic processes can actually hold up democracy.\n\u201cI look forward to the\nopportunity to put together a\nresponse and to disprove the\nallegations of impropriety in\nthe paper.\u201d\n\u25cf State of the Union,\npage 8\nPresident attacked over accountability\nas \u2018Beit Masterplan\u2019 is discovered\nMustafa Arif (centre), President of Imperial College Union, gives an initial response to allegations of impropriety\nAccording to a draft document dated November,\nImperial College Union wishes to:\n\u25cf Build new offices on the third floor\n\u25cf Create a local authority-type council room\non the third floor in place of one of the snooker\nrooms\n\u25cf Strip out the existing gym\n\u25cf Change Da Vinci\u2019s into a non-alcoholic drinks\narea, a \u201cStarbucks type caf\u00e9\u201d\n\u25cf Incorporate into the redevelopment an enhanced catering and dining facility on the first\nfloor\nThe Union\u2019s Strategic Review process, in which\nstudents were consulted on these issues via a\nquestionnaire, did not finish until December \u2013 long\nafter the draft document was produced\n\u201cThe draft document is merely a starting point for\ndiscussion. Nothing has been decided yet\u201d\n\u2013 Mustafa Arif, Union President\n\u201cMost people believe the Masterplan and the\nStrategic Review have already been written\u201d\n\u2013 Dan Lehmann\n\u2018REDEVELOPMENT MASTERPLAN OF THE BEIT QUADRANGLE\u2019\nBy Dave Edwards\nA hotel in Kensington could\nprovide the solution to\nImperial College students\u2019\naccommodation problems,\noffering beds from just \u00a35 per\nnight.\nThe hotel, in Lexham\nGardens, was founded by\nStelios, the serial entrepreneur and owner of easyJet,\neasyCar and other related\ncompanies. It will be known\nas an easyHotel, providing\nno-frills, low-cost accommo-dation. Customers can book\nrooms on a website with a\ncredit card, on a \u2018book early,\npay less\u2019 basis. Prices will rise\nin periods of high demand.\nWith Imperial students\u2019\nhall fees and rent costs ever-increasing, the development\nof the hotel has raised the\npossibility that students could\nbook rooms for months at a\ntime. They would be able to\nstay in hotel accommodation\nand, potentially, save large\namounts of money.\nHall fees currently range\nfrom \u00a354 to \u00a3127 per person\nper week (approximately),\nand renting in the private\nsector can cost a student well\nover \u00a3100 per week. Compare\nthis with \u00a35 per night, and\ntherefore \u00a335 per week, during the cheapest periods at\nthe easyHotel, and you can\nsee the attraction.\nSam Rorke, Imperial\nCollege Union\u2019s Deputy\nPresident (Education and\nWelfare) told Felix: \u201cI\u2019d like\nto see what\u2019s on offer for \u00a35\na day.\u201d Comparing the cost\nof staying at the easyHotel\nto that of living in a hall of\nresidence, Mr Rorke added:\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to living in\nhalls than just a bed. There\u2019s\na community, there\u2019s security,\nand there are social activities.\u201d\nA spokesman for easyGroup\nsaid: \u201cYou will be interested\nto hear that even without\nadvertising or marketing, the\npower of the brand is resulting in reservation requests\narriving regularly.\u201d\nThe hotel in Kensington\nis due to open in the sum-mer, with around 30 rooms.\nIn due course, the company expects to expand\neasyHotel into more cities,\ncountries and continents.\nNew Kensington hotel to offer accommodation from just \u00a335 per week\nCan Imperial students save\non accommodation costs by\nbooking rooms at the new\neasyHotel?\n\u201cI accept we\ncould have\nhandled this a\nlot better...\u201d\nMUSTAFA ARIF\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 6 January 2005\n8\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nSix months to go...\nHappy new year! I don\u2019t have any\nparticular message this week, so I\u2019ll\nrun through my top ten priorities\n(as they came out of my head) for\nmy remaining six months in office\n(and this term in particular).\nPostgraduates\nThe Union lacks a properly grounded postgraduate representation\nstructure. To some extent, the\nPostgraduate Society provides a\nsocial forum but the Union really\nneeds to establish a Postgraduate\nAssociation akin to the Faculty\nUnions. I hope to have this in place\nbefore I leave.\nQAA Institutional Audit\nThank you so much for participating in the Union\u2019s online student\nsurvey last term. We achieved a\ngood response. This will be the single most important opportunity to\nimprove the student experience at\nImperial for the next five years (see\nSam\u2019s update below).\nStrategic Review and Union\nplan\nSameena has written an update\n(below) on the Strategic Review\nprocess. It\u2019s now really important\nthat we use all the information\ngained to agree and develop a business for the Union for the next\nCollege planning cycle.\nCasual payroll\nSeveral hundred students work on\na casual basis in various College\ndepartments (catering, confer-ences, ICT, etc) as well as at the\nUnion. They used to be paid weekly,\nhowever last term they were moved\non to a monthly pay system. Along\nwith implementation problems, this\nhas caused significant hardship\nfor many of the most financially-pressed students at the College. I\nhope to have this resolved within\na month.\nUnion governance\nThere are various parts of the\nUnion\u2019s governance that are \u2018broken\u2019. Lack of support of postgraduates is one area. The structure of\nthe Life Sciences Faculty Union is\nanother. However the biggest problem is that the Union is over-gov-erned. There are too many rules\nthat are never enforced (and impossible to do), especially for clubs\nand societies, and too many layers\nof decision-making that hinder, not\nhelp, the democratic process.\nAsian tsunami\nInevitably there will be many\nstudents who have been affected,\nand many more who will want to\nhelp in some way. The RAG Chair\nhas written a piece (see page 2)\non some of the fundraising activities that are going on around the\nUnion. I expect much more to\nhappen over the coming weeks \u2013\nespecially when we start getting\nconfirmed information on how\nmany Imperial students have been\ndirectly affected.\nBeit Masterplan\nContrary to what some Council\nmembers thought, there is no\n\u2018Masterplan\u2019 (yet) and students\nwere always going to be consulted.\nThat will now happen, as per the\noriginal timetable (ie after the strategic plan is finalised) and will be an\nexciting opportunity to look at how\nwe can make best use of the Union\nbuilding in Beit Quad.\nSouthside\nThe College needs help from students (who are registered voters in Westminster) to write in to\nWestminster Council in support of\nthe College\u2019s planning application\nto demolish Southside and build\nnew halls of residence. There is\na serious chance that the Council\nmay block the application to keep\nlocal residents happy. Expect an\nemail from me this week...\nRees Commission \u2013 Top-up\nfees in Wales\nThe Union will be sending a submission to the Rees Commission which\nis looking at the possible implementation of top-up fees in Wales. This\nimpacts Imperial students because\nthe situation in England will be\nreviewed in 2009. If, by that time,\nthe Welsh Assembly Government\nhas developed a successful alternative funding model then that could\nwell be replicated here.\nBabar Ahmad\nUnion Council passed a motion\nrequiring the Union to campaign for\nthe release of Babar Ahmad. I hope\nwe can use this opportunity to look\nat some broader issues affecting\nImperial students that I have hinted\nat in previous columns.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nThe joy of... quality assurance\nQuality assurance is one of those\npieces of jargon that seems to crop\nup more and more these days.\nIf you\u2019ve ever worked in indus-try, you are almost certain to have\nheard it used, but you may not necessarily see the point of it. Quality\nassurance (QA) is a programme\nfor the systematic monitoring and\nevaluation of a service to ensure\nthat standards of quality are being\nmet.\nBut why am I boring you with\nthis? Well, Imperial College takes it\nseriously and goes to great lengths\nto ensure student involvement in\nits QA process. That amounts to me\nspending a considerable amount of\nmy working day fulfilling a quality\nassurance role.\nOne example of this is the representation network that I co-ordi-nate. Year reps speak to their class,\nascertain any problems that students are having with a particular\ncourse, lecturer or facility, and have\na quiet word in the ear of the course\ndirector. If the problem cannot be\nsolved there and then, it may be\nnecessary to involve the departmental rep, and possibly raise\nthe issue in a forum such as the\nstaff-student committee. If the\nproblem is of a general nature, possibly affecting students in other\ndepartments, it may be brought to\nmy attention either at a meeting,\nor by email. I spend much of my\ntime sitting on College-level committees whose whole purpose is\nquality assurance, and I give this\nfeedback to those who can implement change.\nAnother example of quality\nassurance is the Student On-Line\nEvaluation (SOLE), which the\nCollege conducts every term to\nmonitor student satisfaction with\nundergraduate courses and lec-turers. Thanks to the 50% of you\nwho took the time to complete this\nvaluable exercise. Your department\nor your representatives should let\nyou know the results of the survey\nshortly. If they don\u2019t, chase them up,\nbecause it\u2019s important!\nQuality assurance is particularly\npertinent at the moment, because\nthe College is undergoing an\ninstitutional audit by the Quality\nAssurance Agency (QAA), an independent body set up to safeguard\nthe public interest in sound academic standards. This is done by\ncarrying out reviews of standards\nand quality in higher education\ninstitutions.\nIn order to gain student input into\nthe process, the QAA has asked the\nUnion to submit a \u201cstudent written\nstatement\u201d, representative of the\nviews of the student body, concerning their educational experience.\nThis has been compiled, based on\nthe responses to the recent ques-tionnaire, and students\u2019 opinions\ngleaned from focus groups, in addition to concerns fed through by the\nrepresentative system. A draft has\nbeen written, and is available at\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/qaa. This is not\nthe finished article, as it will still\ngo through the relevant commit-tees, on which your representatives\nsit, and eventually to the Union\nCouncil. However, if you are keen\nto comment on the document,\nor on any other matter, please\nget in touch with me directly at\ndpew@ic.ac.uk.\nUNCLE SAM\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nRemember that online survey?\nWell thank you to all those who\ntook part. It was the first time we\nhad done such a project on such a\nscale, and we had a great response\n\u2013 around 3,500 students taking part.\nWe also had a good response to the\nquestionnaire completed by clubs\nand society officers. Your responses\nwill be central to the way the Union\ndevelops over the next few years.\nThe winners of the Playstation\nand other prizes have not been\ndrawn yet, but this will happen in\nthe coming week and the results will\nbe published.\nAfter the online surveys were\nclosed, the process of analysing the\ndata and preparing the statistics\nbegan, as did the focus groups, which\nwere the second stage of information gathering \u2013 small groups of different cross sections of the student\nbody. These were brainstorming and\ndiscussion sessions (on the issues\ncovered in the survey), a method\noften used in industry. Thank you to\nthose who took part, especially so\nclose to the end of term!\nUsing the information from the\nsurvey and focus groups, a strategic plan for the Union will be submitted to the College\u2019s planning\nround, where we will bid for greater\ninvestment in the Union building\nand activities. The strategic plan\nwill also be the starting point for\nthe Union\u2019s budget and plans for the\nnext few years.\nIn addition, the information will\nbe used to form the brief given to\narchitects for a design for the Union\nbuilding. Next week, a decision as to\nwhich of three competing architects\nwill be used is being made by the\nUnion executive committee, based\non the firms\u2019 ability to design appropriately for a students\u2019 union of our\nnature.\nFrom the surveys we will also be\nlooking at the feedback we have\ngot and what ideas were put for-ward. We will use this information\nto improve areas of the Union that\nwere reviewed. We will be looking\nthrough all the results of the survey\nand comments that were made, and\nwe will use these to improve the\nUnion to better serve you. With so\nmany participants, we have a lot of\nvaluable information from students,\nwhich we want to use to improve\nthe Union.\nInformation about the Strategic\nReview can be found at www.union.\nic.ac.uk/strategicreview.\nSAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(FINANCE & SERVICES)\n\n"

    "content": "By Darius Nikbin\nScience Editor\nMistaken philosophers who\ncry \u201cAll is well\u201d,\nApproach, look upon these\nfrightful ruins,\nA hundred thousand wretches swallowed by the earth,\nBleeding, torn, with hearts\nstill beating,\nBuried beneath their roofs,\nIn racking torment end their\nstricken lives...\nIn 1755, an earthquake struck\nLisbon, causing the deaths of\nover 100,000 people. The city\ncentre was ripped apart by\ngiant fissures and an enormous tsunami devastated the\nharbour. In the ensuing days,\nreligious priests roamed\nthe streets hanging people,\naccusing them of heresy and\nblaming them for the earth-quake. At the same time, the\nMarquis decided to commission a scientific study of the\ndisaster. This decision lead\nto the birth of the science\nof seismology, as well as a\ngiant leap forward for the\nEuropean enlightenment\nperiod, as writers like Voltaire\ndemanded a more humanist\nresponse to the tragedy.\nHistory repeats itself, but\nhumans never learn. This\ntime,theearthquakeoccurred\nin south-east Asia. Scientists\nknew it was going to happen\nand that when it did, it would\nbe devastating. According\nto scientist Brian Atwater\nof the US Geological Survey,\n\u201cSumatra has an ample history of earthquakes... everyone knew that Sumatra was a\nloaded gun.\u201d But nobody took\ntheir advice on board until it\nwas too late.\nApart from being one of\nthe most densely populated regions of the world,\nthe afflicted areas were also\namongst the most religious.\nWithout doubt, the disaster\nwill have shaken the foundations of their faith. Since religion cannot begin to explain\nwhy or how over 140,000 innocent lives were lost, people\nwill inevitably, as they did\nin Lisbon over two hundred\nyears ago, demand a more\nsatisfactory explanation and\nscientific measures to prevent losses from such disasters in the future.\nThe leaders of the affected\ncountries have now called for\nthe installation of an early\nwarning system. This is too\nlittle, too late. It has emerged\nthat, for decades, they had\nignored scientific advice.\nSo the most shocking thing\nabout this event is not that\nit happened, but that many\ndeaths could have been prevented from happening. The\nchances are that if the same\ntsunami had approached the\ncoast of Japan, most people\nwould have been evacuated.\nSo who provides the\nanswers in the face of such\ncataclysmic events? In centuries past, people used to\nexplain natural events by\nsaying that it was caused by\nGod\u2019s wrath or perhaps some\nother supernatural power. An\nAnglican priest was quoted as\nsaying after the tsunami that\n\u201cdisasters were part of God's\nwarning that judgment was\nimminent\u201d. A Muslim cleric\nhas said: \u201cThe disaster is\nGod's way of testing humankind.\u201d Little consolation, little\nsolace for the victims.\nIn the Abrahamic religious\ntexts, there are numerous\nnatural disasters such as\nfloods and plagues of locusts\nthat were caused by the wrath\nof a supernatural bogeyman\n(as that prophet of science\nRichard Dawkins so often\nputs it). Today, however, we\nhave a better understanding\nof how such events occur. We\nknow exactly how tsunamis\noccur and we also know why\nthey occur. We also have the\ntechnology to predict when\nthey will occur, and we could\nhave saved thousands of\nlives. We also know why there\nare global economic imbalances and why so many people live in poverty and do not\nhave access to the information that should have saved\ntheir lives.\nSo the answer is that there\nis absolutely no excuse. The\ntsunami disaster was a global\ncatastrophe and this time we,\nnot God, are all responsible.\nAre you going to say in the\nface of the semi-formed cries\nOf their expiring voices, in\nthe face of the spectacle\nOf their smoldering remains:\n\u201cIt is the effect of necessary\nlaws\nThat require this choice of a\nGod that is free and good\u201d?\nExcerpts from Poem on the\nLisbon disaster, Voltaire\n(1694-1778)\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 6 January 2005 7\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Anushri Patel\nPhysics department\nWhen asked to name a prominent scientific equation,\nE=mc\u00b2 comes to mind. A\nhundred years down the line,\nthis equation still echoes the\nscientific brilliance that was\nEinstein.\nAs a schoolboy, he was\nnever regarded as a \u2018genius\u2019, but at the age of just\n26, Albert Einstein had published three papers in a\nrenowned German physics\njournal that made him one\nof the most legendary scientists of all time. The papers\nfocused on Brownian motion,\nthe photoelectric effect (for\nwhich he won the 1921 Nobel\nPrize in physics) and special relativity. These papers\nwere published in 1905 and,\nin that memory, 2005 has\nbeen named the World Year\nof Physics.\nMore than 40 physical societies around the world will\nbe taking part in the celebra-tions. In Europe alone, the\nUK and Ireland, Austria,\nCroatia, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Poland and\nSwitzerland will be just some\nof the countries involved.\nAmongst the participating\ncountries outside of Europe\nare South Africa, Australia,\nKorea, India, Malaysia,\nPakistan and the USA. This\nis very much an international\naffair!\nAs the UK and Ireland\u2019s\ncontribution to the world\ncelebrations, 2005 will be\nknown as Einstein Year. This\nis being co-ordinated by the\nInstitute of Physics, and hundreds of events and activities\nthroughout Einstein Year\nwill promote physics to the\ngeneral public.\nEinstein Year will be focusing on motivating young people about physics, dispelling\ncommon myths and highlighting the contribution of\nmodern-day physics to soci-ety. Activities will encompass a range of contemporary physical concepts, from\nmeteorology to gravitational\nwaves. Events will also be\norganised locally by schools,\nuniversities, museums and\ncommunity groups to make\nphysicists, and the work that\nthey do, more visible to the\npublic. Einstein Year is also\nsupported by many well-known celebrities, including\npersonalities such as Carol\nVorderman and Sir Patrick\nMoore.\nAs well as events run\nby local groups, there will\nalso be some national outreach activities for secondary school pupils. The programme is still under devel-opment, but current plans\ninclude a poetry competition,\na Rambert Dance Company\nproduction, a paperclip physics competition, a lab in a\nlorry and an international\nposter competition. Science\nWeek also takes place during\nmid-March, and many of the\nactivities during that time will\nbe physics-related, including\na celebration of Einstein\u2019s\nbirthday on 14 March! Check\nout www.einsteinyear.org/\nevents for further details and\nto find out what\u2019s going on in\nyour area.\nYou can also get involved\nby organising your own\nevents, and if you have\nany fantastic ideas, email\neinsteinyear@iop.org with\nyour plans!\nEven if you don\u2019t have any\nplans of your own, you can\nvolunteer for various activities set up by other socie-ties. PhySoc will be running\nplenty of events throughout\nEinstein Year, so get in touch\nand volunteer. You\u2019re bound\nto find something you\u2019ll enjoy,\nand I guarantee it\u2019ll be interesting and fun!\nScience, religion and a\ncase of history repeated\nForces of nature:\nhow tsunamis form\nBy Tom Simonite\nScience communication\nAlthough most commonly\ndepicted and imagined as\ntowering waves with a foamy\ncrest, tsunamis are actually\nmore like a rapidly rising tide\nable to quickly and forcefully\nflood coastal areas. They do\nnot have a developed wave\nface like the typical ocean\nbreaker. The reason is the\nvery different ways these two\nkinds of ocean wave are cre-ated.\nIn the same way that blowing on a cup of tea causes ripples to form, a normal wave is\ncreated by the action of wind\non water. Wind travelling over\nthe ocean creates ripples on\nthe surface. These give a better \u2018grip\u2019 on the water so the\nwind can have a still greater\neffect. The stronger the wind,\nand the greater the distance\nit blows the waves across the\nsurface, the larger the waves\nbecome. The distance a wave\nhas travelled is called fetch\n\u2013 the larger the fetch, the\nbigger the wave. British surfers flock to the north Cornish\ncoast, where the waves have\ntravelled across the expanse\nof the Atlantic. The English\nChannel is markedly less\npopular.\nWhen an underwater earthquake occurs, a very different\nwave is generated. The movement of the sea bed displaces\na large amount of water. In\nthe case of the Boxing Day\nquake, hundreds of cubic kilometres were rapidly shifted\nas the seabed jumped several\nmetres upwards. Despite the\nscale of the disturbance, the\ntsunami would have initially\nbeen undetectable from air\nor sea. While tsunamis travel at around 450 miles per\nhour, they have a wavelength\nof hundreds of miles and an\namplitude of just a few feet.\nAlthough it is the peaks of\nthe wave that cause destruction on reaching shallow\nwaters, the troughs often get\nthere first. In many places\nhit by the Boxing Day tsuna-mi, the first sign was a rapid\nand dramatic receding of the\nwater to expose hundreds of\nmetres of sea bed. A large\nnumber of people who ran\nto get a closer look at this\nunusual phenomenon, or to\ngather fish stranded by the\nretreating sea, were early victims of the subsequent wave.\nWhen tsunamis move into\nshallower water, their amplitude increases as the leading\nedge of the wave is slowed\nby friction with the sea floor\nand the rest of the wave piles\nup behind it. The decrease\nin speed is more marked,\nalthough, as amateur videos\ndramatically testify, the waves\nstill move much faster than a\nperson can run. The increase\nin size is not a large one \u2013 the\nlargest wave to hit shore on\nBoxing Day was 30 feet high,\nwith most much smaller.\nUnlike Hokusai\u2019s depiction of the \u2018Great Wave Off\nKanagawa\u2019, tsunamis are more like rapidly rising tides\n2005: a year dedicated to physics\nFeynman, Einstein and Newton\u2019s ideas will be celebrated during 2005, the year of physics\n\u201c...motivating young\npeople, dispelling\ncommon myths and\nhighlighting the contribution of modern-day\nphysics to society\u201d\n\u201cWhile tsunamis travel\nat around 450 miles\nper hour, they have a\nwavelength of\nhundreds of miles and\nan amplitude of just a\nfew feet\u201d\n\n"
