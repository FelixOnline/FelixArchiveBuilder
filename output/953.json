    "content": "Felix 953\n'eat ure15 January 1993\nOut of the Ashes...\nPhillip Henry resurrects Imperial's old flame\nThe Phoenix is the Imperial College\narts magazine, a magazine of high\npedigree which was established in\nthe last century by H.G. Wells and\nhas continued in one form or\nanother to this day. Alas, its\nfrequency has dropped off of late.\nIn theory, it should appear once\nevery year but, there was a two year\nperiod of gestation before the last\nand no editor has been assigned to\nthe task of producing the next.\nDespite one person volunteering\nfor the post (namely, Samin Ishtiaq\nwho contributed a large amount of\nmaterial to last years Phoenix) it\nmust be publicised so that others\nmay, if they wish, aspire to the\ndizzying heights of Phoenix editor.\nThe position offers a great deal\nin the way of exercising one's organisational abilities,\ncommunication skills and, for those\nof a more artistic bent, one's creative powers, while those of a more mercenary disposition will\nfind that the editorship of the\ncollege arts magazine looks great on\nyour CV. In addition, you get to\nknow, love and work along with the\nincredibly talented, motley\nindividuals that make up the Felix\ncrew. As if all this were not enough\nto entice you to volunteer for the\npost, though it be a veritable wealth\nof features, you also get a tankard\nwith your name engraved on it! You\ncan even drink out of it if you're\nfeeling par i cula rly brave.\nHowever, life is not all rosy for\nthe Phoenix editor; it has to be said\nthat there is a lot of work involved.\nNot too much as to force you to\ncompletely abandon your degree -I just about got a21 last year - but\nthere is still a lot of work. But, this\nis not the worst, oh no. The worst\npart of the job is, aside from the\nworthy few who spoil you for\nchoice with their material, trying to\nget five thousand apathetic sods to\ndo something artistic - a story, a poem, a photo... anything. Not an\neasy task; in fact it's downright\nfrustrating to be honest, but I'm afraid that will be your lot.\nAll of these trials and tribulations\nare outweighed, however, when at\nlast, after months of anxiety and\nlabour, your baby is finally\ndelivered and hundreds, maybe\nthousands of copies are printed,\ncollated and sent out into the big\nwide world. When thousands of\nminds are reading your work, there\nisn'ta thrill to compare.\nI now proffer an example of the\nkind of poetry that has made recent\nPhoenices. It's not necessarily\ndepressing laments on the theme of\ndeath, its inevitability and bleakness\netc. On the contrary, the more\nsimple submissions tend to be the\nmost memorable. For example, I 've\nbeen asked to provide an extract\nfrom an old Phoenix and having\nread the past ten or so this clever\npoem by anjana ahu j a stands out.\nMr. A. Hall\nMy Albert has been sitting thus, Ere\nmy life here begun, Each dusk he's there observing, The setting of the sun.\nMy Albert's very tall you know,\nExtremely wide and round, Although\nI'm sure he'd bellow well, He doesn't make a sound.\nI like to sit and watch my Albert,\nFrom my little home, His head is so\nprecisely curved, It's almost like a dome.\nTo weather he seems immune, I 've\nnever seen him flinch, Come rain,\nsnow, hail and sleet, He doesn't budge\nan inch. He sits so steady and so\nstaunch, So purposeless and still, He's never moved while I 've been here, An\nI guess he never will.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Music\n1 5 January 1993 Felix 953\nLise Yates and MacCarter huddle around a raging\nfire and tell their grandchildren of the strange\nhappenings during the winter of '92\nLet me explain. We've done it\nbefore, we'll do it again. Come hell\nor high water, at Christmas,\nMcCarter (who will write in italics),\nand I, Lise Yates, celebrate by\nexposing ourselves to as much\nmusic as our banks will take. So\nwhere did we start this year?\nThe Camden Palace, favourite\nhaunt of Tuesday's indie kid, and\nhalf to population of Osaka. On\nstage, the band who should've been,\nThat Petrol Emotion.\nUnceremoniously dropped by\nSatan's alliance with EMI, they're\nnow the band with no label. Finely\ncrafted songs drifted from the stage\nand I stood, captivated.\nSweet Jesus have been compared\nto Suede by the music press.\nMusically they are not the same.\nNeither do they look the same. They\nare not the same, and what's more\ncomparing these two is rather like\ncomparing John Major to Saddam\nHussein and claiming that both are\nenigmatic world leaders. Got it?\nWhereas dear old Brettfrom Suede\nlooks comfortable with his\napparently ambiguous sexuality, Mr\nS.J. has the aura of an adolescent\ndressed in his mother's underwear\nfrightened to really let go in case\nshe should return unexpectedly from shopping at Tesco. The same sad\nfigure on stage looks like a man who\nreally has no confidence in what\nhe's doing. Quite appropriately\nthough, the rest of the band behind\nhim seem equally unimpressed. In\nshort Sweet Jesus have an\nappearance on \"The Word'. An\nAustrian friend of mine hits the nail\non the head, \"They're very boring\naren't they?' he offered. I had no\ninclination to disagree. Whatever\nyour religion, pass this lot by on the\nother side.\nFriday night. Two weeks after the\nFactory shut down for good, the\nfirst of their ex-bands to re-emerge\nassemble on the stage. Some of\nthem apparently oblivious to their\nnew found label-free status. Jez (to\nrhyme with Bez) of the Adventure\nBabies, for it is they, is resplendent\nin a Factory t shirt. The Adventure\nBabies' greatest achievement, for\nthose of you unaccustomed to their\nwork, is to have their album cover\ncopied by Madness, (cf: 'Laugh',\nZark was slightly puzzled by his rather prominent position on the music\n'Madstock'). Opening with\n'Wheelaway', seems to be another\n'Fac You', the lines 'giving up my\nhouse...', and sprinkling a few new\nsongs through the set; they're not\nfinished yet.\nReturning to College, I'm faced\nwith a dilemma. Geno Washington\nor Herb. Some dilemma. Dexy's hero didn't stand a chance. Herb's support, were better than I expected; a lot better than I expected. Still, I had only expected\nto have this un resist able urge to\ntransport myself to the bar. They\nstopped me in my tracks, tried to\nkill me with thirst. Very Ride, very\ngood.\nBut not as good as Herb. Herb for\nthose of you who have remained\nignorant of their charms through\nmisfortune or dogged perversity,-are the bright light in all Essex,\neclipsing even Charley The Cat's Prodigy and, the curiously silent of\nlate, Blur. Herb are closer to the\nlatter, with a curiously good\nsongwriting ability, one which is\nably demonstrated in such songs as\n'Beatsugar' and the absent without\nleave 'Never Say Dinosaur'.\nIf the phrase 'Oz's finest' could\never be considered a compliment,\nthen it must go to Bjorn Again.\nIgnore, if you will, their Christmas\nattempt, as it shows very little of\nwhat they're about. They are about\nAbba, and at the Town & Country\nClub they are resplendent, complete\nwith numerous costume changes, a massive set, and giant letters from\nErasure's1989 tour for their\nversions of ' A Little Respect' and\n'Stop'. 'So what if at least half the\naudience were in false beards, in\ncase of recognition by a casual\nacquaintance in Kentish Town? I was there, and I'm not afraid to\nexplain why: It's fun, a whole lot\nmore fun than certain nineties\nmiser ab list bands I could name.\nA lot more fun, too, than the\nworld's worst hypnotist. Thousand\nYard Stare put him on stage,\npresumably to implant subliminal\nmessages like 'you will buy our\nalbum' in the minds of the faithful.\nOn the other hand, it maybe just to\nprevent their fans from suffering\nmore than twenty minutes of Brian,\ntheir main support band. Brian are\nin fact more successful at inducing\nsleepiness than any hypnotist. Were\nTYS worth the wait? Probably, if\nonly to hear '0-0 a et' and 'Come\nUppance' played very loudly.\npages\nBesides, any band that gives out\nfree sweets and party things can't be all bad.\nSpeaking of bad, and I realise\nprobably ranks as one of the worst\nconnections of the decade,\nsupporting The Farm at the\nrescheduled Astoria gig, were Big\nAudio Dynamite...\nHatred is not a word one might\nnormally associate with a musical\nopinion. No matter how I try though\nI have to confess that I do indeed\nhate Big Audio Dynamite for not\nleaving the stage earlier. What's more lam filled with loathing by the\nway they then returned to do an\nencore that absolutely nobody asked\nfor. This evening at the Astoria was\nnot about hatred though. Infact had\nI let my hatred slip out and become\na shout of derision I would have\nlooked positively out of place. And\nso, begrudgingly I try to calm\nmyself a sI'm told for the umpteenth\ntime that I really ought to have more\npatience for BAD U. 'After all Mick\nJones used to be in a great band'.\nQuite simply, Mick Jones is no\nlonger in a great band.\nDespite being deprived of an\ninterview with the Farm at the last\nmoment I have infinitely more\nPage 12\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews15 January 1993 Felix 953\nTheatre\nMadness in Valencia\nLope de Vega, who wrote this play\naround 1600, was a well known\nwoman is er in the high society of\nMadrid. His writings were well\npublicised by his behaviour and the\nlegal prosecutions against him. So\nafter being flagrantly indiscreet\nabout his desires for the wife of a powerful Duke, he was exiled for\nten years in Valencia. Madly in\nlove, and mad with the Duke he was\ninspired to write Madness in\nValencia.\nThe whole plot takes place in the\nHospital of the Innocents, the\nworld's first sanatorium. This place\nwas the first attempt to create a centre where madness could be\ntreated as a curable illness.\nThe scandals and mad escapades\nof the main hero Floriano and his\nfriend Leonato have obvious\nresonances with de Vega's personal\nlife. The play is a fast-moving love\nstory which presents the adventures\nof two lovers who take refuge in the\nsanatorium. Passionate love and\ninsanity are compared along with\nsociety's definition of madness and\nwhat it accepts as sanity. Madness\nfrom outside and inside the\nsanatorium is displayed for our\nlaughter and pity.\nMadness in Valencia, being the\nlast play in the series of six plays\nfor Europe, continues the excellent\ntradition of the productions at the\nGate Theatre. The cast, as usual,\nare exemplary.\nGeorge\n\u2022 The Gate Theatre, 11\nPembridge Road, W ll, Notting\nHill tube. Box Office 071-229\n0706. Tickets \u00a34-\u00a38..\nDonizetti Variations,\nWitchboy, Les Patineurs\nThe three ballets performed by the\nLondon City Ballet at Sadler's Wells were somewhat\ndisappointing. Donizetti Variations\nwas saved from mediocrity by a graceful and exciting performance\nfrom Eva Evdokuniova. Witchboy,\noriginally a ballad, tells of a mountain community, dominated\nby a fanatical preacher, who\nbelieved in creatures who gave birth\nto witches. Les Patineurs follows\nthe events of an ice skating party.\nIt is generally well performed and\ncertainly very colourful.\nSonia.\nThe Lion, The Witch and\nthe Wardrobe\nEveryone should know this classic\nstory inside-out. Then why the first\nhalf hour is presented in a muddled\nfashion will baffle most people. The\nreason for this is that the set, and\nI use the term set very loosely, takes\ntoo long to change.\nThe changing of scenes however\ndoesn't spoil your enjoyment of the\nPanto. But be warned! There are\nnone of the 'Behind yous' and sing-a longs that are in your usual Panto.\nThis is more like a show than a Panto. But why is it advertised as\na Panto?\nExcellent performances can be\nseen from the characters of Asian\n(The Lion), The White Witch, Lucy\n(youngest member of the family),\nEdmund (spiteful bastard of the\nfamily) and Maugrim (a disgustingly evil wolf). But these\nare shadowed by the disappointing\nsound effects and the dingy set\nwhich needs more than a little\nre-think.\nP. Tentious\n\u2022 Royalty Theatre, Portugal\nStreet, WC2, Holborn tube. Box\nOffice 071-494 5090. Tickets\n\u00a310-\u00a314.\nThe Nutcracker\nGuaranteed a full, uncritical house\nfor the whole Christmas run the\nEnglish National Ballet take the\nopportunity to present the shoddiest\nNutcracker I have ever seen. I doubt, if any of the taffeta-ed six\nyear olds in the audience will want\nto return to this ballet every\nChristmas since, as I have done.\nBen Stevenson's new choreography\nis ugly, banal and boring.\nPepita/Ivanov's was not.\nTchaikovsky was a talented and\nknowledgeable composer for the\ntheatre, Stevenson is not. From\nwhence has come this licence to\nhack the score to pieces and cobble\nit back together\u2014cursing soloists\nwith marathons or sprints?\nMaybe I would've been more\nreceptive to the changes had they\nbeen well executed but, even in the\nsimplest steps the corps de ballet\nwere messy, half-hearted and\nhampered by Desmond Heeley's sets. Monstrous carcasses and\nmasks crippled the battle of Rats\nand Soldiers into a hobbling frenzy,\nblizzards beset the Land of the\nSnow and the Land of the Sweets\nbecame the Republic of Vulgaria.\nThankfully soloists Thomas Edur,\nRenata Calderini and Agnes Cales\nprovided some beautiful, sensitive\ndancing amidst the mayhem.\nSara\n\u2022 Royal Festival Hall, South\nBank, SE1, Waterloo tube. Box\nOffice 071-928 8800. Tickets\n\u00a35-\u00a320.\nThe Lion the Witch and the Nail\nExtensions...\nMr Cinders\nThe Kings Head continues to dazzle\nwith forgotten gems polished to\nwonderful productions. The latest\ntreasure is the 1929 musical-comedy-role-reversing-Cinderella-story Mr Cinders. Sam West,\nbewitching as the put-upon 'poor\nrelation' Jim (Mr Cinders) heads a sterling cast on a delightful skip\nthrough some vintage 20s clich es. The tiny stage is alive with\ningenious sets and ingenuous\nchoreography which together with\nthe sheer nerve and ebullience of the\ncast detract from some quite feeble\nsinging. Vivian Ellis's music and\nGreanex Newman's words have an\nenchanting ease and sparkle from\nthe childlike 'Spread a Little\nHappiness' to the Flanders-and Swan esque 'On the Amazon'. This\nshow deserves a West End transfer\nbut see it at the Kings Head where\nit is an honour to be in and audience\nalmost as small as a cast who sing,\ndance and act their hearts out.\nSara.\n\u2022 Kings Head Theatre, 115\nUpper Street, Nl, Angel/Highbury\nand Islington tubes.

    "content": "'eat ure15 January 1993 Felix 953\nFuture Phones call to Students\nTanya Nazim and Trish Dooling advertise the front line of phone technology\nbeing brought from the USA to Princes Gardens\nImagine not having to fumble in\nyour pockets for coins or a phone card the next time you use a telephone on campus. Imagine\nbeing able to phone home or\nanywhere else from College at\nanytime without having to worry\nabout having the correct change. It\nsounds good, doesn't it? Well,\nthanks to modern technology, easier\nand more convenient telephoning is\nat your fingertips in Southside.\nIn the USA, roughly 80% of\ncolleges have an internal\ntelephoning system whereby, with\nthe use of a pin-number, any\ntelephone on campus can be used to\nmake a phone call. The call\nautomatically results in a bill made\nout to the caller. Therefore there is\nno hassle with money at times\nwhere it may not be convenient.\nThis year, plans are being made\nfor such facilities to be extended to\nthe UK. And what makes it even\nmore exciting is that the first place\nin the whole of the UK to receive\nthis is none other than the Southside\nHalls in Prince's Gardens.\nResidents of these halls who\nsubscribe to this system will be able\nto dial a number, put in their\npersonal authorisation code and\nmake a phone-call.\nThe company introducing this\nsystem is ACC Long Distance UK Ltd a subs i die ry of ACC Long\nDistance Corporation. This is one\nof the largest independent long-distant carriers in the north eastern\nUnited States. It is also one of the\nlargest carriers in Canada.\nAn experimental period begins\nfrom January 1993. From this time\nonwards, subscribers will be able to\nuse the facilities and, ACC hopes\nalso produce as many suggestions\nas possible. As the company will\nhave a help desk in Southside and\noffices in High Street Kensington,\nstudents will be able to voice their\nviews easily. Originally expansion\nhad been planned for the first term\nof next year. However, due to\noverwhelming student demand, the\ntelephone service has been\nexpanded to any student residing in\nPrince's Gardens who wishes to use\nSoufhside extensions to place thier\ncalls. Additional campus extensions\n9 HH HH H have been installed in the lounges\nfor PAC calling convenience.\nThe student will receive a special\nACC card with identification and\npart of PAC( Personal\nAuthorisation Code) on it. The\nremaining portion of the PIN\nnumber will be provided separately\nto avoid the problems of stolen or\nlost cards.\nShould a card or pin-number be\nlost, however, reports would have\nto be made immediately to ACC customer service. This could be\ndone at any time by calling\nextension 6025.\nThe benefits of this system\ninclude the fact that ACC charges\nare 10% less than BT coin or card\nphones. Some people may argue\nthat Mercury costs even less. Well,\nthe point is that in the local area\nMercury costs only 1 % less than\nBT. Overseas calls can also be\nmade by using PAC. Another\nimportant benefit, is that any\ncampus extension within Southside\ncan be used to place calls so, a student is less likely to queue to\nplace a call, as is currently the\npractice with BT payphones.\nBills will be sent every month to\nthe caller where each call is\nitem is ed. Ideally, each subscriber\nwill have stated at the beginning of\nthe term roughly how much he or\nshe would spend in a month. If bills\nexceed the expected limit before the\nmonth is over, ACC will contact\nthem to let them keep track of how\nmuch they are spending. However,\nno deposit is required.\nIn addition to the standard 10%\ndiscount, ACC is offering an\na ddt ional cheque rebate of 10% the\ntotal term billing, returned at the\nend of the year if all phone bills are\npaid on time. Students who pay on\ntime can save as much as 20%.\nThis entire project is sure to\nprove extremely exciting for the\nwhole of the UK as well as\nSouthside. This is the beginning of\na whole new telephoning system.\nEventually subscribers will be able\nto utilise the system outside\ncampus. Subscribers will also\nreceive, upon request, pin-numbers\nfor specific phone numbers, with\nthe help of these, they may call that\nnumber from selected countries\nabroad.\nIn most colleges in the USA,\nthere also exists an 'Affinity Card'.\nThis is a security 'swipe' card,\ntelephone card and credit card (for\nshops on campus) all rolled into\none.\nAs the communication network,\nbehind the scenes, eventually\ndevelops and expands more, such\nbenefits will be made available to\nPARACHUTE\nJUMP in March\nfor Multiple Sclerosis pick up your sponsorship\nforms from the Rag Office\nPage 10\n\n"

Now he had\ns over. The day had been long,\nmaybe too long. He was starting to\nlose the edge and he knew it. The\nincident in the common room had\nbeen close, maybe too close. It was\nonly his quick reflexes, a little luck\nand a clean shot with his pistol that\nhad saved him there. It was a stupid\nmove to check his internal post, a mistake he would not make again.\nAt least now he knew who was after\nhim.\nOn reflection, the day had been\ngood. Three kills to his credit\nalready and it was only Monday.\nThe first two had been standard\npistol shots, but he had taken pride\nin the third. An aerosol can with the\ntop taped down and 'Gas Grenade'\nwritten on the side. He'd thrown it\nthrough the open window while his\ntarget inside had been doing\nproblem sheets. He remembered the\npleasure he'd had knocking on his\ntarget's door and asking his target\nto sign his death warrant.\nIt was late now. He needed a good night's sleep so he could be\nup early to wait for his next target\noutside Chem Eng. He stopped\noutside his room. Even this late in\nthe day he could not be too careful.\nHe readied his pump action shotgun\nand slowly pushed the door.\nCrouching down he peered round\nthe edge of the door. Even in the\ndim light he could tell that the room\nwas clear. It was such a relief. He\nhadn't really realised how on edge\nhe'd been until now. Now he was\nsafe.\nOn Friday 29th Jan we kick off Rag\nWeek in the best way possible -RAG Carnival. Taking over the\nUnion in a manner similar to the\nFreshers' Ball, the Carnival is going\nto be massive this year. More than\njust a party, this event is BIG, with\nlive bands, a disco and a Barfly.\nAnd with all the proceeds going to\ncharity, it's just the job for getting\nrid of any stray grant you have left!\nHe made a last check, put the\ndraft exclude r against the door to\nstop any attacks from there, and\nwalked slowly across the room to\nthe window. That was when the\nringing started. It took him a minute\nor two to find the package. It was\njust under his bed. It was a small\nbox with an alarm clock in and\n'Time Bomb' written neatly across\nthe top. How it had got there he\ncould only guess. But the long and\nshort of it was that he was now\ndead. Just as he realised this there\nwas a knock at his door...\nKiller - there's nothing quite like\nit. The idea is simple: on signing\nup, you are given a target to\neliminate. Once eliminated, you\nproceed to eliminate your target's target, and so on. All the while,\nhowever, you are trying to avoid\nbeing killed by your own killer,\nwho may change when they are\nkilled by their killer. Confused?\nNever mind, take part anyway. It's great fun and there are CASH PRIZES for the most inventive kill,\nand the Survivor. To find out more\ncome along to the Rag meeting on\nFriday at 1.10pm in the Ents\nlounge, or contact Andy Wensley\nin the ICU office. The cost is only\n\u00a32.50 and two photos of yourself,\nso take part!\nAMENDMENT To all those football fans out there\nthat signed up to collect at the QPR\nv Man Utd match on Saturday 16th January: the match has now been\nchanged to Monday 18th January.\nDon't be disheartened - I am\nreliably informed that this should be\nan exciting match as Man Utd have\njust gone to the top of the league.\nCome to today's Rag meeting to\nsign up if you haven't already done\nso.\nWhat does it feel like if the room\nsuddenly turns upside down and you\nare left standing on the ceiling? Can\nyou lean on an elephant that isn't really there but that you can see? Is\nit possible to hy p not is e someone to\ndo something they wouldn't otherwise do? These and many\nmore questions answered at one of\nthe most fun and interesting events\nof the year. Martin Taylor, a professional hypnotist, gives a short, humorous talk on hypnosis in\nthe first half of the show. Then,\nafter everyone has grabbed a quick\npint in the Union during the\ninterval, the second half is your\nchance to get up on the stage and\nfind out just what he's been on\nabout. Those of you who have been\nbefore will know to come again, but\nfor anyone who hasn't buy your\ntickets early, this show always sells\nout! It's Thursday 4th Feb in the\nGreat Hall (cos it's the largest room\nwe can get), and tickets are only \u00a33,\navailable from the Union Office.\nYes, the advent of Rag Week\nheralds the approach of that\ninfamous event - the Sponsored\nNude Kamikaze Parachute Jump.\nAll it involves is a tiny jump from\nthe back of a minibus outside\nHarrods, and a quick sprint back to\nCollege. What could be easier?\nWell, okay, there is a slight snag -you are only allowed to wear a parachute harness and boots! This\nevent should appeal to all you\nexhibitionists out there, so if you\nhaven't already picked up a sponsor\nform you can do so TODAY at the\nRag meeting or from the Rag\nPage 6\nR Felix 953\nag\n15 January 1993\nSERVICES\nYou have probably read about such\nthings as Gnoming, Handcuff-a grams, and Grim-reaping in Felix\narticles before Christmas (you\nremember - that lovely holiday that\nflashed past you at 150mph and left\nyou standing in your lecture theatre\nlooking dazed and at the start of a whole new term!). Services are\nbasically a means for you to get\nyour own back on anyone who has\nremotely annoyed you this year.\nGet your roommate handcuffed to\nsomeone they loathe, and they may\nwell retaliate by having you\nfollowed around by an irritating\nlittle gnome until you pay them\nenough to go away. Guilds will also\nbe running their Hit Squad again,\nso watch out for these experts of the\npie. If you'd like to liven up your\nlecture in a different way, you could\neven have a pint- a gram delivered\nto your lecturer!\nRemember that Rag week comes\nbut once a year and is the best way\never invented for making lectures\nsilly. We do rely heavily on you to\nhelp us do this, though, so if you\ndon't mind missing a couple of\nlectures then sign up and give us a hand with a flan or two. To\nvolunteer your services as a gnome\nor grim-reaper, sign up in the RCS\nOffice. For the Hit Squad, go to the\nGuilds Office, where you can also\nobtain immunity (at a price!) and\ncontact lens wearers can pick up a badge to protect them from flan s in\nthe face.\nDIRTY\nDISCO\nI'93 Rag Conference '93\nMonday 1st February in the\nUnion.Yet another opportunity to\nget your kit off for charity, the\nMines Dirty Disco runs on slightly\ndifferent lines to a normal disco.\nBasically, the less you wear the less\nyou pay - and yes, some people do\nget in for free! However, if wearing\njust a bow tie to a disco isn't your\nkind of thing, then wear the whole\nsuit and just come along for the\nentertainment - this is always a great\nlaugh!\nWhile all you lazy bod s where still\nsleeping off your hangovers from\nNew Year, 14 slightly nutty people\npushed off to Manchester for a few\ndays of fun and frolicking with\nother like-minded people. We were,\nof course, not at a mass orgy but\nnot far off it at Rag Conference '93.\nConsisting of seminars on how to\nrun and improve our Rag. The\nConference lasted three days, each\nnight ending with a social event (eg:\nHypnotist,Bungee running,\ninflatable boxing and Gladiator\nDueling) and a disco. The seminars\n(a very boring word for what was\ngreat fun) were given by\nexperienced Raggies from all over\nthe UK and Eire. Our very own\nPenguin gave two very sucessful\ntalks on Silly Ideas and How to get\nStarted. All of our Raggies now are\nwell clued up on how to make Rag\nMORE FUN, MADDER and\nSILLIER FOR YOU. As well as\nthat they all had a great time and left\nkeen to work and motivate. With all\nour new found knowledge Rag\nWeek is going to be as to rmer for\nall involved and that includes you.\nLast year Rag was discreet but this\nyear Rag will be\nUNAVOIDABLE!!!!\nOffice. If you need an incentive to\nstrip then there is a prize for the last\nnude person back to College.\nRachel Mountford (Rag Chair) has\npromised to do the SNKPJ if she\ngets over \u00a3300 in sponsorship! If\nyou don't have the figure or the guts\nto do it yourself, please sponsor\nanyone you know who does - and\nthat goes for any of the crazy events\npeople are doing during Rag Week,\nfrom doing a stair climb up Canary\nWharf to dressing up as Noddy or\nBig Ears.\nage\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 953\nMUS1 C15 January 1993\npatience for the amiable sco users. Even when the clock reaches eleven\nthirty and they still haven't taken the\nstage I am relatively calm. The last\ntime I saw the Farm they were\npelted offstage with cow dung at the\nReading Festival, since then they\nwere dumped off the Madstock bill\nthanks to Morrissey and their last\nLondon gig lasted just 55 seconds\non Friday the 13th. Earlier today\nthey had flown in from LA at 3am and up until two hours before\ntonight's gig I was reliably informed\nthat they were all asleep in their\nhotel. Oh dear, not quite the setting\nfor a classic. As it turned out, it\nwasn't exactly a classic, but then if\nyou want classic, go see Phil\nCollins. The Farm somehow always\nmanage to create a bloody good\nmood when they play, not the sort\nof mood that makes you want to\nexplode with dance energy or get on\npeople's shoulders and punch the\nair but a mood that somehow makes\nyou believe in the world again. It\nsounds a bit heavy, I know, but I still believe that if all the world's leaders gathered in one place and\nlistened to 'All Together Now'\nthere'd be the biggest 'love-in' since\nMandy Smith invited Bill Wyman\nround to help her with her\nhomework. I can't believe how good\nthe vibe was in this place after only\nhalf an hour or so. When it started\nto snow at the end I just wanted to\ndie right there and then. Honestly,\nis there more to life?\nJames were on the Factory label\nonce. This, of course, is prehistory.\nBesides, James have been on most\nlabels, but Factory will be missed\na great deal more than the doomed\nT&C, where they played for us\ntonight what was announced as an\n'acoustic' performance. What it\nactually was, wasn't much different\nto their other shows, apart from the\nlack of the trumpet player, who has\nleft for pastures new. What we hear\nis 'Johnny Yen', 'Sound', and 'Sit\nDown', during which the audience\nthankfully remain on their feet.\nWhat we don't hear includes 'Come\nHome, 'Lose Control', 'How Was\nit for You?'.\nThe whole essence of this gig\nreminds me of Tori Amos' rendition\nof Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen\nSpirit'. Suddenly the rawness is\ngone and a different kind of mood\ntakes over. Where was anger comes\nmild rebuke, where was energy\ncomes a mild tingly sensation and\nwhere once were cast away words\nare now heart-felt paeans. The only\nproblem is you can't bloody well\ndance to it can you ? The last thing\nanybody in the T&C on this festive evening wanted to do was hold\nhands and sway gently...people\nwanted to dance. Iam definitely not\nThe first and last time Metallica will ever appear in an issue of Felix\nimagining this. At even the slightest\nof up tempo moments in flute solos\nthe audience prepare to crowd surf\nand stage dive only to be\ndisappointed when moments later\nsilence prevails again. If you ask me\nthis was a clever rip off. At eleven\nquid a ticket and not even having\nto break sweat the band will be well\npleased with the evening's earnings.\nPrepare yourself for the Napalm\nDeath tour of selected poems and\ncanticles.\nSaturday came around once\nmore, and Voice of the Beehive\nround off a low key tour of assorted\ndives around the country, ending up\nin the dive of dives, the Marquee.\nWith appalling sound, and\noccasional stage lighting to contend\nwith, the band do a fine job,\ncovering Zodiac Mind warp's 'Slut\nFreak' and, after much shouting\nfrom a determined section of the\naudience 'Sit Down'...\nThe Frank & Walters are\nbrilliant. I 've said it before and I'm saying it now, but lest you don't believe me, here's a second opinion\nfrom someone new to their work...\nThe Family Cat can be bearable,\nas shown at Glastonbury, it's just\nat these shows, they, how you say,\nweren't. Since this third on the bill slot\nwith Carter, The Franks have gone\non to much greater things. Top of\nthe Pops to be precise and I predict\nthat in the next twelve months they\nwill have three number one singles\nand a platinum selling album in 14\ncountries around the world. To say\nthe least they are the brightest,\nboldest, poppies t new band to\nemerge from1992 and anyone who\ndoesn't seize upon them before they\nbecome fashionable is missing out.\nBugger Suede, The Frank &\nWalters have infinitely more right\nto be crowned the Best New Band\nin Britain. 'After All' is easily the\nbest thing in the top 40 and already\nI'm in danger of being agreed with,\nas it soared to number 11 in the\nnational chart yesterday. The\nFranks have everything that a pop\nband should; matching orange\nboiler suits, matching wooly\njumpers and even matching\nhaircuts. They're between song\nbanter is as it should be, nothing\npoignant, no world challenging\negos, just total and utter gibberish.\nWonderful stuff.\nThe Family Cat were bloody\nawful. Itpains me to say so as only\nsix months ago I half-hearted ly predicted an up-turn in their\nfortunes. As 1993 looms-in I wholeheartedly retract that statement.\nEVERYBODY else in here has\ncome to see Carter tonight. I'm even\nwilling to place ate nner on the fact\nthat Carter is EVERYONE'S favourite band except mine. There\nare exceptions to every rule though\nand tonight all the exceptions were\nup in the VIP bar watching and\nlistening through noise muffling\nplastic windows. I too was more\nthan happy to not suffer the full\neffect of Carter's performance. I guess I 've just seen it all once too\noften, mildly memorable songs\nshouted across at blank faces that\ndon't really care what the people on\nthe stage are saying. Yes, the lights\nARE bright and the decor WAS very\nfestive but the fact that Carter's last\nalbum ended up in the top 10 of\nmost despicable things of 1992\n(Melody Maker) is enough to\nconvince me that the hospitality\narea has more to offer.\nCarter have gone too far. They\nare one stop away from Stadium\nrock. This, of course, means\nnothing to their legions of fans, who\nstill shout 'You fat bastard', a year\nto the day since Jon Beast last\nappeared on the stage with them;\nfans who say 'the sound's good\ntonight', when it was in fact\nmurkier than the air in LA; fans\nwho reward every predictable\nmention of 'Brixton' with the\ncheapest cheer possible. They,\nwhen asked would say 'they were\nbrilliant'. The truth is too far\nremoved from that to credit anyone\nwith that belief with any judgement\nat all. Not that I dislike Carter. (Oh\nno?) I like their songs, I like their\nalbums, I like their wordplay. I love\n'Billy's Smart Circus'. BUT. I want\ngood sound, I want involvement, I want to feel that the band are trying.\nI don't want my most pervasive\nmemory of the night to be 'what is\nthe riff from the McEwan's advert\nwith the big ball, doing in the\nmiddle of 'Sherrif Fatman'?'.\nage\n\n"

Despite the long absence\nfrom the RSC's stage enforced by\nthe making/directing/starring in\nfilms such as A Month in the\nCountry, Henry V, Dead Again and\nPeter's Friends (soon to be voted\nthe most 'luv y' film of '92), young\nKen still seems to know how to use\na stage.\nDesigner, Bob Crowley was\npretty adept too, setting the action\nforward a few hundred years to the\nbeginning of this century in an\nEdwardian reign although sending\nHamlet off to England via Elsinore\nStation somehow failed to convince\n(it was, at least another excuse for\nsome obligatory dry ice). The\nbreathtaking 'play within a play' set\nin Act III with a sumptuous\nvermilion auditorium sweeping\nskywards was, on the other hand\nspectacular, although, as it was used\nfor the whole act, this also had to\ndouble as Gertrude's bedroom.\nThe plot was not Shakespeare's own and although the outlines of it\ncan be traced back to one of the\nGreek tragedies, there is a story in\nDanish legend of Amleth way back\nin the 12th century.\nTS Eliot took a rather dim view\nof the scenario in infamous\ncriticism:\nWe must simply admit that here\nShakespeare tackled a problem\nwhich was too much for him. Why\nhe attempted it at all is an insoluble\nproblem; under compulsion of what\nexperience he attempted to express\nthe in express i bly horrible, we\ncannot ever know.'\nBut then, what would you expect\nfrom a man whose name is an\nanagram of 'TOILETS'.\nDirection from Adrian Noble\n(who was responsible for the RSC\nHenry V) paced the play mostly at\nan astounding rate in order to fit the\nunabridged version of one of\nShakepeare's longest plays into just\nunder 4V4 hours\u2014any longer and\nconcentration would have begun to\nseriously wander.\nOnly the power of the cast kept\nthe attention and after the strength\nof the support in Kenneth\nBrannagh's own production of\nHamlet on Radio 3 this summer\nincluding Judi Dench, John\nGeilgud, Emma Thompson (of\ncourse...) could have led to\ndisappointment. John Shrapnel's mean uncle Claudius exuded evil to\nalmost pantomime proportions but,\nmirroring this with moments of\nhorrifying calm, kept the character\nwithin the bounds of possibility.\nJoanne Pearce's Ophelia swung\nbetween the polarities of an\ninnocent sister, confused lover and,\nafter her father's death, lunatic (she\nplayed a pretty good corpse too)\nwith rare ease, completely\nconvincing in her bereaved\nmadness. Polonius (David Bradely)\nbristled bureaucracy from every\npore, allowing the comedy of his\nverbosity to come searing through\nthe text and Laertes (Richard\nBonneville) acted out his part as a pawn in Claudius' hands, ignorant\nof his monarch's sins. Rob Edwards\nas Horatio was not, as often is the\ncase over-shadowed by the\ncharacter of his friend, so his final\nspeeches, after Hamlet's death were\nnot at all an anticlimax. Clifford\nRose's Ghost of Hamlet's father,\nhowever, was frankly a disappointment. Striding around in\nthe opening scenes, he looked like\na kind of Darth Vader in negative\nand obviously belonged to the\nschool of thought which holds that\na sense of the seriousness of the\n'a ago nee ey' of his 'faa a a ate' is best\nimparted by speaking with a silly\nvoice.

    "content": "o pinion\n1 5 January 1993 Felix 953\nDear Jonty,\nSaturday night, the 28th November was the night which all\nSingaporeans ought to be proud of,\na night in which the Singaporean\nflag flew high. 'Singapuro Exotica',\na variety show involved practically\nall Singaporeans at IC (about 90 of\nthem), with five months of vigorous\"\npractice, was a huge success.\nI wish to take this opportunity to\nlook into several points which I feel\nstrongly about:\n1. The overall quality of the\nshow was high. Much effort and\nenergies had been channelled into\nthe experimental multi-media\nperformance, which is\ncommendable. The show was\nsuccessful in recreating an\nallegorical journey through the last\ncenturies of Singapore, as well as\nthe colourful cultural performances.\nThere is one sincere rationale\nbehind this versatility. The\nobjectives of the show were to\npromote the interchange of cultural\ninterest and at the same time,\nintroduce the country to the\ninternational community.\nThe success of the show should\nbe seen as a beacon of achievement\nto encourage further emulation to\nthe international community.\n2. The positive at t it ute of the\nSingaporean. The Sing. Soc has\ncome a long way, from overcoming\nthe conceptual hurdles to the final\nproduct. To pick up just one of the\nmany examples. Weeks before the\n'Singapura Exotica', a daily stall\nwas set up in the concourse area of\nthe Sherfield Building, and was\nbacked up by a performance of a precision drill in the JCR. Its final\nattempt to boost the ticket sales was\nretarded by the unfortunate incident\nwhich brought the overseas week to\na premature close. The sale of the\ntickets was less than satisfactory,\neven until 24 hours before the actual\nshow.\nThe imminent disaster, however,\ndid not de moral is e the Singaporean.\nAda und ess spirit, best put by Baron\nde Coubertin, 'the essential thing in\nlife is not conquering but fighting\nwell', was shown by all. Luckily,\nthe show was a great sell out.\n3. The role of the overseas\nstudent in promoting their\nrespective cultures. For many\ncountries, large sums of money\nhave been invested in expensive\nprogrammes for development of the\nhuman resources to the highest\norder. One such programme is the\ncontinuous sending of students to\nstudy in technologically advanced\ncountries, like Britain. It is\ntherefore of paramount importance\nthat these 'elite' should shoulder the\nresponsibility of promoting their\nrespective countries and cultures, as\nwell as the pursuit of academic\nexcellent. For one thing, each and\neveryone is the most qualified\ncultural ambassador of the country,\nand speaks better than any tourist-guide brochures.\nI was fortunate to have a brief\nencounter with the Minister of Arts,\nCulture and Tourism of Malaysia,\nduring his official visit to this\ncountry three weeks ago. He\nexpressed great interest when told\nthat the Malaysian society was\nputting on a cultural performance.\nHe even offered much advice and\nsent his best wishes to the\nparticipants. The point I want to\nmake here is that, quite often, these\nstudents are unaware of the\nexpectation and importance attached\nto such cultural activities by their\nfellow countrymen.\n4. The implication of such\ncultural activities in the broad\nsense. With about twenty five\npercent of students from overseas,\nIC students enjoy the privilege to\nhave the opportunity to explore\nother cultures in depth. Cultural\nactivities as such provide forums on\nthe cultural pursuit and\nachievements of their countries.\nConstant contact and exchange of\nculture would engender mutually\nenrich e ning cultures. I do believe\nthat, through such interchange (or\neven exposure) would widen one's mental horizon, and enable one to\nperceive things in a fuller context.\nThis should form an important part\nof self-education.\nMy stay in the UK is coming\nclose to four years. Over the years,\nBritain (and the British) has taught\nme more than just Elgar's 'Pomp\nand Circumstances' or Yorkshire\nPudding. Such exposure has\nprovided me with, at least, the\ngeneral conception of the 'cause and\neffect' system, e.g. why the British\nlive the ways they live etc.\nAs communication revolution-is es, distances shrink, political\ngeography transforms and\neconomies lose their border. In the\nadvent of globalisation, an\nawareness of the importance of\nbetter under sanding through the\ninterchange of cultures, is the first\nstep towards achieving a comprehensive vision of the world.\nIt is through activities such as these\nthat promotes the interchange of\ncultural interests, and maintains\ninternational/inter-racial goodwill\nand harmony. It is hoped that\neventually a globalised, fra c tern al culture will pave its way in the years\nto come.\nIn conclusion, I would like to\nurge students to take the initiative,\nwith an open mind approach to such\nactivities. Ignorance breeds\ncontempt and probably casts\nstereotypical views on other people.\nDon't let introversion over-ride\nyour consciousness.\nFinally, I would like to express\nmy gratitude to all participants,\nwhose effort has brought us a most\nenjoyable night.\nYours sincerely,\nHM Kho, Civ Eng 2.\nCrossword\nAcross\nI.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 U U1 il Issue95315 January 1993\nImperial Alzheimers\nBreakthrough\nby Declan Curry\nAn Imperial researcher has\npredicted that a cure for Alzheimers\ndisease may soon be discovered. Dr\nGareth Roberts, Senior Lecturer in\nAnatomy and Cell Biology at St\nMary's Hospital Medical School,\nwas commenting on this week's research breakthrough which shows\nthe why and where of the disease.\nAlzheimers disease currently\naffects almost 350,000 people in the\nUnited Kingdom. The disease has\nbeen known to develop in a person\nin their early fifties, and those\nabove eighty are at a higher risk of\ndeveloping the dementia. Dr\nRoberts' research links the onset on\nthe degenerative brain disease with\nhead injury and old age.\nThis week's research focuses on\nthe presence in the brain of a small\nmolecule known as beta amyl oid precursor protein. This protein\nnormally helps repair and maintain\nnerve connections in the cortex\nregion of the brain. According to Dr\nRoberts, Alzheimers disease may\nbe caused by the presence of too\nmuch of this protein in the brain.\nBeta amyl oid precursor protein is\nproduced if the head suffers a serious injury, or if the head is\nrepeatedly damaged. Such injury or\ndamage is known as head trauma,\nan everyday event which results in\nover 100,000 hospital admissions in\nthe United Kingdom every year.\nLong term survivors of head\ntrauma, such as boxers, have high\nlevels of beta amyl oid precursor\nprotein in the brain, and many of\nthese develop forms of dementia in\nlater life. Dr Roberts' team at St.\nMary's have been investigating a possible link between Alzheimers\ndisease and head trauma by\nstudying observations from 16 head\ninjury cases.\nSpeaking on IC Radio, Dr\nRoberts said that brain neurons\nwhich are first affected by\nAlzheimers disease tend to contain\nmore beta amyl oid precursor\nprotein than other neurons in\ndifferent parts of the cortex.\nAdditional amounts of the protein\nare produced around the age of\nfifty, when the neurons undergo\n're sprouting'. Dr Roberts claimed\nthat the combination of the\nadditional protein with the existing\nprotein 'triggers the disease\nprocess', and described the\nre sprouting period as 'the critical\ntime for developing the disease'.\nDr Roberts said that the research\nhad 'pulled together a lot of threads\nand really focused our attention on\ncontrolling the protein'. When\nasked about a possible cure, he said\nthat 'people are actively identifying\ncompounds even as we speak, and\ngreat strides forwards would be\nexpected any day now'.\nThe research has been welcomed\nby Alzheimers sufferers support\ngroups. Clive Evers, of the\nAlzheimers Disease Society, said\nthe work was 'significant' in\ndeveloping the understanding of the\nlink between Alzheimers disease\nand the aging process. \"The one risk\nfactor we do know about in relation\nto Alzheimers disease is the aging\nprocess,' he said.\nby Gareth Light,\nNews Editor.\nChris Davidson,Imperial College\nUnion President, invited members\nof the University of London\nGeneral Union Council (GUC) to\njoin with the Imperial College\nUnion in a breakaway council with\nhimself as chairman. Mr Davidson\nwas reported by several senior\nsabbaticals of other Unversity of\nLondon Colleges to have been\ndrunk when he made the statement.\nMr Davidson was reported to be\nextremely critical of the level of\ndebate in the GUC, saying that it\nwas 'inaccessible' to its members,\nand so did not serve its purpose. He\nallegedly claimed that the new GUC\nwould not suffer from the same\nproblems and would resolve the\ndifficulties that the current\norganisation suffers from.\nIn an interview with Felix, Mr Davidson said that he 'definitely\nwasn't drunk,' and that he 'made\nsome valid points' at the meeting.\nAt the last Imperial College Union\nCouncil meeting - when questioned\nabout his comments by a Felix\nreporter - he is reported as saying\nthat he spoke against aUL U motion\non the break-up of the University\nof London because he considered\nthe motion premature. Mr Davidson\nsaid that no firm proposal for\nde federal is ation was on the table.\nHe has made no comment on the\nbreakaway Council since.\n6 / 7\nRag\nwarm-up\n9\nHow many\nbroken?\n11\nOut of the\nfire\n12/13\nXmas music\nround-up\n\n"

The book has its\nown unique style which to some\nextent defies classification: The foil\npackaging, the metal cover, and the\nshear size of the thing. This is not\na book that can be discrete ly hidden\nin your pocket.\nThe media have given 'Sex'\nenough hype to make people think\nthat it is nothing but pictures of\nMadonna, naked, by herself, and\nsometimes with other people doing\nun-heard of things. For some parts\nof the book this is completely true,\nthat is until you are confronted with\none the numerous pages of text.\nThese present themselves in three\nmain forms: The first of these is the\ntext on a blank page or with a picture behind it. These pages reenforce the idea that pornography/\nsex/reading dirty literature makes\nyou go blind since the font for these\npages is large and bold. The content\nof these pages vary from deep and\nmeaningful observations about sex\nand love, to Madonna's childhood\nconfusion about sex, to graphic\naccounts of her waking up to the\nfeeling of her lover 'taking her from\nbehind'.\nThe second type of text appears\non a page covered by small and\noften meaningless pictures, with the\nscrawled writing positioned just\nabout anywhere. The content is\nsimilar to the above, but takes\nlonger to read since at least half of\nit is undecipherable without close\nexamination.\nThe third and possibly funniest\nCyberpunk by Katie Hafner &\nJohn Markoff\nI hate it when people blame\nmachines. After all who made the\nmachines? So when people use the\nmachines and do things with them\nthat others don't like are they\ncommitting an offence? What if it's something that its not supposed to\ndo?\nComputer security and law are\nvague areas at the best of times and\nthis book chronicles three examples\nto illustrate it. The accounts range\nfrom experiments that went wrong,\nthrough to determined intrusion.\nOne common trait through the\nstories is the 'weirdness' of the\nperpetrators. This does nothing to\ndispel the stereo-type of the lone\nbespectacled figure hunched over a gleaming hot machine. Also, its\nnarrative style presets the facts in\na rather inhuman manner, only\nbriefly dealing with the morality of\nthe people's actions.\nThe technical content of the book\ntype is in the form a letter, written\nby Dita (Madonna pretending to be\na mistress), to a character known as\nJohnny. In the letters, she basically\npleads him to see her as much as\npossible, since she misses his dick.\nThe letters contain a few ways in\nwhich Dita and Ingrid (the ugly,\nshort-haired bitch from Justify My\nLove and the Erotica video), relieve\ntheir sexual boredom.\nThe pictures are what Madonna\ndescribes as her fantasies and these\ninclude; group sex, whips, leather,\nwearing no clothes in public places,\nwearing very little clothes and\nparading around erotically, wearing\nquite a few clothes but having them\ntaken off by hunk y males and\nwearing kinky clothes but grabbing\nher crotch. Most of them are,\n'interesting' I think is the word, and\npossibly funny to look at, except a selection which last for four pages.\nThese are Madonna 'with' that\nw anker of wan kers, Vanilla Ice.\nGone are the shavings on the side\nof his head but this still doesn't change the fact that he is aw anker. So, is it worth \u00a325? For Madonna\nfans such as myself, I think it is.\nYou get an amusing 6-odd page\ncomic at the back, a version of the\nsong 'Erotica' on CD, which is only\navailable if you buy the book, plus\nyou get the book itself. If you're\ncurious as to what all the\ncontroversy surrounding this book\nis about: simply ask someone with\na copy for quick look (NB A quick\nlook can last about half an hour).\nFor the perverse: spend the \u00a325 on\na bunch of porno mags and/or a couple of dirty videos.\nHard Harry\nis low so perhaps for people that\nhave heard the scare stories in the\nmedia it may prove enlightening. I suppose they couldn't have put\nmore information in for fear that\npeople might try it out.

    "content": "R Felix 953\ne views15 January 1993\nTHE BODYGUARD\nWhen looking to see who was in the\nBodyGuard, and then viewing the\nname Whitney Houston, my\nimmediate thought was along the\nlines of 'Oh shit, not another pop\nstar attempting to get into films!' I then expected a performance so\nwooden that the furniture in the film\nwould seem to have more life in it.\nTo my surprise I was not only\nspared such a dreadful performance\nbut Whitney did exceedingly well\nin her first film role. She remained\non top form throughout, as too did\nKevin Costner (shock of shocks),\nwho played the bodyguard to\nWhitney.\nThe storyline, while tense,\nexciting and romantic, eventually\nleads down to a disappointing\nending that might have all softies\nsqueezing a tear. It has to be said\nthough that this is the film's only\nflaw.\nHels\n\u2022 Throughout London already.\nAlone? Depressed? Need Companionship? Try Dateline, it can work for you too.\nTheatre\nL.627 Here is an earthy, uncomplicated\nlook at a police narcotics team in\nParis. It's a gentle, gritty study on\na violent and seedy subject. In the\nmain, it's about the life and drive\nof a man who is trying to implement\nLaw 627. Here is a man with a mission. There's no plot as such, no\nglamourous thrilling detective\nwork, but some scenes stand out\nand some stay with you awhile. It's a difficult film for subtitles due to\nthe realism of the dialogue, though\nit's not the dialogue that carries the\nfilm. It's hard to say what does. Not\nsurprisingly, the acting is very good\nespecially Didier Bezace as Lulu.\nInconsequential is the word that\ncomes to me. There is no happy\nending for the police or the junkies,\nbecause there is no ending. Maybe\nI'm pessimistic but the film seems\nto confirm the idea of that there is\nno solution. For junkies, dealers,\nscreaming babies with spaced-out\nmothers. Sad but true.\nDarwen.\n\u2022 Opens Lumiere Friday.\nThe Adventures of Mr\nBroucek\nThe setting is Prague, circa 1920.\nThe central character, Mr Broucek,\nis the landlord of an apartment\nblock; he is fat, coarse, oafish, and\ndisliked by his tenants. The tenor\nGraham Clark carries the role\nexcellently\u2014slapstick, acrobatics\nand singing combined.\nThe production is a characteristic\nproduct of ENO's resident team of\nDavid Pountney, producer, and\nStefanos Lazaridis, designer. It's full of ideas, some hits, some\nmisses, and fans will not be\ndisappointed; the motifs of mid-air\nbeds, horses and expressionist sets\nare back again. In the past, I 've\nbeen annoyed by their tendency to\n'over-produce', their ideas\nintruding on the central music and\ndrama. Here though because the\nmusic is relatively weak the\nproduction is the thing that gives the\nperformance life.\nThis being the pantomime season\nENO are promoting Broucek as a family opera, suitable for all. This\nmay be true of Act I: the humour\nis a bit superior, but everyone can\nappreciate the weird, bright\ncostumes and scenery. Act II is a different kettle of fish. Children,\nand more than children, will be\npuzzled by the symbolic goings-on.\nHardly 'Aladdin and the Three\nBeakstalks' at the Penge Coliseum,\nbut worth seeing.\nPlinthos.\n\u2022 The London Coliseum, St\nMartin's Lane, WC2 N4ES, Charing Cross tube.

However, judicial\ncancelling by the 2nds allowed the\nl sts to take 13 players to Willesden\nStadium and the challenge of our\nmedical half-brothers.\nIt is said that if you dig a grave\nin the rain, it feels like your own.\nA similar experience can be visiting\nWillesden Stadium, 2 hours before\npush back in the driving rain with\nviolently swaying floodlights and\nthe cracking concrete of sixties\narchitecture.\nFunnily enough, the first fifteen\nminutes of the game showed\nsomething of the cracking formation\nof a team out of fitness and position.\nSt Mary's had the consistent\npressure and were only let down by\nspasmodic shooting (and Simon the\ngoalie of course). However we\nmanaged to claw back some shape\ninto our play with help from the left\nside of midfield. Finally we were\nlucky enough to convert a somewhat innocuous chance from\nthe golden stick of Dave Fairhurst\n(the star of stage and screen). Thus,\nheartened we held on until half-time\nand a welcome rest for our legs.\nStarting the second half, we\nbuoyed in action and quickly scored\nagain, thanks to the phantom\nwobble of Captain Goatie. From\nthat point, the game was over as a spectacle. We scored twice again as\nSt Mary's suffered a cardiovascular demise at the heart of\ndefence\u2014Samin and Dave (again)\nadding the vital touches.\nAs the game dragged into the\nclosing stages. St Mary's resuscitated enough to finally stick\na chance away and score. Quite\nwhat happened in the defence, who\nknows, it probably had something\nto do with Simon's aversion to clean\nsheets (only 1 in 16 games). Still it\nkeeps him humble.\nMany thanks to the flying\nDutchman, Martin, for staying\nafloat long enough to umpire for us,\nand the second team player who\nrelieved our distress.\nPublic announcement: St Mary's have in no way been s lagged off.\nTeam: S Curwood, M Helayel,\nI Haines, D Parkinson, J Cooper,\nJ Jordan, D Brooks, S Ishtiaq, M Farshaw.

We started with the wind on our\nside and still they put one over the\nline. We came back with a storming\ntry from no.8 Simon Fuller shortly\nafter Melvin Aguh had keenly run\nthrough to the dead ball line. The\ntry was converted by the Wind and\nAdam Wood, who had a harder job\nkicking in the second half when we\nwere facing the wind. The pack\nmade a good effort against a stronger opposition, with the return\nof the regular pairing of Matt\nToolin and Simon Wilkinson to the\nsecond row.

But, hang on a minute, we have all heard Kelvin\nMacKenzie, Andrew Neil and Peter\nPreston sounding off about their\nrespective newspapers, some of\nthem even spoke exclusively to\nImperial College Radio, surely we\nhave had too much about this issue.\nBut, gentle reader what do you\nthink, you who go out and spend\nyour grant cheque on these papers,\nwhat do you think, are you even\nworried that freedom of the press\nis about to be seriously curtailed?\nDo you think that the media has\nbrought this fate upon itself? And\nare you even bothered?\nIt is easy to criticise the papers\nthat you read for harassment,\nmis reporting and bias, yet you still\nread them, even at Imperial College\nI have no difficulty believing that\ntabloid papers are by far and away\nthe most widely taken. Can we\ncriticise papers who print pictures\nof naked royals, when we go out\nand buy them? It is us who\nencourage this behaviour, when the\ngreat and mighty battle this one out\nin TV, Radio and Newspaper, bear\nin mind what you want to read and\nif you would really be effected by\nchanges in the law. Make your\nvoice heard before it's too late.\nTotes Toasties\nHave Totes Toasties a controlling\ninterest in Christmas? The brightly\ncoloured thermal sock was the main\nChristmas present to the entire\ncountry, everyone I know got a pair. Do they control all the\ngrannies and aunts that have no idea\nwhat to buy you for Christmas? Something is up and I recommend\nthat they are investigated by the\nMonopolies and Mergers\ncom misi on for more than a20% control in the festive season.\nWanted\nFelix offers the chance to see\nevery play or film in London,\nbefore it is released to the general\npublic. It remains a source of\nconcern that this is not jumped upon\nby every student here. Because\nthere is only a limited number of\npeople in the Felix office at any\ngiven time, we have too many\nevents and too few people to cover\nthem. This means that opportunities\nfor free tickets get needlessly\nwasted and the pages of your\nesteemed college organ become\nempty white space, or facile waffle.\nYou can help rectify this\nsituation, all it requires is for you\nto walk through the door to the\nFelix office in the left hand side of\nBeit Quad, and ask for Sara, Mario\nor Jonty. The rewards are without\nlimit, and the price, just a little bit\nof self confidence.\nCredits\nNews; Gareth (News Ed.)

I sit at the word-processor, my fingers are frozen\nabove the keyboard, twitching as\nthey anticipate to jump to a certain\nkey. Frantically scanning my mind\nfor a topic, the only one that I manage to locate is lunch: a jacket\npotato, with some coke (the drink,\nthat is).\nI could blame the start of term\nexams. This would be a feasible\nproposition if significantly more\neffort was put into them. I could\nblame the holidays, arguing that I had revised like mad or completed\nmountains of work, but alas, I can't. Wait, an idea! I think I 'll write\na bit about last year's Cat's Eyes.\nAll the top notch journalists reflect\non the previous year's work at the\nstart of a new year, so why not me?\nOK then, so can I remember what\nI wrote, without referring to past\nFelices? Hmmm. One subject that\ncropped up more often than not was\nthat CCU mag. A childish argument\nbegan when it published a one page\npiss take of Felix. The not-much-of-a climax of this quarrel came at\nthe end of the term when, after\nrefusing to be interviewed by them,\nthey demonstrated how to fill blank\npages with a photocopier and an\nissue of Felix.\nOne of the subjects I regret\nmentioning was about space-filling.\nSince then, some of spaces that have\nhad to be filled in Felix were done\nso that it was deliberately obvious\nthat that space had to be filled. At\nthe time I felt I was partly to blame\nfor this. Anyway, now I see that\nthere is nothing wrong with the\noccasional space filler. Nope. Not\na thing. Absolutely now t wrong\nwith that masterful, creative,\ningenious technique. No, it's not a technique, but a skill, yes a skill,\nthere is absolutely now t wrong with\nthat masterful, creative, ingenious\nskill in modern journalism that is\ncommonly known as space-filling.\nI think that's enough about the\npast since I have little space left to\nmention two subjects that have\nemerged unexpectedly.\nThe first is censorship. Top Gun\nhas a certificate of 15, because of\nthe swearing and sex scene between\nTom Cruise and Kelly McGillis (or\nis it McGilis?). Then when it was\nadvertised as 'family\nentertainment,' and scheduled for\nan early evening screening, I became curious. What was a bloody\ngood film became something that\nlooked like it was put together by\na drunken production team: swear\nwords dubbed out, the voice over\nthat was provided for some didn't match the lip movement and the\nentire sex scene, such as it was, was\ngone. Why do ITV and the BBC\ninsist on chopping up films?\nChannel Four don't, but I think\nthat's because they need extras like\nsex scenes to attract viewers.\nWill the BBC hack up Parenthood\nthis Saturday? Will the scene with\nthe vibrator be cut? Although it is\non three hours later than Top Gun\nwas, you never know.\nI don't think I have enough room\nleft for a lengthy bit about\nsurrealism, the other emerged\nsubject. All I will say is that most\nsurrealism is generally rubbish and\nwhy are fish strongly associated\nwith this style of art?\nP.J.

How can it be\nthat you are the only one to make\npromises every year and then break\nthem moments later?\nTo prove our readers are not\nalone in wishing for, and failing to\nget the unattainable, Felix\ncommissioned a mini survey of the\ngreat and the good of Imperial\nCollege, asking what they had\nbound themselves to for the next\nyear.\nThe Entire College\nImperial, a college of the University\nof London gave a united\nundertaking to eat less chocolate in\n1993.
