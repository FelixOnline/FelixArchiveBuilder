    "content": "Opinion 23\nSTOIC - A Patio For Lively Entertainment\nDear Cat,\nYou may have noticed that the quality of\nstudent media at Imperial is in decline - we\nthink most of your readers know what we're on\nabout! Let me explain. No, we're not talking\nabout Felix but refer to STOIC. You may have\nheard of it; it's the small society that could be\nrun as the most successful media available to\nstudents, but instead is, on the whole, left\nvegetating on the third floor of the Union\nBuilding. Those who do use it are, to say the\nleast, technically minded (it is hoped that\nmembers will forgive our description of STOIC,\nbut most of them would agree that this is fair).\nIndeed STOIC is the best technically\nequipped studio in the country - solely for the\nuse of students - but less than 1% of students\nactually use it or watch it. With this recent\nmovement against apathy, as highlighted in this\nvery magazine by some chap pie in the Mechanical Engineering department and our good\nfriend Kyriakos Hatzaras (sic), other students\nmight want to take part in such a potentially\nsuccessful society that STOIC could be.\nSTOIC, although not over-bounding in its\nartistic quality, is exceptional in its technical\nproduction and, since its extensive refurbishment\nover the summer, a revival seems to be\nunderway! Mr Frank Bruno (and other cel ebs) have been interviewed and are currently in the\nediting stage (Channel 4 has expressed a keen\ninterest in broadcasting this one). After some\nrecent successes at the National Student\nTelevision Awards, a number of small films and\nother interviews are in the pipeline, about to be\nspewed out onto your screens. So maybe STOIC\nisn'tc abb aging after all?\nBut what else could be done about STOIC?\nTelevision production, as anyone who has\nwitnessed a TV show being made will agree, is a time and effort consuming process. To obtain\nresults worth watching, it needs full-time\ncommitment and attention to detail. This might\nexplain why STOICs creative output is often\nseen as less than satisfying and embarrassing.\nNo-one can expect, or is asking, STOIC members\nto devote such a large proportion of their\nacademic lives, slaving over a vision mixer. But,\nif Imperial wants to strike a balance between the\ninsular group to be found wandering around\napathy central and people whose extra-curricular\nactivities don't span beyond a soldering iron and\na Laplace transform, then we urge them to do\nsomething about it! Having just insulted the\napathy posse, we would like to say that these are\nexactly the people that we are looking for;\npeople with personality, energy and an\nalternative view of life. We appeal to them to get\ninvolved and make STOIC a flagship to be\nproud of - a patio for lively entertainment and\nthought provoking creativity!\nWe suggest that a sabbatical post for STOIC\nshould be created (after all Felix has one and\nalthough IC Radio doesn't, setting lights, sound\nand camera for each shot requires a great deal\nmore effort). STOIC is also responsible for\nmaintaining the TV cable network around\nCollege, which otherwise would not exist, or\nwould cost the College thousands of pounds to\nbe kept in service by professionals. We are not\nproposing this post so that people like ourselves\ncan live in hall and have something on their CV,\nbut there is a great potential here which could\nand should be used.\nPerhaps STOIC shouldn't just be limited to\nImperial. Most people will have heard of the\nLive-Net cable network set up by Imperial,\nwhich links other UL U colleges such as QMW,\nKing's, UCL, etc. As it stands, it costs the\nUniversity of London thousands of pounds in\ntechnicians' fees and equipment, which is hardly\nused. It could be put to another use: transmitting\nto and from these other colleges with live linkup programmes (similar to Channel 4's 'The\nWord'). A student television production company could be set up, allowing dedicated UL U students to get together and produce their own\nprogressive and distinctive television. This could\nbe a spring-board for such students to attain\nrecognition by people in the film/TV industry.\nSo the next time you see a STOIC poster,\ntant a lising you to become involved, don't think\n'Sad Twats of Imperial College', but get off\nyour indifferent behinds and do something to\nmake your mark at Imperial. Ask yourself if you\nreally want to miss an opportunity to host your\nown TV chat show, interview cel ebs, make your\nown film, your own music video...you won't get\nanother chance once you leave.\nIf you have any comments or suggestions\nplease don't hesitate to contact us, or go up to\nSTOIC and do something about it!\nJames Harrow Elec Eng II\nAnthony Waite Elec Eng II\nPlease note that the opinions aired in this letter\ndo not necessarily correspond with all STOIC\nmembers and is in no way expressed by the\nsociety as a whole.\nPolitics, Engineering & Peace\nDear Beccy,\nIt never rains, but it pours down like silver\neh? Precisely in the same week Gareth Davies\nwrites so concerned about the state of the Felix\nletter pages, out pop a tidal wave of liquid prose.\nCould it be media virus which actually works?\nBut like the ideological count contained therein,\nso the student writers of IC have some very\nnaive explanations of the world they live in.\nWhat's wrong with being career-obsessed?\nDespite the regular mention of such, I 've still\nyet to meet such. Isn't learning worth it anyway?\nDepending on which end of Sagar Das's article\nyou start from you get very different ideas.\nEither learning is the best thing to emerge from\nour mind's eye and it's also a terrible thing to\nwork hard at learning (to get a first at least?).\nThe combined talents of Hatzaras and\nAlexander are well meaning but adrift on an\nocean of hopeless optimism, surely. If the 20th century has taught us anything it's that\nnationalism is one of the strongest social forces\navailable. Any peace we can hope to achieve\nmust be within that framework, as David Owen\nis presently finding out.\nAs for Engineering being non-political, if\nonly. I'd reconsider my currently non-career\norientated future.

    "content": "2 News\nUnion Elections\nVoting in the C& GCU elections, pioneering the new swipe card system.\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nThe Imperial College Union sabbatical elections are underway.\nFollowing papers coming down last\nFriday, ten candidates are standing\nfor the four sabbatical posts. Those\ndeclared are: Kamran Bashir, Lucy\nChothia, Paul Thomas, Tim Brown,\nDan Look, Mark Baylis, Maria\nMoratis, Ian Parish, Owain\nBennallack and Joe McFadden.\nOnly one other candidate has\nstood since last week. Maria\nMoratis of Computing IV is standing for the post of Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies); she is proposed by Tim Parsons. Mr Parsons,\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nImperial College Boat Club christened their new \u00a311,000 boat on\nFriday. The boat, made by Ray\nSimms of Nottingham, was displayed at a reception held at the\nBoathouse in Putney. The ceremony\nwas attended by various members\nof College management including\nthe Rector Sir Ronald Oxburgh, as\nwell as the national boating maga-an Aeronautical Engineering post-graduate, was behind the critically\nacclaimed BBC programme\n'Cyberpunks and Technophobes'.\nSpeculation has arisen about the\nwithdrawal of Dave Cohen from the\nPresidential race. Sources close to\nMr Cohen have suggested that this\ncould be connected to departmental\nconcerns. He withdrew from the\nCity & Guilds College Union\n(C& GCU) Presidential campaign last\nyear due to academic pressures.\nThis week has seen the culmination of the efforts of the C&GC U to\nencourage informed voting. Guilds\ndecided this week to mail every\nC&GC U student with information\nzine Regatta. The boat was named\nthe 'Peter Mee' after the College's Assistant Registrar who was also in\nattendance.\nBill Mason, the Boathouse\nManager, told Felix: \"When we've\nhad internationals who haven't been\nable to afford to pay to attend\nWorld Regattas or Championships\nhe [Peter Mee] has always made\nsure that the money has been found\nto send the person. We're very\non voting. Speaking to Felix, Paul\nGriffith, President of C&GC U said:\n\"Initial comments have suggested\nvoters appreciate knowing what we\ndo. We've had a significant increase\nin postgraduate and overseas voters.\nThe swipe card system, apart from a few teething troubles, has proved to\nbe a success.\"\nIn what some observers have\ntermed, \"blatant copying\", Imperial\nCollege Union will also be mailing\nall potential voters before the sabbatical elections which take place\non 14th and 15th March.\nNew Election will be standing\nfor all posts.\ngrateful for how much he's helped\nus in the past.\"\nThe new boat will be used by\nthe mens first VIII as the club has a 'Best Boat to Best Squad' policy.\nThe club were also displaying\ntheir new minibus, donated by the\nHarlington Trust. Imperial College\nBoat Club continue to enjoy considerable success with their next major\nrace being the 'Head of the River'\nat the end of this term.\nSTEP Into\nShape\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nApplications are now open for the\nShell Technology Enterprise\nProgramme (STEP).\nThe scheme places second year\nstudents in eight week projects during the summer vacation with\ncompanies who employ less than\n200 people. They must complete an\nenterprising business project which\nwill bring a specific benefit to the\nhost firm. Projects are judged by a panel of experts, with the best\ngoing on to compete in national\nfinals. The overall winner gains the\ntitle of 'Most Enterprising Student'.\nThere are also award categories for\nBest Information Technology\nProject, Best Manufacturing\nCompany Project and Best\nEnvironmental Project.\nThe programme is organised by\nShell UK limited with the aid of a national network of 70 agencies,\nincluding Training and Enterprise\nCouncils and Local Enterprise\nAgencies. Over 1,000 students are\nexpected to take part this year.\nThe projects are intended to provide students with an opportunity to\ndevelop vital business skills such as\ndecision making, teamwork and\ncommunication. It also intends to\nforge closer links between businesses and universities. Many\ncompanies have gone on to recruit\nstudents who have worked with\nthem after they graduate.\nPlaces are available to second\nyear undergraduates, who are paid\n\u00a3100 per week (half from the host\ncompany). Students wishing to\napply to join the scheme should\ncontact the Careers Office in person\nin Room 310, Sherfield Building.\nSports\nLoan\nIn last week's Felix Charles Leary,\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties) was quoted as saying that\nthe Union took out a loan from the\nHarlington Trust to fund the Sports\nCentre's refurbishment. The quote\nshould have stated that the loan was\ntaken out by College, not the Union.\nNew Boat Christened\nCandidates' manifestoes are on pages 10 to 13\n\n"

We meet regularly on a Sunday\nafternoon in the East End of London to pay\ndevoted and loving homage to the idol of our\nenlightened lives.\nThe leader of our following could be\ndescribed as famous. He is certainly known to\nthousands of people all over the world and\npossibly other planets as well. He has entered\nmany people's lives and permanently changed\nthem. He gives a unique kind of peaceful inner\nstrength.\nI'm not talking about Freddie Mercury. I'm not lecturing about John Major, nor ranting\nabout my landlord, Mr Christian. I'm thinking of\nThe Great One, The Almighty, Our Inner Light.\nRolf Harris.\nNot many individuals know about this. I keep\nit fairly quiet. Not out of em baras s ment, I stress,\nbut out of respect for fellow humans. They have\nalmost certainly pondered the subject for\nthemselves and reached a non-participatory\nconclusion. I can leave it at that.\nThis respect is not forthcoming from some of\nImperial College's less well established\nreligious groups, who circulate and trundle\ninconspicuously about Imperial's corridors and\nwalkways.\nThis respect has not been afforded to me on\nperhaps five separate occasions in the last three\nweeks. Nowhere am I safe: the Sherfield\nWalkway, Beit Quad, 'Basics', the JCR...\nBeing regularly accosted by strangers and\ncajoled into giving my life over to God is not a new thing here. It started almost as soon as I arrived at this College. During my three years\nhere I have become more and more accustomed\nto this behaviour, but correspondingly more\nincensed by these persist ant and regular\ndemands for my soul.\nI know why these people pester me (and\nothers). The majority of my verbal attackers are\nmembers of the London Church of Christ, which\nis a modern cult (to use the tabloid term).\nMembers of this demanding organisation are\nrequired by the senior members to introduce as\nmany friends, a quaint ances or strangers into the\nChurch as they can, to further their standing\namongst their peers.\nSo they try and drag me in. Each of my three\nflat mates has been similarly approached. Tactics\nhave interestingly changed over the years.\nOriginally, afflicted people would approach and\nblurt out quickly \"Would you like to come to a Bible meeting on Tuesday?\" and look at me with\nbig, sad, hopeful eyes. Presumably a lack of\nfavourable response has led to a mutation. Now\nI'm engaged in innocent short conversations on\nthe subject of playing volleyball, or noise levels\nin Beit Quad, until my guard has been lowered\nand my accost er has built up confidence. But the\nsame desperate punchline is delivered time after\ntime.\nI am pleading with these people (you know\nwho you are) to leave us all alone. Put up\nposters, advertise in Felix, stand on a soapbox\nby all means, but LEAVE US ALONE!\nUntil I get this peace and respect I'm going to\nwear a badge saying 'Not Religious' and leave\nyou with some advice from the Old Testament,\nEccleiastes 5:2: \"God is in Heaven and thou\nupon earth: therefore let thy words be few.\"\nYou've been warned.\nBen Harvey, Mech Eng III\nCAREERS INFORMATION\nMilkround.

    "content": "18 Reviews\nExcel at Interviewsby Patricia McBride\nUse Your Head by Tony Buzan\nThe Fro\nWar\nExcel At Interviews attempts to outline the\nsecrets of interview techniques, but fails to tell\nthe reader the biggest secret of all, namely that\ninterviews are universally acknowledged as the\nworst method of selection known to mankind! I know from the management experiences I gained\nprior to becoming an (allegedly) mature student\nthat selection-by-interview has only a20% success rate compared to things like psycho-metric testing. And yet, the world and his wife\nstill rely upon the blessed things!\nExcel At Interviews trots out the usual guff\nabout dressing smartly (since when has one's dress sense had anything to do with one's ability\nto do a job?), overcoming nerves and avoiding\nslipping up on those deliberately embarrassing\nquestions specifically designed by sadistic\ninterviewers in order to make one feel like a total\nprat! It also offers tips on how to handle different\ntypes of interviewer, though there was nothing in\nit that would have helped me overcome the\nhandicap of being interviewed at Oxford by a tutor so pissed he could hardly stand up!\nThe question is, will Excel At Interviews help\na third year get that all important first job? 'No'\nis the answer though, if one thinks it'll do any\ngood, one can always borrow a copy of it from\nthe library. A book that will definitely help all\nstudents though is Use Your Head, by British\npsychologist Tony Buzan.\nBooks about mental development are usually\nwritten by American management gurus or\nEastern mystics. Use Your Head is different.\nLike that other champion of mental develop-ment, Edward De Bono, Tony Buzan bemoans\nthe fact that there are more professors of Sanskrit\nin the world's universities than there are\nresearchers working on developing the mind as a tool.\nCiting the case of Edward Hughes, a middle\nranking GCSE student who used the book's techniques to get 4 A grades at A level and a triple first at Cambridge, Buzan outlines a variety of techniques for faster reading, better\nmemory and time management. Stuck for an\nintro to your essay? Then try Buzan's MindMapping technique and you'll never be stuck for\na creative idea again for as long as you live!\nI speak from personal experience here. My first essays for Oxford in Philosophy and Politics\nwere dire. The following year, I applied MindMapping to them. The improvement was\ntremendous. The quotes were all in the right\nplaces, the arguments were solid and they\nseemed to be much more flowing. I still didn't get into Oxford, but that probably had less to do\nwith the quality of the essays and more to do\nwith the fact that the person reading them was\nout of their face on cheap liqueur!\nAt \u00a36.99, Use Your Head is the same price as\nExcel at Interviews, but this essential book for\nstudents is worth a thousand times more because\nthe talents one can potentially develop out of it\nwill mean that job interviews will be a dodd le. Shaun\nExcel at Interviews: Published by: Hobsons\nPrice: \u00a36.99\nUse Your Head: Published by: BBC\nPrice: \u00a36.99\ngs of by Andrew Harman\nIt seems that spoof fantasy is a popular genre.\nSince Terry Pratchett started the trend with his\nwidely acclaimed Discworld series, several\nauthors are now following suit. However, the\nfront (and often the back) of these new books\nnormally has some referral to or quote from\nTerry Pratchett which immediately incites the\nreader to compare the insides of the book to\nPratchett's works. Thus, it was in such a state of\nmind that I started to read The Frogs of War.\nAt first I did not enjoy it. The style was too\nsimilar to that of Pratchett. Descriptive wherever\npossible and using very visual and funny\nimagery for everything. However, once past the\nfirst few chapters, I settled down, started to\nenjoy the writing for what it was and really got\ninto the book. As with most works of this type,\nthere was a large amount of general mayhem\nand confusion, rowdiness, merriment, along\nwith some incredible names such as Arathoostra\nand Turgg Inyeff, all thrown together with just a pinch of magic. It is a good mix and works well.\nThe heroes (and heroines) of the book are\nyoung teenagers and the story seems to be\naimed at the same age group. I enjoyed it but\nfound that there were a few parts in the story\nwhere the storyline was thin and even puerile.\nOverall though, I found it entertaining but\nwould recommend it only to younger teenagers\n(or to those who are one at heart).\nGinster\nPublished by: Legend\nPrice: \u00a33.99\nEmergency General Meeting\nfor Imperial College Union\n1pm, Monday 7th March 1994\nEnts Lounge, Union Building\nItem Of Business:\nPassing The New Imperial College Union Constitution\nFor more details, contact Andy Wensley, Union Office ext. 3501\n\n"

From 1918 onwards he produced\nan uninterrupted stream of masterpieces,\nunder the influence of a passionate but\nplatonic re ation ship with a woman 38 years\nhis junior.

A race of genetically engineered Newcomers\narrive on Earth, take jobs and try their best to fit\ninto Earth's culture. But the dormant potential\nwithin them is about to be unleashed by the\nmurder of a cop on the streets of LA. Prepare\nyourself.\n8pm sees the start of the classic Planet of the\nApes. A crew of astronauts, thinking that they\nhave crash landed on Earth, climb from the\nwreckage only to find themselves on an\nunfamiliar world run by a race of highly\nintelligent apes. But even after their\nimprisonment and humiliation as test subjects\nand exhibits they are not prepared for the final\nsecret of the planet of the apes. Both films are\nfree to ics f members (see below for details).\nTuesday sees another video double bill, but\nshifted to the STOIC studios (top floor of the\nUnion Building). At 6pm we present The Omen,\nAs I scanned the pages of Felix a couple of\nweeks ago, my eyes caught the article 'Born on\nthe Fourth of February'. Having an interest in\nSri Lanka, I began reading it with great\nenthusiasm, but with every line my heart sunk\ndeeper on seeing Sri Lanka's multi-cultural\nhistory distorted by someone not fully informed\nof the true facts. I felt compelled to give the\nother side other story so that people can decide\nfor themselves if, in this modern age, the Tamil\npeople of Sri Lanka are indeed 'un liberated'. As the previous writer stated, it was on 4th February 1948 that the little island of Ceylon\nbecame an independent Sri Lanka and that is as\nfar as I can agree.\nThat writer begins by saying that it was then\nthat the Sri Lankan Government:\na) 'Decitizenised and disfranchised the one\nmillion Tamils living on the plantations.' What\nwas not said was that these Tamils on the estates\nwere brought from South India by the British to\nwork on the plantations and who were\npreviously stateless. Many thousands were later\ngranted citizenship by the Sri Lankan\nGovernment.\nb) 'Colonised Tamil areas with Sinhalese\nsettlers.' This is utterly untrue as the Sinhales\nare never allowed to settle down in the North.\nThe few that attempted to remain were\nmassacred purely because they were not Tamil.\nc) 'Enacted Sinhalese as the official language,\ndiscriminated against Tamils in employment and\nhigher e duct ion.' That statement is a fallacy\nbecause all students up to and including the ' A' Level classes are given the option to study in the\na story of what would happen if your son really\nwas the Antichrist. Riding tricycles in the house\nisn't the half of it as the Thorne household\nbecomes the source of a Satanic chain of events\ncentred on little Damien.\nThe horror continues at 8pm with Alan\nParker's voodoo thriller Angel Heart. Downbeat\ndetective Harry Angel is hired by the mysterious\nLouis Cyphre for $125 a day to track down a missing singer. But the fee increases as what\nstarted out as a straightforward missing persons\nhunt becomes a trail of ritualistic murders. Oh\nyeah, and Lisa Bonet like you never saw her in\nThe Cosby Show.\nBoth films are free to ics f members.\nMembership costs just \u00a33 and gets you free\nentry to our full programme of video double\nbills, the chance to borrow 3,000 books, videos\nand graphic novels from our library in the corner\nof Beit Quad plus reduced entry to out 35mm presentations including your first film free.\nTamil medium. Once in university the majority\nof degree courses, including Law, Medicine and\nEngineering are conducted in English. Contrary\nto what the writer claims, Tamils do hold vital\nand prestigious positions in the running of the\nnation. At least three Cabinet Ministers alone are\nTamil and they hold substantial power. Important posts are held throughout the country, the\nacting mayor of the capital is Tamil, as are\nmembers of the police force and Commanders in\nthe Army.\nd) 'State terrorism against the Tamil people.' I do not quite understand what is meant by what I assume is a reference to the army fighting the\nTamil Tigers, a terrorist organisation who have\nkilled thousands of people, not just Sinhales but\nTamils as well because they did not agree with\nthe violence the Tamil Tigers carry out. The\nterrible, bloody fighting during the summer of\n1981 was not coolly planned, but rather a violent\nreaction of some Sinhalese people to the\nslaughter of nine soldiers by the Tamil Tigers.\nThat article concludes that thousands of Tamils\nhave disappeared, but it has been found that\nmany of the so-called 'disappeared' Tamils are\nalive and well and living in the west under\ndifferent names or as refugees.\nIt is sad that the bitter politics of an island\nthousands of mile away is being perpetuated\nwithin this College.\nTonight is International Nite, an event that\ncelebrates each other cultures. It would be nice\nif that harmonious spirit could emerge and\nprevail among the Tamils, Burghers, Moors,\nMalays and Sinhalese, who all make up Sri\nLanka.\nRolling Along\non the Crest of\na Wave\nWell we would be except blades and roller-skates don't float. But we do get to Roller\nExpress each Tuesday night for a bit of skating\nto the music. From total beginners to those who\nare just too damn good, there are plenty of\npeople around to help you stay upright, go\nbackwards and even turn upside down (if you\nare that way inclined).\nAs the weather gets better we intend to move\non to some outdoor meetings too - maybe some\nfar off places and quite likely, a few rounds at\nHyde Park, too.\nTo find out more, we meet in Southside\nLounge at l pm on Mondays, or contact Dave\nCohen on 94-727 or Nick, Chem Eng 3 or Vicky\nOwen 94-802, Chem Eng 2\nP.S. Beginners, to go to Roller Express you\ndon't need your own skates, you can hire them\nthere for free.\nOSC Soccer\nAlthough it was a cold, wet afternoon, all of the\nquarter final matches were played with great\nenthusiasm. The African Caribbean team easily\neliminated the Indian Society 7-0, and the\nSingapore team beat the Malaysians by the same\nscore.\nThe other two quarter finals were much\ncloser. The Cypriot versus Lebanese game was\ncontested at a very rigorous pace. The game got\na bit rough at times, and ended with the Cypriots\nwinning 4-2.\nThe Iranian match against the reigning\nchampions, the Pakistani team was very close. It\nwas very tight in mid-field, and both teams had\na very good defence. After an early goal by the\nPakistanis, their star striker was shut out of the\ngame. The Iranian team played extremely well\nin the second half and won the match 2-1.\nSemi-Final Results\nAfrican Caribbean 2 - 3 Cypriot\nIranian 2 - 4 Singapore\n3rd/4 th Place Result\nAfrican Caribbean 5 - 3 Iranian\nFinal\nCypriots (by default)\nAn Independent Thinker\nThe International Nite Food Fair is previewed on page 5\n\n"

They have competed in the London\nCollege League Championship and the U AU Basketball tournament. The hallmark of the\nteam this year has been enthusiasm, dedication\nand an emphasis on good sportsmanship.\nAlthough consisting mainly of inexperienced\nplayers, IC have played with determination and\nin the process have shown what teamwork and\nteam spirit are all about.\nThe ladies team has diverse playing abilities\nand different nationalities. The only two English\nroses to grace the team, Sarah and Rebecca,\ndisplayed genuine Anglo-Saxon determination\nand grit throughout the season; the meticulous\nMartina strived for Germanic order; and Kristen\nbrought in Scandinavian height to tower over an\nunrelenting defence. In contrast the warm-blooded Mediterraneans, the skilful and agile\nConcha and the positively temperamental\nNatasha, raised the temperature during matches.\nThe imaginative sense of humour of the lively\nGhada and Lisa provided vital optimistic uplift\nand support on and off the court. There was\nOriental trickery in the deceptively diminutive\nShigeko, who demonstrated devious ability in\nher interceptions and Klara displayed solid\nperformances before leaving for the bridges of\nBudapest. The icing on the cake was the French\ncontingent, consisting of the steady Myong, the\nsharp shooting Sandra, and the sensational\n\"Shaq-attack\" Catherine.\nLast Thursday their efforts came to fruition\nwith the first league victory against Thames\nValley University ( TV U). Imperial overwhelmed TV U with a pounding 58 to 29 score-line, allowing only four baskets against them in\nthe second half. The ladies basketball team's performances this year can be summed up by one\nof the many complements received: \"IC deserved to win that match on team spirit alone.\"\nWindsurfing Weekend\nPHEW, what as to rmer! As previously reported\nin this literary piece of art, the Boardsailing Club\ntrundled down to Gosport for a weekend of fun,\nfrolics and a bit of aquatic skills.\nAfter a burst of stage-diving in the back of\nthe minibus we arrived at our caravan. The nightlife was poor, so we made our own entertainment\nfrom double sided sticky tape and beer.\nSaturday was set aside for sailing which gave\nample time for any external body parts to\ndisappear. Our main goal for the weekend was\ncompleted though. This was testing all recently\nbought kit and preparation for the British\nStudent Championships. These are held on the\nweekend of the 30th April to 1st May, and are\nintended to be for windsurfers of all abilities,\nwith the social side of the weekend catered for!\nAfterwards we watched rugby, ate chilli and\nplayed pool. As we all know, a weekend is a game of two halves and we awoke to a snow\nExploration\nOn Thursday 10th March, David Edwards,\nChairman of the Exploration Society, will\ndescribe how he and three other students from\nImperial College made the first ever descent of\nthe River Nyong in Cameroon last summer.\nThey successfully combined adventure with\nscience, studying reptiles and amphibians in the\nsurrounding rainforest. A photographic record\nwas made, including shots of the world's largest\nfrog as well as deadly snakes and crocodiles.\nThe canoeing proved exciting, both\nphysically and politically. As the river wound\nthrough the rainforest they encountered rapids\nthat threw them and their equipment into the\nwater and they were mistaken for a group of\nmercenaries by one of the villagers.\nThe talk will take place in the Clore Lecture\nTheatre (Mathematics) at 6pm and is free for\nmembers, \u00a31 for non-members, or \u00a32.50 for the\nlecture and membership (available on the door).\nFor further details contact David Edwards,\nChairman, Management III, or see us in\nSouthside Upper Lounge at l pm on Tuesdays.\nstorm. We forced down a cooked breakfast before\nmaking the token effort of going to the beach.\nWe then left for the sprawling metropolis,\nleaving broken hearted maidens behind.\nSo we arrived back older, but no wiser,\nhowever the weekend will go down in folklore,\nhave no doubt about that...\n(Anyone interested in competing at the\nStudent Championship should contact James\nMayhew via the Mech Eng pigeonholes.)\nww tm Loads of your favour tie tunes with Jamie from\nthe Firkin in the\nUnion Bar...\nSTARTS 8.30pm Each week!!\n\n"

With rolling\nguitars on 'Former Lover', Sarah Cracknell's usually anodyne voice takes on the maturer\nEnglish Rose of Marianne Faithful to surprising\neffect. While the more notable strings on\n'Western Wind' imbue the autumnal\nmelancholic hue of Nick Drake. It gently blows\nfrom the crevices of the psyche and reaffirms\nthat feeling blue can be therapeutic too. But\nthey're not all so low key, or eau-de-vie. The\nmetaphysical grasp of 'Hug My Soul' is brighter\nin its outlook. It twirls around sunny streets with\ncarefree insouciance; definite single material.\nSaint Etienne are certainly conceptual\nauteurs, intelligently able to grasp and jettison\nour emotional woes with these kitsch pastiches,\nbut this is not a concept album. Though the\nindividual tracks shine, and some of the motifs\nhave continuity, the overall coherence is\ndisappointing. Still their careful smudging of\naccepted style boundaries is commendable.

The\ntrappings of a show stand behind as the\nPumpkins enter. Large curved reflectors and a lighting kit capable of landing a full house.\nGently into action. 'Soma' like a coma, except\nyou get woken up half way through by the knee\njerk of exploding guitars. Suddenly it's daylight\ninside as four banks of spots fire into the already\nswaying crowd. The whole of the floor is on the\nmove. This is going to be the night we regain\nour souls and see a birth-right accepted. Away\nTrue, Deal, Malkmus, we are understanding\nwithout knowing. This is a technicolor dream\npainted experience, the tautest album of the last\nyear is bursting out in blistering volume\neverywhere, speeded up, cracked open, over us.\nWe watch as one by one they fall. Hummer,\nDisarm, I am one, Mayonnaise, Rocket, Quiet,\nGeeks here today will be gone tomorrow. Forget\nyour grandchildren, you'll be able to boast about\nthis one to your Grandparents.\nEven when Billy goes into stasis, we can only\nclap helpless as his posed axe finally falls and\nthe piper restarts his dance. \"Somewhere over\nthe Rainbow\" there might be a crock of gold but\nfool that I am I 'll stay here with a handful of\nsilver. We all die, foreheads scared deeper than\nyou think. Finally the guitar goes too, and for\nonce it's not extravagant. Its role in our lives is\nover. Billy wades into the drum kit; there's blood\non his head, he smears it onto his hands. He\nloves us you know. Tintin\nSo finally we get some\nsubjectivity in the single\nreviews, Tintin has his good\nand his ugly. This is the good\nand what a strange list it is.\nSubmarine are strangely\nreminiscent of Kristin Hersh, in title at least.\n'Lips and Fingers' really only just squeaks into\nthe upper column thanks to the two cover\nversions therein; Ultra Vivid Scene's 'Lynn\nMaire' and the smashing 'Tugboat' of Galaxie\n500. The latter containing those excellent lines\n\"I don't wanna vote for your president, I just\nwanna be your tugboat captain\". The Smashing\nPumpkins are breaking out all over this page.\nMr Happy merely says that 'Disarm' \"sounds\nlike a typical Smashing Pumpkins song\". I assume he means it's brilliant.\nVik, never one to ignore the possibilities of\npunish humour tackles Headswim's 'Moments\nof Union' ep. \"Throw into the cauldron a ladle\nfull of vehement power chords, a smattering of\nkeyboard touches and some deceptively\nhum mable tunes...let them boil over and you're\nleft with a unique concoction that'll make your\nhead...erm...swim! Delicious\" Equally evocative\nis 'Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe' from the thin\nline Whale. \" A chaotic pop trawl through\nprimal soup, this sounds like an art ic gale...hotly\ntipped for the future.\" (Camille) Therapy are\ncurrently flooding the market by releasing as\nmany things as possible.

This is the\nperfect pop song.\" (Freddy) And Owain despairs\nof the space given to review The Red House\nPainter's 'Shock Me' - \" A beautiful lonely\njoke\" is all he is allowed...\nSadly then we head down\nsouth to the ugly of the week's releases. While the sentiments\nbehind PWEI's release of 'Ich\nBien Ein Auslander' may well\nbe noble but as music it is\ngoing nowhere backwards, small wonder RCA dropped them. 8 Storey Window plug into the\nNirvana socket with 7 Will' and don't break out\nof their mould. Not worth the stubble on Kurt's chin. I suppose it can only get worse, and it\ndoes.

His popularity stems from his\nty pi fi cations of the political activist common to\nall University Student Unions', except perhaps\nthis one! As a regular writer in NME, Alan has\nbuilt up a dedicated crossover following with his\ncomedy column called 'The Truth'. This column\nhas established as a favourite with music\naudiences at outdoor British rock festivals. His\n1993 Edinburgh Festival Show 'Living on the\nEdge', enjoyed a sellout three week run.\nIn the UK, this character comedian has been\nbusy spreading sedition on the nations TV screens with appearances on various top variety\nshows including Viva Cabaret!, Packing Them\nIn, and Raw Soup.

    "content": "Sabbatical Election Manifestoes\nDeputy President (Finance & Services): Tim Brown Proposed by: JK Fouzder\nAs a famous comic said, unions are\nlike onions; both make you cry after\nten minutes. The Union's finances\naren't desperately interesting; I don't believe that anyone can make\nthem so. I intend to make this\nparticular aspect of the Union run a lot smoother than it has done, so\nthat everyone can worry about more\nimportant things.\nClubs and societies have individual financial identities. I would give\nthe people who know best, ie. chair-people and treasurers, as much of a say as possible in how they're run.\nA major problem I would like to\nsolve is the Union's financial relationship with Constituent College\nUnions (City & Guilds, Mines and\nRCSU), which are responsible for\ndepartmental societies. Whether\nthey wish to devolve financially\nfrom the Union and get funding\ndirect from College or remain with\nthe current (or a revised) financial\nstructure, I'd back them unequivocally. CCUs, just like St Mary's, are able to look after themselves\nand should be allowed to do so.\nThe Union Finance Committee,\nwhich manages Union money,\nshould comprise of sub-committees,\nwhich would contain everyone\ninterested in particular decisions (eg\nI'd agree society matters with\nappropriate representatives) and\nwhich would report to the full UFC.\nI feel my job would be to agree\npolicy with everyone involved in\nUnion finances and to help and\nadvise anyone who has to implement that policy to do so. If the\nUnion is to move its account away\nfrom NatWest, due to excessive\nbank charges, then I'd negotiate the\nbest deal possible.\nMy own Union 'record', which\nincludes one year as a society\ntreasurer followed by two as junior\ntreasurer to all the political, religious and miscellaneous societies,\nshould make me the best candidate\nfor this job (yes, folks, we're on our\nway to Cliche City).\nDeputy President (Finance & Services): Dan Look Proposed by: Greg lies\nI am a third year geologist and, in\nthe past three years I have been an\nactive member of ICRadio\nincluding regularly doing the disco\nat Southside bar on Friday nights.\nAt present I am the Honorary Junior\nTreasurer for the Publications\nBoard which has allowed me a baptism into the mysterious world\nthat is union finance.\nA question often asked to\ncandidates by fellow students is\n\"Why do you want to do that ????\",\noften with the insertion of one or\nmore expletives mid-sentence. The\nsad truth of the matter is that union\nfinances genuinely interest me (I 've\ntried to deny it to myself, but to no\navail!)\nAside from that I see this\nposition in two ways; Firstly as a chance to make a positive difference\nin the running of the union and\nsecondly as a personal challenge to\nmyself.\nIf I am elected the most\nimportant thing that I would try to\nensure is an increase in openness by\nthe union. I personally find it\nfrightening that this year the union\nreceived a grant just short of 1/2\nmillion pounds, yet how many of us\nknow how it was actually spent?\nThe other major problem I see\nwith the union at present is the\napathy of many of its members. I do\nnot propose any miracle cure for\nthis, but I would try to use my\nposition as a member of the ICU\nexec, to improve this situation to\nthe best of my ability. I realise that\nin order to get more people\ninvolved with the union it may be\nnecessary to change it so as to\naccommodate more of the student's needs as well as promoting its\ncurrent services better.\nUnfortunately I do not have the\nspace to expand on these points and\nother issues, however, I am\n(cut at the 300th word)\nAll Posts: New Election\nEvery year, people at IC vote, not\nbecause they really want to vote for\na particular sabbatical candidate,\nbut because they feel they really\nought to be voting for someone.\nThey also assume (for some\nstupid reason) that, just because a candidate wants to stand, it means\nthey'd be good at the job. (This, of\ncourse, isn't true; for any sabbatical\npost you must have the right\nqualifications and experience, just\nlike for any job - it's not enough\njust to be a 'nice person').\nDon't let this be you!\nThe reason the elections are held at\nthis time is because, if no one is\nvoted in (i.e. only crap people have\nstood), then there is still plenty of\ntime to hold another election in the\nthird term. A second election his\nhas been the case with certain posts\nfor the last five years. It is as easy\nas that.\nThe result is that often different\npeople will stand who were unsure,\nfor one reason or another, of standing the first time around. They can\nbe just as good, and are often better.\nExercise your right to vote for\nNew Election and in doing so force\nthe candidates to take your vote\nseriously. Make them convince you\nthey are worthy and in doing so you\nwill be ensuring the high quality of\nthe winner.\nIf the candidate has made you\nwant to vote for them - do.\nIf not, vote\nNEW\nELECTION\n(it's your vote -don't use it just for the sake of it) "

    "content": "Sabbatical Election Manifestoes\nPresident: Kamran Bashir Proposed by: Naresh Mistry\nSay yes to Kamran Bashir on\nelection day.\nWhy?\n* Student Representative CouncilThe way forward. As widely\nregarded, this policy is long\noverdue and has received a great\ndeal of attention from all interests in\nthe college. I believe this is a crucial issue and will ensure collaboration from all parties in carrying\nthis policy through.\n* Preservation of St Mary's as a distinct yet unique institution\nwithin the auspices of the college -It is of paramount importance that\nSt Mary's students feel that they\nbelong to the college yet their individuality should not be infringed. I As president I believe that it would\nbe my job to run the Union smoothly\nand efficiently. I have therefore\ndrawn up a set of ten promises I have discussed with people whose\nco-operation is necessary for these\nto be put into practice.\n1. The Government will bring in\nstudent reforms. I believe students\nshould be kept informed about its\nprogress and effect. I will not only\nkeep you informed, but ensure\nfunding secured for all Union\nactivities.\n2. There are plans to expand\nHeathrow in the near future,\nmeaning the loss to IC of Harlington\nsports ground. I will start ne got iI am a final year mathematician and\nI'm standing for President simply\nbecause I want to do the job and\nthink I would do it well. I'm afraid I must admit to having been heavily\ninvolved with the Union for a while\nnow. I'm not going to insult your\nintelligence with unrealistic\npromises (eg cheaper beer).\nHowever here are some of the\nthings I would like to sort out if you\nelect me.\nThe union doesn't communicate\nat all well. I would do my best to\nimprove this, for example, by\nresurrecting the \"Reaching Out\"\nfind offensive the current proposals\nto open Wilson House to all college\nstudents because this would be of\ngreat inconvenience to current\nresidents as they have a more rigorous academic program to cope with.\n* Making UL U work for us -Integration not segregation. I am of\nthe opinion that some of the finest\nevents in London are held in\nImperial College. It is important to\nmarket these events in a more\neffective manner making events at\nImperial more accessible to\nUniversity of London students, thus\nfurther enriching our environment.\nBackground\nI bring with me a breadth of experience having previously:\nat ions now to protect Harlington.\n3. At present ICU/Constituent\nCollege relations are polarised,\nmainly due to a lack of com mu nica tion. I will introduce a memo of\nunderstanding between the four\ncolleges and ICU setting out areas\nof responsibility and interests of each\nside so that all can work together.\n4. AUG M will be held once a term\nto ratify the decisions taken by a new representative council.\n5. I will improve postgraduate\nworking facilities.\n6. The Union pays 40p to NatWest\nfor each cheque cashed. I believe\nICU should be brought into line\nwith other student unions and insist\nstalls that were so effective at the\nend of last year. Also I would like\nto investigate further a student\nemployment bureau as was\npromised a while ago. Three\nhundred words isn't much, so\nplease read my fliers for more\ninformation. Here's Chris:\nIt is uncommon for a proposer to\nmake election promises, but I will\npromise that Paul is right for the job\nof I.C. Union President.\nWhen I finished as President last\nyear, I made up my mind not to get\ninvolved in Union politics and I haven't until now. I feel Paul's* been elected treasurer and\nchairperson of the parachute club.\n* actively participated in the\ndecision making in the recreational\nclubs committee.\n* successfully completed two\nacademic sessions\n* resided in intercollegiate hall thus\nexperiencing many social venues\nattached to the University of\nLondon.\n* run a club night in various venues\naround London.\nFinally\nI will ensure that you receive\nimpressive representation which is\neffective and strong.\nRemember. If anyone can Kamran\ncan, Cheers.\non an account with no bank charges.\n7. It is difficult for any group other\nthan Ents to arrange an event. I will\nset up a complementary board to\nadvise and help organise any\nstudent event.\n8. The Union paid for the refurbishment of the Sports Centre, but\nthe Sports Centre is run by College,\nforcing clubs and societies to pay\nlarge amounts for its use. I believe\nthe sports centre should benefit IC\nstudents, not sub sid is e Kensington\nresidents.\n9. I will promote a college-wide\nsecond hand book shop.\n10. As president I will be fully\naccountable.\ncommitment to the tasks he undertakes is exactly what the Union, as a whole, needs. This belief has led me\nto give as much support to his\ncampaign as 1 can.\nI have known Paul as a fellow\nExecutive member and as a friend\nand can honestly say that I have\nfound his help in difficult times, his\ndedication and his support second\nto none. I cannot say that Paul is\nperfect and will always make the\nright decision. I do know that we\nneed a Union President and that\nPaul's sense and commitment will\nmake him a damn good one.\nPresident: Lucy Chothia Proposed by: Max Sahibzada\nPresident: Paul Thomas Proposed by: Chris Davidson\nPlease Note: Dave Cohen has withdrawn as a Presidential candidate\n\n"

Not\nenough, no doubt. Well tonight is one of those\nrare occasions. The Food Fair of the Overseas\nStudents' Committee's International Nite allows\nyou to experiment, and I will attempt to describe\nsome for you of the alternative dishes available.\nThis year all the dishes have been\nappropriated from restaurants, so the quality and\nauthenticity is guaranteed!\nThere are ten different cultures represented\nfrom all corners of the world. This reflects the\nenormous diversity of peoples found in IC.\nSo, you have two vouchers, now how should\nyou use them? I recommend you go for things\nthat look totally unfamiliar to you. This is your\nchance to try something different quite safely!\nAt the Iranian stall there will be a selection of\nsnacks. So your voucher will get you a cutlet,\nsome olive salad, Pilashki (pastry stuffed with\nmince meat), Coocoo (vegetable cake) and\nDolmeh (stuffed vine leaves). Personally, I cannot wait for the Pilashki.\nMore snacks are to be found with the\nPakistanis. You will find some shish kebabs\n(spicy mince meat cooked over hot coals),\nsamos as( savoury stuffed pastries), a loo tiki\n(potato cutlet) some salad and pitta bread.\nEnough variety here to suit anyone's palate.\nThe Sri Lankans bring us Egg Gothamba.\nThe best description I can give of it is that it is\npancake-like, with an egg cooked in the middle.\nIt really is gorgeous. My portrayal gives it no\njustice. The Seeni Sambol that goes with it is a chutney and is normally very spicy. Let us hope\nthat it has been made more palatable for us!\nThey tried hard, but the Japanese just could\nnot get hold of any sushi. Instead they tempt us\nwith grilled chicken, which has undergone\nrigorous Japanese-style marinating, with rice.\nFor noodles try the Singaporean stall. Kway\nTeow Goreng is being served with a curry.\nThese are wide white noodles, and all the\nSingaporeans I have talked to have begun to\ndrool when I mentioned to them that it will be\nserved!\nCoconut rice, with extras, comes from the\nMalaysians. Personally I prefer it without the\nextras.\nNow, dessert has not been forgotten. After\nall, it is my favourite part of the meal! The AfroCaribbeans have Briwats, Kaab El Gazel, Sfof\nSweet and Kwilate to end our meal with. Sorry I do not know what they are, just ask them when\nyou're there - they will be happy to tell you. If\nyou do not have a sweet tooth, the French are\nserving La Grande Bouchee. This is a marvellous selection of cheeses (yes Brie is\nthere) served with bread.\nAfter writing this I just wish I could try out\nevery stall there will be at the Fair, and I have\nnot even mentioned everything that will be\navailable tonight. So remember don't be shy in\ntrying out new foods, and always ask the people\nat the stall about the food - they will gladly tell\nyou about it. And do try out new foods. It\ndoesn't hurt! But above all, enjoy yourself!\nThe Food Fair runs from 6pm to 7.30pm tonight\nin the Main Dining Hall in the Sherfield\nBuilding.

I have been Chairman and\nTreasurer of the Ski Club and\nSecond Team Captain for the\nBadminton Club. I feel that this has\ngiven me a good insight into the\nrunning of the Union with respect to\nthe clubs and societies.\nI would like to see a major\nimprovement in the sports facilities\nin this College, I think with a new\nsports hall it would be possible for\nour teams to return to the top of the\nU AU championships. In addition to\nthe obvious advantages for the\nsports clubs an improvement in the\namount of sports facilities would\nallow the other non-sporting clubs\nand societies more space to put on\ntheir events leading to bigger and\nbetter shows and carnivals.\nI believe that I could make a very good job of the Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies) and\nthe running of this side of the\nUnion.

Well, it definitely is\nfor me since I want to be part of it.\nIt is what gives our academic life\nand all this horrible work a different\nflare. You must have been involved\nin some society or club, sport,\nevents or overseas, and have\nenjoyed. The driving force behind\nall that is the Union.\nPersonally, I would like to be\ninvolved with these responsibilities\nbecause I would like, and think am\nin a position, to mediate for Clubs\nand Societies in such way so that\nthey function sensibly and after all\noffer their members a good time.\nOne my objectives, if elected,\nwould be to advise Clubs and\nSocieties on how to make their\nactivities better known, how to\nattract all the people who would\nlike to get involved but have not\nrealised that such opportunities are\naround. Finally, I would like to help\nSocieties coexist in peace, which is\nusually an issue for Overseas\nSocieties.\nWhy am I the best suited\ncandidate?\nI was the Yacht Club's treasurer\nthis year from which I have gained\nimmense experience of sports\nactivities for the students and how\nto organise events. In my first year,\nI was involved with the Greek\nSociety which offered me insight on\nOverseas Societies and how not\nonly help foreign students adjust to\ntheir new environment but also\nexpose their culture to the rest of\nthe college.\nI am full of new views and I am\nan outsider to the Union and how it\nworks since I have not been\ninvolved with it before. Fresh ideas\nwith respect for established\npractices and listening to people's needs would be my policy.\nFor all this, I think I am the best....\n(cut at the 300th word)\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies): Ian Parish Proposed by: Kate Dalton\nI am proposing Ian Parish for the\npost of Deputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties) because I believe he will\nmake an excellent sabbatical. He\nwas Aerosoc chairman 92-93, City\n& Guilds Departmental Society\nOfficer 93-94 and has been Assistant Station Manager at I.C. Radio\nbetween 92 and 94. On top of this\nhe has been the Imperial College\nrepresentative to the Royal Aeronautical Society for the last two\nyears. He is a very approachable\ncharacter with a wicked sense of\nhumour, I know he will do a first\nrate job of representing and coordinating your Clubs and Societies.\nVote for Ian.\nKate Dalton\nIf elected I have two main\npriorities. The first is to secure\nmore funding for Clubs and\nSocieties by sponsorship. I will\napproach this in the summer,\nconcentrating on both local and\nnation-wide businesses.\nThe second is to increase the\nservices available to Clubs and\nSocieties. I will clarify the Union's position with College, a situation\nwhich is confused at the moment. I increase the amount of room-time\nfor each Club and Society\naccording to their real needs. I will\nstreamline the bureaucracy involved\nwith Clubs and Societies. I will also\nimprove and increase the local\nsporting facilities available,\nincluding campaigning for a new\nlocal sports hall for the use of\nstudents.\nBeing on the Guilds exec, I understand how the decisions made\nby ICU affect Clubs and Societies. I will be the Clubs and Societies\nunion officer, NOT a union officer\nwho just happens to be involved\nwith the Clubs and Societies.\nI believe that my involvement in\nCCUs and I.C. Radio had given me\nthe training to fulfil the D.P. job\ndescription right from the start of\nmy term of office.\n\n"

The Twentieth\nCentury may have its Einstein tea cosies but\nGalileo was a hunted figure, threatened by the\ntorture instruments of the Inquisition and finally\ndestroyed by religion. Of course it's not as\npolished as that, truth rarely is. Yet Bertolt\nBrecht's play manages to avoid getting too dug\ninto the details as well as it accounts for the\nbasic historiography of the events. For 'The Life\nof Galileo' is a broader play, encompassing the\nwhole of Science's impact on its participants and\nsociety in general.\nRichard Griffiths is not perhaps the obvious\nchoice for the lead role. His sheer physical bulk\nmakes him appear clumsy in the relatively\ndynamic first half. Which doesn't sit easily with\nthe attitude that one would expect from the\nsuave, arrogant scientist. Only after the interval\nwhen the crises occur do points begin to be\nsharpened.\nThe velvet gloves which had previously\nshook hands, become more dogmatic as the red\nvested Cardinals of the Church icily remind\nGalileo of the burning fires for heretics. The\ndetached malice of Alfred Burke's Chief\nInquisitor stalks best in these scenes. Edward de\nSouza, as the Pope, also holds the reigns of\npower with a force of being. Such are the goads\nGalileo is warned not to kick against. The idea\nthat the earth is not the centre of the universe\n111 1 lili l sill ij Wicked, Yaar!\nFor me, the star of the show is Bhaskar, the\nGhul, a modern day genie who has the power to\ngrant wishes by a medallion. Malik Mir takes\npossession of it and instantly the Ghul provides\nhim with a new red cricket bag. Cricket is one\nof the main themes of this musical, with\nBhangramuffins Hunters and Jax Williams\nrapping the chorus in Classical Greek style to the\nrhythm of this Bhangrabeat.\nThree thugs, Gazza, Gora and Gori, beat up\nMalik and eventually take possession of his\ngolden medallion. But thugs being what they\nare, they fail to take proper advantage and end\nup with a load of electronic equipment and a pair of Nikes. In the end Gazza accidentally\nkills Malik because of one of the incidental but\nredundant love interests in the plot and the play\nends with that sad fact resonating around our\nheads, attempting to highlight injustice.\nI didn't feel very deeply touched by Malik's plight but the presentation of the material is\nimpressive and the music exciting.\nAdrian Thurston\n'Wicked Yaar!' plays at the Cottesloe Theatre\nfrom March 8th. Phone 071 633 0880for details.\nwas only a worthy mathematical hypothesis,\nmore physical interpretations promised to be\ndeadly. So Galileo redirects his time to the study\nof floating ice and sloping planes. Things are\nquiet for a time in Florence.\nBut then a new Pope who is favourable to\nGalileo is crowned and he finally publishes his\nDialogue concerning the Two Chief Systems of\nthe World in 1632. The doleful voice of the\nInquisition booms out; Galileo begins his\ndownward spiral. As he is publicly forced to\nrecant, his followers play out the pivotal scene.\nFirst joyful in the hope that Galileo will uphold\nscientific truth, they are eclipsed as recantations\nflow. It is night, their sun has fallen from the sky.\nGalileo ends up trying to live with his\nbetrayal of truth. His eyes have been ruined by\nyears of gazing through his telescope, his life\nAndromache\nThis play was first drama tis ed by Euripides in\n420 BC, and this new translation is based on\nJean Racine's version of 1667.\nThe plot is essentially one in which\neverybody loves someone and is in turn loved by\nsomeone else to whom they are indifferent or\nhostile. The men are torn between their hearts'\ndesires, and their responsibilities towards the\nEmpire. Orestes loves Hermione who is\ndisinterested in him. Hermione loves Pyrrhus\nwhose hand is sworn to her in political marriage\nanyway. Pyrrhus is infatuated with Andromache\nwho loathes him for killing her husband in battle\nduring the sacking of Troy. Andromache's one\ninterest is to protect her son Astyanax, sole\nsurviving prince of Troy. She is not interested in\nthe throne for her little boy, only in saving his life.\nNow Pyrrhus should kill Astyanax, who is a threat to the Greek Empire but Pyrrhus is loathe\nto do so, as the threat over the child's life is his\nonly hold over Andromache. Orestes arrives in\nEpirus with orders to persuade Pyrrhus to kill\nthe boy. Orestes is also interested in wooing\nHermione. Should he succeed in his charge, then\nPyrrhus will be unable to marry Andromache,\nruined by a clash of science and dogma. Yet it is\nnot to say that science has been robbed, because\nBrecht is not simply condemning the Church. It\nis clear that as the denial of science withers\nGalileo so the 'truth' of science can destroy\nwhole communities. The Church was fighting\nfor the religious certainty of the common man. It\nrequires both parties to carefully consider the\nbasis of their chosen knowledge. As the death of\nreligion has been exaggerated so the life of\nscience could prove to be less significant than\nwe would like to admit.\nTintin\n'The Life of Galileo' plays at the Almeida\nTheatre, Almeida St, Nl. Box Office 071 359 4404\nTubes: Angel or Islington and Highbury.\nRuns until 31st March, Mon-Sat 8pm, tickets \u00a36.50-115.50\nand marry Hermione himself!\nThis sort of thing is known as a Greek\nTragedy and it was certainly all Greek to me.\nThe characters were quite regal, with imperial\npassions and dilemmas. Frankly, neither the\nactors nor the venue were quite up to it.\nThe Camden Studio Theatre is a cellar under\na book shop in Chalk Farm Road. One is\nreminded that the venue is between Chalk Farm\nand Camden Town when the whole 'theatre'\nvibrates as the underground trains go by.\nI would not recommend this production to\nmost students outside the Imperial College\n'Classics Faculty'. Call me a Philistine, but if it\ntook 2,000 years before Racine decided to do a remake, perhaps Jon Harris should have waited a little longer to direct the new translation.\nMichael Factor\nAndromache' runs until 12th March at Camden\nStudio Theatre, 37 Chalk Farm Road.

The Council also agreed that\ncollege unions will subscribe to\nUL U on the same basis.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies\nFootball, Football And Even More Football\nIC l sts4 St Georges 2\nLast Saturday saw IC l sts facing St Georges in a major bottom of the league relegation battle.\nImperial were in low spirits following the\nnarrow defeat the week before at the hands of\nUCL. Also they were missing several of their\nkey players, so it was a patchwork quilt of a side\nmade up from most of the second team,\nincluding the perennial second team captain Rax\nMuthoo. The game started off with IC easily\ntaking control, despite some thug-like tackles\nfrom the opposition, who appeared to be the\nresult of inbreeding between neanderthal men!\nIC's quality shone through and Alex de\nStefano was delighted to score his first goal of\nthe season following good work from Rax and\nAnthony Clerc. Mark Nally was scarcely\nthreatened in goal due to solid defending and\npositional play from Matteo Farina and Andy\nFenton. Rickie Dixon was in defence as well.\nBen Willis who should have been in defence\nwas bent (?) on thrusting forward (!) to increase\nImperial's lead. However, he th rusted too hard\nfor Christine de Wolf's liking, and she booked\nhim, claiming she should have sent him off!\nMike Jarvis then increased the goal margin,\nbefore IC felt generous and allowed Georges to\ntoe-punt the ball in the right direction.\nDebut-boy Anthony Clerc netted IC's third,\nand Ben Willis coolly slotted another penalty.\nBill Al-Khatib could have scored several, but\nGeorges defence were so quick they made him\nlook slower than Ian Finnerty! Georges did\nmanage another goal, but just to make sure IC\nwon, Christine the Ref gave George an indirect\nfree kick in the box, following Matteo picking\nthe ball up and running twenty yards with it.\nSuch generosity!\nIC 1 -14 Alpine l sts Due to the arctic weather conditions, our\nopposition wisely did not show up. After 30\nminutes of waiting we accepted the challenge of\na friendly from another team whose opposition\nalso did not show up. The Alpine l sts were a more experienced male team and it showed.\nDespite playing 13-a side, having a former\nImperial 1st team keeper (thanks for playing,\nTim) the score was 0-7 at half time. Goals\nincluded an amazing header from a corner and a European-style be lter from near the centre circle.\nA switch around at half time meant that Mr\nHullsent was sent home, replaced outfield by Mr\nIan 'FHR' Arden. He completely failed to mark\nAlpine's goalie-turned-striker who scored with\nan absolutely fabulous bicycle kick. However,\nMr Archer did compensate by scoring our only\ngoal of the match (fluke or wot?).\nEven though they wouldn't shake hands with\nus afterwards because we were 'girls', our\ncongratulations go to the Alpine Under 14s who\ncould easily take on the IC 3rds( and definitely\nthe 2nds). IC II1 - UCH 3 St. Mary's1 IC II7\nThe end of season for the Imperial College 2nd XI is proving to be an exciting roller-coaster.\nHaving beaten Kings College Hospital, IC fell\nto University College Hospital at Harlington\nwith Mohammed Al-Said scoring the only goal\nfor the Seconds. Thus, when Imperial travelled\nto play St. Mary's, they had to win to keep the\nhopes of staying in Division One alive. Indeed\nIC obtained an emphatic victory, both in style\nand in content.\nBillal Al-Khatib provided a number of\ncritical assists and scored a goal himself, but it\nwas Nadarajah who hit top form on the day. He\nscored four times; now with beautifully flight ed lob, now with a sweet tap-in, always finishing\nwith style.\nThe medics also found it difficult to contain\nAbs Said and Ritch Craig in midfield, who\nplayed with determination and authority despite\ntheir own deteriorating physical conditions.\nAnthony Clerc placed his name on the score\nsheet with an excellent finish and could have\nhad more. However, it was full-back Roddy\nHerris, playing with passion and skill, who\nscored the finest goal. He won the ball deep in\nhis own half, played a one-two in the middle,\nheld off a strong challenge and finished with\ncomposure.\nIC 2nds travel to London Colney tomorrow\nto play the unbeaten University College 2nds, with a view to pulling off a major upset.\nIC Radio Programme Schedule\nDAY\nTIME\n8-9\n9-10\n10-11\n11-12\n12-1\n1-2\n2-3\n3-4\n4-5\n5-6\n7-8\n8-9\n9-10\n10-11\nFRI\n4th SAT SUN MON TUE WED\n5th6 th7 th8 th9 th THUR\n10th BREAKFAST |\nWITH THE\nPOSSE\nBREAKFAST WITH THE POSSE\nMUSIC\nJAM\nKICK UP\nTHE ARTS1\nJUKEBOX\nANDY'S SHOW\nMATT\nAROUND\nMIDDAY\nTOP\n40\nALBUM\nCHART\nWITH\n' THE\nLOFT\nUK\nTOP\n40\nALEXS\nBIT\nMUSIC JAM MUSIC\nJAM\nBRYAN\nDAN THE\nMAN'S LUNCHBOX\nWED'DAYI\nWEEK\nAL'S GROOVE\nSHOW\nMUSIC\nJAM\nJUKE BOX\nnra q n IMPOSSIBLE\nELECTION\nPROGRAMME CHINA\nTIM\nBACK TO\nBASICS\nRICHARD\nSAW\n8 O 'CLOCK\nNEWS\nPIERS\nTALKS\nHAMSTER\nPATRICK\nWOOD\nCLASSICAL\nCalling All Jumpers\nIfyoujumped for WHIP on 7th November\nand still owe your sponsorship money\nThen PHASEpayASAP (by next Friday).\nCome to the RAG office any Lunchtime.\nf lie sooner you pay\nJhe sooner you get your deposits o acE' "

Light refreshment provided.\nThe 1994 Imperial College Photographic Society Exhibition opens in the on Monday and lasts until\nthe end of term. The photos are very diverse in styles, both colour and black and white and give a view of the world as seen by IC students. The Photographic Society has full darkroom facilities in the\nUnion Building and offers tuition to beginners, studio equipment, cheap films and visits to London\nexhibitions. For more details contact Andy Forbes, Mech Eng 4 or see us in Southside Lounge on\nTuesdays at 1pm. Samba By The Sea\nThe Quest For\nThe Gritstone\nThe Mountaineers weather-defiant quest for\ngrit stone took them to Stanage. After pushing\nthe van up to the base of the crags, five of the\ntwelve abandoned base camp and made (deep)\ntracks into the fog to a cave in order to beat the\ncrag rush for routes in the morning. Ice climbing\nin trainers proved too keen so eight waited\npatiently for morning in the van, the ninth\nsnored loudly and three bi vied peacefully.\nA Reconnaissance for the SPD pact was\nmade of the Hathersage area, terminating at a cafe; a snow war followed sending innocent\npeople to seek cover. We spent the entirety of\nthe wet afternoon in the Foundry climbing wall\nin Sheffield engaged in more technique and\nmuscle constructive pursuits until everyone had\nwrecked their tendons to a level of discomfort.\nThe py jama party option was abandoned for a country pub where we asked for everything on\nthe menu, played spoons with knives and\nsevered a few fingers to relieve the other pains.\nPlainly in need of a good bed for the night we\nwere offered a dry barn with beds out the back.\nSunday was deemed unfit for climbing since\nno-one could climb the rock bus shelter so after\na cafe stop we inspected the boulder park below\nStanage Edge, turned it into a snow-war zone\nand went home wet and exceedingly smelly.\nThe next trip to the Lakes will go ahead,\ndriver permitting. See the noticeboard on the\nclimbing wall (next to the JCR) to sign up.\nDrivers particularly welcome.\nSee England vs\nDenmark Free\nFancy seeing England play Denmark on\nWednesday 9th? Want to find out if Terry\nVenables knows what he's doing? It's England's first game since the debacle of the World Cup\nqualifiers, so will the new breed of England\nplayers improve on recent performances, especially against the present European Champions?\nWell, if you are willing to spend an hour or two\ncollecting outside Wembley for the Spastics\nSociety before the game, then we at Rag might\nbe able to get you in to see the match for free!\nIf you are interested in fulfilling a life-long\nambition of parachuting, or just fancy jumping\n2000ft( with a bit of nylon tied to you), then\nwe're now organising a sponsored parachute\njump in aid of Great Ormond Street hospital.\nWe're also looking for someone to be Rag\nMag Editor for next year, so if you've a suitably\ndepraved mind, please come and talk to us, or if\nyou're interested in any of the other Rag\ncommittee posts.\nFor any of these events, or if you just fancy a chat, please come and see us either at the Rag\nmeeting at 1.10pm on Friday in the Union\nLounge or in the Rag Office any lunch time.\nLast Saturday saw Southampton University host\nthe Southern Ball, at Bournemouth. This event,\nthe largest dancing competition for the South,\nwas attended by a dozen or so Universities\nincluding Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol. The\nstakes were double high: Imperial was defending\nall three Team trophies, and the Nationals are a mere fortnight away.\nA week ago, disaster struck; a team already\nlaid low by flu was hit by chicken pox and we\nlost one of our A Team. The week was spent in\nfrantic attempts to rebuild three teams. At the\nlast moment Shirli stepped in, the teams were\nreshuffled and dealt and we were ready to leave.\nThe sun was shining on the sea as we arrived\nat Bournemouth Pavilion - for once we were on\ntime, having left the Oxford teams in a service\nstation 30 minutes away. Rumours abounded\nthat a confident Cambridge side was paddling in\nthe sea. Inspection of the dance floor revealed\nthat it was rather fast (translation: like an ice-rink).\nThe afternoon events saw Paul/Zoe,\nSatin/Mansi and Bryan/Sarah take 123 in the\nPaso Doble, while the latter came second in a hard-going Tango final. Both Beginner couples\n(Sai Hong/Julianna, Navill/Laura) reached the\nCha Cha finals.\nFinally, the Team Matches. Even after the\nfinals, the results were too close - nine of IC's twelve couples had reached finals, but Oxford,\nCambridge and Bristol had almost as many.\nThe results - we did it! We retained all three\ntrophies, winning three out of the four individual\nevents. Celebrations on the coach home were not\nso much muted as silenced by exhaustion; gentle\nsnores accompanied the pundits at the back who\nwere discussing tactics for the Nationals.\nTeams\nWaltz: Bryan Crotaz & Sarah Cutmore;\nTimothy Ake & Lucy Chothia;\nTead Rezek & Jacqui Harn.\nCha Cha: Paul Skjold & Zoe Antoniou;\nTuang Liang Lim & Lye Yen Tien;\nSuttinan Chattong & Seetal Patel.\nQuickstep: Andrew Smith & Elaine Hornby;\nPeter Purdie & Sian Rowsell;\nMichael Ng & Shirli van der Vledder.\nJive: Satin Gunga & Mansi Amin;\nKenwyn James & Ruth Schuster;\nRoger de Souza & Siu Lin Goh.\nSee page 5 for details of St Mary's Rag Week\n\n"
