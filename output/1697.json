Union\nCouncil voted in favour\nof a motion to lobby the\nCollege to make additional funding available to\naffected students.\nThe Imperial Bursary\nprovides support to Home\nundergraduate students\nwith an annual household\nincome of up to \u00a360,000,\non a sliding scale. It is\navailable to students\nthroughout their degree \u2013\nnot including repeat years\n\u2013 and may be revised each\nyear.\nUniversities across the\ncountry have withheld\nsalaries from academic\nand support staff who\ntook part in the UCU\nstrike earlier this year.\nThe industrial action was\norganised in response to\nproposed changes to pen-sions, which UCU argued\nwould leave members\n\u00a310,000 worse off each\nyear.\nLast week Felix revealed Russell Group universities have withheld \u00a38\nmillion in salaries, with\nfurther deductions expected in the near future.\nImperial have withheld\njust under \u00a3280,000 from\nstaff in March and April,\nwith the number likely to\nincrease in the future.

Police\nsources said there were\nemails on Dr Anderson\u2019s\nwork computer referring\nto \u201cwork expectations not\nbeing manageable.\u201d\nDr Anderson\u2019s wife,\nDiane, with whom he had\nthree daughters, described\nher husband as someone\nwho \u201cwould always give\nthe very best to everything\nthat he did, but was\nsilently struggling.\u201d She\nsaid his commute was an\n120-mile round trip, and\nhis workload meant he\nwas unable to spend time\nwith family.\nCardiff University, who\ndescribed Dr Anderson as\n\u201can excellent teacher with\nthe rare ability to enthuse\nthe large numbers of\nstudents who attended his\nlectures,\u201d said they would\nbe reviewing the support\navailable to staff.\nThe news led a number\nof academics to refer to the\ncase of Stefan Grimm, a\nprofessor of toxicology at\nImperial College London\nwho took his own life\nin 2014. A posthumous\nemail sent by Professor\nGrimm to staff within Imperial cited the pressure\nhe was under to bring in\nmore grant money, with\nan email from his line\nmanager saying he was\n\u201cstruggling to fulfil the\nmetrics of a Professorial\npost at Imperial College\u201d,\nsince he was unable to\nbring in \u00a3200,000 per\nannum in a programme\ngrant.\nThe coroner into\nProfessor Grimm\u2019s case\ndescribed the death as\n\u201cneedless.\u201d\nImperial completed\nan internal review of\nstaff policies following\nProfessor Grimm\u2019s\ndeath, although a College\nspokesperson told Felix\nat the time that \u201cgiven the\ncomplex nature of suicide,\nit would be impossible\nto answer with certainty\nwhether any action taken\nby the College could have\nresulted in a different\noutcome.\u201d\nThe case comes amid\nincreasing concern\nover the workload of\nacademic and support\nstaff in higher education\ninstitutions. Two studies,\nreleased earlier this\nyear, highlighted what\nTimes Higher Education\ndescribed as \u201ca crisis of\noverwork and poor mental\nhealth in academia.\u201d In\none study, postgraduate\nstudents were found to\nbe more than six times\nmore likely to experience\nanxiety or depression than\nthe general population.\nIf you have been affected by anything in this\narticle, please consider\nspeaking to your personal\ntutor, senior tutor, ICU\nAdvice Centre, or the\nImperial Counselling\nService.

Serving as Felix\nEditor over the past year\nhas been an incredible\nprivilege. To say I\u2019ve\nenjoyed every minute of\nit would be untrue, but\nit has included moments\nthat have been so rewarding they outweigh any\nminor inconveniences or\nfrustrations.\nTo be coming to the\nend of this journey is bit-tersweet. But \u2013 in classic\nFelix style \u2013 this sense of\nmelancholy is tempered\nby a mood of urgency and\nslight madness. You may\nnotice that this week\u2019s\nFelix is slightly heavier\nthan usual \u2013 given it was\nthe last week, section\neditors and contributors\npulled out all the stops,\ndelivering to you a\n64-page behemoth of an\nissue, the longest issue\nwe\u2019ve put out all year. We\nsincerely hope you enjoy\nit, and have enjoyed the\nprevious 28 issues we\u2019ve\nput out since September.\nFelix has been many\nthings to me during my\ntime here at Imperial. I\nthink, like most students,\nin all honesty, my introduction to university life\nwas difficult. Moving\ninto student halls where\nyou don\u2019t know anyone;\nbecoming used to a class\nsize of over 200; suddenly\nfeeling like a very small\nminnow in an enormous\nocean \u2013 they all took\nsome getting used to.\nDuring the first couple\nof years, it was writing\nfor Felix that gave me\nsome sense of regularity\n\u2013 writing mainly for the\nArts section, I would take\na break from lectures, and\nhead out to exhibitions all\nover this beautiful city.\nFelix gave me an escape.\nIt wasn\u2019t until my\nthird year that I actually\ngot involved with the\neditorial team, joining\nas an Arts Editor. It\nwas a hugely exciting\ntime for me \u2013 I can still\nremember meeting with\nthe then-Editor Philippa\nfor the first time, as she\ntried to put the freshers\u2019\nissue together without\na working office. I also\nrecall meeting with my\nfellow Arts Editor, Kamil,\nbefore term started, to talk\nabout all our plans for the\nyear; we went to the Tate\nBritain\u2019s exhibition of the\nlate works of JMWTurner,\nand I promptly had a nosebleed \u2013 perhaps from the\nsheer intensity of Turner\u2019s\ncolours. Over that year\nKamil and I would build\nup relationships with\nLondon galleries and\ntheatres, pumping out an\ninsane amount of content.\nIt\u2019s a time I remember\nincredibly fondly, and\nthe Arts section still\nholds a special place\nin my heart. The Felix\nOffice became a refuge\nfor me \u2013 I would look\nforward each Wednesday\nto spending my afternoons there, chatting with\nother editors, and putting\ntogether pages. Felix gave\nme a home.\nI went into this year\nthinking I was prepared\nfor anything that could\nbe thrown at me. With\nfive years of experience,\nI thought I had a good\ngrip on what the job\nwould entail. But I soon\ncame to realise that, no\nmatter how much time I\u2019d\nspent with Felix, nothing\ncould have prepared me\nfor the weekly rush to\nget the paper out. What\ncompletely blindsided\nme, however, wasn\u2019t the\nwork or the writing: it was\nthe people. We started\nthe year with very few\npeople remaining, and\nrapidly had to rebuild\nthe editorial team. It was\nan experiment \u2013 I didn\u2019t\nknow whether or not\neverything would work\nout. But it did. The new\nfriendships I have made\nthis year, and the previous\nones that have deepened,\nhave been the most\nvaluable part of the whole\nexperience. I know, now,\nthat after the last issue has\ngone to print, and I have\nleft this university, what I\nwill remember most isn\u2019t\nthe articles we published,\nor the change we helped\nenact, but the people I\nhave met, and the experiences we have all had\ntogether. Words cannot\nexpress how grateful I\nam to everyone who has\ncontributed to creating the\npaper this year. Felix has,\nnow, given me a family.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

Overall, out of those in relationships,\n26.4% were in a long distance relationship\n\u2013 what that individual considered as \u2018long\ndistance\u2019was up to them.\nThe majority of these relationships were\n100-400km, a distance that made up 29.4% of\nLDRs. As you may expect from a student body\nwith a significant number of internationals,\n27.6% of LDRs had a distance of over 3000km.\nOverall, most respondants who had been in\na long distance relationship said the distance\nhad made them weaker as a couple. This was\nmost significant at the 100-400km range,\nwhich, from London, would cover most places\nwithin England and Wales.\nInterestingly, there was a positive correlation between distance and strength of relationship \u2013 the\nfurther away the individuals were away from each other, the more likely the respondant was to say\ntheir relationship had been strengthened. Those who had a distance of >3000km \u2013 which would\nessentially exclude much of Europe \u2013 were the most likely to say their relationship had been made\nstronger thanks to distance.\nAP\nP\nS\nR\nE\nL\nA\nT\nI\nO\nNSHIPS\nCHEAT\nI\nN\nG\nS\nA\nT\nI\nS\nFACTION\nThe number of respondents who\ncheated on their partner, or were\ncheated on by their partner, were\nroughly similar: 25.6% of respondents\nhadbeencheatedonatleastonce,while\n25.9% had cheated on their partner at\nleast once. 10.5% of respondents had cheated on their\npartners more than once.\nBut what constitutes cheating, exactly? Men and\nwomen were found to have largely similar views on what\nconstitutes cheating, although there were some slight\ndifferences. Both thought sexual contact and kissing were\nthe most likely to be cheating, although men were slightly\nmore secure in their belief it always counted as cheating.\nWomen, by contrast, were slightly more likely to count social media chat,\nthinking of other people, flirting with others, and chatting with people on\ndating apps as cheating.\nOverall:\n54.3% in relationships 45.7% flying solo\nMoving on to relationships: overall, more than half the\nrespondents were in a relationship, with 54.3% having met\ntheir match. Heterosexual people were more likely to be\nin a relationship than non-heterosexual people: 55.4% of\nheterosexualrespondentswereinarelationship,while50.8%ofnon-heterosexualrespondents\nwere in one.\nIn terms of departments, Aeronautics students were the least likely to be in a relationship,\nwith just under half the respondents being part of a couple. Materials students were the most\nlikely to be in a relationship, with 62.5% of respondents having found a match.\nOf these relationships, the majority had been going for over 6 months: 40.2% had been together for more than a year,\nwith a further 24.6% together for 6-12 months. A small minority were in the very early stages of a relationship, with 5.1% of\nthose in a relationship having got together only in the past month\nWould you always consider the following cheating?\nMen\nWomen\nIt\u2019s a university trope that\nrelationships carried over from\nsecondary school tend to break up\npretty quickly. With the Sex Survey, we\ndecided to check out whether or not\nthat was the case. Around 250 students\ncarried over a relationship from their\nsecondary school, and currently 34.8%\nof these are still going.\nLooking at how long these relationships tended to last on average,\nwe can see there is a steady decline over time, but this decline is at\nits sharpest over two time periods: within the first few months of\nuniversity, and the period approaching the year anniversary.\nWhile at first glance it doesn\u2019t seem to conform with the idea\nstudents break up as soon as freshers\u2019 hits, we can see that after the\none month mark the number of relationships begins to drop more\ndramatically. It could be this is because of post-freshers\u2019 regret, or\nguilt at what they might have gotten up to at the mingle\u2026\nDating apps are now ubiquitous\nin modern society, but which ones\nreign supreme? At Imperial, Tinder\nis king, with 22% of those using\ndating apps making use of Tinder.\nThe next most popular was Bumble,\nwhere in straight matchings the\nwoman is the one who makes first\ncontact, with 16% of the market share. Plenty o\u2019Fish\nand OK Cupid were the next most popular, while\nGrindr, which arguably first started the dating app\ntrend, only has 6% of the share.\nThose looking for love on the apps might have to\nlook out, however. 49% of those using apps did so for\neasy or convenient sex, with a further 7% looking for\n\u2018lewd conversations\u2019. 10% of users were looking for\nfriends, while only 32% of those using the apps were\nlooking for a real relationship.\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1697\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nGod save the Childqueen\nLA psychedelic-soul artist Kadhja Bonet returns with Childqueen, the follow-up to her breakthrough LP The\nVisitor, displaying her instrumental skills and syrupy vocals.\nT\nhere is a double\npleasure in\ndiscovering the\nmusic of LA\npsychedelic-soul artist\nKadhja Bonet. There is,\nfirst of all, the joy to be\nfound in the music: warm\nand inviting, completely\ndrenched in a sticky sense\nof pleasant nostalgia, the\nsongs seem to have been\nbeamed to us directly\nfrom the 1970s. This sense\nof timelessness seems to\nplace Bonet\u2019s work among\nthe legion of record store\noddities, which gathered\ndust in crates before being\nrecognised as brilliant\nworks \u2013 musicians like\nLinda Perhacs and Kim\nJung Mi spring to mind,\nnot due to sonic simi-larities, but more in the\nsense we are listening to\nsomething that was once\nlost, now found.\nThe second pleasure,\ntherefore, is finding\nthat \u2013 despite her \u201870s\nstylings \u2013 Bonet is very\nmuch a modern artist,\nwho only put out her\ndebut album a couple of\nyears ago. Her 2016 LP,\nentitled The Visitor, was\na well-curated collection\nof beautiful songs, with a\nclearly-defined sound \u2013 a\ncurious mixture of soul,\npsychedelia, and funk.\nThe name of the album\nwas appropriate: Bonet\nseems in many ways like\nsome kind of visitation,\nsomeone plucked from\nanother time and space,\nonly touching down for a\nbrief instance.\n\u201cBonet seems\nin many ways\nlike some kind\nof visitation\nfrom another\ntime and\nspace\u201d\nWith Childqueen, her\nfollow-up, Bonet continues to plunder from a\nvast array of sources, but\ndevelops her confidence,\ncreating a sound that is excitingly entirely her own.\nThe first few minutes of\nChildqueen sound similar\nto The Visitor: on opening\ntrack, \u2018Procession\u2019, she\nadvises us that \u201cevery\nmorning brings a chance\nto renew, chance to\nrenew,\u201d like some kind of\nspiritual advisor at dawn.\nA marching drum beat\nthen starts up, the military\natmosphere contrasting\nwith the funky bass guitar\nline and fluttering flutes,\nwhich cut through the\nethereal glittering synths\nenshrouding Bonet\u2019s\nvocals. The next track,\n\u2018Childqueen\u2019, starts off\nwith swelling strings,\nbefore morphing into\na laid-back soul track,\nwhich sounds like it\ncould be played over the\nopening credits to a \u201860s\npsych-pop film.\nFrom this point on,\nhowever, Bonet makes\na subtle but noticeable\ndeparture from her sound\non The Visitor: while in\nher first album the tracks\nseemed to be much\nmore free-floating, on\nChildqueen they are often\nanchored by a series of\nincredibly-funky bass\nriffs, giving the songs a lot\nmore energy and presence.\n\u2018Thoughts Around Tea\u2019,\nfor example, features\nrat-a-tat drums pierced\nby stabbing synth pro-gressions, while a looping\nbassline runs underneath\nit all; Bonet\u2019s delivery is\nfluent and funky, as she\nlyrically contorts to fit\naround the pulsating beat.\nShe pulls a similar trick\non \u2018Wings\u2019, stretching her\nvocals around the music,\nelongating a phrase here\nand there to create a sense\nof relentless motion,\nhitting all the right intona-tions.\n\u2018Mother Maybe\u2019,\none of the early singles\nreleased from the album,\nis probably as funky\nas Bonet gets: cymbol\ntapping is overlaid with\nwobbly bass guitar, while\nray-gun synths and organ\nwarbles flow underneath,\nto create a dense tapestry\nof sound. This intense\nweft and warp cuts out\ntowards the end of the\ntrack, as Bonet launches\ninto a series of incredible\nvocal runs, displaying her\nimpressive voice.\nAnd what a voice it is.\nSilky smooth, Bonet\u2019s\nvocals emanate an inner\nwarmth; she manages to\nsound a little a little like\nany number of iconic soul\nvocalists \u2013 Dusty Springfield, Minnie Riperton,\nRoberta Flack \u2013 while\nremaining completely\nidiosyncratic. Often she\u2019ll\nlayer her singing to create\na form of cosmic harmony,\nbut at times she\u2019ll leave\nherself completely\nexposed. The majority of\nher vocals are delivered\nin a sort of whisper-sing-ing, as if she\u2019s speaking\nright into your ear; on\noccasion, however, she\u2019ll\nlet rip, such as on the later\nsections of \u2018Delphine\u2019.\nover her voice, producing\na jelly-like vibrato that\nquivers before stealing\ninto pure, clear notes;\nelsewhere, on \u2018Joy\u2019, she\nmultiplies her voice until\nit resembles an angelic\nchorus. The album ends\nwith the appropriately\ntitled \u2018\u2026\u2019, which culminates in a phenomenal\nseries of vocal acrobatics,\nwith Bonet inching up\nhigher, and higher, and\nhigher, before disap-pearing, transferred onto\nanother astral plane most\nlikely.\nBonet is a hugely\nexciting artist. A talented\nmulti-instrumentalist \u2013\nshe played pretty much\nevery instrument on the\nalbum \u2013 she came out of\nthe gate with an instant-ly-recognisable style,\nconfident in her ability to\nknow exactly who she is.\nWhile sampling from the\nclassic toolbox of psyche-delia, funk, and soul,\nBonet\u2019s production will\ninclude samples of off-kil-ter weirdness \u2013 chirping\nbirds, popping bubbles,\na jazzy flute solo \u2013 that\nensures it never settles\ninto normalcy.\nOn social media, Bonet\nhas admitted to struggles\nwith funding; a European\ntour was cancelled last\nyear, after she said she\nwould be losing too much\nmoney, while her desire to\nproduce music videos has\nbeen stymied by financial\nworries. It\u2019s clear that, as\nan artist, Bonet\u2019s vision is\noutstripping her resourc-es. With the backing she\nso dearly deserves, who\nknows what heights she\ncould scale.\nHow do you like your eggs in the morning? // Fat Possum Records\nMUSIC\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtist: Kadhja Bonet.\nLabel: Fat Possum Top\nTracks: Delphine; Another\nTime Lover; Mother Maybe.\nFor Fans Of: Moses\nSumney; ESKA. 37 minutes\nCHILDQUEEN\n\u201cSilky smooth,\nBonet\u2019s\nvocals always\nemanate an\ninner warmth\u201d\nIt\u2019s the track on this album\nthat sees Bonet\u2019s vocals\nmost up-front. The drums\nare barely-there, and the\nwonky bass, as thick as\nsyrup, allows plenty of\nroom for her to break\nthrough the dizziness,\ncrafting a track that seems\nto drip with yearning.\nOn \u2018Another Time\nLover\u2019 she shows us the\nexcellent control she has\n\n"

The discussion\nreached a shocking\nconclusion when actor\nAsia Argento made a\nspeech during the closing\nceremony, accusing disgraced producer Harvey\nWeinstein of raping her\nat the festival back in\n1997, when she was 21\nyears old. Argento called\nthe festival his \u2018hunting\nground\u2019. Elsewhere,\npresident of the jury\nCate Blanchett \u2013 who is\none of only four female\npresidents in the last 20\nyears \u2013 led 82 women\nin a protest up the set of\nred carpeted stairs. The\nnumber represented the\nnumber of films made by\nwomen that had entered\nthe festival during its 70\nyear history, compared to\n1,645 made by men over\nthe same time period.\nAmid all these\nshocks, however, there\nwas another surprise\nthat had a happier tone:\nShoplifters, the 13th\nfilm\nfrom Japanese director\nHirokazu Kore-eda, took\nhome the Palme d\u2019Or,\nmarking the culmination\nof a twenty year-long\ncareer in which Kore-eda\nhas delivered some of the\nbest-crafted dramas of\nmodern cinema.\nBeginning his career\nin television, Kore-eda\nworked as an assistant\ndirector for TV docu-mentaries, before making\nthe switch to film with a\nseries of documentaries\nin the early 1990s. 1995\nsaw the release of his first\nfeature film, Maborosi,\nwhich centred around a\nwidow trying to make\nsense of the death of her\nhusband, who was hit by\na train while out walking\nby the tracks. The late\nRoger Ebert gave the film\nhis highest rating, saying\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a shot in the\nmovie that\u2019s not graceful\nand pleasing.\u201d\nKore-eda\u2019s real\nbreakthrough came in\n2004, with the release of\nNobody Knows. Taking\ninspiration from the 1988\nSugamo child abandonment case, in which a\nmedia storm was created\nwhen a group of children\nwere found living in a\nTokyo apartment after\nbeing abandoned by\ntheir mother nine months\nearlier, Nobody Knows\ncentres around four\nchildren who are left to\nfend for themselves. Lead\nactor Yuya Yagira became\nthe youngest winner of\nthe Cannes Best Actor\nPrize, for his portrayal\nof Akira, the eldest child\nwho becomes the de facto\nhead of the family.\nFrom then on, Kore-eda\nreleased a film every\ncouple of years, often\nto critical acclaim. Film\ncritics have often pointed\nout the debt he owes to\nYasujiro Ozu, one of the\ngreatest film directors\nof the twentieth century.\nLike Ozu, Kore-eda\u2019s\nfilms often centre around\nthe theme of the family,\nor of relationships, gently\nexploring how we relate\nto others in the world\naround us; that push-pull\nof intimacy and emotion\nthat comes with living\na life closely meshed\nwith others. Kore-eda\u2019s\ncamerawork also conveys\na similar sense of stillness\nas Ozu; often filming from\nlower angles, Kore-eda\nwill meticulously frame\nhis shots, often interspersing them with what\nbecame known in Ozu\u2019s\nwork as \u2018pillow shots\u2019 \u2013\nshort clips of the world\naround the characters,\nidentifying a sense of time\nand place.\nSince 2011, with\nthe release of I Wish,\nKore-eda has become\nmore and more well-known to Western cine-ma-going audiences. Both\nI Wish and the follow-up\nLike Father Like Son\ndeal with the theme of\nthe family, probing at our\nmost basic relationships.\nTaking place over a\nsingle year, Our Little\nSister is a film about the\ngentle rhythms of life:\nwe follow the sisters as\nthey form a close bond,\nthe seasons changing\nfrom winter to spring\nto summer; and as the\nseasons change, the\nfood does too. Our Little\nSister is a film in which\ncuisine plays a central\npart, bringing people\ntogether and reflecting the\nchanging world around us\n\u2013 from making plum wine\nat the height of summer,\nto bonding over whitebait\non toast. It\u2019s a work that\nrevels in the magic of the\nminutiae of everyday life.\nShoplifters screened at\nCannes to critical acclaim,\nwith Peter Bradshaw of\nThe Guardian calling it \u201ca\nmovie made up of delicate\nbrushstrokes: details,\nmoments, looks and\nsmiles.\u201d With any luck, it\nwill be out in UK cinemas\nlater this year, providing\nus with another dose of\nhumanistic cinema from\nthe Japanese master.\nThere has never been a\nbetter time to explore\nKore-eda\u2019s extensive back\ncatalogue, and discover\nhis magic for yourself.\nThe cast of Our Little Sister // Sony Pictures Classics\nShoplifters has been picked up by Magnolia Pictures for its release // Cannes Film Festival\n\u201cKore-eda\u2019s\ndramas\nexplore the\npush-pull of\nintimacy and\nemotion\u201d\nIt is his 2015 film, Our\nLittle Sister, however,\nwhich remains by far my\nfavourite Kore-eda film.\nIt\u2019s one of those films\nthat envelops you in a\nwarm hug, one where\nyou leave the cinema\nfeeling a bit lighter and\nbrighter about the world.\nBased off a manga series,\nOur Little Sister tells the\nstory of three grown-up\nsisters, Sachi, Yoshino,\nand Chika, who live in\nKamakura, a small city\nby the cost. Following the\ndeath of their father, from\nwhom they are estranged,\ntheir half-sister Suzu\nfrom their father\u2019s second\nmarriage comes to live\nwith them, shaking up\ntheir everyday routine.\n\n"

For those who\nhave never heard of this\nterm, stereoisomers are\nmolecules that share the\nsame molecular formula\n(i.e. contain the same\nnumber of atoms of each\nelement) as well as bond\nconnections between\nspecies, but have different\narrangements in the 3-D\nspace. Previous known\nstereoisomers include\nenantiomers, which are\npairs of molecules that\nare non superimposable\nmirror images of each\nother (if you have trouble\nimagining this, think of\nyour right and left hand;\nthey are identical, but\nthere is no physical way\nto superimpose them in\na way that makes both\nof them identical to each\nother).\na porphyrin macrocyclic\nring \u2013 a circular, rigid\nstructure formed by subunits of nitrogen, carbon\nand hydrogen known as\npyrroles and also found in\nhaemoglobin \u2013 the bond\nangle inversion caused\nby the bending of a trio\nof atoms in the molecule\n(a boron-oxygen-boron\nbridge) is fixed in space,\nas rotation is blocked by\nthe ring itself. This would\nnot happen if the molecule\nwas outside the macrocy-cle, as the rotation of the\nbonds would produce a\nmolecule that would be\nidentical to its starting\nconfiguration.\nThe new family of ste-reoisomers has tentatively\nbeen named as Akamptisomers, taking its name\nfrom \u00e1kamptos, the Greek\nterm for \u2018inflexible\u2019.\nThe two possible isomer\nforms corresponding to\nthe opposite orientations\nof the bond angle have\nbeen baptized as \u2018parvo\u2019\nand \u2018amplo\u2019, after the\nLatin words for small and\nlarge, respectively. According to the scientists\nwho made this finding,\nthe new group of isomers\nhave potential to be useful\nin several fields such as\nmedicinal chemistry, as\nthey could be essential for\nthe synthesis and characterization of the active\nprinciples of future drugs.\nOther hypothetical applications of akamptisomers\ninclude their potential use\nin molecular computers.\nFor these devices to work,\nit is essential that the molecules used can change\nbetween two different\nconfigurations. However,\nthe chemists involved in\nthe discovery admitted\nthat, while promising, it is\nvery unlikely that akamp-toisomers will be soon\nmaking an appearance in\ncommercially available\nmolecular computers, as\nmore research is needed\nregarding the stability and\nnature of this new family\nof isomers.\nSCIENCE\nJuan Rubio\nGorrochategui\nScience Writer\nThe breakthrough may bring benefits to medicinal chemistry // CC\n\u201cThe new\nfamily of\nstereoisomers\nhas taken its\nname from\n\u00e1kamptos\n\u2013 Greek for\n\u2018inflexible\u2019\u201d\nThe researchers\ndiscovered the new\nstructure in a molecule\ncalled transoid (BF)O(B-F)-quinoxalinoporphyrin.\nWhen it is surrounded by\nImperial CDT Science festival: Science and Ethics\nT\nhe synergy between Science\nand Ethics is\npervasive in our\nsociety.

The\ndiscussions will provide\na stimulating ground to\naddress the curiosity and\ncommon concerns of the\naudience \u2013 since science\nand ethics are two faces of\nthe same coin.\nTo better connect the\naudience with experts, a\nseries of talks on sustainable innovation, climate\nscience, artificial intelli-gence, genome editing,\nand quantum technologies\nwill take place.\nWould future advances\nin genome editing constitute the ultimate frontier\nfor personalised health-care? Could surgical interventions be fully replaced\nby a new generation of\ngenetic pharmaceuticals,\nwithout compromising\nour identity as species?\nHow will we make\ncomplex decisions in\nmore general critical\nscenarios with (un)clear\nconflicting goals? How\ncan we possibly leverage\ntechnology whilst preserving our values? The\nquestions are endless \u2026\nAt the CDT Science\nFestival, we want to offer\nthe exciting opportunity\nto answer these open\nquestions, understand\nthe related implications,\nand argue about possible\nside-effects each research\narea projects into our own\nlives.\nTalks and discussions\nwill be accompanied by\nPandemic, an interactive\nmovie that allows visitors\nfrom the audience to experience a series of real-life\nethical case questions.\nStudents and young\nresearchers are invited\nto submit posters for\nthe one-day pop-up\n\u2018Sustainable Innovation\nExhibition\u2019, to showcase\nthe ethical implications of\ntheir scientific research.\nSubmissions are now\nopen at http://www.cdtfes-tival.co.uk/.\nA further competition\nwill award the best\nposter addressing the\nfollowing questions:\nwhat are the implications\nof our research?

The main\nproblem with cancer is\nthat it arises from our\nown cells. We are all\nunique and special, but\nso are our tumors, which\nmakes it difficult to deal\nwith them at a population\nlevel. Unfortunately, the\nsame drug might not have\nthe same effect on two\ndifferent people, even\nthough they might have\nthe same kind of cancer.\nAs we wait for personalised medicine to develop\nin the future, scientists\nare currently trying to\nenhance our natural and\nalready personalised\ndefence mechanisms: our\nimmune system.\nIn general, people associate the immune system\nwith the body\u2019s mechanism of defense against\nviral, fungal, and bacterial\ninfections. But this is not\nall it does \u2013 it also fights\nback against cancer. There\nis plenty of evidence\nshowing how important a\nrole the immune system\nplays in keeping cancer at\nbay. People with immuno-deficiencies, for example,\nare known to be more\nprone to develop tumors.\nsome of the cells of the\nimmune system to their\nadvantage, providing\nthem with more glucose\n(food) and oxygen to facilitate their growth.Apart\nfrom this comfort, cancer\ncells become invisible\nand thus protected from\nthe rest of the immune\nsystem, which would\notherwise eliminate them.\nMore specifically, there\nare two families of cells\nbelonging to the immune\nsystem that generally\nbecome cancer friendly:\ncancer associated-mac-rophages and regulatory\nT cells.\nCancer cells can\ntherefore become reliant\non these particular cell\nfamilies for their survival.\nAnd so, researchers\nare currently working\non ways to exploit this\nweakness. Individual disruption of the cancer-as-sociated macrophages or\nthe regulatory T cells has\nso far failed to provide\nany satisfactory results,\nthe reason being that upon\ndysfunction in one of\nthese cell families there\nis a tendency for the other\nto increase in terms of\nnumber and functionality.\nThere seems, in other\nwords, to be a compensatory effect. With this\nin mind, researchers at\nthe Babraham Institute\nemployed a dual strategy\nin which they managed to\ndisrupt both cell families\nsimultaneously. In their\nrecent publication, they\nshow that in a colon\ncancer model in mice this\ntreatment promotes the\nimmune system rejection\nof the cancer. By the end\nof the study half of the\nmice were completely\ntumor free. Although\nmuch more research needs\nto be done, the inhibitor of\nthe T regulatory cells they\nused is already approved\nas a treatment for some\ncancers, so this new\nstrategy could potentially\nbe easily translated into\nthe clinic.\nConsidering how\ncomplex cancer is as a\ndisease, boosting our own\nimmune system to battle\nit is a strategy that might\nserve to overcome current\nlimitations when the medications we do have stop\nworking.\nSCIENCE\nRoser Gonzalez\nScience Writer\nCancer cells dividing under the microscope // CC\n\u201cStrikingly,\nsome cancers\nhave been\nshown to\ncreate a micro-environment,\nusing the\nimmune\nsystem to their\nadvantage\u201d\nSo, why does cancer\nemerge in a person with a\nhealthy immune system?\nCancer is the result of the\nuncontrolled growth of as\nlittle as one of our own\ncells. Since these cells\nreplicate quite fast, they\noften acquire mutations\nthat can make them resistant to current medication\nor even the detection of\nthe immune system itself.\nMore strikingly, some\ncancers have been shown\nto create a microenviron-ment in which they use\nWant to be involved in Felix next year?\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!

Reader,\nI was wrong. It wasn\u2019t\nuntil speaking to friends\nfrom other universities\nthat I realised how odd\nthe Centrefold actually\nis.

In particular,\nconsider what data are\ncollected about you and\nwhere they are stored.\nWhat information is collected by your FitBit? Do\nyou trust the government\nof a country in whose\nelections you cannot vote\nto have power over sensitive information about you\n\u2013 say, about your sexual\norientation? This is where\nGDPR comes in. Under\nGDPR, you are granted\nseveral important rights.\nGDPR gives you the right\nto object to your personal\ndata being processed for\nmarketing purposes. Furthermore, it allows you\nto obtain access to these\npersonal data and to have\nthem erased when they are\nno longer needed. GDPR\nalso gives some further\nrights and imposes heavy\npenalties on organizations for not complying\nor if their user\u2019s data is\nbreached (see left).\nprovide a free service, and\ntherefore people have no\noption but to accept the\nstatus quo to continue to\nuse the Internet. How can\nwe know when you toggle\na button on a website\nyour choice is taken into\naccount? Do you know\nin what form information\nabout you is stored?\nFurthermore, many\napps and websites\ncontinue to collect sensitive information even if\nthe most stringent privacy\nsettings are enabled.\nMany advertisers claim to\noffer the option to opt-out\nof personalized advertis-ing, but they make it as\ndifficult as possible to do\nthis. There are exceptions.\nMakeUseOf, for instance\nhas a very clear interface\nwhich lets you toggle off\nthe collection of data.\nHowever, most users\nwho are sufficiently concerned use an adblocker\nwhich denies revenue\nto the website. They do\nso because it physically\nprevents the transmission\nof sensitive information\nso it gives them peace of\nmind. As it stands today,\nthe World Wide Web\nis designed so copious\namounts of sensitive\ninformation are collected\nin a manner not possible\ntwo decades ago. We have\nnot had time to get an\nintuition for what risks we\nare taking when we use\nthe World Wide Web.\nAs long as personal information is collected and\nstored in form to which\na single organization has\nphysical access , there is\nalways a risk that it will\nbe abused, whether that be\ndue to hacking, interference from the government\nof the country where the\ninfrastructure is located,\nor for the sake of making\na profit.\nAs Francis Bacon\nsaid, knowledge is\npower. Information is\nknowledge. Knowledge\nabout how people behave\ngives power to influence\nfuture behaviour. Today\nthe power of information\ncollected by websites and\napps is largely used to\ninfluence our shopping\nhabits through advertis-ing. However, this power\ncould be used to engineer\nsociety to various political\nends. Legislation such\nas GDPR is like a soft\nmeasure against someone\nwith access to data and\na lack of moral compass\ncrossing the Rubicon and\nturning the data against\nthe users\u2019 best interests.\nWe should consider\nwhether we need to\nredesign the World Wide\nWeb to make it physically\nimpossible for the data to\nbe compromised.\nbe to make a change in\nbusiness model so as not\nto rely on personalized\nadvertising, which would\nresolve the conflict in\ninterests between the\nuser and data holder.\nLarge-scale voluntary\ncollaborations such as\nMozilla, Wikimedia, and\nthe open-source instant\nmessaging app Telegram\ndemonstrate these are\nscalable and sustainable\nsolutions. Alternatively,\nusers could pay a monthly\nsubscription fee for access\nto services like apps or\nwebsites, which would\nthen be divided among the\nwebsites based on their\nusage. This idea already\nhas immense traction \u2013 it\nis precisely what Spotify\ndoes for music and Netflix\ndoes for film.\nFinally, new decentralized systems are currently\nbeing developed by\nthe likes of MaidSAFE\nand InterPlanetary\nFile System (IPFS) in\nwhich users contribute\ncomputing resources to\nthe network (like Bit\nTorrent) and are rewarded\nusing a blockchain-based\ncurrency. Such systems\nwould reward the content\ncreators (i.e. the users)\nand those who contribute\ndata storage or computing resources to the\nnetwork. With the costs\nto companies which base\ntheir business on surveillance for inevitable data\nbreaches justly imposed\nby GDPR, this seems increasingly the more viable\noption.\n\u201cGDPR cannot\nprotect\npersonal\ninformation\nfrom being\ncollected, or\nguarantee it\nwill not be\ncompromised\u201d\nWhat you can do?\n1. Take a moment to review your privacy options over the\nnext few days in your apps. Get to know what information is\ncollected about you and if you can disable it.\n2. You don\u2019t have to agree to the terms and conditions. Instead\nofGoogle,OneDrive,andWhatsAppwhynottryDuckDuckGo\nSearch (https://ddg.gg ), CryptPad (https://cryptpad.fr/ ),\nor Telegram (https://telegram.org/) which offer equivalent\nservices for free but do not collect unnecessary amounts\nof personalized information. The website \u201cPRISM Break\u201d\n(https://prism-break.org/en/all/) has further suggestions.\n3. Takepartinmakingabetterweb.Areyouareinterestedinthe\neffects of technology on society?

As a society\nwe need to rethink the\nbusiness models behind\nthe services we use , and\nredesign technology so\nas to ensure that our data\ncannot be breached in the\nfirst place by replacing\nour current centralized\nsystems.\nAs an individual, take\nthe opportunity now to\nfind out what information\nservices collect about you.\nWith exams over, why not\ndownload your Facebook\ndata and play around with\nit if you are so inclined?\nFurthermore you do not\nhave to agree to the terms\nand conditions if you are\nuncomfortable! Why not\nsupport efforts to make\nthe web more open and try\nan alternative service such\nas DuckDuckGo instead\nof Google, or Telegram\ninstead of WhatsApp. For\nmore ideas on what you\ncan do see below.\nOrganizations are\ntaking GDPR seriously.\nThat barrage of emails and\npopups may be annoying,\nbut it is a sign that companies are concerned about\nnot complying.\nHowever, GDPR\ncannot protect personal\ninformation from being\ncollected or guarantee it\nwill not be compromised.\nMost websites on the\nWorld Wide Web today\nrely on personalized\nadvertising in order to\n\u201cThe power of\ninformation\ncollected\nby websites\ncould be used\nto engineer\nsociety to\nvarious\npolitical aims\u201d\nOne solution is to treat\nservices such as social\nmedia platforms as crucial\ninfrastructure, and divide\nup their administration\namong independent or-ganisations. This would\ncome at the advantage of\ngreater robustness as well\nas security, since there\nwould no single point\nof attack. An example is\nthe social media network\nDiaspora as a replacement for Facebook, in\nwhich you can establish\nyour own \u201cpod\u201d which\nmanages data.\nThe primary issue\nwith this option is that of\napathy amongst Internet\nusers. Social media have\nan inherent tendency to\nmonopolization, because\ntheir value is increased\nby each user who joins\nthe network.

Just as the Kyoto\nProtocol showed nations\ncan come together to\ntake meaningful action\nfor the future of the\nnatural world, GDPR\nshows nations can come\ntogether for the future of\nthe cybernetic world. For\ntoo long the World Wide\nWeb, originally a decentralized means of freely\nsharing information, has\nbecome centralized and\nmonopolized by a few\nkey players. The risks are\ndemonstrated by countless\ndata breaches, the worst\nrevealed this year being\nthe Cambridge Analytica\nfiles and MyFitnessPal\ncases. We each need to\nrealise what information\nis being collected about\nus, and to take action not\njust as a society, but as\nindividuals.

The map\nwas sufficiently detailed\nto show routes uploaded\nby US soldiers in Afghanistan giving away sensitive information about the\nlayout of military bases.\nFurthermore, the monopolization of global services\nby corporations tied to the\nlaws of individual nations\nis harming competition\nand is inherently undem-ocratic.\nCambridge Analytica is the highest-profile case of data harvesting // Flickr/thoughtcatalog\nYour Rights under GDPR\nAs stated on the EU commission\u2019s\nwebsite under GDPR you have the right to:\n1. information about the processing of\nyour personal data;\n2. obtain access to the personal data\nheld about you;\n3. ask for incorrect, inaccurate or\nincomplete personal data to be\ncorrected;\n4. request that personal data be erased\nwhen it\u2019s no longer needed or if\nprocessing it is unlawful;\n5. object to the processing of your\npersonal data for marketing\npurposes or on grounds relating to\nyour particular situation;\n6. request the restriction of the\nprocessing of your personal data in\nspecific cases;\n7. receive your personal data in a\nmachine-readable format and\nsend it to another controller (\u2018data\nportability\u2019);\n8. request that decisions based on\nautomated processing concerning\nyou or significantly affecting you\nand based on your personal data are\nmade by natural persons, not only by\ncomputers.

Rejoice, culture lovers \u2013 Felix is on hand with some of the top recommendations for\na summer of art and culture.\nARTS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nhere\u2019s a strange\nparadox within\nthe London\ncultural scene:\nas soon as summer hits,\nwith the days growing\nlonger, and the evenings\nstretching out before us to\nthe horizon, theatres and\ngalleries begin to close\nshop, using the summer\nmonths to prepare\ntheir new seasons. It\u2019s\nunfortunate, since July\nthrough to September is\nthe period when most of\nus have more time to go\nout and explore the city \u2013\nalthough, as student loans\nbegin to dry up, this lack\nof shows and exhibitions\nmight be a blessing in\ndisguise. Never fear \u2013\nFelix are here, to give you\nrecommendations on all\nthe best cultural things to\ndo this summer, without\nbreaking the bank:\nGlobe Summer Season\nMidsummer is when\nShakespeare\u2019s Globe\nreally comes into its own.\nWith the top of the theatre\nopen to the elements, the\nmonths through from\nApril to October are the\nonly time the Globe can\nrely on weather clement\nenough to run perfor-mances. Even then, the\nnotoriously temperamental British climate means\nyou\u2019ll always be taking a\nbit of a risk when going\nto see something. It\u2019s all\npart of the charm of going\nto the Globe, which is a\nquintessentially summery\nLondon activity. As usual,\ngroundling tickets \u2013 for\nstanding in the yard \u2013 are\nonly \u00a35 for most perfor-mances, making the Globe\none of the most accessible\ntheatres in the UK.\nThis year\u2019s season\nhas some classics from\nShakespeare\u2019s repertoire\n\u2013 Hamlet, Othello, Love\u2019s\nLabour\u2019s Lost \u2013 but the\nteam are also putting\non a series of talks and\nworkshops exploring how\nShakespeare continues to\nbe relevant to the modern\nday. Discussions, perfor-mances, and events will\nlook at race within Shakespeare, as well as the idea\nof censorship in the world\nof theatre. New work by\nMorgan Lloyd Malcolm,\nJude Christian, and Matt\nHartley will also be\nperformed, while events\ncompletely unrelated to\nShakespeare \u2013 such as the\nAlternative Miss World\ncompetition \u2013 will be held\nin the famous venue.\nThe Globe\u2019s Summer\nSeason runs through to to\nOctober.\nSerpentine Pavilion\nThe Serpentine\nPavilion, which pops up\nfor a few months in front\nof the Hyde Park gallery,\nhas become a London\nsummer institution. As\nInstagram and social\nmedia have exploded,\nthe Pavilion has become,\nmore than ever, the place\nto be seen to be. This\nyear, in its 18th\niteration,\nthe commission has gone\nto Frida Escobedo, a\nMexican architect, who\nwill hopefully create a\nspace that feels more\nintimate and reflective.\nAt 39, Escobedo is the\nyoungest architect to\ncreate a pavilion, and\nhas drawn her inspiration\nfrom a number of sources:\nthe pavilion itself will be\nconstructed out of cheap-ly-produced Mexican\nroof tiles, overlaid in\na lattice structure; one\ncourtyard within the space\nis angled to line up with\nthe Greenwich Meridian,\nmeaning visitors will get\nto experience a play of\nlight as it reflects off pools\nof water and the ceiling,\nchanging subtly throughout the day. El Lissitzky\u2019s\n\u2018Proun\u2019 artworks, which\ninterrogate ideas of space\nand perspective, have\nalso been a key reference\npoint, with Escobedo\nhoping to create a \u201cspace\nof discovering\u201d within the\nPavilion.\nWhile visiting the\npavilion, you can also\ncheck out the exhibition\nof Christo and JeanClaude\u2019s massive sculptural interventions within\nthe urban landscape \u2013\nprevious projects included\nwrapping the Reichstag in\nfabric \u2013 on display in the\nmain gallery.\nThe Serpentine Pavillion runs from 15th\nJune to\n7th\nOctober.\nSerpentine Pavilion 2018, designed by Frida Escobedo // Iwan Baan\nYoung Vic \u2013 Fun Home\nCartoonist Alison\nBechdel may be most\nfamous for the cinematic\ntest that bears her name\n\u2013 does a film have two\nfemale characters, who\ntalk to each other about\nsomething other than a\nman? \u2013 but her graphic\nnovel Fun Home, released\nin 2006, is one of the best\nmemoirs to come out in\nthe noughties. It tells the\nstory of Bechdel\u2019s childhood in Pennsylvania,\nand the tyrannical rule of\nher father, a high school\nEnglish teacher and\nfuneral director. Bechdel\nexplores not only her own\nburgeoning sexuality, but\nalso that of her father, who\nwas in the closet throughout his life. Through a recursive structure, Bechdel\ntraces the events leading\nup to her father\u2019s death,\nfiltered through a rich,\nliterary layer of allusion\nand reference.\nThis summer sees the\nmusical version of the\ngraphic novel, which won\nfive Tony awards, including Best Musical, coming\nto London\u2019s Young\nVic. When it opened in\nBroadway in 2015, it\nwas critically-acclaimed,\nwith The New York Times\ncalling its score a \u2018masterpiece\u2019. It\u2019s sure to be one\nof the hottest tickets of the\nsummer, so make sure to\nget in early for a chance to\nsee it.\nFun Home runs 18\u00adth\nJune to 1st\nSeptember.\nTickets from \u00a310.\nBarbican \u2013 Dorothea\nLange/Vanessa Winship Double Bill\nThe Barbican Gallery\nfollow on from their\nsterling group photography exhibition Unseen\nWorlds, which looked at\nthose on the fringes of\nsociety,withaphotograph-ic double bill. Dorothea\nLange is best known for\nher iconic photograph\nMigrant Mother, which\ncame to be representative\nof the Great Depression\nin the USA, as well as\nher work for the Farm\nSecurity Administration\n(FSA) documenting the\nplight of sharecroppers.\nShe later went on to\ncover the internment of\nJapanese-Americans\nduring the Second World\nWar \u2013 a shameful chapter\nof American history.\nTo both settings, Lange\nbrought her remarkable\nhumanistic eye, showing\nthe individuals behind the\nmass tragedies.\nHer work is paired with\nVanessa Winship, the crit-ically-renowned British\nportrait photographer,\nwhose black and white\nphotographs share the\nsame arresting empathy\nas Lange\u2019s work. Winner\nof numerous awards,\nshe works primarily in\nEastern Europe, turning\nher lens onto a range\nof individuals as she\nconveys the fragility of\nboth the landscape and the\nindividual.\nNational Theatre \u2013\nThe Lehman Trilogy\nLehman Brothers is\na name that, instanta-neously, conjures up\nthe ghost of the 2008\nfinancial crash, whose\neffects are still being felt\naround the world today.\nThe images of the office\nworkers, carrying out\ntheir cardboard boxes on\nthe morning of September\n15th\n, 2008, have become\niconic representations\nof the modern era. This\nsummer, the National\nTheatre takes on the\nstory of the bank, and\nhow it came to exist, in\ntheir production of The\nLehman Trilogy, Stefano\nMassini\u2019s sprawling, epic\nproduction. Coming in at\nnearly four hours long,\nand told in three parts over\nthe course of an evening,\nSam Mendes \u2013 director\nof Skyfall and American\nBeauty \u2013 will be responsible for ensuring it doesn\u2019t\nrun away from us. He will\nbe directing a stellar cast,\nincluding Simon Russell\nBeale, while set designer\nEs Devlin (The Nether,\nChimerica) is to bring a\ngrand sense of scale to the\nproduction.\nThe Lehman Trilogy is\non at the National Theatre\n4th\nJuly to 22nd\nSeptember.\nTickets limited.\nWhite Cube \u2013 Memory\nPalace\nLondon is absolutely\nfilled with independent\ncommercial galleries,\nwhich often do individual\nor group shows of some\nof the most interesting\ncontemporary artists\nworking today. All too\noften, however, people\navoid them, for fear\nthey\u2019ll stick out like a sore\nthumb. The White Cube\ngalleries have managed\nto establish themselves as\na sort of halfway house\nbetween the tucked away,\nappointment-only commercial galleries and the\nmajor blockbuster venues\nlike the Tate or Royal\nAcademy.\nThis summer sees\nthem putting on one of\ntheir largest group shows\nin recent memory, split\nbetween their two London\ngalleries in Bermondsey\nand St. James\u2019s. Memory\nPalace promises to be\nan exhibition that will\n\u201cinspire reflection on\nthe forms and themes\nof memory.\u201d It features\nover forty artists, including the who\u2019s who of\ncontemporary art: Eddie\nPeake, Antony Gormley,\nCerith Wyn Evans \u2013 the\nlist goes on. The exhibition also promises to\nbe a highly-international\naffair, with exhibited\nartists ranging from Mona\nHatoum, whose evocative\ninstallations challenge our\nvisions of the world, to He\nXiangyu,whoexploresthe\ncontradictions inherent in\nmodern industrial society.\nMemory Palace is on at\nthe White Cube Bermondsey and Mason\u2019s Yard 11th\nJuly to 2nd\nSeptember.\nFree admission\nTate Modern \u2013 Christian Marclay: The\nClock\nSometimes, the idea\nfor a work of art is so\nbrilliantly simplistic, you\nwonder why it hasn\u2019t been\nthought of before. This\nwas surely the reaction\nto Christian Marclay\u2019s\ninstallation piece The\nClock, which debuted\nat the White Cube in\nLondon back in 2010, and\nreturns to the UK for the\nfirst time in seven years.\nThe Clock is a 24-hour\nvideo, running on a loop,\nin which Marclay has\ncompiled a wide range of\nfilm and TV scenes featuring clocks, timepieces,\nor references to the time.\nThe film tells the correct\ntime \u2013 so if you visit it at\n2.30pm, the scenes will\nbe showing clocks at that\nexact minute. At once\nsimplistic and complex,\nthe piece took over three\nyears to create, and won\nthe Golden Lion at the\nVenice Biennale when it\nwas exhibited.\nPrevious iterations\nof The Clock have seen\nlengthy queues, but \u2013 with\nthe Tate Modern showing\nit through until January \u2013\nthere will be a long time\nfor Londoners to catch it.\nWithin the shots, Marclay\nbuilds up his own sense\nof rhythm, grouping\nsimilar shots together\nto manipulate the audience\u2019s emotions, creating\nfeelings of tension,\ndrama, and tenderness.\nOnce a month, the Tate\nModern will stay open all\nnight, giving cinephiles\nand art-lovers alike the\nchance to see the piece in\nall its glory.\nThe Clock is on 14th\nSeptember 2018 to 20th\u00ad\nJanuary 2019.

On the right you can see\na diagram showing how these\ndifferent interests link up. The\nred points are individual sex\nacts, while the orange lines\nindicate common interests:\npeople who said they were into receiving cunnilingus, for example, were\nalso more likely to enjoy giving handjobs. The thicker the line, the closer the\nassociation was.\nSome clear patterns emerge in the diagram: towards the bottom of the\nvisualisation were primarily respondents who identified as women, and who\nenjoyed, for example, receiving cunnilingus or giving fellatio. In the top right\ncorner, you\u2019re more likely to find people who identify as men \u2013 they enjoy giving\ncunnilingus, or getting a handjob.\nTowards the centre are acts without significant gender divides \u2013 BDSM,\nfor example, or the use of sex toys. Finally, in the top left corner you can find\nresponents of a range of genders, who were into what we might term the\n\u2018kinkier\u2019side of sex \u2013 orgies, pegging, and watersports.\nWithin the network, different \u2018constellations\u2019 emerge, as associations\nare revealed: there\u2019s a strong link between receiving and giving anilingus,\nwhile enjoying threesomes seems to be a gateway drug to pup play \u2013 or\nvice versa. See what connections you can make out!\nSexual health is always a big topic at universities,\nbut the Sex Survey revealed a significant proportion\nof sexually active people had never been tested.\nOverall, 48.4% of sexually active respondents had\nnever been tested for STIs, with a further 15% tested\nmore than a year ago. Around 27% of respondents\nhad been tested within the last six months.\nChlamydia, Gonorrhoea, and HIV were the main\ninfections people were tested for, although a\nsignificant number had also been tested for other\ndiseases like syphilis. Chlamyida was the most\ncommonly-diagnosed condition.\nFor those who hadn\u2019t been tested, a range of\nreasons were given. Common responses included\nsayingitwastoomuchefforttogettested,ofpeopledidn\u2019tknowwheretogo.Therearenumerous\nsexual health clinics located close to Imperial campuses that students can use, with the Jefferiss\nWing at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, and 10 Hammersmith Broadway being only two examples. More can\nbe found on the NHS website. Others said they didn\u2019t need to be tested because they were in a\ncommitted relationship, or had only had sex with one person. Felix don\u2019t want to cause dischord\nin relationships, but it might be an idea to get tested, just in case. And remember: some STIs will\nbe largely symptomless until late stages, so don\u2019t wait to get tested!\nBirds do it, bees do it, even educated Imperial\nstudents do it. Yes, we\u2019re talking about wanking.\nThe overwhelming majority of respondants\nmasturbated from time to time, with the most\ncommon frequency being every few days.\nCategories of porn, although predictable, showed significant differences\nbased on whether the respondant identifyed as heterosexual or not. For\nheterosexual respondants, the most popular categories were\n\u2018College\u2019, \u2018Teen\u2019, and \u2018Lesbian\u2019. Other categories were also popular \u2013\n\u2018Female Friendly\u2019 was surprisingly popular amongst respondants,\nlargely women, while \u2018Point of View\u2019 was popular among pretty\nmuch only men \u2013 but there were some clear stand-outs.\nPorn watched by non-heterosexual respondants \u2013 so bisexual,\ngay, lesbian, pansexual etc. \u2013 was much more varied, with no single\ncategory emerging as the outright favourite. \u2018Teen\u2019 and \u2018College\u2019\nremained popular, although \u2018Lesbian\u2019 was less popular than in the\nheterosexual group. \u2018Threesome/Orgy\u2019 was more popular, as were\n\u2018Anal\u2019 and \u2018Gay\u2019. Non-heterosexual respondants also preferred\n\u2018Amateur\u2019 pornography much more than their heterosexual\ncounterparts.\n18.1% of respondents viewed porn every day, while nearly\nhalf viewerd it a couple of times a week, and the remainder less\nfrequently. Overall, 13.4% were worried about their consumption\nof pornography, while 21.7% were not sure, and 65% didn\u2019t have\nconcerns.

Love is built upon\npassion, but it doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily exist after\npassion. Some people are\nmature and caring enough\nto be able to build the\nlove, some are not: it is\nas simple as that. To love\nsomeone, you must love\nyourself first: you have\nto know yourself, to be\nsure of who you are and\nwhat you want in life. If\nyou are not self-aware,\nself-conscious, there is no\nway you will be able to\nlove someone.\nsorry, I am like this with\nthe people I love\u201d. Let me\ntell you something: that is\nnot love.\nI was the one cleaning\nup the mess. I do not\nhave the best background\nwhen it comes to rela-tionships: I grew up in an\nenvironment of domestic\nviolence, a totally abusive\nrelationship. Research\nsays I will now, when\nfinding a partner, try to fix\nwhat was not fixed back\nthen between my parents;\nliving in that environment\nmade me stronger but\nalso made me much more\ntolerant to bullshit.\nI did not respect myself\nin my first real relation-ship. I realise now my\nfirst true love gives me\nmore anger than good\nmemories. It is not sad\nto realise that; in fact, it\nmakes me grow, it makes\nme more aware, so I do\nnot repeat the mistake.\nI have got nothing to\nlose by writing this; in\nfact, it only makes me\nreflect more about what\nI did to myself. No, I do\nnot blame myself. I have\nno right to blame myself.\nI lost myself because I\ngave everything I had. It\nwould have been fine if\nthat everything had been\ngiven to me \u2013 from me to\nme \u2013 but, surprise: it was\nnot. You grow by making\nmistakes, and I committed one of the biggest\nmistakes of my life so far:\nI gave myself away, com-pletely, entirely. Months\nafter, I found myself\nin pieces, from being\ntrampled on numerous\ntimes. You would think\nI would realise what was\ngoing on, but I did not.\nCurrently, I am slowly\ngluing the pieces back\ntogether. Sometimes, a\npiece falls and I have to\npick it up again, without\nreally knowing if it will\nstick properly this time.\nIt is a constant fight, a\nconstant fight to rediscover me. I want it to\nbe clear: I do not need a\nLeave. There is nothing to\nlose. If you stay, you will\nlose yourself. So, leave.\nI have no shame to say\nI got out of it by being\nbroken up with. That is\nokay. I still get to leave, I\nstill get to grow, and I still\nget to realise all the shit\nthat happened during the\nrelationship: specially all\nthe red flags that existed, I\nnoticed, and I ignored.\nFrida Kahlo \u2013 Two Fridas (1939) // Flickr/cea +\n\u201cIf you have a\npartner, they\ndo not exist\nto clean up\nyour mess:\nthey don\u2019t\nhave to deal\nwith selfish\nbehaviour\u201d\nsticker saying \u201cfragile\u201d.\nIf I were to be described\nthat way, then the whole\nworld would have to be\ndescribed that way too.\nAccepting yourself is\nthe first step to take before\nentering any relationship.\nIf you do, do not be with\nsomeone who does not\naccept themselves. I did\nthis and found myself in\na cycle, trying to make\nthings better when there\nwas really nothing I could\ndo, because he was only\nfighting against himself. If\nyou feel like leaving, just\nleave. If you feel like you\nare losing yourself, leave.\nIf it feels like it is not right,\nit is because it is not right.\nBy not knowing\nyourself or having your\nshit together you can\neasily drag those who\ncare for you down with\nyour mess: no one has to\ndeal with your shit. If you\nhave a partner, they do\nnot exist to clean up your\nmess; they exist to support\nyou and help you, but that\ndoes not mean that they\nhave to deal with selfish\nbehaviour on your part,\nwith you saying \u201cI am so\n\u201cIf I were to\nbe described\nas\u2018fragile\u2019the\nwhole world\nwould have to\nbe too\u201d\nI wrote this because I\nam sure I am not alone.\nI want to make people\naware of my story, because\nI know this is happening\nto multiple people right\nnow I feel if I had read\nsomething like this while\nstill in the relationship\nthings could have been\ndifferent; I would have\nbeen able to raise my head\nup and leave earlier, or be\nable to make the red flags\nreal, and not just thoughts\nto ignore.\nDo not let yourselves\ngo.

After all,\nstudents wouldn\u2019t be\nmotivated to make things\nbetter if they thought that\nthings were already good\nenough. Usually, this negativity is channelled into\nproductivity; the drive to\nimprove things has been\nat the heart of virtually\nevery positive change the\nUnion has brought about\nat Imperial. Volunteers\nand sabbatical officers\nhave always worked\ntogether for the common\ngood of Imperial\u2019s student\nbody \u2013 even if they often\ndisagreed on details or\ndidn\u2019t get along particularly well.\nthis year it has grown\ntoxic. Personal animosity\nhas been allowed to dictate\nthe agenda; proposals\nare voted down purely\nbecause of who proposed\nthem, without any consideration of their merit.\nHard-working volunteers\nare sniped at and openly\nundermined in meetings,\nand partisan emails are\nsent to society mailing\nlists \u2013 one described\nUnion Council members\nas \u201cpeople who care very\nlittle about students, and\nare using their seat on\nCouncil just as a stepping\nstone to more senior\nUnion positions.\u201d Worse\nstatements have been\nmade in private.\nThis toxicity is not\nlimited to one or two\nprominent individuals.\nRather, two distinct\nfactions have emerged,\nwhich together account\nfor virtually the entirety of\nthe Union\u2019s senior officer\ncohort, from Constituent\nUnion committees all\nthe way up to the Officer\nEvery action and every\nproposal is viewed almost\nexclusively through the\nprism of which faction the\nindividual is more closely\nassociated with; no more\ndoes the Union\u2019s senior\nofficer community accept\n\u2013 even begrudgingly \u2013\npositive steps proposed\nby those they don\u2019t get\nalong with personally.\nInstead, flimsy excuses\nare cobbled together to\nmake sure that \u2018they\u2019\ndon\u2019t achieve anything.\nAfter all, isn\u2019t it best that\nnothing at all happens, just\nso long as \u2018the other side\u2019\ndon\u2019t get the credit\u2026?\nI have always, throughout my time holding\nvolunteering roles, been\nparticularly optimistic,\ndespite the Union\u2019s\nnegativity. I have always\nbelieved the Union could\nachieve great things,\nif only we could work\ntogether, and have worked\nto try to bring about\nthat unanimity and find\ncommon ground on difficult issues. However, the\nworking atmosphere has\nbeen so bad in the Union\nthis year I have several\ntimes seriously considered\nsimply walking away. It\nmay be that this year has\nbeen an aberration, a bad\nbunch of people incapable\nof working together. I sincerely hope so; the Union\nis doomed to failure in\neverything it does if its\nculture does not improve.\nEvery single student with\nan elected role next year\nmust do everything they\ncan to make sure that it\nnever gets this bad again;\nto fail to do so is to doom\nthe Union.\nGrumpy Bastard and the World Cup\nGrumpy Bastard is looking forward to the World Cup. Because they hate themselves.\nW\nelcome to\nthe end of\nthe year.\nWhether it\u2019s\nyour first, second, third,\nor even fourth year at this\nfine institution, I\u2019m sure\nyou have all arrived in the\nsame manner: bedraggled,\nexhausted, and with the\neyes of a survivor of an\nartillery barrage on the\nWestern Font. For those\nof you still here beyond\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nfour years, please contact\nthe police, as you probably have an advanced\nand untreatable form of\nStockholm Syndrome as\nwell as chronic self-hate.\nIf I\u2019m honest, the self-hate\nnever really goes, you just\nlearn to hate everyone else\nuntil it feels normal.\nI am really looking\nforward to the summer\nthis ear, mostly because\nof the World Cup. As an\nashamed Englishperson,\nit really is wonderful to\ngo through the same masochistic expectation that\nmaybe this year, the boys\nin white will make it all the\nway, only to eventually be\ndefeated by some country\nthat no one has even heard\nof, like Belgium. I think\nit\u2019s entirely in keeping\nwith a people that loathes\nitself so completely as to\nvote the Tories into power\nthat we care desperately\nabout a sport that we have\nabsolutely no hope of\nwinning. It almost brings\na patriotic tear to my eye.\nAnother wonderful\naspect of the World Cup\nthis year is the country\nin which it is held. Never\nbefore has an openly\nexpansionist, homophobic\nregime landed itself with\nsuch a propaganda coup.\nCome to think of it, I\ncan think of one other\nregime, but I don\u2019t think\nthat the Nazis had to bribe\nthe Olympic officials\nanywhere near as much\nas Putin had to give to\nSep Blatter and all of his\nfriends. Something that\ncould be very interesting\ncould be when the rival\nnationalist \u201cfirms\u201d come\ninto contact with one\nanother. Firms, in case you\ndidn\u2019t know are groups of\nyoung en taht associate\nwith different football\nclubs and occasionally\nmeet to beat the shit out\nof one another. I guess if\nI was from Manchester\nI\u2019d want an early death\ntoo. As two nations with\na history of violence and\nthen making it the rest\nof the world\u2019s problem, I\nthink it will be really nice\nto watch a proper confrontation between the pair of\nus. Let\u2019s just hope that\nthe FSB stops threatening\nthe Mafia bosses and firm\nleaders long enough for\nthe true competition to\ntake place. I mean it\u2019s not\nlike they do it the rest of\nthe time.\nOverall, I can\u2019t say I\nhave high expectations\nof this summer\u2019s football\nrelated phenomena. I just\nexpect to be greeted by\nthe site of more England\nflags, a surge in the\nmembership of the EDL\nand more obnoxious dick-heads blowing Vuvuzelas\nin public. All I want is for\nthem to shut up so that I\ncan continue to worry\nabout the implications of\nthe Singapore conference\nin peace. That and shitting\nmyself over exam results.\nGrumpy Bastard would\nlike to wish everyone the\nbest for the summer, but\nis completely unable to.\nGoodbye dickheads.\n\u201cThis year the\natmosphere\nin the Union\nhas grown\ncompletely\ntoxic\u201d\nThis year, however,\nsomething has changed.\nWhereas previously the\natmosphere amongst\nsenior Union officers has\nbeen fairly polite, if not\nexactly always friendly,\n\u201cThe Union\nis doomed\nto failure in\neverything\nit does if its\nculture does\nnot improve\u201d\nTrustees \u2013 who at times\nin the year have happily\ncontributed to the ev-er-worsening atmosphere.\n\n"

It then became a listicle, before reverting back to thinkpiece. Whatever\nform it now takes, it\u2019s my final article of the year so you\u2019d better bloody enjoy it.\nMUSIC\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nT\nhe recent release of Arctic\nM o n k e y s \u2019\nTranquillity Base\nHotel & Casino divided\nfans. A far cry from the\nangst-laden and frenetic\nrock of the noughties,\nTBH&C brought with it a\ntoned-down, lounge vibe,\nfilled with nuances and\nsubtleties rather foreign\nto their previously brash\nand unapologetically\nfrank discography. While\nmany embraced their new\nsound, a not insignificant\nsubset heralded the\nswerve as a betrayal of\ntheir original fanbase.\nDespite the widespread\nuproar, this change of\nmusical direction pales\nin comparison to some\nof those taken by crucial\nartists throughout history.\nIn each, a bold risk was\ntaken \u2013 potentially alienating the very people whose\nsupport enabled them to\ntake the leap in the first\nplace. Inevitably, many\nflopped. Others, however,\nchanged the musical landscape for good.\nDylan goes electric\nIn the early sixties, Bob\nDylan was a figurehead of\nfolk. Only acoustic guitar\nand harmonica accompanied his carefully crafted\nnarratives and protest\nsongs. He was pointed and\npolitical, often labelled\nthe \u201cspokesman of a generation\u201d. Not content to\nbe confined to this niche,\nhowever, Dylan left fans\naghast when his March\n1965 album Bringing It\nAll Back Home included\na side of songs, simultaneously the densest and\nshallowest of his canon,\nbacked by an electric\nband. A few months later\nat Newport folk festival,\nhe arrived on stage\nleather-clad and Stratocaster-adorned, and, with\nthe snap of a snare, immediately launched into\nnew hit \u2018Like A Rolling\nStone\u2019. \u201cHow does it\nfeel?!\u201d he sneered over\nthe boos and jeers, with\na swagger before unseen.\nIt may have turned away\na generation, but it also\ncemented his position in\nmusic history: he was a\nrockstar.\nIf ya say so, computer\nIf OK Computer chronicles humanity\u2019s struggle\nagainst machines, Kid\nA prophecies a dystopia\nwithin which the robots\nwon. With one side of the\nAtlantic launching grunge\nand the other championing\nBritpop, the Radiohead of\nthe mid-nineties was inevitably one of guitar driven\nbelters and ballads. Kid A\nwas a landmark of change.\n\u201cOne of\nthe most\nacclaimed rock\nbands of the\nera releasing a\nfully electronic\nalbum\ncertainly\nshook things\nup a bit\u201d\nA full three years on from\ntheir previous release, it\nushered in the new millennium with synthesisers\nand arpeggiators. Hooks\nwere sparse, soundscapes\nbleak, and not a guitar in\nsight. Nowadays it doesn\u2019t\nseem all that revolutionary \u2013 they kinda made\ninnovation and surprise\ntheir thing, and it\u2019s very\neasy to retrospectively say\nit was an obvious move \u2013\nbut back in 2000, one of\nthe most acclaimed rock\nbands of the era releasing\na fully electronic album\ncertainly shook things up\na bit. Swathes of adoring\nfans renounced them, but\nit resonated with many\nmore, and the vibrations\nare still felt to this day.\nThe Chameleon King\nAs anybody who\u2019s\nbeen keeping up with\nFelix Music over the past\nyear will know, I can\nrarely go a full article\nwithout mentioning one\nMr. David Robert Jones.\nBut here (for once) it\u2019s\nnot without good reason.\nSpringing from whimsical psychedelic folk in\nthe late sixties, Bowie\nhit the seventies like a\nriff-laden, skin-suited,\nglam-rock train, which\nchugged away for half\na glitter-filled decade.\nThe difference at this\njuncture, however, is that\nBowie didn\u2019t alienate his\nfanbase. He didn\u2019t really\nhave one to alienate. Not\nat this point at least.\nBy the end of 1969,\nhe\u2019d been dismissed as\nsomething of a one-hit\nwonder, his sole outing\nchiefly thanks to the\nBBC\u2019s inclusion of \u2018Space\nOddity\u2019 in their coverage\nof the moon landing. He\nlater found his break as\nthe mullet-sporting Ziggy\nStardust, and the rest is\nhistory. Except it\u2019s not.\nThe persona of Ziggy\nwas killed onstage in\n1973, and by \u201975 Bowie\nhad dropped glam rock\naltogether, switching to\nthe blue-eyed soul sound\nof Young Americans. This\nwas a drastic sidestep\nnot only because of the\nchange of timbre but also\nas it made him one of the\nfirst English pop artists to\nembrace a style that had\nuntil then largely resided\nwithin black America.\nWhether appropriative or\nappreciative is a different\nargument, but either way\nfans and critics were left\ntorn and confused.\nIt wasn\u2019t to last though.\nHis next album, Station\nto Station, saw him fuse\nfunk with krautrock as the\nslicked-back, cocaine-ad-dled Thin White Duke.\nFrom there he began to\nexperiment with art rock,\nelectronic and ambient\nmusic, as part of his Berlin\nTrilogy with longtime\nfriend and collaborator\nBrian Eno.\nI won\u2019t bore you with\nall the details of his subsequent works, but let it\nsuffice to say he hopped\ninto new-romanticism,\nflirted with disco, sported\nsome chart success (his\n\u2018Phil Collins Years\u2019), tried\nhis hand at world music,\nformed a boyband, hit up\nindustrial, drum n bass,\njazz, and much, much\nmore. With each twist,\nsome fans were lost and\nsome gained; the net result\nwasn\u2019t always positive.\nI think to an extent\nevery artist is restless.\nNo one wants to define\nor be defined by a sole\nlook, genre, or rhetoric.\nBut few illustrated that\nirrepressible agitation and\nhunger for change better\nthan David Bowie.\nDylan played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly, and the spiders from Mars // Flickr/Paul Townsend\nKids See Ghosts is a return to form for Kanye West\nOnly a week after the release of Ye, Kanye is back, this time teaming up with Kid Cudi as Kids See Ghosts. While the\nprevious album felt rushed, this newest output is a refined and thoughtful masterpiece.\nT\nhis self-titled\nrelease marks the\nfirst collaboration\nproject from hip\nhop\u2019s biggest contemporary influencers, Kid Cudi\nand KanyeWest, who have\ndubbed themselves Kids\nSee Ghosts. This moniker\nand album title, as well\nas the album art, which\nwas the work of Takashi\nMurakami (who has previously worked with Ye\non Graduation) is perfect\nfor this project. Indeed,\nthey truly encapsulate\nwhat we get from the\nalbum \u2013 something sur-real, colourful, sonically\ncaptivating, psychedelic,\nchild-like, magical; bittersweet in places and eerie\nin others.\nWe are kept in this crazy\nSuper Smash Bros. meets\nAttack on Titan world\nthroughout the project\nwith vocal and production\nmoments that range from\nunavoidably explicit\nto subtle yet effective.\nKanye delivers expressive\nmachine gun imitations complimented by\npowerful drum pounding\non \u2018Feel The Love\u2019. Cudi\ndelivers spiritual, delicate\nwailing on \u2018Reborn\u2019 (I\nshould add, the signature\nCudder moan is more palatable on this album than\nit has been in years). The\npair deliver, with the help\nof Ty Dolla Sign, gigantic\nand layered evaporating\ncries of \u201cI feel freeee\u201d on\nthe aptly titled \u2018Freeee\n(Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\u2019. The\nproduction delivers easy\nto miss whizzing whistles\nand triumphant screams\non \u2018Fire\u2019 and similarly\nsubtle but pretty, high\npitched string shivers on\n\u2018Kids See Ghosts\u2019. We literally hear a childish evil\ncackle mid-way through\n\u20184th\nDimension\u2019. It is\nobvious that a lot of effort\nwas put into maintaining\nthe aesthetic of the album\nand it has certainly paid\noff.\nIn 2016, Kid Cudi and\nKanye both went through\na low point with their\nmental health, with Kid\nCudi checking himself\ninto rehab on account of\ndepression and suicidal\nurges (as explained in\nthe emotional statement\nhe released at the time)\nand Kanye having to\nbring his Saint Pablo tour\nto an early close when\nhe was hospitalised for\npsychosis. Mental health\nhas always been a very\nprominent theme in Kid\nCudi\u2019s music, and Kanye\u2019s\nalbums from 808s and\nHeartbreaks onward have\neach had a fair deal to say\non the matter. Ye, released\nonly a week before this\none, honed in on that\ntheme. However, where\nthat album explored his\nmental health condition in\na fairly rushed and often\nlimited manner, Kids See\nGhosts for the most part\nprovides a more complete,\nfocused and sincere\naccount, coming closer to\nthe standard set by Cudi\u2019s\nMan on the Moon. The\nproject is nevertheless\ndecidedly triumphant and\noptimistic when exploring\nsuch issues which is clear\nfrom the onset with Cudi\u2019s\npowerful and reverberating exclamation of \u201cI can\nstill feel the love\u201d on \u2018Feel\nThe Love\u2019 which the song\nbuilds around. Indeed,\nwhile it is probably Kanye\nwho steered this project\nto stylistic and aesthetic\nexcellence, it is Cudi\nwho keeps the break-down-conquering theme\nof the project potent and\neffective, and in this way\nthe pair complement one\nanother nicely. That is to\nsay, where Kanye\u2019s bars\nand delivery are undeniably flashier and more impressive than Cudi\u2019s, Cudi\ngenerally delivers the\nmore emotive moments\nwith lines such as \u201cI guess\nI\u2019m just sick of running\n/ All this time searching\nhard for something / I can\nhear the angels coming\u201d.\nTrue, it is difficult\nnot to wish for both the\nhigh-quality bars and\nthematic focus from both\nhalves of Kids See Ghosts,\njust to make the album\nslightly more coherent.\nEven the first verse on\nthe album, a Pusha T\nfeature, though fiery and\nbraggadocious, doesn\u2019t\nreally have much to do\nwith Cudi \u201cfeel(ing) the\nlove\u201d. Similarly, Mos\nDef\u2019s spoken-word type\nthing at the end of \u2018Kids\nSee Ghosts\u2019 about \u201ccivilization without society\u201d\n(still not quite sure what\nthat means) seems fairly\nrandom. However, when\nall the aspects of this\nalbum come together, it\nmakes for near flawless\nsongs. \u20184th\nDimension\u2019\nis one of these \u2013 a 30s\nChristmas song is sampled\ningeniously as Kanye\ndelivers a crude \u2018Hell Of\nA Life\u2019-style verse about\na chaotic hook up which\nhe compares to a \u201cnew\ndimension\u201d. Cudi\u2019s verse\nis similarly dark and suggestive with a confident\ndelivery but he brings his\nverse back down to earth\nwith the lines \u201cTell the\ncougar get up off me, no,\nmy soul ain\u2019t for sale / All\nthe evils in the world, they\nkeeping on me for real\u201d.\n\u2018Reborn\u2019 is a beautiful\nballad of progression and\nself-improvement, my favourite song of the album.\nCudi sings a heartfelt\nchorus of \u201cI\u2019m so \u2013 I\u2019m\nso reborn, I\u2019m movin\u2019\nforward\u2026 /Ain\u2019t no stress\non me Lord, I\u2019m movin\u2019\nforward\u201d over a calming,\nangelic beat comprising\nof simple keys, progressive drums, glimmering\nsynths, and the aforementioned remedial moans.\nBoth Kanye and Kid Cudi\ndeliver their most personal\nand intimate verses of\nthe album. \u201cI was off the\nmeds, I was called insane\n/ What a awesome thing,\nengulfed in shame / I want\nall the rain, I want all the\npain\u201d Kanye raps, laying\nhimself bare and admitting that the pain in his\nlife has become numbing\nto the point of addictive\n(a sentiment particularly\nechoed on both parts of\n\u2018Ghost Town\u2019). Cudi\u2019s\nverse is just as emotional,\nthough he makes sure\nto remind us \u201cpeace is\nsomething that starts with\nme\u201d. The song ends with\na gorgeous beat switch up\nas the chorus comes back\nin over soothing synths\nand close drums.\nIt would be amiss for\nme not to mention \u2018Cudi\nMontage\u2019, the last track on\nthe album. A Kurt Cobain\nsample and a fast-paced\nCudi flow guides the track\nforward as the beat builds\nfor a grand chorus. The\nbeat then strips back down\nto the sample for what\nis surely Kanye\u2019s most\nconscious verse in a very\nlong time. He raps about\nthe cycle of violence seen\nin impoverished neighbourhoods in America\nand the routine loss of\nmen to imprisonment\nin such environments. I\nwonder what his buddy\nTrump thinks. The song\nends with a majestic outro\nas Mr. Hudson, Kid Cudi\nand Kanye\u2019s vocals blend\ntogether. \u201cLord shine your\nlight on me, save me,\nplease\u201d Kanye implores.\nI do hope Kid Cudi and\nKanye West are \u201csaved\u201d\nfrom their spiritual and\nmental suffering. One\nthing that clearly needs\nno saving though is their\nability to make music.\nHere\u2019s to hoping Kids See\nGhosts is not a one-time\nstint.\nScary Monsters and Lil Peeps // G.O.O.D.

Arts\nWriter Maria Zagorulko takes you through some key movements to look out for.\nARTS\nMaria Zagorulko\nArts Writer\nT\nhe number of\nart styles is\nenormous, if not\ninfinite. With\nexams over, it might be\ntime to undertake some\ncultural education and\nexplore at least a few. The\nfollowing chronological\nguide explains the most\nprofound and impactful\nart streams found in\nLondon\u2019s numerous\ngalleries.\nGothic\nThe characteristic style\nof the 12th\n-15th\ncentury\nfeatures metaphorical representations of medieval\nreality. The Gothic style\nis famous for its portraits\nwith straight, distinct lines\nand simplistic background\nthemes. Most Gothic\npaintings tend to represent\nhistorical or religious\nfigures and events in two\ndimensions with a blue-black colour scheme. At\ntimes, Gothic art lacks\nhappiness and placidity,\nwhich links back to\ndistress within European\nsociety during that period.\nWhere to see the style\nin London: Palace of\nWestminster, Robert\nLewis Roumieu building\nat 33-35 Eastcheap (both\nGothic Revival)\nRenaissance\nAs the time went by,\nreligious and mythological motives continued\nto captivate the minds of\nEuropean artists of the\n14th\n-16th\ncentury. They\nstarted to explore colour\nand shape through images\nof Christ and Madonna\nin natural settings. One\ncan distinguish Renaissance paintings by the\ndominance of light and\na largely romanticised\ncolour palette, loved and\ncherished by Raphael,\nTitian, and Michelangelo \u2013 pioneers of this art\nmovement.\nWhere to see the style\nin London: Bacchus and\nAriadne \u2013 Titian; Saint\nCatherine of Alexandria\n\u2013 Raphael; both at the\nNational Gallery\nBaroque\nThis extravagant art\nstream began to dominate\nart workshops during 17th\n-18th\ncenturies. The exact\ntranslation of barocco\nis \u2018a pearl of non-ideal\nform\u2019. Society of that\nperiod saw excellence\nin exaggerated luxury\nof textures, forms and\ncolours. Baroque paintings have an extremely\ndynamic character, over-filled with emotions and\nlight. Artists of that time\nlike Caravaggio, Rubens,\nand Vel\u00e1squez represented\nthe world through hyper-bolic, large-scale shapes\nshowing the magnificence\nof nature using generous\nbrush strokes and colours\nlike red, lead tin yellow,\nand beige.\nWhere to see the style\nin London: Samson and\nDelilah \u2013 Peter Paul\nRubens; The Toilet of\nVenus \u2013 Diego Vel\u00e1squez;\nboth at the National\nGallery\nClassicism\nThe art world of the\n17th\n-18th\ncentury soon\nshifted from the pompous\nbaroque towards more\nrealistic styles like\nClassicism. Architects,\nsculptors, and artists drew\ntheir attention to rational\nharmony between colour\nand form, striving to\nmake their pieces immac-ulate. They saw beauty\nin linearity, symmetry,\nand a restrained colour\npalette full of undertones.\nIf you walk into a gallery\nand see a piece looking\nlike it was made by an\nA* student, then you are\nprobably standing in front\nof a beautiful example of\nClassicism. Some \u2018A*\nstudents\u2019 of that art era\nwere: Nicolas Poussin,\nCharles le Brun, and Karl\nBryullov.\nWhere to see the style\nin London: A Bacchanalian Revel before a\nTerm \u2013 Nicolas Poussin\nat the National Gallery;\nRegency Classicism\nsection at V&A\nRealism\nRealism as an art\nmovement stems from\nthe 19th\ncentury, resulting\nin its collection being\nthe largest in the world.\nA characteristic property\nof the movement was the\nreflection of critical social\nand economic issues\nwhere the artist often\nconveys their opinion,\ngiving an appraisal on\nthe topic. Hence in the\nspotlight are often scenes\nfrom life of the working\nclass both in towns and\nthe countryside. This led\nto the use of dark, earthy\npalettes.\nWhere to see the style\nin London: The execution\nof Maximilian \u2013 Edouard\nManet; Still Life with\nApples and a Pomegranate \u2013 Gustave Courbet;\nboth at the National\nGallery\nImpressionism\nBorn in 1860s France,\nImpressionism was\nconsidered a complete\ncontrast to Realism.\nInstead of expressing all\ndetails of the surrounding\nworld, as done by Realists,\nImpressionists like Degas,\nRenoir, and Monet were\nkeen to embody the real\nworld through generating emotion within\nthe observer. This was\nachieved by using soft\nyet visible brush strokes\nthat gave a feeling of\ntenderness and calmness.\nThis dreamy art style\ncaptures the effects of\nlight by manipulating\npalettes that include pure,\nintense colours like blue,\nwhite, and red. To enjoy\nImpressionist pieces, one\nsimply needs to find the\nmost romantic and hazy\nart section in the gallery.\nWhere to see the style\nin London: Water-Lilies\n\u2013 Claude Monet at the\nTate Modern; The Skiff \u2013\nPierre-Auguste Renoir at\nthe National Gallery\nModern\nSignificant historical\nevents in 20th\ncentury\npromoted a rapid change\nof values in society\ncausing art workshops\nto produce pieces that\ndisplayed a unique aura.\nArtists moved on from\nusual eclecticism and\nbegan to explore dreams,\nsymbolism, and subjective experiences. The\ncharacteristic modernist\napproach is full of floral\nornaments, asymmetrical\nforms, and complex\ndecorations. A modern\ncolour palette included\nall parts of the colour\nspectrum and was used\nby famous modernists\nsuch as Paul Gauguin,\nGustav Klimt, and Edvard\nMunch. As time went by,\nthe Modern style diverged\ninto Cubism, Fauvism,\nFuturism, and Surrealism\nwhich appealed to wider\naudiences and are considered separate art movements within themselves.\nWhere to see the style\nin London: Faa Iheihe\n\u2013 Paul Gauguin at the\nNational Gallery; Frida\nKahlo: Making Her Self\nUp exhibition at V&A\nFrom Titian to Renoir \u2013 spot the difference // CC\nFrida Kahlo: making an icon into a caricature?\nA new exhibition at the V&A promises to reveal an intimate side to the artist. While her self-portraits and\nphotographs prove revealing, Arts Writer Simran Kukran argues that the exhibition as a whole leaves a lot to be\ndesired.\nF\nrida Kahlo\u2019s is\na feminist icon.\nHer eyebrows,\njewellery, and\nclothes are distinctly\nrecognisable through her\nself-portraits, and Kahlo\nis revered for challenging\ngender norms and rejecting colonial influences as\na proud Mexican commu-nist. This is the first time\nthe artwork, medication,\nclothing,andotherperson-al belongings have been\ndisplayed outside of her\nhome on the outskirts of\nMexico City, now known\nas the Museum of Frida\nKahlo. At the time of her\ndeath, Kahlo instructed\nher husband to seal off her\nbathroom. Only in 2004\nwere its contents revealed.\nMost of the contents of\nthis exhibition were found\nin this way. The V&A\nexhibition was curated\nin partnership with the\nMuseum and Frida Kahlo\nFoundation. It has been\nadvertised as \u201cintimate\u201d,\nseeking to sensitively\ndisplay another side of the\nartist, but crosses the line\ninto blunt and invasive.\nThe focus does not seem\nto be on Kahlo\u2019s artwork,\nbut instead on her clothing\nand belongings.\nThe exhibition addresses Kahlo\u2019s entire\nlife. In the first room\n\u201cIt is striking\nto see actual\nphotographs\nof Kahlo\nalongside her\nself-portraits\u201d\nthere are photographs of\nKahlo as a young girl,\nfollowed by her earliest\nworks. It is striking to\nsee actual photographs\nof Kahlo alongside her\nself-portraits. Although\nclearly recognisable,\nin her self-portraits her\nfeatures look stronger\n\u2013 harsh and more mas-culine, with prominent\nfacial hair. In photographs\nher face shape is softer\nand, while the unibrow\nis strong, facial hair is\nbarely visible. Aside from\nbeing beautiful works\nin their own right, the\nphotographs contextualise\nthe artworks aiding inter-pretation. The balance is\nskewed, however, and it\nfeels the powerful artwork\nthat should be taking\ncentre stage is stuck in the\nbackground.\nKahlo suffered from\npolio as a child, and a\ntraffic accident at 18 left\nher disabled with chronic\npain.Although she aspired\nto be a doctor, she never\nfully recovered and did\nnot return to education.\nShe began painting while\nbedridden. The details of\nher health issues were kept\nprivate, but her pain and\ndisability was explored\nregularly in her artwork,\nmost famously in The\nBroken Column (1944).\nThere is only a small\nphoto of the work visible,\nbut Kahlo\u2019s prosthetic leg\nsits in a large mirrored\ncase in the middle of a\ndimly lit room with eerie\nmusic playing. This feels\nsensationalist, almost\nperverse. It is as if her\npain is being fetishized.\nHer orthopaedic corsets\nare also on display. The\nfact that Kahlo decorated,\nalmost graffitied, these\nmeans their display as\nworks of art is less un-comfortable. Particularly\nmoving is a foetus painted\nonto the corset following\na termination for health\nreasons. Her medication\nis displayed alongside\nletters appealing for\ndoctor\u2019s appointments.\nWhile her disability was\nan important part of\nKahlo\u2019s identity, it was\nexplored in her own terms\nin her artwork; to force\nthis level of exposure\nseems insensitive.\nKahlo was a proud\ncommunist and Mexican\npatriot, even changing her\nbirthyear of 1907 to 1910,\nthat of the Mexican Revolution. Her passion was\nreflected in her clothing;\nshe wore pre-colonial\ntraditional Mexican dress\nto make an empowered\nstatement. There are\nphotos of her family\nmembers wearing similar\nclothing, and she was\nproud of her matriarchal\nheritage. The clothing has\nbeen beautifully restored\nand displayed. Captions\nproudly highlight the fact\nthe clothing\u2019s cigarette\nburns and mending after\nwear and tear mean it\nwas well loved \u2013 \u201cher\nwardrobe was not staged\nbut a second skin\u201d \u2013 but is\nthis really so surprising?\nKahlo is an icon, yes \u2013 but\nshe is not just a character\nfor a Halloween costume.\nIs it so shocking her\nclothes were worn and\nlived-in?\nKahlo\u2019s makeup is\nalso displayed, with some\nkohl used to darken her\ndistinctive eyebrows still\nin its original packaging.\nThe curator notes Kahlo\n\u201cconstructed\u201d her identity\nthough her belongings\nbut, however beautiful,\nthey do not give nearly a\nfraction of the insight her\nexpressive paintings do.\nPerhaps her clothing\nand belongings have a\ndifferent feel displayed\nin her Mexico City home,\nbut something in the V&A\nfeels uncomfortable and\ndoesn\u2019t sit quite right.\nLeaving the exhibition\ncontinues in this vein \u2013\ngiftshop tote bags and\nfridge magnets are decorated with her image, and\nyou can purchase floral\nheaddresses inspired by\nher look. There is also\nMexican hot sauce on\nthe shelves. It is unclear\nwhat the purpose of\nthis is, but whatever the\npurpose, it does not seem\nto have been achieved.\nOut in the garden there\nis a very Instagrammable\nwire sculpture topped\nwith flowers, with a\nhashtag competition to\nwin a frozen margarita.\nThe exhibition sought to\nreveal Kahlo\u2019s identity in\nan intimate way, but the\nresult is more like cari-cature. While the style of\ndelivery is not special, the\nexhibition is worth going\nto see for Kahlo\u2019s extraordinary paintings alone.\nFrida Kahlo with Olmec figurine, 1939 // Nickolas Muray Photo Archives\nWhere?

Having\ngrown up in Lancashire,\nEngland, he moved to\nAmerica with his family\nat the age of seventeen,\ndetermined to become a\npainter. Still well-known\nin America, he was highly\npopular at the time, and\nhis awe-inspiring depictions of the American\nwilderness have continued\nto influence succeeding\ngenerations of artists and\nthe public alike.\nEntering the exhibition,\nI can see why his early\nworks were, and still are,\nso admired. Dramatic and\nromantic, Cole\u2019s View\nof the Round-Top in the\nCatskill Mountain places\nus on the top of a mountain\nas we look on towards\nanother mountain, the\nwild and untouched landscape stretching far into\nthe distance. Close to us,\na couple of windswept\nand gnarly trees add to\nthe sense of depth of the\npainting, making the\nmountain and distant river\nfeel far away, as wispy\nclouds make us realise\nhow high up we must\nbe. We are left in awe of\nthis huge mountain; a\nformidable work of nature\nthat feels more permanent\nthan anything humans\ncould build.\nHaving established\nhimself as an artist in\nAmerica, Cole traveled\nto England and Italy\n(1829-1831), where he\nsaw much art which\ninspired him and met with\na number of influential\nartists, including JMW\nTurner. Cole was a fan of\nTurner\u2019s early work, evidenced by his borrowing\nof the dramatic clouds\nin Turner\u2019s Snow Storm\nfor his greatest work The\nCourse of Empire. Being\nlargely self-taught up to\nthis point, he studied fine\narts in Italy, and experimented with new techniques such as that of oil\nsketches, which he took\nwith him back to America\nand shared with other\nartists, in what was to be\nlater dubbed the Hudson\nRiver School movement.\n\u201cEntering the\nexhibition, I\ncan see why\nCole\u2019s early\nworks are still\nso admired\u201d\n\u201cCole watched\nthe landscapes\nhe loved\ntamed to\nmake way\nfor railroads,\nfactories, and\nfarmland\u201d\nAs the exhibition transports us chronologically\nthrough his life and work,\nso too we see pieces by\nthose that inspired him. I\nwas particularly taken by\nHadleigh Castle by Constable, which caught my\nattention just as it caught\nthat of the young Cole.\nThe ruined castle is set in a\nrugged, coastal landscape;\nthe dark colours used for\nthe scenery contrasting\nwith an almost obsessive\narray of white highlights\nacross the entire scene,\ngiving the castle a\nmystical, haunting feel.\nThe painting shows the\ndecline of what was once a\ngreat manmade structure,\nwith nature reclaiming\nthe crumbling building for\nitself. This rise and fall is\none that resonated with\nCole, forming a running\ntheme through much of\nhis work.\nHis greatest series, The\nCourse of an Empire,\ndepicts the rise and fall\nof a civilisation, with\neach scene set in the same\nimaginary location with\nits distinctive mountain\npeak. As time passes we\nsee humans tame the land,\nlater building a grand\nempire, before greed\ncauses the destruction of\nthe city in a cruel war.\nFinally, we watch as\nnature reclaims the landscape for herself, leaving\nus with a last, peaceful\nimage of just civilisation\u2019s\nremnants left behind. With\nprobable influences from\nan imperial London and\nhis visits to ancient ruins\nin Italy, Cole\u2019s series was\nmet with critical success\nand is truly stunning.\nmost iconic paintings, The\nOxbow, contrasts the wilderness and farmed land,\nwhilst River in the Catskills is thought to be the\nfirst landscape painting\nto depict a railroad.\nHaving spent much of\nhis career painting the\nwild landscapes around\nthe Hudson River, Cole\nopposed the destruction of\nthe American wilderness,\nin particular rejecting the\ngovernment\u2019s expansionist plans under President\nAndrew Jackson.\nSadly, though Cole\u2019s\ntechniques and style\nwent on to inspire a next\ngeneration of artists, his\nresponse to society\u2019s\nresponsibility to the environment were largely lost.\nIncreasingly, artists championed industrialisation\nthrough their work, such\nas in Durand\u2019s Progress\n(1853), commissioned\nby a railroad executive.\nHowever, given the recent\ntumultuous changes made\nto environmental policies\nin America, there was\na poignant relevance to\nhis work that I had not\nexpected.\nAs I walked out onto\nTrafalgar Square, I felt an\nunexpected camaraderie\nwith Cole. He too visited\nthe National Gallery, when\nit was just five years old,\nand would have wandered\naround the same rooms.\nHis appreciation for the\nbeauty of nature, and his\nwarnings of the cost of\nunchecked environmental\npolicies on the natural\nworld have gained new\nrelevance as we become\nincreasingly aware of the\neffects of climate change,\nand our impact on the\nplanet. Popular then, and\npopular now \u2013 his work\nwill continue to be appreciated in years to come.\nExhibition organised\nby the National Gallery,\nLondon and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New\nYork.\nThe Course of Empire: The Consummation of Empire, Thomas Cole 1835\u20136 // Collection of The New-York Historical Society,\nNew York / Digital image created by Oppenheimer Editions\nARTS\nHelen Monry-Kyrle\nArts Writer\nWhere?

She\nasks him to meet her at the\nwaterfall, a secluded area\nin the woods, and their\naffair begins. She asks\nhim several times if he\nwould like to change his\nmind, offering him \u2013 and\nherself \u2013 an exit, but he is\nadamant.\nTseng\u2019s writing is\npoetic, using the symbolism of the island the\ntwo inhabit to describe\nMayumi\u2019s feelings\ntowardsherlover.Mayumi\ndoes not shy away from\ndeconstructing this relationship in her endeavours\nto come to terms with\nthis incomprehensible\nattraction; is it his youth,\nher stagnant marriage, or\nthe boy himself?\n\u201cTseng\u2019s\nwriting is\npoetic, using\nthe symbolism\nof the island\nthe two inhabit\nto describe\nMayumi\u2019s\nfeelings\u201d\n\u201cThe novel\ntakes on\nunexplored\nterritories\nin the well-known plot\nof forbidden\nlove\u201d\nFrom the very beginning of their acquaint-ance, one gets a Freudian\nsense to this relationship:\nMayumi feels proud of\nhis legible handwriting\nas he fills the registration\nform for his library card\nlike a mother would for\nher child. \u201cAnd why\ndid I, even then, feel a\ntwinge of pride at that?\u201d\nPainfully conscious of\nthe \u201cpower differential\u201d\nin their relationship, with\nher being older and more\nexperienced meaning\nshe often makes the first\nmove, Mayumi offers him\nmany chances to leave\nbefore it is too late. As\nthe relationship develops,\nhowever, it seems the\nroles are shifting and he\nis acting paternal towards\nher; as he helps her climb\nup to the loft, he in control\nwhile she is looking up to\nhim for instructions like a\nchild. \u201cI looked up at him\nthe way children glance\nat their parents before\nundertaking some new\nchallenge, and, without\nmissing a beat, he winked\nat me fatherlike.\u201d\nThe novel is broken\ndown into four main\nparts, following the four\nseasons. The affair begins\nin the winter, with the\nlong nights offering some\nrefuge to their secret. As\nthe start of summer grows\nnearer, however, Mayumi\nis anxious about what the\nfuture holds; he will soon\ngraduate and start thinking\nof a life beyond the small\nisland. He has his whole\nlife ahead of him, and she\nknows she can\u2019t hold him\nback. In fact, she is excited\nto witness his journey of\ngrowth even if it means\nshe is not a part of it. In\nthat sense, her maternal\ninstincts overpower her\nselfish desires as a lover.\nthe well-known plot of\nforbidden love. Mayumi\u2019s\nfriendship with the boy\u2019s\nmother added another\ndimension to the story.\nHis mother clearly plays a\ndominant role in his life,\nand through their interac-tions, Mayumi can glean\nmore about him than he\nis willing to share. On the\nother hand, Mayumi is\ntormented by her guilt of\n\u201ccorrupting\u201d the woman\u2019s\nson, while maintaining a\nconvincing fa\u00e7ade when\nin her company.\nMayumi never once\nmentions her lover\u2019s\nname; the reason for this\nis gleaned towards the\nfinal pages. In that respect,\nit is similar to Daphne du\nMaurier\u2019s Rebecca, in\nwhich the protagonist is\nnever named: if a character\u2019s most basic form of\nidentity is not known, it\nmakes the reader question\ntheir very existence. At\ntimes, the implications\nof the parental nature of\nthe relationship were too\nheavy-handed; the novel\nwould have benefited\nfrom a more subtle portrayal of the evolution of\nthe relationship and hence\nthe role of the \u2018parent\u2019,\ntrusting in the reader\u2019s\nability to make these\nconnections on their own.\nNevertheless, Tseng\u2019s\nlyrical writing style,\ninteresting take, and twist\non a nearly-exhausted plot\nin this debut novel already\nhas me waiting impatiently for her next work.\nJennifer Tsang\u2019s novel takes place off the coast of New England // Flickr/Jonathan Miske\nBOOKS\nBayan Al-Bulushi\nBooks Writer\nEuropa Editions. 272 pp.\nMAYUMI AND THE SEA\nOF HAPPINESS\nby Jennifer Tseng\nI thoroughly enjoyed\nthis novel.

Melodies meandering\nthrough modes and motifs,\neach refrain serving as\na signifier, a stand-in\nfor human speech \u2013 the\nconnotations built by our\nmusical traditions there to\nhint at some underlying\nmeaning? Is it all just\naesthetic in the solitary\nPlatonic ideal, or is there\na more symbolic point?\nA major challenge\nin assessing music as a\nmedium is the complicated interaction between\nthe literary and the sonic.\nPlain-jane three-chord\nsix-string ballads are just\nas capable of captivating\nus as the most lavishly-or-chestrated instrumental\nepics of classical music,\nor as the deft and dizzying\nmedley of extended\nintervals and enchanting\nimprovisation that constitute jazz. What\u2019s the\nequivalence? After all,\nthis is the music section,\nand at the end of the day\nwe all just shit out some\nrating outta five and go\nhome.\nwe fall in love when it\nconnects. Sure, there\u2019s\naesthetic value to music\n\u2013 it can be pretty, can\u2019t it?\nBut pretty isn\u2019t hook-y.\nWe can enjoy a nice view,\nfeel sated, and move on\nwith our lives. Pretty\ndoesn\u2019t compel us to\ninteract, to come back and\nback again. The works we\nlove always have a certain\ncatharsis \u2013 a foothold to\nidentifying with the song\nor album that transcends\nthe \u2018simple\u2019 sound. Good\nmusic is more than just\ndecoration. It includes an\ninvitation to subsume the\nwork into yourself.\nThis necessitates\nsome kind of symbolic\nexchange. The aforementioned catharsis\nrequires a conveying of\nattitude, emotion, inten-tion, information. You\ndon\u2019t find information\nin random noise, as any\nmathematician will tell\nyou. Musicians cultivate\nvocabularies, identifying\nthemselves with traditions spanning hundreds\nof years. Minor modes\nsound sad. Going down a\nfifth sounds like coming\nhome. There\u2019s that phrase\nyou remember from the\nsong on the radio when\nyou realized you lost\nyour teddy bear seventeen\nyears ago, and now it\nsounds like loss. Nuance\nis conveyed in every\naspect of performance \u2013\nin picking dynamics, in\nharmony, in the way the\nband coheres.\nOrthogonally, we have\nlyrics \u2013 perhaps the most\ndirect means of communicating intent, but which\nthemselves can dissolve\ninto a wonderfully abstract\nsea of connotations and\nreverberant feeling. To an\nearlier point, this is why\nrusty strings and off-kilter\nstrumming can sound so\nwonderful; sometimes\nthey just fit a voice, and\ntechnicality gives way to\nthe rawness of emotion\notherwise conveyed. And\nin this movement, ballads\nand jazz fall on equal\nfooting. Different tradi-tions, different customs,\nto be sure, but the same\nlatent wish to be read into.\nThe Western music tradition is a fecund source\nof unspecific meaning. We\ninterpret lines as sounding\nbright, dour, space-y, connections formed by years\nof listening, interacting,\nplaying, writing, talking,\nthinking. Beauty truly is\nin the eye of the beholder;\nart is elevated by the\nprocess of interpretation\nas much as it is in its very\ncreation \u2013 whether it be a\nramble in a uni paper or a\nslick reharm by a talented\nartist. It is the very attempt\nto interpret a piece of\nwork\u2019s meaning that gives\nthat work meaning, a sort\nof Deleuzo-Guattarian\nreterritorialization-recon-textualization of intent\nthat feeds back into a\nrich cultural dialogue and\nmoves the music world\nforward.\nAnd so, I beg of\nyou \u2013 don\u2019t just listen to\nmusic. Talk about music.\nThink about music. Argue\nabout music. Participate\nin music. There are few\npleasures in life so rich.\nI\u2019d like to close this\npiece off \u2013 and this year\noff \u2013 by thanking Adrian\nand Andy for an amazing\njob editing the section,\nFred for being a legendary\nEditor-in-Chief, our contributors for their dedication and their wonderful\nopinions on all things\nsonic, the copy editors\nfor their much-needed\nand little-appreciated\nwork behind the scenes,\nand, generally, everyone\nat Felix for a fantastic\nfucking year.\nAh, and you, dear\nreader.

Implicit within\nthis act is the notion of\nviolence, of power, of\nhorror. Mexican author\nCristina Rivera Garza\nexpertly mines this deep\nseam of the uncanny in\nher short novel The Iliac\nCrest, first published in\nSpanish in 2002, and now\narriving in English with\na translation by Sarah\nBooker. Drawing on\nthe boundaries between\nexistence and absence,\ngender lines, and the\nfluid nature of borders,\nRivera Garza has weaved\na darkly-unsettling tale,\nwhich \u2013 though short \u2013\nleaves a lasting impact on\nthe reader.\n\u201cRivera Garza\nhas weaved\na darkly-unsettling tale,\nwhich leaves a\nlasting impact\non the reader\u201d\n\u201cNot only the\nterrain of the\nearth, but\nthe terrain\nof the body\nalso proves\nmalleable\u201d\nThe book centres on an\nunnamed narrator, living\nin a home by the sea, who\nworks at a hospital for the\ndying, which he describes\nas \u201cnothing more than\na cemetery with open\ntombs.\u201d One rainy night\nhe receives a visit from\ntwo women: one is a\nfigure from his past, struck\ndown by a fever, while the\nother is Mexican author\nAmparo D\u00e1villa, known\nfor her gothic works which\ndwell on the fantastic and\nsinister. This D\u00e1villa has\nbeen \u2018disappeared\u2019 \u2013 the\nreal-life D\u00e1villa is alive\nand well \u2013 which Rivera\nGarza describes as a form\nof physical contagion\nsweeping the unnamed\ncountry: \u201cmechanisms\ntriggering the disease vary\nquite a bit \u2013 a greater or\nlesser degree of violence,\nmore or less isolation, a\nlittle or a lot of silence \u2013\nbut the common element\namong all of them is\ncontact.\u201d\nThisideaofbeingdisappeared has a long history,\nparticularly in Latin and\nSouthern America, where\nregimes like Pinochet\u2019s\nwould regularly liquidate\npolitical opponents.\nWhile at the time of\nwriting Rivera Garza was\nundoubtedly referencing\nthe widely-publicised\nfemicides occurring in\nCiudad Ju\u00e1rez, today they\nevoke most strongly incidents like the 2014 Iguala\nmass kidnapping, during\nwhich 43 students were\ndisappeared.\nThe disappeared\nD\u00e1villa nurses the other\nwoman back to health, and\nthe two begin conspiring\ntogether in an unknown\nlanguage, leaving the\nnarrator helpless \u2013 \u201cI\ncould do nothing before\ntheir language. I could not\ninfiltrate it.\u201d They ask him\nto search the hospital\u2019s\nrecords for a mysterious\npatient from the past,\nwhich could help them\nidentify a lost manuscript\nof D\u00e1villa\u2019s.\nRivera Garza evokes\na sense of Kafkaesque\nnightmare in the hospital\nsequences, while also\nreminding me of the cool,\nclear horror of Shirley\nJackson\u2019s best work.\nWhat sets Rivera\nGarza\u2019s novel apart from\nother books which deal\nwith similar moods of\nisolation and fear is the\nway she explores the\nidea of boundaries. The\nbook takes place in an\nuncertain geography \u2013\nreferences are made to a\n\u2018North City\u2019 and a \u2018South\nCity\u2019, between which\nthe hospital seems to be\nlocated, abutting a wide\nopen sea. The narrator\ndescribes it as \u201cthe end of\nthe world\u2026this threshold\nwhere one state ended\nand the next was unable\nto begin.\u201d The terrain of\nthe earth is not the only\nuncertain aspect; the\nterrain of the body, and\nof gender, also proves to\nbe malleable, with Rivera\nGarza exploring ambiguities in identity skillfully,\nalthough certain linguistic\ndifferences between\nSpanish and English\nlimit this exploration\nsomewhat. Those who\nare disappeared live \u201cwith\none foot in the grave and\nthe other on terrain that\nheld only a remote resemblance to life\u201d, existing\nin some kind of ethereal\nplane.\nRivera Garza also\npowerfully writes about\nthe force language, and its\ncreation, can have. Faced\nhave the means to describe\ntheir own experiences on\nthis earth.\u201d The word, for\nRivera Garza, is both a\nliberation and a form of\npower, which can both lift\nup and oppress.\nLate in the novel,\nthe narrator speaks of\nhow staff at the hospital\ndescribe dying individuals\nas \u2018patients\u2019: \u201cWe dealt\nwith people to whom we\nhadn\u2019t yet found a sufficiently technical or neutral\nway to describe, without\nthe weight of conscience,\nthe underlying truth about\nour position: we were\nnot doctors, but more or\nless efficient guardians\nof death.\u201d This sense of\nhorror lurking behind\nlanguage infiltrates The\nIliac Crest; it pervades\ndeep into the bones of\nRivera Garza\u2019s words,\nsettling deep into the very\nmarrow of the novel.\nCrosses marking the site where the corpses of eight women were found in Ciudad\nJu\u00e1rez in 1996 // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nAnd Other Stories. 136 pp.\nTHE ILIAC CREST\nby Cristina Rivera Garza\nwith his interlocutors\u2019\nunfamiliar speech, the\nnarrator ends up feeling\n\u201cas if I were inside a\nparenthesis in a sentence\nwritten in an unknown\nlanguage.\u201d The manuscript of D\u00e1villa\u2019s must\nbe found otherwise her\n\u201cyoung followers won\u2019t\n\n"

We\nhave a way to go yet, but\nthe culture at our university is starting to shift, and\na look back over the last\nyear suggests progress is\nbeing made.\nBeginning with the\nelephant in the room: it\u2019s\neasy to overlook the fact\nthat this year a strike at\nImperial College actually\nachieved something, with\nuniversity management\nat Imperial and across\nthe country being forced\nto concede on proposed\nchanges to staff pensions.\nStudent involvement bolstered this, with students\nstanding on the picket\nlines, and over a hundred\nattending events in solidarity at the start and end\nof the action.\nCertain \u2018progressive\u2019\ngroups on campus, such\nas the Labour Society\nand IQ, enjoyed record\nhigh membership this\nyear. Divest Imperial, the\ncampaign to get College\nto take its money out of\ntoxic investments in fossil\nfuel, and the Left Forum,\na non-partisan political/\ncampaign group, also\nenjoyed high engagement this year. Some of\nthese groups are coming\ntogether to form a united\n\u2018Action at Imperial,\u2019 with\nthe goal of making our\nuniversity a slightly better\nplace.\nThere are even positives\nIn spite of the surprise\naddition of the Wellbeing\nRepresentation Network\nthis year, rep engagement\nacross the university has\nbeen relatively high, with\nreps campaigning for\nbetter personal tutoring,\na stronger counselling\nservice, and agreeing with\nstaff on how the curriculum review (in which all\nthe content in every course\nis up for change) will take\nplace. Meanwhile the\nliberation officers\u2019 work\nthis year has included\na campaign for gender\nneutral bathrooms, organising a talk by Akala,\nwork on neurodivergence,\nimproving accessibility\nin Ethos, and fighting to\nimprove the College\u2019s\nbursary provision. Union\nCouncil, the Union\u2019s chief\ndecision-making body,\nhas also been largely\nwell attended this year,\nand while the contentious\nand often tedious nature\nof these meetings can be\noff-putting, they are a\nvast improvement from\nthe empty rooms and low\nattendance which plagued\npast years.\nIn all of these cases,\nFelix itself played a\nsignificant role, thanks in\nlarge part to the editorial\nteam. Liberation officers\nhave had regular columns,\ngiving them a platform to\ndiscuss the oft-overlooked\nbut important issues faced\nby the groups they rep-resent. During the UCU\ndispute, it was easier to\nfind news in Felix than the\nnational press. Lastly and\nperhaps most importantly,\nFelix has challenged both\nthe Union and College\nthis year. Regarding the\nformer, Felix has detailed\nthe poor handling of\ncertain sensitive issues,\nand more generally has\ndone a good job reporting\non the decisions being\nmade in our name and\non our behalf in Beit. On\nthe latter, articles have\ndetailed the university\u2019s\nvast assets, the significant\npay and Brobdingnagian\nexpenses of senior university management, and\ninequality at Imperial.\nAll of this suggests that\nthe mood at Imperial is\nshifting, but there\u2019s still\nmore to be done. First of\nall, those of us who feel\nthese improvements are\nimportant must work to\nensure what we have isn\u2019t\nlost \u2013 that this year won\u2019t\njust have been a flash in\nthe pan. That means we\nhave to actively engage in\nrepresentation, liberation,\nand a student newspaper\nto cover it all: supporting\nthings from the sidelines\nisn\u2019t enough. More am-bitiously, it means using\nthis year as a foundation\n\u2013 channelling what we\u2019ve\nachieved into productively\nchallenging the university\nand refusing to accept at\nface value what we\u2019re told.\nDoes a university who\npays its \u201ckey management\npersonnel\u201d almost \u00a3300k\neach, with more than\n\u00a3100m in surplus need to\ncut staff salaries (in real\nterms) or the SCR breakfast (in very real terms)\nto save money? Should\nthese \u201cKMPs\u201d be foisting\nwide scale changes to the\ndegree courses on reluctant academics? When\none quarter of all the\nundergraduate students\nsign something, is it unreasonable to expect some\nkind of formal response?\nIs it acceptable that for\nyears, some departments\nhaven\u2019t had so much as\na common room? Should\nthe foremost British\nScience and Technology\ninstitute invest its money\nin arms, cigarettes, and\nfossil fuels? As students,\nwe have a responsibility\nto ask these questions\n\u2013 we shouldn\u2019t just be\nspectators: there would be\nno university without us.\nImperial might look the same, but change is happening // Imperial College\n\u201cWe must\nengage in\nrepresentation\nliberation\nand a student\nnewspaper to\ncover it all\u201d\nThings will only\nchange if people who care\ndo something about it.

As my ideology\ncould not be further from\nthat description, I would\nlike to address the claims\nspouted in the response, if\nonly to stop a mischarac-terisation of my position\nby what seems an obvious\nattempt of whitewashing\nthe atrocities of the Syrian\ngovernment.\nFour accusations are\ncharged against the SDF.\nEach of them would be\nterrible on their own:\nthe use of child female\nsoldiers under the influence of drugs; dressing\ntheir militiamen as civil-ians; preventing civilians\nfrom leaving battle zones;\nand supporting attacks in\nEurope. The piece even\ncompares them to ISIS,\nwhich, in my opinion, is\nan affirmation that can\nonly be made from either\nignorance or malice.\nOn child soldiers,\nthe source provided is a\nYouTube video hosted by\na channel owned by the\nAl-Hamza Division. This\nis a Turkish-backed militia\nthat forms part of the wide\narray of forces Turkey has\nbeen using in Rojava to\nwrestle control back from\nthe SDF and its allies. If\nthere were a group that\nwould like to portray the\nSDF as a tyrannical force,\nit would be them, so we\nshould consider the possibility the video provided\nhas been staged, as has\nbeen the case of many\nfootage pieces during\nthe war. Nevertheless,\nthere is indeed a report\nby Human Rights Watch\nthat denounces the use of\nchild soldiers by the YPG,\nthe backbone of the SDF.\nWhile very concerning,\nthe report also mentions\nthese incidents are far\nfrom common in the\nYPG and admits a tenet\npolicy of the organisation\nis refusing to use child\nsoldiers. In addition, it\nshould be noted that as\nrecent as 2014, ISIS was\nengaging into a genocidal\ncampaign against the\nKurds, so, terrible as it\nis, some teenagers were\nforced to fight to save their\nlives. The cases reported\nhappened under units that\nwere not under the central\ncontrol of the YPG, and\nthe organisation promised\nto investigate the matter,\nreiterating their commitment to universal human\nrights. They also ask for\nexternal support in their\nmission to maintain basic\ncivil standards in both the\nwar front and the areas\nwhere their control is\ntenuous. In this, the YPG\nhave done more to tackle\nthe problem of child\nsoldiers in Syria than\nany of the other warring\nparties, which have also\nbeen accused of using\nunderage individuals in\ntheir armies.\nThe second claim is\nthat the SDF dresses\ntheir combatants with\ncivilian clothes, which, as\nexplained in the article,\ngoes against Article 48 of\nthe Geneva Conventions,\nblurring the line between\ncivilians and soldiers. I\nhave only been able to\nfind a single instance of\nthis happening \u2013 precisely\nin the video provided by\nthe writer. I assume the\nSDF does not encourage\nits forces to use civilian\nclothes, but probably in\nthe chaos of the war some\nunits, or even individual\nsoldiers, have retorted to\nthis tactic to escape the\nenemy\u2019s fire. Not that\nit matters: according to\nAmnesty International,\nthe Turkish army has\nindiscriminately fired at\ncivilians fleeing Afrin,\nkilling up to 17 children\nin just a single incident.\nThus, it seems that sadly\nArticle 48 is rendered\nmoot by the cruelty of\nErdogan.\nThe piece also claims\nthe SDF have been\nblocking civilians from\nleavingAfrin. The spokesman for the UN Secretary\nGeneral is the source for\nthis claim, as it is shown\nin the video linked by\nthe author. However, the\nvery spokesman admits\nthe UN has not been able\nto contact the local authorities of Afrin, which\nimplies that their source\nof information is Turkey,\nas no other parties where\nfighting in the area. The\nstory was only reported\nby organisms like the\nAnadolu Agency, the\npropaganda arm of the\nTurkish government. I\nwould like to see more\nsolid evidence.\nFinally, it is claimed\nErdogan-critical regional\nMP of the leftist party\nDie Linke was recently\nhit in the head and called\na \u2018traitor\u2019 in Turkish by\nan unknown man. Across\nthe Atlantic, supporters\nof Erdogan became\ninfamous when they beat\nup protesters during the\nlast visit of the Turkish\ndictator to Washington\nD.C.\nGeology students are as satisfied as Sade // Wikimedia\n\u201cComparing\nthe SDF to ISIS\ncan only come\nfrom either\nignorance or\nmalice\u201d\nthe SDF advocate terrorist\nacts against civilians in\nEurope. According to the\nnews that is taken as an\nevidence for this claim,\na Kurdish group based in\nthe diaspora, the Apoist\nYouth Initiative, called for\nviolence against assets of\nthe Turkish government,\nas well as the parties and\norganisations that, according to them, enable the\nviolations of human rights\ncarried out by the present\nTurkish government (i. e.\nmost European govern-ments). The group follows\nAbd\u00fcllah \u00d6calan, the\nlong-time jailed founder\nof the wide Kurdish leftist\nmovement, but apart from\nboth taking inspiration\nfrom him, no links have\nbeen found between the\nAYI and the SDF forces\nfighting in Syria. I want\nto state that I absolutely\ncondemn the actions of\nthis group against civilians and institutions of\nTurkish origin, that have\nno blame whatsoever for\nthe foreign policy of their\ncountry. Nonetheless,\nKurdish led groups are not\nthe only ones increasing\nthe tension among the\ndiasporas. In Germany, an\nBelieving that we\nshould not intervene\nmilitarily in Syria is a\ncompletely legitimate\nposition, one I happen to\nhold. However, I will not\naccept falsehoods directed\nagainst the only group that\nis showing some commitment to democracy,\ntolerance of minorities,\nand feminism. While I\nagree past intervention in\nLybia and Iraq has been\na colossal disaster, that\ndoes not mean we have\nto diplomatically support\neither the criminal Syrian\ngovernment (which has\nbeen known to use gas\nagainst its own citizens)\nor the Islamist controlled\nopposition (whose record\nwith human rights is\nshaky at best). That is\nwhy I believe the best-case scenario for Syria is\na SDF-led government.\nBecause being against\nWestern imperialism does\nnot mean blindly supporting the worst satraps of\nthe Middle East.\n\n"

Read on to find out why you should visit the tourist-beloved Italian gems Verona and Venice.\nI\ntaly is a perfect choice\nfor your summer\nvacation since it has\neverything \u2013 from\nbig famous cities to quiet\nlesser-known villages and\nbeach towns. You can pop\nin for a quick weekend\ngetaway or spend a few\nweeks touring all around\nthe country, whatever\nfloats your boat. It\u2019s also\neasy to score affordable\nflight tickets (although\nmostly during the off\nseason), and the warm\nMediterranean climate\nwill not disappoint. Last\nyear, I went on a three-day\ntrip to Verona and Venice,\ntwo of the most popular\nItalian cities loved by\ncouples and solo travellers\nalike, and rightly so.\nScusi, we\u2019re going to Italy: a trip to Verona & Venice\nVerona\nMost of us know\nVerona as the hometown\nof Romeo and Juliet,\nprotagonists of the tragic\nlove story by Shakespeare. Naturally, one of\nthe main attractions there\nis Juliet\u2019s balcony at the\nCasa di Giulietta (Juliet\u2019s\nhouse). You can pay to\ngo up there but you can\nalso admire it from the\noutside at no cost. The\nnearby souvenir shop sells\nlove padlocks, and there\u2019s\na wall you can leave a\nmessage on. There\u2019s also\nRomeo\u2019s house, but it\u2019s\nsimply private property\nwith nothing touristy.\nFor \u20ac5 you can climb\nup the Torre dei Lamberti,\na tower that overlooks the\nwhole city, unravelling a\nsea of cute red-roof houses\nsurrounded by mountains.\nIt truly looks spectacular\nand is worth the heavy\nEdita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor\nTRAVEL\nclimb! If you want to see\nthe panorama for free, you\ncan opt for climbing a hill\ninstead.\nAnother famous attraction is Castelvecchio,\na medieval castle (now\nmuseum), and a bridge of\nthe same name. They both\noffer amazing views of\nthe Adige River, with the\ncity and mountains in the\ndistance. There\u2019s also a\ncoliseum in the city \u2013 not\nas majestic as the one in\nRome but still very beau-tiful.\nOverall, less than a day\nwas enough to see the\nmain objects in the city so\nI set off to Venice in the\nlate afternoon and visited\nPadua on the way. This\ncity has several beautiful\nchurches and cathedrals\nbut since I arrived quite\nlate, I just had a lovely\nwalk around and treated\nmyself to some Italian\nfood.\nVenice\nLet me start this off by\nsaying that Venice is really\nexpensive so if you\u2019re\nnot keen on spending too\nmuch, you should plan\nyour visit well. The city\ncentre with all the canals\nand tourist attractions\nis in the island that you\ncan easily reach by bus\nor train from mainland\nVenice, where accommodation is much cheaper.\nThe restaurant prices are\nobviously very high, and\nthe service charge is mandatory everywhere but\nthere\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s and\na couple of grocery stores\non the island. Public bathrooms are all paid, except\none cheeky loo at the top\nof a supermarket near\nthe Rialto Bridge. This\nsupermarket also has a\nfree viewpoint if you want\nto see the mesmerising\npanorama of the city.\nOK, now on to the\nexciting part! The best\nway to experience Venice\nis to wander around on its\nnarrow streets, without\nany plan really, and see\nwhere it takes you. You\ncan easily take a random\nturn that will instantly\nlead you away from the\nColour-popping houses in Burano Island: every photo is a postcard! // Edita Pileckyte\nCastelvecchio Bridge in Verona, one of, but not the only, prides of the city // Edita\nPileckyte\n\u201cTorre dei\nLamberti is\na tower that\noverlooks the\nwhole city\nof Verona,\nunravelling a\nsea of cute red-roof houses\nsurrounded\nby mountains.\nIt truly looks\nspectacular\nand is worth\nthe heavy\nclimb!\u201d\n\u201cThe best way\nto experience\nVenice is\nto wander\naround on its\nnarrow streets,\nwithout any\nplan really,\nand see where\nit takes you\u201d\nFancy looking, yet not so delicious breakfast served on board // Noppasit Pongsak\nMost of us travel by plane at least once a year but have you ever wondered what it\u2019s like to fly First Class? Travel\nWriterNoppasitPongsakshareshisfirst-handexperienceasaFirstClasscustomerofThaiAirwaysanddiscusses\nwhether it\u2019s really worth the money.\nFlying First Class: is it worth the hype?\nNoppasit Pongsak\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\nB\nack in 2016,\nwhen the rest\nof my family\nwere on holiday\nin Hong Kong (where I\nrefused to go as I needed\nto revise for my January\nexams), my mother said\nI needed to take some\nrest by taking some time\noff as I was working too\nhard. So I decided to\nbook a last minute flight\nwith Thai Airways to join\nthem there. However,\nthere were no seats left\nanywhere except for First\nClass because it was the\nChristmas Holidays, and\nso I had no choice \u2013 and\nthat\u2019s how this trip\nhappened.\nOn-Ground Experience\nWhen I got off my car\nat Bangkok Airport, there\nwas a porter who came to\ntake care of my luggage.\nWe proceeded to walk\nto the check-in counter\nwhich looked like the\nones you see in hotels.\nAfter that, I met a lady\nwho escorted me to the\nfast track, which included\nsecurity and immigration\nchecks. I spent less than\nfive minutes there which\nis considered unbelievably quick.\nThen I visited the Royal\nOrchid Spa, available\nexclusively to First and\nBusiness Class passen-gers, where I got a complimentary back massage\nfor one hour. After I got\nrefreshed at the Spa, I\nheaded to the First Class\nlounge. There I found a\ndining area, where I sat\ndown and ordered from\nthe a-la-carte menu, just\nlike in restaurants (except\nthat it was free here). Later\nI went to the bar, which\nhad a wide selection of\ndrinks, and ordered my\nfavourite \u201cfruit punch\u201d.\nThe lounge was certainly\nan excellent place to relax,\nand the only thing I didn\u2019t\nlike was the lack of international newspapers, such\nas Wall Street Journal or\nthe Financial Times.\nOn Board Experience\nBefore boarding my\nplane, I met another\nmember of the airline\u2019s\nstaff who escorted me to\nthe gate and helped me to\ncarry my hand luggage. I\nthen found my way to my\nseat, located on the upper\ndeck. It was a typical\nmodern first class seat,\nequipped with a large\nentertainment screen: you\ncan find this kind of design\non most inter-continental\nairlines. A glass of DomP\u00e9rignon champagne was\nserved prior to take off,\nand after the flight had\ndeparted, I went to check\nout the lavatory \u2013 it was\nmuch larger than the ones\nin Economy or Business\nClass. There was also a\nbuilt-in powder table for\npacked touristy places to\na quiet living area. There\nare many dead-ends but\nit\u2019s practically impossible to get lost. You can\nalso follow the canals,\nthe Venetian version of\nstreets \u2013 there are no cars,\njust private boats, public\nferries (water-buses), and\ngondolas roaming the\nwaters. Just be prepared to\nencounter huge crowds of\npeople, especially if you\ntravel in summer.\nWhile exploring, don\u2019t\nforget to visit the main\nattractions too \u2013 the Rialto\nBridge and St Mark\u2019s\nBasilica. The entry to the\nBasilica is free but the\nqueues are long, and be\nprepared to pay if you\nwant to visit its museum,\nladies located inside.\nBefore the breakfast\nservice commenced, I\nhad received a menu with\nabout four choices of main\ncourse. However, it was\nalso possible to have pre-booked the meal before\nbut it was too late for me.\nMy breakfast consisted of\nthree parts: assorted fruit,\ncereal, and \u201clobster rice\nporridge\u201d which I chose\nfor the main, and unfortunately it tasted awful.\nAfter the meal service\nhad finished, I reclined\nmy seat to the fully-flat\nposition and took about\nan hour-long nap. It was\na comfortable journey,\npartly because the weather\non the way to Hong Kong\nwas very nice. We arrived\nto our destination slightly\nearlier than expected.\nAgain, with the advantages of the First Class,\nit only took me about 15\nminutes to get from the\nplane door to the taxi.\nSo overall, was it worth\nflying First Class with\nThai Airways for under\nthree hours? I would say\nno, especially if you\u2019re\nnot using any mileage\nredemption to reduce the\nhighcost(itcostmearound\nTHB 36700 or \u00a3860 for an\nonline-discounted return\nticket between Bangkok\nand Hong Kong). The\nmeal quality was the major\ndrawback, and the airline\nneeds to put more effort in\nthis matter. On the other\nhand, their ground service\nwas remarkable and is\nprobably what attracts\nmost flyers.\nThe Royal Orchid Spa, one of the perks of Thai AIrways First Class // Noppasit Pongsak\ntreasury, or the Bell\nTower.\nGondola rides officially\ncost \u20ac80 for 40min but\nit\u2019s for the whole boat\nthat fits six people, so\nyou can split the cost. The\ngondoliers might raise the\nprice though \u2013 you can\ntry to bargain. You can\nalso purchase tour tickets\nonline and find the best\nvalue-for-money option.\nOtherwise, you can get\na 24-hour public transport\npass for \u20ac20, including\nunlimited water bus and\nland bus trips (land buses\nin the mainland). You can\nuse water busses (not to\nbe confused with expensive water taxis used for\npersonal hire) to visit the\nneighbouring islands, like\nMurano, famous for its\nglass-making industry,\nwhere you can attend a\nglass-making demonstra-tion.\nSituated a bit further\nout, Burano Island is\nfull of brightly-coloured\nhouses that together with\nblue canals and colourful\nboats create a picturesque\nview. Get those Instagram\nfilters ready! Finally, you\ncan visit the beach in Lido\nIsland. These boat rides\nlet you savour the views\nof the blue sea all around\nbut they are quite long\n(60 minutes or more) so\nmaybe don\u2019t risk it if you\nhave a flight to catch.\n\n"

Perhaps, while we contemplate these\nideas, it is worth checking out Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s\ncandid but thorough exploration of the\ntranshumanism movement. Winner of this year\u2019s\nWellcome Book Prize, To Be a Machine is the first\nfull-length book on the topic. Transhumanism\nis science fiction come true \u2013 an attempt to use\ntechnology to fundamentally alter the human\nFelix recommends \u2013 reading for summer days\nJingjie Cheng and Fred Fyles take you through their books for the perfect summer day, as well as brand-new\ntitles for you to check out over the break!\nV\nirginia Woolf\u2019s most well-known work\ncrackles with a vibrant energy and zest.\nSet on a \u2018Wednesday in mid-June\u2019, it\nremains one of the best portrayals of\nLondon in the early summer, full of the vibrant\noptimism that characterises long days in the city.\nTaking place over the course of a single day, Mrs\nDalloway is propelled along with a fierce internal\nmotion, taking on a vast range of viewpoints and\nideas.\nWoolf\u2019s prose is a vivid stream of consciousness\nthat skips from character to character, like a vast\nbird swooping through London, creating an\nincredibly sense of lightness. At the same time,\nWoolf explores a number of significant themes,\nsuch as the nature of temporal reality and the\ntreatment of mental illness (something Woolf\nherself had experience of), as well as a radically\ndaring look at sexuality and sapphism. 20th\nJune\nis \u2018Dalloway Day\u2019, and I recommend setting it\naside to read this brilliant novel, ideally in the\ngarden, with a gentle breeze blowing through\nthe pages. \u2013 FF\nY\nes, I am aware a book about deep loss\nand a journey through grief might not\nbe the first thing that comes to mind\nwhen you think of what you might\nwant to take with you on the beach, but hear me\nout. The Year of Magical Thinking is Joan Didion\u2019s\naccount of the year following the death of her\nhusband, the novelist John Gregory Dunne, who\ndied suddenly in 2003: \u201cLife changes fast. Life\nchanges in the instant. You sit down to dinner\nand life as you know it ends.\u201d\nOver the course of the year, Didion explores\nher reaction to grief, and continually replays the\nevents of her husband\u2019s death. It\u2019s an incredibly\nmoving portrayal of the extreme loneliness of\ngrief, as well as a brilliant tribute to the life she\nand Dunne built together. Didion\u2019s prose style is\ninstantly recognisable \u2013 she occupies a certain\nmiddle distance, cool and detached, located\nhalfway between the investigative reporter and\nthe unreliable narrator. While her earlier essay\nwork might be more evocative of the Californian\ndispatches for which she is known, The Year of\nMagical Thinking has a sense of weightlessness\nthat I always associated with long summer\nevenings, when time blurs into nothingness. \u2013 FF\nMrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf\ncondition, to transform humans into something\ncompletely different. Or rather, to improve\nhumans in various aspects to make us better than\nthe flesh-and-bones animals that we are. These\nideas range from isolated body enhancements\nto people who believe that technology can\nhelp us solve the problem of death. O\u2019Connell\nwrites about the movement\u2019s philosophical and\nscientific roots, key players, and possible futures.\nAmid the optimism is, of course, the question of\nethics, and to some, these ideas should remain\nin the realm of dystopian films. Pick up this book\nover summer and decide for yourself! \u2013 JC\nTo be a Machine by Mark O\u2019Connell\nThe Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion\nO\nver the course of three works of non-fiction, Olivia Laing has established\nherself as one of the most important\nwriters working today, describing\nindividuals ranging from Virginia Woolf to Andy\nWarhol with a sense of beauty and wonderful\npathos. It is difficult, for me, to think of a more\ngenerous writer than Laing, who always treats\nher subjects with the respect and attention they\ndeserve. This summer sees the release of Crudo,\nW\ninner of the 2016 Forward Prize\nfor Poetry, the prolific TrinidadianBritish poet Vahni Capildeo\npublished her eighth poetry\ncollection earlier this year. VenusasaBear is about\nobjects and the natural world, putting them at\nthe centre and delicately describing how humans\nand humanity revolve around objects. From\nwaiting for lambing at a friend\u2019s farm, to a tour\nwith poets around the Ashmolean Museum in\nOxford, to criss-crossing the British Isles, Capildeo\ndraws on the life of the non-human world, and\nexplores our affinities with things. Many of the\npoems in this collection are short, exploring\nobjects of different times, places and origins.\nCapildeo does not shy away from Romantic\nanthropomorphism, because stripping objects\nof our human projections is so difficult. Capildeo\nembraces it instead \u2013 with love, sensitivity, and\nwit. -JC\nF\new recent writers can claim to have as\nmuch influence on the short story form\nas the late Irish writer William Trevor, who\ndied in 2016. Published posthumously, his\naptly titled final collection Last Stories is in stark\ndefiance of Martin Amis\u2019worry that a writer in old\nage will naturally go slack. The New York Times\ndescribed Trevor\u2019s last collection as \u2018seemingly\nquiet but ultimately volcanic\u2019, full of stories that\nare simply told but cut deep. Known for his\nimpersonal,precisewriting,Trevorhasbeencalled\nas a virtuoso of the short story. Most notably, his\nopening sentences are spare and mundane, yet\none can see the magnetic draw of something like\n\u201c\u2018Yes?\u2019Olivia says on the answering system when\nthe doorbell rings in the middle of\u2018The Return of\nthe Thin Man\u2019\u201d. Limited by their brevity, a good\nshort story describes complex relationships and\nsituations in snapshots. For Trevor, they can be\ndescribed in one sentence. \u2013 JC\nVenus as a Bear by Vahni Capildeo\nher debut novel. Set over the horrific summer\nof 2017, when Trump was (and is) edging us all\ntowards nuclear war, Britain was (and is) trapped\nunder the weight of Brexit, and the world seemed\nto be ending all around us, Crudo shows us life\nthrough the eyes of Kathy, a writer about to take\nher first steps into her forties. It\u2019s released in\nbookstores on 28th\nJune, and I\u2019ve already marked\nit down in my diary \u2013 so should you. \u2013FF\nCrudo by Olivia Laing\nLast Stories by William Trevor\n// Picador\n//Penguin\nI\nn an era of Amazon drones and book-sellers\nclosing up shop, it\u2019s up to independent\npublishers to keep us alive.

If Wojnarowicz\u2019s\nmemoir Close to the Knives is anything to go by,\nThe Waterfront Journals should be a collection\nthat fizzles with energy and exuberance, one\nthat explores the underbelly of American life by\ngiving voice to those living in its shadows. Taking\non hustlers and addicts, hoboes and runaways,\nThe Waterfront Journals are expected to provide\na much-needed portrayal of America in the latter\nhalf of the 20th\ncentury. \u2013 FF\nThe Waterfront Journals by David Wojnarowicz\n/\n/\nP\ne\nninsula Press\n\n"

During this\nbreak, she grappled with\nthe artistic block she\nexperienced as she had\na child and mourned the\nloss of her mother. Youth\nNovel, Wounded Rhymes,\nand I Never Learn were\na trilogy; exploring the\ntrials and tribulations of\nher twenties, Li said writing the three albums set\nher free, but it is apparent\nfrom her latest album she\nis yet to step down from\nher throne as queen of\nsummertime sadness.\nHer first single from\nthe album, \u2018hard rain\u2019, is\nthe opening track. At the\nstart, her distinct voice,\nbacked by synths, croons\nout in a style reminiscent\nof her previous album, but\nis quickly layered with\nothers, taking on a more\nrobotic quality. The production is also distinctly\nclean, and the influences\nfrom American hip-hop\nare clear. The next track,\n\u2018deep end\u2019 has a dubstep\nedge. \u2018two nights\u2019 starts\nlike a piano backed\nballad that could belong\non either of Li\u2019s other\nalbums, but a feature from\nPortland rapper Amine\nsets it apart. His flow is\nsharp and punchy, contrasting beautifully with\nLi\u2019s melodic warbling.\nThe next few tracks are\nself-indulgent in a way\nonly Lykke Li can pull\noff. \u201cLet me keep the last\npiece of my heart, before\nyou tear it all apart\u201d she\nlaments on \u2018last piece\u2019,\nbefore concluding \u201cI\nknow we\u2019re gonna make\nit someday\u201d on \u2018jaguars in\nthe air\u2019. Both tracks have\nrepetitive lyrics, making\nthem irritating at first, but\nimpossibly catchy by the\nfourth or fifth listen.\nironic.

Cynicism\nis difficult to sustain with\nemotion delivered so\nauthentically. The album\ncloses on the powerful\n\u2018utopia\u2019.

He\nstudied English at New\nOrleans University,\nwriting music on the side,\nbefore Hurricane Katrina\ndestroyed his studio and\nuprooted his life. Ocean\nmade the decision to\nmove to Los Angeles\nto fully pursue music,\nearning a song-writing\ndeal, penning lyrics and\nmelodies for other artists\nbefore joining up with the\nOFWGKTA (Odd Future)\nhip-hop/art collective and\nsigning a contract with\nDef Jam records. He then\nreleased the highly acclaimed Nostalgia, Ultra\nmixtape in 2011, before\nworking on other music\nincluding songs on Kanye\nWest and Jay-Z\u2019s Watch\nthe Throne and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s\nBeyonc\u00e9. In the midst of\nOcean\u2019s momentous rise\nto success, he released an\nopen letter on his Tumblr\naccount recounting his\nunrequited love for a male\nfriend one summer when\nhe was 19 years old. He\nreleased the Grammywinning album Channel\nOrange in 2012, and\nthen \u2013 after a four-year\nsilence \u2013 Ocean released\nthe visual album Endless,\nand the album Blonde.\nI\u2019ve been regularly\nlistening to Blonde for\nthe past 18 months. The\nalbum never gets stale:\nOcean has packed so\nmany ideas into 17 songs\nthat each listen reveals\nanother layer of musical\nand lyrical content.\nIn terms of sound, the\natmospheric, sometimes\nethereal Blonde contrasts\nto the cinematic, more accessible Channel Orange.\nThe mood of the album\nis melancholy, reflective,\nand introspective.\n\u201cThe album\nnever gets\nstale: Ocean\nhas packed\nin so many\nideas that each\nlisten reveals\nanother layer\nof musical and\nlyrical content\u201d\nPrevious reviews of\nChannel Orange said\nOcean has pushed the\nboundaries of R&B,\ncausing him to state his\ndislike for such a label,\nsaying it\u2019s \u201cinaccurate\nwhen you\u2019re making\nmusic inspired by so\nmany different things\u201d.\nMoving forward, Blonde\ncompletely transcends\nclassification. A flowing\nchannel of collaborators\nruns through the album,\nwith Ocean melding\nthem together to create a\nsound that fits his vision.\nThe collaborators aren\u2019t\ngiven the spotlight, but\nare mostly used akin to\nsession musicians: Radiohead guitarist Jonny\nGreenwood provides\nswelling string arrangements on \u2018Seigfried\u2019,\nBeyonce adds her backing\nvocals to a harmonic\norchestra of voices at the\nend of \u2018Pink + White\u2019,\nAndre 3000 of Outkast\nspits a frantic verse on\n\u2018Solo (Reprise)\u2019, and \u2013 in a\npleasant surprise \u2013 rapper\nYung Lean\u2019s murmurs are\nused as vocal texture in\n\u2018Godspeed\u2019.\nEach song on the\nalbum shifts and changes\nthroughout the course of\nlistening. Ocean changes\nhis melodies with each\nsong, leading to much less\nrepetition than previous\nworks, giving Blonde\ndepth by refraining\nfrom forcing hooks and\nchoruses on the listener.\nOcean similarly treats his\nvoice to an instrument,\nlayering it in a swelling\nchoir on \u2018White Ferrari\u2019,\nand applying changing\neffects to it in songs such\nas \u2018Nikes\u2019.\nThe changing melodies\nare compounded by fluid,\ncontinuously changing\nsoundscapes. In \u2018Nikes\u2019,\nfoggy synths, keyboards,\nand cinematic samples\nsubtly blend into each\nother as they enter and\nexit the song, accompanied by a sparse, changing\ndrum line.\nThe musicians on\nBlonde often separately\nprovided parts on songs\nwithout ever hearing the\nfinal product, contributing\nto the ethereal mood of\nthe album as ambient,\ndisconnected lines slowly\nslide in and out of focus.\nKeyboardist Buddy Ross,\nwho provided the backing\ntrack for \u2018Facebook Story\u2019\nand \u2018Be Yourself\u2019, said\n\u201c[Ocean] has this vision\nthat no one else really is\nprivy to. A lot of times\nyou don\u2019t even know what\nyou\u2019re working on. He\njust puts blinds on everybody and sends them off\nin their own space to just\ndo whatever they want\u201d.\nBlonde is sonically\nbare in comparison to the\nbolder Channel Orange,\nwith more subtle harmonies and a minimal range\nof instruments. Drum\nparts appear on under half\nthe album. Ocean is often\nonly accompanied by a\nsingle guitar or keyboard,\nserving to further emphasise the imagery of his\nlyrics, the melody, and\nthe emotional tone of his\nvoice.\nOcean\u2019s feelings are\npalpable through the tone\nof his voice alone \u2013 he\nalternates between tender\nand reflective in \u2018Ivy\u2019,\noffers solemn, emotional\nprayer on \u2018Godspeed\u2019,\nand gives a frenetic\ndeclaration backed by\nsomething approaching a\nchoral summoning chant\non \u2018Pretty Sweet\u2019.\nHe remains a powerful\nstoryteller, able to\ninvoke strong images\nand feelings through his\nlyrics. \u201cRemember when\nI had that Lexus, no, our\nfriendship don\u2019t go back\nthat far\u201d, he wryly sings on\n\u2018Futura Free\u2019. On \u2018Good\nGuy\u2019, Ocean reminisces\nabout meeting someone in\nNew York from a dating\napp, reflecting \u201cYou text\nnothing like you look\u201d\nand \u201chere\u2019s where I\nrealised you talk so much\nmore than I do\u201d. Standout\nimagery comes from the\nspoken word section on\n\u2018Seigfried\u2019, where Ocean\nsays \u201cLess morose and\nmore present/Dwell on\nmy gifts for a second/A\nmoment, one solar flare\nwe\u2019re consumed, so why\nnot/spend this flammable\npaper on the film that\u2019s\nmy life\u201d.\nOne slight gripe comes\nwith \u2018Solo (Reprise)\u2019,\nwhich is difficult to listen\nto casually, due to its\ndissonant sound and pace\ncompared to the rest of\nthe album. The standout\nsongs on the album can\ngenuinely change with\ntime as different things\nare taken from the album,\nbut the transcendent\nmoment when the drums\nstart on \u2018Pretty Sweet\u2019 is a\ngenuine highlight.\nOcean\u2019s commitment\nto his vision, ability to\nconsistently break new\nground, and refusal to\ncompromise what he\ncreates have produced a\nmasterpiece. He is one of\nthe best musicians of his\ngeneration. I\u2019ve had more\nthan a few dreams where\nI\u2019ve met Frank Ocean and\ndidn\u2019t really know what to\nsay.\nThey say he lives in\nNotting Hill, about half an\nhour away from Imperial\ncampus. It would probably\nbe better for music\u2019s sake\nif we didn\u2019t disturb him.\nBlondes really do have more fun // Boys Don\u2019t Cry\nMUSIC\nBen Man\nMusic Writer\n\n"

A\nshowcase of everything\nto get hyped about and\nenjoy for the future in\nthe world of gaming. So,\nwithout further ado, here\u2019s\nour evaluation of the main\nconferences of E3.\nEA \u2013 Decent\nRight off the bat, EA\nmade a course correction\nin light of the whole loot\nbox fiasco from last year,\nwhich saw a wave of\ninternational criticism\naccusing them of encouraging gambling. They acknowledged their mistake,\nand promised to try and\nwork better on it from\nnow on. At least some\npeople have learnt their\nlessons. They when on to\nshowcase Unravel 2 and\nAnthem, which were both\nreally impressive, and\ntalked about their future\nplans with upcoming Star\nWars games: additions\nto the current Battlefront\n2 and a new game in the\nfuture. However, they kept\nmum about Battlefield 5\u2019s\neconomy, which, despite\ntheir assurances of saying\nthey understood the\nproblem with loot boxes,\nseemed a bit disingenu-ous. Highlights \u2013 Unravel\n2, Battlefield 5, Anthem\nBethesda \u2013 Good\nFallout 76 was front\nand centre at Bethesda\u2019s\nconference; they went all\nout and provided lots of\ndetails, which was a blast\nto hear about. Fallout 76\nwould be the first online\ngame in the Fallout series,\nwith a map four times as\nlarge as that from the\nprevious version, and the\nability to launch nuclear\nmissiles to boot. You\ncan also own and wear\nyour own Fallout helmet.\nApart from this, they also\nshowcased other games\nlike Wolfenstein, a Doom\nsequel, and Elder Scrolls\nVI, all with release dates\nand ample information.\nHighlights \u2013 Fallout 76,\nElder Scrolls VI, Wolfenstein\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s\nconference\nwas where all\nthe good stuff\nwas, making a\nchange from\nlast year\u201d\nMicrosoft \u2013 Great\nAh, now this is where\nthe good stuff was. Microsoft\u2019s conference was a\ncomplete change from last\nyear\u2019s more disappointing\nblowout. Maybe it was\ndue to the Xbox One\u2019s\nlacklustre performance\nbut the tactic they went\nfor was to focus on a wide\nvariety of games. And\nboy did they deliver: all\ngames were shown with\ntrailers, release dates, and\na fair bit of inside information about the games\nthemselves. A number of\nSquare Enix games were\nalso showcased which\nwas a nice treat. They\nalso talked about their\nplans for the future, with\na cloud gaming service,\nand about all the studios\nthey\u2019ve bought, and plan\nto buy. A really well done\nperformance by Microsoft\nall around, impressing us\nwith their tenacity and\nhonesty. Highlights \u2013\nForza Horizon 4, Devil\nMay Cry 5, Jump Force,\nOri and the Will of the\nWisps\nSquare Enix \u2013 Poor\nMan, talk about so\nmuch hype followed by so\nmuch disappoint. Many\ninteresting things were\nexpected here, from a new\nrumoured Avengers game\nto the next Final Fantasy\ngame fans were eagerly\nwaiting for. Instead, all\nwe got were two short\nteasers for The Quiet Man\nand Babylon\u2019s Fall, which\nbarely highlighted any\ngameplay or release dates.\nSquare Enix basically shot\nthemselves in the foot by\ngiving a good majority\nof their upcoming stuff\nto Microsoft, meaning\nthere was very little they\ncould show themselves.\nIt was them at their most\ncomplacent, and they\nreally need to bring their\nA game next time round.\nHighlights \u2013 Just Cause\n4, Shadow of the Tomb\nRaider, Kingdom Hearts 3\nUbisoft \u2013 Really Good\nLong story short,\nUbisoft\u2019s conference\nwas solid and enjoyable\n\u2013 there\u2019s not a whole lot\nof bad things you can\nsay about it. A number of\ngames were highlighted\nwhere ship battles seem\nto be the new schtick for\nthe future, and Beyond\nGood and Evil 2 provided\nbreathtaking visuals in\njust a trailer. Star Fox\njoining the Switch version\nof Starlink was a nice\nsurprise and a good payoff\nof Ubisoft\u2019s relationship\nwith Nintendo. Highlights\n\u2013 Beyond Good and Evil 2,\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey,\nSkull and Bones\nNintendo \u2013 Really\nGood\nLastyear,thesewerethe\nguys who knocked it out\nof the park in E3. Whether\nyou think the same is true\nthis year depends on how\nmuch you like Smash. The\nreason being that Nintendo\u2019s main focus was Super\nSmash Bros. Ultimate for\nthe Switch. There were a\nlot of reveals, and much\nto like, such as all the\ncharacters from previous\nversions, some new ones,\nand touched up aesthetics.\nApart from Smash, more\ngames were highlighted\nto maintain momentum\nwith the Switch like a\nnew Fire Emblem and\nFortnite! Sadly other\nfranchises like Pok\u00e9mon\nand Animal Crossing were\nbarely touched upon and\nit seems the 3DS is all but\nforgotten now. Highlights\n\u2013 Super Smash Bros.\nUltimate, Fire Emblem:\nThree Houses, Super\nMario Party\nSony \u2013 OK\nThis is the second\nyear in a row where\nSony has failed to make\na huge impact at E3. The\nmain focus was on four\ngames which are hugely\nanticipated by fans, but\nwere known about well in\nadvance. It was essentially\na compact hour of trailers\nand gameplay footage. It\nwas nice, but truthfully\nonly Ghost of Tsushima\nneeded such a boost, as\nlittle had been shown of\nthe game beforehand. In\na strange move, Sony\nactually revealed several\nother games, but only\nto those watching the\nlive stream of the event.\nWith the last year being\nincredibly successful for\nSony, it\u2019s possible they\ndidn\u2019t feel they needed\nto give much and were\nprobably saving their\nenergy for (rumour has it)\na Playstation 5 down the\nline. Highlights \u2013 Death\nStranding, The Last of\nUs Part II, Spider-Man,\nGhost of Tsushima\nForza 4 and The Last of Us Part II were two games that made a big impression at E3 // Microsoft/Sony\n\n"

It\u2019s a bit of a loose\ninterpretation of what\u2018group study\u2019means.\nThe only non-South Kensington place recorded\nwas the Reynolds Building, which is located on\nthe Charing Cross campus.

On the whole,\npeople generally thought Imperial had affected their sex life positively. However,\nthis result is made less useful by the fact we didn\u2019t put in a baseline measure \u2013\nwhether students thought their sex life would be better at another university, for\nexample.\nIt could be that \u2013 since the majority of people become sexually active around\nthe time they are going to university \u2013 sex lives would inevitably improve once\npeople arrived at university, irrespective of where they went. Nevertheless, there\nremained a significant proportion who felt Imperial had worsened their sex life.\nThe Department of Life Sciences was judged to be the hottest\ndepartment, followed by Medicine and Bioengineering. Looking at\ndistribution of votes, however, a clear pattern emerges: students were\nhighly likely to say the department to which they belonged was the\nhottest. This is particularly clear with the Departments of Medicine, Life\nSciences, and Bioengineering. Students from the Department of Earth\nScience and Engineering were also likely to rate themselves as attractive,\ndespite coming near the middle of the rankings as a whole.\nWhile Life Sciences was the most attractive department, people\nthought Medicine was the department that had the most sex.

The first day started\noff the back of a 4am\narrival into Tel Aviv-Yafo\nairport. Then heading\nto Jaffa, the Old City,\nsituated a few kilometers\nsouth of Tel Aviv, where\nwe soaked up the rich\nand vibrant atmosphere,\nbefore hitting the hay at\n3am the next day.\nAmongst the array of\nworld-renowned companies visited on the trip,\nCheckpoint stood out the\nmost. Checkpoint delivers\npioneering cyber-secu-rity services, and their\ntalk detailed the current\nlandscape of cyber-se-curity. We were treated\nthat evening to dinner\nby some local residents\nwho used the EatWith\napp (https://www.eatwith.\ncom/), which allows local\nresidents to open up their\nhomes for dinner (for a\ngroup of 55 in this case!),\nwith some live music\nthrough the night.\nThe tech highlight of\nday two was our visit to\nlocal start-ups, Carbyne,\nand healthy.io. The former\ndelivers video capabilities\nto emergency calls for\nfirst responders, while the\nlatter optimises chronic\ndisease management\nusing AI. Whilst the\ntechnology piqued our\ninterest, lunch for that day\nwas what stole the show\n\u2013 a food tour of Carmel\nMarket, tasting the local\ndelicacies such as sabich\nand malabi. Sabich is a\npita filled with aubergine,\neggs, and tahini, whereas\nmalabi is a rose-flavored\npudding similar to a\nblancmange. To bring the\nday to a close, we were\nhonoured by a talk given\nby Bennie Schneider, a\nserial entrepreneur who\ngave some useful tips\nabout starting out in the\ntech industry having sold\nhis startups, P-Cube and\nPentacom, to Cisco.\nDay three started\nwith a trip to Tel Aviv\nUniversity to learn more\nabout the higher institutional scene in Israel,\nbefore heading out to a\nKibbutz, a communal\nhomestead rooted in\nagricultural practices, in\nthe middle of the Negev.\nThis kibbutz served as\nthe HQ for Netafim \u2013 an\nirrigation manufacturer\nwho managed to cultivate\nfarmland in the desert\nconditions of the Negev.\nThen to learn more about\nlife as an Israeli student,\nwe were hosted for dinner\nby students at Beersheba\nUniversity.\nTo change pace, the\nnext morning started with\na jaunt down to the Dead\nSea to relax and recover\nfrom what had already\nbeen an action-packed\nthree days. After a monumental climb back up to\nnormal altitude, we began\nthe more cultural aspect\nof the trip, starting in Jerusalem. Here, we toured\nthe city, visiting sites such\nas the Holy Sepulchre and\nthe Western Wall. After\nsoaking in the atmosphere\nof the city, we were treated\nto an inspirational talk by\nFiona Darmon, COO at Jerusalem Venture Partners,\na venture capitalist firm\ninvesting in a diverse\nbackground of compa-nies. We then headed to\nthe market, turned from a\nbustling food market turn\ninto a bar, just as busy as it\nhad been in the day.\nOur final day in Israel\nstarted at Yad Vashem,\nIsrael\u2019s memorial to the\nvictims of the Holocaust,\nwhere we were walked\nthrough exhibits detailing the atrocities of the\nHolocaust. Next on the\nagenda was a visit to\nthe Weizmann Institute,\na higher educational\nresearch centre, where\nwe learnt more about the\nopportunities available\nto continue academia in\nIsrael after university.\nMobileEye was the final\ntech visit of the trip, and\nperhaps one of the most\nentertaining. We learnt\nmore about how self-driv-ing can be achieved, and\nhow MobileEye, a startup,\nhad been bought by Intel\nfor $15.3bn. We were able\nto discuss the technology\nbehind the system they\nhad been developing, and\nthe ethics of self-driving\nvehicles, given the recent\nnews about Tesla and\nUber accidents involving\nself-driving vehicles.\nThe experience as a\nwhole was truly eye-open-ing, giving us an inside\nlook into the history and\nfuture of a young country.\nWe were able to appreciate both the cultural and\ntech aspects of Israel, in a\nunique way \u2013 a way which\ninvolved us getting approximately no sleep for\nsix days, but was worth it\nnonetheless.\nThanks to the Israeli\nSociety Committee for\norganising such a mem-ory-forging, experiential\ntrip, and we look forward\nto seeing it grow in the\nfuture along with the\nfriendships we made!\nSee it live: bit.ly/tech-tripvlog\n\u2013 Harvinder Power\nand Shubhangi Sharma\nDay Three: View from the hotel in Beersheba // Josh Sebastian and Harvinder Power\nWe came as strangers, we left as friends // Josh Sebastian and Harvinder Power\n\n"

Since its inception,\nthe sport has exploded in\npopularity; from flinging cookie tin lids in a\nplay-ground to being recognized by International\nOlympic Committee in\nless than 60 years! With\nthat in mind, I got in\ncontact with Imperial\u2019s\nvery own club, the disc\nDoctors (dD), to find out\nwhat the hype was about.\nI arrived a little early\nand gradually met the\nteam as they trickled in,\ngathering around a tree\nclose to the old Hyde Park\nfootball fields. It was late\nFebruary, and a stiff cold\nbreeze blew, but it didn\u2019t\nseem to affect the others,\nwho were bright eyed and\nbushy tailed. There was a\nvery friendly atmosphere,\nwith teammates feeling\ncomfortable in one-another\u2019s presence; what I\nsensed was a team that\nwere close-knit and at\nthe tail end of the season.\nAlthough I was a newbie I\nfelt very much welcomed\nand I was not treated as an\noutsider.\nWarm ups consisted\nof throwing the frisbee a\nmoderate distance to one\nanother, while a veteran\nplayer took me under\nhis wing to show me the\nropes. I must admit that\ngoing into the session I\nassumed that I would be\ngood at throwing, being\nof moderate arm strength\nand possessing enough coordination for most sports.\nWhat I forgot to factor in\nis that those sports used\nballs not frisbees, and I\nslowly realized that with\nfrisbees there must be\na more delicate touch.\nInstead of a ball that is\npropelled and hindered\nby the air, a well-thrown\nfrisbee glides on it. The\ntrajectory of the frisbee is\nvery sensitive to release,\nwrist action, and angle\nthan any ball. Once you\nsee an Ultimate veteran\nthrow a frisbee you\nacquire a respect for the\nskill needed; it\u2019s nothing\nlike how you throw them\non a warm summer\u2019s day\nat the beach.\nDuring the warm ups I\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\nlike how you\nthrow a frisbee\non a warm\nsummer\u2019s day\nat the beach\u201d\n\u201cThe X factor\nof Ultimate\nis the ethos\nattached to\nthe sport \u2013 the\nspirit of the\ngame\u201d\nwas taught the two most\nbasic throws: backhand\nand forehand throws.\nBackhand is the one you \u2013\nthe reader \u2013 are probably\nmost familiar with: it\u2019s\nlike back hand slapping\nthe air with the frisbee,\nwhilst the forehand is like\nslicing precisely, with a\nlot of flick of the wrist,\nas you throw. I was also\ntaught what I\u2019d like to call\nthe crocodile technique\nfor catching the frisbee.\nOnce thrown to me I\nslapped my hands over the\nfrisbee sandwiching it like\nthe jaws of a crocodile\n(there must be an actual\nname for that technique).\nFeeling more confident\nand with more players\narriving we moved onto a\ndrill.\nThe drill consisted of\na few passes and then\na long pass down field\nto someone who was\nrunning. With my newly\nacquired confidence the\ninitial passes were alright,\nbut on the longer pass I\nmessed up. Then the next\ntime I messed up again,\nand again, and again. The\ncaptain noticed what I\nwas doing, having played\nAmerican football for\nsuch a long time I was not\nthrowing the frisbee level,\nand when throwing a high\npowered long pass; as a\nresult, the slightest failure\nin technique was ampli-fied. I tried to correct the\nlong pass technique, but\nto no avail; with more\npractice I think I eventually would\u2019ve got it.\nFor the final part of\nthe session we played\na match. Instead of the\nusual seven-a-side which\nis standard, we played\nfive-a-side due to lack\nof players. It is at that\npoint I came to grips with\nthe basics of the sport.\nUltimate feels to me like\nan amalgamation of many\nsports. The aim of the\ngame is to get someone\nto catch the frisbee in\nthe end zone, which has\nsimilarities to American\nFootball. You can\u2019t run\nwhen you\u2019re in possession\nof the frisbee and you\nmust throw it within a\nspecific time frame \u2013 that\u2019s\nlike netball. I say it\u2019s an\namalgamation, but it\u2019s got\na little extra and feels a lot\ndifferent when actually\nplaying it. Yes, it involves\nthe oddly shaped frisbee,\nbut that isn\u2019t the X factor.\nWhat I would consider\nthe X factor is the ethos\nattached to the game. This\nmay seem outlandish but\nthrough my time with\nthe club there seemed to\nbe a nurturing of what is\ncoined the \u2018spirit of the\ngame\u2019. In Ultimate there\nare no external referees\n\u2013 it is self-officiating,\nwith that a silent pledge\nto respect each other,\nadhere to the rules, and\nto play fundamentally for\nthe joy of the game. There\nweren\u2019t any sour feelings\nThe club is doing very\nwell, with a tour at the beginning of each academic\nyear; different tiers; 1st\n,\n2nd\n, and 3rd\nteams; indoor\nand outdoor teams; mixed,\nmen and ladies teams; and\na social scene too. They\ncompete on a national\nstage, with many of the\nplayers playing outside\nof the club in the best\nnon-University teams in\nthe UK. Training sessions\nare usually Wednesdays\nand Saturdays, with\ngames on Sundays. In the\nfirst term, players can get\na true taste of Ultimate,\nwith tournaments catered\nfor beginners. Further\ninto the season the club\ncompetes in national\ncompetitions and the club\nhave done very well in the\npast.

I was\ncoached on the field too,\nand my teammates tried\nto put me in a position to\nscore to ensure I enjoyed\nmy time. There was an\nunderstanding to enjoy\nthe game, with healthy\ncompetition too.\n\n"

As well as removing\nthe cooked breakfast\noption, they increased\nprices across all outlets,\nreviewed portion sizes,\nand reduced opening\nhours of food outlets.\nThe changes, which\nwere made by Campus\nServices, a branch of\nthe College, were made\n\u201cwhere reinvestment can\ndemonstrably be made\nto the wider benefit of\nthe community, against a\nminimal impact on staff\nand students.\u201d\nThe changes, which\nstudents and staff were\nnot consulted on, left a\nnumber very upset. One\nacademic told Felix the\nchanges were \u201coutrageous\u201d, while another\nsaid \u201cit sounds like [when\nthe College talk about]\n\u2018reducing their cost\u2019, it\u2019s\nreally coming out of our\npocket.\u201d\nAround three months\nafter the changes came\ninto effect, Imperial\nCollege Union launched\na survey, asking staff and\nstudents about campus\nservices and opening\nhours. The Union has not\nreported on the results of\nthe survey. \u2013 FF\nStrikes hit Imperial\namid pension dispute\nMore than 60 universities were disrupted by\nstrikes as staff protested\nagainst proposed changes\nto their pensions which\ncould have seen lecturers\nlose up to 60% of their\nfinal pension pot. Fourteen\ndays of escalating strike\naction took place over\nfour weeks earlier this\nyear. A further fourteen\ndays of strikes planned to\ndisrupt end-of-year exams\nwere narrowly averted\nas the University and\nCollege Union, representing teaching and support\nstaff, agreed to a deal\nwhich will maintain the\ncurrent pension scheme\nuntil at least April 2019.\nStudents have been told\nexams will not include\ncontent missed as a result\nof the strikes. A class\naction lawsuit has been\nlaunched by legal firm\nAssersons on behalf of\nstudents seeking a refund\nof their tuition fees. The\ncase involves more than\n5,000 students, who could\nreceive several hundred\npounds each.\nLast week, Felix\nrevealed Imperial has so\nfar withheld just under\n\u00a3280,000 from staff\ninvolved in the strike.\nUnlike other universi-ties, Imperial has not\nring-fenced this money\nfor student support and\nservices.\nUniversities, including\nImperial, supported the\nswitch to a defined contribution scheme (where\npension value is linked to\nthe stock market), claiming the current University\nSuperannuation Scheme\nhad a \u00a37.5 billion deficit\nand was \u201cnot likely to be\nsustainable\u201d. \u2013 JW\nUnion criticised over\nhandling of sexual assault case\nIn first term, Felix\nreported on the case of an\nalumna, Helen, who had\nbeen sexually assaulted\nby a current student when\nreturning to Imperial for\nan event. The assault took\nplace on Union property.\nAfter reporting the case\nto the Union, the Union\nand College took seven\nmonths to reach a conclu-sion, during which time\nthe accused had become\npresident of a Union\nsociety.\nDuring the investiga-tion, Helen was passed\nbetween a number of\nstaff members, and was\nrepeatedly asked to\nprovide statements about\nwhat happened during\nthe evening of the assault.\nShe also went for periods\nof up to six weeks without\nany contact from the\nUnion or College.\nand recommended having\nthe perpetrator attend a\nconsent workshop, as\nwell as banning him from\nlicensed Union premises.\nThey did not recommend\nremoving him as society\npresident. \u2013 FF\nPay falling in real\nterms for Imperial\nstaff\nWages are decreasing\nin real-terms for most\nImperial staff while large\nsums are being spent on\nthe salaries of senior staff\nand the College\u2019s property\nportfolio.\nBelow-inflation pay\nrises have left staff facing\naverage salary decreases\nof 1.1% each year since\n2005, according to a pay\nclaim published by the\nJoint Higher Education\nTrade Union. Despite this,\nCollege expenditure on\nwages increased by just\nover 3% in 2016/17 due to\n\u201can exceptional increase\nin very highly paid staff\u201d.\nAt the same time, the\nunions criticised Imperial\u2019s increasing capital\nexpenditure. Referring\nto the \u00a31.42 billion spent\non property investments\nsince 2011, the joint\nunions said: \u201cClearly, the\nFebruary saw strikes hit over 60 universities // Joseph O'Connell-Danes\n\u201cHelen said\nthe Union's\nhandling of\nher sexual\nassault left\nher suicidal at\ntimes\u201d\nImperial staff pay has been falling in real terms since 2015 // Imperial/Felix\nWiththelastpaperoftheacademicyear,Editor-in-Chief\nFred Fyles and Deputy Editor Joanna Wormald check\nout some of the most important stories from the past\nacademic year.\nof news around campus\nCollege has chosen to\ndevote its surplus to buildings rather than to staff.\u201d\nOn top of this, a demanding work culture\nmeans Imperial staff work\nbeyond government-set\ntime limits and provide\nthe equivalent of two days\nper week without pay.\nThe joint trade unions\nhave set out a series of\ndemands, including a\n7.5% pay rise for staff. \u2013\nJW\nImperial revealed to\nhave large investments in tobacco and\nfossil fuels\nAn investigation by\nFelix into the endowment\nfund of Imperial revealed\nthe College had significant direct and indirect investments in the tobacco,\nfossil fuel, and weapons\nindustries.\nIn total, as of September 2017, the College was\ninvesting \u00a33.5 million\nin the tobacco industry\nof collaborating with the\nNigerian government in\nthe torture and execution\nof activists, as well as\ncrimes against humanity.\nImperial also had\n\u00a3650,000 in Philip\nMorris, \u00a3400,000 in\nImperial Brands, and\nover \u00a3370,000 indirectly\ninvested in Reynolds\nAmerican, some of the\nlargest tobacco companies\nin the world. These investments were made through\ninvestment funds, some\nof which the College had\nbeen investing in since\nat least 2013. Imperial\ncurrently has 29 research\ngroups working on cancer\nprevention, detection, and\ntreatment.\nRhidian Thomas, ImperialCollegeUnion\u2019sEthics\nand Environment Officer,\ntold Felix: \u201cI\u2019d like to\ncongratulate Imperial on\nsucceeding in bringing\ntogether a comprehensive\nselection of some of the\nmost ethically dubious\ncompanies around, all\nin one portfolio. It\u2019s\nstaggering that anyone in\nCollege thinks it appropriate for a university \u2013 a\ncharity even \u2013 to give so\nmuch money to the arms\nand extraction industries.\nEven College\u2019s commitment to avoid investing in\ntobacco seems paper-thin,\nnow that it\u2019s clear that it\nhas millions invested in it\nthrough third-party funds;\nso much for \u2018smoke-free\nImperial\u2019.\u201d \u2013 FF\nDebates continue\nover high pay and expenses among senior\nmanagement\nWhile the majority of\nImperial employees are\nexperiencing real-term\npay cuts, senior staff are\ncollectively pocketing\nmore than their counterparts at any other Russell\nGroup university.\nIn 2017, the College\nspent \u00a35.6 million on the\nsalaries of 20 \u2018key management personnel\u2019. This\ntranslates to an average\npay packet of \u00a3280,000\neach \u2013 an 8% rise on the\nprevious year\u2019s figures.\n410 members of staff are\npaid more than \u00a3100,000.\nImperial president\nAlice Gast has the second\nhighest salary of Russell\nGroup vice-chancellors\nand is paid \u00a3433,000\n(beaten only by the University of Birmingham\u2019s\nDavid Eastwood, who\ntakes home \u00a3439,000).\nOn top of her salary,\nProfessor Gast claimed\nnearly \u00a344,000 in expenses \u2013 more than the\nmedian Imperial salary.\nThe figure is also substantially greater than the\naverage Russell Group\nvice-chancellor expenses\nclaim, which is under\n\u00a310,000. The majority of\nProfessor Gast\u2019s claims\nwere for international\ntravel, with the remainder\nsplit between taxis, gifts,\nand hospitality. \u2013 JW\nCounselling Service\nstruggling with increased demand\nAs exam season kicked\nin, Felix revealed the huge\npressures the College\nCounselling Service is\nbeing put under. The\nnumber of students registering for counselling has\nincreased by over 80%\nsince 2012/13, while the\nsessions on offer have\nbeen unable to keep up.\nThe result is a waiting\ntime which now stands at\nseven weeks on average,\nwith some students reporting waiting up to 15\nweeks.\nThe Counselling\nService currently employs\nabout seven full time\nequivalents to serve a\nstudent body of 18,000.\nRosie Summerhayes,\nhead of the Counselling\nService, told Felix their\nbudget had been frozen for\nthe past two years, despite\nthe College making nearly\n\u00a3120 million in surplus\nlast year.\nThe increased wait\ntimes have had a knock-on impact on student-fac-ing staff members, who\nare now having to spend\nmore time than they\nusually would speaking to\nstudents who are finding\nthings difficult. Professor Simone Buitendijk,\nVice-Provost (Education),\ntold Felix: \u201cOur investment in student counselling will be increased\nsignificantly in the next\nfinancial year.\u201d \u2013 FF\nTeaching Excellence\nFramework undergoes significant\nchanges\nThe Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF)\nhas undergone significant\nchanges in its third year\n(not least its rebranding).\nImperial still holds a\nGold award but this is\nnot directly comparable\nto the ratings issued in\nthis year\u2019s iteration of the\nTEF.\nThree new metrics\nhave been introduced\nalongside the original\nstudent satisfaction (from\nNational Student Survey\ndata), number of students\ncompleting their course\n(rather than the number\nof students dropping out),\nand graduate outcomes six\nmonths after leaving uni-versity. These now form\nan \u201cinitial hypothesis\u201d\nwhich assessors modify\nby considering supplementary metrics as part\nof a \u201cholistic judgment\u201d.\nTo further complicate\nmatters, a flag system has\nbeen introduced. The TEF\nis now simultaneously so\ncomplicated that assessors\nwithout a background in\nadvanced data handling\nrequire extra training,\nyet \u201csimple and easy for\nstudents to understand\u201d.\nTrials are also underway for subject-level\nratings, which are\ndesigned to account for\nvarying quality within\nuniversities. Documents\nreleased by the Department for Education state\nsubject-level TEF awards\nwill provide students\nwith \u201cmore granular and\ninformative information\u201d.\nWhile these changes\nhelp to allay some concerns raised by critics\nover the years, there are\nstill worries that the TEF\nwill be used to increase\ntuition fees.\nLastyearprimeminister\nTheresa May announced\nfees would be frozen at\ncurrent levels until 2019,\nputting the kibosh on plans\nfor gold and silver-rated\nuniversities to be able to\nincrease tuition fees in\nline with inflation. Since\nthen, education secretary\nDamian Hinds has suggested universities charge\ndifferent fees to reflect\neach subject\u2019s value to\nsociety. Subject-level TEF\nawards may well facilitate\nthis. \u2013 JW\n\u201cThe College\nwas revealed\nto have\n\u00a33.5 million\nindirectly\ninvested\nin tobacco,\nthrough funds\nused since at\nleast 2013\u201d\n\u2013 indirectly, through\ninvestment portfolios\n\u2013 nearly \u00a39 million in\nthe fossil fuel industry,\nand \u00a33.1 million in the\narms industry. A number\nImperial tumbled down the ethical league tables, with Felix revealing missions of\npounds invested in the fossil fuel industry // Tom Mrazek\nHelen, who has a\nsevere, long-term mental\nhealth condition, requiring her to go to hospital\neach week for treatment,\nwas left feeling suicidal\nat times: \u201cI was consumed\nwith the case,\u201d she told\nFelix, \u201cwhile nobody\nresponsible for it seemed\nto care, or even acknowledge it. This made me feel\nmy grip on reality was\nslipping.\u201d\nWhen the Union\nreached their final deci-sion, they concluded \u201con\nbalance of probabilities\u201d\nHelen\u2019s account was true,\nof these investments\nwere direct investments,\nincluding \u00a31.5 million in\nRoyal Dutch Shell, the 7th\nlargest producer of oil and\ngas worldwide, who had\npreviously been accused\n\n"

And\nstrangely, an odd feeling\nstill haunts me.\nThe plot is all there.\nYou have a King who has\na lover, a wife who still\nloves and wants to rescue\nhim, commoners who\nstarve and die, and an\nadviser who can separate\nlove and politics. Love\nand politics \u2013 an intense\nconflict between the two\ndifferent concepts that\nrarely enter into our lives,\nbut fight it out in people\nwho owe us guidance.\nThe King \u2013 referred to\nas only this throughout\nthe show \u2013 falls in love\nwith Gaveston, one of\nthe nobles he praises and\nprovides for, even at the\nexpense of his people.\nThis reckless behaviour\nworries advisor Mortimer,\nwho advises him to stop\nthis relationship, and ends\nup exiled from the palace\n\u2013 it\u2019s a decision which sets\na train of consequences,\nending up tearing his\nfamily apart. A traditional\n\u201cThe opera\nstarts in a\ntraditional\nmanner, but\nis let down\nthanks to a\npoor libretto\u201d\n\u201cThe opera\nis undone by\ntrying to keep\nthe best of\nboth worlds:\nthe modern\nand the\nclassical\u201d\nstartforausualoperaseria,\nif it were not for the poor\nlibretto following this call\nto action. This is not to\nblame the composer, or\nactors\u2019 performances; in\nopera, music should be a\ntool to enhance the specta-cle, transforming a regular\nplay into a message that\nsinks in and leaves us with\ngood memories long after\nleaving the theatre. Above\nall, it should serve the\nplay, but the play should\nnot rely on it to keep the\nshow alive.\nIn an attempt to\nmodernise the old tale of\nEdward II, who died from\nlove and failed miserably\nin his role as monarch, the\nadaptation fell short and\ndelivered a classic tale in a\nconfusing way. A conflict\nof modern staging and\nhistorical plotting clashes\nin an unpleasant way for\nthe viewer. The reality of\nthe scenes simply do not\nmatch the main themes\napproached. This clash\nis more distinctly seen in\nthe second scene when\nMortimer brings poor\ncommoners to the palace\nto confront the queen,\nIsabel, with the problems\nthey face. This is one of\nmy favourite scenes from\nthe play, and yet it still\nfeels like something is\noff with the plot, which\nforgot to modernise the\ncharacters\u2019 dilemmas to\nthe modern staging.\nIn addition to this, the\nscript lacks the essential\nflow in verse that is sorely\nneeded in a play of this\nexpense and production.\nThis is not entirely to\nblame to the writer alone,\nbut more generally, to the\ncommunication between\ncomposition and lyrics.\nNot everything is a\ndisappointment. The\nmusic underlying the play\nshows moments of hidden\nbrilliance, with mystical\nmoments conducted with\nno powerful notes or usual\nuse of noise and easy\nemotional chords.\nThe performances\nshould be acknowledged\ntoo, with a brilliant turn\nfrom Barbara Hannigan as\nIsabel, who made herself\nheard in the vast space,\ndisplaying her soprano\nnuances. Peter Hoare,\nas Mortimer, and Gyula\nOrendt, as Gaveston, had\nvoices which matched\ntheir perfectionist stage\nperformances, with their\nsmooth and distinctive\nvoices able to occupy\nphysical space.\nIn the end, Lessons\nin Love and Violence\nwas undone by a terrible\nproblem when adapting\nold pieces into modern\nstyles: a self-absorbed\nambition to keep the best\nof both worlds, without\nchanging anything that\nactually brings something\nnew. An old story, with\na new adaptation, but\nstill same core. A sort of\nintellectual effort to keep\nthe old art alive with new\npieces that will inevitably fail every time they\nignore the need to make\nreal changes in what is\nbeing presented. History\nlectures and background\nstory should not be an\nexercisefortheviewer,but\nsomething that everyone\nis able to understand.\nHard-to-grasp dialogue,\nconfusing topics, and\nundelivered lessons result\nin an unfinished product\nfrom the artists, not to be\nconfused with elevated\nculture.\nWith all that said, I do\nnot think operas fail the\naverage arts-enthusiast.\nThey can be enjoyable\nand funny, with philanthropists financing\nproductions ensuring the\nart is continually elevated\nregardless of cultural\nshifts. Lessons in Love\nand Violence missed a\nbigger point than that. It\nfailed to create a package\nof musical melody and\ntheatrical drama that line\nup in only the best master-pieced of human talent.\nBarbara Hannigan as Isabel, St\u00e9phane Degout as King and Gyula Orendt as Gaveston in Lessons in Love and Violence\n// Stephen Cumiskey\nARTS\nJo\u00e3o Baptista\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Additionally,\nresults from six studies\nindicate 76% of people\nreport not meeting their\npersonally-imposed goals\nas the biggest regret in\ntheir lives.\nThe theory at the core\nof this research relies on\nthe idea that a person\u2019s\nsense of self depends on\nthree attributes: the ideal\nself (their life aspirations),\nactual self (attributes that\nthey possess), and ought\nself (who their obligations\nindicate they should be).\nThe following example\ncould be used to frame\nthis theory: a scientist\naspires to become a\nsuccessful academic\n(ideal self), considers\nthemselves hardworking (actual self) and is\nexpected to be productive\nby their peers, colleagues\nand public (ought self). It\nis not difficult to imagine\nhow not being able to\npersonally call themselves\na \u2018successful academic\u2019\nwould constitute a regret\nmore damaging than not\nbeing called \u2018productive\u2019\nenough by others \u2013 since\nthey are their own biggest\ncritic.\nThe researchers\nproposed an explanation\nthat has to do with our\nown set goals and resources needed to achieve\nthem, rather than our subjective experience of self.\nBeing \u201chardworking\u201d or\n\u201cproductive\u201d involves\nclear targets \u2013 a number\nof intense working hours\ndaily, and a certain output.\nPoorly defined guidelines\nfor achieving ideal-self\naspirations, meanwhile\n\u2013 such as being a \u201csuccessful scientist\u201d, a \u201cgood\nmentor\u201d, or a \u201cgood\nparent\u201d \u2013 pose harm for\nindividuals, and implicitly\nfor the society, since what\nit means to have one of\nthese attributes is, at large,\na subject to debate.\nA connection worth\nfurther investigation is\nbetween regrets concerning the ideal-self\nand impostor syndrome,\na condition that makes\npeople doubt their\naccomplishments and\nconsequently feel as if\nthey were a fraud. While\nresearch on impostor\nsyndrome is limited,\nrecently individuals have\ntaken to social media to\nvoice to raise awareness\nabout it \u2013 which has the\npotential to trigger increased scientific interest.\nA recent study published in the International\nJournal of Medical\nEducation found around\na quarter of male and half\nof female US medical\nstudents suffer from\nimposter syndrome, especially towards the end\nof medical school. The\nresearchers highlighted\none possible reason for\nsuch emotions would be\nfeelings of anxiety about\ntheir ability to practice as\na doctor upon graduation.\nAnother possible\nexplanation, in light of\nthe Cornell University\nresearch findings, may be\na discrepancy between\nour ought self and actual\nself, or the ideal self and\nactual self. Thus, an interesting research avenue\nwould be to compare and\ncontrast the ought self and\nthe ideal self, as well as to\ninvestigate what happens\nin situations when the line\nis blurred between what\none wishes for oneself and\nwhat others expect.\nResearchintobehaviour\nhas the power to teach us\na basic understanding of\nwhat being human entails,\nand, importantly, what we\ncan do to improve society.\nBy using this knowledge\nof what generates feelings\nof regret, we can improve\ncommunication about\nwhat people want to bring\nto the table, allowing\nthem to build a thriving\ncommunity at work,\nhome, or outside.\nDrop in cancer risk five years after quitting smoking\nA\nnew analysis of\nthe Framingham\nHeart Study,\nconducted by\na team of researchers led\nby Hilary Tindle MD,\nMPH at the Vanderbilt\nUniversity Medical\nCentre, has revealed\nencouraging findings for\nboth current and former\nsmokers.\nFindings from the\nStudy \u2013 which is supported by the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute,\nand examined the health\nrecords of nearly 9,000\npeople monitored over\na number of decades \u2013\nrevealed individuals who\nstop smoking had within\nfive years a 39.1% lower\nlung cancer risk relative\nto current smokers. The\nrate at which the risk\nof lung cancer reduces\nis faster than has been\npreviously reported, and\nhighlights the benefits of\nsmoking cessation. This\nrisk continues to fall as\nthe years since quitting in-creases, relative to current\nsmokers.\n\u201cIf you smoke, now\nis a great time to quit,\u201d\nsaid Professor Tindle,\nthe William Anderson\nSpickard Jr., MD Professor of Medicine at the\nVanderbilt University\nSchool of Medicine, and\nDirector of the Vanderbilt\nCenter for Tobacco, Addiction and Lifestyle. Prof.\nTindle further stated: \u201cthe\nfact that lung cancer risk\ndrops relatively quickly\nafter quitting smoking,\ncompared to continuing\nsmoking, gives new motivation.\u201d\nNevertheless, it is\nworth stressing the risk\nof lung cancer remains\nelevated despite quitting\nrelative to individuals\nwho have never smoked.\nCo-researcher Matthew\nFreiberg, MD, MSc said:\n\u201cWhile the importance of\nsmoking cessation cannot\nbe overstated, former\nheavy smokers need\nto realise that the risk\nof lung cancer remains\nelevated for decades after\nthey smoke their last cig-arette, underscoring the\nimportance of lung cancer\nscreening\u201d.\nBiotechnological advancements have allowed\nfor the use of effective\ntools such as lung cancer\nscreening, which significantly contribute to a reduction in the risk of death\ncaused by lung cancer. Its\nbenefits, however, can be\nmaximised considerably\nwhen partnered with successful quitting.\nCurrently, smoking\ncauses 1.69 million deaths\nworldwide each year from\nlung cancer, and 87%\nof lung cancer deaths in\nthe United States alone.\nNeedless to say, it very\nmuch remains a public\nhealth matter with and\naction needed from gov-ernmental, private, and\neducational entities.\nSCIENCE\nMaria Balaet\nScience Writer\nSCIENCE\nDiego F.

Are you a biology\ngeek eager to explain why\nbiology is cool? The\nanswer to such wide-rang-ing questions is synthetic\nbiology.\nWhat is synthetic\nbiology? Formally, it\nis the interdisciplinary\nscience of integrating\nengineering principles\nto biology to actively\nreimagine, reshape, and\nre-engineer living organisms and develop artificial\nbiological systems.\nIn more simple words,\nit is changing perspectives\nabout harnessing the potential of biology for practical use, borrowing from\nthe field of engineering to\nbring more rigor, stand-ards, and benchmarks in\ncommunication to the\nfundamental principles of\nbiology.\nPhilosophy of science,\nmore than anything else,\nis driving the field of\nsynthetic biology. It aims\nto correct longstanding\ndeficits obstructing the\nprogress of biology,\nnamely that it is \u2018hard to\nreplicate\u2019 and \u2018hard to\npredict\u2019. The idea is to\nbridge this fundamental\nlimitation in biology by\ncomplementing it with\ntools and principles of\nengineering which have\ndeveloped over a few centuries to be able accurately predict and replicate\nresults.\nThere are a number\nof enabling technologies\nwhich have made synthetic biology possible as\nwell as different from its\npredecessors. These technologies include automated DNA sequencing, rapid\nDNA synthesis, efficient\nDNA assembly, stochastic\n\u201cSynthetic\nbiology aims\nto complement\nbiology with\ntools and\nprinciples of\nengineering\u201d\n\u201cThe UK has\nbeen proactive\nabout being an\nintegral part of\nthe new field\u201d\nmodeling of biological\nprocesses, and rigorous\nstatistical inference.\nof synthetic biology have\nbeen employed by its\npredecessors, but only\npartially. What makes\nthis new prodigal child of\nbiotechnology different is\nthat it provides a unique\ninterface, encompassing\nall the enabling technologies together to focus on a\ncoherent purpose.\nSynthetic biology has\ndone more than just allow\nfor scientific progress: it\nhas succeeded in bringing\ntogether people from\ndiverse backgrounds like\nbiologists, engineers,\nmathematicians, computer\nscientists, policymakers,\nenvironmental activists,\nentrepreneurs, and inves-tors. This has brought a\ncascading effect resulting\ninto democratizing of\nbiotechnology. Many\n\u2018Do it Yourself Biology\u2019\nlabs have started to crop\nup across the world,\nincluding London, where\nscience enthusiasts are developing \u2018radioshack-like\nlaboratories\u2019 taking on\nopen problems. DIY\nbiology enthusiasts have\na more sophisticated term\nfor it: \u2018Bio-Hackerspace\u2019.\nThe name is inspired by\na hacking culture which\nbegan in silicon valley in\nthe early 1980s where the\nenthusiasts would tinker\nwith technology just to\npush its limits.\nThe growing hacker\nmovement has raised\nconcerns among public\nand policymakers alike.\nGiven even field-tested\nGMOs are viewed with\nsuspicion, the idea of an\namateur trying to modify\nbacteria to make it glow in\ndark instead of a flashlight\nis unpalatable to many.\nThese concerns have been\nacknowledged by many\nexperts in the first \u2018Synthetic Biology 1.0\u2019conference held at MIT, which\ndiscussed the risk, ethics,\nand intellectual property\nissues associated with this\nnew paradigm of biological engineering. However,\nthis conference coincided\nwith another event at MIT\nwhich has become the\nworld\u2019s largest movement\nspearheading synthetic\nbiology: International\nGenetic Engineering\nMachines competition or\niGEM.\niGEM is hosted every\nyear at MIT where\nteams across the world\nparticipate and present\ntheir project, built around\nsynthetic biology to\ntackle any open problem\nin biology. iGEM is immensely popular, with the\nnumber of participating\nteams increasing every\nyear. The first iteration\nof iGEM in 2004 saw\nonly five teams, but as of\n2017 more than 300 teams\nparticipated in this global\ncompetition.\nPerhaps the biggest\ndriver of iGEM\u2019s popularity is its emphasis on\nscience communication:\nteams have to build an\nextensive wiki to present\ntheir work with proper\ndocumentation of project\nidea, workflow, results,\nand a lab notebook for\nall future teams to take\nguidance from. Moreover,\nevery team has to do\npublic outreach, which\ninvolves organizing workshops and media outreach,\nconducting surveys, and\npromoting themselves\non social media. The\ntrack record of Imperial\nCollege has been very\nimpressive in iGEM; the\nteam won the grand prize\nin 2016 and came overall\nsecond in 2014, 2011 and\n2006. In a disruptive field\nwith no formal curriculum\niGEM has been a successful endeavor in providing\nyoung students with a\nholistic education about\nsynthetic biology.\nThe UK has been very\nproactive about being an\nintegral participant in the\nemerging global synthetic\nbiology scene, where the\nUS has been the predominant player. In 2012, the\nUK Research Council\nunveiled a roadmap for\nfuture with the ambition of\nmaking the UK a leader in\nsynthetic biology. Its key\nrecommendation included\ninvesting in a network of\nmultidisciplinary centers\nfor synthetic biology and\nfostering a skilled and\nwell-funded UK-wide\nsynthetic biology commu-nity.\nThese recommendations led to forming of a\nmulti-university initiative\nbringing together top five\nUK universities in synthetic biology \u2013 Imperial,\nCambridge, Edinburgh,\nKing\u2019s, and Newcastle \u2013\nto \u201cprovide critical mass\nand bring synergy\u201d in\nsynthetic biology devel-opment. While King\u2019s\nfocuses on the social and\nethical implications of\nsynthetic biology, the\nother four specialise in\nadvanced research.\nSynthetic biology is not\njust an evolution of a new\narea of research but also a\nsocietal and technological\nmovement strong enough\nto revolutionize how we\nas humans interact with\neach other and our envi-ronment. There is hope\nas well as concern over\nthe change that might\ncome, but all we can do is\nprepare for the changes.\nThe dawn of synthetic\nbiology is here.\nSynthetic biology is bringing together lots of different teams // CC\nSome ardent critics\nof synthetic biology\ncomplain the enabling\ntechnologies of synthetic\nbiology have been around\nfor many years, and the\nnew field is no more\nthan a rebranded form of\ngenetic engineering which\nprovides no additional\nutility beyond marketing\nto investors and funding\nagencies. To their credit,\nthey are partially right.\nAll objects in the toolkit\n\n"

The disused rail\nplatform, lying opposite\nthe District and Circle\nline platforms, has been\noccupied by a dizzying\narray of eggs: eggs\ncoming out of shower\nheads; eggs cracked open\nby nails; fried eggs lying\nflush against the floor of\nthe platform, as dark and\ngrimy as a used frying\npan. It\u2019s the project of\nHeather Phillipson, a\nBritish artist who works\nacross a wide range of\nmedia, constructing dense\ntapestries of meaning\nthat echo our hyperreal\nmodern life, in which\nwe are bombarded with\nvisual information from\nall sides.\nThe installation, my\nname is lettie eggsyrub,\ntakes up the entirety of\nthe 80m platform, and\nwill occupy the space for\nan entire year. Phillipson\ndescribes the project as \u201ca\nsubterranean disturbance,\nin which hyper-real,\ncreaturely simulations\nand analogue counterparts\ndwarf passengers,\u201d and\nwhile commuters aren\u2019t\nknown for being that\naware of the world around\nthem \u2013 London etiquette\ndemands a rigorous\nrefusal to focus anywhere\nexcept your feet/your\nphone/empty space \u2013 the\nsheer scale of Phillipson\u2019s\nwork makes it hard to\nignore.\nWhile the installation\nis new, the ethos behind\nit is not. Artists have been\nmaking use of Gloucester\nRoad station since 2003,\nwhen Cindy Sherman\nerected ten giant self-por-traits; Sherman\u2019s work\nplays with the question of\ngender and identity, with\nSherman donning nau-sea-inducing prosthetics\nto abstract herself into\nother personalities. Before\nPhillipson\u2019s work was\ninstalled, the arches of the\nplatform framed photographs by Trevor Paglen,\nlooking out over a bucolic\nEnglish landscape, whose\nhorizon was punctured\nby squat geodesic domes\nhousing US surveillance\nequipment.\nAll the projects that\nhave made use of the\nGloucester Road platform\nhave been organised by\nArt on the Underground,\na branch of Transport\nfor London (TFL) which\nuses the tube network as\na vast gallery space. The\nprogramme was originally called Platform for\nArt, and was founded in\n2000, acquiring its current\nname in 2007; it\u2019s headed\nup by a team of curators\nand producers, advised\nby a panel including those\nworking in the arts and\nwithin TFL, as well as\npracticing artists.\nSince its inception, the\nprogramme has allowed\nartists to create a number\nof significant works,\nand changed the way\ncommuters and tourists\nexperience the world\u2019s\noldest metro system. One\nof the most recognisable\nand frequently-changing\ninterventions is the cover\nof the tube map booklets,\nwhich can be picked up\nin the majority of station\nticket areas. Since 2003,\nthey have been inviting a\nrotating roster of artists to\ndesign the cover, drawing\non a range of influences,\nmost noticeably the\ndesign of the map itself.\nThe result is a series of\nartworks that, when collected together, function\nas a miniature exhibition;\nArt on the Underground\nhave commissioned some\nof the most influential\nartists working today, in-cludingRachelWhiteread,\nMona Hatoum, and Yayoi\nKusama, who have all\nbrought their artistic\ntrademarks \u2013 use of\nnegative space; textile\nhandiwork; psychedelic\ndots \u2013 to the iconic map.\nTaking inspiration from\nand drawing on the same\ntechniques Mughal artists\nused to produce exquisite\nminiatures, Qureshi said\nhis work would help\ncreate \u201ca completely new\natmosphere and a positive\nenergy,\u201d but it retains an\nunmistakable sense of\nviolence. The individual\nsegments of flora are surrounded by small splashes\n\u2013 the fly in the ointment\nthat calls to mind spots of\nblood, and unsettles the\ngentle image.\nAmerican artist Barbara\nKruger, whose work\ninterrogates the meaning\nof words and language,\nturned her attention to the\ntube map cover back in\n2010: her version takes\na selection of the map\naround Charing Cross,\nwhere the station names\nhave been replaced with\ntotemic values. Waterloo\nbecomes Vigilance;\nHolborn is renamed Joy;\nand Oxford Circus takes\non Perfection. The result\nis a witty visual puzzle,\nthat leads the viewer to\nmake links between the\ndifferent stations: you can\ntake a journey from Joy\nto Devotion to Compassion, for example, while\nBarbara Kruger\u2019s tube map cover // Art on the Underground\nI\u2019ve got a couple of\nfavourites from the series:\nfirstly, Imran Qureshi\u2019s All\nTime Would be Perpetual\nSpring, which sees the Pakistani-born artist drawing\ndelicate, beautiful floral\npatterns using the colours\nof underground tube lines.\nMark Wallinger\u2019s Labyrinth installation // Jack Gordon\niconic designs, and giant eggs invaders\u2026\n\u201cThe vision of\nthe London\nUnderground\nnetwork\nbranched into\nall areas of art\nand design\u201d\nFame abuts too close to\nPride for comfort. It is\nreminiscent of Simon\nPatterson\u2019s fantastic 1992\npiece The Great Bear,\nwhich saw the tube lines\nbecome categories of\nperson \u2013 philosophers,\nscientists, explorers \u2013 and\nthe stations individuals\nthrough history.\nOf course, all these\nworks are themselves\ndrawing upon an iconic\npiece of urban design: the\ntube map itself. It can be\ndifficult to imagine the\ntube map looking like\nanything other than our\ncurrent design, but from\nthe foundation of the underground through to the\n1930s, transit authorities\nmade use of a geographi-cally-accurate map, which\nresulted in a massive\ncrush in the centre, tube\nlines wriggling over each\nother like vipers, while\nsuburban lines stretched\nout into emptiness.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1931\nthat things started to get\ncleaned up. Harry Beck,\nan engineering draftsman\nin the London Underground Signals Office,\nrealised commuters\ndidn\u2019t necessarily care\nabout where the stations\nwere in proximity to one\nanother since they\u2019d be\ntravelling underground,\nlosing their sense of\ndirection \u2013 instead, they\nneeded a simple topological map, which would\ntell them how to get from\none station to another,\nand where they needed\nto change lines. Taking\ninspiration from electrical\ncircuit diagrams, Beck\nspaced out the stations so\nthey were equally distant\napart, and used only 90 or\n45 degree angles within\nthe diagram. The first\nmap, finished in 1931, has\na strong resemblance to\nthe modern map we know\ntoday \u2013 it was easy to read,\nthe extra details had been\nremoved, and the lines\nhad an identifiable colour.\nOriginally rejected,\nBeck returned to the\ndrawing board, making\nsmall changes to the\ndesign, and submitting\nit again the next year;\nthis time the authorities\ntentatively went for it,\npaying Beck \u00a310 for the\ndesign, and producing a\nsmall run of maps, which\nwere immediately popular\namong the general public.\nOver the next thirty years\nBeck produced maps for\nthe London Underground,\nwhich gradually increased\nin complexity as more\nlines were added, until\nan uncredited design led\nBeck and his employers to\nfall out; Beck continued\nto produce maps in his\nown spare time, but none\nwere produced, and he\ndied in 1974, at the age of\n72. It wasn\u2019t until 1997,\nmore than two decades\nafter his death, that his\ncontribution was formally\nrecognised on current\nmaps. Hugely influential,\nthe London Underground\nmap is a work of art in\nits own right, one that has\nbeen emulated by underground networks across\nthe world.\nThe tube map is just\none example of the unified\nvision of the London\nUnderground network,\nwhich branched into all\nareas of art and design.\nThis unique aspect of the\ntransport network can be\ntraced back to Frank Pick,\nwho started as publicity\nofficer for the Underground Electric Railways\nCompany of London\n(UERL), a precursor of\nthe London Underground,\nbefore becoming its\nmanaging director.\nPick introduced a\nnumber of key design\nelements that would\nbecome emblematic of\nthe tube, including the\niconic roundel \u2013 the red\nring struck through with\na blue bar \u2013 which he had\nEdward Johnston develop\nfrom the previous clunky\ndesign of a solid red\ncircle in 1913. Pick also\ncommissioned Johnston\nto develop a signature\nfont for the UERL to\nuse, giving them a clear\nbrand identity. The result,\nJohnston, was instantly\nrevolutionary: one of the\nfirst humanist san-serif\ntypefaces, it would later\ngo on to inspire other de-signers, such as Eric Gill\nand Frederic Goudy, and\ncan be seen as a precursor\nto fonts such as Tahoma or\nCalibri.\nPick\u2019s influence didn\u2019t\njust extend to visual\ndesign, however \u2013 he\nwas also commissioned\narchitect Charles Holden\nto design a number of underground stations, many\nof which remain iconic\nto this day. While other\ntransit systems, such as\nParis\u2019 M\u00e9tro, were largely\nbuilt within a compressed\ntime frame, the London\nUnderground was completed over a number\nof decades, as new\ngenerations and shifting\ndemographics demanded\nmore lines to be opened;\nthe result is a panoply of\nstation design, where a\nsingle train journey could\ntake you from Italinante,\nto art deco, to high-tech.\nIn total 71 stations\nhave buildings which are\nlisted, while a number of\nothers have entrances or\nexits within other listed\nbuildings. Holden\u2019s\ndesigns, many of which\nare themselves listed, are\namong the most iconic \u2013\nalthough Leslie Green\u2019s\nbeautiful oxblood tile-clad\ndesigns (see Gloucester\nRoad station) come a\nclose second. Holden\u2019s\nwork comes in two\nmain flavours: the first\ncan be seen in the 1926\nextension to the Northern\nLine, with huge plate\nglass murals featuring\nthe Roundel embedded\nwithin a Portland stone\nfacade, and a long awning\nover the entranceway;\nthe second is found in\nthe later Piccadilly Line\nextension, with stations\nmade of a series of interlocking shapes \u2013 spheres,\ncylinders, cuboids \u2013 that\nwould extend horizontally and vertically. Of\nthese, perhaps the most\nimpressive is Southgate\nstation: circular in its\ndesign, it seems to have\ncrashed down on the\nNorth London suburb like\na UFO, an allusion aided\nby the Tesla-coil-esque\nstatue planted on top.\nAt the centre of Pick\u2019s\nmission was a desire to\nbring good design to the\naverage citizen, a project\nthat Art on the Underground keeps up to this\nday.The variety of the tube\nnetwork was celebrated in\n2013, during its 150th\nan-niversary, with Labyrinth,\nan installation by Mark\nWallinger, which takes\nthe form of 270 unique\nblack and white maze\ntiles, with one installed at\neach station. In July 2016,\nless than a month after\nthe Brexit vote, Art on the\nUnderground launched\ntheir #LondonIsOpen\nseries, which invited\nartists to create works\ncelebrating diversity and\ninclusion showing how\nLondon would remain a\nglobal city, regardless of\nthe political climate.\nSome may balk at a\npublic institution making\na political point in such\na way, but the history of\nthe London Underground\nnetwork shows it has\nalways been a quietly\nradical force. Anything\nthat brings art down\nfrom the gallery space,\nand into the realm of\npeople\u2019s lives, allowing\nit to become part of their\neveryday environment,\nis in itself political. And\nso, if you happen to go\nthrough Gloucester Road\nstation within the next\nyear, make sure to check\nout Heather Phillipson\u2019s\neggs, and think about how\nit\u2019s just another step in\none of the largest public\nart projects to have ever\nexisted.\nYou can\u2019t make an omelette\u2026 // GG Archard\n\n"

Try putting on some\nambient music\nNew research highlights the way what we listen to can influence what we eat, with relaxing music making us\nmore likely to pick healthy options.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nW\nhen choosing our\nfood, our\nconscious\nself is never in full control\n\u2013 I always let my cravings\nget the best of me. For in-stance, when I am sad I eat\nice-cream; when I smell\na pizza, I will instantly\nwant to eat one. But have\nyou ever considered how\nour hearing can impact on\nfood choices?\nIn London, there are\napproximately 39,000\nfood service establish-ments. In order to compete\nwith other restaurants,\nstore managers will use\ndifferent sensory cues to\nlure us into consuming\ntheir food. Bakeries, for\nexample, pump out the\nsmell of freshly baked\nbread to attract customers,\nwhile some stores play the\nUK top 40 to make themselves more appealing to a\nyounger age group. This\ninfluence also extends to\nmusic and background\nnoise, with both genre and\nvolume having an impact\non our appetite and food\nchoice.\nA study published in\nlate April by Professor\nDipayan Biswas and\ncollaborators has demonstrated how music can\ninfluence our choice of\neating either healthy or\nunhealthy food. Their\nhypothesis was based\non previous findings in\ndifferent studies: our\nperception of taste can\nbe modified via ambient\nmusic; in a noisy environment our perception\nof sweetness and saltiness\ndecreases while the\ncrunchiness of food is\nenriched. Other studies\nhave shown emotional\nconnection to background\nmusic can also affect how\none evaluates wine. These\nexamples goes on, but no\none has studied the effect\nof music on our choice of\nfood until now.\n\u201cHigher\nmusic volume\ncan elicit\nexcitement,\nleading us\nto choose\nunhealthy\nfood\u201d\n\u201cThe definition\nof\u2018high\nvolume\u2019used\nin the study\nis itself quite\nobscure and\nsubjective\u201d\nFrom these results, the\nresearchers hypothesised\nthat music can impact on\nour mood: higher music\nvolume (e.g. club music)\ncan elicit excitement,\nleading us to choose high\nenergy and unhealthy\nfood, since these fatty\nfoods help reduce stress\nand high level of excite-ment. Vice versa, music\nthat prompts us to relax\nmay help us to make\nhealthier food choices, as\nwe gain better control of\nourselves. This effect is\ndemonstrated by mindfulness exercises that emotional eaters implement\nto help them lose weight,\nwith a study finding that\nindividuals who practice\nrelaxation exercises have\ngreater control in food\nconsumption.\nTesting this in the\nlaboratory, supermarkets\nand cafes, results showed\nbackground music has an\neffect on our emotional\nstate, as reflected by heart\nrate.Amore relaxed mind-state, as indicated by a\nlower heart rate, is linked\nto an increased preference\nfor healthy food. In the\nexperiments conducted\nin both supermarkets and\ncaf\u00e9s, low volumes of\nmusic and background\nnoise correlate with increased sales of healthy\nfood, regardless of the\ngenre of music, implicating how subconscious\ncues can trigger consumption of food.\nTranslating this knowledge into real-life applica-tions, perhaps restaurants\nthat sell healthy food\nmay want to have gentle,\nquiet music floating in the\nbackground, while fast\nfood chains can turn up\nthe volume to boost sales.\nOther business strategies\ncould also be modified\naccordingly using the\nresults of this study: when\ndesigning menus for a\nstall in a noisy setting,\nsuch as a food market,\nthey should focus more on\nselling unhealthy food, as\nconsumers are more likely\nto purchase such items in\nthis setting. Just imagine\nhow likely you are to\nchoose a burger over a\nsalad in Borough Market!\nThis can even be\nextended to the design\nof the market or malls,\nas building walls can\nbe designed to absorb\nsound to create a tranquil\nenvironment, or walls\ncan even be put between\nsub-departments to allow\ndifferent volumes or\ngenres to be played in\ndifferent areas.\nAs for us, if we want\nto purchase and consume\nhealthy food, perhaps we\ncan plug in our calming\nmusic when we are going\nfor our grocery shop, so\nwe won\u2019t \u2018accidentally\u2019\nbring home the whole\nsnack aisle. Otherwise,\nwe could choose to dine\nin places with a lower\nvolume of background\nnoise, therefore reducing\nsubconscious cues to\nbinge eat highly calorific\nfood.\nan optimal music volume.\nFor example, I turn my\nmusic up so loud that you\ncan hear it through my\nearphones, and I find that\n\u2018just right\u2019. My roommate\ndisagrees, as she thinks\na silent environment\nmore relaxing. Using\nthis example, it is clear\nthe definition of \u2018high\nvolume\u2019 itself is quite\nobscure, and some individuals might find loud\nmusic more relaxing than\nquiet background noise.\nFurthermore, background\nnoises \u2013 people chatting,\nglasses clinking, intercoms \u2013 cannot be controlled in real life situation\nsuch as in a supermarket\nor a caf\u00e9, rendering\nthese finding limited to\nindividual context.

This does not\nhave to be as drastic as\ngoing vegetarian, but\ncan be very simple. I\nhave listed a few ways\nbelow that I would like\nyou to consider.\nAs we have all seen\nin recent times, plastics\nare a big problem for the\nenvironment, and it is important that we reduce our\nconsumption. To do this\nwhen visiting pubs and\nclubs, do not use straws\nunless the establishment\nhas biodegradable or\nplastic alternatives.\nLikewise, when buying\nbottled drinks, try to avoid\nones in plastic packaging,\nor make sure you recycle\nyour bottles afterwards\nif you cannot.

Not only will you be\nsaving the environment,\nbut many coffee shops\nalso offer discounts to\nthose customers that do.\nAll of these small changes\ndo add up, and once you\nbecome aware of the\nother alternatives you can\nuse, you can significantly\nreduce the amount of\nsingle-use plastic you use\nand dispose of.\nyou can volunteer your\ntime with your favourite\nanimals! This has benefits\non both sides: not only\nwill you be directly contributing to conservation,\nbut it can also help your\nwellbeing.

You\nnever know, you may\ndiscover a new passion\nthat drives you to help\nsafeguard a specific part\nthe natural world.\nReducing plastic use is important in safeguarding our oceans // Wikimedia\nConnect with Conservation: how we can all help\nCould platypus milk help beat antibiotic resistance?\nI\nn 2014, the World\nHealth Organisation\nwarned the international community\nof the threat of antibiotic\nresistance. Due to an excessive use of antibiotics\n\u2013 mostly fed to food-pro-ducing animals \u2013 bacteria\nare able to develop re-sistance, which they then\ntransmit to the next generation of bugs, who can no\nlonger be killed by available pharmaceuticals. As\na result, diseases which\nhave been treatable for\nyears, thanks toAlexander\nFleming\u2019s discovery, are\nonce again responsible for\nmany deaths \u2013 killing approximately 5000 people\nin the UK each year.\nIn this critical situation,\nhope arises from new\nresearch being carried\nout on species which\npreviously had no funding\ndue to their insignificance.\nAustralia\u2019s wildlife is one\nof the areas of interest. A\nprotein in platypus milk\nwas found to have antibacterial properties by a team\nof Australian scientists\nfrom Deakin University,\nVictoria, in 2010. A recent\npaper published by Dr\nJanet Newman, from Australia\u2019s national science\nagency CSIRO, identifies\nthe functional groups of\nthis protein enabling it to\ncombat superbugs.\nAs indicated by crys-tallisation, the molecule\nis unique, and presents no\nsimilarity with any other\nknown protein. ConseSCIENCE\nMarie Jones\nScience Writer\ntwo mammals on earth\nwhich lay eggs. They\nare considered mammals\nbecause they feed their\nbabies with milk similar\nto cows or humans. What\ncould then explain their\nlactating proteins contain\nsuch antibiotic? Like\nno other mammals, the\nmonotremes are unable to\nbreastfeed their progen-iture; instead they sweat\nmilk, which is exposed\nto the outside environment and thus has the\nsusceptibility of possibly\nbecoming contaminated.\nThis evolution of the\nplatypus may be its defensive response for a safe\nand sterile delivery system\nof milk in order to protect\nthe young from possible\ninfection. The particular fold of the protein\nexplains its \u201cantibacterial\nproperties against some of\nthe nastier bugs you find\nin the environment but\nnot against some bacteria\nfound in the guts of the\nyoung\u201d, Newman reports,\nafter observing the\nmolecule killing bacteria\nsuch as Staphylococcus\naureus and Enterococcus\nfaecalis.\nEven though the\nplatypus milk could lead\nto the creation of new antibiotic treatment against\nsuperbugs, drug discovery\nwilltakealongtimebefore\npatients are offered new\npharmaceuticals. Thus, it\nis still crucial to counter\nbacterial resistance to antibiotics by reducing the\nmassive use of antibiotics\nworldwide. The promise\nof innovative antibiotics\nbeing developed against\nsuperbugs is a relief in\nthe eventuality of a future\n\u2018post-antibiotics era,\u2019 but\nshould not be taken for\ngranted, as research is still\nrequired to understand\nthe protein\u2019s interactions\nbefore it can be commercialised as a treatment.\nWhat are those? // Wikimedia\nquently, this constitutes a\nnew field for researchers\nand scientist to explore!\nThe monotreme lactation protein (MLP)\nincludes a monomer\nof twelve helices, two\nshort \u03b2-strands, and a\ndeep fold which gives it\nthe nickname \u201cShirley\nTemple,\u201d after the famous\nAmerican child star\nwith curly hair from the\n1930s. This discovery\nreinforces Newman\u2019s\nbelief that monotremes\nmay be an unexploited\nsource for identification\nof new proteins, with\ninteresting properties such\nas antimicrobial activity.\nDr Newman was not\noverly surprised by this\nas she states: \u201cPlatypus\nare such weird animals\nthat it would make sense\nfor them to have weird\nbiochemistry\u201d.\nO r n i t h o r h y n c h u s\nanatinus and echidnas\nare indeed the only\n\u201cIt is important\nwe all\nreduce our\nconsumption\nof plastic\u201d\nSomething else we can\nall do to help the natural\nworld is get involved in\none way or another.
