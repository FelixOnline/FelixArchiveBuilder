    "content": "23 June 1999\nReviews\nFilm 25\nPlace Vendome * *\nStarring : Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle Seigner, Jacques Dutronc\nDirector: Nicole Garcia\nA sad shadow of a woman drowning in the throes of desperate\nalcoholism? Nope, not Jennifer\nLopez after tragically failing to break into\nFHM's Top 10 Sexiest Women. Nope,\nnot Radio 2's Sarah Kennedy either.\nWell, who then? Marianne Malivert,\nthat's who. Place Vendome pivots\naround the character portrayed by\nCatherine Deneuve, best known for her\npart as a young siren in the late sixties\nfilm Belle} Du Jour. Sparked back into\nreality by her husband's death, she goes\nagainst the wishes of her relatives and\ntakes up the reigns of the jewell ry trade.\nWhat we have here is essentially a one woman show. Other characters are\nmerely tools to bring out more depth in\nthe interpretation of Marianne. The\nyoung, beautiful and talented jeweller,\nNathalie, employed by her husband, is an\necho of her own youth. The mysterious\nJean-Pierre, who seems to keep cropping up whenever she's on business,\nhighlights both her insecurity and her\ndetermination. In fact, she doggedly\nrefuses to take the advice of any of her\nold friends, leading her into a world populated by the Russian mafia and a former\nNot bad for a56 year-old.\nlover who betrayed her love for him in\nthe now distant past.\nDespite a synopsis that sounds\nintriguing and dark, the film never really\ngrabs and keeps your attention. Don't get me wrong. Deneuve is superb and\nhighly believable as the heroine of this\nstory. It's just that no sympathy is really\ngenerated for the character. At the end,\nI didn't care whether she came out on\ntop or not. The whole film seemed to\nlack any pace. Perhaps the French like to\nlinger over near-silent scenes for minutes\non end before ending it with a pseudo-cryptic line. However, this approach does\nnot lift up my skirt. It stifles the atmosphere. It clogs up the story-telling art er ies. It leaves me frustrated and ultimately\nunsympathetic towards the lead chara c ter. Vendome is an Intense and complex\nfilm, but it lacks the punch that could turn\nit into a top notch suspense thriller. Channel Five beckons. Q Dennis\nCroupier * \u2022 *\nStarring : Clive Owen, Kate Hardie, Alex Kingston, Gina McKee\nDirector: Mike Hodges\nIn attempting to recapture the mastery of the stylised slow-burning\nthriller which made him famous,\nMike Hodges has produced a sadly hit-and-miss movie. Whilst Croupier has\noccasional moments of charm, it's embedded within a distinctly ethereal\natmosphere which certainly won't correspond to any London you're familiar\nwith.\nThe problem, I suppose, is that\nHodges wants to recapture his own heyday, which came in the form of\n1971s Get Carter (although some would undoubtedly argue in favour of\nkitsch classic Flash Cordon) - and that\nkind of movie simply doesn't work in a modern day setting. Consequently, he\ntries to manufacture a stylised vision of\nLondon by basing the action around a casino, where struggling writer Owen\nfinds a job. Irritatingly moralistic, he\nrefuses to gamble himself, however,\nand instead gets his thrills by jumping\ninto bed with every woman he meets,\nThe atmosphere became tense at the World Snap Championships.\nbefore getting involved with some local\ngangsters who want to rob his place of\nwork. However, whilst the scenes based\naround the casino are tensely observed,\nthe sexual encounters are unconvincing\nand the local gangsters are simply\nham my. Worst of all, however, Is\nOwen's internal monologue - it's obvious why he remains a struggling writer\nif his clich e ridden thoughts are anything to go by. Q Dave\nPDATE\nThe Mask of\nzorro\nThe late nineties may not have produced many great movies, but they can\nat least take a little credit for opening out\nthe action genre to more than just the\nguns 'n' ammo brigade. Integral to this\nchange are movies like The Mask of\nZorro, which ditches big explosions and\nhigh-tech wizardry in favour of style and\nentertainment. Antonio Banderas is the\nyoung pretender to the black hat and\nmask, whilst Anthony Hopkins is the\noriginal Zorro, charged with teaching\nhis young protege the art of swordplay\nand the triple-swoosh trademark. Add\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Ooldeneye\ndirector Martin Campbell into the mix\nand you're left with near perfect enter-tain ment. Brilliant.\nPI\nBleak, dark and almost irritatingly gothic,\nPI is a strong contender for one of the\nyear's weirdest movies to date, complete with de rig eur nightmarish, ultra-paranoid visions of a technocrat's world\ngone mad. The intricate black-and-white\nphotography is effective, and the end\nresult chilling ly clever, but it's still a little\nshort on ideas, meaning that writer/\ndirector Darren Aronovsky is clearly at full\nstretch to fill the minimal eighty minute\nrunning time. Nonetheless, considering\nthis is his debut feature, it's still damn\nimpressive stuff - and it's a shame that\nyou know that he'll never make it into\nthe big-time if he continues to make\nmovies like this.\nHope Floats\nSandra Bullock should definitely employ\nsomeone else to pick her movies for\nher. OK, so if you view acting as a job\nthen I guess you should simply take\nwhatever parts you're offered, but even\nso you have to draw the line somewhere - and clearly Ms Bullock draws\nhers far too close to the bottom of the\nbarrel. Hope Floats is a fine example of\nsuch random choices; attempting to\nfeed her core audience, she picks a slushy, low-concept rom-com, co-staring\nHarry Connick Jr. Consequently, we're\nleft with yet another movie which isn't so much bad as depressing. For hardcore fans only.\nDave\n\n"

    "content": "10 23 June 1999\nThe Last Word From\nThe Last Goodbye\nW ell, this really is it. I know I have had more\nfarewells than Sinatra, and have invariably\ninvoked the great man's lyrics on each\noccasion, but this is absolutely the last Voice of Reason. You will therefore forgive the odd smidgen of\nself-indulgence. Before I start thanking the cast of\nthousands that have made all this possible, it seems\na good time to explain how it all started, since, if I had a pound for every time somebody asked me, I would have enough for a loaf in Southside shop,\nand that's a lot of dough. It all started in the autumn\nof 1994. Though I had had a couple of letters in Felix\nin the previous year, more of which later, it was the\nFrater Fiam column that led to my first real rant. Written by Felix luminary Marcus Alexander, I, in my\nhumble opinion, saw it as nothing more than vacuous drivel (no sniggering at the back, please).\nThis I detailed in a couple of letters, which caught\nthe eye of the then News Editor, Rachel Walters. She\nwent on to be the 1995/6 editor, and asked if I wished to write a column on anything and every-thing. The rest, as they say is history. Initially\nintended to be a fortnightly feature, it ran weekly\nfor three years, becoming larger this year and interwoven with my good friend Matthew Salter's Right\nAngles to Reality.\nIt all began on October 13 199S with a piece\nabout French nuclear testing in the Pacific, in which\nI suggested an alternative, deserted test site could\nbe EuroDisney, and a moan about the no-smoking\npolicy in the JCR, which people were beginning to\nenforce by the installation of about 50 red and white signs. In those halcyon days, I knew virtually\nnothing about Sherfield. Messrs Caldwell, Hansen,\nFoster, McClure and Sir Ron were mere entries in the\nphone book, so it took a while for me to get into\nmy stride, confining myself to the weird ministrations of student politics. Ian Caldwell, later to\nbecome a star feature in my column, first got a mention in the middle of January 1996. The subject?\nSigns. What else, dear reader, could it be? The biggest thing in common between me and Caldwell\nIs signage. He loves putting 'em up, I love s lagging 'em off. The absolute pinnacle of Estates' achievements still remains the 'This is a Temporary Gate'\nsign betwixt the Central Library and Biochemistry. I hope the promise of one of them still stands...\nBeyond Year Zero\n\u2022 n what was to become a regular feature, my job\nI was in jeopardy for the following year, but fran-I tic negotiation with Alex fe a kes( I grovelled)\nsecured my position. Campus Renaissance was well\non its way, though not with out a few glitches: BMS\ncranes crashing into buildings, bulldozers nearly\nfalling through the Library roof, that sort of thing.\nClayponds was a bit of a hot issue that year, on account of a very large spate of burglaries and an\neven larger number of breath tak ln gly crass comments from College. Somebody suggested that \"IC\nadmin v students [is not] an equal contest\". I could-n't agree more. Sherfield don't stand a chance. Of course, I don't just slag off IC's legions of administrators. The European Union has also been the subject of many a rant over the years. In November\n1996 I said, \"how on earth can the Deutschmark\nretain all its value after 1999?\" Now I'm not one to\ncrow, but...\nYou will know by now my views on alcohol. I am\nbroadly of the opinion that the beer In Southside is\na little ahead of the Union in much the same way\nthat a ferrari is a slightly sassier motor than a fiat\n126. This caused a bit of a storm in early 1997. Censored by the then editor, I can now reveal that I meant to say, \"if you think real ale is synonymous\nwith amorous activities in a canoe, leave the Union\nBar and head for Princes Gardens.\" The point still\nstands, though I must say I had a half decent pint\nof 6X there recently. Much still needs to be done,\nhowever.\nMany people wrongly assume that I have a major problem with ICU, which is of course a load\nof old cobblers. I may have given this impression\nwhen I was cruelly misinterpreted over the legitimacy of hockey bar names (a tremendous in ven tion), and my views on PoetlC's Weekly Poem, which\nvied for space with my humble prose. Poets, being\ngentle folk, don't go round slapping people, so\nthey wrote 'An Ode to Simon Baker.' I would quote\nit, but my copy of that issue has disappeared. The\nboss of that society, who I attacked on several\noccasions, was some blok e called Ed Sexton. Whatever happened to him?\nThe Best of Times\nI shan't continue to list all the times I offended\nsomeone important that year, but I must recount\nthe Great Marquee Debacle. For the benefit of\nyounger readers and those old lags who don't now\nknow what day of the week it is, Imperial College\ndecided that undergraduates should not sit their\nsummer exams in the Great Hall, but rather in a very\nlarge tent in Princes Gardens. The reason for this\nwas the startling discovery, just before the scheduled exams, that knocking seven bells out of the\nadjoining library might generate a bit of noise.\nThat's why we pay our senior people all that money,\nyou see. It turned out that the builders' request for\nan exam timetable went unheeded, leading to this\ncrazy situation, which made it as far as The Independent, if I remember correctly. Let's just say that\n1996/97 was a good year for a columnist at IC.\nMy employment secured again at the eleventh\nhour from Jeremy Thompson,1997/98 began with\na new photo for me, replacing the one that actually made me look reasonably good with one that\nlooked like Stevie Wonder had been conducting\nmicro re constructive facial surgery with a blow lamp and a lump hammer. Having decried the 'motley\ncrews' and Schal project mismanage rs,I finally\nentered the lion's den and went 'on site'. Thoroughly nice chaps, I was a bit unnerved when a seven foot Irishman said that he was not happy\nabout the motley bit. A pathetic half-laugh on my\npart and it was exit stage left. One of the biggest\nissues of the year was the Conference Office. I must be careful here, for reasons that will soon\nbecome clear, but they started off by 'mastermind-ing' the fond on Fashion Week extravaganza.\nThrough incompetence that would have been dismissed as unrealistic on the pages of a 'Yes, Prime\nMiniste' script, the College barely made a profit\nout an event that caused untold chaos to the centre of the South Ken campus. Of course, it wasn't all doom and gloom as Ken Weir, Security supremo,\nwill tell you to this day. Despite the fact that I missed the whole week, I'm not bitter. I never did\nrate Helena Christensen anyway. Ken.\nThe Long Arm of the Law\nThings went from bad to worse on the Conference front. \u00a38,000 was lavished on 13 office\nchairs (I always said that Chippendale and grey\nFormica would clash, but would they listen?). And\nthen the b iggy. As had become a trend by this\nstage, my famously sharp hearing had picked up a discussion of the Conferencing trading accounts on\nthe Walkway. Alas, a few errors crept into a news\nitem (not my column, mind), prompting the threat\n23 June 1999 11\nThe Voice of Reason\nof legal action by the inestimable Annette De fim a, Head of the Conference Office. Ulitmately, no\naction was taken, for which there are two explanations. Was It the inexorable flow of the milk of\nhuman kindness from that department, or could it\nhave been the discovery that, as ICU is not a separate body from Imperial College, a lawsuit would\nhave roped in the Rector and the Chairman of the\nGoverning Body? To this day, it's a mystery.\n1997 will be remembered by many as the year\nwhen ICU held more elections than Italy. The sterling Eric Allsop proved a hard act to follow, resulting in four rounds before Andy Heeps successfully\ntook the reins. Along the way we saw some candidates of execrable ability, desperately trying to bolster crappy CVs, a trend which I'm glad to say seems\nto have reduced of late. All in all it was a busy year,\nwith a huge number of different bits and pieces. In\nshort, I managed to offend the following groups:\nThird World First, the Overseas Students Committee,\nThe CCUs (all of them), the Hockey team again\n(honest, lads, it was all a misunderstanding) and the\nmedics. Having said that, Nick Newton of ICSM\nannoyed me not in considerably, so I suppose it's honours even.\nI also managed to offend large sections of the\nmodern 'art' community, and a Pro-Rector to boot.\nI wrote a lengthy diatribe on an exhibition hosted\nin the Ante Room in November 1997. \"While I have\nno desire to meet the two talent less cretins responsible for this utter waste of taxpayers' money, I would dearly love to meet the person that wrote the\nbiographical sketches of these creative non-entities.\nTo describe a video of a few peas and model sheep\nvibrating on a washing machine as 'immensely\nfunny' indicates that he or she is peerless ly ironic\nor deeply disturbed (or the recipient of a back-han-der).\" As anyone who saw it will agree, this is fair\ncomment. Unfortunately, this was unwittingly published two days after a Sherfield Council of War met\nto discuss the semi-destruction of said 'installation\nart.1\nBy an amazing and untimely coincidence, the\ndamage occurred at the same time as a'22 Club ball,\nat which I was Club President. This irony was not lost\non many senior College staff, with the odd Pro-Rectoral exception. And no, it was not me.\nbetter judgement, Alex Feakes, Jeremy Thompson\nand Ed let me continue - Cheers!\nPeople less grateful are Ian Caldwell, Mike\nHansen, Marion Kimberly, Vernon McClure, Lynda\nDavis and John Foster. Amazingly, Ian, when we\nfinally met on St Patrick's Day 1997, resisted the urge\nto lamp me, instead, if I remember correctly, buying me a pint of Guinness. I think we were both surprised that the other was a human being, and later\nthat year became quite close - he was on one side\nof a full colour poster and I was on the other. Mike\nHansen, whose capacity for beer and jalape no chillies is more than respectable, first tackled me over\nallegations of chess playing within Finance. I think\nthat was eventually a draw -1 was slightly incorrect,\nIll ill \u2022 \u2022\n:\n\u2022 ' 111 . 1;\n'. 1\n!!\u2022 1\ni!i111., \u2022\n: li!:::*A Final Thank You...\nA nd so we come to this year, under the stewardship of the esteemed Ed Sexton, who again succumbed to my charm and grovelling.\nNo need to review it, because someone will have\ndone that elsewhere. It is therefore time to start\nthanking people. Firstly, John 'Hamish' Teale. As\nwell as persuading me to send my first letter into\nFelix, he came up with the column's name. On the\nsubject, thanks to Beccy Land. If you hadn't made\nsuch a mess of running Felix in 1993/4,1 would probably never done any of this. Rachel Walters holds the\nfearsome responsibility of letting me do this originally, for which I am eternally grateful. Against their\nand went on to appear on a Level 4 dartboard.\nMarion very nearly took me to task over several com-ment s, but thought discretion to be the better part\nof valour. Having had a chance to refine my op in ion, I can say that the Personnel Division is safe in\nher hands. Pint glasses are a different matter... Vernon McClure, with whom I have yet to quaff an ale,\ntook offence at the suggestion that the Registry was\nthe size of Wembley Arena, staffed with a capacity\ncrowd. Thankfully, he didn't take this too badly,\nhence the fact that I was allowed to stay on for a PhD. Lynda and John are also mere faces on the\nwalkway, having never met either of them. Though\nwe have had numerous disagreements, they have\nalways been professionally courteous; fy nda has\nnever s lagged me off in IC Distorter and College\nCatering have never poisoned me. Well, there was\nthat meat pie in the SCR once, but I digress.\nI must thank the Rector, Lord Oxburgh (con-gr atul at ions, Ron, I promised I'd put in a good\nword, didn'tI?), for allowing me to continue my stud-ies, when many would have slung me out for being\nlip py years ago. Thanks also to the College Secretary, Tony Mitcheson. Though I'm sure he has done\nmuch else, he is responsible for the flying of flags.\nNot a single day is missed, a testament to his military training I assume. When the Union Flag\nappeared recently for the Duke of Edinburgh's birth-day, I nearly rushed over to Suite Five to buy you a drink. Marvellous.\nA huge number of people are guilty of aiding\nand abetting this column, but I shall single out a few. As you know, the very highest journalistic standards are maintained in this column (sometimes).\nThanks therefore to all the people with whom I have\nlived or worked, roped into reading through the raw\ntext. Additionally, Prof David Good gam c in my own\ndepartment, who has given frequent and detailed\ncritiques of my spelling, some of which I hope I have\ntaken on board - I hope I 've finally got it right! All\nwork and no play makes Jack a dull boy - you've got\nto eat and drink This column and degree and PhD\nwould not have been possible without the constant and dependable source of liquid refreshment\nthat is Southside Bar. Roger and his superb staff\nhave, over the years, consistently served perfect real\nale, during the consumption of which most of the\nideas that I have used came to the fore. They have\njust received the Cask Marque in recognition of the\nexcellent standard of beer served, which is very\nrichly deserved. This column's finishing, but I 'll still\nprop up your bar. My lunch tl mes for the last three\nyears have mostly been in the excellent and unsung\nHolland Club, under the excellent stewardship of\nKev and his fine team. Coming off brie, bacon and\nwalnut jacket potatoes was not easy, but after that\nstint at the Betty Ford Clinic, I can now vary the\ndishes with impunity. A great venue, and one that\ncould teach other outlets on campus a thing or two.\nFinally, there are a number of people that I would\ntruly love to thank. Unfortunately, they would probably face the firing squad if their names ever\nappeared in print. You know who you are, and I am\nimmensely grateful. The students and many of the\nstaff owe you all a great debt of gratitude for helping to hold to account people, policies and departments at Imperial.\n...and Goodnight\nA nd so the end is nigh. I have enormously\nenjoyed doing this for the last four years, and\nhope that some of you found something in it\nto amuse, entertain, inform or infuriate. Some of\nyou must have, because this column generated\nmore than its fair share of letters, even ones that\nsaid nice things. I better stop before the upper lip\nstarts to quiver. Goodnight and God Bless.\n\n"

    "content": "1 2 /\n^ J H \u00ab ^ 23 June 1999\nRight Angles to the Rising Sun\nLaw and Order in a crime-free land\nT hey say the strangest things... If\nRoger Whittaker, that great social\nvisionary and legendary MOR bal-la deer, is to be believed, not only does\nEngland \"swing like a pendulum do\"\nbut we also have \"Bobbies on bicycles\ntwo by two\". Hmmm. Perhaps when\nGranny was a little girl, but these days it's more a case of Kevlar body armour and\nrapid response vehicles, so I'm told; but\none thing's for sure - officers of the law\nnever go abroad without at least one of\ntheir pals in tow. But it's a comforting\nand cosy thought, isn't it? The image of\nkindly Dixon of Dock Green with his\nbend y kneed \"even in' all\" is as much\npart of British consciousness as warm\nbeer, overpriced hotels and losing to\nArgentina in the World Cup. It's perhaps\nno surprise then that we are unwilling\nto face up to the fact that it's about as\nrealistic a picture of modern society as\nporridge is of 'oat' cuisine. Sadly, in the\nlast few years the image of the police\nforce, as well as an alarming number of\npersons in their custody, has taken a severe battering. I 've lost count of how\nmany convictions have recently been\noverturned on appeal as being \"unsafe\nand unsatisfactory\", let alone those\ncases that have gone by the board\nbecause of some technical irregularity.\nWhilst some of those\nwho have been set\nfree should probably\nstill be languishing at\nHer Majesty's plea-sure, the fact that a fair few of them are\nworthy of being given\nthe benefit of the\ndoubt is more than a little worrying. But\nlet's not be too hard\non our boys in blue.\nThey do a nigh-Impossible job under\nimmensely trying and stressful conditions, normally only experienced by us\ncivilians when watching a feature-length\nepisode of Little House on the Prairie.\nMuch-trumpeted 'loss of respect for\nauthority', helmets that look like ladies'\nbosoms and alleged chronic under-manning have all taken their toll on\npolice morale. This last point is a particularly sensitive one - a recent report\nunearthed the disturbing finding that\nsome UK Metropolitan forces are so\nshort-staffed that increasingly suspects\nare having to write their own confessions. It's easy to forget in the enlightened days in which we live that the\npolice force as we know it today is a relatively new beast. It was not until the\nMatt Salter\n\"...the image of kindly Dixon\nof Dock Green with his bend y kneed \"even in' all\" is as much\npart of British consciousness\nas warm beer, overpriced\n\"...most small streets\nhave neither names\nnor pavements so\ngoing out for a swift\nhalf of an evening can\nbe a confusing and\nhazardous business...\"\n1820s that the then\nHome Secretary, Robert\nPeel had the brain wave of putting together a custom-built force\ndedicated to upholding the peace of the\nRealm. Incidentally Peel, a Tory (they\nwere banging on about being the party\nof Law and\nOrder even\nthen it would\nseem), went on\nto be Prime\nMinister - twice\nin fact-until the\nbill for reform of\nthe controversial Corn Laws\nsaw him off.\nNot only did he hotels and losing to Argentina\nestablish the\nmodern police in the WONa Cup...\"\nforce in Britain,\nbut he gave them their first nicknames\n- \"peel ers\" or \"bobbies\" - porcine references were to come at a later date.\nWhy do I bring up all this guff, I hear\nyou ask ? No reason in particular, it's just\nthat last Saturday night I had my first run\nin with the Japanese police since I came\nto this fair (and mind-boggling lye x pen sive) island. Well, not so much a run in\nas a weave in. My experience of the\nlong arm of the law\nin any country, apart\nfrom the incident on\nour school trip to La\nRochelle involving\nthe Chinese fire-crackers, a Sherbet\nDib-Dab and Mrs Frobisher's lunch box\n(and I want to\nemphasise that all\ncharges were\ndropped), has thankfully been limited to\nthe occasional\nrequest to know the time. But in the\ncase of the episode to which I'm refer-ring, I had occasion to consult the local\nr ozz ers( known affectionately as\noma war is an literally 'the honourable\nperson who makes his rounds') on a far\nweightier matter. It was a problem I have frequently experienced back home\nas well as over here: I was trying to find\nmy way to the pub and I had got lost. It's a little known and utterly bewildering\nfact that in Japan - a country so technologically advanced that they produce\nportable televisions the size of a grain\nof sand - most small streets have neither\nnames nor pavements, so going out for\na swift half of an evening can be a confusing and hazardous business at the\nbest of times. Being already two-and-a half sheets to the wind,\nand with a set of scribbled\ndirections in Japanese that\nlooked more like a lottery ticket from\nMars than a map, this was quite definitely not the best of times, hence my\nneed for assistance in finding the bar.\nNow normally officers of the\nlaw and alcohol have as\nmuch of an\naffinity as\nItalians and\nincome tax,\nbut on this\npoint as on\nso many o th ers, Japan is\ndifferent.\nThis is mainly\ndue to the fact that, except for the indictment of top government bureaucrats or\nleading businessmen on charges of\nbribery and corruption every half hour or\nso, Japan has very little of what you or I would recognise as crime, leaving their\nofficers of the law free to provide other\nservices such as directing half-cut and\nslurring foreigners to pubs. But don't run\naway with the idea that the police over\nhere take the problem of public wrongdoing lightly. Quite\nthe opposite. The\nvery scarcity of crime\nmeans that when\nthey actually get a chance to do their\nCarter and Regan bit,\nthey make the most\nof it and will go to\nextraordinary lengths\nto get their man.\nTake for instance\nthe case of a friend of\nmine who one night parked his bicycle\noutside the main station in Sendai, prior\nto heading off to teach English to one\nof his private students. If the place\nwhere he had chosen to leave his trusty\nsteed had been in the suburbs - which\nare dangerously poorly lit in Japan - he\nhad reasoned, he might have great difficulty locating it again, which is why he\nhad left it where he had. My friend's bike was the standard model - two\nwheels, Sturmey-Archer gears and a little shopping basket on the front - there\nare millions like it and it was certainly not\nworth stealing. Except to one person it\nwould appear, because when my friend,\nhis pedagogical duties discharged,\nreturned to the appointed spot, his bike\nwas nowhere to be seen. Thinking he\n\"...the scarcity of crime\nmeans that when the\npolice actually get the\nchance to do their\nCarter and Regan bit,\nthey really make the\nmost of it...\"\nhad simply forgotten where he had left\nit, my friend searched amongst the\ncrowd of others for a good twenty minutes before giving it up as a bad job.\nComing from New York - where even\nkindergarten teachers have taken to carrying concealed weapons for their own\npersonal safety - his natural instincts\nwere to put it down to experience, but\nseeing as the item in question had been\na gift from a grateful student as a thankyou for \"extra-curricula activities\", it had\na certain amount of sentimental value\nand he decided to report its disappear-ance. He heard nothing more for two\nmonths and had almost forgotten all\nabout it - he'd even bought another\nbike - when he received a phone call\nfrom the local police office asking him\nto come and pick up his lost property.\nHe duly went along and was introduced\nto the oma war is an who had \"been\nassigned to the case\". Honestly. That's how little crime they have here - they\nhad had one of their men out scouring\nthe neighbourhood for a beaten-up bicycle that could have been replaced for\nfifty quid. Now that's service. I doubt that\nSpecial Branch back home would have\ntime for that - they're much too busy\nstamping out heroin smuggling and\ncounting the number of corpses buried\nin Fred West's back\ngarden.\nI swerved into\nthe police station\nand, approaching the\ncounter, I gave the\ndesk sergeant my\nmost winning smile\nbefore asking directions to Murphy's Bar\nin the best Japanese\nI could manage\nunder the c irc um stances. Despite the\nfact that I now\nappeared to be speaking in Swahili, I finally succeeded in getting my point\nacross, and PC Plod-san accordingly took\nme outside and, smiling broadly pointed\ndown the street to where the pub sign\nwas winking at me enticing ly.I thanked\nhim with a feeble wave of the hand\nand wove off to the said establishment\nwhere there was a pint of Guinness\nwith my name on it. If he had been surprised to see me - a6'3\" tall foreigner\nhalf-cut and sweating - come sloping\ninto the lobby of his quiet little office asking him to show me the way to the\npub, one can only guess at his reaction\nwhen I came back in a couple of hours\nlater, significantly the worse for wear,\ngrinning like a lunatic and asking him to\nshow me the way to go home.\n\n"

    "content": "23 June 1999 Travel 19\nif not us then who? MPT VK\nm \u2022 m \"if\nRecently four members of Imperial College's Pimllco Connection, Trevor Graham, Zeenab Rabak,\nJessica Smith and myself, Elin Thomas, had the\nchance to go to the 'If not us then who?' conference in\nSalt Lake City, Utah. It is a conference bringing together\n2000 students to discuss community service programmes\nrun by COOL. The conference addresses a whole range\nof issues ranging from hunger and homelessness\nthrough to education and the environment. We went\nto share our ideas by giving a90 minute presentation\non the 'Frustrations of Tutoring', and to collect ideas for\nthe Pimlico Connection. I'm happy to say we were successful in doing both.\nWednesday morning, with a general dazed feeling,\nwe head off to Heathrow. It's just after 6 o 'clock - It\nseems none of us have got up this early in weeks! It still\nhasn't really sunk in that I'm going to Salt Lake City on\nthe other side of the States. I had been waiting for this\nday for the last month, unfortunately I'd have to wait\nalmost 24 hours before arriving in Utah. Stopping a stones throw from New York on the way, we were disappointed we couldn't spend a few days visiting. But\nbefore we could catch our breath it was on to Denver,\nbefore the last leg of the journey ending up in Salt Lake\nCity.\nThree flights later, we finally arrive, tired but excited.\nIt is late at night, so we find a cab to take us to Utah University, a typical yellow cab with the maddest driver I had\never met, excluding a bus driver we met later. The University is the other side of the city, so he gave us a guided\ntour of the city on our way. On arriving at the University\nit wasn't at all clear where we were going to spend the\nnight. I think by this point all we wanted was to sleep!\nWhile waiting for a COOL representative we met some\nof the first students who had arrived for the conference.\nWe were shown to a gym floor, where we were to sleep\nfor the next four nights.\nEarly the next morning we were awake and ready\nto go and check out the city. It was a gorgeous day; we\nhad expected it to be under 10\u00b0C, however it was closer\nto 25\u00b0C. We did some site seeing, including Temple\nSquare, the State Capitol building (modelled on the\nWhite House) and Salt Lake's shopping centre. We\nattracted quite a bit of attention due to our accents. This\nvaried from strangers talking to us in the street, being\npreached at by 'Latter Day Saints' and a bus driver telling\nus about his hobby of breeding budgies. The city came\nacross as a strange mix. The Mormons were really\nfriendly, never missing a chance to tell us about their re li gion.\nIn the evening the conference started. There were\nthree hours of introductory talks, including an introduction to COOL and some very thought provoking speak-ers. The speakers had all been heavily involved in\ncampaigning for issues all around the world. One in particular came to talk about his political involvement in\nBurma; he described his experiences of being arrested\nfor trying to stir the people of Burma to rise up against\nthe regime. By the time we arrived back at the gym it\nhad filled up. There must have been about 200 students\nsleeping on the floor. This gave us a fantastic chance to\nmeet a really wide variety of people.\nFriday was our turn to help the community of Utah.\nWe all set out in opposite directions across the State to\nspend a few hours helping out. I was assigned to Red\nButte Gardens, an extremely beautiful conservation park\nin the mountains surrounding Salt Lake City. Here I helped with the weeding and the set-out of a plot for\nendangered species of plants. The jobs of the 2000 students at the conference varied enormously, from cleaning the apartments of mentally handicapped people,\npainting bookshelves in primary schools through to\nplanting trees.\nThat evening we attended our first wot k shop. I went to a very good one on students tutoring science\nin schools in the States. It was interesting seeing the big\ndifferences between education in the States and our\nown. It seems that we have a better basic science education than the majority of Americans. Again there were\nmore talks in the evening and a count of the num bet of students attending from each state. This ended up\nturning into a riot of people shouting for their own state.\nIt was this evening that we met an extremely mad girl,\nAmanda, and her friends. When we realised there was-n't a sign for the UK she made us one and became determined to embarrass the four of us, by letting the COOL\nrepresentatives know by screaming. It was great to\nmeet some one so uninhibited and easy to get on with.\nThe next day we presented our workshop, which\nwent very well. In fact the 90 minutes flew by and we\nmanaged to create a large amount of discussion on the\ndifference between tutoring schemes in the States and\nin the UK. Our workshop was based around the frustrations inherent in tutoring. It seemed an appropriate\ntopic as every time we go into the classroom we are\nfaced with varying situations that uncover new frustrations. We used a variety of methods to present the mate-rial, including overheads, role-plays and a video of some\nof the stuff we get involved with. Most of the discussion\ncreated was focused around the differences between the\nPimlico Connection and tutoring schemes in the States.\nTutoring schemes in the States tend to be very different\nto the Pimlico Connection. They are mainly run after\nschool and tend to function as more of a mentoring service than we do. We hoped to educate the Americans\nhow we overcome the frustrations we face tutoring, and\nto pick up new ways of approaching the frustrations we\nface in the UK. I think that the biggest frustration that\nwe face is the aspect of time. We are lucky to have\nWednesday afternoons as a free slot in most people's timetables, as this is something that Americans don't seem to have. They find it very difficult to dedicate a regular slot of time to a tutoring scheme, especially as their\nUniversity fees are high and the majority of them have\nto work to pay for their education.\nThe rest of the day was spent attending different\nworkshops and in the evening the 'Oxfam Hunger Banquet'. A particularly good workshop I attended was on\n'Building a better team'; I am hoping that some of the\nideas from the workshop can be used by the Pimlico Connection's committee. The 'Oxfam Hunger Banquet'\nstirred a large amount of debate about the issues of\nhunger and homelessness. Each of us were given parts\nto play. About 10% got to eat a three course meal,\nanother 15% a meal consisting of rice, beans, bread and\nwater and the rest of us, representing the majo t it y of the\nworlds population, got a bowl of rice and a glass of water.\nIt was a thought-provoking activity, which I would like to\nsee more of in the UK.\nSunday marked the end of the conference. After\nanother workshop and a closing talk people started to\nmake their way back to their home states. Inspired, we\nleft for the UK; it was another 24 hours before we would\narrive home.\nI greatly appreciated the chance I had to go to the\nCOOL conference. Four days concentrating on community service related issues gave me quite a few ideas\nI want to try and implement in the UK, in particular ideas\nthat may be able to be co-ordinated into the Pimlico Connection. It also allowed me to make new friends and to\nmeet a large variety of enthusiastic people who care\nabout issues in their community. It is an experience I would love to repeat.\nElin Thomas\n\n"

The debate attracted the attention\nof Simon Baker and David Hellard, the latter pursuing the matter for some time\nand even threatening protest action.\nThe Health Centre's sign lied...\nHowever, the ICU President came\nunder fire himself after presenting proposals concerning CCU clubs to ICU\nCouncil. Hellard suggested that such\nclubs should be moved to ICU control, an\nIdea immediately condemned by CCU\nexec members. Despite attempts to justify his position and some support from\nwithin the Union, it was clear that this\nwas one issue CCUs were not easily\ngoing to be defeated on.\nA minor news story at the time\nrevealed that STA Academic Travel were\nto be replaced, and questions were\nbeing raised concerning the way the\nnew service provider was being chosen.\nRumours of financial discrepancies were\nrife, but without any actual facts the\nissue subsided until resurrected by Simon\nBaker late in the Summer term.\nTrouble on campus was also a theme\nfor the month, with several thefts affecting the Union and Electrical Engineering.\nViolence erupted after a Tamil night on\nCollege premises, although it was later\nrevealed that the perpetrators had not\nbeen members of the college.\nJanuary\nViolence unfortunately marked the start\nof the Spring term also, as a member of\ncollege's catering staff was attacked in\nthe JCR. The men responsible took off\nwith a substantial sum of money, but\nluckily the victim was not seriously\ninjured. Bad news also came in the form\nof another meningitis case, leading to\nthe hospital is ation of a first year, but fortunately the student concerned re cov ered.\nWade Gayed, ICSMSU President,\nbegan to enjoy a much less stressful life,\nafter Felix revealed that \u00a355,000 originally thought to** have gone 'missing'\nfrom the medics' reserves had in fact\nbeen lost due to an accountancy error by\nthe college. The medics also enjoyed a very successful RAG week, although\nthere was some trouble when a group of\nstudents attempted to hitch a lift on the\nMl. Meanwhile ICU RAG faced a set-back\nwith the announcement that there would\nbe no beer fest in RAG week, which had\nbeen rescheduled for the end of January\nfollowing similar problems in the previous term. The Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump, however, was more successful than last year, with sixteen blok es running naked from Harrods to the\nUnion and raising over \u00a31,000 in the\nthat of DP (Education & Welfare).\nJanuary also saw a short letter complaining about the lack of a social area\nat Clayponds Hall in South Ealing. More\nwas to come, and eventually the residents would have their way, but at a price...\nFebruary\nThis was elections month. In the end an\nunprecedented fourteen candidates\nstood, with seven for ICU President. On\npaper the similarities between the candidates outweighed the differences, but\nNatasha Newton, being the only medic,\nwas always going to be the favourite.\nRobin Pitt stood out as the only candidate\nwith a strong political agenda, favouring\na closer association with the NUS, and\nDennis Patrickson ran a good campaign,\nbased on communication, com mu nica tion, communication.\nIt seemed that the current s a bbs1 dream had been realised, and students\nwere further encouraged by the offer of\n\u00a31 a pint beer at the South Ken hus-tings. Ian Clifford (standing for DP(F&S)) turned up to hustings in drag, fulfil inga promise made at the RAG slave auction\nearlier in the year. Stuart Cook, standing\nfor ICU President, preferred the minimalist approach, and didn't turn up for\nICU suffered a vandalised Coke machine\nSNKPJers heading for glory\nprocess.\nInside ICU the politics was hot ting up. The CCU v Hellard debate raged on\nthrough another meeting of ICU Council, with the President facing letters of\ncomplaint and criticism from all the CCUs,\nmost notably from RSM President Alastair\nfox. College announced that the Union\nwould get the East and West wing basements of Beit Quad when the redevelopment was finished in the summer of\n2000, allaying the fears of the previous\nterm. Sabbatical elections were\napproaching rapidly, with the current\nsabbatical team determined to increase\nawareness of their importance within\nthe student populace. This year also saw\nthe creation of a new sabbatical position,\nProspective Presidents prove their worth\nhustings or mount a campaign.\nThe results, though, were fairly pre-dic table. Both Kevin Butcher (DP(E&W)) and David Roberts (Felix Editor) won easy\nvictories over New Election, while Tim\nTrailor defeated Duncan Field in the contest for DP(C&S). Natasha Newton was\nelected as ICU President, thanks largely\n\u2022to a large medic vote, with Dennis\nPatrickson the only other candidate to\ncome close. Numerous recounts eventually elected Ian Clifford as DP(F&S), his\nwinning margin being just one vote.\nSports grounds were on the agenda\nthis month, with rumours circulating that\nCollege planned to sell Teddington in the\nnot too distant future. A College proposal suggested Imperial should aim for\njust one ground and, as Harlington is the\nonly one large enough, Cobham looked\nlike it would be up for sale too. Clearly\nTim Trailor will have work to do next\nyear. Meanwhile Chelsea FC suffered a terrible fate at Harlington during a training session, when various Rolexes and\nthousands in cash were stolen from the\nplayers' changing rooms.\nEarly on in the month ICU Council\ndecided that ICSMSU should keep its\nsabbatical officer for another year, meaning that a successor was needed for the\n2000/01 year. Senior sources at St Mary's reported to Felix that Glaxo were intending to buy several floors of the medical\nschool - allegations vehemently denied\nby other senior sources in ICSM. Clearly\nthere was, and probably still is, some\nsort of power struggle going on within\nthe corridors of power.\nThe annual problem of bike theft\nraised its head again, starting with a few\nletters accusing security of not doing\nenough to combat the problem. Ken\nWeir, Head of Security, fought back,\nmaintaining that the college was doing\nall it could, and that the sheer number of\nbikes on the South Ken campus meant\nit was always going to be a target.\nThe first signs of problems for the\nSummer Ball came in the form of a \u00a316,500 deficit on their budget, which\nhad to be made up with sponsorship. As\nthe term drew on and no definite sponsors appeared, the event looked in\ndoubt... Early signs of possible exam disruption in the summer also appeared, as\nthe Association of University Teachers\nthreatened strike action in its pay dispute,\nwhich continued unresolved throughout\nthe term.\nICU's RAG was announced to have\nbeen a success, raising \u00a35,000 for charity and providing a good few laughs\nalong the way. Amusement was also\nprovided by a spate of Felix imitations,\nstarted off by Guildsheet Editor Dinesh\nGanesarajah. After considering legal\naction, felix decided that imitation was\nRAG goes the Full Monty..\n\n"

A senior member of the Jedi Council (exile on Dagoba presumably\narrives at a later date) he's long on wisdom and short on stature.\nJAR JAR BINKS Ahmed Best\nPushing out the envelope of effects technology has resulted in\nthe inclusion of Jar Jar, a completely computer generated char-act er. Purveyor of most of The Phantom Menace's humour, he\ntraipses around the galaxy as Qul-Jon's Chewbacca-esque sidekick.\nSENATOR PALPATINE Ian McDiarmid\nReprising his role from the original movies, McDiarmid's Palpatine will eventually become the ultra-evil Emperor. Although\nhe's destined to rule the Galaxy, at present he's an outstanding senator from the peaceful, neutral, planet of Naboo.\nMACE WIND U Samuel L Jackson\nAlongside Yoda, Windu is one of the most respected members of the Jedi Council. Giving Jackson an opportunity to fulfil a life-long dream, the role of Wlndu is really only a cameo,\nappearing briefly in sage discussion with the small green one.\nmm*\nm Finally, the most over-hyped movie of all time is\nabout to arrive on these shores. By that I don't mean\nto say it's no good - like most of the rest of you I haven't seen The Phantom Menace yet, (although\nconsidering the number of bootleg copies around,\navoiding it is becoming problematic) -1 simply mean that\nit's just not possible for any movie to live up to that kind\nof expectation.\nViewed with the benefit of hindsight, 77fan/\" c went\ndown a storm largely due to the fact that everyone\nexpected it to be truly awful, and thus when it finally\narrived it seemed like a classic - The Phantom Menace\nfaces the same effect in reverse. Our combined\nexpectations are already so vast that (try as hard as we\nmight) we're almost certain to find it something of a disappointment. Similarly, nothing but the best will be\nseen as good enough by the movie's backers Twentieth\nCentury Fox. Consequently, despite breaking all kinds of\nbox office records and grossing over $300 million within a month in the US, it's still being viewed as a iet-down by\nexecs frustrated that their confident assurances that It\nwould easily outstrip Titanic in the all-time box-office\ncharts might not be borne out in reality.\nSo does that make it a bad movie? No, of course not.\nGeorge Lucas is a master of the grown-up kiddies movie\n(at the end of the day, Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back\nand Return of the Jedi are really little more than family-orientated, U certificate fun) and I 'll be amazed if Episode\nOne isn't incredibly enjoyable. The point is that none of\nthe previous movies were anything mote than that, so if\nyou book your ticket in the expectation of seeing\nsomething that will change your life you're almost certain\nto be sorely disappointed.\nAnyway, enough with the doom and gloom - what's it going to be like? Well, If the trailers and pre-publicity are\nanything to go by, The Phantom Menace will be top\nentertainment on a broad sweeping scale, complete with\nm esme rising pod races (skimming across the barren\nlandscape of Tatooine), underwater cities, robotic\nsoldiers, light sabre duels and the mandatory attack on a space station. Plus a cast who, unlike those who graced\nthe first three movies, are act j ally familiar with the art of\nacting. 1\nIn reality, the only danger would seem to be that it's far more effects driven than the previous movies. Sure,\nStar Wars owed much of its success to some stunning\neffects, which were so far ahead of their time that they\nstill look damned impressive today, yet the effects helped\nthe story to stick to its epic flow (Lucas' opus is frequently\ncompared to classic westerns in terms of both its scope\nand style), rather than acting as the centre of attention.\nThis time around, however, the effects would seem to be\nat the core of the movie - indeed Lucas frequently claims\nthat the cause of the sixteen year delay between Return\nof the Jedi and Episode One was simply the need for\neffects technology to advance to a level where he could\nfully realise his vision.\nConsequently, we're faced with the first completely\ncomputer generated character to appear in a live-action\nmovie (in the shape of the much-maligned Jar Jar Binks),\nan entire army of CGI invaders (the cartoon-y battle\ndroids), and wall-to-wall blue-screened backdrops.\nIndeed, such was the scope of the technological wizardry\nat play on the set of The Phantom Menace that when\nNatalie Portman sprained her ankle during shooting, the\nCG animators managed to show her walking normally.\nMore to the point, rumour has it that the next installment\n(due to go into pre-production in Australia sometime\nsoon) will be so dependant on digital effects that there\nwon't be any 'real' sets at all. And whilst all that might\nsound like a movie packed full of the amazing visuals that\nwe're all hoping for, the danger is that the effects act as a distraction from the plot which they bind together - or,\nworse still, that Lucas simply replaces genuine depth and\ncharacter is ation with the might of Industrial Light and\nMagic.\nUltimately, however, the power and mysticism that\nthe Star Wars movies hold In our collective conscience\nwill make The Phantom Menace into this summer's most\nmemorable movie, no matter what the finished product's really like. And, at the end of the day, with some of the\nworld's finest talent, $125 million and sixteen years\nbehind it, do you really believe it's possible for Star Wars:\nEpisode One to be anything less than stunning?\nTH l Ml \u2014 I Episode\nStar Wars\nThe Phantom Menace\nA long time ago\nin a galaxy far, far away . . .\nTurmoil has engulfed the Galactic\nRepublic. The taxation of trade routes\nto outlying star systems is in dispute.\nHoping to te solve the matter with\na blockade of deadly battleships,\nthe greedy Trade Federation has\nstopped all shipping to the small\nplanet of Naboo . . .\nWith imminent conflict brewing between the powerful Trade\nFederation and the peaceful planet of Naboo, Qui-Gon Jinn\nand his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to the sparsely populated planet to warn the Queen of the danger that faces her,\nand of the galactic fallout which is to follow. Joining them on\ntheir journey is Qui-Jon's co-pilot, the floppy-eared outcast Jar\nJar Binks, and the powerful Captain Panaka.\nOnce on Naboo, the Jedi must convince young Padme\nof her impending fate, and convince the planet's other inhabitants - the amphibious Gunguns, who live deep beneath the\noceans and are lead by the formidable Boss Nass (voiced by\nthe forever-shouting Brian Blessed) - to come to their aid.\nTheir mission fails, however, and Naboo is invaded by\nhordes of battle droids, forcing the Jedis to evacuate the\nplanet with the Queen and her court. Battling their way\nthrough the Trade Federation blockade, they travel to the\nlonely desert planet of Tatooine where they meet a young boy\ncalled Anakin Skywalker who is evidently as one with the Force.\nAnakin and his mother are slaves, owned by short-tempered\njunk-dealer Watto whose principle trade is selling droids and\nspares to the teams competing in the (highly dangerous) local\npod races which take place in Tatooine's least desirable res-i den ce, Mos Espa. The two Jedi enlist his help in fighting the\nwar, with Obi Wan believing him to be \"the one\" spoken of\nin legend who will \"bring balance to the force\".\nWith their quest now agreed, the group heads to Coruscant - centre of the known Universe and home to both the\nJedi Council and Galactic Senate - where young Anakin is introduced to Yoda and Mace Windu. It's here that we'll also find\nthe revered Senator Palpatine, who represents the sector that\nincludes Naboo and will later become the evil Emperor.\nUltimately, the Jedis will be called upon to confront the\nDark Lords behind the invasion, controlled by the sinister, dou-ble-ended light sabre wielding, Darth Maul. Meanwhile, his\nmaster Darth Sidious, the last of the Sith, continues to lead\nthe invasion whilst unseen by any of the principle characters\n- and thus it is he who represents the true Phantom Menace.\n\n"

    "content": "23 June 1999 Science 9\nA Trip Through\nImagine going to see England play football in the world cup. In 1966. Or you could go to 2999 to see what kind of parties they're\npreparing for the third millennium. What about going back a hundred years and putting some money into a bank account? Back in\nthe present, you'll have accumulated more money than the Sultan of Brunei could ever dream of. You know, with a time machine,\nanything is possible! Alok Jha looks at how you could book a trip through time.\nT ime travel is a favourite in science\nfiction. People skip between different times almost as effortlessly as\nyou might send an email or ignore reading your lecture notes. The machines they\nuse are widely varied too. There's the\nTARDIS in Dr Who, a phone booth in Bill\nand Ted's Excellent Adventures and, of\ncourse, the famous DeLorean in Back to\nthe Future. Each of these devices have\ntheir own mechanism of defeating the\nprogress of time's arrow as they hurtle\ntheir occupants through countless adventures in countless different times. While\nthese make great stories, it will come as\nno surprise to anyone that actually travelling through time is not an easy thing\nto do. So what exactly are the problems? Theoretically, there are meth\nod s of travelling through time\nGeneral Relativity says that\nit's possible to bend\nspace in such a way that\nyou can create things\ncalled 'wormholes'. By\ntravelling through these,\nyou can take a shortcut\nthrough space and\ncover huge distances\nvery quickly. This con- 1\nce pt can be taken a step\nfurther to encompass time\ntravel as well. Since space\nand time are similar concepts %\nIn General Relativity, there's no\nreason why you can't have a worm\nhole connecting two different points in\ntime as well as two different points in\nspace. By travelling through one of these,\nyou can travel through time. There are\nproblems with this model though. The\nmain one is that we have no idea if wormholes actually exist anywhere in the uni-verse. It has been postulated that they\nmay exist inside black holes, but this idea\nsuffers from the fact that it can never actually be tested. As far as creating artificial\nwormholes goes, you can forget it. The\ntechnology we have at the moment is far\ntoo crude to do anything like bend huge\namounts of space or time into worm-holes. You would need materials that you\ncould subject to extreme conditions and\nDr Andrew Liddle, of the Astrophysics\nDepartment at Imperial College, believes\nthat we won't have anything like that for\nthe next millennium or so.\nThen there are questions about\nwhich way in time you could actually go.\nThere are a lot of people who think that\ntravelling backwards in time will never\nbe possible. Their argument Is that. If we\ndo ever develop the technology to travel\nback in time, there should be evidence of\nit already. In other words, people from\nthe future should be amongst us\nright now. Since\nthere has\nno hard evidence to\nsupport this, we can safely say that no-one\nfrom the future has ever been here. Or\ncan we? Jenny Randies, author of over\nforty books on the paranormal and time\ntravel, believes otherwise. She strongly\nsuspects that we have indeed been visited by people from the future but that\nthey keep their identity secret. \"Like we\nwatch animals in the jungle/', she suggests, \"the people from the future watch\nus from a distance.\" She says that there\nis a lot of evidence to support her ideas.\nOne of her ideas is to look for what she\ncalls 'out of place objects'. These are, as\ntheir name suggests, things which exist in\nplaces where they shouldn't be. Like\niron nails in rock beds that were formed\nmillions of years before the appearance\nof man. Or human-like footprints which\ncan be dated to similar times. Jenny Randies suggests that things like the nails may\nwell have been carried to their discovery\nsites from the future and that the footprints are those of time travellers.\nAnother problem with the whole time\ntravel thing is that of paradoxes. Let's assume you\ncan go\nback in time\ni UV ( Mi great grandfather. Imagine what\nwould happen if you had an argument\nwith the old man and ended up killing\nhim. He could never meet your great\ngreat grandmother and your family would\n.not exist. More importantly, you would\nnever exist. So if you never existed, you\ncouldn't have gone back in time to kill\nyour great great grandfather. So that\nmeans that he survived and that he did\nmeet your great great grandmother after\nall and that your family does exist. So that\nmeans that you were born as well and\nyou can now go back in time again and\nkill him. But that means that... and so on.\nThere ate two ways of getting around\nparadoxes like this one. The first is to say\nthat history has already happened and\nthat it is already set in stone. That means\nthat, if you did go back in time, then the\nfact that you are here now means that\nyou didn't kill your great gt eat grand fa ther. If you do go back and try to kill him,\ntime will conspire against you and you will\nsomehow be prevented from doing it.\nThis means you cannot change history.\nThe second way out of the pata do x is to\nemploy some quantum mechanical think-ing. Professor Chris Isham, head of the\ntheoretical physics group at Imperial College, says that if you did travel back\nin time and kill your great great\ngrandfather, you would return\nJ m to a different present from\nIhe one you came, [\"his is\n^ , basically what happened\nin Back to the Future\nI Part 2. The idea is that\n' '\n\u2022\n' \u2022' 1\n\u2022' v;'5J make forces you down\n\u2022 Lu gig t*'\"w ti cula r path through\nv:;';.';/ \u2022;'/''\"':* '\n\u2022 lime. This leads to the\nil' J IT\" IC\n'EA TNAT TNERE ARE\nAN\ninfinite number of uni->w verses out there, each ol\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 which represent all of the\n-Jr results of all the possible dec i \u2022 y prs ions you could have made in\nyour life. Going back in time to\nv change one of those decisions will\nmake you enter another universe, and so\nthere is no paradox. In that universe, you\nnever existed anyway.\nSo where does all of this leave us with\ntime travel? Basically, it looks like we\nwon't see people stepping into machines\nand disappearing into another time for a while. Certainly it seems as though it\nwon't happen in our lifetimes. But, once\nagain, Jenny Randies thinks differently.\nShe says that we will see some form of\ntime travel within the next thirty or forty\nyears. It will not be a situation where people can physically travel but one where we\nsee information from the future travelling\ninto the past. She thinks that the first indications of time travel will come when we\nbegin to see messages on our computer\nscreens which have been sent from an\nexperiment twenty years in Ihe future...\n\n"

    "content": "23 June 1999 Arts\nFRIENDS OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE SUMMER EXHIBITION\nSherfield Gallery\nm::::<fS S|: ip\nF our artists with four distinct styles form\nthe basis of this year's Friends of Imperial College Summer Exhibition. Lying\nbetween the reception lobby of the Sherfield building and the Main Dining Hall, the\nante-room has been hosting a selection of\nwork by the artists Jan Tinholt, Jan Hruska,\nLuce Ceas and Peter Young.\nJan Tinholt was born in Utrecht, Netherlands, in 1950. He grew up in a working\nclass background - his father was a mechanic and his mother a housewife - the\nfamily's financial situation prevented him\nfrom attending the Academy of Arts.\nInstead he became a social worker, specialising in the field of child psychiatry.\nThree years later in 1983, he found he\nrequired a release for his self-expression.\nFollowing a Christmas gift of paint and\nbrushes, he instantly finished his social\nwork and started a three-year struggle\nresearching colours and perfecting layering\ntechniques. Since his first Exposition in\n1985, he has become well known in the\nNetherlands and has been included in the\nbooks Lexicon of Twentieth Century Dutch\nNaive Art by Nico Vander Endt and First\nChoice, both of which have raised him to\nthe level of international recognition.\nHe is one of the leading Dutch artists\nof the Naive style, typified by simplified\ncartoon-like images of people and back-grounds. While the British Naive artists\nfavour scenes set in either domestic urban\nor seaside situations, Jan Tinholt depicts\narboreal and river scenes pulled from his\nown subconscious. His characters exist\nwithin an almost natural Utopia unspoilt by\nthe machines and stresses of post-industrial\nsociety.\nJan Hruska began painting late into\nhis life. Born in Lysice, Czech Republic, he\nwas brought up in a working class family\nwith six other brothers and sisters. He was\nemployed as a shop assistant in a drug store\nuntil the age of 47, when he took up painting because he lost his garden where he\ngrew roses and wanted a new hobby. His\ntechnique is unique as he uses adapted\nsyringes to apply oil paint to hat d board. Layering these fine strings of colour creates\nimpressive and expressive detail, the whole\nimage resembling the fine needlework\nfound on medieval tapestry. His images are\nrepresentative of memories from his child-hood, scenes from old etchings and prints\nof Czech cities from the area around Blansko. The images represent a simpler and\nsupposedly quieter existence where the\nurban environment is blended with the\nrolling countryside. His work is renowned\nboth nationally and internationally as one\nof the leading Czech naive artists, having\na permanent exhibition in the Naive Art\nGallery in Litomeric, and displayed in the\nFolk Art Museum in Boston, Pompidou\nGallery and the Musee d 'Art Naif de Hie de\nFrance in Paris.\nLuce Geas retired from being a University Lecturer, after having studied at the\nSorbonne and LSE, to become a full time\npainter over twenty years ago. She has\nexhibited her work in London, Paris, Hong\nKong and Washington DC and the Arts\nCommittee of UNICEF has used her work\non a selection of Greetings cards throughout the world. Her work is more conventional in style and form, and she uses oil and\ncanvas for most of her images. This exhibition displays a selection of her seascapes\nand still-life paintings of flowers. The\nseascapes in particular use vivid blues and\ngreens to form coherent surfaces and\nemphasise the cold depths of the sea.\nPeter Young was born in London and\nwas introduced to painting by the Austrian\nartist, Margarita Hammerschlag. He first\nstarted sketching while doing National Service In Egypt. He later went on to study at\nthe Faculty of Painting Conservation at the\nAcademy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Returning\nto England, he was appointed Restorer at\nthe City Art Gallery Bristol before heading\nthe paintings section of the conversation\ndepartment of the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum. He creates his images using large\nbrush strokes to form pools of distorted\ncolour using the media of oil paints on\npaper. The completed work creates an\nimage almost entirely opposite to Jan\nHruska's detailed composition.\nGary\nmm\n\n"

I was wondering what\nwould happen having read Simon\nBaker's column last week, and I wasn't disappointed. I was flatly (but politely)\ntold that they cannot get student fares,\neven if I am paying with a purchase\norder number. (I wish to fly to Edinburgh for a meeting for my PhD\nresearch). STA used to, and I thought\nthe quality of service was supposed to\nbe better now. Ah, now I see, there is\nno mention of the number of services.\nClearly College think that research\nstudents should be spending more of\ntheir research grants (in my case the\ngrant is from College) on travel! Well,\nthey've lost my commission, as I'm going to STA now. I wonder if they will\naccept a purchase order number...\nPhD student, TH Huxley School\nProposals for a Better IC\nDear Felix,\nCould you please remind Mr. Tony Ofori\nof Felix that before the Prince Consort\nbought the 21 acres with money from\nthe Great Exhibition the whole area\nwas Green.\nPrinces Gardens and Ennismore\nGardens remain Green as does Hyde\nPark. Whereas the Queen's Lawn is\nmainly a vast open litter bin. We now\nhave the Weekes Arms,- the Frobisher\nKellar, the Linstead Pub and the Tlzzard Pizza Parlour and sometimes 200\nhundred steel drums of empty steel\nbarrels to show for it. We also have\nmedical waste scattered around from\ntime to time.\nIt would be easy to double the\ncharges of beverages on the IC Campus\nand recoup the loss of earnings from\nthe very few parking spaces lost.\nI had to call IC security to attend to\nnoise and drugs abuse this week at\n0320am at No 13/14 Princes Gardens.\nThere will be masses of student accommodation available in Paddington\nshortly - See New fife for Paddington\nproject. There will be summer jobs for\nIC students too in Paddington. At the\nminute it is a concrete jungle so Mr.\nOfori will feel at home there.\nAt week ends the college should\ncharge the same prices as the NCP Cark\nPark near the House of Commons which is \u00a39.00 for over 2 hrs. Housing\nEstates are experiencing huge problems with an influx of refugees and\nthe noise they make right through the\nnight and the day too.\nI tried to call Felix on 594 8064 to\nget their fax number but to no avail.\nDid you Nie ever resolve the ingenious\nflower watering problem with your\ninsurance Company. You could issue a Tennis Court ticket to Ennismore Gardens Mews Residents who collected\nthe money or contributed to the construction and planting discussed some\nfour weeks ago with BHS. You could\ngive one free Parking Space for Jennifers Harley Davidson or Carol's bicycle.\nI must say you are all Engineers of\nExceptional Ingenuity when it comes to\nexplaining why it takes so long to get\nanything done by the Estates Department at IC.\nSheffield University give the MAPPIN medal for the Year's most exceptional student. The Vice-Chancellor of\nBrunei was a winner in his day. To celebrate the Rector's elevation I would\nlike to propose a Mappin Medal for the\nYear's most celebrated E.E. I event.\nDavid Mappin\nDissent from the Ranks?\nfirstly I'd like to apologise in advance for\nusing this page as a forum for my incoherent ranting - maybe if more of you\nhad written letters this week then there\nwouldn't be space for this.\nPolitics, they say, is a funny old\ngame. Student politics, I have decided,\nisn't even funny. It is, to be frank, a pile\nof arse.\nThe basic problem is power. Specifically there isn't any. College gives not\na flying fuck for us and our opinions,\nand having watched the petty bickering\nand backstabbing which seems to hold\nendless fascination for so many, I can't say I blame them.\nICU is bad; the Constituent College\nUnions are worse. The general apathy\ntowards politics which is regularly\nberated is due to no-one really caring.\nAll we want is something to keep us\namused and a nice big salary at the end\nof our time here.\nIf there's one issue that irritates me\nit's that of Medics. I don't have a problem with your typical Medic-in-the-bar,\nbut those who insist on moaning about\nIC in general really need to .become\naware that they are part of something\nbigger now. This goes doubly for the\nnon-Medics out there who seem to dislike ICSM on general principles. Most\nMedics are pleasant, articulate individuals who happen to be doing a slightly\ndifferent course. They're not hugely different from any of the rest of us,\nalthough I do appreciate that clinical\nstudents in particular have different\nissues and problems.

Nothing like them for\nbreeding prejudice, is there?\nGiven IC's appetite for gobbling up\nother functional institutions and inflicting its idiocy on them, isn't it about\ntime students stopped bitching about\neach other (and that counts for both\n'sides') and started on people who really\ndeserve it, i.e. the IC administration?

The rollercoaster eighteen month shoot (the\nlongest on record by far) has now\nbecome the stuff of legend - Harvey\nKeitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were\ndropped along the way, whilst conservative estimates suggest that star Cruise\nhas lost in excess of $100 million thanks\nto his decision to sign up fot the movie.\nMore to the point, two years after production started, virtually no-one on the\nplanet actually knows what Eyes Wide\nShut is actually about.\nShrouded in secrecy, all that's known at present is that Cruise and Kidman star as two married psychiatrists\nwho are cheating on each other with\ntheir patients, leading to their lives\nbecoming in twined with some of the\nshadier parts of the 70s New York under-world. Probably. It's also believed to be\nshockingly erotic - we're talking censor-troubling degrees of realism - touching\non S&M, masturbation and Tom Cruise\ncross-dressing along the way. The trailer\n- which consists of Hollywood's most\nsuccessful couple making out naked in\nfront of a mirror - certainly suggests that\nthe movie to come will be of a fairly\n'adult' nature.\nQuite how audiences will react is\nuncertain, but coupling the world's biggest star with one of the greatest\ndirectors of all time (witness Full Metal\nJacket, The Shining and 2007 if you dis-agree) surely represents a thoroughly\nbank able movie? If nothing else, the\nprospect of Cruise and Kidman getting\nhot and steamy should draw in a fairly\nhefty crowd, even if the movie itself\nturns out to be another A Clockwork\nOrange.\nED TV\nRELEASE DATE: September 10\nSTARS: Matthew McConaughey, Woody\nHarrelson, Ellen DeGenres\nDIRECTOR: Ron Howard\nMatthew McConaughey is Ed,\nthe boy-next-door type chosen to star in a round-the-clock do cu soap designed to boost a US\nTV station's flagging ratings. At first he\n(naturally) finds the chance to broadcast his every whim live to the entire\nnation utterly amazing, but soon he\nfinds his entire life is trapped inside the\nshow. Sound vaguely familiar?\nWell, if you think it sounds not\nentirely unlike The Truman Show, then\nyou're not alone. The US audiences\nclearly thought so, and stayed away\nfrom the movie in their droves, despite\nthe combination of an amazingly talented cast (Harleson is Ed's best mate,\nDeGenres the des pet ate TV exec in\ncharge of the project, and Martin Landau, Liz Hurley and Rob Reiner all\nappear in supporting roles) and a big-name director {Apollo 13, Far and Away,\nRansom, Parenthood, Cocoon).\nOn this side of the Atlantic, with\nboth Truman and Pleasantville little\nmore than dim and distant memories,\nit definitely looks like it'll be worth a look, with the trailer suggesting a much\ndarker tone than last year's Jim Carrey\nstar rer. You see, with his relationships\nbroadcast across the nation, 24 hours a day, he starts to learn about the evils of\nTV - his friends desert him when publishers offer big bucks to dish the dirt,\nand random assorted bimbos congregate around him in search of their fifteen minutes of fame. Understandably,\nEd, his parents and his girlfriend are far\nfrom happy, and he begins to plot his\nrevenge. Nonetheless, this being a Ron\nHoward film there's bound to be a happy ending at the end of it all, and\nplenty of decent gags along the way.\nOf course, there's always another\npossible reason for the appa ling boxoffice in the States - would you fork out\n$10 to see a movie with a Bon jo vl title\ntrack?\n\n"

    "content": "22 Homelands 99 23 June 1999\nBy Ed Sexton\nIt's4am. You're in a tent. In a field. Lasers and strobes are\nstrafing across the crowd of 5000 souls you're embedded\nin. Suddenly an unmistakable melody floats towards you\nfrom the dozens of speakers positioned in the corners. You\nsmile. 5000 people smile. Paul van Dyk looks out from\nbehind the decks with a mischievous grin on his face,\nbefore dropping in the beat from yet another classic\ntrance tune. The crowd go wild - dancing, jumping, wav-ing, screaming - as waves of euphoric music flow through\nyou and with you. Everything is right in the world. There\nis no place, no time, you'd rather be. Welcome to the dance\nfestival experience.\nHeld somewhere near Winchester on 29 and 30 May,\nthis was always going to be a dance festival not to miss.\nSure, it may cost \u00a350, but with seven tents and two sound\nstages hosting over 100 DJs and live acts for seventeen\nhours, it was always going to be worth it.\nOne of the great things about one-day festivals is how\nlittle you need to take. We left London on a sunny Saturday morning with only the best driving tunes, some food\nand spending money. And we were of course, as Hunter\nS Thompson would say, armed to the teeth...\nAlthough gates opened at midday, there were no acts\non to 1pm. We used the first hour to orientate ourselves\nand generally prepare for the mata th on dance event that\nlay before us. So many excellent sound smiths were scheduled for Homelands that there was only one way to sur-vive: Dance till you drop, and then dance some more for\ngood measure. Not all of us we te going to make it...\n2pm BlackStar Uner: Choque Hosein was up there exhibiting the usual signs of someone whose taken one too\nmany gram mes of speed, prancing round the stage to a crowd of several hundred. The fact that all but ten of them\nwere sitting down didn't seem to bother him much. They\nplayed a respectable selection of dub by tunes, however,\nincluding the excellent 'Yemen Cutta Gonnection1\n. Why\nweren't they on in the early evening?\n3pm Danny Rampling: Now this is silly. Danny Rampling\nplaying to a dance crowd of twenty-something? Dance\nmusic at its best is a fusion between crowd and DJ: Good\nDJs choose tunes on the fly based on the crowd's atmosphere, and Mr Rampling definitely suffered from the lack\nof Dionysian input. Still, someone has to play the afternoon\nsets...\n3.30pm Gilles Peterson: We had been promised 'un pre ce dented sound levels', due to the site being situated in a natural bowl, and we weren't disappointed. Some foolish\nperson had left the bass on far too high for Peterson: You\ndidn't so much hear the techno as feel it shaking the vertebrae of your spine. There was only one thing for it; lie\nback on the grass, absorb the beats, and chill...\n4pm Brandon Bloc While Peterson was vibrating the MixMag tent from its foundations, a large crowd had gathered\nin the Slinky tent for some upfront house. And upfront it\nwas, with Brandon Bloc wearing, well, nothing really. The\nfirst real dance session of the day, this increased the\ntempo for the night ahead.\n4.30pm Les Rythmes Digltales: It isn't just Felix reviewers\nwho think they're French; apparently the organisers hired\na French sound technician for the event. Doh! Anyway, we\nraced back to the Home tent to catch some very funky\ntunes, including the now overplayed 'From Disco to Disco'.\nIf you get the chance to see them, take it.\nBy 5pm it was time for a short pause and reflection.\nAnd more importantly, time for baked potatoes - the only\nfood I eat at festivals. Sitting under the smiling inflatable\nfive metre man that marked the meeting point, we realised\nhow much there was to do. There was a fairground.\nThere was a bungee. Further investigation revealed that\nwithin the Ericsson tent (guess the major sponsors) one\ncould obtain a free massage, phone anywhere in the UK\nfor free, and purchase a mobile while you were at it. Ironically you could barely get a signal on the site.\nThere were stalls selling everything from blankets to\nbongs. There was the Bud Ice Bus (yes, a real bus), one\nof the two outdoor sound stages, playing weird funky stuff\nall afternoon. There was the bar, playing Salsa and other\nLatin American genres, open all the time. And then, in front\nof us, there was judge jules on the Radio 1 Stage. Damnit,\nwe've missed the Jungle Brothers...\n7pm Faithless: So there has to one cock-up, and unfortunately for Faithless it came in the form of a blown sound\nsystem. The prolonged wait killed the atmosphere some-what. 'Insomnia' got the crowd going, but many left a few\nsongs later. All the same, it's not every day you see Faithless live.\nDusk brought on a mad panic. Seven acts to see, all\nplaying at the same time??? There was only one solution;\ndance your way from one tent to the next, taking in a few\ntunes in each. So here it goes... DJ Shadow in the Home\ntent was cool, but completely un dance able, prompting a swift exit to the MixMag tent, where Red Snapper were\nshaking down the jazzy beats of '4 Dead Monks'... Meanwhile Judge Jules had moved over to the Slinky tent and\nDanny Tenaglla had started his mammoth 10 hour set in\nthe D tent (so-called because Its three acts were Danny\nRampling, Deep Dish and DT); across on the other side\nof the site Justin Robertson was driving the Bus Ice Bus for\nall it was worth, but I was caught by Dave Angel in one of\nthe two End tents, mixing his own brand of hard house\nand techno, and thus missed Ronl Size in the other End\ntent. Asian Dub Foundation had started up in the Home\ntent with a collection of tunes that were, well, dub by. We\ncould only stay for a few tunes, though, as news came\nthrough that next door in MixMag Underworld had\ndrop ppe d the first beat...\n10pm Underworld: Karl Hyde can dance. I mean really\ndance. Every joint in the man's body must be dislocated.\nThrough the ecstatic heights of'Moaner' and 'Push Upstairs'\nhe urged the crowd, which stretched out of the tent and\nbeyond, to new levels of madness. When they dropped\n'Born Slippy' in somewhat unexpectedly the normal cheers\nand hand waving didn't happen; everyone was already\nbeyond fever pitch anyway. The only downer was that to\nget near the front required levitation skills.\nAlmost running into the Essential Mix tent, i suddenly\nfound myself dancing to the uplifting mixing of John Digweed. A welcome break from the intensity of Underworld, Digweed was playing the kind of trance y house\nyou'd expect. Moving onto the Slinky tent I found Seb\nFontaine had set up a small cheese shop, complete with\nscantily clad female dancers and fake olympic-like flames.\nI had to indulge.\nA quick mooch around the far corner of the site\nrevealed that fairground rides at night are cool, festival toilets at night are dangerous and Danny Tenaglia still had a long way to go until 6am.I headed towards the meeting\npoint, where apparently a message awaited me, but was\ndistracted by Dave Pearce at the Radio 1 stage.\nImagine approaching an open air stage, with around\nthree hundred people dancing in front of it. Behind you\n'Ericsson' is emblazoned on a hillside in huge 'how-many-kilowatts?' white light. In front of you there's a silly inflatable man, who in the last remnants of dusk seems to be\ndancing to the house/trance coming out of the sound s ys tem. You dance your way to the front and suddenly think\n\"wouldn't it be cool if he played Greece 2000: Three Drives next?\" If you were listening to Radio 1 that night, the\ncheers over the first few beats may well have been mine...\nSometime around midnight one of our group decided\nto fork out \u00a350 and do a bungee. At night. After dancing\nin a field all day. After taking God knows what in the way\nof consumables. Silly fellow. He survived the drop, how-ever, describing the experience as \"quite cool\". Clearly too\nmany drugs...\nMeanwhile in the tent nearest us DT is approaching\nthe halfway mark. Suddenly I realise I 've missed Paul Oakenfold. Doh. Fortunately he is on again later in the night.\nThen I realise what we're really missing. Sasha? No, that\nwill have to wait until next year - now Is the moment for...\n1am The Chemical Brothers: So who doesn't like 'Hey Boy,\nHey Girl'? I thought so. Ed and Tom know so, and thousands crammed into the tent to witness their skills. They\nwere, of course, superb. The only criticism, however, is that\ntheir old tunes don't seem to work well alongside the\nnewer stuff, leading to a slightly disjointed set. The last tune\nwas The Private Psychedelic Reel', stretched out with rises,\nriffs and ridiculous 303 noises, climaxing in an al might ly beatles s screech of synth as the lights came on full and\nthe crowd roared. Whatever they lack in continuity and\ndress sense they more than make up for in sheer performance.2 am Fatboy Slim: Following directly on from the brothers\nin the Home tent, Monsieur Cook played a fairly reserved\nset, sticking to the bread and butter of Leftfield and how\nown tunes, occasion n aly adding some diversity. Good stuff,\nbut I still reckon he's better at making music than mixing\nit.\nSomehow we all managed to find each other around\n3am and plan the last few hours. I had missed Dope Smugglaz and Pete Tong, but you can't have everything In life.\nCarl Cox was playing hard house and techno in an End tent,\nthe atmosphere of which was reminiscent of those heady\nfirst year days at Club UK's Friday night ers. A quick look in\nat Basement Jaxx in the Mixmag tent revealed, well, not\nmuch - who hyped them up to me so much? At this stage\nthe Union flu was beginning to take its toll, as was the lack\nof sleep, and I found myself shivering in the pre-dawn chill.\nSome coffee and a walk later, I suddenly realised.., I had missed Paul Oakenfold! Again! Double doh! I waited\naround for the Radio 1 sound stage to start up again - Annie\nNightingale was supposed to be playing a dawn set - but\nit remained dormant until the close for reasons I have yet\nto discover.\nMeanwhile Laurent Gamier and Swift were finishing\noff the last two hours in the End tents, but our heads were\nin no state to take hat d beats, so we opted for the more\nuplifting trance of Paul van Dyk. Although I spent much\nof the last hour huddled under a blanket in the middle of\nthe dance floor (a very strange perspective on club culture\nindeed), most of our party stayed upright to the rather\nsweet end, and danced, jumped, waved and screamed to\n'For an Angel' and whatever else the Dyk threw at us.\nI felt three drops of rain all night which, considering\nhalf of southern England experienced monsoon-like\nstorms, was quite good. To paraphrase NME, God may not\nbe a DJ but he's certainly not averse to a spot of dance\nmusic in afield. The heavy sponsorship from Ericcson and\nvery good organisation gave the entire event a very pro-fess ional, un tra modern feel. I couldn't even grumble at\nthe half hour wait to get out of the car park - after all, it\ntakes time to move 30,000 people who have been dancing all night.\nThe technology was awesome - each tent had cameras stationed behind the decks and around the arena,\nbroadcasting images of the DJ mixing onto huge screens\nat the front. In the Ericsson tent you could see what was\nhappening in all the arenas at once on a selection of TV\nscreens. The laser and light set up was, well, expensive.\nAnd best of all, everyone enjoyed it - even the First Aid\ntent was chilled when I popped in at 2am to get some\npa race te mol. If you are around in September, I would recommend Homelands near Edinburgh. If not, I 'll see you\nin afield next year...\n\n"

Although last month's picket had little effect on IC, its primary\naim was to make employers aware of\nthe staff's anger.

As well as being\nagainst UCAS regulations this\napproach would result in administrative chaos leaving institutions with\nonly a vague idea of which students to\nexpect for the new year.

Recently Kevin took\na group of IC students off the campus\nto a real pub, where\ninevitably a good proportion of the customers were over\nthe age of 23. The\nstudents had apparently never experienced the behaviour\nof drunk thirty-some-things before, and\nwere certainly not\nimpressed by what\nthey saw. They found\nthis environment\nIntolerable and were begging to return\nto their safe student-y world as quickly\nas possible.\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nderive Maxwell's equations in terms of\nthe speed of light, during which Kevin\nreturned to snooze mode.\nFireworks Please\nThe new dean of the\nRoyal College of Science has suggested\nthat the RCSU should\nhold an event for\nbonfire night next\nyear. The new Dean\nis the professor in\ncharge of Imperial's Plasma Physics\nGroup. Kevin anticipates that a fireworks\ndisplay organised by\nthe Imperial College\nPlasma Physics group should be a seriously impressive spectacle.\nDemocracy in Action\nEvery so often something happens to\nKevin that reminds him what a brilliant\nplace London is. This week it was the\nEuropean Elections that enraptured\nKevin. Where else but In London - the\nheart of our eccentric and developed\ndemocracy - would the process of voting be so much fun? Kevin found the\nwhole process rather amusing, especially as the ballot paper was about\nthree foot long, longer than the desk in\nthe polling booth. On unrolling the\nscroll-like ballot paper, 150 candidates\nand 15 parties, along with their corresponding logos and paragraph of election drivel confronted Kevin.\nHaving located the appropriate location for his cross, the next challenge was\nto get the paper into the ballot box,\nwhich had obviously been designed for\npapers of more modest proportions.\nKevin was dismayed to hear that it is\napparently trendy to say that you don't vote In European Elections. Most of\nKevin's fellow students, being wannabe\ntrendies, didn't bother to vote.\nKevin hopes that the slightly guilty\ntones in which pathetic excuses for not\nvoting were made indicates that there\nis some hope left. With better publicity,\nand increased awareness, perhaps in\nfuture students will not let their chance\nto influence the way their society is run\npass by so lightly.\nW ell it's almost over, probably\nthe most bizarre year in my\nlife. So I thought I'd reflect\non the year that's been.\nWhen I first got the job, I saw the\nUnion as a cheap place for a good\nnight out, great fun to work in and not\nmuch else. I'd never got around to\njoining a club or society, although the\nidea did appeal to me, and I'd only\never voted in the elections on the\nbasis of good posters. If you had\nasked me then my opinion of anyone\nholding a post in the student union,\nthe reply would have been the standard uninformed generalisation, that\neveryone was a hack.\nBy the time the summer came, I already had a reputation as being anti-medic, despite my frequent social visits to their bars. And then it hit me.\nWhat the hell was I going to do for a whole year? The man er in which I was\nelected had allowed me to get through\nhustings and the like without actually\nforming any policies and my knowledge of how I could implement them\nif I did have any was limited to my\nThe Importance of Pullovers\nKevin was dozing in a Physics lecture\nrecently, when the lecturer succeeded\nin grabbing the attention of the whole\nlecture theatre by announcing: \"Things\nare about to get serious, so I'm going\nto take off my pullover for this next\nbit.\" On removal of his multi coloured knitwear the lecturer proceeded to\nDazed & Confused\nWorking in South Kensington, Imperial\nCollege students regularly find themselves dealing with lost tourists. Kevin\nhas noticed that some students are\nunwittingly and unintentionally confusing these lost souls. When confronted\nby lost Americans on Imperial College\nRoad searching for the Science\nMuseum, the response of an IC student is typically to turn towards the\nChemistry building, point directly at the\nScience Museum, ignoring the buildings in the way, and say \"that way.\"\nWhich leaves your average tourist utterly\nbemused and confused.\nAnother common source of lost\nindividuals is Prince Consort Road,\nwhere often there are people looking\nfor the Royal Albert Hall. Bizarrely this\noccurs even at times when the answer\nis simply to follow the other people\nwearing turbans / Salvation Army uniforms / Christian yo of dog tags / dinner\njackets, or whatever 'uniform' the people attending the event happen to be\nwearing.\nI 'll Be Back\nKevin has been promised that he will be\nreturning to Felix next year. To conclude\nthis year, Kevin would like to congratulate Mr Hellard, on being a popular, efficient, clued up, generally \"Fantastic\"\nPresident. Most students are not aware\nof the more boring aspects of the President's job, and when the person in\nthe job is not a self-publicist, a lot of the\nwork can appear to go una c knowl edged. Kevin would like to see Tasha,\nher cronies, and her flat mates do as\ngood a job impartially running ICU next\nyear.\nAnd on that bombshell, we depart.\nPresidential Talk-Back\nThe Hellard Era Comes To An End\ncrash course in\nhow to b lag that you know\nsomething about the\nUnion, purely\nbased on past\ncopies of Felix\nand a few council minutes.\nLuckily Andy had left\nme with a few 1\ntoys to play\nwith. The dB's redevelopment\nwas well underway and the\ncontract for the\nUniversity of\nLondon Union was still\nunsigned and\nthen the hardest realisation of my life occurred: Having relied just on cramming for the\nprevious two years, I might actually\nhave to do some work.\nThe rest of\nthe story starts\nto get boring\nand, if you've\nbeen reading\nFelix, hopefully\nyou'll know\nmost of it. I have formulated some opinions along\nthe way,\nthough, and\nbecome as bitter and twisted\nas even Mr\nBaker. Firstly, I don't believe in\nthe conspiracy\nthat the College\nare all ganging\nup in an\nasserted effort\nto get the\nUnion. I do however believe that the\nUnion is an after thought for them,\nseen as a thorn in their side and if they\nwant something we have, they will\nhave no qualms trying to take it from\nus. Just look at the Union Bookshop,\nJunior Common Room Refurbishment,\nthe Southside Gym and possibly even\nthe Newsagent.\nSecondly though, I have realised\nthat apart from the few individuals in\n'Union Politics' for its sheer thrill and\nrush, most people in Union positions\nare involved for selfless reasons and\nwithout their input the Union would be\ncrumbling.\nI will now predictably try and sell\nthe Union, but at least it's easy to.\nUntil this year, I never realised how\nmuch the Union can help the average\nstudent's life. Whether in looking for\naccommodation, fighting an academic\nappeal or even meeting graduate\nt ecru it ers, the Union has the mechanisms and expertise to help you along\nevery step of the way.\nSo do I think I did a good job? I'd rather not comment, but I 've enjoyed\nit and I got to spend a whole year living only ten meters away from a pint\nof Carlsberg... a Carlsberg for only\n\u00a31.18 at that.\n\n"

'I know\" quoth he \"why don't we do a review of the year for the\nlast issue? We can tell people how the games we've reviewed have stood up to\nthe test of time: what is and isn t still on our hard disk.\" My response is unrecorded,\nprobably because I was at that moment sliding beneath the table, a glazed but happy\nlook in my eyes.\nA few months and several additional IPAs later, and here we are,- the last Issue\nunder current management. For obvious reasons we, the writers, are devastated.\nWe feel as though our world has disintegrated about us. We spend many hours of\nhard labour creating a thing of beauty and fascination for you and now it's all gone.\nExcept for this final issue. We have to soldier on,- to grit our teeth and wipe away\nthe tears until our duty Is done and we depart the office into the lonesome twilight\nbemoaning our empty shell-like lives and cast aimlessly around in search of an alternative raison d'et re.I quite enjoyed writing that. But to the games...\nThe early days of light\nCheers for that Danny. Well it all started for me as\nfar back as ECTS in September, the twice yearly\nexcuse for software companies to spend lots of\nmoney on entertaining the UK's finest writing talent and several assorted newspaper journalists.\nThe mood was upbeat even If Sega and EA could-n't be bothered to strut their stuff, possibly\nbecause Eidos treated us to the real Lara Croft.\nBut yes, the games. The first five issues presented us with a odd assortment of games. There\nwas the rather excellent Red Alert - Retaliation for\nthe Playstation. A game that started a thousand\nargue ment s and led to an illegal betting ring in my\nflat. With just 2 PSX's and 2 TV's you too can start\nyour own border conflict knowing that the only collateral damage sustained will be the controller hitting the floor after your mates beat you for the\num teen th time. Then there was what Westwood\nStudios did next, or what they did a long time ago Lara silences over enthusiastic\nbut this time a little prettier. Dune 2000.

Carmegeddon 2 was brutally underscored and only given a single star (at least\nthree stars less than its actual worth in my\nopinion), but the true holder of the golden\nturkey turd award was Creatures 2, which\ncombined the excitement of watching grass\ngrow with the need for constant attention that a nuclear power station re\neven trying to kill the fake fur creatures in original and painful ways live\nhours I battled with tedium.\nThe weird game of this era - though t tier e was\nnever time for a review - was Kula World, a bouncy ball in a3D world. A puzzle game well\nworth getting worked up over, under and\nround the bend for. Weirdness oozes from it,\nwith time pills that make the screen go all wi b bly and wobbles the dual shock pad, and\nmunch y sounds when the ball eats fruit...\none for the after pub sessions and not the\ncold light of day.\ni th.\nFuturecop: LAPD\nBig guns, big machines, big fun.\nThe short good Christmas days\nThis was a time when every game from the\nwestern hemisphere gets released within\na four week period, or at least that's how\nit started to feel. The five issues up to\nChristmas was also a rich and bountiful\ntime for the four and five star brigade\nwith Actua Golf 3, Tenchu, Medievil,\nMicrosoft's Combat Flight Simulator, TOCA\n2 and Heretic 2 all getting the fours while\nFuturecop - LAPD, Wargasm, Settlers 3,\nPopulous - tTe Beginning and Grim Fandango getting top marks.\nOf all those some of them have been\nburning their images into the screen longer than others. Tenchu is still near the top\npile of PSX games in the living room, if only\nfor the pure grim and dark nature of watching the ninjas perform the special instant\ndeath moves on unsuspecting employees\nthat get in the way. TOCA 2 also occasionally gets an outing, though only when I have trouble finding Grand Tourismo and\nneed a quick car fix.\nFrom the five star crew I have to admit\nthat only Futurecop - LAPD gets regular\noutings especially for the two player battle\ngame, and usually to settle the argument\nof whose turn it is to clean the flat (A fairly\nregular argue ment really). Wargasm, while\nbeing impressive graphically, was just too difficult for my console soaked brain,\nTen chu: Stealth Assassins\nThe knife Is not Just for cutting bread\nWargasm\nIt sounds rude.\nGrim Fandago\nLucusArts' finest go 3D. though part of the problem could well be the force feedback joystick turning my\narm muscles to the consistency and strength of jelly within moments. Grim Fandango\ndisappeared off to Hong Kong with David Howell - a bit too far to travel for the occasional and casual game. Populous, well that was Danny's. My initiation into the world of Felix reviewing was Populous - The Beginning, which\nI rated quite highly at the time. It still\nresides on my hard disk, although I can't claim to play it continuously. It's still an\nenjoyable chunk of code, and the graphics are very nice, particularly when you\nhave a3D card to help things along. But\nit gets damn hard very quickly, and I don't know anyone who's finished it.\nPopulous - The Beginning\nGod Sims: The Previous Generation\nRed Alert: very special - enough said.\nAmong the rest of the mass of 3 star games Bruce Willis put in a performance\nin the shooter Apocalypse- absolutely nothing to do with asteroids and blowing them\nup. That was Activision's updated Asteroids game - something still good for the occasional and quick blast.\n\n"

Look for Aian Mullally, Darren\nGough and Alex Tudor to lead the bowl-ing, and Graham Thorpe, Mark Rampraksh and Mark Butcher the batting.\nThe selectors need to find another opener if Mike Atherton's back hasn'the a led, and they need to decide whether they want to use Ben Hollioake, or Andrew Flintoff or neither as\nthe numb re6/ all rounder position.\nAlec Stewart probably won't be keeping anymore, so expect either\nPaul Nixon(Leics) or prospect Chris\nRead(Notts) to be behind the stumps.\nWith regard to New Zealand, they\nhave a good bowling attack with the hostile Simon Doull, the World Cup's leading wicket taker Geoff Allot, and young left arm spinner Daniel Vettorl\n(think milky bar kid - that's who he looks\nlike).\nThere batting, however, is much weaker.

Admittedly\nyou cannot blame Keegan entirely\nbecause the qualification process started under the then slightly mad Glenn Hoddle and was far too soon after the end of the Wotld Cup. if Keegan has a full squad avail-able, then the potential lineup could theoretically be good enough to beat\nanyone. The trick is Keegan needs to\nrecapture the spirit and attacking ability of the Newcastle United from a few years back( Remember them? They were really exciting and then Kenny Dalglish took over). If he can do that then Seaman, Southgate, Adams and Campbell can take care of the defence.

Song titles like\nWheelkings 1973, Police Car Sex, Mph Is\nEverything and Blue Chrome Zoo serve\nto illustrate this quite clearly. The first\ntwo of this bunch have been relatively\nlow-key singles although upon hearing\nthem, you'll realise you' re more familiar\nwith them than you think. The rest of this album takes a bit of time to get hold of, though. Despite occasional road-rage rushes\nand some very funky organ work, One Lady Owner verge on being Goth-rock.\n(Yeah, I bet you' d forget all about that,\nhad n't you? Sisters of Mercy and all that.)\nThe vocalist is far too dreary - at times you\nbegin to wonder why you aren't actually\ngetting your head down for some much needed kip instead of force feeding yourself a dose of bland rock.\nHowever, I can see this being some people's cup of tea. It just doesn't do it\nfor me, that's all. Tracks seem to blend into each other making one see mun recognisable from the other. I'm sure\npeople think the same sort of thing about Embrace, though. In summary, this is a dark atmospheric rock album with a tendency to\noccasionally hit the throttle but more than happy to purr through the music streets. I rec commend you don't use it\nfor long journeys, though, as it may cause drowsiness. As for heavy machinery, I'd steer clear of that, as well.

Witness area very\ndifferent sound to Embrace but the impact they have on the listener is\nbound to be the same. Tracks are built from simple beginnings and rounded off into beautiful\nsongs. The lyrics are all aching to be taken seriously. They're also delivered\nalmost effortlessly, feeling no need for\nvocal acrobatics. It's a fine line between pretentiousness and genuine humility\nbut I think Witness perform the tightrope\nact almost to perfection. I say almost\nbecause throughout you do get the feeling that they know that they're something special waiting to explode. They\ndon't flaunt it, though. Metaphorically,\nthey sit around in a room with knowing smiles, happy with what they've created.\nAnd happy they should be, for what\nwe have here is a glorious collection of sound that transcends the crowded sonic\nmarketplace that is music's current cli-mate. Haunting chimes crop up throughout the album, addingto tracks by emphasising their delicacy and fragile\nnature. In fact, So Far Gone is so delicate,\nyou feel like it's about to break down right before your very ears. It's perfect\ncomedown music. Before The Calm,\nclever title though it is, is probably not the\nmost accurate description of this album. I think right slam bang in the centre of the fuckin' calm would have been more appropriate. Cause and Effect maintains\nthe self-pity: ' Why do you still hang around when you' ve let all your friends\ndown?' This song however, builds into a screeching crescendo before descending\nand returning to the beginning. My\nFriend Will See Me Through makes up for\nthe apparent negativity of Cause and\nEffect and at the end of the day, the sound that's been born here is all about\nthe triumph of the human spirit. We' ve all been down at some point. Some down more than others. What matters is\nhow we' ve risen from that low or whether we' ve sunk further. Do yourself\na favour and take time out of your day to listen to Before The Calm. It's got more message in its sound than that\nspoken word track that people believe to be splattered with pearls of wisdom. The problem with Witness is that this\nis not their time. Nobody really wants to listen to this type of music. We' ve had The Verve and to a lesser extent, we had\nEmbrace. Too often, I feel, Witness will\nbe dismissed as pretentious chance rs when they are actually musical chance rs with a sound that is worthy and soulful.\nThis is most certainly not their time, as\nthey appear to be too cool and people aren't swayed by image today at all (!)\nHowever, if musicians thought that it\nwasn't their time and that no-one would accept their music then we'd end up with some absolute drivel. Tfie way for-ward is to always create something new that might not be liked. Good luck Witness -1 think you'll need it.

    "content": "23 June 1999 Music 41\nSingles Round Up\nPeshay - Switch\nThis track begins with an opening nearly\nexactly the same as which Adam F prefers and then leads into a fairly standard step up drum and bass. It's pleasant enough but probably best left to the\ndance floors and not to your stereo at\nhome.\nThe Autuers - 7he Rubettes\nAlthough The Rubettes contains The\nAuteurs' distinctive sound which even\ntinges a cheerful song with their trademark subtle darkness. The\nRubettes sounds Hike the name of an\nearly '60s band and you guessed it, so\ndoes this song.\nHefner - The Hymn for the Cigarettes\nA song about your girlfriend smoking\nfags in bed, quitting those packs of\ntwenties and being in love, all done with\na typical sub-standard indie sound.\nThere is a bonus however as one of the\nband members wrote a recipe for meatballs in tomato sauce inside the sleeve.\nNow why hasn't this been done before?\ndEUS - Sister Dew\nThis is the second release from dEUS'\nrecent LP, The Ideal Crash. It has the\nsemblance of a ballad and strives for\nepic like proportions but does not quite\nreach its goal. Don't expect any chart\nsuccess, instead go out and buy the\nalbum, you won't be disappointed.\nCutLaRoc-Mattn'/fW of T.C. Islam is featured on this track\nreleased through the Skint record label,\nthe home to your Big Beat fave s. As with\nthe Peshay track I'd be up there dancing away to this in a club but for listening at home this just doesn't cut it.\nSolex - Randy Costanza\nThis is not easy to categorise, and admittedly I don't like to do so, but the closest description that comes to mind is\n'quirky lo-fi indie'. I believe a clarinet is\nused along with the traditional guitars,\ndrums and bass, which are all spoiled by\na singer with one of those e xter em ely annoying voices. El\nJason\nBellatrlx - Crash\nThey look like a band that would play\nalternative music but I was surprised to\nhear hard and fast beats carefully put\ntogether with a lavish helping of sharply\nvocals to produce a fresh sound that\nwould probably go down a storm in a club (but minus the vocals though). Their\nsound could be deceiving though; the b side reveals the expected indie.\nShed Seven - Disco Down\nTaken from their forthcoming greatest\nhits album Going For Gold, this has got\nthat 70s feel to it, but the Shed's manage to pull it into the nineties with style.\nThis will quickly get you into the flares\nand out to a disco (and you better hurry\nif Shed 7 get their way - they want to burn\nall the discos down).\nAnother Level - From The Heart\nFeature song to the new Hugh\nGrant/Julia Roberts film Notting Hill. I don't know, I guess I have to be a girl to\nappreciate these boy-bands and especially these cheesy love songs. The song\nisn't too bad, but It isn't too good either.\nIn any case, why would anyone want to\nbuy this and listen to this over and over?\nKristin Hersh - Echo\nSinger, songwriter and producer, and\nnot a bad one at that either. The varying\ntempo keeps you on edge - the soft\nparts entertain a familiar keyboard\narrangement but before you fall off the\nedge the drum beats battle with your\neardrums. She teases: \"Do you hear the\nloudest sound?\" - er, yes, thanks Miss\nHersh.\nWide Angle - Diablo\nWide in angle perhaps but definitely narrow in mind - don't they know that\nrecording crap music will earn them no\nfans. This is just guitars making the typical melody we get in rock and the vocals\nare not earth-moving. They should probably have switched tracks one and three.\nThe Blood is a much better tune - the guitars are finely played and the vocals ride\non a cool melody.\nLuscious Jackson - Ladyflngers\nA fresh slice of pop from a charming all-girl New York threesome. Known to be\nfriends with the Beastie Boys but their\nlyrics are definitely much sexier, although\nwe may expect some experimental traits\nto rub off onto them. I can't wait to get\nhold of their forthcoming album Electric\nHoney.\nJamlroqual - Canned Heat\nI don't really need to say much about this\none. Entered the chart at No. 4 and probably still doing the rounds in the charts\nby the time you read this. A stunning\nsummer song and Jay Kay's vocals are still\nCardigans - Hanging Around\nThis is an excellent song. Lead singer\nNina Personn definitely has got something catchy about her voice. Get this\nsingle if you want to snap only this song\nas uplifting as ever - the opening line\n'You know this boogie is for real' just says\nit all really. Their album Syncronized will\nprobably also be released by the time\nyou read this.\nNew Electrics - Get Together\nThis track opens with vibrant guitars but\nthe vocals are really dull. It does get better as the track progresses and with a few\nmore listens. At exactly three minutes\nlong, it not long enough to really get into\nit and it always finishes just as you do. If\nthe b side's anything to go by, there's not\nmuch more where that came from.\nSuede - She's In Fashion\nFrom their current Headmusic album,\nyou'll probably buy this anyway if you're\na Suede fan. Otherwise, don't bother.\nThis isn't one of their strongest songs\nand doesn't even sound good enough\nfor a single. Suede can definitely do better than this,- I hope this isn't representative of their album.\nCay - Prince & Princesses\nThere were three tracks on this CD and\nno sooner than I pressed play it was all\nover. The three tracks total a time of\nunder seven minutes. These are incredibly short songs! Mind you, that's probably not a bad thing for these were not\nparticularly good listening. The presented\nrock is nothing new and the vocals will\nnot be missed if they were never voiced\nagain. EI\nAsad\noff their Gran Turismo album 'cos it features no other tracks. Two mixes sound\nalmost the same but the Naid Remix is\na bittersweet treat.\nBeverley Knight - Greatest Day\nI am not very keen on soul and R&B, but\nI do recognise some familiar selling-points on this single. It sounds kinda\ngood and has an almost Motown feel to\nit. Feel-good kind of stuff, or is it?\nHurricane #1- Remote Control\nThis single has got three remixes of\nRemote Control. I don't quite like the\nmood of this song and it doesn't strike\nme as melodic. The band may have\nsome potential though and their album\nmay well be a good one. Twilight World,\nDon't Worry, and Indian Water Song are\nalso on this single.\nMase (feat. Blackstreet) - Get Ready\nThis is supposed to be a really cool rap\nartist! Alas, nothing original, not even\ndecent rehashing of older music. Apart\nfrom the title track, the single features\nFeel So Good and What You Want which\ndo not help in redeeming the record,\nthough the latter would make a nice\ncruiser of a song.\nJamella - / Do\nFusion of latin and R&B. That doesn't make it sound less similar to lots of\nthe stuff getting airplay. It just never\nmanages to rise above the mediocre.\nShe can sing, the beats roll, the bass\ntones swing, but we've heard this a1001 times before.\nDark Star - About 3am New British band. Enjoyed the song and\nthe single very much. Confident and\ndark music with good singing abilities.\nDark Star project a similar musical experience to that of listening to Pink Floyd.\nHenry Beckett and Light Years also feature on this single. El\nAhmed\n\n"

Their mixed-up, muddled up tunes seizing the Zeitgeist of spiralling-a morphism where pop-music currently\nresides.\nTheir raison s d'e tre of sculpting unique songs from a melting pot of gen res, ranging from dance music to main stream pop, is stil i very much in evi-den ce. From the techno informed Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\nand the drum and bass sound of The\nDoor To This House Remains Open to the compelling glam-rocker Do Or Die.\nSuch diversity is prevalent throughout,\nCheck It Out contains a Young MCs am ple, Northern Lites features steel drums\nand latino rhythms. Specific Ocean has\nsynthetically altered vocals and Chewing Chewing Cum opens with a jew-ellery-box piano before transforming into\nan ethereal, mell i fluent sing-a long.\nHowever, it is the protracted and more reflective songs that are of the greatest interest, disclosing a world-weariness first made evident on their\nprevious album Radiator (for similar The\nEnd Of The World Is Nigh intonations listen to the Beta Band's self-titled debut).\nSomething's Come from Nothing and Turning Tides hint at unrest and disillusionment, painting a somewhat resigned\noutlook.\nThis is by far SFA's most emotive work, adding a new precision and clarity to their lyrics; the honeyed fire In My\nHeart refrain of T got pins and needles\nfor you/I 've got butterfly stomach for\nyou/And as clouds fly by, I just break\ndown and cry' pricks the teat ducts from\nits angelic package of a tune.\nWhile the similarly polymorphic Beta\nBand offer apparently extemporaneous, yet courageous and worthwhile, fare,\nSFA exude an air of calculated purpose amid the confusion. Show some faith\nand buy this record. H Chris\nLO FIDELITY ALLSTARS\nOn The Floor At The Boutique\nComparisons with Fat Boy Slim\nIn abundance that's something to cheer about!\nF or anyone lucky enough to have\nbeen to the Big Beat Boutique in\nBrighton they will know that it is\ncurrently one of the best club nights on the planet. Packed with a young crowd all up for a good time, the Boutique has\nproved that it is certainly the place for\nc lubbers who remember the real reason clubbing became so popular in the1980 s. The music style of the djs\nemployed is not of the snobby attitude\nso often heard in many clubs where the dj tries to impress the crowd by playing\nrecords noone else has managed to get their hands on, for without exception The Boutique djs play the music the crowd want to hear. The music selection in turn inspires the crowd to dance as crazily as possible, get as fucked up as possible (on drink or drugs) and just\nhave an absolutely amazingly great\ntime.\nWith the On the Floor at the Boutique series, the Skint label is trying to create a take home package of the feeling\nof their club by providing compilations\ncreated by their mixing maestros. The first in the series was compiled by none other than Skint super artist Fat Boy Slim,\nand now the second comes from the equally talented, if not quite as popular,\nLo-Fidelity Allstars. Following in the steps\nof the Fat Boy is not as easy job for any-'\none to handle, but the Lo-Fidelity Allstars have done themselves proud. Their\nmix is as seamless as one could possibly\nhope, and the tracks chosen remain perfectly complimentary to each other, while\nstill managing to surprise with tracks you would never expect to hear in a club.\nOf course, the beats remain as big\nas possible throughout the entire mix\nand who would expect anything else?\nThere are contemporary tracks from the wonderfully English (not French) Les\nRythmes Digitales, Skint's own Indian\nRope man, and the Lo-Fi's also manage to throw in a couple of their own offerings as well. However, it is the selection\nof the old tunes that really lift the mix\nfrom the average level that only the best\ndance mix compilations manage to sur-pass. The listener is treated with classics\nfrom the Jungle Brothers, Sugarhill hip-hop grand daddies Trouble Funk, and some further inspired choices including\nconsecutive tracks from The Tarns and The Prodigy where Be Young Be Foolish\nBe Happy is mixed into the st on king Outta Space.\nThis second release in the On the\nFloor of the Boutique series thus p to ves to be exactly everything it sets to be. Although are no funny little three diam on d stamped pills in the package, or a voucher for copious quantities of alcohol,\nthis mix cd is the first step to creating\nyour own Big Beat Boutique at homed James\nFUZZ TOWNSHEND\nFar In\n:\".;>.VC'V:'i.l'^ H'e yyy'y/ iy\nheard last vc-ar? v\\<..

It started so very very well\nwhen Halflife finally fell into one Games\nEditor's grubby little paws. So I might not\nhave played it across the net but to echo\na well remembered line, \"Frankly my dear\nI don't give a damn\". Halflife is still my\nfavourite single player first-person shooter.\nIt might slow up when every known evil\nthroughout this and other world is in view,\nbut that is only because I 'chose to ignore\nthe little sticker with the required system\ninformation and ran it anyway. The\nLucasarts Star Wars cash cow turned out another arcade-like 3D flyby shooting game,\nRogue Squadron, which while being very pretty was not especially long lasting and\ndid not really have the addictive gameplay\nof the better Star Wars games.\nEidos changed the rules of the management game with Gangsters, which\nappealed to the player who prefers information overload with their violence, especially watching several goons attempting\nto harass opponents, rob banks and generally do bad. It's not a bad game, just lacking the edge of a truely excellent addictive\nmanagement game. It was also during\nthese months that the compilations sprung up in the shops like early flowers. Danny\ngot to draw the short straw and got Blizzard's and LucasArts' back catalogue.\nFirst - the Blizzard three pack Starcraft, Warcraft 2 and Diablo. / said that the jewel in\nthis particular crown was Starcraft. However, the only still remaining on my hard\ndisk is Diablo, which has depths in it that\naren't revealed on a cursory play. At the\ntime I vaguely remember saying that it\nwas primarily designed for multiplayer ing, but after a certain amount of hard playing\nI 've discovered that tactics are the key to\nsingle player success. The other two are\ngood, but Diablo has proved Itself superior to both.\nX Wing Trilogy. These are gone. This shouldn't really come as a surprise as they've\nbeen replaced in grand style by X WIng\nAlliance. Quite apart from which all of\nthese games are at least two years old and\nthings have moved on. Still worth buying\nif your PC can't run Alliance though.\n\u2022\nit and am still intrigued by the story line.\nDefinitely one for the collection.\nAlpha Centauri. Again a stay er.I stand by my over-the-top review. Buy it\nand cherish it. Real life is far less inter-e sting. Baldur's Gate:\nDungeons and Dragons for one\nThere was also SimCity 3000. With spiced\ngraphics and options aplenty it was now\npossible to build your own city, and destroy\nit in extreme detail.\nFinally Natural Fawn killers deserves a mention. This was the worst game seen this year. Not only was it tasteless - not necessarily a crime in itself - but it was the worst excuse for a3D accelerated game ever.\nThe Gold Turkey Turd prize goes to this and this game alone. May every copy be\nleft in the bargain basement bin in Electronic Boutiques all round the country.\nThe Sharp Spring shocks\nDiablo:\nHidden depths found in Dungeon I Tie Fighter:\nCreaking Its way Into a early grave\nSo hope springs eternal. Only three games\n| this term managed to get top dog scores.\nWarzone 2100 managed to take the Red\nAlert Crown which Westwood Studios had\nleft unguarded for so long. With the ability to design and build your own force out\nHI of custom components and then view the\nbattle field from what ever view you want,\nWarzone 2100 : it still stands as the game to beat - and with\nThe smell of gunfire Is never far away 2 CD's of the single player game there is\na large amount of game to beat. Wipeout\n64 was one of two race games to get a maximum score. It might be a enhanced\nversion of the old PSX Wipeout 2 but its\nquality shines through. Danny unfortunately had to wade through a crop of four\nstar games.\nX Wing Alliance. It would be very surprising if this had been replaced, and it has-n't. It is the best space fight game out\nthere at the moment (although it's not\nlong until Microsoft release Starlancer,\nwhich promises to give Alliance a run for Wipeout 64 :\nits money) and as such deserves to be in Top ban anna everyone's collection.\nCivilisation - Call to Power has been gathering bouquets from the rest of the\ngames press. I still think Alpha Centauri (or\ncome to that Civilisation Dare superior. It\nain't taking up space on my machine any\nmore.\nThief-The Dark Project\nCrime does pay...\nBut there were original games out. Thief\ntook the sneak-em-up genre of Tenchuwhere running into a fight was a sure way\nto be left bleeding on the floor - and\nadded an almost perfect audio engine to\na superb graphics chassis. If there is one\ngame this year which sums up atmosphere in a game, and demon states how a game can completely absorb the player within itself then this would be it.\nTenchu finally got replaced as my action game for the Playstation by Metal Gear\nm Solid. It might be spaced over 2 CD's, have\nvery cheesy dialogue and plot lines transparent to anyone over the age of 10, but\nits detail and gameplay is very difficult to\nimagine being beaten on the Playstationever. Roll on the Playstation 2. There was\nalso a severe do lop of excellent strategy\ngames.

    "content": "36 Books 23 June 1999\nNOVEL WITH COCAINE\nby M. Ageyev\nNovel With Cocaine\nwas written in the\nearly thirties, but\nthis is the first time it has\nbeen published here.\nThis edition contains an\nintroduction by author\nand literary critic Will Self,\nwhich is heavy on psychological musings, and\nworth reading for its\ndescription of the book\nas \"a text the genesis of\nwhich Is exactly congruent with its own queered\nontology.\" Answers on a postcard...\nThis is a strange\nbook in many ways.\nNothing is known about\nthe author, and it may or\nmay not be auto bi or graphical. It follows the\nlife of a young Russian,\nVadim, as he finishes\nschool and becomes addicted to cocaine, set in 1917\nMoscow.\nThis is, in essence, a remarkably\nmodern story of teen angst; drugs,\nwomen and self-loathing are superimposed onto school and domestic\nlife. The different parts of the story\nseem to be tacked together without\nany regard for one another - there's little absolute timeframe, and the locations are vague. However, the plot is\nreasonably straightforward and the\nbook is a fairly easy read.\nVadim, the protagonist, is a rather\nun likable character,- he's selfish and\narrogant, behaves very badly towards\nhis ageing mother, and his self-pitying\nintrospection evokes distaste rather\nthan sympathy. He's a complex and\nwell-drawn character, just not an especially nice one. The overall effect is to\ndetach the reader from him, leaving\nthe book a little flat and vaguely\ndepressing.\nOn the other hand, the quality of\nwriting is excellent. Vadim's first experience with cocaine, in particular, is\nevocative, realistic and its analytic style\nis fascinating. The approach of an intelligent mind attempting to dissect and\nmake sense of what is happening to it\nhas been used before and since to\ngreat effect; here the attention to\ndetail and rich descriptive writing make\nthe sequence vivid and absorbing.\nThe writing alone makes this a worthwhile read; the story isn't exactly\ngripping, but it's a fascinating book.\nThis is a vaguely cautionary tale, but\nthe blame is placed more on Vadim's personality than any inherent dangers\nof drug usage. This will sit nicely alongside Naked Lunch, Fear and Loathing\nin Las Vegas and Trainspotting as a good example of the genre's roots.\nGareth\nPenguin 20th Century Classics, \u00a37.99\nrn mm QA WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR\nby John Irving\nA//f/l BOW FOR\nJohn Irving wrote The World According to Garp. Now I haven't read\nthis but I have heard of it, so he\nmust be quite famous. With this in\nmind I started reading his latest novel\nexpecting it to be at least well writ-ten... and it is.\nThe book is split\ninto three sections\nspread over a40 year\nperiod starting in 1958.\nThe characters in the\nbook are all writers (or\naspiring writers) and the\nstory is concerned with\nthe complex relations\nbetween them. In 1958,\na young college student\nbegins a vacation job\nas a writer's assistant to\na famous children's author, who is going through the process of\nseparating from his\nwife. The student\ncomes of age, as he\nbecomes a pawn\nbetween them. The\nrelationships described\nare very intense and the\nstory ranges from the\nsad through to the\nfunny. The summer\nends badly but the\nevents have a long-term effect on the\nstudent and the writer's four-year-old\ndaughter.\nThe next two sections of the\nbook are set in the 1990s and the\ncharacters have all moved on in the\nworld. Our young 'hero' from the\nfirst section is an average writer\nwhilst the much younger girl is\nhighly successful. The author again\nfocuses on the relationships\nbetween the characters, although this time the ages of the characters\nare reversed.\nMy main annoyance with the\nbook is a tendency by the author to\nleap about as the story progresses.\nThe timeline is therefore quite disjointed but not particularly difficult to\ngrasp.\nOne of the things I did like most\nabout the novel is the fact that all\nthe main characters are writers. This\nmeans that the main text is interspersed with readings or chapters\nfrom their own books. This proves to\nbe both entertaining and a useful\ntool for explaining some of their\nmotivations.\nOverall I would say that this is\nquite an enjoyable book to read and\nthat it will particularly appeal to\nthose with a love of emotive relationships or an interest in writing.\nChris\nPublished by Black Swan, \u00a37.99\nCD CD CD\nI have been informed By the engineers in the office that this is a Moebius strip...

    "content": "28 Summer Movie Preview 23 June 1999\nDespite the warnings of studios fleeing\nin the wake of The Phantom Menace,\nthere's still a decent raft of movies coming our way in July, with big budget\nhits like Austin Powers: The Spy Who\nShagged Me, The Mummy and Entrapment (page 24) just the tip of the Iceberg... Wing Commander is the\nbig-screen version of the computer\ngame of the same name, starring Freddie Prinze Jr and Matthew Lillard - like all\ngame conversions, it's probably pretty\nawful...not as bad, however, as Rogue\nTrader, the drama tis ation of Nick Leeson's fifteen minutes of fame, which\nfinally arrives two years late, due to the\npacked schedule of workaholic star\nEwan McGregor...on a grander scale.\nThe Thirteenth Warrior is the latest\nMichael Crichton adaptation to make it\nto the multiplexes, which features Antonio Banderas and a bunch of Vikings\nattempting to defeat the flesh-eating\n'monster of the mists'...on a lighter note,\n10 Things I Hate About You is yet\nanother high school set romantic com-ed y, staring the regulation set of incredibly good-looking hot young things in a movie that's billed, bizarrely, as an adaptation of Shakespere's The Taming of\nthe Shrew..from similar territory comes\nVarsity Blues, starring James Van Der\nBeck (familiar to all Dawson's Creek\nfans) and Jon Voight - this time it's College Football providing the in spira tion...the month's least family orientated\nmovie comes in the star-studded form\nof Ravenous, where Guy Pearce tries to\navoid becoming Robert Carlyle's dinner\nwhen he's posted to an isolated fort in\nthe blizzard battered old-west...a more\ntraditional western comes in the form of\nThe High-Lo Country, with an eclectic\ncast which includes Woody Harleson,\nPatricia Arquete and Billy Crudup...the\nonly movie to go up against Sfar Wars\non the 16th is 7he Polish Bride, the story\nof a woman who escapes her enforced\nwork in a brothel, only to find her past\nwon't leave her alone...The Match\ncomes straight from traditional Brit-flick\ncountry, with a novelty cast that Includes\nIan Holm, Tom Sizemore, Neil Morrissey\nand Richard E Grant as the members of\ntwo pub soccer teams playing to settle\na century-old grudge...much weirdness\ncan be expected of Last Night, which\nsees a group of people with very different ideas of how to face the end of\nthe world come together with only six\nhours until the world is expected to\nend...finally, Le Diner de Cons is this\nmonth's token foreign language film,\nwhich (in typically off-beat French style),\nrevolves around a weekly meal at which\nall the guests have to bring an 'idiot'\nwith them - whoever brings the 'idiot of\nthe evening' wins...\nTHE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\nRELEASE DATE : July 30\nSTARS: Mike Myers, Heather Graham,\nRobert Wagner, Rob Lowe\nDIRECTOR: M Jay Roach\nF or any fan of Austin Powers, the\nnews that Mike Myers' big-toothed hero is back comes as a God-send - particularly as, this time\naround, producers New Line have\ngiven Myers free reign (and a hefty\nbudget) to exercise his warped view of\nsixties London.\nWith Liz Hurley choosing not to\nreturn, kooky Boogie Nights star Heather\nGraham takes up sidekick duties as the\nsubtly named Felicity Shagwell. Meanwhile, Myers himself pops up in four different roles - as Powers, his arch-nemesis\nDr Evil, as ttan ge60's guru and as a henchman going by the name Fat Bastard. As Tony the Tiget would say,\nGrrrrrrrrreat.\nAs far as plot is concerned, it's time-travel time once again, with Powers\nforced to return to the sixties to recapture his mojo (which Dr Evil has stolen\nin an effort to incapacitate the testosterone driven crime-fighter). Joining\nhim on this quest are a variety of biz-za rely named characters: Ivana\nHumpalot (Third Rock From The Sun's Kristen Johnston), Mini-me (a three foot\ntall version of Dr Evil) and Robin Swallows (played by Gia Carrides). Plus\nRobert Wagner (Number 2), Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina), Seth Green (Dr\nEvil's troubled son Scott) and Cindy\nMargolis (one of the incredibly un-PC\nFembots) all return from the first movie.\nAnyhow, all that really matters is\nthat the enforced return to the sixties\nwill provide no-end of excuses for outrageous costumes, randomly placed\ndance-routines and, of course, much\nhilarity. Indeed, despite the general\ntrack-record of comedy sequels being\nless than enviable, the word from the\nStates would seem to be that Austin\nPowers 2 is just as funny as the original,\nmaking The Spy Who Shagged Me a definite must-see.\nTHE MUMMY\nRELEASE DATE : June 25\nSTARS: Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz,\nJohn Hannah\nDIRECTOR: Stephen Sommers\nt wouldn't be summer without a handful of movies based around\nsome nifty effects and pretty much\nnothing else - think Twister or Lost In\nSpace - and this year that grand tradition is kept alive by The Mummy.\nOwing a not inconsiderable debt to\nthe Indiana Jones trilogy. The Mummy\nfollows ex-Foreign Legionary Brendan\nFraser and brother-and-sister treasure\nhunting team Weisz and Hannah as\nthey trek across twenties North Africa.\nTheir goal is to rediscover The Hidden\nCity of Hamunaptra (which Fraser first\nstumbled on several years earlier), and\nhot on their trail are a group of\nunscrupulous Americans, intent on\nsecuring the City's treasures for them-selves. But - surprise, surprise - the City\nis cursed (are all lost cities cursed or\nsomething?) This time around, high\npriest Imhotep has been hanging\naround for 3000 years, having been\nmummified alive for getting a little too\nfriendly with Mrs Pharaoh - and, under-stand ably, he's a little miffed.\nSo, the tomb is opened, and Imhotep unleashes all the po wet at the\neffects crew's command - man eating\nscat abs, a massive sandstorm, and, of\ncourse, the CGI mummy itself. However, despite even the best efforts of\nIndustrial Light & Magic it's still going to\nbe a very hollow story. There's no\nromance (an integral part of any Indiana\nJones caper) and all three stars (particularly the usually reliable Hannah) are\napparently sorely underused. Ultimately,\nhowever, the greatest failing is to deliver\na grandiose big-budget period tale, shot\nin a variety of beautiful locations, that's totally devoid of atmosphere. Nonetheless, if zillion dollar action is your thing,\nor if you're looking for an easy means\nof escape from rainy-day London, then\ncheck-in with the first of this year's summer hits to makes its way across from\nthe US.\n\n"

    "content": "October\nThe year began with good news: London\nTransport announced its student discount\ndeal, now used by students throughout\nthe capital. There was a flip side, how-ever,- mat ute students were not to be\nincluded in the scheme, a decision\nstrongly opposed by ULU president Matt\nHyde. David Hellard, ICU President,\nhoped that the agreement could be\nextended to older students at a later\ndate,- he was to be proved right before\nhis presidency was over.\nThere was bad news for CCUs as\nthe term began. Resignations caused\nnumerous problems, particularly in the\nRCSU, who were rapidly running out of\ncommittee members by the end of the\nmonth. The BUSA hybrid entry debate\nwas still rumbling on from the previous\nyear, causing a certain amount of friction\nbetween ICSMSU and ICU. The only conclusion that everyone agreed on was\nthat merging institutions takes time. Lots\nof time. Relationships weren't helped by\nallegations concerning financial mismanagement of the Charing Cross summer ball, accusations fiercely denied at\nthe time by Nick Carter, the former\nDeputy President of ICSMSU.\ndent, Wade Gayed. it became clear, how-ever, that difficulties were partly caused\nby the merger of the medical campuses.\nWade Gayed rode out the storm, despite\nextreme pressure from all parts of the col-leg e. The Queen was impressed with the BMS\nControversy over the new building\ndidn't end there, however. The discovery\nthat the BMS and bookshop flowerbeds,\nand associated 'aesthetic enhance-ment s', were going to cost in excess of\n\u00a3100,000 caused a storm in Felix, finding\nits way into the letters pages, columns\nand editorial, and became an institutional is ed joke for the rest of the year.\nThe major story for fresher s was the\nintroduction of tuition fees, which put\nthem at a severe financial disadvantage\ncompared to their older peers. A glimmer\nof hope came in the Rector's announcement that Imperial would not charge\ntop-up fees, particularly welcome now it\nappears that Oxford are thinking of introducing them 'by the back door1 for some\nof their courses.\nOn a happier note the extension of\ndB's into Felix's former home, including\nthe construction of a new bar where the\nPrint Unit resided, was just completed in\ntime for fresher s week. Sighs of relief\nfrom the corridors of ICU could be heard\nin Battersea.\nRCSU Exec slowly faded away\nMeanwhile ICU had its own problems. Adam Cherrington, who was to be\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies), was\nforced to resign over the summer. His\nposition was eventually taken by Marie\nNicholaou late in the Autumn term, but\nnot before significant problems had\nbeen caused by the lack of a sabbatical.\nRAG also found itself without key players,\nbut recovered spectacularly as the term\nwent on, under the leadership of Sarah\nCoburn.\nCollege, too, faced difficulties. The\nBMS building was almost but not quite finished as fresher s started to arrive, prompting criticism from academic staff and\nFelix writers alike. Even when the Queen\ncame to officially open the 'Sir Alexander\nFleming' building there was a last minute\npanic, as one of the outside doors collapsed hours before she arrived, taking a sizeable chunk of a concrete pillar with it.\nCommemoration Day\nNovember\nAllegations of anti-medic reporting in\nFelix grew darker with the days. An article entitled \"Racism Rife in Medical\nSchools\" caused a stir on the letters page,\nprompting retaliatory letters from the\nSouth Ken community. The slang ing match culminated in a petition signed by\nover one hund ted medics, ruffling Felix's fur somewhat.\nBoth sides had their own problems,\nhowever. ICSMSU lost three exec members in a month, prompting questions\nover the competency of the ICSM PresiWade Gayed kept his head down\nAt the same time Felix was threatened with disciplinary action over the\nnow infamous Viz-style comic strip. After\nvarious letters and editorials Felix's editor\nadmitted defeat and withdrew it. Similar\npressure saw sport return to the back\npage. Felix was not the only student\nnewspaper facing criticism, however, as\nthe editor of Kings College's 'Roar' was\nsuspended following publication of the\n\"Catry on Cottaging - Basement Boys use\nBogs for Buggery\" issue.\nOn a happier note, RCSU finally\nelected a president (Simon Torn),\nrumours of a1999 summer ball began to\ncirculate, and David Hellard announced\nhis 'Discount Day', which has since led to\nsome decent reductions in many High St\nKen shops. RAG week had to be cancelled after the College refused to allow\nthe annual Beer Fest to take place in the\nnewly refurbished JCR, but by the end of\nthe month RAG was starting a slow recovery, setting up a50p cloakroom for Ents\nnights.\nStuart Cook was the only candidate\nto stand in the DP(C&S) election, which\nattracted minimal interest even by Imperial standards. In the end he quit an hour\nbefore the end of voting, his decision\ncoming after ICU Exec refused to allow\nhim to play football on Wednesday afternoons should he have won.\nincreased following reports that the Beit\nproject, which has now manifested itself\nin the form of hoarding s in the Quad,\ncould leave the Union substantially worse\noff for space then they had expected.\nThe flowerbeds fiasco culminated in a letter from Ian Caldwell, Director of Estates,\nto Felix; Simon Baker responded with a sharp critique of College's record on\nsuch matters in his column. The Voice of\nReason.\nLooking further afield, students from\nSouth East Asia, noticeably Malaysia,\nwere facing troubled times, as the economic crisis of the region worsened,\nleading many to fear they may have to\nquit their courses for financial reasons.\nIn early November LSE held a refer-end um on whether to leave ULU.\nAlthough Felix sources predicted a substantial 'yes' vote, the students gave a resounding 'no' to the idea. At the time\nquestions were being asked as to the\nrole of ULU, and LSE's decision must\nhave been welcome relief.\nNovember will be remembered at\nImperial, however, for more serious rea-sons. The tragic death of an undergraduate from meningitis shocked students\nand staff alike, and led to fears that an\nepidemic similar to those experienced at\nother universities may be on the way. Fortunately the tragedy was not repeated at\nthe college, and if any good came of the\nevent, it was hopefully to remind students to take the threat seriously this\nand every year.\nDecember\nThe second attempt to elect a DP (C&S) saw two candidates stand. Tim Trailor,\nhowever, stepped down in the middle of\nthe campaign, leaving Marie Nicholaou\nopposed only by the omnipresent New\nElection. She went on to win a comfortable victory, although the turnout was\nless than enthusiastic.\nStuart Cook faces the music at St Mary's Friction between Sherfield and ICU\nMarie Nicholaou won her election easily\nCollege again came under fire - this\ntime the Health Centre took the flak.\n\n"

These are not normal cars though.\nImagine a bath-tub being pulled by two\njet engines on long pieces of spaghetti\n- oh and they manage to hover about a metre off the ground. Having the\nengines in front and attached by wet\nspaghetti means that the engines tend to\nget banged about a lot and have a habit\nof snapping off at the slightest hint of a shunt. They also run a little bit fast, 400-600 mph, and that's before turning up\nthe gas and kicking in the afterburners.\nGood Graphics\nTake Wipeout 64, take out\nthe darkness, speed it up\na fraction and place Star\nWars characters in this slippery swi ff moving world.\nThe animation of the craft\nbouncing over the rough\nsurfaces is sublime. View it\nfrom far behind, close\nbehind, from the driver's seat or even looking backwards from the front -though this tends to end\nwith a pile of twisted metal within a few\nseconds\nSeraphim Sounds\nIt is a Lucas Arts star wars games, so lots\nof orchestrated space themes in the\nbackground. Jake floyd( Anakin from the\nfilm) and other characters are sampled\nfor phrases which rapidly become repetitive and tiresome - unless you are drunk,\nthen they become very funny, honest.\nThe other sounds are just as impressive\nand many are taken from the actual film,\nsuch as when the racer glances the surfaces and the edges of the track, producing scraping sounds that are a second\ncousin away from the finger nails dragging down a blackboard classic. A sound\nto absolutely convince you something is\nvery wrong.\nGreat Gameplay\nOver 20 tracks, over three\ndifferent race series, with\nmost tracks having various\nlittle secret short-cuts - well\nnot so much secret as very\ndifficult - this game will\nnot be finished in a day.\nMany tracks also feature\nobstacles which will play\nhell with the engines, and while you can\nrepair on the move, it slows down the\nracer - avoid them. The control method\nis smooth and simple with the analogue\ncontroller, within minutes you will be\nsliding the bathtub, sorry, pod racer Into\ncorners on the easy circuits - on the\nexpert circuits you will still be smashing\ninto the walls with the rest of us mortals.\nSex and Violence\n1> This is Star Wars\n2> This is Lucasarts\n3> The main character is\nonly a young boy.\nNot even a hint of a kiss at the end of a race.\nBest bit\nLosing an engine and\nwatching the tub lose control at 400 mph. The crash\nis spectacular in the least.\nWorst bit\nThe kid's voice shouting \"it's working\"\nwhen repairing; it does start to tire.\nSo who will get it\nRace fans, N64 owners wanting another\ngood game, Star Wars fans. Just try it in\nVirgin and not buy it there and then -1\ndare you.\nCaryS\nR Type Delta (PSX)\nOne line summary\nThe 2D shooter from the arcade is back\nat home.\nWhat's It all about\nBack at the dawn of time a2D shooter\ngame ruled the roost of the arcades. Flying the R9 craft you start with a simple\ngun and beam weapon that charges\nthe longer you hold the button down.\nShoot enough baddies that pop out of\nthe ground, the sea, anywhere a bad die could possibly pop up and you can\nupgrade the weapons on the ship.\nWell it's back in both its original\nform and with a couple of\nfriends (with new and different weapons). All of\nwhich have a force unit,\nan indestructible buddy in\nthe form of a weapon\nloaded ball. The ball can\ndock with the front, the\nback of the ship or be sent\noff to attack the enemy at\nthe corners of the screen.\nA very useful tool - getting the force unit to cover\nyour tail is one task worth learning.\nGood Graphics\nVery colourful... graphics-wise the game\nis not going to be pushing for any prizes.\nThey might be smooth but are not particularly complex. Being a home version\nof an ancient arcade game though does-n't mean that the graphics have not\nbeen skimped on. The 2D nature of the\noriginal have been worked over so that\nthe bad bosses weave in and out of the\nscreen, even if your ship is unable to\ntake advantage of the third dimension.\nSeraphim Sounds\nIt's based upon an old\narcade game shooter.\nOnce again it is not\nexactly going to contest\nfor audio track of the year.\nThe standard bangs and\npops form almost the\nwhole auditory entertain-ment. There is a nice\ntouch when you change your environment and the background tune changes\n-enter the water and it all goes mellow.\nGreat Gameplay\nI was brought up in the 80's where side-on arcade shoot-em-ups ruled the\narcade games. Beat-em-ups were for\nthe weird crowd. The gameplay of R Type\nDelta is not that different from other\nside on shooters - you either love them\nor you hate them. I love this even if it\nstarts to become a case of learning\nwhich waves of enemies come from\nwhich direction.\nSex and Violence\nViolence against aliens doesn't really\ncount... they ask for it every time.\nBest bit\nAbsorbing enemy fire with your force\nunit until you can use the delta weapon.\n.A complete orgy of destruction.\nWorst bit\nThe slowing down of the game when\ntoo many things appear, a price paid\nbecause of the large and colourful ships.\nSo who will get It\nThe Playstation owner who wants to\nrelive the old arcade days, or wants a decent side-on-shooter - it's the best of\nits kind.\nCaryS\n\n"

The view\nthat residents were prepared to bear\nthe majority of the costs was based on\na survey estimating the increase at\n\"tens of pence per week\".\nSome questions have been raised\nas to why such an increase is necessary\nwhen a significant contribution is\nexpected from the IC Trust. The warden\nof Clayponds, Dr MarkTyrer, explained\nthe new building \"will be well received\nby the residents and make a huge\nimprovement to the quality of life at\nClayponds\" but was concerned that \"the\nrate of increase of these estimates\nseems to be surprisingly rapid for what\nis, when all said and done a modest,\none room building and two lavatories.\"\nA number of students have made\nclear their objections, one resident\nwrote an open letter which included\nthe comment: \"with the suggested\n\u00a31.20p per week rent increase, we\ncould hire three of the married couples\nflats, and have a little bit left over for a porch or covered area from the patio\ndoors.\"\nPlans for the developmental are at\nan early stage and so figures have not\nyet been confirmed. Many residents\nhope that the rent will be sub jed to the\nappropriate decrease in five years when\nthe period of rent contribution ends.\nIan Caldwell, Director of Estates was\nnot available to comment.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at MCP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16- 16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Felix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040- 0711\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board.

Each album\nthey have released has been greeted\nwith Immense critical acclaim, and featured highly in many magazines' top\nalbums of the particular year they were\nreleased, but the sales figures have\nnever scaled the same heights.\nHowever, with the release of Terror\nTwilight, the reason for Pavement's under achievement all of a sudden\nseems to be obvious.\nTerror Twilight is Pavement's fifth\nalbum and for the first time they've hired\na producer. Now Pavement had done\nwell enough producing themselves, but\nthe decision to hire Nigel Goodrich, of\nOK Computer fame, is near enough a stroke of genius. With Goodrich's help.\nPavement have produced an album that\nis definitely their best yet, and considering the quality of their previous albums\nthat's quite an achievement. The distinctive sound of Pavement remains and\nthere's still that slight lo-fi edge to the\nsound, but the new production is a rev-ol uti on. Gone is the oddness that Pavement have sometimes tended to drift\nInto, and welcome to some beautifully\nproduced, arranged and performed\ntracks that the best Britpop bands can\nonly aspire to.\nThe first single to be released from\nthe album is the wonderfully titled Carrot Rope. Receiving extensive airtime on\nRadio 1, it's the kind of tune Blur wished\nthey could write. Indeed Terror Twilight\nis the kind of album Blur wished they\ncould write. The album's first track Spit on\na Stranger kicks it off to an incredible start\nand the rest of the album seems to just\nfall perfectly into place. Major League is\nanother highlight, as is the uptempo\nBilly whose sound slides perfectly\nbetween rough and smooth in away that\nonly the sound of Pavement can.\nWith Terror Twilight, Pavement are\nreleasing one of the albums of the year,\nand if you like quality music and beautiful tunes you must have this album.EJ\nJames\nTHE BETA BAND\nThe Beta Band\nThe Beta Band relaxing on a day off from the studio.\nTo call the Beta Band eclectic is\nsomething of an understate-ment; their first three EPs\nChampion Versions, The Patty Patty\nSound and Los Amigos Del Beta\nBandldos demonstrated an awesome\narray of influences, infusing Public\nEnemy, Neil Young and Krautrock with a hint of any other pop style you care to\nmention. This album, their eponymous,\naugments the plan, confirming them to\nbe true visionaries or, it being a fine\nline they tread, confused musical-alchemists.\nOpening track The Beta Band Rap\nsubmerges a personal account of the\nband's story-so-far in a dense auditory\nmosaic of a fairground-carousel tune,\nstoned funk and 50's rock n' roll. Second\ntrack It's Not Too Beautiful is t tul y captivating; opening a la Sugar Spun Sister\nwith a chugging guitar, the song runs\naground twice on Wagnerian strings\nwhilst mellifluous vocals paradoxically\nannounce And I Will Fly, only for the\nsong to be finally sunk by an Also Sprach\nZarathustra coda.\nThe marriage of dub-bass, hip-hop\ndrum-beats, samba rhythms, steel-drums,\nmantras, chants and bedevilled sound-effects emanating from just about anything they could lay their inquisitive\nhands upon, across the remaining eight\ntracks, makes for a bewildering infectious\nstew.\nThe seemingly order less compositions that frame frankly inane lyrics about\nmotorway travel and the band's opinion\non Beach Boys' albums appear to make\nperfect sense. They aren't saying anything new or profound and all the music\nhas been heard before, just not in the\nsame song. And maybe that's the point,\nmaybe the 'Well of Pop-Music' has run\ndry over the last forty years, the only\noption being a chaotic scramble from\none genre to another. Maybe pop-music\nwas always living on borrowed time, its\nbrief being finite, every nuance of the\nhuman condition and facet of human\nemotion having already been chronicled. Is it time to get virtual? Music is\ndead, long live the video game?

Coming to a machine\nnear you is Bloodlines and Ape Escape.\nBloodlines is an attempt to turn a simple game of school tag into a computer game. Set in an arena you and your\nopponent attempt to capture more towers than each other. The first person to\nreach a tower gains the initiative and\nthen rushes to claim the rest of the towers on the level. The opponent can\nattempt to stop you by tagging you (you\nmake it easier to catch someone by slowing the opponent down by shooting\nthem). When tagged, the tables are\nturned and it is your turn to chase and\ntag the opponent while they go for the\ntowers. An original concept and one that\nworks better when playing against people tat her than computers. The 3D graphics are also very impressive and very\ndetailed.\nApe escape is Sony's attempt to produce a cute Mario style game. You play\na character who has to go through time\nsending escaped monkeys back to the\npresent. While the\ngta ph ics are very pretty,\nthe gameplay and control method are excel-lent. Using both the\nanalogue controls, the\ndigital controls and the\nmicro switch in the analogue control it is possible to pull off quick and\nsupple motion on the ground, in the air,\nand in the water.\nWith the correct difficulty level this\nshould keep everyone happy, even the\nmost hardened of Tenchu maniacs.\nGaryS\nCapcom Generations and Star Trek : New worlds (PC)\nVirgin Interactive\nCapcom Generations is not as much a preview as a post view.

So classics like\n1942 and Commandos will be available for all. Now all I need Is a broken joystick to really relive those\ndod gy arcade experiences.\nStar Trek : New Worlds is set\nafter the pesky Romulans mess up\nan experiment and create lots of\nnew planets all ripe for the race that\ncan get there and colonise the\nplanet.\nPlaying the role of either the\nFederation, Klingons or Romulans it\nis your job to build, maintain and\ndefend your base against the other\ntwo races and anything else that is\nout there.

    "content": "14 Interview 23 June 1999\nsir rn nat in x burgh i He runs the College. He's responsible for your\neducation. He ultimately controls a \u00a3250 million\nbudget. But do you know anything about him? Simon\nBaker finds out by interviewing the newly honoured\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, the Rector of Imperial College.\nHow does it feel to be awarded a peerage?\n\"It's been awarded as much for IC's achievements as my own*. Noting no firm political affiliations. Sir Ron promised to sit as a cross-ben cher when he takes up his seat later in the year.\nWhat Is the Rector's Job?\nAsked what he does now, the answer was a simple (and surprising) \"Very little\". In rough terms,\nhowever, \"it's akin to a CEO in any major organ is a tion... all internal and external issues come, at some\npoint, through my office - though much is de le gated\".\nAs a rough example, on any average day Sir Ron\nspends \"at least a third of my time in correspondence and a third in meetings\". More specifically, he\nis responsible for all the College's interactions with\nkey outside bodies - the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principles, the University of London, Parliament, HEFCE (the government authority\nresponsible for funding), the Department of Education & Employment etc etc.\nDo you have any regrets?\nChiefly, \"the lack of a decent Senior Common Room and an academic staff club\".\nCan you clarify the finances of the SCR develop-ment?\nThe total cost is projected at \u00a31.6 million, \"mak-ing this a much larger job than the JCR\". However,\nhe admitted flaws in the business plan for the pro-j ect, noting that \"the SCR need not be self-financing\".\nNonetheless, he accepted that \"it should almost be\nso\" thanks to shop units and expanded trade (recep-t ions in evenings, etc), but ultimately it's \"something\nwe need to do\"\nThe other area of controversy surrounding the\nproject is the contracting out of cate ting. However,\nunable to confirm the future of the outlet one way\nor another, the Rector simply stated that \"no decision has been taken\". Nonetheless, he made it clear\nthat he's not against contracting out in principle, \"but\nit requires resources to be committed to monitor the\ncontract\". In these terms, he believes that the new\nCHP (Combined Heating and Power) Plant programme - currently taking shape beneath the Electrical Engineering building - is an \"ideal project\".\nMoving onto the second regret, he also noted\nthat, come 2001, the site presently occupied by\nHuron University (on the corner of Exhibition Road\nand Princes Gardens) will be taken over by IC, which\nowns the freehold on the property, and that the present intention is to convert the building into an academic club.\nWhat about the controversy surrounding the Portman Travel deal?\n\"I was not involved in that...I don't have the fig-ure s\". So what about the bizzar e, no-rent, commission only arrangement? \"Iam learning this for the\nfirst time... I will ask some questions\"\nHow does the Beit project currently stand?\nConfirming that \"the project will definitely be finished come July 2000\", he set minds at rest with the\nassurance that, whilst all the new rooms will have\nen suite bathrooms, \"rents will not be disproportionately higher\". Ultimately, the College's aim \"is not\nto make money out of students...the cost of the\nbuilding works will be covered by increased conference activity\". His hope is that this will allow\nAccommodation and Estates to \"break the vicious circle ... to form a virtuous circle where increased rent\nfrom improved room stock will feed back into more\nupgrades\".\nSo what impact will the Wye merger have on accommodation? The merger will not lead to a material change\nin the total number of rooms, but the rooms gained\nin Beit will lead to \"small\" losses elsewhere, as other\nhalls are disposed of. In truth, \"Wye will not make\nmuch difference, since there are only 400 students\nthere\", hence \"there should be no net change, ide-ally\".\nElsewhere, the College \"continues to look\ntowards the use of housing associations\", and by\n\"taking our fair share\" of the UL Halls allocation we\nhave gained 100 extra rooms.\nWhat's the current thinking on the RSM refurbish-ment?\nIt's a mammoth task that will cost \"up to \u00a3100\nmillion to do it properly\". Construction work will be\nsplit over three phases, \"beginning in a couple of\nyears\". As yet, however, \"we haven't found the ideal\narchitectural solution\".\nMoving on, do you agree that academic staff are\nunderpaid?\n\"Yes, they are undoubtedly underpaid\".\nSo should we introduce performance-related pay?\n\"In one sense it is irrelevant\". Expanding on that\nsimple statement, Sir Ron explained that, importantly. Imperial is \"probably the only university that\nhas no limits on promotion\" (grade quotas are com-mon). Moreover, he genuinely believes that under\nthe current system, \"more money would probably\nresult in fewer academics\"\nIn reality, he explained that the current problems\nin the pay structure are at the top and bottom - \"Start-ing salaries are not sufficient for those wishing to\nstart a family\", whilst at the other extreme, \"some\nother universities are offering \"silly\" pay packages for\nthose at the top\".\nWhat's your position on Tuition Fees?\nIn the medium term, they're \"an inevitability\".\nInstead, the Rector suggests a system of vouchers,\nsuch that some universities would charge at or\nbelow the voucher value, whereas better institutions\ncould charge more. However, this would require a system of scholarships and low-cost loans running\nin parallel with the scheme\".\nMost importantly, Sir Ron stated that we need\nto preserve \"free education for all who could benefit from it\"\nHow do you feel about IC's climb up the National\nLeague Tables?\nThey're \"a mixed blessing\". In reality, he feels\nthat they're \"not particularly useful\", noting that IC\ncould become number one by simply awarding\nmore 1st and 2:1 degrees. Nevertheless, we \"should-n't look a gift horse in the mouth...and there's no\ncause for complacency\".\ninterview 15\ndose and per s What's your current position on Imperial's membership of the University of London?\nAny suggestion that he is in favour of d is a ff ilia tion is based entirely on a \"mischievous\" article in\nthe Financial Times - and \"there's no prospect of IC\nleaving UL for the foreseeable future\".\nSo what are the benefits of membership?\nIn short, Sir Ron feels that we get a lot out of UL.\nHowever, the principle advantages are probably:\ngreater access to cheap sporting facilities; easier collaboration between College's( which, for example,\nallows us to award joint MSc's); and we can co-or di nate our approach to distance learning - which\nmight not be a big thing for IC at present, but will\nundoubtedly become important in the future, particularly with Wye College so highly regarded in\nAfrica for it's distance learning courses in Agriculture.\nWhich moves us onto the topic of mergers, both past\nand future...\nThe forthcoming Wye merger is \"proceeding\nwell\", with only Royal Ascent required before the bill\ncomes into force (the two institutions are due to\nbecome one in August next year). \"It's certainly a lot\neasier than previous mergers\". Meanwhile, the medical merger is \"meeting expectations\", but there's still\nmuch more to do. All in all it's currently \"satisfactory\".\nCan you explain what's going on with Project 99?\n\"We needed a re-think on how Information\nshould flow around the College\", rather than relying\non \"expensive and only slightly more reliable\"\nreplacements. Hence Project 99 (which is possibly\nnow being re-named ICIS), which intends to be a thorough overhaul and reorganisation of the College's administrative IT provision.\nWith a little over a year to go until you retire, any\nthoughts on your successor?\n\"As far as I'm aware, no one has been appointed\nyet\".\nAnd what does the future hold for you, personally?\n\"I'm not sure -1 don't believe in making long-term plans\". However, he has some commitments\nlined up - and there's always that seat in the House\nof Lords.\nIn conclusion, how would you sum up your time at\nImperial?\n\"It's been very enjoyable\".\nSTAFF REQUIRED\nFOR 99-00\nWE ARE LOOKING FOR NEW\nSTAFF TO WORK IN THE ICU SHOP\nON SHERFIELD WALKWAY\nTHE JOB IS IDEAL FOR POSTGRADS\nNO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY\nCONTACT THE SHOP ON 48473\nOR CALL IN AND ASK FOR DETAILS\n\n"

    "content": "18 News Rewind 23 June 1999\nthe highest form of flattery...\nMarch\nThis was Imperial's month for sport. It\nstarted with the momentous defeat of\nCambourne by RSM, and went on to\ninclude a victory for ICSM rugby in the UH\ncup for a second year. IC's men and\nwomen also won both UL cup and\nleague titles in hockey, football and\nrugby, with the latter also winning the\nGutteridge Cup. Athletics and fencing\nThe Football Team stand victorious\nalso excelled as the competitions con-tin u ed. There was less good news at home,\nhowever, with plans for the new sports\nhall coming under heavy criticism from\nlocal residents and building authorities.\nThe Beit redevelopment was also caught\nup in the debate, but managed to disentangle itself without being rejected.\nThe cause of much of the residents'\nanger was a succession of incidents in\nSouthside in which objects were thrown\nout of hall windows into the mews\nbelow, causing severe damage in one\ncase. This later led to the introduction of\nlocks' on the windows, even though it\nappeared Southside residents were not\nresponsible for the damage.\nAfter a seven year wait, it finally\nlooked like the Village Hall at Clayponds\nwould be built. There was a catch, however - College wanted the cost to be\npassed on as increases in rent, claiming\nthat the Residences Budget could not\nfund the project. Back at South Ken a man was arrested for bike theft, which\nmust have been a blessing for Ken Weir\nand reduced the number of letters written to Felix on the subject.\nThere was yet more student politics\nto be had, with the CCU elections taking\nplace a mere few weeks after ICU'selections. Becky England was comfortably\nelected as ICSM President, while Will\nBently gained the same position in the\nRCSU, although RCSU's below par year\ncontinued with an electoral turnout of\nless than 5%. Dinesh Ganesarajah successfully moved from Guildsheet Editor\nto C& GU President, in a result which surprised many hacks around the college.\nMeanwhile at ULU Matt Butt was\nelected as President for next year, and\nTom Belton hands over the reigns of\nLondon Student to Chris Campbell this\nJuly. Elsewhere in London there were\nsuccesses in the tuition fees campaign,\nwith an occupation by students of administrative buildings forcing Goldsmiths to\nretreat from their threat to expel any students who didn't pay up. They have now\nagreed not to expel students who cannot afford the fees. A similar situation at\nUCL also forced a college climb down, although the lack of support from UCL's Students celebrate their victory\nstudent union caused much controversy\namongst the protesters.\nBack at IC the term ended with both\ngood and bad news. IC applied for an FM\nlicense for May, which was unfortunately\nturned down over Easter. Meanwhile\nnegotiations with London Transport were\nyielding results, with it now looking likely\nthat the discount scheme would be\nextended to mature students. Finally\nChris Ince (DP(F&S)) announced that\nUnion curries would increase in price by\n10p to \u00a31.20, making the old '\u00a31 curry' slogan from last year seem somewhat out\nof date...\nApril\nStudents may go home over the Easter\nholidays, but Imperial keeps going, and\nby the start of the summer term the\nSummer Ball had been confirmed as definitely going ahead. ICU had underwritten the event, taking a gamble that ticket\nsales and sponsorship would avoid a loss in excess of \u00a320,000 - a gamble that\nin retrospect may look foolhardy.\nICSM's football team had the First\nDivision Championship taken away from\nthem, after entering a doctor no longer\non a course in their team. An appeal\nbrought them no joy, and they finished\nthe season third. Back on the South Ken\ncampus a fire over the holidays narrowly\navoided damaging Biochemistry's base-ment, while Joint Maths and Computing\nstudents gained Chartered Engineer status upon graduating.\nindeed be sold to finance the new sports\nhall, although both College and ICU\nauthorities denied that any decision had\nbeen made. The sports centre proposals\nthemselves came under heavy fire from\nlocal residents, putting the entire project\nin jeopardy.\nThere were problems in halls as well.\nSouthside residents came back from the\nholidays to find that the windows overlooking the mews had been barred,\nprompting a string of complaints as students attempted to study in stifling con-ditions. A leaked college document\nshowed that Imperial was going to be\nsomewhat short of hall rooms in a few\nyears time, particularly when some Wye\nstudents are living at Imperial.\nImperial itself increased its rankings\nin the Times league tables to number\ntwo, demoting Oxford to third place. The\nAUT confirmed and went ahead with its\nThe AUT strike made its point. Just.\nstrike, although the disruption to exams\nand services was minimal.\nICSM announced details of its summer ball, which is to take place the day\nbefore ICU's. Questions were asked concerning why the college refused to help\nfund the ball, the response being the\nstandard 'our money is for educational\npurposes only'. There was better news for\nICU in May, however, as fond on Transport confirmed it was to include mature\nstudents in its discount scheme from\nnext September. ICU's Annual General\nMeeting rounded off the month, and\nwas quick and efficient, with none of the\nfarcical events associated with last year's. June\nMay\nFelix came under fire from all\nquarters this month. An article\nabout the private housing\noffice, claiming that they had\nengaged in what amounted\nto a vetting service, was\nsharply denied by Catherine\nJohn, the lady in charge of\nsuch matters.\nMore evidence came to\nlight that Teddington will\nAnd so we arrive at the last few weeks\nof the year - a time for tying up loose\nends. Clayponds was finally given the\ngo ahead to be built next year, although\nquestions still remain as to whether it is\nright to expect students to foot the bill.\nStaying with halls, Southside residents\nmet with Pro-Rector Tim Clark and per-NEED SPACE? sua ded him to re-evaluate the\nworth in barring students'win-dow s. Students stand to lose\nout elsewhere in Southside,\nhowever, as it was revealed\nthat College plan to take over\nSouthside gym while the\nsports centre is expanded,\nstarting in twelve months\ntime. Worse still, they plan to\nkeep it once the work is fin-is he d. The fallout from the AUT strike\nincluded a small debate as to the role of\nstudents in such disputes, while college\nrefused to give the strikers' pay to student\nhardship funds. Further action is planned\nto disrupt admissions procedures this\nAugust. On the subject of financial dis-put es, the College are planning to expel\nforty students who have yet to pay all\ntheir tuition fees if the money isn't received by the end of September.\nAlthough it seems likely that many of\nthem will pay, ICU will hopefully offer its\nsupport to those who can't, and follow\nthe precedents set by Goldsmiths and\nUCL if the college refuses to listen.\nMore economic question marks\nhave been raised around Sherfield, with\nmore information now available on the\nreplacement of STA Travel by Portmans.\nOnce again facts are hard to come by,\nsuffice to say that there is something very\nsuspicious, if not downright corrupt,\nabout the deal. Plans to refurbish the SCR\nhave been unveiled, with the projected\ncost running much higher than most\npeople expected.\nICU also seems likely to suffer financial set-backs, with poor ticket sales causing problems for the Summer Ball. As it\nstands the Union could lose upward of\n\u00a320,000.\nLastly, Imperial's Rector Sir Ron\nOxburgh was made a peer in the\nQueen's birthday honours list. Although\nhe admits to doing very little these days,\nFelix would like to congratulate him on\nan undoubtedly deserved reward, and\nwould urge him to use his remaining\ntime as Rector here to help the students\nwho, at the end of the day, should be at\nthe core of every university.\nThe 1998-1999 sabbatical team.

What age gap.\nn her first screen appearance since\nher feisty, swashbuckling role in The\nMask of Zorro, Catherine Zeta-Jones\ndiscards the corset and dons a power-suit, playing Virginia 'Gin' Baker, an\ninsurance investigator. Following the\ntheft of a priceless Rembrandt (valued\nat $24 million), she tracks down the\nprime suspect in the form of legendary\nart thief, Robert 'Mac' MacDougal (the\nobsession with trendy nicknames was\nirritating to put it mildly). In order to\nexpose his crimes, Zeta-Jones goes\nundercover posing as a fellow felon.\nThe bait is an ancient mask protected\nby a supposedly infallible security s ys tem, in the spirit of the un sinkable Titanic. The artefact is shielded by a lush jungle of laser beams...\nImpenetrable to mere mortals, but not\nto our blindfolded, cat suit clad heroine.\nThis cunning obstacle is a blatant\nexcuse to have her perform several\nmoments of slow-motion pseudo-erotic\ngymnastics in a skimpy, slinky outfit.\nMale viewers will not complain. Nor will\nfemale audiences. Even though Sean\nConnery sports a beard, a receding hairline and more wrinkles than an un ironed shirt, he still remains the object of many\nfather-figure fantasies. In fact, Connery\nhas become more distinguished with\nmaturity. The age gap between the\nleads might appear unrealistic and\nunsettling - well, he is old enough to be\nher grandfather - but the sizzling on\nscreen chemistry is undeniable. The sexual tension is handled with more class\nand subtlety than your average Hollywood blockbuster (more From Here to\nEternity than Basic Instinct), as the couple engages in an 'electric pas de deux\nof wariness and attraction'.\nThis film obviously managed to\nspend even/ penny of its travel kitty.\nThe exotic locations include the New\nYork skyline, the Scottish Highlands and\nthe wonder o us grey cityscape of London. The Petronas Towers in downtown\nKuala Lumpur also form the backdrop to\none of the best heart-in-the-throat action\nsequences since Mission: Impossible's Channel Tunnel scene. Several hundred\nfeet up and dangling precariously from\na string of light bulbs, Connery and ZetaJones are guaranteed to induce vertigo\nin even the most height-hardened of\nclimbers.\nMillennium mania has even infected\nthis film, with a high-tech heist set on\nmidnight of New Year's Eve 2000 - very\ntopical, indeed. The casting of Sean\nConnery as a Scot was an inspired stroke\nof genius, considering his immutable\ntrademark accent. Sadly, however, ZetaJones' american is ed twang is cringe-worthy, in the league of Dick Van Dyke's cockney impersonation in Mary Poppins.\nDodgy accents aside. Entrapment is\na thoroughly enjoyable thriller, riddled\nwith twists and turns - a veritable cat and\nmouse game of trust and deception.il\nHelena & Gary\nAnalyse This * * * *\nStarring : Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow\nDirector: Harold Ramis\nBilly Crystal seems to have stolen Joe Pescl's rightful place. Brave man.\nRobert De Niro's status as a screen\nIcon is long since assured - there\nmust be countless student\nhouseholds adorned with the ironically grinning image of Travis Bickle\nenquiring if we are, rather unwisely,\nlooking at him. However, it seems that\nthe fire in the belly of the youthful De\nNiro responsible for his intense screen\npresence has dwindled to barely a smoulder, as he seems content to\nphone in performances in pretty undemanding roles and scar per with a fat\ncheque. Why else did he bother with\nWag the Dog or Ronlnl Bobby fans will\nrejoice, then, when Analyze This reaches our screens in late August, featuring\nthe man in top form if in a slightly\nunexpected role.\nThough his best known performances should be filed under painstaking method realism, he has occasionally\nstrayed into the realm of comedy,\nnotably with the hilarious Midnight Run.\nHis latest film finds him aiming for\nlaughs once again, though trading heavily on his image as everyone's favourite\nmafia hard man. He plays Paul Vitti,\nhead of a New York crime family and a man used to inspiring fear in his friends\nand enemies alike. Not really a nervous\nintrospective can didi ate for psycho-analysis, but when the pressure of out-mano eve ring his rival mobsters begins\nto cause anxiety attacks, he is forced to\nseek the help of a psychiatrist. The reluctant shrink, Dr Ben Sobel (played by an\nin form Billy Crystal) rapidly has to get\nused to his new patient's habit of turning up with a bodyguard and a gun\nrather than an appointment, and very\nsoon his private life is affected. His\nfiancee (Lisa Kudrow with a per f oman ce which could probably have been cobbled together from a selection of\nFriends eps i odes) certainly isn't too keen\non Ben consorting with members of\nthe criminal underworld.\nThe on screen pairing of De Niro\nand Crystal is a huge success, both\nexpertly handling the one liners along\nwith the development of their unusual\ndoctor/patient relationship. Though the\nplot looks a little flimsy at times, the\njokes are the sort which make you laugh\nout loud, and isn't that the most effective form of therapy? Q Simon\n\n"

We headed for\nthe Oshkosh Fly-in held in Wisconsin. The flight was long\nand covered lots of nice countryside.\nOshkosh is where the headquarters of the Experimental Aviation Association is located. This is also where\nthe world's largest airshow and fly inis hosted. When I say\nfly-in, that is over 70,000 aircraft flying into the airport in\nthe space of a few days. This is not an easy task- it requires\nthe USA's finest air traffic controllers to deal with the densest airspace in the world. Indeed, it is considered the highest honour for an air traffic controller to work at Oshkosh\nfor the week. Watching them in action is excitement in\nitself - landing planes at the rate often a minute - often\n3 abreast, in formation. Normal radio procedures are not\nfollowed: the controllers give the commands on the radio\nand the pilots have to acknowledge they have received\nthem by waggling their wings.\nOshkosh attracts all types of aircraft from all over the\nworld. They are extremely friendly towards international\nvisitors, and even throw a party for us with free hot dogs\nand beer.\nThe airshow is incredible. Once you have been here,\nand seen these world-class aerobatics displays, you might\nbe disappointed by any other airshow. Both the United\nStates Air Force and world-class acrobatic pilots put on the\nmost incredible air display. There is something for every-one. Organisation on the ground is equally as efficient as\nit is in the sky. Aircraft are grouped on the ground by type\n- the old war plane flight line is a must-see, with easily\nenough aircraft for an air invasion of an Eastern European\nState.\nAs well as the manufacturers of General Aviation air-craft, there are such diverse trade stands as the Bahamas\ntourist board, who lend out wetsuits and employ Bahamian\nbabes to give a free half-hour diving lesson In a swimming\npool. Just what I needed on a hot day.\nChicago\nThose familiar with Microsoft Flight Simulator might recognise the airport we flew into. Migs Field, located adjacent\nto Downtown Chicago, is the default airport on flight sim,\nand as such, I had flown in hundreds of times in the virtual world. On landing, we noticed several discreet black\nminivans drive past our plane and then move on. Apparently Bill and Hilary were in town that weekend for the\nDemocrat conference and they were merely checking us\nout.\nAs if Oshkosh wasn't enough of an airshow for us,\nwe were given the pleasure of a display by the 'Blue\nAngels' over the harbour. This is the US Nav/s variant of\nthe Red Arrows, only much better, with more daring\nstunts.\nOur first few hours in Chicago were spent walking\nfrom the airport and getting orientated. We stumbled upon\nthe Art Institute, apparently one of the world's premier art\ngalleries. This contains a magnificent collection of art\ntreasures, providing reason enough to visit Chicago.\nYou shouldn't go to Chicago without experiencing the\near-popping lift to the viewing deck of the Sears Tower.\nFrom there, you can see the cityscape and appreciate the\nastonishing architecture of the surrounding buildings.\nAnother place we visited that is well worth a trip is the\nChicago Board of Trade. Here you can witness the fracas\nof one of the World's busiest futures and options dealing\nfloors.\nOnce again we avoided expensive hotels by staying\nwith friends. They also took us for an eventful ride on Lake\nMichigan in their speedboat. Like a bad Baywatch plot, this\nresulted in us helping in a search and rescue for a drowned lady. To cut a long story short, the coastguard\nhelicopter was called out and she was eventually located\n10 ft under water by another boat's 'fish-finder'. Seeing\nthe frogmen go in and winch her out of the water put a lump in my throat that lasted to the evening.\nJust before leaving, we toured the Shedd Aquarium,\nnext to Migs Field. A massive assortment of finned, gilled,\namphibious and other aquatic creatures swim here, as well\nas Beluga whales, white-sided dolphins, seals, sea otters\nand penguins.\nToronto\nWe flew into Toronto City airport, a mere two-minute taxi-ride to downtown.\nWe got a great deal in a4 star hotel just overlooking\nthe CN Tower and harbour. There are so many hotel rooms\nin this city that during slack times they reduce the rates\nto a fraction of the normal cost just to boost occupancy.\nIt turned out cheaper to stay here than to stay in the youth\nhostel.\nA trip to see the spectacular view from the CN tower\nis well worth it. The lift to the top is free if you book a table\nat the rotating restaurant. Surprisingly they didn't have arm-and-a leg prices and it turned out that the main dish we\nhad was priced at only a pound more than the ride up the\nlift to the viewing gallery. The food was absolutely excellent though the service was somewhat rushed by a team\nof Chinese waiters, eager to squeeze another sitting\nbetween the first and the second. We took our time eat-ing.\nOttawa\nNational capitals are renowned for being the least interesting places to visit in any country, though recent developments to address this has made Ottawa an exception.\nWe stayed at the youth hostel near to the city centre.\nLocated in an old jail house, we enjoyed the novelty of\nsleeping in former prisoners' cells. If you really want to,\nyou can even view the gallows where the last public hanging in Canada took place. Despite its history it was quite\na cheery hostel. Close to Ottawa's lovely and lively down-town, there are so many restaurants and bars in a nearby\nmarket that will make your head spin.\nThe city's beauty stands out in both it' architecture,\nlandscaping, parks and monuments. The parliament buildings gentrify the city and the public transport system is as\nmuch an asset as the beaver tails served in a market kiosk.\nWe ate the 'Blue Plate Special' breakfast at Zaks\nDiner. This filled us up for, mmm, about two days. The ZZ-Top hairstyle d waiter wasn't lying when he said it was\nbig. After that fill up, we caught the bus back to Ottawa\nInternational airport and needed the full length of the runway to take off.\nMontreal\nAlthough there is quite a large Anglophobic community\nin Quebec, Montreal is extremely cosmopolitan and\nalmost everyone speaks English. Funky bars and clubs line\nthe streets. Montreal rocks.\nThe Quebecois are proud of their French heritage. This\nis manifested through their driving (like maniacs). If you\nare a pedestrian in this city, be aware that the 'WALK' signal on pedestrian crossings means nothing. Just remember to look both ways before crossing the road.\nHungry? Montreal is excellent for eating out and is full\nof restaurants. One of the culinary specialities of Quebec\nare Poutines (pronounced 'poo-teens'). These are french\nfries topped with gravy and cheese curds. To the uninitiated, this might sound disgusting. To my doctor, it might\nsound like instant cardiac arrest. However, after a night on\nthe town, they are absolutely delicious and I thoroughly\nrecommend eating them no more often than once in your\n23 june 1999 Travel 2 1\nAIRLINE\nTOUR OF THE USA AND IT'S TIME TO GET TOURISTY\nlifetime.\nWe took a guided tour of the Olympic Complex, built\nfor the 1976 games. Apparently the city is still paying back\nthe three billion dollars (in 1976 money) it cost to build. It\nnever ceases to amaze me how much is paid for masses\nof ugly grey concrete.\nQuebec City\nAgain we spotted the French temperament en route to\nQuebec City. Protesting pig farmers decided to bring\ntheir livestock out for a day trip and as a result blocked the\nmotorway between Montreal and Quebec City.\nLooking totally out of place in North America, Quebec City is an old walled city: You can actually sit on top\nof the old ramparts to eat and look out on the gorgeous\nSt Laurence River. A car is definitely not required.\nThe city is so neat and tidy, I felt I was in Disneyland.\nNevertheless, there is nothing Mickey Mouse about this\ntown, and it's worth a visit simply for its quaint beauty and\nattempts at french cuisine.\nBoston\nTo avoid Boston International airport's expensive landing\nfees, we flew into a small local airfield (Norwood) and\nrented a car to get us into town.\nBoston was an expensive overnight stay. We arrived\nat the time when terms for US colleges start simultaneously - and as such had to pay top-dollar for what was perhaps the last available room in town. To compound this,\nwe were also awarded a parking ticket for being on a metered space after 6pm, when, according to the small\nsign (pointing the opposite direction, 100m away), metered\nspaces turn into residents parking only. Still, the ticket cost\nless that it would have done in the hotel's car park.\nIf you are a masochist, then driving in Boston will be\na high point in your life. The car was a bit of a mistake -1\nrecommend using the T Boston's answer to the tube.\nBoston is a walker's town. We followed the two and\na half mile Freedom Trail, which links over a dozen historic\nsites. Some of the historic buildings are so well preserved\nand neat, you could be forgiven for thinking you were\nwalking in Disneyland. Conversely, the town's atmosphere was extremely dusty. Aptly named the 'Big Dig', the\ncity is presently investing about $1 billion per mile in routing its freeways underground.\nIf you need to shop, Boston is a great place to go. Wth\na sales tax (VAT) of only 5% and a good selection of stores,\nsome terrific value can be found. The aircraft was somewhat heavier when we took off for New York.\nNew York\nNot all the good air traffic controllers were in Oshkosh. I managed to get clearance to fly the Hudson River Corridor, directly past the Statue of Liberty and the skyscrapers\nof Manhattan. It will take an awful lot to top that experience. We landed in Teterboro airport, just north of town and\ncaught a bus to Manhattan island. Hotels in New York can\nbe a bit pricey, so we were fortunate to use a friend's apartment just a couple of blocks from the Empire State.\nWherever we went, we felt like we had been there\nbefore. Of course, we had to make the trip to all the iconic\nplaces: the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square and Wall Street. Cllimbing the 354\nsteps to the Statue's crown is over-rated, and I suggest\nspending the time going to the Staten Island Museum of\nImmigration instead. Most of Manhattan is extremely\neasy to navigate, thanks to a grid system of named or numbered avenues running the north-south length of the\nisland, cut across by numbered streets that run from east\nto west. The atmosphere was not far removed from that\nof London, so I felt at home immediately. Overall, we\nfound our stay in NY to be an in-your-face, exhilarating\nexperience.\nWashington DC\nWe landed at College Park, a historic airport close to the\ncity, in which the Wright Brothers used to be based. From\nhere you need only cross the road to a Metrorail station,\nmaking the transport into town pretty much a 'no-b rainer'. Again, we stayed with friends, this time from Georgetown University. We also got the timing right: during\nfresher s week. We managed to hit about three parties in\njust one night. For those interested, being a mainly arty\ncollege, Georgetown has an inverse male/female ratio to\nIC. The students there also seemed to be extremely\nwealthy (you need to be to afford the fees), with about\nhalf the females I met having their own personal sports\ntrainer.\nDC has some incredible museums and most are\nfree. The Mall is home to some of the capital's most\nfamous museums, in particular the Smithsonian Institution.\nOf course, we had to visit the Smithsonian's National Air\n& Space Museum. This is packed full with historic air and\nspacecraft, including the Wright brothers' plane and the\nApollo IX command module. We also visited the US Holocaust Museum, which isn't part of the Smithsonian, but\nis one of the city's best museums. It's a haunting memorial to victims of Nazi tyranny, covering the period 1933\nto 1945.\nWe wanted to take the tour around the FBI building\nbut they wouldn't let us in. Maybe it had something to do\nwith being closed on Saturday.\nBe warned: Washington's tree-lined avenues and\ngrand buildings create a surprisingly warm, almost cozy\natmosphere - though Washington is notorious for poverty,\ncrime and racial segregation in the shadow of glorious\nmonuments proclaiming \"equality for all\". As a result, DC\ncan be quite a dangerous place, and tourists are often tar-get ed. Hiitonhead Island, South Carolina\nNever before have I seen such a beautiful, deserted\nbeach. Apart from the many golf courses and executive\nhomes, Hiitonhead Island is an uns polit paradise. Wildlife\nis prevalent. Throw a rock and you might hit a pelican. However, finding somewhere to eat is quite difficult. So long\nas you don't mind eating pelicans, you're fine here.\nSavannah, Georgia\nDon't tell me about living life on the edge. The nice\nweather at Hiitonhead was the calm before the eye of the\nstorm. A hurricane that was supposed to hit the Bahamas\nchanged tack - and the eye of the storm was now heading for us in Savannah. What we briefly saw of this historic\nsouthern town was very pleasant - shopkeepers boarding\nup their windows, and families leaving their trailed parks\nwith wide-screen TV's strapped to roof-racks was our cue\nto get out. We checked the weather carefully and then\ntook advantage of a high altitude tail wind to push us\nhome.\nBack to Meacham Field, Fort Worth\nAs we taxied to the ramp at Meacham Field, we were sad\nto finish the journey. So much ground covered in so little\ntime. Still, there's plenty of time left. Hopefully our future\nBahamian Island-hopping plans won't be wrecked by\nhurricanes.\n\n"

    "content": "40 Music 23 June 1999\nAlbums\nKRISTIN HERSH\nSky Motel\nIEFNER\nThe Fidelity Wars\nSmile!\nFollowing last years disappointing\nMurder, Mystery and then\nGoodnight, Sky Motel represents\nsomething of a return to form for Kristin\nHersh, melding the vibrant and dizzying electricity of Throwing Muses with\nthe mellower, yet equally intense,\nacoustic sound of her subsequent solo\nwork.\nEcho, the first single from the album,\nbounces fluidly from organ to guitar,\nstops, restarts and all the while enfolds\nyou in its delicious melody. Hersh's voice, idiosyncratic as ever, ensnares\nwhilst betraying her troubled battles with\nbipolar depression; 'I'm loving every-body, and hating everyone I see...I'm scaring everybody, I'm wearing everybody down'.\nThe common theme that transpires\nacross the twelve tracks is the loss of love\nand a desire for its rediscovery; 'All I want is you, smiling/faithful to the finish,\nI'm grateful to be in this with you/A fucker of a lifeline/ A mother of a lifetime\nwith you'; 'Made you not believe/ Made\nyou lose your faith in the afterlife/ And\nall that breathes'.\nThe English language being what it\nis, the second person you being descriptively interchangeable with the first person I, it's difficult to decipher self-refer-en ce from comments on others. Kristin's out-pouring s of love and vitriolic spite\nmay be aimed at others, quite probably\naimed at herself.\nThe more robust sound could be\nattributed to th'e return to the fold of\nDavid Narcizo, the percussionist and\ndrummer from Throwing Muses, or just\nHersh's desire to revisit the former glories of the late '80s. Nostalgia was a particularly prevalent theme on her last\nalbum, it being a collection of\nAppalachian folk songs from her child-hood. The Ghost of Times Past can be\nfelt here too, this album presents Hersh\nas the person we all know, cathartic to\nthe bitter end, searching for red emp tion, searching for justification. H Chris\nBILLIE MAHONIE\nThe Big Dig\nThe band take a momentary break as\nthey look for a spare plectrum\nT his is a purely instrumental album, with the instruments being mainly of the guitar flavour. Oh how\nmisleading the first few tracks are. The opening track.\nWatching People Speaking When You Can't Hear What\nThey're Saying, is good (although not as impressive as its\ntitle), but the second is called Glenda and is blindingly attractive. The guitars are strummed so delicately and is put\ntogether naturally with the drums. The tempo varies constantly throughout the track but never throws the piece off,\nresulting in a blissful yet energetic sound. With the calm and\nmellow ending to the third track, although it is a very interesting number, we begin to witness the fairly rapid decline\ninto the land of repetition.\nThe remainder of the album does have its subtle differences among the tracks but these are not enough to characterise each one as individual; they all seem to start off in a not too impressive similar manner and that pattern is essentially present till the end of each track.\nThe final track comes as a bit of a surprise though, and\nIts policy is more along the lines of the opening tracks. But\nit's too little too late I think. I'm not really sure what this album\nis trying to achieve; some parts of It sound a bit like dream-music but that doesn't hold for very long and quickly breaks\ndown into a dull blunder. There is nothing groundbreaking or\nclever about this album. I 've listened to the album a few times\nover (mainly because the nine tracks total just a tad over forty\nminutes) and I don't think I 'll ever do it again.

Tracks\nin included on the album include the massive 'Silence' and 'Enchanted'. You get two CDs for your money, the second including dance remixes and other rare material. Out now. East West\nConnection\nEast West Connection\nThe More I Get '\n(Chilli Funk) 1\nBy taking the combination of two of London' s bets loved under-ground DJs, and the musical mastery of ex-Brand New Heavy Neil\nCowley, this album fuses together the 'in' influences of jazz, funk\nand soul. Sadly, the album is let down by the lack of variation and as you're listening to it, you get the feeling that no effort has been made to define each song they all sound the same. The vocals\nare alright, but there are plenty of other albums out there that use\nthe same genres but to much better effect. This actually sounds like a Brand New Heavy album there's a surprise! Out now. React Presents... React Presents....\n'Sharp Vs Sharp'\n(React)\n4\nThe Sharp Boys are resident DJs at the legendary Heaven in Lond on every Saturday (though whether Heaven remains is now open to debate), where they spin their unique blend of US house and ga ta ge to maximum effect on the hallowed one and two's. With\nthis double CD release the album brings the ve ty best party\nsounds of the summer, using tracks from their own label such as\nSara Parker's' My Love Is Deep' and also tracks which the Sharp\nboys have remixed such as Cevin Fisher's The Freaks Come Out1\n.\nMixing US house and garage together, the album takes you through a musical journey and is essential summer listening.\n\n"

The Second Line\nhas a deconstructed sound that is a blend of the Pixies surf-rock with Arab\nStrap's mumbling, musing vocal style.\nThe B sides are very different though,\nmuch more rocky and well driven,\nalthough I have serious doubts that the\nlead singer is in fact singing in English!\nMeOne-EP.\nProduced by the Roots this E.P. is funky\nand fresh, a smooth and groovy sound\nfor the summer. Me-One's rappers\nsound like a fusion between Bob Marley\nand a slightly more talented Wyclef\n(Fugees). The E.P.'s production shies\naway from the hard beats of much of the\nhip-hop around at the moment and\ncomes with a mellow jazzy flavour. Pretty\ngood.\nFridge - OfEP\nNow I quite like Fridge, I 've reviewed two\nof their albums in the past but this sin-g le, confusingly named the Of EP is a and is infused with all sort of clicks and\ntwitters, as well as some funky vocal\nsamples.\nGomez Bring It On\nWell you've probably heard and seen\nthis single all over the place already. It's a strong retro inspired funky indie track.\nThe balance between the gui tats and\ndrums complement the rough vocal style\nof the lead s in get and it is not a bad little track at all.\nRosko-GetOut\nWell, a new indie three piece - what a novelty! These three lads look frightenIngly like several Imperial College students I know, but let's not hold that\nagainst them. The first track Get Out is\nreally quite good, and has the sound of\nmany of the seminal early nineties indie\nbands. The B sides live up to their pos i tion, being somewhat less inspired than\nthe title track. EI\nRamzl\ning this. Entertaining, inventive and innovative with B sides that drip with oodles\nmore talent than the average white\nband. A poor man's Gomez.\nFreestylers featuring Definition of Sound\nHere We Go\n'Here we go on a ride with the new\nFreestylers,' rings the chorus in between\nthe rap verses that can't help but put a smile on your face. Feel-good music for\na happy summer. Go on, let your hair\ndown and dance like a care-free idiot.\nRemixes to rock out to, as well. Nice\none, lads.\nLiz Horsman - Just Thinking\nLabelmates with Blur, Liz Horsman does\na decent job of mixing grunge-y guitars\nwith some traditional female angst. Just\npoppy enough to grab the young\nslight departure from their highly minimal\nmusical style. Version, the first track on\nthe single, is driven by a big bass beat\nteenager market. Just enough rock to\nplease the indie crowd. However, it could\nbe just a bit too much of the glossy production to really have any deep impact\non you. Sonic meat and potatoes.\nEverlast - finds\nVery good stuff. His album, WhiteyFord\nSings the Blues, is crammed with tales of\nurban woe. This single is no exception\nwith some inspired rhymes and poignant\nthemes. 'If you're broke, she spit. If you're\nrich, she might swallow,' is the type of\nthing that makes it through to the radio\nedit. If you've liked his first two singles,\nI strongly recommend you give his album\na listen.\nSnow Patrol - Starflghter Pilot\nRetro-space-rock is probably some sort of\noxymoron or something but retro-space-rock is perhaps the only way of des crib Jennlfer Lopez - If You Had My Love\nYou know Jennifer Lopez, right.

So what's the deal\nwith this R&B samba single? Well, it's not\na one-off, as there's an album on the way\nas well. It's also not a complete load of\ntoss either, as far as R&B tracks go.

    "content": "23 June 1999 News 3\nStudents Face Expulsion Over Fees\nBy Andrew Ofori\nStudent activism has undergone something of a renaissance during the\nopposition to Labour's tuition fees.\nWhile IC looked on, many universities\nhave led extensive campaigns in the\npublic eye and although a Governmental reform has as yet alluded them,\nthey have won numerous concessions\nas well as supporters. The harsh reality of the fees is about to bring the university careers of some IC students to\nan end.\nThe college is currently awaiting\npayments from around forty students\nwith five still yet to pay the first install-ment. The college has sent corre-sponde n ce throughout the year\nreminding them of the payment and\noffering help and advice if needed.\nSome of those involved took the\nopportunity to explain their position,\nbut as yet none of the five who failed\nto make the first installment have\nresponded. The college has informed\nall those who have not paid that if the\nmoney has not been received by the\nend of term they will not be able to\nreturn next year.\nThe college has had a long standing policy of expulsion for non payment of fees and it has been applied\nconsistently over the years; last year a number of overseas students owing\nfees at the end of the academic year\nhad to leave the college.\nTony Cullen of the registry office\nqualified the measures: \"In the interest\nof fairness and equality we have to\napply the rules across the board.\"\nOverall registry was \"pleased with the\nway students have responded\" and he\nfelt the widespread compliance was\ndue in part to explanations of the col-leg e's position sent out to new\nentrants last summer. Maintaining\n\"registry has been as sensitive as pos-sib le\", Mr Cullen made it clear that\nthose threatened with expulsion were\ngiven ample opportunity and still have\nuntil September to find the money.\nThere have been no students in\nthe college who have refused to pay\non principle and there are still options\nopen to those in financial difficulty, but\nthe college has been placed in an awkward position with students not replying to letters.\nICU President Dave Hellard\nexplained many institutions had made\ntheir campaigns against fees political,\nbut he viewed the issue as one of\npracticality stating \"If students couldn't pay it would be unfair for the college\nto throw them out.\" He went on \"We\ncould have helped and possibly might\nbe able to help a limited few,\" referring\nto sources such as the Access and\nHardship funds. Disappointed with\nthe fact those involved had not come\nto the Union for help, Mr Hellard concluded \"They've been told the consequences and done nothing. Maybe\nthey've just resigned themselves to\nthe fact they're leaving\".\nNext year all undergraduates paying fees will face a bill of \u00a31025; the\nICU President did not see the increase\nfrom \u00a31000 as an additional problem\ncommenting \"It's going to have to\nincrease at some point.\"\nSouthsiders Sir Ron Receives\nCaged-in Peerage\nBy Abigail Lazzerlne\nOn Wednesday 9 June, the college\nresearched further into the Southside\nwindows dispute. Two south-facing\nSouthside residents had a prototype\ngrill installed, attached to the inside of\ntheir window; one filling half and the\nsecond filling the whole of one sliding\nwindow.\nThe grills are made of steel, and\nhave a square mesh of 5 cm by 5 cm to\nenable more aeration than is currently\noffered by the blocks, which allow only\na four-Inch gap for ventilation.\nThe rooms were visited by the ProRector Professor Tim Clark, Mr Tony\nMitcheson, Secretary of the College, Dr\nJohn Hassard (Tizard and Selkirk war-den) and Ms Brown and Mr Vincent\nfrom the Accommodation office, all of\nwhom were concerned for a swift conclusion to the situation and looking forward to installing a more acceptable\nobstruction and Mews-friendly solution.\nSome residents have seen the new\ngrill, and although they agree that the\ngrills are a better option than the blocks,\nthey have suggested the grills make\nthe rooms like \"cages.\" There is concern\nfor how new students will adapt to moving into this environment with the intimidation of the grills.\nThe new measures come have\ncome as a result of incidents earlier\nthis year when objects were thrown\nthrough the window (Felix 1143). One\nof the most costly elements of these\nactions was the damage caused to the\ncollege's relations with local residents;\nespecially when taking into account\nthey have already objected to some of\nthe college's building proposals for the\narea.\nOn Tuesday 15 June, visitors from\nWestminster City Council surveyed the\nrooms, from inside and outside, to\nassess if the new Installations will contradict the building's listed status. It is\nmost likely that if this is cleared, the grills\nwill be in place in one hundred and\ntwenty rooms for the start of next term,\nalthough this was not entirely clear at\nthe time of going to press.\nThe full cost to the College is estimated to be around \u00a313,000 but by\nmaking the investment, the College\nhopes to appease local residents and\nmake future planning applications easier. It should be reported, however,\nthat the installation is for approximately\none year until the whole building is\nrefurbished and the window problem\ncan be wholly rectified.\nBy Sunil Rao\nOn Saturday 12 June, it was announced\nthat Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of Imperial College, is to be made a life peer\n(Baron) as part of the Queen's Birthday\nHonours list. Sir Ron, who was knighted\nin 1992, has been Rector here since 1993,\nand is one of six new life peers created\nthis year. Also commended is Professor\nDavid Phillips, Head of the Department of\nChemistry since 1992, who has been\nmade an OBE for his services to science\neducation.\nThe British honour system is based on\nmerit, and honours are awarded for\nexceptional achievement or service. Any\nBritish national can be recommended for\nan honour - recommendations are made\nto the Prime Minister's Office either by\ngovernment ministers or by members of\nthe general public. The recipients of the\nawards are then 'chosen' by the Queen\non the 'advice' of the Prime Minister.\nSir Ron was educated at Oxford and\nPrinceton, and subsequently taught at\nOxford and then at Cambridge, where he\nheaded the Earth Sciences Department\nfrom 1980 to 1988. He was also appointed\nto the National Committee of Inquiry into\nHigher Education, better known as the\nDearing Committee, in May 1996, and will\napparently sit in the House of Lords as a cross-ben cher. Professor Phillips was educated at Birmingham and worked in\nTexas, in Moscow and at Southampton\nbefore becoming Professor of Physical\nChemistry here at Imperial in 1988. He is\nwell-known for his efforts to promote science in general and chemistry in particular, and his lectures to schoolchildren\nand on television.\n\n"

Add the director of The English Patient and stir\nin some beautiful Italian scenery. What\ndo you have? A surefire winner, that's what.\nBased on a Patricia Highsmith novel\n(which was also the inspiration for the\n1960 French classic Plein Solell), The Talented Mr Ripley sees Damon extending\nhis range as a sociopath sent to turn-of-the-century Italy to entice a wealthy\nyoung playboy (Jude Law, last seen in\neXist enZ) to return to his family in the\nUS. However, his desire to be like the\nman he's sent to 'rescue' leads to mur-der. Damon then assumes the identity\nof his dead friend, and attempts to live\nhis life and win over Paltrow.\nDespite the amazing cast (which\nalso includes Oscar nominee Cate\nBlanchett and This Life's Jack Davenport)\nand multi-award winning director, it's worth noting that adaptations of good\nfrench movies have a tendency to\nRELEASE DATE : October 22\nSTARS : Samuel L Jackson, Saffron\nBurrows, LL Cool J DIRECTOR: Renny Harlin\nD on't be fooled by anyone who tries to tell you otherwise - Deep\nBlue Sea definitely is another\nJaws movie. OK, so this time the sea\nmonsters in question aren't made out\nof plywood and cardboard, but it's blatantly a Speilberg rip-off nonetheless.\nThis time around, however, the\nsharks aren't just big and toothy. Oh no\n- they're clever too. You see Samuel L Jackson has apparently invested $200\nmillion into a special project to fight\nbrain cancer, and medical biologist Saffron Burrows uses this cash to genetically\nmodify shark's brains to produce cancer\nkilling enzymes, which can then be har-vested. With me so far. Obviously, it all\ngoes pear-shaped (like all the best genetics research) and the killer fish become\nintelligent and decide to leg it before\ntheir brains get diced...\nSilly it may well sound, but director\nHarlin's fairly adept at dealing with such\nhokum nonsense (see Die Hard 2 and\nThe Long Kiss Goodnight for prime exam-ple s). However, he's also no stranger to\nbecome appal ingly bad once Hollywood\ngets its hands on them (Les Diaboliques\nand Nikita spring to mind). Damon's fanbase aren't going to be too happy\nabout their hero playing an evil psycho\neither.\nNonetheless, Minghella's back on\nfamiliar territory - big budget, beautifully shot, densely plotted romantic\nthriller - so expect an end product not\nunlike The English Patient. The socio-turkey city (Cliffhanger was bad, Cutthroat Island was painful) so it's difficult\nto know what to expect. Nonetheless a stellar cast that includes Stellan Skarsgard, Jacqueline Mckenzie and, er, LL\nCool J trapped alongside Jackson and\nBurrows in a rapidly flooding underwater\nlab should provide enough impetus to\novercome any directorial madness.\nUltimately, however, movies like this\nlive and die by their effects - and it's here\npathi c subtext should help to keep the\npace up too, so hopefully there isn't any danger of Minghella drifting into\nthe slow-moving, overly long format\nwhich was the only flaw in his previous\nfilm.\nBring all these pieces together and\nyou're left with a movie which looks like\na sure-fire favourite for at least a few\nOscar noms, making The Talented Mr\nRipleyone of this Autumn's big movies.\nthat Deep Blue Sea comes into its own.\nThe implausibly large budget has allowed\nHarlin to hire the same giant Mexican\nwater tank jim Cameron used for Titanic,\nand the shark attacks themselves (which\nmerge real-life Great Whites, CGI trickery\nand state-of-the-art me chan is ed mon-ster s) are reported to be seriously scary.\nA difficult one to call, Deep Blue Sea\ncould either be great fun, or simply too\neighties for its own good.\nMoving into the colder months usually\nsignals a spate of movies released with\none eye on the Oscars, and whilst Deep\nBlue Sea may not fit that description.\nThe Talented Mr Ripley certainly\ndoes...as does The Fight Club which\nre-unites Brad Pitt with Seven director\nDavid Fincher, in a dark brood y tale in\nwhich Pitt and co-star Ed Norton set up\na club where young men can relieve\ntheir frustrations by beating each other\nto a pulp...at the other end of the scale.\nBig Daddy star Adam Sandler presumably gave up caring about the critics\nyears ago, and instead churns out\nanother entertainingly idiotic tale in\nwhich he adopts a five year-old boy in\norder to impress his girlfriend...simi-la rly, any movie which stars Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin isn't going\nanywhere near an awards ceremony -so don't expect too much of Bowflnger,\nin which Martin is a nutty director following Murphy around with a camera\ncrew...still in the no-b rainer comedy\nvein, Mystery Men stars There's Something About Marys Ben Stiller as a member of a group of wannabe superheroes who have to stop Geoffrey Rush\nfrom taking over the world\n(nat ch)... moving back into serious\nmovie going territory, Angela's Ashes\ntells the story of a downtrodden wife\n(Emily Watson) and her alcoholic husband (Robert Carlyle) as seen through\nthe eyes of their 12 year-old son...Killing\nMrs Tingle marks Kevin Williamson's directorial debut, and has already\nkicked up a massive storm in the States,\nwhere its story - underachieving schoolgirl (Katie Holmes) goes on the ram-page, kills her classmates and kidnaps\nher teacher - was deemed to be in less\nthan the best possible taste...Mad Cows stars Anna Friel as a single mum attempting to fend off the social workers after she's thrown into jail on a trumped-up shoplifting charge...Dis-ney's next project is an animated version of Tarzan, re pleat with comedy\nsidekicks (an elephant and a female\ngorilla), evil hunter (voiced by Brian\nBlessed) and hardly any decent\ngags...this year's cheese award will\nalmost certainly go to Harrison ford\nvehicle Random Hearts, in which Ford\nand Kristin Scott-Thomas are brought\ntogether by a plane crash which kills\ntheir respective partners, and then proceed to fall in love - have the hankies\non standby...Spike Lee's back in the\nBronx with The Summer of Sam, which\nlooks at the way a70's killing spree\naffects those touched by the mur-de rer...

    "content": "I; Editorial & Columns 23 June 1999\nThe Right Thing To Do\nI was going to write the usual 'this has\nbeen my year' signing off piece, but as\nthere seems to be about ten such\ncolumns and/or editorial notes on that\nvein in this issue, I 'll spare you the agony.\nWhich, fortunately enough, started\nme thinking about an interesting ques-tion; what exactly do you lot want out of\nyour student newspaper? I am not convinced that I am any more qualified to\nanswer that question than I was nine\nmonths and thirty-one issues ago. I know\nsome of the things you don't want (Viz\nand mazes spring to mind), but then\nthat's the trouble with journalism, and\npositions of public responsibility generally;\nyou only get feedback when you get it\nwrong... Hang on, I seem to be looking\nback at the year after all...\nWhat It is to be a Hack\nMoving away from my own small world of\nFelix and into the small world of student\npolitics, I 've been attempting to pin down\nwhat it is that annoys me about hacks. Is\nit their irritating ability to habitually recite\nregulations at you whenever you ask the\nsimplest question? Not really - after all,\nsomeone somewhere has to know the\nrules. Is It the clique ness? Perhaps, but that\nis fading as the years go by and, if we\nwere being honest, is no worse than the\ninsular groups you find attached to most\naspects of society.\nI'm beginning to think it is more to do\nwith the jobs involved. Consider a company in the 'real' world. Would they ever\nallow someone with no direct experience,\nno prior knowledge and no previous in-house training to run budgets of thousands if not millions, lead policy-making\ncommittees or represent the management to important external bodies?\nAlthough the actual responsibility and\npower available to students in student\nunions is minimal, when compared to\nthat of doing a degree, it is quite striking.\nSabbaticals take up their positions\nwithout the confidence-boosting experience of promotions and pay rises behind\nthem, and sometimes it shows. Taking it\nall too seriously is one sign. Taking it as a complete joke is another. Striking the balance is difficult, as it requires experience\nand confidence. I think Dave, Chris and\nMarie have got that balance right on most\noccasions, and certainly on more than\nsome previous years' officers. As for other\nUnion hacks... well, I 'll leave that one for\nyou to decide.\nRhetoric without a Cause?\nI would like to leave with some words of\nadvice, with some grand cunningly constructed remark to remember me by, but\nto be honest I don't know how to begin.\nThe weariness that infects us s a bbs towards the end of our terms has got to\nme too, and all I can think of is sunny\nMediterranean beaches and Italian ice\ncream. Still, here goes...\nIf you want something, anything, at\nthis college, you have to fight for It. The\nUnion will help students... to an extent.\nDave Hellard has already implied twice this\nyear that students should help themselves\nwhenever possible, and I reluctantly must\nagree. If something is wrong in your hall,\nin your department, in your life, track\ndown the person responsible and tackle\nthem head on. By all means write letters\nto Felix, by all means complain to the relevant ICU officer, but this will only get you\nso far. Think your new lecture timetable\nis unfair? Write letters to your head of\ndepartment, pester them in their office\nuntil they agree to listen to you. In my\nexperience what the College can get away\nwith, it will. Don't let it.\nOn that note please don't let some of\nthe ongoing news stories from this year\nfade away. Residents at Clayponds - keep\nan eye on the financing of your new\ncommon room. Users of Portman Travel\n- complain every time you get a rough\ndeal compared to STA. All students - don't let college throw out your peers who\ncan't pay their tuition fees. Just because\nwe're not part of the NUS doesn't mean\nwe can't have a voice. I have done more\nwork this year than I did in three years of\nmy degree. University is one time, perhaps the last time, in your life that you\nhave the freedom and energy to make\nyour opinions count, to say what you\nthink and get recognition for it and, most\nimportantly, to be whoever you want to\nbe. Don't sit around complaining about\nyour course, your college or your life. Use\nyour time to act, and change them.\nGoodbye and Thank You\nAs for me? I'm off to the dizzy heights (?)\nof f SE next year, but I'm sure I 'll pop by\nand say hello occasionally. The customary\nthank yous should go here, but there's too\nmany of them - you know who you are.\nThree are worth special mention, how-ever, firstly, thanks to my girlfriend for all\nshe's put up with since Christmas1 know\nit hasn't been easy. Many many thanks to\nDavid Roberts - Felix wouldn't have happened this year without you - and best of\nluck for next year (I know you won't need\nit). Finally, thank you, the readers. You are\nthe most important part of Felix, and the\nforce that kept me going throughout this\nyear. You are also the College's most\nimportant part - don't let anyone tell you\notherwise. Have a good summer. - Ed\nFinal Thought For The Day\nH as it really been three years? Was\nit really three years ago when I was sitting on the train from Liverpool to Euston, clutching the few remnants of my childhood which I was not\ntoo afraid to bring with me? When I was\ndeciding which compartments of my\nwardrobe in Linstead should hold which\nof my possessions? Was it really three\nyears ago when my drunken alter ego\nfirst discovered the step outside Southside Bar, at the expense of one very full\npint?\nThe innocence of youth. Ain't it cute?\nI remember reading in the blurb sent by\nCollege that I was expected to be doing\nsomething like thirty hours of work per\nweek in my spare time, and I also\nremember actually believing it. I also\nrecall picking up my first copy of Felix,\nand deciding that it must be produced by\none hundred and fifty super-efficient\namphetamine-addicted thinking\nmachines. (I later discovered that it really\nthrives on an ailing set of personal computers operated by a handful of people\nwith a penchant for failing their degrees.)\nMost naive of all, though, I was convinced that Electronic Engineering would\nbe fun.\nUniversity, it seems, is a tough place.\nA great deal is expected of poor undergraduate students, especially at such a competitive, frenetic,\nand apathetic in st it u Ali Campbell\ntion as Imperial College. Many students\nhave mental health\nproblems. Pressure\ncan be enormous,\nwith financial con-strain ts; academic\nhandcuffs; pharmaceutical and alcoholic\ntemptations; unpredictable members of\nthe same or opposite\nsex, and, arguably\ntoughest of all,\nattempting to stay\nmotivated and happy\namidst all the social\nwrangling. And what\noften makes it worse\nis that no bugger will\nlisten.\nLast year, the\nh' \u2022 ; ! : , ; ,\nwrote an editorial\nlamenting the lack of\nproper emotional Cheers!\nsupport for students,\nciting his own experiences as an exam-ple. I remember reading it and feeling\nthat he was absolutely right. By the time\nyou read this I may have finished at\nImperial forever, but\non so many occasions I was convinced\nthis would never be\nthe case. When I came to London I was reeling from the\ndeath of both my par-ents. If anybody was\ngoing to struggle at\nuniversity, it was\ngoing to be me; for\nthose who attempt to\nprovide support for\nstudents, the writing\nshould really have\nbeen on the wall.\nIt would be easy\nnow to name names,-point the finger at\nthose who are supposed to be responsible for students'\nwelfare and proved\nno help at all; but I'm not really a troublemaker in these\npages, despite the\nvery occasional pop\nat Simon Baker and ICSM over the last\ntwo years. I do not pretend to know how\nto make the system better, when such a phenomenal number of potentially\nunstable students are together in one\nplace. But during those weeks I spent\nabsent from College in a state of utter\ndepression last year, when nobody\nseemed even slightly concerned, it\nbecame clear that something was very\nwrong somewhere. Students' work also\nsuffers under pressure. This undoubtedly happened to me, and is a problem\nin which academic institutions ought to\ntake more interest; it probably costs them\nmore dearly than they might think.\nProvided that these dents to my\ndegree have not been too excessive, I bring to a close what should be my final\noffering to Felix. We have seen the loss\nof the bookstore, the Print Shop and\npotentially a few other things, if current\nrumours are to be believed. We have\nseen Eric Allsop do a sponsored\nmarathon Union Presidency. (What do\nyou mean, it wasn't for charity?) And we\nhave seen the installation of some very\nexpensive granite.\nThere's no room for proper salutations here, but I want to thank everybody\nwho has been nice to me in any capacity over the last three years, especially the\nwomen. It's been tougher than you think.\nTwo fingers, though, go up to everyone\nwho has been thoughtless, selfish,\nexploitative or arrogant. Goodbye, and\ndon't forget what I said about Columbo.\n\n"

    "content": "23 June 1999 Summer Movie Preview 29\nTHE WILD WILD WEST August\nRELEASE DATE : August 13\nSTARS : Will Smith, Kevin Kline,\nKenneth Brannagh, Salma Hayek\nDIRECTOR: Barry Sonnenfeld\nRapidly becoming something of an\ninstitution, the Will Smith summer\nevent movie is one of those rare\nthings in Hollywood - a movie that can't fail. His massive following around the\nworld, coupled with wall-to-wall charisma and screen-filling presence mean\nthat even a complete dog of a script is\nguaranteed to turn a tidy profit.\nConsequently, despite some bad word-of-mouth drifting across from he States,\nit'll still be a major surprise if this does-n't turn out to be an entertaining\naction-driven smash hit.\nBased around yet another long forgotten cult sixties TV show. The Wild Wild\nWest is based around the adventures of\ntwo top-secret government agents - wisecracking ladies man Smith (as the eponymous James T West) and his\ngadget-laden sidekick Kline - assigned to\nprotect President Ulysses S Grant from\nnutty British cyborg inventor Dr Arliss\nLoveless (Kenneth Brannagh in gloriously\nover-the-top form). Oh, and Salma Hayek\nis on hand as love interest Rita Escobar.\nWhilst this may all sound like fairly standard Western-fare, it's far from it. You see,\nthe original series owed much to Jules\nVerne style contraptions, so Loveless'\nplan is to stomp on the President with a giant steam-powered mechanical tarantula - and the end product is described\nby Warner Bros as a comedy sci-fi west-ern. Make of that what you will.\nHowever, as it's directed by Men In\nBlack h elmer Barry Sonnenfeld it's likely\nto play on comedy first and foremost -and should thus come as something of\nan antidote to this summer's more serious effects based offerings. With a massive budget in place (rumours circulate\nof figures between $150 and $200 mil-lion) and featuring an array of top stars\nincluding Smith, Kline and Brannagh on\nhand, you wonder how it can possibly go\nwrong.\nTHE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR\nRELEASE DATE : August 20\nSTARS : Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo,\nDenis Leary\nDIRECTOR: John McTiernan\nPierce Brosnan continues his\nattempts to escape from Bond\ntypecasting (a feat only previously\nachieved by Sean Connery) with this remake of Steve McQueen's1968 caper\nmovie.\nBrosnan easily steps into the roll of\ndapper wealthy playboy Thomas Crown,\nwho decides to steal an incredibly valuable Monet oil painting to enliven his predictable billionaire lifestyle. Lethal\nWeapon's Rene Russo is the insurance\nagent sent to investigate (a role played\nby Faye Dunnaway in the original) who,\npredictably, falls in love with Brosnan.\nDenis Leary is also on hand as a New\nYork cop, whilst Jon McTiernan (of Die\nHard and Predator fame) settles Into the\ndirector's chair.\nMovies like this rely almost entirely\non a balance between top-notch action\nand chemistry - and The Thomas Crown\nAffair looks to have oodles of both. Early\nfootage suggests big-budget high-tech\naction, filled with the kind of gadgets and\ngizmos you'd expect a billionaire thief to\nhave at his disposal. Moreover, with \u2022\nMcTiernan calling the shots there should\nbe no danger of the action falling flat.\nThe only problem could be that he's hardly known for his dazzling ability with\nromance - however, the reportedly\nsparkling on-screen chemistry between\nthe two leads should make up for any\nproblems on that front.\nConsequently, the only big stumbling block that would seem to face\nThomas Crown are it's similarities with\nEntrapment (Sean Connery is the gentleman thief, Catherine Zeta-Jones is the\nbeautiful agent on his trail). Although it's possible that the public may not be\nenthusiastic about two Raffles-esque\nmovies in the same year, similar suggestions were made about Deep\nImpact/Armageddon and Antz/A Bugs\nLife last year - and all of them went on\nto rake in massive box office...\nAs ever, August is packed full of this\nyear's big-budget outings and no-b rainer star vehicles, with The Wild Wild West\nand The Thomas Crown Affair two of the\nbiggest - but not necessarily the\nbest...sadly for all the Claire Danes fans\nout there, seventies throwback The Mod\nSquad is, by all accounts, truly awful,\ndespite a good-looking and talented\ncast and wall-to-wall style...on the other\nhand, Eddie Murphy vehicle Life has\ngone down a storm in the States with its\ndepiction of Murphy and co-star Martin\nLawrence as wrongfully convicted felons\nlaughing their way through a sixty year\nsentence...more promising is Pushing\nTin which charts the battle between\nrivals John Cusakand Biily Bob Thornton\nto prove that they are the best air traffic controller in the west - Cate Blanchett\nand Angela jolie co-star...Hugh Grant is\ntroubled to discover that his father-in-law\n(James Caan) is the Godfather in com-ed y thriller Mickey Blue Eyes, the latest\nmovie to come from the Grant/Hurley\nproduction company Simian Films...this\nsummer's token low budget Jennifer\nAniston rom-com comes in the form of\nOffice Space, in which the Friends star\nteams up with her work mates to\ntrounce their greedy boss...massive boxoffice receipts are, sadly, guaranteed\nfor South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut,\nthanks to the massive following behind\nthe adventures of the 2-D foursome -plot details are at present sketchy...the\nheist-gone-wrong premise re-emerges\nvia Brit-flick You're Dead, which stars\nJohn Hurt and Rhys Ifans in a movie\nsimply described as 'Pulp Fiction meets\nMonty Python'...Hurt also stars in All The\nLittle Animals, as a badger rescuer who\ntakes up with retarded man Christian\nBale, who has recently escaped an abu-sive, hateful stepfather who has killed his\npets one by one...little explanation is\nrequired for Muppets From Outer Space.\nwhich sees Ray Liotta, Andie MacDowell. Gates McFadden and David Arquette\nattempt to help Gonzo to find his rightful place in the Universe.. Dudley DoRight stars Brendan Fraser and Sarah\nJessica Parke and thus, on principle,\ncan't be bad, despite the fact that it's a live action version of a cartoon about a Canadian Mountie...Drop Dead Gorgeousis a movie about beauty pageants\nstarring Denise Richards - quite frankly,\nthose few words alone should be\nenough to guarantee a profit...bizzar est concept of the month goes to Being\nJohn Malkovltch, in which a puppeteer\n(John Cusack) discovers a door in his\noffice that allows him to enter the mind\nof John Malkovich (played, un sur pris ingly, by john Malkovitch) for 15 minutes\n- which he then attempts to turn into a small business...\n\n"
