Above the arms of the club, the axe of\nthe examiner crossed with the iron rod of discipline; below is the club motto \"Per Ardua ad\nSc lent i a.\" The background of the badge is a white fog, and the edge a brown halo.\nYours abstractedly, \"Browning.\"\n3 ir, The annual orgy of fresher s' teas now being\nover we can probably assume that, apart from the\nperiodical exhortations of ' Felix' the 'brown-bagge r',ten to fiver' or what have you, will now\nbe allowed to follow the road to his own destruct ion unchecked.\nHowever, there is a category of student unconsidered by the exponents of the 'work hard and\nplay hard' school of oratory but which is usually included in the term 'brown-b agger', namely - the\n'green-ticket er'. This man, his face pasty through the hours\nspent underground, his body bruised by the pummel-ling s of rush-hour crowds, spends a large part of\nhis time and grant in the daily trek to and from\nthe college. He is a phenomenon peculiar to the\nUniversity of London. His is the task of patting a\" quart into a half pint pot for which he.has\" '.\nthe consolation of knowing that time spent in the\nbus queue keeps him in contact with the everyday\nworld unlike the unfortunate inmates of such\nsheltered nurseries as Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe only solution is for I.C. to become a completely residential college and this should be\nthe declared aim of the Governing Body. It is obviously a long term view and one which none of\nus can hope to see achieved; but a more vigorous\nattempt to increase hostel ac como dati on than has\nbeen shown in the past will at least provide hope\nfor the next generation.\nYours etc., 'Halang'.\nSCOTTISH COUNTRY DANCING\n19th Oct.51\nSirI have with regret noticed the discontinuation\nthis year of the weekly Scottish Country Dance\nevenings,which Ashley Bean introduced in the new\nlounge last year with considerable success.

Consequently we wish to assess\nthe support that such a venture would receive.. We believe that in I.C. lies the enthusiasm\nand ability necessary to make this sound and\npractical proposition. Is this not an answer to\nthose who are of the opinion that I.C. has a 'middle-aged' complex?\nAlready a framework is in existence and all it needs is the material to fill it. We are asking your readers to volunteer active support as soon\nas possible. What we want are ideas, scripts, music, and personal talent both for solo and group\nitems. We would like anyone Interested to contact\nus personally, by letter or through your columns.\nWe are sure that ouch a novel venture will soon receive the support it requires.

Boxing team competed in the U.L. trials in an effort\nto win the \"Harry Preston\" Cup.\nThroughout the evening a close finish seemed\ncertain, and until the last two bouts I.C. still held on grimly to a fragile lead.\nLondon Hospital took, the lead with the Welterweight final still to be decided, but King's came\nup from third position in an exciting finish.\nFinal positions and points were:\nKing's London Hospital\nI.C.

During the past year much work has been put\nin by the members and committee, in between\ntaking a very active pert in a long series of matches, most of which resulted in wins for the\nU.L.

Gliding Club from 22nd to 29th July, and for\nthe first time, consisted of a series of set tasks as\nopposed to the previous free-for-all flying. This produced keen and even spectacular competition.\nWhen it was planned to enter an I.C. team, it was\nfelt that it should contain two pilots (who could rapidly\nbecome accustomed to local conditions); that there should\nbe first-rate returning facilities end that as many blind-flying aids as possible should be included. In the event,\nthese conditions were satisfied and the team consisted of\nRon Macfie and Frank Irving (pilots') with Dick Watson and\nBob Gerhardi (crew). The latter happened to possess a \"Vanguard\" van capable of towing a glider trailer at a gratifying, if somewhat illegal, \"relativity\". The glider\nitself i/ aa a shining cream \"Olympia\" complete with electric\nartificial horizon and pit ot de-ice r. The first competition day yielded no marks after Ron\nMacfie's long hill struggle. The second day's task was\na race to Dunstable, and saw Irving come unstuck only 12\nmiles from Camphill; to be joined in the same field by the\nArmy \"Olympia\" (12 marks). Ron obtained a few marks next\nday for gain of height and the day after drizzle stopped\nflying. The following day (Thursday) Irving attempted an\nR5-mile glide from Camphill, but only reached Driffield,\n75 miles away. This was quite a few marks to the good,\nbut another glider at Driffield also was returning from\nFlar..borough Head i Friday saw Ron trying to ascend a \"standing wave\" and\nbusily dodging others trying to do the same. Saturday's task was to fly to Eoothferry Bridge on the Humber and\nreturn to Camphill. Frank covered the L5 miles to the,\nbridge quite smartly and noticed there that Jonne Welch,\nour chief instructor, had had to land there I The wind\nhad gr s at ly inc reps ed on his return and Frank could only\nnak e15 miles in returning before landing. Few others\nfared much better. Sunday's task (the last) was a race\nto Derby 'd rome and back. Both I.C. men were unlucky in\nstarting and were still grounded when the early birds re-turned, when things were really exciting.\nThe final placing put I.C.12 th in the team entries\nand best of the 3 Olympia teams from Redhill. Lessons\nlearnt were that artificial horizons are good things,\nefficient retrieving is vital, petrol is horribly expensive\nand that task flying is immense fun.\nThe championship meteorologists were Dr. Serrer and\nMr. Ludlow of the Department of Meteorology, assisted by\nthree students. Their organization was first-rate and\nmade a breath-taking contribution tc the final party.\nAll things considered, I.C. was reasonably well to the\nfore at Camphill.\nGOLF On Wednesday, October 17ta,.,I. C.G. A. played\nits first match of the season,against University College at Fulwell.The match ended in a victory for us by, i matches to 2. Ken Glover,playing no. 1\nwon Kl s match by 4 up and 2 to play.He went round\nin74,2 strokes above the strict par of the course\nD.W. ROWING\nOn Saturday, 13th. October, the Autumn Clinker Eights, for the Sabin Tankard, was won by Lensbury\nR.C., I. C.B.C. being the other finalists. In their heat I.C. were drawn against Ibis and King's. After leading to the Brook, I.C. were overtaken by Ibis, but managed to fight back and lead by 3 feet. In\nthe f' nal, however, Lensbury led all the way and\nwon by 2 lengths.\nThe most obvious criticism is that I.C. rowed\nlike eight men in a boat and not as a or ew. TL.

    "content": "4\nFEL IX PROFILE - Pint stiff IT HS It was with j;r eat difficulty that our s pac lal correspondents managed to gain an audience with\nDavid Griffiths. Despite the pressing demands of\nthe Royal School of Mines Centenary, the great man\nspared us a few moments. From what he said we\ngathered that he was born at an early age in the\nonce peaceful town of Sunbury. he was christened\nDavid (a Welsh name, although he is of English descent) ana after an undistinguished school\ncareer marked only by notoriety, he misguide ly spent 18 months at Bourne Polytechnic which he then\ndeserted for the Army. David's efficiency in keeping\nthe Jews and Arabs apart in Palestine, and his skilful handling of Egyptian donkeys during his4 year\nmilitary career raised him to the unprecedented\nheight of Captain.\nDavid came to the R.S. M.in1948, and immediately distinguished himself by a, short speech and an\neven shorter yard (10.2 seo on ds) fat the Freshers'\nDinner. In spite of his slight weakness for beer\nhe proved to be a very capable hockey player,\nbecoming secretary of the R.S. M. Hockey Club for the\n50-'51 season. The earlier part of Saturdays he devoted to playing rug ger for his Old Boys side.Unfor-tun at ely the Mines rug ger club has been unable to undermine his allegiance to the hockey club on\nWednesdays. Since his recent vacation in Canada he\nhas, however, been converted to baseball, which it is felt will conflict somewhat with his hockey.\nHe still manages, despite the demands of the\nR.S. M. Centenary, to maintain his carefree exterior an attitude which, at school, earned him the name\n''Sunshine\". Likewise his term of office as pre s ident of the R.S. M. during the forthcoming year will doubtless cast no shadowy effect. His efficiency and leadership have already made themselves apparent although the former quality had previously been\nproved when he filled the post of secretary of the\nR.S. M. union for the year '50-'51.\nAlthough it is only early in the new term, he \\\nis already proving to be a very popular and well liked President. The unsuspected qualities of diplomacy were revealed in his handling of this years'\nMines* Freshers Dinner.\nUnlike the majority of Miners, David professes\na keen interest in art, literature and music. The\nlatter is shown by his'' progressive\" compositions\non the guitar. His ability to charm the weaker sex\nis, of course, already well known - this is accredited to his magnificent \" froth filter\". In conclusion we should like to express our\nappreciation of the good work he Is doing, and\nwish him continued success in each of his many\nfields of activity. THE FRESHER S RECEPTIONS These have taken place in the Union on succ et ive Fridays since the beginning of the term, beginning\nwith the R.C.S. on the 5th. October, and followed by\nC. and G. on the 12th., and the R.S. M. on the 19th. The R.C.S. were honoured by the presence of the\nRector, Sir Roderic Hill. In his speech he emphasised that the purpose of a University education was \"\nnot only to extract learning from the College, but\nalso one must endeavour to leave one's mark by\nputting something into the corporate life of the\ncommunity''.\nThe receptions all followed similar lines with\nspeeches oy distinguished quests and Union officials, toasts proposed and answered. The speeches\nusually praised the College and its students, and\nexhorted the latter not to brown bag... The Union Presidents attended each others'\nfunctions, presumably to obtain firsthand inform-ation of. any slanderous statements. There were no\nreciprocal arrangements with I.C. W.A.A deplorable trend was noticed among the fresh ers. Quite early in the evening they began politely refusing the free beer offered to them, It is to be\nhoped that this unfortunate state of affairs will be remedied in the near future. In spite of prevent ing the waste of beer that might have been caused\nby this trend, the older students remained remarkably sober, and many were seen walking home.\nI. C.W. A., of course, were different. Their\nreception was held on a Tuesday, the 16th.,in their lounge, with no speeches and no beer.\nPOL LITT The Joint Freshers' tea of a Literary and\nDebating Society, with the Political Society has\nonce again carried of fits annual confidence trick successfully. The tea opened as usual to the\nsatisfying sound of sandwiches being demolished,\nand after a respectable time lapse, the chairman,\nMam Sobey, in a nice soothing address staked his claim on the Fresher market and gave an outline of\nthe Political Society's aims and programme. Ke\nwas supported in a more partisan3 pir it by the\nchairman of the various sub-groups, but the aura\nof impartial stability was soon restored when the\nPresident of the Literary and Debating Society,\nTed Simon, discussed the relative merits of the\nbar and the Society as a means of self expression. He mentioned also the Society's desire to supplement the time-honoured Bedford Debates by arranging further debates with R.C.A. and R.C.M., and\nby cleaning up the U.L. U. championships.\nHaving lulled its audience into a pleasing sense of\nsecurity the Chair then lit the fuse of the big gun by\nintroducing Professor Levy who had consented for the twentieth Tea to deliver the blow intended to shatter the complacency of his audience. In typical style Prof. Levy\nopened \"I am not going to be political, I am not going to\nbe provocative, I am going to talk about Russia.\" He went.,\non to describe a visit he had made, as one of a delegation,\nto Russia, and particularly to Uzbekistan in Soviet Asia.\nHis main purpose, it seemed was to point out the tremendous\neffort being made in Russia towards the raising of their\n.economic standards. He mentioned as an example the enormous university Just built outside Moscow on the1 Lenin Hills,\nwith hostel accommodation for 6,600 of the total 10,000\nstudent population. He remarked particularly on the fine\nflats provided for staff.\nAs an argument against those who allege Soviet\naggressive plans, he spoke of the apparent absence of good\nroads across the major part of the country, a remark vh ich got him into trouble with Dai Nicholas afterwards, who\nflatly stated that good roads to the frontier were not\nnecessary for an aggressive war.\n- As Tony Peacock said in his vote of thanks to Professor Levy there was nothing left for anyone to say so we\npassed out and were received by the cool night air. UNBEARABLE NEWS\nMr.Ch'en states that among Asiatic races \"Birth-control is inconceivable.\"\nThe Tiass, Oct. 9th. "

October\n16th. the refectory accounts for the year ending\n31st. July were presented. These showed that a definite improvement in the financial state of the ,\nrefectory had taken place since the taking over of\nthe management by John Gardners Ltd. It is anticipated that in a full year the loss will be reduced\nto a manageable figure.\n. The committee also discussed the use of Ayrton\nHali for club functions, the details of which are\nbeing worked out. Owing to the expense entailed in\nthe recent improvement of refectory facilities on lj the'more formal dinners are likely to be held there.\nThe bar account, which has now been separated\nfrom that of the refectory, shows a decrease4 n profit from about 15){ of turnover in 19i95m#p3% in 1930-31.

Clearly this could\nnot continue. To meet the situation an external\ncatering firm, John Gardner, who were successfully\nrunning refectories at U.C. and Goldsmiths were\nasked to take over the management of our refectory.\nThe present financial position, as reflected in the accounts recently presented, is most encouraging\nand has fully justified the Refectory Committee's action in calling in an external firm of managers.\nThe quality of the meals, while not being out stand ing, is probably as good as can be expected for the\ncost and is as high as that prevailing under previous regimes.\nA praiseworthy attempt to improve the atmosphere\nat supper has been made with the introduction, three\nweeks ago, of a waitress service. This started badly,\nimproved slowly, and is now accepted as almost\nestablished. Unfortunately, the Lower Dining Room\nwith its service counter dominating one end does not\nlend itself to a restaurant atmosphere.\nThe main objection is the effect on the cost of\nliving index which is rising of its own accord'with-out any additional help from the refectory.\nTo sum up :- the idea seems a good one but the\nlimitations Imposed by pocket, and premises must be\nborne in mind.\nYOU,YOU,a YOU.\nAnyone who ha3 ever thought of helping FELIX\nshould get in touch with us. No experience is nec-ess ary, but a little spate time, and the need for an opportunity to learn to write are the best qualifications. Articles, letters, reviews, and cartoons are\nespecially welcome from contributors who have not\nthe time for the routine of the Board, and the \\\nEditor would be pleased to meet prospective cor- ;\nrespondents.\nThe FELIX typing problem has been partially solved by the kind assistance of the London College\nof Secretaries, but we desperately need a typist to\nhelp us at the fortnightly Sunday make-up meetings.\nThe work is paid and interesting; and the FELIX\nSecretary and the Assistant News Editor are avail able as chaperones.\nMore Myrtle\nKiss Joan Spencer, having completed a general\neducation at I.C., and awarded a bachelors' Degree\nby the Botany Department last June, is now lear ning typing at L.C.3. in order to obtain a Job.\nOne of the more/less* deplorable repercussions\nof the social and technological upheaval that\nstarted in the latter half of the 18th Century\nand culminated in the 1851 Exhibition, was the\nRoyal School of Mines. To the catalogue of\ncatastrophes thrown up on the wake of the Indust rial Revolution - the Napoleonic Wars, the Reform\nBill of 1832, the Repeal of the Corn Laws in1846 was added, in1851, the foundation of the Government School of Mines and of science Applied to t ne Arts. Henry Thomas De la Beche (1796-1855), last male descendant of a member of William the Conqueror's Expeditionary Force, and one of the\nearliest fellows of the then recently founded\nGeological Survey in1832, worked indefatigably for the foundation of a college of mining tech\u00bb\nno logy. His chance came when he secured support\nof the Prince Consort, and the Royal Commissioners\nof the Exhibition of 1851 realised a surplus of\nover \u00a3200,000 (0 Tempora, 0 to res'.). The Government School was opened in Jermyn Street on Kover.ber\n6th1851, and the education of the troglodytes\nbegan.\nThe task was one of uncommon difficulty and\nDe la Beche had to enlist the aid of the heaviest\navailable guns - Playfair( Chemistry), Ramsay\n(Geology), Forbes (Palaeontology), Warington\nSmyth (Mining) and Hunt (Kechanical Science)and two years later of the Royal College of\nChemistry, which had been founded in1845. De\nla Beche was succeeded by Sir Roderick Sturchison,\nfrom the light of pure science.\nThe School was removed,piecemeal fashion,\nto the Huxley Building in South Kensington between\n1872 and 1880 and was there renamed \"The Normal\n(from 1890 \"She Royal\") School of Science and the\nRoyal School of Mines\", under the Directorship of\nT.H. Huxley. Dr. Percy, then in charge of metallurgy\nresigned rather than remove and was succeeded by\nProf. Roberts-Austin. Warington Smyth remained at\nJermyn Street until his death 1890, when the Mining\nDepartment passed to Le Keve Foster and the Huxley\nBuilding,.\nIn 1907 the Boardiof Education gave up\nthe unequal fight. The troglodytes,incurably\n\"nasty,brutish and short\"(Hobbes) were carefully separated from the R.C.S.; the City and\nGuilds College were thrown in to increase the\naverage density and I.C. was granted its Charter. By 1913 the quarantine buildings,\nerected for the Miners in Prince Consort Rd,\nwere complete and a proper segregation ach-eiv ed. Senescence set in. The R.S. M. grew\nold, faithfull j tended and cared for by the\nR.C.S. and the C. and 0.\nEut it is feared/hoped*that a severe\nand perhaps fatal centenary will develop\nbefore Felix goes to Press and the authorities are taking appropriate precautions.\nA service of commemoration at Holy\nTrinity was held yesterday.\n'Delete according to taste.\n\n"
