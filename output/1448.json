Google\u2019s assault on the slow web kicked off with\nthe now ubiquitous Chrome, which\nthis week made its way in beta form to\nOSX and Linux, joining Windows.\nNext up in the onslaught was the\nannouncement of SPDY, a replacement for HTTP that is meant to speed\nup webpage delivery by two-fold. For\nthose not in the know, HTTP is the\nstandard that allows webservers and\nyour browser to talk to each other.\nIt\u2019s an interesting development for\nsure, everyone likes more speed and\nGoogle\u2019s proposing an implementation\nwhere HTTP and SPDY work side-by-side. Will this be a Google Chromeonly enhancement? I don\u2019t know but\none day you might just be typing spdy:\ninstead of http: into your address bar.\nGoogle wasn\u2019t done however with\njust the computer server interconnect;\nits next target was the DNS. Google\nunveiled its public DNS service which\nit claims can speed up your browsing\nexperience by using Google\u2019s indexing power. A DNS acts like an address\nbook by matching the alphabetic characters you type into your address bar\nas a URL to the IP address of the web-server you\u2019re trying to reach. Normally,\nthis service is provided by your ISP or\ncompany servers and operates totally\ntransparently meaning you\u2019ll probably\nnever notice it. Sometimes, your ISP\nwill change the \u2018page not found\u2019 message to something they provide; Virgin\nMedia for instance does this as another\nway to serve you ads.\nGoogle reckons that due to its expansive knowledge of the world\u2019s websites\nthanks to its indexing and crawling\nof every website on the planet for the\nlast decade, its DNS service is not only\nmuch more comprehensive, but also\nfaster than your ISPs. Sounds great in\ntheory; after all, the faster you can turn\nyour URL into an IP address the faster\nyou can pull down a webpage - but is it\nany use in the real world?\nRecent offhand testing by myself as\nwell as others around the web have\nshown that Google\u2019s public DNS is at\nleast as fast as your ISPs. Whether it\u2019s\nactually any faster is pretty difficult\nto determine, thanks to all the variance produced by differing connection\nspeeds, pings and traffic loads. You\nmight find Google will resolve that\nURL for you faster than your ISP at\npeak times, so perhaps it\u2019s worth trying out on a case-by-case basis.\nYou might ask why Google is doing all this just to speed up your web\nbrowsing experience; what\u2019s in it for\nthem? Well, Google being the world\u2019s\nlargest online advertising service\nmakes its money by getting eyeballs\non ads. It\u2019s done this through quality search and all the other services it\nprovides such as Gmail and Gdocs.\nBy speeding up the web experience of\nyour general internet user, you can get\nthem more and more hooked onto the\ninternet. You can serve them more adverts faster and keep your advertisers\npaying more by providing better and\nbetter targeting of their adverts. It\u2019s all\nabout ads and money, not some higher\npurpose.\nThis term saw the felix technology\nsection brought to you by myself, Samuel Gibbs, along with Feroz Salam\nand Simon Worthington, Technology\nReporters with guest articles from Ben\nSmith, felix Photographer. If you think\nyou\u2019ve got what it takes to write articles for the felix Technology section\nand want to join a growing team, then\nsend me an email to:\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nIt\u2019s almost Christmas and everyone is\nwaiting with baited breath to see what\nthe Christmas gadget of choice is going\nto be. My money is on the iPod Touch\nor the iPhone, but I wish it was the\nPrinter Toaster.\nYes, you read that right; the Printer\nToaster toasts your bread, one slice at\na time, using a bread feeder mimicking\nan ink jet printer. Genius.\nTechnology at large is predominantly built around visual interaction, but\nwhat happens if you\u2019re blind? Braille\nisn\u2019t exactly easy to create dynamically\nbut the Squibble pocketable Braille\ninterface aims to change that. Using\n779 ultrasonic motors to push illuminated caps against a silicon over-lay, the Squibble allows phones and\nother Bluetooth-enabled devices to\nbe controlled using Braille letters and\nother easy-to-understand icons. The\npocket-friendly device even has audio\nfeedback and a grip that allows you\nto read the Braille without having to\nput it down, unlike some other Braille\nreaders.\nOK, so hybrid cars like the Prius are\npretty dull. They might help you save\nthe environment - even that\u2019s debatable - but why can\u2019t you have a car that\ndoesn\u2019t look like a box on wheels whilst\nyou\u2019re at it? Well, Capstone might just\nanswer your prayers with the CMT380 hybrid supercar.\nLooking like a cross between a Corvett and the Batmobile, the 380 boasts\nimpressive specs. How does 0-60MPH\nin 3.9 seconds grab you? That\u2019s not\nall either, as it\u2019s got a top speed of\n150MPH and an 80 mile cruise range\non just battery power. The most unconventional aspect of the Capstone\nhas to be the diesel microturbine in the\nback, rather than a conventional internal combustion engine. So what\u2019s the\ncatch? How about a $200,000 asking\nprice? Not exactly student-friendly, but\nif anyone has a rich parent with money\nto burn and the Earth to save, maybe\nsuggest they buy you one to cruise\nabout London in.\nFusion Garage, the manufacturing partner of Michael Arrington\u2019s\nCrunchPad has unveiled what they\u2019re\nI\nt\u2019s that time of year again, yes it\u2019s\nChristmas! The time for family\ngatherings, gorging on rich food,\nsloshing it down with lots of drink\nand passing out in front of the telly.\nOK, so not everyone loves a Christmas like the Royal Family, but I can\nguarantee that pretty much everyone\nloves presents and what makes a better\npresent than a gadget?\nIt\u2019s not even just the tech-enthused\nthat love a good gadget at Christmas\neither. Your sister, your Mother or even\nyour Dad probably got something like\nan iPod for Christmas at one stage or\nanother and while they might not see\nit, that\u2019s a gadget!\nSo to mark the occasion, we here in\nthe tech section thought we\u2019d put our\nheads together and come up with our\nfavourite gadgets for Christmas.\nOK, so Simon\u2019s not the biggest of\nApple fanboys on the whole, but even\nhe can recognise a top-quality piece of\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor calling the Joojoo. Yeah, it\u2019s a stupid\nname, but the device itself has some\nreal potential. According to Fusion\nGarage, the device which is essentially\na web browser tablet was already underway before Arrington stuck his oar\nin. Whether that\u2019s the case is anyone\u2019s\nguess, but the Joojoo runs a UNIXbased custom OS, weighs just over\n1kg and wields a 12.1\u201d capacitive touch\nscreen. With a 9 seconds boot time,\n4GB SSD, WiFi, an accelerometer and\nabout 5 hours surfing time per charge,\nit all sounds good until you hit the\nprice: $499. Ouch. Pre-orders are being taken from December 11th, but at\nroughly \u00a3308, I can\u2019t see it being as big\na hit as the Arrington-promised price\nof about $300. I\u2019ll stick with my Dell\nMini 10 hackintosh, thanks.\nvironment bespoke to the mini-mar-vel, but can be programmed from your\nchoice of Windows, Linux or Mac.\nThe Arduino comes in several shapes\nand sizes down to the smallest of the\nbunch, the Nano.

What if evolution\ncreated our belief in God?\nThe claim is not as absurd as it\nsounds. After all, religious belief itself\nis a massive conundrum. Religious\nideas are common to all cultures of\nthe world despite the fact that we can\nnever hope to verify these beliefs. To\nuse an analogy akin to Russell\u2019s teapot,\nif I told you that there was an invisible\npink flying elephant called Percy orbiting my head, then the chances are you\nwould not believe me and most people\nwould either ask for proof or attempt\nto verify my claim.\nHowever, we are persuaded to believe when it comes to stories of supernatural beings walking on water,\nmiracle healings and the power of\nforesight, which all seem to contradict\nthe laws of science. It has been shown\nthat in times of hardship such as in the\naftermath of the Wall Street Crash of\n1929, humans are more inclined towards religious belief. So why do we\nbelieve?\nThis is a question which has largely\nevaded scientific enquiry up until now.\nRight from the beginning, even Darwin\nhimself skirted around the question in\nhis consideration of natural selection.\nThe fact is that subjecting religious belief to scientific enquiry is very much\ntaboo and always has been. Religious\nbelief has always been a puzzle to\nscientists.\nWhen Dawkins\u2019 reductionist view\non genetics is considered, then some\nof the values which religion embraces\nsuch as altruism and charity would\noffer no benefit to the individual\nthrough the course of evolution. If we\nare indeed, only vehicles for our selfish genes, then why would our genetic\nmake-up favour acts of one-way altru-ism. It is seemingly nonsensical.\nMany scientists have put forward\nhypotheses about religious belief. Although, as Stephen Pinker highlights,\nvery few scientists would point to the\nexistence of a \u2018God gene\u2019 or a \u2018God\nmodule\u2019 in our brain, many evolutionary biologists are now beginning to\nview religion in the context of evolu-tion. The idea is that religious belief\nprovides a functional advantage to\nthe individual who believes and thus\nincreases that individual\u2019s chances of\nsurviving and passing on their genes\nto the next generation. This idea does\nnot appear too far-fetched when you\nconsider the placebo effect in medi-cine. Studies have suggested that some\ndrugs such as the pre-operative anxi-ety-relieving drug diazepam do not\nfunction unless the patient knows that\nthey are being given it.\nKarl Marx has described religion\nas the \u2018opiate of the masses\u2019. Indeed,\none idea is that religion makes us\nfeel better about our lives and also\ngives us purpose in life. Religious belief might also allow us to feel as if\nwe have some control over different\naspects of the world \u2013 after all, this\nmight be where beliefs such as miracle healings stem from. In fact, it has\nbeen shown that belief does indeed\nhave physiological effects on the\nThe LHC has been subject to much\nmedia coverage and criticism since it\nwas started up last September only to\nbreak down little more than a week lat-er, but the first results from the record-breaking particle accelerator are finally\nin. Admittedly, nothing earth-shatter-ing has been discovered yet, but the\nturnaround speed of the paper alone\nmust be a record.\nThe first collisions took place\non Monday 23rd November and\nsince then the twin proton beams\nhave reached an energy of 1.18TeV,\nsmashing the previous record of\n0.98TeV. Researchers working on\nALICE, one of the six experiments\nwithin the LHC, however, took data\nfrom some of the very first collisions\nwhen the protons were circulating\nat only 450GeV per beam. They had\ntheir paper accepted by the European\nJournal of Physics just 8 days after\nthe collisions took place. Presumably,\nmost of the paper was already written before the LHC was even fired\nup, with gaps left to fill the results in\nwhen they came.\nBefore being accepted by the European Journal of Physics, the paper was\npublished online at arXiv.org, an open-access repository for scientific papers\nnot yet published elsewhere. Anyone\ninterested in the paper can read it on-line, but be warned, you\u2019ll have to skip\nto page 6 to even get to the abstract\ndue to the list of authors (over two\npages worth) and involved institutes\n(more than 100 in total).\nIn the paper, Aamodt and colleagues describe how some 284 events\nrecorded in the first collisions were\nused to measure something called the\npseudorapidity density of the charged\nparticles. Pseudorapidity is used in\nparticle physics to describe the angle\nof the particle beam relative to the\naxis. This may not sound very excit-ing, but the ALICE collaboration are\npleased as the results agree with theory and previous experiments, meaning that the LHC is working well and\nshould provide high quality data to\nwork with when they get to the really\ninteresting stuff.\nThe first super high energy collisions at the LHC are on track to start\nin early 2010, and will reach energies\nof 3.5TeV per beam.\nbody, particularly whilst engaging in\nritualistic dance, such as the release\nof cortisone and endorphins by the\nbody, natural painkillers.\nThis point is reinforced by recent\nresearch conducted by EXREL (Ex-plaining Religion) - a research group\nset up to scientifically investigate the\nphenomena of religious belief. This\ngroup has taken a big step in breaking down the barrier which had for so\nlong made the scientific enquiry of religious belief taboo. As Dr Steve Jones\nexplained in a lecture given on \u2018Nature\nvs. Nurture\u2019, EXREL uses a term called\n\u2018religiosity\u2019 to classify a person\u2019s willingness to believe. EXREL also utilises\nfMRI (functional magnetic resonance\nimaging) and PET (positron emission\ntomography) scans to see which parts\nof the brain illuminate in religious and\nnon-religious people. An interesting\nfinding is that the levels of dopamine\nin the brain affect religiosity and people with Parkinson\u2019s disease are less\ninclined towards religious belief.\nFurthermore, as the philosopher and\nsociologist Emile Durkheim argues, religion acts as \u2018social glue\u2019. It keeps people together and gives people a sense\nof community and belonging. This\nwould have been particularly useful in\nthe early hunter-gatherer environment\nor even as primates where sticking together in a tight-knit cohesive group\nwould have conferred an advantage to\neach individual in the group in terms\nof survival. When considering evolutionary game theory and the famous\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma, there will be fewer\nCan science explain religious belief? Apparently so...\nindividuals who defect.\nLudwig Feuerbach may have been\nright when he argued that \u201cGod is a\nprojection of the human mind\u201d, but\nnot all scientists agree that religion\nis an adaption. Many scientists view\nreligion as a by-product of the evolution of the human brain. Indeed, it is\npossible to map the different \u2018phases\u2019\nof religious belief i.e. the development\nof religious belief, alongside the development of the human brain through\nthe course of human evolution. Essentially, our brains evolved to fulfil\nan entirely different function and as\na result, religious belief emerged as a\nby-product. Some scientists feel that\nit could be linked to our propensity to\nbelieve in things we are told as a child.\nAs an example, take red blood cells.\nThe fact that red blood cells are red\nis a by-product of the evolution of the\ncells themselves. Red blood cells are\nred as a result of haemoglobin which is\nrequired to carry oxygen in the blood\n\u2013 evolution creating the haemoglobin\nmolecule gave us red blood.\nWhilst religion may have been used\nto subjugate the masses throughout\nhistory or as an excuse for a politically-motivated war, such that many people\nincluding Dawkins would question the\nbenefits of religion in a modern-day\nsociety. Whilst the \u2018God Delusion\u2019 may\nbe the case, belief can be rationally and\nscientifically explained and it raises\nthe question of whether religious belief is \u2018the path of least resistance\u2019 and\nwhether it is atheism that requires active thought and effort.\nOver a year since the first \u2018switch-on\u2019 and several setbacks later, CERN finally delivers first results from LHC\nResult: After just eight days, the ALICE team had the data needed to sumbit a paper to the European Journal of Physics\nA chicken and egg situation: Is science the cause of our beliefs?\n\n"

In contrast the United\nStates has offered to reduce its own emissions by 17% below 2005 levels (which\namounts to a mere 1.3% below 1990 levels). Big developing country polluters,\nincluding China and India, have promised to reduce their carbon intensity (CO2\nemissions per unit of GDP), but both expect their total emissions to continue\nrising.

    "content": "20\nFILM\nFilm Editors Zuzanna Blaszczak & Ed Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009\nLies abound in the excellent Mascarades\nJadeHoffman\nThere\u2019s a kind of dread that surrounds\nadaptations of classics, especially\nwhen it comes to childhood treasures\nlike Maurice Sendak\u2019s widely-loved\nbook, Where The Wild Things Are.\nHow can a group of Hollywood filmmakers possibly do justice to these\nfragile relics from your childhood?\nAnd what if they can\u2019t?\nThese must have been thoughts\nclose to Sendak\u2019s heart. Published\nin 1963, it has taken more than forty\nyears for him to pick director Spike\nJonze for the much-contested opportunity to craft a feature film from\nthis book. When he did, however,\nhe did so with an unusual amount of\ntrust and abandonment, encouraging\nJonze to reinvent it as he saw fit, and\nto morph it into his own unique style.\nThe result is this: a visually stunning\nworld that is unexpectedly raw and\nemotionally-charged.\nAfter the film had finished playing,\nSpike Jonze fidgeted in his swivel chair\nand pulled up his bright red socks when\nthey slipped down. Of course, the Being\nJohn Malkovich director would be able\nto pull off a film like this but surpris-ingly, Sendak actually had to convince\nhim to take the project on board as\nJonze, who had himself loved the book\nas a child, did not feel he could. When\nhe did though, it was with a vision of\nmaking it less about the Wild Things as\nmonsters, but embodiments of those\nwild and strong emotions you grow\nup struggling to understand. After an\nargument with his sister and mother,\nMax (portrayed magnificently by Max\nRecords) runs away and encounters the\nWild Things who are neurotic and par-anoid, scared and confused. Like a foil\nfor Max\u2019s own frustration and fears,\nthey magnify everything he\u2019s feeling;\nbouncing between elation and despair\nin seconds. And that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s\nso striking about this film, it\u2019s personal\nand intense and thus described as not\nso much a film for children, but about\nchildhood .\nNot just from Jonze\u2019s interpretation,\neither, but from co-writer Dave Eggers\u2019,\ntoo. Eggers\u2019 debut book charted the\nyears of his life following his parents\u2019\ndeath which left him to raise his 8-year\nold brother at the age of 21. He was\nnot a screenwriter when he worked on\nthis project with Jonze but his input is\nclearly felt in the precise and powerful\ndialogue (although this does, disap-pointingly, sometimes verge on expo-sitional). On the subject of the film\u2019s\nfive-year production, Jonze says, \u201cA\nlot of the people who worked on the\nmovie hadn\u2019t done things like this before.\u201d And it shows. Not in a technical\nsense, the film itself is extremely well-cast and comes with a superb soundtrack from Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 very own\nWild Thing, Karen O, but in the unfettered earnestness that colours this\ncarefully shaped film. It does not cut\ncorners: before getting his voice cast\ntogether to record, Jonze took them\n\u2013 James Gandolfini, Forest Whitaker,\nCatherine O\u2019Hara et al. to have a real\ndirt clod fight in a nearby park so to\ngive Max Records something to react\nto when filming without the puppets.\nJonze would perform spontaneous\nstunts like \u201cshooting the sound director with a fire extinguisher\u201d. Didn\u2019t he\nalso learn to eat fire? Jonze smiles and\nnods, \u201cBadly.\u201d\nBut maybe this passion is also where\nthe film falls down. It is so burdened\nwith the personal contributions of the\nwhole cast and crew that it sometimes\nstruggles to hold itself together. As the\nfilm progresses, you get the sense of\nits direction being pushed around by\nall these different intentions. It causes\nthe focus to slip occasionally, and can\nsometimes be quite overwhelming;\na sort of too-many-cooks situation.\nHowever it\u2019s rather difficult to blame\nthem for this though. The adaptation\nhas been one of the most anticipated\nfilms of its kind, and it\u2019s the attention\nto detail that makes it so impressive.\nFrom the Wild Things\u2019 puppets (as\nbuilt by Jim Henson\u2019s workshop) to the\nspectacular cinematography featuring\ntruly beautiful sets against the backdrop of the Australian landscape, Jonze\nhas created something here which is\ntouching, enthralling and really quite\npowerful.\nFrench-Algerian production Mascarades is an independent film currently undergoing a limited release at\nthe cin\u00e9 lumi\u00e9re in South Kensington,\nand if you get chance to see it, I highly\nrecommend that you do.\nLyes Salem writes, directs and\nstars in this tale of Mounir, an Algerian man stuck in mediocrity and\nmocked by his friends. However one\ndrunken night he fabricates a lie\nthat his narcoleptic sister is to be\nmarried to a wealthy gentleman\nand finds himself trapped\nin a masquerade that he\nfinds increasingly difficult to end. His sister also happens to\nhave other ideas; she\nplans to marry the\nlocal laughing stock\nKhliffa, but this\ndoesn\u2019t go down\ntoo well with\nMounir. Mounir\nfinds his lie gives\nhim a power\nand a sense of\nworth which he\nis reluctant to\nrelinquish. But despite his flaws, underneath it\u2019s obvious he is a devoted\nfamily man.\nSalem\u2019s first feature length film is\nfunny and charming. The whole thing\noozes a character driven warmth\nwhich will make you connect with\nthe small town Algerian setting in a\nway that will have you pining for the\nsimple life. The performances are not\nonly believable but highly relatable\nand demonstrate that however different our backgrounds may be, we\nall struggle with the same prob-lems. Be it needing validation\nfrom our peers, being stuck in\na lie that has grown out of\ncontrol, or being in a\nTimDavies relationship that others disprove of.\nMascarades has already garnered a\npositive response from critics, having\nwon \u2018best Arab film\u2019 at the Cairo film\nfestival and \u2018best film\u2019 at the Dubai\nfilm festival. Lyes Salem has shown\nwith his first feature film that he is\none to watch out for, and if you find\nyourself hankering for a bit of World\ncinema during the Oscar season I\u2019d\nadvise you to head on down to the\nCin\u00e9 lumi\u00e9re and check this one out.\nCompetition winners\nCongratulations to James Juillard-Maniece\nand Coranda Berry who won last week\u2019s\ncompetiton.

James, guitarist, is rather tall\nand erratic, but this doesn\u2019t stop his\nethereal sound gracefully blowing an\naudience away.\nThese two songwriters are backed\nup by the solid foundation of Billy and\nLarry on bass and drums. Between\nthem, the group sounds something like\nbeing crushed under a really beautiful\nchandelier.\nFor a label, Asobi Seksu normally\nget slapped with \u201cnu-gaze\u201d. This basically means they are a throwback to\nthe British shoegaze/dream pop bands\nof the 90s (My Bloody Valentine, Cocteau Twins), but they\u2019re more interesting than that. Yuki alternates between\nEnglish and Japanese lyrics or often\nsimply uses her voice as an instrument.\nSinging live she hits every note she did\non record (an impressive feat, despite\nher naturally high range). James sings\na bit as well, but his genius is in his\nmelodic, undulating guitar. It\u2019s surprising that one guy drowned in effects\ncan bring about such a tide of auditory\nsweetness. This is the sound that dominates their performance and sets the\naudience swaying, until they explode\nin feedback and instrumental contor-tion, leaving us to absorb it for a while\nbefore the encore.\nHaving released an acoustic album,\nRewolf, earlier that very day, it\u2019s surprising that they didn\u2019t do any acoustic\ntracks; perhaps a change of pace could\nhave accentuated even further the ex-1.

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009\nFOOD\nFood Editors Chris Sim & Holly Cumbers\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHolly Cumbers explores the origins of our favourite Christmas meal, and recommends a winter-warming drink\nHow our Christmas feast came to fruition\nO\nne of the main things\nabout Christmas is getting together with family and friends to have\na Christmas dinner. I\nthought it would be a nice idea to explore the origins of the Christmas feast.\nThe Christmas feast has been around\nsince the Middle Ages. However it\nwas during the Victorian period that\nthe Christmas feast that we are all so\nfamiliar with was developed- as part of\nthe general transformation of Christmas. For the Victorians, the Christmas\nfeast was the highlight of the day- people weren\u2019t concerned about presents\nbut were really keen to celebrate with\nfriends and family over a large feast.\nAt the end of the nineteenth century\nturkey became a popular Christmas\ndish. Previously, people would opt for\ngoose and beef (just imagine Boxing\nDay without turkey sandwiches!). Apparently people in the North were likely\nto eat beef, whereas people in the South\ntended to eat goose. The main reason\nwhy turkey became so popular was that\nit was a good size so would feed everyone in the family.\nThe plum pudding also has its origins\nin the Victorian period. This was one\nof the greatest rituals of the Christmas\nperiod. It would have been home-made\n- the whole family might have been involved in the great joy of making it - and\nthen hung in a sack for several weeks.\nIt was served by the head of the household who put a sprig of holly on it and\nset it alight - this is really fun and something I suggest you all try at least once\nin your lives. The Victorians even put\nrings, thimbles and coins in the pudding - if you bit into the portion with\nthe ring this meant you would be getting married in the near future, if you\nfound yourself eating a coin it meant\nwealth and if you were lucky enough to\nget the thimble it meant you would remain single. It is a shame that nowadays\nmost Christmas puddings are bought\nfrom a supermarket and just shoved on\nthe table. In addition to the Christmas\npudding there was also a Christmas\ncake and mince pies.\nSo this Christmas when you are tucking into your Christmas feast be sure to\nthink of the many generations who have\nsat around to eat their Christmas din-ner. Long live the Spirit of Christmas!\nOne of my favourite parts of Christmas is drinking mulled wine\neither at home or at a Christmas market. The drink is full of gorgeous Christmas spices and as it is served hot, it really warms\nyou up on a cold winters evening. The drink is also fun to make\nand can make you feel extremely Christmassy.\n1. Into a saucepan mix together 115g sugar, 2 wine glasses of\nwater, 5 cinnamon sticks, a few cloves, ginger and one orange\nzest. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15-20 minutes (stir regu-larly) until it becomes a thick syrup.\n2. Add 1.5l port wine to the mixture and stir. Increase the\ntemperature until the mixture is piping hot but make sure that\nit does not boil.\n3. Then it is ready to be served - how easy is that! Enjoy with\nfriends!\nMulled Wine - enough to make all a tad jolly\nStart here.\nGet there faster.\nOliver Wyman is a leading global management consultancy\nAn equal opportunity employer\nVisit us at oliverwyman.com\nOliver Wyman is a leading global management consultancy.

Never is this clearer\nthan at Christmas; each year I get crap\npresents. I\u2019m sure we all do. Gadgets\nthat break, games that get boring and\niPods that are capable of playing James\nbloody Blunt (it\u2019s the mere fact that at\nsome stage they could go all whiney\nand high pitched that leaves one viewing them with suspicion). The problem\nis this; there\u2019s always so little we really\nneed.\nYet there are so many on this earth\nwho really go without, for whom\nChristmas Day means very little in-deed. 26,000 children will die on the\n25th of December this year of entirely\npreventable diseases. Nothing special\nabout that, of course; the same number\nwill die today, tomorrow and on BoxRory Fenton on his recent teaching experience with some of Kenya\u2019s poorest children on a Catholic mission\nAlthough Kenya is not amongst the poorest countries, poverty still exists\nnow, was I as excited as those children\nwhen they got their one pencil each,\non loan, from mwalim (teacher). They\nwould literally shake with excitement.\nThis was cute, moving perhaps. But it\nwas also wrong.\nChildren shouldn\u2019t be excited by pencils or by paper. They shouldn\u2019t walk naked or half naked around a desert, pulling thorns out of their little feet. They\nshouldn\u2019t die of cholera and diarrhoea\n(1.8 million each and every year). So\nlet\u2019s sort it out. Flood them with pencils\nand paper, wells and vaccinations. Spoil\nthem!\nThis Christmas, consider something\nlike an Oxfam Unwrapped gift, which\nyou can find on Google. Ask for them,\ngive them. Anything from a \u2018School\nBooks\u2019 present for \u00a38 to a whole \u2018School\nLibrary\u2019 for \u00a3400.

Half of the world\u2019s population\nlives on about one pound fifty a day.\nThat certainly doesn\u2019t go far in South\nKensington, and with a family to feed,\nhouse to keep and schools to pay, this\ndoesn\u2019t go all that far in say, Africa\neither.\nI had the privilege of spending a\nmonth last summer with some of the\nworld\u2019s forgotten poor in the north of\nKenya. I couldn\u2019t tell you the average\nincome there, as goats were the main\ncurrency, but what I do know is that if\nit weren\u2019t for the World Food Fund\u2019s\npackages of maize, the people would\nstarve and, even with it, the children\nhave large, malnutrition-induced\nbellies.\nBut even here, some days were special for the children. I carried with\nme a whole tree worth of pencils, as I\nwas to teach at the nursery, and every\nso often the children were allowed to\nuse them (they had to return them, of\ncourse). I doubt in any Christmas that\nI\u2019ve experienced, from as a child up to\nAli is a car mechanic in Lebanon,\nShamsaddin raises cattle on his farm\nin Azerbaijan and Judith owns a catering business in Peru where she cooks\nfor weddings. All three are examples of\nentrepreneurs in a developing country.\nwww.Kiva.org is a website that allows\nyou to support Ali, Shamsaddin, Judith\nand others like them not by donating,\nbut by lending them money.\nThe concept, known as micro-loans,\nis not new ever since Muhammad Yunus set up the Grameen bank in 1983\nto help alleviate poverty in Bangladesh.\nWhat is new and unique about Kiva.\norg is the P2P (person-to-person) connection between the charitable-feeling\nweb surfer and the loan-seeking en-trepreneur. Micro-loans can provide\nhuge economic benefits to a developing or third-world country. This is because they allow local entrepreneurs to\nstart or expand their small businesses,\nwhich in turn may create new jobs or\nnew trading opportunities.\nEntrepreneurs would not otherwise\nhave this utility because \u2018proper\u2019 loans\nfrom a bank demand collateral and a\nbank account, and are only available\nfor far bigger sums. The average loan\nsize entrepreneurs seek through Kiva\nis about $400 (\u00a3240). Sustainability is\nembedded into the concept of micro-loans, as once their business has grown\nand they have repaid the money, the\nindividual entrepreneur has a greater\ncapacity to support themselves and\ntheir family. Relying less on charity like\nfood aid and hand-outs is undoubtedly\nempowering, and there is more satisfaction and dignity in a community\nthat can stand on its own feet.\nKiva.org works directly in the field by\npartnering with local Micro-Finance\nInstitutions (MFIs), organisations that\noperate on the ground, physically disbursing the cash to the entrepreneur,\nand collecting payments according\nto an agreed schedule. Kiva.org carefully selects these field partners to ensure they are trustworthy and reliable.\nMoreover micro-loans have a benevolent nature. Most MFIs are non-profit\norganisations whose raison d\u2019etre is\nusually community development or\ncreating employment opportunities,\nunlike banks which lend money with\nthe primary purpose of making a prof-it. Every month Kiva.org posts up the\nprofiles of new entrepreneurs seeking\nloans using information they receive\nfrom the MFIs. Web surfers can select entrepreneurs they wish to support and lend them $25 (roughly \u00a316\nat current exchange rates) or higher.\nThus several lenders from Kiva.org\u2019s\nonline community of over half-a-mil-lion users will contribute to a loan. Of\ncourse the risk associated with lending\nmoney, that the borrower cannot repay fully, can never be eliminated, but\nthe repayment rate of all loans made\nthrough Kiva.org is roughly 98%.\nThe MFI already agrees a repayment schedule beforehand with the\nentrepreneur, which usually consists of\nmonthly payments over a period of a\nyear or longer. However one criticism\nlevelled on Kiva.org is the high interest\nrates entrepreneurs that are charged by\nthe field partners, often 30% or 35% on\nthe original loan sum. Kiva.org justifies this by explaining that the nature\nof micro-lending is expensive. A high-Kiva.org co-founder Jessica Flannery with one of many entrepreneur recipients of the website\u2019s microfinancing support\nstreet bank in Britain can simply process forms and transfer sums between\nbank accounts for say a \u00a310,000 business loan, while an MFI must have\nstaff walking on foot to disburse and\ncollect a \u00a3200 loan for a farmer in a\nremote village. Another criticism of\nKiva.org is its decision in June 2009 to\nprovide loans to US-based entrepre-neurs, as the credit crunch has made\ntimes tough for American small business owners.\nMany in Kiva.org\u2019s online community have not welcomed this, arguing\nthat a poor loan-seeking individual in\nthe USA is still significantly better off\nthan one in a developing country. Others argue that if a micro-loan can assist\nsomeone in their life, it shouldn\u2019t matter whether the beneficiary is in the\nUSA or any other country.\nAs the entrepreneur makes their re-payments, the web surfer will receive\ntheir money back; this of course is\nthe difference between Kiva.org and\nnormal charities. The generous web\nsurfer has the option of re-lending to\nanother entrepreneur. This begs the\nquestion: Which is more effective at\nalleviating poverty?\nMaking a \u00a3100 one-off donation, or\nconstantly re-lending a \u00a3100 sum to\nseveral entrepreneurs? While any economic analysis of this question would\nbe a statistical nightmare, it can at least\nbe said that each form of generosity\nhas its place. Either way you are making a sacrifice out of your own good\nwill, namely losing the ability to spend\nyour \u00a3100.\nSince its launch in 2005 Kiva.org has\nfast gained popularity in true Web 2.0\nfashion by tapping into the masses. Its\nco-founders Matt & Jessica Flannery\nestablished the website as a U.S.501(c)3\nnon-profit organization, the US equivalent of being a registered charity,\nbut their online community extends\nfar beyond just the US. They\u2019ve managed to gain the support of several\norganisations including PayPal, which\nhas agreed not to charge a fee when\nprocessing payments to and from Kiva.\norg, making it the first organisation to\nbenefit from this exemption.\nOne definition of philanthropy is the\n\u201cactive effort to promote human welfare\u201d, and it comes from the two Greek\nwords that make it up -philos (loving)\nand anthropos (humankind). There is\nno one size fits all when it comes to\nhuman beings committing charitable\nor selfless acts, and for many generous\nweb surfers who have joined the Kiva.\norg online community, lending is the\nnew giving.\nAn alternative to cash aid-loans to spark enterprise\nHassan Joudi\nHassan Joudi\n\n"

    "content": "6\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor Ravi Pall\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009\nI\nt may have come to your attention that in the last month\nsomething rather unique hap-pened. I am not referring to the\nrather wonderful weather but\nthe appointment of two \u2018unknowns\u2019\nas the president and high representative of the EU. Appointment rather\nthan election as no votes were cast? I\nalways thought voting was the positive\ncontrol for polling. What has struck\nme though in the last few weeks and\nindeed the run up to this whole event\nhas been the media interest in it all.\nThe need to whirl up some news and\nfill the never ending comment pages of\nthe internet blogs and opinion pages\nhas lead many to musing on the possible candidates for these positions.\nOnce again it is interesting that anytime there is anything to do with anyone being chosen the media seem to\ndesignate a favourites list and give us\na 5 line biography for each one of the\nsupposed chosen ones. Of course even\nfrom the start of such articles it is never left to your own thoughts who might\nbe the current favourite. Journalists\ntend to give us halfwits a rather clear\ntip as to who the favourite is. Usually\nit is something along the lines of \u2018The\nfrontrunner\u2019 or score system. Gold\nstars are my preferred rating system.\nYou always seem to know where you\nare with a gold star. The fact that none\nof you or me had any influence on the\nwhole selection process just adds to\nthe need to rate them in the first place.\nIt is a warm and safe feeling knowing\nthat the guy with 5 gold stars who was\n\u2018The frontrunner\u2019 got the job. It keeps\norder in the world, whichever one you\nmay currently reside in.\nThe true interest this time round\nhowever lies not in telling you who\nmight actually be getting the post\nbut rather the fact that we, otherwise\nknown as the Great British People,\nhave a good chance of getting one of\nour own in on the job. Some guy called\nTony apparently. Not sure if you have\nheard of him but the rest of Europe\nseem to. In any case Tony did not get\nto be president which is probably what\nhe wanted from the start. What is surprising is the fact that a large number\nof people in this country seem to feel\nthat despite being more Eurosceptic\nthan the average Russian ultranation-alist, we should have one of our own\nin one of the new posts created by the\nLisbon Treaty. The same country that\nseems to revile the thought of the evil\nBrussels bureaucratic monster that\nstraightens our cucumbers and hides\nour Victorian light bulbs is all too\nready to assume right and claim the\nmost senior post created by a treaty\nmost of us have not actually read or\nunderstood beyond the words United\nStates of Europe. This expectancy is\nboth intriguing and quite frankly utterly strange. Why chase the position\nthat your people do not seem to appre-ciate, be interested in or even properly\nunderstand?\nIn the end Armageddon, or in European terms, having to waste a perfectly\ngood dinner deciding who should get\nwhich job, was averted by as it now\nseems a decision making process that\ninvolved eliminating the obvious candidates and plumping for the ones\nthat would have the least impact in\nthe job. Most people have never heard\nof the new president and high repre-sentative. That is most British people.\nI would like to assume most Belgians\nhave heard of their soon to be ex prime\nminister. Maybe not, after all politicians do seem to be both expendable\nand infinite. But we still got one of the\npositions. Except it seems because our\nwinner, I mean, appointee, is not some\nkind of political celebrity it was a bit of\na waste. Shame, I am sure we were all\nlooking forward to some Euro glitz. It\nwill have to wait I guess.\nAs the week has gone on though it\nseems that the esteemed forces that\ngovern us, astrology aside, have already decided that the presidents job\nspecification is vacant. and therefore\nhe will be a simple ornament and the\nhigh representative is the true one with\nall the power. Time for a quick change\nof tact. Lets all swing behind the High\nRepresentative (I have even heard she\nis British!) Oh but it seems she cannot\ncope with the job. Something about\nnot having a clue about what the job is\nor how to actually do it apparently is\nnot attractive.\nIn this way it comes to bear that the\nfinal and most lasting piece of this\nwhole affair has been the choice of\ntwo people who are capable of many\nthings but will get license to do none.\nA fine dinner here, a great conference\nthere but at the end of the day the people calling the shots, making the cars\nstop and having the real say are not the\ntwo appointed ones but the 27 elected\nones. So it is back to square one, only\nthis time there are some people in this\nfar away magic land called Brussels,\nwhich can be blamed for even more\nof our own elected politicians failures\nand misdemeanours. I sense some Euroscepticism coming on\u2026\nAndreas Hadjivasiliou odds were good\n\u201cMost people\nhave never\nheard of the new\npresident... That\nis most British\npeople\u201d\nHoneymoon period?\nThere wasn\u2019t one\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\nA\nll I bloody hear is the\nclock ticking. We all\nknow what that sounds\nlike, and we all know\nwhat the stabbing sounds\nof each second, \u2018tick\u2019 or \u2018tock\u2019, means.\nTime is slipping away, and there\u2019s just\nabout nothing we can do to stop it\n(short from building a DeLorean and\ntaking a joyride with Marty McFly).\nA third of my time as Editor has meandered by and well, the realisation has\nupset me. When the first issue of the\nyear came out, I was happily wearing\na wife-beater outside and complaining\nto the Union that the air conditioning\ndown in the felix office was on the blink.\nThis week I wore five different layers to\nkeep warm, and now I\u2019m complaining\nthat the heating\u2019s on the blink. Winter\nmakes me moody, and since I\u2019m unduly\nmissing even more daylight (well, technically not because there\u2019s actually less\nof it in winter months, but we\u2019ll let that\nslip), I have every reason to be.\nDon\u2019t fret though, everything in between those wife-beater-wearing days\nand now have been wonderful. We\u2019ve\nreleased and published 11 issues, each\nof which struck a new chord of delight\nin my brain, and hopefully yours too.\nI\u2019ve managed to turn unwelcoming\npanic, circa. early October, into a stressful confidence that allows the paper to\ngo to print on time each week.\nAside from a Fresher being mugged\nstraight after the Mingle (the poor little thing), our first big story was that\nthe Faculty Unions had lost an unfunny\nball-sack load of money on their formal\nfirst term events. On the backdrop of\nthis, we exposed the first cracks in the\nCity and Guilds College Union; internal\nsquabbling ensued in public, and even\nmore so in private I\u2019d assume.\nTheir committee got themselves into\na bit of a jumble, and a united front\nwas the last thing anyone saw. Even in\nCouncil meetings, their senior committee members were arguing with each\nother across the room. I tried to stifle\nmy bad case of I-told-you-so coughs,\nbut I just couldn\u2019t.\nWith the news this week that their\nPresident, Kirsty Patterson, is stepping\ndown at the end of term due to academic and registration reasons, it is safe\nto say there is relief within the Guilds\ncamp. Not explicitly because she is leav-ing, but because of the fiascos that her\ntime in office has seen. A new leader\nis on the horizon, and my bets are on\nRikki Norris. He\u2019s settled nicely in the\nUnion this term, and I feel he\u2019ll jump\nat the chance to put Kirsty\u2019s debatable\nwrongs right.\nHowever, as a proud Scientist, I am\nglad to see the return of mascotry,\neven if it did involve the solid blame\nlaid upon me for losing about a third\nof Theta, the Royal College of Science\u2019s\n86kg metal mascot.\nTalking of exiting leaders, Sir Roy Anderson, The Rector, announcing his resignation really sent the office into over-drive. The sudden announcement and\nsurrounding hearsay gave the impression there was something more than\nwhat the College and Sir Roy presented\nto us. Something is certainly rotten in\nthe state of Imperial College.\nThey may think we\u2019re foolish enough\nto believe their reasons at face-value,\nbut I believe that the staff and students\ndeserve the full story. Hopefully, by the\nend of the year, we shall have exactly\nthat. No promises though; College are\nunderstandably tight-lipped about the\nissue.\nOnto less suspicious happenings;\nfelix celebrated its 60th anniversary.\nThe team compiled a special celebratory issue and special thanks must go\nto Carlos Karingal, our Layout Editor\nfor producing the spectacular wrap\nthat was a modified reproduction of\nthe very first issue of felix. We also had\na (rather drunken) dinner where we\nunited thirteen past editors in the Union Dining Hall. Ex-felix Editor Pallab\nGhosh entertained us with an after-dinner speech alongside ex-felix writer\nSimon Singh.\nIt was a lovely end to this term, and\nI\u2019ve got Christmas and New Year\u2019s\nto look forward to. I will be leaving\nLondon for the first time in about\nsix months and will be rocking up\nthe pubs of Dublin, Eastbourne, and\nLeeds. Desperation sets in when your\nonly escape from Central London is\nthe mouldy M25-shouldered town of\nWatford.\nMy three \u2018holiday\u2019 destinations are\nhardly exotic either, but you try cruising the Carribean on a salary you\u2019ve effectively pumped entirely back behind\nthe Union bar.\n\u201cI believe that the staff\nand students deserve the\nfull story. Hopefully, by\nthe end of the year, we\nshall have exactly that.\u201d\n\n"

The entire Riding and Polo Club committee combined in a\nmassive effort to give a\nFREE polo trial to ANYONE that fancied a go, even those who had never\nridden a horse, and they say polo is an\nelitist sport\u2026\nThe list was made, the food was\nwaiting at the club (vegetarian option included) and the horses (and\nour kindly manager and coach Ollie\nBrowne) were up and ready to go by\nsunrise. As we made our way to meet\nat the Union I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t alone\nin casting an apprehensive look at the\nsky \u2013 DROP. Drop, drop, drop, drop.\nPerfect \u2013 it started raining. I thought\nto myself \u201cIt\u2019s OK, the people will have\nleft their houses by now, there\u2019d be no\npoint turning back for a few drops of\nrain\u201d. Luckily I got to the Union just\nin time to avoid the torrential showers that seemed to be engulfing South\nKen, and the rest of London including\nBelmont Polo Club, our venue in Mill\nHill at the end of Northern line.\nSurprisingly enough about 2/3 of the\npeople that had signed up arrived! As\nwe waited, the waters calmed and the\nrain settled in time for us to head for\nthe tube. I should have known that\nwe\u2019d lose recruits \u2013 the rain and the\nidea of muddy fields could have put\nthem off a tad, who knows. Seemingly,\napart from a couple of fallen pawns,\nthe battle was not lost and we appeared\nto be doing fairly well. Had I believed\nin destiny, I would have known that\nwhat was about to happen could only\nhave been fate. The driver makes an\nannouncement: \u201cThis train has been\ndiverted due to signal failure: it will\nnot be going to Mill Hill East anymore\u201d.\nUGH! Alright change train, quick. We\ndo, but our powers, and those of TfL,\nwere nothing to those of the weather \u2013\nall we could do was take a bus. All take\nout their iPhones, Blackberries, Nokia\nE71s, ANYTHING to look for an alternative route on the dreaded buses. We\nfound one \u2013 it added an hour and a half\nto the expected journey time, with two\nbuses \u2013 the second we JUST missed.\nInjured and scarred we arrived victorious at our final destination \u2013 Belmont Polo Club. The lucky few that\nhad left before us or made their own\nway via alternative routes were casually riding on their ponies, happily holding a mallet and swinging it in the air\nas Ollie, Jon Matthews and Alex Savell\npainstakingly explained the art of the\ngame. Jon Matthews, one of the club\u2019s\ntop polo fanatics comments, \u201cThe arena was quite a sight with six people on\nhorses and sixteen people being taught\nthe basics of the polo swing on foot.\u201d\nThe much-needed BBQ courtesy of\nBelmont was up and running and the\nArgentine beer was proving a great\nsuccess. Even though we got there so\nlate, everyone got a go on a horse, everyone (or a good part) loved it and to\nadd the cherry on the cake, the sun even\nstarted shining.\nPolo is one of the most dangerous,\nhigh-adrenaline sports in the world.\nThe rush you get from playing and the\npure excitement of the game outweigh\nthe risks, which in the end add to the\nexperience, leaving you with a semi-permanent natural high many hours after you\u2019ve played. Am I claiming polo is\nlike a drug? Yes indeed. It\u2019s addictive, it\u2019s\nfast, it\u2019s fun and it promotes a beautiful\nbond between two species: humans and\nhorses. These join forces to outcompete\ntheir opponenents in the game. The\nhorse in fact, counts for 70% of the skill\nof the game. Polo ponies are amongst\nthe most beautiful and well-kept horses\nin the world. They\u2019re powerful, slender,\nagile, and exhibit impressive displays of\nacceleration and manoeuvrability. They\ncan stop , turn and go with such rapidity and grace the human is left looking\nrather demeaned. Their responsiveness\nto commands leaves you in awe of them,\nand it doesn\u2019t take long to tune in with\ntheir mind \u2013 they want to play as much\nas you do, and enjoy it as much as you\ndo. It takes a bit of time, but after the\nhorse and the player share a common\nobjective \u2013 there is no power that will\nstop them. To tell the truth, most of the\ntime the pony plays a lot better than I\ndo (amusing really). But once you try\nit, you don\u2019t want to stop, and though it\ntakes a lot patience and practice to master a sport (in polo\u2019s case also quite a bit\nof money) I am prepared to sacrifice it\nall just so I can play. Fortunately for me,\npolo at Imperial isn\u2019t that expensive:\nprobably one of the best deals in town.\nInterested in joining?

We\nwill also attend talks/invite speakers\ntalking about topical issues of interest related to Ukraine, and encourage discussions between our society\u2019s\nmembers.\nWe are composed of Ukrainians,\nthose with Ukrainian roots and other\nSlavic and non-Slavic people interested\nin our culture. We are open to anyone\nwishing to learn more about Ukraine,\nits history, politics, economical issues,\nlanguage and traditions, and anything\nelse related to it. We will consider any\nsuggestions of possible events to or-ganize, and as long as there are enough\nenthusiasts, it should be possible to arrange them. We will also try to provide\nsupport to our members in terms of\nUK visa information and job applica-tions. Furthermore, we would assist\nthose wishing to apply to Imperial\nCollege, as representatives of it in our\nhome country.\nWe are going to work together with\nother UK university Ukrainian Societies and the Association of Ukrainians\nin the UK to organize joint themed\nevents.

He stands to lose a small\nfortune if the final verdict does not go\nhis way.\n\u201cThe decision could go either way. We\nare still only arguing about the meaning of the article, so we remain a long\nway from the trial itself and settling the\nwhole matter. I suspect that this libel\nbattle could continue for at least another year,\u201d he told felix.\nThough, even if the final verdict falls\nin his favour, he himself admits in cases\nsuch as his, he is likely to lose a substantial amount of money anyway.\nIn this way, scientists and journalists\nhave argued that current libel laws in\nEngland and Wales are severely stifling\nthe advancement of scientific debate\nand free speech. In a case with two sides\nto the argument (as in the majority of\nscientific or medical discussions), English libel laws have been heavily criticised for encouraging the accused side\nof responding with defamation or slander lawsuit claims, rather than putting\ntheir own argument beyond reproach\nwith relevant scientific evidence.\nThe formation of the working group,\nled by Justice Secretary Jack Straw, was\nannounced in the House of Lords. Jack\nStraw called the current laws of which\nSimon Singh is suffering \u201cunbalanced\u201d\nand in need of a \u201cradical change\u201d, whilst\nfreedom of speech campaigners are\nlobbying firm proposals for the upcoming reforms in English libel laws.\nScience-specialised journalist, TV\nproducer and author Simon Singh fell\nvictim to the ill-balanced libel laws in\nApril 2008 when he published an article on the Guardian website called\n\u201cBeware the spinal trap.\u201d The article\nwas in response to Chiropractic Awareness Week 2008, and condemned the\n(BCA) for promoting treatments that\nhe claimed were \u201cbogus\u201d\n.\nThough he freely admitted chiropractic treatment can help cure localised\nback problems, he stated there \u201cis not a\njot of evidence\u201d for the efficacy of chiropractic treatment with colic, sleeping\nand feeding problems, frequent ear in-fections, asthma and prolonged crying.\nSubsequently, the BCA filed for libel\nagainst Singh, and contended that his\ncomments on the national newspaper\u2019s website have \u201cseriously injured its\ncredit and reputation\u201d. The BCA made\nit clear that they are seeking damages\nfrom Singh personally, and not from\nthe Guardian.\nThough The Guardian initially\nbacked Singh\u2019s case as the publisher of\nhis article, they soon pulled out to leave\nSingh standing in the courts alone.\nOn Sense for Science\u2019s (a charitable\ntrust that promotes fair and balanced\ndebate in science) website, Singh reasoned with The Guardian\u2019s decision.\n\u201cTo a large extent I understand The\nGuardian\u2019s position and its decision,\u201d he\nstated. However, critics of English libel\nlaws claim it is not a situation journalists and authors should have to swallow.\nMedia groups, as well as individuals\ndefending libel claims, can lose six-fig-ure sums in covering legal costs alone.\n\u201cNo win no fee\u201d rulings are to blame,\nputting the losing side heavily into the\nred. Simon Singh has reportedly already\nhad to find \u00a3100,000 to just unsuccessfully defend himself in front of Judge\nDavid Eady, the UK\u2019s leading judge on\nlibel and slander issues, in a preliminary\nhearing at the Courts of Justice in May\n2009. The damages awarded to the successful party in such a case as the BCA\nvs. Simon Singh can easily be dwarfed\nby the legal costs incurred of running\nthe trial. Singh, amongst many others,\nworries these costs are stifling ability to\ndefend respectable work.\nHe said: \u201cThe current libel laws force\nmany academics and writers to back\ndown on matters that they believe to\nbe accurate; this is simply because they\ndo not have the funds to back their be-liefs. Free speech should not depend\non whether or not someone is rich or\npowerful.\u201d\nDuring felix\u2019s 60th anniversary celebratory dinner, in which Singh was a\nguest speaker, he endorsed charities\ndedicating support to fair journalistic freedom of speech, namely English\nPen, a British-based international charity that backs persecuted writers. Together with Index on Censorship, an\nanti-censorship charity, English Pen has\nreleased a report outlining suggestions\nfor the Government\u2019s reform working\ngroup that is expected to produce the\nmajority of its fruits within the next\ncouple of months.\nThe report directly relates to the financial imbalance in libel action. They\nsuggest a cap of \u00a310,000 on libel pay-outs, and drastically minimising legal\ncosts incurred by the losing party. They\nalso suggest a shift of the burden of\nproof to the claimant. The claimant, the\nBCA in Singh\u2019s case, would first have to\nactually prove that Singh\u2019s comments\nhad \u201cdefamed\u201d their reputation before\nthe hearing could continue. It would\neffectively add an extra layer of protection on the accused, and a fairer trial\nthat would mean both sides of the claim\nwould have to prove something.\nThe campaigners are also pushing reforms to prevent \u201clibel tourism\u201d; Singh\nalso drew attention to this issue during\nhis short speech this weekend. Current\nEnglish libel laws are poorly designed\nso that they allow any publication distributed in the UK to be subject to libel\naction under English courts, and not\nthe courts of the publication\u2019s origin.\nAmerican newspapers have threatened\nto stop their limited circulation in London if the native libel laws continue to\nso heavily favour libel action against\nthem.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t act we\u2019re at risk of becoming a global pariah. There are US States\nwho view English libel law as so damaging to free speech they have passed\nlaws to effectively block the decisions of\nEnglish judge,\u201d said John Kampfner, the\nCEO of Index on Censorship.\nSingh continues to show his unequivocal support for libel reform and\nthe parallel lobbying of proposals.\n\u201cLibel reform is now an active issue\nthe politicians are willing to listen and\nit up to the public to make enough\nnoise to move the issue up the political\nagenda,\u201d he said to felix.\nThere is an air of poignancy as Singh\nreturns to Blackett Lab\u2019s Lecture Theatre 1, where he was taught the scientific disciplines he defends today, to\npresent a guest lecture to Imperial\nstudents about his own case and most\nimportantly its wider meaning for the\nEnglish legal fields on Monday 14th\nDecember. He stressed the importance of these issues to both current\nand future scientists.\n\u201cI want to explain what is wrong with\nEnglish libel laws and then address any\ndoubts that people might have about\nwhether or not reform is necessary. I\nam keen that as many people as possible at Imperial sign the petition for libel reform. As they stand, the libel laws\nrestrict scientific debate, so reforming\nthe libel laws should be an important\nissue for both staff and students.\u201d\nThe long and winding road to libel reform\n19 April 2008 -Simon Singh writes\nan article in the\nGuardian questioning\nthe legitimacy of\nchiropractic treatment.\nThis resulted in the\nBritish Chiropractic\nAssociation suing him\nfor libel. The Guardian\nstands by him and covers\nthe cost of the lengthy\nlawsuit.\n7 May 2009 -Preliminary hearing takes\nplace in the Royal Courts\nof Justice, the judge holds\nthat Singh\u2019s article accuses\nthe BCA of knowingly\nbeing dishonest.\nSingh denies this\ninterpretation and points\nout that his case is now\nvery difficult to fight.\n14 October 2009\nSingh is allowed leave\nto give him time to\nappeal. Speculation is\ngenerating as to how\nthis will affect the right\nof freedom of speech in\ncritising alternative.\n29 November 2009\n20,000 people have\nsigned a petition\nstarted by the charity\n\u2018Sense about Science\u2019\nwho issued the\nfollowing statement;\n\u201cThe English law of\nlibel has no place in\nscientific disputes\nabout evidence.\u201d\n14 December 2009\nSimon Singh comes\nback to Imperial\nCollege, where he\nstudied, to give a talk\nabout his case and the\nsurrounding issues.\nfelix and the Royal College of Science Union proudly present:\nSimon Singh with a lecture on\nScience and the Battle for Free Speech\n6pm, Monday 14th December\nLecture Theatre 1, Blackett Building\nFREE (Imperial ID for priority seating)\nR.C.S.\nr 2009\nhave\non\nKatya-yani\nVyas\n\n"

    "content": "12\nPOLITICS\nPolitics Editors James Goldsack, Katya-yani Vyas, James Lees and Phil Murray\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009\nCopenhagen\nConference\nO\nn December 7th began the 11-day 15th\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference, held in the Danish\ncapital, Copenhagen. Although, if that\ncomes as news to you, where have you\nbeen for the last few months!\nThis has been in the press since\nMarch, when the UN Climate Science\nConference was held for current global research into climate change to be\nshared and presented to the decision\nmakers.\nSince then, news of the \u2018run up\u2019 to\nCopenhagen has grown, and in the last\nfew weeks there has been a torrent of\nstories, with many, unfortunately, not\nlooking at the climate issues at all, but\non rumour and slander, which will only\nmake those undecided upon whether\nclimate change is happening more\nsceptical.\nThe media has a duty to educate the\npublic into the matters that will affect\ntheir lives.\nThis is possibly going to be the most\nvital decision to our future ever made,\nand the public need to know what\u2019s\ngoing on, with accuracy, to be able to\npressure their government into making the right decisions. The media has\nfailed in this respect.\nTrying to find a news story explaining exactly what is being debated is like\ntrying to find a needle in a haystack.\nInstead are \u2018Climategate\u2019 stories \u2013 spin\non hacking at East Anglia Climatic Research Unit, and the like.\nI guess here at Imperial, we are open-minded enough to listen and think\nthrough media bullshit to believe that\nclimate change is happening, whether\nit be due to Nature, Man or a mixture of both. But whatever the cause,\nwe\u2019re in trouble and we have to sort\nthis out. Lets hope so anyway. Although at times I do wonder\u2026 Outside\nthese walls is a wide world, where that\ndoesn\u2019t always happen.\nOn Tuesday 8th, I attended a lecture / debate at the Royal Society of\nChemistry titled \u2018Chemistry, Energy\n& Climate Change\u2019. I won\u2019t go into the\npresentation as I\u2019m sure you can guess\nits contents, but what sticks in my\nmind is that during the debate after the\nlecture, someone asked, and I quote,\n\u201cThere was a time, before oil was laid\ndown millions of years ago, that all that\ncarbon was in the atmosphere. What\u2019s\nwrong with putting it back there?\u201d\nFail.\nNow, this being the RSC, he was\nlaughed at, but in the general public,\nthis kind of thing is quite common,\nwith something like half of the public still unsure about whether climate\nchange is happening and whether we\nneed to be worrying about it. Scary\nthat, isn\u2019t it\u2026\nThis conference is the political fol-low-up to the science conference back\nin March. We scientists have armed the\npoliticians with the information necessary to save the world; now we need to\nsee if they actually will. The decisions\nthey need to make will be hard and un-popular, but taking the popular, easy\nway out will be catastrophic.\nThe main aim of the conference is to\nagree to a global cut in greenhouse gas\nemissions, chief among which is CO2\n.\nBy how much, is the key issue. There is\na lot of optimism going into the confer-ence, with big pledges from countries\non their intended cuts. The EU pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions by\n20%, by 2020, the emissions of 1990\nlevels. Japan by 25%. Australia by 25%,\nfrom 2000 emissions levels.\nInterestingly, the United States of\nAmerica has put forward some of the\nbiggest pledges of all. The US did not\nsign up to the Kyoto Protocol back in\n1997 at the 5th UN Climate Change\nConference, the agreement to cut\nemissions by 5.2% by 2012, those of\n1990 levels. Without the US, who in\n1990 were responsible for 36% of global CO2\nemissions, the Kyoto Protocol\nwas a bit pointless, even though the results are promising.\nNow, the US is pledging a 17% reduction by 2020, a 42% reduction by 2030\n& an 83% reduction by 2050! That\nis truly incredible. Let\u2019s be honest,\nObama is a dude!\nOne of the main stumbling blocks\nhas been that developing countries\nargue that development is a very en-ergy-intensive, and therefore emissive,\nprocess.\nDeveloped countries have been allowed to say \u2018to hell with emissions\u2019\nin the face of development in the past,\nwhy now, when it is our turn, are we\nnot allowed to? That\u2019s a fair comment I think, but those leaders have\nto be mature enough to realise that\nthe world has changed, and that is no\nlonger possible.\nBut there is promise in this field too,\nas India & China both pledge 20% &\n40% cuts respectively in greenhouse\ngas emissions by 2020, from 2005\nlevels.\nThe conference finishes on December 18th. Keep a keen eye on the press\nthat day. Wade through all the crap\nand find out what has been decided.\nBecause that decision will affect your\nlife, your children\u2019s lives, and every following generation.\nWe know now that, whatever is decided in the next week, we will be cutting emissions, and we will have to\nchange the way we live. Realise that we\nhave no other choice. How much we\nchange, we find out then. How much\nwe need to change, I am guessing, is\nmore that what is going to be changed.\nBut then these are politicians we are\ntalking about\u2026\nAnyway, all that is left to be said in\nthis final issue of the year is Happy\nChristmas, and a Wonderful New Year.\nFor those of you with exams next term,\nand, being Imperial, that\u2019s most of us,\nthe very best of luck.\nPhilMurray Politics Editor\nJames Goldsack\nThink Tanks should think more\nJames Lees\nPolitical Christmas\nScottish First Minister Alex Salmond,\nLeader of the SNP, has been accused\nof politicising Christmas.\nHe has revealed his Christmas card\nfor 2009 which features a picture entitled \u201cA New Journey\u201d by Scottish artist Gerard Burns, portraying a young\ngirl carrying a Saltire (Scottish) flag,\nlooking over a winter scene.\nMr Salmond described the image\nas \u201can enchanting and evocative image by a talented artist\u201d and added\nthat \u201cthe proceeds from the sale of the\ncanvas will be shared equally between\nfour extremely worthwhile charities,\nCLIC Sargent, Glasgow the Caring\nCity, J-A-C-K Foundation and Mary\u2019s\nMeals.\u201d\nOpposition MSPs have accused Mr\nSalmond of politicising Christmas by\nusing the Saltire in his card.\nScottish Conservative chief whip\nDavidMcLetchieaccusedMrSalmond\nof being \u201cblind\u201d to reality and having\nan obsession with independence.\n\u201cFor the overwhelming majority of Scots, Alex Salmond\u2019s so-called\n\u2018journey to independence\u2019 is a road to\nnowhere.\u201d\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats\nhave also criticised the card with the\nparty\u2019s chief whip, Mike Rumbles,\nThe think tank Demos has called on\nthe government to bring into action a\n\u2018civic service\u2019. The idea is that people\nwould be obliged to perform work otherwise thought of as voluntary work\nsuch as being a community support\nofficer.\nThe scheme would be aimed at\nyoung people, 18-24 year olds, both\nthose at university and at work or unemployed with the aim of making us all\nmore employable and building a sense\nof national altruism.\nDemos estimated the scheme would\ncost \u00a3450m and could be payed for by\nincreasing the interest rate on student\nloans. So not only does this \u2018think tank\u2019\nbelieve we should be forced to do voluntary work, we should also be paying\nfor the privilege.\nNot only is this outrageous on princi-ple, it also makes no sense whatsoever\nfinancially. The justification for passing the cost of the scheme onto graduates is that Demos have randomly\ndecided that graduates earn \u00a3600,000\nmore over their lifetime than someone\nwith 2 A-levels.\nThis is just wrong. Until recently\nthe government believed that a graduate could expect to earn in the region\nof \u00a3400,000 more over the course of\na lifetime. This figure has since been\nrevised following a report from Lord\nBrowne to a figure much closer to\n\u00a3100,000, this report having been commissioned as part of an investigation\ninto the state of higher education since\nthe instigation of tuition fees.\nAnother \u2018highlight\u2019 of the think tank\u2019s\nreport was the idea that young people\nwho have not gone to university should\nbe able to take on loans at the favourable rates we recieve, though of course\nthey are also required to perform the\n100 hours of community service.\nIn the report, Demos have also suggested that companies would be forced\nto allow workers a week off to perform\nthe same kind of voluntary work. The\nreport sounds as if it is set on ruining\nour economy, filling us all with nationalist pride and making everyone feel\nequal. I suspect a Marxist plot.\nPolitics Editor\nPolitics Editor adding: \u201c\u201cI\u2019m sure people would be\nmore impressed if the first minister had\nthought about the message of Christmas rather than spent time picking out\nthe most nationalistic Christmas card\nhe could find\u201d.\nA spokesman for the First Minister\ndismissed the attacks on the Christmas card from \u201cparty poopers\u201d, say-ing: \u201cMessrs McLetchie and Rumbles\nshould lighten up and get with the\nChristmas spirit. They are obviously\nbadly in need of a festive break\u201d.\nThe Christmas card in question\nForced labour camps may become part and parcel of being a student in the United Kingdom if these plans go ahead\n\n"

Each win grants you\n5 points, 2 for a draw and you suffer a\npenalty of 4 points for every loss you\nconcede. Some would say the reason\nsome teams exist at Imperial is to attain as high a position as possible in\nthe infamous felixSport League Table.\nTo extrapolate this view, we are providing an incentive for you to play all\nyour games and are thus now enabling\nwalkovers to contribute to the table, at\nthe end of the season. So no slacking\nguys and girls. This is BUCS after all\nThough Tennis Men\u2019s 1sts cannot\nreplicate last year\u2019s success of winning\nall their games, can they top this year\u2019s\ntable? After Rugby Men\u2019s 1sts horrid season with the cream of the crop\nin the BUCS South Premiership B,\nthey are once again topping the tables\nwith an impressive 7 victories from 8\ngames. The Medicals will aim to improve on last year and by this year-end\nthey occupy 3 of the top 10 spots. In\ncontrast they do occupy 6 of the bottom 10 places.\nHave fun reading and debating with\nyour friends from rival sports and\nteams and please ensure you get your\nresults to fixtures live or Alissa Ayling,\nthe Sports Partnership Administrator\nup in the SAC as soon as you can after\nyour games so we can have an as up to\ndate table as possible. Stay winning all!\nEnthralling Encounter between College and Medics\ngiving a goal after the Medicals centre\nback climbed over the College centre\nback and new boy David Sapin.\nFrom then on, College controlled\n80% of the possession of the game and\nhad several half chances that were dealt\nwith confidently by the solid back four\nof the Medicals. Strong play on the left\nby both Theocharis Tofis and Matthieu\nVallin caused moments of uncertainty\namongst the Medicals back line but\nwere eventually dealt with.\nGoing into half time 1-nil down,\nBotchway delivered a team talk that\nsummarised that the previous half as\n\u2018frankly not good enough\u2019 and though\nthey had the upper hand in technical\nability, \u2018the medics want it more and\ndeserve to be winning\u2019.\nAfter three big wins in BUCS, a\ndisappointing 1-0 loss against King\u2019s\nMedicals 1st XI; a team who had\nachieved zero points until then, the\nprevious week, had piled on the pressure to Imperial\u2019s 1st XI who now must\nachieve maximum points to stay in\ncontention in the ULU league.\nThe second half was much of the\nsame, with College dominating possessing and probing the final third.\nThe pressure on the Medicals finally\ndefeated them after a strongly hit free\nkick by Leslie Eshun ricocheted off\nmany players and fortunately fell to\nMatthieu Vallin who stabbed it home\nto bring his tally to 4 this season.\nCollege, with even more momentum\nthan before knocked on the door many\ntimes but though demoralised, the\nMedicals\u2019 defence was impermeable.\nEx College player Karim Amer controlled the tempo of the game when\nhe had the ball, causing panic amongst\nCollege\u2019s players who dove in recklessly creating space for Amer to feed\nin the Medicals strikers. This almost\nwas rewarded with a goal after the\nMedicals striker beat the offside trap\nto place a stinging shot, which brought\na fingertip, save from Botchway.\n1-a-piece at full-time and with light\nquickly fading, the referee decided to\nplay an extra time with two periods of\n5 minutes. The Medicals almost got\nthe winner in the first half of extra time\nafter again the Medicals striker utilised\nthe absence of linsemen as well the\nhigh defensive line of College to race\nthrough, only to put his shot over.\nThe best chance of the match came\nin the second half of extra time where\ncentral midfielder Dion Benincasa delivered a cross field ball to Vallin who\nthen crossed it in the box for Nathan\nFerrol to flick it onto Eshun who unluckily put it wide after being put\nthrough one-on-one with the Medicals\nkeeper.\nImmortals yet to win with heavy\nloss to Brighton Tsunamis\nThe Imperial Immortals hit the road\nagain on Sunday for their third game of\nthe season, trekking to the south coast\nto face an experienced Brighton side.\nBattling a bigger squad and at times\nthe elements, the injury-hit Immortals\npersevered bravely with a threadbare\nsquad of nineteen, but were unable to\nprevent a Tsunami victory.\nMustapher Botchway Sports editor\nfelixSports League\nTeam P W D L F A Diff felixSport\nIndex\n1 Volleyball Men's 1st 5 5 0 0 10 2 8 5.00\n2 Fencing Women's 1st 4 4 0 0 529 353 176 5.00\n3 Rugby Men's 1st 8 7 1 0 265 53 212 4.63\n4 Badminton Men's 1st 7 6 1 0 39 17 22 4.57\n5 Squash Women's 1st 8 6 2 0 26 6 20 4.25\n6 ICSM Rugby Men's 1st 9 8 0 1 332 116 216 4.00\n7 ICSM Netball Women's 2nd 5 3 2 0 199 157 42 3.80\n8 Lacrosse Women's 1st 7 6 0 1 124 21 103 3.71\n9 Table Tennis Men's 1st 7 6 0 1 96 23 73 3.71\n10 ICSM Badminton Men's 1st 7 5 1 1 42 14 28 3.29\n11 Netball Women's 2nd 7 5 1 1 245 137 108 3.29\n12 Lacrosse Men's 1st 5 4 0 1 50 34 16 3.20\n13 Squash Men's 3rd 5 4 0 1 11 4 7 3.20\n14 Volleyball Women's 1st 5 4 0 1 8 3 5 3.20\n15 ICSM Hockey Men's 1st 8 6 0 2 35 15 20 2.75\n16 Football Men's 1st 8 5 1 2 26 17 9 2.38\n17 Hockey Women's 1st 7 4 1 2 36 7 29 2.00\n18 ICSM Hockey Women's 2nd 7 3 2 2 10 18 -8 1.57\n19 Hockey Men's 2nd 6 3 1 2 12 11 1 1.50\n20 ICSM Hockey Men's 3rd 6 3 1 2 15 13 2 1.50\n21 Tennis Men's 2nd 5 3 0 2 25 25 0 1.40\n22 Squash Men's 1st 7 4 0 3 19 16 3 1.14\n23 Squash Men's 4th 7 4 0 3 12 9 3 1.14\n24 Tennis Men's 1st 7 4 0 3 43 27 16 1.14\n25 Football Men's 2nd 8 4 0 4 15 12 3 0.50\n26 Netball Women's 1st 8 4 0 4 309 275 34 0.50\n27 Basketball Men's 1st 6 3 0 3 387 388 -1 0.50\n28 ICSM Netball Women's 1st 6 3 0 3 212 201 11 0.50\n29 Rugby Men's 3rd 6 2 1 3 77 118 -41 0.00\n30 Fencing Women's 2nd 7 3 0 4 687 875 -188 -0.14\n31 Badminton Men's 2nd 5 2 0 3 16 24 -8 -0.40\n32 ICSM Hockey Women's 1st 5 2 0 3 22 17 5 -0.40\n33 Squash Men's 2nd 5 2 0 3 9 16 -7 -0.40\n34 Hockey Women's 2nd 7 2 1 4 11 26 -15 -0.57\n35 Fencing Men's 3rd 6 2 0 4 603 744 -141 -1.00\n36 Football Men's 3rd 5 1 1 3 4 17 -13 -1.00\n37 Badminton Women's 1st 7 1 2 4 24 32 -8 -1.00\n38 Tennis Women's 1st 7 1 2 4 21 49 -28 -1.00\n39 Hockey Men's 1st 6 1 1 4 13 21 -8 -1.50\n40 ICSM Football Men's 1st 6 1 1 4 6 13 -7 -1.50\n41 ICSM Netball 3rd 7 1 1 5 169 248 -79 -1.86\n42 ICSM Hockey Men's 2nd 6 0 2 4 5 26 -21 -2.00\n43 Rugby Union Men's 2nd 5 1 0 4 85 81 4 -2.20\n44 Rugby Union Men's 4th 5 1 0 4 49 127 -78 -2.20\n45 ICSM Rugby Men's 3rd 6 1 0 5 79 147 -68 -2.50\n46 Netball Women's 3rd 6 1 0 5 108 220 -112 -2.50\n47 ICSM Rugby Men's 2nd 7 1 0 6 84 253 -169 -2.71\n48 Football Women's 1st 6 0 1 5 2 34 -32 -3.00\n49 ICSM Hockey Women's 3rd 7 0 1 6 5 59 -54 -3.14\n50 ICSM Football Men's 2nd 6 0 0 6 4 33 -29 -4.00\nAfter last ditch motivational team\ntalks from both captains the game was\nto be decided on penalties. Tofis\u2019 penalty crept in after the Medicals keeper\ngot a hand to it. At 1-apiece, Benincasa\nhit the post and the Medicals capitalised to go 2-1 up. Powerful penalties\nfrom Eshun and Nathan and a miss\nfrom the Medicals brought the games\nlevel at 3-3.\nThe final penalty from College went\nto Jonathan Hill, who delivered a reliable performance after being switched\nto centre back after the injury earlier\non in the game.\nHe topped this off by placing his\npenalty to the top right hand corner of\nthe goalkeeper\u2019s posts to send the now\nonlooking 4th and 5th XI players to\npandemonium.\nThe Medicals final penalty was\ndragged wide and College emerged\nvictorious again after an exciting cup\ntie. Imperial College Medicals proved\nto be stiff opposition and credit must\ngo to the club after seemingly solved\ntheir grave defensive issues of previous\nyears.\nThis game has left both clubs with\nan inkling as to the excitement next\nyear\u2019s Varsity match could bring. College\u2019s next opponents are league leaders SOAS 1st XI, two take place at the\nbeginning of next term, a week after\ntheir much awaited league fixture.\nGeoffery Chow American Football\nI\nI\nIm\nIm\nIm\nImpe\npe\npe\npe\np\np i\nri\nri\nri\nri l\nl\nal\nal\nal\nal I\nI\nI\nI\nI\nImm\nmm\nmm\nmmor\nor\nor\norta\nta\nta\ntal\nl\nls\nls\nls\nls M\nM\nM\nM\nM\nMen\nen\nen\nen\u2019\n\u2019\n\u2019s\ns\ns\ns 2\n2\n2\n2\nBr\nBrig\night\nhton\non T\nTsu\nsuna\nnami\nmis\ns 2\n23\n3\nOn offence, it was a war of attrition\nas running backs Daniel Jones and\nAlex Karvelas found yards were hard-earned against an organised Brighton\ndefence. In the first quarter the Immortals enjoyed an early turnover as\nlinebacker Charles Kennedy forced a\nfumble, but the offence was unable to\ncapitalise on the error and fumbled the\nball back. The Tsunami scored a touchdown on the next play but Kennedy\nagain stepped up and blocked the following extra point attempt.\nThe Immortals answered with some\ngood offensive plays, including a career high 17-yard dash by Daniel Jones,\na 30-yard pass by quarterback Edward\nFisher to wide receiver Jacob Murphy\nand a 20-yard kickoff return by Geoffrey Chow. None was enough to gain\npoints but good work by the defence,\nespecially the linebacking corps of Richard Giles-Carlsson, Rob Wolsternholme, Artur Jarazbek and Dexter\nValencia meant the Immortals went to\nthe half time only 12-nil down.\nIn the second half the Immortals\nwere hit early as Brighton ran the kickoff back for a score and then followed\nthis with a touchdown on their next\npossession. The reeling Immortals\nsettled back to playing tough defence\nand the effort was rewarded when defensive end Zubin Jehangir sacked the\nTsunami quarterback in his own endzone for a safety. The defence continued to inflict turnovers as Kennedy\nand Valencia forced more fumbles and\nfree safety Arjav Trivedi picked his second interception of the season.\nDespite some strong play by the offensive line, in particular Simon Archer and Nick Tovell, the Immortals were\nunable to add to the score and eventually fell to 2-33.\nThe loss leaves the Immortals still\nlooking for their first win but they\ncan be proud of their continuing development and emerging playmaking\nabilities.\nMVP: Dexter Valencia (7 tackles, 1\nforced fumble)\nSome very happy swimmers smile for the camera\n\n"

We\u2019ll take you through the\nsteps we followed in writing this family\nfun feature.\n1 \u2013 We needed the generic Christmas\nfilm story-line. This consists of Christmas being ruined, and then fixed \u2013\nThe End.\nSo what constitutes a ruined Christmas? Someone dying. Being a family\nfilm, it needed to encompass all age\nranges so we decided to have a\nchild being savagely mauled to\ndeath by a jolly bear.\n2 \u2013 We then needed a good\nChristmassy cast. One name\nthat immediately fitted the\nbill was Hugh Grant \u2013 he\nwould be the incapa-ble, bumbling, but\nlovable Dad. Jennifer Garner is the\npragmatic, but essentially hot mum/\nwife.\n3 \u2013 The story takes place in Bear Town,\nOregon. Hugh Grant is a well-estab-lished lumberjack. His lumber-team,\nhowever, are strongly against his pro-bear ethics.\n4 \u2013 Grant\u2019s pro-bear ethics are tested\nwhen he comes home to witness his\ndaughter being brutally shredded\napart by the jolly talking dancing bear,\nplayed by Brian Blessed.\n5 \u2013 Jennifer Garner is sobbing hysteri-cally. She tells Grant to shoot the jolly\nbear, but he feels that too\nmany lives have been lost\nfor one day.\n6 \u2013 Instead, he invites the\njolly bear inside, determined\nnot to have him ruin their\nfamily Christmas. After a\ncomical evening of cha-rades, Twister and After Eights, Hugh and\nJennifer decide to\nput their differences\nwith the jolly bear\naside and ask him to\nlive with them.\nHangman writes a\nChristmas Film\nSexySanta69\nAlrite Osie, I\u2019ll do Europe and America.

I am an ex-editor of this\nshambolic newspaper. Firstly, we were\nmuch funnier in 1873. I am highly offended\nby your alternative history of felix, it was\nalmost completely inaccurate. Although I\nbelieve we did sponsor the 80s \u2013 the 1880s\nthat is. Mozart was making a comeback,\nand we were all fucked on opium anyway.\nI miss those days. Love, E.M. Mews \u201d\n\n"

We\u2019ve been talking\nto Runic Games this month about their\ngame, and we\u2019ll hopefully pop in an interview early next term.\nWe\u2019re also looking forward to Napoleon: Total War, also coming up next\nterm. 2010 should be a fine, fine year\nindeed. But as I say in my Torchlight\npiece, 2009 was a fantastic way to end the\ndecade. A truly great year, full of games\nof all shapes and sizes, and some really\nlandmark moments. Look back to 1999,\nand you\u2019ll come over all excited about\nthe prospects of the next ten years. So do\ntake a moment to read these pages and\nlook back on the year.\nBefore I go and leave the rest of the\nspread to the games themselves, congratulations to Tching-yee Yip, Lakshana Huddar, Sam Hayhurst and Sophie\nLambrakis who all took home a copy\nof Dragon Age for the 360. Hooray! And\nspeaking of ludicrous prizes, well... we\u2019ve\ngot a few this week too.\nWithout further ado, then, let\u2019s stop\nthere. Have a very Merry Christmas, and\nhopefully I\u2019ll see you in the new year.\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nA\nmanita Design are handsome and intelligent peo-ple. Not only did they\nrelease the superb and\nengaging Machinarium\nthis year, a beautifully drawn and cleverly designed little puzzler that neatly\nmanages to be simple but entertain-ing, but they even went one further to\ngive felix a free copy to give away to a\nreader. I know! Talk about getting two\nout of two right, eh? If you\u2019d like to win,\nsend an e-mail to games.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk by December 15th with the\nsubject line, \u201cDo Robots Dance \u2018The\nHuman\u2019?\u201d\n, and tell us, readers; why\nhaven\u2019t robots taken over the world\nyet? Make us laugh and win a copy.\nThe closing date is Tuesday December 15th at 6pm. So get writing!\nI\nndie gaming took a somewhat\ncurious turn this year, as LucasArts announced they would\nbe launching a game designed\nin an indie style, with a sharp\ngame concept, small budget and a set\nvisual style. The resulting Lucidity was\ncharming, if ultimately quite shallow,\nand it remains to be seen if the monolithic developer deemed it an avenue\nworthy exploring. If they decide it was,\nthen 2010 could be a very interesting\nyear indeed, with more developers trying to emulate the indie style and get a\nportion of the increasingly huge market for small, clever games.\nIn terms of true, blue indie games,\n2009 was a mixed bag. The 12th IGF\nawards list a variety of games, of which\nthree stand out in particular \u2013 Blueberry\nGarden, the surreal and quite playable\nplatformer from one-man developer\nErik Svedang; Osmos, the hypnotic re-verse-asteroids game; and the delectable\nMachinarium. Machinarium was a par-ticularhighlightformethisyear,withthe\nsort of sky-high production values that\nwe associated with Braid last year. Taking the \u2018Excellence In Visual Art\u2019 award\nwithout even trying, Machinarium is\nbeautiful, funny and well-designed, and\nsurely one of the best fully developed indie releases of the year.\nAs usual, 2009 was also a year of\namusing one-day-wonder web hits. felix Games readers wrote in praising the\nlikes of Don\u2019t Shit Your Pants, You Only\nLive Once and This Is The Only Level.\nOut of all the games that were men-tioned, though, Canabalt is probably the\nrunaway web hit of this year.\nLudicrously simple, coming from the\nsuperb Experimental Gameplay Project,\nCanabalt\u2019s one-button, beautifully presented mechanics swept across the net\nbefore most websites had realised what\nwas going on. More of this sort of thing\nnext year, please.\n2009 in indie gaming\nWin! The indie puzzler superhero Machinarium!\nWin Stuff On Good Old Games!\nWin! Santa\u2019s Sack\nA\ns you can tell, we\u2019ve\ngot a fair few competitions this week. Thanks\nto the beautiful people\nout there in Gameland,\ndevelopers and publishers have given\nfelix Games prize after prize so we\ncan give a few readers a truly excellent\nChristmas. You\u2019ll see the competitions\nscattered throughout our special dou-ble-page this week.\nOn top of all that, we\u2019ve also got a\nbumper crop of bits and pieces to give\naway in our Santa\u2019s Sack draw. One\nlucky reader will bag:\n\u2022 A copy of Dragon Age: Origins\nfor the XBox 360\n\u2022 A copy of Blood Bowl for the\nXBox 360\n\u2022 A copy of World of Zoo for the\nPC\n\u2022 A woolly Mario hat\n\u2022 A sexy Mario And Sonic At The\nOlympic Games T-Shirt\nMassive thanks go out to Electronic\nArts, Sega and THQ for supplying\nprizes to our big draw.

Well, simply\ne-mail games.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nIn your email, simply tell us; if a\nvideogame character had to replace\nSanta, which one would you send?\nMost outlandish explanations of why\nKirby is a responsible member of society (or maybe just whoever makes\nus laugh) will take home the delicious\nmetaphorical bacon that is the Santa\nSack O\u2019 Games. Good luck!\nThe closing date for this, and all competitions from this issue is Tuesday December 15th at 6pm. Winners will be\ncontacted before Christmas, and we\u2019ll do\nour best to get those prizes to you in time\nfor the holidays.\nMany thanks to the games developers, publishers and PR agencies that\nhelped Felix Games out this week. Thanks especially to Cathy Orr and\nEmber Wardrop, Sophie Orlando, Kat Osman, Lukasz Kukawski, Wonder Russell, and a particularly huge thanks to the folks over at Amanita\nGames. Merry Christmas, everyone.\nN\no, no, you can\u2019t win the\nwhole website. But we\nhave got some games to\ngive away, which is just as\ngood.

Huzzah!\nWhy are we excited about GoG.com?\nGood Old Games release the classics of\nyesteryear, the ones that are nearly impossible to find anywhere, for proper\nbudget prices and without any DRM\nwhatsoever.\nWhether it\u2019s a recently buried classic like Psychonauts, or older gems like\nFallout or games I\u2019d forgotten existed,\nlike Rise Of The Triad, there\u2019s something for everyone. Although retailers\nlike Steam do their best to get budget\nre-releases into their catalogue, noone\u2019s done it to quite the depth GoG.\ncom has.\nTo get your hands on a copy, e-mail\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk and let\nus know; if you could re-release an\nold game, which one would it be and\nwhy?

Of course I am upbeat\nfor you all, even though I also know\nthis time of year is exhausting! First\nterm nearly out the way, we have all\nbeen working hard, and perhaps would\nbenefit from a little bit of festive fun.\nSomething that I think is worth doing:\ntaking a trip around the city Christmas\ntree spotting! There is a plethora of lit-up and baubled beauties around public squares and in buildings. I would\nrecommend going to the unveiling of\nTacita Dean\u2019s tree at Tate Britain this\nThursday, the design of which as yet\nhas not been disclosed! The tradition\nat Tate (for the last 22 years) to provide\na Christmas tree has seen a variety of\ninterpretations of the tannenbaum,\nand hopefully this year will not dis-appoint! In the meantime, for me \u2018tis\nthe season for plays and evening trips\nto the theatre (well at least to the odd\nmusical as well) and my co-editor Caz\nKnight has seen plenty to share with\nyou this week in her reviews, including\na treat of a play to kick off the season\u2019s\nfestivities.\nThis week also features her review\nof the illustrious Anish Kapoor exhibition at the Royal Academy and also\na recital-cum-exhibition at the Queen\nElizabeth Hall. And now, from all of\nus at felix Arts, \u2018we wish you a Merry\nChristmas, and a Happy New Year\u2019!\nSee you next term!\n...and it was all yellow\nCaz Knight takes in vortexes and colour at the Royal Academy\nA\ncloud of reflective, silver\nspheres ascends from the\ncourtyard of the Royal\nAcademy and marks the\nbeginning of Anish Kapoor\u2019s takeover of the Academy\u2019s main\ngalleries. For the artist \u2212 one of the\nmost influential of the last thirty years\n\u2212 has most definitely made his mark\nthrough this self-titled exhibition in\nwhich the sculptures themselves are as\nmuch implemented in their own creation as the artist is.\nKapoor wants to give us both a physical and psychological experience, exploring the concepts of form, space and\ncolour. The pigment works from the\n1970s have the dusty, delicate texture\nof velvet and challenge the notion that\ncolour is merely an object\u2019s outer layer.\nKapoor demonstrates that colour can\nhypnotise and take one into a reverie,\nintoxicating us. Yellow takes up an entire wall and makes it seem as if we are\nstaring into a yellow vortex as the wall\nof the gallery seems to be sucked into\na vacuum, at the same time subverting\nform as all we can see is the hazy outline of where the wall might be.\nHis works in the adjacent room also\nescape form and make the notion of\nspace obsolete. Non-objects, a collection of concave, convex and curved\nmirrors, bend us, stretch us and\nsqueeze us making us feel like we are at\na fun fair in the hall of mirrors. We see\nourselves reflected on their surfaces\nyet we appear two dimensional and as\nif in a parallel universe (not dissimilar\nto ketamine intoxication).\nAnish Kapoor is captured by art that\nis \u2018self-generating\u2019 and contributes to\nits creation. From the ephemeral Nonobjects, we progress onto the violence\nin Shooting into the Corner, where a\ncanon blasts a twenty pound red wax\nshell onto the walls every twenty minutes creating a powerful bang and a\nsplattering of red wax. This process\ncontinues for the duration of the exhibition and now, after almost three\nmonths the effect is wonderfully reminiscent of the wave of blood emanating from the elevator in Kubrik\u2019s The\nShining. Even more impressive is the\nwork entitled Svayambh (Sanskrit for\nMerry f**king Xmas\nThe Christmas feeling is a drug... Caz Knight reviews hidden gem\nThe Night Before Christmas at the Hen and Chicken\u2019s Theatre\nU\np the Victoria Line to\nHighbury and Islington,\nthen out the tube and\ndown the road and you\narrive at a small and cosy\npub, with Christmas stockings hanging\nabove the fireplace and lights decorating the festive interior. This is the Hen\nand Chicken\u2019s theatre bar. The theatre\nitself is tucked up a narrow set of stairs\nin an even smaller studio space, the\nsetting for the Signal Theatre Company\u2019s production of Anthony Neilson\u2019s\n\u2018The Night Before Christmas\u2019.\nPulled from his bed on Christmas\nEve, Simon is dragged to his friend\nGary\u2019s warehouse to see what he has\nfound among the boxes of stolen toys\nand merchandise: an Elf! Rather, an\n\u201cemployee in an international present\ndistribution agency\u201d. Trying to convince them that he is, indeed, an Elf\nand not a burglar, Simon and Gary\nlearn more and more about the true\nChristmas spirit (it\u2019s a drug sprinkled\nin the homes of children and only felt\nby virgins) with things becoming more\ncomplicated and more comical upon\nthe arrival of Gary\u2019s \u201cscrubber\u201d, Cherry, played by producer and co-creator\nof the Signal Theatre company, Kellie\nBatchelor.\nThis short little play is packed full\nof quick paced dialogue, superb jokes\nand just the right amount of smutty\nhumour without relying on any of the\ncheesy slapstick that abounds in most\nmodern comedies. The cast makes a\nbrilliant team with all four performers adding their own spark to the play,\nacting with energy and quite clearly\nenjoying every minute of it. Watching\nthe play is so delightful and easy; this is\nhow theatre should be and how it definitely would have been for audiences\nwatching Shakespeare\u2019s plays back in\nhis day.\nSuch an intimate and unassuming\nsetting makes for a much more unique\nand special experience and The Night\nBefore Christmas with its enthusiastic and warm cast fitted the location\nperfectly. An ideal way to spend an\nevening away from the throngs of tourists and tides of the usual theatre-goers\nin Theatreland. If only more theatre\nwas like this. I urge anyone and everyone to spare an hour and go to this hidden gem of a production regardless of\nhow much of a Grinch you are!\nThe Night Before Christmas is on\nTues-Sat 9.30pm until 19th December\nat the Hen & Chicken\u2019s theatre.\nTube: Highbury & Islington\nStudents \u00a310\n\u2018self-generating\u2019) which sees a colossal wax block shuttled at a snail\u2019s pace\n(it takes one hour and a half from one\nend to the other) up and down through\nthree of the gallery\u2019s rooms, leaving\nin its wake a smearing of red wax and\nbringing to our minds all our own associations with the colour red.\nOther rooms house sculptures which\nrange from the massive, twisting marble Slug to the \u2018scatlogical\u2019 Greyman\nCries, Shaman Dies, Billowing Smoke,\nBeauty Evoked where Kapoor has used\na three-dimensional printer that ejects\ncement to create these piles by inputting a design into the machine. All his\nworks dominate the classical white interior of the Royal Academy, with their\nmonochrome colour of reds, yellows\nand bronzes contrasting magnificently\nwith the stark white walls. Anish Kapoor\u2019s exhibition leaves you with the\nfeeling you have fully engaged with his\nsculptures and experienced something\nquite different from any exhibition you\nhave seen before.\nEnds today Friday 11th December\nI\nn 1870 composer Modest Mussorgsky and artist Viktor Hartmann became friends, sharing a\ndevotion to the cause of Russian\nart. But four years later Hartmann died of an aneurysm leaving his\ngood friend distraught. In his memory,\nMussorgsky commissioned an exhibition in St Petersburg of over 400 of the\nartist\u2019s watercolours, many depicting\nlocales from his travels around Europe.\nInspired by such a vast collection Mussorgsky composed the suite Pictures at\nan Exhibition \u2212 a soundtrack to these\nimages; an imaginary tour of the exhibition with the movements named\nafter ten of the paintings and flowing\nin a way as a viewer might through the\nexhibition.\nJoined by their fascination for Pictures at an Exhibition, internationally\nacclaimed pianist Leif Ove Andsnes\nand artist Robin Rhode have collaborated to bring us Pictures Reframed,\ncombining the skill of Andsnes\u2019 piano\nplaying with the ingenuity of Rhode\u2019s\ndrawing, performance and video. Such\nmulti-media collaborations may seem\nmodern and, some may say, preten-tious, but it is clear that such an idea\nof art inspiring music and then the two\nbeing combined dates back well over\none hundred years!\nThe Queen Elizabeth Hall provides an ideally comfortable setting in\nwhich to enjoy such sumptuous playing teamed with the playful black and\nwhite sequence of Rhode\u2019s sketches\nand video, themselves projected onto\nlarge screens behind the stage on\nwhich sits the majestic grand piano.\nEighty minutes without hearing or seeing a word, in either their vocal or written form, only added to the powerful\nimpact of both artists\u2019 work.\nDisappointingly, Robin Rhode was\nnot present for the introductory talk\nbut perhaps this only reinforces the\nmystery about him; his face is never\nrevealed in his sketches or his videos.\nAs well as music from Pictures at an\nExhibition, Andsnes astounds us with\nhis sheer technical genius as he also\nplays a suitably childish \u2018Kinderszenen\u2019\nby Schumann, fitting in with the children present in Rhode\u2019s work. Lighting\ndesigner, David Weiner, lit the stage\nperfectly, revealing only the pianist\u2019s\nface and hands and the keys on which\nthey played - highly reminiscent of a\nwork of Rhode\u2019s Keys, which was on\nshow this time last year at the Hayward Gallery in his exhibition \u2018Who\nSaw Who\u2019.\nWhat a treat it was to hear the velvet\nsounds of the piano and at the same\ntime look upon Rhode\u2019s work which\nbecame ever more comical with a video of a chicken being chased and finally ending as we watched a grand piano\nbeing slowly engulfed by water as the\ntide comes in; a wonderful evening out\non London\u2019s South Bank.\nFor an example of Robin Rhode\u2019s\nwork, go to:\nhttp://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/\nminisite/robin-rhode/\nA lovely piano soiree\n\n"

No srlsy halp! Yesterday was\nthe second ACC bar night of the\nterm, and after the \u201cdifficulties\u201d of\nthe first, my vice (Zubin) and I brain-stormed, Zubin bench pressed the\ndesk a few hundred times and we got\nthe new mobile bar more, much more\njugs. Oh yeah, and karaoke, everyone\nloves a bit of the karaoke. The result...\nabsolute carnage, literally the whole of\nmy body hurts. Now I\u2019ve never fallen\nout of an aeroplane at 40,000 ft without a parachute, I\u2019m not an idiot, but\nI know how much pain that would\ninduce. It was a night of epic propor-tions, we even bust out the yard glass!\nSo yeah good stuff.\nMoving back to the Vomit Pit idea\nthat I brought up a couple of weeks\nago, you\u2019ll all be glad to know that we\nhave had a group meeting and there\nhave been a few issues raised. Firstly the age old problem of throwing\nfreshers down wells to see is they are\nwitches or not. So to ensure that a poor\nfresher is not thrown down the Pit to\nsee if they are a floater or not, we\u2019re\ngoing to have to install a grill over the\nopening. There will also be a handrail\nto hold onto whilst having your tech-nicolour yawn, which doubles up as a\nbarrier to stop people accidently slipping on the vomit grill.\nSecondly there are numerous events\nthat go on in the upper echelons of the\nUnion. Noticeably the tie club dinners\nand RSM events. Now these \u201cdinners\u201d\ntend to end up a little messy, and some\npoor sod has to rock out with a mob\nand bucket. Not good. So the simple\nway to solve this is to install one of\nthose big blue shoots that builders use\nto drop stuff off of the top of some scaffolding and into a skip. This can be attached to and open window and take\nall the vomit straight into the pit. At\nthe end of the night, the shoot can be\nwashed down with a bit of water and it\u2019s\nright as the mail. If there\u2019s not a strike\non. All these ideas have been submitted\nto Phase 3 development group, but we\nneed your backing! Apologies for a few\ngeneral \u2018mares last week, I was cocking\nbusy and couldn\u2019t really be arsed that\nmuch. Anyway, as I forgot to change\nthe quote last week, I\u2019ve given you two\nto chew down. One is a particularly\neloquent way to ask for a pint of two, I\nsuggest you use it as often as you possibly can. The results are interesting,\nyou\u2019ll be surprised!

Chiefs have\ncome under fire from critics who ask\nwhether the six figure salaries in addition to the accommodation awarded\nto the top University positions are\njustified.\nThe response given by Universities\nis that chiefs are often required to entertain guests and prospective donors\nusing their homes, so they are considered work premises. Sally Hunt, general\nsecretary of the University and College\nUnion argues \u2018\u2019staff faced with losing\ntheir job being asked to accept a real-terms pay cut and teaching more and\nmore students will, understandably, be\nless than impressed at vice-chancellors\u2019\nlavish lifestyles.\u2019\u2019\nShe continued, \u2018\u2019they do not inhabit\nanything like the same world as their\nstaff. Thanks to inflation-busting pay\nrises in recent years, an incredible 71\nof them now earn more than the Prime\nMinister.\u2019\u2019\nAs critics call for end to luxury for University chiefs,\nAlex Karapetian investigates the Rector\u2019s standing in all of this\nThe academic pay in Universities\nrose faster than the national average in\n2007-2008, with turnovers matching\nthose of major businesses. According to\nthe Higher Education Statistics Agency\n(HESA), average UK academics earned\nsalaries of around \u00a343,486, while the\naverage professor earned \u00a369,870. Imperial has applied about 150 job cuts\nin medicine and languages.

The\nterm started with the first ever ULU\nswimming league fixture against teams\nfrom Queen Mary and King\u2019s College.\nThis competition, designed to get all\nLondon universities more involved in\nswimming, looked to be a promising\nconquest for the swimming club, as\none of the stronger teams in London.\nThe team did not disappoint, with\nall swimmers putting in 100% over\nthe evening, which resulted in a convincing win over the other teams, in\nwhich imperial won more than 75%\nof the events swum, and gained nearly\ndouble the points of the other teams.\nSpecial mention must go to Hannah\nCollins and her victories in the 100m\nindividual medley, breastroke and butterfly over the course of the evening.\nNext came the national BUCS individual gala, in which Imperial swimmers had headed up to Sheffield to take\non some of the best talent in Britain,\nincluding team GB and Olympic swim-mers, as well as a world champion.\nNeedless to say this was a tough\nask for the team who all swum well,\nwith some of the new members of the\nsquad posting promising times to be\nworked on, and relay teams that look\nto be reaching finals in years to come.\nSpecial mention must go to Thomas\nWhitehead-Clarke finishing 21st in\nthe 200m butterfly, as well as Timothy Marshall\u2019s epic performance in the\n50M backstroke.\nMost notably, Imperial out-per-formed all other individual London\nuniversities, securing its place as the\nbest swimming university in London.\nFollowing this was the BUCS team\nevent, where once again competition was tough, especially as the team\ngained promotion to Division 1 last\nyear, and so were taking on seven of the\nbest teams in the country.\nDespite some impressive swims,\nincluding a personal best for Florain\nBrock, a lack of fit swimmers for the\nclub lead to an unfortunate relegation,\nand the team will now look favourite\nto gain points in next year\u2019s division 2\nfinal.\nFinally, last week came the second of\nthree ULU galas for the year, and with\nsuch a convincing win behind them,\nthe team decided to field a more modest team for the gala. All swimmers\nperformed exceptionally, with many\nposting fantastic times, including Tom\nTrimnell, Giuliano Sison, Cecily Barber and Amy McCallin; giving great\nhope for the club next year.\nIC swimming has a\nwhale of a term\nImperial managed to go on and win\nthe gala, meaning that they have now\nwon the inaugural ULU swimming\nleague with one competition to spare.\nThey hope to go and make a clean\nsweep of the year, bringing a new trophy home for the university. Next year\nthe team will be heading up to Sheffield for another national competition,\nas well as a possible trip to Europe to\ncompete in the IDEA league\nThe club would like to thank the\nsupport they have received from their\ncoach Sergio Catania, as well as FastFins swim school and Jonas Grau.\nContinued from Back Page\nCourageous\nGaelic Girls\nULU\u2019s best Swimming club are all smiles at their second successful Gala.

    "content": "21\nfelix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk FILM\nThe top fifty films of the decade\n10. District 9 (2009) Neill Blomkamp\nA controversial choice perhaps to be considered as one the ten best films of the decade. The highly enjoyable plot is an\nanalogy to the real life treatment of Zimbabwean refugees in South Africa, only replacing the refugees with 7\u201d tall prawns.\nThe frantic plot is maintained by well choreographed action and the ultimately selfish protagonist Wikus is one of the\nmost realistic anti-heroes ever committed to celluloid. Entertaining and thought-provoking, a balance hard to get.\n9. City of God (2002) Fernando Meirelles\n8. Gladiator (2000) Ridley Scott\n7. Children of Men (2006) Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\n6. No Country for Old Men (2007) Coen Bros.\n5. The Proposition (2005) John Hillcoat\n4. Oldboy (2005) Chan-wook Park\n3. Brokeback Mountain (2005) Ang Lee\n2. There Will be Blood (2007) Paul Anderson\n1. Memento (2000) Christopher Nolan\n50 - 11\nFilm Editor Ed Knock presents his choices, if you disagree, then tell him at film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSet in a violent slum of Rio de Janeiro known as the \u2018City of God\u2019, this film does not rely on the plenty of uncompromising\nviolence that inhabits it. Instead the personal relationships between characters shines through including nice touches\nsuch as the banana dildo conversation and the leaving party in which every clique of society is introduced. The film blew\naway critics and made Brian de Palma\u2019s Scarface look silly in its gritty depictions of gang warfare with a touch of style.\nHow Ridley Scott reinvented the \u2018Sword and Sandal\u2019 epic is no mystery. Combining a great script and breath-taking combat scenes with incredible special effects, Gladiator thrust Russell Crowe into the \u2018A\u2019 list of actors. It took several viewings\nuntil I noticed the intricate plot and full appreciation of the supporting talent of Oliver Reed and Djimon Hounsou. Let\u2019s\nnot forget the magnificent reproduction of Colosseum and the immortal lines \u201cOn my command, unleash Hell!\u201d\nReleased to little fanfare but then slowly gaining critical acclaim and some commercial success, Children of Men has to\nbe one of the best made films ever. The dystopian future is vividly imagined, more creative than the shiny skyscrapers of\nMinority Report and more believable than the perpetual darkness of Blade Runner. The plot slowly builds momentum\nresulting in the greatest tracking shot of all time presenting over 5 minutes of pure cinema gold.\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Cormac McCarthy, No Country for Old Men is most memorable for one\nman - Javier Bardem. His portrayal of sociopath who goes beyond any rational thinking gripped audiences across the\nworld and he deservedly one an Oscar for it. Let\u2019s not forget the perfect pacing of the film by the greatest two directors to\nhave emerged in the last twenty years, Joel and Ethan Coen , and combined with stunning cinematography - film ecstasy\nA relatively unknown film placed so far up my list? Hollywood was so impressed by John Hillcoat savage Australian pioneer drama they gave the new Cormac McCarthy adaption of The Road for him to direct. The Proposition contains a stellar\ncast of Guy Pierce, Ray Winston, Danny Huston, John Hurt and Emily Watson. The film is daring and adventurous but\nmasterfully directed with loving attention to detail of the violent landscape of 19th Century Australia.\n50. Anchorman\n49. Downfall\n48. The Wind that Shakes the Barley\n47. Amelie\n46. Borat\n45. Being John Malkovitch\n44. Lost in Translation\n43. Into the Wild\n42. Love Exposure\n41. Hotel Rwanda\n40. Wall-e\n39. Traffic\n38. 28 Days Later\n37. The Lives of Others\n36. Billy Elliot\n35. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\n34. Casino Royale\n33. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n32. Crash\n31. Inglourious Basterds\n30. Thank you for Smoking\n29. The Fellowship of the Ring\n28. The Pianist\n27. Control\n26. This is England\n25. Finding Nemo\n24. The Bourne Identity\n23. In Bruges\n22. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n21. Battle Royale\n20. Waltz with Bashir\n19. Donnie Darko\n18. The Constant Gardener\n17. Pan\u2019s Labyrinth\n16. Slumdog Millionaire\n15. The Dark Knight\n14. Dead Man\u2019s Shoes\n13. Spirited Away\n12. The Departed\n11. Requiem for a Dream\nThe best film out of the Lady Vengeance trilogy, Oldboy gave Chan-wook Park an international reputation and introduced Korean cinema to Western audiences. An intricate plot with so many mind-blowing twists and turns revolving\naround the theme of vengeance and an ending so shocking that you finish the film wondering if you should have enjoyed\nit. Well yes you should have, the immortal image of Dae-su holding an hammer will be ingrained in your memory for ever.\nIt\u2019s so wrong to brand this film as \u2018Gay cinema\u2019 and therefore only good because of its brave portrayal of a homosexual\nrelationship. The film is masterfully directed and contains delicate performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nThe story of a secret and forbidden love is hauntingly tragic as the decades span and the two lovers realise that their annual finishing trips are simply not enough to be happy. Outrageously, its Oscar was given to Crash.\n\u2018I drink your milkshake!\u2019 has now entered the common pop culture vocabulary and it\u2019s easy to see why. The theme is\ngreed, be it money or religious exploitation. Daniel Day Lewis\u2019 Oscar winning John Huston impersonation is the driving\nforce of the film and his performance rivals Robert de Niro\u2019s in Taxi Driver. People complained of the lack of plot but this\nfilm is a character study into the dark heart of capitalism leading to a crescendo of immorality in the explosive finale.\nTwo films with Guy Pierce in my top five, some might say I have a man-crush on him. However Memento has to be top\nfilm of the decade. The backwards plot is beautifully constructed and it requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate the\nintricate plot and the twist at the end will leave you dazed for weeks. Joe Pantoliano soon finds himself out of his depth\nas he exploits the severely amnesiac Pierce who can\u2019t make new memories and so tattoos the \u2018facts\u2019 on his body. Genius.\n\n"

This put us\n1-0 up.\nThe next ten minutes proved that IC\ncould really compete in this league and\nsome champagne hockey upfront between Krusty, Koch and Diana proved\nto be decisive as Yogi got his second\ngoal of the match, finishing the move\nwell to send us 2-0 up.\nIn the second half, IC dominated,\nonly conceding a lucky consolation\ngoal in the closing five minutes and\ncould well have scored more, however\ndespite some terrible administrative\nerrors from their goalkeeper IC were\nunable to increase their lead.\nThe performance gives the 1st XI\nrenewed belief as they move into the\nfinal two games, fighting against the\nthreat of relegation in this tight league.\nThe following Sunday saw the Men\u2019s\n1st XI open their ULU cup account\nagainst the Royal Veterinary College\nin the enchanting commuter town of\nPotters Bar.\nThe weather made champagne hockey nearly impossible, with rain, hail\nand high winds throughout the game.\nDespite this hindrance, IC made light\nwork of the Vets\u2019 side, with an early hat\ntrick from Stumpy leaving the opposition in no doubt as to who was going to\ndominate the game.\nStumpy also had several more opportunities to hit the back of the net,\nalthough his attempts were thwarted\non one occasion by the head of a de-fender, requiring the poor Vet student\nto make a trip to the hospital to get his\nskull stitched back together.\nA fourth goal from Stumpy and a\nfirst for Dennis meant IC cruised into\nthe break 5-0 up.\nGoals from Krusty, Yogi and another\nfor Dennis in the second half put the\ngame completely out of reach of the\nopposition and also gave goalkeeper\nET a chance to update his spread-sheets, prepare the club\u2019s cash flow\nforecast and visit the local bank to pay\nin the team\u2019s match fees, such was the\n(lacking) frequency of the attacks on\nhis goal.\nIn short, IC came away with a\nthumping 8-0 victory, progressing into\nthe second round of the cup where\nthey are likely to meet Imperial College\nMedicals in the New Year.\nChris Baker-Brian Hockey\nM\nM\nMe \u2019\n\u2019\nns 1st\nt XI\nXI\nXI 2\nU\nUniversity of\nf K\nKent 1st X\nXI\nI 1\nM\nM\nMe\nMe\nMe\nMe \u2019\n\u2019\n\u2019\nn\u2019\nn\nn\nns\ns\ns\ns 1s\n1s\n1s\n1st\nt\nt\nt\nt XI\nXI\nXI\nXI\nXI\nXI 8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\nRo\nRoya\nyal\nl Ve\nVete\nteri\nrina\nnary\nry C\nCol\nolle\nlege\nge 1\n1s\ns 0\n0\nChallenge Cup Drama\nGaelic Ladies\nput up \u2018a fight\u2019\nagainst St\nMary\u2019s\nICUAFCs Men\u2019s 1st XI began their\nULU Challenge Cup against the Imperial College Medicals 1st XI, familiar\nfaces once a year in the Varsity match.\nThis tie is sometimes a weird one to\njudge, especially when the seriousness\nof both teams is put into question. After a joke of a Varsity last where College were 5-nil victors despite fielding\na weakened side and having 2 players\nsent-off, respective captains Mustapher Botchway and Karim Amer ensured that this game will be played to\na standard worth watching.\nDespite the Medicals playing ULU\nfootball one league below College, they\nwere more fired up at the beginning of\nthe game. After an injury to College\ncentre back Tom Fryatt, they deservedly went 1-nil up when a flurry of corners in the space of 4 minutes were not\ndealt with correctly; the 5th of these\nLast Sunday, the Imperial College Ladies Gaelic football team set off in a\nminibus borrowed from the King\u2019s\nSchool, Pontefract (long bizarre sto-ry) for their competitive debut. Our\nexpectations were not as high as our\nspirits as we drove through the pouring rain to St Mary\u2019s impressive sports\nfacilities. Optimism levels were high as\nKatie \u201cthe wall\u201d Cullen shouted our positions over the sound of rain hammering on the minibus roof and explained\nwhat the phrase \u201cwing-back\u201d actually\nmeant. Finally, the imposing silhouette\nof the St Mary\u2019s captain filled the windscreen and took us to the club house\nwhere the Mary\u2019s girls were collecting,\neach decked out in inter-county attire\nand built like a brick sh*t house. Mia\namongst others managed to keep team\nmorale up as we \u201cwarmed up\u201d in the ridiculous weather conditions.\nSt. Mary\u2019s eventually decided to\ngrace us with their presence (after\none or two trips from their cars to the\nclubhouse) and joined us on the rugby\npitch. As they turned their county-level Gaelic football shirts inside out\nwe, slightly smugly, tucked our Imperial Men\u2019s Gaelic football team shirts\n(which could be mistaken for Gaelic\nfootball dresses) into our shorts.\nThe game began. Carla was quick off\nthe mark with her first (& only) contribution to the game - tonking the ball\nthe wrong way and beautifully setting\nup a \u201cgirl\u201d from St Mary\u2019s for a shot\non goal. Unfortunately, she pulled a\nmuscle executing this excellent assist\nand was subsequently stretchered off\nto coach the team from the sidelines\nand record fines in Katie\u2019s little black\nbook to be paid for in the union later.\nSadly, the ball was to remain in our\nhalf for the opening of the game. As a\nwing forward, I plainly pulled out some\npopcorn and watched, with Cathy and\nSarah, as our team mates wrestled\nwith the team of \u201cmountain women\u201d\nfor a few minutes before we had the\nrevelation of going to help them. As\nthe minutes ticked by, and one or two\ngoals somehow skimmed past Katie,\nwe learnt and grew as fast as the fame\nof an X Factor finalist and brought the\ngame to a new level. With Chloe and\nSophie, amongst others, getting on the\nend of some awesome kick passes from\nMoira and splitting the St Mary\u2019s de-fence, Andy and Phil would have been\nproud.\nThe half-time whistle blew and,\nthough the score line was a lot to noth-ing, Imperial were un-phased and enthusiastic to get going again.

Miss\nPatterson formerly a 4th year Geology\nMasters student, was encouraged by\nher department to graduate immediately with a BSci instead of continuing\nher studies this year.

The night ended\nsourly as organiser Jovan Nedic ended\nup being banned from the Union with\nimmediate effect by dinner guest and\nUnion President Ashley Brown.\nThe evening began with a reception\nat the Union bar which was a great opportunity for multiple generations of\nfelix editors and writers to share stories of their experience at the paper\nand at Imperial College. A tour of the\nfelix office was conducted by the current team for those who had not seen\nit since they left which in some cases,\nhad been a matter of decades.\nFor some of these guests especially,\nthe change in the office was bewilder-ing. David Cooper, who was the Editor-in-Chief of felix 40 years ago, later\nremarked in his toast during dinner\nhow different the office looked from\nhis days at felix.\nThe rest of the evening was enjoyed\nover a three-course dinner at the Union Dining Hall, during which speeches were given, including those by Dan\nWan and Jovan Nedic. The first guest\nspeaker of the evening, Imperial alumnus and science writer Simon Singh,\nalso recounted his years as a physics\nundergraduate and RSCU president.\nSingh went on to share his thoughts\non the UK libel laws, before he gives a\nguest lecture at Imperial this week.\nThe second guest speaker during dinner was ex-felix Editor Pallab Ghosh,\nwho is currently a BBC Science Correspondent. He spoke enthusiastically\nabout his career in science journalism\nand admitted that working at felix gave\nhim gave him a taste of, and ultimately\nled him towards, becoming a scientific\nreporter.\nA felix awards ceremony followed the\nspeeches; each award was presented by\nJovan Nedic and bottles of champagne\nwere awarded to the winners of each\nsection.\nThe event was wrapped up with a photo opportunity, and before we could all\nsay \u2018cheese\u2019\n, the celebration of 60 years of\nfelix had been captured in a photograph.\nAs the night\u2019s proceedings came to\nan end, tension strings snapped between the Union bar staff, providing\ndrinks throughout the evening, and\nNedic. The removal of the unused keg\nof beer from behind the portable bar\nsparked off an argument that resulted\nan innebriated Nedic berating members of the Union staff behind Da Vinci\u2019s bar. He was subsequently banned\nfrom the Union for a week without a\nhearing by a present Ashley Brown.\nLord Browne discusses HE with President Brown\nO\nn the 9th November,\nthe Independent Review of Higher Education Funding and\nStudent Finance was\nlaunched.

He would have been even\nmore delighted to find that the orchestra contained several chemists - he was\nan enthusiastic amateur chemist, with\na patent for a device producing a reagent required for qualitative analysis.\n(When he lived in Hereford he had his\nown laboratory where he produced at\nleast one large inadvertent explosion.\nFortunately, when he moved to London, he confined his experimental scientific interests to microscopy). The\nCockaigne overture, describing the\nparks, the pageantry and general good\nfellowship of London (features that,\nfortunately, are still discernible) demands excellence from all the sections\nof the orchestra, but the brass section\nhad the best opportunity and took it,\ngiving a bravura performance.\nMany composers (and Mozart in\nparticular) are reputed to have enjoyed\nplaying the viola rather than the violin,\npossibly because of the satisfaction felt\nat contributing more expressively to\nthe harmony, but Haydn, Mozart and\nBeethoven did not compose concertos\nfor solo viola. Both Benjamin Britten\nand his teacher, Frank Bridge, were\nviolists, but neither wrote a concerto\nfor the solo instrument. Only very\nrecently has the repertoire expanded\nappreciably under the influence of Yuri\nBashmet. So we are grateful to Franz\nHoffmeister, Mozart\u2019s Viennese contemporary and very talented friend,\nwho wrote two (now neglected) concertos for viola. Congratulations are\ndue to whoever put it into the pro-gramme. The soloist for this perform-ance, Duncan Anderson (Viola Section\nPrincipal for ICSO), gave an impeccable account with sufficient power never\nto have been submerged by the orches-tra. As Hoffmeister intended, we were\nshown the mellow tones of the viola\nand, particularly in the closing rondo,\nits great agility. The two intricate and\ndemanding cadenzas in the concerto\nwere composed by Franco Gulli (1926-2001), an Italian-American violin vir-tuoso. The soloist negotiated them,\napparently effortlessly, with great skill.\nOn the basis of this performance, the\nD major concerto is unjustly neglected\nand your reviewer will be looking for a\nrecording.\nI thought I knew the Rachmaninov\nsecond symphony pretty well, but the\norchestra, under the deeply informed\ndirection of Richard Dickins, showed\nseveral felicitous features of the orchestration that I hadn\u2019t noticed before\nand he drew some beautifully turned\nphrases from the strings. From the\nbeginning, it was clear that we would\nbe treated to the passionate kind of\nperformance that the music needs and\nthat a young orchestra can provide.\nThe precision of the playing came\nout very well in the whirling fugato of\nthe second movement. The beautiful\nmain theme of the third movement\n(Adagio), on the clarinet of the section\nprincipal, could not have been better\nplayed. It was sensitively done, without too much rubato, and the woodwind section as a whole subsequently\nproduced lovely decoration. The last\nmovement (Allegro vivace) is a magnificent edifice with a glorious theme\nfor the strings and is also a great joy for\nthe brass section. At the conclusion,\nthe large audience was drawn into wild\napplause. The symphony, without the\ntraditional cuts, took about an hour.\nWith a performance of this quality, one\nis left regretting that it all had to end.\nThe new style of the programme\nbooklet, with several high definition\ncolour photographs of the orches-tra, soloist and conductor and text\nthat is easy on the eye, is very much\nappreciated.\nThe audience at the Johannesburg\nInternational Mozart Festival is in for\na great treat when ICSO gives a few\nconcerts, including Cockaigne and the\nRachmaninov symphony, over a long\nweekend at the end of January. ICSO\nis a great ambassador and not just for\nIC. The England Cricket Team will\njust have concluded their tour of South\nAfrica and their results will depend on\nthe pitches - but the ICSO pitch is always perfect!\nEmail: icso@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhere are two kinds of people in the world, partitioned by how they react\nwhen facing adversity.\nThose of the first kind accept that life is not always easy, react\nwith good cheer and a can-do spirit,\nand ultimately overcome. Those of the\nother sort moan, grumble, and ultimately buckle.\nThere was no shortage of adversity\non the recent trip to Cadair Idris. The\nmountain is 893m high and lies at the\nsouthern end of Snowdonia national\npark. It is notable both in Welsh history and mythology: Dafydd, the last\nWelsh Prince of Wales, was captured at\nits foot in 1283, while those who sleep\non its slopes are supposed to wake up\neither madmen or poets. Frankly, given the weather we faced, you\u2019d have to\nbe a madman to ascend it in the first\nplace.\nThe trip started well. The club departed the metropolis on the Friday\nevening for the long drive to Wales. As\nwe approached the border, the weather\nstarted to turn; by the time we arrived\nat the cabin, it was raining quite heav-ily, and the unloading of the van was\nhurried so that we could take shelter.\nAs we settled into the cabin, the radio\ninformed us that we had arrived during\nthe worst storm of the year. Excellent!\nWe love a challenge.\nDuring a brief break in the rain,\nMireia and I took the chance to go outside and admire the sky; with few lights\naround, you can see thousands of stars.\nThe night sky is one of the things I miss\nabout living in the city, and so becomes\none of the best reasons for leaving it.\nDuring the night, my snoozing was\ninterrupted by thunder and lightning:\njust the sort of thing you want to hear\nwhen you\u2019re going hiking the next day!\nThe wake-up call was exceedingly\ngentle: no great hurry, porridge cooked\nfor you, plenty of time for faff. The\nrain was pelting down, but we eagerly\ndonned our waterproofs and set out in\ngood cheer. As there were thirty of us,\nthe group soon divided in two; I stayed\nwith Alex, while the other half took a\ndifferent route under the trusty stewardship of Jim.\nOne of the things I found odd about\nthe English when I moved here was\nhow much less chatty they are, compared to my fellow Irishmen. It has\ntaken me a few years to understand\nthat it isn\u2019t that the English are trying\nto be rude; it\u2019s just that they are a bit\nmore reserved, and once you get past\nthat they are as friendly as anyone\nelse. By contrast to the usual standard in London, the Fellwanderers are\nthe friendliest bunch of people I have\nfound at Imperial. I am not a sociolo-gist, but if I were to hazard a guess, I\nwould hypothesise that it is because\nwhen you are going out in a storm for\nhalf a day, it is much more pleasant to\nconverse with your companions than\nglumly march in the rain. When you\nknow that you will be talking for several hours, you are much more willing to\npartake in tales, yarns, digressions and\ntangents. It really does work: the time\nalways flies, regardless of the weather.\nThe weather was indeed atrocious.\nThe rain lashed down unforgivingly on\nthe slopes, soaking everyone. In those\nkinds of conditions, waterproofs are at\nbest approximations, and within some\nhours everyone was wet. We walked to\nthe rhythmic squelch of soggy socks.\nThe approach to the summit is covered in scree, a haphazard accumulation of broken rock fragments that\nmake for a treacherous path underfoot.\nThe rocks jut at odd angles, shift and\nrotate as you put your weight on them,\nand generally make themselves a nui-sance. Most of us tiptoed tentatively,\ntesting the next rock before commit-ting, but Valdas sauntered along, unconcerned about the ground under-foot, as though he were on his way to\na ball.\nThe best part of the trip was undoubtedly the scramble to the top. The\nrainfall had engorged a stream running\ndown from the summit, so it meandered aside and through the route up\nwe were to take. At times, the mountain presented an angle of sixty degrees\nto the horizontal, and we regularly had\nto use our hands to maintain balance\nwhile we sought the next toehold. Fortunately, the wind was to our backs,\nand halfway up the approach the rain\nlessened, then stopped. By that point,\nthe drum of the rain had passed into\nwhite noise, and it took several minutes for me to even realise that the rain\nhad waned. Near the top we even saw\nblue sky, for the whole of ten seconds!\nWe finally ascended the mountain,\nto find that the winds on top were incredibly strong. While Mathieu took\nthe photo of me at the trig point on the\ntop, I held on out of genuine fear that I\nwould be knocked over. If your camera\nwere held in the palm of your hand, it\nactually would have been blown away.\nFortunately, some clever fellow had decided to build a hut on the top: it might\nhave had five centimetres of water on\nthe ground, but at least it gave shelter\nfrom the wind. We huddled and shivered and ate our sandwiches.\nThe way down wasn\u2019t much easier.\nOn the descent, the wind was so strong\nthat you had to compensate for it when\nyou were planning your next step; when\nit would gust or weaken for a moment,\nyour planning went awry. With the\nwind came a lashing spray, which stung\nthe side of your face. Everyone walked\nwith their hand to their eye.\nOn the lower slopes, the weather\neased, and we got some beautiful views\nof the Welsh coastline from the side of\nthe mountain. By the time we got back\nto the cabin, everyone was drenched\nbut smiling. I braved a cold shower in\nthe cabin and sat around the fire to\ndry myself out as I waited for dinner.\nThere is a wonderfully satisfying feeling that comes from being warm and\ndry after braving such conditions: not\nonly do you feel glad that you achieved\nwhat you set out to do, but the contrast\nbetween the fresh memories of discomfort and your current situation enhances the whole experience. Between\nthe roaring fire and the good company,\nthe time until dinner passed quickly.\nJim cooked an exquisite chicken and\nleek stew, followed by apple pie and\ncustard. I went to sleep happy.\nWe also walked on the Sunday, but I\nam confident that you have gotten the\nidea by now.\nDespite the weather, or actually because of it, I had an awesome time. The\nmost striking part? No one moaned for\nthe whole weekend. If you are interested in adventure, the outdoors, and\ngood company, then the Fellwanderers\nappears to be the club to join.\nPatrick Farrell joins the Fellwanderers in a Welsh storm\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\n8 felix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nlike to think of myself as a reasonable man. I like to think that\nI can be depended on to make\nthe responsible choice when\nit comes down to it, and that I\nspeak my truth qui-oh wait. No, sorry,\nlet me start again.\nI like to think of myself as an inherently unreasonable bastard. I like to\nthink that I largely cannot be relied\non at all, and that anyone who\u2019s stupid enough to do so will end up disappointed and possibly barred from\nentering the US and its protectorates.\nI just want to establish that before we\ngo any further, in case there\u2019s any accusations of holier-than-thouness. I\u2019m\na bitter, sociopathic twat.\nBut, you see, I\u2019m not in a position\nof responsibility. I\u2019m a student, and\nan anonymous commenter on a small\nstudent paper. I don\u2019t get asked for\ninterviews with G2, I don\u2019t get letters\nfrom ten year-olds saying they want\nto be like me when they grow up, and\nabove all else, I\u2019m not being paid to\ndo anything in particular. I can basically do whatever I like and not feel all\nthat bad about it, because no-one takes\nmuch notice.\nSo I take a pretty dim view of student\npolitics. In all my many/few years at\nImperial the only sabbaticals I\u2019ve ever\nhad any respect for have been the felix\neditors; other than that, the other political positions at Imperial are like flypaper for morons. Flypaper made out\nof large salary cheques, coincidentally.\nThe problem with student politics is\nthat whilst the argument for its existence is so strong - you need students\ndeciding certain things, like what goes\ninto felix or what we do in Freshers\u2019\nWeek - the actual usefulness of the positions rarely extends beyond the few\ntiny examples that are used to justify\ntheir existence.\nSo it boils down to two flavours of\npeople - the backbiting incompetents,\nand the dullards. In the dullard corner,\nwe\u2019ve got the sort of people who elect\nthemselves to look after finances, or\n\u2018welfare\u2019. These are the people who run\ninformal team-building exercises like\nthey\u2019re the entrance exam for the fucking Delta Force. And in the incompetent corner, we\u2019ve got... well, you know\nthe sort. Like a bucket full of vomit\nperched on a unicycle; clumsy and un-stable, and every time there\u2019s a slip up\nyou get bile spraying everywhere.\nBest not to think too hard about\nthat one. The point is that a lot of the\nwork these people do does not need to\nbe done by a student. When you put\nthese tasks into a job description, it attracts the kind of person who wants to\ndo that sort of job. And unfortunately,\nthat class of person is a tosspot.\nHere\u2019s a neat example for you. On\nNovember 16th, the Student Council\nconvened and received reports from\nthe Sabbatical officers. These reports\ncontained several \u2018joke\u2019 passages\nwhich the Sabbs claim were to test if\nanyone reads their reports. You may\nnot remember this story - this is because it is entirely useless and devoid\nof any interesting content whatsoever.\nIt made the news pages of CGCU site\nLive!, though, and there was the usual\nmuted bitching in the comment thread\nfor it. But no-one took any notice, and\nno-one\u2019s complained about it. Why?\nBecause it\u2019s about as interesting as a\ndinner date with a marine biologist.\nLet\u2019s take another one. Not that I\u2019m\nsingling anyone out here, but when\ncertain CGCU officers royally fucked\nup the situation regarding their ball\nearlier this term, there were clear examples of atrocious leadership and de-cision-making, as well as a neat round\nof pass-the-buck with everyone for the\nevent. But the stupidity came to a peak\nwhen Kirsty Patterson responded to\na page full of criticism in felix with a\nfucking poem. It\u2019s a good poem, don\u2019t\nget me wrong. I like poetry, and I like\nthat one. But you can\u2019t pay for bail with\nan impromptu session of interpretive\ndance, and you can\u2019t dismiss allegations of fuckwittery with a poem.\nBut the really great bit is that everyone let her get away with it. You know\nwhy? Because we were too busy reading Hangman that week in felix. Noone gives a toss, whether these people\nsucceed or fail.\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good thing.\nI\u2019m saying it\u2019s a sign that the current\nsystem doesn\u2019t work. And so we come\nback to the only branch of the Union\nworth bothering with - this fine organ\nyou hold in your hands right now. Next\nterm, I\u2019ll be holding the Angry Geek\nIdol once again, where I encourage\nyou all to write a comment piece on\nweek to win cash money. If you want\nto make a contribution to the student\nbody, then write here. Because this is\nwhere it happens, this is where people communicate ideas and talk about\nwhat needs to be done.\nAnd that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say on that.\nExpecting a big festive themed comment piece for the final issue of term?\nGo submit a complaint to the Student\nCouncil about it. Merry fucking hum-bug, everyone.\nAngry Geek asks the Sabbs what the f*ck they do\n\u201cLike a bucket full\nof vomit perched\non a unicycle...\nbile spraying\neverywhere\u201d\nF\nreshers, I am very sorry to\ninform you that if you came\nto Imperial looking for promiscuity and an abundance\nof girls you have come to the\nwrong place. As for you girls looking\nfor the right man or just 30 minutes of\nfun (most of us men like to brag, but\nin reality we can\u2019t really even last that\namount of time) the odds are good, but\nthe good are odd.\nNow I\u2019ve scared you and got your at-tention. I am happy to inform all you\nstudents reading the felix, thinking this\npaper needs to be sexed up, that I am\nhere to do exactly this. Some of you\nmay call it a sex and the city column,\nI call it a column that gets you ready\nfor the weekend ahead (you know what\nI mean). But for this I need your help,\nI need you to write to me with all your\nproblems, that doesn\u2019t mean work\nrelated or soppy stuff about missing\nhome. I mean gritty stuff, page turning\nstories or even a little need for advice.\nBut don\u2019t worry, I mention no names.\nAnyway back to you freshers, and\nwhere better to start than Medics. Yes\nthat elusive group of people that stick\ntogether and you rarely see in halls.\nThey have stories of \u201ctapes\u201d on the in-ternet, activities in the back of lecture\ntheaters and at all of the medic bops.\nMedicine along with Biology are the\ntwo subjects here that have a pretty\neven split in the sexes, and if you are\never so lucky to be at a medic bop then\nyou may notice how many are gor-geous. I can hear you all thinking, yes a\nsolution to my unforced celibacy, an in-telligent, good looking girl to get with.\nWell if you are thinking this STOP. As I\nhave mentioned medics stick together\nand gossip like nothing else, after a first\ndate the entire of ICM would know,\nyour size down there, favorite position\nand all your hidden little secrets. Trust\nme I know. Plus they are workaholics\nand you know \u201ctheir course is sooo\nhard\u201d (bullshit, try EEE or JMC), so\nyou would be the second most important thing after their course. Vent over.\nSo what to do? If you\u2019re a boy, then\nthe odds are against you. I can see\nit now, 10 boys running in panic to\ncrowd around the nearest good looking girl, all trying to get her number.\nDon\u2019t, you\u2019ll only scare her away, as\nmy girlfriend says don\u2019t be clingy (I\njust call myself a romantic). If you\u2019re\na girl then it is very good or very bad,\nall depending upon your personal\nstandards. Don\u2019t let those standards\nfall, there are a few of us charming,\ngood looking, single men. John Mansir\nperhaps, or Mr Smith (he knows who\nhe is). They\u2019re gonna get me for that\nmention.\nOne piece of advice tho boys, a first\ndate, first kiss and first time tell a girl\neverything she needs to know. So you\nbetter push the boat out.\nI bet you\u2019re all thinking, who am I\nand why am I telling you these horrible truths? The answer is, do you really think I\u2019m going to tell you all? I\u2019d\ninvoke a world of embarrassment on\nmyself. I will tell you though, I\u2019ve been\nhere long enough and dated enough to\nknow a little. Plus I may be the only boy\nto have watched every episode of sex\nand the city; and no, that doesn\u2019t mean\nI\u2019m gay, I just know what you lot need\nto do. Think of me as a friendly, advice\ngiving hitch like character.\nImperial Hitch thinks you\u2019re undersexed\n\u201cLooking for the\nright man or just\n30 minutes of\nfun? The odds\nare good, but the\ngood are odd\u201d\nCan you rant, bitch or moan for 850 words? email: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk GAMES\nI\nt\u2019s clear now that casual gaming\nhas started to make a crack in\nhardcore gaming. While Facebook has now grown its gaming\nto the point where people are\ncalling it a \u2018platform\u2019, casual gaming\ncontinues to extend in the opposite direction with titles like Plants Vs. Zombies from Popcap games, released this\nyear to great applause and chuckles\nfrom the specialist media. While this\nbrand of gaming was originally reviled\nby the hardcore, it\u2019s now becoming\nclear that it\u2019s a compliment, rather than\ncompetition, for the games industry.\nGames like Plants Vs. Zombies and\nthe superb Musaic Box which took the\n\u201cExcellence In Design\u201d award at this\nyear\u2019s Independant Games Festival\nawards are showing that casual gaming\ndefines the mood of the player, not the\nweight of the game. Musaic Box\u2019s laid-back attitude to itself hid an innovative and engaging puzzle game where\nmusical compositions were broken\ninto jigsaws and had to be rearranged\nby placing pieces and listening to what\nyou had put down. No boss battles,\nand no levelling system, but still great\ndesign.\nSimilarly, Plants Vs. Zombies was designed to have strategic depth despite\nbeing a game where sessions could last\nfor a few minutes if desired. The \u2018tower\ndefence\u2019-style gameplay, now familiar\nto gamers thanks to a slew of the games\nPopcap have got two complete PvZ survival kits to give away.\nEach includes a copy of the game, a PvZ\nmousemat, a \u201cYour Grass Is Mine\u201d t-shirt and a small gardening kit, to make\nsure those pea-shooters stay in tip-top\nfashion.\nTo win, send an email to games.fe-lix@imperial.ac.uk with the subject line\n\u201cAlan Titchmarsh Wants My Brain\u201d,\nand tell us which plant you\u2019d use to\ndefend against zombie apocalypse, and\nwhy. The two entries that we deem funniest win!\nThe closing date for this, and all competitions from this issue is Tuesday December 15th at 6pm.\nWin! Plants Vs Zombies Complete Survival Kits\nover the last two years, was remixed with\na friendlier face and a kooky humour\nthat people immediately latched onto.\nI\u2019m also hoping that indie developers\nmight make the jump to casual-style designs in 2010 as a result. We\u2019ve already\nseen some very slick and accessible indie\nefforts this year. Perhaps next year will\nsee some crossover.\n2009 was a good year for casual games.\nMore of this sort of thing in 2010, and\nthe stigma people associate with FarmVille may vanish altogether.\n2009 in casual gaming\nBejeweled has sucked away the hours of many gamers, hardcore or otherwise\nT\nhe Internet is a means of\nexchanging data over a\nlarge international network of computers. You\nmay have heard of it. It\nturns out is has a great many uses,\nincluding \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the\ntransfer of financial and economic\ndata, the distribution of gentleman\u2019s\nreading material, and the consumption\nof electronic videogames material.\nToo far? Well, you might think it\u2019s a\nstupid way of talking about the inter-net, but 2009 has had a string of events\nthat make you wonder if we know what\nwe\u2019re doing with it any more. It\u2019s like\neveryone woke up on January 1st and\nlooked at all the wires coming out of\nthe back of the machine and had an\nepiphany.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that digital distribution is the platform for distributing PC\ngames nowadays, thanks to an enormously strong showing from Steam,\nDirect2Drive, GoodOldGames and\nother digital retails in 2009. With the\nconsoles now catching up, providing\nolder games for release in their own\ndedicated stores, and some limited\nnew releases too, it won\u2019t be long before we finally embrace the idea that\nstoring games digitally is the way to go.\nBut there have been some bizarre attempts to take the idea too far this year,\nthe most noticeable of which was the\nOnLive kerfuffle that kicked off earlier\nin the year, when journalists worldwide\nbecame convinced that we would end\nthe year by playing Crysis on our mobile\nphones at full tilt.\nWhoops! OnLive\u2019s idea \u2013 that gaming data could be computed off-site and\nstreamed into your living room \u2013 isn\u2019t a\nbad one. But the infrastructure for such\na service is so far off as to make it a fairytale right now.\nFor now, we\u2019d benefit more from unifying the way we store digital purchas-es. The Steam Cloud fiasco that very\nnearly got off the ground a few weeks\nago was all based around the idea that\nValve are putting too much of their\nSteam platform into digital releases,\nmeaning that other digital retailers are\nshut out from the process.\nIt might be boring, but digital retail\nhas got to the point now where it needs\nstandards and shared protocols. I don\u2019t\nneed to buy a special bookshelf for my\nPenguin books. There\u2019s no reason to\nchange things online.\n2009 in digital WTFs\nOnLive looks set to come back with huge funding in 2010. But will it work?\nFor the last couple of days I\u2019ve woken\nup at 6.45 to get an hour of MW2 in\nbefore uni. I need help. Mario\u2019s princess is redecorating her castle, Borderlands is still in the CD case, and Ezio is\nskulking in the shadows of Kensington\nGame waiting to be bought.\nWhy the hell am I racking up hours\nof MW2 gameplay when I could be\nalseep before work? It\u2019s because Infinity\nWard are evil. I\u2019m weak, I like collecting\nthings, and if you are going to give me little badges and keep giving me them, for\njust killing people, or even when I don\u2019t,\nShadow Complex is not the Game of\nthe Year. But being released in a year\nthat included Left 4 Dead 2, the zombies were going to overpower anything\nelse. Shadow Complex will just have to\nsettle with being absolutely brilliant.\nI should have hated it. It contains a\nfelix Games Of The Year\nwell, I\u2019m going to keep playing until I get\nthem all. I found all of Twilight Princess\u2019\ngolden bugs; I can burn as much time\ngetting a ton of pictures I\u2019ll never use.\nHaving said that, my favourite game of the\nyear was really Flock.\nThere\u2019s\nsomething\nhilarious\nabout aliens\nsquashing\ncows, pinball\npigs and loved up\nsheep...\nlitany of conventions seen time and time\nagain in contemporary games: collectables to lengthen the gameplay, percentage completion to lengthen the game-play, and of course, achievements! To,\nuh, compensate for the shortness of the\ngame. Surely I should have saved my MS\npoints for virtual hookers instead?\nBut no: gloriously high production\nvalues, a fluid control scheme, wonderful 2D platforming, fantastic graphics\nand a more-addictive-than-crack melee button. The last game I completed\ntwice was Super Mario 64. I\u2019ve finished\nShadow Complex four times. Shadow\nComplex is the most polished, unoriginal game I\u2019ve ever played, and even more\ncompelling than a vial of Boomer bile.\nIf I say the latest installment in the\never-expanding Grand Theft Auto se-ries, I bet the first title that comes to\nmind is simply GTA IV. You are wrong,\nI\u2019m afraid. My number one this year is\nGrand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars,\nwhich stands out this year for many\nreasons. For me, the DS has really\nbeen struggling recently for interesting games, and this Rockstar title was\na massive breath of fresh air. It makes\nuse of pretty cel-shading-style graphics\nand a nice 3D engine to display from a\nbird\u2019s eye view, which is very nostalgic\nfor players of earlier GTAs.\nFor once, it\u2019s GTA done right! With\ninteresting and varied missions, surprisingly entertaining mini-games and\nnone of that \u2018going out with friends\u2019\ngarbage, the series was really taken\nback to its roots and is simply more\nfun. By the end, I was left with one\nstriking conclusion which cemented it\nas my title of the year: this is the game\nGTA IV should have been.\nTristanAllwood Wise Man\nThomasRoberts Chief Elf\nSimonWorthington Cracker\nIt\u2019s been a good year for gaming. It\u2019s\nclear to see that whatever you game\non, 2009 delivered something superb\nfor you. Among the many, many games\nthis year spewed out, one in particular\nstruck a chord with me.\nTorchlight is the cover version Diablo 2 was waiting for. We don\u2019t get\nmany truly great games that rework an\nold concept so successfully, but with\nTorchlight we see every aspect that\nmakes a hack-and-slash RPG so great\nreflected upon, refined and remade in\na better, simpler or more engaging way.\nThe inventory system is improved.\nSpells work more fluidly in combat.\nThe drip-fed weapon upgrades edge\ncloser to that sweet spot of gaming ad-diction. It\u2019s visually clean, it\u2019s simple\nto control, it\u2019s everything a game of its\ngenre should be, and more.\nIt\u2019s the most exciting game I\u2019ve\nplayed all year. Go get it.\nMichaelCook Mince Pie\nRunic Games has Torchlight: to give\naway to you guys. Email: games.fe-lix@imperial.ac.uk telling us why\ncaves are awesome.

It\u2019s hard to say\nwhat exactly I love about is but\nI\u2019ll give it a shot.\nChristmas shopping is an experience in itself. I was on Oxford Street on the weekend \u2013 it was\nlike another world. Even though they\nhad closed the roads for the shoppers,\nthere were still people steadfastly using\nthe crossings, even going so far as to\nwait for the green man. And inside the\nshops, it got even worse/better! With\nthe population of a small country on\neach floor, we moved not as a group of\npeople but as one large amorphous be-ing, with shop assistants gently herding us towards the shinier and more\nexpensive products. When pressed\nintimately between an eight-year-old\nscreaming for the latest lego set and a\ngrandmother from Essex searching for\nthe perfectly stitched teddy bear, myself laden with toys, gifts, clothes and\na cornucopia of chocolate, I really felt\none with humanity. The connection\nwas as much spiritual as it was physi-cal. One caveat to this; never ever go\nto Hamleys.\nHowever, shopping was my secondary objective on Oxford Street; I really\nwent to see the Christmas lights. Upon\nleaving the Underground station, my\neyes turned heavenwards to the glittering displays of light and decoration\nsuspended above the masses. They\nwere magical, simply magical, and yet\nthey serve the same purpose as the\nsimple tinsel and fairy lights that adorn\nhouses across the country. Maybe it\u2019s\nbecause I (like many an Imperial stu-dent) have a mental age measured in\nsingle digits but just the sight of those\ntwinkling lights and displays is enough\nto lift even the most moribund of\nspirits.\nAdverts confuse me though. Long\nago, a primordial ad-agency made the\ntwin discoveries that people buy things\nthat they like, and that a lot of people\nlike naked women. Thus the strategy\ndeveloped that if you have a product to\nsell, you must drape it over a scantily-clad vixen (or vice-versa). But this has\ngone on for so long now that I find\nmyself largely desensitised to it all. A\nfriend had to point out to me that I was\nsitting inches away from Keira Knightley dressed in naught but a bowler hat\n\u2013 I honestly hadn\u2019t noticed. Conversely, it only takes a few seconds of those\nM&S food adverts to set me all aflame.\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the decadently thick\nchocolate sauce or the seductive tone\nof the voice-over but those adverts effortlessly get my salivary (among oth-ers) glands going. As a result, I tend to\nlook for women based not on the contents of their bra but their cookbook...\nwhich can get a bit awkward after a few\nbottles of mulled wine and a DVD of\nLove Actually.\nAnd after the shopping comes the\nwrapping! The joy I get out of meticulously measuring out lengths of gaudy\nyet diaphanous paper and enfolding\nit in the strangest of shapes is only\neclipsed by that which I feel on Christmas morn when I can, with primal\nabandon, rip it to shreds in a youthful\neffort to free the presents from their\nephemeral prisons. I\u2019m right in saying\nthat the wrapping is half the present.\nI\u2019ve known many a child who, when\npresented with the latest Nintendobox-station-360, has ignored it for a\ngood hour or more whilst held enraptured by the 99p wrapping paper it\ncame in. And don\u2019t get me started on\nall the ribbons and accessories!\nChristmas is coming and the goose\nis getting fat \u2013 but it\u2019s not the only\none! Christmas has a fine selection of\nfoods particular to the season. Sumptuous mince pies, warm from the oven,\nheartily washed down with a glass or\ntwo of mulled wine, all to warm the\nbelly...and the heart. And then there\u2019s\nthe Christmas Dinner. It doesn\u2019t matter how lean a family lives for the rest\nof year, or how many relatives come to\nvisit, it is a fact of life that there will\nbe so much food prepared that there\u2019ll\nbe turkey sandwiches for all well into\nJanuary.\nBut what I really like about Christmas is that for a small portion of the\nyear, people go out of their way to\nthink about others and do something\nnice for them. And I like to think this\nis what the guy who started the whole\nthing off was trying to get at, some two\nthousand years ago.\nSo, may I wish you all a Merry Christmas (or a Happy Winter Solstice, if you\nprefer) and a Happy New Year!\nRhys Davies wishes you a merry Christmas\n\u201cA friend had to\npoint out to me\nthat I was sitting\ninches away from\nKeira Knightley\ndressed in naught\nbut a bowler\n\n"
