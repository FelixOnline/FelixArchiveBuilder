    "content": "Letters\nStorm in\na Teacup\nDear Pallab\nWith reference to the\ncontinuing saga of the Bot/Zoo\ntea room, why is the Biology\ndepartment expected to\nsub sid is e what has always been\na facility used by people from\nall departments? Surely the\nUnion should be responsible for\nrunning the service in what is\nafter all a Union room.\nStudents at Imperial are\nbe ii j jg trained in technological\nskills vital to the future of British industry. If our so-called\nleaders cannot manage to run a tea bar between them what\n.hope is there for British\n; industry? If they do not feel up\nto this onerous task then they\nshould resign.\nYours sincerely\nJ Martin Taylor\nOne President\nto Another\nDear Pallab\nI have just been reading\nGaynor's letter of 8/11/83 on\nNicaragua, and I think it's actually quite good. What\nworries me much more is the\nuse of the word 'literally' in that\nweek's issue of FELIX. If one of\nmy PR men did that I would\nliterally chop his balls off. I think that what Mr Peter\nRodgers must have meant to\nsay was 'unilaterally wiped the\nfloor with the speakers'.\nYours very very sincerely\nPresident of the USA\n(Name and address supplied)\nTaken\n'Literally'\nI am writing concerning the\narticle appearing in your\nmagazine of 1\n1 November. It\nappears that students of\nImperial College are quite\nblatantly coming j nt0 my\npremises and are using the word\n'literally' with neither prior\nconsultation of my staff, nor\nreturning the word after its use.\nI would point out that\nSainsburys has a very limited\nsupply of this word and if\npeople do not discontinue using\nit immediately. I shall be forced\nto take immediate legal action\nagainst of fencers. Yours irately\n(and literally)\nPeregrine Sainsbury\nStore Manager\nRefectoryBoycott\nDear Sir\nI wish to inform you that\nsince no one else is organising a refectory boycott, / shall be\nboycotting the refectory myself\nfrom Monday 28 November.\nYours sincerely\nSteven Groome\nPhysics PG\nPS: Do the union exec have any\nimagination?\nMore\nWallys\nDear Pallab\nI have long known that there\nare some real wally s at IC, but\nNeil Martin's letter of two weeks\nago really scaled heights of\ninanity! I am, of course,\nreferring to his assert ation that\nthe Government has \"already\nmade the decision to shoot the\nunarmed Geenham Peace\nWomen if they get in the way\".\nThe truth of this matter is\nthat, in an attempt to\nmanufacture controversy, a Labour MP asked the Defence\nSecretary to give an assurance\nthat no so-called 'Peace\nWomen' would be shot if they\npenetrated the secure zones\nwithin the Greenham base, a statement that he knew Mr\nHeseltine could not make. The\nquestion was quite disingenuous, since the challenger\nwas well aware of i he, strict rules\nof engagement followed by the\nsoldiers guarding all Military\ninstallations (rules which this\ngovernment has not changed)\nrules which, indeed, were in\nforce under the last Labour\nGovernment. Perhaps they\nwere Fascists too!\nYours scathingly\nHerr Richard Monkhouse\nBlatant Untruths\nDear Pallab\nIt just makes me wonder to\nthe credibility of FELIX when\nit prints letters which contain\nblatant untruths. I refer of\ncourse to last week's letter from\nAlison B Mew extolling the\nvirtues of RSMU.\nHow she claims to be 'setting\nthe records straight' is certainly\na travesty, and all that follows\namounts to propaganda.\nAlthough she claims to be a* member of RSMU she seems far\nremoved from the reality of that\nunion.\nAnyone who has read RSMU's own publication following the\nlast UGM will see the absurdity\nof her claims. In an article\nentitled 'Hon Porn Night' the\nmines block vote is recognised\nand actively promoted.\nThe voting at the UGMs was\nhandled rather ineptly. This has\nbeen used in argument against\nthe validity of the result, but\nwhat must be remembered is the\nway in which the mass exodus\n(and subsequent return) of\nminers was responsible for this\ndegeneration of order.\nThe final outcome, however,\nshows a certain credibility, as it\ncorrelates well with the voting\non the amendment (both in the\nmargin and the number of votes\ncast).\nThe porn motion was passed\nby members to whom this issue\nis of direct concern and who\ncare for their Union's credibility. All these people are\nextremely fed up with Ms Mew\nand her like in R SMU perpetuating the image they\nthink Imperial College Union\nshould have. The result of the\nvoting speaks for itself!\nJohn Sattaur\nPhysics 3\nIN Z. EE NM^E OV\nRISERSC.HZ.

    "content": "IC V6 vs KCH II 1\nFollowing a bleak week in Europe Bobby\nRobson finally had something to smile about\nlast Saturday. Dave Bradley, a traditional\ncentre-forward from Barnsley, scored a hattrick for IC fifths to consolidate their mid-table position. All scored in the second half,\nthe most impressive was the second which\nDave struck whilst lying flat on his back on\nthe six yard line, the shot going in off the\nunderside of the bar. Other scorers were Neil\nMcManus and John Kerendi who got two,\nprompting captain Julian Westcott to say 'It\ncame like a bolt from the blue, I went rigid\nwhen John scored'.\nFELIX\nFOOTBALL\nAfter our warm up 10-1 victory, the all-stars\nhad moulded into a fluent football machine,\ncapable of beating just about anybody except\nperhaps Blackpool FC.\nOur strategy was simple. We kept the ball\nin the air, knowing that the Ents poof ter s wouldn't dare head the ball in case they\nruined their hair does! The perils of pretending to be hip. With Pallab playing and the\nsuperhero Sports Editor John Scott in the\nside, the hapless Ents team were always going\nto be in for a damn good thrashing. Trouble\nwas, the perverts enjoy a good beating. Matt\nthe Cat's goal was as safe as the Bank of\nEngland. The Ents forwards tried until they\nwere blue in the face, but they were only ever\nany good at posing.\nIf John Motson had been watching, he'd have had an orgasm at the sight of the rampant Felix forwards running circles round the\noutclassed opposition, scoring 14 goals without reply. Oh, by the way, the Sports Editor\nscored 9 of these goals, just thought I'd mention it in passing\nBlackheath 'A lot' v IC 'Not Too many'\nAs Dave McGee's 'boys' jogged out of the\nchanging rooms on to the dust bowl, that\nBlackheath call a rugby pitch, and saw the\nopposition's muscle bound backs rapidly approaching the speed of sound during their\nwarm up sprints, whilst casually flicking the\nball to one another across the pitch, it became\napparent that the match to follow was not\ngoing to be a barrel of laughs.\nIn fact this almost premonition ary feeling\nof 'this is a fucking stupid idea' was apparent\nas early as.9:15 when the team started to\nassemble in Beit Quad. Due to the All Blacks\nmatch in the afternoon, the kick off had been\nbrought forward to a ridiculously early lime,\nwhich resulted in the usually lively banter and\ngeneral joie de viv re being replaced by the pale\nface and pity ful groan of the hangover.\nNot even the efforts of Pete Hardie could\nraise the li der enthusiasm to the required\nlevel, and so, as lambs to the slaughter,\nImperial were soundly thrashed by a team\nwho were, bigger, stronger, faster, fitter and\nmore skilful.\nHowever, not everyone played particularly\nbadly. Mark Hassell kicked a very nice\npenalty, and Miles Thompson gave an\nimpressive display of tactical kicking,\nculminating in the one over the stand and into\nthe greenhouse. Alas, his efforts were in vain,\nthe ball was retrieved and the tide of\nBlackheath attacks continued until the final\nwhistle.\nEven allowing for the early kick off and the\nteam being depleted by wim pings out, this\nwas definitely a lack lustre performance. So\nwhat was wrong?\nDid the team need Dave McGee to tell\nthem that 'this is the one boys'?\nShould more Tango have been consumed\nbefore the kick off?\nWere too many people trying to identify\nthe colony of fungus on Jason's shorts?\nOr, had the changing room air been so\npoisoned by the noxious gases emerging from\nMark Hassel's bowels (gases so dense, that it\nwas a miracle they weren't visible!) that any\nphysical activity was severely hampered?\nAnyway, England beat the All Blacks, thus\n'providing the necessary excuse to drink some\nbeer'.\nGutteridge Cup\nIC 36 Guys Hospital 0\nIC went through to the semi-final of this\ncompetition with a devastating win over\nGuys. The IC forwards tore into the\nopposition from the start and Guys spent the\nfirst twenty minutes mainly on the floor on\nthe receiving end of some ferocious ruc king. Points were quick to come under this pressure\nand at half time. IC were 20-0 up.\nIn the second half the team continued to\nperform and Guys ended up 36 points down at\nfull-time. Tries came from Steve Philips,\nSteve Thompson, Andy Ralph (2), John\nExley, John Wuirr and some other players.\nMark Hassle kicked the conversions and\npenalties.\nBy full time the supporters and substitutes\nhad fallen over under a heap of Swan cans.\nThanks to all those who came along.\nNo-one won the 'Spot the Ball' competition\nas it was a trick question and the ball was, in\nfact, out of the plane of the page.\nICSC vs Kent Won 2-0\nLast weekend the team travelled to a gravel\npit near Cantebury to sail Kent.\nThe Imperial team took to the water with\ntheir usual enthusiasm and left Kent sorting\nout the remainder of the boats on the shore.\nAs this was going to be hard fought match, IC\nhad decided that a pre-race practice session\nwas required and disappeared to the far end\nof the lake to try out some new manoeuvres.\nThe team were soon improving their roll\ntacks in the light airs, and practicing some\nsophisticated team racing tactics to try and\n'psyche-out' Kent before the start. However\nKennedy was trying to be too coo! with his\nroll gybes and, much to the amusement of\neveryone else, managed a complete body\nimmersion before the first start. He capsized.\nKingston Small Boat Head\nAt the crack of dawn last Sunday morning\nmembers of the Boat Club senior squad set\nout in search of glory in distant Kingston. The\nfirst division of the Kingston Small Boat\nHead started at 9:00am and was held over a2'/2 mile course on the Thames at Kingston.\nThe main aim of the IC crews was the defeat\nof some crews of the British National squad\nwho were competing as part of a trials week-end.\nIn all Imperial College won seven events\nincluding the two fastest cox ed four times\neach winning the Senior A and U23 sections\nrespectively. The third fastest four was from\nOxford University and included two of last\nyear's winning boat race crew.\nIn the pairs event, the fastest two of the IC\npairs, of Griffiths and Downing, and O 'Brien\nand Hunt came 1st and 2nd in Senior A cox less pairs, both beating several of the\nBritish squad pairs. Steinlechner and\nBowden, the fresher s pair was 3rd fastest and\nwon the tankards for the Senior B section.\nThe dynamic duo of Wells and Hartland\nwon the Under-23 cox less pairs section with a devastating row beating the only other crew\nentered, the fifth IC pair of Harding and\nThorp, by ten seconds. Both pairs had some\ndifficulty with equipment failures!\nIn last week'snail biter the Cricket Club fell\ninto a ditch.

Bell was replaced at slip by the\nskipper himself, whose accompanying grasp\nof anglo-saxon syntax amazed all around\nhim. However the intrepid skipper in the next\nover proceeded to break a finger, diving at\nfirst slip for a wide ball bowled by Bell!?\nWill the word'enema' be mentioned two weeks\nrunning?\nWill anyone read the article to find out?\nFind out in next week's exciting episode.\nFELIXl Friday, 25 November, 1983i Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Welfare]\nFREE NHS PRESCRIPTIONS, DENTAL\nTREATMENT AND GLASSES.\nAlthough students are not automatically entitled to free pre-script ions, dental treatment and\nglasses, most students can get\nthem free on the grounds of low\nincome.\nDuring Term Time\nEligibility to these benefits is\nbased on your weekly income.\nThere are two ways in which the\nDHSS can treat the student grant\nfor these purposes, with the latter\nbeing the most common and the\nmost likely to afford eligibility.\nThe first is to deduct the\nvacation, travel and books and\nequipment elements from the\ngrant and then divide the remaining amount by 30 weeks to get a term time figure. The second is\nsimply to assume the basic grant\nto be roughly equal to the single\nperson's rate of supplementary\nbenefit. People receiving supplementary benefit have what is\nknown as an 'automatic right' to\nfree prescriptions, dental treatment and glasses, so unless the\nstudent has any additional income such as a scholarship which\ntakes their income above the\nsupplementary benefit level, they\nwill be eligible to reclaim charges.\nFortunately, individual students need not worry about\nthese calculations as questions\nconcerning your weekly income\non the claim forms for these\nbenefits can be sufficiently answered by stating that you are a full-time student living on a studen; grant. Any additional\nincome should be declared and in\nthe case of scholarships you\nshould make it clear how many\nweeks the money is supposed to\ncover so that the DHSS can\ncalculate your income properly.\nHowever, to quote one DHSS\nofficial to whom I spoke recently\n\"We don't usually take much\nnotice of what's on the form, we\njust pay them.\"\nFalling ill can not only be miserable but expensive\ntoo. Karen Stott, Student Services Officer,\nattempts to ease the pecuniary agony by writing\nabout the tricks of the trade in the ill health game.\nDuring Vacations\nDuring the short vacations the\nposition is much the same as in\nterm time except that in the case\nof undergraduates the weekly\nincome figure is lower, thereby\npossibly extending eligibility to\nsome whose incomes may be too\nhigh in term time. As there is no\nelement in the undergraduate\ngrant to cover the summer\nvacation those who do not find\nvacation work are eligible to sign\non for supplementary benefit. As\nmentioned above this will give\nyou the 'automatic right' to free\nprescriptions, dental treatment\nand glasses. If you have the\n'automatic right' simply tell your\ndentist or optician and ask them\nto arrange the forms for you. For\nprescription charges, get a receipt\nwhen you pay the charge and take\nit to your local DHSS who will\ngive you a refund.\nCapital\nThere is a capital limit of \u00a32,500\non these benefits so you will not\nbe eligible for any refund if your\nsavings and other capital exceed\nthis figure.\nPrescriptions\nPrescriptions now cost \u00a31.40 per\nitem so it is worth investigating\nyour entitlement. Don't wait\nuntil you need a prescription, get\nform PI 1 now and apply for an\nexemption certificate. If you are\nsuccessful in getting a prescription exemption certificate on the\ngrounds of low income, this will\ngive you the 'automatic right' to\nfree dental treatment and glasses.\nOne of the main difficulties here\nis the length of time taken by the\nDHSS to assess your claim. It is\ntherefore quite likely that you\nmay need a prescription before\nyou received your exemption\ncertificate, In this case get a receipt when you pay the charge\nand send the receipt with a covering letter to the DHSS\noffice dealing with your PI 1.\nIf your claim is refused and you\nthink you may need a large\nnumber of items on prescription\nover the next few months then it\nmay be worth getting a prepayment certificate. These cost\n\u00a37.50 for four months and \u00a321.50\nfor a year and they cover any\nnumber of prescriptions needed\nin that period. To apply get form\nFP95 from your local chemist,\npost office or DHSS.\nDental Treatment\nDental charges can only be\nclaimed back for treatment available under the National Health\nService. No help is available for\nprivate treatment. The Student\nServices Office and the Health\nCentre have lists of dentists\nwilling to provide NHS treatment\nto students, but it 'is always\nadvisable to check with the\ndentist that the work s/ he intends\nto do can be covered under the\nNHS or you could end up facing a substantial bill.\nSome dentists will arrange the\nreimbursement of costs for you,\nmost will expect you to pay the\ncharge yourself and claim it back.\nAsk the dentist for form FID, fill\nit in and send it with a receipt for\nthe charge to your nearest DHSS\noffice.\nFor those not eligible the most\nyou should have to pay for a course of routine dental treatment under the NHS eg fillings, is\n\u00a313.50 and for a course of non-routine treatment (including\nFREE ENTITLEMENTS CAT AGO RIES Prescriptions\nDental\nTreatment\nglasses milk and\nvitamins\nExpectant Mothers yy y Nursing Mothers > / y Women who have had a baby\nin the last year Jy Children under 5yrs with approved nurseries, play groups yyyy Children under 16 years yy y Young people under 19 years\nstill in full time education\nyy Page 6| I Friday. 25 November, 1983]\ncrowns, bridges and dentures) is\n\u00a395.\nGlasses\nAs with dental charges free\noptical treatment can only be\nclaimed for work available under\nthe NHS.

Their tense, energetic\nrock/pop is hard to categorise: the\nsharp melodies and offbeat paranoia\nare remi scent of early Talking Heads\nalthough this belies a satirical humour\nmore akin to Devo whilst front man\nSteve Skinnies rapid behaviour should\nhave him confined to a straight jacket.\nMinor classics to watch out for\ninclude The Shining (based on the film\nof the same name), Opportunity\n(rumoured to have been a Polydor\nsingle although the band admitted\neven they couldn't get hold of a copy)\nand the reflective Women at the Bus\nStop.\nTonight is a chance to see a fresh,\nexhilarating band before they have a chance to discover 64 track studios,\n12\" extended club mixes and Swiss\nbank accounts.\nJon Cottom\nPoet's Corner\nAttila the Stockbroker, alias John Opposition, the 'Sounds' writer, is a ranting poet with rather extreme left-wing tend an cie s. He is also extremely\nfunny and talented. You may not have\nguessed, but he actually used to be a stockbroker! His disgust towards\nstockbrokers etc is reflected in Death\nin Bromley a poem about the very\nsmall difference between dead\ncommuters and live commuters. Other\npoems to listen out for are the classic\nRussians in MacDonalds, The Oracle\nwhich is a \"tale oH or tu red testicle\",\nFlappin' in the Wind a very funny piss-take of the long-mac brigade to the\ntune of the Bob Dylan song and Hands\noff our Halibuts an ode to Captain\nKirke which contains more abuse than\nany other song I 've ever heard! How\nabout You slimy, shitty, Froggy, scum,\njust stick your trawler up your bum,\nfor starters. Finally, I must mention his\ngreatest moment, the hysterically\nfunny Willie Whitelaw's Willie, which\nnever fails to bring the house down. I can't confr im this, but apparently \"You\nwill never see anything quite as silly as\nWillie Whitelaw's Willie\". He really is\nworth seeing, and his album Ranting\nat the Nation (more poems about flat\nfish and Russians) is also worth a listen.\nJohn Scott\n\"This is the hottest I 've been since the\nSex Pistols\" shouted Mark Burgess at a recent Chameleons gig in Soho's Marquee Club. The truth is the\nChameleons owe more to the spirit of'79\nthan that first bleak winter of punk seven\nyears ago. Their sound is an amalgam of\nthe thrusting vitality of U2, the dense\nbass notes of Echo and the Bunneymen\nand Joy Division when they rocked on\nUnknown Pleasures.\nThis is understandable as the second\nwave started in their home territory of\nthe North West (Manchester in\nparticular). However the latest manifestations of this new wave, Big Country\nand the Alarm, have added their own\nideas to the original, the Chameleons\naim has been true.\nAlthough the band currently lack the\none song to focus their abundant energy\nand enthusiasm they're doing very well\non the live circuit\u2014they were able to sell\nout the Marquee with a crowd of loyal\nfans who knew the names of all the\nsongs when the band asked what to play\nnext. Split in Two was what everyone\nwanted to hear and although I thought\nTrick of the Light was much better it took\nall my will power not to shout for / Will\nFollow.\nThe only major criticism of the band is\nthe over-re lai ance on building up a crescendo (kicking up a storm in\njournalese) and then abruptly stopping\nfor the vocalist to sing plaintively over\nthe gently throbbing bass and jangling\nguitar.\nThe band are on Statik and have an\nalbum Script of the Bridge on release.\nPeter Rodgers\nFELIX Friday, 25 November, 1983 Page 5\n\n"

This latest \u00a3 7 7 0 , 0 0 0\ncock-up really does take the biscuit. Tiles were seen falling off\nthe Electrical Engineering building over six years ago. Only\nnow has work begun on it.\nThe delay is probably due to the bureaucratic inefficiencies\nand lack of communication we have come to expect from\nCollege Administration. Maybe the building might have been\nrepaired sooner had the eye sore been vis able from Sherfield.\nI think that after years and years of mistakes, poor\ndecisions and inefficiency on the part of the Estates Section,\nthe Rector should seriously consider the performance of the\npeople in charge.\nBot Zoo\nAt last students at Imperial College are beginning to question\nlofty decisions taken from on high.\nThe Botany Zoology Common Room used to be\nimmensely popular with everyone in the department. Despite\nthis, it was closed to save 0.25% of the department's budget.\nIf the tea room is not reopened when every single member of\nstaff and all the students have expressed their wishes so\nstrongly then it makes you wonder whether student\nrepresentation amounts to bugger all at this place.\nRag\nWith people turning up in their hundreds to Rag events and\nover \u00a3 3 0 0 0 being raised for charity, this must be one of the\nmost successful Rag Weeks ever.

They fire\nsingle shots in turn, and continue to fire in the\nsame cyclic order until two of them are dead. With\neach shot, the man firing may aim wherever he\npleases. All three know that A is 100% accurate, B is 80% accurate and C is 50% accurate.\nIf all three adopt the best strategy, and no-one is\nkilled by a wild shot not intended for him, who has\nthe best chance of surviving , and what are the\nprobabilities of each of the three men winning?\nGood luck, everyone.\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1pm on Wednesday, please. \u00a35\nfrom Mend-a Bike for the randomly selected\nwinning entry.\nLast Week's Puzzle.\nThe numbers are all the number 15, written in\ndifferent bases. The first is 15 in base 15, the\nsecond in base 14, etc. down to the last which is\nfifteen in base 1. The missing number is therefore\n15 in'base 3 which is 120. Many people have voiced\ndoubts about base 1, but it is correct and I 've seen\nit done in puzzles before.\nThis was harder than the last two, and the\nnumber of correct solutions was down to 21.

Felix TO 1 OF 1 ERIAL COLLEGE U PHEW!\nWHAT A PHONE\nBILL\nSurprised Union officials reacted\nstrongly to the news that in future\nUnion phone calls may have to be\npaid for from the Union Subvention\nfrom college.\nThis is just one of the many\npossible changes caused by the\nreplacement of the present dual\ntelephone network (separate\ninternal and external phones)\nwith a new computerized single\nphone system.\nThe old outdated telephone\nnetwork has been under review\nsince 1976, but due to the cost of\nreplacement, then estimated at\nover one and a quarter million\npounds, the plan was shelved.\nSince then the price has dropped\nto three quarters of a million\npounds. British Telecom has\nnow been contracted to supply\nImperial College with the new\nsystem by the start of next\nsession.\nWork is starting in February,\nbut no disruption to the present\nsystem is anticipated until\nAugust, as the new network will\nbe developed in parallel, leaving\nfinal connections until the last\nmoment. College expects to save\nat least \u00a350,000 a year through\nlower running costs, and despite\nthe need to lose over half the\nstaff running the present switch-board, assurances have been\ngiven that no redundancy\nnotices will be served.\nThe new exchange, while not\npresenting anything particularly\nnew in exchange technology\nnevertheless represents a major\nstep forward for Imperial\nCollege. The new system will be\nable to carry data from word\nprocessors and computers, a facility unavailable on the\npresent network. Internal phone\nContinued on page 3\nN0.659 \u2022 HH BM TEA'S UP! There was an overwhelming\nresponse to the call for a Bot Zoo\ntea-in yesterday morning. About\nthree hundred and fifty people\nturned up to show their support for\nthe reopening of the tea-room,\nwhich has been shut since April.\nProfessor Wood, Life Sciences\nHead of Department, was\nunable to attend, but sent a letter\nexpressing his regrets, for being\nabsent, and offered to see a delegation next week.\nTim Wilson, Life Sci. Dep.\nRep., hoped that this demons tr tion would make Professor\nWood think again about finding\nmoney for the tea-room. He was\nhowever doubtful about getting\nthe tea-room opened for both\nmorning and afternoon tea, but\nhoped to see limited opening in a few weeks time.\nThe sticking point seems to be\nProfessor Wood's in sistance that\nthe tea-room be self financing.\nMr. Ian French who used to\norganise the tea-room, felt that\nthis would make the tea-room\nunworkable in its previous\ninformal and relaxed manner. A Hordes of thirsty\nqualified person would be\nneeded to keep the books and\naudit the accounts.\nThe closure of the tea-room\nhas left a social vacuum in the\ndepartment. Previously up to\n250 students and lecturers were\nable to relax between lectures\ndrinkers at the 'Tea-in'\nthere in a friendly environment.\nPeter Burt organiser of the\nprotest would like to thank the\nkitchen staff, and all those who\nmake this event possible, raising\n\u00a330 for Rag, and opening the\ndoor for further negotiations.\nEstates Slated in Tiles Fiasco\nThe College has been loaned\n\u00a3770,000 by the UGC to carry out\nlong overdue repairs to the tiles on\nthe exterior of the Electrical\nEngineering Building. The additional scaffolding which was\nerected three months ago is\nexpected to remain at least until\nMay whilst loose tiles are removed\nand new cladding sheets are\ninstalled.\nIt became apparent more than\nsix years ago, shortly after the\nbuilding was put up, that all was\nnot well with the tiles. Several\ncame loose and some even fell\noff, so protective shields were\nerected in 1977 to prevent tiles\nhitting people on the head. The\nCollege has been involved in a legal action against the builders\nsince the problem became\napparent, and final judgement is\nnot expected for another year at\nleast. The College needs to have\nthe work carried out in order to\nknow the cost of the repair\nwhich it then hopes to recover\nfrom the builders through the\ncourts. The UGC has agreed to a special loan to pay for most of\nthe necessary work in the first\nplace.\nThe question remains as to\nwhy the College have waited\nuntil now to start the work. It\nwas widely thought that they\nwere waiting for the legal action\nto be completed first, but it now\nappears that the legal action\ncannot be completed until after\nthe work has been carried out. In\nthe meantime there has been the\nannual cost of hiring the protective scaffolding for six years, and\nthe presence of an ugly eye-sore\nin the middle of College.\nThe reasons for the delay are\nunclear, but reasons offered such\nas that deterioration has only\nrecently made the work nec ess ary, or that the delay is due to\nCouncil planning hold-ups left\nexperienced observers of the\ncollege administration unconvinced.

    "content": "Beer Money for students\nA threatened increase'in the price\nof a pint in College bars has been\naverted at least until Christmas\nthanks to timely action by\nDeputy President Christine\nTeller.\nThe Refectory Committee\nplanned to pass on a two pence\nper pint price increase from the\nbrewers directly to students, as\nhas long been their policy,\nregardless of the financial\nposition of the bars.\nA well informed source\nreported that Victor Mooney,\nrefectory manager, whose loss-making operations are sub sidi sed by the bars, was a supporter of\nthe planned increase.\nHowever, Miss Teller argued\nthat discounts obtained last year\nhad not been passed on, and that\nthe bar accounts were in such a mess that the financial necessity\nof the increases could not be\nproved. She insisted on a full\nreview of bar financing before\nincreases were introduced and a review of the policy of\nautomatically passing on\nincreases.\nLondon Student\nElection Fiddle\nAllegations of electoral\nmalpractice have resulted from\nthe re-opening of the nominations for the post of editor of the\n'London Student' newspaper.\nThe UL U Vice-President, Kim\nWhite, mistakenly closed the\nnominations a day early with\nonly one candidate having been\nnominated. When the error was\nrealised the election of this\ncandidate was declared invalid\nand nominations re-opened\nallowing 'London Student' hacks\nwho had missed the original date\nto get their names put forward.\nThe single candidate org in ally nominated Michael George of\nKings College, described the\nevents as a left-wing manoeuvre\nto prevent the election of an\neditor who represented the views\nof London students.\nMarch Keeps Going\nTill December\nThe Rector of the Royal College\nof Art, Lionel March, is still\nclinging to his post despite his\nresignation in July. It was thought\nthat his successor would be\nappointed quickly and that he\nwould then step down, but the\nCollege has been dragging its feet\nin interviewing potential\ncandidates and there are now\nmoves to reinstate him.\nThe RCA is presently a hot bed\nof controversy and dissent, not\nleast over the Albert Exhibition\nwhich is losing money heavily.\nBut the deep-rooted problem is\nthe professional power blocks\nwho make the college almost\nungovernable since they are able\nto do pretty much as they like\nincluding, it is rumoured, a lot of\nprivate work in college time. The\nresult of this is that the RCA has\nattracted attention from the DES\nresulting in larger cuts than might\notherwise have been expected.\nCND Shocker\nRuddock Romps Home\nOne of the Debating Society's major meetings of this session\ntook place on Tuesday evening\nwhen Peregrine Worsthorne,\nAssociate Editor of the Sunday\nTelegraph and Joan Ruddock,\nCND Chairman, were the main\nspeakers for and against the\nmotion tha) 'CND undermines\nour deterrent and thereby\nthreatens the peace and defence\nof this country'.\nMech Eng 220 was only half\nfull as Mr. Worsthorne professed\nthe belief that although CND's proposals were admirable, they\nwere dangerous to the security of\nNATO and Britain. Mrs\nRuddock opened by remarking\nhow little had changed since she\nwas at IC, including FELIX's inaccurate reporting, then went\non to condemn the arms race\nand defend CND's role in trying\nto end it. The motion was\ndefeated by 78 votes to 27.\nNew Phones for Old\nContinued from front page\nusers will mourn the passing of\nmany of the antique phones\nlittered about college, as a quarter of the present phones are\ndue to be replaced. All phones\nwill be able to receive outside\ncalls, and selected extensions will\nbe able to dial out without\nhaving to go through the exchange staff as at present.\nWith the introduction of the\nnew exchange, the amount spent\nby individual users can be\nmonitored. The method of\npayment will have to be chan-ged. Instead of the present\nflat rate per phone system\nimposed on individual depart-ment s, each department will now\nbe res pons in ble for its own\nphone bill. This decentralisation\nof responsibility will mean that\nthe decision on whether to\ncontinue the present ban on\nmorning calls will be made by\nindividual departments. There\nwas some confusion as to\nwhether the the Union would\nhave to pay for its own phone\ncalls like departments, but it will\nbe easy for college to find out\nhow much is being spent on\nUnion calls.\nWhat is happening to the\nextension numbers is still\nuncertain, but it is likely that\nthere will be much confusion as\npeople get usd to the new single\nphone system.\nClub\nGrounded\nThe Hang Gliding Club has had a once in a lifetime opportunity\nturned down by the Union\nFinance Committee. The club\nwere offered an almost new\nmicro lite engine for \u00a3600, half the\nusual price. They needed extra\nmoney from UFC so that they\ncould still purchase a hang glider\nlater this year as planned, but\nnow they will almost certainly be\nunable to do this.\nIt was noted by some observers\nthat the sum requested by the\nclub was identical to the amount\nbeing spent on a weekend holiday\nfor three Union hacks in\nBlackpool (see last week's FELIX).\nFremantle\nRumours\nStudents living at the Fremantle\nHotel, a college head tenancy,\nhave been told by one of the\nsub wardens that the warden,\nAndrew Walker, is about to be\nsacked. However, all official\nsources refuse to confirm or deny\nthe story, with the Union and the\nStudent Services Office both\nrefusing to make any comment.\nIt seems that the prolonged\ncontroversy surrounding the\ncondition of the Fremantle and\nthe mistakes made during the\nsummer letting scheme, and the\ntreatment in FELIX of these\nmatters, is at last coming to a head. FELIX will have further\ndetails next week.\nHeave-Ho, Heave-Ho\nThe Guilds team dragging\nat the inter C CU tug-of-war\noverleaf.\ntheir heels as they lose to RCS\ncontest.

Who.\nannoyed by the reference last week to NG as\nteam l's star player, has been extolling his\nvirtues to me.\nUnder his captaincy Team 1 this week\nvanquished the team representing the rest of\nUL!! Not only that but recently, due to\nnegligible turnout by team mates, he took on\na whole team by himself and succeeded in\ngaining a creditable two games.\nHero worship sessions available on\nre qui est. AOB:\nTeam 3: no game this week. Pity as Wladek\nhas been looping well recently.\nTeam 4: Nigel and Gerson ventured forth\nalone, fearless of Trinity House YC and lost\nbut not without a fight. Leong, where are\nyou?\nTeam 5: Had a hard match this week. Well\nplayed Mark! 4-5 is not bad, especially versus\nthe Met.\nGraeme\nPS; Spot the ball had nothing to do with us.\nWe play on tables with small, white round\nones.\nSpot the bum! Another 'Womens Institute in\nScience and Technology' mass orgy.\nIC Ladies Rugby travelled North this\nweekend to play their first match of the\nseason against Keele University. Despite the\ninexperience of our team, not to mention the\nlack of players we did extremely well, holding\nthem off to a022 defeat.\nWe are very grateful to Adam, our long-suffering driver and two intrepid supporters\nwhose cheers and encouragement egged us\non. Thanks boys! We expect a better turn out\nat Harlington for our next ma'ch against\nQMC on 4 Dec\u2014so be there\u2014oi we'll send\nthe girls round!\nAnyone wishing to play in this match\nplease come to our practices\u2014we meet in Beit\nQuad at 12:45pm on Tuesdays and\nThursdays.\nWell done to all who played\u2014and better\nluck against QMC.\nIt' CO St Marys 58 (match abandoned)\nThe match was abandoned with seven\nminutes lo go since the situation on and off\ncourt was deteriorating beyond control. It all\nstemmed from the fact that St Mary's \u2022Official' was in fact one of their players, and,\nsurprise, surprise, was incredibly biased.\nWith this against us we still built up a twelve point lead by half time helped by a thirty foot shot from our imported guar cf right on half time (which even brough a smile\nto the lips of the 'Iceman'!). The only time St\nMarys got into the game was when their\nreferee helped them along.\nIn his debut match Panoyotis Stratinakis\nmade a three point play with his first touch at\nof the ball and then proceeded to get fouled\noff.\nTpp scorer was Scott Broderick (24 points).\nr Canoe Contrary to last week's editorial which\nsuggested that the canoeists would be towing\nthe skiers, we would like to point out that our\nidea of water skiing is for the canoeist to be\ntow td by the ski boat\u2014see photograph.\nCanoe Club: Anything for a bit of publicity.\n[Friday, 25 November, 1983\nIC 6th s vs St Marys 2nds:31 After being on top for much of the first\ntwenty minutes the sixths paid for a catalogue\nof missed chances when bac' marking on the\nIC left allowed the opposition to take the lead\nwith a cross shot past a pensive Akis in goal.\nHowever relief was to come before the\n.interval as quick thinking between Paul and\nColin put captain Dave clear to curl the ball\ninto the far corner with the keeper helpless.\nAfter the interval a stunned, Mary's defence\nstruggle to contain tl'e lively front three of\nPaul, Rick and Dave J. The breakthrough\neventually came as the opposition keeper\nstayed on his line for a low cross and Paul\nbrought his seasons tally to three, placing the\nball inside the far post.\nAfter a couple of scares at the back we\nwrapped up the points as Dave J left with just\nthe keeper to beat to put the ball into the roof\nof the net.\nto mom moMo mom momo mmm FEu x\\ "
