Adventure\nplaygrounds give kids from heavily built up areas a place of their own to play, meet their friends and develop in. As such they provide a necessary focus for these children. We\nlooked at many of the adventure playgrounds in London, the good and the bad. We chose Holly\nStreet because it is completely closed at the moment. A lot of work needs to be done, new\nstructures need to be built, a piece of waste land has to be dug over to make a garden,\nmurals need painting. The kids themselves will help too but tae res too much for them to do\non their own. Lets get Holly Street open for the children of Hackney again. We're all meeting under the Beit Archway at 10.30am on Saturday and Sunday morning or at Holly Street,\nHackney, E8 at 11.30am. Dress up warmly and bring a friend it' ll be lots of fun.\n\n"

That the advertising of the past\ntwo UG Ms has been sadly lacking\nand inadequate.\n2. On Monday 26 November, the\nfailure of the Exec News to\nappear.\n3. That these duties come under\nthe brief of the Hon Sec and/or\nPublicity Officer.\n4. That Union policy states that\nUG Ms must be given ten College\ndays (fourteen or idi nary days)\nnotice.\n5. That the quo racy of the U GM on\n6 November was successfully\nchallenged.\n6. That the absence of Exec News\nrestricted the activities of E AC(26 November).\nE AC Believes\n1. That the lack of publicity\ndivorces the Union from its\nmembership.\n2. That the absence of Exec News\ninhibits the efficiency and democratic running and debating\nof Union Affairs.\nE AC dislikes the attitude of the\nHon Sec in these matters.\nE AC Instructs\n1. The Hon Sec to pull his socks\nup.\n2. The Hon Sec to ensure that\nsuch publicity is produced according to Union policy.\nThis motion was passed nem con\nat E AC on 26 November and has\nbeen forwarded to FELIX for\npublication.\nJohn Passmore\nExt Affairs Officer\nDear Sir\nRecently various members of\nCollege have taken thoughtless\npleasure in throwing various\nitems of rubbish on Morphy Day,\nExec Torture and 'Rag Hit Squad'\noutings, at STOIC members while\nthey are operating the portable\nvideo recording equipment. We\nwould like to point out that if the\nequipment were broken, replacement would cost approximately \u00a31,500. We would\nthus appreciate people showing\nrespect for the equipment.\nYours faithfully\nBryan Steel\nHon Sec STOIC Sir\nYet again the RCS Boredom\nCommittee is on the rampage in\nFELIX correspondence.\nFrank James' latest strange\nhypothesis would seem to be that\nCC Us cause people to behave\nstrangely, hence people seek\nrefuge from strange behaviour by\nsocial ising with C CU types,\nwhereupon they are immediately\nleapt on (by homosexuals?) and\ndegraded so that they feel\ninclined to leave College.\nOn several occasions, I have felt\ninclined to leave IC forever. This\nseems to be a common feeling in\nMech Eng 2 - perhaps going some\nway to explaining the high 2nd year failure rates. As a primaeval\nbeing - that is a mere mortal - my\nbasic needs are:\ni. Food (preferably good food)\nii. Accomodation (preferably\ncomfortable, affordable and with\na reasonable degree of privacy, ie\nnot sharing a triple room).\niii. A soft, warm female.\nIf a freshman arrives at College\nand decides that Mooneys are\nawful, he doesn't like sharing a room in a seedy hotel with a total\nstranger and that he'd better tie a knot in it, we don't stand much\nchance of keeping the poor guy.\nI don't see ICU busting a gut to\nsolve any of these primary\nproblems of IC student life. Frank\nJames himself even managed to\nhelp lose University Challenge (if\nthis guy is so smart etc.)\nNow for an illogical change of\ntopic. Why shouldn't Steve\nHutching's letter to Colin Palmer\nbe published? We have been\ninundated with news about John\nShuttleworth suing ICU, so we\nshould be forewarned about the\nnext incredible waste of time,\nmoney and energy to come our\nway.\nSure it's the principle that\nmatters. The principle here is\nwhether it is worth standing on the\nletter of law for every mistake that\nanybody makes. If you drove\nthrough London without exceeding any speed limits, you\nwould be a rolling road block.\nJust why does Hutchings need\nhis back scratched by Watmough\nanyway? Surely the quality or\notherwise of his photographs\nshould speak for themselves. I seem to remember them as fairly\nunspectacular. As for Hutchings\nletter, I'd like to make him look\nsilly, but I think he's done well\nenough for himself.\nYours faithfully\nKen Strachan\nDear Sir\nI have studied the problem of\nthose students at IC who want\nabortion on demand in great\ndepth and have decided that they\nmay need to seek counselling\nadvice.\nTheir problem isn't uncommon\namongst abortionists. It begins\nwith their arithmetic inaccuracy.\nIn many of their publications they\nclaim that in Portugal 2,000\nwomen die each year from\nbackstreet abortions. The actual\nfigure for deaths from all causes\nof women aged 15-44 in Portugal\nin the most recent year for which\nfigures are available is 2,062\n(source: United Nations).\nTheir second problem is\nextreme self-centred ness leading\nto a belief that women have the\nright to destroy an individual to\navoid inconvenience to them-selves.\nTheir final problem is a desire to\nbe unpleasant to individuals or\ngroups of individuals that they do\nnot personally know, particularly\nRoman Catholics whom they\nportray as mindless morons.\nAllied to this is their exclusion and\nhatred of people presenting\ndiffer eing views. Most often this\nfeeling results from an inability to\nunderstand concepts that are\nderived from scientific facts.\nAbortionists who seek help with\ntheir problems might find the\nfollowing publications useful: A Doctor's Creed by Aleck Bourne;\nThe report of the European\nCommision of Human Rights on\nthe Bruggemann and Scheuten\ncase; The Decleration on the\nRights of the Child adopted by the\nUnited Nations.\nYours helpfully\nJ Stanley\nDear Ed\nIn a strange way Disgusted of\nTunbridge Wells is right. For\nmyself, as the Corrie Bill is close\nto my heart, I would like to see\nsomething done. The proper way\nis not through slang ing matches\nat UG Ms, but at Christmas tea\nparties, so I hereby invite Miss\nClark and crew to a discussion\nover mince pies. I suggest in the\nBot Zoo Common Room one\nevening, if she would contact me\nto arrange a time.\nLove\nJ Evans\nPhysics 1\nDear Sir\nI realise that a great deal will\nprobably be said about those who\nhelped at Carnival, but I felt that\nmy own band of helpers did such\nan incredible job, that I had to\nthank them directly for the effort\nthat they put in. So, Steve\nCarpenter, Anne Evans, Mary\nFreeman, Chris Geary, Lesley\nHorrocks, Jez, Mary Johiffe, Mary\nMorrison, Mika Nakimura, Sue\nNews on, Laurie Tomlinson, Melanie Vaughan, Diane Williams\nand of course Ian Taylor,\nTHANKS. Ruth Hildebrand\nAero 2\nDear Sir\nHaving been at Imperial College\nsince the beginning of October,\nand having listened to the 'Frank\nJames on CC Us' debate ever\nsince, it appears the problem is\none of maturity, or the lack of it, of\nstudents and their respective\nCC Us.I would suggest this is not\nthe fault of the student or the\nCC Us, but the fault lies in the\nsystem that allows direct entry to\n(any) university from the 6th form.\nThe choice of going directly to\nuniversity from one's6 th form\n(which is the majority case for\nmost prospective students) is, I feel, a soft option which allows the\nstudent to avoid the real world for\nan extra three or so years.\nThe solution, as I see it, is to\nstop direct entry and replace it\nwith compulsory deferment for\none, or preferably two, years.\nDuring this time away from the\neducation system, the potential\nstudent would have a greater\nopportunity to broaden his/her\nmind and come into contact with a wide range of people from all\nwalks of life (there is life beyond\nmining, engineering and science,\nactually). Also, working during\nthis one or two year's 'off is good\nexperience as it destroys any\nillusions that one may have about\nthe world outside of education\nbeing a nice, easy place to have to\nexist and consequently makes\nyou appreciate university more.\nBefore I'm shot down by anyone\nwho thinks I am old before my\ntime, boring etc, bear this in mind:\nmost, if not all, of my ex-work mates( yes, I was at work for\nover two years before joining\nImperial) show a maturity that few\nstudents I have seen attain, and\nyet are still able to enjoy\nthemselves down the pub, have\nfun and lead as full a life as\npossible without being BOR lN-G. They are also of the opinion\nthat some (not all) of the activities\nof the CC Us are \"pathetic\",\n\"moronic\" etc, although they do\nagree that the CC Us do some\ngood (I give them a balanced view,\nyou see).\nThus, to re-iterate what I said,\nearlier, it is not the students orthe\nCC Us who are to blame for their\nlack of maturity, it is the systems\nfault for not allowing them to\nattain it.\nYours sincerely\nSimon Jerome\nDear Sir\nThank God for the new\nexpensive tills in the refectories.\nOnce the cashiers have got the\nhang of them, and the queues are\nshortened (instead of getting\nlonger) diners can be out of the\nplace quickly enough to survive\nthe experience of the expensive\nfood.\nYours (Tunbridge Welled - No,\nthat wasn't me)\nMick Berry\n\n"

I arrived at the Rainbow\nexpecting to see the place about half-full, and was immediately struck by the\nnumber of people milling around in the\nfoyer.\nPromptly at eight, the first band The\nPassengers made their entry and started\npumping away, as usual, the bass was\nfar too loud, but otherwise all the songs\nexcept one reggae number(did not work\nat all) were thoroughly enjoyable as a warm-up for the main event. It was a shame that the lyrics were totally\nin dec i per able. Visually the band need a lot of improvement if they are going to\nbe worth seeing on stage. The lead\nsinger gave the impression that he was\nimitating Elvis Costello, whilst all their\nstage stances looked constructed and\nso awkward that they almost looked\ncomical. The strongest two songs were\ntheir single 'Two Lovers' and the one\nthey finished with 'Something About\nYou I Don't Like'.\nAt this point everyone shuffled out to\nget their half-pizzas and extortionate\nliquid malt in the fifteen minutes before\nInterview came on. I'd heard of this band\nsomewhere in the distant past and\nconsequently was expecting something\nrather good, however, I was to be\ndisappointed. The most entertaining\npart of their set was when the bassist\nbroke his guitar strap and endeavour ed to finish playing the rest of the song in a series of contorted positions.\nIn appearance, and the way they\nmoved about on stage, Interview could\nhave been some of the relics of the punk\nmovement, but musically they could not\nhave been much further removed. I found them quite boring. The songs they\nstrung out by including long instrumental passages inbetween the\nsinging, whilst the vocalist ambled\naimlessly about the stage trying to look\nas though he was enjoying himself. It\nwas just as well that the audience had\nreverted to throwing darts to keep\nthemselves entertained, throwing them\nback gave him something to do.\nEventually Interview finished, and let the rest of us stagger out for our, by now,\nwarm and uncomfortable seats.\nEverything had been running exactly\nto time so far and After the Fire\ncontinued in the same business-like\nfashion. After an interval of exactly\nfifteen minutes, whilst the safety curtain\nwas still down, the Thunderbirds theme\nplayed at Imperial for the lunch hour\nconcerts. The Mendelssohn concerto is one\nof the best known and best loved of concertos\nin all musical circles. Discrete interplay\nbetween soloist and orchestra is of course\nessential and care must be taken that the\norchestra does not simply accompany the\nsoloist but also complements her. Miss\nUdagawa and ICSO performed the concerto\nmagnificently. Although the strings were\noccasionally blurred and in the last\nmovement the wind players-had difficulty in\nmatching the soloist's cracking pace, it was\nnonetheless a striking performance and a credit to all those involved.\nThe orchestra completed the concert with\nthe second symphony in E minor by\nRachmaninov, an extended work requiring,\none would have thought, both skill and\nexperience among the players. This was an\nexciting and daring undertaking for the\nCollege orchestra and must have been a tremendous challenge to conductor and\nplayers alike. The symphony, written at the\nturn of the last century, abounds with rich and\nromantic melodies which are carried through\nthe string sections while the wind groups in\nrather a stark contrast pronounce urgent\ndemanding themes. However, the melodic\ncare of the work predominates throughout\nand the symphony ends triumphantly in a mood of optimism. Under the superb\ndirection of Richard Dickens IC Orchestra\ngave a creditable performance of a symphony\nwhich must inspire awe, even in the best\norchestras, with an admirable pe form ance by\nSally Donegari of the clarinet solo.\nFull congratulations should go to Richard\nDickens who has successfully created such a capable and enthusiastic amateur orchestra.\nI hope he remains with them for some time.\nSue McClaughry\ntune came over on the Disco and\nevidently (a lot of the audience must\nhave seen ATF before) this was the\nsignal for the crowd to erupt into\nraptures and rush to the front. The safety\ncurtain was raised revealing an\nempty stage, but for vacant drum kit and\norgan. Thunderbirds gave way to 'Joy', a track from their album, and the band ran\non the stage starting playing over the top\nof the disco.\nThe only criticism that can be raised at\ntheir performance was the lack of\nmovement, but this can only be\nexpected as two of the four were playing\nstationary instruments.\nThe fifty minute set came to an end\nremarkably soon, the band was called\nback for the obligatory encore and\nplayed 'Laser Love', then were called\nback again for a second encore with a jammed-up, very ATF version of the\nBeatles' 'Help'.\nI went to the concert expecting to hear\na very well played, boring version of\nAfter the Fire's LP. The quality of the\nsound was every bit as good as I expected, but the atmosphere was\nelectric, I 've rarely been to a concert\nwith such an exciting hum in the air. If\nyou missed them this time, you'll be\npaying a lot more next time around.\nChris Watts\n17\n\n"

    "content": "THE DEVILS\nNext Wednesday sees the opening\nnight of Dramsoc's latest production,\nTHE DEVILS by John Whiting.\nSet in the France of Louis XIII and\nCardinal Richelieu, it is based on\nhistorical events, as portrayed by\nAldous Huxley in The Devils of Loudon.\nThe story revolves around Burbain\nGrandier (played by Richard Jones of\nME1), a powerful, but lecherous\nmember of the high clergy.\nHis undoing, in more than one sense,\ncomes in the form of a young girl,\nPhillipe, daughter of the town prosecutor.\nParallel scenes involve a sister in a convent, who has never met Grandier.\nHowever, she hysterically claims he has\nde flowered her. She seems to represent\nrepressed sexuality, as the producer\nRichard King, an ex IC student put it:\n\"Has more hang-ups than Freud ever\nthought of.\"\nThe play was written in the early\nsixties shortly after the McCarthy era,\nand elements also of Miller's The\nCrucible are found.\nThe attitudes of the Bourgeorisie, as\nexemplified by the town's doctor and\npharmacist, to the decadence of\nGrandier are also interesting.\nOne member of the cast who will be\nfamiliar to many is Eric Jarvis, as\nCardinal Richelieu. It is rumoured he\nneeded special permission to emerge\nfrom his home in a broom cupboard,\nlocated somewhere in College!\nThe dress re hersal showed, assuming\nall goes fairly smoothly, that with\nfamiliar themes of sex and violence spun\ntogether slightly differently, the\nDramsoc production will definately be\nworth a look.\n(continued from front page)\nRAG\nAnother new event was the Beer\nFestival, which was a great success, the\nSuperag glasses being in great demand,\nand (despite the extreme cheapness of\nthe beer) making a healthy profit. The credit for this superb event must go to\nNick Morton, who organised it all, with\na little help from Chris Bruton, Tim and\nthe Real Ale Soc crowd, and of course\nDram soc for the scaffolding. I'd also\nlike to thank everyone who helped\nserve, clear up etc, and especially Scout\nand Guide Club who did the food.\nThe other big event was surely the\nProcession, and although it left me behind after about f if tee en minutes, I was quite satisfied to have seen it get off\n(almost) without a hitch; a task which\nseemed impossible when I stated '\nworking on it last July! I'm sure\neveryone who went enjoyed it; even the\nPolice who were really great, and thanks goes to the CC Us, Selkirk Hall and the Red Cross for putting on floats,\nnot to mention Kirsten and Adrian, our\nresident Michelin Men. The accompanying collection.was also very\nsuccessful, and a special mention must\nbe given to Jo, who not only collected\nthe most money, but managed to pass\non her enthusiasm to the few heroic\nGuildspeople who went out again t collect in the evening, thus bringing the\nday's total to over \u00a31,100, enough to buy\ntwo radio-hearing aids which we should\nbe able to buy and present sometime\nnext term. Well time and space don't permit me to go through every event, but thanks\nmust go to everyone who staged an\nevent, ie Scab, Aerosoc, Folk Club etc\nand particularly the C CU Execs,\nJOHN MILES CONCERT\nwith Roy Sundholm as support\nThere were about 600 people in the Great\nhall when Roy Sundholm, the support act,\nstarted his set just after 8:15 on Monday\nevening. Roy describes his music as \"modern\nRock'n 'Roll\" which is a very apt description;\neach of the eight songs that he played was\nup-tempo, although there was certainly a variation in style. His album The Chinese\nMethod was recorded with session musicians\nand the six-piece group he had on stage had\nonly been together for two months, but they\nseemed to play together remarkably well.\nApart from Roy Sundholm on lead vocals and\nguitar, there were two other guitarists, bass,\ndrums and keyboards. The latter, though,\nwere underused, being swamped by the\nguitars.\nOf the songs that he played, I most liked\nthe second number The Girls Are Out Now\nwhich was fast Rock'n 'Roll and apart from a good tune, had more life than many of the\nothers. After that he launched into his new\nsingle Did You Ever Have A Heart which was\nquite a raunchy number. Of the remaining\nsongs, several seemed to have a distinct\nheavy metal influence, but with a strong\ndrum/bass beat, and a couple reminded me a little of Foreigner.\nWhen John Miles came on stage at 9:30\n(by which time the audience had swelled to\nabout 700), he gave a much more professional impression right from the start;\nlikewise it was obvious who the crowd had\nwaited for. The very start of his act was\nobviously planned and reminded me of the\nway the Floyd used to start their concerts.\nIn the second number High Fly, his first\nsingle, the lighting and special effects were\nfirst used with crossed spotlights from below\non John Miles and smoke around his legs.\nThe song itself. I felt was rather more rocky\nthan the original, with harder vocals He went\nstraight from that into the title track of his first\nalbum, Rebel which he sung with feeling,\nbacked by effective bass and keyboards.\nAfter Bad Blood from his latest album\nMore Miles Per Hour he played Pull t ne Damn\nThing Down, which despite its age. was given\na very modern treatment: the most notable\nthing about it was the drum orientated\ninstrumental at the end, with superb strobe\nlighting under the drum kit.\nJohn Miles then introduced the band:\napart from himself on vocals and lead guitar,\nthere was Bob Marshall on bass and other\nguitars, Barry Black on drums and Brian\nChapman playing three separate keyboards.\nHis new single Don't Give Me Your\nSympathy was next. Very uptempo but\ntypically John Miles\nespecially VP s, for the many events\nthey were involved in.\nI'm greatly indebted to everyone who\nhelped in any way, and special thanks to\nChaps Club for their highly successful\nRaga rama, I hope there's another next\nyear; Brendon, Mr Mooney and Dram soc Pyrosoc for the Barbeque: the\nRCS Ents Committee (except me),\nespecially Rich and Marco for bringing\nexcellence back into the Smoking Concert and everyone who helped at the\nRag and Drag Disco, including Mrs YVeale, Harry Fair brother, Annie Lathaen and Malcolm Brain for\njudging, Harvey for the disco, Nick for\ncom per eing and all the RCS stalwarts\nwho set up or cleared up and also\napologies to Paul who was on the door\npractically all night.

It opened with a Buster Keaton film. The General, a good film,\nbut I think enjoyed as much for its incongruity\nas anything else. SP3 played us a session of\njazz rock and the drummer is to be\ncommended. The band's performance was\nimpressive. Shakespeare must be oscillating\nin his grave after Derrick Everett's interpretation of all his ply as in forty minutes.\nAs a member of the cast, I felt the atmosphere\nwas hilarious, Dramsoc was acting well and\njudging by the giggles rising from the\ndarkened halt even the audience enjoyed it!\nAnother band rose from the roadie s' confusion; Paradox, who played well but\nwould have been much improved by more\npower, a cleaner sound, and a tidying up of\nragged edges.\nKen Russell's The Boyfriend ended Scab\nNight.

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER CLUB\nOn Wednesday last, the immortal C team\nworked over the infamous and un famous B team. Evading the homosexual advances of\nthe B team captain and his jolly crew of nice\nboys, we advanced to our corners, refusing\nbluntly to spank them, so the game started.\nThe frothing Leclezio, rubbed his thigh in\nanger at seeing we'd switched our order and\nput our best player Dave 'we'll fight them on the beaches' Nuttall. The game heated up\nwhen Alice 'show us your legs' Cameron was\nordered to be evicted by Leclezio only to see\nLeclezio later sporting a gigantic shiner on\nhis right eye (don't mention Iran Soc). Nuttal\nlost, so he has to spend a throbbing night with\nour team 'goer' Alex Cameron (Physics 3) -YOU can book a night with him as well.\nNext, those two beer chums, Curtis (C team) and Calvert played and needless to say,\nCalvert lost (for a change) playing like a wet\ncopy of the Daily Star (or seeming to play with\none). Well, I played next and needless to say,\nsince I'm wonderful, brilliant, gorgeous,\nsuperb, exquisite, slick AND Welsh, I won.\nMaybe it's something to do with the fact that\nmy opponent, Mr Jeans, was suffering from\ndelusions of heterosexuality which were\ntotally out of character with the blok e. Damian 'as thematic hobgoblin' Kelly was\non for us against the wormy diarrhoea\nextract, Tomsky who just can't win games of\nsnooker to save his life. I don't like punishing\nhim like this because he is sensitive but why,\noh why God, did you produce such a weak\nsickly snooker player of this cala bre, I mean\nhe played like a chewed up foetus and fully\nAs outlined in last week's report, the Club's opening match promised a good season.\nSaturday's home match against Southampton bore out this confidence. Ron\nJohnson of Kingston Poly, but bowling for us,\nled the firsts to an easy 200 pin 4-0 win, with a fine 608 series; while the ladies in winning 4-0 achieved their first victory in at least four\nyears.\nMeanwhile the seconds had cruised to a healthy 2-0 lead, almost let it slip, but held on\nfor a31 win. So everything looked set for a100% result: the thirds had rallied well to go\ninto the final game level, and a total 10-0\nresult seemed possible. It was not to be: Roy\nof the Rovers, or his bowling equivalent, is not\nto be found in the IC thirds and a disappointing collapse led to a31 defeat and\nan overall 8-2 victory.\nNevertheless, this was our first victory over\nSouthampton in recent years and gave the\nteam confidence for Sunday's match at\nBrunei.\nTEAMS Firsts: Ron Johnson, John Knight, Brian\nMacGowan, Danny Lau and Tubby Woo.\nSeconds: Joe Wong, Tim Hillyer, Lawrence\nPoon, Robert Cheung and Joe Ng.\nThirds: Paul Jeynes, Ray Cook, Stuart Cox,\nThomas Wong and Nigel Heath.\nLadies: Delia Wong, Marie Cheong, Merhala\nThurai, Ruby Wong and Lousia Lau.\nEventually, everyone got to the Airport\nBowl on Sunday, for the lunchtime match,\nonly to find the roll-off delayed by half-an-hour. The firsts again won, although only on\nthe last ball of the day. Danny Lau bowled at\ndeserves these ticking s off - so no more\nbleeding subservient grovelling towards me\nplease, Mr McLelland for mercy. This means\nthat the score was a31 win to the C team and\na as a formality our weak link Alex (vital\nstatistics 24-36-24-11/2) Cameron played\nthat dark, silent 'Valentino with glasses' figure\nAndy 'Iron Curtain''Kresewski. Alice played\nlike an albino p enquin sunbathing and\nflipped his lid and lost owing to political\njostling from Ayatolah Leclezio who accused\nhim of spying and forthwith received a black\neye (see earlier). So the final result was 3-2to the C team, who are still top of the league.\n(I 've got them well under control now, since\nI 've had training in zoo keeping)/ TEAMS B Team: A Mazio, T Repellant, S Jones\n(Capt), C Cavity, and A?.C Team: A Cameroons, G BrilliantWonderful, D Smelly, G Shitartus and D Fuckall.\nThe A team played LSE B( or was it with\nthe msl eves who can tell). Amid an air of\nsevere tension owing to the fact that their two\nstar players (and only decent players)\ndropped out to go to the England match\n(must have foggy minds), Pressy Tea urn,\nimp ers in at inga punk aw allah, put his foot\ndown and demanded that they would win\neven though the team was worse than the\nspastics shot putting team. First on was Dave\n'our man in Hong Kong, China, Japan and\nany other slant y eyed country' Crossland\n10 pins, needing two to win and got a solid\n8 to give a31 win. Likewise the seconds\nscraped a win, having surprised themselves\nby drawing level at 1-1 and then surprising\nBrunei by producing a good 806 team game,\nto produce a31 result. Disappointingly, the\nthirds and ladies found the Brunei teams too\nstrong on their home lanes and were\nprobably also tired from the match on Saturday. Both teams slumped 4-0.\nThe overall result was a64 defeat, the best\nwe have done against Brunei. A win would\nhave given us a chance of topping the SouthEast Division, if assuming a good victory in\nthe remaining match. However, it was\nanother good result. We now have an\nexcellent team and are now beginning to get\nthe results. Barring any more auto-electrical\nmishaps, this should continue.\nTEAMS Firsts: Ron Johnson. John Knight. Brian\nMacGowan. Joe Ng and Danny Lau.\nSeconds: Thomas Wong. Tim Hillyer, Neil\nHunt. Albert Yue and Robert Cheung.\nThirds: Paul Jeynes. Ray Cook. Lawrence\nPoon, Nigel Heath and Nigel Windsor\nLadies: Delia Wong, Marie Cheong, Merhala\nThurai, Ruby Wong and Lousia Lau.\nThere will be league bowling next\nWednesday as usual. The minibus leaves\nfrom Aero (opposite Beit Arch) at 2-30\nprompt. Many thanks to everyone who played\nlast weekend, especially those who push-started my car.\nCheers,\nTim.\nwho showed his diplomatic touch by\ncastrating his opponent who didn't see any\nballs and was annihilated like a kilo of napalm\ninside a Russian labour camp.\nNext to the sickly coloured cloth was happy\nboy Proudiove, our IF correspondent, whose\nlumpy performance provided as much\nentertainment to the crowd as seeing the\npope's body lying in state. He was the victor\nsylv est or of the A team who.were 2-0 up. On to the bowling green came MrTeaurn himself\nthinking he could play snooker which is\nabout the same as thinking he was a British\ncitizen (joke). He played with as much control\nas a hedgehog in a nudist camp and was\nthoroughly massacred like a Rhodesian\ncommoner.\nSean off Armstrong was on next. It has\nbeen hinted that this person does not look\nlike a toothless leprechaun. The person who\nsaid that must be married to a pin noc hio nosed bag of flies. What a chronic\nperformance he put up. A deaf bat was more\nuse to the team and would have certainly had\nmore chance of scoring (in both senses of the\nword). Last to play was one of Harvey Smith's horse Sanyo music centre whose links with\nchairmen Mao have been compared with\nMargaret Thatcher' s connections with\nGaysoc (re considerable). His yellow streak\n- didn't show and he kung fue d his way to a dramatic 'bull in a china shop' win.\nTeam: D Pissland, M Randilover, S Teaurn\n(capt), S Barmpot and S Yuwho.\n. Grandpa\nFOOTBALL\nIC 6th s GET FA IN CUP\nIC 6th s vs Charing Cross 3rds:15 IC 6th s biggest chance for fame and glory\nyet came in this 2nd round cup match. After\nsailing through the first round IC started well\nand after ten minutes had not only achieved\ntheir target of not conceding a goal but had\nalso created a few scoring opportunities.\nThen, with IC playing their best football of the\nseason and very much against the run of play,\nthe opposition scored. This quirk of fate was\naccepted in a similar philosophical manner as\nthe previous 28 have been this season and\ndespite continuing pressure IC found\nthemselves 1-0 down at half-time.\nDuring the interval IC sporting ly offered\nCharing Cross the oranges first and were\nrewarded for this gesture by being left the\nsmallest orange segments. As a direct result\nof this lack of refreshment IC found\nthemselves 3-0 down shortly after the restart.\nAgain, IC came forward but soon found\nthemselves 4-0 down (sorry about that lads!).\nThis goal seemed to add more zest to IC's already building attack and soon they won a free kick just outside the area. George\nAdach's pin-pointed kick found Dave (could I just say this is the first time I 've appeared in\nFELIX?) Braaley rising above the defence to\nnod the ball past the keepers despairing dive.\nFrom then on IC pulled all the stops out and\ncame close many times before allowing\nCharing Cross a consolation goal just before\nthe end.\nTeam: Names not given to avoid prosecution.\nD Tinkler\nTENPIN BOWLING\n19\n\n"

Since then severe l other outlets have been fitted around College.\nNon - music programming is an imp or ant part of our schedule, and\nthe News service, which started about two years ago, provides\nCollege news and information which might be of interest to students.\nFollowing a sucessful application to the Home Office for a test\nlicence, a transmitter was built during 1978 to broadcast to the Halls\nof Residence around Prince's Gardens; After a Home Office test a licence was granted on 30th November last, and regular\ntransmissions began two days later. You can look back at the\nprogress of the station during the past year at 6pm on Sunday in\nFocus.\nJeremy Nunn s Friday 30th November Monday 3rd December\n5.60\n6.00\n7.00\n9.00\n11.00\n1.00\n8.00\n11.00\n1.00\n6.00\n9.00\n11.00\n1.00\nTune In - Jim Bacon American Rock Programme Viewpoint Chris Dalton Roundabout Gerard Jennings Through Midnight Jon Marsden Close down Saturday 1st December\nWake up with Jon Jon Firth.

I think we chose some\nreally disgusting games; some people\nnever want to see another baked bean\nagain! The Beer Festival on Wednesday\nwas great fun with many excellent pints\nof ale being drunk. Thursday was Exec\nTorture with a mixture prepared by Mr PJ Leggett which exceeded the bounds\nof common decency. However, he\nreceived a fair proportion of this muck\nover himself. Over \u00a3100 was collected\nfor Rag. Carnival was on Friday with\nover 1,000 people attending. The bands\nwent down well, especially Urchin and\nthe Steel Band and everybody enjoyed\nthemselves.\nAnybody who has seen a Guilds shield\naround, the fancy one which went\nmissing at Carnival, please tell us or\ngive it back. It is not a mascot, it is\nan inviolate (that is not violate)\ndecoration.\nAs you may know, our Honorary\nSecretary, Mark Hope has resigned, due\nto academic pressure. This means we\nhave to elect a new Hon Sec. Papers will\ncome down at 5:30pm today (Friday). If\nyou still want to stand see us in the\nUnion Office, then get your name on the\npaper with ten second ers. This is an\nimportant post with many responsibilities. A job description has been\ncirculated, so read this and come and\nfind out more in the Office.

All those who attended the\nlecture by Stan Foster on Coal\nWorldwide were given food for thought.\nCopies of the paper he presented are in\nall RS M libraries.\nTuesday saw Professor Pushley's lecture on Crystal Structures Through The Electron Microscope followed by\nthe Met & Mat Sci Soc Hot Pot Supper\nwhich everyone enjoyed.\nFUTURE EVENTS\nTOMORROW Cardiff are coming up to\nplay RS M at rugby and soccer, so your\nsupport will be needed especially in the\nbar in the evening.

How sad it is that society kills and\nburies our true thoughts and feelings while\npeople who refuse to bury the truth and\nrefuse to accept the stereotype of convention\nare rejected by society and made to feel guilty\nor insane.\nFortunately some gays have the courage to\nface a hostile society and this has led to gay\ndemonstrations like the one recently in New\nYork of over 100,000 gay women and gay men\ndemonstrating against legal discrimination\nagainst gays.\nThat prejudice and discrimination against\ngays stills exists is well illustrated by the\nrecent case of Dan White who literally got\naway with murder.\nHow could Dan White, who murdered the\nSan Francisco Mayor, George Moscome and\nhis supervisor Harvey Milk, who fired nine\nbullets into his victims and shot each one\ntwice in the back of the head, who had clearly\npremeditated the murders as he had\nsmuggled the shotgun into the building and\nshot the two men in different rooms, how\ncould he not be found guilty of murder? Well,\nHarvey Milk was gay and the Mayor, George\nMos cone, though not gay, strongly supported the rights of gays and though of\ncourse not explicitly stated, the undertones\nof prejudice and bigotry have clearly led to\nthis blatant travesty of justice.\nBob Rigby (Chairman, IC Gaysoc)\nULU GAY SOC have meetings every\nThursday at 8:00pm in room 2D of the\nUniversity of London Union, Malet Street\n(nearest tubes: Goodge Street or Russel\nSquare) EVERYONE WELCOME!\nNOWHERE TO GO FOR CHRISTMAS?\nMany people have nowhere to go for the rest of the\nyear either - as anyone who has been on the soup\nrun will tell you. Crisis at Christmas runs a shelter\nfrom 23 to 28 December in London and needs\nvolunteers to help throughout that period. You can\ncome for just one day, or for the whole week. Help is\nalso needed before and after to prepare the centre\nand to clear up. For more information, contact Fiona\nSinclair (Maths 2 letter racks).\nFOOD AND CLOTHES\nAre you looking forward to lots of good food and\nclothes for Christmas? How about sparing a thought for the homeless and hungry of London.\nThese people do not have much of a life, so try to\ngive them a happy Christmas - it doesn't take much.\nPlease bring donations of food (stuff that will keep\nuntil Christmas!) and warm clothes, to the ICCAG\nroom at lunchtime (top of the Union building -follow the signs) or to Selkirk 666 Donations are\nalso welcome, please make cheques payable to\nCrisis at Christmas.

The UH LC believe they should\nbe responsible for any censorship of the\nrecords that they buy and that the records in\nquestion are acceptable.\nAfter a successful challenge to the order of\nthe agenda, the motion on the Public Image\nOf IC was debated and the proposed\nam mend ment that the reference to \"beer-swilling louts with latent homosexual\ntendencies\" was offensive to gays and should\nbe replaced was passed A majority also\npassed the motion.\nThe Anti-Corrie Bill motion was moved\nstraight to a vote, and passed by a large\nmajority. The main debate was propounded\nat the last U GM when a challenge to the\nquorum was made and upheld before the vote\nwas taken\nThe motion On The Underground was also\npassed with the am mend ment to ICU instructs that IC should at end the education\ncuts protest march organised by the TUC for Wednesday 28 November. The am mend ment proposed that the campaign should focus on\nthe overseas students fees increase rather\nthan the cuts in general was defeated.\nLate News: Hall rents will probably not now\nbe increased (see above).\nWASTE Environmental Week got oil lo a good star!\nyesterday.

    "content": "The British Society for Social Responsibility in Science conference\nwas hosted this year by Imperial College\nScience for People Group and took\nplace on Saturday 24 November at IC.\nAll the discussions were rivetting (as\nusual) but the discussion on Microprocessors in particular prompted\nme to overcome my usual lethargy and\nread the articles I had around on the\nissue and set down a personal view of\nsome of the issues involved.\nIF CHIPS COULD FLY\nOccasionally one could believe that the\nchip can do everything; including flying\nacross the atlantic. Unfortunately this\nisn't so far from the truth. Cruise missiles\ncan; arriving at allocated spots with\nremarkable precision. Microelectronics\nwere originally developed by the\ndefence industry. However, you can't always judge a child by its parent\n(though have you ever wondered why\nthere are so many electronic war games\naround - the Union Lower Lounge being\nno exception!).\nITS A WONDERFUL THINGSCIENCE!\nThe new technology is revolution ising everything from cash registers and\ncalculators, petrol pumps and pinball s to televisions, typesetters and telecommunications. Everything is\ngetting smaller, therefore using less\nmaterial. The production of chips is not\nenergy intensive and therefore aids\nconservation. In the process of greater\nme chan is ation, boring and repetitive\njobs are being ended - or are they?\nUnfortunately the chip is stealing many\nskilled jobs, people are replaced by\nmach nes without consideration of the\nsocial implications. Who would you\nrather greet at a service station: an\nefficient self-service petrol pump with\nflashing green lights, or a friendly petrol\npump attendant who chats away to you\nto add a bit of cheer to your day? The job\nof secretaries is being reduced to copy\ntyping by word processors that have\npre programmed layout and simple\nediting, skilled welders are reduced to\nmachine minder s, even a brain surgeon\ncan be replaced by a machine (with the\nhelp of a junior doctor). Whereas, lots of\nreally dreary repetitive jobs are not\nbeing changed by new technology;\ndustmen, packaging workers, postmen\netc, while existing skilled jobs are being\nde skilled. You may be thinking: well, if\nthere's no future in brain surgery there is\nat least some in software, but even there\nyou could be wrong. Computers are\nnow being programmed to develop their\nown software in many instances.\nEstimates of structural unemployment\ndue to the new .technology vary, but\n2 1/2 million in Britain seems to be a likely figure for the near future. Of the\npeople in work, we could be left with a technocrat ic elite and de skilled masses.\nJoint meeting:\nScience for People\nand Communist Soc\nwith Dr Leo Pyle\nspeaking on THE THIRD WORLD AND\nTHE ENVIRONMENT\nin Maths 341 on\nTuesday 4 December\nat 7:00pm. 'THE ONLY THING I WOULDN'T SWOP MY JOB FOR IS UNEMPLOYMENT' (QUOTE FROM A COAL MINER)\nMany people are suggesting that what is\nneeded is to move away from society's idea of 'work ethic' and to train people in\nthe art of leisure. This idealistic view\nseems to ignore the current education\ncuts and cuts in the arts and other\nfacilities. It seems unlikely, if you are\none of the unlucky unemployed that you\nwill have anything more interesting or\nsocially useful to do than to play on an\nelectric TV game all day (that's if you can\nafford it on the dole!).\nIN NEXT FRIDAY'S30 th Anniversary FELIX\nCOLIN PALMER, OF\nTHE COMPUTING &\nCONTROL DEPT\nWILL BEGIN A SERIES OF ARTICLES\nON\nCOMPUTERS\nCOMPOSING MUSIC\nTHE LUDDITE FACTOR\nPerhaps the Luddites weren't so bad\nafter all? Unfortunately most of the old\nmovement was shipped to Australia.\nThey aren't doing so badly there\nhowever, the Australian TUC has just\ndecided to attempt to enforce a five year\nmoratorium on the further introduction\nof new technology. However, my view is\nthat it is possible to make constructive\nuse of the microchip but you have to\nbegin from a different standpoint.\nWHOSE SOCIETY?\nSome people would reply that it's the\nmachines, if its IQ is over 120. It has been\nsuggested that if computers develop an.\nintelligence quotient of this figure then\nwe will have to consider whether they\nare human and perhaps make it a punishable offence to switch them off.\n(This brings into question how to regard\npeople with an IQ below 120!) Beforethe\nwhole debate'gets out of hand we ought\nto remember that machines are\ndeveloped as tools to help humankind\n(or should be). Unfortunately we are not\nalways united on our definition of\nprogress. Current industrialists seem to\nregard progress as anything that costs\nless (in money terms). Human labour is\nexpensive and best expended and\nmachines have the added advantage of\nnot tending to disobey orders.\nIdeally society should discuss the\nimplications of the new technology on\neach occasion it may be introduced. A future does exist for the new technology\nthat can benefit us all. It opens up the\nway to ending the divide between work\nand leisure and to develop further\ncreative skills. However, its present use\nis to de human is e the workplace and pit\nthe human being against the supposed\ngreater skill and speed of the machine.\nIn a capitalist society where democracy\nis defined as 'those who own should\ndecide', it is difficult to exert any real\ncontrol over the introduction of\nmicroprocessors. Trade unions have\nstruggled over the last century for the\nworkers right to some control over work\nconditions. The new technology makes\ntheir role even more decisive. In the\nshort term they need to fight for it only to\nbe introduced in cases where the\nworking week is shortened, there is\nincreased, and/or diversified production\nand where the working environment is\nnot de human is ed, with all workers being\ngiven opportunities to develop skills.\nGreater 'efficiency' is not the only\ncriterion to be used. Unfortunately these\nthings are never simple. International\ncompetition exerts a tremendous pressure for accepting new technology\nwithout such stringent conditions, but if\nsociety is to be saved from the horrors of\na 'brave new world' we must all at least\nbegin the fight for social control of the\nmicrochip.\nMary Attenborough\n13\n\n"

    "content": "PREVIEWS\nThis week I thought I'd look at\nsome of the films which will be released\nin the next few months. Being the\nChristmas period, many of the major\ndistributors will be releasing films which\nthey hope will make much money.\nMost prominent is the long-awaited\nand much praised Apocalypse Now\nfrom director Francis Ford Coppola.\nSeven years in the making, this film is\nbound to be the centre of attention due\nto its controversial treatment of\nVietnam. Strangely, there will be two\nversions; a title less70 mm version for the\nWest End and a titled 35mm version\n(complete with different ending!) for\ncountry wide release. Some people just\nlike being difficult. I'm assured by Roger\nStotesbury that it is brilliant, but I shall\nneed to see it to be convinced.\nNext on the extravaganza list is the\namazing Star Trek - The Motion Picture.\nI say amazing, as it is quite strange how a television series which started way back\nin 1966 can survive to become a film and\nstill have the same stars. Older, in\ndifferent uniforms and aboard a new\nEnterprise, Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Chekov,\nSulu, Uhura, McCoy and even Nurse\nChappel are all still there to save the\nEarth from certain destruction. Admitted Kirk is now an Admiral,\nCaptain Dekker runs the Enterprise and\nthere is a bald, female navigator, but\nthings are bound to be just the same.\nHowever, I have been informed that the\nspecial effects are very realistic (ie\nexpensive) and include a photon\ntorpedo being created and fired down a tube on the Enterprise. I hope to review\nthe film fully in the last FELIX of term, as\nit will be released on Saturday 15fh December at the Empire Leicester\nSquare and simultaneously at many\ncinemas all over the country.\nl*t*r. \u00ab site Leonard Nimoy returns to play Mr Spock\nStill ort the space theme (no groans\nplease) is Disney's The Black Hole. This\nis Disney's most expensive project to\ndate and also their first 'A' certificate. It\nconcerns the discovery of a huge space\nvessel, the USS Cygnus, circling a black\nhole. Its commander, Dr Hans Reinhardt, is the only human aboard and\ninsists on making his rescuers witness\nhis descent into the black hole, where he\nbelieves he will find another universe\nand eternal life. Well, well, there's one\nborn every minute isn't there. Seriously,\nthough, despite the wonderful, expensive publicity, the wonderful,\nexpensive special effects and the\nwonderful, expensive cinema tickets, I doubt whether this will appeal to many\nof you. It looks like a children's film, but\nperhaps you can keep one of your gro tty little cousins quiet with it as a Christmas\ntreat - that'll be my excuse to see it. I hope to review this fully as well at a later\ndate.\nTHE USS CYGNUS copyright Walt Disney Productions\nThe crew of the Palamino arrive aboard the\nUSS Cygnus.\nfl ll ll ll ll ll iiI'\" HMMI ]\nCreeping up at the start of December\nis one welcome light note. Peter Sellers\nstars in a remake of The Prisoner of\nZenda which will un doubt ably be cast in\nhis own life style (he wrote most of it).\nGreat comedies are few and far\nbetween, so I hope that the recent\nrelease of Monty Python's Life of Brian is\nnot a bad omen. Also due for release is\nMeteor, a disaster movie in which the\nearth is endangered by a shower of huge\nmeteors. A star-studded cast is included\nfor good measure with some new and\ntechnically difficult special effects. I hope it's worthwhile.\nAll in all, December looks quite\npromising with a broad range of films to\ncover most tastes. Incidently, it is\nrumoured that besides The Sound of\nMusic, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, etc, we\nmay see 2001: A Space Odyssey on\ntelevison over Christmas. A real classic-not to be missed.\nMark Smith\n16\n\n"

The fog\ngradually began to come down and in one of\nthe better moves George Adach received the\nball from Nigel Audin just outside the penalty\narea and the swerving ball was too much for\nthe keeper to hold and IC were 6-1 up. (In my\nunbiased opinion this was the finest goal of\nthe game - ego trip!).\nTowards the end the fog was so bad that the\ngoalposts were just vis is ble from the halfway\nline. The SOAS captain - a true sportsman in\nthe face ot defeat - agreed to play to the end.\nI would like to thank Paul Archer, the\nsubstitute who cheered on from the touch line although he couldn't see anything. To all our\nloyal supporters like Zap and Marek who\ncouldn't get tickets for the match but assure\nme were there in spirit, I hope this report\nmakes up for their disappointment.\nThe team was: Rynbeek, Tinkler, Bradley,\nSola, Davies, Audin, Adach (Capt), Muttock,\nBaldwin, Wolfson and Slater.\nGeorge Ada ch TABLE TENNIS IC 2 vs BSC2( AWAY): 2-7\nThis must be the most nauseating result the\n2nds have managed this year. A defeat by a team from a division lower than themselves.\nAgain Andy 'Tye-ered of life' suffered three\nignominious thrashings (I 'll supply the razor\nblades), Phil (Well he lost too!) Walker was\nabout as much good as a muscle-bound\nclam, and Bob Edde just ex capes my worst\nsarcasm (only because he's foreign and I'm not racist, b wan al). However, IC 4 vs TEXACO 2 was another\nbucket of shit. We all played like a gas (and\nTexaco cracked like a an egg-SHELL), to win\n9-0. ESSO-specially good was Phallic Slywon (even though blind in two eyes) and we\ncan all look forward to having our next round\nmatch sometime during the Christmas\nholidays.\nThe thirds, lead by Stiff Jeans (put it away\nJeff!), had a buy, and so too did Sheik\nSingalonga-be dy by-rajah's team the (f) worsts.\nNastier than usual,\nLord Peter Whimsical\nRUGBY REPORT\nLONDON HOSPITAL vs ICRFC\n1sts:143 The quarterfinals of the Gutteridge Cup\nsaw ICRFC 1sts taking on the might of\nLondon Hospital. Hopes of repeating the\nCup final victory of two seasons ago were\nhigh, but London proved to be the stronger\nside and won a hard, tight game by a score of\n14-3.\nImperial started strongly and dominated\nthe first quarter. They took the lead with a penalty goal, but a breakaway try for London\ngave the home side a lead of 6-3 at half-time.\nThe second half saw London increase the\nscore with two further tries and although\nImperial battled hard in the closing minutes\nthey did not succeed in crossing their\nopponent's line.\nHowever, the IC team played well and this\nwas satisfying after a recent series of\ndisappointing losses. Team verdict after the\ngame was that IC had lost to a good side and\nso everybody retired to the bar to drown their\nsorrows and celebrate somebody's birthday!\nThanks must go to John Dyson who kindly\nplayed a scrum half and who proceeded to\ngive a fine, all-round display.\nTeam: S Gunn, R Davies, J Mauzoui, A Warby, R Smart, P Goring, S Townsend, J Austin, J Dyson, E Budgen, P Dunleary, J Chandler, W Burgoyne, R Parkinson, and D Pullen.

That memorable afternoon saw\nIC 6th s clinch their first win in living memory.\nAfter a disappointing result in the cup the\nprevious Saturday and as a result of four\nchanges in the team IC cruised to a61 victory over SOAS 2nds. Any doubts\nresulting from travel fatigue and the\nanomalous behaviour of the chocolate\nmachine in North Acton were promptly\ndispelled as IC won the toss.\nWithin sixty seconds IC were in the lead, a perfect cross from Daniel Wolfson on the\nright found the head of a SOAS defender who\nneatly flicked the ball past his goalkeeper and\ninto the net. Spurred on by the remarkably\nunprecedented event of being in the lead,\nWolfson added two more superb goals to IC's tally after some skilful runs down the left by\nGary Slater and Neil Muttock. With the threat\nof having to buy a round if he scored again,\nWolfson decided not to score any more,\nalthough he did hit the cross-bar.\nA period of frustration fol i wed which saw\nSOAS have some near misses. They would\nhave scored had it not been for the\ndetermined tackling of IC defence consisted\nof - Sola, Bradley, Davies and Tinkler. A dangerous moment came when SOAS won a free kick just outside the penalty area and a certain goal was prevented when -George\nAdach headed the SOAS striker instead of the\nball.\nThe game sprang back into life with the\nball breaking from defence to Ken Baldwin on\nthe right. He went past three defenders and\nwith only the keeper to beat he hit the post but\nmanaged to control the awkward rebound\nand this time made no mistake. A few minutes\nlater in a near identical Baldwin scored again.\nTHE HAMSOC BIT(S) Right, let's try again! If you are (not\nsurprisingly) uncertain about what the title\nmeans, taking it left to right: THE self\nexplanatory HAM SOC the high-powered\nnon-harmonic soon-no-longer-3kHz off-channel we-also-walk-dogs Amateur Radio\nSociety of Imperial College BITS elementary\n'particles' of information. In other words, this\nis an article'by your local, worldwide radio\nstation, some HAMSOC members being\nqualified to operate radio transmitters, and\nthus talk to people all over the world, which in\nmy typical roundabout, lop-sided manner,\nbrings me to my first point.\nPlease will anyone wanting to take the\nRadio Amateur's examination next May write\nto me care of the physics undergraduate\nletter rack, or just collar me some time. We are\ngoing to run classes for the May RAE next\nterm, and so I would like to know who will\ndefinately be taking the exam and who will\njust be coming to the classes. We are also\nconsidering giving out printed notes, so if you\ncould indicate whether you would pay, say\n50p for these, I would be grateful.\nIncidentally, don't forget that the morse\nclasses are still running: Elec Eng 1207 at\n1:00pm every Wednesday. Anyway, for those\nnot familiar with HAMSOC, this is what we do:\nSo far this term, we have had several\noutings, from a trip to Leicester, to a radio-controlled pub-crawl, and also, several talks,\nthe most popular being a stimulating lecture\nby Professor Laithwaite, which was much\nappreciated.\nAs to forthcoming activities, in the\nremainder of this term we have a talk by Mr\nHarry, from the Home Office on Interference\nProblems and we will probably have either a 'fox hunt' or 'treasure hunt' on Wimbledon\nCommon. Since it is possible to succeed in\nventures like this without a transmitter,\nobviously unlicensed members will be able to\nparticipate fully.\nOther thrills we have lined up include\nconstruction al projects which we are trying\nto raise funds for. One of these, stemming out\nof the Microwaves talk, is to build a pair of 10\nGHz transceivers. Will all the people who\nhave said they are interested (and those that\nhaven't, who are) please get in touch with\nFrank Rowsell, Elec Eng 1.\nAlso, anyone interested in getting some\nsort of RTTY set-up going (particularly\nanyone who knows anything at all about it)\nplease get hold of me.\nNext term's arrangements \"are still a little\nnebulous as far as talks etc go but I can say\nthat the RAE classes are a certainty (provided\nsomebody is interested!) and one definite talk\nwill be Dr Big nell on Satellite Communications. We are also trying to\norganise a rather novel visit (ever wonder\nhow they're (!!) electronically tested?).\nFinally, come on girls, where are you?\nThere isn'ta micro-gram of male chau van is m in HAMSOC you know, is it just the brand of\nde or doran tI'm using? Anyway, if you're\ninterested in us, why not come up and see us\none Wednesday afternoon? You'll find us in a wooden hut on the roof of Elec Eng, so if\nHAMSOC appeals to you, or you just want to\nknow what sort of pratt writes articles like\nthis, I 'll see you up there on Wednesday!\nJ Savage\nCampaign Against Blood Sport please note\nA 'fox hunt' is a sort of direction finding\ncontest, sort of radio-controlled orienteering\n18\n\n"

Perhaps we\nshould really blame Refectory Committee (last year's) and ask them for\n\u00a31.00 each, or \u00a370,000 (whichever is\ngreater!).\nHALDANE L The meeting heard of the censorship\nbeing operated in Haldane L against records being bought by\nst ts. Most people agreed that\nthis policy was a load of excrement.\nDEMOCRACY AND DISRUPTION\nAfter the Executive- reports and the\nelection for UL US CR( who?), the\nmotion everyone had been waiting for\nwas moved first on the agenda. The\nmotion concerned the Executive responsibility for IC's failure on\nUniversity Challenge (or was it the\nmascot's fault?)'. Two attempts were\nmade to subvert the course of\ndemocracy and get the meeting to revert\nto serious business, both were decisively quashed.\nBefore the motion was passed, the\nanti-gay remarks were at least deleted,\nthough I did expect someone from the\nLeft to delete the one sexist remark\nconcerning the need for more women at\nIC to help the team score. They could\nperhaps have inserted: \"To encourage\nsoci a logy students in order to get more\nMarx\" but that would perhaps given too\nmuch of a different Engel on the subject.\nAGAINST THE CORRIE BILL\nAt last the motion against the Corrie\nanti-abortion bill was passed. Although\nwe still don't know whether Merche\nClark was ever unborn, we did learn\n(from a gentleman who was definately\nborn) that women can't be trusted to\ncontrol their own bodies because they\nare forced into abortions by\nunscrupulous men (who are the real\nIC LADIES XV vs UC LADIES XV:\n4-10\nThe first ladies match of the season took\nplace at Harlington last Sunday morning. For\nanyone expecting to see a farce, there was a great disappointment, for this match was\nplayed at a surprisingly high standard and\nboth teams put on a more than com pet ante xh ibt ion of rugby football.\nUnder the lawful eye of referee, \"I didn't mean it\" Gunner, UC kicked off. Immediately,\nIC made use of their superior backs and\nlaunched a counter attack, which event aul ly broke down on the U C25yd line. Although it\nwas clear that the UC pack were stronger\nthan ours, we were able to obtain good\npossession through some excellent tackling\nby the whole team and some inspired ruc king by our pack. This hard work eventually led to\na try, when Thunder Thighs made, a blind\nbreak and beat two tackles for a fine try. the conversion attempt by Cornetto was unlucky\nto just scrape the outside of the post.\nAfter the restart UC began to win their\nshare of possession, but they were stunned\nat the tackling ability of the whole IC team;\nHotlips Hood, Animal and Happy Hooker, to\nname just a few. Due to this superb tackling,\nIC were able to set up some good attacking\nmoves thor ugh the fly half. Dodger. This led\nto some fine runs from wingers, Dosser and\nCornetto. Smurf and Streaker also showed\ntheir class in the centre with Streaker |\nshowing her legs on more than one occasion. \u00ab\nShe was unlucky to fall two yards short of the .\u00a7\nline after one particular run that even Horror o Smart would have been proud of. So the first \u00a3\nhalf ended with IC unlucky to have only four |\npoints on the board. S During the second half, UC put our try line under a lot of pressure, but our defence stood\nfirm until, after a line out, the ball bounced\nright to their number eight to dive over for a try. From the restart UC again, put our\ndefence to the test and it was not until twenty\nminutes that UC managed to score again,\nthrough a fine individual run by their winger.\nMany teams would have given up at this point,\nbut not IC Ladies: Under the driving\nleadership of Smelly Shirley, they put in a tremendous fight back and th roush some\ninspired kicking by Hotlips and some\ndetermined forward play, IC were on the\nbrink of scoring when the final whistle blew\nSo the match ended in defeat for IC Ladies,\nbut the performance of the whole team, in\nevery respect, was something to be proud of\nGreat try Ladies!!\nones who support abortions). But then\nwomen never have known their own\nminds.\nCUTS OUT, DEMOS IN, HUMAN\nRIGHTS ADJOURNED\nThe final motion passed was on\neducation cuts when a representative of\nthe Conservative party failed to limit the\nmotion just to the issue of overseas\nstudents fees. By now ICU will already\nhave gone underground and demonstrated but Human Rights\nremained un discussed, but on the\nagenda.\nThe painting that was taken from the Bot Zoo\nCommon Room has still not been returned. The loss\nof the painting is extremely em baras sing to the\ncollege as it was on loan from a good friend of IC,\n^mmm mmm mW m Photo by WAC Mier-Jedrzejowicz\nIC STUDENTS ATTEND EDUCATION\nCUTS PROTEST MARCH\nA contingent of IC students including\nDeputy President of ICU, Malcolm Brain took\npart in the education cuts protest march on\nWednesday.\nThe massive gathering of trade unions,\ncolleges and universities( including Lancaster, Bath, Susses and Essex), schools\nand left-wing political parties began to move\noff from Hyde Park nearly on schedule\nalthough, due to the large numbers present,\nthe IC contingent did not leave until after\n4:00pm. The first union groups arrived at the\nHouse of Parliament at about twenty past\nthree and from that time anyone walking back\nalong the route of the march encountered an\nalmost continuous procession of people,\nbanners and placards. They would also have\nbeen leafletted, pressured to buy various left-wing newspapers and have heard the\nintermittent chants. The march was\nfollowed by a lobbying of MPs.\n\n"

So far\nthis term, these have included a visit to\nthe Airfix factory at Wandesworth, a behind the curtain tour of a major\nbranch of Lloyd's bank and a presentation by Mars on the\nmanufacturing of its products. In all\nour events we try to get at the hard\nfacts behind the organisation: from the\ntechnical, the industrial relations, the\nfinancial and the careers viewpoints. In\nthe case of visits, this means not just a tour of the works but also a critical\ndiscussion with the staff and\nmanagers. We try to cater for a wide\nrange of interests and needs and next\nterm will see such activities as a presentation by Courtaulds and in\nearly February a visit to the Ford\nproduction line at Dagenham. The\nmost immediate of our future events is\na talk by Unilever on the role of the\naccountant in industry, which will take\nplace next Wednesday 13 December in\nthe Bot/Zoo common room. This will\nbe an illustrated talk and refreshments\nwill be provided.

The students are\ntaking seriously reports that President Carter\nwill not stand idly by if the hostages were put\non trial.\nUS EMBASSY IN PAKISTAN\nATTACKED\nThe US Embassy in Pakistan was stormed\nby a mob and one US marine was shot dead.\nThe Americans trapped inside had to be\nrescued by troops ordered into the grounds\nby President Zia. The riots seem to have been\nsparked off by rumours that 'American and\nIsraeli agents' were responsible for the\nseizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca and\nAyatollah Khomeini broadcast a statement\nbacking up the rumour.\nMINERS TO VOTE ON STRIKE\nLeaders of 230,000 miners rejected the 20%\npay offer and called for support for disruptive\naction. A pit head ballot will be held on 30\nNovember and the result will be announced\non 6 December.\nTHURSDAY 22\nFORECASTED DECLINE IN\nECONOMY\nIn the latest Treasury economic forecasts a deficit of \u00a32 billion is projected in 1980,\nalthough inflation is expected to fall from 17%\nto 14% by the end of 1980, the economy is\nexpected to decline by 2%, despite reaching\nself-sufficiency in oil.\nThe mortgage rate is to be increased from\n11 3/4% to a record 15% from January\n1st. This is the biggest ever rise in the cost of\nhome loans and home-buyers face a jump of\nover 20% in monthly mortgage payments.\nCHINESE ACCUSE VIETNAM\nThe Chinese accused the Vietnamese army\nof causing a million deaths in Cambodia and\nhinted that another Chinese invasion of\nVietnam might become necessary soon. The\nChinese de leg at Mr Han Nianlong, at a new\nround of border talks in Peking also accused\nVietnamese for rce s of \"tyrannical rule and\nplundering in Cambodia\" and claimed that\nthe deaths took place during ruthless\n'mopping up' operations and massacres\nAlthough the Vietnamese delegate repeated\ntheir proposal that both sides of the dispute\nshu ld sign a non-aggression agreement, Mr\nHan is reported to have concentrated on\nCambodia.\nBRITISH HEART TRANSPLANT\nThe seventh heart transplant to take place in\nBritain was completed after a six hour\noperation at Papworth Hospital near\nCambridge. The patient is said to be\nbreathing on his own and the heart\nfunctioning well.\nFRIDAY 23\nBL FUTURE IN JEOPARDY\nBL's future was in the balance while the\ncompany considered whether to scrap the\nsurvival plan in the event of strikes in support\nof Mr Derek Robinson being made official. If\nthis happens, management sources said that\nthe BL Board might withdraw its request for\n\u00a3200 million in slate, which would mean more\nredundancies.\nZAMBIAN CRISIS\nFears that the Lancaster House talks could\ncollapse wider the strain of Zambian crisis\nand the deadlock over ceasefire lead to an\na peal by Mrs Thatcher for a quick agreement.\nThe statement said that the achievements\nshould not be jeo pardi sed by 'ill-judged\nactions or decisions'. The talks were 'within\nan ace of success' and that deadlock over\nceasefire could lead to previous decisions\nbeing unravelled.\nIRA MAN GETS LIFE SENTENCE\nThomas McMahon, one of the Provisional\nIRA's bomb makers, was convicted of killing\nEarl Mountbatten in a boat explosion and\nsentenced for life.\nSATURDAY 24\nPOLICE CORRUPTION INQUIRY\nSeveral police officers are expected to be\narrested in the next few weeks in Operation\nCountryman, the biggest ever investigation\ninto London police corruption. Detectives\ninvolved in the operation which has been\nrunning for a year feel that they have been\nprevented from taking action against several\nsuspects. They blame this on the policy of the\n- Director of Public Prosecutions of only rarely\ngiving immunity to informants and on the\nprotective 'immunity' of the London police.\nSo far, one officer has been arrested on a minor charge and seven suspended.\nRABIES JAB\nThe first safe and cheap anti-rabies\ninjection is now available. The vaccine is\nproduced from human tissue and so free from\nforeign body reaction caused by earlier\nvaccines.

Dr Waldheim said\nthat the tension had now esc late d to a point\nwhere the world is facing the most seri us threat since the Cuba missile crisis of 1962.\nMONDAY 26\nHOSPITAL PICKET LINE\nScuffles resulted today when about 200\njunior doctors and nurses staged a counter-demonstration against the picket line at\nCharing Cross Hospital which has been\nrefusing to allow the delivery of any heating\noil. The hospital has been brought near to\nclosure with only 330 patients, 463 empty\nbeds and contingency plans to evacuate the\npatients. An out-patient suffering from throat\nand lung cancer approached the picket line\nand told them that the would die if the did not\nrecieve daily treatment.
