    "content": "Welcome to the Electric Cafe for this\nweek. First of all, don't forget that\ntoday (Friday 2 2 nd May) the Electric\nCafe will be descending on the Union for a whole night at the controls of the chill out room. If you have read the column or listened to the\nradio show and would like to see the cafe in a more \"live\" atmosphere, or if you just want to\ncome down and check out some forward think-ing, relaxed electronic music, then please comedown this week.\nThe main feature of the column this week is\nthe drum'n 'bass outfit King Kooba. Consisting of\ntwo childhood friends (DJ Shuff\nand Charlie Tate), the Koobas\nhave amassed critical acclaim for <\ntheir recent album The Imperial\nSolution, which is out on their own T \u00bb\nlabel, Second Skin Records, i caught up with them and asked Sni them about \"live drum'n 'bass\",\nlife and the universe...\nCan you explain what you do in\nterms of music for people who\nhave never heard of you before?\nShuff: Basically we' ve just\ncompleted our first album, called\nthe Imperial Solution, which is a sort of jazz-orientated dance-style\nalbum. There are a few downbeat\ntracks on it, but basically the main\nconcentration on the first album\nwas a sort of d'n'b style. We' ve been together\nfor about two or three now; working and of late\nprogressing into more of a variety of styles. But\nthe main agenda is a sort of jazz origin.\nSo taking jazz music and pushing it further?\nShuff: Yes.\nWould you describe yourselves as a d'n'b out-fit?\nShuff: Well we're trying to avoid it, but obviously it does happen. Up to this point a lot of\nthe material has been of a d'n'b type but we are\nendeavour ing to widen our spectrum as such\nand work on different styles in the future. We' ve got some big-beat vibes which we are going to\npush through.\nDo you find pressure in that because people\nmight tend to concentrate on one style and\ncriticise you for being too broad?\nShuff: Yeah there is a danger of that, but\nbasically the criteria is that if it is a quality piece\nof music, then whatever vibe it is, it's going to\nget the respect it deserves. If we're going to do something on a big-beat or downbeat level then\nthe chances are that we'll get someone in or do a remix ourselves on a more dancefloor orientated vibe anyway.\nYou're very much a live act. How do you\napproach the live aspect of your music?\nCharlie: I suppose Shuff's the DJ and I come from a more kind of musical background. I was\nplaying live music for years. So it was quite easy\nfor me, despite the fact that it was d'n'b. But\nthere were ways around it and I knew how to\ncrack the live angle. I wouldn't say the live thing\nis particularly faithful to the album but I'm not\nafraid of that. I think that's the whole point. If\nyou're getting musicians involved then they're\ngoing to interpret things and I'm not going to tell\nthem \"You're playing that wrong.\" So lots of\nother things would come out of the fact that that\nit's been taken live and tunes are taking their own direction. I think that's a good thing. I think the\nresult is going to show in the next set of material we put out. We are definitely going to put\nShuff: The main factor is that if we own our\nlabel we can put out the music we want. It\nallows us to keep our artistic morals as such.\nWith jazz being your main influence, why do\nthink that form of music has inspired so many\ndifferent dance mutations, from pure techno\nright through to d'n'b? Shuff: Because the term jazz is a freeform\nstyle of music. It is all about working on certain\nmoods and tonal qualities rather than making\npop tunes. It is more about feeling and how you\ncan throw out the rule book. With jazz there are\nno rules, that's the whole beauty\nJ M^^^^^M of the music. It's a style that has\nmore live input into the recorded material.\nNowadays with the technology in dance music\nyou can play backing tracks off pre-recorded\nDATs and mix sounds off a machine over\nthem. Why do you feel you need to get a real\ndrummer and throw out the backing tracks?\nCharlie: It's basically my dislike of it because\nI 've seen it so many times. People paying\nthrough the nose to see this. OKI know that\npeople will pay to go and see a DJ but I think the\nwhole point of going to see live acts is that in\nessence, it should be a show, and be the real\nthing. I 've been and seen people with a DAT and\nmucking around on top of it on the desk and 1\nfind it offensive actually!\nYou own a record label called Second Skin.\nTell us about that.\nCharlie: We're all partners in the label. It's been established for about eighteen months\nnow and we all have vested interests in it. We own the company, we put out music on the\nlabel and we want to promote the product as\nmuch as possible.\nWith so many labels around nowadays, why\ndid you decide to start your own?\nCharlie: Theoretically we could have taken it\nto any label of that ilk but my personal experience of dealing with record labels is that they\ntake too much control of the situation. It's very\ndifficult. Sometimes you've set something down and you're following a direction and it's perfect\nand the minute they turn and say, \"you can't do this.\"\nWm no boundaries so that is why I II think it slides into the dance\nHj world so well. With any style of\ndance music you can interpret a jazz mood into that style.\nAs a Dj I 've noticed that you\nincorporate many different\nstyles into your set Shuff. Why\nis this?\nShuff: Normally I tend to build\n1 from a sort of jazz-dance/big-beat\n1 introduction for the first half-hour, and then I like to go into the\nsort of jungle jazz sort of things\nand then mould in harder style\nstuff to the middle of the set. But\nbasically I'm not very much into\nplaying one type of music.\nI think for me as a punter going to a club\nthere's nothing worse than a Dj playing one\nstyle, even if he's mixing superbly. I'm not into\nthree hours of drilling music. After a while you\njust want to climb up the walls! It'sO K but the\nDJs not taking you anywhere. This also makes\nsense with the music we make because if I was\na100% jungle DJ then I wouldn't be playing half\nof Kooba's music!\nDo you see Djing as an art form?\nShuff: Last year I was in Belgium and I saw\nJuan Atkins playing. I'd never seen him before\nbut I'd heard his records and heard he is an\namazing Dj. From about the second track in you\ncould see that this guy was electric! He was\nbasically playing with three decks, but in a way\nthat he was rewinding certain elements of tunes\nand they just kept on coming back during the\nset. It was amazing. You could see how he was\ninjecting these little things back into his set. He\nwas using his decks as musical instruments, so\nin that case, yes!\nMany thanks to King Kooba (DJ Shuff +\nCharlie) and also Emily, Klaus and Anton at Main\nSource for setting up the interview! You can hear\nthe whole interview and also an hour long mix if\nyou tune into the Electric Cafe this Sunday night\nfrom midnight till 2 am the next morning.\nal;ck.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 22 May1998 V&A \"Boilerhouse\nat Last Hurdle\nrr\nNews in Brief.\nDAVID ROBERTS\nDesigns for the Victoria & Albert\nMuseum enter the final planning\nstage this week, amid a flurry of\ncriticism.\nThe design, a high-tech structure\nknown as \"the Spiral\" or more critically \"the Boilerhouse\", has led to its\narchitect, Daniel Libeskind, being\ndescribed as \"architecture's Pol Pot\".\nCritics claim that the new building will be a blot on the classical\nbuildings that surround it, viewing\nthe design as \"an explosion in a cardboard box factory\". Libeskind,\nhowever, is used to such criticism.\nHis previous work includes Berlin's Jewish Museum, which led to the\nyoung Polish architect being branded\nthe \"destroyer of Berlin\". His design\nincludes seven great \"voids\", and\nthe entire structure is based around\nlines plotted from the museum to\nthe homes of 1050 pre-war Jews.\nYet his design for the \u00a3 7 5 million\npound extension to the current\nmuseum is utterly different. It is a futuristic plan, designed to create\nthe correct setting for the museum's huge selection of contemporary art.\nBy utilising NASA computer technology, the he has created a seven\nstorey building, coated in massive\nceramic tiles, yet with no internal\nframework. Libeskind describes it as\n\"unlike any spiral that's ever been\nbuilt, because there's not a centre or\na single apex...it's a vertical slice\nthrough time\".\nThe design brief called for something that would make a \"hugely\navant garde statement about the\nsite\" - and the project director,\nGwyn Miles, feels that the design\nLibeskind produced was \"spot on\". In an unprecedented move, the brief\nalso insisted that the new building\nwould have to be capable of lasting\nanother 120 years. Consequently,\nLibeskind has produced something\nwhich he believes will fit into the\ntwenty-first century, \"a craft and a culture for eternity\".\nThe plans go to the Royal\nBorough of Kensington &. Chelsea\nplanning committee this week, and if\ngiven the go-ahead, building work\nwill commence in earnest later this\nyear.\nLEAGUE TABLES\nImperial has once again been\nplaced third in The Times university league table, published last\nweek. Cambridge was top, with\nOxford beating Imperial into third\nplace by just three points out of a possible thousand. In The\nFinancial Times table, published\nearlier this month, Imperial came\nsecond with Oxford top. What\nmakes The Times table interesting,\nif not dubious, is Imperial's score\nof 85 for research, much lower\nthan previous years and placing it\neleven points behind Oxford. Imperial kept its third place by\nscoring a high 93 in the staff-stu-dent category and a maximum100 for facilities spending, a finding that will no doubt please the\ncollege and bemuse many stu-dents. Other London universities\nin the top ten were the London\nSchool of Economics and Political\nScience and University College,\nwith King's College being placed\n18th. The change in Imperial's 'strong' categories from last year,\ncoupled with the marked differences between different league\ntables, can only fuel doubts as to\nthe worth and even validity of the\nleague table system.\nBIOCHEM FLOOD\nFlooding occurred on three levels\nof the Department of Biochemistry\nlast Friday when the hose to a water pump on an overnight\nexperiment split. The sink below\nhad become blocked and, as a consequence, water spilled out\ninto the lab and adjoining corridor\nand then down to the two levels\nbelow, where the departmental\nstores are located. Fortunately\nmost of the stock in the affected\narea was salvaged. The flooding\nwas discovered by Security early\nFriday morning. The Departmental\nSuperintendent, Mick Rogers,\ndeclined to comment, saying that\nthis sort of thing happens every\nday. He did say, however, that in\nhis opinion there are not enough\npeople around at that time to look\nout for faults in equipment used in\nexperiments.\nRl\nFriday az. freema/ a after KGDonizm\nChunky club tunes with.\nGclectic electronic^ from...\nSaturday STANDING HOOM ONIY\nEngland v Saudi Arabia\nIJ Tuesday STA BAR TRIVIA\nW Win \u00a3 5 0 or a crate of lager.

    "content": "20 SPORT 22 May 1998\nYou're Going Down with the Bookstore!\n\"We serve beer in proper glasses!\nWe serve beer in proper glasses!\"\n\"Our girls are better looking! Our\ngirls are better looking!\"\n\"What's it like to, what's it like to,\nwhat's it like to serve crap beer?\"\nWhatever else may be said about\nSouthside's male footballers, they\nwere certainly in good voice during\nthe girls' five-a side match. Banners emblazoned \"Scrubbers\",\n\"Peasants\" and \"Union Scum\" were\nproduced and waved angrily at\ntheir counterparts on the opposite\ntouch line. They would have their\nsay later.\nThe match itself was a largely\none sided affair. The Union Staff's girls broke forward in the first\nminute allowing Amy Seal to score,\nand remained solidly camped in the\nSouthside half. On the rare occasion that the ball found its way into\nthe Union's half, the Union selection policy of picking girls on their\nability to run and quite often kick\nrather than their appearance in\ntight shorts seemed increasingly\nwise. Thanks to some fine goal-keeping and downright hilarious\nrefereeing from bald y Southside\nregular Martin Ramsey, the Prince's Gardens mob kept the game at 1 -0, almost sneaking the draw in the\ndying seconds, but the result was\nnever in serious doubt.\nThe real business of the day\nwas about to begin. Southside's central defence hadn't turned up.\nTheir captain went round pleading\nwith his team mates to put out\ntheir cigarettes. The Union looked\nas if they might have been pr act is ing. It all started looking a little\nominous. None of the Union players were wearing sunglasses, and\nthe possibility that they were taking\nthe whole thing seriously started\nbecoming horribly real.\nA goal from the first attack set\nthe tone for the match. A mis-hit\nshot from the Union's Dave\nWharton went sideways from six\nyards, stranding the already committed goalkeeper allowing Ian\nRichards to tap into the unguarded\nnet from close range. He scored\nagain soon after; a right wing cross\nfound him unmarked on the back\npost, and his low volley left\nSouthside's keeper, Felix's own Jonathan Trout, with little chance.\nNeil Eady got the third five\nminutes before half time; the ball\nforced over the line from under a foot after a near post corner was\nnot cleared. Southside mounted several attacks of their own, mostly through midfielder Nick Helliwell\nand winger Alan Ross, but the final\nball to the front two was never\nquite up to scratch.\nA tactical switch at half time by\nSouthside evened the game up\nthoroughly, with Charlie Cunnell\nbringing steel to the central\ndefence and Mike Peach ment bringing some lovely bruises to the\nlegs of the Union's right winger. As tiredness set in, both sides started\nmaking chances, but solid goal-keeping at both ends denied any\naddition to the score until ten minutes from full time, where an unfortunately deflected clearance fell to\nthe feet of the Union captain Gerry\nDonahoe, who turned and blasted\nhome from six yards unchallenged,\ndespite justifiable claims of offside\nfrom the Southside defence. The\nSouthsiders almost scored a last\nminute consolation goal after a lengthy goal mouth scramble involving late arrival Gareth Parry, fresh\nfrom a mere 4 8 hour stag party in\nEdinburgh, but were denied once\nmore by the safe hands of Seb\nNorager.\nJames \"Ref\" Vallance blew the\nfinal whistle to signify a comfortable four goal victory, and the\nteams trudged off to Prince's Gardens for post match gloating,\nboat racing (Southside 2 - 0 Union),\nsinging, beer fights and an unfortunate incident with the barbecue\nand a Hooch bottle full of petrol.\nOh, and the Southside girls were\nbetter looking.\nA Nice Cup\nIC CRICKET II v ST\nGEORGE'S II\nIt was a surreal scene amidst the\ndebris in Beit quad at noon on\nSunday, no hail, no rain, not even\nany wind and a full complement of\nplayers. In fact we were so surprised to have eleven men that we\nleft Andy behind. Instead of doing\nthe sensible thing and awaiting our\nreturn in the bar he ran behind the\nminibus for a good15 minutes,\nwhile we scoured the South Kensington streets. Nice to see a bit of desire to play though.\nUpon arrival we were greeted\nby the opposition informing us that\nthey had been bowled out for 21 in\ntheir last match. This was treated\nas sneaky gamesmanship, after all\ntheir firsts had lost only narrowly to\nIC firsts in the UL U cup final last\nseason. The captain won the toss\nand put them in, electing to open the bowling with a leg spinner.\nThey hadn't been joking, we bowled them out for 10, even after\nthe opening bowlers had been\ntaken off. Three wickets apiece for\nNim, Alex and JP. 101! Even Mike of Tea\nAtherton averaged more than that\nin the West Indies!\nOur batting was less imposing,\nbut so was their bowling and we\nsoon rattled up 101-9 declared,\nmost of the runs coming from\nGo pi. Then they had another go\nand this time got 47 against our\npart time bowlers. Rushi took a fantastic five wickets and IC seconds had a famous victory made all\nthe more unbelievable by the\nsuperb weather and the fact that\nfor the first time in living memory\nIC didn't drop any catches.\nThe opposition were a great\nbunch of blok es and their teas were\nfantastic, ice creams, what luxury.\nWe are therefore going to have\nanother match, but this time with\nmixed teams, if IC can find half a dozen girls. No experience, or skill\nnecessary, because George's don't have any. If there is anybody interested please e mail Peter\n(p.f ranke@ ic.ac.uk), or Andi (a. fer-gus on@ ic.ac.uk).\n10 runs, fancy a cricket team\ngetting a football score!\nSHOOTERS TAKE\nTHE CUP\nAfter the Materials department\nscored 24/24 for teaching quality a final year student proves they really are the best by winning the West\nKent Rifle League Presidents Cup. Jon Mc Cartney beat over 50 other\nrifle shooters to take the cup with\nhis best ever performance by far.\nMark Carter came a creditable 4\nand some good scores were put in\nby the other shooters from IC with\nour top lady, Neela Das gaining her\nfirst ever standards medal.\nJon refused to be interviewed\nby \"Felix\" having signed a deal with\n\"Channel One News\" said to be\nworth as much as \u00a35 for his exclusive story. However, he will be\nparading around the campus in an\nopen topped bus showing off his\ncup just as soon as he gets it back\nfrom the pawnbrokers. It can be\nreported that none of the IC\nshooters failed the mandatory drugs test and even Jake Thome\nhad more drugs than the minimum specified amount. All that training\nin Southside on a diet of Caffreys\nand pork scratching s really has\npaid off this year with two cups\nand a dozen standards medals to\nImperial College Rifle and Pistol\nClub's credit.\nFORMULA I PIT\nSTOP CHALLENGE\nThe Andersen Consulting Pit Stop\nChallenge takes place on Friday 29\nin Beit Quad, allowing teams of\nstudents to get their hands on a Williams Formula One car. The\nwheel changing exercise is a com petition for mind and body, involving teamwork and logical thought,\nqualities that have made Andersen\none of the world's leading business\nconsultants.\nFor the past 3 seasons,\nAndersen Consulting have been in\npartnership with Williams, using\ntheir skills to maximise Williams'\nexcellence in the field of motor\nracing. In these three years,\nAndersen has helped Williams\nassess it's current position, identified future business opportunities,\nand developed a winning strategy.\nIf you want to be part of the Pit\nStop Challenge, apply at the Union\nOffice by Wednesday. No applications to take part will be accepted\non the day. If you think changing\nwheels sounds too much like hard\nwork, then there'll be a giant\nscale xt ric, plus a barbecue and the\nbar will be open all day. Andersen\nConsulting will of course have a graduate recruitment stand on the\nday.\n\n"

He also releases\nus ic( the majority of his DJing material is his\nown records) under two labels, Axis and Purpose Maker. He claims that the material on\nAxis signifies music for the mind, and the output\non Purpose Maker corresponds to the mechanical parts of the body; for example the hands\nwhich are the main DJing tools!\nJeff's back catalogue is mostly on a vinyl-only format, so it was a great relief to non-DJ\ndance fans when React Records decided to\nlicense and release the highlights of each label.\nThe Axis compilation is already out (entitled The\nOther Day). Next week sees the release of\nPurpose Maker. Both albums follow on from the\nnow-classic Live At The Liquid Rooms CD which\ngave many the chance to sample Jeff's unique\nthree deck DJing abilities.\nThe album begins with The Dancer, a funky\nhybrid of techno meets folk music (that's honestly the best way I can describe it). This has a very bumpy jumpy sound and is suitable as pure\ntechno but is not so clean or minimal as the\nnorm.\nCasa is the next track and is actually lifted\nfrom the Axis label, but an EP which was called\nPurpose Maker and marked the begin of this\nseries. This track features hypnotic rhythms that\nare not quite fluid but won't let you escape once\nyou're in the groove!\nThe Bells is one of Jeff's hardest offerings\nsince his early work on pioneering Detroit label\nUnderground Resistance. When he played this\nat the End last year it left everybody gasping.\nReverting is the second track to be lifted\nfrom the Axis Purpose Maker EP. Many regard\nthat record to be Jeff's finest work to date.\nReverting contains more funky looped rhythms.\nA sort of xylophone sound comes in midway and\nthe effect is electrifying!\nMy personal favourite track is Alarms. A very\nsimple track, this consists of a looped sample\nover a very funky beat. This works as house or\ntechno and has an infectious groove.\nThere are some slower and deeper tracks on\nthis compilation. Check out Medicine Man for\none example of such a track. It is one of a group\nof unreleased tracks on the album. So you can\neven be one up on the vinyl DJs by owning this!\nThe tribal nature of some of the Purpose\nMaker releases is also apparent here. Check out\nParadise, a more dirty sounding track with a shuffling rhythm and heavy bass. Masterplan is\nalmost completely percussive. The rhythms are\nled and cut up by fierce stabs of breakbeat s. This\nis hard and dark and dangerous!\nThe Purpose Maker compilation is not music\nto be messed with, and may be lost on many\npeople, but there is no denying it will please all\nhis fans and anyone who is curious enough to\nwant to check out the psyche of this modem day musical hero.\nal;ck.\nr HAIRSALON\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT & BLOW DRY\nBY OUR TOP STYLISTS\n\u00a315 LADIES\n\u00a313 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nmm\nTelephone 0171 823 8968\nJCR\nCATERING SERVICES\nDue to refurbishment of the Junior\nCommon Room during the summer,\nplease note that the BREAKFAST SERVICE and CURRY BAR will be\ntransferred to the M DH( Main Dining\nHall) on 8 June until the end of term -26 June.\n\"QT\" and the Vending service will\ncontinue in the JCR, although there\nwill be NO SEATING.\nWe regret any inconvenience to JCR\ncustomers.\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES "

    "content": "22 May 1998 ARTS 17 I DANCING AND SHOCKING\nDANCE IN LONDON T his time of year is one of the\nmost exciting in the art scene\nof London, for the contemporary dance fans amongst us.\nThere are some major festivals\nfrom May right into August.\nThe first of these festivals started at the end of April and has just\nfinished: it was called Spring Loaded. I won't extend myself on it. It is a showcase of some of the\nbest companies across the world,\nand also the best talent working in\nBritain. The highlights were Javier\nde Frutos's latest offering called\nCrass, an exploration of love. A man has to choose between his\nfemale lover and this man who is\ntrying to attract him away from her.\nAnother interesting company, CAN DO CO from Canada was also\nfeatured. This is a very interesting\ncompany with seven dancers, three\nof them in wheelchairs. The result\nis strongly emotional and thought-provoking. If you have a chance to\ncatch these people, go for it.\nThere is lots more coming up,\nstarting this week. The Turning\nWorld festival at the Place Theatre\nand the Royal Festival Hall, for a start. This is a showcase of\nEuropean companies, this year\nmainly concentrating on Belgium\nand Portugal. Four choreographers,\nall based in Lisbon, are here with\ntheir latest work. The best two are\nPaulo Ribeiro on 2 2 nd and 23rd May and Vera Montero on 17th June. There are two must-see companies from Belgium, Rosas on22 nd May, ie tonight, and Les\nBallets C de la Bon 12th and 13th June. Rosas is the creation of Anne\nTeresa De Keersmaeker; her style is\nvery different and quite difficult to\nrelate to at times but, in the end,\nimmensely rewarding. Les Ballets C de la B are Alain Platel's ideas. I think that this guy is one of the\nmost brilliant choreographer-dire c tors around. His ideas defy any-one's imagination, and the results\nare always so inventive, hilarious\nand important. This year he's presenting \"lets op Bach\", with nine\ndancers and a chamber baroque\norchestra. He is one of the rare\nbreed that manages to take dance\nonto another level by mixing it with\nother art forms. Finally, for those of you who will be here over the summer, the\nRoyal Festival Hall continues its\nDance and Performance programme. Don't miss Trilok Gurtu,\nthe jazz percussionist who will be\nplaying from his brilliant new album, on the 25th July.\nIf you need anymore information about any of these events,\ncome into the office and ask Julia.\nWatch this space from now on if\nyou like contemporary dance. There will be lots of reviewing\ngoing on. D. CLEANSED Royal Court Theatre\nI don't really know how to start\nthis review. Cleansed is one of\nthose plays that keep you thinking for a long time. I have to\nsay it: this play is fantastic.\nLet me explain the story a little.\nThe scene is set in an university,\nalthough no details are really given\nin the text. The beginning of the\nplay is a succession of extremely\nstrong scenes that actually make\none feel quite nauseous. That feeling only lasts a couple of seconds,\nhowever. The characters are all the\n'undesirables' of our society,\nlooked after by Tinker, a \"doctor\"\nwho is more like a hardcore sadist,\ninflicting the most degrading treatment onto his patients. He escapes\nall this by going to see the local\nstripper.\nSome of the worst atrocities\nare committed to the sound of a musical box. I 'll let you imagine the\neffect of that. The recurring theme,\nespecially between boyfriends Carl\nand Rod, is trust or the lack of it.\nCarl wants Rod to give him his ring\nas avow of commitment, but ultimately betrays him. All of these\npeople are trying to survive in these\nawful conditions through love: this\ngives rise to some very tender and\ntouching situations that beautifully\nclash with the violence of their\ndaily lives. Grace starts teaching\nRobin how to write in a lovely\nscene of innocent love, which in\nthe end has disastrous consequences. The director, James Macdonald( he also directed Sarah Kane's debut play Blasted) does marvelous work using some great\nimages to represent the violence.\nTogether with the designer, they\nhave created everyday settings\nwith a particular context, but that\ncould be transposed anywhere. It is\nall extremely clever and gives the\nplay that added impact. The text\nitself is very elliptic with not a single word is wasted, making for a sense of concentration and importance. The actors have a very\nstrong role in their physical presence, talking as little as possible,\nand letting expressions and movements do the rest. And this totally\nworks.\nMorally speaking, Cleansed is\nhard to watch. One does feel like\none is intruding on something, but\nisn't that an exciting feeling? The\nplay is a challenge to everyone; is\nSarah Kane just showing us a slightly exaggerated view of our mirror\nimage to make us react? I will say it\nagain: this play is fantastic, one of\nthe landmarks of these past years\nin the same vein as Trainspotting\nand Shopping and Fucking. It\ncomes as some sort of revelation\nand makes themes like incest,\nhomosexuality and abuse seem less distant. I urge everyone to go\nand see it even if it sounds re pul sive. It is a lesson in theatre and\ncan change quite a few things in\none's life....\nD.I PUGNI IN T AS CA ICA Cinema from 29 May\nhair beautifully set, with her sunglasses and side-long glances, of\nthe girls in La Dolce Vita, even think\nof Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at\nTiffany's, and you will have the\nlook.\nIt is worth going to see this film,\nbecause it shows another slice of\nlife, one that will make you very\nglad that this is not your family. It is\nnot an easy film, many of the ideas\nare extremely disturbing. For non-Italian speakers, it has subtitles, so\nthere is no excuse for not seeing it.\nT his film (Fists in the Pocket in\nEnglish) didn't disappoint me\nin the slightest. It is a powerful drama about a completely dysfunctional family, with 3 epileptic\nchildren, Giulia, Leon and Alessandro, a blind widowed moth er, and a young man, Augosto,\nstruggling to support his family\nwhilst trying to remain sane. Giulia\nis jealous of her brother's ability to\nattract love, and sends his fiancee,\nLucia, anonymous letters and hate\nmail. She has an almost in ces to us relationship with her brother\nAlessandro which is always hinted\nat, never described explicitly. The\nsecond brother, Alessandro, decides to help his brother by murdering the rest of his family, thus\nenabling him to build up a better\nlife in the town with his fiancee.\nThe story deals with the gradual\nrealisation of Ale's actions by his\nsister and brother.\nThis is a harrowing and\npoignant account of the collapse of\na family. Filmed in the sixties in\nItaly in the hills above Rome, it has\nrecently been re-mastered, and is\nbeing shown at the ICA later this\nmonth. The director, Marco Bellocchio, is Italian and this was\nhis debut film. When it was first\nreleased, this film caused controversy over its portrayal of a collapsing family unit, in particular over\nthe blind and therefore helpless\nmother. In Italy at that time, the\nfamily was seen as integral to the\nfabric of Italian society, with the\nmother as a central Madonna esque figure, holding the reins of\npower in her calm and efficient\nhands. This film can be regarded as\nan example of the late neo-realism\nschool of film-making, with professional actors used instead of amateurs due to its content, and graphic portrayal of collapse. As in many\nItalian neo-realism films, it can't have a happy ending.\nThe acting, direction and cinematography are all flawless and,\ndespite the film being in Italian, it is\nan enjoyable experience. The\nactresses are all extremely be a uti ful, classy-looking Italian brunettes,\nelegantly dressed.

The conspiracy meister has\nmarked out young director Stabile\nas someone possessing the flair\nworthy of a break in Hollywood, and has allowed his name to be\nattached to the project, in return\nfor Stabile getting enough cash to\nproduce his first film. Sadly, how ever, Stone clearly isn't that pop u lar in Hollywood at present, as his\nillustrious name only secured$5000 for Cravesend.\nThe resulting film shows glimpses of the talent that Stone\nseems to have identified - particularly the fast, non linear editing\nwhich chops between actions and their aftermath. However, the\nwhole thing is undermined by the\namazingly low budget. Shot on camcorder and on the streets, the\nrealism is undeniable. Yet the grain-in ess and jerkin ess of the picture is\nlight years behind what the cinema\ngoing public have come to expect.\nThe plot mixes elements of\nTaking low budget to a whole new dimension.\nShallow Crave and Cridlock'd, as\nfour teenagers accidently kill some-one, and then try to dispose of the\ncorpse. What results is a strange\nmix of textbook gritty realism and\nan absurd chain of events which\nborder on farce.\nYet, despite all the merits of the\nediting, writing and directing, the\ncheapness of the production pervades every second.

    "content": "22 May 1998 MUSIC\nALBUMS\nSEAN LENNON\nInto The Sun\nOn18 th May, Sean Lennon\nreleased Into The Sun. On the same day, Julian\nLennon released Photograph Smile.\nHowever fabricated this turn of\nevents may be, the outcome can be\ngood for only one of the half-broth-ers. By now, they are used to being\nsecond best to their late father.\nWhat was his name, again? Jason?\nJack? Ringo? Anyway, it doesn't matter. The point is that they are\nboth used to coming second best\nto one Lennon. What's it going to\nbe like coming second best to a second rate version of your dad?\nFrivolous complex constructing\naside, it does seem that the half-brothers are destined to have comparisons made with their name-sake s. Julian's album has been prom o ted better over here in the UK and Julian has been blessed/cursed\nwith almost the same voice as his\nfather. These factors will probably\nresult in a higher position for\nPhotograph Smile come the album\ncharts. But while Julian may have\ninherited the vocal chords, Sean\nhas had the greater fortune in\nreceiving his father's unwillingness\nto be bounded musically. Into The\nSun is an exploration into different\nmusical territories tied together by\nSean's distinctive voice. At times,\nhis voice sounds a bit distant,\nthough. It's as if he is detaching\nhimself from his own lyrics, afraid\nto really think too deeply about his\nsubject matter while performing it.\nThis is painfully clear on the melancholic Wasted where the smoky,\nafter hours piano entangles itself\nwith the only lyric, \"It's all but a waste to be in love.\" Bittersweet is\nnot the word. Well, actually it is,\nbut you know what I mean. Other\nflash points are the poppy and\nwonderfully reminiscent Breeze,\nthe jazz instrumental,\nPhotosynthesis and the wander\ninto Country territory that is Part\nOne of The Cowboy Trilogy, which\nis surprisingly captivating. No, seri-ou sly, it is.\nSean has produced a diverse\ncollection of experimental yet still\naccessible songs and deserves all\nthe success that he probably won't get. Julian's album may sell a lot\nmore than Sean's but I think we\nknow who the best Lennon really is.\nOr should that be was? d Dennis\nSINGLES\nKenickie - / Would Fix You\nYou've probably heard this song without knowing it, mainly because it doesn't sound like a Kenickie song. Gone are the shout y bum fluff songs like Punka. I Would Fix You shows a newfound sense of (whisper it) maturity. That does-n't mean this song is a tired dirge. In fact, it's great. Perfect for this time of year with its \" sum mer's coming\" vibe.\nThe Pecadiloes - Kirs ten's Bench\nAn indie song that walks down the same path as\nThe Eels, Kirsten's Beach shows promise for\ntheir forthcoming album. Contains the wonderful line \"Iam running to my girlfriend, 'cos she\nloves me for being wrong.\" Liberty 37 - Stuffed F..P. Using the same growling guitar riff as every\nheavy metal wannabe, these tracks fail to stick\nin the brain. Good vocals, however, stop this\nfrom being trash.\nSuper Furry Animals - Ice Hockey Hair E.P. Exceptional song title. And the songs are even\nbetter. This E.P. comprises tracks left over from\ntheir Radiator album, which shows what a formidable songwriting talent the SFA's are. Ice\nHockey Hair is wonderful, containing everything\nthat any song could ever have: gripping intro,\nhaunting verses with the expected obscure\nlyrics, propelling chorus akin to Pet Sounds,\nsing-a long repeated refrain and the usual\nassortment of strange sounds. Oh, and opening\ntrack Smokin' is superb as well.\nMica Paris - Stay\nReturn of the early '90s soul diva. Her vocals are\nas impressive as ever but the track suffers from\npoor songwriting and predictable production.\nUltra Living - Homesick\nObviously influenced by Massive Attack,\nHomesick is a stunning vocal and musical per-form ance, tinged with the urban simplicity of\nArrested Development\nMidget - The Day Of Your Life\nAs with previous single Invisible Balloon, the\npre-pubescent singer ruins an otherwise great\nsong, half Shed Seven, half Dodgy.\nEd\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON The Delagados - Pull the Wires from the Wall\nEighteen months ago The Delgados were just\nanother Scottish Pavement tribute band. They\njust happened to own Chemikal Underground,\nand so have been allowed the space to develop\ninto a truly beautiful prospect. Pull the Wires,\nlike their previous single, is dominated by the\nsweet voice of Emma Pollock whose sour lyrics\nmake for a gorgeous contrast. Mauron Chanson\nis more standard fare, but still bounces along in\na way Bis will always be too annoying to really\npull off as effectively as this.\nCrandaddy - Summer Here Kids\nFrank Black must be kicking himself. Grandaddy\nappropriate his nasal wail and surf-punk chorus-es, and do a much better job with them too. The\nreal gem here is Levitz, though, which slow-bums to a roaring Laptop conclusion after some particularly unhappy falsetto vocals. Get the\nQuaaludes in and wallow.\nGold Blade - 16 Tons\nMore soul-punk stuff from the self-proclaimed\nsaviours of Hard Bop. Sounds more like piss-weak ska-revivalist bollocks to me.\nUltrasound - Stay Young\nLike labelmates Suede, Ultrasound have got a pretty good line in ham my epics that have all\nthe requisite crashing guitars and overwrought\nvocals. It's all well and good, especially as I'm occasionally partial to a bit of Wish You Were\nHere-era floyd, but the chorus of \" My advice to\nall you boys and all you girls is never try to be\nold / I wanna stay young\" is terribly patronising,\nand smacks of the mid-life desperation of a wannabe pop star. Being young is shit. End of\nstory. Now go and get a life.\nMoloko - The Flipside\nLeather pants so tight they had to be sprayed\non. Hips that swing with metro no mic precision.\nEnough beats to work up a little sweat. The\nvoice of a cat who's just supped the sweetest of\ncreams. Oh God, I think I'm ready pass the\nKleenex, Mother. Barry Adamson - Can't Get Loose\nAs good as anything on the class Oedipus\nScmoedipus LP. Essentially it's Nick Cave does\ndisco, the songs underpinned by an entertain-ing, and usually very seedy, narrative. But the\nway Barry swings into the chorus is pure Vegas\n- the new Sinatra, anyone?\nUrusei Yatsura - Slain by Elf\nWorrying Tolkien theme fortunately restricted to\nthe title alone, Urusei Yatsura are still doing\nSonic Youth better than they ever did them-selves, and are clearly having a( teenage) riot in\nthe process. Doesn't quite live up to the live\nexperience, but then we can't have sweaty sixteen year olds crowd-surfing in our bedrooms all\nthe time, can we? H Norm\n\n"

    "content": "NOTICES AND EDITORIAL 22 May 1998\nAnd now the end is here,\nand he has faced the final\ncurtain. The death of\nFrank Sinatra brings to an\nend the career of one of the greatest popular musicians of the twentieth century. He achieved the rare\nfeat of huge popularity across a number of generations by the sheer\nmagnificence of his voice. To list the\nman's repertoire would fill this\nentire copy of Felix, but he will, of\ncourse, be most remembered for\nthe an the mic My Way and Theme\nfrom New York New York, known to\nsingers at the other end of the artistic scale the world over. Indeed, I myself have been known to sing a few bars in a few bars in my unmistakable mellifluous tones. Along with Elvis and John Lennon, Frank\nwas a master. As Max Miller\nremarked, there'll never be another.\nIt would require supreme self-restraint for an opponent of this\ngovernment not to take a modicum of delight in the shambles surrounding the arms to Sierra Leone\nepisode. The parallels with the\narms to Iraq saga are striking,\nthough the attitude of Robin Cook and other members of the Cabinet\nseems to have changed a little\nsince the Scott Report. Cook's volt e face is truly breathtaking. It\nwas abundantly clear to most people that his political flair have\nchange dramatically( for the HI\nworse), but it J jT seems that views\nand principles\nhave undergone\nan even greater HQ\ntransformation. In\nthe Scott Report - > | r* debate, undoubtedly his finest\nhour, when he\ninflicted consider- \u2022\nable damage on the Conservatives,\nhe said that it would be disgraceful\nif Civil Servants were dismissed for\nmistakes made by ministers. So\nwhat does he do over Sandline's arms sales to Sierra Leone? He\nblames Foreign Office staff for failing to brief him, only to be contradicted by the Permanent Secretary,\nwho, sensing the embarrassment of\nthe situation, reluctantly admitted\nthat Cook was being less than honest with Parliament. The Foreign\nSecretary and one of his junior\nMinisters failed to agree on the\ndate they became aware of\nSandline's actions, further indicating suspicious behaviour. Cook has\na rather patron is S~i \u2014 i ing obsession\n\\ ^ with 'the bigger\n. ^ T\" picture.' One has\n' \u00bb I to ask what this\nmeans, if po ten it i al breaches of\n\u2022 * \u2022 UN arms e mbar~! goes are seen as\nH) trifling details.\n\u2022 Some of his of fi y^J cia ls have suggested that he is\n^ \"| more concerned\nwith his private\nlife and its reporting in the media,\nwhich is not a happy state of affairs\nfor a Cabinet minister. It is difficult\nto say, at this stage, whether he\nshould resign, simply because he\nhas been so evasive, moving from a position of blanket denial to claiming all the credit for the restoration\nof President Kabbah, when in fact\nthe principal assistance was given\nby the Nigerian army. The easier\nquestion to answer is whether Cook\nshould be moved in the summer\nreshuffle. Yes. He has demonstrated\nnone of the skill required for one of\nthe trickiest Cabinet jobs, leaving\ndestruction in his wake on several of\nhis foreign trips, and has shown precisely the type of arrogance he has\ncriticised in others. He must go, but\n1 don't envy Tony Blair, who will\nhave to find a replacement from a Cabinet so full of mediocrity.\nIt would seem that my army of\nscouts slightly missed the mark\nwhen they gave me the form for\nSouthside/Union football extra va ganza. The Union boys did rather\nwell at kicking the old pigskin\naround Hyde Park, winning 4-0. My congratulations and sincere apologies for doubting you. But, I stand\nby my comments on drinking,\nchaps. Team boat race to\nSouthside and a second, five man\ncompetition to the denizens of\nPrinces Gardens. To be fair, they\ndid have the assistance of some\nblok e called Baker in the second\none, but since he spends as much\ntime in Southside as most of the\nstaff, it seems fair enough.\nHDD3 La] Barbecues\nAs even the most work-a holi c amongst us\nmust have noticed, it's sunny. That means it\nmust be BBQ season. As every male knows\neverything there is to know about barbecuing 1\nthought I'd stick my little oar in too.\nYou'll need something to barbecue in. You\ncould go and buy one of those pre-packed, pre-coaled and pre-tee expensive ready-made BBQ s from a superstore. But then you' d be a silly\ntwo nk with too much money, no sense and no\nspirit of adventure (Ohh, Ido love making ene-mies). Or you could buy a semi-proper stand-up\nmetal jobs that you put up yourself (much much easier to construct than those flat-pack bookshelves from IKEA) which are reasonably cheap\nand actually reusable. However, my preferred\nsolution by far is to make one. It's a piece of\ncake, costs nothing and really gets those\nprimeval cave hugging juices going. All you need\nare six (6) bricks and a grill from the a) oven b) grill c) fridge d) railings for those really big steaks.\nStack the bricks up into 2 little walls, slap the grill\non top and there you go.\nAs for fuel, it really has to be charcoal in\nLondon. This is readily available in petrol stations\nand comer shops. I think lump wood charcoal is\nbetter than the reconstituted stuff but that may be\npure pretentiousness. Nothing beats paper and\nkindling (broken kitchen chairs or banister spinners are perfect and should be readily available by\nthis time of the year) for lighting a fire and neither\nsmell as horrible nor cost as much as commercially available lighting fluids.\nBarbecuing is a quick and intense way of\ncooking things so you need thin, succulent items.\nPork and lamb chops or ribs, well marbled (ie\ncontaining thin streaks of fat) beef steaks and fillets are ideal. Don't bother with cheap o burgers\nand b angers: if they're crap to start with, they'll\nend up crap. More exotically, try lamb kidneys or\nliver. I 've never found chicken ideal for barbecues\nas the breasts end up completely dry and drumsticks take for ever and end up proverbially incinerated on the outside and raw and stringy on the\ninside. Fish on the other hand are superb especially fatty ones such as mackerel, haddock and\nas mentioned last week, sardines. Salmon is also\nsplendid although, as they tend to be quite thick,\nneed advanced techniques. I'm working myself\nup to doing a suckling piglet but haven't quite got\nthere yet. Above all, don't forget that vegetables\nare excellent barbecued. Phat fleshy ones like\naubergine (see last week's), courgette, peppers\nand tomatoes work really well and make a healthy contrast to the meats. Trick of the trade:\nslice them up, string them on a stick and wham bam you've got a kebab.\nThe final part of the jigsaw is marinating.\nThere are several points to this. The traditional\nreason for marinating meat is to make it tender\nby breaking down the fibres using culinary acids\nsuch as vinegar, lemon juice and shite wines.\nSecondly, marinades add loads of flavour which\ncan mask any nasty tastes in spoilt or off meat\nwhich hopefully shouldn't be a problem these\ndays. Thirdly, a suitable marinade glazes the\npiece and keeps the inside nii iii iii iii ice and moist.\nThere's basically an unlimited range of marinades\nthat you can concoct with whatever you have in\nyour cupboards but here are a few of my\nfavourites (quantities obviously vary with the\nnumber of chops involved):\nHoney and Mustard:\n\u00ae\" 1 part grainy mustard\n*\" 1 part runny honey\nMix the two up and coat liberally. If this starts\nburning on the grill just slap some more on.\nSweet and Sour:\n\"~ 1 part soy sauce\n*\" 1 part malt vinegar\n\u00ab\" 1 t bl five spice powder\nHerb and Lemon:\njuice of 1 lemon\n*\" several pinch ful s of herbs de provence\n\u00ab\" salt and pepper\nThemes and variations, that's the key.\nRemember that marinating implies soaking the\nmeat for a good while (a couple of hours should\ndo it) so be patient and turn or baste the pieces\nso they get evenly treated.\nIn the mellow haze when you're fully stuffed\nand the bottles are getting empty consider bunging a few bananas (skins and all) into what's left\nof the coals for around 10 minutes. They'll cook\nin their own juices and become succulent ly mushy. Mmm mm h!A great opportunity to burn\nyour fingers as you peel them.\n\n"

One such story this week was the\nClayponds Village Hall Project.\nClayponds is a large housing\nestate in South Ealing that was bought by the college part-way\nthrough construction for use as\nstudent flats and houses. Fine so far. When completing the project,\nit would be fair to say that corners\nwere cut, and while they are generally pleasant enough, the majority\nof the dwellings were left without\nany communal space.\nNeither was there any social\nspace on the estate, so life at\nClayponds is, by admission of all\nwho live there, very dull.\nYears ago, some bright spark\nsuggested building a 'village hall'\nfor the estate - basically a function\nroom and bar for use by all the res-idents. General approval was received, plans drawn up, and costings calculated. At this point,\nsomething started to go wrong.\nWithout ever running into difficulties or receiving objection, the project floundered in college bureau-c racy. Given this history, we were very\npleased to hear from a union officer that the project has finally got\nthe go-ahead. Faced with the rare\nprospect of reporting some good news, we investigated.\nYes, a decision had been\nreached, but no-one really seemed\nto know what is was. Yes, the\ndesign office were drawing up\nplans, but they couldn't give us a start date. Yes, planning permission had to be obtained, but no,\nthere would not be any problems.\nSo why wasn't it happening?\nSomehow or other, this project\nhas been shoved into a maintenance category.

It's a homage. Although the characters are picked up fifteen years\nafter the original, and set off on a new mission, this is more of a remake than a sequel. And for that\nsimple reason, if you liked the orig-in al, you'll love Blues Brothers\n2000.\nThis time around it's Elwood\nwho is released from prison, and decides to put the band back\ntogether. Queue series of absurd\ncar chases, musical set-pieces, and cameos by every blues musician\nyou've ever heard of. Indeed, if\nanything there are far more musical\nnumbers in 2000 than there were\nin the original.\nOne of the principle reasons\nwhy this has the feel of a remake is\nthe number of original cast members who return. If they're not\ndead, then they're here. Thus,\nalthough the late John Belushi\n(Elwood's brother Jake in the orig i nal) is sadly absent, Frank Oz, Aretha Franklin, Kathleen Freeman\nand James Brown all return. The\nprinciple additions are therefore in\nthe form of the new Blues Brothers.\nJohn Goodman is Mighty Mack Blues, a bartender with a passion\nfor the blues, and a surprisingly\ngood singing voice. Morton is the\ncop on their tail, who ends up not necessarily twice as good.\nsinging in the band (don't ask how,\nit's all a bit contrived), and Bonifant\nis the obligatory annoying small\nchild.\nHowever, it's Aykroyd who' s left to carry the movie this time\naround, and thankfully, after a few\nlean years only highlighted by\nCrosse Pointe Blank, he's back on\nform. He sings and dances like it's still 1980, and quite simply, he is\nElwood Blues.\nBlues Brothers 2000 is a fans\ndream, and anyone else's night-mare. For example, the original was\nfamed for the biggest car-crashes\never filmed. This time round, Landis sets a new record, smashing\nsixty cars in a scene which goes on\nfor so long that it actually becomes\nboring. Similarly, for the fan the\nfinal battle of the bands contest is\nwondrous, as the Blues Brothers\nBand go head to head with the\nLouisiana Gator Boys (Eric Clapton,\nBB King, Bo Diddley, Dr John, Lou\nRawls....). For the uninitiated, how-ever, it could be two hours of tedium, particularly as there are very\nfew jokes for something which is\nostensibly a comedy,\nBlues Brothers 2000 is the original with a bigger budget. If you've\nseen the original, expect more of\nthe same. If you haven't, then how\ndare you call yourself a student?D Dave\nLIAR\nStarring: Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Michael Rooker, Renee Zellweger\nDirector: Josh &. Jonas Pate it ir ir it\nThis man will seriously screw with your head.\nAt present, the caption \" A film\nby Josh cx Jonas Pate\" probably doesn't mean anything to\nyou (it didn't to me until Is aw this\nfilm). Believe me, very soon it will.\nThe identical twins are Hollywood' s next big thing, with the same taut,\nnon-linear, style and reverence\ntoward American cinema that\nmarked out Tarantino's first two films. Indeed, Liar is so clearly the\nfilm we were all expecting Jackie\nBrown to be - a tight, character driven piece, which oozes directorial\nbrilliance whilst screwing with your\nmind.\nThe scenario is simple - as the\nprime suspect in the murder of\nprostitute Zellweger, rich-kid Roth\nis forced to undergo a lie detector\ntest by cops Penn and Rooker. Day after day they continue the treat-ment s, but Roth resolutely refuses\nto break down. Yet at the same time his captors become increasingly convinced of his guilt. Roth,\nhowever, starts to play games with\ntheir minds, and slowly he turns the\nfinger of suspicion onto his two tormentors.\nWhilst it may sound like formulaic schtick, it's actually a supremely shocking and surprising piece of\nnoir. Although it may become obvious who did it early on, there are\nstill many surprises to be had along\nthe way. Every character is morally\nambiguous, and every one is guilty\nof something. Roth is an alcoholic\nepileptic, giving one of his scariest\n(and best) performances to date,\nwhilst Penn is plagued by a gam bling addiction and bad debts.\nRooker is by far the most terrifying,\nhowever, as Roth slowly grinds\ndown his exterior, and finally forces\nhim onto the lie detector himself.\nFar more revealing than the\nperformances, however, is the skill\nof the directorial duo( who also\nwrote the film). They manage to\nmaintain a high tempo and credibility throughout Liar, despite almost\nthe entire film consisting of three\nmen locked in a small dark room.\nThe suggested twists and revelations of the storyline, together with\nsome brilliant set pieces - setting\nup the lie-detector and Roth's epileptic attacks in particular -combine to give a glimpse of a partnership who are on the verge of\ngreatness.\nWhilst the style and plotting are\nfirst rate, the dialogue is in need of\nsome work. Where Tarantino\nimbues his characters with personality through the script, the Pate\ntwins fall back on excellent performances from their leads.\nAlthough the style may not be\nentirely original, and the dialogue\nfalls short of the standards set by\nTarantino himself, this is a fine\nentry into the genre. Whilst the\ntwins may not become a great writing partnership, their future as a directorial force would seem assured. D Dave\n\n"

Ido not\nsmoke but do like a drink and so\nvisit pubs where smoking is an\nequally common pursuit. Ido not\nwish to see those who enjoy the\nright to smoke have their rights\ncurtailed by those who think they\nknow better so I accept that I must\ngo home smelling of stale tobacco.\nThere is currently much debate\nabout the number of people who would otherwise live longer if it\nwasn't for passive smoking. Since\nthe only evidence is statistical\nrather than clinical I think it is all a storm in a teacup and smokers\nshould be left alone to do what\nthey want in the privacy of their\nown home, after all we are all\nadults and free to make our own informed choices. The number of\nunproven deaths from passive\nsmoking in this country are about\nequal to the number of deaths due\nto medical negligence and mal-practice, about 2 0 , 0 0 0 per year. It\nmakes you wonder doesn't it?\nYours faithfully,\nNicholas Royall\nMaterials Dept\nBEWARE IMPOSTER\nDear Felix,\nYou may remember my column, 'The Idiot's Guide to\nGetting a First1\n, which appeared in\nthis esteemed journal last term.\nIndeed, if you read it, you are probably in the process of passing all\nyour exams with flying colours right\nnow.\nAnyway, as I was reading Felix\nlast week, I must say I was shocked\nand appalled by what I read in the\n'Electric Cafe'. I was just checking\nout the latest phat selection of acid\ngreenhouse choon s( or whatever\nthey call it these days), when I was\ndevastated by the discovery that\nsome impostor has nicked my pseudonym. In a blatant and cynical attempt to cash in on my success, a certain disc jockey, purportedly called Colin Dale, is releasing a new album. (OK, so he might have\nthought of it first and it might even\nbe his real name, but that's not\nthe point.) The album, 'Mutant:\nDisco', is being released on Harmless Records. I must inform\nthe readership that this is most\ndefinitely not a harmless record.\nBeing released at this time of year\nmeans that thousands of students\nwill rush out and buy it immediate-ly, thinking it to be packed full of\nuseful hints to get them through\ntheir exams, having associated it\nwith me. Instead, their concentration will be destroyed completely\nby a brain-damaging cacophony of\n'house and techno tracks' which\napparently have 'a disco influence'.\nMy reputation will be irreversibly\ndamaged and I will lose all the\ncredibility and respect I have built\nup over the years as a true pillar of\nthe College community. Do not\nbuy this album: the man is a dangerous and opportunistic fraud.\nYours sincerely,\nThe REAL Colin Dale\n(a.k.a James Clarke, Physics 3).\nFREE MUSIC\nDear Jeremy,\nI'd just like to take this opportunity to put in a blatant plug for\nthe Haldane Music library. It's part\nof the IC &. Science Museum Library, and any student can\nborrow CDs and cassettes from it.\nHowever, it quickly goes out of\ndate unless someone buys more\nmusic for it.

The leader of the world\nfourth-largest country took the\ndecision stand down yesterday\nmorning amid increasingly ugly\nscenes in the city and mounting\ninternational pressure. In his brief\nspeech, Suharto also acted to dissolve the current cabinet and immediately handed over power to\nhis vice-president, BJ Habibie.\nThe trouble began last Tuesday\nwhen around 5 0 0 0 students from a private college lead a demonstration to protest at delays in essential\nreforms. Towards the end of the\nday, a fight suddenly broke out and\nthe protesters were forced back\ninto the campus by the Riot Police.\nShots were then fired into the\nbuilding, killing six [Felix 1115].\nProtests immediately began across\nthe capital, with an estimated20,000 students occupying the\nparliament building.\nAs the army took control of\nmuch of Jakarta, looting and rioting\nbecome widespread, leaving over\n500 people dead. Worryingly, the\nChinese minority appeared to be a target for racially-motivated\nattacks, and most of Jakarta's Chinatown now lies in ruin.\nAmien Rais, the leader of an\nIndonesian Muslim organisation\nwith 28 million members, has\nemerged as the unofficial leader of\nthe opposition to the government.\nHe had planned a mass demonstration in Jakarta's Freedom Square on Wednesday, but cancelled after surveying the strength\nof the military presence in the area\nand ominous threats from army\ngenerals.\nAlthough Suharto's departure\nhas been warmly welcomed by pro-testers, the newly installed leader,\nBacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, is seen\nas 'more of the same' by many.\nOne of the few senior officials not\nto have a military background he is\nbehind many of Indonesia's economic and social reforms - not\nalways successfully. He is also a close personal friend of Suharto,\nand has been accused of 'crony-ism'.\nAimen Rais has given only conditional support to the new leader,\npressing for elections to be held as\nsoon as possible.\nSpoof Holiday Leads Media Astray\nED SEXTON\nA group of arts students who\nclaimed to have used sponsorship money to finance a holiday\nabroad have revealed that\nthe trip was a spoof.\nThe thirteen students, all\nthird years from Leeds\nUniversity, had collected\n\u00a3 1,800 from various sources\nto put on an exhibition called\n'Going Places'. On arriving at\nthe exhibition this week,\ntutors and critics were greeted with a bowl of Sangria and\nflamenco music, before\nbeing led to Leeds-Bradford\nairport, where they saw the\nstudents apparently arriving\non a plane from Spain. The students alleged that they had spent\nthe sponsorship on a holiday in the\nCosta del Sol, justifying the trip as a statement about the nature of art.\nTheir tutor, Terry Atkinson, defended the students in Tuesday's Guardian, describing the group as\n\"very bright\".\nOn Wednesday, however, the\ngroup revealed that the entire trip\nhad been fabricated, and claimed\nOne of the pic tue s used to dupe newspapers;\nactually taken in Scarborough\nthat the media attention and emo tion that had been generated was a work of art. In The Independent\nTerry Atkinson saw the affair as\n\"very successful in raising questions\nabout the nature of art.\" The students have promised to repay the\nsponsorship money, but this has\nnot pacified Leeds Student Union,\nwho gave the group a grant of over\n\u00a3 1 , 0 0 0 . Speaking to Felix Ruth\nWilkin, Communications Officer for\nLeeds Student Union,\nexpressed her displeasure\nat the incident, commenting that the students\ninvolved would be asked\n\"to explain themselves\"\nnext week. She added that\nthe Union would \"probably\nbe taking further action\".\nAlthough the students have\npromised to return money\nto all sponsors, Ms Wilkin\nmentioned that many\ngroups were \"really un hap py\" with the situation. The\nspoof was not part of the students'\ncourse, but a voluntary exhibition\noften put on (or not, in this case) at\nthis time of year by third year\nartists.\nThe\nShrinking\nNewspaper\nat Imperial\nCollege\nIssue111622 May1998 "

Considering the gravity of\nissues dealt with, we couldn't help\nfeeling that perhaps the mood was\nat times slightly too upbeat, but as\na whole, the play portrayed typically depressing topics in a sensitive\nmanner and managed to include a hefty serving of feelgood factor.\nThe suffering of the characters was\nskimmed over perhaps a little\nwhich admittedly made for good entertainment, although not an in-depth reflection on contemporary\nsociety. But who wants that from a musical anyway? Rent has just the\nright balance - it put us in the picture without dwelling on and\nexploiting the problems of the\ncharacters.\nThe cast was excellent with\nvery powerful and enigmatic performances from all, especially Mimi( a nightclub dancer) and Angel (a gay transvestite - very PC). (No,\nvery Candy Darling - Trainspotter\nArts Ed). Everyone in the Company was obviously enjoying themselves\nand putting a great deal of effort\nand energy into the singing and\ndancing. This came across strongly\nand enabled us to easily emp a this e with the characters, which were all\nwell-defined. They portrayed the\nhumorous and witty scenes very\ncleverly, especially in the tele-phone/an s a phone sessions with\nthe outside world. These scenes\nhelped to put the play into context\nand emphasised its true ness to life.\nThe costumes were also of a very high standard - you could\nimagine seeing people wearing\nthem in the streets, yet they were\nnot boring or dull and had a striking\nimpact that accompanies the 'any-thing goes' attitude in New York.\nThe whole virtue of Rent, in fact, is\nthat it is a genuinely streetwise and\nbelievable musical that lacks pretentiousness and, quite frankly,\ncorn.\nJudith and Christian\nY ou've seen the film, you've\nbought at least one of the\nCD's, some of the poster collection and you've probably even\ngot the t shirt. Have you read the\nbook, or seen the play? Why not?\n\"Because its probably a bunch of\narty shirt-lifter s over-pronouncing\nsome unheard-of geezers' rambling adaptation\". Until last Friday\nnight I'd have probably agreed: I 've\nseen Shakespeare in the Theatre\nand on the silver screen and its\nbetter on the screen - if he'd been\nalive today the Bard would have\nbeen a screenwriter. Mind you if\nhe was alive today, he might well\nbe Irvine Welsh and Harry Gibson\nrather than the Coen brothers.\nThere is very little theatre which\nis worth seeing these days, but that\nwhich is, really is worth seeing.\nTrainspotting (the Play) is one of\nthose which, like Ben Elton's Popcorn, comes to life on the stage\n- especially one as small as the\nMan in the Moon, Chelsea (just\n'round the corner from Vivienne's, darling!). It's a moody, violent,\nfrightening beast, with the tortured\nsoul of the disenchanted, gobbing\nand knifing its way through the\naudience, whirling a Snooker cue\nand shouting at you. Go and see it\n- let down your defences and actually allow something to affect you, for once. Wonder at how they\nmanage to actually shoot up on\nstage, three feet from you. Feel\nwhat it would be like to be the lowest person in the world, slowly\nkilling yourself on junk. Ask yourself\nwhether suicide, wouldn't surely be\nbetter than the ups and downs of a smack habit. There's no overall\npolitical comment yet the politics\nis startling in its crude truthfulness.\nIt's not about Generation X, or\neven chemical culture, it's about\nthose who don't even care what\nsociety is - as Renton himself\nadmits; \"Due tae this failure tae\nrecognise societal reward, success\n(and failure) can only ever be fleeting experiences for me their\nvalue can never be sustained\nbecause there's nae recognition ay\nthe society which values\nthem ah d in nae gie a fuck.\"\nIn the film, we're allowed to\nhope that things work out all right\nfor Renton at least. In the book,\nwe suspect that he's going to do it\nall again, just in a different country,\nbut at least he gets a chance. In the\nplay, we're given no such luxury -Renton is as bad as Begbie, as he\nsurely must have been all along.\nHe just destroys himself with heroin rather than in psychotic heroism.\nAt least the Beggar is delusional -at least he has a reason to hate the\nworld. The Rent Boy just cannot be\nbothered - life's done him no\nfavours, so he's not even going to\ntry - take what's coming and hunt\nfor the next hit. The only small\nproblem 1 have with Gibson's adaptation was its omission of one of\nthe best lines from the book; 'You\njust want tae fuck up on drugs so\nthat everyone'll think how deep and\nfucking complex you are. It's pathetic and fucking boring.\" We probably all know someone like\nthis, and the deepest irony is that\nthey tend to be the ones who rave\nabout the film the most.\nStephen Starkie\nT his is the long-awaited adaptation of Puccini's classic, La\nBoheme. Taking the underbelly of 1800s Paris and translating\nit to the fin de siecle New York, was\nthe life's work of one man, Jonathan Larson. This musical has\ntaken Broadway by storm, with\nmany members of the audience\ngoing back time and again. With its\nstudent friendly price-tag, \u00a3 10, and\nits extremely cool and streetwise\nlook, this musical embodies the\nsoul of New York, of the people\nLou Reed sang about in Walk on\nthe Wild Side. You'll find Candy\nDarling, Sugar Plum Fairy and Holly, who came from Miami FLA\nand hitch-hiked her way across the\nUSA, renamed, but recognisable.\nAnother influence is obviously\nStephen Sondheim (he helped with\nthe drafts) and the musical is remi-ne scent of West Side Story, without ever being derivative. Another\nfamiliar face is the girl from the\nTamperer song, Krysten Ma rquez, she's playing Mimi Ma rquez, and\nanyone who listens to the radio will\nknow that she has an amazingly\npowerful voice.\nThis musical has broken all the\nrecords in America. The audience\nsizes have been unprecedented,\nand approval in New York has been\nalmost universal. This is a show for\nyoung people, and as such it has\nbeen extremely successful in luring\npeople who normally wouldn't have gone to Broadway - they\nhaven't had an empty seat in two\nyears. Perhaps this musical won't do as well in this country, where we\nare more familiar with the seedy\nside of life through plays such as\nCleansed and Shopping and\nFucking, films such as\nTrainspotting, and TV programmes\nsuch as This Life. 1 can only hope it\nwill, because apart from Chicago, it\nis the best musical to come off\nBroadway since Guys and Dolls.\nIt should be noted that\nJonathan Larson succumbed to\nAIDS, literally days before the show\nopened in 1996. In performing this\nmonument to his life, we are preserving his memory, and making\nhim immortal. A little hyperbole\nnever hurt anyone.\nJulia H "

    "content": "22 May 1998 NEWS\nMicrosoft in the Dock\nMARK BAKER\nMicrosoft, the world's most successful software company, faces a new threat this week.\nThe US Department of Justice (DO)) and twenty US states have filed a lawsuit against Bill\nGates' all-powerful company.\nMicrosoft is charged with engaging in anti-competitive and exclusion ary practices designed\nto maintain its monopoly in personal computer\noperating systems and to extend that monopoly\nto Internet browsing software. Essentially, the\nDOJ is seeking to stop Microsoft from integrating\nInternet Explorer (its Internet browser) into\nWindows 98, a minor upgrade to its all-per v ad ing PC operating system. It argues that users are\nunlikely to install a different browser, and this\nwould effectively ensure Microsoft's domination\nof the Internet browser market, as almost all PCs\nrun a version of Windows. \"This action will protect innovation by ensuring that anyone who develops a software program will have a fair\nopportunity to compete in the marketplace,\"\nsaid Joel Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in\ncharge of the DOJ's Antitrust Division.\nSupport for the lawsuit has come from an\nunlikely source - President Bill Clinton, speaking\non Tuesday after meeting EU leaders, said: \"This\nis not just an open-and-shut case where one\nparty sues somebody else ... This is something\nthat will have a significant impact on our eco no my.\" The Clinton administration is keen to see\ncompetition flourish as the growth of the\nInternet creates a vast new market. More than\n100 million people are now connected to the\nNet with the figure expected to increase to a billion by 2005. E business is expected to grow\nnearly a hundredfold over a five-year period and\ntraffic over the Internet is now said to be doubling every 100 days.\nBill Gates learns the strength of his\ndetractors' feelings as a conference last year.\nIn a typically hostile and bullish response,\nMicrosoft hit back at their accusers, stating that\nthe lawsuits \"are without merit and could set a harmful precedent in which government intervention in a healthy, competitive and innovative\nindustry would adversely affect consumers and\nthe ability of U.S. companies to continually\nimprove their products.\" In an open letter to cus-to mers, Bill Gates said that the requested\nchanges to Windows98 \"appear to benefit a single competitor at the expense of consumers\".\nMicrosoft also stated that the release of\nWindows98 was \"on schedule\" to reach consumers on June 25.\nHowever, most industry observers remain\nunconvinced of Microsoft's lofty principles - in\nMarch1997 an internal memo concluded \"if we take away IE from the O/S, most nav users will\nnever switch to us.\"\nShould Microsoft lose the case, the US government could break up the 'super company' or\nregulate its business practices. Given the importance of Microsoft in the US economy( it\nemploys nearly 25,000 staff), the latter option is\nmore likely. Microsoft would most likely be\nforced to include less \"free\" software with its\noperating system, instead selling the packages\nindividually. It would also have to put a stop to\nits practice of press u rising PC manufacturers to\ninclude Windows and Internet Explorer on every\nmachine sold. (When Compaq decided to bundle Netscape Navigator, Microsoft threatened to\nrescind Compaq's license to install Windows on its desktop PCs).\nAs news of the titanic legal battle was\nreleased, shares in Microsoft have dropped from\n$89 to $86. Bill Gates won't be losing sleep yet\nthough - at this price his company is still worth\nover $200 billion.\nNew from CCS SHOP...

In their absence\nthey have been hailed as the originators of a sound lifted wholesale\nby Garbage and Sneaker Pimps, a comparison that is trotted out in\nEVERY SINGLE REVIEW of work by\neither band (see how easy it is to\nfall into the clich e trap, Norman. Must do better...). The trouble with\ncanon ising dead heroes in this\nmanner is that when they are reanimated, the corrupted, flesh hanging from their shambling frames,\nthey never seem quite as attractive\nas you remember. Sure, their defining characteristics are still there -the goth-hop industrialism, Toni\nHalliday' s frosty come-ons - but\nWHERE ARE THE GODDAMN TUNES? It's as though half the\nalbum has been remixed to afford\nthe surgical removal of any melody\nwhatsoever. When taken to its logical extreme by the likes of\nWitchman (a sometime col labor a tor), this abrasive de flowering may\nhave some merit, but the slick production renders tracks like Dirty\nHigh too anaemic to have any real\nimpact. In their quieter moments\n(Cotton Candy, Beyond Reach), the\ngaze is drawn shoe-ward, the trip\nstumbles rather than hops (thanks\nto Tim Simenon), and it just allows\nus to hear some truly awful lyrics.\nRemember Chinese Burn, used on\nthe Sony Minidisc campaign?\nApparently \"It cuts her up like Irish\nmortar / Mother's Pride is what we taught her\". Er, right.\nRecovery is a glimpse of old\nglories, powerful riff whipped into\nshape by blue steel distortion. And as the dry ice begins to creep from\nmy stereo, Something Familiar\nturns out to be just that, a passable\nrehash of Frozen. But a rehash\nnonetheless, and it's just not\nenough to rescue an album that\nwould've just about made a good EP. My advice is to seek out the\nPubic Fruit collection of EPs, and\nreturn Come Clean to it's rightful\nplace - the grave. El\nNorm\nCATHERINE WHEEL THE PECADILOES\nAdam And Eve * *\nF or any of you who think that\nthis is Catherine Wheel's debut album, I can understand why you continue to believe\nthis misconception. They have\nreturned once again with their fifth\nalbum and we must ask ourselves,\nwhat happened to the last four?\nIt appears that the band have\nbeen touring constantly since their\ndebut, in the effort of trying to\ndrum up some kind of fan bass, 1\nalmost had the pleasure of seeing\nthem myself, when supporting the\nBluetones in '96, but thankfully I got Geneva instead, a band who comparatively have come a long\nway since then. I then found out\nthat they have also supported Bush\nthroughout America and one can\nonly ponder how they managed\nsuch a thing.\nThroughout this touring, something in the band has changed.\nOnce a band very dark in its sound\nand reasonably heavy, it seems\nthey may have been affected by the\nsuccess of indie, as the new album\nis much lighter, almost to the\nextent that they resemble an early\nDel Amitri, but lacking the singer or\nthe tunes. Trying to conceive that\nthis band could squeeze a single\nfrom this LP is hard, as no song\neven catches your attention and\nthe words' meanings are so vague,\nperhaps in an attempt to be deep\nor humourous.\nIt's always a shame to see any\nband transform their sound, purely\nfor the sake of popularity. It rarely\nworks, but for Catherine Wheel it\nhas resulted in even worse. At least\nwhen they were playing their type\nof music, it was bad music that you\nin some ways had to respect them\nfor, but now it's just bad music in\nan attempt to tap into the indie\nsounds of the moment. 1\n3\n1\nDavid H. Caught On Venus * * *\nT he first thing to notice about\nthe Pecadiloes is their rubbish\nname and how gay they look\non the inner sleeve. Out of interest\nI looked up pec ad ilo in the dictionary and discovered that not only\nwas it spelt with a double T but\nthat it meant a 'trivial offense'. It\nwas therefore a great disappointment to find that this album is not\ncrap because it would have made\nfor a very easy review.\nThe music is quite nice in an\ninoffensive kind of way. At first listen it would be easy to write this lot\noff as dull indie almost ran s but listen again and you are rewarded\nwith a variety of interesting effects\nand sounds that you didn't notice\nthe first time. There is a definite\npunk feel to the album; harsh whispered and screaming vocals. But it\nis also very funky with plenty of\nthick bass underlying each track.\nStand out tracks include the\nWanting Song and Deep Reversal\nwhich both provide plenty of the\nabove.\nThe biggest problem with the\nalbum is that the songs are all far\ntoo similar (with the exception of\nKirsten's Beach which comes over\nall calypso). All too often 1 was\nchecking my CD player thinking I was still listening to one track only\nto find that we had in fact moved\non. Still, if you like what you hear,\nwhich 1 did, then this is not too\ngreat a crime. If you have all the\ngood releases from the last few\nweeks or so and still have a spare\nthirteen quid lying around you could do a lot worse than this. El\nAlex\nTha Bomb!\nTha Bomb will be back next week\nwith the chief himself, Milen. He'll\nhave the low down on the past,\ncurrent and future r'n' b/ hip hop\nhappenings coming your way.\n\n"

The basic reason for this\nis that I have a piece of laboratory\nwork outstanding. I will not go into\nthe whys and wherefores of the situation now( but if Dr. Payne is\nreading, it involves a week of illness\nplus my grandmother back home not being very well. Honestly).\nThinking about this has made\nme wonder whether the summer is\nin fact a good time to do any work\nat all. Furthermore, the neanderthals who, presumably back in\nthe Stone Age, decided, \"Hey! I 've\ngot a swell idea! Let's set all exams\nin the summer! Country-wide!\" are\nnever likely to have been MENSA candidates. In fact, they are likely\nto have been amongst the most\nbrainless cretins that concatenation\nof DNA has ever produced. Only\nonce previously (as far as I can remember), in the case of a certain\nMr. Adolf Hitler, has so much power been erroneously awarded\nto such a gibbering bunch of thoroughly mad and really quite criminally sadistic maniacs.\nDoing my lab work at this time\nlast year was a period of my life\nwhich Iam not terribly likely to consider with any retrospective joy.\nThe misery of sitting around baking\nhot soldering apparatus while the\nsun inexorably increased the room temperature was, bluntly, a little\nover the top. Many students found\nthemselves sneaking out of the\nsweltering building, not to visit the\ndrinks machine downstairs, but\ninstead to stagger across campus\ntowards Chemistry in the hope of a nice refreshing glass of liquid nitrogen and some dry ice biscuits. This\nleft me behind, eyes aching, staring\npointlessly at the hallucinogenic\ngreen oscilloscope screen and attempting to fix the vertical hold\nfor the umpteenth time, while, to\nmy left, my experiment slowly\noverheated, grinned maliciously at\nme, and exploded. I can still see\nLissajou's figures in my nightmares\nto this day.\nWhether the following is\nbacked by statistical evidence I know not, but Iam a firm believer\nthat all the worst illness crops up in\nthe summer. With temperatures\nrising, personal hygiene decreasing,\nand lots of lovely rotting food about, the bacteria and viruses all\ncome out to play, like the annoying\nkids at the front of our house on a Saturday. Add to this the problem\nof all the lovely pollen floating\naround, and hey presto! A recipe\nfor disaster is conceived.\nExam halls are one of two things: either a) cold enough to\nfreeze your hands to the desk if you are foolish enough to touch it or b) hot enough to melt your ruler so\nthat it resembles one of those\nWham chewy bars. This can lead to\nthe further problem that if you absent-mindedly drop your pen into this molten mass of straightedge it will sink in and remain there\nforever, a monument to the stupidity of administration. Not only this,\nbut the aforementioned medical\nmiseries are enough to put all but\nthe most career-minded people off\ntheir work, the remainder becoming all poetic and swapping their\nblue shift theory and knowledge of\ncloud chambers for blue sky theory,\nfilled with clouds of its own. Others\nsimply become violently ill, and I would not have liked to have been\nthe marker for the GCSE paper on which a friend of mine violently and\nrepeatedly threw up.\nExams in the summer?
