    "content": "RAG ARTICLE This is just a quick word to remind you\nthat Rag is still alive. In fact, if you\nthought it all stopped dead after Rag\nWeek, then you'd better think again as\nwe've got plenty of goodies lined up for\nyou this term.\nFirstly (as always) there are the C CU collections, which I'm sure you'll hear\nabout from them, including the Inter C CU Monopoly stunt in early February. Also\nwe'll be having more Rag Mag trips, so\nkeep your ears and eyes open for news of\nthose.\nThe main event though, is to be held\njointly with the National Deaf Children's Society, and as they have just elected a new Scottish chairman, we're having a Sponsored C aber Tossing in Princes Gardens on Saturday 8th March. Deaf\nchildren from local schools will be com in q to toss their (foam rubber) cab ers, and\nwe'll be presenting two of these schools\nwith a radio-hearing aid bou qh t from the\nproceeds of the Rag Procession. So, if you\nwant to play silly games, wear a kilt, or\njust join the kids for their jelly and ice\ncream, keep watching this space, or come\nto the next Rag Committee Meeting, which is on Wednesday 30th January at\n7:00pm in the I CW A Lounge. By the way,\nthe Summer Fete is to be on 3rd May this\nyear, so get thinking about those stalls\nand sideshows.\nThe only other event this term is to be\nanother Rag Disco in the last week of\nterm. Talking of discos, the Toga Party\nwas quite successful, and although disappointed at the turnout, I was pleased\nto see that those who did come joined in\nwith the spirit of the occasion and actually wore togas (of all shapes, sizes,\nstyles and colours).\nAnyway, thanks to all those who helped, especially Brian, Jamie and Jo for\nthe decorations, Gary and David for the\ndoor and bar-ticket selling, Andy, Nick\nWat m ough, Nick Childe Harmer and friend for doing the bar, and Barney and\nPhil for helping on Sunday as well. Also\nthanks to the crowd who did door-work\nor cleaned up, namely Kirsten and Jan, Tansy and Mo, Katy, Marco, Rich, Sean,\nPat, Ruth and Gareth and anyone else\nI 've either forgotten or don't know the\nname of.\nRemember, everyone's welcome at\ncommittee meetings, and we need your.\nideas. r>, Bye for now,\nRa e.UG M REPORT Well folks, yet another U GM has\npassed, attended once again by the FF( faithful few) or should that be S CFF( slightly confused faithful few)?\nThe reports were accepted with hardly\na complaint, so Hall residents may find\nthemselves making their own beds and\ncleaning their rooms in the near future\nand hence produce a26% reduction in\nstaff labour costs. Ted Heath is likely to\nreceive a petition against increases in\noverseas students fees after Mr Fox noted the rumours that Mr Heath might\nbe leading a back bench revolt. Soon\navailable will be A Guide On How To\nLobby Your MP by Mr Fox. John Murphy was elected as ordinary\nmember of the Permanent Working Party\nafter Philip Cole's speech was judged as a try for a sympathy vote, (\"I know John, he's a nice chap, he lives next door to\nme, but . . . \").\nThe bylaw changes proposed by Mr Stotesbury, were passed before some had\nworked out the slightly complex ordering\nof Exec News and extras and hence\nfound out what the changes were. The\never alert Mr Brain, however, drew to our\nattention the fact that the proposed Standing Orders changes would put a set\ntime limit on speeches and extensions,\nthus preventing the full explanation of\ncomplicated motions. Needless to say the\nchanges were defeated.\nOn to the motions. MrS totes bury seemed to have had a field day trying to\noutlaw unequal/unfair media coverage for\nelection candidates. The fact that the\nredraft was presented in such a manner\nthat when coupled with the motion in Exec\nNews it became rather contusing, to say\nthe least, plus no opposition speech and\nthe usual touch of apathy, enabled the\nmotion to be passed and pass by us.\nICU seems to have been a bit behind\nthe times, but at last it has adopted the\nUN Universal Declaration On Human Rights(1948) together with notes on Russian intervention in Afghanistan and\nApartheid as proposed by Tim Hillyer.\nMoved from sixth place to third, Ms Pratt's motion noted that nuclear waste is\nbeing transported through London on\nthree nights per week in containers which\nhave only been tested in 30mph crash\nconditions (when they share tracks with\nlOOm ph trains) and three containers have\nalready been derailed and some withdrawn\nas unsafe. It also noted that it was\nrerouted at one time but due to extra\ncost is now once again passing through\nLondon .\nThe motion was passed and so the ICU banner will be attending the demonstration\n(1:00pm on Saturday 26th January at\nPrimrose Hill \u2014 Chalk Farm underground)\nagainst the use of the London route.\nThe motion on student grants (proposed\nby Bernard Smith) seemed straightforward\nenough, but what is this in ICU believes\n(2) \"That students in metropolitan cities\nare in considerable financial hardship\ncompared to students in campus universities\"( my stressing), you-must-be-joking\ntime: as Ms Armitage pointed out in her\nopposing speech the only hardship is due\nto non-payment of parental contributions\n(ie the means test granted). On voting, a second count had to be taken, the motion\nbeing defeated by just seven votes.\nThe motion on Apartheid will now be\nread at the next U GM( Tuesday 5th February), which just happens to clash\nwith Mines U GM... Chapter7: Mary's Cycling Tour Of Yorkshire Today you have the rare and dubious\npleasure of experiencing one of r ny shorter\nbut more exhilarating contributions to this\nmag. It gives me great pleasure and a deep\nsense of satisfaction to give to you plucky few\nwho are still with me the knowledge that this\nisn't really a continuation of the Sexploits Of\nMary Millington as featured in one of the\nglossy mags that are always to high on the\nshelves, but a dreary discourse on another of\nthose bor i ng topics that seem to permeate the\nvery being of us ardent article all iterators.

OR A SONG FOR THE ENGINEERS\nRemember this?\n\"Your Honorary Craduands are\nof an age where their contribution to\nthe,.material progress of society\nthrough technology is mainly of the\npast. \"\\ a contentious statement from\nSir Monty Finniston when he made\nhis address to IC for Commemoration Day last term. At that time\nthe eponymous Finniston committee\nwas completing its report on the\nstate of the engineering profession\nof today, a weighty project of some\ntwo-and-a half years in its execution.\nThe result is a somewhat pessimistic\nview of the plight of the engineer. The\nreport also investigates the lack of\nappreciation of engineering skills and\nthe lack of technical comprehension\nin the higher strata of management,\nbut although it accurately identifies\nthe problems, the answers are not so\nforthcoming.\nThe underlying idea (which is a sound one) is the integration of\nbusiness and engineering, as well as\nthe supplementing of education in\nengineering as a step in the formation\nof a new public image for the\nengineer. In line with this the\nFinniston committee also sings the\npraises of setting up an Engineering\nAuthority as a bulwark against the\ncollages of Britain in manufacturing\nindustry and includes the suggestion\nthat material incentive should be\noffered to prospective engineers; at\nuniversity level, a bursar y, in addition\nto scholarships or the usual grants.\nEmphasis is laid on more practical\nwork and the introduction of more\nwomen to engineering. A proposed\ncure for one cause of anxiety, the\nstandard of British engineering\ndegrees relative to European ones, is\nthe adoption of a new three-tier\ndegree system, in contrast with the\npresent system.\nAll of this invites com parisi on with\nthe system at IC. The Total Technology course has produced its\nfirst graduates, sharing the same\naims as the Finniston committee.\nAmong the three- constituent colleges, City and Guilds is unique in\nhaving their Engineering Board, interposed between departmental\ncommittees and the Central Board of\nStudies. The object of the Engineering Board is to unify the departments\nand lead to faster, more convenient\ndealings with the Board of Studies.\nFamily resemblance between departments plays a large part in its\nsuccessful operation; at this level it\nappears practicable, but can it work\non a larger scale? Regrettably, the\nEngineering Authority may turn out\nto be yet another institution,\nun adventurous and of little deter-mi nation. Making notes and asking questions is simple; providing answers,\nthe right answers, is not. It seems\nironic that Sir Monty Finniston\nshould have ended his address by\noffering his congratulations to\ngraduates whose degrees, by virtue\nof his proposals, might soon be out of\ndate.\nLars Wernberg-Meller\n(Quotation from FELIX Issue no.\n531)\n2\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT FOOTBALL\nIC 1st XI vs RF H1st XI: 3-2\nSteve V eats made a triumphant return as goalkeeper in the 1st XI on\nSaturday. My regular reader (!) will\nrecall that last time ' Hands' Veats\nplayed, the team won 5-4 with Veats\ngetting a hat trick . . . for QM C! In this\ngame, however, Steve caught everything, and the rest of the team were\nso surprised that, against their better\ninstinct they won the game!\nIC's confidence grew in the opening\nstages as Veats saved a few useful shots.\nSo much so that a 'Mis Hit' Rickard\ncorner was controlled by Dave Dean,\nwhose amazing (for a man of his stature)\nturn so astounded the opposition that he\nwas able to volley IC into a well deserved\nlead without them hardly realizing it!\nThe match was keenly, and cleanly\ncontested throughout. However, the\nreferee was forced to book aRF H player\nwho expressed strong opinions when he\ndidn't get a free kick after Hendy's late\ntackle! Hendy, who had been left out of\nhis cage minutes before kick off, was\nsoon in the book after another late\ntackle. Unfortunately, RF H were allowed\nto equalise just before halftime, following mass brain seizure in the IC\ndefence.\nAt half-time, we fed Hendy some raw\nmeat and decided on new tactics. We\nwould start passing to each other\ninstead of to RF H who refused to give\nthe ball back! These tactics brought\ninstant success as Stevenson blasted\nthe ball home after a goal mouth\nscramble. Encouraged by being ahead\nagain, IC took control and only Rowley's in sistance on missing the goal and\nRickard's in sistance on passing to their\nkeeper kept the score at 2-1. Then ten\nminutes from the end, RF H got a crippling equalise r. However, the 1st Xl's new found spirit\nrefused to be denied. The result was\nsealed in the closing minutes when\nRickard's pass to RFH's keeper went\nastray and finished up in the goal! The\n1st XI were relieved and delighted to win\nand credit must go to all for the spirit\nshown throughout the game.\nFinally, it is sadly noted that the Steve\nVeats Appreciation Society is in danger\nof being disbanded unless its herd\nthrows some more shots into the net!\nTeam: S Veats, J Gamble, M Curran, K Reeve, C Beer, C Hendy, I Stevenson, A Donaldson, D Dean, J Rowley and G Rickard.\nChris Hendy's Keeper and Cage Cleaner\nA2nd XI IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nFOOTBALL REPORT\nOn a clear cold Wednesday afternoon,\nthe 2nd team took to the football field to\nhandsomely defeat an L SE2nd XI team\nby four goals to one.\nThe initial well organised LSE side was\noverrun gradually by the IC midfield of\nKev Buckley, Phil Niccolls and Brian\nScannell. Clinical finishing by the IC\nforwards of whom Dave McPhail, driving\nthe ball low on each occasion, scored two\ngoals and Dick Veenman, a low drive and\na volley off a one-two from Phil's mouth,\nalso scoring two goals consolidated our\nposition at half-time to 4-0.\nIn the second half LSE applied pressure which was relieved chronically\nby sturdy left wing play from Aled\nPhillips. However, solid IC defence by\nDec McGukin and Giles Brereton and\nKenny Sansom-like defensive thrusts\nfrom the flanks by Chris Hendy and Jim\nBeer foiled all the LSE attacks. The game\nfinished at 4-1 win for IC 2nds after LSE scored scored a consolation goal towards\nthe end of the game.\nBefore IC returned to College they\ndutifully rearranged British Rail Southern\nregion scheduled service by posing as\nmanagement staff and holding up the\ntrain while Ken Buckley relieved himself,\nthe operation was controlled by the\nauthoritative voice of Giles Brereton\nbacked by subtle shouts from Phil\nNiccolls of \"hurry up Kev, you s... heap.\"\nTeam: A Betts, C Hendy, D McGukin,\nG* Brereton, J Beer, K Buckley, P Niccolls, B Scannell, D McPhail, D Veenman and A Phillips.\nBrian Scannell\n2nds vs Kings: 3\u20141\n2nds Survive Psychological Attack\nKings 2 decided that the only way to\nbeat IC was to make us over confident\nand when only nine Kings players\narrived at Beit Arch on Saturday, the talk\nturned to scores of 10\u20140, but at\nHariington the Kings plan became clear\nas there were the two 'mining' players\nand a substitute. IC morale was at a low\nebb especially as the side included the\nnewcomers, the hamstring trouble Merrit, some chap called Price and the\ntotally incompatible Knowles, whose\npre-match talk of the application of\nDeep heat to the male organs was\nclassic.\nThe 2nds soon settled and soon\nnoticed the poor offside trap employed\nby Kings. Many time lone centre forward\nM cP hail showed the finishing that\nmakes him a natural winger. He did\nhowever shoot one past a hee per left\nunprotected by a trap that failed 1-0.\nIC dominated a superb ball from\n'Cyrille' Knowles over an advancing\ndefence allowed Niccolls to put the ball\nin with his usual style. 2-0. Kings\nobtained a penalty and Betts saved to\nheep the score at 2-0 until half-time.\nIn the second half, IC swarmed over\nKings and from a poor clearance to the\nedge of the box, Kevin Buckley, the\nLaughing Cavalier of the team drove\nhome to make the score 3-0.\nBut it was now the constant nagging\nof McG uck in unsettled the team and\nKings bounded the ball in after a low\nhard cross eluded the bickering Celt.\n3-1. Buckley's humour calmed the team\ndown and for the last five minutes they\nswamped the opposition, but with no\nfurther addition to the score, the game\nended with a score of 3-1 taking the 2nds XI goal tally to 49 for the season.\nThe Beau Brummie\nIC BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER\nCLUB\nThe C team travelled all the way to\nRH C and when we got there, we\nfought our way through the hordes of\nadmiring amazons and Dave Nuttall\nwon yet another match to brilliant\nstorm bringing applause. Alexander Cameron played next and fought off\nwaves of sheer misery to actually win\nhis first game.\nI played next amidst scenes of\nhysterical admiration at my new hair\ncut and came out on top (not my\nhair). Next came the Kelly contribution. \u2022\nHaving had all my previous comments\nabout this chap censored and edited, I shall just say that if this is the best\nIreland can bring up on potatoes, it's about time they had a famine \u2014 he\nlost.\nFinally, the great (all hail) Graham\nCurtis played last against a chap looking like an Afghan terri or( or is it\nterrorist?) who, like a scene straight\nfrom Life Of Brian should have been\nhappy to get away with crucifixion.\nSo, we won 4-1 altogether (so the C team are miles above the B team).\nThe B team played LSE at home and\nwon 3-2 after being 2-0 down.\nOn Wednesday last, the A team\nentertained LSE B team at home. They\ncemented their opponents 4-1. This\nwas not good enough thanks to a sickening defeat of Shaun Armstrong\nwho was preoccupied with matters of\ngetting Edward Kennedy into IRA Soc.\nAll the others won and the role of\nstars is as follows( in order of\nimportance to the world): Martin Proudlove, feeling a bit white, hammered his opponent (I bet he wishes\nhe could 'reproduce' his form else-where); Geoffrey Keymer, who has in\nthe past sold his body to win snooker\nmatches (especially doubles, eh Alex!)\nhad no trouble beating his talent less partner (I mean all good snooker players do physics not economics); Sir\nSan Teelock an understanding and\nwhimpering mercenary from the lost\ncountry of Malicious, took on a huge\nchange of form to actually, if feebly,\nwin a match (cor you'll deserve them\nblues); last was the lone Tripp,a snooker player of little importance and\nlarge expend ability \u2014 he has his days\noccasionally, but as a snooker player,\nI don't see much hope for him. He\nwon however, with the traumatic commitment of a cleans haven Ayatollah. HOCKEY IC LADIES vs UC:2 \u20141\nOn Wednesday 16th January, IC\nLadies played a match, rearranged from\nlast term. It was supposed to be at UC's ground, but due to frozen pitches, it was\nplayed out at Hariington.\nOwing to a slight error by Fay Hood\n(ie forgetting the shirts) IC Ladies took\nthe field in spare Guilds Rugby shirts. It\nwas in fact a calculated error, because\nthese shirts turned out to be much\nwarmer than ours (well, that's my story\nand I'm sticking to it!).\n15\n\n"

JUST A SEC(RETARY)\nIf this article was a forum for my personal\nviews it would have a resoundingly depressive\nair to it this week. For as a sabbatical I have a good idea of what the potential of this Union\ncould be. I am convinced we have the potential\nto achieve alot more for the wellbeing of us all.\nCollege life, including the course content and\npresentation, is by no means perfect and it\ncould just be that if you cared and took the\ninitiative things might be changed.\nYOUR VIEW\nOK so many of you read the last Exec News\nand thought \"what a bore!\" or \"how does that\naffect me\". If that's the case you have only\nyourself to blame. If you want to see a motion\non refectories, accommodation, the social life,\nyour course, etc, why not put it in yourself.\nThe deadline for motions for the next\nUGM is Tuesday 29th January. They\nshould be handed or myself in the ICU\nOffice.\nBIG CONFERENCE\nThis Union is proud that it will be staging the\nmost important annual conference of students\nof science and technology in Europe. For a week during Easter 1981, we will be hosts to\none hundred students. It is not only an\noccasion to discuss common matters relevant\nto our education or careers, visit industry,\nsight see, but also the chance to get to know\nmany new friends.\nAt a meeting this Thursday 31st January\nI would like to see thirty first or second years\nwho would like to be involved in the week. The\nmeeting is in the S CR and starts at 1:00pm. DUREX MACHINE AND RECIPR O CAL ARRANGEMENTS\nFollowing my piece two weeks ago two\npoints: Girls, there is a machine, of course, in\nthe ladies toilet in the Union Building, but not\none in Southside (hopefully there will be soon).\nAlso, thanks to those who have been giving me\ninfo concerning our reciprocal arrangements. I will reply to you on the outcome of my\ninvestigations.\nNUCLEAR WASTE\nI was pleased to see at the U GMa motion\npresented on an environmental issue (the\ntransport of nuclear waste through London). It\nwas decided that the ICU banner should go on\na protest march rf i is Saturday. I must\napplaud the individual who whilst saying he\nwas in favour of nukes also said that we must\neradicate the unnecessary safety risks involved.\nIf you feel the same way join me at Beit Arch\non Saturday at 11:00.\nADVENTURE PLAYGROUND\nOne event of last term's Environmental\nWeek was of a practical nature. We visited an\nadventure playground in Hackney to begin the\njob of rebuilding it.\nSince then ICU has adopted it and a return\nvisit was organised last week by the\nCommunity Action Group. It really was fun.\nWe rigged up a fence to stop the hall getting\nflooded again and began construction of a rope\nswing. We shall be returning on 2nd February.\nOn the same note, Art club will be joining us\non the project by painting murals on the wall\nwith the kids.\nFINNISTON\nOn9 th January a report was published\nwhich might have a fundamental effect on your\ncareer. As students of engineering it is\nimportant we concern ourselves with the\nFinniston Report. As a student union we\nshould concern ourselves with the educational\naspects. That is why in March there will be a major event Education Engineering Following\nFinniston.\nELECTION RULES\nOn Tuesday's UG M,I presented a motion\non election rules. This altered three areas:\ncandidates publicity, media and the appeals\nprocedure. The new election rules are:\n1. Enforcement\nThe enforcement of these rules shall be in the\nhands of the Elections Committee, which will\nconsist of the ICU Hon Secretary and Council\nmembers chosen at random. Subject to the\nconstraint that all candidates are satisfied with\nthe impartiality of the latter.\nThe Committee shall have the power to:\n1. Ratify an election.\n2. Order that the election procedure be re-run.\n3. Disqualify one or more candidates, without\nreference to aUG M.2 or 3 above may be order if:\na. One or more candidate goes beyond the\nlimits given below.\nb. There is evidence that one or more\ncandidate was prohibited or discouraged from\nusing FELIX, STOIC, or IC Radio or that\nsubmitted material was detrimental ly altered by\nthe editorial staff of such media. All Union\nmedia must be equally available to all\ncandidates.\nc.A candidate does permanent damage to any\nUnion or College area.\nd.A candidate directly attempts to influence\nthe impartiality of any member of the Section\nCommittee or Union staff.\ne.A candidate employs campaign tactics\ndesigned to give him/her an unfair advantage\nover the other candidates.\nf. The election is un constitutionally run by the\nReturning Officer.\ng. All media or newsletter reports or comments\non the election do not mention the names of all\nthe candidates standing for a post.\nAny decision taken shall require a simple\nmajority of the committee, the chairperson\nhaving the casting vote.\n2. Limits\na. The maximum amount which may be spent\non a campaign in one session will be decided\nby th Elections Committee and displayed when\npapers so up.\nb. The total area of publicity produced must\nnot exceed that of 300 posters and 6 reams of\nA4 handouts and must not appear prior to\npapers down.\nc. Material produced must be covered by an\ninvoice and/or bill.\nd. The use of Sherfield facilities must be\nreported immediately to the Hon Sec and or\nFEU X Editor.\ne. Gum backed material is not permitted\nf.CC U newspapers may not be used as media\nfor campaigns in ICU elections.\ng. The insignia of any current union publicity\nmay not appear on a candidates election\nmaterial.\n3. Objections\nObjections, except those directly relating to\nthe counting procedure (these may be lodged\nat any time up to the next U GM) may be\nlodged at anytime up to the commencement of\nthe count.\n4. Appeal\nAn appeal against a decision of the Election\nCommittee can be made only to the ICU Executive of which only the Returning Officer,\nmay sit on the Elections Committee.They shall\nhave the power to uphold or overrule the\nappeal.

Alteration\nThe alteration of these rules shall be subject\nto the approval of a two thirds majority of aUG M.6. Interpretation\nThe interpretation of these rules is at the\ndiscretion of the Elections Committee.\nPG GROUP CHAIRPERSON\nI recently learnt that Richard Earl, who held\nthe above post, would be leaving College\ntoday. He is hence ineligible to continue as a Union Officer. I am told by the secretary of the\nPG Group that papers will be going up next\nweek. A description of the job is as follows:\nThe PG Affairs Officer shall sit on the\nfollowing Union committees: ICU Council,\nWelfare Committee, and Academic Affairs\nCommittee. He/She shall advise members of\nthe Executive and other officers of the Union\non matters regarding PG students or PG\neducation. The PG Affairs Officer shall sit on\nthe Graduate Students Committee.

Also,\nin further education the proportion of girls doing\nscience to those doing arts is very low. Why is\nthis so?\nAre girls actually less capable of studying\nscience than boys or have they just been\nconditioned to believe that they are? Is science\ntaught in a 'masculine' way?\nWhere does this sexist bias begin? At home:\nwhere boys are often encouraged to do such\nthings as play with mecca no and help with\nbaking etc. How much do parents influence their\nchildren's choice of subjects at school by telling\ngirls they would never be able Jp get a job if they\ndid science at school etc. Do teachers ever\ndiscriminate against girls?

Contrary to\ncommon belief things do happen at Imperial, quite\noften important, and I.C. R.N. exists to report\non these occur en ces. What generally happens\nbehind the scenes is: after our reporter obtains\nthe story, for instance from one of the Union\noffices, it is brought back to the station and\nwritten up for that day's bulletins. In addition to\nour daily news coverage we have a weekly in-depth look at what has been happening around\nCollege. This programme is called'301 Newsline',\nand is broadcast between 6.40 and 7pm on\nWendesday evenings. In '301 Newsline' we\ngenerally find and interview the people\nresponsible for the news, thus bringing out\ncertain aspects of a story that cannot be put over\nin a news story.\nPossibly the key to being able to report on as\nmuch as we do and find sufficient news to\nproduce daily bulletins relies on organisation,\npossibly efficiency, but mainly on something\nhappening. If you know of something that you\nthink we might like to know about, then phone us\non Internal 3440 or contact the station.

    "content": "REVIEWS I ALBUMS\nEND OF THE CENTURY \u2014 THE RAMONES\nPhil Spector meets the cretin hoppers from\nNew York. Yes, the new Ramones LP is\nproduced by the 'Wall of Sound' man. The\nproduction is a wall of sound, which suits the\nRamones style very well.\nSide one commences with Rock'n 'Roll\nRadio, a song that sings the praise of\npre dic ably enough, rock'n 'roll radio as well as\nT Rex, Ed Sullivan, Alan Freed etc. Quite\ngood. f\"m Affected is more like it, chainsaw\nrhythm guitar and really ratty vocals from\nJoey, it's a love song actually, but only the\nRamones write love songs that sound like a sawmill at full production! The Life On The\nRoad song is next called Danny Says it's a heartfelt moan about not being able to surf in\nIdaho and the rig ours of touring, it's slow but\nbuilds up to loud finish. Chinese Rocks next,\nwhich is the definitive drug addicts song, good,\nfast and tacky. The Return Of Jackie And\nJudy which features Jackie (the punk) and\nJudy (the runt) who were first observed on the\nRamones first LP, this song is an attempt to\ngain further mileage out of the original song\n(Judy Is A Punk) but it doesn't really work in\nmy view and is a bit redundant. The last track\non side one is Let's Go which is the Ramones\nmoaning about not being able to go to\nVietnam, a long running theme in the Ramones\nhistory. Subject matter aside, it's quite a spiffy\nlittle song. Baby / Love You kicks off side two\nand it is god awful, to say it's the worst track\nI 've ever heard by the Ramones is an\nunderstatement. / Can't Make It On Time\nsalvages things somewhat, sounding like the\ndays of 1976/77, quite nostalgic really. This\nAin't Havana is in the same vein and is really\ngood, in fact I half expected a few Gabba\nGabba Heys in the chorus but had to settle for\n\"Ba-Ba-Bannana/This Ain't Havana\" but the\nsong is a real po goer which please me. The\ntitle song from Rock'n 'Roll Highschool is next\nand starts off with a power chord and feedback,\nin the best punk tradition i, and just leaps out\nof the speakers at about the speed of light, at rul ly great track. All They Way, even better as\nit has Dee Dee shouting 1-2-3-4 (or wu n too-free-fore to give it it s ethnic pronunciation),\nanother classic Ramones track that leaves\nsmoke coming out of the speakers, as does the\nlast track High Risk Insurance another buzz saw sound song that really zooms along.\nThis is a fairly good Ramones LP, most of\nthe songs are truly dumb with only two and a half really bad songs on it. It seems nothing\ncan stop the Ramones which is fine and I hope\nthey keep the cretins hopping (myself included)\nuntil the end of the century.\nSINGLES\nTHE SPECIAL AKA LIVE EP\nThree out of three for the Specials! The live\nEP that is the Specials latest release captures\nsome of the excitement of seeing (and hearing)\nthe band live. Side one was recorded at the\nLyceum and features Too Much, Too Young, a song from their LP about avoiding marriage,\nkids and the like until you're older. This ends\nand an old favourite Guns Of Navarone\ncompletes side one, by the Skatalites (I think)\noriginally it still sounds as fresh as ever. On side two we have the Skinhead Symphony\ncomprising of Long Shot Kick The Bucket,\nLiquidator and Skinhead Moonstomp. Being\nold enough to remember that oo old moon stomping at the turn of the last decade\nthese three songs brought a tear to my eye to\nhear these old favourites again, performed by\nthe Specials in immaculate style.\nSimon Jerome\nLADIES RUGBY\nThis was a return meeting of the two\nteams and turned out to be even\ncloser than the previous one.\nPlayed at Harlington in front of a good number of IC supporters and the\nNationwide television cameras, this\nwas a thoroughly entertaining and\nabsorbing match to watch. The game\nwas played in a hard but fair spirit and\nall the ladies put in 110%, which made\nall their training worthwhile.\nThe glory of the day went to the IC\npack. They were superb, winning set\nscrum s, through Barbara and line out s, through Claire, they were able to give,\nscrum half Fay a good deal of clean\npossession. Only a little inexperience\nin the 3s and some good tackling by\nUC prevented IC from winning this\nmatch.\nOnce again, the outstanding aspect\nof play was the tackling. Although\nlacking a little in strength and speed\ncompared to men, the ladies produced\ntextbook tackles with the best coming\nfrom Silvana, Fay and Jane. (These\nthree could teach the 1st XV a lot.)\nAlthough all the ladies played extremely well a special mention must\ngo to Fay, Julia (what a pair of hands!)\nand Shirley, who as captain led her\nside to a very capable performance of\nrugby football.\nTeam: Lynn, Lesley, Claire, Mary\nEr skin, Mary Harrington, Jenny, Barbara, Shirley, Faye, Cathy, Caroline,\nJulia, Sue, Jane and Silvana.\nEGB\nRUGBY\nIC 1st XV vs Kings College:\n6\u20143\nAs the score indicates this was a very close match and one that IC did\nWell to win.\nRight from the start, we knew it was\ngoing to be a hard match, with the\nforwards having to do a lot of the\nwork. All credit must go to the IC pack\nfor a spirited performance throughout\nthe whole game. They supplied the\nbacks, through Phil Ratcliffe, with a lot\nof good clean ball and we spent a lot\nof the first half attacking the Kings\ntry line. Due to some quick cover work by\ntheir back row, we were limited to a single try. This came about from a scrum on the Kings 25yd line. The ball\nwas won cleanly and fed to me at\nnumber ten. I gave a scissors pass to\nJohn Chandler, at inside centre, and\nhe used a sharp piece of acceleration\nto beat four players and score a well\nworked try.\nIn the second half with the wind\nfavouring Kings, we spent a good part\nof the time defending in our own half.\nDue to some solid tackling and cover work the only score that Kings\nmanaged was a single penalty kick.\nThis was a hard earned and well\ndeserved victory and continues our\nunbeaten record this term.\nEGB\nTABLE TENNIS\nOK, you've had all Christmas and\ntwo weeks extra to recover from last\nterm's reports . . . so this one is a doozy (a doozy is a dangerous animal\n\u2014 or did I dream it?). Anyway, back to\nthe start/ on to the end: Results( arranged partly chronologically and\npartly in the order they . . . no, that's too corny).\nIC 2nd vs EXILES 5th( AWAY): 5-4\nStean (late replacement) lost his\nfirst matches of the season (all of\n'em). Tye won two and member of\nstaff and new superstar John Blount\nwon all three . . . and then tn ere was\nChristmas.\nIC 3rd vs TEXACO 2nd:81 Next term, year, decade, same old\nsodding wins \u2014 just 'cos they're top of\ntheir division!\nIC 4th vs TEXACO 1 (AWAY): 5-4\nNow this was magic, defeating the.\nsecond team in the division from 2-4\ndown. Ho, Josefsson and epe ci ally Phil( I'm on a PhD now) Wilson showed how little I'm needed by the\nteam (except to cause cock-ups!).\nIC 2 vs GAINSFORD 4 (7-2)\nContinued revival by the seconds\n(Tye 2, Blount 2, and Etheridge 3 this\ntime) puts them in a much happier\nposition than had seemed likely a couple of months back (middle of the\ntable-ish).\nIC 4 vs EXILES v(36) This was a cup match (2nd round)\nbut with me playing, of course we lost.\nPee Aitch Dee won 2 (not bad), lost\none and well, you' ve all got C SE Maths haven't you?\nIC 1 vs GAINSFORD 4: (9-0)\nWith Kumar back in place of Petey\n(Tee, hee), this was an all Asian team,\nand look at the result: Hong and\nKartick were around somewhere.\nIC 2 vs HONG KONG SC(36) Success does not mean losing every\nset by 2 games to one, that means you\nGary and Phil; Blount showed the way\nwith three wins. God, if Roland Marslin could see Gary Etheridge he'd think he was looking in a mirror,\nsmash, oh, I 've missed it, smash . . .\noh, done it again, smash, smash . . .\nit's bound to work sooner or later . . .\nIC 4 vs LAW COURT\nFirst attempt, Hewkin gets wrong\nday, nice trip to Stand and back.\nSecond attempt, right day(50% success is fair ain't it?). We won by\nthe same margin as our first encounter\nwith them, but this time I won two\nsets. Max also won two and Wilson.\nonly won one.\n14\n\n"

Barry Took\nwill be the chairman.\nFREE TICKETS from ICU\nOffice.\nSir,\nIn a letter to FELIX regarding\nentertainment in this College,\nMick Berry referred to Imperial\nCollege Folk Club as catering\nfor \"specialised groups\". As I spend a large proportion of my\ntime attempting to convince\npeople of the opposite I feel\nthat this damaging remark cannot go unchallenged.\nIt is precisely this misinformed\nopinion of folk entertainment\nthat is the cause of the death\nblow to so many clubs, particularly in the London area and\neven more so in colleges. Many people, some of whom are\nmembers of folk clubs, have a preconceived idea of what constitutes a folk song.\nIf by specialised, Mr Berry\nmeans the type of music and\nartists, I would like to give him\na few comparisons. Compare if\nyou will: Gay and Terry Woods with Sam Stephens and Anne\nLennox-Martin; John Foreman\nwith Dave Burland; Nic Jones\nwith Les Barker; or Roaring\nJelly with Waterfall. As most of\nthe FELIX readership will most\nlikely be unfamiliar with those\nnames, I would like to point\nout that last term one of our\nguest bands, the celebrated Ratliffe Stout Band, finished off\nwith a medley of rock'n 'roll\nnumbers, also several of our\nfloor singers play far from traditional songs. In short, Mr Berry, there is no specific 'folk\nmusic'.\nI would also like to draw\nyour attention to two tra dt ional songs on record. The first,\nwhich I personally think is the\ndefinitive version, is Whiskey In\nThe Jar by Thin Lizzy and\nsecondly a 'punk' version of\nWild Rover by Jeep.\nImperial College Folk Club is\nalso ahead of similar clubs in\npresenting different forms of\nentertainment, our next event\nis a morris dancing workshop.\nThis may fall into some peoples\npreconception of folk, but it is\nthe first time that we have ever\nattempted such a venture. Also\na favourite performer at this\nclub is Les Barker, a poet who\nNOT AUG M REPORT GOTO AUG M TO FORGET IT ALL?\" I 'll have to admit it just slipped my\nmind,\" he said nonchalantly. Despite the\nfact that the President was referring to\nthe instructions arising from the great\nCorrie Anti-Abortion Bill debate (passed\nlast U GM) the crowd did not arise as one\nmass and devour him in a fit of anger.\nPerhaps those who attend UG Ms have\nbecome hardened to the idea that they\nare just talking shops?\nSTANDING ORDERS AND MOVING CLOAKROOMS We then learnt from the Deputy President that people who go to parties in\nthe J CR have little regard for their coats and\nfollowing this enlightenment from guru\nBrain we threw out a standing order change\nthus ensuring that he could speak at UG Ms for at least thirty minutes should we decide\nto give ourselves a thrill.\nMOTIONS The election rules were changed with no\nopposition but considerable confusion.\nHuman rights were agreed by all U be a good idea and could be legitimately\nenforced with the aid of telegrams. This\nmotion on the state of the world now\nincludes bits about South Africa and Afghanistan.\nGrants didn't do so well. By a small\nmajority we decided not to campaign for\nliberty from the poverty of the inner city by\nincreasing metropolitan student grants. It\nwas even suggested that not campaigning\nfor higher grants could help save the\neducation system.\nNO MORE HEROES? Just as we thought everything was over,\nJo Armitage arose and read out a new\namended motion on Apartheid. It aimed to\ndelete motions on job recruitment and\nsporting links passed at previous meetings\npacked out by members of the Royal School\nof Mines Union. You could only admire such courage\nat being prepared to stand up to the\ncollective wrath of R SMU at being taken\nunawares. At this meeting they were not\npresent in force and some were already\nbeginning to see th when the riot was\narrested by a procedural motion to adjourn\nto the next meeting.\n4\n\n"

She said students should accept a decrease in grants. \"A student on a full grant must be\nprepared to do without luxuries. We are fighting against\nthe education cuts. It is impossible to ask for extra\nmoney for students.\"\nThe motion which was proposed by Bernard Smith\ncalled for an immediate reappraisal of the grants system,\nparticularly with reference to\nLondon . The speech against by\nJo Armitage was enough to\ndefeat the motion by seven\nvotes. In an interview with\nFELIX, Bernard Smith said, \"/\nam very surprised that the UGM\ndecided not to support\ndiscussion on Student Grants,\nas we are now in a position\nwhere ICU is in favour of\nfreezing the present grant levels.\nThere was no mention of\nabolishment of the means test as\nthis is already Union policy, and\nhas the support of most (if not\nall) students at IC. This motion\nwas designed to help promote\ndiscussion on student grants and\nas such had the support of the\nExternal Affairs Committee. The\npresent grant level is only\nacceptable if students do not\naccept the following principles.\"\nMr Smith outlined his six\nprinciples:\n1) Students should have two\nsquare meals a day.\n2) Students should be able to\nclothe themselves.\n3) Students should live in heated\nand lighted rooms.\n4) Students should have the\nfunds to study using books and\nstationery.\n5) Students should not claim\nunemployment benefit during\nthe short vacations.\n6) The grant should allow\nstudents to participate in extra\nmural activities.\nMr Smith said that it is clear\nthat Jo and the majority of the\nU GM do not accept one (or\nmore) of these principles.\nNUS President, Trevor Phillips, said many bright school\nleave rs were seeing study as\n'second best' to getting a job\nstraight away because of the\ninadequate grants system. NUS is claiming for a rise in the full\nannual grant, for an average\nUniversity student outside London, of 36 per cent. The Daily Express described the\nNUS demand as the action of\nignorant louts.National Student\ndescribes the Daily Express\ncomments as vulgar abuse.\nEditorial comment - see back\npage\nImperial students raising money\nfor Rag by cleaning lam posts last weekend\nSteve Groves\nRally\nThe City and Guilds motor\nclub held a successful rally over\nthe weekend. The rally was\nevent i ally won by the Captain\nand Competition Secretary, in a Volkswagen. Second place went\nto Dave Ford and Mike Newton in an M.G. midget, and third\nplace went to Ed Quinten and\nBob Bradley. Not all entrants\nfinished the rally. One was\nunable to start as a mini ran into\nit only a few minutes after the\ndriver left college. Other casualties included one car\nwhich was withdrawn after its\nexhaust was knocked off and\none vehicle rolled over on the 50\nmile course. The car was later\nstopped by police as it was being\ndriven home from Sussex.\n* If you are interested in being\nthe Editor of the ICU handbook\nthen come to the Pub Board meeting, next Tuesday.

Keith,\nwho was twenty-one years old, drowned last\nweek off the Wilderness Coast, South Africa, while swimming with some friends.\nKeith had been educated at Allerton\nGrange Hill School where he was House\nCaptain and Headboy. He came to the\nRoyal School of Mines in 1977 to study\nMineral Technology, and had been an\nexcellent academic student, completing two\nyears in that course. It was for this reason\nthat he was selected for the award of one\nyear industrial work with the Anglo American Company in South Africa. He was due to complete his course at the RS M in October.\nKeith was also a keen sportsman, playing\nsquash and football for the Royal School of\nMines for two years.\nA memorial service will be held in Leeds\nlater this month.\nOur deepest sympathy goes to his mother\nand sister.\nRequiem In Pace.\nBernard Pryor\nMINES Term trundles on and the more idle\namong us still haven't completed last\nterm's reports.

Last Saturday despite the near arctic conditions twenty-five intrepid Guilds people set off for Harrods dressed suitably in pyjamas due to the early hour:\n9:30 in the morning. We collected \u00a3350 \u2014\nquite a lot due to Nick Pyne's legs and a well known Publicity Officer managed to\nget both a ten pound and a five pound\nnote.\nThe events coming up are:\nSaturday 26th January Recovering\nfrom the excesses of the D&D the previous night.\nTuesday29 th January: General Committee Meeting at 5 : 3 0 pm in the Union Dining Hall. See Sara if you want\nto observe at this meeting and come along and see how Guilds runs. The Assistant Honorary Secretary will also be\nelected at this meeting.\nThursday31 st January: Guilds vs\nMines Pedal Car Race. We still need\npeople to pedal for us, so come and see\nHenry Cur wen, either in the Union Office\nor in Princes Gardens where we will be\nhaving a practice every lunchtime. This is\nall in preparation for the Bristol 24 Hour Race.\nSaturday 2nd February: Inter C CU Monopoly. For this we all go out into\nLondon armed with bus passes which Rag will pay for and collecting cans to go\nround the places on Monopoly Board, answer some clues and collect lots of\nmoney. There will be prizes for answering\n.all the clues correctly and for the best\nmascot taken round by the teams. Teams\nshould consist of about four or five\npeople.\nCheers, Bryan.\nFENCING CLUB The Fencing Club is active on Thursdays from\n12:30 to 2:30. The Friday night sessions have been\ncancelled but in their place there are twice weekly\nforays to Salle Paul in Pimlico {there is transport). So\nif you think you need extra lessons come along to the\nGym at 5:30pm on Mondays and Wednesdays,\nbringing the usual gear, ie track suit and training\nshoes. Beginners still most welcome.\nThings are looking quite healthy now with regards\nto equipment, ever since our generous major claims\naward and team morale is very high since our\nvictories against QE C and Ealing College at the end\nof last term. This term should see sabre and e pee more in evidence at matches.\nGreg Kaye\nCaptain\nRCS The General Committee met for the\nfirst time this term on Tuesday, despite\nbeing a long drawn out affair, it did fulfil\nits task of looking after the management\nof RCS. There were, however, noticeably\nfew social representatives present as was\nthe case at the first Carnival Committee\nthis term. Obviously this is not a good\n, state of affairs. Social representatives are\nelected by their peers to sit on both these\ncommittees and if they don't turn up they\nare not fulfilling their responsibilities to\nthe people who elected them.\nElections are topical! Why? Issues\nforth s a plaintive cry from the depths of\nthe Bot/ Zoo Common room. The simple\nanswer is that on Saturday 16th February\npapers will be put up for next year's President, VicePresident, Honorary Secretary, Honorary Junior Treasurer and Academic Affairs Officer. This is only\nfour weeks away and needs serious consideration soon both by would be\ncandidates and voters.\nThese elections are perhaps of least\nimportance to the third years, so here's something just for them. Each year RCS A organises sherry parties for third year\nmembers of RCS and the dates this year\nare: Tuesday 19th February for Maths\nand Physics; and Thursday 6th March for\nChemistry and Life Sciences. Both will\ntake place at 6:00pm in Southside S CR. As mentioned in last week's FELIX the\nRCS soccer sixes take place on Sunday.\nThe coach leaves for Hariington from Beit\nArch at 12:30pm. Also mentioned was the\nEnts night out, although the destination is\na surprise, the meeting place will be the\n'Cockney Pride' at 5:30pm. The tickets\nwill be got on the student standby system\nso please remember to bring your union\ncard.\nNick Watmough\n3\n\n"

What about\nyou?\nThere is some danger that the\nendemic IC disease of apathy will\nmean that students will fail to make\ntheir opinions known with the result\nthat decisions will be made in\nignorance of what your feelings on\nthe subject are and which will\nadversely affect your future\naccommodation prospects.\nFor example, supposing the\nCollege was able to acquire new\nproperties or adapt existing ones,\nwhat pattern of requirements should\nbe aimed at? Should the College\nprovide flats, single rooms, doubles,\ntriples, dormitories or what? Should\nthe rents charged in any new\nschemes be bumped up to include\ncleaning and other services or would\nyou prefer to be able to chose how\nyou spend your money?\nIs it worth the College taking on\ncomparatively expensive places\nclose by or would you rather pay less\nand live in scruffy accommodation\nmiles away from College? Or should\nthe College wash its hands of the\nwhole business and leave you to the\ntender mercies of the flat-agencies\nand the Rachmans?\nWell, no-one really knows the\nanswers to these questions \u2014\nalthough the answers to some may\nseem fairly obvious \u2014 but without\nprecise information it is difficult for\nthe College to do a lot to help on\naccount of the risk of providing\naccommodation that no one wants\nand ending up having to foot an\nenormous bill.\nTo give a real example of the\ndilemma that this lack of information\ncauses, take the case of some flats in\nQueensgate that have recently been\nunder consideration. The flats have\nvery big rooms, all newly decorated\nwith high quality furniture \u2014 one flat\neven has a piano.\nSome of the rooms are the size of\n3/4 ordinary single rooms. In a shared room ie double, the rent\nwould be something over \u00a320 per\nweek and all within crawling distance\nof College.\nIf the College were to take these\nplaces on and nobody wanted them,\nit would all be a rather pointless and,\nof course, very expensive exercise.\nOn the other hand, if they are not\ntaken on it means that fifty people\nwho could have lived in them will\nprobably end up paying something\nsimilar \u2014 or more \u2014 in a less\nconvenient locality, like Streatham.\nThis kind of dilemma can only be\nresolved with the help of certain bits\nof information, eg: What rent would\nyou pay for somewhere close to\nCollege? If, say, you wanted to share\na flat with six friends, what would you\nsay to a place with two double\nbedrooms and one triple? How\nimportant is it to you to find\nsomewhere close to College? What\nsort of place do you want to live in ?\nWith all this sort of thing in mind\nand with the aforementioned seminar\nonly about eight weeks away, it\nwould seem to be of the greatest\nimportance for information on what\nyou want out of the accommodation\nsystem and what you are getting out\nof it already to be collected and made\navailable so that informed decisions\ncan be made which will help to ensure\nthat IC students are adequately\nhoused.\nIn order to collect this information\nthere is a section of the survey in this\nedition of FELIX which deals With\naccommodation.\nThere will be a photo competition\nfor pictures of your accommodation.\nFull details are printed elsewhere in\nFELIX.\nIf no-one shows any interest in this\nexercise, the College would be quite\njustified in saying to the Union that\nsince no-one seems to be in the least\nbit concerned about ac com moda tion, it can't be a problem and thus\nthe College can't be expected to\nwaste its hard pressed resources\non providing it.\nThe action that the College takes\nwill reflect the degree to which you\nparticipate in the seminar.\nIf you have any bright ideas\nabout the accommodation problem\nand the attempts made by the\nvarious agencies to solve il perhaps\nyou would like to come up to the\nWelfare Centre for a cup of coffee\nand a chat about it.\nChris Fox Michael Arthur8 "

    "content": "Interview with Dave Derby - by the Editor\nDave Derby, the Mirror Dinghy World\nChampion, flew back to Imperial earlier\nthis month. We managed to obtain a quick interview with Dave after one of his\nCivil Engineering exams. The talk was\nrecorded in the Ennismore and after\nfiltering out the pub noises and editing the\nconversation we ended up with only a few\nlines\nDave started sailing five years ago. His\nfather bought the Mirror Dinghy kit for\nhimself and he started hel ming while Dave\nwas crew. After six months they swapped\nover and by the end of the year Dave\ndecided that his father was \"too big, too\nslow and too heavy to be crew so I chucked him out.\"\nHowever, Dave's father went over to\nPerth to help with the attempt to win the\nWorldChampionship. He was team\nmanager.\nWith them was fourteen year old Chris\nBishop who was Dave's crew. Chris\nstarted sailing with Dave last summer\nwhen they won the southern area championships.\nWhile they were in Australia the team\ntook part in two championships. The\nAustralian championship week was first\nand Dave sailed two races a day for three\ndays. The overseas competitors competed\nin the event but they couldn't actually win\nthe Australian title but competed instead for\nthe Australian International trophy which\nDave won.\n/ did my bit\nfor Britain\nIn the second week there was racing\nalternately in the morning and in the\nafternoon. We had three races in the\nmornings when we had light winds and\nthree races in the afternoon with strong\nwinds. We were lucky enough to win the\npractice race and the first five points races\nand by the time we came to the last points\nrace we had already won the champion-ship. Due to over indulgence on the\nThursday night we only managed to\ncome third in the last one.\nWhile he was winning the Mirror Dinghy WorldChampionship, Dave\nexplained that he had to ration his time in\nAustralia. He carefully balanced the\npleasures of meeting the local girls \u2014\nSheilas that were magnetically attracted\ntowards him. Dave explained that he tried\nnot to over exert himself as he didn't want to detrimental ly affect his chances in\nthe world championship. \"I just kept the '\nBritish flag flying - I did my bit for\nBritain.\".\nThe conversation moved on to discussing\nthe more interesting side of Dave's visit to\nPerth but sadly the background noises in\nthe Ennismore were too loud for us to\ntranscribe the tape recording at this\npoint. The conversation turned to the\nOlympics.\nDave Derby\nThe Moscow Olympics clashed with\nDave's finals and so he hadn't considered\npreparing for the 1980 Olympics. Four\nyears from now the games should be held\nin Los Angeles and Dave said that there\nwas an 80% chance that he would try to\nbe in the Olympics in 1984. \"When you\nreach Olympic standard you have to\ncompete in many more foreign regattas\nand it's the expense of taking weeks of\ntime off work and being able to transport\nyourself, your crew, boat and gear\noverseas, costs of accommodation when\nyou're there and getting back again.\n\"You always need to get new gear,\nnew boats and sails. The most important\npart of asai ing boat is its sails - like the\nmotor of a racing car - no matter how\ngood the driver of the car is, unless\nyou've got the best motor . . . the best\nsails there's no way that you'll ever do\nanything.\"\nThere are\n63,000 Mirror dinghies\nbeing sailed in the world\nDave was sponsored by the Rector for\n\u00a3500 and he had help transporting his\nboat from Ocean Containers Ltd. Even\nwith local sponsorship from his home\ntown of Broadstairs, Dave had to put a lot of money into the venture. \"All the\nmoney that I earned during the summer\nworking was put towards going to\nAustralia. My relatives chipped in a bit as\nwell.\"\nThere are over 63,000 Mirror dinghies\nbeing sailed in the world, so there are a fair number of people who can compete\nfor places in the championships. \" You have to be selected in order to take part.\nIn 1979 we won the UK and European\ntitles and we were chosen along with four\nother British competitors including the\ndefending world champion Roy Partridge.\nThere were about twenty boats in the\nWorld Championship and over eighty in the\nAustralian event.\"\nGood luck\nin future events!\nDave came sixth in the last World\nChampionships which were held in Europe\nthree years ago. After winning this year\nDave has found considerable success at the\nage of twenty-one.\nIf his work allows him to compete in the\nOlympic trials and Dave is going to try to\narrange that it does, then we may see Dave\nwinning even more titles. FELIX wishes\nDave Derby the best of luck.\nFOX HUNTING\nINFORMATION\nThis term is going to be the term of the\nQuestionnaire. I CW A is arming itself with\nrelevant information with which to debate\nits future.\nFELIX is asking lots of questions, some\nof which will be about accommodation\n(see other part of FELIX), and later on in\nthe term there will be a personally delivered questionnaire on housing (but\nyou will find out about that if you are one\nof the lucky 10%).\nInformation, both gathering and disseminating it, is a major and vital job.\nHow can I attend a seminar on accommodation if I don't know what the majority of s tudes will accept? I can guess! But there must be more accuracy\nthan that.\nDisseminating info can be done through\nthis column( usually bad) or just by\nmeeting people (except not many of you\nstop and ask or tell!).\nMEDIA and THINGS\nThere is to be a recording made of the\nNews Quiz for Radio 4 next Thursday,(31 st), in the Union Concert Hall. If this is\nsuccessful there will be a further recording on 21st February, so please\nsupport it. Jonathan King will be there to\nboo at. Alan Core n( of Punch) and Jean Rook( of the Daily Express) will be there\ntoo.\nThe Ladies Rugby team has been receiving considerable coverage in the\nmedia recently. Almost without exception\nthe reports have trivial is ed the whole\nthing and by reporting it as a novelty\nhave defeated the object. Nevertheless,\nthey have done very well and I wish them\nall the best.\nEDUCATION CUTS COM M This met last Thursday and decided to\ncontinue with the petition to Edward Heath.\nThis is to encourage him to lead a back bench revolt on the overseas students\nissue. If you haven't already signed it, please\ndo so. There will be an MP lobbying session\nat Westminster on 13th February. Iam in\nthe process of compiling a sheet telling you how to lobby so if you feel strongly you can\nafford a few hours to lobby (if you can't make the 13th, then do another date!).\nSPIELKRIEG\nThis is the term when people get down and work (so I'm told) and sabbaticals\ndisappear into a melee of estimates, elections, and \" Dreams of Leaving\", but it\nreally is important that communication doesn't break down as on things like this\nseminar of accommodation it is vital that the\ncorrect viewpoint is put forward.\nTALLY HO!\nTHE FOX\n7\n\n"
