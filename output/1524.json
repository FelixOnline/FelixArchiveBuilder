The rebels are, however,\nclaiming that recent high profile defections of\ndiplomats and the Prime Minister of the Assad\nregime are weakening government forces. Kofi\nAnnan stepped down as UN envoy to Syria after\nthe failure of the peace plan, and UN presence in\nthe country has been reduced. The international\ncommunity is split on the topic, Russia and Iran\nsupport Assad\u2019s regime whilst France\u2019s Hollande\ncalled for the creation and recognition of a rebel\ngovernment and Egypt called for the support of\nthe rebels at the Non-Aligned Movement meeting in Tehran. Even with recent claims that President Assad\u2019s resignation is up for negotiation,\nthe crisis does not appear to have an end in sight\nand concerns that violence will spread in the region are growing.\nSyrian civil war\nItalian Cardinal Carla Maria Martini declared, in\nan interview published the day after his death,\nthat the Catholic Church is \u201c200 years out of\ndate\u201d. The Cardinal supported a modernisation\nof the Church. He claimed that it should be more\nopen to divorced families , and accept the use\nof condoms in certain circumstances. This interview comes amid the Church\u2019s recent image\ndifficulties following the highly publicised pae-dophilia scandals.\nSyrian civil war\nLondon hosted the 30th Olympiad. Not really\nsure if you noticed. No-one made a fuss about\nit really. So far deemed a success, the Games saw\nhost nation\u2019s Team GB win 65 medals, including\n29 Gold, and the Paralympic team performing\nwell. Visitors to the capital claimed to be impressed with the organisation, transport, food,\nand fantastic atmosphere. The Mayor of London\nBoris Johnson\u2019s vigorous presence fuelled speculation on his aspirations to become Prime Minister. The West End was worryingly abandoned\nby tourists and restaurants claimed business to\nbe down 70% compared to the previous summer.\nAs a consequence, the success of the sporting\nevent might be tampered by a financial failure,\nwith the bill yet to be revealed.\nSeb Coe suceeds\nWikileaks founder Julian Assange seeked refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London after\njudges ruled out his appeal against extradition\nto Sweden. Assange is accused of sexual assault\nbut claims the case is political and that the US is\nattempting to get their hands on him. Ecuador\nhas granted asylum to the Australian, leading to\na small diplomatic row with the UK. If Assange\nsteps foot on UK soil, he will be arrested if he\nand extradited, unless Sweden drops its case. He\nestimates that he will have to stay in the embassy up to another year until this happens. Or he\ncould try escaping in a diplomatic suitcase.\nAssange finds a\nnew home\nThe US presidential race has been heating up\nover the summer. Mitt Romney accepted the\nRepublican\u2019s presidential nomination at the\nparty conference and appointed Paul Ryan as\nhis running mate. Ryan is more conservative\nthan Romney and adding him to the Republican\nticket was a popular choice with the Tea Party.\nThe VP hopeful was criticised for inaccuracies\nin his party conference speech, and accused by\nfact checkers of misleading the public. After a\ngaffe-filled trip to Britain, Israel, and Poland,\nRomney still needs to convince Americans that\nhe can be Commander-in-Chief, but foreign\npolicy, compared to the economy, is not a debate that will affect the election much. Obama\nis struggling to raise the same momentum as for\nhis 2008 campaign and is tied in the polls with\nRomney. With the Democratic party conference coming up and the President\u2019s ale recipe\nout, the race is open. Americans will hit the\npolls Tuesday 6th November, with the world\nwatching.\nMr. President\n2013 will be a major transition year in the\nChinese leadership. The President and seven\nmembers of the Politburo will change, leading to a new ruling class. With different trends\nwithin the Communist party and other important political changes in the world, the transition will shape Chinese politics for the next\nfew years. China had an eventful summer with\nthe Bo Xilai scandal, and a territorial dispute\nwith Japan.\nChange in China\nWith tourism down and the generally dire economic conditions, Spain, Italy, and Greece are\nsuffering. Austerity measures are taking their toll\non the population, borrowing is still high, there\nis talk of more to come, and growth is still lack-ing. France and Germany, the leaders so far during the crisis, are in need of a new plan accommodating the newly elected French President\u2019s\nvery different ideas. Concerns that Euro exits\nfrom Greece or Finland will throw the entire\nzone off balance are ever increasing. European\nleaders will need to come up with a solution (or\nat least an idea for one) before the Euro zone\nmelts down with the Christmas snow.\nA possible\nEuropean tragedy\nIt might be the centre point of a new series of\nThe Thick of It, the Coalition is looking at a tough\nyear to come. Lib Dem attempts to reform the\nHouse of Lords were blocked by 91 Conservative\nMPs. In return, Nick Clegg has declared he won\u2019t\nsupport boundary changes for 2015. The economy is back in recession and tough decisions have\nto be made on the course to follow.

Thank you Matt, I owe you many, many drinks, and Fonzie Campos\nLOLCATZ OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nHere we go...\ney everyone! Welcome\nto Felix. I\u2019m Tim, and this\nyear I\u2019m the Editor of Felix, which is the totally ba-dass, awesome, independent student\nnewspaper of Imperial College London. Hopefully you\u2019ll end up reading\nthrough this and screaming \u201cshit yeah,\nthis is incredible, how can you sign me\nthe fuck up\u201d \u2013 or at least that\u2019s what I\nguess you\u2019ll say: freshers are notoriously foul mouthed. It feels odd to be in\nthe position that was created in 1949,\nand I feel a sense of immense respon-sibility. I really hope everyone will enjoy\nthis year of Felix, and that the slightly\nlighter hearted tone I plan to take will\nkeep you all entertained and informed\n(about everything but science, well,\nexcept for the stuff in the Science sec-tion) during lectures.\nNow I\u2019ve introduced myself, I should\nsay this: welcome to Imperial. Once\nmore, congrats on getting a place here.\nAll freshers will want to skip the next\nparagraph as, like the gun targeting\nyou, that\u2019s owned by a terrible marks-men, it\u2019s not aimed at you.\nTo those non-freshers reading this:\nthank you, from the bottom of my\nheart, for giving me the opportunity to\ndo this (by which I mean edit the pa-per, not frantically write and editorial at\n2pm on the day the paper needs to go\nto print). I really hope you enjoyed the\nsweets, embarrassing lecture shout-outs I did, and generally being annoyed\nduring lunchtime. I also hope you\u2019ve all\nhad a restful break.\nRight, freshers can read again; by\nwhich I mean after the whole paragraph skipping thing, I\u2019m not trying to\nimply that you lost the ability to read\nover the summer. Although, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve had a pretty chilled out sum-mer, and the closest thing to science\nyou\u2019ve been doing is studying the medals tables in the Olympics.\nSo, you\u2019re sitting in your room in\nhalls wondering what to do next? You\ncan hear a few people outside and\nyou aren\u2019t sure what to do. Well, here\u2019s\nwhere I\u2019m about to turn into Jeremy\nKyle, but slightly less of a dick, and give\nadvice you\u2019re going to have to just get\nout there and start chatting to people.\nTalk to everyone. I know it\u2019s intimidating and you\u2019ll be bricking it when you\nwalk up to a group of people who are\nalready talking as if they\u2019ve known\neach other all their lives, but it has to\nbe done. If you\u2019re struggling you can,\nof course, use the handy iron-on label\nwe\u2019ve made for you (it may not work\ntoo well).\nAdvice number two: have fun in your\nfirst year. Honestly, this year could be\nthe best you\u2019ve ever had. Your degree\nisn\u2019t a lamb, so don\u2019t sacrifice it (I\u2019m\nhere all night folks), but definitely don\u2019t\nlet your social life and fun suffer. Go\nout as much as possible, say yes to offers of nights out, try new things (like\nwriting for a student newspaper), and\ngenerally get out there and enjoy the\nuniversity lifestyle. It\u2019s all about finding that mythical balance between\nwork and play. The only way to do it is\nto work when you work, and chill when\nyou chill.\nYour first year is going to be the least\namount of work you have throughout\nyour entire degree, so don\u2019t pass up\nthe chance of a life time to piss about a\nbit. Just make sure you knuckle down\nhard when it comes time to do work.\nYou only get one shot at this degree,\nso enjoy it while working hard, or you\u2019ll\nalways regret throwing this amazing\nopportunity away!\nThe final thing to say is that if you\nwant to write for Felix all you need to do\nis email me at felix@imperial.ac.uk. It\ncan be a whole article, or just you saying you want in. If you\u2019re an illustrator,\nphotographer, designer, or just want a\nplace to drink tea, we\u2019re always ready\nto welcome you. Oh, and if you spot\nanything newsworthy, let me know.\n>> 8\nSCIENCE FASHION >>16 ARTS\nEffects of alcohol Fashion don\u2019ts Bluffing art\nIt\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Week. Or, to give it the official title:\nWelcome Week. This week we have a special section all about how alcohol makes you behave the\nway you do (in my case, like a bit of an idiot), and\nhow and why a hangover looms.\nWhat don\u2019t you wear in Freshers\u2019 Week? A blunt\nguide to what the fashionistas think isn\u2019t the correct way to dress. Then again, when they asked for\na \u201cguy who dresses well\u201d to write something and I\noffered they said no. So what do they know eh?\nIf you want to be a hipster, but don\u2019t know how\nthen don\u2019t worry. Arts have taken care of it for you.\nThey\u2019ve given you a guide to the best sites in London for some culture, as well as a great guide to being arty, without knowing anything about art.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk.

    "content": "FASHION\nFashion Editors: Alex Ramadan,\nSaskia Verhagen, Alice Yang\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA \u2013 Accessories\nIt\u2019s a well known fact that accessories can make or break an out\ufb01t so\nthank heavens for being in London!\nFrom charity shops to market stalls,\nhigh street sales to Bond Street gold,\nwhether it\u2019s dainty handmade items\nor bold statement pieces that you\u2019re\nlooking for, it\u2019s sure to be lying around\nsomewhere in London just waiting to\nbe found.\nB \u2013 Beauty\nFor essentials Boots and Superdrug\nare plentiful in the city. For make-up\nbrands most department stores have\nlarge make-up sections with a good\nrange of products such as Clinique,\nBobbi Brown and Laura Mercier. A\nspecial mention goes to Mac with\nstores across the city, this brand has\nan extensive range and is great value\nfor money.\nC \u2013 Charity shops\nA great way to update your wardrobe\nand donate to a charity without making a massive dent in your student\nloan. Be sure to check out Oxfam in\nDalston Junction for vintage clothes,\nBritish Red Cross in Chelsea for designer pieces on the cheap, and Salvation Army just o\ufb00 Oxford Street for\nhigh street seconds.\nD \u2013 Department Stores\nHarrods, Selfridges, Liberty, and Harvey Nichols are just some of the great\ndepartment stores London has to of-fer. They stock a wide range of clothing in various price ranges from high\nstreet to luxury brands. Particular\nhighlights include the Harrods Ice\nCream Parlour and Liberty\u2019s stationery department.\nE \u2013 Ebay\nE\ufb00ectively the world\u2019s largest car boot\nsale: if you\u2019re looking for something\nquirky or sold out you will most likely\n\ufb01nd it on ebay. In need of a wardrobe\nclear out? Ebay is a great way to make\nsome cash to top up your student loan\nF \u2013 Fresher events\nMost of our favourite high street stores\nwill be holding speci\ufb01c student shopping nights this October where you\ncan team cocktails and DJs with special o\ufb00ers and extra discounts, perfect\nfor updating your new student-sized\nwardrobe. Topshop, River Island, and\nUrban Out\ufb01tters sit somewhere at the\ntop of the list, but keep your eyes and\nears open for more.\nG \u2013 Gymwear\nEthos, the Imperial gym and swimming pool are free for all students,\nwith that in mind you\u2019d be mad not\nto take advantage. For the boys JD,\nJJB Sports and Sportsdirect are good\nfor cheap gym wear, while for the girls\ntry Gap Body and Sweaty Betty. Nike\nTown at Oxford Circus is great for\nsports shoes and clothes for all.\nH \u2013 Hair\nNothing beats a good haircut. Toni\nand Guy, Headmasters, and Rush all\nhave branches across the city and o\ufb00er\nstudent discounts. Rush even give you\n50% o\ufb00 your \ufb01rst visit to them. For a\ngood barber, head to central london\nwhere you\u2019ll \ufb01nd many, try Murdock\nor Joe and Co for a great cut with minimal fuss. In desperate need of a cut\nbut seriously low on funds? Hairdressing training academies are great for a\nvery cheap cut: Aveda, Vidal Sassoon,\nand Toni and Guy all have academies\nin central london.\nI \u2013 Inspiration\nWith the internet at our \ufb01ngertips\nlittered with blogs and online maga-zines, there\u2019s hardly a drought for in-spiration. Yet sometimes, we just prefer to sit and watch the ideas walk by.\nSome of the best style spotting locations include Somerset House (around\nFashion Week), Oxford Circus (i.e.\nTopshop\u2019s gang of walking advertise-ments), Soho, Shoreditch, Brick Lane\nand of course around South Kensington itself (try heading towards Harrods from College).\nJ \u2013 Jeans\nIf jeans are a key item in your wardrobe it is worth investing in a good\nquality pair. An ill-\ufb01tting pair will\nmake you feel uncomfortable and look\nbad. It can be hard \ufb01nding a pair that\n\ufb01ts you well, but it\u2019s worth persevering as the results will be well worth it.\nLevi\u2019s, Lee, 7 for all mankind, and Gap\nall have a wide range of cuts, washes\nand prices and are good places to start\nyour search.\nK \u2013 Knitwear\nThe new \u2018IT\u2019 item, knitwear has been\ngradually making its way out of the\nback of the wardrobe, and this year\nit\u2019s bigger than ever. Whether you like\npatterned granny knits, casual slouchy\nnumbers or big \ufb02u\ufb00y jumpers covered\nin mohair and rabbit fur, you\u2019re sure\nto \ufb01nd it here. Investing in a couple\nof one-o\ufb00 pieces can be daunting,\nbut watch this space for our Autumn/\nWinter updates to help you keep on\ntop of this season\u2019s latest trends.\nL \u2013 Lingerie (girls)\nLa Senza, Ann Summers and the\nnewly opened Victoria Secret Angels\n\u2013 London has it all. But perhaps a\nbit o\ufb00 the beaten track there\u2019s always\nvintage slip dresses and boutique designers especially if you\u2019re keen on the\n\u2018underwear as outerwear\u2019 trend.\nM - Magazines\nVogue (UK/Italia/French/US), Elle,\nGQ, i-D, and Dazed & Confused are\nthe obvious choices here for good rea-son. For something a bit less readily\navailable, yet full of inspiration and\nnew ideas, try Rankin\u2019s new bi-annual\nHunger, or Vice if you\u2019re feeling particularly alternative.\nN - Night out\nA bit of advice, London is NOT Essex, Newcastle or Liverpool so please\ndon\u2019t look to trashy reality TV shows\nwhen dressing for a night out. Instead,\ndo a little research and dress appro-priately. A few ground rules: Guys,\ngenerally avoid jeans and trainers and\nalso stay away from overly shiny suits\n\u2013 they\u2019re anything but classy. Girls,\nwear heels you can walk in, and most\nimportantly dance and stumble home\nin, but keep to boots if you\u2019re hitting\nup Ministry of Sound or Fabric etc.\nFor the standard student night out a\nnice top and shorts/skirt will do nice-ly, but stick to smart cocktail dresses\nfor anywhere in South Kensington\nor Mayfair, after all that is where the\nRoyals party.\nO - Outerwear\nIf your wallet can take it, Burberry is\nthe place to go for well tailored outer-wear, but if not may we suggest Barbour, Zara or Topshop. Vintage stores\nhowever are always a more reasonably\npriced option for that new statement\ncoat.\nP - Portobello\nThe famous Portobello Market opens\nevery Saturday and is nicely signposted from Notting Hill Gate tube allowing for maximum e\ufb03ciency in \ufb01nding\nthose vintage jewels we all crave so\nmuch. Should you happen to venture\ntowards Portobello during the week,\nmake sure you check out the chain of\nRetro Clothing stores for a cheeky bit\nof vintage Dior or YSL.\nQ - UniQlo\nBetter quality than H&M and cheaper\nthan American Apparel, Uniqlo is the\nplace to go for your wardrobe basics\nin a wide range of colours. Their men\u2019s\nmerino wool and cashmere jumpers\nare great staples and their Heattech\nclothing is a great alternative to thermals in the winter.\nR \u2013 Revisionwear\nWhereas the answer to this may have\nbeen \u2018Primark\u2019 in the days of GCSEs, it should now most de\ufb01nitely be\nanything but. For reasonably priced,\ncomfortable yet chic lounge-around-clothing try Vero Moda on Oxford\nStreet, and of course the obvious option of H&M.\nS \u2013 Socks\nDearest male readers, socks can be\nyour best friend and worst enemy all\nat once. By this, we are referring to\npatterned socks (friend), socks with\nholes (gross!) and white socks paired\nwith anything other than white trousers (foe). So if you happen to \ufb01nd\nyourself reaching into an all-white\nsock drawer without the white Elvis\n\ufb02ares to accompany them, it\u2019s time\nyou took some light retail therapy*.\nInstead, every man should have a couple of pairs of black/grey/navy socks\nfor smart occasions with fun colour-fully-patterned pairs making up the\nrest. A cheap but e\ufb00ective revamp,\nthis is something better done sooner\nrather than later.\n* If you also have white Elvis \ufb02ares\nplease refer to intense treatment and\nmake your way to the Felix o\ufb03ce im-mediately.\nT - Topshop\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned it a hundred times and there\u2019s no denying that\nTopshop/Topman is a comforting staple for guys and girls alike. And being in London we couldn\u2019t go without\nmentioning Topshop\u2019s \ufb02agship store\nin Oxford Circus. At 5 \ufb02oors, this haven o\ufb00ers everything you could possibly need - hair and nail salons, beauty\ncounters,w an entire \ufb02oor of accesso-ries, a dazzling array of shoes, oh and\ndid we mention clothes?\nU - Underwear (guys)\nTwo words: Calvin Klein. And perhaps by now you\u2019ve noticed the lack\nof male contribution to this section.\nSo please, do get in touch if you\u2019d like\nto get involved and contribute to the\nmen\u2019s side of fashion.\nV - Vintage\nIf you\u2019re a fan of vintage shopping\nyou\u2019re in the right city for it. Most\nshops have a good selection but can\nsometimes be overpriced. Check out\nThe East End Thrift Store, Beyond\nRetro and Retro Man for the best bar-gains. Fancy designer vintage? Mint,\nLucy in Disguise, and Absolute Vintage all have excellent selections.\nW - Window shopping\nFor when your student loan is looking\nthin, window shopping is perhaps the\nbest form of retail therapy. Best seen\nduring the Christmas season, the best\nwindow displays include Harrods,\nLiberty, Selfridges and Harvey Nichols - it\u2019s well styled, on trend and, most\nimportantly, free.\nX - XS/XL\nShopping can be a nightmare if you\nare really tall/small or have really\nsmall/large feet. For the tiny and tall\ngirls a lot of the high street shops\nhave petite and tall ranges, which, although smaller, are generally on a par\nwith the other collections. For shoes\nmost shops stock a range of sizes from\n3-8, although O\ufb03ce and ASOS often stocks sizes 2.5 and 9. Menswear\nis slightly trickier. On the high street\nBurton and Next have ranges for the\ntaller and broader man, and for shoes\nHigh and Mighty has a wide range up\nto a size 17. If you are a smaller man\ncarefully selected womenswear can\nbe your friend, however you may face\ncriticism if you get said look wrong*.\n*We refer delicately here to over-exag-gerated bulges.\nY - Why?\nWhy dress well? For a more in-depth\npoint of view look out for Saskia Verhagen\u2019s piece in comment in the \ufb01rst\ncampus edition of Felix (5th October).\nZ - Zara\nThank God for Zara, truly a saviour\nstore for every possible occasion. It\u2019s\nchic, cheap(ish) and always on trend.\nGood quality basics make it perfect\nfor solving wardrobe crises, and its\nrange of well \ufb01tted shirts and jackets\nmakes mastering the dreaded \u2018smart\ncasual\u2019 easy for both sexes.\nThe A-Z of Fashion\nAlex Ramadan, Saskia Verhagen, and Alice Yang make an\nindex of all things fashion, so you don\u2019t have to.\nNIETZSCH\nE\nMaybe I\u2019ll write\nfor Felix Fashion\nby sending stuff in\nto fashion.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\n17\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\n\n"

    "content": "\u201d\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: George\nBarnett, Navid Nabijou, James\nSimpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nh freshers. Hello there.\nWe here in the Comment section like nothing more than a good\nrant (more on that lat-er). Having just started your journey\nthrough Imperial you may not feel the\nneed to rant quite yet. You will undoubtedly be excited for your new life\nin London; meeting new people, living\naway from home, (the quim,) and so\non. I\u2019m sure for a few weeks, maybe\neven months you\u2019ll enjoy the easy life\nthat is being a fresher; turning up to\nlectures drunk (or not bothering at all\n\u2013 the easier, more digni\ufb01ed option),\nnot having deadlines, having a social\nlife, you get the picture.\nBefore I paint a picture that has you\nqueuing like lemmings to jump o\ufb00 the\nQueen\u2019s Tower I should reassure you\nthat it isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. (As a\nbrief side note; if you do plan on taking the plunge may I urge you to jump\naway from the lawn - we\u2019d rather keep\nit available for use during the few days\nof the year a marquee isn\u2019t pitched on\nit.) You\u2019ll probably \ufb01nd that the workload will steadily grow and as it grows\nyou\u2019ll need to balance that work with\nplay to keep yourself sane (and alive.)\nWithout trying to sound too much\nlike an advert, might I suggest writing for Felix? It\u2019s fun, weirdly relaxing\nand surprisingly rewarding. I certainly\n\ufb01nd it strangely satisfying when I see\nsomeone reading one my comments\nor articles. It provides a somewhat\nwarming feeling to know that out of\nhow-ever-many-thousands of copies that are circulated each week at\nleast a few handfuls of students will\nread and appreciate your work. You\nmay even inspire them to write something in return. You don\u2019t even have\nto be any good at writing (you might\nhave already picked up on that one),\nalthough a vague grasp of the English\nlanguage is considered convenient.\nSo, you\u2019ve decided you want to give\nit a go. Good decision \u2013 well done.\nYou\u2019re now faced with that oh-so-irritating problem; \u201cwhat shall I write\nabout?\u201d Well that is entirely up to you.\nTake a \ufb02ick through this \ufb01ne publication and see if anything causes a\ncreative stir in the depths of your right\nbrain.\nYou could review your favourite TV\nshow, \ufb01lm, restaurant or book. Write\nabout fashion or news or some crazy\nscience that none of us know about. Or\nyou can get personal; write your views\non something that you feel strongly\nabout. Let the world (well, just Imperial really) know your thoughts on\nsomething that\u2019s important to you.\nI\u2019ll admit some bias here \u2013 I much\nprefer the latter. You\u2019d be surprised\nhow hard it is to review a TV show\nor an album without sounding like a\ncomplete tool (I\u2019ve tried). So write a\ncomment piece for us, I urge you. It\u2019s\neasier than you think; you don\u2019t have\nto come to a conclusion, you can just\ntoss ideas and thoughts around the\npage until you end up with something\nthat vaguely resembles a piece of interesting writing. One of the best aspects of writing comments is you\u2019re\nfree to write whatever you want \u2013 it\u2019s\nyour own opinion so feel free to be as\noutlandish or as reserved as you wish.\nhe more astute of you should\nhave noticed that I haven\u2019t yet spoken about ranting. Well the time has\ncome. What I like to think of as a more\nA vaguely motivational title\n... take the\nplunge...\njoin the\nFelix family and give\nwriting a go\nham-\ufb01sted approach to writing comments is actually my favourite. You\nsee, so many things irritate me on a\ndaily basis, from the people busking\nin the subway between college and\nSouth Kensington tube station (seri-ously, if you\u2019re not good enough to be\nin a band and can\u2019t a\ufb00ord music lessons then get the hint), people walking\ntoo slowly, the price of razor blades,\nthe fact I still haven\u2019t won the lottery\n(one day, one day...). he list goes on\nbut the message is clear \u2013 there are\nplenty of things to write about. So go\non then, take the plunge (into the Felix\nO\ufb03ce this time) \u2013 join the Felix family\nand give writing a go.\nBringing you a blast\nfrom the past\nGeorge Barnett\nt being Freshers\u2019 Week, you\u2019ll\nno doubt be busy settling into\nyour new surroundings: a new\nhome, a new university and\nabove all a whole load of new\nfaces. Among these new faces, you\nmay \ufb01nd some who are a tad dissatis\ufb01ed with the student life at Imperial.\nFrom them, you\u2019ll learn all about how\n\u201clame\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d the campus life is\nhere; how much more fun people are\nhaving over at UCL and LSE; and how\nthe gender ratio (one topic of discussion which never seems out of vogue)\nreally sucks.\nImperial\u2019s reputation precedes itself:\nwe are known, above all, for being a\nboring university. You\u2019ve never heard\nof someone being drawn to Imperial\nby its edgy club scene.\nhis stereotype has a few main caus-es. First and foremost, the predominance of science subjects leads people\nto assume that the students here are\ninterested in equations, lab work and\nnot much else. Couple this with the\nHerculean workload expected of us,\nand it\u2019s not hard to see where the vision of Imperial, as a place where you\nshut yourself o\ufb00 from society and\nwork yourself to the bone for three to\nfour years has its roots.\nBut beneath this popping-pro-plus-in-the-library surface, there\u2019s a vibrant\nstudent life waiting to be found: you\njust have to look for it. hough there\nare people here who don\u2019t care much\nfor the world outside the lecture thea-tre, there are hundreds \u2013 nay, thousands \u2013 of students having a great\ntime outside their courses.\nTake Felix. his paper goes to print\nevery week and relies on the contributions of literally hundreds of student\nvolunteers, working together to produce something absolutely great (for\nmore on the virtues of joining the Felix team, see George\u2019s article above). If\nnewspapers aren\u2019t your thing, not to\nworry: how about a dance society, or\none geared around \ufb01ne art? You could\ntry your hand at juggling, or give debating a go. hat\u2019s not even to mention\nthe myriad sports clubs that compete\nevery Wednesday, before descending\non the Union for some post-match\nrevelry.\nHere\u2019s something that might come\nas a surprise to you: Imperial has over\n300 o\ufb03cial Clubs and Societies, one\nof the highest \ufb01gures in the country.\nhese are all real and active contributors to university life. At them you\u2019ll\nmeet tons of interesting people, determined to make the most of their time\nat Imperial.\nSo how much fun is Imperial? hat\u2019s\nentirely up to you. If you sincerely\nwant to spend day and night with your\nhead buried in a textbook, then more\npower to you. But for everyone else,\nknow that that isn\u2019t the only way. You\ncan be as involved with or as detached\nfrom the student life as you want to be.\nNavid Nabijou\nImperial is whatever you want to make it\nI\n... take th\n... take t\nplunge...\nplunge...\nj i th\ni th\n... there\u2019s a vibrant student\nlife waiting to\nbe found\nComment Editor\nComment Editor\nA\nOh, go on, you know you want to read more after that title...\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be\nthis way!\n15\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\n\n"

Ouch, my head hurts...\nSCIENCE\nIN BRIEF\nWhile you were anxiously awaiting results\nA sad farewell to Neil Armstrong\nThe first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, passed away on August 25th, aged\n82. Barack Obama, US President, honoured the astronaut, calling him a \u201chero not\njust of his time, but of all time\u201d. Tributes have poured in for Armstrong, from Buzz\nAldrin, second man on the moon and fellow member of the mission, to former\nNASA astronauts.\nDespite calls for a state funeral, Armstrong\u2019s funeral was held at a private service\nin Ohio, but he was commemorated with flags flown at half-mast throughout the\nUnited States. Last November, Armstrong was awarded the Congressional Gold\nMedal, an award given to civilians from the United States, and he has in the past\nbeen granted freedom of the town for the Scottish town of Langholm, his ancestral home.\nBBC rediscover moon landing footage\nThe Apollo 11 mission, of which Armstrong was a part of, was broadcast worldwide when they landed in late July 1969. The significance of this event, clearly,\ndid not stop the BBC from managing to loose their recording of the lunar landing.\nHowever, thanks to a viewer, aged 12 when he recorded the footage, the BBC have\nregained a copy of this originally thought lost recording, and is now available for\nviewing on the BBC News website, featuring Armstrong\u2019s famous \u2018One small step\nfor man\u2019 words.\nHiggs boson found?\nResearchers at the LHC at CERN, Switzerland reported the discovery of a new boson in both their CMS and ATLAS experiments. This boson, with a mass around\n126 GeV/c2, could potentially be the Higgs boson, named after the scientist who\nproposed the particle. Whether this particle is the Higgs or not depends on reducing the uncertainty within the experiments: while the behaviour of the boson is\nconsistent with that expected for the Higgs, further research into the decay of the\nboson, as well as its quantum numbers is necessary. This is in addition to further\nwork to improve the certainty of the result. It is expected that the findings from\nthis further research will be reported in December.\nCERN are keen to stress that the result is only consistent with the Higgs boson,\nand is not yet proof of the existence of the particle. Earlier this year, two members\nof the OPERA collaboration (who reported a faster than light neutrino, which was\nlater found to be not the case) resigned following sensationalized reporting of\ntheir results, which were later found wrong following equipment improvements.\nSandwich saved in buyout\nPfizer\u2019s research site at Sandwich in Kent has been saved after a buyout by a group\nof private companies, according to Kent County Council. This development is significant due to the high number of people being made redundant: 2400 jobs were\nat risk, though Pfizer promised to retain 650 employees.\nOne of the companies who have paid for a bit of Sandwich is Mylan, a producer\nof generic drugs. This includes former Pfizer employees moving to Mylan, who is\nopening a \u2018Centre of Excellence\u2019 at Sandwich for their respiratory development\ndivision. Other former employees have also opened start-ups at the site.\nOpen Access championed by the EU\nOpen Access, a method of publication where access to papers is free of charge, has\nreceived a big boost in support by the European Union, who recently announced\nall research funded by its Horizon 2020 programme will be released free of charge.\nThis follows a similar announcement by the United Kingdom to do similar for all\npublically funded research by 2014.\nThe UK has chosen to take the \u2018Gold\u2019 method: where anyone can access the\nresearch as soon as it\u2019s published (paid for by the author), whereas the EU has\nallowed authors to opt for the \u2018Gold\u2019 or \u2018Green\u2019 methods, the latter is where the\narticles later come available after being in a paid-for journal.\nThis follows a campaign, with support from some Imperial researchers, and covered in Felix last year, to boycott journal publisher Elsevier for high costs, amongst\nother reasons.\nPhilip Kent\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cLying in bed, promising to never drink again, while desperately\ntrying to summon up the strength to make tea\u201d\nTim Arbabzadah, Editor-in-Chief\n\u201cLiterally just drink water during the night.

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n6\nTim: What is Co-Curricular studies,\nif you had to sum it up quickly?\nEryl: Co-Curricular studies is the new\ntitle for what was formerly called the\nDepartment of Humanities. So it\u2019s a\nnew branding of that and it includes\nthe languages, it includes the evening\nclasses and it includes what was previously the humanities subjects that were\ntaught across the week.\nT: What kind of courses are o\ufb00ered in\nthe Imperial Horizons programme?\nE: here are four distinct strands:\nthere\u2019s Languages and Culture. here\u2019s\na strand called Global Challenges where\nthere\u2019s a di\ufb00erent theme each term. he\n\ufb01rst term theme is Global Warming and\nthe second term\u2019s theme is Water and\nHealth. We\u2019ve got Business, which is delivered as a large lecture format by the\nBusiness School. And then the fourth\none is Science, Culture and Society and\nthere\u2019s a whole series of smaller options\nthat people can take there. hings like\nScience and Museums, Science and\nVisual Culture, Science and Literature,\nScience and Faith, Sound Technology...\nWhat we want to stress is that the evening language provision will continue\nand probably even develop so that if a\nstudent wants to do a language on top\nof their course \u2013 if they think they can\n\ufb01t it around their studies \u2013 then they\ncan come along to an evening class.\nSo Humanities isn\u2019t ending, it\u2019s being\nrebranded as Horizons for \ufb01rst years,\nbut the humanities will continue in the\nlunchtime slots as it has done previous-ly, for second and third years this year,\nand after that it\u2019s going to be phased\nout.\nPart of this programme is about\nbroadening students\u2019 horizons, so they\naren\u2019t sort of seen as narrowly focused\non Physics or Life Sciences, for exam-ple, and they\u2019ve got something to talk\nabout with respect to employers.\nT: Are the current lecturers of Humanities and Languages remaining?\nE: I think there\u2019s been some concern\nabout people losing their jobs. In terms\nof the academic sta\ufb00, we\u2019re recruiting\nsome new sta\ufb00 to deliver the Horizons\nprogramme. As the courses roll out,\nthey\u2019ll be delivering less of the old Humanities courses and instead they\u2019ll be\ndelivering the new Horizons courses.\nT: What is your background in terms\nof Higher Education?\nE: My background\u2019s in Media and Performing Arts. I did my PhD at Kings.\nMy PhD\u2019s in heology, although I\u2019m\nan athiest, but I\u2019m very interested in\nreligion and faith. I\u2019m actually please\nthat one of the Horizons courses is\nabout Science and Faith because I think\nthere\u2019s a lot of very interesting debate to\nbe had in that area. My specialism as a\nteacher was really in radio, particularly\ncommunity radio and more sort of experimental forms of abstract radio like\noral sculpture and radio arts. I was a\nprincipal lecturer and a teaching fellow\nat what was hames Valley University.\nI was a head of department there and\ndirector of studies.\nI\u2019m very keen on motorbikes. One\nof the reasons I was excited about the\nImperial job was that a few years ago\nImperial entered a bike in the TT races\nand I\u2019ve yet to \ufb01nd it, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s\nsomewhere lurking in the corner of an\nengineering workshop.\nT: And you\u2019re keen to get Imperial\nstudents a \u2018bit more arty\u2019\n, as it were?\nE: Well I think that\u2019s not a bad thing.\nI\u2019m keen for Imperial students to think\nabout the cultural impact of what they\ndo and also to ask some questions about\ntruth and knowledge. I think scientists\noften take truth and knowledge for\ngranted, whereas I think artists would\nclaim \u2013 a lot of them \u2013 that they also\nhave access to truth, in many di\ufb00erent\nways. We have a fantastic geographical situation here, we have the Royal\nCollege of Arts, the Royal College of\nMusic, all the museums. So I think the\nopportunities for co-curricular studies are enormous. I see it as part of my\nbrief in the coming months and coming years to make much stronger links\nwith the Royal College of Arts and the\nRoyal Albert Hall and all of those places\nso that Imperial is reaching out and our\nstudents are bene\ufb01tting from all those\nconnections.\nT: Why should \ufb01rst year students\ngrab this chance by the horns?\nE: I think it\u2019ll give them the chance to\nexperience something new and di\ufb00erent taught by top quality professionals\nand experts in those subject areas \u2013 and\nthey\u2019ll have a really good time!\nMinor factual innacuracies have been\ncorrected from the print edition of this\narticle.\nOpening up new Horizons?\nWe interview the Head of Co-Curricular studies, Eryl Price-Davies\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\nNew courses to broaden your education and enhance your potential\nFor all irst year undergraduates.

    "content": "Alternative Music Society show you their favourite record labels\nanticon.\nFounded in Bay Area California in 1998,\nanticon is a collectively owned and run\nlabel that produces hip-hop like you\u2019ve\nnever heard before. Rappers such as\nDoseone, Odd Nosdam, and Yoni\nWolf have lent their incredible, distinctive voices and witty lyrics to a host\nof di\ufb00erent bands and collaborations.\nMore recently, the label has opened up\nto other styles, signing indie-rock and\nelectronic musicians \u2013 each as quirky\nand original as the founding members\n- such as the glitchy West Coast beat\nproducer Baths.\nBands to check out: cLOUDDEAD,\nWhy?, Deep Puddle Dynamics, hee\nMore Shallows, Baths.\nWarp Records\nA legendary name in electronic music,\nBritish label Warp has signed some of\nthe most pioneering names in house,\ntechno, idm, and dubstep throughout the 90s and 00s. Most notably,\nthe elusive Scottish duo Boards of\nCanada, and Aphex Twin (one of the\nmany monikers of Richard D James)\nhave released highly-in\ufb02uential ambient and idm albums on Warp. Aggressively complex beats, analogue synths\nand eerie samples feature in many of\nthe label\u2019s acts, tasters of which can be\nheard in the compilations Warp10 and\nWarp20, summarising its \ufb01rst and second decades of existence.\nBands to check out: Aphex Twin, Battles, Clark, Boards of Canada, Flying\nLotus, Mount Kimbie, Hudson Mohawke.\nHyperdub\nFounded and owned by seminal DJ and\nproducer Kode9, Hyperdub is a name\nsynonymous with dubstep, and is home\nto the genre\u2019s most prominent poster\nboy: Burial. The label\u2019s small collection\nof artists all share a dark, deep, haunted quality to their sound, reminiscent\nof (and best enjoyed by) wandering\naround south London late at night.\nSeveral of the acts escape the strictest\nde\ufb01nition of dubstep; notably, the label\nfeatures two out of a very few female\nproducers in electronic music: Ikonika\nand Laurel Halo, who push the genre\nin interesting new ways.\nBands to check out: Burial, Kode9,\nJoker, Darkstar, Zomby.\nFat Possum Records\nInitially founded with a focus on blues,\nthis label from Oxford, Mississippi, has\nexpanded massively. Though they\u2019ve\nsought to retain a focus on guitar-based\nmusic, signing acts like the serene\ndream-pop artist Youth Lagoon, rising\npsych stars Melody\u2019s Echo Chamber,\nand noise rock acts like Yuck, Fat Possum have other interests too; examples\ninclude Chillwave group Gross Magic\nand even rapper El-P. But, broad as\ntheir range is, it\u2019s still guitar music that\nthese guys do best.\nBands to check out: Andrew Bird,\nUnknown Mortal Orchestra, Youth\nLagoon, Melody\u2019s Echo Chamber,\nTennis.\nK Records\nFounded by Beat Happening\u2019s Calvin Johnson to release records for his\nfriends, K Records is an in\ufb02uential label\nbased in Olympia, Washington. Their\no\ufb03cial motto is \u201cexploding the teenage underground into passionate revolt\nagainst the corporate ogre since 1982\u201d\n.\nMost think of K as a twee label, but\ntheir sound is summed up accurately by\nBeat Happening themselves: primitive,\nbadly recorded and unpretentious. Riot\ngrrrl pioneers Bikini Kill were signed\nhere, as was Beck, punk rockers Built\nto Spill, he Melvins, and Mount\nEerie. They have plenty of great twee\nbands too, but K is a fascinating collection of lo-\ufb01 DIY pop.\nBands to check out: Beat Happening,\nhe Halo Benders, Talulah Gosh/\nHeavenly, Built to Spill, Tiger Trap.\nFortuna Pop!\nThe powerhouse of London indiepop,\nFortuna Pop have managed to snap up\njust about every half decent band in the\nUK scene within the past 5 years. Sean,\nthe founder, practically went bankrupt\nduring the \ufb01rst decade of their found-ing, until he discovered shoegaze-pop-sters he Pains of Being Pure at Heart\nand actually started making money.\nHe\u2019s hit big again with Allo Darlin\u2019,\nand signed Darren Hayman, more\nfamous as the singer and songwriter\nbehind Hefner. You can still \ufb01nd Sean\nhanding out \ufb02iers at any gig where his\nbands play, a tribute to the dedication\nto his fans.\nBands to check out: The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Darren Hayman,\nAllo Darlin\u2019, Comet Gain, Crystal\nStilts.\nBig Scary Monsters\nBig Scary Monsters Recording Company was the starting point for the vast\nmajority of Britain\u2019s greatest math rock\nartists. Colour, Meet Me in St. Louis,\nand Blak\ufb01sh spent their short careers\non this label, while Tubelord, Tellison,\nand This Town Needs Guns all released their debut here as well. There\u2019s\nmore than just math rock though, with\nYndi Halda, Get Cape. Wear Cape.\nFly, and Pulled Apart by Horses all\nhaving released records through BSM\nas well. Their current roster includes\nTall Ships, Talons and Algernon Cadwallader amongst a host of other exciting bands (and Andrew W.K.).\nBands to check out: Colour, his Town\nNeeds Guns, Mimas, Blak\ufb01sh, Meet\nMe in St. Louis, Tall Ships, Talons,\nTubelord.\nCrydamoure and Roul\u00e9\nFormed individually by Guy-Manuel\nand Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk\nfame, Crydamoure and Roul\u00e9 represented each member\u2019s vision in crafting\na recognisable genre full of fun, frolics\nand fat beatz. Both labels o\ufb00er only a\nsmallselectionofsomeofthemost\ufb01nely crafted club music, but with releases\nsuch as Stardust\u2019s \u201cMusic Sounds Better with You\u201d\n, it\u2019s hard to deny the in\ufb02uence the labels have had on house music today. Many of the artists involved\nwere friends or relatives of the duo, and\neven more of them pseudonyms for the\ncollaborations of Daft Punk themselves.\nWhat results is a treasure trove of singles and EPs; a snapshot of the excitement of French house \ufb01nding its feet.\nTracks to check out: he Eternals \u2013\n\u201cWrath of Zeus\u201d\n, Crydajam \u2013 \u201cPlayground\u201d\n, Together \u2013 \u201cTogether\u201d\n.\nMexican Summer\nThis label from Brooklyn initially focused exclusively on vinyl releases, but\nconformed to the digital era over the\nyears. Its artists encompass an eclectic\nmix of sounds from both coasts, with\ntheir music wandering from Peaking\nLights\u2019 psychedelia to the lo-\ufb01 pop of\nBest Coast and garage rock of The Soft\nPack. The label\u2019s most exciting discovery would without doubt be Quilt,\na Boston band of visual art students\nbeautifully experimenting with harmo-nies, creating sounds of vastness and\nsummer peace.\nBands to check out: Quilt, Peaking\nLights, Tamaryn.\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\nInigo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA pick of some of the best music venues in London\nXOYO\nOne of the newer venues in London,\nXOYO has now been open for two years.\nIt is nestled between towering o\ufb03ce\nblocks close to Old Street Station and\nplays host to the hipsters of Shoreditch.\nCurrently under refurbishment, this intimate yet industrial venue will re-open\nin mid-September, and so will be ready\nfor the new term. One of the standout\nshows coming up is a sold out date for\nNas playing on the 3rd October which\nwill be totally crazy. If anyone has tickets\nto that, \ufb01rst of all I am extremely jealous\nbecause I so desperately want to be in at-tendance, and secondly I would just like\nto say \u2018Enjoy\u2019 in a lightly faux sarcastic,\nenvious way.\nAlexandra Palace\nWords cannot describe how incredibly\ncool the sprawling magni\ufb01cence which\nis the Alexandra Palace, and yet it is my\nduty as a Music Editor to endeavour to\ncomplete such a thankless task. The\n\u2018Ally Pally\u2019 is a beautiful and vast place to\nwatch your favourite band and the glass\nroof is something special indeed. All Tomorrows Parties do a lot of events here,\nwhich makes such a proposition even\nmore appealing. One of my the most\nmemorable moments of last year was\nwatching Bombay Bicycle Club enthral\nthe feverish masses in the Ally Pally and\nthinking \u201cwould I prefer to be anywhere\nelseintheworldrightnow?\u201d\n.Youcan\ufb01nd\nthe answer out for yourself.\nBrixton\nYou know when your favourite band\nheadlines the Brixton Academy that they\nhave made it and are zooming into the\nmainstream. You can stand there at the\nbagofthiscavernousvenue,pintinhand,\ntelling everyone who will listen how you\n\u2018much prefer their \ufb01rst EP\u2019 and how you\n\u2018hate all these new fans because they only\nlike the latest album\u2019; but deep down you\nknow you want to throw yourself into\nthe centre of the crowd and sing along,\narm in arm, to the latest \u2018ooooaaaahhhh\u2019\nof the chorus of the latest Vaccines song.\nYou hypocritical bastard.\nhe Old Blue Last\nMan cannot survive on bread alone, but\nit is widely known that London hipsters\ncan consist purely o\ufb00 of a few cans of\nRed Stripe and frequent visits to the Old\nBlue Last in Shoreditch. The OBL is a\nbar/venue owned by the ever ironic Vice\nmagazine and it is a really great place to\nsee lots of new bands for free upstairs\nmost nights. It is also probably the best\nplace in London to hobnob with the latest cool East London bands, of which it\nseems there is a conveyor-belt of at the\nminute. You could say to your new Imperial friends, \u2018Hey I was totally talking to\nthe lead singer of [he Big Pink/ Spector/he Horrors etc.] and he totally dug\nmy moustache\u2019\n. Unless you are a girl. If\nyou are into this sort of place then will\nalso love the Shacklewell Arms on the\nroad to Dalston\nPlastic People\nIt has been at the forefront of London\u2019s\nunderground dance scene for a number\nof years now and, in my opinion, has yet\nto be surpassed. As you descend into the\nbowls of the club, which is situated just\no\ufb00 Old Street, two things strike you: how\nsmall the club is and also how dark it is,\nneitherofthesethingsshouldputyouo\ufb00.\nInvisible speakers wrap the dance \ufb02oor\nbehindblackmesh,\ufb01llingthesmallspace\nwith perfect sound. This is clubbing at its\nmost intimate, where exciting new DJs\nand producers work their stu\ufb00.\nMadame Jojos\nMadame Jojos is a magical place in the\nheart of Soho in Central London. A fantastic night called White Heat is run every Tuesday night with small indie bands\nand a club night afterwards. It is a great\nplace to see new bands in an intimate en-vironment. In my opinion, White Heat is\nreally good for slacker rock and lo-\ufb01 pop,\nso if plaid shirts and crunching guitars\nare your thing then you are in for a treat.\nThis is also one of the coolest places you\ncan go which is only one night bus from\nsouth Kensington or Hammersmith/Fulham so that is de\ufb01nitely a plus.\nBush Hall\nI\u2019m actually very sad that I didn\u2019t discover\nBush Hall in Shepherd\u2019s Bush sooner.

Freshers\u2019 Fair is where all the Clubs, Societies\n& Projects at Imperial are given a stall to promote their group\u2019s\nactivities and persuade you to get involved.\nOn the day the atmosphere is fantastic as thousands of students\n\ufb02ood campus looking for a group where they can practice their\nhobbies. Stalls are arranged by type so if you\u2019re a fan of the\noutdoors or a keen musician you should be able to \ufb01nd the groups\nassociated with those pursuits all in one area. However, I would\nstrongly advise you to make an effort to visit each area even if you\ndoubt you\u2019ll \ufb01nd anything interesting there; coming to university\nis one of the best times to branch out, and even if you don\u2019t see\nanything of interest at least you\u2019ll pick up a few more freebies!\nWe\u2019re incredibly proud of the diversity and dedication of our\ngroups, allowing students to pursue almost any interest they can\nimagine, so make sure you take full advantage of the breadth of\nactivities we offer during your time here.\nAt Freshers\u2019 Fair we operate a strict no trading policy, so you\nneedn\u2019t worry about having to part with any money on the day.\nInstead the clubs will encourage you to sign up to their mailing\nlists so that you can be kept informed of when they are meeting\nand what they\u2019re up to. Don\u2019t worry about signing up to too many\nas it\u2019s easy to unsubscribe once you\u2019ve decided which groups\nyou\u2019d like to remain involved with \u2013 initially the best idea is to keep\nyour options open.\nOnce you\u2019ve decided which Clubs, Societies or Projects you want\nto join, most require you to pay a membership fee to join. Joining\nthem is easy. Just go to our website; imperialcollegeunion.org.\nMany run free taster sessions to demonstrate their activities. They\nmight seem daunting, but many similarly daring people will be in\nthe same boat and the groups will be familiar with and more than\nwilling to help out newcomers.\nIf you do miss any early gatherings of groups you are interested\nin, don\u2019t worry as you can join a group at any time of the year.\nLikewise, you can sign up to any group\u2019s mailing list whenever you\nlike. Just get in touch via the contact details on\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nEnjoy the Fair and I look forward to meeting many of you on the\nday!\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nPrince Consort Road\nUnion Building\nBBQ\n13\n12\n7\n9\n8\n5\n3\n4\n21 19\n20 18\n14 16\n15 17\n10\n2\nBeitQuadBQ\n11\n1\n4 2\n3 1\n6\n7\n9\n13 11\n12 10\n15\n14\nMetric M\nBeit Quadrangle\nGround Floor\n5\n8\n16 17 18 19\n5 6\n2 4\n3 7 9\n8\n17 15\n16\n18\n19 14 12\n13\n1\n20\nActivitySpaces AS\n11\n10\n14\n10 11 13\n12\n2\n6 5 3\n4\n17\n1\n9\n8\nUnionDiningHallUDH\n7\n15 16\n6\n\n"

    "content": "Basicsly, let\u2019s find the Value of Smartprices\nFirst of all, welcome to uni! Granted,\nyou\u2019ll have moments where money\nis tight and you\u2019ll need to cut a few\ncorners for a bit. For some of you,\nthis means budget grub on certain\ndays/weeks \u2013 but how do you know\nwhat\u2019s worth bagging and what isn\u2019t?\nhe packaging of value ranges like\nSainsbury\u2019s Basics, Tesco Value and\nASDA Smartprice can certainly be\no\ufb00-putting for bargain-hunters; how-ever, we\u2019ve taken the trouble to scour\nthese ranges for some gems well worth\n(more than) what they cost. Here\u2019s to\ncheap and cheerful food!\nRange of the week: Sainsbury\u2019s Basics\nSmoked Salmon Trimmings, 120g \u2013\nprice seasonal, but usually in the range\nof \u00a31 +/- 10-20p.\nhose lovely smoked salmon slices\nyou see in the other Sainsbury\u2019s ranges don\u2019t look that nice right from the\nsmoked \ufb01llet \u2013 they\u2019ve undergone\nsome culinary nip and tuck to look that\nway. he trimmings, however, are still\nperfectly good Scottish smoked salmon (RSPCA Freedom Foods endorsed\neven) \u2013 the exact same as the pricier\nranges, just not presented in the same\nway. Tastes just the same too \u2013 you\nwon\u2019t be making posh hors d\u2019oeuvres\nor bagel sandwiches with this, but it\ngoes well with cream cheese and pasta\nor any recipes that require you to cut\nup the salmon anyway (e.g. kedgeree).\nTry it with scrambled eggs too, you\u2019ll\n\ufb01nd that because it\u2019s so \ufb02avourful\nthere\u2019s no need to add salt.\nVerdict: Quality seafood on a budget.\nSee also: Smoked Mackerel, approximately 250g at 80p/100g \u2013 great in\nsalads, pates or sandwiches. Or, again,\nmake kedgeree!\nCherries, 250g. \u00a31.80 (\u00a37.20/kg)\nJust like the smoked salmon trim-mings, this is decent quality grub at\na deceptive price. I can never justify\npaying exorbitant prices for cherries,\nmost of which end up being not so \ufb01rm\nand also \ufb02avourless (the next range up\nis almost double the price for the same\nweight \u2013 \u00a33.00 for 250g). hese ones\nare a little bit smaller but they\u2019re still\n\ufb01rm and full of \ufb02avour, and not too\ndry either. Perfect for snacking on, or\nfor dessert toppings/ingredients.\nVerdict: I\u2019ve been known to polish o\ufb00\na full 250g punnet in a matter of minutes as after-lunch dessert. You won\u2019t\nbe disappointed.\nAvocado, pack of 4, \u00a31.50\nhey only di\ufb00er from the non-Basics\nvariety in terms of size \u2013 saves your\nthe cumbersome task of trying to\nstore the other half (without it going\nbrown and all) because one half is\nenough; whereas the smaller Basics\navocados are just the right size, even\nfor people with big appetites like my-self. Other than that they\u2019re exactly\nthe same when it comes to quality, so\nuse in guacamole and salads as you\nwould the non-Basics avocados. Being\nsmaller, they\u2019re also the perfect size\nfor snacking; those of you dieters who\nget kittens over that \u201cbecause avocados are fattening\u201d, the fats are the good\nmonounsaturated kind \u2013 so relax. And\nas they say, all things in moderation;\nso these smaller avocados certainly do\nhelp with that!\nVerdict: You know what they say about\ngood things and small(er) packages...\nDigestive Biscuits, 400g, 33p\nNo need for McVities, these things do\nthe job of cuppa companion brilliantly.\nWhether British, European, Asian or\notherwise, the majority of my tea-and-biscuit-loving friends have at least one\npack (if not two) of these stashed in\ntheir cupboards. hey aren\u2019t any more\ninferior in terms of the texture and\ntaste \u2013 I like them, and I\u2019m not exactly the biggest fan of digestives or\nbiscuits in general; but dip these in tea\nto soften and I\u2019m in love. I do end up\nusing them quite a bit in desserts that\nrequire them, though: they\u2019re great in\nti\ufb03n cakes, and become good biscuit\nbases for cheesecakes when bashed\ninto crumbs and mixed with their\nother non-tea companion: (melted)\nBasics Butter.\nVerdict: Your vicar de\ufb01nitely won\u2019t kill\nyou for bringing these to your next\n\u201ctea on the lawn\u201d party.\nSee also: Rich Tea Biscuits (300g,\n23p) and Chocolate Digestive Biscuits (300g, 48p) for alternative cuppa\ncompanions, or Salted/Unsalted Butter (250g, \u00a31.19 for both varieties) for\ncooking and baking.\nMozzarella, 125g ball, 52p\nNote that this is the fresh white kind,\nnot the grated processed yellow stu\ufb00\nthat most pizzas use. Like the avocados they\u2019re not much di\ufb00erent from\ntheir non-Basics counterparts when\nit comes to \ufb02avour and texture, yet\ncost signi\ufb01cantly less: at least half the\nprice! Use as you would fresh mozzarella normally, it\u2019s great for tearing to\nput in salads, or with pasta \u2013 I tend to\nhave to stop myself from tearing and\neating at least half the ball without\nhaving put any mozzarella pieces in\nmy food, much like how most of us\nare when we\u2019re baking/cooking with\nchocolate. Melts pretty decently as\nwell, though I prefer to use it freshly\ntorn in my dish without heating and\nsnack on the leftovers at a later time \u2013\none ball\u2019s big enough for two servings.\nVerdict: Good enough to perhaps satisfy any homesick Italian hallmates.\nAnd for balance, one of the duds:\nBacon \u2013 Middle Bacon Rashers (450g,\n\u00a34.80/kg), Back Bacon Rashers (300g,\n\u00a35.00/kg), Cooking Bacon Rashers\n(670g, \u00a31.48/kg)\nBargain meat/poultry in general is\na dodgy domain because there\u2019s a\nstipulation that you can add a certain\namount of water to meat (10% of its\nweight?) before you have to legally declare it in the ingredients list. Basics\nbacon has water in their ingredients\nlist, so that means that you\u2019ve got at\nleast 10% of water-weight in there.\nhe water shows: my attempt to\ncook the back bacon rashers ended up\nbeing the making of Honey I Shrunk\nhe Kids: Porcine Edition right in my\nkitchen. By the time I was done cooking it, it shrunk so much that I\u2019m not\nsure even the miniscule Lilliputians\nthat Gulliver met during his travels\nwould have been satis\ufb01ed with how\nbig (or little) the pieces ended up be-ing. he taste/texture? It\u2019s what I imagine brittle salty leather would taste\nlike... not a pleasurable addition to my\nfry-up that Sunday. he middle rashers and cooking bacon fared a bit bet-ter: they shrunk less and tasted slightly nicer, but I\u2019d still be a bit wary of it.\nVerdict: Wouldn\u2019t feed the back bacon\nrashers to my dog... well, if I owned\none. Approach other cuts with cau-tion, or, just buy the next range up.\nCarol Ann Cheah Food Editor\nFOOD\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Chea,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEmergency food and hangover cures\nSophia Goldberg Food Editor\nRecipe Corner\nFarfalle with mushrooms and broccoli in a creamy sauce\n(Serves 2)\nIngredients:\n1/2 packet Farfalle pasta (I used homemade beetroot farfalle but any kind is fine)\n300 grams closed cup white mushrooms\n1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme\n2 cloves chopped garlic\n100 ml cream (I use soy cream as it doesn\u2019t overpower the other ingredients like\nnormal double cream)\n200 grams broccoli\n2 tbsp olive oil\nProcedure:\nMake sure you keep the timing right to get the full flavour of each and every\ningredient!\nPut 1 tbsp olive oil in the pan and fry the garlic on low heat. Slice the mushrooms\nand add them to the garlic. Add the thyme\nand pepper, let it cook for half a minute.\nIn a pot put 1 litre of water and when it\nstarts to boil add the pasta and salt. After\n6 minutes add the broccoli. After 1 minute\nremove the pasta and broccoli from the\nwater and add them to the mushrooms.\nAdd the other 1 tbsp of olive oil and place\non low heat. Make sure they mix well and\nafter 1 minute add the cream. Cook for\nhalf a minute and serve. Enjoy!\nYiango Mavrocostanti\nEmergency food!\nStarving with only a few minutes to\ncook and no idea what to eat?\nSpice up your breakfast: Porridge is\nfull of slow-release carbs and is one of\nthe best ways to start the day, but let\u2019s\nbe honest \u2013 it doesn\u2019t taste of much.\nWhy not add some banana, blueber-ries, honey, cinnamon or ready-made\napple pur\u00e9e?\nPosh pasta and pesto: his always\ntastes good in an emergency. To jazz\nit up add some cut up plum and sun-dried tomatoes. Garnish with lots of\npepper and shavings of parmesan.\nSuper quick salad: Grab a carrot,\ncourgette, balsamic vinegar, olive oil,\nraisins, some pecan nuts, and a little\ngoat\u2019s cheese. Here are a few tips on\npurchasing these: it\u2019s worth spending\na bit extra on a good balsamic vin-egar, I like Tesco\u2019s Finest, because it\nmakes such a massive di\ufb00erence to the\nmeal and you will probably only buy\none this academic year; buy a small\namount of crumbly goats cheese from\nthe counter, that way you can just buy\nwhat you need, about 50p\u2019s worth will\ndo. Just grate the carrot and courgette\ninto a bowl, sprinkle over the nuts\nand raisins, and crumble goat\u2019s cheese\nover the top. Add balsamic vinegar\nand olive oil to taste.\nhe best cheese toasty ever: Melted\ncheese is unbelievably tasty. For this\nyou\u2019ll need a few thin slices of Brie\nor Camembert, two slices of bread,\nbutter, one slice of good quality ham\nfrom the counter (try Italian ham\nwith herbs or prosciutto), rosemary\n(ideally fresh and o\ufb00 the stem), and\nseveral fresh spinach leaves. Turn on\nyour toasty maker to warm up. Butter\nthe outsides of the bread, place all the\ngoodies between the unbuttered sides,\nand put it in your toasty maker. Bear\nin mind that if it\u2019s too packed, once it\u2019s\nin the toasty maker, the toasty will ex-plode. Bon appetite!\nHangover cures & places to receive\ntreatment\nIf you can\u2019t leave your bed: drink lots\nof water \u2013 try drinking a hot herbal\ntea. Stick to eating bread and rice. If\nit\u2019s bad get some Dioralyte in you.\nIf you can make it out the house: If\nyou feel like a really amazing fry up,\ntry Pascucci Co\ufb00ee Shop, at 231 Earl\u2019s\nCourt Road, it\u2019ll set you back around\n\u00a35 but you get the works. Also if you\ndon\u2019t like one part of a fry up you can\nask for them to exchange it for something else, so if you hate fried tomatoes you can get more bacon! he coffee is also to die for.\nIf you make it out but it\u2019s well past\nlunch time: I would swear that the spaghetti bolognase at La Pappardella will\ncure you. It\u2019s close to uni at 253 Old\nBrompton Road and it\u2019ll only set you\nback around \u00a38. It\u2019s run by Italians and\nthey have a huge selection of goodies if\nyou\u2019re feeling like something else.\nIf you want a cheap hangover cure\nat home: cook what you like but make\nsure it\u2019s stodgy and not too rich. I\u2019d\navoid rich curries; try something\nmilder like a chicken soup or stew. I\nthink a hai soup is great. If you have\nthe veggies for a stir fry, grab a handful and a diced chicken breast and fry\nthem in a little oil and soya source.\nWhen cooked, chop up a handful of\ncoriander, one lemongrass (optional),\na cube inch of ginger, a mild chilli, and\na couple of garlic cloves and put in the\npan. hen add half a chicken stock\ncube, a couple of pints of water, and\nrice noodles for one. Simmer until the\nnoodles are cooked and you\u2019ll be feeling right as rain in no time.\nFood Editor\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\n12\n\n"

So every\nweek, we will present you with our\ntop \ufb01lms of each decade, and kicking\nthings o\ufb00, we have the 1930s!\n5. Grand Hotel (1932)\nWith a star-studded MGM cast like\nthis (the Barrymores, Greta Garbo,\nJoan Crawford etc.), very little can\nactually go wrong. Set in a luxurious\nhotel where supposedly \u201cnothing ever\nhappens,\u201d the lives, troubles and romantic tangles of various guests and\nsta\ufb00 of the hotel get messy and eventually end in sudden murder. It skilfully links multiple plot strands and\nwildly di\ufb00erent characters together.\nAnd because of this, the 1932 Oscar\nBest Picture winner is considered to\nbe one of the \ufb01rst to handle such hyperlink subgenre with wit, smarts and\nstyle.\n4. The Wizard of Oz (1939)\nIt\u2019s a story that is beloved even to this\nday, so beloved that it has spawned\nvarious spin-o\ufb00s and has an insanely\nloyal following. No-one can belt out a\ntune like Judy Garland, as her Dorothy Gale sings \u201cSomewhere Over the\nRainbow\u201d like no other wannabes,\nand the insanely colourful magical\nland of Oz, further highlighted by\nthe grim and dusty Kansas is a sight\nto behold. The Wicked Witch of the\nWest (Margaret Hamilton) is one of\ncinema\u2019s most memorable villains,\nand the \ufb01lm carries several unforgettable lines that always make it into\nany \u201cbest movie quotes\u201d lists.\n3. The 39 Steps (1935)\nThere are four major \ufb01lm adaptations of the adventure novel The\nThirty-Nine Steps, and this is the\nmost acclaimed one, which is no big\nsurprise, since Alfred Hitchcock\nwas the man behind the camera.\nIn this delightfully fast-paced\ncomic thriller full of twists\nand turns, the story of an\ninnocent but framed man\non the run (a familiar setup for future Hitchcock\n\ufb01lms to come) is a short\nbut gripping ride, with\nsparkling chemistry between the two\nleads. And for those with spare time\nand/or money, make sure to check\nout the equally outstanding West End\nstage play.\n2. It Happened One Night\n(1934)\nSweeping the Big Five awards at the\nAcademy Award (Best Picture, Best\nActor, Best Actress, Best Director\nand Best Screenplay \u2013 a feat that\nhas been achieved only twice more),\nthe Oscar win was the golden\nstart of a glowing, lasting\ncareer of director Frank\nCapra who had already\nachieved success in\nboth the silent and\nsound eras. Claudette Colbert, who\nwas convinced she had\n\ufb01lmed an embarrassing \ufb02op, refused to attend the Oscar ceremony and had to be dragged\nback from her holiday to accept the\naward when she was announced as\nthe deserving winner.\n1. Gone with the Wind (1939)\nFour hours have never felt so short\nand its length is one of the \ufb01lm\u2019s many\nassets, not its downfall, despite what\nthe number of minutes (224) may\nhave you believe. Clark Gable\u2019s Rhett,\nVivien Leigh\u2019s Scarlett, Olivia de\nHavilland\u2019s Melanie, Hattie McDaniel\u2019s Mammy are all remarkable and\ncherished characters, and there are\nno signs of love surrounding this classic dying down. A real highlight of the\nHollywood Golden Age, it presents\nscale that is rarely seen even in modern productions. Don\u2019t agree with the\npick? Frankly my dear, I don\u2019t give a\ndamn.\nThe best films from the 1930s\nJohn Park Film Editor\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\n28\nTop Gun-era Tom Cruise says good\njob!\n\n"

    "content": "Top ten of 2012... so far\n10. 21 Jump Street\nhe long-forgotten Johnny Deppstarring television show got a makeover with the predictably cast Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill playing\ntheir typical roles of the well-built but\ndumb jock and slightly overweight,\nphysically challenged loser respec-tively. But as these two unlikely paired\nup cops receive an undercover assignment to enter a local high school as\nstudents, hilarity ensues as becoming/\nremaining popular inside a teenager\u2019s\nworst nightmare proves to be more\nchallenging than they had initially\nanticipated. Whilst consistently hitting the mark with a great mix of gags\nranging from gross-out to some rather\nself-mocking ones, the \ufb01lm itself is\nalso backed by a good enough plot and\ntwo brilliant leads.\n9. Untouchable\nIt\u2019s a mix of he Help, he Blind Side,\nand thinking further back into cinema\nhistory, Driving Miss Daisy. Although\nthis time, we have a helpful black man\npushing a wealthy white millionaire in\nhis wheelchair on the streets of Paris.\nHe su\ufb00ered a tragic paragliding accident which left him quadriplegic and\nhe hires the fun-looking, pot-smoking\nyoung lad straight out of prison. You\nmay roll your eyes at the many cringe-worthy moments this \u201cbased on a\ntrue story\u201d may have to o\ufb00er, but the\ntwo irresistible lead performances are\nwhat make this generic crowd-pleaser\n(this was a massive hit all over Europe)\nso unique.\n8. Margin Call\nA gripping retelling of the dark and\ndisturbing steps leading up to the 2008\n\ufb01nancial crisis, the magni\ufb01cent cast\nincluding big names such as Kevin\nSpacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore,\nPaul Bettany and Stanley Tucci tackle\nthe comprehensively written script\nwith stern, terri\ufb01c presence. It\u2019s also a\nsurprisingly balanced look at the melt-down, never placing hateful blame or\ntrying to \ufb02are up anger towards the\nbankers themselves, steering away\nfrom condoning or condemning. We\nall paid heavily due to a series of mistakes made by everyone involved, and\nthe sympathetic portrayal by \ufb01rst time\ndirector J. C. Chandor certainly sheds\na human light on such a complex set\nof events.\n7. Carnage\nWhat could be so interesting about\ntwo sets of parents (Jodie Foster,\nJohn C. Reilly, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz) meeting on a quiet New\nYork afternoon to discuss a violent\n\ufb01ght their children were involved in?\nhrow in enclosed space, passive-aggressive remarks, a dead hamster,\nbad pastry, endless phone vibrations,\nvomit, swearing, whiskey and marital problems to the mix and watch\nthe four civilised adults disintegrate\ninto madness under the expert direction of Roman Polanski and you get\none of the most shocking yet hysterical comedies of the year. It\u2019s short,\nsnappy and incredibly sharp in its\nwit and insults \u2013 2012\u2019s underrated\nmust-see.\n6. Brave\nIt\u2019s a rare to sight to see such a\nyoung, self-sufficient and confident\nprincess who wields the bow and arrow instead of occupying her time\nand thoughts with becoming a bride\nto someone she doesn\u2019t even know;\nwhich is a shame, since her mother\ndoesn\u2019t quite share her daughter\u2019s\nviews. Enter the witch who promises to fix everything and instead\nmakes everything worse. Now the\nred-head Scottish princess must\nrace against the clock to break the\nwitch\u2019s spell and restore her kingdom\u2019s peace. With a clear structure,\nfast-paced action and rich in comedy to please both the young and\nold, here is yet another triumph for\nDisney/Pixar.\n5. Lawless\nHere is a gruesome and fascinating\ntale of survivors of the Prohibitionera, and how they took the law and\ncorruption into their own hands for\nthe safety of their loved ones. hree\nBondurant brothers (the superb\nTom Hardy, Jason Clarke and Shia\nLaBeouf) run a reliable bootlegging\nbusiness, supplying much-needed\nalcohol to customers who love them.\nEnter the shady Special Agent Charlie Rakes who decides to stir up trouble with his greed. Out come the\nknuckle dusters and big guns as the\ntwo sides come to a head and violence ensues; the old-school action\nremains as exciting as ever and the\nperformances from its large cast,\nelectrifying.\n4. Moonrise Kingdom\nDirector Wes Anderson can count on a\nfew converts after his quirky yet adorable Cannes-opener. His unique visual\nstyle and eccentric storytelling devices\naren\u2019t exactly a big crowd-pleaser but\nthe irresistible mix of childhood nostalgia and na\u00efvet\u00e9 creates a warm, unforgettable gem. Backed by a strong\n(arguably) \u201csupporting\u201d cast (Bruce\nWillis, Frances McDormand, Edward\nNorton, Billy Murray), the story of a\ncouple of 12-year-olds in love (Kara\nHayward and Jared Gilman, absolutely incredible in their debut perfor-mances) who decide to run away is an\nimpeccable blend of both charm and\no\ufb00-beat, oftentimes shocking humour\nthat can stand proudly alongside Anderson\u2019s best works.\n3. The Cabin in the Woods\nIf you think you\u2019re smart enough or\nhave seen enough horror \ufb01lms to\nknow everything that is going to happen in he Cabin in the Woods, think\nagain. Although the set-up is familiar\n(\ufb01ve young men and women foolishly decide to go on a trip to a creepy,\nabandoned cabin that\u2019s in the middle\nof nowhere), what follows is a dizzying\nescalation of events that brings out the\nlaughs, shocks and scares, building up\nto a sensationally epic \ufb01nale of bloody,\ngory chaos. Well mapped out, creative\nand full of surprises, this is the horror \ufb01lm to beat now when it comes to\noriginality.\n2. Avengers Assemble\nhe mother of superhero \ufb01lms does\nnot disappoint as it pays careful attention to not only delivering exhilarating\naction, but also to its many characters\nfull of \ufb02aws and individual personality quirks. With no-one sidelined and\neveryone given highlight moments\nof their own, the long-awaited, much\nhyped-up Marvel event of the summer got its well-deserved raging success both in terms of the critical and\nthe \ufb01nancial. It was great to see some\nold faces again (Robert Downey Jr.,\nChris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson) and the new additions\n(Mark Ru\ufb00alo, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson) certainly improved\nthe scale and helped create the epic\natmosphere.\n1. Chronicle\nA low-budget superhero \ufb01lm: who\nwould have thought this could actually work? Yes, this is a \u201cfound footage\u201d piece, in a tiresome string of \ufb01lms\ntrying to gain publicity and attention,\nbut everything in Chronicle keeps\nthings fresh and exciting. As three\nteenagers discover they have superpowers after a mysterious encounter\nwith what looks like an extraterrestrial spaceship, they all deal with this\nin their own way, with one of them, a\nloner and a victim of bullying, becoming more and more unstable and addicted to his new-found power. he\nyoung, talented cast gives this a highly\nauthentic look, and the action is,\nwhen necessary, breathtaking. It\u2019s a lot\nmore personal, intimate and at times,\nheart-breaking than any superhero\n\ufb01lm out there, which makes this that\nmuch more special. Proof that money\ncan\u2019t guarantee quality, studio bosses\nshould learn from surprise hit \ufb01lms\nsuch as this one.\n\u201cWe\u2019re number one? Haha, yeah,\nwhatever...\u201d\nJohn Park Film Editor\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\n\n"

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntech.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n@felixtechnology\nTechnically speaking: Fresher tech...\nJason Parmar walks you through what you\u2019ll need this year\nHEADPHONES\nI don\u2019t care about music, I want to look cool\nIf you like colourful headphones that make you feel massively cool/DENCH\nand you like walking around with big headphones around your neck when\nyou\u2019re not using them like a complete douchebag to show everyone \u201clook I listen\nto music\u201d then you need one of the below.\nThe rising standard model for douchebaggery cool are Monsters. Mostly in the form of Dr Dre\nBeats with the iconic red lowercase \u201cb\u201d these headphones are genuinely kind of cool but are insanely\npriced. The Purity\u2019s, as endorsed by Nokia, are another set of badass looking Monsters but again\nyou\u2019ll be paying a huge premium for the great style of these.\nIf you\u2019re really badass and have a get rich or die trying attitude (i.e. you\u2019re going to pack in science\nand become a banker) then the new 50 cent SYNC wireless headphones are for you, and they\u2019ll \u2018only\u2019\nset you back \u00a3300.\nAll these headphones look cool as fuck, but, as any good music boffing will tell you, the value for\nmoney on sound quality is pretty woeful. But who cares, people only wear headphones to look cool\nright?\nUrbanear headphones, sold in Urban Outfitters are the more hipster option. They look super cool\nand the headphone cable doesn\u2019t tangle easily (massive win) but still, overpriced for mediocre sound.\nSkullcandys are the best value for money option in the \u201cI don\u2019t care about music I just want to look\ncool\u201d section. Skullcandy offers lifetime warranty with their headphones and they\u2019re always pumping\nwith bass, and although expensive they don\u2019t come close to the prices of Monsters or SYNC.\nI don\u2019t care about looking cool, I go to Imperial already\nIf you don\u2019t care about looking cool (because you go to Imperial already) there\u2019s\na shit-ton of high quality and good value-for-money headphones for the\nbest sound, custom to your preferences, although they\u2019re not always the\nprettiest of sights. Without reeling off a long list, check out the big\nnames (Sony, Seinheiser, Bose etc) to find your preferred sound, feel\nand price. Bose have a great pair of in-ear headphones that deliver\ngreat bass and sound clarity, without that \u201choly-shit my ear is being\nviolated\u201d feeling that the Beats in-ear ones give you. Perfect for the\nwalk to College, or when you\u2019re on the Tube.\nGeneral software you should all get\nIf you actually want to pass your degree, you best get yourself Microsoft Office: it\u2019s the shit.\nIf not, you can try Open Office, but, in this Tech Editor\u2019s opinion, if you do venture down\nthat path, make sure you get both! Like those before you, Open Office users are likely to\nbe struck by regular frustrations at Imperial\u2019s ingrained use of Microsoft Office. So, for\nthis one, it\u2019s better to be mainstream than hipster, get Office. You know the drill: Word, Excel and\nOutlook are essential for university life, and when it\u2019s only \u00a365 (I strongly recommend not to even\ntry torrenting it for free) who\u2019s complaining \u2013 www.software4students.co.uk, for all your Microsoft\nOffice needs.\nOnline storage and docs\nDuring your time at uni you\u2019ll definitely have occasions when you\u2019ll need to use the cloud and share\ndocuments, pictures etc. It could be to work together on problems, or during a team based project.\nThere are four main services available, iCloud, SkyDrive, Google Drive and DropBox. Chances are\nyou\u2019ll have at least one of these already, but it\u2019s well worth signing up to another one for additional\nspace and compatibility with others. Apple\u2019s iCloud offers 5GB free space as does Google Drive.\nDropBox recently up their free offering to 5GB in a move to match, but Microsoft\u2019s SkyDrive is the\nrunaway winner with a huge 25GB of free space (www.skydrive.live.com).\nAll have desktop integration available for download and the ability to share folders and documents,\nall in their own unique way. Have a test of them all and pick your favourite, they all have their own\npros and cons. But, for Apple users, make the most of iCloud\u2019s excellent integration, and, as Windows\nPhone users will know, SkyDrive automatically stores all camera photos and documents from an Office Phone and has a free browser based Office to edit documents.\nBOOKS VS eBOOKS\nDo you really need to buy all those books for your course?\nThe obvious answers is yes, you should definitely have the books,\nand they\u2019ll help you with your course. The honest answer is no: you\ncan probably torrent them, but that\u2019s not cool to do, especially with\nScience & Engineering stuff.\nThe real question should be if you want to buy them in hardback\nfresh (or second hand) or do you want them in electronic format?\nWhich brings us to the question of real Books vs eBooks. The obvious choice for reading a large bulk of text is a Kindle (or Kobo).\nThe screens are\nincredible and e-ink reads just like\na real book. Plus\nit\u2019s significantly\nlighter, smaller,\nand cheaper.\nWith Amazon having just dropping the price on\nthe Kindle, and releasing the new Kindle Paperlight, it\u2019s a\nsound bet. But, they can be a pain to navigate sometimes,\nso maybe you want to go with iBooks or a tablet, the only\nproblem here being that they\u2019re kind of expensive, unless\nyou use them for lots of other things, they\u2019re harder to read\nfor long periods of time and they\u2019re still not that great at\nnavigation.\nThe final choice is to keep it old school, which is what\nmost people will do. It may be more expensive, but there is\nsomething nice about having a big physical book in front of\nyou and actually turning pages, just don\u2019t expect it to be easy\nto take them to workshops, lectures, or generally carrying\nthese heavy fuckers around.\nHoly shit! Is it\njust me of is Felix\nTech awesome!\nOh, and I can\u2019t\nbelieve I\u2019m reading this text. Why\nam I still continuing to look at this\ntext? I can\u2019t say.\nMusic, TV, and films\nMusic is essential for a great first year at uni, you\u2019ll need some good choons to impress the opposite\nsex when you\u2019re about to bump \u2018n\u2019 grind (and you want to be able to play everything on demand) \u2013 so\nmake sure you either have a DENCH hard-drive of all genres of music, or sign up with Grooveshark (free\nbrowser based streaming www.grooveshark.com) or Spotify (free, or \u00a310 a month premium streaming\nservice for mobile and desktop).\nProductivity. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to be at university for, although we all know it\u2019s productivity\nmixed with 4 years of trying to \u201ccontrol the inner wasteman\u201d that wants to go out every night.\nAlthough you shouldn\u2019t have time to watch films, and entire box sets of Breaking Bad, I guarantee\nyou\u2019ll make time in your first year to chill with some friends and pretend you go to Leeds Met (now, that,\nis a fucking PAR! \u2013 Tim) by sitting in and doing nothing but watch TV/films. If you are going to, it\u2019s best to\nmake sure it\u2019s all legal. So get a subscription to Netflix or Lovefilm (or both if you are a true waster). Both\nof the streaming powerhouses have compatibility with consoles, laptops, tablets, and even SMART TVs.\nBut to be honest, you shouldn\u2019t have time to subscribe to any of these. If you do, take up more Clubs\nand Societies. Or, you could consider taking some time out to write for a great Tech section of a student\nnewspaper. Hint hint.\nImperial\nNow that the majority of you have moved into halls you\u2019ve probably connected to the internet and\nsampled some of the best broadband in the country. One piece of advice though, grab an Ethernet cable,\nconnect, and visit www.speedtest.net. Although not truly accurate, it makes for pleasant viewing as you\nwatch your speeds soar to INSANE LEVELS OF INTERNET.\nWith internet speeds this fast at Imperial, it makes online data transfer incredibly fast and streaming\ntruly gone forever, which makes watching those HD naughty films all so much better \u2013 thank you Imperial ICT. (Please don\u2019t ever let me touch your laptop \u2013 Tim)\nConnect your phone to Imperial exchange.\nI strongly recommend that you sync your new e-mail account (and calendar) with your\nphone, as this is how you\u2019ll mostly be contacted throughout the year.\nSOFTWARE AND IMPERIAL PROCRASTINATION STATION\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\n32\n\n"

    "content": "What\u2019s on in London?\nEva Rosenthal guides you round the culture of the Big Smoke\nhat\u2019s on in London? Everything\nis what\u2019s on in\nLondon! Of\ncourse, the truth\nis you\u2019ll get caught up in Freshers\u2019\nWeek stu\ufb00 and (whether you believe\nit or not) the famous Imperial workload that you\u2019ve probably heard about.\nBut you\u2019re in London; this is one of\nthe greatest cultural cities in the world\nand a\ufb00ords many, many opportunities\nfor labouring on your artsy creden-tials. Below I give just a few recommendations so that the busy Imperial student doesn\u2019t leave London after\n\ufb01rst year only being able to talk of the\nwonders of student priced drinks at\nthe Union.\n1. The Donmar Warehouse\nhis playhouse is world-renowned\nfor having produced absolute gems\nof theatre. It holds only 250 seats and\ndue to its miniature size, one always\nfeels as though one were involved in\nthe action. One of the great advantages here are the prices, with tickets\nstarting at \u00a310.\n2. The Royal Opera House\nFor less than the price of a large bottle of vodka at Essentials, you can \ufb01nd\nyourself attending the opera at Covent Garden. I would say that this is\na pretty good excuse to ignore those\ncalling you a snob and try the pleasures of an evening of opera. here is\none small hitch: you will probably\nnot have booked in advance, and will\ntherefore need to get up at around 6\nin the morning in order to queue until\n10am for one of these cheap seats. I\nstill say it is entirely worth it.\n3.LeonardodaVinci:Anatomist\nIf you were in London last year, perhaps you remember the hype created\nby the Leonardo da Vinci show, which\nwas on at the National Gallery. Tickets\nwere prized possessions, to be shown\no\ufb00 by their owners as if they also\ngained one entry to the 100m Olympic\n\ufb01nal. Not so for this da Vinci exhibi-tion, in which his exquisite anatomical drawings, of interest due to their\nscienti\ufb01c accuracy and artistry alike,\nare displayed. Taking place at the\nQueen\u2019s Galleries, it also gives you a\nchance to escape watching the dreaded changing of the guard should you\n\ufb01nd yourself near Buckingham Palace\nat around 11am.\n4. Second Hand Books\nJust o\ufb00 the Charing Cross Road, near\nTrafalgar Square, is the Dickensian\nalleyway Cecil Court, where you can\n\ufb01nd an astonishing number of second\nhand and rare bookshops. If nothing\ncould make you happier than \ufb01nding\na \ufb01rst edition of an obscure Nabokov novel for 15 quid, then this is the\nstreet for you.\nFor more on books: head on over to\nthe Books section, where you\u2019ll \ufb01nd a\nguide to the best book stores in London.\n5. BFI Southbank\nClassics, foreign \ufb01lms, and festival\nwinners are on show at the British\nFilm Institute\u2019s headquarters at the\nSouthbank. Until mid October, their\nAlfred Hitchcock retrospective displays the classiest of nail biting \ufb01lms.\n6. Galleries in Bond Street\nImperial students have occasionally\ndeveloped the inability to make it to\nEast London, where, for the time be-ing, most of the contemporary art\nscene is to be found. his is somewhat\nunderstandable. East London is a 25\nminute tube ride away from polished\nSouth Ken. So, for those of you lazy\nbums who can\u2019t make it, there is always Piccadilly and the surrounding\narea. White Cube, Gagosian, Hauser\n& Wirth, Hannah Barry: the possibility to see some of the most important\ncontemporary artists is very close by\nand completely free.\n7. The Serpentine\nYou have absolutely no excuse not to\ngo to the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde\nPark. At most, it is a ten minute walk\naway from the South Kensington campus and almost always has something\nworth seeing. Until the 14th of October, you could take a lunch break away\nfrom the eyesores that are some of\nthose 60s buildings to visit the summer pavilion designed by controversial Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.\n8. Soho Theatre\nA lovely and relatively new theatre in\nthe heart of Soho, putting on modern\nand alternative theatre. he prices are\nagain very student friendly. One of my\nfavourite things about it, apart from\nthe quality of the shows of course, is\nthe bar, where you can go for a quick\npost-show pint or cocktail (I can\u2019t help\nbut recommend the Soho Speakeasy\nhere) and perhaps meet some of the\nvery \u2018un-Imperial\u2019 people who are\nhaving a drink.\nW\nIt\u2019s not your fault. You always liked\nscience. You read \u201cNew Scientist\u201d and\nwatched Horizon as a kid and somehow the path to Imperial seemed so\nclear. Now you realise there is a prob-lem. Maybe you mentioned the soldering iron in your bedroom to that\npretty girl at the bar and died a little\ninside as her eyes glazed over. Maybe\nthe cute boy next door stopped talking to you because you did not understand the David Lynch \ufb01lm he showed\nyou. It\u2019s time for action. We all know\nyou will never be truly arty, so it is\ntime to fake it.\nWe\u2019ll start with the most important\npoint, dressing right. In no particular order, you will need: skinny jeans,\nlarge earrings, scarlet lipstick, ironic\nleopard print, a novelty pendant that\nlooks like a robot, a Christmas jumper,\nand obviously some oversized glasses.\nIf you think some of that is not appropriate for your gender, you are wrong,\nwear it anyway. Oh, and dye your hair\na stupid colour or grow a moustache.\nNext you need to act right. Try to\nget invited to private viewings but on\nno account look at the art: that will\nimmediately mark you out as a fraud.\nInstead, take full advantage of the free\nbeer and talk about how messed up\nyour life is. Buy a Moleskine notebook and\nwhip it out to do a quick\nsketch at inappropriate\nmoments. If you have\nan iPad, use that in-stead. If anyone asks, say\nthat Hockney did it \ufb01rst.\nDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t\nknow who that is, Wikipedia\ncan be your friend.\nFinally you will need to\ntalk right. his is the hard\none. You should give the\nimpression that you\nhave a vague notion\nof art history. his is\nnot as hard as it sounds\nbecause enthusiasm is frowned upon\nin the art world. If anyone engages you\nin conversation you can act bored and\nchange the subject. It is actually fairly\nsimple. Impressionism is kind\nof blur- ry and\nfauvism\nis even\nw o r s e .\nDadaism is\nthe random\nshit and surrealism is the\ntrippy shit. Pop\nArt is cans of soup\nand conceptual\nart is largely un-m a d e\nbeds and piles of elephant dung.\nLearn the names of three obscure\nartists that no-one has ever heard of\nand look shocked when people proclaim ignorance. I would recommend\nlooking through the Saatchi gallery\ncatalogue and picking two at random.\nGet the third from a tumblr.\nIf you get all this right you will be a\nmore irritating and morally repugnant\nperson, but with any luck you will\nat least get a buzz from the unjusti\ufb01ed sense of superiority. Maybe, just\nmaybe, the gorgeous, kooky kids from\nGoldsmiths will let you join in their\ncocaine fuelled sex parties that you assume they are having 24-7, but probably not.\nWhen I drew a dick over a friend\u2019s\nbook in school I got told off, but\nwhen old Leo scrawls out a wang\nit\u2019s \u201cart\u201d. Whatever.\nA three point plan to bluffing artiness\nMeredith Thomas Arts Editor\nARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNIETZSCHE\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\n24\n\n"

As\nin the original, you\u2019ll take control\nof one of four (new) characters, all\nwith unique abilities and preferred\nweapon types. Set years after Borderlands, the villanous Handsome\nJack has taken control of the planet\nand wants to remove all undesirable\nlife from it, making some money in the\nprocess. Unluckily for everyone, you\u2019re undesirable, but\nyou also don\u2019t take kindly to being threatened with death.\nExpect hilarious co-op fun. Lots of it.

Black Ops\n2 (by the same studio as CoD: Black Ops and CoD: World\nat War) has gone where no CoD has gone before - the fu-ture. Not that far into the future mind you, so there\u2019s still\nbullets (and probably throwing knifes) flying everywhere -no lasers yet. I wouldn\u2019t expect too much that would shake\nthe gaming world to it\u2019s foundations, but expect some solid\ngameplay and the regular adrenaline-pumping multiplayer.\n13 November \u2013 PC, PS3 , Wii U & XBox360\nAs you can see there\u2019s a lot to sink your teeth into this term \u2013\nand there\u2019s a lot more to come. With new hardware such as\nthe WiiU, and the blurring of the console/PC frontlines with\nValve\u2019s Big Picture, we are in for one hell of a ride. That being said, this is not just a burst of energy for the mainstream\nmarkets; with the recent release of\nthe IndieFort Bundle, the continuous growth and incorporation of\nsmaller developers into services like\nSteam, and the prolific Kickstarter\npromising the fulfilment of wishes\nfaster than a hyper Robin Williams, everyone\u2019s catered for.\nSo, welcome ye Fresher\u2019s and familiar faces.

    "content": "r marks this term\nn will be for the l33tprofreshers out there\nGAMES\nDayZ Diaries\nDay One\nI can\u2019t remember my life from before the Fall. My earliest memory is of waking\nup on the coast, my clothing sodden through (with rain, sweat or seawater I still\ndon\u2019t know) and my pockets empty apart from a can of coke, a beaten-up torch\nand some odds and ends.\nThe beach around me was void - of life, of colour, of tracks. Surrounded only\nby the howling winds and darkening skies, I made my way along the rocky coast,\nhoping to find something. Anything.\nI walked with the coast to my left and the trees to the right, and it wasn\u2019t long\ntill I saw signs of life. A small cluster of houses, bins full and rotten and doors shut\ntight was not exactly the welcome I was looking for. I knocked and shouted but\nno-one inside heard me. No footsteps, no peeking from behind the curtains. Actually, I\u2019d like to change my earlier statement. Those houses were not a sign of life.\nThey were a sign of death. I was feeling uneasy and I wanted to get out of there as\nsoon as possible. There was a small road that lead from those houses and it moved\nfurther inland. I thought I\u2019d surely come across somewhere dry and safe, so I made\nmy way onto the main road, and kept on walking.\nThis is when I saw them. I first thought they were scarecrows, standing there in\nthe middle of the road and swaying when the wind changed its course. I paid no\nattention to them, but it wasn\u2019t till I got closer that I noticed the grey and pallid\nfaces of these mannequins were torn and weeping. I ran.\nThat probably wasn\u2019t the brightest idea, as I then found myself being chased\nby three of those bodies. Those limping, wheezing, coughing bodies. I ran further\ninland and saw a small farm up ahead. I took a sharp turn behind a wall, and the unholy chorus behind me stopped, as if they reached the end of their infernal hymn,\nas soon as I was out of sight.\nI kept close to the wall as I slid along to the barn doors. They were wide open.\nThe barn sounded free of those poorly-stringed puppets, and I walked inside. The\nsmell of farmyard life was strong. At least it was dry. I moved up the steps to the\ntop section of the barn, hoping to move some bales around and make somewhere\nto rest. I found a rather blunt wood axe under a bale and tied it onto my belt, hoping that I\u2019d be able to find some suitable trees for firewood.\nI then heard footsteps outside, so I hit the deck and crawled further behind my\nbales. The grunting and laboured breathing got closer until I saw a leg. I swung out\nwith the axe, hitting the leg in the middle of the shin and the body fell, bleeding.\nI heard the snap. I struck out a couple of more times, until I heard it cry \u201cStop.\nStop! I\u2019ll give you whatever you want!\u201d. I picked myself up off the dusty boards\nand walked towards the toppled man, bloody hatchet in hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re dead, I\ncan have everything.\u201d I swung down with the axe, the apparently blunt blade stuck\nfirmly in between his eyes. I rooted through his pockets and bag, finding a can of\nbeans, some matches and this journal. This leather-bound journal, with a birthday\nmessage from his parents. His belongings in my bag, I stood on his brow, pried the\naxe from his forehead and kicked his body, off down to the barn floor.\nThis is the journal of amnesiac Felix de Milo . I\u2019m trapped in a world of thoughtless monsters, and I need to find a way out. Maybe I can remember my life before\nthis storm began. Maybe I just don\u2019t want to.\n\u201cDear xXxl33tKilL4xXx,\nKnow we will always love you.\nBest of luck for your future,\nLove,\nYoMomma69 and whos_your_D4DDY\nxxx\u201d\nAs found on the floor by Ross Webster\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBack to Karkand and Close Quarcusesonvehicularwarfare,bring-cks, upgrades, and a slew of new\nmquad-bikestomobileartillery.I\ne massive AC-130 gunship at this\nrying to run someone over with\nand ram some tanks) as it\u2019s sadly\nnew maps, including a night-time\nerthanTehranHighway),asnow-h is apparently the largest in Bato don\u2019t forget your keys.

    "content": "Loved every minute of it\nWelcome to Imperial freshers!\nOver the next few weeks you will\nhave lots of societies throwing o\ufb00ers at you to sign up,\nand you will probably be sifting through all those dates\nand \ufb02iers wondering which\nclubs are for you and which\nevents you should go to.\nI\u2019m here to make that decision all the more simpler and\ntell you about the experience I\nhad this summer in Kenya as part\nof Imperial KOP Summer Team\n2012!\niKOP (as we are more a\ufb00ectionately known) has been a society at\nImperial since 2010. Our Summer\nTeam has grown since then from seven members in our \ufb01rst year to eleven\nlast summer, and this year there were\n\ufb01fteen students travelling to Kenya\nfrom Imperial alone!\nSince we began we have raised over\n\u00a330,000 to help fund projects, which\nprovide healthcare, a regular source of\nfood, and schooling for orphans and\nvulnerable children in Kisumu, Kenya.\nAlthough each summer a group of\nstudents travel for two weeks to volunteer with our projects, throughout\nthe year there are various socials and\nfundraising activities that everyone\ncan get involved in!\nWe\u2019ve spent the past year getting\nup to all kinds of mischief: Disney\nthemed bucket collects around South\nKensington, dressing up as cupids and\ndelivering roses in lecture theatres\non Valentine\u2019s day, singing Christmas\ncarols to the public and selling Krispy\nKremes and other treats at shows held\nby ICSM Drama and IC Gospel choir.\nOne collect saw me walking out of\nSAF in a rabbit onesie to the amusement of my friends.\nI had always taken an active part in\nKOP activities, helping out since \ufb01rst\nyear, but this year was my chance to\njoin the team and experience \ufb01rsthand the developments our fundraising e\ufb00orts had helped to create!\nArriving into busy Jomo Kenyatta\nAirport in Nairobi after an eight hour\n\ufb02ight, we faced a long bumpy coach\nride to our home for the next two\nweeks, he Duke Of Breeze Hotel in\nKisumu.\nOn our \ufb01rst day in Kisumu we were\ngiven our Kenyan names. I became\n\u2018Denise Achieng\u2019 and every time we\nused our new names we were greeted\nwith kind laughter. here were several\nmore introductions to come as we visited the o\ufb03ces of all the local project\npartners\nand by the end of\nthe greetings we felt very welcome in Kenya indeed.\nOur \ufb01rst project, Kochogo Feeding\nCentre, was built and funded solely\nby KOP students! he centre provides\nlunch and dinner for 180 boys and\ngirls every day! hey have a policy of\nnever turning anyone away, so as well\nas the local school kids they also provided food for some of the elders in\nthe community. With only 3 cooks at\nthe centre, there was plenty to help\nout with in the cooking, farming, and\nshelling peas department. And once\nthe children had arrived from the local\nschools and were fed, we could start\nplaying games!\nhey loved sweets, being lifted up,\nplaying drip drip drop (a take on duck\nduck goose but with water instead),\nblowing bubbles, hiding under the\nmulti-coloured parachute, and dancing to the music blaring out of our ma-tatu truck.\nMurals painted by past KOP students decorated every wall of the feeding centre. hey served to educate the\nchildren as they ate, on the names of\nthe continents, animals and the importance of hand washing amongst\nother things. We later added to these\nour own murals: parts of a \ufb02ower and\nplanets of the solar system (typical Imperial students), what can I say we love\nscience!\nOne afternoon, we visited a local\nschool and gave lessons about HIV/\nAIDS to students from as young as 9\nand right up to 18 years. hey were\nvery intelligent and already knew a\nlot about the disease, but one of the\nthings that was most satisfying was\ngetting the chance to address some of\nthe misplaced stigma surrounding its\ntransmission.\nAfter spending one week\nthere, it was time for us to leave\n(but only for a short while) and\nchange over to our second\nproject at Pal Omega.\nA community of women\nwidowed by AIDS had\ncome together to create\nthe school and a support\ngroup for local families\na\ufb00ected by the disease.\nAs soon as we entered\nthe classroom, the children greeted us with\nbeaming faces and a\nshrill sing song of all\nthe nursery rhymes they knew.\nhey sang for us at the start of every\nday, and it was lovely to hear them\nadd to their song list the new nursery\nrhymes that we had taught\nthem, so\nthat by the\nend of our\nstay, the\ndaily recital had\ng r o w n\ni n t o\na full\nperformance\no f\nK e n -y a n /\nWestern tunes.\nI found my time at Pal Omega\ninspiring, the dedication expressed\nby the group for each other and their\ncause was apparent and I was grateful to be able to sit in on one of their\nmeetings and hear their personal accounts of life with HIV/AIDS and to\nvisit the homes of their members,\nsome of whom were the mothers of\nchildren we had met earlier in the day\nat the school.\nOur last day of projects saw us return to Kochogo for a big party with\nall the kids and project partners. It was\na time for dancing and celebration! A\nchance for us all to say our \ufb01nal goodbyes to all the children.\nAll in all, we were able to visit 4 of\nthe projects supported by KOP: Kochogo Feeding Centre, Pal Omega\nPrimary School, St Anne\u2019s Nursery\nSchool, and HOVIC (Hope for Victoria\u2019s Children).\nOur trip also provided us with ample\nopportunity to explore the beautiful\nscenery and culture that Kenya is well\nknown for. We drank the local beer\n(Tusker), listened to the local music\n(Reggae??), went to the local clubs,\nand ate staple meals prepared by the\nlocals (Ugali and chapatti\u2019s= mmm de-licious).\nWe took boat rides onto Lake Victoria to see the hippos pop their heads\nfrom out of the water and stood ashore\nto watch the last rays of sun before\nsunset.\nSeveral trips to the local Masaai\nmarket left us laden with goodies, feeling smug that we had at least tried to\nbargain for our trinkets, expecting full\nwell to pay higher than normal price,\nbut knowing it was going to bene\ufb01t the\nlocal community nonetheless.\nAnd although our trip to the equator line was overshadowed by rain\nand umbrellas, our trek up the rocks\nof Kit Mikayi onto the summit made\nup for it. he view was\nspectacular and\nwe had another\nchance to watch\nthe sun come\ndown on Kisumu.\nI really miss my\ntime in Kenya;\nboth the people I\nhad the opportunity\nto share that experience with and the\nlocal Kenyans that I\ngot to meet but most\nof all I will miss the\nchildren and the fun\nt i m e s that were had driving\nthe roads of Kenya with reggae music\npounding from our matatus!\nIf you are interested in \ufb01nding out\nmore about the student programme,\nImperial KOP will be having an \u2018Eat\nand Greet\u2019 on 18th October in the\nHuxley Building, Room 144. here\nwill be a representative from the main\nKOP charity as well as free dominos\npizza! We look forward to seeing you\nthere!\nWe will also be holding an iKOP Safari Bar Night in the Union on Friday\n19th October.\nFor more info please email cag-kop@imperial.ac.uk or join our Facebook page \u2018Imperial KOP\u2019.\nDenise Osei-Kuffour is Imperial KOP\nPresident 2012-2013.\nWith special thanks to the members\nof Livperial KOP Summer Team 2012\nwho provided photos\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFRIDAY 28 SEPTEMBER\nDenise Osei-KuffourintroducesyoutoiKOP\u2019ssummer\n\n"

Don\u2019t believe the stereotype,\ncome along and see how much fun it is!\nCaptain: Yas Edwards\nContact: ye210@imperial.ac.uk\nRugby (Mens)\nICURFC have three teams competing in the BUCS league with the 1st\nrecently promoted to Premiership B\nSouth. Two teams will also be competing in the newly formed LUSL weekend\nleague. The club caters for all abilities\nwith training taking place at Lingford\nChristie stadium every Monday and\nFriday evening.\nCaptain: Thomas Hansen\nTrials: Trials take place on the \ufb01rst\nWednesday of term at Harlington. A\ncoach will leave Beit in the late morning and trials will last for a few hours\nfollowed by a fun \ufb01lled evening in the\nUnion.\nEvent: The \ufb01rst big event will be the\nFresher Tour to Cardi\ufb00. This will take\nplace over the second weekend of term\nImperial maul MIT, well, and ruck them...\nDay 3 of the ICURFC Summer USA\n2012 tour saw us face our \ufb01rst oppo-nents, MIT, in a closely fought \ufb01xture\nplayed at Briggs Field on the MIT\ncampus. Despite some hangovers and\nthe rock hard surface, the team arrived at the facilities (read portaloo)\nin high spirits an hour before the 1pm\nKO and just as the sun was getting to\nfull strength.\nHertog set the tone for a scrappy\n\ufb01rst 25 minutes with a scu\ufb00ed kick\no\ufb00 that barely made the ten. Fielded\nby MIT, the home side pushed forward and camped in the IC half for\nthe \ufb01rst ten minutes. Overcoming this\ninitial shock, Imperial started play-ing, and the remainder of the \ufb01rst half\nwas spent in the MIT half. Approaching the 20 minute mark, Imperial \ufb01nally converted their pressure and got\nover with a series of trademark rolling mauls from a lineout; L\u2019Bour the\nscorer, 5-0 Imperial.\nScrappiness coupled with \u201ctour\n\ufb02air\u201d led to several missed chances\nfrom the touring side. However, with\nHardisty and L\u2019Bour clearly bene\ufb01ting\nfrom the summers conditioning program with some strong carries and\nwith Fraser directing things from 9,\nthings were certainly improving. Hertog hacked on an IC clearance kick\nbefore gathering and scoring under\nthe post.\nMIT\u2019s \ufb01st points of the game came\nfrom clean quick ball o\ufb00 the top of the\nlineout and lead by their Irish at import at 10, led to MIT\u2019s \ufb01rst points of\nthe game.\nIC set piece was solid throughout\nthe game a particular highlight being captain Jackson, whose performance was admirable throughout. A\nhard line run by Hertog o\ufb00 a DSP and\na good support line run by the fresh\nCox lead to Imperial\u2019s third try. Veteran IC hooker Coutts earned TotM for\nrepeatedly referring to the IC defensive lineout by its regular name \u201cTwin\nTowers\u201d instead of the tour committee approved \u201cJack and Jill\u201d. MIT\u2019s\nstrong running continued and although plagued with handling errors\nthe home side strung together several\nquick mauls and scored through their\nprop from short range making it 19-12 to IC.\nAlthough dehydration set in due to\nthe scorching heat, a diminished water supply and last nights festivities,\nImperial College were now into their\nstride. Training pitch rugby from a\nlineout in sent Hansen crashing over\nfrom close range to make it 24-12.\nThe MIT counter, with some tired\ndefensive work, lead to another score\nand pushed the home side to within\ntouching distance of winning.\nIC weathered another hard attack\nand countered, the last points coming from a penalty try from Hertog.\nCaught hard on his way down the incident certainly didn\u2019t mar what was\nan excellent blow out for both teams\nand a great way to start the tour with\na 31-19 victory.\nWithout changing facilities, blue\ntour blazers were donned without\nshowers and the squad made their\nway to a BBQ hosted by the gracious\nMIT team. We then progressed to an\nIrish themed bar were songs and stories were exchanged untill late. Particular highlights were Gri\ufb03ths bringing home the boat race in spectacular\nfashion and the incredibly talented\nfreshers choir. A thoroughly enjoyable day, IC look forward to welcome\nthe MIT team to London in Spring\n2013 where they can only hope to\nmatch the level of hospitality shown\nto them in Boston.\nThe Tour Continues.\nJon Hardisty Sports Writer\nImperial 1st XV 31 \u2013 19MIT 1st XV\nMedics\nAthletics\nHave you been inspired by the Olympics?

You\nwill soon realise that in order to remain sane around here, you need to\nbalance work with frequent relaxation\nbreaks. And what better way to relax\nthan by watching the newest episode\nof your favourite show?\nTake this summer for example: while\nmost of you were lounging around or\ntravelling abroad and generally being\nmerry, I was \ufb01nishing o\ufb00 my postgrad\nhere at Imperial and writing my thesis.\nWhenever writer\u2019s block (or a bout of\nsheer laziness) hit me, I turned to my\ndear friend the internet to watch some\nseries to take my mind o\ufb00 things.\nhe summer began with the last\nfew episodes of the second season\nof Game of hrones. While not quite\nliving up to the standards of its \ufb01rst\nseason, the televised version of the\nsecond instalment of George R. R.\nMartin\u2019s epic A Song of Ice and Fire\nbrought with it dozens of new char-acters, relationships, betrayals, and\nbattles, making it a bit di\ufb03cult to keep\ntrack of everything. hat being said,\nthe show is still excellent and the acting is top-notch.\nhe second season of he Glee Project (yes, I\u2019m a Gleek and proud of it!)\nproved to be just as entertaining as the\n\ufb01rst, with the contestants only slightly\nless annoying than last year. I\u2019m not\nsure I completely agree with who was\nchosen as the winner, but I\u2019m still curious what kind of character this person will portray on Glee.\nSpeaking of musical, is anyone\nelse watching Smash? It was recommended to me by a friend just as I was\nstarting with my thesis write-up, and\nproved to be an addictive distraction\nfrom work. Starring Debra Messing\n(Will & Grace) and Jack Davenport\n(Pirates of the Caribbean), the show\nrevolves around the creation of a new\nBroadway musical about the life of\nMarilyn Monroe. Unlike in Glee, the\ncharacters don\u2019t spontaneously burst\ninto song, as each musical number is\na performance, which makes it more\nbelievable. Filming of the second season has started and will feature the\ntalents of Jennifer Hudson; it\u2019s due to\nair in the States in January.\nFollowing a slightly disappointing\nand chaotic season, True Blood returned for a \ufb01fth year full of vampires,\nshifters, blood, sex and gore. his year\nthe main focus was on he Authority\n\u2013 the vampire governing body, who\nalso turned out to be a bunch of religious zealots. he return of Denis\nO\u2019Hare as Russel Edgington was great,\nand with Alan Ball stepping down as\nshow-runner it will be interesting to\nsee what direction the show will take\nwhen it returns next summer.\nFinally, White Collar is another\nshow that was recently brought to\nmy attention. I\u2019ve only seen the \ufb01rst\ntwo episodes so far, but I\u2019m already\nhooked. he show stars Matt Bomer\nas con-man Neal Ca\ufb00rey who escapes\nfrom a maximum security prison and\nsubsequently starts aiding the FBI as\npart of a work release program. I will\nde\ufb01nitely be returning to this after I\u2019ve\nhanded it my thesis \u2013 I have four seasons to catch up on!\nDid you watch anything interesting\nthis summer? he new Doctor Who\nperhaps?

    "content": "Trying to beat those pesky h\nPhilippa Skett is relatively sure that this is probably impossible, but w\ns you are reading this\narticle, I can guess you\nare either rallying yourself up to go and awkwardly introduce yourself to your hall mates, or are slumped\nin a mid-morning hangover that just\nwon\u2019t budge. As young adults faced\nwith the trials and tribulations of\nsmall talk throughout Freshers\u2019 Week,\nalcohol seems the closest friend you\nmay make all week. So spend some\ntime here acquainting yourself with\nthe science side to drinking, alongside what to expect the morning after.\nIt might even provide you with some\nwelcome ice breakers for he Mingle,\ninstead of asking for the umpteenth\ntime what A-levels your new companion did.\nIt is actually one of science\u2019s little secrets that we are still unsure as\nto what a hangover actually is. No\none doubts a hangover is real; it is\nextremely di\ufb03cult to de\ufb01ne it as a\nmyth when you are hugging the toi-let, begging for a quick death to save\nyou from the never ending pain. It has\nbeen classi\ufb01ed as the bunch of symptoms following moderate alcohol con-sumption; headaches, nausea, fatigue,\nanorexia, depression and, although\nnot really physical, a sense of shame\nand self-hate (depending on how long\nyou let yourself stay in Metric). However, what causes these? And, more\nimportantly, can they be reversed, or\navoided altogether?\nhe hangover is a complex manifestation that is not entirely dose\ndependent; it can be altered by food\nconsumption, physical exertion during intoxication, sleep quantity and\nquality, or even gender and age. Studies present a plethora of data concerning hangover severity parallel to\ncertain \u201ccures\u201d administered prior,\nduring, or after drinking, but these\nseem inconclusive.\nSo what contributes to the morning pain? he hangover is the direct\ne\ufb00ect of alcohol on the body, and the\ne\ufb00ect of the compounds produced\nonce it is metabolised. It directly irritates the gastronomical tract, leading\nto vomiting, and it also stimulates a\nhigher rate of production of intestinal\nand pancreatic secretions, leading to\nstomach pain and nausea.\nAlcohol is also a diuretic, meaning\nit naturally increases urinary output\n(leading to the infamous landmark of\na night out, the Breaking of the Seal),\nwhich results in dehydration. his in\nturn causes the common thirst, dry\nmouth, and dizziness felt the morning after, which is not helped by an\nincrease in sweating and vomiting\nduring elevated inebriation. Drinking a lot of water alongside alcohol\ncan remedy this to some extent, but\nit may not stay down if the stomach\nis particularly sensitive after alcohol\nexposure.\nhe hangover headache, a trademark of a night out, is caused by vaso-dilation in the brain during drink-ing, to the point where the brain has\nswelled slightly and is pressing against\nthe skull. his can be prevented somewhat by taking that aspirin before you\ngo to bed and before the headache\nkicks in, to slow down in\ufb02ammation.\nParacetamol is really a no-no: it is me-tabolised by the liver, which is already\nunder a lot of pressure. Sometimes,\nit may be better just to wait it out \u2013\nno pain no gain, right? he ultimate\nhangover cure is time \u2013 just snuggle\ndown, sit tight, and wait for the storm\nto pass.\nhe hangover can also be skewered\nby the presence of other biologically active compounds in the drink\nbesides alcohol, called congeners,\nwhich worsen a hangover further. he\ndarker the drink, the more congeners\npresent, and the more you might regret it in the morning. Avoid whiskey,\nred wine and brandy, and stick to the\ncolourless stu\ufb00. Still feeling rough?\nEat foods that are high in fructose\nand complex carbohydrates to reverse\nlow blood sugar levels caused by the\nmetabolic response of the liver to al-cohol. A build-up of lactic acid, a side\ne\ufb00ect of alcohol metabolism, can inhibit glucose production and lead to\nmore headaches and fatigue, as the\nbrain can only run on glucose. Eating\nsome toast or fruit can help shake o\ufb00\nthat hangover \u2013 if you can stomach it.\nDrinking therefore sets o\ufb00 a chain\nreaction of disruptions throughout\nthe body, that come together to contribute to the pain of the morning af-ter. But it doesn\u2019t end here, as there\nis still a lot left to discover in terms\nof hangovers and possible cure. So,\nas you are also about to embark upon\nthe path to educational nirvana, you\nshould consider researching the ultimate hangover cure along the way.\nYou have a good three to four years to\nperfect it, and it makes a great excuse\nfor trying those paint stripper-based\ndrinks at Cheapskates on a Wednesday. And you never know, you might\neven have fun along the way.\nA\nhe active component of alcoholic\ndrinks, as any Imperial student worth\ntheir salt could tell you, is ethanol, a\n2-carbon alcohol. he e\ufb00ects of etha-nol, intoxication, i.e. being drunk,\nincluding euphoria, reduced social\ninhibition, loss of coordination, word\nslurring, and drunk texting your old\nex \u2013 should be familiar to anyone\nwho\u2019s touched the demon drink. How,\nthough, does ethanol exert its e\ufb00ect\non the human body?\nEthanol is water soluble, and is absorbed into the bloodstream through\nthe stomach and the small intestines\nbefore proceeding to the liver, whereupon it is metabolised in a two-step\nprocess. Ethanol is \ufb01rst converted into\nacetaldehyde via the enzyme alcohol\ndehydrogenase, and then into\nacetate through the action of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetate\ncan then feed into biochemical\npathways bene\ufb01cial to the human\nbody.\nFor those curious, the \u2018Asian\n\ufb02ush\u2019 reaction, a genetic\ntrait common in those of\nAsian descent, is caused by\nan imbalance of the aforementioned two enzymes:\nmore e\ufb03cient alcohol dehydrogenase and less e\ufb03cient\naldehyde dehydrognase, resulting in a rapid build-up of\nacetaldehyde upon alcohol\nconsumption. Acetaldehyde\nis highly reactive and toxic at\nhigh concentrations, causing\nfurther vomiting, sweating,\nan increased pulse, and,\nmost evidently, skin \ufb02ushing.\nUnfortunately the liver is very\nmuch limited in its capacity to\nconvert ethanol into acetate. he\nrate at which ethanol is metabolised\nis set \u2013 very approximately one regular drink (one glass of wine, one\nbeer, one snakebite etc.) every\nninety minutes. Such values\nwill \ufb02uctuate from individual\nto individual depending on\ngender, but ultimately the liver\nwill only be able to take on so\nmuch work. Drink more than\nthe liver can excrete and one\u2019s\nblood alcohol level will inevitably start to rise.\nWhilst the liver tackles what\nit can the brain eventually\nfeels the impact. For the non-neuroscientist: the brain is\ncomposed of billions of neu-rons, which communicate with\none another through the release\nof chemicals known as neuro-transmitters. Some of these\npathways are excita-tory, others inhibi-tory. Ethanol\nacts upon a\nnumber of\nt h e s e\nn e u -ro-trans-m i t t e r\nsystems ,\nand it is\nthrough these\ninteractions that\nethanol functions\nas a drug.\nhe targets of ethanol within the brain are numerous,\nenough to warrant dedicated neuroscience research. In essence, ethanol\nis a depressant, enhancing the e\ufb00ect of\ninhibitory neurotransmitters, such as\nGABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid for\nfellow biochemists), whilst simultaneously weakening the e\ufb00ects of excita-tory ones, such as glutamine. Other\npathways, including ones associated\nwith behavioural responses and higher thought, are also impacted, with\nhigher-order areas of the brain, i.e. the\ncerebral cortex, a\ufb00ected before lower-order ones, i.e. the cerebellum.\nMy advice? Take it slow when drinking and give your liver time to do its\nbiochemical business. And, after\nyou\u2019ve completely ignored that sage\ntip during Freshers\u2019 Week, at least\ndrink some water before passing\nout. Your brain will thank me later.\nMilk and Tequilla is apparently\na nice cocktail. Who knew.
