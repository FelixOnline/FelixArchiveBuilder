    "content": "Six months\nof a lifetime\nAs those who know me well will\nrealise, 1 have now spent the last six\nmonths working full time for\nNorman's, the Union Snack Bar. I had a slack moment the other day,\nduring which I had a mental play with\nsome figures; the results quite\nsurprised me. The figures in question\nrelate to my use of time in those six\nmonths, and here they are:\nI estimate that I have made in\nexcess of twenty thousand cups of\ncoffee. This would have used enough\ncups to make a stack three hundred\nmetres high, weighing twenty\nkilogrammes. In making those cups,\nI clocked up a total of more than a hundred kilometres just walking from\nthe till to the coffee machine and\nback, and used about three hundred\npounds weight of coffee granules.\nI have made about five thousand\ncups of tea, adding seventy-five\nmetres to the stack of cups and twenty\nkilometres to my walking total.\nI have smoked\u2014arr gh \u2014six\nthousand cigarettes, shouted at\nNorman Jardine two hundred times,\nand had a furious row with Captain\nBraincell. I have spent a total of four\nand a half hours arguing with Simon\nBosher about gay rights, worn\nprovocative tee-shirts, and lech ed at\nmost of the Life Sciences department,\nincluding one member of staff.\nI have emerged with a great liking\nfor the raving Jock ned who runs the\nplace, and guess what? I'd do it all\nagain.\nSee you all soon,\nAndrew Bannister LP\n(Leftie Poofter)\nFlash\nLast October I was dragged along to\nthe Gate Theatre in Notting Hill Gate\nto see a new comedy trio curiously\nnamed Flash Haddock. After\nappearing in numerous Electrical\nEngineering revues and Beit Hall\nparties I was assured they were worth\na try. The show was a huge success;\nalthough their acting was useless, the\nmaterial was well thought out and the\naudience were behind them all the\nway.\nOn the strength of their success that\nnight, Flash Haddock were contracted\nto appear at the Gate in February this\nyear and my curiosity forced me to\nfind out how they had progressed.\nThe change was very noticeable. The\nscript, as before, was hilarious but\nnow they could act. No longer were\nin the\nthey just an unprofessional comedy\ntrio hoping for a break in the\nentertainments world, they showed\nauthenticity and professionalism.\nEnticed by the odd name and their\nfantastic script writing I chatted to\nthem recently about their work in\ncomedy revue.\nFlash Haddock are not a wacky\nband of surrealists. 'Don't even\nmention the words wacky or zany in\nthis,' they said 'that's just the kind of\nhumour we're not'. So I did. The\nthree present members of Flash\nHaddock, Josh (James O 'Shea),\nDouglas Earl and Malcolm Busby are\nall ex-IC students from Electrical\nEngineering. Directed by Ashid\nHilne, they have just finished a three\nweek stint at the Gate Theatre and\nOPINION\nFrom South Africa to Palestine\n\"You can kill the dreamer\nbut you cannot kill the dream\nThe dream is freedom\nthe dream is alive\nand no amount of force will\nchange that\"\nThe Roman Catholic Archbishop of\nCape Town (Feb 88)\nSubmitted by S Alami,\nChem Eng PG.\nthree weeks at the Canal Cafe\nTheatre, Little Venice and are\ncurrently writing material for News\nReview, the largest running revue\nshow in London. They have been\nhailed as 'the best new scriptwriters\nin years', by Ian Christinsen, who\ntook them on for News Review and\nare presently trying for work with\nBBC Radio.\nFlash Haddock describe their\nhumour as a cross between Monty\nPython and Not the 9 O 'Clock News.\nMade up of short sketches, their act\nstands out from the run of the mill\nstand-up comedy, most of which has\nlittle variation. They pride themselves\non their rapid turnover of material,\neven their favourite sketches are\ncontinually being revamped.\nIf you fancy the idea of Ronald\nReagan fooling the world into\nthinking he's thick or a very tongue\nin cheek view of American TV\neven ge lists, Flash Haddock are\nappearing, with a new revue,\nRobocod at IC on Wednesday March\n23 at 9pm in the Lounge.

We've got loads of features,\nreports and letters, and the whole\nthing took a very long time to put\ntogether\u2014so appreciate it.\nMy favourite bits in FELIX this\nterm have to include the features on\nbody language and courtship gestures.\nThis week we have featured\ngraphology as the centre spread. This\nscience is almost as fascinating as\nobserving people. Am I the only one\nwho has spent the last month watching\npeople making open crotch displays\nat one another? Before I used to think\nthat particular people were\nsexy/charming/charismatic but now I just know that they can use their body\nlanguage to its full effect.\nGraphology can also reveal more\nabout your character, although it is\na far cruder way of analysing your\nfriends. I spent the weekend\ndiscovering that I am an egotist who\nenjoys dominating others. But I knew\nthat already.\nQuorum\nIn the last issue I was severely\nrestricted for space so I was unable\nto write about the Results Union\nGeneral Meeting which took place\ntwo weeks ago. I decided to sit to the\nback of the meeting with the students\nwho were more interested in eating\ntheir QT burgers than watching the\nantics of various Union Officers. I spent most of the meeting explaining\nto curious observers what was\nhappening the other side of the room.\nThey were none the wiser. Procedure\nis a hard thing to explain.\nWhen the voting took place it was\nclear that only about eighty people\nwere actually taking part in the\nmeeting. There were over three\nhundred people in the room but the\nmeeting was clearly in quo rate. I am of the opinion that the idea of\ntaking the General Meetings into the\nJCR hasn't worked\u2014it hasn't attracted any more people to the\nUnion and 'Quorum' has been abused\njust as much in there as it was in the\nGreat Hall last year. At least in the\nGreat Hall you had a fair idea of who\nwas interested in the Union and how\nit was run. Your voice could be heard\nand everything was treated in a more\nserious fashion than it has been this\nyear. I think that next year's UGM\nChairman should consider moving the\nvenue back to the Great Hall and sort\nout some serious publicity for such\nevents. This year's has been abysmal.\nWhile on the subject of the abuse\nof the call of Quorum, I must say how\nstupid and childish it was of our\nPresident to call Quorum in the\nmiddle of a Union General Meeting\njust because the meeting was not\ntaking the direction he wanted.\nGambling\nShould FELIX be encouraging\nstudents to gamble their grants away?\nThis is a question that several people\nhave asked me recently. I think that\nit is a harmless bit of fun because I know when to stop. Unfortunately I know of at least one student who is\nin severe debt and still gambles.\nAuntie Judi's advice is only gamble\nif you can afford to lose your stake\nand don't put bets on any of the horses\nPaul Shanley recommends. Just\nremember that it's only the bookies\nwho win.\nBaron\nFollowing the shock revelation last\nissue that I was going to scrap the\nBaron, there has been a flood of\nprotests. I am going to spend the next\nthree days conducting a straw poll\naround College on the subject. If the\nmajority want to keep The Baron,\nthen it will be resurrected.\nControversy\nMy editorials seem to have caused a great deal of controversy recently. I even have lesser editors mentioning\nthem in their editorials. My 'election\nresults' editorial was written while I was in an extremely cynical mood. I still stand by what I said, because Mr\nGoodwin distorted 'facts' in his\nelection material in order to win, I am\nnot alone in my feelings.\nPrint Unit\nDue to the printer's oncoming\ntemporary nervous breakdown, the\nPrint Unit will be closed from today\nfor a month. I 'll still be in the Office\nover the Easter holidays if you need\nany photocopying done, artwork\nadvice or technical process work\ndone.\nFinally\nRoll on the holidays, don't eat too\nmany Easter Eggs and get as much\nrevision done as you can.

    "content": "Handwritten\nsignatures have\nlong been accepted\nas unique to each\nindividual. Most\npeople can\nrecognise, and\ndistinguish\nbetween, the\nhandwriting of\nvarious friends and\nrelations. So it is\nhardly surprising\nthat as far back as\nRoman-times\npeople have tried to\ndeduce personality\nfrom the\nappearance of\nhandwriting.\nGraphology is still a hotly debated\ntopic. Many people find it hard to\nbelieve in\u2014after all, writing is\nproduced by the movement of the\nhand, and it seems that all it can\nreveal would be skill or routine of the\nhand muscles. And as most people\nwill have noticed, one's handwriting\ncan vary considerably from time to\ntime\u2014how can anything so variable\nshow fundamental character traits?\nGraphologists argue that even when\npeople use either hand, their toes, or\nany other technique, their writing\nshows the same recognisable\ncharacteristics.\nWhatever you may feel about the\nway specific letter forms are said to\nbe linked to specific traits, graphology\nis firmly believed in by numerous\npeople, some companies go as far as\nhiring a graphologist to analyse the\nhandwriting of prospective\nemployees. Handwriting experts are\nregularly called upon to determine\nwhether signatures and handwritten\ndocuments are genuine or forced.\nAnd there does seem to be definite\nevidence linking the state of one's handwriting with the state of one's mind. The classic example of this is\nseen in the signatures of President\nNixon during the Watergate scandal,\nwhich gradually became more and\nmore like a straight line as the crisis\nworsened.\nAs happens even in more\nestablished sciences, there are as\nmany theories in graphology as there\nare practitioners. Scanning through\nthe various books written about the\nsubject shows that though many basic\nideas are common to them all, the\ndetails vary. To complicate matters\nfurther, the same characteristics have\ndifferent meanings depending on what\nother features the writing shows. A deteriorating signature, for example,\nmay show increasing stress, or simply\nthat the person has had to sign his/her\nname so often that he/she has become\nincreasingly casual about it.\nThe first book dealing with the\nrelationship between handwriting and\nthe character of the writer was\npublished by a Halion Professor of\nTheoretic Medicine, Cavillo Baldi, in\n1622. From this time the number of\ntreatises about the subject increased\nsteadily, until in the early nineteenth\ncentury the systematic study of\nhandwriting was taken up by a group\nof French clergy. One of these men\nbecame the teacher of the French\nabbot and novelist, Jean Hippolyte\nMichan, who is a knowledge d as the\nfounder of graphology as a science.\nHe worked from experience and\nobservation, comparing the\nhandwriting of people whose\ncharacters he was familiar with and\ndetermining common features. His\nbook, published in 1875, describes\nalmost all the signs and rules on which\ngraphology is still based. However,\nhe did not attempt to explain the\nreasons for the production of these\nsigns.\nThe theory of graphology was\nrefined by a group of German\nacademics. In 1897 a grapho logical periodical and a society for\ngrapho logical research were founded\nby Hans Busse. Dr Ludwig Klages,\na major contributor to the periodical,\nwas the first to create a complete and\nsystematic theory of graphology,\nbased on the idea that writing is a conflict between mental discipline and\nnatural rhythms. By analysing\nchangeable and unchangeable\nelements of handwriting, he also\nfound a way to unravel disguised\nwriting. But his efforts had their\nfaults\u2014for one thing his prejudices\nabout character left their stamp on his\ntheories, and he tended to look down\non the empirical work of French\ngraphologists so that the study became\nbased purely on theory.\nIt was left to two other men to fill\nthe main gaps in Klages' theory.\nRobert Saudek, originally from\nCzechoslovakia, specialised in the\neffects of the various national styles\nof handwriting. He was particularly\nconcerned with the study of English\nhandwriting and one of the most\nimportant factors, speed. This\nallowed for the first time all the\nEuropean grapho logical work to be\napplied in England. The second\nimportant idea, the link between\ngraphology and modern views on the\npsychology of the unconscious, was\nfirst worked on by Max Pulver, of\nSwitzerland. He emphasised the\nproblem of what the writing space\nsymbolises in the writer's mind.\nBesides the general study of\nwriting, several more specialised\nfields have been investigated. These\ninclude the identification of\nhandwriting, the expression of sexual\ncharacter in handwriting, and the\neffect of illness in handwriting.\nStudies of graphology have not been\nlimited to Europe, or to serious\nresearchers. Among these English\n'amateurs' who have added their\nsmall contribution to the science, or\nart, are the Brownings, Byron,\nGainsborough (the painter) and\nDisraeli.\nea ning s There are several basic tendencies\nwhich are studied by graphologists:\nthe size and width of writing, the form\nand degree of connection, the\nregularity and speed, the fullness and\npressure, the angle of writing and any\nright or left tendencies. It is essential\nthat if you try to analyse anybody's handwriting, you must analyse all\ntendencies and not just one. As with\nbody language, no general tendency\nin handwriting, and no single sign, is\nby itself adequate to judge a quality\nin a man's character. Each tendency\nhas many meanings.\nSize & Width\n(\nimportant to any man) The size of a person's writing is often\nan indicator as to how much space a person is satisfied with. Large\nhandwriting is taken to mean that the\nwriter needs more space in his life;\nsmall means that the writer can satisfy\nhimself in the space available to him:\nLarge:- objectivity, ambition, self-confidence, enthusiasm, leadership,\ndesire to lead a good life, lack of\nmodesty, lack of tact, megalomania,\nlack of accuracy, tendency to be a poseur.\nSmall:- inferiority complexes,\nobedience, accuracy, reliability,\n20 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 LINSTEAD and Tizard Halls of\nResidence don't seem to be hitting it\noff at the moment. Linstead\ncelebrated its birthday last week with\na party and a large message across the\nwindows of the hall reading 'Happy\nBirthday Linstead'. This was soon\nfollowed by a message on Tizard's gallery level window saying 'We hate\nLinstead'. Linstead retaliated by\ninvading Tizard and, in the process,\nflooded a landing, removed all the\nlavatory chains from one staircase and\npinched all the toilet paper in\nSouthside.\nAll wacky stuff, but my spies tell\nme that it was not the residents of\nTizard who wrote the offending\nmessage. It was, in fact, a subversive\nFalmouth-Keogh group, known as\nB* st*rd Soc, that has reaped havoc\naround Southside for several weeks\nnow.\nBut why did Tizard not remove the\nmessage when they saw what BSoc\nhad done? Answers on windows\nplease.\n\u2022 MORE STORIES of wacky\ngoings on in the halls of residence\nreached me this week. Apparently the\nlatest rage in one of the halls is\nstealing people's door handles. A more advanced version of this is to\nunscrew the handle and take out the\nbar connecting the inner and outer\nhandles and refit the handle. The lock,\ntherefore, looks untouched but is\nrendered inoperative, trapping the\nowner either inside or outside.\nOne unfortunate 'victim' of this\nwas a female postgraduate who had\nher bar removed at midnight on\nSaturday. She didn't discover it until\nthe next morning.\n\u2022 WHO IS the Phantom Electrician\nof the Union Building? This strange\npoltergeist has been nicking the light\nbulbs from the lift as fast as the Union\ncan replace them. STOIC Technical\nManager 'Axeman' Jon Denham\nthought that he could get the better of\nthis ghost. He fitted a200W bulb\nwhich was so bright it gave lift\npassengers a suntan, and so hot that\nno mortal could have removed it.\nHowever, the Phantom struck again,\nand within two days the remains of\nthe bulb were seen scattered all over\nlevel four of the Union Building.\n\u2022 THE FUNNIEST thing to reach\nmy ears this week was the tale of the\nIC Radio elections. A tough campaign\nwas fought between 'naughty' Nigel\nWhitfield, final year chemist Richard\nFincher and Judith Hackney, who\nneeds something to do next year.\nRichard was elected after the\nreallocation of Judith's votes and\nadmitted that he was somewhat\nsurprised by the outcome. 'I voted\nJudith 1 and me 2, actually,' he said\nlater!\n\u2022 THERE WERE cheers in every\npart of the College two weeks ago\nwhen Syd Harbour Bridge (nee\nHowgate) threw a tantrum and\nwithdrew from the race for UGM\nChairman when the Results U GM decided not to let the new Constitution\nand Policy Officer (CPO) through. He\nseems to have taken the loss of his\nchosen post next year to heart. He was\nrecently seen in the Bar shouting after\nwinner Paul 'Shan' Shanley, 'I 'll be\nwatching you every step of the way\nnext year'.\nMy sources close to the great\nBridge tell me that he has contingency\nplans. He believes that he will\ndefinitely be the next sub warden of\nSouthwell House, Evelyn Gardens\nwhen the post is advertised next term.\nWhy? Because great friend, and one\ntime presidential proposer, Ken\nYoung is the Warden there and has\npromised him the job.\nIf this plan falls through, or even\nif it doesn't, he will be watching for\nany slips that Shan makes so that he\ncan 'No Confidence' him and\nreinstate the CPO.\nMr Harbour Bridge has also\nconfided to his close friends that he\nintends to run for a second term as\nICU President. Niggly Nigel Baker\nis just 'keeping his seat warm'!\n\u2022 IF MR SHB does stand for\nPresident next year, he will certainly\nhave some stiff opposition. We've\nonly just got rid of this year's sabbatical elections and potential\ncandidates for the 1989/90 session are\nalready making statements of intent.\nThose in the running so far are Neil\nMcCluskey, current Recreational\nClubs Committee Chairman, who is\nbecoming increasingly vocal on all the\nimportant Union committees he can\nget himself on, also several Beans\nClub candidates and a hamster. The\nFELIX Office is running a bet on\nwhether SHB will manage a 'Ronald\nReagan' or just fade into obscurity.\n\u2022WHY IS THERE so much interest\nin the dr on go post of Union Publicity\nOfficer for next year? For the last few\nyears no-one has come forward to do\nthis thankless job, but there will be\nas many as five candidates this year.\nIs this because a certain well-known\nICU President made it clear that he\nwould stand for this post as a last\nresort if he didn't get CPO?\n\u2022 TOY BOY Paul 'Ego' Shanley has\nbeen leading poor, impressionable\nFELIX Editor Judith Hackney astray.\nEvery since he became a regular\nfixture in the FELIX Office, she has\nbeen seen drinking alcohol, betting on\nthe nags and indulging in indecent\ninterviewing techniques. Staff are\nLibel\nbecoming increasingly concerned by\nthis abnormal behaviour and were\noutraged to find the two watching the\nCheltenham Gold Cup on a television\nin the FELIX Office especially\nimported for the occasion last\nThursday. Miss Hackney, 22, denies\neverything.\n\u2022 FAILED HON SEC candidate\nRodger Houghton has gone into deep\ndepression since being defeated. He\nhas been sighted getting paralytic in\nSouthside Bar in the company of\nseveral young ladies. This came to a head last week when, after losing-his\nglasses, he turned up at a house he no\nlonger resides in, wearing only one\nshoe. Fellow residents at Lexham\nGardens have taken to calling him\n'Cinderella'. But will Rodger ever\nfind his prince?\n\u2022WHAT DOES a warden do with\nfive free hours?\nNew Holbein Warden Chris\nToumazou might know. Recently he\ndecided to emulate his residents by\ndoing some serious sharking at a party\nin Linstead Hall. He was cornered by\na fellow (female) warden and then\ndisappeared at midnight. He was next\nseen when he interrupted a Holbein\nall-night poker school at 5.00am.

Conclusive\nproof that common sense and\nintelligence are completely\nunrelated.\n55\nSpring\u2014that time\nof year when right-minded hacks of all\ndescriptions survey\nthe sabbatical\nhorizon and think\nabout their job next\nyear, and that\nmeans\u2014Elections.\n4 4\nWatch out for the guy in Beit,\nwho doesn't answer a knock at\nhis door, and when you pop a leaflet into his room, opens the\ndoor about an inch, and throws\nyour screwed up leaflet across\nthe corridor. The door then\nslams. Obviously a quick\nreader, he has decided that it is\nall a load of crap and takes the\nappropriate action. ^ ^\nFELIX\nMost important is to convince\nyourself that you actually want to do\nthe job\u2014and not just win the election.\nAbility isn't important at this stage.\nMore excitement was added this year\nwhen in January the goalposts were\nmoved at lightening speed: the\nsabbatical job descriptions were\nchanged while ICU Council\ncollectively yawned.\nOnce you've found out what the job\nwill be (or, in some cases, have\nwritten it yourself), you're all set.\nThere then follows the crucial 'run-up', when the plan is to 'build your\nimage'. There are two orthodox\nmethods\u2014either the 'blanket' system:\n'my name was in FELIX fourteen\ntimes last week', or the more selective\nT saved IC Union \u00a3 3 0 , 0 0 0 by\nrecycling hot air' credibility. Avoid,\nat all costs any admission that you are\neven thinking about contemplating\nwriting to your Auntie telling her you\nmight be standing. This is the kiss of\ndeath.\nThe fun really starts when the\npapers go up on the noticeboard for\nthe candidates. Again, there are two\nschools of thought. The first 'cocky\nbastard' method is to slap your name\ndown within thirty seconds of the final\ndrawing pin being pushed in, then get\nyour proposer and twenty second ers queueing behind you. This\n'blitzkrieg' technique is calculated to\ngive you a psychological advantage\nover the opposition, lesser candidates,\nas the theory goes, scurry back to the\nwoodwork. It had an added bonus this\nyear, as the papers were arranged so\nthat only the top ones were visible,\nand your name was the only one\npeople saw when rushing for the\nNorman's queue.\nThe other method is the 'late\nrush'\u2014lull the opponents into a false\nsense of security, then rush at the\npaper with your crowd just before the\npapers are down. With luck and the\nright rumours, you can leave your\nopponent flat-footed, with no\npublicity and no campaign, after two\nweeks of thinking they wouldn't even\nhave an election.\nPublicity is your next headache.\nYou have to negotiate a FELIX Office\nfull of sabbatical wanna-bes, all\nconvinced that they should have the\noffice to themselves. This isn't possible, as you need it all yourself.\nAs well as negotiating with a tired and\nincreasingly emotional FELIX Editor,\nyou also have to contend with tired\nand increasingly emotional FELIX\nequipment (it's part of the service\ncontract that every bit must break\ndown at least twice in election week).\nYou also have to think of a witty\nslogan\u2014something that will still be\nwitty after a week's campaigning and\nplastering on every available brick in\nCollege. A silly gimmick is also\nuseful\u2014silly haircuts or hats are a definite plus. Anything to get the\nelectorate to remember your name.\nYou also have to get your publicity\napproved by the all-powerful elections\ncommittee. This consists of a group\nof normally harmless random s, who,\nfor two weeks, have the power of life\nand death over all the candidates. It's amazing, like putting someone behind\nthe wheel of a car. The most innocent\ninsubstantial nobody suddenly\nbecomes a power-crazed ego-maniac.\nThey may only get this one chance at\nauthority, and they're damned well\ngoing to use it. Pity the candidate that\nbuys a packet of drawing pins without\nchecking with them first. It's not even\nenough, sometimes, to get one of\nthem to agree\u2014the others may have\nanother view. Apparently it's not\neven enough to get them all to\nagree\u2014they change their minds later\nthat afternoon. As I said, they're\ndamned well going for it.\nOK, so papers come down, you\nhave reams of posters and handouts,\npockets full of blu-tak, and have\nconcealed all your irregularities from\nthe authorities. All you do now is sell\nyourself to the punters. The problem\nwith this is that they're not interested.\nThe average student's attention span\non anything non-alcoholic is about ten\nseconds\u2014just enough time to say,\n'Hi, I'm Margaret Thatcher, I'm standing in the sabbatical ele...' when\nthey walk away, probably wondering\nwhat a sabbatical is.\nKnocking on hall doors is fun\u2014just\nwalk in, take no notice of the couple\ndisentangling themselves from each\nanother on the bed, and give them a handout. Two votes in the bag.\nHustings is the time when you get\na chance to speak to the masses(?).\nStunts usually aren'ta good idea,\nunless you can pack the house with\nyour supporters. The idea is,\nobviously, to rubbish your opposition\nand look great yourself. However, it's said you can never win at a hustings\u2014only lose one. Keep your\nhead and don't, whatever you do,\nshow anything of your true character.\nYou'll get torn to pieces. At hustings\nyou are 'Mr/Ms Nice Guy' and\nnothing else.\nThe questions are OK, as long as\nyou aren't asked them first. This is\nbecause the Public Address is so loud\nthat you could probably hear the\nquestions in the Union Building,\nnever mind the corridor off the Great\nHall (where you're put so that you\ncan't hear the questions). Going last\nis even better as you hear all the other\ncandidates' answers as well. This\nespecially helps on relevant questions\nsuch as 'What is 1037 minus 649'.\nThat is the other feature of hustings,\nthe asking of completely irrelevant\nquestions like this to, I'm told, 'bring\nout your character'. Who are they\nkidding?\nCome election day, you're either\nup, or you ain't, or you can't be\nbothered anymore anyway. One\nredeeming feature of IC elections,\nmust be their complete\nunpredictability. It seems the average\nvoter only decides who to vote for\nabout ten seconds after they leave the\nballot box. Complete outsiders, who\nhave all but given up, have been\nknown to be elected by landslides.\nThere has never been any proof that\na good campaign every got any votes,\nso you're in with a chance right up\nto the finish post.\nOnce the big day arrives, there's nothing for it but to get completely\nsmashed out of your brains! Being\nsober is no good if you lose, and you\ncan't stay sober that long if you win.\nIt's not very clear what's worse-winning or losing. It's great to win\nthe election, but then you have to do\nthe job...or you could always\nresign...and then there'll be another\nelection.\nYou enjoyed it so much, you might\neven stand again!\nWednesday 23rd March 1988 17\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 This term started off with a cracker\nof a story about Linstead's ill-fated\nbasement sale in December. What had\nbeen thought as an obvious way to reorganise the storage area in the Hall,\nturned out to be an insurers nightmare\nwhen several angry students tried to\nreclaim their belongings which had\nbeen sold several weeks beforehand.\nIt all began when Linstead Hall\nConvenor Martin Whitfield suggested\nthat the basement area should be\ncleared and any unwanted property\nsold for charity and to raise funds for\nthe Hall's twentieth birthday party.\nThe Hall committee put up posters\nand several small ads in FELIX to\nannounce the clear out and sale. Only\nunmarked packages were opened,\nwith all the old clothes being donated\nto Oxfam and valuable goods put\naside for sale. They found three\ntelevisions, three stereos, ski boots,\na windsurfing outfit, a computer and\nthree bicycles which were all sold and\nraised over a thousand pounds in the\nprocess.\nThis was all very well for the Hall\ncommittee and its party but several\nother students were none to pleased\nwith the sale of their goods. It was\nclaimed that the organisers had\nopened marked packages, as well as\nthose that were not marked, and not\nput enough effort into finding the\noriginal owners.\nThe outcome was that an enquiry\nwas held to stop such incidents\nhappening again, the party was a great\nsuccess and the College insurers are\nstill arguing about who should pay.\n\u2022 Student accommodation has been in\nthe news several times this term.\nDespite gaining Fisher Hall in Evelyn\nGardens, College administration will\nnot be able to guarantee all next year's intake a room in a hall or house. The\nsituation was caused by the loss of\nRayleigh House, a house in Lexham\nGardens and a large chunk of Hamlet\nGardens residences. Rayleigh was\nlost to provided the furnishing of the\nnew Evelyn Gardens hall, 54 Lexham\nGardens was found to be\novercrowded and not suitable\naccommodation. Hamlet was the\nsame.\nFisher Hall may have been able to\ntake the loss if it were not for the fact\nthat College administration had\npushed Registry into providing more\nplaces for overseas students to cover\nthe \u00a3 3 m deficit the College had\nacquired.\nThe Union and, in particular,\nPresident Ian Howgate felt that they\nhad been misled by College when\nthey agreed to allow increased rents\nto cover the purchase of Fisher. It was\neasy to see that the students were\nbeing asked to cover the cost just so\nthat admin could reduce its debt.\nThings came to a head mid-term\nwhen College asked the Union to\naccepted bar increases of up to lOp\non a pint to cover the cost of refectory\nrefurbishment. If they didn't, College\nsaid that the money would have to\ncome from another rent increase.\nIt was an impossible situation\nbrought on by the overlap of three\nCollege accounts. Money could be\nmoved from the Residents Account to\nthe Conferences Account by allowing\nConferences re-let Summer\naccommodation at a big profit. Any\nmoney made by Conferences did not\ngo back to the Residents but was used\nby the Catering Account. College\nwanted to provide better facilities\nsuch as the QT Burger outlet and\nBelushis in Southside but the initial\ninvestment had to be a large one. The\nUnion, concerned that so much\nmoney was being spent on\nrefurbishment of the bars and food\noutlets and not being ploughed back\ninto accommodation, felt trapped. At\nthe College's Bar Committee they\nargued that savings could be made in\nother areas.\nThe Union wanted more\ninformation before allowing such an\nincrease. The plan was shelved.\n\u2022 It is clear that most students will be\nworse off after April 1st. Kenneth\nBaker announced a4% increase in the\ngrants next year and Nigel Lawson\nreorganised the covenant system in\nhis March budget. The Conservative\nNEWS\nREVIEW would be a postgraduate only hall\nfollowing bitter r angling s between the\nhalls around Princes Gardens. It\nseemed that Weeks was the ideal\nchoice until Vickers, the engineering\ncompany who had provided the\nfunding for the Hall, expressed their\ndispleasure at the decision.\n\u2022 The College was trying to raise\nmoney in other ways. Administration\ndecided that money could be saved if\nthey de-centralised the Central Stores.\nNALGO argued otherwise and a bitter battle has been fought by the CS\nstaff to save the service.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, IC Union and its music\nsocieties were fighting the decision to\nmove the Music Room in 53 Princes\nGate to a terminal room in the\nGovernment said that they were still\nconsidering bringing in student loans.\nMost students said that they had loans\nalready.\n\u2022 It was announced that Weeks Hall\nComputing Department because the\nnew Management School wanted the\nspace. Despite noisy protests\nthroughout the year, the move went\nahead and the music societies have\nbeen told that if enough sponsorship\ncan be raised, the College will build\na new music block under the old\nHolland Club! This came as a shock\nto one or two people who had seen\nthe plans submitted to the local\ncouncil for that site. They consisted\nof a function hall with a bar.\nInteresting.\n\u2022 Imperial College Union also went\nthrough great changes this term.\nFollowing a surprise restructuring of\nthe Union management at the\nbeginning of term, a new Union\nManager has been head-hunted from\nULU. The new Finance Officer also\njoined the team this term. Critics of\nthe new organisation have said that\nthe Union is becoming too introverted\nand more concerned with its own\nrunning than with student issue.\nPresident Ian Howgate, meanwhile,\nbelieves it to be great step forward.\nHe is convinced that better\norganisation will mean that more\nstudent will want to get involved with\nthe Union and use its services.\n\u2022 The merger with St Mary's is due\nto take place in August. Their Union\nvoted to become the fourth\nConstituent College Union of\nImperial College Union but not a single ballot box for the sabbatical\nelections was taken over to\nPaddington.\n\u2022 The elections came and went. The\nresults were predictable and the anticlimax considerable. The whole thing\nbored us silly.\n\u2022 Ian Howgate provided some light\nrelief mid-term when he changed his\n\u2022name for charity to Sydney HarbourBridge. He even managed to get\nhimself onto page 3 of The Sun.\nThat's where they put all the tits.\n\u2022 FELIX came under some heavy fire\nfor being Howgatist.\n\u2022 The Christian Union was thrown\nout of ICU because of its constitution.\nThe CU demands that its members\nshould sign a statement of faith. The\nUnion demands that any ICU member\nshould have the right to join any of\nits societies. They should not have to\nsign any statements. The debate is still\ngoing on as to whether exceptions\nshould be made in the case of\nreligious societies.\n\u2022 Finally, the Union and the GERBIL\nmade the headlines at the beginning\nof March when Imperial College went\non strike for a day. Over two\nthousand IC students didn't go to\nlectures on 1st March and a few even\nwent to lobby their MPs about the\nGovernment's proposed Education\nReform Bill. Everybody thought the\nwhole exercise had been a great\nsuccess and it just goes to show that\nthe Union can be a political voice\nwhen it wants to be. God forbid.\nFELIX Wednesday 23rd March 1988 15\n\n"

    "content": "Who needs a budget? Andrew Daglish,\nChunderer of the\nChesschequer,\noutlines his plans\nfor the instant\nrevival of the\nempire and\neconomy.\nA government somewhere has been\nradical, even revolutionary, but it lost\npower because it was not\nrevolutionary enough and, trying to\nprevent the completion of the\nrevolution, was crushed beneath the\noverwhelming forces it had\nunleashed. This fate is about to befall\nanother government somewhere else.\nIn order to spare the populace the\nrevolting task of having to scrape so\nmuch politician jelly from beneath the\nwheel of progress I now present my\neconomic masterpiece.\nIn essence it is quite simple. I will\nintroduce social ownership to the\nRoyal Mint. This privatisation will be\nopen to every man, woman and child\nin the country, and one or two of the\nmore upwardly mobile cats and dogs\n(puppies) too. Companies, institutions\nand anyone or anything else will not,\nrepeat not, as in categorically banned,\nbe able to take advantage of this once-in-a lifetime offer. Not unless they\noffer me something I want (are you\nlistening, Aston Martin? A flame-red\nVantage Volante with tan hide\nupholstery would do nicely, thank\nyou). Money will not be something\nI want, as you will come to see.\nWhy should this be so\nadvantageous to Mr and Mrs Joe and\nJosephine Public? What do they get\nfor their money? And how much will\nthat be?\nAs I have said, it is quite simple.\nFor the price of a printing press, plus\nVAT, postage and packing, they will\nreceive a printing press, instructions\nfor use, plus plates of all current Bank\nof England notes. And before socialist\nparties of the world start trying to\nverbally castrate me because Joe and\nJosephine don't have the ready cash\nfor a brand spanking (listening,\nSydney?) new, all singing, all dancing\nprinting press (currently in the order\nof \u00a3 1 0 million, excluding VAT, postage and packing), I am offering\neasy terms.\nFor a deposit of just \u00a35 they (Joe\nand Josephine that is, not necessarily\nthe socialist parties) will receive their\nnew toy. The difference is payable on\ncommencement of printing. What\ncould be fairer?\n\"How will this effect the immediate\nrecovery of the (or indeed any)\neconomy?\" I hear you cry (I 've got\nvery good hearing).\nI think there are about 56 million\npeople in a certain country.\nAdmittedly, I haven't met them all,\nso I can't swear by this figure (well\nI could, but it would be asterisked out)\nbut as a lot of other people whom I have met also believe there are that\nmany people in a country then I am\ngoing to publish and be * * * * * * ,\nalthough we could be talking about a different countries.\nSo, having arrived at the\nconclusion, though not having\nrigorously proved it, that there are 56\nmillion people in a country and also\nthat most of them, -say about 560\nmillion, are going to want to take\nadvantage of the offer, this means that\nthere is going to be one heck of a demand for these super-du per printing\npresses.\nNot only that, but these have to be\ndelivered, requiring rather more\narticulated lorries than cur rend y exist\non an utterly insignificant little bluegreen planet orbiting a small yellow\nsun in the uncharted backwaters of the\nGalaxy at a distance of roughly\nninety-two million miles (or more\naccurately, 92.6 million). (Thank\nyou, Douglas).\nFurther, all 5600 million of them\n(allowing for multiple applications\nwhich will not be turned down) have\nto be installed, which will of course\naccount for the working lives of\neveryone/thing (not wishing to be\nspecies is t) qualified to do so, and\nmany of those who are not, for rather\na lot of generations to come,\nespecially if they get themselves\norganised into a union and work to\nrule.\nIn addition, the roads to convey the\nvehicles at a sufficiently rapid rate\nhave to be constructed, as do\nbuildings in which to install the\npresses (it should be pointed out that\nthese things cannot be shoved in the\nwash house/utility room, or even in\nyour average, or not so, two-up, two-down), which will in turn tie up most\nof the world's construction trade for\nmost of the next two or so major\ncivilisations.\nThe following industries will also\nbe major beneficiaries of the offer:\na) The chemicals industry. They\nwill have to supply the inks and dyes\nto print the notes. This should result\nin (i) this industry in this random\ncountry becoming the biggest in the\nworld (ii) lonely housewives/\nhusbands getting their daily quotas\nfrom ink men. b) Forestry and the white paper\nrecycling industry. The latter on its\nown has shown its inability to cope\nwith such demand following its lack\nof success in achieving greater than\n150% yields on full scale operations.\nHence we're going to have to plant\nlots more trees! Unfortunately, we're\nalso going to have to cut them all\ndown again. Ah, well, you win some,\nyou lose some.\nc) The power supply. Depending on\nwhere the recipients live, these will\nbe the coal board, the CEGB, British\nGas, BNF, SHE, your local whippet\nbreeder or Hot Air Corp Inc (for\nresidents in the vicinity of the seat of\ngovernment only). This offer will\nprovide un parallelled opportunities\nfor research, development and sheer\nexploitation of the customer in these\nindustries.\nHowever, these will not be the only\nlucky winners. Just think of all the fun\ntruck manufacturers will have as\npeople move away from mere wallets!\nAnd what about safe-makers (and\nbreakers) and bodyguard (and assault-troop) agencies? The possibilities are\nendless.\nSo much for economics, although\nthese will sneak into the next section\njust a teeny-wee ny whacking great\nbit. Having appealed to and satisfied\nthe socialist-capitalist in you all (I'm one * * * * of a guy, and modest with\nit), and having in the process, created\na uniformly rich and class-free\nsociety, I now wish to appeal to the\npatriotism of you random dwellers in\na country somewhere.\nI wish, nay, want to create the\ngreatest empire in history as I( admittedly slightly biased ly) know it.\nBut unlike previous emperors I do not\nwant the lives of your sons and\ndaughters. I just want some (and not\na lot at that) of your new-found\nwealth.\nYou see, it all gets down to other\ncountries' money-supply. Basically,\nwe under-cut them. We can supply\nthem with money cheaper than\nanyone else, on condition that they\nonly use ours. Of course we can then\nflood their economies and destabilize\ntheir governments and Bingo! one\nworld-wide empire.\nFELIX Wednesday 23rd March 1988 23\n\n"

Opposing will be Imperial\nCollege Union President Ian/Sydney\nHowgate/Harbour-Bridge, seconded\nby Alan Rose (Deputy President).\nIf ICU does join the NUS this could\ncost the Union in the region of\n\u00a3 3 0 , 0 0 0 , however, some students\nwould like to see IC getting involved\nin the NUS's campaigns against\nstudent loans, poll tax, etc.\nThere will be opportunities to ask\nquestions afterwards. Given the\nstrong views of many students on the\nmatter, this should be well worth\ngoing to.\nGliding\nFebruary 19 was the date of Imperial\nCollege Gliding Club's most\nauspicious event, the Annual Dinner,\nheld at the Royal Aeronautical\nSociety.\nBoth past and present student\nmembers attended. Among the invited\nguests were officials of Lasham\nGliding Society including Mr Derek\nPiggot, recognised as the world's foremost gliding instructor, and a party from Surrey University Gliding\nClub.\nThe catering and service were\nexcellent. The after-dinner speech\nwas given by Mr Bill Kronfeld, an ex-IC student, who spoke of his father's major contribution to gliding this\ncentury, including the first crosscountry flight and the first glider\ntraverse of the English Channel.\nThe annual award presentations\nalso took place. Of current students\nSteve Brooker was awarded the\nPresident's Cup for an 80km crosscountry flight.\nApart from Surrey University being\nawarded the Brunt Trophy for the best\nheight gain, a good time was had by\nall!\nSo if you're interested in getting the\nHi, there. It's that time of the year\nagain when baskets are rigged,\nburners are turned on, envelopes are\ninflated and the skies are reached.\nYes, despite the awful weather\nconditions so far this year, we have\nmanaged to find the odd couple of\ndays to fly our hot-air balloon\n'Second-Wind'.\nA few weekends ago we took the\nballoon up to Loughborough\nUniversity who also have an active\nballoon club. We drove up Friday\nevening with a newly bought right\nwing mirror sell o taped on (no thanks\nto the club who lost the previous one).\nArriving a bit late we headed\nstraight for the nearest watering-hole\nwhere the next day's plans were\ncarefully (?) laid out. Also having\nforgotten a complete set of air-maps,\nour old OS maps were hurriedly\nmarked up with all the nearby air\ntraffic zones (useful places to know\nabout!). We all then crashed out at a friend's house (all twelve of us).\nNext morning bright and early we\narranged to meet at the university\ngrounds. We eventually found the\ncorrect launch site, to be greeted by\na number of other local balloonists.\nSoon all the balloons were up and\nready to go except 'Primebang', the\nrather old and leaky Loughborough\nballoon which, even after much\nBrunt Trophy back for IC, or would\nrelish the chance of explaining to your\nbank manager why, on top of a \u00a3 4 0 0\noverdraft, you have a bill for \u00a3 8 0 of\nwine then come along to Aero 254 at\n5.30pm on Thursday.\nGreenpeace\nThere is now an active Greenpeace\nsupport group for West London and\nhelp is urgently needed with a variety\nof fund-raising events (if you can\nthink of a use for a fifty foot inflatable\nwhale then let us know).\nThe first major event is the\nGreenpeace Flag Day on April 9. If\nyou are around and could spare any\ntime to hassle people in High Street\nKensington and the surrounding area\nplease get in touch with me.\nGreenpeace is a non-political\norganisation which carries out a lot\nof very worthwhile campaigns all of\nwhich need your support to continue.\nSo if you can collect or just want to\nget in touch with the support group\n(which is nothing to do with Imperial\nand has been set up by Greenpeace\nsupporters) then please contact me by\nphoning 373 1736 (Alistair Goodall\nin Flat 6) or via the Computing\npigeonholes.\nThanks a lot.\nAlistair Goodall (DoC 1)\nburning sadly refused to get off the\nground! In the end we managed to fly\nnearly everybody, using Nottingham\nUniversity for the Sunday launch and\nI believe a great weekend was had by\nall.\nA few of us also went flying last\nweekend down at Newbury. The\nweather was beautiful with the odd\nflurries of snow glittering in the\nsunshine at 2000 feet.\nWe passed nearby to a glider\nairfield and saw them being pulled up\nand then gracefully circled\ndownwards. Our final landing was\ngood but not very near to any access\nroads. A kind farmer came to our\nrescue in the form of a tractor which\nhe used to get all our equipment out\nof the field. After a couple of frantic\ntelephone calls, our retrieve crew\neventually found us and then we all\nheaded for tea and hot-chocolate\nfudge cake!\nInterested in flying in the summer\nterm and over summer? (It really isn't difficult\u2014you just stand in the basket\nand let the pilot do the rest!) Come\nto one of our regular Thursday\nlunchtime meetings at 1pm in the\nSouthside Upper Lounge (above the\nbar)\u2014just ask around for the\nballoonists. Everybody's welcome.\nJan Vonka (DoC 2).\nHealthy Democracy\nElections!

    "content": "Union Rag Fete\nOn Saturday April 30 the annual Rag\nFete will take place on and around\nQueen's Lawn. This regular mega-event is the final major fling for Rag\nbefore exams take their toll, and is an\nideal opportunity to enjoy yourself.\nAs usual, trips up the Queen's Tower\nwill be taking place offering superb\nviews of London and there's a bar\nextension until 5pm. with a regular\nbar. real ale bar and a Pimms stall.\nJez and Bo will be out offering rides\nfor all: there will be stocks, allowing\nyou to get your revenge on major\nUnion figures of this year and next;\nthere will be a large raffle, top prize\nbeing a trip for two to Paris; lots of\nstalls with food, prizes and silly\ngames: and Michael Bentine will be\ngiving a guest lecture. There will also\nbe all the regular stunts and tricks like\nfire eating and some new ones as well.\nThe Fete will be opened by Matilda\nZiegler (Donna) and Lucy Bayler\n(Elizabeth) of Eastenders at 2pm and\nwill end with the traditional wrestling\nmatch\u2014though whether it will be in\nmud or jelly this year is as yet unsure.\nThe day doesn't end then though,\nsince there will be a massive party in\nthe Union Building that night to round\noff both the Ents and Rag years.\nSo come along to Queens Lawn on\nApril 30 for a really good time, and\nif you've got a good idea for more\nstalls contact me via ICU before the\nend of term.\nSee you there!\nDave Clements.\nENTZ\nPossibly the last article I will have the\npleasure to write for FELIX, but no\ndoubt both I and the paper will\nsurvive. So what's going on down this\nweek, well on Friday March 18 two\nnew young bands will be playing in\nthe Union Lounge. The first band on\nstage will be No Mans Band who\nsome of you may have seen\nsupporting the Lemon Drops at the\nAstoria a few weeks ago. The\nheadline band go by the name of Blue\nOx Babes who's major claim to fame\nis the presence of half of Dexy's Midnight Runners including the one\nwho wrote the songs for Kevin\nRowland. Both bands are well worth\na watch especially at \u00a31.50 on the\ndoor or \u00a31 in advance. So why not\ncome along, tickets are on sale in\nNorman's and the doors open at 9pm. Mascotry Rules\nThis term new rules were set down by the Imperial College Union and\nits three Constituent College Unions based on mascot ry. These new rules\nwere called for after several unpleasant incidents took place last term.\nThe following clauses have been agreed by the Constituent College\nUnions of the Imperial College of Science and Technology:\n1. For the purposes of this agreement a mascot shall refer to such an\nobject as is defined by a Constituent College Union as the 'Violate\nMascot' of that Union. At the time of this agreement these are as\nfollows:\na) Royal School of Mines Union\u2014'Davy'\nb) Royal College of Science Union\u2014'Theta*\nc) City & Guilds College Union\u2014'Spanner & Bolt'\n2. The CCU's do not condone:\na) Any violence in mascot ry raids (you are reminded that injury\nto any person may result in disciplinary and/or legal\nproceedings).\nb) The breakage of locks, chairs, or any structures which are not\nspecifically and solely securing a mascot in place, or the last\nremaining obstacle to the mascot (eg cupboard).\n3. Mascotry is no excuse to break the law. People breaking the law\nwill have no recourse to College or Union authorities.\n4. All vehicles must abide by College regulations and speed limits.\n5. In the event of any breakage of College property or any injury being\nsustained by a member of the mascot ry team or any member of\nthe public, the President of the respective CCU and the President\nof ICU should be informed immediately.\n6. There will be no attempted raid or other interference for the durations\nof any formal e \"vent. For the purposes of masc tory a formal event\nwill be deemed to have started once the mascot is placed in the room\nfor that event, and has ended when the mascot is' removed from\nthat room.\n7. If the 'offensive' team has a number of members greater than four\ntimes the number of the 'defensive' team then a peaceful handover\nof the mascot must take place.\n8. The use of ex-students shall be strictly limited to the person driving\nthe vehicle actually carrying the mascot. Ex-students must not take\npart in any other aspect of the raid.\n9. A copy of these rules should be prominently displayed in each CCU\nOffice.\n10. Any alleged infringement of the above regulations shall be referred\nto the ICU Executive Committee, who will rule on the complaint\nand decide on a course of action as necessary. ICU Executive\nCommittee have the power to ban a person from mascot ry activity.\n11. ICU Sabbaticals must take and must be seen to be taking a neutral\npart in mascot ry. Signed on this 25th day of January 1988 for and on behalf of\nImperial College Union, Alan Rose, Deputy President.\nRoyal College of Science Union, Clare McErlane, President.\nCity & Guilds College Union, Dave Tyler, President.\nRoyal School of Mines Union, Geoff Parsons, President.\nLetter from\nSt Mary's My absence last week was due to the\nsuccess of our Rag Week. Unlike IC,\nthe students at St Mary's like the idea\nof compacting the whole Rag\nactivities into one hectic week. This\nallows the participating individuals to\ncompletely forget extra course work\noutside the lectures etc, and devote\ntheir energies entirely to the per suit of having a good time.\nOne can argue the merits of the\ndifferent approaches, and I suppose\nbeing a student here I am\nautomatically biased, but the\nconcentration achieved benefits the\nwhole exercise as there is an identity,\npeople do not tire of fund-raising, and\nanyone can try hard for a single week.\nThis Rag Week had the innovative\n(for us) Paris Dash, which by all\naccounts was thoroughly enjoyed by\nthe participants and also raised lots of\nmoney. Still out on its own in terms\nof capital generated, is the Breakfast\nParty on Paddington Station. The\nstudents dress in Pyjamas etc and sell\nRag Mags (or attempt to!) amongst\nthe morning crush of commuters.\nThis even raised \u00a34559, which set the\ntone for the rest of the week.\nA live steel band entertained the\ntroops on the Wednesday evening at\nthe Beach Party. Along with wicked\ncocktails and a limbo competition the\nfun passed far into the night.\nThe Slave Auction on Friday night\nwas unprecedented. A record \u00a31600\nwas pledged in return for the use of\na 'slave for a day'.\nI have described balls at Mary's before this so I shall just mention the\nfact that we had a Rag 'Oriental' Ball\non the Saturday. A good recovery\nservice was offered in the form of The\nJungle Book Show on Sunday evening\nwith cocoa and doughnuts.\nTuesday saw, in my opinion, the\nbest event of the week\u2014The Bands\nNight. Five bands (all in house)\nprovided three hours of live\nentertainment with excellent sound\nand the best lighting I 've seen here\nyet. All the people who attended\nthoroughly enjoyed the event\u2014the\nbest way of evaluating the success of\nan event.\nOn Wednesday the UH Rugby Cup\nFinal passed with an excellent flour,\nfish, guts and en trail fight after which\nour team thrashed the Royal Free\n32-0.\nIt also looks as if we have raised\nin excess of \u00a310,000.\n6 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "With the US Masters fast approaching\n(April 7-10) it's about time there was\nsomething other than donkeys in\nFELIX.\nPlayers in form at the moment\ninclude such new names as Jay Haas\nand Steve Jones, as well as the old\nfavourites Sandy Lyle and Seve\nBallesteros. Seve, who had a dismal\nseason last year, started \"Ms with a Augusta\nPreview\nbang in the Spanish PGA, where he\nbroke the course record, and this must\ncount for something in Augusta. He\nis quoted as being a joint favourite\nwith Greg Norman, whom I believe\nto be grossly overrated.\nThe main danger for all the top\nplayers, the man I believe will win,\nis Ian Woosnam. He burst onto the\nscene in a big way last year, earning\nmore than \u00a3 1 million, and was\ninspirational during the Ryder Cup.\nIt was his play during that competition\nin Muirfield Village, Ohio that makes\nhim such a good hope, managing to\nfind the greens accurately and\ncheaply, and holding them superbly.\nOther candidates are Nick Faldo,\nthe Open champion, whose American\nform is poor but prone to moments\nof brilliance and Bernhard Langer,\nwho won in 1985. Tom Watson and\nMark McNulty must also be hopeful\nof continuing success. I'm confident\nthat 1988 will produce European\nwinners to both the Masters and the\nUS Open, the competition is so hot\nthat it'll be worth staying up all night\nwatching it live on BBC1 on the\nFriday and Saturday nights.\nI am writing this nearly two weeks in advance of the games due to FELIX\ndeadlines, so I can't refer to last week's games as usual. All games are on\nSaturday March 26 with 3pm kick offs.\nCharlton vs Oxford\nSelhurst Park (Selhurst BR)\nThis is a real Division One relegation\nbattle with points absolutely vital to\nboth sides at this stage of the season.\nCharlton have shown a slight revival\nin recent weeks, hitting West Ham\nand Sheffield Wednesday for three.\nGarth Crooks has been\nknocking in the goals for\nthe Reds and with the\nreturn to the Valley an\nalmost certainty,\ntiling s could still\nchange for the\nbetter.\nOxford lost a recent Littlewoods\nCup semi-final to\nLuton and must\nnow concentrate on\nsurvival. To add to\ntheir trouble\nMaurice Evans has\nresigned as\nmanager. Their\nchorus of 'Yellow'\nseems forlorn. This\nwill be a close one\nbut I think that the\nhome team will\nsneak it by the odd\none in three.\nChelsea vs Southampton\nStamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)\nThe home team really do need the\npoints from this one since, at the time\nof printing, they have had no victories\nsince October 31 (I seem to have said\nthis a few times since then!). Kerry\nDixon seems set to stay at the Bridge\ndespite his wishes to move to\nHighbury and Pat Nevin's name has\nalso been mentioned in transfer talk.\nSouthampton are in mid-table but still\nneed a few more points to secure their\nplace in the top flight next season.\nDanny Wallace has shown some good\nform this season but they are not\nreally a very strong force. This looks\nlike a bland draw but the team with\na twinkle of initiative could steal\nit...hopefully.\nTottenham vs Nottingham Forest\nWhite Hart Lane (Seven Sisters tube)\nVenables' men take on Cloughie's younger men. Since taking over at\nWhite Hart Lane, Venables (I hope\nthat he never takes over the England\njob) hasn't really done much with\nSpurs only in mid-table. A recent\nhome defeat by Norwich only\nemphasised their problems, not to\nmention a40 thrashing in a friendly\nagainst Monaco. Forest have made it\nto the FA Cup semi-final for Clough\n(like I predicted young man...) with\nhis son Nigel proving a real chip off\nthe old block. They have a good\nyoung side with a strong eye for the\nfuture. Brian still thinks they can win\nthe league, who dares to argue? I think that they will win this one to\ncomplete a North London double.\nBrentford vs Brighton\nGriffin Park (Brentford Central)\nA third division game between two\nsides on the fringes of the promotion\nrace should draw a decent crowd. The\nvisitors, once a proud Division One\nteam only five years ago, are\nbeginning the long haul back from\nobscurity. Their star striker is Gary\nNelson. He was bought for just\n\u00a3 7 5 , 0 0 0 from Plymouth last summer\nand has nearly thirty goals to his name\nalready this season. Argyl tried to buy\nhim back recently, what a bunch of\njokers! This game also has a draw\nwritten all over it.\nLeyton Orient vs Swansea\nBrisbane Road (Leyton tube)\nOrient are still in the promotion race\nand must win this to keep up with\nhigh flyers Wolves and Cardiff.\nSwansea were taken from the fourth\nto the first by John Toshack and even\ngot into the UEFA Cup, but he has\ngone to Real Sociadad in Spain and\nthe Welsh team have fallen to whence\nthey came. They almost went out of\nexistance last year and times are hard\nindeed. I expect the O's to take the\npoints.\nGame of the day: Spurs vs Forest.\n26 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Skeletons in the closet\nTracing your family\ntree can be a rewarding pastime\nand can be likened\nto doing a jigsaw\npuzzle. So is it\nworth the time and\neffort to check\nthrough pages of\nrecords just to find\nout when Great\nAunt so-and-so got\nmarried.\nHave you ever wondered who your\nancestors were and what they did? It\nis possible to find out a great deal of\ninformation, and it is an interesting\ninsight into the recent past. Starting\nfrom scratch can be quite daunting,\nyet with persistence slowly but surely\nthe branches can be found and the\nroots dug up.\nTo start with it is best to gather as\nmuch information as you can from\nliving relatives, and family documents\n(there may be a family bible, so dig\nout the loft). After doing this\nconstruct the best family tree you can,\neven with just approximate dates.\nTo proceed further you will need\nto consult external records. There are\nseveral sources of genealogical\ninformation including church\nregisters, census returns and the\npublic records. From July 1837 all\nbirths, marriages and deaths in\nEngland and Wales have been\nregistered; Scottish civil registration\nbegan in 1855 and Irish in 1864.\nChurch records are usually the most\neasily reached as most have been\ndeposited in your local county or\ndistrict archives which are usually\nfree to visit. Almost all denominations\nare covered, although it does\ncomplicate matters if your forebears\nchanged church, or were married,\nbaptised or buried in their local\nchurch or chapel.\nMost of the older records suffer\nfrom bad handwriting and horribly\nornate copper plate scrawls, so\npatience is needed to look slowly\nthrough the records. This way it is\npossible, when armed with only alM2 ii) COP* i;!i. l NISY O.!T:... sTi]\nsmall amount of information, to find\nyour ancestors. Be prepared for\nsurprises\u2014there are almost bound to\nbe a few skeletons in the cupboard,\nand you may be surprised at how\nrecently people were still unable to\nsign their own names on documents.\nAlong the way you will meet other\npeople doing the same thing as you\nare, and often they have tips from\nmany years' experience. There are no\nsuch things as hard and fast rules in\nthis game, but beware of short cuts\nand be as accurate as you can, for it\nis easy to get lost down a false track.\nHowever, eventually you may hit a dead-end, for instance if a person\nmoved into an area from an unknown\norigin. In this case it is worth\nchecking the public records. The\nEnglish and Welsh ones are now held\nin St Catherine's House, Kingsway\nWC2. The general public can check\nthe indices which give approximate\ndates and places of events. To obtain\nactual copies of the certificates you\nhave to pay (\u00a35 if you go there, look\nin the relevant index and fill out the\nform yourself; it is much more if you\nsend in requests by post). Thus to\nbuild up the family tree this way could\nprove to be very expensive, hence it\nshould be used more as a last resort.\nThe Scottish records are held in the\nGeneral Register House, Princes\nStreet, Edinburgh.\nOther sources of information\ninclude copies held by the Mormons\nwhich can be consulted free of charge\nin their Chapel on Exhibition Road.\nThe ten yearly censuses can provide\nuseful evidence and these can be\nexamined at your county or district\narchives (but only for your area) or,\nfor the whole of Great Britain, at the\nLand Registry Building in Portugal\nStreet\u2014just round the corner from St\nCatherine's House. The staff are very\nhelpful and photocopies of the records\nheld on microfilm can be obtained at\n70pa time. This way approximate\nages, professions and approximate\nplaces of birth can be obtained. It is\ndifficult to check the censuses taken\nafter 1881 due to the 100 year rule\nof confidentiality, although direct\ndescendents can obtain information\nfrom the 1891 and 1901 censuses\nfrom St Catherine's House for a fee.\nOther possible records worth\nchecking out, although not as useful,\nare the register of (post 1858) wills\nheld at Somerset House, Electoral\nregisters (although universal suffer age is only comparatively recent so only\na few (rich) ancestors can be found\nthis way), court proceedings and\nHearth Tax returns. Also worth\nchecking are the records of mines, or\ncompanies where your forebears\nworked.\nAfter a while a pattern will emerge\nand you will begin to pick up\ndetective-like techniques which will\nincrease your efficiency. It is often\nuseful to regard each find with\nsuspicion and ask yourself whether\nthe person has exactly the right name,\nis about the right age and comes from\nthe region you expect.\nThere are numerous books printed\nabout the subject and there is bound\nto be a local group, possibly at your\nlocal library, so it could be something\nto do to prevent boredom this\nSummer.\nFELIX Wednesday 23rd March 1988 19\n\n"

ASTMS\nspokesman John Fecamp told FELIX\nyesterday that he was 'concerned that\na resource of the College was not\nnecessarily being put to the best use'.\nMr Fecamp is unhappy that the\nTechnology Transfer Centre is not\nproviding as much 'transfer of\nthought' as he believes it should but\nis instead being let out to private\ncompanies to derive income.\nMr Smith told FELIX that College\nwas making around \u00a3100,000 each\nyear as clear profit from renting out\nspace in the Silwood Science Park\nwhich was enabling more\ndevelopment work to take place at\nSilwood. He said that he saw the need\nfor more communication but that\n'unions have no role' in the Science\nPark. He is concerned that the\nCollege unions don't appreciate that\nthe Science Park is business.\nThe new committee will have no\npowers but it is hoped that all\nconcerned parties will be able to have\na say in what is happening in Silwood.\nThe IC Union President was also\ninvited to attend the meeting, and\nalthough he didn't, it is hoped that\nthere will also be student\nrepresentatives on the new committee.\nLondon\nblack spot The EEC should recognise London as\na 'priority area of economic and social\nneed'; according to a delegation\nwhich arrived in Brussels on Monday.\nThe delegation comprises the leaders\nof the fifteen labour boroughs and the\nInner London Education Authority.\nAlthough London's areas of high\nunemployment are amongst the worst\nin the European Community, it is not\na designated development region as\nare Belfast and Naples. The EEC has\nfunded training schemes as well as\ninvesting several million pounds in\ntechnology research funding in the\ncapital, so is likely to resist the\ndelegation's proposals for more\nspending.\nThe proposals include special\nmeasures to help the employment and\ntraining of women and young people\nwith support for an expanded poverty\nprogramme.\nTory row\nA row about the sabbatical elections\nat Kings College is still running, long\nafter most students have forgotten that\nthey ever took place. Five right-wing\nConservatives were disqualified for\nallegedly forging three of their twenty\nnominating signatures.\nThe Students' Union then began\ndisciplinary proceedings against the\ntories, but none of them turned up to\nthe hearing which had to be\nadjourned. The Union then sent\nregistered post letters to them but on\nthe second date the same thing\nhappened. The Disciplinary\nCommittee has now referred the\nmatter to the Principal.\nThe Blue Ox Babes played the Union Lounge last Friday to a small but\nappreciative audience. The Babes have been receiving a great deal of press\ncoverage recently following the release of their latest single.\nMerger\nThe Councils of the Central School\nof Art and Design and St Martins\nSchool of Art have decided to agree\nto a merger despite bitter opposition\nfrom both student unions.\nFlood\nThe Union's Print Unit was severely\nflooded over the weekend following\nheavy overnight rainfalls.

The Bishop, nicknamed\n'Soapy Sam' on account of his verbal\nskills, addressed the audience first\nusing eloquent arguments to dismiss\nDarwin's The Origin of Species.\nDespite winning the audience over,\nhe could not, however, resist a direct\nattack at Huxley, asking, 'Is it on his\ngrandfather's or his grandmother's side that the ape ancestry comes in?'\nWhile this may have served to\nridicule Huxley it also justified 'the\nsevere is t retort' that Huxley could\ndevise. After waiting for quiet,\nHuxley began to speak. In closing he\nlaunched his counter-attack, 'No man\nshould be ashamed of having an ape\nfor his grandfather. If there were an\nancestor whom I should feel shame\nin recalling it would rather be a man\u2014a man of restless and versatile\nintellect\u2014who, not content with an\nequivocal success in his own sphere\nof activity, plunges into scientific\nquestions with which he has no real\nacquaintance, only to obscure them by\nan aimless rhetoric, and distract the\nattention of his hearers from the real\npoint at issue by eloquent digressions\nand skilled appeals to religious\nprejudice.'\nThe effect was, apparently,\ntremendous with one lady fainting,\nanother leaping from her chair and an\novation to rival the Bishop's.fl NO rt\u00abVONe. WH C HTTlZARO\" WIL U PfiOBASLVJ\nRadar, Jets and Bouncing Bomb\nSir Henry Tizard (1885-1959)\nRector (1929-42)\nReading any biography of Tizard, one\ncan easily get the impression that he\nsingle-handedly defeated Nazi\nGermany. And, indeed, his\ncontribution to Britian's war effort\nwas incredible by any standards.\nIn the First World War Tizard\nserved with the Royal Flying Corps,\nworking on bomb sights and testing\nnew aeroplanes. After the war, he\nwas involved in research on internal\ncombustion engines, becoming Rector\nof IC in 1929. As Rector he secured\nthe money for Beit Hall, and also\nensured that the land north of Imperial\nInstitute Road would be used\nexclusively for education, with\nmuseums to the south.\nIn 1933 as chairman of the\nAeronautic Research Csmmittee he\nworked with PMS Blackett on\ndetecting enemy aircraft with radio\nbeams and tracking them to allow\nfighters to intercept. By 1939 Britain\nhad a network of radar stations that\nwas to prove crucial to her defence\nin the war. Also in this year, Tizard\nsecured uranium ore for British\nresearch into a nuclear weapon and\nsome for Prof GP Thomson (son of\nIJ Thomson) at IC. His other\noutstanding achievements of this\nperiod included his support of Sir\nFrank Whittle in developing the jet\n;ng in e; his efforts in winning\nAmerican sympathy and, more\nimportantly, technical support in\n1940, and his encouragement of sir\nBarnes Wallis' dam-busting bomb.\nTizard later described Wallis'\nbouncing bomb as the 'finest\nindividual technical achievement of\nthe war'.\n12 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Revi\nFILM,\nThrow Momma From The\nTrain\nDanny De Vito's last two films Tin\nMen and Ruthless People displayed\ntwo extremes of comedy. In Ruthless\nPeople, anything was allowed as long\nas it got a laugh, and it was quite\nbrilliantly over-the-top. Barry\nLevinson's Tin Men was a much\ngentler comedy, which extracted its\ncomedy from real people in real\nsituations (in this case it was\naluminium sidings salesmen in the\nfifties). Throw Momma From The\nTrain is pitched somewhere in\nbetween the two, with a man's attempts to kill his mother, after\nhaving been inspired by a Hitchcock\nmovie, supplying the unreal element,\nwhile De Vito and Billy Crystal\n(better known as Joey out of Soap)\nplay real people.\nDe Vito plays Owen Lift, a man as\nemotionally stunted as he is\nphysically, since he is still looking\nafter his witch of a mother (a terrifying performance from Anne\nRamsey). The gargoyle-like mother\nstill bosses and hits Owen like a child,\nand his only escape are the essays he\nwrites for his weekly English class,\nin which he fanta sises about\nmurdering his mother, but he can\nnever bring himself to do it.\nHis English teacher (Billy Crystal)\nalso has someone he would like to\nmurder. His ex-wife stole his first\nnovel, which has turned out to be a best-seller and he's suffering from\nwriter's block, while she's laughing\nall the way to the bank.\nCrystal advises De Vito to go and\nsee a Hitchcock film, in order to\nimprove his attempt at thriller writing.\nDe Vito sees Stranger on a Train, in\nwhich two men swap murders, and,\nknowing of Crystal's wishes, takes his\nsuggestion too literally and goes off\nto murder his wife, hoping that\nCrystal will murder his mother.\nDe Vito's directorial debut is a pleasing if not side-splitting, comedy,\nin which he shows some nice touches\nand a steady hand. The film, however\nis not quite consistently funny in order\nto keep the momentum going. The\nphotography is well structured and\nneatly parodies some Hitchcock\nscenes, but the drabness of the colours\nsometimes makes the plot-line of\nmatricide more morbid than comic.\nBilly Crystal is never quite\nsatisfactory as the weak-willed\nteacher, despite some good scenes.\nHowever, having said this, the film\nhas some great gags and De Vito\nexcellently plays the mild-mannered\nOwen, who, in his naivety, can't see\nwhat's wrong with murdering his\nmother. (But after seeing her in\naction, neither could I). The film is\nworth seeing for Ramsey's performance alone, which is a combination of all the faults of every\nmother. I initially thought that\nshowing a preview of such a film on\nMothers' Day was sublimely sick, but\nOwen's mother only made me\nappreciate mine all the more.\nNoel Curry\nOrphans\nOrphans is a beautiful film dealing\nwith themes fo parentage, family\nlove, anger and the control of\na gres sion. Director Alan J Pakula\nflicks between moods of hilarity,\ndespair, affection and - fear\neffortlessly. Treat (Matthew Modine)\nand Philip (Kevin Anderson) are a couple of dead-end kids living in\nNewark in a shack of a house\nresembling Bate's motel. Philip is\nhousebound for fear of the outdoors\nand Treat supports them by stealing\n(an occupation for which he has a flair). Treat is master over his\nyounger brother, treating him like a pet dog. Philip seems to emphasize\nthis; he is like a frightened animal,\ncrawling like a monkey.\nTheir world is changed irrevocably\nby the appearance of drunken\ngangster Harold (Albert Finney) who\nTreat hopes to hold for ransom. The\ntables are swiftly turned and Harold\nsets about taming the two brothers.\nHarold represents different things\nto each of them. There are tender\nmoments when he gives Philip the\nencouragement he has always needed;\nhe hugs his shoulders, lets him feel\nthe rain for the first time on his face\nand watches him venture for the first\ntime into the outside world clutching\na map of Newark. To Treat he is a teacher, showing him how to behave\nand how to control his violent temper.\nBut to both of them he is a father who\nthey love and for whom they express\ngrief when he is gone.\nAlbert Finney is superb, bringing\nout the range in Harold's character\nbe liev ably. Matthew Modine is a suitably angry young man with an\ninnocent streak and Kevin Anderson\nmakes the transition from caged pet\nto independence a joy to watch.\nSteve Roberts.\nBaby Boom\nBaby Boom is the kind of film you\nexpect to hate and are embarrassed to\nadmit that you actually enjoyed. It is\nthe first of a clutch of films about\nbabies soon to be released in this\ncountry and continues the trend\ntowards the s trag ht forward, good\nclean fun type of romantic/domestic\ncomedies which are appearing at an\never-increasing rate (a la Roxanne,\nNadine and Blind Date)\nIt mixes a typically eighties issue,\nthat of the career woman in the\nbusiness of high finance, with the\nfarcical potential of a13 month old\nbaby left on the proverbial doorstep.\nThe result is similar in many ways to\nthe Hollywood 'crazy comedies' of\nthe thirties and forties which\nconcerned the privileged classes doing\nc racy things. It's the kind of thing\nCary Grant and Katherine Hepburn\nmight have starred in.\nAt first the look of the film is\nclassic, based heavily on the best of\ntwentieth century fashion and design;\nJC Wiatt (Diane Keaton) works in\nNew York in a skyscraper designed\nby the modernist Miers van der Raoke\nand lives in a chic art deco apartment\nbuilding with a Corbusier furniture\nsuite and a Lichtenstein on the wall.\nThe impression is of class and style\nwith no warmth, just like JC's life (it\ntakes her and her live-in lover just\nfour minutes to make love. Enough\ntime to boil an egg).\nHowever, the texture changes when\nshe decides to quit the New York rat\nrace and move, with baby Elizabeth,\ninto her dream country farmhouse in\npicturesque Vermont, all patchwork\nquilts and Mom's app lie pie type\nstuff. Here the style is quite different;\nJC has been brought down to earth\nfrom her skyscrapers to a cozy kind\nof snow covered existence in the\ncountry, reminding one of White\nChristmas and other such sentimental\nold films.\nThe cast are excellent, giving their\ncharacters the warmth and humanity\nto elevate this from an embarrassment\nof a film into something quite\nwatch able. They comprise oscar\nwinner Diane Keaton, Pulitzer prize\nwining playwright Sam Shepard,\nHarold Ramis who co-wrote National\nLampoon's Animal House and\nGhostbusters, and Sam Wanamaker\nwhose project to recreate\nShakespeare's Globe Theatre is\ncurrently under construction.\nThe plot can be predicted before the\nopening credits have finished.\nNevertheless Baby Boom does have\na kind of message, outlined by Keaton\nin a meeting: 'It's possible for\nsomeone to have a full filling career\nas well as a satisfying family life'.\nSteve Roberts.\n28 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Policy warning\nDear Judith,\nI have read with interest the brief article on page 16\nof FELIX 798 regarding the two 'con-women' operating\nin the Evelyn Gardens residences. It has since come to\nour notice that some of those approached are Mining\nHouse residents and so I 've carried out certain\ninvestigations of my own.\nThe service being promoted is a life assurance policy\nwith Premium Assurance Company and the company\ninvolved is Royston Financial Services (in association with\nGenn Financial Services Ltd.). This company has its\nheadquarters in London and another office in Manchester.\nThe women operating in Evelyn Gardens are apparently\nfrom the Manchester office.\nAfter enquiries from students. contacted the\nheadquarters and spoke to one Ms Rosemary Genn. She\noutlined salient points of the agreement, but there seems\nto be a difference on two key issues. Firstly, contrary to\nwhat seems to have been advised to IC students, the policy\nis designed to run for ten plus years and not five plus\nyears. Secondly, access to the investment is not possible\nafter three years (as said by these women) but only after\nmuch longer. Ms Genn could only attribute this apparent\ndisparity to some misunderstanding on the part of the\nManchester office and has promised to check up on it.\nAlso, when Royston Financial Services does notify clients\nfrom Evelyn Gardens about the receipt of their\napplications, Ms Genn has volunteered to include an\nadd i tonal note stating the actual conditions.\nFrom further enquiries of another investment consultant,\nI gather that such an approach to selling insurance policies\nis not unique. However, it is difficult to say whether these\npolicies are authentic or fakes. I can only suggest that all\nthose who have applied consider seriously the implications\nof the investment being much more long term than was\nput to them. Ms Genn is expecting enquiries from Imperial\nCollege students on this topic and I recommend that anyone\nwith doubts in their minds should contact her at the\nfollowing address: Ms Rosemary Genn, Royston Financial\nServices, c/o GFS Ltd, Equity House, 65 Trinity Road,\nLondon N22 4XX( Tel: 01-889 9451); do remember to\nstate that you are from IC.\nSincerely yours,\nBharat I Chaudhary, Subwarden, Mining House.\nMisrepresenting the facts?\nDear Judith,\nMr Nelkon's letter 'Answering the opinion' was, to say\nthe least, interesting. Not only did the letter lack\nobjectivity, logic and sensitivity to the plight of the\nPalestinians, but it contained a great deal of\nmisrepresentation of facts.\nFirstly, it is clear to any detached observer that Israel\noccupied, not entered as Mr Belkon wishes us to believe,\nthe West Bank and Gaza strip in 1967. This 'benevolent'\noccupation has resulted in the imprisonment of tens of\nthousands of inhabitants, most of these being detained\nwithout trial, the deportation of over 2,000 Palestinians\nfrom their own land as a punishment for opposing Israel's continued occupation, the destruction of, at least, 20,000\nhomes belonging to Palestinians and standing on land\nwhich is rightfully theirs, the illegal expropriation of\nthousands of acres of Arab land for the purpose of\nestablishing illegal Jewish settlements. One must\nacknowledge however, that Israel has given a number of\nPalestinian families plots of land with 99 year leases, with\nno electricity, no roads, no mosques and certainly no\nschools.\nSecondly, it is clear that Mr Nelkon ignores the Ribat,\n1974, and the Fass, 1982, summits where the PLO\nchairman Arafat stated that he, as spokesman for the\nPalestinian people, will declare the right of the state of\nIsrael to exist and will support the existence of a two state\nsettlement, living in peace, provided Israel accepts the\nPLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people,\nthe right of the Palestinians to a state of their own in the\noccupied territories. This was categorically rejected by\nIsrael. This policy of rejection has been most recently\ndemonstrated by Mr Shamir's rebuff al of the Shultz 'land\nfor peace' initiative.\nThirdly, Mr Nelkon's figure of '8,000 acts of terror'\nwhich he claims to have been carried out by the PLO seems\na bit ludicrous. As Mr Nelkon surely knows the PLO was\nestablished in 1965 (ie 23 years ago) and for this\norganisation to carry out such a number of acts, this would\nentail at least six acts of terror every week. Mr Nelkon\nwho are you kidding? No one could or would condone\nacts of terror were they carried out in the Middle East\nor elsewhere in the world. However would any person\nconsider the massacre of 5000 civilians, including women,\nchildren and elderly people, an act of terror? The answer\nwould surely be yes. As you well know, the Israeli army\nknowingly allowed such an abominable act to take place\nin the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps (Lebanon 1982).\nWould you consider the bombing of civilians in several\nLebanese cities, by the Israeli air force, resulting in the\ndeath of some 1,000 people and the injury of over 5,000\nothers an act of terror? Surely the answer would be yes\nagain. These unrequited, unmitigated and unjustifiable acts\nwere carried out over the period 1976-1982 and preceding\nIsrael's invasion of the Lebanon, which resulted in the\nfurther deaths of thousands of innocent civilians. Or would\none not consider the Deir Yassin massacre and the King\nDavid hotel bombing acts of terror? Thus Mr Nelkon I do not think your argument that the PLO is a terrorist\norganisation holds ground when faced with today's reality\nof, Israeli politics, where members of past terrorist\norganisations, such as the Irgun Zwei Leumi, currently\nhold the highest positions in the Israeli-political structure.\nFinally, Mr Nelkon's claim that the 'distressing cases\nof brutality by Israeli soldiers are breaches of and represent\nthe antithesis of Israeli government policy' seems a bit\nodd in the face of Mr Rabin's declared policy of 'might,\npower and beatings', a policy which replaced an earlier,\nbut not less brutal, 'shoot to kill' policy administered in\nthe occupied territories.\nYours sincerely,\nM Bulbul, Mech Eng 2.\nShocked\nDear Judith,\nYou can imagine my surprise when some of Mr\nShanley's tips actually won this week, that is all except\nthe one I backed which lost by a 'short neck'.

Watch out Linstead and\nFisher.\nNot misleading\nDear FELLX,\nWith reference to Matthew Huntbach's letter (FELIX\n798) concerning his views on the Christian Union, I would\nlike to make a few points which, I feel, might remove\nsome misunderstanding:\n1. The name 'Christian Union' is in no way misleading\nas it implies a group of Christians united in their belief\nand active in their relationship with God.\n2. Christianity, as practiced by the CU, is based truly\nand firmly on a belief in Jesus Christ. The Bible, not as\n'some obscure jumble' but as the inspired word of God,\nis of immense importance in understanding Christ and\nfollowing Him more effectively.\n3. The most important protestant belief is not exclusive\nand that is that salvation is available to all who\nacknowledge Christ as their Lord and Saviour and that,\nthrough Christ, we may enjoy a fulfilled relationship with\nGod and Father.\n4. 'Justification of faith alone' is not a protestant belief.\nJustification by faith, however, is a widely held Christian\nview (Romans 5:1). This by no means does away with\nChrist's teaching on the poor, on morality etc. Indeed St\nPaul says: 'Do we then nullify the Law through faith? On\nthe contrary, we establish the Law.' (Romans 3:31).\n5. No one I know would ever suggest Mother Theresa\nwas destined for Hell\u2014the suggestion is quite\npreposterous.\nI make these points, not to attack personally views or\nbeliefs held by Mr Huntbach, but merely to correct what\nI felt was a misrepresentation of the conduct of our\nChristian Union. I hope, and indeed pray, that Imperial\nCollege will see the value of this society and therefore treat\nthem in a respectful way in the future.\nYours sincerely,\nLove and God Bless,\nRoger Morris (President of Methodist Society).\nOh so vicious\nDear Judith,\nI would like to ask you for an explanation for your\nunwarranted and vicious attack on Bill Goodwin (Editorial,\nFELIX 797). I congratulate you on your subtle ness( for\nexample, not even mentioning his name), but the fact\nremains that it was an unjustified and callous slur on Bill.\nAs it is no secret that Bill was not your preferred candidate,\nthis looks like yet another episode in the long-running saga\nof 'Judith-Hackney-using-her-editorial-to-slag-off-people-she-doesn't like'.\nFor the benefit of those who don't know what I'm referring to, I am objecting first of all to the fact that Bill\nwas not mentioned in your editorial as having been elected\nFELIX Editor. I know that you have told us all a million\ntimes that what you put in FELIX, and especially in your\neditorial, is completely up to you; however, it seems\nwrong to me to list all the winners except for the one you\ndidn't like. More importantly, however, I'm objecting to\nthe scurrilous accusations in the right-hand column of your\neditorial, under the subheading of FELIX. In it, you accuse\nBill of standing for the post of FELIX Editor solely to\nfurther his own journalistic career. As if that wasn't enough, you then proclaim that, under his leadership, your\nso-called 'FELIX spirit' will be gone. To top it all off,\nyou then announce that FELIX is dead. That may well\nbe so. However, you've still got one full term to res uci tate it, Judith, and even if you don't manage it I have every\nconfidence that Bill Goodwin will.\nYours sincerely,\nAlastair Seymour, Assiduous FELLX reader.\nYou seem to have read into my editorial all the things\nwhich I didn't say. You merely assume that your\nconclusions are what I intended to imply. As I said,\nunless you have worked on FELIX for several years,\nnot just my year, you will not understand the spirit.\nI must say, though, that I am looking forward to\nreading FELIX next year. It will be an amazing paper\nif Bill manages to carry out all his election promises.\nGuilds' agony\nDear Judith 'Deidre' Hackney,\nI really am very sorry to bother you with my problems,\nbut there really is no one else I feel I can turn to. Over\nthe last few months, I have become very close to this guy,\nand on a recent night out, we went a little too far, and\nbefore I knew what was happening, he took advantage\nof me. It was my first time, and I found it understandably\ndifficult to walk the next day. Since that night, he has\nchosen to ignore me, and I feel so cheap and used.\nHowever, I still love him, but I imagined that sooner or\nlater my feelings for him would fade. Unfortunately, we\nhave now both been chosen as editors for Guildsheet, and\nI am afraid that my feelings will get in the way of my\ndoing my job well. (After all, I know how hard Mr Tyler\nfound it to work with Mr Baker.) What do you think I should do Judith? I am at my wits end and cry myself to\nsleep every night. Do you think that I should face him\nand tell him my feelings? Please, please help.\nYours faithfully,\nCP.\nWell, luv vy. I can understand what an unfortunate\nsituation you have found yourself in. Men are callous,\nheartless b* st*rds, aren't they? I think you ought to\nconfront you feelings and your man. Tell him\neverything and if he tells you where to go, castrate him.\n'UV2Z & :rd ck C1TJB\nPRESENTS THE\nHOP n23 MARCH UNION LOWER LOUNGE WITH\nxh:e GENTS SCECROIZDIHGXP/S C&3t MOCK OTCIKS\n& SUPPORT50 ON THE DOOR: DOORS OPEN 7:30\nFELIX Wednesday 23rd March 1988 37\n\n"

Further\ndetails about the meeting place for\nauditions, and the productions to be\npresented this summer will be posted\naround College (look out on the\nwalkway!) and appear in FELIX at\nthe beginning of next term.\nThose people who are cast in the\nTheatre West End repertory\nproductions would have to ensure that\nthey are available in London during\nJuly (rehearsals are in the evenings),\nand would have to keep the month of\nAugust free for the Festival. It is a commitment, but the vast majority of\nthose who have made that\ncommitment in previous years would\nagree that it is worthwhile, as\nparticipating in the Festival is a rewarding and memorable\nexperience.\nSo, if you are interested in taking\npart in the Edinburgh Festival this\nsummer (as a performer, or\notherwise), then make a note in your\ndiary of May 1st and May 4th. And\nremember\u2014these auditions are open\nto everybody: You don't have to be\na member of Dramsoc. Everyone is\nwelcome to audition and stands a fair\nchance of being cast.\nWatch this space for further details.\nVanessa Dodge,\nTheatre West End Repertory\nProductions.\nFELIX\nAt the end of this week the 26\nresidents of Rayleigh House will be\nmoving out for the Easter vacation\nand for good.\nThe House which is situated in\nQueensbury Place, just opposite the\nNatural History Museum, has\nrecently been sold by the College to\npay for renovations to Fisher Hall, the\nnew property in Evelyn Gardens,\npurchased last year from the Royal\nCollege of Art.\nRayleigh House was originally\nbought in 1968 and named after The\nFourth Baron Lord Rayleigh FRS, the\nChairman of the Governing Body of\nImperial College (1936-47)\nBeing such a small community, the\natmosphere within Rayleigh is one of\nthe friendliest and warmest of all the\nCollege Houses and it is with great\nsadness and reluctance that the present\nresidents are leaving. Many previous\nresidents have also expressed their\nsorrow at the sale.\nThe House was originally to be sold\nlast summer, but this idea was shelved\nbecause the renovation work on\nFisher Hall was taking longer than\nexpected and there were not enough\nrooms ready for the 1987-88 intake.\nConsequently this has meant that the\nstudents in Rayleigh must move in the\nmiddle of the academic year,\ndisrupting the third year re-applicants\njust before their finals.\nMost of the residents of Rayleigh\nHouse will be moving to Fisher Hall\nbut a few will be accommodated in\nother Houses and Halls. The Warden\nMark Goldstone is moving to a flat\nin Evelyn Gardens and can be\ncontacted during the day on internal\nextension 4772.\nThe House was to celebrate its 20th birthday this year, but this was\ncancelled because of the sale and it\nis now hoped that a formal event will\nbe held next term to mark the closure\nof the House.\nRachel Fowler (Civ Eng 3),\nRe-Applicant.\nELIX\nCookery Club\nShergar Stew\nServes 6 normal people or 4 pigs.\n2 lb stewing beef\n2 level tbs flour\n3 oz butter\n1 onion (finely chopped)\n2 cloves garlic (crushed)\n4 oz carrots (thick sliced)\n2 oz celery (chopped)\n2 oz turnips (cut into chunks)\nSome grated nutmeg\n14 tsp powdered allspice\n4 pints Guinness\nSalt and pepper\nPre-heat the oven to gas mark Vi,\n2 5 0 \u00b0 F,130 \u00b0C.

The\ngame was started after a random\nwithout a whistle volunteered to\nreferee.\nRCS quickly took hold of the game\ndominating most of the loose ball.\nThe first points were scored from a kicked penalty. Th^; first try came\nfrom a back row linking move which\nleft M Manning with a few yards to\nrun to score. Much of the game RCS\nwere hampered by deliberate bloch ing and offside tactics by their opponents.\nThe resulting frustration only spurred\nthe team on further. Dobson was\nquantum tunnelling his way through\ntheir pack and won much line out ball.\nThe score did not progress further\nuntil the second half when when B Evans stumbled over the line. Many\nopportunities were not taken, the\nworst occurred when Manning\ntripped over his ego when clear. A much improved RCS side conti nute d to put pressure on, not deterred when\nthe extraordinary fat person had the\nball.\nINDOOR CRICKET\nCalling p gsI am interested in organising a limited-over knockout, or round\nrobin, indoor cricket tournament for\nPGs during the Easter holidays in the\nVolleyball Courts.\nFormat:\n1. 10-15 overs per side.\n2. 6 persons per side.\n3.

PGs at IC do so very little\ntogether so I hope many of you will\nsi eze this opportunity.\ni CROSSCOUNTRY A term of running\nWell folks, despite what you thought\nthe Cross-Country Club didn't die at\nthe end of last term. Gary Hart may\nhave pulled out of the US presidential\nelections due to leg-over problems but\nwe've had an injury-free season!\nIn a very active term so far we've\nbeen as far afield as Nottingham,\nthree times (who's that girl Dil?),\nLeicester and just about everywhere\nin London. The highlight of the term\nwas undoubtedly the Hyde Park\nRelays hosted by ourselves, and is the\nbiggest student relay in Europe.\nThe first race of the term was a friendly against Hercules Wimbledon.\nThe race was wc by Phil O 'Brien,\nwho is an Olympic 'a rath on runner,\nwhich begs the ques; n what were we\ndoing there? E\\: so notable\nperformances for iC came from\nHubert SH, Trevor S and Stuart B. Our first trip to Nottingham was for\nthe British Universities\nchampionships. In a highly\ncompetitive race superstar Dave\nKnight only managed a top 200\nplacing but everyone's performances\nwere up to scratch. This included\nWimpey who added to his reputation\ngained at last year's Hyde Park Relays\nwhen he was again hospitalised after\nthe race.\nIn the London Colleges League\ncongratulations are in order as our\nfirst team kept up their good\nperformances from last term to finish\na strong third. We were in fact the\nfirst London College as the League\nwas won by Thames Polytechnic with\nOxford Polytechnic in second place.\nThis creditable result was brought\nabout by good performances and good\nturnouts at Trent Park, Parliament\nHill Fields (and possibly Richmond\nPark). We would have taken third\nplace one race earlier had Stuart B not\ndecided to do an extra lap at Trent\nPark losing 50 places! Not even your\numbrella could help this time Stuart!\nThe final position of our top six\nrunners after six races and out of a total of 280 competitors were as\nfollows:\n11th Alex Gaskell\n18th Dave Knight\n22nd John H Porter\n29th Hubert Schulte-Huxel\n44th John Rowland\n49th Ramin Dilmaghanian\nThe Richmond Park Race which is\norganised by us saw Tim Butler of\nSurrey winning his first and much\ndeserved league race after many\nattempts. Hubert (our German\nimport) and Alex led our forces home\nfinishing 20th and 24th. My heart\nbleeds for the lady runner who took\na nose dive into one of the many\npuddles on the course. We fielded our\nstrongest ladies team of the year.\nAlison Horrocks our lady oriente er was 24th and Pam Samson 28th. The last race in the League was\nheld at Parliament Hill on a surprisingly dry course. Trevor,\ndespite trying to spike himself again\nstormed to a good 16th place. He was\nclosely followed by Hubert and\ncaptain Hugh. Thanks to everyone\nwho took part in the League.\nOur honour was at stake in the\nHyde Park Relays. The oriente ers threw down the gauntlet and\nchallenged us to a private race within\nthe race. I'm pleased to say that we\nsaw off not only the oriente ers but\nalso the old boys team, led by our\nfitter-than-ever former secretary\nGavin Waterson. Even our second\nteam held off the oriente ers! The\nladies team fought courageously but\nhad to settle for a lesser placing in a truly high class race. The paramedics\nhad a peaceful day since Wimpey\ndecided not to collapse this year. Our\nstar performer on the day was Hubert\nbut everyone did well.\nA few of us participated in the\nNational Cross Country\nChampionships, would you believe it,\nin Nottingham. The younger lads,\nDave and Alex ran the junior race\nwhich was won convincingly by\nSimon Hugglestone. Dil ran the\n9-mile senior race and easily won the\ncontest for the muddiest appearance.\nOur finishing positions, withheld by\nrequest, may have been far down the\nlist but it should be remembered that\nthe cream of the English crosscountry runners took part.\nOne week later Nottingham\nUniversity staged their annual relay\non a2 mile plus course around the\ncampus, with two gruelling hills. IC\nold boy Gavin ran a blinding leg in\n13:14 but Hubert and Trevor were\nclose behind. Energetic Hubert\ndecided that one leg wasn't enough so\nran another leg just for fun! The\nresults were not known at the time of\nwriting.\nFinally the club AGM will be at\n5.00pm on Wednesday March 23.\nMore details on the noticeboard.\n32 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Features\nOPINION\nA Question of Faith\nIt can hardly have escaped your\nnotice, on reading the last few issues\nof FELIX, that the Christian Union\n(CU) has been having a 'spot of\nbother\". But why, after over sixty\nyears, have the Union decided not to\nrecognise the CU.\nThe Union by-laws state that full\nICU members 'shall be entitled to the\nuse of all facilities and amenities\nprovided by the Union'. This has been\ninterpreted to mean that any student\nmay join any club or society. The CU\nasks members to sign a statement of\nfaith, and committee members to sign\na doctrinal basis (the belief on which\nthe CU is founded) thus the CU's constitution is seen as unconstitutional\nand the CU was expelled from the\nUnion. (The ambiguous clause\nregarding speakers (FELIX 798) will\nbe changed at the forthcoming EGM.)\nPerhaps the CU is badly named. It\nappears to give the impression that we\nbelieve we represent all Christians.\nHowever we are fully aware of the\ndiversities within the Christian faith.\nWe encourage those who do not fit\ncomfortably into our society to find\na society in which they feel more at\nhome. Our own individuality from\nother Christian societies is protected\nby our doctrinal basis. This ensures\nthat there is always a society in which\nindividuals can find a group of\nChristians with whom they feel\ncomfortable. For some this will be the\nCU, for others the Chaplaincy, for\nothers Cathsoc or Methsoc. And we\ndo not presume to judge those who\ndo not feel their place is with us.\nThere are a number of reasons why\nI feel that an exception to the by-laws\nshould have been made in the case of\nthe CU (or the by-laws changed).\nFirstly, the CU is not a 'closed\nsociety'. Everyone is welcome to\ncome and listen to and discuss what\nhas been said (hence the 50 posters\ndistributed around College to\nadvertise each event). So, in this\nsense, the CU is open to all ICU\nmembers. I made many friends, and\nhad an active part in the CU Physics\nBible Study Group for nearly a year\nbefore becoming a CU member. This\nyear membership cards weren't distributed until nearly three weeks\ninto the Autumn term, by which time\nstudents had seen what we were\nabout, and could decide whether or\nnot they wanted to join. Interaction\nwith other Christian societies in\nCollege is high, many members of the\nCU are members of other groups and\nthe CU president meets once a term\nwith the student leaders of the other\nChristian societies.\nSo why the membership clause? It\nensures continuity, thus preserving\nthe character of the CU; and is\nnecessary for affiliation to our\nClause 4. THE DOCTRINAL BASIS\nThe doctrinal basis of the Union shall be the fundamental\ntruths of Christianity as revealed in Holy Scripture, including:\na) The unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit in\nthe Godhead.\nb) The sovereignty of God in creation, revelation,\nredemption and final judgement.\nc) The divine inspiration and infallibility of Holy Scripture\nas originally given, and its supreme authority in all\nmatters of faith and conduct.\nd) The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since\nthe fall, rendering mankind subject to God's wrath and\ncondemnation.\ne) The full deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the incarnate\nSon of God, his virgin birth and his real and s in less humanity; his death on the cross, his bodily resurrection\nand his present reign in heaven and earth.\nf) Redemption from the guilt, penalty and power of sin\nonly through the sacrificial death once and for all time\nof our representative and substitute, Jesus Chris, the\nonly mediator between God and man.\ng) Justification as God's act of undeserved mercy, in which\nthe sinner is pardoned all his sins, and accepted as\nrighteous in God's sight, only because of the\nrighteousness of Christ imputed to him, this justification\nbeing received by faith alone.\nSTATEMENT OF FAITH\nI believe in:\n1. The unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit in\nthe Godhead.\n2. Jesus Christ as my Saviour, my Lord and my God.\n3. The divine inspiration of Holy Scripture as originally\ngiven, and its supreme authority in all matters of faith\nand conduct.\nmaternal body, the Universities and\nColleges Christian Fellowship\n(UCCF), which provides us with\nmany (non-financial) resources,1\nwithout which (or whom) we could\nnot function effectively.\nEach year new students join, and\na new committee is elected\u2014without\na membership clause or a doctrinal\nbasis, it is easy to see how the CU\ncould move away from the aims on\nwhich it is based. So in this sense, the\ndoctrinal basis provides continuity\nthrough the years in the same way as\nthe Chaplains do within the\nchaplaincies. Also, without them, in\nextreme (but admittedly unlikely)\ncircumstances, students opposed to\nthe Christian Union could swamp\nmembership and radically change or\ndisband the society. I believe this has\nhappened in the past to Gay Soc, with\ncommittee members being elected\nwho are unsympathetic to gay rights.\nA further analogy can be drawn\nbetween the CU and the orchestra.\nAnyone can join the orchestra; in the\nsame way anyone can come to CU\nmeetings. However, only those who\ncan play an instrument to the required\nstandard will be allowed to perform,\nthus retaining the characteristically\nhigh standard of the orchestra's performances. Likewise by restricting\nthe voting membership and those\neligible for the Committee the\ncharacter of the CU is retained.\nVoting rights are the only difference\nbetween a member and a non-member, all meetings and social\nactivities, as previously stated, remain\nopen to everyone.\nOur affiliation to UCCF is very\nimportant. It provides support for our\nstudent leaders, with advice, training\nand practical help etc, in the same\nway as the student leaders of\nMethsoc, Cathsoc and the WLC are\nassisted by their chaplains.\nI suppose that leaves the question\n'Does IC need a CU?'. I'd say yes-there has been a CU at Imperial since\nat least 1922; the CU has always had\na large membership (this year 50,\nwith many non-members also actively\ninvolved; mainly through\ndepartmental Bible study groups). So\nthere is a call for it.\nBut the Union fears an exception in\nthe case of the CU would give clubs,\nwith their self-elected membership, a 'carte blanche' to become part of ICU\n(FELIX 796). However, drawing\nparallels between religious societies\nand clubs is hardly plausible, even on\nthe grounds of membership clauses.\nBut maybe the relevant ICU by-laws\ncould be changed so that at least\ncommittee members of religious\nsocieties could be required to state\ntheir belief in the views the society\naims to promote.\nWhatever happens to the CU in the\nlong run, the Union will have to\nreview its position or the C&G Motor\nClub will also be out as it excludes\nthose potential members who belong\nto any motoring organisation other\nthan the RAC. This is to retain their\naffiliation to their national body. An\naffiliation which presumably is as\nnecessary to the Motor Club, as\naffiliation to UCCF is for the CU.\nFinally, could the CU survive on\nits own? I think yes, although it will\nbe much more difficult. One third of\nCU's nationally do not belong to their\nstudents' unions. It doesn't seem to\naffect their size, just the students'\npockets (at the University of Sussex\neach CU member gives \u00a310 a term to\nCU funds. At Imperial with our\nmembership, this would have to be\n\u00a315).\nWithin the objects of ICU is 'the\nencouragement of interest by students\nin matters outside the College\ncurriculum, especially cultural and\nathletic interests'.

    "content": "FOOTBALL\nIC Fifths win Cup\nThe victorious Fifths\nThe changing room was strangely\nquiet. Everyone was simply sitting\nthere, gazing in disbelief at their\nmedals. No one at the club had\nexpected the victory, and it was\ndifficult for anyone to have even\naccepted that the fifths had got to the\nfinal, but we had won it...actually\nwon the Cup...\nNormally, the laughter and chirp y conversation would be ringing around\nthe dressing room; win or lose, it\nnever really mattered. Satisfaction\nwas derived from playing as a team,\nfor the team, and that was reward in\nitself. No wonder it felt so odd to have\nsomething tangible, to show our\ngrandchildren, as one cynical member\nof the team pointed out.\nIt had been a long Cup run. When\nwe kicked off at King's College\nHospital all those months ago, no one\nhad the slightest image of the Cup in\ntheir mind. We were without our\ngoalkeeper, but we were used to\nsetbacks. Jon Turner, almost\nnonchalantly donned the green jersey,\nand proceeded quite extraordinarily\nto make a series of outstanding_ saves. We won 2-1, albeit with a goal by\nBassim Basma that could, and should\nhave been disallowed. Ironic perhaps\nthat this was our first victory of any\nsort in the season. The Charing Cross\ngame was a different matter. 3-1 up\nat half-time and, apparently, sailing\nto victory. Yet, with seconds to go we\nfound ourselves 4-3 down. Quite\nfrankly, it felt like it was all over.\nThen out of nowhere, Glenn Evans\npopped up with a shot from over 35\nyards, a dream goal, and we were still\nalive after all. Penalties solved\nnothing. In the replay, the IC defence\ndominated everything. Cruising at\n1-0, then CC&W equalise d with a goal in the last seconds; hand ball as\nwell. Fortune, we thought, had\ndeserted us. In the penalties, the most\nconsistent player, Mike Wilks,\nnormally so unruffled, missed his\nkick. Yet again, as if merely trying\nto unnerve us, Lady Luck returned;\nCC&W missed twice, and Lee\nRoberts calmly placed the winner to\ngrab his moment of glory. The\nquarter-final beckoned.\nThis was without doubt the hardest\nmatch, and for the script writers, they\nchose a day when IC were at their\nbest. The tension at kick-off reached\nnew heights, but it was to be IC's day,\nand Tanwir Ahmed's game. He\nchased, tackled and barged like a man\nknowing his destiny. Inimitably, he\ncrowned the performance with a stunning goal. As if all this wasn't enough, IC somehow let Royal Free\nback into the game. We were not to\nbe denied though, and minutes from\nthe end, Pete Othen rose\nmagnificently to score the winner; a choice occasion indeed for his only\ngoal of the season. At last, it seemed\nthat the team believed they could go\nall the way. The semi-final can only\nbe described as being the most one-sided match imaginable. Steve Von\nBargen marshalled his defence with\nsuch remarkable ease that LSE never\nlooked like getting a shot on goal, let\nalone scoring. Ian Charlton's flair\ndominated the midfield. Yet IC\nstruggled to score and extra time\nbeckoned. The inevitable IC winner,\nwhen it did arrive, was brilliant in its\nown simplicity. Pete Othen's superbly\ntimed pass split the defence, and\nBassim Basma obliged with a delicate\nchip, and IC fifths were now\ndreaming of Motspur Park.\nMarch 5th: IC's handful of\nsupporters almost seemed in awe of\nUCL's coach load of fans. IC froze\nright at the start, UCL scored, 1-0.\nIC then took over. Mike Wilks stole\nin to equalise, and UCL struggled to\nput anything together. Then came\nJohn Bolger's goal. He'd waited a long time for this one, but when the\nchance came, his sweet volley into the\ncorner was a delight, 2-1. UCL threw\neverything at IC in the second half,\nand a very dubious penalty allowed\nthem to equalise. But IC were not to\nbe denied. The ubiquitous Jon Turner\nplayed out of his skin, ably assisted\nby Basher Issa. Bah Tamanji's fresh\nlegs rejuvenated the attack, and in\nextra-time the victory was sealed;\nGlenn Evans' scorching shot\ndeserving to win any final, as to rmer of a goal; 3-2...perhaps it was no\nwonder everyone was in a state of\nshc ok in the dressing room. This\nstrange mix of extrovert jokers had\nactually won the Cup...\nSAILING\nA barrel of\nfun\nOne of the most important events in\nthe Sailing Club calendar is the\nBradford Barrel, which this year took\nplace on March 11 to 13. Due to its\nimportance Friday night included a weigh-in to sort out suitable\ncrew/helm combinations. For the\nheavier members of the team this\nmeant stripping down to the boxer\nshorts.\nSailing began early Saturday\nmorning, in Enterprises and Larks,\nafter a night of social ising with\nmembers of the other ten teams, as\nwell as the compulsory Bradford\ncurry.\nThe first race of the day was against\nour London rivals QMC. With some\nbad timing at the start, IC looked set\nto loose this grudge match. However,\neventually the Lark in second place\nwas one of IC's, giving a win with\n2nd,3 rd and 4th positions.\nLater, in the race against\nEdinburgh, there was active team\nracing before the start. One member\nof the Edinburgh team in particular\nwas determined to take captain\nRichard Jarman out, but in a manoeuvre known as avoiding the\nsharks, he managed to get away. This\nmeant another 2, 3, 4 win for IC.\nSaturday night was again a riotous\nsocial occasion, with team racing\ntactics demonstrated in the night club.\nThis meant the early Sunday morning\nstart was hard for everyone except\nRichard to cope with.\nFrom Saturday's results, it emerged\nthat TCD was the team to beat. IC had\nproblems from the very beginning,\ndue to an unexpected change in start\ntime by the Bradford committee,\nwhich was to TCD's advantage. Bill\nrammed the start line buoy, and Sam\nfollowed this up by banging him after\na few nasty gybes. Ape thought up the\nbrilliant tactic of gybing on to port,\nunfortunately he coli ded with a boat\nwhich appeared from nowhere. Final\nresult: 3, 5, 6.\nApe was again on form in the race\nagainst Manchester, when he hit the\ncommittee boat, started the race last,\nbut excelled himself by finishing first.\nApart from a win against Bradford,\nthe rest of the day proved\nunsuccessful for IC. The Barrel was\nfinally won by TCD and the home\nteam Bradford, lost every race. Due\nto the distance to travel home, we\nwere unable to see where we were\nplaced.\n30 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

As\nreported in FELIX (793), Weeks Hall\nwas earmarked as a new postgraduate\nonly hall following a decision taken\nat the College's Student Residence,\nCommittee (SRC). The use of Weeks\nhad to be subject to the agreement of\nVickers which provided money for its\nconstruction. One of the conditions\nmade by the company was that all\nVickers' sponsored students would be\nguaranteed places in the Hall. The\ncompany, however, is unhappy with\nthe proposal and has told College\nAssistant Secretary Michael Arthur\nverbally that they are in it ally opposed\nto the SRC's plan.\nMr Arthur told FELIX that he\nhadn't 'got a definitive answer yet'\nbut that Vickers had given several\nreasons why the proposal would not\nbe a good one. He said that they had\nasked for more information, which he\nhad sent, but he had not received a written reply.\nMr Arthur went on to say that if\nVickers did say no to the proposals\nthen the matter would have to be re-discussed at the next SRC. He said\nthat the only other hall suitable to\nbecome postgraduate only was one of\nthe Southside halls of residence. If\none of these was not accepted then the\nidea of a new postgraduate hall would\nhave to be scrapped.\nUnion President Sydney Harbour\nBridge said that he was 'in a tricky\nsituation' because a Union General\nMeeting had mandated him to resist\nany moves to make any part of\nSouthside postgraduate only. He said\nthat he would take any new proposals\nback to a UGM which could decide\nto call a rent strike if College forced\na postgraduate hall on Southside.\nMr Arthur said that 'everybody\nthought that it (the proposal for a postgraduate only hall) was a good\nidea but they didn't want it in their\nhall'. It will be up to the Residents\nCommittee to decide on a final\nproposal if Vickers should object to\nusing Weeks.\nNUS threatened by MPs\nAn attempt by Tory back bench MPs\nto force student unions to 'opt in' to\nthe National Union of Students,\ninstead of the present automatic\nmembership system, is unlikely to\nsucceed. Some 214 backbencher s tabled an 'early day' motion\nproposing the change, led by\nConservative Tim Janman, MP for\nThurrock.\nThe NUS, in fighting the motion,\nclaim that the NUS is not a closed\nshop; student unions can and do vote\nto join and leave, they say their\npolicies are decided by students at\ntheir conferences, all of whom are\nelected in cross-campus ballots.\nThe Government announced\nyesterday that they would not be\nadopting the clause and so it was only\ntabled near the bottom of the order\npaper, enabling any opponents to 'talk\nthe motion out'.

As part of such\na protest it was decided that at IC our\nconcerns for Galina Pilmenstein ought\nto be relayed to the Soviet Embassy\nin London. Galina (and her family)\nhave been refused exit visas from\nRussia due to military secrets that, it\nis claimed, her father knows, (from\nthe Russian army, fifteen years ago)\nand might have relayed to her. So at\nImperial, we decided that Galina's situation should be shared with the\nmasses.\nArmed with the symbol of all IC\nSoviet Jewry events, a plentiful\nsupply of After Eights chocolates, a stall was set up in the JCR, attracting\nmany a passer-by. The Student and\nAcademic Campaign for Soviet Jewry\nhad announced that, considering that\nmany hundreds were fasting up and\ndown the country in support of\nrefuse nik s, paper plates should be\nused as stationery on which to write\nto the Embassy. This went down very\nwell with the students approached,\nand about seventy letters were written\nwithin a short period of time. (Thank\ngoodness for After Eights!!)\nThe enthusiasm shown during this\npast event will certainly allow us to\neagerly await an optimistic reply from\nthe Embassy\u2014failing that, next term\nwill be seeing more eventful events.\nIf you feel you could help with the\ncampaign, please contact J Goldstein\n(Chem 1).\ncv soc\nNow that ICU has Beetlesoc, why not\nsocieties to promote other classic\ncars?

The incredible facial\ntechnique of Thomas and his\ncontinuous winking to the judges\nworked in their favour, as did the\nexpressive way in which they both\ndanced.\nAnother pleasing result was the\nfifth place which Thomas Puetz and\nRachel Condor got in the open samba\nafter only two lessons in that\nparticular dance. All that was missing\nfrom this performance was a timely\nslap around the face from Rachel,\nperhaps next time.\nThe end of the evening saw the\noffbeat entries performing to a new\nset of judges who obviously were\neither blind to dancing talent, or more\nlikely, preferred to see suspender-clad\ngirls rubbing themselves against\nchairs than a truly entertaining\ndance.\nAfter winning convincingly at the\nSouthern Ball three weeks earlier\nImperial were not even placed in the\nfirst three.

IC 'B' were less fortunate,\nlosing to QM C and UCL'A', but\nbeating Royal Holloway 'B'30. In\nthe semi-final, IC 'A' came up against\nUCL 'A', but had to set de for bronze,\nlosing 1-2, UCL'A' went on to beat\nQMC in the final.\nAlthough comparatively few teams\nwere entered, the highlight of the day\nwas the women's competition.

A short corner was half-saved and Justin Brooking flicked the\nball into the Charing Cross net. The\nsecond goal quickly followed. A short\ncorner won by Andy Hall was\nconverted by Skipworth with a powerful shot.

In 1940, he started\nscientific work with the Government,\nlargely involved with the effects of\nexplosions. With this experience he\nwent to America to work on the\nManhattan Project. He witnessed the\nAlamogordo test and distinguished\nhimself at the Bikini Atoll tests where\nhe analysed the blast by its effect on\ncarefully arranged sea-water filled\npetrol cans, while the more\nsophisticated American monitoring\nequipment was destroyed by the\nexplosion. Penney was an observer on\nthe Superfortress bomber that\ndelivered the Nagasaki bomb and this\nexperience made him determined to\nsafeguard British cities by developing\na British bomb as a deter ent.

He was also\ninvolved with tactical submarine\nwarfare, and RAF bomb sights. But\nBlackett was a scientist with a strong\nsocial conscience, as his controversial\npaper the 'Military and Political\nConsequences of Atomic Energy'\nrevealed. In this work he argued that\nthe Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs\nhad been dropped for political reasons\nand not, as President Truman had\nclaimed, 'to shorten the agony of\nwar'. At the time his views were held\nas being pro-communist though they\nare now accepted as platitudinous.\nIn 1953, he became Professor of\nPhysics at IC, pursuing research into\nrock magnetism.

    "content": "And now for something completely the same\nAfter six months of\nintense, and often\nsuicidal,\nnegotiations, the\nSocial and Liberal\nDemocratic Party\nhas been launched.\nWho will be the\nleader of the new\nparty? And how\nwill it differ from\nthe old Alliance\nparties? Andrew\nWaller, FELIX\nstaff reporter,\ninvestigates.\nTo outsiders it would seem strange\nthat two parties which had just fought\na General Election on a joint platform\nof policies and looked as if merger in\nthe long or short term was inevitable\ncould come to blows about the\nquestion of a formal link up. On the\nwhole the Liberal party has been\nenthusiastic about the merger, both\nassemblies voted by huge margins to\naccept the merger, and all seventeen\nMPs have joined the SLDP. Merger\nhas split the SDP. Three of their tiny\nband of five MPs (not enough for\ntheir leader to lay a wreath at the\ncenotaph on Remembrance Sunday)\nhave decided not to join the new\nparty. Dr Owen and company have\nset up their own headquarters and\nhave substantial financial backing.\nWhen Dr Owen suffered defeat in the\nSDP Ballot last year he resigned, and\nthus the unknown Robert MacLennan\nbecame leader. Initially 'Bob' had\nbeen against the merger; however the\nmood of the party changed most\nmarkedly at the Portsmouth\nconference last September when the\nmerger motion (proposed by the only\nother pro-merger, MP Charles\nKennedy) was passed. Since then the\nOwenites have largely concentrated\ntheir efforts on setting up their own\nparty. They have always had a constitutional blocking vote as a% majority was needed in the Governing\nCouncil for Social Democracy.\nHowever, the Owenites commented\nthat it would not do anyone any good\nto 'trap' people in the, SDP and so\nrefrained from voting at the Council\nfor Social Democracy. The Owenites\nclaim still to be the SDP. However,\ncan the party be the same party as the\nSDP of the last general election when\nthe majority of members and\ncouncillors have left? The question of\nthe logo is a very contentious issue.\nLegally there seems to be little to stop\nthe Owenites from continuing to use\nit.\nSo what of the future of the Social\nand Liberal Democrats? At the\nmoment the party leader less although\nthe timetable for the leadership\nelections in which all party members\nwill vote has been brought forward\nto this summer. David Steel is by far\nthe most popular choice. However, he\nhas indicated that he would like to see\na new leader. Paddy Ashdown (MP\nfor Yeovil) seems the next choice. A former member of the naval\nequivalent of the SAS, he has\ncharisma and charm. He did mix with\nThe anti-nuclear elements of the\nLiberal Party but clearly supported\nDavid Steel in the 1986 defence\ndebate at Eastbourne. Apart from\nPaddy Ashdown there are several\npossibles including Alan Beith (MP\nfor Berwick-upon-Tweed), former\nLiberal deputy leader Malcolm Bruce\n(MP for Gordon) and Alex Carlisle\n(Montgomery). Nothing rules out ex-SDP leader Rober MacLennan but he\nhas taken too long to become even\nvaguely known to the electorate.\nIt would seem reasonable to assume\nthat the new party may regain some\nof the electoral support it lost during\nthe bitter fighting. Since the General\nElection its standing in the national\nopinion polls has halved from 25%\n(June 1987) to around 12%. A MORI\npoll in the Sunday Times indicated\nthat support had risen to 14% (up 2%\non last January). A Harris Poll\npublished in the Observer on the same\nday put support for the break-away\nOwenites at 2%. At first sight 2%\nseems a pitiful amount for a party to\nhope to continue, however in 1951 the\nLiberal Party dipped to 2.5% yet still\nhad six MPs. However four of these\nseats had no Conservative opposing\ncandidate\u2014but there would be\nnothing to stop the Tories from\n'assisting' the election of at least Dr\nOwen as it could be to their\nadvantage.\nIn the months since the last set of\nDistrict Elections in May 1987 the\nAlliance has lost 23 seats. However,\nit has in one form or another gained\ntwenty seats and on the day the press\nlaunch was held, the new party\u2014the\nSLDP\u2014took a seat from the\nConservatives on Avon County\nCouncil. Indeed the true potential of\nthe SLDP will be tested in the next\nParliamentary by-election (or possibly\nnext May's District Elections).\nRelations between the SLDP and\nOwenite SDP will be sorely tested. Dr\nOwen is in danger of being seen as\na spoiler; by putting up candidates\nagainst SLDP candidates he could\nwipe out any recovery. The chances\nof an electoral pact seem minimal\ngiven the intransigence on both sides.\nAlready Dr Owen, in a BBC\ninterview, has accused the SLDP\nparty of having no policies. However,\npolicy leaflets for the new party have\nalready been published, and all new\nmembers of the SLDP will receive a membership pack including brief\npolicy statements which largely draw\nfrom the document used for the\ngeneral election with commitments to\nNATO, devolution, (surprise,\nsurprise) proportional representation,\nincreased spending on the NHS and\neducation, and increased industrial\ndemocracy. After the events\nsurrounding the merger the general\npublic will be less willing to sample\nsomething new than they were in\n1981 when the SDP was formed.\nDefence will be a potential stumbling\nblock, as the General Election\ncommitment to scrapping Trident will\nhave to be re-examined by 1991 (the\nlikely date of the next general\nelection). It will have been\nsubstantially paid for and will\nprobably be ready to be deployed, and\nthere may have been a shift in EastWest relations.\nThe organisation of the new party\nwill be based on parliamentary\nconstituencies, nationally making up\nten regions (excluding the Party in\nScotland and Wales which will be\nseparate). This resembles the former\nLiberal Party structure. However the\nfederal assembly which is the\ngoverning body of the party will be\nmore strictly regulated. Memories of\nthe Eastbourne defence vote die hard.\n16 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

Sexual\ntendencies in handwriting are a study\nin themselves; the precision with\nwhich all the varieties of sexual\ninclination and per vers i ties are\nsometimes mirrored in handwriting is\nreally astonishing.\nBroad handwriting originates from\nan unrestricted movement of the hand\nwhereas narrow writing is an\nobviously restricted sign.\nBroad:- lack of restriction, likes\ntravel, spends lavishly on himself,\nspeaks about himself and doesn't really care whether his audience is\ninterested or not, self-assured,\nin discrete, vain, very social.\nNarrow:- inhibited, economical,\nmean and distrustful, narrow-minded,\nshy.\nForm & Degree of Connection\nAngular connection:- prefers firmness\nto compromise, persistent, sulky,\ncruel, reliable.\nRounded connection:- amiable,\nopenly friendly, kind,\nArcade connection:-soft.\ndiplomatic,\ncalm, calculated, hypocrite.\nWavy connection:- intelligent.\n%\nDegenerating connections that\nmake the word look like a single\nthread and partially illegible is the\nmain sign of hysteria.\nThe degree of a person's handwriting is very difficult to\nchange. Connected handwriting\nshows that the writer is logical and\nnot easily distracted. If the connection\ncontinues through the whole sentence\nit shows an excessive desire for\nrelationships which are remote.\nDisconnected writing shows that the\nwriter has many different ideas.

Everyone I have ever\nmet doing Community Action work,\nboth within ICCAG and outside, has\nbeen friendly, though ful and aware oi\ntheir position. Ask them why they do\nit, and they'll think, and after a short\npause, tell you that they enjoy it.\nCommunity Action, and ICCAG,\nis fun. Of course, not everybody is\nattracted to the idea of Community\nWork, but those that do tend to be\nfriendly and incredibly easy to get on\nwith. I was feeling at home with them\nwithin minutes of joining my first\nsoup run. Part of it must be that there\nis always lots to do; there is nothing\nlike a common project to bring people\ntogether.\nIt is very difficult to write down just\nwhat makes Community Work what\nit is; you never know what it's like\nuntil you've tried it.\nWhat can I do to get involved?\nThe best way to get involved is to go\non a soup run. This is an experience\nin itself, and you meet the most\nunlikely of people sleeping rough.\nAgain it's something you will never\nknow about unless you go; you only\nneed to go once and, believe me, it's a real surprise. Be prepared,\nhowever, to discover as much about\nyour own attitudes as those of the\npeople you meet.\nWhat do I get out of it?\nSome of the community action\nschemes involve training; so you may\nacquire a new skill or two, but most\njust get involved for the sake of it. It's difficult to explain to someone who\nhas never been involved just what it\nis like, and what makes you keep\ncoming back to it. What you get out\ndepends, I suppose, on what you put\nin.\nDoes it take much time?\nICCAG is one of the few things you\ncan be involved in as little, or as\nmuch, as you like. You can just take\none evening out to go on the Soup\nRun, or commit yourself to work\nevery week for a year. The time you\nput in is up to you.\nAny more questions?\nGet in contact with any ICCAG\nmember, or come along to one of the\nmeetings...\nWho, Me?\nIC Community Action Group (ICCAG) offer\nthe chance to every student to become\ninvolved...\nIf you are interested, but haven't this amount of time free, there does\nexist a separate programme of 'one-off jobs. These jobs are available\nwhenever you have the time (although\nthey ask you to do at least one every\nthree weeks).\nAs well as getting out of the IC 'rat\nrace', you get a chance to experience\nthe real world and learn some\ninvaluable skills into the bargain.\nContact ICCAG for more details\n(while stocks last!).\nSoup Run\nThe College Soup Run, at its simplest\nlevel, exists to distribute soup, tea,\nsandwiches and biscuits to homeless\npeople in London. It is much more\nthan that though: it is an opportunity\nto see, understand and appreciate one\nof the largest social problems in\nLondon today\u2014homelessness\u2014and\nan opportunity to help alleviate some\nof the suffering and distress of those\nwho are homeless.\nNot everyone who sleeps rough is\nan alcoholic, dirty, rude old man.\nMany of the poeple we meet and talk\nto are well educated, once had good\njobs, homes and families but, for a variety of reasons, ended up on the\nstreets. The reasons are as numerous\nas the people: nervous breakdowns,\ndivorces, unemployment in their\noriginal homes and their drift to\nLondon to find work,' young people\nturning away from home...\nOnce on the streets, it is nearly\nimpossible to get off them. Council\nhousing is rare; it's difficult to get a job without a permanent address; it's difficult to get togther enough money\nto put a deposit on a private flat;\nlandlords are reluctant to rent to\npeople who look like they have been\nsleeping rough.\nThe College soup run is not a large\ncommitment. It certainly doesn't mean coming along every week. Just\ncome along once, to see a side of\nLondon that most people would rather\nignore, but which certainly isn't going\nto go away.\nRag Fete\nICCAG organises the hamburger/hot-dog stall on the Queen's Lawn and all\nproceeds go to Rag. Helpers are\nneeded beforehand to organise, help\nand generally be about.\nCrisis at Christmas\nEvery year an organisation called\nCrisis at Christmas hires out a large\nhall somewhere in London, and plays\nhost to up to 800 homeless men and\nwomen for the week around\nChristmas. They provide meals,\nsimple but comfortable sleeping\naccommodation at night, new\nclothing, hair cuts, medical attention\nand perhaps more cheer and comfort\nthan would otherwise be had by those\nhomeless people at that time of year.\nCrisis is a charity and depends on\nvolunteers to do everything, from\nsetting up the hall, doing the cooking,\nserving meals, clearing up during the\n'open' week and cleaning up\nafterwards. It certainly makes a difference to spend Christmas Day\nserving dinner to 800 instead of the\nusual family get-together s at home\u2014 .\nand the conversation tends to more\nvaried and interesting.\nThe 'open' is not the only activity\ncarried out by the charity Crisis.\nThroughout the year they hold\nfundraising events like sponsored\nwalks and they also support work in\nhostels for the homeless, and for\nrehabilitation. Open Christmasses do\nnot only happen just in London but\nalso in most of the other large cities\nin Britain, so you don't have to be in\nLondon over Christmas to be\ninvolved.\nJobsquad\nJobsquad is run by Kensington Town\nHall for the local community, which,\nbelieve it or not, does exist outside\nImperial, and ICCAG can put you in\ntouch with the relevant people.\nIf you're interested in teaching,\ncounselling, prison vi sting or similar,\nthere are about 20 schemes you can\ntake part in. Essential training is\nprovided free, so you aren't thrown\nin the deep end, but you need to be\nable to offer a regular commitment\n(often once a week) for at least a year.\nPlayscheme\nIf you're interested in working with\n5-10 year olds, both able bodied and\nhandicapped, there is a fort nigh ly play group in Acton.

After a short\ninterview at the Hospital, you can\nspend as much or as little time as you\nlike visiting patients without relatives\nof their own.\nTravelling Funds\nICCAG are sometimes able to assist\nwith funds towards travelling for\nstudents wishing to pursue\nCommunity Action work on their own\ninitiative over the summer vacation.\nRecently, they provided funds\nenabling someone to travel to\nNorthern Ireland to help look after\nhandicapped children and give them\nholidays out of the cities. Only limited\nfunds are available, however.\nContacts\nEither pop a note in the IC Union\nOffice, or contact: Liz Warren (Chem\nEng 2), Alistair Goodall (DoC 1),\nKate Cox (DoC 1), or Margaret Poole\n(Physics 2).\nAlternatively, just turn up for the\nSoup Run, which starts in Weeks Hall\nBasement at 9.15pm tomorrow and\nevery Thursday, including over the\nEaster break.\n18 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ers\nChallenging the\nintolerance\nDear FELIX,\nI am writing to correct some of the inaccuracies I read\nin a recent letter by Matthew Huntbach in last week's FELIX (no 798).\nI share Matthew's reservations about the UCCF\nstatement of belief and I would not join the Christian Union\nat my last university for this reason. The reason for my\nreservations was that the statement effectively barred my\nRoman Catholic Christian friends from membership. My\nchurch allowed any one who claimed to love the Lord to\ntake Communion and I saw no reason why the UCCF\nshould be so dogmatic. St Paul argued long and hard with\ncertain influential Jewish Christians, who insisted on\ncircumcision of Gentile believers, and I feel that similar\narguments apply here.\nHaving said this, I feel that Matthew displays a poor\nunderstanding and peculiar intolerance of evangelical\nChristianity, which must be challenged.\nAs an evangelical Christian myself I accept the Bible\nas the sole source of authority, but before I am condemned\nas a fundamentalist loony I must admit that in common\nwith many other Christians, I have problems with the\ninterpretation of biblical truth. There is plenty of scope\nfor abuse here and many people (Matthew mentions three)\nhave used the Bible to promote their own dubious and\nsometimes immoral views. It is in the search for a true\nunderstanding that the support and teaching of the Church\n(the whole Church) is necessary, although there is no\nsubstitute for sincere reflective study and prayer.\nMatthew accuses the CU( and I presume evangelicals\nin general) of selectivity in their approach to the Bible,\nbut he does not develop this argument. I must admit that\nI am surprised by his view of the CU as the British wing\nof the American 'televangelists' but again this argument\nis not developed.\nThe most inaccurate part of Matthew's letter is the bit\non 'justification by faith'. This is not the place for\ndiscussion of this very old argument, and most Christians\nhave to hold St Paul's teaching 'So the law was put in\ncharge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by\nfaith'\u2014Galations 3:24; and James's teaching 'You see that\na person is justified by what he does and not by faith\nalone'\u2014James 2:24 in tension. A better understanding can\nbe gained by reading the entire-chapters from which these\nverses are taken and also Ephesians 2:8-10.\nI doubt if anybody in the CU or even Matthew has inside\ninformation on Mother Theresa's destiny in the afterlife\nbut I think it is safe to assume that she will go to heaven\u2014\nnot because she is a 'good person' but because of her\nrelationship with God, and her salvation through the death\nof Christ.\nPerhaps the heart of the Gospel is that we don't have\nto be like Mother Theresa to be saved (which is good news\nfor most of us) but that we do need God's forgiveness\nand to be 'born again'.\nOn the matter of Christ's social teaching, this was not\nhumanitarian advice about how to be a 'good person', but\na command to love others as He loves us. It is not true\nthat the Protestant Church has rejected Christ's radical\nsocial teaching\u2014consider Lord Shaftesbury or Archbishop\nTutu, but please don't judge the CU on the performance\nof a few right-wing charlatans from the US.\nFinally Matthew, if you're reading this, if you really\nwant to stop the spread of sinister religions join me in\ncondemning the Moonies whose letter was printed after\nyours in last week's FELIX.\nYours sincerely,\nRichard Greenough (Robotics Centre).\nCareful\nhandling\nThe Editor of FELIX,\nUnder the terms of the constitution it is understandable\nthat the Union has decided to expel the Christian Union.\nThe membership clause is presumably unconstitutional.\nThe Union must now face the fact that some societies,\nby their very nature, require special status. It is necessary\nfor instance that the Orchestra restricts who plays in their\nconcerts. Societies which are affiliated to outside\norganisations (eg RAC) may be required to comply with\nthe regulations of that organisation. I would suggest that\nthe emotive nature of religions also requires careful\nhandling.\nSetting aside these considerations the letter, published\nlast week (FELIX 798) by Matthew Huntbach deserves\ncomment. It is not only bigot ted but also grossly\ninaccurate.\nI am not a member of the CU. I will not sign the doctrine\nof faith. I have never been made to feel unwelcome at\nany of the CU activities which I have attended.\nTo answer Mr Huntbach's first theological sortie, Christ\nsent his disciples to all men and left his spirit working\nin the whole world. Christianity is a product of his life.\nThe CU does not claim it to be a product of the Bible.\nFor Mr Hunthach to suggest that a society which has\na restriction on its membership claims to represent all\nChristians is patently rubbish. His later comment about\nthe Gnostic gospels is, frankly, foolish beyond permission.\nThe cases are entirely unconnected.\nEqually sensible is the suggestion that all members of\nthe CU must accept the Bible as 'The sole source of\nauthority'. Surely that is God! The CU belief is that the\nBible was written by people inspired by God and as such\nis the most authoritative text that we have. This belief can\nand does encompass an enormous range of opinions on\nthe infallibility of the content.\nMr Huntbach then goes on to attack Protestantism in\ngeneral. At this point the letter becomes incoherent,\ndisconnected and mostly drivel. His claim about the\nconnection between the CU and TV evangelists is rubbish.\nHis point about Mother Theresa is untrue and irrelevant.\nHe manifestly has no understanding of the concept of\n'justification by faith'.\nI would suggest that the major message of 'Christ's radical social teaching' is that to preserve slavishly the\nstatus quo is not sufficient, no matter how infallible one\nbelieves the tradition to be. Such things should be\nquestioned and followed only if the individual's conscience\nfinds them to be correct in all things. Some of Christ's strongest conflicts were with the traditions of established\nreligion.\nIn his last paragraph Mr Hunthach exhorts all Christians\nnot to tolerate the CU.I would suggest that such a blinkered attitude is far more sinister than anything the\nCU might produce.\nYours faithfully,\nSJ Lockerbie, Physics 2.\nSmall Ads\n\u2022 Shoobedoobee doo bee doo ahh (clap\nclap) (repeat if necessary).

The Parking Situation at Imperial College\nIt has come to my attention that the parking situation\nin IC grounds, at present very far from ideal, could be\nimproved by three simple methods:\n1. Removing all burnt-'out shells of cars in College\nwasting spaces, ie one white Hillman Imp to name but one.\n2. Limit parking permits to students who live outside\nthe Westminster and Kensington/Chelsea boroughs.\n3. Have a more democratic allocation procedure\nwhereby ordinary students ie non-Union hacks, have an\nequal chance to obtain a permit.\nIt is hoped that IC will meet the demand for parking\npermits because they cannot provide adequate\naccommodation services. Due to the lack of appropriate\naccommodation in Central London many people are forced\nto live further away, thus requiring transport to travel to\nand from College.\nThe present situation whereby several residents of\nSouthside/Tizard etc, have permits, is ridiculous.\nResidents' parking permits can easily be obtained from\nthe appropriate London borough and the few permits\nallocated to the Union could be distributed to those living\nfurther away.\nYours sincerely,\nNames withheld by request.\nCollege inferno\nDear Judith,\nIt is not only the Lyon-Playfair Library which is\noverheated and poorly ventilated (Letters, FELIX, March\n11). Coming from Exhibition Road into the Mechanical\nEngineering Building every morning is like walking into\na hothouse, regardless of the outside temperature. The lab\nin which I work, on the 4th floor of Mech Eng, is only\nbearable in shirtsleeves with the windows wide open.\nLast winter I suffered this in silence, but a couple of\nweeks ago decided to contact the Energy Management\nSection to ask if they could turn down the heating.\nAdmittedly they did send someone round to check the\nroom temperature, but whoever had briefed him had said\nthat I wanted the heating turned up! Having sorted out\nthis misunderstanding I was hopeful of some improvement,\nbut the heating still has not been noticeably turned down.\nApart from this profligate waste of energy, stuffy,\noverheated surroundings are more conducive to sleep than\nresearch work and are particularly uncomfortable for\nanyone suffering from one of the numerous cold viruses\nwhich stalk institutions during the winter months. As Julian\nHenson said, something must be done about it.\nYours sincerely,\nK Taylor, R/A, CFDU.\nJaws 1\n(the early bird and all that!), then continue right through\nthe weekend, without even coming up for air.\nDon't forget boys, small-fry get eaten alive.\n'May the Jaws be with you!'\nSharkSoc.\nJaws 2\nDear Judith,\nWe nearly had a collective heart attack (v serious) when\nwe read the letter from The Gauntlet Club last FELIX.\nWho are these amateurs?\nWe, at SharkSoc, began our prowl on Thursday night\nDear Gauntlet Club,\nWith regard to your challenge of Friday 11th March\n1988, we should be delighted to take part in a competition\nin accordance with the following rules:\n1. The contest to take place between 8pm and 8am on\na weekday night to be nominated during next term.\n2. Photographic evidence, including evidence of date,\neg, that day's newspaper, to be taken during attack phase.\n3. Points to be awarded per target with bonuses for\nmultiple tar getting, unusual objection, etc.\n4. Teams to consist of two hand-picked sharks.\n5. Fins optional.\n6. No substitutes or support teams to be allowed\u2014you're\non your own!\n7. Venue at discretion of individual teams.\nWe look forward to hearing from you next term.\nYours sincerely,\nThe Penthouse Club.\nAnother Vodka\nand tonic\nDear Judith Darling,\nA funny thing happened to me the other day. Half way\nthrough a bottle of Smirnoff it suddenly struck me that\nthe reason you had so many letters at the end of the term\nwas because it was the perfect opportunity to slag someone\noff without giving them a chance to reply. Obviously I wished to grab such a rare opportunity with both hands,\nbut unfortunately I couldn't think of anyone, so I threw\nup on my bed instead. Luckily, my duvet saw the funny\nside.\nYours,\nMiss Kate McHughie.\nSLAGging off\nDear Judith,\nI am so pleased and happy that James Papa is at Imperial\nCollege.\nI have for some time been contemplating coming out\nof the closet (where I am hiding with nearly four hundred\nof my close friends), and it is entirely due to him that I have decided:\n1. Not to come out.\n2. Not to attend any SLAGS meetings.\n3. Not to be gay.\nNice try James.\nYours sincerely,\nEx-gay IC student\nFELIX Wednesday 23rd March 1988 39\n\n"

The car was\nleft behind Linstead Hall, with the\nmascots still in the boot. The student\nthen called the Mascotry team which\nopened the boot and took the mascots.\nAt first Guilds denied that the\nmascots had been taken but later it\nbecame clear that RCSU had indeed\nremoved them.\nRCSU plan to ransom the mascots\nback to Guilds for Rag.\nThe City and Guilds Hustings UGM took place yesterday. The Presidential\ncandidates, Ralph Greenwell\u2014proposed by Duncan Royle, and Chris\nHome\u2014proposed by Chris Greenwood, each had three minutes to say\nwhy they thought they should be elected next year. With neither candidate\nreaching quota on the first allocation, the second placed votes were counted.\nThis proved to be the closest ever presidential election in the history of\nGuilds with 49first place votes and 62 second place votes cast for each\ncandidate. Under Guilds election rules, it was left for Returning Officer,\nAlan Hepper, to have the casting vote. He ruled that as Mr Greenwell\nwas a second year, the vote should be cast in his favour, and so he was\nelected and subsequently ratified as next year's President.\nIn the election for Vice-President, Max Kallios was returned unopposed\nafter Chris Home announced his decision not to stand down to VP\ncandidate.\nThe election for Hon Sec was close with Murray Williamson polling 61\nvotes to Chris Greenwood's51. Following the meeting, Mr Greenwell followed the tradition of buying\neveryone present a round in the Queen's Arms, which came to \u00a356.09.\nMr Greenwell told FELIX, 'I'm completely under w helm ed'.C& GU President elect Ralph\nGreenwell holds Spanner aloft\nLawson gets rid of covenants\nParents whose children enter higher\neducation for the first time this\nAutumn will be expected to pay up\nto 25% less towards the student's maintenance, following last week's Budget.

    "content": "THEAm\nWaiting for Godot\n(National Theatre)\nSamual Beckett's Waiting for Godot\nwas written in 1949 but not seen in\nBritain until six years later. In the\nsubsequent years many different\ninterpretations of the play have been\nsuggested: waiting for the second\ncoming of Christ; the futility of life;\noccupied France in the Second World\nWar, to name but a few, it is,\nhowever, without doubt an\nastounding piece of Absurdist drama.\nMichael Rudman's production at\nthe National builds wonderfully upon\nthe relationship of Vladimir and\nEstragon, the two tramps that just\nwait. We see Vladimir (Alex\nMcCowen) portrayed as a mildly\neccentric, wayward relation, who is\noptimistic, confident and certainly\nlovable. He twists and plays with the\nconversation to pass the time, often\noblivious as to whether his scared and\npitiful companion, Estragon, is\njoining in. John Alderton's Estragon\nis ad is abi lita tingly nervous crack-pot,\nwho's life has been narrowed down\nto here and to now. He has no\nknowledge of what he did yesterday\nor the day before, except that he was\nbeaten again, but at times he just\nfloats\u2014a peaceful and happy escape\nfrom reality.\nAs this relationship grows we see\nthe angst between these two unequal\ncharacters living in their shared\nenvironment. Estragon's glee at any\nand all manifestation of Vladimir's incontinence, his desperate need of\nsomething with which to fill his days\nand his double-sided faith in Vladimir\nto provide this. We find ourselves\nlaughing with these tramps, enjoying\nthe rhetoric, but the arrival of Pozzo\nand his servant, Lucky, over the\ndelightful rough hemp set, causes the\nstep to falter.\nPozzo (Terence Rigby) is loud,\nbrash (a little to so, in my opinion)\nand sure of himself (with more than\na passing resemblance to the\nNational's Sir Peter Hall), whereas\nLucky is a tired old servant, who\ndoesn't speak and moves in the\nminimalist ic fashion. The change\nwhen he enters into his speech, is\nsudden and sharp. Peter Wight's portrayal of Lucky's speech is\nunusually slow with pauses that could\nalmost be mistaken for thoughtful!\nUnfortunately the repetitive nature of\nthe in t eruptions by Vladimir and\nEstragon (all given too much time)\nproduces an absurd, rather than\n'absurd is t' piece of drama.\nMSILL\nMorrisey-'Vive Hate'\nMorrissey has joined with producer\nStephen Street, who also wrote the\nmusic, for his first non-Smiths album.\nStephen Street will inevitably be\ncompared to Johnny Marr, and\nun favourably by many. I think that the\nmusic has a quality very similar to\nthat expressed in the words of the\nsongs.\nMorrissey's view of England today\nreflects a country where people\nhopelessly yearn for qualities they can\nnever possess, and those who have\nsuccess are used then forgotten.\nMargaret on the Guillotine illustrates\nwho he considers responsible and\nwhat their fate should be.\nA wistful elegance pervades this\nwhole record being most evident in\nLate Night, Maudlin Street and Every\nDay is Like Sunday. This could be\nconsidered a catalogue of w hinge ing from the the master of despair himself\nbut I feel that would just be a blind\nJOOKL\nThe Enigma of Arrival\nby VS Naipal (Penguin \u00a33.95)\nVS Naipal is an Indian, born in\nTrinidad, who came to England\nduring the fifties. In The Enigma of\nArrival he compares to his\ndevelopment as a writer with the\nchanging aspects of England. Naipal\ncan take the most ordinary and\neveryday happenings and relate them\nto his journey from birthplace to\nadopted country. This book is\ndescribed as an important and\npowerful novel by one of the greatest\nnovelists of our time.\nThe Green Man\nThe difference between absurd\ndrama and absurd is t drama obviously\nmakes or breaks the production and\nMichael Rudman has been very\ncareful to keep on the right side of the\nline (most of the time). He succeeds\nmainly because of two such strong\nperformances by Messrs Alderton and\nMcCowen, both of whom excel in\ntheir roles and also because Waiting\nfor Godot is such a superb play.\nAidan Kershaw.\nby Kingsley Amis\nThe Green Man is a pub, and Maurice\nAllington is the publican. He is an\nalcoholic with a beautiful young wife\nand a stunning young mistress. He is\nalso haunted by the spirit of Dr\nThomas Underhill who died in the\nseventeenth century.\nI started reading The Green Man\nthinking I would definitely not enjoy\nit: I normally prefer realistic subjects\nand I do not believe in ghosts.\nHowever I was not prepared for\nKingsley Amis' uncanny knack for\nwriting. His control of the English\nlanguage makes the character of\nMaurice Allington a very true one,\none that the reader can believe in and\nfind very funny. This means there is\nno surprise when he casually comes\nacross a ghost or two wandering\naround the pub. It is also very\nfrightening. The fear arises as the\nother characters react to the alcoholic\nwho is convinced he has seen a ghost\nas normal: cut back on the whisky;\nbut we know it's not the drink, we\nknow it really is a ghost, just that no\none will believe it is.\nKingsley Amis keeps up an\nexcellent balance for fear and humour\nthroughout the book, making The\nGreen Man a very fine novel indeed.\nThomas RM Greig.\ncondemnation of a very articulate\nfigure.\nFor those interested an excellent\nfanzine, Smiths Indeed is available\nfrom Mark Taylor, 132 Sylvia\nAvenue, Knowle, Bristol, BS3 5BZ for 70p and as. a. e. The Fall\nthe FRENZ Experiment\nThe Fall are probably the only band\nwho could get away with releasing\nthis record with its dead Northern\nvocals and rambling guitar/keyboard\nbacking. However in a world of Rick\nAstleys and Tiffanys with their sterile,\nmushy, overproduced crap the Fall\nare monumental. Mark E Smith's humour runs riot with tracks like\nFrenz, Oswald Defence Lawyer, and\nGuest Informant. If you hate the fall\nthis record isn't for you; 'The\nmiserable Scottish hotel resembled a1970s Marillion or Genesis LP cover'\nis a line that will probably make your\nblood boil and cause you to rave about\ntheir lack of skill (instrumentally and\nvocally).\nBut if you count your friends on the\nfingers of one hand buy this record\nand increase your fr enz. ML\nThe Rhythm Sisters are two identical\nlooking sisters from Leeds. They sing\nin harmony over a single acoustic\nguitar which has the disadvantage that\nall their songs sound very similar.\nOverall the effect was just grating and\nmonotonous. An album Road to\nRoundbay Pier is available.\nNext on stage were the James\nTaylor Quartet, looking at these four\nmen you could be excused for\nwondering what the fuss was about.\nThey play instrumental tunes from\n60s film/TV series such as 'Mission\nImpossible' and 'Blowup', which\nconjures up a really frenetic\natmosphere. They headline at the\nTown & Country Club on March 26,\nand I can't think of a better reason to\npart with five pounds.\nVoice of the Beehive are just frills\nand whirling dresses, try to touch\nthem and you find nothing there.\nThey play a mix of 50s80 s Rock and\nRock of the same brand as the B52s and the Bangles.\nThis was a good performance for\nthe fans and I did quite enjoy it,\nexcept for the inane introductions they\nfeel we need to appreciate their songs.\nA final niggle, this gig finished at\n10.30pm which I found ludicrously\nearly.\nF.A.B.

    "content": "UNDER! n THE MICROSCOPE by Steve Black\nEditorial\nThose of you who promised features\nfor the science page had better get a move on: there are only eight issues\nof FELIX left this year. The Easter\nholiday is a good time to get stuck in\nto an article. You do want to be\nfamous don't you? You do want to get\nyour name in print? Honestly, it really\nis good for you and it really isn't that\nhard to do. Articles can be sent to me\nvia the Chemistry PG letter racks or\nyou can phone me on int 4642.\nStories illustrating Richard\nFeynman's unique approach to things\ncontinue to appear. Here is one I found particularly worth repeating\nsince it shows Feynman himself\nputting all his great achievements in\nphysics into perspective. The source\nof the story is Marcus Chown, who\nis Reviews Editor for New Scientist.\nThe first science prog a mme that\nMarcus Chown's mother ever\nwatched was the Horizon profile on\nFeynman. She seemed very interested\nin him, even though she had never\nshown any other interest in science\ndespite her son's constant attempts to\nexplain physics to her.\nLater, when Chown was at\nCalTech, he thought of the useful\nidea: he would ask Feynman to write\nto his mother in the hope that this\nwould prompt her to be more\nreceptive to his explanations of\nscience. He had never spoken to\nFeynman before, but he knew,\nsomehow, that he wouldn't reject the\nidea as trivial.\nHe was right, Feynman duly posted\na letter, but this is what it said: 'Dear\nMrs Chown, ignore your son's attempts to teach you physics. Physics\nisn't the most important thing. Love\nis. Best wishes, Richard Feynman.'\nMarcus Chown told the story to\nillustrate Feynman's character and he\ndidn't think it was particularly\nprofound. But I think that it is both\nprofound and moving: the first time\nI read it I cried.\nFollowing\nbrains as they\nwork\nIf William of Ockham was a saint he\nwould be the patron saint of scientists\n(unfortunately he was excommunicated for heresy). He was the\n14th century theologian who invented\nthe principle that the simplest\nexplanation must be the best one\n(though he wasn't expelled from the\nchurch for this but for his adherence\nto Fransiscan vow of absolute\npoverty\u2014the 14th century Vatican\nwasn't too keen on poverty).\nOckham laid the intellectual\nfoundations for modern science by his\nespousal of the principles of\nempiricism and reduction is m. Modern science has been ruthlessly\nreduction is t. To find out how\ncomplicated things work, we have\ntended to chop them up into smaller\nthings that are easier to understand.\nThis has been an immensely\nsuccessful technique in the physical\nsciences. The ten million or so known\nchemicals can be chopped into the 100\nor so elements which can, in turn, be\ndivided into protons, electrons and\nneutrons, and so on.\nThis technique has not proved so\nwonderfully useful in the life\nsciences. There, reduction is m often\ngets in the way of progress: it is\ndifficult to understand how an animal\nworks by chopping it into pieces, as\nanimals tend to stop working when\nthey are chopped up. We find it\ndifficult to understand how brains\nwork (even though we understand the\nbits well) because the whole is more\nthan the sum of its parts. Biologists\nare, eventually, moving away from\nreduction is t methods and are starting\nto look at things as a whole.\nThis brings me (belatedly) to the\nsubject of this story: a new technique\nfor studying how whole brains work\nthat doesn't involve chopping them\nup. The technique is called 'Positron\nEmission Tomography' (PET for\nshort), but it's not as painful to do as\nit is to pronounce. It has already\ncaused a stir among brain scientists\nby short circuiting some of their\nprevious theories.\nThe method involves injecting the\nsubject with radioactive water (the\nradioactivity only lasts for several\nminutes and the amounts involved are\nsafe\u2014less radiation is involved than\nin conventional medical X rays). The\nemission can be detected and a map\nof where the radioactive water has\ngone can be made from the\ninformation. The parts of the brain\nthat work hardest use more water, and\nthe radioactive oxygen accumulates\nthere. This enables scientists to tell\nwhat parts of the brain are used for\ncertain activities.\nThe recent work involves a study\nof how we convert reading into\nspeech. Previously it was thought that\nwe convert the visual image into its\nspoken equivalent, then look it up in\na dictionary to see what it means and\nonly then pass it to the speech centre\nto be vocalise d. PET shows that no\ndictionary stage is needed: we convert\nscribbling s directly into sounds.\nHowever, the area of the brain that\nis active in converting writing into\nsounds is different from the area\ninvolved in actually understanding\nwhat is written. Perhaps this should\nhave been obvious from the behaviour\nof politicians.\nThe group are now working on the\nstudy of more complicated tasks.\nTheir work may prove useful in\naiding brain surgery in cases of\ninjury. Significantly, their work\nrepresents a technique that allows\nstudy of the whole brain without\nhaving to dissect it. The sort of\nanswers that they are getting should\nbe far more useful than the\nreduction is t models of brain action\ncommon at present.\nDeadly ve gI always get annoyed when people\ncomplain about chemical additives in\nfood. Most of them are there for a good reason and have been\nthoroughly tested for safety. The\nsame cannot be said for some of the\nnaturally occurring chemicals present\nin perfectly ordinary foodstuffs.\nRecently a group of chemists have\nspotted some particularly nasty\ncompounds in the celery, parsnip and\ncarrot family.'\nThe effects of these chemicals was\nfirst seen during the First World War\nwhen a group of soldiers in France\nwere taken severely ill after loading\nsome supplies into the truck. Initially\nthe symptoms were mistaken for\nmustard-gas poisoning (the Germans\nhad just started to use gas as a weapon). But it turned out that the\nsymptoms were the result of handling\nvegetables suffering mild fungal\ninfections.\nRecently chemists have been\ninvestigating the chemicals that cause\nthe trouble. The particular group of\ncompounds involved (with names\nsuch as ps or alen, angelic in and\ncorian dr in) are produced by some\nplants in response to stress such as\nphysical damage or fungal infection.\nThe compounds act by interfering\nwith nucleic acids and hence DNA\nreplication. They are at their worst in\nthe presence of sunlight which excites\nthe molecules enabling them to cause\nsevere genetic damage and virtually\nprevent cell repair or replication in the\ninvader. Unfortunately the chemicals\nrub off onto anyone who handles the\nvegetables. The resulting symptoms\nare rather like some chemical\nweapons. There are few regulations\nrequiring cancer-testing on fresh\nvegetables, but there may soon be a case for it, as these natural nas ties outclass most of the ones developed\nby man in deliberate attempts to make\ndeadly compounds. If the vegetables\nare in good condition, there is not\nusually a problem, but concentrations\nof the nas ties shoot up when the\nvegetables have been damaged. I'm taking my rubber gloves home from\nthe lab to use in my kitchen.\n(Chemistry in Britain, 24, p203)8 Wednesday 23rd March 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\ni mmm s miis mii mm ims: The 1988 Grand Prix kicks off on\nEaster Sunday (April 3) with Round\nOne of the Formula One World\nChampionships, the Brazilian Grand\nPrix at Rio de Janeiro.\nNew drivers, new teams, new\nengines and new rules make this the\nmost potentially exciting year for a long time.\nThe most important rule changes\nare the second phase of the plans to\nreduce the power of the turbo-charged\nengines before they are banned totally\nin 1989. The turbos will be restricted\nto a boost pressure of 2.5 bar and a fuel allowance of 150 litres per race.\nWorld champion Nelson Piquet\nleaves Cannon-Williams for CamelLotus but retains Honda Turbo\npower. His team-mate will be the\nJapanese driver Satoru Nakajima,\nwho should again carry the miniature\nTV camera that gives such stunning\npictures, particularly when Naka\ndrives into the back of other cars!\nNigel Mansell, now fully recovered\nfrom his Japanese GP practice\nThis has been one of my saddest\nweeks in my time as FELIX racing\naccident, spearheads the atmospheric\nattack in his Cannon-Williams-Judd.\nThe Judd is a new V8 by John Judd's engine development concern in\nNorthampton, and will also be used\nby the March and Ligier teams.\nFerrari ended last season on a high\nwith back-to-back wins in Japan and\nAustralia. They retain the strong\ndriver pairing of Gerhard Berger and\nMichele Alboreto, and also V6 turbo\nengines. The new chassis will,\nhowever, be the first Ferrari designed\nby an Englishman John Barnard from\nhis R&D base in Guildford.\nThe strongest driver line up of all\nmust be at Marlboro McLaren where\ntwice world champion Alain Prost\n(who has won more Grand Prix (28)\nthan any other driver) is joined by\nBrazilian Ayrton Senna. Having\nanother superstar as a team-mate has\nnever bothered Prost and I confidently\nexpect him to consistently out race Senna.\nThe only other possible winners\nthat I can see are the Benettons,\nbeautifully painted in the bright\ncolours of the Italian knitwear\nmanufacturer's garments. In Thierry\nBoutsen they have one of the most\nexperienced but unlucky drivers\naround. The second half of last season\nshowed that given mechanical\nreliability Thierry should win races\nand this year I expect him to break\nhis duck. His team-mate is the\ntalented but underrated Italian\nAlessandro Nannini. After two years\nwith the small Minardi team Sandro\nhas rightly earned a seat with a top\nteam.\nThe Rio circuit is a flat, 3.1 mile\ncollection of medium speed corners\nwith a long back straight.\nTemperatures will be extremely high\nand most teams should be making\nmid-race pit stops for new tyres.\nPredictions\u2014Ferrari have been\nsetting the pace in pre-season testing\nso I 'll go for a Gerhard Berger hattrick with Thierry Boutsen the best\nplaced of the atmospheric s. Highlights will be on BBC TV's Grand Prix programme in the\nevening. Check press for exact time.\nThe Easter holiday sees the start of\nthe two major European\nchampionships.\nF3000 International is the training\nground for future Formula One\ndrivers, with single seater Grand\nPrix-like cars with three litre engines.\nHopes for a British champion are\nrealistic with Russell Spence in a works Rait, Mark Blundell in a works\nLola, Gary Evans and Andy Wallace\nin GEM Raits and Johnny Herbert in\nan EJR Reynard. The first round is\nat Jerez in Spain on April 17th and\nthe series will visit three British\ncircuits (Silverstone, Brands Hatch\nand Birmingham) during the summer.\nThe European Touring Car\nChampionship (ETC) starts at Monza,\nItaly this Sunday (27th) with round\ntwo at Donington Park (on the A453\nnear East Midlands Airport) on April\n17th. This is saloon car racing at its\nbest and is well worth a visit,\nparticularly if you've never watched\nmotor racing before. The cars look\nlike road cars, the crowds aren't claustrophobic like a Grand Prix and\nDonington is a beautiful circuit.\nExpect the pacesetters to be the works\nTexaco Ford Sierra Cosworths of the\nEggenberger team and the works\nBMW M3's of the Schnitzer and\nLinder teams. Also worth watching\nis the Bigazzi BMW M3 of former\nGrand Prix driver Jacques Laffite and\nPrime Minister's son Mark Thatcher.\nThe main rally of the holiday is the\nRothman's Circuit of Ireland, round\ntwo of the Shell Oil RAC Open\nChampionship. After the surprise win\nby Penti Airikkala on the Cartel\nInternational, the Ford Sierra\nCosworths should win this all tarmac\nevent. Favourite is Jimmy McRae\nwith Phil Collins an outside bet to\nscore his first international win in his\ndisgusting pink car.\nIf you see any motorsport on TV\nand think that you'd like to try it, then\ndon't go and be a loony on the roads\nbut come and see the City & Guilds\nCollege Motor Club (open to all IC\nstudents) about our programme of\nrallies, circuit trips, racing schools\nand skid pan visits.\ncorrespondent. I stuck all my money\non a pig\u2014a bloody three-legged pig.\nPlayschool lost the Gold Cup. He\ndidn't just lose it\u2014he was obliterated.\nHaving told everyone in the College,\nfrom the Rector right down to the\nvery lowest form of life (FELIX\nEditor) to back Playschool, I now\nrealise that I couldn't pick my nose,\nnever mind a winner.\nI attended the Cheltenham Festival\nlast Tuesday. There was a heavy Irish\ncontingent present noticeably in the\nGuinness tent. They gave a mighty\nroar when their selections romped\nhome.\nI witnessed a lot of money changing\nhands, particularly in the fifth race.\nCats Eyes was heavily backed at the\ncourse, I saw several hundreds being\nhanded over to track side bookies.\nThey must have breathed a heavy sigh\nof relief when it was narrowly beaten\nby a length or so.\nHaving advised everyone wrongly\nI am now going into hiding.\nPaul Shanley,\nBrazil.\nFELIX Wednesday 23rd March 1988 25\n\n"

    "content": "THE LAST\nEVER BARON\n-the runner up\nLargeamounts, the Phallix Editor, switched\noff her VCR and phoned the Caped\nAvenger, the new head of the Super\nHeroism Department, who was in\nconference with Matt Chunder, the Caped\nCrusader.\n'Caped, come quickly, I 've just received\na video tape from your arch-enemy, Mad\nDan. He's threatening to kill all the\ncharacters in the Baron.'\nOkay, Largeamounts, I 'll be right over.'\nMeanwhile at the Cheapskate Head\nCitizens' Council, Sidney Spanker, Miss\nGreviousbodilyharm, Claire McUseless,\nDave Braincell and Jumping Jehosophat\nwere trying to teach some of the new head\ncitizens\u2014Dai Rocking, Heavy Smell 4id Coral Lustsome\u2014how to appear to be very\ngood at a job they were very bad at. Next\non the agenda was a mysterious\nvideo-tape.\n'Do you think he means it?' quailed\nSidney, hoping he would be spanked to\n' death in his new dress.\n'No,' said Heavy, glaring menacingly at Braincell. 'It's probably just a flag\nstunt by the Lumpsofmetalworshipers' Tit Squad.'\n'Yes I do and no it isn't,' said Mad Dan as he axed through the door and\nsliced them into very small pieces.\nLargeamounts was very worried. All her staff were on sick leave suffering\nfrom exhaustion, the citizens were convinced she could produce Phallix on\nher own, the printing press had blown up, someone was threatening to axe\nher favourite column, and she'd sworn at and hit the photocopier in desperation.\nIt had printed it would only work under a new editor.\nJust as she thought\nthings couldn't possibly\nget any worse, Geordie\nDogleash and Mr\nSpindivecrashburn of the\nMayfair Club dropped by\nin their car to pester her.\nThis is it,' she thought,\n'the lowest'. The the\nlights went out and in\nburst Mad Dan.\n'I'm gonna axe you for\nnot revealing the true\nidentity of the Caped\nAvenger!' he screamed.\nFortunately he thought she was alone and was taken completely by surprise\nwhen Mr Spindivecrashburn started breakdancing, enabling Geordie Dogleash\nto empty a bucket of photocopier fluid over him.\n'Quick!' yelled Spindivecrashburn, 'You can escape to the Bahamas and be\nour page one girl!'\n'Wheyaye,' rejoiced Geordie Dogleash as they all jumped into the flame-red\nAston Martin Vantage Volante and accelerated from 0 to 60 in under four\nseconds into the sunset, never to be seen again, except on postcards from\nthe West Indies.\nIn the Quite Tasty Burger Bar, McNorthey was a worried man. He'd promised\nto open a kebab joint in the lounge above the McNorthside bar, but he was\nrunning out of meat for the Quite Tasty outlet, never mind a new 'catering'\nventure. How he wished he ran Normal's they didn't use meat at all! And\nthe Baron wanted some sample kebabs now!\nSuddenly, in burst Mad Dan and cut off his arms, legs and head.\n'That's it!' thought McNorthey. Til cut up random drunks from the bar!'\nUnfortunately, he was unable to utilise this brilliant new supply idea because\nhe was dead and being sliced up to provide the kebabs for the Baron and his\nentourage.\nJohn Secretary, Michael Arthur and Mad Dash were also worried men. They'd just seen the Baron's copy of the dreaded video. Only the Baron was happy.\n'We won't have to deal with those pes key head citizens wanting the money\nfrom the quarries,' he explained as they all tucked into their kebabs.\n'But he wants to kill us too,' protested John Secretary.\n'No he doesn't,' insisted the Baron.\n'Yes I have!' yelled Mad Dan, axing his way through a wall as they all dropped\ndead of hemlock poisoning.\n'Knew we should only have eaten the polystyrene boxes,' muttered Arthur\nMichael as he breathed his last.\nCaped Avenger was not\n, having a good day. First he'd. been interrupted at a vital\nstage in his negotiation for a TV series and block-buster\nmovie, then he'd been\nunable to stop Mad Dan\nit e rally axing the cast of the\nBaron. He stood in the\nBaron's throne room\nwondering where Mad Dan\nhad gone.\nSuddenly he saw vapour\nemerging from the basement\nof the Baron's Tower, and\nwatched in horror as the roof opened.\n'Oh no! Not the Victorian ICBM/MIRV target ted on the Crimea, the Bars,\nParis, Berlin and Moscow!'\nHe sprinted to the control centre on top of the Stargazing Department, but\nMad Dan was already gone. A screen displayed the message, 'LAUNCH\nIMMINENT'.\n'ABORT LAUNCH' he typed in desperation.\nIMPOSSIBLE, THE ABORTION DEADLINE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 28\nSECONDS TO 18 SECONDS SINCE INITIATION. LAUNCH TEN SECONDS.'\n'ABORT TARGET.'\n'PLEASE ENTER NEW TARGET OR ALL HEADS WILL RETURN TO LAUNCH\nSITE.'\n'Ah, well,' he thought, 'might as well kill three birds and a pet with one stone.'\n\u2022 'NEW TARGET: KENNY & MAGGIE'S PLACE, UPPING LANE, LONDON.'\n'Should see off that Gerbill!' he continued to think.\nAt that instant the tele screen sprang to life. It was a nuisance, they were\nall in public places and never showed anything interesting, but you couldn't turn them off. Then he realised what it was saying:\n'Mad Dan, the new Dictator of Cheapskate, will address his slaves in two\nminutes.' To STODGE at once!\nMad Dan grinned at the camera evilly. 'Bad day, slaves. First I must reveal\nthe true identity of that mega wimp, the Cloaked Marina. He is ugh!' he said\nas the Caped Avenger suffocated him by throwing a self-sealing cape across\nhis face.\nCaped took the stage. 'Citizens of Cheapskate, you may go about your legal\nbusiness. But beware random laundry-users! I will get you.'\nThere only remained to\ndiscover the identity of Mad\nDan. Removing his mask,\nCaped gasped. It was his\nflat-mate, Mike\nInsaneaxewielding maniac!\nIs this really the end of the\nBaron?\nWill McNorthey's ghost\nopen the kebab joint?\nWill it be safe to get drunk\nin the bar?\nPS. The Caped Avenger is\nbetter known as...(edited\ndue to lack of space).\nFELIX Wednesday 23rd March 1988 7\n\n"
