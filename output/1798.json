First\ncame the botched publicity stunt,\nwhere he was photographed filling\nup a normal-looking Kia at a petrol\nstation, only for it later to emerge that\nhe\u2019d paid an employee of said station\n30 quid to borrow the car to make\nhim look more down to earth,\nand that the car was electric\nanyway. In the same gaffe,\nhe was papped trying to\npay for his fuel by scanning\nhis credit card against\nthe barcode scanner,\nsuggesting, I don\u2019t\nknow,thathe\u2019dneverpaid\nfor anything by card before?\nThen there was the bombshell\nthat his extraordinarily wealthy wife,\nAkshata Murthy, despite having lived\nin the UK since 2013, was registered\nunder \u2018non-domicile\u2019 tax status,\nmeaning that she does not pay tax\nin the UK on foreign income. Her\nwealth is largely comprised of her\n0.91% stake in the company her father\nco-founded, Infosys, which puts her\nnet wealth at almost \u00a3700 million.\nWhilst this is legal, it certainly doesn\u2019t\nlook good for the immediate family\nof the man in charge of all our taxes,\nand the public outcry reflected this.\nThirdly, there was the quite\nshocking revelation that Sunak was\nserved a fixed penalty notice, along\nwith Boris, for breaching lockdown\nregulations by attending at least one\nof the many parties at Downing Street.\nWhilst I would say that these three\ninstances increase in severity from\nfirst to last, in terms of making the\nChancellor\u2019s position untenable,\nthere seems to be a lot more sinister\nabout the tax status incident\nthan immediately meets the eye.\nFirstly, it is not simply a matter of\nprincipal, as the lockdown breaches\nessentially are. Given the regular tens\nof thousands of cases a day, and all\nthe other illegal mixing that went on,\nthe chances of the Number 10 parties\nactually contributing noticeably to\nthe spread of covid are vanishingly\nsmall (not that this takes away from\nhow terrible the behaviour is, and nor\nshould it). Murthy\u2019s wealth, however,\nis a different matter. The Guardian and\nBBC have both estimated that Murthy\nhas avoided around \u00a320 million in\nUK tax since living here, through her\nnon-dom status, however this is small\nchange compared to the savings on\ninheritance tax. The Times estimates\nthat the benefactors of Murthy\u2019s will\nshall save just over \u00a3400 million in\ninheritance tax when she passes, due\nto some obscure clause of the 1956\nUK-India treaty, and the\nfact that India simply\ndoes not have inheritance\ntax. \u00a3400 million is an\nincomprehensibly large\namount of money. A tax\nreaping of that size would\nmake up around 4% of the\ntotal expected to be raised\nby the recent National Insurance\nhike in the next year. Or around 8%\nof the cost that maintaining the \u00a320\nuplift to Universal Credit would incur.\nAnd this is just from one woman.\nThe kicker here is that she will *still*\nnot pay this, as the aforementioned\ntreaty means she will be exempt from\ninheritance tax indefinitely, even when\nher non-dom status in rescinded.\nWhat\u2019s worse is that they lied about\nit. The initial response from Murthy\nand Sunak was that she didn\u2019t pay\ntax because she is an Indian national.\nThis, obviously, was debunked almost\nimmediately by experts who explained\nthat Murthy would have had to\nintentionally \u201ctick a box\u201d on a form\nwhen registering her tax status. It was\nlaterrevealedthatsheevenpays\u00a330,000\na year to retain her non-dom status.\nFurthermore, Sunak has launched\nan inquiry to find out who leaked\nthe details of his wife\u2019s tax status,\nspending public money to do so\nand suggesting he still thinks that\nthe public shouldn\u2019t know? He said\nthat his wife had not \u201cdone anything\nwrong\u201d, seemingly making the\nmistake of assuming that because\nsomething is legal it is morally right.\nOne thing Rishi can do now to save\nsome skin (and maybe some chance\nat a future bid for PM) is to work\nto abolish this ridiculous loophole.\nThere are 238,000 \u2018non-dom\u2019s in the\nUK, and given the \u00a330,000 price tag\nfor retaining the status after seven\nyears in the UK, it\u2019s worrying to\nthink how much tax is being lost.\nNon-doms\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

    "content": "In September 2021, researchers at\nMIT spin-off Commonwealth Fusion\nSystems (CFS) reached a major milestone in their ambitious plan to build\na fusion reactor capable of net energy\ngain by 2025. The demonstration of\nthe high-temperature semiconducting\nmagnets, with a field strength of 12 te-sla, is a key technology hurdle for the\nteam. These magnets are at the heart of\ntheir proposed design, which if success-ful, pave the way for the construction\nof the first fusion power plant by 2030.\nFusion reactors have long been\nidentified as a highly desirable\nenergy source. First, they have a small\nenvironmental impact, using small land\nfootprints and small quantities of fuel\nto operate, without emitting greenhouse\ngases. Additionally, they provide a\nconsistent controlled source of power,\nindependent of the weather or the hours\nlong startup time of fission reactors.\nThey are inherently safe, incapable\nof the runaway chain reactions and\ndisastrous accidents of fission reactors.\nFinally, while they do produce some\nradioactive waste, this radioactivity\nwill decay to safe levels on a timescale\nof decades, rather than millennia,\nmaking the waste far easier to dispose of.\nFusion reactors operate via the fusion\nof the hydrogen isotopes deuterium\nand tritium, which releases energy.\nDeuterium (D) nuclei possess one\nproton and one neutron, while tritium\nnuclei possess one proton and two\nneutrons. Deuterium is found naturally\nin low concentrations in Earth's\noceans, bound with hydrogen to form\nheavy water (D2\nO). It can be extracted\nthrough established industrial processes.\nHowever, the natural abundance of\ntritium is too low to allow for practical\nextraction methods, so most tritium\nis produced industrially through the\nirradiation of lithium-6 with energetic\nneutrons in nuclear reactors - a process\nreferred to as tritium breeding. While\ncurrently performed in fission reactors,\nnew fusion reactor designs like SPARC\n(which stands for Soonest/Smallest\nPrivate-Funded Affordable Robust\nCompact) aim to allow fusion reactors\nto take over tritium production.\nHowever, fusion energy generation\nfaces a host of complex problems.\nOne such problem is the physics of\ncontrolling the plasma, which is at a\ntemperature of 100 million \u00b0C. This\nhigh temperature is required in order to\nensure that the deuterium and tritium\nnuclei - which make up the reactor's\nfuel - have enough energy to fuse; it also\nmeans that they move at extremely high\nspeeds. A magnetic field can be used\nin order to contain these fast-moving\nplasma particles. However, the motion\nof the charged particles within the\nplasma, combined with their complex\nelectric and magnetic interactions, leads\nto the development of waves within the\nplasma. This can disrupt the shape of\nthe plasma, stopping fusion or causing\nthe plasma to hit the reactor walls.\nThe high magnetic field planned for\nSPARC is hoped to make this problem\neasier, by allowing for the plasma to\nbe confined within a much smaller\nvolume and suppressing the waves\nwhich arise as the plasma is compressed.\nThe stronger magnetic field is only\npossible due to the recent innovation\nin superconducting magnet technology.\nPrevious designs for tokamak type\nfusion reactors\u2013a common reactor\ndesign which uses magnetic fields to\ncontain and compress the plasma\u2013use\nlow-temperature superconducting\nmaterials, such as niobium-tin (Nb3\nSn).\nThese materials limit the strength of\nfield achievable, thus requiring that the\nfusion reactor be made larger in order\nto reach net energy production. A larger\nreactor inevitably leads to higher costs\nand long construction times, such as\nthoseexperiencedbytheITERreactorin\nFrance, under construction since 2007.\nSPARC instead uses rare-earth\nbarium copper oxide (REBCO), a high-temperature superconductor capable\nof achieving twice the maximum\nfield strength compared\nto niobium-tin. This is\ncommercially available\nin the form of a steel\nand copper backed super\nconducting \u201ctape\u201d, which\ncan be wound in order\nto form a magnet of the\ndesired shape. REBCO\nhas only become a viable\noption in recent years, as\nit has become possible to\nmanufacture the necessary\nquantities at a viable price.\nInnovation in the\nmagnet design will\nalso help SPARC and\nits successor ARC to\novercome the tricky\nproblem of containing\nthe neutron radiation\nfrom the fusion reaction.\nConventionally this is\ndone using a neutron blanket, which\nconsists of hundreds of panels made\nfrom neutron stopping materials. These\npanels require complex cooling systems\nto remove the heat released by the\nemittedneutronsandmustbeassembled\nwith absolutely no gaps, so as to prevent\nradiation escaping and damaging the\nouter components. These plasma facing\ncomponents degrade far more quickly\nthan the rest of the reactor, likely\nrequiring that they be replaced yearly\nin a commercial reactor. Conventional\nneutron blankets must be disassembled\npiece by piece, passing the pieces\nthrough the cramped space between\nthe electromagnets so as to achieve this.\nThe cost and complexity of this is so\nhigh that many critics see it as the killer\nflaw of fusion as potential power source.\nSPARC proposes to replace this\nlabour-intensive assembly with a single-component vacuum chamber, which\nwill be immersed in a tank of the molten\nsalt FLiBe\u2013containing fluorine, lithium\nand beryllium\u2013at a temperature of\nover 460 \u00b0C. The liquid FLiBe serves\ndouble duty, as both the neutron\nabsorber and cooling fluid, which can\nbe pumped through a heat exchanger\nto remove heat from the reaction vessel.\nThere is only one problem: how to\nreplace the tank and vacuum chamber\nwhen they are intertwined with the\nsuperconducting magnets like links on\na chain. CFS\u2019s novel solution is to split\nthe magnets into two sections, joined\ntogether by superconducting jumpers,\nwhich can be rapidly disassembled\nto allow the entire inner section to\nbe lifted in or out of the reactor.\nThe choice of FLiBe also carries\nanotheradvantage.AstheFLiBeabsorbs\nneutrons, some of the lithium atoms will\nbe converted to the hydrogen isotope\ntritium, the rarer of the nuclear fuels\nused in the reactor. This process would\nallow the reactor to produce more\ntritium than it consumes, reducing the\ncost of producing fuel for the reactor.\nIt is through this combination\nof technological innovations in the\nreactors\u2019 magnets, cooling and radiation\nshielding that Commonwealth Fusion\nSystems hopes to rapidly drive down\nthe cost of nuclear fusion, bringing it\ninto the realm of commercial viability.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nMarek Cottingham Science Editor\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nInnovative magnet technology to accelerate the timeline for fusion\nSPARC fusion reactor aims to demonstrate net fusion gain by 2025 through innovative magnet technology\nFigure 1: a) Fusion of deuterium and tritium to form helium-4\nand an energetic neutron. b) Absorption of a neutron by\nlithium-6 to form helium-4 and tritium.\nPhoto credit: Marek Cottingham\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 29TH APRIL 2022\n15\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\u2018As It Was\u2019 is a treat for the ears (and the eyes).\nWritten by Zanna Buckland Books Editor\nHarry Styles has released the first single for his latest album, Harry\u2019s House, and I can\u2019t get enough of it.\nSingle Reviews\nMUSIC\nAfter remembering I hadn\u2019t put a parking ticket\nin my car and running back to buy one, I made\nit to the YorkLife stage set up in the middle of Parliament Square in York, just in time for Bull\u2019s set\nto start. I first saw the band support Sports Team\nin 2019 and now I kick myself for not appreciating them enough. Hours of listens over the past year\nand missing them play down the road in London\nearlier this year built up a need to see them again.\nStanding outside at 7pm in York, it was getting\ncold as Bull took to the stage with \u2018Bedroom Floor\u2019,\nthe dreamy opener of their debut album Discover\nEffortless Living. Their vocals were noticeably plastered\nwith reverb, transforming the freezing square into a\nsoothing dreamscape. The expected instruments were\njoined by a surprise recorder (maybe a tin whistle,\ndon\u2019t quote me on this) solo from lead singer Tom\nBeer during the (as far as I\u2019m aware) unreleased song\n\u2018Imaginary Conversations In My Head\u2019 which definitely\nfelt imagined because how else would I witness a tin\nwhistlesolo?ItwasunexpectedbutnowIwanttowatch\nit again, and again. The eclectic mix of instrumentation\nwas constantly expanded with a definite recorder solo\nlater in the set, a mini keyboard for Beer to solo on, and\na plethora of guitar effects.\nIn roughly every other song, lead guitarist Dan\nLucas took a solo and delivered every time. For the\nmost part, these jangly, crunchy pieces epitomised the\nband\u2019s indie rock sound, drenched in intriguing effects.\nIn an unreleased song I didn\u2019t catch the name of, heaps\nof phasers created a swirling grunge effect for a more\nchordal solo. Later, about halfway through the set, a\nsmall 8-bit style solo orchestrated Beer\u2019s outfit change\n(taking his jumper off). I can\u2019t mention outfits without\nthree special mentions: bassist Kai West was dressed\nfor the Wild West in a blue cowboy shirt and hat; Beer\nsported a crocheted hat for half the gig until it flew off\nas he jumped around\nthe stage during a\nparticularly energetic\nbreakdown; Lucas\nrevealed a tastefully\ngarish knitted/\ncrocheted green\nand pink vest after\nanother quick jumper\nremoval. The clothing\ncomplimented what\nwas shaping up to be a\nmemorable set.\nNearing the end of their set, Bull treated the crowd,\nwhich was a mix of diehard fans, intrigued passers-by,\nandpeoplewaitingforTheHowl&TheHum,toanother\nnew song, \u2018Tired Of Being Treated Like A Twit\u2019. This is\nwhere Beer\u2019s keyboard took the spotlight, performing\nan 80s style part before falling off its stand at the end\nof the song. All this built up to my favourite song of the\nnight, the final track of the set, \u2018Perfect Teeth\u2019. With his\nkeyboard still on the ground, Beer was up and down\nas he sang and then played some riffs. His vocals must\nalso be given a mention \u2013 they were so versatile, going\nfrom soothing and airy to screaming and shouting,\nall within the space of this finale. The vocals were\naccompanied by shimmering guitars in the beginning,\ngrowing fuzzier as the song progressed. I would love to\ntake a look at Lucas\u2019 pedal board; I was entranced by\nthe different effects he managed to showcase in a set\nthat I wished lasted longer. Bookmarked by a drum\nsolo, the set ended with shouts for one more song from\nthe crowd that were sadly crushed by the tight schedule\nof the night.\nHailing from Yorkshire too, I have a bias for Bull but\ncannot emphasise enough how much you should try to\ncatch them on their upcoming run of gigs supporting\nfellow indie rockers, FEET, this spring. You\u2019ll love it.\nNo darling, it\u2019s not a china shop! What do you actually think it\nis, give it another go.\nWritten by Joe Riordan Music Editor\nIt\u2019s YorkLife festival and Bull are performing!\nGig Reviews\n\u2018As It Was\u2019 is euphoric and catchy, with every necessary element of a hit single squeezed into a measly two minutes and 47 seconds. It\u2019s like a pop song on\ncrack, and I love every second of it. The electronic motif that opens the song is infectious, and the infection\nonly spreads as you continue listening. Harry\u2019s clear\nandmellowtonesareeasyontheearsandallowforfans\nto pick up the lyrics quickly, such that performances of\nthesongonlytwoorthreeweeksafteritsreleasealready\nhave entire festival crowds\nsinging along.\nThe music\nclearly draws\nfrom the\nnostalgia of 80 s\nsynth numbers,\na trend for\nmany artists at\nthe moment,\nincluding Dua\nLipaandYears&Years.Whilefollowingthecrowdisn\u2019t\nnecessarily a good thing \u2013 I myself have haughtily and\nhypocritically shunned the \u2018No. 1\u2019 on many occasions\n\u2013 in this case it is perfection. Call it what you want, but\nthere is no denying that Harry has tapped into some\nsongwriting gold.\nTheaccompanyingmusicvideoisequallyasglorious,\nwith a red-bedazzled Harry dancing around like a\nperfectly in-tune maniac. His co-star Mathilde Lin is\nan accomplished dancer and model, who complements\nhim perfectly and wears a matching sequinned\njumpsuit but in royal blue. The stunning sets include a\ncolourfully graffitied room and a swimming pool with\na white minimalist structure bridging it.\nYou don\u2019t need me to tell you that the track is\nbrilliant: it broke the record for most Spotify streams\nin one day, with 8.3 million \u2013 0.3 million more than\nOlivia Rodrigo\u2019s \u2018driver\u2019s license\u2019, the previous title\nholder. One of Harry\u2019s tricks was to tease the song\u2019s\nrelease with just its motif on social media, leaving his\nfollowers curious and wanting more.\nClips of recent performances at Coachella show just\nhow talented a rockstar he is, demonstrating flawless\nrenditions of his numerously popular songs, as well\nas showcasing covers of \u2018I Will Survive\u2019 and \u2018Man! I\nFeel Like a Woman\u2019 featuring the glamorous Lizzo and\nShania Twain, respectively. Having been to a concert\non his first tour, I can safely say he has blossomed as\na fully-fledged solo star, and his talent and confidence\nhaveonlygrownsincethereleaseofhisself-titleddebut\nalbum.\nNo shade to One Direction, but the Harry Styles\nof today is a far cry from the one of six years ago, and\nan incredible one at that. His third album (due to be\nreleased on May 20th) is sure to bring more of the\nsame, and better.\n\n"

    "content": "Iwill be honest, I first came across Wet Leg via a 30\nsecond snippet of their debut single \u2018Chaise Longue\u2019\non TikTok (that\u2019s right, I\u2019m on indie TikTok) and\nfound it repetitive and unremarkable to say the least. Fast forward\nto now and I have the album on\nrepeat. Hey, at least you know\nI\u2019m being completely impartial.\nThroughout the album, the\ntwo-piece\u2019s characteristic driving\nbasslines, punchy guitars, and\nwhimsical lyricism make for a\ndanceable sound that has me\nwishing I was frolicking in a field\nwith them. The combination of\nHester Chambers and Rhian\nTeasdale seems like a match made\nin heaven. The way the two have\nwoven together the rich tapestry of guitar and vocals is\natestamenttohowtheyhavehonedtheirmusicianship,\nboth individually and collaboratively. The two have\njoined forces to birth a record of delicious millennial\nangst set to loud guitars and it\u2019s a good one. They are\njoined by a competent rhythm section which adds\nthe accompaniment needed to really make the tracks\nshine.\nDespite the earlier singles\nfrom this album demonstrating\na more tongue-in-cheek,\nsuggestive side to Wet Leg\u2019s\nlyricism, such as the repeated\nutterances of \u201ctouching\nyourself\u201d in \u2018Wet Dream\u2019 and\n\u201cI got the big D\u201d in \u2018Chaise\nLongue\u2019, the duo manage to\nmake room for more serious\nmatters of the heart in tracks\nlike \u2018Piece of Shit\u2019. Of course,\nthey put their own delightfully\nscornful spin on it - talking\nabout an ex-lover, they say\n\u201cyou\u2019re a good guy, alright, whatever helps you sleep\nat night\u201d. I just lap up the tastefully distasteful, biting\nremarks they sprinkle into the album; I\u2019m a sucker for\ntheir writing.\nThe pair have struck a fine balance between upbeat\nand more intriguing, mellower songs. \u2018Loving You\u2019, the\nstand-out track for me, sees the crunchy, guitar-driven\nsound take the passenger seat as synths, electronic\ndrums, and even an accordion play a more central role.\nIt\u2019s a welcome side of Wet Leg to hear, showcasing a\nmore delicate style with a rich texture that\u2019s dripping\nin sweetness. Teasdale\u2019s vocals\nhere sound otherworldly,\nmaintaining a delicate, almost\nfragile quality. This, coupled\nwith the quieter production,\nmade me think the song was a\ntender ode to a lover upon my\nfirst listen and so I sent it to my\nboyfriend because it reminded\nme of him (a quick google of\nthe lyrics made me realise my\nfatal error). With scathing lines\nsuch as \u201cyou\u2019re just rubbing\none out up in the shower\u201d and\n\u201chope you\u2019re choking on your\ngirlfriend\u201d, definitely do not send this to a significant\nother.\nI can\u2019t help but talk more about Teasdale\u2019s\nmultifacetedvocals;attimesIfoundmyselfwondering\nwhether the track contained a feature. Her ability to\ndip into and out of different accents, the changes in\ntone, and her range left me stunned throughout every\nsong, a true vocal chameleon. Credit must also be\ngiven to Chambers who seems\nto know the exact tones and\nsounds to squeeze out of her\nguitar to complete every track\nperfectly.\nWhat I like most about Wet\nLeg is that they don\u2019t really\ntake themselves too seriously.\nThey\u2019re not trying to preach or\nbe irritatingly profound in their\nwork. Instead, they\u2019ve captured\nthe spirit of the twenty-something woman, revealing her\nrelatable experiences through\nheadbang-able tracks and\ntackling difficult growing-up feelings to a soundtrack\nof catchy melodies. All in all, this is a strong debut and\nI\u2019m excited to see where Wet Leg will go from here.\n14 Music.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nView online here!\nI\u2019ll admit I\nhaven\u2019t had\nan in-depth\nlisten to\nFontaines\nDC but I\nlove the\nhits, think\n\u2018Liberty\nBelle\u2019 and\n\u2018Boys In\nThe Better\nLand\u2019.\nThe Irish band\u2019s new album Skinty Fia is\nan incredible listen, and would have got a\nfull review if exams weren\u2019t coming up, but\nthey are so you\u2019ll just have to deal with a side\ncolumn for now.

    "content": "The Fever Syndrome: written by Alexis Zegermen\nand directed by Roxanna Silbert is currently\nshowing on the main stage at the Hampstead Theatre,\nand the offering: observing a dysfunctional American family, with a LOT going on! The play follows\nthe Myers family, not your run-of-the-mill American\nfamily, as they discuss money, science, and air their\ntroubles over the course of a little under a day!\nThe characters of this family are rooted deep in\nstereotypes of the science and cultural milieu that personifies the East Coast. Prof Richard Myers (Robert\nLindsay), the proudly Met-loving New York scientist\nwho pioneered IVF research, who along with his third\nwife Megan (Alexandra Gilbreath) hosts their three\nchildren on the eve of Myer\u2019s acceptance speech for his\nrecent Lasker award (the \u2018American Nobel\u2019 for medi-cine).\nDorothea (Lisa Dillon), the eldest sibling is a scientist herself (and on the board of Science) with a teenage\ndaughter (Nancy Allsop) suffering from a rare genetic\ndisease (The eponymous Fever Syndrome). The twins,\nThomas (Alex Waldmann) and Anthony (Sam Marks)\nare a pair of eccentric unsure\nmen, who just like Dorothea\ncling to their towering father\nfor recognition and affirmation every step of the way.\nHome for a dinner and\njust under a day, we watch\nthis family implode over trivialities as the bottled-up an-gerrisestotheforay,unleash-ing unresolved childhood\ntrauma. There are some very\nwell thought out themes of\nsuch dysfunction within the\nplay, but there is one too many squeezed in\u2014even for a\nplay over 2 hours long\u2014for them to be anything more\nthan side notes and catch phrases.\nThe story struggles to find space for any of the\nthemes inherited. We buoy from having discussed\ncryptocurrency and investment options one minute,\nto a failed marriage proposal, and, just minutes later,\nare forced to accept a poignant reconciliation! And it is\nnot just the siblings who have issues, but Richard Myers himself, who under the throws of Parkinson\u2019s has\nfleeting visions of his teenage daughter tormenting him\nfor, presumably, failing to be a better father. Individually these elements work and seem plausible but the lack\nof baggage in the emotional weight of the characters\nbetween one scene and another makes the whole play\nseem disjointed and improbable!\nIn the acting department, Robert Lindsay provides\na standout performance as\nthe patriarch of the Myers\u2019\nfamily. A pioneer of the IVF\ntechnology, who amongst\nother things, in his spare\ntime enjoys GOP bashing,\nmixing up tunes to inappropriate inside jokes about his\nson-in-law, and shuttling between being an absent father\nto a perfect one who knows\nexactly what to say at the\nright moments.\nHaving science feature\nprominently in a play is always a tricky endeavour! To\npull it off successfully with engagement needs a lot of\nexposition \u2014 while the play has enough of it, it unfor-tunatelyseemstohavebeenlargelylandeddownonthe\nshoulders of Nathaniel Cooper, Dorothea\u2019s husband\n(played by Bo Poraj) giving his character little to do\notherwise!\nThe set design, one of the most elaborate in recent\ntimes at the Hampstead Theatre, is intricate, detailed,\nand grand! Featuring a profile view of three stories of a\nNew York apartment, it allows us to observe the drama\nunfolding within the family, one room and one sibling\nat a time. In the foreground is a dinner table, a couch,\nand a pianoforte for Myers to dish out Chopin, overall,\nmore real estate than the average zone 1 London apart-ment. The lighting in particular is stellar considering\nhow most of these rooms are boarded up on three sides\nand the audience gets an extremely limited vista into\nthese quarters.\nWith an otherwise generic plot of a dysfunctional\nfamily - the play is moderately tame and beaten! But\nfor \u00a310 it is hard to walk away disappointed, especially given the stellar performances and the amazing set\ndesign \u2014 if anything it gives enough food for thought\nfor us STEM students on the difficulties integrating\nscience into a popular medium!\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n10\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCredits: Photo/Ellie Kurttz\nA modern scientific American family\nA drawn-out American get together\nTheatre\nThe Fever Syndrome\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "FRIDAY 29TH APRIL 2022\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 9\nARTS\nMike Bartlett\u2019s The 47th\nimagines Trump running\nagain for office in 2024. Biden is senile and\nKamala Harris harbours presidential ambitions. The\nplot meanders around Shakespearean corners. There\nare Machiavellian plots, surreptitiousness, and schem-ing. The result is a play that is more entertaining than\nthought provoking.\nThe play always feels in the shadow of Charles III,\nMike Bartlett\u2019s critically acclaimed Shakespearean \u201cfuture history\u201d play imagining the Prince Regent taking\nthe throne. Stylistically speaking it is The 47th\n\u2019s prede-cessor; both are written in blank verse and both are\nin heavy conversation with Shakespeare, borrowing\nthemes, symbols, and tropes. But casting Charles as a\nShakespearean tragic hero worked in that it gave him\na reasonably vanilla character in the grand scheme of\ngeopolitics, some intrigue and sexiness, allowing audiences to genuinely question whether he could be a\nsympathetic hero or a hubristic villain.\nBut none of the subtlety, nuance or balance of\nperspectives is present in The 47th\n, a play that revives\nthe chronic liberal Trump-bashing virtuousness that\nseemed to have subsided once the ersatz despot was\nvoted out. Trump is a villain yes. Trump is snarky yes.\nTrump looks a bit freakish yes. But we know this al-ready. The 47th\ndoes little to add to the political conversation by catering to our impression of him rather than\nwanting to challenge it. Shakespeare\u2019s best villains have\nmomentsofheartfeltcompassionthatletstheaudience\nreassess their moral stance towards them. Shylock\u2019s\n\u2018If you prick us, do we not bleed?\u2019 speech or Claudius\u2019 lament: \u2018O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven\u2019.\nTrump has no moment of self-awareness. Why? Because Trump is Trump. Because we, a Merlot sipping\nliberal audience have to, and always will, hate him.\nPortraying Trump as a laughing stock made for a\ncheap laugh back in 2016. But the shtick dissipated\nquickly because Trump really was a buffoon; there\nwas no SNL sketch or Spitting Image hot take to add\na satirical spin on the President. The 47th\nrehashes the\nsame tired platitudes that were thankfully put to rest\nafter Biden took office. But Bartlett\u2019s writing is highly polished. He does a masterful job in interweaving\nthe Trumpian jargon and idiosyncratic speech with\nShakespearean poetry and imagery. It is a shame that\nhis script does not lead us anywhere we have not been\nbefore.\nWhilst this does not make for a politically intriguing\nproduction, Bertie Carvel\u2019s hypnotic performance as\nTrump ensures that it is an entertaining one. From his\npenguin-like gait to the self-satisfied smirk, his uncannily accurate appearance induced gasps from the audience on his first appearance: driving onto the stage in\na golf cart. Tamara Tunie\u2019s Kamala Harris is equally accurate and fun to watch. An icy Lydia Wilson portrays\nIvanka Trump as a Lady Macbeth-like schemer. Her\nemotionless performance is chillingly enjoyable and\nher relationship with her father is enthralling as it is\ncreepy. The QAnon Shaman even makes an appearance\nas a surreal apparition, whirling up a crowd into a tightly choreographed frenzied mob in-between scenes.\nAs a play imaging his return, The 47th\ndoes little to\ninvestigate the life behind Trump, instead choosing to\ncater to a liberal audience who want to see nothing other than his unceremonious downfall. It is a play about\npolitics. But it is by no means a political play.\nThis is a play about politics, not a political play.\nTheatre\nReviewed by Alexander Cohen Arts Editor\nThe 47th\nWhere?

    "content": "As the audience enter the London Coliseum, the\nhandmaids\u2019 red jackets, symbols of their oppres-sion, dangle on stage inhabited as if being worn by\ninvisible figures. It is both a fitting and haunting image\nthat aptly summarises the concrete vision of artistic\ndirector of the ENO Annilese Miskimmon\u2019s directorial debut: to shine a light on unheard voices.\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale traces the inner life of a women living under the dystopian theocracy of Gilead\nwhere fertile women are forced to be handmaids who\nare ceremonially raped in a quasi-biblical ceremony.\nWith the Amazon TV series adaptation of the original novel, and Atwood\u2019s sequel releasing in 2019, The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale has as ingrained itself within popular\nculture. The now iconic red cloaks are even frequently\ndonned at women\u2019s rights protests across the globe. But\nwhatcananewproductionoftheoperaadaptationadd\nto the conversation?\nUnlike the TV series, where\nevery nook and cranny of Gilead is brought eerily to life, here\nthe world of The Handmaid\u2019s\nTale is left to the audience\u2019s imagination with a simplistic set; a\ngreen clinical coloured curtain\nborders the stage with a pink\ncurtain descending to mark the\nhouse where Offred is assigned\nto be used as a handmaid. Instead, the production focuses\non Offred\u2019s inner turmoil which\nfully inhabits the space.\nPoul Ruder\u2019s raw minimalist score maps each of Offred\u2019s emotional triumphs\nand obstacles. Conductor Joana Carneiro draws the\ngrounded and muddy elements out of the music; trumpets spatter, spit, and growl at Offred as if they are the\noppressive regime oppressing her. There is no hope of\nrelief from the sweet hum of a string instrument other\nthan the hymn Amazing Grace that is here demonically\ninverted, playing over each ritualistic rape scene.\nKate Lindsey\u2019s (Offred) voice is stern but agile. Her\nintense longing for freedom forges a clear sense of hope\nand she deftly navigates Paul Bentley\u2019s winding libret-to.Tryingtocramsomuchnarrativebackgroundintoa\njust over two-hour opera means that some of the story\nis rushed. Those who are not familiar with the novel\nmight become lost in the dense world. But creative\ndirectorial decisions make the\nstory easily digestible; memories\nof Offred\u2019s real family from the\n\u201ctime before\u201d Gilead are particularly haunting, projected onto\nstage with a grainy black and\nwhite film.\nAvery Amereau is a fiery Serena Joy, the wife of Offred\u2019s\ncommander who rapes Offred\nceremoniously. For such a cruel character, Amereau weaves a\nreal amount of sympathy into\nher portrayal, Serena\u2019s jealously\nsparked from deep-seated insecurity that Amereau slowly unravels.\nThe opera is probably not a must see for fans of Atwood\u2019s dystopia. But in the context of the opera world,\nit is essential. Given that many canonical works in the\nrepertoirearemiredbyalegacyofmisogyny,TheHandmaid\u2019s Tale stands out as a bold, unabashedly feminist\nopera that puts a woman centre stage to explore female\nissues rarely explored in opera.\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2014 Invisible Figures\nMy blue shirt left\nin an arid sun\nOpera\nPoetry Corner\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nEdited by:\nAlexander Cohen\nAlex jackson\nArts Truly dysfunctional...\nJust two stars for the Hampstead\nTheatre\u2019s The Fever Syndrome.\nBy Vaidhiswaran Ramesh\n11\npage\nCredits: Photo/ Jennifer Reynolds\n\u201cWherever they burn books, in the end will also burn human beings.\u201d\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\nReviewed by Alexander Cohen Arts Editor\nWhere?

But memory fades like\ncolour from a shirt left in the arid sun too many hours\nenjoyed under its earnest attention.\nAll that is left is scorched, I remember cloudless\ndays clad against pressed velvet blue, now a scorched\ngrey. melancholy is colourless, you remain in my cupboard floating in the dark, I cannot throw you away.\nBy Alexander Cohen Arts Editor\nCredits: Photo/Keanen Geego Kilian\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n\n"
