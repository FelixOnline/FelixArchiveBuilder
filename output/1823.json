They no longer have anything\npre-written,theytalknaturallyandcom-fortably into their shared microphone.\nThey have also made their project in the\nmost cost-efficient way. The softwares to\npost (Anchor for Spotify and Spotbin\nfor others), the editing tool for their recordings (Audacity), and their website\nare either free or low-cost. The microphone is checked before each recording\nto ensure maximal professionalism.\nYou may ask yourself, especially as a\nsecond or third-year student: Why do\nI need this? I already survived my first\nyear. Well, as the podcasts grow and\nAnouk and Laura are experiencing life,\nthey plan to share their journey beyond\nlife as undergraduates and postgradu-ates. Laura just confirmed a 12-month\ninternship which she plans on starting\nafter she graduates and her insights\nwill be very useful for all of us who plan\nto enter the industry or start working after our degrees.\nTheir goal is to reach as many international students and they started by contacting their old high schools in order to\npromote their podcast with pre-univer-sity students. They also reached out to\nthe news stations back in\ntheir hometowns. Luckily, their bachelors degrees\nwere instructive in teaching them the marketing,\npresentation and public\nrelations skills required to\nshare their product, and I\nmust congratulate them\nfor a job well done. The\nwebsite looks profession-al, as well as its logo. If you\nlook closely, you may find\na hidden speech bubble in\ntheir logo. Can you find it?\nThe answer will be at the\nend of this article.\nSince every international student is\ndifferent and has a different story, the\ntwo students are careful to avoid gener-alisation, however, they stay away from\nfocusing on specific cases, such that\neveryone can feel\nincluded. They invite\nmultiple guest speak-ers, such as Maya, who\ndiscusses the benefits\nand downsides of living\nalone or with flatmates.\nThey offered me a little\nsneak peek into their\nfuture by mentioning\nthat their next speaker\nwill talk about applying\nfor a UK Visa and what\nit is like to be a non-Home student.\nFurther plans include summarising the\nkey activities and restaurants of various UK\ncities, such as Leeds\nor London. This is to\nhelp international students compare cities\nin a quick manner. The\nteam is constantly innovating and looking\nfor ways to approach\nmore and more stu-dents. And of course,\nthey are open to listeners every day.\nLet's say, you wanted\nto rent an apartment\nwith your friend, but\nhave no clue. You can\na) try to figure it out\nyourself and make tons\nof rookie mistakes or b)\nprivately DM Anouk\nand Laura on Instagram and ask if they\nhave any advice. Be\nsure that if they do not\nknow themselves, they\nwill find a guest speaker\nwith good advice. Now,\nnot only will you learn\nabout London\u00b4s spectacularly friendly\nand honest housing market, with agents\nthat will never rip you off or landlords\nthat will give you the best price, but you\nwill have added to all the other listeners'\ngeneral knowledge. Who knows, you\nmay prevent your classmate or peer from\nbeing scammed as many of us have been\nby housing agents.\nAll salty comments aside, Anouk\nand Laura are welcoming new topics\nand guest speakers to come and record\nan episode with them.

    "content": "The fashion industry is undergoing a major technological revolution, and blockchain technology is\nplaying a pivotal role in this change. From establishing innovative payment methods to monitoring supply\nchain processes, the fashion world is embracing the\nnumerous advantages that blockchain brings to the\ntable.\nOne of the most substantial advantages\nof blockchain in the fashion sector is\ntransparency. As a decentralized ledger that\nrecords transactions securely and openly,\nblockchain makes it possible for consumers to\ntrace the roots of the\nproducts they\nbuy. This\npresents\nf a s h i o n\nb r a n d s\nwith the\nopportunity\nto display their\ncommitment to\nethical sourcing,\nwhich has become\ni n c r e a s i n g l y\nimportant to\nbuyers. A\nr e c e n t\ns u r v e y\nconducted\nb y A c c e n t u r e\nshowed that over 70% of consumers\nare willing to pay more for products from\ncompanies with a solid reputation for\nsocial and environmental responsibility.\nBy utilizing blockchain, brands can offer\ncustomers thorough information about\nthe product\u2019s journey, from raw materials to\nmanufacturing and working conditions. A brand that\nhas embraced blockchain for transparency is BREEZ, a\nsustainable fashion brand that uses blockchain to track\nthe origin and production of their clothing.\nAnother plus of blockchain in the fashion\nindustry is its ability to address the issue\nof counterfeiting. Counterfeit goods are a\nsignificant challenge for the fashion industry,\nwith a global market value estimated at\n$450 billion (according to the International\nTrademark Association). Blockchain can help\ntackle this problem by creating a secure and\nunchanging record of ownership and authenticity.\nEach item is attached with a unique digital certificate,\nproviding a verifiable history of its authenticity.\nMoreover, blockchain technology has the potential\nto revolutionize the way the fashion industry operates.\nTokenized fashion items, digital representations of\nphysical fashion items, are an example of this change.\nThese tokens can be bought, sold, and traded\nlike traditional assets, allowing customers to\nown a piece of fashion history. In fact, a recent\nauction saw a tokenized piece of fashion sell\nfor $100,000, showcasing the potential of this\ntechnology.\nA report by Grand View Research predicts\nthat the global blockchain market in the fashion\nindustry will grow at a compound annual growth\nrate (CAGR) of 63.8% from 2020 to 2027, reaching\na market size of $955.8 million by 2027. The rising\nadoption of blockchain in the fashion industry can be\nattributedtoitsabilitytoincreasetransparency,combat\ncounterfeiting, and improve the overall customer\nexperience.\nAlthough integrating blockchain in the fashion\nindustry presents several benefits, there are still\nobstacles to overcome. One of the primary challenges is\nthe need for widespread adoption and standardization\nof blockchain technology. Some fashion companies are\njust starting to explore\nblockchain\nand\nm a y\nrequire time\nand investment to\nfully take advantage of\nits benefits. Another\nchallenge is the lack\nof technical knowledge\nand expertise in the fashion\nindustry, as blockchain technology\ncan be complex and challenging for those without a\nbackground in technology.\nIn conclusion, the fashion industry\nis leading the charge in the blockchain\nrevolution, offering transparency, combating\ncounterfeiting, and changing the way the\nindustry operates. While there are still\nchallenges to face, the potential benefits\nof blockchain technology are undeniable,\nand it\u2019s clear that this technology will play a\ncrucial role in shaping the future of the fashion\nindustry.\nBlockchain is the new black\nAccording to IBM, \u201cBlockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset\ncan be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a\nblockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.\u201d\nWHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?\nKiara Rao Writer\nFRIDAY 4TH MARCH 2022\n40 Investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBusiness\nAccording to IBM, \u201cbusiness runs on information. The faster it\u2019s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information\nbecause it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network\nmembers. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all\ndetails of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.\u201d\nWHY IS BLOCKCHAIN IMPORTANT?\nCredits: Uxwing.\nCredits: Uxwing.co.uk\nCredits: betweenconscious.com\nEdited by: Charlotte Probstel\nBUSINESS\n\n"

    "content": "Another election cycle has drawn to a\nclose, with five new Officer Trustees\n(OTs) appointed for the 2023/24 year.\nWhat is striking about this year\u2019s\nelections is the dearth of experienced\ncandidates for OT positions.\nCamille Boutrolle comes to the role\nof Imperial College Union (ICU)\nPresident with the least experience\nof anyone to hold the role for\nseveral years. The officeholder this\nyear, Hayley Wong, served for two\nterms as President of the City and\nGuilds Union, and as an academic\nrepresentative before that.\nWong\u2019s predecessor, Lloyd James,\nhad an even more extensive record,\nhaving served as President of the Royal\nCollege of Science Union, Union\nCouncil Chair, and Student Trustee,\nbefore becoming ICU President.\nIn response to questioning about\nher lack of experience for the role,\nBoutrolle rebutted that she had\nbeen similarly unprepared for her\ntwo previously held positions (IC\nSnowsports Trip Secretary and\nPresident of IC Netball), and this had\nnot prevented her from performing\nwell.\nThose who have worked with her\nsay she is a competent, firm leader \u2013\nqualities which may well enable her\nto flourish. She takes up the mantle of\nICU President with a strong mandate,\nhaving achieved a resounding majority\nin the leadership election \u2013 though\nadmittedly, it was not a particularly\ncrowded field, with two out of the four\ncontenders being \u2018joke\u2019 candidates.\nLast issue, Felix noted that, for\nsomeone running for Union President,\nBoutrolle\u2019s manifesto makes very little\nmention of the Union itself, the very\norganisation she would be running.\nOne former Deputy President who\nspoke to us suggested that a \u2018handsoff \u2019 approach from the ICU President\ncan be beneficial when it comes to\nchanges within the Union. It lets the\nfour Deputy Presidents work towards\nachieving their own goals without\nthe interference of an overbearing\nsuperior.\nThissameindividualsuggestedthatthe\nICU President has a lot more freedom\nto define the focus of their role. Unlike\nthe Deputy Presidents, the Union\nPresident is not restricted to a specific\nportfolio. This leaves them with more\nscope to pursue changes as they see\nfit \u2013 whether that be pursuing reform\nwithin the Union itself, or lobbying\nthe College as Boutrolle appears set to\ndo.\nBe that as it may, it is imperative\nthat Boutrolle formulates and\ncommunicates her OT team\u2019s plans\nfor the coming year. \u201cWe all agree\nthe Union should do better\u201d, her\nmanifestoboldlyproclaimed.Nowshe\nis an officer-elect, the task falls to her\nto set out to students how she plans to\nimprove it.\nIn the post of Deputy President\n(Education) next year is Yi Yang.\nNever in our time at Imperial did we\nexpect to see a candidate running\nfor any position (let alone Deputy\nPresident) citing their experience on\na \u2018Mums and Dads\u2019 scheme as a reason\nfor election. Yet Yi Yang has done just\nthis, and actually won. In fact, she beat\nthe current holder of the role, who was\nrunning for a second term \u2013 and by\nmost accounts, is doing an excellent\njob in his first term.\nYang goes on in her manifesto\nto describe campaigns she has\nparticipated in as Gender Equality\nOfficer(GEO).Shecreditsherselfwith\nlaunching the successful campaign for\n\u2018free period products on all floors\u2019.\nFelix should point out that in fact, this\npush started before Yang commenced\nher term as GEO.\nFurthermore, Felix must question how\nany of this relates to the Education\nportfolio; Yang does not appear to\nhave served as any form of academic\nrep, and whilst this paper is all for\naccessibility, one would expect\nsome evidence of Education-related\nexperience.\nYang\u2019s election, Felix would argue,\nspeaks to the importance of\nconsidering the international student\ncommunityandtheuniqueproblemsit\nisfacing.Imperial\u2019smostrecentannual\nreport provides a breakdown of its\ndemographic. International students\nmake up half of the College\u2019s student\npopulation \u2013 Chinese students alone\naccount for a quarter of the student\nbody. What sets Yang\u2019s campaign\napart from those of her competitors\nis her appeal to international students\n\u2013 take, for example, her promise to\ncampaign against the steep rise in\noverseas tuition fees \u2013 a major source\nof concern for those coming from\nabroad.\nOnly time will tell how next year\u2019s OTs\nperform. We here at Felix congratulate\nthem on their election and wish them\nevery success.\n2\nJamie John NewsEditor\nIsabella Ward\nNewsEditor\nSportand\nSocietiesEditor\nAngie Lo ScienceEditor\nTaylor Pomfret ScienceEditor\nMarie Mori\nEnvironment\nEditor\nSimran Patel\nEnvironment\nEditor\nElif Civelekoglu\nComment\nEditor\nIsaac Winson PuzzlesEditor\nAmy Smith CatnipEditor\nGilbert Jackson ArtsEditor\nSophie Pointon ArtsEditor\nZanna Buckland BooksEditor\nJoe Riordan MusicEditor\nTara Palchaudhuri MusicEditor\nJonah Hewett\nFilmandTV\nEditor\nMike Buzadji\nFilmandTV\nEditor\nCharlotte Probstel\nFoodandTravel\nEditor\nSportand\nSocietiesEditor\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of:\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors!\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nOn the new OTs\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton, Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2023\nIllustraton by Nicolas Geiseler Toran\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 24TH MARCH 2023\n45\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nIC takes narrow victory in Netball 4s game\nSaturday morning saw the 4s from IC\nand ICSM Netball face each other.\nSome of the players, at least for IC,\nhad never even played before October.\nThrough training weekly and playing in the London Universities Sport\nLeagues, they have picked up the rules\nand rhythm of the game and, by the\ntime the Imperial Varsity rolls around,\nshowcase fluid gameplay.\nThis drew a crowd of supporters to\nwatch, despite the rain, and it proved\nto be an engrossing game. Both teams\nstarted strong but the Medics took\nan early lead. Strong defence from\nIC Goal Defence and team captain\nHannah, and quick conversions of the\nteam\u2019s own centre pass to a goal \u2013 much\nowed to the incredible stamina of Centre Bea \u2013 narrowed the gap, and at the\nend of the first quarter, the Medics were\nonly up 9-8.\nFrom the strong show put on by IC by\nthe end of the first quarter, it was clear\nto them that they were in with a shot of\nwinning, and, reinvigorated, returned\nready to put up a good fight. The attack\nsharpened, and Goal Shooter Emma\nand Goal Attack Vivienne became more\ndaring with their movement and shots,\nevading their defenders with ease and\ncreating more opportunities to get the\nball into the circle. The shooting accuracy was admirable and the performance\nput on by Vivienne earned her Player\nof the Match. The tremendous effort\nbrought the score to 16-14 to IC.\nThroughout the third quarter, the\nteams remained neck and neck. Each\ngoal was hotly contested, and pressure\nwas mounting from the supporters on\nthe sidelines. The Medics' defence took\nfull advantage of missed goals with\na notable sense of urgency, trying to\nclear out their defensive end as quickly\nas possible. They were not met without\nresistance, however; in one instance,\nmomentum for the Medics following a\nrebound in the IC attacking circle was\ndestroyed by an outstanding interception from IC Wing Defence Mariam,\nwho, having plucked the ball out the air\nmidway through its trajectory into the\nMedics\u2019 attacking third, quickly sent it\nback down the court. The exhausting\n15 minutes concluded in a draw for that\nquarter, meaning IC kept their two-goal\nlead.\nIn the final quarter, the Medics stayed\nhot on their heels and at one point IC\nonly led by a single goal. Having to fight\nso fiercely made for a gruelling game,\nbut the encouragement from supporters\non the sidelines cheering on (and only\nminorly heckling) the teams motivated\nplayers to keep going. The impressive\nand close standard of gameplay made for\nan enthralling watch for us spectators.\nIC did eventually manage\nto re-establish\ntheir two-goal\nlead, but such\nwas the sustained high energy of the Medics\u2019 attack that\nthis did not give\nIC any breathing space. When\nthe final whistle\nwent, cementing an end score\nof 34-32, there\nwas audible relief from IC that\nthey had managed to fend off\nthe Medics for\nlong enough.\nAs supporters\nrushed to congratulate both teams on their play and\nthe captains popped their customary\nbottles of prosecco, it was written on the\nfaces of the players that this was a fantastic way to conclude the season.\nSimultaneously, the 5s had been playing on the adjacent court. The Medics\nmade for a powerful opposition, with\ngreat defense making it difficult for IC\nto score. They capitalised on this and patiently worked the ball down the court\nand safely into their shooting circle, securing a well-deserved win and making\nfor celebrations all-round.\nTeam captain Hannah puts on pressure in the ICSM attacking circle.\nSaturday saw ICSM scramble to close the gap, but to\nno avail, as IC won 15 points to ICSM's 12, concluding the Imperial Varsity with a 27-12 victory for IC.\nOn the Netball court, ICSM nearly had a clean\nsweep of victories across all five teams, marred only\nby a close IC victory for the 4s. Nextdoor, however,\nICSM fared less well as wins in both the Tennis 1s and\n2s games went to IC .\nICSM Men's Lacrosse 1s, Rugby 1s, and Football 1s\nand 2s won their\ngames, as did\nWomen's Touch\nRugby, whilst victories went to IC in\nMixed and Women's Lacrosse, as well\nas Women's, Men's 3s and 4s Football.\nResults for headliners Hockey were\nalso a mixed bag, as ICSM won\nt h e Women's 1s and 3s games\nwhilst victories for the Women's 2s and\nMen's 2s, 3s and 4s went to IC.

That is what Gabriel, a recently\ngraduated p\u00e2tisserie chef, taught us when\nwe visited Paris for the weekend. The world\nof p\u00e2tisseries circling the city is in fact very\nsmall. Most chefs know each other, or know\na friend that knows the person they wish to\ncontact. Our friend Gabriel could lead us\nto the good p\u00e2tisseries, as he could confirm\nthe dignity and qualities of the head chefs.\nHe knew where we could find the croissants\nwhereyoucouldtastethebutter,hearthelay-erscrunchasyoubitintothedelights,andsee\na matrix of dough breathing underneath the\ngoldencrust.\nAs we sat along the Seine, munching on\ncroissants, pain au chocolat, and pain au\nraisin, we enjoyed the view of the classical\nbuildings on the opposite bank. Paris was\nnot bombarded in the Second World War,\nso most architectural establishments are\nstill alive \u2014 evident in the slightly wonky\nbuildings that gated some small alleys. We\nwould look up, and the sky was bordered by\nanythingotherthantwoparallellines.\nThe sidewalks were wide enough for\nbicyclists, joggers, grandparents, and\nyoung children to have their own\nlane. Along the river banks were no\nshortages of joggers \u2014 but there\nwere plenty of bridges, so there\nwas little traffic to cross the river.\nMy friend and I, both students in London,\nparticularly enjoyed the space. Within\nthe metropolitan city, there was room for\ntrees, gardens, playgrounds, and \u2014 most\nimportantly \u2014 pedestrian zones, so that\npeoplecouldwalkmore.\nInstead of trying to see as many events as\npossible, we enjoyed walking through the\ntown. From the Latin Quarter, near where\ntheconstructionoftheNotreDameistaking\nplace,wewalkedtowardstheL`Orangerie\u2014\na museum famous for hosting Monet\u2019s water\nlilies. There, we turned left towards la Place\ndeConcorde,wheretheObeliskfromEgypt\nis placed and which ends at the L\u2019Arc de\nTriomphe. The cafes were filled with people\ntalking and drinking a proper caf\u00e9 \u2014 a small\nceramic cup with black coffee. If you ask for\ncoffee,that\u2019swhatyou\u00b4llget.Theydon\u2019tserve\nlattes, iced coffees, or triple-shot caramel-frappucinoswithtwovanillapumps.\nThat weekend was Paris Fashion Week,\nbut it wasn\u2019t noticeable. We hoped to run\ninto a model, but there was no luck. We ran\ninto plenty of possible scammers, but all I\nthought was \u201cc\u2019est la vie\u201d. Large\nEuropean cities are\nfilled with many very\ncreative scams, and\nhere are a few to\nwatch out for.\nA person\nm a y\nt a k e\nyour\nhand and\nstart braiding a friendship bracelet\naround your wrist, while indulging in a\ncommon conversation with you. Once\nthe bracelet is finished, you can\u2019t take it off\nwithout breaking it \u2014 so they will ask for\npaymentduetotheirservice.Protectyourself\nby yelling \u201cNon, ne me touche pas\u201d (\u201cNo, do\nnot touch me\u201d). The classic free roses and\nanything valuable found on the floor (ring,\nwallet) are quite common, so keep valuables\nalways in sight or well hidden and protected.\nThe meanest scam is when people pickpocket you while convincing you to sign a\npetition.\nAs an example, we walked past people\nwho checked out my dad. Not because he is\nincredibly handsome \u2014 which he is \u2014 but\nbecause of his back pockets. My dad has a\ntendency of keeping his phone in the back\npocket of his rather visible jeans. My friend\npointed it out and I took the phone and put\nit in my bag. I did this multiple times, as he\nkeptonforgettingabouthispocket.Oncehe\nforgot I had it, his freaked\nreaction\nwas worth a\nmillion trips\nto Paris. For\nonce, the roles\nwerereversed.\nThe Dior\nMuseum was\nunfortunately sold\nout, but the \u2018Mus\u00e9e des Arts\nD\u00e9coratifs\u2019soldticketstoanexhibitionofthe\n1980s.Thefashionwasexquisite.Sinceitwas\nan era where restrictions on free speech and\ncreativeexpressionwerelifted,theFrenchart\nworld exploded.

I found\nthe commercials\nhumorous, but very\ndifferent from the adverts we\nsee nowadays for insurance\n\u2014 or even a simple bag of\nM&Ms. My dad, the only one in our\ngroup alive in the 80s, didn\u2019t\nrecognize anything besides the\npurple jacket with the padded\nshoulders as large as a life vest. If\nTitanic had happened in the 80s,\nJack\u00b4sjacketwouldhavesavedbothhim\nandRose.\nThere are many more unique events,\nexhibitions, buildings, shops, and quarters\nto explore in Paris \u2014 I would recommend\ngoingwhenyouhavethechance.Bookahead\nto save money and use the metro. A single\nticket (regardless of line and zone) will cost\nyou \u20ac1.30, so transport is no problem. The\nmetro is clean and safe. There are hotels in\nabundance and restaurants or food corners\nareeverywhere.\nOverall, the trip was a wonderful break\nfrom our studies and our daily routine.\nWe ate excellent food, spoke with many\npeople, witnessed some classic road rage\nwhile sipping on our coffees, and enjoyed\nthe artistic feats of Monet and Matisse while\nteaching my friend from London as many\nfrench words as we could.

Shops like these\nare plentiful in the \u2018Quartier Asiatique\u2019 of\nParis, an area between the Seine and the\nsouthern edge of the city. The district is not\njust a Chinatown, because the place is a real\nmash of locals and immigrants mainly from\nVietnam, Laos, Cambodia and China who\nhave populated the area. The display cards\nin the bakery in front of each variety of\nbaked goods, were in French, (traditional)\nChinese and Vietnamese \u2014 in that order.\nSometimes when I travel, I yearn to get\naneyeofthemainsites,towalkonthegrand\ntree-lined boulevards, or to inspect the\ntreasures hidden in their museums.

Stripped of the casinos, traffic,\nand crowds, I could hear the gentle chitchat\nof locals, in a variety of dialects, who seemed\nto be strolling home from a supermarket\nrun. There was a\nwhole ecosystem\nhere. Apart from the\nChinese bakery, there\nwere Vietnamese\nrestaurants selling\npho, local estate\nagents, a Japanese\ncomic shop, and a\nTaiwanese dessert\nplace.

As\nwell as threatening the planet, EACOP\nhas been called a \u201cgross violation of\nhuman rights\u201d by Ugandan opposition\nleader Bobi Wine. Building the pipe\nrequires destroying land which the pipe\nruns under \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2014 this could displace at\nleast 100,000 people. In October of last\nyear, nine Ugandan university students\nwho were protesting against the project\nwere arrested, and other human rights\ndefenders are being intimidated.\nBecause the pipeline is so long, a\nleak to never occur anywhere along the\npipe is near impossible. Leaks put local\npeople and wildlife at risk of becoming\nextremely sick from contamination.\nLake Albert provides around a third\nof Uganda\u2019s fish, and borders the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, so a\nleak in the tiny portion that spans Lake\nAlbert could have devastating knock-on effects. The risk of EACOP leaking\nis magnified by the potential seismic\npressure on pipes during an earthquake.\nAlthough rare, Tanzania\u2019s earthquakes\nin the past have been of high magnitude,\nmaking these pipes vulnerable to\nearthquake-induced leaks.\nThe EACOP website claims the\nproject can achieve \u201cno net loss of\nnatural habitats and a net gain in critical\nhabitats\u201d, by publicising that the pipeline\ndoes not run through Lake Victoria.\nHowever, many underappreciated\nbiodiversity-rich regions are sure to\nbe impacted. The largest and oldest\nnatural park in Uganda, Murchison\nFalls, could be exploited for this project.\nThe end point of the pipeline happens\nto be the Chongoleani Peninsula near\nTanzania\u2019s Tanga Port, which is a very\nsensitive coastal region. This area hosts\nan abundance of marine reserves,\nmangroves, and coral. According to\nFlora & Fauna International, Tanzania is\nhome to 6 out of 25 globally recognised\nbiodiversity hotspots. 43% of the\nplant species of the coastal forests of\nEastern Africa are endemic, i.e. they are\nessentially irreplaceable. At this point in\nthe pipeline, the pipes can be hundreds\nof metres below sea level, with many\ncrude oil tanks off the coast. An oil spill\ninanarealikethiscouldhaveirreversible\neffects on marine life.\nIt is imperative to act now against this\nticking time bomb, as it is still not too\nlate to combat the project. With recent\nnews of the ozone hole gradually getting\nsmaller after the world came together\nto abandon CFCs in aerosols, we now\nknow that it is possible to reverse some\nof the man-made damage done to the\nplanet. TotalEnergies does not yet have\nenough funding to go ahead with the\nproject because many banks and insurers\nhave refused to insure the project. This\nis not only due to the number of risks\nthat go hand-in-hand with projects like\nthis, but also because activist groups like\nStopEACOP and a generation of young,\nplanet-friendly potential investment\nbankers are putting their reputations at\nrisk. So far, 24 commercial banks and 22\ninsurance companies have opted out of\nsupporting EACOP, but there are still\nmore to go.\nDuetotheharshtreatmentofactivists\nthat have protested against the project,\nparticularly in Uganda, it is essential\nthat we use our voices to help protest\nagainst it in any way we can. As many\npeople in this country do not know\nabout the EACOP project or why the\nextraction of fossil fuels does not meet\ncriteria of the Paris Agreement, a simple\nway to get involved in the StopEACOP\nmovement is to spread awareness.\nSince Lloyds is located in London,\nmore proactive local activists are taking\nphysical action outside of their building\nand engaging with employees about\nthe project, which is proving to be very\neffective. StopEACOP London is also\nparticipating in a phone campaign, in\nwhich activists are calling insurance\ncompanies during office hours to discuss\nthe impacts of this project.\nStop polluting, stop EACOP\nenvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nTasha Wheeler Environment Writer\nFRIDAY 24TH MARCH 2023\n11\nEdited by: Simran Patel\nMarie Mori\nEnvironmentt\nENVIRONMENT\nThe pressure is on for London\u2019s banks and insurers to prevent the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) from proceeding.\nCredit: Romane Aud\u00e9oud\nFollow the\nmovement on\nInstagram!\n@stopeacop\nfor more information\non the campaign as a\nwhole\n@letsstopeacopuk\nto join the Whatsapp\nchat and get involved in\nthe London campaign\nEACOP protestors outside Standard Chartered Bank building.\n\n"

You arrive at campus, satisfied\nwith having learned something new before the first class of the day starts.\nCatering or non-catering? On-Campus or Off-Campus? Living alone or with flatmates?\nAnouk Stricher and Laura\nMalaussene share their answers\nto those questions in their up-and-coming podcast \u201cInternational Students Voices\u201d (ISV),\nwhere they discuss their experience as international students\nin the UK.

They noticed there was\nvery little content giving international\nstudents advice and guidance in a fun,\nentertaining and concise manner. They\ninvestigated the biggest issues that first-year undergraduates experience, such as\nhousing, degree change, and part-time\njobs by reading the 50 replies to their\nsurvey. Fast-forward to their graduation\nsummer and their first episode was released in September 2022.

Otherwise, the leading team organizes work-shops, where they look into different\npoetic styles, watch a few performanc-es, discuss the poems and dive into\nconversations about metaphysical abstraction and how poets abstract themselves from the world and their bodies.\nIf you love reading, writing, and/or\neye-opening abstract discussion, then\nthe Poetry Society may be the place for\nyou.

    "content": "question which could have made for\na good opportunity to show off the\nprogress made over the past year.\nHowever, his answer failed to\nhighlight any tangible developments\nalready made. Three months away from\nthe end of his term, it seems unlikely\nthat he will be able to see any significant\nchange through. Perhaps Deputy\nPresidents are lumped with too many\nadministrative tasks, or perhaps the\nCollege needs to work better alongside\nthe Union to implement policy within\nshorter timeframes. Another option is\nto increase the length of tenure. Whilst\nthe longer commitment could mean\nthat there would be fewer candidates\nrunning for the roles, those who\ndid would probably be considerably\nmore competent and have a proven\nvocational desire to lead the Union.\nLater,theUnionPresidentcandidates\u2019\nresponses on how they would alleviate\nthe pressures of the cost-of-living crisis\nfor students don\u2019t offer any hope that\nchange may occur more rapidly. Camille\nBoutrolle answers that she would\n\u201cestablish what students need\u201d and act\naccordingly. It\u2019s a true politician\u2019s answer\n\u2013 vague and incomplete \u2013 but let\u2019s give\nherthebenefitofthedoubtthatthisisn\u2019t\njust a cover for inadequate preparation.\nWith her position beginning in mid-July,thisinitialresearchphasewouldnot\nbe completed by September at very least.\nBy that point, students would have been\nexperiencing the crisis for a year.

When questioned\non this they take different approaches.\nAleksei waves it aside as \u201cthe only box\n[he] has not ticked\u201d, having been Vice\nPresident of Electrical Engineering\nSociety and Sports Sector Treasurer,\nwhilst Camille concedes that she does\nnot have the experience, but that she\ndidn\u2019t either when she took on the role\nof Netball President (due to her lack of\nexperience with the normal operations\nof the club thanks to COVID-19)\nand was still able to succeed.\nNeither is a satisfying answer (it\u2019s\na pretty crucial box), but Camille\nhas raised an interesting point: is the\npandemic to blame for such disinterest\namongst students and inexperienced\ncandidates? In 2021/22, restrictions\nmeant few CSPs operated normally\nand the Union building was mostly\nshut; students would have had little\ninteraction with the workings of the\nUnion. Is the inexperience and lack\nof engagement from third and fourth\nyear students due to this? Indeed, this\nyear\u2019s voting turnout of 22.70% was\nseven percentage points lower than last\nyear\u2019s. Even at Union Council meetings,\nwhilst there have been a few standout\npeople showcasing a clear desire to\ntangibly improve the experiences of\nstudents during their tenure, most\nstudent body representatives just\nseem disinterested and disengaged.\nRegardless, both Union President\ncandidates are clearly out of their\ndepth. There is a demonstrated lack\nof understanding in the actual role of\nthe Union President, which Aleksei\nattributes to there being \u201cno job\ndescription for Union President\u201d. So\nwhy would they apply to a job with no\ndescription?Forthetitle?Forthepower?\nIs it the management experience?

Voting has\nbeen open for over four hours.\nNext to me sits Andreea Cojocea,\ncontestant for Deputy President\n(Welfare), a role \u2018responsible for driving\npermanent and student-led change\nto College\u2019s culture to make Imperial\na welcoming and supportive place to\nstudy,\u2019 with a salary of circa \u00a335k. Her\nopponent is not present, meaning\nAndreea is the only one of the two who\nmustrespondtoquestionsabouttherole\nand her manifesto on the spot. This can\nbedauntinganddifficult,andinprinciple\nit seems unfair that only Andreea\nshould be put to this test without\nany consequence for the absentee.\nIn reality, few people are watching.\nThe 30-strong audience consists almost\nentirely of either other candidates\nwaiting for their turn, or friends of the\ncandidates. Not that Andreea can see\nthem: both of us are blinded by fierce\nwhite light which I suppose makes for a\nclearerimageontheInstagramlivestream.\nThe event garners little interest there\ntoo. Students such as myself have been\nstaying away from Instagram recently\nas our feed has become a landfill of\ncampaign accounts that I only followed\nout of fear of rudeness. Candidates are\nonly allowed to begin campaigning\nless than five days before voting opens,\nso these accounts are short-lived.\nFurthermore, the fact that I am\nnot allowed to comment on or query\ncandidates\u2019 responses significantly\nreduces the likelihood that they will be\nunderminedduringtheevent,asitenables\nthem to get away with unsatisfying, or\neven just factually incorrect, responses.\nHustings is an opportunity to\nquestion those running in the Union\nLeadership Elections for the positions\nof Council Chair, Deputy Presidents\nfor Welfare, Financial Services, Clubs\nand Societies, and Education, and\nUnion President. Students can send in\nquestions for candidates, grilling them\non anything from their past experience\nto their future plans and promises laid\nout in their manifesto, and how they will\nkeep them. Yet so few questions have\nbeen sent in that almost all questions\nhave been written by the Felix editorial\nteam. It seems that students don\u2019t have\nquestions and don\u2019t want answers.\nWhen I last checked, at 4 p.m. that day\n\u2013 two hours before hustings begins \u2013\nnearly 30% of the final voting turnout\nhad already cast their virtual ballots.\nAll this makes one believe that\nstudents simply don\u2019t care about their\nUnion leadership team. But if they don\u2019t\ncare, then why are they voting at all?\nPerhaps they care more about\npersonality and less about competence.\nJoke Union President candidate, Ioana\n\u2018Christine\u2019 Gavrilescu is running this\nyeartoshowhoweasyitistobeendorsed\nby people of influence within the Union,\ndespite clearly being unfit for the role.\nHer campaign Instagram account boasts\nendorsements from the DPFS, as well\nas the RCSU and CGCU Presidents.\nEither way, I believe that the lack\nof want to vet the competence of\ncandidates reveals students\u2019 doubt in\ntheir candidate\u2019s capability to make a\nmeaningful change. And perhaps this is\nwarranted. On Tuesday, I asked the rerunning DPE how he had progressed\nwith his manifesto from last year.\nAfter the hustings, I overheard him\nsay, \u201cthat was brutal\u201d. But it shouldn\u2019t\nhave been; it was a straightforward\nWhat does the Union President do anyway,\nand who cares?\nIsabella Ward Co-Editor-in-Chief\nALL THIS MAKES\nONE BELIEVE THAT\nSTUDENTS DON\u2019T\nCARE ABOUT\nTHEIR LEADERSHIP\nTEAM.

I witnessed the openness later that night at their Open Mic\nNight when I performed two self-writ-ten poems and received kind applause.\nCompared to LSE and Kings, which\noffer economics, law, literature, and various other related subjects, Imperial is\n\u201cisolated because [it] has no humanities\n[courses]. We are locked in the STEM\natmosphere. It is a bit cold,\u201d said Onali.\nThat is why she is aiming to build a community of poetry societies from other\nLondon Universities such that members\ncan exchange poetry with English stu-dents. Despite our lack of a Literature\nDepartment, Onali pointed out that \u201cat\nImperial, we have more range in the poetry because so many members pursue\nit themselves.\u201d It is not taught in school\nor driven by a teacher. It is original and\nunique. It is also completely voluntary,\nmeaning the students can just close their\neyes and relish in meaningful words,\nand allusions to other poets and enjoy\nthe rhythm of an iambic pentameter.\n\u201cThe very last thing poetry is is a\npoem.\u201d (The Wind in the Willows, Zaffar\nKunial), read Sophie, one of the members at the open mic night. Dan echoed\na similar point when he commented:\n\u201cPowerful images are indirect. When\nyou say things clearly, they are not im-pactful. Saying the truth is boring. To\nmake it art, you alter your speech to make it hidden, deep,\nand intense, but you risk obscurity. You\nmay conjure different images. Otherwise, the reader will feel something new.\nIt's not about telling a fact or providing\ninformation; ist always about the experience of art. I cannot put it into words.\nArt is always much more than its origin.\u201d\nOnali continued by stating that\npoetry has \u201cthe poten-tialtoexposeyoualot.You\ncan obscure your meaning or not. Does it make it more\nexpressive when you obscure your\nwork? I find my lines very expressive.\nPoetry can be more than what it evokes.\u201d\nMost readers will have experienced\nreadingoranalyzingsomepoetryinhigh\nschool and found a lack of interest. Dan\ntouched upon that subject saying, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t take English seriously academical-ly. Poetry didn\u2019t speak in class. The war\npoetry [I studied] in class was redundant because students were reluctant to\nlisten. It is only when you experience poetryonyourown,thatyouappreciateit.\u201d\nPoetry surrounds us humans more than\nwe realize. Dan and Onali both found\nroots in songwriting. Next time you listen to a song and can hear the lyrics, you\nrealise the words mean much more as a\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n46 sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSOCIETIES\nSAYING THE\nTRUTH IS\nBORING.

There was a garden\nI vaguely remember, the way the leaves curtained\nlike shadows. A lit cave. A fringe, not yours, you could\nlook through. And the wood that grew by flowing water\ncarved cricket bats, which was a part of the little I also knew.\nMaybe it was all a little to do with letters too, the tongueless\ntrees of that printed double l, or the uncrowing tall Ws\nof The Wind in the Willows; maybe it was all aural \u2013\nan echoed \u2018in\u2019, Wind in... the open-mouthed billowy lows\n\u2013 maybe the leaf-fringed mystery, between the two.\nAnd speaking of poetry, I had this initiating thought: in\nthe flax-smelling grain of the first bat I was gifted\nwind was contained. Old power locked. A gravity well\nbeyond mine. Light enough, slight arms could lift it. Wind\nin willow, this percussive wood a gathered strength. A mutual\nbind.

The venue has previously housed a range of\nLondon\u2019s up-and-comers, from Otto Von Skidmark\u2019s shitty one-man\nshow to the critically acclaimed Take That tribute band, And That. Some\ntruly tough acts to follow, but I was practically moist with anticipation\nas I waited for the doors to open.\nOn entering the theatre each audience member was handed a copy\nof The Old Man and the Sea, with sentences arranged in alphabetical\norder. Nothing was said about it during the show but I later read online\nthat it was a commentary on the plight of Afghan women under Taliban\nrule, and I think this was a very brave and poignant statement. Having\nnodded thoughtfully while flipping through the pages, I settled back\ninto my chair and waited for the play to begin.\nThe majority of the performance was dedicated to a blind man\nattempting to give himself a splinter by rubbing his hand on a wooden\ntabletop in a remarkable display of method acting. Personally I might\nhave simply pretended that I got a splinter, but I suppose that\u2019s the\ndifference between me and a real actor. And while this hiccough did\nimpact the pacing of the show, things really picked up in the second\nhalf with the steamy love story of the Roman governor and the DefenceAgainst-the-Dark-Arts teacher. The climax of the performance was\nmarred slightly by the unfortunate angle of Pontius\u2019 wand meaning\nthat some of his spell landed on the shoes of a woman in the front row.\nTurns out it\u2019s not just Dog\u2019s Trust that can catch strays.\nOverall, I enjoyed the show despite its imperfections. At the very least, I\nconsider it our duty to support the hardworking actors in independent\nproductions, especially when the government itself is doing so little to\nhelp with the long-term unemployed.\nCATNIP\n\n"

The city\ncharms and warms,\nwith yellow and orange\nbuildings lining the\ncosy cobbled city-centre\nstreets. A bit further\naway is Usera, which\nhouses one of the few\nthemed metro stations\nof Madrid (the other\nbeing in Chueca, known\nas the gay district). Red\nwallpaper adorned the\nwalls of the passageways\nof this station, from\nthe ground level to the\nplatform that is deep\nunderground. Lining\nthe walls \u2014 apart from\nthe meandering dragons\nand lanterns \u2014 were\nrecurring unifying\nmotifs of \u201cMetro somos\ntodos\u201d(Metroweareall).\nImmigration\nfrom China to Spain\nhas been recent, and\nmostly driven by\nsocioeconomic factors.\nUsera is now Madrid\u2019s\nunofficial Chinatown.\nCultural integration is\na hard yet important\npart of moving to\nanother country, but\nunfortunately is made\nmore difficult by\ncultural and language\nbarriers. Common to many people who\nmove abroad are, unfortunately, stereotypes\nand microaggressions that may undermine\nsincere efforts to assimilate. The station\nart might not mean much to me, but\nI\u2019m sure it will carry more weight to the\ngenerations of immigrants living in the area.\nBeing south of all the major sites and a\nwalk across the river Manzanares, Usera\nis one of the places that you wouldn\u2019t just\nstumble across randomly. Food has a great\npart in cultural exchange, and is usually a\ngood reason to visit an area with diverse\ninhabitants. Indeed, for some immigrants,\none of the most immediately marketable\nskills is the culinary craft of a foreign\nplace thousands of miles away. Before\nmy trip, I was talking to a Spaniard,\nhoping to get advice for local food to try.\nTo me, she replied, \u201cwhat\u2019s good about\ntapas? My favourite is Chinese food\u201d.\nAnother popular business for people\nwho have recently immigrated are corner\nshops \u2014 where you can buy basic drinks,\nfoodstuffs, and household items. In Spain,\nthis phenomenon is embedded into the\nlanguage \u2014 the name for these stores,\nin general, is \u2018el Chino\u2019, because the shop\nassistants are frequently of Chinese descent.\nRestaurants and stores were dotted\nalong the gridiron streets of Usera. Above\nthe restaurants were typically three floors of\nresidences, with balconies that overlooked\nthestreets.Clotheswerehungonthebalcony\nto dry in the hot and arid air of Madrid.\nSometimes residents were sitting on their\nbalconies, either on their phones or peering\ndown at the shuffling of people beneath.\nSwap the stores and the signs, and the\ndistrict would probably look like a general\nneighbourhood anywhere in the country.\nWhat was particularly memorable,\nhowever, was an unexpected encounter with\na shop next to the Plaza Mayor \u2014 the literal\nheart of Madrid. It was the combination\nof the verdant green fa\u00e7ade and the sign in\nglowing neon that caught my eye. At the\nstorefront was a poster advertising a popular\nricedishbackhome,\nwith a cheeky\nStephen Chow\nmovie reference\naccompanied by a\ncheesy slogan that\nwas a play on words\nin Cantonese.\n\u2018Restaurante Hong\nKong 70\u2019 pumped\na momentary surge\nof nostalgia through\nme that not many\nplaceshavebeenable\nto create.

    "content": "The final match of the Imperial-LSE\nVarsity saw the Men\u2019s rugby teams\nface each other under the floodlights at\nRosyln Park. The women\u2019s game just before had set an extraordinary precedent\nwith a 102-0 victory to IC, so even the\nwet conditions couldn\u2019t dampen the IC\nplayers\u2019 and supporters\u2019 spirits.\nA cagey start from both sides allowed\nthe first scrum of the game to come\naround early. Imperial pushed straight\nthrough LSE, with the front row of Sam\nJohnson,ChayBailey,andeventualPlayer of the Match Joe Berry decimating\ntheir counterparts. Imperial established\ntheir dominance quickly by winning the\nfirst penalty of the game.\nHowever, messy play ensued, with\nImperial fumbling opportunities, including several missed touch kicks. LSE\nwere quick to capitalise on a scrambling\nand disorganised IC defence. Following\na loose ball, and a chip through chased\nby winger Joe Mondadori, LSE were\nfirst to score in the corner, much to the\ndelight of their supporters. The conver-sion, however, was sent wide, sparing IC\nan extra two points.\nLSE kept momentum and were able\nto move up the pitch through a sequence\nof offsides. As per before though, the set\npiece proved to be an issue for them, as\nthey lost the maul from the lineout, and\nthen the consequent scrum. Remarkably\nresilient, the team rallied with enormous\nshots in defence, keeping IC around the\nhalfway line.\nEventually, pressure paid off from the\nIC attack, led by Ed Bruun and Archie\nRees, and IC were finally able to move\nup the pitch into the LSE 22-meter line.\nYet an impressive take in the lineout by\nFraser Reed was unfortunately quickly\nnegated by an offside penalty, and the\nprogress and distance was lost. Now\npinned on their own 5-meter line, IC\nlost their lineout, but scrambled in defence well to turn it over again.\nThe relief didn\u2019t last long as fly hacks\nthrough from dropped balls and a\nlong-lasting barrage of forwards attacks\nfrom LSE pinned IC on their line. IC\nbattled enormous pressure for several\nminutes but kept their cool and managed to escape with the score unscathed.\nFollowing a series of IC attacks that\nled nowhere, a penalty granted LSE an\nopportunity to kick for 3, which was yet\nagain missed, fortunately for IC. The\ntrench warfare-like slog for ground continued from both sides. The first break\nthrough for Imperial came following a\nsuperbly executed backs move, setting\nup winger Spencer Ingall to ride the momentum and go over the LSE line for a\ntry. A successful conversion secured Imperial a 7-5 lead.\nLSE struck back almost immediately,\nwith a try under the posts after a quick\ntap-and-go, and strong forward attack,\nconverted by Ounsley. There was little\ntime to celebrate, however, as IC exerted an incredible amount of pressure in\nLSE\u2019s 22-metre line following a ruthless\nattack from IC during an LSE lineout.\nThis culminated in Joe Berry going over\nthe whitewash, but a missed conversion\nmeant the teams were drawing 12-all at\nhalf time.\nImperial kicked off the second half,\nbut play was suspended whilst Spencer Ingall was substituted off following\nhis unfortunate injury, after a strong\nchase and monster tackle. LSE made the\nmost of more missed touch kicks from\nIC with a line break this time. Another prolonged period of forward attacks\nresulted in another try. Despite missing\nthe conversion, LSE took an early 12-17\nlead in the second half.\nImperial\u2019s scrum struggled initially,\nallowing a few opportunities and again\nmore kicks from LSE. Max Wang returned them well, providing some stability so that Imperial could regroup\nand show their form once again in their\nclassic lineout-mall combination. IC\npushed LSE back 15 metres until an\ninjury to Walter Taylor forced another\nlong break in play. When play resumed,\nthe attack from IC was repelled, but\nIC maintained momentum, loitering\nin LSE\u2019s half and launching attack after\nattack. Desperate to keep their\nlead however, LSE\ndemonstrated a\nmighty effort in\ndefence to absorb\nwave after wave of\npressure from IC.\nThe set piece\ncontinued to allow\nImperial a steady\nplatform to launch\nyet more attacks,\nwhen finally at 65\nminutes, a monumental maul ensued as the IC forwards walked LSE\nback from outside\ntheir 22-metre\nline, enabling captain Sean Nakai\nto score. A missed\nconversion meant\nthat, once again,\nthe teams were\nneck-to-neck at\n17-all.\nThe now reinvigorated LSE mounted\nthe pressure upon IC, who fought off\nLSE in their own half for the following\nten minutes but were able to keep them\nat bay. With five minutes on the clock,\nImperial won a series of penalties, allowing them to move up the pitch and\nback into the dominant position in the\ndying moments of the game. As time\nticked away, several tense lineouts and\nscrums fed into each other, resulting in\nan Imperial lineout on LSE\u2019s 5-metre\nline at the zeroth minute. The ball was\nfed perfectly by the replacement hooker\nOlly Tatlow to Fraser Reed, and the forwards attempted to crash over the line\nin a multitude of phases, but to no avail.\nThe ball appeared to be turned over, but\nmuch to the joy of the IC crowd, illegal-ly. Alex Mitchener took an awarded penalty in front of the posts and slotted the\nball home, bringing the end score to 20\n\u201317,withICtakingthewinforthethird\nyear in a row.\nOlly Tatlow The City Varsity Secretary\nNarrow victory for Imperial in Men's Rugby\nImperial beat LSE in The City Varsity for the third year in a row after penalty awarded in final minute.\nIC launch attack after attack.\nIC\nvs.\nLSE\n20-17\nLast lineout for final year Fraser.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n42 sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nCredit: Rolando Charles for Imperial Rugby\nCredit: Rolando Charles for Imperial Rugby\n\n"

First, there\u2019s developing\nnew galleries and exhibitions, being\nresponsible for their intellectual aspects.\nThen, there\u2019s managing the museum\u2019s\ncollections, and, lastly, performing\nacademic research with the collections\nas the basis.\nGoing behind the scenes\nConducting academic research\ninvolves managing the museum\u2019s\n'behind-the-scenes' collection\u2014all the\nstuff that currently isn\u2019t being exhibited.\nI ask what this hidden collection is like,\nand the first thing Alexandra tells me is\nthat it\u2019s absolutely huge.\n\u201cOnly around five percent of the\ncollections are on display at any one\ntime, which is quite mind-boggling,\u201d she\nsays. And as a curator, she\u2019s continuously\non the hunt for new objects to add to\nthe collection: both historical objects, as\nwell as objects from the present that may\none day be used in a future exhibit.\nSourcing artifacts\nThe objects come from all sorts of\nplaces: scientists will sometimes donate\nold equipment that\u2019s become obsolete,\nor individuals may donate antique\nscience-related objects.\nThey also purchase objects from\nauctions. As for contemporary objects,\ncurators often proactively approach\npeople and sources for them.\nOne of the fascinating parts of\nfiguring out what modern objects to\ncollect, says Alexandra, is having to step\nback. \u201cYou\u2019re always trying to look at it\nfrom the perspective of someone in the\nfuture.\u201d\nI ask if I\u2019d be able to peek at this\ncollection, but no luck: none of the\nhidden collection is located at the\nScience Museum.\nRight now, it\u2019s boxed up in a storage\nunit in Kensington, and is in the process\nof being moved to another facility just\noutside of Swindon.\nBut there\u2019ll be a chance to look in\nthe future: the Swindon centre will be\nopening its doors up to the public come\nearly 2024, and visitors can browse rows\nof stowed-away objects for the first time,\nlooking for interesting gems tucked\ninside.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a time to wait,\u201d says\nAlexandra., \u201cbut it will be an amazing\nfacility.\u201d Although they\u2019re not being\nexhibited, the objects of the behind-the-scenes collection have a vibrant life of\ntheir own.\nAs well as being used for academic\nresearch, the exhibits are also loaned\nout to other museums, and the Science\nMuseum invites other museum\nprofessionals to examine the objects too.\nFor Alexandra, doing research with\nthese objects is an especially fulfilling\npartofherjob.\u201c[By]tracing[anobject's]\nhistory, we\u2019re kind of like [in] a detective\nstory, piecing together its story. And it\u2019s\njust really satisfying when you find that\nlittle breakthrough.\u201d\nContinued on page 8...\nAngie Lo Science Editor\nEdited by: angie lo\ntaylor pomfret\nScience&Technology\nBehind the scenes at the Science Museum\nAngie Lo interviews curator Alexandra Rose on the Science Museum\u2019s various inner workings.\nThe Science Museum, London, as seen from Exhibition Road.

For some, this may be too little\ntoo late. Although the decision has\nbeen welcomed by Ethics for USS, a\nself-proclaimed \u2018group of USS members\ncommitted to reforming USS and\nensuring an investment strategy that\nprotects the planet, respects human\nrights, invests responsibly and ensures\ngood pensions\u2019, they told the Financial\nTimes, \u201cUSS also needs to stop funding\nall new fossil fuel developments and\nto divest immediately from fossil\nfuel companies that are not rapidly\ncutting emissions.\u201d The group runs the\nDivest USS campaign, which believes\nthat \u201cUSS\u2019s action to address the\nclimate emergency has been woefully\ninadequate\u201d and aims to rectify that by\npushing for reform.\nSubsidiary group Save Pensions and\nPlanet will attend the Court of Appeal\non 13 June with the hopes to hold\nUSS directors legally accountable for\nfailing to fulfil their duties. The appeal,\nfor which already over \u00a3381,000 has\nbeen crowdfunded to cover legal fees,\nmostly focuses on the pension cuts of\nApril 2022. However, it also hopes to\nhold USS to account to \u201cdivest fossil\nfuels with a plan that includes a credible\nshareholder voting policy for clean\nenergy in all companies\u201d.\nOrganisers argue that this is actually\nintrinsic to protecting their pensions,\nas it makes no economic sense to\ncontinue investing in fossil fuels. On the\nCrowdfunder page, they explain \u201cGas,\noil and coal were the worst performing\nassets in modern history; the 2022/23\nenergy crisis and price spikes simply\nunderlines their volatility, and they have\nno future.\u201d As of October 2022, the \u00a391\nbillion pension fund had holdings in 48\nleading fossil fuel companies.\nHence the appeal cites a \u201cfailure to\nact in beneficiaries' best interests by\nnot divesting from fossil fuels, even\nthough these are causing significant\nfinancial detriment: coal, oil and gas are\nthe worst performing asset class, they\nare destroying the ecosphere, and the\nbeneficiaries of USS have said they want\nto divest.\u201d\nIndeed,whentheappealwaslaunched\nin March last year, Save Pensions and\nPlanet highlighted \u201cthe failure of USS\nto [divest from fossil fuels] cost us\n\u00a3500,000,000 in write-offs from Russia's\nappalling invasion, and all because the\nfailed USS chair and directors had\ncareers in coal and fossil fueled banks.\u201d\nCurrently,USSinvestsover\u00a3570million\ninto fossil fuel companies.\nOrganisers write \u201cIf we get out of\nfossil fuels, our pension will not face\nmassive climate risks from bankrupt\nfossil fuels; it will be healthier, and so\nwill our planet.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an ambitious case \u2013 the \u201cfirst\ncase in the world to hold directors of\na corporation directly accountable for\nclimate risk,\u201d according to organisers \u2013\nand was dismissed by the High Court\nbecause\u201cdutiescannotbeenforcedunless\ndirectors personally benefit from their\nbreach\u201d.

For Alexandra, an\nimportantpartofexhibitingistoharness\nthe distinct opportunities an exhibition\npresents: three-dimensional space,\nencountering real objects, interactivity\nand play, and emotional experiences.\n\u201cA classic criticism of exhibitions from\nmuseum people tends to be like, \u2018oh, it\u2019s\njust a book on the wall,\u2019 which means\nyou\u2019ve just essentially written a story\u2014\nyou might have illustrated it with some\nthings, but it\u2019s not really achieving its\npotential.\u201d\nThe Grand Orrery\nAs a curator, one way Alexandra\napproaches this challenge is by tapping\ninto all the opportunities an object\npresents: not just the information it\nholds but its aesthetic and emotional\nqualities as well.\nShe gives the example of the grand\norrery, a 1700s planetary model in\nan exhibition she curated: \"[it\u2019s] just\nbeautiful and it\u2019s got loads of brass and\ngoldandshinystuffonit,anditjustkind\nof draws you in\u2026 And it\u2019s like, how can\nwe make more opportunities like that?\u201d\nInjecting Hope\nAlexandraalsotalksabouttheScience\nMuseum\u2019s intent to include the stories\nof their public audiences.

But\nthere\u2019s also quite a lot of ephemera and\nthings like that as well; things trying to\ncapture the more public, social aspects\nof the pandemic, like the greeting cards\nthat were made for people when they\nwere having birthdays in lockdown.\u201d\n\u201cTraditionally, very early on in its\nhistory, the Science Museum was very\nmuch about \u2018this is the work that\nscientists are doing\u2019, and it was quite an\nelite set of stories, but now we have this\nmuch more generous approach to the\nimportance and significance of science\nin our lives\u2014 and as such, it\u2019s really\nimportant to look at a broader set of\nvoices.\u201d\nFuture Exhibit on Oceans\nFinally, if there\u2019s anything that\nAlexandra could make an exhibition\nabout, what would it be?

However,\nBamille Coutrolle, the Union President-elect, in a\nstatement to Catnip this week aimed to dispel worries,\ntelling Catnip reporter Feb Senton that her background\nas \u201c Trip Secretary of IC Snowsports, President of IC\nNetball and member of IC Women\u2019s Rugby\u201d gave her\nplenty of relevant knowledge and abilities, suitable for\nher upcoming position.\nCoutrolle said \u201cMy previous roles will inform my\nPresidency and provide a strong base from which\nto spring off\u201d. She also assures students that her\nexperience playing rudgy means that she will be ready\nto tackle any issue.\nIn fact, Union staff have been overwhelmed by the\nenergy of Coutrolle\u2019s transition team who have been\nbombarding full time staff with requests so that they\ncan \u201chit the ground sliding\u201d when her term begins.\nEnquiries have ranged from the practical (\u201cWill\nthe President\u2019s office have a squat rack?\u201d) to the\nphilosphical (\u201cHow fast can the institution of the Union\ndown a pint?\u201d).\nCoutrolle has criticised some of her predecessors\nhowever saying that the Union needs to execute a\n\u201cpivot\u201d as \u201cthe way forward is currently blocked\u201d and\n\u201cnew avenues of attack need to be found\u201d. She was\nhappy to demonstrate this to the assembled reporters,\nrotating rapidly on one leg. She was less happy to\nexplain whether a subsequent second pivot would\nsimple put the Union back where it started again.\nThe nature of this pivot has started to take shape\nafter an email told staff and new officer trustees that\nthey will have to wear bibs with their positions clearly listed on the\nfront and back. Not only is this intended to facilitate introductions and\ncamaraderie but it will also make it clear when employees are away\nfrom their desks and not \u2018in the right area\u2019 and can be encouraged to\nget back to work, a key part of Coutrolle\u2019s efficiency drive.\nCoutrolle\u2019s opponent graciously conceded on the night, in a move that\ncommentators said would strengthen the democratic culture in the\nUnion. He told reporters \u201cMy opponent has shown that she can organise\na piss up in a ski resort and the voters clearly responded to that\u201d.\nCoutrolle\u2019s new colleagues have also shown their support for her\nvigourous style. New DPE Yang Yi has said that Coutrolle\u2019s us-and-them attitude learned on the sports field has been an inspiration to her\nand that she intends to be a powerful advocate for the students that\nvoted for her.\nYi, who has also recieved criticism for the limited experience she\nwas bringing to the role, has not responded to multiple requests for\ncomment.\nWe here at Catnip wish her luck in her plan to review every single\nundergraduate and postgraduate syllabus.\nWisabella Iard\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cWe do not normally notice the air we breathe.\nSimilarly,we[\u2026]havenotnoticedtheclimateoftrust\nthat is required to support much of our knowledge.\u201d\n- John Hardwig\nAn analogy that can be used to describe the\nambition of Martin Mikael Lilius in writing\nTrust, Knowledge and Society is trying to explain the\nconceptofairtoanunaware,unassumingstranger.Airis\nessential. It\u2019s ubiquitous. But to the stranger it might\nseem strange that someone has approached them to\ndiscuss something they already have a subconscious\nappreciation of. They are breathing, after all. That is\nwhat it feels like for Lilius to dedicate an entire piece\nof work to a single moral concept, trust. He takes us\nthrough how it interweaves with everyday society\nand how it all affects us, enabling us to live with our-selves, others, and the planet. Trifectas, like the one just\nused, both make and guide how Trust elaborates its\ngrand ideas to the reader. The book is divided into the\nrelationship between trust and \u2018The Individual\u2019, what\nwe know (\u2018Knowledge\u2019), and \u2018Society\u2019.\nIn \u2018The Individual\u2019, trust is first portrayed as a means\nto understand who we are, and why we are who we\nare. Here, the reader is allowed to become familiar\nwith how Lilius gets his point across. In what might\nappear to be a dry approach to creating a narrative\nin non-fiction, Lilius insists that simply and directly\nreframingexistingmodelsofknowledgewithinthelens\noftrustwillservetoopentheeyes\nof the reader to its importance. It\nis with this systematic approach\nthat he somewhat repurposes\npsychological concepts like\nattachment theory into deft new\ninstruments for dissecting our\nviews of love and the relationships we have.\nAs a result, it is quite enjoyable to read Trust as it becomes an\nexcellently condensed story of our existence. In\n\u2018Knowledge\u2019, Lilius uses events\nranging from the US elections to the advent of Darwinism to explore the sources of\ninformation we trust, and the\nreasons for trusting them. And in\n\u2018Society\u2019, Lilius heavily\nfocuses on the economic\nrelevance of trust and how it\nshapes the financial world as we\nsee it.\nLimits naturally appear for the ways in which\ntrust can be turned into a\nprogenitor for problems or\nconcepts of life, but the book\nlends itself to offering insights\nwith the potential to change\nyour perspective; depending\non the attitude you approach it\nwith. So, while certain sections\nmight seem less appealing upon an initial read, the\ncomprehensive nature with which Lilius tackles his\ntopics, leaving much room for self-reflection, means\nthat it is almost certain that different sections will have\ntheir time in the limelight, though not necessarily all at\nonce. I found myself, for example, resonating with the\nsections on how we assess people as trustworthy and\nfelt a younger version of myself more engaged with\nLilius\u2019 psychotherapeutic analysis of trust.\nThere is an inherent irony in writing a book about\ntrust; in having the need for trust between reader\nand writer. That irony extends to this review too: do\nyou as a reader trust that I have read and finished the\nbook and am offering my honest opinion? However,\nreturning to the analogy of comparing the written\nefforts within Trust, Knowledge, and Society to\nexplaining air to a stranger (something Lilius\u2019\nreferences himself), there is an element that such a\nhyper-aware focus on trust may serve no purpose in\nplace of our intuition in our inherent perception of\nhow the world works. We do not necessarily stress over\nthe trustworthiness of what may be deemed minutiae\nin everyday living. But in this age of bias, where it is\never more important to assess who and what we listen,\nMartin Mikael Lilius crafts a necessary impersonal\nlook into a quality that, when compromised, has grave\nconsequences for everyone, and for our planet. This\nis likely why Lilius quotes Shakespeare in the book -love all, trust a few, do wrong to none - as so much can\nhinge on the \u2018few\u2019 we trust. Or as he begins: \u2018trust [is]\nthat lubricant of life everyone instinctively recognises\nas essential\u2019.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n20\nI trust you\u2019ll read this, right?\nBook Review\nFiyinfoluwa Timothy Oladipo Books Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nBOOKS\nREVIEW BOOKS AVAILABLE!\nIf you love reading but don\u2019t know which books\nto write about, we have a number of titles that\nneed reviewing - these are usually recent or upcoming releases, hot off the press.\nCrime/Thriller\nIn The Shadow They Cast by Paul Graham\nRed Light and Bell by Richard Cobourne\nLanguages\nThe Anglo-French Exchange (Textbook) by Dr.\nAllswell E.

It\u2019s the last\nnight of Musical Theatre Society\u2019s (MTSoc\u2019s) production of\nThe Addams Family, directed by\nNathalie Tedfors Lindell with\nMiguel Mestre assistant direct-ing, and produced by Sam Lee.\nBy the time you read this, the\nfour performances (on the 8th\n, 9th\n,\n10th\n, and 11th\nof March) will all be\nover, but I have tried to capture\nthe brilliant dichotomy, all-per-vading talent, and gorgeous satirical inversion that came together\nto form MT\u2019s version of Addams.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t\nknow the plot, it involves two\nfamilies, the \u2018normal\u2019 Beineke family, and the Addams.\nMembers of the latter dream of visiting the sewers of\nParis, enjoy being tortured by a sibling, collect instru-mentsoftorturepersuasion,fallinlovewiththeMoon,\nand squish songbirds to death with their bare hands.\nThe play opens with the revealing of an unlikely and subversive love story between the Addams\u2019s\nonly daughter, Wednesday (Dana Whigan) and the\nBeineke\u2019s son, Lucas (Jack Finnis). They\u2019ve decided to\nget married, but Wednesday can\u2019t quite bring herself to\ntell her mother, Morticia (Solen Marqueste).\nThe keeping of this\nsecret comes between\nMorticia and her hus-band, Gomez (Magdy\nMekdad) and sends\nWednesday\u2019s broth-er, Pugsley (Aanaya\nMiah), into a crisis.\nInspired by his niece\u2019s\nengagement, Wednesday\u2019s uncle, Fester (Is-abela Lopez Ticianelli), leads the ghosts of\npast Addams during\nthe rest of the play in a\nmission to ensure Lucas and Wednesday\u2019s\nlove story is a success.\nNo one\u2019s really sure whose grandmother (Molly Clifford) is living in the attic of the Addams mansion but\nit\u2019s clear that Lucas\u2019 dad, Mal Beineke (Alfie Grimshaw), has become an \u201cunfeeling, rigid, selfish control\nfreak\u201d and his wife, Alice (Cecilia Longoni) is secretly wishing for the passion that used to exist between\nthem. All of this is punctuated by the perfectly enunciated grunting of the Addams\u2019 butler, Lurch (George\nChipperfield).

Readers may\nhave noticed that Felix very rarely features instances\nof Imperial teams losing the game. This is not because\nImperial rarely lose (believe me, having monitored\nBUCS and LUSL scores weekly, this is far from true)\nbut because, often only victorious teams want to send\nme content. In fact, several teams have even pulled out\nof sending reports after faring worse in games than they\nanticipated (you know who you are). So it is a relief to\nme that, however the games go, at the Imperial Varsity,\nan Imperial victory is guaranteed.\nIC win 27-12 at the Imperial Varsity\nAnother annual devastating defeat in Waterpolo\nAnother year, another Varsity, and another great\nwin for Imperial College Swim and Water Polo\n(ICSWP). Varsity is one of the most hotly anticipated\nmeetups of the year for ICSWP and their Medic coun-terparts, ICSMWP, and this year was no different. In\nan Ethos filled to capacity with eager spectators, the\nrivalry between IC and ICSM reached levels higher\nthan the pre-covid era. Indeed, throughout the season,\nboth teams have shared players for national and regional competitions, leading the Medics to gain 1st place in\nLondon league, while IC qualified to the final of the\nLUSL cup (to be played this Friday). So, it was with\ngreatanticipationthatbothsidesassembledthemselves\nat Ethos on 17th March.\nIn a twist with respect to the latest years, this year\na grand total of three games were played, with an outstanding performance from all the six teams participat-ing.\nAfter Sean\u2019s excellent goal in the first quarter, it was\nquickly clear to that this year would be just\nlike every other year: incredibly painful and downright\ndepressing for the Medics. With IC 2s captain Nic\nleading the charge, the result was never really in doubt.\nDespite a brief flicker of hope in the second quarter\nwhen the Medics managed to get ahead by one goal,\nIC buckled down during the third and fourth quarters,\nwhenMedicenthusiasmandaggressiongavewaytoour\ndiscipline in defence (partially thanks to the screams\nand compulsive hand-waving of the acting-coach Betsy) and ruthless efficiency in attack. IC won the tough\nbut exciting game 5-7.\nNext up were the Women\u2019s 1s, led by the immense\nPhilo. After a one-year hiatus, IC girls were back in\naction and in incredible form, playing harder, faster\nand stronger than the Medics could handle. This game\ndidn\u2019t even give them an opportunity to equalise, as\ngoal after goal was scored in an impressive demonstration of precision and power from IC. The girls also\ndemonstrated some excellent defensive plays, forcing\nthe Medics to always be on the back foot when in IC\u2019s\nside of the pool, struggling just to get a ball on target,\nlet alone score against one\nof the best goalkeepers in\nthe league, Megan. Even\nwhen given the opportunity to take penalties, Megan\nacted as a literal wall, saving three of the Medics\u2019 attempts and ruining many a\nMedic\u2019s hopes and dreams.\nIC star player Matilda left\nthe Medics clueless during\ncounters, often leading the\ncharge with some excellent\none-on-ones which the\nMedics could do little but\nwatch, their nearest defensive player still trying to catch up. The\nfinal score of\n6-1 to IC really\nreflects just how\nlittle chance the\nMedics had.\nThe final\ngame was between the Men\u2019s\n1s. Despite IC\u2019s\ncoach shamelessly playing for\nthe Medics, nothing could stop the\ninevitable. With\na long bench that\nwouldkeeptheboys\nfresh and well-rest-ed, ICSWP played\nsome excellent polo.\nIC\u2019s centre-forwardand upcoming BUCS captain\nPatrick quickly became the top scorer from his posi-tion, thanks to his pluriannual experience in the field.\nThe four captains, Jahan, Angelo, Lorenzo and Tom\ncoordinated the team\u2019s effort, both from the side and\nin the pool. As centre-back, Lorenzo acted like a fortress that no Medic could even attempt to assail. Jahan\nplayedexcellentlyinallpositions,withhisspeedonthe\nwing, and playing just as effectively when acting as cen-tre-back. Jackie and Betsy gave ICSWP some of their\nstrongest performances this season, leading to many\nof the Medics arguing about who would mark them,\nand even more requesting to swap out after just a few\nminutes of their fury. Finally, Tom performed with his\nusual flair, taking shots from 5 to 6 metres that effortlessly and consistently found the back of the net.

Imperial Medics defied all expectations with their outstanding run to\nthe final.

The (basically) freshers\nMihir and Tvishi had a tougher time, especially from Medics Andy and Sophie\nwho played brilliantly, but managed\nto pull through and win three matches despite Tvishi being headshotted.\nThe Medics won their first match with\nAndy and Sophie beating Tom and\nFuyue in two sets, a surprise victory\nbut well deserved for the resilient med-ics. Tom and Fuyue bounced back to\ncrushingly win their next two matches.\nWith that, the win was sealed: Imperial Mixed 1s won 8-1 and were\ncrowned LUSL cup champions after\nnine-odd years!

If you didn\u2019t see the pullout, we actually\nmanaged a 100% success rate for all of our predictions.\nIf you did see it then, for the record, all of those predictions were Mike\u2019s.\nEverything Everywhere was certainly the star of the\nshow this year, taking home a total of seven awards: the\nillustrious Best Picture, Best Actress (Michelle Yeoh),\nBest Director (the Daniels), Best Supporting Actor\n(Ke Huy Quan), and Best Original Screenplay. It also\nset its fair share of records, with Michelle Yeoh being\nonly the second woman of colour to win in the leading actress category, and according to The Guardian it\u2019s\nthe first time multiple Asian actors won in a single year.\nEven for the most verdant Hollywood haters among\nyou (and you would not be blamed for that opinion),\nthat\u2019s certainly something to celebrate. Or, depending\non how you look at it, the fact that it took so long is\nsomething to be depressed about.\nAll Quiet was the other top scoring feature this year,\ntaking home four awards: Best International Feature\nFilm, Best Original Score, Production Design, and\nCinematography. It\u2019s a rare thing for an \u2018international\u2019 film to do so well, and one produced by Netflix at\nthat, which might speak to the potential of streaming\nservices to promote foreign language films that might\notherwise be ignored by anglophone audiences.\nThe award for Best Actor went\nto a tearful Brendan Fraser, who,\ninastoryalmostparalleltothatof\nKeHuyQuan,expressedhisgratitude at being given such a creative\nopportunity after so many years of\nbeing shunned by the industry.\nPredictably, the night was not\nshort of references to the infamous\nslapping of yesteryear, but in the end it\nturned out to be thoroughly mundane \u2013\nas far as physical violence is concerned.\nHowever, the Felix Film bingo card actually was quite successful; hopefully some\nof you used it, and took as much delight\nas I did at actually getting a (tentative)\nbingo from our terrible jokes.\nUntil next year!\nA brief recap of the events of this year\u2019s Academy Awards.\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n32 film.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nFILM & TV\nScan me to read Ioana\nEsanu\u2019s review of EEAAO!\nCredit: Getty Images\nSPOT THE\nOSCARS\nHow many can you find?\nLet us know!\n\n"

We were\nlooking forward to the sandwiches and\npastries, hoping to exchange some like\nPok\u00e9mon cards on the playground. But\nwe were not the only ones there. We ran\ninto our classmate, who had the same\nhungry eyes as us.\nWe removed our gloves, unlocked\nour phones, turned them towards\nthe barista, and swiped the \u201cConfirm\nCollection\u201d lock to ensure we were not\nfrauds picking up an order we had not\npaid for in advance. Before we left, we\ntook a small sneak peek \u2014 two pastries,\none sandwich, and one mystery item\nenclosed in a paper box and sealed with\na plastic sticker. We had no idea what\nit could have been, but we trusted the\nteam at Ole & Steen to spoil us with\nsomething good. And we were right, as\nthe apple pie inside the white box was\nnot too sweet \u2014 the perfect light dessert.\nIf you have not heard about\nTooGoodToGo yet; it is an app that\nallowsfoodbusinessessuchasStarbucks,\nWasabi, and Leon to sell goodie bags\nwith unknown contents at the end of\ntheir day for a\nfraction of the\noriginal cost.\nCustomers are\nrequired to pay\nin advance, pick\nup the items\nt h e m s e l v e s\nwithin a set time\nframe (usually\n15-60 minutes),\nand are allowed\nto give a review.\nAn initial \u00a315\nordermaybesold\nfor \u00a33-\u00a37. I am\nparticularly fond\nof Roll Baby\nRoll, as they sell\nfour rolls at an\ninitial price of\n\u00a33-4 each for\n\u00a34. So you save\nabout \u00a312.\nOn the app, you can set your time\npreferences (morning, noon, afternoon,\nevening, night), your dietary preferences\n(vegan, vegetarian, or none), and your\nmeal preference (meals, baked goods,\ngroceries, and others). Furthermore, a\nmap shows you which businesses are\nclose to you and you can set the area of\nyour location from 1 mile to 30 miles.\nPayment is all cardless, and the rest is\nvery intuitive.\nThe goal was to reduce food waste\nby selling food that could not be sold\nthe next day\nfor a cheap\nprice. The\nstores set\nthe time\nf r a m e\nwhen you\ncan pick\nup the\nfood and\nhow many\npeople can\nreserve a bag.\nPopular spots\nsuch as the Japanese\nPatisserie \u201cSakurado\u201d\non Gloucester Road\nsell quickly, as only three\nto four bags may be sold daily \u2014\nsometimes none.\nOne night, as I was calling my\nboyfriend who lives in the Netherlands,\nI mentioned how I had discovered this\napp and was using it to buy pastries and\nleftoverfood.Italkedaboutitfrequently\nfor the following week, amazed by the\namount I got even though I had no\ncontrol over the amount or quality of\nfood.\nA month or so afterwards, at the usual\nevening call with him, he goes \u201cHey\nCharlie, have you ever heard of this app\nTooGoodToGo? It allows you to buy\nfood from businesses for less than half\nthe price. It\u2019s so cool, I got two meals for\nonly \u20ac4\u201d. I face-palmed myself, as you\nmay have done as well.\nWhy did I tell this story? Well,\nTooGoodToGo is also available in 16\nother countries including Canada,\nthe US, Switzerland, Germany, the\nNetherlands, Spain, and Italy. From\n2018-2022, the app grew to 9.5 million\napp installs, with 154,000 businesses\nsigned up on the application.\nIt is an exceptional method to\nreduce food waste and lead a more\nsustainable lifestyle. 320 million meals\nare thrown away each year by restaurants\nin the UK. 34% of the food waste is\ncustomer leftovers, 21% is spoiled\nfood and a whopping 45% is due to\nover-preparation. It\u2019s embarrassing for\na restaurant to admit they no longer\nhave any food, so they make more than\nrequired. This is where TooGoodToGo\ncomes in, helping businesses sell tasty\nunsold food unless the employees can\ntake it home.\nFrom a personal experience,\nTooGoodToGo has an abundance of\npastries, bread, croissants, and other\nbaked goods to offer. They are incredibly\neasy to make and don\u2019t cost much.\nThere are fewer quality restaurant offers,\nbut you learn which ones you like and\ndislike quickly. I would stay away from\nchain restaurants, as the food is most\nlikely the stuff that nobody picks \u2014such\nas Starbucks\u00b4 sliced cheese between\ntwo pieces of untoasted white bread.\nThe vegetarian options are limited,\nas restaurants cannot always promise\nvegetarian food.

Do you\nwalk to campus, attend lectures, eat\nfood with friends? Perhaps you make\nart in the evening, spend time at the\npub, or are working on a start-up. The\nchoice is yours; you have the freedom to\nchoose whether or not to do any of those\nactivities.\nHowever, Zakia does not have that\nchoice. She finished high school as\nthe top student in her class for the\nfifth year in a row, and was accepted\nto Kabul University. Zakia wanted to\nstudy computer science to develop AI\nsolutions for healthcare and was excited\nbytheopportunitytodoso.Butshelives\nin Afghanistan, and with the Taliban\u2019s\nban on education for women, she is no\nlonger allowed to attend university.\nMoreover, she cannot leave her house\nwithout accompaniement, and is\nforbidden from doing nearly everything\nshe cares about.\nAfghanistan is the only country in\nthe world to have banned women and\ngirls\u2019 education. More than half of the\npopulation are now homebound and\nunable to access schools and universities,\na privilege that we take for granted.\nFormer school sites and accommodation\nfor women\u2019s universities are now used as\nmilitary spaces, transforming areas once\ndedicated to personal and professional\ngrowth into its antithesis.

The same is\ntrue for the doctor who comes weekly to\ncheck their vitals and sometimes pushes\na sharp needle into their shoulder \u2013 the\nsecond prisoner really doesn\u2019t like him!\nAll they\u2019ve ever known of the outside\nworld are these moving shadows.\nOne day, the chains on the third\nprisoner come loose and he\u2019s able to\nwalk out. For the first time, he sees the\nbeautiful birds singing in the trees,\nbreathes in fresh smokeless air and, the\nbest part, feels the warmth of the sun\non his face. It dawns on him that there\u2019s\na whole world outside the small firelit\ncave and now, finally, he\u2019s seeing life in\nfull colour. So naturally, he runs back\nshouting with joy and explains to his\ntwo friends that the shadows aren\u2019t real;\nthere\u2019smoretolifethanLucywhobrings\nthe breakfast every morning and Johnny\nwho checks on them once weekly.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gone mad!\u201d they reply. \u201cLeave us\nalone, we\u2019re cared for and, besides, we\u2019re\nhappy here.\u201d\nThis story is an allegory from Plato\u2019s\nRepublic titled \u2018The Cave\u2019, which was\nwritten in the 4th\ncentury BC. And I\u2019m\npresenting this as my response to the\ncomment article in the last issue of Felix,\n\u201cOnReligionandMeaning\u201d.Ican\u2019tspeak\non behalf of all Christians but I suspect\nmost would relate to the experience of\nthe third prisoner to some degree. I\u2019ll\ncome back to this in a moment.\nTo take a quick detour, a common\nmisconception of Christians, one that\nI read in the aforementioned comment\npiece, is that we, in Canavan\u2019s words,\n\u201cbelieve that being religious is required\nto be \u2018good\u2019 \u2026 (and) it is entirely\npossible to be a good person while being\nnon-religious\u201d. Our leader and our God,\nJesus of Nazareth, said 2000 years ago\n\u201cIt is not the healthy who need a doctor\nbut the sick\u2026 I have not come for good\npeople,butforthebad.\u201dSoasChristians,\nwe do not think of ourselves better than\nanyone else, but, conversely, that we\nneed help. This is why we turn to Jesus.\nOn the topic of morality, Canavan\nquite rightly ended his article with this:\n\u2018We are capable of many things both\ngood and bad, so let\u2019s choose to do good\nwhere we can, when we can.\u2019 Yet from a\nphilosophical point of view, the abstract\nconcept of good and bad are just that:\nabstracts. One man\u2019s good is another\nman\u2019s bad; one woman champions pro-choice, another pro-life; one nation\nendorses the slave trade, another fights\nfor emancipation. As Christians, we\ncannot rely on ourselves to know what\nis good and bad because, in Jesus\u2019 words,\nour soul is \u201csick\u201d not \u201chealthy\u201d, as is our\nconscience. So, dogmatic though it may\nseemtoothers,wedobelieveinobjective\ntruth and morality because God made\nus to live a certain way. He sets moral\nboundaries for us, His children, for our\nown good as any loving father would.\nComing back to Plato\u2019s analogy.\nI would suppose that the first and\nsecond prisoners found some degree of\nsatisfaction and meaning in that cave;\nafter all, they knew nothing else. But\nhow much greater and more fulfilling do\nyou reckon the third prisoner\u2019s new life\nin the real world would be? Jesus calls\nthis the \u201crebirth\u201d. In essence, Christians\nare born twice: first, by our mother into\na life we think is satisfying enough even\nwith its ups and downs (the cave), but\nthen at some point we are \u2018born again\u2019\nand set free, like the third prisoner, and\nwe see life in full colour (the outside).\nIn part, that\u2019s the invitation Jesus offers\nto us all regardless of our background;\nHe tells us \u201cCome to me all you who are\ntired and burdened, and I will give you\nrest. Take my yoke upon you and learn\nfrom me, for I am gentle and humble\nof heart, and you will find rest for your\nsouls. For my yoke is easy and my burden\nis light.\u201d\nWe\u2019d love to have you at a Christian\nUnion event if you\u2019d like to know more.\nThe meaning of religion\nJorge de Andres Comment Writer\nComment\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons, Dr. Ond\u0159ej Havelka\nEdited by: Elif Civelekoglu\nIn this response to Joseph Canavan\u2019s article \u2018On religion and meaning\u2019, Jorge de Andres demonstrates the Christian point of view\nwhen it comes to the meaning and significance of religion in believers\u2019 lives.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n12 comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nCOMMENT\nJorge de Andres disputes Joseph Canavan\u2019s article through his own understanding of Christianity.\nWE CANNOT RELY\nON OURSELVES TO\nKNOW WHAT IS\nGOOD AND BAD\n\u201c\n\n"
