Two were arrested over\n\u2018imminent breach of the peace\u2019, while\nanother was arrested on suspicion\nof violent disorder during previous\nprotests.\nThe arrests were not representative\nof the protest as a whole, however.\nOne protestor was Navid Nabijou, an\nImperial student, who told Felix that\n\u201cthe level of support we received from\nbystanders was incredible. It was a\nbittersweet reminder that we live in\na city which forcefully rejected the\nTories at the election.\u201d\nLabour hold 45 of the\nParliamentary seats in London, with\nthe Conservatives on 27 and the\nLiberal Democracts on 1.\nNabijou describes the protest\u2019s\n\u201cpalpable sense of anger and\ninjustice\u2026 but also a feeling of hope,\na determination not to sink into\ndespair.\n\u201cTowards the end of the march a\nstreet party atmosphere developed,\nwith \u2018Dancing Queen\u2019 playing on\nloudspeaker[s] and multi-coloured\nballoons floating above the crowd.\u201d\nThe protests quickly took\nto Twitter, with the hashtag\n#FucktheTories the first to surface,\nwith #antiausterity soon following.\nMost participants used the platform\nto post updates on the status of the\nprotests, with one noting that they\nwere \u201cnow outside Downing St having\na dance. Choice of music: ABBA.\n#FucktheTories\u201d\nThere was also debate on Twitter\nover how people felt about the\nprotests, with opinion proving\ndivided.\nOne Twitter commentator\nremarked, \u201clast time the braying mob\ntried to subvert democracy, Thatcher\ncrushed them. Democracy will always\nwin against #antiausterity thuggery,\u201d\nwhile another tweeted that \u201cLabour\nshould be backing the #antiausterity\nprotest in London. As a party we need\nto return to the left and represent\nworking class people.\u201d\nSeveral tweets also referred to the\ngroup of protestors who encountered\nUKIP MP Douglas Carswell outside\nSt James\u2019 Park. The crowd jeered\nand swarmed Mr Carswell, shouting\n\u201cracist, racist.\u201d The police soon\nintervened, escorting him to a police\nvan to allow him to escape.\nSaid one Twitter commentator:\n\u201cProtestors have found UKIP MP\nDouglas Carswell and they\u2019re not\nhappy with him #FucktheTories.\u201d\nThe People\u2019s Assembly have\nconfirmed they are planning further\nprotests, scheduled to take place on\nthe 20th\nJune.\nDouglas Carswell MP said that he \u201cfeared the demonstrators\u201d. Photo: Huffington Post\nJack Steadman reports on the march that took place at\nthe same time as the Queen\u2019s Speech\nThoughts of a\nprotestor\nWe assembled at around five\no\u2019clock outside Downing Street,\nand began to march.For three\nhours we marched,and though\nphysically exhausted by the end\nof it,our high spirits kept us\ngoing.\nThe level of support we received\nfrom bystanders was incredible.\nIt was a bittersweet reminder\nthat we live in a city which\nforcefully rejected the Tories at\nthe election.\nThere was a palpable sense of\nanger and injustice,with loud\nchanting along the whole route.\nAt one point we assembled in\nTrafalgar Square and people\nwere invited to share their own\nexperiences of austerity.\nBut beyond this there was also a\nfeeling of hope,a determination\nnot to sink into despair.Towards\nthe end of the march a street\nparty atmosphere developed,\nwith\u201cDancing Queen\u201dplaying on\nloudspeaker and multi-coloured\nballoons floating above the\ncrowd.\nThe vast majority of economists\nnow agree that reducing\nspending in a time of crisis\nonly serves to depress growth\nand stifle the recovery.The\nexperience of various post-crisis\neconomies now provides ample\nevidence for this,and it goes\nsome way to explaining why the\nGovernment hasn\u2019t even come\nclose to meeting the deficit\nreduction targets it set in 2010.\nIn reality,these cuts are\nideological.Cameron and his\ninner circle have more or less\nadmitted this,repeatedly stating\nover the last couple of years that\neven when they reach a budget\nsurplus they will not be reversing\ntheir cuts to public services.\nThey want to take us back to a\nlevel of spending not seen for\nalmost a century.All of this is\npassed off as\u201ccommon sense\u201d\nor\u201ctough choices\u201d,when really\nit is about nothing more than\nshifting wealth from the poorest\nin society to the richest.\nProtest can make a difference.\nIn 1990,the movement of mass\nprotest and civil disobedience\nagainst the Poll Tax led to the\ncharge being repealed and\nMargaret Thatcher\u2019s resignation\nas Prime Minister.\nOn the 20th\nJune tens of\nthousands will join forces in\nthe heart of London to send a\nmessage: we will not put up with\nthese lies any longer.I hope to\nsee you there.\nNAVID NABIJOU\n\"The crowd\njeered and\nswarmed\nMr\nCarswell,\nshouting\n\u201cracist,\nracist\u201d\"\n\"The...\nPeople\u2019s\nAssembly\nclaimed\n2000... were\npresent\"\n\n"

The survey,\nput together by the Imperial College\nUnion campaign Mentality, has given\nstudents an opportunity to voice their\nexperiences with stress and mental\nhealth, and although the results are\nshocking, they are not surprising.\nMental health is important. Talking\nabout mental health is important,\nand sharing advice and support about\nmental health is also important. The\nmentality campaign has done a great\njob of raising awareness and opening\na dialogue about mental health, and\nthey have made a great number of\nrecommendations for the treatment\nand support for students who suffer\nfrom mental health conditions too.\nAlthough some may be easier to\nimplement than others, all are worth\ndoing if they make just one student\nmore capable of getting to the end\nof their degree and leaving with a\nqualification they deserve.\nWhen it comes to managing\nstudent stress though, it is unclear as\nto why some of the more simplistic\nmechanisms that could alleviate a lot\nof the pressure have not been put in\nplace before.\nStress and mental wellbeing are\ntwo ends of the same spectrum,\nand although we can never say\ndefinitively that too much stress can\nlead to anxiety, depression, insomnia\netc, I have definitely seen friends and\npeers pushed to the limit with work\nload and revision and starting to\nexhibit symptoms that were a cause\nfor concern.\nStudents at Imperial are clever,\nhard-working individuals; they\nwouldn\u2019t have made it past the first\nweek of term if they weren\u2019t. We are\nstudents that thrive in competition\nand relish in success; great traits for\nthe working world, but potentially\nharmful in large quantities when still\ntrying to balance student life with all\nthe other pressures of being a young\nadult.\nImperial can often harbour a\nrather intensive work environment,\nwith many students all too familiar\nwith working all-nighters, balancing\nmultiple deadlines, struggling to\nfind the hours in the day to complete\ncoursework and burning out before\nexams.\nThe survey found that 39% of\nstudents suffer from mental stresses.\nSome stress is good for students; it\ndrives them to finish lab reports,\nrevise for exams and keeps them on\ntheir toes. It is only when this stress\nstarts to hinder a student\u2019s ability to\nfocus on other essential areas of life\ndoes this stress becomes damaging,\nand may be one of the factors that\nhas driven the student satisfaction at\nImperial so low in previous years.\nStudents time and time again\ncomplain to their department\nrepresentatives and the Union\nabout mounting deadlines, clashing\ncoursework submissions and other\nfactors of their degrees that add to\nthis stress, and it is the sort of stress\nthat can push students over the edge,\nwhatever the edge may be for certain\npeople.\nI remember a particularly\nharrowing all-nighter spent in the\nlibrary as my classmates and I battled\nto complete seven lab reports all due\nin for the following day; most of them\nmanaged, but I remember one just\npassing out and going home soon\nafter.\nThe stress of those deadlines and\nthe fallout from missing them could\nhave been avoided if scheduling had\nbeen done more conscientiously,\nand it is little things like this that\ncan make the life of a student more\npleasant.\nImperial was never meant to be\neasy; knowing us, we would have left\ncomplaining about what a waste of\nmoney it was if we weren\u2019t getting\nmillions of contact hours and lab\nsessions. However there are simple\nthings that Imperial can do to\nkeep students satisfied with their\neducation and not result in 75% of\nstudents being mentally distressed in\nsome way.\nSimple things like getting\ndepartments to spend that little bit\nlonger teaching students just how\nto learn from lectures and tutorials\ninstead of throwing them in at the\ndeep end, or spacing out deadlines so\nthey don\u2019t all sit in the middle of an\nEaster holiday or at the end of a term\ncan all help students make it to the\nend of the year without burning out,\nstressing out, and even potentially\ndropping out as a result.\nPersonal tutors being trained\nin understanding the concerns of\nstudents is another key improvement\nthat would work wonders in the lives\nof many nervous undergraduates (and\npostgraduates) could catch students\nas they fall at the first hurdle; I\nremember in my first week at\nImperial going home at the weekend\nbecause I just couldn\u2019t cope (plus I\nwas too hungover to breathe, let alone\ncook for myself).\nI was lucky to have an incredible\npersonal tutor who checked in on me\nto make sure I was ok, and made me\nfeel more comfortable in what was a\npretty stressful year all in all. Imagine\nif I hadn\u2019t come back after that first\nweekend: who would print all the\ntypos in this paper then?\nI hope College takes on board the\nrecommendations Mentality have\nmade, but doesn\u2019t overlook the simple\nthings it can do straight away to alter\nthe ethos of Imperial at departmental\nlevels and below. Having welfare\nseminars behind closed doors doesn\u2019t\nhelp anyone.\nTake a leaf out of Mentality\u2019s book\nand get people talking: arrange for\ntutors, lecturers and course convenors\nto talk to each other, to share best\npractice and making things easier for\nstudents as soon as they walk into the\nlecture theatre. You might find that\nother, bigger concerns might improve\nas a result too.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S EDITORIAL\nImperial can do more\nto help us stress less\nContents\nNews\b3-10\nPolitics\b12\nWelfare 13-14\nMusic 15-16\nGames\b17\nTravel\b18\nArts\b23-25\nFilm\b26-27\nTelevision\b28\nHangman 29-32\nPuzzles\b33-35\nC and S 36-37\nSport 40\nFelix Offices\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nPrinted by Iliffe Print Cambridge, Winship\nRoad, Cambridge.\nRegistered newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix\nFront page picture: John-Paul Jones\nTop banner: Facebook\n\n"

As you fight you rank up\nallowing you to form a squad, buy\nbetter weapons and influence more\nof the battle with radio calls. These\nbattles happen on about a dozen\nmaps, which all a very distinctive\nfeel to them. In terms of gameplay\nthe game does what it says on the\ntin, consisting of you looking down\nat your little guy and controlling\nhim using WASD and your mouse.\nYou have unlimited ammo, but do\nstill need to reload once your clip is\nempty. There are quite a few different\nweapons as well as gimmicks like a\nriot shield, that all have a distinctive\nfeel about them and allow you to\nswitch up your style according to\nhow you want to play. Furthermore\nthere are several types of vehicles for\na quick transport (as well as handy\nweapon to run over enemies!)\nThe art style is really distinctive,\nnamely because of the fact that it\nis really simplistic and cartoony. It\nreally does set itself apart from other\nthings around, and definitely will\nstand the test of time. This graphical\nstyle also allows it to run comfortably\non most computers for a super\nsmooth game-play experience.\nSo now to my personal impression.\nWhen I first started the game up I\ndecided to skip the tutorial (like I\nalways do if possible) and jumped\nstraight into a single-player battle. It\ntook me a surprisingly little amount\nof time (albeit several embarrassing\ndeaths) to learn the controls and\nfinally have an impact on the battle.\nFrom the off, rather than feeling\nlike I was just in some tiny skirmish\nI actually really felt like I was in a\nbattle with hundreds of soldiers,\nbullets flying around and tanks\ncrushing hapless innocents which\nI have only really felt in one other\ngame, Planetside 2. This really drew\nme in and it was quite fascinating\nwatching the ebb and flow of the\nFelix Games is back with Max Eggl reviewing indie hit Running with Rifles\nSquad, Go Go Go!\nBack in yonder days when I\nfirst started playing computer\ngames, the one that really filled\nmy childhood after-school hours was\none called Army Men. Basically it\nwas a shooter revolving around the\ngreen plastic men, where you would\ncontrol one of them and shoot the\nother plastic dudes using a variety of\nguns, grenades and vehicles. Sadly the\ngraphics of this classic did not stand\nthe test of time, and I moved on to\nbigger and graphically better things.\nHowever, recently in a fit of nostalgia\nI decided to look this game up again,\nand while doing so came across the\ngame Running with Rifles on Steam,\nmade by indie studio Modulaatio\nGames. Described as a \u201ctactical top-down shooter with RPG elements\u201d, I\nhad found a game that looked eerily\nsimilar to my past passion nd it didn\u2019t\nlook half bad! After checking out\nsome videos, I knew I had to get it.\nFinally, the end of exams came,\nI fired up Steam for the first time\nin a long time and spent my hard-earned cash on this gem. At a measly\n\u00a311 I was well prepared to take the\nrisk that this may be a dud since\nmost good titles (and notably bad\nones) usually cost a lot more than\nthis. Furthermore in addition to\nthe relative cheapness, I was also\npleasantly surprised that this game\nalso runs on Mac OS (in addition to\nWindows and Linux, so no excuses!)\nand it seemed that nothing stood in\nthe way of me jumping straight in!\nWell, actually a alcohol fuelled night\n(which didn\u2019t end well) forced me to\npostpone the playing of this game,\nbut after overcoming my hangover\nthe next day I finally managed to take\nthis baby out for a run and I have to\nsay that I am not disappointed.\nFirstly let me give a bit of a\ndescription of what this game actually\nis. You are a soldier thrown into a\nvariety of battles who is looking to\nwin the fight for your chosen team,\nconflict. The first battle which I\nplayed (which unfortunately we\nlost) took about an hour and I was\ncompletely engrossed the entire time.\nI also loved the outbursts from the\nenemies and allies alike that went\nalong the lines of \u201cOMG Grenade!\u201d\netc. It definitely was a nice touch and\ngave me a chuckle which can never\ngo amiss! After messing about with\nthe single-player modes, including\ndifferent maps, different game modes\nand the single-player campaign I was\nreally impressed, and I will definitely\nbe spending more time in the world\nof running with rifles.\nHowever, these days only singleplayer games rarely make it far, so I\nwas keen to test out the multi-player\naspect, something I feel like this\ngame could pull of really well. This\nis the one part of the game where I\nwas not happy. Not really the fault\nof the game devs or the game itself,\nbut there weren\u2019t actually that many\npeople online to play with. This could\nhave several factors, for example\nnamely that it is predominantly\nbeing played by Americans who were\nasleep at the time I tried my luck or a\nlack of a popular interest. The server\nI did try, which had about 10 guys,\nreally was enjoyable but with the\nlack of numbers there was a need for\ncomputer guys, meaning it actually\nstill felt like a single-player map. Yet,\n\"I will\ndefinitely\nbe\nspending\nmore time\nin the\nworld of\nrunning\nwith rifles.\"\n\"After\nchecking\nout some\nvideos, I\nknew I had\nto get it.\"\nthinking about it the game just came\nout so I am not really worried about\nthis aspect and definitely hope that\nonce more people find out about\nRunning with Rifles more people\nwill play online leading to a healthy\namount of servers allowing for more\noptions.\nOne last pet peeve, which is really\nso minor I feel incredibly petty\nfor mentioning it, is the lack of\nsteam achievements! I love steam\nachievements, as they give me\nsomething to aim for in the game and\ngives them some longevity, however\nthe game devs seem super friendly\nand I think this will most likely be a\nfeature implemented in the future.\nAll in all I have to say, if you just\nfinished your exams, are currently\nrevising or alternatively have\nnothing really better to do I would\ngive this a game a definite look. For\nthe price you are getting a really fun\nand enjoyable experience that will\ndefinitely take you past the 20/30\nhour mark. Furthermore it will run\ngreat on almost anything, so you\nwon\u2019t have to upgrade your rig if its\nslightly older. Now I am off, back to\nrelive the memories of Army men\nand make some new ones in Running\nwith Rifles!\nRunning with Rifles is currently\navailable on steam for Windows, Mac\nOS X and linux for \u00a310.99.\n\n"

Full of comics, poetry and prose\nfrom fans who are also friends, \u2018Drive\nPast My House\u2019 is a snazzy addition\nto any fan\u2019s collection, and perfectly\ncomplements their dreamy, highschool rom-com aesthetic. Highlights\ncome in the form of comics from\nBabak Ganjei of Wet Paint and\nAbsentee, whose other work includes\n\u2018Clarkson Blackout\u2019 which improves\nJeremy Clarkson\u2019s autobiography\nby selectively deleting 90% of the\ntext, and John Allison, creator of\n\u2018Scary Go Round\u2019 whose illustrations\nimagine Summer Camp\u2019s writing\nprocess, involving Eric Clapton,\na time-machine and 1995. Many\ncontributors are regular \u2018zine\u2019 folk,\nbut comic novices will recognise\nEmmy The Great\u2019s name, and\nher Instagram-friendly centrefold\nis a novel take on the comic panel\nconcept. A scripted section sounds\nlike it could be a spoken word\nintroduction to their album; think\nSavages\u2019 \u2018Shut Up\u2019 or every track on\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\nInevitable comparisons of Summer\nCamp\u2019s sound to American teen\nmovies of the 90s, \u00e0 la Clueless,\nare even truer since they wrote\nand performed every song on the\nsoundtrack for \u2018Beyond Clueless\u2019,\nCharlie Lyne\u2019s documentary about\nthis art form as a better indication\nof the zeitgeist than adult movies\nof the same era. The zine certainly\nfits with this. Prose pieces describe\n\u2018Michelles\u2019, \u2018Donnys\u2019 and archetypal\nteen heartthrob Brandon Routh, of\nSuperman Returns fame. The album\nitself is full of pleasing marital\nharmonies, and whilst maintaining\nthat familiar Summer Camp sound\nthere are stand out tracks. \u2018Keep\nOut\u2019 is unlike anything we\u2019ve heard\nfrom them before. It\u2019s an aggressive,\nmarching to meet your ex tune\nand manages to feel fresh whilst\nhaving that oh so familiar chord\nprogression. Jeremy, who usually\nsticks to complimenting Elizabeth\nSankles\u2019 main harmony part, takes\ncentre-stage in \u2018You\u2019re Gone\u2019, where\nhe quietly repeats aspirational lyrics\nagainst fuzzy guitars on the most\nraucous song on the album.\nIs the zine necessary for full\nenjoyment of the album? Probably\nnot. If you\u2019re not into comics,\nillustration or particularly obsessed\nwith the band then you might not\nbother. But, if you\u2019re not particularly\nfamiliar with them, but know you\nlike their sound and vibe, it might be\nworth investing in. Your investment\nbeing \u00a33, and considering you\u2019ll likely\nas not stream the album, it might\nbe nice to have a physical object to\nassociate with them. In the way that\nmusic videos are important, from the\ndays of MTV to the present, where\nvideo-streaming counts towards chart\nposition, band released music zines\nare another way to connect to fans.\nThey\u2019re saying: we like this, visually\nthis is our vibe, and do you like it too?\nIn this way, the zine isn\u2019t necessarily\njust \u2018one for the fans\u2019.\nSummer Camp curated their own\nzine, and you very much get that\nimpression. It\u2019s personal, some of\nthe comics take the mickey out\nof themselves and in no way is it\ndecadent or self-indulgent, without\nbeing firmly tongue in cheek. Will\nzines become the done thing across\nthe board, or amongst big selling\nartists? Although interesting to\nsee what your favourite bands are\ninterested in visually, it\u2019s hard to\nimagine bigger artists curating a\nzine without being pretentious as\nSummer Camp manage. You really\nget the impression that the band\nare quite nice; there\u2019s little hint of\nself-congratulation, and it feels like\nthey made it purely for shits and gigs.\nThey are luckier in the sense that\nthey don\u2019t have to worry so much\nabout marginalising the tastes of fans;\nBeyonc\u00e9 would probably struggle to\ncurate something that would please\nthe entirety of her huge fanbase.\nUnless it was just selfies. Which I\nwould inevitably still fork out for.\nMusic zines don\u2019t begin and end\nwith artist-curated collections.\nIt would be wrong to talk about\nmusic zines without mentioning\nthe glorious \u2018Not A New Wave\u2019, a\nSleater-Kinney fanzine curated by\nOne Beat.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 23\n29.05.2015\nFELIX\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Siege: Violence in the Levant\nThe cast of The Siege, currently on at the Battersea Arts Centre Photo: The Freedom Theatre\nClara Clark Nevola checks out this Palestinian work\n\"The\nSiege is\ncompletely\nunique,\neven in\nLondon\u2019s\ntheatre\nscene\"\nApolitically engaged play in\na small theatre in South\nLondon. There have been\nmany of these and, in the glorious\ntradition of fringe theatre, there\nwill be more; but The Siege at the\nBattersea Art Centre is something\nentirely different, unique even in\nLondon\u2019s multifaceted subversive\ntheatre scene. The Siege is a\nperformance by the Freedom Theatre,\na theatre company and acting school\nbased on the West Bank, in Palestine.\nThey operate from the Jenin Refugee\ncamp, and they are on tour to the UK\nshowing their newest production, the\nstory of the siege of Bethlehem.\nBased on interviews with the real-life Palestinian fighters who were\npresent, The Siege tells the story of\nhow the Church of the Nativity in\nBethlehem, considered one of the\nholiest Christian sites, was in 2002\nsurrounded by Israeli troops for\n39 days, besieging the fighters and\nmany citizens who had taken refuge\nthere, as well as the Franciscan\nmonks who lived in the church\u2019s\nmonastery. The siege was carried out\nto capture the Palestinian militants,\nand was criticised internationally\nas a humanitarian crisis, since the\nhundreds of people within the church\nlacked food, water and sanitation for\nover a month. Some of the fighters\nand two civilians were shot during the\nsiege, picked off by waiting snipers\noutside.\nThe Siege focuses on a small handful\nof Palestinian combatants, telling\ntheir story during the entrapment.\nThe Israeli troops are represented\nonly as a constant, oppressive threat\n\u2013 the bursts of machine gun fire and\nthe megaphone messages instructing\nsurrender. The throng of civilians,\nalso invisible, is felt as a weighty\nresponsibility, for whom the fighters\nhave to provide by finding food and\nclean water. After all, as one of the\nfighters says, \u201cRevolution is like a\nfish, and the people are its water\u201d \u2013\nwithout their support, the revolution\nis in vain. The fighters talk, while\naway the time, they worry about their\nloved ones, pine for good food. Their\nhope and resistance slowly gives\nway to doubt and despair as the food\nruns short, the death toll increases,\nand the situation shows no signs of\nchanging. What can they do, alone\nand shut off from the world? Is their\nresistance in vain? Are they harming\nthe people for whose homeland they\nfight? These questions hang heavy on\nthem, and on the audience, broken by\nmoments of temporary camaraderie,\nsigning, and reveries of happier\ntimes. The first-hand account of the\nsiege is frequently interrupted by an\nimaginary flash forward, in which an\nenthusiastic tour guide (the brilliant\nAhmed Tobasi) shows tourists (the\naudience) round the Church of the\nNativity, pointing out the cultural,\nhistorical and religious sites. These\nscenes are light relief for the audience\nfrom the AK47\u2019s, shelling, and\nstarvation of the main story, but\nalso highlight the incongruity of the\nchurch\u2019s role as a battleground.\nThe Freedom Theatre\u2019s aim is to\n\u201cgenerate cultural resistance\u201d. Their\nwork has a deep community effect\nby empowering a disenfranchised\ncommunity, training women and\nyoung people as skilled actors,\nbut their message is clear: theirs\nisn\u2019t a happy-clappy alternative to\nresistance, this is a cultural, nonviolent but forceful message of\nPalestinian legitimacy and resistance\nto the Israeli \u2018occupation\u2019. Their\npresence in the UK has been opposed\nby some, and the funding awarded\nto the theatre company by the Arts\nCouncil England has been criticised\nas a \u2018pro-Palestinian\u2019 move, the\nimplication being that this play\ncondones terrorist activity against\nthe state of Israel. Knowing all this,\nI was ready for an interesting but\ntiring evening of angry propaganda.\nWhat I was wholly unprepared for\nis the artistic quality of The Siege.\nWhatever your opinions on the\nIsraeli-Palestinian situation, The\nSiege is a play worth seeing, with a\nfantastic cast, evocative staging and\na gripping and moving story to tell.\nMoments of comedy and tenderness\nalleviate a play that highlights the\nhumanity of those involved in what\nis \u2013 to us \u2013 nothing more than a\nnews flash. Of course the play is\nbiased, but it would be ridiculous to\ncriticise it for being so: it\u2019s the story of\nPalestinian fighters during the siege\nof Bethlehem, told from their point\nof view. Their fears, their hopes, their\ninsecurities, their pain. It speaks to an\ninternational audiences whose views\nhave been polarised by more than\nhalf a century of conflict.\nThe Siege doesn\u2019t enter into this\nquagmire of opposing opinions, but\npresents the views of some young\nmen who fought for their concept\nof home, family and belonging. The\ndeal which eventually ended the siege\nwas a European-brokered settlement\nby which the Israeli troops lifted the\nsiege and the Palestinian fighters\nwere exiled to Gaza or a European\ncountry where, 13 years later, they\nstill remain. The Siege leaves the\nlimbo in which they live, and the\nhome for which they fought for, as\na heavy question mark above the\naudience. Never mind the politics, the\nrights and wrongs of international\nlaw, the legitimacy of one state\nagainst another \u2013 what about the\nactual people?\nThe Siege was on at the Battersea Arts\nCentre from 19th-23rd\nMay.\n\"The home\nfor which\nthe rebels\nfought\nhangs like\na question\nmark above\nthe stage\"\nEditorial:\nThe Power of\nTheatre\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nWalter Benjamin wrote that\n\u201cmemory is not an instrument\nfor exploring the past, but its\ntheatre. It is the medium of\npast experience\u201d. While this\nmay be true, I feel that actually\nthe theatre is an instrument\nfor exploring both our memory\nand our past. The theatre\ncan transport us, to far flung\nplace, and long-dead cities; the\ntheatre can delight us, its witty\nwordplay creating sublime joy;\nand the theatre can horrify\nus, forcing us to confront all\nthat is unspeakable about our\ncollective experience.\nThis week, Felix Arts takes a\nlook at four new London theatre\nproductions, all of which \u2013 in\na myriad of ways \u2013 explore\nthe role that theatre can play\nin our lives. We start off with\nClara Clark Nevola\u2019s review of\nTheSiege, currently on at the\nBattersea Arts Centre. A piece\nby the Freedom Theatre, based\nin the West Bank, TheSiege\nreminds us all of the way culture\nand theatre has influenced and\naffected conflicts, not least in\nthe Levant.\nClara then heads over the the\nSt James Theatre, where their\nlatest production, McQueen, is\nresurrecting the past, bringing\nthe late designer back to life.\nOnly theatre has the power\nto actually bring a sense of\nphysicality to a ghost, allowing it\nto tread the boards.\nWe then check out the National\nTheatre\u2019s latest production, a\nperformance of the restoration\ncomedy TheBeaux\u2019Stratagem;\nthrough watching such theatre,\nnot only do we delight our\nsenses, but we also sharpen our\nminds on the wits of playwrights\npast, in this case Irish writer\nGeorge Farquhar.\nFinally, Jingjie Cheng is taken\nacross the globe through\nthe Ninagawa Company\u2019s\nproduction of Hamlet. Taking\nits cues from Japanese\ntraditions, Ninagawa\u2019s Hamlet\nis a perfect fusion between two\ndiametrically different cultures,\nhighlighting the similarities we\nshare as members of a common\nhumanity, and the enduring\npower both of Shakespeare\u2019s\nlanguage and that of culture as\na whole.\n\n"

Photo: Imperial College London\nKunal Wagle reports as former student\u2019s donation extends scheme\nUnion releases second impact report\nThe Chemical Engineering\ndepartment has announced\ntwo new scholarships.\nThe scholarships, which will\nprovide tuition fees, a significant\nmaintenance allowance, and a\ntravel bursary, are made possible by\na \u201cgenerous gift\u201d from Mrs Marit\nMohn, who graduated from the\ndepartment in 1973).\nThe scholarships, which are for PhD\nstudents of any nationality, form\npart of the extension of the Marit\nMohn PhD scholarship scheme. The\nscheme was started in 2011, when it\nwas established by another donation\nfrom Mrs Mohn. This is the latest\nin a string of donations made by\nMrs Mohn to support education at\nImperial College London.\nSpeaking about the new scholarship\nAndrew Livingston, head of the\ndepartment of Chemical Engineering,\nsaid \u201cHer [Marit Mohn] support for\nscholarships is offering life-changing\nopportunities for generations of\nchemical engineers.\u201d He went on\nto say that staff at the department\n\u201care hugely grateful, not just for her\nfinancial support, but also for her\ninterest in the department and its\ndevelopment.\u201d\nThe first scholar is expected to join\nthe College in October 2015, with\nthe second scholar following roughly\na year later. The extension of the\nMarit Mohn PhD scholarship scheme\nmeans that the department will now\nhave three scholarships available.\nDonor Marit Mohn said of her\ndonation, \u201cThe Department of\nChemical Engineering at Imperial\nis among the world\u2019s leaders and, as\nan alumna, I am proud to contribute\nto its further success and to give\nsomething back to the UK higher\neducation system. Excellence in\nengineering will be a key to solving\nmany of the problems the world faces\ntoday.\u201d\nProfessor Jeff Magee, who is Dean of\nthe Faculty of Engineering, was also\nin high spirits, adding \u201cPhilanthropic\nsupport for scholarships is hugely\nimportant. It gives us the flexibility\nto recruit the very best candidates\nin priority research areas, or in\nimportant fields that are relatively\nunderfunded by public money. The\nimpact of Marit Mohn\u2019s generosity\nwill be felt across the Department of\nChemical Engineering for many years\nto come.\u201d\nThis week Imperial College Union\npublished their second termly impact\nreport of this academic year.\nThe report aims to summarise\nthe big effects that Imperial College\nUnion has achieved in the past term,\nand benchmarks its progress on\nimproving the student experience,\ncommunity, and voice, as well as\nmaking sure that the Union becomes\na sustainable organisation.\nThe first section focuses on\n\u201cEnhancing the Student Experience\u201d.\nHere the report highlights Imperial\nPlus, a scheme whereby student\nrepresentatives and those involved\ncan log the hours they spend\nvolunteering to work towards a scaled\nqualification system. The number of\nstudents has doubled since last year,\nbut the number of hours logged has\nnot increased by anywhere near the\nsame margin, perhaps indicating a\nfall in enthusiasm.\nAlso commented on is Community\nConnections, described as a\n\u201cvolunteer brokerage service\u201d. The\nUnion reports an 18% increase in\norganisation uptake, but only a 10%\nincrease in the number of students\nattending. This, combined with the\nemphasis on the views of the Times\nHigher Education survey perhaps\nsuggesting that more work needs to be\ndone to get students on board.\nThe Student Experience section also\nmentions the Student Volunteering,\nJanuary\u2019s Give it a Go events and\nRefreshers\u2019 Fair, with all receiving\n\u201cpositive feedback\u201d.\nIn the \u201cAmplifying the Student\nVoice\u201d section, the report turns\nto celebrating the achievements\nof this year\u2019s officer trustees, in\nparticular Union President Tom\nWheeler, Deputy President (Welfare)\nChris Kaye and Deputy President\n(Education) Pascal Loose.\nThe Impact Report from Term\n1 focussed heavily on responses to\nnational surveys, but the report here\nhighlights the Union\u2019s wins on the\nStudent Academic Choice awards, the\ncontroversial \u201cvictory on halls rents\u201d,\nand the high turnout for this year\u2019s\nbig elections.\nThe report then turns to \u201cBuilding\na Student Community\u201d, in which\nmuch is made on the new \u2018Campaigns\u2019\nsections of the website. Mentality,\nICSexism and Fossil Free Imperial\nhave been active [Mentality is\nfeatured in this week\u2019s issue \u2013 ed]\nall term, with some being involved\nin (and outposts of) national\nmovements.\nThe report also documents the\nlaunch of: #impics, the Union\u2019s\nsponsored hashtag for clubs and\nsocieties, which has had 30 posts\nso far on Twitter; and h-bar\u2019s wine\ntasting event, which saw 20 attendees\nat the end of last term.\nThe final section of the report\nconcerns \u201cBuilding a Sustainable\nOrganisation\u201d, focussing on financial\nstability, work environment,\nand green impact. The report\nannounces the movement of payroll\nto eActivities, the increasingly\nubiquitous cyan and magenta themed\nweb portal for Union activity,\nand the retaining of Investors in\nPeople status. It is interesting that\nwhere sustainability is concerned,\nthere is no mention of the Union\u2019s\nstrategic aim to achieve Investing in\nVolunteers status.\nThe report concludes by stating that\nthe Union is \u201cproud to be a member-led organisation\u201d, referring to the\nofficer trustees.

I\nheard too many stories where the\nsupport given was just not good\nenough or non-existent.\u201d\nBeth said it was then they released\nthey needed to call for improvements,\none of the main aims behind the\nsurvey results.\nExplained Beth: \u201cI don\u2019t want\nstudents and staff to think that\nthe point of the survey report is to\nsay \u2018Look at how bad Imperial is,\neveryone here is really stressed. It\u2019s a\nterrible place to be!\u2019\nYes, some of the statistics are pretty\nshocking and the personal stories\npaint a very grim picture and we don\u2019t\nwant to shy away from that.\nHowever, I also want people to\nlook at the results and use them\nto challenge their own ideas and\npreconceptions about mental health,\nand to think a bit deeper about the\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nreasons behind these results and what\nthey can do to improve the situation.\u201d\nBeth uses the example of stress\nsurrounding exams and revision,\nsomething that 77% of the\nrespondents of the survey had\nexperienced at one point during their\ntime at Imperial. She explains that\nthe answer isn\u2019t to simply get rid of\nexams, coursework or deadlines, but\nto teach students to manage stress\nand academic pressures in a healthy\nand positive way.\n\u201cTo do this we could have\ndepartmental talks about dealing\nwith stress, increase publicity for\nworkshops run by the Counselling\nService and do more to dispel some\nof the false rumours and beliefs that\nstudents have about exams and the\nway they\u2019re moderated.\u201d\n\u201cThese are small changes which\ncould make a difference to lots of\nstudents.\u201d\nBeth also explained that we all\nneed to work together to improve\nthe mental wellbeing of students and\nstaff at Imperial.\nSaid Beth: \u201cWe all need to be\ninvolved, whether it\u2019s as a student,\ntaking the time to ask a friend how\nthey really are or as a senior staff\nmember in College, committing to\nexpanding the counselling service.\n\u201cI want this report to be a positive\nthing and to inspire change.\u201d\n\u201cI heard\ntoo many\nstories\nwhere the\nsupport\ngiven\nwas just\nnot good\nenough\nor nonexistent.\u201d\n\u201cI want\nthis report\nto be a\npositive\nthing and\nto inspire\nchange.\u201d\nIC Health centre has a\nlong waiting list and you\nhave to be refered if you\nare ill when there is an\nappointment.\nMy personal tutor was\namazing. He talked\nto me and we decided\ntogether that I would\ntake an interruption to\nstudies and then helped\nme get into the swing\nof things when I came\nback.\nIf you miss an\nappointment with your\nGP they don\u2019t check up on\nyou despite it being about\na mental illness; the fact\nthat you don\u2019t turn up\nshould raise a red flag.\nI felt like I may have\nintruded on the time of\nmy tutor.\nThe IC health centre\nwas sympathetic to my\nunderlying medical\ncondition that was\ncausing my poor medical\nstate and at that point\nhelped me to quickly\nfind a solution.\nHall warden belittled\nmy illness when I\nwent to seek help for\nproblems I was having\nwith my roommate that\nwere leaving me sleep\ndeprived and depressed.\nGP was very\nunderstanding and\ndid not belittle me in\nany way. I felt I was\ntaken seriously and was\ndirected immediately to\ncurrent support services.\nMy personal tutor provided\nclear advice and good\nsupport, and counselling\nfelt safe.\n\n"

It exists only for\nthe UK, with every other territory\nsimply being treated to the original\ntitle of Tomorrowland, sans subtitle.\nIt\u2019s a needless addition that tries to\ndefine the film further while failing\nto actually explain anything about\nwhat\u2019s going on. It\u2019s an apt metaphor\nfor the film, to be honest.\nTomorrowland (we\u2019re just calling it\nthat from now on) is the latest film\nto be based on part of the Disneyland\ntheme parks, joining the illustrious\nlikes of Pirates of the Caribbean and\u2026\nthe Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.\nThe other films to be based on\nDisney rides don\u2019t really bear talking\nabout, unless you want something to\ncomplain about.\nIt\u2019s got a far amount of promise\non paper despite that slightly\nworrisome heritage, though. Brad\nBird is the director responsible for\nPixar\u2019s classics The Incredibles and\nRatatouille, before making the leap\ninto live-action with the joyous\nMission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.\nThe cast features the likes of George\nClooney and Hugh Laurie. The script\nwas co-written by Bird with Damon\nLindelof, one of the main men\nbehind LOST. That\u2019s pretty much\nwhere the promise starts to dry up,\nreally. At least on paper.\nBritt Robertson gets her first major\nrole in this film, and she absolutely\nkills it. She plays Casey Newton, an\noptimist in a world going downhill,\nand a girl who sneaks onto the\nNASA launch site at Cape Canaveral,\ndisabling the machines dismantling\nthe pad. Robertson is a revelation,\ndisplaying deft comic timing and\ninfectious enthusiasm. She makes\nsome absolute clunkers of lines sound\nhilarious, and she pushes the film\nthrough several of its struggles. She\nlights up the film around her, which\nis why the way the script ultimately\ntreats her character is such a\ncrushing disappointment.\nCasey is constantly set up\nthroughout the film as being \u2018special\u2019.\nEverything appears to focus on\nher, and with the help of Raffedy\nCassidy\u2019s Athena she\u2019s the main\ndriving force of the plot. Quite why\nshe\u2019s special is never fully outlined\nfor most of the running time,\nalthough it slowly becomes clear that\nher special power is (drumroll please)\nthe power of positive thinking.\nAnd if you think this is a somewhat\npointless special power that has no\nability to push a plot forwards, then\ndon\u2019t worry. The filmmakers appear\nto agree with you. Casey is completely\nside-lined for the film\u2019s finale. That\nwhole section of the film is absurdly\nrushed \u2013 from the moment Casey,\nAthena and George Clooney\u2019s Frank\nWalker arrive in Tomorrowland\nitself, the plot barrels towards an\ninevitable \u201clet\u2019s blow everything up\u201d\nfinale. Sod positive thinking. We\nhave explosives.\nThose explosives signal the death\nknell for any hope that Tomorrowland\nmight pull itself together in the home\nstraight. Hugh Laurie\u2019s villain gets\nan entertaining speech that pulls\noff the marvellous trick of actually\nconvincing you that the villain might\nbe right (which admittedly, when\nthe heroes are as full of absolute\nfluff as the heroes of Tomorrowland\nare, doesn\u2019t require a huge amount\nof effort). George Clooney\u2019s natural\ncharm is allowed to shine through\nas his character starts to warm up.\nThere\u2019s some semi-decently shot\naction. It could all work, and then\nTomorrowland stumbles across its\nthematic football. It takes a run-up,\naims, and then completely misses\nand ends up sprawled in the dirt. It\u2019s\nsuch a waste.\nTomorrowland is an enjoyable ride,\nit should be said. It\u2019s enjoyable,\nbut heavily flawed. It never quite\nunderstands what its own message is,\nand during the few moments where\nthat message does start to flicker into\nlife it\u2019s complete nonsense. Most of\nthe acting is excellent, but it\u2019s forced\nto cope with an inadequate script\nthat has forgotten what it\u2019s trying to\ndo, and how it planned to do it in the\nfirst place.\nThis is a film to watch, once, enjoy,\nand then forget about. It doesn\u2019t\nsay anything worth hearing. It\nfails to stick in the memory, and\nthat\u2019s honestly a good thing. It\u2019s so\npainfully confused that it\u2019s almost\nupsetting. There\u2019s a lot of good work\nthat went into Tomorrowland, from\nthe sumptuous visuals to the sterling\nefforts of the cast. It\u2019s just buried\nbeneath a pile of meaningless junk.\nAll of the other promotional images were people standing in a field of corn. I\u2019m not even joking..

The students who\nlead Mentality are aware that any\nworking environment will have a\nlevel of stress, as I\u2019m sure many staff\naround the room can testify to.\n\u201cBut the \u2018good stress\u2019 that keeps\nyou motivated and produces results\ncan mutate into the bad stress that\nendangers your health and happiness.\nWe should not defend an overly\nstressful curriculum purely by\nclaiming it is academically necessary.\nThat is no defence at all.\u201d\nKeenan described how there is\na need to eliminate the causes of\nsuch pressures, not just to address\nthe symptoms. \u201cToo often do we\nhear students who have pileups of\ncoursework deadlines because their\nacademics have not coordinated with\neach other.\n\u201cToo often do we hear of\nintroductory talks at the start of the\nyear where staff and older students\ntalk up how scary and terrifying\ntheir workload is. We know there are\nprojects underway in Chemistry and\nother departments to tackle this \u2013 we\nask that every department does the\nsame.\u201d\nWheeler spoke to Felix about\nthe survey after the seminar. Said\nWheeler: \u201cAt Imperial College\nUnion, we are immensely proud of\nthe passionate, motivated students\nlike Bethany who are out to enable\nground-up progressive change for the\nstudent body at Imperial.\n\u201cThe results that have come from\nthe work Mentality has done is\nsending a clear, irrefutable message to\nevery level of the institution.\n\u201cI am currently working to ensure\nthat these messages are listened to\nand are not ignored.\n\u201cThe Vice-Provost (Education),\nProvost and President of College\nare all aware of Mentality\u2019s work,\nand from the conversations I\u2019ve had\nso far, there is a clear commitment\nto working together and taking\ncollaborative responsibility for the\nmental wellbeing of our community.\u201d\nProfessor Debra Humphris, Vice\nProvost (Education), said: \u201cI\u2019m very\ngrateful to Beth for her work on\nleading the Mentality campaign and\nproducing this helpful report.\n\u201cWe have a bright, hardworking\nand creative student community\nat Imperial, and we need to\nensure they\u2019re able to excel - both\nacademically, and personally.

Of the 43\nconstituencies, just one voted against\nthe amendment.\nThe Republic of Ireland\u2019s first\nopenly gay minister, The Minister for\nHealth Leo Varadkar, said the \u201cYes\u201d\ncampaign had been \u201calmost like a\nsocial revolution\u201d.\nThe Yes vote was supported by\nthe Government as well as all major\npolitical parties. The final result was\nannounced on Saturday afternoon,\nafter polls closed at 10pm on Friday\nwith reports of \u201cunusually high\u201d\nturnouts for a vote on amending the\nconstitution. The total turnout was\n60.5%.\nIrish citizens who are registered\nwere allowed to vote, and many people\nreturned home to Ireland to cast their\nvote.\nThis historic referendum comes\nonly 22 years after homosexual\nacts were decriminalised in Ireland,\nand just five years since the Irish\ngovernment first enacted civil\npartnership legislation, which\nprovided legal recognition for gay\ncouples.\nCivil partnerships were a big step\nforward, but unlike marriages they are\nnot protected in the constitution.\nThe Catholic Church, a large voice\nfor the No vote, has seen its influence\nweaken in Ireland after child abuse\nscandals and the number of those\nattending church on Sundays has\n\u201cthe \u201cYes\u201d\nvote had\nwon with\n62.1% of the\nvote\u201d\n\u201cIt is\nclear the\namendment\nhas a strong\nmandate\nfrom the\npeople\u201d\ndropped off in the last two decades.\nThis gay marriage vote represents\nthe latest pillar to fall in the social\nprogression of Ireland \u2013 the previous\nmilestones including divorce in\n1995. Many commentators expect a\nreferendum on legalising abortion to\nbe on the horizon.\nSame-sex marriages became legal\nin England and Wales in 2013, with\nScotland closely following in 2014.\nNow, with the Republic of Ireland\nlegalising same-sex marriage in 2015,\nonly Northern Ireland is left as the\nlast place in the British isles resisting\nJOSHUA RENKEN\nSECTION EDITOR\nIreland votes \u201cYes\u201d to legalising same-sex marriage\nlegislation.\nAll countries before Ireland had\nlegalised same-sex marriage through\nthe national legislature or the courts.\nThis Irish vote puts the number of\ncountries where same-sex marriage is\nlegal to 20, but homosexuality is still a\ncrime in 77 countries, and carries the\ndeath penalty in seven.\nNo campaigners say they still have\nquestions surrounding child adoption\nand surrogacy for gay couples, but\nit is clear that the amendment has a\nstrong mandate from the people of the\nRepublic of Ireland.\nMembers of the Yes Campaign celebrate victory. Photo: Associated Press\nOn Wednesday the 27th\nMay, 20 days\nafter the general election, the Queen\noutlined the proposed legislation of\nthe new government.\nThe speech included promises that\nher government would guarantee an\nEU refrendum by the end of 2017,\nafter a sort period of negotiation\nwith other European nations and the\ncurrent President of the European\nCommission Jean-Claude Juncker.\nAlso in the speech was a proposed\npiece of legislation banning any\nincreases in income tax, VAT and\nnational insurance over the next five\nyears.\nMore devolution for Scotland, Wales\nand Northern Ireland have been\npledged together with \u201cEnglish votes\nfor English laws\u201d in Westminster.\nThe speech included the\nestablishment of a \u201ctruly seven day\u201d\nNHS by 2020, and a promise to create\n500 more free schools and turn failing\nschools into Academies.\nThe Conservatives want parents\nto receive 30 hours a week of free\nchildcare for three to four-year olds\nby 2017, while freezing working age\nbenefits, tax credits and child benefit\nfor two years over the course of\nparliament from 2016/2017. In this\nparliament the maximum amount that\none household can claim in benefits\nwill drop from \u00a326,000 to \u00a323,000.\nMany of these proposals were\npromised by the Conservatives during\nthe election campaign, and David\nCameron can now pass proposals in\nthe House of Commons that he never\ncould in coalition with the Liberal\nDemocrats.\nOne such proposal is the plan to\nscrap to scrap the Human Rights Act\nand replace it with a \u201cBritish Bill\nof Rights.\u201d However, Cameron has\ndelayed the plans to avoid potential\nrebellion from his backbenchers. But\nthere is no doubting that it will be\npursued.\nThe speech did not mention the\nConservative\u2019s plan to hold a free\nCommons vote on repealing the\nfox hunting ban, but environment\nsecretary Liz Truss has reassured the\npublic that it will go ahead before\n2020.\nThis is the first Conservative\nQueen\u2019s Speech in nearly two decades,\nand comes after an historic victory\nfor David Cameron, who is the first\nBritish Prime Minister to be re-elected\nimmediately after serving a full term\nwith an increased popular vote share\nsince 1900. 2015\u2019s results also made\nCameron the the only Prime Minister\nother than Margaret Thatcher to be reelected immediately after a full term\nwith a greater share of the seats.\nOur future: as told by Her Majesty\nJoshua Renken covers the Government\u2019s Agenda\nPomp and Ceremony: setting out the future for the UK\n\n"

The communist regime\nof Ceau\u0219escu in the late 20th\ncentury\npushed the country into poverty.\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union\nand the Communist Party in 1991\nRomania has been trying to rebuild\nits economy and reaffirm its identity\nas a country with a long history and\nimportant heritage.\nThe main conclusion of this\nfascinating walking tour was that\nBucharest is a very surprising city\nof contrasts both culturally and\narchitecturally, with a mix of newly\nbuilt \u201816th\ncentury Parisian\u2019-style\nbuildings, closed down buildings in\nruins and flamboyant landmarks\nfrom Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s rule and the\nrevolution, such as the Palace of\nParliament and the controversial\n\u2018Potato on a stick\u2019. This walking tour\nprovided a great end to a busy and\ninsightful day, which was brought\nto a close with further discovery of\nthe Bucharest nightlife and more\nbonding between years.\nDay 3\nDay 3 started off with the group split\nin two. Whilst one of the groups\nheaded west in the city to a large\nmetro project site, the other half\nheaded to the north of the city to the\nsite of Bucharest One. The first site\ngave the students the opportunity to\nsee first-hand what a tunnel boring\nmachine (TBM) looks like and the full\nsize of them.\nThe tour started with a trip down\ntwo levels in the station to see the\nTBM and the tunnel. The tunnel had\njust been completed and they were\nat the stage of shotcreting the walls\nof the tunnels to prevent flooding\nwithin the station. The site was a\ngreat chance for the student to see\nhow complex the engineering can\nbecome when working in a location\nwith a high groundwater table. It\nwas a topical site visit considering\nthe amount of tunnelling that is\ncurrently going on in London with\nCrossrail.\nThe Bucharest One site contrasted\nthe metro project and allowed the\nstudents to see how buildings are\nconstructed in near proximity and on\ntop of tube lines. It was fascinating to\nsee the site having had the talk on it\nat the Technical University the day\nbefore. On completion, the office\nbuilding will be the second tallest\nbuilding in Romania. Students were\nfirst given a short presentation by the\nsite manager and it was impressive\nto see that they were, unusually,\nahead of schedule! From the site\noffice, the students were then led\naround the site, first going down\ninto the basement levels and then up\nto the sixth floor from where there\nwas a surprisingly good view of the\nsurrounding area. Some particularly\ninteresting features of the site were\nthe methods that were incorporated\nto account for the location of the\nbuilding over the metro lines. Large\nmovement joints and uncoupling of\nthe walls were observed and it was\ngreat for the students to see things\nthat they have learnt at university put\ninto practice.\nAfter lunch the whole group went to\nthe Romanian Palace of Parliament\nfor a group tour of the magnificent\nyet controversial building. Even with\nthe knowledge that it is the second\nlargest building in the world, the\ngroup was overwhelmed by the sheer\nsize of it in person and the space\ninside. It was a fascinating tour led\nby a very enthusiastic tour guide, and\nenabled the students to learn even\nmore about the history of Bucharest\nand the communist leader Nicolae\nCeau\u0219escu. The dictator ordered the\nconstruction of this building as a\nmonument to his communist rule,\nbut never saw it finished as it was\ncompleted in 1994, three years after\nhis decapitation. This impressive\nand imposing building, which was\nvalued at $4 billion at the time\nof its construction, is extremely\ncontroversial, as the marble and\nlavish ornamentation does not reflect\nthe situation of poverty the entire\ncountry was in during the late 1980s.\nThe sheer size of the Palace and the\nvisiting restrictions meant that we\nwere only able to visit 5% of the\nbuilding, but the group was allowed to\ngo out onto the balcony of the palace\nfrom where they enjoyed a fantastic\nview of the city.\nDay 4\nFor the final full day in Bucharest\nthe students were given a free and\nrelaxing day with nothing planned\nand were allowed to visit the different\nattractions as they liked. One of\nthe main activities of the day was\nvisiting the North of Bucharest,\nwhich had a number of parks and\ngreen areas for the students to\nenjoy a picnic and make the most\nof the weather. This was also the\nlocation of the \u2018Romanian Arc de\nTriomphe\u2019, a smaller version of the\nfamous Parisian landmark, depicting\nBucharest once again as the \u2018Little\nParis\u2019. The freedom and flexibility\nof the day was received with positive\nfeedback as each individual was able\nto do what they liked without being\nconfined to a group of 70.\nThe students were able to experience\nthe broad attractions that Bucharest\nhad to offer according to their likes\nand dislikes. In the evening there\nwas a group meal that had been\nplanned in advance at the City Grill\nRestaurant. The restaurant was highly\naccommodating and the food and\natmosphere was greatly enjoyed by\nall. It was a fantastic opportunity\nfor the students to share the week\u2019s\nexperiences and to sample the local\ncuisine one last time.\nDay 5\nSadly, the final day of the tour came\nabout and the group made their way\nto Bucharest Airport via coach for the\nbittersweet voyage back to London.\nThe coach journey provided safe\nand easy transportation and gave\nthe students a chance to reflect as we\ndrove past the sites one last time.\nThe CivSoc International Tour\n2015 was a highly successful event\nand it achieved above and beyond\nthe goals set out by the committee.\nThere were no serious issues, and\neverything went according to plan\nand, most impressively, we stayed\nin budget! The tour provided the\nstudents with a perfect balance\nbetween an educational and relaxing\nweek away. Not only did the Tour\nachieve its main goals for the event\nallowing students to experience Civil\nEngineering in a foreign country,\nthe students were also given the\neducational experience of history,\nculture and technical knowledge.\nThe social aspect of the tour has\nenabled the students from all years\nto come together and form great\nfriendships. The feedback received\nfrom the participants was incredibly\npositive and it has been seen since\nthat there is more integration\nwithin the years and excitement\nfor other upcoming CivSoc events.\nThe great success of this year\u2019s tour\nhas certainly built excitement and\nenthusiasm for Civsoc International\nTour 2016 and whatever it may hold.\nCivSoc Tour 2015 would not\nhave been able to happen and most\ncertainly not such a success without\nthe generous support from our\npartners. At this point I would like\nto thank BP, IC Union, the OC Trust\n(CGCA), CCC, Vinci Construction and\nthe Civil Engineering Department of\nImperial College London. Thank you\nso much on behalf of all the students\nand I hope we can continue this\ncollaboration in the future!\n\n"

We have the\nhighest percentage of students in careers after 6\nmonths of graduation, an achievement no other\nUniversity can match. And we came higher than\nthose wankers at UCL. Get in.\u201d\nThe weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building\nBlue News\nProvost Post\nof the Week\nEvery week, a member of\nour esteemed Provost board\nshares their thoughts with\nour collaborative, cohesive\ncommunity. This week, we\nwelcome back Al Pologies,\nVice Provost (Arbitrary\nExcuses)!\nSadly, further unforeseen\ncircumstances have lead to Al\u2019s\ncontinued absence from his\ndesk.\nIn fact, we\u2019d like to use Al\u2019s\nnow-empty column to take\nthe opportunity to introduce\nour brand new Tactical\nInitiative Task Squad (Student\nSatisfaction). Lead by our\nSwedish Vice Provost (League\nTables), Knott Gudenuff,\njust one of our many valued\ninternational members of\nthe Faculty team, the Tactical\nInitiative Task Squad have been\ntasked (haha!) with taking the\ninitiative (haha!) on our student\nsatisfaction ratings, to help\nmake sure that we can inflate\nthose numbers and climb the\nleague tables.\nWe\u2019re inviting staff members\nto design the posters that will\nshortly be going up across the\nSouth Kensington campus,\nencouraging students to sign\nup to come along to meetings\nof TITSSS.

We\u2019ve got plenty of\ntitillating tidbits laced with an indulgent dollop of information to make\nsure you stay informed of everything going on in the world-leading\ninstitution of Imperial College London this week.\nI\u2019m sure you all awaited with baited breath the release of that liberal rag\nwell-renowned newspaper, The Guardian\u2019s league table this week, which\nlooks at a variety of factors to determine an overall \u2018rating\u2019 out of 100 for\neach University, which are then collectively ranked based on that rating.\nFor reasons none of us here in the Faculty Building can quite understand,\nthis list of factors includes student satisfaction!\nSo, unfortunately, we must come to the conclusion that when it comes\nto league tables based on student satisfaction, students are our biggest\nasset. We know that these league tables are inferior to ones we already\nsit atop, such as those measuring research, number of highly credited\n(even Nobel Prize winning!) professors, or even quality staff newsletters,\nbut we can\u2019t truly claim to be world-leading in every field (as we all know\nwe are) until we\u2019ve crushed the opposition on every playing fields.\nTo use a sporting analogy, Manchester Football Club may win the Top\nFootball League and be world-leading, but if they lose their games with\nLiverpool United Football Club, can they still be said to be the superior\nteam? No, no they can\u2019t. And the same is true of Universities, which are\nobviously much bigger and far more important than sports.\nSo yes, we may disagree with the bloody liberals Guardian journalists\non their methods behind the tables, but we must also respect that some\nvery important people look at these tables when considering which\nUniversity to sponsor or donate vast sums of money to. And for that\nreason, if nothing else, we should strive to achieve higher in all aspects\nof these tables.\nIf that means improving student satisfaction, so be it.\nHave a productive, cohesive, collaborative and happy day!\n\n"

Yet the\nproduction is much more than a mere\nhomage to one of the most iconic\ndesigners; the story it tells is neither\nthe shocking drugs-and-depression\ntabloid version nor the glamorous\nVogue version, though both are\nreferenced in a stylised, indirect\nmanner throughout. It is primarily\nthe story of a person, and his\nrelationship to reality. It transcends\nthe narrow confines of the haute\ncouture celebrity world, portraying\nan experience which deeply resonates\nwith the everyday struggles of human\nemotion.\nThe story is set in a single fantasy\nnight, a Tim Burtonesque fairy-tale\nnightmare reminiscent of McQueen\u2019s\nfashion shows. An obsessed groupie\nbreaks into his house to steal a\ndress and, when caught, she and\nthe designer start talking. She takes\non the role of his inner voice as the\ntwo travel through his memories\nand relive key moments from his\nlife. The dynamic between the two\nis completely absorbing \u2013 it\u2019s never\nclear whether she is real or imaginary,\nwhich creates the disorientating\nfeeling of being inside someone\u2019s\nthoughts. Alexander McQueen is\nplayed by Stephen Wright who,\nbeyond his uncanny similarity\nto the real designer, brings an\nexciting, almost scary energy to\nthe role. Dahlia, the groupie-cum-alter ego, is played Dianna Agron,\nknown principally from her role\nas Quinn Fabray in Glee. She gives\nan unsettling performance, easily\nchanging between devoted fan, fairy\ntale waif, and suicidal psychopath.\nThere\u2019s something desperate about\nher character, a deranged neediness\nof incredible emotional power. It\u2019s\nnot all depressing \u2013 moments of\nlaughter and comedy make this\nplay an emotional whirlwind, based\non real emotion rather than cheap\ntear-jerking tricks. It avoids being\nmorbid or mawkish and, perhaps\nparadoxically, there\u2019s something very\nreal and vital about McQueen.\nThe dream-like quality of the two\nmain characters is enhanced with\nsome very original staging decisions.\nChristopher Manney has created\ndisconcerting choreographies, with a\ntop notch dancing troupe who have\nan unusually high level of technical\nskill for a theatrical production. They\nanimate each scene as mannequins,\ncreeping out from the wings and\nwhirling around Alexander and\nDalhia, unearthly representations of\ntheir inner turmoil. The sets are full\nof references to the designer\u2019s work,\nwith Timothy Bird\u2019s clever video\ndesign combining with the costume\ndesign to recreate the essence of\nFor every action there is an\nequal and opposite reaction.\nIt seems this rule holds as\ntrue in theatre as it does in physics.\nAfter the cerebral existentialism\nof The Hard Problem, the bells-and-whistles approach of Rules for Living,\nand the highly modern adaptation\nof Everyman, the National Theatre\nreturn to well-worn theatrical\ntraditions. The Beaux\u2019 Stratagem\nis a streamlined, watertight\nperformance; it doesn\u2019t offer any\nradical reinterpretation of restoration\ncomedy \u2013 and perhaps it doesn\u2019t have\nto \u2013 but this means that, despite the\nability of the cast and crew, it remains\nlittle more than a light diversion.\nOne of the last examples of a\nComedy of Manners, The Beaux\u2019\nStratagem was the last play of Irish\nplaywright George Farquhar, and \u2013\nlike a majority of works of its time \u2013\nhas a convoluted, twisting plot, full of\ndouble-dealings, misunderstandings,\nand bawdy humour: Aimwell and\nArcher, the two beaux of titular fame,\nfind themselves down on their luck,\ntheir squandering of ten thousand\npounds in London leading them to\nLichfield, where they enact a plan to\nensnare a wealthy bride. Aimwell falls\nin love with Dorinda, while Archer\nsimultaneously woos Dorinda\u2019s sister-in-law, Mrs Sullen, and Cherry, the\ndaughter of landlord Boniface. There\nare a few obstacles to their plan: Mr\nSullen is still in the picture, despite\nthe fact that his send-up of a country\nsquire is the very opposite of the\nrefined London character of his wife;\nBoniface thinks the two gentlemen\nare highwaymen, come to rob the\nladies\u2019 house; and then there are\nthe French prisoners of war to deal\nwith. Make no mistake, The Beaux\u2019\nStratagem is as convoluted as they\ncome, but the twists and turns of the\nplot are softened by the wit contained\nwithin Farquhar\u2019s script.\nHowever, The Beaux Stratagem\nalso deals with more serious themes,\nmainly the restrictive marriage laws\nin England at the time, which made\ndivorce pretty much non-existent.\nThis argument reaches a height in a\ncourtroom-style scene that sees Mr\nand Mrs Sullen arguing their cases,\nwith Mrs Sullen aptly comparing the\ngolden links of wedlock to the iron\nmanacles of law. After all the bustle\nof the play, this interlude comes as a\nsurprise, perhaps due to the fact that\nmuch of the sophisticated language\nis cribbed from John Milton, giving\nit an incongruous edge. Set designer\nLizzie Clachan has created a solid\nstaging, with a multi-tiered house\nwhose clever mechanics allow it\nto switch from a country inn to a\nmanor house, underlining the fact\nthat little separates the behaviour of\nthe characters but money. Outside\nthis set, two other places lurk out of\nFRED FYLES\nSECTION EDITOR\n\"The Beaux\u2019\nStratagem\nis a return\nto the\nNational\u2019s\nwell-worn\ntheatrical\ntraditions\"\n\"Fielding\nand\nBennettWarner\ntackle their\nmeaty\nparts with\naplomb\"\nMcQueen\u2019s creations.\nAvoiding the pedantry of\ndocumentary and the maudlin\nof tragic biopics, McQueen is a\nrare thing: a moving play with\nimpeccable production standards,\nwhere everything from the script\nto the costume details is perfect.\nIt encapsulates the essence of a\ncreative genius, while transposing\nhis struggles into everyone else\u2019s. In\ndoing so it achieves the theatrical\ngolden standard of enchantment and\ncatharsis, giving the audience a few\nhours of enthralled, ethereal escape.\nMcQueen is on at the St James Theatre\nuntil 27th\nJune. Tickets from \u00a325.\nAvailable online.\nsight: the London so esteemed by\nMrs Sullen, and the growing threat of\nan expanding France, both of which\ncolour the plot.\nThere are no complaints to be made\nabout the casting, with each actor\nhandling their part with confidence;\nparticular mention should go\nto Susannah Fielding and Pippa\nBennett-Warner, who play Mrs Sullen\nand Dorinda, respectively. They\ntackle the meaty parts with aplomb,\ntransforming them into creatures of\ncomic timing and wit, who seem to be\nprototypes of the Austen heroine who\nwould come to prominence at the end\nof the century.\nThe Beaux Stratagem is a fine play,\nwith a solid cast whose skills are\naccentuated by the traditional set\ndesign and strong direction of Simon\nGodwin; it equals exactly the sum of\nits parts. It may not exactly thrill, but\nit certainly won\u2019t disappoint.\nThe Beaux\u2019 Stratagem is on at the\nNational Theatre until 20th\nSeptember.\n\n"

It comes\nat a time where we\u2019re all busy with\nproject work and exams, and the last\nthing we want is to be worried about\nwhether or not we\u2019ll be homeless next\nyear.\nHaving been in London and having\nbeen forced to deal with the private\naccommodation sector for three years\nnow, I\u2019ve picked up a few things that\nwill be useful to keep in mind when\nlooking for a new place to live.\nPick a decent estate agent\nIt\u2019s no secret that estate agents\nhave a tendency to bleed you dry\nwith different administration costs\nranging from verifying guarantors\nto taking inventory, but some are\nworse than others so do your research\nbefore you decide which estate\nagent you want to sell your soul to.\nYour first point of contact should\nbe your friends who have had to\ndeal with them before, they are the\nones who know how responsive the\nestate agents\u2019 are when it comes to\nresponding to your email about the\nfaulty fire alarm versus how quickly\nthey get on your case about the mould\nthey saw on one corner of the kitchen\nwindow when they came for their\nbiannual inspection. If that sounds\noddly specific, it\u2019s because it IS, and\neveryone who has had to deal with\nestate agents has stories like these,\nso make sure to ask around! If you\ndon\u2019t feel comfortable enough asking,\nonline reviews are also a good place\nto check.\nTransport links\nAlthough most students tend\nto congregate in the usual areas\nlike High Street Kensington and\nHammersmith, you might choose to\nwander a bit further from campus,\nand that\u2019s fine! The most important\nthing to take into account is how\nexactly you\u2019re going to make it in\nfor your 9am lecture. If you cycle,\nmake sure to check out the route\nbefore deciding on a place to make\nsure you can handle doing it almost\nevery day for 9 months come hell or\nhigh water. If you\u2019re a bus person,\ncheck to see if there are any 24 hour\nroutes near you for those late nights\nin the lab. You don\u2019t want to have to\nbe forced to camp out in the library\nbecause you missed the last bus. Also,\nit\u2019s worth thinking about the rent vs\ntransport costs issue. Obviously, if\nyou\u2019re closer to campus and generally\nwalk, you can afford to spend a little\nmore on rent, but if you were going to\ntake a bus anyway, it might be worth\nthinking about moving a little further\naway to save some money seeing as\nhow you were going to invest in a bus\npass either way.\nBudget for utilities\nSomething some of us forget to\naccount for when looking for a\nnew place, especially if it\u2019s our first\ntime paying for utilities directly, is\nbudgeting for how much they cost.\nThis is a fairly easy thing to figure\nout, just ask the current tenants\nroughly how much they pay. If they\ndon\u2019t know, or aren\u2019t there when\nyou go to look around, you could\nalways ask the person who\u2019s showing\nyou around or check online for the\naverage cost for the area and then\nadjust it slightly. As a general rule,\nstudents tend to spend more than\nthe average on electricity (because of\ncomputers, gaming equipment, and\nlate nights) and less on gas (because\nwe\u2019re lazy and don\u2019t cook as much,\nand tend to spend less time at home\nso don\u2019t have the heating on as often\nas the average family).\nInsulation\nDefinitely ask about the insulation\nin the flat. Are the windows double\nglazed? Is it a corner property or\nare there people on either side you\ncan mooch heat off of? It\u2019s not that\npressing an issue in June when\nyou\u2019re looking for a flat, but come\nNovember, you\u2019ll be glad you paid\nattention to the windows when you\u2019re\nnot spending a fortune on heating or\nfreezing your arse off while wearing\nfifty different layers.\nPay attention to the hob, washing\nmachine, and fridge!\nDo all the burners work? How old is\nthe washing machine? Does it have a\ndryer? Is the fridge big enough for the\nnumber of people you have in your\nflat? Not enough people tell you this,\nbecause it seems like common sense,\nbut if it\u2019s your first time looking for a\nflat you tend to overlook these kinds\nof things, which is how I ended up\nliving in a flat sharing one minifridge\nbetween 4 people. Also, I cannot stress\nhow important it is to have a freezer!\nFreezers save lives (and money,\nmostly money)! The condition of\nthe appliances can drastically affect\nyour quality of life not only because\nyou\u2019re the one who has to use them\nfor at least a year, but also because\nthey reflect how much of a shit the\nlandlord gives about their tenants.\nMould sucks and you don\u2019t want\nany\nThis is probably something that\nyou hear all the time, but I know I\u2019ve\nbeen guilty of forgetting all about\nit in my excitement about the fact\nthat \u201cwow, so the TV comes with the\nflat?\u201d. Checking for mould is super\nimportant, and not just because it can\ncause respiratory problems. Mould\ngenerally means there is a humidity\nproblem in the property and there is\nmost probably nothing you can do\nabout. Humidity in a house is awful,\nyour clothes don\u2019t ever dry, you can\u2019t\nleave anything on your windowsill\nwithout it getting soaked, and perhaps\nworst of all, it messes with your WiFi\nsignal! So if you care about having a\ndecent internet connection, and let\u2019s\nbe honest, we all do, you\u2019ll check the\ncorners and windows for mould.\nThese are obviously just a few\nthings to take into account before\ndeciding on a property, so make sure\nto look online for more advice. And\nremember, the student hub is great\nfor this kind of thing.\nThe drean house you\u2019re undoubtedly going to build in minecraft to forget the hole actually live in.

Only 15% of the\ntotal respondents said they had\nexperienced no mental health\nconditions or damaging stress levels\nat all.\nOut of those who have been\ndiagnosed with a mental health\ncondition, 67% suffer from\ndepression, 42.4% suffer from\nanxiety, and 16% suffer from an\neating disorder, amongst others. 42%\nof all those diagnosed with a mental\nhealth condition were suffering from\nmultiple illnesses.\nThe survey also found that 69.5%\nof those that suffer from stress do\nso at least once a week, and 9% of\nstudents feel stressed constantly. 1 in\n2 students feel anxious at least once a\nweek, and nearly a quarter of students\nfeel self-loathing over the same\nperiod of time.\n36% of all respondents to the survey\nsaid they have had thoughts of self\nharm at least once a year, and 35%\nreported they had have thoughts of\nsuicide over the same time period.\n9% of respondents reported having\nsuicidal thoughts at least once a week.\nWhen students described the\nvarious sources of their mental\ndistress, 77% cited exams and\nrevision, 64% cited concern over\ngrades and academic performance,\nand 60% cited worry over balancing\nstudying with other commitments.\nOf note was that 35% of students\nworry over employability, despite\nImperial being ranked first in the\nUK for career prospects in a recent\nGuardian university league table.\nWhen dividing the data by gender,\nit was interesting to note that\nfemales and males suffered from\ndifferent causes of stress at different\nproportions.\nFor males, 73% cited exams and\nrevision as a cause of stress, whilst\n82% of females cited exams and\nrevision as a cause. 56% of females\ncited low self-esteem as a cause of\nstress, whilst only 34% of males stated\nthat self-esteem caused them mental\ndistress too.\n144 postgraduate students also\nfilled in the survey, and 23% cited\npublication pressure as a cause\nfor mental stress. 19% also stated\nthat their relation with supervisor\ncauses stress. 1 in 3 cited financial\ndifficulties as something that lead to\nstress too.\nWhen looking at the results\ncollected from LGBT students, it\nwas found that 38% of those that\nidentify as either lesbian, gay,\nbisexual or queer find issues related\nto sexual orientation as causes for\nstress. Low self-esteem affected a\nhigher proportion of LGBT students\nwhen compared to as a whole to the\nstudents who identify as heterosexual.\nThe survey also addressed what\nprovisions students were aware were\navailable at Imperial, and how many\nstudents had used in the past. 28%\nof students said they didn\u2019t disclose\ntheir feelings of mental distress with\nanyone, although more than half did\nsay they confided in friends. 20%\nsaid they saw a GP, and 13% said they\napproached their personal tutor.\nAround 1 in 4 students who have\nbeen diagnosed with a mental illness\nsaid they did not access any of the\nsupport services at Imperial. Out of\nthose who had used the services, 19%\nsaid they didn\u2019t know where to find\ninformation about the services, whilst\n16% said they had issues with long\nwaiting times.\nThe survey was designed and ran\nby Imperial College Union campaign\ngroup Mentality, and collected data\nthrough an online questionnaire\ncirculated last term.\nMentality has been campaigning\nthroughout the year to raise\nawareness around mental wellbeing at\nImperial, and educate students about\nthe importance of mental health. The\nsurvey results were published in a\nreport earlier this week.\nThe report included a list of\nrecommendations for improvements\nthat could be made to the services\navailable, which included reviewing\nand improving the training of\npersonal tutors, hall wardens and hall\nseniors, and the potential to set up a\ntrained student peer support groups,\nwhich are proving beneficial to be in\nother universities across the country.\nThe report also outlined\nimprovements that could be made to\nthe Counselling services, including\nintroducing \u201cout of hours\u201d support\nand extra provisions during more\nintense times of the year.\nThe Mentality campaign is lead\nby Beth Davison, a second year\nundergraduate student studying\nphysics. She was inspired to start\nthe campaign after suffering from\ndepression in her first year of study.\nThe results of the survey were\nreleased earlier this week during\nthe 7th\nAnnual Welfare Seminar\n\u201cThe Problems students face,\u201d that\ntook place in the Royal School\nof Mines building. Beth, other\nstudents involved with the Mentality\nCampaign, and members of Imperial\nCollege Union staff presented the\nresults to members of College staff\npresent at the seminar.\nThe seminar was not open to\nstudents to attend. However\nrepresentatives from Imperial\nCollege Union, including Union\nPresident Tom Wheeler, engaged in\nThe survey said that 21% of people had been diagnosed with a mental health condition.

My role is to investigate\nall crime, deliver a gold standard\nof victim care, and implement\nprevention tactics and strategies\nto reduce crime and the number of\nvictims. What I bring to this role\ncomes from serving 30 years in the\nMetropolitan Police service from\nwhich I retired this February.\nWhat is exceptionally important to\nme is the way that victims of crime\nare treated. As a result I have created\na new Victim Charter; this ensures\nall victims will be treated with\ndignity, respect and understanding.\nCommunications will be open,\nhonest, and transparent and victims\nwill be treated in line with their\nneeds and wishes rather than treating\neveryone the same. The charter\nalso assures that no matter what\nthe severity of a crime, all victims\nare fully supported and advised\nfrom cradle to grave throughout\ninvestigations.\nThe security teams, as well as\nmyself, are also very keen to support\nany actions or events being organised\nby the student Union or assist in\norganising event. Areas such as\npersonal safety/security talks and\nbike/property marking events helping\nto ensure our students have a safe and\nenjoyable college life.\nSince starting, the two main crimes\nthat have been all too apparent,\nimpacting the most and creating\nvictims of crime are theft of pedal\nby tailgating people in and then out\nwith stolen bikes and scaling fencing.\nThieves have been captured on CCTV\nwalking onto the campus on foot\ndressed in full cycling gear, helmets,\nglasses, pollution masks and lycra\nshorts and then minute\u2019s later riding\nout again on stolen bikes.\nThe many laptops that have been\ntaken have, mainly, been stolen\nwhen left unattended in insecure\nareas such as open plan offices,\ncommunal areas in halls of residence,\nunlocked classrooms, and eating\nestablishments. Suspects have,\nagain, managed to enter secure areas\nthrough tailgating and unfortunately\nthieves will target the College campus\nas they see it as an easy target where\nelectronics are left unattended. The\nexample I usually give is you would\nnot leave \u00a31500 cash sitting on a table\nin an office or communal area and\nexpect it to stay there while you go\nget a coffee, so then why do it with\na computer, phone, or tablet worth\nsimilar amounts of money.\n\"You\nwouldn\u2019t\nleave \u00a31500\ncash sitting\non a table.\"\ncycles and theft of laptops. In the\nlast six weeks 13 Laptops and 6 bikes\nhave been stolen. In total the value\nof the items stolen is approximately\n\u00a315,000 and some of the crimes were\nabsolutely preventable.\nInvestigation findings\nBicycles on the whole have been\nstolen by professional thieves\ntargeting bike storage areas and\ncutting off inferior security devices\nsuch as cable locks.

His latest\nalbum, The Desired Effect, wanders\neven further down the road of 80s\nsoft rock, arguably drawing a much\nclearer line between The Killers and\nFlowers as a solo artist. Compare\nBattle Born (The Killers\u2019 last album)\nand The Desired Effect, and you\u2019ll find\ntwo very, very different beasts.\nOf course, regardless of that sonic\ndivide, the lead singer of any popular\nband going solo comes with certain\nexpectations. You only need look\nat Gerard Way\u2019s recent(ish) solo\ntours, and how they sold out almost\ninstantly on the back of his work in\nMy Chemical Romance to find proof\nof that. Should you need further\nproof, simply turn up to any of Way\u2019s\ngigs. If the sheer quantity of people\nwearing My Chemical Romance shirts\ndon\u2019t convince you, nothing will.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Flower\u2019s\nfirst slot at the O2 Academy, Brixton\nsold out in less than a minute. A\nsecond date was added, and sold out\na minute after that went on sale.\nObviously.\nThe stalls of the Academy fill\nout rapidly. The support act get a\nmoderate reaction, although the\nloudest whoops are reserved for the\nmoment where they thank Flowers\nfor giving them the support slot. They\ndisappear, then after a longer wait\nthan expected, the lights dim, and\nFlowers\u2019 supporting band take to the\nstage. It\u2019s all moody lighting, and a\nhell of a lot of cheering, whooping,\nscreaming. Then Flowers strides\nout in a glittery jacket, and all hell\nbreaks loose. A brief moment for him\nto acknowledge the audience, then\nhe kicks right off into Desired Effect\nopener, \u2018Dreams Come True\u2019.\nIt\u2019s followed quickly by second\ntrack (and lead single) \u2018Can\u2019t Deny\nMy Love\u2019, suggesting this might\nbe a straight run-through of the\nnew album (don\u2019t worry, it wasn\u2019t).\nThroughout, Flowers hardly ever\nstands still, moving the length of\nthe stage repeatedly. Everyone in\nthis room has paid to see them, and\neveryone\u2019s going to get a chance\nto. He hops up onto the monitors,\nlapping up the excitement of the\ncrowd, holding the microphone out to\nlet the crowd fill the gaps he leaves in\nthe chorus. He\u2019s loving every minute,\nand so are the crowd.\nFlowers doesn\u2019t talk much through\nthose tracks and next song \u2018Crossfire\u2019,\nthe big hit from Flamingo. There\u2019s\nthe traditional \u201cHello London\u201d, but\nthat\u2019s pretty much it. \u2018Magdalena\u2019\ngets his first little speech of the night,\nexplaining the context behind the\nsong. \u2018Hard Enough\u2019 is the first quiet\nmoment of the night, before Flowers\ndrops his trump card. Gerard Way\nopted not to play any of My Chemical\nRomance\u2019s songs during his first UK\ntour. Flowers is less concerned about\nany of that.\nHe gives a short spiel on how this\ntour has given him a chance to look\nat Killers songs anew, reworking\nthem into something new, something\ndifferent. The crowd, predictably,\ngoes bananas. With that, an\nacoustic(ish), moody version of \u2018Jenny\nWas a Friend of Mine\u2019. It feels like\nit\u2019s been stripped out of a Western,\na dark, country-esque version of the\nclassic. And it\u2019s wonderful.\n\u2018Jenny\u2019 is quickly followed up by the\npunchy, irresistible \u2018Lonely Town\u2019\nand the driving \u2018I Can Change\u2019 (both\nfrom the new album), before The\nKillers rear their head again in the\nshape of \u2018Read My Mind\u2019. The crowd\nknow every word, and this new spin\non the song goes down just as well,\nif not better, than \u2018Jenny\u2019. After the\neuphoria of that, \u2018Swallow It\u2019, one of\nthe more minor songs from Flamingo\nfeels like a bit too much of a come-down. \u2018Only the Young\u2019 doesn\u2019t quite\nmanage to salvage the drop in mood,\nbefore the Jacques Lu Cont remix of\n\u2018Mr. Brightside\u2019 storms in to wrap up\nthe main set. It takes a few moments\nto recognise the song, but as soon as\neveryone does things go absolutely\nhaywire. There\u2019s nothing quite like it.\nThe encore proves to be special for\ndifferent reasons, as Flowers talks\nabout the influences behind The\nWhat a jacket. And what a face. Photo Credit: Brian Rasic / Redferns\n\"The crowd\nknow every\nword, and\nthis new\nspin on the\nsong goes\ndown just\nas well.\"\n\"Flowers\nstrides\nout in a\nglittery\njacket and\nall hell\nbreaks\nloose.\"\nKillers, and how no-one ever seems to\nacknowledge The Pretenders as one\nof those influences. So he promptly\nintroduces Chrissie Hynde for a\ncover of The Pretenders\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t Get\nMe Wrong\u2019, followed by a duet with\nher on his own \u2018Between Me and You\u2019.\nThere\u2019s another speech, discussing the\ntwelve years that Flowers has been\nperforming on stage, and thanking\nthe person who\u2019s \u201cbeen sharing [him]\nwith [the audiences] for all these\nyears,\u201d his wife, who he eventually\ncoaxes on stage with two of his kids.\nIt\u2019s a cute moment, leading nicely\ninto \u2018Still Want You\u2019.\nThe high of that song then slows,\nslipping into closer \u2018The Way It\u2019s\nAlways Been\u2019. It feels like an odd lull\nto end on, but it\u2019s the way The Desired\nEffect bows out. It makes perfect sense\nfor Flowers to take his leave on the\nsame note.\nHis album, The Desired Effect, is out\nnow.\n\n"

On what exactly, you\nmight ask? Here\u2019s a list of factors\nfor you to consider:\n1) Are you able to walk for long\nperiods of time?\nNavigation is one part of the\nequation. Given the maze like\nlayout you are likely to do a lot of\nwalking back and forth.\n2) Do you have the money?\nA single journey costs \u20ac7, and a\nday pass \u20ac20. Even for a Londoner\nthese prices are pretty steep. If the\nanswer is yes, then no problem for\nyou! But if it\u2019s no, then consider\nfinding accommodation in a\ncentrally located area.\n3) Where is your hotel?\nIf your hotel is central, then\ngetting one ride there and\nwalking the rest of the trip\nmight be a good idea. However,\nthe train station Santa Lucia is\na good 40 minutes\u2019 walk from St\nMarks Square that is the center of\nVenice. This should give you an\nidea of how far you need to walk.\nIt\u2019s also extremely easy to get lost\non your way so make sure you\nknow where your hotel or hostel\nis before you arrive.\nI stayed at a hotel on the top\nright corner of mainland Venice.\nIt was super easy to find but\nalso means I had to do a lot of\nwalking.\n4) Can you navigate?\nThis might sound like a silly\nquestion, but it\u2019s a valid one.\nVenice is maze of a city with\ndozens of canals connected by\nbridges and hidden alleyways that\nlook rather dodgy. It\u2019s virtually\nimpossible not to get lost and\ngetting from point A to B is not as\nsimple as it is in normal cities. On\nmy trip I had to use google map to\nnavigate and to know where I am\n\u2013 this is how hard it is.\n5) How many journeys do you\nplan to make that day?\nIf you are planning to hit a few\nislands on the day, then perhaps\nit\u2019s worth getting the day pass.\nNote, however that you should\ncheck the routes and timetables\non the website as going from\nisland to island might not be an\neasy option.\nWhat did you do? Some of\nyou might ask, and I walked\nthroughout my entire time on\nVenice. Was it tiring? Yes \u2013 but\nyou get to see so much more of\nVenice\u2019s beauty on foot than by\nboat. Not all canals are reachable\nby water bus, and maybe the view\nis different on the water but I\nenjoyed crossing beautiful bridges\nand breezing pass little alleyways.\nSecond of all, the canals are\nnot exactly what you call clean.\nThough regulated by the city to\nmaintain a certain standard, the\nwater is still a green-blue opaque\nthat you do not want to get into\nclose contact with.\nThirdly, I saved a whopping \u20ac80\nby not taking the water bus for\nfour days. There are moments\nwhen I genuinely regretted my\ndecision, for example when I had\nto walk 40 minutes back from St\nMark\u2019s Square to our hotel with\na bursting bladder. So to boat, or\nnot to boat, that is the question\nthat only you can answer.\nWalking over beautiful bridges is one of the best part.

Photos: CivSoc (including opposite)\nFiona Walport reports on CivSoc\u2019s Spring Tour to Bucharest\nOn the 29th\nMarch, 04:00, 70\nCivil Engineers across four\nyears from the Department of\nCivil and Environmental Engineering\ntook off to Bucharest, the capital\nof Romania, for the annual CivSoc\nInternational Tour. The students had\nbeen looking forward to the event\nall year and the excitement amongst\nthose going was felt throughout the\njourney from the Imperial College\nUnion to Bucharest \u2013 even with the\nincredibly early start!\nUpon arriving in Bucharest at\nabout 14:00, CivSoc made their\nway to the X Hostel in the centre of\nthe city on an arranged coach. The\naccommodation was a great, cosy, and\nfun hostel with very affordable prices\nand group discounts. Rooms were of\nvarying sizes, with almost every room\nincluding people from multiple years.\nThis acted as a fantastic opportunity\nto intermix the years and socialise.\nThe hostel also had lots of break\nout spaces and a spacious common\nroom providing students with an\nexcellent opportunity to socialise\nin the mornings and evenings after\nthe eventful days. It also included\nan escape room which proved very\npopular, with one group breaking the\nhostel record. The evening was spent\ngetting accustomed to the area and\nthe Romanian culture, and Professor\nBugnariu kindly came to the hostel to\ngive myself and Dominik [Sznajder,\nCivSoc Chair] a quick overview of the\nplans for the university and site visits.\nThe hostel was well located with\neverything that the students could\nwant in walking distance.\nDay 2\nAfter another early morning\nstart and an improvised breakfast\nprovided by CivSoc, the group\nheaded off in coaches across the city\nto the Technical University of Civil\nEngineering Bucharest. We were\ngreeted by Professor Bugnariu and six\nother members of Bucharest\u2019s Civil\nEngineering Faculty. The content of\nthe morning\u2019s first presentation was\nfocussed around the MetroProject\nthat we were going to see the next day.\nThe first lecturer was a consultant\non the site itself, and was able to\ngive us a detailed summary of the\nhistory of metro lines in Bucharest,\nas well the layout of the current\nproject. Subsequently, Professor\nBugnariu focussed on Bucharest\nOne, specifically the complex\ngeotechnical engineering required\non the site. The main difficulty\nof this project lies in that the two\nbuildings forming Bucharest One\nare constructed above two Metro\nline tunnels. Careful consideration\nmust therefore be taken in designing\nthe pile group beneath the building,\nas well as predicting the settlement\nof the soil that can occur on the\ntunnels. Similarly to the London\nUnderground Ltd requirements, the\ntunnels have a very low allowable\nmovement. The Professor showed us\nthe detailed steps of finite element\nanalysis they undertook in order to\nanalyse/measure the stresses acting\non the tunnels along with the relative\ndisplacements. It was extremely\ninteresting, giving the first and\nsecond years a great appreciation\nof the importance of finite element\nmodelling on real construction sites,\nand providing a practical example\nto the third and fourth years who\nwere more familiar with the use of\nthis type of analysis. Finally, the\nthird presentation, also geotechnics\nfocussed, gave us more insight on how\nthe site investigations were carried\nout. This was also an opportunity\nfor the lecturers to tell us about the\nseismic activity in Bucharest, which\ndirectly related to the University\nwalking tour that followed the\npresentations.\nWe were shown around the\nuniversity campus and then taken\noutside to their \u2018seismic testing\nground\u2019, where the university had\nset up a seismograph to measure the\nseismic activity in the city. We were\ntold that there had in fact been an\nearthquake felt in the city three days\nbefore our visit. The University has\nan educational exchange partnership\nwith a Japanese university that\ncontributes to developing Romanian\nseismic design. This includes building\nsmall scale framed/braced/carbon-reinforced structures to understand\nthe structural capacity offered by\nthese different designs.\nFinally, to finish off this very\ninteresting tour, we were led to the\n\n"

For Chelsea\nmanager Jose Mourinho, it was all he\nreally needed at such a late stage in\nthe season. Opposition teams voiced\ntheir frustrations at Mourinho\u2019s\ntactics but in reality he was doing\na masterful job of marshalling his\ntroops to get them over the finish\nline. Many forget the roaring start\nthey made to the season, which\nallowed them to sit back and defend\nin the latter stages. It may be boring,\nbut my was it effective.\nMike Ashley out of touch?\nIt says something about the ongoing\nsoap opera at St James\u2019 Park that\nthe majority of the neutrals were\nprobably hoping that Hull City\nmanaged to pull off the great escape\nand send the Magpies down to the\nChampionship. Since Alan Pardew\nleft (and let\u2019s be honest, this was a\nclassic example of \u201cbe careful what\nyou wish for\u201d) and John Carver was\nhired Newcastle have lunged from\ndisaster to disaster. This included\na run of eight straight defeats that\ntransformed Newcastle from a\nmid-table club into one teetering\ndangerously close to the relegation\nzone. They have a lot to address over\nthe summer if they want to stay in the\nleague next year.\nShould Brendan Rodgers\nstay?\nCompared to last year, Liverpool\nhad a poor season. They finished\nin sixth place, with an early start\nin prospect next season through a\nEuropa League playoff. Brendan\nRodgers has become the first manager\nin recent times to go through three\nseasons at Liverpool without winning\nany silverware. Last year he was\nscathing about Tottenham, saying\nthat \u201cIf you spend \u00a3100m, you expect\nto be challenging for the league.\u201d This\nseason Liverpool spent \u00a3103m, and\ncame sixth. Rodgers last year also said\n\u201cWe won\u2019t do a Tottenham.\u201d I wonder\nif he was regretting that statement\nwhen the sixth goal went in last week.\nMark Hughes: Hugely\nunderrated?\nFew will forget Mark Hughes\u2019\nhorror spell at Queen\u2019s Park Rangers,\nwhere he was sacked in December\nwithout having won a game in the\nseason. But since then he has taken\nthe job at Stoke City, and has turned\nin some massively impressive results.\nThis season he led Stoke to their\nhighest ever finish - ninth - and\nthey look well placed to make a\nSouthampton style push for Europe\nnext year. If they do it, then surely\npeople won\u2019t be talking about that\nyear at Queen\u2019s Park Rangers any\nmore.\nGarry Monk: Manager of the\nyear?\nFelix\u2019s Team of the Season vs Felix\u2019s Flops of the Season\nForget Jose Mourinho. Forget Nigel\nPearson. Forget Ronald Koeman.\nFor me, the manager of the year\nhas to be Garry Monk. Who could\nhave thought that former club\ncaptain Monk, who was appointed\nlate last season as the Swans avoided\nrelegation, could lead his side to\neighth in his first full season of\nmanagement ever? Certainly not\nme. This was even after he lost\nhis best player in Wilfried Bony\nin the January transfer window\nto Manchester City. He\u2019ll face a\nchallenge to avoid second season\nsyndrome next year, but you wouldn\u2019t\nbet against him. Not after this season.\nCan United mount a title\nchallenge?\nLouis van Gaal achieved his target\nfor this season, which was to return\nto the Champions League. The next\ntarget has to be challenge for the\ntitle, and if he\u2019s going to manage that\nnext year then he has a lot of work\nto do. The first step will be in the\ntransfer market. Van Gaal\u2019s transfer\ndealings from last summer can only\nbe described as mixed. He had great\nsuccess with Ander Herrera, and Luke\nShaw is showing signs of promise.\nHowever the loan move for Radamel\nFalcao, and the purchase of Angel\ndi Maria can\u2019t be ignored. Memphis\nDepay is a good start, but van Gaal\nwill know he has to fix his defence,\nand have a solid replacement for\nwhen his star man Michael Carrick is\ninjured, to mount his challenge. With\nhis track record, you\u2019d expect it.\nKunal Wagle offers his reflections on another thrilling season in the Premier League\nChelsea celebrate their triumph. Photo: Graham Chadwick\nIt\u2019s that time of year again. The\ntime when football reporters\nscour all the statistics from the\nseason to decide who goes in their\nteam of the season. This year, I\u2019ve\ndecided to come up with not only a\nteam of the season, but also a team of\n\u201cflops\u201d of the season.\nIn the team of the season on the left\nI\u2019ve gone with a Chelsea three at the\nback. Some newspapers have come up\nwith four in defence with Gary Cahill,\nbut I felt that that would be covered\nby the defensive midfielder Nemanja\nMatic, who has been instrumental for\nthe Champions. Cesc Fabregas and\nMichael Carrick both missed out on\nthe PFA team of the year, which I felt\nwas harsh. They make up the central\nmidfield. The strikers, Harry Kane\nand Sergio Aguero, pick themselves.\nThe flops was notably harder to\nselect, mainly because of the number\nof strikers who deserved to be in\nthe team. One person I did consider\nincluding was Steven Gerrard, but it\nwould be harsh to say that he didn\u2019t\nhave his moments this season.\n\n"

However the study goes on to\nestimate that only between 26 million\nand 37 million people will actually be\ndiagnosed with diabetes.\nThe study, published in PLOS\nMedicine uses mathematical models\nto estimate the outcome of screening\nthe entire population of the country,\nwhich is about 1.25 billion.

For every\noccasional good one, there is a whole\nhost of bad ones. Pitch Perfect was\none of 2009 most surprising hits,\nmaking back its money in a big\nway and having one of the most\ndownloaded soundtracks of the year.\nWith almost all of the original cast\nback, and Elizabeth Banks taking on\nthe role of director after she produced\nthe first one, does this film manage to\nnot be a disappointment like so many\nsequels are? Well, kinda.\nThe Barden Bellas are back, three\ntime ICCA champions and one of the\nmost respected names in A Cappella.\nAs is to be expected this all goes\nhorribly wrong fairly quickly and\nrather spectacularly at an event\ninvolving suspension from the\nceiling, an American President and a\nlack of underwear.\nThings go from bad to worse for\nthe Bellas, now the laughing stock of\nthe US, are banned from competing\nin the champions and recruiting new\nmembers.\nTheir only hope is win the World\nChampionships, and competition that\nno American team has never won.\nBecause the world hates America.\nNo, I\u2019m not making some crude\ncomment, this is literally a joke from\nthe film.\nElizabeth Banks and John Michael\nHiggins, who were spot on in the first\nfilm as the occasionally inappropriate\ncommentators, take the humour\nway too far in this film, and it just\nbecomes crass rather than amusing.\nIt\u2019s also seen in one of the only two\nnew Bellas that get any screen time.\nYes, she\u2019s from Guatemala, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that literally every word\nout of her mouth needs to be about\nthat fact.\nWhilst there was a great chance\nto expand on the one dimensional\ncharacters from the first film, this\none does just the opposite, making\nthose characters seem even more flat\nand clich\u00e9.\nThe lesbian is the lesbian, the slut is\nthe slut, the Latina is the Latina.\nIt\u2019s just as bad with the new rivals\nin the film, the German team DSM.\nWe meet them time and time again,\nbut their characters never really do\nmuch. They\u2019re the haughty attractive\nforeigners, and that\u2019s all there really\nis to them.\nIt\u2019s not all bad though. Though\nsome of the film feels tired as they\nrepeat popular scenes and scenarios\nfrom the first film, there is enough\nnew content and original jokes that it\nstill gets a lot of laughs.\nRebel Wilson as Fat Amy remains\nthe star of the comedy, lightening\nup the script with her often bizarre\nimprovisation.\nWhat is possibly the best scene in\nthe film involves her, a lake and the\nbest make-out scene in recent cinema.\nNewcomer Hailee Steinfeld playing\nEmily, the only character to really get\nany sort of development, is wonderful\nin her role.\nShe\u2019s the bumbling, awkward,\noverly enthusiastic first year, that\nwe probably all were, and far more\nrelatable that Anna Kendrick\u2019s Beca\nfrom the original film.\nShe\u2019s the heart of the film, and her\ndeveloping romance throughout the\nfilm is just delightful to watch.\nThe romance in general is dealt\nwith well. Many sequels fall into the\ntrap of not really knowing what to do,\nso throw in a bit of romantic tension\nand upset to bring in the audience\ndesperate to see if they make up.\nThis film doesn\u2019t do this, instead\nhaving Beca and Jesse in a happy\nrelationship that gets barely any\nmentions other than a couple kisses\nand conversations.\nIt\u2019s a far better way of doing it,\nand gives more screen time to more\ninteresting things, like the budding\nromances this one has to offer.\nThe soundtrack gives out some\ngreat numbers, but it doesn\u2019t quite\nlive up to the first, and though this\nwas a deliberate choice made by the\ncreators of the film to show how the\nBellas have lost their sound, it\u2019s a bit\nof shame as the stellar soundtrack is\nwhat made Pitch Perfect such a hit.\nOverall, it might not be aca-awesome, but at least it\u2019s not an aca-disappointment.\nI wrote this caption before I found the picture, which is why what I\u2019m writing has no relevance at all to what\nyou\u2019re seeing.

In second place again was the\nUniversity of Oxford, followed by St\nAndrews in third.\nThe Universities of Surrey, Bath,\nDurham, Warwick, Exeter and\nLancaster made up the rest of this\nyear\u2019s top ten.\nThe league table, which ranks\ninstitutions offering undergraduate\ndegrees in the UK, is known to\nplace more weighting on student\nsatisfaction and less on research than\nother similar tables.\nCompared to the rest of the top ten,\nImperial had the lowest score in all\nthree student satisfaction ratings \u2013\noverall course satisfaction, the quality\nof teaching and feedback received.\nHowever in the category \u2018Career\nafter 6 months\u2019, Imperial was awarded\ntop marks. Imperial\u2019s average UCAS\nentry tariff was also amongst the\nhighest on the table, behind only\nOxford and Cambridge.\nBreaking the Guardian\u2019s guide\ndown to individual subjects, Imperial\nwas top in the UK for Mathematics,\nMechanical Engineering (joint with\nLeeds), Civil Engineering and Earth\nSciences.\nImperial were second for Chemical\nEngineering and Materials Science,\nfourth for Electronic and Electrical\nEngineering and fifth for Computer\nSciences. Medicine and Physics\nmanaged eighth place while\nChemistry were tenth.\nFinally, Imperial took the 23rd\nplace\nfor Biosciences, despite achieving\nthird place on The Complete\nUniversity Guide\u2019s version of the\ntables.\nImperial achieved fourth place\noverall on The Complete University\nGuide, gaining two places from the\nprevious year. Cambridge topped\nthe list with Oxford and St Andrews\ntaking the second and third places.\nIn terms of subjects, Imperial\nwere in second place for Computer\nScience, Earth Sciences, Chemical\nEngineering, Civil Engineering,\nElectronic and Electrical Engineering,\nMaterials Sciences and Mechanical\nEngineering.\nImperial were third in the UK for\nPhysics and Mathematics, fourth for\nChemistry and fifth for Medicine.\nThe Complete University Guide\nranking criteria doesn\u2019t put as much\nemphasis on student satisfaction.\nThe Times Good University Guide\nalso placed Imperial fourth overall in\nthe UK, this time behind Cambridge,\nOxford and London School of\nEconomics.\nIn terms of worldwide rankings,\nthis year Imperial was ranked\nninth overall in the Times Higher\nEducation (THE) World University\nRankings, up from tenth last year.\nImperial College was ranked fourth\nin the world for clinical, pre-clinical\nand health subjects and sixth for\nengineering and technology. For\nlife sciences Imperial was tenth and\nphysical sciences twelfth this year.\nImperial also achieved 14th\nplace in\nthe Times Higher Education World\nReputation Rankings, down one place\nfrom 13th\nin the previous year.\nOnly three UK universities made\nthe top 20 on these Times Higher\nEducation rankings \u2013 the Universities\nof Cambridge and Oxford, and\nImperial College London.\nThe World University Rankings are\ndetermined by studying performance\nindicators in five areas: teaching\n(30%), research (30%), citations\n(30%), industry income (2.5%) and\ninternational outlook (7.5%).\nThe Guardian University Guide\nbreaks their scores down into a\ndifferent set of indicators: teaching\n(10%), assessment and feedback\n(10%), overall student satisfaction\n(5%), the student-staff ratio (16.25%),\nexpenditure per student (10%), entry\nscores (16.25%) and career prospects\n(16.25%).\nThe last 16.25% is made up of \u2018value\nadded scores\u2019, which compare the\naverage entry grades of students on\nenrolment to their final awarded\ngrade when they graduate, reflecting\nhow difficult it is to get a good degree.\nData is collected from the\ninstitutions themselves. The UK\nrankings tend to also use information\nfrom the National Student Survey to\ngauge the level of student satisfaction.\nThe National Student Survey takes\nplace annually, assessing the opinions\nof all final year undergraduate\nstudents at institutions in England,\nWales and Northern Ireland.\nCollecting data via questionnaire,\nthe survey covers the quality of\nteaching, resources, assessment\nand feedback; the level of academic\nsupport available; and organisation\nand management at the university.\nThe data are analysed and an\noverall student satisfaction mark\nawarded. Imperial tends to perform\npoorly in comparison with other top\nuniversities in the UK.\nInformation gathered by Times\nHigher Education while compiling\nthe tables has been used to determine\nthat only 28 of the world\u2019s top 201\nuniversities are currently run by\nwomen.\nUnder President Alice Gast,\nImperial College London is among\nthis mere 14% of institutions that\nare female-led.

Blue\nfog shrouded the stage as Hamlet,\nHoratio, and the guards dart across\nthe stage, confronted by the ghost\nof Hamlet\u2019s father. Spine-chilling\nEastern music beats steadily in the\nbackground. The ghost, draped\nin robes befitting of a Japanese\nemperor, weaved in and out of a\nrow of two-storey wooden houses \u2013\nthe permanent set through which\ncharacters dash onto the stage from\nvarious directions.\nHamlet himself, played by\nlong-time Ninagawa boy Tatsuya\nFujiwara, reminded me of an anime\ncharacter or a hero from a Japanese\nsword-fighting drama. With his\ncurly, unkempt hair and black,\nbillowing robes complete with a\nsilver chain around his neck, it is\neasy for us non-Japanese to associate\neverything on stage with what is\nfamiliarly \u2018Japanese\u2019 to us. However,\nit becomes clear that Yukio Ninagawa,\na director known for his take on\nShakespeare, classical Greek tragedy,\nand contemporary productions,\nmeans more than simply to transpose\nEnglish literature to a Japanese\nsetting.\nPerhaps the way the story\nseamlessly fits into a completely\ndifferent setting highlights the\nuniversality of Hamlet\u2019s internal\nstruggle and increasing isolation,\nintensely portrayed by Fujiwara.\nHis anguish was palpable \u2013 even on\nthe many occasions where he was\nalone on stage, his internal turmoil\nexpanded to fill the stage.\nMotoi Hattori\u2019s lighting is\nimpeccable, with the ghost king\nemerging from eerie blue fog,\nClaudius and Gertrude bathed in a\nroyal and almost incriminating red\naura, while Hamlet delivers his \u2018to\nbe or not to be\u2019 speech while walking\nthrough a shaft of piercing white\nlight. Dramatic lighting played a\nhuge role in blowing up appropriately\nintense and dramatic scenes, as well\nas highlighting the turmoil within\nthe conflicted Hamlet and guilty\nClaudius.\nIndeed, there is a grandeur to\nthis production that I rarely see in\ntraditional takes on Shakespeare,\nwhich nowadays tend to be\nminimalist in stage set and prop\nuse. The extravagance of the puppet\nscene, for example, emphasizes the\nelaborate farce that reigns in the\ncourt, where brother sins against\nbrother and then weds his widow.\nPainted actors resembling traditional\nJapanese puppetry enact a carefully\nconstructed script of betrayal,\nbut when Claudius realizes that it\nparallels his own backstabbing of\nhis brother, he storms out in rage\nand guilt. What ensues on stage is\noverwhelming, slow-motion chaos.\nThe collapse of the controlled drama\ninto flashing lights, dramatic music\nand utter pandemonium on stage\nmirrors the breakdown of Claudius\u2019\nimage created upon his brother\u2019s\ndeath, and from this point onwards\nClaudius begins to fear Hamlet and\nfor his tenuous hold on the throne.\nNinagawa is not afraid to go all\nthe way in exposing the characters\u2019\ninner struggles in dramatic visual\nrepresentations \u2013 in the scene\nfollowing the puppet show, Claudius\nis seen dousing himself in a bucket\nof water and then beating himself\nwith a rope, clearly anguished and\ntormented by his fear and guilt. He\nthen quietly prays while Hamlet\napproaches him from behind, all the\nwhile gripping his sword, unsure of\nthe wisdom of killing him there and\nthen.\nPerhaps the most nuanced and\nheart-wrenching performance comes\nfrom Hikari Mitsushima\u2019s Ophelia,\nwho is introduced to us as a gentle girl\ndiscussing with her father Hamlet\u2019s\nperceived advances towards her. Her\ndainty innocence is progressively\ncorrupted in the play as she is first\nviolently treated by Hamlet, who\nscreams at her to go off to a nunnery,\nthen loses her father Polonius when\nHamlet kills him accidentally. She is\nclearly terrified by Hamlet\u2019s change,\nbut it is upon learning of her father\u2019s\ndeath that she descends into a delicate\nmadness. It was almost as if her\ninnocence could not stand up against\nthe farce and cruelty in court, and like\nthe flowers she hands out to the other\nYukio Ninagawa, Hamlet, Shinnosuke Mitsushima and Tatsuya Fujiwara Photo: Takahiro Watanabe\nJingjie Cheng finds that Shakespeare\u2019s language is universal\n\"Ninagawa\u2019s\nunique take\non Hamlet\nexplores\na new\ndimension\nof the story,\nenhancing\nthe play\"\n\"The story\nseamlessly\nfits\ninto the\ncompletely\ndifferent\nJapanese\nsetting\"\ncharacters in her delirium (\u2018rosemary\nis for remembrance\u2019), she is easily\ntrampled upon and swept aside in\nthe midst of betrayal and greed.\nMitsushima\u2019s Ophelia was one of\nthe inadvertent victims of Hamlet\u2019s\nown conflicts \u2013 but her purity and\ndeep, untainted love for her father\nwas perhaps the only redeeming good\nin the dark and twisted halls of the\nDanish court.\nRan Ohtori\u2019s Gertrude, on the\nother hand, was a bland, somewhat\none-dimensional character whose\nown conflicts were not fully explored.\nIt seemed to me that she was a docile\nwoman who willingly followed\nwhoever was in power, without fully\nunderstanding her son\u2019s feelings of\nbetrayal \u2013 a relationship that had\npotential to be fleshed out.\nAs Ninagawa himself mentioned,\nit seems almost \u2018hubris\u2019 to bring\na Japanese adaptation of a classic\nEnglish play back to its country of\norigin. In my opinion, however, his\nunique take on Shakespeare\u2019s longest\nplay explores a dimension of the\nstory which enhances its scope for\nperformance. It is always fascinating\nto observe the versatility of literature,\nand Ninagawa\u2019s Hamlet certainly does\nnot disappoint.\nThe Ninagawa Company\u2019s Hamlet was\non at the Barbican Centre from the 21st\n-24th\nMay. The Ninagawa Company will\nreturn for Kafka on the Shore, 28th\n- 30th\nMay. Tickets available online.\n\n"
