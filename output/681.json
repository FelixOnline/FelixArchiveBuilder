    "content": "ELETTERS\nOUR\nNot so\nsorry state\nDear Sir,\nHugh Stiles ( FELIX, Monday 1 October)\nis to be admired for his concern regarding\ncertain aspects of the state of safety in his\nDepartment. His letter records his opinions\nand regardless of the accuracy and tone of his\nletter's contents we should welcome any open\ndiscourse on matters which affect the safety\nof our places of work. They are, however, his\nopinions and in fairness to those involved as\nwell as for the general appraisal of safety in\nhis Department and the college as a whole,\nmore needs to be said.\nFirst, and of most importance, it is in the\nDepartment's opinion that all of the\nappropriate 'staff in Sherfield' have always\nbehaved in an entirely proper and\nprofessional manner. They have been far\nfrom indolent and indeed without their\nvigorous assistance and monitoring the\nstandard of safety would be greatly reduced.\nThe second and final point of relevance in\nthe appraisal of the letter from High Stiles\nconcerns the nature of the two incidents\ndescribed. In both cases the offending\ncomponents were destroyed and the\nsurrounding evidence available to identify\nthe causes of failure is entirely circumstantial.\nWe have to admit that in cases such as this an\naccurate identification of the reasons loi the\naccident may never be established. There is\nsimply a physical limit to what can be done.\nOn these occasions all the possibilities air\nexplored and a considered appraisal of the\nnew hazard is made followed by the general\nissue of new working procedures for stall and\nstudents who are involved with hazards of\nthis type. This has been carried out for the\nfirst incident and the results are on record. A similar approach is currently being pursued\nfor the most recent case.\nOur safety is a matter of continuing and\nparamount concern and I wish to assure your\nreaders of this. The support and direction\nprovided by the Sherfield staff is a valuable\nand indispensable contribution which\ndeserves to be more widely recognised.\nYours faithfully,\nBrian J Briscoe\nDepartmental Safety Officer\nAnother\nhazard\nDear Sir,\nSince February the main entrance to the\nold Chemistry building (RCS1) has been\nlocked in the evenings and at weekends\n(although it is unlocked during College\nhours). There is a small notice pinned to the\ndoor (initialled by someone called C MW, whoever he is) stating that during the times\nthat the door is locked it can still be used as a fire exit, despite the fact that it cannot be\nopened from the inside without a key. I wonder if the Departmental Superintendent\nwould like to explain how we are supposed to\nget out through this door if the building\nhappens to be on fire.\nYours sincerely,\nHoward Rudd\nChem PG\nFELIX\nIncompetence\nUnforgivable\nTo those of you who are Freshers, this\ninstitution must fill you with a certain sense\nof awe.\nThere are large, glass and concrete\nbuildings towering above us, academics with\nfamous names, rectors with peerages and so\non.\nBut they all have one unity of purpose; they\nare in your service, and without you they\nwould not be here.\nYet there are some parts of the great\ninstitution which manifestly fail in their duty. And the one that has failed most frequently,\nwith most distress to students, and with most\ncrushing im competence, is the Refectory\nService.\nTo confuse beef and lamb is, you may\nthink, forgivable. The first time. But on the\nsecond, third, fourth, fifth time it becomes,\nby God, unforgivable.\nAnd the story doesn't end there. This latest\nerror is symptomatic of a genera! disregard,\nin the Refectories, for the proper service of\nthe students.\nThe responsibility must be laid fairly and\nsquarely at the feet of the Refectory Manager,\nMr Victor Mooney.\nMr Mooney has lost all interest in catering.\nHe divides his time between his extravagant\nyacht in Southampton, and petty in-fighting\nwith members of the College Estates section.\nWhen the College replaces Mi Mooney\nnext year it must find someone oi rare insight\nand skill to right the many wrongs that exist\nin the refectories. We wish them i uck.

    "content": "CFEATURE FEATURED\nTechnology Transfer\nIt has become ac liche to say that the UK is good at inventing\nthings but poor at marketing them. It is a fact nevertheless\nthat the UK lags behind the USA and other countries when it\ncomes to the successful marriage of a technological\npossibility with a market need.\nThe blame for this shortcoming has been laid squarely at\nthe feet of the universities. In Britain they have historically\ndeveloped as places of scholarship and education, although\ntheir research has ranged from the pure pursuit of\nknowledge for its own sake to applied research and\ndevelopment. In an ideal world the fruit of this effort would\nflow through to industry and commerce via technology\ntransfer or the formation of new business or 'spin-off\nventures.\nIn a series of feature articles, FELIX will examine the\nvarious mechanisms for Technology Transfer, see how\nthey affect Imperial College.\nThis week's article looks at the proposed Technology\nTransfer development at the College's field station at\nSilwood Park.\nT he Cuts of81, Keith Joseph's summer\nvacation project that year, were\nrushed, discriminatory, arbitrary to a degree, and badly implemented. But\nfor those universities not damaged beyond\nrepair they have also proved salutary not\nleast in engendering a unity of purpose in\nopposition. Academics and administrators,\nor some of them, have been shaken out of\ntheir lethargic superiority complex and\nbrought nearer to the realities of economic\nrecession. Universities have come to realise,\nunder pressure from the University Grants\nCommittee, that full use must be made of\ncapital and real estate assets, or they should\nbe disposed of \u2014 exploit or liquidate. The\nrules regarding the sale of land or buildings\noriginally purchased with public money have\neven been changed, allowing institutions to\nkeep at least some of the proceeds (witness\nthe recent sale of the Bedford College site in\nRegent's Park).\nThe UGC, in their highly supportive\nstrategy document published in September\nfollowing the '28 Questions' exercise,\nemphasise the need for Universities to seek\nalternative sources of funding, and make\nrecommendations to Government to assist\nthis process. The Committee also says\n\"Universities need to acquire what they now\nlack: a deliberate bias towards change.\"\nImperial College emerged from the\ncarnage with a cut in block grant of 15%,'(the\nnational figure was 17%) some of which was\nmade up with extra overseas students' fees,\nthe rest through early retirements and some\nlong overdue tidying up. The point had been\nmade, however, and a number of Collegelinked commercial schemes were instigated.\nCollege companies were formed (Imperial\nBio-, Software-, and later Polymer\nTechnologies) and industrial lias ion was\nmarkedly stepped up. The concept of an IC\nScience Park was considered. Amongst a number of suggestions which got no further\nthan an Admin file was its possible location\nin a disused chalk pit in darkest Surrey. There\nare now, we are led to believe, other plans for\nthe site.\nean while, down at Westminster, a new\nbuzzword had hit the streets.\n'Technology Transfer\" \u2014 the\ncommercial or industrial exploitation of\ntechnological innovation developed, usually,\nin universities and poly s. Your average\nacademic inventor, it was considered, is more\ninterested in carrying out research than in\nearning money from it \u2014 a typically British\nfailure to capital is e on home-grown ideas.\nThe Government pronounced itself in\nfavour of technology transfer and pledged its\n\u2022support for schemes devoted to this end.\nSome university Science Parks were held up\nas shining examples of just this, but\ninvestigation reveals the older, larger ones, at\nleast (Cambridge, Aston) to have no more\nconnection with their respective universities\nthan a company in which the institution\nhappens to have a shareholding. They are\nlittle more than medium-sized industrial\nestates often sited miles from the university.\n'Technology transfer'there is limited to the\nrecruitment of Prof Smith or Dr Jones to the\nboard of tenant companies in order to lend\nthe latter some credibility. In the Science\nParks' favour, though, is their employment\nof large numbers of graduates and post-docs\nfrom the parent university.\nSo the great minds at IC put themselves\ntogether. What could they do along\nthese lines, only better? Well, big was\nclearly going to be no good. It had better have\nstrong connections with the College on the\nacademic side. It ought to be physically as\nclose to the College as possible.\nWhere could it be built? Two sites sprung\nto mind. Once the new 'Chemistry 2' building\nis complete, another in the space between it\nand Civil Engineering would more or less\ncomplete the Queen's Lawn square. And the\nGovernors had been muttering darkly about\nthe under-use of Silwood Park (\"Very pretty,\nSmith, but what actually happens there?\").\n250 acres of land used by about 300 people at\na net cost to the College of around \u00a33/4ma year didn't sound like efficient use of\nresources. And those awful sheds on South\nGravel could only be improved by\ndemolition.\nWho was going to pay for these\ndevelopments? How about those chaps who\nhelped set up Imperial Biotechnology \u2014\nInvestors in Industry \u2014 the ones with full\npage colour advertisements in The Times?\nWhat should we call them? Not Science\nParks, for a start. What about Technology\nTransfer Centres?\npurpose-built laboratory at Silwood, as a pro top type. The architect is taking special\ncare to integrate the design of the Centre with\nthe existing architecture of Silwood House\nand with the rural nature of the site. As few\ntrees as possible will be cut down, and many\nmore will be planted.\nThere will be a one-storey building\ncomprising a number of small 'seed-bed'\nunits of variable size, where an academic can\nextend his or her research one step from the\npure laboratory stage towards full\ncommercial is ation. He might initially want\nto employ a researcher, say, or a part-time\nsecretary. The management company will\nprovide advice on banking, accounting, law,\netc, and maybe help with contacts in the real\nworld. Central reception, conference and\nsecretarial facilities will be available in the\nbuilding.\nThere will also be six two-storey buildings,\ngrouped in pairs, ranging in floor area from\n4k to 12k sq ft. These will be leased by larger\nR&D companies \u2014 perhaps one of the\nacademic's companies having grown after a few years, perhaps the research group of an\nestablished company. These units will\nprovide a greater sense of identity for tenants,\neach being occupied by just one company.\nFlexibility is the key to the development. If\nan individual in a seed-bed unit wants to\nextent that he needs to employ more people,\nor to have given up altogether. Projects\ninvolving use of the Reactor and Computer\nCentres, or the wind tunnel when it is built,\nwill be regarded particularly favourably.\nThe type of tenant will be strictly\ncontrolled. All must have strong connections\nwith the College, perhaps through their\npersonnel or because they need facilities\nuniquely available at IC. Only low-bulk,\nclean research will be permitted \u2014\nmicroelectronics, software development,\nbiotechnology, etc. There will be no\njuggernauts thundering around the lanes of\nBerkshire. No more than prototype\nproduction for research purposes only will be\nallowed.\nA part from the usual problems of a new\ndevelopment, one barrier will prove\nparticularly difficult to climb \u2014\nSilwood Park is in the Green Belt, which\nforbids almost all new building. In order to\nshow comp at ability with Green Belt Policy\nand to show an overall improvement to the\nsite coupled with some advantage to the\nlocality, the master plan for Silwood Park as\na whole will be revised and submitted along\nwith the planning application. It will include\nprovision for the re siting of the storage and\nother facilities at present on South Gravel,\nthree new academic buildings behind\n3 * r An artist's impression of the proposed de vel p ment at South Gravel, Silwood.\nA nd so it came to pass that plans to\nprove the viability of two TTCs,\norganised under one umbrella\ncompany, got under way. 3i would provide\nthe development, managerial and\norganisational skills, not to mention finding\nthe money; Imperial would contribute the\nland and the all-important academic input \u2014\nboth people and services. 3i and IC would be\nequal partners in the management company,\ndividends from which would provide the\nCollege's income from the project.\nPlans for the Silwood Park Centre are\ncurrently the more advanced, using M Scan,\na mass-spectrometry consultancy housed in a expand his operation, he can move to a larger\nunit within that building or to one of the six\nindividual ones. If a company in one of these\nbuildings wants more space, it can move to\nthe one next door or even have the two joined\ntogether \u2014 they are designed so that a linkway can easily be constructed. Any\norganisation requiring more space than, say,\n20K sq ft is considered too large for the\nCentre and should really be looking for space\nin a different type of development.\nLeases will be of the order of 3 years for the\nseed bed units, longer for the larger buildings.\nAn academic with ideas is likely within 3\nyears either to have developed them to the\nSilwood House, and possibly a new\nSouthwood hostel, together with the\ndemolition of some of the obsolete, wartime\nbuildings. Nobody will lose out, rest assured.\nThe South Kensington TTC will be a prestige block visible from the main entrance\nin Exhibition Road. Its function will be\nsimilar to that at Silwood Park, though the\ndetails have yet to be decided. There will\nprobably be some College-related retail\noutlets on the ground floor \u2014 a bank, the\nICU bookshop perhaps, STA, the union\ntravel agency \u2014 and an underground car\npark. There is a strong possibility that\nSinclair Research Ltd will occupy up to half\nof this building, and that S RL will be\ninvolved in its financing. Sir Clive Sinclair\nalready has links with IC as a Visiting\nProfessor, and will be admitted to the\nFellowship of the College at Commemoration this month. The same management\ncompany will operate this Centre and will\nprovide similar facilities to those at Silwood.\nThe timescale of these projects is largely a matter of conjecture at the moment.

    "content": "Founded 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nMooneyGross error\nSouthside refectory staff admitted on Wednesday that a dish described as Saute of lamb in fact contained beef.\nFELIX was alerted when a Hindu student allergic to beef\nphoned the office anonymously.\nFELIX reporters then went to\nSouthside and ordered a portion\nof 'Saute of Lamb'. The dish was\nserved, and the waitress replied\nthat it was lamb when asked\nrepeatedly.\nThe meal, costing 72 pence,\nwas brought back to the FELIX Office where it was examined and\nfound to contain large cubes of\nstewing steak in a thick beef\nsauce.\nSouthside Refectory Manager\nDavid Smith investigated the\nmatter after enquires from the\nFELIX Office.\n'A member of the kitchen staff\nwas responsible', he said.\n'He removed the wrong dish\nfrom the freezer, and thought\nthat it didn't matter'.\nCollege Refectory ManagerVictor Mooney said how sorry he\nwas and hoped that similar-mistakes would not be made\nagain.\nT 've given instructions for the\nchef to mark the dishes more\nclearly before they are frozen', he\nwent on.\nThis incident follows a FELIX editorial in August this year\nwhich said:\n'...Mr Mooney's staff are\nwrongly describing beef as\nlamb...and so Hindus eating in\nSouthside are likely to have\ncommitted what they would\nregard as a grave sin'.\n'It is intolerable that refectory\nstaff should make such crass\nerrors'.\nMr Mooney, who has been\nincharge of the Refectories since\nthe early 1950s, is to leave the\nCollege soon. His job was\nadvertised in The Times on\nTuesday.\nMr Mooney\nNew Prof\nDennis L Buchanan has been\nappointed to the Mineral\nIndustry Chair of Mining\nGeology at Imperial College,\nUniversity of London, with effect\nfrom 1 October 1984. This chair\nhas been funded through BP\nMinerals International Ltd, Consolidated Gold Fields PLC and Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation\nwith support from Charter\nConsolidated and Anglo American Corporation.\nProfessor Buchanan graduated from Rhodes University in\n1969, then worked for Union\nCorporation before he gained his\nPhD at Imperial College on\naspects of the Bushveld Complex. He has particular\nexpertise in the economic\ngeology of sulphide deposits\nassociated with basic complexes\nand was Specialist Adviser to the\nHouse of Lords Select\nCommittee study on Strategic\nMinerials.\nSouthside\nflooded\nSouthside residents may have\npipes caused severe flooding\nResidents first noticed water\ncoming into rooms on Staircases\nfive and eight, level three, on\nWednesday night at 6.00pm. On\nThursday morning at 8.25am more severe flooding occurred\nmainly in four Falmouth/Keogh\nrooms, Selkirk gallery level, the\nHousekeeper's Office and Tizard\nkitchen.\nDirty water flowed into the\nrooms through pipes running\nalong wardrobes. Residents\nreported ruined clothing and hi-fi\nequipment.\nIn one room water began to\nflow through the electric light\nfittings, fusing the system.\nElectricians from Estates were\ncalled to the scene to turn off\nlighting current, and begin the\njob of drying out fuse-boxes and\nconduits.\nto be evacuated after leaking\nyesterday morning.\nConsultants D SSR, who\ndesigned the system, were\nquickly on the scene to assess\ndamage and ascertain the cause\nof the flood.\nThe flooding occurred when\nSouthside's newly installed\ncentral heating system was filled\nwith water. The contractors,\nMort Scott, had failed to cap off\npipes to the old system.\nKate MacPherson housekeeper in Selkirk, whose own\noffice was badly affected, said\nthat the long term problem\nwould be the stench from the\nflooded rooms when they dried\nout.\nDamage to personal property,\ncarpets and paintwork has been\nput at many thousands of\npounds.\nMore false alarms\nFire precautions in College have once again been shown to\nbe at fault. The problems with the new Southside fire alarm\nsystem have still not been resolved with three false alarms\nthis week following the inconvenience and disruption caused\nlast term when the alarm continually went off, often in the\nmiddle of the night.\nLast year fire alarm system was\ninstalled in the Southside Halls of\nResidence. From the start it\nproved to be unreliable with the\nalarms going off regularly. As a result the alarm became useless\nsince it we as soon ignored by\nresidents. FACE, the consulting\ncompany concerned with the\ninstallation, visited the College\non several occasions during the\nsummer. However, false alarms\nduring the summer and on\nTuesday this week showed that\nthe problem had still not been\nsolved completely. FalmouthKeogh Hall warden Paul Jowitt\nsaid that already new residents\nwere getting into the dangerous\nhabit of ignoring false alarms are\nthe result of some fundamental\nflaws in the design of the system.\nSmoke detectors, for example,\nwere installed in positions where\nthey were likely to detect smoke\nfrom harmless sources such as\ncookers and cigarettes. These are\nnow being replaced with heat\nsensors which will hopefully only\nbe trig erred in real emergencies.\ncontinued on back page\nFree! Friday 5 October 1984 No 681\n\n"

In this welcoming address, the\nRector urged Freshers to work\nhard but at the same time to\nparticipate in Union activities.\n'Few things can be less\ndemocratic', he said, 'than the\napathy that leads you to leave\nyour opinion unregistered, and\nallows others to exploit you'.\nHe went on to ask for\nconsideration for those living\nnear to the College, refer ing in\nparticular to the level of noise.\nIn a departure from his\nprepared text, the Rector joked\nThe Rector\nabout the problems with the new\ntelephone systems reported in\nMonday's FELIX.

Over the summer\nthe doors on the external fire exit\nfrom the Southside lower gallery\nlevel failed to open. A group of\nAmerican tourists who were\nresponding to a false al aram found that the doors, which\nshould be released when the\nalarm sounds, were still locked.\nAt the time of going to press Mr\nFoggon, the College Fire Officer,\nwas still checking this incident.\nInternal fire doors in Linstead\nHall are also incorrectly\ndesigned. Fire doors on the upper\ngallery level can only open\nthrough 90\u00b0 rather than the 180\u00b0\nrequired by law.\nAs present work is being\n\u2022carried out on the halls, aimed at\nupgrading the fire alarm and\nescape systems to the level\nrequired to obtain a fire\ncertificated.

In\nadd it on, the meeting was\naddressed by Delyth Morgan,\nPresident of the University of\nLondon Union, and heard\nreports from the President and\nother Union Officers.\nThe motion on London\nTransport noted the recent\nchange in control of LT and that\nfare increases are expected. Any\nfuture fare rises will affect\nstudents more severely than past\nincreases because daily travelling\nexpenses can no longer be reclaimed from Local Education\nauthorities. The motion pledged\nthe Union's support to 'Capital',\na new pressure group campaigning against fare\nincreases.\nThe Returning Officer, Hon\nSecretary Eric Darbyshire, gave\ndetails of forthcoming elections.\nThe most important of them is\nfor the Rag Chairman, who is a Union Officer and member of\nCouncil.

In addition, elections are to be\nheld in the Aeronautics, Mineral\nResources Engineering and\nManagement Science departments for departmental representatives. Reps in other\ndepartments were elected last\nsession.\nAt the end of the meeting a motion called 'Freedom Motion\n1984' was proposed. This motion\nwas also put forward at each of\nthe Constituent College Union\nmeetings on Mondays, at all\nthree of which it was defeated or\nnot heard. The motion was\nwritten by Michael Newman,\nwho took up much time at UG Ms last year with his anti-porn\ncomp a ign. Mr Newman is no\nlonger a student, having failed his\nexams, and the motion was\nproposed by John Martins.\nBefore Mr Martins could speak\nto the motion, however, a procedural motion that the\nquestion be not put was proposed\nby Hugh Stiles. Mr Stiles\nattacked the proposer s of the\nmotion for wasting time at\nUG Ms with irrelevant motions\nall last year, and said that such'\nmotions should not be debated.\nThe procedural motion was\npassed on the vote, and the\nmeeting closed with all business\ncomplete shortly after 2.00pm.
