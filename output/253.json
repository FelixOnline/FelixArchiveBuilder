This was the first I.C. win over King's for five years and it's true merit is shown by the fact that King's are\nunbeaten in league matches this season.\nI.C. began unsteadily, gradually took control and finally over an the opposition. The game was won in midfield where Wallace, making\nfull use of the space given him, created panic in the King's defence\nwith telling passes. After 20 minutes, Keer's centre from the left was\ncleared to Squire, who calmly lobbed it over the goalkeeper only to see\nit palmed away by a defender. Wallace made no mistake from the\nspot.\nThe second half continued with the I.C. defence winning every\nloose ball, their efforts being soon rewarded when in a move involving\nsix players, Keer beat three men before crossing for O 'Donnell to slot\nthe ball home. i The third goal followed when Squire intercepted a loose clearance\nand sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from just inside the area.\nThis was a memorable victory based on good teamwork and spirit\nand a similar performance in the next round should see I.C. in the\nsemi-final.\n\\ RICK DAVIES\nKings goalkeeper admiring the scenery\nHockey Club Fortnight Ist XI\nSaturday, 25th November\nv.

Ashford IV (away), won 1-0.\nSaturday, 2nd December\nv. N. P.L. IV (home), lost 0-1.\nThe club on a whole this term\nhas not been winning many\nmatches, but on the other hand\nneither has it suffered the resounding crashes it has endured\nin previous years.\nThe 2nd XI is showing tremendous promise, the side settled\ndown quickly and despite the\nusual changeover in players due\nto movements in the 1st XI and\nm avoidable absenteeism. The side\nhas won 3, lost 3 and drawn 1\nand if the improvements in team\nplay especially by the forwards\ncontinue, the side can look forward to better results in the\nfuture.\nThe 3rd and 4th XI's are even\nmore strongly hit by the movements of players in the ist and\n2nd XFs and they have both\nmanaged to produce records\nbetter than those for this\ntime last year. So the 3rd XI can look forward to a bright\nfuture and if there is the demand\nby members of the club for the\n4th XI to continue in the next\nterm, they too can look forward\nto a good season.\nThe 2nd XI in their cup match\noverwhelmed King's4 th XI as\nwas expected by a margin of 7-1,\nBrian Hall got three goals to add\nto the incredible number he is\nbuilding up this season for his position as wing half.\nIC WSC Draws for Ladies Hockey? On December 2nd, the ladies of\nICWA played at New Cross\nagainst Goldsmith's in the 2nd round of the U.L. U. Knock-out\nTournament. ICWA opened the\nscoring with a good goal, but\nGoldsmith's rapidly retaliated\nwith an equally good one. Two\nmore goals came in quick s uc cession, and the half-time score\nstood at 2 all. At the beginning of\nthe second half, an immediate\nbreakaway by Goldsmith's from\nthe bully resulted in a goal, giving them the lead. Although IC\nattacked consistently throughout\nthe second half, they were not\nrewarded with a goal until two\nminutes before the end of the\ngame, ft being too dark to play\nextra time, it was decided to have\na replay the following Wednesday.\nGoldsmith's duly arrived at\nHarlington on Wednesday, 6th December and battle commenced\nagain. The match was very even,\nwith many attacks by both sides,\nand excellent work by both de fen ces. The half-time score was 1\nall, and although both sides\nfought keenly, no addition was\nmade to the score. Only 10 mins.\nof extra time could be played\nbecause of failing light and it was\ndecided to count corners. Lo and\nbehold, both sides had scored 2\nshort corners and 1 long.\nThe re-replay will be held on\nWednesday, 17th January at\nGoldsmith's and lots of support\nwould be appreciated, so that we\nget a conclusive result.\nNETBALL\nI.C.15 \u2014 Chelsea 12\nThe match started late with\nI.C. under strength in the attack\nwithout their regular goal shooter.\nI.C. was playing the better game\ntactically from the first centre-pass; marking fairly well, and\npassing tightly, and in spite of\npraiseworthy efforts by the\nshooters, the half-time score was\n6-5 to Chelsea.\nThe second half saw some close\nmarking and faster play by I.C. The superbly co-ordinated defence kept play within Chelsea's half, enabling I.C. to gain a lead\nwhich they then never lost.\nThanks are given to Weeks\nHall for their support.\nCROSS COUNTRY I CARE UL CHAMPIONS IC won the University Championships in blizzard conditions\nat Parliament Hill Fields on\nSaturday,finishing well ahead of\ntheir rivals UC.

Where else for M)/ double can you get The Action,\nSavoy Brown Blues Band, 1984, Cat Ballou, The People, 2 meals (?),\ncoffee, punch, folk, jazz ?\nBut to get to specifics : The Action were not at their best in the\nfirst session but were much improved in the second; The Savoy\nBrown's were good without being outstanding, 1984 were, well, 1984.\nA stroke of genius put the film in the lower refectory permanently\nand had three showings, thus avoiding disruption caused by furniture\nmoving and the big squeeze at one showing. The choice of film\u2014\n\" Cat Ballou \"\u2014was an excellent one, satisfying both those who had\nseen it before and those who had not.\nCabaret\nThe cabaret was good in places,\nembarrassing for some in others.\nThis was the first time a completely professional cabaret had\nbeen used at an RCS Carnival for\nsome years, and by comparison\nwith last year's was well worth\nthe expense. Entitled \" The\nPeople Show \" it consisted of a series of sometimes hilarious\nsometimes disturbing sketches involving three men and a woman\non the theme of motherhood, deflating some of the more fatuous\ninterject or s on the way.\nSurprise Guest\nAn un publicised performer\nwas Gary Farr, who, since leaving the T Bones, has been songwriting and folk singing. He\nsang for about twenty minutes\nCoffee was continuously available in the upper refectory, and\nfolk and jazz on tap in the Senior\nCommon Room. The only\ntrouble with the potent punch was\nthat it ran out before most people\neven knew of its existence.\nFood Fiasco\nThe one real criticism which\ncan be levelled against it\u2014and\nthat is hardly the fault of RCS\nEnts\u2014was the food. After one\nhad stood and been pushed\naround by the animals waiting for\ntheir feed, whilst numerous fed\nspecimens squeezed themselves\nthrough the hungry masses,\nThe Carnival only made a small loss of about \u00a330, due\nmainly to RCS Ents Chairman.\n\" Spooks\" Duckett's economy\nmeasures.\nBut let us not carp on this\npoint; it was truly a Carnival\nwhich lived up to Carnival ex-pec tat ions.

From\nthe material he has collected the\naverage monster appears to be\n40 ft in length with are p till ian head, a serpentine neck 8 ft long,\na massive body and a long tail\npresumably used for steering\u2014\u2022\nwhether they have flippers or feet\nhas not been established.

Od. per fort-night.\nju uvb BRAIN DRAIN Last Thursday's Union debate,\n\"that this house would join the\nbrain drain,\" provided lunchtime\nentertainment for the large audi-en ce, but one would have expected a much more serious and\nuseful discussion in Imperial College. There was much fine\nrhetoric but little else.\nRestrained Attac lcs Professor Anderson, of the\nElectrical Engineering depart-ment, in proposing the motion,\nmade the usual points about the\ngrass being greener on the Other\nside, and then gave a case history (from his own experience)\nof lost opportunities, in thin film\ntransistors. Dr. Jeremy Bray,\nMP, began with remarks about\nviable and sensible micro ele c tronic projects and then went on\nto give a fine Wilson it e speech to\nthe effect that British industry\nneeds reorganising into larger\nunits and that this was being\ndone, but takes a little time. One\nfelt that Professor Anderson\ncould have been a lot more\ndamning of the Ministry of Technology and that, in turn, he was\nlucky to get off so lightly at the\nhands of a professional politician.\nGreen Paint In seconding- the motion,\nDavid Robert, a PG from Australia, seemed mainly concerned\nwith pointing out the advantages of Australia. Malcolm\nDuckett's main contribution to\nthe opposition was that the grass\nwas only painted -green on the\nother side.\nThe voting was 93 for emigration and 42 against. The debate\nwas academic in more sense than\none, however, as only that morning we had heard news of the\ndrastic new American immigration law.\nLITSOC\nFAIRIES\nThe Literary Society held its\nthird meeting of the term in the\nreading room of the Union building last Monday, December 4th. on \" Fairytales, Legends and\nMyths.\" The speakers were five\nI.C. fairies; Mike Edwards, Maia\nWallis (\n\"\nwho popped in from\nIcwaland and then tro poe d out to\nsing jazz l. Mike Mansfield, J.P. Connerade and Chris Eriksson.\nMike Edwards opened the discussion with the Arthusian le-g end. He recalled the excellent\nreason for the existence of King\nArthur and the Round Table, the\ncommitting of chivalrous acts,\nsuch as rescuing fair maidens in\ndistress. (Tcwarians are not recommended to wave hand kerch i eyes out of Beit Hall windows as\nM.R.E. is de velo nme chivalrous\ncharacteristics). Perhaps omi-nous ly, he told the society that\nKing Arthur will come again,\naccording to legend.\nMaria Wallis introduced the\nsociety to the Greek horses, who\nsupported both sides in a battle\n(after all they had not T.V. then),\nand who came down to earth when\nthey felt like pleasure. She told us\nthat the Greeks separated their\nreligion from their mythology.\nPerhaps that is something else\nour science-worshipping society\ncan learn from the Greeks.\nMansfield Lord\nGnome ?\nThe discussion continued with\na convincing Mike Mansfield tel-ling, the society of the life with\nelves and gnomes behind leaves.\nThe meeting was also informed\nthat fairies are not people but the\nplace where fairies live; (can we\nbe assured that this important\npiece of information will be\npassed on to the Rector for academic dissemination, and to the\nstudents at the next Union meet-ing?) He end ad by informing the\nmeeting that f JIM PCS were not\nreally nasty people since they always come to the rescue in the\nend!\nSpeaking next was Chris Erikson on Old English and Norse\nGods. He passionately recalled\nthe English and Scandinavian\nGods of war, Thor, Frig, Balder\netc, and the story of the Bleeding\nGod. The society was informed\nfrom the Niblungenlied of King\nGunther was beaten up by\nhis disinterested wife Brunhilde\non the wedding night and suspended by his pyjamas on a wall\nnail; (anybody with a similar experience please see Doc. Grey).\nSadism\nThe discussion ended with J.P. Connerade, in typically excellent\nform, recalling Grilles de Paris'\nadventures with sadism in his\ncastles, and how this developed\ninto the myth of Bluebeard.\nDiscounting the absence of\nHans Christian Anderson and the\nArabian Nights, the meeting\nproved successful.\nSOUTHSIDE IN PLACE This article will be of great\ninterest to those who find difficulty in getting down to work.\nThe Southside Halls' lifts are\nnoted for their tendency to oscillate when the passengers jump\naround inside. In addition they\nare liable to stop and not restart\nif this exercise is overdone.\nAbout a week ago, two residents of Tizard Hall discovered\nthis phenomenon and decided that\nthe lift was the ideal place for\ndoing problem sheets. They made\none mistake: they rang the alarm\nbell and were rescued wi h in half\nan hour.\nThis method of \" getting away\nfrom it all\" is still in the early\nstages of development. Next time,\nthey intend to take along thermos\nflasks and borrow some hall\ncushions. The legal aspect of\nthis exercise is not clear. Does\nbeing stuck all night in a lift with\na non-resident constitute introducing an overnight guest?\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE SURVEYS ITS PAST STUDENTS\nThe feedback of comment from past students of I.C. forms a significant contribution\nto review of academic courses and standards, so the college is circulating a questionnaire\nto past undergrads and post grads of the years 1925-62+-.\nThe survey embraces British students wherever they now live and Overseas students\nstill in the country, but despite extensive checks on addresses, the college has 'lost1 many students and these are invited to contact Professor E.M. Goodger in Elect rio al Engineeriug. (Tel. 01-539-5111 Ext.465). The college hopes for a good response, as this\ndetermines the whole value of the operation, and also hopes that the preliminary report\nwill appear by Summer I968.\nTHEME COMPETITION - Won by Roger Guy Civil Engineering 3 . Guilds Mines Carnival will release the theme next term.\nCOST OF PURPLE REDUCED\nIt appears that by means of an all night filtering operation, the bill for throwing\npotassium permanganate into the Marshall Street swimming baths before the swimming gala\nwas only \u00a36 - this is a great relief as if the pool had had to be emptied and cleaned the\ncost to ICU would have been in excess of \u00a380, It has not yet been discovered who\nactually threw the chemical into the pool,\nUNION MEETINGYesterday's Union Meeting v/a3 a classic for those connoisseurs of constitution\njuggling and general stirring. The last Union Meeting of October 19th was re-opened, obviously short of a quorum\nby about 100. After various people had been persuaded not to challenge the quorum Dr.\nWeale, the Union Senior Treasurer, presented that accounts for the previous year and\nexplained the items on it lucidly. The most important points were that expenditure had\nrisen by \u00a31,600 to \u00a318,264 whilst income had fallen, although subscriptions were up by\n\u00a3750. There was a negative balance of \u00a32,497 on the year. After selling nearly \u00a31,700\nworth of investments there was an ett deficit of \u00a31,100, which it is hoped will be\nrefunded by the college, which has given the Union 17/6 per head. He finished with his\nperennial excuse that the Union fee was not big enough.\nIn 'Any Other Buisness1\nPresident Phillips informed the meeting of a collection for Charlie Parsons, to buy a plaque in the Union Dining Hall, the remainder to be given to\nhis widow, and Howard Cheshire, head Union barman for many years, for a gift; reports of SCG, RCC, AGO and Executive minutes are to be published in Southside and in the Union;\nand he is negotiating a fee with the college for Union membership for 'disguised students*\nwho are registered as inter al students of London University but are not eligible to belong\nto the Union at present.\nIn Question Time the rumour that no foreign students will be allowed in Linstead\nHall was dispelled. The anonymous donor stipulated that no more than 20$ overseas\nstudents should live in it, compared with a 'norm' at the present time of 15$\u2022\nRory Redmayne asked why no agenda was posted, to which Dave Harris replied that it; was an experiment to try to attract more people, despite the fact that it stipulates\nthat it should be done in the Union Blue Book,\nRex Lowin gave an account of the activities of the Welfare Committee, The grants\nsurvey so far lias a66$ reply from undergraduates and 25$ from postgraduates. The results\nshould be out at the beginning of next term. They are also looking into the possibility of opening a nursery for married students with children and he asked for names of anyone\nwho would be able to use the service, particularly undergraduates, to contact him, A coffee bar in Southside, a West London Colleges accommodation bureau, student houses and\nappeals to the Rents Tribunal are the other matters being looked into by this Committee.\nThe first meeting was now closed and another one opened amongst a lot of argument\nand passed straight onto the issue of parking.\nTwo motions were put forward, one deploring the charge f01* parking and asking for a referendum throughout the college, the other deploring the charges, the Rectorfc*\ndecision to reconstitute the parking committee and the: method of selection of those\nallowed to park. Rory Redmayne, retiring editor of FELIX opposed both of these, but\nbefore votes could be taken Stewart Barnes tried to put everyone out of their misery by\nchallenging the quorum; the number of people present by this time had fallen to about\neighty. However, this was a 'vain hope since it was decided to vote on the motions as an\nunofficial group of students,. Both were passed, the second in separate parts.\n\n"

I must get it off my\nchest\u2014it all seems so pathetic,\nbut; well \u2014 it happened like\nthis . . .\n. . . it was the night of December the first\u2014-you remember?\nThe Friday of the RCS carnival.\nIt seemed funny they should arrange the swimming gala on the\nsame evening; but then the\nwhole thing had been a bit disorganised anyway.\nAbout 80 of us went. They\nlaid on coaches which left from\nthe union at 6.30, or there-about s. We went to the Marshall\nStreet baths\u2014we've been there\nbefore and I think they're the\nonly ones in London that'll let\nIC in.\nIt's a nice pool, doctor. When\nwe'd all sat down the swimmers\njumped in to practice\u2014you see\nIC's made up of three colleges\nand the galas meant to be the\n'yearly swimming competition.\nWe enjoy it usually, because we\ncan't resist the opportunity to\npush our college committee into\nthe water\u2014they all dress up for\nthis; and so that makes it even\nmore fun.\nIt was just after 7.30 that they\npushed Dick James in (he's the\nVice-President of our college).\nThen some one at the back of the\nGuilds stand threw a sort of\nwhite packet into the water. I didn't know what it was ; but no\none seemed very bothered so 1\nignored it. Anyway, about ten\nminutes later the water suddenly\nturned purple\u2014must have been\nthat packet, I suppose\u2014perhaps\nit held potassium permanganate.\nSoon after that the manager told\nus to leave. It was a pity, really;\nit looked as if the gala might\nhave been fun.\nEach of the colleges went off\nfor a drink \u2014\u2022 we all went to\ndifferent pubs, of course. It\nwasn't the same, though. I had\nbeen looking forward to the gala\ntoo.\nYou see, doctor, it is rather\npathetic, isn't it ?\nTHE YOUNG TRADITION\n\" Like having a bath with your\nsocks on.\" This was how Royston\ndescribed singing through a microphone. The Tradition\u2014\nRoyston, Peter and Heather\u2014\ngave a polished performance of\nunaccompanied singing. Their\nsongs are collected from varied\nsources\u2014many of them from\nHarry Cox, and the Copper family\nof Sussex. During their first set, they sang sea shanties and other\nsongs, and on their re-appearance\ngave their excellent rendering of\nthe \"Lyke Wake Dirge,\" amongst\nothers.\nSince their visit to the Folk\nClub last year, they have made\ntwo LPs, and have appeared at\nthe Albert Hall and the Cambridge folk festival ; wc hope to\nsee them again before t qo long.\nAnother guest was Gary Farr,\n(formerly of the \" T Bones\"), and\na friend Kevin. Farr was disappointing : he is technically able,\nand obviously sincere, but perhaps he has yet to find the style\nthat suits him. He also played\nat the RCS Carnival on Friday.\nThere is a wealth of players\nwithin the Folk Club, and they,\nas always, supported the guests.\nGuilds\nPunch up\nOn Friday night a section of\nthe Guilds party collecting for\nCarnival became involved in a fight in Leicester Square. The\ntrouble started about 11.20 after\nBO had tun out of petrol, when\nsome of an approximately fifteen-strong gang of drunks tried to\nclimb on to BO and started to\nbend the head lamp. Although there were about\nfifty Guildsmen present, they\nseemed to come off worst, at least\neight of them getting hit, including Guilds President Chris\nODonnell and secretary Paul\nBradley, another lost his watch.\nAll the attackers got away, and\nit is thought that only three of\nthem can bear any mementoes of\ntheir evening.\nIt is believed that no Carnival\nmoney was lost, but this is not\ncertain as the tins were not\ncounted when they were given\nout. The proceeds of the evening were \u00a3111. The damage to\nBO, if any, was very slight.\nM ines\nMeeting\nA Royal School of Mines\nUnion meeting was held in the\nMining Lecture Theatre on Tues.\n5th December. Mr. Ian Wells\npresided over the meeting as well\nas a funny yellow lion and a certain piece of engineering equipment now painted yellow and\nblack. Claimants for the yellow\nlion to Mines Union office, also\nfor the Guild's Spanner! Reports\nfrom the Minesman who went to\nDelft and Trondheim were heard.\nPhil Hopwood urged support for\nthe charity collecting sessions and\nsaid that Mines could collect\n\u00a31,000 for this year, as opposed\nto last year's \u00a3400. A motion\nfor women students to have representation on the commit ee was\nconsidered to be a constitutional\nchange and so could not be voted\non, as no advance notice had been\ngiven. A vote was taken on where\nto hold the next Mines night,\nskating being favoured over the\ndogs and Battersea Fun Fair. Mr.\nIan Wells asked for support for\nthe foreign students week and reminded Mines women that partners were needed for the foreign\nstudents at the Mines Ball. The\nmeeting ended at 2.35 p.m. with\nCats.\nRuhemann Resignation Rejected\nAt the last S. C.C. meeting, a letter was received from Soc. Soc.\nclaiming that the lack of Union\nmeetings held this term was\nrestricting the activities of the\nClubs. They suggested that S. C.C. should press for more meetings\nin future. Chairman, Pete Ruhemann, declared that in his opinion,\nthis was not S. C.C.'s business,\nand it was beyond his scope to do\nso. The ensuing discussion culminated in five other clubs agreeing\nwith Soc. Soc. and a motion being\ncarried instructing the Chairman\nto press for more meetings. The\nChairman immediately offered his\nresignation, still claiming that it\nwas beyond his scope. After a a tremendous vote of confidence\nhad been passed, he withdrew his\nresignation.

In each refectory about 50 people\nwere asked the following three questions:\n1. Do you enjoy a Mooney meal!\nAnswers : (in percentages)\nUnion Snack Bar\nSouthside Snack Bar\nUpper Union\nLower Southside\nUpper Southside\nLower Union\n2.

Considering the difficulties involved, are you satisfied with\ncatering at I.C.I Answers :\nUnion Snack Bar\nSouthside Snack Bar\nUpper Union\nLower Southside\nUpper Southside\nLower Union\nDirty Cutlery and Excessive Queues?\nA surprisingly large number of people were, in fact, satisfied\nwith the food and the price but it must be remembered that this is\nan analysis of people who are using the facilities. Interviewees were\nalso asked for any brief comments. By far the most common complaint was about the excessive queues, although one FELIX reporter\ndid comment that people were being served quicker than he could\ninterview them. A lot of people said the cutlery was dirty. Surprising\nis the difference in the numbers of people in the two snack bars who\nenjoyed their meal. The figure for the number of people who only\nsometimes enjoy the food in S. S. snack bar is high; surely the quality\nand variety is constant in the snack bars. A few people in both Southside refectories commented that the food ran out long before refectories close and that in both these places, it is not possible to get tea.\nOne person claimed that in the snack bars, ham sandwiches cost more\nthan from British Rail. Many people indicated that the choice of\nfood was too restricted.\nThere was one isolated comment of praise; the remainder were\ncomplaints, and most were not trivial. Among the constructive criticism was a common complaint that there are no eating facilities\navailable other than during limited hours and a suggestion that a snack\nbar should be open during daytime and evenings was made by several\npeople.\nWho is Mooney ?\nA number ot people had never heard of Mooney\u2014dare I suggest\nthat these were not from college, or is it possible for a fresher to have\nexisted a term without having come across this expression?\nOne person complained of being disturbed by FELIX reporters\nand another said Mooney more than twice a week upset his stomach.\nOne person seriously refused to answer the three questions.\nMOONEY TELLS\nALL Mr. Victor Mooney has been I.C.'s catering manager since he\ntook up the job at the age of 30\u2014\" for my sins.\" This truly Herculean task was the culmination of a long post-war career in hotels and\nkitchens up and down Britain. During the war he served in the Navy.\nHe still sails for pleasure in his spare time ; a large navigational map\nof the Solent hangs in his office. He answered the varied criticisms\nof his catering, put to him by FELIX, with a direct and keen desire\nto get the facts straight\n\"Cutlery is too dirty **...**do you call this lamb's muscle or\nlamb's chop?\" . . . \" can we have more variety, please?\" . . . \" When\ndid the last Mooney meal disappear down the last Mooney gullet?\"\n. . . these are just a few quotes from the gastronomic graffiti of the\nrefectories complaint book.\nMr. Mooney answered the main serious criticisms point by point\nbeginning with complaints about slow queues. Part of the reason for\nthis, is that new students take some time to settle down to the\nsystem and hence slow up the queues in the winter term. A lot of\ntime is wasted by people hesitating when faced with a choice between\none succulent dish and another. The situation is not improved by the\nfact that most people come for these meals during the peak periods.\nTwo cashiers per exit had been tried in most overloaded refectories\nto cope with this, but was not found to be really effective.\nNext \u2014 dirty cude ry? Mr. what appears to be dirt on cutlery\nin fact commented that Mooney\nfood is far superior to that produced by refectories at such\nplaces as Manchester University,\nWarwick University (\" atrocious\n. . . abominable\"), and University\nCollege. If a meal seems particularly bad, it can always be ex-changed. Mr. Mooney did however promise to look into complaints of dry carrots and poor\nchips. He also felt that complaints\nof little variety were not really\njustified. If people come along\njust as refectories are closing,\nobviously there will be little\nchoice; but in general all the items\nadvertised on the menu (and\nthere are quite a few) will be\navailable.\nMr. Mooney admitted that the\nsalmonella scare which hit Manchester University earlier this\nterm\u2014fifty people were taken ill\nwith food poisoning\u2014worried\nhim, as it must any large catering\nestablishment. There is always\na risk of infection, and it is almost impossible to remove it in\nlarge hard-worked kitchens.\nOn the matter of increase of\nprices ,it seems that this was\nplanned to net a surplus of\n\u00a313,000 this session. Whether\nthis will in fact come to pass is\n\" in the lap of the gods \"\u2014and\nperhaps also, the Exchequer.\nSince the refectory calculations\nwere first mooted, the' price of\nmeat, for example, has risen by\nsome 10 per cent, due to deval u a tion. The refectories are supposed to break even in the long\nrun, but if this cost escalation\ncontinues then prices may have\nto rise again to cope. As the\nFELIX survey confirms, most of\nI.C. considers Moaney meats to\nbe value for money\u2014at present.\nThe Chip\nProblem\nMooney is concerned about this\ncomplaint and is thinking of\nchanging dish-washers to improve\nthe situation. One of the chief\nproblems, however, is that the\nwater in the London area is\n\"hard.\" Because of this, much of\nis in fact deposited scale.\nThe food is badly cooked? \" I don't accept that,\" said Mr.\nMooney, \" We are continually\nbeing complimented on the standard of our food by external\ncustomers.\" Several people have\nA final word on t ne vexed\nquestion of the Mooney chip.\n\" Chips are very difficult to do,'*\"\nsaid Mr. Mooney. \" Even Lyons\nhaven't really cracked the problem yet. . . \" And, oh boy, what\na problem!\nEIGHT TONS\nCD F SPUDS\nIC is noted as a college keen\non the facts and figures of the\nsituation. Herewith some of the\nmore interesting details concerning Mooney's emporia: \u2014\nIn just one day the refectories\nuse:\n200 lbs. of peas\n100 lbs. of b^ ans\n100 lbs. of carrots\n200 lbs. of cabbage.\nWhen meat pie is on the menu\nin Southside lower refectory,\n150 lbs. of mincemeat are used\nat one sitting.\nEight tons of potatoes are\nneeded each week, making a total\nof about 280 tons used in a ses-sion. Most of these potatoes are\nconverted into the notorious\n\" Mooney chips.\" If all these\nchips, eaten each year, were laid\nend to end, they would stretch a distance of about 700 miles, i.e.6,000 times round Southside, or\nfrom here to Gretna Green and\nback again. To those statisticians\nacc us toni ed to Pan Am passenger\nseat miles stretching forty times\nround the earth, this is pretty\nsmall potatoes (ouch!), but it\nnevertheless represents a lot of\neating.\nThe kitchens possess five dish-washers, three in Southside and\ntwo in the Union. Between them\nthey consume \u00a3780 of detergent a year.\n1,600 people eat in IC refectories at lunchtime. Of these\nabout 600 go to Southside's lower\nrefectory; most of these go within\nthe peak half-hour.\nThe total turnover of IC refectories (this does not include Bar\nand Cellar figures) was \u00a3177,553.\nThe net takings were only\n\u00a3170,852. As the refectories are\nplanned to break even, this is the\nreason for the increase in meal\nprices. Catering purchases total\n\u00a3111,152, the bulk going on food\n\u2022\u20142nda sum of money that big\nbuys an awful lot of food. It's not mentioned exactly how much\nwas spent on replacing stolen\ncutlery.\nThe surplus for the b# rs last\nyear was a mere \u00a372. The Rugby\nClub must try harder.\n\n"

That's two this term (there's one looking\ninto the constitution), we should\nmanage at least halt a dozen when\nwe get going.\nJez\nI'm sure everyone will be\npleased to know that Jez has been\nsaved. The plans for the \" Save\nJez Fund\" have been abandoned.\nA surprise windfall in the form\nof a \u00a350 donation from the\nprinters of the RCS Handbook.\nIt seems they had this spare after\nthey'd collected the advertising\nmoney, and decided their conscience would be easier if they\ngave it to us. Nice of them\u2014\nwe just had to promise to use\nthem for the next three years.\nSexmania\nIt seems that some RCS girls\nhave got the wrong idea about\nBob's invitation to anyone to go\nand discuss things with him. He's not complaining but I think he\nfinds it a little wearying.\nOn the subject of Bob's women\nhe assures me that he is not engaged to Betty, but don't get too\nhopeful, girls, he still claims her\nas his only true love. For those\nwho don't know, Betty hibernates\nat Sheffield University, so you\nprobably won't have seen her.\nMore Gossip\nIt seems that the RCS Union\nOfficers are quite a romantic lot.\nWith Hon. Sec. Rog Webb engaged to Asst. Hon. Sec. Linda,\nEnts. Chairman Spooks engaged\nto Viv and Pete Hall, Chairman\nof Clubs and Mr. ICWA, in the\nrole of Don Quixote. But all\nthings considered Linda must\ntake the credit since Rog Webb,\nIC Rep. Stew Barnes and Physics\nDepartment Rep. Pete Dolwin all\nclaim to know a girl by that name.\nMackman defended\nGuilds seem to be getting afraid\nof our personable president. Andy\nJordan a Guildsman and founder\nmember of the Pooh Club has\nstarted a\" Deflate Mackman\"\ncampaign. When will they learn\nthey can't get a good man down?\nAnyway as the term draws to\na close on behalf of tbe Exec.\nI'd like to thank all those who\nhave helped organise or simply\nsupported RCS efforts. Whether\nit's by Morphy Day, R.C.S. Carnival, street collections, or carol\nsinging.\nIC Words\nOn omen\nSo much has been said lately about enticing women to IC that I thought I would have my say. Open days for girls schools will be very\nineffective and will probably only encourage a few who are impressed\nby the engineering and Physics buildings; show them the Chemistry\nbuildings and they'd run a mile. They never were very auspicious\nand now in their half demolished state even less so. (The demolition\nis however great entertainment as a change from lectures). The\nMaths building is not much better\u2014it gives one the impression that\nit was built around a lift shaft.\nArts Bias\nThe heart of the trouble lies in\nthe courses given in science in\nschool and the attitude of school\nstaff to science. In girls Grammar Schools and others the policy\nis pro-arts and science ta\"kes\nsecond place. Many headmistresses consider scientists ignorant\nand uninformed. Many who do\nrecognise scientists as intelligent\ngirls persuade them not to come\nto IC as this will \"narrow \" them,\nbeing completely scientific. They\nmust be told IC broadens any\ngirl's mind of necessity. Even\nif these visits persuade girls to\napply to fC how many will be\nable to fulfil the requirements?\nWith bias against science in girls\nschools the teaching will be much\nbetter on the arts side. After all\na good arts graduate hasn'ta lot\nof choice as to a job but a good\nscience graduate has a great\nchoice most of which are more\nrewarding financially.\nMore trouble\nIt is difficult to say how we\ncan get more girls to come to IC,\nbut I am sure that open days for\ngirls schools will be more trouble\nthan they are worth.\nICWA's Old Folk\nLast Wednesday, ICWA held\nits annual Old Folks tea party.\nUnfortunately only nine were able\nto come of a possible thirty who\nwere visited. However the party\nwas a great success and was\nthoroughly enjoyed by old folk\nand Icwarians alike. The guests\nwere served tea the cakes for\nwhich had been made by Icwarians in Mooney's kitchen the previous day. After tea carols were\nsung, led by members of the\nchoir, and all the old folks were\ngiven Christmas presents.\nPoem\nPete Hall and Mysza deserve a medal for getting up at 5.30 a.m.( when's that?) to go to Covent\nGarden to get the Christmas tree.\nAt the end of the party a vote of\nthanks was given by Mr. Millman, one of the old gentlemen\nwho recited a lo;ig poem. The\nold people were then taken\nhome by volunteers from college.\nThe party was a great success and\nit is good to know that so many\nIcwarians will turn out to help\nsuch a worthy cause.\nGUILD SPOT The prophet spake and saye th:\" There shalt be a Swimming\nGala;\" and lo and behold on the\nfirst day of December in the year\nof our Lord nineteen hundred and\nsixty-seven there was indeed a swimming gala within the boundaries of the college named Imperial; and the three great tribes\nof this college, being exceeding\nwrathful with each other, did proceed to the water of combat in\nspecially armoured 43-seat cha-riots, whose drivers did control\nthe many horses with much dex-teri ty; and lo and behold they\nmade much use of that ritual\nknown since (he days of James\nand Browne as the \" hand brake turn.\" Whereupon the other road\nusers did cry with many tongues\n\" Hallelujah\" which is to say\n\" Thou f...ool chariot driver.\"\nAnd after they abode for forty\nminutes in WC2, they did\nrive at the promised land, which\nis known as Marshall Street\nBaths.\nAnd thereupon did battle com-men ce; and the waters were\nparted as the high priests of the\nthree tribes were hurled in ceremonial dress into the engulfing\nwaters; and there was great confusion among the people. But\nsuddenly, there came upon the\nassembled throng a silence for the\nwaters were turning purple! Then\nquoth the prophet: \"Yea, verily,\nit is the great god, Permanganate\nof Potash.\" And thus it was\u2014\nand the bath manager on seeing\nthis did cry aloud to the ne avens\" Lo and behold, thou hast\nworked a miracle here with\nheathen gods. Therefore depart\nfrom here ye cursed ones into the\nexterior darkness.\"\nAnd thereupon the tribes did\ndepart from that sport for ever,\nbut no gnashing of teeth was observed whilst investigating the\nlocal hostelries.\nSo who said the pool was in-violet?\nCarnival\nApart from the non-event of\nthe swimming gala, action continues in Guilds right up to the\nend of the Christmas term. Dick\nJames has organized a succession\nof Carnival collections to try to\nreach \u00a31,000 before the end of\none term\u2014almost a third of last\nyear's Carnival total. Congratulations and many thanks to all\nwho were involved.\nC.& G.U. Meeting\nThe final Union meeting of the\nterm was well attended by a noisy\nand responsive audience who saw\nthe presentation of colours to the\nMorphy and Lowry crews for\nvictories on Morphy Day. Some\nof the more well known Guilds\npersonnel were then involved in\nthe portrayal of the situation in\na nearby castle, and finally a suitably innocent person was\nfound guilty in the trial of the\nSpanner bearers and punished\nappropriately.\nSoccer\nFinally, congratulations to the\nGuilds Soccer team who beat\nRCS 2\u20140 in the first round of the\nTech cup\u2014let's make sure we retain this trophy in the next round.\nGENTLEMEN OF MINES Mr. M. von Kimmelman wishes to express his apologies to all\nMinesmen for ruining the last issue of Felix by forgetting to write the\nGentlemen of Mines column and causing the editor to print that\nlibellous comment.\nFreshers Falter\nA major talking point among the old lags in Mines has been\nthe poor response of fresher s in attending the various functions organised within Mines. We appeal to one and all to come along to\nany of these occasions and you will realise the true spirit which exists\nin Mines and which makes us unique in IC.\nForeign Miners at RSM\nThis week we are entertaining about twenty celebrated gentlemen\nfrom various notable mining schools in Europe including some from\nsuch far off countries as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. An\nextremely good programme culminating at IC's most splendid event of\nthe year, the Mines Ball, has been arranged by our foreign students'\nofficer, Charlie Savage, and it is up to everyone to support him so that\nwe can give our guests a truly memorable visit. Representatives\nfrom Mines have been to Delft, Trondheim, Prague and St. Etiennc\nthis term and they have all been treated magnificently so we must\nensure that our visitors are treated equally well.\nof Trophies and Pots and Mascots\nAt the union meeting last week the MacCartney Trophy, for\nsporting prowess, was presented to cross country runner Howard\nSmith (Met. 3) and the Freshers' Yard Pot was presented to I. Burgess\n(Met. 1) for a time of 11 seconds. The venue for next term's MiniV\nnight was also fixed and although Phil Hopwood's suggestion was\nunanimously accepted it was deemed impractical so that the outing\nwill be the Queen's Club for ice skating.\nThe meeting was told that Mines has acquired, out of Guilds\nunion, a yellow lion suffering from an impediment which could well\nbe foot and mouth (probably contracted from Dick James). A rather\nlarge cardboard replica of a spanner was picked up in Southside last\nweek by two Minesmen and this has now been suitably decorated by\nthe Hon. Pornographer in preparation for public display in Mines\nbuilding. The yellow teddy bear which was Camborne School of\nMines' mascot has been removed from the union office and nothing\nhas been heard of it for several weeks, so if anyone knows anything\nabout this creature could they get in touch with anyone on the\nunion committee?\nBlackmail or Blackcoat ?\nSince appearing on Morphy Day in very poor garb Ian Wells has\nbeen campaigning for a presidential coat and his demands have now\nbeen met. The ladies of Mines have offered to create, in suitable\ncolours, a coat of similar design to, but more resplendent than, the\npresidential coats of Guilds and RCS. In return for this deed the\nladies are asking for representation on the union committee and it is\nrumoured that the leaders of this suffragette movement may soon be\nseen chained to the railings outside Mines.\nBlack Memorial\nA new award has been set up in Mines this year in memory of\nthe late Professor Black, of the Mining Department. Under this\naward scheme, proposed by Mrs. Black, an RSM tie will be presented,\nat the committee's discretion, each year to the coloured African\nstudent who contributes most to the union in any non-academic field.\nIf you can solve this problem in under 3 minutes\nVSO would like to hear from you\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nInsert the missing letters\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n*\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nVSO needs 1500 volunteers for\n1968/69...\n...YOU?\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS\n3 HANOVER STREET LONDON Wl\n\n"

    "content": "4- FELIX\nCEDITOR'Somme nt \"Bastard,\" they say, \"fancy doing a bloody thing like that.\"\nSo talk people of the warden's reaction to the latest incidence of over-night-guest man ship in the halls. Or is he? I think not. This latest\ncrisis arose mainly through the fault of the residents of Southside.\nOne of the conditions of entry to hall is that \" residents shall not\nintroduce overnight guests without authority.\" Clearly the purpose\nof this rule is to avoid the halls becoming \" dos s houses \" or brothels\nwhich may prove distasteful to other residents and bring the college\ninto disrepute. However no rigid check is kept on residents' movements or on whom they take into their hall rooms. And so, done\ndiscreetly, I cannot see that it would be hard to introduce to the\nhall one's mate who has missed his last train. It is not, though,\ndiscreet to remove the cushions of the hall's communal furniture for\nhim to sleep on. To expect no action to be taken to support the rules\nagainst such open contempt is ridiculous\u2014It is, after all, conceivable\nthat the hall wardens actually believe in them, even if only in spirit!\nIn an effort to obtain at least discreet disobedience of these rules\nthe warden of Selkirk spent the first half of this term broadcasting\nthat intended to visit hall rooms early one morning. Residents\ncan't have failed to hear these rumblings\u2014he's told me three times and\nI live in the wilds of Beit; perhaps he thinks I might miss my last train\none evening!\nHowever I digress; despite this fore-running commentary of his\nactions, cushions continued to be borrowed and so it cannot be deemed\naltogether unreasonable that Mr. Seaford should follow through his\nthreat.\nIt was, I think, unfortunate that two people whose guests were\nnot using hall cushions should be discovered. But having been caught,\nthe warden and hall committee have little option but to meet out the\nnormal penalty, as a purely nominal punishment would make a further\nmockery of the already abused rules.\nThe two men who were evicted, although themselves taking the\nsporting risk inherent in having an overnight guest, have mainly their\nless discreet fellow hall dwellers to blame\u2014not, as is suggested, by\nsome, either the warden or committee of Selkirk Hall.\nThe recurring problem of overnight-guest man ship seems to a large\nextent to be restricted to an occasional sharing of rooms by males\u2014\nas opposed to the popular misconception of a mass influx of females\nfor long weekend \" lie-ins.\" I feel thai there is a logical and viable\nsolution which attacks the problem at its roots. That is to implement\nthe suggestion made earlier this year by the Tizard hall committee;\nto make available to residents camp beds which may be hired for use\nby their guests. Imposing a moderate charge and allowing a maximum stay of say two successive nights would ensure that the\nsystem fulfilled its purpose of catering for visitors to London and\nresidents' friends who have missed their trains.\nSwimming Gala\nAfter the drastic (ney devastating) desecration of the Union lift\nthat followed my remarks of the issue before last, I am reluctant to\ncriticise anything, less it magically disintegrates ! However I feel compelled to make some comment on that farce which wasn't the Swimming Gala. This the second sport function this year that has been\neffectively destroyed through the unthinking attitude of a few members\nof the Union. Morphy day was socially ruined because people\ncaused so much chaos on the way to the Putney towpath that the\nbattle, which is potentially fun and harmless to the general public,\nwas reduced to almost negligible proportions by police intervention.\nAnd now one or two people have not just ruined the social side of the\ninter collegiate swimming sports but caused the swimming itself to be\ncancelled.\nThe sort of attitude that induces such behaviour is more normally\nfound among kids of five\u2014a new toy is worth nothing until it is\nbroken and little sister's birthday party is ruined unless the prizes are\nstolen and at least half her friends are reduced to tears.\nWhat seems at least as relevant as the fact that such juveniles\nexist in our Union is that in the case of the Swimming Gala, the\nculprits have so far remained un apprehended for nearly a week. This\nleads me to conclude that either we all have the mentality of five\nyear olds or we don't really want these sports events- anyway. Are\nwe? or don't we?\nChristmas Finale\nThrough the ever increasing commercial image of Christmas I saw a way out of all my academic problems\u2014 \" ah-ha \" I thought,\n\" give away a free problem sheet with every Christmas Felix and give\na6d. prize for the correct solutions.\" Alas, this master plan fell\nthrough when my tutors refused to give me worked solutions against\nwhich to check the mound of replies from eager competitors.

Advocates of loans systems\noften point to other countries,\nespecially Sweden, which operate\nsuch schemes. In fact their use is\nexaggerated and The International Study of University Admissions concluded that loans\nsystems are comparatively rare.\nBUT a number of effects can be\nseen in those countries which\nhave introduced loans:\n(a) most institutions abolish\nfees and become directly Government run;\n(b) elaborate schemes of \" indirect support\" exist e.g. cheap\nrail fares, free meals and sub sidi sed housing;\n(c) examinations are taken\nwhen the student feels able to\npass;\n(d) there is widespread part-time work;\n(e) the number of women students decreases because of the\n\" negative do we ry\" they acquire;\n(f) loans are subject to stringent\nne an s tests.\nGraduate Pay\n2. It is often said that students\nwho enter higher education later\ngain financial advantages but the\nP.E.P. report \"Graduate survey\"\nand the Graduate Employment\nSurvey, 1962\" show that this is\nnot a general principle. Not only\ndoes later salary depend on class\nand subject of degree but also on\nfamily background and other than\nacademic capabilities, besides\nmany students non-lucrative pro-fess ions, e.g. teaching and social\nwork, which are already under-staffed. It is the aim of the tax\nsystem in this country to correct\nany imbalance earnings.\nInvestment\n3. Some people resent paying\nfor educational opportunities today which were unavailable to\nthem yesterday, but it should be\nrealised that education is not a charity but the soundest of all\neconomic investments.\nStudent Wages\n4. Lately the so-called brain\ndrain has been giving concern to\nmany people but it should be realised that if foreign firms recruiting in this country offer to repay\nthe outstanding loan debts of\ngraduates many more may be\npersuaded to leave.\nThe Robbins report proved\nthat the U.K. had the best pass\nrate in degree courses (77 per\ncent, Sweden 55 per cent) and\nthat these courses were completed\nmore quickly in this country.\nBecause of pur grants system we\ncan boast of a higher percentage\nof students frOm working class\nhomes than other countries. Finally a loans system would seriously affect residential colleges,\npost-graduate training and whichever authority had the complex\njob of administration.\nLes Ebden is a third year\nchemist and chairman of Soc.\nSoc. He is an active campaigner\nagainst loans.\nThere was, you see, this Irishman. Whether or not he was\nGerry Fitted for his job, I don't know, but when he asked about the\nminutes, there was grumbling on the Government front bench. What\nhad happened at that Cabinet meeting? Had Premier Ray Phillips\nreally been devalued? Could it be true that the IC bid to join the\nFrench Women's Association (London Branch) has been greeted with\na resounding \" Non\"? Was there really to be straight swap of\npositions between Jane Pearson and Martin Lack?\nThe Government was silent and as the rumours grew, the quality\nof Mooney meals dropped to an all-time record low. There was no\naction for a week\u2014the minutes of that Cabinet meeting had grown\ninto hours. Suddenly Chancellor \" Happy Dave \" Harris leaped to\nthe despatch box : \" No comment and no strings,\" he said, hoping\nto prove that Sunray Phillips was not manipulating him. He waved a Letter of Intent, the latest copy of the Executive branch's minutes. A sordid little document it was too. It revealed just how little the\nCabinet wished to tell the people while using more words to do it.\nOne fascinating sidelight mentioned that Irishman. But this one was\na devout Protestant unto his deathbed. And on his deathbed with all\nhis orange friends around, he was converted to Catholicism. \"Why?\"\nthey asked, the orange juice trickling down their cheeks. \" Tis better,\"\nhe said, \" that one of them should go than one of us.\"\nAnother small note mentioned complimentary Christmas presents\nto be given to appropriate people. The few short minutes were not\nenough to clear up this point but the Opposition had some suggestions: To give a phillip to the object of the \" Pray for Ray \" campaign\nby giving him a plastic jolly hockey-stick dolly which, when turned\non on its head, tells serious stories.\nFor Martin \" My Union \" Lack, a mini-vandal set as advertised on\nthe back of the corn flake packets. This comprises removable lavatory\npans in pol spastic ene,a detachable mascot which rings a bell some-where, for someone, when it is put back in place. Matt Busby says\n\" This is an ideal game for all United supporters.\"\nFor Keith Guy : A fairer share of Ents profits\u2014in plastic. This\nis, of course, a fairytale\nFor Sinclair Goodlad : Another staircase for Wells Soc. members.\nFor Rex Lowin, whose personal welfare seems to be coming along\nfine and for whom the bells toll next summer : acre che. But the actual facts of these Christmas presents for a Christmassy\nfuture remained obscured in a morass of verbiage. Like the other\nbranches of government, the Cabinet appeared reluctant to release the\nfacts. They even seemed reticent about disclosing sittings of the\nHouse. No wonder they were out of touch with the mood of the\ncountry : the publicity of the Cabinet was appalling. From wh?*\nthere was of it, it was believed that they were a group of girls with\nbeautiful backsides. One can only hope that the government publicity\nofficer was as gentle with his nudes as he was with his publicity.\nThe Cabinet is believed to think it is doing the best job possible\nunder difficult circumstances. It is known that they think the country\nto be a mess. A normally well-informed source reports Premier Phillips\nmeeting Mick Janes. \" Why,\" he asked, \" are you looking so dishevelled this morning?\" Quietly, Janes said, \"I 've just been dragged\nbackwards through a hedge.\"\nSuch are the heights to which the sources of Cabinet information\nrise. The Central Bureau of Statistics has a vital job on hand. And\nlet the people know what goes. Or are they Scared?\nFor myself, I deny being Colcutt. I love you. Merry Christmas to\neveryone else. And I should like to give Pete Ruhemann three\nsecretaries for Christmas . . .\n\n"

Food sap pie ment \u2014the secret\nof the Mooosy chip!\nA. Sc.W. Parking Row\nAt a recent General Meeting of the College Branch of the\nAssociation of Scientific Workers, the technicians union, it was\ndecided that individual members should write to the Chairman of the\nBoard of Governors, Lord Sherfield, to request the opening of negotiations on parking, between the college and the A. Sc.W. The union\nbelieves that the college's parking proposals have not been properly\nthought out and that they have a scheme which is fairer, more\npractical and less costly to operate. They are determined that the\ncollege plan shall not go through and intend to use all possible means\nat their disposal to stop it.\nAn A. Sc.W. agreement with IC outlines procedures for ne g6ti at ions on terms and conditions of service\u2014but the Rector, Lord\nPenney, does not consider this covers amenity questions, such as\nparking, and has refused to negotiate separately with any section of\nthe college.\nLast v ear the Parkin\" Committee recommence'' *b \u00bbt th pre should be no ch are e for nark in e places and that a central committee should allocate places on\nthe basis of greatest need, regardless of whether the applicant\nwas staff, student or technician\nand regardless of which department he belonged to. Sir Own\nSaunders, who was then acting\nRector asked the parking committee to reconsider his recommendation for an annual \u00a35 parking charge and they threw it out\nagain. Perhaps it is significant\nthat the student and A. Sc.W. members, representing nearly\n4,000 people, were particularly\nagainst a parking fee. When Lord\nPenney took up office as Rector\nthis term he reconstituted the\nparking committee, pushing\nthrough plans for departmental\nallocation of parking spaces and\nthe \u00a35 charge.\nSuperior plan\nMr. Harrv Fairbrother. branch\nsecretary of the A. Sc.W. and a tec tum in the Maths department,\nand Mr. Sic-s. A. cc.W.. representative on the parking commit-tee, are understandably annoyed\nat this undemocratic action, and\nintend to fight it to the end. They\nare particularly incensed that the\ncharge does not cover the cost of\nproviding parking places but will\ngo towards other amenities, and\nare taking legal advice on whether\nthe college charter permits such\ncharges to be made for amenities.\nThe provision of the Prices and\nIncomes Bill\u2014invoked frequently\nby the college during negotiations\non wages and holidays\u2014are also\nbeing studied. Other universities\nthroughout the country\u2014including Aberdeen, Essex and Southampton\u2014are said to be introducing charges for parking, and Government pressure is suspected.\nMr. Fairbrother, who was a member of the A. Sc.W. Traffic\nCommittee, has vast experience\nin the field of parking control and\ntraffic flow and is confident that\nthe A. Sc.W. parking scheme,\nwhich includes plans for a oneway traffic flow around the College Block area, is superior to the\nofficial college plan and has few,\nif any, faults. His union is also,\nworking on a scheme for time-controlled parking which should\nincrease the effective number of\nparking spaces by 20 per cent.\nIn an exchange of letters with\nthe Rector, Mr. Fairbrother has\noutlined his plans and pressed for\nserious consideration of them, but\nso far to no avail.\n\" paris-in \"\nIn actual fact, the difficult\nover provision of parking s pac should never have arisen, as GLX\nplanning regulations require on\ncar space to be provided for ever\n2,000 square feet floor space c new office block. In the case c the new college block, this wu ul c have meant that 900 space;\nshould have been available to\ncar owners in the college, and a there are only about 850 car users\nthe problem would have been\nsolved for many years to come.\nHowever, Mr. Fairbrother has\nascertained that, under pressure\nfrom the UGC, the college asked\nfor, and was granted, exemption\nfrom this requirement. As a result, only 400 spaces are avail-able, a number totally inadequate\nfor a college of this size, and when\nthe Architectural Association\ncome to IC the problem will get\nworse rather than better.\nIn view of the A. Sc.W.'s wide\nknowledge of parking problems,\nthrough their traffic committee,\nit seems odd that greater attention has not been paid to their\nproposals. The main body of\nA. Sc.W. members will fight them all the way with a number of\nmeasures they have worked out,\nculminating, in the very last re-sort, with a mass descent on the\nparking spaces, which they will\noccupy, more or less permanently\nwithout paying. The A. Sc.W. have heard that the college has\ntaken legal advice and found out\nthat if cars occupy parking space\nwithout permission or without\npaying, they are powerless to\nmove them. This may well be\nwishful thinking, but the technicians are willing to risk it.\nAs a footnote, it is interesting\nto examine the real reason for\nhaving park in a meters in South\nKen. If the proposed computer-controlled traffic scheme bordering the area breaks down and\ntraffic jams result, it is necessary\nto have some roads available on\na Fail-safe basis for dispersing\nthese hol duos. Queenseate and\nExhibition Road are two of these\nand the park in s meters are he inc introduced to clear them rea^v for the eventuality of a break-down!\nr4^ MA %\nMr. Harry Fan-brother, branch secretary of the A Sc.W. and Maths\nLecturer at I.C. Selkirk Search\nThe Warden of Selkirk Hall, Mr. Seaford, has at last carried out\nhis threatened early Sunday morning \" cushion hunting \" raid on the\nHall residents.\nOn Saturday 2nd December there was a party on a landing in\nSelkirk Hall. At about 1.00 a.m. while it was still going strong Mr.\nSeaford came down and warned those present that he would have a \"cushion hunting\" expedition early the following morning having\npreviously warned residents that he would inspect rooms without\nwarning if cushions continued to disappear. Two of the residents\nwere, according to eye witness accounts, so intoxicated as to be not\nresponsible for their actions\u2014and two girls stayed the remainder of\nthe night in their rooms.\ntour de farce\nAt 6.20 a.m. Mr. Seatord woke George Assimakis, Secretary of\nSelkirk Hall Committee, requesting him to accompany him on an\ninspection of residents' rooms, searching for the missing cushions.\nSurprisingly enough, no cushions were found. However, the two girls\nwere; although in one case the couple were fully dressed.\nCommittee over-ruled\nAt a Hall Committee meeting\non the following evening it was\nsuggested by the residents that the\ntwo boys should be barred from\nHall tiH the end of term and for the\nvacation and fined \u00a35. Mr. .Sea-ford overruled them and said that\nthe boys could remain in Hall till\nthe end of term, but would not\nbe allowed Hall residence after\nthat for the rest of the session.\nThey would of course be considered on equal terms with other\napplicants for next session.\nThey had a chance of appeal to\nthe Secretary of Halls of Residence Committee who happens to\nbe the Domestic Bursar, Mr.\nSeaford.\nOnce the discovery had been\nmade, Mr. Seaford seems to have\nacted in the oY i ly way possible.\nHe has, in fact, done more than\nhe need, for he had made sure\nthat the two residents have acceptable accommodation for next\nterm.\nTizard Beware\nDr. Cameron, Tizard Hall\nWarden, has now said that he too\nmay make cushion hunting exp e ditions, but would give residents\nthree days notice.\nGuilds\nat\nPlay\nTuesday's meeting of C& Gui rr iii members opened late as\ntradition c'e minds. There were\nthe usual prof t it ion of paper\ndarts n vi shouts of Up, Up, but\nno Selkirk cushions. After the\nun p tessa it t nes; of the minutes of\nthe previous meeting and Morphy\nBav had been read, the treasurer\nproudly claimed that C&G had\nm: tic a substantial loss during\nthe previous year, mainly due to\nthe president's large capacity !\nThen followed the election of\nthe ICWA rep. All candidates\nwere proposed by Dermott Corr\nin order to dispel doubts about\nhis sexual leaning. In the ensuing riot Randy Niandy's hair\ntipped the balance against\nMysza's figure and she was introduced to her duties during the\n.n suing darkness. When the\nvictorious Morphy and Lowry\nboat crews had been awarded\ntheir colours, Dick James announced that the carnival collection had totalled more than RCS\n& RSM's together and added that\nanyone who had not heard his\nvoice should join the carol singing party on Friday. Chris\nODonncii followed this up by\npointing out that the unplanned\nseries of non-events for non-enjoyment had be tna complete\nsuccess, particularly since IC is\nnow banned from all London\nswimming baths.\nThere then followed three exO u on nell Drunken Drama group.\nThe first portrayed a controversial ogre being seasick over his\nspiral beanstalk through over indulging in gin. The foul mouth claimed it was his first bite for\nweeks, but those who peep\nthrough key'ole s find tis'ard to\nbelieve. The second was way\nabove most people's heads and\nthe third; a trial of two \" spanner \" bearers accused of losing\ntheir tool was beautifully obscene.\nThey were aau it ted much to the\nsurprise of all present especially\nthe \" Ioveable\" vice-president,\nwhose self-incriminating evidence\nduring the trial resulted in his\nhair being rather forcibly curled\nby the new ICWA rep. and her\nassistant.\nMooney reported\nto W.C. On Monday morning, 3rd year\nPhysicist, Dave Bowater, and\nUnion refectory complaints officer\nRoy Allen w it to st*. Mr\nMooney, the le fec tory manager,\nto get an explanation of why\nthere was on one of the spoons\na mould-like substance. Mr.\nMooney said that this was nickel-oxide and was caused by continued contact with mayonnaise.\nHe said he did not know how the\nspoon had escaped the normal\nburnishing process and that the\nwhole system of cutlery was being\nimproved.\nDave Bowater, who said that if\nhe had not received satisfaction\nfrom Mr. Mooney he would have\ntaken the spoon to the Westmiri\nster City Council public health\ndepartment, his since found a fork in similar condition.\n\n"

    "content": "j NO MORE NAKED\nKNEES\nFor a club only one term old, the Scout and Guide Club is a roaring success. Even if considered as a na'ura! continuation of the\naxed Rover Crew, it is doing very nicely, thank you. But it can claim\nthe position of the most maligned club ir, IC. Nobody seems to\nbelieve that big hats and bare knees (or in the case of Icwarians, long\nblue dresses and the Vicar's wife) are out Trying to persuade the\naverage IC student otherwise is like warning a fresher about the Universal Meatball\u2014they just won't believe it until they've tried it them-selves.\nThe members of the club tend\nto come from every department\nat IC (even if Physics does seem\nto have a major shareholding) and\nevery year from 1st year C&G to\n3rd year PG. The unifying factor\nis interest in the club objects and\nactivities.\nThe club programme includes\nregular lunchtime meetings and a variety of weekend events. Lunchtime speakers this term have\ntalked on such diverse subjects as\nthe real meaning of the weather\nforecast, what living with a guide^\ndog entails and how to look mutilated (courtesy of the Casualties\nUnion).\nWeekends\nWeekend activities cater for\nthose tired of toasting by ultraviolet at the Plastic Fairytale but\nnot hearty enough for rugby.\nHiking is the main occupation at\nthese events, but great care is\ntaken to find a large dry cottage\nto stay in, preferably close to a suitable hostelry. The major\nweekend event of the term, a trip to Brecon Beacons, had to be\ncancelled\u2014we don't want the\nchairman to catch foot and\nmouth.\nThe club also undertakes a number of service projects. A request to bu;\nld a \"rabble tower\"\nwas joyfully accepted in the hopes\nof incarcerating some of the crab\nmembers. It turned out to be\na typing error and a rubble filled\ntower was finally constructed.\nOne weekend was taken up in\nclearing the banks of the Wey\nNavigation canal\u2014nobody fell\nin, but it was the wettest weekend of the term.\nExpeditions\nAs well as the normal term time programme, the club undertakes\na Summer Expedition in the first\nthree weeks of the Summer Vac.\nThis consists of going somewhere\nfairly inaccessible and doing a lot\nof hiking. Previous expeditions\nhave been to Jugoslavia, Iceland\nand elsewhere in Europe. Next\nyear will see a massive party going\nto the Jotunheimen in Norway.\nTransport\nAnother club activity is involvement in Union transport.\nThe crew managed the old RCC\nvan which slowly disintegrated\nBuHding the \u00ab rabble tower \" in record time.\nunder extreme wear. The decline was marked by bump starting on the Ml and the time the\nvan spat out bits of differential\non the Kingston By-pass. The\nclub are well represented on the\ncommittee running the new RC C vehicle, a shining white 1966\nTransit minibus (bookings to\nTransport Committee, c/o Union\nRack).\nLinks\nThe club does retain some links\nwith the Scout movement, assisting in the running of a number\nof troops in Westminster. Another responsibility is organising\nthe annual Venture Scout Decathlon, a sort of 24 hours assault\ncourse. The Marquis de Sade\ncould learn plenty from the methods used there. Last year pride\nof place went to a rope bridge in\nthe treetops. Links with the\nguide movement are somewhat\nhm it ed by the number of Icwarians.\nIntercourse\nThe Scout and Guide club has\nprobably the unrivalled opportunity to meet students from other\ncolleges and varsities at the thrice-yearly rallies of Scout and\nGuide clubs. These are held over\na weekend, and IC usually1 make\na big impact. Incidents at Loughboro' this term included the\ngentleman who fell into a very\nmurky river under the watching\neyes of thirty assorted students,\nthe completion of the IC chant\n(yes, there is one), against strong\ncompetition from Birmingham,\nand the song for a member of IC\nwho had his birthday there.\nThe club has an incident-full\nheritage and already has a number of incidents recorded for\nposterity in the club log. For\nthose looking for an opportunity\nto get out of the rut, the Scout\nand Guide club might be just the\nthing.\nHARD\nRAIN\nOn two nights recently, milk\nbottles have been thrown out of\nSouthside windows in the direction of the Mews. One bottle\nbroke a skylight of one of the\nMews houses and another narrowly missed a car. They are\nthought to have come from staircases 3 or 4, but could have come\nfrom staircases 2, 5 or 6.\nANNOUNCEMENT BY THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nBRANCH OF THE A. Sc.W. \u2022 STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY\nIn July the technical staff elected by ballot a representative to the\nCollege Parking Committee for 1967/68. The students union\nappointed two representatives also for 1967/68. That Committee\non September 14th, unanimously recommended no charge for\nparking in College grounds for the first year from the time when\nparking meters would come around I.C. This recommendation\nwas referred back to them by the Acting Rector and at the next\nmeeting on November 2nd the technical staff and student union\nrepresentatives still voted for no charge, since it represented the\nwishes of the technical staff and the students.\nOn November 16th, Lord Penney announced that a parking\nlevy would be imposed, and the Parking Committee forthwith reconstituted.\n\u2022 WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY ?\nG.L.C. statutory regulations require ONE parking space to be\nprovided for each 2,000 gross square feet in I.C.'s new buildings.\nTotal area in these u il dings is 1,800,000 gross square feet. Therefore 900 parking places should now be available for the 850\n(approximately) cars coming in or being used here. Under\ninstruction from the University Grants Committee, Imperial\nCollege claimed exemption from providing these parking spaces\nand so underground car parks were cut from the plans. (These\nwere promised in the original plans as far back as 1956.)\n\u2022 WHY MONEY IS ASKED FOR\nThis parking levy does not ensure an individually marked out\nparking space to those that pay. It is a levy designed to provide\nthe wages (\u00a314 per week approx.) of two additional gatekeeper s that the College thinks it may have to employ to prevent outsiders forcing their way in and parking. A careful analysis indicates that the College can keep itself free of this invasion using\nexisting staff without any additional cost.\n\u2022 IS THERE A REAL LONG-TERM SOLUTION FOR I.C.? It is agreed that the long-term solution is to turn I.C. and the\nMuseum complex into a pedestrian only area and put all parking\ninto underground car parks. Using our own specialist knowledge\nand acting informally as a trade union, we have something to\nreport. We have a promise that the G.L.C. traffic management\nsection would probably be prepared to provide a table around\nwhich they, the Westminster City Council, Imperial College,\nI.C.A. Sc.W., and any other actively interested organisation could\nmeet to carry th rou aha feasibility study on this project.\nALL THESE POINTS REQUIRE REAL DISCUSSION . . .\nCOME TO OUR MEETING FOR STUDENTS ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 11th,1968.

To avoid using the can opener and the frying\npan and to eat food which doesn't taste of colouring,flavouring and monosodium glut u nate? The answer is a little flavouring and careful buying. Wise\nshopping is without doubt the\nbasis of good cooking. Buv things\nwhich are cheap because the v are\nplentiful and not because of poor\nquality.\nIf you can't afford a steak b uva fresh herring. Dip in flour and\nfry gently in a little mar g. or oil:\nWhen cooked sprinkle with salt\nand squeeze lots of fresh lemon\non it. Served with a crisp salad\nand some brown bread it makes a splendidly cheap meal.\nSalads are a welcome addition\nto almost any dish. You can have\nthem with grilled meat, with a bought pie or with a cheesy dish.\nHere are two recipes : one for\nsummer and the other which you\ncan prepare in the winter months.\nSummer Salad\nYou will need:\nOne crisp lettuce\nTomatoes\nCucumber\nSome chopped green pepper.\nWash and shake lettuce well.\nMix two tablespoons olive oil\nwith one of malt vinegar, add salt\nand pepper. Whip all these ingredients with a kitchen fork\nuntil mixture becomes a little\nthick and is thoroughly emulsified.\nMix the roughly chopped lettuce\ninto your seasoning and toss\ngently with a spoon or fork. Add\nother vegetables on top.\nWinter Salad\nOne small head chicory\nOne Cox's apple\nOne medium carrot\nOne hard boiled egg\nCook the egg for ten minutes.\nMeanwhile wash and chop\nchicory. Peel and grate (with a coarse grater) carrot and apple,\nchop egg.\nWhip together (with a fork) one\ntablespoon olive oil and one of\nlemon juice. Add salt and pepper,\nmix with chopped ingredients. A little chopped raw celery goes well\nwith this mixture. This salad improves if it is allowed to macerate\nin its seasoning for about ten\nminutes or so.\nThese salads can often replace\nthe vegetables which are more\nelaborate to prepare\u2014especially\nthe winter ones. The carrot (that\nmost underrated vegetable) is an\nexception. Carrots are always\navailable and can be deliciously\ncheap when cooked like this :\nPeel and finely slice one pound\nof carrots. Have some hot water\nready in the kettle. Put a tablespoon of mar g. or dripping into\na saucepan. When hot add car-rots. Mix with a wooden spoon\nuntil carrots are coated with fat\nthen add half a teaspoon of flour\nand some salt; go on stirring for\na minute or so, then add enough\nhot water to cover carrots. Cover\nwith a tight-fitting lid, turn down\nthe heat and cook till tender. You\nmight have to add some more hot\nwater during cooking time (about\nhalf an hour) especially if the\ncarrots are aged ones.\nHere is a recipe for good\ntomato and meat sauce. Served\nwith rice, spaghetti or noodles\n(and followed by one of my\nsalads it makes a complete meal.\nFor two : use\u2014\nOne small onion\nOne tin peeled tomatoes\nOne ounce mar g. or dripping\n\\\\b good minced beef\nOne small green pepper\nwhen available\nSalt and pepper and a teaspoon of sugar\nFry the onion gently in the\nmar g or dripping; do not allow\nto brown. Add minced beef; allow\nto cook for two or three minutes\nwhile stirring with a wooden\nspoon. Add chopped green pepper and tomatoes. Squash tomatoes with your spoon ; add salt,\npepper and sugar. Add a little\nhot water, cover and allow to\ncook gently for half an hour. Add\nsome more hot water if sauce\nbecomes dry during cooking time.\nA dash of inexpensive cooking\nsherry (about a tablespoon) added\nabout half way through the cooking time gives this sauce that\nlittle \" je ne xx u.tc rito i.\" Serve\nhot on your cooked spaghetti\nwith lots of finely grated cheese.\nI am told that the best way to\ndecide whether the spaghetti is\nproperly cooked is to take a piece\nand fling it onto the kitchen ce il ing. If it sticks it is well cooked\nand ready to eat. I advise you to\navoid this method of testing as I suspect that landladies strongly\ndisapprove of such culinary ex-peri ment s. Here is a list of things to have\nin your larder which are needed\nfor these recipes.\nBottle olive oil (Boots have a good one in many sizes)\nMalt vinegar\nItalian peeled tomatoes\nMargarine\nCarrots (Keep well for a few\ndays)\nGreen peppers (Keep well for\na few days if they are good)\nCheddar cheese\nThe olive oil seems a little expensive but lasts a long time if\nonly used for salads. The other\nkinds of oil are not really nice\nenough to have with raw ve ge tables.\nBon ap petit.
