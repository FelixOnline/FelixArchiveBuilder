    "content": "FELIX\n22\nPoem for the week\nA R T S\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 20 MAY 2011\nExtract from \u2018Ode to a Nightingale\u2019\nby John Keats\nBetween 1860 and 1900, something extraordinary happened. A group of artists rebelled\nagainst the prevailing Victorian mood of the tiny\nbut demure middle-class and unleashed upon\nVictorian England art for art\u2019s sake, a movement which worshipped the sensuous and de-lightful, the Aesthetic movement (1860-1900).\nFrom its beginnings with Dante Gabriel Rosetti and the painters and writers he corralled,\nthrough the decadence of their portraiture, and\nthe furniture and pottery made to fill the homes\nof wealthy aesthetes, through the weather of\ncriticism and derision to the turn of the new\ncentury, this huge exhibition covers every detail thoroughly.\nThe gallery attempts to capture the lavish\nopulence of the Aesthetes with richly coloured\nlighting, recorded voices purring lines of prose\nand curly-typefaced notices, but you hardly\nneed them. From the enormous oil-paintings to\nthe reconstruction of fashionable rooms, fan-tastical furniture and sculpture, it is certainly\na treasure trove.\nWhether you enjoy the aesthetic of the aesthetes is another matter, although devoted apparently to the appreciation of beauty itself,\nthese artists had concrete ideas about what that\nentailed, and it reminds a modern audience\nhow our tastes have changed.\nThe air of languor which pervades the ideal\nthroughout is weighty, in a rebellion against the\nmodesty of buttoned-up society. It is amusing\nfor this modern congregation to see the life-less, mid-distance gaze of the muses which\ndrove some of the artists to the height of obses-sion, until their laudanum-induced deaths. Not\nthat all the portraiture follows Rosetti\u2019s dopey,\nsultry models, for me a major highlight were\nWhistler\u2019s gorgeously toned paintings which\ncapture people in an ideal light, without losing\ntheir animation. Whistler\u2019s etchings of London\ntoo are sweet representations of the city in delightful detail. Further on, you have the chance\nto see the ridiculous \u2018historical\u2019 dress and jewellery created for the newly luxurious aesthetic\nconsumerists. There is room for Oscar Wilde\nand his illustrated stories, and the satirical cartoons which came hot on the heels of the fadish\nart-loving middle classes.\nThe fads are also well documented, from the\nblue and white pottery with which Wilde filled\nhis student lodgings, to the Japanese obsessions coming from the opening of the closed\nstate to the outside world. It is a heady mixture,\nand if not all the aesthetics are to one\u2019s taste,\nthere is at least the (dubious) consolation of the\nsheer amount to look at.\nComing out of the gallery feels like emerging from a stupor into the light of the real world\nwhich the dreaming artists of over a century\nago tried so hard to hide from. The idolisation\nof leisure and inactivity is certainly a sentiment we can all appreciate to some extent.\nWE PAY AT THE V&A\nThe V&A is the perfect place for a lunchbreak, but the\npaid exhibitions showing until July might be an extra treat\nMaisie Russ\nJeez, all this chilling is really getting on top of me guys, seriously, I can\u2019t take it any more. Can we take an exam or something?\nThose gorgeous Victorians\nDrunk on the Aesthetic movement at The Cult Of Beauty\nLaus Veneris, Edward Burne-Jones\n\u201cThe idolisation of\ninactivity is a sentiment\nwe can all appreciate\u201d\nMY heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains\nMy sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,\nOr emptied some dull opiate to the drains\nOne minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:\n\u2018Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,\nBut being too happy in thine happiness,\nThat thou, light-wing\u00e8d Dryad of the trees,\nIn some melodious plot\nOf beechen green, and shadows numberless,\nSingest of summer in full-throated ease.\nO for a draught of vintage! that hath been\nCool\u2019d a long age in the deep-delv\u00e8d earth,\nTasting of Flora and the country-green,\nDance, and Proven\u00e7al song, and sunburnt mirth!\nO for a beaker full of the warm South!\nFull of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,\nWith beaded bubbles winking at the brim,\nAnd purple-stain\u00e8d mouth;\nThat I might drink, and leave the world unseen,\nAnd with thee fade away into the forest dim:\nFade far away, dissolve, and quite forget\nWhat thou among the leaves hast never known,\nThe weariness, the fever, and the fret\nHere, where men sit and hear each other groan;\nWhere palsy shakes a few, sad, last grey hairs,\nWhere youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and\ndies;\nWhere but to think is to be full of sorrow\nAnd leaden-eyed despairs;\nWhere beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,\nOr new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.\nAway! away! for I will fly to thee,\nNot charioted by Bacchus and his pards,\nBut on the viewless wings of Poesy,\nThough the dull brain perplexes and retards:\nAlready with thee! tender is the night,\nAnd haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,\nCluster\u2019d around by all her starry Fays\nBut here there is no light,\nSave what from heaven is with the breezes blown\nThrough verdurous glooms and winding mossy\nways.\nI cannot see what flowers are at my feet,\nNor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,\nBut, in embalm\u00e8d darkness, guess each sweet\nWherewith the seasonable month endows\nThe grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;\nWhite hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;\nFast-fading violets cover\u2019d up in leaves;\nAnd mid-May\u2019s eldest child,\nThe coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,\nThe murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.\nDarkling I listen; and, for many a time\nI have been half in love with easeful Death,\nCall\u2019d him soft names in many a mus\u00e8d rhyme,\nTo take into the air my quiet breath;\nNow more than ever seems it rich to die,\nTo cease upon the midnight with no pain,\nWhile thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad\nIn such an ecstasy!\nStill wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain\u2014\nTo thy high requiem become a sod.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n10\nIn brief\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Charlie Harvey\nKelly Oakes\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 20 may 2011\nWrinkles on the moon\nAlmost everyone thinks that it is possible to get a\nrough idea of a person\u2019s age by looking for wrinkles\non their face, but did you know that this principle\ncan also be applied to the moon? Scientists from\nthe California Institute of Technology have put together maps charting the slopes and roughness\nof the moon\u2019s surface. By studying the roughness\nat a range of different scales, from metres to kilo-metres, the researchers were able to put together\na complete picture of the ups and downs of the\nmoon\u2019s surface. But they are not just doing this\nfor fun, the map can be used to work out how certain lunar features were created. \u201cOld and young\ncraters have different roughness properties, they\nare rougher on some scales and smoother on others.\u201d said Meg Rosenburg, the first author of the\npaper in which the map was revealed. For example,\nyoung craters tend to stand out because they have\nnot yet been smoothed by constant meteorite bom-bardment. \u201cIt is remarkable that the moon exhibits\na great range of topographic character: at the ex-tremes, surfaces roughened by the accumulation of\ncraters over billions of years can be near regions\nsmoothed and resurfaced by more recent volcanic\nactivity\u201d said Oded Aharonson, Rosenburg\u2019s supervisor at the California Institute of Technology. Similar techniques can be used to study the processes\nbehind the surface features of other bodies in the\nsolar system, such as asteroids and even planets.\nKelly Oakes\nEveryone has heard plenty of apocalyptic\npredictions for the future of our planet, from\ncoastal flooding and in-land droughts to devastating changes in temperatures. Worryingly,\none of the most severe threats is the more-or-less unpredictable effects of climate change on\nvital food crops. A recent study in the journal\nScience negates the need for predictions by using actual cause and effect and prompting agriculture itself to turn over a new leaf.\nDavid Lobell, co-author of the paper, believes that climate change is \u201cnot something\nwe have to anticipate. It\u2019s something we have\nto learn from and deal with right now.\u201d\nAnnual global temperatures have increased\nby more than 0.4 \u00b0C since 1980. Such small\nchanges may seem insignificant but can have\nmassive effects on finely tuned plants. To\ngauge these effects the study recorded yields\nbetween 1980-2008 of corn, rice, wheat and\nsoya beans. These crops supply 75% of the\ncalories consumed by the global population.\nTemperature and precipitation changes outside of the normal seasonal variations were recorded and related to changes in crop produc-tion. Results indicate that warming accounted\nfor 3.8% and 5.5% losses in corn and wheat\nrespectively, whereas rice and soybean yields\nremained the same.\nIntriguingly, the trends vary massively between regions, with the United States and\nCanada suffering no climate linked decrease\nin food production, whereas in low latitude\nregions, an increase of 1\u00b0C has lead to a 10%\nincrease in yields. There are some positive effects of global warming as increased CO2\nand\nCH4\nin the atmosphere can boost plant produc-tivity, however in the future such benefits may\nbe overthrown by damage to plants caused by\nthe increased temperatures.\nLobell aims to look at areas with the biggest\ntemperature change, where agricultural adaptations are needed the most.\nClimate change causing crop calamaties\nKatie Tomlinson\nAs a biologist, I do not mind telling you that\nit is hard to find practical applications for behavioural studies of animals. I can get incredibly excited about how animals can move as a\ngroup, reacting to their environment without a\nparticular leader guiding them. The way they\nachieve this is fascinating. But useful? I would\nhave trouble arguing that one.\nSo when Dr Frantisek Stepanek gave a\n\u2018Friends of Imperial\u2019 Lecture last Tuesday\ncalled \u2018Swarm Robots - the Future of Drug Delivery\u2019, I was fascinated. Dr Stepanek has been\napplying the biological concepts of swarms\nto a rather unlikely beast: nano-scale robots.\nUsing the ways in which swarming animals\ncommunicate in order for the entire group to\nfind source of food, Dr Stepanek has built na-no-robots (i.e. very, very small!) which could\nmove through the body to a particular point, to\ndeliver drugs to a certain region. Sounds a bit\ncreepy, right?\nBut these are not robots in the way we usually think of them. They are a chemical compound housed in a tiny package that has been\nbuilt to break down only when and where the\ndesigner wants it to. Dr Stepanek explained to\nthe audience just how they can create these robots to get around the problems with current\ndrug therapies. Drug delivery systems have to\nbe tiny to move around the body, so nano-scale\nsystems are perfect for this function. However,\nthere are challenges in working on the nano-scale. The forces acting on the particles are\nvery different to those that engineers are used\nto. Dr Stepanek, as an expert in particle engi-neering, explained these \u2018harsh laws of the micro world\u2019and how researchers can manipulate\nthem. By building up nano-scale components\naround a chemical, he can modify exactly how\nthey are stored to suit the desired outcome pre-cisely.\nDr Stepanek explained how there were certain chemical compounds that could be useful\ndrugs, but are very unstable and so administering them in pill form would be pointless. They\nwould break down before they could have any\neffect. But a nano-robot could move through\nthe body with the parts of the compound kept\nseparate until they get to their destination in\nthe body. Then, the robot would allow the parts\nto mix, creating the compound so it could get\nto work. This suggests that using nanotech delivery methods, many drugs which are currently unusable could be available for treatments.\nOnce the nano-robot has been built, receptors can be added to its surface, so that the\ncontents will only be released when the robot\nplugs into a certain cell type. Normally, the active ingredient in a pill has much poorer speci-ficity, affecting every cell in the body, not just\nthe ones which are causing the problem. This\nis usually relatively harmless, but in the case of\ntreatments like chemotherapy, it can be harm-ful. Using nano-robots, on the other hand, will\nnot release a drug until it meets a certain cell\ntype. This way, in the case of a treatment like\nchemotherapy, the drug could only be released\nwhen it gets to cancer cells, making the debilitating side effects of the treatment less severe.\nBut building just the one robot is not much\ngood. To get any kind of effect on the body,\nthere needs to be thousands of them, each releasing a tiny bit of the drug. This is where\nusing the concepts of swarm behaviour could\nimprove how the robots work. In the same\nway that animals can release a signal to other\nmembers of its swarm to indicate they have\nfound a food source, a nano-robot could release a chemical signal to other robots once it\nfinds its target cell, attracting the entire group\nto a particular site. This way, instead of the\neffects being distributed over the entire body,\nthe swarm\u2019s effect could be targeted to a single place, making drug delivery more efficient,\nand more effective.\nAnna Perman\nMy Chemical Robots\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look a day over 4 billion years, dear...\u201d\nNanorobots would be able to target certain cells, bypassing toxic side effects\nTargeted treatments possible with swarming nanorobots\n25 May 2011 5.30pm\nLecture Theatre G16, Sir Alexander Fleming Building\nIn the fourth Peter Lindsay Memorial Lecture, Professor Dame Joceyln Bell Burnell introduces the\npulsing radio stars she discovered as a postgraduate student at Cambridge. The discovery of pulsars\nopened up a whole new branch of astrophysics and\ngained her supervisors a Nobel Prize in 1974.\nThe pursuit of pulsars\n\u201c[Climate change] is\nsomething we have to\nlearn from and deal with\nright now\u201d\n\n"

They perform a number of vital functions, so when they go\nwrong the damage that ensues is often\nfatal for the cell. It is this form of damage that scientists suspect occurs in the\ndiseased brain and means the nerve cells\nfail to function properly.\nThe defective forms of the two pro-teins, amyloid beta and tau, have been\nknown to cause damage to brain cells\nfor many years. However, the knowledge that they conspire to affect the\nmitochondria provides a focus for scientists looking to unravel the precise\nway in which these proteins are linked\nto Alzheimer\u2019s.\nAlzheimer\u2019s currently affects over\n400,000 people in the UK alone and\nthe disease is not on the decline. It is\nhoped that, as these cellular changes\noccur before symptoms are noticeable,\nthey could provide an opportunity for\nearlier diagnosis. \u201cBy the time the cells\nare dead, it is too late to do much\u201d,\nsaid author of the study, Professor Gail\nJohnson. By identifying these early indicators changes in the brain could be\nrecognised decades before any memory\nloss is experienced.\nThe researchers also hope that increasing our knowledge of how mitochondrial changes influence the development of Alzheimer\u2019s will also\nuncover new ways to treat the disease.\nThe complexity of brain diseases makes\nit likely that new possibilities for intervention will become apparent as more\nis understood about the precise way in\nwhich the mitochondria work.\nMight a mitochondrion be connected with Alzheimer\u2019s?\nChloe McIvor\nThe month of May reeks of exam stress.\nIt is the time of year where historically\nwe start to panic when we realise that\nthat whole series of lectures that you\nthought were superfluous, were not,\ndespite that fact that going would have\nmeant missing Jeremy Kyle, The Weakest Link, or worst of all, Lovejoy. Panic\nensues, along with reams of photocopying of notes, and the process of cramming is begun in earnest.\nVirtually any stressful event triggers a\nvast array of neuronal and biochemical\nresponses, which prepares one to cope\nwith the stressful event, which can be\nanything from exams, an alarming twist\nin Neighbours, even to worrying about\nwhat happened to that My Little Pony\nDVD that your friend borrowed last\nweek. But could this stress be having an\nadverse effect on your body?\nIn response to these stressful stimuli,\nthe body takes action. The hypothalamus in the brain releases two hormones,\nin the form of corticotropin-releasing\nhormone (CRH) and arginine-vasopres-sin (AVP). It is these two chemical messengers that course through the brain on\ntheir respective pathways, and result in\nthe effects we see on the body. While\nAVP plays an important role, it is CRH\nthat is most interesting.\nCRH plays two roles important roles\nin the body\u2019s response to stress. One of\nthese roles is in stimulating the release\nof adrenaline, which engages the fight-or-flight response, priming the body\nfor action, and subsequently increasing\nheart rate, breathing, and alertness. Simultaneously, the adrenal gland releases\nthe messenger cortisol, which then races\noff, speeding up the body\u2019s metabolism.\nCortisol is really interesting, and\nwhile its related compound Cortisone is\nfrequently found in anti-inflammatory\ndrugs that treat skin rashes and asthma,\nit can also suppress the immune system\nand reduce inflammation within the\nbody. It is this latter function of cortisol that is pertinent to our search to\nsee how the body is affected by stress\nas it presents an interesting dichotomy:\nI can\u2019t stress this strongly enough\nGeorge Wigmore\nIf the exams themselves weren\u2019t bad enough, the stress they cause could kill you\nwhile cortisol speeds up metabolism, it\ncan also have a detrimental effect on our\nhealth.\nWhile the story linking stress and\nhealth starts a long time before the 20th\ncentury, we pick it up in 1998, when\nGailen D. Marshall and colleagues from\nthe Houston Medical School (Universi-ty of Texas), studied the effects of exam\nstress on 16 healthy medical students.\nMarshall\u2019s group looked specifically at\ncytokines, the signalling proteins secreted by particular cells in the nervous\nsystem. When the body reacts to stress,\nbesides from just releasing cortisol and\nadrenaline, it also results in elevated\nlevels of cytokines. Crucially, these\ncytokines act as messengers between\nthe brain and immune system, helping to regulate the immune response.\nThe study found that psychologically\nstressful situations, and the subsequent\nrelease of cortisol, can shift the production of cytokines from the type which\nenhances the body\u2019s immune response,\nto another type which favours antibody\nresponse. It is these antibodies that are\nused by the immune system to identify\nand destroy foreign bacteria and virus-es. This crucial change weakens the immune system and increases the chance\nof viral infections and other ailments.\nBut it gets worse. There you were\nthinking that stress will only give you a\nbad cold, and that all your issues could\nbe solved with a little convenient tissue\npack, with added \u2018anti-viral protection\u2019\nand a little bit of balm to sooth your sore\nnose. Well, you were wrong, as stress almost literally makes us age faster.\nIn the body cellular ageing is judged\nby the length of the end-caps which\nprotect DNA. Known as telomeres, every time a cell divides, they shorten by\na small amount. By the time a cell has\ndivided between 40 and 60 times, its\ntelomeres reach a critical length, and\nthe cell stops dividing, preventing the\ndevelopment of cancer, and damage to\nDNA. When looking at the links between telomere length and stress, Elissa\nEpel from the Department of Psychiatry, University of California, found that\nstress makes us age faster, as high levels\nof stress resulted in shortening of telo-meres.\nSo, what to do? Not only does stress\nmake us ill, but it is also killing us\nslowly but surely, eradicating the ends\nof our DNA, and make our cells age\nprematurely. While panicking about this\nwould only make the situation worse,\nthe best thing to do is to chill out, buy a\nnew My Little Pony DVD, and tell yourself that it will all be okay in the end.\nCellular changes occur years before the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s set in\nStress weakens your immune system and makes your cells age faster (no wonder he looks worried)\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 20 may 2011 17\nCOMMENT\nYes \u2013 Sam Horti No \u2013 Tim Arbabzadah\nA year after he joined the Conservatives in\ncoalition, he has gone from national hero to\npossibly the most hated man in Britain, but...\nI\nt seems that the public have decided, almost\nunanimously, that Nick Clegg is a \u201csell-out\u201d\nwho has betrayed Liberal Democrat vot-ers. Most of the contempt felt towards the\nDeputy Prime Minister seems to stem from\nthe Coalition\u2019s tuition fees policy, which will come\ninto effect in September 2012.\nAs we all know, the abolition of tuition fees was\nan important component of the Lib Dem\u2019s manifesto before the 2010 general election, and there is\nno doubt the promises they made attracted many\nyoung voters. These promises have not come to\nfruition. I believe, however, that labelling Nick\nClegg as some sort of traitor is both na\u00efve and\nreactionary.\nIt is clear to me that the Lib Dems played very\nlittle part in deciding tuition fee policy. We are\ntalking about a coalition in which Conservatives\noutnumber Lib Dems six to one in both the cabinet\nand the House of Commons. We cannot seriously\nthink that this idea is anything other than Conservative\u2013driven, or that scrapping tuition fees was\never on the table. Any attempt at implementing the\nLib Dem manifesto on the matter would have been\nquashed at an early stage \u2013 which is fair enough.\nAfter all, the Conservatives received the highest\nnumber of votes, so it seems right that they decide\npolicy. To say that the fact that tuition fees were not\nabolished shows that Nick Clegg cannot be trusted\ngrossly overestimates his influence. This is not a\n50/50 coalition, far from it. This is a government\nrun by David Cameron, who occasionally tosses\nhis deputy a political bone to keep him on side.\nDespite this, some people will still ask \u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t Nick Clegg fight harder for his cause?\u201d I feel\nthis type of question makes wholly unreasonable\ndemands of the Lib Dem leader. Early in the co-alition, questions about the stability of the government were rife, and the coalition was desperately\nclinging on to any sense of togetherness it could\nmuster. Was Nick Clegg really going to publicly\ndistance himself from the Conservatives to fight\na battle he was doomed to lose? It may have placated some of his supporters, but in turn it would\nhave given the public an insight into the lack of\ncohesion between the two parties.\nIt appears to me that the general failure to understand the Government\u2019s policy on tuition fees has\nfurther fanned the flames of the dislike for Nick\nClegg. I wish that people would read the fine print,\nwhich itself is very easily obtained. Of course, if\nthey did care to do more than a moment of research on the matter they would no doubt concede\nthat this policy, given the economic landscape, is\nentirely acceptable.\nIt is, as the Government constantly tells us,\na \u201cfair\u201d system, in which the poorest third of\nyoung people pay less, offset by those earning\nhigh salaries. Students only pay when they earn\nover \u00a321,000/annum, up from the previous figure\nof \u00a315,000/annum. If people read the facts and\nthought objectively, there would no doubt be a lot\nless animosity on the matter.\nNot only do I say that the general feeling towards Nick Clegg is unfounded, I say that we\nshould be thankful for the selfless act the Lib\nDems have committed. They went into the coalition knowing they would have to concede ground\non every front, and that this, inevitably, would cost\nthem votes. However, without them we would not\nhave a stable government.\nI would ask those who are so quick to belittle\nClegg to make a choice in their own minds. They\ncan either have a Liberal Democrat leader who\nfulfills their own personal desires by attempting\nto force his manifesto upon David Cameron, or a\nstable government in which Nick Clegg conducts\nhimself with subtlety. I would say that anyone\nwho prefers the first option is being a little self-ish. On the issue of tuition fees, they were simply\noutranked. I cannot see how Nick Clegg can be to\nblame for going back on his word when his influence on the matter was next to nothing. Unfortunately, as long as Nick Clegg\u2019s input stays, as it\nmust do, out of the public eye, his integrity will\ncontinue to be doubted.\nS\no, I am here to argue about why Nick\nClegg is a turbo douchebag. Typical\nstudent gripes about tuition fees, broken pledges, blah blah blah. I will address that very quickly right now. He\nsaid, during the tuition fee row, that he regretted\nmaking the pledge saying \u201cI should have been\nmore careful.\u201d Making it sound as if it is something\nhe did on a drunken night out and woke up hoping\nit was just a dream. Yeah, but that is just the tip of\nthe arsehole-iceberg.\nDelving a little deeper we find more examples\nof general butt-wipery. One prime example is the\nshamefully poor attempts to justify abandoning\npolicies that he previously said that he believed\nin. For example, he said that he changed his mind\nabout the cuts. Not after the election, but actually before the election. When asked if he had\nchanged his mind during the coalition talks he said\n\u201cI changed my mind earlier than that.\u201d This instead\nof telling the truth, which would have been less\nimpressive, and would have consisted of \u201cI had absolutely zero say, but now have to pretend I agree\nwith the cuts.\u201d I mean to be fair to him, it is not as\nthough he had any TV debates or other opportunities to inform the public, or indeed his own party,\non a crucial U-turn on policy.\nPlease do not think I fail to understand that the\npro-Clegg argument is in a nut shell: He is doing\nwhat he has to do to try and do the best for this\ncountry, this is the best way he can actually have\nsome power and influence etc (cue: power ballad\nwith picture of him shirtless, hair blowing in the\nwind). The trouble is he is intelligent enough to\nknow that this is not true, as he is not really doing\nanything at the moment. He got a referendum on\nAV, which was never really what the Liberal Democrats wanted, they have been talking about PR for\nyears. Apart from that, it is hard to see any of the\nmajor Lib Dem policies being acted upon. He is\nessentially starring in a play as Tony Blair opposite\nCameron\u2019s George Bush (1* - terrible acting, impeccable stage management and makeup though).\nYeah, the Liberal Democrats are \u201cin power\u201d, but\nthat means nothing if all you get is a few people\nwith some meaningless titles. Being \u201cin power\u201d\nfor the sake of it is pointless, unless you use it to do\nsome good. For example: If I were Dmitry Medvedev, which I will be the first to admit that I am\nnot, I would be the President of Russia. However,\nPutin would be the one making all the choices.\nWhat would I have except for a title in front of\nmy name?\nHe had other options to get real influence. He\ncould have told Cameron to form a minority government and that, while he would not have desta-bilised the government by constantly voting everything down, they would have to moderate their\npolicies to get him on side. This would give him an\nincredible amount of power and say in policy dis-cussions. It would not have given him a cool title\nthough, or the ability to go and do things like addressing the UN, and networking with people who\nnow know who the **** you are. He had a choice\nbetween power and a title. He chose the latter over\nthe former, and is continuing to choose it.\nHe currently has the option to just say no, and\nthat way he will be actually voting something\ndown in parliament. However, this could destabi-lise the very position that he needs to use to get his\npolicies through.\nOh, it all makes sense now. He is unable to influence policy. If he did he would lose the position\nthat enables him to influence policy, thus stopping\nhim being able to influence policy. It is a vicious\ncycle. So he is staying quiet and toe-ing the line,\nand using Vince Cable as a human announcement\nshield.\nI like thinking the best of people, so I will just\nhope he is na\u00efve and thought he could really do\nsomething in his position. I will give him another\nchance with the NHS reforms, as maybe he will\nstand up, find his conscience, and realise it is not\nneeded or wanted. More likely he will not and my\nprize will be a crushing sense of the injustice in the\nworld. Yey me.\nCAN NICK CLEGG\nREDEEM HIMSELF?\n\u201cI believe that labelling\nNick Clegg as some sort\nof traitor is both na\u00efve\nand reactionary\u201d\n\u201cBeing \u201cin power\u201d for the\nsake of it is pointless,\nunless you use it to do\nsome good\u201d\n\n"

The information\nwas encoded on the discs and the computer along with laserdisc player and\nDomesday discs were sold as a package\nfor around \u00a35000. At the time this was\nthe same price as a decent car so few\nschools could afford the package. A few\nlibraries and LEAs bought the system\nbut it was far from a wide distribution.\nFELIX Friday 20 may 2011 15\nTECHNOLOGY\n\u201cWhat good was a\ndigital archive that\nonly lasted just over\na decade when the\noriginal Domesday\nbooks had lasted\nover nine hundred\nyears?\u201d\nI\nn 1986 the BBC launched an\nambitious campaign to repeat\nthe Domesday Book collection\nof data in the 11th Century. The\ninformation was thought lost, a\nvictim to digital obsolescence which is\nwhen a form of data storage becomes\nunreadable due to outdated technol-ogy. Through the perseverance and\nhard work of many at the BBC and The\nNational Archives, the data gathered\nby over 1 million people has now been\nmade public again after 25 years.\nIn 1086 William the Conqueror commissioned a survey of the people of\nEngland with particular attention to\nthe land and resources owned by resi-dents. It was an attempt to work out the\nextent of taxes that he could charge in\ndirect correlation to the amount of land\nthat the citizens owned. The two huge\nDomesday books took a year to complete and William had died before they\nwere finished. Today though, they are\ndescribed by historians as one of the\nmost important artefacts of the Middle\nAges. The books give insight into daily\nlife for the English as well as important\npopulation distribution statistics.\nObviously this is a topic most talked\nabout in school history lessons but it\u2019s\nvalid amongst the technology pages because in 1983 an ambitious television\nproducer, Peter Armstrong, at the BBC\ndecided it would be a great idea to repeat\nthe data collection ideas of William the\nConqueror but with a technological twist.\nInstead of a traditional modern age\ncensus this would contain photographs,\naccurate local area, town and city descriptions as well as accounts of the\ndaily lives of people from all around\nthe country. It was treated as national\ncampaign and was taken up rapidly by\nlocal education authorities, schools, colleges and many individuals and families\nnationwide. Imperial College\u2019s own\nlecturer Gareth Mitchell was in secondary school at the time and vividly recalls\nbeing asked back by his primary school\nas he was one of the only people that\nknew how to program the BBC microcomputer with their information.\nA mammoth task\nArmstrong, whose idea the whole thing\nwas, recruited leading technological\nminds to the BBC including George\nNorth, head of innovation. Overall they\nhad more than 16GB of data (a staggering amount back then) in the form of 1\ninch tapes of photographs (in full HD),\nprogrammed documents on disks created by the BBC Model B microcomputer\nfrom schools all around the country and\nmany papers related to census data and\nnews.\nIt took two years of consultation, hard\nwork and the finest minds to digitise the\ninformation. In 1986 the most prevalent way of transferring information\nbetween computers was the 5 \u00bc inch\nfloppy disc and unfortunately they were\nonly capable of carrying a maximum 1.2\nMB of information. North battled with\nPeople became angry that the information they had so painstakingly collected\ncouldn\u2019t be seen easily. As time passed\nthe project was continually referenced\nas a prime example of digital obsoles-cence. It was only accessible by fewer\nand fewer machines each year. By 2002\nthere were barely a handful of machines\ncapable of reading the discs left in the\nworld. What good was a digital archive\nthat only lasted just over a decade when\nthe original Domesday books had lasted\nover nine hundred years?\nSeveral efforts were made to restore\nthe discs but ended in failure due to\nlack of budgets or arguments over the\nway the project should be represented.\nComputer clubs maintained that the\nmost important factor of the restoration\nshould be the meticulous recreation of\nBBC microcomputers exactly as they\nwere created. Archivists argued that the\ndata was the most important thing and it\nshould be extracted for use on any modern computer.\nSaved at last\nEventually another producer at the\nBBC, Alex Mansfield, was inspired to\nretrieve the data and make it available to\nthe public through the internet. He got\nback in touch with George North, who\nfelt that he had \u201cunfinished business\u201d\nwith the project so was all too happy\nto start the lengthy process of data re-trieval. The original 1 inch tapes were\nfound and scanned, the laserdiscs were\nconverted to a new digital format that\ncould be read by more machines and the\nmap of the UK which held the locations\nof all the data was resurrected. It took\na lot of patience to recreate the technology of 1986 but eventually it paid off.\nOnline future\nThe obvious question is how can we\nguarantee that this won\u2019t happen again?\nThe most important thing when it comes\nto data preservation and archiving is\nselecting a safe environment and suitably sustainable conditions surrounding\nthe data. I\u2019m not referring to the direct\natmospheric conditions, although this\nis important, but to the monetary and\npolitical situations of the company that\nretains the information.\nThe BBC is subject to fashions and\nbudget cuts and wasn\u2019t able to keep\nupdating the data onto new storage formats and it was hence almost lost for-ever. That\u2019s why they have approached\nthe National Archives in Kew to maintain the data. The National Archives are\nfunded directly by the government and\nthus are a lot more stable. They have\nover 11 million categories in their catalogue which doesn\u2019t sound like much\nbut as an example the First World War,\njust one item in the catalogue, has over\n35km of linear corridors full of informa-tion. They know how to keep information safe. Tim Gollins, head of Digital\nPreservation at the National Archives\ntold me why it will work this time\naround. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good\nthe technology is, it matters where the\ndata is. It\u2019s in HTML on the web and\nthe probability is that we\u2019ll be able to\nread this is in many years time as the\ntechnology is ubiquitous, this is why it\nwill be safer.\u201d\nThe BBC has now launched its own\nDomesday website at www.bbc.co.uk/\ndomesday and is fully searchable by\npostcode. Furthermore there are options to update the information and\nupload more photos and writings to be\npreserved for the future (hopefully more\nsuccessfully this time).\nCan we simply \u2018Ctrl+S\u2019 our past?\nJake Lea-Wilson explores the challenges that lie behind\n\u2018futureproofing\u2019 our history\n\n"

Amongst\nthem Pieter Hugo\u2019s astonishingly powerful picture of a man with a hyena, a really breathtaking piece. It is good value\nfor money whilst being possible to visit\nwithin half an hour.\nPhotographs by South Africans must\nsurely make one ask oneself why it matters that they are South Africans. It is\ninteresting to understand what we can\nfind out about the (dated?) concept nationality implied by this rigid labelling.\nThese are not after all necessarily pictures of South Africans; this is the post-apartheid generation of photographs,\nevery one taken in the last ten years and\nrepresenting a huge slice of South African attitudes.\nForget exotic landscapes and beaded\ntribal-wear, firmly relegated to tourist\nbrochures and Oxfam appeals, we are\nglobal now, and most of these photos\nfeel like they could be from anywhere;\nthey could have sprung from more or\nless any part of the zeitgeisty contemporary artistic world. That is because\nSouth Africans have the same interests\nand causes as you and I. And yet, we\nknow they are by South Africans. Does\nthat change anything?\nThere\u2019s a real richness in the themes\nof the photographs, largely because I\nsuspect, we understand that nationality\ndoes not restrict the themes of art. Many\nare about beauty, gender and sexuality,\nand interestingly so. A series of portraits\nof women take up a large section of the\nwall, South African lesbian women. Another part of a wall is dedicated just to\ntransvestites, male South African rural\ntransvestites.\nThe juxtaposition of affirming dignity and common humanity with the\ncareful cordoning off affirmed and rigid identity is a provoking one. On the\none hand, plurality is about the pride\nof each individual in their own identity,\nespecially for those who have for too\nlong been disenfranchised. On the other hand, respect for an individual and\ntheir personal identity does not actually\nYou walk in and there is a huge hall\nof whiteness, just one single dazzling\nroom, peopled throughout by the headless bodies of life-sized dolls dressed in\ncouture clothing. Do not worry though,\nyour \u00a37 has got you more than just a\nroomful of mannequins, oh no, there is\na whole audiovisual extravaganza to be\nhad. I headed straight for the long row\nof TVs strung up along the wall.\nThis technological experience (series\nof videos) guides you through Yamamoto\u2019s life; a young man fresh out of law\nschool in Tokyo who decided to follow\nhis love for fashion through fashion tuition to his own fashion label and one of\nthe most illustrious careers in the global\nfashion world.\nIf you have never heard of Yamamoto, you might still have felt his influence indirectly. He has pioneered\nandrogynous clothing for women and\nenormously oversized clothes for men\nsince his debut. He has shocked fashion pundits by producing ready-to-wear ranges which look more at home\non the catwalk. Yamamoto\u2019s created\nclothing designs for films, dancers and\nsports companies but the series of films\non show give you a brilliant introduction to all the crazy, brilliant things he\nhas been doing in fashion shows since\nthe 70s.\nWhat really strikes you from the concepts he has created in fashion is the\nsweetness of his insistence on utility\nand usefulness. It is lovely to see whole\ncollections of clothes based on boiler\nsuits, a show in which all the clothing\nwas modelled by real musicians (think\nfifty year old men with massive accor-dions) who played as they watched their\ncolleagues walk up and down.\nIf fashion is art then Yamamoto\u2019s\ncertainly is, his fashion shows are voluptuous with his meaningful ideas. As\nwell as important statements, there is no\ndenying that the clothes are technically\nclever and often transformative, innovative and beautiful. Some of the coloured,\nfolded extravaganzas are reminiscent of\nenormous flowers, and the most impressive mannequin in the hall is dressed in\njust such a glory of lemon yellow.\nOne show featured the enactment of\na wedding where the bride and groom\narrived in matching black suits and proceeded to swap clothing so as to become\nindistinguishable. I was not sure of the\nmessage until two people wandered up\nbehind me in the gallery complaining\nin horrified tones about the indecency\nof Kate Middleton\u2019s wedding dress and\nthe possible visibility of her nipples. Yamamoto\u2019s fashion kills that dead in the\nwater.\nAfter the slick audio-visual presentation of Yamamoto\u2019s work so far, the\nmannequins filling the hall were a bit\nof a let-down. His clothes look great\non people apparently but on the dolls\nthey tend just to look a bit mis-shaped.\nHis insistence on utility also means\nthat many of the clothes really are a bit\ndull too. Given how long he has been\ndesigning, there are not that many ei-ther, although for real enthusiasts it is a\ngood chance to have a good look at the\nclothes close-up.\nrequire the use of labels to pigeonhole\npeople who share a particular charac-teristic. It is particularly interesting to\nsee how the people of a country that is\nrecovering from the grievous wound of\napartheid choose to use the labels of\nidentity which we all deal with every\nday.\nThe photos live up to the promise of\ntheir eloquent themes as well. The huge\nprints manage to push some seriously\nexhilarating images out of their mount-ings, and make the audience take a step\nback to enjoy them.\nI think photography can be an art\nform that is difficult to appreciate, lacking unlike other workmanship that manual skill onto which our enthusiasm can\nfall back if the message of the art cannot penetrate us. The key to its appre-ciation, unsurprisingly, is a willing immersion in the artist\u2019s message. Only by\nbelieving that there is a message worth\nunderstanding and attempting to access\nit can you really enjoy and benefit from\nan exhibition of photography. This is no\ndifferent to any other art, but I felt this\nexhibition especially repaid many times\nthe effort invested in it.\nNew generation South Africa\nFigures and Fictions gives a platform to\ncontemporary South African photographers\nYamamoto\u2019s fashionable life thus far\nRetrospective fails to bring designer\u2019s work to life\nRox Middleton\nWill Sanssamis\nYou know what would go really well with this?

The Royal College\nof Mines and City and Guilds College\nwere situated to the north-east, while\nthe Royal College of Science stood\nopposite it on Imperial Institute Road\n(now Imperial College Road). But the\nmerciless modernisers at Imperial College and within the British government\nwere to smash this idyllic setting and set\nabout building the future of our university on the ruins of South Kensington\u2019s\nVictorian architecture. In 1953 the Government announced that Imperial was\nto double in size from 1,500 students to\n3,000. In an attempt to make room for\nthis unprecedented influx of students,\nImperial during the 50s and 60s would\nhave been a perpetual construction site.\nThe Union\u2019s top two floors were added\nin 1954\u201357; the Roderic Hill and Blackett buildings had arisen like counterweights to the Royal College of Music\nand Royal School of Mines by 1960;\nThe City and Guilds College was torn\ndown in 1962; and all the while the Imperial Institute suffered a death in slow\nmotion, ripped down section by section\nbetween 1957 and 1966.\nThe motivations of the modernis-ers were clear.

Renai can hear\ndisturbing sounds through her baby monitor.\nThings go bang at night and family is terror-ised by visions of scary spirits who show that\neven a smile can be petrifying. Quite sensibly,\nthe couple conclude that it\u2019s their house that is\nhaunted. Josh, even though he appears rather\nskeptical, decides to move. But this is all in\nvain \u2013 for the horrific events only become\nmore frequent than ever. Josh\u2019s mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), has, along with some\nhidden family secrets, a method of her own she\nwould like to try out. Her close friend Elise\n(Lin Shaye), an experienced medium with eyes\nof perception like no other, enters the house,\nand with some probing around, is sure that it\u2019s\nDalton that\u2019s haunted, not the house. It\u2019s a bizarre theory, with Wan throwing together some\nfairly far-fetched concepts of astro-projection\nand demonic possession. It may sound a tad\nsilly, but what did you really expect from a supernatural horror anyway?\nNo matter how many preposterous developments the film may hurl at you (even\nthe main villain looks like Star Wars\u2019 Darth\nMaul\u2019s long lost twin brother but with slightly\nworse graphics and make-up), the scares and\ncharacters remain effective. It certainly gets\nits job done, and surprisingly, without much\nblood. The number of characters stays restricted throughout, and Wan is a master when\nit comes to building tension. Most of the time,\nwe know there is something lurking in the\nshadow. We know there must be something\nbehind Josh or Renai as they worryingly walk\naround their house. It scares us more to think\nabout the different possibilities of what hostile things could be appearing out of nowhere.\nAnd with a sharp, piercing screeching of his\nLeave it to James Wan, the man behind Saw\nwho kick-started the whole franchise, to make\nanother low-budget thrilling horror experience.\nThis time there is very little gore, no limbs being hacked off, no scary man in a freaky mask\ntelling the victims that he wants to \u201cplay a\ngame.\u201d No, the villain here is far sneakier and\nsinister than that (hence the title). Plus with Insidious, Wan ventures out into the paranormal,\nas seems to be a popular crowd pleaser when it\ncomes to the horror genre these days. Even the\nopening score, loaded with string instruments\nplucking away, is similar to those of vintage\nhorror films that scare us even to this day.\nJosh (Patrick Stewart) and Renai (Rose Byrne) are a married couple with three young\nchildren who have had the immense good fortune of moving into a nice spacious house. One\nday the ever-so curious Dalton wanders around\nthe house, and whilst drawn by a mysterious\nforce, climbs up into the attic, and falls due to a\nbroken ladder. He seems fine as Josh and Renai\nrush to his aid, but the next day he ends up in a\ncoma with no sign as to if he will ever recover.\nDoctors cannot figure out what is wrong with\nhim, and no scientific explanation can be given\nfor his condition.\nBut this is when strange supernatural events\nstart occurring around the house. Foster (An-drew Astor), the middle child, claims he sees\nBollywood Bite\nCatching up with the Indian film\nindustry with Aamir Shamsi\nThe RA.One trailers have been creating a buzz ever\nsince they were released at the end of March. This\nsuperhero flick starring the biggest movie star the\nworld has ever seen, Shah Rukh Khan, is the most\nexpensive in Indian history and is being predicted as\na blockbuster to replace all others. With the Spiderman team in charge of the visual effects, Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Inception) providing the background\nscore and Akon lending his voice to a song, RA.One\nwill undoubtedly grab the attention of a larger international market come 26th October.\nThe third instalment of the Dhoom series has been\nfinalised to star Aamir Khan. With a new director at\nthe helm (Vijay Acharya) this eagerly anticipated film\nis set to release Christmas 2012.\nConfirmed! Yash Chopra\u2019s keenly awaited returning\nventure (after Veer-Zaara, 2004) to the silver screen\nwill star his favourite King Khan alongside two leading ladies yet to be cast. And none other than the\ngreat A.R.Rahman will be composing the music for\nwhat will undoubtedly be another mesmerising love\nstory.\nFriday 20 MAY 2011\norchestra, Wan delivers some finely crafted\nchilling scenes.\nWith fine performances from rather well-known faces, the family dynamic is easy to\nsettle into. Byrne can show fear exceptionally well, with her wide-eyed expression and\nscream appearing shockingly natural. Stewart, playing the well-known part of \u201cdoubtful\nmale\u201d is never annoying, but a fully committed\nfamily man providing as much support as he\nknows how. The most memorable are however\nthe two matriarchal supporting players, Hershey and Shaye, whose crucial roles bring in\neven more terror and intensity. Wan also has\ntime for some comedy too, believe it or not.\nThe two rather goofy co-workers of Elise,\nSpecs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus\nSampson), have a love-hate, bromance competition even in the midst of demonic invasion.\nThey provide a brief but much-needed break\nfrom all the jump scares, all the while not wasting time with trivial, needless scenes.\nEnding on an ambiguous note, there could\nwell be a sequel, depending on how financially\nsuccessful the film turns out to be. It\u2019s doing\nwell in the States, and because of its small\nbudget ($1.5 million), the returns have been\nimpressive enough. But it would be neater and\nat its peak just on its own. If the ideas here are\nstretched out even more with unnecessary fol-low-ups, with more absurd twists, that would\nbe pushing it too far. Whether you can be fully\non board with everything the film presents is\nobviously entirely up to you, but \u201cInsidious\u201d is\nso much more than what can be expected.

    "content": "FELIX\n12\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Charlie Harvey\nKelly Oakes\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 20 may 2011\nDr Stanley Siegelman\nSuha Bachir interviews this hugely influential radiologist\nW\nhen I was told I\nwould be undertaking my medical\nelective course at\nthe very hospital\nDr House graduated from, I was over\nthe moon. The famous Johns Hopkins\nHospital has not only seen the work of\nno less than 33 Nobel Laureates, it has\nalso been voted best US hospital for\ntwenty years in a row. When I first saw\nthe hospital, I must admit, I thought it\nwas more enchanted castle than hospi-tal. Having read up about the many influential physicians and scientists from\nHopkins, I was desperate to find out if\nit was possible to follow in their foot-steps, so when I came across Professor\nSiegelman, a very influential radiologist at Johns Hopkins, I jumped at the\nchance to interview him. Throughout\nhis career he has taught, edited a leading medical journal and made scientific\ndiscoveries as well as treating patients.\nI was keen to find out the secrets of his\nsuccess in combining medicine, science\nand teaching.\nProfessor Stanley Siegelman has been\nawarded numerous accolades including\nthe Gold Medal from the Radiological\nSociety of North America (RSNA) and\nGeorge J. Stuart Award for Medical Student Teaching.\nHaving written and co-written numerous books and over 350 scientific\npapers, he has helped pioneer huge advances in imaging. In 1977 Professor\nSiegelman directed Johns Hopkins\u2019 first\nbody Computed Tomography (CT) program that subsequently went on to be an\nextremely important diagnostic tool and\nused world-wide.\nProfessor Siegelman has trained some\nworld famous radiologists including Dr\nElias Zerhouni, former director of the\nNational Institutes of Health, and has\nguided and nurtured the careers of hundreds and still continues to do so today.\nWhat made you choose Radiology?\nIn medical school most of my fellow\nclassmates knew what they wanted to\ngo into. I had a problem because so\nmany different things fascinated me;\nI found it hard to choose. At first psychiatry interested me, but then I became\ninterested in cardiology and gastroen-terology also. I therefore postponed my\ndecision and joined an army Hospital\nwhere I spent three years doing internal\nmedicine. I wanted to go into a field in\nwhich I could be a true expert in and\nat that time there was not that much\nto know about in radiology, especially\nsince we did not have MRI or CT scans.\nAfter my training, however, things were\nvery different.\nBeing the editor of the journal \u2018Radiology\u2019 and being the director of diagnostic radiology while managing to\nteach sounds like a tough schedule, so\nhow do you manage to juggle it all?\nThere were crossover benefits between\nmy clinical and editorial activities. Being editor of \u2018Radiology\u2019 and being\naware of what would go into the scientific literature a few months ahead\nof time helped me communicate with\nstudents and residents to keep things\nexciting by staying at the cutting\nedge of science. Having credentials in\nchest, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular\nand musculoskeletal radiology really\nhelped me when I was editor. Additionally having my editorial offices\nright across the street was great since\nI could still lecture the residents while\nmaintaining my clinical work. It was\nideal because teaching has always been\nimportant to me.\nCould you please give a brief timeline\nof your academic life?\nInterestingly, my life can be divided into\ntwelve year segments. When I was 17,\nI finished high school; The second 12\nyears was after college and my internship at the army; The third 12 years I\nwas the Director of Diagnostic Radiology, during which time I developed the\nclinical programmes at Johns Hopkins;\nAfter those 12 years I was then made\nthe Director of Radiology at Johns Hopkins; I then carried on as editor of Radiology for 12 years; The final twelve\nyears, which brings us until today, I was\nrunning the residency program, and I\nmust say I still like clinical radiology,\nthe practise of it has improved a lot.\nWhen we are given the task of interpreting the results of patients we have an\ninformation system that lets us know all\nwe need about the patient. Before there\nwas a problem since there was no access to old films. Technology has helped\nradiology become more efficient and\nexciting.\nWho were the main people who encouraged you most in your career?\nI would say that in the earlier days of\nradiology, particularly in the 1950s, departments were not as large and not as\ncomplex. The chairman was a very important person as he had his hand in the\nday-to-day running of the department\nand his decisions were vital. The chair-man, Dr Harold Jacobson, influenced\nme most. He was very inspiring and\nknew and pushed everyone to do their\nutmost. Dr Jacobson loved to teach. We\nwould have daily conferences and when\nI was a resident he invited me to give\nsome teaching courses on musculoskel-etal radiology. One of his strengths was\nthat he broadcasted only favourable\nthings about people and whenever he\nhad a good resident he would let people\nknow, and I suppose that is what helped\nme a lot.\nWhat do you think makes a good\nmentor?\nIf I were to name a society of the best\nmentors I would call it the Isaac Barrow society. Isaac Barrow was a very\ngood teacher, and had many good ideas\nwhich probably led to the formation\nof calculus. In the 17th century it was\nhard to get support for oneself if one\nwanted to do research, so people had to\nbe sponsored by dukes and royalty. At\nCambridge University there is a scholarship fund called the \u2018Lucasian scholarship of Mathematics\u2019. Isaac Barrow\nwas awarded this prestigious scholar-ship, but he then gave it up to one of his\nstudents who he thought would benefit\nmore from this scholarship than him.\nThis great student was Sir Isaac Newton who was then able to continue his\nresearch without having to worry about\nliving expenses. Isaac Barrow therefore\nenabled his prodigy to continue his ca-reer. My mentor, Dr Harold Jacobson\nalways said that his aim was to train\npeople better than him, and I always\nkept this in mind.\nWhat do you think makes a good Radiologist?\nFirstly they have to have a good eye\nand be able to check abnormalities\nin an imagined study and correlate\nit with their knowledge and with the\nclinical history so a certain pattern of\ndisease has a different meaning; say\nfor example in an immuno-suppressed\npatient, a radiologist has to be good\nat integrating the findings and have a\nsolid knowledge of the clinical basis. I\nalso think a good radiologist has a very\ngood memory.\nHow does the next generation of scientists need to prepare for the future\nof science?\nThey have to pick an area of interest,\nnot rush their training and maybe take\nan extra year to do research and be\nknowledgeable about the background,\nhistory and techniques. When they are\nin the field they should make an assessment of what is there that we do know\nand should know. An important theme\nis what we can take from the bench to\nthe bedside.\nWhat is the best advice you would\ngive to students who are trying to decide their career path?\nMy best advice would be that I give to\nthe residents is four words \u2018GO FOR\nTHE JOY\u2019. Find out what things warm\nyour heart the most, gets you excited\nand makes you feel really good. That\nis much more important than the salary\nthat you earn. Different people find different things inspiring. Try to get to the\nstage where you think, \u201cI can\u2019t believe\nI get paid to do this job, since it\u2019s more\nlike play!\n\u201cTeaching has always\nbeen important to\nme\u201d\nMost people will probably agree that\nturning on a light is usually given little\nthought. A simple flick of a switch and\nthe darkness of the night is effectively\neliminated.\nFor a staggering 1.4 billion people\nacross the globe, this simple step does\nnot apply. The reason: No access to\nelectricity, and therefore no means to\nproduce light other than by open fire,\noil, gas or kerosene. On top of unaf-fordable cost, these light sources bear a\nvariety of effects potentially damaging\nto health.\nThere is a group of students from Imperial College who hope to be able to\nsolve the problem of rural electrification\nin developing countries. Having founded\nthe non-profit organisation e.quinox, this\ngroup plans to develop a \u201cblue print\u201d solution for affordable and safe electricity.\nThe students\u2019 model relies on a centralised power generation hub, the so-called\n\u201cEnergy Kiosk\u201d, and decentralised energy distribution via battery boxes. The\nbattery boxes contain the same 230 V\nA/C output as any ordinary socket and\ncan be recharged after depletion. Recipients of e.quinox\u2019s solution can not\nonly use the battery for lighting, but are\nalso able to charge their mobile phones\nor power small radios. This will help a\ngrowing market, current figures suggest\nthat there are 84m smartphones in Africa, a figure that has doubled in the last\nthree years. This power source allows\ne.quinox\u2019s customers, currently in three\ndifferent Rwandan villages, to run their\nown businesses and thereby contributing to the empowerment of the country\u2019s\neconomy, a key element to effectively\nreduce poverty across the globe.\ne.quinox is currently competing in\nthe JP Morgan Give-It-Away contest\nto secure US$50,000 for future proj-ects. The competition can only be won\nthrough votes from YOU, so give Imperial students your support by going\nto www.e.quinox.org/vote and selecting e.quinox as the organisation of your\nchoice. Then share this link with all\nyour friends and family!

    "content": "FELIX\n28\nGAMES\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 20 MAy 2011\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nWeb Games\nT\nh e Warhammer 40,000 universe\nis a violent place. There are literally a hundred ways to die: you\ncan be chopped up by a chainsaw\nsword, gnawed to death by a giant\nbug, have your mind blown up by a psychic\nspace-elf, or shot in the back by your own side\nto hide some obscure secret. Dawn of War II:\nRetribution is a real-time strategy game set in\nthe universe, and really brings the table-top\ngame to life.\nRetribution is a standalone expansion to the\nprevious Dawn of War games, which means\nyou can jump straight into it without buying\nany of the previous installments in the series.\nIt adds a sixth faction to the game, the Imperial\nGuard, basically ordinary humans who have\nbeen given a LASER rifle and shipped halfway\nacross the galaxy to die. They, and their tanks.\nLots and lots of tanks.\nAnd boy, the game looks beautiful \u2013 and it\nloves to boast. Explosions, dust, crumbling\nbuildings, rocks falling from the sky, huge laser beams of death. If you zoom in, you can\nsee that game developers Relic have put in a\nlot of detail into their models, and that each\none has a lot of character. It puts pretty much\nevery other real time strategy game to shame\nwhen it comes to colour and visuals. But, it\ndoes have the graphics requirements to match.\nThe campaign is a lot of fun. Since the\nevents of the previous expansion (Chaos Rising), the Aurelia sector has gone to the dogs.\nLong story short, the Imperium has decided\nthat they had enough of this stupid little sector and have decided to purge the sector of\nlife \u2013 including their own citizens. For the first\ntime in Dawn of War II, you can play as any\nof the 6 multi-player factions in the campaign.\nApart from the Imperial Guard and the Space\nMarines, who represent the defenders of the\nsector, you have the Eldar (angry space Elves\nwith heavy fire power), Tyranids (think Zerg\nfrom Starcraft), Orks (Orcs \u2013 in space!) or the\nChaos (evil space marines). The campaign has\ntwelve solid missions, and in each you start\nwith a small force of heroes and slowly run\naround the map, capturing resource locations\nand slowly building a large force to complete\nobjectives (mostly involving blowing stuff up).\nThe campaign missions are great and quite\nwell written, though the last mission was a\nbit of a grind towards the end. However, all\nsix factions basically have the same campaign\nwith the only difference being some dialogue\nand some (usually minor) storyline changes.\nWhile the campaigns are different enough to\nmake replaying it with a different faction fun,\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly disappointed\ncompleting the same missions again. The\nother single player mode on offer - Skirmish\nagainst the computer \u2013 was also disappointing.\nWhile the AI can put up a tough enough fight\nagainst newer players, most experienced players find this game mode to be a cakewalk.\nThe heart of the game, however, is the multi-player. There is no base building in Retribution \u2013 the focus is almost entirely on unit man-agement, tactics, and resource management.\nSo games get violent very quickly \u2013 there is\nno five-minute downtime at the start of games,\nyou are fighting your opponent from the first\nminute. Resources are obtained from capturing resource points spread across the map,\nand from building structures to secure these.\nThis makes games intense and action-packed,\nand a constant battle to grab control of re-sources. The game also rewards clever tactical\ndecision-making \u2013 using cover, flanking and\narcs of fire add an element of depth not seen\nin many other strategy games. In the game, it\nis quite common for a smaller but better controlled force to beat a larger force that has been\ncaught out of position.\nFor most multi-player games, each map has\nthree \u2018victory points\u2019, which work in a similar\nway to the control points in Battlefield \u2013 controlling more of the victory points than your\nopponent causes his \u2018tickets\u2019 to drop. The\nperson or team whose tickets drop to zero first\nlose. This usually results in huge, desperate\nbattles for control of important central locations as players jostle for position. There is\nalso the traditional tried-and-tested \u2018annihilate\u2019\nmode, where you simply try to blow up the enemy base before he/she does the same thing to\nyours. Multiplayer mode is tense, interesting\nand keeps you engaged throughout.\n\u2018The Last Stand\u2019 is the other main multiplayer game mode \u2013 it is a cooperative survival\nmode where you and two friends/acquaintanc-es/random Internet strangers fight off hordes\nof increasingly powerful enemies with a single\nhero, who can be customised with war gear\nwhich will grant special abilities like the ability to copy enemy units, or to teleport. As you\nplay and win, you level up and get even nicer\nwar gear, which is important, because the early\nwar gear is crap. It is a tough mode, quite un-forgiving, but it gets more and more fun as you\nunlock cooler war gear and tricks.\nRetribution is a varied, diverse, and pretty\ngaming experience. While there are some issues with the repetitiveness of the single player\ncampaign, and the Skirmish AI leaves much to\nbe desired, the multiplayer more than makes\nup for it \u2013 both the traditional head-to-head\nVictory Points and Annihilate games and the\nco-operative Last Stand modes are amazing\nwith competent humans at the keyboard.\nDawn of War II: Retribution is available now\nfrom Relic Entertainment and THQ for PC.\nRetribution is a dish best\nserved cold... with friends\nTagore Nakornchai has his space cake and eats it\nAmerican Football gets WAY more intense after the apocalypse\nClarence\u2019s Big Chance\ntinyurl.com/clarencesbigchance\nIn this super-retro platformer, you play Clarence, an\nobese middle-aged man with no prospects. Worst\nof all though, you have no date. Thus in many re-spects, this is an accurate guess at the future life\nof most male Imperial students.\nRPG elements are combined with the platforming\nas Clarence gets ready for his first big date, leading\nto a title that is packed with stuff to do and things to\ncollect. The platforming is rock-solid and has a very\nclassic feel, while the well polished 8-bit graphics\nput the icing on the cake of this very accomplished\ntitle.\nRoyal Wedding\nminiclip.com/games/royal-wedding/\nAre you suffering from Royal Wedding withdrawal?\nIs the lack of William-and-Catherine-related news\ndriving you crackers? If so, this hide-and-seek puzzle game will scratch the Royal itch. The premise\nof the game is simple: it is the day of the wedding\nand the Windsors have got a bit of tidying up to do.\nEach one needs to find a selection of critical items\nto help the day go without a hitch. Quite what His\nRoyal Highness Prince William is going to do with a\nhammer, ski goggles and a football shirt remains\na mystery, but if we knew it would probably have\nmade the wedding day a lot more interesting.\nI LOVE student riots in the year 40,000...\n\n"

Other ICBC crews\nfell foul of fate as steering incompetence of\ntheir rivals and rogue waves blocked the progression of strong Imperial crews and their\nchances of medals.\nThis was the first chance for Imperial\u2019s novice squad to experience side-by-side six lane\nracing and all took to it like ducks to water. The\nwomen\u2019s (cox: Jess Johnson/Sarah Tattersall/\nMaddy Whybrow/Rosie Davies/Harriet Cross)\nand the men\u2019s (cox: Johnson/Tom Carpenter/\nRobbie Hernandez/Alex Quigley/Tommy\nHirst) beginner fours came fifth and ninth re-spectively. Meanwhile, the women\u2019s beginner\neight (cox: Alice Wickham/Bowler/Whybrow/\nDavies/Cross/ Tattersall/Joanna Taylor/Rowena Harrison/Lucy Adkins) qualified third fastest for their finals and were eight overall after\nICBC look towards Henley\nfollowing impressive\ndisplay in Nottingham\n... Continued from back page a tight finish.\nThe remaining medals (all gold) were won\nby the lightweight men\u2019s squad. The four of\nTom Pearson/Tim Richards/Kimberley/Paddy\nHudson set the tone on the first day of racing\nas they won their heat, despite Paddy not sitting on his seat from the second stroke of the\nrace. They won the final by a convincing six\nseconds. Tension was high on day two as the\nlightweight eight (cox: L Richards/Pearson/P\nHudson/Kimberley/Brown/T Richards/Carpenter/ Jones/Ben Joakim) tested the scales;\nmost were on or below weight, with the exceptions of Paddy and Wilf.\nBoth managed to lose about 500g through\nexercise but Kimberley was having trouble\nlosing the last 200g. A quick change of kit,\nmultiple trips to the facilities (including one\ninfamous occasion) and standing oddly on the\nscales eventually paid off. Every last ounce of\nsweat was worth it as the eight eased through\ntheir heat over the course.\nIn the final, they beat off the competition,\nwinning gold, making the late pushes from\nNottingham and Cambridge look futile. After\nwinning in the eight, there was no rest for the\nwicked. The quad (Pearson/T Richards/Kimberley/Brown) jumped out of one boat into\nthe other and was back at the start in no time.\nThey led from start to finish. On day three, the\nlightweights completed the gold rush when the\nlightweight double (Pearson/ Kimberley) and\npair (T Richards/P Hudson) won both finals\neasily.\nIf one existed, the Man of the Regatta award\nwould go to Mr Wilf Kimberley for getting the\nmost medals (4 gold and 1 bronze) and for banter provision.\nA scrumptious barbeque was the fuel for the\nannihilation of the competition and now all\neyes turn to the rest of the regatta season and\nthe road to Henley 2011.\nFootball complete Plate\nand Cup double after overcoming spirited King\u2019s\nand leaving the plate as the team\u2019s final chance\nfor silverware.\nWith so much riding on the game, Imperial\nunderstandably started the game nervously,\ntakingl 10 minutes for Imperial to settle and\ngain an ascendency in terms of possession.\nHowever when ball reached midfielder Flo\n\u2018Hitzelsberger\u2019 Klein at the edge of the box,\nthe german non international fired an absolute\ncannon of a strike into the far corner to give\nIC a 1-0 lead.\nThe cup final was a few weeks ago now,\nand the more time passes the better this goal\nis in my memory. It was undoubtedly a stunner though.\nWith nerves somewhat settled, Imperial finally began to dominate possession and look\nmore composed on the ball. However just\na few minutes later a long ball over the top\ncaused an unexpected error from a man who\nhad previously been regarded of as one of the\nbrightest males in north London of African de-scent. As the ball sailed harmlessly to \u2018keeper\nDave the Save, Ogunbiyi inexplicably tore\ndown the opposing striker Tom Daley.\nWith the ball nowhere near the Kings player,\nthe penalty was a harsh decision, but one has\nto wonder what such a smart man was doing.\nOnce again, Haringey council\u2019s 1994 committee were placed under scrutiny.\nUnperturbed by Dave\u2019s reputation and ensuing nickname, the Kings captain slotted home\nthe penalty to level the scores.\nHowever, almost immediately, Imperial re-sponded. A good move saw the ball spread to\ndanger man Andy down the left wing. His pull\nback met Bizzel who went pow and stepped\nover the ball allowing it to run across the face\nof goal. Former captain and 5th team veteran\nMike \u2018two bites\u2019 Ridge was there at the back\npost to finish, in a fashion which was remini-cent of a Hollywood-esque script. One must\nask how many nights he must have spent\ndreaming of this moment; the ball was directed\nperfectly towards him and the goal was gaping\nhowever, Ridge missed. The ball hit his standing foot and ballooned, fortunately he had a\nsecond bite at the cherry as the ball landed at\nhis feet. Ridge\u2019s second attempt was more successful and he scored much to the relief of the\nrest of the team.\nThe second half saw Imperial dominate fur-ther, creating many excellent chances to put\nthe game beyond King\u2019s. However none of the\nchances came into fruition. You may not know\nabout him, but Bizzel was absolutely dominant\nin midfield. Combinations of Andy , Captain\nPricey, Flo, Wozza and Sim looked dangerous\nup front, and Mike lead the line exceptionally.\nAlthough the goal never came, the 5s played\nout the remainder of the game in the opposition half and finished the game on top despite\nthe addition of further goals which their performance deserved.\nI\u2019d also like to use this opportunity to thank\nthose who came but didn\u2019t come on, and those\nwho came to watch. Imperial\u2019s fans were a joy.\nConstantly enquiring as to the whereabouts of\nKing\u2019s fans and friends, their chants were innovative and vocal.\nTactical advice was also on tap. Right back,\nand 5s captain in waiting, Adam Watkin was\nconsistently reminded to hold the line to his\ndispleasure. Man of the match was mobo\naward winner failed.\n... Continued from back page\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 20 may 2011 29\nGAMES\nI\ncannot stand writing articles.\nThere, I said it.\nYou know why I detest penning these things? It is because\nonce a week I have to get off\nmy lazy behind, I have to stop playing\ngames and I have to churn out something for you lot to read. In general,\nthe more I enjoy a game the more hate-filled I become when I have to shut it\ndown and begrudgingly open up Word.\nI say this not to make you feel sorry for\nme, but for you to understand how high\nmy blood pressure rose when I realised\nI had to stop playing Plants vs. Zombies\non the Nintendo DS.\nPlants vs. Zombies is a sickeningly\ncute tower defence game made by PopCap, a company infamous for pumping out games as relentlessly addictive\nas most illegal psycho-stimulants, and\nPvZ is no exception to this rule. If you\nhad not guessed already, the game revolves around both plants and zombies\n(it is a no brainer really). Zombies are\ninvading your back garden/pool/roof,\nand all you have to save your brain\nfrom becoming a gourmet zombie\ndinner is a bunch of thoroughly lethal\nplants and fungi.\nVariety is the spice of life, and PvZ\nembraces this with open arms \u2013 there\nare 49 different plants at your disposal,\nsome vital, some so-so, and some that\nonly have an effect on one or two of the\n29 different zombie types, who are also\nunique in their attacks and methods of\nlocomotion. Ever wanted to see a zombie bobsleigh team or Gatling gun pea-shooter? If not, stay away from PvZ.\nThe game never overwhelms you\nthough, as plants (and to a lesser extent\nzombies) are introduced to you one at\na time after every successful level completed in adventure mode. In this way\nyou never feel particularly inundated\nwith excessive choice, but it does mean\nthat adventure mode never feels particularly challenging, unless you are feeling\nrather brain dead.\nOn top of all that you fight in different\nenvironments. Zombies are nothing if\nnot ingenious, and whilst they start attacking your back garden during the day,\nthings quickly change: Soon they are attacking at night and under the cover of\nfog, which forces you to change to night\ntime fungi to defend your home. When\nthey make plans to attack your pool, be\nprepared to roll out the aquatic arsenal.\nTo top it all off, your roof is the final\nstaging ground for their onslaught, necessitating the use of plants that launch\nrounds of corn, cabbage and melon. I\nwish I could dream this stuff up.\nI bought the game when it originally\ncame out on the PC way back in 2009,\nand after 120 hours of play since then\n(almost not all at once) I was of course\na little hesitant to try it out on the DS.\nWould the controls hold up? Would\nit run as smoothly and look as good?\nWould my eyes be rooted to the screen?\nSix hours in, I think it is safe to say that\nthe DS version of PvZ is not destined\nfor an early grave. Obviously the DS is\nlimited in its technological capabilities,\nbut PvZ holds its own reasonably well.\nThe touch screen is put to good use, and\nthe stylus control over the killer members of the Plantae kingdom is precise\nand natural, which is saying something\ncoming from someone so used to mouse\ncontrol on the PC version.\nThe graphics, whilst not being comparable to that of other platform versions,\nstill look good-ish. The various varieties\nof pernicious plants and uncouth undead\nare easily told apart, something that has\nto be admired in a game with so many\ndifferent towers and attackers besieging\nyour brain.\nThat being said, the DS version\nthrows up a few niggling issues that\ncannot really be ignored. The top screen\ndoes not do much at all, and considering how cluttered the touch screen can\npotentially get in the later stages of the\ngame it would have been useful to have\nit serve some other purpose beyond displaying cute zombie animations. It also\ndoes not run quite as smoothly as it did\nwhen I tried it some time back on an\niPhone, which is rather annoying considering the fact that the DS version of\nthe game costs even more than that of\nthe iPhone version. Not that I paid for\nthe game of course - I get this stuff for\nfree, suckers!\nThere is also a versus mode \u2013 but not\non-line \u2013 mode in which you can play\nwith a friend, in which one controls\nthe plant defence, and the other takes\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe\nto say that the DS\nversion of Plants\nvs. Zombies is not\ndestined for an early\ngrave.\u201d\nthe role of necromancer and summons\nzombies from graves to attack his or her\nopponent. Because none of my friends\nplay PvZ/own a DS/actually exist I never got a chance to try this mode out, but\nit looks like it could be fun for a good\nfew rounds.\nEven if you ignore versus mode completely there is still a wealth of other\ngames available including adventure\nmode, twenty-four mini-games, two\nsets of puzzle challenges, survival mode\nand the Zen Garden. Adventure mode\nis the first and only game available at\nthe start, and progress through it will\nunlock more plants and different modes.\nThe mini-games are what they say\non the tin, a range of short challenges\nthat break away from the regular flow\nof the game. In one rather out of place\ngame you have to shout into the DS to\nkeep plants awake, which caused an awful ruckus when I tried to play it in the\nlibrary. You would not have thought librarians could be quite so vicious...\nPuzzle mode flexes your grey matter,\nrequiring you to solve puzzles with limited resources available, i.e. Sun power\nand plants. Survival mode requires\nyou to survive 5 (normal) or 10 (hard)\nsuccessive hoards of the undead with\nthe same set-up, whilst survival endless takes it a step further, pitting you\nagainst a never-ending stream of ravenous reanimated cadavers. The current\nrecord seems to be 1,600+ waves, but I\nseriously would not recommend trying\nto emulate this feat. You have got revision to do, lazy.\nThe Zen Garden is less of a game\nmode than a relaxation one. In it plants\nthat \u2018drop\u2019 during all the other modes\nwill locate here, and you can spend as\nlittle or as much time as you want attending to them. In return they drop\ncoins when they are watered and \u2018cared\nfor\u2019 properly. It is not the most thrilling\nmode I grant you, but it is a sweet little\nextra.\nPlants vs. Zombies is most certainly\nworth your money if you have yet to\nplay it, but I would be wary about purchasing it on the DS if you have an\niGadget in your possession. The iPhone/\niPad/iPod Touch versions of the game,\nthough lacking the DS\u2019s extra mini-games, run a Hell of a lot smoother and\nlook a hell of a lot sexier to boot. At the\nend of the day, Plants vs. Zombies is like\na bikini model \u2013 it is amazing however\nyou look at it, but a bit of oil to smooth-en it up makes it even better. You can do\nwithout the drool though, for this game.\nPlants vs. Zombies DS is available\nnow from PopCap Games for all Nintendo DS family consoles.\nFlower power in your pocket\nLaurence Pope gets all green-fingered (and goo-stained) in Plants vs Zombies DS\n\u201c\n\n"

Want some quick advice from experienced travellers? Have a travelling tale to share\nwith Imperial?\nDrop us an email at travel.felix@imperial.ac.uk, or\nsend us a tweet using #FelixTravel\nIn an article from an issue past I dealt with\nVietnam\u2019s tyrant \u2018go.vn\u2019, a pseudo-social networking site where an optional friendship with\nthe communist party is compulsory, but now it\nseems that the attention is on China and her socalled \u2018great firewall\u2019. For some time now this\nhas been but a petty nuisance for most techno-philic nomads: nowadays most people are more\nthan acquainted with the likes of proxy servers\nand the basic internet connection alterations that\nwill get them access to whatever content they\nwant, wherever they want it.\nBut enter the Chinese government, who are\nnow heavily cracking down on virtual private\nnetworks, or VPNs, as a means of controlling\ninternet use. This shouldn\u2019t come as a huge\nshock: why wouldn\u2019t a powerful government be\nable to overthrow a simple technique used by\nschoolboys to look at boobs on Google images?\nFree speech group Global Voices Advocacy recently announced that new software which detects connections to overseas locations has been\nput in place by the government. There are also\nrumours that employers are ordering employees\nto avoid making certain connections out of fear\nof backlash.\nLast week I received several emails from\nfamily members of a girl I met whilst travelling\nlast summer: the last time she\u2019d been seen was\nin northern Vietnam en-route to China, and her\nrelatives were concerned as to her whereabouts,\ndue to lack of updates on the Twitter and Facebook accounts she\u2019d been using consistently for\nalmost a year. Eventually she managed to get\nonline to explain the situation, and has since re-submerged into the abyss.\nSure, it\u2019s a mild inconvenience that you can\u2019t\ntell your relatives your whereabouts, or upload\nyour token Yangtze swimming snaps, but it\u2019s\nclearly a much more pressing issue for Chinese\nweb users: not only are citizens restrictions limited in what they hear about the world outside,\nbut we\u2019re also left dependent on a few prominent bloggers to give us the lowdown on events\ninside China (at least until they get shut down).\nAs an outsider it seems like another totalitarian gadget aimed at repression, but I have no\ndoubts that those who want to work around the\nfirewall will invent new cunning ways of doing\nso, and once again be leading the technological\narms race.\nVenice: a pragmatist\u2019s guide\nThe great firewall of China\nChris Richardson\n\u201cWhat do you think of Venice?\u201d I asked. \u201cTourist trap\u201d, replied Dylan. When he next told me\nthat he hadn\u2019t even been, I decided his opinion\nwas invalid: I wasn\u2019t prepared to discuss the\npitfalls of this dream destination, considering\nthe countless praise it gets.\nFast forward a fortnight and I was in Venice, set to fall in love with the place. We wandered through the alleyways like tourists, but\nour stomachs soon needed filling and we could\nhardly care for Saint Mark and his lousy lion. I\nhad attempted to clue myself up on how to eat\ncome un italiano, or Venetian for that matter.\nThe city is known to serve food that is sub-par\nand the rules are common knowledge: waiters\nin bow ties who tout for business are a big no-no; any restaurant advertizing the pasta dishes\nfound in the Tesco Value range is a place best\navoided; spaghetti Bolognese was designed\nfor foreigners. Oh, and do it at the bar, not the\ntable.\nEvery corner has a shop that is ready to sell\n\u2018authentic local goods\u2019, such as the Venetian\nmasks made famous by the film Eyes Wide\nShut, elegant marbled paper pressed onto various stationery goods and Murano glass jewel-lery. They don\u2019t come cheap though, and the\nreality is that none of the souvenirs bought\nhere are going to serve much purpose other\nthan gathering dust. Simply smelling the air,\nfeeling the aging walls of the city once home\nto Casanova\u2019s reckless escapades, and savour-ing the tranquility of the quieter intertwining\ncanals were far more fulfilling.\nMy experience wasn\u2019t ever going to be akin\nto Johnny Depp\u2019s in The Tourist, but visiting the standard tourist destinations like The\nDogges\u2019 Palace, Rialto Market and Burano\nIsland were a must. The former boasts a few\nof the most breathtaking oil canvas paintings\nI\u2019ve seen outside of a gallery, and the grandeur\nof the place during the height of its power is\nsimply intangible. The Rialto market is an eye-opener and a place I roamed with a smile planted permanently on my face: innumerable trays\nof artichokes, zucchini of odd shapes and sizes\nand other colourful vegetables. Of course, the\nfishmongers dominated the place with their\nfreshly caught fish \u2013 tuna still oozing dark\nblood onto the ice, ink-stained squid and crabs\nstill scampering in their box of death. Burano\nIsland, with its brightly painted houses and a\nstunning view of the Serenissima from across\nthe water was one of the highlights of my visit.\nVenice has its charms, but more often than\nnot the fact that I was a tourist was shoved in\nmy face at every corner I turned, a feeling I\nrather detested throughout the trip. It\u2019s true\nthat there are more tourists than locals. I probably heard more British accents in Venice than\nI do in London on a standard day. And maybe\nthat\u2019s just the cruel reality of it: everybody\nwants a piece of Venice.\nDana Li\nAww shit! Get your towels ready it\u2019s about to go down! No seriously, I think we\u2019re sinking...\nI wonder how the firewall would fare against pure muscle. Well, this guy looks confident...\n\u2018Seoul celebrates Buddha\u2019s birthday\u2019 by Park Ji-Hwan\nGet there: Boris bike (\u2018cause it\u2019s faster)\nSee: Endless cocktail and blues bars\nEat: Mezze to share at Yalla Yalla\nCost: \u00a310-15 for nibbles between 2\nDitch mainstream Piccadilly and head into the unknown side streets: you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised\nat the supplies of swanky bars offering free music\nall nights of the week, cheap and delicious eateries,\nand a resident b@1 that trumps its lousy Hammersmith counterpart.\nWishing you were here\nTravel on your doorstep\nSeedy Soho: your 24/7 revision getaway\nDana Li\nDan Dos Santos\nRich Johnston\n\n"

This may sound like a cop-out,\nbut the album is a truly fantastic aural experience\nwhich, amazingly, sounds utterly contemporary, albeit in a rather experimental way. Every single song\nis sublime, but the moving Song of Solomon and the\ntruly haunting This Woman\u2019s Work really are standout tracks, both subtly better than the originals. The\nmost interesting moment, however, is on the first\nsingle from the album, Deeper Understanding, in\nwhich Kate autotunes her voice. This is not, however,\nmodern RnB, but a completely credible and artistic\nuse of the hated technique. Even if you aren\u2019t a fan,\nthe album is certainly worth a listen, if only to hear\nautotune used well.

But if you\nthink that, then you obviously haven\u2019t heard of Rodrigo Braga. Imperial\u2019s own guitar-wielding maestro\nplays a rather beautiful and original kind of funky\nLatin Jazz-Folk that constantly captivates with its\nsurprising chord changes and soothing rhythms. At\ntimes with the voice of Paul Simon or Stevie Wonder, at times channelling the ghost of Nick Drake,\nRodrigo will make you question why you haven\u2019t paid\nmore interest to Imperial\u2019s buzzing musical under-ground. Fortunately, he is playing a headline gig at\nEarl\u2019s Court\u2019s quirkiest caf\u00e9, The Troubadour, this\nTuesday, so get down there: it\u2019s guaranteed to be\nthe most enjoyable way to avoid revision.\nStephen Smith\nJoin in at: http://www.last.fm/group/Felix+Music\n1.

LCD Soundsystem\nwww.rodrigobraga.co.uk\nT\nhe idea behind Outlook Festival\nis straightforward: a large number of people; an 18th century\nfort; a strictly UK-Jamaican bass\nand dub sound; beach parties;\nboat parties and, if you need it, a coach named\n\u201cThe Sunshine Bus\u201d to get you from England\nto Croatia.\nThe festival, surely the best way of rounding off the summer, takes place between the\n1st and 4th of September. The line up is ridiculous (in a very good way), combining\nboth established old-timers and relative newcomers from the scenes of dubstep, garage,\ndnb, jungle, dub-reggae and grime. Expect to\nsee Jamie XX, Ramadanman, Untold, Girl\nUnit, MJ Cole, Hudson Mohawke, Bok\nBok, Skream, Benga, Marcus Nasty, Newham Generals, El-B, Shy FX, Barrington\nLevy, Channel One Sound System, Congo\nNatty, David Rodigan and Gentleman\u2019s\nDub Club to name but a few. Think of it as\nFWD\u2019s back catalogue meets Channel AKA\nwhen it was still called Channel U with a bit\nof Notting Hill Carnival thrown in for good\nmeasure.\nOutlook has been running since 2008 and\nhas grown considerably each year. If you want\nto sample it while it is still a relatively intimate\naffair then now is certainly your best bet. The\nfirst batch of tickets have sold out but festival\norganisers are considering the release of a sec-Wild Balkan jungle\nJacob Ward\nDuncan Casey\nIf you\u2019re a Pigeon Detective fan already \u2013\nguilty of singing \u201cI\u2019m not sorry!\u201d at the top of\nyour voice a few summers\u2019 previously \u2013 then\nyou\u2019ll love their new album; it\u2019s very much\nmore of the same but, in my opinion, a lot\nmore refined and musical, perfect to listen to\nduring these sunny days, whether out driving\nwith your mates or at a chilled BBQ in your\nback garden. Like previous songs released by\nThe Pigeon Detectives, it takes a few listens to\nreally get into it, but once you do, all the songs\nflow together and you\u2019ll know all the words\npretty quickly!\nFor those of you who are still mulling over\nthe title \u2018Pigeon Detectives\u2019, in an amused way\nbefore deciding, \u201cyea, ill give \u2018em a shot!\u201d,\nthey are a kind of mish-mash between Oasis,\nArctic Monkeys and The Wombats, with a\nbit of The Killers thrown in for this album.\nThey have heavy guitar riffs with, what I like\nto call, solid drumming, and simple lyrics so\nyou can instantly join in the powerful energy\ncreated by their front-man.\nThe opening song to the album \u2018She Wants\nMe\u2019 is a brilliant opener, getting you into the\nmood of the album straight away. None of the\nsongs really stand out as the best, as is often\nthe case with other bands, all are like a fun\ncontinuation of the last, not one song being\n\u201cthat one that you have to skip; they must have\nbeen having a bad recording day when they\nwrote that!\u201d. Their Single \u2018Done In Secret\u2019, the\nfirst released from this album, follows this \u201call\nequally good\u201d feeling, but in my opinion, there\nare in fact better songs than this one throughout the album.\nWith \u2018Turn Out The Lights\u2019 having a very\n\u2018Champagne Supernova\u2019 feeling and \u2018Through\nThe Door\u2019 providing a perfect festival crowd\npleaser, there is something for everyone on this\nnew offering by The PD, and I predict we will\nbe hearing a lot of these songs blasting out this\nsummer. In fact, I\u2019ll wager that you\u2019ve already\nheard some of them as, like with many of The\nPD\u2019s music, you encounter many of those \u201cOh,\nThe Pigeon Detectives\nThe Guilty Hands\nUp, Guards And At \u2018Em!\nDance to the Radio\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nRazor\nSlicethepie\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nDaniel Oppenheimer kicks off the Felix Summer\nFestival Guide with a preview of Croatia\u2019s Outlook\nI didn\u2019t know it was them that sings this song!\u201d\nmoments.\nThe Pigeon Detectives: \u201cUp, Guards And At\n\u2018Em!\u201d can be found on Spotify.\nAn unexpected gem. Imagine, if you will, The\nCure after a heavy night of barbiturates with\nFranz Ferdinand. In a disco. In Shoreditch.\nWhat\u2019s amazing about the single is that despite\nits almost self-parodying range of influences,\nthe result is remarkable and you\u2019re left wondering why more bands haven\u2019t tried Gothic\nelectro-pop when it\u2019s obviously such a winner.\nIt\u2019s stylised, it\u2019s sexy and in places it\u2019s downright deviant: probably not one for the Daily\nMail contingent, but then again that\u2019s a recommendation in its own right.\nDates: 1st - 4th September 2011\nLocation: Pula, Croatia\nPrice: \u00a3126.50 + Accommodation\nWebsite: www.outlookfestival.com\nond batch so get yourself to www.outlookfesti-val.com and keep your finger on the F5 button.\nFor anyone that doesn\u2019t know that\u2019s how you\nrefresh the page using the keyboard (big up\nthe computing department crew inside, I know\nyou\u2019re feeling that one).\nIt\u2019s the only festival in Europe thats held in a Mediterranean fort.

The fare will be added on to\nyour monthly bill, which means that fumbling hopelessly outside a cashpoint at one in the morning\nshould soon be a thing of the past. If, you know, you\nmanage to spot one of the 500 cabs in a city as big\nas London.

I write a piece\nabout modern art, say,\nonly to end up forcefully comparing\nDamien Hirst\u2019s latest oeuvre to a pickled turd. Artful journalism it is not. But\nthen, once a year, The Apprentice shows\nup and the jokes write themselves. So,\nhurrah from me.\nHowever, I am not writing to praise\nyou. Rather, I want to complain about\nyour disagreeable work ethic that goes\nalong the lines of: \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to\ndo all the work. I don\u2019t expect a sleeping partner. I\u2019m not St. Alan, the patron\nsaint of bloody losers. If things are going wrong, I\u2019m going to put your back\non the rails, and if things are going right\nyou\u2019re not going to get a pat on the\nback, you\u2019ll be told to do it even better still. You can look at it a bit like an\nuncivil partnership.\u201d\nThat is business, that is.\nOne can almost sense, between your\ngay innuendo and tough talk, how hard\nit must have been to refrain from blurting\nout, all Michael Caine-esque: \u201cYou\u2019re\nonly supposed to blow the bloody doors\noff.\u201d\nI fear hard work at the best of times,\nwith my lazy disposition, so a job with\nyou \u2013 a rather vile, University-degree\nhating-Eastender \u2013 is something I would\nnot touch. No, I just could not do it. If\nI had been in the boardroom \u2013 with its\ngrim air of depressing loneliness, drab-ness, and greed \u2013 at the time of your pep\ntalk, I would have gladly been taken\noutside and shot, there and then.\nWho would be na\u00efve enough, credulous enough, desperate enough, to want\nto work with such a miserable bastard?\nWell, as you have already taken part in\nthe first two shows of the series, you\nwill know.\nPeople whose entire project management plan is to \u201croll with the punches.\u201d\nPeople with nasal voices that whine\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the sky\u2019s the limit when\nthere are footprints on the Moon.\u201d People that think mentioning good looks\nis necessary on a job application form.\nPeople who, if they actually put their\nmoney where their mouth is, would\nchoke to death.\nOn the basis of the show\u2019s candidates,\nMichael \u2013 sorry, Alan \u2013 I am afraid you\nreally are the patron saint of losers.

It\nturns out exams need revision to pass, who knew. I\njust wish I was coming here next year (see the Turnip).\nHangman\u2019s Finest College News Source\nthe turnip\nEx\nams to be replaced by lottery\nA\nrecent survey to determine the main\ngripes of students showed that examinations and coursework topped the list.\nMany of the students who completed the survey said exams were an \u201cunfair system harming those who can\u2019t be fucked to learn shit\u201d.\nNow that Imperial College will be charging\nup to \u00a39,000 per year for tuition fees, Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) Charlotte Ivison used this\nopportune time to negotiate what many Welfare Officers have hitherto failed to: the abolition of exams. Any readers who are currently\nrevising should continue doing so; the new\nrules only come into effect from the 2011/2012\nacademic year onwards. Fast-tracking them in\ntime for this summer was on the table until the\nPresident, Alex Kendall, withdrew his \u201cblank\ncheque\u201d offer of sexual favours to the Rector\nat the last minute. Because of that moment of\nvirginal anxiety Imperialites will have to endure one more summer ruined by exams, just\nin case the rain doesn\u2019t get to it first. It should\nbe pointed out that both the Rector and Kendall deny that such an arrangement was ever on\nthe table, or indeed under it, but recordings obtained by The Turnip show repeated mentions\nof \u201cwhatever makes you comfortable\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m\nwilling to bend over backwards, literally\u201d, and\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to take a shafting on this one\u201d.\nOne source said the Rector rejected the offer\nas he \u201clikes big butts, and simply can not lie\u201d.\nThe transition to no exams will be a two-phase process: by Christmas of next year students will be given the option of entering a\nraffle to determine their grade, if they choose\nnot to sit the exam. The raffle will consist of\ntickets with a percentage grade written on\nthem; if too many students achieve high grades\nthe marks will be scaled down accordingly and\nvice versa. The following year the ticket pool\nwill be adjusted to prevent a re-occurrence.\nThese changes will come just in time for the\nhumanities exams at the end of the first term,\nwhich will come as a huge relief to the large\nnumber of students who do them because\nthey\u2019re an easy option and hate having to put\nany effort in. By the summer of 2012 they will\nbe abolished entirely, so even the masochistic\ndiehards who would still take the exams will\nbe left with no choice but to adapt to the new\nsystem.\nPreliminary speculation suggests that any\nextra free computers available in the third\nterm because of this move will be short-lived:\npasty World of Warcraft enthusiasts are likely\nto seize upon this to set up multiple 24-hour\nLAN parties in a Central Library devoid of\nunreasonable requests of students wanting to\nprint off exam papers, not only to level up their\nPaladins but to escape the harsh sun of the\nEnglish summer.

Most people have\ntried it, some are addicted to it and at this time of\nyear it is used by many\nstudents to help with re-vision. The coffee bean is one of the\nbiggest agriculture commodities in the\nworld, while the drink is omnipresent\nin today\u2019s 24 hour culture. Coffee bars\nare everywhere, as are vending machines offering a hot, sweet, rich tasting beverage for little more than the\nloose change most of us carry in our\npockets.\nThe coffee seen most commonly\n\u2013 served in boutique cafes and our\nown cafes around campus \u2013 is brewed\nthrough the espresso method. This\nmethod forces water vapour through\nground coffee beans, producing a concentrated liquid. This is great if you are\nstruggling through an advanced thermodynamics textbook, however, if you\nare unfortunate enough to find yourself\nqueuing up in the Library Cafe your joy\nmay be short lived.\nThe art of producing a good cup of\ncoffee is relatively complicated when\ncompared to the task of producing a cup\nof tea. Questions such as milk first or tea\nfirst are irrelevant when making coffee.\nThe beans should be roasted until they\nare a rich brown colour, then ground to\nallow the water absorb the flavour. The\nwater must not be boiling so that the\nbeans are not cooked, resulting in the\nbitter flavour in the espresso. The milk\nmust be heated and frothed using steam\nbut avoid boiling-induced rancification\nof the milk.\nI must stress I did say it was relatively\ncomplicated, just as breathing through\nyour mouth is relatively complicated\nwhen compared with breathing through\nhot you can turn down the temperatures\nor flow rates and avoid the horrible\ntastes associated with boiling.\nA reasonable assumption, in my opin-ion, is when I am ordering a coffee, or\nany product for that matter, the person\nmaking it will be trained and knowledgeable in that area. Just as when I\nworked in a bakery while in sixth form,\nit would have been reasonable for a customer to expect I was trained and had\nenough knowledge to produce the product they were purchasing.\nYet, again and again, I am left astounded by the inability of staff, particularly in the Library Cafe, to produce\na drink to even the standards, in terms of\ntaste or presentation, of a mug of freeze\ndried instant coffee. I do not expect our\ncampus cafes to produce a drink to the\nstandards of Caff\u00e9 Espresso, but surely\na coffee which is close to the drinkabil-You know the exam period is nearing\nwhen you find numerous cans of various\nenergy drinks scattered throughout the\ncollege, and your bedroom\u2019s floor looking like a scrapyard of said cans.\nThere are a variety of brands available\nin the market, ranging from the familiar\nRedbull to the aptly named Monster and\nthe newcomer Relentless.\nRelentless was launched in 2006, but\nthe sugar-free variant, Libertus, is new\nentrant this year to cater for the caffeine junkies. The 500ml can draws\nyou in with an ostentatious shade of\nelectric blue and its clearly superior\nsize, evidently appealing to the male\nspecies. Also, the exterior is accented\nwith streaks of lightning and the general melodrama associated with energy\njuices. The can is embellished with\nthe phase \u201cNO HALF MEASURES\u201d,\nan unmistakable attempt to draw comparison to the much smaller long-run-ner Redbull. Why fly when you can\ncatapault through the sky \u00e0 la Ironman,\nRobert Downey Jr style.\nLibertus tasted of the artificial fruity\nflavour that we are all rather accustomed\nto; in other words, it tasted like a Redbull clone. I was hoping for more innovative flavours, and Relentless could\nperhaps take a page from Monster and\ntheir coffee and tea flavoured energy\ndrinks. It not as sweet as Redbull, which\nis great for those who cannot stand the\nroundhouse-kick sweetness that is Redbull. Relentless is sugar-free but tasted\nevery bit like its sugared cousin, Relentless Original. It might be good for those\nsusceptible to a sugar rush.\n\u201cCoffee, most people\nhave tried it, some\nare addicted to it\nand at this time of\nyear it is used by\nmany to help us\nthrough the long\nhours of revision\u201d\nity of a Starbucks coffee is not unattain-able. From this I do not want anyone to\ntake that I believe what Starbucks serve\nis good coffee, however, its taste is not\nunpleasant relative to the drivel we are\nexpected to endure on campus.\nI was inspired to write this by two particularly abhorrent cups of coffee served\nto me by the Library Cafe. Normally,\nmy drink of choice is a Macchiato and\nfor those who do not have much experience of espresso coffee there are normally about six different basic ways to\nserve, which are common to most coffee\nbars:\nEspresso: Concentrated shot of coffee;\nMacchiato: Espresso with a small\namount of milk added;\nLatte: Espresso with steamed milk\nserved with a little or no foam;\nAmericano Espresso topped up with\nhot water;\nMocha: Espresso with chocolate syrup,\nsteamed milk and foam or whipped\ncream;\nCappuccino: Espresso with steamed\nmilk and foam.\nThe significance of the small amount\nof milk in my macchiato is that it reduces the bitterness, which has been present\nin every cup of coffee I have ever purchased on campus. This is the bitterness\nproduced through the cooking of the\nground beans at too high a temperature.\nThe first cup of coffee which I took\noffence to was served early in the\nmorning. While passing the Library, I\ntook a quick detour in the hopes of finding something which would awaken my\nmind before the day\u2019s revision. On the\nsurface, the coffee seemed very much\nwhat I was hoping for; once I took the\nfirst sip it became very clear it was not.\nThe taste was bitter, almost undrink-able.\nThe second cup underlines what I\nbelieve to be the more serious problem\npresent in college catering. On Sunday, I ventured from my department in\nsearch of a pick-me-up. The only place\nnearby was the Library cafe. I ordered\nmy usual Macchiato and when it was\npresented to me, it was clearly not what\nI had expected. It was something straddling the border between a small Latte\nand a Cappuccino. Too much milk and\nfoam to be what I had ordered. Some\nof you may say \u201cSo what?\u201d. You may\nthink I\u2019m being a coffee snob. I just\nwant what I paid for and want it made\nby someone who knows what they are\ndoing.\nWhen I worked as a baker I did not\nalways enjoy what I was doing, but I\nalways took pride in the products I pro-duced. I was never asked by a customer\nfor a loaf of brown bread and instead\ngave them six white rolls. Why is College catering unable to take the same\nopinion when they prepare food and\ndrink for the staff and students here?\nInitially this was going to be an article\nin which I ranted over a cup of coffee.\nInstead, in the process, it highlighted to\nme the issues that have resulted in the\ncollege population having to suffer substandard catering.\nIn any industry, companies and employees need to take pride in what they\nare producing for customers. In the\nsmall case of my daily coffee, I do not\nwant someone who neither drinks nor\nhas any knowledge of espresso serving\nme. I am sure this is the case for anyone who has a reasonable expectation of\nquality in what they pay for.\nPlease sir, where can I find good coffee?\nThomas McFadden isn\u2019t impressed with the caffeine on campus\nCoffee on campus: in need of the Kapow factor\nNow on the energy front, Libertus\nprovided an apparent boost in energy\nlevels for about two hours. It wasn\u2019t\ntoo extreme and I didn\u2019t feel like I was\nbouncing off the walls (editor\u2019s note:\nFlubber anyone?). It did give me a lucid sense of awareness though that was\nvery delightful, and really helpful while\nattempting to study during the early\nmorning hours. Best thing though, no\nsign of a crash.\nIn my opinion, I would actually stick\nto the tried and tested cup of strong\nblack coffee, or perhaps the more exciting flavours of Monster. But hey, every\nman to their own taste. Be a freed man,\nlike the drink reckons you\u2019ll become\nwhen you take your first sip.\nCaution: watch out for extreme car-bonation.\nAvailable in stores nationwide\nflickr/andai\nChin Hua Yap\nRelentless:\nLibertus\nAn antidote for sleepyheads\nduring revision season\nthe nose.

He was subsequently transferred to\nManhattan Criminal Court, where he was denied a US$1 million bail on fears that he might\nflee to France. He was then transferred to \u201cThe\nTomb\u201d, otherwise known as Rikers Island,\nNew York\u2019s main jail complex.\nThe alleged victim, a 32-year old woman\nfrom the Bronx, identified him during a police lineup. She claims that he came out of his\nbathroom naked, ran after her, attempted to\nforcibly have sex with her, and forced her to\nperform oral sex on him.\nBenjamin Brafman, Strauss-Kahn\u2019s attorney and one of the most famous lawyers in\nthe United States (he has previously defended\nMichael Jackson and Jay-Z and is dubbed \u201cthe\nman to have on speed-dial when you\u2019re in really big trouble\u201d) stated that his client \u201cdenied all\ncharges against him\u201d, and that he would \u201cclear\nhis good name\u201d. After the court hearing and\nthe denial of bail, Mr. Brafman told reporters:\n\u201cThe battle has just begun\u201d.\nFollowing the announcement of his arrest,\nreactions from political leaders in France and\nin Europe quickly emerged. Both members\nof the Parti Socialiste and Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s\nUMP reacted with sympathy, expressing \u201csadness, shock and bewilderment\u201d. Others expressed their belief that the affair might in fact\nbe a \u201csetup\u201d relating to Strauss-Kahn political\ninfluence and power. Contrasting with most\nresponses, Bernard Debr\u00e9, another member\nof UMP, called Strauss-Kahn a \u201csex offender\u201d, and said that his arrest had \u201chumiliated\nFrance\u201d. Marine Le Pen, President of the Front\nNational, France\u2019s main far-right party said\nthat \u2018[she] wasn\u2019t surprised\u201d.\nIt has been long known that DSK (as we\ncall him in France) is a ladies\u2019 man. In 2008,\nhe was accused of using his influence at the\nIMF to coerce one of his employees (who\nwas married at the time) into engaging in an\naffair with him. He was cleared of charges\nof harassment and abuse of power and later\napologised for what he called \u201ca serious error of judgment\u201d. His private life had never\nhad any consequence on his career until now\nand many French politicians before him had\nhad affairs, which never seemed to bother the\npublic opinion.\nAs head of the IMF, DSK has had a pivotal\nrole in bailing out countries such as Ireland and\nPortugal. The institution, which had a marginal\nrole before the crisis of 2008, emerged as one\nof the most important and influential actors of\nglobal economy under his leadership, and he\nwas widely praised for giving more power to\nemerging countries and changing the IMF\u2019s\nimage to that of an institution that helps countries in difficulty instead of starving them. At\nthe time of his arrest, he was due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin in order to convince her to support another bailout\nfor Greece.\nMany questions remain unanswered regarding his arrest and the crimes he has allegedly\ncommitted. According to initial statements\nfrom the NYPD, the alleged assault occurred at\n1pm, in DSK\u2019s room at the Sofitel New York.\nFollowing this, reports came in that he had already checked out of the hotel and was having\nlunch with his daughter at the time of the alleged assault, after which the NYPD stated that\nthe assault had in fact occurred at noon. Police\nare still trying to determine whether DSK left\nthe hotel in a hurry, and have also collected\nDNA from the alleged crime scene.\nIn France, photos of DSK wearing handcuffs\nduring his transfer to Manhattan Criminal\nCourt shocked people and since the denial of\nbail, criticism has emerged in French media regarding the handling of the case by American\njustice. Some have denounced the \u201cperp walk\u201d\n(intentional parading of a suspect) he was subjected to as \u201chumiliating\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d, as he is\nstill presumed innocent.\nStrauss-Kahn was expected to resign from\nhis post as Managing Director of the IMF in\norder to stand in his party\u2019s primary elections\n(scheduled in late June), during which members of the Party choose the Socialist Presidential Candidate. Many believed he was the only\ncandidate who could modernise France, and in\nspite of his previous affairs, he was expected\nto win by a landslide and then defeat Nicolas\nSarkozy in May 2012.\nThis scandal, however, has probably ended\nhis political career earlier than expected.\nNicolas Khadivi\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nUSA\nA mass grave was uncovered in the city of Deraa,\nthe centre of protests in recent weeks. 13 bodies\nwere found by residents last week. The bodies include\n5 members of one family, including 3 children. Pro\nregime news sources confirmed the existence of 5\nof the bodies but the government itself has flatly denied the reports. The discovery comes after weeks of\npro- democracy protests which began in Syria on the\n19th of March, following similar movements across\nthe Middle East and North Africa. The regime\u2019s crackdown on the protests has killed at least 500 people,\nlining the streets of Deraa with tanks.\nSyria\nArnold Schwarzenegger has admitted to fathering\na child with a member of his household staff.

I certainly hope it\nwas better than mine. Foolishly,\nI fell ill.\nIt began with a bit of a runny\nnose and I thought it was nothing. Then\nI started running a temperature and I\njust could not catch my breath. By the\nthird day, I felt like death with a hang-over. Reluctantly, I dragged myself to\nthe doctor\u2019s while my family painted\ncrosses on the front door. I thought it\nwas a bad case of pneumonia. I was\nwrong. It was much worse than that \u2013 it\nwas Mnemonia.\nMnemonia is a strange and curious\ndisease. Medical students are at an increased risk of contracting it but it can\naffect anyone with a lot to learn and\nlimited neural space. There is usually\na spike around this time of year when\nrevising students are frantically packing\ntheir minds with odd phrases and silly\nditties far faster than is considered safe,\nor normal. Occasionally, it has proved\nfatal.\nWhen most people get a chest infec-tion, they complain of a hacking cough.\nI instead developed an acronym cough.\nEvery five minutes, I would splutter out\nanything from AIDS to Y2K. At times, I\nwas horribly, horribly infectious \u2013 other\ntimes, I was just an annoying computer\nglitch.\nThis was a minor inconvenience.\nMy main complaint was my inability\nto speak in anything other than catchy\nmnemonics. It started out innocuous\nenough; when asked what I wanted to\neat, responding with, \u201cMy Very Early\nMorning Jam Sandwich Usually Needs\nPepper,\u201d earned me a slightly eclectic\nbut still edible breakfast.\nHowever, when I was stopped for direction by some tourists, they took my\nreply, \u201cSome Lovers Try Positions That\nThey Can\u2019t Handle,\u201d as a rather personal slur against them, rather than a way\nof remembering the bones of the wrist.\nI could see they were getting angry so I\ntried to explain. \u201cOh, Oh, Oh, To Touch\nAnd Feel Virgin Girls\u2019 Vaginas. Such\nHeaven,\u201d also fell foul. To cut a long\nstory short, a rare sequela of Mnemonia\nis an increased risk of black eyes.\nThis saw me journey to A&E. Staffed\nby doctors, the matured form of the\nmedical student, I thought someone\nmight understand my plight. After all,\nthis was one of those quirky, fine-print\ndiseases you only ever read about in\nbooks. My giddy anticipation unfortunately made my mouth run. \u201cRichard Of\nYork Gave Battle In Vain! Every Good\nBoy Deserves a Favour! Bad Beer Rots\nOur Young Guts But Vodka Goes Well!\u201d\nNaturally, they thought I was either\ndrunk or mad or both, as any sane person might reason. They promptly gave\nme a cold shower, a sprinkling of elec-tro-convulsive therapy and fumigated\nmy uterus, just for good measure. This\nfailed to treat the Mnemonia but I was\nmuch more careful about speaking now,\nso they deemed me cured.\nIn the past, sufferers of Mnemonia were cast out from society, left to\nwander in the wilderness. They were\nMemory overload\nchecked occasionally to see if they\nwere spouting any particularly relevant\nprophecies \u2013 you would be surprised\nat the number of doomsdays we have\navoided thanks to the Mnemonites.\nBut this is the twenty-first century\n\u2013 we have journeyed far from those\ndays of superstition and orthopaedic\nsurgery. My problem was that I was\nbursting with too many mnemonics \u2013\nmy brainstem was being strangled by\naides-m\u00e9moire. Somehow, I had to get\nthe excess mnemonics off and out of my\nfrontal cortex. One last mnemonic came\nto mind. Kiss \u2013 Keep It Simple, Stupid.\nSo I self-medicated by hitting my\nhead against a brick wall until all the\ndangerous knowledge came out and I\nfelt empty again. The ironic thing was\nthis was very similar to how I felt before\nI started learning those damn mnemonics to start with.\nCramming for exams can give you infectious habits\nRhys Davies\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nMwhahahaha, puny human, that mask won\u2019t save you!\n\u201c\ny\ny\nt.\nt.\nI\n\u201c\nk won\u2019t save you!\n\u201d\nMnemonia is a strange and\ncurious disease. It can affect\nanyone with a lot to learn and\nlimited neuronal space\n\u201cIt was much worse\nthan pneumonia - it\nwas mnemonia\u201d\nAny group of students enjoying a pleasant\nsummer\u2019s day on the Queen\u2019s Lawn would\nbe encouraged to look around them at the\nsurrounding architecture. It is fair to suppose\nthat bewilderment and dissatisfaction will be\nmore common reactions than, say, appreciation for a consistent architectural style.\nA common lament among students and\nstaff at this university is that the administration must have lost its head halfway\nthrough the last century, when the awful\nfolly was committed of tearing down most of\nthe original campus. Nowhere is this visual\nmismatch more evident than on Prince Consort Road. The Royal Albert Hall, the Royal\nSchool of Mines, and the Royal School of\nMusic, all fantastic specimens of Victorian\narchitecture sit incongruously alongside the\ndreary Roderic Hill building and the Blackett\nLaboratory (the prefix \u2018Royal\u2019 would seem\nto be a convenient indicator of architectural\nworth).\nIt is worth understanding why the imposing buildings that once occupied our\ncampus were dismantled and destroyed.\nOtherwise we might be inclined to entirely\ndismiss our predecessors as reckless Modernists, ignorant or uncaring of the cultural\ncrimes they were committing.\nImperial College London was an institution of approximately 1,500 students, at a\ntime of an emergency shortage in technical\nuniversity places. The government at the\ntime decreed that the College would expand\nto meet this national need, with little concern for the feasibility of such an increase.\nIn particular, the buildings bequeathed by\nthe Victorians were not fit for purpose.\nWhat role could ageing though beautiful\nVictorian museums of outdated laboratory\nequipment play in the functioning of a modern university? Far better to decide, as the\nCollege administration of the time seems to\nhave done, to spare no expense in building,\nsay, the finest Physics department in the\ncountry.\nThere is indeed a touch of nobility in the\narrogance with which this university decided that it had the authority, at that moment\nin time, to decide that such splendid architectural works were disposable in the name\nof progress.\nThis irreverence for irrelevance sharply\nparallels the aims of science itself: a scientist should have no regard for the toes\nstepped on in the search for truth.\nThe nature of science, after all, is to search\nfor the depth of complexity which underlies\nthe apparently simple. How perversely ironic\nwould it be for us to pursue those aims in\nbuildings whose facades were beautifully\npreserved but whose interiors were outdated and inefficient?\nFELIX\nOur loyalties lie with the\nfuture, not the past\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n18\nCOMMENT\nFriday 20 MAY 2011\nI want a good war...\nThere is nothing like the threat of being shot\nin the head, for reassurance. And whether\nor not the threat of that has befallen you,\nand I hope not, on the world\u2019s stage there\nseems to be something of a trend of conflict\nresolution and a supremacy of liberal ideals.\nThe conflict in northern Ireland seems at an\nend, there is continued progress of the democracy in South Africa, and the death of\nOsama Bin Laden signally a deep-if-not-fatal\nblow to the war on the faceless enemy of\nterrorism. Yes, terrorism and not \u2018terror\u2019.\nOnly Lynn Truss can be said to wage war on\na verb.\nA successful state visit of H.M. the Queen\nto Ireland seems a bit of an obvious thing\nnow, or at least one that should attract little\ndrama. However, thirty or even twenty years\nago, when those claiming to be the IRA were\nstill bombing parts of England, a state visit\nwas unthinkable. However, successive governments have made a real effort to resolve\nthe seemingly unresolvable conflict and so\ndespite Oliver Cromwell\u2019s manifest incom-petence, the situation is measurably on the\nmend. With 20-20 hindsight it is not hard to\nsee why \u2013 no one wants to feel they are in\nconflict, not really. It is too much effort and\naffords too much waste to be sustainable.\nThere is every likelihood that such conflict is\nan adaptation to mitigate population growth,\nmuch good that has done up against our\nsurvival instincts.\nThe change in the democracy in South Africa is perhaps less easy to see. Certainly,\nin the recent political activity there politicians have been quoted saying that the focus should be on the issues. Impressive\nstuff for a country with a democracy less\nthan twenty years old and one in a continent\nriddled with tribal conflict. Perhaps states\nin north Africa will also adopt this tack in\nthe future, once their democracies are\nestablished.\nThe faceless war on terrorism is perhaps\nharder to measure, but the apparent focus\nby intelligence services on it and lack of activity in the western world since 2005 suggests that that this too is losing its sting.\nWe cannot tell what sort of cover-up, if any,\nthere is by Islamic or any other fundamen-talists. However, if all the said extremists\nblow themselves up, there will not be any\nleft to hurt us or the religion they claim to\nrepresent anyway.\nThis gives us a peculiar quiet though.\nThroughout my childhood there was endless\nconflict \u2013 middle east, former Yugoslavia,\nChechnya, you name it. Of course not everywhere is stable and safe \u2013 it is not really\nsafe until Margaret Beckett goes there on a\ncaravanning holiday if you ask me \u2013 but at\nleast for the minute we have relative calm.\nLet us enjoy it while we can.\nSamuel Furse\nI\nlike England. No really, I do. But it is not\nsomething I would readily admit to as a\nScotsman living \u2018abroad\u2019.\nMaybe it is your unfriendly commuters,\nyour casual racism, or your chalky water that\nis slowly calcifying my kettle into a solid chunk of\nlimestone that oddly resembles the cliffs of Dover.\nWhatever it is, it has burrowed its way into my heart\nand it is there to stay.\nIt is no surprise then that I feel frustrated by the\nrecent results of the Scottish Parliament election \u2013\na landslide victory for the Scottish National Party\n(SNP). Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, has promised to hold a referendum on Scottish independence\nin the next four years. But why break up the Union?\nIs it simply national pride or something more?\nI have learned to understand Scottish pride. I\nattended a school named after William Wallace\n(Braveheart to you) built on the site of an historic\nbattlefield, where Scots fought against, you guessed\nit, the English.\nBut pride can have the power to alienate people\ntoo. Scotland\u2019s obsession with its nationalistic\ndreams risks isolating her from her closest neigh-bours. English people have become bored with\nthe Scots\u2019 unending patriotism and stopped caring\nabout whether or not Scotland stays in the Union,\nbut that is exactly what the nationalists want.\nAlex Salmond and the SNP have presented a\nmockery of what it means to be Scottish. They have\nre-written history as if all Scots ever did was roam\nthe Highlands chasing the mythical haggis and\nfighting the English. But if this is the country I am\nsupposed to take pride in, it is not a country I recog-nise. I have not suddenly become a Scotsman faced\nby a \u2018crisis of identity\u2019. It is just that there is more to\nthe country I was born in than what is written on the\nside of a pack of \u2018Scott\u2019s Porage Oats\u2019.\nScotland put its clans and conflicts behind it hundreds of years ago, to make the great intellectual\ncontribution to the Enlightenment of which Voltaire\nsaid \u201cwe look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation\u201d. It produced The Glasgow Boys who, in the\n19th century, put Scotland on the art-world map by\nleading on from the European impressionist move-ment. And its capital, Edinburgh, the UNESCO\nCity of Literature, now holds the world\u2019s largest\nperforming arts festival every year. None of these\nachievements could have been possible without\nconnecting with the world beyond national borders.\nOur only hope is that there are enough people\nin Scotland who can look to the future rather than\ndwelling on ancient rivalries, to vote against independence in a referendum. And enough English\npeople who can tolerate the Scots. We need to look\npast national pride, historic dogma and the colours\non our flags. So much so, that we can share this\nsmall island in the Atlantic Ocean together.\nAngry Geek\nT\nhe old adage about not discussing religion or politics with people is not to\navoid arguments, it is because doing\nso makes one far too aware of how\ncompletely objectionable every other\nhuman being on the planet is. I found this out last\nweek while responding to various opinions on the\neducation sodomy I wrote about. People whom I\nhad previously considered to be mildly disagreeable\npieces of raw white onion in the otherwise tasty\nsalad of life are suddenly revealed to be flecks of\ngrated cat scrotum dipped in vomit. And the only\nseasonings available to mask the taste are blind ignorance and seething acceptance.\nAlthough many people seem opposed to the notion that anyone should be able to bypass parts of\nthe application process, others seem to have quite\ndifferent opinions about what education is actually\nfor. By wildly different I of course mean, wrong.\nThis has surprised me when really it should not\nhave, since most of you are so wrong we could start\nawarding honorary doctorates in it.\nWhile discussing education reform with people,\nI came across a lot of opinions about what Universities are supposed to be doing, and some of the\nthings I heard said that Universities were really part\nof the economy. Big technology University institu-tions, such as Imperial, are there to help keep the\neconomy vibrant and full of educated people, and\nthat arts and humanities courses were \u2013 and I am\nquoting one of you here \u2013 a luxury.\nAnything can be treated as a luxury in life. You\nsimply take it away from people or start charging\nfor it, it becomes a luxury. Spotify \u2013 now a luxury.\nThe NHS \u2013 presumably soon to become a luxury.\nSomething is not a luxury just because you do not\nsee the point in it, however. And this is precisely\nwhy protecting our Universities and undergraduate\nstudents is so important.\nThe purpose of education is not to serve the coun-try, it is to serve everyone. It is to produce people\nwho are capable of thinking twice before allowing\ntheir vote to be swayed by a photo of a sad baby\nin a helmet. People who thrive when challenged\nindividually instead of wilting and looking for the\nnearest bandwagon. People who know that there is\nno point buying supermarket-brand cheese because\nyou are only cheating yourself. In economics, education is one of the most precious and important services possible. Anyone can use an education once\nyou have given it to them. They do not deprive people of the resource while they use it, and it neither\ndepreciates nor runs out. There is no such thing as\na luxury degree course; if people out there are passionate about golf course management, and willing\nto apply themselves to understand it, then so be it.\nIt is tempting to think of the University system as\nbeing one of those \u2018government policy areas\u2019 like\nthe NHS or the armed forces, but it is important for\neveryone that we give it as much autonomy as pos-sible, and that when we do interfere it is to make it\nmore accessible, not less. If we start chopping up\nthe education of our children based on what is going to make us money in the short term, we will find\nourselves a soulless nation of fast-food chains, all\nstaffed by PhD graduates.\nBen Scally\nEducation: not a luxury item\n\u201cBut why break\nup the Union? Is\nit simply national\npride or something\nmore?\u201d\nNational pride and prejudice\n\u201cThe purpose of\neducation isn\u2019t to\nserve the country,\nit is to serve\neveryone\u201d\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHave your say on this\nand other articles at\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Five of the six gold were won\nby the skinnier half of ICBC with the lightweights\nwinning almost every race they entered.\nOver the extended bank holiday weekend, Imperial journeyed to Nottingham for three days of intensive racing and was greeted by strong winds and\neven stronger gusts. As the conditions deteriorated,\nscullers seemed to sit on the water or surf over the\nwaves. Paul Jones fought hard, sinking; whilst\nGareth Brown battled on to take a silver medal in\nthe intermediate lightweight single. Harriet Cross\nwas extremely disappointed by the cancellation of\nthe women\u2019s beginner event, due to the adverse\nweather. The women\u2019s intermediate pairs suffered\nthe same fate. Medals were brought home by Imperial\u2019s female scullers, Mel Wilson won gold in the\nopen weight whilst Chloe Symmonds won bronze\nin the lightweight. Wilson made her heat and final\nlook easy, slicing through the horrendous water\nand the competition. Unfortunately, Josie Bowler\nwas not quite as lucky as she capsized in her intermediate lightweight heat and was not allowed to\ncomplete the race, much to her frustration.\nThe men\u2019s championship 8 (cox: Henry Fieldman/Matt Whaley/Rory Sullivan/Ben SpencerJones/Ali Hudson/Simon Steele/Henry Goodier/\nWilf Kimberley/Leo Carrington) added a bronze\nto the tally as they rowed through Queen\u2019s University Belfast and Durham in the closely fought\nfinal. Bronzes were also won by the men\u2019s champ\npair (Goodier/Spencer-Jones), men\u2019s champ\ncoxed four (cox: Libby Richards/ Steele/Goodier/\nSpencer-Jones/A Hudson) and the men\u2019s intermediate quad (Adam Seward/Danny Bellion/\nSpencer-Jones/Paul Jones).

The\nintention of the team was to be competitive at the big national tournaments and\nhave a good time doing it.\nThe name \u2018The PistolShrimps\u2019 originated from a Hydrostatics and Shocks\nlecture where the lecturer claimed that\nthese little shrimps with massive claws\naccelerated water out of their claws to\nstun and kill their prey.

A few white lies enabled the team\nto be entered under the title of \u2018Imperial\nCollege Old Boys\u2019. The first two group\ngames proved an excellent start of the\nseason, tough physical games against\nthe Esher Academy and Hammersmith\n& Fulham 1s saw the Shrimps smash\nboth opposition convincingly. The team\nwas playing some excellent sevens and it\nwas a shame the last group game and the\nquarters were against lesser opposition\nthat encouraged bad habits. The semi\nagainst the eventual winners Ruislip was\na hard fought and very physical affair.\nUnfortunately the shrimps lost their two\nmost experienced players to injury early\ndoors. Ruislip scored twice before we\nresponded. At 10-7 the game was ours to\nwin, but poor handling ruined a two man\noverlap which Ruislip capitalised on to\nrun in another try and put the game out\nof our reach.\nOllie Cox (Who incidentally\nwas asked on the day if he wanted to be an Abercrombie model\u2026\n#hangingoutthebackoftara) was awarded Shrimp of the tournament for his\nImperial ARCS return for a second year\nOn Friday the 10th of June, Sport Imperial will host its second annual awards\nand celebration event championing the\ncontribution that sports make to the university life of students of Imperial College.\nThere are a number of award categories for which people can be nominated\nfor; the event looks to reward those\nwho have made a sporting contribution for Imperial College and yet have\nremained under the radar and perhaps\nhave not received the recognition that\nthey deserve.\nOne of the most coveted prizes, the\nEthos Award, is awarded to an individual or group who are deemed to have\ncontributed positively to the fitness center based in South Kensington.\nThe evening\u2019s events will also include\na sports showcase, drinks reception and\nlight buffet.\nFor more information on the award\ncategories visit the Sport Imperial Website; today is the last day to nominate\npersonnel for the various awards whilst\ninformation on the award categories\nmay also be found on the Sport Imperial\nWebsite.\nFor further information on the event\nyou may contact Hannah Blandford via\nemail at h.blandford@imperial.ac.uk.\nWhy not follow Sport Imperial on\nFacebook and Twitter to keep ahead of\nthe game when it comes to forthcoming\nsports news and events regarding Imperial College.\nShrimps aim to become\nbig fish in the pond\nsuperb ability to make space and half\nbreaks throughout the day.

The proposal was branded as a\nchance for richer students to \u2018buy\u2019 their\nway into universities, though the government denies this.\nDavid Willetts proposed that universities could offer places for over-sea\nstudent prices, outside the government\nloans system. This was in response to\nthe burden on the government to pay out\na much larger proportion of money on\nloans due to the tuition costs.\nSo it seems that at this juncture in\nthe ongoing debate about higher edu-cation, it is simultaneously being suggested that students from lower financial backgrounds could risk everything\nfor cheaper fees and that rich students\ncould \u2018buy\u2019 their way into courses,\nwhich makes you wonder: what on earth\nis going on?\nform, guarantee the highest teaching\nstandards for next year.\nIn his President\u2019s Report to Union\nCouncil, Alex Kendall claims that the\nremoval of modules proposed by the\nreview is in conflict with promises made\nbyProfessorMargaretDallman,Principal\nof the Faculty of Natural Sciences, to\nthe July 2010 College Council that \u201cthe\nexperience of students in Life Sciences\nshould not be unduly affected by this\nrestructuring\u201d. He also pointed to a note\nsent by the Department of Life Science\nto the College Senate stating that the\nDepartment did \u201cnot anticipate that\nthe review [would] lead to a reduction\nin the contact hours or module choice\nexperienced by students.\u201d Given that\nDallman confirmed that the restructure\nwas \u201cprogressing according to plan\u201d to\nthe November 2010 Council, a week\nbefore the Life Science redundancies\nwere announced, Kendall alleged that\nDallman \u201cmisinformed [the Council] at\ntheir July meeting\u201d with regard to the\neffect of this plan on teaching.\nKendall\u2019s President\u2019s Report\nsuggested the Union \u201cmaking a formal\ncomplaint about the Restructure panel\u201d\nbut Kendall has since informed Felix\nthat he has been told that \u201cthere is\nno mechanism for students to make\nformal complaints about members of\nstaff\u201d.

The draft review document\npublished in March [1] proposed a\nreduction in the number of final year\nBiology and Biochemistry modules.\nAmong those to be cut were Animal\nBehaviour and all existing plant based\nmodules, though some new courses,\nincluding Pathogens and Mutualists,\nwere also introduced. The review\ndocument also suggested that Life\nSciences stop teaching Biomedical\nScience, a course run jointly by the\nDepartment of Life Sciences and the\nFaculty of Medicine. The draft review\nproposes withdrawing the course as\nsoon as October 2012, stating that\nit does not believe that \u201cteaching on\nthe Biomedical Science degree is an\noptimal use of our resources\u201d. The draft\nreview claims that the loss of the 50\nstudents who take Biomedical Science\neach year will allow an uptake of an\nadditional 24 people to the Biology\ndegree: \u201cideally those who express\norganismal/ecological, rather than\ncellular/biochemical, interests\u201d.\nProfessor Dallman told Felix that\nno long-term decision had been made\nyet regarding the Biomedical Science\ndegree and that such a decision would\nbe made in consultation with the Faculty\nof Medicine.\nThese issues were discussed at\nthe Science Studies Committee last\nTuesday. Deputy President (Education)\nAlex Dahinten said that the committee,\nwhich exists to maintain high teaching\nstandards, would not allow \u201canything\nsub-par to pass\u201d and that the ball was in\nthe Department\u2019s court. The committee\nhas given the Department until the 24th\nof May to answer their concerns.\n...Continued from Front Page\nIn brief\nNew Arabic course\nStudent Switch off\nImperial 10th in UK\naccording to Guardian\nThe Humanities Department have\nannounced that from October\n2011 it will offer a new non-cred-it Arabic course. They will offer\nclasses for beginners and level-2\nspeakers (equivalent to GCSE).\nStudents completing the courses\nwill accrue six ECTS credits.

In the\npast year,\ns t u d e n t s\nin Eastside\nhave reduced their energy use by\n5%, saving 16 tonnes of CO2. The\nenergy saving across Imperial\nhalls generally was 3%. The Student Switch Off is a not-for-profit\nnational campaign to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions\ninvolving 37 universities and almost 16,000 students.\nNSS participation rises\nThe number of students completing the National Student Survey\nat Imperial has increased by 7%\nthis year, marking the highest\nparticipation ever at Imperial.\nOverall 65% of students filled out\nthe survey, which is used as a\nmeasure of student satisfaction\nwith their university. Following\npoor NSS results in coursework\nfeedback last year, the Rector wrote to departments telling\nthem to make better coursework\nfeedback a top priority.\nThe Guardian has unveiled its\nuniversity league table for 2012,\nplacing Imperial 10th, down three\nplaces from last year. Cambridge\nhave taken the top spot from Oxford while Lancaster, Durham,\nand Loughborough all place\nahead of Imperial. Though Imperial scores poorly on several of\nmetrics, the table cites only 51%\nof students being satisfied with\nfeedback for example, it comes\nout top for career prospects, with\n83% of students in a career after\nsix months.\nCut-price degrees?\nIn a recent interview with The Independent, universities minister David Willetts announced that universities would\nbe able to offer lower fees to students\nwho are applying through clearing in\norder to fill their courses.\nAs if the idea of clearing isn\u2019t daunting\nenough for most university applicants,\nthe possibility of students from poorer\nbackgrounds holding off on university\nplaces in order to gain a cheaper course\nthrough clearing would definitely add to\nthe chaos and competitive desperation\nto gain those coveted university places.\nWith an estimated two thirds of universities raising their tuition fees to\n\u00a39,000, the fear of reducing fees for\nplaces through clearing is that able students who are willing to take the risk of\napplying through clearing may end up\nnot getting a place at all. Aaron Porter,\nthe president of National Union of Students told The Independent that clearing\nwould turn into a \u201cflea market\u201d for students trying to find the best deals.\nIt was also reported that universities\nmight offer other incentives such as\nfree iPads and Laptops to bribe students\ninto taking their courses. It is thought\nthat this plan would avoid the prospect\nof students on the same course paying\ndifferent fees which is a major fault in\nlowering fees in clearing.\nThe Office for Fair Access (Offa),\nhowever, who are in charge of regulating university tuition fees, are not in\nfavour of lowering tuition fees during\nclearing and have written to universities\nrequesting that they do not follow this\nroute.\nIn addition to this scheme, the government are still considering proposals\nAemun Reza\nWilletts suggests lower fees during clearing\nProfessor Dallman Alex Kendall\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 20 MAY 2011 2\nB O O K S\nFELIX 25\n\u201cNot just an imaginative\npiece of escapism; it is\nserious speculative fiction\u201d\nBooks Editor: Guo Heng Chin\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week I\u2019m going to discuss another Arthur C.\nClarke novel. This time, however, I\u2019m not just going to heap praise on my favourite author, for this\nis \u2018The City and the Stars\u2019, the first of Clarke\u2019s longer works that I didn\u2019t really like.\n\u201cThe City and the Stars\u201d is set in the distant fu-ture, after humanity has been deprived of its conquests in space by the mysterious \u2018invaders\u2019. Earth\nis reduced to a desert planet with a single remaining city: Diaspar. It is a technologically advanced\nbut stagnant society whose members have greatly\nexpanded lifetimes after which they are reborn in\nnew bodies in the \u2018Hall of Creation\u2019. They are all\ncontent to remain inside the city apart from Alvin,\nthe first person in thousands of years to emerge\nfrom the Hall of Creation who has not been reborn\nbut is rather a completely new person. The novel\nfollows his adventures as he manages to escape the\ncity and later even explore space.\nThe first few chapters, set in Diaspar, are admittedly very engaging, with the city and its society\nbeing meticulously described and forming a fascinating setting. Even more importantly, Alvin\u2019s desire to leave the city gives the story much needed\nfocus which is sadly missing in later chapters. After his escape, Alvin specifically states that he has\nno idea what his purpose should be and this is quite\nevident to the reader. He simply meanders between\nseveral weakly connected encounters, not really\nachieving anything until the end.\nEven then, when Alvin manages to persuade the\ninhabitants of Diaspar to overturn their policy of\nisolationism the reader has very little reason to\ncare. Diaspar is so far removed from our society\nthat it is very difficult for the reader to relate to\nit. This lack of a connection is amplified when we\nfind out that most of humanity has long left the\ngalaxy and that Diaspar has become a footnote in\nthe history of the human race. Most writers would\nhave compensated for this by making us focus\nour attention on the characters but Clarke\u2019s usual\npoor characterisation finally lets him down here.\nWe spend very little time with Alvin\u2019s friends and\ncompanions and even our main protagonist is very\nundeveloped, making it impossible to really care\nabout what happens to him. Clarke also seems to\nhave abandoned his hard SF roots. Instead of reasonable extrapolations of present day technology,\nthis story features faster-than-light travel, artificial\ngravity and Star Trek-like matter replicators. In a\nbetter story, this would have been hardly noticeable\nbut here it just adds insult to injury.\nThis is by no means a bad book. The first chapters are interesting and it is suffused with Clarke\u2019s\nusual optimism. Clarke\u2019s best novels, however, are\nhard SF set in the relatively near future where humanity has a specific challenge to overcome and\nthis, unfortunately, is nothing like that. If you want\na good Clarke novel read \u201cThe Fountains of Paradise\u201d, \u201cRendezvous with Rama\u201d or \u201cThe Songs of\nDistant Earth\u201d, not \u201cThe City and the Stars\u201d.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nBiopunk has always been considered a mere sub-genre. But recently things are beginning to change.\nAs genomics and biotechnology are becoming more\nintegral in our lives, there is more interest in biotech\nspeculative fiction. All biopunk needs is a landmark\nbook that lifts it from its \u2018sub-genre\u2019 label. Paolo\nBacigalupi\u2019s The Windup Girl, which recently became the latest recipient of the \u2018double crown\u2019 in\nscience fiction (refer to article by the side) might just\nbe the book that biopunk is looking for. It\u2019s quite\nsomething for a science fiction piece to be considered by TIME magazine to be a top 10 read of the\nyear.\nThe Windup Girl is Bacigalupi\u2019s debut novel,\nalthough he has established himself as a sci-fi\nshort story writer. The story is set in the near future where the exhaustion of fossil fuels led to a\n\u2018contraction\u2019 across the globe and climate change\nsubmerged major cities. Bio-engineered plagues\nravaged most of Earth\u2019s biodiversity and is a constant threat to crops and human life.\nBiotech mega corporations are the dominant\npower; they wield the brains and genetic resources\nto stay a step ahead in the dangerous genetic arms\nrace against the blister rust plague by continuously\ncreating new variants of blister rust-resistant crops\nand vaccines. Dubbed \u2018calorie companies\u2019 these\ncorporations are despised and yet they determine\nthe fate of nations with their crop seed monopoly.\nAnderson is an AgriGen economic hitman\nmasquerading as a kink-spring factory owner in\nBangkok (in the post-oil world, energy is stored\nin kinkily-names springs that function like a bat-tery). Anderson suspects that beneath the ingenuity\nof Thai gene-hackers, there lies a secret seed bank\nthat provides them with the necessary genetic materials to build new variants of resistant crops, and\nthe service of a rogue AgriGen gene-hacker. A fateful encounter with the alluring Emiko, a Windup\nGirl engineered for biological perfection would\nchange everything.\nThe plot is gripping and tight. Bacigalupi manage\nto introduce an intricately complex future Thailand\nwithout compromising plot pace. The diverse cast\nof characters keeps the book fresh from beginning\nto end. Kudos to Bacigalupi as well for breaking\nthe mould by setting a sci-fi story in a South East\nAsian country and for its eerily accurate portrayal\nof South East Asian politics and culture.\nThe Windup Girl is not just an imaginative piece\nof escapism; it is serious speculative fiction. It is a\nbiological Nineteen Eighty Four: where George Orwell reminds us of the value of political freedom,\nPaolo Bacigalupi reminds us of the Eden we are\nstewards of and are squandering at an alarming rate.\nThe book gains an Inception-like flavour for its\ninnovative \u2018gene-hacking\u2019 culture. Gene-hacking\nrequired intelligence and skill, and it\u2019s the monopoly of talent that allows the megacorporations\nto dominate. Genes of plants and animals are\n\u2018hacked\u2019 analogue to hacking a computer system\nto conjure new and intriguing variants of crops,\nfruits, animals and ultimately the creation of the\nNew People, who are superior in every way compared to us but are made sterile; a caricature of the\nsuperior GM seeds sold to farmers in developing\nworld which are made sterile.\nA \u2018biopunk\u2019 Nineteen Eighty-four\nGuo Heng Chin\nScience fiction owes its roots to the early classics\nlike Frankenstein, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and The Time Machine. The Golden\nAge of Science Fiction took place during the late\n30s to the 50s and was shaped by prolific masters\nlike Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K.\nDick and Robert Heinlein. Their stories adopt a\nspeculative theme and serve as a platform to discuss philosophical questions about society, technology etc. Though science fiction as a genre\ngained public attention, it is still very much considered pulp reads.\n\u201cWhen I was a kid....it [science fiction] was\nconsidered, like, total trash. Teachers would take\naway the books from me in school \u2013 this is Heinlein and Asimov they were taking away \u2013 and say,\nwell, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re reading, but you should\nread a real book, not this [stuff],\u201d said George R. R.\nMartin in an interview with the New York Times.\nGeorge R. R. Martin gained worldwide popularity\nas \u2018The American Tolkein\u2019for his high fantasy epic\nseries \u2018A Song of Ice and Fire\u2019 but first made his\nname in science fiction where his novella A Song\nfor Lya won him his first Hugo award.\nWhat is the \u2018Double Crown\u2019?\nThe Hugo and Nebula awards are the Oscars and\nPalme d\u2019Or (or Golden Globes, depending on how\nmuch value you place on the opinions of a small\ngroup of film critics). Once in a while, a novel\nscoops both the awards. Though not considered a\nrare feat as it happens on average once every three to\nfive years, books that are honoured with the double\ncrown are extraordinary. Check out some of them\nfor yourself: \u2018Dune\u2019 by Frank Herbert; \u2018Rendevous\nwith Rama\u2019 by Arthur C. Clarke; \u2018The Forever War\u2019\nby Joe Halderman; \u2018Neuromancer\u2019 by William Gibson; \u2018Ender\u2019s Game\u2019 by Orson Scott Card; \u2018American Gods\u2019by Neil Gaiman and of course \u2018The Windup Girl\u2019by Paolo Bacigalupi as reviewed on the left.\nScience Fiction today\nSci-fi is gaining more traction in mainstream literature today, though its still considered an alternative market by some and the thought of a science\nfiction piece winning the Booker prize is still an\noutlandish idea (at least until the current generation\nof Booker judges expire\u2026)\nHowever, in the recent years, a few authors in\nthe serious literary establishment (a.k.a. literary\nfiction) have toyed with science fiction as a legitimate theme in their writing. Kazuo Ishiguro used\nhuman cloning as the central theme in his 2005\nBooker-shortlisted Never Let Me Go, although\nthe science fiction element is acknowledged in a\nshy manner, akin to an embarrassing family mem-ber.\nDavid Mitchell\u2019s Cloud Atlas conspicuously\nflaunted its science fiction themes and it garnered\ntremendous praise from critics and is considered\none of his best works. Cloud Atlas was shortlisted\nfor the 2004 Booker prize. Perhaps the Booker\njudges are warming up to science fiction after all.\n\u201cThe borders between mainstream and genre fiction are getting hazy these days,\u201d quotes David in\na recent interview with Felix Books. \u201cAnd I think\nthat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\nGuo Heng Chin\nA flawed piece from the science fiction master?\nGene-hacking in a dystopian future\nThe Windup Girl is in some way a heir to Frank\nHerbert\u2019s Dune series, written during the dawn of\nthe environmental movement in the 60s. Dune\nwarns of the disruption of the ecological cycle that\nsustains the desert planet Arrakis due to the greed of\nthe people for more water. The Windup Girl warns\nus of the consequences of unbridled gene tempering\nand monopoly of genetic resources. Would Paolo\nBacigalupi\u2019s The Windup Girl be the herald of a bio-punk era the way William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer\nestablished cyberpunk? Only time will tell.\nClassic Sci-Fi: Arthur C.

Barely a year\nlater, in fact, Thomas Henry Huxley\nhad already pronounced the monumental project \u2018a failure\u2019. But when Rector\nSir Patrick Linstead decided to tear the\nbuilding down over half a century later,\nhe was met with public outrage. At the\ntime, it was reported that the decision\nto demolish the Institute was partly because its \u2018architecture would be \u201cdifficult to reconcile\u201d with the new science\nbuildings\u2019.\nAmong those not swayed by this line\nof reasoning was future Poet Laureate\nJohn Betjeman, a vocal campaigner for\nthe preservation of iconic British archi-tecture. Opposition to the plans grew as\nThe Times took up the cause to save the\nImperial Institute and its letters pages\nwere filled with denouncements of our\nuniversity\u2019s expansion. One commentator writing in the Country Life magazine\nsuggested that the Royal College of Music \u2013 in his opinion a fourth-rate building\n\u2013 be sacrificed in the Institute\u2019s place.\nThe sad future of the Victorian edifice was almost an inevitability, as it\nfell prey to financial trouble almost as\nsoon as construction finished. By 1899\nit had been taken over by the govern-ment, who promptly gave the University\nof London half of the building for use\nas administrative offices; they moved\nout again in 1936. In some ways, the\nInstitute was the Millennium Dome of\nits time; it contained a cinema, labora-tories, teaching facilities, conference\nfacilities, and hosted exhibitions. But by\nWorld War Two it had fallen from glory,\nwith the exhibition galleries \u2018desolate\nand deserted\u2019 and various government\nagencies haphazardly squatting there.\nPlans for the Insitute\u2019s demolition became public knowledge in 1956. The\nensuing debate resulted in a compromise leaving the Collcutt Tower, which\nis known today as the Queen\u2019s Tower,\nwould be retained. Not everyone was\nbest pleased by this, with an article in\nThe Engineer magazine declaring \u2018there\nis no logic about the retention of a useless tower\u2019 and wished for it to be unsta-ble: \u2018There is but one hope left. It is that\nupon examination the tower standing\nnakedly alone will prove to be unstable.\nWe hope so! We profoundly hope so!\u2019\nThe demolition began in 1957 with\nthe destruction of the rear galleries in\nthe east wing. In 1962 Imperial Institute\nRoad was closed to public traffic and\nby 1965 all but the Queen\u2019s Tower re-mained.\nOne man, Brigadier Arthur Fortescue\nof the Coldstream Guards, was so appalled by the act of vandalism that he\ndashed in and out of the demolition site\nrescuing \u201cbits of decorative stonework\u201d,\nas reported in the Evening Standard.\nWork on the tower\u2019s structural foundations began on the 14th of March\n1966. The tower was cleaned and a new\nlower balcony was added. The project\nwas finally completed in 1969, along\nwith the \u2018College Block\u2019 development\nwhich included the Central Library\nbuilding and the Great Hall.\nCourtesy of the Imperial College London Archives \u2013 Crown Journal, Issue 142, March/April 1966\nCourtesy of the Imperial College London Archives\nCourtesy of the Imperial College London Archives \u2013\nR.
