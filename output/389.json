Firstly,\nFELIX has never been produced twice a week, so in some\nrespects the two-a week program can be considered as an\nexperimental pilot scheme just to see if it can be done\nsingle-handed by one person. The answer at the moment\nappears to be 'yes it can be done'.\nSecondly, it can be stated categorically that with all\nthe FELIX staff now studying furiously for exams (they\nhurt not only the students who are studying for them) it\nwould be physically impossible for me to single-handedly\nproduce an eight (or more) page FELIX simply because of\nprocess of finishing called 'collation'. This is where one\nputs one sheet of FELIX into another to produce the\nfinished article. It would take me in excess of six hours\nsolid to fold, collate, count and stack the 2,200 copies of\nFELIX which are produced'. Sabbatical I may be,Superman\nI am not'.\n\"What are you going to do after your year as Editor?\"\nIt is strange the number of people who believe that my\nyear as Editor is being used as a stepping-stone into the\nmetastable world of journalism. Nothing could be further\nfrom the truth. In September I shall be here at IC commencing studies leading to a PhD in one of the specialised\nareas of polymer chemistry.\nI hope this satisfies everyone's semi- morbid curiosity.\nFELIX. Newspaper of Imperial Michael J. L. Williams\nCollege Union Editor\nPublished by the Editor on behalf of the\nImperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted Offset-litho on the Union premises.\nThanks to Gill, Ian, John.\nFELIX Office, IC Union, Telephone: Int. 2881\nPrince Consort Ftd, London 01/5895111 Ext.2166\nSW7 2BB. \u00a9 1975\nLETTER\nBENN AND THE EEC Imperial College\nI Oth May, 1975\nDear Sir,\nI fee i1 must bring to your\nattention the hypocrisy of the\nex-her editor y peer and anti market e er, Mr Benn .\nFollowing an anti-European\nspeech at Bristol University,\nhe called for a show of hands\non whe the r or not Bri ta in s hould\nremain in the EEC. As at IC, the vote was massively in favour of our continued mem-ber ship, showing that, whatever\nrid i cul our arguments such\nanti-market e ers bring up, common sena c( which the Lefti\nLike to call 'ignorance') can prevail. Mr Benn's reply was,\n\" 7 think that shows something\nof the social origins of\nuniversity students .\" Undoubtedly Bristol, with a medical\nschool of some note, attracts a fair proportion of'middle class' students, but the implication\nthat there exists a class barrier between those who will vote yes and no in the coming\nreferendum is a myth typical of Mr Benn, a politician who\nthrives on strife .\nPersonally I have several\nreasons for opposing the\nextremes of right and left on\nthe EEC issue. First and\nforemost comes my future job\nsecurity, which will depend;\ndirectly or indirectly, on the\nsuccess of private enterprise .\nWhile there is much criticism of the ' multinationals', the\nmassive inflation and recession\nfollowing EEC withdrawal\nwould undoubtedly reduce such\ncompanies graduate in take. Secondly, why have three\nsuccessive governments under\nMacmillan, Wilson and Heath\nfound the necessity to apply\nfor EEC membership? It\nappears that throughout the\nsixties our trade with western\nEurope and particularly the\nsix increased, with a corresponding decrease in trade with\nthe Commonwealth. Now that\nwe are in the market, without\nthe tariffs of the last decade,\nand commonwealth countries\nhave found other markets,\nwithdrawal would be very\nserious. Also, there is the\nmuch talked of issue of\nsovereign it y. While the\n' internationalists' on the\nLeft want us to reinforce our\nnational barriers and complain\nof a loss of sovereign it y to\nBrussels, the mere fact that we\nare holding a referendum shows\nthat we have the final choice. Finally, vote yes on June\n5th \u2014 the result of a no vote,\npolitically and economically,\non Britain' s future, will be\ndisastrous. Yours faithfully\nFrancis To ye PS Bring back the eight-page\nFELIX... please!\nPiG\nAFFAIRS Tom Abraham\nTHIS IS the last 'PiG Affairs Corner' from me. My retirement\ndate is fast approaching and my successor, who will be elected\nat the AGM on the 15th May, will decide whether or not to continue having a regular column in FELIX. My personal opinion is that\nit is alright provided there are more contributions from rank and\nfileR G's. The meeting on May 15th should hopefully mark a high\npoint in PG affairs. First there will be reports from the\nprincipal officers, John Porter\nand myself. John will tell you\nwhat we have done with our\nmoney, how much we have\nleft and what we intend doing\nwith the remainder. Is hall give an account of my activities during the past year, including\nthe full truth behind the\n\"PGAO on the exec?\" saga. We hope to follow this with\nan important debate on the\nstatus of PG' s \u2014 whether we\nshould be treated as research\nworkers and be paid a reasonable wage or whether we should\nremain as students. There are\nadvantages and disadvantages\nin both but on balance I feel\nthat being classed as 'research\nworkers' would be better. This is, and I would like to stress\nthis point, part of a national\ndebate going on among post-graduates and college authorities about PG research\nwork. As an example, Leeds\nUniversity Senate have\nproposed a model whereby\npostgraduates would be\nemployed as' research assistants' and given six years in which to produce a Ph.D thesis \u2014 ie actually\ncontribute towards the\nextension of the frontiers of\nknowledge.\nShould the motion on the\nstatus of PG' s be passed,\nthere will have to be immediate\naction on one of the principal\ndemands, which is that all\" tuition\" fees for postgraduate\nresearch students be abolished.\nThere is also an important\nmotion to be introduced by\nRichard Upton dealing with\nthe relationship between the\nPG group and College as well\nas with the Union. At the\nmoment our powers are not\nclearly defined. I feel that\nICPGG should demand complete\npolicy-making control over PG\naffairs and ask that ICU and\nthe College recognise our new\nrole.\nI hope as many of you as possible will try to come to\nthe AGM in Ele c Eng407 at\n1pm on Thursday May 15th. The points to be discussed are\nvery fun de mental in nature and\nsince it affects every single\npost grad in College, it is in\nyour interest to try and attend\nthis meeting.\nBLOOD DON ING\nON WEDNESDAY, Thursday and Friday of this week a team\nfrom the South London Blood Transfusion Centre will be vis i ting the College in a further attempt to extract blood from\nstudents. The details of the session may be found elsewhere\nin this issue and dotted around the College, so I will not repeat\nthem here, except to emphasise for the sake of old hands (or\narms!) that the venue has changed from the Union Concert Hall to Southside Lower Refectory. The change is due, not to a nefarious Mooney plot, but to a Dramsoc super-epic on the days\nin question.\nIn this article I merely want to point out the urgent and\ncontinuing necessity for blood in our hospitals, and to attempt\nto put paid to some of the myths, half-truths and old wives'\ntales that people trot out when seeking to justify their refusal\nto give blood.\nFirstly the need for blood is urgent. A large proportion of\nthe blood taken during a session is delivered to the hospitals\nthe same day, and never even sees a blood bank. Blood is usable for up to three or four weeks after donation and the\nsmall percentage that reaches this age is not wasted, but turned\ninto plasma which will keep indefinitely. So NO blood is wasted.\nSecondly, It doesn't hurt, honest, folks. You merely feel a pin-prick in the arm, and that's it. The blood removed, which\namounts to roughly% of a pint is replaced within a few hours\nand you' ll never know it was missing. It is true that people\nhave been known to feel faint or dizzy after giving blood, but\nin the main this is more psychological than physical. Thirdly, it does not take a long time. At most the whole\nprocess takes 40 minutes, and typically you can be away in\nhalf an hour - including tea and biscuits. In conclusion, I would just like to urge you all to be public spirited next week and give freely of your corpuscles, you\nnever know when the compliment may have to be returned.\nIan McWalter\n\n"

The festival, organised by the\nlocal athletics club, spans the Easter week-end, as well as a vast array of running talent,\nas can be judged from the\nresults of the 4 mile road race\non Good Friday evening.\nThe early pace was fast,\nuntil 3V4 miles when a brute of\nhill brought most mortals to a shuddering halt. Overcoming\nthis obstacle with much aplomb, Charly All in son led the 1st team home in 63rd in 22:45,\nfollowed by the fast finishing\nspeedy Steve Webb and an HW\nrecruit, Stuart Littlewood. Granny Clarke closed in for\nthe first team in 102, to place\nthe first team 22nd out of 36 .\nThe second and third teams\nwere somewhat unnerved by\nthis hill, finishing a humble\n33rd and 36th respectively.\nThe hard surface did Tractor\nHoulbrooke a disservice, and\nowing to half shaft trouble, he\nwas unable to raise sufficient\nengine power-'to take part in\nthe next 2 races. Rob Maddison,\nreturning from a year's absence\nin the depth of Pless ey, ambled home in 165th, convincingly last by over 2 mins.\nThe evening passed peacefully,\nuntil a re-enactment of the\nBattle of Culloden Moor; (the\nScots being Edinburgh Zoo, sharing the same hotel as us)\u2014\nButcherCumberland was played\nby Steve Webb.\nNext morning passed\nrestfully, after we had polite! y turned down offers of training\nruns of 15 miles and more,\nfrom the energetic Scots: we\nthought the rest would enable\nus to beat them in the 4 x3 miles road relay the same\nafternoon . Our hopes were\nforlorn, though, in spite of an\nexcellent team performance by\nthe 1st team, finishing 16th, and beaten by both Edinburgh\nZoo' A' and ' B' teams .

Drunkard (sic) of\nEdinburgh Zoo: consuming at\nleast 2 cans of ale en route,\nhe sped round in 26.37, a mere\n11 mins outside the lap record.\nSaturday's festivities were\nsomewhat limited, in view of\nthe fact that the now famous\nbeer-drinking competition was\nto be held next day. However,\nthis did not prevent Ian Isherwood from nearly getting\narrested trying to feed chips to a policeman's dog; the Hair\nArtist and Wilf were also seen\ndoing weird things with wind screen wipers. Later that\nevening, Stuart, after 11 pints\nand chicken and chips, was\nobliged to deposit a solid excess in the sink: amazingly,\nthis was the only ' spillage' of\nthe week-end.\nIf Sunday's fell race was\nmeant to sort out the men from\nthe boys, then most of us\nshould still be in our cots. Proving the exception to the\nrule was Charly All in son, undeterred by the gradients,\nleading us home in 63rd again. Just behind was Granny,\nbeating speedy Steve into 76th. However, our next man home\nwas a real dark horse (and\npale, more often than not) as\nthe rest of the 1 st team stood\nin astonishment watching Ian\nIsherwood romp home in 87th to be the final scorer for the\nfirst team.\nThe second and third teams\nwere evenly distributed in the\nfinal50. Mr Johns on,stimulated\nby the presence of his wife at\nthe top of the fell, beat Wilf\nagain; Pad and Rob Maddison\nwere credited with equal last. Several of us ran the 6 miles\nback to Douglas, partaking in\nthe first drinking session of\nthe day en route.\nThe serious drinking was\nreserved for later that day .The\nfirst team of Pad, Tractor,\nWilf and Stuart won the first\nround by a huge margin:\nunfortunately, in the second\nround, we encountered Ed in burgh Zoo and Rossendale, the\neventual finalists, and we\nwere unable to open our gullets\nthe extra inch to beat them,\nfailing by a few seconds. Protests of spillage fell on\ndeaf ears, so we were left to\nsup at a more sedate rate. The\nsecond team of CH Under (sic\n(k)), Hair Artist, Andy Davey\nand Charly All in son performed\ncreditably on their debut, just\nknocked out in the first round.\nThe return to Liverpool\nnext day was fortunately calm,\nthough several stayed on to\nsurvey the island. A Ithough not\nquite as eventful as previous\nyears, we were certainly\nstronger in the running department than in the past couple of\nyears, and hope to continue\nthis trend at next year's festival.

The debate was, on the whole,characterised\nby a distinct lack of knowledge about the issues involved'.\nIC RAG OR NOT? AFTER AN extremely\nsuccessful year collecting a massive \u00a38,500 for charity, the\nIC Rag Committee has decided\nthat it wants a new name.\nOne suggestion put forward\nwas that of LIMP (\"London,\nImperial) Rag, with a crutch\nas its symbol, but since this\nmight cause offence to certain\ncharities, the Rag committee\ndecided against it. Now, a competition has\nbeen initiated for the purpose\nof finding a new name. The\nprize is to be a bottle of whisky\nand all suggestions for the\nnew name should be sent to:-Ra g,IC Union Office, on or\nbefore Wednesday 28th May. All suggestions will be\nwelcomed.\nThe main motion was introduced by Terence Pye. This was immediately followed\nby a 'delete all and insert'\namendment by ICU President\nTrevor Phillips. He spoke at\nlength on the undemocratic\nnature of the Common Market\ninstitutions, and asserted that\nthe powers of decision making\nwould be removed from the\nelected representatives and placed in the hands of the\nBrussels bureaucracy. This was followed by speeches for\nand against the amendment,\nwith the main speeches\nagainst' concentrating on the\ntheme that \"we are already in\nEurope and we would lose far\nmore if we got Out than stayed\nin.\" The speeches against\nwere similar to Trev Phillips' proposal speech except that\nmore details were added to\nback up the arguments that had\nalready been stated. This More on Hamlet Gardens FURTHER TO the story on\nHamlet Gardens (front page,\nFELIX No.387), the IC Union Exec have come to a decision\nregarding the composition of\nthe committee for selecting new applicants.\nIt will consist of the\nPresident, the Hon. Secretary,\nthe Warden and one of the Subwardens of the head tenancy\nscheme.\n20% of the places will be\ngoing to re-applicants and the\nremainder will go to new applicants. The Warden is to\nhave the same powers of selection\nof re-applicants as the other\nwardens.\nAdditionally, it was further\ndisclosed that the selection\ncommittee is to give preference\nto married students where both\nparties are IC students. There\nis also to be approximately the\nsame percentage of places going\nto each group (second-years,\nthird-years, PG' s) as there are\napplicants in each group.\n\u2022 See page 3\nbrought a riposte from the\nR SMU President, JohnMortiner,\nwho asked the House not to be\ntaken in by these ' details'. He\nwent on to defend Britain' s membership and concluded\nthat we are better off staying\nin. Trev Phillips in summing\nup accused John Mortimer of\nusing \" cheap debating points.\"\nThe amendment was then put\nto the House and defeated.\nA second amendment was\nthen presented which stated\nthat ICU should not take a definite stand on the issue, and that each student should\nnot take a definite stand on\nthe issue, and that each\nstudent should be left to\nhimself (or herself) to decide\nwhich way to vote. This amendment was also defeated\nwhereupon the debate on the\nsubstantive was resumed. Then\nwere further speeches on the\nmotion with the most notable\none coming from the PG Affairs\nOfficer, Tom Abraham in which\nhe broke with his left-wing\ncolleagues by coming out in favour of EEC membership.\nCountering these arguments\nMr Phillips described Mr\nAbraham's points as \"Trot-sl cy is t tripe\". The motion was\nthen voted upon in parts, the\nsection dealing with the\npublic ising of ICU's position\n(by writing to Fleet Street\npapers etc) being taken\nseparately. Both parts were\npassed. A plea that such a small meeting should not\nmandate its officers to publicise the opinions expressed in the\nmotion of being those of ICU was ignored.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3 \"Hamlet Gardens Shock\"\nFURTHER TO our front-page lead of the same name last Friday (FELIX No.387), DAVE SALISBURY, the\nIC Union Student Residence Officer, has written this article in reply.\nI HOPE to write an answer to the\nart ic le on Hamlet Gardens which appeared\nin the issue of FELIX dated 2nd May. The headline has a sub-title of \"Clique\"\nPerpetuation\" A Negations Made. I have\nfound that one dictionary defines clique\nas an associated number of persons or\nan exclusive set. The second meaning is\nnearer that usually meant at IC. This is\nthat it is a small number of students who\nwish to exclude any other students they\ndo not want with them, lam informed by\nthe Warden of Hamlet Gardens that those\nstudents in the flats during the session73/74 and who wished to remain for\nsession74/75 were able to remain in the\nflats. In one way it may be interpreting\nthe word clique liberally, in that it\nexcludes some new applicants. However\nit hardly lives up to the sensational\nheadline of the article: there is not a small band of students living in Hamlet\nand Cambridge Gardens eternally.\".. Jhere is not a small band of\nstudents living in Hamlet and\nCambridge Gardens eternally.\"\nI was accused of setting up a clique\nin the second paragraph by trying to\nallow re applicants to remain in residence\nfor next year. If this is so then the\nre applicants who were successful last\nyear are also a clique, similarly the year\nbefore etc. The third paragraph points out that\nTrev Phillips questioned my stance on\nthe issue of Hamlet Gardens . First my\nstance on Hamlet Gardens, which was presented at Council on Monday 28th April.1 proposed two motions, the first\nbeing that the re applicants for the session75/76 be allowed places, the second\nmotion was that the exec 75/76, Student\nResidence Officer 75/76, and Warden of\nHamlet Gardens 75/76 should meet to\nconsider formulating any rules and\nregulations which may subsequently\na pertain to Hamlet Gardens and Cambridge\nGardens.\n\"Jacqui Gerrard then agreed with the\narticle as a whole saying that she\nthought it was okay.\"\nMy reasons for these proposals are\nas follows. During last term Jacqui\nGerrard asked if I would write an article\nto appear in FELIX which would explain\nthe situation with regard to who is able\nto live in Halls, Houses and Flats. This explained the various quotas, eg.12% re applicants,18% PG' s etc. in Hall/ Houses. The paragraph dealing with the\nFlats was reasonably vague as there did not appear to be many firm ru les . You may\nremember the sentence \"// Is policy that\nstudents wishing to have a second year\nin the flats have first choice of which flat\nand get priority over first time app li cants.\" I wrote a draft copy of the\narticle which Jacqui Gerrard, Ann Henley,\n(Residence Clerk at the time), Shaun\nCrofton (Warden)and MrSeaford (Domestic\nBursar) all read. Jacqui Gerrard objected\nto the words \"Union policy\" in the above\nsentence which appeared in the draft. I changed this by dropping the word \"Union\"\nalong with other minor corrections into a second draft which had the sentence\nas above. Jacqui Gerrard then agreed\nwith the article as a whole saying that\nshe thought it was okay.\nThe article appeared on Monday\n( FELIX was late that Issue) 10th March.\nClosing date for applications was21 st March - less than two weeks later. I therefore assume that students reading\nthis article take it as being truthful - as I did. Now Trev Phillips and Jacqui Gerrard are effectively saying this is not\nto be so. But when did they say so? Not\na month or so before closing date but a matter of days before closing date. No\npublic notice of this appeared in FELIX until the article presenting a biased view\nappeared. Any changes in the method of\nselection should be made public a month\nin advance at least.\n\"Any changes in the method of\nselection should be made public a month in advance at least.\"\nThis time factor is my main reason for\nthe first proposal I put to Council, which\nwas defeated by a narrow margin. Next Is\nthat instead of re applicants being notified before or about the end of the Easter vacation and new applicants notified soon\nafter we have the situation where the\nforms (266 for 146 places) have not been\nsorted through. This is a drop in the\nstandard of service for some students\nthat is not to be tolerated.\n\"This is a drop in the standard of\nservice some students that is not to\nbe tolerated.\"\nI obtained two lists of residents of\nthe Flats relating to the sessions73/74 and 74/75. No list is available for the\nprevious years 71/72 and 72/73. Upon\nsorting through these lists I have found\nthat less than 3 0 % of the places are\noccupied by re applicants, not small enough to be a clique but not big enough\nto be \"the same old clique'that gets in\nyear after year\" that will not allow any\nnew applicants is it? Some students may\nremember the circumstances surrounding\nthe setting up of a Warden . He was to be\nan administrator and to keep a more\nrig our o us control of discipline as there\nhad been a large number of complaints\nfrom the neighbours. Having been a member of the Student Hall Committee I hope I am not misrepresenting Hall Wardens by saying that they do not wish to have a very large proportion of freshmen because they consider the Halls then\nlack discipline. I feel consequently\nthat the Flats need re applicants who are\nhopefully going to exercise some self-control.\nAgain in the third paragraph of the\narticle Trev Phillips is reported as\ncondemning the action being taken over\nHamlet Gardens \"which directly contradicts Union policy\" to quote the article. In my copy of the Union policy document\nwhich a Union meeting will be asked to\nratify as true, there is no mention of\nHamlet Gardens Cambridge Gardens, Head\ntenancy flats, Union Flats or any other\nname under which they may appear. So\nthe article is wrong there and the only\naction so far taken over Hamlet Gardens\nis to suspend the selection of applicants\nwhich Trev has done. The matter of\nHamlet Gardens has been discussed at\nsome exec meetings but no firm action has\nbeen decided on selection policy as far\nas I know.\" I feel... that the Flats need re applicants who are hopefully going\nto exercise some self-control.\"\nA brief resume then of why Ido not\nagree with what has happened/ is\nhappening/ is not happening over the\nFlats:1. My article of 10th March about Student\nResidence .\n2 . The intervention of Trevor Phi Hips and\nJacqui Gerrard only after this article had\nbeen published whilst Jacqui Gerrard\nhad seen the article before it went to\nFELIX and had okayed it.\n3 . That any decision now reached means\nthere has been a time delay for applicants\n\u2014 a drop in the standard of service.4. Present occupants at the beginning of\nthe year (perhaps) knew that they would\nbe able to remain in the Flats now find\nthat they may not necessarily be able to\ndo so but on jy just before the closing date for applications. The above hopefully gives a true\nindication of what is happening at Hamlet\nGardens and should correct what was an\nerroneous and misleading article. What\nmore can I say? (A part from petty bitching).\nREVIEW\nFILM Tommy (Director Ken Russell)\nIN THE film version of Pete Townshend and the Who's Rock Opera \"Tommy\",\nKen Russell' s strong, weird images react\nnegatively, for the most part, with the\nmusic. Only in one or two scenes did what was happening on the screen add to\nthe power of the second track.\nMany of Russell' s images were clever\nand had something to say, many were not\nand had not,and almost without exception\nthey all failed to find sufficient relevance\nto the music and lyrics. This was not\naided by Ann-Margret (Tommy's Mother)\nand Oliver Reed (her lover) who, while\nlooking good and acting well, respect-iv ely, cannot sing. Can someone explain\nthe relevance of Ann-Margret swimming\nin six inches of baked beans which have\nspewed from a smashed TV? The two extra numbers written in by\nPete Townshend, to add some extra\ncontinuity, are not up to the standard of\nthe other songs.\nThe two places where I felt the\nvisuals complemented the music where\nin \"Amasing Journey\" and \"Eyesight to\nthe Blind\". They just failed to do so in\n\"Acid Queen\" which was pushed a little\ntoo far.\nGuest Artist summary: Elton John as the \" Pinball Wizard\" \u2014 good enough;\nTina Turner as the \" Acid Queen\" \u2014 a touch overdone; Jack Nicholson as the\ndoctor, Eric Clapton as the preacher,\nRobert Powell as Tommy's Father, and\nKeith Moon as Uncle Ernie \u2014 superb,\ngreat laugh.\nRoger Da I trey does well as Tommy,\nhe's had seven years practice. If you' ll take my advice \u2014 you' ll buy the original\nWho album, settle back in your head-phones, close your eyes, and while away\n111 minutes that way. But if you like\nyour mind crushed\n\n"
