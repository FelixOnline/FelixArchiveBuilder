To any\nmoron with half an iota of intelligence\nit is clear that IC has priced itself out\nof the market. How many potential\nstudents will not consider going to a London College because they have no\nmoney left to spend after paying their\nrent bill? And they wonder why the\napplications are falling!\nWelfare Adviser\nThere's a movement growing in the\nUnion which would like to see a new\nWelfare Adviser appointed and placed\nin the Union Building as a Union\nservice.

The Oaks on Saturday saw a class\nhorse win in style. The favourite\nDimimendo came home by six lengths\nto defeat the late run of Sudden Love\nto give the Epsom crowds a treat. He\nwas always in the front crowd and on\nturning Tattenham Corner, left the\ncrowd and headed for home. No other\nhorse had a chance from this point.\nSudden Love went with him but\ncouldn't find the pace of the champion\nand was clear second in front of the\nwell finis ning FrenchfillyAnamasce.\nThe other big news in racing was\nthe announcement that champion\njockey Lester Piggot is to be stripped\nof his OBE. Piggot. who is serving\na three year sentence for tax evasion,\nwas awarded the honour in 1975 after\nriding his twentieth classic winner.\nDowning Street said of the incident:\n'It is quite usual in cases where an\nhonoured person is jailed.' Piggott is\nsaid to be very upset at the news.\nOn a brighter note, the first rounds of the greyhound derby have now\nbeen run, and among the highlights\nwere the impressive victories of Sam\nBridge. Carrinberry and Stake\nWhisper. I am. however, sticking\nwith Killoughreigh Chris, who,\ndespite badly bruising a toe in his heat\non Saturday, still ran to gain third\nplace and an entry into round two.\nThis only goes to show his class. He\nis now 50-1 and this is a great chance\nfor a big win.\nOther highlights of the week\nby Martin Peck\ninclude the five length victory of\nSamhaan at Yarmouth on Tuesday,\nand he looks set to run in the\nBessborough Handicap at Royal\nAscot next week. There he will meet\nQannaas. one of Tom Jones' horses,\nwho won recently at Sandown. Jones\nwill also run lna ad in the Royal Hunt\nCup. Habub in the King George and\nAl Mych in the Sussex Stakes. The\nlatter ran poorly in the Derby but is\nexpected to run well in this race.\nThe big races at Ascot are the\nQueen Anne Stakes, the Gold Cup\nand the Coronation Stakes all of\nwhich look like being fantastic races.\nThe Queen Anne has last year's Sussex winner Soviet Star facing the\nRogers Gold Cup second, Fair\nJudgement with the French Champion\nAndre Fabre also in with a chance.\nMeanwhile Wednesday's Coronation\nStakes will see One Thousand\nGuineas winner Ravinella back in\nAction, but facing tough opposition\nfrom Irish One Thousand Guineas\nthird Trusted Partner. The best\ncompetition promises to be the Ascot\nGold Cup on Thursday. France will\nhope for victory with Royal Gait and\nSalco looking very strong, but they\nare faced with the might of recent\nwinner El Conquestador, who will\nalso run with stable mate Sadeem as\na pacemaker.

Also, I would\nlike to know how he can have the nerve to sign a letter\nof this sort to someone he has never even talked to 'yours\nsincerely'. Perhaps, he would like to reply.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Haisley, DoC 3\nPS. Whenever I have used the FELIX Office for\nproduction of publicity for Jazz & Rock Club, I have\nalways found you and your staff very helpful\u2014despite\nwhat anyone else may say to the contrary.\nDear Judith,\nLast Monday (30th May) a charming letter demanding\nthree hundred and four pounds rent for a stay in 54 Lexham\nGardens over last summer arrived in my pigeonhole\n(actually, it could have arrived there any time in the\nprevious week as I am on an industrial placement at the\nmoment and only came in to College to push a piece of\ncoursework under the relevant door). The letter stated 'In\n;>hort, your final degree result will be withheld unless this\nmatter is resolved by the 27th May'. This, you might think,\nwas a reasonable response to non-payment of a year old\nbill. The problem with it was that I never actually stayed\nin Lexham Gardens (although I would have quite liked\nto). What actually happens makes an interesting story.\nAbout this time last year I applied for a place in College\nresidence over the summer along with a friend. Two days\nbefore the end of term, I was sent a rejection letter and,\nas I was supposed to be starting a vacation job the\nfollowing week, I immediately went and arranged\nalternative accommodation. I was quite surprised then,\nwhen a bill for the accommodation arrived in my\npigeonhole four days later. I sent the bill back, along with\nthe rejection note and a snotty letter suggesting that the\naccommodation office got itself in order and left the matter\nat that.\nNow, almost a year later, the said mentioned letter has\narrived. On Tuesday morning, I telephoned Dave Parry\n(who was very helpful) and it took him five minutes to\nlook through the relevant files and find that I had not\nactually stayed in Lexham Gardens.\nThere are several reasons why I am not at all happy\nwith this gro tty treatment by the College.\nThe first complaint I have is that, when the supposed\nbill has been unpaid for almost a year, why is it that the\nfirst communication that was made with me over the matter\nis a letter threatening to stop my degree.\nThe second is that why didn't Mr Malcolm Aldridge\n(in whose name the letter was written), or whoever was\nresponsible for the letter, get off his backside and go and\nsee Dave Parry before issuing it. It does, after all, seem\nto be quite a serious matter threatening to stop someone's degree. This simple action would not only have saved me\nhassle but saved the College a considerable amount of time\nand money\u2014as the Registrar, Senior Tutor and other\npeople have to be informed and the registry has to be\ninstructed to withhold exam results the saving would seem\nto be not insignificant.\nMy final complaint is that Aldridge did not even bother\nto find out what course I was on, or for that matter to\ncontact my personal tutor, or else he would not have\nwritten 'as this is the final part of your course' when in\nfact it is the industrial placement period at the end of the\nthird year of a four year course. As a result of this, I did\nnot even receive the letter until after the deadline for\npayment stated within it (a copy was sent to my home\naddress but, as it was postmarked after the deadline, I can\nonly assume that it must have been delayed by the Post\nOffice\u2014ha ha).\nIn conclusion, I would like to suggest to Aldridge that,\nbefore he puts his name to threatening letters in the future,\nBean's Club record\nnew statement\nDear Judith\nWe are wilting to put the record straight regarding\nBean's Club and the membership's involvement in IC\nUnion this year.\nBean's Club is an apolitical group with no corporate\nviews. The opinions expressed by members of Bean's Club\nare expressed as individuals alone and are not\nrepresentative of the body of the Club as a whole.\nWe hope that this clears up any misunderstandings that\nhave arisen lately.\nYours etc,\nThe Bean's Club Executive Committee.\nAnother stinging\nletter of complaint\nDear Judith,\nI am writing to complain about last week's cookery\ncolumn. Yishu Nanda's Rogan Josh recipe was, in fact,\nstolen from me. I lent it to Mr Nanda, completely unaware\nthat he intended to print it. Unless an apology and a full\nretraction are both printed, I shall be forced to sue both\nyourself and 'Holbein House's least favourite heartthrob'.\nMadam, I shall see you in court.\nYours angrily,\nPaul Shanley (Mrs).\nPS. Do I get five pounds?\nThis headline is\nbigger than the letter\nDear Judith,\nI speak as someone who is sick and tired of all this petty\nbickering between FELIX and the Union, I think it is about\ntime you stopped publishing anonymous letters and\ncontributions written under pseudonyms.\nYours faithfully,\nName withheld by request.\nFELIX Friday 10th June 1988 11\n\n"

    "content": "lew s Suspect (Cert 15)\nJustice Lowell has blown his brains\nout with a shot gun. Elizabeth Quinn,\na secretary in the Justice Department,\nis found floating in the Potomac. Are\nthe crimes related? Who can we pin\nthem on before Christmas comes to\nWashington DC?\nThe most likely candidate is a Vietnam veteran, Carl Anderson\n(Liam Neeson, A Prayer for the\nDying), who is almost superficially\ncharged and locked up. Enter Cher\n(Moonstruck, Silkwood) as public\ndefender Kathleen Riley, appointed as\nthe obligatory non-committal\nattorney. Good attorneys are not noncommittal though, and Cher doesn't let us down.\nNext to join in is Judge Helms,\nplayed by John Mahoney. His\nproblem is that he has no time for this\ncase and makes it quite obvious that\nhe thinks Anderson is guilty and\nought t& be fried for the murder. Or\nperhaps that is Anderson's problem.\nIt certainly isn't his only one though,\nbecause he is also deaf and dumb,\nwhich makes defending him very\ndifficult.\nThere is only one thing standing in\nthe way of a quick guilty verdict, and\nthat is Dennis Quaid (Innerspace). He\nplays Eddie Sanger, a lobbyist from\nCapitol Hill, and one of the jury\nmembers. Sanger turns detective and\nbegins hunting out evidence to prove\nAnderson's innocence, passing it on\nto Riley, and thereby breaking the\nlaw.\nWhy should he do this? Well I couldn't work it out. Sanger mutters\nsomething about conscience but gives\nno real explanation. It makes the plot\na little thicker if nothing else, and puts\nthe tiniest amount of tension in what\nwould otherwise be a fairly tedious\naffair.\nThe trial continues, or rather it\ndrags a bit, but eventually we reach\nthe end and suddenly the twist in the\ntale jumps out. I was certainly caught\nby surprise, even though it stands out\nlike a sore thumb in retrospect.\nSuspect is not a bad film, but it ist, i quite complete in many respects.\nPerhaps the best way to describe it is\n'an almost movie'. It tries to do a lot\nof things but never quite manages any\nof them.\nAs a thriller, the only element\nwhich is missing is the thrill, which\nis fairly essential. As a vehicle for\nCher, well, Moonstruck is streets\nahead there. As a banner for social\nstatement\u2014Vietnam and the\nhomeless, the fundamental failures of\nthe American Dream\u2014the movie runs\nout of steam there, since in every case\nthe point is briefly mentioned and\nquickly forgotten.\nDespite this failure to fulfill its\nquota of movie requirements Suspect\ndoes have enough addictive ness to\nhold attention and keep you\nwondering just what is actually going\non. Perhaps that's what really counts.\nIf you just want to watch Cher, then\ngo and see Moonstruck. If it's Dennis\nQuaid you like then Innerspace\nshould be out on video by now. And\nif you only want to see a thriller, No\nWay Out and Someone to Watch Over\nMe are still around, and far superior.\nIf you've done all that and you just\nwant to escape exams, and you don't expect too much, well Suspect is on\nin the West End now, and is just about\nworth seeing.\nAndrew Clarke.\nBright Lights, Big City\n(Cert 18}\nBright Lights, Big City is based on a Jay Mclnvernay novel, and stars\nMichael J Fox, who acts quite well,\nproving he has, at last graduated from\nthe Brat Pack 'trashy' film set.\nFox plays Jamie Conway, who\nworks for the prestigious New York\n'Gotham Magazine', in the\ndepartment of Factual Verification,\nunder the eagle-eye of ever-accurate\nClara Tillinghurst and boss Mr\nVogler (excellently played by Frances\nSternhagan and John Houseman).\nJamie finds himself unsettled by his\nmother's death from cancer (Diane\nWiest) and the desertion of his\nbeautiful wife Amanda (Phoebe\nCates), neither of which he can\naccept.\nThis combination increases Jamie's dependence on drink and cocaine, and\nthus begins the worst week of his life.\nThis starts with being fired for\nscrewing up a report in work. Things\nget worse from here on in. His best\nfriend yuppie executive Tad Alagash\n(Keifer Sutherland), tries to help by\nleading Jamie around the drink and\ndrug soaked nightlife of yuppie New\nYork.\nThings come to a head when\nAmanda comes to town and the\nanniversary of his mother's death\ncomes near. However there is light\nat the end of the tunnel, in the form\nof Megan (Swoozie Kurtz) and Tad's cousin Vicky (Tracy Pollen), who\ngive him the understanding he needs.\nThe film is very compelling and has\na good plot. The whole cast act very\nwell and help show James Bridges to\nbe a class director. Also impressive\nare the scenes and locations including\ndiscos and fashion shows and lots of\ngood music including New Order,\nPrince, MARRS and Konk make the\nfilm very entertaining.\nThe film has a bit of everything\n(except a car chase) from emotion to\nput a lump in your throat, to funny\nscenes to make you laugh.\nAfter, undoubtedly Fox's best\nperformance to date, I am left with\nthe notion that, after a hard day at the\nbar and an even harder night at the\nclub Michael J Fox might have grown\neven the tinniest bit of stubble! But\nno!! (Who am I to talk?)\nNevertheless those of you who\nthought he was just an annoying\nprecocious turkey might not change\nyour mind, but you will see some\ntalent.\nPaul Groves.\nFELIX Friday 10th June 1988 9\n\n"

That incident\nhas gone down in the travellers'\nfolklore as the \"Battle of the\nBeanfield\"; it has gone into the\nhistory books as the largest mass\narrest of civilians in the UK since the\n1700s, and as a milestone in public\norder policing.\nEver since, the campaign to\npublicise the injustice and to reestablish a Soltice gathering at\nStonehenge has grown year by year.\nThe actions of the police at the\nBattle of the Beanfield were a wholly\ninappropriate response to the situation\nA small festival taking place in the run-up to Stonehenge 1987\nthat existed. The police had assumed\nthat they would be dealing with a bunch of thugs out for a fight, and had\nformulated their strategy accordingly.\nIn fact, they were dealing with several\nhundred travelling families who had\nbrought with them their possessions,\ntheir homes and their children.\nWhat happened that day shocked\nmany people. It shocked the\njournalists who were there and who\ntried to interfere when they realised\nwhat was going on. It shocked the\nEarl of Cardigan who had tagged\nalong with the travellers because they\nhad camped the night on his land. It\nshocked television viewers when film\nof what had happened was broadcast\non national television news that\nevening.\nCondemnation of the police action\nfollowed: from the National Council\nfor Civil Liberties (NCCL), from the\nPolice Complaints Authority (PCA)\nand from many other organisations\nand individuals. In March last year,\nthe PCA report on the Beanfield said\nthat \"excessive force\" was used and\nthat prisoners at Amesbury Police\nStation were not treated correctly.\nCharges against those arrested on\nJune 1st1985 were subsequently\ndropped.\nThe latest development is many of\nthe people arrested that day have\nissued writs against Wiltshire's Chief\nConstable Donald Smith claiming\nwrongful arrest, imprisonment,\nassault and damage to property.\nDespite the police action on June\n1st1985, festival-goers continue to\nrisk arrest, imprisonment and damage\nto their property for the sake of a Solstice gathering at Stonehenge.\nWhy? This is not an easy question to\nanswer. The Stonehenge Free Festival\nmeant different things to different\npeople. Here is one person's view:\n' 'People used to come from all over\nthe country to be together; we didn't all know each other but we were all\nbehaving as though we'd known each\nother for a long time.\nThere was an immediacy about the\nfestival, an immediacy of\ncommunication that you get nowhere\nelse\u2014not in towns, not in cities.\nThe last few Stonehenge festivals\nwere vast and you'd find things going\non in every corner of the site\u2014music,\ndance, clowns,fire-eaters,jugglers.\nYou'd get maybe seven or eight small\nstages as well as the main stage.\nAnd then there was 'Tibet', the\nTibetian Ukrainian Mountain Troupe\n(nothing to do with Tibet or the\nUkraine!) who were a sort of\ntravelling circus. They used to set\nthemselves up somewhere and do all\nsorts of wonderful things. \"\nWally Hope\n6 Friday 10th June 1988 FELIX\n\n"

A surprising amount of\nbackground consultation goes into\neach article. This week I would like\nto acknowledge the help received\nfrom Alison Metcalfe and Valeria\nArrighi. I was unable to get you any\nhot food ie tips on eating in Rome and\nFlorence.\nIf there is not enough food for\nthought this week you are in for a gastronomic climax when I make a mystical journey from the heights of\nMughalai cuisine through to the\narousing dishes of vegetarian India.\nMama Italia\nVerona\nRegional culinary specialities are\nworth trying in preference to anything\nelse that might be available in the\nregion being visited. The hardened\ngastronomic traveller values any\nknowledge about such specialities at\na premium. Two culinary\nmasterpieces from Verona which\nmust be tried at all costs are:\nPolenta\u2014made from maize flower. A port on of pole nt a is eaten with either\nrabbit or hare or bac cala( dried salted\ncod) or s oppress a( a special Italian\nsalami) bathed in a flavour some tomato sauce.\nLesso\u2014served together with 'Peara'.\nLesso is made by boiling chicken or\nbeef or cote chino( an Italian sausage)\nor a mixture of these and is served\ntogether with the pear a, a sauce made\nfrom graded bread and marrow\ncooked in broth.\nValeria recommends strongly that\nyou drink a red wine with these\nregional favourites.\nRome\nFoodie Rome was one of the palatable\nhighlights of my visit to Italy last\nyear. The food tips I received turned\nout to be gems. I made a brief\ndeparture from the world of tr at tori as. There was the novelty of going to a restaurant serving a multi-course\nsurprise menu, still more refreshing\nwas a visit to the 'Cul-de-Sac' an\nunusual establishment specialising in\ncold meals. The main room doubled\nup as a wine cellar with wine bottles\nlining the walls from floor to ceiling.\nThe atmosphere was more on having\na good chat with friends over several\nbottles of wine, the food being quite\nsecondary, I cannot remember the\narea of Rome where these gems are\nlocated.\nI will whole-hearted ly recommend\nthe ice-cream parlour immediately\nopposite the Parliament Building.\nOnce you set foot in it you will sense\nthat you will be treated to a wide\nchoice of home-made icecream.\nA day out of Rome\nThose of you who have a day to spare\nshould take a train from Roma\nTermini to Bracciano, a town located\non an inland lake. Quite apart from\nthe scenery the food is claimed to be\nvery good, and the wine flowing in\nabundance. This is supposed to be a favourite haunt of soldiers serving in\nthe Army Barracks near by.\nUncle Sam\nI remember going for a meal in the\nresort island of Block Island, Rhode\nIsland. A scallop starter, a pan\nblackened halibut main course, a cheesecake dessert washed down with\na sea-breeze (a cocktail) cost an earth\nshattering \u00a345. That was three years\nago when the dollar was not so weak.\nThis experience aside, America is not\nan expensive place to eat and there is\nplenty of opportunity for trying the\nunusual.\nPhiladelphia\nPat Steaks (near Passayunk Av) is\nopen 24 hours a day. It is well known\nin the city for its 'Hoagies'. A hoagie\nis a type of sandwich that is an\ninstitution in this city.\nThe Frog/Commissary (1710 Sansom\nSt) has been recommended. The Frog\nhas an informal atmosphere. A large\nAmerican salad, a pumpkin cheese\ncake and a beer will cost about \u00a310.\nA meal in the Commisary will come\nto about \u00a320 a head.\nBookbinders!! Restaurant should be\ntried for good seafood.\nWashington DC\nThe whole of the Baltimore area is\nfamous for its soft shell crabs. Keep\na look out for the availability of this\ndelicacy which has a very short\nseason.\nMaine/Cape Cod\nThe lobsters found here are world\nfamous. You will normally have a choice whether to try boiled or stuffed\nbaked lobster. I have not met anyone\nwho prefers the latter.\nI had never eaten a lobster until I went to the States. The flesh of a freshly boiled lobster must figure in\nmy top ten gastronomic experiences.\nI remember picking up the live\nlobsters and taking them back home.\nThe claws have rubber bands\nclamping the claws shut.\nUnfortunately, rubber bands have to\nbe removed otherwise they give an\nunpleasant odour when boiled. The\ntrick is to remove the rubber band\nfrom the larger claw first because this\nclaw is more clumsy than its nippy\nsmaller brother. Try not to lose a finger if you end up having to grapple\nwith live lobsters like I did.\nCalifornia\nThe 'Hog's Breath Inn' in Carmel was\nrecommended specially. There might\nalso be the odd chance of running into\nClint Eastwood who owns the inn.\nBoston\nThe Oyster House cannot be missed\nby anyone who enjoys eating oysters.\nSilver Springs (Maryland)\nMrs K's Tollhouse in Silver Springs\nis a must for anyone passing through\nthis town.\nSpecial Points\nThe casinos in Las Vegas serve cheap\nmeals as a way of attracting more\npeople into the casinos so do not miss\nout under the impression that things\nwill be expensive. The casinos in\nAtlantic City do not run on the same\nprinciple but the Golden Nugget\ncasino serves cheap 'all you can eat'\ndinners.\nIt is mean not to give the waiter at\nleast a15% tip on the cost of a meal.\nThe taxman always assumes that\nwaiting personnel are tipped at that\nlevel when trying to assess taxable\nincome.\nBye for now, Yishu.\nFELIX Friday 10th June 1988 5\n\n"

    "content": "Catching up\nwith nature\nBacteria are just about the simplest\nthings there are, but the simplest bug\ncan do thousands of things that\nhumble the combined might of the\nworld's chemical industry. This\nmakes chemists very very jealous. It\nalso makes them put a lot of effort into\ncatching up.\nThe things that make chemists\njealous are the selectivity and speed\nof enzymes (nature's chemical\nfactories). Take nitrogen fixation:\nbugs can turn molecules of Nitrogen\n(N,,a notoriously inert molecule)\ninto ammonia (NH,, a reactive\nmolecule easily converted into\nfertilizer for the plants they live on)\nat room temperature and pressure.\nWhgn chemists want to make\nammonia (and they do, as more\nmolecules of ammonia are made than\nany other chemical) they have to heat\nnitrogen and hydrogen to 700 d egress at hundreds of atmospheres pressure\nover a metallic catalyst. Chemists can\ntherefore get very annoyed watching\na lawn grow.\nHowever, we have started to\nunderstand how nature does this\nclever trick. Chemists at the\nAgriculture and Food Research\nCouncil's Institute for Nitrogen\nFixation at Sussex University, have\nbeen exploring the structure of the\nnitrogen as e enzyme (where nitrogen\nfixation actually happens) and they\nknow quite a lot about it. The active\ncentre, buried deep in a large protein,\ncontains an atom of molybdenum (a fairly rare second row transition\nmetal, and the least abundant element\nknown to be important for any natural\nprocess: fans of The Hitchhiker's Guide may want to know that its\natomic number is 42; this may or may\nnot be significant).\nSome of the other chemists at\nSussex have been trying to second-guess nature by building simple\nmolybdenum compounds and looking\nat their reactions with atmospheric\nnitrogen. They have been able to do\nsome temptingly interesting chemical\nreactions, but have not yet produced\na useful room-temperature source of\nammonia.\nAs well as doing simple chemistry\nunder mild conditions, enzymes are\ngood at doing very complicated\nchemistry extremely selectively. All\nliving things are, ultimately, built up\nfrom the building bricks present in air\n(oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide)\nand water plus a few other elements\nUNDER MICRO\nby Steve Black\nin smaller quantities. The complexity\nof living things is a reflection of the\ncomplexity of the chemistry done by\ntheir enzymes.\nConsider how much chemical\njigger y poker y must be required by\nthe enzymes of the plant Caffea\nArabica to assemble bits taken from\nair and water into that molecule\nwithout which student life as we know\nit would be impossible, caffeine.\nEnzymes presumably work because\nthey are very good at recognising\nother molecules. An enzyme must\npick specific molecules from complex\nmixtures and put them together in a well-orchestrated way. To do this it\nhas to hold molecules tightly together\nand encourage them to react. We are\njust starting to uncover just how\nenzymes go about such business.\nNot all our discoveries in molecular\nThese diagrams show the molecular structure of the molecules in a chemical\nshorthand. Carbons and hydrogens are not shown explicitly so as not to clutter\nup the skeletal picture. So, each vertex in the diagram is a carbon with enough\nattached hydrogens to make its total number of bonds equal four. Me stands\nfor \u2014CH,\ncaffeine\ndi qu at par aqua td ib enzo(24) crown (8): molecules like this can tell the difference between\ndi qu at and para qu at. a sort of sandwich with bits from the\nother molecule as the filling.\nDr Williams (IC Chemistry) and his\ncolle ages realised that they might be\nable to exploit this effect to make\nsandwiches with nasty molecules such\nas di qu at and para qu at( see diagram).\nSo they made a range of different\ncrown-ether s until they found ones\nthat would form the right sort of\nsandwich. Their compounds can\ndistinguish between di qu at and\npara qu at even though they are very\nsimilar chemically. Unfortunately\nthey have not yet found a compound\nthat can cure para qu at poisoning, but\ntheir compounds can be exploited as\nvery sensitive detectors of para qu at. Studies like this are starting to help\nchemists understand how nature's factories go about telling the\ndifference between similar molecules.\nMeanwhile, other chemists are\ntrying to build very simple artificial\nenzymes. These try to incorporate just a single chemical feature found in\nsome natural system in an attempt to\nmodel one part of the enzyme at a time. For example, many enzymes\nwork by pulling a simple organic\nmolecule into proximity to a metal\natom which can cause useful\ntransformations in the bound\nmolecule (bits can be added to it or\ntaken from it).\nChemists in the Netherlands have\nrecently started work on some very\ncrude mimics of this sort of process.\nThey have built relatively simple\nmolecules with two components: one\nend of the molecule holds a metal\natom, and the other end can attract\nsome simple organic building blocks\nand bring them close to the metal\nWhen I finish my thesis I will be\ngoing to Holland to see what happens\nnext. We hope to gain some insight\ninto the way enzymes use metals to\nencourage their reactions. We might\neven be able to design some useful\nnew catalysts.\nChemists all over the world are\nputting a lot of effort into uncovering\nnature's tricks. We may not be\nmoving very quickly, but we are\ncatching up.\nCaffeine is C gH|0 O2N4 organised as\nshown in the picture. If the plant had\nleft out just one \u2014CH, then the\nmolecule would have been\ntheobromine (the much milder\nstimulant in chocolate) and student\nlife would be impossible. And\ncaffeine is just a throwaway molecule\napparently used by the plants as an\ninsecticide. The molecules we are\nbuilt from are much more complex\nthen that (and enzymes themselves\nwork well because they are extremely\ncomplex molecules).\nrecognition have been deliberate. For\nexample, workers at ICI, Imperial\nCollege and Sheffield University were\nlooking for ways to encapsulate\nc isp latin(a useful anti-cancer drug\nwith nasty side effects) when they\nnoticed an unusual interaction\nbetween bits cf one of their platinum-containing molecules and bits of their\ncomplex ing agent, a crown ether (see\ndiagram). Basically the flat aromatic\nrings (the hexagonal bits in the\npicture) can fold up (the rest of the\nmolecule is very flexible) to produce\nP.S.

The latest\nincrease is equivalent to a rise of 5% plus an additional \u00a32.50 across\nthe board on all College accommodation. In an attempt to reduce a deficit of around \u00a3100,000 from the College Residence Account, College\nwill also be charging students for one extra week in accommodation\nover the Christmas vacation.\nCollege Assistant Finance Officer\nMalcolm Aldridge explained to\nFELIX yesterday that next year's rents were increased by the smallest\namount possible and that the College\nFinance Sub-committee would have\nliked to have made the rises bigger.\nThe only thing which kept the\nincrease at 5% plus \u00a3 2 . 5 0 was that it\nhad been agreed to with last year's ICU President Christine Taig and they\ndidn't want to breach faith with the\nstudents' union.

Of the suggestions\nput forward, it was decided that\nstudents should have to pay one\nweek's rent over the Christmas period\nrather than letting out rooms for\nconferences during that time.\nMr Aldridge said that charging\nstudents over the Christmas vacation\nwould correspond with the normal\npractice in the private sector.\nAlthough this means around an extra\n\u00a335 per year per student, the extra\nincome generated will only be in the\nregion of \u00a320,000.\nA further saving that the Student\nResidence Committee has agreed to\nis the charge of a greater rent to\nstudents who live in College\naccommodation over the long\nvacations for reasons other than\nacademic ones.

    "content": "p z CZ I IV Rock 'n' Roll 'n' Retail\nA profile of Union Manager David Peacock by Judith Hackney\nI first met David Peacock in January on a late Thursday afternoon. I was\neager to interview the President about the lead news story, but he had\nbeen out all day showing some guy around the College that he was trying\nto head-hunt from the University of London Union. I wasn't in the best\nof moods when the President asked me to show Mr Peacock around the\nPrint Unit.\nDavid was eventually persuaded away\nfrom UL U, lured to Imperial by the\namazing 'potential' of IC Union, and\njoined the ICU staff at the beginning\nof this term. I finally managed to pin\nhim down for an interview and photo\nsession this week when I discovered\nthat you shouldn't judge people by\nyour first impressions!\nDavid is a very difficult person to\nphotograph. Even in the informal\nsetting of Beit Quadrangle, he still\nfound it hard to relax in front of the\ncamera. He was also cagey when I tried to find out about his life before\nULU.\nHe has a strong management and\ncatering background, having spent\nmost of his working life in\ncommercial services of one form or\nanother. He took a City & Guilds\ncookery course at Westminster\nCollege followed up with various\nprofessional courses in catering,\nrestaurant and store management\nwhich he studied up to teaching level.\n'You can tell them I read retail at\nULU,' he told me.\nDavid was very keen to talk about\nhis new job, however. 'Vat o us people in student unions all ove i he\ncountry tend to think that student\nunions shouldn't operate full scale\ncommercial services but nowadays\nthere is pressure, both fiscally and in\nterms of public relations, on unions\nto offer these basic services,' he told\nme.\nThe Union Manager is a new\nposition so I took the opportunity to\nask David what he felt his job\nentailed. He explained that he was a sort of area manager for all the Union\noutlets with existing staff structures.\nIt is his job to ensure that all outlets\nsuch as the Union Bar and Snack Bar\nare reaching a desired performance\nlevel and the services they provide are\nup to standard.\nI asked him about plans for the\nSnack Bar. He told me that there had\nbeen two consultants in to look at the\noutlet this week. He is hoping that the\nideas they come up with added to his\nown will mean a much improved\nservice next year. As far as the Union\nBar is concerned, David believes that\n'if the right things are picked upon,\nthe Bar could be a really great place'.\nHe didn't want to make too many\ninstant judgements on both the Bar\nand the Snack Bar as he felt that he\nhadn't had a chance to see both outlets\nused properly.\nAt this point I started wondering\njust what he was planning to do in the\nnext year. T want to sort out all the\nbasics before starting on my new\nideas,' he told me. 'I want to\nmaximise the potential of this place.\nThat's my reason for being here!' He\nwent on enthusiastically about the\nsuccessful outlets in American\nuniversities such as MIT, Harvard\nand UCLA. 'They've managed to find\nthe balance between service provision\nagainst trading surplus. Here we have\nto increase our market share in every\nfield wherever it is practical, because\nit not only benefits the Union\nfinancially but it's also good PR. It\nmakes the Union seem much more\nefficient.'\nI asked him how he intended to\npromote the Union's facilities. T don't believe in large scale\npromotions. The best thing to do is\nto follow the classic marketing\nprinciples.' These principles, he went\non to explain, were those of: good\nservice leads to repeated usage and\ngood publicity via recommendation.\nHe seemed slightly more at ease by\nthis stage so I managed to find out\nmore about the man behind the Union\nManager. 'Most people talk of me as\na great ideas man but I don't believe\nit. If I can claim any success\nprofessionally it is because of sheer\nhard work over the last few years.'\nHe told me that socially he is far less\n'e bull ian f than he is professionally.\nIn the office he works too hard,\nsmokes too many cigarettes and\ndrinks too much coffee. When he has\ntime to unwind he enjoys the usual\npastimes such as a social drink, a bit\nof cricket, etc.\nThe major revel la tion, though, was\nthat David spent several years as a professional drummer in a band called\nThe Bell-aires. While he was teacher\ntraining in England he would hop\naway over the weekends to the\nContinent. 'On Friday night we\nplayed Amsterdam, Brussels on\nSaturday and Paris on the Sunday.\nThen we'd take the ferry home on\nMonday morning.' The drumming\nhelped him to pay for the teacher\ntraining. 'We were big in Holland,'\nhe laughed. The group even made\nnumber 78 in the British Charts\naround 1982 with a cover version of\nAlways Something There to Remind\nMe.\nFinally I wanted to know if he had\nany ambitions left. He thought for a bit, then told me that he didn't like\nto think any further than the end of\nhis current job.\nIt's extremely difficult to sum up\nthe man after a few hours of\nconversation but he seems an\nexcellent choice for such a demanding\njob. He knows exactly what needs to\nbe done and how to go about it. I'm convinced that, despite my initial\nmisgivings about the need for a Union\nManager, David Peacock will help\nturn our Union into the kind of Union\nwhich balances providing advice and\nrepresentation with obtaining\nfinancial success and efficient\nFELIX Friday 10th June 1988 3\n\n"

    "content": "Festival Eye The festival began in 1974 when a bunch of people calling themselves\nthe Wallies turned up at Stonehenge\nand camped there for a few day over\nthe Solstice, carrying out their rituals\nand ceremonies. Their leader, Wally\nHope, was later admitted to a mental\nhospital in rather suspicious\ncircumstances and died shortly\nafterwards.\nThe next year, 1975, people came\nback with Wally Hope's ashes and\nritually scattered them in the stones.\nFrom that time the festival grew a little each year until at its peak, in\n1984, there were 30,000 people.\nThe original core consisted of\npeople with mystical or religious\nviews of what the stones and the\nSolstice ceremony were about. But\nthe festival grew to take in more and\nmore people and gradually it turned\ninto a music festival and eventually\ninto a general-purpose gathering for\npeople of all types.\nAnother important development\nwas that it became a focus for the\nNew Travellers, a new travelling\nculture unique to Britain, consisting\nof young people who had decided to\nescape the depressing environment of\nthe inner cities by going on the road.\nMany of these people now have\nchildren and a large proportion live\non the road all year. There are several\nthousand New Travellers on the road\ntoday.\nSince 1985, attempts to re-establish\nthe Stonehenge People's Free Festival\nhave led to several confrontations\nwith police.\nIn 1986, at Stoney Cross in the\nNew Forest, several hundred\ntravellers were evicted and their\nvehicles impounded, for trivial faults\nin many cases. The travellers\nmarched to Glastonbury, where\nMichael Eavis, promoter of the CND\nfestival and owner of Worthy Farm,\nallowed them to stay. Two weeks\nlater, a different group consisting of\nseveral hundred walkers from cities\nand towns was arrested on the eve of\nthe Solstice as it tried to reach\nStonehenge. Despite all this, several\nhundred people turned up at\nStonehenge for the Solstice dawn.\nLast year, most travellers took a year off and went to Glastonbury\nfestival instead. There, in two fields\non the edge of the CND festival, the\nspirit of Stonehenge was\nun mistake able. However, the year's major success was that several\nhundred walkers spent two weeks in\nWiltshire on a mobile festival that\nbecame an amazing, and spiritual,\ntravelling party.\nIt is the walkers who are likely to\nhave the easiest time this year\nbecause, unlike people with trucks,\nthey are not affected by the new anti-The Stongehenge Festival of 1984\nhippy law: Section 39 of the Public\nOrder Act. Already groups of walkers\nhave left from London, Coventry,\nBristol, Aberystwyth and\nSouthampton (for details ring 0686\n848835). This weekend there will be\na big party at Calleva Roman Town,\nnear Silchester.\nThe view of the Stonehenge\nCampaign is that it will be the power\nof the walkers that will re-establish\nthe Stonehenge festival by convincing\nthe authorities that it will be easier to\nallow the festival to happen than to\nspend millions of pounds each year\ntrying to stop it.\nAnd even if the walkers fail, they'll\nhave a lot of fun doing it. See you\nthere!\nA special Solstice magazine is\npublished every Summer. Called\nFestival Eye (and produced in your\nvery own IC Union Print Unit), it\ncosts \u00a31 (plus 25p postage) and is\navailable from: Festival Eye, c/o38 Stanmer Street, Battersea, London\nSW11 3EG.
