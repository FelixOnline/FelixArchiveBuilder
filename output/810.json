    "content": "Letters\nDear Bill\nTwo statements in your lead story\nabout Silwood Park in FELIX of 12\nAugust surprise me. The College\nhas not announced its intention to\nconvert Silwood House into a conference centre and the Biology\nDepartment has certainly not been\nmoved into new buildings to make\nroom for the centre.\nAt the time of the 198C/81 reduction in Government funding\nof universities the College had to\ndecide whether to dispose of\nSilwood Park or develop its\npotential. Governors decided on\ndevelopment which involved a long\nnegotiation with the planning\nauthorities. The first stage of the\nprogramme was the technology\ntransfer centre to meet government\nobjectives for the universities, to\nenlarge the scientific community, to\nshare the heavy overheads of huge\nparkland and to produce income.\nWith the same motivation,!\narrangements were made to provide j a site for the Commonwealth\nInstitute for Biological Control and\nthe library of the Commonwealth\nInstitute for Entymology. With this\nboost it was possible to realise the\nlong felt needs of the Biology\nDepartment to bring together its\nown two groups, one based at\nSilwood House and the other at\nAshurst Lodge. Governors agreed\nto the sale of Ashurst Lodge to\nfinance the new Garden Wood\nLaboratories which will be fully\noccupied by the end of the autumn\nterm. Sandyride House, which\nprovided accommodation for eleven\nstudents and their families, has also\nbeen sold and replaced with a block\nof six flats and a block of sixteen\nsingle rooms alongside the\nSouthwood Halls.\nWith the successful completion of\nthese developments the next need\nis the improvement of the catering\nand recreation facilities for the\nenlarged community. This larger\ncommunity provides the\nopportunity because there is no\npublic fund support for catering or\nresidence. What we are now doing\nis looking at the main Silwood\nHouse to see how it can be\nrefurbished to provide the focal\nsocial point for Silwood Park. With\nthe freeing of space formerly used\nas offices and laboratories there is\nthe possibility of transferring the\nrefectory from the wartime huts\nwhere it is poorly housed at present.\nCompany tenants are looking for a boardroom type lunch service for\nwhich there would be room. This\nkind of service provides a subsidy\nto the student side of catering which\ncannot be provided at low prices just\nduring term time without other\nbusiness to help cover overheads.\nApart form improved catering\nfacilities, common rooms and\nteaching space Silwood House will\nalso be able to provide bedrooms to\nimprove existing conference\naccommodation. There is nothing\nnew about conferences at Silwood\nPark. Space pressures have made it\nmuch more difficult to mount them\nin recent years and some, like the\nstudent Touchstone weekends,\nhave long since gone altogether. We\nnow have an opportunity to build\nup the business alongside providing\nbetter accommodation for both full-time students and short course\nstudents.\nThe College has asked Martin\nParsons to transfer to Silwood Park\nto provide professional skill in\ndeveloping the social and\nrecreational facilities. No work can\nbe undertaken without a business\nplan which shows that a loan\nfinanced project can be effect iv ly serviced. At the end of the day\neveryone there, not least the\nstudents, will enjoy far better\namenities than at present. The price\nwhich has to be paid is the good\nmanagement of resources, which\nhas enabled recent development to\ntake place. Those who hanker after\nthe good old days of rustic calm\nwith research being carried out in\nwooden huts and South Kensington\nas remote as another planet need to\nrecollect that but for the changes\nwhich have taken place there would\nbe no Silwood Park.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Smith, College Secretary.\nfil iw Rambo III\nSet against the backdrop of the\nPakistan/Afghan border, Sylvester\nStallone proves that there is still life\nafter Rocky, albeit slightly brain-damaged. Drawn out of retirement\nin a Buddhist monastery by the\ncapture of his lifelong buddy and ex-commanding officer, 'John' takes on\nthe whole Russian army aided only\nby an obnoxious Afghan rebel called\nHamid.\nThe film is based on a Rambo vs\nRussia game of hide and seek.\nRambo breaks into the crack Russian\nfortress, imparts some gratuitous\nviolence, then breaks out, only to\nbreak in again when the Russians\nare looking for him in the desert.\nWith his diminutive ally he shows\nthat Americans firing stolen\nKalashnikovs are far superior to\ntrained Russian commanders with\nthe same weapon: if this is how the\nRussians shoot, World War 3 will be\na walkover for NATO. Rambo 3 is\nexactly what you'd expect Rambo 3\nto be. See it if you want some light\nentertainment. It's a shame\nPerestroika made it even more\nincredible than it was meant to be.\nPlan of Silwood Park Refurbishment\nSILWOOD PARK REFURBISHMENT\nSCHEME 4\nGROUND FLOOR\nPage 2 FELIX September 9 1988\n\n"

The work will take a month or so, during which students\nwill be given meal vouchers for use\nin the college refectories. He went\non to say that he had discarded\nseveral other properties, which were\nnot suitable for immediate use. Mr\nSmith added that the college is also;\nplanning to purchase a further;\nproperty for \u00a3400,000 on a similar!\nfinancial basis, in time for next term.\nThe hostel on Chelsea Bridge Road\nis part of a converted nurses home\nand will house 12 students. Mr\nSmith hopes to have exchanged\ncontracts by the end of this week.\nHe said 'People are always accusing\nme of not taking risks, and now I'm taking one.'He hopes that the\nfinancial situation for the new I purchases 'should look reasonable' j after three to five years.\nNew mag\n'London Student', the magazine of\nthe University of London Union will\nbe relaunched this October.\nIts new editor, Jane Headon,\npromises a completely redesigned,\nthicker publication with wider and\nfuller News, Sport and Arts pages\nand Travel pages designed 'much\nmore with the student traveller in\nmind.'\nNew loo\nAfter a break-in at 9 Princes Gardens\nthe college has decided to rethink its\nsecurity arrangements for the\nNorthside of Princes Gardens. The\nhouse contains postgraduate flats,1\none of which had \u00a3200 worth of1 jewelery and camera equipment'\nstolen from it on Tuesday night.\nTwo other unoccupied flats were\nalso broken into. Security Officer,\nTerry Briley told FELIX that workers\nfrom Nightline had left a basement\ndoor in 9 Princes Gardens open that\nnight.\nThe college plans to install a separate toilet for the West London\nChaplaincy. At present, members of\nthe Chaplaincy use the Garden Hall\nfacilities. The new toilet will allow\nthe rest of the hall to be isolated\nfrom the basement.\nJuke-box jury\nA new juke-box has been installed\nin the Union Lounge Bar and Snack\nBar area and the Imperial College\nRadio speakers have been removed.\nThe move has been a cause for\ncomplaint from Imperial College\nRadio. Station manager, Nigel\nWhitfield, said 'It would have been\nnice if we'd known something about\nit.'\nMr Whitfield told FELIX that the\nloss of the snack bar as a broadcasting area would lead to a reduction in the number of listeners\nand a fall in their complimentary\nrecord income.\nIC Radio received 300 free records\nfrom companies last year but the\nfigure has been declining for several\nComputer thefts\ncontinue unchecked\nyears.\nChas Brereton, ICU Deputy\nPresident, told FELIX that he felt IC\nRadio should be able to broadcast in\nthe snack bar 'under the control of\nthe Snack Bar and Bar Manager'.\nICU Hon Sec lan Morris admitted\nthat the Union had 'been a bit\nstupid' and had not entered into\ntalks with IC Radio before the move.\nHe went on to suggest that the jukebox could be converted to allow IC\nRadio to broadcast when the jukebox is not in operation. He added\nthat the juke-box will be re-stocked\nwith four or five new Chart singles\nper week which could go to IC\nRadio.\nFurther computer thefts from\ndepartments around the college\nhave continued to baffle the college\nsecurity forces, despite an outside\npolice presence.\nTwo computers were stolen from\nthe Mechanical Engineering\ndepartment on Wednesday night.\nLater that evening, two people were\nchallenged in the Royal School of\nMines and fled leaving a computer\nbox from the Mechanical\nEngineering department. They are\ndescribed as a Filipino or Italian,\nmale accompanied by a thin female.\nMore computer equipment valued\nat \u00a35500 was stolen on August 31\nfrom the Mineral Resources\nEngineering department. Security\nOfficer, Terry Briley told FELIX that\na computer had been left unlocked\nafter a late evening's work. He went\non to say that 'We probably, have\ncontinued in next column\nmore than one suspect. This is a two\nman job.'\nThe college central administration\nhas put forward funds for better\nlocks and hopes departments will\nadd to this. Mr Briley told FELIX\nthat he hoped to install magnetic\nlocks on fire doors throughout the\ndepartments and added that a lock\nwas due to be installed upon the fire\ndoor to the Royal School of Mines.\nThe locks are of a type which\nreleases in the event of a fire and\ncost \u00a31000-\u00a32000.\nThe college had arranged for a small squad of police officers to\npatrol the college over a two week\nperiod. The plan met with little\nsuccess however, since the squad\nwas called away three nights out of\nfour. Mr Briley hopes to be able to\narrange further police surveillance\nin the future.\nObituary\nProf Alan Bishop 1920-1988\nDept of Civil Engineering 1946-1980\nProf Alan Bishop died suddenly at\nhis home in Whitstable on 30 June\n1988, while recovering from heart\nsurgery.\nHe graduated from Cambridge in\n1942 and joined the College in 1946\nfrom the Metropolitan Water Board,\nthe first recruit to the Soil Mechanics\nSchool started by AW Skepton.

    "content": "THE P:> CR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCollege gamble\non new hall\nThe college has purchased a new student residence in Earls Court to house\nabout 40 students next term. College Secretary, John Smith exchanged\ncontracts last Friday for the former Girl Guides Hostel, Olave House.\nMr Smith hopes that part of the loan by securing funds from other\n\u00a31.6 million cost of the purchase will\nbe met by the Sherfield Trust, with\nthe balance of around \u00a31.3 million\nto be financed by a loan. The\nSherfield Trust is legally\nindependent of the college and is\nadministered by a group of trustees,\nmostly made up of the college's governors. Mr Smith is the secretary\nof the trust.\nThe \u00a31.6 million bid was referred\nto the Charities Commission a month ago since the Girl Guides\nAssociation is a registered charity,\nand was returned last week. The\npurchase has been described as 'a gamble' by Mr Smith and Senior\nAssistant Finance Officer, Malcolm\nAldridge.\nMr Smith told FELIX that students\nliving in the new house would have\nto pay \u00a3100 per week to cover the\nloan interest and this was not\nfeasible. Rents will be set at around\n\u00a3 5 5 per week, with interest\naccumulating upon the original\nloan. Mr Smith hopes to reduce the\ntrusts. Mr Aldridge told FELIX that\nif this fails the loan capital will\ncontinue to increase at a hopefully\nlower rate than the property value\nrise. The \u00a31.6 million bid for the\nproperty was tendered when\ninterest rates were lower than at\npresent and property values in\ncentral London were rising at a higher rate.\nThe contract for the purchase of\nOlave House will be completed on\n30th September, after which the\nhostel will be ready for immediate\nuse by the student accommodation\noffice. Mr Smith stressed that the\ncost of the purchase would not be\ntransferred to students outside\nOlave House, in line with the\ncollege's agreement with former\nICU President, Christine Taig. The\nCollege agreed not to transfer the\ncost of any further purchases to the\noverall students residence account\nafter the purchase of Fisher Hall.\nThe new house is made up of two\ncontinued on back page\nGeology slams\nUGC review\nFollowing their review of Earth\nSciences, the University Grants\nCommittee have instructed\nImperial's Geology department to\n[reduce its quota of staff and\n| students. The department has been\n| told to lose 10 academic staff and 13\nnon\u2014academic staff and to reduce\nj its annual undergraduate intake\n;from 45 to 32. As part of the UGC'sj requirements, the department has\nIbeen 'reorganised' into teaching and\nresearch divisions. The UGC's decision has come under heavy fire\nIfrom academics within Geology.\nThe academics are critical of the\njUG C's alleged use of the Science\nCitation Index as a means of\nassessing the quantity of research\ncarried out at Imperial. They argue\nthat the index does not take into\naccount many of the journals which\npublish the work from applied\nGeology Departments such as\nImperial. They also point out that\nmuch of the work carried out by the\ndepartment is for industry and\nhence is not available for open\npublication.\nHead of the Geology Department,\nDr Richard Selley told FELIX that\nthe department was amongst the\ntop two or three in the country in\nevery criterion assessed by the UGC Committee. 'We were told by a member of the UGC Committee that\nwe were subjectively assessed,' he\nsaid. He is critical of the fact that the\nChairman of the regional Earth\nSciences Committee spent only two\nhours at the College before the\nassessment was made. This is in\nsharp contrast to the current UGC review of Petroleum Engineering\nduring which the whole committee\nvisited the department for two days.\n\"The reviewers were basically\npure academic Geologists and were\nreluctant to accept Imperial\nCollege's international status,' he\nsaid.\nThe UGC' s stance that the\nGeology Department carries out too\nmuch consul at at ive work has also\nFELIX spoke to Professor Mc\nConnell, regional chairman of the\nEarth Sciences Review Committee.\nProfessor McConnell told FELIX that\nthe UGC's decision was based\nprimarily on a 'bid' made by the\ndepartment outlining their plans for\nthe next ten to fifteen years. 'The\nUGC made a complete analysis of\nthe figures but they weren't specifically used,' he said.\nThe bid was made by the\ndepartment as part of a detailed\ndossier which the Geology\nDepartment submitted to the UGC at the beginning of the year. The\nUGC were unhappy with the bid\nand asked for it to be resubmitted\ntwice. The first draft of the bid called\nfor moderate increases in staff and\nstudent numbers and equipment.\nThe revised version outlined the\nplanned 'restructuring' of the\ndepartment into teaching and\nresearch sections.\nAccording to the Department, the\nUGC declined to say why they were\nunhappy with the bid. 'We didn't know what we were were bidding\nfor,' said Dr Selley.\nThe Rector Professor Eric Ash,\ntold FELIX that the cutbacks would\nbe softened by support from\nindustry. Following a press\nconference given by the Rector in\nJune, industry has sponsored two\nlectureship s and it is hoped that\nmore will be forthcoming. 'It is not\nat all certain that the numbers of\nstaff and students will be\ndecreased,' he said.\nISSUE8109 SEPT1988 "

    "content": "Feature\nEditor\\o Silwood. The College Secretary,\nJohn Smith is quite right to point out\nthe error in FELIX's coverage of the\nSilwood Park Conference Centre in\nissue 808. The College have not announced their decision to build a conference centre at Silwood. Far\nfrom it, the matter has been kept as\nquiet as possible.\nThe Students at Silwood have every\nright to be concerned about their\nfuture. They have been told little or\nnothing officially and the rumours\nand half truths which have been circulating offer little consolation. They\nare not the only one's who have\nbeen kept in the dark; the College's Trade Unions have been trying to\nfind out the facts for a long time,\nwith little success. I spent the best\npart of a week trying to weed le out\nthe truth about Silwood.\nI am not suggesting that there is\nanything sinister about the Silwood\ndevelopment, but I think that the\nCollege ought to ask itself whether\nits Colonial closed door style of\nmanagement is appropriate to a modern institution. Does the College really have anything to fear by\nbeing open ?\nHappy Birthday. Congratulations to\nClare McErlane on her 21st Birthday. Drop in to the office for a drink,\nClare. Next Issue.

Local\nconditions (weather and soil) give\nrise to a great variety of wines.\nChablis is made from the\nChardonnay grape, and is relatively\nexpensive due to the small quantity\nof it actually produced (compared to\nother wines.) Much of the available\nproduce is exported to the UK or\nUSA. A good fine white wine, this\nis recommended!\nCote de Nuits and Cote de Beaune\ntogether form the Cote d 'Or a first\nclass region producing mainly red\nwines. These, especially wines from\nCote de Nuits, are regarded as\namongst the finest in the world.\nFamous names include Chambertin\nmeat for about 4 minutes until\nsealed.

Potatoes\nand a green vegetable such as\nrunner beans or mange tout make\na pleasant accompaniment to\nGuinness Pie.\nA full red wine such as Cabernet\nSauvignon would be suitable to\ndrink with this dish.\nGlossary\nMarinate\u2014to steep meat or fish in a mixture of wine, vinegar, oil, herbs,\netc.\nSeai(meat)\u2014to brown and cook the\nsurface, leaving the meat red (rare)\ninside.\nand Richebourg. Cote de Beaune\nalso produces a small quantity of\nfirst class white wines. These are\namazing, but correspondingly\nwallet mangling.\nCote Chalonnaise produces\npowerful red wines, lighter than\nthose of Cote de Beaune. The white\nwines are firm and dry and many of\nthem are sparkling.\nMaconnais principally produces\nan agreeable white wine made from\nthe Chardonnay grape. However,\nMacon Rouge, produced from Pinot\nand Gamay grapes, is a magic wine,\nand thoroughly drinkable.\nThe most sizeable region of\nBurgundy, Beaujolais, is a truly\nprolific one. The Gamay grapes\nproduce a wine that should be\n'guzzled' within the year...sounds\ngood to me!\nSeptember 9 1988 FELIX Page 3\n\n"
