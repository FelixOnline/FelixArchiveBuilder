    "content": "2 FELLX\nBondi speaks\n\u2022\nScience and Religion\" THERE WAS not now, as\nthere had been in the day of\nHuxley himself, a direct conflict between religion and\nscience.\" So began Professor\nHerman Bondi of Kings Col-'\nleg e, when he addressed the\nHuxley Society on the subject\nof Religion and Science. Nowdays religious fundamentalists\nare a minority; generally theology tends to be more interpretive than in the past.\nThere is still, however, a Conflict arising from the different\nmethods of approach to problems.\nMuch of religion relies on\" revelation\" which is not open to speculative questioning, whereas doubt is\nthe\" meat\" of science. If experimental results conflict with the\npredictions of a theory, the theory\ncan be said to be disproved, although agreement of theoretical\nand empirical data does not necessarily prove the theory. A good ex-ample is Newton's Theory of\nGravitation which was not disproved for 2 0 0 years, in fact, until\ntechnology enabled measurements\nto be made which showed up it a j inability to account accurately for real situations.\nThus the essence of science is\nacceptance of the yard stick of exp eri mental disproof. Since such disproof must be universal y accepted\nby definition, science is sp me thing on which people of many countries\nand backgrounds can agree, where as religious ideas vary widely from one group to another. This is be cause religion is one of these personal areas of life where decisions,\nare influenced by the social and sexual attributes of the human being, rather than logical deduct-ion. Obviously science does not pretend to legislate here. It is for this reason that there can be no certainty and universal agreement\nin such decision^ as those involving\" taste\" or personal preference.\nFortunately, we are all different,\nand we can all, intelligently and sincerely hold different opinions\nwith equal validity.\nArising from this said the Professor, it seemed to him to be ba.'call y wrong that religious attitudes\nshould be imposed on people, for example by teaching one particular religion in schools. Religion should not be a State responsibility, but a personal one. History shows that\nan adopted state religion usually leads to conflict and suffering.\nRather, one should in form children of the fact that there are many different religions, and that no part icu lar one holds the universal and exclusive truth but everyone is en titled to his own preference.\nNIGEL SHI NDLER SKEMPTON\nIN ROME\nPROFESSOR A.W.

    "content": "6 FELLX\nThe Halls-Fact and Fable\nMike Wilson (Halls Rep. on Council) defends the selection\nsystem against charges of bias\nMuch criticism has been levelled recently at the Halls system in I.C. In fact, a recent editorial in this paper asked\nwhether wardens should. determine the\nmoral standards of residents, as this appeared to be the current trend. It compared Halls to boarding school dormitories,\nand it followed several letters in the correspondence columns of the same general\ntenor. One also frequently hears the allegation that the Halls are closed shops.\nHow much truth is three in this, and how\nbad are the Halls really?\nAvoidance of Two Worlds\nIn a note to the U.G.C., in1965 the Rector laid down the principles upon which the residential system at this college works: \u2014 \" We have\ntried to avoid the building up of two worlds \u2014\nthe privileged residents, and the under pri vile ged non-residents.\" This has been done by ensuring that refectory facilities were shared with non residents and that tutors and their equivalents!\nshould be restricted to departments i \u2014unlike\nOxbridge and some other universities. Also the siting of Halls in the immediate vicinity of the College is important. The old Selkirk Hall in Holland Park was abandoned because it gave\nPARIS and back for only \u00a3 5 . 1 9 . 6\n(plus supplement of \u00a31 each\nway for weekend travel)\nTOWNSEND\nnew\ninter-capital\nservice\nThe cheapest through service\nfrom city centre to city centre\nby luxury coach and\nmodern, luxurious\n'Free Enterprise' ships\nWrite for Tariff, Timetable and Booking Form Townsend Car Ferries Limited\n(Inter-Capitals Service)\nDept. ICT 9\nNuffield House, 41, Piccadilly,\nLondon.\nrise to just such problems. Obviously residents\nare privileged, but every attempt has been made to keep this to a minimum. As to Hall being a closed shop, any residents will know that this, is\nnonsense. 2 5 % of each Hall's residents have two years in Hall,25% are fresher s and about 5 0 %\nare people who are in Hall for the first time.\nObviously the selection procedure is not perfect,\nbut improvements are difficult to envisage.\nNo bias towards the Rugby Club\nFew people would prefer the wardens tilling\ntheir own Halls with those they consider to be \"desirable residents\". The Pin Method has something to be said for it, but not much, and the departmental method is the \u2022method currently used to select fresher s, and has met much criticism.\nAllegations, such as the current one that if you are not a rugby playing Guilds man you can't get into Ti zard are totally unfounded. No doubt the Rugby Club makes its presence felt, but there are no more Guilds men inTi zard than in the College as a whole, and furthermore, a higher\npercentage of Guilds apply to Halls than Mines or R.C.S. In Feat of the 'News of the World'\nWhat are the chances of getting in? At the moment there are less, than three applications\nfor every available place. A survey carried out five years ago showed that if they were offered\na place in Hall75% of the undergraduates and50% of the post-graduates at I.C. would accept.\nIn fact only 4 5 % of the undergraduates and24% of the post-grad a at es apply. There is obviously a need for sx>me sort of\ndisciplinary authority \u2014 the threats from West minster City Council to close down Southside on the grounds that is was a public nuisance bear this out. The current system could hardly bo more lenient, with the absolute minimum of regulations. The need for noise regulations is\nobvious, and not to have the\" overnight guest\"\nrule would leave the system open to many a bus ed, such as students sharing rooms designed for\none. As far as women guests, it does not take\nmuch imagination to see what the News of the\nWorld would say .once Southside got the reputation of the\" South Kensington WhoreHouse\". Although the College does not want to impose\nSet moral standards on its students it must consider its reputation. Hence the other \" basic\" regulation: \u2014 \" . . . conduct prejudicial to the good name of the College...( is) ... misbehaviour of\nwhich the Hall Committees have been instructed\nto take a serious view\". Overnight guests sometimes permitted\nSome rules are necessary and when rules are\ndeliberately broken, it is, normal to punish the offenders. Punishments in I.C. Halls are so in frequent that their publicity is due more to their\nscarcity than to their severity. It is not necessary to break the rules. If, for instance, under exceptional circumstance^ a resident wishes to\nintroduce an overnight guest, this is not forbid dem It is the UNAUTHORISED introduction\nof su cfl' guests that brings down the wrath of the\nwardens. If the circumstances merited it, per mission to introduce an overnight guest could be obtained from the warden or sub warden concerned. Powerful Hall Committees\nPeople often underestimate the power and effectiveness of Hall Committees( and of the\nUnion) in the running of the Hall s.Hall Com mutes are students elected by their fellow residents and they have a very big say in how a Hall is run. Although a Warden is ultimately responsible for the running of his Hall, and has the power\" to take summary action\", this rarely, if\never, happens. The regulations are extraordinarily flexible, and the Hall Committees help to\nkeep them so. A move at the beginning of this\nsef J Gion to specify the \"reasonable hour by which guests will normally be expected to leave\", never\ngot off the ground. Proposals for systems of\npunishments such as fines, were squashed by the\nHall Committees, the famed Proctors never appeared because of student opinion, and when the words \" immoral conduct\" appeared in the\nproofs for the changes in the regulations made in 1964 they were promptly deleted following objections from Hall Committees.

S. instead of through\nLondon University, they were able\nto propose motions in their own\nname, and full advantage was taken of this.\nTwo motions were proposed, the t first largely endorsing the Buchanan Report on Traffic in Towns was proposed by Edward Fortune and carried overwhelmingly and the second, proposed by Mike Mans field, dealing with the status of\nP.G.' s. suggested that they be paid b v salary rather than by grant was also passed overwhelmingly.

U.L. S. would have a major part to play in this.\ndriven to Earls Court for\nCrypton Tuning. This led us to\nreadjust the timing. The evening\nwas spent teaching the two new\ndrivers the intricacies of a crash\ngearbox in a tour of the West\nt nd. This was related on\nSaturday, when we ran out of\npetrol in Regent Street to the\nem baras s ment of the crew and\namusement of the crowds.\nOn Sunday mo ming we set off at7.00 a.m. for Clapham Transport Museum. Judicious persuasion of\nMarahalls got us to near the head of the queue, and we left the start\njust after 9.00. The journey, in brilliant sunshine was gloriously un eventful, J ez behaving excellently in her first long run for two years. Our entry into Brighton was a little\nhazardous, as the clutch control\ncame adrift and we had to drive through the town to the finish with out it. This was rapidly repaired once\nwe had parked, and we spent the afternoon sunbathing. A t5o 'clock\nwe started home\u2014-but found that\nthe foot brake wasn't operating\u2014so\nwe tightened the coupling. How ever, by some miles out of Brighton, the coupling had cooled and contracted sufficiently to bind on the\nbrake. We stopped, boiling violent-ly. An hour later, cooled andre leaved, we set off. About15 miles\nfrom London we stopped at a Hosteler y for sustenance. However, stopping the engine stops the water\npump. So she boiled. She boiled, in fact, so violently that she shot\nthe best part of eight gallons out of the top of the radiator and the overflow. On cooling and refilling\nJez and the driver we started (to\nthe surprise of one old gentleman\nwho said we should have fitted the new bearings with a file and cold chisel) by merely switching on the\nignition. The run back to South Kensington was covered in an hour and a half, J ez was garaged, and the extremely tired, but overjoyed\ndrivers and crew celebrated by going home to bed. Clementine also made Brighton s uc deS fully \u2014 although she too had trouble with over-heating. The only\nmajor disaster was the breakdown of one of the attendant cars, driven by Goldie Smith.\" YOU BRIGHT YOUNG MEN should change your minds and become Engineers.' This was the main theme of Professor Blackett \u2014\nPresident of the Royal Society \u2014 in his address (o the Royal College of\nScience at that College's annual Dinner on May2. Professor Blackett \u2014 proposing the toast to 'the Union' pointed out that while Britain is ' frightfully good at pure science' but drew at\ntent ion to our failure to 'completely\nmake the grade at the application of science through technology'. This he suggested was due to the British practice of ' putting too high a proportion of our manpower into\npure science' and would only be overcome if trained scientists became Engineers. A former Dean of\nR.C.S., Professor Blackett was at\npains to explain that he was not suggesting that members of R.CS. should join Guilds Union, only that\nthey should turn their attentions to\nthe technologies.\nProfessor Blackett\nKENNETH TY NAN in the celluloid jungle( Stupendous!

He said that London was a fascinating city and\nEngland a country of boundless possibility, but he implored them to go back to Pakistan because that was where they were needed the most.\nThe dinner, which was prepared by an outside caterer, was one\nof the highest quality and was attended by about 70 people including many members of staff. India Societ3>-.\nThe India Society held their annual dinner in the Union main\ndining hall on Wednesday night. The dinner got off to a late start because the principal guest, His Excellency, the Indian High Commissioner, arrived about an hour late. He was stuck in a traffic jam in Bond Street, and had to make a detour via the North Circular. After an excellent meal cooked by a chef from the Indian High Commission, His Excellency gave a short speech in which he stressed the need for Indian students to return to India upon completion of\ntheir degrees. He said that the present famine in India was very serious and that its solution lay in the application of modern\nscientific and technological techniques. Ths was followed by what seemed to be one of the Rector's mos it amusing speeches, in which he demonstrated his encyclopaedic know-ledge' of India and In ian students.

    "content": "4 FELIX\nComment by the\neditor\nAT TIPS perhaps the most startlingly quiet,\nperiod of the academic year we area mid the throes of intense political activity as contenders seek support for their election to various\nposts in the Union. Without ramming that much labour ed word\" apathy\" down the throats of one and all. I shall merely record that I deplore the general lack of competition for office. E spec i ally in view of Premier Wilson's recent wise\nwords, one would have hoped to., see greater\nenthusiasm amongst IC students for at least\nsome minor experience in management. After all, scientifically-trained managers are in ever-increasing demand from industry and personal experience in the students' union is every\nbit as essential as being taught management\ntechniques;.\nBlueprint for President\nIt w oud be asad reflection on this, one of the\nmost highly respected educational institutions\nin the world, if IC tended to attract only the type of student who is prepared neither to\nlead nor to take any initiative, and lacks any personality.. Fortunately this is not sp. but among those who do show sufficient interest\nto take office are represented only a minority of the most eligible and capable students. The exclusion of the rest leads to their detriment\nand the Union's loss.\nNow it is almost too late for the individual to\nmake any significant contribution to next\nyear's Union policymakers other than the record his or her vote. The most important\nchoice has yet to be made fr it will be incumbent upon the Pres'i lent to create the image of ICU. Beyond nominations, this\nmatter is entirely out ot the hands of the\nordinary member of the Union except through his representatives at the joint Council meeting on 6 June.\nMost of those on next year's Council yet await\nelection. Your vote for a constituent college\nPresident, a clubs, committee chairman or\nUnion floor rep. could decide between a blind planner and an inactive listener for the Union's top post. The ideal President should combine the qualities of sound administrator, superb\nchairman, excellent public speaker and active\nsocialite, and, above all, he should understand\nhis Union. However, this zenith is perhaps\nbeyond the pale for all time, and will certain ly not be achieved on this occasion. But he who wins must reflect which are considered\nthe most important of these characteristics.\nF HIX\nImperial College Union\nPrince Consort Road\nLondon, S.W.7 Telephones : KEN2963 Internal 2881/2799\nEDITOR Assistant Editor Business Manager Production Manager News Editors\nFeatures Editor Sports Editor Photographic Editor Treasurer\nSales Manager Asst.

Cavanagh has been more concerned\nwith relations within Chemistry lie ing largely responsible for the formation of the academic subcommittee in that department.

W. opposes\nloans suggestion\nWorth E500ma year to industry IN THE latest edition of\ntheir i our nal, the Association of\nScientific Workers take a firm\nstand against the suggestion of\nthe Department of Education\nand Science that students grants\nshould be replaced by loans.\nIn an interview. Mr. Harry Fair brother, the secretary of the I.C. branch association, said that the\nGovernment tended to regard hig her education as a, social service\nwhich placed a financial burden on the community, rather than regard-ing it as an investment for future\nbenefits. The A.S c.W. had. how ever, morn ted a survey which showed ti at the benefit to the\ncountry fr c:n graduates who entered research departments alone was\nof the order of \u00a3 5 0 0 million per year \u2014 far in excess of what the\ngovernment consider university\neducation will be worth in the next\nfew years.\nThe Association objects to loans\nprimarily l x 'cause students would be\ndeterred i rom entering universities\nby the prospect of having to repay\nthe money they obtain. Students\nentering universities are making a financial sacrifice on what they\ncould e amin scientific employment on leaving school. Many people\nfaced with the prospect of repaying university grants would pro haly prefer to go straight into industry from school. In fact the Def i art ment of Education and Science\nlas been re buit ed by so many concerned parties on similar grounds,\nthat all present plans have been\nshelved, although the department is\nstill committed to work within the framework of the National Plan. The article in the journal also\npoints out that undergraduates use\ntheir grants to pay their way during term-time and during vacations\nare forced into taking any job\nwhich will bring enough money to\nmake ends meet. The Association\nsuggests that grants should be adjusted to make undergraduates in comes comparable with those of\nothers of the same age group in full time employment. One way of\nraising more money, the Association\nsays, would be in the form of a tax\non productive enterprises. The article also suggests a review of\ngrants to postgraduates, married and other students.\nROGER COOP EP N.Ed.: The Secretary of State for\nEducation and Science in rep lv to\na letter from an MP( JE Mac Coll) sent following the Loans Lobby states that it is NOT Government policy to introduce loans, nor are\nthere any proposals for them.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nNorthern Outpost\nA Visit to Carlisle\nCarlisle has followed the normal course\nof development of the Redbrick Universities. Starting as a specialist foundation of\nthe Methodist Church at the turn of the\ncentury, it later accepted students to read\nfor the University of London external degrees and received its charter from the Privy\nCouncil during the period of rapid university expansion just after the war. Smaller\nthan the institutions we have reviewed in\nprevious articles of this irregular series,\nCarlisle has just under 2,000 students\u2014the\nvast majority of them in Halls of residence. Contraception and Segregation\nAt \u00a35.14.0d.a week .the halls provide excellent value with comfortably furnished rooms and well cooked meals. The one old hall (for Men) provides few bathrooms or showers and most of\nthe rooms do not have wash basins as it isi a conversion of the old country house in which the college was founded. To a visitor from I.C..H all discipline seems unbelievably strict, all visitors\nmust leave by 10.30 p.m. and no resident is allowed to take visitors of the opposite sex up to\nhis room. As Carlisle was one of the first universities to introduce contraceptive advice into its\nhealth room this shows a surprising lack of\ntechnical knowledge on the part of the Authorities. In the manner of the old country house, the\ncollege buildings are isolated from one another\nin the extensive grounds, some of which form\nthe splendid playing fields. The college is self-contained, and students seldom need to leave the\ncampus. This is partly due to the fine shopping facilities in the Union. However this development of a thriving university life is probably due to the lack of facilities for recreation in the town of Carlisle. It has an essentially rural at mo sphere, incomplete contrast to I.C. The relatively modem Union presents a glassy aspect and is said to be ill-ventilated: it has, fine all round facilities, including a superbly equipped concert-hall and cinema with comfortable tip up seats.\nMobile Mascot\nThe University achieved a measure of fame\nin reaching the quarter-final of the Observer Mac o \u2022debating competition. Its Indian president. Yava\nS a hid, told me that the young, forward looking vice-chancellor. Sir Lewis Anderson was largely responsible for the speedy completion of the\nnew Union facilities and the flexibility of the\nundergraduate courses\u2014it being a common oc-cu rence for students to change subjects at the\nend of the first year.\nOn the lighter side, the college boasts an impressive e ol' re tion of mascots including a1900 De Dion Bouton tricycle and a stuffed griffon\n( WH club take not el. It indulges in occasional\nraids on the University of Lancaster and once\nroamed as far as Man Tech. The most well known department of the\nUniversity is the Faculty of Social Sciences,\nwhich is renowned for its researches in industrial psychology under Professor Buckliouse, an\nAmerican from Harvard Business School. In\ndirect contrast with I.C.. Carlisle- is principally a University for the Arts student, scientists\nnumbering only some 400.\nC. G.H. Tangent Reviewed\nIt seems that the tradition of choosing\nthe Notting Hill Gate Housing Trust as the\nl.C. Carnival Charity has started a tradition in Carnival magazines. Tangent, this\nyear's magazine, is exactly the same as last\nyear's Etc. in construction and layout.\nUnfortunately the amount of copy in\nTangent is very little, making it a bad buy\nfor Z/6( or even more). It can be argued\nthat since it is being sold for charity it does\nnot matter what the magazine is like. However, a charity magazine should be able to\nsell for its own sake, and this, I feel,\nTangent will not do.\nThe idea of the magazine containing articles\nwritten by prominent personalities is basically a good one, but in Tangent it is taken too far.\nOnly the E dio tria! and the Carnival Organiser's column can be said to be original, and even that\nis dubious( compare with Etc.). Even the quality of the borrowed material is not too high, with the notable exception of Michael Fray n's piece ( which I happened to have already read\nin the Observer about two months ago).\nThe small size of Tangent can easily be acc o un ted for by the lack of advertising contained in it. But there is no lack of people wishing to\nadvertise so there must have been a lack of\npeople wishing to go out and get it. Surely there must be some original talent in\na College of this size-\u2014oven if we are all scientists. The great trouble is waiting for\nvolunteers. One is much more prepared to help if asked personally. The Carnival Organisers\nshould know of people with ability and ask\nthem for contributions. The magazine as it\nstands, could have come from anywhere, and therefore needs something apart from the cover\nto give it a personality of its own. Peter Combe s Overseas\nChallenge\nWhy not study for a post-graduate\nqualification in education, at a University in\nAfrica?\nFollow this with a short-term teaching\ncontract, and you will help a developing\ncountry\u2014and broaden your own experience.\nIf you are interested in an Overseas\nPostgraduate Diploma in Education course\u2014\nrecognised in Britain\u2014followed by a spell in\nKenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Zambia\u2014\nwrite for information NOW to :\u2014\nThe Appointments Officer,\nMINISTRY OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT, Eland House.\nStag Place, Victoria.\nLondon, S.
