    "content": "Pasta la vista, baby\nElizabeth Crow on jazzing up Mondays and THE de-facto student dish\nhe idea for pasta Mondays\ncame about as a way for\nmy boyfriend to try to get\nme and my \ufb02atmate to eat\nmore carbs. Before this we\ntended to succumb to \u2018no-carb-days\u2019\n(betterknownas\u2018no-fun-days\u2019)andother such health kick fads! We appreciated\nbeing cooked for and the opportunity\nto eat together, but his pasta Mondays\ngenerally consisted of overwhelming\n\u2018rower-sized\u2019 portions of pasta often accompanied with some sort of pesto, occasionally some chicken, and perhaps a\nconcession of tomatoes for us girls.\nSince he has moved out of London, we\nhave continued the tradition of substantial portions to ful\ufb01l the main aim of eating more carbs. We still enjoy having at\nleast one evening in the week where we\nmake the e\ufb00ort to sit down and eat to-gether, but we\u2019ve taken on the challenge\nof creating cheap, quick and exciting\nT\nFOOD\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n22\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\npasta dishes that we really like eating. I\nhave particularly enjoyed being inspired\nby pasta recipes in my favourite recipe\nbooks that I would have previously\nskimmed over if I was cooking for other\npeople; it came as a surprise to me that\npasta could be a impressive dish to serve\nfor special meals too!\nhe Pasta Mondays rules are as fol-lows: the meal must be cheap, simple\nand easy to cook (preferably all made in\nless that half an hour \u2013 the exception to\nthis rule is lasagne, which is worth taking your time over), involve at least one\ntype of vegetable (one of your 5 a day!)\nand exciting (no sauce from a jar!). We\noften try to devise healthy twists of traditional pasta dishes or take inspiration\nfrom pasta recipes found in our favourite cookbooks. I have included some\nof our creations to help inspire your\nown Pasta Mondays (or Tuesdays, or\nWednesdays...).\nThis is a healthy and quick twist on the traditional macaroni\ncheese. Penne or fusilli will work equally well. \u2013 Serves 2\n250g pasta\nOne small head of broccoli and one small head of cauliflower\n(or a pack of broccoli and cauliflower florets)\nOne pack of soft cheese (300g)\n2tsp grainy mustard\nGood handful of strong cheddar to sprinkle on top.\nSalt and pepper\nCauliflower and Broccoli Cheese\nChop the broccoli and cauliflower heads into small pieces Put pasta on the boil and cook as per packet instructions. While\nthe pasta is cooking, put the vegetables in a sieve or steamer pan and steam over the pasta until both the pasta and vegetables are cooked. They should be done at roughly the same time.\nPreheat the grill to medium. Drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water and add the vegetables, soft cheese,\nmustard and seasoning to the pasta pan. Stir until everything is well combined; if it looks a bit sticky, add a little of the\ncooking water.\nPour the contents of the pan into a flat oven proof dish, then scatter over the cheddar and a grind of pepper. Put the dish\nunder the grill until the cheddar is crispy and golden. Serve at the table in the dish and enjoy!\nI never believed this was worth making until I did one Pasta Monday \u2013 not only is it easy, but it tastes SO much better than\npesto from a jar (and I like pesto from a jar!) There are many variations on this classic recipe \u2013 I have included two below\nthat we have tried and loved.\nWe use a mini chopper/food processor to make ours, but you can still easily make a more \u2018deconstructed\u2019 pesto by finely\nchopping the ingredients by hand.\nBasil Pesto\n50g pine nuts\n50g parmesan cheese\n1 bunch fresh basil leaves\n1-2 cloves garlic, peeled\nOlive oil\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\nA squeeze of lemon juice\nToast the pine nuts (by dry frying in a pan or under a medium grill) until golden. Put most of the pine nuts, the parmesan,\nbasil,garlicandaglugofoliveoilintheminichopperandblend,graduallyaddingmoreoiluntilyouhaveapesto-likeconsist-ency. Add a dash of lemon juice, season to taste and sprinkle over the remaining pine nuts. Use in pasta dishes as desired.\nIfyoudon\u2019thaveafoodprocessor/minichopper:Finelygratetheparmesan,thenfinelychopthebasilandgarlicwithaknife.\nCombine with the pine nuts and olive oil until the pesto-like consistency is achieved. Season as above.\nAlternative: Spinach, Walnut and Goat\u2019s Cheese Pesto\nThis is made in exactly the same way as above but substituting 60-70g spinach for the basil, 50g strong, hard goat\u2019s cheese\nfor the parmesan and 50g walnuts for the pine nuts (if making by hand, chop the walnuts into smaller pieces.) Omit the\nlemon juice at the end.\nREAL Pesto\nThe Best-o Pesto that ever was(?) in action\nSo, what\u2019s the big deal?\nCarol Ann Cheah\nFood Editor\nIt\u2019s easy to see why pasta is touted as reliable student grub. It\u2019s relatively cheap,\nalmost foolproof (RTFI, people \u2013 we\u2019re Imperialites!) and doesn\u2019t take ages. It\u2019s\nflexible \u2013 you can make it a simple bolognese affair, or slap on a complex sauce\nand bake it in some mythical way passed down to you from a former mafiosi.\nLeftovers keep well, so long as you don\u2019t leave them in some black hole in the\nback of your fridge. And like Elizabeth says, it\u2019s also one of the quickest healthy\nmeals you can prepare so long as you follow a few simple rules (dieters need not\ntoss their heads in disgust. No, really.)\nFirst up, definitely forget your tinned sauces \u2013 some amazing pasta accompaniments can be whipped up in the same time it takes to boil the pasta itself. You\ndon\u2019t need me to tell you about the nasties in pre-made sauces; your wallet will\nthank you for making your own from scratch. Best of all, you get to adjust your\nown seasoning to suit \u2013 try modding the basic sauce recipe below for starters.\nWatch the time of the day. Digesting carbs can sometimes send you into a\nspot of drowsiness, which explains the famed mid-afternoon slump. That\u2019s not a\nbig problem if you\u2019re winding down in the evening; but for lunch I like to balance\nthepastaportionoutwithmoreprotein(whichkeepsyoualertandfull)andveg.\nIt\u2019s easily done in a pasta stir-fry, which is not unlike Chinese fried rice \u2013 just with\npasta instead! That way, you can control the amount of pasta that goes in with\nthe rest of the ingredients.\nThink colourful. I\u2019m a sucker for the creamy chicken and bacon pasta bake\nthat my housemate makes (hey Phil!), but my favourite feel-good penne stir-fry\nincludes a bigger variety of ingredients. Mushrooms, peppers, carrot, peas... the\ncolour from the veg doesn\u2019t just mean nutrition, it looks more enticing!\nFinally, live a little. All things in moderation is the best mantra to go by, so a\nlittle pasta won\u2019t hurt you. Besides, eating pasta triggers a nice dose of feel-good\nserotonin so it\u2019s a great dietary pick-me-up. If you\u2019re on a diet (really?), either\ndecrease the carb portion, or switch out to wholegrain pasta \u2013 it keeps you fuller\nfor longer so you may not need as much, and it\u2019s healthier. See \u2013 you really CAN\nhave your cake (I mean, pasta) and eat it too. Viva la pasta!\nRefreshing Tomato and Basil (Base) Sauce\nSweat some onion and garlic in oil, then bung in pure passata/chopped tomatoes\n(less than half a tin \u2013 the Italians use them too) and bring to the boil. Reduce for 5+\nmins if making a 1-person portion \u2013 if making a bigger batch ahead of time, you\u2019ll\nneed longer. Season with salt/pepper/sugar and some vinegar to taste, then add\nbasil and Basilio\u2019s your uncle. Add chilli flakes for arrabiata, stir in mascarpone for\nstuff that rivals the Sainsbury\u2019s tubs, use other herbs... tweak it as you will.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n10\nA problem of perception\n\u2018d like to perform a small ex-periment. Picture a scientist in\nyour mind. Now answer this:\nwhat gender is your scientist?\nWhat colour is their skin? I\u2019d\nhazard a guess that a large number of\nyou pictured a white male. Mine has a\nbeard too \u2013 and he\u2019s scrunched over\na desk in a solitary room, calculating\nsomething. His clothes are scru\ufb00y,\nand he clearly doesn\u2019t care over-much\nabout his appearance.\nWe all have mental preconceptions.\nOf people, of jobs, and of the way life\nis in general. It\u2019s not really possible to\nget away from that. Nor would the lack\nof them be desirable \u2013 how would we\nbegin to think about anything without\nsomewhere to start from? We can\u2019t remember the properties of everything\nindividually so we have to categorise\nand just remember \u2018if it\u2019s in this category it has these properties\u2019.\nAs scientists, we like to think of ourselves as objective and rational. It\u2019s\nwhat we strive for. But we are humans\nlike everyone else, and sometimes our\nirrationality gets the better of us. A recent study [1] looked into the hiring of\nlab assistants, aiming to determine if\nthere was any gender bias in the way\nthat science departments viewed the\nrelative competence of male and female applicants. hey created a group\nof fake applications, containing the\nsame content, but randomly assigned\nthe names as male or female. he differences were striking: on average,\nmen were consistently judged as being\n\u2018more competent\u2019, and o\ufb00ered higher\nstarting salaries (by about $3500) than\nwomen.\nBut this wasn\u2019t a case of \u2018misogynistic old men\u2019 putting women down.\nhe study found that the gender, and\nindeed age, of the academic judging\nthe candidates had no signi\ufb01cant ef-fect. In other words, women were just\nas likely as men to rate female candidates as \u2018less competent\u2019. Curiously,\ndespite not o\ufb00ering them the job as\nfrequently, both also consistently\nrated female candidates as more \u2018likeable\u2019: given that the CVs were identi-cal, it would seem that this hints at yet\nanother false preconception, though\nin this case working against men.\nRecently, within the Department\nof Physics, a group of students have\nstarted meeting to talk about these\nissues, and questions much wider\nthan that: are there fewer people from\nethnic minorities than there ought to\nbe? What is life like for disabled people who want to pursue science? For\nthe purposes of this article, I\u2019m going\nto focus on women in physics in par-ticular, though much of this extends\nto other sciences and engineering\nequally well.\nhere is strong evidence that far\nfewer women go on to do physics research than in other sciences. In 2006,\nonly 14.78% of PhD students from the\n\u2018Top 50\u2019 departments (as rated by the\nNational Science Foundation) were female [2]. his compared with 33.42%\nand 45.89% for Chemistry and Biology\nrespectively.\nFirst of all, why should we care?\nMany arguments have been proposed\nto explain this. I will address some of\nthem here, and hopefully convince you\nthat this is worth thinking carefully\nabout. One argument that is frequently encountered concerns the relative\nability of males and females in phys-ics. Intelligence is tricky to de\ufb01ne, but\nif we focus on performance in areas\nrelevant to mathematical disciplines\nsuch as physics, then some research\nshows that despite there being no difference in the average ability between\ngenders, males exhibit a greater vari-ance. If you picture a normal distribu-tion, you can see that a consequence\nof this is that there are signi\ufb01cantly\nmore males with very high ability (and\nalso very low) than there are females.\nOne \ufb01gure puts this at twice as many\nmales as females in the top 1% [3].\nDoes this explain the situation? Let\u2019s\nleave aside issues of whether the data\nis applicable and assume that it is for\nthe moment (this is a complicated\narea \u2013 the di\ufb00erence in variability has\nbeen shown to be di\ufb00erent, and even\nreversed, in di\ufb00erent cultures, for example [4]). A very crude comparison\nof \u20182:1 male:female ratio in the top\n1%\u2019 with the 14.78% female PhD students\u2019 might hint that this isn\u2019t su\ufb03cient. More importantly, however, it\nhas been shown that women are less\nlikely to want to pursue careers in sci-ence, independent of their ability [5].\nhis in itself tells us that a di\ufb00erence\nin variability cannot explain the lack\nof women.\nWhich brings us to the second\npoint. Perhaps women just aren\u2019t\nas likely to want to study physics as\nmuch as men? his is an interesting\none, because it is probably true, but\nreally just re-states the question \u2013\nwhy don\u2019t more women want to study\nphysics? he assumption behind this\nargument seems to be that women are\nintrinsically less interested in phys-ics. However, there is some evidence\nthat can be interpreted as suggesting\nthat girls are put o\ufb00 physics at an early\nage. A recent study by the Institute of\nPhysics [6] found that girls educated\nin single-sex schools were up to twice\nas likely to study physics at A-Level:\nan e\ufb00ect which persisted even taking\ninto account social background and\ntype of school. What is it about being educated around boys that makes\ngirls less interested in physics? I don\u2019t\nhave an answer to that, but this seems\nto me to undermine the idea that girls\nare \u2018innately\u2019 less interested, and suggests that something is putting them\no\ufb00.\nFinally, I\u2019ve also heard it suggested\nthat the e\ufb00ect is a hang-over from the\ndays when people were less conscious\nof gender equality, and that it will\ntake time for more women to get into\nphysics. It\u2019s certainly true that we\u2019ve\nmade a lot of progress over the last\nfew decades, but there are problems\nwith this line of reasoning. he \ufb01rst is\nthat recent data doesn\u2019t support this.\nIf it were the case, we would expect\nto see more women in the early stages\nof their academic careers, but in 2006\nthe National Science Foundation\u2019s\n\ufb01gures for the percentage of female\n\u2018Assistant Professors\u2019 at the \u2018Top 50\u2019\ndepartments were 11.15% and 21.47%\nfor physics and chemistry respectively\n[2]. So even if things have improved,\nit would appear that physics has not\nimproved as much as other subjects.\nNow that I\u2019ve raised some objections to these ob-jections, I\u2019d like to\ntalk about why this\nmatters so much\nto me. I began this\narticle by talking\nabout unconscious\nperceptions and\nthis, I believe, is the\nroot of the problem\nfacing physics. I believe this because I\nknow for a fact that\nI hold these perceptions as much as\nanyone else.\nI \ufb01rst noticed this\nwhen one of my lecturers told us about\nthe work of Emmy\nNoether. For those\nwho aren\u2019t familiar with her work,\nEmmy Noether\nis best known for\n\u2018Noether\u2019s heorem\u2019, a mathematical formulation of\nthe link between\nconservation laws\nand symmetries\nin nature. It is a\nbeautiful idea, and\nunderlies much of\nmodern physics. In her day, Noether\nhad to \ufb01ght to be accepted among\nacademics, and at one time could only\nlecture uno\ufb03cially under the name\nof her colleague David Hilbert. However, what struck me is that when I\n\ufb01rst heard about \u2018Noether\u2019s heorem\u2019,\nI assumed \u2018Noether\u2019 must be a man.\nStatistically, this was a reasonable as-sumption. But what bothered me was\nthat I was surprised when I learnt that\nshe was not. Why should I have been\nsurprised? Is it because I don\u2019t regard\nwomen as capable of being as competent as men? I wasn\u2019t consciously\naware of believing that. Counter-intuitively, however, research has shown\nthat those who most care about believing they are objective are in fact\nmore likely to harbour biases [7].\nIf we are capable of being biased\nwithout even realising it, then how\nmuch discrimination is going on under our noses without even being no-ticed? Playing a blame-game and crying \u2018misogynist conspiracy\u2019 will not\nhelp with this. Awareness will. hink-ing about these issues rather than\nhoping they will just go away is the\nonly way to combat our unconscious\nperceptions. I\u2019ve made a lot of points\nhere, and there is so much more to say.\nIf you think I am wrong then I invite\nyou to tear my arguments to pieces.\nAt least we\u2019ll both be thinking about\nit, and I\u2019ll have achieved my goal.\nhe author would like to thank the\nEqual Opportunities Group for the\nmany vibrant discussions which inspired this article, and in particular\nSo\ufb01a Qvarfort and Apostolia Tasoudi\nfor their advice, critique, and encouragement of this particular project.\nStephen Stopyra explores the gender imbalance in physics\nI\nReferences\n[1] C.

It\u2019s understandable that businesses (Imperial is a\nbusiness in a way, as they need to make\nmoney to survive) must not lose money.\nHowever, not every single little part has\nto make money. Some things can just\nbe a service, such as having cheap halls\nnear to campus. Why not just refurbish\nthe halls to the standard they were at\nbefore?

Not to\nhammer the point home too much, but\nbefore the lease runs out the majority of\nAmericans will be too young to remember the iPhone being launched. The list\ngoes on. What Imperial has to do in that\ntime is ask if it can keep paying to rent\nsomething. When you consider that in\nthe past someone like Lord Byron could\nbe born, create a character type so enduring that they are still used all the time\ntoday, and die, all in just over the space\nof time they have, you think that maybe\nwe\u2019ve got a bit soft as a species really.\nCollege has an incredible asset in Evelyn\nGardens; they must use it, don\u2019t lose it.\nThe bars and other such things there\nare not as innocent as it seems.

    "content": "Anonymous\nLove Europe, Hate the EU\nf you really love Europe then\nyou ought to be a Eurosceptic\nby now.\nIt\u2019s been striking to see the\namount of pro-EU articles in\nthese pages over recent weeks. First\nPietro Aronica wrote about the need\nfor a \u2018United States of Europe\u2019, and\nnow Leonardo Ialongo has written\ntwo pieces on \u2018A European Citizenship\u2019 to celebrate the launch of a European Society on campus. Following\nDavid Cameron\u2019s speech in mid-Jan-uary promising a referendum on the\nUK\u2019s membership of the EU, this sudden appearance of propaganda should\nbe of no surprise.\nWhat has surprised me, however, is\nthe level of delusional thinking that\nthese writers and other staunch supporters of the EU have shown.\nLeonardo\u2019s \ufb01rst article discussed the\nnumerous bene\ufb01ts that the UK enjoys\nas part of the EU, such as consumer\nprotection, increased mobility across\nthe continent, and greater power as\na bloc to in\ufb02uence global political is-sues. hese are of course desirable.\nhe problem is that UK citizens feel\nthat these perks do not justify much\nhigher tax rates \u2013 in 2008, total cost\nto the UK of EU membership was estimated at \u00a365 billion. hat\u2019s the equivalent of \u00a31,000 per year for every single person in the country. Given that\nthe UK economy is a complete mess,\nits aging infrastructure is in decline\nand its people are becoming relatively poorer, perhaps they might have a\npoint that the money would be better\nspent at home? If Europhiles were to\nchat with the average British person,\nthey would \ufb01nd that the old clich\u00e9s\nabout how where our scepticism\ncomes from simply aren\u2019t true \u2013 most\npeople couldn\u2019t care less about the lost\nempire, they just want value for their\nmoney, and the EU doesn\u2019t give it.\nLeonardo tells us that this concern is\nmisguided as this money is in the form\nof a loan, and \u2018should therefore be paid\nback\u2019. he key word here is \u2018should\u2019.\nHe overlooks the inconvenient fact\nthat many, nay, most, states cannot\npay back their debts, and we are now\nwitnessing the consequences of this\nacross the world. It won\u2019t change any\ntime soon.\nHis second article supports the introduction of Eurobonds as part of a\n\ufb01scal union, since \u2018more central European oversight on national debt is\nnecessary\u2019. his is a euphemism for\nthe transferral of the power to tax and\nspend from national governments to\nBrussels. It is also remarkably simplistic thinking. In such a scenario, it is\nclear that this would essentially result\nin Germany, the continent\u2019s economic\npowerhouse, deciding how money\nshould be allocated across local econ-omies. It is hard to see this going down\nwell anywhere in Europe, least of all in\nGreece, where Germany has imposed\nausterity as a condition for receiving\nbailouts, and newspaper depictions\nof Angela Merkel in Nazi uniform are\nnow common. But it won\u2019t happen\nanyway, because no national government would ever permanently hand\nover their centuries-old power to tax\nand spend to Brussels. his is because\nin doing so they would themselves become obsolete.\nhis brings us on to the next point,\nwhich is that in fact the Eurozone\u2019s\nmain problem is not economic in na-ture, but one of political legitimacy.\nLeandro correctly notes that the project has been driven by the European\nelite, and has alienated the European\npopulation. He thinks this can be\nsolved by a \u2018process of democratisa-tion of its institutions\u2019. Again, this\nstrikes me as just wishful thinking, because the whole ethos of the EU is an-ti-democratic. he clearest example of\nthis was the forcing-through in 2008\nof the Lisbon Treaty, a resurrection of\nthe deeply unpopular EU Constitution\nwhich was rejected by the electorate in\n2005. Aside from the usual cuts in national sovereignty, the most egregious\naspect of this move was that since the\npeople clearly didn\u2019t want it, the politicians decided that they knew better,\nand quietly changed the terms of the\ntreaty so that it could be passed in\nparliaments, rather than having to go\nthrough irksome referenda. Who in\ntheir right mind would think that this\ncynical attitude could be reversed?\nIt\u2019s clear that what the Eurocrats\nwant is a kind of superstate similar to\nthe USA, as Pietro outlined in his arti-cle. But this idea is nothing more than\na fantasy. Its proponents ignore the\nfact that the USA has a completely different set of circumstances to our con-tinent: they are a single nation-state,\nwhich only came into being as a political entity after a devastating civil war.\nBy contrast, Europe is a disparate region of many nations, each with their\nown cultures, languages, histories\nand levels of economic development.\nIn the utopian world of the Eurocrat,\nEurope\u2019s peoples would forget these\ndi\ufb00erences, and embrace a common\nidentity as, in Leonardo\u2019s words, a \u2018European people\u2019.\nhe problem with this is that no\nsuch people exists \u2013 only millions of\nhumans from di\ufb00erent nations who\nhappen to live in a continent called\nEurope. Although multi-lingual, mobile types like him and I might be able\nto get along well in the cosmopolitan\nworld of Imperial College, that doesn\u2019t\nmean that everybody else in a United\nStates of Europe would. He correctly\nnotes that the EU has played an important role in suppressing the latent\nxenophobic and racist attitudes that\nmany people feel following World War\nTwo. But it is precisely because those\nevils are never far below the surface\nthat we ought to be extremely wary of\nthose who want to forge grand political projects while assuming that peoples from vastly di\ufb00erent backgrounds\nwill get along nicely for the sake of its\ncontinuity. As history has shown, this\nis particularly the case when inequality is rising and living conditions begin\nto decline, as they are across Europe\nwith the gradual movement of wealth\naway from the West towards the developing markets. It is ironic that the\nrecent rise of far right parties across\nEurope, notably in France, Hungary\nand Greece, is in part a reaction to\nthe existence of the EU, rather than in\nspite of it.\nIt is well known that European Societies tend to consist of ex-pupils of\nEuropean Schools, and what interests me is the extent to which these\nschools appear to indoctrinate their\npupils with pro-EU propaganda. he\nUSSR was a very di\ufb00erent institution\nto the EU, but one can\u2019t help being reminded of the way that Soviet schoolchildren were indoctrinated with the\nenlightened principles of MarxismLeninism, even when its disastrous\nresults were clear for all to see outside\nthe classroom. he analogy goes further when you remember that just as\nEurocrats want to create a new \u2018European People\u2019, the Soviets were convinced that they could create a \u2018New\nSoviet Man\u2019 \u2013 a sel\ufb02ess, healthy and\neducated enthusiast for spreading the\nsocialist Revolution. Unlike the USSR,\nthe EU will not slaughter millions in\nthe name of this ideal, but the similarities are certainly instructive. Perhaps it\u2019s just a coincidence that many\nof the EU\u2019s leaders, most notably the\nPresident of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso, are former\nMaoists. Or perhaps not.\nWhy do these people so despise the\nnation-state? I\u2019d like to suggest that\ngraduates of European Schools who\nbecome proto-spokesmen for the EU\nsimply lack a part of their own identity\n\u2013 that same part that Italian people\nget from going to Italian schools, or\nFinnish people get by going to Finnish\nschools. In absence of a school-time\na\ufb03liation with any particular nation,\nthese people \ufb01nd solace in the prospect of a new, European identity, and\nnow want to impose this on the rest of\nus, most of whom are quite happy remaining Italian or Finnish \ufb01rst rather\nthen European.\nBeing a Eurosceptic doesn\u2019t make\nyou xenophobic, and you can still be\na fan of our continent and its peoples\nwithout supporting the EU, as I am. In\nfact, the consequences of greater integration could be far more disastrous\nthan the alternative. Perhaps if you really love Europe then you ought to be\na Eurosceptic by now.\nAn accident waiting\nto happen\n... you can\nstill be a\nfan of our\ncontinent and\nits peoples\nwithout\nsupporting\nthe EU\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n20\nAn anonymous response to the recent comment articles on the\nvirtues of the EU\nI\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\nThe end of aid?\nIn October 2012 the Secretary of State\nfor International Development, Justine Greeing, announced cuts to the\nUK\u2019s \u00a31bn aid programme in India\nwith a view of focussing on a more\n\u2018trade-based\u2019 relationship. More recently during David Cameron\u2019s ska-doodle to India in the middle of February 2013, he praised India\u2019s business\nacumen and strong economic growth\nin recent years and paraded about\nthe UK\u2019s commitment to ease trade\nand travel regulations between itself\nand India which could be seen as a\nconsummation of the UK\u2019s stance to\ndevelopment with India. Across the\npond, the Sullivan Foundation, a high\nlevel international development organisation with political backing from\nformer President George Bush that\ndrew attention and \ufb01nances from the\nhalls of US power, recently closed its\ndoors and now holds a private Africafocussed \ufb01rm. Western companies\nand investors like these are falling\nover backwards to engage in the economic boom that is slowly underway\nin many countries around the world\nthat were more commonly knows as\n\u201cthird-world\u201d.\nFamously, the Economist in 2011\nproduced a brightly designed cover\npage entitled \u201cAfrica Rising\u201d that\nmany contrasted with their\nJune 2001 cover-page story\nof Africa branding it \u201che\nDark Continent\u201d. From\nVietnam to the Myanmar\n(where multinationals are\nmoving their manufacturing\nprocesses to, away from an\nageing and ever more expensive China); from Rwanda to\nKenya, where for more than a decade\nyear-on-year GDP growth is in the\n+10 per cent per annum bracket and\nis mostly non-commodity driven,\neconomies that used to be the underdogs are now beginning to \ufb02ex their\neconomic muscle. hese countries are\ndrawing international liquidity away\nfrom the West that is still licking its\nwounds from the global \ufb01nancial crisis and contracting or stagnating national budgets (in real terms) across\nall sectors; and most interestingly for\nme as a future healthcare pro-fessional, the NHS has not\nescaped the scalpel of the\ngovernment as it looks for\nslack to cut.\nIn the face of all these\nglobal changes and a growing optimism, countries like\nMozambique for example,\nwhich has grown steadily\nat rates of 68 per cent between 1996\nand 2008, still face more than a half\nof their populations living under the\npoverty line of $0.50 a day. he Democratic Republic of Congo is still in the\nmiddle of civil con\ufb02ict, and the recent\nunrest in Mali has done nothing to\nimprove living standards for its peo-ple. here is also a growing scepticism\nthat the positive economic growth\nof recent years has done nothing but\nincrease inequality as Nigerian millionaires party with Kim Kardashian\nin Lagos and the Chinese elite drive\nsome of the most expensive cars in\nthe world in Beijing while community\nhealth workers administering polio\nvaccines are slain in Northern Nigeria\nand the future of China\u2019s rural populace is still in question. With all this\nin mind, what will the future hold for\ninternational development aid, which\nhas been both greatly praised and at\nthe same time accused of holding developing countries back. he panel\ndebate at the Future of Healthcare Development Conference on the 6th of\nMarch in the Imperial College Business School aims to explore this. In attendance will be the A m b a s -sador of Eritrea to\nthe UK among\nexperts in the\n\ufb01eld of international development from a\nvariety of sec-tors. It promises to be a fantastic event!

Some players took the miners\ntradition to steady their hand, merry\nspirits and ignite \ufb01re in our strictly\nathletic bodies. Golf brought home a\n3-1 victory.\nNetball was going to be tense this\nyear, with a tightly contested match\nlast year that resulted in the RSM losing for the \ufb01rst time. he RSM girls\nhad prepared well but CSM had obviously still been training hard. After\nthe third quarter the RSM had built up\na 21-14 lead and were looking domi-nant. CSM put in a storming last quar-ter, but luckily RSM held out for a narrow winning margin of 27-25.\nhen came Saturday\u2019s activities. At\nan unsociable hour of 9am the Ladies\nHockey pushed-back, with the supporters already preparing themselves\nagainst the weather with trusty beer\njackets. RSM were dictating play winning successive short corners but failing to convert. Just before half time\nGigi managed to scored an amazing\nreverse stick goal into the bottom cor-ner. However as was a common fate of\nthe Bottle Match this year CSM came\nback \ufb01ghting and got a lucky goal, with\nthe RSM failing to convert their multiple opportunities the result ended in\na draw, meaning that CSM retained\nthe cup.\nhe men\u2019s hockey was up next, this\nproved to be much more tense than\nprevious encounters. he ball moving quickly from end to end but some\nbrilliant defence from Jonney Jones,\nFreddie BM Briggs and Harry Fisher\nand some dramatic saves from Keeper\nJonney kept the CSM attack at bay.\nHalf time was 0-0 and looked promis-ing. Early in the second half a save on\nthe line unfortunately came o\ufb00 a foot\nand gave CSM a penalty \ufb02ick and a 1-0\nlead. he game was so close and this\nwas the only goal, hopefully next year\nwe can right the score line.\nSaturday had not had the best of\nstarts but the supporters make the day\nenjoyable for all. he additions of a\nburger van helping to keep everyone\ngoing for the all important rugby.\nhe football was a tricky match for\nthe RSM team and the strength of the\nCSM through the mid\ufb01eld just gave\nthem too many chances on goal, despite the valiant e\ufb00ort from the RSM\nkeeper. he \ufb01nal result being a disappointing 4-0 loss, however with\nsome key players returning from years\nabroad next year we hope to take a\nstrong team down to Cambourne next\nyear.\nFinally the Rugby! With an emphatic\nvictory last year the RSM didn\u2019t know\nwhat to expect from CSM this year.\nhe RSM started well breaking the\nCSM defence and putting them on\nedge but some scramble defence just\nsaving CSM. A turn in play gave CSM\na penalty and they took an unexpected\n3-0 lead. heir points were quickly answered by a try from James Cox whose\npace and kicking was just too much\nfor CSM to handle. he rugby became\nhazy for some supporters but all I can\nsay is that we were all over them running in tries from Robbie Cowan and\nAli Jones. CSM did manages to sneak\nin a try in the second half making their\nscore more respectable. Fred White\nwho had been dangerous all game,\ncausing trouble on the wing got a try\nat the death and bringing the Bottle\nhome! Credit must be given to Captain James Scaife who lead the team\non the \ufb01eld and made some tough\ntactical substitutions during the game.\nAlso to Henry Bleech for organising\nthe weekend so brilliantly .\n\n"

Maybe a potential employer, your\nexaminers or even\nsomeone you have taken a fancy to?\nDo you often \ufb01nd yourself questioning just what is even going on in your\nown head? Neuroscientists are planning on possibly solving the mysteries of the brain mapping as a means\nto treat neurodegenerative disorders,\nas opposed to giving you an edge in\nthat job interview in the city, but it is\nexciting nonetheless. However, where\nis the catch, or rather, the cost?\nhe Human Connectome Project is\nan e\ufb00ort currently underway to build\na complete network map of the brain;\nthat is, it will be looking at the anatomical and functional connections\nbetween parts of the brain to create a\ndigital model at a scale never explored\nbefore. Upon its launch in 2009, the\nProject aims to shed new light on connectivity patterns in the brain to perhaps provide an insight into how to\ntreat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s\nor even schizophrenia. In a population that is now facing an aging issue,\nsuch treatments are becoming increasingly essential for healthcare for\nthe future, although how the Project\nwill provide a direct platform to this\nis unclear.\nhe Project is being pursued by\nmultiple components of the National\nInstitutes of Health, with the aim to\ncollate information together to form\nthe complete model. hese are split\ninto two consortia: one is the WUMinn consortium between Washington University and the University\nof Minnesota, who are studying the\nbrain structure itself in accordance\nto genetic and behavioural data. he\nother is the MGH/Harvard-UCLA\nconsortium between Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of California,\nwhere they are attempting to optimise\nMRI technology to give a greater spatial resolution when it comes to neurological imaging \u2013 not necessary to\nview individual neurons, but as close\nas they can get to that.\nhis is by no means a cost e\ufb00ective\nfeat. he possibility of monetary support coming from billions of federal\nfunds from the American government\nhas been sparked by rumours that it\nmay be included in Obama\u2019s federal\nbudget proposal, which is expected to\nbe con\ufb01rmed later this month. With\nthe Human Genome Project costing\naround $3.8 billion dollars alone, this\nproject, with signi\ufb01cantly more costly\ninvestigative techniques such as MRI,\ncould skyrocket in price and this may\nultimately come from the pockets of\nthe hardworking American.\nHowever, despite this phenomenal\ncost, the excitement in the scienti\ufb01c\ncommunity is tangible. he American\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nScience (AAAS) this month is one of\nthe largest scienti\ufb01c non-pro\ufb01t societies globally, whose contributions\nto the scienti\ufb01c community includes\nthe publication the established journal Science. he AAAS is highly in\ufb02uential in terms of endorsement for\nwhat may be the next big thing, and\nthis month the AAAS showcased\nthe emerging science of connectom-ics (studying connections) as one to\nwatch, including this project.\nBut does the project deserve such\nhype? he Human Genome Project\nwas heralded as something that will\n\u201cchange everything.\u201d Indeed it did,\nbut through subsequent research\nbased on the incomplete three billion\nletter sequence, that is still ongoing.\nNo doubt the Human Connectome\nProject will follow a similar path \u2013\nshould the project be completed, only\nthen can research begin to truly \ufb01nd\npossible cures for neurodegenerative\ndiseases.\nUnlike the Human Genome Project\nhowever, how reliant future research\nin neuroscience is on this project\u2019s\ncompletion is unclear; unless the\nMGH/Harvard-UCLA consortium\ncan develop a greater resolution in\nMRI technology, the project will still\nbe based on the imaging technologies already available in neuroscience,\nwhich can be seen as rather crude in\nnature as it is. herefore, is there a\nbetter way to spend all of this money\nin combating these diseases in a more\ndirect manner than that requiring the\nwhole mapping of the brain? For now,\nit seems not.\nShould it be successful, the Project\nwill no doubt be hitting the front of\nnewspapers soon and hopefully will\nbe the neurological equivalent to the\nHuman Genome Project in regards to\nfunction. It very much deserves to be\nso based on its potential cost, but it\nwill still only merely be the beginning\nof a much awaited route to deeper\nneurological understanding; the hard\nwork will not end here. It could take\ndecades more before therapeutic\ntreatments are found for neurodegen-erative diseases, and centuries more\nbefore we can actually read the minds\nof teachers, bosses or classmates. For\nnow, we may have to let science \ufb01ction have that prerogative, and keep\nour \ufb01ngers crossed that the Human\nConnectome Project will be a success.\nIn a viral video released last week\nfrom the website www.upworthy.com,\nRichard Kaner and Maher El-Kady of\nthe University of California, Los Angeles revealed that they have discovered a cheap and e\ufb03cient new way\nof manufacturing graphene, in a way\nwhich could lead to the development\nof a\ufb00ordable graphene-based capacitors and batteries.\nheir method (also published in\nNature Communications) involves\ndepositing a \ufb01lm of graphite oxide on\na plastic surface and then irradiating\nit with a laser \u2013 they used a standard\nDVD and LightScribe DVD burner.\nMuch more than merely creating a\nsheet of graphene, this process can\nbe used to inscribe graphene circuits\nin the insulating graphite oxide layer\nwith a resolution of 20\u03bcm; a method\nwhich could be scaled up to industrially produce \ufb02exible electronics.\n\"Traditional methods for the fabrication of micro-supercapacitors\ninvolve labor-intensive lithographic\ntechniques that have proven di\ufb03cult\nfor building cost-e\ufb00ective devices,\nthus limiting their commercial ap-plication,\" El-Kady said. \"Instead, we\nused a consumer-grade LightScribe\nDVD burner to produce graphene\nmicro-supercapacitors over large areas at a fraction of the cost of traditional devices. Using this technique,\nwe have been able to produce more\nthan 100 micro-supercapacitors on a\nsingle disc in less than 30 minutes, using inexpensive materials.\"\nGraphene\u2019s supercapacitive ability has been under investigation for a\nwhile. he UCLA researchers discovered that by embedding an electrolyte\nlayer on their inscribed graphene,\nthey could produce micro-superca-pacitors with the energy density of\nlithium ion batteries, though unlike\nbatteries, they can charge in a matter\nof seconds and are far less bulky and\nheavy.\n\"he integration of energy-storage\nunits with electronic circuits is challenging and often limits the miniaturization of the entire system,\" said\nKaner. \"his is because the necessary\nenergy-storage components scale\ndown poorly in size and are not well\nsuited to the planar geometries of\nmost integrated fabrication process-es.\"\nKaner\u2019s team are now looking for\npartners in industry to produce gra-phene supercapacitors on a large\nscale. While practical applications for\nthese may yet be far away, they could\neventually replace current batteries,\nleading to \ufb02exible, wearable electronic devices and phones, laptops or\neven cars that could be charged in a\nfew seconds.\nLove Science?\nOr want to be Brian Cox?

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH 27\nThe Imperial\nFringe puts on a\nbanging show\nWhat happens when two worlds\ncollide? This is the question Imperial Fringe attempted to answer\nlast Thursday, when they put on\nThe Arts Experiment, a series of\nexhibits exploring the close links\nbetween art and science. By explaining the science between many\nof Imperial\u2019s favourite pastimes\nthe organisers were able to show\nthat the worlds of culture and research were a lot closer than many\nof us may think.\nAt the heart of the event lay\nImperial\u2019s student societies, who\nteamed up with researchers in order to answer thought-provoking\nquestions such as \u201cHow do dancers keep their balance?\u201d This question was answered by neurologist\nDr. Barry Semmungal, who measured the brain activity of members\nof both IC Dance Society and IC\nRowing in response to spinning in\ncircles. It turns out that dancing\nhad led to the brain adapting to\nconditions that might cause dizzi-ness. Who knew?\nAlthough these questions may\nnot seem like the basis of vital\nscientific research, one of the\nbeauties of the event was how it\nshowed that attempting to answer\nsuch simple questions has led to\nmany fascinating scientific discov-eries. And the exhibition did not\njust deal with scientific research.\nBoth the IC String Society, and the\nChamber Music Society explored\nthe physics behind music, showing us how vibrations in a cello\u2019s\nstrings can translate into a beautiful melody. This explanation of the\nscience behind the arts exemplifies\nhow closely the two are linked. It\nneedn\u2019t be one or the other.\nThe arts can be an extremely\nuseful medium for getting the\npublic more interested in science,\na proposition currently being explored by Beautiful Science, which\npromotes collaboration between\nartists and biomedical research-ers. Developments in biomedical\nscience, particularly in imaging\ntechnologies, has led to incredibly\nstunning images coming out of the\nresearch lab, which can then be\nused to encourage people to read\nabout the sciences. Their exhibit\nincluded not only pieces of art,\nbut also gave visitors the chance\nto create their own through paper\nmarbling, which relies on the special properties of inks and paints.\nFred Fyles Writer While my own attempt was a far\ncry from Picasso or Pollock, the\ndisplay showed how science can\nhelp the artist create gorgeous im-ages.\nOther displays showed us that,\nthanks to cutting edge scientific\nresearch, the future is now. The\nMusic Technology Society were\nexhibiting the Retractable, a musical table that produced sounds\ndepending on which blocks were\nplaced upon its surface. Such developments help us explore how\nmusic may be produced in the fu-ture, as computers become more\nand more integral to the arts; just\nover a year ago Icelandic musician\nBj\u00f6rk released Biophilia, which\nfeatures a series of apps exploring\nthe subjects of the songs, making\nit the world\u2019s first \u2018app album\u2019. The\nway music is being made is chang-ing, and the Fringe shows us just\nhow exciting the developments\ncan be.\nPersonally, my favourite exhibit\nwas Nao, a dancing robot who was\nclothed in spray-on textiles by IC\nFashion Society. Its balance may\nhave been a bit precarious, but\nNao was able to both dance on its\nown, and copy the dance moves\nof the audience, making for some\namusing interactions. The spray-on clothing, developed at Imperial\nCollege, was also particularly in-teresting, as it displayed a technology that has an enormous potential\nboth in fashion and in medicine.\nIts use in design is something that\ncould become more and more popular in the coming years.\nWe are currently living within a\npolitical climate where the arts are\nunder attack. As the government\ntries to reduce the deficit, their\nfirst targets for austerity measures\nare often culture and the arts, with\nsome councils cutting arts funding\ncompletely. These actions, combined with the increased focus on\ngetting students interested in sci-ence, have led to a culture in which\narts and science are often seen as\ncompetitors. This should not be\nthe case.\nImperial Fringe have shown us\njust how much these two worlds\ncan have in common, and how vital\nthe arts can be as a source of inspiration for science. If the government\u2019s radical measures continue,\nwe could soon be left in a world\nwhere culture no longer flour-ishes, and this Arts Experiment\nhas shown us some of the amazing\nthings we could miss out on.\nhere is an underground space near\nBaker Street that feels a lot like a\nbaroque sci-\ufb01 future. he half-light\nis illuminated by occasional \ufb02ashes\nof neon. Blue and green lasers strafe\nthe ceiling and an eerie soundscape\nof ambient electronic squawks and\nwhirring servos greets the intrepid.\nSkulls in mechatronic legs stalk the\nspace and glowing orbs shimmer\nwith undulating constellations of\ncolour.\nhe Kinetica Art Fair, now in its\n\ufb01fth incarnation is dedicated to some\noften underrated genres: kinetic,\nelectronic and new media art. he\nfair often features the work of design\nstudents or reformed engineers, well\nplaced to respond to societies accelerating mutability, which stems from\nthe insatiable advance of technol-ogy. Where philosophical depth was\nlacking the pure visual thrill of the\nrobots, holograms and illusions that\npack the space are sure to at least tit-illate.\nLike many commercial shows there\nare hits and misses. he big names,\nshowcased at the entrance like Simon\nGudgeon and Titia Ex are, as is often\nthe case, the least rewarding. However hidden in dark corners there are\na number of pieces that succeed either through craft or design.\nOne big theme of the show is in-teraction. For example, in an installation by David John Roswell,\nviewers are invited to remotely manipulate puppets though their own\nbody movements. Rainbow Winter\u2019s\nfashion pieces make use of a new\nwave of smart textiles that respond\nto their environments. One of her\ntwo dresses on display is covered in\nstreaks of lightning that dart across\nthe surface in response to ambient\nsound. he e\ufb00ect is faintly mesmer-ising and has earned her increasing\nand well deserved media attention\nfrom the likes of Wired and Channel\n4.\nWhen viewers are not being invited to take part in the works, they\nare often being tricked. he obsession with optical illusion can be\nseen everywhere. One mindboggling\npiece, Die Falle, from Gregory Barsamian makes reference to Karl Jung\u2019s\ntheories on dreams. His huge zoetrope dominates the space around\nit, making use of a strobe light and\na rotating frame to produce a seeming impossible 3D illusion of a dream\nsequence.\nChris Levine\u2019s work Angel is one\nof the most apparently unassuming.\nUtilising the \u2018persistent visual echo\nof blipvert technique\u2019 the viewer is\ntreated to glimpses of a \ufb01gure emerg-ing, seemingly magically, from your\nperipheral vision of a simple strip\nlight. he phenomenon is so alien\nthat it really does momentarily shake\nbelief in the tangible in a profoundly\ndisturbing manner.\nhe show runs all this weekend and\nwill also feature scheduled performance pieces. If the show by INERE\nis anything to go by, these will comprise of baffling medleys of abstract\ndigital sound and audio.\nI feel it should be mentioned that,\nat the press viewing, the techno-wizardry of many of the pieces was\ntoo often interrupted by overloaded\npower supplies, spasticated robotics and the faint smell of burning\n\ufb01laments. Hopefully by the time the\nshow opens to the general public\nthese glitches will have been ironed\nout and you too can make the trip\nto the depths of cybernetic madness\nunafraid.\nKiller rob-arts attack\nMeredith Thomas Editor\nMan follows\nApple Maps\ninto the warp\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\nRory Fenton\nLosing My Religion\nhere is nothing more\nliberating than simply\nbeing yourself. here is\nprobably also nothing\nharder. For many across\nthe UK struggling to leave their family\u2019s religion, this is exactly the challenge they face everyday. I know \u2013 I\nwas one of them.\nRaised Catholic in Northern Ireland, religion was never sold to me\nas a matter of conscience, it was a\nmatter of identity. To lose my faith\nwould be to lose a part of myself. So\nwhen I started to doubt my faith as a\nteenager and later again as a student,\nI tried to sweep my doubts under the\ncarpet, embarrassed that someone\nmight see what seemed to me a failure\nto believe. All I had ever known was\nCatholicism and I had learnt to view\natheism through Catholic eyes. To be\natheist, I believed, was to lose hope,\nto lose morality and to lose purpose.\nSo at \ufb01rst the realisation that I did not\nbelieve the religion of my parents was\nfar from liberating: it felt like an ill-ness.\nSo I sought a cure for my atheism.\nI became heavily involved in Catholic\ngroups, attending mass twice a week\nand going abroad on pilgrimage. I focussed on the parts of my religion I\ndid believe in, such as charity, and told\nmyself that belief in the rest would\nsurely come. I remember being on a\nretreat, aged 19, with the intention of\n\ufb01nally deciding that I believed in God.\nLooking back, it does seem incredible\nthat I would head to the countryside\nwith a religious group with the intention of believing in a God I wasn\u2019t sure\nexisted. I spent the weekend reading\nnon-stop through Catholic apologetics but yet again I could only agree\nwith the call to be a moral person and\neven then felt things weren\u2019t as black\nand white as they were presented to\nme. Eventually I realised that to believe would require not a book but a\nleap of faith. To simply, blindly, accept what the Church said to be true.\nI had to believe.\nBut I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t because I\ndidn\u2019t. Catholicism went against my\nbeliefs, it went against who I was and\nin truth I wasn\u2019t a Catholic. his realisation was not the liberation it is\nfor some; it was a grim acceptance.\nBut through chance, I heard of hu-manism. Actually, I heard about it\nthrough a priest who was criticising\nit: \u201chey arrogantly wish to live good\nlives without God.\u201d hat sounded\nperfect.\nVery often at College we hear from\nreligious societies promoting converts to their religion, but how often\ndo we hear from those we have left it?\nhis Tuesday the newly formed Imperial Atheists, Secularists and Humanists Society is proud to host Alom\nT\nShaha, born in Bangladesh and raised\nin London in a Muslim family, to talk\nabout his experience as an \u201capostate\u201d\nas the author of he Young Atheist\u2019s\nHandbook. he purpose of the talk is\nnot to gloat at Islam, Muslims or at\nany religion or religious people but to\nprovide a voice for those who, like a\nyounger Alom and a younger me, are\nuncomfortable in their religion but\ndon\u2019t feel able to express this.\nToo often we hear only from the\nfully convinced \u2013 the Richard Dawkinses and priests, rabbis and imams\nof our world. he doubtful majority\ndeserve their voice too. hrough this\nevent I hope that the doubters might\nbegin to feel more comfortable in\ntheir own shoes, knowing that there\nare many more who share and have\nshared this experience. here really\nis nothing more liberating than being\nyourself, here\u2019s hoping more people\ncan experience this for themselves.\nRory Fenton on growing up faithless in a Catholic country\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE IMPERIAL MEDICALS\n\u201cAN EXPLOSIVE CLASH,\nTHRILLING ENTERTAINMENT AND\nREAL EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT ACTION!\u201d\nLU C KY F O R W H O?\nVA R S I T Y\nV E N G E A N C E\n13.03.13\n/SPORTIMPERIAL\nMATCH TICKETS ARE FREE FOR IMPERIAL STUDENTS IF REGISTER IN ADVANCE!\nGET YOURS TODAY AT:\nWWW.IMPERIAL.AC.UK/SPORTS/VARSITY/TICKETS\njpr williams cup rugby match kick off 19.30 at the stoop stadium, twickenham\n\n"

Inside centre Lucy Olli\ufb00\nhad hold of the ball inside Surrey\u2019s\n22 and made an excellent o\ufb04oad\nover the heads of Surrey players to\nCarolanne Vouriot who ran in support and evaded several tackles to go\nover the line on the wing. In di\ufb03cult\nconditions against the wing, kicker\nLana Lee made an impressive conversion attempt, which unfortunately hit\nthe posts. After this missed attempt,\nLana would go on to convert all the\nother tries scored.\nAt the restart, Pip Heggie caught\nthe ball running full tilt and broke\nseveral tackles to advance into Surrey\u2019s half. Following several powerful scrums, Imperial were awarded a\npenalty which was taken quickly by\nscrum half, Kath Fok, took advantage\nof Surrey\u2019s slow reactions and poor\norganisation to go over and score. In\nfact, this same trick would be pulled\no\ufb00 by Kath in a later try.\nFor the rest of the \ufb01rst 40 minutes,\nImperial dominated and camped inside Surrey\u2019s half. With ball in hand\nfollowing the restart, another try was\nscored when the ball was passed out\ninto the backs where Lucy, Carolanne\nand Amy Humphreys broke the line\nand ran circles around Surrey\u2019s wingers and put Lucy in over the line under the posts.\nhe game gave Imperial the opportunity to try several di\ufb00erent combi-nations. Both Charlie Stephens and\nJuliette Lennon were called to play\nfor both the backs and forwards. By\nhalf time, the score stood at 54-0 and\nthe forward pack were able to experiment with short lineouts from Lana\nas hooker. Just inside the 22, the ball\nwent to Sarah Burns who powered\nover the line. Unfortunately, the referee deemed that the ball had been\nheld up.\nBefore second half went under-way, the referee explicitly told Imperial that he would be stricter with the\nwhistle and also reduce the half to 30\nminutes. Surrey were able to respond\nand with penalties going against Imperial, the opposition \ufb01nally put Imperial on the defensive. he ball was\nturned over with Charlie and Sarah\nBurns both ripping the ball o\ufb00 the\nopposition on several occasions and\nKath broke from deep with a kick\nchase that saw her score again under\nthe posts despite being impeded o\ufb00\nthe ball. he other second half try\nwas scored by Carolanne who demonstrated her 7s background to evade\ntacklers in a run that spanned half the\npitch.\nForward of the match was tightly\ncontested with special mention to\nforwards Charlie and Pip and Carolanne in the backs. Ultimately the\nhonours were awarded to Sarah and\nKath. his result puts Imperial at the\ntop of BCUS 2A and setting up the\nremaining \ufb01xtures of the season as an\nexciting battle for promotion.\nCharlie Stephens Sports Writer\nDriving Lessons For Imperial Students\n\u2022A special offer for Imperial students\nfrom Denis Smyth\n\u2022Driving Standards Agency (DSA)\nAccredited Instructor\n\u2022Mock Test Examiner\n5 Driving Lessons for\n\u00a395\n\"Denis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from completely\ninexperienced and utterly hopeless driving up to the standard to pass their test.

A big part of Marrow, a society that\nexists in 40 universities including Imperial, is to raise awareness regarding\nthe work that Anthony Nolan does to\nmatch stem cell or bone marrow donors to blood cancer patients. he ultimate aim of Marrow Societies is to\nraise funds to support the work of Anthony Nolan, and to encourage people\nto sign up to be on the donor register.\nhere are many things in life that\nwe take for granted or are ignorant\nof if they do not address our contemporary personal needs. If I were\ndiagnosed with cancer and needed a\nlife-saving transplant I would expect\nthe infrastructure that could \ufb01nd my\npotential match to be in place and ef-fective. And yet as my current healthy,\nnon-cancerous self, I had zero knowledge about the origins of the donor\nregister or the organisation responsible for managing and expanding the\nregister until about a year ago\u2026\nhe concept of a register was borne\nin the early 1970s by a woman called\nShirley Nolan who was desperate\nto \ufb01nd a bone marrow donor for\nher young son, Anthony. Anthony\nwas born with Wiscott Aldrich syn-drome, a rare condition that left\nhis life dependent on a bone marrow transplant. At the time, matches\nwere made mainly through relatives\nas it was only in 1973 that unrelated\ndonors began to be used. However,\nthere was no system in place to locate\na donor to match the patient at hand.\nAnthony\u2019s mother campaigned for\nthe creation of a bone marrow register to do just this; although it was set\nup in 1974, she lost her eight year old\nson for lack of a match in 1979. he\nconnectedness inherent in transplant\nprocedures today is the legacy of a\nyoung child and his visionary, loving\nmother. Nine years later a team of students formed the \ufb01rst-ever Marrow\nSociety in the University of Nottingham in response to the loss of a friend\nto leukaemia.\nCancer is a personal subject. Cancer evokes di\ufb00erent thoughts and associations in di\ufb00erent people, and so\nI\u2019m banking on you readers to forgive\nme for inevitably sharing my own take\nand experiences with the subject. I\nwas introduced to Anthony Nolan\nthrough a scheme of theirs entitled\n\u2018Register and Be a Lifesaver\u2019, or R&Be,\nfor which I attended a training day at\nthe charity headquarters. he scheme\nwas instigated by Adrian Sudbury, a\nyoung journalist whose life had been\ntransformed following a leukaemia di-agnosis. hroughout the course of his\nillness he relayed the details of his battles with cancer in an excruciatingly\nhonest way on an online blog, \u2018Baldy\u2019s\nBlog\u2019, which accumulated thousands\nof readers all over the world. At the\ntraining we were shown a clip of Adrian which followed the deterioration\nof his health over time. We learned\nhow he had loved to play football,\nhow he had dreamed of becoming a big-time journalist,\nand how his life as he\nhad known it had\nstopped after\nhe had\nchecked\nhimself\ninto hospital upon\nfeeling incredibly tired\none day whilst\nwashing the dishes.\nHad you been there,\nyou would have noticed\nthe pace of the background\nmusic slowing down and the\nframes losing colour and movement\nin a build-up to what you are primed\nto know is a tragic ending. At that\npoint I remember looking over to the\nspeaker who, moments later, exposed\nhimself as Adrian\u2019s father. here was\na mutual respect in the room, a room\nwhich seemed to purge this man of his\ndeep sorrow and regret for the time\nhe was up there speaking about his\nfootballer-journalist-cancerous son.\nHe was doing everything in his power\nto educate people about blood cancers and what they could do to help\non behalf of his deceased son who had\nmade promotion of public education,\nparticularly teenagers, his dying mis-sion.\nHumbling experiences lead us to re\ufb02ect upon the value and signi\ufb01cance\nof our own philosophies of life and\nour actions; of our littleness in the\ngrand scheme of life; and of our vulnerability to unpredictable external\nforces. his causes us to better appreciate any opportunities we do have to\ncontrol and impact not only our\nown lives but those around us\nin need of extra support.\nIf I haven\u2019t appealed to\nyour sense of altruism\nby now I can only suggest you get out of\nthe lab more often\n\u2013 oh, the joys\nof drawing on\nImperial ste-reotypes! To\nthe rest of\nyou I propose the\nLondon\nm a r -rowthon, a\n5 or 10km run \u2013 or\nwalk, or waddle, or limped voyage (apply as appropriate) \u2013 around\nThe marrowthon\nHewa Khalilifar dresses up as a superhero, and so should you...\nY\nHyde Park. he theme is superheroes\nbut for those of us who cannot bring\nourselves to presume the identity of a\n\ufb01ctional character, normal sports attire will su\ufb03ce. here is a choice of\nroute, the shorter of which, sitting\nhere grease-stained from my Roast\nChicken Walkers, I feel truly thankful\nfor. To the pragmatics, a former participant commented, \u201cIf, like\nme, your outdoor\nr u n n i n g\ntakes a slight\ndip over the winter, and\nyou\u2019re just starting to pick it up\nagain, this is well worth adding to your\ncalendar\u201d. And for the competitors,\nthe fastest times and best dressed will\nreceive prizes. Last year these were\nlaptops and iPods! For those who just\nwant hard evidence to rub in the face\nof the haters who doubted that they\ncould run a marathon, everyone receives a goody bag and medal. And\nlastly, for those self-con-scious of looking like a\none-legged duck\nor other\nform of\nnon-human in\nthe process of endurance\nsport, there are opportunities to marshall for a couple of hours.\nhe Marrow maxim is, \u2018as long as\nblood cancer is still around, we have\nto make people aware that they can\ncure it\u2019. For every one person Anthony\nNolan can provide a donor for, there\nis one person who misses out on a\nsecond chance at life. Together we can\nchange these odds. We can leave our\nfootprint on cancer survival.\n\n"

Other plans include still not looking into the heat\nin the Library, spitting on students\nas they walk out of labs, and making sure computers never connect to\nprinters.\nIn a shocking twist of events, the\nhalls at North Acton turned out to\njust be part of a bigger \u2018strategic review\u2019. A spokesperson said: \u201chis is\na fantastic opportunity for Imperial.\nWe are now global leaders in the \ufb01eld\nof education, despite the fact that we\ndon\u2019t give you useful feedback from\nlab reports and projects\u201d going on to\nsay that \u201cimproving those sorts of issues would just be really silly\u201d.\nhe plans are thought to be aimed\nat distinguishing Imperial from UCL,\nRap Lyric of\nthe Week\n\u201cBy all means,\nI keep my balls clean\u201d\nBy all means? There is only one\nmeans, and that is basic personal\nhygiene. Just have a shower every\nday and you balls will be clean.\nPlus, nobody wants to hear about\nyour scrotal cleansing regiment\nwhen walking down the road with\ntheir headphones in. Keep this shit\nto yourself in the future.\nDevin the Dude: \u201cKush Is\nMy Cologne\u201d\nThink you\u2019re funny? Maybe you\nare. Or, more likely, people are\njust laughing at you. Send stuff\nin: felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAre you happy?\nIt is all too easy to twist and fold the\nworld into a sweet smelling version\nof what it really is. A stolen moment\nof intimacy can seem an incapsulat-ing whirlwind of passion, desire, and\nsexual supremacy. To an outsider,\nhowever, things can appear a little\ndi\ufb00erently. You might, for example,\nstumble into your \ufb02atmates very own\nwhirlwind of passion not to see a couple pushing the boundaries of human\ndesire, but instead two greasy drunken failures, who despite his valiant efforts to thumb in a quarter-chub, \ufb01nd\nthemselves so painfully alone. You\nscan the room for a condom wrapper.\nNope. Poor kid hasn\u2019t got a fucking\nchance.\nPeople insist on forever seeking the\nmost positive outlook on life, and yet\nseem so bitterly disappointed when\nthings don\u2019t work out as they ex-pected. Reality is all too real for these\nverity-phobes, who proudly march\nonwards through the steaming piles\nof shit that life endlessly throws at us\nonly to come out the other side wondering why they have a nasty taste in\ntheir mouths.\nWe see this delusional behaviour\nthroughout society. Critics forever\nponce on about food, relentlessly picking apart a dish as if eating it is some\nholy grail of human experience, rather\nthan what it is. Ingestion. he \ufb01rst\nchapter of a horrible book in which\nthe main character enters the damp\nmouth-hole of a greedy machine, has\nall the goodness sucked out of them,\npasses through 5 sphincters and ends\nup spinning down a \ufb01lthy tube to join\nthe rest of their unfortunate comrades\ndeep within the steaming mess of\nLondon\u2019s Victorian sewer system.\nWhen the sequel to 50 Shades was\nannounced, the sound of wet Mum\nbeans around the world simultaneously quivering in pre-schlick joy\nPlans will \u2018revolutionise education\u2019\ncould be heard from space. Why? Because in the book things are so much\nmore interesting than their actual,\nmiserable lives, and their husbands\nare far more beige and pie-driven than\nChristian Grey.\nBut fear not, mortals! For true happiness can be found in reality. Accept\nthat things won\u2019t always work out\nas expected, and seek joy in the little things. So the next time you\u2019re on\nyour knees in a toilet cubicle, feeling a\nstranger\u2019s love juice burning the back\nof your throat and wondering how\nthe fuck it came to this, ask yourself \u2013\ndoes it really taste so bitter?\nIf semen be the food of love, eat on. As Shakespeare\nalmost said or something\nhey probably don\u2019t take hygiene too\nseriously. hen again, that goes for\nmost Imperial people. hey presume\nit will be a \u2018conversation starter\u2019 or\nsome other drivel. he clue here is that\nthey feel that they are so unspeakably\ndull that they need something to remind them how to make conversation.\n\u201cOh hi I went to watch a band that actually only made one song I like in a\nmuddy \ufb01eld in England\u201d. Not exactly\ngoing to get the heart pumping with\nexcitement and sexual attraction, is it.\nMost likely they will attempt to tell\nyou over-exaggerated and usually\nmade up stories about how wild it was\nwhen they went. If they are wearing a\nReading and Leeds wristband then assume that they are either 16 or just a\nbit slow.\nSome are repeat o\ufb00enders.

His art is full of poetry, sometimes literally and his\nwordplaysarechildishbutcertainlynotnaiveorinnocent.Checkout\nhis website http://www.terencekoh.com. Not only is his art and poetry available there, but he also occasionally sells drawings for cheap\n(andtheywillbeworthalotsomeday).\nCharlotte Jarvis is one of a growing number of contemporary\nartists who are collaborating with scientists and integrating\nscientific ideas into their work. For example, her work with\nthe Netherlands Proteomics Centre resulted in the insertion\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into the genetic information of an apple \u2013 you can read into it all the\nforbidden fruit that you want. Jarvis works in a variety of different media. She also organises mad dinner-parties (hence\nher website http://www.artforeating.co.uk) within which\none can fully enter into the artist\u2019s world of choice \u2013 the naive outlook of a child, a trashy Las Vegas or The Odyssey have\nall been themes.\nAlex Russell Flint is a rare thing, a contemporary British realist.\nHe produces beautifully crafted, technically brilliant, soulful oil\npaintings. He splits his time between London and Argenton-Chateau in France, where he apparently holes up in a former school\nhouse. He has painted commissions for the Duke of Gloucester\nbut is still relatively unknown. Despite his classical style Flint\u2019s\nwork has an intangible modern twist. His personal work features\nsensitive, intimate portraits, generally of females and nudes,\nwhich are rich in texture and expression. The subdued tone often\nbelies a depth and romantic narrative to his painting in which the\nviewer can wilfully lose themselves.\n7\n8\n9\n10\nMay the farce be\nwith you, young one\n\u201cNo. I am your father,\u201d is a line that\nhas gone down in \ufb01lm history. It is\nat this point that Luke Skywalker \ufb01nally confronts Darth Vader, his arch\nenemy, and, as we \ufb01nd out from that\nimmortal line, his biological father.\nWould the moment have been ruined\nby an eager audience yelling out \u201cOH\nNO YOU\u2019RE NOT!\u201d directly after? As\nif! his is Andromedan Nights, DramSoc\u2019s latest performance, a farcical\nsci-\ufb01 pantomime written by Imperial\u2019s own Owain Jones.\nPantomime and farce are always\nto be approached carefully by direc-tors. he strength of the performance\nrelies almost entirely on how much\nenergy the actors have and how well\nthey perform physically. With enough\n\u2018oomph\u2019 the play is a riot, but without\nit everything falls depressingly \ufb02at,\nwith little able to salvage the remains.\nSo what did I get when I went to the\ndress rehearsal, the night before the\n\ufb01rst \u2018o\ufb03cial\u2019 performance?\nI got excellent farcical comedy and\na jolly good panto. here is no denying that at times some of the humour\nfell \ufb02at as the cast\u2019s energy \ufb02agged,\nbut for actors who had been rehearsing for three days straight right before\nthe dress rehearsal their overall verve\nand the strength of the performance\nwas impressive. he pantomime element was not helped by the small and\nlacklustre audience of techies, directors and the lone reviewer, whose lack\nof cheering did little to fuel the actors\u2019\n\ufb01re. An enthusiastic audience are key\nto a successful performance (take this\nas a hint, readers!)\nhe dialogue and action are clich\u00e9d\nand \ufb01lled with sci-\ufb01 and pop culture\nreferences to the point of sheer ridicu-lousness, but Andromedan Nights\nmercifully subverts this by continually\nbreaking the fourth wall and recognizing itself for what it is: a farcical sci\ufb01 pantomime with some hilariously\ncheesy writing.\nAlong with some seasoned veterans,\nAndromedan Nights marks the DramSoc debut of several actors. he show\nis stolen by one such fresh face, Jack\nWilliams, who assumes the role of\nMince the Merciless, the play\u2019s (pretty\nmuch useless) antagonist. Williams\u2019s\nmaniacal energy and evil laughter \ufb01t\nthe incompetent supervillain to a tee,\nacting as the perfect comic foil to his\ntwo far more competent and grounded henchmen, imaginatively named\nMinion and Goon (Frank Machin and\nKristen Farebrother respectively).\nhose with absolutely no interest in\nsci-\ufb01 may want to give Andromedan\nNights a miss, as a large proportion\nof its humour derives from the more\nserious works of \ufb01ction it parodies.\nHowever, even those with a cursory\nknowledge of Star Wars/Hitch Hiker\u2019s\nGuide to the Galaxy/Lord of the Rings/\netc. will enjoy this highly entertaining\nperformance by some of DramSoc\u2019s\n\ufb01nest.\nDramsoc\u2019s Andromedan Nights\nis running on Friday March 1 and\nSaturday March 2. Student tickets\nare \u00a36 on the door, or \u00a35 online at\ndramsoc.org/tickets.\nLaurence Pope Writer\nIt\u2019s not always better to shoot first\n\u00a9 Ben Fry\n\n"

    "content": "La Playstation formidable?\nRoss Webster pondersthealphaofthenext-genpack\nnd here, in the wilderness of the internet,\nwe can see grainy footage of the species, that\nmany of us expect will\nbeckon in a new age of couch-based\ngaming.\nhis beast has been in hibernation\nfor a long time. Few have stumbled\nupon this elusive animal, and we had\nsketchy reports of its capabilities, but\nnothing was con\ufb01rmed until this new\nfootage was found. Now, hunters,\nthere is something new to mount on\nyour next-gen desk, beside your WiiU \u2013 the Playstation 4.\nhe really bad David Attenborough\nimpersonation aside, the biggest gaming announcement of last week is that\nof Sony\u2019s latest console \u2013 their entrant\nto the world\u2019s 8th generation console\nchampionship.\nDespite the announcement, there\u2019s\nstill quite a lot we don\u2019t know about\nthe PS4 \u2013 but what we do know is in-teresting. here seems to be a move\naway from unique console-oriented\narchitecture (such as the Cell processors of the PS3) and a move towards\nmore PC-ish hardware, such as x86_64\ncores. he widely-touted reason for\nthis change is because the games are\ndeveloped on the PC anyway, and\nswapping between architectures is a\nwaste of time and money. Why not\njust build on a PC, for a slightly altered\nPC? Both CPU and GPU are AMDsupplied, and are backed up with 8GB\nof RAM \u2013 16 times as much as the\nPS3, and 8 times as much as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox360. As with the departing\ngeneration, we\u2019ve been told that there\u2019s\nsizeable internal storage in the PS4,\nwhich is good, as one of the latest news\nsnippets is that all games available on\nthe PS4 will be available as a direct\ndownload. Kinda Steamy-ish, I guess.\nImages and prototypes for the new\nDualShock controllers are out, and\nthey\u2019ve kept the style of the older\nDualShock controllers, added some\nrounded bits from the Xbox control-lers, and thrown on a capacitative\ntouch screen on the front, a la Wii-U\nand PS Vita (sort of). I really like where\nthis new controller is heading, with a\n3.5mm audio jack (something I severely hate companies for not already\ndoing), but also a mono-speaker on the\nback.\nWith regards to the button layout,\nit\u2019s the normal con\ufb01guration when it\ncomes to playing games, but the Start\nand Select buttons (of the 90s) have\ngone the way of the Dreamcast, and\nbeen replaced by a single 360-esque\n\u2018Options\u2019 button. Added to the con-troller, however is a new \u2018Share\u2019 but-ton, which ties in the some of the new\nonline features promised by Sony.\nYou\u2019ll now be able to watch your\nfriends playing on their console, online\nthrough a stream (kinda like a built-in\nTwitch service) and you\u2019ll be able to\nstream games directly \u2013 it looks like\nneither Sony nor nVidia got the OnLive memo. At least it saves on internal\nmemory.\nhere are a few things which are unclear (especially due to Sony\u2019s liberal\nbreaking of promises (see: \u2018Other OS\u2019\nof PS3)) such as the use of pre-owned\ngames. here\u2019s still quite a market out\nthere (especially if the games are still\n~\u00a340), as a lot of people like to sell on\ntheir completed games, when they\u2019ve\nmilked it for all the trophies you can\nget. Sony has continued to be a little\nvague, with cryptic messages along\nthe lines of \u2018We\u2019ll do what\u2019s best\u2019 (I\u2019m\nimagining a Fagin-like Sony repre-sentative, and a sly wink). Well, best\nfor whom? It\u2019ll all come down to the\nvast amounts of scaremongering, and\nlatest draconian DRM, so I can\u2019t see it\nworking out well for the second-hand\nmarket, I\u2019m afraid. I actually want to be\nwrong though.\nUnusually for a game-based device,\nthe PS4 is said to ship with the new\nPlaystation Eye (now with two cam-eras) and a variable-colour light-bar\non the top of the controller, for use as\na PS Move \u2013 style device. hey\u2019re not\nmaking you pay extra for these bits \u2013\nthey\u2019re included (well, they are making you pay extra, but hidden away in\nthe original price, rather than an extra\npurchase, a few months after release.)\nRelease games are a little hand-wavey at the moment. As with Nintendo always bringing a Super Mario\ntitle upon release, Sony\u2019s bringing out\na new Killzone for the PS4, but most\nimportantly \u2013 Watch Dogs!\nAs you might have noticed, I\u2019m quite\na PC-oriented guy (and also an equal-opportunities employer), but I feel\npumped by what\u2019s been happening\nwith the development of the PS4, and I\nlike the shape of things to come.\nA\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\nGot some great news on sale... stranger\nLooks like my wishes may have been answered. An image has made its way, supposedly out of a Gamestop back room, showing a promotional poster (just in case\nthere\u2019s another type of poster out there) of the next instalment in the Assassin\u2019s\nCreed series \u2013 Assassin\u2019s Creed IV: Black Flag. The poster depicts a character wearing a Connor-style assassin\u2019s outfit, on the deck of a ship, amongst a horde of grizzled pirates. Unsubstantiated word is that you play Connor\u2019s grandfather...\nThere\u2019s a couple of good and bad things here \u2013 firstly, as I mentioned a few\nmonths ago, Pirate Assassins are only a few more words away from being awesome \u2013 acceptable additions are ninja, mutant (probably not teenage, nor turtle),\nand robot. However, it\u2019s not been long since AC3 came out, so what seems to be\na look-alike game, being advertised less than 6 months since the last game seems\nkinda early to me. There\u2019s a good chance that the image is just a good fake, brought\non by someone mentioning a slideshow they saw being written on a plane. This is\na bunch of strangers on the internet by the way, so they could have been talking\nabout the dinosaur expansion for Battlefield 3, and there would be just as much\nevidence behind it.\nI\u2019m kinda split 50:50 on it \u2013 I think it could be a great game, but it\u2019s way too\nsoon. \u2013 Ross Webster\nMy money. All of it.\nTake.\nVS.\nAss(assins) on the horizon Passionate about games?\n(Heck, if you know the\ndifference between\nMario and Master Chief,\nyou\u2019re welcome here.)\nWe\u2019re always looking for more\nvoices and opinions in the Felix of-fice, so if you feel like flexing those\ncreative muscles, rather than those\nthumbs, then come and get RSI\nwith us instead?\nIf you want to moan about the\ncurrent state of affairs regarding\nMMOs, or if you\u2019re looking for a\nteam to start developing your ide-as, drop us a line at games.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\nWho would win? Find out in Marvel vs. Capcom vs. Old English men\nMaybe not the final thing,\nbut it sure does look nice.\nWhat you can\u2019t see is the Flood,\nwearing little pirate hats.\n38\n\n"

They meet and start to fall in love, although it\u2019s not too long before he discovers her\nsecret with regards to how she managed to find him in the first place.\nThe Puke-worthy Twist: They have a fight after he uncovers her sneaky, journalistic\nways, but before he can come back, apologise and make up, he dies in a sailing accident\nwhilst trying to heroically save someone. A story she\u2019s told by his elderly father. And with\nhim there\u2019s the final letter he wrote, confessing his love for her. Boo-hoo.\nA Walk to Remember - 2002\nThe Photogenic Couple: Shane West and Mandy Moore\nThe Plot: He is the bad boy who has to join the lame high-school drama club to avoid\nexpulsion. He meets a cute, well-behaved girl there and they start dating, with the moody\nangryyoungladshowingsignsofchanginghissinfulwayswithhischarmingnewgirlfriend,\nand he decides that school isn\u2019t so bad after all .\nThe Puke-worthy Twist: She has leukaemia and is close to dying. He fulfills her dying\nwishes, and in the end she does die of course, but not before spending the perfect summer\nhoneymoon with her new husband.

They\u2019re initially divided by wealth, social classes\nand many, many intercepted love letters, but love does conquer all.\nThe Puke-worthy Twist: It\u2019s narrated from the future, where the older version of the\nman is telling the story to his wife who has Hollywood-dementia (only becoming lucid,\nthen senile again at the most perfect opportunities for the corniest, cheesiest narrative\nimpact).

    "content": "World War Z\nMaximilian Eggl looks at an unusual depiction of the zombie story\nast year was the year of\nthe Vampire, and it seems\nset that 2013 will be the\nyear of the Zombie. Don\u2019t\nunderstand me wrong,\nZombies have always been present in\nmovies, TV shows, games and books.\nHowever only recently this genre has\nachieved mainstream success, probably through a larger amount of zombie\ngames than ever, the show he Walking Dead as well as a large amounts of\nmovies dealing with the topic.\nMax Brooks, son of the famous\ndirector Mel Brooks, has popularised this genre in literature, with his\nbooks the Zombie Survival Guide\n(2003), World War Z (2006) and he\nZombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks (2009). In fact, one of his books,\nWorld War Z, is being released as a\n\ufb01lm in June 2013 with Brad Pitt as the\nmain character. his should tell you\nhow \u201cmainstream\u201d they have become.\nWhile I had read his books soon after\ntheir release, my recent re-reading of\nthem as well as this now rising popularity of Z\u2019s, made me think about\nwriting a review for his second book,\nnamely World War Z.\nInspired by a similar book based\non World War II, as well as George\nA. Romero, the man nicknamed the\n\u201cGodfather of Zombies\u201d, it is styled\nas a set of personal recollections and\ninterviews which deal with a global\noutbreak of Zombies. Each person\u2019s\nstory describes their own \ufb01ght to sur-vive, and together they describe the\nwhole arc of the apocalypse. hese anecdotes range from the human level,\nwhere a single person \ufb01ghts to make\nit through, all the way to the top dealing with the governments\u2019 attempts at\nstemming the \ufb02ood.\nhe underlying emotional themes\n(e.g. fear, patriotism, greed etc.) that\nunderlie each recollection also lead\nto a well-rounded book. Not really\nbloody or gory at all, this book deals\nmore with economics, politics, and\nhuman feelings. he book looks at\nhow society deals with possible ex-tinction, which makes the book all the\nmore powerful and much less \u201ccheap\u201d\nto read.\nAt the same time Max Brooks uses\nWorld War Z to describe the survivalist attitude that is permeating culture\nat this time, as well as criticising the\nweakness exhibited by our political\nsystem. Basically, he says that democracy is great, but in time of crisis political willpower may be lacking, as is\nshown by the example of the world\ngovernments (excluding Israel) in the\nearly days of the war.\nAnother thing that struck me was\nthe attitude of one of the survivors,\na Palestinian youth, who in the book\ndoes not believe in Zombies, thinking\ninstead it is an Israeli trick to reclaim\nPalestine lands. You may be able to\nlaugh at this short-sightedness since\nyou are reading a book called World\nWar Z, where zombies are obviously\nnot a trick by any governmental in-stitution. However, if you were in the\nsame situation, with no prior knowl-edge, would you really believe in Zombies? I didn\u2019t think so.\nhis interesting format was a great\ncontrast to the usual zombie fare, as\ninstead of focusing on one group and\ntheir needs and stories it tries to describe the e\ufb00ect such an epidemic\nwould have on the world as a whole.\nhis international approach encouraged me to read more, as it shows\nmany di\ufb00erent aspects of the human\ncondition, as well as how di\ufb00erent\ncultures deal with the same threat.\nAlso, who doesn\u2019t like reading about a\nhuge battle between the United States\narmy and a horde of zombies that just\ndestroyed New York, with the whole\ntanks and missiles thing!\nOne thing that did annoy me about\nthe format, though, was that Brooks\nwrote some of the short stories so\nwell that I just wanted to know what\nhappened next. In fact some of the anecdotes were so gripping that I could\nhave read a book with those stories\nexpanded to novel length. hus, when\nthe end of that particular recollection\ncame, I was slightly frustrated. hat\nmade it slightly hard to have a continuous \ufb02ow throughout the book.\nMax Brooks creates a well-crafted\nbook that does rede\ufb01ne this genre in\ntimes of renewed interest. With an\nenthralling array of stories, it is well\nworth the read. If you are a fan of the\nzombie genre, get to it! If you are not,\nand are just curious, get to it! Trust\nme, its worth your time.\nL\nI had heard a lot of good things about\nRichard Morgan, but a glance through\nthe blurbs of his novels didn\u2019t turn\nup anything that I thought I would\nparticularly enjoy. However, upon\nreading that Altered Carbon, his \ufb01rst\nbook, had been voted as the \ufb01fth best\nSF novel of the twenty \ufb01rst century by\nthe readers of Locus magazine, I decided that I just had to check it out.\nAltered Carbon is set in the not too\ndistant future where mankind have\ndiscovered a way to store human consciousness electronically, e\ufb00ectively\nguaranteeing immortality; when\nsomeone dies they can just be downloaded into a new body. he novel\nfollows Takeshi Kovacs, a former UN\nspecial forces soldier turned criminal\nand part time private investigator. He\nis bailed from electronic storage \u2013 the\nfuturistic equivalent of prison \u2013 by\nrich industrialist Laurens Bancroft to\ninvestigate who killed his last body.\nhe book is essentially a hardboiled\ndetective story in a science \ufb01ction\nsetting. Indeed, most of the characters are instantly recognisable genre\nclich\u00e9s \u2013 the cigarette smoking cynical detective, the femme fatale, the\ncorrupt power \ufb01gures. Few of these\nare likeable \u2013 Kovacs himself coming o\ufb00 as particularly brutal. Morgan\nhimself has said that the ultravio-lence directed by Kovacs against his\nenemies was meant to act as escapist\nrelease, both for himself and the read-ership, but it just makes Kovacs seem\nlittle better than his opponents. he\nscience \ufb01ctional elements add very\nlittle either. he cyberpunk themes\nexplored are nothing new and, for\nsomeone well versed in the genre,\nsimply seem very tired.\nDespite all of this, however, the\nbook somehow comes together to\nwork remarkably well. A combination of very good writing and a well\nthought out plot mean that you can\nalmost forget all of the previously\nmentioned problems. he action is\nfast paced and it is certainly very easy\nto become engrossed.\nI expect that how much you enjoy\nAltered Carbon will depend strongly\non what you\u2019re looking for \u2013 if you like\nwell-written, clever detective stories\nyou\u2019ll probably love it, if you\u2019re looking for something fresh and innovative you\u2019ll probably be disappointed.\nRichard Morgan\u2019s Altered Carbon\nMaciej Matuszewski Books Editor\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n30\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n32\nhen I \ufb01rst considered writing an\narticle on Boiler\nRoom, I thought\nit would be re-dundant. I always thought that it\u2019s just\none of those things that everyone who\nwould be interested knows about, but\nwhen I started chatting to people about\nit I realised this is not really the case.\nConsidering how electronic Imperial\u2019s\ntastes seem to be, as well as our churning out a pretty incredible number of\nDJs and producers, I felt this needed\nremedying.\nSo, the basics: Boiler Room is essentially a promoter who gets incredible\nline-ups of electronic musicians, shoves\nthem in a tiny room with a number of\nthe city\u2019s biggest hipsters and broadcasts a TV stream live over the internet.\nhat said, they\u2019re not always electronic\npeople; just last Friday they threw an\nincredible event with BEAK> (live),\nAnika (DJ set) and Jaakko (live) and on\nWednesday had the whole Boy Better\nKnow crew live in the place.\nhe whole thing is sponsored by the\ngreat folks over at Red Stripe \u2013 yet another perk, free beer \u2013 and for a good\nAMS album of the week\nThe release of Wonderful, Glorious, the 10th\nalbum from long-tenured indie rock band Eels\npresents a worrying fact about music: some-times, artists are overshadowed by their own\nsuccess.\nAlmost wholly the project of frontman Mark\nOliver Everett, Eels\u2019 music has been intensely\npersonal: their debut Beautiful Freak presented twisted love songs and scathing wit under\ndeceptively poppy beats. After the death of\nhis father (physicist Hugh Everett III, famous\nfor inventing the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics), mother and sister in the short space of a few years, Eels\u2019 1998 sophomore album\nElectro-Shock Blues is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece exploring suicide and\nbereavement.\nFrom these great heights, Eels\u2019 have fallen far. The greatest art is born out of\nsuffering, and Wonderful, Glorious screams complacency. There are still some\nemotions explored here, still some witty hooks, but the highs and lows of Eels\u2019\nearlier work is nowhere near matched. This isn\u2019t an album about death, break-ups, or even love: more than anything else, it sounds like an album about the\nmundane life of an aging, successful rock musician.\nMusically too, there is a lot to be desired. Instead of almost-twee hooks and\nsparse piano sounds juxtaposed against sorrowful lyrics, this album presents\nonly bland, middle-of-the-road indie rock. This isn\u2019t the tired, inevitably-awful\nalbum of an old band reforming way past their peak: clearly, Mark still has talent left in him. Although he may never produce another Electro-Shock Blues,\nthere may be some good albums yet to come from Eels, but only if he progresses again as a musician. Either that, or if all the rest of his family die.\nBoilerRoombikesandb2bs\nRoss Gray getsatasteoftheRedStripeMakeSessionseries\nfew events now they\u2019ve paired up o\ufb03cially with Boiler Room to present Red\nStripe Make Sessions. I was \ufb01rst introduced to this concept at the NTS one\nback in November, where 11 painfully\nobscure artists were crammed into a 4\nhour slot and their sets recorded live\nonto reel-to-reel tape. he product of\nthe evening was a sweet compilation\nvinyl; particular highlights include the\nincredibly bass-heavy Insomniax\u2019s\n\u2018Speakers Blow\u2019 and Graham Dunning\u2019s loop-manipulating experimen-talism.\nhe real spark for this piece was Red\nStripe Make Session 007 on Monday,\nwhich Red Stripe kindly let us tag along\nto. he musical line-up was simple but\nheavy: xxxy b2b Steve Braiden and\nMidland b2b Paul Woolford. In a\nslightly surreal centre stage, 14 Bike Co\nwere brought into the building to hand\nmake some damn \ufb01ne bespoke bikes\nwith the DJs names painted onto the\nframes.\nIt must be said that as much as I love\nit, Boiler Room does have a bit of a\nreputation (especially in London) for\nnot getting crazy at all \u2013 have a look\nthrough the Facebook comments on\nEels: Wonderful,Glorious\nW\nKeir Little\nJohnny Marr scores above par\nAt 49 years of age, it seems slightly\nodd that it took Johnny Marr this\nlong to put out a solo album. Renowned for being the guitarist of the\nin\ufb02uential indie pop band he Smiths\nin the 80\u2019s, Marr has been busy since\nthen playing in many bands such as\nModest Mouse, accompanied by he\nHealers and he Cribs. So, it\u2019s fair to\nsay that he\u2019s been around the block a\nfew times, mostly in groups without\ntaking the role of the frontman. Well,\nyou can argue that Johnny Marr and\nthe Healers was a bit like Marr\u2019s own\nband but I reckon he Messenger has\na lot more guts than Boomslang, the\nHealer\u2019s only album to date.\nhe album has all the markings\nof Marr\u2019s trademark guitar ri\ufb00s and\nmanages to sound like a new age\n80\u2019s record without being tacky. he\njangly ri\ufb00s in the opening track \u2018he\nRight hing Right\u2019 are quite reminiscent of the upbeat guitar playing\non many Smiths tracks. You would\nhardly think this is a musician that\u2019s\nbeen around for a while and despite\nall the nostalgia, the record manages\nto sound vibrant and fresh. he title\ntrack and \u2018he Crack Up\u2019 are \ufb01t to be\nplayed in any trendy bar where the DJ/\nBar Sta\ufb00 has some good taste in music and don\u2019t listen to Gangnam Style\nover and over again. \u2018Upstarts\u2019 is the\nsecond single to be released o\ufb00 the album and Marr\u2019s guitar here is strongly\nbacked by his strong vocals. All in all,\nit\u2019s a solid debut e\ufb00ort from one of the\nbest guitarist of all time.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the album\nhas a nostalgic feel for any Smiths\nfan because while you recognise that\nfamiliar guitar-playing by Marr, the\nPlabon Saha Writer\nlyrics remind you just how good the\nMorrissey-Marr pairing really was. I\nhave followed Morrissey\u2019s solo work\nquite closely as well and the same can\nbe noticed in his stu\ufb00 as well, great\nlyrics that are just begging for Marr\nto lay the beats down. Some will say\nthat he Smiths were good for their\nera and we shouldn\u2019t temper with\nit. Knowing very well that they will\n(probably) never re-unite, I guess all I\ncan do is listen to he Messenger and\nwonder what it could have been.\nalmost any of their\nphotos and you\u2019ll\nsee what I mean. I\nwas hoping that having purely b2b sets\nwould bring the energy up, and I\u2019m not\nsure whether it was\nthat or the sheer size\nof the venue relative\nto normal but it cer-tainlygotprettymen-tal. he end of Midland and Woolford\u2019s\nset in particular was\nnot only one of the\nmost impressive\npieces of track selection I\u2019ve seen but\nalso sent the crowd\nabsolutely wild.\nDe\ufb01nitely watch it if\nBoiler Room archive\nit, and watch out for\nIC Radio\u2019s head of\nprogramming with\nhis hipster glasses at\nthe front.\nwww.boilerroom.tv\n\n"

How did\nImperial College RAG make the turnaround from an almost defunct society to one that is so prosperous?\nWhen I took the position of RAG\nChair in the summer elections of\nlast year I was making a bold move.\nWhilst there had been a strong tradition of RAG at Imperial for many dec-ades, enthusiasm had waned over the\nyears and it was failing terribly when\nit came to engaging students. It might\nhave seemed as if Imperial students\ndidn\u2019t care about charity but I was\nsure that this wasn\u2019t the case and set\nabout working out why it wasn\u2019t work-ing.\nhe committee of last year consisted of around 3 active members,\ntoo few to get anything done by anyone\u2019s stretch of imagination. So I rang\neveryone I knew over the summer\nand progressively formed a team now\nconsisting of 15 central members and,\nthanks to the hard work of our Halls\nO\ufb03cer Joe Gibbs, 34 RAG Hall Reps\nwho represent RAG within the undergraduate halls.\nWe decided the RAG logo and\nbranding were outdated so we\nscrapped them. Working with the Union we developed the new splat logo\nand slapped it on a load of t-shirts\nand stickers, ready to take over Imperial. Freshers\u2019 Fair\nwas the chance to\nmake our mark so\nwe took it by storm.\nWe danced by our\nDJ booth, taking it\nin turns to get covered in whipped\ncream, and engaged\nanyone who happened to walk past.\nWe generated over\n1000 sign-ups for\nour mailing list \u2013\na RAG-record for\nsure.\nWhat followed was\na series of incredibly\nsuccessful events with\nmaximum participation (visit\nunion.ic.ac.uk/rag for full details).\nA\nAs the committee and volunteers get back into the swing of work,\nRAG Chair David Goldsmith reflects on the week\nOur Poppy Appeal collect generated\n96 volunteers, raising over \u00a310,000\nfor the Royal British Legion. Our Rubik\u2019s cube ball packed out Metric. We\nheld a simple Bake Sale and managed\nto raise a whopping \u00a31723! So as you\ncan see Imperial is most de\ufb01nitely not\nshort of those intent on raising for\ncharity.\nRecognition then came from the\noutside world in the form of a prize\nfor the most innovative fundraising idea for our 24-hour row on the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn, getting our committee\ninvited to the BBC Children in Need\nLive Show. We were succeeding, and\nwhen Christmas came we knew we\nhad generated the power to grab the\nattention of the whole university with\nour RAG week. So we met with the\nRector and other members of College\nstaff and brought something to Imperial that had never been seen before\u2026\na 164 foot high Bungee Jump. Tickets\nsold out straightaway, sponsorship\nwas raised in the thousands and the\nspectacle dazzled all.\nIf you had asked many Imperial students at the beginning of the year what\nRAG was you might have received an\nunsure response: \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 or \u2018Is\nit that thing medics do?\u2019 (For clari\ufb01cation IC RAG is a separate entity to\nICSM RAG!). Now you would be very\nhard pressed to \ufb01nd someone who\nhasn\u2019t felt our impact.\nhrough the work of the RAG com-mittee, in hand with the students of\nImperial, at least \u00a346,000 more has\nbeen raised for our charities this year\nthat would not have been raised oth-erwise. But this success is compound-ed. We have generated the awareness\nand enthusiasm that will ensure a tradition of RAG that will last for many\nyears to come.\nTo continue we need more\ntalented and driven people\nto get involved. If you want to\nhelp ensure RAG\u2019s success in\ncoming years and to participate in next year\u2019s committee\ne-mail me at ragchair@ic.ac.\nuk. he new committee shall\nbe formed in the third term of\nthis year.\nI\u2019d like to make a special\nmention to the following\npeople:\n\u2022 Callum Kirk (Treasurer)\nwhose superhuman e\ufb03ciency and determination has\nhelped ensure RAG\u2019s success.\n\u2022 Christopher Winchurch\n(Vice-chair and Publicity Of\ufb01cer) who spent days on end\ndesigning the RAG guides\nand posters for RAG week.\n\u2022 Joseph Gibbs (Hall Reps O\ufb03cer)\nwho spread the word of RAG to the\nhalls.\nTo continue\nwe need\nmore talented\nand driven\npeople to get\ninvolved\nRAG Chair\nAll photos by Benjamin Lester\n\n"

So I see no good reason to why another Soc Off should not be run \u2013 it\u2019s called Soc\nOff 2.0. It\u2019s pretty much the same set-up as last time i.e. dress as your subject, \u00a31 to get in, all the entry fees go to\nthe 3 Dep Socs who get the highest proportion of their students to attend and students studying different subjects\ncompete on in\ufb02atables e.g. Sumo Suit Wrestling Tournament and Gladiator Duel.\nThrough the success of a second event I plan to leave next year\u2019s Sabbs with a good model to run a Mums and\nDads night on the second week of the Autumn term, so if Soc Off 2.0 is a success last like the last one, we will help\nimprove the Union\u2019s Mums and Dads scheme for 2013.\nHopefully, you really want to attend now, so come along at 20:00, Wednesday 7 March to Metric and show that your\nsubject is the best and help improve Imperial\u2019s \u201cgood community atmosphere\u201d\n.\nDoug Hunt\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (EDUCATION)\ndpeducation@imperial.ac.uk\nSoc Off 2.0 - show your support for your Dep Soc!\nSupport our campaign\nWe need you to send us your #AgainstActon thoughts and experiences to\nhelp us campaign against College\u2019s plan to open a 700 bed halls of residence\nover 30 minutes away in North Acton.\nWe are very concerned about what the effect will be, of living so far away\nfrom campus, on students\u2019 welfare.

Bins and ashtrays\nare mysteriously disappearing from places like\nthe RSM entrance and my inbox is \ufb01lling up with passive-aggressive emails.\nInterfering busy-bodies have made it\ntheir mission to enforce the ridiculous\n\u2018smoke-free\u2019 zones around campus and\nteenagers with the glazed look of Jehovah\u2019s witnesses, wearing NHS tabards,\nroam the streets ambushing perfectly\ninnocent pedestrians. All right and\ngood? No it is bloody not. I am a\nproud smoker and I am starting to\nget seriously peeved.\nFor me personally smoking is not\na tragic addiction. I am not crying out\nfor an intervention, desperate for a\npasser-bytosavemefromacrippling\nvice. I smoke because I genuinely enjoy it and my choice is a rational one.\nI \ufb01nd the process of rolling a cigarette\nand contemplatively breathing in\nthe smoke almost meditative. I\nlove the social aspect of hunkering down in a doorway, sheltering\nfrom the rain and putting the world\nto rights with a friend. I love the gentle\n\ufb02irting over zippo \ufb02ame outside a club.\nI love watching smoke lazily climb into\na dusky sky over a glass of red wine. I\nlove the post-coital surge of nicotine\nout of a bedroom window as my girlfriend dozes in bed and most of all I\nlive for those early morning moments,\nwalking alone, watching the light of the\nmoon bounce of the millpond surface\nof the hames.\nHere is the big scoop. I am not going to stop just because a puckered\nlipped old granny fakes a cough. I am\na stubborn mule and the intrusion of\nanti-smoking crusaders is only going to\nmake me more so. I will give up when I\nam good an ready and not a single minute before.\nC\nThe College\u2019s current tirade against smokers is stupid and unfair \u2013\nsmokers should be proud of what they do, says Meredith Thomas\nSmokersasagrouphavebeenmarked\nout as a scourge on society and a free\ufb01re zone for snide remarks, unwanted\ncriticism and outright bullying. When\nthe smoking ban was suggested a lot of\npeople saw the sense in the policy and\ngracefully rolled over. However, this\nseems to have set a precedent for a rolling process of increasing stringent rules\nabout when and where a smoker can indulge in an activity, which is essentially\nan individual\u2019s choice. Well, I no longer\nfeel obliged to subscribe to the\nlip- service. he\nfeeling\nof being\ns t r a i g h t-jacketed into\na weird self-loathing has gone\non long enough and\nit\u2019s time smokers started\nstanding up for themselves\nHere is a common myth: by\nsmoking I am costing the taxpayer through my future health\ncosts. his is wrong. In 2009, researchers from Oxford University estimated the annual cost of smoking to\nthe NHS at \u00a35bn. hat sounds like a lot,\nright? But it pales in comparison to the\n\u00a39.5bn that excise duty on cigarettes\ncontributed to the treasury in the same\nyear. On top of this, the sale of tobacco\ncontributes billions more through VAT\nand corporation tax. So, I pay for my\nhabit, a few times over in fact.\nHere is another: passive smoking\nkills. Yes, it does a\ufb00ect long term health\noutcomes but you need a lot of expo-sure. he amount of smoke breathed in\nby waitresses and barmen in con\ufb01ned\nenvironments, over the course of their\ncareer has been shown to have a signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ect. However this argument\ndoes not extend to outdoor locations,\nno matter what your proximity to a\nbuilding entrance. hat is just common\nsense, I\u2019m afraid.\nFinally: smoking kills. No one is denying that smoking dramatically a\ufb00ects\nyour chances of acquiring conditions\nlike lung cancer and vascular stenosis.\nHowever some slightly awkward research from the University of Toronto\nshows reductions in life expectancy\nare almost totally negated if you\nquit before the age of 40. It\nturns out that smoking is\nbad for you in a much\nmore speci\ufb01c way than\npeople would have\nus believe. If you\nrestrain from\ns m o k i n g\na r o u n d\nkids or\nf o r\na n\nextremely\nlong period\nof your life it is\nsimply is not that\nbad. Shock horror, the\nrigorous and reliable science of epidemiology has led\nus astray again.\nSo what are we left with as a justi\ufb01cation for hounding smokers further and\nfurther into the wind and rain? What\nreasons do we quote for ostracising this\nparticular portion of society? Wait for\nit\u2026 Some people do not like the smell?\nWell screw them, quite frankly. I \ufb01nd\nlots of things annoying - bad breath,\nbad fashion sense, bad music - but I\nam not deluded enough to believe for\na minute that my opinions give me the\nright to tell other people how to live\ntheir lives. If you do not want to smell\nthe smoke all you have to do is get out\nof my face.\nhere is one \ufb01nal objection from a\nrecent email: \u201c[Smokers do] not present\nour university in the best light for visitors.\u201d his seems to be suggesting that\nCollege want to airbrush out around a\nthird of the undergraduate community\nfor aesthetic reasons, which is frankly\nbizarre and barely merits a rebuttal.\nIf we are happy with this argument I\nwould suggest we \ufb01rst focus our attention on tackling the problem of Ugg\nboots on campus.\nHaving found very little to support\nthe current purge, here are my sug-gestions. If you are the type of person\nwho rolls your eyes and tuts every time\nyou choose to brush the edge of some\ntransient pu\ufb00 of smoke, my advice is\nto suck it up, get over yourself, show\na bit of empathy and \ufb01nd something\nmore important to worry about. To my\nbrothers and sisters who enjoy the occasional pu\ufb00 on a cheroot, cigarillo or\nhumble rollie, show a bit of pride. here\nis no need to pretend to be quitting\nwhen you clearly do not want to. Let\u2019s\nkeep doing our thing and when the\nanti-smoking Stasi kick up a fuss, smile,\nedge away and wait for them to turn the\ncorner before ignoring them.\nBetter still, how about we all try to\nshow a bit of understanding for other\npeople\u2019s life choices. Now I have \ufb01nished writing this I am going to have a\nfag and woe betide anyone who tries to\nget in my way.\n\u201d\nI smoke\nbecause I\ngenuinely\nenjoy it and\nmy choice is a\nrational one\nLetters\nDear Sir,\nSave me.\nI write concerning an issue crucial\nfor the maintenance of my sanity. I\n\ufb01nd myself, on a daily basis, sorely\nand \ufb02irtatiously tempted, only to have\nthe roaring \ufb02ame of my desire erupt\ninto an unbridled explosion of anger,\nas I see my future dreams quashed by\nthe iron hammer of ineptitude. I can\nonly thank reality that I\u2019m a tough guy\nand, as such, well- practiced in calmly\nwalking away from such explosions.\nHowever, with this daily cycle of rejec-tion, I don\u2019t hold out much hope for\nmy sanity. It is a dwindling resource,\nand its scarcity alarms me.

Pronounced \u201cchee\u201d, Qi is a wireless inductive power standard that is\nincreasingly being adopted by handset\nmanufacturers such as Nokia and LG\nfor inclusion into their handsets. For\nphones that do not support the wireless\ncharging standards, there are cases designed to envelope the devices and provide wireless charging capabilities. But\nis wireless charging even necessary, or\nis it just a solution to no one\u2019s problem?\nWireless charging\nworks in a similar way\nto induction cooking. A\nchanging magnetic \ufb01eld\ninduced by the charging\nmat causes a potential\ndi\ufb00erence, or a voltage\ndi\ufb00erence, across a conductor inside the phone.\nBy Faraday\u2019s laws, this\ncauses a current to \ufb02ow\ninside the conductor, and\nwe\u2019ve got a steady power\nsource for the phone. So,\nin order to take advantage of this technology,\nyou would need to both\nhave a phone that supports wireless charging,\nand a wireless charging\ndevice.\nhe wireless charging mats are not cheap.\nI bought a Maxwell Air\nVoltage Wireless Charger o\ufb00 Amazon for \u00a343,\nbut the price has now\ngone up to almost \u00a350\nat the time of writing.\nGoogle o\ufb00ers a trendy\n\u201ccharging orb\u201d for its\nNexus 4 device, retailing for US$59.99 (\u00a340)\nand not yet on sale in the\nUK. If the various manufacturers wish to see\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n40\nwireless charging take o\ufb00, they are not\ndoing themselves a favour by charging\nsuch a high price for the charging mat.\nhe upside to this is that these charging mats should work with future\ndevices, if the Qi standards remains\ndominant. (Caution: if you are looking to buy a wireless charging mat,\navoid the ones sold by \u201cPowermat\u201d \u2013\nthey do not conform to any standards,\nand you will need a separate case for\nall of your devices.) But how do these\nwireless charging gizmos perform?\nI do not speak authoritatively on\nthis matter, but from my experience\nwith wireless charging on my Nexus\n4, I would say that the wireless charging has good performance. In fact, I\nmight say that it performed better\nthan I expected. Charging is almost as\nquick as using an AC adapter. It is really convenient to just place the phone\non the mat and watch it start charging\nautomatically, without my needing to\nplug in anything. he downside to this\nis that the phone tends to get a little\nwarm when charging. I notice that if I\nuse the phone while it\u2019s charging, the\ntemperature can get up to 42 degrees,\nat which point the phone would decide to stop charging (for safety I pre-sume). his leads to the phone and the\ncharging mat getting into what I call\nthe \u201cspasm\u201d mode where the charging indicator would toggle on and\nCharging your Phone... Wirelessly\nWill the lack of Wires (or lack thereof) ever conspire to be desired?\nThe News Bubble\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date with the\nnewest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.\nNokia Release Phones\nAt the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Nokia has just released 4 new\nphones, all aimed at the lower end. The two new WIndows 8 smartphones\ncalled the 720 and the 520, retail between \u00a3220 and \u00a3120 respectively. Both\nof these are quite well euipped compared to their cheap price. On the other\nhand Nokia also released two new feature phones, the 301 and the 150. The\n301 is your bog standard feature phone and will be available for about 50\nquid. However the 150 has created quite a buzz on the internet, as not only\nis it priced at the very lucrative price of \u00a313, but also apparently has a battery that lasts for an entire month without recharging. Nokia really wants to\nregain that top mobile vendor spot, and this strategy seems like it may prove\nvery succesful.\nChromebook Pixel\nGoogle has also released a new product, the Pixel. An apparently high-end\nlaptop, this device is aimed at power users with a bit more cash in their pock-ets. Coming with the Chrome OS, a purely browser based operating system\nand with a pixel density of 239 ppi (which by the way makes it the highest\nresolution laptop currently on the market) it looks like quite an interesting\nlaptop. However, without an internet connection, it just becomes a $1,499\npaper weight.\nGalaxy Note 8.0\nAll good things come in sets of three, and fittingly Samsung also has released a\nnew product. The Galaxy Note 8.0 used with a smart stylus, which allows you\nto use the buttons on the tablet without actually pushing them, is going into\ndirect competition with Apple\u2019s new iPad Mini. With a higher screen resolution and generally good reviews, when this comes out later this year, it may\nprove to be a good adversary.\niPhone Ahead of S3\nRecently Apple has been hammered, its stock has lost a third of its value from\nits $700 high, and everyone has been predicting that the days of the Cupertino Company are numbered. However recent data related to mobile handset sales puts the Samsung Galaxy SIII, Android\u2019s most popular phone, only\nthird in the list. Number one spot is taken by the iPhone 5, Apple\u2019s flagship.\nThe surprising thing is that the second spot is taken by the iPhone 4S. Apple\u2019s\nphone which is more than a year old, and is quite outdated compared to other\nhandsets out there is still outselling everything except for its bigger brother.\nSeeing that kind of data really makes me wonder why Apple is being ripped\napart by all the critics and investors.\nThe wireless charging\nmats are not\ncheap\nTech editor\nYong Wen Chua Tech Writer\no\ufb00 every few seconds.\nI suppose with more\niteration, the hardware\nwould be more e\ufb03cient,\nand the heat produced\nthrough the charging\nshould reduce. But is\nthis even necessary?\nAdvocates would say\nthat wireless charging\nis very convenient, and\nhelps in bringing about\na wire-free environ-ment. his is absolutely\ntrue, as I have noted\nin the previous para-graph. However, pardon\nmy cynicism, this also\nsounds patently like a\n\ufb01rst world problem.\nhere is also a wire that\ngoes from the AC wall\nsocket to the charging\nmat, something that\nyou can\u2019t really be rid of.\nYou are just trading one\ncable for another. here\nare arguments saying\nthat the mechanical act\nof plugging in and taking out the charging cable can lead to mechanical failure on the phone,\nalthough I have yet to\nsee it really happen to me.\nSceptics would call wireless\ncharging a fad. I would call it\nsomething cool. While I can see\nthe added convenience of wireless charging, the whole solution\ndoesn\u2019t really bring much more to\nthe table. What we need are batteries that last longer, and components that use less power. Wireless\ncharging does not even address any\nof these problems. When you add\nin the cost of buying one of those\ncharging mats, there is simply no\nadded bene\ufb01t. So until these charging mats become more a\ufb00ordable,\nthere is simply no point in using\nwireless charging.\n\u201d\n\u201c\nIt is really\nconvenient to\njust place the\nphone on the\nmat\n\n"

In an article recently published\nby he Guardian newspaper it was\nspeculated that \u201cerrors were caused\nby ink-stained photocopied sheets\nthat could not be read by the automated marking system\u201d. It has been\ncon\ufb01rmed that up to twelve hundred\nscripts will undergo revision by hand.\nA mounting air of cynicism has been\ncatalysed by these revelations, being\nparticularly vocalised on Twitter.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n28\nOlga Zavershinskaya\nJames Capper\nRaqib Shaw\nMinjeong An\nChristiane Shillito\nHelen Pynor\nHelen Pynor is a London based artist born in Australia. Her work has gained an increasing following in recent years leading to a title exhibit in the Superhuman show\nat the Wellcome Collection last summer. However we think she still qualifies as under the radar. This recognition probably stems for her choice of subject matter. Her\nbreathtakinglybeautifulprintsspeaktothevieweraboutsomethingverypersonal,our\nrelationship with our bodies. By juxtaposing clothing, text and organic matter in the\nstrange aquatic settings she creates, she invites the viewers to discuss the fragility of\nour relationship with the corporeal. Pynor is also a keen proponent of the art-science\nphenomenon sweeping London currently, which suggests she might be one to watch\nwithaneyetothefuture.\nJames Capper makes art for our time. The times that have\nbeen taken over by machines. If machines do not quite rule\nthe world yet, they certainly rule in Capper\u2019s head. His\nsculptures are like dreamed machines in a dream where the\naesthetics of machines have been streamlined to useless\nbeauty. If you have ever climbed up to the top of an abandoned crane at an abandoned dockyard, you might understand the beauty of machines (also if you are an engineer)\nand if so, Cappers awe-inspiring installations are something\nyou should take a look at. He is a recognised figure on the\nLondon art scene but his work is incredibly appealing and\nshould achieve wider renown in the coming years.\nLike many engineers, I have always had a slightly pathological adoration for technical drawings and diagrams. This is\nprobably why the aesthetic and concept of Korean artist,\nMinjeong An\u2019s self portraits, appeal to me. By schematically\nexploring connections between the physiology of her body\nand her second internal landscape of thought and emotion\nshe bridges a gap that has troubled thinkers for millennia.\nHer art brilliantly marries modern philosophical and scientific beliefs about mind and body in an original and very personal way. The designs are also very attractive and colourful\npieces worthy of a few minutes consideration each.\nOne gets the impression that British artist Cristiane Shillito (a.ka Ulorin Vex)\nmight be considered a little alternative. Currently based in Los Angeles she appears to split her time between modelling and illustration. Unquestionably embedded in the fetish scene her delicate pen and ink illustrations are mesmeriz-ingly beautiful. Often featuring erotic, fetish, sci-fi and mystical visual imagery\nwith bold colours, her art work has been on my personal wishlist for many years.\nI find myself very attracted to the visual complexity and complex layers of symbolism as well as the strong character of her portraits. Despite the fairly graphic\nimagery there is an almost naive innocence that runs through both the artwork\nand the execution that evokes a joyful impression of sexuality.\nRaqib Shaw has already entered the art world with explosive\nforce but he has not yet been taken up by the public conscious-ness. For a society who is constantly moaning the loss of the\nartist\u2019s craft, Shaw is the perfect antidote. Crazy and wild magical creatures, bejewelled and tied down, almost human are the\nfocus of his work. He comes from Kashmir and the indian influ-ence, that of carpet weavers, spice sellers and purple and yellow crocus flowers, is evident in his work. Don\u2019t think however,\nthat India is all you\u2019ll get from Raqib Shaw. His pieces are often\npainful and raw images of a different world, one full of colour\nand almost overflowing with richness, but also one thar can very\neasily translate to our own experience.\nOlga Zavershinskaya is a Russian photographer born in the\nformer USSR. A latecomer to photography she now resides in\nCzech Republic teaching and working. She says of her fine art\nphotography that \u201cit tackles methods of realization, emotional\nand aesthetic principles\u201d. Her images blend concept and method\nto create starkly beautiful geometric portraits. Olga combines\nlines, the human form and light in brain bending ways to convey\nnotions of style and perfection and sensuality. Her work, particularly her series Mind Games, has gained a considerable amount\nof online recognition but lacks the broader notoriety it deserves.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n"

Imperial College rents\nthe \ufb01rst three levels of Parsons House,\nlocated on the grounds of Charing\nCross Hospital, from housing company\nA2 Dominion and then rents out individual rooms to students for \u00a3121.82 a\nweek. All rooms are single occupancy\nwith a shared kitchen and bathrooms.\nAn anonymous source, however, told\nFelix, that they \u201cpay about \u00a3290.53 a\nmonth for a 5th \ufb02oor room renting\nfrom A2 Dominion directly\u201d\n. Assuming a 12 month and 52 week year and\nincluding a \u00a325 a month for internet ac-cess, which those renting from Imperial\nget free, this works out at \u00a372.81 a week.\nhis means that a student staying at\nParsons House for the standard 39 week\nImperial contract length will still pay\nmore \u2013 \u00a34750.98 \u2013than a student renting privately for the whole year \u2013 who\nwill pay \u00a33786.36.\nhese \ufb01gures have, however, been\nchallenged by Paul Noke, Head of College Residential Services, who told Felix\nthat the company who owns the building \u201ccurrently charges rents of \u00a3105.51\nper week for rooms elsewhere in the\nbuilding\u201d\n. However, Felix has obtained\ndocuments showing that the rooms do\nindeed cost around \u00a3290 per month, as\nstated above.\nNoke explained that the higher College rents resulted primarily from the\nCollege being \u201cobliged to pay an annual\nrent for the rooms (including water,\nelectricity, planned maintenance for the\nbuilding) even though the rooms cur-rentlyformpartoftheUGaccommoda-tion portfolio [and as such] are used to\naccommodate Imperial students on 39\nweek contracts\u201d\n. He further explained\nthat \u201c5 of the 48 rooms that form part of\n[the] contract are used to provide Wardening accommodation, [which] needs\nto be paid for\u201d; that, \u201c students get hall\nevents/parties [which are] organised\nby the Wardens and Hall Committee [and] are paid for by the amenities\nfund, which is charged for within the\nrent\u201d and that privately renting residents \u201care also responsible for some of\ntheir own minor repairs to their \ufb02ats,\nwhereas [Imperial] students would not\nbe expected to pay for this\u201d\n. He concluded that \u201cthe \u00a3121.82 per week rent\nthat we currently charge is correct once\nyou divide all of the costs over the 39\nweek licence period\u201d and was also careful to point out that private rooms \u201care\nrented on six month rolling tenancies,\nso a room only become available when\na tenancy is relinquished\u201d\n. his means\n\u201can undergraduate student may not be\nable to secure accommodation there for\nthe whole of the academic year\u201d unless\nrenting from Imperial.\nClaims of insu\ufb03cient warden sup-port, with the anonymous source telling\nFelix that \u201cthe wardens don\u2019t seem to\norganise many/any social events\u201d\n, were\nalso challenged by Dr Marko Krzanric,\nthe Head Warden of Parsons House. Dr\nKrzanric maintained that the Wardens\nand seniors have \u201cmanaged to organise\n60-ish events this academic year so far\u201d\n,\nincluding \u201cFreshers Fortnight events,\nChristmas party, weekly Sunday break-fasts, Poker nights, trips to the theatre and circus, cooking competitions,\nLondon tours, Holiday themed events\n(Pancake Day, Halloween, Burns Night)\nand even a Christmas meal and New\nYears party for students who could not\nbe home during holidays\u201d\n.

Instead, doodle all lecture long and then send us your drawings\ntoarts.felix@ic.ac.uk. ThisdoodlewasdonebyIoannaKalogeraki.\nFRIDAY 01 MARCH\n26\nIf you were to get a tattoo what would\nit be and why? hink about it for a mo-ment. Perhaps you already have one.\nDoes it represent anything important to\nyou or is it purely aesthetic?\nFor Danzig Daldaev, tattoos shaped his\nlife. He was born in Russia in 1925 and\ncondemned in 1948 by the KGB to work\nas a warden in Leningrad Prison \u2013 as a\n\u2018son of the enemy\u2019\n. He devoted his life to\nrecording tattoos of inmates and documenting their di\ufb00erent meanings. What\nwas, at \ufb01rst, a curiosity quickly developed into an obsession and over 50 years\nhe accumulated a catalogue of over 3000\nexamples.\nTattooing within prison was illegal and\nseverely punishable but on discovery of\nDaldaev\u2019s project, the KGB decided to\nsupport him in his work. His drawings\nprovided them with an invaluable criminal record of a prisoner\u2019s life history; eve-rythingfrompreviouscrimes,birthplace,\naspirations and even sexuality could be\nfound out from their tattoos.\nOne example is of a winged woman\ndancing on a hand. he text reads \u2018Oh,\n\ufb01ckle fortune, smile on me once more\u2019\n.\nIt describes the thief\u2019s desire to commit\na single large-scale theft, which would allow him to give up his life of crime.\nRunning in parallel with Daldaev, be-tween1989and1993,wasSergeiVasiliev,\nbrought in to formally photograph this\nunderground Russian criminal language.\nIn his intimate photographs we see his\nsubjects stripped bear, openly exposing\ntheir adorned bodies to the camera. We\nsee pride and honour in their faces but\nwe also sense an element of reserve and\nserenity. His subjects are both vulnerable and strong, which I found part of the\nsheer fascination that his photographs\nevoke.\nWalking around this exhibition I was\ndrawn to the symbolism of the tattoos\nand questioning what they meant and\nwhytheywerethere.hemysterybehind\nthe portraits was what initially fascinated\nme and translating the illustrations emphasised how much the tattoos acted as\na secret language in the Russian criminal\nunderworld.\nIf we look further into the picture of\nthe \u2018Man and the Cello\u2019 we see tattoos\nof the \u2018thieves\u2019 stars\u2019 which openly display resentment and bitterness towards\nauthority and can be read as \u2018I will not\nkneel before the police\u2019\n. Furthermore the\nmanaclesonhisanklessignifythathehas\nserved sentences of over \ufb01ve years. But\nLauren Ratcliffe Writer what I found most striking was the juxtaposition between the sense of vulnerability and gentleness in his expression\nand the tattoos of the daggers through\nhis neck, which symbolise that he had\ncommitted murder while imprisoned\nand is available to hire for further assas-sinations.\nWithin the criminal society tattoos\nwere used as a form of hierarchy, a man\nbare of tattoos would be of the lowest\nstatus whereas one adorned from head\nto toe would be almost untouchable. he\ntemptation to boost your status by getting unearned tattoos is therefore great.\nHowever, considered a serious insult, if\nfound to be displaying \u2018false\u2019 tattoos you\nwould be beaten, raped and have them\nforcibly removed.\nLater, in 2003, a graphic design company named FUEL brought both Daldaev\nand Vasiliey\u2019s work together and formed\na Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia, made of three volumes. It displays all\nthe drawings and photographs collected\nfrom the men\u2019s joint obsession.\nGo visit this exhibition for yourself.\nhe Saatchi Gallery is just a ten minute\nwalk away on Kings Road. Gaiety is the\nMost Outstanding Feature of the Soviet Union is on until May 5 and entry is\nfree of charge.\n\n"
