It is hoped that one third\nof this price will be refunded to\nmembers (fee 5/- per year, by the\nUnion, thus bringing the cost\ndown to 1/4 per game.\nIf you are interested, please\ncontact R.J. Kirlc. Physics 3, via\nthe Union or Physics racks.\nA WARNING\nTO THE OTHER CLUBS\nIf you have no receipt, then you can't claim\nyour money back. This was the lesson learned\nby some 30 people who paid shilling subscriptions\nlast year to the Ten-Pin Bowling Club. Their\ngrouse is that under the first committee they saw\nno goods for their money.\nThe club was only recognized by RC C in the\ncourse of the last session. Consequently it did\nnot qualify for a grant and its committee were\nnot answerable to higher authority. So members\njoined and paid their fees by \" gentlemanly agree-ment.\" The treasurer could not account for the\nmoney he took.\nLast term the club secretary called an annual\ngeneral meeting. None of the resting committee\nattended, so the RCC chairman took the chair. A completely new committee, the present one, was\nelected.\nTHE PINS DROP\nUnder new management the recreation at last\nbegan. No further subscriptions were taken, but\ngroups visited ten-pin bowls. As no proper\naccounts had been kept by the first committee, the\nnew one could take no action.\nThe Ten-Pin Bowling Club is now under the\nstringent ruling of RCC. With 60 members to\ndate, it now flourishes with regular bowling. Last\nWednesday it became affiliated to the British Ten\nPin Bowling Association.\ncus\non Tapsoc\nAs a result of a recent article in Sennet, a mysterious underground society has been formed\nwithin I.C. Under the unofficial title of the\nTelephone Tapping Society, at least twenty-seven\ngroups of burly telephone swindlers (each group\npreviously ignorant of the existence of the other\ntwenty-six) have banded together for the purpose\nof swopping dialling codes, high-collared raincoats,\npennies and other essential equipment.\nInformation concerning this society is difficult\nto obtain. But on questioning 120 of my closest\nfriends in an exclusive Felix survey I was shocked\nto find that 95 per cent of them knew about the\nillegal activities of the the other 5 per cent. What\ndecadence!\nApparently the society's main activity at present\nis writing replies to the several thousand enquiries\nfrom students at underprivileged colleges (Arts\nstudents find it particularly difficult to get jobs in\nGPO telephone exchanges). The compilation of a complete list of telephone codes of the world in\none volume is being considered. But it appears\nthat far more urgent is the need to equip all our\nSennet reporters with the telephone codes to their\nown hometowns. They're feeling pretty lonely at\nthe moment. . .\nM.

    "content": "2 FELIX FELIX has received a number\nof letters concerning the I.C. re-fec tories. Below are some points\nfrom them together wi!h Mr.\nMooney's explanations.\n1. The food served this year\nhas been definitely sub-standard\nand I am sure no outside caterer\nwould dare to serve anything like\nit for fear of his livelihood.\nNo outside caterer would take\non the job of serving some 2,400\nmeals in the space of under two\nhours and continue to maintain\nthe variety of eating places and\ndishes available.\n2-. Meals are often of low\nquality.\nThis is not true when one considers the low prices of the meals.\nPoor quality meat is returned to\nthe butcher, as happened with\nsome pork chops some ten days\nago. A visiting dietician commended Mr. Mooney on the\nvariety of the meals he served.\n3. Service is very sluggish . . .\nif you do not want chips and peas.\n\"Everything is sluggish at\ntimes.\" The time to complain is\nthere and then. The Spanish\nladies are most co-og erat ive if\nthey are treated with respect.\n4. The complaints book has\ndisappeared.\nIt is up to the Union Executive\nto provide a complaints book.\nThis has now reappeared.\n5. Prices are ridiculous (Slice\nof toast 5d....) This is not true-\u2014toast is 2d.A menu of breakfast prices is to\nappear in S. S. and the Union\nREFECTORIES\nCottage pie . . .2/7.\nThis was a slip which has been\ncorrected. Our prices compare\nfavourably with other London\ncolleges.\n6. The food (in S. S.) is cold.\nThis is due to ventilator y air\nfor the kitchen which is drawn\nfrom the LOWQT Refectory and\npasses over the food on the hot\nplate. Alterations will be made.\nto choose one dish this will obviously happen.\nMr. Mooney this term has\nserved an unprecedented number\nof meals.\nEvery evening (with two exceptions) there has been at least one\ndinner; teas for societies have\nnumbered two or three a day.\nWhen, a fortnight ago, there was\nsome muddle over the number of\nCOMPLAINTS OFFICERS\nBeit. . . Adrian Fletcher\n7. The Serve ; and Eating\nHouses are cold.\nNot Mr. Mooney's responsibility.8. Certain choices are off half-an-hour after opening.\nThis should not occur. But if\nfor some reason everyone decides\nSouthside . . . Pete Wal'on\ndiners at an R.C.S. Freshers'\ndinner, in half-an-hour he not\non jy provided an additional 50\ndinners but also moved the venue\nto accommodate the additional\nnumbers.\nMr. Mooney has probably the\nmost unenviable job in the col-leg e. He serves a great number\nof people all of whom get value\nfor money (if not, the profits\nwould be excessive \u2014 they are\nnot). If for some reason you\nhave a serious complaint, write it\nin the Complaints Book. If on\nreading the reply you are not\nsatisfied, see the Refectory Complaints Officer concerned. (See\nbelow.)\nCongratulations, Mr. Mooney\nDear Sir,\nIt is a rare occasion that I write\nto the press but, in a sense this is\na follow-up to a brief item in the\nlate news of your last issue.\nYou may or may not remember\nthat a letter was written to Mr.\nMooney concerning the dangerous condition of an artificial\ntomato employed in the Lower\nDining Hall in the Beit Building.\nConsiderable damage to personal\nclothing ensued. A prompt reply\nwas elicited from Mr. Mooney\nwho regretted the distress caused\nby the mishap and although they\ncould not accept full responsibility for t tie\" wielding \" of the\n\" weapon,\" agreed to shoulder a cleaning bill for the skirt involved.\nIn view of Mr. Mooney's current bad press, I felt in honour\nbound to recount the polite and\ncourteous treatment meted out to\nme.\nYours faithfully,\nC.M. THOMPSON.\nAN OPEN The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank\nTHE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX15 morphy day Few of the spectators will realise how much\nhard training has been done by the College VIII's this year. Since the beginning of term, members\nof the Boat Club have been training five days a week on top of rowing in the various I. C.B.C. crews which must be kept going if I.C. are to\nmaintain their superiority in the University and\nsucceed in open competition. Both the Morphy\nand the Lowry crews have been making the pilgrimages to Putney before breakfast three times a week, and also they have been circuit training twice\na week.\nThis is possible not only through the effort of\nthe crews but also the coaches, who quite voluntarily take on the task of guiding the crews to their\nbest possible performances in four weeks.\nC&G. Morphy is coached by Jan Smulders\nwhose crews have won the past two and many\nother Morphy races. The Lowry crew is coached\nby Dr. K. Cugan who has been very successful\nwith his crews in the past. Both R.S. M. Morphy\nand Lowry are coached by Charles Bristow, president of the Boat Club, who always produces remarkable results from the smallest college.\nR.C.S. have two new coaches\nthis year in the persons of Dr. A. Cameron and Geoff Pert. The former is better known in rowing\ncircles through his associations\nwith Cambridge University B.C. and Pembroke B.C., Cambridge.\nGeoff Pert has only recently\nstarted coaching, but he has\nrowed in the I.C. first VIII and\nalso gained his purple with U.L. first VIII in their 1961 crew.\nThis year all the crews have repainted their oars to make them\nidentifiable.\nAt the moment the result of the\nrace is anyone's guess but an experienced observer has said C&G by half a length. In all events it\nshould be a close race in the\nMorphy. In the Lowry the race is\nexpected to develop into a struggle\nbetween Guilds and Mines, but\nR.C.S. have been in hiding and on\nthe day they could well produce\nan unexpected turn of speed and\npower which could confound their\ncritics.\nMorphy Day, besides being the\noccasion for a rag on the mud\nflats of Putney, is the day on\nwhich intercollegiate boat races\nare rowed.\nBy D.

BEL8484\" Fives ? Whats that, a poor man's seven-a side ?\"\nThis is a stock question whenever this neglected sport is mentioned in conversation.\nThe answer, whether it be sketchy or enthusiastic, can do little\nco bring out the excitement of the game.\nSince few schools have fives courts, many sportsmen have never\nheard of fives and are too satisfied with their repertoire of sports to\nfind out.\nYet, when played well, fives demands standards of fitness, intelligence and sheer athletic ability to which few players of the cruder\nsports ever rise. In spite of this, fives is also a game which can\nbe played with great enthusiasm and enjoyment by the newcomer to\nthe sport.\nThe Rugby Fives Club in the College has led a shaky existence\nin its three years of life. This season, however, we have an encouraging increase in membership, and, as well as building up two competitive strings to fulfil our widening list of fixtures, weekly sessions\nare booked at the Hampstead Fives and Squash Club for those who\nplay for simple enjoyment.\nThis is an expanding club and we hope it will continue to be so,\nkeeping this sport very much alive.\nRugby\nSuccessful Start by M. TURNER\nThe Rugby Club has once\nagain made a very successful start\nto the season. /The First XV, unbeaten for three games without\nconceding a try, lost a hard game\nagainst Harlequins on Saturday,\n24th October. The highlight of\nthe game was the team's refusal\nto give in against superior individual skill and a half-time deficit\nof 8-0. A brilliant fight-back to\nlevel the scores brought great\nadulation from the few spec ta tors, only, alas, to see J. Young,\nthe ex-International and Oxford\nBlue go over for a try that was\nduly converted. This brought,\nnot capitulation from I.C., but\nrenewed effort; a few minutes\nfrom time, a superb fifty-yard\npassing movement ended in an\nun converted try by Mills.\nResult: I.C.11, Harlequins 13.\nThe Ex. First, Al and A2 XVs\nall boast unbeaten records, the\nAl XV, ably captained by R. Seaborn, needing only eight\npok its from the third game to\nreach the century.\nThe only failure in the \" B\" sides so far this term was the defeat of P. Bowler's \"International\nAll Star XV\" to Grays Thurock,\n8\u2014^3. Mr. Bowler, however,\nclaims that his arch-enemy,\nReich, made unsportsmanlike advances to the referee.\nOTHER RESULTS\nRifle: \"A\"30313036 Met. Police.\nRugby : 1st \u201432-3 Q.M. C.

Badminton\nGood Prospects\nThis season the Badminton\nClub has introduced another\nmen's team into the University\nLeague. The club now runs six\nteams in all; two men's teams in\nthe first division, two in the\nsecond division, a mixed, and a ladies' team. This will give all\nclub members a reasonable\nchance of j. playing in matches.\nThe men's first team Opened its\nfixtures with a good win over\nGoldsmiths, one of the strongest\nteams in the League. The score\nof 7\u20142 was rather flattering to\nI.C., and had Lee Kin Tat not\nplayed the match might have\nbeen lost. The prospects now of\nretaining the League Championship for the fourth year running\nare good. Although no Freshers\nplay in the first team at the mo-ment, the promising play of R. Milward, D. Howarth and I. Blair has certainly created\nhealthy competition for first team\nplaces.\n\n"

    "content": "STAFF STUDENT FELIX RELATIONSHIPS\nby O.G. BISH0P\nFreshers' Day has passed, with its usual work-play theme and\nvariations. The Freshers' Dinners have dwelt on the note that \" The\nstaff are human after all.\" But after the Theme and Variations\nhave been played out, we note that most of the staff are not in tuns\nwith students and, in fact, it could be said that staff travel through\ntime on the treble clef, while the students follow the bm a line. To\nthe outside observer, the music might seem quite pleasant, but in fact\nthe work is being played by two separate hands.\nThe theory of College Education tells of an integrated staff-student system, with a dual aim of advancement of knowledge, and\ndevelopment of character. The role of the staff, should be that of\nfriend, not that of a tutor acting in loco parent is. Many departments\nseem to regard an annual Sherry Party as the ultimate in social ising, and many so-called \" personal tutors \" see the solving of a few tutorial\nsheets, and the answering of a few personal problems through the\nyear as the sum total of obligation to their tutorial group. A few\nmay take their tutorial group to a Hall Dinner, but their main aim\nseems to be grinding the students through the education machine with\nthe minimum of mental mishap. Most of the staff are ignorant of\nthe activities of the Unions, there being, possibly, a higher percentage\nof \" Brown-Baggers \" amongst the staff than in the student body.\nBack to Square X It could be argued that the\nstudents should make the first\nmove. Nine metallurgists took\ntheir staff out to dinner last year\nat the expense of the students.\nAfter a week \" we were back to\nsquare X.\" We are still in the throes of\nFreshers' Dinners. We, in Guilds,\nusually manage to get about ten\nmembers of staff to each Departmental dinner. We are very glad\nto see them there as they represent\nthe staff members who are interested in students. And this year\nwe changed the format of our\ndinners so that the staff could participate more fully. However, the\nnumber of staff who do ask if they\nmay come is a very small fraction.\nIn Guilds we are very fortunate\nit seems, because both Mines and\nR.C.S. have difficulty in getting\nmore than two or three to their\ndinners. An R.C.S. dinner is\nvery pleasant to attend (Mines\ndinners are a little more more\n. . . er . . . lively), and I can see\nno reason why so many members\nof staff should find that they are\n\" unable to attend.\"\nExtention of School\nToo much of the attitude of the\nCollege seems to run in the \" ex\ntension of school\" groove, with\n9-5 staff and students and very little staff-student social integration\nwithin the residential student\nstructure. Staff-student spirit\nseems highest within the Civils, in\nGuilds, where field courses bring\nthe two groups together. Within\nthe other departments, the Sherry\nParty seems like tea with the\nHeadmaster.\nThe start of a solution lies in\nthe tutorial system. This ought\nto be carried through the three-year course with the accent placed\non personality development\nthrough useful discussion of the\nmany hardy themes that students\nare always talking about, the-aim\nbeing to develop reasoning and\nideological standpoints, and thus,\ndevelop character. This cannot\nbe done by a gro tty codfish tutor\nwith less life and character than a stale bun. The tutor should have\nan extrovert personality if he is to\ndraw comment from the students.\nHe should have evaluated his own\nideals, and lived outside his books\nand laboratory.\nUntouched by Hand\nAt present, any development of\ncharacter is left to the students\nthemselves . . . and presumably\nto the Unions. This works reasonably well with the people who\nwould social is e anyway, but it\nleaves a high percentage of students who pass through the de-g ree box untouched by human\nhand. They ride to and fro by\ntube, and live for three years in\nFulham without ever having to\ndecide on why people tick. We,\nthe so-called \" Officers of the\nUnion \" are just amateurs at the\nhandling of students.

Their influence is now wider, their\nresponsibilities greater than ever before. Today\neducation offers a creative career of increasing\nscope, in which people of ic'e as and initiative\ncan use their talents and attainments to the full.\nMany exciting new things are happening in the\neducation service . . . things in which you might\ntake part. Ask for the new booklet, C. E.G., at your University Appointments Board, or from\nthe Department of Education and Science,\nCurzon Street, London, W.1 COMMEMORATION Sir William Holford\nspeaks on Architecture\nDespite the amalgamation of many scientific and\nteaching institutions in the last century, there were\ncontinuous demarcation s of theory and professional practice.\nOne of the technologies to take this forked path\nwas that of Construction. But these two paths will\nconverge with the entry of the School ot the Architectural Association into the I.C. fold in 1967.\nModern Technology began in the early 19th century. Professions were Emerging concerned\nfor the first time with machines and the applications\nof scientific techniques to industry and commerce.\nAbove all the professional associations desired\nrespectability and integrity. In his inaugural address as President of the Institute of Civil Engineers in 1820, Thomas Telford observed \"Talents\nand Respectability are preferable to numbers.\"\nTHE ARCHITECTS\nSome 16 years later, the Institute of British\nArchitects was formed. Until then the architect's special function had been as an artist, for their\nclients needed few drawings. As a member of the\nprofessional association he had to be competent\nsimultaneously as a business adviser, technician\nand artist.\nThe two Institutions then slowly drifted apart,\nthe one concerning itself with machines and con-struct ions, the other interesting itself in the uses of\nbuildings, their style and setting. While architects\nstimulated craftsmanship, engineers made great\ntechnological contributions.\nTHE ARCHITECTURAL ASSOCIATION\nCertain young architects were disgruntled by\ntheir lack of education under the apprenticeship\nsystem. They stirred a group of architectural\ndraughts men into forming the Architectural Association in 1847.\nFrom the start there was sympathy between\nthe academic establishment of the day and the\nirregular, independant and unconventional school\ndesigned by architects for architects. The school's future link with I.C. is not expected to destroy its\ntraining methods or the independance which has\ngiven it such vitality in the past. In fact, it should\nstrengthen these traditions, for in the words of\nmodern architect Mies van der Rohe, \" Wherever\ntechnology reaches its fulfilment it transcends into\narchitecture.\"\n\n"

However, our Halls of Residence appear to be run for this\npurpose only, and not as I first understood, as an aid in promoting a good' life for all at college.\nIf you want to get into Hall, then when you fill your application\nform, do not admit that you take Q leading part in any of the college\nsocieties. If you boast of your\nclub activity, it will be taken for\ngranted that you will have no time\nleft over to promote hall spirit\u2014\nie. by joining the \" Hall Rugby\n8 \" or the \" Pea pushing team.\"\nKeogh Hall is known to reject\npeople who do endless work for\ntheir college, but little for hall.\nIn I.C. there are about 700\nplaces in hall, for some 3,100\nstudents; this means that at any\none time 20 per cent Are in hall.\nNow a quarter of these (the hall\nspirits) stay in hall for^a second\nyear to keep the \" Pea pushing\nteam \" together, which means that\nthere is only 15 per cent of new\nstudents get into hall per year.\nLast year at a Guilds Union\nmeeting we had a debate concerning college life, and whether it\nshould be based on the constituent\ncollege system as it is at present,\nor on a hall's system. The meeting was in favour of retaining the\npresent system because the majority of peole, 80 per cent are\nnot in hall.\nIf some day there is enough\nplaces in hall for even 50 per cent\nof students all the time, then I would be prepared to accept a system based on halls. While the\npresent situation prevails I think\nit is grossly unfair to run the halls\nfor their own sake. If they continue to do so, then college life\nwill soon collapse...\nYours not in hall,\nP.J. MOSS\nDear Sir,\nMay I appeal to you to be a little more fair in your comments\nand reporting. I'm sure no one\nreally believes, for instance, that\nanyone struck a woman just for a mascot.\nMascot whipping, if not carried\nto extremes can be good fun, as a large section of all three Unions\nwill agree. Breaking and entering,\nletting down tyres, removing\ntrousers etc. have all been done\nbefore by all three colleges.\nWe have suffered similarly without venting our anger in print.\nAfter your report, the staff can be\nexcused for refusing fresher's dinners invitations and thinking\nthat we are all louts.\nYou failed to report that Guilds\nmistook your own car for that of\nan RC.S. man. The aerial was\nprobably broken when they\nrocked it. I can't imagine anyone\njust going up to it in the street and\nsnapping it.\nI would like to have seen more\nsubtlety in the R.C.S. attempt to\npinch the Spanner from a flat,\nespecially in view of Guilds extremely cunning and inoffensive\nremoval of Theta from our Dinner. I fail to see the need for\nbiased reporting, however.\nYours faithfully,\nC.S. EVANS\n(Vice-President, R.C.S.) A Newly\nDiscovered Manuscript\nor A Reply to Yogi Bishop.\nAnd let noi our collegiate royalty\nBe thus unwisely slandered:\nLet not citizen, bishop, still less foul mechanical,\nTamper with historic and traditional place.\nQuestion virtue or query well-earned station.\nLet our laurels show our status and our temperament.\nAnd thou, sweet cousin Bedford, tarry awhile :\nDo not abandon thy leafy and secured fortress\nFor new and grey if royal quarters.\nFor thee are not fit miners, nor mechanical s; Those sweaty toilers should not dare even kiss\nThy long black protective boot.\nAttend thou only for men of good degree,\nMen fresh from a well-considered College of Life,\nBachelors yet in state if not in mind or act;\nAnd with them only venture forth.bedecked,\nUpon the neon stage of our society.\nW.S. Since these letters were received, we have been notified (hat the\nNUS question will be brought up at a Union debate this year. We\nfeel, however, that the letters below retain their value in this new light.\nDear Sir,\nMany fresher s at the Societies day at the beginning of term were\npuzzled to find no N.U.S. information stall. This was explained when\nthey found that I.C alone out of ths major university colleges is not\na member, but perhaps the puzzlement still remains in many minds.\nI.C., in fact, has had a long flirtation with the question of joining\nN.U.S. We did join for a very short period after the war but left\nbecause many people suspected the political nature of N.U.S. \u2014in\nparticular N.U.S. affiliation to I.U.S. Then two years ago a majority\nvote in the Union was in favour of joining, but when those against\nforced a re-opening of business, a very much smaller Union meeting\nreversed the decision. This presumably was because the critics turned\nup in force while the pros rested on their laurels and didn't bother.\nUnfortunately the whole campaign, especially the reversed decision,\nwas fought in a bitter and unpleasant way, and there was more muck-stirring than honest discussion.\nAt first sight it would seem that the advantages of joining with\na national body, that is a powerful pressure group on such matters\nas grants, educational policy, tea dM ng conditions etc., would be over-w hel ming. But, on the other hand, this would mean greater contact\nand.association with colleges that have little in common with us. Again\nin favour of joining, is the large number of trading concessions in\nmost large towns, and the cheap holidays that N.U.S. sponsors. But\non the other hand there is the cost of affiliating I.C. which would come\nto about 2/- per head per year. However, the pro-N.U.S. people\npoint out that this would be paid by the local education authorities'\ngrants to I.C. Union, not be individual students. Clearly we can see\nthat there are strong arguments on both sides of this issue.\nIn the past N.U.S. has received the support of many labour M.P.s so obviously now with a labour government N.U.S. will be in a much\nstronger position to make representations and get things done on behalf\nof its members. Clearly we at I.C. must carefully consider whether\nwe want to be associated with N.U.S. in these conditions. We must\nre-open this question as soon as possible. Let us hope that this time\nwe can discuss it reasonably, listen to the arguments of both sides,\nmake a decision and stick to it.\nS. JEFFERS,\nPhysics P.G. The Editor of Felix,\nDear Sir,\nWe, the undersigned members of the Social Clubs Committee,\nconsider that there is an overwhelming case for I.C. applying for full\nmembership of N.U.S. Our reasons are :\n(1) The facilities available for contact with other colleges. The\nI.C. student is almost notorious for his narrow outlook\u2014due to having\nlittle or no contact with non-scientists. The obvious way of remedying\nthis is to make use of N.U.S. facilities for nation-wide conferences,\ndebates, competitions, etc.\n(2) Although at present students can make use of agreements for\ncheap travel, the facilities offered by N.U.S. are superlative. For\ninstance, there is a25 per cent reduction for students travelling between\nhome and e ducat i oid institutes in Europe and Africa, as well as\nnumerous holiday reductions.\n(3) l.C. would be in a much stronger position to bring influence\nto bear on the government on issues such as grants, education policy\nand national insurance for students.\nBy joining N.U. S.,I.C. students will not only gain financially\nfrom membership but will be in a position to make positive contribution to national student welfare.\nS. Jeffers of Comm. Soc.\nG.

The response was rather poor (33%) and as\na result, quickly dismissed by the Athletic Ground\nCommittee. However, just to keep the matter\nbrewing, it was agreed that a representative of\nFullers should visit Harlington and taste for him-self. He appeared one Wednesday and proceeded\nto drink only shandy! It was agreed, though, that\ncask London Pride (ca. 1/9) be served as an alternative to the ordinary bitter (l/6d). There, most un satisfactorily, the matter rests.\nThe whole episode is an example of the incompetence of the Union to organise a case for itself\nbased on strong support from the majority of\nStudents concerned.

The first was the\ncrushing defeat of L.S.E. on October 21st: the I.C. forwards, one goal up at half-time through a Phillips short corner, swept through the home\nteam, finally winning by the clear margin of 5-0.\nIt must be added that I.C.'s first spectator contributed greatly to the margin of the win. However\nhis photographic talents did not match the vocal.\nThe second league fixture was on October 28th versus Kings College 1st XI, at Harlington. The\npitch was extremely fast and rather springy, the\nopening exchanges being marked by both sides'\ninability to collect their passes. I.C. took the initiative shortly before half-time when inside-right\nI. Kershaw put a centre from N. Mackenzie into\nthe net. Soon afterwards one of King's insides\nwas taken to hospital with a badly cut knee.\nThe second half play was somewhat scrappy,\nthe forwards getting very close to scoring several\ntimes, whilst at the other end the defence was\nencountering problems in dealing with the very\nfluid \" four-man Kings \" attack. In the final stages,\nthe loss of one man told on the\nvisitors' strength and the end\ncame with I.C. pressing hard.\nThis win gives the team a good\nchance of winning the coveted\nleague trophy and much encouragement for the 1st round of\nthe U.L.

    "content": "FELIX13 Cattle Market\nDear Sir,\nI am all for Felix containing controversial articles, but only if\nthe reporting contained in them is accurate. However, Peter Cartwright's article on the Cattle Market contained two statements, both\nof which are completely untrue.\nI consider his attack on Bedford College girls cheap and nasty\nand more in keeping with the drivel published in the sex s at ional Sunday papers\nI challenge him or anyone else to prove that Bedford girls are\nstatistically inferior (vital or otherwise) to any other collection of the\nfair sex.\nThe people who usually complain about the lack of talent are t lte anti-social characters who gate-crash the dance by co ning to the dance\nafter 10 o 'clock when there are no ticket-collectors. They apparently\ndo not realise that all the best talent has paired off by this time, and\nin any case they \\have no right to grumble, having got in for not hmg. Peter Cartwright also states that \" a very few people were waltzing to the strains of Phil Jennings.\" From the interval to the end of\nthe dance it was full\u2014not everybody wishes to spend Saturday evening\nin crush-hours-tube conditions.\nFinally, I would like to state that, at the present time, I have no\npersonal connection with any member of Bedford College\nYours faithfully.\nPseudonyms\n\" Felix \" Editor.\nI am appalled, nay, horrified, by the subversive, ses ation a list tactics used by a member of your staff in writing what I can only\ndescribe as pernicious poison-pen letters above a name which is all\ntoo obviously false. I am reliably informed of the writer's identity\nand was particularly astounded to learn of his underhand activities\nin view of his responsible position on your staff\nI cannot even accept his grouse as having reasonable foundation.\nMore attention could have been paid to his letter had he the courage\nto sign it with the names by which he is known at the Registry.\nI am further astounded that you, Sir, should publish such an\nhorrible letter; you must bear as much, if not more, of the blame as\nyour misguided, pseudonym o us colleague.\nMay I state that I am quite prepared to have MY identity made\npublic when this policy of disguising your staff is abandoned. 1 am\nsure that there are sufficient writers of sufficiently high quality and\nintegrity to make this policy completely unnecessary and that such\na policy should be beneath the Editor of a newspaper responsible to\nthe student-body of Imperial College.\nI am, sir,\nYours etc.,\n\" Expergefaciens.\"\nH.

One\nbursts from time to time, but why,\noh, why does Felix have to publicise them.\nThe hop in question was specifically organized as a joint venture\nwith Bedford. To denigrate\nthose \" dregs of Bedford Life \"\nwho turned up in good faith shows\nan appalling lack of taste. Felix\nshould be a forthright, virile organ\nbut surely not at the expense of\ngood manners. And the Editor\nshould be the guardian of those.\nYours,\nDON LEEPER\nOther letters have been received\nconcerning Mr. Cartwright's article in FELIX no. 207.\nTo Charity\nIt has been brought to the\nnotice of the I.C. executive com-mitte e, that a discrepancy occurred in the selling price of hop\ntickets in the S. S. buildings on\nFriday 23rd of October. This has\nbeen investigated to the satisfaction of the executive and they are\nunited in the belief that the overcharging by sixpence on 29 tickets\nwas done without intent. The\nsurplus accumulated i.e.14/6 is\nbeing forwarded to the charity\ncarnival fund.\nSir,\nI.C. Union,\nThe Jaws of Hell,\nI resent the callous way in\nwhich your Late News Editor\nembarrasses l CW Arians by revealing the murky depths of his\nprivate life. Whether Mr. Needham wears pyjamas or not is of\nlittle concern or interest, but it is\nworth remembering that journalists have been jailed for refusing\nto betray their confidences.

    "content": "FELIX3 PET\u00a3R CARTWRIGHT AND RICHARD WALKER INVESTIGATE\nTHE MEWS AND US\nRelations between Southside and its Prince's Gate Mews neighbours are now in a serious state. So many complaints about noise\nand nuisance have been sent by the Mew's residents to the Hall\nWardens and to Westminster City Council that an injunction is\nthreatened.\nAre these complaints justified ? There can be no doubt that\ntoo many definitely are. Here are some extracts from letters received\nfrom Mfcws residents by the Senior Warden, Mr. Stephenson, who has\ndone much work to alleviate this problem :\n\" Record-players, radios, raucous laughter, etc., enough to drive\nthe most patient people insane. . . .\"\n\" For the fourth time this week, I have been woken up by your\nstudents climbing out on the roof or into each other's rooms. . . .\"\n\" The dust-bin lids were used as footballs and kicked the length\nof the Mews. . . .\"\n\"Missiles thrown from windows . . . paper darts . . . empty\nfood tins . . . milk-bottles . . . water . . .\"\nInjunction Pending?\nMany of these letters are reasonable in tone and there seems\nto be little or no exaggeration. It\nis unfortunate, but it seems that\nCollege hooliganism is not solely\nconfined to mascot-collecting.\nWestminster City Council\ncould ask for and probably get\nan injunction against the College,\ncalling for the noise and nuisance\nto end. If more complaints were\nthen received this could even\nlead to the closure of Southside.\nNot only would this render 400\nstudents homeless, but wo if W be\na damaging loss of prestige for\nthe college, which could directly\naffect the welfare of every one of\nits students. Thus, this problem\naffects all of us.\nThe Problems\nWhat\nhow\nThere are three chief problems\n(1) Noise and nuisance in the\nMews.\n(2) Noise from the Union,\nchiefly the dining-hall.\n(3) Noise and disturbance\nfrom study-bedrooms.\nThe first problem has already\nreceived attention. From 8.30\np.m. the Mews entrance to Southside is now locked, and students'\ncars and motorcycles have been\nbanned from the Mews. I.C. people returning from the \"Ennis-more\" etc., now walk(?) past the\neast side of the Halls and enter\nseems that the number of Stomps\nwill be limited. The matter is now\nup for discussion at I.C. Council.\nNoise and disturbance from\nstudy-bedrooms can only be reduced by individual co-operation.\nUnfortunately, an even higher\nstandard of co-operation is required from the people who live\nnear the south-facing wall of\nSouthside. If such people have\nany number of visitors in their\nrooms, they should shut the windows and leave the door open\nfor ventilation.\nMilk Bottles\nSurely no one can justify hoo li are the problems, and\ncan they be dealt with?\ngan is m, especially the dropping of\nmilk bottles from windows ?\nSuch childish, loutish action deserves severe punishment, and if\nanyone is caught, he may well be\nmade an example.\nThe Wardens and Hall Committees are considering this whole\nproblem, and among their worries\nis the form of punishment for\nnoise and nuisance offenders. At\npresent, there is no intermediate\nform of punishment between a mere verbal warning and the\nultimate punishment of expulsion\nfrom Hall.\nHalcyon Days\nThe only answer to this pro b lem, like most, lies in com-promise. The Mews residents\nmust accept a certain increase in\nnoise level from the halcyon days\npre-Southside. Equally, Southside\nresidents, especially those facing\nsouth onto the Mews, must do all\nthey can to keep the noise down\u2014\nnot only for their benefit, but for\nthe college as a whole.\nIn such a small space it is impossible to cover such a complex\nproblem at all fully. I apologise\nin advance for any omissions and\nhope that any critics will bear in\nmind the main point of this article\n\u2014that students alone, especially\nthose in Southside, can alleviate\nthe problem of noise and nuisance\nOnly this way can we gain the\nessential good-will of our neigh-b ours. by the north side, facing the\ngardens.\nMews will noi be directly attributed to I.C. students, who are\ncertainly not the sole offenders.\nElectronic Ban\nUnion noise seems to come\nchiefly from the Stomps Last\nyear two Public Health Inspectors\nvisited a Mews house during a Stomp, and normal conversation\nwas drowned by the row. Amplified equipment (electric guitars)\nis now banned at Stomps, and it\nCOROLEE DIVE\nBecause of difficulties with a borrowed compressor, there were\nserious doubts on Friday afternoon, 16th October, of a dive taking\nplace that week-end. But by 8 p.m. six members of IC Underwater\nClub were on their way, bound for the eastern shore of Southampton\nWater.\nThe base for the dive was a30 foot cabin cruiser, belonging to\nthe parents of a committee member. Saturday dawned fine, and\nwe set in the Corolee to a spot off Sandown and Shanklin, on the\neastern coast of the Isle of Wight The choice of the site was poor as\nthe water was very murky ; but our diving officer made history by\nbeing the first man, or woman, to be seasick on Corolee.\nConditions were perfect, however, for Sunday's dive off Swanage\nwith hot sun and calm sea. Excellent diving was found in some 40\nfeet of water off the Old Harry Rocks ; at the bottom visibility was\nseveral feet and plenty of marine life was seen.\nVoluntary\nService Overseas\nVSO provides opportunities for qualified men and women\nwanting to serve for a year or more in the developing\ncountries of the world.\nVSO needs graduates from every University faculty for\nteaching posts, medicine, agriculture, engineering administrative and social services and many other projects. VSO\nis interviewing now for 1965.\nVSO offers a unique chance of seeing other countries and\nother ways of life to volunteers before they settle down\nto a career. It presents a challenge to those who want to\nmake a personal contribution towards meeting real needs.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONSULT YOUR UNIVERSITY\nAPPOINTMENTS BOARD, OR WRITE DIRECT TO\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS\n3, HANOVER STREET, W. l.

WILLIAMS\nProduction Manager Alan Oxley\nSports Editor Dave Hunt\nLate News Editor Ted Needham\nSales Andrew Mayo,\nJocelyn Mackintosh\nBusiness Robin Webster,\nPeter Combes,\nGeoff. Bean,\nBarry Pichler\nCartoonists Brian Bull,\nChris Wright\nPhotographers John Cawson,\nWill Chorley\nPRESENTATION\nWe have received various complaints this term on our treatment\nof articles submitted for publication. Many writers expect us to print\ntheir material literally, in spite of spelling and grammatical errors and\nwhether it ma^es interesting reading or not. There are grumbles,\ntoo, at headlines verging on sensationalism.\nThe fact is that the Felix staff are journalists. They have to\npresent to the mass of I.C. students news and views on college affairs.\nWe believe that to do this successfully we must make every item\nattract the general reader. The first essential, therefore, is an interest-ing, snappy headline. Thefirstparagraph must continue to hold the\nreader's attention if the writer is to succeed in broadcasting the whole\nforce of his script. ,\n. Any articles wh'ch, in our opinion, are not journalistic, will be\nrewritten and shortened if necessary. We will, however, publish in\npart or in toto any serious article we receive by the Wednesday evening preceding publication. It may be held over to a later issue.\nMORPHY DAY\nThis can be enjoyed by all without disturbing the general public.\nWe can have just as much, if not more, fun de bagging people on\nthe towpath and throwing flour all over the place as in charging to\none of the nearby tube stations and scattering the innocent bystanders.\nAll those who go to Putney with the constituent colleges know what to\nexpect. Also, the police know what to expect. But the general\npublic do not.\nAfter the fiasco of a disorganised riot last year the officers of\nthe constituent colleges met to work out ways of improvement. They\nonly succeeded in improving the organisation. Surely anything that\nmay prevent lawlessness should be incorporated. Travel to and from\nPutney in coaches, an idea that was rejected this year, would be a first step. An approximate timetable would be some advantage for\nthen the general student would know when the boat races were to\ntake place (the object of the exercise).\nFRESHERS DINNERS\n\"The first-year students' formal introduction to College life.''\nThis was how one prominent Guildsman last year summed up\nFreshers' Dinner. This year another Guildsman said they were \" A chance for second-year to have some fun ;first-years don't enter into\nit.\" The true picture of the Freshers' Dinner probably lies between\nthese two extremes.\nIn this issue Mr. Bishop writes that Staff-Student relationships have\na\" We-They \" attitude and that until this is changed Staff will not\nqueue up to pay to see them getting drunk. This year Messrs.\nBishop, Sadhvani and Kearns have made great strides in improving\nthe tone of the dinners and those staff who came appeared to enjoy\nthem far more.\nThe R.C.S. mixed dinner in Southside, was enjoyed by all, as\ncould be testified by the fact that people were chatting over coffee\nuntil nearly midnight.\nAt fresher s' dinners the majority of speakers can only amuse\nby telling a continuous stream of dirty jokes ; sp sec he s can attract\nattention without resorting to vulgarity. Only when this has been\nachieved will Freshers' Dinners be fully appreciated by the Staff.\ncoLA PLACE IN HALL\nEvery Summer, the Union Presidents nominate\nsome people doing important Union jobs for places\nin the halls during the next session. By the beginning of the session, some of these nominees have\nresigned their official positions but keep their\nplaces in hall, often for a third year. This is a travesty of the regulations, and extremely unfair\nto the many people on the waiting lists. Hall\nselection procedures are obscure enough as it is\u2014\nthe Union should demand to know more t acts about these places and how they are a lot ted, as a first step to throwing more light on the whole\nsituation.\nA QUESTION OF ATTITUDE\nI was astonished to hear that a staff member\nthought it necessary to tell some Guildsmen how\nto behave at their forthcoming Freshers' Dinner.\nThe Unions and older Halls have built up a tradition of responsible behaviour, without intervention\nfrom the staff, mainly because students are treated\nas adults and not as members of a glorified sixth\nform. It appears, however, that there are people\nwho subscribe to the latter idea. We must show\nthem how ridiculous this is.\nSWINGIN' COMMEMORATION DAY\nCommemoration day, in all its antiseptic spl en dour, has come, been and gone again virtually\nunnoticed. What to do? A beat group to liven\nup that dreary Albert Hall ceremony perhaps?\ncuT T To add variety, the platform procession could\nconverge, shaking, from all parts of the building,\nwith one or two professors coming down ropes\nfrom the roof. Better still, why not record the\nwhole thing beforehand at 16 rpm, and play it\nback on the day at 78? To revive flagging interest,\na competition to see who can find the hardest\nMooney sandwich before 6 p.m., followed by a special (con versa tzi one) showing of \" The Silence \"\n(dubbed with the sound track of \" Camelot\").\nIs it remotely possible, dare one say it, that the\nCommem. Ball could be held in a slightly more\nconvenient and less expensive establishment?\nSeriously though, the College seems to be throwing\naway an awful lot of money to no purpose.\nSENNET\nOne becomes used to the misprints and gross\ninaccuracies that seem to crop up in Sennet every\ntime our name is mentioned. One thing, however\n\u2014why can't they call us I.C. like everyone else?\nTHE ASSISTANT EDITOR\nWRITES. . .\non\nfelix\nprogress\nYou were, perhaps, as dismayed as we were at\nthe number of spelling errors, particularly in head-lines, in the last issue of FELIX. Always we aim\nat perfection in this sphere; but with production\nstill requiring the best part of a week, we cannot\nafford to further delay publication without totally\nlosing topical it y. Changes for the better are continuously being\nmade. Increased advertising allowed us to embark\nwith the last issue on a plan whereby much of the\nheadlining will be done by our staff rather than\nby the printer. Also we tried a new column-width,\ndid the setting-up four days earlier, and introduced\npage one as \" news in a nutshell.\" All three\nplans take further steps forward in this issue.\nThis week-end, for che first time, FELIX was\nrepresented at a Student Newspapers' Conference.\nThis was not the annual NUS event, for which we\ndo not qualify, but a new one sponsored by ULU.\nAdvice gleaned from this will be put to goad use.\nAs earlier statements indicate, FELIX staff\nare severely conscious of the appearance of this\nnewspaper. However, the most important item is\ncontent. And that is where you can help us, for\nour small staff cannot be everywhere. Just let us\nknow immediately what is going on, and we will\nmake it presentable.\nOne story is better covered by two people than\nby no one.\nD.I. WILLIAMS.\n\n"

Although\na very reliable engine, as there\nare no moving parts, its use is\nlimited because it can only\noperate at speeds greater than\n300 m.p.h. On the structure side, several\nrigs were shown, designed to give\nexperimental verification s of\nmodern theory, some of it developed in the Department.\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT\nVisitors were greeted in the\nconcourse by a large red and\nyellow flag bearing a symbolic\nbeast, the whole being of obscure\nrelevance. Men vainly searching\nfor the \" gents \" were confronted\nwith doors marked \"Techni-cia ns,\"\" Academic Staff\" or\n\" Cleaners,\" whilst both men and\nwomen had doubts about \"Stu-dent's Lavatory.\"\nA display of sensuously shimmying springs in the corridor enticed guests into the Vibrations\nLab., where they could learn\nabout railway vibration problems and rigid body vibrations in\ngeneral. The Mechanisms Lab.\nshowed their work on artificial\nlimbs, and the Applied Mechanics\nLab. had a display of Plastic\nFracture Mechanics.\nELECTRICAL\nENGINEERING\nThere were many demonstrations set up in the E.E. Dept.,\nvarying from a model train driven\nby linear induction motor to electron microscopes. Professor\nLaithwaite kept an aluminium\nball suspended in the air and occasionally fired steel washers in\nthe air by some supernatural\nmeans. There was also a variable speed induction motor,\nevery traction engineer's dream\n(the snag being the cost of the\ncontrol gear).\nProbably the most interesting\ndemonstration was in the lecture\ntheatre, where teaching by television was on shown to the accompaniment of Mr. Goodlad's taped commentary. Also there\nwas a fascinating demonstration\nof respiratory control of the heart\nrate.\nWe regret that reports were not\nreceived from the other City &\nGuilds de pts. Group Briefing for a 'Management Game', Ashorne Hill.\nTraining for Management Nearly 1400 managers and assistant managers have attended\nresidential courses atthe British Iron and Steel Federation's own management college in Warwickshire. Courses are\ndesigned to enable men from different departments and\ncompanies to see the steel industry in perspective, to\nincrease their technical and commercial knowledge, to meet\nleading figures in the industry and to practise committee\nwork. These courses also help them to develop their capacity\nfor solving management problems, both human and technical and occasionally to study specialist techniques, such\nas Industrial Market Research and Systems Analysis.\nThe Steel industry regards management as both an Art and\na Science. In addition to its intensive programme of management training, the Federation is currently engaged in a substantial programme of research into management\nproblems within the industry.\nSteel gives a man the opportunity\nto rise by ability and achievement,\nirrespective of age, in one of\nBritain's biggest manufacturing\nindustries. This is a diverse and\nalive industry which welcomes\nmen who can take responsibility\nand play a part in the many new\ndevelopments now taking place\u2014\nin manufacture, in research, in\napplication.
