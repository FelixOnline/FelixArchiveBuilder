Of these, one\nwas Mad Men, a series I discovered,\nbinge watched, and fell in love with,\nall in the space of about two weeks.\nCentring on the enigmatic and\ndapper Don Draper, played by a\nperfectly cast Jon Hamm, the show\nfollows the exploits of the men and\nwomen of the Sterling-Cooper\nadvertising agency; as they attempt\nto navigate through the rapidly\nchanging world of 1960s New York.\nThe driving force of the series is\nthe strength of its characters. There\nare no one-dimensional characters,\nno real \u2018villains\u2019, and everyone gets\nmoment to shine. At first Draper\nseems to the platonic ideal of the\n60s Ad-man; suave, charming,\nclever, a veritable James Bond-type.\nHowever, the first episode expertly\nand efficiently deconstructs this,\nrevealing all his flaws and failings.\nNo, Don Draper is not necessarily a\ngood man. However, he is trying his\ndamndest; which is what makes him\nsuch a compelling lead. We root for\nhim to succeed and overcome, even\nas we see him fall,right on the verge,\nbecause of his own shortcomings.\nThis is, of course, not all the\npiece is. In its scale, it very much\nfeels like a \u2018Great American novel\u2019;\na modern day \u2018Great Gatsby\u2019,\nwarning us of the pitfalls of avarice\nand overindulgence. It destroys that\nold adage \u2018things were better in my\nday\u2019 (in this case the 60s), showing\nus the past in all its grimy glory.\nSuch things are always deftly and\nrespectfully handled.\nOne of the central narratives\nfollows Peggy Olsen (Elisabeth\nMoss), as she attempts to make it\nthrough the male dominated and\nin the 21st\ncentury.\nDon\u2019t get the impression that\nthe show is all serious, however.\nThere are plenty of funny moments\nspread throughout, and showrunner\nMatthew Weiner goes to great\nlengths to ensure viewers are never\nbored or overwhelmed by drama.\nThere is an understanding that, as in\nreal life, both are required to keep\nthings believable. In fact, one of the\nshows greatest comedic triumphs\ncomes with the episode \u2018Guy walks\ninto an advertising agency\u2019 (S3E6),\nwhich in my book is perhaps one\nof the greatest and meta titles an\nepisode of anything has ever had.\nWithout spoiling anything, I\u2019ll say\nthat realising its significance will\nmake you smirk. The title coupled\nwith events towards the end serve\nto turn the whole episode into one\nlong hilarious, if cruel joke. Then,\nof course, there\u2019s that wonderfully\nsurreal dance number in \u2018Waterloo\u2019\n(S7E7).\nThe writing has a beautiful way\nof endearing to you those who\nonly a second ago you hated. The\nmisogynistic advertising world.\nThere are also the subtle touches,\nsuch as the rampant alcoholism\n(though admittedly I\u2019d love to\nhave that kind of bar in my office\none day) or firm partner Roger\nSterling\u2019s (John Slattery) hatred of\nthe Japanese, due to his part in the\nSecond World War. These, while\nbarely commented on by characters\nin the era,are blatantly obvious to us\nKiernan Shipka (playing Draper\u2019s\nyoung daughter), are some of the\nbest I\u2019ve seen.\nI\u2019d be remiss in forgetting\nto highlight the downright\npoetic synergy of direction/\ncinematography and writing.\nWhether it\u2019s the powerfully\nmetaphorical sequence at the end\nof \u2018Shoot\u2019 (S1E9), or the incredible\ncontinuous shot of Don Draper\nwalking set to \u2018You only live twice\u2019\n(ironically signifying his fall back\ninto his old habits) in\u2018The Phantom\u2019\n(S5E13), every so often the show\nthrows these moments at you that\njust scream \u2018iconic\u2019. The settings\nused are often just as important\nas the acting, with them reflecting\nthe characters or being symbolic of\nthis. An example of this is the use\nof bright and over saturated colours\nfor California, in contrast with\nthe relatively industrial and faded\ncolours of New York; used in order\nto signify the happiness and peace\nDraper feels in the West rather than\nat home. Interestingly, the colours\nand materials also have a distinctly\nflimsy and artificial feel to them,\nreflecting the constructed and easily\nbreakable nature of this illusion.\nFrankly, I can keep gushing about\nit, but the exquisite quality of Mad\nMen is something that simply must\nbe experienced. It succeeds because\nall of its elements come together\nwonderfully. If I can\u2019t convince you,\nperhaps the show\u2019s 16 Emmys and\nfive Golden Globes will.\nMad Men is available on Netflix\nand Sky\ndialogue again is a testament to the\nskill of the writers. It ranges from\ncharming, to witty, to pithy, often\nall at once. Consistently believable,\nwhat it never manages to be is dull\nor stilted. This is all to say nothing\nof the calibre of the cast.It\u2019s obvious\neveryone is acting their heart out,\nand this really helps cement these\ncharacters and make the viewers\nthoroughly invested in them.\nEven the child actors, particularly\nIn its scale, it\nvery much feels\nlike a \u2018Great\nAmerican novel\u2019;\na modern day\n\u2018Great Gatsby\u2019,\nwarning us of\nthe pitfalls of\navarice and\noverindulgence\nThe settings\nused are often\njust as important\nas the acting,\nwith them\nreflecting the\ncharacters or\nbeing symbolic\nof this\nThe Men (and Women) who Sold the World.

Photo Credit: The CW\nGrant Gustin delivers an incredible performace as Barry Allen AKA The Flash. Photo Credit: The CW\nP\nretty much any new TV\nseries has a period of\nadjustment where the\nactors settle into their\nroles and the writers capture the\nshow\u2019s voice. Superhero shows\nare of course, no exception to this\nrule, as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\ncan testify. What makes the Flash\nunique is that it was able to hit\nthe ground running straight off\nand just continually got better over\nthe course of the next few months.\nStrictly speaking, it didn\u2019t have to\nstart from scratch; being a spinoff of\nArrow, some of the characters and\nideas were already established prior\nto its pilot.\nA star feature of the show is\nGrant Gustin\u2019s performance as\nBarry Allen, a forensic scientist and\nthe series\u2019 titular hero. Gustin gives\nus a Barry Allen who is immensely\nlikeable and impossible not to relate\nwith. A stark contrast from Stephen\nAmell\u2019s intense and broody Oliver\nQueen, Gustin brings an enjoyable\ncombination of youthful energy,\ndelicate poignancy as well as a touch\nof Peter Parker-esque awkwardness\nto the table.\nIt isn\u2019t just the main hero who\ngives an amazing performance,\nit is the entire supporting cast.\nA lot of the show\u2019s driving force,\ndrama and emotional core comes\nfrom Barry\u2019s relationships with his\ncircle of friends, families and allies.\nAll the possible relationships are\nexploited to great effect. The two\nmain highlights are Jesse L. Martin\nas Barry\u2019s adoptive father and Tom\nCavanagh as his mentor. Martin\nbrings a nice touch of warmth to\nhis role, both as an anxious father\nand a man perplexed by all the crazy\nthings around him. Cavanagh\u2019s\nHarrison Wells is the show\u2019s most\ncaptivating character, appearing to\ncare for Barry while also being more\nthan what meets the eye, eventually\nbecoming season one\u2019s main\nantagonist. There isn\u2019t enough time\nto go through all the characters but\nthan film. Weekly episodes can\ndo serialised storytelling in a way\na couple of films each year just\ncan\u2019t. Of course a major advantage\nof films is having more time and\nmoney to bring the powers and\nspectacles to life. For a TV drama\nhowever, the effects of the Flash are\ndamn impressive. His super-speed\nis rendered well in creative ways as\nwell as the abilities of the numerous\nvillains. A particular highlight\nis Gorilla Grodd, a completely\ncomputer-animated villain who\nheavily featured in two episodes so\nfar.\nThe show is also never afraid to\nembrace the more colourful, lighthearted and ostentatious features of\ncomic books.The show is easily able\nto juggle between time-travel and\ntelepathic gorillas while making\neverything work in a universe\nwhere powers are new and most\npeople don\u2019t know how to react to\nthem. The show gets bolder with\nthis as it goes along, with season\ntwo introducing the concept of\nthe multiverse with dopplegangers\nfrom a parallel earth. The humour\nplays a big part in keeping things\ngrounded and not letting the drama\nget out of hand. With all the fun\nand flashy elements of comics, the\nshow provides a welcome change of\npace from the dark and grounded\nadaptations going around.\nWhile the show follows a standard\n\u2018villain-of-the-week\u2019 format, it is\none done rather well.While some of\nvillains come off as underdeveloped\nand one-dimensional, others\nhave more nuanced and stronger\nappearances. Reverse-Flash and\nZoom, the main antagonists of\nseasons one and two are done well\nas complex and terrifying main\nvillains. Mark Hamill also shows up\nas the Trickster, a role he had from\nthe 1990\u2019s short-lived Flash series.\nHis debut episode also proved that\nthe show is capable of going into\nfull-on camp territory without\nlosing sight of its goal.\nA major standout episode is the\nseason one finale \u201cFast Enough\u201d.\nIt does away with the \u201cfinal\nconfrontation\u201dtrend, moving that to\nthe penultimate episode. It was an\nintensely emotional finale, forcing\nBarry to decide just how much he\u2019s\nwilling to sacrifice in order to save\nhis mother. Every actor was on full\nform and it felt like a great payoff\nto a season\u2019s worth of buildup. It\nalso ended on a cliffhanger which,\nwhile aggravating, left the window\nopened for anything. This is nicely\nfleshed out and explored in season\ntwo.\nThe Flash is set to get his own\nsolo movie in 2018, but featuring\na completely new cast, story and\neven Barry Allen in the form of\nEzra Miller. While it\u2019s an unusual\nand interesting decision, the movie\nversion definitely has a lot to\nprove with the show setting the\nbar so high. With great acting and\nnever being afraid to embrace its\ncomic book roots, the Flash has an\nimpressively high quality level and\nserves as a strong blueprint of how\nto do superheroes on TV.\nThe Flash is available on Amazon\nPrime\nrest assured, everyone has their own\nquirks, traits and their time to shine.\nLooking at all the underlying\nconflicts and how they develop\novertime, it\u2019s clear the Flash is\nable to succeed because it adopts\nthe serialised nature of superhero\ncomics really well. With each\nepisode having its fair share of twists\nand surprises as well as a climactic\ncliffhanger, it serves as a reminder\nthat ultimately, TV is inherently\na better medium for superheroes\nUltimately, TV\nis inherently a\nbetter medium\nfor superheroes\nthan film\nThe show is also\nnever afraid to\nembrace the\nmore colourful,\nlight-hearted\nand ostentatious\nfeatures of\ncomic books\n\n"

Shockingly,\nsome still believe that the glass\nceiling for women is a myth, despite\nglobal statistics. Only one woman\nhas ever headlined Coachella, solo\nexhibitions by female artists have\nonly made up 25% of the Tate\nModern\u2019s roster since 2007, and so\non ad infinitum.\nI truly hope that Champagne\nLife\u2019s aura of liberation and of a\nbrighter future for female artists\nisn\u2019t a false promise.\nOverall the unique perspectives\nand original creativity of each\nshowcased artist, taken together\nwith this mission, makes\nChampagne Life an empowering\nand inspirational exhibition.\nDefinitely not one to miss.\nChampagne Life is at the Saatchi\nGallery until 19th\nMarch.\nTickets from \u00a397\n\u201cBound\u201d, Alice Anderson.

Photo Credit: London Media\nUnsurprisingly, it appears\nprivilege is a key to success on\nthe silver screen. In an interview\nwith the Radio Times, the actor\nand Lannister poster boy Charles\nDance came out saying that\nstate educated actors have fewer\nopportunities than those from the\nare a rarity.\nBut do not rush to judgement. For\nthe few who make it, it is talent and\ntraining that get them there. For\nmany the training comes at drama\nschool and part of this is having\nexposure and guidance to life on the\nstage. I went to a private sixth form\nand I can tell you that the drama\nexperience is staggering. A former\ndirector in residence at Eton, our\nhead of drama had worked for the\nand on. Despite making up 7% of\nthe general population,the privately\neducated are crammed in at the\nhigher echelons of theatre and film.\nIn a sense it\u2019s self-fulfilling. A\ncareer as an actor remains one where\nthe right contacts and the right\nagent are invaluable. As a nobody,\naudition after audition dominates\nyour day to day with rare success,\nbut past a certain level the top jobs\nare just handed out \u2013 newcomers\nNational Theatre, the Liverpool\nEveryman, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe\nand trained in direction at RADA.\nWhether you like it or not, that\ninfluence and experience has a\nremarkable effect on a young actor.\nMy experience at the NationalYouth\nTheatre pales into insignificance\nwhen compared with the skill and\nbudget offered by the top private\nschools. No training before or after\nthat has taught me as much and I\nimagine the same influenced many\nof today\u2019s actors. Talented or not,\nactors from the top private schools\nare backed by an unrivalled support\nand training network that simply\nisn\u2019t available to the less privileged.\nYet that still doesn\u2019t justify the\nhuge gap at the top. Life as an actor\nActors from\nthe top private\nschools are\nbacked by\nan unrivalled\nsupport\nand training\nnetwork\nprivate sector. What a revelation!\nSo many of the big names have the\nbadge of privilege. That\u2019s not to say\nsome aren\u2019t great actors, but still,\n44% of people in TV, film or music\nare privately educated, I wonder \u2013\nwhy the disparity?\nIn his interview, Dance highlights\nEddie Redmayne and Dominic\nWest as actors whose Eton\nbackground give them an extra\ncharm and confidence to hit the\nstage - but there are many more.\nHenry Cavill, Carey Mulligan,\nTom Hiddleston, Helena Bonham\nCarter, Ben Cumberbatch, Hugh\nLaurie,Emily Blunt\u2026I could go on\nis competitive and for the 2% who\nmake a living from it, there is whole\nlot of hardship on the way there. If\nyou can\u2019t afford to stick to it and wait\nfor your break, you\u2019ll never make\na career out of it. As long as the\nprivileged can pay their way through\nthe years of unsustainable London\nlife, the disparity will continue.\nMore needs to be done to close the\ngap and make a career in acting\npossible to the underprivileged, but\nin the current anti-arts climate, that\nwon\u2019t be happening soon.\n44% of\npeople in TV,\nfilm or music\nare privately\neducated\nWe\u2019ve heard you were a victim.\nStop crouching in shadows, chewing your hair.\nYou can be graceful, not like a ballerina,\nlike a hedge of coral,\nBuilt up and eaten and worn down\nyet alive, carving the rhythms of the seas.\nYou can be a threshing sledge,\nnew and sharp with many teeth.\nJeannine Hall Gailey, \u201cOkay, Ophelia\u201d\nSexism in the arts doesn\u2019t make for a pretty picture\nChronic under-representation of female artists across the world is robbing us of great artwork\nI\nf you\u2019re thinking that a whole\nexhibition devoted to women\nis a an unreasonable amount\nof positieve discrimination,\nconsider how many shows in the\nSaatchi Gallery have featured\njust men. There are no prizes for\nguessing it\u2019s more than one in 30\nyears.\nSexism is endemic in the art\nworld; of the top art institutions\nin Westminster and the City of\nLondon, out of 386 public works of\nart; only 8% are created by women.\nOnly 31% of artists represented by\nLondon galleries are women despite\n72% of students studying Art in\nLondon being female.\nThe Guerrilla Girls, rather\ndamningly, in their series Do Women\nSTILL Have to be Naked to Get\nInto the Met. Museum? found that\nin 2011, less than 4% of the artists\nfeatured in the Art section of the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art in\nNew York were women, but 76%\nof the nudes are female. In fact,\nthe proportion of artists seems\nto have actually declined from\nthe 5% representing every female\nartist in 1984. Nothing else quite\nso eloquently points out even now;\nwomen are seen first as objects,\nfigures to pose rather than human\nbeings with things to say and ideas\nto share.\nChronic under-representation\nfeeds into the arts market; in 2014\nArtnet.com counted just five women\nin the top 100 living artists based on\nsales from 2011 to 2014. Passion,\nnot money matters to most artists,\nbut the gender pay gap means that\nwomen are less likely to afford to\ncontinue being full time artists.\nChampagne Life has created\nsomething of a trap for itself by\nbeing a one-off exhibition. It risks\nbecoming a gimmick that will\nbe over by Spring, a token salute\nto these women who have been\nbundled together for no other\ngood reason than they share an\nXX karyotype. These blockbuster\none-offs should be celebrated, but\nshould be recognized as merely the\nfirst step in achieving real change.\nThe end of the exhibition should\nnot mean a return to the status quo\nfor the Saatchi and the rest of the\nart world.\nUntil fair representation is\nachieved in the top galleries year\nround, it will be us, the public,\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nBlockbuster\nshows should\ngo further\nto promote\nequality in the\narts\nthat will be missing out on all the\nfantastic art we could\u2019ve enjoyed had\nthe art world got its act together.\n\u201cDo women have to be naked to get into the Met.

Isn\u2019t that crazy?\nOn the other hand, after\nhaving lustfully gulped down\nsomeone\u2019s career, there\u2019s something\ndisgustingly pointless about it all.\nSomething pretty disturbing \u2013 in\na dark old world \u2013 that we\u2019d waste\nsuch a glut of care on icecream.\nWho ever built higher, fought\nThe current\ncarefully\n\u2018authentic\u2019\nROH\nproduction\nabsolutely\ndemolishes\nVerdi\u2019s\nintent to\nchallenge\nharder, changed more - for love of\nan ice-cream?\nOr, to quote my wise old\nGrandma, is opera just \u201call fur coat\nand no knickers.\u201d?\nLa Traviata, billed as \u201ceverything\nthat opera should be about\u201d ...\u201dan\nintense workout of your love and\nfear muscles\u201d, seemed the best\nopportunity to settle the question.\nThe plot revolves around the\nstruggles of a Parisian courtesan\nVioletta, (Venera Gimadieva,\ndebut) and her (forbidden) love\nfor a nobleman, Alfredo Germont\n(Samuel Sakker).\nVioletta\u2019s slow decline and\neventual death from consumption\n(tuberculosis) forms the crux of\nthe play, while Alfredo\u2019s family do\neverything possible to prevent the\nunion of the happy couple.\nThat plot has undeniably faded.\nThe 19th\ncentury social mores of\nmarriage and chastity that Verdi\nrebelled against are long broken. It\ntook thirty years for Verdi\u2019s opera to\nbe performed in it\u2019s original form.\nSo, (as much as Traviata is a\nstaple) it seems deeply ironic that\nthe current,very carefully\u2018authentic\u2019,\nform of the ROH\u2019s production\nabsolutely demolishes the author\u2019s\nbasic intent to challenge.

After a quick\nwarm up, the game was underway.\nAfter an early try by Reading, not\ndisheartened, the team pulled\ntogether and managed to score two\ntries in the first half.\nThe first by Charlotte, in a show\nof pure strength and determination,\npushed through the opposing line\nand the second was from Elizabeth\nin an equally mighty battle to the\nline.\nImperial got a very lucky break\nwhen, having broken free of\nopponents, a Reading player failed\nto put down the ball on the touch\nline and ran it into the dead zone!\nBut this was only a slight let up and\nunfortunately the speed of Reading\nwas too much at times and they\nbroke through the Imperial team,\npushing them further into the lead.\nAll in all the first half showed\nsome very good rugby,with Imperial\nwinning scrums and turning over in\nrucks.\nAt the half time team talk, spirits\nwere lifted and the team were eager\nto pull back some points. However,\nthe hard pitch (nearly frozen) made\nthis an even harder task.The second\nhalf was a story of tackling, with\nsome amazing tackles being landed\nby everyone, especially Lizzie, Pip\nand Freya.The rucking ability of the\nImperial team was far superior to\nReading\u2019s, with a large proportion\nof tackles ending up in a turnover.\nUnfortunately, the second half\nalso led to some injuries, notably\nthe Captain\u2019s cracked rib, meaning\nthat Reading\u2019s speedy number\ntwelve managed to slip through the\ndefensive line, scoring more tries.\nThe Imperial team thought they\nhad a lucky break when, due to\ninjury, Reading\u2019s top try scorer\n(of this match), was subbed off.\nHowever, the lack of recent training\nwas starting to show as the team\ntired towards the end, and couldn\u2019t\nquite get any points back.\nThe final score was 65-10\nto Reading. But it was not a\ndisheartening game, with many\nof the girls playing a stormer of\na match, and having the bruises\nto prove it, it was a very good\nbenchmark to start the season on.\nWell done girls!\nBack before the bruising.

His dedication\nto method-acting led him to,\nfor example, remain exclusively\nwheelchair-bound and spoon-fed\nthroughout filming of My Left\nFoot. However, with actors being\nthe weird bunch they are, there are\nplenty of other examples to look to:\nChoi Min-Sik\nOne story that has come out of\nLeonardo DiCaprio\u2019s role in The\nRevenant involves his eating of raw\nliver despite being a vegetarian.\nIn a similar vein, the Buddhist\nactor Choi Min-sik ate several\nlive octopuses for his role in the\nsuperb Oldboy, praying for each one\nbeforehand. In the film, each year of\nprotagonist Dae-su\u2019s confinement\nwas marked by hot wire as a tally on\nthe skin. This marking, along with\nthe weight fluctuations that came\nwith confinement, was not faked.\nHilary Swank\nThe 1999 film Boys Don\u2019t Cry\nportrays the life of Brandon Teena,\na transgender man murdered in\n1993. Hilary Swank was cast and,\nfor over a month before shooting,\nlived her life as a man. Introducing\nherself as her brother to friends\nand neighbours Swank covered her\nbreasts, stuffed her underwear, cut\nher hair short and spoke in a low\ntone in her dedication to the act.\nChristian Bale\nChristian Bale is well-known for\nhis extreme weight fluctuations.The\nmost famous example was in the\nmid-2000s, when he nearly halved\nhis weight by eating one apple and\ntin of tuna a day to play skeletal\nTrevor Reznik in The Machinist\nbefore gaining back 109lbs of\nmuscle for the first of the Dark\nKnight Trilogy. In the past few days\nBale abandoned his role as Enzo\nFerrari for health concerns. Good to\nsee he has limits, I suppose.\nBEN COLLIER\nWinners and losers in this year\u2019s\nOscar nominations\nL\nast week saw the\nannouncement of the\nnominations for the 88th\nAcademy Awards, quite\npossibly the event of the cinematic\ncalendar. In a perfunctory ceremony,\nheaded by Ang Lee and Guillermo\ndel Toro, the names were rattled off\nin quick succession, leaving plenty\nof time for the following deluge of\ncritical analysis of the list. So how\nis the ceremony shaping up for this\nyear?\nAlejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rratu\u2019s frontier\nrevenge-epic The Revenant leads\nthe pack, with twelve nominations,\nincluding Best Picture, Best\nDirector, Best Actor, and Best\nSupporting Actor. If the Golden\nGlobes and Critics\u2019 Choice Awards\nare anything to go by, this year\nwill see the Best Actor award go\nto Leonardo DiCaprio, whose\nnomination for The Revenant is his\nfifth for acting. However, a large\nnumber of nominations does not\nnecessarily transform into actual\nsuccess; one only needs to look back\nto two years ago, when David O.\nRussell\u2019s American Hustle, which led\nthe pack with ten nominations,went\nhome empty-handed. One thing we\ncan near-guarantee, however, is that\nsomeone will flub I\u00f1\u00e1rratu\u2019s name\n\u2013 here\u2019s hoping for a repeat of John\nTravolta\u2019s infamous \u2018Adele Dazeem\u2019\nincident.\nTailing just behind The Revenant\nsuggestion that no black artists are\ngood enough to be nominated that\nis more upsetting. Idris Elba, whose\nterrifying turn as a commander\nleading a group of child soldiers\nin Beasts of No Nation earned him\nnominations for a BAFTA, Golden\nGlobe, and a Screen Actors Guild\nAward,was snubbed by the academy.\nSimilarly, Will Smith\u2019s turn in\nsports drama Concussion, which saw\na Golden Globe nomination, was\nignored.\nThe latest in the Rocky saga,\nCreed, saw Sylvester Stallone earn\na nomination for Best Supporting\nActor, but no nomination for its\nblack director Ryan Coogler, nor\nits black lead Michael B. Jordan.\nSimilarly, Straight Outta Compton,\nthe N.W.A. biopic that became the\nhighest grossing film with a black\ndirector, only received a nomination\nfor its four screenwriters, all of\nwhom are white.\nWith many seeing this as an\nindication of racial bias on the\npart of the Academy, high profile\nnames like Spike Lee and Jada\nPinkett Smith both announcing\ntheir intention to boycott the\nceremony. It comes as a bit of\nan embarrassment to Academy\npresident Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the\nfirst African-American to be elected\nto the position, who has been vocal\nin her criticism of the Academy\u2019s\nlack of diversity. Despite removing\nthe membership cap, and recruiting\n400 younger members, as the last\ncouple of years have shown, things\nare not improving. In a statement\non Twitter last week, she said that\nshe was \u2018heartbroken and frustrated\nabout the lack of inclusion\u2019, and\nacknowledged that \u2018change is not\ncoming as fast as we would like\u2019.She\nhas announced that she will launch\nan investigation into the Academy,\nwith the likely outcome of changing\nthe membership structure to better\nrepresent the film-going public.\nAnd this change is long-overdue.\nA study in the L.A. Times from\nlast year found that the Academy\nmembership is 77% male, and 92%\nCaucasian, with black members\nmaking up only 2% of the Academy.\nFurthermore, the average age of\nmembers is 62, with people younger\nthan 50 making up only 14% of the\nmembership. With such a growing\ndivide between the Academy\nmembership and the movie-going public, a rearrangement of\nmembership is much-needed.\nBut the problems with diversity\ndon\u2019t just stop there: Todd Hayne\u2019s\nravishing masterpiece Carol, which\ngarnered rave reviews across the\nboard, was noted by its lack of\ninclusion in the Best Picture and\nBest Director nominees. Many\nsaw this as a direct snub; the fact\nthat Carol was nominated for\nAcademy Awards for its acting,\nis George Miller\u2019s Mad Max: Fury\nRoad, which has ten nominations.\nWhile the Academy has never been\nknown to shy away from populist\ncinema, their recommendations\ntend towards the bland (The King\u2019s\nSpeech, anybody?) therefore, it is\nrefreshing to see them nominate\na film that has been undoubtedly\nboth wildly popular, and completely\noff-the-wall. The fact that its\nnominations include both Best\nPicture and Best Director are\nperhaps signs that the Academy is\nbeginning to embrace maximalist\ncinema, as demonstrated by Miller\u2019s\nbonkers blockbuster. Ridley Scott\u2019s\nThe Martian, essentially a vessel\nfor Matt Damon\u2019s acting chops,\ngarnered seven nominations, and\nrecent success at other ceremonies\nmeans it could be one to watch on\nthe night.\nHowever, a large number\nof cinema-goers were left\ndisappointed, after this ceremony\nacted as a sequel to last year\u2019s\n#OscarsSoWhite debacle, where\nAva DuVernay\u2019s Selma was by-and-large shut out of nominations. Like\nlast year, all twenty nominees for\nacting awards are white, prompting\nmany commentators to question the\nprocess behind the awards, calling\nfor a greater diversity in the makeup\nof the Academy. While many of the\nperformances nominated this year\nhave been worthy of awards, it is the\nDocumentary corner: Nas:Time is Illmatic\nBen Collier\nWriter\nI\nn 1994, Nasir \u201cNas\u201d Jones\nreleased his debut studio\nalbum Illmatic. The record\nquickly became a classic of\nhip-hop music, and one of the most\ninfluential albums of all time. Many\npeople consider this album, myself\nincluded, to be one of the best, hiphop or otherwise, ever produced.\nNME magazine at the time\ndescribed it as \u2018rhythmic perfection,\u2019\nand in retrospect many discuss it\nalongside 36 chambers, Ready to Die,\nThe Chronic, and My Beautiful Dark\nTwisted Fantasy.Nas:Time is Illmatic\nprovides a context for the album,\nexpanding on the topics covered\nin its lyrics (from drug culture to\npoverty) and narrating the early\nlife of Nas. One may expect this\ndocumentary to exclusively feature\nboasting and the kind of raving I\nhave just shamelessly demonstrated,\nleading to a bland puff piece, but\nthis is far from the truth. In reality\nwe are treated to an intimate look\ninto Nas\u2019 life and influences. We\nsee Nas grow up in the projects\nof Queensbridge as the son of\na Jazz singer and postal worker,\nexperiencing the uglier sides of life\nall in a film lovingly, professionally,\nand subtly assembled.\nTwo key moments in the film\ninclude the leaving of Nas\u2019 father\nand the death of his best friend\nWillie Graham, who was shot\nfollowing a fight. This second\nexample was an incident that also\nscarred Nas\u2019 brother Jabari both\nphysically and emotionally. It is\ninteresting to occasionally look\nbeyond the bravado of Jabari in\nparticular and see a man who is\ndeeply scarred, even repeatedly\nbegging his mother to move as the\nlocation of the shooting haunted\nhim. This culminates to show how\nclose Nas came to succumbing to\nthe life that many of his friends\ndid. A particularly poignant part\nof the film features Jabari looking\nat a picture included in the album\u2019s\nart of a group of Nas\u2019 peers and\nneighbours. Jabari explains how\neach person featured is either in\njail, between sentences, or dead.The\ntrue bleakness of the future faced\nby many black youths at the time\nstrikes hard here, and is emphasised\nby Princeton professor Dr. Cornel\nWest, who elaborates on the life\nof the average working class black\nfamily in the US at that time.\nThefinalsectionsofthefilmclosely\nfollows the rise of Nas as a teenager\nmaking music and the development\nof his famed lyricism. One criticism\nhere is that the very short running\ntime doesn\u2019t allow for exploration to\nquite the level I would have liked in\nsome cases. However, what the film\ndoes do right is portray the genre of\nhip-hop as one that is essential to\ncommunities such as Queensbridge,\nand provide a refreshingly mature\nview of the artistry,social awareness,\nand poetic lyricism that rap music\ncan achieve.\nNas poses with his friends and neighbours for Illmatic\u2019s album artwork. Photo Credit: Danny Clinch\ncinematography, script, costume,\nand score should have near-guaranteed its inclusion in the\nBest Picture category. Something\nseems wrong, and my personal\nhunch is that the Academy still\nhas a deep problem with films\nthat aren\u2019t catering to a straight\naudience. Carol is a film about two\nlesbians that doesn\u2019t veer off into\ntragic territory, and offers a chance\nof a happy ending; it was adapted\nby a lesbian, from a book written\nby a lesbian, and directed by a gay\nman. It seems the Academy hasn\u2019t\nmoved on much from 2004, when\nthe mediocre Crash won out over\nthe far superior Brokeback Mountain\n(a decision even Crash\u2019s director\nhas questioned). The decision this\nyear to include the straight-friendly\ntrans narrative of The Danish Girl\nover the wildly liberating Tangerine\njust reinforces this idea that the\nAcademy are hostile to LGBTQ\ncinema.\nAnother snub was Sarah Gavron\u2019s\nobvious Oscar-bait Suffragette. I\nfinished my review of it (back in\nOctober) with the line \u2018it will win a\nlot of Oscars,\u2019and I now happily eat\nmy words.\nHowever, it\u2019s not all doom and\ngloom with the nominations. One\nof the most surprising outcomes in\nthis year\u2019s awards was the growing\nrecognition outlets like Netflix are\ngetting for shaping the cinematic\nmarket. While their original\nproduction Beasts of No Nation\nfailed to gain any nominations, two\nof the Best Documentary nominees,\nWhat Happened, Ms. Simone? and\nWinter on Fire, were distributed on\nthe online streaming programme.\nWhile this perhaps only reflects\nthe openness of the documentary\nbranch of the Academy, it seems\ninevitable that online streaming\nservices will go on to change the\nfuture of cinema, just as they\nrevolutionised television culture.\nPerhaps the final word should go\nto the most pleasantly surprising\nnomination: veteran British actor\nCharlotte Rampling, who has\nbeen nominated for her chillingly\npowerful role in Andrew Haigh\u2019s\nlong-awaited, critically-acclaimed\ndrama 45 Years, which focuses\non a married couple who have to\nendure a shock to their relationship.\nRampling\u2019s performance is simply\nstunning in it, and \u2013 after the\nAcademy\u2019s long-running tradition\nof refusing to recognise art-house\ntalent \u2013 I am relieved that she is\nrecognised for her work. She has\nalready won awards for Best Actress\nat the Berlin Film Festival, and the\nEuropean Film Awards; after the\nperformance was snubbed by the\nBAFTAs, who nominated 45 Years\nfor only a single award, it\u2019s good to\nknow that the world hasn\u2019t gone\ncomplete mad.\nFRED FYLES\nThere is a\ngrowing\ndivide\nbetween the\nAcademy\nand the\npublic\nMale, pale, and stale?

The NHS is\nexpected to shave off \u00a320bn in costs\nby 2021, schools are preparing for\n16% cuts over the next three years,\nand controversial plans to reduce\nworking tax credits have been in\nthe public eye recently. Despite\nthere being some overly optimistic\nmurmurs of an end to austerity,\nit\u2019s looking unlikely that George\nOsborne is going to start splashing\nthe cash any time soon. It\u2019s a sticky\nsituation that, supposedly, we\u2019re all\nin together.\nBut guess who\u2019s still balling?\nThat\u2019s right, the old baked bean and\nco.are seemingly unaffected by UK\u2019s\nfinancial state.\nFor at least two years, there will\nbe no cuts to the royal budget. In\nfact the taxpayer funded income\nfor the royals will actually rise to as\nmuch as \u00a344 million (due to repairs\nneeded for the palaces), before the\nroyals will have to face reductions\nto funding. This is on top of the\nQueen\u2019s private income from the\ninherited estates, land owned, and\nthe crown estate.\nAlthough this money doesn\u2019t\nhugely impact the taxpayer, with the\ncost per person coming to just 56p\neach \u2013 quite good value, considering\nwe reap the vast benefits of the royal\nloving tourists \u2013 there is an issue. By\nnot scrutinising the royal budget,\nand even allowing it to rise, they\nare sending out the message that\nthe royals will never have to make\nthe same sacrifices as the rest of the\npopulation. While we\u2019re all feeling\nthe effects, old Lizzy and Phil carry\non livin\u2019 it large.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the main\nfigureheads that are smooth sailing\nthrough austerity.

Instead, that money will be\nspent on tarting up Buckingham\nPalace\u2019s interior and reupholstering\nthe corgis\u2019 baskets.\nThe whole notion of this is not\nonly uninspiring for the public, it\nundermines the government\u2019s harsh\nand increasingly unpopular tactics\nfor getting the country back in\nshape.The issue is enhanced because\nnow there really isn\u2019t any reason why\ntaxpayer\u2019s money should continue\nfunding the royals\u2019 ever expanding\nbudget. The royal family has next\nto no power anymore. No one is\ngoing to be thrown in the stocks for\nopposing the rise to their budget,\nand therefore it seems ridiculous\nthat we should have to keep paying\nout.\nUltimately it\u2019s time for the royal\nfamily to start budgeting and getting\nby on their own.

Photo Credit: Sarah Barlondo\nC\nhampagneLifeisnotyour\naverage contemporary art\nexhibition, but the first\nof its kind in Saatchi\nGallery\u2019s history. Not only is it\nstaged to mark the Gallery\u2019s 30th\nanniversary, but it is also Saatchi\u2019s\nfirst major all-female exhibition.\nThe brochure claims the title itself\nmakes an ironical statement about\nthe illusory glamour of an artist\u2019s\nlife.Hopefully that is the true reason\nbehind the title, and not the fact\nthat the exhibition\u2019s main sponsor is\nthe champagne Pommery \u2026\nIt is difficult to think of any\nappropriate title for the exhibition\nas the artistic purposes and\nmaterials vary extensively. Though\nthe variation between the artists\nis greater than any commonalities,\nI felt that each artist succeeds\nin effectively and impressively\nconveying her own individual\nmessage. This is definitely an\nexhibition which will leave you with\na lasting and transformative impact\nwell after your visit.\nThe exhibition consists of the\nworks of 14 emerging international\nwomen artists, providing 14 unique\nreflections on the meaning of being\na female artist today. Each artist\u2019s\npurpose is honest, and this purpose\nconveyed through their works in\na most creative, unexpected, and\noriginal way.\nSome of the works make\nstatements about the current\ndigital age and media culture. For\nexample, in the first gallery, we\ninstantly recognize the subjects of\n\u201cChampagne Life\u201d \u2013 repetitions of\ninverted Kim and Kanye painted\nover with a green or yellow. The\nfact that this unifying recognition\nphenomenon is experienced by\nall the viewers of the work, the\nability of Julia Wachtel\u2019s work to\ndemonstrate and expose this almost\nsubconscious new \u2018instinct\u2019 created\nby celebrity pop culture and the\nInternet is truly incredible.\nMaria Angeletti\u2019s works in\ngallery 6 also focus on the digital\nand Internet age, but specifically\non its influence on artistic practice.\nEach trio of her works is composed \u201cJermenac\u201d, Jelena Bulajic. Photo Credit: Sarah Barlondo\nJulia Dault\u2019s\nsculptures\nbear\nmarks and\nscratches\nthat expose\nthe act of\nthe work\u2019s\ncreation\nChampagne Life makes history by being the only exhibition in the gallery to feature just women\nof images that seem juxtaposed,\nbut in fact may appear together in\na Google search. The images are\nreproduced extensively in various\nways and spliced together, leaving\nus to contemplate whether these\nprocesses of contemporary image\nculture distance the image from the\nsubject, or uncover a new profound\nmeaning in it. Contrastingly,Sigrid\nHolmwood\u2019s paintings illuminate\na forgotten Swedish traditional\nlife. The Impressionist style of the\nartworks and the nineteenth century\nsubjects contrasts against the\npsychedelic neon colours in which\nthey are done. The fluorescence\nseems to put a vivid spotlight on\nthe vanished traditions, or perhaps\nrevives them with a new, refreshed\nlife.\nUnconventionally, some works\nin the exhibition make statements\nabout themselves. They act as\nmediums to expose the act of\ncreation \u2013 a contemplation and\nan exposure of the methods\nundertaken by the artist to create\nthe work. In gallery 6, Julia Dault\u2019s\nsculptures bear marks and scratches\nthat resulted from the artist bending\nand assembling the work, and thus\nunmask the presence of the artist in\nthe work. The imprints left on the\nPlexiglass hint at an unbreakable\nbond between the creator and her\ncreation, and these imprints also\nseem to give the cold industrial\nmaterial a touch of human warmth,\nalmost a sort of secret intimacy.\nSimilarly, Alice Anderson\u2019s \u2018181\nkilometers\u2019 bears testament to the\nmeditative and intensely physical\nprocess undertaken by the artist to\ncreate the work.\nThe works in gallery 4 bear\nan existential essence. On the\nwalls are Jelena Bulajic\u2019s works\n- each a portrait of a person she\u2019s\nencountered who\u2019s caught her\nattention in some way.\nThree of the portraits are so\nlarge they almost fill a whole wall,\nand the effect created by an aged\nface in extremely accurate detail\nis absolutely transfixing. Not\nonly are humans psychologically\npredisposed to be drawn to faces,\nthe process of aging is inevitable\nfor all.Tapping into these two facts,\nBulajic\u2019s portraits evoke a feeling of\nempathy and of a haunting unity,\nand the monumental size and detail\nof the portraits make them even\nfurther powerfully mesmerizing.\nIn the middle of gallery is the\nsculpture \u201cEchou\u00e9 au seuil de la\nraison\u201d by Virgile Ittah.The flesh of\ntwo bodies made of wax and\nseeming to melt conveys Ittah\u2019s\npurpose in this work - to study the\n\u201cfrailty and transience of human\nflesh\u201d.Thefactthatthebodiesalmost\nhang in suspension further invites\nMoje Sabz by Soheila Sokhanvari. Photo: Ben Pruchnie/Getty Images\nus to reflect upon this transience\nbetween being and nothingness.The\nfigures seem to reach for each other,\nand this perhaps adds the subtle\nmetaphor of this inevitable part of\nthe human condition as unifying.\nSeung Ah Paik\u2019s floor to ceiling\ndrawings in gallery 8 are depictions\nof her own flesh down to the most\nunflattering details. Exposing the\nimperfections of her own flesh\non a large scale is an unapologetic\nstatement of honesty \u2013 of not only\naccepting but celebrating flaws as\nreflections of one\u2019s individuality and\nidentity.\nHer work aims to show a self-accepting take on beauty that\ncontrasts the current societal\nobsession with illusory perfection.\nThe soft muted tones and technique\nPaik used seem to further contrast\nthe digital and sharply focused\nimages of perfect bodies in the\nmedia that women are constantly\nbombarded with.Personally,I found\nPaik\u2019s works to evoke a feeling of\ntenderness in response to the way in\nwhich she depicts the female body\nthat is empowering and inspiring.\nWhile Paik\u2019s works focus on the\nphysical aspect of female identity,\nMequitta Ahuja\u2019s paintings in\nGallery 7 convey her take on the\nintangible aspects of identity. Being\nethereal, these facets of identity can\nthus be presumed to be unfixed,\nand Ahuja\u2019s works aims to convey\na similar concept \u2013 that identity\nis not static, but ours to fabricate.\nHer paintings show figures\n(often self-portraits) woven into\na mythological or ancient setting.\nPersonally, I felt the work \u201cStick\n\u201cTwo Cows, 2013\u201d, Stephanie Quayla. Photo: courtesy of the Saatchi Gallery, London.\nBulajic\u2019s\ntransfixing\nportraits\nevoke a\nsense of\nhaunting\nunity\nStack\u201d clearly conveys this concept.\nThe feeling of an ancient tradition\nevoked by the earth-toned mosaic\n\u2013 an ancient and traditional art \u2013\ncontrasts strikingly to the body that\nis depicted in the same traditional\nstyle but is coloured bright blue.\nThe mosaic can be interpreted as a\nmetaphor for using bits and pieces\nof tradition, culture, and the past\nto reimagine these boundaries and\nto create out of them a unique\nidentity. Moreover, the blue skin is\na symbol clearly demonstrating the\nability to create a personal identity\ndespite seemingly unchangeable\nLet\u2019s\nhope this\npromise of\na brighter\nfuture for\nfemale\nartists isn\u2019t\nfalse\n\n"

Nominated for\ntwelve Oscars, it\u2019s\nlooking like this might\nbe the one that bags it for Leo,\nand goddamn, will he have earned\nit. Anyone who has read anything\nabout director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s new frontier survival epic\nwill know that everything about\nthe film\u2019s production was a feat of\nsuperhuman effort and endurance.\nFrom freezing temperatures to\nminiscule daylight hours, the fact\nthat this film exists at all is testament\nto the will of the cast and crew to\nmake something worthy of the story\nthat inspired it. I\u2019m happy to report\nthat this effort was not in vain.\nSet in the wilderness of\n1823 Montana and based on\nthe events surrounding Hugh\nGlass (Leonardo DiCaprio) \u2013 a\nlegendary frontiersman and fur\ntrapper \u2013 The Revenant is a study\nin grim determination. It begins\nwith Glass\u2019s fur trapping party\nbeing ambushed by native Arikara\nwarriors, which leaves most of the\nmen dead. The survivors, including\ncantankerous half-scalped trapper\nThomas Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy),\ndecide to head overland to the\nnearest settlement. Shortly\nafterwards,Glass surprises a mother\nbear with her cubs, and is viciously\nmauled. Severely injured, Glass is\nleft to either recover or die with\nhis half Native-American son\nHawk, Fitzgerald, and na\u00efve young\ntrapper Jim Bridger (Will Poulter).\nFitzgerald kills Hawk, and tricks\nBridger into abandoning Glass,\nleaving him alone and weaponless in\nthe wilderness with hostile natives\npursuing.What follows is one of the\ngreatest survival tales of all time and\na 200-mile odyssey to seek revenge\non the man who killed his son and\nleft him for dead.\nFromtheoff,youknowwhatyou\u2019re\nin for. The ambush occurs within\nthe first fifteen minutes and by\nthen about twenty people have died\nonscreen, many of them extremely\ngraphically: arrows through throats;\nshots through chests; axes through\nskulls.No,this film doesn\u2019t spare you\nthe gory reality of frontier living at\nall. However, while the vast amount\nof violence will be in itself a turnoff\nfor some, it is beautifully done. The\nshocking immediacy of the deaths\nis acutely felt, as opposed to grunts\ndropping like flies, Rambo-style, in\na cartoony Wilhelm-scream-esque\ndeath.\nThe famous bear-attack is another\npointofartfulviolenceandsomehow\ntops the previous ballet of suffering.\nIn my opinion DiCaprio deserves\nan Oscar simply for the toe-curling,\nbutt-clenching screams of pain\nand waves of facial contortion he\nproduces during the scene. Serious\ncredit must also go to whoever\nproduced the bear (one of the only\nconcessions to CGI in the whole\nfilm) which I\u2019m sure will stand the\ntest of time as an example of CGI\ndone right. One particular moment\nthat highlights the director\u2019s\ncommitment to convincing us of\nhis film\u2019s reality is when the bear\u2019s\nheaving breath fogs up the lens of\nthe camera, making you feel like\nDiCaprio is really being savaged by\na true tank of an animal.\nAs you will probably have noticed,\nsuffering is quite the theme running\nthrough this film from start to\nfinish. While this is masterfully\ndone, viewers looking for a film\nwith more emotional heft may want\nto look elsewhere, as there\u2019s not\nreally much emotion on show other\nthan vengeance, fear, and varying\nlevels of pain and survival instinct.\nWhat drives the film and keeps you\nengaged for the whole (admittedly\nrather long) 156-minute runtime is\nseeing what Glass will survive next.\nSuch adversities include sub-zero\ntemperatures, starvation, gangrene,\nand frozen rivers, with your overall\nopinion of the movie mostly being\nLeonardo DiCaprio, thinking about all the awards he\u2019s going to win for his portrayal of Hugh Glass in The Revenant. Photo Credit: 20th Century Fox\nThomas Carroll\nWriter\nThe\nRevenant\ndoesn\u2019t\nspare you\nthe gory\nreality of\nfrontier life\nEndurance is everything in The Revenant\nIf I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s frontier survival epic doesn\u2019t net Leo that Oscar, nothing will\nshaped by whether you\u2019re invested\nenough to see him pull through\nanother punishing situation.\nDiCaprio isn\u2019t the only hook\nin this film though, with Tom\nHardy and Will Poulter putting in\nconvincing performances in their\nown right. The cinematography\nof Emmanuel Lubezki is another\ndraw, with beautifully constructed\nshots and long \u2018how-did-they-dothat\u2019 single take sequences showing\noff serious filmmaking prowess.\nThe entire film is aided in its\nauthenticity and onscreen intensity\nby the fact that it was simply so\nbloody hard to make. Treacherous\nweather conditions and sub-zero\ntemperatures meant that actors were\nconstantly fighting off hypothermia,\nand I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s insistence on using\nonly natural lighting for shots\nlimited filming time to a few hours\na day. Every scene was meticulously\nrehearsed, and the effort shows in\nthe final product.\nThe Revenant is a visceral venture\ninto a cold hell of life and death,and\n\u2013 in the age of blockbuster sequels\n\u2013 one of the most original films to\nhave come out in a long while. A\ngamble that seems to have paid off,I\ncan only hope the film and its actors\nget the recognition they deserve.\nR\noom is a story of\nkidnapping, survival and,\nultimately, hope. The two\nlead performances by Brie\nLarson and Jacob Tremblay give the\nfilm heartbreaking depth, but this is\nhindered by a wobbly narrative.\nThe film follows a mother known\nonly as Ma, played by Larson, and\nher five-year-old son, Jack, played\nby Tremblay, as they live their life\nas captives in a shed. At the start,\nMa has been held captive for seven\nyears, meaning Jack has lived his\nentire life in what they call \u2018Room\u2019.\nTo make it bearable, Ma has told\nJack that Room is the entire world,\nthat beyond it is only space, and\nbeyond that is \u2018TV world\u2019. What\nfollows is their attempt at escape \u2013\nbut even if they manage it, can they\nhandle living in the world beyond\nRoom?\nConsidering the large amount of\ntime spent in such a small room,\nnot once did the film feel closed\nin. Director Lenny Abrahamson\nsomehow created the feeling of\na wide expanse that beautifully\nmirrors the incredible world that\nMa had created for Jack. But is this\nworld really beneficial for him in\nthe long run? By telling him this\nstory, will it make it harder to come\nto terms with the real world upon\ntheir escape? The film delves into\nquestions like this one, sometimes\nanswering them, other times\nThe Revenant\nDir: Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu Script:\nAlejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Mark\nL. Smith Starring: Leonardo\nDiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall\nGleeson, Will Poulter. 156 minutes.\nRoom\nDir: Lenny Abrahamson Script:\nEmma Donoghue Starring: Brie\nLarson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen,\nSean Bridgers. 117 minutes.\nCreed\nDir: Ryan Coogler Script: Ryan\nCoogler,Aaron Covington Starring:\nMichael B. Jordan, Sylvester\nStallone, Tessa Thompson 133\nminutes.\nO\nnce in a while, the\npairing of an actor\nand a role appears so\nperfect that it eclipses\nthe possibility of that actor ever\ntruly being separated from their\ncharacter: Hugh Jackman will\nalways be Wolverine despite his\ncontinually-expanding performance\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Robert Downey Jr.\nquite simply is Tony Stark. One of\nthe earliest and best examples of\nsuch a pairing is Sylvester Stallone\nand his humble-beginnings boxing\nchamp Rocky Balboa, a character so\niconic and well-loved that it\u2019s quite\nhard to remember exactly when you\nfirst heard about the Rocky saga,\nalthough you\u2019re certain it was quite\nsome time ago.\nStallone\u2019s Rocky now returns to\nthe silver screen for a seventh time\nin Creed, although not quite taking\ncentre stage \u2013 the story instead\nis based on Adonis (Michael B.\nJordan), the son of Rocky\u2019s old\nrival and friend Apollo Creed, who\nrejects the easy life anointed by his\nfather\u2019s financial success and instead\nhungers to become a boxer himself.\nIn search of proper guidance,\nAdonis tracks down Balboa in the\ndusky backstreets of Philadelphia \u2013\nthe same setting of all the previous\nRocky movies \u2013 and asks for his\ntraining.It may not sound massively\noriginal, but this is a sports drama \u2013\nwhat would you expect?\nExcept it\u2019s not just a sports drama.\nIn the vein of the best of the Rocky\nfilms,Creed uses its visceral sporting\naction as a thrilling backdrop to a\nhuman drama that is perhaps even\nmore engaging than its counterpart.\nWhile the poignancy of Adonis\u2019\nfightforsuccessissomewhatblunted\nby the silver-spoon upbringing he\nreceived, it is made up for by the\nfilm\u2019s powerful exploration of the\nthemes of family, passion \u2013 the real\nbattle is not for a mere title, but for\nAdonis\u2019 very identity.\nThe performances, as is common\nin sports drama, bolster the film\nwith their authenticity \u2013 Michael\nB. Jordan has worked with director\nRyan Coogler previously on the\nacclaimed Fruitvale Station, and\nit\u2019s clear that the professional\nrelationship between them is a\nstrong one; while the films don\u2019t\noverlap much thematically, the\npalpable power that possessed\nJordan\u2019s portrayal of Oscar Grant\nin Fruitvale Station courses through\nthe blood in Adonis Creed\u2019s veins.\nWhile Jordan remains an arresting\nand immediate central presence\nthroughout, and a likeable new\nhero to carry the saga forward for\na new generation, it is in fact the\nold guard Stallone who steals the\nshow \u2013 that legendarily winning\ncombination of actor and role rings\ntrue once again. As an audience we\nfully believe that although age is\ncatching up with Rocky \u2013 a moving\nscene in which he visits the graves\nof some old friends is a highlight\n\u2013 he is still undeniably Rocky:\nquietly passionate, a little goofy,\nand ultimately heart-wrenchingly\nlovable. His performance is truly\nexcellent; I\u2019ll sleep well if Stallone\ncarries home this year\u2019s Best\nSupporting Actor Oscar (as it\u2019s\nlargely suspected he will).\nIt\u2019s not often that a truly\nworthwhile reboot comes along, but\nthis may well be the most engaging\none in years. Creed makes up for its\nlack of originality with a good story,\ntold well by a talented cast \u2013 with\nsome brilliantly-done fight scenes\nto boot.\nTOM STEPHENS\nCreed may\nwell be\nthe most\nengaging,\nworthwhile\nreboot to\ncome along\nin years\nintentionally refusing to.\nAt only eight years old, Tremblay\ngives a performance anyone would\nbe proud to call their greatest work.\nIt\u2019s a real shame that he was mostly\nignored for award nominations;\nit must be difficult for anyone to\nplay someone whose entire world is\ncompletely changed so convincingly,\nlet alone a child. Watch out for this\nkid, he could likely grow up to be\none of his generation\u2019s finest actors.\nLarson succeeds in creating\na character who is terrified and\nbroken underneath whilst trying\nto appear strong and happy for\nher son, going from motherly to\nangry to desperate in the blink of\nan eye \u2013 an emotionally exhausting\nperformance.\nAlthough Room has many great\naspects to it, it isn\u2019t perfect: the\nfirst half of the film is intense and\nemotional, and at one point I could\neven feel my heart thudding heavily;\nbut all too quickly, the narrative of\nthe film turns into a semi-incoherent\nmess. While all the individual\nscenes in the second half are well\nmade, they don\u2019t always fit together\nnaturally. At one point, a character\nis introduced, and a plot develops\naround them, but before anything\ncan happen the character disappears\nforever, without seeming to really\naffect anyone.This, along with other\nparts, means that the empathy I\nfelt for Ma, built up so well in the\nfirst half, began to slip away as the\nfilm progresses \u2013 definitely not the\nintended effect.\nRoom is a difficult film to watch;\nit\u2019s a dark and tragic story, but the\nhope that remains throughout is\nenough to make it watchable until\nthe end.\nALEX HEIB\nJacob Trembley and Brie Larson give staggering performances in Lenny Abrahamson\u2019s Room.

Photo Credit: BBC\nO\nn Tuesday, Labour\u2019s\nattempt to reverse the\ngovernment\u2019s decision\nto scrap maintenance\ngrants was foiled.\nFrom September 2016, students\nwill only be able to access means-tested loans, which they will have\nto pay back once earning over the\n\u00a321,000 salary threshold.\nAt the moment around 500,000\nstudents in England are given\nmeans-tested grants to cover living\ncosts which don\u2019t need to be paid\nback. This equates to an increase of\n\u00a33500 of debt per year for students\nfrom the lowest income households,\nalongside their \u00a39000 academic fees.\nMany worry that this will put\noff bright students from poorer\nbackgrounds from attending\nuniversity at all, given the threat of\nsuch a financial burden.The average\nhome student who started a degree\nin 2012 or later will leave university\nwith about \u00a350,000\u2019s worth of debt.\nRepresentatives from the National\nCampaign Against Fees and Cuts\nwere outside parliament awaiting\nthe decision, and when the news\nbroke that maintenance grants were\nto be scrapped, students \u2018occupied\u2019\nWestminster bridge.\nWith signs, reading \u2018NO\nGRANTS = NO BRIDGE\u2019,\nthe protesters managed to block\nthe main thoroughfare from\nWestminster to Waterloo for an\nhour and a half, before police\nsuccessfully moved them along.\nGeorge Osborne has also been\naccused of using the changes as\na political trick, one in which the\ncosts of the current student grants\nare passed onto the government 30\nyears down the line. This is due to\nthe expenditure only being counted\nwhen the student loans are written\noff and not, as is the case now, when\nthe grants are first given out.\nOsborne\u2019s use of this loophole\nallows him on paper to make huge\nstrides towards \u201cbalancing the\nbooks by the end of this parliament\u201d\ndespite just prolonging the cost.\nStrong criticism was also voiced over\nthe way the government enacted\nthese changes, doing so without a\nfull commons debate via the process\nof a \u201cStatutory Instrument\u201d.\nThis type of bill is usually used for\nlow-key policy change, not large-scale overhauls, and meant that\na committee of just 18 MPs (10\nCON, 6 LAB, 2 SNP) voted after\nhaving a debate of just 90 minutes.\nThe final vote, 10-8, meant that\nthe last resort of reversing the\ndecision now lies with the House\nof Lords, where a motion has been\ncalled for in order to annul the\nchanges. It was a Lords vote that\noverturned Osborne\u2019s controversial\ntax credit cuts late last year.\nMATT JOHNSTON &\nGRACE RAHMAN\nNew financial threshold for non-EU students\nYou could be deported unless you earn \u00a335,000 after graduation\nT\nhis week pressure has\nbeen growing on Home\nSecretary, Theresa May,\nto abandon plans to\ndeport non-EU immigrants who\nare earning less than \u00a335,000 a year\nafter 5 years of living in the UK.\nThe average UK-wide salary is\nfar lower than this threshold, at\n\u00a320,800 and a figure on the college\u2019s\nwebsite put the average leavers\u2019\nsalary across subjects in 2013 at\nImperial at \u00a329,232.\nA petition calling for the plans\nto be scrapped has reached 78,000\nsignatures,with large concentrations\nof signatures from London, but\nalso from university towns like\nBristol, Oxford, Cambridge and\nBrighton. Joshua Harbord, who\nset up the petition, said the policy\n\u201cunfairly discriminates against\ncharity workers, nurses, students\nand others\u201d.\nAlistair Carmichael, the Liberal\nDemocrat home affairs spokesman,\nalso argued the point that the\narbitrary level \u201cfails to take talent\nand new sectors like tech start-ups,\nwhose staff might be paid less than\n\u00a335,000\u201d\nPetitions on the government\u2019s\nwebsite are guaranteed a response\nonce they reach more than 10,000\nsignatures, but as seen on Monday\nwith the petition to ban Donald\nTrump, they need 100,000\nsignatures to be considered for\ndebate in parliament.\nAfter an outcry when these plans\nwere first announced in 2011,\nseveral jobs were excluded from\nthis threshold. These include PhDs,\nlecturers and nurses. There are also\nsome specific engineering jobs (such\nas in the oil and gas industry) that\nare on the government\u2019s \u201cShortage\nOccupation List\u201d, whose entry\nlevel salaries are usually below the\nproposed threshold, but would be\nexempt.\nProposals have also been made\nthat would mean UK companies\ncan\u2019t bring in skilled workers from\noutside the EU, unless they are paid\na starting salary of \u00a330,000 as well\nas paying a levy of \u00a31,000 per year\nfor every non-EU hiring.\nThe plans unveiled in 2011 were\nalways planned for introduction in\nApril 2016, and are seen as a way\nfor David Cameron to reduce net\nimmigration from 250,000 to a\nnumber \u201cin the tens of thousands\u201d.\nGRACE RAHMAN \u201cYou have to be earning this much to stay\u201d.

The\nprotagonist, Max Caulfield, one day\nacquires the ability to manipulate\ntime and alter the fabric of reality.\nMax and her childhood friend\nChloe Price embark on exciting\nadventures, taking advantage of\n(and even sometimes abusing)\nMax\u2019s new found power. However,\nthe story quickly evolves from a\nheart-warming tale about the newly\nrenewed friendship of two teenage\ngirls to the horror of an impending\nhurricane and subsequent fate of\ntheir town.\nThe heroine Max Caulfield (played\nby Hannah Telle) is a seemingly\naverage teenage girl. Armed with a\ncamera and creativity, she attends\nthe prestigious Blackwell Academy\nin the hopes of pursuing a future\ncareer in photography. Despite her\nnatural talent,her lack of confidence\nkeeps her in the shadows of her\npeers. She is completely contrasted\nby Chloe Price (Ashly Burch) who\nis a recalcitrant spirit with electric\nblue hair.The tag team combination\nof a timid character and a rebellious\none is not uncommon in teenage\ncoming of age stories, because\nit works. Life Is Strange is no\nexception to this. There is also an\nintriguing ensemble of secondary\ncharacters, from filthy rich brats\nto the wholesome and innocent. It\nBut first, let me take a selfie.

Photo Credit: Dotnod Entertainment\nreally is just like high school.\nThe game allows the player\nto rewind the vast majority of\nevents, with each triggering\nconsequences that cascade onto\nother consequences (The Butterfly\nEffect for those familiar with\nChaos Theory). A decision that\nthe player makes in episode one\nmight not have visible effects until\nepisode four, leading to moments\nof dramatic realisation. The choices\nthat the player can make are vast;\nranging from choosing between\nhaving a bacon omelette or Belgian\nwaffle for breakfast to whether\nor not they steal money from the\nhandicapped fund. There are several\n\u2018points of no return\u2019 throughout the\nstory at which the option to reverse\ntime is removed, forcing the player\nto really think carefully about their\nchoices. Due to this, there is an ever\npresent feeling of trepidation. At\nthe end of each episode, worldwide\nstatistics are revealed that show how\npeople made their choices \u2013 one\nof the game\u2019s many quirks. Who\nwouldn\u2019t be curious to see what\npercentage of people made the same\nchoices as you?\nEvery game features \u2018filler\u2019\nmoments that contribute little to\nthe overarching storyline, instead\nexisting solely to prolong it. In\nthe case of Life Is Strange, there\nare several mini-games which are\ngenerallyentertainingyetsometimes\nmildly annoying. Among these,\nin the third episode there is a part\nthat warrants furiously mashing the\nkeyboard in an attempt to solve a\nseemingly randomly and extremely\nfrustrating puzzle. After finally\nsucceeding one hopes to never have\nto go through that ordeal again\nonly to find out eventually that\nthe exact same puzzle will feature\nno less than five times in the fifth\nepisode. Moreover, the game is not\nwithout its fair share of glitches and\ngraphical imperfections. The speech\nvaguely follows the movement\nof the characters\u2019 mouths at best,\nnevertheless one still cannot help\nbut be impressed by the intricate\nartwork. Another feature of Life Is\nStrange that deserves praise is the\nsoundtrack; the indie instrumental\ntunes, featuring musical talents such\nas Foals and Syd Matters, keep the\nplayer thoroughly engrossed in the\ngameplay.\nLife Is Strange is a triumph in\nterms of storyline. There is much to\nbe desired in terms of smoothness of\ngameplay, but this is a minor defect.\nThe ending is poignant and thought\nprovoking. Although the storyline\ntakes place over only five days, the\ncharacters feel eerily familiar by the\nend.\nLife Is Strange is a must play\nfor those who are interested in\npoint and click adventure games.\nIts episodic nature is perfect for\nallowing yourself an acceptable\namount of procrastination one\nevening, but proceed with caution \u2013\nit is entirely possible that you could\nend up bingeing the entire five\nepisodes in one sitting.\nLife Is Strange is available now\non all major platforms\nThere is\nan ever\npresent\nfeeling of\ntrepidation\nLife Is\nStrange is\ntriumph\nin terms of\nstoryline\n\n"

The public\nhealth charity Action on Smoking\nand Health estimate that of the 2.6\nmillion people using e-cigarettes,\n1.1 million are ex-smokers, with\nincrease of e-cig users between 2014\nand 2015 being almost entirely from\nex-smokers.\nHowever, the University of\nSan Francisco has released data\nshowing that e-cigarettes are not\nactually as effective as believed\nwhen it comes to stopping smoking.\nFindings published in The Lancet\nRespiratory Medicine show that\nusing e-cigarettes to aid attempts\nto quit smoking actually has the\nopposite effect. The researchers\nin San Francisco collected and\nMadeleine Webb\nWriter\ntrials, as well as a range of age\ndemographics, number of previous\nquitting attempts and nicotine\ndependence.\nThe researchers also presented\na possible reason that e-cigarettes\nare ineffective when used to help\nquitters; in this case, the cause\ncan be found in the e-smoker\u2019s\npsychology. The drop in the use\nof traditional cigarettes over the\nlast 50 years is generally attributed\nto the introduction of policies to\ndiscourage smoking. Warnings\non packaging, increased taxation\nand the ban on indoor smoking in\npublic places, have made smoking\nmore inconvenient and corroded its\n\u201ccool\u201d image. However, e-cigarettes,\nwhile regulated, are largely free of\nthe same stigma and are considered\nto be less harmful. The paper states\nthat \u201cThe inclusion of e-cigarettes\nin smoke-free laws and voluntary\nsmoke-free policies could help\ndecrease use of e-cigarettes as a\ncigarette substitute, and, perhaps,\nincrease their effectiveness for\nsmoking cessation.\u201d\nRight now very few of the current\nsmoking laws apply to e-cigarettes,\nallowing the devices to be used as a\ncrutch for smokers rather than tools\nthat enable quitting. \u201cThe irony is\nthat quitting smoking is one of the\nA\nll the festive meals and\ndrinks plaguing the\nholiday period, often\nhave a substantial effect\non our post holiday figure. Sure,\nwe make New Year\u2019s resolutions to\nhit the gym and become fitter, but\nhow many of us still struggle to\nfit into that pair of skinny jeans?\nWell, if you\u2019re still finding your\njeans a bit too snug post Christmas,\nyou can probably hold your genes\nresponsible for it.\nA research team of biologists\nat Heidelberg University gained\nnew insight into how our feeding\nbehaviour is encoded in our genes.\nThe team led by Prof. Dr. Lohmann\nof the Centre for Organismal\nStudies (COS), studied the\nmodel fruit fly (D. melanogaster),\nand looked at the function of a\nparticular developmental gene\nwhich belongs to the Hox gene\nfamily. Hox genes are responsible\nfor controlling the development\nof an embryo along the head-tail\naxis. In a sense, the Hox genes\ncould be described as the body's\n'architect' which is responsible for\nthe physiological blueprint of an\norganism. However, this new study\nrevealed that a particular gene in the\nHox family, known as \u2018Deformed\u2019,\nplays a crucial role in controlling\nour feeding behaviour. This specific\ngene is responsible for establishing\nthe feeding motor unit during the\ndevelopment of the embryo.\nA glimpse into the genetics of overeating\nWhy vaping will not help you quit smoking\nWhy quit smoking when you can look THIS cool?

Studies\nincluded both practical and clinical\nA coastal approach to the plastic problem\nImperial College research suggests we should change our clean up methods\nW\nhen we think of\nplastic pollution\nin our oceans, it\u2019s\ncommon for our\nfirst thoughts to be of a poor turtle\nsquished within a tight plastic ring,\nor of the infamous Great Pacific\nGarbage Patch - a massive swirling\nvortex of plastic bags, bottle caps,\nfibres from synthetic clothing, and\nso on, found smack in the middle of\nthe Pacific Ocean.\nEstimated at over 100 million\ntonnes and twice the size of the\nentire United Kingdom, most of the\nplastic in the patch has been broken\ndown into microscopic pieces \u2013\nmicroplastics \u2013 that can persist for\nhundreds, if not thousands of years,\ncontinuing to poison and kill ocean\nand avian wildlife indiscriminately.\nThe toxins in the plastics also\nenter the earth\u2019s food chain when\ningested by animals, passing the\ndangerous chemicals continually\nthrough our planet\u2019s food webs\nand ecosystems. A recent analysis\nby Imperial College\u2019s Dr. Erik van\nSebille and colleagues in Australia\nshowed that more than 90 per cent\nof seabirds have swallowed plastics.\nTo date, much of the research\nfocus on ocean plastic pollution has\nbeen on how to clean up this Great\nPacific Garbage Patch and others\nthat exist in almost every ocean in\nthe world. There are well-meaning\ninitiatives like The Ocean Cleanup \u2013\nNaomi Stewart\nWriter\nOcean plastics can pile up in important areas for animal conservation. Photo Credit: Forest and Kimm Starr\nwhich is based in the Netherlands \u2013\nthat aim to deploy plastic collectors\nat these environmentally toxic sites\nto directly clean up and remove the\npollution from the ocean.\nHowever, newly published\nresearch from The Grantham\nInstitute\u2019s Dr. van Sebille and\nundergraduate physics student\nPeter Sherman actually shows that\nit might be more efficient to focus\non cleaning up at the point of entry\nfor pollution. That is, it\u2019s better to\nset up plastic collectors directly at\ncoastlines where plastic garbage is\nbeing washed out, not out in the\noceans where it\u2019s already being\nbroken down into toxic chemicals\nand waste.\n\u201cThere is a lot of plastic in the\npatch, but it\u2019s a relative dead zone\nfor life compared with the richness\naround the coasts,\u201d said Sherman.\nThe birds analysed in the earlier\nstudy by Dr. van Sebille are also\nconcentrated around coasts where\ntheir food is plentiful.\nThe new study by Dr. van Sebille\nand Sherman, released just this\nTuesday in Environmental Research\nLetters, shows how the researchers\nstudied the movement of plastics in\nthe ocean to figure out where was\nbest to deploy plastic collectors and\nprevent the most harm to wildlife\nand ecosystems.\nModelling a ten year project\nstarting in 2015, they found that\nplastic collectors placed at strategic\nentry points along coastlines\nwould remove over 30% of the\nmicroplastics, as opposed to the\n17% removal rate if collectors\nwere placed at the garbage patches\nthemselves. This proposed system\nof floating barriers and platforms\nwould concentrate, collect, and\nremove plastics flowing into the\nocean from urban rivers, sewers,\nand waste deposits before they even\nhad the chance to disperse into the\nA small garbage patch in the Pacific. Beautiful.

Most of it comes from\nlitter and debris on the land or in\nwaterways that eventually wash\nout to the ocean. In light of this,\nthe research from Imperial College\npointing out the greater efficiency\nand success in reducing plastic\npollution by ultimately stopping it\nat the coastal sources is even more\nrelevant and timely.\n\u201cWe need to clean up ocean\nplastics, and ultimately this should\nbe achieved by stopping the source of\npollution,\u201dsaid Sherman.\u201cHowever,\nthis will not happen overnight, so a\ntemporary solution is needed, and\nclean-up projects could be it, if they\nare done well.\u201d\nOver 80%\nof oceanic\ndebris\nactually\ncomes from\nland-based\nsources of\npollution\n\n"
