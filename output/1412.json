Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 24 October 2008 felix\nArts\nThe high price of living the dream\nKatie Clemence stays gripped through Australian playwright Andrew Upton\u2019s darkly comic play, Riflemind\nI\nt was a long time since I\u2019d been to\nthe theatre, so I remember feeling slightly wary as I idled in the\nfoyer of Trafalgar Studios before\nthe start of what I\u2019d just learned\nwas to be a play of two and a half hours.\nI hadn\u2019t had much sleep, so I hoped the\nshow would be exciting enough to keep\nme awake and gripped.\nThe show, directed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is set in modern times-it focuses on the relationships between\nthe members of a once-iconic band\n(Riflemind) attempting to get back together and go on tour. We\u2019ve all seen\nhow successful reunion tours can be,\nbut a highly-strung frontman, junkie\nbassist and broke drummer lead the\naudience to question whether it will\nreally work this time.\nThe play revolves around John, the\nlead guitarist. Having walked out on\nT\nhe new exhibition at the\nNG, Renaissance Faces,\nwas hailed as \u201csomething\ngood, rather than something lots of people will\nlike\u201d, a.k.a. an average variety of exceptional paintings. Most things at the NG\nare bound to be OK due to the incredible expert knowledge of each curator\nabout their field, which always leaks\nout in either the audio guide or the\nblurb by each painting: \u201cTo hear our\ncurator of Northern European Renaissance Female Forms tell you more\nabout her nipples, press the green\nbutton\u201d. All in all, you always tend to\nleave their exhibitions feeling that was\nmoney well spent, even though you\nhave no idea how you\u2019re going to use\nall those shiny, new postcards you just\nblew your budget on.\nI loathe the space they use for their\npaying exhibitions. The crypt-like\nSainsbury Wing basement is suitably\nneutral for any use but I really wish\nthey\u2019d use the main building for these\nthings, if only for the feel of some natural light and the elegant walls. However, the grey neutrality of the Sainsbury\nWing seems quite suitable for their\nRenaissance paintings as it mimics the\nblank religious homes most of them\nprobably occupied in their heyday.\nI enter the semi-Blockbuster Renaissance Faces with trepidation but\nsoon relax into paintings-mode with\nthe help of the soothing, Welsh tones\nof the nice lady talking on my audio\nguide. Audio guides are most definitely\nworth every penny if you do like learning about the art and stories behind\nthe paintings. The blurb is not enough\nand they hardly ever blurb about tech-nique, paint or history in depth. They\ncost \u00a33 for students, which works out\nas two hours of fun with some Renaissance music thrown in, too!\nFollowing the proper etiquette of\nexhibitions, Room 1 contains all the\noldest portraits of the Renaissance. In\n1400, people suddenly decided that\nthey wanted to be remembered for\nwho they were as individuals and not\nas generic workshop copies of a face.\nThe first portrait is a stunning profile\nof the daughter of Henry IV. It is in fantastic condition and has clearly been\nrestored or tidied up for display \u2013 the\nblue of her dress is rich and the gold\npattern is ornate and pure. She sports\na fashionably Renaissance hairstyle \u2013 a\nplucked hairline. Yes, girls: a receding\nhairline was all the rage!\nIn the 15th century before the full\nfrontal portrait became popularised,\na profile was the angle of choice. This\nwas not to hide the fugly side of your\nface, but this angle was said to be the\nmost memorable view of a person\nand showed how virtuous you were.\nThey were obviously emulating antiq-uity, like Roman coins etc. However,\nthey soon realised that was a load of\nbollocks and as you walk around the\nroom, you notice that the portrait are\ngradually turning to a full-frontal posi-tion. Clever curators!\nBellini\u2019s portrait of Doge Leonardo\nLoredon really turns your head in this\nfirst room. The Doge radiates power\nfrom his visage. The amazing lifelike features of his head show the advancement of technique with the use\nof paints. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a bit of a\npaint geek and it\u2019s fascinating to note\nthe change from tempura-based paint\nto oil paints. Oil paints dry much more\nslowly than tempura or egg-based\npaints so artists realised they could\nspend much longer manipulating the\ncolours and shapes on the canvas or\npanel. The resulting naturalistic works\nare fine in detail and much more interesting to look at.\nI\u2019m afraid to say I fell for a young man\nwhile I was at the gallery. The young\nman in question was painted by Botticelli and he was my favourite in the\nwhole exhibition. He seems so unremarkable at first but I ended up gazing\nat him for almost 15 minutes and had\nto keep coming back to him to see his\nself-assuredness and deep eyes. I was\nabsolutely captivated.\nOn entering the second room it was\nlike I was walking into a Renaissance\nhouse where everyone looks up from\ntheir tasks to see who\u2019s just come in. I\nfelt like I disturbed a couple of people\nreading as they glance up angrily from\ntheir books. These portraits seem far\nless posed even though they all were\nprobably sat for.\nThe faces in this room seem to have\nmore personality, perhaps due to the\nbetter use of light by painters. We also\nstart to notice another Renaissance\ntrait in these paintings \u2013 the use of\nsymbolism in vast quantities. Art Historians, have a field day! There is an\nunnamed lady in one painting. What is\nher name?\nWell, Margarita of course! Her dress\nis embroidered with daisies, she holds\na string of pearls and a pet dragon \u2013 all\nof which means Margarita or are synonymous with Saint Margarita. Another example of symbolism is shown\nobviously with \u201cMan holding skull and\na pansy\u201d. No, he does not want to kill\nall the Gays: he is meditating on death.\nThe skull means death and the pansy\nMine eyes have seen the glory\nRosie Grayburn is engrossed and enamoured at the NG\u2019s new exhibition, Renaissances Faces\n(or pens\u00e9e in French) means thought.\nMy favourite painting here was the\nportrait of Lady Anne Lovell by Holbein, one of my favourite artists. She\nlooks so modest but the portrait does\nshow her wealth very discreetly with\nher beautiful, expensive ermine hat. I\nlove Holbien\u2019s elegantly twirling leaves\nas a backdrop and the inclusion of her\npet squirrel eating an acorn. The lady\nwas identified partly because of clever\naddition of a starling to her picture.\nStarling is a play on words of the lady\u2019s\nancestral seat, East Harling. Clever,\neh?\nBy this time in the exhibition I have\nnoticed a lot of these paintings actually come from \u2018The National Gallery\nLondon\u2019. I am disappointed that they\nhave just been moved downstairs from\ntheir usual spots in the main gallery to\nform an exhibition with other works of\na similar genre. Is it just a cheap trick\nby the NG or a money-saving scheme\nin the midst of the threat of recession?\nEventually I decide to feel proud that\nso many of these lovely, lovely portraits\nbelong to us as a country (Insert National Anthem here). Also, I guess they\ndo make more sense when put into a\ncontext like this exhibition.\nRoom 3 highlights the use of portraiture in marriage negotiations and\ncourtship in 15th century Europe.\nFirstly, we see the Renaissance\u2019s perfect\nwife. Boys take note. She has blonde,\nlightly curling hair, pure, pale skin and\nshe holds an orange blossom in her\ndelicate hand symbolising chastity.\nThis portrait was obviously sent to the\nlady\u2019s hubby-to-be to tantalise his taste\nbuds. Phwoar.\nAs we know, Henry VIII also partook in these portrait courtships. He\nfound his 4th wife, Anne of Cleves this\nway \u2013 just like a Tudor dating agency.\nInterestingly he also sought out other\nprospective brides before he [wrong-ly] chose Anne \u2018take two\u2019. His court\npainter, Holbein, was sent to Brussels\nto paint the famously beautiful Christina of Denmark. At the age of 16 she\nhad been widowed already and Henry\nwas interested. In the portrait she is\ndressed full length in black and has a\nfoxy look in her eye. Fortunately for\nChristina the marriage negotiations\ncame to nothing, and Henry took Anne\nof Cleves instead.\nRoom 4 passes quickly although I\nenjoy learning about Jan van Eyck, of\nwhom everyone seems to have heard\nbut me.\nThere are several of his well-known\npaintings displayed here and you can\nappreciate his absurdly good technique\nand skill with paint. Right on cue, the\nNG pulls their expert on Northern European Renaissance paint out of the\nbag so they can tell us all about him on\nthe audio guide. I love van Eyck\u2019s self-portrait \u2013 he looks shrewd and cocky.\nHe knows how good he is and he wants\nthat to be preserved forever!\nYou will all recognise \u2018The Ugly\nWoman\u2019. This timeless portrait may\nbe a satire on lust or a cruel mocking\nof an ugly person in love. She clasps a\nrosebud next to her wrinkled cleavage,\noffering it to the man in the painting\nnext door. Funnily enough, she is the\nbest thing in Room 5, under the theme\n\u2018Love and Beauty\u2019. Everyone else here\nis boring and beautiful, modelled on\nMichelangelo\u2019s David or the ideal\nwoman.\nThe variety of drawings in the next\nroom keeps us interested as the exhibition draws to a close. There are fine\nHolbein sketches, a self portrait by\nPontormo (the 1st Calvin Klein model)\nin his underwear and a portrait of a\ncorpse. This may sound rather sinister but the artist has actually used his\ndeath sketch to make a portrait of the\nman with his doting grandson. The result brings the man back to life in a colourful and very sweet commemorative\npainting. Sniff.\nFor some reason, the last room of\nthe exhibition is dedicated to the ruling powers of the Renaissance: that is\nthe Church and the monarchs. It is a\nlittle demeaning after seeing all those\nwonderful portraits to be reminded\nabout who really was in charge of this\n\u2018rebirth\u2019 of the arts. Ah well, it is a nice\nthe band, causing the split, he arranges\na reunion for them in his decadent\ncountry house. He has starved himself\nof music for 6 years, choosing instead\nto lead a life of abstinence with his yo-ga-obsessed wife, Lynn.\nTheir delicate equilibrium is shat-tered, however, by the arrival of the\nband; old relationships are rekindled\nwhile John and Lynn are again tempted\nby the alcohol and drugs they swore to\nnever abuse again.\nJohn Hannah shines like a Scottish\nbeacon in the role of John, the moody,\nworld-weary protagonist, whilst Susan\nPrior emerges as a compelling character in her role as Lynn, the dutiful\nhousewife who gave up her days as a\nwild child to save her marriage.\nCritics described the play as \u201cdarkly\ncomic\u201d and \u201cexplosive\u201d, and I would be\ninclined to agree with them \u2013 the play\nboldly explores the dark secrets of human relationships, using suspense and\nintrigue to keep the audience wanting\nmore.\nOverall, if you are looking for a\nfrightening insight into the moments\nof desperation, insecurity and anxiety\nthat characterise the human race, coupled with awkward and at times bleak\nhumour, then Riflemind is right up\nyour alley.\nhistory lesson, and Phillip II of Spain\u2019s\n\u2018swagger portraits\u2019 do fit quite nicely in\nthe space. Also, this is the first room\nwhere we actually get to see some Titian portraits. I am unimpressed. Although his technique is clearly innova-tive, the colours aren\u2019t as rich as I like,\nnor are the features as fine. However,\nhis portrayal of Pope Paul III does get\nacross his unequivocal power. This guy\nis scary and must have been incredibly\nformidable in real life. Shiver.\nSo, in the Renaissance, for the first\ntime people wanted to be remembered\nas the unique person they were. This is\nclearly demonstrated in this exhibition\nwith the huge variety of people on display \u2013 it\u2019s like going to a fabulous party\nfull of witty, attractive people. There\nare Medici bankers, virtuous wives,\nbored and rich young men, Emperors\nand popes\u2026 In my opinion, Renaissance Faces is a blockbuster of an exhi-bition. I learnt so much and it is really\nquite magical being able to look into\nthese 500 year-old faces which are so\nwonderfully preserved.\nI wonder, in 500 years time when\nthere is a \u201821st century Faces\u2019 exhibition at the National Gallery, how will\nwe be remembered?\nRenaissance Faces is on until 18th\nJanuary. It costs \u00a310.50 with your\nstudent card and it is well worth\nthe money. Do it, do it now. What a pretty picture you drew. Bless.\nJohn Hannah, left, as John in Andrew Upton\u2019s new play Riflemind. Did the chap playing the guitar just fart? How terribly rude.\nIt\u2019s very difficult to decide which is more attractive. I\u2019m not too sure why we\u2019re deciding but I\u2019m going to go for the fruit.. delicious.\n\n"

As the main\nstrategy being used by College is waiting for other students in Imperial halls\nto drop out, the 5 undergraduate students now living together at Paragon\nare left in limbo and facing an uncertain future.\nAlthough listed as \u201cour award winning student accommodation\u201d on the\nThames Valley University website, felix\nhas been informed that Paragon is actually an inter-collegiate hall. Originally 23 students were destined to begin\nuniversity this TVU/intercollegiate hall\nmuch removed from the student popu-lace. From this group, 5 students failed\nto fill their place at Imperial. Hannah\nTheodorou, Deputy President Education and Welfare, and Head of Accommodation Shireen Brown, greeted the\nstudents that did arrive. They spoke\nto parents and tried to assuage their\nworries about their accommodation.\nAs a small recompense the students\nwere given free mingle tickets as well\nas a minibus back from the event. They\nhave also been participating in other\nhalls events such as the Southside boat\nparty and the Southwell trip to Bruges. Attempts to integrate the 1st year\nstudents with post-graduates at Clayponds were not received well. 32 inch\nHD-TVs were installed in the fresher\u2019s\nkitchens also.\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nfelix speaks to Paragon freshers who have been moved to other halls, and those who have been left behind\nHow did you end up at Paragon?\nFabrice Clark\nThe students are paying around \u00a3113\na week for a single, ensuite room in\nParagon. The students were presented\nwith a list of possible rooms in other\nhalls and were invited to choose which\nthey preferred. The recipients of the\nrooms were chosen by random ballot.\nSince the beginning of term, all of the\nfemale students at Paragon and 13 of\nthe male students have been relocated\nto Piccadilly Court, Orient, Southwell,\nPembridge, Southside and Wilson.\nThe remaining students are on the\nwaiting list for rooms in Imperial halls\nbut unless students drop out, there\nwon\u2019t be any openings. Hannah Theodorou said \u201cthe students are a priority\non the waiting lists for vacancies\u201d. Ironically, although 1st year students are\nhoping to be moved out of Paragon,\npostgraduates may soon be moving in.\nIn the mean time, Fabrice Clarke\nand the other students have only the\ncold comfort of knowing that the hour\ncommute each day is good training for\n2nd year.\nFabrice Clark\nHave college handled this well?\nDid you enjoy your time there?\nFabrice Clarke is a 1st year\nelectrical engineer student who is\nstill living at Paragon Hall.\n\u201cThe College should warn us in\nadvance that if we don\u2019t have offers\ninstead of letting us find out days\nbefore the start of term. \u201d\nHow did you end up at Paragon?\nHow did you end up at Paragon?\nCallum Macbeth-seath is a 1st\nyear electrical engineer student who\nnow lives in Piccadillly Court.\n\u201cThe College should make less offers\nnext year.\u201d\nAdam Cutmore is a 1st year\ncomputing student who now lives in\nKeogh Hall.\n\u201cWe should be kept up-to-date more\nabout the accommodation process\u201d\nI originally applied for South Kensington halls and I was given an offer. I\nwasn\u2019t told about the 7-day reply limit\nand so when I came back from holiday\nI realised that it had been withdrawn.\nIt was only days before the Mingle that\nI was offered a room at Paragon.\nIt was a strain travelling in the morning\nbut all the students at Paragon got on\nreally well together. We made friends\nwith each other easily and we got to go\nto other halls events. I didn\u2019t meet any\nTVU students, we had our own floor\nso we were kind of sectioned off.\nWhen we moved in the Head of Accommodation spoke to us all and explained the situation, which was good\nbut Hannah Theorodou has been really helpful. She made sure we were\nable to go to the Mingle and kept us\ninformed about what was going on.\nI missed the accommodation deadline\nbecause I was waiting for a re-mark.\nCollege didn\u2019t tell me that I didn\u2019t have\na room until near the end of September. I looked for a flat and I put a deposit down before I was offered Paragon, so I lost the deposit.\nAre you enjoying your time there?\nOriginally it was quite fun, there were\n20 of us and we were quite close. Now\nthere\u2019s only 5 of us left and the atmosphere is much different, we\u2019re just sort\nof waiting around now. It takes around\nan hour to get into college which is a\nbig inconvenience.\nHave college handled this well?\nThey went to a lot of trouble to keep\nus happy, giving us free tickets to the\nMingle and other stuff. It felt like we\nwere being pressured to move out of\nParagon. They allowed us to join in\nevents with other halls, although going to Clayponds was a bit weird.\nBasically, I didn\u2019t get my application\nin on time because I hadn\u2019t decided\nwhether or not to live at home. I took\nthe offer of a room at Paragon because\nI was hoping to be moved to another\nhall. I\u2019m pretty happy now that I\u2019m living in Southside.\nDid you enjoy your time there?\nIt was a really nice hall, it\u2019s only two\nyears old. I had a single, ensuite room\nwhich was great but it wasn\u2019t worth the\ndistance from campus. We were all really desperate to move into Imperial\nhalls and we were all very aware how\ntemporary it was.\nHave college handled this well?\nHannah Theodorou was really help-ful, she set up a meeting so that we\ncould choose which rooms we wanted to be moved for. I think the College have done a good job but I think\nthere is a problem with the application process, we need more info.\n\n"

bitch.\nAnd not in a good way.\nAfter much anticipation Imperial College Gaelic Football Club finally took\nthe field at our new pitch in Harlington\nin the first match of the season against\nUniversity of Bedfordshire. Having\nonly entered into the BUCS competition this year for the first time, both\nteams were in unfamiliar territory,\nboth however were determined to get\noff to a successful start. Bedford acquitted themselves better in the opening minutes making full use of their\noutrageously long warm up having arrived an hour and a half early for the\ngame. The IC defence was opened up\nall too easily and the opposition were\nrewarded with two soft goals in the\nearly exchanges.\nSeemingly this handed the impetus\nto IC and the team shook themselves\ninto action through the midfield duo\nof Finian McCann and Edward O\u2019Hare\nwho remained exemplary for the rest\nof the match. With the tactical switch\nof Jamie Sanders into the full back line\nthe tide started to turn. Time and again\nIC repelled the Bedford attack and began making inroads themselves. Frank\nO\u2019Neill opened our account, calmly\nturning to shoot over the bar from\nmiddle distance. O\u2019Neill again got on\nthe scoresheet minutes later with a\nwell taken goal after some superb fielding by O\u2019Hare who set the West Belfast man up on the right flank. Further\npoints from McCann and a speculative\nlong range effort from Andrew Lavery\nsaw IC play the more attractive football\nof the half, being much more clinical in\ntheir passing and finishing, though but\nstill suffering from the soft goals conceded earlier. Half time score 1-03 to\n2-05. (Bedford leading by five points.)\nThe second half saw more of battling\nfrom both teams. A lack of fitness was\nevident as both teams fatigued and the\nmoments of champagne football in the\nfirst half were not to be seen again.\nBedford players were cynical in their\ntackles and ironically their only reward was in injuring their centre half\nback who dislocated his shoulder and\nwas subbed off. The prick. Over the\nnext thirty minutes the match was to\nbe won and lost in the diamond region\naround midfield. Paddy the-brick-wall Heugh in centre half forward was\nsteadfast for the whole game expertly\ncatching several high balls and allowing the defensive partnership of Phil\nJakeman and Donnacha Kirk to clear\ntheir lines. Some frenetic attacking\nfrom both teams saw the full backs at\neither end under periods of intense\npressure, only the fine keeping from\nStan Sikorski denied Bedford all but\none of the further goals they were optimistically looking for, while at the\nother end the opposition keeper under\npressure from O\u2019Neill and Lavery was\nforced into conceding a penalty which\nO\u2019Neill stuck in the net. Ten minutes\nleft and all was to play for. Mattie Wilks\noffered many options to the IC attack\nin the closing quarter but the team\nfailed to convert their chances with\nthe same finesse as earlier in the game,\nonly managing another point through\nthe left boot of Edward O\u2019Hare. Full\ntime score 2-04 to 3-07.\nImperial lost out this time but there\nwere many positives to be taken from\nthe game and the team eagerly look\nforward to their next match against\nOxford this Sunday and the chance to\nrevenge themselves for last year\u2019s challenge match result. Training continues\nin Hyde Park Wednesday and Friday\nafternoons and if anyone is interested\nin joining or finding out more, email\nal306@ic.ac.uk. The club would also\nlike to thank Sport Imperial and it\u2019s\nstaff for their great support of and investment in the club in this its maiden\nseason.\nImperial College 4s...Ready for War!\nGaelic Football\nImperial Men\u2019s 2-04\nUni of Bedfordshire 3-07\nAndrew Lavery\nICUGFC successfully making use of the \u201c45\u201d set piece Football\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 0\nJames Skeen\nIC 4s V IC 5s has become the stuff\nof legends. The stats speak for them-selves, from IC4s point of view: Played\n6, Lost 6, not a single point scraped\nfrom this epic derby. For this reason\nthe 4s approached this game with\ncaution.\nThe 4s were already missing Chris\nNoone who decided to miss the game\nto pursue his 2 month heterosexual run\nand the infamous Dutch U21 Wayne\nVan Der Roo has still not turned up\nsince fresher\u2019s fair. The game was always going to be fiercely contested\nwith the reputation as the Wednesday\nULU flagship team up for grabs. Captain Jeremy \u201cJ-Lo\u201d Lovett rallied the\nteam aided by his trusty sidekick Gui\nwith some broken English, some about\nfootball, most about nothing. What did\ncome from the team talk was a strong\nstart with Marcus and Mike at centre\nhalf producing the kind of big tackle\nthat even Claude Makelele would be\nproud of. The game ebbed and flowed\nwith both teams sharing possession\nfor the first half. The 5s struggled to\ncontain Inty and James Long upfront,\nbut were bailed out by their man of the\nmatch, the ref. Gui rounded the keeper\nonly to be given offside which resulted\nin much flamboyant preying gestures\nand finger waving as Gui tried to vent\nhis fury with the referee. The 5s captain Ron then floored Jeremy with a\ntackle that those fellas with the odd\nshaped balls would be proud of only to\nbe let off without a caution. The injustice drove the 4s on and the reward\ncame with what can only be described\nas a stone-wall , 100% definite penalty\nwhich Inty neatly slotted away to give\nthe 4s a well deserved lead going into\nthe break.\nThe 4s recently have lacked the ability to kill a game off but that is exactly\nwhat was needed for the second half.\nlack of confidence, he faced his fears\nand scored the winning try. This monumental effort will no doubt fuel the\nego of the team for years to come.\nCaptain James Pettit collected the silver wear on behalf of IC which will be\nthe first of many more to come. Coach\nJoe Brown said \u201cThe lads put in a massive effort today. To come here and put\nin a performance like this is unreal.\nThey didn\u2019t let the 3 man disadvantage\nget to them. I\u2019d like to thank everyone that made this possible, including\nHugh Dingleberry, who sadly couldn\u2019t\nbe here today.\u201d\nSpecial mention must go to Mark\nSaleme who scored four tries throughout the day. Its good to see him getting\nback to his old ways, having to relearn\nthe game of rugby, after the unfortunate concussion he suffered two years\nago.\nThe swap of Captain Jeremy for continental Jeremy worked a treat and the\nteam took on a more attacking stance.\nIt was Jeremy who in fact bagged the\nsecond goal, riffling home a shot from\nwithin the penalty area to give the 4s\na much needed cushion. The third\ncame as Matty Spliff put in a bold challenge to get on the end of a dangerous\nAlex Childs through ball which then\nfell for James Long to clinically slot\nhome. The rest of the game was a formality with the 4s controlling possession and the final whistle brought jubilant celebrations and Captain Jeremy\nclearly Lov-d-ett.\nAt the end of the day the real winner was as the clich\u00e9 suggests, football.\nBoth teams look strong and should\nhave plenty of success in ULU 1 against\nother less physically attractive teams.\nThe football club is open to anyone\nwanting to be part of the ongoing success story which is IC Football and\nnewcomers are more than welcome to\njoin us on Monday evenings for training or Wednesday evenings for a responsible beer or ten.\nICURFC 1st XV travelled to Bristol\na week ago on Wednesday to play the\nUniversity of West England in the first\ngame of the season. With promotion\nto South Premiership B the boys were\nanxious yet excited to discover the\nstandard of teams they will be facing.\nThe day got off to a rocky start with\nthe coach failing to show up resulting\nin two players having to drive minibus-es. Arriving late, the team had just 45\nminutes on the pitch to warm up and\nshake off the long drive.\nImperial went out all guns blazing,\nputting a lot of pressure on the UWE\nattack and forcing some crucial errors.\nAfter an intense first ten minutes it became clear that this was a game Imperial were capable of winning.\nHowever, after conceding two sloppy\npenalties within kicking range UWE\nwent 6-0 up. Imperial kept a clear\nhead and stuck to their game plan.\nThere were some great line breaks in\nthe centres however IC struggled to\nturn territory into points. UWE went\non to score two tries making the half\ntime score 20-0.\nAfter some stern words from the\ncaptain and coach, Imperial went into\nthe second half determined to turn the\ndeficit. After some well structured forward play, fresher fly-half David Bowe\nspotted a gap on the blind side. Tom\nCarroll ran a good angle and went flying through a gap, catching the UWE\ndefence off guard. Carroll went on to\nbrush off the full back scoring Imperials first try of the season. Alexander\nJohnstone converted the try with an\nexcellent kick from the touchline making the score 20-7.\nIC carried on battling in the second half, producing some great rugby.\nHowever it was not to be their day.\nUWE managed to get deep into the IC\nhalf and made use of their heavy pack\nwith several pick and goes. Eventually,\nthey wore down the IC defence and\nmanaged to push over a try making the\nscore 27-7. Things were not looking\ngood for Imperial and with UWE scoring a fourth try a comeback seemed\nout of their grasp.\nIn the last few minutes, Imperial\nscored a consolation try with Joe Harris getting his first points for the 1st\nXV. The final score was 32-12 to UWE.\nMan of the match was awarded to Tom\nCarroll for his penetrative running and\nsolid defence. A special mention goes\nto freshers Charlie Esberger, David\nBowe, Sam Coe and Alex Cardyn for\ntheir impressive debuts.\nA disappointing result to start the\nnew season, but there are signs of great\nthings to come. This will hopefully\nimprove for next week\u2019s game against\nOxford Brookes.\nRugby\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 12\nUni of West England 1st 32\nTom Carroll\n\n"

Regarded as one\nof France\u2019s greatest popular singers,\nshe was able to bring tears to the eyes\nof many who could not understand a\nword of French.\nStanding only 4\u201910\u201d tall, the \u201cLittle\nSparrow\u201d was anything but in character and energy, living a hectic and\neventful life involving numerous boy-friends, husbands, car crashes, morphine addiction, being brought up in\na brothel, helping French prisoners\nescape Nazi persecution, colossal fame\nand extraordinary talent.\nMuch of her life remains mysterious\ndespite many written biographies, as\nwell as the film about her life, La Vie en\nRose, although the legend that she was\nborn on the pavement of the Rue de\nBelleville in Paris is most likely incor-rect! The Donmar Warehouse\u2019s production moves from its home in Covent Garden to the Vaudeville Theatre\nto continue its run of Pat Gem\u2019s Piaf,\nthirty years after its birth by the RSC\nin 1978.\nLasting ninety minutes with an absence of an interval, the play\u2019s pace is\nfast and was obviously written with the\nassumption that audiences had a good\nidea of the content of Piaf\u2019s life and\nstardom. Details and characters about\nthe singer\u2019s life, which ebb and flow out\nof the story at a startling rate (border-ing on being rushed) were often easy\nto overlook as we struggled to keep\nabreast of developments and names.\nFurther confusion was added as many\nof the actors adopted the role of several\npersons: was that her boyfriend/agent\nfrom before or a new one?? The choppy transitions between scenes were\nexecuted cleanly, morphing seamlessly\nbetween both moods and settings;\nPiaf\u2019s costume changes occurring onstage as the actors re-dressed her in\nand out of her trademark black dress,\nthe sparrow\u2019s diva streak letting it all\nensue around her.\nThe stunning talent of Elena Roger \u2013\nwith all the potency of a large, orotund\nopera singer, compacted into a feisty,\nfemale fireball \u2013 is the raison d\u2019etre\nof the show. Her depiction of Piaf is\nstunning, from the start as a loud-mouth, spitting, sluttish street urchin\nand throughout the play as she rises\nto fame increasing in self-importance,\nstill maintaining streaks of her humble\norigins and promiscuous ways, until\nthe end as the singer descends into\nfrailty, unhappiness and alcoholism as\ncancer consumes her.\nI had doubts about how French her\naccent sounded, thinking it was more\nItalian, but given Edith Piaf\u2019s mixed\nItalian and French heritage, it seemed\nfitting. A superb effort also came from\nD\nramsoc\u2019s opening salvo\nof the year is Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Importance of\nBeing Earnest, an 1895\ncomedy which is probably Wilde\u2019s best-known play.\nThe play opens with Algernon, an\naristocratic young Londoner, receiving his friend Ernest Worthing, whilst\nwaiting for a visit from his aunt, Lady\nBracknell. Ernest then professes his\nlove for Lady Bracknell\u2019s daughter\nGwendolen and states his desire to\nmarry her. Due to a cigarette case that\nhe left in Algernon\u2019s care, it unfolds\nthat Ernest is actually Jack Worthing,\nand has created the Ernest persona so\nhe can come on jaunts into London\nfrom the country. As he says, \u2018I\u2019m Ernest in Town and Jack in the country\u2019.\nDespite Lady Bracknell\u2019s objections,\nJack proposes to Gwendolen, planning\nto kill off the Ernest persona should\nshe agree. But she blows that notion\nout of the water with the line \u201cthe moment Algernon mentioned that he had\na friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love him\u201d. She is determined to\nmarry him, regardless of her mother\u2019s\nwishes, as long as his name is Ernest.\nAt this point the real thrust of the\nplay kicks in, as a case of mistaken\nidentity ensues, with Algernon going\nto the country pretending to be Ernest,\nwhile Jack starts to spread the news\nthat Ernest is dead. Algy (or Ernest)\nsoon meets and falls for Cecily, Jack\u2019s\n(or Ernest\u2019s) impressionable young\nward, and wants to marry her. She is\nas keen to marry him \u2013 as long as his\nname is really Ernest. To revive a well-worn theatrical cliche, hilarity ensues.\nThe well-rounded cast really get into\ntheir roles and it was obvious everyone\nenjoyed putting the play on. Some of\nthe dialogue zings back and forth and\nthe cleverness of Wilde\u2019s writing really\ncomes to the fore.\nThebestlinesoftheplayundoubtedly\nfall to Lady Bracknell (Rebecca Jones).\nAn example of this are the words to\nher daughter: \u201cwhen you do become\nengaged, I or your father, should his\nhealth permit, will inform you of the\nfact. An engagement should come on a\nyoung girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant as the case may be. It is hardly\na matter that she should be allowed to\narrange for herself.\u201d\nThere is much more in a similar vein\n\u2013 you could fill a book with the lines\nshe utters - and indeed, Wilde has.\nBrilliantly made to embody all of the\nsocial hypocrisies of the period, Lady\nBracknell is one of those towering\ncharacters that chews up the spotlight\nwhenever on stage (most memorably\nplayed on screen by the late Dame\nEdith Evans, and in the last screen adaptation by Dame Judi Dench. If she\nwasn\u2019t on stage for such a short time,\nthe rest of the characters would live\nin her shadow, and the play picks up\nconsiderably when she bursts in for\nthe first time. Rebecca Jones\u2019 performance is the most stylised in the play\nand the clipped tones that she speaks\nin make everyone in the audience feel\nas chastised as one of Lady Bracknell\u2019s\nsubordinates.\nThe other performances are good,\nand a lightness of touch required for\nsuch a romp pervades the whole pro-duction. Special mention must go to\nGilead Amit who played Jack Worthing, who has the sometimes thankless task of being the straight man,\npermitting the farce to unfold around\nhim, especially in relation to Jan Szafranski (Algernon) whose performance\n\u201cThe stunning\ntalent of\nElena Roger\ncompacted into\na feisty, female\nfireball\u201d\nThe Little Sparrow takes flight\nthe hair and make-up team who managed to age Piaf very well with some\nconvincing wigs.\nLorraine Bruce as Piaf\u2019s \u201cpartner\nin mischief\u201d, Toine, gave a very funny\nperformance helped no doubt by her\nbulky frame, boisterous mannerisms\nand loud cockney accent albeit rather\nodd given the Parisien setting. The\nCaz Knight keeps warm with some scintillating vocals, courtesy of a new biopic of the great Edith Piaf\nsexual chemistry between Rogers and\nPhilip Browne, who took the part of\nboxer Marcel Cerdan - the true love of\nPiaf\u2019s life, was electric and stood out\ndespite a short scene between the two.\nEdith and Marlene Dietrich (played by\nKatherine Kingsley) share an onstage\nkiss which will go down well with any\nheterosexual males and girls will be\npleased to see two taut, sculpted, shirtless boxers fighting in the ring.\nRoger\u2019s voice contains all the force\nrequired to chill the audience in a similar way that Piaf would have done and\nretains the singer\u2019s warbling vibrato\nsound which seals the play with the\nmuch loved and anticipated \u2018Je ne Regrette Rien\u2019, which merited the standing applause it received.\nThe show is a real treat and those\nwho hate musicals need not worry:\nthis is more of a play-cum-concert\nwith none of the abhorrent choreographed dance routines, group singing\nand ghastly scores which plague many\nWest End venues, only beautiful renditions of Piaf\u2019s music.\nDramSoc\u2019s first show of the year\nsometimes flies perilously close to car-icature. The Algernon/Jack interaction\nis central to the play working, and the\nwork of Amit and Szafranski keeps the\nplay ticking over nicely.\nAnd now for the criticism: the first\nact takes a while to get going, and the\ncast don\u2019t seem to truly believe the coincidences that lead to the inevitably\nhappy ending. There\u2019s a bit too much\n\u2018nudge, nudge, wink, wink\u2019 going on\nhere. It\u2019s not giving anything away to\nsay that a few people get married, but\nat some points the casts look embarrassed for that to be the case. From a\ntechnical standpoint, good use is made\nof the three location set, including an\ninterval set-change that will leave those\npaying attention wondering \u201cHow did\nthey do that?\u201d. Plus there is some set-dressing that will have you wondering\nif there are any plants missing around\ncollege.\nAs an introduction to Wilde, this\nproduction works really well, and\nthose who are conversant with the\nplaywright will be pleasantly surprised.\nThe most appropriate adjective for this\nplay is \u2018feel-good\u2019. People will leave\nwith a smile on their faces, and if this\nis a taster, it bodes well for the other\nproductions that Dramsoc has planned\nfor this year.\nDramsoc\u2019s Production of \u2018The Importance of Being Earnest\u2019 has two\nmore performances, Friday 24th and\nSaturday 25th of October. 7pm, Union Concert Hall.\nTosin Ajayi casts an expert eye over the first performance of DramSoc\u2019s \u2018The Importance of Being Earnest\u2019\nIt\u2019s hard deciding whether to drink with sophistication from the glass or to throw restrain to the wind and chug from the bottle\nDirector: Kristen Farebrother\nProducer: Pietro Franchi\nCast list:\nJohn Worthing, J.P Gilead Amit\nAlgernon Moncrieff Ziggi\nSzafranski\nHon.

I\u2019m not\nthat pedantic and shall not be following Coren\u2019s lead. However even if no\none cares or spotted the mistakes, I\nneed to clarify the situation for, if for\nno one else, myself.\nFor the first time this year I\u2019ve decided to bring back the Cool/Lame Wall,\nbut it has been rebranded for no other\nreason than it was sounding too much\nlike we were ripping off Top Gear, and\nwe all know the shirt, jeans and blazer\ncombination Jeremy Clarkson wears\nevery week is an anti-inspiration (if one\ncan even exist) to anyone in fashion.\nHence, I present to you the Sick/\nShit Wall. Now looking at it, the wall\nis rather ankle-or-below-based. I don\u2019t\nhave a weird foot fetish as you might\nthink. This week\u2019s wall has been especially assembled with the inspiration of\nthe other editors in the felix office. I\u2019m\nnot lazy, I\u2019m just all up for team partici-pation. That\u2019s the official line anyway.\nOur main article this week addresses\nthe issue of celebrity capsule collections that have invaded the highstreet\nin recent years. Kate Moss has some\ncredibility in her launch of her Topshop range, whilst Pixie Geldof and the\nlike have none. They don\u2019t have any real\nlicense to launch anything other than\na valid career which isn\u2019t leeching off\ntheir name. I\u2019m waiting for the launch\nof a male celebrity collection. I laugh at\nthe thought of someone like Pete Doherty selling replica garments through\nTopman, featuring his signature skag-induced-soilage marks. To treat you\nlucky fashionistas, we\u2019re introducing\nanother new feature which follows on\nfrom the Freshers\u2019 guide to local shopping in the SW\u2019s. Anonymous is based\non Kings Road, which I demand anyone that goes to Imperial and remotely\ninterested in some serious shopping to\ngo down to and spend a few hours of\nyour otherwise worthless lives looking\nat things you probably can\u2019t afford. We\nowe an introduction to two new writers for felix fashion, Victoria and Swiri.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be reading a lot more\nfrom them in the coming weeks.\nAs I\u2019ve always said, and I\u2019m becoming\na bit of a parrot, if you want to write\nfor felix fashion, email your articles to\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Contributions are welcome and makes my life\na lot easier. Maybe I am lazy.\nDaniel Wan\nFashion Editor\nA\u00ad\n\u2013List on the cheap\nVictoria Masding discusses the celebrity-highstreet culture\nI\nam a sucker for supply and\ndemand. If something is in\nshort supply or limited edi-tion, damn it, I want it! That\u2019s\nwhy I end up putting massive\nmaximum bids on Ebay, then hoping\nno-one pushes up the price on that \u2018too\ncool\u2019 jacket; but that is not my point.\nRecently, you have probably noticed\nlots of clothing chains have started\nto introduce quick turnover capsule\ncollections, often fronted or even \u2018designed\u2019 by celebrities. Even though I\nknow I am being manipulated, it\u2019s not\nall bad.\nUniqlo, for example, teamed up with\nLogan Power Graphixx and The Kusano Design Office to produce a range\nof unique limited edition T\u2019s to be sold\nin their NYC flagship store. Of course,\nthis worked out for the guys at Uniqlo;\nthe T-shirts were a sell out. It appeared\nthe allure for consumers was not simply the limited stock, but also the design talent behind the T\u2019s. Definitely a\nhit.\nAnother hit earlier this summer was\nwhen online fashion megastore asos.\ncom teamed up with graduate students\nfrom The London College of Fashion\nand launched the ASOS LTD 100 Collection.Anonlinefrenzyensuedthanks\nto well planned publicity during Graduate Fashion Week and celebrities like\nmodel Agyness Deyn showcasing the\nbest garments. Most items sold out in\nminutes, each design perfectly unique\nin existence. Convincing people their\nclothing purchase is an investment is\nclever, and not without a glimmer of\ntruth with designer John Galliano and\nmodel Erin O\u2019Connor among the College\u2019s Alumni. These pieces could have\nbeen designed by the big names of tomorrow and as such this was the key\nfocus of this endeavour.\nMainstream designer collaborations\nlike the Victor & Rolf and Stella McCartney for H&M lines were also success-ful, as well as their smaller Madonnafronted range.\nI guess the heavyweight of celebrity fashion collections would be Kate\nMoss for Topshop. Again, the design\nquality is good \u2013 in part due to ripping\noff her existing wardrobe, but you cannot argue with the phenomenal success\nof her range. The pictures of devotion\non the faces of hundreds of eager shoppers outside Topshop Oxford Street at\nthe launch were almost biblical! She\nhas since become a seemingly permanent fixture of the Topshop brand.\nIt is not all good news, however. If\nyou\u2019ve seen any recent magazines you\nwill know that Peaches (Geldof) is a\nTopshop whore \u2013 she clearly wants\nwhat Kate Moss has. Sadly for Peaches\nher younger, more attractive sibling,\nPixie, has scored the deal with New\nLook. Not that I am particularly im-pressed. I think the correct term to\ndescribe my reaction would be that\nI \u2018scoffed\u2019 when I heard the news. I\nprefer the Gilmore Girls to the Geldof girls. Pixie\u2019s collection seems to be\nstandard \u2018rebel teen\u2019 fare, uninspiring\nwhilst filling me with smouldering in-difference. Nor was I a fan of the Lily\nAllen/New Look combo. I struggle to\nsee the relevance of this pair in connection to clothes designing. I don\u2019t like\nthe \u2018any-celeb-to-boost-sales\u2019 pattern.\nIt\u2019s the Mary Kate and Ashley theory.\nThey could offer your own shit to you\nwith a sticker of their faces on it and we\nwould buy! We\u2019re clearly doomed to be\nconsumer clones! Fuck it \u2013 bring it on!\nTopshop meet Kate, Kate meet\nthree million pounds\nShopping locally in the SWs\nWhat has Swiri Konje\u2019s boutique-spotting yielded this week?\nAnonymous by Ross & Bute.

Watch out as I bring you little titbits about shops\nto visit before you leave London.\nRolled-up jeans\nIts getting colder, so this is\nprobably the opposite of what\nyou want to be doing; but\nbeing practical is for losers\nwho turn up the heating in\ntheir room to simulate Level\n7 Dungeon environment. Roll\nup your jeans, anywhere up\nto just below your knees, and\nwatch your ankles go blue.\nNike Hi-Tops\nI wasn\u2019t ever too sure about\nthese. A little Chav and a bit\nNu-rave. The News Editor,\noddly enough, has convinced\nme otherwise. Get the right\ncolour, but don\u2019t dress too in-your-face, otherwise you\u2019ll just\nbe another pretentious prick.\nAnd we don\u2019t need more of\nthem at Imperial. Plus, Nike\nhave some new sweet variations on these out.\nSandals\nMany women have this thing\n\u2013 they wear sandals to \u2018fancy\u2019\nevents. They do this regardless of the time of year or\namount of expected precipi-ation. Very few high-heeled\nsandals suit women without\nmaking them look somewhat\n\u2018cheap\u2019. Unless you have\nabnormally good-looking feet\nand have found some incredible sandals, this is a dreadful\nidea.

But the fire\ncould be caused from anywhere in\nthe house. It might not even be a fire,\nbut any form of disaster, and my data,\nalong with all copies of backups will\nbe destroyed.\nHow can I prevent my paranoia? I\ncould use my 1 TB Terastation more\noften, or find some automatic software to backup my file changes on\nregular intervals. But I lack physical\nprotection on local disaster.\nI could promise to burn a monthly\nDVD, and send it to a friend\u2019s house.\nHere, I lack security of data, and risk\nbeing lazy and forgetting. The list\ngoes on. And sure, security is no big\nissue when using software such as\nTruecrypt, but this is another step\nbetween me and regular backups.\nIn an ideal world, I would have a\nfree, \u201cinfinite\u201d storage, earthquake-proof underground-bunker, which I\ncould make regular and encrypted\nbackups to with software which regularly looks for file changes and backs\nup on computer inactivity.\nUnfortunately, we are not in an ideal\nworld. There is a small choice of two\nconfigurations for the ideal world:\nThe storage is as above, but not free.\nThe storage is not infinite.\nMy worry about the first, is missing a payment. Being a student, I feel\nvery likely to miss one of my monthly\npayments, and therefore will lose my\nbackup data. A personal choice would\nbe to have the limited space, but with\nall the data protection and services as\nlisted.\nThere are numerous solutions, such\nas Microsoft\u2019s Sky Drive, XDrive,\ncron jobs, etc. One really caught my\neye since it was in beta, and that was\nMozy. Mozy\u2019s award-winning backup\nsoftware promises \u201cinsurance for\nyour data\u201d, and it definitely delivers\nwhat it promises.\nI have used it since Mozy was in\nbeta, and have always been satisfied.\nBackup up settings, firefox bookmarks\nand essential work-related documents\nmade my free 2 GB storage limit feel\nmore than satisfactory. Mozy\u2019s backup sets are very intelligent and easy to\nuse, something anyone who has had\nexperience with iTunes\u2019 smart play\nlists or similar and/or statements can\nmaster in seconds.\nThere was a point where I had to\nstop using Mozy when switching to\nmy Mac. There was no alternative\navailable, and I really loved Mozy\u2019s\nsolution. My prayers (and emails) have\nbeen answered recently when Mozy\nannounced their Mac version, which\nis equally excellent and unobtrusive.\nI forget it even runs and backs up my\ndata whilst I deal with my leg burns.\nIs 2 GB too small? Not a problem.\nYou can easily upgrade your account\nto a Mozy Home account, giving infinite storage for $4.95 / month. Or,\nyou could take my method, and use\nreferrals. Four referrals give an extra\ngigabyte of storage, and gives each\nperson who uses the referral code to\nsign up their share of the same space,\nand therefore both benefit from the\nMozy referral system.\nOne thing I am yet to understand\nabout Mozy\u2019s software, is the difference between their personal software\n(Mozy Home) and their business solution (Mozy Pro). Mozy Pro is more\nserver orientated, but does not offer too much more, and in fact, does\nNOT supply infinite storage. Unless\nthe extra features are needed, I recommend Mozy Home for now.\nI would begin this paragraph by saying \u201cOverall,\u201d but there is no need to.\nMozy is truly a great piece of software,\nand I am unable to say one bad thing\nabout it. I am not saying that Mozy is\ngreat \u201coverall\u201d, but completely.\nThis unobtrusive application runs in\nyour Windows XP/Vista system tray,\nor if you are using the (better) Mac OS\nX, it will run in your menu bar.

The iPhone Killer?\nA\nnew and exciting platform has risen from the\nInternet powerhouse\nthat is Google. With the\never-increasing popularity that is the mobile telecommunications market, various strides to\nimprove the functionality and ease of\nuse of these devices have been made.\nThe biggest revolution in recent\ntimes being Apple\u2019s popular iPhone.\nRevolutionising the way mobile\nphones are used, the iPhone has\nbrought full web-browsing, email,\nmusic playback and many other features in a new and intuitive way.\nHowever there is a new threat to this\nyoung super power. That threat is the\nGoogle Android platform.\nUnlike the iPhone, Android is only\nthe operating software. Designed by\nGoogle and free to be manipulated by\nclient users. The Android platform,\nwith its first iteration the T-Mobile\nG1, is right on track to provide an alternative user experience. Android\u2019s\ncustomising ability allows users to\nhave an equally intuitive and \u201cfun\u201d\nadventure when using their phone.\nWith compatibility for almost any\nfeature the phone\u2019s hardware may\ncontain, end-users will be able to\nbrowse the Internet, email and add\napplications like the best of them.\nAndroid has also been successfully\ninstalled on current phones such as\nNokia\u2019s N810 Internet tablet, with\nintriguing results. Expect Android to\nfilter its way to future phones. Look at him. So cute. I want one... or 2, maybe 3.

All we garnered from the trailers was \u2018wham\u2019 lots\nof famous actors are in it, \u2018wham\u2019 it\u2019s\nfunny and \u2018wham\u2019 it\u2019s a Coen Brother\u2019s\nfilm. Which is essentially, all it really\nis.\nThe style of this film is slick, witty\nand irreverent. The plot-line itself is\nalmost devoid of true end-point mate-rial, but the real genius is in the comic\nacting and the delivery.\nFrancis McDormand plays \u2018Linda\nLitzke\u2019 a lonely, hapless and somewhat ageing gym employee who is on\na desperate quest for plastic surgery.\nTeamed with the hilarious and moronic Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) they\nchance upon a CIA agent\u2019s memoirs in\nthe ladies\u2019 locker room, and believing it\nto be \u2018real high-up intelligent spy stuff\u2019\nthey quickly get themselves whisked\ninto a world of secrecy, Russians, bribery and disappearing bodies.\nJohn Malkovich is superb as a\ngrouchy old agent who \u2018doesn\u2019t have a\ndrinking problem!\u2019 and finds himself\nunwillingly mixed up in the plot-line\nwhich revolves peculiarly around his\nrelationship and concurrent divorce\nwith his \u2018cold, stuck-up bitch\u2019 of a wife,\nimpeccably delivered by Tilda Swinton. George Clooney is brilliant as the\nparanoid womanising character Harry,\nwho dips in and out of all the characters\u2019 lives with no real purpose, and\nthe expressions he provides, trust me,\nare priceless. This film centres on the\nconfusion created by nothing leading\nto a lot of something. I don\u2019t want to\ngive any more away, as the surprises\nare just so perfect. I would thoroughly\nrecommend you get yourself down to\nsee this - for a comedy that is like no\nother. It\u2019s not a rom-com, chick-flick,\nit\u2019s a laugh-out-loud cleverly made little film that will hold your attention for\nthe 96 minutes and longer.\nA beginner\u2019s guide to the cinema brought to you by the Film Cynic Clinic\nThis week we look at what could be\nconsidered quite simply the most important part of any film experience. It\nis of course the cinema, and this article\nwill attempt to examine the delicate\ninterplay of this ancient popcorn-stenched establishment and the films\nwe see within it. Nowadays with the\nplethora of methods for distributing\nand viewing movies, of which 98% are\nillegal, it\u2019s important to take a sentimental look back on the institute that\nstarted it all.\nThanks to market forces, most cinemas now reside on the outskirts\nof towns alongside other quality establishments such as bowling alleys,\nfast food outlets, and drug dens. For\nthose lucky enough to find somewhere vaguely near habitation, your\nfirst experience will be the \u00a32+ parking charge for daring to park nearby.\nSome hospitable multiplexes will refund the cost of parking, provided that\nyou retain your ticket stub, car parking\nticket, have received the appropriate\nstamp from the cashier, have arrived\nbetween 3.00-3.05pm and are over 65.\nThis inevitably lulls the majority of us\ninto not bothering, upon the simple\nand reasonable excuse that life, quite\nfrankly, is too short.\nAssuming that you\u2019ve managed to\nfind a parking space, far enough away\nfrom those kids who seem to be using\naerosols as flamethrowers, the next\nshock is inside. As you glance over the\nred information displays, which alternate faster than strobe lighting, you\u2019ll\ncome across the small sticker by the\nticket desk listing the prices. That can\u2019t\nbe right! It must be a typo \u2013 someone\nmust have put the decimal point in the\nwrong place! Oh no, they haven\u2019t. It\u2019s a\nshame that you can\u2019t barter nowadays.\nIf you could, then there\u2019d be the chance\nto offset some of the ticket price by\npart-exchanging the car you arrived in.\nBut it\u2019s okay if you haven\u2019t brought that\nbriefcase full of cash with you. There\u2019s\nalways a cashpoint nearby, complete\nwith a minimum \u00a31.50 charge for us-Stuart Higgins ing it.\nNever mind, there can\u2019t be that many\nother opportunities to spend your hard\nearned cash (or perhaps a not-so hard\nearned student loan) before settling\ndown to see the film. However as the\nsickly sweet scent of despair wafts over\nfrom the food counter you can\u2019t help\nbut glance at its preservative, conserv-ative, E-number-rammed goodness. A\ncinema is one of those few places where\nyou can successfully exceed the daily\nrecommended allowance of salt and fat\nfour times over with just one hotdog.\nSimilarly the pick and mix counter is\nperhaps one of the more fun elements\nof confectionary purchasing, but it\u2019s\nworth bearing in mind that in the current economic climate, it\u2019s cheaper per\ngram to buy gold bullion than a handful of jelly beans.\nLadled down with popcorn and coke,\nboth of which seem to be sold by the\ntonne, you can eventually struggle\npast the attendant into the bowels of\nthe building itself. There is something\nstrangely enthralling about watching\nsomeone carefully tear a stack of tickets in half, tell you which screen to go\nto, whilst simultaneously texting their\nmates. However you\u2019re nearly there.\nOnce you\u2019ve stumbled up the poorly-lit\nsteps and found a seat that\u2019s far enough\naway from the couple snogging noisily\nat the back and those kids in the corner\nwho seem to be using aerosols in flam-ethrowers, there\u2019s a chance to relax.\nSo sit back and enjoy the half hour of\nadverts, however tempting they might\nbe, because after the adventure of getting here, you haven\u2019t got money left to\nspend on them anyway.\nComments?\nSend to: not_gavin@hotmail.com\nPriya Garg\nBurn after reading HHHHK\nDirectors: Ethan & Joel Coen\nWriters: Ethan & Joel Coen\nCast: John Malkovich,\nTilda Swinton,\nGeorge Clooney,\nBrad Pitt\nFrost/Nixon HHHHK\nDirector: Ron Howard\nWriter: Peter Morgan\nCast: Frank Langella,\nMicheal Sheen,\nKevin Bacon\nJust before entering the cinema to\nsee the newest Ron Howard feature\nFrost/Nixon, someone asked me\nwhether I was interested in American\npolitics and if I\u2019d seen the original\nNixon interviews conducted by Frost.\nAs I met the aforementioned person\nbarely a minute beforehand, I decided\nit would be foolish to confess that I\nam utterly ignorant about history:\npolitics in particular.\nTo keep my pride intact I made up\nsome excuse, saying that I tried to see\nfilms with a completely open mind,\nwithout previous prejudices and preconceptions and other such hogwash.\nIt\u2019s nice to see actors having fun the old-fashioned way.\nI was also visibly deflated. Had I just\nspent 11 quid to sit through a two\nhour long opinion-forming, propagandist semi-documentary? Despite\nthat, I started scouring my brain for\nthe keyword \u2018Nixon\u2019. Success! I found\nan entry in my brain\u2019s version of the\nInternet Movie Database. Nixon, Watergate, Redford and, aha, All The\nPresident\u2019s Men - that\u2019s what my\nknowlege of the Watergate affair\ncame down to - a Hollywood blockbuster from the 70s when conspiracy theory was \u2018cool\u2019. And here\ncomes my first surprise: you will not\nlearn any more about that extremely\nembarrassing moment in American\ndemocracy from this movie, even\nthough it\u2019s structured like a historical\ndocumentary.\nThe director assumes that American political history is part of the core\ncurriculum in every nation\u2019s education system and hence does not waste\nvaluable film reel to go into any detail\nabout the political espionage, illegal\nbreak-ins, tax and campaign frauds\nand secret hush funds that make up\nWatergate, the affair that is responsible for the \u2018-gate\u2019 ending given to every\npolitical scandal ever since 1972 and\nthe reason for the first and (so far) last\ntime an American president resigned\nhis position.\nInstead of focusing on rehashing the\ndrama and excitement of the immediate aftermath of the affair, the movie\ncentres on a series of four interviews\nwith Tricky Dicky (Nixon\u2019s nickname\nwhile in office) which were created\nand conducted by an English TV\npresenter David Frost a few months\nafter the frenzy died down. In order\nto find his way back to the American\nTV scene Frost came up with the idea\nof interviewing the ex-president who\nhad yet to confess to being part of\nWatergate.\nThe movie hinges on these two\nwonderfully complex characters for\nwhom the outcome of the interviews\nbecomes a matter of winning or failing at life. Nixon saw the interviews\nas an unmissable opportunity to regain the respect he craved. Armed\nwith his ex-chief of staff Jack Brennan\n(Kevin Bacon) and a group of bibliographers and PR sharks he prepares\nhimself to convince Americans that\nhis presidency was a success. By the\nend of the story, Frost finds that he\nhas put everything he has - money,\ncareer, reputation - on the line and\nhe realizes that the only way he can\ncome out successful is if he prevents\nNixon from redeeming himslef during the interviews. What follows is\na truly gripping encounter, a boxing match where rethoric replaces\npunches, psychological games replace\nthe footwork and thorough research\nof the subject replaces powerful left\nand right knock-out hooks.\nJoining the rest of the audience\nin the applause at the end, the little eloquence I possess disappeared\ncompletely and all I was left with\nwas a very surprised \u2018wow\u2019. Can\npolitics really be this interesting?\nFilms we love at Imperial\nIt\u2019s pretty difficult to choose a favourite\nfilm - what makes one film stand out\nfrom the rest and warrant being cham-pioned? For me, it\u2019s the feeling I get\nwhen I watch it \u2013 it\u2019s the film I put on\nwhen I need cheering up, or to regain\nmy faith in humanity! My favourite\nfilm is \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle\u2019.\nFor those of you who have never\nheard of it before, \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving\nCastle\u2019, or \u2018Hauru No Ugoku Shiro\u2019, is\na Japanese anime film directed by the\nlegend of the anime world, Hayao Miyazaki. The story is set in a magical\nland and tells a heartwarming and uplifting fairy tale.\nTo give you just a taste: there\u2019s a castle which can be in four places at once;\nthere\u2019sSophie,ayounggirltransformed\ninto an old woman by an evil witch;\nthere\u2019s Howl, an extremely handsome,\nbut very vain wizard, as well as many\nmore imaginative yet surprisingly human characters. Classic escapism, and\nyes, I love it!\n\u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle\u2019 has a very unusual (for anime) mix of European and\nJapanese styles due to the British novel\nit is based on; think a quaint Austrian\ntown and steam trains with Miyazaki\u2019s\ndistinct styling. I find the attention to\ndetail and character animation in the\nfilm extraordinary - the castle alone is\nbreathtaking. Every frame would stand\nalone as a true work of art, showing\ntraditional animation is anything but a\nthing of the past.\nIn my opinion, anime is best watched\nin Japanese (with English subtitles) -the language it\u2019s created in. However,\nin this case, I would recommend the\nEnglish dubbing, as the film benefits\nfrom the gorgeous Christian Bale as\nHowl, screen legend Lauren Bacall as\nold Sophie and Billy Crystal, who is hilarious as a fire demon.\nUnderlying the main story, as with\nevery Miyazaki movie, is an important message. In this case, it is a very\nstrong anti-war message, along with\nundercurrents of the power of love, inner beauty, and self-esteem. All of this,\nhowever, is done without being childish\nor clich\u00e9d, which can happen so easily\nin movies these days. Instead, it draws\nyou in and is so human, feels so true to\nlife, that even the most cynical person\n(me) will be utterly convinced, despite\nthe film not having a particulary strong\nstoryline. Plus, and more importantly,\nit gives you the warm and fuzzy feeling\nthat we all secretly love.\nThat\u2019s the strangest castle I\u2019ve ever seen. Where\u2019s the moat?\nEmma Stokes\nStudent\nImperial College students, lecturers and staff share their\ntreasured movies with felix. This week: Howl\u2019s Moving Castle\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nIf there\u2019s a film you just can\u2019t\nstop talking about, a movie\nthat inspires you, a feature that\nchanged your life or one that is\nyour only remedy for a miserable day, we would love you to\nwrite about it and have the guts\nto share it with the rest of Imperial, just like Emma.\nSend a few hundred words\nabout the film you love to:\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMost people take for granted the fact\nthat they live in the \u2018developed\u2019 world,\na place where modern medicine,\nplumbing and central heating are seen\nas a basic human right. But as Gomorrah shows, Italy, a \u2018developed\u2019 country,\nwhich is classified as one of the \u2018Big\nFive\u2019 nations of Europe (along with\nus), proves that aspects of the \u2018developing\u2019 world, such as complete poverty\nand dog-eat-dog violence, can be a lot\ncloser to home.\nGomorrah tells the story of two rival gangs living in and around a rough\ncouncil estate in Naples, Italy. But\nthese gangs are not how we would view\nthem. These young men do not sit at\nthe back of a bus in hoodies and blare\nmusic from their mobile phones, nor\ndo they have huge ugly dogs to make\nthem look \u2018hard\u2019.\nThe youths in this film kill each other\nfor a living, deal drugs and help dump\ntoxic waste for Mafia crime lords as\npart of their normal lives. And if you\nwant to be a part of the gang, all you\nhave to do is prove yourself as a man:\nby being shot while wearing a bul-let-proof vest. Although this sounds\nshocking, and pretty average fare for a\nnormal gangster film, it makes the film\nall the more disturbing to watch when\nyou know it is real.\nBased on a true story written by Roberto Saviano, Gomorrah begins with an\nunexpected and jaw-dropping opening,\nsetting up a film that you know will be\ncompletely unpredictable for the entire journey, forcing undue tension in\nthe audience that stays with you for the\nduration of the film\u2019s 137 minutes.\nThe plot of gangland murders and\ndrug deals is told through the eyes of\nseveral different characters, chopping\nand changing abruptly as it jumps from\none life to another. The protagonists\nwith whom we \u2018hang around\u2019 vary\nfrom the likeable Toto, a young boy\nwho works in a shop for his mother,\nand the despicable Boxer and Pitbull,\ntwo teenagers who aspire to be like\ntheir hero Scarface and kill as many\npeople as they can.\nAs this is a slow-burning drama, it is\nhard to actually explain a specific plot\nthread as there are so many, but all of\nthem are portrayed in such a realistic and terrifying way that you will be\ncompelled to stay in your seat until the\nexplosive conclusion.\nThe cast and director are just a few\nof the reasons why Gomorrah is good\non so many different levels, as it also\nraises a myriad of profound issues including identity, poverty, and most\nimportantly, how people can live this\nlifestyle on a day-to-day basis and consider it \u2018normal\u2019.\nThis is edge-of-your-seat stuff that\nis not for the faint of heart. It is, how-ever, highly recommended for all those\nwho consider themselves to be \u2018film\nbuffs\u2019, as this is a well-crafted piece of\ncinema.\nGomorrah is a film that combines\nstrong performances with raw realism.\nMix this together with the fact that you\nknow it all really happened, and you\u2019re\nleft with a film that will haunt you for\ndays after watching it.\nRaw to the core \u2013 Gomorrah\nGomorrah HHHHK\nDirector: Matteo Garrone\nWriters: Various\nCast: Salvatore Abruzzese,\nSimone Sacchettino,\nSalvatore Ruocco,\nVincenzo Fabricino\nStealing guns from the Mafia can make you do strange things, like forgetting to put your clothes on.\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nFor those of you who are fans of Batman Begins and the Resident Evil tril-ogy, this is a film to watch out for, as it\nis already causing a stir in film fanatic\ncircles. \u201cWhy?\u201d you may ask.\nWell, not only is Mark Wahlberg\nstarring in this computer game adaptation as the title character, a vengeful\npoliceman searching for retribution\nagainst those responsible for the death\nof his wife and child, but the cast also\nincludes Mila Kunis \u2013 who some may\nrecognise as Jackie in \u2018That 70\u2019s Show\u2019\n\u2013 as a sexy assassin who aids him in his\nquest, as well as rapper Ludacris and\nnew Bond girl Olga Kurylenko.\nInclude stylish directing, an action-packed plot and a whole lot of guns,\ngore and girls \u2013 what more could you\nask for?\nJonathan Dakin\nComing soon:\nMark Wahlberg as Max Payne\nMark Wahlberg looks hot.\nCompetition\nThis week we have three DVD copies of Asylum to give away.\nAsylum is a terrifying tale of a\ngroup of undergraduate university\nstudents discovering that their dormitory was formerly an experimental mental health institution, which\nsoon reawakens their own buried\npersonal traumas.\nThis disturbing horror film will\nbe just the thing to watch from behind the sofa while ignoring Trick\nor Treaters on Halloween night.\nIf you would like to win Asylum\njust in time for Halloween, then all\nyou have to do is answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the serial killer in the Halloween\nmovies?\nSend your answer to film.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk before 29th October.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n16 felix Friday 24 October 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editor \u2013 James Goldsack & Katya-yani Vyas\nH\nello and welcome to my\nfirst column as Politics Editor. During the\ncourse of this year both\nmyself and Katya-yani\nwill attempt to deliver the best politics\nthe world has to offer.\nThis week, yet again, has been dominated by the US elections, not surprisingly as the \u201cbig day\u201d is under 2 weeks\naway. While all eyes are cast across the\npond, Gordon Brown has had resurgence in the polls.\nThe increase in support for Barack\nObama due to the ongoing financial\ncrisis has been replicated in 10 Downing Street. Before the downturn of the\nglobal economy, Brown looked set to\nlose the next election by a landslide.\nPeople considered him Stalinist, bad\ntempered, dictatorial and, frankly, dull;\nhow things were different when times\nwere good...\nIn the current climate, Brown\u2019s de-meanour appears to give him an ad-vantage. The serious, commanding\nimage is good in a crisis right? All the\npolls agree.\nPerhaps people are reminiscing over\nthe 10 disgruntled years he served as\nChancellor under Tony Blair before the\ntop dog of spin shot himself in the foot\nduring the Iraq war (unfortunately this\noccurence is confined to metaphor).\nWhat are my feelings concerning our\nPM? Those who know me will be able\nto tell you.\nIn other news this week, the financial\ncrisis is continuing but with little effect\non most people in this country unless\nyou were unfortunate enough to pile\nyour money into Iceland. Bad move.\nRussian-Cuban relations are looking\nup which is not the best news the US\nhas heard in a while despite hankering to their President\u2019s war-mongering\nspirit.\nLast Sunday the Cubans, led by Raul\nCastro, celebrated the Cuban missile\ncrisis and scaring the crap out of the\nAmericans. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t see\nanother Bay of Pigs, one illegal war is\nenough of a mess. At least Russia has\na cease-fire in Georgia, ending that\nrampage.\nIt appears that in the last couple of\ndays the conservatives have been up to\ntheir tricks again, trying to evade a ban\non overseas donations.\nThe Church of England is doomed\naccording to an imigration minister,\nwhich comes at the same time as rather a lot of people getting rather angry\nover abortion - mostly those religious\ntypes.\nWhen having a minor crisis attempting to think of something other\nthan the disappearing economy and\nthe battle to be the next \u201cleader of the\nfree world\u201d to write about, one particularly inspired chap told me to write\n\u201cany old bollocks, it\u2019s only a student\nnewspaper.\u201d\nWell, my friends, we here at Felix are\nserious about these few scraps of paper but we need your input to make it\nbetter and enable me to be lazy. Palm\nleaves and grapes please.\nLike death and taxes in life, nothing\nis more certain to feature daily in the\nnews media than the U.S. Presidential\nelection. It is to journalism what jokes\nabout the gender ratio are to Imperial; unavoidable. The number of column inches devoted to discussion on\nthe virtues or shortcomings of John\nMcCain and Barack Obama is even\nmore impressive than the mammoth\nsums of money raised by the Obama\ncampaign.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s examine\nanother topic and, instead of asking\n\u201cDoes McCain represent 4 more years\nof Bush?\u201d or \u201cDoes Obama lack the\nexperience for the most important job\nin the world\u201d, let us wonder; what has\nGeorge W. Bush, as both politicians\nfrom both parties openly and repeatedly disavow themselves of him, been\ndoing in his last days of office?\nObviously the financial crisis hasn\u2019t\nescaped your notice and, one would\nhope it still catches the attention of, in\nthe words of The Daily Show host Jon\nStewart, \u2018still \u2013 President\u2019 Bush. While\nthe crisis unfolded Bush stuck firm to\nthe Reagan-Thatcherite philosophy\nof refraining from government intervention but when the fall of Lehman\nBrothers shocked the financial sector\nand the economy in general, he embraced the adage, as Chairman of the\nFederal Reserve Ben Bernanke para-phrased, \u201cThere are no atheists in foxholes and similarly no ideologues in a\nfinancial crisis\u201d. Thus came Presidential Addresses to the American public\nwarning of the greatest crisis since the\nGreat Depression; I\u2019m sure he almost\ncame near to screaming \u2018all is lost\u2019\nwhilst pulling out his hair, just in case\npeople accused him of underestimating the enormity of the situation.\nWhen the President and the Federal\nReserve presented the $700bn bailout\nto the Senate and House of Representatives, neither the credit, nor the\nlimelight went to George W. Bush. The\nall-or-nothing high stakes game that is\nthe election race between Obama and\nMcCain overshadowed the economic\ncrisis and the main question asked by\nmany reporters was \u201cWho will benefit\nmost from this in the polls?\u201d With Congressmen, Federal Reserve officials and\nthe Presidential candidates contesting\nthe limelight and patting themselves\non the back for a job well done on the\nbailout bill, President Bush was forced\nback to the irrelevancy of the Oval Office. Indeed at a time when firm, consistent and visible leadership is needed\nto restore confidence, or at least stem\nthe tide of distrust, in the markets,\nPresident Bush\u2019s behaviour has predictably bordered on incompetent.\nWith no planned campaign appearances this election and the handling of\nthe financial crisis falling to the Federal Reserve and Congress, Bush has\nbeen looking to shore up his legacy\non the international stage, notably by\nabandoning almost every foreign policy decision of the last 8 years. The\nU.S.\u2019s hard line on North Korea has\nvanished as completely as McCain\u2019s\npost-convention bounce. The oppressive nation, that was once part of the\ninfamous \u2018Axis of Evil\u2019, is now treated\nto regular talks with the U.S. and has\nrecently, in a move aimed to save the\nprogress made on North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, been removed from\nWashington\u2019s list of state sponsors of\nterrorism. Pyongyang had begun to\nend its\u2019 freeze on nuclear activity because Washington refused to remove\nNorth Korea\u2019s status as a sponsor of\nterrorism until a list of its\u2019 nuclear as-sets, that the regime had submitted to\nthe U.S., was verified.\nNow that the dismantling of North\nKorea\u2019s nuclear programme now back\non track, the Bush Administration is\nclearly taking heart from the success\nthat diplomacy has brought, where\ntough words and threats failed. It is\ntrying to apply the same lessons learnt\nin North Korea to Iran, with the hope\nof persuading the theocratic regime to\nend its nuclear activities before, rather\nthan after as in the case of North Korea, it tests a nuclear weapon. A U.S.\nInterests Office is due to be opened in\nTehran in November; an Interests Office serves the purpose of an embassy\nbut doesn\u2019t carry the acknowledgement\nof formal ties that an embassy carries.\nThis move ends a 29 year freeze in\nU.S.-Iranian diplomatic relations and\nshows the commitment to diplomacy\nof an administration that knows it\ndoesn\u2019t have the political capital to order strikes before its term ends.\nAlthough Bush seems to be on an intense scramble to achieve world peace\n(he has reportedly delivered a letter\nto Syrian President Bashar Assad that\nproposes Israel pull-out of the Golan\nHeights if Syria end ties with Iran),\nwhich mostly involves eating his words,\nhe faced some criticism from his allies.\nThe new Japanese Prime Minister Taro\nAso is unhappy at the U.S.\u2019s decision\nto remove North Korea from the list.\nThis stems from Japan\u2019s, along with\nSouth Korea\u2019s, position as a prime target for any North Korean attacks and\nalso from the fact that the day before\nthe U.S.\u2019s announcement, Japan\nextended its port ban on\nNorth Korean ships;\nthe lack of co-or-dination here\nis painfully\napparent.\nJapan\u2019s port\nban began\nin October\n2006 after\nNorth Korea conducted a\nWhat\u2019s Bush been doing?\nWith the Presidential election dominating the news, felix checks up on \u2018Dubya\u2019\nnuclear test but the lack of progress on\nthe ban stems from a dispute in the 70\u2019s\nand 80\u2019s caused by the abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korean agents.\nThe issue evokes strong emotions in\nJapan. A telephone call between Condoleeza Rice and the Japanese Foreign\nMinister Hirofumi Nakasone degenerated into a shouting match as Rice\ndemanded of the Japanese, \u201cget out of\nour way and let us do this\u201d. As China\u2019s\nstrategic weight increases, and Japans\nconversely decreases, this is likely to be\nthe tone from Washington in coming\nyears.\nThings aren\u2019t all bad for George\nBush. Despite disagreements with the\nJapanese and the rather premature schadenfreude of his German\nallies on the financial crisis, there are\nthings that should make his day better.\nSome publications, such as Newsweek,\nare already asking \u201cWhat did Bush\nget right\u201d and the growing consensus\nwithin the United States is that the\nSurge has corrected the errors of the\nIraq war. If this doesn\u2019t put a smile on\nhis face, maybe hosting a global financial summit in November will; nothing raises your spirit than being given\nthe chance to act important in front of\nyour peers, even if you barely deserve\nthe opportunity. In the meantime, U.S.\nPresident George W. Bush would do\nwell to turn off the T.V., put down the\nnewspapers and ignore the constant\nand unceasing references to\n\u201ceight years of failed\npolicies\u201d.\nKadhim Shubber\nPolitics Correspondent\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 24 October 2008 felix\nPolitics\nIn direct conflict with his own party, Colin Powell has given his support to Barack Obama\nColin Powell, the former US Secretary\nof State, announced his endorsement\nto the Democrat campaign last week.\nSpeaking on NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press\u2019,\nPowell expressed his disappointment\nand dissatisfaction with the McCain\ncampaign.\n\"I think we need a transformational\nfigure. I think we need a president who\nis a generational change and that's why\nI'm supporting Barack Obama, not out\nof any lack of respect or admiration\nfor Senator John McCain,\" said Powell, who had also served as Chairman\nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the\nClinton and Bush Jr administrations.\nPowell\u2019s support will provide a boost\nto Obama\u2019s perceived lack of foreign\npolicy experience and national security\ncredentials. But Powell doesn\u2019t believe\nthis to be the main hurdle in Obama\u2019s\nquest for the White house. The constant aura of negativity and smear\ntactics that are, in Powell\u2019s view, being\nused by the McCain campaign are just\na step too far.\nHe remarked that senior members\nof his own party were talking about\nObama being a Muslim. To which\nPowell rebuked, \u201cWell, the correct\nanswer is, he is not a Muslim. He's a\nChristian, has always been a Christian.\nBut the really right answer is, 'What if\nhe is? Is there something wrong with\nbeing a Muslim in this country?' The\nanswer's 'No, that's not America.'\u201d\nMcCain brushed off the revelation\nby saying, \u201cWell, again, we have a very,\nwe have a respectful disagreement, and\nI think the American people will pay\nclose attention to our message for the\nfuture and keeping America secure.\nWe're long-time friends. This doesn't\ncome as a surprise.\" He went on to\nstate that he had the support of numerous other senior and respected figures\nof the Republican Party, such as Henry\nKissinger and Alexander Haig.\nHowever, Powell didn\u2019t stop there.\nHe went on to further attack his Party\nfor their ever-increasing drift to the\nRight and how this trend looks set to\ncontinue under McCain.\nFurthermore, he expressed his disillusionment about Palin, believing her\nnot to be ready for the Oval Office.\nPowell\u2019s words are likely to have a significant positive impact on the Obama\ncampaign. As a 26-year veteran of Congress and having played an active role\nin the Vietnam and the Gulf wars, his\nsupport provides the Obama campaign\nwith some serious ammunition.\nEven thought the polls are showing\nthat Obama is in the lead, anything is\npossible. Palin\u2019s cameo comedy appearance on Saturday Night Live, which\ndrew a record viewer turnout, went to\nshow that the McCain campaign may\nstill have a few tricks up its sleeve. But\nwith the dark clouds of Troopergate\nover Palins shoulders and McCains inability to arouse the voter\u2019s passions,\nwill such novelty items shift American\nvoter\u2019s opinions? Only time will tell.\nRaz Jabary\nPolitics Correspondent\nCuba commemorates the Missile Crisis\nColin Powell declares support for Obama\nExactly 46 years ago the world was on\nthe brink of nuclear war when things\ngot heated up in the Atlantic between\nthe American and Soviet naval pow-ers. The 1962 Missile Crisis as it is now\nknown saw a crucial turn in relations\nbetween the U.S. and the Soviet Union, leading to among other things the\nsetting up of the hotline between the\nWhite House and the Kremlin with the\nattempt to prevent risky future stand-offs.\nThe commemoration of the Crisis\nin Cuba was celebrated last Sunday\nwith the opening of the first Russian\nOrthodox Church in Havana that was\nattended by Raul Castro, which is his\nfirst commemoration of the Crisis as\nCuba\u2019s head of state. The opening of\nthe Church on October 19th, being\ndedicated as \u2018Day of Russia\u2019 was an\nattempt to improving Cuban-Russian\nties, which were damaged after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nMetropolitan Kiril, head of foreign\nrelations of the Russian Orthodox\nChurch, had travelled from Moscow\nto Havana in order to be present at\nthe ceremony. \u201cThis is a monument to\nRussian-Cuban friendship and all the\nefforts that have preserved our relations including the most difficult moments of the Cold War\u201d, he said.\nThe background of the Missile Crisis\nin 1962 was the stationing of potential\nSoviet nuclear warheads on mainland\nCuba that were in reach of targeting\nmain American urbanizations. Knowing this, the Americans posed a naval\nblockade on Cuba with the attempt of\ndisrupting the movement of shipments\nto and from its southern neighbour.\nThe height of the Crisis was reached\non October 27th when Soviet battleships were approaching the blockade\naround Cuba, before an agreement\nwas reached between the White House\nand Kremlin just moments before the\nwould-be clash. Although Cuba was\npossibly spared utter destruction, Fidel Castro accused Khrushchev of not\n\u2018standing up to the U.S.\u2019 and blamed\nhim for not consulting him on the decision to retreat the Soviet ships. Claiming that the Cubans were the ones\nliving through the toughest of times,\nindulged in the conflict between East\nand West, Castro demanded to play a\nmajor role in the matter. Several biographies on the Lider Maximo, including \u2018The Real Fidel Castro\u2019 by former\nBritish ambassador to Cuba Leycester\nColtman, describe how Fidel burst\ninto an outrage upon hearing the news\nof the Soviet retreat and even made\nKhrushchev out as \u2018the son of a bitch\u2019.\nThe 77-year old Raul Castro was one\nof the main figures in the 1959 overthrow of the Batista regime in Cuba,\nalongside his brother Fidel, revolutionary Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara and Camilo\nCienfuegos. The reforms implemented\nby Raul from February this year when\nhe was appointed the official follower of Fidel, which allowed Cubans\nto make use of modern technological\ncommunication equipment such as\nmobile phones and the internet, seem\nto conflict with the fact that Raul has\nbeen the one seen as more extreme.\nDuring Fidel\u2019s years as head of state,\nRaul\u2019s often more leftist Socialist beliefs allowed the former to justify his\nposition to the outside world to remain in power by asserting that if he\nbe removed, \u2018fiercer ones\u2019 would take\nover. Whereas Fidel Castro had not\naffiliated with the Communist Youth\nParty during his student years at the\nUniversity of Havana, Raul was often\nfound to show direct sympathy to the\nparty and was seen involved in its cam-paigns. In fact, had it not been because\nof the strategic and economic interest\nin siding with the Soviet Union during\nthe Cold War era, and of Fidel\u2019s association with Che, some analysts believe\nthat Cuba might never have turned\nCommunist after the triumph of the\n1959 revolution. It was Raul who introduced the would-be legendary Che\nto his brother Fidel in Mexico City in\n1955 and it was he who was the first\nto take the step of befriending the KGB\nservice by establishing contact with secret agent Nikolai Leonev.\nWith Fidel\u2019s closest lifetime associates Che and Camilo deceased, it is the\nquestion whether nepotism did actually play a role in the appointment of\nRaul as his follower. In contrast to Fidel, Raul has often been perceived as\n\u2018more amiable and quiet\u2019 and also differs in physical built. This has led some\nto believe Fidel and Raul merely to be\nmaternal \u201cstepbrothers\u201d.\nOn Monday October 20th the Cuban\nForeign Minister Felipe Perez Roque\narrived on an official visit to Mexico,\nwhere he was welcomed at the airport\nby cheering crowds shouting \u2018long live\nCuba, long live Fidel, long live Raul!\u2019.\nRoque spoke to Mexican business\nleaders on the salary reforms in Cuba\nthat ought to ensure that \u2018waiters do\nnot earn more than doctors\u2019. Currently,\nmost Cubans hold government jobs\nand earn the equivalent of an average\nof less than \u00a312 a month. Last week,\nCuba\u2019s state-owned oil company said\nthe country may have more than 20 billion barrels of oil, a claim which if true\nwould place Cuba among the top 20 oil\nproducing countries in the world and\ncould generate unprecedented wealth\nfor its government.\nOn May 23rd 2008, speaking to the\nCuban exile community in Florida,\nAmerican Democratic presidential\ncandidate Barack Obama said he will\nseek direct diplomacy with the Cuban\ngovernment if he be elected, something\nthat has not happened since John F.\nKennedy\u2019s presidency. Republican candidate John McCain denounced these\npromises and reiterated that Obama\nappeared to be \u2018too soft\u2019 in dealing with\nthis matter. Most of the Cuban exile\ncommunity in the United States, consisting mainly of well-paid profession-als, is eager to see the overthrow of the\nrule by the Castro brothers and make\nthe journey south to their country of\norigin. With currently a majority of the\n11.5 million strong Cuban population\nborn after1959, it appears to be Raul\nCastro\u2019s task in the current government to maintain the atmosphere for\nthe change brought about by the Revolucion in Cuba and prevent citizens,\nparticularly the younger generations\ngetting alienated and instead showing\nsympathy to the country\u2019s long-term\nSocialist political struggle.\nIt seems to be the question whether\nAmerican-Cuban ties would be restored to what they were before 1959\nwith the change in the top men of both\ncountries, a question which may be answered in less than two weeks time after the American presidential elections\non November 4th.\nThe revolution goes on as Cubans celebrate the Cuban Missile Crisis\nSalman Waqar\nPolitics Correspondent\n\n"

So I approached our first offering with an\nopen mind.\nI tried not to let the naff acoustic-muzak at the beginning put me off. I\nreally tried.\nAnd then a nasally American lady\ntold me to \u201cSit back and relax\u201d... well,\nfrankly she wasn\u2019t helping. I\u2019m afraid\nit went downhill from there. October\nmight be a great month for astronomy,\nbut I wasn\u2019t persuaded to go out and\nsquint up at the sky.\nI fear any of you with such delusions\nwill be scuppered by London\u2019s ambient\nlight pollution anyway. Back to nasal-lady: \u201cTake a look at the moon!\u201d she\nsays.\nOk. There it is. The moon. Doing its\nthing, waxing and waning. Full moon,\nhalf moon... Does she do this every\nmonth?\nOn to astronomical highlights...oh\nGod, I can\u2019t take another 46 minutes.\nSkip to the end... some telescope tips,\nthe shipping forecast for space heads,\nand some jazz-funk to finish.

These drugs are usually used to treat mental illnesses. An\nexample would be the drug \u2018Ritalin\u2019\nwhich treats children with Hyperactive Attention Deficit Disorder\n(ADHD). Nature journal also conducted a survey in order to discover\nthe number of people using drugs\nto increase their \u2018brain power\u2019, it\nwas found that 1400 individuals had\nconfessed that they used cognitive\nenhancing drugs for non-medical\nreasons, most were either students or\nshift workers.\nAmongst 20% of these users, 44% of\nthem used the drug Provigil; a drug\nthat eliminates daytime tiredness\nin patients with narcolepsy (a rare\nsleeping disorder).\nSo how do these healthy people get\nthese drugs? It was found that these\ndrugs were obtained online or by\noverseas prescriptions.\nThis week\u2019s Astronomy.com podcast\n(official podcast of Astronomy Magazine) starts with some advice for \u201cnoobies\u201d. That\u2019s me. Oh, it\u2019s only binocular\nadvice.\nRemember kids; make yourself as\ncomfy as possible when stargazing.\nWe don\u2019t want any neck injuries.

You\u2019ll also be surrounded\nby some of the most respected lawyers in their\nfields. This is a firm where you\u2019ll learn fast and be\nstretched, but you\u2019ll also get plenty of support\nand encouragement along the way. There\u2019s no\nover-hiring of trainees, either. We\u2019re particularly\nproud of the fact that so many of the lawyers who\ntrained with us have gone on to become partners.\nWe would like to invite you to come along to\nour Career Presentation and Drinks Reception\nto learn more about the training offered at\nBristows. The Presentation and Drinks will be\nheld in the Huxley Building, Lecture Theatre 340\nlevel 3 on Wednesday 29 October at 6.30pm\nuntil 9.00pm.\nMore Astronomy Music greets the intrepid listener of Astronomy Cast. The\nuniverse is TRYING TO KILL US. Not\nnow dummy, in 2012. Hogwash, says\npresenter Pamela Gay. We might collide with a super-massive black hole in\nthe centre of our galaxy, but not for 700\nmillion years (how does she know this?\nIf she\u2019s wrong, where do I find her?).\nShe has a way with words, Ms Gay:\nVenus and Uranus are \u201clike problem\nchildren\u201d, rotating on their sides and\ngenerally travelling in the wrong di-rection. I worry about Pam\u2019s kids. And\n\u2018wrong\u2019 is fairly subjective, depending\nas it does on our direction being \u2018right\u2019.\nAt least Venus has a nice orbit. Ours\nis imperfect. Astronomy Cast is great\nactually, 90% of it being about disaster\nscenarios \u2013 what happens when the sun\nfizzles out? Can we see dead stars eve-rywhere? \u2013 and other 10% deep questions like \u2018why are black holes drawn\nwith jets coming out of them, when\nnothing can escape one?\u2019 Even Pam\ndoesn\u2019t know that one. Quick, snappy\nanswers, good analogies, and interesting question choices. Mostly involving\nthe end of the universe. Check out next\nweek\u2019s episode on aliens.\nhttp://www.astronomycast.com\nYes! Oh yes!\nFinally a British offering,\ncomplete with a\nChurchill insurance parody at\nthe beginning.\nMy prayers an-swered.

News from the LHC (not\ngood, but at least Geneva gets heating this winter), and SETI researchers\nfrom the University of Hawaii (seri-ously?) think we might have already\nseen alien signals, we just don\u2019t know\nit. What have they been smoking? Imperial\u2019s very own returning PhD rock\nstar Brian May also gets a mention.\nThese guys are \u00fcber-geeky, but in\na kind of endearing way. Prof. Jim\nCordes from Cornell University joins\nthe team for a chat. He sounds like the\nguy from the Fast Show. He loves his\npulsars: \u201cThey just keep giving and\ngiving\u201d. Don\u2019t I know it. Ahem. Later\non, a guy manages the hitherto impossible feat of saying \u201cglobal warming\u201d\nin quotation marks. The website for\nthis is brilliant too, and if one hour is\ntoo big a chunk of astronomy (and I\nsympathise) you can download each\nindividual segment separately.\nhttp://www.jodcast.net/\nThe exhibit opens on the 31st October\nat the Natural History Museum. Here\nare two of the highly commended photos from this year.\n\u201cNight Griffon\u201d\n\u201cAt dusk, Safie\u2019s natural-history group\nset up camp near the Kirtik river, on the\nRussian side of the Caucasus mountain\nrange. As darkness fell, Safie set off to\nlook for insects to photograph. Searching some rocks with her torch, she suddenly realised she had illuminated a\npair of eyes. Just metres away, staring\nback at her from its perch, was a griffon\nvulture. \u2018I was shocked - and impressed\nby the striking beauty of the bird,\u2019 she\nsays. Safie quickly took control of the\nsituation and shot two portraits. The\nmoment was fleeting. The vulture\nhissed loudly, launched off and flapped\ninto the night.\u201d\n\u201cDaddy long legs\u201d\n\u201cJordi came across this strange arrangement of spikes and spines while diving\nnear Puerto de Mog\u00e1n off the southern\ncoast of Grand Canary in the Canary Islands. As he moved in closer, he realised\nthey were a male and female arrow crab\nbacked against long-spined sea urchins.\nThe female had eggs in her swollen\nabdomen, and her mate was standing\nover her, clasping her with his clamps\nto stop other males from mating with\nher. Arrow crabs are often found with\nsea urchins, presumably using them as\nprotection from predators \u2013 their impossibly long legs useful for avoiding\nactual contact with the urchins. \u2018The\nspikes and tangle of long legs made a\nwonderfully graphic image,\u2019 says Jordi,\n\u2018and the cobalt-blue background with a\nschool of small silver fish flitting past\nwas like a sky ofstars. I also found their\nbehaviour very interesting \u2013 this image\nis not just a portrait, it\u2019s a story.\u201d\n\u201cNight griffon\u201d By Safie Al Khaffaf (Russia): 15-17 year old category\n\u00a9 Safie Al Khaffaf / Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2008\n\u201cDaddy long legs\u201d By Jordi Chias (Spain): the underwater world\ncategory \u00a9 Jordi Chias / Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2008\nProfessor Sahakian stated that there\nis an urgent need for safety tests, because the long-term effects of these\ndrugs on healthy people are currently\nnot known.\nIn addition, Professor Sahakian was\nconcerned at the ages groups of theses\ndrug users, this is because of the belief\nthat the drugs\u2019 popularity are spreading to consecutively younger people\nand students.\nThe Academy for Medical Sciences\n(AMS) declared that not only Ritalin\nwas being used for non-medical rea-sons, but so were drugs that are used\nto treat Alzheimer\u2019s. It was said that\nthis drug was used to boost memory\nand alertness in healthy individuals.\nAMS also acknowledged the possibility of these drugs being used\nto gain an unfair advantage in\nexaminations.\nThey are looking into using drug\ntests in the future before examinations to prevent cheating.\nFellow student newspaper, The\nBeaver at LSE, reported heavy use of\nthese so called smart drugs or noo-tropics at LSE as well. Apparently\nthe drugs are used as a substitute\nfor hard work, but also help in concentration and in extending working\nhours without the need for much\nsleep.\nFatimah Mohamied\nScience Correspondent\nArmed with telescopic hearing, Felix\nWhitton reviews astronomy podcasts\nAnt societies have individuals that\nmake decisions for the entire colony\nand so act as political leaders.\nAs in Britain, in ant kingdoms the\nqueen has only a symbolic political\nrole. Instead of the queen or some\nspecial caste making important deci-sions, well-informed individuals make\ndecisions for the entire colony, which\nthe others then follow. These leaders\neven change their minds when they\nlearn about a better course of action.\nThis flexible behaviour of the well-in-formed individuals helps ant colonies\nsurvive in time of distress and highlights how, even within this \u2018simple\u2019\nanimal species, personality may play a\ncrucial role in the survival.\nTalking at the 4th European Conference for Behavioural Biology at Dijon,\nFrance, biologist Nigel Franks from\nBristol University presented his research on ant decision makers. Franks\nand colleagues studied colonies of\nrock ants (Temnothorax albipennis)\nin the laboratory in an attempt to understand how the colonies of tens or\nhundreds of insects, make a common\ndecision about where to move when\ntheir nest is destroyed.\nResearchers already knew that rock\nants prefer dark, flat spaces with narrow entrances for their nest sites,\nquite the opposite of what a modern\nhuman may like. They also knew that,\nto inform others of a good nest site,\nrock ants lead or carry them directly\nto the new nest: the more individuals\nthat see and approve of a new nest the\nquicker, and hence safer, the move is.\nBut who makes the initial decisions to\nmove and where to go?\nTo answer these questions Franks\nand colleagues set up experiments in\nwhich two new nests were made available to an ant colony whose original\nnest was destroyed. By tagging each\nindividual with miniature ID tags, the\nsize of Queen\u2019s eyes on a pound coin,\nresearchers were able to observe who\nfinds the new nest and recruits new\nmembers to it first.\nThe results were surprising. The\nsame few individuals, the ones that\nare most physically active, but otherwise quite ordinary ants, find the new\nnests first and decide to recruit others.\nFranks said the remarkable thing is\nthat in the middle of the move, these\nsame individuals already look for other potential nest sites and if they find a\nbetter site they change their mind and\nstart recruiting to this better site. He\nadds that the same few individuals act\nas both decision makers and consen-sus-breakers and so, believe it or not,\n\u201cplay the role of political activists\u201d in\nant societies.\nDecision-making in other species\nmay differ from the model displayed\nby ant colonies. Speaking at the same\nAnt opinion leaders and political\nactivists make their views heard\nconference, Marie-Helen Pillot, a biologist from Paul Sabbatier University\nin France, said that in sheep, perhaps\nunsurprisingly, any individual that\nmoves first is followed by the others.\nIn flocks of geese, however, it appears\nthat although any group member may\nsuggest a move, only certain individuals have the authority to be followed\nby others. This is according to Amandine Ramseyer from University of\nStrasbourg in France.\nCredit: Audrey Dussutour, University of Sydney\nThe ants marching under the command of their leader.

If only\nI was lucky enough to be rubbed down by a\ngorgeous Polish blonde, instead of the Serbian\nbear currently doing it.\nScorpio\nThis week I have\nmostly been doing\nmy knitting, yes\nknitting. No it is not\njust for Grannies\nand no, I don\u2019t know\nwhy I\u2019m telling you this. Except, I know you\nwill understand. You\u2019ve always understood me,\nI honestly don\u2019t think anyone else really does.

Fortunately they haven\u2019t left\nbehind the Imperial arrogance we all love.\nSagittarius\nThis week it has\nbeen officially\ndecided that this is\nthe last Horrorscope\nto be written. What\nto say... what to\nsay... Mmm difficult. Ok, I fingered myself in\nthe ass last night. I was showering and it was\nquite soapy, I wanted to know what it would\nfeel like. Long story short, I should have taken\na dump before hand and it took a long time to\nclean up the shower... I have no dignity\nCapricorn\nThe majority of you\nfeel excluded from\nthe horoscopes.\nLuckily 60% of you\nwill be hung in Beit\nquad pirate style.\nLeaving the other 40% to hide in fear.

It\u2019s not long\nbefore the words \u201cI Egyption!?!\u201d are spoken in\nan apparently witty comment. Too bad heart\ndisease runs strong throughout the editors\nfamily.

Why the fuck is there a compulsory\nlecture about CV\u2019s? Good thing the unsuspecting lecturer is going to die of the overuse\nof crack cocaine. She shivers, but it\u2019s not\nbecause it\u2019s cold.\nThis week we said FUCK you guys, and made the horoscopes about ourselves... Enjoy\nHow to save money the Tamara way\nThe crisis has, of course, touched even\nthose of us who are financially com-fortable. Even we are thinking about\neconomising.\nEconomising on heating\nThis is incredibly simple. We lowered\nthe temperature in our guest house\nto +14 degrees. It cannot be lower\nbecause it would start to damage the\nantiques. If guests arrive we can make\nthe room comfortable in 2-3 hours but\nwhat is the point of paying for heating\nan empty house? Of course, with 800\nsquare metres like ours you\u2019re not going to save much but many people have\nmuch bigger guest houses.\nEconomising on food\nFor me this is the easiest of all limita-tions. Food is not a very big deal to me.\nHere however, there is much scope\nfor economising. First of all, I have\nasked the food stylist to be around for\nthe buying of food in Provence and\nBordeaux. Buying food here makes it\nslightly less expensive and I am more\ncertain of the quality. Secondly, I drew\nthe attention of the junior chef to\ncheaper local stores. Before, I used to\nworry about the quality but this was\nsilly. The fresh bread and local vegetables aren\u2019t too bad.\nEconomising on transport\nI almost immediately gave up on\npersonal transport. In the current situation this is a big drain on funds and\nalso a headache. To my surprise, the\nLexus turned out to be bearable. Also,\nJonny (the driver) says our LS600 us a\nvery cheap car to run. I highly recommend it, don\u2019t take that as pestering\nadvertising.\nEconomising on housing\nI have heard that many people advise\nto rent out unused property, but of\ncourse this is very tiresome and takes\na long time. For example, we\u2019ve been\ntrying to rent our properties in Chelsea for almost a month and we\u2019re really\nstruggling to find a decent realtor. I\u2019m\nhoping it will sort itself out soon. This\nshould cover the costs of keeping the\ngolf grounds and the gym decent.\nEconomising on personnel\nWith people it is the most difficult.\nYou get used to them and they become\npractically part of your family. But in a\ncrisis we must tighten our belts. I had\nto say goodbye to the groomer (hair\nstylists for the pets) and asked the food\nstylist to take care of buying food as\nwell. The curling instructor also had to\ngo, but my husband thanked him properly and I hear considerably helped his\nhome country, Iceland.\nEconomising on entertainment\nFor many this will be a huge shock, but\nI am a quiet homey person so for me it\nis not too difficult. My husband bought\na music system \u2013 Steinway Lyngdorf\nwhich has a reasonably good sound so\nnow we listen to many musicians as recordings rather than inviting them to\nour place. I couldn\u2019t help inviting Elton though to play a bit on the piano. I\ndon\u2019t like how he sings particularly but\nhis playing is wonderful.\nEconomising on hobbies\nYes yes, now I have to economise on\nthe most pleasurable things. For exam-ple, this year I decided against my idea\nof completing my collection of late impressionist paintings. This would have\nrequired too much spending. However, I found a bargain in a golden sarcophagus from the epoch of the middle\nkingdom.\nEconomising on the small things\nHere I\u2019ll repeat the time-honoured\nwisdoms. Ask the doorman to programme this system so it turns off\nlights when you leave a particular floor.\nAsk the accountant to be more careful\nwith the funds. Round all bills only to\nthe nearest thousand. Find something\nwhich has become more of a drain on\nyour health rather than a pleasure and\nsell it. My husband, for example, sold\nthe bank and I \u2013 my collection of black\ndiamonds even though I had to give\naway a percentage to the sharks from\nSotheby\u2019s.\nWith all this talk of a credit crunch and financial crisis, I asked a good friend of mine to give me some\ntips on saving the pennies during these hard times.\nIn times of need - save money on clothes\nDear Tamara,\nMy roommate\u2019s boyfriend had a go\nwhile she was in the shower. For the last\nfew weeks, when he sees me in the cor-ridor, he brushes past a little too close.\nWhen she leaves the room, he\u2019ll always\nmake a suggestive comment or two. A\nfew nights ago, he came round and as\nsoon as the door closed on her going to\nthe shower, he put hand suggestively on\nmy thigh and whispered \u201c\u201d. What do I\ndo?\nTorn.\nDear Torn,\nJudging by\nthe fact that you did not slap him in the\nfirst place, you yourself wouldn\u2019t mind\na go. Suggest the idea of a threesome to\nyour friend \u2013 tell her how much guys\nwould like you if they thought you two\ngot up to girly sausage-free slap and\ntickle. She\u2019ll soon catch on and you and\nthe guy can have guilt-free sex, just remember to remind her sometimes.\nYou\u2019ll never have to watch Heroes reruns until they take the sock off the\ndoor again.\nDear Tamara,\nMy boyfriend promised to help me write\ninto Felix about his need to talk dirtily\nabout science in bed. I sat down at my\nlaptop, ready to write to you and instead of helping, he\u2019s been on the phone\nfor the last 40 minutes to a friend from\nhis course discussing chemical reac-tions. It disturbs me because I know\nhe\u2019ll discuss the same reactions with me\nlater. Help, my sex life is at stake!\nInert gas.\nDear Inert gas,\nDoes the science talk not turn you on\njust a little bit? I admit, I find it a welcome change from the \u201cOoh baby, what\na naughty nurse you are\u201d and similar. I\nfind dressing up in a lab coat and introducing props such a blackboard and\nconical flasks into the bedroom really\nhelps me get in the mood. If this makes\nhim too hot, cool him down with some\nliquid nitrogen. May I suggest some\nphrases you can use in response?\n- Baby, have we now reached thermal\nequilibrium? - Shall we increase the\nentropy in this room? - Let\u2019s discover the resonant frequency of your\nbed! - Do you want to see my Higg\u2019s\nboson? -Tamara says: \u201cKill two birds with one cock!\u201d\nI really love scooters\nGot a problem?\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nsudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk Fun & Games\nThe winner of Slitherlink 1,411 was\nJimmy Bibby!

It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink\ngrid is by drawing crosses around any\nzeros. Drawing crosses is purely done\nto so that you know where there can\u2019t\npossibly be a line. So, take the pattern\nbelow as an example. Begin by drawing\ncrosses, then by filling in some lines:\nNow the lines can only continue in the\nfollowing directions:\nSlitherlink 1,412\n3\n2 2\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n1,411 solution\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\nTEXT US!

Clearly it\nis not Aum Shinrikyo (Japan), Babbar\nKhalsa International (India), the IRA\nor even ETA (of Spain). Will anyone\neven entertain the idea that these terrorists groups would cause trouble for\nthe author of the book (the Jewel of\nMedina)? Caz quite unashamedly has\nused conformist self-censorship, to be\nas vague as possible, to not be (seen) as\nracist, or Islamophobic, but we know\nthat it means Muslims. The implicit\nadvice to Muslims is, if you don\u2019t accept this book as a work of fiction, but\ntake offence, then you are a terrorist.\nSo much for freedom when it comes\nto issues that really matter. The BAE\ncash-for-contracts scandal, where\nthere was a genuine public interest to\nknow the facts, ended with the fraud\ninvestigation being cancelled. Tony\nBlair trumped freedom with \u201cissues of\nnational security\u201d. During Lord Levy\u2019s\ncash-for-honours questions, the courts\nstopped the BBC from making any reference to the story. In 2004, George\nGalloway won \u00a3150k libel damages\nfrom the Daily Telegraph. Justin Timberlake was awarded substantial libel\ndamages in 2003, when the News of\nWorld wrongly claimed he had cheated\non Cameron Diaz. Papers can\u2019t argue\nthat it\u2019s their \u201cfreedom to make up stories\u201d. There are many cases of near factual (not even fictional stories) made\nup about businesses and persons; and\nthere is no Freedom to make such libelous statements because they might\ncause damage or injury to the said\npersons or businesses. If, however, the\nsubject is a community, or even better\na religious group, then it\u2019s open season\nfor attacks.\nThe very author of the book, Sherry\nJones, who is quoted as saying \u201cthis is\nabout the free world, the future of de-mocracy, and the future of freedom\nof speech so I\u2019m not going to abdicate\nthat responsibility\u201d, highlights the hypocrisy of Freedom of Speech further.\nWhen the University of Texas professor Denise Spellberg negatively reviewed her book, Ms Jones demanded\nMs Spellberg retract her comments,\nsaying they are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cslanderous\u201d. Ms Jones is on record saying she\n\u201cused the most inflammatory language\n[she] could possibly have used. If you\nwant to incite heated emotions from\nany religious group you just use the\nword \u2018pornography\u2019 in the same sentence as their revered figures\u201d.\nThe hypocrisy of \u2018freedom of speech\u2019\nGilead Amit\nI\n\u2019m thinking of buying a laptop.\nNo, don\u2019t get me wrong.

But it was still a\nlittle bit strange to be left in amidst a\ngraveyard of display models, waiting\nfor help that would never come.\nStill.\nThat was fine. I didn\u2019t need help.

I explain the laptop I want and she takes\nme over to the exact fucking same \u201cfive\nhundred gigs\u201d laptop I began the crusade at.

Please allow\n3-5 days for delivery of responses.\nI\ns it evening where you are? I\ncould never handle the writer-reader timezone difference\nproperly, you see. I could go\nwith the assumption that you\u2019re\nreading this assiduously in your Friday\nmorning lectures, but that seems as\nunlikely as the assumption that you go\nto your Friday morning lectures. It\u2019s far\nmore likely that you\u2019re reading this on\nMonday afternoon, sipping your free\ncoffee in the SCR, scanning me briefly\non Tuesday morning as you walk into\nBeit quad, or lifting your exhausted\neyelids in a departmental common\nroom late on a Thursday evening. If\nthat is in fact what you\u2019re doing, try not\nto be overly spooked out. Unless your\nname is James, you have a mole behind\nyour left ear and are currently resisting\nthe urge to do something amusing with\na spoon. Stop that.\nWherever and whenever you are, attempting to cater to all of you is giving\nme a pretty bad case of emotional jet-lag. Because the time of day you read\nsomething has a significant impact on\nyour \u2018relationship with the text\u2019., to use\na pointless A-levelism. To those early\nbirds among you, good morning. If\nI\u2019ve caught you early enough, you\u2019re\nstill ensconced in your warm, protective sconces, game for some whimsical raillerie before the day\u2019s tribulations commence. For those of you at\nGMT+5 (noon, Gilead Mean Time),\nwe\u2019re playing an entirely different ball\ngame. You\u2019ve got things on your mind,\nplaces to go and deadlines to meet. If\nit\u2019s after lunch time then someone has\nprobably already had the time to annoy\nyou. You want good old-fashioned invective and a liberal dose of vitriol, accompanied with a light cliche sauce to\nassure you of the righteousness of your\nwrath. Those of you reading this in the\nevening, however, are probably looking\nfor something different.\nThe dying hours of the day are really\nremarkable. In the preceding hours the\nmind has been compressed, extended,\njumped on, forced into boxes, forced\nto extract itself from boxes, attacked,\nteased, threatened, soothed, twisted,\nnumbed and generally mistreated. It\nis, to put it simply, exhausted. The\nelectronics of the human mind have\nbeen ripped out of their sockets come\nsundown, and strange currents and\nunusual connections start to appear.\nThings make sense in the dark that\nnever made sense in the daytime and\nToo many mornings by the Albert Hall\nwill never make sense again. Ideas\nclick, phrases form, theories spring\ninto being and problems vanish. The\nevening is the best time for a writer to\nbe read at, as one doesn\u2019t have to go out\nthere to fetch the emotional reactions:\nthe hearts of the readers come to you.\nSo I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s evening, your time.\nIt\u2019s God-knows-what-time on my end -I started writing this on Tuesday morning and by the time I\u2019ve reached this\nsentence it\u2019s five o\u2019clock on a Wednesday afternoon. But let\u2019s not talk about\nme. If it is evening where you are, look\nup. No no. Stand outside and look up.\nAnd while I realize the inherent stupidity of my giving you instructions\nto look up while blatantly forcing you\nto look down, genuinely take a look at\nthe stars. Take a minute. Don\u2019t worry\nabout me. I\u2019ll wait.\nNow when was the last time you did\nthat? Don\u2019t worry \u2013 this isn\u2019t another\npanegyric about the rare beauty of the\ncosmos or an opportunity to show off\nmy knowledge of astronomy. The extent of my understanding is that if you\nlook very carefully under Orion\u2019s belt,\nyou may be able to see the Big Dipper.\nOr at least, that\u2019s what he calls it.\nNo, my central theme this week is\na microscopic one. About the size of\nAntares in the night sky. All I want to\npoint out is how easily things can get\nout of your control. To take the mundane example that has come to symbolize what I mean, there was a time\nquite recently when I saw the stars on\na regular basis. Since I arrived in London thirteen months ago, I have only\nactively searched for them on five oc-casions. Five times.\nAnd while there\u2019s nothing wrong\nwith not looking for the stars, it was a\nstrange realization to tilt my head upwards and see a pinpoint-on-black pattern that had become unfamiliar to me.\nThere. That\u2019s all I have to say. That was\nthe centre of this piece: unfortunately\nnot accompanied by Michael Palin\nwearing a dress and carrying a small\nsign. Just a small point; blink and you\u2019d\nhave missed it.\nThe reason this suddenly struck me\nwas because, over the past few weeks,\nI\u2019ve had the opportunity to see the\nMoon from a bewildering array of vantage points within throwing distance\nof the Albert Hall. No matter how often you see it, the Moon at 01:30 in\nthe morning is an ethereally beautiful\nsight. It has also pervaded our Romantic mythos to an amazing degree; and\nwhile I am of the Wodehousean belief\nthat the fact that it rhymes with \u2018June\u2019\nis largely responsible, there is no getting away from its exhilarating purity.\nA seemingly perfect white circle in a\nblack sky, reflecting all the cyclical patterns of human existence, there is no\nmystery over why the Moon is such a\nconstant feature of love songs, poems,\npaintingsandmythologies.Becausethe\nMoon is, at the end of the day, the artist\u2019s closest companion. The one face\nthat unites any creative soul desperate\nto catch the midnight wave of inspira-tion, looking on its blank expression\nout of the nearest window. The light\nwhich shines over whatever we do in\nthe godforsaken hours of the morning\nwhen we can fool ourselves into believing the world has gone to sleep, and\nthat we are alone with our talents.\nFor an object with one-sixth the value\nof Earth\u2019s gravity, it exerts an entirely\ndisproportionate attraction over us.\nAnything can be fixed/built with foam\nJellyBean\nI\nf you\u2019re a fresher you might not\nyet realize the magnitude of the\nridiculous debacle that is dealing with landlords. Indeed you\nmight well visit a flat later in the\nyear and be shocked at the mess some\nstudents live in; (don\u2019t worry: it wears\noff). But student accommodation, my\nfriends, is a beautiful, beautiful thing.\nMy personal sty has such features as:\nmultiple cupboard doors attached\nupside-down (you\u2019d better hope that\nattaching doors was a fairly simple\nprocess, or at least that having made\none mistake you\u2019d not make another)\na train and traffic powered earthquake\nsimulation feature that triggers every\nfive minutes and beds that collapse\nspontaneously alongside yellowing\nkitchen lino and dodgy plumbing (i.e.\ntoilets that flush upward).\nGreat! It is nice too to see the attempt\nto create a more homely feel with the\naddition of framed pictures on the wall,\nthough the effect is rather lost when\nyou notice the Victorian rural blacksmith scene is repeated three times\nin one room. (Actually an artsy-type\nfriend of mine pointed out that this\nwas very Campbell and was perhaps\nan inadvertent work of artistic gen-ius). My friend in the flat downstairs\nstill has a chandelier adorning the high\nornamented ceiling of his two-\u2019bed\u2019\nopen-plan kitchen left over from who-knows-when. It glares down disap-provingly, dripping with contempt and\ncut-glass globules, powerless to oust\nthe hygiene-oblivious plebeians that\nnow live there.\nAfter you get over the fact that your\nItalian landlords accept rent in cash\nonly and count it in French whilst clearly having connections to some form of\nmafia group from back home, the only\nreal issue is maintenance, (assuming of\ncourse that you managed to persuade\nthem to get you a fridge before the\nChristmas break). Most of the handymen that I have known to visit student accommodation, I suspect, don\u2019t\nactually have opposable thumbs (and\ntherefore probably don\u2019t deserve the\ntitle). One came to mend my window\nframe and a chest of drawers. When\nhe left, there was lots of mess, he had\nhammered things and removed most\nof the crinkly old paint but I swear he\nactually changed nothing. But this was\nnothing compared to what my friend\nexperienced.\nThere are mice in the kitchen, the\nstairs are a bit wonky and smoke keeps\ncoming up from the basement flat.\nWhat do you expect the \u2018handy-man\u2019\nto arrive with? A few tubes of expanding foam. Apparently, any problem can\nbe solved by a Pole with expanding\nfoam. With it you can fill up gaps in\nthe kitchen skirting board and prevent\nthe entry of mice. Fair enough, but the\nthing was that, rather than moving\nthe fridge to access the wall behind he\nsimply placed a couple of blobs either\nside of it (coming dangerously near to\nsealing the freezer door closed); as if\nmice can\u2019t climb over three inches of\nthe stuff.\nYou can also place vast quantities\naround the door frame adjoining the\nbasement and use up the excess on the\nstaircase. Of course, you must be honest about the material in use, so avoid\ntidying up the overflow with anything\nmore than a half-hearted hack with a\nStanley knife.\nThis got me thinking, is there any\nDIY problem that can\u2019t be solved with\nexpanding foam? I figured if you can\nmake furniture from nothing but the\nstuff, you can pretty much mend any-thing, right? So in the interest of pushing the boundaries of Material Science\nI gave it a go. A tube can set you back a\nsmall fortune but I was encouraged by\nthe claim that it would produce \u2018up to\nfifty times\u2019 the volume of the contents\nand I had grand ideas of a sofa, or perhaps some form of stylish coffee table\nfor a fraction of Ikea prices. Unfortunately it ran out in no time and took\nabout 24 hours to set. I was worried\nafter the promised one-hour that I had\ngot the wrong stuff because though a\nskin had formed, the two components\nof my table were about as structurally\nsounds as a half-filled bean bag. Still,\nwith a little patience the project turned\nout to be a run-away success; I own a\ncoffee table to die for made of nothing but expanding foam and a couple\nof sheets of an old felix. It\u2019s art and design at its finest. (I think I\u2019ll neglect to\nmention the fact that a couple of seconds after the photo was taken a train\nactivated the earthquake simulation\nfeature, which upset the careful balance between the pint of apple squash\nand the book and I didn\u2019t really have\nenough hands to save the library book,\nthe table itself, my camera and the\ncarpet at the same time.) So there you\nhave it, forget bits of wood, hammers,\nnails, screwdrivers and core plugs, just\nget yourself some expanding foam and\nyou\u2019re in business.\nAbdul Hannan\nAfter owning one of these, you\u2019ll never shop at Ikea again It\u2019s not easy to appreciate the beauty of the Hall when it\u2019s 9am and you\u2019re tired. So take a moment now\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n22 felix Friday 24 October 2008\nhe is adopted into a royal household in\nanother kingdom. As an adult, things\ntake a turn for the worse when Oedipus kills an elderly man one night at\na crossroads. This man, unbeknownst\nto Oedipus, was his father, the King of\nThebes. Oedipus, still unaware of his\ntrue identity, solves the riddle of the\nSphinx, winning the throne of Thebes\nand the hand of the Queen, his biological mother. With this part of the\ndestiny fulfilled, the play begins with\nthe kingdom of Thebes beset with a\n\u201cit is a play\ncharged with\na powerful\nand emotional\npoignancy\u201d\nWarning - not for the faint-hearted\nS\nopphocles\u2019 Oedipus, the ancient Greek masterpiece, is a\nplay charged with a powerful\nand emotional poignancy in\nAlex McGuiness\u2019 adaption\nat the Olivier theatre, Southbank. It is\nthe story of ill-fated Oedipus\u2019 frightening process of realising he has killed\nhis father, and bedded his mother.\nRalph Fiennes put on a terrific per-formance, starring as the naive yet\nexceptionally arrogant king. My lasting memory will be of the exquisite\nanguish of the fallen Oedipus, fist\nclenched in mouth, then curled up foe-tally as he struggles with the realisation\nof his true identity.\nFor the uninitiated, I\u2019ll begin with a\nbrief synopsis of the plot. Oedipus\u2019s\nfate is predetermined at birth by Apollo. The prophecy states he is destined\nto kill his father and bed his mother. As\na consequence, Oedipus is abandoned\nby his parents and left to die with his\nankles bound. Surviving this ordeal,\nCatherine Jones goes to the Olivier to see a merciless and gut-wrenching production of Oedipus\nplague-like curse. Oedipus the King\ncomes to the aid of his subjects, setting\nout on a mission to bring the murderer\nof the dead monarch to justice.\nFiennes played an arrogant Oedipus,\nthrowing his weight around as the autocratic leader. A good performance\nfrom Fiennes \u2013 as you would expect\nfrom an Oscar-nominated actor. My\nonly qualm was the pre-recorded howls\nofOedipus\u2019sself-mutilatingpain,losing\nauthenticity when played from an offstage amplifier. As for the supporting\nroles, Jasper Britton\u2019s Creon had boyish\ncharm reminiscent of a young Jeremy\nClarkson. Claire Higgins\u2019 Jocasta gave\nan interesting performance, highlighting the sexual tension in their sickening relationship and Teiresias, the old\nblind prophet played by Alan Howard,\nhad gravitas, with a slight Irish twang\nto his gravelly accent. Praise also goes\nout to an excellent chorus.\nThe staging was vaguely reminiscent\nof a courtroom, aptly framing Oedipus\u2019\ndetective work. Dramatic shadows\nand clever spotlighting added drama\nto the bleak and desolate stage. Sharply\ndressed in formal suits, a bald Ralph\nFiennes did look every bit the lawyer\nwhen cross-examining Teiresias and\nCreon. Perhaps the suits were a bit too\ntimely, evoking clich\u00e9d comparisons to\ndeflated Wall Street traders.\nA discussion of Oedipus is not complete without some kind of reference\nto Freud. Freud suggested the Oedipus\nmyth is poignant because it touches\non something darker in the human\npsyche, the Oedipus complex, a subconscious childhood dual desire for incest and patricide. On the surface this\nseems a very strange idea, but I think\nthere may be some truth in this. Adam\nPhilips, an eminent psychotherapist\nand author, puts this idea well in a recent interview in the Times ; \u201cAs boys\ngrowing up, most of us play this game\nof distancing our mothers and not letting them in, and inviting them in and\nbeing very needy\u201d.\nTo conclude, this is a very insightful play, and an excellent production.\nIf forced, I\u2019d give it 8 stars out of 10.\nWhy only eight? It was difficult to\nhave the stamina for the intensity of\nthe production. I left the auditorium\nexhausted. I guess Freud might claim\nit was the Oedipus complex at work in\nmy repressed subconscious. I think it\ncould have something to do with the\nomission of an interval break. Hmmm.\nMaybe let\u2019s just blame fate...\nOedipus runs until January 4th at\nthe Olivier theatre.\n\u201cI left the\nauditorium\nexhausted\u201d\nObviously this production of Oedipus contains zombies and is more gory than Saw V. Probably not as gory as Hostel, although nothing is likely to ever be.\nWork is well underway on phase two\nof the Beit Masterplan, the three phase\nproject to modernise and make better\nuse of the space in the Union Building,\nBeit Quadrangle. The first phase saw\nthe installation of a new Disability\nDiscrimination Act (DDA) compliant lift\nas well as a new 2nd floor mezzanine\nlevel chair store, changing room shells\non the 2nd floor mezzanine and 3rd floor\nand access improvements from daVinci\u2019s\nto the Quad.\nThe second phase will see the\ncompletion of the new mezzanine level\nsplitting what was the Union Gym in to\ntwo floors. The new floor created will\nbe the home of a new Student Activities\nCentre (SAC) which will provide a larger\nand better-designed space for all of\nthe Clubs & Societies to use as a base\nfor their activities. Half of the SAC will\nbe suspended from the ceiling with\nworkstations and equipment for Club &\nSociety use. The main Union Reception\nwill also be housed in this area providing\nthe first point of call for all visitors to the\nUnion. The other half of the SAC will hold\nThe Advice Centre, providing a more\nhigh profile space for our independent,\nimpartial and free advice service. When\nthe whole project is complete the space\nbelow the SAC will be the new Union\nOffices where the Sabbaticals and staff\nwill work. It is hoped that by having the\npeople that run the Union closer to the\nheartbeat of the organisation, the Clubs\n& Societies, it will help us stay more\nmember focused.\nThe space freed up from where the old\nSAC was will be used to create brand\nnew fully-equipped meeting rooms and\nClub & Society stores and in turn the\nspace where the old meeting rooms\nwere will be turned in to a state-of-the-art dance and activity space. This floor\nwill be fitted with sprung floors, mirrored\nwalls and brand new\nchanging rooms offering\na superb space for our\nClubs & Societies to use\nthroughout the year.\nSo, where are we now\nwith all this work?\nOur team of builders\nhave already made\na good start to the\nnew mezzanine level\non the second floor.\nWork is also under way\nproviding services to the new floors\nincluding networking, electricity and\nair conditioning. We are aiming to have\nall the work finished by the end of the\nSummer Term and will be completing\nthese works in phases. We will keep you\nup-to-date with what is happening in\nFelix and on our website and hope that\nany disruptions caused by these works\nwill be kept to a minimum.\nThe obvious aim of these works is to\nmake our Union Building much more\ninline with what our members, you the\nstudents, want and need from it. Having\nbeen designed and built nearly 100\nyears ago, with additions made in the\n1950s, the demands on it have changed\nmassively; something that will be\naddressed during this project.\nunionpage\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nUnion Building Redevelopment Update\nThe Union Building before the additional floors were added\nArtists impressions of the new Student Activities Centre\nOur new and improved evening menu.\nAvailable from 17:00 - 21:00 across the Union.\nChoose from a fantastic selection of snacks, pizzas and main courses, order at the bar\nand we will bring the food to your table once it is cooked!\nCheck our website to see the full menu.\nHAVE YOU TRIED?\n\n"

Oriental Canteen or\nLittle Japan near the South Ken\ntube for similar oriental grub.\nPrice: \u00a35\nRichard Lai\nfor just \u00a35, we weren\u2019t surprised to see\na fair number of diners there, although\nthe size of the tables was overkill \u2013 on\naverage only about three to four people were sat on each ten-seater table.\nIf anything, it felt like we were eating\nin a prison dining hall. It\u2019s fair enough\nthat they were trying to bring in the\nlayout of a typical Chinese restaurant,\nbut anyone with common sense would\nhave used tables of different sizes \u2013\npreferably a combination of four and\nsix-seaters. Another immediate letdown was the fact that there were no\nchopsticks \u2013 instead they had pairs of\nlollipop sticks which you link together\nat the top. Even a Chinaman like me\nstruggled with those vessel-blocking\nblades, let alone students from the rest\nof world.\nI\nwas getting worried. It was October and the trees were still\ngreen. Bloody global warming, I\nthought. Thankfully, this week I\nwas greeted by tree confetti eve-rywhere! Yippee, my favourite season\nof the year \u2013 Autumn. It\u2019s that time\nof the year when it\u2019s so cold and dry\nyour cheeks start to go rosy, and you\nfinally have an excuse for stuffing your\ngob with warming soups, stews and\ncrumbles.\nSpeaking of stuffing your face, have\nany of you come across the \u201chot, new\nchef\u201d on the tellybox, Valentine Warner? I have fallen in love with his toffish,\nspacky face. It\u2019s refreshing to see someone getting stuck into piles of good,\nhearty food \u2013 I got sick of watching\nNigella making eyes at the camera and\nhaving an orgasm at every mouthful of\nher creations.\nAnyway, I recommend you watch\nsome of his shows on the BBC iPlayer,\nif only for the comedy value of his public school tones extolling the virtues\nof shooting wild game. Rah-rah-rah.\nBrilliant.\nUnfortunately for my belly and arter-ies, this week my boyfriend decided he\nwanted to turn from Physicist to Pastry Chef and proceeded to run riot in\nthe kitchen making pasties and tortes\nleft, right and centre! Consequently I\nhave included two relatively healthy,\nyet filling dinner recipes to ease my\nconscience. Please do give them a go.\nI know it\u2019s hard getting out of that hole\nof Chicken Tonight and frozen pies but\nit\u2019s a lot brighter outside.\nThis week in the Food section, I also\nbring an alternative to the overpriced\nmuck we have here at college. If you\nare lucky enough to have your parents\nbuy your lunch, or if you happen to be\na member of staff, you may be able to\nafford lunch at one of the gastropubs in\nthe surrounding area.\nThe ever-enthusiastic Lucy Harrold\nhas battled her way through a plate of\nbambi-meat sausages for your delight,\nreader. I like to think gastropubs aren\u2019t\nthe evil, corporate whorehouses that\nwe often mistake them for. They are\npurely trying to put local, hearty, fresh-ly-cooked meals in front of you\u2026 for a\nslightly elevated price, sure. If I had the\nmoney, I would love to eat there more\noften but you can cook about the same\nthing for less than half the price and\ndouble the effort at home. Such is life!\nIf you do decide you can\u2019t be arsed\nstretching your legs to find a decently-priced lunch outside college, why not\ntry the Chinese Buffet in the MDH?\nTo help you make your mind up, read\nRichard Lai\u2019s critique on the college\u2019s\nlatest venture. From reading Richard\u2019s\ntake on the buffet, I despair further\nabout the quality of food at IC. Is a\nplate of tasty, filling, wholesome food\ntoo much to ask? If the college cares so\nmuch about our welfare, why not start\ntackling the problem with the simple\nquestion of nutritious, cheap food?\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the question of water. Imperial College is like a\nfucking desert when it comes to potable H2O. Answers on a postcard.\nfor some reason) and prawn crack-ers, which can\u2019t possibly go wrong.\nBut what confused us was the bowl\nof french fries next to the chow mein.\nFine, let it be a small element of the\nChinese/fish-and-chips hybrid takea-way shop. Further down the aisle they\nalso served chicken wings in sweet soy\nsauce; my childhood favourite.\nThings started to look grim when\nwe moved on to the pool of chicken in\nblack bean sauce. Frankly what made\nit just slightly better than Paper Tiger\u2019s (just down the road near the Tube\nstation; NOT recommended) was the\ngreater meat content. Our hope increased as we approached the spring\nrolls and the Thai fishcakes, only to be\ngreatly disappointed. Even the takea-way shops know that spring rolls are\nnot made out of mushy vegetables\nwrapped in deep fried socks. Seriously,\nwe really couldn\u2019t find any fish in the\nso-called \u201csalmon fishcake\u201d. If Wetherspoon\u2019s burgers (which are OK) could\nmake Gordon Ramsay puke, our IC\nspring rolls, and fishcakes, could probably put the great chef into a coma, and\nJamie Oliver would actually murder\nsomeone.\nLuckily, the \u201crestaurant\u201d did provide\nunlimited jasmine tea along with Chinese teapots and cups, which my poor\nfriend and I consumed plenty of, to dilute the crap inside us.\nI don\u2019t know if the buffet is a permanent catering service but, either way,\ndo take our advice: save the fiver for a\nbonsai plant or a lucky bamboo plant\ninstead \u2013 they won\u2019t kill you.\n\u201cThou shall hev a fishy on a little dishy\u201d\nServes 2 fat bastards or 3 skinny cows\nCost: Approximately \u00a36 all together\nWe should all eat more fish. This stew is the quickest, simplest and\ntastiest way to cook it and it\u2019ll keep you warm on these cold London\nnights, like a big fishy hug in a bowl. Feel free to adapt the fish/cab-bage/veg combo as you see fit but please make sure your fish is MCS\n(Marine Conservation Standard) certified as it means they come from\nsustainable habitats. A happy fish means a happy stew. If you\u2019re not\nsure, ask the nice man on the Sainsburys/Asda fish counter.\nIngredients:\n1 tbsp oil\n1 onion, chopped\n1 leek, sliced\n2 garlic cloves, crushed\n1tsp cumin\n1 tsp paprika (add more if you like it hot)\n100g squid rings or other seafood (optional)\n1x 400g tin tomatoes\n\u00bd a tin of chickpeas (use the rest for hummous!)\n\u00bd savoy cabbage or 1 head of pak choi with the leaves removed\nA large white fish fillet (350g) cut in half for a 2 person serving\nLemon wedges, parsley and chunky bread to serve\nFry the onion, leek and garlic in oil on medium heat until transparent.\nAdd your seafood, spices and chickpeas. Turn up the heat and cook\nfor 2 minutes with stirring. Tip in the tin of tomatoes then fill the empty\ntin half full with water and put that in too! Bring to the boil then taste\nthe mixture. Add seasoning appropriately. Stir in the cabbage or pak\nchoi. Place the fillets of fish on top of the stew and cover the pan. This\nwill allow the steam from the stew to cook the fish so make sure the\nlid fits snugly. Steam for 8-10 minutes. To check the fish is cooked the\nflesh should flake away easily from the skin. Dish up into bowls or deep\nplates and serve sprinkled with parsley and with a squeeze of lemon...\nDaddy dearest, take me to...\n...the Prince Regent on Gloucester Road, it serves up top grub\nimportantly) was next to a radiator!\nThe pub appeared to be inhabited by\nbusiness parties and groups of profes-sors, including a few of my own lectur-ers. This prompted a mortifying situation when you see a teacher outside of\nschool, you just have to hide anywhere\nyou can! Oh the shame!\nNot only was the menu as advertised\noutside, but as it was between 12 and 3,\nthe lunchtime \u20182 courses for \u00a310\u2019 deal\nwas also available. Dad opted for this,\nchoosing chicken livers with bacon\nand rocket, whilst Mum and I picked\nthe venison sausages with sweet potato\nmash and redcurrant jus. We had to\nwait a little while for the food to arrive,\nbut the dishes were freshly prepared\nin the open kitchen, from which we\ncould see sporadic bursts of flames\nappearing.\nThe presentation was basic but effec-tive. I don\u2019t like all this faff that makes\nyour plate look so huge that you can\u2019t\nmanage it all. The bambi-meat sausages had an ideal texture and flavour:\nnot so rough that it feels like sawdust\nin your mouth, but not so smooth that\nyou know there isn\u2019t much meat in\nthere. The sweet potato mash was light\nand creamy and had the flavour of the\nredcurrant jus which finished the plate\nThe Prince Regent HHHHK\n25 Gloucester Road\nPhone: 020 7589 0905\nwww.theprinceregentglouces-terroad.co.uk\nBest: Tasty pudding and enormous sausages\nWorst: The price - a few pounds\nmore than the same food at the\nQueens Arms\nGo for...: The 2 courses for \u00a310\nseems like good value but the\nportions are a bit small.\nPrice: \u00a39.50 for mains - somewhere to drag the parents to!\nLucy Harrold\noff nicely. I do like \u2018jus\u2019 even if it is a little pretentious and all you northerners\nare going to tell me it\u2019s just gravy! Dad\u2019s\nplate of livers, although very tasty, was\nrather on the diminutive side. But that\nwas fine as it meant he could finish off\nthe huge sausages we couldn\u2019t manage!\nAfter our mains, the nice blonde\nwaitress then informed us that the pana\ncotta advertised on the set menu had\nall been eaten. Instead we were offered\nsticky toffee pudding; Dad\u2019s face lit up!\nThe pudding was sat in a sea of delicious butterscotch sauce and topped\nwith a very posh looking vanilla ice\ncream. It was light and not too sweet.\nA perfect end to the meal.\nThe Prince Regent is definitely one of\nthose places to take the parents when\nthey say \u201cwe\u2019re coming up to London,\nlet\u2019s do lunch\u201d. Although \u00a310 for two\ncourses isn\u2019t too pricey, it\u2019s definitely\nnot student pricing. In addition, the\nportion sizes on this deal are miniscule,\ncompared to the other main courses\noffered around the \u00a310 mark. So if\nyou are after a filling meal but aren\u2019t\ntoo fussed about how many courses it\ncomes in, just go for a large main.\nServes 2 rugby players or 3 ballet dancers\nCost: Approximately \u00a36 all together\nThis lovely autumnal salad has seasonal butternut squash in it. Alternatively if you can be arsed peeling and scooping out a pumpkin,\nuse that instead. I could eat this salad all day long. It\u2019s so moreish\nand healthy too! It requires some store cupboard ingredients like bal-samic vinegar; which is useful to have around, just like emergency\ncontraception. Remember, the tomatoes are good for your sperm,\nboys. Enjoy, my pretties!\nIngredients:\n1 butternut squash, peeled, scooped and cubed\n1 pack of cherry tomatoes\n1 head of lettuce (it\u2019s cheaper than those wanky bags of salad)\n2 chicken breasts, chopped (buy it from a butcher for super cheapness \u2013 supermarkets rip you off)\n2 rashers of bacon, cut into bits\n25g sunflower seeds\nDressing:\n1 tbsp each of honey, balsamic vinegar and mustard\n2 tbsp water\nPre-heat your oven to 200\u00b0C. Put your cubed squash onto a baking\ntray and bake in the oven. After 15 minutes add all the tomatoes to the\ntray and put it all back in the oven for another 10 minutes. When the\ntomatoes are in the oven, start cooking the meat. In a large pan, fry the\nchicken and bacon for 10 minutes. While that\u2019s cooking, start piling the\nsalad leaves onto plates. When the bacon has coloured, add the sunflower seeds to the pan and stir it all together, so that the seeds pick up\na lovely salty flavour from the bacon. Check the chicken is cooked then\npile the meat mixture on top of the salad leaves. Keep the pan to one\nside \u2013 you\u2019ll need it for the dressing. Take the veg out of the oven and\npile that on top of the meat too. If you keep piling the salad will eventually sag a bit, so you can get it all on. To make the warm dressing, put\nall the dressing ingredients into the pan used for the meat. Turn up the\nheat and boil for a few seconds. Then, pour over your salad. You have\nbefore you a tower of salady, protein-y joy. Salads aren\u2019t for fairies.\nSquashed Chicken Salad\nSpicy Fish Stew\n\u201cOur IC spring\nrolls would\nprobably put\nGordon Ramsay\nin a coma!\u201d\nHaving said that, it\u2019s the food that\nultimately determines how long a restaurant can last for. We didn\u2019t have\nhigh expectations from a \u00a35 buffet,\nand my friends know that I\u2019m picky\nwith food most of the time, but even\na regular \u2018Chinese take-awayer\u2019 would\ncringe at what our so-called catering\nteam served.

All rights reserved.\nNo progress for\nPalestinian student\nWith a month of term passed already,\nand little progress being made by the\nInternational Office, it is looking highly unlikely that Zohair Abu Shaban, the\nPalestinian student who was denied\npassage out of Gaza, will be taking up\nhis place to do an Electrical Engineering masters at Imperial.\nWhen felix first published this story on\nthe 10th of October, a buzz of activity\nwithin the student body and the College seemed to provide a little bit of\nhope for a solution to his predicament.\nMembers of IslamicSoc were organising together, by email, to formulate an\naction plan that included circulating a\npetition around the student body and\ndistributing leaflets to raise awareness.\nHowever this was nipped in the bud by\nNida Harwood, Islamic Society VP, in\nfavour of waiting \u201cto see what the university does\u201d. This delay in action occured after lengthy consultation with\nDeputy President Education and Welfare Hannah Theodorou.\nFelix spoke to the International Office this week in an effort to discover\nwhether waiting for College\u2019s lead was\nan intelligent action plan. The International Office declined to provide\nany specific information on his case.\nDr Piers Baker, Director of the International Office said \u201cit\u2019s not under our\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\ncontrol and so it\u2019s not appropriate for\nme to comment on this specific case\u201d.\nGiven the notable absence of Zohair\nAbu-Shaban at Imperial, it is clear that\nthe College has been unable to make\nany progress.\nIt would appear that Zohair AbuShaban will have to put off his dreams\nfor at least another year.\nThe College\u2019s Honorary Graduates\nAfonso Campos invites you to question the true meaning of being an Honorary Graduate or Fellow as\nhe takes a look at the past recipients of this award\nH\nonorary degrees have\nbeen offered since the\nmiddle ages to figures\nthat a university supposedly deems worthy\nenough, or has somehow ruled judgement that they have contributed significant amounts to either society as\na whole or a field of academic or non-academic life.\nAs far as records go, Imperial has\nbeen offering either Honorary Doctorates or Fellowships of the College since\n1932.\nWhile a lot of those awarded their\nhonours have, without a shadow of\na doubt been leaders in their respective fields and instigators of change\nand advancement of society, questions\nmay be raised about the reasoning\nbehind some of these doctorates and\nfellowships.\nWe have seen Imperial award them\nto great minds such as Dennis Gabor,\nNobel Laureate and founder of Holography, and Dame Carol Black, President of the Royal College of Physicians,\nmember of the GMC and President of\nthe British Lung Foundation, amongst\nother insurmountable posts.\nAs Lord Kerr elegantly put it is during this year\u2019s Graduation Ceremony,\nsome of the recipients have been the\nones \u201chonouring us\u201d by accepting our\noffer.\nIt is understandable that universities must do what they can in order\nto raise their profiles globally and increase sources of donation. It is not\nunderstandable however that some of\nthe people to whom the College confers what is by many considered to be\nthe apogee of qualifications to personalities who are just plain wealthy. Our\nuniversity is a world leader in scientific\nresearch and it is almost expected that\nall who are graced with these \u2018prizes\u2019\nbe those who have made significant\ndifference to the fields which Imperial\nhas deeply been involved in since its\nfounding.\nBy artificially widening their alumni\nbase to the \u00fcber-rich, College is more\nlikely than not hoping to reap some financial benefits in the form of future\ndonations from these graduates, despite their links to this institution being absolutely minimal if existent at all.\nA high number of philanthropists and\nindustry magnates such Ratan Tata,\nchairman of the Tata Group or Mrs\nLily Safra, a born-rich socialite have\nbeen awarded these Imperial honours.\nIt leaves one to ponder if academia has\nbecome so competitive for funding\nthat institutions are almost having to\nthrow away their pride (and sometimes\nshame) in an attempt to stay ahead of\nthe money-raising game.\nInstitutions of higher education are\nbecoming quite similar to places such\nas Hollywood \u2013 trying to secure stars\nand celebrities in an attempt to boost\nfuture earnings.\nThe model is used by many indus-tries, but it somehow spoils the purity of academia and demeans the\npast Honorary Graduates and Fellows\nwhom despite not being extravagantly\nrich, have truly and whole-heartedly\ndeserved what they have been given.\nWhile in some ways treating learning institutions like corporations can\nbe healthy, it is not the way forward\nfor increasing endowments. If Imperial is ever going to come even close to\nmatching Harvard or Yale\u2019s financial\nsuccess, it must instil in its students an\nincredible sense of pride and belonging\nto their alma mater.\nSir William Castell is the current\nChairman of the Wellcome\nTrust \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most\nprominent human and animal\nhealth improvement charities.\nThe fund has committed to invest\ncirca \u00a34 billion over the course of\nthe next four years. He was also\nthe Chief Executive Officer for\nAmersham, leading the company\nto become a major player in\nthe medical diagnostics and life\nsciences arena.\nFurthermore, his commitment\nled him to taking up the post of\nPresident and CEO of GE Healthcare \u2013 yet another massively influential and visible company in the\nhealth sector. Sir William serves\nas a non-executive Director of BP\nand is a prominent advisor in the\nPrime Minister\u2019s Business Council\nfor Britain.\nNot forgetting his altruist side,\nhe has helped revitalise areas of\nBritain plagued by social exclusion\nand unemployment. He also took\nOne Management. He has built a\ngigantic empire based on it and\ncreated what is arguably the most\nwatched sport on TV, enjoyed by\nwell over half a billion spectators\neach time the event is on.

The first instances of\ncheese predate recorded\nhistory, and in our modern age there are literally thousands\nof different varieties, ranging from\norganically crafted French farmhouse\nmasterpieces to inorganically emulsified mass-produced Americanized\nKraft squares. In English slang, the\nword \u2018cheesy\u2019, although not etymologically related to the foodstuff, has come\nto be associated with the latter case \u2013\ncheaply produced, homogenised, poor\nquality, unconvincing kitsch.\nWhen the word is applied to mu-sic, one of two things can be implied.\nThe first is a kind of charming golden-ageism; music which predates the age\nof sociological cynicism, when Dion &\nthe Belmonts played out from the jukebox into a milkshake-drenched Happy\nDays scene. The second is a bastardisa-tion of the first. It is applied to music\nwhich is kitsch beyond the point of\ngood-taste, when the so-bad-it\u2019s-good\nmentality throws off the chains of sub-tlety, only to realise that after the ironic\nsmiles and eye-rolling of the self-con-sciously jaded are gone, all that\u2019s left is\ngluttonous overindulgence.\nIn recent years, this second definition has given identity to the quasi-genre of \u2018cheese music\u2019, encompassing\nthe charts music of one\u2019s early youth\nin addition to particularly tasteless\nand bizarre examples from the music\nof today. It has always been around in\nnameless form, albeit subversively - a\nfew chosen corkers being played at the\nend of a party, much to the dismay of\nthe listeners, and much to the players\u2019\namusement. It was the naming and\nclassification of this ad-hoc grouping which gave it a kind of social ac-ceptance; admitting to \u2018loving\u2019 cheese\nmusic stopped being funny, and was\ntaken seriously. A falsehood, repeated\nenough times, was eventually accepted\nas the truth.\nStudent nights in particular have\nbeen swept up by this changing of the\nmusical guards. Being a demographic\ncomprised of such a diverse mix of\npeople whose tastes mirror this eclecticism means that we are not aligned\nto any particular musical scene, and\nthe organisers of such events, in trying\nto find a compromise, often settle for\nthe music which the majority will not\nbe offended or confused by. However,\nwhat has started as the safe decision\nseems to have become a tyranny of\ntaste, whereby cheese is often the only\nmusic which it is acceptable to play\nat student nights, including many of\nthose hosted at Imperial College.\nThis situation has been the case for\nmany years, and I have not written\nanything about it until now because I\nhave not had any hope that they could\nchange into something which could\nbe taken seriously. However with the\nrecent makeover of Da Vinci\u2019s into\nsomething which looks like a pretty\ncool place to be, it is not inconceivable\nfor Imperial to have some genuinely\ngood events - all that is needed is for\nThe Union to stop pretending to be so\nironic and play some music that people\ncan genuinely enjoy.\nSo Iceland\u2019s financial situation has apparently become so bad that the entire\nnation was recently put up for auction on ebay.com with a starting bid of\nonly 99p (Bj\u00f6rk, unfortunately, not in-cluded). Though economic woes have\nrecently pushed the country into the\nheadlines, Iceland is of course much\nmore famous for its vibrant and eccentric music scene. M\u00fam, Valgeir\nSigur\u00f0sson, Emiliana Torrini, Amiina,\nSigur R\u00f3s, The Sugarcubes \u2013 the list\ngoes on and on, making it seem like\nevery second person in this tiny nation\nis either a fisherman or a musician. Extending that list is composer and producer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, and while\nhis music might be more classical and\nstately than that of those aforementioned artists, it is by no means any less\ncaptivating.\n\u2018Fordlandia\u2019s title track starts the album on a note so gentle that it might\ntake you a minute to realise the soft\nsighsofJ\u00f3hannsson\u2019sstrings,butthey\u2019re\nthere and they\u2019re utterly gorgeous and\nthey sweep out a circular theme that\nswells the piece into a thirteen minute-plus epic. These strings are joined by\nbrass and other orchestral elements\nalong with skittering electronic percussion and if Matthew Cooper eased\nup on the synthetic arrangements, this\nis what Eluvium would probably sound\nlike.\nSupposedly the second in a planned\ntrilogy based on the influence of technology and American brands (the first,\n\u2018IBM 1401, A User\u2019s Manual\u2019, was a\neulogy to the computer of the same\nname), \u2018Fordlandia\u2019s organic heart pulsates with the aid of some very clever\nand subtle electronic processing. On\n\u2018Fordlandia \u2013 Aerial View\u2019, a restrained\nand despondent string quartet floats\nabove muted bass rumbles, an effect\n\u201cOut in the streets you won\u2019t survive\nwith wack-ass beats.\u201d So says the mythical MF Doom, close friend, confidant\nand multi-time collaborator of Dwight\nFarrell, AKA Count Bass D. With his\nlatest LP L7, CBD is less concerned\nwith survival than with evolution, his\nself-imposed isolation within the music industry proving to be a continued\ncatalyst for a mental progression of hiphop in a direction anti-parallel to the\nmainstream of the industry, and even\northogonal to the sub-genre of under-ground, \u2018left-field\u2019 hip-hop. Count Bass\nD is an anomaly - an individual, self\ncontained musical entity.\nProtection of personal freedom\nseems to be the source of his isolationism and the theme of a lot of his lyrics.\nFreedom from contractual obligations,\nfreedom from hostile influence both in\nhislifeandhismusic.Thisattitudegives\nhis music a distinctive flavour, which is\nentirely of his own creation. This is not\nto say his latest record is totally unin-fluenced by other artists \u2013 there would\nbe no music if there were no musical\ninfluences, rap music in general being\nparticularly heavy in the throwbacks\nwith its extensive use and reuse of\nsamples and beats - but his influences\nare all intentional. They come from\nthe same places as where his passions\nlie \u2013 gospel, funk, soul (his last.fm profile says he\u2019s listened to Marvin Gaye\u2019s\nHere My Dear 77 times). There are elements of classic jazz in the format of a\nlot of the songs which take a very relaxed and liberal attitude to structure,\nfavouring instead a kind of organic\ntextural development, not quite on the\nIn the great Gwen Stefani/No Doubt\ntradition, Jenny Lewis has ditched her\nRilo Kiley band mates in favour of going solo. She has also, somewhat alarm-ingly, ditched their indie rock style for\nsomething a little more country and\nwestern. On her first album, Rabbit\nFur Coat, she was billed alongside The\nWatson Twins but her latest effort,\nAcid Tongue, is by her alone. I booked\nto see Jenny Lewis live before I\u2019d listened to Acid Tongue \u2013 a risky move\ngiven I hadn\u2019t been too impressed by\nRabbit Fur Coat \u2013 given that it would\nbe the next best thing to seeing Rilo\nKiley (who last year cancelled the gig I\nhad tickets for, damn them!). So I was\npleased by how impressive the new\nalbum was and arrived at KOKO with\nmuch anticipation.\nThe support act Benji Hughes was\npretty good as support acts go, if you\u2019re\ninto very hairy fat men with voices so\ndeep the words slur into one. He also\nstumbled on to the stage a few times\nduring the main set for the occasional\nbacking vocal contribution. The venue\nwas filled to capacity even before Benji\ntook to the stage, with an unexpectedly\nhigh proportion of older music lovers.\nLater on, during the main set, I was\nbewildered to have two women easily\nin their 60s push past to stand in front\nof me. Old lady smell is not something\nyou expect to experience going to a\ngig. I can only imagine that the older\ncrowd were keen country music fans\nintrigued by new talent.\nLewis herself succeeded in being\nkooky enough to make sense in the\ncontext of KOKO, wearing a circus\nmaster jacket and high-waisted dungarees that couldn\u2019t have worked on\nOK, technically Jenny Lewis, former front-femme of Rilo Kiley, but I couldn\u2019t resist\nthe alliteration. felix\u2019s friend Emily Wilson headed to Koko to check her out\nanybody else, with a black felt hat on\na long mane of messy hair she apparently hadn\u2019t bothered to comb be-forehand. She managed to combine a\nlaid-back dippiness with commanding\nstage presence, added to her indescribable vocal talent.\nOn the whole most of the songs came\nfrom Acid Tongue, but early on a rendition of \u201cThe Charging Sky\u201d revealed\nthat Rabbit Fur Coat was not to be ne-glected, and did manage to improve\nthe album in my eyes. The clear highlight of the night was \u2018The Next Messiah\u2019, also arguably the best track on the\nnew album. If I had to recommend just\none Jenny Lewis track, I\u2019d tell you to\ncheck out this one. It was spectacular\nlive, and stunned me both with Jenny\u2019s\nastounding voice and the also the backing instruments. But also very very\ngood were \u2018Jack Killed Mom\u2019, which I\ndon\u2019t see how anybody could listen to\nand resist the urge to tap a foot at the\nvery least, even though Jenny Lewis in\nno way offers music that is very dance-able. Also, \u2018See Fernando\u2019, which saw\nJenny up on top of her piano. One\nsong I was less impressed by live was\n\u2018Carpetbaggers\u2019. On the album this is a\nduet with Elvis Costello and one of my\nfavourite tracks, but without Costello\nbeing involved it wasn\u2019t quite as good.\nI also didn\u2019t think much of \u2018Bad Man\u2019s\nWorld\u2019, which was boring on CD and\nnot much better in the flesh.\nDespite appearing as a solo artist,\nthis show would have been nothing\nwithout the bunch of talented and im\u201cthere was\nmuch audience-muttered debate\nas to the gender\nof the drummer\u201d\npressively flexible musicians appearing\nalongside Lewis. The same musicians\nappear on the Acid Tongue recordings,\nand include Lewis\u2019s long-haired guitarist boyfriend Jonathan Rice. I noted\nthere was much audience-muttered debate as to the gender of the drummer,\nlater introduced as Barbara Gruska.\nIt\u2019s always a good sign when you go\nhome and the music is even better to\nlisten to than it was before. Overall, this\nis one of the best gigs I\u2019ve been to this\nyear - Jenny Lewis managed to sway\nnot only me, but a whole audience of\npeople who arrived with a \u201cwould rather have seen Rilo Kiley\u201d attitude.\nsame level as the total structural decomposition of the post-rock kind, but\ncertainly as close as hip-hop can get. J\nDilla also, whose name is mentioned in\nvirtually all discussions on contemporary hip hop, is definitely a source of\ninspiration also, him and CBD both\nfavouring MPC cut-and-slice sampling\ntechniques. The list of influences is\nextensive, but it\u2019s the way they are digested and assimilated by CBD which\nthat\u2019s akin to being buffeted by high\nturbulent winds while making Fordlandia (Henry Ford\u2019s disastrous Amazonian rubber plantation \u2013 thank you\nonce again, Wikipedia), sound like one\nAlbum Review\nCount Bass D\nL7\n1320 Records\nHHHII\nAlbum Review\nJ\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson\nFordlandia\n4ad\nHHHHH\nMusic for your mind and music for your soul\nAn album review duplex from opposite sides of the music spectrum: J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson and Count Bass D\n\u201ca restrained\nand despondent\nstring quartet\nfloats above\nmuted bass\nrumbles\u201d\nvery bleak, melancholic place. The sadness continues with the organ requiem\nof \u2018Chimaerica\u2019, a track that becomes\neven more funereal as ever loudening,\nelectronic shuffling threatens to shatter the piece and throw it down a deep,\ndark abyss.\nIt all sounds rather heavy, and the\nfact that this is essentially a concept\nalbum means that the threat of pretentiousness is always hidden behind the\nnext ridiculously long track title (\u2018Melodia (Guidelines For A Propulsion\nDevice Based On Heim\u2019s Quantum\nTheory)\u2019, anyone?). Luckily, J\u00f3hannsson largely lets the music do the talking and all the press release guff about\ndoomed utopias, dead Greek gods and\ncrippled German physicists isn\u2019t absolutely necessary to know in order to\nenjoy the beauty of these eleven tracks.\nPart of why it all works so well is down\nto J\u00f3hannsson\u2019s restraint as a composer and even as it sometimes sounds\nlike an orphaned movie soundtrack,\nhe never succumbs to Hollywood\nsentimentality, nor does he overuse\nthemes \u2013 something which marred the\notherwise elegiac beauty of his debut\nEngleb\u00f6rn.\nFrom the quietly propulsive \u2018Rocket\nBuilder (Io Pan!)\u2019, to the Howard Shoreesque choral work on the \u2018The Great\nGod Pan Is Dead\u2019, Fordlandia remains\nintimate and absorbing. J\u00f3hannsson\nhas yet again succeeded in making another masterful record, one that opens\nup and becomes richer the more you\nlisten to it. I can only hope that dodgy\neconomics won\u2019t push him out of his\nday job.\nkeeps the sound so unique.\nAll music with such an overt shunning of contemporary sources risks\ninaccessibility, and this album is no\nexception, occasionally straying into\nabstraction and tracks which, for the\nregular listener (as opposed to the hiphop connoisseur) can be confusing and\nsomewhat unpalatable. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\ndue to some cocaine-drenched overindulgence on CBD\u2019s part, it\u2019s merely the\ninevitable consequence of stubbornness in the face of the predominate\ndirection of the music industry. His\nopinions on the industry as a whole are\nmade clear on the track \u2018Y.B.A Square\u2019,\nwhich features a vocal sample of some\u201c...not quite\non the same\nlevel as the\ntotal structural\ndecomposition\nof the post-rock kind, but\ncertainly as close\nas hip-hop can\nget.\u201d\none talking about its total corruption\nand money-orientated direction, over\nsome laid back but complex sample-work. This sentiment is admirable, and\nit is precisely this which will make this\nalbum for some an attention grabbing,\ninteresting, thought provoking listening experience, but I think the point\nwill be all too easily missed by a lot of\nlisteners.\nI\u2019ve had to bite the bullet of realism\nand give this album three stars, but it\ndoesn\u2019t particularly do it justice, and\nit is not particularly accurate. For a lot\nof listeners this album will be worth\na one, but a sizeable minority, myself\nincluded, would give it four or five \u2013\nthree is just the average. I personally\nfound this a great release from one of\nhip-hop\u2019s few true innovators, and\nwould definitely recommend this to\nanyone wanting to know hip-hop\u2019s full\npotential as a creative, uncommercial-ised genre.\nCount Bass D wearing a keyboard\nJ\u00f3hannsson is known for spending 18 hours a day in photo booths\nCount Bass D surrounded by fucking musical equipment and shit\nJenny Lewis enjoys apples\nJenny Lewis plays live somewhere.

Brought\nto you by the co-creators of Fabric, it\nhosts mixed gig and club nights, luring club-goers out of central London\nwith massive headline acts, such as the\nmighty Hot Chip. Matter is a bit of an\nout-of-town club superstore.\nMuch hyped, judging by the Fresher\u2019s week leaflet campaign, the club\nlaunched on September 18th, starting with a series of mixed indie/dance\nnights, all falling under the ironic title\nof \u201cThis is Not London\u201d. Previous attendees range from dance favourites,\nSimian Mobile Disco and Armand Van\nHelden, to indie\u2019s Reverend and the\nMakers and Mystery Jets.\nLast Saturday, Matter hosted Moshi\nMoshi Records\u2019 10th birthday party.\nMoshi Moshi Records are a Londonbased indie label, with a large array of\ntalent, including Bloc Party, on their\nbooks. The party featured a strong line\nup; Hot Chip, Kate Nash, and Florence\nand the Machine, amongst others.\nIt was a successful night overall, attracting a hip indie crowd. Headliners\nHot Chip played a storming live set,\nthe fantastic sound system doing justice to their talented percussion sec-tion. A moshing/dancing combination\nwas evident on the packed dance floor.\nElsewhere, James Yulli was a particular\nfavourite in Room Two.\nMatter, on first impressions, seemed\nstark, sleek and kind-of-cool. Proportioned on an industrial scale, Matter\nlooks very much like a warehouse. The\ninteriors: smooth concrete, lit dramatically with coloured neon light. It has a\ncinematic quality, evocative of a futuristic sci-fi film.\nThe main room is very impressive\nboth architecturally and technically.\nThe sound quality was excellent, with\nstunning visual projections on either\nside of the stage. Those avoiding the\ndownstairs can congregate around\nthe upper floor balconies, still with\nan excellent view of the stage. If your\nstomach is strong enough, the best\nviews in the house are on the precari-ous-looking Indiana Jones style bridge,\nsuspended 50m above the dance floor.\n(This is prime pulling territory).\nOverall, the phrase \u201ctotal design\u201d\nsprings to mind. The sheer care taken\nover design is evident, using innovative technology to enhance the dance\nfloor. The idea is, by pumping out\ncertain bass frequencies to your feet\nthrough speakers embedded in the\ndance floor, you feel a stronger urge to\ndance, as your brain\u2019s perception involves processing vibrational information too .\nAlso worth a mention are the generous bar and toilet facilities. The bars\nand the bar staff were so numerous, you\ncould just nonchalantly stroll over and\norder a drink at your leisure. Drinks\nwere reasonably priced. \u00a34 for a spirit\nand mixer is not too outrageous.\nThe catch; getting there was by no\nmeans straightforward. Tedious would\nbe a polite description.\nWith the tube shut for engineering\nwork, we chose to travel the fabulous\nway, taking the special Thames Clipper\nservices to the O2. Or so we thought,\nforgetting that in London you can never rely on public transport. Imagine\nour dismay on arriving at the pier, on\ntime, as planned, only to find the only\nboat in the vicinity was a party boat.\nKaraoke was in full swing, trashed\nparty guests singing along to the Dirty\nDancing soundtrack. After much con-fusion, and time wasted, Waterloo pier\nprevailed. The Thames clipper journey\nwas beautiful, as you might expect,\nand worth a trip in its own right. As a\ntransport form though, it\u2019s too extravagant at \u00a35/\u00a36 each way (Oyster is not\naccepted).\nThe most disappointing aspect of\nthe evening: the cold, quiet 15 minute\nwalk to the club entrance from the\npier. Perhaps it\u2019d been to take the tube\nto Greenwich North. Compared with\nthe buzz of people and sound in central London, this was about as exciting\nas walking through a supermarket car\npark on a Sunday afternoon. (Which\nreminds me; there\u2019s not a single late\nnight food vendor! )\nMy verdict: besides Hot Chips\u2019\nstorming percussive set in the main\nroom, I did not really take to Matter.\nYes, it was clearly purpose-built, but it\nfelt too clinical and humourless. Matter is definitely not a place to go for\nthose who like nightclubs small and\nquirky. Like an out-of-town superstore,\nit produces the goods with a top quality line up, but it could do with more\ncharm.\nMatter\nHHHHK\n\u2018This is Not London\u2019 presents\nMoshi Moshi Records\u2019 10th\nBirthday Party.\nBest: Hot Chip\nWorst: Travel issues\nGo for...: The impressive headline acts.\nPrice: \u00a317.50\n\u201cThis is not London\u201d continues this weekend, with Justice on Saturday night.

Before I\nreveal that he was duly twatted in his\nnether-regions with a football, a brief\nintroduction to tour shall be given.\nEvery year, ICUAFC gallivant to an\noverseas country, normally in Eastern\nEurope to bring their unorthadox but\ncelebrated methods of socialising to the\nregion. In addition, the beautiful game\nthat is Matchbox is played, alongside\nthe optional football matches.\nLast summer, the destinations were\nPrague and Berlin. Tour secretary\nSkypesex, less often known as Chris\nParrott packed the 8 days away with a\nmultitude of activities, the first being a\nplane flight.\nThe year before, the less organised\ntour sec made us wing it to Bulgaria.\nUpon arrival at Prague and getting\nthe hostels sorted, IC dined at what\nhappened to be a \u201cPerfect Restaurant\u201d.\nThe more cultured among us went to\nMcDonald\u2019s.\nClub Mecca was the first club\nICUAFC graced with their presence.\nDisappoint they did not with electro,\nsunglasses in the dark, upper half nu-dity, vodka, stage climbing and \u201csharking\u201d all taking place. Club Mecca was\nalso the destination where it was discovered that some Americans which\nwere present in the union in the spring\nterm had followed us from said place\nto Prague. The claim that they hid in\nthe baggage area of the aeroplane are\nyet to be verified. For more details on\nthe early morning jaunts ask Vertical\nRat (Alex De Figueiredo).\nThe next morning (Sunday) had us\npractice the unlawful activity of drink\ndriving. Go karting was eventful with\nChromosone (Alex Childs) managing\nto break a kart, the track, his phone\nand knob within two laps of the cir-cuit. Fastest man on the day went\nto Michael Hughes, in which he celebrated by playing table football with\nthe track owner\u2019s daughter whilst the\nrest went back to the hostel - the 5th\nfloor of a historic building, with no lift,\na floor above a police station - to let the\nhangovers have their fun.\nIn preparation for the first of three\nfootball matches, Moonface (Mitchell\nFern) and others were rewarded for\ntheir carefree, blaz\u00e9 manner by being\naccosted by what I can only describe\nas a sex salesman. Amongst the standard patter of offering opportunities\nto solicit with barely legal fe/males,\nMoonface commended the salesman\u2019s\ninclusive nature. He politely declined\nattending and/or participating in an\nerotic burlesque featuring people of\nall creeds, heights, weights and sexual (gender) preferences. Jake Tucker\n(Christopher Killin) on the other hand\ncouldn\u2019t resist.\nRoger (Ed Lobb) naturally assumed\nthe role as the coach Imperial College\nTour Football Club, managing to give a\ngame to all thirty-something IC foot-ballers, in their first match against FC\nBankovni Balet. After a spirted display\nfrom 2.7% of the team, Green Card\n(Sam Rickards), IC lost 3-1.\nThe stadium in which the match was\nplayed holds over 100 000 people. The\nEnd.\nAfter the match, IC\u2019s local Prague\nguide and some of the home team players joined IC as they played Matchbox\nin a bar. The UEFA European Cup Final\nhappened to be on in the background.\nThe evening\u2019s events started at Batalion, a 24 hour pub. Prince Harry\n(Frank O\u2019Neill) was on majestic form\nwith his pint ingesting and sleeping at\nthe bar abilities.\nMonday morning brought the internal beach football competition, which\nS. Analdonkeyjuicelover (Sim Anandajeyarajah), Barack Obama (Yours Truly) and Prince Charles (Adrian Doyle)\nmissed due to the inability of the rest\nof the touring party to knock on their\nroom door when it was time to go.\nShite Garo (Michael Donovan) scored\nan overhead kick, which did just about\nnothing in his attempts to rein in his\nego inflation problem.\nThe beer crawl given by an unsuspecting but extremely helpful Czech\nlocal occupied the evening. After\nwalking for 45 minutes in search for\nthe first beer, which set us back 80\nshiny pennies and which happened to\nbe in another football stadium, Prince\nCharles decided to make up for missing the beach football by necking a\nglass of vodka with ananas (pineapple)\njuice between each watering hole.\nNearing the end of the night he\npassed out near a crossroad. There is\nwidespread debate about the cause\nof this sudden loss of consciousness.\nSome say the alcohol, some point to the\ndiscussion that took place between Dilbert (Scott Mckenzie), Steve Mclaren\n(Pete Hunt), Green Card and Burkin\u017eralok (Louis Burkinshaw) about who\nthe best player in the club was.\nRumours that Phalludopoulos\n(Michael Pursey) slept on the pavement floor outside the club - a 5 story\nbuilding catering for all needs: 1st\nfloor being a cloak room with cheesy\nmuic, 2nd floor housing a strip club,\n3rd floor being a dance club, 4th floor\na quiet room, full of books and board\ngames and the 5th floor being home to\na 60s and 70s disco room - IC ended up\nin after the crawl have been verified.\nFC Predni were the opponents for\nthe second match of tour. Roger, this\ntime fortified with a mostly sober team\nand a pen and paper, produced a tactician\u2019s masterclass at halftime when the\nscores were locked at nil a piece. Making an 11 man substitution, ICUAFC\nwent on to win 3 - 0.\nThe second event scheduled by Skypesex was a train ride from Prague to\nBerlin the next morning. Drew Peacock\n(Ricky Verra) armed with some music\nproduced perfect conditions for a rave.\nNaturally some ambassadors and their\ndaughters joined in the festivities, with\nthe club producing their best renditions of classic jumpen hits.\nShite Garo, Obama and Snout Jimmy\n(Adam Gill) had so much fun that they\ndecided to miss the Berlin train station\nand continue to Hamburg.\nBack at Berlin the first stop was the\nCircus hostel bar, home of the infamous boot challenge. Finish it in under\n90 seconds and keep the boot, under\nthree minutes and you receive the alcohol \u00e0 gratis. Prince Charles devised a\nplan to successfully complete the boot\nlater on that week.\nThe fascination or beaches didn\u2019t\nstop there as the touring party left Circus hostel bar to a nightclub with said\ntheme. Geldautomat (Daniel Wilson)\ndid his tour shirt proud by making\na large withdrawal. The next day IC\nfound a group of randomers to play a\nfootball match with. Tag-Along (Noah\nStevens), Brokeback (Simon Parker)\nand Mountain (Stewart Masters) decided to stage a mini tour Bola Bola\nbetween themselves. The first round\nwas completed as the final whistle of\nthe match went.\nThe next day, Roger, Barack, Moonface, Shite Garo, Snout Jimmy and\nBeadle (Jeremy Lovett) took part in a\nScrabble tournament. The end.\nRematch (Justin Winehouse) decided that Erol Alkan wasn\u2019t up to scratch\nat the nightclub and mitigated his displeasure by creating some oragami before passing out in the beer garden.\nThe final match arrived on the penultimate day of tour and it was a fiercely\ncontested match against the Berlin\nbranch of one of ICUAFC\u2019s sponsors,\nKPMG. It being Romain\u2019s - whose tour\nname is particularly offensive - birthday that day he thought it would be\ngood to score from fifty yards, minutes\nafter having a glass of gin. So he did.\nThe final night of tour was shared\nwith Romain\u2019s birthday, which meant\none thing, kebabs and alcohol. After\nthe Italian restaurant reneged on IC\u2019s\nbooking, they decided to have kebabs\nbefore witnessing Prince Charles\u2019 attempt to complete the boot. Romain\ngot lost on the 100 yard walk from the\nkebab shop to Circus hostel bar and\nthis delayed proceedings for an hour.\nShatters (James Skeen) decided to fly in\nfrom the UK to share our final night on\ntour and fail in trying to drink a boot.\nPrince Charles successfully finished\nthe boot which left IC in good spirits\nfor the tour awards ceremony.\nMan of tour went to Chromosone\nfor his antics which included losing all\nof his belongings at the train rave and\ndressing up as a phallus on the pub\ncrawl.\nPlayer of tour went to Roger for managing the 4 matches and producing a\n75% win rate.\nA special mention goes to Chris Parrott for organising what is thought of\nas one the best football tours in recent\nclub history. The time and planning\ndone was incredible and it showed, as\nthere wasn\u2019t a day where the club didn\u2019t\nhave anything to occupy themselves\nwith, thereby producing an excellent\nclub event which will be remembered\nfor many years to come.\nClockwise from bottom left: Footballers atop a Berlin monument; Coach Lobb and squad; Das Boot; The Tour mantra, revealed on the pub crawl\n\n"

Amidst the pomp and ceremo-ny, history was being made as roughly\nhalf of the graduands, for the first time\nsince Imperial broke away from University of London, received Imperial\nCollege London degrees.\nImperial Graduation ceremonies\nused to be low-key affairs but after\nWWII it was decided to make the\ndegree ceremony a major event. Officially known as Commemoration\nDay, it dates back to the visit of King\nGeorge VI and the Queen Mother in\n1945. The graduation ceremony was\norganised to coincide with the visit\nwhich commemorated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Royal\nCollege of Chemistry. The ceremony,\nwhich celebrated the oldest of Imperial\u2019s constituent institutions, became a\ncommemoration of Imperial students\nachievements, the first being held in\n1948; although it was not held in the\nRoyal Albert Hall back then.\nFromRoyalorigins,Commemoration\nday has become an important event in\nthe calendar and is an opportunity for\nthe Rector to advance his vision for\nthe coming year (and perhaps defend\nhis judgement from the previous. For\nSir Roy Anderson it was the first time\nhe has come face to face with a large\nnumber of Imperial students (albeit\ngraduating students) and a chance to\nintroduce himself to the student body\nat large.\nSimilar to the school assemblies\nwitnessed in many schools across the\ncountry, the ceremony started with the\nprocession of various members of the\ncollege, as well as the presidents of the\nfaculty unions and the main Imperial\nCollege Union [ICU]. Once everyone\nwas in their seats, ICU President Jenny\nMorgan, gave her welcome speech to\nall the graduates: a speech which was\nchanged this year so as to give a better\nrepresentation of the students at the\nCollege. Following on from her speech,\nit was the turn of the new Rector Sir\nRoy Anderson to give his first Comfelix Editor in Chief, and graduate of the College, Jovan Nedi\u0107 describes his experience of the day\nmemoration Day Speech.\nThere were two main themes to the\nRector\u2019s speech this year: the first was\nthe \u201cincreasing role of science, technol-ogy, medicine and business studies in\naddressing the major issues facing the\nworld today.\u201d The second was focused\non the \u201cissues facing higher education\nand research in the UK, and how Imperial is hoping to respond to the challenges ahead.\u201d\nTalking about the first point, Sir Anderson went on to say that \u201cmany believe \u2013 and I am among them \u2013 that\nthe most urgent and pressing need is\nfor intensive research worldwide to\ndevelop alternative sources of energy.\u201d\nWith most of today\u2019s funding focusing on defence, the Rector went on to\nsay that \u201cresearch that will make cheap\ncarbon capture a reality, or that will\nprovide carbon-free energy sources \u2013\nsuch as wind, waves and solar \u2013 is not\nadequately supported.\u201d In previous\nyears, universities were the main focal\npoint of pioneering research, and there\nis definitely a need to shift the focus\nback on them. Imperial already has a\nresearch programme into novel energy\nmethods, with the Rector saying that\n\u201cthis will expand greatly in the coming\nfew years.\u201d\nThe clear message seemed to be that\nuniversities, and in particular Imperial, will need to do more in the field\nof new energy sources, something that\nI am sure many students and even industries will find welcoming. However,\nthis then led onto the Rectors second\ntopic of the day, where he went on to\nsay that \u201cThe UK science budget more\nthan doubled between 1997 and 2000\nand in the same period research and\ndevelopment [R&D] expenditure increased by more than 20 per cent in\nreal terms.\nHowever, despite this, we still spend\nless in these areas than most of the major world economies.\u201d In essence, the\nRector was pointing out the fact that\nnot enough funding is given to these\nareas of research, and that potentially,\nthe government should do more to increase it if we are to ever get a feasible\nsolution to the energy problem.\nAside from the theme of research, Sir\nRoy Anderson went on to talk about the\nachievements of the College, in particular coming 6th in the world in the\nrecent Times Higher Education Survey\n[THES], as well as the employer satisfaction with Imperial graduates which\nis ranked equal with Harvard, Yale,\nCambridge and Oxford. The Rector\nalso commented on the high number\nof international students, 46% last year,\nremarking that this \u201cis enormously to\nour benefit.\u201d However this is a view\nthat many don\u2019t share since although\nmany view the high number of international students as an indication of\nthe world class reputation of Imperial\nCollege, others view it as detrimental\nto the UK students who wish to study\nat a world class institute. The high\ncalibre of Imperial students was also\nbrought up in the speech, as well as the\nincreasing pressure for providing accommodation for first years students,\nwith Sir Anderson commenting that\n\u201cWe cannot continue on this path. We\nhave therefore started to trial our own\nentrance examinations with the intent\nof introducing them in 2010.\u201d\nWith the speeches finished, it was finally time for the graduands to go on\nstage. Owing to the large number of\npeople graduating, everyone was told\nnot to applaud, except for the prize\nwinners. Contrary to popular belief,\ngraduands didn\u2019t receive any form of\ndocumentation, nor did they shake\nthe Rector\u2019s hand. Instead every new\ngraduate of the College went up to\nthe stage and shook the hand of Lord\nKerr of Kinlochard, the Chairman of\nthe Court and of the Council, followed\nby the Principal of their respective\nfaculty.\nAfter the long and mundane task of\nwatching everyone go up on stage, it\nwas then the turn of the new fellows,\nhonorary graduates and associates of\nthe college to get their awards. This was\nthenfollowedbythepresentationofthe\nnew pastoral care awards, who went to\nDr Bob Forsyth from the department\nof Physics, Karen MacDonald from\nthe Centre for Environmental Policy\nand finally to Dr Gabrielle Sinnadurai\nfrom the department of Computing.\nDr Gabrielle Sinnadurai unfortunately\npassed away before Commemoration\nDay, and in honour of her efforts and\nachievements through her time at the\nCollege, the awards will in future be\nnamed in her memory.\nThe ceremony ended with Lord Kerr\nof Kinlochard giving a few anecdotes\nto the slowly tiring students, as well\nas thanking all the parents and staff\nwho had been there for their students\nthroughout their time at College.\nWith the ceremony finally over, the\nnew graduates went their separate\nways for official photographs, which\ncould cost as much as \u00a355, followed\nby lunch with family and friends. The\nnight ended with many converging on\nthe Union for possibly the last time as\na year group. The day was long, the\nday was tiring, the day was expensive\n(costs ranged between \u00a330 and \u00a3175)\nbut it will certainly be one to remember for all the students involved.\nThe procession at the start of the ceremony, with the student officers and academic staff.\nLeft: Sir Roy Anderson giving his first Commemoration Day speech, whilst a student receives his congratulation from the Chairman on the right\nThe class of \u201808 talk thrills and spills\nWhile the rest of you enjoyed a day off, felix interviewed graduates about their time at this great institution\nSteph Alexopoulos\nBiology BSc\nWhat did you think of your course?\nMy undergrad went by really fast!

I think university is what you make of it- if you come here with no preconceptions and get involved you\u2019ll have a good\ntime. The sports and social clubs I\u2019ve been involved in helped me both socially and academically:\nDidn\u2019t you spend a lot of your time playing for ULU not Imperial though?\nWhile at Imperial, I played for ULU waterpolo, winning 3 BUSA gold medals and was team captain for a year.\nPlaying for a ULU team was a great way of meeting people from other colleges and finding out about different parts of London.\nDo you have any advice for freshers starting your course?\nIn your first term, do no work, just enjoy yourself!\nWhat are you doing now?\nI\u2019m now working full time for Rolls Royce on a graduate training program, I would definitely recommend doing a graduate program, you end up working with lots of people in the same boat.\nLooking back, would you do anything differently?\nI\u2019m pretty happy with my time at Imperial, possibly I drank a bit too much and should have concentrated\nmore in second year. Oh, and I\u2019d go to Camden more, and Shoreditch!\nDr Simon Leather, lecturer in applied ecology:\n\u201cI enjoy commemoration day, supporting all\nthe students I have worked with and finding out\nwhat they are doing now\u201d\nAlex Dorobantu\nAeronautical\nEngineering MEng\nAre you happy with your degree?\nI didn\u2019t enjoy it too much, I don\u2019t like that Aero has no real pastoral culture, this was especially pronounced as\nI came straight from a secondary school with a good pastoral atmosphere.

    "content": "Edward Townes\nGuest Writer\nAn Austrian perspective on things\nCan Carl Menger and his countrymen tell us anything about the current financial crisis?\nTo most people economics is a social\n\u201cscience\u201d, but it is actually filled with\nwrong opinions and faulty predictions.\nEconomists in practice take a variety\nof positions that can be divided into\n\u2018schools\u2019 of thought, where certain theories of generations of individuals have\ninspired a specific way of interpreting human action. One of the minor\nschools in particular differs in some\ntruly profound and fundamental ways\nfrom other mainstream ones, such as\nthe Keynesian or Chicago schools. It is\ncalled the Austrian School, and it has\nsome very interesting explanations for\ntoday\u2019s financial mess, which I will attempt to impart.\nThe Austrians were dominant in economic theory in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries and they were the first\nto explain the Great Depression and\nwhy centrally-planned economies are\nlogically impossible to succeed. Nevertheless, they were relegated to a minority position as a positivist revolution in\neconomics led by the man who said the\nGreat Depression could never happen,\nJohn Maynard Keynes, unfolded in the\n1930\u2019s. There were many reasons why\nthe Austrian School was pushed aside\nbut most importantly because Keynes\u2019\nstatistically-based theories validated,\nand therefore could be used to justify,\nthe government\u2019s attempts to intervene\nand manipulate the markets.\nSeveral leading Austrian scholars\npredicted today\u2019s economic problems,\njust as they also predicted the downturns in the Great Depression and the\n70\u2019s, and they explain that the root\ncause is the same each time. Mainstream economists generally blame\nthe business cycle on some variant of\nerrant human nature, such as greed\nor confidence. I personally found the\nmainstream explanation entirely want-ing, for why should such an abundant\nhuman characteristic as greed suddenly become systematically destructive in a specific time and place? Or,\nif consumer confidence was the only\nproblem, then surely we could propa-gandise our way to prosperity? The\nissue with the Austrian explanation is\nthat it is politically unpalatable, and as\na result you will rarely hear this point\nof view. Here goes:\nFirst, a quick lesson on money and\nmonetary policy. Let's say I give you\n\u00a3100 and let you decide what you want\nto do with it. The ratio of the money\nyou save for future consumption to the\nmoney you spend right away is referred\ntoasyour\u201ctimepreference\u201d.Peoplewith\nhigh time preferences want to spend\ntheir available money quickly, whereas people with low time preferences\ngenerally save their money, and thus\nexpand the supply of money available\nto be borrowed at the bank. Your time\npreference depends on a large number\nof things, such as your anticipation of\nchildren, personality, wealth level, etc.\nThe aggregate time preference of everyone in the economy gives us the savings rate in that economy. People who\nwant to borrow money for investment,\nor otherwise, comprise the demand\nfor credit, and together the supply and\ndemand for money meet to form a\nmarket price on money through time,\nwhich is the interest rate. The interest\nrate tells entrepreneurs the minimum\nreturn on investment or \u201cprofit\u201d that\nthey need to achieve to justify making the investment. Thus, the balance\nbetween the supply (savers) of money\nand the demand (borrowers) for money is absolutely central in determining\neconomy-wide economic behaviour.\nEnter fractional-reserve or no-re-serve banking supported by a central\nbank, with its ability to produce money\nout of thin air. In today\u2019s world nearly\nall central banks practice \u201cno-reserve\u201d\nbanking in that they do not relate the\nquantity of money they issue to any\nfixed ratio of hard commodities (nor-mally gold) that they hold to back the\npaper currency. You see, in a free market banking system, currencies would\ninevitably be backed by hard commodities otherwise those currencies would\nbe vulnerable to runs. However, under\nfractional or no reserve central bank-ing, there are laws created to enforce\nthis fiat monetary system, such as legal\ntender laws and \u201clenders of last resort\u201d\n(central banks) laws. By contrast, in a\nfree market banking economy, if someone wants to expand the amount of\nmoney (by mining gold for example),\nthey have to take resources out of the\neconomy and apply them more profit-Carl Menger, founder of the\nAustrian school.\nPrinting money may be easy but it is certainly not the solution to this crisis\nably than the interest rate. Thus there\nis always a balance and restriction on\nthe creation of money.\nHowever, in our current monetary\nsystem, which is not backed by any\nhard commodity, the central bank can\nliterally create money out of nothing,\nand then put it into the banking system\nso that this new money masquerades as\nsavings. In doing this, the central bank\ninflates the supply of money, and thus\nmanipulates the price of money (the\ninterest rate), whilst debasing people\u2019s\nsavings and depreciating the purchasing power of the currency. This is why\ncentral banks claim to set the interest rate in the economy; in fact what\nthey are doing is controlling the creation and destruction of money, which\nin turn influences the price of money.\nThe consequence of a central bank artificially fixing the price of money is\nthat the balance between investors and\nsavers is thrown off. Prices are simply\nmarket information for people managing resources, so when the prices\nare artificial, entrepreneurs\u2019 actions\nare systematically misguided, because\nthey've been given misinformation.\nSo when a central bank manipulates\nthe money supply with fiat (paper) currencies under fractional or no-reserve\nbanking, it has the devastating effect of\ndistorting the balance between savings\nand investing, creating mal-investment\nin the economy which at first appears\nto be a boom because people are expanding production chains with the\ncheap credit to meet the expected new\ndemand for goods. Except that the\nexpansion becomes more and more\nunstable and must come to an end because the actual balance between saving and consumption is not what the\ninterest rate suggests it is, and a painful recession, or price correction must\nthen take place to liquidate the mal-investments.\nBut there is more to it. The central\nbank can keep the charade going for\na while by creating consumption demand though artificially cheap credit\nwhich allows people to borrow money\nat a artificially low interest rate, to\nspend on cars and other such things.\nUnfortunately this kind of economy is\ninherently unstable because it is driven\nby debt instead of savings. All it takes\nis one contraction in the money supply (a \"credit crunch\", if you will), for\nthe entire thing to fall in on itself as no\nnew money is made available to service\ndebts. This economic boom and bust\nis a natural consequence of our monetary system and today's financial crisis\nshould thus be absolutely no surprise.\nThis is a brief explanation of what\nthe Austrian School has to say about\nthe business cycle. Each time that the\ncentral banks provide artificially cheap\ncredit, as facilitated by fractional or\nno-reserve banking and fiat curren-cies, the bubbles manifest in various\ndifferent areas of the economy. Today,\nthe immediate bubble to burst was\nthe real-estate one. The reasons for\nthis bubble existing the first place is\nmost importantly the cheap credit, but\nsecondary blame goes to many well-intentioned, but classically misguided,\nUS government efforts in the 90\u2019s and\nearlier this decade to get banks to loan\nto individuals who were not qualified\nfor the loans, i.e. \u201csub-prime\u201d. This\nwas compounded by laws such as:\nthe Community Reinvestment Act of\n1977; the quartering of Fannie\u2019s and\nFreddie\u2019s reserve requirements which\nwere quasi-government entities with\nall the moral hazards that ensue; land-use regulations; the dissolution of a law\n(the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933) that\ndivorced investment and commercial\nbanking, and various others that created a flawed framework within which\nnormal profit seeking behaviour became systematically destructive.\nOur problem now is that most peo-ple, including most economists, misdiagnose the causes of today\u2019s financial\ncrisis. Therefore, instead of allowing\nunsound investments to liquidate,\nthe governments of the world are intent on making more money out of\nthin air in order to price fix the value\nof loans which in reality are virtually\nworthless.\nI believe that we are faced with two\npossible solutions, which can be blend-ed, to the problems of the mal-invest-ments that were created by the artificially cheap credit. On the one hand\nwe can allow prices to correct themselves quickly without government\nintervention, in the process creating a\nlarge amount of losses for the people\ndirectly involved in the mortgage derivative market and other markets that\nwere similarly, but to a lesser extreme,\naffected by central banking. On the\nother, we can fight the ultimately inevitable and necessary price corrections\nby using government gifts of large\namounts of cash created out of more\ndebt, further boosting inflation and the\ndebt burden which may well be enough\nto send our already weak economy into\na prolonged depression.\nThe raging bull of Merrill Lynch, bull down!\nACCA Accenture Allen & Overy LLP Amadeus Argus\nInformation&AdvisoryServicesLtd ArthurD.Little ARUP\nBAE Systems Bank of America BlackRock Bristows\nCadbury Plc Cambridge Consultants CarrillionPlc CHP\nConsulting CIPFA Citadel Investment Group Colin\nBuchanan Corefiling Corus CRA International Credit\nSuisse CSC Cummins Data Connection Deloitte\nDetica Deutsche Bank DNV Ltd Doosan Babcock\nEnergyLtd DowChemicalCompany DRWTradingGroup\nE.on EDF eFinancialcareers.com Ernst & Young\nFactset Fidelity International Gallop GCHQ GE\nGlobal Research Gifford Goldman Sachs H.M.
