    "content": "FELIX\nCARNIVAL QUEEN\nPROFILES PROLIFIC\nKRYSTINA.\nIt should be obvious, even to those who\nhave not had the pleasure of meeting\nMiss Krystina Bragiel, that no one but\nno one could optimistically oppose her\nelection as the Carnival Queen. It will\nafter all be merely a formality to appoint\nher. However, for democracy's sake\nKrystina will stand for election together\nwith other nominees.\nTo expound on her many varied talents\nis hardly necessary here; her fame has\nalready spread the length and breadth\nof I.C. However for the ill informed few\namongst you here are a few pointers as\nto her desirability (as Carnival Queen).\nTwo of Krystina's diverse activities un-doubt ably recommend her election. Last\nterm K ry st in a was elected to that much\ncoveted position that of Queen of the\nsecond floor annex (Beit Hall). You will\nagree of course that this is a position\ndemanding infinite charm, an outstanding personality and resolute de term in at ion. Krystina fu1 filled the position ad-mira bly, indeed she has created a precedent that her successors will find difficult\nto emulate. Added to this Krystina successfully captained I. C.W. A. against the\nI.C. Soccer Club at hockey. Her cross\nfield glances were superb. Unfortunately\nher entrancing poise completely mes meri sed the Umpire who was sent off for\nnot attending to his duties.\nPlifllliBSi*:,.\n....... \u2022 :/\u2022::\nCAROLINE.\nSweet Caroline! lov i est woman of that\nname;\nYour smile and plenty cheer the working...\nSweet Caroline, sitting by a brook\nWith brave young Porritt, lovely, fresh,\ngreen.\nBid court the lad with many a love lv look.\nSuch looks as none could look but a Carnvial Queen.\nShe told him stories to delight his ear;\nShe showed him favours to allure his eye;\nBut whether unripe years did want\nconceit,\nOr he refused to take her figured proffer,\nThe tender nub b ler would not take the\nbait,\nBut smile and jest at every gentle offer.\nAlone, he thought of how he'd been too\ngreen,\nAnd set his mind to make her Carnival\nQueen.\nAnd this explains why Porrittheads this\nnomination\nAnd others wrote the explanation!\n(Wjith a pol jogi tes to those gentlemen\nwho wrote the lines that scan.)\nThe above should be sufficient to convince you that Krystina,* and Krystina\nalone is the perfect choice for the I.C. Carnival Queen.\nProposed by A. Miller.\nMISS JOYCE FOWLER.\nProptosed for the Carnival Queen by\nN.B. Greaves and D.K. Fisk on behalf\nof the City & Guilds Union.\nSo far in this competition, proposer s have made elaborate efforts, often to the\nembarrassment of their candidates, to\ncover up deficiencies in carriage.and character with stunts and gimmicks, and just\nplain blurb.\nBeing convinced of the immorality of\nmodern advert i zing techniques and having\nconfidence in the powers of discrimination\n' of students, the C.& G.U. wishes to\npresent truths, not half-truths, in support of its candidate, Mis Joyce Fowler.\nSlight and graceful, smart and pr act ical, sweet and beautiful, Joyce has preserved feminine charm through the\nrig ours of a Guilds education. One of\nJoyce's most appealing qualities is that\nshe is quiet without being shy, a rare\nquality in attractive women. She hasn't the figure of a Sophia Loren, the forceful\ncharacter of Bessie Braddock, or perhaps\nthe athletic physique of a Mary Bignal.\nIf you want this type of Carnival Queen,\nyou had better invite their nominations,\nbut Joyce will do for us.\nN.B. Greaves\nD.K. Fisk\n!\u2014REFECTORIES\nUNDER FIRE Dear Sir,\nIn view of the fact that the prices uf\nmeals served in the Imperial College Refectories are due to be increased b van v thing from sixpence to one and sixpence\nto make a few comments on the quality\nof the food that is continously churned\nout in large quantities for the consumption of a mass of students whose complaints\nand suggestion are always ignored by those\nresponsible for the catering arrangements.\nI am appalled to the total indifference\ndisplayed by Mr. Mooney and his staff\nseveral restaurants giving better service\nmuch better food at lower prices than this\nso-called non profit making organisation.\nIt is therefore reasonable to assume that\nthe present conditions in I. C.R. are due\nto the fact that Mr. Mooney imagine that\nhe has an absolute monopoly whereas if\nstudents would look around they would\nsoon realise how they are being treated.\nI therefore advocate a boycott of Imperial College Refectories until such a time\nas Mr. Mooney is capable (a) of providing\na reasonable service, and (b) of meals\nwhich are both eatable and edible.\nYours faithfully,\nP.J. Cunningham\nDear Sir,\nI, and many others, regard the increased\nrefectory charges with disgust. It is normally a \"point of honour\" among students\nto decry their refectory meals, and although\nnot belonging to the extremists, Jhe continual serving up of lukewarm foods has\nmade me feel that it is about time something was done visibly to attempt to justify the increase.\nHaving visited a large number of University refectories, I would like to know\nwhy vegetables cannot be served up separately from a hot plate, as is done elsewhere thus ensuring hot meals as well\nas allowing a choice of vegetables instead\nof having an unwanted combination thrust\nat one.\nYours faithfully,\nColin McArdle\nTHE MAY BALL, 1961\nNow only two years after its formation\nthe I.C. May Ball is firmly fixed in the\nCollege Social Calendar. On Friday May\n2nd1959, the most fabulous event was\nattended by over 600 people. This was the\nfi irs it May Ball. The second was even\nmore successful.\nThis year the Entertainments Comittee are combining with the Charity Carnival Committee to promote a May Ball\non Friday May 5th( NOT Friday May\n19th as previously publicised). However,\nthe ball will retain the flavour of the previous May Balls, being a formal event.\nThe whole of the Union Building will\nbe opened for dancing to th j ree bands\nfrom 9.30 p.m. until dawn, a cabaret.\ndrinking in three bars and lavish buffet.\nYou may of course purchase the winning ticket number. If you do, you will\nbe chauffeur driven to and from the Ball\nand entertained throughout the evening\nat the Union's expense. The price of the\nticket will be refunded.\nYou would be well advised to order your\nticket now and ensure your share in the\nfun. Double tickets are a modest \u00a32.2.0.\neach. Last year there was a heavy demand\nfor tickets and an even heavier one is\nexpected this year. So to avoid disappoint-ment, please complete and return the\napplication from the Union Office, with\nyour remittance now.\nYEOMAN of TM GUARD\nby J. McManus\nOPERA AND BALLET\nby I.L. Gibson\nPostgraduates and others in London dur-ring the Easter Vacation will have the op-put unity of seeing the first performance\nof revised production of \"Giselle\" which\nwill be given at Covent Garden on April\n4th. The ballet has been extended with\nsome additional choreography by Frederick\nAshton and now occupies a whole evening.\n\"Giselle\", one of the oldest ballets ;\nn the repertory, tells the story of a village\nmaiden who, after falling in love with a prince and then realizing he can never\nbe her's, becomes dist acted and dies, on iy to join the 'Willies' \u2014 a group of young\ngirls who died on their wedding nights and\nwho now haunt the woods, unable to rest\nin their tombs. Balletomanes will have the\nopportunity of comparing the versions t f Fpnteyn, Beriosova, Nerina, and Page\nwho will alternate in the title role.\nDuring the five weeks Opera Company\nin on tour, four other full-length ballets\nwill be. given. There are \u2014 Ondme, La Fille\nMai Gardee. Le Lac des Cygnes and the\nSleeping Beauty.\nIt has been brought to my notice that\nit is not widely known in the College that\nit is always possible to get into popular\nperformances at Covent Garden (first\nnights etc.) if one is prepared to stand.\nIf all the other seats are sold beforehand\n(As is the case with the present series of\nperformances of \"Fidelio\"), forty-two\nstandings tickets are sold at 4 p.m. on\nthe afternoon of the performance, permitting the hp lder to stand at the back\nof the Stalls Circle.\nDuring March and -April, Sadler's Wells are staging light operettas many,\nwho perhaps find Wagner and Verdi rather\nheavy going,will enjoy. These are \"Die\nFledermaus\" by J. Strauss and \"Merrte\nEngland\" by Edward Germans the latter\nre-entering the repertory on April 11th. The evening of March 24th saw the\nconclusion of the fourth successful production of a Gilbert and Sullivan musical by the I.C. Musical Society. In this,\nonce again, the ranks of I.C. were strengthened by some members of R.C.M., but\na most welcome sign was the presence\nof a representative from I. C.W. A. in the\nchorus.\nThroughout the First Act an all pervading lethargy tended to mar the singing movement, but the interval the performers raised the standard to a high level\nfor an amateur company.\nAccompaniment of an interesting nature\nwas provided by the I.C. orchestra which,\nonce it had progressed beyond the rather\nshaky overture, did nothing to disgrace\nMself, and indeed its m tel jing emt anticipation of the singers (and dare one add.\nthe conductor), kept the whole together.\nOf the principal soloists both Lorna\nHeywood and Christina Clarke not only\nsang well, but also acted, a welcome feature on any British stage. Perhaps the most\noutstanding performances were by Richard\nHa^ell, who, as Shadbolt, had even this\nhard-to-please audience actually laughing,\nand by JNiei Murray, who successfully\nnegotiated the tricky to un gue twisters and\ncapers of Jack Paint.\nThe men's chorus left much to be des-ire, but the women's chorus was adequate.\nPerhaps the greatest problem in this respect was the distribution of the chorus\nso that its members could all see the\nconductor, and the frequent positioning\nof the men's chorus in such a clearly obscuring line did nothing to help either\nthe overall unity of attack, nor the bal-ance, where, one suspected, the orchestral\nbrass section was used as a partial\ncounterweight, which in effect drowned\nthe sopranos.\nThe set, designed by Maurice MosSf\nwas effective and clearly aimed at providing the maximum of space on the small\nand often overcrowded stage.\nThe appearance of an unscheduled duck\non the scene caused little dismay to the\nsingers, and passed un remarked by the\nstony audience. This I.C. audience could\nwell come in for some criticism in its art ic attitude which gave the hard-working performers no help or encouragement what-so ever. "

The 1st XI plays the other\nbig colleges first and several of the club\nsides in and around London whilst the\nlesser colleges are dealt with by the 2nd and 3rd teams. The climax of the season\nis the annual Devon Tour which starts\non the first Tuesday after the end of\nterm and last's for ten days with 8 or 9\nmatches in that time. The tour is centred\non Plymouth and Torquay and matches\nare played against a variety of clubs in\nthese areas. Of course it's not all cricket\nand there really is some sport to be had\non a tour such as this. I urge anyone who\nwants to relax (if playing ten dav s cricket\n'on the trot' is relaxing) and play some\ngood cricket to consider applying to go\non the tour. The cost to you depends entirely on what you eat and drink but\nwon't come to more than \u00a315 unless you\nhave an insatiable thirst.\nOf more immediate interest, perhaps\nare the arrangements for net trials at the\nbeginning of the season. These, will be\non Monday 24th April at 1 p.m. and\nLeague fixtures for the current season\nare now completed and four of our six\nteams have gained promotion. The first\nteam will be back in division I next\nseason, but, perhaps, our outstanding success was in the third division, where our\n3rd,4 th, and 6th teams won divisions\nIIIA, and IIIC respectively. The 5th team would no doubt have won their\nleague too but for the fact that the I.C.4 th team were in the same division, -and\nthus they had to be content with second\nplace.\nThe U.L. Championships were held on\n19th and 20th February and our congr at rul at ions go to C.L. Chow who only lost\nlost 21-19 to G.

If they\never start thinking in terms of twos this\nisland will really be overcrowded.\nCrowded... specially the tube system. If\na person ever finds himself trapped in\na mass of people all heading the direction\nopposite to that he wants to go (this\nhappens to every station at 5 p.m.); the\nonly chance to stay put is to grab anything and hold on for dear life (preferably\na sexy blonde). Even though you might\nstill end up on the platform when you\nreally want to be on the train, at least\nyou have someone to talk to while you\nwait for next train. Undoubtedly you will\nbe pushed back onto the next train\nwhether it is the right one or not so to\nmake the whole thing worthwhile you\nhave to make sure that the sexy blonde\nends up on the same train. It never fails,\nI have met more blondes that way.\n. I had intended to w j rite this article\nneW the beginning of October, however,\nmy first assignment took all my time. This\nassignment was to locate all of the better\npubs in London (and some of the worst).\nThis project is not anywhere complete,\nbut I hope that within the next two years\nI will be able to produce a guide to the\npubs in South Kensington.\nTo add to the enjoyment of living on\na budget provided by the Board of Trade\nI have bought a car. Not much of one\non anybody's standard, but it goes like\na charm (occasionally like a car), sits\nfour people, does thirty miles to the gallon of petrol (gas), and about twice that\nfar on oil. It has such equipment as\ndoors, floor-boards, windows, and other\nWednesday 26th April at 2 p.m. at Harlington.

Capt.) or\nAlan Bushby (Sec.), both in the New\nHostel.\nThe Club hop will be on March 18th and we need a dozen people to help\norganize this; volunteers may contact Ian\nTowner (Treas.) in the Old Hostel. The\nAnnual Dinner will be early next term,\nthe provisional date being Monday 8th May.\nG. Brough\nSHOOTING\nby A.S. R. Cousins\nSince the last report the Club shot\nagainst Birmingham and managed to win\nwith a good score of 682 against 664. The\nhighlight of this term, however, is the\nConstituent College competition for the\nCourtman Shield. Guilds, the holders,\nwon the first round with a score of 584;\nR.C.S. obtained 579 and R.S. M.576. The\nsecond round contained a surprise; R.C.S. won with 582 and R.S. M. trailed slightly\nwith 5,71- The third and fir al round will\nhe shot on Wednesday -1st March.\nA newcomer to rifle shooting this term\nis Bedford College who are trying to form\na club. In the meantime we are assisting\nin this project by providing range and\ncoaching facilities. It is hoped that by next\nseason the standard will be such as to enter\na team in the Inter Collegiate League.\nsuch comforts. Also it readily starts after\nhalf an hour of crackling on a warm day.\nThe only thing I have to be careful of\nis that if ever it backfires it will blow\nitself off the road.\nMy project at the college is coming along\nlike a bat out of hell, but apparently\nthey won't give me a degree for producing bats, so I have tried something else\nwhich might interest them al it le more.\nHowever, I am still learning how to spell\nthe names of the units used in my project\nso there will probably be a slight delay,\nlike a couple of years.\nWe haven't had any of the bad fogs\nin London that you hear about, at least\nI don't think so, the mist outside right\nnow is so heavy that I cannot see what\nthe weather is like. The weather is\nreally something over here, the sun has\nthree forms: mist, drizzle, and pouring;\nhowever, the rain has only two forms:\nbuckets and holy \u00a3&@ %' where did\nall this water come from in the last five\nminutes?\nSport is another big thing at the col-leg e, if you're not a player then you play\nthe pools. Everybody plays the pools, nobody wins, but it is the prime enjoyment of everybody to see the other guy\njust about die when he learns that he\nhad seven out of eight draws correct.\nWell, the mist is starting to come\nthrough my window and it is getting\nharder to see the page so that I had\nbetter close before I cannot see the type-writer. Actually that is one reason, the\nother is that the bar in the Union closes\nin fifteen minutes and I must go over\nfor my night cap.\nThe Club is being well represented by\nits first eleven who have won all their ten\ngames since Christmas. Tomorrow, March\n4th, the final of the U.L. Cup will take\nplace at Motspur Park (K.O.3p. m.), and\nI.C. will be trying to equal Kings record\nof three victories in successive seasons.\nI.C.s opponents, as in the final two years\nago, are Kings; I.C. won this game 3-0\nShould I.C. win the Cup they will have\na splendid chance of pulling off the\ndouble, a feat only performed once be-fore: by U.C. in 1952. at the time of\nwriting I.C. have two league games to\nplay, one against Kings and the one\nagainst L.S.E. The second eleven have also been playing reasonably well recently, and are at\npresent second in their league. Like the\nfirst eleven they have reached the final\nof their cup competition. Their opponents\nwill be L.S.E. second eleven, who they\nhave already beaten twice this season in\nleague matches.\nThe third eleven, playing in the same\nleague as most College's second elevens,\nwill have to fight hard to avoid relegation\nbut the fourth eleven, who have already\nbeen playing consistently well since the\nstart of the season, are well placed for\npromotion.\nOn 16th March the Club will be holding its Annual Dinner. The guest of honour will be Douglas Insole, the well-known\nc rike ter and amateur footballer. Tickets\ncan be obtain ad from Club officials.\nFinally, I hope to see a large number\nof the College at Motspur Park on Saturday for the finals. Coaches will be running from the Union, and particulars will\nhe posted on College notice boards.\nTHE BLACKBURN TWO-STEP.\nNo, this is not a Lancastrian Clog\nDance. It is in fact the I. C.W.

In the\ncontest against Goldsmith's newcomer to\nthe team, Cohen, won a convincing victory\nwith reaping throw followed up with a scarf hold. This was followed up with\nquick wins by Home and Simons who despatched their opponents in good time.\nDowning then fought a draw with a rather\nhefty orange belt who seemed quite content to hang on for a drawn contest.\nThe two Universities men, Bowles and\nRamsbottom, both won their fights\nagainst an orange belt and a green belt of\nsome years experience respectively.

UNLUCKY IN RELAY\nSaturday 25th Feb. saw what must be the\nhighlight of the season for I.C. \u2014 the Hyde\nPark Road Relay. This year we had a record entry of 75 teams to run over the\nnew three mile course round the Serpentine in Hyde Park. In spite of a bad\nstart the weather brightened up and the\nrace was started in a blaze of sunlight by\nJack Crump. St. Edmunds Hall, Oxford\nled for the first two laps but were overhauled soon in the third lap as Manchester, Leeds and Loughborough moved\nthrough. Ted Wilkins set the I.C. Team\noff to their best start for years, leading\nat the half way mark, and handing over\nin 4th place. Dave Hammonds running\nwell against the stiff opposition did well\nto hang on to the leading group and\nhanded over 8th. Pete Warren on the third\nlap brought us steadily up through the\nfield again to 5th place and handed over\nto John Collins in an excellent position\nfor catching the leaders. This he proceeded\nto do w th masterful determination, taking the lead at the half way point' with\nManchester dropping back to 5th. John\nCleator, on the fifth stage set out a ben\nsecond lead and proceeded to increase\nthis to 30 seconds, doing the third fastest\ntime of the day and running a very well\njudged race. Loughborough we i^e hanging on to second place and Birmingham\nthird, while Manchester had moved up\nto fourth and Queen's College Camb. to\nfifth place. The tension mounted as George\nWenk, our last man set out with a thirty\nsecond lead and we watched first Hill\nof Manchester, and Turner of Queen's, following in hot pursuit; Turner being\nthe National University C.C.

Turner finished with\nthe fastest time of the day in second\nplace winning the Minor Colleges Trophy\nfor\" Queen's. George Wenk hung on gallantly to give I.C. third place just beating Birmingham by one second.

I was in a lousy mood and if it hadn't been\nfor an extremely interesting blonde drama\nstudent I would soon have departed. As\nit was, the party went to the Six Bells,\nand thence, for coffee, to the drama\nstudent's flat. While the coffee wa B being\nmade, one of the other students came to\nme with a belt in her hand.\n\"I would like to inform you that you've\nbeen kidnapped\", she said to me. This\nwas the last straw.\n\"Oh, really?\" I said. \"Well I feel no\ndifferent to what I did a few minutes ago.\nI'm still sitting here.\"\nHer reply to this was to make a lunge\nat my spectacles with a cry: \"You HAVE\nbeen kidnapped; we've leaving here now.\"\nI grabbed my spectacles, and said:\n\"Stop being s tai pid and sit down! I came\nhere for coffee AMD COFFEE I'M GOING\nTO HAVE!\"\nThey all went into long Secret Servicetype whispers. I interrupted them by saying I wished to go to the lavatory. This\ncaused consternation! Finally they extracted from me a promise that I would\ncome back, and they backed this up by\nposting people at the doors, on the stairs,\nand at the windows. How stupid can one\nget?\nEventually they agreed that since I seemed to be in a bad mood they would\nonly take me as far as U.L. U, where\nthey would photograph me.\nIt appeared that the whole idea was\na publicity stunt for a play they are do-ing, called '\"The Prisoner\". However, the\nwhole idea seemed absolutely stupid, the\nadolescent action of a conglomeration of\nexistentialist idiots, the neolithic ravings\nof obfuscated partisans.\nWell, at any rate, the Imperial College\nMascot is once again back in residence.\nr YOUTH WORK\nI There is an urgent need for helpers and\nin s tru o tors in the London Boy's Clubs.\nMuch valuable work is being done there\nat the present time so why not offer your\nservices now for one night a week or at\nthe week-end to this worthy cause.

The motion\nwas \"That modern advertising is im or al.\"Both Guilds and R.C.S. put up a high\nstandard but the Guilds team won by a quite large majority; their victory was\nundoubtedly due to. their teamwork and\nthe excellent take-off of modern advertising by Jim Carter.\nThe last round took place on 23rd February. The motion was \"That television\nis the idiot's lantern.\" Guilds, proposing\nthis, took a humorous view typified by\nNorman Greaves who said that if a man\ncarried a television set about his house\nas a lantern then that would indeed be\nan idiot. Mines opposing were more serious and John Loome in a first-rate sum-ming-up ripped to pieces the frail hypothesis of illogical argument set by the\nGuilds team. Thus Mines won the debate.\nNevertheless the total gave Guilds the\noverall win and they will be awarded the\nImperial College Union Debating Challenge Cup. The jug des, led by Jack McCouby, said that 0ui lds had shown a consist ant ly high level of debating though\nMines had put up a good fight in the last\ndebate.\nThe Competition seems to have aroused\na new interest in debating and all the colleges seem anxious to have another go\nnext year.\nIMPERIAL CLOSE SECOND IN\nUNIVERSITY PLAY FESTIVAL\nOn Thursday, February 23rd Imperial\nCollege Dramatic Society performed \"The\nBlack Stirk's Light\" at Battersea College. The play presents a powerful study\nof a husband's jealousy of the sometime\nschool-friend of his younger wife in the\nconfinement and isolation of an ocean\nlighthouse. The situation is developed as\nsuspicion of Billy's relationship with his\nwife grows upon Angus, an embittered\nformer sea-captain, despite all the efforts\nof the third 'keeper, Nat, to prevent\ntrouble on the eve of his retirement.\nIn his adjudication, Mr. William Kendall commended the coherence of Peter\nBowden's production and was impressed\nay the most impressive set, created by\nJohn Darling and lighted by Collin Winrow.- Apart from too much noise from\nJohn Horrocks, too little from John Gordon and insufficient bounce from Brian\nConnelly, the actors were also commended\nfor their performance.\nThe Festival showed an interesting selection of plays to very poor audiences,\ndue, one hopes, rather to its being held\nso far from U.L. U. than to complete lack\nof interest. Mr. Kendall, pointing this out\nin his final summing up on Friday, noted\nalso that the standard of production was\nfairly uniform, there being nothing really\nbad and nothing really outstanding, except\npossibly the excellent, but non-competitive\nproduction of Pinter's \"The Dumb\nWaiter\" by Q.M. C. He went on to commend particular points arising from some\nof the plays, mentioning \"The Black\nStirk's Light\" on the basis of the set,\nPeter Bowden's production and the acting\nof John Hjorrocks and Brian Connelly,\nand said that he found it very difficult to\ndecide between the best three productions\nof the\"*Festival. With only few marks between them, he played King's \"The Room\"\nby Harold Pinter 3rd, Imperial College\n2nd, and awarded the Clee Cup to Goldsmith's( for at least the second year run-ning) , for an original play by one of their\ncast, \"The Noisy Whimper\".\nIt is hoped to present ''The Black\nStirk's Light\" to the College during Carnival Week and nearer at hand, the Dramatic Society's Easter production \"The\nAscent of F6.\" by W.H.

    "content": "FELIX 3\nEditorial comment[ JUttetd ta the Edltm Dear Sh\nMuch attention has been focussed recently on a controversial series of articles\npublished in the Oxford'magazine 'Isis'\nand a letter on the same subject was\nprinted in the last edition of 'Felix'. The\narticles in question were reviews by students of the academic lectures given at\nthe University and caused much argument amongst the Dons. Eventually publication of the articles was banned by the\nproctors.\nOpinions on this action differed widely.\nIn many quarters the proctors were\ncondemned for their \"high handed\" action while elsewhere the 'Isis' staff were\naccused of an ir res posible action.\nAt Imperial College a much more conservative atmosphere prevails: pos sibi ly the so called \"apathy\" of which we hear\nso much .However, we must all be aware\nthat a similar state of affairs exists here *\nmany is the time that we hear \"old so\nand so's\" lectures bitterly criticised over\nthe refectory tables. If we treat this as\na serious problem then we can set about\nsolving it in two ways. Firstly we can\nfollow the Oxford example and start\nthrowing bombs.) Apart from creating a disturbance and probably much hard feeling this kind of approach could achieve\nlittle else. It is destructive.\nOn the other hand we can adopt a constructive approach. Much could be gained\nby serious discussion among those who\nare interested. Could it be the proposed\n\"Educational Society might be a step in\nthis direction?\nARE YOU HONEST?\nWe note with curiosity the fact that\nwhereas the circulation of 'Felix' is remaining fairly steady, as judged by the\nnumber of copies left over each fortnight.\nth\u00ab cash return is steadily dropping. On\nthe last issue there was a discrepancy\nof between \u00a33 and \u00a34. You may not think\nthat your 'Felix' is worth four pence but\nif you take one away then for heaven's sake pay for it. After ail we are amongst\nthat 5 per cent of the British population\nwith the highest I.Q. rating so we should\nbe res on ably honest. Are you?\nCOPY DAY for the next issue, the last\nof this term, is Wednesday 8th March\nfor all letters, feature articles etc. and\nSunday 12th March for sport and other\narticles of a topical nature. Out on Friday\n17th March, one week before the end of\nterm.\nDear Sir,\nI hope that if Felix is to continue what\nI imagine purports to be independant reporting of the R.C.S. Union Meetings,\nit will at least send along a reporter for\nI cannot believe that the writer of 'Serious\nSide' was actually at the Meeting.\nAccording to your report, the meeting\nwas spent considering the Constitution,\nwhilst what actually happened was that\nthe matter of the Constitution was raised\nunder A. O.B. Mr. McPherson indicated\none or two obvious anomalies and ana-chron isms, and asked if it could be re vied. I said I would not accept any discussion\ninvolving proposed changes in the Constitution for the obvious reason that such\na review is not a matter to be discussed\nlightly at the end of a some-what sport-type Meeting. I did say, however, that\nI would be pleased to accept any motion\nleading to discussion of the Constitution\nat the next Union Meeting. I also said\nthat if we are to have this discussion,\nthen it was obviously essential that the\nUnion should be fully aware of what\nwas to be discussed; and to facilitate this\nthe Constitution would be made more'\nreadily a val able to every member of the\nUnion (Year Reps, now have large nos.).\nI also said that the Union General Committee \u2014 (not the Executive, no such\nbody exists) would examine the Constitution to find a basis for discussion.\nThe procedure adopted is that the Geneneral Committee has considered the Constitution and Year Reps, are now end-ea vau ring to discuss it in their depart-ment s. At a further Meeting-of the General Committee it is hoped that a fairly\ncomprehensive idea of any revision considered necessary will be obtained. This\nwill then be put before the next Union\nMeeting.\nI trust that this has cleared up the misconception of your reporter and anyone\nelse not at the last R.C.S. Union Meeting.\nDear Sir,\nAfter Mr. W.A. Irvine's entirely unprovoked attack on the College newspaper\nFELIX, published in the Hallowed\nPages of the One Hundred and Fiftyeighth issue on the Seventeenth day of February in this year of Grace One Thousand\nNine Hundred and Sixty-one, it was decided that only one course of action was\nleft open to Free-thinking Imperials \u2014\nthat of replying.\nIt a ppe sars that the a fore mentioned\nIrvine would be better foisted upon the\nUm^vers it y lat Oxfbrd since he appears\nto advocate the philosophy of one immortal\nDon, that \"Yea may be turned into Nay\nand vice-ve is a if a sufficient quantity of\nword age is applied to the matter.\" Perhaps we might recall to Mr. Irvine's mind (?) the other two gems of wis don. upon which that University is founded\n\u2014 that \"In any argument the Victor is\nalways right.\" and \"Although the pen is\nmightier than the sword, the sword speaks\nmightier and louder at any given moment-''\nThfe afb re sai'd Irvine's com met nts on\nthe cartoon if ero us nature of the above\nmentioned Hallowed Pages merely shows\nhis ignorance of the fact that the addition of a certain cartoon character (One\nYogi Bear) to the pages of one of our National Newspapers, in two weeks, tripled\nits circulation.\nThe authors also fail to see with what\nauthority Mr. Irvine comments on the\nLiterary Merit of the articles adorning the\nHallowed Pages of the first part.\nIf after reading this note, some-one\ns hold say an unkind word, strike a friend\nor cause distress then we feel that we\nwill not have entirely wasted a Mathematics Tutorial.\nFinally, we may leave our readers, if\nany, and Mr. Irvine, with this thought\n\"A person over pension able age not being an insured person, shall be treated\nas an employed person if he would be\nan insured person were he under pension-able age and would be an employed were\nhe an insured person.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn R. Maddison\nJames C. Ingram\nAs a partially finished product of one\nof the largest degree factories in the country I wish to complain about the storage\narrangements between processing stages.\nIt is quite obvious that the majority of\nproducts are missing the required stress\nrelieving processes and therefore leaving\nthe factory as faulty goods.\nIn short the amount of hostel ac como da tim available at this College is ap-peal ling. Many have been the discussions\nrecently as to how the Union can improve\nthe state of collegiate life but let's be\nhonest, however, many College clubs\nthere are and however, many affiliations\nthe Union makes with other societies, unless the fresher is brought intimately into contact with them it is unrealistic to\nexpect him to take any strong interest.\nThe great majority of freshmen come\nfrom secondary, technical and similar\nschools and they cannot possibly be expected to educate themselves socially. A strong deterrent to those willing to do so\nis the time spent travelling between Colledge and lodgings, iti being impossible\nto obtain these locally without paying\nex h orbit ant rents.\nThe authorities proudly state that by\n1965 a proportion of one third of all\nstudents will be living in, one is half inclined to treat this as a joke. What is\ndesirable is a living in proportion of at\nleast two thirds, if this was achieved the\nUnion really would begin to function r.s it should. Apart from Union activities another necessary requirement, an done that\ncould be begun at present, is an effective\ntutoring system throughout the College^\nIt is appreciated that the staff have their\nown lives and work to consider but it is\nnot difficult now to detect a certain dis-interested ness in student affairs, but this\nis another subject.\nIt will be argued that hostels will cost\na great deal of money and that we are\nin ho position to do anything about it,\nbut is this really so? The additional sum\nrequired to remedy the situation compared\nwith the millions the Government is now\npouring out to rebuilt the College is fractional and the benefit gained by the stud-ents, and thus by industry, would be im-measurable. Would it really be im posible, by concerted effort, to make the Government see this? Clearly the benefits gained,\neven if the money were forthcoming,\nwould not be experienced by those of us\nnow at Imperial College but surely this\nis something wu rth working tor and something also that would show that we are\nonly human, in the most decent and honourable sen Be. That, in my analogy, the College will\nremain a factory even if improved, is not\naccidental for let us not forget that the\nGovernment is financing it primarily in\nan attempt to sate the greed of industry\nand not to satisfy the more complex needs\nof civilised society.\nN. Harmer\nAn open letter to the Hon Seo I.C. Squash Club.\nDear Sir,\n20th February, 1961.\nViewpoints COMMENT. by John Cox\nYours faithfully\nA.. Logan\nWhen considering any issue it is useful to consider whether one is expressing\na viewpoint ahead of, or behind, current\nopinion. It is fairly certain that ones viewpoint will be modified more rapidly if\none holds the current opinion of dynamic\nissue than if one adopts either the 'pro-gres sive' or the 'reactionary' view. The\ninteresting fact is that very few people\nnotice when their views change, they usually think their viewpoint remains constant for all time.\nA few years ago, there was considerable\ncontroversy about whether students\nshould receive a grant at all. Nowadays\n99 per cent accept the situation without\nquestion. Only five or six years ago it\nwas controversial to suggest that local\nEducational Authorities should pay the\nstate scale of grants. Today it is a matter\nof controversy as to whether grants should\nbe completely uniform, not even subject\nto a Means Test In a fairly short time\nCOUNTER COMMENT\nby R.T.L. Fotheringhnrn\nMr. Cox's mam argument this week\nappears to be that 'progressive' thinkers\nhold views ahead of the Establishment\nand by 'reactions move' forward. This process is, in fact, remarkably similar to\nthe lever rule, in that the smaller the\ngroup the more violently and aggressively\n'progressive' they must be to move the\ngreat dough-like unthinking mass \u2014 or so\nwe are expected to believe, There is one\ngreat fallacy in this proposition ; this fallacy\ncentres on the work think. Neither the progressives nor the reactionaries think before striking. Their stands are not based\non the results of their thinking.\nThe lever situation described above arises purely from political expediency. As\nsoon as the progressives have edged the\nreactionaries forward they immediately\nleap ahead again and howl once more\nabout backwardness, despite, the fact that\nthe react in aries now hold !hat position so\nrecently held by the progressives them-selves.\nIf either of these groups thought about\na problem instead of striking characteristic poses, the v would decide on a sol ut ion, work, to achieve it\u201e and then abide\nby it.\nI predict the major controversy will be\non the issue of a Central Grant Awarding Authority for all Britain with grants\nbeing automatic upon acceptance to University. In effect, by 1970, I except the\narguments will be about whether studying shall be considered like a job, with\na wage being paid as for any other full-time occupation.\nMy complaint about I.C. is that our\nthinking is consistently behind the current opinion for students in Britain. The\nnormal procedure is that students thinking leads to N.U.S. pressure on the Government which leads to a Government\nReport which leads to furthur N.U.S. pressure add finally Government action.\nWhen we have a proper University attitude we will be initiating thoughts at I.C., not as at present, thinking about the Means\nTest after a Royal Commission has decide in our favour.\nI wish to quer ry recent and present booking of the squash courts on two grounds.\n1. The extraordinary upsurge in the\nfrequency of matches.\n2. The surely regrettable practice of inserting a squash match booking at a late\ndate, overruling members' existing bookings and not even offering the courtesy\nof informing them of the alterations.\nTh first point could be regarded as a most praise-worthy example of enthusiasm\nin an Athletic Union Club. I have no wish\nto underestimate the importance of competitive sport, or rather the importance\nmany people attach to competitive sport.\nPerhaps, though, squash is not an appropriate sport for such an at tiu de where\nthe numbers of courts is severely limited.\nCertainly a sense of balance is lacking at\npresent. Considering the times when the\ns nu aish courts are not in demand, i.e. weekdays evenings, a quick look at the\nooo ki hgs for the four weeks between January 30th and' February 24 th gives a total of three club nights and 11 matches\n(one of which was scratched at a late\ndate). I.e. members could not book a game\nfor 14 evenings in 20.\nI suggest that\" the second point is a matter of incredibly autocratic behaviour\nand that this is quite indefensible. I doubt\nthat I am the only member to weary rf\nthis treatment but I will restrict myself\nto my own experience. After having a booking (made 6 days in advance) for\nFebruary 14 th deleted in favour of a match, Ire booked for February 23rd requesting I be informed if this booking\ntoo were altered. I notice today that a match has indeed been inserted, my booking deleted and yet I received no notice\nwhatever. Does the person responsible for\nthis behaviour enjoy misusing his powers of\noffice to demonstrate his ascendancy above\nmere club members? There is quick remedy for this. I believe that all Union\nmembers are appreciative of those who\ndevote time and energy to filling the.\nposts which must be filled for the Union\nto run well, but equally, all members are\nquick to resent high-handed behaviour on\nthe part of elected officials. In this case\nonly a little courtesy is required and perhaps more responsible attitude.\nThe Squash Club contains a large number of members, relatively few of whom\nare interested in representative matches\n(how man y spectators support these\nevents?) and all of whom are entitled to\nsome consideration from their governing\nofficials. We enjoy playing squash and\nwish to know why we are being barred from\ndoing so.\nYours sincerely,\nA. Lew\nWe again have the complaint that I.C. thinking is 'behind' that of other students.\nCould it not be that I.C. has thought\nabout the problem and come to a con-clu sion? There is then no point in chasing\nevery new kite flown by so-called leaders\nof student opinion. In fact, if we wait long\nenough these enlightened gentlemen will\ncompete the full circle and catch us up.\nI am always amused to read that the\nmighty N.U.S. pressure forces the Government to set' up Royal Commissions\nand take action contrary to its own des-i res. Perhaps if we have an I.C. March\non Whitehall and the Government will\nbe terrified into resigning. After all this\nwould be the epi to my of democratic gov-ern ment. In enclosing I wish to say that I agree\nwith Mr. Cox's view that all students\naccepted at University should automatically get a grant and that this grant\nshould be standard throughout the country.\nI only hope that when this system is fully\nestablished Mr. Cox will not change his\nviews and start campaigning for further\nreforms just for the sake of being 'pro-gres sive'.= PHOTOGRAPHIC=\nEXHIBITION\nby R.F. Cheeney\nThe first impression of the exhibition\norganised by the Photographic Society\nthis year was that it suffered from being\ncramped. Too mari y exhibition stands were\ncrowded into too little space.\nTechnically speaking the quality of the\nprints was high. However, too little\nthought and care had been put into the\nmounting of the prints and in many cases\nthis was positively scrappy. \"Several photographs were without names or titles.\nThe subject of both the prints and the\ncolour transparencies seemed to lack inspiration except in one or two isolated\ncases. The colour transparencies especially\ntended rather to Ie \"snapshots\" than seriously composed pictures. With regard to\nthe prints it seems that to much attention\nhad been paid to the well established rules\nof photography. A little originality would\nhave done much to enhance the exhibition. After all, if photography is to be\ntreated as an art form then is should include an element of self-expression.\n\n"
