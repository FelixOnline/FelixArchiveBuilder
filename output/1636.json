I must have\nappeared to be either half asleep, or\ndeep in thought pondering upon\nthe underlying philosophy of a\nradiative heat transfer problem.\nHangry, more like. I was craving\nsomething naughty, something\nunique, something that tasted\nlike home. After five minutes of\nfollowed by a confident march up\nnorth from Piccadilly Circus, I\narrived at the simplistic exterior\npainted a calming light grey,\nexpecting to see a queue so long\nthat it would question my reasoning\nbehind coming here in the first\nplace. Normally, especially during\nweekends, the queue would start on\nthe street opposite and stretch far\naround the corner. Wait. No queue?\nI must have been dreaming.\nAccepting my luck with gratitude\nand joy, I walked in and was shown\nto a seat by the clean, wooden bar\ntable. A one-page, A5 size menu\nfollowed, highlighting all their\nsignature dishes with beautiful\nartwork and also an old-school tick-sheet for you to input the quantity\nof each dish you desire.\nThe menu at their Soho site has\ndeveloped much more since their\nstreet stall days. Nevertheless, it is\nshortandsweet,easytoread,nofrills,\nno fancy language and no hidden\ncosts. They still have a good range\nof seven snacks, six types of Bao and\nfour sides. Everything dazzles and\nis extremely tempting, despite some\nitems being more exotic than what\nthe normal Londoner is used to:\npig blood cake, trotter nuggets, kale\nsalad with salted egg. Don\u2019t expect\none Bao to fill you up \u2013 it\u2019s only the\nsize of a palm. And given the many\ntempting choices here you wouldn\u2019t\nwant to leave with just one in your\nbelly anyway. Think of their dishes\nas tapas.\nDrinks-wise, as their small,\nflavourful dishes team up so\nbeautifully with a beer, especially\nafter a long day at work (in Chinese\nwe call them Xia Jiu Cai), a variety\nAbove: BAO. Top to bottom; Classic Bao, with braised pork and peanut; Fried Chicken Bao; Pigs blood cake with soy cured egg yolk; Horlicks ice cream on sweet Bao. Photo Credit: Christy Lam\nChristy Lam\nWriter\nBAO is\neverything\nI ever\nneeded in\nlife\ndesperate scrolling up and down my\nInstagram feed, I got an answer.\nBAO, created by Erchen Chang\nand brother and sister Shing Tat\nand Wai Ting Chung, started off\nas a miniscule travelling street stall\nwith Street Feast and Kerb. Many\nloyal customers, awards and baos\nlater,they secured a regular Saturday\ntrading spot at Netil Market, then\nfinally in 2015, transitioned into a\npermanent site in Soho.\nDespite being surrounded by\nthe fast changing food trend, they\nstuck to their two signature dishes:\nGua Bao and their Taiwanese fried\nchicken, called Xian Su Ji. If you\u2019ve\nnever heard of a Gua Bao before,\nit\u2019s a popular Taiwanese snack\nconsisting of a thick slice of braised\npork belly sandwiched between a\nfolded, steamed bun.\nBack to the story. After a high\nspeed powerwalk session from\ncollege straight to South Kensington\nUnderground, an impatient four\nstop journey on the Piccadilly line\nof beers, ciders and sake are\navailable. If you are looking for an\nauthentic Taiwanese experience\nfor your tastebuds, go for a can of\nTaiwan beer! Or go for a pot of\ntheir Oolong tea.\nAll that research on Instagram\nreduced my menu ticking activity\nto less than ten seconds. I quickly\nshoved the sheet to the waitress and\nsat waiting with high hopes.\nFirst off, the Classic Bao (\u00a34).\nThe heavenly combination of the\npillowy soft, melt-in-the-mouth\nsteamed bun and the tender,\nflavourful braised pork was finished\noff with lashings of fragrant peanut\npowder and coriander. Wipes are\navailable so feel free to dig in with\nyour hands.\nNext up, the Fried Chicken Bao\n(\u00a35). A compromise for anyone\nwanting to try the fried chicken\nwithout having just plain fried\nchicken. BAO\u2019s fried chicken\nis truly one-of-a-kind. A light,\ncrumbly, crunchy soy milk batter\nencasing tender, juicy bitesize\npieces of chicken, seasoned with\nmouthwatering spices. The addition\nof the Sichuan mayonnaise and the\nkimchi all sandwiched between a\nblack sesame bao is everything I\never needed in life.\nOut of curiosity, I went for a\nportion of Pig Blood Cake (\u00a33.50)\n\u2013 a rectangular cousin of the British\nblack pudding and a common street\nfood not only in Taiwan, but also in\nChina and Korea. BAO\u2019s version,\nbased on the Asian style blood\ncake, comes mixed with glutinous\nrice and fried until it\u2019s crispy on the\noutside, yet wonderfully moist and\nchewy inside. As horrifying as this\nmay sound to some, it\u2019s delicious\nand you definitely can\u2019t taste any\nblood. Rich, savoury, and rounded\noff by that gorgeous runny soy-cured egg yolk.\nA meal is never a meal without\ndessert. The only dessert item\navailable is their fried Horlicks ice\ncream Bao (\u00a34). The fried bao is\nslightly sweetened with a texture like\na brioche or a doughnut.A generous\nscoop of their light, malty Horlicks\nice cream melts slowly between the\nbao, forming a magical harmony\nbetween contrasting temperatures\nand textures.\nAside from my choices, other\npopular items include the aged beef\nrump cap, which is basically thin\nslices of tender beef marinated in\nsoy sauce. For vegetarians, the spicy\nfried daikon (radish) bao, sweet\npotato chips and kale salad are\navailable.\nI arrived hungry and left fully\nsatisfied, my taste buds swimming\nin umami, without having broken\nthe bank. What\u2019s led to BAO\u2019s\nsuccess is simple, sincere, down-to-earth, good food.\n\n"

Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nOn the verge of a global health crisis\nDr Wilko Duprez\nWriter\nW\ne do desperately\nneed new\nantibiotics,\u201d said\nDr. Andrew\nEdwards, a lecturer at Imperial\nCollege London and group leader\nat the Medical Research Centre\nfor Molecular Bacteriology and\nInfection. \u201cWhat we have seen\nrecently is the emergence of some\nstrains [genetic variants of bacterial\nspecies] resistant to all of our\ndifferent types of antibiotics,\u201d he\nadded.\n\u201cOne of the big problems with\nantibiotics is that every time we\nmake a new one, then we select\nfor the bacteria that can survive in\nits presence. Every time we make\na new antibiotic, very rapidly we\nsee resistance arising and that has\nbeen happening since penicillin,\u201d\ncommented Dr. Gwenan Knight, an\nImperial biomathematician looking\nfor patterns in drug-resistance\ndevelopment and dissemination in\nthe community.\nThe concerns about antibiotic\nresistance are nothing new \u2013\nwould be much more catastrophic if\ndrastic changes are not implemented\nsoon.\nThe 18-month study forecasts\nthat by 2050, superbugs would be\nresponsible for 10 millions deaths\na year, the equivalent of one patient\nevery three seconds, overtaking the\ndeath toll from cancer.\nAccordingtothereport,thebiggest\ncontributors to antibiotic resistance\nare the large-scale use of antibiotics\nin animal breeding in a preventive\ntherapeutic action (including last-resort antibiotics),the little incentive\nfor pharmaceutical companies to\ndevelop new drugs and the lack of\naccurate diagnostic tools for doctors\nto pinpoint the source of infection\nin patients. The latter leads to\nantibiotics being prescribed against\ninfections that could stem from\nviruses against which the drugs have\nno effects.\nThereportistryingtoaddressthese\nissues with a series of proposals for\nfuture antibiotic development and\nusage which, although welcomed,\nmight not act as straightforward\nas expected. For example, while\nit suggests to drastically restrict\nantibiotic consumption in animal\nbreeding, according to Dr. Knight\n\u201cThe Netherlands have been really\ngood at decreasing use of antibiotics\nin agriculture, and they haven\u2019t yet\nseen the decrease in clinical drug\nresistance in hospitals.\u201d\nSecondly, when it comes to the\neconomic burden and the financing\nof R&D, the report suggests a\nmonetary injection of 40 billion\nUSD (approximately 27 billion\npounds) every decade. However,\nthe origin of the funding remains\na subject of debate Among the\nsolutions proposed, the most\ncontroversial would be a tax on\npharmaceutical company revenues\nto create a new pool of funding for\nantibiotic research. This measure\nFelix finds out what Imperial researchers really think\nThis week\u2019s science picture\nNatasha Khaleeq\nWriter\nF\nor 107 hours Portugal ran\non renewable energy alone.\nFrom the 7th\nto the 11th\nMay\nthe country\u2019s electricity\nconsumption was completely\ncovered by renewable sources. Data\nanalysis of national energy network\nfigures revealed this.The Portuguese\ndesire for clean energy was\nencouraged by the EU\u2019s renewable\ntargets for 2020 and the UK also\nhad their first ever week of coal-free\nelectricity two weeks ago.Oliver Joy,\na spokesman for the Wind Europe\ntrade association said: \u201cThe Iberian\npeninsula is a great resource for\nrenewables and wind energy, not\njust for the region but for the whole\nof Europe.\u201d So industry groups are\nfocusing on green energy\u2019s export\npotential. With the right policies in\nplace wind energy alone could meet\na quarter of Europe\u2019s power needs\nin the next 15 years. Inflexible and\npolluting technologies are ending.\nThe time has come for clean,\nrenewable sources.\nI\nt is the 17th\nMarch 2011 and\nthere is a distant humming\nfrom the sky over the\nWaziristan mountains, on\nthe border between Pakistan and\nAfghanistan. Is it a bird? Is it a\nplane? No, it is an unmanned aerial\nvehicle (a drone to you and me) that\nis about to fire three missiles into a\ncommunity meeting.\nIn this case the drone with its\nlaser-guided missile remained\nfaithful to its original military use,\nkilling 40 civilians in a misinformed\nattempt to assassinate a Taliban\nsenior.\nFirst entering the skies in the\nlate 1800s in balloon form, drones\nhave since been intensely researched\nand developed by the U.S. army.\nNowadays these unmanned, aircraft\ncome in an array of shapes and sizes.\nThey are used to investigate hard-to-reach places, such as the sheets\nof ice on the Arctic Ocean, and\nare pre-programmed to carry out a\nmission or controlled by pilots on\nthe ground.\nTheir versatility is a result of the\non-board machinery that make\ndrones specific to their task. In an\nArctic ice mission for example, the\ndrone carries scientific instruments\nsuch as cameras capable of detecting\nvisible and infrared light. This\nallows scientists to see the structure\nof disintegrating ice in areas where\nit would otherwise be perilous\nto tread. Military weapons and\nclimate scientists aside, drones\nhave found another friend: the\n3-D printer. In February, Dr Mirko\nKovac and his team at Imperial\nCollege London, together with\npartners at Bath University, UCL\nand the Dyson robotics lab, received\n\u00a33.4 million for a project involving\naerial construction-bots, this time\narming drones with 3-D printing\ntechnology.\n\u201cThese autonomous [self-directing] vehicles that are able to\nprecisely deposit structural material\nhas already been criticized by\nthe Association of the British\nPharmaceutical industry, and might\nevolve in a national tax on antibiotic\nproducts instead. But both\nsuggestions are highly contested by\nscientists.\n\u201cThere\u2019s two problems: firstly\npharmaceutical companies already\nspend a small amount on antibiotic\ndiscovery, so taxing them would\nlimit the amount of revenues they\nhave available,\u201d commented Dr.\nEdwards. \u201cSecondly, because we\nhave a National Health Service,\ntaxing them [antibiotics] is just\ngoing to cost the taxpayer more to\nbuy these drugs.\u201d\nThe report is also proposing\nas a measure the adoption of an\nappropriate diagnosis prior to any\nantibiotic prescription, by 2020 in\ndeveloped countries. The problem\nis that such diagnostic tests do not\nyet exist, or are not fast enough to\nidentify infections like meningitis\nthat develops extremely quickly.\nThe fight against superbugs is\nextremely complex; there still\nremain many unanswered questions\nregarding the epidemiology\nof antibiotic resistant bacteria\nand many of the researchers at\nImperial are trying to tackle\nthem. For instance, as part of\nthe Antimicrobial Research\nCollaborative, Dr. Edwards\u2019\nlaboratory is trying to recycle\noutdated antibiotics by remodelling\nthem with better efficiency and\ncountering existing drug resistance\nmechanisms. He is also looking\ninto disabling superbugs\u2019 natural\ndefences for the immune system\nto clear out infections without the\nhelp of antibiotics. Dr. Knight, in\nan Imperial-based NIHR-funded\nresearch unit, is trying to figure\nout using mathematical models\nthe source of superbug infections.\nShe explained: \u201cIn England we use\nabout 80% of our antibiotics in the\ncommunity and 20% in hospitals,\nbut we don\u2019t actually know where\nmost antibiotic resistance is being\ngenerated.\u201d\nThe alarming O\u2019Neill report is\na source of controversy not only\nwithin academia but also within\nthe business sector, but there is\none thing everyone agrees on: the\ncrisis is imminent and there is an\nimmediate need for global action on\nrather than just national policies.\u201cIf\nAnticipated human death toll from antibiotic resistance in 2050.

However, a\nnew governmental report released\nlast week by Jim O\u2019Neill, the\nCommercial Secretary to the\nTreasury,predicts that consequences\nIn England\nwe use\nabout 80%\nof our\nantibiotics\nin the\ncommunity\nand 20% in\nhospitals\nwe happened to control antibiotic\nresistance just in the UK, it is going\nto be introduced from somewhere\nelse around the world,\u201d concluded\nDr. Knight.\nThousands of glass fermentation\nvessels like this one were used\nin Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline)\nlaboratories to produce penicillin.\nPhoto Credit: Welcome Images\nTheir\nversatility\nis a result\nof the onboard\nmachinery\nfrom the air, could manufacture\nbuildings and repair infrastructure\nelements.\u201dsays Dr Kovac,a specialist\nin aerial robotics.\nThe process followed by these\n\u201cbuilder robots\u201d is called Additive\nBuilding Manufacturing (ABM)\nwhere drones excrete materials to\nbuild structures.

Photo Credit: FELIX\nthey were still at school.\nHe compared the astronomical\ninterest rates, which have been\nretroactively increased since the\n2012 cohort signed their contracts\nwith the Student Loans Company,\nto those of personal loans and\nmortgages. Currently, the 3.9%\ninterest he and thousands of others\nare paying is far higher than the\nrates on standard personal loans or\nmortgages.\nIn the letter, Crowther said that\nhe felt \u201ccheated\u201d and complained\nthat he and others students in his\nyear had \u201ctrusted the government\nthat the interest rate would remain\nlow \u2013 at around 0%-0.5%\u201d.\nHowever, even during his degree,\nthe interest was 3% plus inflation.\nStudents don\u2019t have to start paying\nback their loans until they start\nearning over \u00a321,000, but during\nthis time interest is being added\nat 0.9%. Once you earn enough to\nstart repayments, the interest rate\ncan rise up to 3.9% if you\u2019re earning\n\u00a341,000 or more.\nStudents who started university\nbefore 2012,have their interest rates\nset at 0.9% \u201cuntil further notice\u201d\naccording to the Student Loans\nCompany.\nLast November, the government\nannounced that it would be freezing\nthe repayment threshold of \u00a321,000\na year rather than increasing that\nfigure with inflation, meaning low\nand middle earners will pay back\nmore. Martin Lewis, the founder\nof moneysavingexpert.com, who\nwas on the government\u2019s board for\nstudent finance in 2011, announced\nat the end of last year that he was\nindependently hiring a team of\nlawyers to investigate these changes.\nGRACE RAHMAN\n\n"

Photo Credit: AMC\nA new slew of characters take on the apocalypse. Photo Credit: AMC\nE\nver since it was introduced,\nThe Walking Dead\u2019s\npopularity has soared\nthrough the roof. Another\nZombie apocalypse styled story,\nthe franchise has a comic book, TV\nseries, video game, and now, with\nFear the Walking Dead, a spin-off\nTV series. With the main show still\nairing and already in place however,\nit begs the question, does this show\nadd anything new and substantially\ndifferent?\nThe short answer is yes: there\u2019s\nenough to differentiate this spin-off\nseries from the adventures of Rick\nGrimes and company in Atlanta.\nFear the Walking Dead takes place\non the other side of the United\nStates and features completely new\nand different characters to root for\n(and eventually weep tears for). The\nmost significant difference however,\nis the fact that it takes place in the\nearly days of the apocalypse; we get\nto see a normal functioning society\ndescend into chaos and disorder.\nThis was a time period skipped\nover in the original series as it went\nstraight into the action.\nThe premise alone does make this\nshow intriguing and engaging to\nwatch. Who doesn\u2019t want to see the\nbig and bustling metropolis of Los\nAngeles descend into chaos? As the\nshow goes forward, we see the first\nzombies make their presence felt.\nIt\u2019s a slow burn from a seemingly\nnormal day to a society where law\nand order breaks down altogether.\nThe show is wracked with tension\nand suspense as events happen one\nafter another and things escalate\nto new heights. There are several\neffective moments which detail the\nfall of a city, from cops taking down\na zombie on a freeway, to a SWAT\nteam surrounding a hospital.\nThe main characters of the show\nare part of a large and dysfunctional\nfamily group. For the most part,\neveryone is written like real and\nbelievable characters. However, a\ncouple of them are teenagers, and\nwith this, we get the cliche and\nannoying problems that come with\nthem. One of the characters, Nick\nClark, is a heroin addict who finds\nhimself suffering from withdrawal\nsymptoms and is constantly trying\nto get a fix, scavenging through\npeople\u2019s medicine cabinets. Another\ncharacter, Christopher, is the typical\nrebellious teenager: difficult at times\nand resentful of his father\u2019s divorce.\nThe dysfunctional family unit\nmeant that there was also some\nunwanted drama between ex-wives\nand difficulty with cooperation\nin general. However, eventually,\neveryone is able to band together and\nwork against the craziness around\nthem. Not everyone makes it to the\nend, obviously, but characters are\nable to shed some of their annoying\nquirks as things go on.\nHowever, before people start\nworking together, a giant ditch of\ndumb decision takes place. As is\nusually common with the survival\nhorror genre, characters act like\nboneheads at times and as viewers,\nthis is especially frustrating to watch.\nFor example, near the beginning,\nsome characters with more\nexperience refuse to have stark and\nserious conversations about what\u2019s\nbeen going on. The whole \u2018in the\ndark\u2019 aspect acts like an unnerving\nsecurity blanket in season one,\nwhere people don\u2019t know things and\nhave information kept from them\nwhich leads to an infuriating block\nof central characters.\nI don\u2019t want to sound too negative\nbut the dumb decisions and choices\nare a semi-regular occurrence, and\nthese are what ultimately hampers\nthe show from becoming much\ngreater than what it currently is.\nOccasionally there\u2019s some good\nstuff done by the characters here\nand there and when they deal with\nthe fallout of their actions, it can be\nrefreshing to watch.\nAmidst these bad choices, there\nis a great deal of good stuff that\ncomes out which makes everything\nworth it. Some of the characters are\ncompelling and have interesting\nback stories that reveal what makes\nthem tick. Two which stand out\nthe most are Colman Domingo\nas Victor Strand, a shady ex-businessman who is basically this\nshow\u2019s Carol (main series badass)\nand Rub\u00e9n Blades as Daniel Salazar,\na Salvadoran refugee who would\nprotect his family at any cost.\nThe setting also changes as the\ncharacters move around, each with\nits own style and charm. Along the\nway, new characters show up that\nwe get to meet (and watch die).\nIn addition, the story moves in\ninteresting and unique directions\nwhich grab your attention and\nmake you want to see how things go\nalong.For example,there\u2019s an escape\non a yacht! How that happens and\nwhere it leads to is something that\nleaves you wanting more.\nFear the Walking Dead may have\nseemed like an unnecessary spin-off\nat first, but it has grown to become\nits own unique thing. While some\nchoices and plot elements can\nbe frustrating to watch, there is\nultimately more good done than\nbad. With the second season\ncurrently airing and the show\nhaving been renewed for a third, it\nis definitely interesting to see how\nthese particular group of survivors\nwill fare in the zombie apocalypse.\nFear the Walking Dead is available\non Amazon Prime and Hulu\nThe story\nmoves in\ninteresting\nand unique\ndirections\nwhich\ngrab your\nattention\nSaad Ahmed\nTV Editor We get\nto see a\nnormal\nfunctioning\nsociety\ndescend\ninto chaos\nand disorder\nimperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on\nfriday 27 May\ncoming up!\nCHILL, HIP HOP, HOUSE, FUTURE BASS AND DNB\nt\nVenue Regular Events Time Day\nMetric & FiveSixEight Common People 20:00 - 02:00 Friday 27 May\nFiveSixEight Super Quiz 20:00 - 22:00 Every Tuesday\nMetric Cocktail Night 18:00 - 23:00 Every Tuesday\nMetric & FiveSixEight CSP Wednesday 19:00 - 01:00 Every Wednesday\nMetric & FiveSixEight Club Night 20:00 - 02:00 Every Friday\nh-bar Pub Quiz 19:00 - 21:00 2nd & 4th Thursday\nh-bar PGI Friday 16:00 onwards Every Friday\nReynolds Quiz Night 19:00 - 23:00 Every Monday\nReynolds Board Games & Film Night 18:00 - 23:00 Every Tuesday\nReynolds Pool Club 18:00 - 23:00 Every Wednesday\nReynolds Pizza Club 18:00 - 23:00 Every Thursday\nReynolds Cocktail Club 17:30 - 01:00 Every Friday\nThe Foundry Quiz Night 19:30 - 22:00 1st & 3rd Thursday\nCOCKTAIL CLUB\nimperialcollegeunion.org/food-drink\nEvery Friday from 20 May, starts 17:30\nBuy two cocktails for \u00a37.60\nimperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on\nFRIDAY 27 MAY\n20:00 - 02:00\nMETRIC & FIVESIXEIGHT\n\u00a31.50 Guestlist\n\u00a32.50 On the door\n\u00a32.00 With an Entertainments Card\nA NIGHT OF 90S AND 00S\nINDIE, ROCK AND BRIT\nPOP FLOORFILLERS!\nFree entry to the first 25\npeople who post their song\nchoice on the wall!\n\n"

You see, Big Edie\nwas the aunt of Jacqueline Onassis,\nthe widow of JFK, and America\u2019s\nall-round sweetheart, making Little\nEdie her cousin. But while Jackie O\nwas living a life of luxury, the Edies\nhad fallen from grace spectacularly.\nCooped up in the mansion with\ninnumerable cats and an infestation\nof raccoons, the two women fight\nand bicker, screeching at each\nother in high-class New York\naccents; their relationship is one of\ncomplete dependence \u2013 despite all\ntheir fighting, it is clear that neither\nwould last long without the other.\nBoth had dreams of stardom \u2013 Big\nEdie with a singing career, Little\nEdie with her dancing \u2013 but now\nthey are confined to showing off\nto the Maysles, who are afforded a\nprivileged glance into their world.\nBig Edie spends much of her time\nin her bed, eating boiled corn and\np\u00e2t\u00e9, so it\u2019s Little Edie who eats up\nthe majority of screen-time. She\u2019s\na true eccentric; coming out of the\nhouse one morning, she talks the\nbrothers through her outfit:\u2018the best\nthing is to wear pantyhose, under a\nshort skirt, and then you can pull\nthe stockings up over the pants, and\nyou can always take off the skirt\nand use it as a cape\u2026so I think this\nis the best costume of the day\u2026\nmother wanted me to come out in\na kimono, so we had quite a fight\u2019.\nThe whole film is shot through with\nsuch moments, from her reading\nher astrology book \u2013 \u2018all I have to\ndo is find this Libra man\u2019\u2013 to telling\nus about her interests \u2013 \u2018I only care\nabout three things: the Catholic\nChurch, swimming, and dancing\u2019\n\u2013 everything Little Edie says is a\ncomplete gem.\nBut ultimately,Little Edie is much\nmuch more than just a collection\nof quotes and quirks wearing a\nheadscarf: she\u2019s a living, breathing\nperson, one whose life has been\npeppered with disappointment,\ndespondency, and unfulfilled\ndreams. The Maysles treat her and\nher mother with complete respect,\nconferring the women a dignity\nthat the press would not offer them.\nWhile some would call their work\nexploitative, the softly-spoken\npresences behind the camera are\nso adept at letting us see the Edies\u2019\nworld, allowing us to empathise\ndeeply with them, that the finished\nresult is one of admiration and\ncomplete acceptance.

This water is contributing\nto the melting of the glacier, and\nif it retreats a mere 150km more, it\nwill trigger a rapid retreat of up to\n300km due to the interaction with\nthe sedimentary rocks below. Now,\nthis 300km retreat may take several\ncenturies, but once this threshold\nLara Bailey\nWriter\nA\nt the end a of whitewashed hallway on\nthe second floor of\nthe RSM building,\nDr Matthew Genge has been\nunlocking the mysteries of the\nuniverse through his research on\nmicrometeorites \u2013 otherwise known\nas cosmic dust. Last week however,\nGenge published a paper in Nature\nwhich opened some doors to\nunderstanding Earth\u2019s secrets, and\nhas potentially turned some age-old\nscientific theories on their head.\nIt\u2019s commonly thought our early\natmosphere had little to no oxygen,\nand was mostly carbon dioxide\nlike the choking atmospheres of\nVenus and Mars are now. However,\n2.4 billion years ago, in the Great\nOxygenation Event, ocean bacteria\nbegan multiplying and heavily\nbreathing,, bringing our atmosphere\nto the familiar, comfortable level of\n21% oxygen.\nThis accepted view is now\nchallenged based on the discovery\nof 60 micrometeorites found in\nthe arid Pilbara region of western\nAustralia, dated at 2.7 billion years\nold, 300 million years before this\noxygenation event. These tiny\nrocks were found to contain iron\noxide, which had been transformed\nfrom traces of metallic iron. This\nelemental change must have\nrequired high levels of oxygen which\nthe comet was exposed to as it fell\nthrough our atmosphere. These\nlevels though are not supported by\nour current theories on the earth\u2019s\nearly atmosphere.\nAfter studying the dust and\nrunning mathematical models,\nGenge and his team realised the\ndata unavoidably pointed to an\noxygen rich atmosphere. As all\nprevious research supported the\ntheory of oxygen-starved lower\natmosphere, it was time for\nGenge and his colleagues to think\ndifferently about early atmospheric\ncomposition: \u201cWe looked at the\ndata in the papers saying oxygen\nwas very poor in abundance at low\naltitude, and we couldn\u2019t fault it \u2013\nthat looks as if it\u2019s true. Our data\nlooks as if it\u2019s true that there\u2019s lots\nof oxygen in the upper atmosphere,\ntherefore we need to come up with\na way of separating the lower and\nupper atmosphere.\u201d\nBased on the evidence in the\ncosmic dust, the scientists theorised\nthere must have been an oxygen rich\nupper atmosphere that was likely\nCosmic dust hints at alternate history\nis crossed, the stability of the rest\nof the glacier, moreover the East\nAntarctic Ice Sheet, will be left to\nthe mercy of the elements.\nThe retreat would become\nunstoppable, causing a sea level\nrise of around 2.9m from this\nglacier alone. The theory behind\nthis pattern of rapid retreat comes\nfrom studying the geology of the\nNaomi Stewart\nWriter\nseparated by a thin methane haze\nfrom the lower atmosphere. This\nmethane layer would have prevented\nmixing between the two, which\nwould explain the data supporting\nthe oxygen poor lower atmosphere.\nWhere the oxygen came from is still\nunclear; the current working theory\nis that the sun\u2019s UV rays split CO2,\nbut more research has yet to be done\nto figure out why.\nIn the meantime, Genge says\nrocks below the glacier. Following\npatterns of retreat and advance,\nevidence from geophysical surveys\nsuggests much more rapid retreat\nwhen the ice hits more unstable\nregions of rock. These unstable\nregions could again come into play\nwith the increasing rate of retreat.\nThe scale of the EAIS and Totten\nmakes this discovery particularly\nconcerning. Totten itself is around\n220,000 square miles in area, bigger\nthan the US State of California. In\nsome parts the ice is 2.5 miles thick,\nso the potential loss of ice is massive.\nHowever, Totten is dwarfed by the\nsize of the ice sheet it supports: the\nEAIS makes up two thirds of the\nentire Antarctic ice sheet.\nCo-author of the study, Professor\nMartin Siegert,emphasises the need\nfor concern.\u201cThe East Antarctic Ice\nSheet is by far the largest mass of ice\non Earth, so any small changes have\na big influence globally.\"\nthe plan is to keep looking for\nmicrometeorites to study and\n\u201cpotentially do a time sequence and\nsee how the dust changed\u201d. If lucky,\nthey might find whether there were\nany changes in atmospheric oxygen\ncontent 2.7 billion years ago.\nAnd while cosmic dust may seem\nfar removed from our life, Genge\nargues sharing the fascination of\nresearch is key to sparking interest\nin science, which we should keep in\nmind in our studies and research:\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is pushing the\nboundaries of science and coming\nup with these little gems about the\npast that excite people about science.\nI think if you talk to every single\nscientist, we all have an inherent\ninterest in science, but there\u2019s\nusually a book or a newspaper story\nor something, National Geographic\nor something, that made you go:\nWow that\u2019s really cool.\u201d\nWe couldn\u2019t find a micrometeorite, so here is the cosmos instead.

There's a stigma. As put\nby Day,\u201cAlthough you don't see any\nobjective evidence for preventing\nthe research of these drugs, because\nof the whole cultural and moral\nstatus quo you are a bit anxious.\u201d\nIndeed challenging the status quo\ncan cost scientists their careers, as\nwas illustrated by Professor David\nNutt who lost his position as the\ngovernment\u2019s chief drug advisor in\nScience, what\u2019s good?\nAny small\nchanges\nhave a big\ninfluence\nglobally\nAntarctica.

We\u2019re at the\nforefront of an exciting field.\"\nIt\u2019s been many years now since\namphibian communities started\ncollapsing across the world. The\nglobal pattern has made many\nthink that a single culprit lied in\nthe epicentre of the crisis. Yet,\ndespite the adoption of a range of\napproaches, nothing has been able\nto stave off the decline. A team of\nresearchers from the U.S. analysed\namphibian population trends across\nthe continent and assessed the\ndegree to which various threats\ncontributed to the declines. They\nfound that decline rate not only\nvaries from region to region,but also\nthat different factors such as human\nactivity, or pesticide prevalence\nand of course disease (looking at\nyou Chytrid fungus) contributed\nto the decline in different ways.\nUnfortunately the study doesn\u2019t\nprovide a simple fix, quite the\nopposite; it rejects the existence\nof a smoking gun , a single culprit\nand subsequently a single solution.\nThings are complicated and saving\namphibians won\u2019t be easy.\nGrant et al. 2016, Scientific\nReports\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nWhen babies are born\nprematurely, they\u2019re often extremely\nlight and are immediately put in\nan incubator.

However a\nnew study suggests that big babies\nmight also have a higher chance of\nsuffering from cardiovascular disease\nlater on in life. The study looked at\nadolescents aged 14-18 and found\nthat those with birthweight close\nto both ends of the spectrum were\nmore likely to have dangerous fat\naround major organs. However,\nregardless of birthweight, the odds\nmay be reversed with exercise and a\nhealthy diet.The researchers behind\nthe study give familiar advice:\nDon\u2019t smoke when pregnant and\nbreastfeed. The former may stunt\nbabies at birth while the later may\nprovide much needed protection.\nStansfield et al. 2016, Journal of\nPediatrics.\nAre frogs ok\nnow?

The craters were found with\nthe use of the LAMP instrument\naboard the Lunar Reconnaissance\nOrbiter (LRO). LAMP uses the\nfar-ultraviolet Lyman-alpha band\nskyglow and light from ultraviolet-bright stars to \u201csee\u201d in the dark and\nimage the permanently shaded\nregions of the Moon.\nThese craters were particularly\nhard to study due to their immense\ndepth, which makes them really\nhard to catch any light whatsoever.\nThe team also determined their\nage, namely 16 million for one\nand somewhere between 75 and\n420 million years for the other,\nwhich makes them relatively young\ngeologically. The discovery will\nhopefully shed light on the birth of\nour solar system.\nMandt et al. 2016, Icarus\nYellow fever (YF) has for the\nfirst time found its way into Asia.\nThe findings come from a study\nfrom the International Journal of\nInfectious Diseases, which warns\nthat if WHO doesn\u2019t take action,\nwe may risk a progression from an\noutbreak to an epidemic.

Of\nthe college\u2019s eight million, \u00a3817,435\nis invested directly in tobacco firms\nvia this particular fund.\nOf the \u00a35,839,820 Imperial has\ninvested in the Capita Financial\nWoodford Equity income,\u00a3422,219\nis in Imperial Brands, \u00a3350,389\nin British American Tobacco and\n\u00a3204,977 in Reynolds American,\nwho make Pall Mall and Camel\ncigarettes.\nWe\u2019ve invested \u00a33,988,005 in the\nInvesco Perpetual High Income\nfund, 15% of which was invested\nin tobacco firms.

In\nthe run up to the event at London\u2019s\nScala, gig-goers are told that this is\nan evening to \u201close yourself in an\nimmersive journey to the end of\ntime.\u201d The stage is decorated with\npoorly made space-age objects, and\nthe merchandise stand is lined with\nreflective foil as if it were the outside\nofaspace-craft.It\u2019sasifthecollective\nare suggesting they are from the\nfuture, or at least accelerating at the\nspeed of light towards it. I believe\nthis understanding of PC Music is\nincorrect\u2013futuremusicisnotheaded\nin this direction. They are instead a\nreaction to mass consumerism and\nhyper-marketisation, critiquing the\npresent.\nWhile the Danny L Harle might\nhave been top of the bill, this was an\nevening where all of the PC Music\ncollective were equal. Each artist\ntakes to the stage for no more than\n30 minutes.The homogenous nature\nof the net label\u2019s catalogue results in\nan evening where the boundaries\nbetween each artist begin to blur.\nThis is a collection of artists who\nSometimes I wish PC Music were sent on a rocket into space, never to return. Photo Credit: PC Music\nPop Cosmos proves the collective are still kind of relevant\nThis is very important music. Photo Credit: PC Music\nare variations and mutations of each\nother, often coalescing to form new\nprojects.\nThe evening ends with a set from\nHarle, an artist who has quickly\nfound his place at the top of the PC\nsuccess (relative to his PC Music\ncollaborators). At one point Harle\nleaves the comfort of the mixing\ndesk and prances around the stage\nshouting at someone dressed in a\ngreen morph suit. Soon they work\ntogether and throw free \u201chuge\ndanny\u201d t-shirts into the crowd.\nLike good consumers, the crowd\nlap up their free gifts. Does Harle\ndo this to mask the quality of his\nset or is this all part of their hyper-consumerist critique? We\u2019ll likely\nnever know, as the collective are\nincredibly secretive.As his set enters\nits final moments, he picks up an\nelectric guitar and drones into the\ndarkness of the night.\nBefore Harle\u2019s slightly\ndisappointing appearance, A.G.\nCook performs a smaller set of more\nexperimental tracks. His brilliance\nis what holds the collective together,\nand his frequent collaborations\nwith external artists gives him more\ndiverse material for the evening.\nQT (of \u2018Hey QT\u2019fame) drifts across\nthe stage halfway through Cook\u2019s\nperformance, delivering to Cook\nher branded energy drink. It\u2019s an\nultimate tease that never pays off (to\nthe crowd\u2019s disappointment).\nHannah Diamond joins him\nat the 20 minute mark adding\nher child-like vocals to his catchy\nchiptune-like backing tracks.\nBy far the highlight of the evening\nis GFOTY (Girlfriend of the Year),\nwhose set comes off the back off the\nrelease of her latest EP, VIPOTY,\nperforming the same songs as on her\ntour with Animal Collective earlier\nthis year. Energetic, dynamic and\nunhinged, she shares the stage with\ntwo dancers who play off her moves.\nTo the amusement of the room,\nGFOTY starts the her time on stage\nwith \u2018Got My Chad,\u2019 miming with\na high-school prom inspired band.\nSoon after this mock performance\nis finished and the suits are thrown\noff, the real set starts. GFOTY\nscreams and shouts at the audience,\nadmitting that she is no singer.\nHer music is more spoken word\nthan singing and there\u2019s an honesty\nto her lyrics that makes her so\nrefreshing. Each artist that is part of\nthe PC Music project has their own\ndistinctive character, and among\nthese GFOTY is most interesting.\nIt is an obvious parody of lad-culture from a female perspective.\nWhether or not her performance is\nempowering, however, depends on\nyour perspective of casual sex and\nintoxication.GFOTY is no stranger\nto controversy \u2013 with a number of\nunacceptable racist remarks in the\npast \u2013 and her performance reflects\nthis; it is provocative, lyrically and\nin its choreography. As she leaves\nthe stage much of the energy of the\nnight leaves too.\nThe order of the night has\nno relevance. There is no clear\nprogression between the slightly\ndistinct sounds. Others in the\ncollective also make appearances,\nbut the are barely memorable.I once\nthought PC Music were deadly\nserious, but it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re a\njoke \u2013 a parody of popular culture\n\u2013 even if they aren\u2019t willing to admit\nit.\nLike good\nconsumers,\nthe crowd\nlap up their\nfree gifts\nMusic hierarchy. His music is less\nalien and more accessible, compared\nto the obnoxious electronica of\nsome of his peers. While other\nartists in the collective have made\nmusic that seems solely for personal\nconsumption, Harle has written\nand produced tracks that are made\nfor the club. Emblazoned on his\nt-shirts and interspersed throughout\nhis set in the phrase \u201chuge danny.\u201d\nAnd his music adheres to this; it is\nmassive, epic, and \u201chuge\u201din its radio\n\n"

Thereafter, his research-based\nstatements clashed more and more\nwith the government\u2019s political\nstance before he was finally let go\nafter publishing a paper ranking\ndrugs,both legal and illegal,in order\nof harm.

However, these changes would\nhave had to have been approved\nby union council, the governing\nbody of the union made up solely\nof students and sabbs.

Photo Credit: FELIX\nHe\ndiscussed\nthe dangers\nof alcohol\nand its\naccepted\ndanger to\npublic health\nalcohol and its toxic, yet accepted,\ndanger to public health. He spoke\nsolemnly on Amy Winehouse\u2019s\ndeath, discussing the media\u2019s\nportrayal of her heroin addiction,\nin comparison to the relapse into\nalcohol addiction that actually\nkilled her. Despite being sober for\nsix weeks, which the government\ndefines as being \u2018cured\u2019, it was a\nbottle of vodka combined with an\nabstinence-induced low tolerance\nthat killed her.\nDavid Nutt pressed the danger of\nalcohol, telling the audience that it\nwas now the leading cause of death\nin men in the UK today, and would\nsoon be the same for women.\nHowever, politically, alcohol is\naccepted and enjoyed by policymakers and journalists, which he\nsuggested was a motive behind the\ngovernment\u2019s preferential treatment\nof alcohol to other illegal drugs that\ndo less harm overall.\nObviously, as an advocate for\ndrug reform, David Nutt mourned\nthe seemingly non-research based\nrhetoric behind the government\u2019s\ncurrent drug laws.Not only do these\nlaws unfairly penalise people of\ncolour, they make his research into\nusing drugs like LSD, mushrooms\nand MDMA to treat a range of\npsychiatric disorders, all the harder\nto do. Getting research like this past\nethics committees, and therefore\nsecuring funding, sound like a\nnightmare.\nThis is what led to David Nutt to\ncollaborate with Channel 4 to make\nthe Drugs Live programmes, which\nas well as giving us the amazing\nfootage of Channel 4 newsreader\nJon Snow stoned in an MRI\nmachine, also gave Nutt and his\nco-researchers the funding to do a\nbrain imaging study on patients on\nMDMA.\nThe new psychoactive substances\nlaw that comes into effect at the\nend of this month did not escape a\nmention, although Professor Nutt\ndid not take a favourable stance\non the legal highs, such as spice,\nthat this new law is attempting to\nclamp down on. Spice is a synthetic\ncannabis that\u2019s now widespread\nin prisons. Originally created as a\nmedicine but deemed too toxic for\nuse, it\u2019s risen in popularity in the\nprison system since it is difficult\nto detect in both drug tests and by\nsmell. However, it is by no means\npreferable to cannabis use, as it\u2019s far\nmore potent and, more importantly\nfor public health, we know much\nless about it.\nDavid Nutt\u2019s pragmatism when\nit comes to drugs is obvious when\nhe speaks. He speaks on the\nsubject with all the authority and\nfrustration that you might expect\nfrom someone who\u2019s attempted to\nwork with the government when it\ncomes to drug policy. The evidence\nis obvious to him, and by the end of\nthe talk it seems obvious to you too:\nwanting drastic new drug policy is\nno longer the standpoint of stoners\nand lib dems \u2013 it may well be the\nbest way forward for public health\nin this country.\nThat amounts to \u00a3342 million\nover the last decade\n\n"

The gameplay element most\ncriticised in previous titles was the\nthird-person gunplay. Imperfect\ncontrols plagued these repetitive\nsections which make up a large part\nof the Uncharted series.Many would\nargue (myself included) that the\ngames would be better if shooting\nwere removed completely. A few\nyears after the release of Uncharted\n3, Naughty Dog released The Last\nof Us, which fixed many of these\nissues. Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End\nrelies heavily on the improvements\nthat made The Last of Us a critical\nsuccess. It\u2019s more serious in tone,\nrelies less on set-pieces, and feels\nmore natural (in all of its gameplay\nmechanics). This is easily the best\ngame Naughty Dog have ever made,\nthe best game on the PS4, and a\nhistoric moment in video game\nhistory. It is the first game that truly\nmoves beyond the uncanny valley\nare able to render interactive\nenvironments \u2013 in their own\nhome \u2013 in such detail. Uncharted\n4 transports us to bright green\njungles where each tree, branch,\nand leaf sways effortlessly in the\nwind. Drake and his companions\ntravel to ancient cities in decay and\nlively modern tourist destinations.\nTo emphasise the expansiveness of\nUncharted 4 and chill. Photo Credit: Naughty Dog\ninto astonishing realism.\nPhotorealism has been a goal since\nthe dawn of video games.In the past\nthe limits of technology resulted in\nartists making stylistic choices to\ncreate attractive games regardless,\nwhile some rejected (and continue\nto reject) photorealism altogether.\nIt is only now with the sheer power\nof modern consoles that consumers\nthe world that they have created,\nthe sea is nearly always in view.\nIt\u2019s rare for the player to ever feel\nenclosed (unless they\u2019re in a cave,\nobviously) or constrained. The\ngame might be linear, but it feels\nlike an \u2018open\u2019 world. Naughty Dog\nThese spectacular graphics are the\nresult of more than just detailed\ngeometry and textures; developers\nNaughty Dog showcase some of\nthe industry\u2019s best lighting effects.\nIt is this aspect of its graphics that\nmakes the game truly stand apart\nfrom its predecessors (and even the\nrecent Uncharted trilogy collection\nreleased on PS4). The game not\nonly takes place in many locations,\nbut in a variety of different lighting\nconditions. Some chapters play\nout completely at night (or day),\nwhile others take place entirely in\nunderground caverns. The light that\nbrings visibility to these areas \u2013\nwhether it be a lighter,torch or flame\n\u2013 also creates incredibly realistic\nshadows. A frequent sense of\nclaustrophobia is the result of these\ntechnologies; as much as Uncharted\nhas always been about exploring and\nbeing out in the open it has often\ncontrasted this with the fear of\nbeing trapped in ancient tombs and\nstructures. With much of the game\ntaking place near, or on, the water,\nNaughty Dog have ensured these\nbodies of liquid look gorgeous and\nreact to external forces in the way\nyou would expect. Frequent close-ups of Nathan Drake\u2019s glistening\nA game where you get to spend some quality time with the lads. Photo Credit: Naughty Dog\nforehead only affirm the excellence\nof the technology on display.\nThe other aspect of Uncharted 4\u2019s\npresentation that deserves praise\nis its animation. Playing as Drake\nyou feel like you inhabit a physical\nspace, as his body reacts to crowds\n(similar to the Assassin\u2019s Creed\nseries), action, and environmental\ndestruction. Even more impressive\nis the utilisation of facial capture\nto animate the faces of the games\nnot known for the quality of their\nscripts, and the supposed final game\nis not much of an exception. For a\ngame that glosses over unnecessary\ndeath, it is surprising that the script\nhas so many reflective moments.\nThese are mainly conversations\nbetween Nathan Drake and\nhis wife Elena, examining their\nrelationship and questioning the\nactions that cause the game\u2019s major\nconflicts. Naughty Dog also play\nwith narrative and structure with\none chapter in particular being a\ngreat (and surprising) example of\nunreliable narration. The subtitle\nof the game, \u201cA Thief\u2019s End\u201d, has\nIs this the real life or is this just fantasy? Photo Credit: Naughty Dog\nmultiple meanings. One of these\nrefers to the infamous pirate, Henry\nAvery, whose story is told over the\ncourse of many chapters. It is his\ntreasure (valued in the hundreds of\nmillions) that the Drake brothers\nchase after. To find it they travel\nto the secretive pirate colony of\nLibertalia. Throughout this journey\nthe environments that the brothers\nencounter tell stories themselves,\ndepicting the rise and downfall of\na once revered man. Their quest is\nnot helped by the obstruction of the\ntreasure hunter Rafe Adler who has\nhired the help of Nadine Ross and\nher private military firm (who serve\nas the game\u2019s main bullet fodder).\nThe motivations of these villains\nmight be barely explained but they\nare sinister nonetheless.\nThe problem with talking about\nthe gameplay of Uncharted is that\nit is always the least interesting\naspect of the experience. While the\ngunplay has been improved it\u2019s still\nthe most tiresome part of the game.\nTo Naughty Dog\u2019s credit the length\nof these shooting sections has been\nsubstantially reduced and they\nare now more equally distributed\nfeel like padding and when massive\ndistances have to be traversed\nplayers drive vehicles instead.\nAmong the features added to the\ngame, the most exciting addition\nis the new rope swinging mechanic\nwhich is used to cross vast distances\nand chasms. This is an extension of\nthe already fluid system of climbing\nand overcoming obstacles and\nadds thrill to exhilarating escape\nsequences and moments of disaster.\nIf Uncharted was not the videogame\nversion of Indiana Jones before, it\ncertainly is now.\nIt is not an exaggeration to\nproclaim Uncharted 4 as one of\nthe defining games of the action-adventure genre so far \u2013 it does so\nmuch right (although admittedly\nonly after years of experimentation\nand refinement). What it fails\nto do is fully explore the other\nmeaning of \u201cA Thief\u2019s End.\u201d This\nis obvious a reference to the end\nof the series and Nathan Drake as\na thief. Yet for all he has stolen he\nnever questions the the imperialist\nnature of his actions, or the actions\nof those he is chasing after (Henry\nAvery and the rest of his pirate\nsociety). We are free to plunder the\nenvironments of Uncharted \u2013 in\nfact, we are rewarded in doing so \u2013\nyet this is never questioned. Drake\ntakes these cultural artefacts and\nstores them in an attic where no one\nelse can experience them, an act of\nselfishness that Naughty Dog seem\nintent on ignoring.\nTime to mingle. Photo Credit: Naughty Dog\nThe game\nmight be\nlinear, but\nit feels like\nan \u2018open\u2019\nworld\ngo beyond what is necessary - they\ncreate stunning vistas and endless\nsprawling cities as mere backdrops\nto an already detailed foreground.\nTo experience everything the game\nhas to offer you must leave no area,\nhowever small, uncharted.\nNaughty\nDog\nshowcase\nsome of the\nindustry\u2019s\nbest\nlighting\neffects\ncast. Unlike games such as L.A.\nNoire (which was unable to escape\nthe uncanny valley), Uncharted\n4 blurs the line between digital\ncharacters and film.

As the great\ncultural icons Boris and Nigel might\nlike to believe, if it were not for the\nbloodsucking greed of the EU, each\nand every British family up and\ndown the country would be wading\nin the newfound riches of our\ngreat free trade state. Of course the\nnumbers are wrong, but that would\nmake for a less punchy tagline.\nIncluding Thatcher\u2019s renegotiation\nof the UK\u2019s EU contribution in\n1984, the British rebate drops the\nactual sum to around \u00a3250m. But\neven still, the whole idea of sending\naway billions to the EU misses the\nThe EU contribution to the Arts\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nWhy only a Remain vote on June 23rd\nwill benefit the future of British art\nMaybe so, maybe not, whatever\nthe truth, anyone claiming that the\nissue isn\u2019t disastrously complicated\nis probably lying. However, in one\narea the EU is surely nothing but a\nforce for good \u2013 amongst the many\nother EU spending receipts, there is\none stack devoted to supporting UK\narts and culture.\nWhile the Arts Council remains\nofficiallyneutral,theirstatisticsshow\nthat over the 2014-2015 spending\nperiod,175 UK cultural and creative\norganisations benefitted from \u20ac39\nmillion in Creative Europe funding\n\u2013 the UK being the second biggest\nbeneficiary after Germany. From\nprojects on the artistic impact of\nceramics to the world renowned\nHay Festival, EU funding for the\narts is diverse and differentiating.\nOn a wider stage, many recent\nhighlights in British cinema have\ncome with the assistance of EU\nfunding including the likes of The\nKing\u2019s Speech, Slumdog Millionaire\nand this year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or winner\nI, Daniel Blake. While many might\nmoan at thousands being spent on\nniche art projects, the preservation\npoint \u2013 the majority of that sum is\nsent back in all the different shapes\nand sizes of EU spending in the UK.\nDisgraceful I know, not only does\nActs for the 2016 LIFT Festival which is funded through Creative Europe.

Equally, while\nsome might argue that this degree\nof arts funding could be matched if\nwe left the EU, the past six years of\nreduced government spending on\nculture suggests that this is unlikely.\nBut the EU\u2019s contribution to UK\narts is more than just the Creative\nEurope funding. A number of\ncultural institutions have benefited\nfrom the work of the European\nRegional Development Fund and\nprogrammes including Erasmus\nand Interreg make substantial\ninvestments in British creative\ninstitutions.\nTo satisfy those most interested in\nthe economic argument, it is worth\nremembering that the EU\u2019s position\nas the UK\u2019s largest trading partner\nalso applies to the creative industries.\nFor every \u00a31 invested in the creative\nindustries, an additional \u00a32.01 is\n175 UK\ncultural\norganisations\nbenefitted\nfrom \u20ac39m\nin Creative\nEurope funding\nthe EU flood the UK with unwanted\nmigrants, they also have the cheek\nto think that they know best when\nit comes to spending in the Britain.\ngenerated in the wider economy.\nWith the arts contributing a total of\n\u00a37.7 billion to the UK economy in\n2011, the sector is thriving despite\nartistically. With reports showing\na \u00a3750 million boost to Liverpool\u2019s\neconomy and a 10% rise in visitation\nnumbers at museums and galleries,\nthe economic benefits of the UK\nseem clear. Unfortunately, with the\nUK being only one small part of the\nwider EU community, we need to\nwait until 2023 for the European\nCapital of Culture to return to the\nUK where Leeds and Dundee have\nbeen cited as hopefuls, but in the\nmeantime, it is worth remembering\nthat the EU project is as much\nabout cultural unity as it is about\neconomic prosperity.\nIncreasingly, the work of artists\nis becoming less bound by the\nBrexit\nhas been\ndescribed\nas a \u201chuge\ncreative step\nbackwards\u201d\nand \u201cartistic\nisolation\u201d\nrecent cuts. As is always the case,\nsome groups have complained\nabout EU regulation on the export\nof cultural goods. However, the\nfact that Europe\u2019s cultural heritage\ncannot be sold by Christies to the\nMiddle East and Asia is probably a\ngood thing.\nOne clear example of the EU\u2019s\nbenefit is through initiatives such\nas the European Capital of Culture.\nAlthough the UK has not been\nhost since 2008 when Liverpool\nwas awarded the title, this yearly\nevent has seen major benefits for\neach city both economically and\nMaybe it is\nthe role of\nart to remind\neveryone of\nthe importance\nof this cultural\nunion\ntraditional geographic borders and\ninternational collaboration has\nbecome the norm. From the point\nof view of the artists themselves\nthe prospect of Brexit has been\ndescribed as a \u201chuge creative step\nbackwards\u201d and \u201cartistic isolation.\u201d\nOnly last week, 282 of the leading\nIndustries Federation being recently\npolled, a huge 96% responded as\nbeing in favour of remaining in the\nEU. With over 2.6 million people\nemployed in the creative economy,\nit would be na\u00efve to think that\nleaving the EU would not harm\nour creative output. Of course, as\nthe Mail Online said so eloquently,\nthe creative industries are filled with\n\u201cdesperate left-wing luvvies,\u201d so it\nis no wonder that there is strong\nsupport for the EU, but that should\nnot negate the powerful voice of this\ninfluential community.\nIn the end, I anticipate that the\narts will be a quiet bystander in\nthe final arguments for staying or\nleaving the EU. With much of the\nLeave campaign\u2019s argument focused\naround anti-immigration bigotry,\nyou could easily vote for staying\nin the EU on purely moral reasons\nwithout worrying about the arts.\nHowever, in this time of European\ndivision and the rise of radical\nanti-EU parties on the continent,\nmaybe it is the role of art to remind\neveryone of the importance of\nthis cultural union. The EU is far\nfrom perfect, and there are many\nlegitimate reasons one might want\nto leave, but doing so without long\nterm harm across different sectors\nand especially in the arts is not\ngoing to happen.\nICU is holding an EU debate on the\n2nd\nof June in Skempton 164\nMembers of\nthe Creative\nIndustries\nFederation ....\nrecently polled,\n[with] 96%\nbeing in favour\nof remaining in\nthe EU\ncreatives in the UK signed an open\nletter urging support for remaining\nin the EU. With the likes of Poet\nLaureate Carol Ann Duffy, actors\nBill Nighy, Benedict Cumberbatch\nand Keira Knightly, and industry\nexecutives from leading production\ncompanies and publishers, creative\nsupport for the EU is overwhelming.\nWhile the financial benefit for\ncreatives at the top is clear, many\nsmaller, less influential artists show\nequally strong support for the EU.\nWith members of the Creative\nPalme d\u2019Or winner Ken Loach whose film I, Daniel Blake was funded through Creative Europe.

Photo Credit: ABC\nA\ns the renewal period\nfor shows finally winds\ndown and writers once\nmore begin plotting\nahead, networks start to announce\nwhich shows didn\u2019t make the\ncut. The major victims for this\nseason are the singing competition\npowerhouse American Idol, the\ncountry-music drama Nashville,\nand a personal favourite of mine,\nthe Nathan Fillion driven, crime\nprocedural Castle. But, as much as\nwe mourn the recently departed, the\nreasons why individual shows are\ncancelled are quite varied.\nThe most common reason for\na cancelled show will be a lack\nof viewer interest. It simply isn\u2019t\ndrawing in the numbers, and more\nimportantly the advertising money,\nthat the network wants, and so off\nwith its head.This is especially true if\nthe lack of advertising money means\nthat the show is turning a loss for\nthem. After all, my future bankers,\nwhy do anything if it doesn\u2019t earn\nyou a good chunk of money?\nShows can also be cancelled due\nto infighting about any number of\nthings, from the creative direction\nof the show to conflicts between\nsome of the people involved. The\nmanagement might also decide to\naxe the show in order to make room\nfor a hopefully better and more\nprofitable one.\nCare in point, Star Trek was cacelled\nafter three seasons. However, due\nto massive fan support the show\neventually returned to TV as Star\nTrek: The Next Generation, and the\nfranchise is alive today with the new\nseries of rebooted films.\nSo, as much as we might get\nangry at a network for cancelling\nour favourite show, try and think\npositively. For every great show\nthat stops being produced another\ntakes its place, and if that sucks,\nwho knows, we might get a reboot.\nUnless that sucks as well.\nDaisies, the fantastically absurd\nstory of a pie-maker with the ability\nto resurrect the dead, and Firefly,\na \u2018space western\u2019 by Joss Whedon\nwith one of the largest and vocal\ncult followings. Weirdly enough,\nbeing cancelled often doesn\u2019t mean\nthat content stops being made for\nthe show. It\u2019s generally the case\nthat when a show with a large fan\nbase is cancelled, the staff behind\nit will be bombarded with requests\nfor a renewal or for more content\nin that universe. Occasionally these\nfans get exactly what they wanted.\nAnurag Deshpande\nWriter\nNow the tables have turned. Photo Credit: HBO\nIn war, even\nthe \u2018good\nguys\u2019 can\u2019t\nstay good\nfor very\nlong\nMore satisfyingly though, some\nshows are simply cancelled once\nthey\u2019ve run their course.The writers\nand director have told the story that\nthey wanted to tell, and so rather\nthan letting it go stale they just cease\nwork on it. While some executives\nare of the \u2018bleed it dry\u2019 philosophy,\nand will never cancel a show if it\u2019s\nstill bringing in the green, that rare\nbreed of management who actually\nbelieve in giving shows a satisfactory\nending crops up often enough that\nthe TV format is still going (fairly)\nstrong.\nSome of the more famous\ncasualties of recent times include\ngems like Arrested Development,\nan award-winning sitcom about a\nfamily of narcissistic idiots, Pushing\nWhy do\nanything if it\ndoesn\u2019t earn\nyou a good\nchunk of\nmoney?\nI\nt\u2019s a fairly eventful week in\nthe most recent, unfortunately\nweaker, episode of Game of\nThrones.Right off the bat,we\u2019re\ntreated to perhaps one of the biggest\nreveals in the series; the origin of\nthe White Walkers. The problems\nstart here, because this scene sorely\nlacks the gravitas it requires and as a\nresult has nowhere near the impact\nthat it should. The fact that it just\nsort of happens, out of nowhere,\ndoesn\u2019t help.\nPerhaps if it was done a bit later in\nthe series, with more time dedicated\nto it and more questions answered\nit would\u2019ve felt weightier. In its\ndefence, however, there were a few\ninteresting things to be noticed in\nthis scene. In particular, one of the\nWeirwoods having a serious case\nof Max Von Sydnow face and the\nfact that it is spring this far north.\nIn retrospect, this also raises some\nfurther interesting questions about\nthe nature of the Walkers,but,at the\ntime, I was underwhelmed.\nFunnily enough, my favourite\nmoments of the episode were the\nrelatively low-key ones. Jorah and\nDany\u2019s reunion and prompt re-separation was fantastic. This was\nnarratively a great place for Jorah\u2019s\narc to go and, honestly, I wouldn\u2019t\nmind too much even if this was its\nend. But, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite\ndone with him just yet (crazy theory\ntime: Jorah will end up meeting\nArya/the Faceless Men given their\nand Greyscale\u2019s mutual links to the\nDoom of Valyria).\nAll things considered, it was nice\nto see the Andal finally admit his\nfeelings out loud, and accept his\nfate. Equally, it felt well-earned\nto have Dany finally acknowledge\nhow much she values his friendship\nand would be impacted by his loss.\nThe scene had beautiful pangs\nof finality and regret, thanks in\nno small part to Emilia Clarke\u2019s\nexcellent performance. It further\nserves to make her realise the folly\nof arrogant tendencies; having\npotentially driven one of her closest\nfriends to his death. Dany, for better\nor worse, takes the world for what\nshe wants it to be rather than what\nit is; reflected in her desperate order\nto Jorah to find a cure for himself,\ninstead of a heartfelt goodbye.\nFinally, there is the great tragedy\nof Hodor; his life ruined just so\nthat he could die alone in the cold,\nscreaming, and so far from home.\nThe death itself was unusually\npoetic and heroic for the series.\nThough, to me, the origin of the\nname felt incredibly cheesy. Poor\nWillis\u2019fate at the hands of Bran ties\nback into the Children\u2019s creation of\nthe Walkers; a grim reminder that\nin war,even the \u2018good guys\u2019can\u2019t stay\ngood for very long.

But what most on the\nleft don\u2019t think about is the strong\nleft wing argument for leaving the\nEU.\nThe EU is the antithesis of left-wing politics and economics.\nSpawned from the first emergence\nof neoliberal politics of the 1970s\nand 80s and coinciding with\nThatcherism in the UK, it is these\npolitics that still dominate EU\npolicy to this day, and act to mean\nthat it supports big business over\nthe real interests of the people of its\nmember states. A topical example\nof this is the crisis of the UK steel\nindustry. While the EU does not\nexplicitly ban the nationalism of an\nindustry, it heavily implies that it is\nnot allowed, with governments not\nallowed to invest in ventures that\nwould reduce competition in the\nmarket and reduce the profits of\nother businesses (even if it means\nsaving 40,000 jobs). This also poses\na problem to renationalising the\nrailways, an issue that has regained\na lot of support lately. Would state\nownership and operation of rail\nservices reduce competition in the\ntransport sector? Of course \u2013 but\nhopefully to the benefit of those\nthat use it. And of course, we cannot\nforget the ruthless imposition of\nausterity policies on the Greek\neconomy.\nWhen Obama told me I\u2019d be\nback of the line for neoliberal\ntrade agreements like TTIP (the\nTransatlantic Trade and Investment\nPartnership, which is admittedly\ncoming under fire in many countries\nbut still being pushed for),I thought\n\u201cgreat, so be it\u201d. While these are just\na few anecdotal examples, and of\ncourse I\u2019m not inferring that leaving\nthe EU would solve all of our\neconomic problems, I\u2019ll be voting to\nleave as I oppose the nature of the\nEU\u2019s ideologies.\nAn argument I often hear on the\nleftisthatleavingtheEUwilltrigger,\nor facilitate, a rise in xenophobic,\nclosed-borders nationalism. While I\ndo agree that this is a danger (there is\na big difference between patriotism\nand unhealthy nationalism), the rise\nof the right and far-right across\nEurope scares me just as much.\nJust this week, Austria narrowly\navoided a far-right president, with a\nvictory for the centre-left of 50.3%\nto 49.7%. In Hungary, Denmark,\nand even Sweden, the rise of the\nright is reflective of the whole of\nThe EU is not perfect, but the better option\nLeaving the EU will detriment the\nUK, Europe, and the world\nPietro Aronica\nWriter\nI\nhave written many times for\nFELIX with trollish tones and\nhyperbole, but this time, there\nis no exaggeration in what I\nsay: I can think of no worse political\ncatastrophe in our time than the\nUK leaving the European Union,\nperhaps only rivalled by a Trump\npresidency.\nThe upcoming referendum is of\nenormous importance, and many\nof you won\u2019t be called to vote again\non anything that approaches the\nsame relevance. I hope that you\nmake the right decision, which is to\nremain. Don\u2019t think that it\u2019s because\nI am a grubby foreigner; I believe\nin the European project, which\nan 'out' vote would end. I want\nto address some of the concerns\nabout membership of the EU, and\nhopefully show you that, despite\nthese, a reaction of isolation is not\nthe correct answer.\nFirst there is the issue of\nimmigration, which appears to be\nthe primary concern of Brexiteers.\nEssentially, an independent UK\ncould stop unwanted refugees,\njobseekers and other undesirables\nentering the country. I could\nconflate this to racism, but it\u2019s a\nserious concern: is immigration\nharmful? Won\u2019t immigrants make it\nharder for locals to find jobs?\nSimply put, no. By and large,\nimmigration is beneficial for the\nreceiving country, mostly as a\nsource of cheaper labour. Will there\nbe cases of foreigners straight up\ntaking a job that could have gone\nto a Briton? Yes, it will happen, but\nwe should not formulate policies\nbased on anecdotal evidence. These\nevents, while relevant for the\nindividual, do not represent what\nhappens on a macroeconomic level.\nAs immigrants arrive, the size of the\neconomy increases and everyone\nbenefits, even those initially\nshort-changed. To take a familiar\nexample, if an immigrant takes a\nPhD scholarship at the expense\nof an English researcher, it might\nbe bad for the latter, but foreign\ntalent and interest will create more\npositions down the line, benefiting\nfuture research. UK universities will\nalso profit more in publications and\ncontributions than if immigrants\nhad worked elsewhere.\nIf we claim to be a meritocratic\nsociety, then we should evaluate\npeople on their capabilities rather\nthan their origin. A nationality\nis not a merit, nor a fault. To\ndiscriminate between workers based\non this metric risks being shortsighted and self-limiting. Besides,\nmost new immigrants don\u2019t come\nfrom the EU, and Brexit wouldn\u2019t\nimpact the ability to regulate it. On\nthe other hand,most companies and\neconomic studies agree that an open\nimmigration policy with regards to\nthe EU is beneficial for all.\nThe other big issue is the\nbureaucracy of the EU, considered\nby many as poorly democratic and\nnot transparent. But, for all its\nfaults, the EU is the most successful\nsupranational organisation of our\nage: it has ensured collaboration\nand peace between countries that\nless than a century ago were fighting\neach other. Some regulations will be\nmore beneficial for certain members,\nand some will be confusing to the\nlayman,but is that any different from\nany state? Some UK policies are\nbetter for England than Scotland;\nsome benefit London over the rest.\nGoverning is a complicated process\nwhich must balance millions of\nconflicting interests. If the UK were\nto leave to regulate itself better, why\nstop there? Why can\u2019t every county,\nevery town, every house become its\nown state to regulate itself better? A\nfractalisation of government would\ndivide for the sake of ephemeral\nself-determination and would create\ncomplexity.\nThe EU has flaws, but in order\nto correct them we must remain\ninside. To leave at this point would\nmean to have no say in matters that\nend up affecting us all. No country\nis truly an island: now more than\never, global events have far-reaching\nconsequences, and it is better to\nhave coordinated responses and\npolicies rather than many parties\neach trying to safeguard their own\ninterests.The alternative is to return\nto 28 different countries, with 28\ndifferent standards, 28 different sets\nof laws, 28 currencies, 28 divided\nEurope. And personally, that doesn\u2019t\nentice me. An interesting parallel is\nthe argument for devolution (the\nhanding of more powers to local\nauthorities) in this country. Many\npeople who support giving more\npower to Cornwall or Manchester\nbecause they can\u2019t be governed in\nthe same way as the London or the\nSouth East don\u2019t support leaving\nthe EU.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though, I do\nthink that the EU has some great\npolicies and initiatives, and I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s some malicious machine\nout to get us all. Of course, being\nSTEM students, we can\u2019t overlook\nthe benefits that Europe brings\nus in terms of scientific funding\nor collaboration. Freedom of\nThe referendum is not just a left-right debate. Photo Credit: BBC\nWe're stuck choosing the lesser of two evils. Photo Credit: The Sun\nThe EU has\nflaws, but\nin order\nto correct\nthem we\nmust remain\nAn isolated\nUK would\nfind it\nimpossible\nto reestablish\nitself\npeoples.\nThis is what would occur if\nthe UK left: it would end the\nEuropean project. We would\nreturn to a fractured continent,\nweaker in international matters.\nThe Brexiteer's dream is that an\nindependent UK would prosper\nonce freed from the shackles of\nimmigration and bureaucracy, but\nthat\u2019s nothing short of utopic. The\nUK is small and unremarkable: it\nhas thrived so far not despite, but\ndue to being a part of Europe,taking\nadvantage of shared bargaining\nand supranational regulations. The\n19th\ncentury is gone, and the days\nof Empire are over. The world has\nmuch changed and, according to\nmost professionals, an isolated UK\nwould find it impossible to reestablish itself on its own today.\nI won\u2019t comment further on\neconomic aspects, because every\nauthority and expert says the UK\nwill be better off staying in, nor will\nI dwell on the rhetoric of those who\nadvocate 'out'. Misunderstanding\nimmigration can lead to poor\npolicies, and the EU, despite its\nbureaucracy, still represents the best\nway forward for the UK.\nThis has been an unusually\nrestrained article for me. I set off\nto write something more sarcastic,\nbut I don\u2019t intend to insult anyone.\nIf you\u2019re doubtful, you\u2019re right to be.\nIt\u2019s a complex issue whose outcome\nwill affect us for generations. I hope\nthat what I\u2019ve said will answer your\nconcerns and perhaps nudge you\ntowards what, I feel, is the best\nanswer.\nFor a better UK, a better Europe,\na better world, the UK should stay.\nThe EU\nis the\nantithesis\nof left-wing\npolitics\nThe rise of\nthe right\nand far-right across\nEurope\nscares me\nmovement is fantastic when going\nthrough customs. And there are a\nmyriad of reasons, easily accessible\nelsewhere, for staying in the EU\nthat I completely agree with. But I\ndon\u2019t agree with Greek economist\nYannis Varoufakis (though he is\nprobably much more qualified than\nme) when he says we should vote\nto remain so that we can negotiate\nand change the very nature of the\nEU from within. Being only one\nof 28 member states, and given the\namount of red tape and (primarily\nGermany\u2019s) resistance to change, I\njust don\u2019t see that as being possible.\nIf we could scrap the EU and start\nagain from scratch, a completely\nnew union, I would wholeheartedly\nsupport this.\nI know I\u2019ve omitted a lot of\nkey points like workers\u2019 rights,\nthe human rights act and trade\nagreements, but the EU debate has\nso many things to consider, and can\nsplit those on the right or on the left.\nOn the left we should take a step\nback, and look at the real left issues,\nand not be (too) snobby about our\nBrexit counterparts.\nAll in all, my main issue with this\nis the nature of the referendum.\nDo I want to stay in the EU, or be\ngoverned by pure, unadulterated\nCameron and Osborne? Neither,\nreally.\n\n"

What is even more\nsurprising is the complete silence\nand astonishment of the \u201cBeit\nSabbatical Establishment\u201d.\n1050 signatures should at least\nwarrant a response and a promise\nfrom the Union president to deliver\non a student petition. The 2016\nLeadership election saw a very\nfamiliar theme with what we\u2019ve seen\n'Social justice warriors' would do well to listen to their own sermon of tolerance\nArnold Tan\nWriter\nT\nhere has been a recent rise\nof an online stronghold\nof cultural libertarianism,\nwhich has been deemed\nby some to be a reactionary\nmovement against the regressive left.\nClassically liberal and conservative\nfigures are breaking down the\nbarriers between the political left\nand right, and are coming together\nto discuss a multitude of ideas\nincluding free speech, political\ncorrectness, censorship and 'safe\nspaces' in the university scene, and\ncultural relativity.\nHere is my #MessageToFeminists\nProminent figureheads in the\ndiscussion include talk show\nhost Dave Rubin, equity feminist\nChristina Hoff Sommers,\nlibertarian activist Lauren Southern\nand controversial gay conservative\nMilo Yiannopoulos.\nIt was only a matter of time\nuntil something so contentious as\na #MessageToFeminists campaign\nwould arise. The hashtag, created by\none Taleed Brown on his Youtube\nchannel That Guy T, aimed to\nstimulate debate on the current\nfeminist movement by giving a\nvoice to its most common critiques.\nOriginally devised as a Youtube\nchallenge, the hashtag is now\nmaking rounds on Twitter, drawing\nattention to the need for an actual\nintellectual conversation and free\nexchange of ideas, which many\nbelieve has failed to take place in a\nmonotonic, stifling PC culture.\nBrown himself had this message\nto impart: \u201cThe rejection of\nindividualist freedom for the pursuit\nof authoritarian equality is not\nempowerment.\u201d\nIndeed, more and more\n\u2018systematically-oppressed classes\u2019\nare speaking out against the\nneoprogressive doctrines that\nmodern feminism promulgates.This\nis certainly not tantamount to the\nopposition of classical liberalism:\noften the opposite, actually. I,\nmyself, believe a part of classical\nliberalism is updating, reforming\nand exchanging our opinions and\nbeliefs where necessary (Bayesian\ninference, anyone?) to preserve\nintellectual integrity.\nSo, here is my\n#MessageToFeminists (specifically,\nthird-wavers): why not embrace\nthe criticism and use it to benefit\nand reform the movement? Why is\nunfavourable dissent being shut out\nandshutdown?Aremodernfeminist\nidealogies too flimsy to withstand\nscrutiny? Why is the movement so\nintolerant of its questioners, despite\nclaims of diversity and acceptance?\nKarl Popper\u2019s paradox of tolerance\ncomes to mind.\nEveryone knows the dictionary\ndefinition of feminism. It has been\nrepeated ad nauseam to the public\nthrough progressive media outlets\nand popular celebrities. The reason,\nthen, must run deeper as to why so\nmany refuse to associate themselves\nwith the movement. If everything\nboiled down to a dictionary\ndefinition, we'd have many more\npeople comfortably identifying as\nfeminists. The trouble is that third\nwave feminism, the poster child of\nthe regressive left and PC culture, is\nnot reflecting that definition.\nAlso relevant is the unspoken\nobligation to subscribe by default to\ncertain feminist theories other than\nthe otherwise harmless dictionary\ndefinition. Privilege theory, as\npreached by third wave feminism,\nas practised today, is demonstrably\nflawed. So is intersectional theory,\nwhich divides the classes rather\nthan unifying them. I concede\nthat these theories were conceived\nwith good intentions, and that\ncertain aspects of these theories\ndo hold water. However, one need\nmerely consider the recent incident\ninvolving Oxford student activist\nNtokozo Qwabe to get a sense of\nhow far these progressive idealogies\nare being taken by their proponents,\nand how they are being used to\njustify actual discrimination. What\nis remarkable is not that Qwabe\nand a fellow social activist publicly\nA conservative, a feminist and a comedian walk into a bar \u2013 and talk about political correctness. Photo Credit: Youtube\nharassed a white waitress on the\nbasis of her ethnicity (reducing her\nto what Qwabe gleefully refers to\nas \u2018white tears\u2019). What is scary is\nthat Qwabe justified his actions by\nexplaining how ethnic minorities\ncannot be racist due to the\nsystematic oppression and invisible\nstructures of society working against\nmarginalized classes.\nThis concerns me gravely. We\nare cultivating a generation of\nmillennials who bully and actually\nmarginalize individuals of another\nbackground while operating under\nthe guise of social justice!\nReal life is not a novel where\nthe Draco Malfoys are so easily\nidentified. In the current day we\nhave bullies of a different variety,\nthe \u2018social justice warriors\u2019 who\ngenuinely believe they are fighting\non the right side of things. This\nis more dangerous than a generic\nschoolyard bully, who at least\noperates clearly on the outside of\na communal moral code (everyone\nknows that harassing another kid\nfor lunch money is wrong) and can't\njustify his or her actions by claiming\na \u2018moral enlightenment\u2019.\nMany feminists are convinced\nof the superiority of their idealogy\nin society. Look no further than\nMark Ruffalo\u2019s Tumblr post telling\nwomen against feminism to \u201ckiss\nmy ass\u201d. How will this possibly get\nmore people to join his feminist\ncause? To put this in perspective,\nimagine if this was the method\nused to draw awareness to any other\nactivist movement campaigning for\nenvironmental concerns, animal\nrights, or even a religion. Wouldn\u2019t\nmass disapproval ensue?\nThusly,many feminists run the risk\nof becoming intractable and unable\nto adapt to opposing viewpoints.\nAfter all, what other viewpoint is\nthere to adopt, outside of our own\nsuperior construction?\nI hope we all agree that feminism\nneeds to be more than running\naround harassing others in the\nname of creating a \u2018liberal, tolerant,\ndiverse culture\u2019. To me, this is not\nprogression! It is regression.\nAre modern\nfeminist\nidealogies\ntoo flimsy to\nwithstand\nscrutiny?\nFeminists\nrun the\nrisk of\nbecoming\nintractable\nglobally \u2013 a discontentment with\npower \u2013 with the underachieving\n\u201cBeit Quad Cartel\u201d and \u201cCV\npatching sabbaticals\u201d. Imperial\u2019s\nsabbaticals are elected in the largest\ndemocratic university elections in\nEngland, with a clear mandate to\nraise the issues that we care about\nas students, but failing to do so is a\nfailure at their jobs.\nThe environment in which we\nspend months of summer term\ntrying to untangle our degrees must\nbe a priority. We not only deserve\nair conditioning, but demand it;\nour tuition fees justify it. I strongly\nbelieve the new union president\nNas should make it a priority to\nnegotiate with college to deliver\nthis. Some funds and licenses are\nalready in place. Nothing justifies\nthe ridiculous state of a five floor\nincinerator with a nauseating smell.\nAs a member of the union council\nI can tell you that many things are\nwrong in this union, like that the\ncouncil doesn\u2019t meet and sabbaticals\nare only accountable to themselves.\nDid the union deliver significant\nchange to each and every one of\nus this year besides \u00a32.60 pints,\nsports nights and a fiasco Summer\nBall headliner? The union's role is\nThe EU is good for Europe\nBut pretty bad for the rest of the world\nSebastian Gonzato\nWriter\nto \u201cenhance student\u2019s experience at\nImperial.\u201d Well the people demand\nair conditioning and you better\ndeliver, or your office is not only\nundermined, but void of sense and\npurpose.\nActual scenes from level 4 in summer term. Photo Credit: pando.com\nL\net me start by saying that,\ngenerally, I am pro EU.\nBefore university,I went to\na European school, where\nI was taught extensively about the\nEuropean Union in my history and\ngeography classes. I\u2019m not blind to\nthe faults of the EU, namely that\nit is a prohibitively beaurocratic\ninstitution run by technocrats and\nMEPs elected by only 42.5% of the\nvoting public. Nonetheless, I would\nargue that on the whole, the EU is\nbeneficial to Europeans.\nHowever, the EU has not been a\ngood thing for the rest of the world.\nIn particular, the EU's policies on\nimmigration and agriculture have\nparticularly detrimental effects on\nthe developing world. The term\n\u2018Fortress Europe\u2019 was originally\ncoined in the Second World War\nto describe the areas of continental\nEurope occupied by Nazi Germany,\nbut it is an equally apt description of\nEurope\u2019s policies today.\nThe cornerstone of EU farming\npolicy is the Common Agricultural\nPolicy (CAP), which subsidises\nfarming within the EU, accounting\nfor nearly 40% of the EU\u2019s budget.\nAlong with tariffs on food coming\nfrom outside of the EU, the CAP\nhas allowed EU countries to become\nlargely self-sufficient on food post-war.This protectionism (common to\nmost developed countries) not only\nmakes some foods more expensive\nfor Europeans,it also harms farmers\nin developing countries who not\nonly can\u2019t afford to export their\nfood, but also have to deal with\nartificially cheap products coming\nfrom the EU.\nThen there\u2019s immigration: over\nthe past year we\u2019ve been told that\nthere\u2019s a refugee crisis in Europe.\nThere isn\u2019t, at least not in Europe.\nLebanon and Jordan have opened\ntheir borders to 2.5 million refugees\nin the past four years, representing a\n20% increase in the total population\nof these two countries. Compare\nthis to the 200,000 refugees that\nthe EU is now trying to deport to\nTurkey which represent an increase\nof 0.04% in the EU\u2019s population.\nJordan and Lebanon are reaching\na tipping point which could easily\nbe avoided if the EU opened its\nborders and shared the burden of\nthis humanitarian crisis.\nWhat makes this all particularly\ngalling is that, through the WTO\nand other organisations, the EU\npromotes neo-liberal policies like\nfree trade and migration while\ndoing exactly the opposite at home.\nThese policies are often imposed\non developing countries through\nIMF and World Bank loans, but it\nhappens at home as well; in 2012\nEU loans to Greece were granted\non the condition that Greece open\nup its energy sector.\nThe debate over Brexit has\nrevolved around, \"Would this make\nme better off?\". While I would like\nto think that the whole point of the\nEU is that it turns the \u2018me\u2019 into an\n\u2018us\u2019, the truth is the EU is just as\nself-interested as any other nation.\nThe EU\nhas a\ndetrimental\neffect\non the\ndeveloping\nworld\n\n"
