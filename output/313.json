As you may have heard at\nthe Union General Meeting on Tuesday, the\nmotions had to be in for it by 5 p.m. last Friday week, and the intrepid IC courier made\nNUS headquarters with one and a half\nminutes to spare.\nUnfortunately, the date\nfor having the motions in\nmeant that they could not\nbe discussed at a Union\nMeeting. However, as Rob\nArmitage, External Affairs Officer, explained at\nTuesday's meeting, the\namendments stage means\nthat we can amend our\nown motion even ito the\nextent of a \"delete all and\ninsert\" amendment. All that is essential is that the\nmotion retains the same\ntitle, and is on the same\nsubject.\nThe Union received\ncopies of all the motions\nsubmitted by all the\nunions affiliated to the\nNUS on Friday, and\namendments to these motions have to be in by\nFriday, 20th October.\nBecause of the timing of\nUnion Meetings, which\nare worked out months\nin advance, the External\nAffairs Committee will\ndiscuss all the motions\nand put forward their\nideas about amendments\nto the Union meeting on\nthe 19th October, where\nthey will be discussed.\nThere will be a joint\nmeeting of the NUS delegation and the External\nAffairs committee early\nthis week (see Stop Press\nNews on page 8) to discuss IC's action.\nJust to give you an idea\nof what happens after\nthen, read on. The NUS\npublishes the list of\namendments on the 27th October. Then the member Unions \"prior it is e\" motions \u2014 that is, they\nlist those motions that\nthey particularly want\ndiscussed at the conference . . . needless to say,\nConference cannot discuss\nall the hundreds of motions that are submitted!\nThis prior it is ation has to\nbe completed by the 10th November, and about\nthree days before Conference the agenda is pub-li shed. But enough of\nthat when the time comes\n\u2014 FELIX will have two\nreporters at the conference and will keep you\nwell informed of what is\ngoing on.\nAnd now, as promised,\nhere are the motions that\nIC has submitted in full.\nAlthough entitled to submit six, we have only put\nin three. They are as follows:\u2014\nTHE MOTIONS\n1. National Health Service and Private Practice\n\"Conference recognises that the creation of the\nNational Health Service was an important reform of\ngreat benefit to all, particularly working people, and\nbelieves that the continuation of private practice is\ndetrimental to the N.H.S. \"Conference see that the planned reform by H.M. Government will weaken the service and encourage\nprivate practice, thus discriminating against a great part\nof the population.\n\"Conference therefore:\n1. Opposes totally the current plans for re-organisation\nof the N.H.S.2. Is totally opposed to any cut-back in health expenditure\n3. Opposes private practice\n4. Instructs Endsleigh Insurance not to handle private\nhealth insurance policies.\n5. Calls for the disclosure of all corporate private\ninsurance policies\".\n2. Czechoslovakia\n\"Conference notes the increasingly repressive regime\nin Czechoslovakia since the Soviet 'Operation' of 1968,\nspecifically:\n1. 200 books were banned recently and 900 more are\nexpected to 'disappear'; job persecution is rife and\npolitical trials are escalating.\n2. 46 people are now on trial for various forms of\n'subversion' and 'hostility to the socialist social and\nstate system'. The overwhelming majority of these\ndefended themselves on the basis that they are\nsocialists and communists. These political prisoners\ninclude:\u2014\n(i) Jiri Muller, the acknowledged leader of the student movement during the Prague spring, who defended himself by making a heavy political attack on the\nbureaucracy. His main witness, Professor Sabata,\nstated that 'we are communists in opposition: you\n\u2014 i.e. the judge, etc., \u2014 are not communists'.\n(ii) Dr. Jan Tesar, a Marxist historian, who in his\ndefence told the prosecution that 'your children too\nwill judge you'.\n(iii) Dr. Milian Hubl \u2014 elected to the Presidium of\nthe Czech CP in August 1968.\nMuller received a year sentence, Sabata b\\ years,\nTesar 6 years and Dr. Hubl 6|- years.\nInstructions\n\"Conference deplores these reactionary political\ntrials and calls on all C.O.'s to support the activities of\nthe Committee for Defence of Czech Socialists \u2014 a broad committee of Czech socialist exiles and various\nBritish socialists.\nConference instructs:\nNUS EXECUTIVE to affiliate to the Czech Committee for Defence of Czech Socialists (c/o32 Belitha\nVillas, Nl)\nNUS EXECUTIVE to raise the matter with the International Union of Students and exert all possible\npressure on them to organise a world campaign\nagainst them, and denounce the trials\".\n3. Criminal Law Revision\n\"Conference notes the findings of the Criminal Law\nRevision Committee.\n\"Conference also notes the composition of this com-mitte e, and the fact that the majority of people consulted by the committee were chief constables.\n''Conference deplores:\n1. The use of the argument of increasing crime rate to\njustify curtailing defendants' rights. The principles\nof justice are independent of the number of crimes\ncommitted.\n2. The proposed changes or discarding of Judges' rules\nand hence the right to call a solicitor when taken to\na police station.\n3. The proposed changes to the 'right of silence' which\nwill mean that refusal to answer may be taken as an\nadmission of guilt\".\nYes, folks, at long last, only a week into\nterm, and the Union Building is still un-finished. The reason? A \"labour dispute\" that\naffected the supply of materials and delayed\noperations in some sections by up to eleven\nweeks. However, shouldn't be long now . . .\nMajor hold-ups are in\nthe Lower Lounge with\nthe building of the New\nLounge Bar (estimated\ncompletion in a fortnight)\nand the Room at the Top\n(RATT) where the delay\nis unknown owing to the\nsupply of fittings. Once\nthe RATT is finished\nthough, information and\nservices should improve\nconsiderably. Prospective\ntenants of RATT will include Accommodation,\nWelfare, Insurance, Travel, Bonnie Hartnett (the\nStudent Counsellor), I.C. Ents, various leaflets and\nbump h, one coffee mach-ine, some chairs and mag-a zines. So the RATT\ncould be used as a mini\nlounge too. Congestion in\nthe Union Office will be\ngreatly reduced, though\nby no means will it become less friendly!\nRATT can only be regarded as an experiment\nat the moment and its\nfull effects are not likely\nto be seen until it experiences a full year's opera-tion, next year. This year\nwill have seen RATT develop from the drawing\nboard to operation and\nthe next few months will\nbe useful to iron out any\ninitial hang-ups. So don't expect too much too\nsoon.\nYou may or may not\nhave noticed the change\nof surroundings in Mooney's Union Lower Eating\nHouse. The mini spotlights are audio modulated for use in Discos, etc.\nAt the moment I am investigating the existence\nof a suitable piece of\nmusic that could enhance\nthe colour of Mooney\nchips.\nFurther plans for the\nLower Refectory include\nremoval of those much-loved wooden chairs and\ntables and replace men jt( hopefully the same day)\nby more modern furniture to fit in with (he new\ndecor.\nLong term plans are\nalso in the line regarding\nthe Lower Lounge (if the\nbar takes much longer,\nthen that may be long\nterm too). The financial\nimplications of alcove\nseating around the windows in both the lounge\nand the lower refectory\nis being investigated . , .\nI 'll keep you informed!\nThat should complete\nphases 1 and 2 of the\nlower level master plan.\nAny plans for re-decor at ing and furnishing of the\nUnion now have to be\nlong term, otherwise nothing worthwhile ever gets\ndone and what is done is\nfutile (e.g. three coats of\narbitrary paint with the\nidea of further developments as happened a year\nago).\nSo bear with us friends.\nThings ARE happening.\nMust get back to the\npainting . . . .\nPaul Jowitt\n(Deputy President),\nLOST It's not unusual for people to lose things in college,\nnor is it unusual for someone to find something somebody else has lost. Apparently in the past there's been\na lot of confusion over what to do if you have lost/\nfound something, and Mr. Dawson. College Security\nOfficer, is understandably keen to have a set system\nfor this year.\nSo would you please address all your enquiries to Mr.\nDawson in Room 164 College Block. If you find some-thing, please hand it to any security guard, who will\npass it on to Mr. Dawson.\n\n"

Already it has acknowledged the growing interest in safes\nby displaying welcome signs to the drivers of those\ncumbersome vehicles: \"FOLKESTONE WELCOMES\nSAFE DRIVERS.\"\nI spoke to one enthusiastic owner of a steel-grey\ncombination model: \"Yes, Eve had this Chubbs for a good three weeks now. It's very reliable and so quiet.\n\"Of course, the wife didn't like it at first\u2014'What will\nthe neighbours say?' she said \u2014 but once she'd been\ninside it a few times she soon came around to my way\nof thinking.\n\"You have to be careful enough \u2014 I 've heard of some\nhooligans who go around blowing up safes. Can't understand it myself . . . \"\nNow to the practical side. Where can you buy a safe?\n1 went to see a South London dealer who prefers to remain anonymous.\n\"Safes? There's good money in them. You have to\nchoose your time carefully \u2014 middle of the night is\nbest.\n\"No, I don't have one here \u2014 you could try the bank\nround the corner though.\"\nDriving a safe is a simple technique to master. One\nhand on the steering handle, the other to turn the dial.\nIt does help having a good memory for figures.\nOne final word of warning \u2014 while most people now\naccept and even welcome safe drivers, several well-known safe breakers have had unfortunate brushes with\nthe law.\nLost and Found\nOn Wednesday afternoon, as a change to all the\nmundane and unimaginative sports, such as rugby and\nfootball, a few dedicated (and twisted) Guildsmen decided to right one of the faults of last year's exec. At\nthe beginning of last year a motion was passed to set in\nconcrete an anchor, believed to be UC's mascot. This\nwas never done until these intrepid artists decided to\nsculpture the work in Beit Quadrangle.\nAs it happened an odd bag of cement was in the\nUnion Store and sand was procured after a trip to the\nW2 site. Then our dynamic heroes, each armed with a;> ol, set forth to complete this righteous adventure,\nbefore closing time that afternoon, the anchor had been\nduly set in concrete and our workers retired to slake\ntheir thirsts at a local hostelry.\nThe sad (?) ending to this true-to-life drama is that\nthe anchor disappeared before the concrete had hard-e ned. Was this dastardly crime committed by UC, retrieving their unsightly object, or was it coincidence\nthat Beit Hall dinner was on Thursday night??\nFilms\n\"TEN DAYS WONDER\"\n(Director: Claude Chabrol) (Academy 1)\nWhat would it be like for a man to play God?\nIn his adaptation of Ellery Queen's novel Claude\nChabrol gives us a chilling insight of the inevitable\nconsequences of such an action.\nCharles (played by Anthony Perkins with all the\nintensity which made him so perfect in Psycho)\nwakes from a nightmare to find himself alone in a strange hotel room in Paris with blood on his\nhands. He begs for help from his philosophy professor Paul (Michael Piccoli) and persuades him to\npay a visit to his step-father's estate to find a logical solution to his problems. Paul arrives at the\nestate to discover that it is out of step with time:\nthe car which collects him from the station, the\nfurniture, the fashions, all belong in 1925, for Theo\nVan Horn, the stepfather (Orson Welles) has\ndecreed that time, at least on his estate, will stand\nstill at autumn 1925. The other inhabitants of Van\nHorn's \"world\" are Theo's child bride (Marlene\nJobert) who worships him and Theo's brother\nLudovic (Guido Alberti) who is the only person\ncapable of withstanding his overwhelming presence. Charles and Helene confess to Paul that they\nare lovers and are being blackmailed. Paul allows\nhimself to become implicated in Charles's clumsy\nattempts to buy off the blackmailer and eventually\nis forced to return home by Theo.\nDuring the journey the significance of the past\nnine days' events dawn on him and he returns to\nthe estate provoking tragedy to death. Even at this\nstage the story hasn't ended and the final reckon-ing, on the tenth day, is not played out until months\nlater.\nWith this film Chabrol has continued to develop\nhis beautifully atmospheric style which he used to\nsuch effect in \"The Butcher\" (still at Academy 2).\nChabrol's vision is that of Paul's professor, master\nof logic, overcoming the passions of Van Horn to\nhis puppets by reason alone. Chabrol opens up his\nClassical Music\nand You\nWithin a few paces of the Union Building stand\ntwo of London's important musical centres\u2014the\nRoyal College of Music and the Albert Hall. R.C.M., the training ground of tomorrow's maestros, occasionally hold free concerts which are often worth\ngoing to while the Albert Hall maintains the high\nmusical reputation of London with its many concerts (un for tu ant ely not free unless you happen to\nhave tails and a violin case handy).\nOne of the ever popular events which are staged\nat the Albert Hall is the Sunday night series of concerts as presented by Victor Hochhauser. These\nconcerts usually provide good performances of\npopular works and the one on 2nd October proved\nto be no exception. Conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in an all Beethoven evening was\n28 year old Andrew Davis.\nThe programme started with the Egmont Overture and it was soon clear that the conductor was\ngenerating an exciting response from his orchestra.\nNext came the 5th Piano Concerto with Miss Moura\nLympany, a frequent performer at the Albert Hall,\nas soloist. This was certainly a competent performance, both the orchestra and soloist playing well\ntogether and reaching its peak in Miss Lympany's truly beautiful interpretation of the second move-ment.\nFollowing the interval the Leonora No. 3 Overture\nwas played and as the evening progressed there was\nno doubt that Andrew Davis was very much in con-tro l. This was particularly evident in his conducting\nof the 5th Symphony which terminated the evening.\nWith the great number of top class performances of\nsymphonies available on record it is often easy to\nbe disappointed in the concert hall. Mr. Davis' con-ducting, however, managed to pass on just that bit\nmore than a technically correct performance of such\na well known work. Both the intellectual and dramatic power of the symphony came across to the audience and I am sure that much more will be heard of\nAndrew Davis in the future.\nSunday, October 15th, at the Albert Hall is an\nevening entitled 'A Night in Vienna', mainly music\nof Johann Strauss. Details of concerts in both the\nFestival and Albert Halls can be found on the notice\nboard in the college record library together with\nother information. If you can't make it to the live\nperformances there is a good selection of music\non record in the record library.\nAs mentioned in the last Felix, there will be a series of lectures on the symphony by Michael Hurd.\nHappy listening.\nHelene (MARLENE JOBERT) and Theo\n(ORSON WELLES) in a scene from \" TEN DAYS WONDER\" which also stars\nAnthony Perkins and Michel Piccoli. Produced by Andre Genoves and directed by\nClaude Chabrol.\nintellectual game even further introducing elements\nof witchcraft (through a meeting with Van Horn's mother) and with all manner of theological sym-bol isms each element finally fitting into the place\ndecreed it by fate.\nChabrol's associates excel themselves through-out. Jean Rabier's camera work is excellent from\nthe carefully angled shots of Charles waking, giving an intense feeling of disorientation to the dynamics of a car chase. The musical score by Pierre\nJansen is superbly menacing, making excellent\nuse of electronics.\nChabrol is rapidly developing a style of filmmaking which is unique. \"Ten Days Wonder\" is\njust a step towards Chabrol's ideal film\u2014whatever\nit may be, but a great one all the same.\nABOVE. Manfred Mann's Earthband, who went\ndown very well in the Great Hall on Saturday. Ents\nwould like to apologise for the non-appearance of\nFairport Convention who pulled out on us at very\nshort notice. With any luck Dick Heckstall-Smith's band should be appearing in the Great Hall this\nSaturday, followed by Lou Reed on the 21st October. Tickets are available now.\nRecords\n(continued from Page 7)\nan example. Apart from Cat Stevens' \"Portobello\nRoad\", Buddy Holly's\"I'm Gonna Love You Too\",\nvery similar to the original, and \"I'm Late\" by Hilliard/Fain, whoever they are, all the songs are\nAlun Davies' originals with wistful social comment\nand sentimental stuff about poverty, drunks, small\nanimals and love. Alun's voice, which sounds\nuncannily like that of his boss, doesn't help in\nestablishing this album as an original piece of work,\nbut if you like Cat Stevens, Neil Young, Jackson\nBrown, Jonie Mitchell, Melanie, etc., etc., give this\nalbum a try. If you don't... forget it.\n\n"

    "content": "Tuesday, October 10, 1972 FELIX Page S COMMUNITY\nACTION\nSimply, Imperial College Community\nAction Group exists to provide anyone who\nwishes to help the outside community with\nsuitable openings and to 'persuade' students\ninto wanting to give this assistance. The philosophy of Community Action is rather more\ncomplicated but really only becomes relevant\nwhen you are actually involved in doing some-thing. Therefore, I 'll get straight down to the\nhard stuff . . . ICC AG's activities.\nPlaygroups and\nAdventure Playgrounds\nCommunity Action has\na play group in the Ladbroke Grove area involving 50 kids between 2 and\n12 years old. This is\nroughly divided into a Saturday and, Sunday play group. We meet at\nZ.15 at St. Mark's Church\nin Lancaster Road. In\nfuture we may have use of\na basement or derelict\nhouse.\nThese play groups are\nbased around the ICCAG\nvan \u2014 outings to Richmond Park, Science Museum, Adventure Playgrounds, etc.\nThe playgrounds we are\ninvolved with are Acklam\nRoad (under Westway),\nLisson Grove and Marylands and Lanhill. They\nrequire people who are\nwilling regularly one or\ntwo evenings a week or\nthe occasional weekend.\nNo particular skills are\nrequired, just the ability\nto relate to kids of varying ages.\n\"Insight\"\n\"Insight\" is a commune\nor \"stabilizing centre\"\naccommodating fixing addicts who they hope eventually to get on a withdrawal programme. It is\nsituated in a terraced\nhouse at 101 Rushmore\nRoad, Hackney, E7, totally inconspicuous and so\nletting its residents lead a normal life in the com-m unity. Caring for people such\nas these requires a24 hour watch and at present\nonly two workers can\nhardly cope. Help is desperately needed. They require I, Part time workers\nparticularly at weekends.\n2, Co-workers to stay up\nall night during the week-end. 3, Volunteers for a' jumble sale\u2014 (a) To distribute leaflets; (b) collect\njumble; (c) organise the\nhall on the day of the\nsale. 4, Suggestions of\npossible fund raising ac-ti vi ties.5, Full-time workers (if you feel like dropping out!)\nSoup Run.\nThis occurs at present\nevery Friday night under\nCharing X bridge and\nTemple Gardens and involves dishing out soup to\nthe homeless people who\nlive there, and also chatting to them and building\nup a relationship with\neach one as an individual.\nIt usually starts at about\neleven to twelve midnight\nand lasts about two hours,\nand most if not all Fridays the ICCAG van will\nbe available to transport\nthe soup and people.\nMaryland and Lanhill\nTenants' Association\nThe Association meet ii every Monday night in\nNorth Paddington. It is\nrun by local residents and\nstudents.\nWhy should such a group need to exist?\nWell, in a landlord-ten-ant confrontation, the\nlandlord usually comes off\nbest. This is especially\ntrue of the Westminster\nCity Council and their\nattitude towards the tenants of the area with the\nresult that they are being\nforced to move or pay\nhigher rents.\nHowever, with the help\nof the group, tenants can\nbe made aware of their\nlegal rights (never very\nwell publicized) and they\nwere able to start their\nhave a mouthpiece\nthrough which their views\ncan be expressed. During\nthe past year the group\nhas informed tenants of\nthe effects of the 'General\nImprovement Area\nScheme' and. the 'Fair\nRents' Act, as well as\nsorting out legal problems. Also, with the help\nof money from the I.C. Rag two years ago, they\nown paper, the 'North\nPad. News'.\nAll these activities,\nhowever, require a good\ndeal of manpower. Anyone interested in the Association and its work will\nlearn a great deal about\ntenants' rights by going\nalong to help out ... You\nmight even find it useful\nyourself one day!\nSquatters\nThere arc many families who arc condemned\nto live in very overcrowded conditions \u2014\nquite frequently in rooms\nseething with damp. But\nhave you noticed that\nthere arc always empty\nhouses around, boarded\nup and waiting for demo-lit ion? Yet they frequently\nstand idle for two or three\nyears.\nThe North Pad. Squatters Association has been\ntrying to correct this conflicting situation by arranging with Westminster\nCity Council for such\nfamilies to be temporarily\nhoused in these buildings.\nAs a community, the rehoused families will work\ntogether to decorate them\nand will pay a nominal\nrent to the Council.\nThis legal squatting\nscheme has been in operation in Brentford and\nCamden for over a year,\nand has been shown to\nwork well. Help is needed\nin locating empty houses,\nin publicity and in decor-a ting; and for those who\nare really interested, help\nin the group's organ iz a tion.\nThese are only a few of\nthe activities. We are as lo involved in visiting lonely\nold people, running blood\ndo ning sessions in College,\ndecorating weekends, etc.\nWe hope to continuously\nbe introducing new activities \u2014 so keep in touch.\nWe also have strong\nlinks with other organizations and Student Community Action Groups\nand we could probably\nput you in touch with\nanyone to do anything.\nPLEASE HELP\nFor more info, contact\nMalcolm Matthews (Sel-kirk 476).\nQUEEN\nOF19723 Last year, if there ever WAS\na Queen of Jez, no one knew\nwho she was, since there was\nso much trouble over the ele c tion. This year, Jacqui, who\nis in Maths I, got herself\nelected at the first RCS union\nmeeting of the year.\nWe're afraid we can't tell\nyou what Jacqui thinks of the\npost or the honour because our\nreporter just took her picture\nand didn't send an interview\n. . . but she looks fairly happy\nwith life even after a week at\nI.C.

It won't have done your heart any\ngood, let alone your mind, but at least the rest of the\nyear will be a walk-over by comparison. How much\nsherry did YOU get through? Pig. I only had two\nglasses all week. That was too much for me, too.\nMust eat something with it next time. You had cheese\ntoo at your reception? Some people have all the luck.\nCouldn't you sleep either? Ah well. At least I didn't suffer from constipation and air-sickness like everybody else. You did? I'm not surprised. Surprised that\nyou didn't get Yellow Fever as well. Oh, I am sorry.\nFour weeks' quarantine? Lucky you. Could do with a rest cure myself. Not surprised that you got migraine\nwith a'li hat walking around.\nDid you know that I got through two pairs of shoes\nlistening to Tuesday's Union Meeting?\nIf you felt that way too about Imperial College's Freshers' \"Festival\", you may be interested to know\nthat, according to \"Redbrick\", newspaper of Birmingham University, that the aim of such an event is \"to\ngently introduce the new intake to University life in\na relaxed and informal manner: to so overwhelm its\npimply charges that the absence of mum and dad and\nthe dog are quite forgotten\". Yeah. It would seem to\nsucceed in overwhelming those poor people who have\ncome to Imperial College for the first time. It certainly\nsucceeds admirably in overwhelming all those who\nare experiencing it once again, often for the third or\nfourth time. It does, however, fail as regards the\n\"gentle\" aspect. And the overwhelming part of it, far\nfrom making-freshmen forget mum and dad and the\ndog probably maks most of them wish that they could\nrun straight back to them.\nSurely the aim of the Freshers' Week, though, should\nbe to tell \"the story so far\" and explain the functioning\nand structure of the University and College. It should\naim to put freshmen sufficiently \"in the picture\" to\nmake the term \"freshman\" irrelevant by the end of\nthat week. Yet if you are one of the unfortunates at\nwhom this tournament of frenzy.was aimed, it is quite\nlikely i that you are just as confused as you were at the\nbeginning of the week, if not more so. If you consider\nthat you now have a vague knowledge of the functions\nand workings of the University, College or Union you\nmay count the reception and retention powers of your\nmind as being of quite exceptional calibre.\nShould you not be so fortunate, like most of us, may\n1 make the earnest request that you do not either run\nback home or adopt ostrich tactics. Like every other\ngeneration of IC students has done before you, you\nwill have to find out as you go along. It is probably\nbetter that way. We could have filled up our first issue\nof the year with names of people and things and\nwhat-happens-where-and-when and the like. But it\nwould almost certainly have confused you even more\nthan you already were. So we didn't. It is worth trying to find out about the workings of\nthe college. It is an intriguing and unique institution.\nYou will never learn all that there is to know about\nk. Many tales of mystery, intrigue, suspense and slander\nare associated with it. Many books could be written\nabout it. Doubtless one day a part-work encyclopaedia\nof the place will be published. Until then, you will have\nto find out what you. can for yourself.\nWith \"Felix's\" help. From next week, as a service\nto readers, we shall be publishing profiles of the\n\"Hierarchy of College Block\". (College Block, fear not.\nWe come to help you, not to slander you). It will\ntake us a good number of weeks to get through. We\nshall also be publishing other information about the\nworkings of this venerable institution\nBut this is getting away from Freshers' Week. It\nneeds reform. It needs to work. Tt can be changed. But\nwhat to? \"Felix\" invites letters from both those of you\nnew to IC (let's stop calling you \"fresher s\") and those\nof you who are \"old hands\" on your views on the\nsubject . . . . by Friday, please, for inclusion in the\nnext issue.\nPOSTSCRIPT\nGuidance, please, as to whether \"Freshman\" refers\nto a man who is (a) un preserved,( b) invigorating (c) not stale, faded or soiled or (d) makes obnoxious\nadvances.\nPARKING PERMITS The following students have been allocated parking spaces for the current session.\nThey should collect their permits from the Union office at the beginning of NEXT\nweek.

In\nall such distressing cases,\nthe cure is painful and\ndifficult to watch, but is\nnonetheless necessary.\nThe problem is basically one of money, power\nand mistaken ideas, all\nmixing together to produce a very virulent strain\nof the disease; economic\nbenefits to a community\nare always accepted no\nmatter how they are arrived at; power invariably\ncomes to (and stays with)\nthose who appear to make\nthese benefits possible\nHow is it, though, that\nsuch a situation could\nex i ot for so long without\nchange? This leads to the\nconcept of \"unconditional\nreadmittance\" which is a privilege bestowed on the\nfavoured followers of\nthose who have the power.\nIn this way, the belief in\nthe invulnerability of the\nclique members grows,\nand in fact is (at the mo-ment) quite justified.\nHence, we see here a group of people who have\ncontrol over the most valuable privilege available\npray\nwithin the present system:\na virtual guarantee of a2nd year in Hall (not to\nmention a3rd year given\nto the established lead-ers). Why else would people jump head over heels\nto get elected (sorry,\nSelected) to the assembly\nmentioned?\nAt first glance, there\nappears to be no hope for\nthe patient, but closer examination of the tumour,\nshows if hat bits are breaking away. A recent outburst by the \"Linstead\nHall Newsheet\" which\nsays it is published \"for\nand on behalf of the Hall\nCommittee\" (i.e. by two\nor three members of THE\nGROUP) shows the\ncracks beginning to ap-pear.\nUnlike certain African\npoliticians, they are as yet\nunable to deport undesirable aliens and so have\nresorted to fairly standard\nmethods of mud-slinging,\nin an incredibly amateurish manner.\nNo more need be said\ntherefore before 1 ask you\nto join me in prayer for\nthis mentally ill patient\nwho will, we hope, re-cover.\nTHE MODERATOR OF\nTHE CHURCH OF\nSCOTLAND\nMascotry\nSir, v.I was horrified to find\nin your none-too-imp res sive first issue of FELIX,\nan article bemoaning the\ndecline of mascot ry. Do we really need an\nenormous miro meter to\nmake I.C.a better place?\nHave we really nothing\nbetter to do than spend\nhalf the year trying to\nsteal cons it it u ent college\nmascots?\nThe writer of the article\nwould appear to delight in\nwallowing in the past,\nwhen such an organisation\nas WHO served only to\npander to the destructive\nwhims of a narrow clique.\nThank goodness that we\nnow have such worthwhile\ncauses as Community Action for students to spend\ntheir time on.\nIf I am wrong, and it\nreally takes an incomprehensible chant to bring\nback a \"Sporting Spirit\"\nto l.C, then these really\nare Black days.\nYours faithfully,\nSIR ALFRED\nRESIDENT\nName (Dept.)

The\nrace started the season of foolish events that\nare planned to follow. To those not used to\nragging, a tiddlywinks race may seem to be\nrather tame. Well, maybe so under normal\ncircumstances. But SUK are a little more\nbloody-minded than your average tid d ly win ker. So they hold their race down Oxford\nStreet at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning.\nThe FELIX reporter, not having the luck to live in\nHall did not get fortuitously awakened by loud hail ers outside his window at 9.45 a.m. Yet he did succeed in\narriving at Marble Arch by the appointed hour of 10.\nThe story continues . . .\n\"The first apprehensions\nof being the only win ker on show were soon dissolved by the sight of at least\none hundred other idiots\n(fresher s being well represented) and all were in a rather gay mood. Passersby at this stage seemed to\nbe quite unsuspecting of\nthe implications of such a body of students, but when\nthe signal came from the\nleader to cross Oxford\nStreet there were many\na gasp as determined wink-ers strode forward on their\nunprotected knees.\nCOCKROACHES\nFew cockroaches were\nencountered but winks\noften came to a sticky end\nas they rolled away down\ndrains and miscellaneous\ngratings, or even stickier\nends on patches of used\nbubble - gum. Casualty\nrates were high; one reporter from a scene of\nfit\nsome of the most catastrophic winking declared\nthat as many as three\nwinks had gone west, and\nnone had been recovered.\nDETERMINED\nOthers pressed on deter-mined ly, and I witnessed\nthe fall of Selfridges' and\nthe horrors of escalator\nwink fare. The CIA have\ndenied any responsibility.\nMICK McMANUS\nThe police were considered marvellous: they\nturned up in considerable\nnumbers, and lent the\noccasion a distinct air of\nauthority. However, serious resistance was met\nfrom a Traffic Warden resembling Mick McManus's big sister (no offence\nmeant) and who fiercely\nbrandished her mouth-piece, exhorting the masses\nto wink only on the pave-ment s. BODIES\nBy this time, I got\nseparated from the main\nbody, or rather bodies, and\nonly some of the disabled\nlurked in doorways, collection tins still rotting in\ntheir bloodied hands.\nLater reports put the\nmoney collected at ap*\nproximate ly \u00a3345, although confirmation is\nawaited. No reports of\nfatalities as a result of the\nevent have been received.\nHave you\ngot\nknobbly knees?\nThen you could be\nMrI CW A! \u2014 and help the ladies of I.C. nomination\nforms on\nICWA Noticeboard\nnow\n\n"

But so often NUS appears to\nbe totally unrepresentative. How can we hope to make\nNUS more representative if we don't get our own opinions sorted out, and ensure that our conference delegation takes these views forward.\nBy the way, the post of Chairman of Debates is vacant\nso we'd like to hear in the Union Office of anyone interested in this or just helping out with arrangements and\npublicity.\nFinally a call for\nHELP!! with the thousand and one things that need doing\naround the Union, especially in the publicity field. Come\nalong to the Union Office and report for duty!\nImperial College is a vast, sprawling complex\nof dilapidated buildings, a site of learning, a place\nfor adding a little quality\nto living, somewhere to\ndrink, to eat, to play\ngames. The only time\nduring the year when\nImperial College gets to\nform a corporate whole\nis on Commemoration\nDay.\nWhen an IC man grad-u at es, he not only gets aB. Sc. or BSc(Eng) degree,\nhe is also awarded the\nAssociateship of his constituent college \u2014 an\nARCS, ARSM or ACGI.\nThese are more than just\na 'free gift' with a degree;\nthey are qualifications in\ntheir own right and it is\npossible in certain circumstances to get an\nAssociateship without a degree.\nCommemoration Day is so called because it\nCommemorates the visit\nto the college in 1945 of\nthe late King George and\nQueen Elizabeth. The ceremonies are in many ways\nanalogous to a school\nSpeech Day i.e. tedious,\nboring and really designed\nfor the benefit of one's Mummy and Daddy.\nHowever since one's parents will probably want to\nsee their little Johnny\nwalk round the Royal Albert Hall when he graduates, I would advise\npeople to go to Commem.\nat least once during their\ntime at IC so that they\ncan explain what actually\nhappens\u2014and also to get\na free tea afterwards.\niii iii iiii III Commem. may seem to\nbe boring and tedious,\nbut it is the only day in\nthe College Year when the\ncollege appears together\nin one place wearing tech-nicol our robes. It culminates in the Commemoration Ball. This year, for\nthe first time ever, the\nCommem. Ball is to be\nheld within the hallowed\nprecincts of IC in order\nto try and stop the trend\nof rising prices in outside\nHotels. There will be an\nAl grade meal of five\ncourses plus wines and\nport as well as 'Entertain-ment' for the incredibly\nlow price of \u00a34.50 per\ndouble ticket. Further details including ticket application forms can be\nobtained from Linda\nin the Union Office.\nSO YOU THINK YOU\nKNOW ABOUT THE\nIC BOOICSHOP\nWe all know that the IC bookshop sells\nhooks. Even if you've never been in it, you\nknow that, because it is obvious. But did\nyou know about all the other things that\nthe IC Bookshop sells? Like pens, pencils,\nrulers, set squares, notepaper, file paper,\ntypewriters, ties, scarves, badges, diaries,\nhole puncher s, treasury tags, slide rules,\npaper clips, tights, exam papers (maybe\nwe'd better forget that one), birthday\ncards, paper handkerchiefs, scarves,\nwhew, Christmas cards (post early for\nEaster), rapid o graph pens, geological\nhammers, french curves (oh ducky), dye-line paper and developer, drawing instruments, it goes on and on.\nAs for books, don't think that it's just\ntextbooks that they sell. Whether your\nfancies lie with Puerto Rican architecture\nor novels, you'll find books to suit your\nbedside table at the IC BOOKSHOP. Not\nforgetting in valuables like \"Alternative\nLondon\" and \"Time Out's book of London\", and even magazines too.\nAdmit it. Isn't it time that you paid a visit to the IC BOOKSHOP ? You never\nknow what you might find. But you'll need\nit sooner or later.\n\n"

G.M. in the Great Hall.\" It being my\nfirst breathtaking day at I.C.,I felt inclined\nto agree, nice to meet the student body in\nthe flesh, as it were. As we entered the\nGreat Hall considerable confusion seemed\nto reign, and being very shy we sat at the\nback. In fact, so did everybody else, so\nmuch so that the exec, were obliged to bring\ntheir tables down to us.\nAfter much coughing\nand belching into the\nmicrophone, Ian Mackenzie, acting as President of the Union (why\ncan't one see the real\none??) spoke to us in\nlow monotones. Execstyle people rushed\naround giving away\nyellow sheets of paper\nwhich were intelligently\nconverted into paper\ndarts. Needless to say,\nthe aero engineers' darts\nflew much better than\nthe rest. (I wonder what\ndepartment you're in?\u2014\nEd.)\nMy attention to much\nof the valuable information imparted to us was\nsomewhat hindered by\nMandy's caresses (my\nmother wouldn't like\nMandy). Martin Black\nseductively railroaded\nsecond readings of\nnumerous motions (can\nMartin Black seduce\nanything? That is surely\nthe question\u2014Ed.) as the\nacting president nodded\nhis head in approval.\nBut my sexual stupor\nwas abruptly interrupted by the audience disagreeing with the idea\nthat the exec ought to be\nable to impose unlimited\nfines on naples s unruly\nstudents; but Martin\nBlack wanted to be\n\"consistent\", and the\nexec u rallied round to\nhelp him; \"No Hassles\"\npurred the deputy president and Mandy moaned. But the rest of\nthe student body was not\nto be so stimulated.\nMaking the best of a bad job, Commander\nBlack and Company\nurged the delights of\n'Council'; a few hands\nwaved and the offending\npiece of inconsistency\nwas dropped into a bucket labelled 'Council'.\nWatch out if you stub\nout your dog ends on the\ncolour T.V. You might\nincur some Ultra - Violence from the Commander and his heavies.\nFeeling a worried per-son, I led Mandy off in\nsearch of the old I and\nO.I.C. U.

The weather\nwas not just dry but hot, the groups were, for the\nmost part, excellent, and it only cost a quid, whoops\nwhat did I say? However, the afternoon ended with\nsome rather perplexing scenes of violence which\ndoubt had our eiders shaking their heads and saying \"Long-haired, pot-smoking, filthy, lazy and\nviolent hippies.\"\nOver then to one such\nhippy Mr. Clock Workorange (no relation)\n\"Like man when the cats\nstand up I gotta make\nthem sit down again, ya\ndig? And those redneck newspaper sellers,\nI mean they're so un cool they just ask you to\nthrow things at them.\"\nFar out man, but isn't there a difference between standing up to get\nan ultra-good view at\nsomeone else's expense\nand standing up briefly\nto applaud. And again\nthere's a difference between lobbing a Coke\ntin to attract someone's attention and hurling a ha If-full tin of Party\nSeven with intent to\nmaim. Ah well.\nNow to proceed to\nthe music. The concert\nwas arranged to commemorate the presentation\nof the Melody Maker\nPollwinner's awards, although the eventual lineup wandered a little\nfrom that description.\nFirst on was Fudd, an\nIrish group who, Rikki\nFarr assured us, had\nplayed to an audience of\n7,000 in Dublin three\ndays previously, but that\nmay have been because\nno top British bands ever\nplay there; Fudd w fer e not particularly original\nand of course no one had\nheard of them, so they\nwere not well received\nand didn't play for long.\nFocus, first of the\npoll winning groups, came on next and\nshowed why they were\nvoted World's Brightest\nHope with a flawless\nset, perhaps marred by\nthe tendency to revert to\nthe theme of their most\nfamous song, \"Hocus\nPocus\" in other songs,\nbut then it's a superb\npiece of music. Tys van\nLeer's falsetto voice is\nquite unique (sic). In\nthe next year Focus (they\nare Dutch) will prove\nthat you don't have to be\nBritish or American to\nmake the grade. They\nhave a new album out\nsoon.\nNext on \u2014 the intervals between the groups\nrock c it the Oval\nwere never annoyingly\nlong \u2014 were Genesis,\nwho came sixth in the\n\"British Brightest Hope\"\nsections of the Poll. The\ngroup rely on the atri csa lot, and their songs are\nbuilt round complicated\nstories such as \"Get 'em\nOut by Friday\" and \"The\nReturn of the Giant Hogweed\", whose stories\nare explained beforehand by singer Peter\nGabriel around whom\nthe the at ric s evolve. On\none occasion he left the\nstage obviously^\ngive the group an instrument workout, I thought.\nbut no \u2014 he was back\non stage in a couple of\nminutes wearing a long\ndress and a fox's head.\nI don't remember which\npiece it was part of, but\ndoubtless all will be revealed on their new\nalbum \"Foxtrot\" or when\nthey play at I.C. on November 18.\nArgent were very\nordinary. Guitarist Russ\nBallard has written\nsome good songs in the\npast, not the least of\nthem \"Hold Your Head\nUp\" but' the group put\nthem across as though\nthe audience should be\non their feet the whole\ntime, and the songs just\naren't that exciting. Towards the end of their\nset, as they felt the audience slipping from\ntheir grasp, the songs\nand their inane patter in\nbetween became just a bore. \"A big hand for\none of Britain's best\ndrummers\", etc. Some\nnew songs and a tighter,\nless exhibitionist delivery of them may return\nsome respect for Argent.\nThe crowd, already anticipating the arrival of\nEmerson, Lake and\nPalmer, had very little.\nAfter Argent had left\nthe stage, not surprisingly without encore, it\nwas announced that\nthere was a surprise for\nus. Drummer Pierre van\nder Linden and guitarist\nJan Akkerman, both of\nFocus, were going\nto jam with the world's best bass guitarist\n(as voted for by\nMelody Maker readers),\nJack Bruce. It may not\ngo down in the history\nof jam sessions as a vintage one, but considering that Bruce had probably never met the\nothers before, they \"got\nit together\" very well,\nand it was a nice way to\npass the time while\nE. L.P.'s gear was set up.\nAlan Freeman, probably E. L.P.'s most objectionable fan, introduced\nthem, and they launched\nstraight into \"Hoedown\"\nfrom the new album,\nand it was received with\nthe appropriate ecstasy\nthat typifies their con-cert s. It would perhaps\nbe unfair to say that\nthere were no surprises\nin what they played, although this number was\na carbon copy of the recorded version. The next\npiece was \"Tarkus\" and\ntwo huge model \"Tar-k uses\" as seen on the\nalbum cover, belching\ncoloured smoke, were\nrevealed on the stage.\nApart from these visual\naids the number was for\nme their best, with Greg\nLake launching into\n\"Epitaph\" during his\n\"bit\", and Keith\nEmerson prancing about\nwith his Moog ke-board and still finding\ntime to play some of\n\"Peer Gynt\". There's little more that can be\nsaid about the group that\nhasn't been said before,\nand this article's getting\nquite long anyway, but\nthe other numbers were\n\"The Endless Enigma\",\n\"Sheriff\", about half of\n\"Pictures at an Exhibition\", \"Take a Pebble\"\nwith bits of \"Lucky\nMan\" and \"Five Bridges\nSuite\", and as an encore\n\"Rondo\", featuring\nKeith's knife routine and\nCarl Palmer's solo,\nrather boring for such a good drummer.\nWishbone Ash had\nthe unenviable task of\nfollowing E.L. P., and I must admit I didn't stop\nto see them. I'm sure\neveryone who did was a fan of theirs, and that\nthey went down well,\nand my condolences go\nto anyone who was injured by flying tins and\nbottles.\nrecords\nAlun Davies' record company have showered us\nwith bump h and a photograph of him should be\nnext to this article; handsome creature isn't he.\nDefinitely the type of musician girls will go wild\nover at his solo concerts. So it's rather a pity\nthat he's Cat Steven's guitarist and only appears\nlive with him. It's also a pity that all the bump h is wasted, on me at least, because I don't like this\nalbum very much.\nI won't deny that Alun Davies is an accomplished,\nand dextrous guitar player, I mean Cat Stevens\nwouldn't just go for yer average guitar player,\nwould he? The production, by Cat Stevens who\nalso played piano is also impeccable. But I( and\nprobably Joe Public) just don't get off on the\nsinger-songwriter album of which this is certainly\nCont. page 6\nthe\nreviews\npage\ntheatre\nWhen it originally appeared at the Royal Court\nover two years ago, there was wild critical praise\nfor \"The Philanthropist\" (now Mayfair). I did not\nsee it until very recently and, quite frankly, I was\nrather disappointed. Maybe the production has,\nlike so many others, become distorted with the passage of time \u2014 or maybe I'm in the wrong.\nThe Philanthropist in the title is a University Don\nwho, basically, is too kind. He is an English Philologist (the study of words: no, I did not know that\neither), because \"I have never had the critical\nfacility for Literature\", and in his weakness, he\nsleeps with a girl he does not want to and loses his\nfiancee.\nChristopher Hampton makes some very cogent\npoints in this comedy of his \u2014 and there are\nsome very funny lines and moments, but the problem is that the play is rather unbelievable. It is\nimpossible to see how Philip (the Philanthropist)\never came to be engaged to his girl, and even\nharder to see how he retains the attention of so\nmany people. He is so obvious in his total weakness.\nBut ! think I do the playwright less than justice\nif I lay the blame on him. The show has been running too long, and has grown stale. It's a pity.\npaperbacks\n,'The grain in the holds of MV Agacucho City\nis destined for a Middle East devastated by earth-quakes. But a hi-jacking fanatic armed with the\nlethal germ Antrax-B turns this errand of mercy\ninto potential genocide \u2014\u2022 and the cargo into eight\nthousand tons of golden death . . . .\"\nBrian Callison's\" A Plague of Sailors\" (Fontana,\n30p) make Alistair MacLean's novels seem like\nGibbon's \"Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\". In\na way this novel is a brave attempt at trying to\ncapture the drama of the present Palestinian conflict and although it uses present day characters\nas heads of state and in some instances puts into\nwords and actions a lot of what the world fears\ncould happen in the light of the recent spate of\nterrorism, I still found it superficial and at times\nlaughable. Laughable in the manner that the herd\nled such a charmed life amongst the guns and\nbombs of the Arab agents.\nHowever, Brian Callison cannot be accused of\nletting his story stand still, the action jumps from\nScotland to the States and finally to the Mediterranean where most of the action is set. As with\nmost novels of this sort crime doesn't pay and\nthe terrorists get their just rewards (?). Cliche\nrings upon clich e in a plot which appears to be a calculated distillation of all the thrillers that have\ngone before.\nIn \"The Toxic Metals\" (Pan/Ballantine, 50p), Anthony Tucker presents a saga of tragedy and\ncomplacency as Governments and health authorities turn a blind eye to heavy metal pollution. Perhaps quite rightly he draws our attention to these\ndangers carefully pointing out in an ordinary language how these metals act on animal and marine\nlife and finally the body. However, his method of\nfollowing through the history of metal poisoning\ncases I quite honestly found boring.\nThere is probably nothing very new to be found\nin this book by any science or engineering student\nwho has bothered to read the recent articles in the\nSunday papers. Mr. Tucker tends to spend too\nlong discussing the problems and too little time\nthe solutions . . . . Oh well, the same old problem!\n\n"
