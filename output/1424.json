Enjoy!\n\t\t\t Jov\nThe Italian job\nHockey\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XI 1\nC.U.S. Pisa Youth XI 5\nIt was a difficult task to follow up last\nyear\u2019s tour weekend to Amsterdam but\nwith Santa\u2019s Little Helper\u2019s mafia contacts in his homeland a trip to Pisa and\nFlorence was no problem.\nWe rocked up in Pisa at midnight on\nthe Friday and it wasn\u2019t long before an\nIrish pub was found and of lesser im-portance, our accommodation for the\nnight/early morning.\nAfter informing the Pisa hockey\nclub that we were in a national hockey\nleague, big mistake by Santa\u2019s Little\nHelper, they sent out their youth team\nand it turned out not to be the kind of\ngame we had anticipated.\nThe pitch was your average away\ngame pitch with mountain views and\ngrandstand and our only hope was that\nat 1-0 down they would revert to the\nItalian mentality of sitting back and de-fending. Error.\nHowever, the use of eight substitutes\nhelped in the first half with good performances from players who the DeIViants had missed for much the season\nsuch as Alcaseltza and Karma Suture.\nThe half ended 1-1 with Mr Pacman\ncancelling out the Pisa goal. In the second half three quick goals and far too\nmuch running took its toll and we were\nnot used to playing in the sun.\nImperial Hockey men\u2019s 4ths go to Pisa for a one off game\nElliott Dye\nOn to Florence it was for the remainder of Saturday, with the accommodation ideally situated next to a nunnery.\nWe headed for central Florence for our\nlargest meal & fines circle of the season with heavy fines for newly named\nFreshly Squeezed and also for Easy Access due to his recent antics.\nThe main problem anyone will find\nwhen going out in Florence is the poor\nvalue of the pound with most drinks\naround \u20ac5. Regardless, the city itself\nwas stunning at night and in the day,\nthough the English rain on Sunday\ndidn\u2019t help. We were more grateful\nof the rain on our return, with heavy\nsnowfall greeting us as we arrived.\nWe will now have to be content with\ncontinuing winning ways in BUCS and\nULU.\nEngland train at Harlington\nMustapher Botchway\nLast Monday Sport Imperial and Harlington were host to the England Rugby\n6 Nations squad for a training session.\nThey were preparing for Saturday\u2019s\nmatch against 2008 winners, Wales.\nSport Imperial were able to accommodate the squad at short notice after\nThe Stoop, their usual training ground\nand other pitches in the area were\nflooded or waterlogged due to the extreme weather conditions of the previous week.\nEngland trained on the 3G (astro-turf) pitch, which is more commonly\nused by Queens Park Rangers FC and\nthe College football teams. Coincidentally, ICURFC also trained on the pitch\nMonday evening.\nThe indoor gym facilities of The\nThird Runway, the latest moniker for\nFortress Harlington were also used by\nthe national team which pleased the\nHead Coach Martin Johnson as his\ncharges were able to have an intensive training session, possible gaining\na one-up over their more north-based\nrivals.\nAfter an unconvincing victory over\nItaly last Saturday England are looking\nto reverse last year\u2019s 19-26 loss to Wales\nin the 2008 6 Nations Championship.\nThe team have signed a rugby shirt\nto be awarded to one lucky winner at\nVarsity on the 25th February which\nwill certainly pique\u00e9 the interest of all\nyou paraphernalia fans out there.\nA\nfter almost two weeks\nof hibernation for the\noutdoor sports things\nare gradually returning\nto normal with only a\nthird of Harlington being playable on\nWednesday!\nIt seems that Varsity preparation\nhas severely curtailed the availability\nof our captains. Surprisingly both the\nMedical School and College football\nmen\u2019s 1st XI captains couldn\u2019t participate in an interview. Expect a double\nwhammy next week.\nContinuing, we would like you turn\nback a page (obviously after reading\nthis \u2018informative\u2019 column) to see a hint\nof what the Varsity magazine is to look\nlike. Building on the success of last\nyears pullout Jack, Jov and myself are\ncreating a magazine, in a similar vain\nto Another Castle, i,science and Phoenix the gaming, science and arts magazines respectively. This will be Varsity\ncentric with hopefully all of the participating sports having some column\ninches. If you would like to produce\nsomething for the magazine, flick your\ncontribution to sport.felix@imperial.\nac.uk.\nStaying on topic, we\u2019re here to serve\nthe student body so if you have any ideas or suggestions please email us and\nwe\u2019ll try our best to implement them if\nthey are viable.\nThe second term normally means\nknockout competitions, ACC bar\nnights, club dinners, and elections.\nJack Cornish &\nMustapher Botchway\nSports Editors\nExtra,Extra.\nReadallaboutit!\nImperial teams are well represented in\nthe latter stages of both the BUCS and\nULU cups and we hope the silverware\nwill be in abundance come the end of\nterm.\nWednesday night\u2019s ACC bar night\nwas as always, good fun, though I think\npostponing it for a week got a few people overexcited which ultimately led to\na false fire alarm. Keep your elbows to\nyourselves people and keep the inter-sport rivalry friendly!\nClub dinner is the flagship event in\nthe calendar for most of the clubs and\nI can do nothing but strongly recommend it. These events normally attract\noldboys/girls so for all you freshers out\nthere you will get the chance to meet\nand socialise with former legends of\nyour club. Start saving up!\nAlong with the sabb elections later on\nthis term there will be elections for the\ncommittee for the various sports clubs\nat IC. If you are interested in having an\nimpact on your club next year try and\nspeak to the current committee to gain\nan insight on the running of your club.\nI would like to congratulate the RSM\nmen\u2019s 1st XI team in their victory\nagainst ICUAFC 7th XI. The score was\nin fact 3-1 not 3-2 as reported in the\nlast issue. Along with James Brown\u2019s\ncomical explanation for his side\u2019s loss,\nthe hockey men\u2019s 4th team seem to be\nliving the life, being able to travel to\nPisa to play a youth team!

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 13 February 2009 felix\nArts\nPrepare for total entertainment\nVisual synaesthetics by the hottest international VJs? A three hour film pondering the fundamental\nabsurdness of existence? Nah. Give me old-school entertainment any day, says Emilie Beauchamp\nThe Carnival comes to town\nRosie Milton attends the Tate Triennial and attempts to connect the dots in a cavalcade of global art\nW\nhen I heard that Les\n7 Doigts de la Main\n(literal translation:\nThe seven fingers\nof the hand) were\nin London, I was gladly surprised to\nsee that this French Canadian circus\ncompany had made it to this side of the\ncontinent!\nWell, apparently they had already\nbeen at the Edinburgh Festival in 2007,\ncreating a commotion with their new\napproach to circus, mixing disciplines\nand acrobatics in astonishing ways. Les\n7 doigts de la main are now in London\nuntil March 14th with their new show,\nTraces, which critics have already ac-claimed, saying this show will make\nyou drop everything and enrol in the\nnearest circus school... Being from\nMontreal, but having failed to go see\nthem in their \u201chometown\u201d, I was very\nexcited to finally discover the cause of\nall the praise!\nLes 7 doigts de la main started in\n2002 in Montreal from a mix of artists graduating from Montreal\u2019s Ecole\nNationale du Cirque and slowly made\ntheir way up the ladder of success. In\nthis second production of theirs, they\nelected to premier five young artists fresh out of school to feature in a\ndoomsday situation where they are all\nstuck in a bunker, with an unknown catastrophe outside the door.\nThe idea is to see how they live and\nexpress themselves in what is meant to\nbe the last hours of their lives, using\ncreativity as a remedy to annihilation,\nso to \u201cleave their traces as best they\ncan\u201d\u2026 They do so by first presenting\nthemselves to the crowd.\nFrom the beginning, you can see they\nuse a very interactive and communicative way to convey their message and\nexchange with the crowd. We thus\nmeet Will, Heloise, Brad, Francisco\nand Philip. They confess to us stories\nof their life, share songs and dance, sal-sa, hip and hop around the stage with\nbasketballs and skateboards\u2026 Oh, and\nthey\u2019re also acrobats by the way\u2026\nThey all have their strengths and\nweaknesses and a few lapses could be\nobserved throughout the performanc-es, but improvisation and great team\nwork easily repaired any damage. All\nwere amazing at hand balancing, tumbling and Chinese poles, while other\nspecializations included the German\nwheel and the teeterboard.\nThe star of the show is without doubt\nHeloise Bourgeois, the only girl in the\ntroop, who used to excel in equestrian vaulting, trampoline and dance\namongst other skills. The centerpiece\nof the group, she is a mix of sensual\nwaltz and pure strength, exalting talent\nthroughout the entire show. But all of\nthem are worth special mentions, most\nof them being also trained in various\nside expertises such as classical and\njazz piano, magic tricks, painting and\neven the Didgeridoo!\nDivided into about 10 scenes, the\nshow allowed each of the artists to perform their acrobatics individually but\nalso as a group. While all of the scenes\npresent some form of acrobatics or\ntumbling, many feature different types\nof contemporary, urban dancing. These\nwere very artistically interesting, but\nhoweverweredefinitelynotthestrength\nof the performers, some of them looking slightly not at ease. And while it is\nunderstandable that a 120 minute show\nwith only acrobatics would be totally\nexhausting for the performers, I guess\nthey are so good at it that you just want\nmore of it and less dancing.\nStill, the constant humor and pleasantry contained in the skits make every\none of them fascinating. Moreover, the\nmusicchoicesarebulls-eyeinsyncwith\nthe performances and the choreogra-phies; urban, eclectic and dynamic.\nFinally, this new wave modern circus\ntroop really succeeds in this innovative\nand more sensitive approach to en-tertainment, acrobatics and dance. In\nshort, Traces is an amazing chance to\ndiscover what circus is all about these\ndays and is definitely a good alternative to overpriced Cirque du Soleil this\nwinter. I must confess: while I am still\nskeptical about the dancing, I did end\nup thinking about joining the nearest\ncircus school. For half a day at least\u2026\nUntil March 14th\nI\nset off on Monday morning for\nthe Tate Triennial: \u2018Altermodern\u2019\nas if on an expedition to a remote\nplace. The Tate Triennial, only 4\nevents old, is another large-scale\nart event or \u2018mega-exhibition\u2019 like that\nof the Moscow Biennale, the Havana\nBiennial or the more well-established\nVenice Biennale to name just a few.\nSomehow \u2018global citizens\u2019 of the art\nworld manage to make their way to\nthese destinations but I cannot say\nthat I am one of them yet. However,\nthe Tate Triennial presented itself for\nparticipation and possible scrutiny and\nso I endeavoured (with excitement) to\nbe a part of it. For me all it really meant\nwas to pop up the road and over the\nriver (I live in Battersea), but I don\u2019t\nthink there is a single person in London who was not aware of the snow-laden weather on Monday and so for\nme, such a short trip meant gearing\nmyself up like a mountaineer to battle conditions our London streets are\nso unused to. When I arrived it was\nwith a sense of triumph therefore and\nof adventure.\nThe museum was quiet \u2013 a perfect\natmosphere for investigating artworks\nwith a complex thought process behind\nthem \u2013 although as I shall explain, this\nparticular event will probably be better suited to the hubbub of the general\npublic. Entering into the more classi-cally-designed \u2018white cube\u2019 space of the\nTate Britain, with its high ceilings and\nrooms punctuated with columns, the\narchitecture struck a dramatic contrast\nwith the modern (or should I say al-termodern) artworks, especially in the\nfirst room and the \u2018octagonal\u2019 room.\nA larger part of the Tate Britain\nhas been taken over by the Triennial,\nhosting the works of 28 artists (from\naround the globe). Stepping through\nthe entrance to the Triennial, we walk\nunder the words \u2018PA\u0141AC\u2019 in neon\npink, which in Polish means \u2018palace\u2019.\nThis particular introduction invites\nyou to imagine a fairytale castle, or\nperhaps the inside of a fun-house at a\nfair, which is more how it appealed to\nme. The artist\u2019s intention was to draw\nparallels between the neo-classical architecture of the galleries and the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw.\nThe first room had giant shapes in\nbold colours, like oversized baby\u2019s\nbuilding blocks and all along the walls\nwere Pascale Marthine Tayou\u2019s masks\nwith cartoon-like faces painted onto\nthem, intended as relics of the \u2018futurepast\u2019. Entering into the \u2018octagonal\u2019\nroom, we cowered beneath the giant\nmushroom cloud of silver pots and\npans of Subodh Gutpa\u2019s \u2018Line of Control\u2019, further adding to this element of\nthe fantastical, but also succeeding in\nmaking us feel like Lilliputians in this\ndramatic space.\nAltermodern as part of the globaliz-ing of art seems to be reaching more\ntowards that global scale in terms\nof the size of the artworks, for in the\nnext room we found a giant accor-dion, Rutha Ewan\u2019s \u2018Squeeze Jukebox\u2019\n\u2013 perfectly proportional and with glit-teringly glossy keys readily prepared\nfor \u2018assistants\u2019 to perform well-known\nmusical ditties on it at a point in the\nday (when the exhibition is open to the\npublic).\nNicolas Bourriaud is a French art\ncritic and curator, co-founder of the\nPalais de Tokyo in Paris and creator\nof \u2018altermodern\u2019 \u2013 the term and the\ncollective meaning of the exhibition.\nHe described the event as starting as\na \u201cdream catcher, a blank space\u201d onto\nwhich the artists could project change\nand \u2018alter\u2019 the meaning of art today.\nBourriaud suggests that modern art (or\npostmodern even) is \u2018dead\u2019 and today\u2019s\never-increasing global reach of art demands a new term and definition of\ncontemporary art and processes. The\ncollective effort is clearly important to\nthis triennial event whose main focus is\ntravel \u2013 the artists breaching space and\ntime to reach one another through the\nglobal space and creative dimensions.\nBourriaud insists that with the Altermodern show, \u201cartists can exchange\nat a planetary level for the first time\u201d,\nhowever this notion is somewhat con-testable, considering the focus of several large-scale art festivals the world-over have addressed segregation in the\nart world, as well as attempting to express a similar intent with the concep-tualisation of artworks.\nThe other artworks in the exhibition\nrange from stream of consciousness\namateur acting films to mechanical\nheads gormlessly yet musically communicating in harmonious grunts;\nliquid slides projected onto the walls\n\u2013 possibly invoking the club culture of\nacid past? It all appears carnivalesque\nto me \u2013 the bright colours and rotating panels of Franz Ackermann\u2019s urban\nprison-like space, the vibrating plates\non the floor translate Nathanial Mellor\u2019s brainwaves and even the video\n\u2018Giantbum\u2019 about some lost travellers\nwho find themselves inside the intestines of a giant recalls Rabelais\u2019 \u2018Gargantua & Pantagruel\u2019, a significant tale\nin literature of the carnivalesque.\nContrasted with this colourful and\nbizarre melee of \u2018altermodern\u2019 artistic\nexpression sounds the soft, controlled\nvoice of Nicolas Bourriaud who is possibly playing the puppet-master in this\nelaborate stage show. Bourriaud himself likens the Triennial to a theatrical\nperformance, describing the unfolding\nof events as a \u201clibretto\u201d.\nFor me the artworks are passionate\nand complex, but the meaning is not\nexpressly clear. The somewhat dry\ntheory and definition of \u2018altermodern\u2019\ndoes not correlate with a sense of the\n\u2018collective\u2019 \u2013 after all the artists each\nmade individual works and the artist\nhasworkedasanindividualthroughout\nhistory. Perhaps a few more collaborative works would have put this idea of\na collective across or even an attempt\nto make art for art\u2019s sake \u2013 the age-old\ndictum is one which seems to have\nbeen lost behind the \u2018modernisms\u2019 of\ntime. As I took my final cursory view\naround the exhibition space, I suddenly\nfelt an overwhelming sense of displace-ment. It did seem as if these artworks\nwere trying to take you somewhere \u2013\non a journey into the dark secrets of\nthe mind, but where that path leads is\nnot somewhere that one can trip down\neasily. Yet for a moment I wondered if\nthere might just be a chance that I am\n\u2018altermodern\u2019, too?\nUntil April 26th\n\u201cthe artworks are\npassionate and\ncomplex, but the\nmeaning is not\nexpressly clear\u201d\nAfter completing Final Fantasy XII for the fortieth time, Janice found herself with a lot of spare time\nBetween her daughter\u2019s pubescent theatrical gestures and occasional self-impalement, mumsy struggled to keep up with Adam\u2019s ADHD\n\n"

The article read that the\nDPEW and DPCS were nowhere to be seen when in fact the DPCS\nLily Topham was in the Student Activity Centre or in meetings for the\nwhole day.\nThe article should have read DPFS, as Christian Carter, who lives in\nSouthside, was nowhere to be seen.\nfelix apologises for the error made and giving out the wrong impression about the DPCS.\nNominations open\nWith five sabbatical positions open this year, Monday\u2019s opening\nof nominations marks the beginning of 2009\u2019s Union Elections\nThe yearly process of electing Union\nsabbatical positions is to commence,\nonce again, next week. The nomination window for Union Sabbatical and\nStudent Trustee positions opens on\nMonday the 16th of February. 2009\nwill be the first year that five sabbatical positions are to be filled. Previous\nyears have seen only four with Deputy\nPresident for Education and Welfare\nbeing split into two roles, Deputy President for (you guessed it) Education\nand Deputy President for (you guessed\nright again) Welfare.\nOther positions available for the next\nacademic year include Deputy President for Finances and Services, Deputy\nPresident for Clubs and Societies, Felix\nEditor and four Student Trustees. But\nif you feel like sitting on top of the pile,\nthe prestigious position of Imperial\nCollege Union President is also open\nto nomination. Elected Sabbaticals will\ntake a paid year out of their studies to\nbecome integral parts of the Union.\nAny current student of Imperial College can nominate themselves for any\nof these nine positions. If you\u2019re interested in running, simply log onto\nwww.union.ac.uk/vote and nominate\nyourself. Once confirmed as a nomi-nee, you will need 20 other current\nstudents to \u2018second\u2019. These may be your\nfriends or otherwise, but once you\nhave 20 \u2018seconds\u2019 from 20 people who\nthink you worthy of running, you can\nbe confirmed as a candidate for one of\nthe positions available.\nThe window for nominations lasts\nroughly two weeks and will close on\nSunday 1st March. Candidates then\nhave around two weeks to campaign\nacross campus, or as some previous candidates have chosen, not to.\nA campaign will involve producing a\nmanifesto by Friday the 6th of March,\nand attending official Union Hustings\nwithin the two weeks. Hustings are a\nchance for candidates to argue their\ncase why they\u2019d be ideal for the posi-tion, and hence why the student body\nshould vote for each of them. Hustings\nis also a chance for these voters to ask\nthe candidates the burning questions\nthat they may have.\nVoters can decide on their choices\nfrom the relevant candidate exposure\nthrough felix, Live! (cgcu.live.net), stoic\ntv and on-campus presence. On 13th of\nMarch, when candidate\u2019s faces will be\nfirmly stuck in our subconscious and\nour bellies full of free Haribo, the voting window opens. Five days are given,\nand every Imperial student should\nhave voted by 17th of March. Imperial\nCollege do not have to wait too long\nfor the results, and will be in marginal\nsuspense for only a day as results are\nannounced on the 18th of March.\nEarly indications show that many of\nthe nominees are looking to take the\nnatural step up from non-Sabattical\npositions this year within faculty unions such as RCSU and CGCU. Current CSC Chairs are also said to be\nconsidering running for positions.\nEarly nominee Charles Murdoch has\nbeen reported to be mulling over the\ndecision to run for all five sabbatical\npositions this year. College bookmakers give him early odds of winning\nany of these positions 1-799 and 1-11\nchance of being thrown out of College\nby the end of the year anyway.\nIf you want to stand for any of\nthe positions, nominations open on\nMonday, and felix will be guiding\nyou through each Sabbatical position next week.

The Union currently provides support in the running of over 300 different clubs with\nrecently added clubs including Balloon\nMaking.\nAccording to the Union over 12,000\nmemberships have been purchased\nthis year, already surpassing last year\u2019s\ntotal of 12,280. Yet these memberships are only held by just over half\nthe student population of Imperial,\nwhich begs the question, \u2018Why don\u2019t\nthe other half of Imperial want to be\na member of a club or society?\u2019 The\nsurvey looks to find the reasons for\nthis as well as collating more detailed\ninformation about the opinions of\ncurrent club members and also club\nofficers.\nThe results will help the Union improve the services offered to the clubs\nand their members as well as highlighting areas where non-members can be\nencouraged to get involved.\nYou can take part in the survey by\ngoing to www.imperialcollegeunion.\norg/survey. Two randomly selected\npeople who complete the survey will\nwin an iPod Nano!\nHenry T. Bovey [1908-1910]\nThe first rector of Imperial College was unsure\nwhether or not to take office given his deteriorating health. Upon accepting his appointment\nin 1908 the severity of the situation led to his\nresignation.\nHe was educated at Cambridge where he became a talented structural engineer. His prominence led him to become the Chair of Engineering at McGill University in Canada. He was\nremembered for his incredible vision.\nSir Alfred Keogh [1910-1922]\nKeogh studied at Queen\u2019s College Galway. As a\nsurgeon, he became appointed Director General\nof the Army Medical Service until taking office at\nImperial College.\nGiven his progressive views on the role of women in academia, he was instrumental in creating a\nwomen\u2019s association for students and staff at Imperial College.\nIn 1967 one of the College\u2019s residence halls was\nnamed after him.\nSir Thomas H. Holland [1922-1929]\nSir Thomas Holland was awarded a Scholarship to study at the Royal College of Science,\nnow a constituent of Imperial College, where\nhe graduated from with a degree in Geology.\nHe was a great driving force behind the association of Imperial College with the University\nof London.\nThe Staff and postgraduate bar on Campus,\nThe Holland Club, remains as a tribute to his\nmemory.\nSir Henry T. Tizard [1929-1942]\nTizard became Rector of Imperial in 1929 and was\ninfluential in shaping the College of today. He recognised the need for expansion purchasing land at\nHarlington for use as a sports ground and helped\nsecure Silwood Park as the College\u2019s field station.\nHe was also instrumental in creating today\u2019s South\nKensington Campus. Outspoken and warm with a\ncaustic wit, he is remembered for spending nights\nat the College during the war, playing snooker and\nbilliards, and chatting to members of staff.\nSir Richard Southwell [1942-1948]\nIn 1942 he joined Imperial College as Rector, retiring in 1948. Whilst at Imperial he continued\nhis research interests in the Engineering sci-ences, but also gave time to students. Given his\ndedication it was only natural that Selkirk Hall, a\nnew student residence was named after him.\nSir Roderic M. Hill [1948-1954]\nAir Chief Marshall Sir Roderic Hill Rector of Imperial in 1948 upon his retirement from the RAF and\ngave great consideration to the sciences of which\nhe knew little.\nCharming and energetic, he saw the need for\nstudents to gain a rounded education, introducing the music recitals and arts lectures still held at\nlunch times at South Kensington Campus. Hill was\nappointed to a post his father had also held, Vice\nChancellor of London University, in 1953.\nSir Patrick Linstead [1954-1966]\nDuring Linstead\u2019s tenure much of the campus\nwas rebuilt and in the early 1960s, the Empire\nwas giving way to the new Commonwealth.\nThis caused him to consider changing Imperial\u2019s name, but was implored not to by former\nstudents. He foresaw Imperial\u2019s eventual departure from the University of London in July 2007,\nwriting that Imperial\u2019s \u2018importance in the educational scene is not reflected in the practices and\nprocedures of the university\u2019.\nThe Rt Hon. Lord Flowers [1973-1985]\nAppointed in 1973 Flowers held the post until 1985.\nHe was a founder member of the Social Democratic Party. Two halls of residence at Silwood Park\nCampus have been named after him and his wife,\nMary, who played a great part in maintaining the\nvery close relationship that the Flowers had with\nstudents and staff during their time at the College.\nThe year 2000 saw the opening of a multidisciplinary life sciences research facility named the Flowers Building.\nSir Eric A. Ash [1985-1993]\nSir Eric Ash came to Britain to escape Nazi Germany in 1938 and came to study at Imperial College. Ash became Rector of Imperial in 1985,\nretiring in 1993. One of the legacies of his time\nwas the expansion of Imperial into the realm of\nmedicine with the merger of St Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School with the College in 1988. He\nfelt that bringing in medical students was also a\nway of raising the number of women students,\nsomething he felt was very necessary.\nThe Lord Oxburgh [1993-2000]\nHe created the Imperial College School of Medicine\nthrough mergers with the National Heart and Lung\nInstitute (1995), the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School and the Royal Postgraduate\nMedical School (1997) and the Kennedy Institute\nof Rheumatology (2000). He was made a life peer\nin 1999 as Lord Oxburgh of Liverpool and is active\nin the House of Lords on Science issues as Chairman of the Select Committee on Science.\nSir Richard Sykes [2001-2008]\nSir Richard Sykes was Rector of Imperial College London from January 2001 to June\n2008. Many saw him as a businessman, streamlining a lot of the management services\nin Imperial, which included abolishing the old City and Guilds College and Royal College of Science to create a Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, much to the annoyance of prior students.\nHowever the business attitude did have its advantages as Imperial rose to 5th in the\nWorld as well as ensuring that the College was financially secure for years to come.\nOne of the biggest shortcomings of his time however, was the falling student satisfaction level, something that many believe is the reason for Imperial not performing\nbetter.\nSir Owen Saunders [1966-1967]\nSaunders joined Imperial as Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1932. Saunders\nwas the Dean of the City and Guilds College and\nPro Rector between 1964\u201366.\nHe became Acting Rector following the sudden\ndeath of Sir Patrick Linstead in 1966. He went on to\nbecome Vice Chancellor of the University of London in 1967.\nThe Rt Hon. Lord Penney [1967-1973]\nAlthough Penney was a successful leader, he\nfelt this was a difficult time for university admin-istration. He did not leave any personal papers,\ndeciding to burn his collection shortly before he\ndied. Once finished at Imperial, Penney worked\non the development of the combined Allied and\nBritish atomic bombs. He continued to work in\nthe nuclear industry after the war and became\na board member of the newly formed United\nKingdom Atomic Energy Authority.\nTURN OVER TO\nMEET THE NEWEST\nRECTOR\n\n"

Three of\nthe things that your\nnew girlfriend will\nbe interested in. But\nyou weigh up your\noptions... free sex with a proper mental girl,\nor a fat wank? The option of a real life girl just\nedges ahead. I suggest you keep your bum hole\nplugged with a cork from a wine bottle. You\ncan never be too careful.\nAquarius\nNew and improved?\nSeriously what the\nfuck? How can\nsomething be both\nnew and improved?\nIf it\u2019s new it is based\nupon unused technology. So if it is improved\nthen it is simply an update. If I said I had a new\nmethod of having sex\u2013 i.e. using a condom \u2013\nwould you be impressed? Surely that\u2019s just an\nimprovement. I ramble. Fuck you all.\nDoing this after ACC Bar\nNight so I couldn\u2019t care all that\nmuch. Basically I am hiding\ndown in felix as people want\nto kill me. It\u2019s not my fault\nguys! Beer would have been\non much longer but certain\nclubs decided to have a fight.\nAnyhoo back to the matter\nat hand... awww fuck it. I just\nwant to have a pint and sleep.\nSomeone won. Well done.\nI\nt has been a long time since we\nhad a good long catch up. Seriously, it has been a while. Do you\nremember those times when you\nsat in your sofa next to a blazing natural fire, curled up with a large\nmug of hot chocolate in one hand, and\nfelix in the other? Yeah those were\ngood times. We would have a nice little\nmonologue, me and you... well just you\n(this is all pre-written). I would tell you\nall about things that happened in the\nlast week, what was coming up next\nweek, and pick out the best bits from\nthis week\u2019s issue. Good times. Those\nwere happy days. Remember Sikh MC?\nNo, well that will be because he never\nturned up (to my disappointment). Ah\nwell, better to carry on not crying. So\ntaking back the usual tradition I will\nstart off by saying the FUCWIT league\nis still, as ever, dominated by the usual\n2 teams, but the struggle for 3rd place\nis becoming more and more fierce.\nAlso notice that the league has been\ndivided into 2 sections. One for teams,\nand one for individuals. We thought it\nwould be fairer to all the contestants\ninvolved. Chaz really enjoys making\nthe puzzles each week, and it makes\nhim happy so many people participate.\nSo he made another one. It is called\nRavi Pall\nCoffee Break Editor\nmentalist maze, and the quickest submission will get 5 points.\nIn this issue of felix there is a nice\nfeature on the college\u2019s previous rec-tors. It\u2019s well worth a read. As ever the\ncomments section is a great source of\namusement, expect for Imperial Girl. I\nwish she would curl over in a ditch and\ndie. She is so annoying and if anything\nangers every one of my female friends\ngreatly. She is so arrogant to think she\nis the correct representation of female\nstudents at IC. grrrr\nAnother thing brought to my attention is that the student nightlife at the\nunion has increased considerably. This\nterm has been a lot of fun with lots of\nevents going on. Also the American\nstudents from our affiliate universities\nhelp make the atmosphere more in-teresting. For example the superbowl\nnight was so much fun. Not because of\nthe game \u2013 NFL isn\u2019t my cup of tea \u2013\nbut because of the mass snowball fight\nthat engulfed Prince Consort road.\nI can\u2019t wait for RAG week to start. I\nheard there is laser tag in the Quad on\nWednesday evening, during the RAG\nRaid after party. AWESOME!!!\nOnly thing left so say is keep collecting the top trump cards, and at some\npoint I\u2019ll make the backs for you.\nCatch-up\nTop Trumps\nCut them out!\nHighest score\nwins\nCollect them all!\nWatch this\nspace for\nadditional cards\nBattles of the Charles\nL A T N I S M O H U L S O\nI N S U B O R D I N A T E\nG T A N P U E D V W A E D\nM E R C I F U L O I D E S\nT R E S F A Y C N I R N\nU N G O D L Y U I D E A L\nR O C K E E E C H I S G L\nS W O O N N P R O B L E M\nB A E N T S E I S E W E R\nA D Z E W T O N A L I T Y\nT A I W E O G K E U K A N\nG Y N A E C O L O I S T\nC S E Y T K A E S A N K L\nI\nG\nScribble box\nKnown from:\nMusic\nBiggest Achievement:\nHit singles after signing with Atlantic\nrecords.

And the weekend\nafter that. Easter holiday?\nRevision. Hang out with\nmates. Perhaps canoeing somewhere in Devon, but nothing\nmore adventurous than that.\nOr so they think.\nReckon you are off the hook once the\nsurgeon had snipped off the umbilical\ncord? Wrong. Be prepared to spend\nyour childhood under parental dicta-torship, and young-adult days fabricating lies in order to sneak off travelling.\nOr at least that is how I would sum up\nmy life.\nAnd I am fed up. The lies. The escapades under their noses. The gazillion\n\u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t go there\u201d that\ndrives me insane. I still love you, mum\nand dad, but make me stay in bubble\nwrap for the rest of my life? Shoot me\nnow.\nBut I am not alone. We are all embroiled in this public obsession with\nthe concept of \u2018health and safety\u2019.\nI guess I can applaud its merits in\nkeeping most of us alive and intact. But\nthe repetitive safety briefings designed\nfor ten-year-olds? Tedious risk assess-ments? I cannot help but wonder if our\nsociety has become overprotective, if\nnot squeamish.\nAs for us, are we really so immature and incapable of looking after\nourselves that we need rigid safety\nguidelines to keep us in check? Piss on\nyou, bureaucracy, for questioning our\nmaturity.\nAnd so is the environment we are\nborn unto. Our folks, infected with\nthis \u2018social disorder\u2019, would have spent\nhours lecturing us on hazard after haz-ard. That is if they let us venture into\nthe great unknown in the first place.\nWith the backdrop of teenage alcoholism and gang culture, no wonder\nparents are too afraid to release their\nkids into the wild. Fair enough. Yet they\nare nurturing a generation of spoiled\nweaklings or, worse still, frustrated\nteens turning to alcohol and drugs as\nmeans of escapism.\nWhat modern parents tend to forget\nis that growing up is about the exposure to danger, and the experience one\ngains from it. Allowing a child to burn\nhimself, sadistically speaking, is a more\neffective way to caution him of the perils of playing with fire than to tell him\nso.\nYet parents do have a reason to fear.\nIncidents resulting in deaths and injuries are, one might argue, miniscule\nrepresentations of the bigger picture\n\u2013 they still happened. For that reason\nparents have an obligation to worry.\nAnd quite rightfully so.\nThere are obviously exceptions.\nThere wouldn\u2019t be an upsurge in the\n\u2018gap-year culture\u2019 if every parent sought\nto imprison his/her children within the\nlimits of their homes.\nIgnore my rant if it doesn\u2019t apply to\nyou. But for those whose parents would\nphysically restrain you from a bungee,\nor check you into a mental asylum for\never mentioning \u201cgap year\u201d, a word of\nadvice: confront them, tell them why it\nis time to let go.\nAs for me, I shall perform the John\nDarwin-style disappearing act \u2013 canoeing somewhere in Devon this Easter.\nOr so they think.\nKeila-Joa\nWaterfall, Estonia\nScribble your name and that of a crush\nonto a padlock, fasten it onto the\nbridge and toss the key into the icy river below. He/she is now yours forever.\nAllegedly.\nNo luck with the ladies? Guys not answering your calls? Forget the love potions. Here are the world\u2019s\nanswers to all things singleton.\nBeating the Valentine\u2019s Day Blues\nB\nefore I start, I would like\nto pay tribute to the two\nAustralian lads who died\na month ago on the neighbouring Fox Glacier. They\nwent over the safety line, sure; but did\nthey deserve the tonne of ice that came\ncrumbling down and so prematurely\nended their lives? I don\u2019t think so.\nI appreciate that not everyone can\nfind anything spectacular or glorious\nabout glacier hikes. A colossal lump of\nice suspended in a valley is, after all, a\nlump of ice. Shamefully, I once thought\nthat too. Then, a few lectures on glaciation sprouted a burning desire to go\nsee the real thing for myself.\nThe Franz Josef Glacier offered a\nsolution. Located on the West coast\nof New Zealand\u2019s South Island, it was\nfirst scaled by Europeans in 1865. The\nAustrian explorer Julius Haast paid\ntribute to the Austrian emperor by\nnaming the glacier after him. Alternatively, call it by its Maori name: Ka\nRoimata o Hine Hukatere (Tears of the\nAvalanche Girl). The glacier is known\nas one of the most fast-moving of its\nkind, estimated to shift 7 cm per day.\nAnd it is advancing.\nIts sheer size is reflected upon its associate village, which is simplistic and\ntoo miniature for a tourist hot spot.\nStanding outside the Franz Josef Glacier Guides HQ, after a sleepless night\nin the local YHA infested with rowdy\ntourists, my jaws dropped not to yawn\nbut in surrender to awe. This is no\nlonger a lump of ice, but nature\u2019s fury\ncharging down the mountains over\ngeological timescales.\nGeared up, the entourage of hikers\narrived at the glacier\u2019s terminal face by\ncoach. Growing confident on my fitness level, I joined the fast group and\nKat the guide, a compatriot from Cumbria with a degree in geography. Crampons on and off we ascended.\nAnd what an ascent it was. Although not as physically demanding\nas I had expected (I wasn\u2019t gasping for\na change), the labyrinth of icy tunnels\nand crevasses and ridges was a consistent challenge and did not disappoint.\nWith Kat hacking away the ice to make\npassage in regular intervals, rest was\naplenty; seizing the opportunity cameras snapped and eyes gleamed against\nthe scenery, before we proceeded to\ntrample over freshly-carved stairwells.\nAfter a debate over the futility of\nheli-hiking (what\u2019s the point hovering\nover the glacier?), several Christmas\ncarols (it was Christmas Eve) and the\ncheesy photos at the highest point of\nthe hike, we descended. Being the fast\ntrack, this section was flat and lacklus-tre. But being a scramble than a trek,\nwe resembled the Fellowship fleeing\nfrom the Misty Mountains, the enemy\nbeing an increasingly grumpy stomach\nrather than a horde of orcs.\nFor NZ$140 (\u00a350) the full-day tour\nguarantees six hours on the ice \u2013 I enjoyed every second of it. My only moan\nwas the treacherous 2 km walk across\na dried-up riverbed leading to our\nawaiting transport. It gave me cramps.\nOnly if I had kept my geologist\u2019s hat on,\nwaltzed among the pebbles gathering\nsamples and proclaiming Christmas\nhad come a day early, would I quit wh-inging. But no, I was too out of breath\nfor that.\nDylan Lowe braved the cold to climb the ice.

Well, it won\u2019t reach us for another epoch\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood\nFood Editors \u2013 Afonso Campos & Rosie Grayburn\nAfonso Campos\nFood Editor\nThe Titans outeat\nthe Teletubbies\npork sandwhiches and buffalo chicken\nwings. I am not usually attracted to\nthis genre of food, but Bodean\u2019s has\nthis incredible pull on me. It definitely\nmakes my chest hair darker just at the\nthought. It\u2019s quite brilliant.\nA nine person group is hard to seat\nin a space as small as Bodean\u2019s and as a\nresult, we were split into two different\nback-to-back booths. Four on one table\nand five on the other. Along with other\nfelix writers, I was in the four person\ntable, and what a table it was going to\nbecome throughout the evening.\nThe waiter managed to mess up all\nour orders and apologetically brought\neach of us an extra half chicken on top\nof sausages, spare ribs, pulled pork,\ncoleslaw and a mountain of french\nfries. At this moment, the war began.\nWe saw the extra food as a calling,\nembraced our manhood and decided\nto outeat the five person table. Our\nfriends now became our opponents.\nWe were no longer a bunch of felix\nwriters, but a group with the common\ngoal to test the extent of our shared\ntestosterone content.\nWe became the Titans, and our\nweakling adversaries became the Teletubbies. Even if you never have never\nread any Greek mythology or fried\nyour brain with mindless, infantile tel-evision, you know how easily a Titan\ncould trump a Teletubby. And we did.\nWe came. We saw. We ate. And then\nwe ate some more. By the end of the\nevening, we were beating our chests\ntriumphantly and screaming loudly on\nthe streets of Fulham. Our oponents\nwalked home dejected, lost.\nI\nt started abruptly and without\nany consideration for St Augustine\u2019s theological principle\nof just war. There was no warning and certainly none of the jus\nad bellum criteria for the beginning of\nany war were met. The war was unprecedented in proportion. My helpless oponents could barely trust their\nvision when the proverbial hammerheads and spears commenced flying\npast them, shutting their hearts with a\nfear that would scare even the bravest\nof souls.\nI take it all of this means very little to\nyou, and am even less certain that you\nare familiar with the theory of war of\nthe 1600s. Let\u2019s put things into context.\nI am a male and like the typical male at\nImperial, my closest friends also share\nthis problematic chromosome issue.\nAs such, we have this inexplicable desire to prove to all XY\u2019s that we are the\ntypical alpha males. The easiest way to\nfuel this desire is obviously to outeat\nanyone in sight.\nAfter a lengthy discussion with a\ngroup of friends as to where to have\ndinner, we succumbed to Bodean\u2019s.\nWhen I say succumbed, I actually\nmean we were drawn to the place like it\nwas a humongous magnet. If you live\nanywhere close to SW6, you will have\nat the very least heard of it. Were there\na typically american smoke house in\nHeaven, Bodean\u2019s would be it. It is like\nthe angels felt pity for us mere mortals\nand decided to prize us with their most\nvaluable posession... in Fulham.\nOne might find it weird that I should\nbe so excited about spare ribs, pulled\nVapiano in the arpeggios\nevery sense of the word. Spread over\nthe Middle East, the United States and\nEurope, it\u2019s a German take on an Italian bar.\nI arrived expecting another version of\nPizza Express, so I was pretty confused\nwhen I got handed my very own Vapiano \u2018credit card\u2019. The concept is easy\nonce you get the hang of it: you browse\nthe counters, order and scan your card\non a black box, carry the food to your\ntable, eat, drink, hand the card back at\nthe exit and pay with your real credit\ncard. It\u2019s really an upscale canteen with\na twist. When you order pizza, you get\na buzzer which goes off when ready.\nNow it may sound strange to hear that\nthere is plenty of staff when you are\nthe one who has to order the food and\ncarry your drinks; but that\u2019s the point\nof the place, the emphasis on interac-tivity. If you\u2019re scouting for a romantic\nrestaurant to share an intimate chat,\nthis probably isn\u2019t the best place. However, if you want a lively spot where\nthere will be plenty to discuss about on\na first date, this isn\u2019t a bad idea.\nYou mainly get to chose from different groups of pastas and pizzas,\nthough there is a salad and antipasto\nVapiano HHHKK\n19-21 Great Portland St, W1\n020 7268 0080\nBest: The environment; 10% off\nfor students\nWorst: Not exactly the best of\nfood for the\nPrice: \u00a320/25 per head\nbar. Prices range from \u00a35.50-8.50. If\nyou\u2019re special about you\u2019re food, you\nmay like the fact that you can specify\nwhich ingredients you want, and how\nmuch of them go into your food: spelt\nor normal pasta? more or less salt? you\nget the idea. We got the antipasti and\nsalad to share. The plate was large\nand varied, with pickled aubergines,\nparmesan, mozzarella and a range of\ncured meats. They were all acceptable,\nbut an easy fix whose quality wasn\u2019t\nnotable. The pasta we ordered was a\ndisappointment. It was cooked according to timers, but the staff should\ntake the time to adjust them, because\nthey were far from being al dente and\nwere frankly quite stodgy. The sauces\nwere ok, the arrabiata was spicy, but\nnot out of this world. Dessert was bet-ter, but then again a decent Tiramisu\nat an Italian restaurant is a must. At\nleast their selection of wines redeemed\nthe food, and my glasses of Valpolicella\ndiluted my initial dissatisfaction with\nthe place.\nVapiano is not for the likes of\neverybody, it is not a culinary\nexperience, but it does put an original\nand fun spin on dining.\nJust off Oxford Circus, where MASH\nused to be, is Vapiano. It means \u2018going softly\u2019 in Italian, which is a bit odd,\nbecause it actually is a fast-food res-taurant. Despite being a lively place,\nspread over two floors, the d\u00e9cor lacks\noriginality: it looks like its come out of\nan IKEA catalogue. A mix of pale colours and red give off warm vibes, and\nthe seating caters for different moods:\nhigh stools or loungy sofas. Lining the\nback is a glass enclosed space where\nyou can watch the staff prepare your\nfood. You can\u2019t reserve (unless it\u2019s for\nparty get-together), but given the vast\nsurface area, there really isn\u2019t a need\nto.

Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nWhat do we really want from the\nopposite sex?\nW\nith Valentine\u2019s day\ntomorrow, Every\nNation Christian\nSociety Last Night\nran an event called\n\u201cUnderstanding the Opposite sex\u201d.\nWhy would a Christian society be doing this?\nWell, we like to think that if Jesus\nwere here, he\u2019d sit you down like a good\nolder brother and tell you all about the\nbirds, bees and explain those weird humans out there who look like you with\nfunny bits attached.\nA big part of the push for this event\nwas a survey, which you might have\nbeen accosted with in the past week.\nThe aim was to survey 50 men and 50\nwomen, we ended up with around 70\nof each sex. Said survey had the below\nquestions, the answers of which at the\ntime of writing, were to be used in a\ngame show at the event last night. And\nhere are the answers, your guide to\nwhat the opposite sex thinks. (\u201cWhat\ndid Christians ever do for us?\u201d I hear\nyou ask?, THIS!) Read on, you might\nlearn something.\nInterestingly enough, 5% of men surveyed said that love was the most important element in a relationship, while\nthe closest women came to that was\nFriendship, with a negligible amount\nsuggesting love.\nA quick look at the answers that one\nsex gave but the other didn\u2019t, shows\nJealousy, Betrayal, and \u201cA Third Person\u201d among women\u2019s answers. Some\nsay at least three of these are just different ways of saying cheating, some\nmen say it makes it seem like women\nare slightly paranoid, but perhaps that\u2019s\njust their prior experience talking.\nThe men\u2019s answers included differing expectations, selfishness, inability\nto compromise and lack of sex. Making it sound like men are scared that\nthe woman won\u2019t want to do what they\nwant to. Who knows where they get\nthese ideas? Might be experience all\nover again.\nOne of the questions on the \u201cUnderstanding the Opposite sex\u201d posters was\n\u201cIs it even possible?\u201d. To which many\nanswered an emphatic \u201cNo!\u201d. Someone\neven grafittied on one of the posters to\nthat effect (thanks for the feedback).\nAnd aside from knowing (or not)\nwhat the other sex thinks, it appears\nthat both Men and Women agree\nlargely on what it takes to build a rela-tionship. So the question remains, why\nis there still this belief, based on ex-perience, that getting on with the opposite sex in close quarters is so hard?\nPerhaps knowing and doing are two\ndifferent things.\nPerhaps Jesus, in older brother mode,\nwould have something to say to move\nus from knowing to being able to do.\nAnd ultimately, that\u2019s what last night\nwas trying to find out.\nMore on that next week. In the\nmeantime, you\u2019ve got your map to\nwhat the object of your affections\nmight be thinking. May it come in useful tomorrow.\nEvery Nation Christian look into what the students of Imperial think about relationships and the opposite\nsex. Tosin Ajayi leads us through the weird and wonderful answers the students had to give\nNote: If an answer was given by only one person, it is not included,\nalthough ones that tickled us do get special mentions.\nWhile some might say that the prevalence of looks was to be expected, Personality seems equally important (either that or you men lied) and while some may\nargue that Boobs, Face, Ass, Hair, Eyes etc. come under looks, they were each said\nwith enough specificity (it\u2019s a word, I looked it up) to warrant separate mentions.\nSpecial Mentions go to : \u201cNo Man bits\u201d & \u201cAbility to get legs behind head\u201d\nMen, it\u2019s official. If you\u2019re funny, you\u2019re in there. Dust off that old book of one-liner chat up lines. Romance, the age-old forerunner, might be truly dead, or at\nleast gasping on a respirator somewhere.\nSpecial Mention goes to: Big nose\n\u201cShe take my Money! Now I\u2019m in need\u201d seems to sum up a lot of men\u2019s feelings\nabout what women are after. Hats off to the prophet that is Kanye West, speaking\nfor 17% of men everywhere. Besides that, below the seemingly superficial surface,\nit appears that there might be enough men at Imperial who actually know what it\nis Imperial women are looking for.\nSpecial mention goes to: \u201cSomeone with Handcuffs\u201d\nLadies and gentlemen, we have a winner! Women apparently think men are shal-low. And a quick glance back to question 1 shows ... oh, they\u2019re right.\nSpecial mention goes to: Someone just as messed up as they are\nHere, there was a startling similarity between men and women, with the top three\nanswers being the same for both sexes.

Christmas and New Year are over,\nand there\u2019s a lot of work to do in this\nlong spring term. It\u2019s normal to sometimes feel down-hearted under these\ncircumstances. And it\u2019s understandable not to want to get out of bed some\nmornings! (Recognise yourself here?)\nMost people feel like this from time\nto time. However, if you\u2019ve been feeling miserable for several weeks, if you\ndon\u2019t seem to be able to enjoy anything\nand have lost interest in your course\nand your social life, and if this feeling\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be shifting, it\u2019s possible that you might be depressed. Depression is common within the student\npopulation, as it is within the population in general. And it\u2019s possible \u2013 and\nimportant \u2013 to do something about it.\nSome more questions. Are you eating much less or much more than usu-al? Do you feel tired for much of the\ntime? Are you having difficulty getting\noff to sleep, or do you wake up several\ntimes during the night, or unusually\nearly, feeling tired and worrying? Are\nyou having difficulty concentrating in\nlectures, or when you\u2019re studying? Are\nyou wanting to avoid contact with your\nfriends? Are you feeling particularly\ncritical of yourself? Is it a struggle to\nactually think, to work out what you\nhave to do, or to make decisions?\nIf you\u2019re experiencing some of these\ndifficulties, it\u2019s important to talk to\nsomeone about it: depression can be a\ndownward spiral involving \u2013 for some\n\u2013 feeling that it\u2019s not worth carrying on\nwith the course, or indeed with your\nlife. Clearly, it\u2019s vital to interrupt this\npattern. Although the last thing you\nmight want to do is to talk to someone\nabout how you\u2019re feeling, it\u2019s important that you do. You might be imagining that you\u2019re the only person in the\nworld feeling like this, and not coping,\nbut there are certainly other students\naround who will be feeling the same\nway, yet not wanting to let anyone\nknow about it. College might not seem\nto be a place where it feels OK to admit\nto not coping.\nIt\u2019s useful to consider the broader\ncontext in order to understand some\npeople\u2019s experience of depression. Life\nfor some students has become significantly more stressful over the past few\nyears; you might have to work to support yourself through College and the\ncost of accommodation is high. This is\nthe context within which you have to\nnavigate the demanding workload. Are\nyou feeling disappointed that your experience at College isn\u2019t turning out to\nbe what you had hoped for and expect-ed? Are you feeling homesick? Perhaps\nyou\u2019re a long way from home which\nmight be in a different country. If\nyou\u2019re a mature student, are you having\nto juggle the responsibilities of childcare and domestic tasks along with\nthe academic challenge of returning\nto education after a period in employ-ment? If you\u2019re slipping behind with\ncourse work and missing an increasing number of lectures, it\u2019s important\nto acknowledge this. Don\u2019t bury your\nhead in the sand. Talk to your personal\ntutor, senior tutor, postgraduate tu-tor, or someone else you feel you can\napproach in your department. If you\nhave slipped a long way behind, talk to\nsomeone anyway so that you can work\nout a course of action to attend to your\nsituation.\nWho else can you contact if you\u2019re\nfeeling low? You could talk with a counsellor in the College\u2019s Student Counselling Service, or with a doctor or practice nurse in Imperial College Health\nCentre. There are also counsellors and\npsychotherapists in the Health Centre\nwho can be consulted after referral via\na doctor or practice nurse.\nInformation about the Student\nCounselling Service is at: www.impe-rial.ac.uk/counselling.

Unfortunately we still see\na number of thefts from the campus.\nThe bikes that have been stolen are often those that haven\u2019t been locked up,\nones with insufficient bike locks and\nthose parked in insecure areas.\nWhen it comes to buying bike locks\nthere are many different products on\nthe market and price is not necessarily\na reliable indicator of quality.

Check\nout www.soldsecure.com for certified\nlocks, or ask your local bike shop for\na recommendation. Check the packaging for more information.\n* Invest in a quality lock.

Another simple plot \u2013 a young girl needs an\nabortion in 1987 communist Romania\nwhere it is strongly prohibited, so she\ngets one illegally. I struggled to contain 4 3 2 inside my head, I couldn\u2019t,\nit carved its way into my heart. This\none hurts, you are gonna feel it. From\nstart to finish this film gives no respite.\nIt lulls you in with what feels like the\nmost tedious half-hour of your life, you\nreally begin to notice that this bore has\nno soundtrack whatsoever. Whilst the\ntasks being performed by Otilia (An-amaria Marinca) for her friend Gabita\n(Laura Vasiliu) are meager, buying cig-arettes, booking a hotel room, something dark lurks beneath these apparently meaningless labours. In the 25th\nminute Otillia meets Domnu\u2019 Bebe\n(Vlad Ivanov), a back-street abortionist with a penchant for psychological\ntorture. To be frank, he scares the living shit out of me; his presence hangs\nover the girls, a leering devil. It\u2019s at\nthis point that 4 3 2 begins to pin you\nto the ground and unsheathes its ice-cold knife. As the film progresses and\nGabita nears her abortion, the weight\non your chest grows heavier and no\nmatter how much you wriggle and\nsquirm it begins to cut your flesh. Pick\na level of misandry, it\u2019s here. From the\ntrivial but annoying \u201cmy boyfriend just\ndoesn\u2019t understand\u201d, to the significantly\nmore agonising \u201cso you don\u2019t have all\nthe money, eh, well you\u2019ll just have to\nsweeten the deal\u201d, this movie delivers\nlashings of man-hate. Writer/director\nCristian Mungiu has excelled, the camera shots are simple and slow, adding\nto the feeling of an invisible observer.\nThroughout the movie Otillia stands\ntall, her sacrifices for Gabita are end-less, although a touch of disgust begins\nto curl her upper-lip towards the end\nof the ordeal. Otillia is a rock who resists the ocean but is still scarred by\ntime, Bebe\u2019s evil has tainted her. This\nis a powerful production, but I can\u2019t\nsay I\u2019d watch it again, I\u2019m too much of\na coward.\nSo there\u2019s your choice of fuck-ups,\ngood luck, and don\u2019t let them ruin your\nsex life.\nNote from Editor: I realise that reviews of both these movies were printed in the film section last year, but once\nagain I couldn\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 to printing\nsomething written by Bad Taste \u2013 he\nactually responded to my appeal and I\nhope you join me in saying \u2018kudos\u2019 to\nyou Bad Taste. Now tell us your name.\nFor the Lovers and Haters of Valentine\u2019s Day\nI\nt is that time of the year once\nagain: the day where greeting\ncard companies churn out thousands of different cards which\nsay everything you wish to say to\npeople you love and people that don\u2019t\nhave any love (yes \u2013 you can get Valentine\u2019s cards for single people now).\nValentine\u2019s Day divides people into two\ncategories: Lovers and Haters, splitting\nStefan Carpanu\nThere\u2019s something undeniably likeable in the quirkiness of The Wackness, something which has eluded\nmany teen-related, (romantic) comedies of late. What makes it even\nmore extraordinary is that although\nsome drugs change hands, it\u2019s not a\nfilm that you can only watch if you\u2019re\nhigh and weirdly enough it goes beyond showcasing private parts in order to be amusing.\nFact is, the comedy genre is a\ntough genre. It\u2019s perhaps more merciless than drama or action, for a bad\ncomedy is nothing but a bad com-edy, while bad drama or action films\ntend to be inherently funny. So how\nis it that The Wackness didn\u2019t pop\nup on many radars last year and this\ncharming, if a tad familiar story, lies\nmostly unseen and unheard of? This\nis even more surprising considering\nthat it boasts a fairly familiar cast, including Ben Kingsley, Famke Janssen,\nMary-Kate Olsen, Olivia Thirlby and\nthe unrecognisable (ex) child-star\nJosh Peck.\nLabelled as a coming-of-age story,\nthe film is centred around Luke Shapiro and something like a summer of\nlove \u2013 with less girl-on-girl action,\nand a lot of old-school hip-hop. Luke\nThe Wackness HHHHK\nDirector: Jonathan Levine\nWriter: Jonathan Levine\nCast: Josh Peck,\n\tBen Kingsley,\n\tOlivia Thirlby The human penis is bigger, in proportion to body size and in absolute terms,\nthan any other primate. Humanity has\na sex obsession. But there is a price to\npay for pleasure, sexual dysfunction is\nrife, sex is laced with power and abuse.\nHere are two films about slightly unu-sual, but very real, sexual dilemmas.\nParamount Vantage presents our\nfurioso Black Snake Moan (2008).\nLet\u2019s start with the drawbacks. This\nfilm lacks a little in the scripting, and\nthe plot isn\u2019t exactly complex: Deep\nSouthern, traumatised, skinny, white\ngirl fucks too much, to whom big ol\u2019\nblack man teaches error of ways. Not\nto be taken seriously, this feature lacks\ndepth; it strains for a gravity it doesn\u2019t\nunderstand. Particularly undermined\nby its stereotyping, hypocrisy and sym-bolism, the tale is dispossessed of real-ity, leaving it cold to the touch. But this\nfilm ain\u2019t for the head, stop thinking,\njust live it. Coil up around the killer\nsoundtrack, to just wander and roam\nover the vibrancy of the picture. Black\nSnake Moan is brought to life by some\nsuperb acting, first and foremost from\nour broken protagonist.\nSlim right down, eat only food of no\nnutritional value throughout the production and live a little as Rae (Chris-tina Ricci). Be the sultry eyes and the\njutting jaw that echo the obstinacy of\na Bible Belt upbringing. You just ain\u2019t\nright gal. Child abuse has lead to nym-phomania, bouts of Satre-esk nausea\ncouple body to a foiled control ad-diction. Rip yourself so that no man\ncan break you, welcome to Rae. After\na wholesome night of drugs and de-bauchery, Rae is finally beat up and\ndumped on the roadside. Enter the\naptly named Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), a lost ex-bluesman whose wife\naborted his child and left him for his\nbrother. Laz scrapes up the road-kill\nand takes her home to mend up.\nUpon finding out whom and what\nRae is, he implements the classic combo\u2019 of tough love and the chaining to a\ncast-iron radiator. But ignore the sto-ryline, Jackson is in the zone. He holds\nLazarus together, picking through his\ncharacter\u2019s flaws to find a dark seam of\ncool; the man is strong and bold, tempered by a god-fearing humility. Overall the acting in this movie is fantastic;\nwe even see a passable performance\nby Justin Timberlake as Ronnie, Rae\u2019s\nlongstanding boyfriend. Although this,\nI fear, is down to Ronnie being a pitiful snivel of a character, something our\n\u201cCry me a River\u201d star can relate to.\nSo take this one as it comes, a shallow teenage pout of a film with a soulful sound, thoroughly enjoyable.\nBad Taste\u2019s corner\nBad Taste\nRicci has a knack for playing very disturbing girls, this is no exception.\nThis teen comedy from the young, new talent Jonathan Levine,\nwill satisfy all comedy lovers (and those looking for a bit more).\nRegardless of where you stand, Jonathan Dakin has decided to suggest films for both Lovers and Haters \u2013\nfilms that sum up love in all its entirety as well as films that have absolutely no love in them whatsoever.\nJosh Peck has grown up... and become a marijuana-dealing hipster.\nBlack Snake Moan\nDirector: Craig Brewer\nWriter: Craig Brewer\nCast: Samuel L. Jackson,\nCristina Ricci,\nJustin Timberlake\nCompetition Winner\nForthosewhocan\u2019tremember,acouple months ago we asked you about the\nfilm equivalent of the Ig-Noble. The\nprize promised was a DVD of Pineapple Express. Congratulations to\nHazim Ghani\nwho got the answer right \u2013 it is indeed\nthe Golden Raspberry Award. Now\nthat the DVD has arrived at the office,\nI\u2019mhappytotellHazimthathecanpick\nup his prize from the felix office.\nSorry for the delay in resolving the\ncompetition but Sony Entertainment\nwere late with the delivery of the DVD.\n4 Months 3 Weeks 2 Days\nDirector: Cristian Mungiu\nWriter: Cristian Mungiu\nCast: Anamaria Marinca,\nLaura Visiliu,\nVlad Ivanov\nthe population of the world into either\na pulpy, smiley, lovey-dovey mush or\na hard, fierce and embittered slice of\nvengeance.\nLovers are those who love Valentines Day: they take their girlfriends\nor boyfriends out and wine-and-dine\nthem and treat them well and believe\nin fate and the power of love\u2026 and all\nthat sap.\nWhereas Haters very much hate this\nmade-by-greeting-card-companies\nday and everything it stands for as\nit promotes the idea that unless you\nhave someone, you are no one. And of\ncourse we know that is not true, but\nHaters would say that Lovers want to\ntry to make them feel like they are losers because they don\u2019t have a significant other.\nRegardless of where you stand, this\nFilm felix editor has decided to suggest films for both Lovers and Haters\n\u2013 films that sum up love in all its entirety and spin the belief that everyone\nis destined for someone else, as well as\nfilms that have absolutely no love in\nthem whatsoever \u2013 sometimes even\npromoting the hatred of love. And it\nwas quite hard to find films like that,\nbut I managed to do it.\nSo whether you are a Lover or a Hater, kick back, relax and watch films that\nsuit your mood: either snuggling up to\nsomeone you love or getting drunk by\nyourself and throwing bottles at the\nscreen.\nI know which one I will be doing to-morrow, now then, where has that bottle of Jack Daniels gone?\nFor Lovers\nAn Affair To Remember\nStarring Carey Grant and Deborah\nKerr, this film is the inspiration behind\nthe classic Sleepless In Seattle (another\nrecommendation for all you Lovers out\nthere). Set on a cruise ship travelling\nfrom Europe, a singer and an unemployed playboy meet and begin to fall\nin love. The catch? They are both engaged to their other partners, so they\ndecide to give each other until Valentine\u2019s Day (which is two months away)\nto break up with their other lovers, get\nprofessional jobs and then meet on top\nof the Empire State Building. Everything goes to plan until a tragic accident intervenes\u2026\nA film that is guaranteed to make\nwomen sob relentlessly (and as a man\nI do not understand why), so men \u2013 if\nyou want your woman crying into your\nchest (and you win bonus points for\ncomforting her and pretending to understand why she is crying) then this is\na must-see.\nPretty Woman\nWhat woman doesn\u2019t love the idea of a\nprostitute being taken from the streets\nand made up to look like royalty? Julia Roberts and Richard Gere star as\npeople from two different worlds who\nultimately fall in love. The part that\nwomen seem to love is the bit when\nshe goes into a posh shop and is told\nto leave for being too run down, only\nto come back and tell the manager she\nisn\u2019t going to spend her money there:\nyou will be applauding and screaming\nin delight!\nFor those of you who question the\nidea of a love film about a prostitute,\njust try to pretend it is a fairytale rather then reality, because after all: how\nmany hookers look like Julia Roberts\n(and fall in love with the men who pay\nthem to have sex)?\nYou\u2019ve Got Mail\nJoe Fox is a successful bookstore owner\nand Kathleen Kelly has a small children\u2019s bookshop. So when his huge\nchain of Fox Books moves into her\nneighbourhood and her business starts\nto goes under, they obviously hate each\nother. But neither of them know that\nthey are actually in love with one an-other, as they have been exchanging\nlove-letters over the Internet. How will\nit end? Well considering the fact it is\nin this section I think it is obvious that\nthere is no murderous rampage ending\nto this film, so don\u2019t worry! Tom Hanks\nand Meg Ryan sparkle in a memorable and sometimes touching rom-com\nthat will melt your heart and make you\nwish that everyone you met in a chat\nroom wasn\u2019t just a disgusting pervert\nor paedophile.\nSex And The City: The Movie\nOh dear\u2026 Where do I begin? This two\nand half-hour ball-breaker is definitely\none for the ladies. I\u2019m not sure there\nis any point writing a synopsis for this\nas every woman reading this article\nhas probably seen it anyway. But will\nthat stop them from re-watching it? I\ndoubt it. But for the benefit of those of\nyou who haven\u2019t had the pleasure (or\npain) of viewing it, the Sex And The\nCity movie is all about Carrie and her\nfriends trying to hold their relationships together. Some relationships\nend, others are re-ignited. Some end\nwell, others not so well. But the message to take home from this is that men\nare only there to provide you with a\nbigger wardrobe, children and/or sex.\nBut there is a wedding, so the film does\npromote love\u2026 doesn\u2019t it?\nThe Wedding Singer\nEveryone can enjoy this hilarious comedy starring Adam Sandler and Drew\nBarrymore. An unlucky-in-love wedding singer finally finds the woman\nof his dreams \u2013 but she is about to be\nmarry a complete knob. Not only this\nfilm very funny, but also romantic and\nsoppy. Funny bits include when he gets\ndrunkatawedding,theBoyGeorgeim-personator and the rapping Grandma.\nRomantic bits include the bit when she\ndances with an overweight child, and\nthe ending on the aeroplane. This is a\nmovie that both men and women can\nwatch together without feeling secretly\nresentful that one or the other got their\nown way and is forcing you see something you don\u2019t want to\u2026 Whoops \u2013\nmaybe I am bringing up sore points for\nsome of you reading this\u2026\nFor Haters\nValentine\nA serial killer dressed as cupid fires arrows into the hearts of his victims. If\nyou hate Valentine\u2019s Day with a passion\nthen watch this film as it murders love\nwith a hatchet. Who will survive a demented cupid? A cast of extremely sexy\nwomen makes this film even better, as\nBond beauty Denise Richards leads the\ncast of ladies on the run from the killer\nwho has decided that they will all be\nnext. A typical horror with some very\ngrisly scenes (including a face being\nimpaled onto a shard of glass), this film\nwas made with people who hate Valentine\u2019s Day in mind \u2013 so you will be\nsecretly rooting for Cupid to claim his\nvictims. Just make sure you don\u2019t take\na leaf from his book and get revenge on\nformer lovers. It is just a movie! Don\u2019t\ntry it at home no matter how scorned\nyou feel! Buy a punching bag instead!\nKill Bill (1&2)\nOkay, I know the film starts with a\nwedding and there are hints of love in\nbetween massacre, but on the whole\nthis is a film about revenge. Revenge\nagainst a former lover who killed all\nof The Bride\u2019s friends and family on\nher wedding day, shooting her in the\nhead and leaving her to die. Does your\nlove-life sound so bad now? I thought\nnot. And that is why Kill Bill is here,\nbecause The Bride goes on a whirlwind\nrampage of revenge to kill Bill. But she\nleaves him until last \u2013 picking off others who took part in her (almost) de-mise. Does she kill Bill? Well the title\nwould be wrong if she didn\u2019t, but the\njourney to that point is extremely fun\nand gory \u2013 butchering many people in\nhorrible ways. Samurai sword anyone?\nDie Hard With A Vengeance\nNo love. Just action and brotherhood-male bonding over the activities of a\nderanged, German terrorist called Simon. And Simon says that trains will\nexplode, vaults will be broken into and\nJohn McClane (Bruce Willis) will kill\nmany people.\nA very cleverly plotted and executed film, which many say is the best\nDie Hard movie of them all, mainly\nbecause Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) is\ndragged into the antics and has to stay\nto play the games set by Simon. But\nwhy is McClane involved? Is it because\nhe is a cop\u2026 or is it something more\npersonal? Lots of explosions, gunfire\nand death mean that you will not be\nthinking about whatever stupid day it\nis\u2026 good!\nThe Usual Suspects\nOften deemed one of the best films\never made and currently number 22\non IMDB\u2019s top films of all time, this\nis a thriller/gangster/crime film about\neverything except love. Cleverly weaving a story about a crime with a plot\nabout the criminals themselves, the\nfilm twists and turns, exploding into\nan unforgettable climax.\nKevin Spacey chews the scenery in\nhis Academy Award-winning role,\nstealing every scene he is in from an\nall-star cast. Love it or hate it, this\nis a film you can sink into and enjoy,\nmainly because there is no love story!\nJust bad men committing bad deeds\nand ending everything badly. You have\ngot to appreciate this \u2013 it is one of the\ncleverest films ever, even if it does drag\nslightly in the middle.\nSingle White Female\nAllie, a young and beautiful woman is\nbetrayed by her cheating boyfriend, so\nkicks him out and advertises for a new\nroommate. Hedy, who replaces him,\nat first seems perfect, but then turns\nout to be a psycho stalker. This film is\nbrilliantly dark and disturbing, and although it does include love, it is stalker\nlove between women and it is love of\na darker nature, as Hedy is a psycho-path. Brilliant moments include a stiletto heel and someone\u2019s eye (ouch!)\nand a chase through a basement with a\nscrewdriver. You have to be truly twisted to enjoy this film, and that is why\nI thought all of you haters of love out\nthere would appreciate it.\nGrease\nGrease certainly is the word- and this\nmusical classic is extremely romantic.\nWho could resist sexy, hunk Danny or\nvirginal, beauty Sandy? Everyone get\nup and do the hand-jive, baby, because\nthis is one film that says that people\nfrom two different high school cliques\ncan fall in love despite peer pressure.\nOn a different note: I have my own\ntheory about the ending. A car flying\ninto the clouds? It is a metaphor. Two\nwords: car-crash. They didn\u2019t make itas they drove off into the sunset a lorry\nhit and killed them both. But at least\nnow they can drive Greased Lighting\naround the clouds in heaven forever\nand ever\u2026\nBlade\nA half-human, half-vampire hunts and\nkills vampires. That is it really. Just lots\nof guns, swords and blood-soaked ac-tion. There is no love at all, only very\nsexy women who throw themselves\nat Blade (including his own mother\u2026\nyuck\u2026 but saying that she is one hot\nhoney). Can Blade stop a crazy vampire\nfrom taking over the world and killing\nand enslaving all of humanity?\nThe best bits of this film include coagulating heads, the smoulderingly attractive women and the death of many\nvampires. Blood, gore, sex\u2026 Blade has\nit all\u2026 And best of all there is no love\nplot, as Blade is one cold killer and uses\nwomen for one thing and one thing\nonly. And we all know what that is.\nis playing out all the usual teenager\nacts, from being isolated and having problems at home, to listening to\nmusic and selling marijuana. One of\nhis customers happens to be Dr. Jeffrey Squires, a psychiatrist endowed\nwith a few depressions and a delightful step-daughter called Stephanie, to\nwhom Luke is naturally attracted. The\nensuing mix of romance and friendship shapes up for an enjoyable ninety\nminutes, thanks to likable characters,\nauthentic atmosphere, appropriate\nmusic and a well-written script.\nWhat makes The Wackness a good\nfilm is how well the actors inhabit\ntheir characters and how smoothly all\nthe aforementioned elements complement each other to create a great\nviewing experience. There is a distinct\nfeeling that Luke is in no-man\u2019s-land,\nlooking to build and shape his values\nand the soundtrack plays an important part in defining both him and his\nworld. Despite the fact that I am not\na hip-hop fan, I appreciate how representative and influential it can be,\nand its fit with the nature of the film\nwas so good, that I was taken in by it.\nIn the end though, what elevates The\nWackness is the kindness and sincerity of the story and its protagonists.\nI may have a positive bias towards\nthe more classic-style of teenage com-edy, whether we\u2019re talking about The\nBreakfast Club, Say Anything or The\nLast American Virgin, but there\u2019s\nnothing blander than a lacklustre and\nunimaginative teen-com, such as St.\nElmo\u2019s Fire or various \u201coriginal\u201d and\nobnoxious newer attempts, say Sex\nDrive. Still, do give The Wackness a\nshot, chances are there is some truth\nto my allegations.\n\n"

But by 5pm GMT, barely-credible reports were filtering in to\nUEFA, FIFA and James Skeen concerning the spectacular upset of an RSM\nvictory over the World famous Imperial College 7th team, more commonly\nknown to the sporting world as \u201cThe\nUntouchables\u201d. Below is the captain\u2019s\naccount of the bizarre events that occurred on the day that shook the football establishment to the core\u2026\nThe game was held at Fortress Harlington, where IC 7s were undefeated\nall season (and still are in home fix-tures) but as they were the only Imperial team playing there that day they had\nto take public transport rather than the\ncustomary coach. Sadly this proved too\nmuch for striker Ian Welch-Phillips.\nAfter waking up late he managed to\nmiss his stop and arrived ridiculously\nlate. By the time he was on the pitch\nwe were 2-nil down due to my rather\nuninspired choice of a 3-5-1 formation\nand the absence of centre backs Greg\nTainter and Chris Tennant who had\nmade prior arrangements to attend a\nCheeky Girls concert (the tickets acquired no doubt with RSM money).\nTwenty minutes in, the game was\nshaping up to be an English Thermopylae: Our vastly outnumbered\nbut far more skilled/disciplined/good-looking boys were struggling to hold\noff the mighty RSM war-machine. In\nopen play they were dominating with\nonly my electric pace and stunning\nnaturally ability holding back a tide of\nRSM attacks.\nAt this stage we changed to a 4-4-2\nformation with the defence working\ntogether well. Unfortunately the rest of\nthe team seemed rather lethargic and\nunwilling to chase the ball down giving\nRSM plenty of time on the ball. The notable exception to the rule was Wynne\nEvans, who delivered a rip-roaring tour\nde force performance in midfield and\nran a total of 28.42 miles in the game as\nconfirmed by post-game analysis.\nKiran Lal, our sixth team ringer\n(mwah hah ha) was finally coaxed out\nof the centre circle just after half time.\nHe immediately proceeded to head\nhome one a strong contender for goal\nof the season from a thundering Asim\ncross. At this stage I felt a surge of confidence but try as we might, we were\nunable to get our passing game going\nand RSM returned to dominance. Particularly worrying was their number 8,\nwho was quite obviously a ringer from\na higher RSM team. Even I barely got\naway with a second nutmeg against\nhim and decided not to repeat the trick\nmore than a few times more.\nIn the last few minutes a rogue sand\nparticle blew across the pitch into my\neye. In a temporary moment of hesitation I was caught unawares and lobbed\nby their striker (who I\u2019ve seen playing\nfor Millwall before). He proceeded to\nalso lob our keeper Ryan Apicella, who\nwas faultless all game, apart from his\nconsistent major errors.\nDespite the score-line I don\u2019t think\nwe played particularly badly and it was\nRSM that won the game, not us that\nlost it (unless you look at the score-line). Mitun Patel, Xavier Scott and\nAnthony Petane were solid at the back\nand Azat Tatygulov and Henry Balston were persistent up front despite\ntheir lack of service. A special mention\nshould go to me for my consistent raising of the bar in footballing quality and\nit seems only a matter of time before\nSir Alex sits up and takes notice. The\n7ths retired to our spiritual home (the\nunion) and reflected on the game with\nquiet contemplation and a half-pint of\nshandy or two.\nI would like to highlight my opposing view to Mr Botchway with regards\nto RSM/Medic teams. As was made\nabundantly clear on that Saturday\nthey do indeed have important places\nin University football; the ones a few\nspots below us in the league\u2026 WEIII!!!\nFootball\nImperial College Men\u2019s 1st XI 1\nRoyal School of Mines 7th XI 3\nAfter a less than ideal outcome in the\nfirst round of the Women\u2019s BUCS Futsal qualifiers, it was with a mix of apprehension and determination that the\nIC Futsal team travelled to Brighton for\ntheir remaining group matches, knowing that only victories would send them\nto the BUCS Championships.\nBournemouth University were the\nfirst opponents. In what was a match\nto decide the 3rd placed team in the\ngroup, the victors would be rewarded\nwith a playoff against Buckinghamshire\nNew University, with the losers having\nthe less than appealing prospect of a\nplayoff against Brunel.\nIC began well with some crisp passing coupled with a disciplined defence,\nholding their 2-2 formation perfectly.\nAlthough Bournemouth started the\nday in the coveted 3rd place, they were\nno match for Yoke Thye and Maria Envall up front as the first goal arrived,\ncourtesy of well-executed kick-in set\npiece.\nWith support from Dehydys Pimentel and Laura in defence, and the somewhat vociferous Gui Barbosa coaching\nfrom the sidelines, Maria finished a\nlovely move with a powerful drive into\nthe bottom corner to put IC ahead.\nAs the second half wore on and\nBournemouth became increasingly\ndesperate for a goal, a brief lapse in\ndefence saw a shot blocked on the line\nfrom 1m out as IC goalkeeper Emily\nPotter managed to react in time to\npush the ball away and keep IC ahead.\nHowever, Bournemouth\u2019s increasing offensive operations eventually left\nthem exposed at the back for IC to seal\ntheir victory, with Maria adding another goal leaving next to no chance for a\ncomeback. True to form a 2-0 win was\nsecured, and IC finished 3rd in Group\nA, avoiding Brunel.\nFresh from their first ever futsal win,\nand confident of keeping another clean\nsheet, IC then took on Bucks New Uni.\nThe Bucks team were a lot more physical than Bournemouth, but IC adapted\ntheir style and passed around the Bucks\nplayers effectively, with another forceful drive by Maria securing a 1-0 lead\ngoing into the half-time break.\nBucks had seen many attacking positions in the first half but had yet to\ncapitalise on them, and this inspired\nthem to come out all guns blazing in\nthe second half. Not to be deterred, a\nfew saves from Emily and some great\n1v1 play from both Laura and Dehydys\nkept the ball out of the IC net.\nA free kick was cynically gained by\nBucks just outside the IC area, and\nwith Emily\u2019s line of sight blocked by a\nrather large opposition forward, IC did\nwell to clear the ball. With Gui calling\ntimeouts for IC, a few key plays were\nworked on to find that elusive second\ngoal. With Dehydys running into space\non the right, long balls sliced through\nthe Bucks formations, and eventually the second goal came, as IC kept\npossession of the ball and worked an\nopening for Yoke to finish past the onrushing keeper.\nUnsatisfied however, the best move\nof the day was to be reserved for the\nicing on the Imperial cake. From the\ndeep left of defence, Laura took a pinpoint kick-in, high up field to Maria,\nwho was in an advanced position on\nthe right of the Bucks area.\nAnother pin-point pass followed, as\nMaria volleyed the ball in front of the\nBucks keeper to Yoke, who added the\nfinishing touch with a side-foot volley\nat the far post to emphatically seal the\nwin.\nHappy to sit back and defend for the\nremaining time, Lily Low was brought\non to introduce some fresh legs and\nwatertight defending, and together IC\nkept a ferocious Bucks team at bay until the final whistle.\nImperial Women\u2019s Futsal team can\nnow look forward to the BUCS finals in\nMarch, where they\u2019ll compete against\n7 other teams for the title of BUCS Futsal Champions 2008/2009!\n\n"

    "content": "eVoting\nSABBATICAL ELECTIONS 09\nNominations open Monday 16 Febr\nFor more information and to stand: imperialcollegeunion.org/elections\nMonday\nMonday mornings are quite possibly the worst\ninvention I ever heard of, but the world insists\non keeping them, so at 7am I reluctantly get out\nof bed. I\u2019m one of the Sabbaticals that chose not\nto live in halls (it\u2019s not compulsory and with the\nincreasing pressure of finding all the first years\na place in halls it\u2019s no bad thing). Work officially\nstarts at 10am which is lovely but you do need\nto stay late quite often so it balances out.\nFirst thing I\u2019ve got a meeting with the Head of\nCommercial Services, this is a regular meeting\nonce a month where we discuss the latest\nissues with commercial services, ranging from\ngym access to water availability. I bring to his\nattention anything students are worried about\nand our opinion is always taken very seriously\n\u2013 such as when we said the SCR needs longer\nopening hours \u2013 it was done. After that meeting\nI whiz over to the Union Building project meeting\nwhere all the contractors, architects, plumbers,\nsystems people and so on meet with the project\nmanager to discuss the weeks schedule and iron\nout any bumps. Then I\u2019ve got a couple of free\nhours allowing me email catch up and time to\nsign off a moderate pile of cheques (anything\nover a thousand pounds needs to be co-signed\nby the President) for things like the Building\nProject and stock for the shops and bars. In\nthe afternoon I have to attend an exercise as\na member of the Senior Emergency Response\nGroup. This group of Senior College staff get\ncalled in at any time of the day or night to\nrespond to emergency situations (in reality once\nevery 50 years), but the last time was 7/7. So as\nPresident you get to have a go at pretending to\nbe James Bond twice a year on exercise, but in\nreality hopefully you won\u2019t have to do it for real.\nI finish off the day with Union Council.\nTuesday\nToday I only have an hour to catch up on the\nlatest emails and make a few phone calls to\ntie up any loose ends before I\u2019ve got to head\noff to get to Cambridge for 12noon in time for\nan Aldwych Group meeting; we have these\nroughly once a month. The Aldwych group is\nmade up of all of the Unions of the Russell\nGroup Universities and we meet at a different\nStudents\u2019 Union every time. At these meetings\nwe share best practice on a whole range of\nthings \u2013 like swapping ideas on widening\nparticipation or lobbying the government on the\nup and coming funding review for tuition fees.\nIt\u2019s really good to know what the other Unions\nare up to \u2013 often policies will work well in more\nthan one Union. The other meeting I have about\nonce a month is ULU Senate, this is like our\nCouncil where the ULU Sabbatical Officers report\non what they\u2019ve been up to (usually not a lot)\nand papers are brought by the different Unions,\nin the same way that Imperial Students and\nreps might bring a paper to our Union Council.\nEven though the College has officially left the\nUniversity of London, there are still students\nthat have chosen to keep the UoL degree rather\nthan an Imperial one and those students are still\nrepresented by ULU and we are still very closely\nlinked through sport and so the Imperial voice is\nstill hugely important.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday I\u2019m back in the office and have\nabout an hour to catch up on emails and clear\nup the most recent crisis before I head off to a\nmeeting with the Rector. I have regular meetings\nwith the Rector (once a month) which is great.\nAll of the big issues get raised through him\nand our views are taken very seriously and\noften acted on almost immediately if they are\nreasonable. In the afternoon I have time to\nwrite a paper for College Council. They meet\nfive times a year and the President is a member.\nUltimately the President is responsible for the\nUnion\u2019s Finances to the College Council and any\nchanges to our constitution have to be approved\nby them (formality due to the Education Act 94\n\u2013 usually just a rubber stamping exercise.) Then\nlater Jov, Felix Editor, rings me up for a quote on\nthe latest issues, this time the security breach\non the Union\u2019s online files. He\u2019ll often ask for a\nquote whether it is within the Union, College or\neven externally (like those ridiculous national\nID cards!) Later on Stoic drops by and asks for\na very quick interview after the recent paper at\nUnion Council passed which created another\nSabbatical role and I\u2019m very pleased to oblige\nbut it can only take thirty seconds because\nI need to run off to have a meeting with the\nStudent Adviser.\nThursday\nIt\u2019s a 9am start and Hannah and I have a\nmeeting with the Pro Rector (Education) and\nCollege Secretary. We meet with them once a\nmonth to discuss major education issues \u2013 like\nstudent survey results we also recieve guidance\nfrom the College Secretary on things that are\ncontentious. They always bring things to our\nattention that they would like our help on too.\nLater in the morning I need to email the Union\nCourt Chair. The Union Court is relatively new\nand was brought in at the same time as the\nTrustee Board in the governance review two\nyears ago. Whenever there\u2019s confusion over the\nconstitution and regulations we can ask court\nto write an interpretation for us. When we have\nstudent disciplinary the Court will select the\npanel and they also select the returning officer\nand elections committee for the main elections.\nThis ensures absolutely no bias on those people\nwho are selected. If there is an appeal over a\nUnion disciplinary then it goes to Court too. In\nthe afternoon I have time to go through this\nmonths management accounts which takes\na good hour or so but it\u2019s worthwhile going\nthrough to see if the Union is overspending\nanywhere and to make sure our members are\ngetting the best possible services from us. I find\nmyself with a light afternoon and reinvigorate\nmy research into student discounts and the\nNUS card. There are instances when Imperial\nstudents miss out on discounts because they\ndon\u2019t have an NUS card (very annoying!!) This\nis going to take some serious letter writing!\nLater that evening we have Representation and\nWelfare Board which Hannah chairs, I run across\nto High Street Ken to buy the cake that Hannah\npromised she would bring to her committee\nmembers after seeing a pitiful collection of the\ncollege biscuits she\u2019s been hoarding that she\nwas going to pass off instead (minus the special\nchocolate ones that she\u2019s keeping locked in the\ndrawer for emergencies!)\nAt last it\u2019s Friday!\nI have meetings with CAG and RAG as they\u2019re\nboth Presidential committees and I try to give\nthem as much support as possible. CAG is taking\npart in this very exciting pilot scheme with an\norganisation called FoodWorks and I meet with\ntheir director as well to discuss fun things like\ninsurance and health and safety. Later in the day\nI start collecting papers and getting things ready\nfor the Trustee Board, this is the sovereign body\nof the Union, they have a very light fingered\ntouch but are ultimately legally responsible if it\nall goes wrong, so they ensure that the decisions\nwe make don\u2019t have massive implications on\nrisk. No longer are all the Exec members liable\nto be sued for seven years after they\u2019ve left the\npost, now it\u2019s the Trustees. And the externals\nbring in a wealth of experience from different\nareas such as finance and law. Later on I can\ncatch with emails before the weekend and I can\ngo through the applications for funding from\nthe Harlington Trust before giving my feedback\nto the rest of the Harlington Trust Committee\n(it\u2019s made up of the Pro Rector (Education), a\npast Union President and the current Union\nPresident). We get several applications a month,\nusually for new equipment for clubs. We have\n~\u00a350k to award each year to deserving clubs\nthat really need some help. Later I pop over to\nthe HR department to discuss the latest staffing\nissues. It\u2019s quite scary as President that you\ndo oversee all of the staffing in the Union, not\nsomething that can be discussed so that\u2019s a part\nof the job that students don\u2019t get to hear about\nbecause of our lovely staff student protocol. But\ndon\u2019t be scared by that \u2013 everyone at HR is very\nhelpful and guides you through everything step\nby step and most of the day to day things are\nhandled by the general manager anyway \u2013 that\u2019s\none of the perks of being the president \u2013 you get\nto delegate!\nNo week is the same and there are always\nplenty of surprises to keep you on your toes. But\nthe difference you can make that benefits the\nlives of students makes it the most rewarding\njob you can ever expect to have\nA week in the life of the President...\nNo two days the same.\nSTAND\n& DELIVER\nuary 00:01 - Sunday 1 March 23:59\nMonday\nDespite my alarm being set for 8am, a fondness\nfor my snooze button means I wake again\nwith a start at 9.15am- I\u2019m supposed to be at\nwork by 10 so it\u2019s a toss-up between makeup application and breakfast. The toast loses\nout because I\u2019ve got the first of the week\u2019s\nmeetings at 11am which means breakfast of\ncoffee and College biscuits. Yum. After a frantic\nrush from Evelyn Gardens (one of the perks of\nthe job is \u2018free\u2019 accommodation in an Imperial\nHalls of Residence of your choice), I run to my\nmeeting where we\u2019re reviewing our welfare\nprovision in the College and identifying areas\nfor improvement. I add my views, scribble down\nsome action points and then head to my office\nan hour and a half later for some email catch-up, phone calls and lunch from the Union. The\nafternoon consists of a couple more one-on-one\nmeetings about security and our Environmental\nPolicy, 20 more emails to write and a slight panic\nabout the welfare campaign that\u2019s supposed to\nbe running next week. I grab the promotional\nstationery catalogue and a cup of tea and start\nbrowsing\u2026\nThis evening is Union council, which happens\nonce a month. This is where we debate about\nand pass policies affecting Imperial students,\nhighlighting what students want us to be\nprioritizing. One of the decisions made this year\nwas to split my position in two, meaning the\nDeputy President (Education and Welfare) will\ncease to exist, replaced instead with a Deputy\nPresident (Education) and Deputy President\n(Welfare). My successors need not fear- I\u2019ve got\na military-style training programme planned so\nthey can hit the ground running when I depart for\ngood on July 31st\u2026.\nTuesday\nToday\u2019s meetings have more of an education\nfocus, with Science Studies Committee\nfollowed by a meeting to discuss Assessment\nand Feedback, something which we\u2019re not\nscoring as highly in student surveys as we\nlike. The preparation for these meetings can\nbe immense, and I\u2019m glad I got most of the\nleg-work done last week. This is followed by a\nlunchtime presentation on the new visa rules.\nThis year my brain has turned into a veritable\nsponge, absorbing all sorts of education and\nwelfare-related information and tit-bits. Some\nof it is certainly more useful than others, but if\nyou want opening hours for local doctors, our\npolicy on student withdrawals or our student\nsatisfaction score on the NSS please feel free\nto ask!\nTonight I\u2019m on the first of my many halls visits.\nI head off with a junk food-loaded bag on my\nback to quiz the students about what they really\nlove and hate about living there so I can let the\nHead of Accommodation services know what the\nstudents think when I meet her next week. I get\nback to the office to find an email from one of\nthe wardens asking if I am available next week\nto be on the interview panel for their subwarden\nselection. I found conducting interviews nerve-wracking when I first started but now I rather\nenjoy grilling the candidates. It\u2019s also a chance\nto compare which wardens have the nicest flats\nand most importantly, who orders in the nicest\nfood (Thai wins so far!). However, tonight it\u2019s\na Union dinner of fish and chips, followed by a\npack of some biscuits left over from an earlier\nmeeting in College. For a change.\nWednesday\nAfter the success of SHAG week, I\u2019ve arranged\nwith the Terrence Higgins Trust to come in and\noffer Chlamydia screening to more Imperial\nstudents. After some initial trepidation, this\nhas been growing in popularity. Jov, the Felix\neditor rings me up and asks the dreaded\nquestion: \u2018So, Hannah, where\u2019s that page on\nwelfare you promised me?\u2019. Hmmm\u2026. It hasn\u2019t\nbeen forgotten as such, just pushed out of the\nforefront of my mind by eight more pressing\npriorities. \u2018It\u2019ll be with you in 2 hours\u2019, I say,\nglancing at the clock and staring at the 2 lines\nI\u2019ve written so far. Then a student knocks on my\ndoor- they\u2019ve had problems paying their tuition\nfees and need some support and advice. The\narticle glares at me from my computer screen,\nbut I turn my back and we devise a plan of\naction that means a few phone calls to some\nCollege Departments. As the student leaves,\nwith instructions to put the finer details down\nin an email to me, I turn back to the screen and\nstare at the cursor until I\u2019m distracted by an\nurgent email until I am rudely interrupted by\nmy phone. It\u2019s Jov ringing to tell me he\u2019s almost\ngiven up and has filled half the page with an\nadvert already. Argh! With half an hour until\nSafer Neighbourhoods to go, I frantically tap\naway until something half resembling an article\nis winging its way to his inbox at two minutes\nto six. I run to the Sherfield where the Head of\nSecurity has luckily supplied some sandwiches\nand biscuits (hooray!) to get us through the next\ntwo hours of crime statistics and giving local\npolice their priorities. Despite the best efforts\nof the locals to get them to focus on removing\nbeggars from the South Kensington area, our\nsuggestion to tackle bike thefts from the campus\nwins the vote. My work is done. Unfortunately,\nsix of their beloved pooches were struck down\nby pavement cyclists last year, so the police will\nalso be issuing fines to those of you they catch.\nI\u2019m tired of feeling like I\u2019m not on top of\nthings,so I head back to the Union to catch up\non a load of work. It\u2019s sports night and I can\nhear inebriated students lobbing skiffs around\nthe Quad outside, but I plough on through\nurgent emails and write some of the papers for\ntomorrow\u2019s Union meeting. I am turfed out by\nthe stewards at the end of the night, who offer\nme a lift home.\nThursday\nAmazingly, I only have one meeting scheduled\ntoday. This is dangerous, because somehow at\nleast 2 more unscheduled ones will manage to\nfind their way into my diary by the end of the\nday. It\u2019s also lucky, because I have only written\nhalf of the papers for tonight\u2019s Representation\nand Welfare Board meeting which I chair.\nIn between bashing out documents on the\ncomputer I email people who were supposed\nwho have submitted something already. Ideally\nthe papers should have been up a few days ago\nfor everyone\u2019s perusal, but unless I sat down\nat the weekend and did them with a cup of tea\nit\u2019s a rare occurrence- there\u2019s nothing like an\nimpending deadline to kick start a student into\naction. It\u2019s crisps for dinner plus some cake while\nall the welfare and academic reps come together\nto discuss issues that have come up in recent\nCollege meetings, as well as some of the other\nproblems Imperial students have encountered as\nwell as allocating money to campaigns students\nand societies want to run.\nI\u2019ve been asked to review a few documents by\nthe College and because it\u2019s 2-for-4 at Ask ,\nthe Medic\u2019s Union President and I head off for\na working dinner round the corner. Three hours\nlater, forty pages of annotated policies covered\nin highlighter and a couple of glasses of wine\ndown I feel like I\u2019m back to square one. I think\nit\u2019s definitely time for bed.\nFriday\nUh-oh. Today is a Graduate School\u2019s meeting.\nThe printer seems to have messed up so I had\nonly half of the thirty-six papers waiting in my\npigeon hole. I\u2019ve only just noticed whilst sitting\nin another meeting about Careers and I\u2019m\nforwarding the missing ones from my iPhone\nto Union reception in the vain hope they\u2019ll have\ntime to print them in the next half an hour. I hear\nnothing back and realize the receptionist must\nbe on lunch. Oh well, I read them a week ago\nand hope I can dredge up what they\u2019re talking\nabout from memory.\nPhew, after the 10th examiner\u2019s report (where\nsomeone external from College comments on\nhow well we\u2019re conducting our assessments) I\nseem to have got away with it. Until I\u2019m asked\nmy opinion on Paper Liii. Paper Liii\u2026 I hide my\npanic with a smile and say none of the student\nreps had any comments or objections. I assume\nwe didn\u2019t or either myself or one of my reps\nwould have discussed it last week- wouldn\u2019t\nwe? As we move onto paper M, I gulp down my\ngourmet tea and the chocolate coated biscuits\nand breathe a sigh of relief. Because tomorrow,\nafter a lie-in, I will pull on my boots and jacket\nand amble down King\u2019s Road to spend my hard-earned cash. The weekend vanishes in a flurry of\nfood, sleep, a reluctant gym visit and shopping,\nready to start all over again the following\nMonday.\nThis job can be as easy or hard as you make\nit. The majority of the time I love it, and often\nfeel disappointment when you realize you\u2019ve\nonly got a year to achieve all of your aims.\nAs you can tell from above, I often sign up to\nmore than I can manage, with a lot of my days\nfuelled by stress and sugar alone. However, it\u2019s\nmore than worth it when you get an email from\na student thanking you for your efforts or lie\nin bed knowing that through your persistence\n(and diplomacy!) you\u2019ve made something about\nstudents\u2019 lives at Imperial that bit better, even\nif they don\u2019t always directly know it. And that\u2019s\nwhat it\u2019s all about which is why, if given the\nopportunity, I\u2019d never go back and click on\n\u2018Withdraw from election\u2019. Not for all the biscuits\nin the world.\nA week in the life of the\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare)...\nThe secret life of a\nbiscuit addict.\nLook online\nfor the other \u2018Week\nin the life of\u2019 articles.\nNext week - DPCS,\nDPFS &\nFelix Editor\n\n"

This intriguing field of evolutionary biology\nand psychology dwells upon our obsessions with sex and various peculiarities\nassociated with human practice of sex.\nIt does this in order to understand better just how big a role sex has played\nin our evolution, and just how much of\nwhat we do is down to what our ancestors have been selected to do by forces\nof sexual selection.\nAttitudes towards sex differ spatially\nand temporally; in various cultures\nand in different historical time peri-ods. Current, relatively liberal views\nof human sexuality in the west allow\nmany of our tendencies to emerge\nfrom the taboo vaults into the mainstream \u2013 e.g. film, media, advertising\n\u2013 and also allow scientists to probe the\nmeaning of and possible reasons for\nthese tendencies. Sexual health is an\nimportant feature of modern day life:\nwith many couples having problems\nconceiving, and with many sexually\ntransmitted epidemics such as HIV,\nknowing how to deal with these issues\nis an important medical task. Recent\nbreakthroughs such as the production of sperm cells out of adult bone\nmarrow stem cells and the development of an HPV vaccine which can\nprevent cervical cancer caused by the\nvirus (some research even suggests a\nlink between oral sex and throat cancer caused by HPV virus) raise hope\nfor future medical interventions to\ntreat infertility and STDs. However,\napart from the medical implications,\nour sexuality has much more to offer\nto people who dare to ask the question \u2018Why?\u2019 Why do we enjoy sex so\nmuch? Why are people jealous of their\nsexual partners and why do we dislike\ninfidelity so much? Why is the penis\nshaped the way it is? Why do women\nexperience amazing orgasms? Why do\nwe waste time masturbating?\nOne of the main premises of research on human sexuality is that men\ncan increase their biological fitness\n(i.e. number of children, therefore\ngenes produced) by having sex with as\nmany women as possible. At the same\ntime women can increase their fitness by having sex with the best quality men (men with the best or most\nThe science of human sexuality\ncompatible genes). This central part\nof sexual selection theory gives rise\nto inter-sexual conflict: men should\nbe promiscuous, but women should\nas well. However, men will try to prevent cuckoldry because if this hap-pens, they end up raising other men\u2019s\nchildren at their own expense. Women\nwill also want to keep their partner\u2019s\nattention regardless of whether the\nchildren were conceived with someone else. In a nutshell then: men want\nto be promiscuous yet want women to\nbe faithful; women want men to think\nthat they are faithful so that these men\nwill dedicate their care to them and\ntheir children, yet women still want\nto be promiscuous in order to get the\nbest genes for their children.\nIn order for such a state of affairs to\nevolve, women must have been promiscuous during our evolutionary\nhistory: men can only be unfaithful\nif they have someone to be unfaithful\nwith. Yet we cannot go back in time,\nso scientists, using various question-naires, have tried to quantify women\u2019s\npresent propensity to be promiscu-ous. It turns out that women are quite\npromiscuous; up to 30% of women report having had sex with two or more\nmen within 24h. This in turn leads to\na rather high percentage of children\nwhose biological father is different to\ntheir mother\u2019s husband: it is estimated\nthat 2-30% of children are not fathered\nby the man who thinks he is the father\n(usually mother\u2019s husband). Naturally,\nif evolution has favoured promiscuity\nin women so that they can give birth\nto the fittest children then there was a\nconflict with men\u2019s evolutionary inter-ests, which would have them care only\nfor their own children and avoid being\ncuckolded in the first place. Indeed,\nmany studies have found that fathers\ntake better care of and develop a better\nrelationship with children that resemble them more. Also, blue-eyed men\nprefer blue-eyed women as mates,\nwhich may be an evolved strategy of\npaternity assurance: if a blue-eyed female partner sleeps with a non-blue-eyed man her children will not have\nblue eyes, this will then be an obvious\nindication for the blue-eyed man that\nhe has been cuckolded (if he is the fa-ther, all of the children will have blue\neyes). Furthermore, infanticide rates\nare higher for stepfathers than biological fathers again supporting the idea\nthat men have evolved to avoid cuck-oldry and if this fails to then avoid taking care of other men\u2019s children.\nWomen increase their sexual fantasies of having sex with other men during ovulation; the time they are most\nlikely to conceive. At this time, women\nalso rate more masculine men as more\nattractive- a preference not present at\nother times of the month. Presumably,\nmore masculine features such as facial\nsymmetry, deep voice and body musculature reflect good genes. Women\ncan distinguish attractiveness by men\u2019s\nvoices, smell of their sweat and looks.\nOne recent study identified a molecule\nfrom men\u2019s sweat that is responsible\nfor getting women aroused and excit-ed: androstadienone . This seems to be\nthe first firm evidence for the existence\nof pheromones in humans; something\nperfume and deodorant companies\nhave been trying to cash in on for some\ntime now (think of Axe effect and the\nrecent Lynx adverts). But, as nature has\nit, men have evolved an ability to recognize when their partners are at this,\nfor men, risky time periods. Although\nwomen have concealed ovulation, a\nrarity among other apes and monkeys,\nmen seemed to be able to detect it in\nwomen\u2019s smell. When asked to rate attractiveness of women sweat scents,\nmen rated ovulating women\u2019s scents\nas more attractive. This could benefit\nmen by cuing them in on potential ex-tra-pair copulations as well as on the\nfact that their partner might be up to\nmischievous things. Indeed, men rate\ntheir partners as much more attractive\nwhen they are ovulating, even though\nthey are not conscious of this difference in their opinion of how sexy their\npartners are.\nThe arms race of tactic, contra-tac-tic evolution is a trademark of sexual\nselection and inter-sexual conflict in\nmost species that use sex for repro-duction, including humans. Women\nmay have evolved the clitoris and orgasms in order to choose whose sperm\nto accept, that is, in order to subconsciously choose the father of their\nchildren even after having sex with\nmore than one man during ovulation.\nThis so-called \u2018cryptic female choice\u2019\nallows a woman to fool her partner\ninto thinking that he is the father,\nwhilst the truth is somewhat different.\nWomen have more simultaneous orgasms with more attractive and more\nsymmetrical men (proximate cues of\ngood genes); simultaneous orgasms\nseem to help to get the sperm closer\nto the egg by a physiological action of\nthe cervix which dips into the deposited sperm and brings it deeper into\nthe woman\u2019s body. So, female orgasms\nmay be an evolved feature allowing\nwomen a post-coital choice in the father for their children. Perhaps this is\nwhy men get so upset when they find\nout that their partner has been faking\norgasms with them....\nApartfromthecrypticfemalechoice,\nmen can also have a say in how their\nsperm fare in the face of the competition for the limited resource; women\u2019s\novum. Men may have evolved penises\nsuch that their morphology allows\nthem, when having sex, to extract the\nsperm of rival men and get their own\nsperm as close to an ovum as possible.\nSome research suggests that the pe-nis, shaped as it is with coronal ridges\nand a frenulum, extracts significantly\nlarger amount of previously deposited\nsperm than a smooth penis-like model\nof similar size. The fact that humans\nhave a large penis and testes compared\nto less promiscuous gorillas (but not as\nlarge as highly promiscuous bonobos)\nsuggests that there is an intermediate\ndegree of sperm competition taking\nplace in humans. Sperm competition\nis predicted to evolve when a female\nmates with more than one male in a\nshort period of time; in humans, this\ntime period is 2-9 days (longevity of\nsperm once ejaculated). Again, some\nstudies suggest that many women\n(up to 30%) do engage in sequential\nsex with different partners in such\nshort time periods, thereby allowing\npotential for sperm competition in\nhumans to evolve. Many women fan-tasise about sex with men other than\ntheir current partner and with more\nthan one man and are more likely to\nengage in risky sexual behaviours during ovulation. Men\u2019s jealousy, appetite\nfor sexual variety and fantasies of sex\nwith more than one woman can all be\ninterpreted as adaptations in response\nto promiscuous behaviour in women.\nInterestingly, individual differences in\nhuman sex drives may be dictated by\nour genes.\nIn an environment where sexual\ncompetition continues post-copula-tion, to ensure their competitiveness,\nit pays for men to evolve adaptive\nmechanisms in sperm competition. In\nhumans, the perception of a high risk\nof sperm competition may increase\nsexual arousal which in turn increases\nthe volume and quality of sperm ejac-ulated. Seeing other men copulating\nwould be perceived as a risk of sperm\ncompetition: the more men, the higher\nthe risk. Internet pornography sites\ncontain more images of one woman\nwith two or more men than the other\nway around; men also report such images to be more arousing. Some even\ninterpret the popularity of swinging\nand \u2018dogging\u2019 as a by-product of an\nevolved tendency to be aroused by\nwomen having sex with other men in\norder to \u2018gear up\u2019 for the sperm competition ahead. Men may even have\nevolved behavioural adaptations to\nsperm competition pressure: copulation that takes place after prolonged\nperiods spent separated from one\u2019s\npartner or after arguments (situa-tions in which there is a potentially\nincreased chance of female infidelity)\nare more vigorous with deeper and\nfaster thrusting movements; both of\nwhich may result in more of the rival\u2019s\nsperm being removed while one\u2019s own\nsperm is brought closer to the egg.\nRape may be biologically yet another\nadaptation evolved in men to increase\ntheir number of sexual partners. It is\nimportant to separate biology from issues of morality: many make the fallacious assumption that evolved behaviours must be morally acceptable, but\nthis is not so. Between 10 and 17% of\nwomen experience rape by their hus-band, while about 9% of women are\nraped by their partners in long-term\nrelationships. This type of rape, forced\nin-pair copulation (FIPC), may be another anti-cuckoldry adaptation and\na sperm competition tactic allowing\nmen to compensate for their partner\u2019s\ninfidelity and ensure they are investing in their own children. Research\nsupports the hypothesis that FIPC\noccurs more often when the woman\nin the pair is unfaithful and when the\nman is generally more jealous, showing many mate-retention behaviours\n(such as holding hands, not introducing a partner to his male friends etc.).\n\u2018While the damaging practice of rape\nis often tolerated in couples, there\nhas traditionally been a strong taboo\nagainst masturbation, which doesn\u2019t\nhurt anyone and may even be evolutionarily adaptive: masturbation by\nmen may be a tactic to get rid of old,\nslow sperm and so better prepare for\nsperm competition if the opportunity\narises. The quality of masturbatory\nsperm ejaculates is lower than that of\nthe copulatory ejaculates and this fact\nmay be used to increase the success of\nartificial inseminations.\nResearch on the evolution of human\nsexuality is full of fascinating and elucidating ideas: cryptic female choice,\nsperm competition, pheromones\u2026 All\nof these have been widely documented\nin various animal species, and now\nmore and more research suggests that\nsexual selection also played important\nrole in human evolution: it may well\nhave shaped many aspects of our mor-phology, physiology, psychology and\nbehaviour. Even the biggest evolutionary riddle, altruism (helping others\nat an expense to oneself), may have\nevolved by means of sexual selection.\nRecent paper shows evidence that humans are more altruistic towards more\nattractive members of the opposite sex\nand that we find more altruistic people of the opposite sex more attractive:\nthus helping others may have been\nbeneficial because it brought us more\nattractive, better quality mates. Study\nof sex in humans can explain various\n\u201cSexual selection\ntheory gives\nrise to intersexual conflict:\nmen should be\npromiscuous,\nbut women\nshould as well.\u201d\n\u201cThis intriguing\nfield of\nevolutionary\nbiology and\npsychology\ndwells upon our\nobsessions with\nsex\u201d\nNow do you see why you should keep your eyes closed when kissing?\nEven in x-ray, it\u2019s still obvious that you\u2019re a chav.

Even\na quick internet search reveals more of\nthe condemned\u2019s misquotes, poor reporting and general unproffesionalism.\nFor someone who is even the deputy\neditor of the paper, this is inexcusable!\nOne feels he should perhaps spend\nmore time learning to be a journalist\nand practising his penmanship than\nharassing small children and Sir Isaac\nNewton at the Science Museum.\n\u201cFrankly, Ladies and Gentlemen, we\nare doomed...\u201d (The Condemned, Felix\n#1423) is a phrase that easily comes to\nmind! To be fair to the condemned;\nhe is in fact spreading the word and\npublicising \u2018Gnome Theory\u2019 \u2013 a noble cause in itself. Too few are aware\nthat the main physics principles can\nbe explained away by the existence of\ntiny gnomes and their interactions (see\naforementioned Facebook group). A\nman so intent on mentioning (if not\nreferencing) this theory at least deserves recognition, despite this deep\n(deep, deep) down longing being hidden in utter drivel. I must commend\na man who looks to further scientific\nthought (especially at this university)\nand am glad he has brought further\nattention to the fledgling theory. Perhaps he may like to complete a proper\nreport on the theory in recompense?\nIn conclusion it seems that though\njournalism is on the down \u2013 perhaps\n\u2018Gnome Theory\u2019 is on the up and thus\nmynetemotionissatisfaction.

As a final thought, I would\nalso like to set the challenge to see who\ncan find where this quote is from: \u201cThe\nTrustee Board requires members that\nare hard working, strong-willed and\nmost importantly that have a vision\nfor the Union.\u201d (... suppose I\u2019d better\nreference it though...

But I apologise for not including a bibliography. However, plagiarism is a serious accusation and I\nreject it. While I did use the language of\nanother author it was not my intention,\nnor was it the result, that it was represented as my original work. \u201cGnome\nTheory\u201d is widely known (as you say,\nthe Facebook group is now infamous)\nand so it was unnecessary to explicitly reference it . In any case the joke\nAn outraged\ngnome\nAn outraged\nbusiness school\nstudent\nthat the Science Museum would teach\nGnome Theory instead of real Physics\nwas obvious.\nThe rest of your complaint is poorly\nconstructed ad hominem dribble and\nthat you criticize other people\u2019s work as\n\u201cpoorly written\u201d is laughable in light of\nyour letter.\nDeputy Editor,\nKadhim Shubber\nDear felix,\nI am disgusted by the likeness Mr\nShubber draws between Business\nSchool students and 12-year olds in his\narticle of February 6th.\nPerhaps he is envious of the significant funding attracted by the Business\nSchool, the landmark Lord Foster archi-tecture, or (and perhaps this is more on\nhis rung of the ladder) the beer and wine\noffered by the Tanaka Building cafe.\nIt appears to be much more likely,\nhowever, that his fear of the unknown\nin fact leads he himself to be the 12-year old; intimidated by the older, more\nresponsible and well-dressed students\nthat make up the Business School, who\nstudy a subject completely outside the\ncomfort zone provided by the natural\nsciences.\nI also suggest that this infantilism\nmanifests itself in the comment \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if there were any Business\nSchool students there but I didn\u2019t see\nany Blackberrys\u201d, as it is only natural for\nsomeone of such immaturity to resent\na symbol of adult communication (al-though I would also assume that he will\nbe upgrading his cup-and-string device\nat some point in the near future...)\nI attach two previous exam papers. If\nthese are indeed pitched to the standard of an average 12-year old, I am sure\nthey will not take Mr Shubber much\ntime at all to complete.\nRegards,\nLauren\nDear Lauren,\nThe Tanaka Building caf\u00e9 serves wine\nand beer? Brb.\nDeputy Editor,\nKadhim Shubber\nP.S. I apologise for demeaning your\nacademic efforts. Those exam papers\nwere bloody difficult and anybody who\npassed those exams obviously possesses\nan impressive intellect.\nI\nn this dream I am sitting on a\ntrain, the district line I think,\nand I don\u2019t recognise where it\nis heading. Across from me sit\nthree men, familiar to me but\nI couldn\u2019t say who they are. Without\nwarning, they stand and head to the\nend of the carriage where they grab a\nmiddle-eastern man. They throw him\nto the floor and start kicking him in the\nface, all the while I sit watching, feeling\ncompelled to help the man but unable\nto move. The train stops at a station and\nI get out, changing to the next carriage.\nAs the violence continues I stand at the\nadjoining window and look through.\nWhat this dream means is open to a\nwide variety of interpretations. Many\nwould see the analogy with the conflict\nin the Gaza Strip: the middle-eastern\nman representing the beleaguered Palestinians. However, I see a more subtle\nexplanation. My inability to quell the\nviolence, my total impotence in the\ncarriage, reminded me of another story\nin the news, something that may have\npassed you by.\nThree weeks ago a boy, 15 years old,\nwas stabbed to death in East London.\nSeems like a familiar story. He was\nthe first teenager to die of knife crime\nthis year, his death echoing the terrible pattern of violence that plagued\nthe capital last year. In all, 28 teenagers died of knife wounds in London\nalone between January and December.\nThe media should be applauded for\nits publishing of articles and editorials on this issue, raising the profile of\na problem which only affects a small\nnumber of us. However, for exactly\nthis reason, the public seems to have\nbecome desensitised to what are some\nof the worse crimes committed in our\ntime. No child deserves to suffer at\nthe hands of such gratuitous violence,\nregardless of perceived affiliations to\n\u201cgang culture\u201d. I too started to switch\noff, developing a passivity similar to\nthat which I exhibited in my dream. I\nunderstand this is wrong. As a com-munity, something needs to be done to\ndispel the perception among teenagers\nthat knives present a solution to often\npetty problems.\nThe boy who died two weeks ago was\ncalled Steven Lewis. I didn\u2019t know him\nor his family. However the place where\nhe was attacked, fell and bled to death\nin a road outside a church in Plaistow,\nis more familiar. It is the place where\nmy parents were married, an area\nwhere I spent much of my childhood\nkicking footballs and generally making\na nuisance of myself. I\u2019m not going to\npaint a picture that growing up in East\nLondon was idyllic, far from it; there\nwere fights and scraps, vandalism and\ndissent, but never once was anyone I\nknew stabbed. No one even owned a\nknife. If you had an issue with some-one, you would fight and the winner\nwas \u201cproven correct\u201d. This may seem\nperverse to the more cultured among\nyou, but at least no one died. Back\nthen there weren\u2019t any gangs of \u201cferal\nyouths\u201d, as a certain politician recently\nput it, just groups of mates looking\nfor a bit of excitement. For these rea-sons, I find what happens in London\nnow to be completely alien to the city\nwhere I grew up. In the time between\nsomething has changed, the mentality of boys has been altered, and now\nterms like \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cturf-wars\u201d are\nthe norm in media reporting. We must\nremind ourselves this is Plaistow not\nCompton.\nYou may be quick to point the accusing finger at \u201cGangster-rap\u201d. However, it is easy to forget that it is not\nthe music that breaks the law but the\nboys who listen to it. By their interpretation and imitation, they may commit these crimes and this could well\nbe the problem. However, I am by no\nmeans encouraging the curtailment of\nfreedom of expression, Rap represents\na diversity in music that we should\nembrace. It is clear that what is necessary is renewed communication with\nthe disaffected youth who look to Rap\nfor answers to their problems. It is my\nopinion that youth knife crime can be\nreduced by direct engagement with\nteenage boys. It must be communicated that when an artist writes about\nbeing attacked, shot, stabbed, they are\nnot endorsing the action, but warning\npeople from it. As anyone can sympa-thise, teenagers all suffer at one stage\nfrom the bruising of egos as they make\nmistakes and learn important life les-sons. Perhaps it\u2019s through gangs and\nknives they find a way of earning \u201crespect\u201d and minimising embarrassment\nwhen disputes arise. Yet it must be emphasised that if youths understand in\nclear, and probably graphic terms, that\nknives are tools of cowards and should\nbe shunned, we can avoid patronising\nand deflating the fragile egos of the\nyouths involved.\nI find it likely that it is the media who\nplayed the main role in changing the\nstreets of my youth to the gangland\nthat seems to exist today. Messages\nfrom music and culture in general have\nbeen misunderstood and distorted\nleading to the problem we see today.\nA new message must be communicated now, to remedy this and end the\nsenseless killing of the city\u2019s youth. It is\na hard task, something I admit I have\ninsufficiently addressed in this article.\nBut through dialogue and affirming\nthe right values, whilst maintaining\nthe egos of the young men at risk, it\nis possible for the spree of killings we\nhave witnessed to no longer need be\nignored.\nHow responsible is rap culture for youth gang culture?\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

(Aww...)\nAlthough obviously the real reason\nI\u2019m here is that I just want first dibs on\nguestlist passes and promo CDs, plus I\nwould also like to finally have one extra\n-curricular activity on my mostly barren CV.\nThe music section is mostly comprised of things that you submit, if you\nwant to review a gig you\u2019ve been to or\nwrite an opinion piece on the decline\nof \u201creal music\u201d or anything like that,\nemail us.

So\nI am going to use this space wisely. I\nwant to warn you of a subcultural men-ace, a reminder that the Darwinian\nprinciples of natural selection does not\napply to humans and that the weakest,\nstupidest, most pathetic of our species\nare among us and prospering. Most\nrecently they struck last Friday when\na swarm of them appeared without\nwarning at Liverpool Street tube sta-tion.

In\nreality, everyone on the planet is aware\nof these things, I think there was even\none on a CSI episode once. Imagine being a banker in the city, having worked\nall day in a job that you are holding\nonto by the thinnest of threads, finally\ngetting to go home, only to be stopped\nand miss your train due to 12,000 people all dancing in silence wearing ipods\n(something that looks ridiculous at the\nbest of times) and looking at you with\na smug sense of selfish satisfaction that\nthey ruined your day and are \u201cmessing\nwith the system\u201d.

Obviously\nthere were a multitude of\nevents, some trivial, others historic, but two have been on my\nmind. First event; provincial elections\nwere held in Iraq, my country of birth,\nwithout disruption or death. I don\u2019t\nthink you will begrudge me if I label this\nevent historic. Second event; I received\nan Iraqi passport, \u2018brand new\u2019 but all\nthe same carrying the wear and tear of\na nation struggling to regain its feet (not\nto mention the fact that my name was\nspelt wrong, Henry Marsden indeed my\nname isn\u2019t \u2018Kadhim Shubber\u2019\n, it\u2019s plainly\nmisspelt on my passport \u2018Khadhim\u2019).\nBut that slight matter aside, it would\nseem that these two events have coincided and conspired to give my mother\nammunition in her fight to persuade\nme to travel back to Iraq. The issue\nhas cropped up from time to time and\nthe combined retorts of \u201cI don\u2019t want\nto be asked awkward questions about\nthe Iraqi customs stamp in my British\npassport when I travel to the U.S.\u201d and\n\u201cFOR THE LOVE OF GOD, I DON\u2019T\nWANT TO DIE!!!\u201d usually admonished\nher sufficiently to drop the subject.\nNow you see my dilemma, the untimely coincidence of luck, democracy and\ndirect flights from London to Baghdad\n(oh and some stuff like \u2018the \u2018surge\u2019 or\nthe Sunni awakening or something like\nthat) have neutralized my arguments.\nShouldn\u2019t I want to return to the\ncountry of my birth? I still have family living in Baghdad and Erbil (in the\nKurdish north) and although many of\nthem fled after the American invasion\nin 2003 (I should know, I helped them\nwrite the letters, visa applications and\npersonal statements that gave them\nsomewhere to go) there are still many\nShubber family members to meet and\ngreet. My mother and perhaps to an\nextent my father (who didn\u2019t spend\na great deal of time \u2018living\u2019 in Iraq,\nhis youth spent in an English boarding school and then a large portion of\nthe 80s serving as a medic in the Iraqi\narmy) envisage a sort of homecoming;\nan opportunity for me to reconnect\nwith my ancestral roots.\nBut the regrettably still dangerous\ntrip to Baghdad, to the Dora area, to\nthe house backing onto the River Tigris\nwhere my family spent a few hopeful\nyears before the punishing bombs of\nthe first Gulf War began to fall, could\nnever feel like a homecoming for me.\nBelonging is surely a comforting feeling but, at least geographically and\nnationally, I have never felt the warm\nsupport of belonging. I am ethnically\nan Arab, but I have never felt kinship\nwith other Arabs and my Iraqi nationality has never been more than a back-story. I grew up in Northern Ireland,\nbut I was always sufficiently different,\nsufficiently tanned and sufficiently\nnot Protestant or Catholic to truly\nfeel Northern Irish (not that there are\nmany people who feel \u2018Northern Irish\u2019,\nmost choose instead Irish or British\nand I couldn\u2019t lay a claim to either with\na straight face). I was born Muslim but\nthe only crowd that I might belong to\nas a result of this are hypocrites; I fast\neach year during Ramadan but pass me\na shoe, four shots of Jaegermeister and\na pint of Guinness and my faux piety\nwill be exposed. Now my family lives\nin Eastbourne, on the South coast of\nEngland. This small town is a home but\nthen I will always be drawn towards my\nfamily regardless of their location.\nSo neither English, nor Irish or British and only nominally Iraqi and Muslim; what then should we think of the\nman without a home? There are two\nnatural directions we might move off\nin from here, either a glorious denunciation of the nationstate or a pathetic\nplea for citizenship of a suitable country (the Editor tells me that I would\nmake a good Serbian). But in truth and\nin summation, it couldn\u2019t matter less\nto me. I know of people who would\n\u2018die for their country\u2019 and perhaps\nkill; neither dying nor killing hold any\nappeal for me, and so I regard myself\nlucky for not having a country. I have\nnever found any benefit in nationalistic\npride and I haven\u2019t felt shortchanged\nfor not having it. I imagine that it will\nbe strange to tell my parents that I reject the nationality that they bestowed\nupon me. I imagine my mother will\nnot be happy (she\u2019s Kurdish and Kurds\nare very patriotic, try for yourself, tell\na Kurd that a unified Iraq is the only\nway forward; I take no responsibility\nfor personal injury) but I think that\nsomething will prevent me from telling her. Ah yes, that voice in the back\nof my head shouting \u201cFOR THE LOVE\nOF GOD, I DON\u2019T WANT TO DIE!!!\u201d\nKadhim Shubber doesn\u2019t want to go \u2018home\u2019\nW\nhen did staying in\nthe library until the\nearly hours of the\nmorning constitute a satisfactory\nnight? Why do I now feel guilty about\nsurfing away weeks of my life on facebook and youtube? Why do I suddenly\nfeel compelled to do some sort of academic work? Where has all this fucking responsibility come from?\nThe daily questions I ask myself, and\nmost probably others, now and again.\nBetween these Scrubs-style moments\nof subconscience, I march on, not entirely comfortably, with my daily life as\na 2nd year.\nMany of the excitements of being at\nuniversity have shrivelled up with the\nunavoidable passing of time. The thrill\nof coming to university for the very\nfirst time, followed by the anxious-ness in meeting new people and living\naway from home. The vague sense of\nDan Wan\u2019s youth has given way to drudgery\n\u201cThe streets\nwhere I spent my\nteenagehood are\nchanging and I\u2019m\nresentful as they\nslip further from\nrecognition\u201d\n\u201cThe trip to my\nhome before the\nbombs of the Gulf\nWar began to fall\ncould never feel\nlike a homecoming\nfor me. \u201d\nAfonso Campos says something nice... eventually\n\u201c\u2018Gola shoes are\nthe true mark\nof the wannabe\nfashionista who\nfails epically at\nbeing cool\u201d\nIraqi passport Direct flight from London OMG I\u2019m in Baghdad!\n+ =\nregret after sleeping into the afternoon\nand missing a day\u2019s worth of lectures.\nThe huge sense of relief of not failing\nthe year, and then having a worry-free\nsummer with your mates from back\nhome. What about becoming a second\nyear, and finding your own house in\nLondon, having a \u2018housewarming\u2019 party and losing a wall in your new home.\nBut is Fulham my \u2018home\u2019, and Watford only my \u2018hometown\u2019? Why do I\nfeel like a visitor when I walk down my\nlocal high street, not being able to feel\nthe celestial hug of familiarity?\nThis all rained down on me when I\nwalked past what was Virgin Megastore. Its replacement was a derelict\ntwo floors within a bustling shopping\nmall; boarded up, with only a single\nZavvi \u201cClosing Down\u201d poster in a dark\nwindow, crestfallenly displaying its\npast identity. Further up, Woolworths,\nhome of questionable pick\u2019n\u2019mix now\njust a fa\u00e7ade of bare metal poles and\nchipboard sheets. Then, rows of smaller shops and newsagents no longer in\nbusiness.\nI have carved out this new world\nfor myself, which didn\u2019t even involve\nsome of the biggest stores in Watford\nfirstly, in the case of Virgin Megastore,\nchanging its name, and secondly, closing down.\nThe streets where I spent my teen-agehood are changing without me, and\nI\u2019m resentful as it slips further and further from recognition. I am still technically in my teenagehood at 19, but\nwhy are these minor changes of scenery (the same ones that I would have\nbeen excited about when I was 16) affecting me so detrimentally?\nI am a mere 20 miles from my \u2018hometown\u2019, and this fact only greatly expands\nthe guilt I feel about having been swept\naway by this new life in the City. All\nthat serves as a constant reminder of\nthe first 18 years of my life is my poor\npronunciation of any word containing\na double \u2018t\u2019 sound, and my desktop\nbackground of Watford FC winning the\nChampionship play-off final in 2006.\nI\u2019ve got to the point where I\u2019m facing up to my newfound responsibilities\nand worries. It is all self-inflicted and\nhence I cannot, and will not complain.\nI am the one that decided to take up\npositions within felix and stoic tv that\nwould pile on the stress as well as give\nme hours of enjoyment and company.\nNo one else forced me to pick the hardest humanities course there was avail-able. Most importantly, though, no\none else in the world is telling me to\nfeel like I should, and need, to do well\nfor myself. Telling me to get out of this\nUniversity with a CV that after read-ing, CEOs in years to come will state\nI that am a \u201cwell-rounded individual\u201d.\nSo it is only me who piles the pressure\nupon my own shoulders.\nIn a year, I\u2019ll probably be looking for a\njob, or at least something to pay off the\n25 grand I\u2019ve paid for this experience.\nBut I swear I was sitting in my Sixth\nForm common room in Watford with\nthe sole thought running through my\nmind, \u201cI wonder how many cottaging\nreferences I can make in this Ode To\nA Nightingale analysis essay?\u201d So when\nthe fuck did everything change?\nI\u2019m not sure anyone can answer that,\nbut I\u2019ve got to a stage within my three\nyear University experience that has\nfallen into a routine worthy of Groundhog Day. A routine though stressfully\nbusy, gives enough time for the mind\nto settle and reflect on the last year and\na half of my life.\nWhat I have felt this week is an inevitability for everyone. It will come\nin different forms at different times of\npeople\u2019s lives. Despite this reflection\nthough, I know I\u2019m still a Watford boy\nat heart, but one that\u2019s doing just about\nall right for himself.\nW\nhen you travel\nabroad, I take it\nyou are polite, respect local custom,\nventure to speak\nthe language once in a while to order\ncrappy local food, and attempt to feign\nsome sort of respect towards anyone with whom you might be in close\nquarters. I do, and so do most people\nwith that remarkable trait that is social\nawareness. Unfortunately a lot of my\nPortuguese countrymen, and Iberians\nin general do not.\nIt\u2019s like pure anarchy with the Portuguese and the Spanish. You never\nknow what novel way they will find to\ndisrupt your otherwise normal day. I\ndon\u2019t inherently dislike them; it\u2019s just\nthat many of them commit cardinal\nsins that make my skull rapidly collapse around my ever-expanding brain.\nThese sins come in behavioral and\naesthetic forms with several variations\nthat are situation dependent. I know it\nmay sound obnoxious and rude, but I\nswear I can tell an Iberian tourist a mile\naway. More often than not they are\nwearing brightly coloured Gola shoes\n(little known fact: Camden was set up\nwith the two exclusive purposes of selling Golas and eyebrow piercings to the\nIberians). These are the true mark of\nthe wannabe fashionista who fails epi-cally at anything resembling cool. The\nbad haircut syndrome is also typically\nIberian as documented extensively by\nreputable publications like National\nGeographic and The Onion. It can also\nbe guaranteed that if you see someone\nsporting a mullet with a dreadlock\nhanging out the back like a decomposing hair extension and an oversized\nbackpack, this someone has certainly\nbeen summoned from the relatively\nsmall Catolonian city of Lleida by the\nMinistry For The Preservation of Irritating Tourists. Perhaps the most irritating trait is that they walk backwards\non tube platforms while grunting loudly at each other. You need a keen eye\nto observe this crab-like movement,\nbut do look out for it next time you\nare in the tube and you are likely to be\nrewarded with a display of behaviour\nthat is bound to become etched in your\nmemory for perpetuity.\nNow, on to slash the Yanks.\nWhile American tourists do not get\non my nerves as much, I assume they\nget on yours so the following memoir\nmight be of satisfaction to read. I remember the instance when coming\nback from a delightful evening spent\nin the South Bank. I had had a most\npleasant dinner with friends followed\nby a sound play by Charlie Kaufman\nand the Coen brothers, narrated by a\nbunch of A-list celebrities and Meryl\nStreep. On the journey back home,\nan American girl decides to strike up\nconversation and mention that she is\nfrom Michigan. As a gesture of common courtesy my friend engaged in\nsome mindless conversation with said\ngirl and happened to disclose the supposedly unexciting fact that one of our\nvery close friends hailed from Michigan also. Nothing could have led me\nto foresee the now unsurprising words\nthat were about to come out of her\nmouth.\n\u201cOh, my, gawd! No effing way! Do\nyou know Dave?\u201d.\nOn hearing this, my friend proceeded\nto roundhouse kick her face in, like, totally casually.\nIt is not hard to avoid the insanity\nand the droves of unsightly tourists\nthough. All you need is some precious\nknowledge as now shared by yours\ntruly. The Armageddon is pretty much\nknown to be contained to the micro-state of awful Queensway. Unless\nyou\u2019re a pikey wanting to ice-skate at\n3pm on a Thursday, brandishing a bottle or a can of Blackthorn, there\u2019s really no reason why you should ever go\nthere. For some incredibly strange and\nodd reason they are attracted to that\ngeneral area and vicinity like football\nplayers are attracted to Louis Vuitton\nsuitcases. It is deranged and illogical,\nbut so true.\nIt\u2019s useless refuting existing empirical evidence. I have previously tried\nkeeping stereotypes from cursing my\ntroubled mind, but I have long given\nup on such ludicrous efforts. I would\nbe most pleased if this comment piece\nhad led me to some sort of epiphany or\ncontained some fable-like fundamental\nmaxim, but alas it does not.\nThe only thing that you may safely\nconclude from my nonsensical drivel is\nthat 1) I am Portuguese; 2) still slightly\nbitter that Spain is bigger and better; 3)\nUpset I never won a Green Card lot-tery; 4) wish I had been born Spanish\nor American.\nGilead Amit takes it upon himself to rewrite Disney\n\u201cIf Snow White and\nthe Seven Dwarves\nwere set in the\n21st Century, what\nwould the dwarves\nbe called?\u201d\nF\nor the past few weeks, as\nthose so favoured as to enjoy my company on a regular\nbasis will know, my mind has\nbeen occupied with a question of paramount importance. This\nunwonted intensity of thought has led\nmy forehead to resemble the carefully\nploughed acres of Gordon Ramsay\u2019s\nfrontal lobe, and has meant that my\nnails have been chewed clean to the\nwrist. The issue that has been causing\nthe cogs in my mind to revolve at these\nsuperluminary velocities is a simple\none. If the story of Snow White and\nthe Seven Dwarves were to be updated\nto the 21st Century, what would be appropriate names for the raven-haired\nbeauty\u2019s diminuitive companions?\nMuch head-scratching has followed,\nand after prolonged consultation with\nmy flatmate, my girlfriend and my lab\npartner, I was politely advised to give\nup searching and sit quietly in a padded room until the coloured spots faded from the inside of my eyeballs. After cajoling them into letting me have\na sheet of paper and a blunt pencil, I\nwas finally able to produce the following line-up: Sexy, Bitchy, Needy, Kinky,\nOCD, Sleazy and Chomsky.\nIn what could, if we extend the recognized and well-understood boundaries\ncurrently in place, be called my mind,\nthe appropriately-anagrammable OCD\nfills the tiny shoes of the genial, patriarchal Doc, while Chomsky would\nreplace the charismatic and loveable\nDopey. I somehow feel that the two\nshare the same wide-eyed innocence\nand the same joie de vivre, not to mention a similar firm grasp on reality.\nIf the popular fable were to be updat-ed, however, the setting would have to\nbe changed. No more hidden cottages\nor craggy cliffs: the story cries out for\na different location. My lengthy cogita-tionsfinallywashedmeupontheshores\nof the following conclusion: the tale of\nSnow White could best be told to a 21st\nCentury audience through the backdrop of the Big Brother household.\nIt is the perfect fit \u2013 one attractive\nwoman and seven men with amusing\nphysical idiosyncrasies attempting to\nlive together under the same roof. I see\nSexy and Kinky spending a great deal\nof time with Snow White in the Master Bedroom, with Sleazy occasionally sticking his head round the door\nto breathe heavily and salivate before\ndarting back in. Meanwhile, Needy and\nOCD curl up together for comfort on\nthe floor as Bitchy and Chomsky stride\naround the house making everyone feel\nuncomfortable and out of place.\nAs exciting as the show would be\n(and I gladly renounce all copyright\nclaims to any prospective producers),\nmy ultimate conclusion was this: no\nsuch update is necessary. The story\nof Snow White, as recounted through\nthe enchanted frames of Walt Disney\u2019s\n1937 classic, has survived the decades.\nI offer as evidence an evening last\nyear when I found myself in front of\na computer screen with two of my\nfriends, surfing YouTube with the wild\nintensity common to those of us who\ntread the midnight tightrope. The three\nof us, living up to our reputations as\nstudents, were in a particularly cynical\nmood. We sneered at the unelectable\noptimism of Senator Obama, mocked\nRichard Dawkins for his excessive\nmoderation and brutally unweaved\neach and every one of the idealistic\nmemories of youth.\n\u201cHow about that ridiculous scene in\nSnow White,\u201d I drawled. \u201cYou know,\nthat one where the animals are cleaning up the house.\u201d My companions\nsneered appreciatively.\n\u201cGod, that was revolting,\u201d said one.\n\u201cFind it for me \u2013 I want to see if it\u2019s as\nsaccharine as I remember.\u201d\nA few typing noises and mouse clicks\nbrought up a full screen version of that\nscene on our communal computer. We\nsat back in our chairs, prepared to raise\nour most damning eyebrows and Ha\nour most disparaging Has.\nThe scene began. At the sight of the\nfirst chipmunk putting away a teacup\nour iron resolve began to thaw. The deer\ncleaning the furniture with his tail saw\nmy haughty lip uncurl and the proud\nfurrows in my brow disappear. By the\ntimethesquirrelswerebrushingthedust\nunder the carpet and the stag was being\nused as a laundry stand, my companions\nwere whistling along to the tune as I\nwept uncontrollably at the keyboard.\nThe YouTube video played to its con-clusion, and the monitor threw its light\non three moist-eyed university students staring into the distance at their\nrediscovered childhood. Different\nchildhoods, obviously. A spot of syntactical license to ease the monotony.\nThat moment stands out in the album of my memory like a pop-up card.\nThe fact that three particuarly hardhearted students with artificially low\nsentiment barriers should melt so completely over a scene like that has given\nme an entirely new respect for Disney.\nOr Gisney \u2013 whichever spelling most\nclosely resembles the flamboyant capital letter that dominates the logo.\nI am a tremendous fan of Disney.\nOn alternate weekends I form part of\na secretive but well-meaning congregation of addicts who meet in obscure\ncorners of the city to exchange Disney\ntrivia and watch an occasional DVD.\nMeet us at Cannon Street Station on\nthe last Tuesday of every month, wearing a green chrysanthemum and carrying a copy of the Racing Express.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that if\nI were to compile a list of all the Disney\naficionados at Imperial it would easily\neclipse this piece in length as well as\nin originality and humorous content.\nEveryone is a Disney fan, and I challenge all naysayers to sit through any\nof the masterpieces from 1937 to 1996\nand not be simultaneously charmed,\nmoved, amused, delighted, and overwhelmed by your inner child (or chil-dren. Leave me alone \u2013 my syntactical\nlicense doesn\u2019t expire till 2012).\nOr if not, at least let me know which\ndwarves you think I left out.\n\n"

This is more than just\nan overpriced hotel lobby bar.\nFor one night I felt like I stepped into\nthe fabulous fashionista world, right\ninto the pages of style bible Vogue.\nThe night began, terribly, lost and\nlonely walking through the rain (cold\nrain) in Notting Hill. I had made every\neffort to style sleekly, aware this is a\nfashionista bar, and there could be rich\nand fabulous clientele. My delusional\ngrooming attempts were ruined by the\nrain. I looked decidedly more super-mental than supermodel.\nUpon arrival, I was greeted by the\ngood-looking and friendly staff, and\nseated in front of an open coal fire.\nInside, this probably is the chic bar of\nmy dreams. White walls, period glass\nchandeliers, coal fires and an eclectic\nselection of Boroque and Rococo style\nfurniture. In the corner, a colourful\ncurvy mosaic tile window frame, inspired by the famous Spanish Architect Antoni Gaudi. Soon cosy and dry,\nI melted into the happy and romantic\natmosphere. Bliss.\nNext; drinks. The cocktail menu at\nBeach Blanket Babylon was... amusingly extensive. The classics were well\nrepresented, but the eyebrow-raising\ncelebrity cocktails set them apart. The\nParis Hilton Classic Cocktail (\u00a312)\ncontains \u201ca sugar lump coated in Bitters & Remy Martin XO topped with\nChampagne\u201d. How apt!\nWe ordered the Apple Daiquiri and\nthe Natalia Vodinoska cocktail, named\nafter the famous supermodel. Both\nwere excellent quality cocktails, made\nwith fresh ingredients and top of the\nrange spirits. The quality was reflected in the price, in the region of \u00a39-12\neach. I have to say the service from the\nfriendly staff was excellent and we felt\nwe were getting value for money.\nThe antics of \u201cImperial Girl\u201d and her\nkind were a hot conversation topic that\nnight. So understandably, when the\npainfully large bill arrived, we laughed\nand began comical shuffling around in\nBeach Blanket Babylon HHHHH\n45 Ledbury Hill,\nNotting Hill Gate Tube\nBest: Service, style and\nsophistication\nWorst: So so so expensive\nCatherine Jones\nNightlife Editor\nGet a room!\nEugh!

My three-year-old ThinkPad had crashed a few\ntimes after my several attempts to run\nthe Windows Experience Index assess-ment, but apart from that I haven\u2019t had\nany problems at all on either laptops\n(no blue screen of death for sure!). In\nfact, on the MacBook Windows 7 runs\nalmost as smooth as OS X. It even\nwakes up straight away from standby,\nwhich before Windows 7 this was an\nOS-X-exclusive feature.\nMany reviewers complain that Windows 7 does not have enough new features to be qualified as a brand new OS,\nbut I beg to differ: given that Windows\n7 runs so much better than Vista with\nwhat it has right now, I wouldn\u2019t want\nany extra premature features to ruin\nits stability. However, I would agree\nthat Microsoft should make Windows\n7 cheaper than what we had paid for\nVista, to make up for the pain we suffered back in the early days. I say drop\nZune and use the remaining development money to give us all the discount\nwe deserve!\nI do have one confession to make: my\noriginal plan was to also test Windows\n7 on a netbook (an Acer Aspire One) in\nthis week\u2019s felix, but due to the heavy\nsnow last week the delivery is delayed,\nso I\u2019m afraid I will have to delay the test\ntill next week, provided that the netbook arrives before Wednesday. Until next time, why not try Windows 7\nyourself? Any machines released in the\nlast two years should work fine (check\nwith the list of minimum requirements\non the previous page). Intel-Mac users\nshould definitely try it just for fun!\nAre you using Windows 7? What is\nyour impression so far?

The\nonly update is the additional recent\ndocuments list for each application\n\u2013 same as the taskbar buttons really.\nAnother change is that the power button at the bottom right is now labelled\n\u201cShut Down\u201d by default, instead of a\nmisleading round circle that turns out\nto be standby in Vista. If you prefer\nVista\u2019s default setting, you can change\nthe button by simply right-clicking it,\n30 felix Friday 13 February 2009\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 Richard Lai\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFriday 13 February 2009 felix\nTechnology\nW\nhen Windows Vista\nfirst came out back\nin November 2006,\nI thought, \u201cWow!\n(sic) At last! Something that can fully replace the dull\nWindows XP.\u201d Unfortunately, I was\nwrong: not only did the first release\nof Vista consume too much system\nresources, but the manufacturers also\nfailed to deliver compatible drivers for\nhopeful upgraders, thus rendering the\n\u201cVista Capable\u201d labels meaningless.\nToday, Vista is a lot more stable with\nService Pack 1 (and personally I am enjoying the ride too), but many consumers are so afraid of Redmond\u2019s obese\nOS, that they\u2019d rather go through all\nthe trouble to downgrade their new\ncomputers to XP. If you are one such\nperson, then you should read on to find\nout why Windows 7 will be different.\nWindows 7: Vista on diet\nEagle-eyed readers may have already\nnoticed that Windows 7\u2019s full version\nnumber is 6.1.7xxx, meaning it is based\non Windows Vista (6.0.6xxx). This\ntraces back to the changes Microsoft\nmade to their OS roadmap, when they\nhad to focus on patching Windows\nXP\u2019s major security vulnerabilities in\n2003, thus splitting the originally-sin-gle OS release into two parts. Perhaps\nit was also this rush that made Vista a\nbadly polished product, so Windows 7\nis given the big task to regain consumers\u2019 trust for Microsoft.\nIn fact, Microsoft\u2019s recent public release of Windows 7\u2019s beta (Build 7000)\nhas already impressed many critics, most\npraising the smaller memory footprint\ncompared to Vista. Other notable improvements include the optimized task-bar, smarter windows management, less\nannoying notifications etc.\nFrom XP to 7: cannot upgrade\nMy first testing platform was a Lenovo\nThinkPad X41 Tablet \u2013 a three-year-old laptop that has the rare touchscreen\nfeature, perfect for testing Windows\n7\u2019s compatibility and its tablet func-tion. To keep the test fair, I installed a\nvanilla-copy of XP Tablet PC Edition\n2005 SP3 along with the essential drivers (no Lenovo crapware apart from\ntheir \u201cSystem Update\u201d tool), and then\nthe same was done with Windows 7.\nAs expected, Windows 7 did not allow\na direct upgrade from XP; you can only\ndo so with Windows Vista SP1, so be\nwarned!\nInstallation was a breeze overall - the\nonly user inputs required all took place\nat the beginning, and then just half\nan hour later I had the new OS running (but with missing drivers). Once\nthe drivers were loaded, Windows 7\nstill had a pretty impressive boot time\n(from power on to appearance of desk-top) of 1 minute 31 seconds, just 9 seconds more than XP.\nSmarter taskbar\nUpon first login, you may not be impressed by the same eye candy seen in\nVista, but do bear in mind that this is\nstill a beta release so the graphics may\nnot be final. However, what caught\nmy attention first was the revamped\ntaskbar: it is now thicker, and by default there are already three buttons\ndocked. At first I thought they were\njust ordinary quick launch buttons, but\nwith a bit of fiddling, I discovered that\ndragging the buttons upwards reveals\na menu, showing shortcuts for the relevant programs (this is a \u201cJump List\u201d),\noption to \u201cpin\u201d a shortcut to the top\nof the list, and shortcuts to web book-marks, recent documents and playlists,\nif supported.\nIn fact, the above features also apply\nto any docked buttons on the taskbar,\nso if you open any applications, their\ntaskbar button will always have a list\nof recent documents, and you can also\npin a shortcut. This effectively turns\nthe ordinary Windows taskbar into a\nbeastly cousin of Mac OS X\u2019s dock.\nHowever, since the ThinkPad\u2019s\ngraphics chip is not powerful enough,\nWindows 7 has automatically disabled\nthe more advanced Aero features (in\nshort: the fancy graphics as seen in\nVista). This is why I prepared a second\nmachine to play with: my lovely unibody MacBook.\nAgain, installation was very straight\nforward using Boot Camp, and all the\nVista drivers on Apple\u2019s DVD worked\nstraight away. Now the taskbar buttons\nshow a preview panel when clicked on,\nand you can hover over each thumbnail\nto highlight the associated window,\nwhile the other under the stack become transparent. Pretty cool, eh? Of\ncourse, clicking on the thumbnail will\nbring you that window to the front.\nOn the right hand side of the taskbar\nare the usual notification and system\nmonitor icons (power, network and\nvolume), but now with an additional\nflag icon which reveals an \u201cAction\nCenter\u201d box - a neat replacement of the\nold intrusive balloons which are much\nhated by XP and Vista users. Other\napplication icons can be revealed by\nclicking on the triangle to the left of the\nWindows 7 - hope or flop for M$?\nRichard Lai test drives Microsoft\u2019s latest beta OS on different machines, to see if it is better than Vista\nSteve Ballmer and Steve Jobs may not be friends on Facebook, but Apple will employ their lawyers to poke Microsoft if they are not careful.\nHighlights:\nSmaller memory footprint\n\u2022\nOptimized taskbar\n\u2022\nMuch-improved tools\n\u2022\n(Paint, WordPad, etc.)\nSmart windows tiling\n\u2022\nAero Shake and Aero\n\u2022\nPeek\nOptimized for SSDs\n\u2022\nBeta minimum requirements:\nCPU: 1GHz (32- or 64-bit)\n\u2022\nRAM: 1GB\n\u2022\nHDD: 16GB of free space\n\u2022\nDirectX 9 graphics card\n\u2022\nwith 128MB memory\nDVD burner\n\u2022\nInternet access\n\u2022\nRetail editions:\nStarter\n\u2022\nHome Basic\n\u2022\nHome Premium\n\u2022\nProfessional\n\u2022\nEnterprise\n\u2022\nUltimate\n\u2022\nRelease: as early as July 2009\nWin7 Trivia\nBoot screen of Windows 7\nA Jump List above the taskbar\nflag, and you can still customize them\nto make them appear in the icon area\ninstead of just the notification box.\nSince the taskbar is now thicker, the\nclock now conveniently shows both\nthe time and date, unlike the old days\nwhen you had to hover over the clock\nto show the date (which disappears after five seconds). Further right sits a\nblank, thin button which simply does\n\u201cShow desktop\u201d. This button used to be\nin the \u201cQuick Launch\u201d list right next to\nthe Start Menu, so some may struggle\nto get used to this new layout.\nAction Center with notifications Start Menu now with a clearly labelled power button (circled)\nWith Aero enabled, clicking a docked button reveals a preview panel,\nand hovering over a thumbnail highlights the associated window.\nand the button\u2019s label will change to\nwhatever action you choose.\nThemes and Gadgets\nWho doesn\u2019t personalise their desktop these days? To satisfy the general\nusers, Windows 7 will come with a\nmore powerful theme tool that allows\nyou to package several wallpapers into\none option, so that Windows can automatically cycle through them at set\nintervals.\nOn the Gadgets front, Windows 7\nhas abandoned the sidebar approach\nin Vista, once again igniting the Windows-copied-OS-X flamewar (in OS\nX, Widgets are spread across the desk-top). To be honest, I couldn\u2019t care less:\nin Vista I only look at the Gadgets during login, so most of the time the Sidebar is hidden behind a stack of Windows anyway.\nRevved-up Tools\nMicrosoft has finally decided to give a\nlittle bit of extra with Windows\u2019 built-in tools. Kids and bored secretaries\nwill be most impressed by the new\nPaint, which now includes a selection\nof shapes and brushes. The new interface took cues from Office 2007, making Paint easier to use than previous\nversions. Another tweak worth mentioning is that Paint will automatically\nresize the canvas to fit your pasted\nimage, amking screenshot capturing\nmuch easier (just as I had been experiencing while writing this article).\nSimilarly, WordPad has also been\nupdated with a Word-2007-esque in-terface, and you can even edit .docx\ndocuments (Word 2007 file format)\nbut understandably losing some for-matting. It also has Paint built-in, so\nyou can edit your inserted drawing at\nany time.\nOne feature that is ignored by most\nusers is Windows\u2019 handwriting recog-nition, which is why I was very keen to\ntry Windows 7 on the ThinkPad X41\nTablet. Compared to Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, Windows 7 is definitely better at reading my handwriting\nas expected. Furthermore, Windows 7\nwill recognize at least six more languages on top of Vista\u2019s twelve.\nNetworking\nIt took me a while to figure out where\nto make a Virtual Personal Network\nconnection to Imperial College - with\nVista I could do so in the Start Menu,\nbut Windows 7 has moved it all to the\nnetwork icon on the right hand side of\nthe taskbar, which is slightly more con-venient. On a higher level, the main\nnetworking feature of Windows 7 is\nHomeGroup, a protocol that is meant\nto simplify how we \u201cshare files, photos,\nmusic, and printers throughout your\nWindows 7 Paint + Tablet PC = awesomeness + super fun time!\nWordPad has a Word-2007-esque interface and can edit .docx files\nImpressive handwriting recognition in Windows 7\nhome\u201d using just one shared password.\nIn fact, the real stars of this feature are\n\u201clibraries\u201d - essentially \u201ca way to aggregate multiple physical locations on\na computer into one unified view\u201d, as\ndescribed by Jerry (e7blog) on blogs.\nmsdn.com.\nIn other words, say if you have three\nWindows 7 computers on your home\nnetwork, then you can set up your\nHomeGroup to view all photos of the\nentire network within one folder on any\nmachine, rather than having to browse\nthrough several network folders for\ndifferent machines. Of course, you can\nvary your folders\u2019 individual privacy\nlevels and read/write permissions.\nEasy media browsing within a\nHomeGroup is supported by the forthcoming Windows Media Player 12 and\nWindows Media Center: rather than\nscanning \u201cthe entire hard drive on the\ncomputer to find media files and add\nthem into a media library\u201d, they simply\nuse the Windows Explorer libraries as\nshared by both apps.\nAuto-resizing windows\nThis feature should have been included\nin Windows a long time ago, but it has\nonly been implemented by third-party\napps until now: by dragging a window\nto the left or right edge of the screen,\nWindows 7 will automatically resize it\nto fill up that half-side of the screen,\nand dragging to the top edge will maximise it. You can also do the same by\nusing a combination of the Windows\nkey and one of the arrow keys (the\ndown key restores/minimises the win-dow). No more fiddly window-resizing\nwork for you!\nBits and bobs\nThe keyboard shortcuts mentioned\nabove are just four of many available\nin Windows 7, and most are quite easy\nChoosing which libraries you would like to share within a HomeGroup\nEasier network connection\nThemes in Windows 7 can cycle through wallpapers automatically\n\n"

By the end\nof the evening they\u2019d charmed the\ncrowd sufficiently for one audience member to send: \u201cI want you\nto marry my daughter. Meet me at\nSouth Tooting Temple.\u201d\nAside from thoroughly entertaining presenters, the evening\nprovided a mixture of dance and\nmusic, a lot of which seamlessley\ncombined the traditional and the\nmodern, including a performance by Mega Melodies, who performed modern music on some\ncrazy-looking traditional instruments to great effect.\nAnother more traditional performance was Inisai Mazhai sung\nby Hari Sanker and followed by\na short fashion show, with sarees\ndonated by Casipillai Designs.\nThough the evening was generally light-hearted, often quirky,\nentertainment, there was a serious\nmessage behind the event: Every\nyear Mega Maalai is held in order\nto raise money for charities; this\nyear\u2019s charities were particularly\nclose to Tamil Society\u2019s hearts as\nthey were raising money for two\nnon-political charities working\nto help those in majority Tamil\nareas of the North and East of\nSri-Lanka. These areas have suffered through cyclone-related\nfloods and civil war, with\nany recovery hampered by\naid not being allowed into\nthese areas, or being too\ndangerous for aid workers to\ntravel to.\nAfter some time of reflection\nabout why we were there, and\nsome speeches on behalf\nthe charities being sup-ported, it was back to the\nentertainment:\nThe cute award of the\nevening goes to a lovely performance from the\nFeltham dance company juniors, which\ninvolved on of the\nsmallest girls I\u2019ve ever\nseen move in-time to\nmusic, doing a very good\njob of keeping up with the older\ngirls.\nAnother high point was\nRadio Funkology, who\ngave a\nquirky twist to\ntheir dance routine by using a\nghetto blaster and an mp3 player\nas a prop and having one of the\ndancers pretend to flick through\ntracks on his mp3 player. Using this gimmick they managed\nto work dozens of songs into a\nfew minutes of dance; ranging\nfrom the funky \u2018Dangerous\u2019 from\nMichael Jackson to \u2018My Humps\u2019\nvia \u2018Backstreets Back\u2019!\nThe penultamate performance\nwas a medley of dances, one of\nwhich, called \u2018Gaana\u2019, is performed in vibrant costumes, with\nbig, billowing skirts. Gaya Gayathrithis Rajasooriar, one of the\nperformers, told felix: \u201cGaana\u2019 is\nan upbeat style of dance with big\nmovements and a lot of energy. It\nwas originally performed by people who had laborious jobs, but is\nnow mainly done as performances in movies and shows. Gaana is\nspecific to Tamils as Bhangra is to\nPunjabis.\u201d\nThe finally of the evening involved the majority of the evenings performers joining in a\nbig performance, loosely based\naround a battle , with some big\ngroup movements and excellent\nindividual performances, including one break-dancer who did an\namazing move where he dropped\nonto one knee, at a speed that I\u2019m\nsure would have shattered my\nknee caps!\nIn all, the evening was one of\nfun and entertainment, backed\nup by a serious message,\nraising money for a charitable cause. All that\u2019s\nleft to mention is the\nparticularly amusing parting words\nof the present-ers: \u2018If we\u2019re here\nnext year, it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t\ngot jobs yet!\u2019.\nE\nach year the International Tamil Sociey selects charities to\nsupport with their fundraising events, this year they have\nchosen to support non-political organisations that work\nin Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. Predominantly Tamil\nin population, these areas have suffered through natural\nand man-made disasters.\nGayathrithis Rajasooriar told felix: \u201cThis is all to raise money\nfor charity. We\u2019re supporting Save the Children, Tamils Health Organisation and TamilAid. The reason we\u2019re supporting two small,\nnon-political charities, that work in the north and east of Sri Lanka,\nis due to the fact that these predominantly Tamil areas have been\ndevastated by the recent cyclone-related floods and civil war and\naid is not allowed into the area so those caught up in the disaster\nrely on small agencies and connections.\n\u201cAt the moment, Tamil civilians are being murdered left and right.\nThere are fights between the Sri Lankan government and the main\nTamil rebel group LTTE that have gone on for over 25 years now.\nThis is the reason so many Sri Lankan Tamils now live in London,\nCanada,etc. There have been protests- there was one starting from\nPimlico on Saturday where over 100,000 people came and there\nwill be one outside the Sri Lankan embassy, on Sri Lankan independence day.\u201d\nThe society is called the International Tamil Society, as Tamils\n\u2022\ncan be from India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia to name but a few.\nAt Imperial, most of the committee consists of Sri Lankan\nTamils.\nMega Maalai has been running for 16 years. It originated in\n\u2022\nthe Great Hall of Imperial College and in 2003 took place at its\nfirst theatre (the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith)\nLast year, the event was held at the London Palladium, previ\u2022\nous venues have included Hammersmith Apollo and Hackney Empire.\nAll proceeds go to charity, which this year are Save the Chil\u2022\ndren, Tamil Aid and Tamils Health Organisation.\nSarees from the act with the singer Hari followed by a small\n\u2022\nfashion show were donated by Casipillai Designs- she has a\nfacebook page.\nJimmy Nathan is President of the International Tamil Society\n\u2022\nthis year, his moment in the spotlight came when he crept on\nto the stage to try and sweep glitter from it during the second\nhalf of the performance.\nA lot of other London Universities have Tamil Societies that\n\u2022\nhost similar shows. Some of the acts perform in all or many\nof the shows.\nMany of the acts are choreographed by professional danc\u2022\ners/teachers who do the show for free.\nAlice Rowlands reports on International Tamil Society\u2019s annual Mega Maalai celebration and\nfundraiser with photographs courtesy of Ben Waran\nCharities supported by Mega Maalai\n\u201cRaising money for\ntwo non-political\ncharities working\nto help people\nin majority Tamil\nareas of the North\nand East of SriLanka.\u201d\n\u201cIf we\u2019re here next\nyear, it\u2019s because\nwe haven\u2019t got jobs\nyet!\u2019\u201d\nFun facts about Mega Maalai\nThank you to\nGayathrithis\nRajasooriar\nfor help with\nquotes, facts and\ninviting felix to\nthe show.\n\n"

Like a few of his predecessors, Sir Roy was a student\nhimself at Imperial back in 1960\u2019s, and felix asked Sir Roy\nwhat it was like back then and about the changes that have\noccurred since. As he points out, Jovan Nedi\u0107 and Tom\nRoberts are no John Humphrys or Jeremy Paxmans, but we\ngave it our best shot!\nThe Union and other facilities\nfelix\nDuring your recent visit to the Union, you were heard saying that the Union Bar is exactly as you\nremember it. What are your views on the rest of the building?\nRector\nIt\u2019s extraordinary about the Union Bar, almost as if it hasn\u2019t been touched! But the rest of the building is jaded, however the office space is improved. I hear that work is being done on the gym, which\nwas a dreadful place back in my time with very primitive equipment. Now we have Ethos which is the\nbest university sports centre I\u2019ve seen, better than most of the ones professional sports club have in\nLondon.\nfelix\nWill Ethos remain free then next year?\nRector\nYes of course. The local residence fees are not fixed, and the objectives are then a sensible business\ndecision as you\u2019ve created a world class facility that will attract local residence who will pay significant\nsums of money to be a member of that club, so you then use then support the club on the basis of that\nincome which then makes it free to students.\nHis time as a student\nRector\nI arrived in October to stay in Falmouth Hall to study Zoology. Imperial was a very different place back\nthen, number one. The student and staff population were predominantly UK and coming back to this\ncampus, what strikes me now is how hugely international the place is, and also how much the gender\nbalance has changed which is mainly due to the medical school, but even in subjects such as engineering the number of females has increased.\nBut I think also the social side is a lot more sophisticated than it used to be. In my student days, and\nthis may reflect hugely on me more than anything else, but it was about bars and it was the Union Bar\npredominantly. I was a very keen rugby player, as well as athletics, but rugby took out most of my week,\nwith Monday evening, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday lunchtime and Saturday afternoon all taken up\nby it. We also had a fixture list that included teams who were 1sts or 2nds from the top London clubs,\nsuch as London Irish and London Welsh, so it was a very good fixture list. We used to put out 10 teams\na week and postgraduates were recruited in certain departments for their rugby ability.\nfelix\nSo back then they did have a similar scheme to what Oxford and Cambridge have now, where they\nbring in players for various sports?\nRector\nIt wasn\u2019t quite as crude as that. They had to have the academic qualifications first before they could\nplay. But the other club that I was highly involved in was with the exploration society who organised\ntrips to the Amazon and such like.\nNow the social side, because the gender balance was so horrendous, it very much involved going to\none of the other colleges. Queen Elizabeth\u2019s College was up in Kensington at the time that had a much\ngreater proportion of female students than at Imperial back then, so the social life was much better\noutside the College than in, unless of course you were part of one of the sports teams. What strikes me\nnow are the vast number of clubs and societies that are available, much more than in my day.\nThe changing face of Imperial\nCollege and Accommodation\nfelix\nYou have already mentioned that when you came back to Imperial\nyou noticed a lot of change. What would you say is the biggest\nchange that has happened since your time?\nRector\nProbably the quality of the physical build and the environment. I\nthink Sir Richard and prior to that Lord Oxburgh, did a lot to have\nmajor new capitol build projects in term of Sir Alexander Fleming\nbuilding for example. And there is a very trivial reason why we are\nable to do that and that is the endowment fund that was set up.\nTouch wood, and with a bit of luck, we\u2019ll be able to sustain the major\ncapitol builds through the current economic crisis.\nfelix\nEastside is due to finish next term, how is that going?\nRector\nWe are actually ahead of schedule. A lot of lessons were learnt from\nSouthside too.\nfelix\nAre the rent prices going to be in line with Southside then?\nRector\nThose decisions haven\u2019t been fully taken yet, but at the moment it\u2019s\non target for cost and should be finished ahead of schedule.\nfelix\nIs the accommodation going to be the same standard as Southside then?\nRector\nSlightly better.\nfelix\nSo you could say that there would then be a natural increase in\nprice?\nRector\nUmm no, don\u2019t lead me into that, I\u2019m too experienced with the press\nwith the likes of John Humphrys and Paxmans of this world. I don\u2019t\nyet, the decisions haven\u2019t been made and clearly the economic crisis and pressures on students will influence us.\nThe Rector and his legacy\nfelix\nEach Rector has managed to leave behind some legacy once they had finished. Your predecessor, Sir\nRichard Sykes, seemed to focus on the business side of things which saw the Imperial management\nstructure restructured as well as seeing Imperial rise to 5th in the world. However, student welfare\ntook a big hit with many commenting on the low student satisfaction levels every year. What do you\nplan to do to improve this?\nRector\nWell first of all let\u2019s look at the student satisfaction ratings as scientists. In a sample size of 180 and a\nstudent population of 12,000 using your knowledge of statistics would you believe that? It wasn\u2019t even\na random sample it was a submitted sample! So that survey that is done is probably meaningless. Now\nI\u2019ve spoken to Jenny Morgan about it, and what I hope I\u2019ve encouraged Jenny to do because we are\nvery happy to pay for that, is that I want a proper survey of Imperial students which is a large sample\nand have structured interviews as well as random questions so that we can find out how to improve\nthe student experience here. To be honest I think your experience is better than mine because the facilities you have here are better, the gymnasium is one example, but I also think of the library which is 24\nhours seven days a week, boy would I have liked that! I am committed to improving the quality of the\nstudent experience.\nWe are an international business, we are in the worlds top ten, and as one of those who are attracting\nthe world\u2019s best students we have to provide a facility that is of that quality. We\u2019re also in a nice bit of\nLondon too, with Hyde Park next door and museums within walking distance, it is a bit expensive, but\nit is a damn sight better then where the London School of Economics and University College London\nare. This place has the attractions that would rival Oxford and Cambridge easily in terms of theatres\nand museums and so on. So all that one needs to do is to focus on our local environment here, and try\nand make that as good as possible. You\u2019ve got to have a focus for the college, in by day it used to be\nBeit Quadrangle, but now it\u2019s around the Queen\u2019s Tower and I want to alter that whole environment to\nmake it much more student friendly. I want to put in incubator structures so that students can see the\ninterface between scientific knowledge and training and generating spin-off companies. So focusing on\nthis environment is a legacy that I want to leave behind, which such structures as the new \u00a3300 million\nFaculty of Engineering building.\nSecond issue, and this is a difficult one, in a sense that we are as good as the quality of our staff and\nstudents, on a research front we are as good as the quality of our staff and our postgraduate students,\nand one needs to make that a slightly less pressurised, more space environment to think an innovate.\nI\u2019m so conscious with my own career as well as other scientists, but having time to think where you\nare not constantly pressurised with performance matrix with such things as \u2018You\u2019ve got to get 10 papers published\u2019 or \u2018You need to get three research grants\u2019. So the only way we are going to rise up\nthe league table and displace Oxford and Cambridge is to focus on quality of the publications that we\nproduce. One of my tasks are to try and facilitate this.\nfelix\nSo would you say that you are actively seeking to climb above Oxford and Cambridge?\nRector\nOxford is certainly doable.\nfelix\nNot Cambridge?\nRector\nCambridge is very good. The reason we have a chance of doing it is a very odd one. Imperial\u2019s structure\nis very much like a business, when we decide to do something it is done and we can respond to external pressure much more rapidly. Oxford is a series of autonomous colleges with their own endowment,\nso if the college decides to do something and the college can\u2019t agree, no money can be spent.\nTo summarise your question of legacy, I would say: to improve the quality of the environment, to really\npay attention to the quality of the student experience, to create more time for our academic staff who\nare a real strength of this place and to be original and thoughts that nobody else has thought of with\nthe time and space to develop those ideas with the emphasis on quality not quantity. To enhance even\nfurther the spin out rate of biotechnology companies from Imperial because I do quite sincerely believe\nthat Britain coming out of this recession, you got to replace the financial services sector to a degree\nand biotechnology company generation is one of our major options. There are a lot of things that one\nwould like to do.\nFindoutnextweekwhatSirRoyAndersonreallythinks\nabout government spending policy on research and\ndevelopment. He also makes his views clear about\nfees at universities and we find out what he would\nlike Imperial\u2019s work to focus on in the future.

Use a fountain!\nRAG is awesome, but why bother?\nImperial College Union RAG Week\nis nearly upon us. RAG, standing for\nRaising and Giving is a traditional\nuniversity activity where by students\npartake in a variety of crazy activities\nto raise as much money as possible for\nchosen charities. This year the RAG\nteam has organised a range of activities\nand events so turn up get involved and\nhave some fun!\nRAG originates from the Victorian\nera when students took time from\ntheir studies to collect rags to clothe\nthe poor. It is also possible that the\nRAG collecters \u201cragged\u201d ie. badgered\nor pestered passers by until they made\na donation. From the old times to new\nthere is still the same question - why\ngive?\nHere I think the answer is that people should give money to charity because they can. As privileged people\nwho attend a top university, we have\nit easy; we\u2019re all employed, all housed\nand apart from that maths coursework\nsitting on your desk have relatively little to worry about.\nDespite the common publicised \u2018students have a difficult life\u2019 there are and\nwill be increasing more people who\nhave a much more difficult life. Think\nof the homeless man asking for change\nat the tube stop or the young child living with substance misusing parents.\nThese people find themselves a situation they find hard to change and are\noften blameless for. Charities are by\ntheir nature setup to deal with these\nsocial problems. They help to promote the work done by volunteers and\nprofessionals in a structured organisa-tion. These services cannot be found\nanywhere else. This is because they\nare not profitable and the government\ndoesn\u2019t deem them necessary. And yet\nthese services must be supported as\nthey help some of the most vulnerable\nmembers of society.\nDespite this need funding for the\nthird sector has decreased and according to the philanthropy website TheBigGive.com the funding deficit could\nreach \u00a32.3bn this year. While the recession doesn\u2019t mean that its the end of\nthe world for the charity sector, close\nto 2m people are now unemployed and\nwith Shelter recently reporting 75,000\npeople facing repossession the situation isn\u2019t great.\nSo people give because they can and\nI like to think everyone gets something\nback from their donations. Apart from\nthe warm fuzzy feeling, all donations\ndo make a difference. Charities have\nmuch lower overhead than businesses\nRAG Week is next week! RAG Chair, Jon Downing, tells felix about the charities, events and traditions.\nand are more likely to make a larger\nchange in the community. People\nchoosing to give something back is ultimately how communties thrive.\nIf you would like any more information or would like to take part as a volunteer please e-mail rag@ic.ac.uk\nOr, if you would like to nominate a\ncharity for next year visit the RAG\nwebsite (www.union.ic.ac.uk/rag) and\nfill in the form under the charities\nsection.\nJon Downing\nRAG Chair\nSlogan: none.\nWork remit: The Rainbow Trust Children\u2019s Charity provides practical and emotional support to families who\nhave a child with a life threatening or terminal illness. Each\nyear 1,000 families gain support.\nThey own two respite houses in Surrey and Northumberland which provide a break for the whole family, allowing them to spend precious time together as a family\naway from a hospital environment. The respite houses are\nwell equipped with play rooms and a swimming pool.\nIn addition Rainbow Trust\u2019s Family Support Workers\njoin the family in their own home and are there to provide\nwhatever practical support is needed. They may attend\nhospital appointments with parents, sit by the bedside of\nthe sick child to give parents a break and take worried siblings out for the day.\nIt costs \u00a33 million to keep the Rainbow Trust respite\nhouses open every year - a more than worth while cause.\nSlogan: \u2018Believe in the Children\u2019\nWork remit: The charity Barnardos initially started as an\norphanage run by Thomas Barnardo. He believed that\nchildren and young people should be free from poverty,\nabuse and discrimination. He pledged to support the\nabused, the vulnerable, the forgotten and the neglected,\nto stand up for them and bring out the best in each child.\nIn 1867 he started the Ragged shool and by the time he\ndied in 1905 the charity had 96 care home and cared for\n8,500 children.\nBarnardos today still have the same remit as when it\nstarted. They still work to support children in all sectors\nof society, currently running around 400 projects throughout the UK. These range from project dealing with child\npoverty, education and young careers to dealing with domestic violence and sexual abuse of children. The Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla Parker Bowles, is the president of\nBarnardos and acts a figurehead to the charity promoting\ntheir work throughout England.\nThe RAG Mag is a tradition of RAG Week hosting all manor of playful jokes and witty puns. Old \u2018retro\u2019 RAG Mags will be on throughout RAG Week with the real guy popping his head\nup a couple week later. Here you\u2019ll be able to find all the usual banter and long with a summary of how RAG Week went with photos. Send your RAG week photos to rag@ic.ac.uk.\nMean while keep yourself amused with some of these jokes:\nHow many students does it take to change a light bulb?\nImperial Students: Five. Two to design a nuclear powered bulb that never needs replacing, two to write the computer program that operates the switch and one to insert the bulb.\nNottingham: Don\u2019t change it. They shoot at lights round here, look at the last one.\nPlymouth: Six - One to change it and five to campaign to make lightbulb changing a new degree subject.\nCardiff: 5001 One to fit the bulb and five thousand to petition the government for the electrification of Wales.\nAdvice for leavers:\nYou don\u2019t get ideas for drinks from local tramps\nA \u00a33 bottle of wine is no longer \u201cpretty good stuff\u201d\n\u201cI just can\u2019t drink the way I used to\u201d replaces \u201cI\u2019m never going to drink that much again\u201d\nYou get out of bed in the morning even if its raining\nThe bank manager doesn\u2019t write you threatening letters\nInformative TV no longer includes Richard & Judy.\nMonday Night 16th: RCSU Ball\nWednesday 18th Daytime: RAG RAID\nWednesday 18th Evening\nFriday 20th Evening\nThe Royal College of Science is kicking off RAG with a charity ball\nat one of the worlds most exclusive night clubs, MAYA.

    "content": "12 felix Friday 13 February 2009\nFelix Whitton\nScience\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week, instead of trotting out\nsome half-arsed \u201cscience of love\u201d\nbullshit, we\u2019re going to delve into the\nmurky world of evolutionary psychol-ogy. Yes, this is the science that brings\nus ground-breaking new insights into\nhuman behaviour from looking at our\nevolutionary history.\nOr not. Because most of it, sadly, is\ncontentious, outdated and based on extrapolations from what our Pleistocene\nsavanna-dwelling ancestors might have\ndone. (This doesn\u2019t stop the press from\njumping on any story which purports\nto shed \u201cfascinating new insights\u201d into\nwhy humans wipe their arses a certain\nway).\nYou may have read on Monday about\nhow \u201cscience [has found] the secret of\na hot kiss\u201d (according to The Times).\nA new study from Lafayette College\nin Pennsylvania has shown that hormone levels change before and after\nkissing someone you love. Hold the\nfront page! More specifically, the team\ntested two hormones \u2013 cortisol, a\nstress hormone, and oxytocin, which\nhas been linked to social bonding. Unsurprisingly they found that kissing\nreduced cortisol levels in both sexes,\nand increased oxytocin (but only in\nmen).\nCue acres of newsprint devoted to\nthe wonders of kissing \u2013 from The\nTimes waxing lyrical about Shakespeare, to The Telegraph\u2019s more subdued revelation that according to a\n2007 British study, \u201cbrain and heart\nactivity sparked by passionate kissing\n[...] is less intense than the stimulation\nproduced by eating chocolate\u201d. All very\nwell, but hardly ground-breaking. The\nrather pitiful nature of the study (test-ed on a paltry 15 couples) is summed\nup by author Professor Wendy Hill;\n\u201cThis study shows kissing is much\nmore complex and causes hormonal\nchanges and things we never thought\noccurred.\u201d Well I never.\nA second piece of news which\nbrought a little joy into my life was a\nstudy published in the venerable journal Science linking colour to human\ncognition. The researchers found that\nred can enhance memory, and blue\ntriggers creativity. So, when faced with\na red screen students would think of\npractical used for a brick (building a\nhouse, for example), whereas a blue\nscreen would send them into fantasti-cal visions of paperweights and, best\nof all, \u201cpet scratching posts\u201d.\nOk, so I may be poking fun a little\nbit. After all, the research made it into\nScience, something I never have (and\nlikely never will). My gripe is with the\nsupposed academics who take these\nsimplistic findings and say things like,\nand I quote, \u201cRed is truly a good Valentine\u2019s colour, making men consider\nwomen more sexually attractive than\nother colours do.\u201d This from a Professor Andrew Elliot, a \u201cleader in the field\nof colour psychology\u201d.\nNow, let me stop you for a second\nhere. Read over that last quote again;\nThe nonsense behind\nthe science of human\nsexuality\nCan science really tell us anything useful about love and sexuality?\nThe eco-science column\nBiofuels have low green rating, but\nImperial shows support\nWind and solar energy are the most\nenvironmentally friendly alternative\nfuel options, whilst biofuel crops and\ncarbon capture may not be worth\nthe effort, according to Dr Mark Z.\nJacobson of Stanford University. His\nresearch, published in this month\u2019s Energy and Environmental Science jour-nal, coincides with the announcement\nof a new multimillion pound biofuel\ndevelopment project funded by the\nBiotechnology and Biological Sciences\nResearch Council (BBSRC), involving\nscientists from Imperial College.\nJacobson assessed each major alternative energy source, as if it were\nto power every vehicle in the US. He\nlooked at factors such as impact on\nglobal warming and human health,\nspace requirements and sustainability.\nThe winner in all areas was wind pow-er, which if used to run the entire US\nvehicle fleet, would reduce carbon and\nair pollution emissions by 99%. The\nvehicles would all be electric, therefore\nremoving exhaust pollution, saving\nover 15,000 lives a year from air pollution related deaths in the US alone.\nThe Stanford team estimated that an\narea of 3km squared would be enough\nland to contain all the wind turbines\nrequired.\nHowever, the rating system, the first\nquantitative, scientific evaluation of alternative energy sources, found biofu-els, nuclear power and coal with carbon\nAppearances can be deceiving \u2013 biofuels have a high environmental impact\ncapture to rank high on environmental\nimpact. Jacobson comments \u2018some\nenergy alternatives that have been proposed are just downright awful\u2019, and\nwith regards to biofuels he warns \u2018Ethanol-based biofuels will actually cause\nmore harm to human health, wildlife,\nwater supply and land use than current\nfossil fuels\u2019. He has calculated that the\nland required for enough biofuel to\npower the US vehicle fleet would be 30\ntimes that for wind turbines. Air pollution and carbon emissions would not\nbe cut substantially.\nMeanwhile, scientists from Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Life Sciences Department\nare part of a new venture for biofuel\ndevelopment, the Sustainable Bioenergy Centre. The BBSRC have just announced funding for the centre, which\nat \u00a327m is the biggest ever public investment in bioenergy. They believe\nbioenergy to be a significant source of\n\u2018clean, low carbon and secure energy\u2019\nand the biofuel sector has the potential to provide thousands of new \u2018green\ncollar\u2019 jobs.\nDr Thorsten Hamann is one of Imperial\u2019s scientists involved in the Centre,\nand has a different take on the feasibility of biofuels. He believes a mixture of\nenergy supplies is required to replace\nour current fossil fuel reliance, and\ncars cannot be run exclusively on wind\ngenerated electricity. \u2018Wind farms\nlook fantastic on paper, but I don\u2019t see\nthe potential to use wind to power the\nworld. We don\u2019t have the technology\nyet to power cars on electricity. Current electric cars have to be recharged\nevery night and the life-span of the\nbattery is unknown. We already have\nthe technology for biofuel run cars,\nand the infrastructure for a liquid fuel\ntransport system.\u2019\nAs for the space issue, he assures that\nthe biofuel plants developed by the\nSustainable Bioenergy Centre will be\nintended for land unsuitable for edible\ncrop agriculture. For the time being,\nour priority should be to move away\nfrom fossil fuels, and crop based fuels\nare \u2018significantly better\u2019, considering\nthey are a renewable source.\nDr Hamann believes in the distant\nfuture, electricity may be the solution\nto power transport, \u2018but for the next\n20 to 30 years, we are looking at liquid\nOlivia Sharp\nbased fuel.\u2019\nThe sustainable bioenergy centre is\na virtual collaboration between a large\nnumber of research institutions. The\nfocus is on generation of bioenergy and\ntransport biofuels from woody biomass and waste materials. Researchers\nwill assess the economic and environmental life cycle of potential biomass\nmaterials.\ndoes it seem an obvious link to the re-search? Or is it (and indulge my cynicism for one second here) perhaps due\nto a certain upcoming romantic \u2018holiday\u2019 and Prof Elliot\u2019s desire for some\nsneaky publicity? I\u2019ll let you decide...\nAnd to finish; listen, I implore you,\nto the latest Guardian Science Weekly\npodcast to have a good old chuckle at\na laughable evo-psychologist in action,\npromoting her new book about the\nstatistics behind love (quel chance!).\nEarth-shattering advice includes: Dating! Be yourself; Men! Ask questions\nand don\u2019t say anything sleazy; Women! Men prefer blondes because they\ncould spot them from afar back in\u2019t\ndays of yore; Sex! Yes, you guessed it,\nmen think about it a lot; Reader! Don\u2019t\nbuy the book.\n\n"
