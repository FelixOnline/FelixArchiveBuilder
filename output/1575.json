    "content": "23\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 09 MAY\nFILM\nDouble O dear...\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nThe Love Punch\nDirector: Joel Hopkins\nWriter: Joel Hopkins\nStarring: Pierce Brosnan, Emma\nThompson, Timothy Spall, Celia\nImrie\nRuntime: 94 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nThere is a line of dialogue that is rather unwisely repeated on a regular basis\nin The Love Punch. The film is quite\ninsistent on telling the audience that\na certain plan the characters come up\nwith is \u201ccrazy, daft, stupid, but brilliant\u201d. Aside from \u201cbrilliant\u201d, The Love\nPunch quite comfortably ticks the rest\nof the boxes: crazy, daft and stupid.\nA potentially effective screwball\nsetup quickly goes down the drain\nwith the film trying too hard, having\nfar too much utter nonsense, and not\nquite being funny enough despite contributions from plenty of English tal-ent. We open with an obvious nod to\nthe \u201cshaken not stirred\u201d motif of James\nBond, clearly an homage to its leading\nman; Brosnan, Pierce Brosnan. Richard (Brosnan) and his ex-wife Kate\n(Emma Thompson) are on civil(ish)\nterms in that they share a daughter\nand don\u2019t necessarily try to kill each\nother every time they run into one\nanother. A bad investment deal cheats\nthem out of their secure retirement\nsavings, and the only way to rightfully\ntake back what is theirs, is to travel to\nParis, France, crash a posh wedding,\nand steal an extremely rare diamond\nthen sell it for millions. The details,\nas you might expect, are never too\nimportant, given just how many holes\nthere are here in the first place.\nPerhaps something like this could\nhave worked on a goofy, over-the-top\nFrench adaptation. Here the Brit actors give it their all. And the chemistry\nbetween the suave, relaxed Brosnan\ngoes hand-in-hand with the more\nneurotic, louder Thompson. Not particularly imaginative ways of developing its characters, but between the\ntwo there are very few moments of humour that mostly amount to chuckles\nat most.\nOf course the big gag factor here is\nthat they\u2019re old and their bodies aren\u2019t\nquite what they used to be. They are\nfaced with a daunting challenge of\nhaving to do a lot of physical work.\n\u201cOld people doing exciting things\u201d\nseems to be a popular concept that\ngives room for veteran actors and\nactresses to let looseand have fun.\nWould we have seen Dame Helen\nMirren waving around a machine gun\nif \u201cRed\u201d had not happened? Instead we\nare treated to a very dull car chase, a\nnear-death experience that is nullified\nthrough something so anti-climatic,\nand the four thespians involved doing\na slow-motion walk in their sunglass-es, strutting their stuff, in a sequence\nthat painfully goes on for too long.\nYes, there are four of them in this\ngang. Richard and Kate\u2019s married\nbest friends Jerry (Timothy Spall) and\nPenelope (Celia Imrie) get on board\nwith this \u201ccrazy, daft, stupid, but brilliant\u201d plan. Various mishaps happen\nalong the way, none of them exciting\nor funny, a lot of it tedious and mind-numbingly boring.\nWhen the film is failing utterly at\ntrying to crack a few jokes, it sets out\nto become quite the relationship coun-sellor, trying to place into the script\nvarious monologues about what love\nis all about and how long-lasting relationships work. The fact that Richard\nand Kate are divorced, and are thrown\ninto this premise, should already give\nyou lots of hints as to what the writers are desperately getting at, somewhat of a better-late-than-never type\nof reunion; and such predictability is\nfine, although the way the film goes\nabout bringing the two back together\nis nothing short of cringe-worthy at\nbest.\nIt is such a waste of a talented cast:\neven with Spall\u2019s and Imrie\u2019s contri-butions, the gags turn flat. That goes\nto show how much of a problem the\nscript has in landing a single plausible joke. The heist itself is hugely un-remarkable, and when things briefly\ntake a turn for the more serious, even\nthat shift in tone is not enough to save\nthe film from having one disastrous\nthing happen one right after the other.\nThere are some nice sweeping shots\nof France. The ocean, the country-side, the nature; everything looks like\nsomething out of a fancy postcard,\nand the aerial shots do have a way of\ntrying to tempt a wave of potential\nsummer holiday-goers. But a 94-min-ute film is far too long to work purely\nas an expensive travel destination\nadvert, and even though the runtime\nis clearly no way near close to being\nsomething that is considered long,\nwith The Love Punch that feels like an\neternity for sure.\nA farcial comedy can work. Plenty of\nexamples in the past have shown that.\nBut the pure idiocy with which the\nfilm approaches its storytelling is insulting to those having to sit through\nit. There is a penis joke that works.\nYes, one of very few good moments\nthat bumps this up from a one-star\nrating to two.\n\n"

    "content": "10 FRIDAY 09 MAY\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nH\naving written about the\nUkraine when the events\nthere were all just kicking\noff, I feel it is about time to\nreturn to the topic. Then I wrote full\nof youthful enthusiasm but now I shall\nhave to take a more sober perspective.\nI could look at this (and to some extent\nI do) as a further sad confirmation\nthat a Luxemburgist spontaneous\nrevolution simply cannot deal with the\nThermidorean reaction. But Ukraine\nwas always a little more complicated:\nthere is a distinct lack of any sense of\n\u2018national\u2019 unity in the country, and\nwithout this most efficient of banners\nto mobilise behind, the student\nprotests in Kiev never really had any\nscope to advance beyond the modest\nmiddle-class movements which they\nwere.\nOf course, the reaction of the\n\u2018international community\u2019 \u2013 by\nwhich I mean the US and Western\nEurope \u2013 to the secession of Crimea\nhas been typically hypocritical. All\nof a sudden, governments which\nhad been falling over themselves to\ninsist that the Orwellian \u2018Right to\nProtect\u2019 transcends so petty a thing\nas national state sovereignty, have\nrediscovered the importance of, umm,\nwell, national state sovereignty... The\n\u2018international community\u2019 is aghast\nat this annexation which cost the\nlife of one soldier. Yet the Americans\nsupported the Indonesian \u2018annexation\u2019\nof East Timor, with a human cost of\nperhaps 200 thousand lives, mainly\ncivilian. Meanwhile, Brussels has\nremained obstinately mute about\nthe continued military presence of\nTurkey on Cyprus. It was the 1967\nland-grab which made Israel life-long\nfriends with the US, while settlements\ncontinue to be built illegally on\nPalestinian soil. Yet when Russia\nconducted a murderous campaign\nin Chechnya, Clinton congratulated\nPutin on the \u2018liberation of Grozny\u2019.\nThis hostility towards Putin is\nnew and very interesting. Russia\u2019s\nactions, after all, are clumsy but quite\nunderstandable (in the admittedly\nnarrow terms of geopolitics and\nIR). Russia is reacting to a quite real\neastward thrust amongst NATO\nmember states, and perhaps also sees\nrecent American impotence as a sign\nthat the US will not be capable of\nintervening, at least within Russia\u2019s\nown \u2018sphere of influence\u2019. Syria and\nEdward Snowden were perhaps test\ncases. The hostile reaction seems to\nbe a sign that US impotence is real.\nThis might just be another example\nof American paranoia, there has been\nplenty in the past, but it is undeniable\nthat after enjoying 25 years of global\nhegemony, the US can no longer boast\nthe same share of world economic and\nmilitary power it once had. It seems\nreasonable enough to assume that this\nwill eventually be reflected onto the\npolitical influence the US can wield,\nand I believe we have seen the seeds\nof this here.\nUkraine has had the misfortune to be\nthe stage on which these international\ntensions were played out. Ukraine is\nstill recovering from the disastrous\nshock therapy imposed upon it after\nindependence, and hardest hit was the\nindustrialised East, always closer to\nMoscow, economically and culturally,\nthan Kiev anyway. Politically,\nYanukovych never enjoyed the\nlegitimacy to make his Premiership\nsafe in a notoriously divided country,\nbut then the Orange revolutionaries\nonly distinguished themselves\nthrough their self-obsession and\nincompetence. This power vacuum\nhas sucked in Washington, Yatseniuk\nis clearly their \u2018man\u2019 \u2013 see the sinister\nconversation between Victoria\nNuland of the State Department and\nAmbassador Geoffrey Pyatt, available\non the BBC website, if you don\u2019t\nbelieve me \u2013 at the cost of Germany\u2019s\ninterests (ex-boxer Klitschko will not\nbe running for President), while Russia\nhas responded by pushing West.\nDefensive though Russia\u2019s actions\nhave been, the crudity with which they\nhave been carried out has had horrific\nconsequences for the people of\nUkraine. Ignoring for now the growth\nof the far right after the secession of\nCrimea, Yatseniuk\u2019s legitimacy has\ncertainly been improved by what is,\nfrom Kiev, a blatant act of aggression\non the part of Russia. Certainly\nthe secession of Crimea would not\nhave been possible without the 100\nthousand Russian troops stationed on\nthe border. Neither can Russia plead\ncompletely innocent for the ongoing\nviolence in Ukraine, though we should\nnote that the violence is both two-sided and in part a genuine expression\nof anti-Kiev sentiment, not purely a\nresult of Russian agitation as the Kyiv\nPost likes to make out.\nFinally, the IMF has now got its\nclaws into Ukraine with Yatseniuk\u2019s\ngovernment instituting the very same\neconomic policies which shrank\nUkraine\u2019s GDP to 50% of its Soviet\nlevel, increased corruption, created\na space for the Mafia and decreased\nlife expectancy. Events in the Ukraine\nhave been dramatic, and the deaths in\nOdessa are too sinister to be tragic,\nbut bad though the violence is, it will\nsoon end. Yet when the smoke clears\nwe may be left facing the rubble of\nanother neoliberal shock.\nUkraine Revisited\nChristy Kelly\nColumnist\n18.00 l 16 May l Hyde Park\nJOin One Big Thing\nfor a 5km sporting\nchallenge of your choice\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/sports/onebigthing\n5k any way challenge - walking l jogging l running\n\n"

What\nturns us from\njumping, frolicking children into aching, creaking\nOAPs? And could we ever stop this\nprocess?\nTwilight fans will be thrilled to hear\nthat the secret to immortality might\nreally lie in people\u2019s blood.\nNeural stem cells, the self-renew-ing, pluripotent cells that develop into\nthe different type of cells that make up\nthe nervous system, have been noted\nto decrease with age.\nThey are also located near the blood\nvessels in our brains so researchers\nthought that they might be receiving\nsignals, not only from the nervous\nsystem, but also from signaling factors\ncarried in the blood, and this may be\ninfluencing their decline.\nTo test this idea they joined the\nblood supplies of an old mouse (18\nmonths, apparently the equivalent of\n70 human years) and a young mouse\n(only 3 months) together, and found\nthat this boosted the number of neural stem cells in the older mouse, indicating that something in the young\nblood was stimulating their growth.\nThey then simply injected old mice\nwith blood plasma from young mice,\nand got similar results. Although it is\nimportant to bear in mind the sample\nsize was only 8, the results suggest the\nyoung blood had a significant effect\non cognition, with the old mice also\nperforming better on maze learning\nand memory tests. But whilst some\nresearchers are calling for clinical trials to see the effects on Alzheimer\u2019s,\nothers are cautioning that we need to\nidentify what these \u2018rejuvenating factors\u2019 are first and shouldn\u2019t get carried\naway.\nExcitingly, a team of researchers at\nHarvard think they have identified\none. It\u2019s a growth factor called GDF11,\nfound in our blood, and it\u2019s levels decrease as we age. On top of that, this\nprotein is identical in both mice and\nhumans, so any effects on the mice\nought to be similar in us.\nInjections of GDF11 have been\nshown to increase the number of\nblood vessels in our muscles, and to\nimprove the structure of older muscle\nfibres that become more disorganized\nwith age. This might explain why\nyoung blood appears to rejuvenate\nmuscle tissue and increase exercise\nendurance.\nThere are also suggestions that\nGDF11 reverses the effects of cardiac\nhypertrophy in old mice. This is a form\nof heart disease where the muscular\nwalls of the heart become stiff and less\nefficient at pumping our blood, and a\ncharacteristic of the disease is that the\nheart increases in size.\nAfter 10 weeks, the diseased hearts\nof older mice had shrunk considerably\nin size, suggesting the hypertrophy\nhad been reduced. However the\nmechanism behind the process is\nnot fully understood and there are\nstill many questions, for example\nwould the shrinking have continued\nindefinitely or levelled off at an\noptimum size?\nThis paper has also been criticised\nfor focusing mainly on heart size\nand not including other functional\nheart tests. However, it is certainly a\npromising start so watch this space for\npossible future heart therapies!\nAnother idea is that the effects of\nageing occur because the number and\nquality of our stem cells in various\ntissues declines. Stem cells are special\nbecause they can continuously renew\nthemselves, whilst also providing a\nsource of new cells for whichever\ntissue they are part of. For example,\nin our brain, neural stem cells will\nkeep dividing to renew or replace the\nneurons in our brain. So if our neural\nstem cells stop functioning with age,\nthis might explain why our cognitive\nfunctions decline.\nWhilst such research can potentially\noffer life-saving therapies, where is\nthe line between preventing age-associated diseases, and controlling\nour life cycle? We all want to grow old\ngracefully, but might this lead us to a\npoint where we don\u2019t grow old at all,\nand what other effects might this have\non society?\nOverall, we\u2019re still not sure exactly\nwhat causes us to age. Theories range\nfrom free radicals damaging our\ncells, to our telomeres running out.\n(Telomeres are excess bits of DNA\nat the end of our chromosomes that\nget shorter each time a cell divides).\nIn truth it\u2019s probably a complicated\ninteraction between pre-programmed\nbodily changes and our environment.\nBut what is clear is that age is a risk\nfactor for developing many other\ndiseases such as cancer, heart disease\nand Alzheimer\u2019s.\nIf we can understand the ageing\nprocess then we might be able to\nreduce the risk of developing these\ndiseases.\nsikhanswers.com\nStephanie Meyer called, she wants her sexual aphrodisiac back\n\n"

After\nrelieving myself of about 30kgs worth\nof newspaper at the hostel, I headed\non down to Nottingham Trent Union\n(NTU) to meet with my hosts and the\nother Felix rep (our estimable Editorelect).\nNTU is plush. Opened mere months\nago, this billion-dollar facility boasts\neverything you could ever need from\na union (in-house Costa anyone?).\nIndeed, if you like thinking 568 and\nMetric are \u2018ok\u2019 then I recommend you\nnever visit NTU.\nOur hosts were warm and\nwelcoming and we were soon chatting\nand sharing publication stories over\n\u00a32.75 Guinness\u2019.

Despite the\ndistinctly mediocre environs, we had\na roaringly good time getting to know\nsome of our fellow student editors.\nThe 9am Saturday morning start\nwasn\u2019t the best way to recover, but\nFelix are nothing if not hardy. There\nwere speeches from an eclectic bunch\nof journalists giving us an excellent\ninsight into both how a career in the\nfield can evolve as well as how to\nimprove our own publications. We\nfinally managed to rid ourselves of all\nthe Felixes at the swap-shop only to\nquickly regain the weight by picking\nup a diverse range of excellent student\npublications.\nFelix then decided to split so as to\ngive an official presence at both the\nnext sessions \u2013 a talk with the local\nrepresentativeoftheNationalUnionof\nJournalists (Diana Peasey) and a Q&A\nwith Nick Petrie of The Times.

This success is made all\nthe less bearable by the fact that he\nwas lovely guy who\u2019s impossible not to\nlike and who also does a huge amount\nto help out budding hacks (check out\nwannabehacks.co.uk). I managed\nto pose a Q relevant only to myself\n(journos with science backgrounds)\nwhich prompted a palpable collective\neye-roll from the others.\nWe then headed for an afternoon\ngroup-therapy session about our\nrespective unis and unions with James\nThornhill of The National Student.\nSome of the stories were truly horrific\ninvolving power-hungry sabs and\ndictatorial universities with the papers\ninvolved showing the kind of courage\nand fight that puts our protests against\nImperial West to shame.\nDue to another admin oversight,\nI had been unable to book two\nconsecutive nights at an establishment\nand thus needed to move to the\nClarence Hotel. Now, this is the point\nwhere I bestow upon you an important\nlife lesson \u2013 there is no official criteria\nfor calling yourself a hotel.\nArrival at the \u2018hotel\u2019 did not\nbode well. A sticker on the window\ninformed us that the place had once\nbeen \u201crated on Trip Advisor\u201d. It took\nthe \u2018manager\u2019 20 mins to find my\nkeys in a Fawlty Towers-esque mix\nup that culminated in us disturbing\nan amorous couple. After navigating\nmy way through corridors containing\n[presumably] broken bed frames, the\nroom did not disappoint. A quantity\nof plugs that suggested that the hotel\nwas scared I would run out of energy\nwas accompanied by lashings of stains.\nTo cap this, my bathroom was a 1m2\ncrime scene capped with a convenient\nmurder weapon/drug hole.\nHighlights from neighbouring\nrooms (Editor-elect and Cardiff\nUni) included plastic spoons for\ndoor handles (logical), wardrobes\nthat couldn\u2019t store clothes but could\nprovide multiple entrances to magical\nlands (exciting) and sinks that were\nnot connected to plumbing/mains\n(aesthetic). But hey, the beds were\nclean and doors were lock-ready.\nThe evening entertainment was\nan awards dinner followed by the\nNTU event Climax. Both were\nhighly enjoyable though I may have\noutstayed my welcome with the bar\nstaff by constantly asking them if they\ntook Euros.\nSuddenly, it was 9.45 in the morning\nand we were late for the Sunday\nmorning death session back at NTU.\nThankfully NTU is wonderful and\nhas a plethora of highly comfortable\nchairs. By not moving any of my core\nand ingesting a constant rate of fluids,\nI was just about able to concentrate.\nOur final guest speaker was tabloid\njournalist and writer William Coles \u2013\na fascinating and entertaining talker\nwho covered everything from finding\na story to increasing your charm.\nFinally, there were the elections to\nthe committee of the SPA where our\nEditor-elect continued her election-winning habits and duly bagged\nherself the role of Events Officer.\nMy soothing stop at Grantham (still\nlovely) allowed time for reflection on\nwhat was a brilliant weekend. It\u2019s well\nworth getting involved with Felix to\nattend these sorts of things. At the\nvery worst, your Twitter following\nwill increase by about 350% (as mine\ndid) or even better, you\u2019ll meet some\ngenuinely interesting and intelligent\npeople doing some really exciting\nstuff. Keep an eye out for SPANC 2015\nas Felix has high hopes for hosting\nnext year!\nFelix goes to #SPANC for the weekend\nLaurence de Lussy Kubisa reminisces about the Student Publication Association National Conference\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nT\nhe Student Publication\nAssociation (SPA) is\nvery much in its infancy,\nespecially when compared\nto other media associations,\nsuch as the Student Radio Association.\nThis is particularly surprising\nconsidering nearly every university\nhas a newspaper, either independently\nran or overseen by their union, like\nFelix.\nWith this in mind, is there even\na need for the SPA, if it is apparent\nthat publications have been running\nsuccessfully without this overarching\nrepresentation? Not only that, but\nwhat can the SPA actually do?\nAfter talking to other editors of the\nvarious newspapers and magazines\nacross the country, it seems that the\ninteractions some publications have\nwith their respective institutions are\nin fact often strained, and sometimes\npushed to breaking point.\nThere seems to be a spectrum of\ncensorship across student media, and\nit seems that few publications are true\navenues for free student press. I spoke\nto editors that were effectively usurped\nby censoring sabbaticals, others that\nhad their publications hidden during\nopen days, and yet others that were\ncensored by media or communication\nsabbaticals hell-bent on protecting the\nreputation of institutions at the cost of\nfree speech.\nOne of my manifesto points was\nto reduce the union influence over\nthe publication, and after attending\nSPANC, it has come to light just how\nimportant this will be to uphold. The\nposition of Felix within this censorship\nspectrum has wavered over the years,\nand at the moment the relationship\nbetween the paper and the union is a\npleasant one, but we need to ensure\nthat this continues.\nJoining the SPA executive committee\nwas a decision I made because I believe\nthat student newspapers, regardless of\ntheir financial background, should not\nbe limited in what they print as long as\nit is factually accurate and within the\ninterest of the student body.\nOur motto is to \u201ckeep the cat free,\u201d\nand is something I will always uphold,\ndespite being forever grateful that\nthe union keeps us financially in the\nblack. However, there will always be\ntimes where simply repeating such\nan aphorism will not be enough,\nso hopefully one day, through the\nframework of the SPA, we will be\nable to turn to other publications for\nadvice, support and aid, and vice versa.\nThe successes of Felix can be used\nas inspiration for some publications,\nwhilst we can draw off the strengths\nof others.\nThrough this unification of student\npublications, the SPA will be able to\nreach out to unions and universities\nalike to promote the benefits and\nindeedtherightsofstudentmedia,and\nalso keep them in check should things\ngo awry. Not only that, the SPA has\nthe potential to introduce workshops\nto train student journalists, run future\nconferences to facilitate personal and\nprofessional networking between both\nstudent and full-time journalists and\ntheir publications, develop a media\nethics code, and enhance their awards\nsystem to introduce a standardised\nseal of approval for all the work\nstudent publications produce.\nThe SPA is not promising to deliver\nall of this all at once, but it definitely\nhas the capacity to do so, and is\nsomething I am willing to support as\nmuch as I possibly can. The student\nvoice is a powerful one, and hopefully\nby unifying all of the avenues that\npropagate this voice, it can reach its\nfull potential.\nStudent Media and Union Censorship\nEditor-Elect Philippa Skett ponders the relationship between student publications and free speech\n\n"

    "content": "20 FRIDAY 09 MAY\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nTranscendence\nDirector: Wally Pfister\nWriter: Jack Paglen\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Rebecca\nHall, Morgan Freeman, Paul Bettany,\nKate Mara, Cillian Murphy\nRuntime: 119 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nNo one likes a know-it-all. But for Evelyn Castor (Rebecca Hall), her significant other, her partner in science and\nin life, Will Castor (Johnny Depp) really does know it all. This is after a deadly assassination attempt with a bullet\nlaced in radiation slowly starts to shut\ndown his body. Evelyn has the brilliant\nidea of uploading every single aspect\nof Will\u2019s brain onto a smart computer,\nthereby creating the world\u2019s first artificial intelligence of this scale. Once\nthe transfer is complete, Will becomes\nthe most intelligent, crafty being on\nthe planet. As soon as this \u201cWill\u201d taps\ninto the internet, something that enables him to accessing every known bit\nof information around the world, he\nbecomes quite the useful company to\nhave around.\nThink of it as ARIA from the film\nEagle Eye acting as a loving guardian\nangel, watching over your safety, instead of trying to (spoilers for the film\nRise of the machine\nfor anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it) use you\nto kill every important member of the\nUnited States government. Because\nthe love Will had for Evelyn has also\nbeen directly lifted from his brain to\nthis AI, he does everything to look out\nfor her. It\u2019s touching, love knowing no\nbounds, not even physical death, but\nthis being a science-fiction drama,\nit turns into something more creepy,\nwhich makes us question just what\nit is about another human being that\nmakes us fall utterly in love.\nBut with a creation this powerful,\ncomes obvious dangers associated\nwith this. The question of this new\nWill\u2019s true identity of course comes\ninto question here, the fear of \u201chas\nhe turned too evil\u201d and \u201cwill he use\nhis potentially limitless powers for\ngood or bad\u201d are the burning issues\nthat need addressing before supposedly the world\u2019s safety is compro-mised. Or at least this is what the anti-technology domestic terrorist group\nRevolutionary Independence From\nTechnology (RIFT) is most concerned\nabout. Curiously enough, despite their\nstrong, violent objections (they are\nthe ones responsible for Will\u2019s radiation bullet wound), they themselves\nare not so opposed to benefiting from\nslick technology. Poor writing or intentional hypocrisy? You be the judge\nof that one. Led by Bree (Kate Mara),\nwho looks dark and mysterious, she\nreveals herself to be not just in this\nfor the dumb fun of blood and body\ncounts, but actually has a legitimate\nreason of her own to be taking part in\nsuch a dangerous operation.\nIf you can look past the obvious\nmajor flaw without which the rest of\nthe film cannot continue, the idea that\nsticking some electrodes into a person\u2019s brain can somehow extract absolutely everything about that person\nto an inanimate storage unit, a process\nthat takes quite a period of time that\nultimately does absolutely no damage\nwhatsoever to the uploader, Transcendence is an admirable, intelligent\nfilm pampered by wonderfully slick\ndesigns. First-time director Wally\nPfister comes to grips with the many\ngenre aspects of the film, quickly moving through the events with snappy\nsequences.\nTaking refuge quite literally in the\nmiddle of nowhere, Evelyn sets up a\nbrand new underground research laboratory to continue her work with her\nhusband. Incidentally, this is thanks\nto Will\u2019s large contribution to her financial well-being. Being a super AI\nallows him to play the stock market\nincredibly well, one of the many benefits of having this sort of guy around.\nEven the remote, rundown location\nwas found by him. There he develops\na remarkable set of scientific advance-ments, a lot of them that seem quite\nsimply out of this world. Does the film\nrequire a stretch of the imagination?\nYes. But once fully immersed into the\nnarrative, so much fun can be had toying with the endless possibilities Will\nthe hologram presents.\nBut at the heart of it all is the fascinating exploration of the romance\nbetween Evelyn and Will. It\u2019s certainly\none that is no doubt doomed for fail-ure. Will is technically there, but then\nit can be argued that he is not, he\nwatches and analyses her every move\nand emotion, although the same cannot be said for what she can do with\nhim. Caught in this struggle is the\nmagnificent Rebecca Hall, intelligent\nand devoted to her scientific cause,\nnot quite seeing what all the big fuss\nis about when her colleagues Joseph\nTagger (Morgan Freeman) and Max\nWaters (Paul Bettany) remain scepti-cal. The strain that is placed between\nthe couple becomes more evident as\nWill grows more powerful and \u201caware\u201d\nso to speak, and as can be expected of\nsomeone in this highly unusual pre-dicament, the unravelling of her once-perfect life is quite the dramatic one.\nIt\u2019s the fact that Will starts playing\nGod that seems to be causing the biggest friction. Illnesses are being cured,\nand there appears to be no limit as to\nwhat this new Will is capable of. The\nplot brings up moral dilemmas, ones\nthat cannot be fully shaped perhaps in\nthe medium of film. It\u2019s really up to the\naudience to have a think afterwards.\nAnd where the film really hooks its\nviewers is with its intriguing initial\nconcept, that is slowly expanded, with\na touch of Wally Pfister\u2019s neat visual\nflourishes.\nThe film\u2019s poor box-office show-ing, something that will cost Alcon\nEntertainment a lot of money, is a\ngreat shame. Its hefty budget of $100\nmillion looks to have been spent in\ncreating just the right futuristic at-mosphere, and with its strong performances rom a star-studded cast plus\nexciting premise, this sci-fi thriller\nshould have done better. The \u201caction\u201d\nfinale is underwhelming, but when it\nall quietens down, there is an air of\ntouching poignancy, something the\nfilm works hard towards achieving.\n\n"

    "content": "5\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 09 MAY\nFEATURES\nI\nt\u2019s often said that in the Internet\nAge there is no more anonymity\nbut this is only half true. Yes,\nthanks to Facebook I\u2019ll know that\nthe girl from my old English class\nin Year 12 has just broken up with\nher boyfriend and is playing Taylor\nSwift on a tear-filled triumphant\nloop on Spotify but the internet\nhas also opened up so many ways\nto be completely expressive and yet\ncompletely anonymous. Take Twitter.\nWhile my own handle is @roryfenton\n(Hint: follow me. I\u2019m lonely), many of\nthe people I follow use anonymous\naccounts. @LetterOfNote shares\ninteresting letters written by famous\nand not-so-famous hands. @IAM_\nSHAKESPEARE (\u201cWilly Shakes\u201d) fills\nmy timeline with accidental innuendos\nfrom Shakespeare\u2019s plays (today\u2019s\ninclude \u201cHis youthful hose, well sav\u2019d,\na world too wide\u201d from As You Like\nIt). These don\u2019t, however, represent\nthe bulk of anonymous tweeters.\nLess interesting or humorous are\nthe countless accounts set up to\nanonymously abuse other Twitter\nusers. When you see someone like\nLenny Henry told to \u201cEFF OFF BACK\nTO *insert misspelt African country*\u201d,\nthere\u2019s a good chance that was sent\nfrom an anonymous account, possibly\nset up just to send that tweet. To\nexaggerate a little, it seems we\u2019re stuck\nwith either arseholery on anonymous\nTwitter or Too Much Information on\nnonymous Facebook. Yes I made the\nword \u201cnonymous\u201d up.\nInto the fray steps new app Secret,\naiming to provide an anonymous\nplatform for users to share their\nbiggest secrets with friends. Launched\njust weeks ago, I decided to try it out. I\nfirst heard about the app when it shot\nto fame after a Nike employee posted\nthat the company was about to fire its\nFuel Band staff. I say \u201cNike employee\u201d,\nit could have been absolutely anyone\nbecause Secret is anonymous in\nextremis. Loading up the app for the\nfirst time you enter your email address\nbut create no username or handle.\nWhen you post a \u201csecret\u201d, it is not\nlinked to any particular user, not even\nto a pseudonym. You can publish \u201cI\nlike Steve\u201d and immediately after \u201cI\nhave mixed feelings about Steve\u201d with\nno way to tell it was the same person\nsaying both.\nUnlike Twitter, you can\u2019t choose\nwhom to follow. Your Secret friends\nwill be automatically added using your\niPhone contacts (an Android version\nis en route) so, short of actually asking\nthem, you\u2019ll never know which of your\nfriends are populating your timeline.\nIf you like a post (a \u201csecret\u201d), you\ncan swipe right on it to \u201clove\u201d it just\nlike a \u201clike\u201d on Facebook and you\ncan comment too. Commenters are\nidentified by little symbols beside\ntheir comments (such as a blue ship\nor a yellow flower) so you can have\nconversations on a secret and keep\ntrack of who says what but when you\ncomment on another secret, your\nsymbol will change, keeping your\nidentity hidden.\nWhen you love a secret, that secret\nwill appear on your friends\u2019 timelines,\nenabling secrets to go \u201cviral\u201d like a\ntweet being retweeted and until you\nreach ten friends using the app (I\ncurrently have an embarrassing 5) you\ncan\u2019t tell if a secret was posted by a\nfriend or simply loved by them.\nThe app itself is one of the nicest\napps I\u2019ve ever used. Secrets come with\nthe text itself (limited to about the\nlength of a tweet) and a background,\nwhich can be a photo or just a colour.\nThe result is a timeline that looks\nmuch neater than the clutter on\neither Facebook or Twitter, with text\nappearing in larger font. When I first\ngot Secret my Secret-using-friend\ncount stood at 1 so I had a timeline\nwith a total of 5 secrets in it, none\ntoo exciting, mostly slagging off\nengineers. I decided to dive in and\nshare my first secret: \u201cI spent at least\none hour of everyday for the past\ntwo weeks watching Graham Norton\nYouTube clips and now there are none\nleft\u201d. I gave it an orange background\nbecause that\u2019s Graham\u2019s colour. The\nfact that I\u2019m sharing this \u201csecret\u201d\nin Felix gives away that I\u2019m not all\nthat ashamed of it; it wasn\u2019t, really,\na proper secret. Nonetheless within\nan hour my 21st Century need for\nsanitised human contact was satisfied\nby a pity love from that one friend\nand a simultaneous pity comment\u201capproved\u201d. Thanks one friend. Happy\nwith my first attempt at secretting, I\ninvited a load of my phone contacts\n(they receive anonymous emails\nfrom Secret itself) and tucked myself\ninto bed to dream-up new scenes for\nGraham Norton.\nUpon waking, I opened up Secret\nto find my friend count had swollen\nto 3 friends. This three-fold increase\nactually had a huge impact on the\nnumber of secrets I could see, as not\nonly did my friends\u2019 secrets enter my\nfeed, so did those they had loved. I\ncould now get an idea of just what kind\nof thing people were posting. A typical\n\u201csecret\u201d is wildly removed from TV\nchat show addictions. Gentle reader\nbe warned: Secret contains a *lot*\nabout sex. Nothing especially explicit\nand seldom sweary, just people being\nreally honest about their likes and\ndislikes. Of course, this could really\njust be representative of the kind of\npeople I\u2019m friends with- your timeline\nwill be unique to your friendship\ngroup.\nI decided to follow suit and send\nout a slightly saucier second secret,\none I certainly won\u2019t put in Felix. This\none was a proper secret, enough to\nmake me Google \u201csecret app security\u201d\nbefore posting it with all the caution\nof a mother duck setting her little\nbaby duck on the pond for the first\ntime. It was at this point, kind reader,\nI became a bit of a Secret Super Star.\nExtending well beyond my three\nfriends, within an hour my secret\nhad been loved by 20 different people\nand attracted approving and shocked\ncomments respectively from a red cat\nand green bottle. I set my phone aside\nto do some revision (and, let\u2019s face it,\nscrape the barrel of Graham Norton\nclips) to find my 20 loves now stood\nat 50 as I tucked myself again into bed,\nfeeling smug. Bedtime for Rory is just\nearly evening in the States, where the\napp is most popular. While I dreamily\nplanned the interactions in a fantasy\ninterview between Graham and Elvis,\nmy secret sped down the zipline of\nfriend-to-friend connections across\nthe Atlantic and as I groggily opened\nthe app that next morning, it had been\nloved by over 250 people. That\u2019s 250\npeople who were sufficiently moved\nby my tale of smut that they moved\na finger the full width of a phone\nscreen in loving admiration. Red\nCat and Green Bottle had now been\njoined by ten other friends, including\na disapproving blue bicycle helmet.\nHelmets, eh?\nBeing, as I am, a Massive Big Deal,\nthis wasn\u2019t my first experience of\nGoing Viral as last month I managed\n500 retweets on what turned out to be\nthe first photo of the UK\u2019s first married\nsame sex couple outside Islington\nTown Hall (seriously, @roryfenton,\ndo it). Being Secret-viral, however, is\na very different thing. I couldn\u2019t help\nbut be pleased that so many people\nwere loving something I\u2019d done and\nyet it was something I was far too\nembarrassed to actually tell anyone\nabout. I took a screen shot of the wild\nnumber of notifications I\u2019d racked up\nand tweeted it boastfully but without\nthecontentoftheactualsecret,nobody\ncared. In boasting about my Secret\nsuccess, I was getting Secret all wrong;\nthe whole point is the anonymity.\nIn providing pure anonymity while\namong friends, the app works like the\nperfect masquerade ball where the fun\nisn\u2019t in working out who everyone is or\nwho has the most exciting disguise but\nin being completely and utterly open,\nthrowing caution to the wind and just\nstanding there in your brilliant, ugly,\nfaceless, truthful nudity. In boasting\nabout attracting so much \u201clove\u201d I was\ndesperately grasping at identity, at a\nway of standing out. To fully do Secret\nis to fully let go of the self. It\u2019s fucking\ndeep.\nAs I got more and more immersed\nI started to notice two different\ncategories of non-sex secrets. First,\nthere are the secrets that aren\u2019t really\n\u201csecrets\u201d at all but jokes of the \u201cI\u2019m\nsecretly Batman\u201d type. Funny, yes,\nbut nothing that couldn\u2019t be posted\nto Twitter. The second non-sexy\ncategory is something I really wasn\u2019t\nexpecting: there are some incredibly\nhonest, highly private posts that you\nsimply would never see on Twitter or\nFacebook. \u201cI\u2019m going to hurt someone\non Thursday and I can\u2019t help it but I\nfeel so terrible\u201d, for example, posted\nby someone about to break up with\ntheir boyfriend/ girlfriend elicited\ndozens of comments with advice\nand personal experience from other\npeople who been through the same\nthing. \u201cI\u2019m worried my taste in porn\nconflicts with my gender politics\u201d\nstarted a very frank, erudite debate on\nfeminism and pornography between\nfriends that could only have happened\nanonymously.\nI am just over a week on Secret and\nI\u2019m utterly hooked. When someone\nposts something highly personal\nto Facebook, it can feel fake, as if\nthey are seeking attention or passive\naggressively getting at someone else.\nOn Secret these possibilities are\nstripped away as people fully, honestly\nexpose a part of themselves in search\nof advice or maybe just the knowledge\nthat someone knows their truth, albeit\nnot whose truth it is. On Twitter I\ncan follow anyone in the world and\nin turn be followed by anyone. With\nSecret, I know that I am hearing from\nfriends and their friends which adds\na weight and proximity to what they\nsay. When I post a secret I could be\nreceiving sincere advice from my best\nfriend or a stranger on the other side\nof the world connected to me by a\ncomplex web of mutual acquaintance-I can judge advice on content alone.\n\u201cI have chronic depression that once\nbecame so severe that I took several\nweeks of absence from work while I\nsought treatment. I told my boss and\ncoworkers that I had mono. I didn\u2019t\nwant to deal with the stigma\u201d. When\nwas the last time someone opened up\nto you like that? Someone did to me,\n5 minutes ago, on Secret. A friend of\na friend. The secret has no comments\n(what could you possibly say?) but\nloves. Hundreds of them. Letting\nthat person know that even if they\ndon\u2019t want to be named, people care.\nAnd as that person uses Secret they\nwill see from others that they are not\nalone. Anonymity among friends is a\npowerful thing.\nWith fewer Batman jokes and more\nopenness, Secret has enormous\npotential. It is wonderfully therapeutic\nto be so open and with fewer friends\nthan fingers, each secret can be\nproperly appreciated. The fact that\nonly one secret fits on the screen at\na time adds to this. If I were the app\u2019s\ndeveloper, I would keep \u201clove\u201d but\nstop telling people how much love\nthey\u2019ve received. That would stop the\noccasional jokey attention seeking and\nbring the level up to just letting stuff\ngo. I look forward to seeing where\nSecret goes over the next months and\nyears. It has found something very\nspecial that no other social network\nhas quite managed. Give it a go.\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering, my viral\nSecret currently has over 450 loves\n#BigDeal\n#HashtagsOnlyWorkOnTwitter\n#ThisIsANewspaper\n#GodINeedToGetOutMore\nRory Fenton\n@roryfenton\nRory Fenton reveals (almost) all with a look at the hot new \u201cSecret\u201d app.\nTell me friends, what is your Secret?\n\n"

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 09 MAY\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBack in February, Felix ran an article\non the history of the female nude in art.\nBut what of the male? The female nude\nis omnipresent and openly celebrated\nin Western art; she adorns the walls of\ntoday\u2019s galleries, magisterially inviting\nour appreciation. By contrast, her\nmale counterpart is overwhelmingly\nunderrepresented. Pendulous phalluses\nare few and far between.\nHistorically, this was not always the\ncase. Until the 19th century, nudes\nin Western art were predominantly\nmale. Over the centuries our society\nhas developed a double standard in\nour attitude towards nudity \u2013 whilst\nfemale nudity has become increasingly\naccepted, that of the male has become\nsomewhat taboo. However, current\ncensorship of men\u2019s bodies is a sad\nreflection of the male nude\u2019s illustrious\nhistory in art.\nThe male nude was central to early\nclassical art; as a paragon of beauty and\nembodiment of philosophical ideals.\nNudes such as Myron\u2019s Discobolus 450-460BC (a marble copy of which can be\nseen at the British Museum) represent a\nGreekaestheticideal.Poisedmid-throw,\ntheathletehasthekindofphysiquemany\ngym-goers today dream of attaining, his\nmuscular thighs and gleaming buttocks\nsymbols of his masculinity. To some\nextent, such sculptures are imitations,\na reflection of everyday life in Ancient\nGreece, where athletes traditionally\ncompeted naked. However, to depict a\nsubject nude was also to venerate him -sculptures of mythological heroes and\nGods stand naked alongside athletes.\nAs a society open to male sexuality\nand homoeroticism, the Greeks saw\nno shame in male nudity. By contrast,\nuntil Praxiteles\u2019 nude Aphrodite, female\ndeities in art were typically robed.\nThe introduction of Christianity\nin Europe saw a decline in both male\nand female nudes in art of the Middle\nAges, and perhaps set a precedent\nfor censorship of the male body.\nNude studies were only deemed\nacceptable where necessary in religious\nrepresentations, marking an end to the\nGreek and Roman exaltation of the male\nform.\nThe Renaissance heralded his\nreturn, as an idealised form to study\n\u201cmankind\u201d in anatomical drawings, and\nwith the resurgence of neoclassicism.\nHowever, with prevailing religious\nideals, depiction of the classical nude\nhad become problematic. Renaissance\nEurope\u2019s reverence for Greek ideology\nand philosophy did not extend\nto acceptance of male nudity and\nhomoeroticism. Nudes are not asexual\n\u2013 the art historian Kenneth Clark said\n\u201cno nude\u2026should fail to arouse in\nthe spectator some vestige of erotic\nfeeling\u2026 if it does not do so it is bad art\u201d\n.\nBut the majority of Renaissance artists\nwere male, and homosexual acts were\npunishable by death.\nParadoxically, the threat of\nreligious censorship appeared to\nliberate Renaissance artists in their\nrepresentation of the male nude. Many\nreligious paintings of the period are\nat once erotically charged and violent\nin their punishment of the male nude\nfor the sinful feelings he evoked in the\nviewer;theripplingtorsoofBoticelliand\nMantenega\u2019s St. Sebastian is studded\nwith arrows. Such works associated\nthe male nude with a new vulnerability\nabsent from the heroic nudes of classical\nart.\nElsewhere, sensuality began to creep\ninto male nude artworks, providing\nan outlet for homoerotic feelings\nprohibited by society. Donatello\u2019s David\nsculpture, one of the first examples of\na classical male subject studied from\nlife, is overtly seductive. Hand on hips,\nhis come-hither stance and curvaceous\ncontours also break from traditional\ndepictions of the male nude. Threatened\nby the emerging eroticism in male\nnude artworks, the church continued\nto censor them.

    "content": "25\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 09 MAY\nFILM\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nAn inconvenient truth\nIt\u2019s a great shame that Yari Film Group\nReleasing had to declare bankruptcy\njust before the release of Nothing but\nthe Truth. This meant that the sharp-ly-written, well-acted, legal/political\nthriller would never get a proper wide\nrelease date in the States or anywhere\nelse in the world. A film that was trying to angle an Oscar nomination for\nits leading lady Kate Beckinsale, that\nopportunity was of course thrown out\nthe window along with any hopes of\nsignificant financial profit. A quiet\nDVD release was the ultimate, undeserving fate the film had to embrace\nand a region 2 version release in the\nU.K. is finally here.\nRachel Armstrong (Beckinsale) is\na reporter for the Capital Sun-Times\nworking on the biggest story of her ca-reer, a story big and powerful enough\nto take down the President. She has\nwritten an article outing a covert\nC.I.A operative Erica Van Doren (Vera\nFarmiga) and her detailed mission report that was completely disregarded\nby the White House when ordering\na military strike against Venezuela.\nThe government, desperate to cover\nup their tracks, acts immediately, apprehending Armstrong, forcing her\nto give up her source. With her principles and journalist\u2019s integrity on the\nline, she refuses to cooperate. Treated\nas a treasonous offense, she is held\nin contempt of court, ends up in jail\nand sparks a controversy that starts\naffecting her family and obviously,\nher career. But when it\u2019s National Security on the line, all bets are off and\nshe knows the government will never\nback down easily. It\u2019s a battle between\nthe First Amendment and National\nSecurity.\nInspired by the case of Judith Miller, an ex-journalist for the New York\nTimes whose coverage of Iraq\u2019s alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction\nprogram both before and after the\ninvasion landed her in jail for a few\nmonths, \u201cNothing but the Truth\u201d\nimmediately benefits from having a\nNothing but the\nTruth\nDirector: Rod Lurie\nWriter: Rod Lurie\nStarring: Kate Beckinsale, Matt\nDillon, Angela Bassett, Alan Alda,\nVera Farmiga, David Schwimmer\nRuntime: 108 minutes\nCertification: 15\ncurrently relevant, intriguing source\nmaterial. The topic itself can spark\noff a debate that can easily last for\ndays. What\u2019s more important? The\nreporter\u2019s loyal duty of privileged\nand confidential information to his/\nher source or the country\u2019s needs?\nWould you sacrifice your honour for a\ngovernment that constantly lies to its\ncitizens that ultimately lands them in\nmore trouble than ever before? This\nheated political debate is forever ongoing and the film leaves the audience\nto think for themselves. Some may\nend up being frustrated at Armstrong,\nfor being so stubborn and unpatriotic,\nwhereas others might praise her and\ncheer on her bravery to stand on her\nown two feet to fight off the manipulative forces of the government.\nDirector Rod Lurie, despite tackling\na big controversial political argument,\nmakes this film as much about the\npeople involved, not the complicated\nsubject matter. He keeps the events\nsmall-scale and intimate, more about\nhow these characters interact with\neach other, and how this case starts\nto influence Rachel and those around\nher. The various characters all have\nindividuality, no crucial character is\nside-lined and with no nonsense style\nof writing, the sharp, comprehensible,\nsnappy dialogue builds plenty of suspense without having to extend the\nplot into an unmanageable size.\nBeckinsale is spot-on as the protag-onist, caught in a major moral dilem-ma, the well-known pressure of being\na working mother piling up faster than\never all because of this sticky situation.\nOn the one hand, she\u2019s the honour-able, selfless journalist trying to do the\nright thing, protecting the newspaper,\nher source but on the other hand, she\nhas the endless temptation to come\nclean, to be near her beloved husband\nand son: Beckinsale has absolutely no\ntrouble showing us both the strength\nand weakness of the character and\nit\u2019s possible she would have garnered\nsome nominations had this film been\nImperial College Cinema\nThe Lego Movie\nDirectors: Phil Lord, Christopher\nMiller\nWriters: Phil Lord, Christopher\nMiller\nStarring: (voices) Chris Pratt,\nElizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson,\nMorgan Freeman, Will Arnett, Will\nFerrell\nRuntime: 100 minutes\nCertification: U\nT\nhe announcement that\na movie based around\neveryone\u2019s favourite line\nof construction toys was\nmet with rants about the\nextent of consumerism in cinema.\nHowever, cynics will be pleasantly\nsurprised by the actual film that has\nemerged which has garnered near\nuniversal acclaim for its beautiful\nanimation, charming humour and\nhilarious send up of the \u2018traditional\u2019\nHollywood blockbuster.\nEveryman (toy) Emmet is a fairly\ntalentless construction worker in\nBricksburg who after accidentally\nfalling into a hole, discovers an\nunusual piece of red lego-the \u2018piece\nof resistance\u2019 purported to be able to\nstop the evil Lord Business. Emmet\nis soon declared to be \u2018the special\u2019\nbased on an old prophecy. Even when\nlater on this prophecy turns out to\njust be a load of hot air, Emmet is\nstill tasked with saving toykind from\nBusiness\u2019 evil clutches.\nThe Lego Movie\nTuesday 13/05/14 19:00\nFriday 16/05/14 19:00\n\u00a33 Members/\u00a34 Non-Member\nreleased properly.\nThere are many familiar faces that\nfill the screen. Matt Dillon, a teen idol\nin the 80s is the main prosecutor in\ncharge of getting Armstrong to con-fess, Academy Award nominee Angela Bassett plays Armstrong\u2019s boss\nat the Capital Sun-Times, supporting\nher employee as well as trying to protect the newspaper\u2019s reputation, E.R.\u2019s\nNoah Wyle is the legal counsel to the\nnewspaper, Friends\u2019 David Schwimmer, taking on his first dramatic role\nsince 2001 is Armstrong\u2019s husband\nand the legendary Alan Alda is the\nlawyer defending our journalist. The\nensemble works to an extraordinary\nlevel with not one performance out\nof place or at fault. Dillon can be one\nsmug, hateful litigator but we\u2019re reminded that he\u2019s doing his job in seeking justice, a man truly concerned over\nthe welfare of the country\u2019s National\nSecurity. Farmiga, always a reliable\nactress in both leading and supporting\nroles, shows both fear and frustration\ntowards this whole situation that\u2019s also\nmaking the government question her\nloyalty to the agency. Schwimmer\u2019s\ncharacter starts as the reliable, supportive husband but as the case drags\non and on, we see him lose his faith,\nbeing disappointed in Rachel that she\nwould choose her job over her family,\nand these emotions are portrayed so\nwell by someone we only mainly knew\nas a comedy actor.\nThe final revelation, a shocking\ntwist which turns out to be a more\nthan plausible and satisfying explanation to Rachel\u2019s never-ending quest\nto protect her source, is definitely an\nunexpected and intelligent one that\nputs a nice ending to one of the most\nthought-provoking and socially relevant films that disappointingly went\nunnoticed. There are many straight-to-DVD gems out there, ones that unfortunately did not have the right circumstances to get a wide release. This\nis one of those films, an unmissable,\nthrilling treat.\n\n"

    "content": "14 FRIDAY 09 MAY\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nIt\u2019s like it\u2019s 2009 all over again\nStuart Masson reviews the recent albums by three of his old favourites\nI\ntmayhavebeenjustfiveyearsago,\nbut 2009 seems like the distant\npast. I was still in sixth form,\nand, more importantly for the\ncontext of this review, I had fully\nimmersed myself in the wide world of\nmusic. The landfill indie of my teenage\nyears had been put to one side, and I\nwas making the most of my discovery\nthat alternative music meant a hell\nof a lot more than The Libertines.\nIt was a great time to be getting\ninto alternative music as well with\nAnimal Collective\u2019s Merriweather\nPost Pavilion, The Flaming Lips\u2019\nbrilliant double album Embryonic\nand Grizzly Bear\u2018s Veckatemist all\nreleased in 2009. There were also\nsuperb debuts from Japandroids,\ntUnE-yArDs and, admittedly in 2008,\nTitus Andronicus.\nThere were three albums that were\neverpresentonmyiPodclassicthough:\nHospice by The Antlers, The Pains of\nBeing Pure at Heart\u2019s eponymous\ndebut album and Primary Colours\nby The Horrors. Hospice is a dream\npop / slowcore concept album about\na hospice worker falling in love with a\npatient. It is absolutely heartbreaking,\nand one of my all time favourite\nrecords to this day. The Pains record\nwas very heavily indebted to shoegaze\nbehemoth My Bloody Valentine but\nwith a pop sensibility nowhere to be\nseen on Loveless. The Horrors were\nperhaps the oddity, in that their debut\nStrange House, a horror punk meets\nThe Strokes type affair, had been one\nof my favourites during the landfill\nindie stage. Primary Colours was\nsomething else entirely though. Gone\nwas any trace of garage rock, and in\nits place was a psychedelic shoegaze\nrecord ending with the utterly genius\nSea Within a Sea.\nAll three bands released albums in\n2011, with The Antlers\u2019 Burst Apart\nbeing the pick of the bunch. Instead of\ntrying to match the emotional depth of\nHospice, they went down the textured\ndream pop route, with reasonable\nsuccess. The Pains\u2019 Belong was very\nmuch a slightly worse version of their\ndebut whilst The Horrors\u2019 Skying felt\nlike a no risk Primary Colours by\nnumbers and I really didn\u2019t see the\npoint. Coincidentally, all three have\nnew albums out this year as well. The\nAntlers\u2019 Familiars is due out in June,\nwhilst The Horrors\u2019 Luminous came\nout this week and the Pains new album\nDays of Abandon was released back in\nApril. It\u2019s been five years, so what has\nbecome of these old favourites?\nAll three records start with a pretty\ndull track. The Antlers open with a\nlong boring dream pop track that\nsounds somewhere between Hospice\nand Burst Apart with none of the\ncharm of either. The Horrors also\ngo for some benign dream pop, with\nnone of the creativity of Primary\nColours and lots of the banality that\nmade Skying so forgettable. The Pains\ntrack is just bland as shit. There is very\nlittle feedback though, which implies\nthat, against all odds, The Pains of\nBeing Pure at Heart have changed\ndirection. In reality, all three of them\nhave to different extents. All three of\nthem are definitely better than the first\ntrack would imply though.\nThe Antlers record manges to get\nthrough another couple of really dull\nelongated dream pop numbers before\nthe good stuff, with Doppelganger and\nHotel both being very forgettable.\nIntruders is much better though.\nIt\u2019s still a long dream pop song, but\nwith it\u2019s occasional staccato guitar\njabs and lilting vocal melody it\u2019s a\nmuch better crafted track. The piano\nladen Revisited and the chamber pop\ninspired Parade are also really pretty\ntracks. The final track, Refuge, has an\nalmost sexy guitar part, and I never\nthought I\u2019d write that in an Antlers\nreview, but then it also kind of works.\nInstrumentally, this is probably as\ngood as the Antlers have ever released.\nThe arrangements have the same lush\ntextures as Burst Apart, but with\na variety and coherence that was\nmissing on that record. There\u2019s still\nsomething not quite right though.\nPeter Silberman has one of the\nbest voices in indie. Whether it\u2019s\nhis hauntingly delicate falsetto\nor his anguished wailing, it was\nSilberman\u2019s voice that made Hospice\nso spectacular, but it\u2019s also the weak\npoint here. His voice was the perfect\nvehicle for the subject matter of\nHospice. Vulnerability and anguish\nare exactly what you want for songs\nabout the love of your life dying of\ncancer, the kids you never had with\nher and the dreams you still have\nabout her now she\u2019s gone. Compared\nto that, tracks about growing up and\nfeeling a bit disjointed about it just\nsounds a bit disingenuous. They may\nhave withdrawn the heavy subject\nmatter with Burst Apart, but they\nalso reined in Silberman\u2019s anguish,\nand that worked. They tried to create\nsomething sepearate, that could\nbe judged on its own merits, and it\nworked. This seems like a regression\nback towards the hallowed turf of\nHospice, and it ends up taking the\nworst parts of the two albums. It\u2019s\nnot bad, and if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019d\nbe really excited if a new band came\nout with this. The Antlers set the bar\ntoo high with Hospice, and I\u2019m slightly\nannoyed that they are even trying to\njump over it again.\nThe Pains have a lot less pressure on\nthem. Belong was a fairly forgettable\nrehash of the debut, and I was fully\nexpecting another lazy effort from\nthem with this one. As such, they\ncome out of it looking a lot better\nthan the Antlers. Days of Abandon\nis a far from perfect album, in fact\nit\u2019s probably a lot more flawed than\nFamiliars, but it feels a lot fresher.\nAfter the uninspiring opener comes\nSimple and Sure, a song that sounds\nmore like The New Pornographers\nthan it does My Bloody Valentine.\nIt\u2019s straight up North American indie\npop and it\u2019s not half bad. The next\ntrack, Kelly, isn\u2019t even a little bit bad.\nA bouncy little indie pop number with\na super catchy riff and a shimmering\njangly background, it really does\nsparkle. It\u2019s distinctly something\nthey would write, but the production\nelevates it to something different. This\nis the legacy of acts like The Smiths\nand Felt, and it\u2019s really quite superb.\nUp next is another curveball.\nTPOBPAH have always done shoegaze\nwith a pop sensibility, and after three\ntracks of pop sensibility with minimal\nshoegaze I really hadn\u2019t prepared\nmyself for shoegaze with minimal\npop sensibility. This is perhaps where\nthe album lets itself down. There is\nvirtually no coherence. Along with\nblatant MBV worship in Beautiful\nYou and Until the Sun Explodes, the\nrest of the album contains a few more\nNew Pornographers inspired tracks\nin Eurydice and Life After Life and a\ndreamy closer that has no place on\nthis album.\nThe good tracks here are really\ngood, and there\u2019s quite a few great\nones. Eurydice, Kelly and Until the Sun\nExplodes are all some of the best work\nthe band has done, and the only weak\npoints are the opener, closer and Coral\nand Gold. This isn\u2019t a stone cold classic\nlike the debut, but then it was never\ngoing to be, and at least it\u2019s better than\nBelong. This shows that the Pains\nweren\u2019t a one album wonder, and\nthat there\u2019s still something potentially\nreally good in the tank, even if this\nisn\u2019t quite it.\nThe Horrors were the band for\nwhom I had the least expectations.\nOf the three albums mentioned at\nthe beginning, Primary Colours is the\none I play least frequently nowadays,\nand after the extremely dry Skying I\nhad pretty much given up on them. I\ndecided to give Luminous a listen, and\nI\u2019m glad I did. They aren\u2019t playing it\nsafe this time around. This is at least as\nvaried as Primary Colours, and whilst\nit\u2019s a bit more hit and miss, it\u2019s still one\nof the more exciting albums I\u2019ve heard\nthis year.\nSo Now You Know is a pulsating,\nswirling track with a catchy hook and\nso much else going on besides. It\u2019s\nthe best thing they\u2019ve done since Sea\nWithin a Sea, but there\u2019s plenty more\nto interest the listener. Jealous Sun\nadmittedly basically is a My Bloody\nValentine, but it\u2019s good enough to\nforgive, whilst Falling Star channels\nsome of the sound that Tame Impala\nhave perfected, but with a twinkly\nsynth creating an almost playful\natmosphere.\nThere are few less successful tracks.\nIn and Out of Sight has a dancey sort\nof thing going on that doesn\u2019t really\nwork in the context of the song, let\nalone the album and the dream pop\nleviathan bookends aren\u2019t ideal. That\nbeing said, unless the Horrors are\nfailing in trying something new this\ntime around. The mistake on Skying\nwas in a lack of ambition, but there\u2019s\nplenty of that here, even if it leads to\na few mistakes.

The Pains\nhave already disappointed me and I\nexpected them to continue to do so,\nand they receive a partonising pat\non the head for at least trying a bit\nharder this time around.

    "content": "\u201cKeep the\nCat Free\u201d\nSPORT\nEditor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWith the sun and the schedule finally\ncoalescing in a fashion allowing for\na match, the Imperial 2\u2019s kickstarted\nour 2014 season in the best possible\nfashion, delivering a win for new\nskipper Sam Mead. Having lost the\ntoss on a \u201cdry\u201d wicket, we were put\nin to field and pressure was on the\nfrontline seamers to make best use of\nthe new ball. The skipper himself led\nfrom the front, prising out 2 top order\nwickets with some good accurate\nbowling. He was ably supported\nby Nick Dunn from the other end,\nwho was making the best use of the\n\u201cmysterious\u201d Harlington bounce and\nwas unfortunate not to take wickets\nin his first spell. He was, however, able\nto completely tie up one end, finishing\nwith a scarcely believable economy\nrate of 1.50. Johan Rekers was in as\nfirst change and chipped in with a\nwicket as well, along with a rather\ncomical bouncer attempt which he\ninsists was off a \u201cgood length\u201d.\nThe middle overs belonged to the\nspin-twins, Mak Gill and Arvind\nRajagopalan, uniting the arts of\nfinger and wrist spin to good effect\nto counter a Birbeck middle-order\nriddled with front-foot defence\nexperts. 4 wickets were taken during\nthis period, including a poor man\u2019s\n\u201cBall of the Century\u201d from Arvind\nand a run-out by Mak. Both were\nunlucky not to get more with plenty\nof dropped catches and tough LBW\nappeals turned down. With a stubborn\ntail left to get through, Nick Dunn\nreturned and finally got the important\nbreakthrough to send Birbeck\u2019s\ncaptain (also named Arvind) back\nfor 58. Debutant Sarus Jain provided\na clinic in death bowling, repeatedly\ngetting the ball full outside offstump\nand going at only 4/over in his 5 overs,\nfinishing with a wicket. After a spirited\nbowling performance, Birbeck were\nheld to 139-8, giving Imperial a target\nof 140 to chase in 40 overs.\nImperial got off to a rollicking\nstart with Karan Dhall and Hemant\nMorjaria milking the Birbeck opening\npair for easy singles and twos.\nHighlights included a TransferWise\nMaximum by Karan, sending the ball\nflying over midwicket boundary, and\nHemant experiencing the first cramp\nof his life. Unfortunately both lost\ntheir wickets cheaply after getting\nstarts. Padman Bhatt, in at 3, was not\nable to stay for very long either, while\nLuke Gardner at 4 was able to club\na few past the fielders before losing\nhis wicket as well. Nick stabilised the\ninnings with skipper Sam, who despite\nbeing agonisingly out of touch, was\nable to fight to 19.\nAt this point, Birbeck\u2019s skipper\nArvind, who had been keeping for\nthem, decided to come on to bowl.\nProving to be an Allrounder in the\ntruest sense, he troubled Sam and Nick\non multiple occasions, leading to some\ndownright comical running between\nthe wickets due to the sheer pressure\nof the situation. Finally, he was able\nto prise out both their wickets. Our\nkeeper Matt Wetton tried his level\nbest but could not get the ball past\nthe infield. He did, however, register\nthe TransferWise shot of the day,\nplaying a two-handed forehand tennis\nsmash to a beamer. Mak Gill came\nand left without troubling the scorers,\nand Imperial was left in a precarious\nsituation, with 3/4 of the batting lineup back in the pavilion with half the\ngame left to play and around 30 runs\nleft to get.\nDisplaying unbelievable composure\nin his debut game, Sarus, in at 9,\nsteered the chase, finishing unbeaten\non 19. He was supported by no. 10\nJohan, who managed to scratch 6\noff the target before playing onto his\nstumps. In walked nightwatchman\nArvind, calmly driving a four down the\nground to tie the scores before a wide\ndelivery gave Imperial a hard-fought\nvictory by 1 wicket (140-9). In one\nof life\u2019s cruel ironies, one Arvind did\neverything in his power to try and win\nthe game for his team, but the winning\nruns came from the other Arvind,\nproving that teams, not individuals,\nwin matches.

Stop expecting a last minute substitution from\nthe Editor, \u00e0 la Giggs...\nLast weekend, Imperial\u2019s Ultimate\nFrisbee team \u2013 known more\ncommonly as the discDoctors \u2013\ndonned their trademark yellow\nshirts to compete in the first division\nof Outdoor University Nationals,\nhaving secured their place against\nlocal rivals during the south-east\nregional qualifiers in March. Discs\nflew, mud spattered, bones crunched,\nand the discDoctors recovered from\na sluggish start to seal their position\namong the top 10 university clubs in\nthe country.\nThings didn\u2019t start well. Having lost\nco-captain Stephan Rossbauer (an\nexperienced club and national player)\nto a shoulder injury before the start\nof the tournament, the team\u2019s other\nco-captain James Threadgill followed\nsuit barely minutes into the first game\nof the tournament, dislocating his\nshoulder while diving for a defensive\nblock. Now down to 9 players with a\nlong weekend of Ultimate ahead, the\nteam began to fear that the reaper of\ninjuries was moving cruelly through\ntheir ranks, Final Destination-style.\nSaturday\u2019s group stages saw\nImperial lose out to Heriot-Watt,\nWarwick and York in hard-fought\ngames. Although they had played\nsome high-quality Ultimate, the\ndiscDoctors lacked cutting edge at\nkey moments, and were left holding\n16th seed (out of 16) at the halfway\nstage of the weekend. This left the\nplayers with plenty to contemplate as\nthey refuelled in Manchester\u2019s Curry\nMile on Saturday evening.\nOne benefit of having two captains\non the sideline, however, was the\ntacticaladvantagesitofferedtheteam.\nLining up against an experienced Bath\nside on Sunday morning, Imperial\nmade the bold decision to shift David\nPryce \u2013 one of the side\u2019s strongest\nthrowers, typically employed in the\n\u2018handler\u2019 role at the base of the attack\n\u2013 further upfield. With Phil Sandwell\nstepping comfortably into the central\nhandler role, the attack started\nflowing as Pryce combined slickly\nwith Ash Hemingway, club president\nJames Ward (spurred on by a growing\nfan club on the sideline) and Sam\nBrown \u2013 whose explosive pace had\ncaused teams trouble all weekend.\nImperial had found their mojo, and\nearned their first win of the weekend.\nThe team carried this momentum\ninto the next game, a rematch with\nHeriot-Watt. Again, Brown\u2019s pace\nwas instrumental to the attack, and\nthe team sealed an impressive 12\u20137\nwin as Ward swooped in for a sliding\ngrab in the end zone.\nNow in the plate final, the scent of\nsilverware was in the air. But as the\nafternoon drew on, Imperial\u2019s lack of\nnumbers began to take its toll, and the\nyellows lost out to a speedy Durham\nside in their final game. Nevertheless,\ntheir earlier efforts were enough\nfor Imperial to equal their best ever\nperformance at Outdoor Nationals,\nfinishing the tournament in a more-than-respectable 10th \u2013 a fitting\nsend-off for several of the team\u2019s\ndeparting veterans.\nThe weekend also saw Imperial\u2019s\nfemale contingent in action, as they\ncombined with players from UCL\nand King\u2019s to enter as a London\n\u00fcber-team. Strong performances\nthroughout the weekend, including\na gutsy win against a highly-rated\nLeeds side, saw them rise from 20th\nseed to finish 6th. Not too shabby for\na first appearance at Nationals.\ndiscDoctors reach top 10\nEd Parker reports from Manchester\nPremier League\nFinal Day Predictions\nCardiff vs. Chelsea\nVincent Tan\u2019s bizarre decision to\nsack Malky Mackay left the Bluebirds\nodds-on relegation favourites for most\nof the season and they went out with a\nwhimper at St James\u2019 Park. They rarely\ndeliver even when the pressure is off\nso I doubt they will raise their game\nfor this dead rubber. 0-3\nFulham vs. Crystal Palace\nThe managerial merry-go-round\nat Craven Cottage has played no\nsmall part in Fulham\u2019s downfall\neither, although marginally improved\nperformances under Felix Magath,\nespecially at home, suggest they could\ngive their fans something to cheer\nabout with Palace\u2019s travails catching\nup on them. 1-0\nHull vs. Everton\nBoth Steve Bruce and Roberto\nMartinez have enjoyed memorable\nseasons and neither will want to end\non a low. It was finally confirmed last\nweekend neither side has nothing to\nplay for so the shackles will be off and\nwith the Toffees\u2019 flair players on song,\nthat could mean a Desmond. 2-2\nLiverpool vs. Newcastle\nThe Magpies\u2019 3-0 victory over lowly\nCardiff last weekend scarcely papered\nover the cracks at St James\u2019 Park. The\nfans want Alan Pardew out after a\nhorrendous run of form that means\nthey should be easy pickings for a\nReds side desperate to put pressure on\nMan City. 4-0\nMan City vs. West Ham\nThe Skyblues could be without both\nSergio Aguero and Yaya Toure but the\nexperience of winning the Premier\nLeague title in stoppage time 2 years\nago will stand them in good stead to\nget a result to secure the title. The fans\nhave turned on Big Sam, who may\nalready have agreed to leave Upton\nPark this summer. 4-0\nNorwich vs. Arsenal\nRealistically the Canaries\u2019 hopes\nof survival were utterly extinguished\nwhen Sunderland beat West Brom.\nTheir big problem is they cannot score\nfor toffee. By contrast, the Gunners\nwill be in buoyant mood after securing\nyet another season of Champions\nLeague football. 0-2\nSouthampton vs. Man United\nRyan Giggs looks unlikely to be\nhanded the reins on a permanent basis\nat Old Trafford after the disappointing\ndefeat last weekend, while the Saints\nwill want to end their brilliant season\non a high. They have all the confidence\nand can inflict a record 13th defeat on\nUnited at St Mary\u2019s. 2-0\nSunderland vs. Swansea\nThe Swans squad was suffering\nfrom a bit of end-of-season syndrome\nlast weekend having already secured\nPremier League football and I expect\na decision on Garry Monk\u2019s future has\nalready been made. Gus Poyet\u2019s side\nhave hit form at just the right time and\nwill lap up the love of the fans. 2-0\nTottenham vs. Aston Villa\nTim Sherwood knows he won\u2019t be\nat White Hart Lane come August but\nwill want to show the defeat to West\nHam last week was just a blip. Paul\nLambert\u2019s side are finally safe and will\nlook to hurt Spurs on the counter, but\nwith little to play for may struggle to\npenetrate their backline. 2-1\nWest Brom vs. Stoke City\nMark Hughes has enjoyed a\nsensational maiden season at the\nBritannia and needs just a point to\nbeat Tony Pulis\u2019 record points tally.\nThey are exceptionally well organised\nand the Baggies will duly oblige,\nhaving flattered to deceive for much\nof the season. 1-2\nJames White calls Sunday\u2019s games as the title race comes to its conclusion.\n\n"

However,\nthe salons became inundated with\nfemale nudes, reflecting an emerging\npreference for the \u201csofter\u201d feminine\naesthetic ideal. Male nudes came to\nbe associated with obsolete and stuffy\nacademic teaching. The art historian\nSolomon-Godeau suggests that post-Renaissance, masculine identity was in\ncrisis, with artists torn between virility\nand vulnerability. Through transferring\nthe latter characteristic to female nudes,\nthe issue could be avoided.\nDespite its decline in popularity,\nthe 19th and 20th century saw greater\nfreedominourattitudetowardsthemale\nnude. Whilst the Impressionists\u2019 female\nnudes are well known today, artists\nsuch as Cezanne painted men frolicking\nnude (Baigneurs, 1890) and Caillebotte\u2019s\npaintings of men undressing have the\nsame voyeuristic qualities as Degas\u2019\nfemale nudes. The arrival of the realist\naesthetic also led to the representation\nof different body types in art, further\nchallenging traditional concepts of\nmasculinity. Egon Schiele\u2019s gaunt\nself-portraits are a far cry from the\nclassical nudes of old. Meanwhile,\nfemale and homosexual artists have\nprovided important perspectives that\ndeviate from the typical \u201cmale gaze\u201dartists such as Alice Neel paint men in\nreclining poses typically associated with\nfemale nudes, focussing on her subjects\u2019\nvulnerability. Andy Warhol\u2019s and Jean\nCocteau\u2019s sketches of male lovers are\nboth unashamedly erotic and lovingly\ntender.\nSo with today\u2019s freedom of expression\nin art, why are we still so uncomfortable\nwith the male nude? An obvious\nanswer is that the art industry is\nstill predominantly controlled by\nheterosexual men, who may prefer to\nogle females than self-scrutinize. It has\nalso been argued that viewing a male\nnude places us in the uncomfortable\nrole of the \u201cmale gazer\u201d\n. In a study\nwhere psychologist Beth A. Eck\u2019s\nassessed people\u2019s responses to male\nand female nudity, male nudes sparked\nfeelings of \u201clust mixed with guilt or\nshame\u201d in women, whilst many men\nadmitted to feeling uncomfortable. Why\ndoes the female nude not incite similar\nfeelings? Many have suggested that as\nthe male sexual organs are external,\nthey are more of an affront to the\nsenses; symbols of sexual aggression. By\ncontrast the female nude is \u201cneater\u201d\n. Yet\nart demonstrates that this is not so - the\nmale nude can be beautifully tender.\nThe art world is at last beginning to\nre-acknowledge the beauty of the male\nnude- recently the Leopold museum\nin Germany and the Musee d\u2019Orsay\nin France held exhibitions dedicated\nto artistic portrayals of the male form\n(Naked Man and Masculin/Masculin).\nHowever, somewhat ironically for a\nmuseum seeking to open our minds\nto male nudity, the Leopold museum\nwas asked to censor many of its\u2019\nadvertisement posters. In a society\nobsessed with female nudity, it is high\ntime that the male reclaimed equal\nstatus in art.\nWhat\u2019s that in the background?\nW\nhat are paintings\nall about anyway?\nIn the Renaissance,\npaintings mainly\nrepresent stories\nfrom Saints\u2019 lives, mythology and\nhistory. Mary and Jesus are big players\non the Renaissance canvas, mostly as\na mother and baby duo but also found\nas adults, with Jesus shown performing\nmiracles or wondering around doing\nbiblical stuff.\nYou might be familiar with Gerome\nand his lion, the former resembling a\nhybrid between Father Christmas and\nyour nicest tutor, the latter invariably\nlooking adorable. Other minor saints\noften feature, as do stories from the Old\nTestament and mythological characters.\nSo now you know- that\u2019s what\nRenaissance paintings mostly are about.\nBut is it? Building the Picture, a free\nexhibition at the National Gallery,\nchallenges the centrality of the figures,\nreminding the viewers that the\narchitecture in a painting is far more\nthan just a backdrop. By assembling\npaintings from its permanent collection\nwith a few loans (Sebastiano del\nPiombo\u2019s Judgement of Solomon\nfrom the Kingston Lacy collection\nand Verrocchio\u2019s Virgin Adoring the\nChrist Child from the National Gallery\nof Scotland), the exhibition walks the\nviewer through the role of buildings,\nstreets and squares in Renaissance\npainting.\nBuildings help tell the story, by\ncreating different backdrops for the\ndifferent characters. They tell you\nabout the relationships between the\ncharacters, by providing hierarchical\ngeometries or isolating certain figures in\nthe painting. Sometimes, buildings do\nmost of the story telling, by providing\nthe time dimension in the painting. By\nshowing ancient architecture, mixed\nwith modern buildings, mythological\nstories can be shown as happening in\nthe past while maintaining their real-world element.\nThe architecture of a painting can also\nbe used to draw in the viewer, including\nthe observer into the scene by creating\nside-line perspectives, in which you\nturn into a bystander, or by welcoming\nyou into a large open space like a guest.\nFinally, buildings give a fantastical\nor realistic feel to the scene, by\nreflecting true cityscapes (with which\ncontemporary observers were familiar)\nor by deliberately mixing architectural\nstyles anachronistically, creating made-up buildings for imaginary settings. In\na world in which moving images were\ninconceivable, the setting of a scene had\nto convey the temporal dimension, the\nreality of a situation and the relationship\nbetween characters and viewer. That\u2019s\na lot of work for a pile of bricks in the\nbackground!\nThe exhibition also helps explain the\nrole of painting in a city, by recreating\nthe position of a tabernacle in a street.\nBy showing an etching of the painting\nin its original location, this helps us\nunderstand the role that paintings had\nin a Renaissance city, in which small\npainting of saints were often to be found\non street corners and buildings.\nBut more than just learning about the\nrole of architecture in Renaissance art,\nvisiting this exhibition will give you an\nexcellent key to visiting early modern\nart galleries in general. It\u2019s easy for your\neyes to glaze over as you wonder around\nan art gallery, staring at painting after\npainting of Mary clutching baby Jesus\nor the three kings lined up neatly in\nfront of a crib. The characters maintain\ntheir characteristic posture and dress\nin most painting because that\u2019s how\ncontemporary viewers recognise them.\nRyan Gosling just wouldn\u2019t be the same\nwithout his slicked back blond hairdo right? Same thing for Mary and\nblue dresses. So what really changes in\npaintings are the objects and buildings\naround the figures: the setting and\nthe props are telling the real story. So\nnext time you walk into a room full of\nchubby looking babies, stiff looking\nsaints and far too many gold halos, don\u2019t\nback out looking panicked. Have a good\nlook at the real players, look at what\nthe buildings are telling you about the\npicture.\nWhat: Building the Picture:\nArchitecture in Italian Renaissance\nPainting\nWhere: National Gallery, WC2\nWhen: Until 21st September\nPrice: FREE\nClara Clark Nevola\nWriter\nDomenico Beccafumi, The Story of Papirius, mid 1520s\nNo Such Sweetness\nI\nn January of this year, the UK\nGovernment pledged to accept\n500 refugees from the Civil War in\nSyria. Oh My Sweet Land tackles\nthe other 2.3 million refugees\nwho don\u2019t have that \u201cprivilege\u201d. A\ncollaboration between Amir Nizar\nZuabi and Corinne Jaber resulted in\nthis play, inspired by their trip to the\nSyrian refugee camps in Jordan and\nhearing the stories of people in the\nharshest moments of their lives.\nA one woman show, Jaber plays a\nyoung Parisian with Syrian roots who\nfalls in love with Ashraf, a refugee\nfrom the Civil War. Guilty about\nleaving his family and haunted by\nmemories of the Syrian atrocities,\nAshraf disappears from Paris without\na word. In love with Ashraf and\ndesperate to form a connection to her\nSyrian roots, the young woman travels\nto the Middle East to find the answers\nshe needs. Meeting countless Syrians\non her way, Jaber recounts the stories\nthey tell her and builds a picture of\na civil war which has \u201cnothing civil\nabout it\u201d.\nWhen I went to see Oh My Sweet\nLand, I knew almost nothing about\nit, except that it was based on the\nSyrian civil war. I expected to hear\na woman pleading for people to\nacknowledge what is going on in Syria,\nto do something about the crimes\nof the regime and their opponents.\nBut instead, I found a woman simply\ntalking about the embarrassment and\npain of its people. With almost no\neffort, the play conveys a very simple\nmessage;thewestmighthaveforgotten\nabout the Syrians, but they\u2019re just like\nyou and me.\nWhile it is hard for us to understand\nwhat these people go through, what\nreally struck me was that while\nwatching this play, I felt embarrassed,\nand I almost felt responsible in part for\ntheir hardship. This may seem a little\noverdoing it, I know, I\u2019m not in any way\ninvolved, but the play did masterfully\nforce the audience to consider the role\neach individual plays in such conflicts.\nWhile the plot seemed somewhat\nfabricated in an attempt to frame\nthe stories of the refugees, the play\nmaintains a strong and damning tone\nthroughout which conveys the mood\nof the civil war better than any of\nthe plot in itself. Jaber\u2019s performance\nthroughout was certainly not flawless,\nbut it didn\u2019t have to be. What comes\nacross as somewhat rusty at times\nseems justified when considering quite\nhow damaged her character really is.\nI would have liked to see more of the\ndamaged side of Jaber\u2019s character and\nat times I felt there was a certain lack\nof conviction in her description of the\nstories people told her. However, what\nthe play lacked in detail is more than\nmade up for by the powerful stories\ntold throughout and the chilling tone\nfelt by the audience, from the first\nto the last minute of the play. A real\ncalling card by the Young Vic, this great\nsmall theatre has once again shown its\nability to give the stage a whole new\nface. While this won\u2019t go down as one\nof my favourite trips to the theatre,\nthis play is certainly a must-see for all\nthose who feel, like me, a strange need\nto understand the little details of the\nlives of people struck by such a terrible\nwar.\nMax Falkenberg McGillivray reviews a new one-woman play about Syrian refugees at the Young Vic\n\u00a9 Simon Annand\n\n"

This is until she figures out that he\u2019s a married\nman. Game of Thrones\u2019 Jaime Lannister, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, has\nbeen a busy man no doubt. His wife\nKate (Leslie Mann) is devastated and\nheart-broken. But with a little help\nfrom wine, tequila and vodka, the wife\nmanages to befriend \u201cthe other woman\u201d. Mark\u2019s (Coster-Waldau) affairs\ndon\u2019t end there however, as another\nmistress is added to the mix, this time\nsomeone who fits the cliched categories of blonde hair and big boobs.\nAmber (Kate Upton) is just as shocked\nand saddened by all this, and it takes\nthe three of them to realise that they\ndo not need a man in their lives to define who they are.\nIt\u2019s not long before the three team\nup to work together. Their united\ngoal? To take down Mark King and\nutterly humiliate him in the process.\nThe film works best when the three\nwomen are together on the screen,\nand less so when it clearly tries to\npush the biggest name star of the film,\nDiaz, to the front with her own little\nill-advised subplot. Kate\u2019s brother Phil\n(Taylor Kinney) is an eligible contractor who doesn\u2019t appear to give a damn\nhis sister was cheated on multiple\ntimes, but instead is more interested\nin hooking up with one of his brotherin-law\u2019s mistresses. Of course on film\nthe love line plays out in a more sug-ar-coated fashion than that - this is a\nromantic comedy after all, but for the\nsake of the actor playing Phil\u2019s part, as\nwell as giving Diaz a more substantial\nlove interest to play around with, it\u2019s a\nstrand that should have been thought\nthrough more carefully.\nMost interesting, hilarious and effective is Mann\u2019s character, the wife.\nBeing the hugely talented comedic\nactress that she is, Mann is almost\nsingle-handedly responsible for a large\nnumber of the film\u2019s laugh-out-loud\nmoments. Mann has slowly transformed herself from being a mere\nsupporting player to a lead actress\nreceiving the second highest billing\nof the cast. But it\u2019s not just her comic\nabilities that make her performance a\nstandout one. Through her there is an\ninteresting area explored, albeit brief-ly, concerning how it may not be the\neasiest thing to leave your husband,\nno matter who he has been sticking it\nto for all these years. A vow is a vow,\nand there was certainly a time when\nthe original couple must have loved\none another. In order to squeeze in\nmore humour to its running time, this\nis something that is only fleetingly\nglanced at, although Mann makes the\nmost of what little material she has to\nwork with. She even shows knack for\nsomething more serious and ground-ed, and it would certainly be interesting in the future to see her taken on\nmore diverse roles.\nCoster-Waldau, most famous for\nhis contribution to HBO\u2019s hit fantasy\nshow, shows off an entirely different\nside to his acting range, proving he is\nperfectly suitable for some over-the-top, slapstick comedy. A significant\nportion of very loud, physical comedy\nis dependent on his role, one he carries through effortlessly. A real sneaky,\nslimey, cheating bastard, Coster-Waldau becomes the perfect target for all\nthose involved, and a part of the film\u2019s\nfinal satisfaction is down to how little\nsympathy we actually have for him.\nAlso showing promise in front of\nthe camera is rapper Nicki Minaj, who\nmakes her debut film performance\nhere, as Carly\u2019s assistant Lydia, a character reminiscent of Karen Walker of\nWill & Grace, in that they are both\nuseless assistants who don\u2019t really do\nanything except insult their bosses.\nMinaj may not have what it takes to\ncarve out the most versatile career,\nbut in roles similar to this one, a wise-cracking, sassy young woman who\nwon\u2019t take any insults from anyone,\nshe would be the perfect character actress for such parts.\nFaring less well is Kate Upton, a\nmodel having a crack at Hollywood.\nIt\u2019s impossible to figure out whether\nshe is a good actress or not, because\nshe has so little to do throughout the\nfilm. She is always around, dancing,\nwalking, showing off her exceptional\nbody, but in such a thankless role,\nshe is heavily side-lined by those with\nmore experience. The film wants to\nsell the idea that it\u2019s the three women\nwho are teaming up to exact their revenge on Mark. But she may as well\nhave been written out completely.\nThe film is very keen to push the\nidea that these women share a beauti-ful, lasting friendship. Aside from an\nutter rubbish sequence that involves\nthe three women slowly gathering on a\nbeach, shooting their own little cheesy\nmusic video completely out of the blue\nin the middle of the film, the idea is\nmostly sold, thanks to its solid premise and a couple of the leads.\n\n"

For example,\nTurkey seems to be scored highly\nby German voters, possibly due to\nthe large number of Turkish people\nwho have migrated to Germany, and\npotentiallytelevotefromthere.Butour\nanalysis found no convincing evidence\nof negative bias or discrimination\nagainst anyone \u2013 no country really has\nany enemies.\u201d\n\u201cIn our analysis we used what we call\na \u2018Bayesian hierarchical formulation\u2019\nto model the scores,\u201d explained coauthor Dr Marta Blangiardo. \u201cWe\ntook into account factors like the\nlanguage of the song and the gender of\nthe singer both of which have known\neffects on the votes.

Fulham are a bit shit\nowing largely to their rubbish players\nand a lack of Michael Jackson, but\ntheir fans could use a win.\nPrediction: 8-5\nHull City vs Everton\nFA cup finalists Hull have no time\nfor Everton in this final day match\nand duly swat them like an old man\nbothered by flies.\nPrediction: 2-1\nLiverpool vs Newcastle Utd\nNewcastle significantly hampered\nthemselves in 2014 by agreeing to\nonly actually try in the first have of\nthe season.\nLiverpool could yet win the title\nbut that would require a huge favour\nfrom West Ham and they hate\nhanding out favours even though\nthey definitely still owe the Reds for\nthat time they got the Hammers out\nof that thing with that guy.\nPrediction 10-5\nMan City vs West Ham Utd\nWith Man City are expecting to\nwin the title and they will almost\ncertainly achieve it. However, the\nhate winning the title by clear points\ninstead preferring to rub their\nadversaries noses in it by taking the\ntitle by virtue of a slightly superior\ngoal difference.\nIn this vein, I fully expect them to\nbe 1-2 down until the 95th minute\nwhen James Milner (who else?) will\npop up with a 50 yard screamer.\nPrediction: 2-2\nNorwich vs Arsenal\nNorwich have been really, really a bit\nrubbish all season but then again so\nhave Arsenal in the Big Games. And\nthis is a Big Game. There\u2019s no game\nBigger than one in which neither\nteam can move position not matter\nwhat this result is or what any other\nteams result is. What a game.\nPrediction: 0-0\nSouthampton vs Man Utd\nA battle of mid-table, mediocre\nwills. That\u2019s right, neither team\nhas anything to play for and\nforever to play it in. In fact, the\nmost exciting thing to watch out\nfor in this match is whether Ryan\nGiggs will bring himself on only\nto be immediately subbed off by\nPhil Neville. For that alone, this is\nprobably the game to watch.\nPrediction: 2-1\nSunderland vs Swansea City\nThis is going to be a shit game ok?\nListen we would love it if all the\ngames every weekend were great\nand meaningful, but that\u2019s simply\nnot the case. Lets just fucking get\nthis prediction over with.\nPrediction: 2-fucking-1\nTottenham Hotspur vs Aston Villa\nWhatever else happens this game,\nwe can tell you that Spurs will\nnot be playing any of their most\nexpensive signings but will be\nplaying Michael Dawson for some\nreason. God, that guy\u2019s awful.\nAnyway look forward to some\ngreat sweeper-keeping, some\nterrible Villa play and Paul\nLambert\u2019s imminent sacking.\nPrediction 5-5\nWestBromichAlbionvsStokeCity\nEssentially, the last day of the\nseason is going to be extremely\nboring unless your a Man City fan.\nI guess that\u2019s the nature of a 38\ngame league, you are just going to\nhave seasons where the final day of\nthe season throws up both boring\nfixtures and boring scenarios.\nI mean sure, this game may be\nwatched by a few West Brom fans\nand, of course, the statisticians\nboth of whom are fascinated that\nWest Brom managed to stay up\ndespite basically not winning any\ngames all season.\nBut other than that, it\u2019s the\ndeadest of dead rubbers, like the\nkind you\u2019d find on the back of an\nold pencil. You know, the sort of\nrubber that never really worked\nanyway and that you probably\nchewed off or cut away with the\nblade of the pencil sharpener.\nAnyway, I probably ought to give\na prediction for this although it\nreally makes very little difference\nto anything or anyway, especially\nnot to West Brom or Stoke fans.\nPrediction: 1-2\nDavid Goldsmith, not doing anything\nagains the law, but also not doing\nmuch at all.\n\n"

    "content": "8 FRIDAY 09 MAY\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nBoosting your brainpower?\nUtsav Radia discusses new research on study drugs, and the problems they pose\nReseachers produce an even greener solar cell\nPavitar Devgon\nScience Writer\narchive.dailycal.org\nT\nhe London 2012 Olympics\nwas not just a very fruitful\nand lucrative opportunity\nfor the UK economy, which\nbenefitted from a \u00a39.9bn\nboost in trade and investment. It also\nplaced a huge responsibility on the\nanalytical chemists who had the job\nof identifying the drug cheats and\nkeeping the Games fair.\nNow, it seems, that the number\nof people relying on these chemical\ncheats for academic purposes is on the\nrise too. However, just how beneficial\nare these drugs for enhancing exam\nperformance?\nAccording to a study presented\nto the American Academy of\nPaediatrics, 18% of the students at\nan Ivy League College in the USA\nreported to misuse of a prescription\nstimulant (used normally in patients\nwith Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder; ADHD) at least once\nwhile studying, with 24% of students\nadmitting to have done so on eight or\nmore occasions. Not only that, but a\nthird of the students did not view this\nmisuse as actually \u201ccheating\u201d.\nThe use of such \u2018cognitive\nenhancing\u2019 drugs has been a hotly\ndebated topic over the past few years,\nespecially with increasing widespread\nprescription access to drugs such as\nmethylphenidate (Ritalin) and mixed\namphetamine salts (Adderall) being\nused for non-medical (or worse,\nacademic) purposes due to claims\nthat these can increase concentration,\nmemory and allow prolonged periods\nof attention whilst working.\nSuch classes of drugs are normally\nused in medical practice for patients\nwith narcolepsy, fatigue, shift-work,\nsleep apnoea (a form of sleep disorder)\nand psychiatric disorders such as\nADHD. Of the 616 non-ADHD\nsophomores sampled in the study,\n69% of those who misused stimulants\ndid so to write an essay, 66% to study\nfor an exam and 27% to sit a test.\nThe survey showed that nearly\nthree times as many students who did\nmisuse ADHD stimulants thought\nthat this was a common practice on\ntheir campus, compared to students\nwho did not. Evidence shows that at\nsome US universities, 7% of students\nregularly use these drugs whilst\nstudying and the trend is expected to\nincrease in the near future.\nInterestingly, these drugs are\nbelieved to principally benefit (as far as\ncognitive enhancement is concerned)\nthose individuals who already have\n\u2018below average\u2019 cognitive abilities. A\nnewer drug, modafinil, has shown\npromise by inhibiting inappropriate\nimpulsive responses and improving\nperformance when fatigue sets in.\nHowever, it has only significantly\nimproved certain types of memory\n(pattern recognition memory) and\nis associated with a multitude of\nside effects. Some of the main side\neffects of commonly used medication\ninclude headache, nausea, dizziness,\nsleeping problems and a decreased\nappetite. Although well tolerated by\nthe vast majority of people taking\nthe medications, in under 10% of\nthose affected, these events can be\nsignificant. Furthermore, the main\nworry is of the unknown side effects\nthat these drugs may present with in\nthe future, with increased and more\nwidespread use. Although ADHD\npatients may consider the side effects\nof such medication reasonable, is this\njustifiable in people who take them\nrecreationally or just to \u2018pass exams\u2019?\nPrinciple investigator for the study\ndone in the Ivy League College,\nNatalie Colaneri, agreed that this\nissue needs to be \u201capproached from\nan interdisciplinary perspective: as\nan issue relevant to the practice of\nmedicine, to higher education and\nto ethics in modern-day society\u201d.\nPerhaps, we ought to introduce a\nbranch of the World Anti-Doping\nAgency in schools as well, before the\nsummer exams.\nA\nnew solar cell is\nbeing pioneered\nby researchers at\nthe Northwestern\nUniversity, USA.\nRather than using lead perovskite as\nthe conductor to harvest light, the\nresearch team developed cells which\nutilise tin. The research paper was\npublished in the Nature Photonics\njournal earlier this week.\nThe main benefits of this structure\nare the low cost of manufacture and\nthe fact that it is more environmentally\nfriendly, as lead compounds are often\nhazardous and require specialist\nequipment to use safely.\nThe team was led by Mercouri G.\nKanatzidis, an inorganic chemist, who\nexplained their choice of materials:\n\u201cTin is a very viable material, and we\nhave shown the material does work\nas an efficient solar cell.\u201d Perovskite\nis an oxide mineral which are being\nused increasingly in the field of\nphotovoltaics. Lead perovskite solar\ncells can achieve an efficiency of\n15% and by replacing the lead in\nthe compound with tin, the team\nhopes to match or even surpass this\nbenchmark.\nWhile perovskite can appear\norganically, Kanatzidis has been able\nto synthesis a tin-iodide perovskite\ncompound. Collaborating with nano-scientist Robert P. H. Chang, they set\nabout creating a working solar cell\nfrom the material. The perovskite\nmaterials are used as light harvesters\nin the solar cell and using tin, the\nresearch team noted that the charge\naccumulates in the perovskite as well\nas in the electrode contacts. This\nled to a lower open-current voltage,\nwhich could be tuned by substituting\niodide atoms with bromide.\nComparison tests were performed\nbetween tin halide compounds\n(notably iodide and bromine) with\nlead counter parts. The optical\nbandgap in the tin-iodide perovskite\ncompound was measured at 1.3 eV,\nwhich is lower than the lead cells\u2019 1.55\neV. The absorption spectrum was also\nred shifted to a higher wavelength of\n950nm.\nWhile their tests were only able to\nreach efficiencies of just below 6%,\nthe manufacture process with these\nnew materials is an important starting\npoint, Kanatzidis believes. \u201cOther\nscientists will see what we have done\nand improve on our methods, here is\nno reason this new material can't reach\nan efficiency better than 15 percent,\nwhich is what the lead perovskite solar\ncell offers.\nTin and lead are in the same group\nin the periodic table, so we expect\nsimilar results.\u201d\nTrebuchet-magazine.com\n\n"

I\u2019ve got to admit,\nnot everything looked amazing, be\nit the colour reproduction of my\nphone (curry is not the most pleasant-looking dish ever), or just the lack of\nlighting in a restaurant.\nA few issues ago we reported that\nsome Michelin-star chefs hated food\nporn that much that they banned\ncameras in their restaurants. In\nSouth Africa though, they take a\nmuch different policy. A restaurant\nin Cape Town has introduced a new\n\u201cDinnerCam\u201d, which can only be\ndescribed as a portable photo studio,\nbut for food. It was actually used as\na marketing tool for a local telecom\u2019s\nnew unlimited WiFi plan, you can use\nit if you are signed up to the plan. And\nif you post the photo with the hashtag,\nit will get printed for you to take away!\nPersonally I think it is pretty neat,\nsomeone just needs to mass produce\nthese and make a fortune!\nSome things are just\nnot meant to be\u2026\nI went to visit the family over\nthe bank holiday weekend and my\nauntie got me a pack of chocolate\nwasabi peas. It is part of the Marks &\nSpencers Summer of Flavour range,\nother things include fruit jellies,\ncaramel sweets and even \u2018Mad Frogs\u2019,\nbut nothing as adventurous as the\npeas. My first impression was \u201cmeh...\nthat sounds weird\u201d, and my feelings\nsustained when I was biting through\nmy first one.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know\nmuch about wasabi (do you even\nexist?), it is essentially the Japanese\nversion of mustard. You might have\nhad some when you last had sashimi\nor sushi. I am a big fan of wasabi,\nespecially the kick it provides you\nwith which goes straight up your\nnose. I am also a big fan of chocolate,\nespecially how it just melts in your\nmouth and the \u201cgooey\u201d sensation.\nAnd who would hate peas? Nutritious,\ncheap and tastes amazing! Putting all\nthree together though, not so much.\nI\u2019m surprised to find that this idea\neven made it on kickstarter in 2012\nand $5000 was actually raised with 47\npeople backing the project!\nWhen I shared the peas amongst\nmy friends, there were mixed reviews.\nSome did like the sensation of spicy\nchocolate \u2013 I suppose it\u2019s just a\npreference thing. Lately I\u2019m really into\nsalted caramel \u2013 something which\nagain, sounds so wrong, but I actually\nlike it! Although perhaps we can also\ntake a philosophical view on this,\ndon\u2019t feel beaten if exams or projects\naren\u2019t going too well, don\u2019t give up and\nkeep going!\nSome things are just not meant to\nbe but keep trying \u2013 I still have high\nhopes for the future range of weird\nM&S snacks! Or I can put it in the\nwords of Nev, the CEO of the BBC\nThree show \u2018The Call Centre\u2019, \u201cSome\nwill, some won\u2019t, so what? Next.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s food for thought\n#Felixfood\nSomeone left their breakfast on Bayswater Road\nW\nho doesn\u2019t like\ncake? Even\nLatvia\u2019s entry\nto this year\u2019s\nEurovision was\nall about this sweet, fluffy and tasty\nfood! It is a wide misconception to\nthink cakes are hard to bake and it\ntakes up a long time. But we are here\nto prove that wrong.\nYes, baking a beautiful cake might\ntake patience and expertise, but if you\njust want some cake to satisfy your\nsweet tooth, it feels more like a science\nexperiment.Essentiallyit\u2019sjustmixing,\nmeasuring and shoving the whole\nthing into the oven! Here are two easy\nand tasty recipes, which can be made\nwith just a few cupboard ingredients.\nThe Magic Custard Cake\nThe magic comes with 3 layers\nof this bake, with just one batter!\nIngredients\nFour medium eggs\nOne tsp lemon juice\n150g caster sugar\n110g unsalted butter, melted\n120g plain flour\n480ml whole milk\nOne orange\nPreheat an oven to 160\u00b0C and line\na deep baking tray or a cake tin with\nbaking paper. Separate the eggs and\nwhisk the whites to a stiff peak with\na tiny drop of lemon juice. Beat the\negg yolks with the sugar and one\ntablespoon of warm water for a couple\nof minutes then add the melted butter\nand zest of the orange and mix again.\nSieve in the flour and stir through\nthe milk, then fold in the egg whites (in\ntwo batches), until evenly combined.\nPour the batter into the baking\ntin and cook for 50-60 minutes until\nthe top is golden and puffed and the\nmiddle is set but with a generous\nwobble.\nAllow to cool completely (at least\nthree to four hours) before slicing into\nthe cake.\nGreen Tea Cake\n(if you want something lighter)\nIngredients\nThree large eggs\n85 g sugar\nThree tbsps vegetable oil\nFour tbsp water\n75 g cake flour\nOne heaped tbsp matcha powder\nOne tsp baking powder\nPreheat oven to 170\u00b0C. In a large\nbowl, whisk egg yolks and add \u2153 of the\nsugar. Then add oil and water in the\nmixture and mix it all together until\ncombined.\nSift cake flour, matcha and baking\npowder together and add to the egg\nyolk mixture in three batches. Whisk\nuntil there are no lumps.\nWhip the egg whites until opaque\nandfoamy,thenadd\u2153oftheremaining\nsugar and continue whipping. Add\nthe remaining sugar slowly in small\nincrements until stiff peaks\nPull up your whisk and see if you\ncan make a strong \u2018peak\u2019 to check if\nthe mixture is stiff enough. It should\nstay up still without bending down.\nFold in the beaten egg whites into\nthe flour mixture using spatula until\nthe colour is consistent in the mixture.\nPour the mixture into a greased\ncake pan and tap it a few times on the\nkitchen top to release the air bubbles.\nBake for 30 minutes or until when\nyou put a skewer in, it comes out clean.\nTried these recipes?\nShare it with us:\n#FelixFood\nMichael Yat Kit Chung\nFood Editor\n\n"
