This machine would I am\nsure, be able to describe its owner in a far more colourful manner than I can;\nfor it bears several testimonials to his past career, one of them being a bras\nplate inscribed with the name 'Mohammed\nKassan' - an Arab he ran down in Tripoli docks.\nJolyon arrived at I.C. two years ago,\nhaving come via Oundle and the Army, and\nhis interests were im media tley aroused by\nthe Engineering Society. Beginning as\na year rep. he then became the Visit's Sec.\nHe organised an excellent year of Visits; culminating in the Easter Trip to lar is where 36 students were able to see something of the French industries etc\nfor an astoundingly low cost. He plays\nHockey for Guildford, and sometimes\nvillage cricket, also took part in organising the Cabaret in last years Guild' 3\nCarnival.\nHis activites in certain other fields mist, perforce, be left unsaid. However\nbis appreciation for the good things in life and his attachment\"\u2022 for the charms\nof the district led^to his being forced\nto occupy three different flats in Unslow Gardens in one year.\nHis year ended in a three month\ntrip to Canada to gain experience in his p hosen Profession of Civil Engineering,\nthis proved a huge success; enabling\nhim, among other things, to spend \u00a3150\nin one short weekend. he is quite\nid amant about returning there as soon\n\u00bbs possible.\nI am sure you will all join with\nBe in wishing him the best of luck in the strenuous and, we hope, memorable\nfear ahead of him.\nCOMMEMORATION BALL\nSome 486 paying and a few non-paying guests, danced tb the Music of\nthe Savoy Blue Room Orchestra, feta*\nthemselves on smoked salmon and fruit\nsalad, and drank the products of the\nmost 'U' Distilleries at Claridges on\nThursday last.\nThe Ball was held in what\nClaridges designate as the painted\nroom, although for many a beady\nI.C. eye it eo ul d be more aptly\nnamed. ,\nThere were a noticeable num ner of newly self elected governors\nwho breaking all the cork age \u201ea it e rPf of the house caused a worried water to remark \" I don't know where it comes\nfrom\".\nThe dancing although starting slow jy became spirited when the guests had\nreached that deli gate dynamic equilibrium\nbetween sobriety and paralysis!. Most\nJhoughtthat the Orchestra was good al though it was criticised for playing too\nmany slow placid quicksteps. However,\nthese suited everybody's dance style especially when lethargy set in about\n1.30 a.m.. The dance finished at 2.30 a.m. with a rousing. Auld Lang Syne, when people\nwent their various ways to the Hostel\nfor coffee, Covent Garden for breakfast\nand some merely to sleep.\nThe evening was a 'distinguished\nsuccess and served as a fitting ending\nto Commemoration Day.\nAll thanks are due to the\nBanqueting Staff of Claridges for a most excellent evening.\nPHOTOGRAPHIC\nSOCIETY\nYet another success has\ncome the way of the photographic\nsociety this year. It has just been\nannounced that Tony Ayoott has been\nawarded the first p rise in the FIRST\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENT SALON of\nPhotography in Hong Kong, with his\nprint 5Joan\". He is to be presented\nwith a cup, and the choice of a Japanese camera or an electronic\nflash unit and light meter. This print was placed first in the Society's own exhibition last\nyear, and was one of the panel of six\nprints which won the European\nUniversities title for our society.\nIn the latter exhibition it was one\nof the five highly commended\nindividual prints.\nTony, who recently left\nthe College, has been one of the most\nactive members of the society for\nseveral years, being the main stay\nof the portrait group. Besides his\nportrait work he has done most of\nthe stage photography for the LCD.S. and L.U.D. S. over the past few\nyears, and has done quite a lot of\nmodel and commercial photography.\nSKI CLUB\nFull details Ct> the Club's Tour of Switzerland this winter have\nnow been prepared. ?hey can be\nobtained from the Ski Secretary\ntho ough the Union Rack.\nThe main party will be flying from Gatwick, on Tuesday morning 29th December, to Geneva. Then on to\nSaaa Fee by rail. They return the\nsame way on Saturday 10th January.\nCost of travel Gatwick to\nGatwick and full board and lodging\nfor 12 nights will be \u00a329 to \u00a332\ndepending at which Hotel you stay.\nThe village is \"at 6,000 ft. with\nlift3 reaching up to 9,000 ft. Freshers are not able to take\ntheir cars as there are no streets\nin Saas Fee.\nI would like to point out that\nthe Club can only take 50, but to\ndate we have had over 90 enquiries.\nDon't leave booking until December.\nYou will be unlucky.\nPeter Odell.\nOld Hostel,Room 49.\nOBITUARY\nSIR HENRY T IZZARD Sir Henry Tizard spent thirteen\nyears between the wars and well into\nthe second World War as Rector of\nImperial College, He was far thinking in matters of education and as\nearly as 1935 developed a3che me for the expansion of the College. The\nBritish Government was not so science\nconscious in those days, however, and\nit was 20 year3 later that the present\nexpansion was adopted. The present\nstatus of the College owes much to the\nforethought of. Sir Henry, he was the\nfirst Rector to have 'Big Ideas' for the College, in those y^ ars when money\nfor academic expansion was extremely\nscarce.\nAlthough a prominent man, Sir Henry Tizard would talk to and listen to people of all sort3, sym pathis in gri th their views and using his wit, for which he waa well known, only to\nhumour and not to harm. There was\none exception, however, when referring to the attitude of the government to wards science he was quite devastating,\nand no doubt his critics m has done much\nto make the government more aware of the\nvital importance of science in the\nworld to-day.\n\n"

The A team wh i oh comprised\n1. D.H. miller. 2. A. J. Caves\n3. P. Aliacn. i \u00bbK.M. Raja\nwon its match 3-1 against Regent Street\nPolytechnic A team. The B tea a comprising\n1. R. Wills. 2, A Whltelook.\n3. a. Jane. 4 . UPlmaingtcn.\nwon its match 3-1 against the same\nclub'sB team.\nThe Club is looking forward to a session of increased activity but still has difficulty in finding teams against\nwhich to play.\nCan anyone help? If so, please\ncontact the Secretary through the\nUnion rack.\nFENCING\n\u2022\nThe fencing club has increased its membership this year and wo. are more confident in being able to carry out a rather\nambitious fixture programme.The club\ncaters for fencers of all standards and\nis running a large beginners cl as3 this\nyear. Anyone interested: in learning\nwould be very welcome and is advised\nto j^ in: now, since catching up on beginners ex cerci ses. is a very stiffening\nprocess.Professional instruction is given\nat the meetings held in the gymnasium,\non Monday evenings at 5.00p.m. and\nThursdays at 1,15 p.m. ICWSC\nSquash\nUnder the able leadership of\nSheenagh Wallace the I.C. W.S.C. registered its first victory with a fin* j' H win over U.C. last Wednesday.\nHookey\nDespite the fao t that the first nat ch against King's ended in a48\" defeat for I.C. we are pleased to\nannounce that Hilary Tompsett has\nregained her pla oe in the University\nIst team, and that 1st year botanist\nChristine Bragiel has been selected\nto represent the 2nd team.\nNetball\nAlthough we have been lucky\nsn ough to play several mato he s in the Chelsea PSLy gym and despite the\nfact that we have a promising team it is not encouraging to play in a gym\npacked with opposition supporters.\nSo why not give some verbal assistance at our next match (Nov. 23rd). RUGBY\nThe Rugby o lub is finally\nsorting players out to play the right\nstandard of rugby and a nucleus of\nplayers have already developed in many of the teams. This is a slow and\nlaborious job, however, for the officials\nand it has been hampered a great deal t this season by the apparent increase in\nthe number of people who cross of ft the team list late . The teams are posted\nup early in the week , and there is no\nreason why anyone should leave it to\nafter Thursday to cross off the list. Tuesdays and Thursdays\ntraining session in the Park have not\nyet been well attended. We must have\npeople out to train as one must be\nbasically fit to play the game well and\nenjoy it.( Training be fox w the game,\nbeer after it). It is imperative\ntherefore with the U.L. U. cup matches\ncommencing less than a fortnight hence,\nthat players must spend some time\ntogether; in the park keeping fit and\ngetting to know each others play.\nThe A fifteen have made what\nmust definately be described as a promising start to the season. Having\nnow played 3 games it had its first defeat last Saturday at the hands of a fairly strong Chelsea Paly 1 st XV.\nOn losing its stand off half five\nminutes after the resumption for the\nsecond half the remaining;fourteen men\n(only three of wh i oh belonged to the\noriginal team chosen) oo ul d not hold on\nto the five nil lead it had built up in the first half and was finally beaten by\na goal and a penalty goal to a goal\n(8 points to 5). The previous week the\nteam drew 16 points all with Wasps \"A\" at home and beet the N.P. L.\"A\" team on\ntheir ground in the first fall of rain\nfor many weeks. When the team thus\npicked actually play together then the\n\"A\" XV will be as good a side as a club\noo ul d wish for.\nOne last request before\nclosing this report must be made to\nthose who still have 1.8. jerseys and\nwho are not playing rugby for I.C. this\nseason. Will all suo h people hand in their jerseys to any official Of the Club,\nas we are still very short of jerseys.\nATHLETICS\nOn Wed. No 4that rial will be held\nin the following events 100,220,440,880\nand 1 mile in order to pick a team to\nrepresent the College is the University\nWinter Relays Competition. Also incorporated in this meeting will be the Field\nEvent competition for which the team has\nbeen posted on the Athletic Club not ioe board (see Cross Country Club Board).\nIf anyone not chosen for the Field\nEuents Competition would like atrial would he please inform me, K.W. Ludlam,\nvia the Union Rack before Nov 3rd. The time and vena e of the trial will be posted on the Board as soon as\nI can make the requisite arrangements.\nThe Winter Relay and Field Events\nCompetition will be held at 2.30 p.m. on Wed. Nov. 11th at Motspur Park, In\nthe past I.C. have not been able to\nproduce their strongest team, with a result that no success has been achieved\nCan we, this year, produce this success?\nSWIMMING\nDespite the a aw tax ti ott ef two\nw*S \u00bb players,and last year's Sougbborough Oollege captain,\n1,0. performed disappointingly\nIn our first match of the season \u00bb\nand were defeated by 9-4.Hr.\nWilliam MaoMlllan from Wogga?\nWegga,h*d obviously not reo eve red from his attack of bush fever,Baa ham\nand Oorrigan w red aoi ded ly unfit, while the rest of the team although\ntrying hard,just could not click.\nGoals for I.C, wears scored by Paris\n(2),Rushton, and Wilson.\nThe seo on d team, although they\ndefeated Chelsea, by 4-2, were also\n8i as. paw d ntl ng. The most attractive\nfeature being the promising debut\nof Canon,who in addition to soaring\n2 good goals,excelled in. the\nmidfield play.\nOn Wednesday IVth Ootober the Judo Club\nhad its first match of the season at\nSandhurst.We lost the.match 5-1 with one\ndraw.This is not a very encouraging star\nto the season,one main trouble was, as\nusa al after the summer vacation, unfit-ness. This will perhaps spur the team td\nget into for n rf or the next match.\nThree I.C, men have secured places\nin the U.L. team and a loo in the SouthEastern regi on .Fortunately none of the\nmatches will coincide with I.C. fixtures\nso we should be able to field our full team for all matches.\nDuring the summer vacation\nthree of the College Fireflys were taken\naway to various open meetings. At the\nNational Firefly Championships, held thi\nyear at Plymouth, G.C. Taylor showed up\nwell sailing F.2168 Fiasco.

I.C. has yet\nagain retained its good name in this\nfield of sport.\nOur arrival back to college\nwas not, however, very heartening as we\nfound that someone had pulled the plug\nout of the Welsh Harp reservoir.\nBritish Waterways had in fact\nbeen running water into the Grand Union\nCanal all summer and we were left with\na lot of mud and very little water.\nSailing is possible on a limited so ale and several of our more\nstalwart members, together with many\nkeen Freshers, have managed to launch\nboats on most Wednesdays and week ends.\nAn instruction course is being run and\nteam trials were held last Sunday, as a result of which teams are now being\nselected for our first match on the 7th and 8th of November.\nWe would ask all interested\npersons, be they Freshers or old lag3, to bear with us during this difficult time and assure you that with the return!\nof the water we will provide sailing and\nracing for all who are keen. Meanwhile\nmaintain an oe work is being carried out\non the boats and help would be\nappreciated.\nSmall Ad.\n700,000,000 gallons of water required.\nAny suggestion.\nCommodore Sailing Club.\n\n"

    "content": "1X LE Xv8 Our expedition in the Bolivian Andes\nreally got under way on the,day that the\nmules arrived from the little Indian village Of Pelechuco to carry our food and equipment into the mountain area.\nOur exp i editions aims, successfully\ncarried out in six weeks'* at sub-zero\ntemperatures, were to map and climb some\nof the almost unknown 18,000 and 19,000ft. peaks in this sparsely populated border\narea between Peru and Bolivia. The three geologists in the party\ncom; let eda geological survey of 3ome300 square miles of the rugged country stretching]\nright down to the steaming jungles of the\nAmazon basin, while the others worked\ntogether to produce the first ever map\nof 170 square miles of the main mountain\nji as s. Copies of this map are now avail able in London for the Imperial College\nExploration Board and the Mount five rest foundation - which jointly financed the\nproject - and for the Bolivian Government and the Royal Geographical Society.\nApart from the mapping, the expedition\nBonquered 11+ hitherto un climbed peaks,\nt ach of them over 18,500ft. We had arrived at the Apolobamba\nby way of La Paz, the Bolivian capital, tdi ich nestles in a huge hollow in the\nBolivian alt i plano( plain) 13,000 ft. ft bo ve sea level. Dominating the bustling,\nno dern city where the brightly dressed\nIndian women all wear gay coloured bowler\nft at s are the looming shadows of the ice peaks of Ill i mani,a giant 21,000 ft. mountain that looks almost close enough\nto touch but is actually25 miles ef is tant. There were, incidentally, nostalgic\nmemories in La Paz and many of the smaller\ntowns for our leader Dr. Geoffrey Bratt,\nof Hobart, and myself. The clear, high*\naltitude air carried a strong smell of\neucalyptus from\"the thousands of gum trees\nimported from Australia.\nTravelling out of La Paz by t iru ok, as were soon bouncing across the desolate,\ntreeless wastes of the highlands leading\ninto \u2022 the ApbloeesS jb a. Occasionally we\nWould pass\" an IndLlh's loaded antique\nlorry heading back for the city, one in\nparticular had, a load of ice aboard hacked\nfrom a glacier on a nearby* mountain.\nThe ioe, found a ready sale in the open-air markets of La Paz.\nAPOLABAMBA.\nThis was the land of the llama and\nthe alpaca, sturdy sheep-like animals\nwhich roam in nimble-footed flocks over\nthe mountains, partly domesticated by\nsemi-nomadic Indian for wool and meat.\nOne of the toughest climbs we tackled\nwas the 18,100 ft. east Soral leak. A long approach to it from our main food\ndump entailed crossing the big Azucarni\nglacier, criss-crossed with dangerous\ncrevasses.\nOver the glacier, the four of us,\nGeoff Bratt, John Jenkinson, Arthur Smith\nand myself, set up out two tents r on a narrow ledge of rock high above the valley. Opposite towered the south face of the\neast Soral leak, with ice falls dropping\nnearly vertically from the cone-shaped\nsummit to the glacier below.\nIt was a far more forbidding prospect\nthan we had imagined, so the following morning a recon no it ring party went out\nto find another approach. They were back\n36 hours later, after weathering out a driving snow storm through the night, with\nthe news that the north-east side looked\na more likely prospect.\nIt was a strenuous march, with\neight day's food and fuel for the stoves\non our backs. Climbing with 60 lb. loads\nin the thin air at 17,000 ft. is incredibly\nhard work and any slight over-exertion\nleaves one gasping for oxygen.\nWe camped under the east ridge that\nnight. Par away to the north, beyond\na cluster of blue lakes sparkling like jewels on a necklace, was the dark eree n of the Amazon jungle.\nTwo reconnaissances decided us at\nfirst on an approach from' the east ridge,\nbut this was forestalled in the last\n1,000 ft. of the ridge by huge cracks in the ice and formidable overhanging cornices.\nNext morning we tried the more direct route on the northern face which had\noriginally been rejected because we d is trusted the rotten, or loose, rock which\nwould have to be cro s3ex$. We started\nout in the biting iy cold air just after sun-up, aiming to climb a steep ice gully Reading to a narrow rid ce about\n1,000 yards short of the summit.\nRoped together for safety we pushed,\nslowly on, until it became clear that\nthis way, too, was so ing to be a little difficult. The only remaining alternative was\nto climb the great 300 fit. rock face\nitself. After two hours of sometimes\nmoot ma, or THE\nWOOD E AKLOtAMM\ndelicate work leading out up to 80 ft. at a time on the strong nylon ropes\nwe had reached the top of the face und eia projecting shelf of rook. Moving\ncarefully from there on alternate ice and rock, we reached the base of the\n300 ft. conical summit.\nWe stopped to put on cramp on s en\nsharp metal spikes strapped to the\nrubber sole of each boot - and, cutting,\noccasional steps with the ice axes,\nmoved up the last few feet to the\nsummit. Around us was a gigantic three-dimensional map of mountains,\nglaciers and, far away to the north-east, the jangle dabbled with after noon c? iud.\nIt was the moment that makes all the hard work seem worthwhile, in an\nincomparable setting and from a vantage\npoint nobody had ever attained before.\nIn these altitudes large quantities\nof paraffin were needed for cooking.\nIce has to be melted to water, and as\nboiling point is only between d G and 'JO\ndegrees Centigrade nothing cet s cooked\nvery well, particularly the dehydrated\nfoods on which we were mainly living. The party rose early next morning\nto be on the glacier before the sun had\nstarted to soften the top crust and\nafter several hours' climbing we made\nthe ridge at the head of the glacier.\nProm there cramp on s had to be used::\non the hard ridge ice all the way to the summit. The last 200 feet was st if going on steep ioe dropping almost\nstraight down 3,000 ft. to the glacier below, but we made the top by midday.\nThe return down the glacier proved\nvery tiring a3 by now the top crust of\nfrozen snow had melted and every few\nsteps we would break through and sink\ndown almost to our waists. So we\nfloundered rather than walked back\nto the tents where a \"billy\"was soon\non for welcome drinks all round. Only\ninside, away from the dazzling rays of\nthe sun, foul d one discard the dark\ngoggles, without which, in these\nconditions, one would be quickly snow-blinded.\nSix weeks after leaving La laz we returned, bearded and incredibly filthy, to be given a wonderful\nreception by the local Club Andino\nBolivia no and the British Emba33y,\nboth of which had given the expedition\na great deal of voluntary help right from the planning stage before we left England. As conspicuous as a bunch\nof tramps at a deb ball, were made guests\nof honour at an embassy garden party\nattended by several of the diplomats\nin the capital and their, wives. It was a fitting way to end it all. MTU, MK LB Or rRNa. "

President John\nForster handled interruptions to his excellent opening speech with ease.\nProfessor Blackett, speaking next as a special, n fim st of the R.C.S. Union,\nreceived the attention that a man as\ngreat as he deserves.\nIntroducing the next guest\nForster said\" I am almost frightened to\nhand you over to the next speaker -gentlemen Mr. Dennis Leston......now\nanything can happen\".\nIt nearly did! Lestcn at\nease in a smoke laden concert hall was\nnow completely out of his depth and\ndeserved, and was perhaps playing for the bar racking he got. He ended ad is a pointing speech with an allusion to his numerous immersions on previous\nMorphy Days, illustrating the point by\ndrenching the occupants of a nearby\ntable with beer, aimed so well it might\nhave been rehearsed.\nPerhaps rising to Leston's tacit\" this is too dull\" theme but\nperhaps not pleased at having beer soaked\nsuits, neighbouring R.C.S. men\nretaliated, and in the ensuing melee\nJolyon Nerve was caught by a spray of\nbeer, he left disgusted.\nLeston continued as before,\nbut was cut short by the R.C.S. President whose own feelings on the\nincident are best indicated by his later apology to Jolyon Nove.\nHe wrote: \" I apo logos e on\nbehalf of the E.C. S. Union far the\nregret able incident which lead to your\nleaving our Freshers Dinner. I admired your action and endorse your\nfeelings on the subject of Freshers\nDinners.\nYour expert handling of Guilds'\nDinners this year has made them some of\nthe best in recent years.\nI would like to add that, had\nyou been able to stay, I'm sure that\nyour impression would have been\ndifferent. I would like it to be\nknown that Professor Blackett greatly\nenjoyed his evening with the students.\nCOMMEMORATION\nDAY\nThe Commemoration Day\nceremony held in the Albert Hall was little different from its predecessors. The event would be\nfar more popular if some way of\nspeeding up the presentation of the\nAssociateship was evolved. As it was, by the time the Rector rose to\nmake his speech many of the audience\nin ol u ding your correspondent were\nalready nodding sleepily in their seats.\nThe main theme of the\nRector's Report waa that \"The College\nis in a state of rude and vigorous\nhealth\". The truth of this is mani fest around us. Sir Patrick went\non outlining the many events of the\npast year, all leading to one conclusion - expansion, and left his audience with the impression that\nthey were to be the founder members\nof something very big. The special visitor this year was Lord Tfeeks. Sneaking at\nI.C. for the seu on dt in s in a fort night, this gentleman of many distinctions delivered a speech which\ncontained a number of extremely\ncogent ideas.\nUnfortunately the delivery was poor,,\nno doubt contributed to by the\nappa linga coo us tics in the Albert Hall,-and did little to arouse his\naudience from a somewhat somnolent\nstate, Indeed earlier on a mention of Bo had brought forth only\na merest pattering from the assembled\nGuildsraen.\ns nw mm mnm Lord weeks spoke at some\nlength about \"leadership\" pointing out that the scientist of to-day will most probably be the leader of to tomorrow, provided that he obtains\nthe breadth 01 interest and understanding that is so necessary. \"On\nthese aspects of a man hangs his ability to secure the allegiance and\ntrust of his fellow men and women,\nfor the prime test of leadership,\nis in dealings with people!.'\nAt this point it should be\nnoticed that among the many eminent\nmen receiving honorary fellowships\nwas Sir Lewis Casscn, many years ago\nan engineering student at this College\n- a man who has truly reached the\nbreadth of interest and understanding\nmentioned, in a multitude of fields. Lord Weeks finished with a quotation from \"A great headmaster\nsome fifty years ago\" - one which we\nwould do well to remember - .\n\" All I desire would be this; that there should continually go\nforth from this College a steady\nstream of young men and women,\ndesiring in perfect simplicity and\nself-renunciation to do their work\nfor God and Queen and neighbour\".\nIan D. Hill. "

Jass appreciation in the\n\u00a9allege has o or ream on d ingly increased\nAfter excellent talks,concerts,and\ninformal sessions throughout the year,\nthe hig as pat was reached with the Jass\nHop, which featured the music of Al\nFaixweaAher-Sandy Brown All-Stars,\nthey swung throughout^ to the delight\nOf hundreds of dancers.However,some\nsalve idiot has since complained that\nthey never played a waits.\nWeekly record recitals will he\nheld again this year, featuring well\nknown j az s artists, critics,\nintellectuals and illiterates. The\nclub is also having Thursday evening\nsessions, starting soon this term, tc\nprovide live rau sic for listening and\ndancing (admission will be entirely\nFHEB). At these, the tired science\nstudent will be able to proceed Jazs\nwise until he reaches absolute\nexhaustion.\nMOTORING\nThe main activity of the\nGuilds motor o lub is at present\nconcentrated on preparing their 1902\nJames and Browne car Boanerges for\nthe Annual Vetorto oar club Brighton\nrun on November 1 st.\nThe engine has been re-sleeved and is not yet reinstalled\nin the chassis and, same routine\nmaintenance has also to be done\nbefore the run. As usual Bo will\nbe accompanied to Brighton by a crowd of Gulldsmen who will assemble\nat Clerges Hotel for their annual\nBrighton run dinner together with\nthe crew of Jezebel from R.C.S. The run starts around 7.39\na.m. on the Sunday and competitors\nexp eot to reach Brighton around mid-day. If you o an summon up the\nenergy to see the oars off in the\nmorning you will be treated to a memorable sight.\nRene Guerster, Guilds Rally\nSecretary will compete this week-end\n(October 24th25 th)in the inter-varsity rally. Clerk of the o our se for this is Guilds motor o lub captain\nJohn Puttiok aided by several other\nGuildsmen as me rata la. This rally\nis a tough 300 mile closed event over\nsome rough country in Wales. For\nthose who want an easy introduction\nto rallying, Guilds will hold a treasure hunt at the end of November;\nall members of I.C. are welcome--^no\ncompetition licence i a required.\nThe Freshars have provided\nseveral talented ma aio ian s, including\nan excellent and much needed undergraduate trumpet player. It is hoped that the club will be able to\nmaintain one traditional and one\nmain stream outfit, besides two\nexisting small modern groups, and the\nnewly farmed Folk SohH group (the\nword \"skiffle\" went out of fashion\nlong ago).\nThis year the club intends to\nwin all sections of the W.U. S.j a as band competition, (last year the\ntraditional band cams second, on\nnormal form it would have undoubtedly\nwon) and also to enter the inter\nUniversity competition, if financially\npossible.\nSeveral lunch time Jazz concerts\nwill be held this year - in the past,\nthese have been the only entertainment\nto pack the concert, since Gypsy Rose\nLee did a complete strip there in\n1910. Dennis Leston, visitor to\nI.C. and ex-Jazz Club president, has\npromised his personal appearance at\nthese concerts and at other jazz club\nsessions, and meetings. Nothing\nmore need be said about this,\nIt seems likely that\noo lle ge jazz groups will once again\nbe in great demand to play at hops,\ncarnivals, formal balls, and so on.\nThis will give playing members a a hano e to beat the carnival record\nestablished by an eminent ex-president\nwho played swinging piano for 10\nhours before eventually collapsing.\nCOLUMN A strangely moving sight,|\nseen several weeks ago, was John\nFarnsworth entering College with an\nancient trombone. This completes\nthe formative stage of an experimental\ngroup, consisting of bamboo flute,\nbongos, trombone and man-hole cover;\nAnyone far tennis?\nBEAUTICWARIAN\nNol\nJUDY WRIGHT It would appear that\nthe hostel furniture designers\nhave meet their match at last;\nth. occupant of room Ko. has\nhad his bed replaced after only\none week in res i a eno e. Methinks that we have a future\nMr. I.Q. W.A. here.\nThe fact that the\npresent Mr. I. fi.W.A. has returned\nhis \"constant companion\" to the\ncustody of their President has\nshattered all feminine hopes\nthat he is standing for re-election. It is rumoured that\nthis may have some connection with\nwith the fao t that a not ioe has\nappeared an his door stating\nthat \"Ewart has lost all interest\nin sex\".\nCongratulations to\nClaire Broakea and Tony Oliver*\nwho, this summer, proved that\nanything is possible under water\nand are now engaged as a result.\nWhat a bunch of \"old\nlags\" walked up for their\nD.I.C' s on Com me mm, Day in the\nAlbert Hall; one ex\u2014president\nof U.

World University Service first began its work in1920, when an the\nmidst of the rubble and ruin of Europe,\nEuropean Student Relief( E.S. R.) was\nfounded to meet the critical material\nneeds of University students after the\nFirst World War. This type of work\nexpanded with the help and under the\nguidance of the two emerging bodies,\nthe International Student Service and\nWorld Student Relief, until1950 the\nI.S. S. and W.S.R. merged into the\nintegrated programme of i. or ld University der vice. Since 1\n9\n5\n0\n, this programme has\ncontinued to provide the means through\nwhich University men and women -have been\nable to combine their efforts to help\nwhere needs are greatest. While the\nmain emphasis has-been turned towards\nlong-turn undertakings to solve basic\nproblems in South-East Asia, the Far\nEast, and Kiddle-East, other projects\nhave been carried out to help tackle\nimmediate situations of need in these\nregions as well as in Africa and Europe.\nParticipation of University Communities\nof seven major areas of the World in joint activites to jr ovid i* material\nassistance has inevitably and increasingly led to important new contributions towards the process of education for international understanding and collaboration. The cardinal feature of all the work\ncarried on by W.U. S. since 1\n9\n2\n0 has been\nthe principle that international aid to students and universities in need is neither careless charity nor prejudiced\npolitics. Ability and proven need alone\nare the criteria, and aid is provided\nwithout discrimination on grounds of race,\ncreed, nation ail it y, sex or social conditions. ir ogram mes are administered\non sound economic grounds and in developing self help projects, univers ivy students and staff wh., might never have\nmet come together ineffective co-operation,\nYOU THROUGH WUS\nUNION MEETING At the last Union meeting a motion\nwas placed before the house asking\nmem be jsa of the Union to reject last year's Council decision regarding the\ndistribution of proceeds from any\ncharity carnival run by I.C. The\nCouncil's decision was that instead of\nsupporting W.U. S.,I.C. students would\nestablish a hospital bed in St.George's Hospital, since it was the general\nopinion of the 20-odd members of Council\nthat W.U. S. was too nebulous in form,\nand insufficient information about its activities was relayed back to the\nCollege in return for the efforts made\non its behalf.\nThe j see pose r,3yd Lenssen, and hi3 supporters argued mainly along the lines\nthat the proposed 'support of the bed'\nalthough pleasing and desirable was\nshort-sighted in view of the other\nworth while, more relevant and needy n* charities which exist. The motion was\npassed by an enormous majority, leaving\nuntil the next Union meeting the decision\nas to where the money should go.\nObviously from the support received and\nalso because of prior connections, W.U. S. will be a strong claimant for the proceeds.\nFelix has therefore decided to give W.U. S. an opportunity to clarify its position and\npublicise its activities.... TO THIS HELP OTHER STUDENTS\n* \u2022 \u2022\nwy\nIN HEED OF YOUR HELP?\nFor those interested it is hoped\nto arrange a visit by Dr. KaloolmIviitchell on Thursday 12th Uov. when\nhe will give an address on the Work\nand Aims of World University Service,\nAmple opportunity will be allowed\nfor questions. It is also hoped\nthat a film on the work of '\nA or Id\nUniversity Service produced by the\nAmerican Co-operating Committee \u00abili\nbe shown.\nW.U. S. PLUS I.C.=? It is obvious how useful a contribution\nof approximately 5500 is to any charity. In the case of World University Service\nthis money would be used in a wide programme both at home and abroad. Among\nits activities in this country W.U. S. is an active and founding member of\nthe British Student T.B. Fund, it runs\nva oat ional exchange course for about 30C students annually, and has a revolving loan fund. Abroad, problems on student\nhealth,lodgings, education facilities, and emergency aid are tackled with vigour\nand enthusiasm.\nA decision to reject W.U. S. in favour of some other body will unfortunately be taken at home and abroad as\na vote of no.confidence in our only\ninternational university organisation.\nHow will a 'student who has been treated\nor depends for his continued good health\non aW. U.S. Hospital, (not just a hospital bed) react on learning that\nImperial College has rejected' its resp on sibi lit y. Such a decision oo ul d be reached by Union Meeting swayed by\nthe eloquence of a good speaker, indeed\nit was reached by Union Council. This\ndecision should be made by you alone\nand not be the result of petty wrangles.\nBalance the issue in your mind, and let Imperial College students help other\nstudents to help themselves.\nTO HELP THEMSELVES.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX7 GROSS COUNTRY\nOn. Wednesday 14th several members\nof the e lub took part in atrial for\nthe University College Belay at Parliament Hill Fields. This was combined\nwith a match against Borough Road Training College wh i oh we lost owing to the\nover oen fide no e of the e apt a in who\nnominated the last ten I.C. runners to\nscore against the first ten of Borough\nHoed.\nThe U.C. Relay proper took place on\nthe following Saturday the o our se being\n6 x1i miles approx. The first team o a me second to Birmingham University with\nSouihampton University a close third. The\nsecond team did well to finish ninth\nand the third team plodded along to take\nup 18th place.\nTwo separate fixtures were held on\nWednesday the 21st. The second team went\ndown to our home o our se at Petersham to\na ot as hosts to a team from Shoreditoh\nTraining College. The going was hard and\nthe times were fast, several members recording personal best performances for\nt he course. I.C. won with a score of\n34 to Shoreditoh's46. Well up in the fi nal positions were I. Bennett (2), C. Huntley\n(4), A. Bigg (5), C. James (6), P. Auton ( 7 ) .\nThe remainder of the Club travelled\nto Mitcham for a mob match with Kings\nCollege and L.S.E. This was also won, the\nscores being 35, 45 and 141 respectively.\nNotable performances were those of J. Collins ?1}, M. Berber (2), D. Hammonds ( 4 ) ,\nA.. Brown ( 5 ) .\nOn Saturday 24th several members took\npart in the annual mob match\u2014University\nof London vs. Polytechnic Harrers over 5 i miles at Parliament Hill fields. This\nwas combined with the first of an amber of forthcoming league matches arranged\namong the London Colleges. Full results\nfor this match are not available at the\ntime of going to press. As before, the\ngoing was fast and good times were\nrecorded.\nLAWN TENNIS\nThe I.C. Tennis Club finished\nlast term having had its most successful season in recent years. It now remains dormant until the summer, except\nfor the usual series of oo a oh ing lessons\ngiven' by Captain Rodgers at his courts\nat Sydenham. Preparations are being made\nhowever far a proposed tour to take place\nnext summer, if the Union's finances\npermit.\nIn contrast, the Constituent College\nClubs are buzzing with activity, under\ntheir respective captains, I.C. Cameron,\n(H. C.S.),A. Netheroott, (C.46.), and\nD. Zimmermann (R.S. M.). Kaon has an impressive list of fixtures against other\nLondon colleges.\n, The inter-oo lle ge trophy, the\nBrown Cap, is this year being played\nfor -aid era new league system, in wh i ohs a oh college plays each of the others\ntwice. Both R.C.S. and Mines hare\nstrong hopes of breaking the monopoly\nwhich Guilds have had over this event\nduring the past dozen years.\nTABLE TENNIS\nLast sea sea the table tennis\no lub was moderately successful, under\nthe captaincy of \"Chick1\n' Brans, a brilliant all round sportsman. There\nare at present no officials of the club\nJohn Ponsford and I are acting in a' caretaker1 capacity and we shall hold\nelections very soon.\nPractically all the first and\nsecond team members left us, but we\nthink that among the Freshers we* have\nseen some promising players.\nSo far we have 50 members and\nhave entered 6 teams in the U.L. T.T. league. We hope to have a ladder, and\na knock out competition to encourage\nmembers to get together.\nFrom the enthusiasm shown by\noar members, we look forward to a very\nsuccessful season.\nSQUASH\nThe o lub was away to an early\nstart, and 15 ladder a ea have already\nplayed in representative matches. The\n1stV started badly when they went to\nLeicester University. Bans Espig and\nGef Bullock gave us a good start, both\nquickly adapting their game to the fast\no our t. Fresher Dos Webb had the best\ngame of the afternoon, all his games\ngoing to 10. He was un luo ky not to\nhave the decision, reversed. Secretary\nPeter Odell ran a long way but not\nnearly far enough. Skipper Brian\nHaywood forgot how to serve, and o a me in for some rough punishment because of\nit. Leicester have a new Union building\nwh i oh is extremely spacious having\nsquash o our ts on the ground *1o or. Their numbers are Just over a thousand,\nbut this building would put ours in the\nshade. The o our t's speed was the same\nis any internal o our t.......... fast.\nThe 1stV has also won matches\nagainst Kings, London (3-2) and Keeble\n0a ford'((50). The latter was notable\nfor the return of Brian Avient at\nnumber one, and the convincing win of\nBrian Jarman, ex-Cambridge man.\nThe 2nd V have a lot of matches,\nthere will be a report of them neat time.\nMany members are still not fit enough (the skipper has been seen circuit\ntraining).\nSquash Club Evening.\nMonday evening has been set\naside for the o lub evening. No o our ts are book able in advance. Everyone is welcome. The following are the objects\nof this evening*-(1 ) For beginners to meet beginners.\n(2) For beginners to lear a the rudiments\nof the game from 1stV players.\n(3) For everyone to have a chance to\nSay someone better than himself.\n) For new members, in order that they\nhave an evening on wh i oh they know they\nwill be able to meet o lub officials and\nplayers.\nFinally, I would like to say\nthat the s qu as n courts are definately\nnot cooing down this year or in the near\nfuture.\nMembers of the Boat Club in Training\nBOAT CLUB\nThis year the Boat Club welcomes\nover 40 fresher s who are already learning their rowing from the beginning\nunder the tuition s of more experienced\nstudents ( l) Enthusiasm is very high at\npresent, although punctuality oo ul d be\nimproved, and is always important. Novioe oarsmen should remember that it take\ntime to do anything that is worthwhile,\nand to make a good oarsman takes a lot of patience as well.\nAll three colleges have Morphy and\nLowry crews training at 7\u00ab45 a.m. three\ndays per week, and the standard again\nappears to be high. Great pains are\nnecessary to ensure that rival crews do\nnot get too close together on the river\nand Mines are sending out running spies\nto report progress on the other two\nboats. A slight majority of opinion fa v ours R.C.S. for the Morphy, but possibly\nGuilds being the holders, will have the\nedge on the day.\nAfter Morphy day, I.C. training\nwill be uninterrupted, and there are\ngood prospects of five crews rowing in the summer term. Good news for fresh-ers: in the words of Captain Jerry\nCaddy \"No seat in the first three boats\nis safe.\"\nBADMINTON\nThe club at the moment is suffering\ngreatly from lack of playing space.\nHowever attempts are being made to sec ur \u00ab\nthe Concert Hall for club play and if these are successful the present overcrowding of the gym o an be avoided.\nTo date three matches have been\nplayed. The first team were un fortuna t not to win against U.C. cn the 14th Oct.\nthe result being U.C.5 and I.C.4. Last Saturday both l st and 2nd teams\nhad matches and unfortunately they coincided with the Wimbledon Tournement in\nwh i oh several of our better players were\ntaking part. However despite this drawback the l st Team succeeded in beating\nQ.M. C. away by 6-3 while the depleted\nsecond team jj just failed to secure\nvi story against Goldsmiths by losing\n5-4.\nOn paper therefore the results so\nfar do not look very encouraging.\nLOST 2\nWoN1 "
