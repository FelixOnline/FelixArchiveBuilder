The glass-fronted wall\nboxes containing the keys to\nthe locked fire escape doors\ndid in fact contain nothing\nmore than fresh air, and so\nthe only escape was via the\nground floor entrances, i.e., past the fire and through the\nsmoke \u2014 good job it wasn't term time! Moreover, there\nare no fire alarm points in\nany of the Beit Quadrangle;\nthe alarm bells in Beit Hall\nare set off by a push button\nin the Security guard's office\n\u2014hard luck (good frying??)\nif the man is on his rounds\nand the office locked This\nfire may speed up the installation of proper fire alarms\nand escapes in the Hall.\nAlso on this subject, a quick FELIXCHECK on the\nUnion building last Saturday revealed that the chances\nof anyone in the top floor\ndisco escaping in the event\nof a serious fire are about\nthe same as those of the oft-quoted snow cat chased by\nan asbestos dog through\nHell. It's about time .that the\nEnts Committee and other\nUnion officials sacrificed (the\ncost of a few gatecrashers in\nfavour of taking all those\nchains off doors at dances.\nDoing the Lambert Walk Pay More, See Less\nAccording to all the\nhump h there should have\nbeen a Union meeting last\nThursday at 1.00 p.m. However, there was only about\nhalf a quorum and Martin\nBlack was sitting in the\nthird row, so it wasn't opened. Instead, there was a meeting of I.C. students.\nGeorge Assimakis gave\nthe up-to-date news on\nNightline, which is reported\nelsewhere in Felix.\nJudith then explained\nabout Union participation in\nthe choice of Halls wardens\n\u2014(the one in the pipeline at\nthe moment being Selkirk.\nThe procedure is that the\nUnion is asked for comments\non the shortlist\u2014the snag\nbeing that the Union officials\ngiven this confidential information do niO t necessarily\nknow all the candidates. An\ninterview system has been\nsuggested and is under con-side ration. We were told that college\nhours next year will remain\nas they are (9.30-5.30)\u20147\nout of 10 departments and\nICU Council being in favour of this. She then pre se nI.C. Improves\nThe proposed improvements to the Union building are at\nlast becoming visible.\nMost of the chairs on the first floor of the Union building\nhave recently been renovated at a cost to the Union of\nabout \u00a3300. Over the Summer, the upright chairs in the\nlower lounge will be replaced with a lesser amount of more\ncomfortable furniture; the old chairs being used in the\nformer upper refectory. It is hoped to install a Juke Box\nand more gentle lighting in the lower lounge, and plans for\na student re-decoration of the Upper Refec to make it more\nsuitable for disco's and parties, which fell through at Christmas, may be revived. However, the future of private parties\nin the Union must be in some doubt, after .the many complaints about late-night noise, and mess left by the selfish\nrevellers.\nIn ad did tion, the old snack bar by the Beit arch is being\nconverted into a new Union meeting room, to seat about\n60, which will be used as a Biology lounge during the day.\nThe only fear here is that the provision of reasonably i priced coffee in opposition to the lower re fec may give Vic Mooney\nyet another nail to smash into the Union building coffin.\nAfter several incidents last term involving friction between\nwatchers of the Union COLOUR television and organisers\nof functions in the Ante-Room next door, a floor bracket\nfor the box's anti-theft frame has now been fixed in the\nlower lounge, so that it will now be possible to install the\nset downstairs when necessary.\nMeanwhile in Southside, the T.V. is being left in .the Upper\nLounge for a trial period. Opinion at present is about 50-50\nin favour of a permanent move. The change has caused a noticeable increase of the use of Southside lounges as a whole, and has helped ease the crush in the bar.\nDownstairs, the new carpet was laid over Easter, at a total cost to the students of \u00a3950. Although the new carpet\ndoes not bear the Carl Cecil Seal of Approval, it is over\n\u00a3500 cheaper and probably more durable than its pre dec es sor, and ICU officials are delighted with the long-awaited\nimprovement to Southside. The method of fixing has also\nbeen improved, and rubber mats have been installed at the\nareas of heaviest wear.\nOn Monday, April 26th, a new coi mm on room was\nOpened on Level 4 in the Physics building. It occupies an\narea of about 1000 sq. ft. between the 1st and 2nd year\nlabs, the lifts and the stairs. If you had seen it last term\nbefore any improvements had been made, you would have\nthought, like most other people, that no-one could do\nanything to change the corridor-like atmosphere into, anything like acorn mo in room. However a remarkable transformation has taken place as anyone who has seen it knows.\nOne wall has been completely covered by a mural designed\nby Paul Clarke (Physics 1). The design is based on three\nted the NUS report and\nsome discussion took place\non how the Union floor\ncould be informed of motions coming up for the next\nconference so delegates\ncould express Union views.\nThe \"Pete Lambert\nAffair\" was discussed ad\nna use um. Pete was dismissed\nfrom college shortly before\nthe end of last term for not\nhaving completed his course-work. An appeal upheld the\nDepartment's decision that\nPete should be \"requested to\nwithdraw from college\" and\nbe allowed to return in October 1972 on completion of\na year in a technologically\nbased industry. A lot of discussion took place on whether the decision was fair, both\nas a general principle and in\nthis particular case.\nPete admitted to the meeting that he had done little\ncoursework and attended\nvery few lectures. There\nhave previously been cases\nof dismissals at this time of\nyear but they have in general been uncontested or for\nmedical reasons.\nThe Y. S.S.S. then proceeded to spout irrelevantly\nto the great amusement of\nthe meeting for about five\nminutes. Pete read the letter\nhe had received and the relevant regulation from the\nprospectus. He also informed\nthe meeting that he had been\ntold verbally that his dismissal was due in part to1 his\n\"bad influence.\" (Editorial\ncomment\u2014how can he be a bad influence when nobody\ntakes any notice of him any-way?) Geoff Needham then\nbrought the meeting to some\nkind of sensible discuss sion by reading a list of procedures he thought the college\nshould follow when they\nwere thinking of dismissing\nsomebody. The meeting\nagreed almost unanimously\nwith these sensible proposals\nand Geoff said he would refer them to Council. Piers\nthen proposed that Pete\nshould be reinstated in 1971\nand a vote was taken. The\nmajority abstained but more\nvoted for his reinstatement\nthan against it.\nThe Ricardo affair was\nthen raised and the Felix\neditor left to avoid dying of\nboredom.\nvoice prints of the word \"you\". Although not finished by the\nbeginning of the term, it should be completed now. The wall\nopposite the lifts has been covered by a large poster, originally advertising a well-known brand of whisky. You can now\ntake a Physicist anywhere!\nFor the first two weeks there were only ten chairs up\nthere. This was only a temporary arrangement, but it produced at least one comment that there was more room to\nsit down on Level 8! More than thirty new chairs arrived\non Friday, May 7it h. The coffee machine is situated in a small room (formerly\na cleaners cupboard) off the corridor. Coffee costs 2pa cup. The machine uses real ground coffee (not instant). It\nmakes ten, cups at a time and in the event that there is none\nleft when you go there, there are simple instructions on how\nto make coffee in about 8 minutes. Biscuits are also available\nat 2pa packet.\nThe coffee service is run by a student committee who\nwere also responsible for getting the common room ready\nduring the Easter vacation.\nOdds, Sods, Balls, and Cooke\nProspective climbers of the Queen's Tower may find it\nrather harder than previously (see PJ.C2), following an\nincident before Easter when the front door was left blowing\nin the wind, resulting in damage to the mahogany woodwork.\nThe climbers had entered by a40ft. climb up a vertical shaft\nleaving their nylon rope hanging down behind them. A grill\nat the top of the shaft has now been securely bolted down,\nand moreover a large padlock has been placed on an\nunavoidable door half way up the tower, thus ensuring\nthat naughty boys can't. possibly give the Queen's bells a tinkle. Will the next issue of P.I.C. tell us how to ring the\nbells in Mech Eng?\nWondered why there haven't been any more issues of\nPrivate I.C. Perhaps it's because Editor S. Cooke has at\nlast realised that nobody appreciates him. Not only are most\nof his contributors pissed off with his so-called magazine,\nbut he made a loss on the last issue after about 300 copies\nwere stolen and distributed about Southside gent's. Poor\nStevie!\nHis D.J.' d birthday party at Daddy's Guildford Palace\nwasn't too much of a hilt either, due to the presence of some\nof his supposed prestige College friends, notably a drunken\nD.T. Poor Stevie!\nNor has his year's reign over R.S.C. U. got him much\npraise. His only major achievement can hardly please his\nsuccessors\u2014viz. to manage, by gross over-spending, to pass\non a vast deficit. Poor Stevie!\nBritish Universities' first million volt electron microscope\nhas been installed in I.C.'s Microscope Laboratory in the\ndepartment of Metallurgy. The microscope was commissioned at a ceremony attended by, among others, Lord\nPenney and Prof. Sir Brian Flowers, F.R.S., Chairman of\nthe Science Research Council.\nThe microscope, an EM7 manufactured by AEI Scientific\nApparatus Ltd., part of .the (iEC-Elliott Automation Group,\nis the first of four that the SRC is providing for universities\nto improve our understanding of the micro structure of fluids\nand the influence of structure on bulk properties of materials.\nThe other three of these giant 22 ton, 18 feet high microscopes are to be installed at the Metallurgy Dept. of Oxford\nin May, Birmingham in August and at the BSC's Laboratories at Rotherham by July, the third being shared by\nLeeds, Manchester and Sheffield. I.C.'s microscope is for\nuse by the College and by academic in sti tuition s in the southeast region.\nBuilding of the Microscope Laboratory began in May\n1969 and the EM7, capable of resolving down to 5 Angstrom\nunits, came into operation in February this year. Special\nhandling facilities allow such operations as .tilting, heating,\ncooling and straining of the specimen to be carried out\nfrom the operating position. A unique feature of the control\nsystem is that the specimen to be viewed is moved by a single \"joystick\" control, allowing movement in any direction with a wide range of speeds and motion.\nThe advantage of .the new electron microscope is that\nit can handle specimens up to 5 times 'thicker than those\nused in conventional 100KV microscopes, normally ten\nthousandths of an inch thick. Because of their larger sizes,\nthe specimens have properties more like those of bulk\nmaterial, thus enabling many types of in situ experiments,\ne.g. stressing, to become a practical possibility.\nThe instrument uses all the latest integrated circuits and\nspecially designed servo mechanisms. To reduce the size\nof the power supplies required to drive the electromagnetic\nlens, a specially designed 400 Hz generator is included with\nthe equipment.\nAEI Scientific Apparatus Ltd. has been awarded the\nQueen's Award to Industry in respect of their EM7 electron\nmicroscope.\nThe Annual General Meeting of the Royal College of\nScience Union will be held today in Chemistry lecture\ntheatre A at 1.00 p.m. During the meeting there will be\nelections! for the assistant Hon Sec, the Publicity Officer\nand ten members of the entertainments committee.

    "content": "2 FELIX May 13th,1971 NUDE THEATRE AT LC?\nD.L gets the DJ/s Prince's Gardens was last week the scene of a strange orgy\nwith naked students careering through the flower beds and\nin and out the boiler house nearby. At least one couple were\nseen copulating in the great urn in the centre of the gardens,\nforming an attractive centre piece to the display. . . .\nAt the heart of things was a large rotund person, bearing\na slight resemblance to Clement Freud. His hands and arms\nmoved rhythmically and his nubile followers followed his\nevery motion, their graceful forms fleeting through the night\nair in stark contrast to the hard angular background of the\nImperial College Halls of Residence.\nI moved closer and looked harder at this n oct ural extra va ganza, crouching down so I could not be seen. Was this some\nmysterious occult society holding a secret meeting in the\nearly hours? Had I unwittingly stumbled on some religious\nsect bent on worshipping the demon Gods? My whirling\nmind was quickly brought down to earth by a sharp cry immediately to my right. 1 looked down and fought for breath\nas a human hand wrenched free from under my trembling\nfeet! This was attached to a long, slender arm, naked to the\nshoulder and just visible through the dew-covered green foliage . . . I stared, petrified and unable to move. A. human\narm!\nThis disappeared, then reappeared just as suddenly, and\nas my eyes adjusted to the background, I could dimly make\nout patches of the more obtrusive anatomy of a woman.\nNormally I would have been delighted at such a sight. . .\nmy loins instinctively tightened at the sight of a bare breast\ncheekily pushing out through the hedge\u2014but this momentary\nanimalism in me was swiftly overcome by amazement as I spied two more, riper and fuller than the first and just to one\nside. Two of them!\nMy attention was quickly diverted by what was happening\nin the garden. The commander had now moved to the great\nurn in the centre. I shivered both at the sight of this fleshy\nbeing and at the cold night air creeping through my thick\novercoat. Yet these people were naked as the day they were\nborn, and looked perfectly comfortable.\nI watched . . . the two forms across which I had previously\nstumbled ran past me into the naked throng which had now\ngathered round the urn. A deep murmuring of happy voices\nwas abruptly stopped at a sign from the commander. He gesticulated and made the most suggestive movements with his\nhands, while the score or so naked forms constantly brushed\nagainst each other in a tight cluster.\nI couldn't make out what he said but suddenly a startling\nthought flashed through my mind. I don't know how or why\nI thought as I did. I don't know who or what was responsible. Maybe it was a fleeting response to this scene which\ntook root in me and grew. Maybe it was an extension of the\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL by William Edmondson On Trinity Sunday, May 1961, Amnesty was born. Eric\nBaker (now chairman of the British Section), and Peter Benenson, in an article in the Observer, suggested that people\nshould write to various governments about \"forgotten prisoners\". The response was so great that an organisation was\nformed. International interest grew and it was decided to\nmake the organisation international, the product:\u2014Amnesty\nInternational, a non-political body of people concerned about\nHuman Rights.\nA. I. is particularly concerned about \"prisoners of cons-cie nce\".A prisoner of conscience is a sort of political pri so ner; such a prisoner must not have committed any violence,\nhe is imprisoned or 'restricted' by his government, often without charge or trial, because of his beliefs, religious or poli-t ical. Very often such prisoners are tortured, sexually abused,\nisolated from other prisoners and from the outside world,\ntheir treatment being far worse than ordinary criminals.\nA. I. has its headquarters, the International Secretariat, in\nLondon, and various national headquarters in other co un tries. World-wide membership is about 17,000, British membership is about 2000 many of whom are members of a group.\nA group is a collection of people who undertake to adopt\nor investigate a prisoner (this latter category is necessary to\nthoughts of the people there in Prince's Gardens, that cold\nMay morning. All I know is that I felt a strong desire to join\nthem. I almost unthinkingly stripped off, put my clothes in\na neat pile under the hedge and ran across to join the group.\nNobody said a word to me (just as I thought) and within\nseconds I was completely absorbed in the crowd. I was now\npart of them, and didn't feel in the least bit ridiculous or out\nof place. I was secure and I belonged. Why was this when\nonly a few minutes ago I'd looked on in amazement at these\nstrange people of whom I was now a part. And it suddenly\nstruck me that I had wanted to join them for a long time. It\nwas now no longer an absurd thing to do. Others were there\ndoing exactly the same thing and I would have joined them\nhad I discovered them a few days before, or a few years\nhence, or tomorrow, or the next day.\nSo if this was what I'd wanted to do, I must have previously been afraid to do it. I felt ashamed at this new found\nfailing in my character. I looked around at the black, stark\nbuildings and realised the people in there were still asleep;\nAsleep in its true meaning. They were completely ignorant\nof the fact that people were running naked round Princes\nGardens every night. Of course none of them would believe\nit if they were told.\nIt's a ridiculous thing to do.\nestablish that a prisoner is a prisoner of conscience). There\nare some 2000 prisoners in 60 countries who are A. I. cases at\npresent, either adopted or under investigation. Groups help\nprisoners by writing to governments, the prisoners them-selves, their families and anyone else who needs to be con-t acted. Groups also raise money, and this is often more rewarding than writing letters most of which are never\nanswered. The money is used in two ways. Firstly, each\ngroup sends money to their national section (who then pay\nthe International Section) for research into cases. The International Section does all the research on the cases the groups\ntake up. Secondly, groups give direct help to prisoners' fam i lies, paying for schooling, clothes, food, etc. Apart from\nmoney raising activities a group will meet perhaps monthly\nto discuss progress and the work of the individuals concerned with prisoners.\nGroups also help support (financially) missions. A mission\nis a visit, often by a lawyer, to a country which is holding a trial. The presence of a foreign lawyer at a trial is helpful,\nand contacts with sympathetic lawyers can be made. The\nmission may be to contact governments, observe prison con-ditions, etc.\nThe Hampstead group, of which I am a member, has 5\nprisoners; in Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Rhodesia, and Greece.\nWe need Money (like all groups), donations to A. I. Turnagain Lane, Farringdon St. E.C.4.( from whom you can also\nget details of membership) or to W. Edmondson, Rm.1108.\nElec.Eng.\nWhy not become a member, or start a group in the col-leg e? Languages are very useful and if you feel you might be\ncompromised you can use a pseudonym. Please contact me\nif you would hk e to know more.\nN.U.S. LANCASTER '71\nMeaningful or Masturbatory ?\nBy John McCollough\nJust four weeks ago, five I.C. delegates left a cool, blustery\nLancaster University, quietly musing on the importance, the\nmeaning, the emotions, and the debates of the Annual Easter\nN.U.S. conference that had just terminated.\nFor the average student back home in their union, perhaps most of the decisions made at this conference will have\nlittle effect or interest. Generally the conference was quite\norderly, although emotions did run quite high on the last\nevening when the left (not to be confused with our conservative Soc Soc) managed to bully the conference into discussing the Industrial Relations Bill instead of the more\nhighly urgent Regions and Areas (do we prefer U.L. U. or\nU.S.K.?) motion.\nMost of the time the conference seemed politically united\nwith strong anti-Tory feeling, this probably being reflected\nin the election of Digby Jacks, the Communist, as President\u2014\nin fact he seemed politically radical in name only (just to get\nthe left-wing votes) taking a line generally close to that of\nJack Straw, the Socialist, who has perhaps been one of the\nbest N.U.S. Presidents for quite a while. Thus the main distinction at the conference was between the moderate anti-Tories, trying to get better housing mandates and debates\non careers, grants, etc., and the demagogues trying to force\nthrough and prolong debates on General Strikes, the Industrial Relations Bill etc. When the lefties did get their Thursday night victory there was brief talk of d is a fli Hati on by\nsome but most their political masturbation could be stopped\nby showing our own unions what was important that hap-pen ed, that it maybe will affect them and thus hoping that\nthey won't elect too many political masturbation is ts to the\nnext conference.\nSO WHAT WAS MEANINGFUL?\nPefhaps one of the things that came out of the conference\nthat will be most likely to affect some of you, was the I.C. proposed decision to mount an accommodation campaign\nat the beginning of next term. A long, constructive, very\norderly debate and an accompanying press conference snowed\nthat everybody knows there is a great student accommodation problem, but that few knew how bad it is. Our greatest\nworry is that e. g.I.C., Chelsea, Q.E. C. etc. will keep expand-ing, thus pouring an ever increasing number of students into\nS.W. London, looking for what is at present a stationary, if\nnot declining amount, of accommodation. This problem is\nat its obvious worst during the first term and it is hoped\nthat a concentrated campaign (and many students feel this\nis more relevant to them than a grants campaign) will attract\npublic sympathy to the student cause, get colleges to reconsider their expansion plans and hopefully get more government finance in certain areas.\nThe grants debate was generally low key, most delegates\nbeing disappointed that the Government's new grants offer\nhadn't yet been announced, however it was decided that a Grants campaign would soon have to become a yearly fe a ture, it was thought here that this could be very much coordinated with other campaigns.\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nAnother major debate was on N.U.S. Subscriptions. It was\ndecided that these should be proportional to the Union fee\nthat each college receives. (We get \u00a36 per head per year).\nThus smaller, poorer colleges would benefit. It was also felt\nthat an increase was needed to cover the increased cost of\ncampaigns, inflation, assistance to constituent organisations,\netc. With the new Union fee (\u00a310 in 72/73 we hope) it will\nmean that our fee will nearly double by 1977, but proportionally, it will be very much the same (about 4\u00a3 per cent\nof our Union fee money).\nMany more topics deserve mentioning, exams., Student\nUnion autonomy, careers, the Binary System, the N.U.S. merger with the Scottish Union of Students, etc. GET A COPY OF THE N.U.S. REPORT (available soon from the\nUnion Office.) or go and see one of the delegates.\nIs it all relevant? Let's see how bad the accommodation\nsituation is next October. Maybe then we won't be able to\nhelp finding ourselves in the forefront of the campaign.\nSTAYING IN LONDON OVER SUMMER?

LU. athletics\nThe University of London Atihleitic Championships were\nheld at Motspur Park on Friday, April 30th and Saturday,\nMay 1st. They were dominated, as expected, by Guy's Hospital and Royal Hoilloway College who fielded strong\nteams and finished first and second respectively. I.C., how-ever, finished a respectable third and easily defeated rivals\nU.C., Q.M. C. and L.S.E. There were some excellent individual performances by\nI.C. athletes, Two of these both came from Graham Hunt,\nthis year's captain of U. L.A.C. He won the 400m. hurdles\nin a time of 57.0 seconds and later, in (the most exciting\nfinish of the championships, also won 'the 400m. in 50.8\nseconds. Another outstanding performance was that of Barry\nDabrowski who won the 3000m. walk, almost lapping the\nrunner-up (who looked suspiciously to be running). In the\nwomen's events, I.C. could have done with a few more\nlike Christine Culshaw, our only I. C.W. A. representative.\nChristine won the 100m. and the 800m. and was given\nsecond place in a dead-heat finish to the 200m. She thus\namassed, single-handed, a points total which gave I.C. women's 'team' second place behind Royal Holloway College.\nOthers who were placed in their events were: Bob Howard (2nd in Pole Vault), Martin Suggett (2nd in Discus),\nGarry Hill (4th in High Jump), Barry Dabrowski (4th in\n3000m. Steeplechase), George Widelski (4th in Shot), Richard May (5th in 100m.) Steve Fletcher.\nEasier rugby\nUnfortunately, due to financial difficulties the R.F.C. did\nnot tour during the Easter vac.\u2014however, we look forward\nvery much to going abroad next year! (Hint, ACC).\nThe club did however take part in the qualifying rounds\nof 'the Middlesex Sevens competition held on 'the Saturday\nbefore term started. We came to an early end however due\nto the rather weakened seven which finally took the field\n(people get married at such awkward times!) and also due\nto the fact that Richmond I happened to be our opponents\nin the 1st round! Although the score was 3 pts. all for at\nleast 4 mins., we finally succumbed 18 pts. to 3 pits, to Bucknail and Company.\nThe old boys side of I.C. rugby, namely Ffagins, visited\nLowestoft rugby festival in Bast Anglia. They fared very\nwell winning most of their games and certainly excelling in\nthe social side of the proceedings. This marked the end of\nan extremely successful season for Ffagins who have been\nsuccessfully resurrected by Barrie Mair. Anyone leaving\ncollege rugby but staying in London would be well advised\nto contact Barrie as they can only go from strength to\nstrength.\nSevens team: Clive Swinnenton, Ifor Rhys, Robin Fourness,\nMartin Harrison, Derrick Marriott, Mike Adams (capt.)\nand Keith Devaney.\nM. Adams.\nBoat Club Paris trip\nI. CB.C.'s third VIII boarded the college Transit and left\nthe boat house at Putney early on the morning of Thursday,\nApril 22. Bound for Ramsgate and thence to Paris; we were\nto row in the Coup Gelis a regatta similar to U.L.' s Allom\nCup run on an invitation basis. We arrived back on the\nfollowing Sunday by BEA Trident III from le Bourget.\nThe events in between these times will long be remembered\nby all who went.\nOnce we had cleared London (a task more difficult than\nwe had first imagined) we had a smooth journey to Paris,\nand then by means of some miraculous driving and somewhat\ndoubtful navigation through the Paris rush-hour, arrived\nat the rendezvous and met our hosts, the Ecole Superiere de\nCommerce de Paris (ESCP).\nA brief venture into the Latin quarter for a meal, quickly\nmade us realise the monetary value of English food, and\nrather exhausted, we made our way to the youth hostel at\nChoissy-le-roi, the venue of the Coup Gelis. A practice\nouting the following morning on the 1500m. course proved\nbeneficial if somewhat wet. We s plo shed back through the\ntown in rowing kit, to the amusement of the inhabitants and\nthe annoyance of the hos tellers. Once again dry, we set\noff on the long walk round Paris, returning for our customary early night very footsore.\nThe racing took place on the Saturday; we finished 9th out of 46 VIIIs in the morning time trial over 1000m., and\nqualified for the afternoon's petite finale (the first five VIIIs\nrace in the grande finale). Before the afternoon's race we\nwere the guests of ESCP for a sumptuous lunch including\nmu ah wine. We reluctantly took to the water in the after-noon. We had a slow start against three French crews but\nby 1000m. of the 1500m. race we were level with the leaders\nand were going through strongly. Unfortunately the boat,\nbeing patriotically French of German origin, preferred the\nother crews. Bill Graham painfully found himself without\na seat and we finished fourth with only 7 men working. Our\ninitial disappointment soon faded at the champagne reception\nfollowed by a dinner with some of the oarsmen and oars-women of ESCP.\nWe rose, bleary eyed, early the next morning and set off\nfor home. Half an hour found us at a garage just north of\nParis with a burnt-out clutch. The A A advised us to abandon\nthe wagon to them and return by air from le Bourget, which\nwas a couple of miles away. Thus we returned to England.\nThe trip will be remembered for its high spots (finding\nourselves sharing showers with the women in the hostel), the\nvociferous old French tramp who joined with our singing,\nand its calamities, the broken seat, the broken clutch and\nthe broken bank balance.\nOur thanks to ESCP for Saturday morning, Saturday\nlunch (hie), Saturday afternoon, Saturday tea time (hie),\nand Saturday night (hie; burp) especially Dominique (whose\nmaternal, admiring eye never strayed from Charlie, who\nalso deserves our thanks) and Miriam (who was just nice\nto everybody).\nS.O. Mebody.\nBadminton successes\nAlong with the Badminton Club's success in the U.L. U. League, as indicated by the table below,\nPosn. W LF A MENS I11007218 MENS II 2 7 3 59 41\nMENS III 2 7 3 58 42\nMENS IV 3 5 5 44 56\nMIXED 1 10 0 80 10\nLADIES 5 4 4 34 38\nI.C. were very well represented at 'the recent U.L. U. cham-pion ships. In fact the only final in which I.C. had no representative was the Men's Singles.\nLynne Beynon won the Ladies Singles, and along with\nSue Thompson, justified their top seed position by taking\nthe Ladies Etoubles.\nStuart Donald and partner from R.H. C. went through\nto win the mixed doubles with relative ease.\nSteve Saw and Souki Theuvwara were unfortunately on\nopposing sides in the Men's Doubles final; had they played\ntogether, we may well have taken another event.\nUndoubtedly an extremely successful season for I.C. The\nLadies team's position in the League should have been\nhigher without a doubt. This was clearly shown by I.C.'s63 win over Chelsea (3rd in League) with only four ladies\nplaying for I.C.A note of thanks to all players concerned for giving I.C. such a splendid success.\nA special note of thanks to the committee, Dave Gilmore\n(Vice-Capt.), John Powell (Sec.), and Steve Sanderson\n(Treasurer) for making the club run smoothly. Also to Sue\nThonipson who has not missed a mixed match in the past\ntwo seasons, even though she has played regularly for U.L. U. and has had the added responsibility of captaining the Ladies\nHockey Team this year.\nA.N. Onymous.\nVolleyball triumph\nDuring the Easter vacation the Volleyball club went on\ntour in The Hague, Holland. We travelled over by boat on\nEaster Monday and played our first match as a 'training\nsession against a visiting German team, who we beat two\nsets to one. They were there to play in the same tournament\nas us, which was arranged for the Wednesday. This was\nplayed in a superb sports hall 29 x48 metres, which made\nBritish facilities look minute. In our pool we started by\nbeating the team from Belgium but lost to a team from\nRotterdam. We then had to play the winners of the other\npool, the French team from Lille, which resulted in a20 win for them. During the lunch break the Germans, who\nwe had made friends with the previous evening played off\nfor and won fifth place and then returned to cheer us in the\nplay-off for third place against the home team. The first set\nstarted badly\u2014we were 13-2 down at one stage, but drew\nlevel before they could reach 15 with a2 point lead and we\nfinally won 19-17. We lost the next set quickly, but rallied\nto take the last set and third place. The following night we\nplayed one of the local league teams and beat them 3 sets\nto 1.\nAt home we have won the South-East Technical Colleges\nleague and reached the finals of the cup competition, to be\nplayed Wednesday the 19th of May at Crystal Palace. In the\nNational League Div. 2 (South) we have won 3 and lost 7,\nbut can hope for better results in our remaining games. At\nthe start of this term we represented SEETECH in the Focus\nChampionships, the national areas tournament, at Crystal\nPalace and won.\nAs can be seen from our results, this has been our most\nsuccessful season to-date.\nC. Orton.\nI.C. Hockey on the road\nThe festival XIII arrived at Weymouth from all parts of\nthe country by devious routes. Mr. Bates seems to remember\nbeing instructed by his navigator that the correct way to\nproceed was to cross the central reservation of A31 and to\nhead off into darkest Hampshire\u2014which was sharply exec u ted. Using this optimum method, he succeeded in taking\nsix hours from London (only 130 miles). Most of the team\narrived by about 10.00 p.m. whereupon the liveliest haunts\nwere found, and duly used for the quenching of thirst.\nThe turn-out for the photograph at 9.30 a.m. on Good\nFriday was complete, although a little lacking in spirit. To\nadd to the general feeling of doom, it was wet, windy and\ncold. But as al good teams should, we overcame the conditions and thrashed the Meeces by 2 goals to nil (scorers\nD. Richman and I. Tasney). After the game, our centre-forward felt a little tired and proceeded to sleep for seven\nhours! The afternoon saw us lose narrowly to Bedford by 1-0.\nThat night we bumped into Southampton University (better\nknown as Wessex W. Anchors) and drunk them under the\ntable. The games on Saturday were played at an incredible\npace and although I.C. Should have won both of them, we\nlost to the Poachers, but defeated the Bards (Stratford-upon-Avon) by 2-0\u2014Dave Wilson scoring his 25th goal of the\nseason with a penalty flick.\nSunday was supposed to be 'rest-day', but besides playing\nfootball on the be a oh, the team took a sightseeing trip along\nChesil Beaoh and sampled a few Pubs. At Lulworth Cove,\nSimon Tyrell insisted that the sea was too cold for swimming\ndespite concerted efforts!\nEaster Monday was yet another fantastic day (with regards to the weather), and saw I.C. draw both their games,\n0-0 against Basingstoke, and 1-1 against Fareham. In this\nlast game, the captain scored from a short corner to boost\nhis tally to eight!\nThe final night was spent finishing the odd whisky and\ngin battles before sampling the local fare and subsequently\ndepositing Mr. Tyrell in the English Channel at 3.30 a.m. Record of Festival: P6,W2, L2,D2, F5,A3.

Here, it's a tangled skyway carrying you over the snows;there, it's a five-mile gallery through ponderous rock. At Kandersteg, on one\nof the approaches to Zermatt, a train pulls you, In your car,\nbackwards through twenty kilometres of black tunnel.\nTo reach Zermat, you\nmust commit yourself\u2014not\nthe sort of place you can\ntake in on your Sunday\ndrive. For the road officially\nends thirty kilometres from\nthe village; thereafter, only\nthe train reliably winds up\nthe mountain wall.\nFrom the train, scraping\naround a tight bend, you first\nglimpse the Matterhorn,\nwhich will dominate your\nvisit. The Matterhorn seems\nto lean out over Zermat, as if\nto drop its icy cloak on the\nscattered chalets two miles\nbelow.\nZermat has the abandon\nof a cloistered retreat. Because all have made a special\npilgrimage to this place, a new sense of community\narises. The chalets, ski-hills,\nand cafes bring people to-get her, regardless of linguistic distances. In a few days\nyou will begin to recognise\nmost of the villagers, to be\nrecognised. Zermat lies in the\nWalliser valley, an enclave of\nGerman Schweizers among\nthe French Suisses. They delight in large but elegantly\nprepared meals, a varied cuisine high hg h ted by local\nspecialities \u2014 dried meats,\ntrout, special cheese and\nbreads.\nOddly, the outward aspect\nof life does not seem to alter\ngreatly if you cross, east-wards, into the Italian Tyrol.\nSuperficial detail is radically\ndifferent: mountain cool is\ntransformed by relaxing\nZephyrs, Swiss calm is tempered by Latin fury, the\narchitecture begins to suggest Mediterranean sun, cabbage salad gives place to\npasta. Yet, beyond this, the\nlife style is similar to that on\nother slopes of the Alps:\neveryone, local or foreign,\nhas a place in the community, this society is frank and\noutgoing; and, again, the\nfocal point of each day is a grand meal.\nWith a bit of courage and\na few phrases, the diner\nquickly dispels the myth that\nItalian food is a lot of noodle\ndrowned in tomato sauce.\nMenus tend to be extremely\nlarge and diverse. Simple\ntypes of pasta are prepared\nwith ingenuity and care\u2014\nand these are only a pet is ers, to be followed by fresh trout\nmeunier e,a mountain version of the esc a lope, or other\nentree s peculiar to the area.\nFinally, light desserts, a wide\nrange of excellent cheeses,\nand incomparable coffee.\nThroughout the meal, the\ntable swims in light but flav-our able wine from the local\ncellars.\nCost? The cuisine throughout Italy, Switzerland and\nFrance is of such quality that\n'cost' is an unimportant fac-tor.\nTo those who know Venice, Florence, Rome, the\n'museums without walls' to\nthe south, the foothills of the\nnorth are an exciting sur-p rise. Between the last fingers of the Alps lie Como,\nGarda and Maggiore, crystal\nlakes whose shores are much\nmore impressive than the\nItalian Riviera: villas in the\nrefined Italian style flanked\nby those spire-like pines,\nsheer blue rock plunging into\nthe water.\nNestled in the valley above\nLake Garda, Trento, is a place to linger. The town's centre is very small and very\nold. Shops and restaurants\nlurk in the arcades and dim\nalleys. Look upward, on a sunny morning, and you will\nsee, high over the time-stained rafters and terra cotta\nrooftops, the lustrous Alpine\nsnow caps. Apart from geographical\nvoyeurism, what is the point\nin travel? Doesn't the traveller deceive himself to think\nthat the communal spirit of\na ski resort or the conviviality of villagers reflects a better way of life, some standard\nto be pursued? Yes, probably\nso, but to evade everyday\npressures, to find communities seemingly oblivious to\nyour own son of hang-ups is\nsurely the best sense of 'to\nholiday'.\nA KIBBUTZ . . . .\nWhat's it all about?

Chelmsford (0245) 65461\nPARIS\nBy Ted Hayes When I was first asked to write an article about the few\ndays I spent in Paris over the Easter vacation, I must confess\nthat I was little apprehensive. This was my third trip to Paris\nand I had already seen most of the tourist attractions which\nare automatically associated with it. Such things as the Eiffel\ntower, the Champs Elysees, 1'Arc de Triomphe, Notrre Dame,\nSacre Coeur, and the Louvre I had seen more than a year ago.\nI had even had a sample of the Parisian night-life when, in a moment of extravagance, I went to see the Folies Bergere.\nSo when I found myself arriving at the Gare due Nord a few\nweeks ago I was a bit doubtful about what I would be doing\nin the next few days and yet I was confident that there was\nstill much that I had overlooked on my previous trips.\nWith my experience from previous trips, I soon found a hotel room near the Gare du Nord, an area which is full of\nsmall and fairly inexpensive hotels. As soon as I was settled,\nthe first thing I did was to get a ticket for a performance of\n'La Traviata' which was taking place at the Opera-Comique.\nThe performance proved to be 'comique' in an unexpected\nway. Before the main performance began there were a few\nheated exchanges taking place in the balcony between the\nushers and some members of the audience. These arguments\nbegan when the ushers, who had just shown some tourists to\ntheir seats, stood with outstretched hand and muttered that all\ntoo familiar phrase in a voice devoid of any emotion\u2014\"Pour\nla service, monsieur\". As my fellow tourists soon found out, it\nwas senseless to argue. The main performance was tolerable\nif you were willing to ignore the sloppy production and the\nnoise of the metro which periodically rumbled by directly\nbeneath the theatre.\nIf your forte is not the opera, you can try absorbing some\nculture in one of the many museums. As a first choice one\ncannot do better than the Louvre because, as an acquaintance\nof mine so succ in t ly phrased it, \"That's where the art is\". For\nthose who would rather have their culture in smaller doses,\nthey can visit some of the more specialised collections such as\nthose at the Rodin Museum or the Jeu de Paume. The Rodin\nMuseum, as the name implies, contains a superb collection of\nthe works of Rodin who is probably the greatest sculptor\nsince Michelangelo. The Jeu de Paume contains a large coli-lect ion of impressionist paint a in gs with such artists as Degas,\nVan Gogh, Manet, Monet, and Renoir being well represented.\nOnce you have had enough culture, you can go for a stroll\nin one of the gardens, such as the Jardin des Tuilerie or the\nJardin de Luxembourg, or, better still, along some of the\nsmall charming streets in the Quartier Latin or Montmartre.\nWhile in Montmartre it is well worth while to stop for a cup\nof coffee in the Place de Tertre and watch the Parisian artists\nat work.\nFinally, if time permits, you can take a day off and visit\nthe Palace at Versailles. If you go on an organised coach\ntour it will cost twenty or thirty francs; if you go by public\ntransport you can do it for about five francs.\nThe palace at Versailles is quite splendid, but usually very\ncrowded; the gardens are beautiful and immense so you can\neasily get away from the bulk of the tourists if you so wish.\nWhen it comes time to leave Paris and return to London,\nyou will have to make your way back to the Gare du Nord,\nthat is, if you are travelling by rail. The night train leaves at\n10 o 'clock and arrives in London some time around 9 o 'clock\nthe following morning. When you finally arrive you will\nprobably have spent most of your money and all of your\nenergy, but, in place of these you will have the memories of a few days spent in, what I believe to be, one of the most beautiful cities in the world; such an exchange seems eminently\nfair.\nHOSTS\nACTS\nFAST!

    "content": "May 13th,1971 FELIX\nTHE CARNIVAL ORGANISATION A Living Legend by Dennis Taylor It must have been increasingly obvious to anyone with insight that the most stable influence on the British economy\nthis year has been the existence of Carnival. Number one in a field of one, this admirable organisation has been a mild\nsuccess this year compared with the usual total failure.\nWhile Rolls-Royce crashed and many of the \"stable\" companies and their shares travelled a weary downhill path,\nCarnival alone remained prosperous and enterprising making\nground where others couldn't, and closing to date with a sum\nof about \u00a34,000.\nThe role of Carnival in\nBritish Government is apparent from Edward Heath,\nphilosopher and politician in\nhis victory speech only a short while ago: \". . . and we,\nthe Tory Party pledge to\nkeep all our election promises and with the help of Carnival hope to provide a better standard of living to\n/ou who most certainly des-:r ve it\".\nThe words of a great man\nfor a great organisation.\nHow does Carnival prosper\nwhere other fall? Carnival\nis continuously engaged in\nlooking at new projects and\nperfecting the many pieces of\nspecialised equipment needed in profiteering and racket-ee ring. An example of this is\nthe present research into\nstrippers and associated\nphenomena in the field of\nvisual excitement (see photo-graph). We believe it is not\nenough to be content with\njust taking money from pe o ple, but to make them think\nwe deserve it. Fostering such\nan attitude requires many advanced techniques and we at\nCarnival devote a large proportion of our time to re-search.\nInternational Relations\nA great deal of effort is\nalso expended in promoting\ninternational collaboration\nboth in research/development\nand of course production.\nCarnival has close links with\nLTnstitut Francais and\nMaria Assumpta organisations and plans are being\nlaid to encourage the more\napathetic backward colleges\nin the USK to participate in\nCarnival next year.\nProspects\nA young undergraduate\nconsidering taking up a first\nappointment with Carnival\nwill be interested in his future prospects and progress\nwithin the organisation. The\noverall objective of our policy is to ensure that individuals with potential are identified and given the opportunity to work in their chosen\nfield. The individual's own\nambitions and interests will\nbe taken Soto account so that\nhis capabilities are utilised\nto the full. We start with the\nidea that the best way to\nlearn is by doing and the\nknowledge gained through\nacademic studies is regarded\nas a good base on which to\nbuild.\nAppointments\nA run down of the more\nimportant posts is given be-low. These are the \"bare-bones\" of Carnival and the\nnumber of vacancies is proportional to the work avail-able. Of course it is possible\nto approach the company\ndirectly and make one's own\nwork. These people are at a premium and will be immediately absorbed into a high position. Whilst the particular skill is not of overriding importance the way of\nthinking is.\nCarnival\nCo-or d in at or Due to a recent change in\nthe constitution the Co-or d in at or will be democratically\nelected at a Union meeting\n(the one after May 6th). This\nis a pleasant job, theoretically administrative, and\nmainly involves \"delegation\nof responsibility\" or just\ntelling people what to do.\nQualifications: average in-tell i gence, sociability and absolutely no scruples. Applicants must have a thorough\ngrounding in oral mechanics\n\u2014the art of telling people\nwhat to do in such a way\nthat they think they're the\nonly people capable of doing\nit.\nSalary: under negotiation.\nTreasurer\nSimilar to co-or d in at or with a close involvement in\neverything. Must have a clean\nrecord and be able to handle\ndogs and a night-stick. Deals\nwith about \u00a35,000, all of\nwhich must be item is ed to\nconvince the auditors and\nourselves that we're not fiddling anything. He must also\nbe of a persuasive disposition\nand conveniently forgetful,\ndepending on which way the\nmoney's going.\nSecretary\nA tireless worker involved\nwith all paperwork, a polo g ies, summonses, begging letters and day-to-day correspondence. She/he must have\nthe ability to put in writing\nwhat everybody should have\nsaid.\nCarnival Ents\nThis position has not been\nfilled this year. Successful applicants should be able to\ntalk to agents, catering firms,\netc. and convince them that\nthey're helping themselves by\nhelping us at a reduced rate.\nA difficult job dealing with\nanything from a \u00a32,000\nAlbert Hall disaster to a Carnival Queen fiasco.\nMiscellaneous positions\ninclude interesting and varied work on internal (college)\npublicity, external and public\nrelations, rag-mag, raffle and\nstunts.\nSelection Procedure\nThe Co-or dr nat or is the\nonly member of the organisation elected by the college\nand aspiring volunteers in\nany field should approach\nhim directly after he's elected so that he can form a \"bare-bones\" committee before the end of term. Everybody considered on merit and\ncharacter.\nBenefits of Service\nTravel: past work has taken members as far afield as\nJohn O 'Groats, Lands End,\nNeasden, Dublin, Belfast,\nEdinburgh and Cardiff on\npaid expenses.\nHolidays: 15 weeks' paid\nholiday or two^ days in the\nsick bay depending on success. Pension and Life Insurance: taken out on all mem-be rs.*** Employees are thus given\nevery opportunity to develop\nthe skills they may (or may\nnot) have, and will find\nthemselves meeting many different people from all walks\nof life. The work is worthwhile and satisfying and\nranges in dealings from Rectors to Crimsoc, from drunks\nto film-stars and leads to\nqualifications recognised\nthroughout the country.\nJOIN CARNIVAL 1971-72 AND ENJOY LIFE.\nKeep 'em on, love, keep 'em on.\nObituary Carnival, having been with us for two long terms and a few\nweeks of .this one, finally passed away quietly on May 6th at\n11 p.m. in the Ante-Room. It died peacefully and with dignity\nin the company of a few good friends presenting the \"Schol-ars\" in concert as a farewell a ot. This unique vocal quintet were all choral scholars in the\nKings College, Cambridge Choir, and their repertoire covered some 500 years of English music. They delighted the\naudience with a tonal quality and excellence rarely heard: the\nacoustics of the Great Hall enhancing the performance.\nThe concert was sponsored by the Greater London Arts\nAssociation and supported by London Weekend Television,\nand provided a pleasant relief from the more usual entertainment provided in the Great Hall.\nWould all people who sold Rag Mags please return sales money and unsold magazine sassoon as possible. A Physicist's Problem The integrated monitored concept\nOf functional digital programming\nIs a responsive incremental contingency\nActing on the optional transitional flexibility\nOf the system.\nWith the total reciprocal projection of this problem,\nIt's responsive management options\nBear no relation\nTo our parallel third-generation hardware\nWith its balanced policy concept\nAnd its synchronized logistical time-phase.\nThus,\nDealing solely with\nThe system at is ed organisational mobility,\nWe have no\nCompatible\nMonitored\nContingency\nWhatsoever,\nAnd have therefore to yield\nTo the optional logistical mobility\nof the computer.\nAND THAT IS MY PROBLEM IN A NUTSHELL.\nDavid Dangoor\nWhat aboutus then? Imperiol College students, past and present, are in the news\nagain, with Peter Hain's chairmanship of the Young Liberals,\nand Gordon Reece's uncomplimentary mention in Private\nEye. The gist of P.E's. argument against Mr. Reece, who won\nThe New Statesman's Student journalism competition, was\nthat he's34, an engineer, a postgraduate, and brother-in-law\nof a regular contributor to The New Statesman. Mr. Reece\nvindicated himself handsomely in a clever little letter, published by P.E. in the next issue, and he's really 29. Not wishing to be too uncharitable (but nevertheless being so), we are\nreminded that the competition which caused the exchange was\nfor student journalists, and that as yet Mr. Reece has contributed a quantity of copy not un adjacent to zero to his own\nStudents' Union newspaper, your very own organ, the grossly\nunderstaffed and fantastically under praised FELIX.\n. . . and a final word from Mick,\nLeper, Kathy, and all the boys\nat the corpse factory\nThey found him hiding in a corner and dragged him out to\ntell him he had to do something about Kathy, who was diverting all the traffic in Exhibition Road. He didn't want to\nmove, but they pulled him out from under Southside and up\nto the roadway where the cars were slowed to a near halt.\nIt was high summer. Tempers frayed in the heat and the\nstudent bustle was crowned with car horns shrieking at frequent intervals.\nLeper sat on his haunches at the roadside, white teeth\nshowing in his usual grin, glancing occasionally at Kathy.\n\"Hey Mick,\" he called, when they hauled his friend out by\nthe Mormon church, \"looks like you've got a problem\". In\nthe heat, everything was noisier, everyone was dressed lightly,\nmoved lightly, commuting across Exhibition Road between\nbusiness and pleasure. The stream of cars moved suddenly as\na bottleneck cleared momentarily, then Slowed down to a crawl. Mick threaded his way between them, shaking off his\nescort who went their ways; he went over to Leper, stooped\nby him.\nHe looked at Kathy, and then around at all the people\nmoving to and fro, going about their business.\n\"Why the hell haven't some of them done something about\nher?\" he complained irritably. \"She's causing chaos there\".\nLeper looked up from where he crouched, shrugged. \"Per-hap s they haven't noticed. It's only Rathy getting in the way\nagain; nothing really to do with them\".\nMick shook his head wearily. \"Do I have to do every-thing?\"\nHe pulled Leper to his feet. \"Give me a hand then\", he\nsaid, and they moved in among the traffic. \"Where are we\ngoing to put her\", Leper asked when they reached the van.\nMick thought for a moment. \"Home, I suppose\".\nThe car had thrown her several feet across the road where\nshe had come to rest partly underneath the parked van, and\npartly blocking the northbound lane.

The explosion demolished two fume cupboards, full of toxic materials, damaged another fridge beyond repair, and singed the cyanide fume cupboard. The door of the exploding fridge was hurled60 ft across the lab. The explosion was caused by the presence of open beakers of petroleum ether whose vapour was ignited by the spark, from the thermostat of the fridge. The fire brigade arrived promptly and threw the still burning fridge out of the window. No one was injured. Apparently Brighton Tech had a similar experience recently and rang I.

    "content": "4 FELIX May 13th,1971 THE TRANSPORT PROBLEM is just\none of a number of important issues with\nwhich ordinary people are becoming more\nactively concerned. When the Greater\nLondon Council published its Development\nPlan in 1969, 20,000 objections to it were\nreceived, the majority specifically referring\nto one aspect or another of the transport\nproposals. What is the essence of the\nurban transport problem? Most of us have\na fairly clear picture of its worst manifestation\u2014crowded trains, interminable queues\nat bus stops, choking traffic jams, trying to\ncross Exhibition Road at lunch time\u2014but\nthe underlying causes of the problem are\nnot clear cut. Even in a series of lengthy\ndissertations it would be impossible to disentangle all the components of the problem\nand the il r inter-relationship with other\nurban issues. This brief essay no more than\ncomments on certain aspects of the pro b lem.\nTo start, it has been recognised that the\ntransport of goods and people is not an\nactivity in itself, but a function of land-utilising activities such as industry, commerce of shopping. People normally move\nabout in order to get to a pre-determined\ndestination, not just for the sake of travel-ling. Transport can justly be (regarded as\none of a number of services which people\nexpect to be able to obtain in various\nforms, in the same way as other services,\nsubject to the limitations imposed by technology and cost. Individuals also expect to\nbe able to obtain this service without great\nloss of some other amenities which sometimes conflict with the provision of trans-port; notably peace and quiet where they\nlive, and a pleasant and safe environment\nin which to work and enjoy their leisure.\nThe community, however, has to ensure\nthat transport does not command a disproportionate amount of the scarce resources\nwhich need to be shared with other competing demands such as housing and e duca tion, or the provision of much needed open\nspace.\nThe essential feature of urban transport\nis the imbalance that exists between demand and supply in many kinds of transport service, and in the environmental needs\nwhich seem to conflict with the transport\nneeds. The one factor which has had a major influence on both the demand for,\nand the supply of, transport is urban\ngrowth. Most countries in the world, developed, under-developed or never-to-be-developed, are still rapidly urban ising. As\ncities expand the demand for transport\ngrows more than proportionately because\nof the longer distances to travel. But the\neffect of growth on the supply of transport\nis even more significant. As the scale of the\ncity increases, the expansion of the transport capacity above a certain level becomes\nprogressively more costly. The pressure for\nmore capacity tends to occur where the\ngrowth of land-use activities is most intense,\nsince it is these activities which are creating\nthe demand for transport. Continued\ngrowth eventually reaches a point where the\nassociated expansion of traffic capacity\nbecomes incompatible with the expansion\nof land-use activities which give rise to the\ntraffic.\nThus, to summarise, urbanisation generates a more than proportionate increase of\ntravel demand on the one hand, and steeply\nrising costs for meeting that demand on the\nother. In the developed countries this process of escalation is accelerated by increasing affluence which leads both to an overall growth of travel demand and an increasing desire for individuals to use more\nspace-consuming private transport instead\nof public transport. Effective land-use\nplanning has, in many areas, reduced the\ncosts of this future growth by reserving\nspace for the expansion or diversion of\nactivities and services.\nLand-use controls can also prevent the\ncontinuous outward growth of urban areas,\na notable example being the \"green belt\"\naround London. Even so, land-use plans\nfor London and other cities, produced earlier this century, could hardly have foreseen\nTHE URBAN\nTRANSPORT PROBLEM *\nby D.A.M. Gilbert\nthe techno logic ol and economic developments that have taken and are taken place.\nConsequently, in most large cities, transport\ncompetes for space where it is most scarce\nand costly, and transport unfortunately\nrequires a lot of space.\nA number of methods of regulating\ndemand for transport have been considered.\nThe most commonly used method, parking\ncontrol, is almost certainly having a significant effect, in London, on both the ownership and usage of the private car. A method of restraint favoured by economists is \"differential pricing\", and recently\nthe more important technical problems of\ndeveloping pricing equipment, for use on\nroad vehicles, have been overcome. In\nurban areas, transport costs to the user\nhave risen as congestion increased; but\nprices, for example fuel tax and fares, are\ngenerally uniform over the whole urban\narea, and do not increase selectively in\nareas where congestion occurs, and where\nthe cost of meeting the demand is high. A typical example is the city centre where the\ncost of providing extra capacity is extraordinarily high. Yet, the \"prices\" charged\nfor the use of the roads in the centre are\nthe same as elsewhere in the City\u2014although\ncosts to the user due to congestion are\nhigher. If differential road pricing were\nintroduced the price of transport would be\nTHIS IS YVONNE ANTROBUS, WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE URBAN\nTRANSPORT PROBLEM, AND IS INCLUDED HERE PURELY BECAUSE SHE IS THE\nMOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL YOUR FRIENDLY PRESS BARON COULD FIND IN THE\nPHOTO 'FILE'S. cheaper hi some areas whilst in others, the\nmore congested, it would be more expensive than today.\nMany people, particularly motorists,\nobject to the idea of paying more for road\nspace. But of course, there is no' single\napproach or simple solution to the basic\nproblem of imbalance between supply-of\nand demand-for transport services. The\nproblem is extremely complex and requires\nthe working together of people of many\ndisciplines. It was a far simpler task to\nsend three men to the moon for a few\nhours, than it will ever be to transport\n250,000 workers 3 miles in any British city.\nA balanced solution to the urban district\ntransport problem would almost certainly\ninclude some or all of the following measures:\u2014\na) Road building (including improving\nexisting roads as well as building new\nmotorways)\nb) Improvements to both road and rail\npublic transports\nc) Improved transport interchange facilities\nd) Traffic and environmental management\n(e.g. the banning of vehicles from certain\nstreets, bus priorities, the banning of turning movements, etc.).\nAt both strategic and tactical levels land\nplanning would be used to control both\nthe magnitude of transport-demand and the\nways in which this demand could be satis-fie d. At a strategic level the location of\nhousing, industry, offices and shopping\ncentres is closely linked to the level of\ntransport services expected to be available.\nAt the tactical level planning controls can\nbe used to determine the precise location\nof particular land-use activities in order to\neffect efficient linkages with other transport\nservices. Improved transport technology\ncan also make a valuable contribution to\nthe problem.\nHigh-speed belt transporter systems or\n'people movers' and fixed track automated\ntaxis have an obvious role particularly in\ncatering for those trips too far to walk and\nto short to use the underground or car.\n'Dial a bus' systems could perform a useful\nfunction in certain areas with a role between that of a car and the normal bus.\nThe possibilities of improving the transport\nsystem through technology are considerable\nbut again this approach would form only a part of the overall solution.\nThe problem of un balance between\nthe demand for and the supply of transport\nservices in urban areas has always existed,\nand in the developed countries with growth\nin ownership and use of private vehicles,\nthe problem has become particularly acute\nin the past 2-3 decades. At the same time,\npeople have rising expectations of the type\nof environment they would like to live in,\nand this produces a problem which is a direct conflict with their, perhaps stronger,\ndesire to increase their personal mobility.\nThere is little doubt that for most people\na car is a desirable possession and there is\nevery evidence that the majority of the\n40% or so households that do not own a car will obtain one as soon as they possibly\ncan. There are, and will be, more cities\ndesigned for full motor is ation through\nnecessity rather than choice, with motorists\nallowed to move where they like without\nrestraint; cities with drive-in banks,\ncinemas, churches, weight-watchers' clubs\nand the rest. But even in such 'Golden\nCities' there will be numerous problems,\nsome families will not own cars, either\nthrough poverty, disinterest or d is qu ali fic ation. How will these people move about\nfreely if public transport is not economic to\nrun? In the one car household how will the\nhousewife do her shopping, the children\nget to school or the elderly and infirm get\nabout?\nFinally a small point of topical interest,\nwhat would happen to motor transport if\nthe resources of oil were all consumed or\nsupplies were cut off? Some estimates suggest that the world's present stock of fossilised hydrocarbons will last no more\nthan forty years if consumption continues\nat the present rate.\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, MAY13 th,1971 No. 301\nOne of I.C.'s barmaids, Diane, who got through\nto the final of the \" Belle of the bar\" competition.\nFIRE IN BEIT\nThose residents of New\nBeit Hall who fancied a lie-in on the morning of Wednesday, 14th April, were in for\na slight surprise when a fire\nin the first floor kitchen\nnecessitated their rather\nspeedy evacuation at about\n9.30 a.m. Although the hostel filled\nwith dense smoke within a few minutes, most of the residents were able to escape,\nand nobody was harmed.\nLoss of personal property\nwas slight, but the kitchen\nwas gutted, and there was\nconsiderable damage to the\nwalls and ceiling of the corr i dor, resulting in a claim to\nthe insurers of over 2,500.\nThe fire apparently started\nin a plastic dustbin in the\nkitchen, overflowing with a week's rubbish, and was\nprobably due to a carelessly\ndiscarded match or tab-end.\nWhen the fire was discovered,\nthe kitchen was well alight,\nand past the fire extinguisher\nstage. The resident of room\n61, directly opposite the kit-chen, Stephanos Theodossis,\nraised the alarm when he\nopened his door to investigate\nthe loud cracking sounds\nwhich had woken him up \u2014\nthese sounds were in fact the\nkitchen windows cracking\nunder the heat. He lost no\ntime in dashing down to the\nSecurity Guard, whose 999\ncall brought the fire brigade\nin about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile Stephanos had\nreturned to close his own\nroom door, but was unable\nto close the kitchen door,\nwhich (like all the Beit kit-chen s) has no self-closing\nspring. Other residents who\nhad grabbed fire ext in quis h ers were unable to attack the\nfire, owing to the dense\nsmoke. Teak and wire-glass\nfire doors stopped the conflagration reaching the stair-case, but the flames did\nspread the length of\nthe corridor, being propagated in the space between\nthe ceiling and inflammable fibre ceiling tiles.\nWhen the firemen arrived, a30 yard length of ceiling was\nmerrily smouldering away;\nhowever, the blaze was\nrapidly extinguished.\nWhere the fan light windows above the doors were\nopen (and in some cases\nflames) billowed into the\nrooms, leaving the ceiling\ntiles and wall paintwork very\ndirty, or even burnt in places.\nThe ceiling tiles along the\ncorridor were ripped out by\nfiremen and dumped in the\nquad, where they caught fire\nagain and had to be damped\ndown. For good measure,\nthey also ripped out the first\n4ft. of ceiling tiles in all the\nrooms, whether the tiles were\nsmouldering or not.\nAlthough only one fire\nhose was needed, the vehicles\nin Prince Consort Road\nturned in their frustration to\nbreeding, and the fire eventually produced nine fire engines and salvage corps\nvehicles, five police cars, and\none ambulance. Firemen in\nbreathing apparatus carried\nout a search of the Hall and\nled to safety Miss Sherwood\nand Anna Madellis, who had\ndecided to stay in their\nrooms rather than risk the\nsmoke However, the firemen did miss one girl in a third floor room, who somehow managed to sleep\nthrough it all! Stories of 200\npeople evacuated, which\nwere put out by the BBC and\nnational press were alarmist\nand wildly exaggerated \u2014\nthe figure was nearer 12.\nAfter the firemen and salvage corps had departed, the\ncorridor was left in a very\nfilthy state, and smelling\nstrongly of smoke. For the\nnext few days the residents\nhad to put up with the filth\nand stench, but after a slow\nstart the College authorities\ngot round to arranging for\nthe rooms to be cleaned and\nmade habitable before the\nstart of term.\nAs a result of the fire, the\ncorridor and some of the\nrooms must be redecorated,\nnew ceiling tiles must be\nfixed, and electric wiring re-placed, in addition to the\nmajor reinstatement work in\nIthe kitchen. Most of this\nwill be done over the Summer, thus avoiding disturbance to residents during\nexams; which is really just\nas well, considering how\nslowly the powers that be\nare moving, despite pushing\nfrom the Warden and res i dents.\nThe incident has drawn\nattention to the dangerous\nlack of fire escapes from the\n(continued on Back Page)\nATTENTION ALL STUDENTS If you think that the\nplace you are living at is\ngood or even just quite\ngood come into the Union\nOffice and give us the\naddress, cost, size, and the\nname of landlord (also\nwhere he can be contact-ed). Alternatively just put\na note in the internal mail.\nWe are trying to prepare\na list of flats where students have lived to start a Student Accommodation\nBureau. From the beginning of September this\nBureau will be run probably from l.C. Union office\nto help and advise students\non accommodation problems. Please help and provide addresses to get this\nvery needful service started.\nNews in Brief\nAnnounced on 16th April were the winners of the annual\nBest Student Newspaper Competition. FELIX swept the\nfloor by all accounts. It was, however, mentioned that many\nof our stories are complete fabrication. We congratulate\nthe real winners on their success and hope that next year's staff will get FELIX an honorable mention. The best newspapers were those of Leeds and Kent.\n\u2022 \u2022 $ \u2022 $ #\nSuppose you were in charge of a large boiler house in the\nNatural History Museum, and suppose you were exercising\nyour dog in Princes Gardens on the last Thursday of las ll term, and suppose, just suppose, you looked up to the vast\narray of South Side windows, and suppose, good Lord! that\nyou saw, adorning two walls, two large signs pinched out of\nyour own boiler house! Wouldn't you be annoyed? Even\nto the extent of a phone call to Uncle Bill? Perhaps the above\nstory helps to explain why Messrs. Seafood and Stephenson\norganised an urgent search of all South Side rooms on the\nlast day of term, which yielded over 25 signs, including the\nproperty of the V&A, Kensington and Westminster Councils\nand (surprise, surprise) Imperial College!\nThe I.C. Symphony Orchestra's concert last term was a very praiseworthy effort. The standard of musicianship,\nespecially in the string section, was equal to that of many\nprofessionals. Don't miss this term's concert on Wednesday,\n26th May. The programme includes Debussy, Mahler and\nSchubert.\nWith the retirement of Stephenson, the College is taking\nthe opportunity to scrap the post of Senior Warden. A new\npost, College Tutor, is being created, according to Bill \"to\ncontribute to College life at the College-student interface,\nparticularly in non-academic matters.\" The first appointee,\nfor five years, to this experimental post will be Ken Weale, at\npresent Senior Treasurer of the Union and Warden of Falmouth Hall.\nWith Ken's new appointment, and C. Cecil Seaford's retirement as Warden of Selkirk Hall (but he continues as\nDomesticated Beast) two warden ships in South Side are now\nvacant. Regarding Seafood's replacement, to the first mox ed South Side Hall, a successor has already been chosen and an\nannouncement is expected shortly. A short list of three candidates for Falmouth has been sum bit ted to the Union for\ncomment.\nA PLACE TO LIVE By John Sammer\nLast autumn about twenty\nor thirty students were sleeping on the floor of the Union\nbuilding because they could\nnot find anywhere to live.\nThis coming autumn there\ncould be up to fifty in a similar situation. Why is\nthe situation getting worse,\nand what can we do to rectify it?\nFirstly, it should be emphasised that housing is a problem for the government.\nWhy is this? Housing means\npeople, and people mean\nvotes. The reduction of the\nvoting age to 18 has put a powerful weapon in the\nhands of students. They are\na clearly identifiable group\nwith clearly identifiable needs\nand represent about 4 per\ncent of the total voting population. N.U.S. The N.U.S. is to launch a campaign at the start of next\nsession to cash in on the\nusual publicity that the bad\nstudent housing situation\ngets. At Imperial College we\nwill be running an accommodation bureau (see elsewhere\nin Felix) in association with\nU.S.K. Also students coming\ndown to London to look for\nplaces to live will be able to\nfind cheap accommodation\naround college.\nFinally at an individual\nlevel students can help by\nmaking themselves good\ntenants, so that landlords\nactually want students. It\nis a good idea to look for\nsomewhere to live as early as\npossible during the summer as at the end of September the chronic shortage\nof places to live becomes\nacute.\n(This article has been\nedited).\n\n"

(Yes, he used to be . . . many things).\nWhat a good idea, I thought, and flashed my mind back\nover the events of the past months of excitement, passion,\nnausea etc. Carnival seems to have strode ahead and . . .\nWell, something else must have happened.\nThe lecture times changed this year from 9.30 till 5.30\ndaily, and some of the departments used the extra time available merely to cram more lectures into an already overfull\ntimetable, causing the two different types of I.C. students to\nreact in different ways.\nThe workers just had to work harder leaving them even\nless time to pursue any social activities, if they ever did any-way. The majority of I.C. were merely further put off from\ndoing anything by having more lectures to attend and more\nproblem sheets to do, and instead merely slumped back into\ntheir own shells, became more apathetic, and perhaps drank\na bit more beer, coffee, or whatever.\nThe Union is supposed to exist, to a certain extent, to provide a social environment for students and hence some of the\nblame must lie with the officials of the union who seem to\nhave done little more than changing the carpet in Southside.\nUnion meetings this year have been plagued by issues considered to be completely irrelevant by the majority of I.C. Is\nit really necessary for the Y. S.S.S. to spout forth about Bangladesh, Accra, force the Tories to resign, bureaucracy, Police\nBrutality and similar irrelevancies at every discussion that\ncomes up at a Union meeting?\nIt is, however, rewarding to see that the authorities of both\ncollege and union are realising that I.C., instead of providing a training for students that enables them to do something\nuseful afterwards, is just as likely to alienate students from\nsociety and their fellow students leading to critical emotional\nstrain. The college now has two visiting psychiatrists and a social worker who can be consulted by students who feel\nthey need help; nightline has also been instituted for the same\npurpose, and if you feel you do need help, for God's sake\nask for it.\nThis is encouraging in that something is being done for\npeople who cannot handle their problems here; but something\nmust be done in the future to make this place habitable.\nAnd that would seem to be that I'd like to thank everyone who have helped to make this issue of Felix what it is,\nand apologise to all those who contributed articles we couldn't find space for or postponed till later issues. Felix comes out\nagain on Fresher's day, all articles welcome to the Felix rack\nby mid-September.\n\"How about that, Paul?\"\nI looked around. They were all sitting watching the Cup\nfinal (except Kirkham, who was curled up in his basket by\nthe fireplace as usual), eating baked beans.\nPaul looked up.\n\"Looks like dinner won, then, John.\"\nAlt the beginning of this\nterm a number of simple\nposters appeared round the\nCollege advertising: \"Night-line first floor No. 8 Princes\nGardens, Telephone 581\n2468 (external) 2468 (inter-nal). Open 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. every night\". This marked\nthe opening of a new service\nin the College. A service provided by students for stu-dents, trying to help those\nwho, in the middle of the\nnight, simply want to talk to\na friend. They certainly\ndon't have to be suicidal or\ndeeply depressed even to ring\nNightline. The need to talk\nto an understanding person\nwho is really hs ten ing to you,\nis something we all get from\ntime to time. This, simply, is\nwhy Nightline is there.\nThe article in Felix on\nJanuary 28th stressed the\nneed for such a service at I.C. With the help of a few pos-ter s, about 70 people came\nto a meeting where the\nfounder of the Samaritans,\nChad Varah, explained the\npurposes of his organisation\nand its applications here at\nI.C. The name Nightline was\ndecided at the time as being\nthe most suitable.\nThe result of the meeting\nwas a series of lectures, given\nby the Samaritans, about Befriending, Psychological\nproblems and Sexual problems. These were followed by\na forum where people asked\nquestions and discussed the\nplans for running Nightline.\nAbout 80 people attended\nthis course.\nThen followed the \"Sensi-t iv it y Tests\". These were\nconducted in 2-hour sessions\nwith a group of 12 people\neach time. A pair of telephones were connected to the\ninput of an amplifier feeding\na loudspeaker. The 2 telephones were in separate\nrooms with one person at\neither phone, one acting as\ncaller and one as Nightline\nvolunteer. The loudspeaker\nNightline Volunteer, waiting\nwas in a third room with the\nrest of the group and the\nSamaritan conducting the\ntest.\nWhen the caller rang, the\nvolunteer answered, \"I.C. Nightline can I help you?\"\nand a conversation thereby\ndeveloped. After about 5\nminutes the two people were\ncalled back and the rest of\nthe group made comments\non how well (or badly) the\nvolunteer helped the caller to\nfeel better. Based on their\nperformance on these tests\npeople were recommended or\nnot, to act as volunteers on\nthe night lk ie services. Others\nespecially car owners, were\nasked to help with the running of nightline.\nOn duty each night are\nthree people; two of these\nhave passed sensitivity\nand one has not. Of the two\nwho have qualified, one will\nalways be awake and sitting\nby the phone, and the other\nwill be asleep in the same\nroom, the third person will\nbe asleep elsewhere. |\nAs soon as a new caller\nrings, the person by the\nphone answers and also\nwakes up the volunteer beside him to stand by. If the\nvolunteer has to go out to\nthe caller, then the third person is woken and goes\nacross the gardens to get a car and driver and a replacement for the volunteer going\nout. Hence there are always\ntwo people ready to answer\nthe phone at the centre.\nVarious files containing information about a number\nof social services, are kept\nat the centre, so that people\ncan easily be referred to any\nprofessional help they might\nneed. Also a completely anonymous logbook of the various calls, recording the time\nand nature of the call, is\nkept.\nThe calls are referred by\nnumber so that if the caller\nrings again he is saved the\ntrouble of repeating history.\nThis log book exists solely\nfor this purpose, the information contained in it is\nstrictly confidential and only\navailable to the people concerned with that case. Under\nno circumstances is any of\nthe information in the book\navailable to anybody, even to\nthe College Health Centre,\nunless the caller specifically\nasks nightline to inform some\nrelevant authority on his be-half. Even if the log book\nfalls into the hands of an\noutsider it would not mean\nanything to them as all the\ncalls are referred to by number and not by name.\nThe same degree of confidence is a principle to which\nthe Samaritans themselves\nadhere and in over 250,000\ncalls they have answered to\ndate, only one case of suspected breach of confidence\nhas occurred. Since, according to the Samaritans, our\nvolunteers are of the same\nhigh standard, the chances of\nany breach of confidence occurring should be as small, if\nnot smaller.\nJ uP D II ETCHES Unfortunately the year has\nbeen relatively quiet\u2014the\ninevitable lull experienced by\nmost universities after the\nparticipation-type demands\nhave been conceded. \"Diver-s if i cation and Representation\" was a rallying cry.\nThese demands have been\nconsolidated\u2014we need now\nto re-assess our position. Diversification needs representation. Representation has\nbecome committee slog remote from students small adjustments to increasing efficiency ICU needs to reach\nback into its students. Abstract campaigns cannot be\nimposed without the germs\nof spontaneity from you.\nStudent representation has\nnot meant real participation.\nThe most that representation on such as the Board of\nStudies Governing Body\nachieves is information\u2014and\nthen only on that business\nwhich has not been hived off\nto be decided elsewhere.\n(Deans etc.). THE DANGERS OF REPRESENTATION CANNOT BE OVERSTRESSED. It appears as\nthough ICU has been involved in the real decision making\u2014THIS IS NOT TRUE\n\u2014power lies elsewhere, not\non our committees \u2014 our\nstrength lies in the union.\nICU must not deceive itself\ninto thinking it is participating or into becoming identified with the establishment.\nFurther, the student reps are\nimplicated in committee decisions and can easily come\nto identify with those decisions arrived at by sweet\nreason, which are against\nthe student interests. Paradoxically the withdrawal of\nrepresentation is a powerful\nweapon in a conflict situation but 50 per cent representation is a further realistic demand.\nThe Union can be outvoted by the forces of reaction\nand must rely totally on the\ncommitment and involvement of its members. Debating chambers, \"negotiations\"\u2014these are their\nforces and not ours. People\nare just not swayed by pure\n\"reasoned argument\" in a political situation such as is\nbound to exist within a col-leg e. On a very basic level ICU\nneeds to develop a set of\nprinciples, a guiding philosophy. The purpose of a student union is not just the\nsatisfaction of social and\nwelfare needs but to represent its members in the college and outside. Bureaucracy is not enough\u2014it runs\naway with itself. The only\nhope for any union is to involve lots of committed\npeople. At present there is\nan over-reliance on the President\u2014there should be more\naction at the UGMs\u2014yet few\nmotions come from ordinary\nmembers and subsequently\nthere is insufficient identification or involvement. Mandates from below not above!\nCollege affairs are no longer as clear cut and the main\ndebates have been on South\nAfrica, Academic Discipline,\nDecember 8th, Dr. Pain. The\nDec. 8th \"debate\" at least\nproved that it's those who\nwant to avoid free discussion\nthat use standing orders, personal attack, etc. The confrontation tactics of the\nYSSS group at least provoked controversy but again\ntheir opponents just hurled\nabuse instead of discussing\nthe motions. Never say \"the\nleft\" are undemocratic\u2014they\ndon't shout down the\nspeakers.\nOne of the few interesting\nresults of the election campaign was Pete Lambert's principled platform (his subsequent dismissal) and his\n200 supporters. Otherwise,\nthe elections were a retreat\ninto bureaucracy and an\navoidance of the problems,\nIt will be more difficult to\nraise commitment next year\nand the college knows it.\nSocsoc has failed this year\nand next year will be a regression for: ICU unless a lead is taken by them at Union meetings.\n\n"

The ones I have got\nhere though are my favourites of the last month.\nFirstly there is the new\nalbum by an American\ngroup named Sea Train \u2014\nSea Train (Capitol).\nTheir previous album on\nA&M was well reviewed\nbut I didn't hear any of it.\nThis one however I can rec-om mend. The sound is a little countrified with its\nroots in the bluegrass. Good\nmusic for parties but a bit\ntoo loud for late-night (ex-ce pt on headphones). If you\nget to listen to it listen to\n\"Song of Job\", from the\nBible of the same name, the\nbrass riffs do a lot to make\nthe song hum mable without\nbeing remember able. A word\nof warning\u2014watch out for\nbonfire night crackles on side\none. Recording quality is\n\"Thinks\u2014Are Tory members untouched by human\nhand?\"\nOn April 27th, at the Conway Hall, under the auspices\nof the Defence of Literature\nand the Arts Society, Dr.\nMartin Cole of Aston University showed his sex education film \"Growing Up\". The\nfilm is simple, direct and hon-est. Gone are the copulating\nrabbits who for so long were\nthe nearest to human activity\nthat upright educators dare\napproach. Gone too is any\nattempt to impose one sec-tion's morality on another\u2014\nDr. Cole just says what\npeople do, and how and what\ncan result.\nNo doubt it is this honesty which has got up the\nnasal passages of the Birmingham Education Commitgood\u2014recorded in London\nby George Martin.\nOh yes! They've got a fiddle player named Richard\nGreene who does a couple of\ngood country tunes and the\nold (Old) Orange Blossom\nSpecial. Don't buy it for\nO.B. S. though but the rest is\nworth it. There is a single\n\"13 Questions\" taken from\nthe LP.\nMasters Apprentices were\ndescribed to me as the top\npop group from Australia\nand without disrespect to the\nAustralians present, when I heard the album I was amazed by its quality. They\nsound like Led Zeppelin\ncomplete with their own\nRobert Plant but have something refreshing in there as\nwell. There's none of the\nelectronics for a start.\nListen to \"Death of a King\", noted for the lead\nguitarist playing the harmonics of a12 string guitar. Recording and pressing good.\nC.B.S. seem to have almost\nthe monopoly of groups\nsounding like B.S.&T. But\ntee. Keeping facts from the\nyoung \"for their own good\",\nand ladling on the guilt, has\nalways been one of the first\nprinciples of a \"good e duca tion\".\nOn film Dr. Cole states\nthat masturbation is a norm-al, widely practised, and\nhealthy activity for the release of sexual tension. We\nthen see first a man, and then\na woman, masturbating rather joyless ly. These sequences\nseem to have aroused the ire\nof guilty wan kers in town\nhalls throughout the country.\nTo discover that their failing\nsight and continuing mental\ndeterioration are not due to\nself-abuse must be a blow in-deed. The very term \"self-abuse\" oozes guilt from every\nsyllable\u2014to feel that a generation might grow up with-Chicago are successful so\nwhy not Bal'lin' Jack? There\nare more memorable brass\nriffs (\"Telephone\") and a bit\nof tr ad jazz (\"Bal'lin the\nJack\") and a jazz waltz\n(\"Festival\"). This was recorded in the U.S.A. Unlike the\nMasters Apprentices album,\nwhich is hard rock all\nthrough, Ballin' Jack has a bit of sandstone showing\nthrough.\nThere you are then, the\ntitles are the groups' names:\nSea Train (Capitol), Masters\nApprentices (Regal Zonophone), Baffin' Jack (CBS).\nMy best buys of the month.\nFinally, if no-one else has\nmentioned them here are\nsome other albums worth listening to:,\nHooker'n 'Heat (Liberty)??,\nAqualung-Jethro Tull (Chry-sal is), Fiends and Angels\nAgain-Martha Valez (Blue\nHorizon), Dreams (CBS) and\nStrictly Personal - Captain\nBeefheart reissue 99np( Sonet). More good music on\nBreakthrough every Tuesday\nnight, 95.3.\nout this guilt apparently\nrocks the very foundations of\ndemocracy.\nFinally the film considers\nintercourse, and we see a somewhat unimaginative\ncouple banging away with no\ngreat vigour. Throughout the\nfilm the importance of contraception is stressed, an admission that at last people\ndo have sex in a dole sence and that an overcrowded\nworld must not get more so\n\u2014especially with unwanted\nchildren.\nThis is the first really honest sex education film that\nthis country has ever seen.\nIt did not offend me; it\nmight well offend my par-ents' generation, but it is not\nintended for them. It is just\nwhat the children want, need,\nand with a million cubic\nmetres of luck might just get.\nApart from being a disciple of the Greek philosopher\nZeno (342-270 B.C.), STOIC\nis also the ingeniously contrived name of the Student\nTelevision of Imperial College, a recreational club\ndedicated to the pastime of\nmaking television program-mes. This activity is made\npossible by the existence of\na well-equipped studio in the\nElec. Eng. Department,\nwhich the dept. lis wiling to\nhand over to the club when\nit is not in use, but, in re-turn, the club helps with the\neducational programme. (See\nphoto above). You may recall the showing of some\nnews programmes in the\nJ. C.R. last year, including an\ninterview with Mike Raven\n(Who's he?). I remember it\nmore than most because I was tall enough to see over\nall the other people standing\nin the way.\nThe last two sentences\nwere, in fact, all that I knew\nabout STOIC's activities until I found myself repeatedly\ndrinking beer with several\ndubious characters who\nturned out to be the commit-tee. Finally it was suggested\nthat I come along to the\nstudio on a Wednesday afternoon and see what it was all\nabout. Hatching an idea for\nan article, I tagged along to\nThe Consort Gallery is now\nOpen in the Ante-Room i ln College Block. The first exhibition is of prints from the\nRoyal College of Art and\nwill continue until May 21st.( The gallery is open from\n9.30 to 5.30, weekdays only).\nAlso in Auntie's room was\nthe Hi-Fi Soc. demonstration\non the 29th April. Cambridge\namplifiers and speakers\nobserve the making of part\nof a video-tape programme\nintended to inform next year's Freshers about some of the\nCollege's facilities. An interview with Mr. McDowall, the\nGeneral Studios impresario,\nwas in process of being re-corded. Although it was clear\nthat the operators were very\nfamilar with the equipment\nit did seem to me that a little\ncreative ability was lacking\nin the production. There was\nalso a shortage of staff, as I discovered when I was recruited to help!\nApparently, the reason for\nthe sudden termination of the\nJCR News programmes last\nyear was that it was judged\nthat carrying a Monitor and\nRecorder (Video-tape) around might not do them any\ngood. It is hoped, however,\nthat next year this service\nwill be resumed with the aid\nof a cable from the studio to\nthe JCR, obviating the need\nto transport the recorder.\nIn the words of Richard\nParkins, secretary of STOIC,\n\"We hope initially to provide a news/information\nprogramme during the lunch\nbreak, at least 2 or 3 days a week, in the JCR, College\nBlock, and later in the Union\nand Southside. The programme would be something\nlike a visual \"World at One\"\nwere used to produce a sound\nthat to me sounded virtually\nperfect.\nUnfortunately, the records\nwhich were played in the\nmain part of the demonstration were all orchestral/\nchoral types which appeared\nto represent the tastes of the\npresented s rather than\nattempting to provide a varied selection.\nDramsoc staged \"Maria\nwith news of coming events,\netc. Following this would be\nentertainment programmes,\nsome made by STOIC, others\nfrom other colleges.\n\"People would be welcome\nto think up ideas and find the\ncash\u2014STOIC would advise\nand help to make programmes such as features on a club's activities. We would\nalso welcome help from Felix\nstaff on the news program-mes\".\nC.H.: \"Why haven't you\nstarted making programmes\nthis year?\"\nR.P.: \"Well, basically, shortage of money. At the moment we are financed by the\nRCC, but if we can show that\nwe are providing a service, as\nwell as enjoying ourselves,\nwe may be able to obtain a Union grant on the same\nbasis as Felix. This will\nmean in particular that we\ncan pay for the link between\nthe studio and the JCR\".\nOn my return from that\nbrief excursion into inverted\ncommas, I was convinced\nthat this is all a very good\nthing. If the TV monitor\nwas placed so that it could\nbe seen from the Buttery\nqueue, there might be scope\nfor some very long program-mes. Felix might have to\nwat oh out for its circulation,\nthough. Still, I won't be here\nnext year . . .\nMarten or The Red Barn, a Victorian Melodrama\" in the\npenultimate week of last\nterm. As a straightforward\nplay it was bad, as a Victorian melodrama it wasn't bad\nenough.

At any time millions of pounds worth of film\nprint is stock-piled awaiting distribution. The case of \"Perfor-man ce\", which spent almost two years maturing in Warners'\ncans, was well publicised. The latest issue of \"Film\" tells of\n\"Hotel Paradiso\", kept dark by MGM since 1966; \" A Walk\nwith Love and Death\", which the \"Love Story\" band wag gon might carry with it; and for those who thought that \"Midnight\nCowboy\" was Jon Voight's first film, he appeared in an\nearlier film by Paul Williams, director of \"The Revolutionary\", called \"Out of It\" which is still to be released (sic).\nAt present, many films, such as \"Catch 22\", \"Woodstock\"\nand \"Performance\", just aren't going on release widely, because of disagreements within the industry. IncMentally, the\ncompany which refused to distribute \"Women in Love\" (on\nmoral grounds) recent iy presented \"Myra Breckenridge\" and\n\"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" in a double bill.\n\"Deep End\", first seen about six months back at the\nLondon Film Festival, is now showing at Academy One.\nAlthough I 've mentioned the film before, after Its Festival\nscreening, a recap would be in order, since it's highly rec-om mend able. \"Deep End\" is the first film in English by the Polish\ndirector Jerzy Skolimowski, largely filmed in Munich, evidently to reduce the crew size, and set fin a suburban London\npublic baths and swimming pool. Well acted, more like im-pro vised, by John Moulder-Brown, as the shy young male\nattendant, and Jane Asher, as the promiscuous attendant in\nthe women's section with whom he becomes neurotically and\nfatally infatuated. Diana Dors plays a difficult customer,\nIt is to be expected that many of the \"unknowns\" of yes-ter day's films become the stars of today's. And Dustitn Hoffman's latest performance in the title role of \"Little Big\nMan\" (ABC1) shows that his continued success after \"The\nGraduate\" is well justified. It is a long film, perhaps slightly\nover-long, but for both its director, Arthur Perm, who previously made \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"Alice's Restaurant\",\nand Hoffman, \"Little Big Man\" is something of a high\npoint. Indeed, of the films now showing in London, this, in\nmy estimation, is the best.\nright: Jack Nicholson and\nSusan Anspach in \"Five Easy\nPieces.\"\nbelow left: Dustin Hoffman\nand Faye Dunaway in 'Little\nBig Man\" during his \"re-lig io us period.\"\nbelow right: John MoulderBrown and Jane Asher in\n\"Deep End.\"\n(photos by Columbia, 20th Century Fox and Academy)\nThe film, taken from Thomas Berger's novel, is conducted\nin retrospective narrative. Jack Crabb, the 121 year old sole\nwhite survivor, and self-confessed instigator, of Custer's Last\nStand, recollecting to a historian his life 'in the West drifting\nbetween the Cheyenne and the white intruders, associating\nwith legendary figures\u2014Wild Bill Hickock, Wyatt Earp,\nCalamity Jane and General Custer\u2014and app are nU y present\nat many historic occasions\u2014the massacre of the Indians at\nWashita in 1868, and Custer's defeat at little Big Horn.\nAlthough Berger's historian is allowed to observe \"Either\nhe was the most neglected hero in the history of this country\nor a liar of insane proportions\", the epic reminiscences could\nbe called true fiction. Penn shows the dignified civilisation of\nthe Cheyenne, embodied by Little Big Man's adopted grand-father, Old Lodge Skins, magnificently played by Chief Dan\nGeorge. Although an episodic film, with the occasional slapstick scene, such as in the hero's \"gunfighter period\", and a docile ironic humour, what comes through, apart from the\nwoeful history of treaties broken by the white settlers, is more\nthan simple humane sympathy for the Cheyenne, who call\nthemselves \"the human beings\", but rather an honest and\nrefreshing respect.\nThe telling line, that \"the white man hates the human\nbeings\", has intentional significance in the world today\u2014a connection that Arthur Penn does not deny.\nMost people will remember Jack Nicholson as the alcoholic\nliberal lawyer in \"Easy Rider\". In \"Five Easy Pieces\"\n(Prince Charles) he plays Bobby Dupea, an itinerant oil-rig\nlabourer from a middle-class musical background, who resents and cannot come to terms with the oppression s, responsibilities and petty restrictions of his life\u2014from the\ndependent mistress and rush hour traffic to the inflexible\nmenu at a wayside cafe.\nReluctant to ditch his girl-friend Rayette (Karen Black)\nwhen she becomes pregnant, he leaves her in a motel near his\nfamily home, where he has returned to see his dying father,\nhoping she'll go.\nAt home he is indifferent to their earnest intellectual conversation and the unreality of continual music practice. He is\nattracted to Catherine (Susan Anspach), the gentle fiancee/\npupil of his brother Carl, but as they are getting close Rayette\narrives. Caught in an embarrassing trap, with Catherine\nplacing loyalty to Carl and music first, he leaves with Rayette, but at a stop for petrol he hitches a lift on a long-distance\nlorry.\nLike \"Wanda\", Bob Rafelson's \"Five Easy Pieces\" is a documentary, rather than allegorical, approach to the\ndepiction of a broad mass who, whilst not manifesting their\nalienation in \"anti-social\" styles of living, nevertheless find\nthemselves aimless social misfits. Also highly recommend able. "
