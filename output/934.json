    "content": "Feature Felix 934 15 May 1992\nA group from the Imperial\nCollege and North Wales Caving\nClubs visited the Monte Canin area\nin August 1991 for a mixture of\ntourist caving and prospecting,\nhelped by the caving group of\nUdine. This article is intended as an\nintroduction to caving in the area,\nbut does not attempt to deal with the\nintricacies of the route finding,\nabove or below ground. It's left to\nthe visiting cave r to enjoy that part.\nThe caves are predominantly\nvertical, active shaft systems, fairly\ncold, with rock that is often sharp,\nso careful re belaying is required.\nThe lack of any formations might\nmake some feel that the caves lack\ncharacter, being more of a test of\nrigging skills. Such cavers are\nprobably best despatched to the\nshow caves of neighbouring\nSlovenia, where there is abundant\nstal; whilst 'depth junkie' cavers get\non with the sport.\nUp until 1989 the deepest system\non the plateau, and the only one\nwith significant horizontal\ndevelopment, was the Complesso\ndel Col delle Erbe at -935m, between 700m and 800m deep. The\nGortani system has a top entrance\nat 1928m and the water re surges at\nthe Fontana di Goriuda, 2km to the\nNW at 868m altitude. It is likely\nthat the remaining 125m vertical\npotential is flooded. In summer\n1991, ropes were in place on the\n'Via nuova' route, and we\nunderstood that they are replaced\nevery four years.\nThe situation has now completely\nchanged with the discovery of two\ncaves on the Yugoslavian side of the\nridge. Veliko Sbrego involves a520m 'entrance series' of pitches,\nfollowed by 5km of active river\npassage reaching\u20141198m. With the\nCaving on Canin\nMonte Canin is\non the ItalianSlovenian\nborder close to\nAustria. In 1991\nHarry Lock\nvisited its cave\nsystems with the\nIC caving club\n:.f. \u2022 . .y.': v, caves pre-rigged, it currently takes\n40 hours to travel to the end of the\ncave and back. Exploration time\nmust be added on to that! Skalaria\nhas been pushed to \u2014995m, and\nboth caves still have many leads in\nthem. Not surprisingly, they have\nattracted cavers from far afield.\nThunderstorms can occur\nfrequently. Whilst from the\nGortani, one group were delayed\nfor 8 hours at \u2014550m until water\nlevels on the pitches had subsided.\nSome of the caves might first\nhave been visited during World\nWar 1, when the ridge formed the\nborder between Italy and AustriaHungary, and was the scene of\nfierce fighting in which 2,000\nsolider s lost their lives. The area\ntoday has many look-out posts, rock\ntrenches and tunnels with rusty\nshells and grenades scattered about.\nSerious cave exploration started\nin the 1960s. based mainly on the\nm The area was\nthe scene of\n| fierce fighting in\nWW I2000 soldiers lost\ntheir lives\nA Michele Gortani. The plateau is\nbeing chiefly worked on by cavers\nfrom Udine and Trieste. The\nTrieste groups (CGEB and SAG)\nhave been responsible for the finds\non the western part of the plateau,\nfrom the Cuel Sclaf to Monte Poriz.\nThe Udine group (CSIF) have been\nworking on Col Lopic and Monte\nRobon, with un prospected limestone further east. Members of\nBritish clubs (MUSS, BCC, BPC)\nvisited the area in the 1970s, mainly\n\u201410\u2014\n15 May 1992 Felix 934 Feature\nm MW TT to assist in the exploration of the\nComici.\nThe area (8km x2 km) is not\nintensively caved. During four\nweeks in Summer 1991 we only met\nother caving groups on three\noccasions. The future potential is\nenormous.\nThe remoteness of the caves\nmakes rescue a very serious\nproposition. During the exploration\nof Veliko Sbrego, an accident drew\ncavers from all over northeast Italy\non a major operation that lasted\nseveral days. Our closest call was\nduring a four-man trip to the bottom\nof the Gortani. One of the group\nmissed the turn-off to the terminal\nsiphon and ended up falling 20m into it from a slippery ledge above,\nhitting the rock walls on the way\ndown. He escaped with damaged\nforearm ligaments and a gashed\nface, and managed to struggle out\nfrom \u2014892m with one good arm,\nmild hypothermia and recurring\ndouble-vision, albeit in a total trip\ntime of 28 hours!\nSella Nevea, at 1170m is the most\nsuitable place from which to base\nexploration of the area. The ski\nresort is rather small, with a lack\nof caving essentials such as cheap\naccommodation, bars, restaurants\nand food shops. At the Western end\nis a field allocated for camping, but\nsince it has no facilities, discreet\nroadside camping, to the east and\noutside of the village, is just as\ngood. The CAI Rifugio Julia is\nanother possibility, if your budget\nwill stretch. The nearest\nsupermarket is the small one in\nTarvisio, a30 minutes drive to the\nnortheast. There does not even\nseem to be a 'superstore' in Udine,\nso it might be worth buying cheaply\nin bulk before arriving in the area.\nAccess to the plateau is by the\ncable car ('Funivia'), with a return\ncharge of about \u00a35 to climb 700m in a few minutes. Well worth it!\nDuring the descent, two or three\ndays later, with the cable car filled\nwith dirty, tanned, hungry, stinking\ncavers and countless muddy tackle\nsacs, it was always fun to watch the\ndisbelief on the faces of the tourists.\nMend-a Bike\n\u2022 BICYCLE REPAIRS \u2022 SALES AND HIRE \u2022 NEW AND USED BIKES \u2022 ACCESSORIES OPEN: O.

BIKES ALREADY DISCOUNTED.\nThe cable car offers rapid access\nto the plateau in winter, from where\nlocal cavers have ski i ed to reach\ncaves, often kept clear of snow by\nthe draught from within. Winter\nbrings extra risks though. The\nBivacco Davanzo-Vianello-Picciola\nis named in memory of the first\nthree cavers to reach the bottom of\nthe Gortani, but who were swept\naway by an avalanche on return\nfrom the same trip as they\ndescended in the dark towards the\nlights of the Rifugio Gilberti.\nFor Col Lopic and Monte Robon.\non the eastern end of the plateau,\nit makes better sense to use Sentieri\n637, despite the one and a half hour\nascent. All the paths marked on the\nmap are well marked on the ground,\nbut there are no others, the rest of\nthe terrain being hard-going over\ns cree or pavement.\nCamping is not really feasible on\nthe plateau, mainly because of the\nlack of soil, the frequent storms,\nand the existence of perfectly good\nbivouac huts. The Bivacco DVP (as\nnamed before) at 1930m is used as\nHe escaped with a damaged forearm\nand a gashed face and managed to\nstruggle out from -829m with one\ngood arm, mild hypothermia and\nrecurring double vision\nthe base for exploring the Gortani,\nwhile the Bivacco ModonuttiSavoia at 1900m is used for the cave\nof the same name. They both\nprovide bunk beds for 12 and a cooking stove (bring your own gas).\nWater is collected from nearby\nsnow patches and rivulets, but is not\nplentiful.\nUnfortunately, being partly\nfunded by the CAI, the bivouacs are\nnot locked, and are open to all,\nwhich means regular visits during\nthe day by walkers. Our group had\n500m of rope and 50 hangers stolen\nfrom a hiding place near the\nBivacco MS. Be warned! The\nRifugio Gilberti at 1850m is busy\nduring the day, but in the evening,\nafter the last cable car has\ndescended, it provides a great place\nto seek warm shelter and gaze out\nover the limestone bathed in\ncrimson light, whilst sampling the\nwell-stocked bar...\nUp-Date\nIC is planning a return for 1992 to\nconcentrate on prospecting and\nextending known caves.

The\nfilm is everything you could want:\nmurder, sex, mystery, humour,\nhorror and all in one hell of a plot.\nUnlike many films, it was difficult\nto guess the ending.\nThe murder scenes are bloody\nand graphic, the sex is shocking and\nexplicit. (I wonder how many tried\nthe scenes after). Contrary to Boris\nthe film is very deep and\npsychological. If you're watching\ncarefully (Boris) the psychology\nwill do you some damage (do your\nhead in).\nBoris, how can the film be about\nthe director's fears when he didn't write the script. Joe Eszterhas,\nformer Rolling Stone reporter wrote\nthe script and Paul Verhoevans\ndirected the film.

It reflects far more on\nMr Stokes than on Boris that the\nformer throws a strop at a review\nof a film he personally liked.

As an impulsive act of\ndesperation I strode up to the\n'ringleader', held out my hand for\nhis drink, promptly threw it back in\nhis face and said: 'It's rude to\npoint'. To protect themselves from\nhumi lit ation one of the group\nretaliated with his drink. The\nringleader followed us as we moved\noff the dancefloor and threw\nanother drink at me. Most of the\ndancefloor must have been aware\nwhat was going on. The group then\nwent away laughing.\nSeveral minutes later the\nringleader approached us. We\nthought he'd come to apologise, but\nhe'd come to hassle us more. At this\npoint my friend screamed at him\nseveral times to 'fuck off.

No longer would we feel\nso guilty about leaving lights or the\ntelevision remote control on when\nwe don't need them, because\nconventional power stations would\nbe a thing of the past. They would\nno longer be there to billow carbon\ndioxide into the atmosphere. Roads\nwould be cleaner and somehow\nquieter; life would be very nice,\nthankyou.\nBut I think there is something in\nmost of us which says 'wait a minute - this is just a wee bit too\nperfect. There has to be a catch to\nall this.' You tend to feel--as ,I imagine you would upon hearing\nthe news that you had won a timeshare apartment... 'and all you\nhave to do to claim your fabulous\nprize is book an appointment with\none of our salespeople...' In a word\nyou would feel dubious, which is a bit how I felt upon arrival at the\nCentre for Alternative Technology\nin the heart of the Welsh\ncountryside. I honestly support\nanything which will reduce mans'\nimpact on the environment, but I was worried that it would all turn\nout to be unworkable and a disappointment. Maybe we would get\nthere to find the place staffed by\nageing hippies who had somehow\nescaped from the sixties.\nI was to be pleasantly surprised.\nI arrived at the house where I was\nstay at about midnight. It had\nseemed a long journey, so I was\nAlternative Technology\nUtopia or Fool's Paradise ?\nChantelle Ward\nof the\nEnvironmental\nand Appropriate\nTechnology\nSociety finds a personal\nviewpoint.\nglad to receive a warm welcome\nand an even warmer milky drink\nbefore I went to bed. I awoke the\nnext morning to find someone in the\nkitchen cooking copious quantities\nof breakfast. The smell was wafting\ntemptingly up the stairs, so what\ncould I do to resist? I took the\nopportunity to look around; there\nwas an array of organically grown\nfood on the farmhouse style table,\nand the shelves above the sink held\njars of all kinds of things which\nreminded me of an old-fashioned\nsweet shop. My wander took me\ninto the lounge, where I nearly fell\nover a sleeping man, who said, 'Hi,\nI'm Dave, I help here...' and\npromptly went back to the land of\nslumber.\nIn the meantime, everyone else\nwas up, so we trudged off to earn\nour keep. We were told beforehand\nthat we would be working on the\nlake, which to me just looked\nornamental but I was assured that\nit would be used to generate\nelectricity when there was a shortfall. We levelled out ground,\nsorted out boulders to go around the\nperimeter of the lake and dug a hole\nfor a reason I never quite\nunderstood. Everyone felt that it\nwas okay for the day, but on the\nwhole we were glad we had settled\nfor an academic career! We all\nwanted to have a bath after a day\nin the grime, but we were\ndisappointed with the solar panel\nwater heating\u2014or rather lack of it.\nSo we descended on the local\nhostelry in true Imperial College\nstyle whilst others in our group who\nwere a bit more cultured stayed in\nto watch some videos - even here\nthey had televisions and videos.\n\n"

It was an\nancient land, a land that\nhad had battles both civil\nand national. It had enjoyed good\ntimes and suffered bad, but where\nthis story begins it was the general\nconsensus that it was having a bad\ntime.\nBeing the cm np let el g ft ct ttt mta at art j of an empire in tl je3s lea nf Huperbtfrea. Snacribefl, in part, b \u00a3 i large It was ruled over by a mighty Emperor, who was ruled over by his beautiful wife. He was not long for this world and was\ndetermined to leave a concrete folly by which future generations would know him. His vast and wealthy Empire was division ed into a number of ministries and departments housed in the imposing Surefire Fortress. For instance, the Ministry of Food, run\nby Sir Easteregg, was responsible for the rations of the citizens; the Ministry of Truth, run by Sir Stefan de Brash, covered\nforeign affairs; the Treasury was run by Baron von Nichtstadt; the Civil Service was under Lady Renard; the Department of\nCollectivisation and Fabrication was run by Lieutenant Tristan Khartoum and the Ministry of Statistics was under Baron von\nMich.\nThings had got rather bad of late - many of the ministries had been reorganised to cope, indeed the Department of\nCollectivisation and Fabrication had to resort to martial law to work at all. This was because the Department has squandered\nall its money on building a city way out to the west which nobody wanted to live in, and which could not be sold. The poor\ncitizens who had tied cottages in the Empire had to pay more taxes to cover up this mistake. In addition to this misery, the\nprevious years had seen swarms of bandits and brigands plaguing the Empire and a new militia had been brought in to thwart\nthem. In their bright schutzstaffel uniforms they fearlessly patrolled the cities of Surefire, Blight and the Royal Gardens, but\nthey never dared reach the wild southern province of Eiblin.\nAs ever, the poverty and wretchedness of the citizen's lives led to stories of wild extravagance in Surefire - for instance that\nthey had grace-and-favour mansions in the Royal Gardens and the Royal Gate, when all about them citizens slaved to scrape\ntogether the taxes exacted by the Department of Collectivisation and Fabrication. Other stories took the form of ignoble\nallegations about some high placed military man - surely untrue! The tale related that this man lived with a cook, one of the\nbest in the land. Her wares were sold for miles and many a feast was celebrated with a toast to her infinite prowess. The\nstory ran that even though his wife was so talented, the man was deeply in love with the fair Madame Isolde de Spasm. And\nwhat heightened the tragedy was that Madame de Spasm only wanted the baby her own husband denied her.\nThe oppressed people in the land did not like any of their overlords, and they got utterly fed up with their mistakes,\nindiscretions and extravagance, but there seemed to be very little they could do about it. Many had forgotten the gallant\nknight who had fought their cause so many times before. Sir Otto d 'Oignon, and his fearless-though-unpredictable-and-rather-eccentric cat, had a mission to bring the overlords to justice, to defend the citizens, to fight for a decent place to live and a reduction in taxes. The citizens demanded some action from the Empire, but as usual nothing was done and so the story\ncontinues...\n\u201418\u2014\n\n"

It is supposed to be\na streamlined version of a Union\nGeneral Meeting ( U GM), introduced because the Union\ncouldn't offer any reasons for\nanyone to turn up to UGMs any\nmore. The general idea is that\nstudents are represented by their\ndepartmental reps., by the societies\nthat they are members of, and by\nthe constituent college unions that\nthey are forced into. That means\nthat the current council has a total\nnumber of fifty six posts, which are\nfilled by fifty one people.\nStreamlined council? Steaming\nquagmire, more like.\nWhilst the representation is\nwonderful, the only problem is that\ndeserve. Try counting the number\nof sabbaticals that turned up at the\nlast EG M in the Junior Common\nRoom on Thursday 7th. Eins, zwei,\ndrei....\nThe most widespread impression\nof last Monday's council was that\nit was so incredibly boring. Well,\nnot incredibly. Predictably boring.\nTo avoid debate, searching\nquestions, and accountability, then\nsubmit your report to council just\n30 minutes before it starts. Or be\na sabbatical. Hand it in at five to\nsix. That way no-one knows what\nthey are talking about. This is\ndangerously suspicious. The third\nterm is a time when union and\nSherfield watchers are tied up with\nexams, and so is an idea time to slip\nA Spanner in the Works\nchance you want to submit a motion, the deadline is Thursday 21\nMay at 12.30pm. You have been\nwarned.\nHow many elections is that this\nyear? Numerous EG M elections,\ntwo sets of sabbatical elections, a general election, local elections,\nand rescheduled EG M elections.\nAll well and good. Democracy (sic)\nin action. Now add another. There\nwill be a Union Annual General\nMeeting on 23 June, for the posts\nof Haldane Library Book Buyer,\nHaldane Library Record Buyer,\nFelix Business Manager, and\nOrdinary Members of House\nCommittee. Now who's going to be\nhere on 23 June? About as many\npeople as turned up for Council last\nMonday.\nNext on the agenda was the most\namazing report tabled at Council in\nliving memory. At best, it was an\nencouragement to the sabbaticals to\nget more involved with their Union.\nAt worst, it implied 'resign now'.\nJ suggest ... that sabbaticals\nactually attend MSC meetings ...I can't recall the last time a sabbatical\ncame to a meeting ... if sabbaticals\nMB IC Union held a Council meeting\non Mondayone of many this\nyear. Do you\nknow anything\nabout them?\nDeclan Curry\nreports\nnot everyone turns up. In fact, it can\nsometimes be argued that hardly\nanyone turns up. Those that turn up\nrarely argue. Or have arguments\n!\nsuppressed. It's a bit of a vicious\ncircle. Of course, it is exam time,\nan excuse well mono polis ed by the\nsorry collection of apologies that\nthundered their way into the Union\nOffice last Monday.\nThe latest gathering of quagmire\nwas in the Union Dining Hall last\nMonday. Not that you knew about\nit, of course. The members are so\nbusy representing you that it\nbecomes a bit of a bore for them to\ntell the ordinary citizens that an\nimportant meeting is taking place.\nBut if you are not going to turn up\nat the UG Ms or the EG Ms( Extraordinary General Meetings),\nthen you have no-one else to blame.\nYou get the representation you\nthings past. And as time slipped past\nduring Council, so did the schemes.\nThe first dodge was trying to\nexcuse the last pathetic EG M. That\nwas a miserable affair. No sound\nsystem, a missing sabbatical, and a distinct lack of participation.\nThankfully, someone called\nquorum, and to the credit of all, this\nhappened after the important\nbusiness of Hon Sec ratification was\ndone. That only left elections for\nHouse Committee Chairman,\nPublicity Officer, Academic Affairs\nOfficer, Post Graduate Affairs\nOfficer and Transport Officer\nhanging in the air, along with\nmotions on 'Third World' Debt. So,\nquestion: How do you deal with a disastrous EGM? Answer: Call\nanother. And that's just what they\ndid. The next EG M is Thursday 28\nMay at 1pm in the JCR. If by\nthe threat of\nimposed reform\nhung heavily\nover this council\nmeeting\nwish to disown or not be involved\nin the work of the MSCs then I for\none would be happy to remove them\nfrom our constitution ...

She is chased by noble\nand rich bachelors of Parma, but\nher heart belongs to Giovanni.\nTheir love has to be secret,\nhowever, for the two are brother\nand sister. Only two people know\nof the incest: Annabella's tutor ess, who finds nothing wrong with it,\nand Friar Bonaventura. Giovanni is\ntoo intelligent to be impressed by\nthe Friar's fire-and-brimstone\nspeeches, yet too naive to grasp the\nworldly implications of his sin.\nAnnabella is more susceptible to the\nFriar's theology and marries a nobleman to save her soul from\ndamnation. At that time, however,\nshe already knows she is pregnant.\nThis is only the main line of\naction in Shakespearecontemporary John Ford's 'Tis Pity\nShe's a Whore. Almost every\ncharacter in this unrelenting play\ndisplays dubious morals in some\nway. \"Justice has fled to heaven\nand comes no nearer.\"\nIn the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany's production showing at\nthe Pit the directness of Ford's play\nis preserved. They transposed it into\na beginning- of-the-century Italinan\nmafia setting. This is very clever,\nfor it makes the incredible brutality\nin the play plausible today, and it\nisn't forced. Saskia Reeves and\nJohnathan Cullen are convincing as\nAnnabella and Giovanni, and\nJohnathan Hyde gives a brilliant\nimpression of a nobleman's ruthless\nright hand. If you go, brace yourself\nfor the end, it's gruesome.\nBoris\n\u2022 'Tis Pity She's a Whore MonSat at 7.30pm( some days also 2pm) at the Pit in the Barbican. Tickets\n\u00a313.50 or student standby \u00a37.\nHenry IV Part 2\n1 sat down feeling unenthusiastic\nand expecting the worst. I was\npleasantly surprised. Again, as in\npart one I found the set design\nobtrusive and crude. I don't see\nwhy, in a scene in Eastcheap, the\nset should get belly laughs all\nround. I also found some of the\nscenes a little tedious. Many people\nseemed to think that Robert\nStephens' Falstaff was excellent. I disagree. I found his performance\nflighty and ineffectual. As the night\nwent on this became less distracting\nas Michael Maloney and Julian\nGlover came into their own and\nswept me away with their\nperformances.\nIt's not difficult to make\nShakespeare powerful, but I think\nit's exceptional for it to be moving.\nThe scene where the King is dying\nand Hal takes the cro-breathtaking. The King ,dressed in\nsports top, cut off jogging pants and\nunshaven gave a raw portrayal of\na king undone, a defeated man,\nwho, consumed by his guilt, was\nwaiting to die. Philip Voss as the\nLord Chief Justice and David\nBradley as the aged, tottering,\nJustice Shallow were superb. The\ncoronation scene was spectacular\nand the only occasion in these\nproductions where I felt that Bob\nCrowley's set design gelled.\nOverall, I'd recommend seeing\nHenry IV parts one and two. Don't be put off if you've not read (or\nstudied) the plays, you don't need\nto have to be able to enjoy it.

    "content": "News Felix 934 15 May 1992\nSports New IC Hostel\nImperial College Sports centre will\nbe closed for extensive renovations\nfor all of the first term next year.\nThe renovations were due to be\ncompleted over the summer\nvacation, but the Sports Centre\nManager, Ray Coleman, said that\nthe delay was due to 'endless\ncommittees'.\nImperial College Sports Centre\nhas been a source of controversy\nsince the beginning of term when\nthe changes were proposed. Its\nmanagement has been criticised by\nacademic staff and students alike for\nbeing run 'un democratically' and\nfor becoming profit orientated\nrather than a service to the college.\nA letter in the last edition of\nNetwork, an Imperial College\npublication, called for a users'\nmeeting to discuss the changes and\nan explanation of the costs of the\nproposed renovations.\nMr Coleman said that the Sports\nCentre would be closed from\nAugust 9th until 2nd January. He\nsaid that the loss of Sports facilities\nto incoming students would be\nunfortunate but that arrangements\nwere being made to find alternative\nvenues for clubs and students during\nthe first part of the next academic\nyear. (i CNN) Shorts\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, yesterday\nrejected proposals to introduce two\nyear degree courses at Imperial\nCollege. Speaking to / CNN, Sir\nEric said that they were not suitable\nfor institutions producing serious\nscientists, though he was 'not\npersonally opposed' to two year\ndegrees within the university\nsystem. This opinion is shared by\nProfessor Stuart, Dean of the Royal\nCollege of Science, who said that\nthe proposals would be 'suitable for\nsome courses there is a small\nbody of students that would\nbenefit.'\nThe comment follows the\nrecommendation to introduce a semester system at King's College\nLondon (KCL). A working group\nof five senior academics at KCL have proposed that the academic\nyear be split into three 13 week\nteaching terms, followed by two\nweeks holiday and a fortnight of\nexams. In a two year degree course,\nstudents would take all three terms,\nwhile students on a three year\ncourse would only take two terms\nin any one year.\nThe Rector. Sir Eric Ash, said this\nweek that the College was\nconsidering the purchase of a former Ministry of Defence hostel\nto provide more student\naccommodation. Furse House is\nsituated on 37-41 Queens' Gate\nTerrace and is said to be capable of\nhousing 200 students. The hostel\nhas large rooms on the basement,\nground and first floors that could be\nused for recreational purposes,\nmeeting places and teaching rooms.\nThe Rector said that T would give\nmy right arm to get it I would\nhate to see it go to a lesser academic\nestablishment.'\nThe cost of acquiring the property\nis described as 'considerable.' The\nRector said that the College could\nborrow part of the required sum,\nbut he did not believe that the\ncollege could increase the deficit on\nthe student residences account,\ncurrently running at \u00a32 million. The\nremainder of the money is to be\nraised by what is described as\n'alternative means.' The IC\nZoe Hellinger, Imperial College\nUnion President, announced this\nweek that the College is considering\na merger with the Charing Cross\nWestminster Medical School. The\narchitect of the proposal has been\nnamed as Professor Peter Richards,\nDean of St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool and pro-Rector of Medicine.\nThe announcement comes after\nrumours that the College was to\nmerge with a postgraduate medical\nschool, and after reports from\n'London Health Emergency' that\nCharing Cross Hospital was to be\nclosed when the government\nappointed Tomlinson Inquiry team\nreports in the immediate future.\nImperial College merged with St\nMary's Hospital Medical School in\n1988.\nA merger between IC and a postgraduate teaching hospital\nwould fuel speculation that IC\nwishes to become a graduate school\nin the long term, admitting\npostgraduate students only. Ms\nHellinger, in a report to ICU\nCouncil, wrote that she 'will be\ndiscussing the wider effects of this\nmerger on the students and the\nstudents' union with the intention of\nproducing a report for Governing\nBody.'\nProfessor Richards said that he\nhad submitted a paper to the IC\nBoard of Studies on the possibility\nof mergers after the publication of\nthe Tomlinson report. The paper.\nDevelopment Office is to hold a function in the Rector's residence\non 20 May designed to 'solicit\nfinancial and advisory support from\nleading alumni ... about the\npossibility of acquiring the\nproperty.' A viewing party will\nmeet in the Rector's residence for\ndrinks, and then return for a buffet\nreception after viewing.\nThe comments follow the recent\nnews that IC Estates may be on the\nverge of guaranteeing two year of\ncollege accommodation to all\nstudents. The proposals was floated\nat a recent 'Residence' meeting.\nThe Estates Department believe that\nthe guarantee could increase the\nnumber of undergraduate student\napplications to Imperial. A complementary approach is\nbelieved to have been prepared to\nincrease the number of postgraduate\napplications. Estates are reported to\nbe planning the development of\n'luxury' postgraduate\naccommodation.\nwhich has now gone to the IC\nGoverning Body, said that Imperial\nMedicine was 'small and strong'\nand would develop by harnessing\nscientific strength. He added that\nCharing Cross Westminster had\nproduced its own position paper in\nthe last week. A spokesman for\nCharing Cross Hospital told / CNN that things were 'tied up with the\nTomlinson Inquiry.' Charing Cross\nHospital is one the twelve teaching\nhospitals being investigated by Sir\nBernard Tomlinson's Inquiry team,\nwhich is looking into levels of\nhealth care provision in London.\nSpeculation is that the Tomlinson\nInquiry will argue for the closure\nof two London hospitals and one\nteaching hospital. John Lister, of\npressure group 'London Health\nEmergency,' said that they expect\nSt. Thomas and Charing Cross to\nbe shut. There is also speculation\nthat University College Hospital\nwill close.\nAn independent inquiry being\ncarried out by the 'King's Fund\nLondon Initiative' has called for a 'radical change to London's medical schools.' In a working\npaper that expresses serious\nconcerns about the viability of\nteaching hospitals in London,\nLondon's medical schools are\nchallenged to 'lessen their reliance\non teaching hospitals in order to\nbroaden and improve education in\nthe capital.'\nRCSU....\ncontinued from front page\nfrom the C CU budget is illegal.\nThe total claimed cost of these\ncomplementary ball tickets has been\nleaked to i CNN. The claimed cost\nfor the Royal School of Mines C CU is stated as \u00a3450, that for City and\nGuilds Union has been stated as\n\u00a3660, and the RCSU has reportedly\nclaimed for \u00a3 9 8 0 in lieu of\ncomplementary tickets, though this\nfigure may have been inflated by\nother miscellaneous and unspecified\nexpenditure. It has been reported to\n/ CNN that the RCSU cash crisis\nbegan when the Senior Treasurer\nrefused to sign cheques until a firm\ncosting was produced for the RCSU\nMay Ball. The Ball was initially\nadvertised as featuring the Capital\nRoadshow, though this did not turn\nup, reportedly due to extraneous\ncircumstances.\nHeadlock\nAn opportunist thief was caught on\nMonday by two members of the\nPhysics department. Dr Nick\nFranks, Reader in the Biophysics\nSection, challenged a man found in\nthe department rummaging through\na jacket. The man said that he was\nlooking for the career's office, so\nDr Franks decided to escort him\nthere. At the Blackett Security lodge\nthe stranger seriously assaulted\nAndy Jenkins, one of Dr Frank's research students who had helped\nescort him. He escaped out onto\nPrince Consort road followed by the\nphysicists but was caught by Mr Jenkins, and put in a head lock by\nDr Frank (an ex Old Mill-Hillian\nwing-Forward).\nWhen the man asked to be let go,\nDr Franks replied 'I 've waited for\nyears to catch someone like you,\nand I'm not going to let you go\nnow.' A Police patrol van happened\nto be passing and the thief was taken\nto Rochester Row police station\nwhere he has been charged with\nburglary and assault.\nBiology\nBiology students will be issued with\na questionnaire on the future of\ncourse structures in the department\ntoday (Friday). This follows\nconcern over leaked proposals to\nhalve the number of second year\nBiology options.

'We are\nconnected to the National Grid\naren't we?'\n'Oh no', she replied, with a slightly scolding expression on her\nface. 'That goes against everything\nwe stand for here'. Yet no one I spoke to seemed obsessed with self-sufficiency, they just possessed\ncommon sense.\nSunday was the bit we had all\nbeen waiting for\u2014the grand tour of\nthe area, although I felt I knew the\nplace a little by now already. We\nduly assembled at ten and kicked off\nwith a tour of an energy efficient\ndemonstration house. Apparently,\nthis is one of the major aspects of\nthe alternative technologies, but it\nisn't very newsworthy and it is\ndifficult to make an interesting\nexhibition out of it as well, so we\ndidn't really dwell on it. Most of the\npeople living on the site had built\ntheir own houses; an achievement\nas not all of them came from a building background.\nThen we were shown the\ntrademarks of alternative\ntechnology - those aspects everyone\nthinks of as soon as that phrase is\nmentioned. For instance, wind\nturbines, water wheels and solar\npanels. This is not to say they were\nboring - some of the designs looked\nquite innovative.\nNext was our guide's pride and\njoy - the sewerage system. I hadn't thought of that as being alternative\ntechnology before, but it was\nbrilliant in its simplicity of design.\nThe waste for the site was passed\nthrough a series of tanks which\ncontained different plants, their role\nwas to extract all the nutrients from\nWORLD LEADERS IN INDEPENDENT TRAVEL\nLow cost flights on\nquality airlines\nSpecial fares for\nstudents\nWeekend breaks, tours\n& group bookings\nWell travelled\nconsultants to guide\nyou\nOver 120 offices worldwide\nPick up a copy of your free\nSTA Travel Guide\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nPrince Consort Road\n(Open Mon-Fri 10-5.30pm) \u2022 j ff i ES S ULU TRAVEL\nthe water, rendering it safe. The last\ntank was even made into an\nornamental pond! What is more,\nthere was almost no smell at all. I think that everyone present was\nimpressed, despite the subject\nmatter.\nThe next stop was the organic\ngarden, which is maintained at least\nin part by the school groups who\ncome to stay. The soil is fertilised\nwith rotted vegetable peelings and\neggshell from the kitchens. It was\nfrom here onwards that I really\nbegan to see the inter-relatedness of\nit all. They grew their own food,\nproduced their own power and dealt\nwith the waste afterwards, all\nwithout damaging anything, not\nleast their standard of living.\nHowever, as our guide admitted,\nhaving the right attitude counts for\na great deal and living in such a close community can produce\ntension at times. Technical teething\ntroubles can also be a nuisance even\nthough they are expected, as with\nanything new, and progress can\nbring moral dilemmas of its own.\nFor instance, they have just built a new cliff railway to transport ever\nincreasing numbers of visitors up\nthe steep hill, but they will need to\nbe connected to the National Grid\nfor the first time ever to provide\nback-up power.\nIn the car on the way home, I mulled it over. The centre wasn't the perfect model, but life is never\nanywhere near paradise anyway.\nThe technologies certainly work\nand there is no drop in the standard\nof living, but communities like this\nwill never happen until there is\nwidespread changes of attitude. It\nmight all sound cranky, but if it\nworks who can criticise? If you still\naren't sure about the whole thing\nthen why don't you come and see\nfor yourself?\nThe technologies\ncertainly work\nand there is\nno drop in\nthe standard\nof living.\n\u201413\u2014\n\n"

As 'it's part of my job' (as Steve told me\n- and he did' want his name\nmentioned as much as possible), it\nwouldn't do for me to get bored\nsince the club won't be such a relief\nforce in my life this term.\nAs they say, 'I 'll start from the\nvery beginning'... no, I 'll control\nmyself and not burst into song. The\nautumn term was a very busy time\nfor the club, with pleasant (well in\nEngland, it couldn't really be\ndescribed as 'fantastic') weather\nand many beginners. They were all\ntrying to win the race (to Southside\non Tuesday at 12.30pm) to sign up\nfor inclusion into 'the elite 13'\ngoing to the reservoir the following\nweek. All that seems a very long\ntime ago, including the Gosport\ntrip, after which the elections for the\npost of secretary took place. What\nexactly do I recall of that period?\nBeing very keen to do things to 'get\nbrownie points' which would be to\nmy advantage in the elections.\nThese included Felix articles, if I'm correct, and not the usual kissing of\nbabies. There were also lessons at\nthe reservoir, very occasionally\nventuring onto the water when the\nweather permitted.\nWhat exactly did we do in\nGosport? Surprisingly, we went\nwindsurfing! We also played\ndrinking games, arcade games and,\na few of us, got tied up into a telephone boxes. Hmmm... I don't think I 'll get changed in the woods\nin future. Apart from the shocked\nlooking passer-by s, there were a few too many brambles.\nWhere else did we go? The\nGower was our second trip and yet\nagain, we did some windsurfing,\nand even some surfing. Despite the\nfreezing cold temperatures, and\nbreaking the leg off one of the\nchairs, we also experienced the\ndelights of the local Welsh disco.\nWe were also supposed to go to\nCornwall, but as per usual, our van\nwas cancelled at the last minute. As\nit happens, we had a extremely\nsuccessful trip to Wyeboston. There\nwe went go-karting, piloting and\nalso used quads. Those were only\nthe motorsports. We also managed\nto do some jet skiing and water-skiing. We enjoyed ourselves so\nmuch that it was a blessing in\ndisguise. It wasn't the only non-windsurfing trip we had that term;\nwe also had an evening out on the\ntown - pub-crawling and even\nstopping in a kar ioke bar.\nAfter the Christmas holidays, bad\nweather conditions (the cold, ice\nand no wind) threatened to force the\nclub into a un recoverable decline.\nHowever, the club survived.\nInstead of floundering in the\nreservoir, we went bowling, played\nlaser tag and used slides at\nFantaseas Waterpark. One\nWednesday, we even spent some\n- a long weekend in Cornwall.\nQuite strange setting out on a7 hour\ndrive at 6.30 in the evening.\nAnyway, those of us who were\nrelegated to the back of the van had\na great time playing cards and even\nbeing able to lie down comfortably.\nAmazingly, it was one of the few\ntrips we didn't have to put up with\nun tuneful singing from the front!\ntime in Richmond Park playing\nfootball and using the skateboards\nfrom the speed sails. Steve, you\nwere lucky that you didn't injure\nyourself on those skateboards,\nunlike those on our second trip to\nGosport. What a weekend!. It was\nalmost cancelled by the van\nmonster, but in the end we had a great time sailing. Shame about the\ntiming of your injury Steve,\nespecially as it was in the morning\nof the first day before the day was\nout.\nThe next two outings occurred in\nquick succession. The Friday before\nthe end of term, we went out for a club dinner. We all ate well and\ndrank well. When we had had\nenough of the restaurant, we went\non to enjoy the nightlife at the\nUnion. Luckily we had a day to\nrecover before going to Wyeboston\nonce more. This time we had an\neven better time, getting covered in\nlayers of mud, followed by gravel\nand mud once again. A longer\nnumber of daylight hours and\nwarmer weather also helped.\nWelcome to the new Executive\nmembers for next year.\nThe Easter holidays saw the club\ntravelling further afield then usual'\nAnd most of the words of the songs\nwe played were known! Thanks\nIan, we love being woken up at\n8am, especially after going to sleep\nat 4am. Anyway, it was pretty lucky\nsince the weather was quite tropical\nand the wind and waves were good.\nAs well as windsurfing, we had a chance to speed sail on the beach.\nHow is it possible to get burnt in\nthis country, and in April? Oh well,\nmaybe we've all developed skin\ncancer now. Going to pubs, playing\ntwister (finally), clubbing and doing\ntourist y things such as visiting St\nMichael's Mount, were on the\nagenda. Sadly, due to our general\ndisruption of the neighbours, we\nwon't be able to go back to the\nholiday park. What a spectacular\ncrash on that go-kart Phil! No\nJames, you're not driving next year.\nNow it is time to thank Phil and\nSteve on behalf of everyone in the\nclub. Our money and interests could\nnot have been looked after better.\nWe've had a fantastic year largely\nthanks to you. I hope that was ego\nboosting enough, we couldn't inflate your heads too much.\nDespite this, we are going to do all\nthis and even more next year. We'll\nbe having friendly races against\nother universities. Also, our club Tshirt should be out. Hmmm... IC\nSharks!\nAnd now our last few words to\nyou, as you leave us the\nresponsibilities and step away from\nthe combat zone... 'BE LUCK A AY OK'\nJulia Willison\nSt Mary's Rugby Champs\nOn the 21st March St Mary's entered two teams in the National\nMedical Schools sevens tournament\nin Nottingham. Despite many\ninjuries and late withdrawals, it was\nfelt that we had a team capable of\nwinning the title for the third time\nin as many years.\nThroughout the tournament the A team played some of the best sevens\n1 have played or seen played by a Mary's team, and although some\nplayers lacked experience their\ndetermination and graft more than\ncompensated. We won through to\nthe final having played four games,\nscored 128 points and c once ede d only 4. One referee said after the\nquarter final when we beat\nLiverpool 40-0, that we played\nsome of the best student sevens he\nhad seen for a long time.\nThe final was against Cardiff,\nwho had also won through with\nease, and was played in nothing less\nthan storm conditions. Playing into\nthe wind in the first half, we\nc once ede d two early goals, but the\ncharacter of the team showed, and\nwe never let our heads drop or\nconfidence in our ability waver. We\nbegan the second half 12-6 down,\nhaving pulled back a late first half\ngoal, and scored twice in the second\nhalf to make the score 18-12 in our\nfavour. Cardiff never gave up and\nin the last play of the game, crossed\nour\" line to send the game into\nsudden death extra time. Having\nkicked out on the full from the\nrestart we were forced to defend at\nthe centre spot scrum. A maul\ndeveloped just inside the Cardiff\nhalf at which they infringed\nallowing the referee to award us a penalty and a chance to snatch\nvictory. This we did and gratefully\naccepted the cup for the third time\nin a row, which will now remain at\nSt Mary's for good.\nAfter such an excellent team\nperformance it seems cruel to single\nout any players, but I would like to\nmention two. Firstly Jon Walters,\nwho in my opinion was the player\nof the tournament; his strong\nrunning, particularly from\ndefensive positions, led to\nnumerous tries and gave the rest of\nus the chance for a quick breather.\nSecondly Stewart Berry, who\nstarted the day being dragged off the\nreplacement bench at 7.15 that\nmorning and finished it by kicking\na40 yard penalty into the wind to\nwin the tournament. It showed that\nto enter any rugby match or\ntournament without a kicker is mere\nsuicide.\nThe B team also played extremely\nwell, and after a shakey start went\non to lose in the semi-final of the\nbowl competition to the eventual\nwinners, Newcastle. My congratulations to them. Finally my\nthanks to the Medical Sickness\nSociety for once again organising an\nexcellent tournament, and we look\nforward to defending our title next\nyear.\nTeams A Team B McCormack Walsh\nLang ish Smith\nAbrams (c) Evans\nPoole Wright\nBerry Hamilton (c) Walters Porter\nBoos Helme\n\u201415\u2014\n\n"

The day will\nfeature a 'Celebrity Pram Race'\naround Prince's Gardens with\nbarrels of beer awarded for the\noutright winner; the most beautiful\ncelebrity baby and the most\ntechnologically advanced pram\ndesign. The prizes have been\nsponsored by IC Students' Union.\nAfter the 'Pram Prix' the Nursery\nwill be holding 'Barfly Jumping'\nbetween 6.00pm and 9.00pm. In clarification of last week's story headlined 'Financial\nConfusion' concerning ultra vire s payments. Silwood Park Students\nUnion did not pay \u00a350 to the\nSilwood Park Day Nursery, and the\nstory was never intended to mean\nthat. The article stated that Imperial\nCollege Union had instructed\nSilwood Students' Union not to\nmake the payment. We apologise\nfor any ambiguity in the wording.\nRCSU in trouble\nThe financial autonomy of\nImperial's Constituent College\nUnions (CCUs) is set to undergo a period of realignment following the\nrecent scare at Imperial College\nUnion over ultra vire s( out of rules)\npayments. ICU sources indicate that\nthe CCUs are believed to exercise\nfinancial irresponsibility, and that\ntheir apparent and alleged\nrecklessness could leave the parent\nIC Union liable on a charge of ultra\nvire s payments.\nThe suggestions of plans to\nincrease the financial accountability\nof CC Us to ICU follows\nprecautionary moves taken by Ken\nBignell, the Senior Treasurer of the\nRoyal College of Science C CU( RCSU). Mr Bignell this week\ninformed IC Union trading outlets\nthat the RCSU was to be accorded\na zero credit rating, which\neffectively means that all official\nR CSU orders had to be\naccompanied by cash payment\nbefore they could be fulfilled.\nIt is reported that Mr Bignell is\nrefusing to sign any further cheques\nuntil financial procedures within the\nRCSU have been considerably\ntightened. RCSU sources have\nreacted furiously to the rumours that\nswept the college that the RCSU\nwas on the verge of bankruptcy.\nRCSU President, Angie Creissen,\nsaid that the Senior Treasurer's move was due to 'general office\nincompetence.' Speaking to i CNN, Miss Creissen said that 'the kick up\nthe arse approach' had not worked,\nand that 'maybe the Armageddon\napproach will.'\nOther sources say that the RCSU\ncould not be bankrupt as they are\nreported to have considerable cash\nreserves. The administration of\nImperial College have indicated to\nImperial College Union that union\ncash reserves will have to be\nsignificantly reduced over the\nimmediate future. The extent of the\nhardening line of college was\nindicated by the report given to ICU\nCouncil on Monday by ICU Deputy\nPresident, Jonathan Griffiths. Mr Griffiths, who is responsible for\nICU finances, wrote of 'ironing out\nfinancial regulations which college\nare asking for.'\nThe degree of financial autonomy\nof the constituent college unions is\nat best a nebulous concept. While\nthe CCUs argue that they are\ncompletely autonomous financially\nfrom ICU, the college union says\nthat as they pay out C CU grants,\nthen they could be held responsible\nfor any illegal spending on the part\nof the CCUs.\nUnion sources have indicated that\nthe expenditure of grant money on\ncomplementary C CU ball tickets is\nultra vire s. The money is used to\nAn inmate of IC Nursery at play on Thursday\npay for the cost of each C CU sending complementary tickets,\nsome of which go to other C CU senior officers. A financial opinion\nsought by (CNN indicates that this\npayment is regarded as 'sub sidi sing food and drink.' It is then a matter\nof debate as to whether this\nconstitutes an ultra vire s payment.\nOur source informs us that while\nsub sidi sing food and drink for\nfresher's events is regarded as a legal payment, the sub sidi sing of\nsubsequent 'food and drink' events\nis ultra vire s because they are not\nprimarily aimed at bring fresher s together for educational and social\nbenefit. This construction is not\nimmediately apparent from the\nletter of guidance issued by the\nAttorney General's office on the\nmatter in 1983, and referred to in\nlast week's Felix. A second\nfinancial expert contacted by /CNN\nhas indicated that the sub sidi sing of\nthe C CU complementary tickets\ncontinued on back page\nArt Fire\nA serious fire broke out on the\nfourth floor of the Royal College of\nArt (RCA) on Kensington Gore\nyesterday (Thursday). The fire\noccured in a workshop in the silver\nand jewellery department and\nnecessitated an evacuation of the\nRCA. "

    "content": "Clubs & Societies Felix 934 15 May 1992\nThe IC First Eight travelled to\nJapan last week, courtesy of Fuji\nTV, in order to compete at the third\n'Henley Regatta in Japan'. After a day spent meticulously preparing a borrowed boat at the Toda Olympic\nrowing course and assessing the\nopposition, the crew transferred to\nthe Sumida River in the centre of\nTokyo.\nThe regatta comprised of four\nsemi-finals, with the winners\nprogressing to the final. IC were\ndrawn against a powerful crew from\nthe University of California, Los\nAngeles and two local Japanese\nuniversities. The Americans had\nfive international oarsmen on\nboard, one of which had competed\nin the 1988 Olympics.\nRowing against a strong wind and\ntide, IC convincingly earned a place\nin the final. However, the\nUniversity of Bristol qualified in\ntheir semi-final recording a faster\ntime. Waseda University, from\nJapan, also made the final yet again.\nThen the tide turned, against the\nwind, whipping up huge waves that\npropagated down the river,\nrebounding off the concrete walls\n- true sinking conditions for these\nfrail, lightweight craft. The IC\ncrew, weighing in 71 kg heavier in\ntotal than their nearest rivals, Nihon\nUniversity, then realised how small\ntheir boat was, but arrived at the\nstart determined to win.\nIn the final, IC went off to a good\nstart and, despite ploughing through\nthe waves rather than riding over\nthem, were five lengths up on\nBristol after only two minutes.\nNihon, however, were much faster\nand were using their advantageous\nlane to good ett ect. The crews battled alongside past\nthe largely partisan crowd, while aTV helicopter followed overhead;\nIC would edge ahead and then be\nimpeded by a massive, drenching\nwave. Bristol were found wanting\nin these appalling conditions and\neventually stopped before\nembarrassingly going ashore.\nMeanwhile IC, with the aid of\njudicious steering, pushed on and\ncrossed the line three-quarters of a length ahead of Nihon, who\npromptly sank at the finish. IC\nbaled out the water from their boat\ncontinuously as they crept slowly\nback to the landing stage, receiving\nrapturous applause from the crowd.\nThe whole race had been\nspectacularly televised, with\noverhead and close-up shots that put\nthe BBC to shame! The crews\nbe proud of the diplomacy and\ngoodwill shown by its oarsman\nacross the world.\nCarl Boon (Physics 3)\nflooding rivers - all in pouring rain\n- it was slightly disappointing to\ndiscover that the actual route\ninvolved nothing more than a leisurely, if not entirely scenic,\nstroll along a main road.\nIn true I CUY HA tradition spirits\nwere soon raised again though, with\nDramboie salutes all round (and all\nup the walls in some cases). Then,\nafter a final tipple of that magic\ntre ac ly brew, we set off for home.\nImperialism in Japan\nwatched the replay with pride. Any\ncrew surviving those conditions\ndeserved to win, but of course, IC\nhad retained their title.\nAfter the traditional exchanging\nof kit, the crews attended the\npresentation and reception before\nembarking on a night of celebration.\nBefore leaving Japan, the visiting\nteams were given a day-long tour\nof the city, culminating in an\nevening at the Tokyo Disneyland.\nThe whole trip was an\nunforgettable experience. The\nperiod of fame and stardom may\nhave been brief, but the reputation\nof the Boat Club is truly\ninternational. Imperial College can\nr ish Walking Excursion\nI CUY HA broke the tradition of\nheading to Scotland for the Easter\ntour this year and, in an inspired\nand popular move, set sail for the\nEmerald Isle instead.\nThe choice of Killarney as our\nbase for the trip was a good one.\nThe town itself was full of placards\nextolling the virtues of Guinness\nand, perhaps even more\nimportantly, there was an\nabundance of wonderful walking\ncountry within easy reach of our\ncamp-site. (We are after all a walking club and not a drinking\nclub; although occasionally\nconfusion on the issue is quite\nunderstandable...)\nDespite the astonishingly\nunpredictable weather, most people\nventured out on most days to\ndiscover the joys of the diverse Irish\ncountryside. On one of the two icy\nmornings though, even the prospect\nof a pleasant days walk with\nexcellent scenery and jovial\ncompany wasn't enough to lure\neveryone out of their tents. Hearty,\nif not entirely harmonious\nrenditions of Dubliners songs,\ntogether with threats of cold\nporridge in the sleeping bag usually\ndid the trick however.\nDuring the week there were\nstrolls around the picturesque lakes\nof Killarney, walks across the\nbleak, heather y hills of the\nMuckross Estate national park and\ndays spent sampling the rugged and\nvery spectacular coastal scenery.\nOn one particular coastal walk we\nwere accompanied by a travelling\nmusician (Irish rover) who played\nthe mandolin and wore a ring of\nbells around his ankle. As clich ed as it seemed, we all agreed that this\nwas the type of thing that could only\nhappen in Ireland. Having taught us\nseveral new Irish folk tunes, our\nwandering minstrel friend then\nintroduced us to one of the locals\n- the Dingle Bay dolphin. Perhaps\non advice from his more famous\nEnglish counterpart, the dolphin\nwas decidedly cautious when two\nmomentarily mad walkers dived\ninto the freezing water to swim with\nhim. He had no objections to photos\nbeing taken though, and between us\nwe now have a collection of twenty\nor more identically uninteresting\nshots showing the tip of a small grey\nfin in a vast grey expanse of water.\nMuch more spectacular was the\ngreatly anticipated 'Mac\nGillicuddys Reeks' range. This\nnotorious series of high serrated\nridges was conquered on the second\nlast day by a brave party of four (ie\nall those who did not have\nhangovers). The walk commenced\nat Kate Kearneys Cottage by the\nGap of Dunloe and followed the\nroute across the Reeks to Lough\nAcoose, taking in Ireland's highest\npeak - Carrantoohill (3414ft) on\nthe way. Even though it snowed and\nwas misty for part of the way, the\nwalk was unanimously voted as the\nbest in Ireland; quite an accolade\ngiven the quality of the competition.\nAfter the 'near death experience'\nof the Reeks, there was a mildly\nembarrassing incident the following\nday when a group of seven managed\nto get completely and utterly lost on\n'The Kerry Way'. After trudging\nfor hours through fields thick with\ngorse, circumnavigating huge pine\nplantations and wading through\n2nd Eight Success\nThe IC Boat Club's second eight\nfollowed the success of its first eight\nfrom five days earlier with a win in\nthe Senior B and Elite eights at\nTrinity College Regatta, Dublin this\nweekend. Despite not being pushed\nin either event over the two days,\nthey succeeded in becoming only\nthe second crew ever to break five\nminutes over the 1800m course.\nThe crew was summed up by the\nIrish Tribune as a 'model of\nstreamlined power', and according\nto the Independent, 'represented\none of the strongest overseas entries\nin recent years'.\nAll this from only a second eight!\nTENNIS CLUB\nMEMBERSHIP\nStudent membership costs \u00a3 6 . 0 0\nand can be obtained from Cathy or\nMichelle in the Union Office.

    "content": "15 May 1992 Felix 934 Opinion\nand their response ranged from\npatronising to insulting to childish\nto personal. A poor reflection on\ntheir own maturity.\nI mention a dangerous precedent,\nbecause Penguin wasn't the only\none to suggest new job descriptions.\nUnion president, Zoe Hellinger,\ntabled a motion to amend the\ncurrent job descriptions of the\nsabbaticals. And you thought they\ndidn't have one? The main change\nwas outlined in Zoe's report. Tn\nresponse to a member of Council\nthe office sabbaticals have now\nstarted filling in time sheets, as we\nare accountable to students any\nstudents who wish to see these\nsheets can look at them in my\noffice.'\nThis ignores three important\nconsiderations. Firstly, students\nwill not know to check time sheets\nbecause they at this stage are\nunaware of their existence.\nSecondly, filling time sheets does\nnot guarantee in itself that\nconstructive work is being done by\nsabbaticals, though there is no\nreason to doubt that this does not\nhappen anyway. They do, after all,\nget along. Thirdly, this decision\nwas reached without consultation\nwith students. It may not be\nimportant enough to justify a college wide ballot, but with\ngovernment reform of student\nunions a racing certainty, then any\nsuggestion of an undemocratic\nstructure will lead to disaster for the\nunion.\nThis opens up a very serious\nquestion. How accountable are our\nunion sabbaticals and officers? This\nis of critical importance. Those\namong the rabid right in\nConservative Students are pushing\nvery hard indeed for wholesale\nreform of student unions. One of\nthe national officers of Conservative\nStudents told me last Friday that in\nthe same way that the government\nreformed trade unions in the 1980s, then so student unions would be\nreformed in the 1990s. The end\ncould well be nigh for student\nunions as we know them.\nTheoretically, the procedures to\nhold Union sabbaticals accountable\nfor their actions is in place. The\nenigma is in implementing these\nprocedures. Zoe's escape from\nbeing tarred with the brush of\nStalinism in the Independent (6\nFebruary this year), suggests that\nthe precedents are not good.\nThis is a problem which Zoe is\ntaking seriously, indeed\ncourageously so. Her solution is to\nproduce a promotional brochure to\nsell the main benefits of Imperial\nCollege Union. So, when voluntary\nmembership is introduced, and I mean when, then the former ICU\nmembers will know what they're\nmissing, and sign up in droves. It\nis nice to see an important piece of\nforward planning. But look over\nyour shoulder a bit. Why do we\nhave the Union Handbook, and how\ntenable is its future if the new glossy\nbrochure is introduced?\nGiven that most in Imperial\nCollege Union regard the National\nUnion of Students as an\nembarrassing anachronism, and that\nthe groundswell in favour of forcing\nreform in the national union is ever\nincreasing in London, would it be\nan idea for Imperial to blaze a trail\nand introduce voluntary\nmembership on its own, to see how\nit works? It's a possible way of\nputting the Union to the test of fire,\nand may provoke much greater\nreform in the NUS than setting up\na rival union, an idea that is gaining\ncurrency in the London School of\nEconomics.\nThe imminent threat of imposed\ngovernment reform hung heavily\nover this particular council meeting.\nA whiff of possible financial\nregulation came from the Deputy\nPresident, Jonathan Griffiths. Apart\nfrom a possible surprise increase in\nUnion funding this year, he\nannounced that a Union Finance\nCommittee (UFC) meeting would\nbe held on Thursday 28 May. The\npurpose of the meeting is ' fo iron\nout a set of financial regulations\nwhich the college are asking for...\nshow the lines of responsibility as\nwell as other codes of practice.'\nGiven the recent scare over ultra\nvire s( out of rules) payments, and\na hardening ICU line against what\nthey perceive to be alleged financial\nirresponsibility of the part of\nconstituent college unions (CCUs),\nthen this UFC could be an\nespecially bruising encounter. It\nmay also finally and firmly define\nthe exact revised financial status and\nrelative accountability of CCUs and\nICU. Could it lead to a permanent\nerosion of the so-called financial\nautonomy of the CCUs? Watch this\nspace.\nIf you want to find out what\nhappened at Monday's council\nthrough the official channels, don't hold your breath, or your water.\n. if sabbaticals\nwish to disown\nor not be\ninvolved in the\nwork of Major\nSubcommittees\nthen I, for one,\nwould be happy\nto remove them\nfrom our\nconstitution... \u2022\nThe minutes won't be published\nuntil just before the next council,\nthrough no-one's fault. Things have\nalways been done this way. Though\ntheoretically you are able to inspect\nthe minutes, when was the last time\nyou were told this? Be original. Try\nasking for them. The new buzz\nword is accountability.\n\u2014 1 7 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "15 May 1992 Felix 934 Editorial\neditor i a The increasing regularity of\nsneezing and snuffling around the\noffice ordains the onset of summer.\nThe grass is procreating, the\npigeons are coo-cooing, the Beit\nduck is back in the quad (and living\nin a gorse bush). Ah, springtime;\nwhen a young man turns lightly to\nthoughts of summer examinations.\nIn fact the onset of decent weather,\neven if it be only for a short period,\nhas mellowed me to such an extent\nthat I find it well nigh impossible\nto rant about anything - just to\npractice my lizard impression on the\ngrass of Beit Quad.\nThe Union Council last Monday\nwas worrying. Not that it was any\nmore worrying than previous ones\n- the lack of interest displayed on\nthe part of Union members and the\naggression' displayed by some\nsabbaticals towards difficult\nquestioners is rapidly becoming the\nnorm. I have a tendency to keep\nquiet during these meetings\nbecause, apart from an intense\ndislike of anything approaching\npublic speaking, anything I say has\nbeen treated in the past as the\nw hinge ing of a troublemaker.\nWhich may well be true - it happens\nto be my job. Penguin (Marc Ellis),\nthe Rag Chair, tried to bring some\ndebate to the meeting but was put\ndown ag gres iv ely by the acting\nchair who seemed more eager to\nbring the meeting to an early close\nrather than for Council to debate the\nissues.\nWithin the next few years it is\nvery likely that the Conservative\ngovernment will succeed in\nbreaking up the National Union of\nStudents through the introduction of\nvoluntary membership - I have\nalready explained in previous\neditorials what this will entail. The\nlack of interest and participation in\nCouncil this week, and in the EG M last week, is indicative that IC\nUnion will either cease to exist or\ncontinue in a much reduced form\nwhen this legislation goes through.\nThe problem may be that few\nstudents around college realise the\nbenefits offered by the Union and\ntake its facilities for granted.\nWithout a Union grant there\nwould be no Felix or IC Radiomany people would say this was no\ngreat loss, but closely followed by\nthese closures would be the massive\nreduction in the travel subsidies to\nthe Athletic and Recreational Clubs,\nforcing fees to increase and the\nnumber of teams and events to be\nreduced. The Welfare service\noffered by the Union would stop,\nstudent representation on college\ncommittees would stop and without\nthis the students would have even\nless control or knowledge of\nac como dati on changes or anything\nThe things people do for money.\nLast Sunday thirteen people flung themselves from a150ft crane in Derby\nto raise money for UNICEF through ICU Rag. More information is given\noverleaf. This is a picture of Steve Newhouse, ICU SCC Chair, Duty\nOfficer, Collating Machine Tamer, Felix\nContributor and Bureaucrat\nExtraordinaire looking forward\nto the next Union\nCouncil meeting.\nII\nHalf Colours\nTim Atkinson\nBecky Cotton\nThe following people have been awarded Scott Creed\nsocial colours by the City and Guilds Ian Dalley\nCollege Union. Certificates will be available Nishe Dighe\nfrom the Guilds Office on Monday. Colours Anita Ellis\nties and tacks may be purchased from the Clare Embling\noffice at any time on production of the Christian Enderby\nrelevant certificate.

The CCUs are funded by\nICU and if the grant that ICU has\nto distribute is reduced, then the\namount given to the CCUs would\nalso reduce. Probably to the point\nwhere the only role they could\nfulfill around college would be that\nof representation as they would no\nlonger have the funds to support\ntheir own clubs or sport teams.\nCredits\nRose, Andy T, Declan, Davids\nHB and S, Simon, James, Poddy,\nMario, Catherine, Boris, Sam,\nJonty, Stef, John, Bee, Scott,\nToby, Steves F and N, Marge,\nIan, Khurrum, Chantelle Ward,\nHarry Lock, Troy Tempest and\nYinch, the Raggies, the flying\nwater carrier and the skilful and\nelegant centaur.\nHon Sec Bit\nWhat a busy week our lovely Rag\npeople are having. Hypnosis\nalready done and lots more to come.\nThe prospect of bopping to Abba\nand 70s music is a must for any self-respecting student (except for the\nclothes). So get on down to the\nLounge tonight. Rumours that\nJonathan has lots of spare outfits for\ntonight are greatly exaggerated.\n(Although he's definitely old\nenough). Then it's pig-frying and\nfun time tomorrow at the Rag Fete.\nDefinitely the Rag event of term and\nbetter than looking at the bread in\nSainbury's on a Saturday.\nMost Extraordinary Meetings\nEGMs and General Meetings do\nexist for a purpose. They're for\npolicy decisions, quizzing\nsabbaticals and other officers and\nhaving a say in how the Union\nworks. The last EG M was a mess\nbecause a) I couldn't get a PA and\nb) nobody turned up. So if you\ncame you could have questioned\nwhy I had no PA, even if you\nwouldn't have heard the answers!\nHowever there is an EG M on\nThursday 28 May in the JCR at\nl pm. If you want to vote for next\nyear's House Committee Chair or\nvarious other posts then turn up.\nThird World First have their motion\nre-submitted and any further\nmotions should be handed in at the\nUnion Office by 12.30pm next\nThursday.\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews Felix 934 15 May 1992\nMemoirs of an Invisible Man\nDoes anyone out there remember\nthose old, unrealistic, terrifying\n(well, maybe for an eight year old)\nepisodes of the Invisible Man on the\ntelly? You know, the ones that used\nthe same invisibility gags (about\ntwo of them) throughout every\nseries, and that the above mentioned\nman walked around covered in\nmake-up all the time? Yes, well you\nmay just find this rendition mildly\nentertaining, certainly not\nunder pant soiling material.\nThe film stars Chevy Chase and\nNick Halloway, a stock analyst who\nis introduced one night to Alice\n(Daryl Hannah), sparks fly, hot and\nsteamy they get\u2014well, about\nenough to reduce their purity test\nscores by about one per cent (this\nis a PG you know)\u2014and they agree\nto meet later that week.\nThe next morning Nick attends a presentation at Magnascopic\nResearch Laboratories. He finds the\nlecture about subatomic particles,\nand magnetic flux, (surprisingly)\nboring. He goes for a nice relaxing\nsauna\u2014in his suit. On the way he\ncauses a technician to set off a cyclotron, triggering an alarm and\nevacuating the building. Nick\nsleeping serenely in the sauna is\nob li vous. On awakening Nick is\nastonished to notice that portions of\nthe building around him have\ndisappeared and even worse so has\nhe!\nOn the scene at that moment is\nDavid Jenkins (Sam Neill), a crafty\nCIA operative, who having\ndiscovered what happened to Nick,\nrealises he has something invaluable\non his hands and moves to capture\nhis ephemeral (I like that word)\nprey, and so begins the chasing and\nrunning.\nI really did expect a funnier\nscript, there are bouts of humour\nbut Chevy Chase has been in far,\nfar funnier roles. Daryl Hannah is\nso wooden in her role as to almost\ntake on tree-like dimensions and\nSam Neill is about as unnerving as\nEdd the Duck coming at you with\na rolled up copy of 'Fishing for Fun\nWeekly' (i.e. not very).\nThe films' only saving grace are\nthe j ubbe rly special FX, done by the\nsame team as T2 etc. In fact when\nit rains Chevy Chase almost look es like the T1000!\nEverything about this film says\nmild, and the fact that we\nsometimes see the man and other\ntimes not, may well be necessary it\nis often distorting. In fact, if asked\nwhether to meet this film or the man\nwho cleans the toilets, I'd go for\nWee Jimmy Poo Pong McPlop...\nevery time.\nPoo.\nScorchers\nI'm in two minds about this film.\nStrange, because it seemed like two\ndifferent films.\nThe first, a sort of sentimental\nand supposedly heart-wrenching T miss my Mom' effort is so\nc ring able, so wincing I feel its\nhardly worth a mention.\nDolan (father), Splendid\n(daughter) and Jumper (husband of\nSplendid, married for a few hours)\nplay out a wedding night scene that\nis hard to imagine. Their names are\nrather apt, except perhaps Dolan,\nwho should be Dylan. It all begins\nwell enough, but the ending!\nSplendid pretends to be her mother,\nwho died giving birth to her, to ask\nfor her approval. Confused? Don't bother.\nIn another film, taking place in\nanother part of town, a far better\nscene is being acted out. A drunk,\na barman, a whore and a wife, who\nthe whore is sleeping with try their\nhands at solving a few of life's problems, including why people\nlike classical music. It may sound\ncorny but has a feeling of been\nthere, tried that, we didn't get any\nanswers either.\nThe best performances are by\nthose in the bar, Denholm Elliot as\nHowler (the drunk) and James Earl\nJones as Bear (the barman) shines\nlike the a star in the pitch black sky.\nIndeed, a better film could have\nbeen based around the bar, with a few incidental characters wandering\never so often.\nOverall this film seems to lack\nsomething. Despite attempts to pull\nthe two parts of the film together\n(the Preacher is late for the wedding\nof Splendid, and Jumper because\nhe's having sex with the whore),\nthere is no real ending. My best\nmemory of the film is probably the\nlaughs of the audience when Bear\nasks Howler why he left the theatre.\nIf you want my advice (and if not\nwhy are you reading this?), wait for\nthis to move to the cheaper cinemas,\nor even video.\nPebbles\n\u2022 Scorchers opens at the Odean,\nHaymarket, today,\n(check that Mario)\nYep, sure does Peb.\nBad Blood\nThe third and last play from quite\na long way away produced by the\nGate Teatre in its Beyond-Europe\nseason is Bad Blood by the\ncontemporary Argentinian\nplaywright Griselda Gambaro. The\nplay deals with macho is m and\nviolence. The Father, a governor,\noppresses his wife and daughter\nDolores and everybody else around\nhim. His marriage arrangements for\nDolores seem jeopardized,\nhowever, as she falls in love with\nher hunchbacked house teacher. They plan to escape from \"this\nsavage town, where the best heads\nend up in barrels and the best sound\nis silence.\"\nThe most gripping scene is when\nDolores stands up against her father\nfor the first time, but most of the\ntime the play is too predictable. I thought Dolores' love for her\nteacher came a bit quick and wasn't very convincing. Also, I found the\nimage of the hunchback as the only\nstraight person a bit tired. And why\nis the tea served in tin cups in the\nhouse of the gou ern or? I'm not so\nsure of and the production is a bit\nwish y was hy( except for the stage\nset, which is very good).\nBoris\n\u2022 Bad Blood, until May 30 every\nMo-Sat at 7.30pm at the Gate\nTheatre. 11 Pembridge Rd, Notting\nHill.
