As well as the two major productions each year, we keep busy with musical reviews and a weekend workshop, the latter held at the beginning of term (14th16 th October). This year it will be based on The\nScarlet Pimpernel.\nSo if you feel the need to let your singing\nand acting skills develop in a very sociable,\nfriendly atmosphere, then please visit us at\nthe fresher s' fair, where we will be pleased to\nsee you.\nPlease note, copious amounts of alcohol\nare consumed to lubricate vocal chords!!\nContact:\nJohn Savery (chairman)\nLaurie Tweedale (vice-chair)\nindustrial society The ICIS is a society that aims to give all students an insight into major companies in\nindustry.

This applies as much to 1st and 2nd years as to finalists. Our weekly presentations are an incalculable way for our\nmembers to meet student recruitment officers. Practically speaking, this means that you\ncan chat over a glass of wine with the person\nwho will interview you for a job with their\ncompany.\nWhen we're not going out to visit companies, then they come to us. Several times a term, we will organise a business game where\na company will come in, and teach us about\nit's area of business, usually through a game\nfor enjoyment.\nThese events are great fun, and an excellent place to make friends with other stu-dents, and contacts in the world of business.\nAnd, as an enticement for you to come along,\nwe generally provide some food and drink for\nthe break, where, you're free to talk to any-one, and ask questions.\nSo, look out for us at The Fresher's Fairwe're located in the Main Dining Hall\n(MDH), in the Sherfield building.

    "content": "TWO . FELIX SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 30TH1995 NEWS\nLast minute touches: ICU Entertainments Manager Mark Home\nfinished re-decorating the Ents lounge yesterday in preparation for\nFreshers' Week. Over the next few days eight bands, a hypnotist and\na top TV comedy act will be appearing at six events. \"It's our first\nchance of the year to prove that not all three years at IC are about\nengineering,\" he said.\ncontinued from page 1\nnot considering the simpler and\nmuch cheaper option of expanding and refurbishing the union in\nit's present Beit position. When\nthe biology department moves in\n1998, ICU could expand into the\nempty space relatively easily,\nwhilst still leaving room for considerable expansion of the residential area.\nIan Caldwell was on leave as\nFelix went to press, but Nick\nBlack, Estates Manager, insisted\nthat ICU would not be pushed\ninto a scheme that they weren't happy with. \"The Rector told\nLucy [last year's ICU President]\nthat he would make the new\nunion building an offer too good\nto refuse... as I understand it,\nthat situation remains,\" he said.\nBlack also dismissed out of\nhand rumours that a dramatically\nshortened timescale was being\npushed ahead. There had been\nsuggestions that the Union could\nbe asked to vacate its present\npremises for temporary accommodation as soon as next sum-mer. \"Nothing is settled at all,\"\nhe insisted.\nSarah White insists that she\nwould strongly oppose a move\nbased on the current plans. She\nguaranteed that Imperial's students will be fully consulted\nbefore a final decision is made.\nShe emphasised: 'There will\nabsolutely definitely be a refer-end um' on the subject, insisting\nthat this is not a decision that any\none person could take.\nICU employees appear similarly resolute in their opposition\nto any forced removal from their\npresent location. One senior official suggested that there would\nbe sit in of staff if any pressure\nwas brought to bear on them to\nvacate the much loved Quad.\nNick Black insisted that any\nhesitancy in fully disclosing the\nestates department's plans was\nbecause they wanted to get the\nproposal 'just right' before it was\nfinally presented to the student\nbody. He said that they were\naware that it was likely to be a contentious issue, and wanted to\nmake sure that everybody concerned would 'get a good deal'\nbefore the plans were fully\nbrought out in the open.\nNews in brief\nClayponds Crime Wave\nResidents of Clayponds,\nImperial's Ealing accommodation\nestate, are expressing increasing\nconcern about the recent spate of\nburglaries. The complex has been\nbroken into eleven times in\nrecent months, with one female\nground floor resident being a victim three times. Matt Crompton\nICU Deputy President (Finance\nand Services) said that there was\na programme under way to\nreview Clayponds security.\n\"They will almost definitely be\nhaving passive IR detectors\ninstalled,\" he insisted. \"We're\ndeeply concerned and will be\npushing it through the appropriate channels,\" he said\nBiochem Honour\nProfessor J. Oliver Dolly,\nProfessor of Molecular Neurobiology in the Department of\nBiochemistry, has been awarded\nthe Henderson Medal by the\nCentre for Applied Microbiology\nand Research.\nThis prestigious award follows his Henderson Memorial\nLecture at the Centre late last\nyear. Past recipients of the\naward, which is always given to\nthose who have carried out eminent work in the Centre's field,\ninclude Sir Hans Kornberg and\nProf Luc Montagnier.\nBarrier Breakdown\nThe effectiveness of the Closed\nCircuit Television Camera net-work, which extends throughout\nthe Imperial College campus, has\nbeen called into question by\nrepeated acts of vandalism over\nthe Summer.\nThe parking barrier in Watts\nWay, which has its own dedicated camera, was ripped off just\nyards from the Southside\nSecurity Lodge.\nApparently with so many\ndifferent cameras in the Princes'\nGardens area - over ten at the\nlast count, it is, not possible to\nmonitor all of them at the one\ntime.\nConsoc Capers\nImperial College's Conservative Society have started off\nthe year in much the same way as\nthey finished the last, by causing\ncontroversy with their web\npages. Not content with be censored twice in the final term,\nthey once again look set to provoke the wrath of Imperial\nCollege Union with a defamatory\nattack on a well know public fig-ure.\nThis time the subject of\ntheir 'Off the Record' column is\nthe media, and in particular the\nwell worn idea of how the media\nmonitor politicians and their\nactivities, but how nobody regulates the journalists. Consoc go\nso far as naming Rupert\nMurdoch, the owner of the News\nInternational conglomeration, as\none who wields too much power.\nTheir have been no reports so far\nof legal action against either\nImperial College Union or the\nConservative Society in part icu Aero Manoeuvres\nThe outbreak of building projects\nwhich erupted across the college\ncampus during the Summer\nVacation has included the redevelopment of the Aeronautics\nDepartment's Prince Consort\nRoad entrance. This high cost\nscheme involved transforming\nthe previously dingy front into a brightly lit display reminiscent of\nthe Science Museum's Flight\nLab.\nThe decor, which strongly\nfeatures imitation rivets, is being\nquestioned as a waste of College\nmoney. The reason for the concern centres on the fact that the\ndoor is only open for ten hours a day between 8am and 6pm. The\nlack of security camera means\nthat the swipe reader allows\naccess only to security personnel\nin times of emergency, and\nforces Aeronautics students who\nwant to enter after hours to trek\nround through Chemical\nEngineering.\n\n"

FIFTEEN\nHockey Club Show their Colours\nPermission from your parents, passports in\nthe glove box, much os guilders, beer-up\nfor the annual dice with death that is the I.C. HOCKEY CLUB TOUR OF HOLLAND( or\nat least a small part of it)\nWith theses, coursework, and best of all\nres its finished, the 1995 tour kicked off via\nSainsbury's. The essential barbecue material\nof burgers, sausages and Mr Blobby ketchup\nwas purchased. All of which was ingeniously\npreserved in dry ice - not the only thing that\nwas nicked from the department, oh no]\nThen off to Southside to start the tour as we\nmeant to carry on.\nNot wanting to be too vain we decided\nthat to play some sport over the weekend,\nhad a marathon pool se sh. But members\nfound this far too tiring so we all headed for\nBugies Bar. The purveyor of nocturnal beer\nand erm, curry: rendered the first tour victim\ntoilet wards. Unluckily Dr Svengenson, the\nsaid victim, was not to find out the pleasures\nof a couple of lesbians in syrup figs and a be rk with a dead zebra for trousers.\nMorning found us crippled and facing the\npossibility of a day's travel. Our illustrious\nleader, Ms DICtator, had the presence of\nmind to arrange the tour on her birthday\nweekend. Lured through the wilds of Suffolk\nen route to Felixtowe, the promise of coffee\nand bacon s arnie s was but a cunning plan for\nDICtator to go home and get her b 'day pre-sent s. To make up numbers the men'sX decided to kidnap a helpful local.\nWe arrived at port with the customary\nfive minutes to go and ensconced ourselves\noutside the duty free shop. A couple of bottles of Pimms and two thousand tabs later, a quiet Belgian couple in the corner decided to\n\"... the pleasures of a couple\nof lesbians in syrup figs and\na be rk with a dead zebra for\ntrousers.\nleave the room - obviously we were having\ntoo much fun.\nSix hours later, having escaped the\nZeebrugge traffic the ladies VII found a IXth\nand we headed for Terneuzen Hockey Clubour unwitting tournament hosts for the\nweekend. With opening time approaching we\nused The Force to guide us toward a supplier\nof fine ales. Unfortunately The Dark Side was\nstrong and all we could find was shitty Dutch\nlager. Later we headed bar wards to meet up\nwith the Old Boys XI, where we stayed for\nthe duration of the evening - to mentally prepare ourselves for the following morning's hockey.\nA nine o 'clock start caused few problems,\nwell for the Dutch sides anyway. We were\nthere in spirit alone. This could explain the\nday's results. By evening we realised that we\nwere far superior to every team there, but\nhey it was just that their pitches resembled a... the Dutch, being so wet\nalready, retired to their\nwindmills to put some\nchickens in some bowls.\"\ncabbage patch. We was robbed!\nTime for yet another barbie, this time a la\nDutch. Not quite up to the standard we were\nused to, we suffered in silence - the English\nway - and chowed down. It was, quite\nfrankly, pissing it down and the Dutch, being\nso wet already, retired to their windmills to\nput some chickens in some bowls. Being only\ntwo deep at the bar now, we took advantage\nof the situation.\nTo pay for beer, one first had to buy\ntokens, which could the be exchanged for the\nbev vy of your choice: Eurofizz or Eurofizz.\nBeing the green minded people we are, it\nseemed ecologically sound to recycle these\ntickets from the bin at the back of the bar.\nNot only did this save valuable Brazilian rain\nforests, but also saved us paying. RESULT!\nThree hundred free beers and a few tulips\nlater, two of our number were in casualty,\nreturning with sixteen stitches between\nthem, four of which were in Darrell Jnr's left\nbuttock. Meanwhile Darrell Snr was\nattempting to play hide the sausage with an\nold boy on a bar stool. A fun evening all\nround.\nSunday's hockey fared little better.\nChampagne hockey and silky skills were useless in the face of Dutch umpires. At this\npoint it became apparent that Squashy was\nnot feeling on top form. After ten minutes\nplay he retired to his sleeping bag, where he\nremained until admitted to intensive care.\nThe rest of us piled down to a local\nrestaurant for the traditional feast of steak\nand mussels. Certain members of the party\nhowever, thought that the paraffin from the\ntable candles was somewhat more app et ising, but then found that they couldn't taste anything else. After clearing out the restaurant,\nwe left. Returning to the camp where we finished our remaining supplies.\nWhen morning came the group was down\nto its last five cigarettes and decided to make\nhaste to the ferry before we ran dry. Collecting Squashy from the hospital and grappling\nwith Belgian road signs we managed to arrive\nsomewhat earlier - ten minutes before de par ture, but since the lads had lost their ticket\nwe ended up being equally late.\nWe were now in a mood for relaxation\nafter a hard weekend's touring. However\nPoncho our token-rugby-player-make-up-the-numbers-type-hanger-one r had other\nideas. Making full use of his allowance he\nacquired a bottle of Bell's. After cordially\noffering it round - you know to keep out the\ncold - he necked half a bottle and proceeded\nto wreck the ship. His companion in drink,\nIC Reject, finished the remaining quarter,\npassed out in a corner and woke up with one\neyebrow too few. Meanwhile Poncho had\nsummarily thrown his breakfast to the waves,\ninsulted a biker, and passed out in the\nrestaurant. He woke up to find a razor and an\naccusation by his side. Even back on dear\nBlighty we were still not safe...\nPulling up at a garage for petrol we were\n\"Three hundred free beers\nand a few tulips later, two of\nour number were in casualty\nsurrounded by the a fore mentioned biker and\nhis Underworld cherubic cohorts. Fearing for\nour good looks and teeth, they approached\nand brutally told us they were writing a letter\nof complaint to Imperial College Union - less\nHell's Angels more Surrey's Solicitors. We\nscarp ered to the nearest drive through\nMcD's. During the long drive back to the Smoke,\nDarrell Jnr. had more bottom trouble and\nhad to lie on her front all the way to Guy'sA&E. Finally it was back to Southside to finish as we had started off, and a chance for\nPoncho to detoxify on a Basic's Pizza.\nBY THE HOCKEY CLUB\n\n"

Tutoring is very varied, and\ncertainly never boring! You may be involved\nwith teaching children from five to sixteen, as\npart of the whole class with the teacher or in\nsmall groups on your own.\nThe experience is rewarding, fun and\nchallenges and improves communication\nskills. Try explaining concepts that you take\nfor granted, e.g. friction or pressure, in a way\nwhich pupils, of say eight years old, could\nrelate to and understand.\nIt can be quite daunting the first time\nthat you go into the classroom, with thirty\nfaces staring at you inquisitively. However,\nthe children always make you very welcome.\nSome tutors worry that they may not be\nable to answer the questions that the children\nask, but the teachers are always present to\nhelp. Pupils do have a way of asking difficult\nquestions that you can't or won't like to try\nand answer. One afternoon a twelve year old\nasked me out of the blue \"How could the\nVirgin Mary be a virgin if she had a baby?\"\nHow do you begin to answer that one?\nTutors can act as role models to the\npupils that they teach. It hopefully presents\nHigher Education as an option for their\nfuture. Female tutors can also provide a positive image of women scientists and engineers.\nAs tutors we hope to dispel the myth that science is difficult and boring.\nThe Pimlico Connection Society is run\nby a student committee which also organises\nopen days and social events.

FELIX SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 30TH1995 NEWS\nBasic Medical Sciences' on target' Imperial planners insist that they\ncan make the 1998 deadline for\nthe opening of the new Basic\nMedical and Biological Sciences\nbuilding.\nWith the government share\nof the funding only being finally\nconfirmed in July, IC has just\napplied for planning permission\nto build the centre.\nAccording to a newly\nrevised schedule, the final design\nstage of the project should be\ncompleted by March, which will\nleave just two years before the\nprojected completion date of\nEaster 1998. Rodney Eastwood,\nDirector of Planning, insists that\nthe scheme is on target. \"The\nopening date of September 1998\ncannot be moved. It's absolutely\nfixed.\"\nHowever, the Old Chemistry building due to be knocked\ndown to make way for the new\ndepartment is still standing.\nPlanners will submit applications\nfor demolition later this month,\nwhich means that the building is\nunlikely to come down until early\nnext year. Nick Black, Estates\nManager, said \"It means we're\nalready running behind schedule,\nwhich is really bad news.\"\nThe new building will eventually house St Mary's and\nCharing Cross Hospital Medical\nSchools, the National Heart and\nLung Institute and the Royal\nPostgraduate Medical School as\nwell as Imperial College's own\nbiology department.\nStudent union officers from\nSt Mary's are concerned that\nthey are not represented at the\nregular planning and design meetings for the building. Sarah\nWhite, Imperial College Union\nPresident, represents all the different student groups involved.\nIn addition, Sarah Edwards,\nSt Mary's Union President, is\nconcerned that students will not\nbe allocated adequate social and\ncatering facilities. The present\noutline design allows for only a very small capacity restaurant on\nthe ground floor. Mr Eastwood\nemphasised that the new centre\nwill be only thirty yards away\nfrom the Sherfield Building and\nthat the different groups of students would mix better if they\nshared the same social facilities.\nBoth the Reid and Pippard lecture theatres were completely refurbished this summer in preparation for the increased use that they\nwill receive this year. With the old chemistry building now out of\naction and awaiting demolition, first and second year lectures have\nhad to be re-allocated elsewhere. Previously the only regular usage\nof these lecture theatres was by the the biochemistry department.\nMore Halls for Prince Gardens New Health Centre Planned\nImperial College estates department have commissioned a feasibility study to refurbish and\nexpand the halls of residence in\nPrinces Gardens.\nOptions include building\nnew halls on the roof of the\nsports centre and on the site of\nthe tennis courts beside\nLinstead. The department also\nplans to completely refurbish the\nSouthside building.\nThe move comes as part of a plan to completely redevelop the\narea. Funding has already been\nconfirmed to move the health\ncentre from its present location\nto the Conference Office\npremises at the east end of\nSouthside. This 3\nA million project is being financed by the\nNational Health Service and\nNick Black, Estates manager,\nsays that they anticipate getting\nplanning consent soon.\nIn a further development\nover the summer, Imperial has\nbought the area of park north of\nPrinces Gardens. Although they\nare not allowed to build on the\nland, estates plan to extend the\nsports centre underground to\nprovide further facilities.\nThe sports centre itself was\ndesigned to have a hall of residence built on top of it, but a planning application submitted in\n1988 was not accepted, and\nattracted considerable opposition\nfrom local residents.\nNonetheless, estates intend to\nresubmit an application, with the\nhope of building student flats. A considerable increase in the number of bed spaces available is necessary to accommodate the medical students who will be based in\nSouth Kensington from 1998.\nNick Black maintains that IC\nis in a strong position to secure a large loans at a favourable rate of\ninterest to finance the proposals.\nEach bed in an IC hall of residence brings in around \u00a32000 a year from conference bookings,\nso the new halls could effectively\nfinance themselves, he insisted.\nHe maintained that' college\nwould endeavour to keep rents\naround the \u00a350 a week mark.\n\n"

Many members of the RCS exec say they are\nangry that the Kings mascot\nstolen in a 'rag raid' has been\nreturned without the customary\nmascot ry penance of a sizeable\ndonation to charity.\nThe return of the 6001b lion\nwas negotiated by ICU President\nSarah White and RCS President\nMo Dulloo when Kings College\nrepeatedly resisted demands calling for a ransom.

Made of cement, copper\nand bits of old vacuum cleaner\nand painted gloss red, the lion is\napparently of great sentimental\nvalue to the students' union.\n\"Words can't express how happy\nwe are to have him back,\" he\nsaid.\nWith the return of the lion\nbeing negotiated over the summer vacation, most of the RCS\nexec did not know that it was\ngoing back. Richard Willis, Rag\nChair, was angry and defiant:\n\"We need some compensation\nfor this. It's a bloody disgrace.\"\nHe warned KCL SU that as far as\nhe was concerned, the score was\nstill not settled. \"They've got to\ndo something for charity and\nthey've got to do it quick... It's not all over yet, but I suppose we\ncan finish it at a later stage.\"\nSpeaking to Felix, Willis rejected\nthe suggestion that the sport of\nmascot ry was sad, pointless and\nclearly destructive. \"Mascotry\npromotes lateral thinking and initiative amongst students,\" he\nclaimed.\nRob Hall insisted that\nKCL SU \"have withdrawn from\nmascot ry for the time being.\" He\nexplained that they are now planning to have the lion restored as\npart of a venture that will also see\nthe sculpting of a bust of\nDesmond Tutu for the Kings\nUnion bar. \"We're hoping for a clean, calm run into his rest or a tion,\" he said.\nYo xx Cou1 ci\nWIN a Round the World Ticket\nfrom Oxford University Press\nwhen you open a BlackwelPs Personal Account\nBlackwelPs\n100 Charing Cross Road,\nLondon WC2\nTel (0171) 292 5100\nFax (0171) 240 9665\nOpening Hours\nMonday-Saturday\n9.30am8.30 pm Sundays 12noon6.00 pm \u2022 The largest single floor\nbook selling area\nanywhere in the world\n\u2022 Over 50,000 academic\n& general titles stocked\n\u2022 Dedicated multimedia\nsection\nWe buy and sell\nSecondhand\nTextbooks\nBLACKWELL' S BOOKSHOPS For all your\nAcademic Books\nand General Reading\n\n"

I used\nto think it was just here, but I get\nthe feeling it's happening all over\nthe country. I think it's lack of job\nsecurity that makes everyone that\nway. If you've got a job, it should\nbe for life - these three year contracts are really bad.

FELIX SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 3 0 TH1995 HOME\nL instead Worries Alternative Union Proposal The Union of the University of London: UL U President, Ghassan Karian (left), and Imperial College\nUnion President, Sarah White, take a break from discussing future student funding policies.\nThe death of a Linstead fresher\nwas narrowly averted at the end\nof last term when people standing on the ground below managed to avert a suicide attempt.\nBoth the student's department and hall of residence welfare provisions have been called\ninto question, since it was widely known that the first year was\nunhappy and having problems.\nThe incident occurred on\nthe last Friday of the Summer\nterm. Although Linstead's Warden did have some success\nin calming the student as he was\nperched on his window sill,\nthe situation was apparently\nbrought to a head when the\npolice and fire authorities\nentered Watts Way with their\nsirens blazing.\nIt was only thanks to one of\nhis friends managing to stop his\nhead hitting the concrete below\nthat the Mechanical Engineering\nstudent avoided more serious\ninjuries than a broken pelvis.\nThe fresher involved is\nknown to have been drinking in\nthe Da Vinci's bar earlier that\nevening where he had exhibited\nsigns of distress. His outburst in\nthe Union was dealt with by\nstaff who treated a minor cut to\nhis head. He was left with\nfriends to be comforted, but\nsoon ran off to Linstead.\nWith the pressure of exams\nand the volume of work given to\nstudents being a contributory\nfactor, this incident once again\nquestions the pressure levels\nexerted by Imperial's various\ndepartments.\n\u2022 Another serious incident took\nplace on the final night of the\nSummer term. A guest of an\nImperial College student\nallegedly punched one of a group\nof rugby club friends. An affray\nresulted, in which blood was\nspilt, and claims were made that\n'the Army of Jah' would be\ninvolved in retribution.\nImperial College Union (ICU)\nPresident, Sarah White, is taking\npart in a new initiative to overturn a key policy of the National\nUnion of Students (NUS).\nGhassan Karian, the\nUniversity of London and former\nKings' College Union President is\nspearheading a campaign to come\nup with new ideas for higher education funding. The media\nfriendly Labour Councillor from\nEssex hopes to succeed where he\nfailed last year in the NUS\nExtraordinary General Meeting\nwhich was held in Derby.\nThat meeting narrowly rejected a motion to reverse the long\nstanding policy, which calls for\ngrants to be restored to 1979 lev-els. But Ghassan denies that this\n'New Solutions' campaign is simply a rerun of the previous battle.\nHe insists that there will be spin\noffs, for a 'whole range of educational issues'.\nThe ULU President believes\nthat the proposed change will\nbenefit students as the NUS\nwould, without their unrealistic\npolicy, be involved at the highest\nlevel of the educational debate.\nWhen pressed on this matter, he\ninsisted that Eric Forth, the\nGovernment's Higher Education\nMinister, was sympathetic to the\ncampaign.\nAccording to Mr Karian, the\ncurrent policy is completely\nimpractical and does absolutely\nnothing for students. It is 'pie in\nthe sky', where as he wants to see\n'food on the plate', metaphorically speaking.\nWith a steady build up from\na discussion document through a draft policy paper to a final policy document, Ghassan insists\nthat he is looking for a calm and\nrational debate. According to him\nthe Derby Meeting was marred\nby heated arguments which overshadowed any rational discussion.\nHis current calls for a debate of the issues rather than\nan emotional crusade runs somewhat counter the latest 'New\nSolutions' statements. They add\nto the charged atmosphere by\nforcefully attacking the NUS for\ntheir present policy.\nThey accuse the traditional\nmovement of being dominated\nby 'extremist left wing groups'\nwho 'stifle the debate on education funding'. New Solutions'\npapers further attack the NUS'\ncampaign for demonstrations and\noccupations with highly pejorative language.\nMr Karian, with his well documented 'New Labour' links,\ndenied that the matter was a party political issue. He insists\nthat he is ready to work with all\npolitical parties on the future of\neducation funding. With most of\nthe main political parties about to\ncommence their own policy\nreviews, the withdrawal of the\nNUS policy is seen as essential.\nThe ICU President insists\nthat she is only attending in a personal capacity; she asserts that\nshe will pay any affiliation fees\nherself. Sarah emphasises that\nshe would have to be 'utterly\nconvinced' that the proposed\nNew Solutions are going to work\nbefore proposing that ICU as a whole should affiliate.\nHaving the President of such\nan NUS sceptical college as\nImperial involved is being seen as\na coup for Mr Karian. He insists\nthat colleges like IC should be\npart of the debate as their students are just as affected by hardship as any others. He hopes to\nget Student Union officials from\nGlasgow and Edinburgh\nUniversities - both non NUS\ninstitutions - involved.\nThe present collection of\nover 100 student union officials\nfrom colleges as disparate as\nLondon, Scotland and Wales\nhope to eventually overcome the\n45 - 55% defeat at the last NUS\nconference and create a policy\nmore in tune with reality.\n\n"

FELIX SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 3 0 TH1995 SPORTS\nIC Rugby Club Storm Canada\nith last year's tour of Zimbabwe having\nproved such a success, IC Rugby\nFootball Club were itching to do some more\ntravelling. So, at the beginning of the spring\nterm, Canada was chosen as the destination\nand preparations began. The result was a two\nweek tour which was to include five games of\nrugby, an IC 'sports weekend' and two alumni events.\nCome the morning of Saturday 24th June\nthe months of anticipation were over and\nICRFC was off to Canada. Flying to\nVancouver on the west coast via Calgary,\ngave us our first glimpses of the Rocky\nMountains. After collecting our transport\n(four space cruiser vans) at the airport our\nfirst port of call was the University of British\nColumbia.\n\"the result was soon\nforgotten, thanks to\nhospitality of our hosts\"\nFollowing a morning training session to\nrun out the travel stiffness, the afternoon was\nspent relaxing on the beach and playing touch\nrugby in Stanley Park. Unfortunately, one or\ntwo had a shade too much sun and regretted\nit the next day in the game against Port\nAlberni Black Sheep on Vancouver Island.\nWe lost the match against Black Sheep\nnarrowly, 14-10, but the result was soon forgotten thanks to hospitality of our hosts.\nAlas, we had to wrench ourselves away from\nthe lakeside and continue on to Victoria, billeting at U VIC. In\nVictoria we came across\nour next opponents in\nthe form of Velox\nRugby Club. A superb\ndisplay saw us achieve a thoroughly deserved 24-0 victory which was\nample reason for a night\nof celebration.\nMoving out of\nVancouver we had a long day's drive before\narriving at Kelowna, the\nvenue of our next game\nagainst the Black Crows. Sweltering heat and\na lacklustre first half display meant that we\nwere really up against it, but a strong second\nhalf really earned us respect as well as points,\ndespite going down valiantly 29-17.\nOur aim over the next two days was to\ntravel some 800kms to Calgary, through the\nscenic Jasper and Banff Parks and to safely\nnavigate the rugged terrain of the Rocky\nMountains. Motel accommodation was\nsecured in Jasper, a town whose inhabitants\ncould quite easily have been the cast of\nNorthern Exposure.\nOur entry into Calgary at night was heralded by a fearsome electrical storm accompanied by driving rain. A visit to Calgary's Olympic sites was the first item on the agenda for the next day. The team experienced\nthe thrill of a bob sleigh run and ski jump\nwith out imperiling their lives - with the aid\nof a simulator.\nThe Kannucks provided stern opposition\nin the afternoon's match and we succumbed\n28-17 to their superior strength. This was the\nteam's first opportunity to meet and thank\nMike Adams, an ex-ICRFC captain, who had\nplayed an integral part in the organisation of\nthe tour. Saturday 8th July was an extravaganza of sporting activity. We watched the\nrowers pull their oars in the morning before\nit was our turn to take on the might of the\nCalgary Saints in the afternoon. After weathering an early storm we fought back ferociously and hung on to win 23-20 in a titanic\nstruggle played in the strength sapping heat.\nA superb team effort coupled with superior fitness, ensured we finished the tour on a playing high. Professor John Archer,\nImperial's Deputy Rector, addressed a gathering of alumni in the club house and everybody enjoyed both the after match feast as\nwell as the evening's entertainments.\nBeing all-round sportsmen, the final day's\" a town whose inhabitants\ncould quite easily have been\nthe cast of Northern\nExposure\"\ncricket match proved no problem as we triumphed in a keenly fought 20 over contest\nagainst the alumni in the scenic Riley park.\nThere was time afterwards for some final\npress ie shopping or rodeo before departing\nfor the airport.\nTaking off in the middle of an electrical\nstorm was a further memorable experience of\na wonderful tour which sadly had to end. It\nwas a very exhausted but cheerful party\nwhich arrived back at Heathrow after an\nunforgettable fortnight.\nBY MATT ANSTEAD\nRESULTS\nICRFC vs PORT ALBERINI BLACK SHEEP\nVICTORIA VELOX\nKELOWNA CROWS\nCALGARY KANNUCKS\nCALGARY SAINTS\n10\n24\n17\n17\n23\n-14\n-0\n-29\n-28\n-20\n\n"
