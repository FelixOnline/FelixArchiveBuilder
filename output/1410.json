Scanning through\na time line of his life, he was fortunate\nenough to receive fame, fortune and\ncritical acclaim throughout much of\nhis career, but suffered from much ill\nhealth before his dramatic suicide at\nhis studio in 1970. A new exhibition\nat Tate Modern looks over his later\nworks, which are adored by art buffs\n(this exhibition has attracted rave\nreviews and universal admiration) but,\nin my experience, are often unappreciated by the rest of us because of their\nperceived simplicity and lack of any\nsubject matter. I certainly had little\ntime for them up until now. But is this\nexhibition likely to change minds or\ndoes it merely cater for the already\nconverted?\nBefore I embark upon the Rothko\npress view, I consume the world\u2019s\nsmallest cappuccino in Tate Modern\u2019s\nespresso bar (it claims to be \u201cmedium\u201d).\nIt would have been quite cute had it\nnot cost me \u00a31.90. I may be forced to\nkeep the cup for further use just to feel\nlike I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth. The\ngift shop on the same level as the exhibit has a multitude of repetitive postcards that don\u2019t inspire hope for the\nexhibition, and a wide range of gifties\nin that rusty Rothko red. The woolen\nscarves are rather handsome, but \u00a345.\nSigh. Following on from the diminutive\ncappuccino, this is another example of\nmonetaryrapingbyTatetocompensate\nfor their free museum entry. It should\nbe noted that admission to the Rothko\nexhibition is \u00a312.50 and for us students\nit\u2019s only reduced to \u00a310.50. That\u2019s a fair\nfew pints in the union.\nThis is the second press viewing\nI\u2019ve been to. The first (who remembers Duchamp, Man Ray and Picabia?\nAnybody?) was practically empty, but\nthis one is rammed to the gills. There\nare a disgusting number of film crews\npresent, who make noise and tut if\nyou get in their shot, almost ruining my enjoyment of the whole thing.\nOn the bright side, the crowds of arty\nfarty journalistic types makes for some\ngood people watching. Everybody here\nseems to know each other (except me,\nof course). There\u2019s a lot of \u201cDARLING!\u201d\nand embracing going on. An added bo-nus: within 20 seconds I\u2019ve got my eye\non a young man with some exceedingly\nsexy geek chic going on. Oooh.\nSomething that will strike many visitors is that many of the rooms are in\nrelative darkness. This is a bit startling at first, and doesn\u2019t aid me when\nI\u2019m taking notes, but it is necessary.\nIt complements the painting beauti-fully, adding to the rich and moody\natmosphere.\nThe Tate is clearly very proud of getting its hands on nine of the Seagram\nMurals, and the press release bangs\non about them at length. The Seagram\nMurals were commissioned in 1958 to\ndecorate the fancy Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan\u2019s Seagram build-ing. The original commission allowed\nfor seven paintings. Rothko produced\n30 canvases, but he withdrew from the\ncommission and they never made it to\nthe restaurant. These nine are the biggest of Rothko\u2019s works here. Orangey\nreds, a little brighter than some of his\nothers, they involve hollow squares\nand rectangles, in contrast to the simple blocks of his other canvases. They\ntake pride of place in both room 3 and\nthe press release, dominating the exhi-bition. Chronology aside, I\u2019d have preferred them not to be so intimidatingly\nearly on in the exhibition. I\u2019d rather\nhave been eased into Rothko, perhaps\ncoming to a steamy climax with them\nat the end.\nRoom 4 is a good room after my uneasiness in the vast room 3. Here there\nare some rather charming photos of\nRothko\u2019s studio, which is the kind of\nthing I like to see in these special ex-hibitions. Also in room 4 is \u201cBlack on\nMaroon\u201d (1958) which you can walk\nbehind to view, behind glass, the back\nof the canvas signed by the artist. I\nlike that. I also like the display about\nRothko\u2019s painting techniques, with a\nsplattering of art conservation expertise here. This reveals the technical\nbrilliance of Rothko that is so often\nunderestimated.\nRoom 5 is another good one. \u201cUntitled\u201d of 1964 (most of Rothko\u2019s work\nis untitled, which I find lackluster\n\u2013 he should have come up with wild\nand abstract titles for the poor things)\nis simpler and crisper than a standard Rothko, and really very elegant,\nwhile still in the usual earthy reds and\nbrowns. \u201cNo. 5\u201d (1964) is seemingly\nblack on black but really isn\u2019t. The\nmore you look at it the more you see\nit\u2019s actually a deep bluey purply black\non a reddish maroonish black with a\npaler tinge where they meet. It is precisely like staring into velvet, or a black\nhole. I adore that about Rothko. It\u2019s like\nhe\u2019s working with infinity, looking into\nthe abyss. Into a deep, dark, blackened\nsoul. I could get poetic here. I wonder\nif different people see different things\nand feel different emotions when confronted with Rothko. They\u2019re dark and\nempty, but to me in a comforting way\n\u2013 like cuddling up in a warm, dark, velvety blanket at night. But I can imagine\nfor some this could be terribly morbid\nand depressing, like staring into the\nmouth of death.\nIn room 6 there\u2019s a chance to sit\ndown, which the balls of my feet appreciate (I wore 3 inch heels. Why?\nBecause I\u2019m very very stupid). This is\na good room to sit down in awhile because it\u2019s more black-on-black (and yet\nnot black-on-black) paintings. There\nare four of them, superficially identical\nbut the more you look the more they\nvary. The one on my left is glossier, the\none behind me plummier, another has\nmore distinctive boundaries between\nshades of black.\nIf you\u2019re an art rookie you probably\nwon\u2019t like this exhibition, which is its\nflaw. It\u2019s inaccessible and elitist (and\nthe ticket price doesn\u2019t help). If you\ndon\u2019t get it, fuck off. We\u2019re not going\nto explain it to you. The exhibition\nlaunches in without proper introduction or explanation. It\u2019s difficult to get\nany sense of Rothko\u2019s life or the story\nbehind his work without forking out\nfor the audioguide or paying dedicated\nattention to the free mini guide. Upon\nreading this for the first time (half way\nthrough the exhibition, so I kick my-self) I realise the exhibition \u201cstarts\u201d\nwhen Rothko was already an artist in\nhis prime. It starts with The Seagram\nMurals because there\u2019s at the beginning of the period we\u2019re covering.\nIt all makes sense to me now, but I\u2019m\ndisappointed. I came here eager to find\nout how an artist gets to this style, this\never-repeating format of dark colours\non dark colours. I want to see the jour-ney, the development. I think it\u2019s important to see an artist in their context\n\u2013 within the history around them and\namong their fellow artists. I don\u2019t feel\nlike I\u2019m getting to know Rothko in this\nexhibition. To me, an exhibition about\nan individual artist should make you\nfeel like the artist is a friend of yours,\nhelping you to understand what they\nwere thinking. I like to leave an exhibition teary-eyed because the hero\ndies at the end. But Rothko isn\u2019t my\nfriend here. I\u2019m making friends with\nthe paintings, looking deep into their\nsouls, but I\u2019m not looking into Mark\nRothko\u2019s soul.\nIf you don\u2019t come here with a keen,\nopen mind you\u2019re going to be bored.\nLet\u2019s face it, it all looks the same. Block\ncolour on block colour, hint of haziness\nwhere they meet, if you can see where\nthey meet at all. Even I\u2019m struggling to\npick out key pieces to tell you about. In\nroom 7 we do get a sudden splash of\nvariation. The reds get a little brighter,\nyes, but now we\u2019re getting some shape.\nSquares and stripes and bars. All still\nuntitled, these simple pieces are not\ndistinguished from the previously very\nsimple pieces, but the slight contrast\nmakes them seem so suddenly busy and\nrebellious. But in the grand scheme of\nArt these are still almost blank, lacking\nin topic or subject matter.\nRoom 8 is different again. A series of\ncanvases split on the horizontal into\ntwo colours. Where the split occurs\nvaries around the pieces and I wonder\nif this is significant. The colours are\nalso different \u2013 more blue, more light\ngrey. But the brush work is rougher,\nscratchier. The line splitting the colours makes me think of horizons, of\nlooking into the distance or at the seaside or the sky at night. You can almost\npick out objects or structures in the\ndistance like it\u2019s a landscape. Room 9\nis much like room 8 with canvases split\nbetween two colours like horizons. But\nthese, again difficult to distinguish because they\u2019re all untitled, are black on\ntop and grey on the bottom. The canvases are slightly different shapes and\nsizes each time, but the colours and\nthe outcomes are the same. Room 9 is,\nunexpectedly, the last room. I can see\nthe exit. Usually when I reach the end\nof an exhibition I\u2019m quite keen to es-cape, but today I\u2019m left a little wanting.\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve got to the bottom\nof Rothko.\nI feel guilty about skipping both the\ncurator\u2019s tour and the audioguide, like\nI might be missing the point or denying\nmyself the explanation. But shouldn\u2019t\nan exhibition be self-evident? It really\nreally isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what to conclude here. It\u2019s not what I\u2019d hoped for.\nI have no better knowledge of Rothko\nas an artist than I did when I walked\nin. I worry that visitors, including\nyou readers, will be let down by this.\nSo many people will visit and hate it,\nnot get it or find it boring. But on the\npositive, these paintings are astoundingly beautiful. I adored the blocks of\ndark colours on dark colours, the black\non black, more than I ever expected\nto. I could have stared into them for\nhours. They\u2019re spiritual and thought-provoking. Walking through this exhibition is like meditation. Rothko\u2019s\nwork is a religious experience, and I\nunderstand now why the Menil chapel\nin the Houston, Texas, is filled with\nhis work. Against all my atheist beliefs\nand anti-religious sentiments, a church\nwould be the perfect place for these\nsoul-searching paintings. On the wall\nout by the espresso bar there is a Mark\nRothko quote that I think sums it all\nup rather well: \u201cIf people want sacred\nexperiences they will find them here.\nIf they want profane experiences they\nwill find them too. I take no sides\u201d.\nThe Rothko exhibition is on until\n1st February 2009 at Tate Modern.\nAdmission is an eyebrow-raising\n\u00a312.50 (or \u00a310.50 to us students)\nbut why not treat yourself to celebrate the start of a new year?\nOpen 10am-6pm and late night\nuntil 10pm on Friday and Saturday, so you\u2019ve got no excuse\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend\nmy entire graduate\nscheme staring at the\nsame four walls.\u201d\n\u00a9\n2008\nKPMG\nEurope\nLLP,\na\nUK\nlimited\nliability\npartnership,\nis\na\nholding\ncompany\nof\na\nnumber\nof\nmembers\nof\nthe\nKPMG\nnetwork\nof\nindependent\nmember\nfirms\naffiliated\nwith\nKPMG\nInternational,\na\nSwiss\ncooperative.\nKPMG\nEurope\nLLP\nand\nKPMG\nInternational\nprovide\nno\nclient\nservices.\nKPMG LIFE is our on-campus event.\nIt\u2019s your chance to learn the facts about who we are, what we do and how we\noffer an exciting range of graduate opportunities across Audit, Tax and Advisory.\nDiscover the true meaning of LIFE.\nCome and see us on 13th October in Lecture Theatre 1, Sir Alexander\nFleming Building between 6.30-8.30pm.\nPre-register at kpmg.co.uk/life for fast-track entry.\nBring your aspirations to LIFE.\nRothko really REALLY liked his red squares. If you\u2019re not a fan of red squares you probably won\u2019t like the\nSeagram Murals that Tate Modern are so proud of. And, let\u2019s face it, you probably won\u2019t like Rothko at all\nEgads, it\u2019s not a red square! Does it look a bit like the seaside at night?\nSee? More red squares. I had about 8 different press images to choose from, all red squares. I thought about flipping some round to see if anybody noticed (but didn\u2019t, I\u2019m a good girl)\n\n"

A university spokesman said\na formal inquiry was being launched\ninto alleged \u201cbullying and intimidation\u201d during initiation ceremonies.\nStudent initiations have been in the\nmedia spotlight in the past. In 2003,\n18-year-old Alex Doji died in an initiation ceremony at Staffordshire University after choking on his own vomit.\nAnother student, 18-year-old Gavin\nBritton died after attending a golf initiation ceremony at Exeter University\nin 2006. Following these unfortunate\nincidents, as well as the recent BBC\nreport, NUS President Wes Streeting\ntold the BBC that: \u201cWe are totally opposed to student initiations. They put\nstudents at serious risk and exclude\nstudents who don\u2019t want to take part in\nthat binge-drinking culture.\u201d\nImperial College Union [ICU] have\nhad initiations banned for several\nyears. In the 2007 Clubs and Societies Policy, point 63 states that; \u2018Initiation ceremonies, or other compulsory\n(or effectively compulsory) degrading\nrituals, which affects the physical or\nmental well-being of members, are\nnot permitted. Such behaviour may\nresult in severe disciplinary action being taken against the club or society,\nits committee and any others involved,\nand may result in the dissolution of the\nclub or society.\u2019\nIn light of recent events, Imperial\nCollege London have also informed\ntheir staff at Harlington and Teddington Sports grounds to keep an eye out\nfor any initiations taking part. Neil\nMosley, Head of Sport Imperial, re-af-firmed this publicly in my presentation\nat the sports captains event.\nIn order for a club to receive union\nfunding, they have to ensure that any\nperson may join that club, regardless\nof ability. By having initiation ceremo-nies, clubs were being selective and\nwould therefore not be entitled to Union funding. ICU President Jenny Morgan commented that \u201cOur members\nare encouraged to enjoy themselves\nand celebrate club achievements at the\nUnion, however, they are also encouraged to behave and drink responsibly\nwhilst doing so. Any profit made by the\nbars is ploughed back into the services\nprovided to our members, for example\nthrough club funding. The best interests of our members are our main\nconcern and so the Union does not\nserve alcohol to anyone who is drunk\nand therefore incapable of rational\nthought or action because the safety of\nour members is absolutely paramount.\nWe are a charity, and so while our commercial outlets are there to raise funds,\ndoing so is in no way worthwhile if\nour students are at the slightest risk of\ndanger.\u201d\nAt universities nationwide, initiations are mainly associated with sports\nteams, with many viewing them as a social bonding tool, whilst others view it\nas a form of bullying. Claims have also\nbeen made in the past that initiations\nhave actually deterred students from\ntaking part in sports teams, which was\none of the main reasons for ICU to ban\nthem in the first place.\nBack in 2006 [Issue 1346], felix reported on initiations after the death\nof a student at Hull who fell down\nsome stairs after consuming excessive\namounts of alcohol.\nAlthough fears have been raised in\nthe past over this matter, the main arguments for and against remain. Realistically, can there ever be an effective\nban, or will the ban simply cause them\nto go underground.\nStudents at the university of Gloucestershire taking part in the initiations\nwww.bp.com/ukgraduates\n\u00ae\nWe\u2019ll take you there, and beyond.\nWe are going to previously inaccessible places to find the\nenergy that the world depends on today and in the future.\nThe Atlantis platform in the Gulf of Mexico is the deepest\nmoored floating oil and gas production facility in the world.\nThis 58,700 metric ton semi-submersible platform has over\n18 wells and a mobile drilling unit that enables us to get\nto previously unreachable energy reservoirs.

After\na noisy two years and \u00a311 million of\nrenovation, the Library sees an entirely\nrefurbished ground floor, whilst the remaining floors have been freshened up\nwith a little more than a paint job.\nThe provision of a further 150 communal desk spaces, 90 new computers\nand a 30 seat capacity training room\ngoes some of the way in making up for\nthe years of cramped and sweaty misery students have had to endure in past\nyears.\nAmongst the stock of numerous\ncorporate soundbites, official College\nreleases push the idea of a \u2018modern\ntwenty first century\u2019 library that will\nbecome the \u2018cultural hub\u2019 of College\nlife. Around 50 decorative canvases,\nseemingly blank or unfinished, have\nbeen donated by Sussex-based artist\nBob Brighton.\nCollege further boasts of \u2018walnut\njoinery\u2019, a \u2018glass stairway\u2019 and a \u2018semitransparent think-tank area.\u2019 So,\nwooden floor skirting, a perspex bannister and further segregation.\nfelix went along to cover the official\nopening ceremony on the 2nd of October, but were told to \u201cstay out the way\u2019\u201d\nof official photography. felix were further encouraged to use official photography in our coverage of the Library\nopening, as to avoid our seemingly\ndirtying presence at the ceremony. Imperial\u2019s student television station stoic\ntv were also turned away, have been informed that filming of the event would\nbe \u2018inappropriate\u2019. felix wonders how\nexplicit a library opening can be to be\ndeemed inappropriate for filming. Student media was sparse with only Live!\nattending.\nCollege delightfully promise that\nrenovation will continue in aim to improve the upper floors. This includes\nthe much reported temperature problem felix covered during the last academic year. For now though, students\ncan still be seen to be cooking their\nfull English breakfasts on fourth floor\ndesks.\nAwe-inspiring; blindingly clashing canvases in favour of books\nPicture: BBc News\n\n"

Disembarking\nfrom the bus, we noticed some seriously hot trannies marching past us; we\nknew we had arrived. The guys in Mendoza had promised us that the women\nin Cordoba were the best in Argentina,\nwe hoped they would not disappoint.\nAfter some sight seeing and relaxation,\nsome of the boys went quad biking in\nthe country which was great fun. Kieran \u201cMario\u201d Burge on his 3rd warning in\nhis doon bug, collided with such force\nto Alex Johnstone\u2019s quad that the two\ncould not be separated. Kieran demonstrated with the instructor that the\nbreaks did not work, only for the demonstrator to demonstrate they were\nworking fine, Kieran then went on to\ninsult his mother in fluent Italian\u2026 JJ,\nmeanwhile, had been getting his friend\non with a rather peculiar girl on the\nroof of the hostel, details could not\nbe extracted, apart from a mumbling\nabout twice as much as Chumble.\nOur 4th and last match was in Gorge\nRosse, which was actually 250km away\nfrom Cordoba. Borja arrived minutes\nbefore the 8am depart time. The first\nquestion on everyone\u2019s lips to Borj\nwent like this:\nGeneral Tourist: \u201cBorj did you consummate your friendship?\u201d\nBorj : \u201cYeh! And she was a virgin!\u201d\nGeneral Tourist: \u201cWhat, she bled?\u201d\nBorj : \u201cNo, she does a lot of horse rid-ing, but I could tell\u201d\nGeneral Tourist: \u201cSo she never said\nshe was a virgin?\u201d\nICHC does Berlin\nThis year\u2019s Imperial College Hockey\nClub tour was to Berlin, mainly because\nthere\u2019s lots to do and lots of teams to\nplay (always a problem on tour). We\nstarted as we meant to go on \u2013 pulling an all nighter at the Union before\ncatching an early flight from Gatwick.\nWell, most of us caught the flight, Diana forgot his passport and had to persuade his hall warden to drive it out to\nhim before catching a later flight, costing him over \u00a3130!! From the airport\nthe famously reliable German transport network failed us, by seemingly\nrunning out of electricity and we had\nto take a circuitous route through most\nof Berlin before finding our hostel in a\ngrimy area of East Berlin. As tour sec I\nwas also on a bit of a losing streak, successfully losing people at the rate of 1\nan hour for most of the first day. (Don\u2019t\nworry, they all found their way to the\nhostel eventually!)\nOur first match was out in West Berlin against Hockey Club Argo 04. This\nwas played in the middle of the day and\nlast night\u2019s liquid preparation (where\nPraying Mantis got elected mixed captain for tour and Diana was elected\nmen\u2019s captain) and the lack of hockey\nfor a few months showed. It was a close\nmatch for much of the game, but their\nidea of a mixed team (1 girl!) eventually\nshowed and we lost 5-2. However, off\nthe pitch, they turned out to be a fantastic group. They threw a BBQ for us,\nmade us drink from a glass boot and\njoined in our drinking games. The second match was against TC Blau Weiss\na much younger team, with a fairer balance of girls. Yours truly was umpiring\n(I think that makes me an international\nlevel umpire, right?) and it was a close\nfirst half, plenty of girls from both sides\nleaving the score at 4-2 to us. However, our extra stamina and extra subs\nseemed to show in the 2nd half and the\nfinal score was 7-3. No entertainments\nthis time (I think a few had school the\nnext day!) So we had to make our own\namusements by consuming a vast\namount of booze and meat at a nearby\nCroatian themed restaurant.\nNo match on Tuesday so we headed\noff to the zoo where Plug confessed\nhe would like to sleep with a chicken\nand hid his shame by keeping Dunkin\u2019\nDonuts in business for the week. In\nthe evening we headed off on a huge\npub crawl where there was free vodka\nwhich could only lead to the girls and\nboys of ICHC trying to put the Bonobo\nmonkeys from the zoo to shame, if you\nget my drift\u2026 Also, some panic on my\npart as Star Trek had gone AWOL at\nsometime, I was just starting to wonder how you filled a missing persons\nreport in German when he strolled\nthrough the arch of the hostel!\nOn Wednesday, feeling somewhat\nworse for wear we played a men\u2019s match\nagainst a very strong Berliner Sport\nClub side. We played the club\u2019s 2nd\nteam, but we later found out their first\nteam played in the hockey equivalent\nof the Championship, this in a country\nthat won the hockey gold at this year\u2019s\nOlympics. We did lose this match 3-1,\nscoring with a cracking goal from Nugget Porn. We did put up a great fight\nthough and it was only a moment of\nmadness from keeper Cotton-eyed Joe\nand a penalty stroke that separated us!\nThey also turned out to be great bunch\nof guys and we stayed late helping to\nempty their bar. They also enjoyed our\npunishment for leaving kit on the pitch,\nmaking the forgetful player drink a\npint through it; the Germans promised\nto make future forgetful players from\ntheir club injure a similar penalty.\nOur last game was against SV Berliner B\u00e4ren. They were a closely matched\nside, but we were better and should\nhave won it. However, some controversial umpire decisions and a moment\nof madness from keeper Cotton-eyed\nJoe led to us going down 3-2 with a\ngood showing from some of the players\nfrom the lower teams in the club, with\ngoals from both Fourplay and Friendly\nFire. This team treated us to a meal\nof schnitzel and chips after and plenty\nHenley Royal Regatta\nOn the final day of racing at Henley the\npressure was on the men\u2019s coxless four\nto bring victory to Imperial competing\nfor the Visitor\u2019s Challenge Cup. Don\u2019t\nbe mislead by the term coxless, this was\na crew of pure 100% MAN, or beast/\nmachine-hybrid, we aren\u2019t sure, but\nthankfully there is no pending investigation from the powers that be. Triumph lay in the large, unmoisturised\nand capable hands of Imperial\u2019s Simon\nHislop and George Whittaker, teamed\nwith Kingston R.C.\u2019s Keiron West and\nstroke man Trigger. After months of\nintensive land training at ICBC and\nwater sessions on the tideway the\ncoaching team were in no doubt as to\nthe potential outcome. The first race\ntook place on Saturday where London\nR.C. & Wallingford R.C. became the\nfirst casualty and were easily defeated.\nBad weather conditions hampered the\nfinal days racing schedule and after a\nrestart, some paint chippings and more\ntime delays, the race eventually got\nunderway with the Imperial composite crew out muscling Martyrs B.C. &\nChrist Church, Oxford by 1 \u00bc lengths.\nICBC are very proud of all four crew\nmembers who were outright deserved\nwinners. Much expensive champagne\nwas sprayed around and the blazers\nwere dusted off for the prize giving\nceremony to collect their accolade for\n\u2018Most Dashing Bow Pair\u2019.\nMeanwhile ICBC supporters spent\nthe weekend sampling Cobra Beer, collecting Vaseline body lotion samples\nfor healthy resilient skin, trying out the\nlatest fad on the erg scene and generally cheering for anybody with a name\nthat could be easily pronounced. For\nthose of us lucky enough to be deemed\nworthy of the steward\u2019s enclosure, the\nafternoons slipped away in a haze of\noversized blazers, sunshine, Pimms\nand general poncing. Here one could\npurchase ladies hats, because ladies\nare encouraged to wear hats. Henley is\na unique and prestigious event, one of\nthe few places on earth where regatta\nradio is appreciated.\nCould you swim a mile for charity?\nWhat about two? How about twenty-four?\nOn Saturday 4 \u2013 Sunday 5 October,\nErika Cule (President) and Julia Hornig\n(Treasurer) of Imperial College Swim\nand Water Polo Club took part in the\n\u201cUltimate Swimming Challenge\u201d \u2013\nswimming one mile, on the hour, every\nhour, for twenty-four hours.\nBoth managed half the distance,\ntwelve miles apiece - a tough enough\nachievement. One mile is thirty-two\nlengths of a fifty metre pool, equivalent to sixty-four lengths of the pool\nat Ethos. As well as swimming fatigue,\npowerful chlorine fumes made breathing difficult. Participants battled with\nsleep deprivation, and nutrition and\nhydration were difficult too.\nBy seven miles in the first swimmer\nhad called it a day, and after halfway\nthe numbers fell further. Of twenty-eight starters, only the seven fittest and\nmost determined made it to the end,\ntestament to the unique severity of this\ndifficult task.\n2swim4life was the brainchild of\nStewart Rush, a dad from Petersfield\nin Hampshire whose son Joe was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular\nDystrophy last year. After a ten-mile\nfundraising swim of his own in May\n2008, Stewart cast around for a bigger\nchallenge and hit upon the 24-hour-swimathon, a format that to the team\u2019s\nknowledge has not been attempted\npreviously.\nThe event aims to raise \u00a320,000 for\nAction Duchenne, the only national\nCharity that exclusively funds research\nfor a cure and promotes campaigns for\nUltimate Swimming\nbetter medical care for Duchenne and\nBecker Muscular Dystrophy.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a\ngenetic disorder caused by a mutation\nin the dystrophin gene. The condition\ncauses progressive muscle weakness as\nthe muscle cells break down and die. It\nis a rare condition with about 100 sufferers born in the UK each year and\nabout 1,500 boys with the disorder living in the country at any one time.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy,\nnamed after the doctor who first studied this specific condition in the 1800s,\nmainly affects boys, with extremely\nrare exceptions.\nMost affected boys show the first\nsymptoms of motor difficulties as tod-dlers. As they get older and the condition progresses they may be unable to\nwalk as far or as fast as other children,\noccasionally even falling down. Some\nboys may also have learning or behavioural difficulties which start to show\nat this stage.\nDuchenne is a progressive disorder\n- young men are totally paralysed by\nlate teens and die young from respiratory or heart failure. Your donations\nand support will help us end this tragic\nwaste of young lives. To congratulate\nthe swimmers and donate to this important cause, visit www.justgiving.\ncom/2swim4life\nAfter a great weekend, the team is\nstill actively fundraising, as well as\nmaking plans for next year.

Everyone\nplayed superbly, one man above the\nrest; Freddie Chalk demonstrated a\ncomplete running, passing and kicking\ngame, at his second ever performance\nat 10 and rightly earned himself the\nMan of the Match Award.\nThe celebrations that evening were\ngreat with lots of beer and Fernet.\nSome even speculated they saw Taj\nwith some Fernet, but it could have\nbeen coke\u2026 We were served the most\ndelicious roast pig. When the pig ran\nout our hosts ordered pizza for us.\nEveryone was very tired and we had a 5\nhour coach journey back, so some killjoys wanted to sleep on the coach whilst\nthe rest of the players went to a club.\nIn fairness it was empty, and we had\nagreed with the guys on the coach that\nwe would leave at 2.30-3.00. Most of\nthe boys had got back on the bus, then\non the stroke of 2 the club got packed,\nwith loads of stunners. With only 8 of\nthe tour party remaining, there was a\nqueue of nubile young hotties waiting\nfor their chance to talk to us. Bevis\ngot touchy feely with one, only for her\nbrother to get a bit worried because\nshe was 16. She was telling him she was\nfree from or so he claims. This amazing scenario was cut short by Malcolm\nSim; insisting that staying whilst everyone else was asleep on the coach, was\njust \u201cDisgusting\u201d behaviour.\nAfter the last match everyone realised that we then had 12 days of holiday ahead of us. It was about to get a\nlittle messy.\nThe 22 hour bus journey saw Kieran\nand Alex destroy every team who dared\nto challenge them at Tarnib (A.K.A.\nTurnip, A.K.A. Lebanese Bridge).\nEven Badger \u201cI played international\nbridge for England U16\u201d couldn\u2019t halt\ntheir progression to the top. But then\nagain he also came up with gems such\nas \u201cPeanut once took a 6kg dump, it\u2019s\ntrue, it happened\u201d.\nEveryone was very chuffed to discover that we had a pool when we got\nto Iguazu, with captain supreme Anjit\nbeing the first in. After a spot of rock\nclimbing and a boat trip, the hostel had\na big BBQ with lots of caipirinhas. For\nsome reason Anjit and the manager\nhad a disagreement about Anjit\u2019s superb dancing abilities, which was settled with a promise from one of the\nyounger members that he would be-have. Later we all headed into Puerto\nIguazu for what was a great night. The\nnext day, Iguazu Falls was on the agenda and it was absolutely breathtaking,\neven the great bear James Pettit was\nhumbled by the sheer magnitude of\nthe waterfalls. That evening the boys\ntucked into numerous Irish girls whilst\nChumble had the privilege of visiting\none of the infamous pay per hour ho-tels. Joe Brown was now sporting a ridiculous hair cut, with the excuse \u201cThe\nclippers ran out of battery\u201d.\nThe departure time to return to BA\nwas put back hour after hour as the\nboys enjoyed splendid sunshine and\ncheap caipirinhas around the pool.\nChumble delayed the departure back\nto BA, by insisting he would just nip\nto the toilet as we were departing\u2026.40\nminutes later we finally set off.\nBack in Buenos Aires the agenda was\nshopping, and other cultural activities such as eating and drinking. A few\nmore memorable nights out ensured\nthe tour was a great success and thoroughly enjoyed by all. The boys were\nall very nostalgic about heading back,\nand our time in Argentina certainly\nwon\u2019t be forgotten. Rugby gave us the\ncommon ground to make lots of new\nfriends with people from a different\nculture. We are certainly going to try\nand emulate the Argentine\u2019s \u201c3rd half\u201d\nwhenever we have the opportunity at\nHarlington. The Argentines\u2019 generosity was beyond comparison, inviting\nus into their homes and providing us\nwith copious amounts of food and\ndrink, they really demonstrated what\nthe spirit of rugby is all about.\nTour veteran Badger commented\n\u201cThat it was far better organised than\nprevious tours.\u201d This can only be attributed to the hard work of the tour\ncommittee. Special mention to Joe\nBrown who toured with a broken hand\nand couldn\u2019t play but instead came\nup with a simple and successful game\nplan, a significant contribution to a\ntour which will be remembered for\nmany years to come.\nIan Lawrence\nICHC Tour Secretary\nErika Cule\nDisc Doctors spin Europe\nThe summer has been an exciting one\nfor the Ultimate Frisbee team, known\nas Disc Doctors (or dD). For those that\ndon\u2019t know, Ultimate is a mixed team\nsport played with a frisbee, either in-doors, outdoors on grass, or on the\nbeach. Lazily, it can be described as a\ncross between netball and American\nFootball. More specifically, however,\nthere are between five and seven players on each team, with the aim being\nto pass the disc between team mates,\nworking it up the pitch to score a point\nin the opposing team\u2019s end-zone. Good\nspirit is a big part of the game, and so\nmatches are refereed between players,\nwith no external official, and any fouls\nare sorted out between those involved.\nAt the beginning of July, 16 dD set off\nto sunny Finland, the land of 22 hour\nsunshine and saunas. Having never\npreviously entered, the tournament on\nYteri beach was to be a new experience\nfor the team. Rumours were spreading\nof the fierce, efficient playing style of\nthe northern Europeans so it came with\nwelcome relief that we were seeded in\nthe very depths of the team tables.\nClad in red shorts, custom yellow\nshirts and copious amounts of colour\ncoordinating accessories, the team had\nalready blown away the competition in\nthe style sweepstakes. Unfortunately\nthe match against Dark Side early Saturday morning wasn\u2019t such a walko-ver. Having arrived several days early\nin Finland, most of the squad seemed\nafflicted with mysterious morning\nheadaches (read: hangovers), giving\nrise to a sloppy first couple of points.\nSome desperate play helped us claw\nback to put the score roughly even but\nthe opposition eventually pulled away\nagain to win 6-4. Play started gelling\ntogether a bit better in the next game\nagainst PIP. Points were traded as up-wind/downwind play rotated but with\nbeach Ultimate teams only consisting\nof 5 players, the team were able to find\nthe extra fresh legs in the squad to beat\nPIP at a point cap of 6-5.\nFor the final match of the day dD deployed some advanced defence to take\nadvantage of the intensifying wind.\nA zone formation was adopted and\nproved very difficult for Finnish natives Albino Wales to break through.\nLots of turnovers were forced giving\nus many scoring opportunities, with a\nvery good number bearing fruit. Halfway through the short 40 minute game\ndD had a comfortable 5-2 lead. The\nAlbino Wales responded with a zone\ndefence of their very own, resulting in\na gruelling point. A slight advantage in\nstamina gave the Wales the strength to\nwin the crucial point and unfortunately\nthe rest of the game, finishing 9-6.After\na good, hard day\u2019s Ultimate, the team\nwere looking forward to showing the\nrest of the world how to party. Turning\nup fashionably late, dressed for sum-mer, dD took the beach disco by storm.\nAn unforgettable night slowly drifted\ninto the morning \u2013 especially considering night only lasted two dusky hours.\nThe rest of the tournament went very\nsuccessfully, with two more wins and a\nfinal seeding of 8th out of 32 teams.\nThe displays of diplomacy across the\nthree days combined with gifts for the\nother teams earned dD the Spirit of the\nGame prize: a massive, novelty bottle\nof champagne, just going to show that\nwinning on the field (or beach) isn\u2019t always the most important thing. Then,\nin the dying days of the summer (Sep-tember, actually, but there was really\nno summer to have dying days of) dD\nembarked upon the highlight of our\nUltimate calendar. The Burla Beach\nCup is an international mixed Ultimate tournament played on the beach\nin Viareggio, Italy. This year it was held\nbetween the 19th and 21st September\nand saw us returning for our 4th year\nand aiming to improve upon our 17th\nseeding out of 30 from 2007.\nThe first day of the tournament saw\nus playing three teams \u2013 two Belgian\nand one British \u2013 for rank in our pool.\nWe beat each of them pretty convincingly and the wet conditions seemed\nto help us on our way. So, pleased with\nour performance and our games done\nfor the day, and the weather now suitably Italian, we had lots of time to relax\non the beach with a few drinks before\ngoing to the party that night.\nFuelled by our successful start but\nslightly hindered from drinking the\nnight before, we were ready to take\non the teams in our challenging pool.\nWe won the first game against an Irish\nteam in a very hard fought match, but\nlost the last two to the 2007 winners\nand then the eventual winners of this\nyear\u2019s tournament \u2013 overall a real bitch\nof a pool! We ended up joint second in\nour group just to be relegated to 4th\nplace due to points difference, meaning we would return the next day fighting for 13th place. Although slightly\ndeflated, we knew we had a good night\nahead of us in the form of the zombie/\nhorror themed main party.\nOn the Sunday we headed to the\nbeach in a wholly unconvincing state\nto play Ultimate: there were those of\nus that were hungover and those who\nweren\u2019t \u2013 but only because they were\nstill drunk. It was a picture that dD had\nseen all too often. However, playing in\nthis state is a skill every dD player is\nborn with, and we managed pretty easy\nwins over the two teams (Belgium and\nAustria) to earn our 13th place. Overall\nit was an excellent tournament with a\nhealthy mix of competition, sunshine\nand parties. Look out for Burla 2009\nwhen dD will return to the beaches of\nViareggio!\nof beer to go around. The following\nnight was our last night in Berlin and\nwe celebrated in style. We started with\na huge fine circle, with punishments\ndealt out by chairman PF for transgressions throughout the tour, resulting in a dual stick pint for Friendly\nFire and Board Shorts. We also dealt\nout the tour awards; Token Lezza was\nawarded Player of the Tour and Diana\nwas awarded T*at of the Tour. We then\nmoved on, in true British team on tour\nstyle, to a local curry house, leading to\nsome technicolour moments courtesy\nof Charlie 2. Later came various bars\nand clubs of which I have no memory,\nbut apparently Fourplay sent me home\nin a taxi due to my level of inebriation!\nWe made it back with no problems\non Saturday and I left everyone to\nmake their way home to various corners of the UK. It was a good tour,\nshort and sweet with lots of hockey,\nhow it should be!\nICHC would like to that IC Trust for\ntheir continued support of the club.\nMichael Foster\nChristina Duffy\nContinued from back page\nCaptain Praying Mantis preparing for battle.\nCrew and coaches celebrate after winning the Visitor\u2019s Challenge Cup.\nThe boys chilling with Caipirinhas in Iguazu!\nMonday 13th October\nBadminton\nMixed 1s ULU vs King\u2019s College Mixed 1s\nNetball\nWomens\u2019s 1s ULU vs Royal Holloway 1s\nWomen\u2019s 2s ULU vsImperial Medicals 3s\nSquash\nMen\u2019s 3s ULU vs Imperial Medicals Men\u2019s 1s\nMen\u2019s 1s ULU vs Imperial College Men\u2019s 2s\nVolleyball\nMixed 1s ULU vs LSE Mixed 1s\nWatepolo\n1st ULU vs University College\nWednesday 15th October\nBadminton\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Portsmouth Men\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs King\u2019s College Men\u2019s 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Reading Women\u2019s 1st\nBasketball\nMen\u2019s 1st vs London South Bank Men\u2019s 2nd\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Roehampton Uni Women\u2019s 1st\nFencing\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs University College Men\u2019s 2nd\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Kent Women\u2019s 1st\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Brunel West London Men\u2019s 3rd\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs Uni of Greenwich Men\u2019s 3rd\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Roehampton Uni Women\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 3rd vs Universities at Medway Men\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 4s ULU vs University College Men\u2019s 5s\nMen\u2019s 5s ULU vs University College Men\u2019s 6s\nMen\u2019s 6s ULU vs King\u2019s Medics Men\u2019s 5s\nMen\u2019s 7s ULU vs Goldsmiths Men\u2019s 3s\nHockey\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs Queen Mary Men\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Essex Men\u2019s 1st\nWomen\u2019s 2nd vs Uni of Portsmouth Women\u2019s\n2nd\nMen\u2019s 4th vs Kingston Uni Men\u2019s 2nd\nLacrosse\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Brighton Women\u2019s 1st\nNetball\nWomen\u2019s 3rd vs LSE 3rd\nWomen\u2019s 2nd vs Universities at Medway 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Hertfordshire 1st\nRugby\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs St Barts Men\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 3rd vs Uni of Sussex Men\u2019s 2nd\nMen\u2019s 1st vs UWE Bristol Men\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 4th vs Universities at Medway 1st XV\nSquash\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs King\u2019s College Women\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs Uni of Hertfordshire Men\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Kent Men\u2019s 1st\nTable Tennis\nMen\u2019s 1st vs University College London Men\u2019s 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Middlesex Uni Women\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Reading Men\u2019s 1st\nTennis\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs Roehampton Uni Men\u2019s 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs London Met Uni Women\u2019s 2nd\nVolleyball\nWomen\u2019s 2nd vs Uni of Essex Women\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Kent Men\u2019s 1st\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Kent Men\u2019s 1st\nWaterpolo\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Uni of Warwick Men\u2019s 1st\nFixtures in association with Sports Partnership\n\n"

With its bridge that is home to surly punks who will swear and spit at you if\nyou dare to take pictures of them! The glorious loch with flashy new eateries such as Hi Sushi and Lloyd\u2019s\nbar juxtaposed with the gangs of copulating Goths further down (just close your eyes). It\u2019s often possible to\nfeel pretty drab and conventional in Camden even though your attire may turn heads in the Sherfield build-ing. If you do feel as if your wardrobe needs a shake up then this is the perfect place to accessorize with\nquirky tees, skinny jeans, tutus, funky tights and way way more. Anyone with a penchant for body mods\n(tats, piercings, scarification etc) will find top-notch establishments here to get the work done. Cold Steel\nfor piercings and Evil from the Needle for tats and I can personally assure both are clean and professional\nand do a fantastic job. For the foodies Camden is a haven with lots of hidden gems serving awesome nosh.\nOut of selfishness I will not divulge, go and discover your own! The stalls also do cheap, greasy Chinese,\nIndian, Mexican etc. Which is also great if junk is what you crave. I would recommend taking time off\nlectures/in between/on a day off to visit as weekends get awfully crowded and if you cannot abide slow,\ngormless walkers then going on a Saturday or Sunday is not recommended.\nThe legendary Koko\u2019s is right outside Mornington Crescent tube and puts on many live bands and club\nnights and is sure to feature in your social calendar at some point. If you would like a more refined evening\ntry the Jazz caf\u00e9 which is highly recommended for jazz lovers. There is no need to say Camden offers a\nhuge range of bars which cover all tastes, the Loch being a good area. The Dublin castle is down and dirty\nand good for indie. Further down the road the Edinburgh castle is a very pleasant, calmer setting; delicious\nfood. Camden Arts centre isn\u2019t strictly in walking distance of its tube station but is worth a visit for the caf\u00e9\nand gorgeous garden if nothing else. The houses of poet John Keats and psychologist Freud are within a\nquarter of a mile radius.\nSouth Kensington\nWhat shall I do to fill those hours between lectures? Go to the library and go over my lecture? Not a chance! It\nis a theory of mine that to work hard and succeed one needs a peaceful and happy mind and so rest, leisure and\npleasure and mandatory. If this comes to you in the form of said library studies then this is will be great for your\ndegree. If not, there is much to distract you within the realms of South Kensington. For one, Kensington Gardens\nis directly opposite the Royal Albert Hall which is located right next to Beit Hall of residence. This park I like to\nrefer to as Hyde Park\u2019s younger and much more beautiful sister. Hyde Park is alright for running and has a pretty\nsection but is, in fact, just a patch of grass. Kensington Garden feels a lot wilder and overgrown which will come\nas welcome relief if you are missing your more rural homes. The Serpentine art gallery is located within the parks\nperimeter and is currently showing Richter\u2019s art. (As in the \u2018Richter scale\u2019 except this is a different Richter).\nThe three big museums cannot have escaped your notice. The Science Museum, The Natural History Museum\nand the Victoria and Albert Museum offer something for each and every taste and are also the cause of the gross\nover population of children around Imperial on the weekdays. Each museum is free and Felix can provide press\ntickets for special exhibitions at the V&A in exchanged for your words on what\u2019s there and whether its worth\nseeing.\nSoho\nEnsconced between the grandeur of Mayfair, the retailers of Oxford Street and Theatreland,\nSoho is made up of quaint criss-crossing (largely) pedestrian streets and is regarded as the\ncentre of London\u2019s colossal gay scene. Here you will never be want of something to amuse\nyou whether it\u2019s an especially flamboyant queen, irresistible boutique, mouth-watering caf\u00e9,\nrestaurant or vibrant bar. Sex shops aplenty, gays, girls and straights alike will find things that\nfloat their boat here. Girls, Paradiso Boutique in Old Compton Street has underwear to die for\nand check out Moaz next door for awesome falafel.\nSoho pretty much overlaps onto theatre-land; the West End. As a London student you are probably the luckiest people in the world in terms of just how much the city has to offer you in terms of\nentertainment. The shows on at any time in the West End will cater for everyone, especially those\nwho abhor the musical, commercialised shit churned out for tourists. Stuck for where to begin?\nWe artsy editors here at Felix will point you in the right direction and even give you free theatre\ntickets. All you have to do is muster your finest writing skills and produce a review!\nFor the less theatrically inclined, the Royal Academy is a hop over Piccadilly Circus in Piccadilly\nitself and houses some beautiful collections of painting, sculpture and more and is always sure to\nhave a stupendous paying exhibition on at anytime. I even saw Sir Stephen Fry walking out in the\nsummer. Swoon. Again, press tickets can be arranged for you as Felix writers. The Photographer\u2019s\nGallery will be a treat for those who love photography and it is also free and situated in Great\nNewport Street adjacent to Leicester Square tube station. Otherwise stay clear of Leicester Square\nas it\u2019s nothing but a hive of tacky tourist attractions (Ripley\u2019s Believe it or Not). However, if that\nis just what your in the mood for, jump right in. The Trocadero is home to sex museum Amora\nwhich is actually worth a look (although admission is \u00a312), great for a first date, believe me!\nBaker Street\nPlenty to get up to here especially for anyone new to London and wants to get all the standard tourist\nattractions out of the way. Madame Tussaud\u2019s houses a collection of celebrity waxworks. You can buy a\nticket for about \u00a350 to London\u2019s \u201cTop 3 attractions\u201d and get Tussaud\u2019s, the Eye and the London Dungeons\n(London Bridge tube station) thrown in. Next to it is the London Planetarium. A short walk away is one\nof my favourite London parks, Regent\u2019s park. Serenely beautiful it also offers places to dine, pretty flowers and events such as a current sculpture exhibition and a Frieze Art fair which features 150 of the most\nexciting contemporary art galleries in the world. It runs until 19 October. The main attraction of Regent\u2019s\nPark is London Zoo, another thing yet to be discovered by me. For some absolutely delicious made-to-order paninis then outside the park\u2019s north-western corner is a little caf\u00e9 on Wellington Road. The name\nescapes me and so you will have to persevere. Apologies if you stumble across the wrong establishment\nand get food poisoning. Man up. On the up side London\u2019s best public convenience 2008 is moments away\nup the road!\nSouthbank\nAccessible from about 6 tube stops, South Bank spans a large chunk of the river and is a very\npretty place to go for a wander if only to soak up some of the ambience. Glorious on a sunny\nday and also gorgeous at night to see the twinkling lights of London reflected on the Thames.\nCrossing any bridge and looking east, St Paul\u2019s can be seen in all its splendour set against the\nCity\u2019s backdrop which is oddly peaceful. The London Eye is here for those wanting a different\nperspective on the city. The Eye is another spectacular thing to behold at night when it is lit\nup with pretty colours. The London Aquarium has its home by Westminster Bridge and for\nsomething a little more \u2018cultural\u2019 the South Bank offers everything. Here lies the National Film\nTheatre, the National Theatre, the Hayward Gallery (always something random and quirky\ngoing on here as well the more conventional arts) and a book market. There are lots of bars\nand restaurants, Benugo is particularly delicious for sumptuous Maris piper potato wedges,\nbut don\u2019t expect student prices!\nAny sk8er boiz (or girls) among you may like to hear that there is a much frequented area\nand beautifully graffitied area for skaters and skateboarders. Big Ben and all that jazz is not far\nif you feel like soaking up some British Heritage.\nBrixton\nOK, OK, normally it is more famous for an evening\u2019s shooting in McDonald\u2019s and it\u2019s pretty\neasy to score drugs outside the tube station (remember everything in moderation), but Brixton has its charms and I find myself oddly fond of it. It has a large number of more grimy,\nunderground dance clubs many opening their doors when others are in the process of closing.\nIt also offers a surprising number of very charming and smart bars which you\u2019d expect more\nfrom Fulham Road. Dogstar in Coldharbour Lane is an example of this, serving up banging\ntunes alongside tasty Mexican food. Further up this road Joy Boutique sells a quirky range\nand men and women\u2019s clothing as well as a random range of novelty items. If you\u2019re partial to\ndelectable Caribbean food then Brixton, well known for its African and Carribbean population will definitely fill your needs. It has its own market a few paces up from the tube and its\nplace on the Victoria Line means its extremely easy to reach from central London. Another of\nmy favourite Brixton haunts is the Ritzy Cinema which shows an excellent selection of films\n(both Limited and Nationwide release) and has a harming bar selling alcohol which can be\nconsumed in its screens. The food upstairs in the caf\u00e9 is truly delish too and even if you are\nnot planning on seeing a movie, the Ritzy is worth visiting for this reason alone.\nThe Carling Academy will almost certainly have something to tempt you whether it\u2019s rock or\ndance music or reggae and it\u2019s a brilliant venue.\nOne very unique club in Brixton is Mass which used to be an old church and now plays\nhome to the fetish club Torture Garden. University is a time of experimentation and doing\nthings we will look back on with either shame or pride and this club night is a perfect way to\ndiscover any hidden fantasies that might lurk beneath your seemingly tame scientist\u2019s exte-rior. As fetish clubs go this is pretty mainstream and it is more about the fancy dress rather\nthan whips and chains. By fancy dress ANYTHING goes, let your imagination run riot. The\nonly thing unacceptable is \u2018streetwear\u2019 (jeans, shirts and the like). Inside you will find everyone to be down to earth, open minded and friendly which is more than can be said for most\nof your \u2018standard\u2019 club nights.\nChapter One \u2013 Fun (for Fresher\u2019s)\nWritten by Caz Knight designed by Rosie Grayburn\n\n"

Welcome to\nanother damn fine edition of Coffee Break.\nHonourable mentions\ngo out to Team Joseph\nGobbels who won last weeks photoshop competition. That picture\nmade many of the guys and girls down\nin the felix office cry hysterically with\nlaughter. Well done, have a gold medal,\nand your on your way to winning an\niPod. I would also like to make a special note about this weeks RAW image\nof the Live! stand. Live! is one of our\nbig rivals within the Imperial College\nstudent media. A big shout out to our\nfriends over there. Keep up the good\nwork, even though the picture of an\nempty stand is somewhat amusing. I\nhave hope that next weeks entries will\nbring the picture to life.\nA bonus point will be given to those\nPhotoshop masters who to manage to\nwrite something amusing in the domain name banner.\nIn a more personal matter, I would\nlike to say something to the freshers.\n\u201cPlease stop being so unhealthy!\u201d As a\nhall senior I\u2019m surrounded by freshers\neverywhere I look. All of them are sick\nwith freshers\u2019 flu. All it takes is a few\nsquare meals or a vitamin tablet and\nyou\u2019ll be sorted. You guys are contagious and I\u2019m getting ill. Now I have my\nsuspicions that it\u2019s all the drinking I\u2019ve\nbeen doing this week but I\u2019m going to\nstick with blaming it on the freshers.\nAnother rant, I\u2019d like to defend current felix editor, Jovan Nedic, for last\nweek\u2019s issue of felix. Sure there were\ngrammatical errors. Maybe even a few\nspelling mistakes, but I am disappointed with the individuals who have slandered the issue. Most of the student\nbody understands that it\u2019s the first issue of the year, and there are bound to\nbe mishaps along the way.\nWhy then are there some people who\ncall for the editor to rethink his ideas,\nsome even stating the newspaper is\ngoing down. It\u2019s a student newspaper\npeople. Not The Guardian. All the\nnews, games, sports and comments\nare intended for the general student.\nSo please a little understanding this\nweek?\nAs what to look forward to... Snakey\nB makes an appearance this week, with\nnext week seeing the start of Sikh MC.\nThe FUCWIT league continues and is\ngoing strong. I\u2019ll lay out a league table\nwhen the competition really fires up.\nIf anything in this or its associate\nsections offend you in any way,\nplease bear in mind I\u2019m not\nresponsible for the Hangman\nteam. Those guys are crazy and\nas a result don\u2019t blame me.\n3. Apple Mac:\nYou\u2019re sitting in the library. You look\nto the left of you. You look to the\nright. Apples everywhere. No not the\ndelicious kind, the knob kind. There\u2019s\neven a job at apple to be a campus\nrep, but only if you\u2019re a huge mac super freak. However, and it makes me\nsad to say it, macs are awesome. Heck\nwe have at least 8 down here in the felix office. It\u2019s like a mac mega dream.\nWho needs lots of video games.\nSpore is all you need right? We\u2019ve all\nseen the students sitting around the\nJCR on the sofas; drinking their cof-fee. Some even reading the student\nnewspaper. The evidence is there, if\nyou want to look like a smug fucking\ngit, grab yourself some California designed - Chinese assembled gadgetry\nand think of the geeky possibilities.\nAlso you get to feel superior because\n\u2018macs don\u2019t get viruses\u2019. IT\u2019S NOT\nBECAUSE THEY\u2019RE GOOD IT\u2019S\nBECAUSE NOBODY MAKES VIRUSES FOR MACS.\nCoffee Break\n32 felix Friday 10 October 2008\nThis weeks winner. Team Joseph Gobbels. Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk\nThis weeks winning entry is a beautiful piece of art. Stop for a moment\nand examine it. This team flipped\nthe face to match the lighting effects in the imposed picture. With a\nmagical flourish, they made the eyes\nall squinty so he\u2019d look vulnerable.\nFinally in a move that clinched the\nprize, they opened the mouth, giving him a baby like look. Opened the\nmouth in such a way, he could only be\nportraying an innocent baby.\nDrink with me, I\u2019m Snakey B\nand this week I\u2019m dressed as Muhammad Ali\nJoe Gobbels has certainly set the\nbar high and if you want to get a shiny\ngold medal you are going to have to up\nyour game.

Every night drunk\ndouche-bags chug me down but\nthere\u2019s never any care. Sometimes I get spilled, you know\nevery now and again I even get thrown\nback up! It\u2019s disgusting I tell ya, I get no\nrespect. No respect at all.\nThings are about to change though.\nSnakey B is back, as Muhammad Ali.\nYou know me, I float like all those pot-heads at the back of Sherfield and I\nsting like the daily rejections meted on\nImperial guys by members of the opposite sex.\nAnd let me say something to all those\nhaters out there. I am the greatest drink\nin the world. No I\u2019m not the greatest\nI\u2019m the double greatest. Not only do I\nknock Medics out but I pick the bucket\nin Reynolds Bar for them to vomit in\nand then drink from.\nI\u2019m so fast that last night, an engineer\ntook off a girls clothes and came in his\npants before they hit the ground.\nSnakey B, as Muhammad Ali, peace\nout Imperial. Who will I be next week?\nI really don\u2019t know what to think.\nVirgo\nThere\u2019s a lady whose\nsure all that glitters\nis gold, and she\u2019s\nbuying a stairway to\nheaven. When she\ngets there she knows\nthat if the stores are all closed with a word she\ncan get what she came for. It isn\u2019t you. All the\nsins you have committed this Freshers, such as\nabusing innocent students with your barf, have\nlanded you into the Second Circle of Hell.\nScorpio\nDoes anyone except\nfor the Americans\ngive a shit about\nyour star sign?\nApparently so. The\nreason you are\nreading this is because you are thick enough\nto forgo the scientific method that you should\nhave sworn your life to, after being accepted\nby Imperial.\nLibra\nOkay, so you\u2019re one\nof those guys that\nthinks that Abercrombie is cool.\nIt\u2019s not. Let me tell\nyou why. Firstly,\nit starts with \u201cAber\u201d, and that sounds Welsh.\nWelsh is most definitely not cool. Second, it\u2019s\nnot even Welsh! It\u2019s like an Australian whose\ngreat-great-grandauntie was Scottish, and who\ntherefore thinks he can wear a kilt.\nSagittarius\nImperial College\nLondon, currently\nrecruiting women.\nUnsuccessful much?\nLet\u2019s brainstorm:\nperhaps we should\nhave merged with UCL. No, wait, then we\u2019d\nhave arts students. Barftastic. Them with their\nvaried interests and presentable clothing. We\ncould never let them taint the hallowed, unin-teresting, and highly pretentious halls of IC.\nCapricorn\nWhen I said that I\u2019d\ndo this I thought it\nwould be easy. Just\nthink up 12 random\nparagraphs and job\ndone. Turns out that\nits much harder. You noticed? Turns out I\u2019ll be\nneeding 12 more next week...... This is really\nhard. I need to find a flaming hot Polish lesbo\nto help me out. With writing the horoscopes,\nthat is.\nCancer\nSo you\u2019re a Cancer,\nyou think you\nknow everything\nabout God. Damn\neverything; well\nyou\u2019re full of shit!\nAnyway this week you\u2019ll probably find out\nyou have a terminal disease or something\n... whatever. That sounds like cancer. Like\nI care. I\u2019m not even the guy who writes the\nhoroscopes.\nGemini\nThe fact you even\nbelong to a group\ncalled Gemini\nmeans you should\nprobably end your\nlife in a horrible\nhorrible way. Perhaps by provoking a crack\naddict in the early hours of the morning.\nWhat are you like a cheesey pop/rock group\nfrom the 80\u2019s? That\u2019s probably quite mean, but\nwhatever, I detest you all. Peace!\nLeo\nThis week, does\nanyone know what\nthe best (Blackthorn\nexcluded. I\u2019d\nrather drink from\na chunderpuddle)\nalcohol percentage to price ratio of beer in the\nUnion? Reply to Felix editor Jovan Nedic who\nwants to get drunk. Prizes are available in the\nform of a free pint of that beverage.\nTaurus\nThis week you\nwill reaise that\nthat girl you have\nbeen wooing for all\nlast year, working\nyour magic on the\ndance floor and buying all those drinks for\nstill doesn\u2019t know your name. Worse still she\nthinks you\u2019re called Kevin. Might as well fuck\noff me thinks.\nAries\nTrust me on this,\nall the Aries guys/\ngirls absolutely rule!\nYou will almost\ndefinately find your\ntrue love by the end\nof the coming week and even if you don\u2019t you\nwill at least have an interesting moment with a\nflaming hot Filipino homo. You know you love\nthat shiz, you Rice Queen! Give him a try. He\u2019s\ngreat fun, and fits in a suitcase, to boot.\nPisces\nThis month you will\nfall deeply in love\nwith a Fresher. You\nwill dance, sing,\ndrink and chunder\nall over DB\u2019s floor\n(in that order) leaving her not very impressed.\nThen she\u2019ll leave you for a PhD student who\nhas been slightly too close to the Nuclear\nreactor. She\u2019s gone forever, you fucked up bad\nmy friend.\nH to the o, r, o, sizzle copes \u2013 it\u2019s the Horoscopes\nAquarius\nI would like to\npoint out that these\nHoroscopes are\ndefinitly not done\nby a half-pissed\nstudent. Felix takes\npride in the fact that each week a professional\nclairvoyant is kidnapped and in order to write\nthem. Claims that she is then released back in\nto Imperial gen. pop. are unfounded.\nWordoku 1,410\nJ\nS\nA\nH\nO\nE\nM\nE\nS\nN\nV\nN\nO\nE\nE\nN\nO\nM\nS\nV\nS\nH\nM\nV\nO\nE\nE\nV\nS\nO\nWordoku is identical to Sudoku; we\u2019ve just replaced numbers with letters.

This is the first one, therefore\nthere is no winner from last time. Thanks to Chaz for coming up with the words!\nTamara Slutatapova\nH\nello, I am Tamara Slutarapova. The Felix\neditor asked me to help\nguide you through the\ninevitable emotional\nand social disasters of the coming year.\nFor the boys \u2013 to advise you on how\nto woo and secure a decent looking\ngirl at Imperial. I am concerned be-cause, from my personal experience\nof Freshers\u2019 week, your shortcomings\n(ha!) both in conversation and wallet\nsize leave much to be desired. Perhaps\nit is a lost cause and by the end of the\nyear I will have to simply direct you to\nthe nearest art college for easier and\nprettier conquests. For the girls - I will\nhelp as much as I can. You must un-derstand, I struggle to imagine your\nposition. Evidently, you are not pretty\nor generous enough to have secured a\nman before uni. Instead, you have infiltrated the male world in order to capture one off-guard. I look forward to\nreading and empathising as best I can\nwith you over a skinny non-dairy decaf\norganic Fairtrade latte.\nDear Tamara,\nI met a lovely boy in Freshers\u2019 week and\nhe took me to his room to watch Sleepy\nHollow. Everything was going great. So.\nI was really excited about seeing him\nthe next night so I put on a really cute t-shirt from Camden and some sexy jeans\nfrom Topshop. However, when I went to\nhis room, he started acting really funny\nand started getting out trashy underwear that he suggested I wear. What\u2019s\ngoing on?!\nConfused Camden shopper\nDear Confused Camden shopper,\nThis all sounds very familiar to me. I\nused to go out with a hunky-looking\nfootballer until I found some suspenders and crotchless pants (suspiciously\nlabelled \u201cXXL\u201d) and size 13 stilletos.\nI\u2019m not sure which was worse, the stilettos being from Shoe Zone or the fact\nthat my man of the month wore it all on\nweekends. However, perhaps your man\nhas just been picking up bedroom etiquette from Hangman. Any man trying\nto accessorise an outfit with a piece of\nrope is not to be taken seriously.\nDear Tamara,\nInstead of picking up Freshers\u2019 flu, I\nseem to have picked up something of the\nred and itchy variety. What do I do?\nItchy & Scratchy One Man Show\nDear Itchy & Scratchy One Man Show,\nI assume you are a sports player and\nhave participated in Snakebite-fuelled\nincestuous Wednesday night at the\nUnion. You only have a few more days\nwhen you\u2019re contagious so I suggest\nyou call all those girls from school who\nlaughed at your big calculator and airplane magazines and pay them back.\nGood luck and enjoy.\nDear Tamara,\nI was always the best in my school and\nmy teachers had me down to win a\nChemistry Nobel Prize. However, after\na week of Imperial, I ahve realised that\nI will never belong in the front rows of\nthe lecture theatre and never be one of\nthe clever people here. What can I do to\nimprove my self esteem?\nBack Row Fresher\nDear Back Row Fresher,\nYour first year at university is a time to\nbetter yourself and grow as a person.\nYou must concentrate on the more important things in life - your looks and\nyour social status. You will find the two\ngo hand in hand. If you cannot beat\nthe kids sitting in the front rows, show\nthem why they wish they could sit with\nyou in the back rows (but never allow\nthem otherwise it loses its mysterious\nappeal).

Take refuge in Tampopo for some funky fast food.\nWelcome\nFisherites,\nSouthwellians and all new\nEvelyn Garden\ndwellers! You are now\na resident in SW7, surrounded\nby yuppies and may find it daunting\nto venture beyond Sainsbury\u2019s to find\ngrub. But I emplore you, Fresher, to\ntry the fantastic noodle emporium just\naround the corner from halls.\nTampopo is anything you want it to\nbe.

The\nnice people at Tampopo give students\n20% off the whole bill Sunday-Thursday. It\u2019s incredibly good value which\nis a rarity in SW7. Also, takeaways are\non offer if you don\u2019t fancy a restaurant\nenvironment.\nHungry Accomplice and I went down\nto Tampopo the other night.

Choose\na main and accompaniment\nfor \u00a36.95 e.g. Mee Goreng and\nGyoza (dumplings).\nTakeout: Take a look at the menu\non the website, call up and\norder. The restaurant does not\ndeliver but you can pop round\nthe corner to pick it up.\nPrice: Under a tenner per head\nRosie Grayburn\non a Monday night the place was buzzing with a mix of bankers and students\nsharing huge tables, scoffing noodles\nor slurping at soup.\nHungry Accomplice was ravenous\nso we opted for 2 courses. If you are\nfeeling thus, Tampopo do a vast sharing platter with satay, dumplings and\nother tasty morsels\u2026 but a healthier\noption is to share a salad. We shared\nGado Gado, an Indonesian salad. The\negg, al dente veg, fresh tofu and prawn\ncrackers were presented like crudit\u00e9s\ncentered around a bowl of satay sauce.\nThis version was suitable for sharing\nand gave us a real chopstick work out,\nbut I\u2019d have preferred the street food\nversion for shovelling purposes where\nthe whole lot is mushed together and\nsmothered in sauce.\nOur main courses were Chicken Pho\nand Kway Teow. My Pho was Pho-tastic.

You are rushing about,\ncrashing from this induction to that\ninitiation... lectures fit in somewhere.\nIt\u2019s time for fast food. You have to use\nyour loaf.\nToast can be transformed by even the\nbiggest nonce into a scrummy snack or\ndinner. You can use any bread you like:\nbrown, white, seeded, rye, pitta, nan,\nbagel\u2026Have a try of these nutritious\nideas for the simplest and cheapest\ningredients.\nSardines: Toast your bread and butter heavily. Open a tin of sardines in\ntomato sauce and mush with a fork.\nPile on top of the toast and eat. I recommend one tin per slice of bread\nfor greediness. For the more demure\namong you, half a tin per slice. If you\nprefer sardines in oil, give the sardines\na squeeze of lemon before devouring.\nSardines are very very good for you as\nthey contain a lot of omega 3 and essential oils.\nBruschetta: Chop a tomato and season with salt and pepper. Add a dash\nof olive oil and mix. Tip onto our toast\nand VOILA a homemade brushetta!\nIf you have any parsley or basil lying\naround, add that too. Boys \u2013 pay attention to this recipe. Tomatoes contain\nlycopene which is incredibly good for\nyour sperm/your little soldiers.\nFish fingers: Cook 3 fingers of fish as\nper instructions and sandwich between\ntwo slices of toast. Smother in ketchup\nand munch. Bird\u2019s Eye now does a value version of their fish fingers \u2013 HURRAH for student budgets!\nThe alternative bacon sarnie: Fry a\nrasher or two of bacon and add a couple\nof tinned plum tomatoes to the pan to\nwarm through and pick up some of the\njuices from the bacon. Tip the contents\nof the pan onto a slice of toast and add\nanother slice on top. PHWOAR.\nBeans and Egg: Beans, beans, good\nfor your heart: the more you eat them,\nthe more you\u2026 This simple dish of\nbaked beans topped with a poached\negg has been proven to be the cheapest and most nutritious meal you could\npossibly eat! Fibre, protein, carbs.. the\nwhole kaboodle! To poach your egg,\nboil about 2 inches of water in a pan of\nyour choice. Crack the egg carefully in\nthe water so the white doesn\u2019t spread\ntoo much. Turn off the heat and leave\nthe egg to cook for 3 minutes. Scoop\nthe poached egg out of the water and\nplace it on top of your mound of beans\non toast.

It is a fantastically unpretentious place where students are welcomed alongside many of the South\nKensington locals and lost-looking\ntourists. Caf\u00e9 Forum is a traditional\nItalian style caf\u00e9 serving good quality\ncoffees and other hot drinks, freshly\nprepared juices, as well as a host of different delicious snacks. However, in\naddition to this, Caf\u00e9 Forum also acts\nas a brilliant one-stop shop for lunch\ntoo. In addition to its home-made pas-Cafe Forum/House of Coffees\nHHHHH\nGloucester Road\n(Turn right out of the tube\nstation)\nBest: The pizzas.. oh baby\nWorst:Pre-lecture queues in the\nmorning for \u00a31 sausage baguettes and coffee\nHungry Accomplice\ntas and generous salads it also serves\nup those legendary pizzas\nThe pizzas are out of this world. The\nbases are gooey, crunchy and extremely addictive. You choose 4 from a whole\nhost of veggie, meaty or fishy toppings\nand you have the freedom to choose\nyour base size, depending on your appetite (small belly \u00a33.75, medium tummy \u00a34.95, large stomach \u00a35.95). Order\nyou toppings, size and 10 minutes later,\nand perfection is served in front of you.\nAnd if the pizza wasn\u2019t enough, their\ndesserts are tasty too. Try the apple\nstrudel and cream for \u00a33.20.\nThe value for money of this heavenly\ncaff is almost the best bit. Caf\u00e9 Forum\nis very cheap indeed. A HUGE regular\n\u00a31.40 for a cup of sweet, sweet nectar in this quirky little cafe.\ncoffee is freshly prepared for you for\njust \u00a31.40, and you get a free croissant\nwith it in the mornings. If the pizzas\ndon\u2019t take your fancy and you go for a\nsalad, you can get a large bowl of incredibly tasty chicken salad for \u00a33.95.\nSo as you can see the prices are good.\nFor me, Caf\u00e9 Forum was a great post-rugby match destination on a Wednesday evening. However, it offers such\nvariety that it can be what you want \u2013 a\nquick stop for lunch, or a great place\nto sit and chat in the evenings \u2013 all the\npaninis and pastries are reduced after\n11pm.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 10 October 2008 felix\nArts\nEmily Wilson\nArts Editor\nNope, we hadn\u2019t heard of it either\nTimon of Athens is the Shakespeare play most people don\u2019t know about. Caz Knight sees it performed\nT\nimon of Athens made its\nmark on Shakespeare\u2019s\nGlobe this summer despite running alongside\nmany other much more\nwell known, cherished and understood of the Bard\u2019s works. Rarely heard\nof, even among those familiar with\nShakespeare, it is a hot topic for debate\namong the learned as to the date of its\ncreation, its creator(s) and performance circumstances. Scholars are divided on whether or not it was actually\nfinished and whether playwright Thomas Middleton was a collaborator with\nShakespeare on Timon.\nThus, director Lucy Bailey took on a\nchallenge by realising this complex and\nobscure work. In doing so she has managed to present it in a fashion that will\nappeal to audiences with an appetite\nfor digestible summer entertainment.\nAlso described as a \u2018poor relation\u2019 to\nsome of the other major tragedies such\nas Othello, Macbeth and King Lear, this\nplay is described both as a tragedy and\nas a problem comedy despite the death\nof its main character. Set in Athens,\nLord Timon is a popular, wealthy and\ngenerous man bestowing on his loyal\nfriends numerous epicurean banquets\nrank with wine and women. However,\nthe sudden loss of his fortune sees Timon forsaken by his supposed brethren\nand transformed into a misanthrope\nand so he casts himself asunder to live\nlife in rags in the wilderness. Upon discovering hidden treasure he plans an\nassault on the city in a fit of bitterness\ntowards mankind.\nThe play\u2019s negative view on excess,\nexpenditureandmoneyhavemadeitan\nunpopularcandidatewithwealthy,pay-ing audiences in the past and it seems\na little ironic that Timon, rife with the\nnotion of lost riches, is brought to the\nGlobe at this time of economic uncer-tainty. It has also been chastised for its\nlack of any serious female characters\n(bloody feminists). The only women\nto appear in Timon are those fit soley\nfor the sexual whims of the banqueters.\nFor those of you who care, this cast sees\nmany woman in roles besides those of\nthe whores. The production\u2019s fantastic\ndesign team have really outdone any\nprevious performance at the Globe by\na very dynamic and interactive set de-sign. Vulture-like, black-clad demons\ndangle down and pounce upon Timon\nand his friends and scuttle over the\nhuge net which is cast over the theatre\u2019s open roof. The churlish and disgusted philospher, Apemantes, strolls\nthrough the standing audience before\nmaking his presence felt on stage to\nberate Timon for his indulgences. The\nugly notion of greed, juxtaposed with\nthe jocular banquet atmosphere is brilliantly conveyed by calypso drums getting a sinister makeover when played\nover deeper, heavier drums.\nSimon Paisley Day as Timon makes\na stupendous effort in portraying the\nlavish host and carries the play through\nits comic to tragic status by his transformation into the loin-cloth wearing\npessimist. The play has moments of\nlewd hilarity as we see Timon, very\nDip into the life and literary\ngenius of Graham Greene\nCaz Knight introduces us to the British writer who reignited her passion for reading\nN\not since I was a carefree schoolgirl, bereft\nof worry and academic\nburden, have I devoured\nliterature as I have done\nthis summer. My will to read was re-ignited and I have Graham Greene to\nthank for it. Like the great author\u2019s\nname, his books are easy to swallow\nand savour, leaving you with nothing\nbut vivid images. Officially Henry Graham Greene (1904-1991), he was born\nin Hertfordshire and attended a boarding school there where his father took\nover as headmaster. His intense boredom prompted an interest in Russian\nRoulette which, Greene said, helped\nhim to appreciate life and to treat his\ninsufferable boredom which \u201cexpanded like a balloon\u201d inside his head. Aged\n16, he ran away from school to escape\nhis \u201cirrational melancholy\u201d and later\nspent time with a psycho-analyst in\nLondon, a time he described as one of\nthe happiest in his life. He had replaced\nmelancholy with normal unhappiness\nand this, according to Freud\u2019s defini-tion, meant he had been successfully\npsycho-analysed.\nGreene\u2019s exciting and, at times, controversial life has coloured his huge\narray of literary output. Whilst working for Night and Day he caused the\nmagazine to close after writing that 10-year-old Shirley Temple in Wee Willie\nWinkie displayed \u201ca certain adroit co-quetry which appealed to middle-aged\nmen.\u201d His extensive travels to places\nsuch as Mexico, Argentina, Russia, Vietnam, Haiti, Cuba, Sierra Leone and\nall over Europe led him to be recruited\nby MI6, as well as proving useful in\ncreating the often poor, hot, dusty and\ntropical settings (\u201cGreeneland\u201d) of his\nnovels. Like many creative geniuses\nsuch as Beethoven, Van Gogh, William\nBlake and Charles Dickens, Greene\nhad bipolar-disorder, a psychological\ncondition which greatly affected his\nwriting and personal life.\nGreene found his way to my heart by\nserenading me with the political novel,\nThe Quiet American. Re-made into\na film in 2002 with Michael Caine as\nthe protagonist Fowler and Brendan\nFraser as the boyish Pyle, the book is\nset across Indochina, now Vietnam.\nJust back from the tropics of SouthEast Asia myself, I eagerly dove into\nthe sweltering landscape created by\nGreene set in the 1950s just before the\noutbreak of the U.S.A.\u2019s Vietnam deba-cle. Teeming with tales of espionage,\npolitical twists and turns, violence,\naction, smatterings of love and even a\nhappy ending, this work of Greene will\nmake you read until the last sentence\nhas been gobbled up and then have you\nrunning to the bookshop/library/shelf\nfor the next one. And so my summer\ncontinued, with interludes of Joseph\nConrad (Heart of Darkness, Nigger\nof the Narcissus), Leo Tolstoy, a biography on the delectable young Josef\nStalin, before he became the nihilistic,\nbloodthirsty tyrant we all know and\nhate, and The Guardian.\nMy next Greene discovery was unearthed from the bookshelf of my parents\u2019 home, a hardback copy of one\nof his latest works, The Captain and\nthe Enemy (1988). Another one of his\ncompelling political stories, it starts\nout with a young boy\u2019s removal, or\nkidnapping, from boarding school by\nthe Captain to a young woman\u2019s flat in\nCamden Town where he stays through\nhis adolescence until his emergence as\na journalist. The autobiographical allusions are clear and continue as the\nyoung man flies to Panama in search of\nthe Captain, to find that his \u2018father\u2019 is\nmixed up in the dealings of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. Short, even for a\nGreene book, this is another delight\nand can be consumed within a matter\nof hours with ease.\nHis acute ability to conjure setting in\na paragraph taking us to the exact spot\nof the story\u2019s backdrop is seen in The\nMinistry of Fear, reminiscently Orwellian by its greyness. That is not to\nsay that the progression of this fantastic suspense thriller is a bore to read! It\nhas its low moments, as does the life of\nanyone living in (wartime) London, the\nnovel\u2019s setting. Ministry features less\npolitical nuance and more philosophi-You know you\u2019ve made it as a writer when someone makes a film of your work starring Michael Caine and\nBrendan Fraser (here in The Quiet American). Graham was chuffed. Or not so much, what with being dead\ncal ideas, which are explored through\nthe character\u2019s experience of pity and\nresponsibility. I found myself angered\nintensely at Brown\u2019s feeling of responsibility to almost complete strangers,\nat the expense of his happiness as well\nas sharing in Brown\u2019s misery: Greene\nhas succeeded in conveying the intricate thought processes of his charac-ters. This murder mystery, with just\nthe right amount of love story added,\nexplores a wide range of metaphysical\nissues without feeling cumbersome to\nget through.\nOnto Cold War politics in Russia and\nItaly respectively in No Man\u2019s Land and\nA Stranger\u2019s Hand, which are two novellas designed solely as film outlines to\ndevelop characters. Only A Stranger\u2019s\nHand was made into a film. Each is no\nlonger than 50 pages, but once again,\nan extreme sense of place is created as\nwell as a strong connection with the\ncharacters of Brown (not the same as\nin Ministry of Fear: a possible play on\n\u2018Greene\u2019) and his love interest, political\nrefugee, Carla (a play on his then mistress\u2019 name, Catherine). Greene criticised authors such as Virginia Wolf and\nE.M. Forster for the absence of religion\nand faith in their characters which resulted in lifeless and superficial ones.\nGreene believed that to create depth\nhis characters must have some sort\nof religious \u2018element\u2019 in them. Greene\nconverted to Catholicism upon marrying his wife Vivien, although they did\nnot stay married and Greene went onto\nhave many subsequent affairs. In every\nbook I have read of his thus far the religion is consistently present even if it is\na passing reference to a rosary. One of\nthe \u201cCatholic\u201d books, The Heart of the\nMatter, deals with the Head of Police\u2019s\nperdition. Fuelled by his experience in\nSierra Leone during WWII, this book\nis set in Greeneland proper. It is hard\nto finish reading this book and not feel\nas though we too have experienced the\nhammering rains of West Africa; the\ndank humidity punctuated with mosquitoes and the padding of our \u201cboy\u2019s\u201d\nfeet on stone floors. Henry Scobie, like\nBrown in Ministry of Fear, is shackled\nby his pity for his once loved wife, Louise. He yearns for peace and his wish\nis fleetingly granted as Louise departs\nfor South Africa, but returns as he\ntakes a mistress in the form of child\nwidow, Helen. Love quickly turns into\npity, which doubles as Louise returns\nhome. Scobie damns himself by continuing the affair whilst continuing to\ntake communion with Louise at Mass.\nIn the end, through his suicide, he forsakes God at the expense of his soul so\nthat the two women in his life can be\nhappy in a world where he is not. At\ntimes I did not feel positive enjoyment\nreading this book for it is too potent,\ntoo successful in recreating human\nemotion and turmoil: I felt dragged\nalong through the grind of his dam-nation, but came out the other side in\nawe of what Greene has managed to\ndo, again.\nTrue, his novels thus far often follow what I call the \u2018Greene Formula.\u2019\nThis is the appearance of features such\nas Catholic allusions, some small and\nsome the main feature of the novel.\nAnother is the single, troubled but\nsturdy woman with whom the protagonist inevitably falls in love; references\nto English public schools; the protagonist who suffers from pity; sepulchral\nsimiles and fond references to women\u2019s\npowder and other ablutions. One of\nmy favourite lines in any book would\nbe taken from Ministry of Fear, \u201cAll\nthe way upstairs to his room he could\nsmell her. He could have gone into\nany chemist\u2019s shop and picked out her\npowder, and he could have told in the\ndark the texture of her skin.\u201d Brown\u2019s\npassion is so blatant from his attention\nto such a small detail of the woman he\nloves. To the less neurotic mind these\nwould go unnoticed, but as I read the\nbooks in reasonably quick succession\n(Greene wrote them over several dec-ades), I began to see a pattern emerge.\nIt is a credit to his talent that such a\nformula can be reused and can still\nmanage to create works that baffle, are\noriginal and make me feel as if I have\nread much, much more than just one\nauthor over the course of five books.\nGreene certainly is a genius in the\nway he manages to transport one to\nplaces and through experiences with\nrelatively so few words. Quite a contrast to friend and fellow Catholic,\nEvelyn Waugh, author of the Brideshead Revisited institution. I am in\ncomplete agreement when Waugh\nsaid of his friend, \u201cthe words are func-tional, devoid of sensuous attraction.\u201d\nThis is lean, fat-free fiction leaving\nnothing but stark realism; effortlessly\ngood, although one comes out feeling\ngorged, replete as if having feasted on\nthe fatty goodness of Waugh\u2019s sensuous narratives.\nGraham Greene, the man himself, performs the classic \u201cthoughtful intellectual\u201d pose, with added eyebrow\nOk, so, Russian Roulette. Greene was into it but that doesn\u2019t mean we in the Arts pages encourage it Timon of Athens is about an angry caveman apparently\nEarly this morning I found myself lying\nawake thinking about who I am. A little along the lines of those \u201cI am who I\nam because of everybody\u201d adverts by\nOrange, I started to think about what\ndefines me. Those of you readers who\nhave the great misfortune of being\nfreshers have by now probably got sick\nof defining yourself by name, subject\nand where home is. My name\u2019s Emily,\nI study biology, I come from Marlow in\nBuckinghamshire.\nMeanwhile, many third/fourth years\nfaced with the impendingness of life\nafter Imperial might be finding themselves defined by the contents of their\nCV. I worked in a bookshop for two\nyears, I\u2019ve been an Oxfam volunteer,\nI\u2019ve spent a summer as a telemarketer\nand more recently I spent a summer as\na corporate whore.

Relationship sta-tus: married to my best friend (we\u2019re\nclearly not married, really I\u2019m single).\nInterested in: men (oh but I\u2019m married\nto a girl \u2013 what a conflict, tee hee!). Political and religious views: champagne\nsocialist and rampant atheist (I like to\nbe descriptive). And THEN we\u2019re on to\nlists of activities, music and films\u2026 but\nwho cares about that because you\u2019re\nall just judging me on my number of\nfriends anyway.\nMy point, reader, is that this is all\njust the bollocks we put on paper. Sure,\nall the stuff above is true, but how do\nI really define myself? I define myself\nby my habits and my quirks, by what\nI do with my weekends, and by what\nmakes me happy. I like nights out,\nnights in, gigs, but not festivals, sitting\nin pubs with pints of Stella. I\u2019ve drunk\nthree mugs of coffee already today.\nI buy The Guardian every morning.\nI organise my non-fiction books by\nheight of spine. I spend my weekends\nmostly alone and wandering through\nart galleries or around the streets of\nLondon. I have no qualms about going to the cinema solo or sitting alone\nin cafes and eating extravagant cake.\nI like diet coke, but not regular coke.\nI used to have a blog and I created a\nwebcomic that never got online. I hate\nteam sports, but I\u2019ve been to the gym 7\ntimes in the past 9 days.\nWhat\u2019s my point? My point is that\nyou should think about who you are\nwhen you\u2019re not a physicist or a medic\nor captain of the football team.

University\u2019s the place to find out, and the arts\npages here in Felix are a good start.\nForget what might go on your CV or\nwhether it\u2019ll get you more friends on\nFacebook. Try something new. Go to a\nplay, pop into a museum or an art gal-lery, write a poem, read a book. And\nyou know what else?

Such a moment shines\nin a comical sense but momentarily\ndetracts from the dialogue and subject\nmatter: a point made by other critics\nalso in reference to the elaborate set\ndesign.\nWhatever its faults, this highly original and fun production has totally\nshaken Shakespeare up for audiences\nand given them a delightful evening\u2019s\nentertainment in an extremely different theatrical setting while still successful in conveying the play\u2019s themes\nand gravitas.\n\n"

The so\ncalled \u2018daughter-guarding hypothesis\u2019\nsuggests parents have evolved to protect their daughter\u2019s sexual reputation\nand mate-value. The idea is that since\nunwanted pregnancies and rape are\nboth more likely to affect daughters\nthan sons, parents were more likely to\nevolve behaviours that interfere with\ntheir daughter\u2019s sexual activities, to\nprevent such costly mishaps. Now, the\nfirst evidence to support this hypothesis has been published in the Journal\nof Evolutionary Psychology.\nResearchers from the University of\nTexas in Austin asked students and\ntheir parents to fill in questionnaires\nregarding parental behaviours when\nthe students were in senior year at\nhigh school. Both children and parents reported parents having different\nattitudes towards daughters. Daughters were less likely to get permission\nto drive the family car, to go for a ride\nwith a male friend and spend night\nover at a friend\u2019s or a boyfriend\u2019s house.\nThey were also more likely to get a curfew and be frowned upon for holding\nhands, kissing or having sex with their\nboyfriend. Parents, but especially fa-thers, thought it\u2019s more important to\napprove of their daughter\u2019s boyfriends\nthan of their son\u2019s girlfriends. Parents\nwere more likely to control what their\ndaughter is wearing. The list goes on...\nIn effect, all those girls who feel their\nbrother gets away with stuff they would\nnever manage is probably right.

Among other things, Sir John is\nbehind the emergence of negative refraction \u2018metamaterials\u2019, in which light\nrays entering a material are refracted\non the same side of the normal.\nMaterials can be constructed which\nsweep light around objects and hence\nmakes them undetectable. This application created international media\nfrenzy, captivating the public\u2019s interest and it even ended up in the Sun\nwith the title \u2018Boffin invents invisibility\ncloak\u2019.\nThe BBC was closer to the mark\nwith their headline \u2018Invisibility cloak\n\u2018step closer\u2019\u2019 as the cloaking technology is currently limited to a narrow\nfrequency band and therefore making\nanything disappear completely in the\nvisible is currently unfeasible.\nHowever these metamaterials are\nalready being applied to other areas.\nSpecial constructions of these materials can even focus light into areas\nsmaller than their wavelength, which\ncould break the current 60Gb storage\nlimit on Blu-Ray devices. As Sir John\nsays \u201cUsing conventional materials we\ncan\u2019t go any further - however, negative\nmaterials can beat this fundamental\nlimit.\u201d\nIn another application, Boeing have\nalready made prototype antennae out\nof negative refractive material, where\nthe material\u2019s ability to respond to a\nparticular frequency is actually a particular strength.\nSir John turned 65 this year and to\ncelebrate his wide ranging contributions to science over 40 years, Imperial\norganized the aptly named \u2018Pendryfest\u2019.\nHe has had a hand in shaping Imperial\nin his time here; by building the condensed matter group, as head of the\nPhysics Department and later Principal of the Physical Sciences Faculty. In\nrecent years he has refocused on his research away from administration with\na prestigious EPSRC Senior Research\n5-Year Fellowship. Over his career he\nhas made fundamental contributions\nto three major fields of Physics - surface science, disordered systems and\nlocalization,andmetamaterialsworkin\noptics. Although he just turned 65, he\nhas no intention of slowing down and I\nam happy to say that with his work on\ntime reversal about to be published in\nScience, we could one day celebrate his\n65th birthday once again.\nIn the words of Sir Peter Knight who\nchaired a session at Pendryfest, \u201cOne\nof the things that is characteristic and\nunusual about John is that every few\nyears he changes his field. So you can\npoint to about four different John Pendry\u2019s and in each case he has made a\nworld class contribution. At conferences there are whole sessions devoted\nto subjects where John had the first\nword. So his international leadership\nhas been phenomenal.\u201d\nLifting the veil on the man who developed the invisibility cloak.\nDaniel Burrows\nScience Editor\n25 days from now, America will choose\nthe next president of the United States.\nBoth sides tout \u2018change\u2019, but there is a\nchoice as to the nature of the change:\nbetween youth and experience, between Ivy League education and an\nAmerican war hero and, frankly, between black and white. Putting all\nother differences aside, how would a\nMcCain administration differ from\nan Obama administration on science?\nScienceDebate2008 is a non-partisan\ngroup which asked the contenders 14\npressing science questions to find out.\nObama says science and technology\nwill be a \u2018central priority\u2019 and promises\nto double basic research budgets over\nthe next decade including increasing\nsupport for \u2018high-risk, high-payoff\u2019\nresearch. He promises a hands on approach with the creation of 30,000 new\nteachers in high-need schools.\nWhereas, McCain seems to prefer a\nmore \u2018hands-off\u2019 approach. He promises to streamline government regula-tions, lower taxes, provide incentives to\nresearch, but stops short of promising\na general cash figure. He does promise a few \u2018green\u2019 specifics including two\nbillion dollars every year for the next\n15 years on clean coal technologies,\n$5,000 tax credit for each zero emission car, and a $300 million prize for\nthe development of a novel battery.\nSo does McCain win the green science debate? Well Obama proposes\nan 80% reduction in Carbon emissions\nby 2050 (as opposed to McCain\u2019s 60%)\nand Obama includes annual reduction\ntargets. They both believe in \u2018cap and\ntrade\u2019 schemes; however Obama talks\nmore about bringing the other major\nemitters of the world, China, Europe,\nand India to the table with a technology transfer program.\nNo so very different I hear you say,\nbut McCain and Obama do differ significantly on their attitude on stem cell\nresearch. McCain talks incorrectly and\nemotively about \u2018fetal farming\u2019, whereas Obama promises to immediately\nlift President Bush\u2019s ban on embryonic\nstem cell research which has been a\n\u2018hand-cuff\u2019 on researchers.\nMoreover if McCain wins we are one\n72 year-old\u2019s heartbeat from swearing\nin President Sarah Palin. On climate\nchange she says \u2018I\u2019m not one though\nwho would attribute it to being manmade\u2019. She does not believe in abor-tion, even in the case of rape. She is a\n\u2018proponent of teaching\u2019 both evolution\nand creationism together in schools.\nAnd my decision is made.\nDaniel Burrows\nI thought Pendryfest was fantas-tic, as I could follow many of the\ntalks even as a non-specialist.\nWhat were your thoughts?\nWell I was looking forward to it, but\nwith some apprehension because it\u2019s a\nbig thing - having your old friends and\ncolleagues come back is a very emotional experience.\nIn the end, it was a wonderful occa-sion. It was a hell of a lot of organisation and I am very grateful to all those\nat college helped organize it including\nProf Adrian Sutton and Carolyn Dale.\nYou have held a number of important posts throughout your career\n(see article), how have you managed to continue to do research\nwhile still being the heads of\nthese large organizations?\nI am a fiend when it comes to rationing\nmy time. I had to cut my immediate\ngroup down to 2-3 students and a post\ndoc, so the administration was very\nlight. They had to be very good people\nwho could propel themselves for long\ndistances under their own steam.\nAnd of course, the number of really\ngood sparks of inspiration you have in\na year is quite limited. Einstein had a\nlot but not all in one day and so there\nis a lot of space in-between. Something\nis happening, but it is not happening in\nthe frontal part of the brain.\nSay you just graduated from\nImperial College, knowing what\nyou know now from all the senior\nposts you have held, what field\nwould you choose?\nThat is a difficult question. I can tell\nyou I ended up in condensed matter\nPhysics by accident. Like most of my\ncontemporaries, I wanted to do something in cosmology and general rela-tivity. I actually messed up my finals\nand ended up with a 2:1, which was not\ngood enough to do cosmology. A condensed matter theorist took pity on me\nand so I guess it was an accident. Since\nthen, I have moved fields a few times,\nso my current field of optics is definitely an informed choice. Optics is a mature field of course, but there are new\nthings happening all the time.\nAnd another thing: you cannot listen\nto a lecture and say that is jolly interest-ing. I would like to do research in that\nfield. Listening to the Brandenburg\nConcertos is interesting, but we should\nnot all take up composing. You have\ngot to feel that you are using your skills\nand therefore earning your keep.\nAbout computers in 1969: you\nwrote computer simulations,\nbut there weren't any computers\naround then right? As we know it\nanyways...\nOh, well we had tape and then later\npunch cards. The first machine I\nworked on was punch tape - you could\npunch the holes yourself if you wanted\nto change a few things. There were\ncompilers but no code libraries, so\nwhen I worked with problems involving matrixes, inverting them, diagonal-izing them and so on, we had to write\nall our own subroutines for analysis.\nThroughout your career you have\nmoved fields every 12 years or\nso. The first was an accident, and\nthe optics was a choice. Do you\nthink these things happen more\nby accident or more by choice in\nyour career?\nThere is an immense amount of luck\nand accident in it. It is always important to realize that whatever you are\nworking on, in 10 years time it is likely\nnot to be the hot topic of the day. Planning to move on is an essential part of\ncareer training for a scientist. The way\nI work is I have one main problem I\nam focussed on and then I have other\nproblems, like little vortices which cast\noff and go somewhere else. A few of\nthem will grow into the next project\nso all the time I am reading around my\nsubject. And remember science is a bit\nlike Wall Street, it has its successes and\ndisasters just like Wall Street does.\nIf you are sensible you choose to go\nin a direction in which you can bring\nsome skills with you. Otherwise you\nare back as a PhD student learning everything from scratch.\nThere was a throw away comment in the recent article about\nyou in the Physics review letters,\nwhich really sparked my interest.\nIt said in the disordered systems\nand localisation work you were\ndoing particularly with Prof Angus MacKinnon, there might be\napplications with the conductivity of bio-molecules. Could you\nexplain a bit more about this?\nWell yes... I do know what they are talking about... and I think they are wrong!\nThings like silicon can come in highly\nordered crystals. But bio-molecules are\nnot like that. For example DNA, perhaps the ultimate bio-molecule, cannot\nhave ordered stacking of the base pairs.\nSo it can be modelled a little bit like a\ndisordered system, which is a very difficult problem which I worked on with\nAngus and it\u2019s not solved today.\nWould you be interested in working in that field... or are you on\nMeta-materials right now?\nIt\u2019s very frustrating. Angus gave me\na backhanded compliment in his talk\n(at Pendryfest) on this point. He said\nI did some good work on it but it was\nignored, as it did not fit in with the\nfashions of the times. I was very cross\nabout my work on disordered systems\nand now, twenty years later, people are\ndoing experiments based on things we\ndid then. I would like to get back and\npick up that thread, but I'm on meta-materials right now and this is so productive that is what I must focus on.\nYour work on metamaterials has\ncaptivated both scientists and\nnon-scientists alike. The invisibility cloak has been talked about in\nthe pub and scientists have been\namazed at the perfect lens, but\nwhat I want to talk about is the\napplication to antennae?\nYes, I think that antennae is the meta-material area where companies may\nmake the first products. It is easier to\nmake metamaterials that operate in\nthe frequency range and the range of\nmaterial properties available at those\nfrequencies is much greater than the\nrange of materials available at optical\nfrequencies.\nWhat do you think about the\npublic's view on Physics?\nI think all too often it\u2019s associated with\nthe areas where it carries the technology all the way through to application,\nlike the military ones: radar and the\nnuclear bomb. People often don't see\nthe physics as the essential engine under the hood of major advances.\nFor example the endoscope was invented by Harold Hopkins, who was a\nprofessorofOpticsatImperial. Herealized that light entering a fibre, mapped\nexactly to a point of light on the other\nend, and it did not matter how the fibre\nbends in the middle. This is probably\nthe single most important advance in\nmodern surgery. Many abdominal operations do more damage getting to the\nproblem then fixing it. There are now\na host of operations you can walk away\nfrom, where previously there would be\nweeks of convalescing and potential for\ncomplications. It\u2019s all thanks to keyhole\nsurgery and Harold Hopkins.\nThis has impacted my life, I had\nkeyhole surgery to remove my\nappendix and I walked out of the\nhospital about three hours later.\nThese are the stories we should be\ntelling about Physics, Physics as the\nGood Samaritan to the other sciences.\nI would like more school children to see\nPhysics like that, as a living science.\nYou have never diverged into\nstarting a company? Have you\never been tempted?\nThe problem with a start-up, is that it\nis very expensive on time and it is not\nmy expertise. As a theorist, even one\nwho works closely with experimental-ists, I am used to generating ideas, but\nthen you have to build on those and get\na piece of kit. This kit is the thing that\nis patented and forms the bases of a\ncompany\u2019s worth. So you are at an immediate disadvantage as a theorist.\nAt the end of the day you might have\nsomething very valuable, which you\ncan sell and make a lot of money. I then\nhave to ask, what would I do with it?\nIf I was a young man with a family to\nsupport I might think differently, but\nas it is, I don't.\nIts been 10 years, have you decided which field is next?\nI am building a link between the time\nreversal and negative refraction. Negative refraction is like a bit of negative\nspace and time reversal sends things\nbackwards in time. Could they be\nrelated?\nI am sure that will capture some\nmedia interest too!\nWell that would be fun. It will make a\nnice change from the cloak I must say.\nObama vs. McCain\n\u201cHis international\nleadership\nhas been\nphenomenal\u201d\n\n"

We could only be shifted\nwith Tom Sutherland\u2019s solemn promise of +2000 metre climbs and high\nspeed descents through the Pyrenees\nin Southern France.\nAnd so last August boats were switched\nfor bicycles and oars replaced with\npedals, all disassembled and loaded\ninto the mini-bus for the long drive to\nthe picturesque village of Luz-St-Sauveur for some tough pre-season cross\ntraining.\nThe first four days were spent ascending and descending the surrounding terrain including past Tour de\nFrance climbs such as the infamous\nHautacam. Road signs are placed at\nevery kilometre mark detailing the distance to the summit and the average\ngradient until the next sign. Conditions\nwere misty intially, veiling what must\nhave been spectacular views resulting\nin chilling conditions at high altitudes.\nLess steely-nerved cyclists were nursing their hand cramps and requiring a\nchange of more than just brake blocks\nafter particularly steep descents. A\nminor respite on day 4 ensued with a\nvist to Lourdes and a brief stop-off at\nLac de Lourdes where Winny, who gets\nvery distracted when within a five mile\nradius of a lake, and his speedos, made\ntheir first of many appearances.\nOn day 5 basecamp was shifted and\nthe route for the day involved climbing\nand descending the highest mountain\nroad pass in the Central Pyrenees: Col\ndu Tourmalet towering at 2115m. The\nclimb to the peak is 19km from Luz St.\nSaveur with an average gradient of 7.4%\nand reaching 10.2% near the summit.\nRegrouped at the peak we realised this\nwas only as high as the road went. We\nhad to get to the very top. And touch\nit. Bikes were ditched and after an hour\nof hiking we arrived at Observatoire du\nPic du Midi de Bigorre at 2877m.\nBen Anstiss and I were less than enthused about the lake that Winny had\nearmarked for a swim on the way up,\nand so we inadvertently smuggled our\nway down on the ski lift ending up\non a different mountain, and having\nto hitch our way back to the bicycles.\nICBC Own Pyrenees on Cycling Camp\nWith bicycles and cyclists reunited, a\nspeedy descent left the troops at the\nfoot of yet another mountain, and after\nclimbing Col d\u2019Aspin it wasn\u2019t long until arrival, albeit destroyed, at the chalet in Estarvielle.\nTaking advantage of fatigue and the\nlack of an ability to think rationally,\nWinny managed to convince Chewy\n(Rachael Davies) and Nick Ablitt to join\nhim the following day after excitedly\nspotting yet another lake on the map.\nWill Todd had already annouced his\nundying love for Winny and would not\nbe parted so the foursome headed off\nin high spirits the following morning.\nAfter cycling beyond Col du Peyresourde, the road ended turning into a\nsteep and rough track. Lac de Borderes\nou de Bareilles was the destination,\nand while other professional climbers\nstruggled with hiking boots and climbing sticks, our four heroes, donned in\nlycra and flip-flops, shoulder pressed\ntheir bicycles to the summit.\nWill and Winny suddenly saw the\nlake and although in a state of near\nhypothermia they did what they had\ncome to do. Then the eyes of both\nwere opened, and they knew that they\nwere naked; and they sewed fig leaves\ntogether and made themselves aprons.\nWell sort of\u2026 they got dressed again.\nFueled by carefully rationed cereal\nbarsandonlyahandfulofraisinscondi-tions continued to worsen and morale\nwas low. Hallucinations started kicking\nin after surviving a viscous bull attack,\nsome dangerous stumbles and the sudden drop in temperature resulting in\nan emotionally broken Chewy asking a\ndistant rock to take their photograph.\nTop navigation from Nick eventually\nbrought the crew safely home. It was,\napparently, \u2018Epic\u2019 and the saga was relived over and over and over, and over\nagain during the drive home in the\nmini-bus. Which we couldn\u2019t get out of\nfor 17 hours. Sigh.\nMeanwhile back at basecamp it was\nBBQ night. The girls & Ben prepared\nthe food while the boys stood around\nprodding the coals and discussing the\nbest method of ignition. Sargeant Iain\nPalmer assumed control of the cooking\nand soon burgers, kebabs and sausages\nwere being savaged. It was approaching\ndarkness when our four very exhausted\nadventurers made their way back to the\nchalet, who were only too delighted to\nbe bombarded by fireworks upon their\narrival.\nFollowing a tough week on the legs\nit was with great relief that the local\nlake were offering canoe rentals and\nwe could give the quads a rest on our\nfinal evening and get some upper body\nworkouts. But they were too expen-sive, so we got pedalos instead. After\nrepeatedly nailing each other up and\ndown the lake we finally but briefly relaxed to catch a few rays.\nThe minibus was on call all week\nfor those finding themselves or their\nbikes broken half-way up a mountain.\nLuckily there were no emergencies\nwith only a few punctures and a broken gear cable reported over the week.\nThanks to all our drivers who helped\nout. Praise is well due to svelte athletes\nClarice Chung and George Addams for\ntheir ability to tear over the mountains\nin impressive style.\nOther noteworthy cyclists were John\nDavey who \u2018owned\u2019 himself all week\nand Tom Sutherland, who not only organised the entire week and planned\nthe routes but showed impressive\nendurance covering as many cols as\npossible.\nAching and sunburned, but fit as fid-dles, we celebrated a very successful\ntrip upon our return to London.\nChristina Duffy\nICBC Press Officer\nFollowing on from the success at the\nBUSA Regatta in May, the Boat Club\nqualified 5 crews for the European Universities Rowing Championships held\nin Zagreb over the last week of August;\nthe Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Lightweight\nDouble Sculls, Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s\nLightweight Quadruple Sculls and a\nWomen\u2019s Pair. However, due to logistical issues and increasing costs, only\na small women\u2019s squad made the journey to Croatia with Head Coach Steve\nTrapmore leading the way and hoping\nto inspire us all to victory with tales of\nhow he stroked the GB eight to Olympic glory.\nArriving late Tuesday afternoon,\nthere was just enough time for a quick\ntour of the rowing lake and its associated nudist beaches before settling\ninto our home for the next few days,\nthe student halls of Zagreb University.\nTheir kitchens had clearly been well\nbriefed and were over-zealously plying us with large amounts of pasta,\npotatoes and mystery meat. However,\nwith the weigh-in imminent, the lightweights were left to indulge in some of\nSlimfast\u2019s finest products whilst everyone else tucked into their 4 course\nmeals.\nWednesday morning saw us rising\nearly for a paddle to make the most of\nthe cooler temperatures. This was, in\ntheory, a good idea but it did leave us\nwith nothing to do all afternoon. With\nthe sun beating down on us and boredom setting in quickly, Steve had no\noption but to agree to our demands of\na trip into town after lunch.\nAnd so off we headed for the delights\nof the Botanical Gardens for a relaxing\nafternoon, or so we thought. No sooner had we driven our way through the\npedestrian zone in the centre of town\nand managed to park when Chewy\nrealised that she\u2019d misplaced her bag\n(complete with wallet and passport).\nIt dawned on us that this was a regular occurrence and that she would be\nICBC Women Represent GB\nthreatened with investigation by the\nPassport Office and that we really\nshould try and relocate her bag. It was\nalso at this point, that Chewy chose to\nremind us that she was about to go to\nCambodia to \u2018look\u2019 after orphans for 2\nmonths \u2013 we wish them luck.\nThursday saw the start of racing\n(heats or race for lanes) and the horror that is the sweat-run for the light-weights. We piled on the layers and\nran and ran and ran, eventually making weight just over an hour before\nour race. Without sufficient time to re-cover, our race was unsurprisingly not\ngreat, but we managed to stay within 2\nlengths of the winning Polish crew.\nClaire and Chewy were then supposed to race the Lwt double but the\nprospect of 5 weigh-ins (and hence 5\nsweat runs) in 3 days was too much\nto bear and the decision was made to\nscratch the doubles entry and focus our\nefforts on winning the Quads. The race\nofficials, however, weren\u2019t so keen on\nus pulling out of the race, until Chewy\nfaked near-death and got the medical\nteam to declare her unable to race that\nafternoon\u2026\nThe pair of Jenny and Erica raced\nwell, putting up a good fight for second\nplace but were unfortunate to be overtaken coming into the last 500m.\nThere was no racing scheduled for\neither of our crews on Friday, so it was\nall about the pre-lunch nap, the afternoon snooze and the post-paddle kip.\nOh and there was a little bit of loitering\nabout coffee-shops playing the \u2018pointing\u2019 game. Which actually involves no\npointing at all. Don\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t get it\neither.\nThe Quad\u2019s Final was on Saturday\nmorning so it was another early start\nas we set about our last-minute weight\nloss, which can be summarised as: put\non every bit of kit you own, maybe a\nplastic bag if you\u2019re really desperate,\nrun, strip down and check weight, put\nhorrible, damp, stinky kit back on,\nrun\u2026. repeat as many times as neces-sary. It is as much fun as it sounds. Steve briefly contemplated documenting\nthe joys of the sweat run then common\nsense got the better of him and decided\nthat it wasn\u2019t worth risking his life angering the hungry dehydrated skinnies\nby sticking a camera in their faces. Oh\nand it would seem that in most other\ncountries, their lightweights actually\nare light and don\u2019t do the whole \u2018sweat\noff 2 kg in 2 hours\u2019 thing. In fact, they\nthink it\u2019s just silly!\nHaving learnt from our previous\nrace, the quad got off to a good start\nand were leading coming into the 500m\nmark, much to the surprise of Stevie\nT. However, that wasn\u2019t to last much\nlonger as the neater bladework of the\nPolish crew took them past and onto\na 2 length winning margin over us and\nthe 3rd placed Italian crew a further 2\nlengths behind.\nIt was then time for us to indulge in\na much deserved lunch to celebrate the\nend of a 3 month diet with cake o\u2019clock\nlasting well into the afternoon, whilst\nwe waited for the Pair\u2019s final. They\nraced hard all the way and were challenging for the Silver medal at half way\nbut were eventually worn down by a\nbigger, more experienced crew.\nDrinking commenced in earnest after dinner to prepare ourselves for the\nEuro-pop that we would have to endure\nat the \u2018Athletes\u2019 party\u2019. Having sent our\nintrepid Captain off in search of some\nwine, we joined the Glasgow boys for\na few games of 21, which resulted in a\nlot of love being declared for Dr Nigel\n\u2018Killer\u2019 Atkins (former Glasgow now IC\ncoach) and a bit of nakedness.\nA bucket of mystery alcohol (with a\nhint of Lucozade sport) made a surprise\nappearance with its bearer proudly announcing that he\u2019d \u2018pimped out one of\nthe IC girls to a Polish guy for a bottle of cheap red wine\u2019. Said Polish boy\nturned out to be persistent\u2026 far too\npersistent in claiming his wares. Much\nto my embarrassment and the amuse-Clarice Chung\nImperial College Boat Club\nAs the rest of College slept soundly\nthrough their final night of term, one\nintrepid band of sportsmen set out early on a quest to make Imperial proud.\nBy lunchtime they were waiting in a\ntraffic jam of what turned out to be\nparked cars and driving the wrong way\nround the Paris ring road.\nWe met at 7am, with enough methyl-atedspiritsinourhandluggagetoexcite\neven the most sedate sniffer dog, and\nproceeded to smuggle our cooking apparatus through Eurostar security. We\nwere headed towards Le Mans, France,\nhome of the famous 24 Hour Touring\nCar and Motorbike races, where we\nwere to compete against 6000 fellow\nskaters in one of the biggest amateur\nskating events in the world.\nThe race takes place on the actual Le\nMans circuit, with skaters sleeping and\neating the pit lane. We had arrived the\nday before and camped in a field overlooking the course, preparing both\nmentally and physically for the gruelling challenge ahead of us by eating\nburnt burgers and drinking.\nThe following morning was spent\nperusing the various skating stalls and\ndisplays while being accosted by various larger than life skating Duracell\nbunnies (the not-so-subtle sponsor of\nLe Mans 24 Hour Skate 2008\nIan Beer the event). At 2pm we were let in to\nthe track to set up our space in the pits\nunderneath the stands. Those same\ngarages you see F1 mechanics spilling\noil in were now full of blow-up beds,\nchocolate croissants and skaters discussing team tactics.\n24 hours is a long time to skate, and\nwhile some will inevitably attempt to\ndo it alone without a break, we had different plans: We had decided to organise ourselves into a shift pattern with\ntwo groups. We would all race together\nduring the day, taking one lap each at\na time, but during the night we would\ntake a rest with one group of us taking\na well-deserved 4 hours uninterrupted\nsleep while the others raced on with\nmore frequent laps, swapping over\nabout 4am.\nThe rules of the race were simple;\nthree categories (Singles, Duos and\nTeams) of competitor all skate on the\nsame track in a relay fashion. Those\nwith the most laps after 24 hours win!\nThe course provides excellent skat-ing, 4.2k with a wonderful smooth surface (a welcome change from our London training). As you left the pits there\nwas a fairly steep 600m climb before a\nvery tight downhill corner, which the\npros would take tucked over with their\nchin almost on their knees while some\nof the less experienced skaters struggled to stay upright at all! Rochelle was\nforced to employ a rather novel braking\ntechnique, but there were medical staff\nclose on hand! From there you opened\non to a series of smooth turns and long\ngentle straights back to the start.\nThe race began at 3pm with clas-sification, a short 300m sprint to allocate your team a place along the\nstarting area, much like in the Racing\ncar equivalent. We managed a healthy\nmid-field placing and Josh was chosen\nto race the first lap while those of us\nfurther down the order climbed the\nstands to watch.\nTo start the race everyone found their\nallotted position along the start-finish\nstraight, put their unbuckled skates on\none side of the track and walked to the\nother. When the starting orders were\ngiven they then had to sprint barefoot\nacross to their skates, put them on and\nskate off as quickly as possible. The\nreal pros were able to skate off with\nunfastened skates, waiting for the first\ndescent to tighten them, while others\nvalued their ankles a little more and\ndecided it might be better to tie them.\nOnly a couple of our team had done\nthis sort of skating before, it was up to\nthe rest of us to learn the techniques\nand etiquette from others as we raced\nround the track. As in cycling, swimming and even running you can gain\nan enormous advantage by racing in\nsomeone else\u2019s slipstream. In skating this is taken to the extreme, with\ngroups of up to 10 skaters all racing in\ntight formation, each crouching down\nin an aerodynamic tuck position and\ngrabbing hold of the person in front\nfor the corners. After a few laps we\nrealised that the way to get fast times\nwas not purely by skating hard, but by\nbeing able to latch on to one of these\n\u2018pacelines\u2019 as they are known. There\nwas no hope of keeping up with the\nlycra-clad teams, who were completing\nlaps in under 7 minutes, but there were\nplenty of slower lines which formed\nand disbanded all round the course.\nUnfortunately, this has its price: since\nyou had to be skating fast enough to\njoin any paceline which might pass\nyou with a short effort, you always ran\nthe risk of starting one yourself, where\nsomeone may latch on to you and you\nhave to drag them around the whole\ncourse with no help at all!\nHaving worked this out a competition emerged between the faster skaters in our team to see if we could break\nthe elusive 9 minute lap. This may not\nsound like much, but we had all spent\nthe last month revising in the library\nand may have let our intensive training\nschedule slip slightly. After an tough\nfew hours, and more than his fair share\nof the communal chocolate, Ian did finally manage it after 7 or so laps with a\ntime of 8:52.\nAs we slowly approached the 20th\nhour things were starting to get tough!\nThe feet preparation rituals were getting more and more involved (carbon\nspeed skates are not designed to be\neither the least bit comfortable nor to\nbe worn for 24 hours) and our Vaseline\nand blister plaster supplies were getting low. Some of the team had decided\nto call it a day and we decided to let the\nfaster skaters take more frequent laps.\nDown to 40 minute rotations now\nthere was just enough time for a 10\nminute nap and another croissant before forcing your feet back into the\nskates and limping back to the track!\nAs the clock ticked ever closer to\n4pm things started to get tense for the\nment of all others present, I turned out\nto be the object of his affections. Even\nstern words from Erica (practising her\nbest Terminator look) and Stevie T\npretending to be my dad (!?) and slapping him with his gold medal did nothing to dent his determination and I was\nforced to make an early retreat to bed.\nJudging from the sore heads and feet\nthe next morning, I gather that a good\ntime was had by all.\nIt was a highly enjoyable and successful week of racing with IC being\nthe only squad where every member\nwon a medal and the lightweight quad\nwere also the highest placed British\ncrew, winning the only silver medals.\nMany thanks to Stevie T for not only\norganising everything, securing substantial sponsorship which allowed us\nto go on this trip but also for a sterling\neffort looking after us all and dealing\nwith all the hunger-induced tantrums\nfrom the Lwts.\nteams at the top who were tied on laps.\nThe final rounds had to be taken by\nthe same person, traditionally waving\ntheir flag behind them and treating the\nlast laps as more of a procession than a\nrace, the top teams however continued\nsprinting right down to the bitter end.\nBeing tied on laps it was down to the\nfirst over the line after the 24 hour bell\nhad rung.

Great. After trawling\nthrough the packed stands\nof Imperial\u2019s Fresher\u2019s Fair\n2008, I have come to an\ninevitable conclusion: I am the wrong\ngender.\nIt\u2019s not a case of me wanting a sex-change operation, I\u2019m actually very\nhappy being female, despite starting at\na male-dominated university just over\none year ago. However, during my time\nhere, it has become increasingly clear\nthat Imperial simply cannot cater towards the needs of its female (not necessarily more feminine) students. This\ncase with the razor serves to emphasise\nan unhappy truth\nThe fact is, with the rare exception,\nwomen are not interested in gaming,\nporn, gadgets, expletives, alcohol-induced vomit, or sexual innuendos \u2013\nneed I really continue? Women are not\nobjects for male sexual gratification;\nwe are thinking individuals who should\nbe treated with respect.\nI have in mind here the inappropriate subject matter that was printed in\nlast week\u2019s edition of Felix. For our new\nfreshers starting at Imperial, this is a\ndisastrous first impression.\nWhen \u2018writers\u2019 such as\nHaxz0rMcRandy_1 have such absurd\npre-conceived ideas about women,\nit is no surprise that sexism remains\nrampant even now, in our modern\ntwenty-first century society. The majority of male students at Imperial are\ndecent individuals, who should not allow themselves to be represented by\nsuch misogynistic, ignorant, immature\njournalistic filth. Here we are, studying\ntogether at an innovative, forward-thinking university \u2013 and our student\npaper airs views that belong to the\nDark Ages.\nDoes this writer really expect women to prostrate themselves before\nhim, dressed in the lingerie he has so\nthoughtfully picked out for them, sobbing with gratitude?\nWhen female students chose to study\nat a prestigious academic institution\nlike Imperial, they probably weren\u2019t\nexpecting to read about jibes on how\nto dress!\nEnough is enough. It is time for the\nsilent majority to make itself known.\nWrite into felix now. Make your voice\nheard.\nSusie Peng\nThe XX factor\nWith help from: Vicky Edwards, Chris Woolley, Katharina Reeh, Clarissa Poh, Ei\nMun Chuah and Drew Thomas\nThe Editor\nE\nrm, so there have been a few\ncomplaints about the Hangman section. As well as the\ncomment article above by\nSusie Peng et al. I received\nan email from Chao Cui:\n\u2018I would like to bring to your attention the Hangman article in the latest\nissue of Felix, having read the article\nI am sorry to say that I am appalled\nand offended by the content which is\ndemeaning and inappropriate even if it\nwere meant as a joke. It is unacceptable\nfor a respectable publication, to knowingly adopt the view of women being an\nobject. This also the first felix publica-About Coffee Break and Hangman\ntion that freshers are likely to see, by allowing this article to go to print what\nimage of the college would this project\nto them? Do you think it\u2019s correct to allow a former Guardian Media Group\nStudent News Paper of the Year to fall\nto such low standards?\nI insist that the name of the author\nbe made public, and that both he and\nthe Felix Editor, Jovan Nedic make a\nformal apology to the entire student\ncommunity at Imperial College, and\na guarantee that no further articles of\nthis nature be allowed to go to print.\nSuch an article does the college no good\nwhatsoever, and merely serves to tarnish our reputation.\nIf you\u2019re response is unsatisfactory I\nwill consider taking this matter beyond\nImperial College Union.\n\u2019\nI feel that I really need to explain the\nHangman and Coffee Break sections to\nall of you. In 2006 (same time we won\nthe Guardian Award!) Coffee Break\nwas the satirical section, which also\nincluded fun games and competitions.\nHangman is merely an extension of the\nsatirical part of Coffee Break. Everything that is written in there is meant\nto be taken with a pinch of salt and to\nbe read in good humour. The writing\nin last week\u2019s Hangman was crude and\nblunt, and I apologise for that. In the\nfuture I will not allow that tone to be\nprinted. I have made my views clear to\nthe Hangman team and I am sure that\nthe section will be brought back up to\nstandard.\nI apologise for the way the article by\nHaxz0rMcRandy_1 was written, however I have no reason to apologise for\nthe theme of that particular article.\nLike I said, it is meant to be satirical.\nSome people will like it, others won\u2019t.\nAs for the comment piece by Susie\nPeng et al.

    "content": "22 felix Friday 10 October 2008\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n23\nFriday 10 October 2008 felix\nrobeat producers have taken advantage\nof the fact we all own a mobile phone\nto create a live voting system whereby\nyou text your three favourite countries\nLive from Bosnia and Herzegovina\nLucy Harrold joins \u201chomos and hen nights\u201d for Eurovision-based fun, frolicks, fisting and a singing turnip\nA\ns I entered the theatre,\nnot even having a ticket\nat that time, I was greeted\nby smiley men urging me\nto take a badge and a barrage of women who looked like rejects\nfrom the Claire\u2019s Accessories bargain\nbin advising me my night would not be\ncomplete without a flag or a clacker or\na strange glowing hooter. Once I finally\ngot my ticket and found my seat I began to feel rather apprehensive about\nthe evening, not helped by the sounds\nof said clackers and strange glowing\nhooters, and people generally shouting at each other. My companion, Dale,\nand I both agreed this would be a night\nat the theatre unlike any other as we\ncompared the countries we would be\nrepresenting according badges given at\nthe door; I had Sweden and my friend\nhad Italy.\nI don\u2019t know why I chose Sweden, I\nguess it has something to do with my\nlove for Ikea, meatballs and ABBA\n(but NOT Mamma Mia, if any of you\nmention that film I will not be happy).\nI have always loved Eurovision and so\nwanted to see if this \u201cAlmost Eurovision\u201d would live up to the reality and\nmy friend, although a fan of musical\ntheatre, had never been impressed by\nEurovision so needed to be converted\nto this most tacky of art forms.\nSo far so much like a night at the un-ion, but as the curtain raised to reveal\nthe stage, crammed with as much glitter as is humanly possible, I realised\nperhaps this won\u2019t be so bad after all.\nThen our hosts for the evening entered:\nBoyka, an ex-Olympic pole vaulter\ncum lifestyle programme presenter\nplayed by the hilarious Mel Giedroyc,\nand Sergei, a children\u2019s TV presenter\nplayed by Les Dennis and his hilarious\ntoupee. This set up was all to make us\nbelieve we were part of the audience\nfor the Eurovision Song Contest taking\nplace in Sarajevo, Serbia-Montenegro\nand it worked! They even had Sir Terry\nWogan appear in a video intro, thus\ngiving kudos in the eyes of the Eurovision fans.\nAnd so to the show itself; the general\npremise of the Eurovision Song Contest (in case you didn\u2019t know) is that\neach country presents a song and then\nall the other countries vote for their fa-vourite, or their neighbour, or anyone\nbut the UK. The Eurovision Song Contest is well known for its cheesy dance\nroutines, dodgy lyrics and removal of\nclothes part way through routines. Eurobeat has this and much more. Also\nlike the Eurovision Song Contest, Eurobeat had some songs that I found really dull, such as Iceland\u2019s take on Bjork\nand Germany\u2019s attempt at a Kraftwerk\ncum performance art type piece which\nDale found uproarious but I didn\u2019t get\nat all.\nThen there were some songs that\nwere absolute genius, my favourite\nbeing Poland - the eventual winner of\nthe evening. Poland\u2019s entry was \u201cTogether Again\u201d performed by Toomas\nJerker and the Hard Pole Dancers\n(great name, I know) and is probably\nthe campest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. This\nproduction number included everything you could ever want: men dancing with briefcases then stripping off\ntheir business suits to reveal spandex\nunitards, a cute lead singer and a dancing routine that involved fisting (Dale\nalmost had a fit at this point).\nWe both decided we were in love\nwith Toomas Jerker and would be voting for the Poles, having the chance to\ndo so just before the interval. The Euto cast your vote. I, of course, managed to cock this up by trying to vote\nfor Sweden and genuinely felt a bit of a\ntwat given that this was make believe.\nWe returned after the interval to\nfind out the results and to see the half\ntime entertainment, which was a sidesplitting tale about the joys of Sarajevo\nsung by Boyka dressed as a turnip. By\nthe time we reached the live results I\nwas actually really excited. The results\nwere given via a large video screen\nwith the ensemble members as the\ndifferent correspondents, from the\nincomprehensible Irish reporter to\nthe Russian reporter being forced to\nchange the results by the KGB. There\nwere also regular visits to the \u2018Green\nRoom\u2019 featuring whoever wasn\u2019t in the\nprocess of changing costume to give\nthe results (as each ensemble member\nplays many different parts). As previously mentioned, Poland won causing\nme to whoop so loud I still haven\u2019t got\nmy voice back, but also meaning we\ngot to see their amazing performance\nagain. This time the lead decided to\nremove his shirt halfway through and\nrun around the auditorium topless.\nSigh. The things I have to see for you,\ndear reader. We left the theatre on a\nhigh and spent the entire walk to the\ntube humming along.\nThe show itself had very few negative\npoints but was let down by some technical aspects. Throughout the first half\nsound was a major issue with the show\nbeing stopped for 10 minutes to fix mi-crophones. Even after that it was still\ndifficult to hear what should have been\nsome very funny lyrics over the backing tracks. These are issues that should\nhave been sorted out during previews\nand so I was disappointed to see that\nsafety curtain lower half an hour in.\nThe cast did cover this up well, making it feel part of the show with a very\nfunny comment about Lehman brothers providing the electricity funding.\nI also found that a bright, raucous\nproduction didn\u2019t sit well in ornate\nNovello theatre and the atmosphere\njust felt strange. We were encouraged\nto talk after the productions, discuss\nour views, interact and generally make\nlots of noise; something that disagrees\nwith my theatre-going etiquette. I was\nfine once I got over the fact that I was\nallowed to whoop and laugh until I\nwas hoarse. The audience was also a\nstrange mix of both traditional theatre\ngoers and what my friend referred to as\n\u201chomos and hen nights\u201d.\nThis is one of Eurobeats\u2019 charms;\nmanaging to captivate everyone with\na genuinely intelligent, topical humour\nbrought out spectacularly by our hosts\nDennis and Giedroyc, who came out\nwith the classic \u201cloosen your genital cuffs\u201d. The humour also works on\nmany levels from the subtle to the sen-sational, from slapstick to political humour and word play (much of this focused on bad pronunciation of English\n- arms/arse etc.). The ensemble did a\nfantastic job of making us believe these\nridiculous characters could actually be\nreal, but without taking the show too\nseriously. The songs are catchy and\nwell written, each sounding individual\nyet all somehow encapsulating that feel\nof Eurovision.\nEurobeat manages to combine clever\ndialogue with completely over the top\nproduction values to give something\nthat will appeal to everyone from \u201chomos to hen nights\u201d to drunken Freshers\u2019 nights out and even your Mum and\nDad. Eurobeat is Eurovision at its good\nold-fashioned best and is one of the\nbest nights out I\u2019ve had in a long time.\nIn fact, I think Eurobeat might actually\nbe better than Eurovision itself.\nEurobeat ends on 15th November\nat the Novello Theatre. Go see itit\u2019s glamorous, glitzy and gay!\nHmm, we love the smell of sequinned spandex in the morning. Yes, they keep their socks on throughout\nYou might have guessed that a Eurovision musical was going to be a little bit camp and these sexy, young\nPolish chaps provide conclusive evidence of that fact.\nPicture\nof\nthe\nWeek\nPutney\nBridge\nat\nDawn,\nby\nJonathan\nSilver\nFirst\nYear\nMaterials\nWe\nwant\nto\nexhibit\nyour\nart.\nSend\nin\nyour\nphotographs.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I\u2019m sorry everyone. It\u2019s\nnot the best way to start the\nyear, but I did it. On Sunday\nmorning at 11:32am I betrayed\nmy footballing love and embarked on a lustful affair with FIFA 09,\nfuelled by attractive aesthetics, a desire\nto conquer uncharted and mystical ter-ritory, new buttons to push, and a fully\nfleshed out package (matron!).\nAfter ten years of inseparable mat-rimony, 2008 was the lowest of low\npoints in my previous relationship, and\nthe time came for Thomas Anthony\nRoberts and the Pro Evo series to go\nour separate ways.\nSure, it\u2019s not the be all and end all.\nWe\u2019re still on good terms and if we meet\nat a party or something, we\u2019ll definitely\nconverse, appreciate the good ol\u2019 times\nand glance in each other\u2019s general direc-tion. We might even have a quick fum-ble. I certainly haven\u2019t ruled that possibility out although I\u2019m not sure my new\nmissus would be best pleased.\nMy relationship with Pro Evo became stale. Heck, I barely touched\nher during the 2007-08 season, I was\nthat tired of the old dear. Ever since\nthe glorious days of Pro Evo 5, things\nhave never quite been the same again.\nThe relationship slowed down, became\nless exciting. The little things began to\nniggle at me more. The things that I\nbrushed off before because my undying love was all conquering. But part\nway through 2008 I began to have eyes\nfor fairer beauties. It\u2019s an old clich\u00e9 but\nthe grass started to become greener on\nother football pitches. We even tried\nto reconcile our differences last week\nwhen she unveiled her latest build to\nme, playable on Xbox Live. Initially I\nwas aghast, the flame began to reignite\nand I felt that giddy excitement in the\npit of my tummy, but who was I fool-ing? Myself. It was time to put the past\nbehind me and move on.\nAnd here I am. FIFA 09 has moved\nin with me and flowers are already\nbeginning to bloom. The memories\nof Pez (that was my pet name for her,\nheh! Sniff.) still remain, and sometimes\nI feel like I treat Fifi (what?) too much\nlike my old flame, which I\u2019m not sure\nshe\u2019s keen on. But we\u2019re getting along\njust fine. She really is a looker, but\nwhat she lacks in charm and intelligence she really makes up for in other\nareas. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen such a\nfully-fleshed out slice of fun! There are\nso many things to discover, so many\nsecrets to unlock and I can definitely\nsee this relationship lasting for at least\na year or more. But then there\u2019s the\nparents. Mr Konami was a fairly mod-est, sedate fellow who rarely interfered\nwith his baby\u2019s development, but I\nhear Mr EA is a hulking juggernaut of\na beast. Quite meddling in fact, and if\nhe gets his claws in there could be consequences that ripple through our new\nrelationship.\nAnyway, you\u2019re probably all shout-ing, \u201cGet a blog emo kid,\u201d but I\u2019ll leave\nyou with this: if anyone wants a three-some, I\u2019m well up for it.\nIf you want to write something\nsensible on these pages, email\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nBargain Hunt: The Game\nStruggling with budgetary requirements? Tom Roberts has his priorities in order and\noffers a few tips on how to fuel your gaming habit without spending a small fortune\nL\niving in London, as you\u2019re\nprobably already aware, is\nan expensive and challenging undertaking. With so\nmuch to do and see, budgeting becomes a balancing act: do I\nskip breakfast and lunch every day\nthis week, whilst running the risk of\ncatching the bad AIDs and incurring\nthe wrath of my ever-watchful mother,\njust so that I can afford to venture to\nElephant & Castle on a Friday night\nin search of strobe lights and grade-B\nstockhookersattheMinistryofSound?\nThen, to top off your hedonistic addictions you\u2019re probably a big fan of video\ngames. With such a meagre loan, how\nare you going to afford to live and rescue Peach from the clutches of Bowser\nat the same?\nHopefully, the following guide will\ngive you some ideas about where you\ncan pick up games more cheaply. Initially, the article was aimed right between the eyes of our fresher university companions but having spoken to a\nnumber of my friends, many of whom\nstill rely on GAME to supplement their\ncyber addiction, gaming poverty is\nmore widespread than I had originally\nthought. On the other hand, if you\u2019re\nthe gaming equivalent of David Dickinson and you\u2019ve uncovered some places\nthat sell games even cheaper than chips\nthat I haven\u2019t stumbled upon, do get in\ntouch and we can spread the love in a\nfuture issue.\nOn the Highstreet\nBuying games on the high street really\nis a good way of burning money fast. At\n40 quid a pop for most console games,\nyou\u2019ll be drinking tap water and eating\nchopped tomatoes out of a can for the\nfollowing two weeks. Not even the Napolina variety. If you must have a game\non release day, then you\u2019re going to be\npaying a premium whether you go online or not. If you do choose to head to\nthe high street, shop around. On High\nStreet Ken for instance, many a time\nZavvi has bettered GAME. Blockbusters, a bit further down the street, has\na penchant for pricing new releases at\n\u00a329.99. In fact, your best bets are the\nsupermarkets: only this week I managed to get FIFA 09 for just under 30\nnotes. And yes, I am ashamed I bought\na FIFA game, see elsewhere on the page\nfor a flimsy attempt at justification. Supermarkets only tend to stock the most\nmainstream titles though, so buying\nDisgaea 3 on release day for less than\ntop dollar will be nigh on impossible.\nSo far GAME (replace with Gamestation if you like) has hasn\u2019t fared too\nwell in this article, but their pre-owned\nsections aren\u2019t that dreadful, where you\ncan often pick up older releases on 2\nfor \u00a320 offers. Likewise, with dramatic\nprice cuts on all titles \u2013 whether pre-owned or not \u2013 after 3-6 months in\nmost stores, it\u2019s certainly worth waiting before buying. I managed to pick\nup Company of Heroes and Lost on\nthe PC together for \u00a315 from GAME\nnot so long ago.\nInternet Retailers and Search\nEngines\nNow that I\u2019ve figuratively shat on the\nhigh street, we can move on to the in-ternet: serious business. Many internet retailers root themselves into the\nfertile soils of the Channel Islands so\nthat they can dodge various tax costs;\nplay.com, hmv.com and Tesco Jersey\nare just a few. Thankfully, they actually lop a bit off the RRP rather than\nbunging the extra wedge into their teak\ncoffers. New PC releases often start at\n\u00a317.99 and console games come in at\n\u00a329.99, or \u00a334.99 for the heavy sellers.\nThat\u2019s a hell of a saving on PC games\nespecially. In the wake of play.com\u2019s\nsuccess, a plethora of websites have\nsprung up, all trying to out-price each\nother. Competition is excellent news\nfor the consumer, but trawling every\nsite is a tedious process. Find-games.\nco.uk cuts out this faff. Simply enter\nthe name of the title you\u2019re after and\nit will give you a link to the best price\non the interweb. Simple. A sister sites\nalso exists for DVDs (find-dvd.co.uk).\nYou could use kelkoo or whatever, but\nfrankly most other comparison sites\nare unwieldy and don\u2019t cater specifically to a gamer\u2019s needs. Find-games.\nco.uk is especially useful when it comes\nto older titles since you\u2019ll often discover prices slashed far more on one site\ncompared to the others as they attempt\nto shift some older stock.\nObviously, the main disadvantage of\ninternet retailers is the postage delay.\nTimes vary for different websites, and\ndifferent people will tell you different\nstories about their individual experi-ences. In my view, use the cheapest site\nwhen it\u2019s not urgent. Gameplay.com\nis one of the best sites for pre-orders,\noften breaking release date. Shush, just\ndon\u2019t tell the publishers!\nFinally, spare a thought for websites\nbelonging to electronics stores such as\nComet and Currys. Often they have ridiculous price cuts on games, down to\nas little as a fiver for 360 and PS3 titles\nthat they want shot of quickly. They\nshould also appear on find-games.\nco.uk.\nSecond Hand Games\neBay is an obvious source of cheap\ngames, but one that requires careful\nmonitoring. Always make sure you\ncheck out the seller\u2019s feedback and if\nhe\u2019s labelled his item: \u201cL@@K AWEZOMES GAME FOR JU \u2013 NEED FOR\nSPEED EA PWNAGE TRIPLE SIXTY\nVERSHUN!!1one!11\u201d you probably\nwant to avoid it. Prices often baffle me\nhere too; people frequently bid higher\nthan if they used find-games.co.uk and\nsometimes even above the RRP, which\nprobably says a lot about the IQ of the\naverage eBay user. My mum included.\nWhilst you\u2019ll struggle to find the\nmore obscure titles on Amazon\u2019s Marketplace, compared with eBay it\u2019s a\ndecent alternative for finding cheap,\nsecond hand games. The main bonus\nis that there\u2019s no need to deal with irritating people, vastly inflated postage\ncosts and the shifty atmosphere that\neBay has procured with its popularity.\nThere\u2019s also a safe buying guarantee up\nto \u00a32,000 should your item not meet\nthe advertised specification or fail to\nbe delivered.\nGaming Forums\nNow we\u2019re descending into the real\nsticky-taped spectacles depths of internet bargaining. Sir Dickinson would\nbe proud. The internet is frequented\nby millions of people everyday and\nguess what, they\u2019re not actually all pae-dophiles. I know, I know, I\u2019ve revealed\none of the internet\u2019s biggest secrets\nthere; one that could potentially put\nthe editors of The Sun and The Daily\nMail out of business, but it\u2019s the truth.\nGaming forums are a hive of like minded individuals, many of whom buy and\nplay far too many games, many more\nthan they can possibly consume let\nalone afford. If you join your favourite\nsite\u2019s forum, you\u2019ll likely find a bargains\nthread peppered with links to websites\nselling games at very low prices. Using\nthese forums is a great way of getting\ngames cheaply, the only real danger is\nthat you\u2019ll still spend 40 quid, although\non three games instead of one. Hell,\nyou don\u2019t even have to talk to people\non the forums. Just sign up and lurk in\nthe background, reaping the benefits\nthat your fellow gamers sow.\nBetter still, if you\u2019re feeling brave join\na forum that has a Swapsies thread:\none where gamers list what they\u2019ve got\non offer and what they\u2019re after. For the\ncost of postage, this is easily the most\neffective and cheapest way of getting\nthrough many, many games. Bearing in\nmind that no-one is going to swap Little Big Planet for Quake 64, you\u2019re best\nbet is to complete a new game as soon\nas possible and then venture to such\nthreads whilst your cupcake is still\nhot. With much smaller communities\nthan say eBay and written interaction\nbetween forum-goers, you\u2019ll soon get\na feel for the more trustworthy individuals and filter out the shady dealers.\nGaming forums are a treasure trove: I\nmanaged to pick up an Xbox 360, with\na wireless bridge, four games and some\nother bobbins, for about \u00a3100-150\ncheaper than if I\u2019d bought it online.\nAnd finally\u2026\nIt would be criminal of me to write this\nguide without mentioning hotdealsuk.\ncom. Founded in 2004, the idea behind\nthe site was to filter through all the advertising waffle that is thrust through\nour retinas everyday and spread the\nword on the best bargains in all walks\nof life. A quick glance at the site shows\nme that I can get Iris with Judi Dench\nwhat-off-the-telly for \u00a31.99, Smash\nCourt Tennis 3 for a tenner and a huge\nbox of Coco Pops for \u00a32 from ASDA.\nYou can filter the site for whatever\nyou\u2019re interested in and when a new\nbargain is spotted users affect its ranking by voting depending on how \u2018hot\u2019\nthey deem the deal to be. Most forums\nlink to hotdealsuk.com regularly so\nit\u2019s probably not necessary to watch it\nconstantly, but it\u2019s worth keeping an\neye on.\nA more recent phenomenon is quid-co.com. In a nutshell, the website acts\nas a cashback scheme. After creating a\nquidco account, you simply log in, click\non an affiliate link from within quidco.\ncom which takes you to your favourite\nwebsite, eg: play.com, and then shop\nas normal. Quidco alters your web\nbrowser\u2019s cookies so that when you\npurchase something from play.com\nthey know you found the website by\ngoing via Quidco. You\u2019re then given a\npercentage of your purchase back in\ncashback form; anything from a few to\nten percent or so.\nEventually you are \u2018paid\u2019 by Quidco,\nwho will transfer what you have accrued into your bank account. I haven\u2019t\nactually set up an account myself, but\nsome people I have spoken to have\nmade hundreds and hundreds pounds\nfrom Quidco, especially since it can be\nused on just about any major website,\nincluding non-gaming ones.\nSo, there you go. As a rule of thumb\nshop around, especially on the high\nstreet. Unwrap yourself from any cotton wool you might be cocooned in\nand do investigate the \u2018darker\u2019 depths\nof the internet. And don\u2019t just go for\nthe latest releases, there\u2019s a plethora of\nolder gaming goodness out there for\nmuch cheapness.\nThese tips are by no means exhaustive though: I\u2019ve omitted the bargains\navailable on Steam, rental websites, in-die-devs and flash based sites, the latter of which have surprisingly sophisticated games, all for free. Hopefully\nthough, this guide will give you food\nfor thought and food for your belly!\nFour web addresses any thrifty geek should have bookmarked\nwww.find-games.co.uk\nwww.avforums.com/forums/gaming-bargains/ www.eurogamer.net/forum_thread_posts.php?thread_id=2204\nwww.hotdealsuk.com\nTotal US\nrevenues for 2007\nGames: $18.8bn Movies: $9.5bn\nFleecing you and taking your money to the bank \u2013 laughing \u2013 since stores opened!\nYou\u2019ll struggle to find the new releases much below the RRP anywhere. Supermarkets might knock off a tenner though. I\u2019m so sorry Pez, dear\n\n"

At least I\ncan say I gave you that much. I\nsaid to myself, \u201cBig Gee,\u201d I said\n\u2013 that\u2019s what I call myself when\nI\u2019m chillin\u2019 \u2013 \u201cBig Gee, give those\nfools some time. They\u2019ll come around.\u201d\nBut no. I wasn\u2019t clear enough, it seems.\nSo let\u2019s put it in the felix archives so\nI can tell the Metropolitan Police, \u201cI\nwarned them,\u201d \u2013 please stop telling\nme what you did over summer. I can\u2019t\nremember the last time anyone cared\nabout anything you did, but I\u2019m pretty\nsure our current monarch wasn\u2019t on\nour currency. And we didn\u2019t have cur-rency. Or a monarch.\nThe simple truth is that not a lot of\npeople are interested in how you spent\nthree months of your already overlong\nstay on this planet, and yes, I am of\ncourse talking about internships. Almost all first-years will be oblivious to\nthese time-eating bastards, so here\u2019s a\nbrief overview \u2013 internships come in\ntwo flavours; wastes of time, and overpaid wastes of time. How it works is\nthis \u2013 you spend most of the first term\ncompletely oblivious to the idea of\nshitting your summer down a gold-en-crusted toilet, until That Friend turns\nA. Geek\nup on your email in January. You know\nThat Friend - the person who phoned\nyou up at the end of Freshers\u2019 Week\nconcerned they weren\u2019t preparing early\nenough for end-of-year exams. They\u2019ll\nask you if you have an internship yet.\nYou\u2019ll answer no, of course, but this\u2019ll\nget you thinking, and thanks to The Incredible Worry asking the same thing\nto everyone you know, it\u2019ll soon whip\nup a frenzy of queries and secretive applications and interviews, which everyone will always say \u2018went well\u2019 even\nif they performed worse than a quadri-plegic-fronted tour of Riverdance. Not\nthat there\u2019s any secrecy about who\u2019s\nbeen successful, because when you get\na confirmed place, you\u2019ll tell everyone.\nBelieve me. It\u2019s like one of those after-school TV gameshows for kids, all it\nneeds is an \u201cAcceptance Gong\u201d in the\nJCR for the freaks to smack with their\nforeheads when their letter comes\nthrough.\nWhen that dies down, you\u2019ll completely forget about the whole thing\nuntil the exams are over and you feel\nlike sleeping all through the holiday.\nExcept you can\u2019t. Bright and early starts\nfor you and your revision-addled body\nbecause four days later your placement\nbegins!\nTen weeks pass. You experience a\nmix of emotions, such as the desire to\nclaw your own eyes out with a canteen\nspork, the wishes of death upon holier-than-thou colleagues who probably\nhave a 2:2 from Sunderland University,\nand momentary elation at pasta carbonara day in the canteen. But mainly\nthe sporks and death thing.\nWhen you stumble back \u2013 having\nhad roughly two weeks in total not\nworking \u2013 you\u2019re obviously going to\nfeel like you\u2019ve wasted a considerable\nchunk of your life. That\u2019s fair enough.\nSo what you do is you dress it up for\neveryone else. If the team knew fuck-tonnes more than you because you\u2019re a\nmoronic excuse for a student, then say\nthey were \u2018too old\u2019 or \u2018old-fashioned\u2019.\nIf you were utterly incapable of following orders, say the work \u2018was fine,\nbut the team were hard to work with\u2019.\nIf you simply did sod all for ten weeks,\nwell, you can say you \u2018learnt a lot\u2019 at\nthe very least. Not that that would be\nan impressive feat. Staring blankly into\na small dish of yeast would probably\nbe a horizon-widening experience for\nsomeone like you.\nSure, I did internships back in the\nday. Placements at Imperial, in fact\n\u2013 low-paid, and occasionally quite in-teresting. But let\u2019s be quite clear, there\nare three reasons people do internships \u2013 money, your CV and money.\nMoney, because if you\u2019re planning to\nfricass\u00e9e your sanity on the barbecue\nof bad decisions, then why not start\nearly; your CV, because if you need a\nplacement year then \u2018laid some sweet\nass in Tenerife\u2019 is not going to go down\nas a productive use of a Summer in any\ninterview process; and money because,\nwell, it seems to deserve a second mention because you get given so fucking\nmuch of it.\nLess of the pretence that you did\nsomething worthwhile, please. You\nwere taken on, patronised and buttered up in the hope that you\u2019ll come\nback in a few years to be trained prop-erly. I don\u2019t care what your manager\nsaid, where you bought the new watch\nfrom, or how many people said you\u2019re\n\u201csuch a nice guy\u201d. You\u2019re back at Imperial, the JCR soup still tastes like Vomit\n\u2018N Parsley, and there\u2019s coursework due\nsoon. Welcome back to the real world.\nJelly Bean\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\nI\nf you haven\u2019t noticed yet, it\u2019s\nnow a new academic year. You\ncan tell this by observing a few\nsimple indicators: some of your\npencils may not have yet been\nchewed (or alternatively they are all\nalready pre-chewed from last years ex-ams), there is a strange and unnatural\nsense of optimism in the air and your\nbody has gone into shock at the dramatic plummeting of food quality over\nthe last month. (Shortly the concept\nof \u2018dessert\u2019 will all but fade from your\nunder-nourished mind and become\nmixed up with vague recollections of\nNordic legend you have from primary\nschool. It won\u2019t be long before financial restraints mean that 70% of the\nmeals you eat consist entirely of tinned\ntomato. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve got\nquite a number of pints to get through\nbefore you realise suddenly that your\nloan is somewhat smaller than you\nfirst thought and it\u2019s only week three.)\nOf course there are plenty of other\nhorribly over-mentioned signs of new\nbeginnings which I\u2019m sure will already\nbe annoying you. The classic freshers\u2019\nweek questions you are being asked\nby everyone, the number of clubs you\nsigned up to etc. (end of thinking ca-pacity). There is another clue that it\u2019s a\nnew year though, which I\u2019d like to just\ndwell on a little with the sort of morbid\nfascination of a child poking the eye of\na washed up fish with a pointy stick. It\u2019s\nslimy and painful and sure ain\u2019t pret-ty, but like every obstacle on the bear\nhunt, there\u2019s no way around it, there\u2019s\nno way over it, there\u2019s no way under it.\nYou\u2019re going to have to go through it\n(90% of you in fact, according to wiki).\nStudents are, like mosquitoes, a vector of disease; carefully collecting viruses from across the UK, and in the\ncase of Imperial, the globe, and, bringing them to central melting pots called\n\u2018universities\u2019 they inadvertently create\na new and terrifying ailment known\ncommonly as \u2018Freshers\u2019 Flu\u2019 every single year. It and landmines I would say\nare the two most pertinent answers to\nthat most vexing of riddles \u2018Why do\nbirds suddenly disappear?\u2019 The symptoms are numerous, but invariably\ndebilitating, sometimes requiring am-putation. The coughing and sniffing in\nlectures will wind you up no end, even\nwhilst you yourself know and surrender to those primitive urges to voice\nyour grating and dribbley misery with\nthe chorus that punctuates every single\nsentence of fluid mechanics, or gastro-enterology, or multivariable calculus\nor whatever your particular vein of\nself-inflicted cancer is. It strikes with\ndeadly force right at the beginning of\nevery year; at the one time when you\nstill believe the coming year might be\nbetter than the last and when a large\nproportion of the population are still\nbright-eyed and fending off a little\nhome-sickness; the metaphorical gonads of student life.\nYou\u2019ll be told that it\u2019s to do with pass-rates, but the real reason the number\nof people on your course drops so\nmuch every year is \u2018timor pestilentae\nnoviciorum\u2019, the Latin name for the\ninnate fear of freshers\u2019 flu that I just\nmade up. (With a little help from the\ninternet and a very confused Latin\nteacher at a party.) In case you are interested I thought that the use of the\nroot \u2018novicius\u2019 meaning [new, fresh;\nesp. of persons new to slavery] at the\nend there was particularly appropriate\nto those who had just began a degree.\nTrouble is though, if you were interested then you probably know something\nabout Latin and may still be fuming at\nmy ignorance; JellyBean with Latin is\nlike a 4 year old with ADHD trying to\nmend a Swiss watch using a nine-iron.\nStill, you can\u2019t fault my enthusiasm to\nattempt something I am entirely unqualified to handle.\nAnyway, I am not one to moan and\ngripe. It\u2019s not my job to proclaim\nClarkson-esque opinions on everything but the column title, but simply\nto bring you my thoughts and ideas on\nthings from a view point so far out of\nthe box that it is beyond the bounds of\nsanity and running nude, arms waving\nfrantically for the horizon. In the past\nI brought you, amongst other things, a\nbrief history of canoe juggling, hooty\ncream, numerous innovative methods\nfor electricity generation (one of which\ninvolved lemmings) and inspirational\nthoughts from the life an onion and I\nintend to continue presenting you with\nthought-provoking nonsensicalities,\namusing stories and obscure similes\nfor another year.\nTimor pestilentae noviciorum\nCaz Knight\nO\nn August 9 2008, The\nGuardian reported that\nAmerican publishing\ngiant Random House\ndropped plans to publish \u2018The Jewel of Medina\u2019 by journalist\nSylvia Jones, for fear of inciting violence from terrorist groups. The novel\nis a fictional account of the prophet\nMuhammad\u2019s relationship with his\nchild bride, Aisha, and was accused of\nmaking fun of Muslims and their history by Denise Spellberg, professor\nof Middle Eastern studies at the University of Texas. The decision called\ninto question the state of free speech\nin the U.S.A. Six weeks later the safety\nof Martin Rynja, owner of small, independent publishing house Gibson\nSquare (which also published \u2018Blowing up Russia\u2019 by the late Alexander\nLitvinenko), came into question when\nhis house was firebombed following\nhis decision to publish the novel. Rynja\nwas unharmed and sticks firmly to his\n\u201cimperative\u201d decision to publish Jones\u2019\nbook.\nThe critics of the novel need to remember that this book is fictitious and\nnot an attempt to accurately portray\nhistory; Spellberg took issue with the\nbook on the grounds that it \u201cplay[ed]\nwith sacred history and turn[ed] it into\nsoftcorepornography\u201d.ObviouslySpellberg is not getting enough. Not only is\nthe book devoid of sex scenes (instead\nchartering the couple\u2019s love story), but\nalso seeks to honour the prophet and\nis anything but disrespectful. This aim,\naccording to Jones, is even more potent\nwhen written by a white, non-Muslim\nwoman. One has to wonder whether\nthese fire-bombers had even read this\nhitherto unpublished novel or whether\nthey were ignorantly going by hearsay\nin the media.\nThe politics aside, even if the novel\ncontained some risqu\u00e9 scenes that\ncouldpossiblyoffendpeople,oneneeds\nto remember that this is fiction! I do\nnot think that any social, sexual, political or religious niche has ever emerged\nunscathed from the realms of fiction. If\nyou are likely to be offended by something it is best to close your eyes and\nears and develop a thicker skin. I can\nappreciate that if the \u2018Jewel of Medina\u2019\nwas, indeed, blasphemous against Islam then this could cause offense to\ncertain parties. This would still not be\na just cause for halting publication.\nPhillip Pullman, author of the beloved Northern Lights trilogy, reinforces\nthis point by claiming that religion is\nthe WORST reason to ban something.\nHe says that religion is a wonderful\nthing that can be the source of moral\nwisdom and solace but turns sour once\nits leaders start meddling in the \u201csocial\nand intellectual lives of their flock\u201d.\nThe bid to destroy intellectual freedom\nis inarguably evil; evil being a notion\nwhich religion usually seeks to quash.\nDo the censors not realise that by\nbanning something that it not only\nmakes us more aware of the illicit text/\nfilm/image but it makes us yearn for it\nmore? Oscar Wilde makes this point\nthrough the character Lord Henry\nWorron in \u2018A Picture of Dorian Gray\u2019,\n\u201cwhen the soul gets sick the way to\ncure it is to deny the senses nothing,\u201d\nimplying that to deny ourselves is to\nmake our souls desire that thing more.\nNothing can be truer and anyone reading this will, I am sure, agree.\nA few days before Random House\nchickened out, exam board AQA\n\u201cask[ed] schools to destroy book containing knife poem\u201d. It is clear from\ntheir choice of words that The Guardian shares my opinion on the matter!\nCarol Ann Duffy\u2019s \u2018Education for Leisure\u2019 begins with the line, \u201cToday I am\ngoing to kill something. Anything\u201d.\nThis sparked concerns that G.C.S.E\nchildren studying the poem would get\nthe wrong idea, given the increase in\nknife crime. On hearing this, my anger\nsurged; that the education authorities\ncould be so damn patronising! Can 16\nyear-old young adults not be trusted to\nhandle controversial and very relevant\nissues? The poem might go a long way\nto reinforcing just how fucked up it is\nto carry a knife. By re-hashing the issue over and over through study of the\npoem, might the allure of knife crime\nnot be dampened a little? Removing a\npoem about knives from schools only\nserves to glamourise such conduct\neven more. Taboo issues will be a catalyst for debates and intellectual discussions \u2013 the point of and a means to\nlearning. These children need teach-ers; not nannies who obviously think\nthat their pupils are capable of nothing\nelse but monkey see monkey do. Carol\nAnn Duffy made an excellent point in\nher responsive poem \u2018Mrs. Schofield\u2019s\nGCSE\u2019 by reminding us that literature is\nlittered with knife crime (hello, Romeo\nand Juliet, Macbeth\u2026). Pat Schofield,\nwho made the initial complaint about\n\u2018Education for Leisure\u2019 thought that\nthe poem dedicated to her was \u201ca bit\nweird\u201d. It is a wonder these critics do\nnot think of better ways of articulating their indignation to appear slightly\nmore intelligent so as to carry their argument further.\nIt is heartening though to see figures such as Rynja and poet laureate\nMichael Rosen rise to the defence of\nthose who are simply exercising their\nright to free speech. I think, also, that\nin this climate of ever more stifling political correctness we all need to lighten up and not be so afraid of offending\nsomebody somewhere.\nLi-Teck Lau\nI\nhad to physically push past\nFreshers just to get through\nSherfield the other day, the\nstench of naivet\u00e9 steaming off\neach and every one of them like a\nheat haze on an third world airfield. Of\ncourse there are no third world countries anymore in the strictest sense of\nthe term seeing as the Cold War is so\nover, but I choose to use it if only to\naggravate those among us who oft sit\nin Starbucks drinking the fair-trade\ncoffee option and who readily admit to\nbeing a \u2018liberal\u2019. How is it that warmongering has become such a social faux\npas? I blame the Clintons.\nAlas, the political world is now embroiled in the problems of the econo-my. Everybody and nobody is to blame\nin (n)either Whitehall (n)or Washington; it\u2019s all those greedy bankers\u2019 faults\nevidently. If you came to this university\nwith the hope of afterwards joining an\ninvestment bank using the transferable\nskills you learnt during fluids lectures\nas your metaphorical ace of spades,\nthen I salute you; there\u2019s nothing like\nseeing cash on the table and trampling\nbabies just to get to it. And I mean that,\ntruthfully. As long as it\u2019s not your baby,\nthen the rules of gene theory readily\nsupport you. Society has been lax, in a\npseudo-euphemistic sense of the word,\nto regulate the industry, probably due\nto a combination of incoherence, incompetence and collusion, and is now\nin a phase of change. But looking on\nthe bright side, isn\u2019t it wonderful to be\nwitnessing the maturing of civilisation?\nIt\u2019s like the life story of Dave (a wholly\narbitrary choice of name; Lola if you\u2019re\na militant feminist) as he learns to ride\na bike; there are wobbles, falls, the occasional accident involving a car. Let\u2019s\njust hope this time it isn\u2019t a kidnapping\nor something. In the end, however,\nhe will be free to explore the limitless\nbounds of the universe.\nIf money was never really your thing\n(and you\u2019re very much a hardcore politics junkie), then one comforting development of recent is the return of Peter\nMandelson, the hero of New Labour in\nthe 1990\u2019s, back from exile in Europe\nto sit in Mr Brown\u2019s cabinet. The Tories are on a slight backfoot after a mini\nLabour bounce following the deepening financial turmoil/the realisation by\nmany that Mr Cameron is little more\nthan a glorified speaking bandwagon,\nand the Prime Minister\u2019s speech to the\nLabour Party conference last month,\nbut remain comfortably ahead in opinion polls. Felix Politics will follow with\nkeen enthusiasm to see whether this\none-time \u2018king of spin\u2019 can turn the\nruling party\u2019s fortunes around.\nDid I mention that I\u2019ve always been\na fan of subsistence farming? If there\u2019s\na single lesson to be learnt from reading this column of second hand infor-mation, it\u2019s that the world is a danger-ous, mischievous place, where bankers\ncheat you and politicians molest your\nopinions. Welcome to Imperial, if\nyou\u2019ve just joined us!\nGene theory and investment banking\nFreedom of speech\nI\ndon\u2019t know if this is a phenomenon exclusive to timepiece-mad\nSwitzerland where I have spent\nmost of the past fifteen years of\nmy life, but there is one particu-larlyobnoxiouspublicitycampaignthat\nhas assaulted my senses from every direction for as long as I can remember.\nA well-known watch manufacturer has\ntaken it upon itself to broadcast what\nmust be one of the more nauseating\nadvertising ideas I have seen in recent\nyears.\nAnyone who has ever walked down\nthe aisles of a Swiss airport will know\nthe advert I mean. It is the picture of\na Man with revoltingly sleek hair, an\nimpossibly well-fitting suit and, quite\nclearly, a capital M. He is accompanied\nby a younger version of himself of more\nthan usually revolting narcissism, and\nthe imposing words: \u2018You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely\nlook after it for the next generation.\u2019\nThe one redeeming feature of these\nposters is that they allow you to construct your own back-story for the\ncharacters. By now, I take comfort in\nimagining, the father will have lost\nhis two million pound a year job with\nthe brothers Lehman and the son\u2019s father issues are so developed that even\nhis psychotherapist may not be sure\nwhether the Electra complex applies to\nhim or not. Hey, that\u2019s two psychology\nreferences in as many weeks \u2013 there\nmust be some sort of prize for that.\nMaybe a buy-one-get-one-free deal on\npersonalities?\nBut I\u2019m getting distracted. The truth\nis that I don\u2019t want to spend too much\ntime on the overblown pretension of\nthe figures in the images, the inane\ngrandeur of the slogan or the diseased\nmind-set required to actually purchase a Patek Philippe. Such reverse\nsnobbery is likely to come amiss from\nsomeone typing with a wrist weighted\ndown by a Tissot. There. I\u2019ve taken it\noff and the gloves could potentially\ncome off with it.\nBut I have bigger fish to fry. As ridiculous as the Patek Philippe motto is\nwhen applied to a piece of metal you\nattach to your hand to avoid having\nto look up at the sun to know when to\ncheck your e-mails, it\u2019s a pretty good\nsentence.\nAnd it\u2019s ideal when it comes to describing London. London is not a city\nanyone lives in. It\u2019s a city that temporarily permits your existence until the\ntime has come to move on. Not even\nthe current resident of 10 Downing\nStreet (I hesitate to give him a specific\nname: this article is supposed to be\nrelevant until next Friday. Who knows\nwhat will have happened by then?) can\ntruly claim to live in the city.\nWhereasManhattanintimidateswith\nthe ruthless grandeur of its architecture and the sheer petrifying breadth\nof its pavements (or do I mean side-walks?), London needs no such physical displays of domination. The imposing nature of London comes from the\nruthless grandeur of its great figures\nand the sheer petrifying breadth of its\nhistory.\nIf cities were high-class escort girls,\nParis would get you a good time; gleefully faking her satisfaction loudly and\noften. Manhattan would probably have\na book open behind your arhythmi-cally thrusting back, totally and hu-miliatingly indifferent to you and your\ninadequate performance. Asking me to\nname the book might be to get carried\naway by the flow of the metaphor, but I\nwould hazard a guess at \u2018The Wealth of\nNations\u2019 or, perhaps, the TV Guide.\nLondon, however, is where my\nmetaphor really breaks down. Try as\nI might, I cannot picture London as\na buxom bimbo with amusing sexual\ncharacteristics; I cannot visualize any\nact of closeness a person can have with\nthis city. It is impossible to be on intimate terms with a city that has survived wars, revolutions, epidemics,\nfires, bombings and 5 months of Boris\nJohnson. Let Manhattan and other cities aggressively take you for a ride, brutally exhaust you and leave you spent\nand broken on the sidewalk (or do I\nmean pavement?). London may treat\nyou more gently, but with an impassive\ndignity born of knowing your complete\nunimportance.\nLondon is not a place you can mould\nto your own image. It is a city that inexorably moulds you. The city as it\nstands today is the product of countless generations, and your own insignificance weighs you down wherever\nyou go. In smaller cities and towns you\nhave the impression that you can make\na difference. As though you can leave\na mark that will last forever. Not here.\nA city where you can daily walk past\nthe seat of kings, look up at the 51.6\nmeter phallus on which a one-eyed\nadmiral who helped save an empire is\nperched, stare at the mother of all parliaments on your way to get something\nto eat or pass by the shrapnel-indented\nwestern wall of the Victoria and Albert\nmuseum is not a city anyone can be so\narrogant as to claim to own or belong\nto. It\u2019s a terrifying, dominating and\nunstoppable city. Our admiring may\nbe done while crawling the kerbs and\nwalking the streets, but the metaphor\nstops there.\nAs we are breathlessly carried along\nin its wake, all we can do is look after it\nfor the next lucky generation.\nIf London was a call girl (or maybe not)\nGilead Amit\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24 felix Friday 10 October 2008\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Zuzanna Blaszczak\nLegendary hunks playing legendary outlaws.\nButch and Sundance\nWhile writing this review I wonder,\nhow many of the people reading the\nFelix film section have seen this classic movie. Half of you? The problem\nwith famous old films is that everyone\nknows about them or has, somehow\nor other, heard of them. How is that\na problem you might rightfully ask.\nWell, the problem is that these movies become cultural references used all\naround us but are seldomly watched\nby our generation. Speculating away,\nI am risking a statement that over the\nsummer I became one of the few of\nour readers to have spent the most enjoyable two hours of their lives in front\nof a TV screen, being blown away by\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\nto the wild wild west of the US of A.\nFor those few of you who don\u2019t know\nthe story, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert\nRedford) are a pair of outlaws in the\nWild West, known throughout the dry\nand yellow country for their love of\nbank robbing and terrorising of trains.\nAnd love is exactly the word I wanted\nto use, because one of the main things\nfueling the story and the movie is the\nobvious fondness for what they are doing that emanates from the two anti-heroes. At the start of the film Butch,\nSundance and their Hole in the Wall\ngang enjoy a fairly peaceful life of law\nbreaking, knowing that Butch\u2019s wits\nand Sundance\u2019s mastery of the pistol\nhas put them out of reach of the local\nlaw enforcement, that is of course until the day when a special unit is creat-ed, trained and sent out to track them\ndown and \u2018deal\u2019 with the notoriously\ngentle robbers. A simple story, isn\u2019t it?\nBanal even. But the execution - that\u2019s\nwhere this film dazzles.\nFirst off - the cinematography. Conrad Hall, who won Oscars for American Beauty and Road to Perdition was\nfirst recognised for his portrayal of the\ngreat American expanse of nothing in\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\nIt could be that the wild west is in itself\nso beautiful that the shots are breathtaking even in sepiatone, but I think it\ntakes a master\u2019s touch to evoke a sense\nof belonging in that desolate land.\nBut the heart and soul of the movie is\nfound in the friendship and camaraderie between the two outlaws. Redford\nand Newman give the performances\nThis time Felix ignores the new releases bombarding the\ncinemas to give you a closer look at a must see classic.\nof their lives, proving that good acting doesn\u2019t equal tears and drama on\nthe screen. Good acting puts a smile\non your face, pulls you in, gives you\na glimpse of what it\u2019s like to be Butch\nand Sundance, takes you along for an\nunforgettable adventure.\nNever pass a chance of watching\nthis gem, you\u2019ll regret it.\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nWelcome to the\nFilm Cynic Clinic\nW\nhere am I again?\nAs if you hadn\u2019t\nheard it enough\nalready, and just in\ncase you\u2019d forgot-ten, welcome to Imperial! Over the\ncourse of the next few weeks you will\nproceed through a series of ancient\nrituals and rites, as you are enrolled\ninto the wonderful congealed mass\nthat is Imperial College London. You\nwill learn hundreds, potentially millions of new names and faces, each of\nwhich you will subsequently forget.\nYour Facebook account will swell beyond reasonable proportions, full of\npeople you\u2019ll probably never speak to\nagain, communicating only with polite,\nembarrassed smiles as you pass them\non the walkway.\nYou\u2019ll discover why your Student\nHall only had one tiny photo on the\nwebsite, and as you sign the six-figure\nrental contract you\u2019ll understand what\nliving in London truly means. You\u2019ll realise that your generous Student Loan\nwill buy you at least two loaves of bread\nfrom Waitrose (organic, fair-trade,\nhealing bread mind you) and that you\ncan afford to go out about once every\ntwo years.\nWhere was I again? Oh yes, films.\nWonderful things really. Well apart\nfrom the crap ones. But then I suppose you could always put crap films\nin the same category as comfort food.\nPerfect for when you just can\u2019t be arsed\nand need something warm and stodgy\nto settle down with on the cold winter\nnights. Think James Bond \u2013 but with\nPierce Brosnan; think Bridget Love\nFour Hill Weddings Actually Notting\nJones or think Atonement \u2013 no wait,\ndon\u2019t think Atonement. It\u2019s probably\nincorrect to describe the Oscar-winning tragic drama as warm and stodgy.\nAs the soft rubber coating of Freshers\u2019 week begins to come off the solid\nmetal rod of teaching, you might find\nyourself in need of some mindless re-laxation. Now to avoid offending genuine Film Critics, I wouldn\u2019t dare say\nthat all films are just escapist follies.\nBut go into any HMV and you\u2019ll find\na large shelf that are. Nowadays twelve\nquid will buy you an hour and a half of\ndistraction \u2013 not a bad deal when you\nthink about it. Provided they are consumed in moderation, they can provide\nthat little piece of essential relaxation.\nAnd strangely enough, all these films\nseem to come from one place.\nYou could think of Hollywood as being a giant McDonalds, churning out\nslabs of reconstituted horse packaged\nin a cheerful bright box. \u201cI\u2019ll have a Big\nMacandfries\u201dtranslatesapproximately\ninto \u201cany of those films with Will Ferrell\nin and throw in a bit of Ben Stiller on\nthe side\u201d. When you open the things up\nthey\u2019re hideous affairs of the congealed\nremains of Z-list actors, fused together\nwith the sickly sauce of Hollywood\u2019s\nbodily fluids. If you\u2019re lucky you might\nget a bit of cheese chucked in, in the\nform of a veteran comedian, like Leslie\nNielsen. But most of the time you\u2019ll be\nleft feeling short-changed.\nHowever, like the fatty fast-food forays of McDonalds, you\u2019ll keep finding\nyourself late one night lured to the\nglowing light of the DVD player. You\nknow how dreadful it really is, you\nknow that it\u2019ll never satisfy you in the\nlong run, but you still keep going back.\nWhy? Because every once in a while, it\ntastes so damn good.\nImportant Reminder:\nRemember to pay your TV licence. Especially if you don\u2019t have a TV. Because\nif you don\u2019t you will automatically become a smaller addition to the Axis\nof Evil, slightly below Iran but above\nNorth Korea. For those living in halls,\nwho are yet to receive their death writ\nfrom the TV Licensing Agency, be pre-pared. The agency tends to avoid using\nthe widely accepted principle, innocent until proven guilty, and assumes\nyou are a cheating, signal grabbing\ncriminal. Still, it\u2019s nice to know that\nsomeone is looking after our vulnerable state media.\nIn cinemas Simon Pegg teaches us how to lose friends and alienate people\nFor reasons unknown even to me I expected more from Simon Pegg\u2019s newest\ncomedy How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. And I wonder why, after all\nit is a Simon Pegg movie and Hot Fuzz\nshould have been indication enough of\nwhat to look out for in this, let\u2019s just\nsay, fairly well publicised release.\nMaybe the reason I expected more\nis the story. The rise and fall of a British journalist (Simon Pegg) making his\nway in a New York magazine devoted\nto the life of stars promised to be new,\noriginal even. A perfect way to give us\nan inside view of how celebrities are\ncreated. And, because it\u2019s a comedy, I\nenvisioned a movie dripping with cyni-cism, wit and with a spice of bitterness\n- precisely the feelings that come to\nmind when looking at another \u2018shocking\u2019 photo in the London Lite. Obviously I misunderstood the tag lines.\nHence my surprise, because How\nto Lose Friends and Alienate People\nis very much a laugh out loud type of\ncomedy with stuff/people falling over,\ncute dogs dying funny deaths and the\nmain character treating the audience to\nnumerous ludicrous facial expressions.\nAnd although there is a noticeable lack\nof satire, the dialogues are worth men-tioning. If you\u2019ve been to the cinema\nrecently you probably recall the \u2018please\nturn off your mobile phones\u2019 spots by\nOrange mobile where a panel of guys\nlistens to actors trying to sell their idea\nfor a movie. If you enjoy the inappro-priate, rude and disarmingly hilarious sentences that leave their mouths\nyou will laugh shamelessly at Sidney\nYoung\u2019s remarks and the fact that any\nof his attempt at an effective wisecrack\nends in the room going quiet.\nThat\u2019s what kind of humour to ex-pect. Now about the acting. Joining Simon Pegg in his ventures in the Sharp\nMagazine and the New York high-life\nare Kirsten Dunst (the love interest),\nGillian Anderson (the bitchy publicist\nEleanor), Megan Fox (the clueless ce-Zuzanna Blaszczak lebrity that every guy, including Sidney, dreams of), Danny Houston (the\n\u2018bad guy\u2019 and Sidney\u2019s love rival) and\nJeff Bridges (the boss whose nostalgia\nfor his student years allows Sidney to\nkeep his job). I\u2019m sorry to say that both\nDunst and Houston are pretty bland\nand forgettable. For that I blame the\nfact that Kirsten has a girl-next-door\nlook and persona that, while cute,\ndoesn\u2019t stand out. Danny Houston on\nthe other hand didn\u2019t bring enough\nlife to the stereotypical character he\nplays and his big, straight posture only\ndeepens the impression of looking at a\ncardboard cut out. But Jeff Bridges and\nGillian Anderson come out shining despite their limited \u2018on air\u2019 time. With\none look Anderson manages to make\nit crystal clear that Eleanor is a cold,\ncalculating beast that gets what she\nwants. While Simon Pegg shows again\nthat to do comedy you need to leave\nself-consciousness outside the door.\nIf Fresher\u2019s Week depressed you, this\nmovie is a cure I would recommend. Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst make for an unlikely couple\nWelcome to a new year at Imperial and\na new year of Clubs & Societies. We\u2019ve\njust had our biggest Clubs & Societies\nevent of the year \u2013 Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nA big thank you to all the Clubs &\nSocieties, organisers, volunteers and\nof course all the students who came\nfor making this year\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Fair our\nbiggest and most successful ever!\nDespite last minute changes of the plans\ndue to forecasted bad weather (which\nin true British tradition almost failed to\nmaterialise), over 6,000 students came to\ncampus to visit the 340 stalls, talk to Clubs\n& Societies, sign up to mailing lists, pick up\nfreebies and get involved in all the amazing\nthings that the Union has to offer.\nThere was a great atmosphere\nthroughout the whole campus, both in\nCollege and over the road in the Union.\nThe Main Dining Hall and Ante Room\nwere buzzing with Arts and Social clubs\nas well as numerous external companies.\nJust outside the Main Dining Hall in the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn Car Park were all the\nFaculty Union mascots.\nIn the Great Hall all of our overseas Clubs\nand Societies showcased their individual\ncultures and customs with some of\nthe most lively and colourful stalls on\ncampus.\nThe relocated RSM and CGCU clubs\nswelled the numbers in the JCR which\nalso housed the food and drink and\ngaming societies.\nUpper Dalby Court not only had its own\nisolated gale-force weather conditions,\nbut a lot of the outdoors Sport Clubs as\nwell as Gliding club who brought one of\ntheir gliders along for all to see. The rest\nof the Sports clubs filled the Business\nSchool Foyer which was packed with\neager students all day and proved a highly\nsuccessful rain-based contingency plan.\nOver the road in the Union, things\nwere no less busy. The stage in the\nBeit Marquee was used to showcase a\nhuge variety of clubs all day, including\na Fencing demo, a Kendo martial\narts demo and even a bit of audience\nparticipation with a Boat Club race-off supervised by ex-Olympian Steve\nTrapmore! Beit Quad also saw its first\nhigh-striker, organised by the Royal\nCollege of Science Union.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the crowds in\nthe Union had plenty to see with all the\nadventure sports and media clubs in the\nMarquee bringing along their assorted\nequipment, cameras and televisions, as\nwell as all the charity, social, religious\nand martial arts clubs who were housed\nin the rest of the Union building.\nThis year, Freshers\u2019 Fair did not just stop\nat 4pm. It continued in the Beit Marquee\nwith the Freshers\u2019 Fair Afterparty and a\nstage show featuring great music and\ndance performances from Chamber\nChoir, Classical Guitar, String Ensemble,\nMusical Theatre, Dance Company,\nGospel Choir, Afro-Caribbean, Hindu\nSociety, Funkology, Capoeira and Dance\nClub. The show also featured a fair bit of\naudience participation with a free salsa\nlesson proving to be lots of fun.\nThe night was finished off in great style\nwith Jazz & Rock showcasing one of\ntheir student bands and Music Tech\nclosing the show with their student DJs.\nThe whole night was brilliantly compered\nby one of our very own students: Billy\nFeenan and teched by Dramsoc.\nThere are many people without whose\nhelp and efforts in the run-up to the\nevent and on the day, Freshers\u2019 Fair\nsimply could not have happened. My\nthanks go to all the Clubs & Societies\nCommittee Execs and Faculty Union\nExecs who turned up at 7:30am to help\nset up, all the clubs who turned up\nand made it a great day, everyone who\nhelped tidy up and of course, all the\nstudents who came along to the Fair\nand made it what it was. Thanks also\nto all the clubs and Billy Feenan who\nput in so much effort and wonderful\nperformances to make the Afterparty the\nmost successful Freshers\u2019 Tuesday night\never!\nMy thanks also go to all the members\nof College who didn\u2019t have to help\nstudents take over campus, but did! To\nPaula Consiglio for letting us use the\nCar Park; Terry Branch and the Security\nteam and Tim Ashton, Peter Seal and\nthe Fire Officers who kept us safe all\nday and who were so understanding\nwith the change of plans; Courtney\nRichards, Steve Fooks, Graham Watson\nand their teams from Estates; Neil\nMosley, Nick Gore, Grant Danskine,\nAlissa Ayling and all the Sport Imperial\nteam who looked after the Business\nSchool Foyer; the receptionists at the\nCollege Main Entrance; Iain Reid, the\nEthos receptionists,\nthe Student Hub\nTeam and the\nCommunications\nTeam along with\nPamela Michaels\nwho helped us\ndistribute the Wet Weather Plans and let\nall the students know what was going\non; Emily Moss in the Conference Office\nand the Conference Office staff for all\ntheir help in booking things and helping\nto set-up on the day; Ian Morris for all\nhis help in the Sir Alexander Fleming\nBuilding; Ian Gillett for coming along\nto speak to all the clubs at the Club\nOfficers\u2019 Introductory Talk and Rodney\nEastwood for letting us use the Business\nSchool Foyer.\nMy special thanks to Paddy Jackman\nand Jane Neary for all their help both\nin the run-up to the Fair and on the day\n- without them so many clubs would\nhave been displaced without anywhere\nto go. Thank you for letting us take over\nthe JCR on one of your busiest days, for\nhelping us out in our moment of need\nand thanks also to the JCR staff for\nbeing so patient as hundreds of students\ntook over the room on Tuesday! The\nwhole Union owes you all a huge debt of\ngratitude.\nWe hope that you all enjoyed the Fair and\nthat you got the chance to see and meet\nall the Clubs & Societies that Imperial\nhas to offer.

Your future is literally\ndisappearing by the second.\nAs you pile up your student debt\nwith nights out at Boujis or trips to the\nV&A or dinner out with your friends\nyou wouldn\u2019t be blamed for thinking\nthat it\u2019ll all be fine when you get your\nhigh-flying job in the city.\nSure the 26 hour days will almost\nkill you and the huge amount of time\nyou \u2018ll spend with people who only talk\nabout the markets will chip away at\nyour soul bit by bit until you\u2019re a shell\nof your formal self. But all that doesn\u2019t\nmatter, what matters is that you\u2019ll have\na really hot suit and tons of cash.\nThe greedy U.S. homeowners/Barack\nObama/the free market has a different\nplan for you however. Instead you\u2019ll be\nforced to send your worthless, boring\nCV that doesn\u2019t do anything except\ndisplay your abysmal lack of intern-ships, to an ever diminishing number\nof banks who will only be able to offer\nyou \u00a330,000 a year job with NO PERKS.\nScared? You should be.\nThere is no hope. However if you\nreally insist on putting your 4 years of\nscientific education to waste and pursue a selfish lifestyle instead of helping\nmankind through scientific research\nthen you should do a few things.\n1. Get comfortable in a suit, employers can sense when you\u2019re uncomfort-able. Wear a suit everyday, even wear it\nto bed. Become one with the suit.\n2. Spend every free moment you\nhave doing internships, what do you\ndo when your lectures finish? You go\nmake coffee for an MD at Citibank\n3.

Boat rac-es, matchbox, fives, and the chanting\nall supplemented the sports played on\nWednesday in a good hearted fashion.\nFor those of you who couldn\u2019t make\nit to the trials or are still contemplating which sport to play needn\u2019t worry,\nsome clubs are running a second day of\ntrials in the near future and most run\nearly/midweek training sessions during the season. Contact the relevant\nclub captains for more information.\nThose of you in teams already, fixtures\nstart as early as Monday so bring your\nA-Game to the table and do IC proud!\nStill contemplating joining a sport?\nExperience the camaraderie and\nthe (level 5) banter at the union on a\nWednesday and rest assured your decision will be made easier, more so if\nyou spent the \u00a36 entry fee on beers\ninstead!\nRugby tackle Argentina\nThe tourists departed in two groups,\none group early on Sunday morning\nand the others later that afternoon.\nChumble (Richard Simons) thought it\nappropriate to stay in a hotel next to\nthe airport the night before. Despite\nhis best efforts and the 3 or 4 wake up\ncalls delivered by members of the touring party, Chumble was late... \u201cWon\u2019t\nhappen again\u201d he promised.\nThe touring party was reunited in\nBuenos Aires, the first day was spent\ngetting over jet lag and consuming copious amounts of steak. Player/coach,\nwell more coach, Jovan Nedic summed\nup the good exchange rate and cheap\nsteak with what was to become the\ntour phrase, \u201cI\u2019m so happy\u201d. The phrase\ncould be likened to his mood on and\noff the pitch for the duration of tour!\nAfter a day of touristy activities the\nteam had their first training session in\nthe evening of the second day. Needless to say the team was a little rusty.\nThe first match was against San Antonio on the outskirts of B.A. After a\nsuperb match, brilliantly controlled by\nfly half Kieran Burge, IC were victorious with Malcolm Simm being named\nas Man of the Match. The third half\nas the Argentines called it, involved\nhuge slabs of deliciously cooked meat\nwashed down with lots of beer and\nthe controversial Fernet (Argentine\nMarmite equivalent in alcoholic form).\nMark \u201cFour day hard on\u201d Saleme demolished the language barrier demonstrating why Lebanon should be\ngranted accession to the World Trade\nOrganisation. Half way through the\nfestivities, Chumble disappeared,\nprompting one of our hosts to come up\nwith the gem, \u201cD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 CHUMBley\u201d. Chumble was discovered asleep\non the 68 seater, double decker tour\ncoach commissioned for our services\nby Joe Harris. Once Anjit had finished\ncoaching the girls u16\u2019s hockey team,\nthe two sides boarded the love bus to\nhead to a club. After departing the\ncoach, Joe Harris was violently assaulted by an act of revenge by an Argentine\ngrandma, his favourite shirt was never\ngoing to be the same again after being\ndrenched in bleach. After the beast had\nbeen calmed the two sides proceeded\nto what looked like Paradise Island.\nArgentine clubs tend not to get going\nuntil late, and this place was no excep-tion. After we got suitably lubricated,\nthe huge club started to pack out and\nKieran Burge made a cameo appearance to the stage show (two stunners\nand one midget in a gimp mask\u2026). The\nboys crawled home in dribs and drabs\nat all hours of the morning for reasons\nonly known to themselves.\nAfter B.A the tour headed to Mendoza, where we were due to play the same\nteam twice. On the way there, the tour\nbus had a fight with a dog. The tour\nbus emerged victorious, poor dog. To\ngive us a chance to really experience\nArgentine culture we stayed with our\nhosts the night before the first game.\nThe first thing my host said to me in\nvery broken English was \u201cYou like par-ty? You like girls? You right place\u201d We\nknew it was on. The Argentine\u2019s didn\u2019t\ndisappoint; they had organised a house\nparty for us at one of the hosts. At the\nhouse lots of young lassies turned up\nand Bevis was unstoppable, \u201cHola\nChicas\u201d was being thrown around like\nknickers at a Prince concert, whilst JJ\nwas thoroughly getting his friend on.\nThe Fernet was being demolished. The\ntwo teams headed out to a local club at\nabout 1am where mayhem was to en-sue. I am not at liberty to disclose what\nhappened next (I have no recollection)\nbut some ridiculous shapes were cut,\n\u201chalf head\u201d was attained and other\nforms of debauchery occurred. When\neveryone arrived at the match in dribs\nand drabs at 12.45 for our 1 o\u2019clock K.O\nwe felt the Argentines had played a cruel trick on us. Nick Johnstone, Anjit,\nJames Pettit and Tom Coggrave made\nthem pay in the loose, whilst Thomas\nCarroll gave a master class in \u2018Smash n\nBosh\u2019. Needless to say the victory was\nsweet but we still had things to work\non. After chilling out in Mendoza, raft-ing, wine tasting and cactus wrestling\nwe returned for our second match\nwhich was not going to be as easy. Captain for this match, Chumble, lead with\na barrage of pointless and misguided\nmotivational speeches. \u201cCan we stand\nin the sun, I\u2019m cold in the shade\u201d and\n\u201cBoys keep the language down, there\nare children around\u201d. Jovan made his\nfirst and only appearance to the tour\nside and had to be restrained and substituted after 20 minutes. This was a\nhard match, TC and Howard demonstrated some superb defence. Kieran\nhad to depart through injury, leading\nAlex Johnstone to be ushered to fullback and the immeasurable Freddie\nChalk going to 10. Good work from\nMalcolm, Bevis, McFadge, Jack Goring\nand Badger in the tight gave Freddie\nthe platform to launch his lightning attacks with great lines from Joe Harris\nand Sasha Maitala all performing to\nclinch the win. Man of the Match Anjit\nhad a superb all round performance.\nDuring the post match celebrations\nChumble stole himself a couple of moments to psyche himself up for the\ncaptain\u2019s speech, which he delivered\nelegantly. After saying our goodbyes\nwe headed off for the overnight trip to\nCordoba.\nOur departure was not without\nevent, Borja (the only Spanish speaker\namongst us) decided that it was ap\nAlex Johnston\nICURFC Tour Secretary\nContinued on page 39\nICHC hit Germany...\n\n"

And in the mountains we\ndefinitely were, on the Fellwanderers\u2019 2008 summer tour to Jotunheim\nNational Park in Norway, home to\nthe highest mountains in Northern\nEurope. The plan was to complete\na circuit of the park\u2019s central region\nover a nine day period, hopefully\nbagging Norway\u2019s highest mountain\non the way. (And dodging the trolls,\nobviously.)\nAnd so it was that, thanks to the\nmagic of Ryanair (who optimistically define Stanstead as a \u2018London\u2019\nairport), a group of eleven bleary-eyed fellwanderers were to be found\nqueuing up in the departure lounge\nat 4.30am, one Tuesday morning in\nJuly.\nDespite hernia-inducing overweight rucksacks and the presence of\nfive kilos of porridge mix (granular\nwhite powder in unmarked clear plastic bags - oh dear), everyone made it\nto the plane intact, and we were soon\nwandering around Oslo taking in the\nsights. Oslo actually achieves the rare\ndistinction of being one of the few\ncities more expensive than London,\nfortunately the prison-like Anker\nHostel (suggested corporate slogan:\nResistance Is Useless) and the local\nSubway franchise enabled everyone\nto make it to the bus the following\nmorning feeling reasonably human.\nA five hour drive north put us by\nthe shores of 18km long Lake Gjende,\nat the Gjendesheim road-head and\nhut, where Dave, Jon and Nathaniel\npromptly jumped in. And regretted\nit, unsurprisingly - Gjende is 1000m\nabove sea level and fed mostly by glacial meltwater!\nApart from the spectacular scen-ery, one of Jotunheim\u2019s most attractive features is that there are no roads\nwithin the park boundaries, nor any\npermanent inhabitants apart from\nthe staff of the mountain huts. So although only extending over 3900km2\n, there\u2019s a real feeling of isolation.\nNot that we felt very isolated the next\nmorning;\nOur first day\u2019s hike, from Gjendesheim to Memurubu, included the\nBessegen ridge. One of Norway\u2019s most\npopular hiking trails, the day consisted of a steep 740m climb onto the\nVeslfjellet ridge, which in turn drops\ndown a steep, exposed scramble onto\nBessegen proper, a narrow spine of\nrock separating Lakes Bessvatn and\nGjende. Bessvatn is about 10m below\nthe ridge \u2013 and Gjende is about 400m\nbelow, down a sheer cliff face. A great\nscramble and even better views, even\nif half of Norway seemed to be on the\nridge at times! (Very attractive they all\nwere too \u2013 definitely more so than the\ndenizens of the average UK mountain.)\nWe did note, though, that we seemed\nto have bigger rucksacks than anyone else \u2013 something that got harder\nand harder to ignore as we completed\nthe final climb and then long descent\ndown to Memurubu hut, halfway along\nthe northern shore of Lake Gjende.\nAs the mountain huts can often be\nexpensive, we\u2019d opted to carry tents\nand about half of our food - this kept\nthe trek affordable, but there were\ndefinitely times when all the gear just\nseemed far too heavy!\nAfter packing the tents, the next day\nwas definitely less spectacular than the\nfirst; a long, tiring slog alongside another lake, Russvatn, and then over a\ncol to the hut at Glitterheim. An Indiana Jones style footbridge over a gorge\nprovided a diversion and some amusing video footage, but by the time we\nreached Glitterheim some members\nof the group were clearly struggling,\nsummer term dissertations and exams\nhaving taken something of a priority\nover fitness! It was decided to reduce\nthe planned route by skipping the hut\nat Skogadalsboen, and having a rest\nday at Glitterheim. Fortunately, the hut\nwas operated by the DNT (Norwegian\nHiking Association) and so was cheap\nto sleep in, especially as we could provide our own food \u2013 in this case, my\nfamous \u2018Meaty pasta with meat sauce\u2019.\nCritical reviews were, well, critical;\nEvelyne succinctly described it as \u2018dogfood\u2019. Still, it did the job.\nAfter a day of card playing, we bid\ngoodbye to our bunk-room and headed onwards to the road-head and large\nhut complex at Spiterstulen. Gorgeous\nweather and a pleasant ascent of the\ncol at Veslglupen gave way to torrential rain in the last hour of descent to\nthe hut; our original plan to camp was\nhastily discarded as we negotiated a\ngroup discount for a bunk-room. This\nwas easier than it sounds; although\nnone of us could tell Norwegian from\nalphabet soup, everyone we met spoke\nbetter English than we did, frankly.\nWe planned to stay two days at Spiterstulen, both to try and summit Galdhoppigen (Norway\u2019s highest mountain\nat 2469m), and also to try and get a\ncloser look at some of the glaciers in\nthe area. So the next morning about\ntwo thirds of the group assembled for\nan early breakfast before starting up\nthe trail to Galdhoppigen (literally, \u201cBig\nPeak\u201d- imaginative types, these Norwegians). Total ascent from Spiterstulen to the summit is 1363m \u2013 in other\nwords, the climb to the top is greater\nthan the entire height of Ben Nevis, the\nUK\u2019s tallest mountain, from sea level! A\nsteep walk followed by the crossing of a\nlarge snowfield put us at the base of the\nsummit ridge, and a couple of hundred\nmetres scramble over loose scree and\nboulders put us on the eastern end of\nthe summit ridge at Svellnose, about\n220m below the main summit, which\nwas about a kilometre away along a\nfairly narrow ridge. Unfortunately, the\nweather, which had been overcast all\nmorning, was rapidly closing in, and\nFellwanderers battle trolls,\nImperial fellwanderers took a summer trip to Jotunheim National Park in Norway,\nChristopher Mark reports on their adventures\nmountains and reindeer in a tin\n\u201cVery attractive\nthey all were\n\u2013 definitely\nmore so than\nthe denizens of\nthe average UK\nmountain\u201d\n\u201cDinner\nfeatured tinned\nreindeer, while\nbreakfast was\npackets of a\ndried porridge\ncalled \u2018Grott\u2019 \u201d\nwith visibility dropping we decided not\nto continue along the ridge, which had\na lot of snow cover. With hindsight, we\nregretted our early start; the weather\ncleared up by late afternoon, and with\nbetter visibility we probably would\nhave had the confidence to reach the\nsummit. Still, the herd of reindeer\nwe encountered halfway down partly\nmade up for it.\nThe next day Mairead, Joe, Jon,\nYvonne and Catarina decided to join\na guided group to go walking on the\nSvellnos glacier, hiring crampons from\nthe hut. Roped together, they got a\ngreat look at some crevasses and ice-pillars close up. Dave, Anna, Nathaniel and myself meanwhile decided to\nhike out to have a look at the northern\ntongue of the Veobrean glacier. Without the equipment to get onto the glacier itself safely, we settled for a quick\ngame of poker on a flat rock by the glacier\u2019s snout. Extreme poker \u2013 could be\nnext year\u2019s big thing.\nPutting Spiterstulen behind us, the\nnext day saw us pushing up the valley\nto the hut and roadhead at Leirvassbu.\nThe valley walls on each side towered\nat least 1000m above us for the first\nfew kilometres, making for a gentle but\nspectacular walk to Kyrkjeglupen, right\nbeneath the mountain known as Kyrka\n(\u201cChurch Steeple\u201d), named for its spec\u201cExtreme poker\n\u2013 could be next\nyear\u2019s big thing \u201d\ntacular near-vertical summit pinna-cle. Camping beside Leirvassbu hut at\n1400m, we finished the last of the food\nwe\u2019d brought with us, while a copy of\nthe board game Risk (in Norwegian)\ninside the hut allowed everyone to unleash their inner tyrant to their heart\u2019s\ncontent.\nLeaving Leirvassbu, the weather, already sunny, was perfect; we crested\nthe low col above the hut to reveal the\nmost gorgeous views down the snow-covered Langdalen valley to Himalayan-looking mountain ridges in the\ndistance, under a perfect blue sky. The\nday\u2019s hike was relatively short, over alternating snowfields and talus slopes\nto a very steep snow-covered slope\nleading up to a col immediately before\nOlavsbu- our destination for the night.\nThe hut was small and wonderfully\nremote; washing facilities included\na deluxe river pool by the front door,\ncomplete with bobbing rafts of ice\nwhich hadn\u2019t yet thawed. Needless to\nsay most of the group went straight for\na mind-numbingly cold dip, followed\nby an attempted group photo sitting\non the largest ice raft. Unfortunately\nit wasn\u2019t quite thick enough to take\nthe weight of Dave, the first person to\nreach it, who sat poised on the edge for\na moment before disappearing through\nit with a startled yelp.\nDinner and breakfast were provided\nby the hut; unlike the others we used\nOlavsbu was \u201cself-service\u201d, meaning\nthat you helped yourself to a selection\nof tins and packets and paid for it all\nin an honesty box. Dinner featured\ntinned reindeer and a brand of tinned\nvegetables called \u2018Sodd\u2019, while breakfast\nwas packets of a dried porridge called\n\u2018Grott\u2019 (appropriate name!).\nBidding a fond farewell to Olavsbu\nand it\u2019s magical location (and slightly\nless magical \u201ctraditional toilets\u201d \u2013\nthink wooden seat over a large box) we\ndescended through rotting snowfields\nand, lower down, a birchwood carpeted with flowers to reach Gjendebu,\nour final hut, at the western end of\nLake Gjende. Shortly after we reached\nit, I was ambushed coming out of the\nbunkhouse and dropped in the lake \u2013 a\ntraditional Fellwanderers way of saying thank you to a trip organiser. Still, I\nmanaged to drag next year\u2019s president,\nNathaniel, in with me \u2013 if I was going\nin, so was he!\nSadly, that was the end of our Norway adventure; a boat the next morning took us the length of Gjende back\nto Gjendesheim and the bus connection to civilisation, and a return to\nStanstead via a bar in Oslo. We\u2019d hiked\n88km not including the side trips to\nGaldhoppigen and the glaciers. A\nfantastic trip and thanks in no particular order to Nathaniel, Dave, Anna,\nMairead, Catarina, Joe, Jonathan,\nYvonne, Evelyne and Nick for making\nit so memorable!\nSitting looking over the pictures\nweeks later in London, I for one wish\nI was still there.\nDesigne by Alice Rowlands\n\n"

He is 24 years old\nand his dream is to study electrical engineering to a level that befits his in-tellect. The Gaza Strip\u2019s top university,\nUniversity of Gaza, only offers electric\nengineering at undergraduate level; a\ncourse that he aced as top of his class.\nHis promise as an engineer is already\napparent, he has won awards for his\ninnovative project, which allows heart\npatients to be monitored at home\nthrough an Internet link.\nThe Gaza Strip is not the best location for a student with limitless education aspirations and accordingly Zohair has sought education abroad. He\nsuccessfully applied to study at Imperial College London, starting like other\nnew students on the 4th of October.\nHe was granted a British visa without complications and also won a full\nscholarship from the Hani Qaddumi\nfoundation, a secular Palestinian charity that supports promising students,\nto fund his time at Imperial College;\nthe fees alone would be well out of the\nreach of ordinary Palestinians.\nUnfortunately Zohair is unable to\ntake up his place at Imperial. He has\nbeen unable to leave Gaza. There are\nonly two crossings through which Palestinians could, theoretically, leave the\nGaza strip. The Erez crossing, in the\nnorth of Gaza on the border with Israel\nand the Rafah crossing, in the south on\nthe border with Egypt, are both under\nIsraeli control. Zohair has been denied entry into Israel through the Erez\ncrossing and so is unable to journey to\nLondon by this route.\nThe Rafah crossing is only open sporadically and for short periods of time;\na direct result of the chaotic scenes\nthis January when Hamas tore down\nsections of the border fence separating Gaza and Egypt. 3 weeks ago, the\nRafah crossing was indeed open for a\nbrief time and Zohair rushed to the\ncrossing. After 26 hours waiting on a\nbus, he wasn\u2019t lucky enough to be one\nof the 60 students, out of around 400,\nwho made it through that day. The\ncrossing is now closed again.\nDepressingly this is not the first\ntime that Zohair has had his ambitions crushed. He applied to Imperial\nafter losing his U.S. visa for study at\nthe University of Connecticut; he had\ngained a Fulbright scholarship. In May,\nZohair was first told that his Fulbright\nscholarship had been cancelled. In an\nunexpected move, Secretary of State\nCondoleezza Rice intervened and Zohair was again hopeful that his dreams\nwould be fulfilled.\nHe was granted a series of visa interviews at the Israeli border and was\nthen granted a U.S. visa. However, ultimately his visa was then revoked on\nthe basis of Israeli evidence, which has\nnot been made public. Presumably the\nevidence, if made public, would endanger Israeli sources.\nZohair\u2019s sad story is not at all unique.\nThe 1.5 million residents of the Gaza\nStrip have been confined within the\nStrip since Hamas came to power\nin June 2007. Mr Yigal Palmor, the\nspokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, although unaware of Zohair\u2019s\nsituation specifically, told felix that the\n\u201cbasic problem is not this or that person\u201d but rather the political situation\nwithin Gaza. Hamas have become the\nde facto rulers of Gaza and as a result\n\u201crestrictions on the population as a\nwhole\u201d have been imposed. Preventing\ntravel abroad, for the most part, is one\nof these restrictions. At the core of the\nissue is the fact that, as he said, \u201cGaza\nhas become a hostile entity, ruled by\na group that have essentially declared\nwar\u201d.\nThere has been significant opposition to the effect of Israel\u2019s policy on\nPalestinian students. U.S. Secretary of\nState Condoleezza Rice said in May,\n\u201cIf you cannot engage young people\nand give them a complete horizon to\ntheir expectations and to their dreams,\nthen I don\u2019t know that there would be\nany future for Palestine\u201d. The chair of\nthe Knesset Education Committee,\nMichael Melchior said \u201cWe are a nation that for years was prevented from\nstudying \u2013 how can we do the same\nthing to another people?\u201d and also\nthat \u201ctrapping hundreds of students in\nGaza is immoral and unwise\u201d while in\nthe past Israeli cabinet ministers have\ncalled for an end to the policy of preventing Palestinian students who study\nin Israeli universities from entering\nIsrael.\nThe College, through the International Office, has taken action to help\nZohair however possible but the Office\nrefusedtogointodetailsotherthanthat\nthe Director, Dr. Piers Baker, has been\nworking hard with his contacts in the\nregion. The British Foreign Office did\nnot comment on Zohair\u2019s case specifically but said they had \u201craised the issue\nof Palestinian students with the Israeli\ngovernment\u201d on a number of occasions in the past and that they \u201cwould\ncontinue to do so\u201d in the future.\nTime is short for Zohair, students\nmust take up their place at the university within two weeks of term\u2019s start;\nwhich was the 4th of October. Given\nthat he has been accepted for a one\nyear Masters course, it is unlikely that\nregistry will allow him to attend after\nthe two week limit.\nWhile Zohair waits, it is no comfort\nfor him to know that he is not alone.\nThere are an estimated 600 students\nwho have been accepted into foreign universities in Gaza, this doesn\u2019t\ntake into account promising students\nwho have been deterred from even\napplying.\nThis is an issue that should be debated at our university and felix invites you, the reader, to send in your\ncomments.\nT\nhe case of Zohair Abu\nShaban is only the most\nrecent in a series of similar\nincidents. Many students\nfrom Gaza are not being\nallowed to travel abroad to receive the\neducation they so desperately want.\nThe state of the education system in\nthe Gaza Strip is poor and for many the\nonly option to pursue a chosen subject\nat a higher level is to go abroad. For a\ncountry under heavy economic sanctions imposed by Israel, the US, Canada and the EU this is hardly surpris-ing. It is not possible to take PhD level\ncourses and there are few courses offered at a masters level. However, there\nare organisations to help students\nstudy abroad including the Hani Qaddumi Foundation which gave Zohair\nhis scholarship for study in Britain.\nThe restrictions on the movement\nof people out of Gaza are not only reserved for students; since declaring\nGaza a \u201chostile entity\u201d in 2006, Israel\nhas blockaded the area, preventing\nthe movement of people and commercial goods in and out of the area. The\npolicy is in place to reduce the risk of\nattacks on Israeli soil and to improve\nnational security.\nIsrael\u2019s history has been fraught with\nconflict and war. Acts of aggression on\nthe part of its Arab neighbours and suicide attacks on civilians within Israeli\nborders have created a concern for security that takes precedence in Israeli\ndecision-making.\nHamas took control of the Gaza Strip\nin the general election held in 2006. Final results show that they won with 74\nseats to the ruling party Fatah\u2019s 45, providing Hamas with the majority of the\n132 available seats and the ability to\nform a majority government on their\nown. Hamas is considered a terrorist\norganisation by the Israel, the U.S. and\nthe E.U. and it has carried out attacks\non Israel for the last 20 years.\nIran\u2019s sponsorship of Hamas has\ncaused more tension between the two\ngroups; President Ahmadinejad has\nstated that Israel \u201cmust be wiped off\nthe map\u201d, though his true motivations\nremain controversial. Whatever his\nintentions, Ahmadinejad\u2019s comments\nhave created fear within Israel and his\nideological and material support of\nHezbollah and Hamas is seen as clear\nevidence of his hostility to the Israeli\nstate.\nThe current cease-fire, beginning\n19th June 2008, between Hamas and\nIsrael is shaky but holding. Israel fears\nthat Hamas is using the ceasefire to\nregroup and rearm its forces and so it\nis reluctant to change its position regarding movement in and out of Gaza.\nThere have already been breaches of\nthe cease-fire and there is no guarantee\nthat if sanctions are lifted the violence\nwill cease. Hamas has. in the past,\nmade conciliatory comments towards\nIsrael. In May 2003, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, co-founder of Hamas said that \u201cthe\nHamas movement is prepared to stop\nterror against Israeli civilians if Israel\nstops killing Palestinian civilians ... We\nhave told (Palestinian Authority Prime\nMinister) Abu Mazen in our meetings\nthat there is an opportunity to stop\ntargeting Israeli civilians if the Israelis\nstop assassinations and raids and stop\nbrutalizing Palestinian civilians.\u201d\nFor any government, the safety of its\npeople is a priority, so preventing possible terrorists from entering the state\nand sharing intelligence with foreign\nallies is a reasonable precaution. Due\nto the highly classified nature of intel-ligence, it is not possible to know what\nthe Israeli security service are worried\nabout with respect to any of the citizens of Gaza they refuse to let out or\nthose whose American visas were can-celled. It is also important to stress that\nit is very unusual for anyone to be let\nout of Gaza, so Israel allowing students\nout \u2013 a practice which happens occasionally \u2013 is generous with respect to\ntheir general policy.\nAlso while Israel has veto power over\nthe Rafah crossing at the Egyptian bor-der, responsibility must also be placed\non Egyptian shoulders. It is not in their\ninterests either to allow freedom of\nmovement in and out of a region controlled by an Islamist group; consider\nEgypt\u2019s suppression of Islamist groups\nwithin their own borders.\nThequestionofwhetherIsraelshould\nessentially punish the people of Gaza\nBackground on the issue\nstudent bloggers\nan authentic student voice\n@\n\"SF\u0001ZPV\u0001B\u0001LFFO\u0001BOE\u0001DSFBUJWF\u0001XSJUFS\u0001QSFQBSFE\u0001UP\u0001CMPH\u0001BU\u0001MFBTU\u0001PODF\u0001B\u0001\nXFFL\u0001PO\u0001UPQJD\u0001PG\u0001ZPVS\u0001DIPJDF\u0001BCPVU\u0001ZPVS\u0001MJGF\u0001BT\u0001B\u0001TUVEFOU\n0S\u0001EP\u0001ZPV\u0001BMXBZT\u0001IBWF\u0001ZPVS\u0001DBNFSB\u0001PO\u0001ZPV\u0001UP\u0001DBQUVSF\u0001UIF\u0001NPNFOU\u0001\nBOE\u0001CF\u0001XJMMJOH\u0001UP\u0001TIBSF\u0001ZPVS\u0001MJGF\u0001JO\u0001B\u0001$PMMFHF\u0001QIPUPCMPH\n8F\u00b5SF\u0001MPPLJOH\u0001GPS\u0001B\u0001UFBN\u0001UP\u0001QSPWJEF\u0001BO\u0001JOTJHIU\u0001JOUP\u0001MJGF\u0001BU\u0001\n*NQFSJBM\u0001POMJOF\u000f\n\u0001 4IBSF\u0001FYQFSJFODFT\u0001XJUI\u0001GFMMPX\u0001TUVEFOUT\n\u0001 5FMM\u0001GVUVSF\u0001TUVEFOUT\u0001XIBU\u0001VOJWFSTJUZ\u0001JT\u0001SFBMMZ\u0001MJLF\n\u0001 \u0001\n4IPX\u0001UIF\u0001$PMMFHF\u0001UISPVHI\u0001ZPVS\u0001FZFT\u0001XJUI\u0001QIPUPT\u0001BOE\u0001WJEFP\n'PS\u0001NPSF\u0001JOGPSNBUJPO\u0001BCPVU\u0001IPX\u0001UP\u0001CFDPNF\u0001B\u0001TUVEFOU\u0001CMPHHFS \u0001WJTJU\u0001\u0001\nXXX\u000fJNQFSJBM\u000fBD\u000fVL\u0010DBNQVTMJGF\u0010CMPHT\u0001\nKadhim Shubber reports on the complicated case of Zohair Abu-Shaban, a promising Electrical\nEngineering student who lives in Gaza\nas a result of Hamas\u2019 hostility is open\nfor debate.

Israel\nis left with some very difficult choices.\nIts actions are often seen as essential to\nits security, however the terrible conditions that these actions create breeds\nresentment and further violence.\nPreventing students studying abroad\ncould well be shooting itself in the foot,\nas education is a tool for peace. Allowing Gazans to access education of a\nhigh quality and at a high level could\nalso help the situation.

Roughly 54%\nof students do not think that these discounts are properly catering for their\nneeds, and do not take into account\nthe current economic climate including the pinch students may be feeling\nalongside the rest of the population.\nStudents have suggested they would\nrather see food and transport at discounted prices than perks at popular\nhigh street retailers such as TopShop\nor HMV. The poll suggests that with\nfood prices at a record high, \u201csupermarkets should be offering tailored\ndiscounts to students to help them out,\nand secure their loyalty\u201d. A struggling\nstudent is likely to favour securing\nbasic human needs such as food and\nshelter over what would economically\nbe described as \u2018luxury goods\u2019 like CDs\nor fashionable clothing. This is probably very true of any struggling Imperial student who is already dealing with\nthe highest hall prices in the United\nKingdom in an area of London that is\nanything but student friendly.\nThe NUS still has not leveraged contracts that could really help students in\nthe way that this poll suggests it needs\nto be done.

Not only is the economic system\nin turmoil but the military is under\nstrain, fighting two wars simultane-ously. A vast majority of the electorate\nbelieves that the US is on the wrong\ntrack and public sentiment toward the\ndeparting administration appears to\nverge on contempt.\nWith two debates still to come (at the\ntime of press) the battle will get more\nheated with increased advertising wars\nand a ground game pitting newly registered Obama supporters against older\nand perhaps more dependable voters\nfor McCain.\nThe landscape of American politics\nhas shifted, most noticeably in the\nMidwest, driven by the financial crisis,\nthe performance of the two candidates\nin response and increased doubts over\nAlaska Governor Sarah Palin. These\nchanges in recent weeks have favoured\nObama.\nMcCain made the abrupt decision\nlast week to take down television advertisements in Michigan and shift\nstaff to other states. The retreat from\nMichigan, a blue state once seen by\nMcCain\u2019s campaign as a prime target\nfor shifting a big industrial state to the\nRepublican column, has prevented a\nmajor blow for Obama. The economic\ndownturn, which has hit Michigan especially hard, appears to be too much\nfor McCain to overcome. Sarah Palin, McCain\u2019s running mate, disagreed\nwith this decision. \u201cOh, come on, do\nwe have to?\u201d Palin told Fox News, add-ing: \u201cI want to get to Michigan, and I\nwant to try.\u201d\nWisconsin, where Obama\u2019s once-commanding lead has dwindled, has\nseen a redoubling of McCain\u2019s efforts\nto ensure the state turning red on November 4th. However, McCain is being forced to compete in Indiana, a\nstate that has not voted for a Democrat\nsince Lyndon Johnson in 1964, where\npolls show Obama in close contention.\nMeanwhile, Obama has to pump money into Minnesota to ensure Democrats secure the state in the election.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s over, but boy, other\nthan the vice-presidential debate, you\nwould be hard-pressed to point to\nanything good that\u2019s happened to Republicans in the last three weeks,\u201d said\nCharlie Cook, editor of non-partisan\nCook Political Report.\nThe McCain campaign plans to get\naway from the financial debacle and\nback to questioning Obama\u2019s inexperience \u2013 criticisms that can more easily be rallied against Palin. Economic\nissues tend to favour Democrats, and\nMcCain\u2019s decision to abandon campaigning and rush back to Washington received mixed views. His claim\nThe final 30 days: The political landscape has changed, forcing Senators John McCain\nand Barack Obama to rethink tactics in the final stages of their campaigns.\nto return to campaigning when the\ncrisis has been averted has seemingly\nbeen forgotten, the crisis deepens yet\nMcCain is back on the hard sell; this\ntactic appears to have been a political-ly-motivated PR stunt which has not\nworked as well as his team would have\nhoped. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to turn the page\non this financial crisis and getting back\nto discussing Mr. Obama\u2019s aggressively\nliberal record and how he will be too\nrisky for Americans\u201d said Greg Strimple, a senior McCain advisor. However,\nmany Americans find the prospect of a\nMcCain presidency with Sarah Palin as\nVice-President a risky and downright\nscary prospect.\nObama campaign manager David\nPlouffe has said that they are still on\nthe offensive, hammering home the\nmessage that if voters want another for\nyears of George W. Bush\u2019s policies, they\nshould back McCain. If they want \u201cfundamental change, putting middle-class\nfirst\u201d, they should vote for Obama.\nAlthough poll numbers are not de-finitive, Obama has made large gains\namong white women, often cited as\na key component of the electorate, as\nwell as non-college-educated white\nvoters. \u201cObama\u2019s doing well among\nall the demographic groups he needs\nto win,\u201d said Peter Brown, assistant\ndirector of the Quinnipiac University\nPolling Institute, describing the Illinois\nsenator\u2019s lead as solid. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean\nthe election\u2019s over, but McCain has a\nsteep hill.\u201d\nWhit Ayres, a Republican pollster,\nsays that the race is not over. \u201cEvery\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\ntime in the past Obama has been able\nto open up a small but significant lead,\nthe McCain campaign has figured out\na way to close the gap.\u201d\nScott Reed, who ran Bob Dole\u2019s\n1996 campaign, said there\u2019s no reason\nfor Republicans to panic. \u201cIf you look\nback at the last 30 days and what we\u2019ve\nbeen through, look at how many times\nthings have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhy I still have hope.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Obama is still on the offensive in Virginia, Colorado, Florida\nand Ohio where Bush won four years\nago. \u201cWe assume all these battleground\nstates will be competitive until the very\nend,\u201d said Plouffe, cautiously describing\nhimself as \u201cpleased\u201d with the progress.\nTo win the election, Obama needs\n270 electoral votes. To reach this total,\nObama could try the one-state option,\ngoing all-out to win a big state like\nFlorida or Ohio, which would put him\nover 270 if he also held the states Kerry\nwon four years ago. On the other hand,\nObama could try the two-state strate-gy, winning Virginia and a smaller state\nsuch as Iowa or New Mexico. Obama\u2019s\nadvisors are also saying there is a three-state option, coupling wins in Iowa and\nNew Mexico with one in Colorado.\nObama has an advantage in money,\nhaving chosen not to take public funds.\nThis means he can spend as much as he\nraises whereas McCain is limited to the\nmoney he receives from the govern-ment. The Michigan decision was seen\nas a move to concentrate money where\nit counts however McCain\u2019s advisors\nsay it doesn\u2019t reflect any problems.\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nMcCain has gone on the attack in the latest \u2018townhall\u2019 style Presidential debate, focusing on Barack Obama\u2019s character\nWe have arrived comrades, at the first\npolitics section of the year. Freshers\nweek is drawing to a close, time perhaps for us to start thinking about serious matters... like the financial crisis we\nnow find ourselves in having spent the\nmajority of the week drinking ourselves\nsilly. The most common response now\nseems to be to pour ones heart and\nsoul into blaming all lifes problems on\nthe crisis that is the \u2018credit crunch\u2019.\nFor example, whilst standing at the\nUnion Bar this week, I could not help\noverhearing a conversation that made\nmy ears bleed; one young man turned\nto his friend to bemoan the price\nof snakebite increasing, his friend\npromptly and pompously reflected\nthat it was all to do with this \u201cblasted\ncredit crunch\u201d.\nSorry... what?!? It shouldn\u2019t be surprising I suppose when Paris Hilton\ngenuinely thinks that credit crunch is\nher next filming destination, and an\nImperial Fresher (you know who you\nare) was convinced that it is in fact a\ntasty cereal.\nThe point here is that this phrase is\nbandied about continuously, so much\nis said about it but very little is un-derstood, it is simply something to\ncomplain about. So how much does\nthe credit crunch actually affect us\nstudents?\nTo answer this question, I took to\nImperial\u2019s campus and the union to\ngain an insight into the student psy-che. For the most part I was treated\nwith bemused replies; \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about it...\u201d and \u201cer, its alright\u201d came flooding forth. There were\na small number of people who were\nmildly irritated at rising food prices.\nA few overseas students lamented the\nstrength of the pound decreasing as it\nmeans that they now get less Euros in\nexchange. Aside from this, the mood\nwas certainly quite uninterested.\nThroughout my wanderings, I detected a definite undertone of detach-ment, a feeling that as students we\ndon\u2019t consider ourselves to be real peo-ple, we live in a alcohol coated bubble\nabove the rest of the world, union politics becomes more important that national politics and there is sometimes\na tendency to forget about the world\nbeyond campus.\nSo, it seems that the answer to the\naforementioned question is that in\ngeneral it really does not affect us all\nthat much. Hoorah!\nIt has been a week where Gordon\nBrown has thrown money into keeping\nthe Highstreet banks afloat and staving\noff an economic apocalypse, as well as\ntrying to coax the banks into lending to\neach other again.\n\u201cThat certainly should stop the\npanic in terms of people wondering\nwhether or not the banks are safe.\u201d said\nTerry Smith, chief executive of Tullett\nPrebon. With new schemes being put\nforward continuously, it feels like the\ncrisis will never be over.\nOh well, I\u2019m booking my holiday to\nCredit Crunch for some sun and sand.\nUntil next time fellow students!\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFriday 10 October 2008 felix\nPolitics\nIsraeli Prime Minister calls for withdrawal\nEhud Olmert, who recently announced\nhis resignation, last Monday stated that\n\u201calmost all the territories, if not all the\nterritories\u201d should be handed over to\nthe Palestinians to ensure peace. This\nwill effectively reverse the occupation\nof territories gained in 1967. Olmert\nadded that the withdrawal will have to\nextend to eastern Jerusalem, the future\nseat of government for the Palestinians, a bold move as the city has long\nbeen proclaimed as Israel\u2019s \u201ceternal,\nundivided capital\u201d.\nThe Israeli Prime Minister will continue in power until a new government\nis assembled to take over on November\n3rd. Olmert announced his decision in\nJulyaftercomingundermountingpressure due to multiple corruption inves-tigations. Tzipi Livni is the likely candidate to take over the premiership.\nBoth Ehud Olmert and Defence\nMinister Ehud Barak have recently\ncalled for a tougher stance to be taken\nagainst those who attack Palestinians.\n\u201cAn evil wind of extremism, of hate, of\nmaliciousness, of violence, of losing\ncontrol, of lawbreaking, of contempt\nfor the institutions of state, is passing\nthough certain sections of the Israeli\npublic,\u201d Mr Olmert told the cabinet as\na Palestinian shepherd was killed near\nthe city of Nablus in the occupied West\nBank.\nSome, including former Meretz\nchairman Yossi Beilin believe he has\nmade a serious mistake calling for the\nwithdrawal: \u201cOlmert has committed\nthe unforgivable sin of revealing his\ntrue stance on Israel\u2019s national interest\njust when he has nothing left to lose\u201d.\nMeanwhile MK Yuval Steinitz accused Mr Olmert of gambling on Israel\u2019s future. \u201cIgnoring the distance\nbetween rockets fired from afar and\nthe enemy sitting on top of Jerusalem\nreveals how little he understands the\nbasis of security,\u201d Mr Steinitz said.\nPrime Minister Olmert furthered his\nprevious comments by saying that any\npeace deal with Syria would require\npulling out of the Golan Heights, held\nsince 1967 after the six-day war against\nSyria amongst other Arabic nations.\n\u201cWe have to reach an agreement with\nthe Palestinians, the meaning of which\nis that in practice we will withdraw\nfrom almost all the territories, if not all\nthe territories,\u201d.\nMr Olmert said. \u201cWe will leave a\npercentage of these territories in our\nhands, but will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage, because\nwithout that there will be no peace,\u201d he\nadded.\nIt appears from an interview conducted with Yedioth Ahronoth, along\nwith news that the governments of IsJames Goldsack rael and Syria have been engaged in secret talks since February 2007 and Mr.\nOlmert is hopeful that in exchange for\nsurrendering the Golan Heights, Damascus will cut its ties with Iran\nA withdrawal will most likely leave\n400,000 Israelis stranded in the occupied West Bank and another 20,000 in\nthe Golan Heights. The call for withdrawal and peace is a departure from\ncomments previously made by the\nPrime Minister, who once believed\nthat Jerusalem should wholly be within\nIsraeli territory.\nWhilst reflecting on his tenure,\nOmert was anxious to point out that he\nwas \u201cnot trying to justify retroactively\nwhat I did for 35 years. For a large\nportion of these years I was unwilling\nto look at reality in all its depth\u201d said\nOlmert.\nThe fact that Mr. Olmert not only felt\nable to make his comments, but also to\nactively show disapproval for the way\nthe situation was handled, is perhaps a\nchange in mood he was only ready to\ndiscuss once his political career was\nalready over so there could not be any\nrepercussions.\nHis recently voted successor, Tzipi\nLivni, has been more cautious than\nOlmert. Despite his brave comments,\nthere seems little hope for a peace\nagreement in the time Ehud Olmert\nhas left as Prime Minister.\nAustrian far-right steal 30% in election sparking fear of neo-Nazi resurgence\nHeinz-Christian Strache, former dental\ntechnician and bigot, has shot to dubious fame for leading his Freedom party\nto 18% of the vote in an early general\nelection last Sunday, whilst his former\nboss and mentor-cum-rival J\u00f6rg Haider led his extreme-right party Austria\u2019s\nFuture to 11%. Despite claims to the\ncontrary, Strache has been branded a\nneo-Nazi by many political opponents\nand with good reason: keeping company with banned German neo-Nazis,\nphotographedgivingthethree-fingered\nneo-Nazi salute, promising to repeal\nlaws banning Nazi revivalism, filmed\nin forests carrying arms and wearing\nmilitary fatigues, the list goes on. \u201cI\nwas never a neo-Nazi and never will\nbe\u201d Strache has insisted, yet recently\nwhile suing Viennese newspaper Profil\nfor defamation, the court ruled that he\ncould reasonably be said to display \u201can\naffinity to national-socialist thinking\u201d.\nEurope\u2019s extreme-right poster boy\nhas stirred up support mostly from\nthe 72% of Austrians who are against\nJames Goldsack inclusion within the E.U. by bashing\nBrussels. Strache\u2019s current aspiration\nis to become Chancellor then to form\na coalition with Flemish separatists,\nFrance\u2019s National Front, Bulgarian extreme nationalists and any other ex-treme-right nuts under the banner of\n\u201cEuropean Patriotic Party\u201d. However,\nthe E.U. is not his only pet hate; Strache hates Muslims. Believing \u201cVienna\nmust not become Istanbul\u201d, it is no\nwonder he plans to set up a ministry\nfor the deportation of immigrants and\nis pushing for a constitutional ban on\nSettlers march in protest of withdrawal\nFrolicking in the woods with neo-Nazi paramilitary groups left a huge grin on Strache\u2019s face\nbuilding minarets.\nLiberals reeled in Vienna as the results of the election were released, with\nProfil describing the proceedings as \u201ca\nunique case among the western democracies\u201d. One hopes this is the case\nalthough in 2002, French extreme-right\ncandidate Le Pen came a shock second\nin the Presidential elections and then\nwas last year\u2019s 4th place; perhaps liberals and left-wingers alike should be\nworried. This result in the election on\nSunday puts the extreme-right collectively comfortably ahead of mainstream conservatives Austrian People\u2019s\nparty and neck-and-neck with the Social Democrats who scraped a win. It\nwill be very difficult for any party to\nmuster a parliamentary majority, leaving the choice between inviting Strache\ninto government and forming a coalition with the Christian Democrats \u2013 a\ncoalition that collapsed in June after\nonly 18 months in office. Attempting\nthis coalition again and having it fail\ncan only serve to raise support for the\nextreme-right, putting the Social Democrats in a very difficult position.\nIn 1999 the Freedom Party, under\nHaider\u2019s command, stunned Europe\nwhen it received 27% of the vote and\na place in government. This Sunday,\nunder Strache, the combined far-right did slightly better, meaning that\nalmost one in three Austrians voted\nextreme-right. Since his youth Strache\nhas been heavily influenced by and involved with far-right politics; he was\nonce engaged to the daughter of one\nof the founding members of the Austrian Branch of Germany\u2019s neo-Nazi\nNational Democratic party. A master\nof P.R., Strache managed to become\na Vienna City councillor in the early\n1990s using a combination of Haider\u2019s\ntechniques: snappy dressing, outrageous soundbites and populist rabble-raising, entertaining the people. The\nleader at the time, Haider, quit in 2005,\nleaving Strache to continue running\nthe party while he effectively retired,\nbefore staging a comeback on Sunday.\nStrache is widely accepted as more\naggressive and rightwing than Haider,\nhe insists on calling himself a patriot.\n\u201cThirty percent for people who portray\nnational socialism as innocuous,\u201d wrote\ncommentator Hans Rauscher, summing up \u201cwho toy with anti-semitism\nand develop contacts with the Serbian\nradical party whose leader, Vojislav\n\u0160e\u0160elj, is in the dock at the war crimes\ntribunal in The Hague. Austria is tops\nagain\u201d.\n\n"
