    "content": "the tunnel however, in t ne enlightened article you\nprinted by Mr Steve\nMarshall. He encourages us\nto throw Ind Soc out of\nCollege with a kick up the\nbackside. His illuminating\nargument show how this\norganisation is effectively\nusing IC Union to\nbrainwash students into a fixed and mindless way of\nthinking. But what of the\npolitical societies? ICU\nstands strong in being a non-political union working\nfor students and not getting\ntangled up in the usual\npointless irrelevant student\nunion issues. These people\nare not working in our\ninterests at all, they are\nseeking to utilise the\nstudent population to their\nadvantage. I appeal to the\nUnion KICK THEM OUT!\nSAVE THE MONEY WE\nGIVE THEM.\nDon't get me wrong I believe the Union needs\nhealthy and active\ndiscussion forums and\ncampaign groups. But I suggest your readers'\nenergies are better\nploughed into apolitical\nthings like Debating Soc,\nIC Amnesty International\nand Wellsoc. Out should go\nthe likes of Soc Soc, Con\nSoc, Ind Soc, SDP Soc,\nRaving Vegans for a Monetarist invasion of\nNicaragua Soc etc. We do\nnot need such grasping\nsocial leeches trying to\nlead us into ideological\nblind alleys and outdated\ndogmatism. If the Union\nneeds to become involved\nin external politics it can do\nso through the U GM. If it\nwants to hear outside\nspeakers there are all sorts\nof societies who will still\ninvite them. And if the\nworst comes to the worst\nand students want to join\npolitical parties then they\nare better off doing so\noutside college where they\nwill meet a broader\nselection of people with the\nsame narrow minded views.\nPerhaps this way we will\ncut down on silly notions\nabout banana republics and\nfree market student unions\nwhich are about as relevant\nto Union meeting business\nas a terminal overdose of\nsleeping pills. I therefore\nurge you to support a motion at an IC UGM\ninstructing the Union to\npurge itself of all\norgans at ions which\nsuppress or restrict free\nthought, to cut off their\nfunding s( and anything else\nappropriate) and to prevent\ntheir nauseating posters\nlittering our walls.\nYours sincerely\nMark Cottle\nCiv Eng 2\nBrowned Off\nSir,\nHaving been present at the\nDebating Society's 'Question Time' debate on\nTuesday lunchtime, I was\nrather interested in some of\nex-Consoc chairman\nGraham Brown's comments\nas the debate founded on\nthe subject of sanctions\nagainst South Africa\nOne of his most\ninteresting remarks was\nthat the aim of the African\nNational Congress 'is to s ii; the throat of every white\nSouth African'. However,\nthe Freedom Charter of\nSouth Africa, a document\nupon which the\nconstitution of the ANC is\nbased, states that South\nAfrica belongs to the will o: the people, and that we the\npeople of South Africa,\nblack and white\ntogether\u2014equals,\ncountrymen and\nbrothers\u2014adopt this\nCharter.'\nSince the ANC is a multiracial organisation,\nwould Graham Brown have\nus believe that it proposes\na policy of ritual mass\nsuicide of its members as a concept fundamental to the\noverthrow of apartheid?\nS Dunlop\nIC Anti-Apartheid\nPinko Pete\nSir,\nThanks are due to John\nMartin for his letter (FELIX\n717), which allows the\ndebate on Nicaragua to be\nprolonged.\nIn my letter of a fortnight\nago I referred to the\nNicaraguan government as\n'popular', a claim I thought\nun contentious, since\nSandinista candidates won\n67% of the vote in a75% turnout in last November's elections. This was,\nincidentally, a record\nturnout for Latin America:\neven the US-approved\nSalvadorean election,\nwhere voting was\ncompulsory (and they're\nvery, er, firm with law-breakers) couldn't match it.\nThat may have something\nto do with the lack of\nsocial-democratic or left-wing candia tes due to the\nthreats of far-right death\nsquads\nThe Sandinistas, on the\nother hand, have\ncommitted Nicaragua to\npluralism: opposition\nparties hold 35 of the 96\nseats in the National\nAssembly as a result of the\n1984 elections. These\ninclude Liberals and\nConservatives to the right,\nand Socialists, Communists\nand the Popular Action\nMovement to the left of the\nSandinistas. Somebody or\nother will probably point to\nthe case of the 'Democratic\nCoordinator', which refused\nto take part in the\nelections. To this I can only\ncounter firstly that the\nchoice was theirs and they\nwere under no threats from\nwithin Nicaragua, and\nsecondly that the CIA are\nknown to have approached\nthem to persuade them to\nthis decision. The\nConservative Party (that's the Nicaraguan\nConservatives) have\nrevealed that they were\ninfinitum. Hence Mr\nNewman has jumped the\ngun by producing his own\npiece of clumsy character\nas s as i nation of me and\n'those who support (my)\ncause'. I think you will find\nthat despite the inferences\nmade in Mr Newman's article that I hold very\nsimilar ideals to him on\nmany of the issues he\nraises. I would like to go on\nrecord now that I do not\nagree with hard-core\nporno gra py, apartheid and\nthe nuclear arms race.\nHowever I consider myself\nto be a bit more of a realist\nin terms of how we can\narrive at these ideals. In my\nown lengthy experience at\nIC I have meet a great\nnumber of similarly minded\npeople. Certainly, time and\ntime again, motions at\nalso offered money to\nwithdraw.\nFinally, let me return to\nDavid Ashby MP\n(Conservative) to whom I referred to in my last rant.\nHis conclusion ran thus;\n'...the electoral law was\nadequate to cover secret\nelections. I was able to\nobserve unhindered the\nelectoral process, and\ncould detect no suspicion\nof malpractice. The\nelections were properly\ncarried out'.\nYours\nPeter Hobbis\nUGMs concerning these\nissues especially banning\nHon Porn's Night and links\nwith South Africa have\nbeen consist ant ly defeated.\nI would put this move down\nto actual methods of\narriving at the ideals\ninvolved rather than the\nideals themselves. It is\nthese methods which have\nresulted in the character\nassassination of Michael\nNewman and the marty-dom he obviously revels in.\nAs a result I have no\nintention of apologizing to\nMr Newman as I have\nno th ng to ap log is e for.\nYours sincerely\nMike Jones\nNewman\nHypocrisy\nRant\nDear Hugh,\nWhilst leafing through the\nNew Collins Concise\nEnglish Dictionary I came\nacross the word 'hypocrisy'.\n'The practice of professing\nstandards, beliefs etc\ncontrary to ones real\ncharacter or actual\nbehaviour'. 'Hmmm-interesting' I thought.\nCertainly not a word one\ncould get mixed up with\nhonesty and self criticism\nas Michael P Newman\nseems to think is possible.\nHaving re-read my letter,\njust to check, I can\ndistinctly find no mention\nwhatsoever about what my\nviews are concerning the\nissues that Mr Newman\nraises; nuclear warfare,\nhuman rights, sexism,\npornography,\nvivisection is m etc. ad\nDear Hugh,\nImpressed as I am with the\nnew look FELIX and in\nparticular the consistently\nhigh standard of features I am appalled that you\nshould allow such petty\ncrassness to creep into the\nletters page. I speak of the\npolitical ranting s of the\nlikes of the infamous self-publicist Michael Newman,\nthe w hinging pink o socialist Pete Hobbis and\nthe offensively rabid right\nwinger John Martin. These\npeople are using FELIX to\nspout the unimaginative\ndogma of national political\norganisations. Worse still\nthey seem to spend most of\ntheir time and a lot ot their\nmoney just offending each\nother.\nI see a light at the end of\n2 Friday 25 October FELIX\n\n"

Perhaps\nif you just send off\nthousands of application\nforms, someone will give\nyou some sort of a job\nwhich you might enjoy.?\nNo, better just ignore the\nproblem.'. No, I know, go\nand see the Careers\nAdvisers, they'll tell you\nwhat to do.\nUnfortunately, we can't tell you what to do, we can\nhelp you towards the\ndecision, point you in the\nright direction to get you\nstarted, test out whether\nyou're being realistic but,\nultimately the decision is\nyours. You're on your own\non this one! So where do\nyou start? Well you could\nstick a pin into every third\npage of the Graduate\nRecruitement programme\nBooklet or you o cul d try to\nbe a bit more systematic\nabout it. First of all, you\ncould think about it\nyourself, try to compile a list of your characteristics\ntraits, your values, what\nyou want out of life and\nyour skills, what you're\ngood at, not forgetting of\ncourse those things that\ninterest you and that you\nenjoy. Then, when you look\nat job descriptions, you can\ncompare them with your\npersonal profile and see\nwhich ones match and hey\npresto, you know what you\nwant to do next.\nThe trouble is, it's not so\neasy to identify all these\nthings about yourself and\nso here's some tips as to\nhow you might go about it.\nLook at your life so far.\nWhy did you come to\nImperial, why are you\nreading Mathematics or\nBiology or whatever? What\nhave you enjoyed of the\nexperience why, what have\nyou hated? Was there\nanything in your holiday\njobs that you found fun or\nthat you discovered you\nwere particularly good at?\nHow about leisure interests,\nany clues there? If you\ncan't do it this way round,\ntry looking at the jobs first.\nRead as many job\ndescriptions and adverts as\nyou can and when you spot\none that takes your fancy,\ntry and analyse why it is\nthat attracts you and then\nyou can look for other\noccupations containing\nthese factors.Perhaps\nyou've seen or talked to\npeople whose jobs seem\ninteresting. Why, what was\nit about that job? Your\nCareers Advisor can help\nyou with this task or\nanalysing your skills and\nneeds by asking questions\nand checking out whether\nyou really mean it when\nyou say, for example, that\nall you care about is\nbecoming a millionaire by\ntime y or 're 30!\nThere are brief\ndescriptions in the back of\nthe Directory, 'ROGET', but\nfor more detailed\ndescriptions, consult the\nseries of booklets\npublished by the\nAssociation of Graduate\nCareers Advisory Services,\nall available free of charge\nfrom the Careers Libary.\nIf you find all this totally\nimpossible and your\nCareers Adviser can't help\nyou get started on the trail,\nthen they may re com end that you complete\nGradscope Questionaire\nwhich is a fiendishly\ningenious little toy. You\nanswer 50 questions and\nthe computer programme\ncomes up with your top ten\njobs..but alas you've still\ngot to answer the questions\n,what are you good at, what\ndo you enjoy, what do you\nwant to do next.\nHave you enjoyed yourself\nso much as a student that\nyou're thinking of going\nonto take af uther qualification? There are\nmany reasons for\ncontinuing your studies but\nmerely having enjoyed your\nundergraduate years may\nnot be an adequate motive.\nBeing a postgraduate may\nturn out to be very different\nfrom being an\nundergraduate. Are the\nelements of your\nundergraduate life that you\nhave enjoyed still present\nat postgraduate level?\nAnother pretty pathetic\nreason for taking a further\ncourse is because you can't think of anything else to do\nor because this career\nchoice business is just too\ndifficult. What's going to\nmake it easier to think of\nsomething else, or to\ndecide after another year or\nthree at College? If you just\ncontinue to study and take\nno active steps toward the\ndreaded future, you'll find\nyourself in exactly the\nsame dithering situation,\nonly slightly older!\nBut mind, the worst\nreason of all is falling prey\nto flattery. You may feel\nthat you're not susceptible\nbut come June, when you\ndegree results are out and\nnotable professors ask if\nyou'like to do a PhD with\nthem, it's so easy to be\noverwhelmed by the ideas,\nwithout thinking out the\nreality. Should this happen\nto you, beware false pride.\nBeware the professors have\nreasons of their own for\nwanting PhD student and\nbefore jumping on to three\nyear project, weigh up the\npros and cons and a nay lse whether it's really the right\nmove for you.\nBefore you get the\nimpression that I am totally\nagainst postgraduate\nstudies, here are some\nmore positive reasons for\nthis course of action, you\nmay simply not feel\nfinished with studying, the\nmore you want to learn.\nPerhaps there's a part of\nyour undergraduate course\nthat you have found\nparticularly infesting and\nwould ike to study in depth.\nMany a masters course\ncater for this need, eg\nAstrophysics.\nThe most obvious reason\nis vocational. Your chosen\ncareer may require a PhD\nor a further qualification eg\nresearch in the\nPharmaceutical industry or\nteaching. You may feel that\nit will be easier to get a job\nin your chosen field if you\npossess a further\nqualification, eg\nGeophysics or Petroleum\nEngineering. You may wish\nto change direction and\nanother course can often\nhelp, eg Information\nTechnology. Another word\nof caution is required here.\nIt's easy to be mislead into\nbelieving a course is more\nvocational than it really is.\nAdmissions tutors are sure\nto tell you how useful their\ncourses are and so make\nsure you ask what\npercentage of their\nprevious scholars are in\nemployment and what they\nare doing. You might also\nche o. nut the value of your\nchosen course with some\nof the employers at the\nCareers Fair or discuss it\nwith a disinterested person\nlike a Careers Adviser.\nHaving made the dec is on to prolong your student\ndays, the obvious next step\nis to decide where you\nwant to study. The Careers\noffice, Sherfield 309 keeps\na reference copy of,\n'Graduate Studies' which\nlists all the PhD and\nMasters and many of the\nDiploma courses available\nin the UK. We can also\npoint you in the right\ndirection for information on\nstudying aboard. The Lyon\nPlayfair library has many\nprospectuses and also\nkeeps a copy of the\n'Directory Of Reserach in\nBritish Universities and\nPolytechnics' which\ncontains detailed titles of\nPhD projects which have\nbeen carried out recently.\nOf course,you'll need to\ncheck whether you can get\nthe money for your studies\nand whether you need any\npre-course experience. To\nbe safe, you should think\nabout applying for PhDs\nand Master around\nChristmas but for many\nvocational courses like\nteaching, you should be\napplying now. If you think t that there's the slightest\nchance of wanting to\ncontinue your studies, then\napply. If you get an offer of\na place, you can alway turn\nit down, otherwise you may\nfind yourself having to wait\na year because you\ndecided too late.\nu "

    "content": "The National Centre for\nAlternative Technology\n(NCAT) is situated in the\nmidst of wooded hills near\nMachynlleth, mid-Wales.\nArriving there, as our party\ndid late at night, we were\nstruck first by the cold\ncleanliness of the air, the\nsilence and the millions of\nvisible stars\u2014quite a shock\nafter London\u2014but it wasn't till the following morning,\nwhen we awoke to an\nexceptionally lovely\nweather, that we realised\nquite how beautiful a place\nwe had come to.\nThe Centre itself is built\nin a disused slate quarry,\nsince its foundation ten\nyears ago many of the\nbarren slate heaps have\nbeen lovingly reclaimed by\nthe planting of trees,\nshrubs and grasses; and\nthe ruined buildings have\nbeen totally restored. The\noverall impression is one of\nfertility and harmony.\nHowever the legacy of the\nold quarry is apparent\neverywhere; the ubiquitous\nslate has been used for\nconstruction wherever\npossible; trolley tracks run\naround the site and old\ntunnels lead through the\nhills to stunning viewpoints\nwhere you can gaze at the\nvast sheer rock faces.\nThe purpose of NCAT is\nto demonstrate and develop\na way of life which depends\non working with nature\nrather man against it,\ncaring tor the environment\nrather than thoughtlessly\nharming it by needless\npollution, squandering of\nprevious resources like\nfossil fuels, mass\ndi struct ion of the world's wildlife and so on.\nAlternative technology is\nnot just about windmills\nand water pumps, but about\npeople; it is about\nachieving a healthy,\ncomfortable, satisfying\nexistence which is\nsustainable indefinitely and\nallows everyone a fair\nshare. It recognises that\npeople's needs can be met\nwith out harm to others of\nthe environment and that\nby encouraging d.i.y., community schemes and\nlocal self-reliance life could\nbe made a lot more\nenjoyable for those\ninvolved. Alternative\ntechnology is based on the\nbelief that social progress\ncan not be measured by\nthe quantity of goods\nproduced and consumed\nbut rather by the quality of\nlife, which in our society\nfrequently means\nun healthiness, alienation,\nloneliness, bewilderment\nand in the long term,\necological suicide.\nWacky\nWindmills\nJose Michaelis recently visited the National Centre for\nAlternative Technology. In this article he talks about his\nexperiences.\nThe NCAT is not just an\nexhibition space; it is a working example of the\nalternative lifestyle it\nadvocates. It is self\nsufficient in many\nrespects\u2014all electricity is\ngenerated on site by wind\nand water power; heating is\nprovided by solar power,\nheat pumps and renewable\nfuels (largely wood). The\nemphasis however on\nconservation rather than\noverproduction, so all the\nbuildings are well insulated\nand waste heat is recovered\nby heat exchanger s. The\ncentre also filters water for\nits own needs from a nearby res e voir; and\nproduces its own vegetable\nand dairy produce\norganically (ie without\nartificial chemical means).\nAll organic waste (human,\ngarden and domestic) is\nrecycled into compost and\nas far as possible things\nthat won't rot are reused!\nMost of the NCAT staff live\non site with their families\nand thus it is a true\nworking community.\nDecisions and tasks are\nshared democratically and\nstaff wages reflect the\nphilosophy that\neverybody's contribution is\nvaluable\u2014salaries are\nneeds rather than 'merit'\nbased.\nIn order to demonstrate\nthat the 'alternative' lifestyle\nis both possible and\ndesirable, the centre\nwelcomes visitors on a day\nor residential basis. The\n'visitor circuit' takes you\naround a working display\nof wind, water and solar\npower, biofuels, energy\nsaving and organic farming\nas well as exhibitions\nexplaining what alternative\ntechnology is and why it is\nnecessary. The\npresentation is such that\nthe displays are of interest\nto everyone regardless of\nage or depth of technical\nknowledge.\nAs well as the\ndisplay/exhibition, the\ncentre runs res die nti al courses on subjects as\nvarious as d.i.y. solar\npower, whole food cookery\nand practical skills\nappropriate for third world\nwork\u2014the latter course\nbeing supported by VSO\nand similar voluntary\norganisations. Although a registered charity the\nNCAT derives much of its\nincome from admission and\ncourse fees, as well as the\ndo-it-yourself\nwindmill.\nprofits from the excellent\nrestaurant and bookshop\n(where you can buy plans\nfor the d.i.y. windmills,\nsolar panels etc for a nominal price!).\nThe Centre also\nwelcomes volunteers,\nwhich is how we come to\nbe there. We spent the first\nday being shown around\nthe site and second\nengaged in a variety of\ntasks from digging\ndrainage ditches, to\nrepairing windmills and\nwater pumps. The\naccommodation was\ncomfortable and cheap and\nfood was provided though\nwe organised its\npreparation ourselves.\nEveryone worked as hard\nas they wanted to\u2014being a weekend, the pace was\nvery relaxed; during the\nweek volunteers are\nexpected to work\nreasonably hard. The\natmosphere is friendly and\nhelpful, though, any\ncontribution is appreciated.\nThe striking thing about\nthe centre is how relevant\nits work is to all of us; not\njust to those fortunate\nenough to live in the Welsh\nhills! The emphasise on\nindividual and local self-reliance make the\ntechnology accessible to\neveryone\u2014and highly\ndesirable too; for instance\ndid you know that domestic\nfuel consumption can be\nreduced by up to 80% by\ngood insulation and waste\nheat recovery? Although\nsimply materials and\nconstructions are used\nwhere possible, 'hi-tech' is\nnot avoided but utilised\nwhere appropriate\u2014for\nexample a sophisticated\nelectronic device may be\nused to control the flow\nover a solar panel made\nfrom an old radio at or. the\ntechnologies on display\nand in use at the Centre\nare eminently practical and\nvis able, from the largest\nwindmill (sophisticated\nDutch machine rated at\n15Kw) to the smallest\ncompost bin. No one at the\nNCAT appears to have\nmany illusions about their\nwork. The change towards\nalternative technology and\nway of life available to you,\nthe visitor or volunteer. A visit may inspire you to\nrethink your own career or\njust give you a few ideas\nabout running your\nhousehold but it will be\nenjoyable.

    "content": "z Trouble At\nNUS Demo\nmmA demonstrator being removed from Trafalgar Square\nPolice made 280 arrests in\nTrafalgar Square last\nSaturday when a demonstration spilled on to\nthe road in front of the\nSouth African Embassy.\nMost of the arrest were\npeaceful, but pro tes ers who\nwere unwilling to move\nalong were dealt with\nforcefully. The\nphotographs, taken by IC\nstudent Mark Harman show\na police officer removing a man from the ground by\nputting his fingers up the\nman's nose and lifting.\nThe trouble occured\nwhen students from an\nNUS rally joined a group of\ndemonstrators from the\nCity anti-apartheid society.\nMr Harman, a second year\nComputing student and\nChairman of the College\nCND society, was taking\npart in the anti-apartheid\ndemonstration. He told\nFELIX that the early stages\nof the NUS rally had\npassed off without any sign\nof trouble. He estimated\nthat about 800 students had\ngathered for the protest in\nTrafalgar Square. At\naround 3.00pm they moved\noff to deliver letters to Sir\nGeoffry Howe asking for\nsanctions against South\nAfrica. A smaller number of\nstudents returned to\nTrafalgar Square and\njoined the group of anti-a path eid demonstrators in\nfront of the Embassy. Mr\nHarman said that the police\nwere probably correct to\nbegin arresting protestors\nwho were causing an\nobstruction and refused to\nmove, but was concerned\nthat their methods were\nu necessarily rough. He\nadded the the police\nseemed too well prepared\nfor the possibility of arrests\nand not suffice ntl y organised to make sure\nthat the demonstration\npassed off peacefully.\nIn a statement to FELIX,\nNew Scotland Yard press\nofficer Martin Hobgood\ndescribed Saturdays police\noperation as 'very tolerant,\nrestrained and well-supervised'. When asked\nabout the 'fingers in the\nnose' method of removing\ndemonstrators he said that\nsince July 1982 police-officers had been taught a 'new system of arrest\ntechniques'. These are\nbased on the Japanese\naikido technique and are\nintended to make the level\nof force used controllable.\nHe added that of the 280\npeople arrested only 18\nwere being charged, and\nno injuries had been\nreported.\nAsh Wants\nMore Women\nThe number of women\nstudents at IC will double\nto one third of all students\nwithin eight years if the\ntarget set by the Rector,\nEric Ash, is met.\nAddressing the\nCommemoration Day\nceremony in the Royal\nAlbert Hall yesterday\nafternoon, the Rector called\nupon female graduates to\nspread the message that a career as a scientist or\nengineer offers an exciting\nfuture, one that is just as\nmuch for women as for\nmen. During Lord Flowers'\nRectorship the proportion\nof woman had increased\nfrom 9% to 17%, he said.\n'To obtain a comparable\nmultiplying factor I have\nuntil 1993 to increase this\nproportion to 33%.'\nAlso in his address the\nnew Rector praised the\nwork of his predecessor\nLord Flowers, saying he\ncould only hope to emulate\nhis success. The College is\ni he said, ready to meet the\nI challenge of dual-funding,\nand already derives almost\nhalf its income from non-UGC sources. This could\nbe done, he felt, without\nj ep or di sing pure science\nresearch for which there\nwas no immediately\nobvious industrial use.\nRefering to the recent\nGovernment green paper\non higher education he\nwelcomed the proposed\nincrease in students of\nscience and technology,\nbut went on to call for an\nincrease in the Science\nvote, Government money\ngiven to the Research\nCouncils.\nThe speech was a contrast to the sharply-worded attacks on\nGovernment policy\ndelivered by Lord Flowers\nat recent Commemoration\nDays. It also revealed the\nnew Rector feels he has\nsome way to go before he\nleaves the shadow of his\npredecessor and stamps his\nown authority and\npersonality on the College.\nSmall Unions\nTo Decline\nClive Jenkins, General\nSecretary of ASTMS, spoke\nto the Industrial Society on\nTuesday, predicting the\ndecline of small unions and\ntheir replacement by larger\nmulti-trade unions. He also\nforesaw training schemes\nas a perm in ent feature of\nemployment and advocated\nunion representation in\ndecision-making in\npreference to a purely\nbargaining-based system.\nSelkirk Again\nA petition signed by most\nof Selkirk and Tizard Hall\nresidents was handed to\nPeter Hallworth, Managing\nSurveyor of Residences, on\nWednesday. The petition\nwas submitted in support of\na letter to Mr Hallworth\nobjecting to the building of\nstaircase kitchens.\nAfter the Warden's SubCommittee meeting on\nWednesday, Carl Burgess,\nUnion President, said that\n'everyone is perfectly\nwilling for different plans to\nbe implemented' He added,\nwhat is good for FalmouthKeogh Hall is not\nnecessarily good for Tizard\nand Selkirk'. The matter will\nbe discussed at the\nStudents' Residence\nCommittee next\nWednesday.\nDSES Robbery\nThieves escaped with a tape deck, a number of\ninternal telephones, and\nseveral half filled jars of\ncoffee after breaking into\nthe DSES building on\nSunday afternoon.\nThe thieves climbed\nscaffolding at the rear of\nthe building and entered\nthrough a third floor\nwindow. Later that night an\nintruder evaded police and\npolice dogs by escaping\nover the roof.\nThe police have collected\nfingerprints and footprints\nand are awaiting forensic\nevidence. Window locks\nhave now been fitted to the\nbuilding.\n6 Friday 25 October FELIX\n\n"

K.B. quartet.\nThey gave a superb\nperformance. The quartet\nwere a superbly talented\nand unobtrusive\ncounterpart to Miss\nWilson's singing,\nperforming a wide range of\n40's and 50's dance tunes\nand uptempo minor\nballads. At times Miss\nWilson appeared a little\nuneasy, as if looking for a stool, but, borne up by\nStuart Curtis' liberated sax,\nthe set never once lost its\nconcentration or its vitality\nThis is no comeback for\nMiss Wilson however.\nml\nThe Caucasian Chalk\nCircle is subtitled 'a fable in\nwhich everyone gets what\nthey deserve', which is true\nenough. This amiable tale\ntells of what happens to\nrich and poor in a time of\npolitical and military\nupheaval in a fictitious but\nvaguely biblical time and\nplace. As one expects in a self respecting modern play\nthe rich are portrayed as\nunpleasant people who\nspend their time doing\nunpleasant things. Sure\nenough the particularly\nobnoxious wife of the chief\ngo verner leaves her baby\nbehind when the royal\npalace is attacked in her\nhurry to save her favourite\ndresses. The poor child,\nwho we are pleased to\nlearn has not the time to be\ntainted by wealth, is\ndiscovered by a kitchen\nmaid, and she brings it up\nand cares for it in the best\nway her meagre resources\nwill allow. This causes\nproblems when the war\nMari me. John Burgess talks to Mari Wilson\nIndeed, as she was quick to\npoint out, Mari Wilson has\nnever been away. Those\nheady days with The\nWilsations, (formerly The\nImaginations until a certain\nfunk band told them\notherwise) earned her a recording contract with the\nCompact Organisation, two\nwell placed chart successes\nand the dismal legend of\n'Miss Beehive; Queen Of\nNeasden.'\nThankfully, however,\nmuch of this is now history.\nThe beehive has gone. Her\namicable split with\nCompact Records, with\nwhom she went hand-in-hand during their early\nyears, was brought about in\norder to escape the stylish,\nthough hardly substantial\nstance that they have\nadopted. There is a possibility of a move to\nLondon records, but this\nhasn't been confirmed at\nall. Neither does there\nappear to be any hurry.\nPerhaps Mari Wilson\nhopes to find fame and\nfortune without the\ncompromise and pressure\nof success that recording\ncom paine s demand. There\nis no doubt that her\nsmooth, control lea but\nwonderfully flexible voice\noutstrips the efforts of\ntoday's chart-based pri-madonnas. She is in no\ngreat hurry for a hit, unless\nit happens by accident of\ncourse. Indeed the relaxed\natmosphere of the London\nclubs has allowed her to\nstrengthen her style and\ntechnique to a far greater\ndegree than, say, Sade and\nher previous\ncontemporaries.\nOf becoming a new blues\nlegend? Certainly there\naren't enough.

    "content": "THE AW\nAn easy guide to find the perfect employer\n'How do I choose which\nemployer to apply to ? They\nall seem much the same. I 'll\napply to the seven largest,\nmost famous employers with\nthe most vacancies and that\nwill probably do'.\nIt might work but, if you\nhave spent any time at all\nchoosing what occupation you\nwish to follow, it seems a pity\nto mess up you future\nhappiness by failing to carry\nout adequate research on your\nprospective employer.\nThere are five Directories of\nemployers of graduates,\n'Register of Graduate\nEmployment and Training'\n(RoGET); 'Graduate\nEmployment and Training'\n(GET); 'Graduate\nOpportunities' (GO); 'Directory\nof Opportunities for\nGraduates' (DOG) and,\n'Directory of Opportunites in\nNew\nTechnology'(DONT)These are\na good source for your\npreliminary list of possible\nemployers. Besides outlining\nthe vacancies that they may\nhave, they may tell you about\nthe Company's size, its\nlocation, its pattern of\nemployment and even a little\nof its ph o los oph y. Many\nemployers produce special\nGraduate brochures which\nprovide profiles of recent\ngraduate entrants of the 'Day\nin the Life of..' variety. There\nare many videos for those who\nprefer watching and listening\nto reading. These can be\nviewed in the Careers Video\nRoom, key from Sherfield\nRoom 309. Although all these\nsources will tell you\nsomething of the companies;\nthey are produced and written\nby the j m ploy ers themselves\nand therefore are unlikely to\npaint the companies n anything other than glowing\nterms. The same can be said\nof the recent graduates\nbrought along to Company\npresentations. A company is\nunlikely to bring along people\nwho think it's a foul company\nin which to work! So how can\nyou find out which company is\nfor you? Firstly, you must\nknow what you want from an\nemployer. What sort of\nenvironment would you enjoy,\nwhat promotion prospects or\ntraining would suit you best,\ndo you want a very open,\nfriendly style of management\nor would you prefer more\nconservative formal firm?\nWhat other factors are likely to\nmake the difference for you\nbetween one employer and\nanother? Then when face to\nface with employers or recent\ngraduates, you can ques it ion them closely. The Careers Fair\nis a good place to start. You\nmight ask them why they think\nyou should work for them\nrather than for X and Co\nalthough don't sound too\narrogant when doing so!\nAnother valuable way of\nfinding out about different\nemployers is at the old\nstudents' Association Careers\nevening.\nOnce you have narrowed the\nfield of employers, you can\nsave everyone an awful lot of\ntime by checking whether the\ncompanies actually have\nvacancies in the areas of\nwhich you are applying. Every\nyear, a well known computing\nCompany is inundated with\napplications for computer\nprogramming jobs. They do\nhave between 400 and 500\nvacancies but not for\ncomputer programmers.\nIf the company is visiting\nthe campus during the\nGraduate Recruitement\nPorgramme then you can\nobtain the application forms\nfor the Careers library\notherwise you will have to\napply directly to the company.\nAnd finally, think about\n'falling back positions'. Please\nconsider the wisdom of only\napplying it to the big,\nglamours, well-known\ncompanies. Every year on the\nImperial Graduate Recruitment\nProgramme, perfectly\nrespectable companies have to\ncancel their visits through lack\nof applications. Just think\nwhat it would do to your\nchances of success if you\napplied to such a company.\nApplications\nESS3\nBooks have been written on\nthis topic and so it is not\nparticularly easy to condense\ninto a couple of hundred\nwords or so. A good\napplication is absolutely\ncrucial in seeking any\njob\u2014without it, you have no\nchance of an interview, let\nalone the job! The reasons\nwhy most applications fail are\nbecause they are badly\npresented (illegible writing,\ncoffee-stains etc), ill\nthought out and poorly\nexpressed. One employer\nreported he had rejected 90%\non those grounds. Perhaps\nmore typically an employer\nwith about 15 jobs might\nreceive 700 applications and\nthese would be reduced to\nabout 150 for the first\ninterview. Thus it really is\nsignificant to get the interview.\nWhat then is the 'secret'.\nActually there is no secret at\nall; just plain common sense.\nSo here then are a few tips.\n1 Think carefully about what\nkind of job you want, indent if y possible employers then read\nup about them and their\nvacancies.\n2 Follow the instructions on\nthe form carefully. If they say\n'attach a photograph and write\nin black ink' then you cannot\nexpect too much if you do not\nsend a photograph and write\nin blue ink (as a depressing\nnumber of applicants did for\none employer last year).\n3 Work out in advance your\nanswers to the questions on\nthe form.\n4 Draft and edit your answers\nto fit the spaces provided.\n5Answer all the questions. If\none is not really applicable to\nyou, explain why that is so\nand do not leave the space\nblank.\n6Keep it all simple; keep a copy.\n7 Try and view your\napplication from the\nemployers point. Would you\nbe impressed by the answers?\nIt is not likely that you would\nbe if there were broad\nunsupported genera list ions eg\n'I can communicate well and\nget on with people'\u2014is the\nevidence elsewhere on our\nform?\n8If you want more help/advice\nsee one of the Careers\nAdvisers. If also after a few\napplications you haven't been\ninvited to an interview, come\nand see us again.\nZ7\nInternet\nThe Unspoken\nMessages'\u2014When called to\ninterview the unspoken\nmessage from the employer is\nthat they like the look of you\non paper and so wish to meet\nyou to confirm that view. The\ninvitation to the second\ninterview is that having\nchecked you out, 'we'd now\nlike to give you the proper\ninterview from which we may\nmake you an offer'.\nThus the first interview, often\nheld in College and certainly\nfor those employers listed in\nthe GRP programme, is\nrelatively short. Much will\nconsist of points in your\napplication\u2014'Tell me more\nabout that', 'Why did you do\nthat', 'describe your project'.\nIn some cases there may be a little technical content, The\ninter iv ew is also a chance for\nyou to ask questions\u2014so have\nsome prepared! In fact be\nprepared all round\u2014dress\nsuitably, arrive in good time,\nbe friendly and positive, look\nat your interviewer, be\nprepared to smile, be\nhonest\u2014if you don't know the\nanswer to a question, say so\nand don't waffle!\nThe second interview is\nnormally on the employers\npremises. This gives a special\nchance for you to evaluate the\nemployer (after all it is a two\nway process)\u2014 does the place\nseem a good one in which to\nwork, are the employers\nfriendly, how are recent\ngraduates getting on etc. The\nemployers may have a variety\nof tests for you to do\u2014some\nuse psycho metric tests, some\nuse Group Discussions\u2014 here\nthe important thing is not so\nmuch whether you get the\nright answers to the problem\nbut how you deal with other\npeople, how do you react\nunder stress. Finally there will\nbe the interview itself, very\noften before a board. Of\ncourse you will be nervous but\nthe confidence that comes\nfrom a good preparation can\nhelp a lot.\nOnce again the Careers\nService can be part of that\npreparation. We are easy to\nfind, easy to consult and we\nare running a comprehensive\nprogramme of talks and\nseminars; we also have much\nliterature. So if you want any\nhelp, do come and see us.\n4\nSome filings To\nRememtmr\n1) General Employment\nProspects Since the low in\n1981/82, employment\nprospects have been rising\nsteadily. Although full\nUnemployment Rates are one\nobvious indicator of this (and\nImperial is always at or near\nthe bottom of that league\ntable), every other measure\ntells the same story. Thus\nthere are more jobs on offer,\nmore employers asking to\nvisit, more employers having\njobs available at Summer Fairs\nand many others. While all\nthese signs are particularly\nevident here, the same\nop tim is it ic reports are being\nmade all around the country.\nAs might be expected,\ndemand is strongest in such\nareas as electronics and\ncomputer science. One\nemployer, commenting on the\ntrend reckoned they would\nhave to run hard to stand still!\nIn other words they were\ngoing to find it much harder to\nrecruit as many graduates in\n1986 as they did in 1985.\nThere has also been a good\nrecovery in recruitment levels\nin manufacturing and, to a slightly less extent, the oil\nindustry. Finance (Banking,\nAccountancy, Insurance,\nCommodities) and Retailing\nare two other areas that need\na special mention. Most of the\nemployers here are making\nspecial efforts to attract\nscience and engineering\ngraduates.\nAll this does NOT mean that\nthe 1986 graduates can sit\nback and wait for attractive\njob offers. The market does\nnot operate that way! As an\nexample, about 300\nElectronics graduates were\nunemployed at the start of the\nyear. It is still vital to\nremember you must be\nreal is ic \u2014if you have taken five\nyears for a pass Degree do not\nin s is it on looking for aR&D Job as one graduate (From\nelsewhere in London) did a few years ago. Also good\napplications are crucial but\nthey are dealt with elsewhere\nin this issue.\n2) Taking a Year Off \u2014or six\nmonths (eg some employers\nrecruit in March). A year off\ntaken before University is\nwelcomed almost universally.\nQuite a number think seriously\ninstead about having some\ntime off after graduation and\nbefore starting (serious!) work.\nThis too can be a very\nrewarding and productive\nexperience. As usual however,\nthere are some qualifications\nto be made, If for example,\nyou are aged about 21 or 22\nthen there is no problem, from\nan age consideration,\nregarding your eventual career\nprospects. If, however, you are\n24 or 25 it may be less\nstraightforward and it could be\nworthwhile to seek careers\nadvice first. It is also good that\nat any age you would have\nsome sort of plan for the year\nand one which you can\narticulate\u2014perhaps to a future\nemployer. You should be able\nto talk about what your aims\nwere, what you gained from\nthe experience etc. You\nshould also think ahead. For\nexample it might be fun going\njacka roo ing in Australia for 12\nmonths but you will hardly be\nwell placed to apply for jobs\nback in the UK. For just such\nsimple reasons as this, 12\nmonths off have often become\n15 or more. Remember the\nvacancy lists in September are\nprobably shorter than at\nanother time of the year.\nNevertheless, given some\nthought and planning,some\ntime off after graduation can\nbe fun, productive and for\nmany, a time of great personal\ndevelopment.\nvaluable. Here in London\ntemporary work is not hard to\nfind. I can cover many\npossibilities from part-time in\na bar or as evening crew in a MacDonanlds to c halle ning administrative jobs. Job\nCentres can be a good source\nof such work and there are\nspecialist agencies. Catch 22\nis one such firm. (It's harder to\nget a job without experience\nand you can't get experience\nwithout a job). Although the\nwork might well be far\nremoved from your ultimate\nambition, it does give valuable\ninsights both into people and\nthe nature of work. It can also\nbe a useful way of funding\nthat year off.\n4) Additional Skills Another\nreason for some time off after\ngraduation and the necessity\nfor temporary work, could be\nthe raising of finance to be\nused in acquiring certain\nspecialist skills. These could\nrange from passing your\ndriving test (it's hard to get a job in Sales without a licence)\nto secretarial, computer or\nlanguage skills. When\nemployment was particular y difficult a few years ago, it\nwas quite common to find\ngraduates making such moves.\nNow the market is moving\nsteadily in the graduates\nfavour, it is perhaps less\ncommon but nevertheless it\ncan be as useful and in many\ncases as essential way to enter\ncertain areas.\n5) Summer Fairs It has always\nbeen wrong to think of\nrecruitment as being only a January to March\nphenomenon associated with\nthe Graduate Recruitment\nProgramme, other wise known\nas the Milk Round. In fact\nrecruitment this is increasingly\nbecoming an all-the-year\nround event. Nevertheless\noutside the GRP the next busy\npeak is during the Summer\nFairs. This is the time in June\nand July, starting immediately\nafter finals, when there are\nabout 10 Fairs throughout the\ncountry. Of these, London's is\nby far the biggest. This year,\nalmost 200 employers\nattended during its 3 days,\nwith a wide variety of jobs on\noffer. Thus these events are\nparticularly useful for those\nwho have not wanted to think\nabout jobs prior to graduation.\nGroup Treasury\nthe\nTrading\n\\ and\nMoney Market\nDivision of the\n3) Temporary Work While the\ngreat majority of graduates\nwant permanent work, each\nyear there are a number who\nfor a variety of reasons, seek\ntemporary work. In thinking of\nlonger term career prospects,\nvirtually all pre vous work\nexperience is useful, even V Midland Bank\nGroup\nCareer opportunities exist in\nforeign exchange dealing\ntreasury management and computing.\nTo give you an insight\ninto our business\nwe invite you\nto a careers presentation on\nWednesday 6th November\nin\nRoom 328 Sherfield Building\nat 6.00 pm.\nAll Imperial students are welcome.\nSuffolk House, 5 Laurence Pountney Hill, London EC4R0 BU.016239393 Ext, 4520,\n\n"

The Fremantle Hotel on Thursday morning\nRain Stopped\nPlay\nThe Phantom Soaker\nrefered to in last week's FELIX letters page has\nstruck once more. Three\nplastic bags containing\nwater were tipped over\nvictims as they were seated\nin the gents toilets in the\nPhysics department on\nTuesday.\nSimilar attacks have been\noccur ing since mid-September. Thirty incidents\nhave been reported to date.\nThe 'Phantom' has\nconcentrated his efforts in\nthe Sherfield building, but\nhas also visited the Physics\nand Mechanical\nEngineering departments.\nA letter, signed by The\nPhantom Soaker' has been\nmysteriously delivered to\nthe FELIX office:\nDear Editor,\nIn reply to Dr R Benodekars letter\npublished in the 18th October issue the carrier-bag in ques it ion was not\nfull of water as described\nbut about half-full of water.\nThis kind of misleading\ninformation from so called\nacademics' should justly\nbe rewarded with a soaking\nand any other Imperial\npersons who are regarded\nby myself as 'snobby nosed\nswot s' will be duly\nshowered.\nYours sincerely,\nThe Phantom Soaker\n'The Phantom has got to\nbe some kind of nut' said\nJohn Boroughs of Security.\nGeoff Reeves, Chief\nSecurity Officer, has\nexpressed concern for the\nPhantom's health and is\nappealing for any relevant\ninformation.\nThe Phantom Soaker.\nKawasaki\nSlams\nPorsche\nA motor bike was pursued\nthrough the College\ngrounds in a James Bond\nstyle chase last Friday. The\nbike, closely followed by a police van, hit a speed\nramp and jumped twenty\nfive feet before hitting a parked Porsche. The rider\nthen climbed off his\ncrumpled Kawasaki and\nmade his escape. He was\nlater apprehended behind\nthe chemistry department.\nA small amount of\ndamage was done to the\nunderside of the Porsche,\nowned by Dr Wakeman of\nChemistry, but the\nmotorbike was written off.\nPolice have declined to\ncomment on the incident.\nThe chase occured whilst\na student was being carried\naway from the Life\nSciences dinner by\nambulance men. Mr\nHaldane Broby, who had\nbeen drinking whilst on a course of antibiotics,\ncollapsed at the dinner and\nwas taken to St Stephens\nhospital. He later regained\nconsciousness and\ndischarged himself. He has\nnow recovered.\nBars\nTakeover\nIC Union will begin a phased takeover of the\nUnion bar on 1st January\n1986, if proposals put\nforward by College\nSecretary John Smith are\napproved. Mr Smith has\nprepared a first draft of a paper to be submitted\njointly with Union President\nCarl Burgess at the next\nmeeting of House\nCommittee on November 6.\nIf the plans go ahead, the\nUnion will assume full\ncontrol of the bar on 1st August 1986. The draft\nmakes no mention of\nwhether control of other\nUnion rooms will be\nincluded in negotiations for\na takeover.\nTo gain control of the\nbars the Union must first\nobtain a corporate legal\nidentity in order to apply\nfor a liquor licence. There\nwill be an inaugural\nmeeting of the Union\nPlanning Group next\nThursday at 6.15pm in the\nSCR to discuss the bar\ntakeover and the future of\nthe Union Building as a whole. Anyone interested is\nwelcome to attend. The\nUnion's response to Mr\nSmith's initial proposals,\nand the control of Union\nrooms not within the\nbuilding will also be\ndiscussed.\nASTMS\nProtest\nMr John Fecamp, branch\nsecretary of ASTMS, is\nwriting to College\nSecretary John Smith to\nask if College facilities will\nbe used by staff or students\nworking on the Star Wars\nproject. His concern\nfollows the disclosure that\nProfessor Manny Lehman\nhas signed a contract to\nwork on the project as\nreported in FELIX last\nweek.\nMr Fecamp feels that\nmany members of IC may\nobject to any such use of\nCollege facilities. The Star\nWars project, he believes, is\nmorally wrong and\ninvolvement in it would be\ndamaging to the college's image. Mr Fecamp is\nprepared to take the matter\nto the board of govern ers or the College ethics\nCommittee.\n4 Friday 25 October FELIX\n\n"

Students\ncome from all over the\nworld to be taught by some\nof the leading academics\nwho are staff here. When\nthey come here, though,\nthey have to go through\nincomprehensible and\nboring lectures delivered by\nstaff who wish they were\nresearching rather than\nteaching students. Not all\nstaff are to blame. Some\nmake great efforts to\nensure their lectures are\ninteresting. The majority\ndon't. The Union, the\nRector and many other\nnotables have recognised\nthe low teaching standards\nin many departments. They\nhave set up promotion\nsystems designed to\nencourage staff to improve\ntheir teaching.\nUnfortunately this has\nfailed to improve teaching\nat IC. The reason for this is\nquite simple. Many elderly,\nsenior academics don't accept the need for\nchange. One Head of\nDepartment refuses to\nanswer questions on his\ncourse. How can he expect\nhis staff to worry about\ntheir lecturing when he\nobviously doesn't? Members of staff as senior\nas Head of Deparments\ncan't be sacked. They can\nbe replaced, though, when\ntheir contracts come to an\nend.\nThe Head of Department\nshould be someone with a proven interest in student\nteaching. College should\nconsider attracting\nyounger,more dynamic\nHeads of Department so\nthat College develop a reputation for being\ninterested in students.\nSelf Defence\nWomen interested in\ngoing on a self defence\ncourse should contact\nKathy in the IC Union\nOffice.\nSurvey\nMany of you will have\nreceived a piece of paper\nentitled 'Men and Women:\nThe Survey'.

    "content": "This week your very own\nvicious rumours column\nturns its attention toward\nUnion personalities. Vice\nPresidents are always good\nfor a few vices and Mines\nVP Chris Griffin is no\nexception. It is a Union rule\nthat Union premises are\nonly to be used for intimate\nactivities if they are\n'discreet and unavoidable'.\nMr Griffin evidently felt no\ndiscretion was possible\nwhen seen in Kensington\nGardens one evening\nrecently. Unless the usual\nbribes are forthcoming, it\nmay be revealed exactly\nwhat injury he sustained\nfrom the tarmac. Guilds VP\nSymon Corns has been\nmaking it very very publicly\nknown that he doesn't have\nMr Griffin's problems. After\nseveral of the recent\nGuilds' buffets he and Hon\nSec Dave Page were seen\nengaging in loud and\ndrunken acts of public\nlechery. Meanwhile, Guilds'\nPresident Roger Preece is\nrumoured to have been far\nmore successful with the\ndashing officer approach,\nand has been seen 'putting\na resident of Selkirk to\nbed'.\nMeanwhile, hapless IC\nDP Dave Kingston was\nseen using a Union minibus\nto drive a young lady down\nto Eastbourne in order to\nget a dress in which to\naccompany him to the\nCommemoration Day Ball.\nUnfortunately this has also\njilted a large number of\nRCS officers who believed\nthey had enraptured the\nvery same fresher.\nFinally, more 'Northey\nBalls', it is rumoured that\ndue to problems with\nmetric and Imperial\nmeasurements the entrance\nto Mr Northey's new SCR\nbar has been made too\nnarrow for bar manager\nAlan Larson to get through.\nWe are now waiting for Mr\nNorthey's overdue run of\ngood luck.\nAnd for a dig at the\ncompetition, the C CU papers seem to be having\ntheir problems. Broadsheet\nis currently late due to the\na bsc en ce of editor Tony\nSpencer. Following a young lady home to Evelyn\nGardens and them having\nto walk back un-rewarded\nto Shepherds Bush has\napparently left him\ntemporarily unable to walk.\nPestilence\nFELIX Science Editor, Debbie Wilkes,\nlooks at new methods of insect control\nand examines research being done at IC.\nThe damage that insect\npests cause to crops is a major problem in many\nareas of the world,\nparticularly tropical and\nsubtropical regions. As\nthese pests become\nincreasingly resistant to\nconventional insecticides,\nand the pressure to protect\nthe environment in more\nacceptable ways grows, it\nis clear that there is a need\nto develop new methods of\ninsect control.\nSome plants have\nevolved elaborate chemical\ndefence mechanisms to\ncombat insect attack. In\nmany cases these natural\ndefences are far superior to\nthe man-made insecticides\nthat have been used over\nthe last few decades.\nProfessor Steve Ley, of the\nChemistry Department, is\nnaturally studying a number of these occur ing substances, derived from\nvarious plant sources,\nwhich actually inhibit\ninsects' feeding processes.\nThese compounds, known\nas anti feed ants, have\nenormous potential since\nthey have very low\nmammalian to xi cities and\ncan be selective for\nparticular insect pest\nspecies. This selectivity is\nof great value as it will\na ii ow them to be used in an\narea without unduly\ndisrupting the local\necology. It is hoped that\nthe study of these\nchemicals may provide\nvaluable information\nconcerning o io logical mechanisms involved, and\ncould ultimately lead to the\ndevelopment of\ncommercially useful insect\nanti feed ants. Many of the structures of\nthese complex natural\ncompounds are already\nknown but it is only\nrecently that people have\nbegun studying their total\nsyntheses. Professor Ley's group have had great\nsuccess in developing\ngeneral synthetic routes to\na number of anti feed ants. These rc:;tes have been\nused to produce simpler\nstructural analogues, which\nenable the relationship\nbetween biological activity\nand mole cu sti jc ture to\nbe investigate o. Recently, the group have\nhad a major breakthrough\nin their work with a particularly potent\ncompound called\nazadi r acht in. The Neem tree\n(Azadirachta Indica), which\nis native to Africa and\nIndia, has long been known\nMf OH TigO / V rv f!Af Me / ; VH r Me OX om H AZADIRACHTIN\nfor being virtually free of\ninsects, nematodes and\nother diseases. Although all\nparts of the tree seem to be\nresistant, extracts from the\nseed are particularly\npowerful, and are highly\neffective against a wide\nrange of crop pests. The\nmost important active\nconstituent, known as\nazadi r acht in, affects at least\nforty species, many of\nwhich are difficult to\ncontrol by conventional\nmethods.\nIn most cases insects\ndevelop through e cays is, which consists of a series\nof moults. It is believed that\nazadi r acht in works by\ninterfering with two\nhormones involved in this\nprocess; the ec dys one( moulting) hormone and\nthe juvenile hormone.\nAzadirachtin convinces the\ninsect it is approaching its\nmoulting phase, a time\nduring which it loses its\nappetite for food. However,\nit never goes into the full\nmoulting phase and\nconsequently dies of\nstarvation, or is eaten by\nanother predatory species,\nsuch as birds. Another\npossible commercial outlet\nfor azadi r acht in is in the\nAustralian sheep industry,\nwhere blow flies cause\ndamage estimated to be\nover 120 million dollars a year. Recent tests have\nshown that the blow flies will not lay their eggs in\nazadi r acht in imp regan a tec wool. With the American\ngovernment having recently\napproved the use of Neem\ntree extracts for pest\ncontrol, the future looks\nvery promising.\nProfessor Ley is working\nin conjunction with Rohm\nand Haas, from the USA\nand has been looking at\npossible synthetic routes to\nazadi r acht in and structural\nfragments. Their work has\nalso led them to re-examine\nthe accepted structure,\nwhich was proposed some\nten years ago. The groups\nwork, which has involved\nmainly X Ray\ncrystallographic and\nspectroscopic studies, has\nled to an unambiguous new\nstructural assignment for\nazadi r acht in. This discovery\nat Imperial College has\nenormous repercussions\nfor those companies\ndesigning novel structural\nanalogues of azadi r acht in. Increasing our\nunderstanding of how these\nnatural defences work\nforms an essential part of\nthe search for more\neffective and ecologically\nacceptable methods of pest\ncontrol.\n2\nFELIX Friday 25 October\n\n"
