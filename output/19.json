You will be interested to learn that at L.S.E., in addition to two rooms for dancing, there are -now then, girls, don't make a rush for the door three others suitably un lit. I suggest that the\n(appropriate) authorities consider the provision of similar facilities here; suitable action would\nalso help relieve the present congestion upstairs. This matter is urgent, since the Albert Hall will not be available until after the Festival of Bri tain (see last FELIX), by which time she will be no\nlonger in London.\nThis is, of course, just another of those problems which would be solved at once were hostel ac como dati on available for all of us.\nYours etc., In former, R.C.S. P.S.:I notice that it will soon be most inconvenient to attempt to use Kensington Gardens at night. This makes the above EVEN MORE urgent. TAPE RECORDER\nSir Mr. de Reuck had suggested no doubt with malicious intent that ordinary course lectures should be recorded and played back to their perpetrators. He antic a pates\" salutary\" effects,and.\nno doubt privately hopes forfar worse. He will be disappointed to learn that one of the very reasons for purchasing the tape recorder was to do just as he suggests. Several lecturers have submitted themselves to examination by\nrecorder and have been delighted with the results. It is, of course, out of the question to offer the facilities of the recordings to students, as it is certain that, if these were available, students would pay even less attention to the lectures than they do at present. Your set c.,K. D Tocher, E.H. Lloyd.\nMathematics Department, 2.3.51-'CULTURE IN I.C.' Sir Everything has to be learned, from making\nlove to making money. Left to ourselves we do\nnothing} this applies to' cx il ture' which is an acquired taste generally speaking, our first interest is generated by contact with someone who is ent hus i a stic about this play or that picture; curiosity compels us to discover the source of his heat; if only to make conversation with him.\nThis is why any opportunity for closer con tact between I.C and R.C.A. and R.C.M. is valuable. As \" is well known, for many years I.C. has taken in its human material, filed it, abraded it, re moved its burrs in order to manufacture a gadget\nthat fits with little fuss into the industrial mac h in e. Every year the monopoly capitalist spur chase the most accurately machined of these. Picture to yourself one of those gadgets as it ticks its life away - the monotony relieved perhaps by at it tilia tion of the senses here, a tingling there, or with luck fc ya few wars and revolutions.^ Recently, however, a sensitive plant has rai sed its tentative head in the steel I mean all the activities derided by D. G.R.in his in famous letter. How easy for this oaf to trample on and destroy this flower!< I picture him low-browed, broad bottomed, a swede in one hand, a hunk of boiled hac on in the\nother, he gnaws, Bestial!) Let Imperial College in form D. G.E. that it must Express its Soul come what may.\nMay I suggest, Sir, that D. G.R. be metaphorically spat upon from a great height? B.E. Mc.\nOur contributor replies: Sir - B.E. Mo. is looking at I.C. through pink oo lou red spectacles. Hasn't it occurred to him\nthat some students in I.C. might be heartily sick of having this ersatz culture thru3 t before them?\nIt the average student in 1.0. doesn't want to be\nliberally e duo a ted( and believe me, he doesn't), why not leave him in the darkness? He won't cry.\nD. G.R. The Editor regrets that owing to a lack\nof space a number of Readers' letters have had to v be omitted.\nBLUE FOR A BOY\nSir It was with perplexity that I observed the\ntender roseate hue of my last copy of FELIX. I had always thought that FELIX was a little boy -surely I am not mistaken?\nNor can I think that (s) he could have any\ncause to blush; and - whisper it no sinister trend to the Left could be intended.\nNo, I have it! It was a delicate compliment\nto I. C.W. A. Dear Mr. Editor how sweet of you!\nYours in aflutter, Iewarian,\nmm f%f lit J cH08 te1'2825i 'NOT ON YOU R.H Ffc l\" RADIO SOCIETY\nBISHOP AT ANNUAL DINNER The presidential address of the society was del ive red by'H. Bishop, C.B.E., F. C.G.I., on the sub-j ect of \"Broadcast Engineering\" to a packed house\non Monday, Feb. 19th. Introducing the president, the chairman mentioned that Mr. Bishop had started his career by studying in the Guilds' Department of\nMechanical Engineering and Motive Power and had been\nChief Engineer of the B.B.C. \"since 1943.\nIn the course of his most interesting address\nMr. Bishop discussed the problems encountered at the various stages of broadcasting. These ranged\nfrom the acoustical properties of studios to the\nrelative merits of disc versus magnetic tape recording; from the interference between the four hundred\nEuropean stations sharing thirty nine transmitting channels to the lining up of volume, programme to\nprogramme. We learnt that of the new television transmitters planned some\nof these would be of low\npower with horizontal polarisation necessitating a horizontal dipole, this it was hoped would be more\naesthetically pleasing. A number of slides illustrating the address\nbrought the meeting to a close whence it retired to the Union.\nSherry followed by a first rate dinner created an excellent after dinner atmosphere. Of the many able and ii.itty speeches one\nrecalls in particular: the Hon. Secretary' s con-clu sion that the success of the U.S.A. was due to\ntheir constitution, institution, and pros...perity; J. A. Fredericks,\" honour the academic staff that thy\ndays may be long;\" Prof. Will is Jackson,\"the best\nway of Saving a family is to become a lecturer.\" Prof. Jackson concluded his speech with a short a pre cia tion of As st.

    "content": "FELIX\nI kl IF ft If SPORT ROWING\nREADING ROUTED On Saturday, February 2 4 th., the first four I.O. B.C. crews beat their opposite number of Heading University at Heading.\nOn a flood stream, the1 st. and 2nd. Eights rowed upstream from the top of the island below\nthe H.U.B. O. boat house to the bend below the Hegatta start, whilst the3 rd. and 4 t h.Eights rowed downstream over the same distance. The 1 st. Eight had the stiffest opposition to fao e. Their rao e was in two distinct phases.\nHeading had decided to row flat out for the first half, in an attempt to break the heart of the I.C. crew, which was at a very marked d is adv ant age in the matter of stations. Heading going ahead at the start had an unsettling eff eot on\n1.0. and a rush developed in an effort to draw\nlevel. As a result, they were 1 l/2 lengths down at the half distance. At this point, the efforts of coach and cox began to tell and the crew began to row with time and rhythm. From\nhere to the finish they were a different crew\nand, rowing very well indeed, passed Heading to win by 1/3 of a length in8 min. 54 sec. This crew, with such a fighting spirit, i3 potentially a very fast one if it will allow itself the time, in the right places, to apply it's full power.\nThe 2nd. Eight made no mistake. Going\nof fat37 and yet being1/2 a length down at the end of the first minute did not worry them..\nOn the better station, they settled down to row\nthrough their opponents by letting the boat run between the strokes and giving themselves time\nto prepare for and take a true and solid next\nstroke. At the end of the second minute they\nwere 1 length ahead and dropping their rating,( at one point as low as 2 4 ) , they had a comfortable row, working it up to36 at the finish, to win easily in6 min. 59 seo. The 3 rd. Eight too had a comfortable row,\nthough somewhat more rugged than the2 nd.. Eight. Their parti ou lar characteristic as a crew is a wholehearted attack on the beginning, wh i oh was\nvery much in evidence as they whipped the rating up at the finish of the race,, The\nresult was easily and the time 5 min. 10 seo. The 4 th. Eight rowed a well judged rao e, and though barely ao an vas ahead at the Regatta finish, stroke timed his final spurt to a nicety and well backed up by the rest of the crew, won\nby 1 1/2 lengths in5 min. 24 sec. DRUNK AGAIN !\nOf the celebrations afterwards little need\nbe said, except to say that it did your correspondent's heart good to see the Boat Club\nbehaving with a spirit and verve that it has not displayed for some years. This is no time for complacency but let us hope that this may prove\nto be the beginning of a very successful year's rowing. SAILING\nOXFORD UNIVERSITY S.C18I. C. S.C.2I# In very good sailing weather I.C beat Oxford University after a well fought match. On as w ol len river and a fast current I.C. helmsmen did a won-de rful job, coming close first s in both races, with the others bunched so that there was little between\nthem.\n1.0. is still on top in the University points racing and with only a few weeks to go it seems that they have every chance of winning the cup. The club welcomes the recent change in its constitution which makes it an Athletic Club, for there is little doubt\nthat sailing is a sport in every sense of the word.\nSummer plans include entries to the Rickmansw or th Team Trophy, the Morton Stevenson Trophy, theN in a Wood Trophy, and the RaN.V.R. Challenge Trophy.\nIt is also hoped to take boats to Hay ling Island for a week's sailing holiday at the end of the summer\nterm.\nBOXING\nVICTORY FOR MINES After the preliminary bouts on Friday23 rd Feb.,\nthe semifinals and finals were held in the gymnasium on Thursday, 1 st March. A pugilistic evening opened with the match where in W. Gardner (R.S. M.) earned the pot for the winner of the best fight. His opponent M. Hull (C&G) shares the credit for this 'ring-warmer' which set the pace for the comp et it ions. Next 'Gabby' Gales'( R.C. S.)ex peri en ce overcame G. Evans' \\ R.S. M.) pluck, the fight being stopped in the second round. A pas de deux\nensued with Terry Hulme (R.S. M.) and R. Carol in( RCS) the tatter's pirouettes failing to score the points. The middleweight final saw P. Huckin (R. S.M.)a very fine boxer score a technical K.O. over a very game Tony Greenfield( R. SjM.). Stan Copnelman\n(R.C.S.), punctuating his blows with adjustments to his coiffure, K.O'd Bill Cook (C&.G) after a hectic, evenly matched session. After the interval, the cruiserweight final saw P. Ebsworth's(R. S.M.) orthodoxy just out pointing the damaging windmilling of K. Brookman (R.C.S.). Perhaps the bloodiest fight of the evening was that where in the cool Andrew F abel( R.S. M.) beat P. Harding( R.C.S.) on points. There is no need to enlarge upon the latter' s courage. David O torr s's(R. S.M.) heavyweight onslaught paid quick dividends, John B otter ill( C&G) getting little opportunity to display his boxing skill, the fight being stop ped in round one. In his second fight of the even-ing the plucky Gardner lost on a technical K.0 to Mike Humphreys (R. S.M.).A quickstep fight fol lowed ( s, q,q, s,) in which \"Gabby\" Gales( R.C.S.) out pointed Anton Brown (R.S. M.). Holy Reynolds( R.CS.) hung on for two rounds against\" Killer\" Hulme (R.S M.), the fight being stopped in the third. Squat Stan Coppelham ( still qui ff flip p ing) K.O'd lanky Ted Bell( R.S. M.)ina fight which\nthoroughly aroused partisan feeling in the audience. A very fine conclusion to a fine evening's sport. The Rector presented the Inter College Boxing Cup to\" Killer\" Hulme, the captain of the winning team, the Mines Jbsaving gained18 points to R.C.S' s28 and Guilds'10. Sir Rod eric Hill also pre sen ted the best winner' spot toW. Gardner (R. S.M.).It is hoped that I.C. will provide plenty of vocal support for their boxers in the U.L. Inter College Championshipswhich are to be held atL. S.E.at7 pm\non March 1 6 th. M. F.M. RUG G ERI,C.3 Royal Vet. Coll.10i io os vii og j of ltft lT SfrrTr&eij l \u00bbv ad oJ bie e ed v lb Waterlogged grounds had caused the cancellation of matches in the previous three weeks, but on\nFeb. 2 4 th I.C. were able to play R.V. C. for the third time this season. (Twice before in the U.L. cup\nscores being33 and 0-3). On this occasion I.C. were not at full strength and were defeated by the clear margin of two goals to a penalty goal(103). Forward the sides were evenly matched but behind the scrum the Vets combined better and were more\nthrust ful and dangerous.\nCongratulations to Bill Robinson on his election to the captaincy of U.L. Rugger. This is the second successive year that the club has had an\nI.C. Captain. ATHLETICS The first of the inter college contests has already been held( The Tug), and the Three Miles is to be decided on Wednesday, 1 4 th March at Padding ton. This date is also that of the Fresher s' Trials, when it will be seen how the new blood comp-are s with the old; rumour has it that dark horses are prevalent. It is hoped that the College Captains will use\nthe Fresher s' Trials to seed their athletes for the Annual Sports, and that encouragement will be forthcoming from their armchair supporters and critics, as well as the little bands of would-be world beaters from R.C.S., Guilds and\nR.S.

    "content": "FELIX\nOPERA IN ITALY/ An amusing and vivid talk on 'Opera in Italy'( a joint R.C. A.R.C. M.I.C. meeting) was given by\nMr. L. Roth, \"of our Maths. Dept. , on Monday 2 6 th Feb.. in the Botany Lecture Theatre. This was crowded with90 people, but this atmosphere suited the talk. The chairman was Mr. David Hall, President of R. C.K. Students' Association, himself a student of singing: some 20 R.C.M. students came in support. Although there were in fact no illustrations, Mr. Roth made his impressions live and made many\nsharp points with Sh avian strategy and tactics. Mozart was the ideal, Puccini and Verdi the great approaches to it, Berlioz the fantastic} Wagner\nwas out of context, Masoagni atrocious Rosenkavalier' was condemned as \" this extraordinary post'. Vagnerian contraption and outdated monster, crushed under its own weight.\" Realism was defined as\n\" large as life and twice as natural\". Mr. Roth showed that in Italy opera is a national necessity. It is subsidized as naturally as any public service, and every performance is a special event - though every Italian knows the mus-ic, and often the words too, of all the operas, from childhood. Cn the question of translation, he insisted that the original should be used, because of the overall co design of the music. It was agreed\nthat a great decline in singing has been going on\nfor2030 years although orchestras and production were as good as ever. An English tradition he cons ide red impossible until opera houses were as num-ero us as in Italy; the present necessity of having samples of the German, Italian and French traditions was thought to be a good thing, and should be exp an ded.\nPeter Haskell( R.C.S. President), before proposing a vote of thanks, gave a view of opera available to the army in Italy during the war: the meet-ing finished with refreshments in' the I. C.W. A.

The production as a whole was rather ad is app ointment*'and, in particular, the costumes could hardly be said to have justified the adjective' colourful' which the producer had applied to them in the programme. Nevertheless, the lighting was superb\nthe whole time and the settings, though a little realistic for a fantasy like 'The Tempest', were\nquite pleasant to look at. The masque in the fourth act was an excellent piece of stage craft. So much for the staging; the acting generally was adequate. June Sweeney as Ariel, Brian All sd ridge as Prospero, Christopher Alexander as Trinculo and David Bates as Caliban were outstanding, particularly the last named. Richard Fowler seemed\nto be miscast as Alonso while Robert Ellis did. not\ndo himself justice as Stephano. The singing of Sheila M. Salt was delightful, but the offstage flute was certainly not heavenly, although at times it sounded like nothing on earth.

Peter Hayward was no exception, and fired by\nthe example cfa distinguished uncle in the Royal Navy, decided to join the Fleet Air Arm.\nIn 1942 he went to Trinidad for a year's course on navigation, followed by'a\" knife and fork\" course at' Greenwich, where he learnt to be an\nofficer. t, cb Lie sw e6a. From then until Dday he had an interesting time with a\" Firefly\" Fighter Squadron, doing such varied jobs as anti submarine work and\nspotting for H.M.S. Rodney, liberally l.s ced with shore based training. This variety continued during the D day period when reconnaissance work\nand the shooting up of ground targets wai a^ cle a to the list. He was then posted to the East Indies and\nflew \"from'H.M.S. Avenger. Up to this tine he had\nbeen extremely lucky with pilots, but after\" hitting the island\"(\" p ranging the bridge\") a couple of times, he began to wonder whether the luck hadn't changed. As a result he gave vent tch is feelings in no uncertain manner, and is still not sure whether he fixed the squadron, or the squadron fixed him!\nHowever, the posting was a good one, and\nbrought a training spell in Sydney, and promotion to Lieutenant. Then followed a spell of fighter interception in the Formosa are q, end finally night fighter training a dicey business. Peter came t otheR.S. M.in October 1946,\nstarting on the Oil course. His presence was\nimmediately' felt', when it was discovered he was\nthe brains behind the de-bagging of Peter Harding President of the R.S. M.( This story is not intended tc give ideas to enterprising fresher sl) In 1947 he rowed for the I.C. VIII in the \"Head\nof the River\" races, and was in the Morphy winning Mines VIII. He was elected president oaT J.C. for l94S9, bata difference of opinion with the Board of Examiners\nforced him to relinquish this job, and to change from\n' Oil' to' Mining'. One of his main job sasR. S.M. President this year has been done on the Committee preparing for the R.S. M. Centenary next Autumn. Despite this he\nstill finds time to support the odd carnival and play rug ger when the wheat her permits. Peter plans to leave the sheltered and cloister like hostel for the Rand this summer, and in words\nwhich he has used to many a fellow sufferer before an exam:- \"And the best of luck to you, too11.

P.O 'Brien,RCS..Chairman.Appeal Committee.\nTHE I CW ARIANS \"The Institute for the Comfort of Women in Adversity\" was a recent interpretation by the Rector of the letters I. C.W. A. The occasion was the I. C.W. A. Annual Dinner a fortnight ago, and the Rector was proposing the toast of the Association. He referred to the first known case of \"Adomic\nSplitting\", one of the more dangerous isotopes produced being the femme fatale._<; In a witty response June Mahon, President of the Association, intrigued her audience by quoting from a book of horoscopes: she found that the Icwar ian s are bold, welcome action and are full of fig ht and fire. With due regard to the prerogative of men to grow beards, the men of I.C. were as sig ned to Capricornus the Goat. They are obstinate, domineering and too easily depressed. At the ment ion of beards Bill Hazel's face was wreathed in smiles, but at the mention of Goat his countenance\ndropped. Miss Mahon, drawing analogies from certain socialized insects, with true feminine logic foresaw the day when the women would assume their rightful place in I.C. Mary Re avil l then proposed the toast of the guests. She welcomed the several Presidents not by office but by name there by paying a neat comp li ment. On being graciously referred to as the chi ef champ tion of women's rights Dai Nicholas rose to bow acknowledgement, but his neighbour, expecting one of Dai's famous retorts, hastily restrained him.\nThe Guest of Honour, Miss Kathleen Ferrier, the famous operatic and concert singer, replied on\nbehalf of the guests in a short but charming speech.\nThe dinner was adjudged by all present to be\na signal success, g astronomically, vocally and socially.

E? miles.The\nconditions for the rao e were far from ideal. There\nwas a cold, blustering wind blowing against the runners at the s taif t, down Rotten Row.\nTwenty-two teams lined up for the start, a record number for the event. Every one went away\nvery fast - the first two hundred yards were almost\na flat sprint. At Marble Arch, it was seen that\nL.S.E., Lough borough, R.V. Gigg's team, and King's were well up in fiu mt t with I.C. running a disorganized t welt h. This order was maintained until the sed on d lap, but I.C. began to move up to eighth\nposition; Loughb&rough, after two laps were some\n100 yd s. clear Of King's, with R.V. Gigg's team and\nL.S.E. well back. After four laps King's had overtaken Loughborough, and had built up a convincing\nlead - I.C. by virtue of some excellent running by\nG.C. Kay and M. Garrod were now running third, ahead\nof Birmingham and Manchester, with Battersea Poly.,\nthe holders in sixth position. These positions\nwere maintained during the fifth lap, with King's increasing their lead, and I.C. struggling with\nBirmingham Univ. for third place. During the\nfinal lap s me really fine running was seen - T. Betteridge of King's broke the tape some 300 yd s. ahead of J. Disley, Loughborough - the British International Steeplechaser. Ted Whitlock ran in third for I.C., well ahead of L. Hughes, of-'Birmingham.\nIt is significant to note that the first nine,\nteams home beat last year's record time made by Battersea Poly. - this reflects the astonishing rise\nin the standard of running.\nFinal po s it1 on s:1.

Barrett (Battersea) 13 - 49\nJohn Disley's time constitutes a new record for the course, and Ted Whitlock's time also beat the\nprevious reo or d. The I.C.2 nd team, who also competed, came in a very creditable twelfth, behind L.S.E. I.C. put up a very commendable performance in this event and the results show that we are still in the for front of university a th let ios. AN ON A WINS In the last and most successful Brains Trust,\nheld on Monday 26th Febiraary, Mr- Haskell was barely able to control Miss Anona Winn, Miss Ursula\nJeans, Mr. Kingsley % rt in, Prof. Hall, and Prof.\nLevy, who each had a chance to expound on' their own\npet subject.,;' * \u00ab to. i aw cX Io.\\; ii9i iS The most excited discussion of all, however,\nwas on the subject of the comparative efficiency of the sexes.\nTo a strictly technical audience the point\nwas made that there had been no outstanding creative\nwoman artists. Had this Brains Tpust been held\nwith the R.C.A., R.C.M. and R.C.D. A. as our guests,\nthis point would have kept South Kensington in a state of gentle uproar for many moons.\nIt was gratifying to see that, when asked how\nto dispose of \u00a310,000 our guests, all wanted to help\nthe impecunious student, with the exception of one\nwho wanted to start up a rival to FELIX.\nA 'quickie' showed that the Brains Trust would\nlike to walk on forbidden mountain paths, lose their identity cards, perform uncensored plays, drink all night and repeal Order 1305-REFECTORY CHANGES CATERING FIRM'S PROPOSALS WELCOMED\nAt the last meeting of the Refectory\nCommittee the representative of the Catering Firm,\nMiss Blundell, outlined the proposed changes wh i oh would come into force after Easter. Miss Blundell\non behalf of Messrs. John Gardner, has been in charge of the Refeotory at Guy's Hospital Medioal\nSchool and University College for some time past.\nShe will now add Imperial College to her responsibilities. iia.Jiu.apr -n. \u00bb\nThe principal changes proposed are as\nfol J^j jj j f7) \u00abx9e iu o3v iBn ib 'io * s dj j tr tsi hiatt bi of lSm1.

Suppers, like lu no he s, will be on an a, la carte basis.\nAll complaints will be dealt with by Miss\nBlundell, and not directly by the local manage-ment. Miss Blundell will meet the Catering Subcommittee at frequent Intervals. All suggestions\nand complaints should be made as at present by\ndropping a note into the suggestions box in the\nLower Dining Hall. The Committee after detailed consideration,\ngave whole-hearted approval to the above\nproposals. It was emphasized that arrangements\nwould be made for refunds on all tickets after the reopening of the Refectory on 29th. Maroh.\nENGINEERS CUP trio\nThe R.S. M. defeated C&G. by a goal (5 pts.)\nto a penalty goal (3 pts.) in the annual cup match\nat. Harlington on Feb. 28th. The game was fast but\nmore notable for its vigour, and successful spoil ing, than for constructive football. Guilds took\nthe lead early on with a penalty goal kicked by Lappin, and retained their three point lead until ten\nminutes from the end. , Then bad positioning in defence by Guilds' three quarters allowed Curry to score\nfrom a good back movement in which the Mines' forwards also took part. Davies converted the try from a wide angle, the ball bouncing on the cross-bar\nbefore going over. Both sides had earlier failed to take their opportunities to score , and on the\nafternoon's play there was little to choose between\nthem, although R.S. M. had the livelier and more\ndisciplined pack. - : se il qe i Tottrdf.\nGUILDS MEN FRUSTRATED Arising from the frustration of certain students\nof their Electrical Department, the Guilds Meeting\non Monday 26th Feb. devoted most t>t its time to a motion-proposing that Union membership should be extended t q the secretaries of the College. This proposal to Lily the Guilds provided an excellent sub-j ect for an all-male meeting; despite the arguments\nof the reciprocal social and athletic advantages,the\nmotion was overwhelmingly defeated. However, the\nPresident promised to pursue some of the points rai sed. _\nImp.\n\n"

When asked further why\nhe doesn't get digs near the college, the reply usually given shows that he has never considered it seriously, and has become accustomed to the travelling, He thinks that digs near to college will be expensive or difficult to obtain. In the Dec. 1 5 this sue of FELIX there appeared an advertisement offering the share of a flat, only2 minutes' walk away from I.C., with3 ex Guilds students for25/ a week. Here was a gift from the gods, and yet it was ONE MONTH before anyone took advantage ox um.oui i er. Wake\nup, I.C.'. Most of us may not be fortunate enough\nto be a resident, but there is no reason why we\ni hould not be nearly so. With some perseverance it j^s possible to find a furnished room at about 30/-, cook one's own\nbreakfast and eat in the Union in the evening, at little more expense than living in the hostel. So\nlet us have 1,500 students living in South Ken. We\nwill then have, in effect, a residential college, \u2022\nand through this a far greater number will benefit themselves and the college by participation incorporate university life. PERSONAL NOTE\nAfter some months of persuasion, entreaty and cajolery John Midgley has agreed to take on\nthe editorship of Felix for the remainder of the year. Mr. Midgley has been successively( and successfully) Sports Editor and Production Manager.\nI feel that there are two very good reasons\nwhy the Editorship should change twice yearly. In the first place the fortnightly appearance of Felix leaves the Editor( and his staff) regularly exhausted each fortnight. As far as I can Judge, a term or30 of this is enough for any man. In the second place, Felix is still a growing cat, and\nbesides a regular diet of fortnightly contributions requires new ideas to keep him healthy and lively. A change of Editor twice a year seems the best way\nto ensure this. In conclusion I would like to thank the whole Editorial Board fe r their loyal and able support during the past five months; especially would I thank Mr. Midgley and wish him a successful term of office. C.M. Hargreaves.\nOur Contributor replies( see opposite): Sir When I wrote' Culture in I.C.1I expected some letters in answer, but never didI dream that the great PTH would condescend to reply himself. Yet here I have a whole article by him. Oh,Touchs to ne!I am enraptured!( It is, of course, a disappointment that the article is quite the most\nhysterical, irrelevant, insipid piece of writing that has ever found its way into FELIX). PTH, but I cannot allow these dashes to remain; let me\ncall him Patch Patch tries to answer me with ridicule and invective, although he seems to have a twinge of conscience at the end of his polemic( that' s a kind little Patch!). He accuses me of identifying culture with the arts wilful misrepresentation, Patch! He applies the adjective' high brow' to me, apparently because I admire Turner. What a lowbrow Patch it is! The most inane remark\nin Patch' s article( truly a thing of shreds and Patch' s), however, is his nai've statement that\" scientists\" and\" artists\" can\" all meet as equal beings\" Now you are being conceited, Patch; one day, when\nyou have looked at Turner, and seen 'The Consul' and watched the ballet, you will be sorry for having said that you will feel so ashamed of yourself. I am afraid that Patch, by refusing even to attempt to meet any of the criticisms in my article, has merely underlined what I wrote. He has himself proved the folly of 'Touchstone' and the futility of 'Ends and Means', but,what is indeed a volt e face, he has shown up the project for inter college activities among\nthe students of I.C.,R.C. A. and R.C.M. for what it really is a pitiful mixture of misapplied zeal and unprecedented ingenuousness by je jiu ne idealists who have dimly realised that, by being scientists, they are only partly living their lives. Howe ver, he meant well. D. G.R, VIEWPOINT \u2014\nThe Editor takes no responsibility for views\nexpressed in this column.\nCULTURE IN I.C.A Naughty little D. G.R. How we wonder what you are! Up above I.C. so high, Wallowing in your cultural sky. Music, Opera, Ballet too, Scientist, Artist, Writer you Must not mind if some of us Decline to make an awful fuss Over such distinguished menT hey' requite beyond our common 'Ken'.\nThe Editor of FELIX is to be congratulated on having found in our midst a brilliant writer of lamp o on s, a veritable Sir Benjamin Backbite, a daw-pluck er,a clapper claw, a reviler, avit up erat or, a castigator without equal. True to the honesty and high purpose which has\never animated our greatest exponents of the pas quin a de, he forth fight ly lets it be known that he is a Mr. D GE, admitting that the present writer is a Mr. PTH, a man of no leisure and less( thank God!) culture. It is obvious, I think, that Mr- D. G.R.is an\nunsuccessful hack journalist who has 'taken up Science' just as he has' taken up Culture'. It is equally obvious that he has readS. Potter on1 Wr ite r ship' and knows that one must 'Go One Better or You Go One Worse'. He doubtless remembers how\nHJ of I. C.(B. Sc. Hons Physics, Failed) got to the top in scientific criticism by the simple method of cont in a ally asserting that \"the weakness in J.'J. Thompson's argument lies in his ignorance of the electron theory\". D. G.R. uses the com..ion method of' wilful misunderstanding' over the phrase' University of S. Kensington' which has been bru it ed about since our meeting with R.6.A. and R.C.M. He knows full well, as we all do, that such a conception is a red herring, a dangerous deviation from the more con serva t ive aims of those responsible for Inter College activities. However, at the last he falls head first into the pit constantly awaiting such culture mongers as\nhimself: he overreaches himself. His incredibly naive conception of culture, and how to obtain it, reveals itself in his list of desirable activities the Turner exhibition, the Swedish ballet, the Meno tt i opera. It is really so tragic that one can't laugh, even when one imagines dear old D. G.R. at the exhibition, catalogue in hand, pencil to the fore, standing well back (\"Mustn'tg \"et too close to a Turner, old man - spoils the ATMOSPHERE, you know\")\nhead cocked on one side, a severely critical expression on his sensitive features, mouthing some imp-res sive phrase picked out of last week's Studio. We see his brand of culture revealed in all its highbrow hypocrisy by the suggestion that if one \"goes to\" exhibitions of painting, or ballet, or opera, the nip so facto one is cultured. 'What\npreposterous, misleading, tragic non sen iK this is! He does not want us to mix v. ith artists and musicians and talk normally about normal things, allowing the distillate of our fundamentally different attitudes to influence each other. He does\nnot want ' joint functions', where we can all meet\nas equal beings, without the labels of' scientist1 and ' artist' which normally repel us. No, D. G.R. wants us all to join the great regiment of the pseudo cultured, who rush madly to read the' latest book' ( i.e. the one Harold Ili cho lson has favoured in his latest review), to see the' latest play'( i.e. the one being performed under private licence at the Bolton s), to be able to babble about Kafka, and Leopard i, and Bartok, and\nMahler, and Chagall and Rainer Maria Rilke. Poor old D. G.R.! No wonder he doesn't like 'Touchstone' or 'Ends and Means', since he can.lt\nfind anyone there to bamboozle with the latest theory on Atonality( carefully picked out of several obscure magazines), because they aren't interested in Culture: they are there because of a desire to know something about other people's work and ideas and to tell them about their own.\nWe could go on for pages pointing out the great gaps in his facade; but, as normal human\nbeings, not desiring to impress with our knowledge,\nor our culture, or our pretensions, we will let him off with this warning: I hold it is not decent, for a scientific gent, To say another is an as s atleast, to all intent, Nor should the individual who happens to be meant\nReply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent.
