Smart hands got\nthe ball round the full back through\nLumber-joe Chopper McGrail and\nAlex Amato, before Nielsen-Scott\ngot back on the end of it to dot the\nI\nmperial hosted Kings\u2019 Medics\nat Harlington, looking for\na win to bounce back from\na disappointing defeat last\nweek. IC got off to a bright start,\ndominating possession, territory\nand hitting hard in the contact.\nHowever, errors crept in at crucial\nstages, allowing the unspoilt Kings\u2019\ntryline to somehow remain intact.\nAfter 25 minutes all the home side\nhad to show for their dominance was\na single penalty from resident South\nAfrican, Charles \u201cI can\u2019t remember\nthat Japan game\u201d Price-Smith.\nThe team had also taken a\ndevastating casualty with the loss\nof Tom Hedley to a broken rib.\nThe team wept, but through their\ntears they could see victory on the\nhorizon. As the half moved on,\na couple of infringements gave\nthe medics a bit of territory in\nthe imperial half. Kings managed\nto work an overlap and send the\nwinger in some space down their\nleft hand side.\nWith the ultra reliable Billy\nSixtrees deciding to take a ten-minute breather (having spent the\nrest of the half slicing through the\nKings defence),we were left without\na natural full back,and Kings scored\nin the corner,giving them a 5-3 lead\ngoing into the break.\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take Imperial\nlong to regain the advantage after\nhalf time.\nA few strong phases of play\nsucked the away defence in tight,\nand Charles sent Captain, and\nall round top bloke who does not\nball down for a score, with the extra\n2 added from the boot of PriceSmith.\nAfter this breakthrough, IC never\nlooked back, playing together with\nfar more cohesion and confidence.\nGood pressure at the lineout from\nAli Zaboronsky forced the ball\nloose, sending author of this article,\nDavid Nielsen-Scott scything\nthrough the line like a faster and\nmore handsome Bryan Habana. A\nsimple pop to recently converted\nrower, Hugh Wilman got him over\nthe line.\nIn this act, row row rower, Hugh\nmanaged in his first start something\nthat has evaded housemate Tom\nHobson for over three years, and\nhe did not forget to scream about it\nin the bar later. With this Imperial\nwere firmly in the ascendency at 15-5.\nFrom the resulting kick off,\nNathan Tomlinson got his tree\ntrunks rolling and dragged four\nKing\u2019s defenders 15 metres up the\npitch. Hard carries from Moorby\nand Clayton blasted IC up the\npitch. A small knock on from kings\ngave IC a scrum in a good attacking\nposition. A slick scrum move,\nstarting with Zaboronsky,sent DNS\ninto space again. Good support\nfrom Ed Durkin saw the electric\nscrum half zip in underneath the\nposts, with CPS adding the extras.\nNot content with this, IC went in\nsearch of the 4 try bonus point. A\npowerful maul got Wilman within\ncentimeters from doubling his tally\nfor the day, but fortunately fresher\nJames Field was on hand to grab his\nfirst score in IC colors, and to bring\nall 5 points back to ACC, with the\nfinal score 27-5.\nMedic Kings toppled by Imperial Might\nDavid Nielsen-Scott\n1st XV Captain The team\nwept, but\nthrough their\ntears they\ncould see\nvictory on the\nhorizon.\nImmortal no more: Lions take the glory\nA\nfter a successful\nscrimmage last Saturday,\nthe Immortals travelled\nup to Birmingham for\ntheir season opener against the\nUniversity of Birmingham Lions.\nAfter the disappointing loss from\nlast year against the 5-time national\nchampions, we were unable to turn\nthe tables around and were beaten\nby 47-0.The first quarter started out\npoorly for both defence and offense,\nwith the defensive team conceding\nearly on in the game and the offense\nstruggling to create chances to rush\ndown field or complete passes.\nHaving many starters either\ninjured or unable to play, the\nImmortals lacked fresh faces on the\nfield and were unable to make big\ndifferences in the second quarter\nending the first half with the score\nof 41-0 to the Lions.\nThere was a lot of frustration\nduring half time, however with the\nexperience of the returning veterans\nand our new head coach, the team\u2019s\nmorale was lifted at the end of the\nbreak and the players came out\nto start the second half strongly.\nDefence overall were looking much\nmore solid relative to the first half,\nwith the defensive line and the\nlinebackers reducing the Lion\u2019s\noffensive advancement compared to\nthe previous half and the defensive\nbacks improved on coverage and\nwith Aidan \u2018The Hulk\u2019Bohill having\na chance to intercept the ball.\nOffensively, the Immortal\u2019s o-line\nhad much more success with pass\nprotection; opening up many\nmore chances for our Quarterback\nto complete passes. The second\nPanukorn Taleongpong\nImmortals Publicity officer\nhalf ended with the Immortals\nconceding once in the final seconds\nof the match adding 6 more points\nclosing the game.\nDespite a disappointing result,\nthere were many positives to take\ninto account especially in the second\nhalf.\nOur defensive MVPs this week\nare: Matt \u2018has had enough\u2019 Blackett\n\u2013 defensive rookie MVP for fighting\nthroughout the game making\nessential tackles and all defensive\nlinemen \u2013 overall defensive MVP\nImmortals\nlacked fresh\nfaces on\nthe field and\nwere unable\nto make big\ndifferences in\nthe second\nquarter\nfor holding their ground causing\ntrouble for the opposing running\nbacks.\nOur offensive MVPs are the\nfollowing: Handsome Dan\nGrumberg \u2013 offensive rookie MVP\nfor showing a consistently strong\nperformance throughout the match\nand Marcus \u2018MSH big bush\u2019 SteadHall \u2013 overall offensive MVP for\nmany great plays, most notably\ntaking the ball on a fall back dive\nand generally, throwing out many\ngreat cut blocks.\nThe overall MVP was Markus \u2018the\ngigantic-headed\u2019 Mohr for making\nmore than a few above average plays\nand for playing his heart out on\nboth defence and offense.\nLastly, Nigvi \u2018Rufio\u2019 Tam received\nthe new iron man award for playing\nrestlessly both ways. The Immortals\nnow take these experiences forward\nto their training sessions during\nthe 3-week break in the hopes of\nimproving as a team before facing\nthe Bath Killer Bees on Sunday the\n22nd\nof November.\nWith many starters unable to play, Immortals were disadvantaged from the off.

Madness \u2013 this\nbloke must think we can\u2019t cook\nfor toffee! Well, I\u2019ve taken all the\nfeedback from the few of you who\ndid read it and not think it was a\ncomplete pile of garbage, and am\ngoing to focus on what you liked \u2013\nthe scientific part of it.Plus,I\u2019ve had\nrecipe requests,so I\u2019ll slip one in this\ntime \u2013 as well as nattering on less, if\nI can. If you feel like i\u2019m insulting\nyour cooking genius,apologies \u2013 I\u2019m\njust trying to change the way you\nmight look at food and why you do\nthe things you do in cooking.\nMash, champ, pommes\nmousseline \u2013 they all focus on that\nstaple ingredient, the humble spud.\nIt\u2019s so versatile \u2013 and I will go on to\nwrite about the many other things\nyou can do with it \u2013 but mash\nhappens to be my favourite way of\nusing them. Simply done, with a\nlittle bit of dripping from a roast \u2013\nnothing can compare for me.\nHowever, I\u2019ve always struggled\nwith lumps. And no, I don\u2019t need\nto see a doctor \u2013 these are of the\nimproperly cooked potato variety.\nAnd my mother\u2019s mash would\nsometime be a teensy bit gloopy\n\u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019ve both\nStraight\naway,\na clear\nenemy\nwas found,\nstarch\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nWriter\nSmash might be easy, but it won\u2019t impress your housemates like this will\nSimply\ndone, with\na little bit\nof dripping\nfrom a\nroast \u2013\nnothing can\ncompare\nMmmm, just like your mamma makes. Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nmade great mash before, but just\nnot consistently. Somehow, the\nvariations we did \u2013 ever so subtle,\nlike the types of potatoes, the length\nof boiling or how well we let them\nsteam dry \u2013 really screwed things\nup. I thought it was time I mastered\none of the simpler dishes out there,\nso I had a look into it.\nAnd straight away, a clear enemy\nwas found \u2013 starch. Or rather, what\nhappens when starch and water\nmix. As granules of amylose and\namylopectin interact with water,\nstarch swells and then bursts,\nforming a gel matrix over time \u2013 it is,\nin fact, a non-newtonian fluid. This\nproduct is responsible for the least\ndesirable feature \u2013 gummy mash. So\nclearly regulating the exposure of\nthe potatoes to water is a problem.\nI had also encountered a second\nproblem \u2013 uneven cooking.\nNaturally, as the pieces of potato\nare boiled, the surfaces heat up and\ncook through much faster than\nthe middles. If this is extreme,\nyou can have just cooked interiors\nwith mushy exteriors, and this is\nexactly what happens if you cut\nyour potatoes up into pieces that are\nirregular or just too large! And this\ngives you lumps \u2013 my second enemy.\nI did have to question my sanity,\nspending time researching mash\nwhilst I could be focusing on my\nlab project, but I had found what I\nneeded to solve. And the solution is\nvery simple.\nIn both cases, water is not helping\nus. It swells the starch and ruins\nthe fluffy lightness that mash\nshould have, and forces us to cut\nour potatoes up \u2013 which not only\ncan lead to uneven cooking, but\nalso exposes even more of the cells\nand their contained starch to the\nwater, worsening the problem! So,\neliminate the water!\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 bake your potatoes!\nWe can all admit that scooping out\nthe middle of a baked potato, and\ncrudely mixing it with some butter\nand cheese, is one of life\u2019s simple,\ndelicious, pleasures. By using the\nindirect heat of an oven, and being\nable to cook potatoes with their\nskins on, you not only speed up the\nwhole process (not having to peel\npotatoes is a godsend!) but also\nhide the starch away from water\n\u2013 not that there should be any,\nin your oven anyway! The insides\nare perfectly cooked from edge to\nedge, so the lumps are gone. In one\nfell swoop, we have beaten both\nenemies!\nThe potatoes can be simply baked\nalongside the chicken \u2013 though\nnot in the same pan, mind \u2013 before\nbeing taken out to have their guts\nremoved. Beautifully soft potatoey\ngoodness \u2013 so light, you can mash\nwith a spoon. A touch of butter,\npepper, salt and you\u2019re away.\nSmashing.\nSanjay\u2019s best ever Mash\nThis is enough for four hungry\npeople with no regard for keto diets\nor their waistlines.\nShopping List\n\u2022 16 baking potatoes, of a\nsimilar size - any variety will\ndo, but King Edward are\nubiquitous and great.\n\u2022 50-100g unsalted butter\n\u2022 White pepper (who am I\nkidding, you can use black,\nbut try to grind it fresh)\n\u2022 Salt\n\u2022 8 Metal Skewers\nMethod\nPreheat your oven to 200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C\nFan.\nTake your baking potatoes, and\nuse a knife to score a line through\nthe skin lengthwise around the\npotatoes.\nThread two potatoes per skewer,\nalong their long axis.\nBake for approximately an hour,\nthough it can take longer - up to\ntwo hours if you want them super\neasy to work.\nCheck doneness by slipping\na knife into them \u2013 it should\nencounter resistance from the skin,\nbut nothing else.\nTake the potatoes out of the oven,\nand whilst they\u2019re hot, remove them\nfrom the skewers.\nLeave to cool for about 15 minutes,\nuntil you can just handle them.\nPull them in half, and use a spoon\nto scrape the perfectly cooked flesh\ninto a bowl \u2013 or,if you want,directly\ninto a sieve.\nIf you discover they\u2019re not cooked\nthrough \u2013 don\u2019t panic! Simply return\nto the oven for another 20 minutes\nor until done.\nEither way, mash them gently, by\nrubbing through the sieve or against\nthe side of the bowl with a spoon\n\u2013 they should just disintegrate and\nform a smooth paste.\nUsing a fork, stir the mash with\nthe butter until it is all incorporated .\nThe amount of butter really depends\non the consistency and richness you\nlike.\nYou can add milk to loosen \u2013\nbut more butter does that job too.\nSeason, and enjoy.\n\n"

Were we always\nlike this? Did Imperial students ever\nget really involved in causes beyond\nour graduate prospects?\nSo I looked back in the archives,\nwhich are handily bound in leather\nand line the walls of the FELIX\noffice, to see when the political\ndissidence ended, or if it was ever\nthere in the first place.\nI stumbled across some sad things,\nespecially in light of Wednesday\u2019s\nfees and cuts demo. 2010 was a big\nyear for student protests. Clegg had\njust broken the Lib Dem promise\nto scrap tuition fees, which would\neventually see his demise from\npolitics completely. FELIX had\nreported on the big shouty protests.\nWe took pictures. There was a small\nfire. We took a picture of that too.\nSomeone threw a fire extinguisher\noff a building (not us though). It\nwas all very exciting.\nOur very own union even took a\nstandpoint on the matter.The union\ncouncil, voted in to represent the\nvoices of Imperial students, voted to\nsupport the Browne review.\nWritten by an ex-head of BP, the\ndocument recommended that any\nA word from the Editor\nEditor-in-Chief\nGrace Rahman\nNews Editor\nCecily Johnson\nComment Editors\nTessa Davey and Vivien\nHadlow\nScience Editors\nJane Courtnell and Lef\nApostolakis\nArts Editors\nIndira Malik, Jingjie Cheng\nand Max Falkenberg\nMusic Editor\nCale Tilford\nFilm Editor\nFred Fyles\nWelfare Editor\nNoor Mulheron\nSports Editors\nKunal Wagle and Josh\nO\u2019Donnell\nPuzzles Editors\nHamish Beck and Roxana\nRadu\nCopy Editors\nMattin Mir-Tahmasebi,\nHenry Lloyd Bates,\nAlexandra Lim, Cassie\nStephenson, Francesca\nSiracusa and Cem Hurrell\nCover Picture by Cale\nTilford\nNews\nComment\nScience\nFood\nClubs & Societies\nArts\nFilm\nMusic\nGames\nPuzzles\nHangman\nSports\n3\n8\n10\n13\n14\n18\n22\n26\n29\n30\n31\n32\nfees cap for home students should\nbe completely removed.Completely.\nRemoved. This didn\u2019t happen in\nthe end, obviously. Fees for home\nstudents at the moment are capped\nat a shocking nine grand, an\nunimaginable sum for those at the\ntime, who were paying only \u00a33,375\nper year, tops.\nOurs was one of the very few\nunions not to officially reject\nthe fee hike, but in addition, our\n\u2018representative\u2019body decided to back\na slightly more draconian policy\nthan even the coalition government\ncould stomach. Seriously.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom.\nBack in 2007, the RCSU had\nbeen promised a new office on\nthe walkway. College Estates then\nbacktracked, leaving them with\nbarely a broom cupboard to operate\nfrom. In protest, the committee\ncreated a makeshift office on\nDalby Court in front of the Faculty\nBuilding (that\u2019s the Blue Cube to\nyou and I), complete with a desk,\ncomputer and sofa. They got their\nspace on the Sherfield walkway in\nthe end.This shit can work, guys!\nIn 2010, the union attempted to\nscupper plans for a life sciences restructure that would see fourteen\nstaff made redundant. When a\nunion council paper called for\nthe re-structure to be halted, 160\nstudents gathered to protest outside\nthe College Senate meeting to\ndecide on the department\u2019s fate.\nStudents wore masks and chanted,\n\u201cSave our plants!\u201d\nThe paper was rejected, and the\ndepartment lost staff. Disappointed\nstudents threatened to get back at\nthe university by writing damning\nNational Student Satisfaction\nSurvey entries. Not quite the\nOCCUPY movement, but an\nImperial protest if ever there was\none.\nFELIX, Beit Quad,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nPrinted by Iliffee Print Cambridge,\nWinship Road, Cambridge\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 FELIX 2015\nLetters (kinda)\nIn response to \u2018My period is not a\nluxury\u2019, Issue 1615\nI would like to remind all members\nof the Imperial College community\n\u2013 both students and staff \u2013 that the\nUnion\u2019s Shop Extra on Sherfield\nWalkway has committed to selling\nfeminine hygiene products \u2018at cost\u2019\nsince March. This was following a\npaper I presented to Union Council\nlast year which gained the support\nof the student body and the shop\nmanagement.\nThis offers women at Imperial a\nsignificantly greater discount on\nfeminine hygiene products than the\nremoval of the 5% VAT rate. I\u2019m\nvery proud to have played my part\n\u2013 and I just wish that the decision\nto remove VAT could be taken at\nParliamentary level and not require\nunanimous agreement between 28\ncountries at European level. That is\nnot democracy.\nShop Extra on Sherfield Walkway\nis open Monday - Friday from 08:30\nuntil 18:00.\nChris Kaye, the union\u2019s Deputy\nPresident of Finance and Services\n(via email)\nThanks for that Chris,any excuse\nto advertise, eh? In fairness, this\nis probably the most productive\nthing that has ever happened at\nunion council. Well done man,\nthis and the pizza bases, what\nhaven\u2019t you given the Imperial\nstudents? Couldn\u2019t save the tree,\nthough, could you?\n-Ed.\nIn response to \u2018I went to the Bond\npremiere\u2019, Issue 1615\nAll I took from this was \u201csmug\nSabb takes advantage of elected role,\nthen writes about how smug she is.\u201d\n\u2018Not impresses [sic]\u2019 (online)\nSteady on there, \u2018Not impresses\u2019.\nI wasn\u2019t in the staff ballot for the\ntickets,andI\u2019mnoteventhisbitter.\n-Ed.\nAre you gunna report on this?\nDude who brought part of Beit\nquad tree\u2019s trunk, which had been\nchopped down by the union, into the\nFELIX office (in person)\nYes.\n-Ed.\nIn response to \u2018Why are Imperial\nstudents so apathetic about\npolitics?\u2019, Issue 1615\nWhile you raise the point of\nUnion Council, do ask yourself the\nquestion \u2013 is Council really that\nrepresentative of the students it is\nsupposed to represent?\nI personally found in previous\nyears that Council has actually been\nmore interested in the ideologies\nof the people in it, rather than of\nmyself and my peers.\nI guess its hard when you vote for\nthe funny manifesto rather than any\nconcrete policies \u2013 when I voted I\nalways found all the manifestos\nto say the same thing (\u201cpower to\nstudents\u201d) instead of anything\nconcrete with the exception of\nAndrew Tranter who I think\ndeserves a huge amount of credit\nirrespective of whether you agree\nwith his point of view or not!\nHopefully this democracy review\nI read about will fix it \u2013 maybe\nCouncil will be more successful\nat lobbying when it has a stronger\nmandate from the student body to\ncampaign on issues it cares about?\n\u2018Ex-student\u2019 (online)\nAndrew, is that you? Can\u2019t help\nbut agree with you on the council\nthing. I went to my first the other\nday. As a non-member, at one\npoint I tried to ask a question,\nand my right to do even that was\nquestioned. At one point we\ntook a vote about whether or not\nwe should write down how each\nperson voted on each motion. It\u2019s\nhack-y, pinickity, and aggressive,\nbut if a standard cross-section of\nstudents don\u2019t turn up, what\u2019s the\nalternative? Should we just have\nreferendums for everything, like\nthat dude who ran to be an MP\nand said he would use Facebook\npolls to decide how to vote in\nparliament?\n-Ed.\n\n"

Following on from him\nTom Hicks took centre stage to\ntry out some new material, with\na notepad and pen he guided the\nonlookers through a few of his good\n(and bad) ideas. Leaving the stage\nwith the knowledge that Swiss army\nknives are funny.\nThen, the moment everyone\nhad been waiting for, Imperial\nborn and bred comedian Josh\nCarr made his way through the\nProfessors of comedy cheer up Metric\nSion James in action at Imperial Photo Credit: Imperial College Union\nPeter Munton\nWriter\nFunny and\ncringe-worthy\ncrowd, clipboard in hand, up to\nthe stage. His character of a nerdy\ncollege professor suited his geeky\ndemeanour and unsurprisingly\nrelated to the Imperial crowd. Josh\ntold a story of his childhood and\nadolescence, as well as his early\nmanhood. Cracking up the crowd\nwith funny and cringe-worthy\ntales in a self-deprecating manner.\nFinishing off with his Riddler\naudition and a theory about black\nholes, it was time for the interval.\nAfter the interval Imperial\nComedy\u2019s very own president Arran\nHobson Sayers bounded to the\nstage for a surprise set, delighting\nthe hard-core comedy goers with\nsnappy jokes and a stylistically\nunique presentation of safety signs.\nHeadliner Stuart Goldsmith then\ngrabbed the audience\u2019s attention\nwith a hilarious account of his\nimpending parenthood and his\ntheories about babies. He then\nlaunched into a laughter ridden\nchronicle of mattocks ending the\nnight with a roar, undeniably a\ncomedian to watch out for.\nNice N\u2019 Spikey hosts stand-up\ncomedy nights every month in the\nunion bar, the next one will be on\nMonday 7th\nof December so come\nand check out some of Imperial\u2019s\nfinest comic talent.\nI\nn 1956, the widows of the\nSusan B. Anthony Society\nfor the Sisters of Gertrude\nStein meet in a renovated\ncommunity centre for their annual\nbreakfast, where the prize-winning\nquiche will be declared in a much-anticipated ceremony. The sudden\nthreat of an atomic bomb forces\nthe women in this idyllic American\ntown to begin sharing their deepest\nsecrets, which lead to some not-so-shocking confessions from the\nsociety\u2019s leaders.\nI went to a comedy gig recently\nwhere one performer opined that\n\u201cthe problem with football fans is\nthey think that watching 100s of\nhours of something makes them\nan expert. If that were really true,\nI would be the best lesbian lover in\nthe world.\u201d\nWas he referring to Imperial\nCollege DramSoc\u2019s production of\n\u201cFive Lesbians Eating a Quiche\u201d\n(FLEQ), directed by Elena Stein?\nProbably not,but that\u2019s his loss.This\nwas a show that took a superb script\nand brought it to life through a\ncombination of quality production,\nimmersive audience interaction and\nmost importantly an excellently\ncast group of actresses who left me\nquestioning my distaste for quiche.\nThe show opens with the five\nmembers of the Susan B. Anthony\nSociety entering from the rear of\nthe Union Concert Hall, who talk\nto the audience as they walk towards\nthe stage.Some of those approached\nlooked quite terrified, though\nwhether this was because of the\nsurprise of being spoken to during\na play or because Imperial students\nin general are frightened of social\ninteraction was unclear. Regardless,\nit was a unique start that could have\nquite easily gone wrong, but rather\ndemonstrated immediately that the\nactresses didn\u2019t feel constrained or\nrigid and robotic in their assumed\ncharacters, but rather composed\nand fluid. From the moment they\nassume the stage, we as an audience\nare under the impression we are\nwitnessing an event far greater than\nany of us: the unveiling of the prize\nwinning quiche.\nOur immersion in this 50\u2019s cold\nwar setting is amplified by Amanda\nWilliamson\u2019s set. The Wall of Past\nPresidents of the society looms\ntall above the 5 senior members\n(the audience are given name tags\nand treated as lesser members\nthroughout), whilst the gawkish\nand repugnant wallpaper will seem\nfamiliar to those who lived in\nthese times/Fisher Hall. The only\nmoment it really falls short is when\na door described as being \u201cmilitary\ngrade\u201d and \u201cradiation proof\u201d is\nslammed shut only for it to shake\nand nearly fall off its hinges. The\nlighting (Elena Stronach) is spot\non throughout, contributing one of\nthe show\u2019s biggest laughs, and the\nsound design (Robert Sch\u00fcssler) is\nprofessional and well executed\nWhat makes this show truly\nmemorable, however, is the quality\nof the acting. Acting is like cooking;\nyou don\u2019t need to know anything\nabout how it\u2019s done to appreciate\nit when it\u2019s performed well. This is\na good thing, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to write this review. When\n\u201cDale\u201d (Olivia Gatliff) is killed by\nradiation (if you cared so much about\nspoilers you would have bothered to\nwatch the play, you philistine), the\nWe wonder if they\u2019ll ever be able to eat quiche again.

Not since the days of\nmy old all-boys school have I seen\nsexual innuendo so wonderfully and\ncreatively delivered. It\u2019s sharp and\nzippy, with pauses and punchlines\ntimed to perfection. The withering\nand barely veiled insults thrown\naround the room (and indeed the\naudience) by Lulie (Anisha Kadri)\nand Vern (Lucy Luo) are as barbed\nand cutting as the playwrights\nwould have wanted them to be.\nAliya Ismailova\u2019s portrayal of\nGinny wouldn\u2019t have been quite as\nconvincing without her authentic\nMancunian accent, which serves\nboth to contrast against the brusque\nAmerican twangs of the other\nmembers, but also as a reminder of\njust how awful many northerners\nsound. So said the pretend critic\nfrom Birmingham.\nWould it be hyperbolic to say this\nwas the best play I\u2019ve seen at IC\nsince I arrived two years ago? It\u2019s\ndifficult to say, but that in itself is\ntestament to how wonderful this\nproduction was.\n\n"

I was on the guest list!\nRatatat is serious business. Their\nsense of groove is among the best in\nthe industry.Since I base my writing\non tired aphorisms, I\u2019ll save the best\nfor last, for I have a few words about\nthe DJ who opened that night.\nThe lack of stage presence left me\nfloored. I initially thought to myself,\n\u201cOh, they\u2019ve turned up the house\nmusic a bit\u201d, before looking up and\nrealizing there was actually someone\non stage,spinning a feeble attempt at\ndream-step-night-core-whatever-the-hell-the-kids-are-into-these-days. I spent the next hour and a\nhalf cursing my punctuality, bland\nnoise killing my eardrums.\nOkay, it wasn\u2019t all bad \u2013 up on\nthe mezzanine, I could watch the\ncrowd.White people approximating\nthe act of dancing is always sort\nof entertaining, in the same\nschadenfreude way that watching\nRussian dash-cam videos on\nYouTube is oddly satisfying.\nI should mention that I have no\nidea who this DJ is; he managed\nnot to say an entire word during\nhis 90-minute set. What a champ.\nAt least he eventually got off the\nthey were jaw-dropping. Mike\nStroud (guitars, drums, and synths)\nand Evan Mast (bass, drums, more\nsynth, and production) form a\ntwo-piece that manages to pump\nout some of the most righteous\ngrooves that my well-worn-out\nears have heard. Ratatat sounds\nlike an instrumental cross between\nAlabama Shakes and an edgier\nMGMT, with an impressive\npresence \u2013 their sound has been\ndescribed as \u201c89 guitars on stage\ntogether\u201d, a valid descriptor for the\nwall-of-sound approach they favour.\nA paradox seemed to emerge.\nTwo people, but a busy soundscape.\nRatatat relies heavily on prerecorded beats and synth rips;\nusually, this would feel like cheating\nto me, but Mast and Stroud have\ntheir hands full on stage in a\nconstant frenzy of gnarly jams, so\nI let it slide. In fact, this is possibly\nthe most notable feature of Ratatat\u2013\nsomething is always happening.\nEven when they\u2019re droning, there\u2019s\nsomething funny with the rhythm,\nor a background synth is creeping\nup the scale in a way that makes the\nsong sound constantly in motion.\nWhen either runs out of things\nto do on an instrument, they switch\ninstruments. A couple of times\nduring the set, Stroud would put\ndown his guitar and start playing\na keyboard mid-verse! During the\nencore, both played a thunderous\ndrum duet, occasionally breaking\nout for bass fills or a riff here and\nthere.\nRatatat bring the jam like your aunt does at tea time. Photo Credit: Electric Brixton\nHenry Eshbaugh\nWriter\nRatatat funkify Brixton\nStroud\u2019s apparent love of guitar\neffects added to the heaviness of\nthe sound, taking a sweet, syrupy\nStratocaster and running it through\nreverbs, flangers, and OD pedals \u2013\na masterclass on how to properly\nuse an effects board. Mix in his\ntechnical guitar skills and you have\na very capable lead. Mast\u2019s playing\nwas also noteworthy: the multi-instrumentalist managed to rip out\nsome pretty slick bass runs, though\nStroud really stole the show in terms\nof sonic awesomeness.\nThe visual side of the presentation\nis reminiscent of the prog rock\ndays of yore \u2013 laser light carved\nthrough the smoke in undulating\nsheets, and it was super neat-o.\nPlus, Mast edits videos together to\nshow on a projector, which are\u2026\nabstract. Abstract and sometimes\nuncomfortable. Watch the music\nvideo for their song \u2018Drugs\u2019to get an\nidea of the unnerving side; the rest,\nhowever, was impressive. A looping\nvideo of shattering marble statues!\nHow much more awesome does it\nget?\nOverall, the show was a blast\n\u2013 Stroud and Mast are intense\nlive in a way that can\u2019t really be\ncommunicated, even by listening\nto the studio versions of the songs.\nNext time they\u2019re in town, dear\nreader, I recommend that you\ncheck them out for yourself.\nThe sort of disturbing imagery Ratatat uses in their live shows.

The varying time signatures\nand unusual synths place the young\nproducer among the best in the\nWonky genre. While the structures\nof the songs might be unfamiliar,\nthe sounds that Iglooghost uses\nborrow from a diverse range of\nelectronic artists. At times you can\nhear echoes of Arca and Oneohtrix\nPoint Never.\n\u2018Xiangjiao\u2019(which is also the name\nof the album\u2019s protagonist) starts the\nEP at a blisteringly fast 169 bpm,\nwith high pitched, sped up and cut\noff voice samples accentuating the\nspeed.\nIn contrast, the second track of\nthe EP, \u2018Mametchi / Usohachi\u2019\nis far slower. The plips and plops\nsound eerily similar to SOPHIE\u2019s\n\u2018Lemonade\u2019 (one of last year\u2019s most\ninnovative songs). In a parallel\nuniverse, Iglooghost is probably\npart of the PC Music collective.\nIglooghost samples his brother\nthroughout the album but it\u2019s\nespecially noticeable here contrasted\nagainst the low pitched and robotic\nrap verse from \u2018Mr.Yote\u2019.\n\u2018Gold Coat\u2019 is a slower and more\npeculiar track. Its sound is probably\nthe most distinctive on the EP,\nfeaturing Japanese singer/producer\nCuushe\u2019s vocals laid over a bouncing\nbeat and lush synthesisers.\nThe final track \u2018Peach Rift\u2019is easily\nthe least experimental, and can be\nbest described as mediocre EDM\nwith sprinkles on top.\nChinese N\u00fc Yr could only have\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nPurity Ring give robotic performance\nT\nhe electronic duo from\nEdmonton, Alberta\nplayed their second\nLondon gig this year,\ntouring their album another eternity\n\u2013 note the lack of caps, every track\non the album is similarly stylised \u2013\nthe first being at Shepherd\u2019s Bush in\nApril.\nRoundhouse proved to be a venue\ntoo big for this band, as tickets\nfailed to sell out despite prices\nbeing on the more affordable end\nfor London at \u00a320. A cosier venue\nwould have been better suited to\ntheir performance.\nThe stage set-up was impressive,\nas it will be on the rest of the tour;\nlights draped from above, creating\npatterns which changed in time\nwith the music.

The conviction,\nwhich was in direct response to his\nfilms \u2013 described by the Iranian\ngovernment as \u2018propaganda\u2019 \u2013 has\nleft Panahi with a 20-year ban on\ndirecting. Keen readers may have\nnoticed that since then a number\nof films have come out bearing his\nname: This Is Not a Film in 2011;\nClosed Curtain in 2013; and now\nTaxi Tehran, an uplifting, beautiful\nwork which ranks among Panahi\u2019s\nbest.\nTaxi Tehran continues in the vein\nof Panahi\u2019s previous works. Rather\nthan stop making films, he seems\nto have begun twisting the very\ndefinition of cinema itself. This Is\nNot a Film, as the title may suggest,\ncritiqued the very institution and\nprocess that is film-making. It\nfeatures Pahani reading scenes\naloud from the movie he would\nhave made. Closed Curtain, a much\nmore complex tale, features the\nbreakdown between fact and fiction,\nas Pahani makes a rogue appearance\ninto the fictitious narrative as\nhimself. In Taxi Tehran, Pahani gets\nbehind the wheels of a taxi,taking to\nthe streets of Tehran to ferry around\nan array of characters. Filmed in\nreal time, the film poses a number\nof questions about what is real and\nwhat is fake.It is possible that all the\npassengers were actors; or perhaps\nonly some were in on the game, the\nrest being unwitting bystanders.The\nlack of a proper set of credits, done\npresumably to protect the identity\nof those involved in the film, only\ndeepens the confusion \u2013 the only\ncharacter we know by name is\nPahani\u2019s niece Hana, who picked up\nthe Golden Bear at the Berlin Film\nFestival on behalf of her uncle, who\nis forbidden to leave the country.\nLike all of Panahi\u2019s films, Taxi\nTehran takes a roundabout way of\ncritiquing Iranian society, placing\nthe forbidden opinions into the\nmouths of the Iranians themselves.\nThere\u2019s the argument between\npassengers about whether thieves\nshould be executed for their\ncrimes, which ends up taking on\na comic turn; there\u2019s the woman\nwhose husband has gotten into an\naccident which, if proving fatal,\nwill leave her destitute since women\ncannot inherit property; and there\u2019s\nthe human rights lawyer Nasrin\nSotoudeh, persecuted for going\nagainst the regime, who discusses\nwith Panahi the very-real case\nof Ghoncheh Ghavami, a SOAS\ngraduate imprisoned for protesting\nin favour of equal access to sporting\nevents.\nThese are all real issues, whether\nthose discussing them are fictitious\nor not, but the real core of the\nfilm lies in the time Panahi gives\nto explore the issue of filmmaking\nwithin Iran. One of the most\ninteresting characters within the\nfilm is the bootleg DVD seller\nwhom Pahani ferries around as\nhe makes sales of Kurosawa films.\nThere is little doubt that a number\nof the films he carries have been\nbanned \u2013 an idea reinforced by the\nCD seller who approaches the car\nhawking prohibited music \u2013 and\nhis repertoire probably includes a\nnumber of Panahi\u2019s films. Certainly,\nJafar Pahani ferries around passengers in his latest work, Taxi Tehran Photo Credit: New Wave Films\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nThe sheer\njoy of\nfilmmaking\nshines\nthrough\nPanahi\u2019s\nlens\nJafar Panahi is a rebel with a cause\nTaxi Tehran is a defiant, bold work which runs circles around the censors\nthe seller has no problem in\nrecognizing Panahi, despite his\nincongruous position in the front of\nthe taxi cab.\nThe bootlegger is also probably\nthe only way people within Iran can\nsee Panahi\u2019s films, which have been\nbanned.Putting him in the same car\nas Pahani is a stroke of genius, an\nironic twist of the knife that is both\nhumorous and crushing. Similarly,\nPahani\u2019s niece Hana, an aspiring\nfilmmaker herself, takes time to\nexplain rules that accompany her\nschool project to make a short\nfilm: no ties, no men and women\nconversing, and no \u2018sordid realism\u2019.\nWhen she asks what such a claim\nmeans \u2013 indeed, such an idea only\nreinforces the claim most children\nhave that all adults are mad, stupid,\nor both \u2013 Pahani explains, with\na smile, that she would not be\nallowed to include footage of what\nhis passengers have said against\nthe regime, footage that has been\ncaptured by his three hidden\ncameras.\nSuch messages may seem to\nportray Taxi Tehran as a film that is\nbleak, if not depressing \u2013 this could\nnot be further from the truth.While\nPahani\u2019s situation in Iran is indeed\ndire, the sheer joy of filmmaking\nshines through the lens. Indeed,\nwe start the film with a long shot\nfrom the front window of the car as\nPahani drives through the streets of\nhis beloved Tehran; as the camera\nmoves along the roads, taking in a\nview of the capital that seems so far\nremoved from the image television\nseries such as Homeland enforce in\nour minds, we can sense the pure\nenergy,the joie-de-vivre that Pahani\nobtains from filmmaking.\nPolitical without being pushy,\nserious without being dour, Taxi\nTehran deserves to rank among\nthe best of Pahani\u2019s work, and \u2013 by\nextension \u2013 is probably one of the\nbest Iranian films of recent times.\nThe film ends on an ambiguous note\nas masked men break into the car \u2013\nwhether to steal it or to destroy the\nrecording equipment is unknown.\nThis alone is not enough to sully\nthe impression the film leaves on\nits audience, one that can best be\nsummed up in the image of Pahani\u2019s\nwry smile in the face of extreme\noppression.\nTaxi Tehran is out now on limited\nrelease.\nTaxi Tehran\nDir: Jafar Panahi. Script: Jafar\nPanahi.Starring: Jafar Panahi,Hana\nSaeidi. 82 minutes.\nDocumentary corner: Jiro Dreams of Sushi\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nF\nound in a subway station\nof downtown Tokyo and\nseating only a mere ten\npeople, it\u2019s fair to say\nSukiyabashi Jiro is one of the more\ninconspicuous three-Michelin-starred restaurants in the world.\nSince expanding their gaze to the\nFar East, the Michelin guide has\nbecome enchanted by the food\nof Japan, which now boasts more\nthree-starred restaurants than any\nother country \u2013 but there is only\none sushi restaurant on this list. Jiro\nDreams of Sushi tells the story of the\nrestaurant\u2019s owner, oft-touted \u2018best\nsushi chef in the world\u2019, Jiro Ono,\nand his quest to perfect the art of\nsushi making. For all the build-up\nJiro gets in this film, however, we\neventually find out that the head\nchef duties actually belong to Jiro\u2019s\neldest son and heir, Yoshikazu.\nHerein lies the depth of the film.\nThe complexities of this father-son relationship is a major theme\nexplored by director David Gelb;\nquestions are raised over whether\nYoshikazu is good enough to take\nover and whether he even wants\nto do so. Yoshikazu\u2019s working life\nreally just appears to be the result\nof obligation based on traditional\nJapanese ideas of succession and\nresponsibility. It seems that, despite\nthe title, the real story told here \u2013 in\nthe words of the director himself \u2013\nis one of a man \u201cliving in his father\u2019s\nshadow\u201d.\nThe film goes even deeper than\nthis. Much like Gelb\u2019s Netflix series\nChef \u2019s Table, Jiro Dreams of Sushi is\nfocused on documenting the chef\u2019s\npersonal philosophies. For Jiro, the\nend goal of his work is not success,\nbut rather the pride of knowing he\nhas achieved perfection. Perfection\nof one\u2019s craft, he claims, is what\nleads one to a fulfilled life.\nThis is an idea not many can\nempathise with, and it seems\nlike Jiro\u2019s work ethic is what\nhas ultimately cost him what is\ntraditionally important in life:\nfamily, recreation, and enjoying\none\u2019s success. Interestingly enough,\nJiro isn\u2019t alone in this obsession \u2013 he\nis surrounded by very like-minded\npeople. This allows the director to\ncomment on Japanese perfectionist\nattitudes as a whole. For example,\na hidden star of this film is Jiro\u2019s\ntuna supplier who will pack up and\ngo home if he fails to win the fish\nhe wanted that day simply because\n\u201cthere can only be one best fish\u201d.\nOne of Jiro\u2019s junior chefs, we are\ntold, has spent five years cooking\nrice, banned from any responsibility\nuntil Jiro believes he has perfected\nthe task.\nOn a more superficial note, the\nfilm can be enjoyed as what is\nessentially feature-length \u2018food\nporn\u2019. The gorgeous shots of the\nrestaurant\u2019s tasting menu overlaid\nby an orchestral score by Phillip\nGlass is nothing short of beautiful.\nQuiet and tender for minutes at a\ntime, we are treated to gorgeous,\nartistic cinematography which truly\nhelps the viewer understand Jiro\u2019s\nlove of food. Ultimately, this film\nis not an easy celebration of sushi\nand the joy it brings to many, but a\ncomplex exploration of what it takes\nto be the world\u2019s best.\nSushi-master Jiro, with his team, in Jiro Dreams of Sushi Photo Credit: Jiro Dreams of Sushi PR\nFresh Dressed\nDir: Sasha Jenkins.

Starring: Nas, Pharrell\nWilliams, Kanye West, Damon\nDash. 90 minutes.\nL\nong before Will Smith\nhit the streets of Bel-Air,\nthe term \u2018fresh\u2019 was used\nas a compliment. Sacha\nJenkins\u2019 new film, Fresh Dressed,\ntakes the word as a starting point,\nusing it to explore the fascinating\ninfluence of hip-hop on fashion,\na relationship that has defined the\nclothing world for the last 30 years.\nWhile the term \u2018fresh\u2019 has only\nbeen around since the 1980s,Jenkins\nlooks at the history of AfricanAmerican culture.The talking heads\nJenkins gets in do a good job at\ndescribing how, when an oppressed\nminority group is constantly told\nthey are sub-par, they will find their\nown validation, often in the form of\nclothing.\nIn the 1970s, for young people\nof ethnic minorities, this often\nmeant buying into aspirational\nbrands like Gucci. Where Fresh\nDressed really takes off, however,\nis in the exploration of the boom\nof independent black designers\nin the 1980s, working within the\ncommunity, for the community.\nInterviews with Kanye West, Nas,\nand Pharrell Williams highlight\nthe importance clothing brands like\nKarl Kani played in shaping the\npublic image of musicians like TLC\nand Tupac Shakur.\nUnfortunately, with every boom\ncomes a bust, and today there has\nbeen a move back to designers,\nwith A$AP Rocky more likely\nto be rapping about Maison\nMargiela than Crossed Colours.\nJenkins\u2019 theory that the increased\nexpressionism in clothing is tied\nto an increasing acceptance of\nLGBT+ people is interesting, but is\nnot elaborated upon. Similarly, the\ncreative new brands mining street-wear for inspiration, such as Gosha\nRubchinskiy, Nasir Mazhar, or\nCottweiler, are glossed over. Since\nthe topic of the film could easily\ncover multiple PhD theses, this is\nan unsurprising concession.\nYoung men pose with their customised jackets, a mainstay of 1980s street fashion Photo Credit: Jamel Shabazz\nDo I Sound Gay?\nDir: David Thorpe. Writers: David\nThorpe, Maeve O\u2019Boyle. Starring:\nMargaret Cho,George Takei,David\nSedaris. 78 minutes.\nD\nocumentarian David\nThorpe takes himself\nas the basis of his film,\nDo I Sound Gay?, an\nexploration of the stereotypical \u2018gay\nvoice\u2019. Following the dissolution\nof his long-term relationship, his\nconfidence is knocked, in particular\nregarding his voice, which he\nidentifies as nasal, feminine, and\nsimilar to the culturally-ingrained\nidea of a \u2018gay voice\u2019. From this\npoint onwards, the film looks at\nspeech therapy, the views on the\n\u2018gay voice\u2019around the world,and the\nnature of internalised homophobia.\nInterviews with George Takei and\nDavid Sedaris offer an insight into\nthe relationships gay men have\nwith their voices; sadly, Thorpe\nseems to be fixated on the idea that\nrelationships \u2013 and particularly\nmarriage \u2013 can offer those at odds\nwith their voices solace. At these\npoints, the film is arguably least\ninteresting, which is a pity since\nthere are some particularly revealing\nsections, such as the film theorist\nwho tracks the development of the\n\u2018pansy\u2019 archetype in mainstream\nmedia. Ultimately, the film tries to\nexplore too many different fields:\nsocial science, psychoanalysis,\nlinguistic theory and media studies.\nWith a run-time of 78 minutes,\nperhaps it would work better as a\nseries, where Thorpe would be able\nto properly tackle his subjects.\nFRED FYLES\n\n"

Yet,\nonly five years have passed since\nthe death of the rhythm gaming\nindustry. From billions to almost\nnothing, in 2010 Activision could\ndo nothing as one of their most\nlucrative franchises melted away.\nTo observers, this came as no\nsurprise. A saturated market and\nconsumers\u2019 increasing negativity\ntowardexpensiveplasticinstruments\nmade the downfall of the genre all\nbut inevitable.\nFrom its beginnings in 2005,\nGuitar Hero grew from a guitar\nbased rhythm game to a full band\nexperience. During this time Rock\nBand proved a formidable rival,\noffering a vast online catalogue\nof songs and a large variety of\ninstruments.\nHarmonix hoped to survive the\ndownturn with the release of Rock\nBand 3. Advertised as a platform to\npurchase music, they promised to\ncontinue supporting the title with\nnew content long into the future,\nbut, by 2013 the release of regular\nDLC was discontinued.\nOne of Activision\u2019s last attempts to\nrevitalise the franchise,in the release\nof DJ Hero, saw critical acclaim\nand also introduced the world to\nFreeStyleGames who would later\ngo on to develop Guitar Hero Live.\nOffering a wide selection of musical\ngenres and interesting gameplay\nmechanics, it proved that there\nwas space left in rhythm gaming to\ninnovate.\nFive years later and we\u2019re\nbeginning to see the future that it\npromised.\nGuitar Hero Live\u2019s announcement\nearlier this year surprised many\nwhen it was revealed that the game\nwould replace the series\u2019 semi-cartoonish 3D graphics with high\ndefinition FMVs (full motion\nvideo).\nToday, it\u2019s rare to see FMVs in\nsuch high profile games; they offer\nGuitar Hero Live allows you to test your skills in front of an adoring (or not so adoring) crowd. Photo Credit: Activision\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nOnly Imperial\u2019s supercomputer, Helen, could render graphics this good. Photo Credit: Activision\nlimited interactivity in a time when\nconsumers want deep and engaging\nworlds.\nFor rhythm games, the\nbackground has always been\nsecondary. In resurrecting the\nfranchise, FreeStyleGames could\nhave made the decision to render\nthe entire crowd at runtime, a task\nwhich modern consoles might\nhave struggled with. Instead, their\nuse of reactive FMVs has allowed\nthe studio to create highly realistic\ngraphics on a (probably) relatively\nsmall budget.\nIt perfectly emulates the\nexperience of being a musician and\nthe ability of the public to suddenly\nsatisfying. With the new button\nlayout, the developers were able to\nintroduce bar chords and other more\ncomplex combinations. The added\nchallenge might put off newcomers,\nbut it\u2019s easily the closest you\u2019ll get to\nplaying a real guitar with a plastic\ninstrument.\nTV mode is arguably the game\u2019s\nmost innovative feature. In the past,\nto unlock new content Guitar Hero\nand Rock Band required you to\npurchase music on their in-game\nstores.\nWith Live, you can tune into a 24\nhour streaming channel where you\u2019ll\nbe able to compete with other users\nin real-time. Two channels offer\ndifferent genre based shows (from\nIndie hits to Metal classics) with\nbrief intermissions that shamelessly\nimitate MTV.\nThe full catalogue of songs from\nboth channels is available at all\ntimes and if there\u2019s a song you want\nto play again you can pay (with real\nor in-game money).This new model\nof video game consumption reflects\nthe music industry\u2019s move away\nfrom ownership. Luckily, the vast\namount of replayability that comes\nwith it is well worth the sacrifice.\nWhile previous games only offered\nevolutionary changes, Guitar Hero\nLive is the first revolutionary release\nin the franchise. It\u2019s a rhythm game\nfor the Netflix generation, offering\nnearly unlimited content.\nGuitar Hero Live by\nFreeStyleGames is available now\nFreeStyleGames\u2019 latest rhythm game is addictive, immersive and refreshingly reactive\nIt perfectly\nemulates\nthe ability\nof the\npublic to\nsuddenly\nturn\non you\nturn on you. Reactive crowds boo,\nfrown and look generally miserable\nwhenever you\u2019re playing badly or\ncheer and hold up encouraging signs\nwhen you\u2019re on a note streak.\nFor a moment you feel like a\nrock star commanding an audience\nof thousands until you remember\nyou\u2019re just sitting in your living room\nin nothing but your boxers strutting\non a plastic guitar probably made\nin China. It\u2019s the most immersive\nGuitar Hero has ever been.\nThe new guitar peripheral replaces\nthe five frets of the past with two\nrows of three. At first, it\u2019s likely\nto hurt your brain, however, when\nit finally clicks it\u2019s incredibly\nIt\u2019s a rhythm\ngame for\nthe Netflix\ngeneration,\noffering\nnearly\nunlimited\ncontent\n\n"

Bah!\nBen Williams\nWriter\nGet off your high horse and stop thinking science is too good for art\nS\no here\u2019s my exhibition label.\nNeat card,kind of heavy.Flat\nblue type, rather charming:\n\u201cPHYSICIST MEETS\nART\u201d. \u201cSheesh\u201d,you say,\u201cI thought\nthey allowed children in these\nplaces.\u201d Luckily for you and I times\nhave changed. I\u2019ll tell you straight:\nthis love is not the sin against\nscience that they\u2019d have you believe.\nIt seems pretty simple to me. Art\nis the set of ideas that people can\ntry to express. Science is the set of\nthose ideas that we can test. Happy?\nGood. So all scientists are artists?\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d I hear you shout. Yet,\nthere is, from any logical, sane\nstandpoint no contradiction.\nYou see, art \u2013that whale of a\nword \u2013 isn\u2019t in the definition of the\nbrushstrokes of dead men. Pages\nsubconscious. The route it takes\nthere is pretty irrelevant.\nYet still, we have that stale old lie,\nlingering in the corners between the\nlibrary caf\u00e9\u2019s pigeon-chewed sofas\nand curling itself around my pint in\nthe union. \u201cScience\u201d, you will snarl,\npipe in hand,eyebrow talking \u201cis not\nart.\u201d\nSo say the wise and worldy\n\u2018practical people\u2019. You\u2019ll read this\nwhile poncing about and puff up like\nfat red bullfrogs: \u201cCroak! Where\u2019s\nme meat and three veg? Croak! This\nain\u2019t gonna pay no bills, buddy!\u201d\nNo,it ain\u2019t mate.But this repressed\n\u2018Mr Nuts and Bolts\u2019 attitude is\ncowardice \u2013 a dodge.It\u2019s a thick grey\nblobby wall, not a solution. That\nvoodoo statement is, nine times\nout of ten, as much about deluding\nourselves into applying a series of\nfake absolutes, as dealing with the\nworld as it is.\nComfortable, maybe, but I\u2019m still\nnaive enough to believe it\u2019s the truth\nthat we really care about. I mean,\nwhen you say this \u2018high\u2019 talk of art\nisn\u2019t real, what\u2019s your goddamm\n\u2018real\u2019? Vodka and beans?\nArt might not look like vodka\nand beans, sure, but then vodka and\nbeans look a hell of a lot like you,\ngiven the right perspective. Your\nvodka and beans are, in the history\nof the planet, quite a terrifying\nrevolution.That is an objective truth\n\u2013 or at least as much as any scientist\ncan ask for.\nLike it or not eyebrow wielder,\nwhat we\u2019re doing here isn\u2019t building\nsomekindofcutesy1950\u2019sbungalow.\nIt\u2019s not about walls. Einstein wasn\u2019t\na stay-at-home dad, and Noether\nisn\u2019t in the kitchen making meatloaf.\nThe beautiful, crazy thing that we\nfind is that there are almost no\nabsolutes. There are very, very, very\nfew things that we can know for\ncertain, if anything. That, painful as\nit may be, is absolutely beautiful in\nthe way we find the limits of what\nwe imagine, and what we can make\nare so blazingly close. Imperial was\nborn on challenge and change, and\nwe have a responsibility to see the\nworld as wooly and wild as it is, not\nfrom some shivering little Victorian\nfear of \u2018containment\u2019.\nThe terrifying thing about the\n\u2018grey blob\u2019 \u2013 the little voice that\nsays it\u2019s okay just to be another\ncalculating sausage, is that is breeds\ndeadbeat apathy.\nI mean it\u2019s common knowledge\nthat Imperial is a dead duck, right?\nWhy bother trying? Why bother\nfighting? We don\u2019t do \u2018change\u2019. We\ncan\u2019t compete. The college hates us\nall \u2013 yes, even you Mr Perfect \u2013 and\nE\nzra Pound\u2019s poetry is\npoised to rejuvenate the\nmodern reader due to his\nliteral sense of audience,\nappealing to \u201ca community of\nreaders and writers, existing across\ntime\u2026a trans-historical community\nof artists.\u201d(Prof. Langdon Hammer,\nYale University, 2012). It is this\ndelocalization that will allow his\npoems to endure. While at times\nhermetically difficult, steeped in\ncontemporary vernacular, their\nlanguage allows immediate access in\nits variety. One hesitates to advocate\nescapism, however much modern\ntimes may encourage it.\nYet, as Pound writes in \u2018The\nObject\u2019:\nThis thing, that hath a code and\nnot a core,\nHath set acquaintance where\nmight be affections,\nAnd nothing now\nDisturbeth his reflections.\nIn an era of gross consumerism,\nwhen the notion of duty and the\nvalue of obligation, tradition and\nlineage are a shadow of their former\nselves, poets of tradition (such as\nT.S Eliot) face castigation from\nmass readership. Pound\u2019s own\njourney from America to Europe,\nnow a century ago, was in itself the\nfleeing of cultural commodity. If\nthis anathema was woven into the\npoet\u2019s resolve, one might argue that\nit is manifest in the poetry, allowing\nit to endure.\nOne might posit that it is the\ndriving force behind Pound\u2019s poetic\n\u2018impulse\u2019, as demonstrated in \u2018The\nSeafarer\u2019:\nBitter-breast cares have I abided,\nKnown on my keel many a care\u2019s\nhand.\nAnd dire sea-surge, and there oft\nspent\nNarrow nightwatch night the\nship\u2019s head\nWhile she tossed close to cliffs.\nIn the early twentieth century, the\npoem was an avant garde mapping\nof the Anglo-Saxon vernacular\ninto modern English. Its rough\nmetre and daring use of plosive\ngive weight and life to its nautical\nimagery. In parodying the old\nEnglish alliterative verse, whereby\npoems are synchronized by stress\ncount rather than metric feet, the\nspeaker\u2019s voice is given vitality. It\nfulfills Pound\u2019s historical mission\nto \u201cmake it new\u201d (Hammer, 2012).\nIt has enough weight to be heard\namidst the modern trivial din.\nThe image of journey transcends\nthe oceans, becoming a \u2018crossing\nover\u2019 in time and space: a surrender.\nAnother strength of Pound\u2019s poetry\nis that it employs secular means to\nengender inspiration. While the\npoet was experimentalist, he was\nalso a pedantic scholar, his work\nbecome an option?\nNormally, I hate the kind of goof\nwho quotes Feynman (as quotes\ngo, he\u2019s the Physicists equivalent of\nAunty Ethel), but he puts down the\nchallenge pretty elegantly:\n\u201cFor far more marvelous is the truth\nthan any artists of the past imagined\nit. Why do the poets of the present\nnot speak of it? What men are poets\nwho can speak of Jupiter if he were\na man, but if he is an immense\nspinning sphere of methane and\nammonia must be silent?\u201d\nBut I\u2019d flip this. We are meant\nto keep the flame alive. College is\ntaking this super seriously \u2013 if you\u2019ve\nchecked out the temperature of the\ncomputing labs on howhotislabs.com\nrecently, you\u2019ll see we\u2019re well on the\nway to officially being \u2018on fire\u2019.\nOf course, it is the sad reality of\nthis stubborn world that not all\nof you will be hit by your artistic\nepiphany, but do me one favour:\nstop thinking of arts as a dirty\nword. The arts aren\u2019t some hidden,\nforbidden thing. As students, and\n\u201cScience\u201d,\nyou will\nsnarl, pipe\nin hand,\neyebrow\ntalking \u201cis\nnot art\u201d\nof black dots on dead trees is not a\nnovel.\nEqually, it\u2019d be idiotic to worship\nthe paper on which Einstein wrote\nthe first metric tensor, or to think of\nNewtonian mechanics as Newton\u2019s\nequations.These are much like a bra:\nthey provide support, but it\u2019s what\u2019s\ninside that counts.It is the idea itself\nthat matters, not the wrapping.\nThe point is that the measure of\nthe power of any kind of work (and\nI\u2019d call Dirac an artist, as much\nas Picasso) is fundamentally in\nthe conversation it can have \u2013 the\nperspective it can push into your\nImperial is a\ndead duck.\nWhy bother\ntrying?\nwe\u2019re screwed anyhow. Can we be\nproud of that kind of culture? Is\nthat really what we are here for?\nAnd seriously, at what point does\nducking and running no longer\nHere comes the revolution, save us science!

Akin to language,\nthe past spawns derivation: Pound\nmakes the past the present, made\n\u201ccontinuously available for those\nwho can recognize it\u2026technical\npowers\u2026achieve immediacy.\u201d\n(Hammer, 2012)\nI conclude by expressing my love\nof Pound\u2019s \u2018impulse\u2019, his kernel. In\na world of competition, where one\nThe Poetry of Ezra Pound\nAn Anchor for the Modern Reader\nEoghan Totten\nWriter\nwrites this very article on a whim at\neight o\u2019clock in the morning (close\nto a printing deadline and wedged\nbetween breakfast and class), where\nthere is little room for cohesion and\npoise in man\u2019s life, it is imperative\nthat he make room for the past.\nWhere value was conferred by and\ntransmitted in every breath, today,\nit is laughed at, scorned. For an\ninstant, pick up Pound, surrender\nyourself to phanopoeia, to language,\nto the immediacy of the past. It is\napt that Ezra Pound writes in \u2018La\nFraisne\u2019 that:\nI have put aside all folly and all\ngrief.\nI wrapped my tears in an ellum\nleaf\nAnd left them under a stone\nAnd now men call me mad\nbecause I have thrown\nAll folly from me,putting it aside\nTo leave the old barren ways of\nmen.\nEzra Pound.

Husbands and\nSons, an adaption of three of DH\nLawrence\u2019s lesser-known plays,\nengagingly depicts the persistent,\nmundane horror overshadowing\nthe lives of three mining families in\nearly 20th\ncentury Nottinghamshire.\nThe mines are an ever-present\nspectre, threatening the livelihoods\nand indeed lives of the miners.\nSoot infiltrates every aspect of\nfamily life.The parallels between the\nmen\u2019s claustrophobic entrapment\nin the pits and that of their\nwives in cramped kitchens are\nimmediately apparent. Conflict\nbetween husbands and wives, wives\nand mothers, fathers and sons is\nomnipresent. Thin walls transmit\nneighbours\u2019arguments,robbing even\ntemporarily reconciled households\nof peace. The innovative use of a\nminimalist set focuses attention\nupon this unfolding human\ndrama. The industrial revolution\u2019s\ndesolation of bucolic life is depicted\nwith an authenticity born of\nLawrence\u2019s personal experience.\nMisery emanates not only from\nthe mines, but also from frequently\ntoxic family dynamics.\nDistant, often brutish, husbands\nconflict with their seemingly\nindifferent wives. Mothers bereft\nof affection from their husbands\nseek to control the affections of\nsons seeking to form relationships\nwith wives of their own. Sons fight\nto escape their fathers\u2019 legacies,\nprojecting struggles against their\ninherited nature onto their parents.\nAll are isolated in the midst of a\ndensely packed community.\nWhile the tribulations of the first\nact induce a heavy and oppressive\natmosphere, the interpersonal\norigin of many of the characters\u2019\nproblems permits a redemption\nthat would remain out of reach\nshould they stem solely from\nthe seemingly inescapable coal\npits. In this Lawrence offers the\naudience a thin ray of light amidst\nthe darkness. Husbands and Sons is\nboth an authentic period piece and\nHusbands and Sons\nBill Gewanter\nWriter\nMothers, marraiges and mines oppress and inspire in gripping production at the National\ninstantly relatable to the present\nday. With the recent closure of\nTata\u2019s steel plants, the social impact\nof the decline of heavy industry\nhas once again been brought into\nsharp focus. Lawrence refrains from\nromanticism in his depiction of the\nlives of mining communities, but in\nportraying the humour, camaraderie\nand resilience of these unbowed\nhusbands, wives, mothers and sons\nhe reveals a telling dichotomy. The\nclosure of the pits ended the danger\nfaced on a daily basis by the miners,\nbut also decimated communities\nwith distinct identities and a\nsolidarity born of resisting forces\nbeyond their control.\nA universally strong cast makes\nHusbands and Sons a thoroughly\nimmersive experience. The events\nof the play are seen through the\neyes of its female characters. In\na stand out performance, Anne\nMarie-Duff\u2019s heart-breaking\nconflict between duty to her family\nand to herself culminates in a\ndramatic crux that sheds light on\nher inability to escape her situation.\nLouise Brearley is entirely\nconvincing as a beautiful and loving\nwife trapped in a vicious cycle of\nrecrimination that threatens to\ndrive a progressively greater wedge\nbetween her and her husband.\nBoth express their affection for the\nother, but never to the other. The\nisolation and emotional repression\nhinted at through innumerable\nsubtleties in her performance\ncommunicates her inner turmoil\nwithout uttering a single word.\nJust as the mines remain constantly\npresent in the characters\u2019 lives, even\nafter they have washed themselves\nclean of soot, the struggles and\nresilience of Lawrence\u2019s characters\nwill remain with the audience\nlong after the final curtain.\nUntil February 10th\nat the National\nTheatre\u2019s Dorfman Stage\nTickets from \u00a315\nHusbands and Sons Photo Credit: National Theatre\nOh your crimson heart,\nwhich bleeds its throbbing red,\ninto the cavity of an aching chest,\nand in doing so\nrevives an old ennui,\nwhich heaves and splutters\ncoughing up the congestions of a past pernicious;\narteries bulge with viscous stuff,\nveins tear and capillaries explode,\nand in a cacophony of silence the insides implode,\na great statue felled by compunction\nits uneven foundations now clear to see,\na rubble of human belonging.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Ezra Kitson\nEscher: Psychedelic Mathematics, Scientific Art\nT\nhe paradoxical works\nof MC Escher were\nparadoxically admired\nboth by intellectuals for\ntheir mathematical accuracy, and\nby Pop culture\u2019s hippie movement\nfor their otherworldly creations.\nThe Amazing World of MC Escher at\nDulwich Picture Gallery thoroughly\nexplores the whole body of Escher\u2019s\nworks and through this exploration\nprovides a portrait of the incredible,\npeculiar, and enigmatic persona of\nEscher himself.\nThis exhibition gives the audience\nnot only the opportunity to\nadmire Escher\u2019s most famed and\ncharacteristic works in the flesh,\nbut also to discover his early, less-known works.\nElizaveta Tchebaniouk\nWriter\nThe chorological arrangement\nof the works allows the audience\nexperience Escher\u2019s personal journey\nand artistic transition from realistic\nlandscapes to multiple perspective\nworlds of his own creation. It\nis curious to see the varieties of\ninfluences and techniques Escher\ntried out before finding his niche,\nand moreover even when he had\nfound his artistic vision, he never\nstopped perfecting, reworking his\nart, continuously exploring different\ntechniques, methods, and subjects\nthroughout all of his career and well\ninto his late works.\nThe early works of Escher in the\nfirst rooms of the gallery are mostly\nlandscapes and realistic subjects\nsuch as portraits, but even these\nalready show Escher\u2019s interest in\npeculiar and slightly augmented\nperspectives and an attention to\nminute detail. The audience then\nexperiences Escher\u2019s transition to\ninventing his subjects and images.\nThe second room shows what\nEscher called the start of his\n\u2018Mental Imagery period\u2019 \u2013 the first\nworks where he combines two-dimentional and three-dimentional\nimages in one plane, as well as\nthe first of his famous double and\nreflected imagery (as seen in Hand\nwith Reflecting Sphere displayed in\nthis room).This is also when Escher\nbegins producing tessellation prints,\nlike Metamorphosis 1 where a 3D\ntown transforms into a 2D figure,\nor Day and Night where black and\nwhite birds fly out from the middle\nof the plane with the black birds\nemerging from the spaces between\nthe white birds and vice versa.\nFollowing this period is one where\nEscher moves away from tessellation\nprints to concentrate on paradoxes\ndemonstrating the illusion of art.\nEscher was a perfectionist \u2013 he\nwould make several studies and\nsketches, and would even rework\na print numerous times. Several\nof Escher\u2019s studies and sketches\nfor his famous works are also\nexhibited, showing his meticulous\ncreative process which was not a\nspontaneous art, but a methodical\nscience. His attention to detail\nallowed him to create completely\nirrational and impossible and yet\nperfectly fluid and coherent worlds\nin his prints, worlds where different\nperspectives and different points\nof gravity ran into each other so\nnaturally that it isn\u2019t apparent that\nthey are contradictory.\nThis continuous theme of the\nreal and reflected, the harmonious\ninterplay of art and illusion and a\nnew reality run throughout all of\nEscher\u2019sworks,andhisuniqueability\nto create these new coherent worlds\nmade him popular in the 1950\u2019s\nthroughout Europe and America,\nand his fans ranged from intellectual\ngroups of mathematicians to pop\nculture legends. Seeing the full body\nof Escher\u2019s extensive works in this\nexhibition, it is clear that Escher\u2019s\nfame was not due to a cultural\nmovement or a phenomenon of luck,\nbut solely due to the recognition\nand appreciation of his hard work\nand true genius.\nEscher, however, shunned fame\nand only strived to find peace and\nquiet to concentrate on his work,\nwhich is probably why, although\nmost people have seen his works\nin numerous places, they are not as\nM.C. Escher, Hand with Reflecting Sphere (Self-Portait in Spherical Mirror).\nPhoto Credit: The M.C. Escher Company-The Netherlands.\nfamiliar with the name behind the\nworks, as they may be with Picasso\nor Dali or Monet.\nThrough his meticulous process\nand finished works, it seems that\nEscher aimed to find order in a\nworld of chaos. For him, \u201corder was\nthe conclusion\u201d as he said, referring\nto Contrast (Order and Chaos), one\nof his late works. This notion helps\nus to understand Escher\u2019s works\nfrom a personal point of view.\nThere is a striking late work in\nthe last gallery, Liberation, where\na pattern of 2D birds transforms\ninto 3D birds at the top, flying off\nto freedom. This work is almost a\nmetaphor for Escher\u2019s own personal\nliberation from his struggles amidst\nlife\u2019s chaos, achieved only through\nthe perfect order of patterns he\ncreated himself.\nThough the artist and his art\nremain enigmas, it is all the\nmore captivating to explore\nthe possibilities of Escher\u2019s\nunconventionally beautiful and\neccentric works in the Dulwich\nPicture Gallery.\nThe Amazing World of MC Escher\nis at the Dulwich Picture Gallery\nuntil 17th\nJanuary 2016.\n\u00a37.50 concessions.\nM.C.

Chances are you\nlove Pixar. too. In all honesty,\nI\u2019d hazard a guess that the\nvast majority of sane people\non earth love them. Their films are\niconic and have set the precedent for\nanimated films that both children,\nadolescents and their parents can\nenjoy. But instead of watching\nFinding Nemo for the eleventh time,\nwhy not give some other storytellers\na chance to wow you?\nSong of the Sea (2014)\nReleased first in Ireland and\nEngland only earlier this year,\nSong of the Sea describes the epic\nadventure of Ben and his younger\nsister Saoirse, whose newly-found\nmagical gift means that she must\nfirst find her voice in order to save\nthe spirit world. Brimming with\nluscious visuals, mature storytelling,\nand Celtic charm, this film is quite\npossibly my favourite of the year.\nKiki\u2019s Delivery Service (1989)\nOften described as a \u2018Japanese\nWalt Disney\u2019 \u2013 a title he hates \u2013\nHayao Miyazaki (for obsessives\nsuch as me) is a man against which\nno other animator can compare\n(yes, he\u2019s better than John Lassiter\nor Chuck Jones). Kiki\u2019s Delivery\nService stands alongside Ponyo\nand My Neighbour Totoro as one\nof Miyazaki\u2019s more child-friendly\ncontributions, perfectly telling a\ncoming-of-age tale about the life\nand times of Kiki, a young witch\nwho must adapt to a new life in the\ncity.\nHelp! I\u2019m a Fish (2000)\nOkay, hear me out guys. Yes, it\u2019s\na terrible title; yes, its subtitle is \u2018a\npotion put them in the ocean\u2019; yes,\nit has a 5.8 on iMDB. Just know\nthat it\u2019s not me who\u2019s wrong \u2013 it\u2019s\neveryone else. This film tells the\nstory of a group of friends with\nonly 48 hours to find an antidote\nto the potion which turned them\nall into fish. It is is genuinely funny,\nwonderfully Don Bluth-esque, and\neven features Alan Rickman singing\na weird pop ballad \u2013 what\u2019s not to\nlike?\nBEN COLLIER\nJafar Panahi is the\nIranian neo-realist\nSince his 2011 arrest, Iranian director Jafar\nPanahi\u2019s fimmaking has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\nin the cinema world. We take a look at his life,\nhis work, and the events leading up to his ban on\nproducing films.\nA\n1995 Prix de La Cam\u00e9ra\nd\u2019Or-winning debut\nfilm; at the forefront of\nthe Iranian New Wave\nmovement; imprisoned for breaking\ncensorship laws and under house\narrest since October 15, 2011. Jafar\nPanahi has a repertoire few can\nmatch.\nPanahi is an Iranian director\nwho rose to fame with his 1995\nfilm The White Balloon. The film,\npraised by critics worldwide, won\nthe Prix de La Cam\u00e9ra d\u2019Or at that\nyear\u2019s Cannes Film Festival and\nguaranteed Panahi a spot among\nthe greats. It follows a stubborn\nseven-year-old girl\u2019s journey to get\na \u2018chubby\u2019 goldfish for the local\nNew Year celebrations. Shot with\na largely non-professional cast and\non location, the film explores the\nstruggles of the working class in\nIran through the pedestrian goal\nof obtaining the goldfish. One can\nimmediately see the influence of\nItalian neo-realism \u2013 the genre\nof which the Iranian New Wave\nmovement is most reminiscent.\nThe masterful use of a hand-held\ncamera, frequent close-ups of the\ncharacters, and the overall style\nof shooting that largely mimick a\ndocumentary only add to this list of\nsimilarities.\nWith Panahi\u2019s films, however, we\nare introduced to the stringent rules,\npractices, and general life in Iran\u2019s\ncapital city, Tehran, where all of his\nwork is based. They largely lack the\n\u2018male gaze\u2019, and frequently feature\nchild protagonists (for reasons\nlater explained) \u2013 both significant\ncharacteristics in the Iranian New\nWave movement. His subsequent\nfilms including The Mirror (1997),\nThe Circle (2000) and Offside\n(2006), all of which feature female\nprotagonists, allow us to view their\nlimited world and the struggles\nthey face. An important exception\nto this rule would be Crimson Gold\n(2003), a film \u2013 winner of the Un\nCertain Regard prize at Cannes \u2013\nthat follows the humiliation of a\npizza delivery man that eventually\nleads to his insanity. The central\ncharacter is both a delivery man and\na paranoid schizophrenic in real life\nwho did not see the completed film.\nWhile Panahi maintains he is a\nperson interested in social issues\nrather than politics, he does admit\nthey have the tendency to blur. It is\nthe widespread interest in his films\nthat has led to Crimson Gold, like\nmost of his other films,being banned\nfrom screening in Iran. Censorship\nlaws in the country are strict when\nit comes to what can be shown to\nthe public, consisting of a number\nof rules laid down in the late 1990\u2019s\nincluding a ban on men and women\nsitting close together, men and\nwomen exchanging \u201ctender words\nor jokes\u201d, booze or profanity against\nreligion, and neckties (they are\nviewed as a symbol of foreign culture\nthat therefore spreads Western\npropaganda). These stringent\nlaws are why Panahi started with\nchildren\u2019s films. He later explained\nthat \u201cmaking children\u2019s films was a\nway of saying what we wanted to\nsay in adult films\u201d.\nWith his later films, however,\nPanahi has gotten more daring.\nSince The Circle, all of his\nfilms were banned before their\ninternational release or were\nmade illegally and then smuggled\noutside Iran. Famously, a flash\ndrive containing his 2011 work\nThis Is Not A Film was smuggled\nfrom Iran inside a cake, to be\nlater screened at the Cannes\nFilm Festival. Unfortuntely, it has\nnot all been finding clever ways\nto avoid the censors and come\nout unscathed; Panahi has been\narrested and imprisoned on several\noccasions on account of his films,\nwhich the Iranian government\nfeels oppose its current regime.\nThe first of a long string of arrests\nrelated to his filmmaking that led\nup to his house arrest in 2011 was\nin 2003 \u2013 the same year Crimson\nGold was released.After having been\narrested,Panahi was interrogated for\nhours by the Information Ministry\nin Iran, who asked him, \u201cwhy don\u2019t\nyou just leave this country and work\noutside of Iran, given that the core\nof your supporters live there?\u201d As a\nmatter of principle, however, Panahi\nstill resides in his home country.\nOn the 20th\nDecember 2010, he\nwas sentenced to 6 years in prison,\nbanned from involvement in films\nfor 20 years, and forbidden to leave\nIran. Most recently, on October 15th\n2011, he was placed under house\narrest \u2013 although he has has since\nbeen allowed to travel around Iran.\nWhen asked whether the cinematic\nvalue of his films lies in their\nconfrontation with the censorship\nregime, Panahi replied, \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s a value the film has, but\nit\u2019s a value I have. I become the\nperson who refuses to compromise;\nI become the person whose identity\nis defined by my rebellion against\nthe censorship regime. I do enjoy\nthat status of being the person who\nis resisting this force.\u201d\nUnable to leave Iran since 2011,\nall of Panahi\u2019s films since then were\nmade illegally. There\u2019s also the issue\nthat, as Xan Brookes puts very\nsuccinctly, Panahi is in a situation\nwherein he is \u201c...making Iranian\nfilms about Iranian life that Iranians\nare forbidden to see.\u201d Having the\ntarget audience for his films taken\naway, Panahi disappointedly states\nthat the government has left him\n\u201cdeprived of the ability to have my\nwork influence people where it\ncan have most effect.\u201d Despite this,\nPanahi remains optimistic: \u201cIf a film\nis successful, it will be saved\u201d, he has\nsaid. At this point in time, he sees\neach of his films as a \u201cdocument of\nwhat life was like at the time\u201d. He\nsays about the future, \u201cOne of two\nthings can happen: maybe times\nwill have changed, and they\u2019re a\ndocument that serves as a warning\nnot to go back to this dark age, or\nthings haven\u2019t changed, and they\u2019re\na warning about how prolonged it\nhas become, this problem.\u201d And\nso Panahi continues to do exactly\nthat: he documents the daily life of\nIranians in Tehran.\nIn his most recent film, Taxi\nTehran (2015), out in the UK\nnow, Panahi continues to fight his\nbattle with the Iranian censorship\nregime. The film was made illegally\nby installing three hidden cameras\ninside a taxi, offering its viewers a\njourney with the locals of Tehran\nand bringing forward more social\nconcerns though the questioning of\nthe passengers by the driver, Panahi\nhimself.The film has already won the\nGolden Bear and the FIPRESCI at\nthe 65th\nBerlin International Film\nFestival, continuing the tradition\nof his films being celebrated\ninternationally but shunned in his\nown country. Panahi\u2019s resilience\nthrough these difficult ordeals,\ntrapped inside a world he\u2019s working\nto change, and working around the\nnumerous strict limitations he faces,\nis commendable. The international\nsupport he has been receiving during\nthese years has been extraordinary;\nan international support network\nhas been set up that includes\norganisations such as Amnesty\nInternational, A-list names such as\nScorsese and Spielberg,and national\ngovernments of several Western\ncountries. In March 2011, Barack\nObama cited Panahi\u2019s persecution\nas an example of the oppressive\nIranian regime, and in April 2011,\nTime Magazine named Panahi\nnumber three in their list of the Top\nTen Persecuted Artists who have\nchallenged authority. It is with this\nglobal support that Panahi is aware\nof the quiet protection he possesses,\nprotection that gives him confidence\nto try and fix things from the inside,\nmost definitely a long and tedious\ntask. But, as he once said, \u201cThe\nsystem can\u2019t last forever, I can wait.\u201d\nMERYL ANIL\nJafar Panahi\nhas the\nconfidence\nto try and fix\nthings from\ninside Iran:\na long and\ntedious task\nAida Mohammadkhani as Razieh in Jafar Panahi\u2019s debut film The White Balloon.

But ignorance does nothing\nfor those being evacuated in war-ships, choking under a thick ochre\nblanket, and the species burning at\nthe hands of human greed.\n5,000km of the continent is up\nin flames, so why are we reading\nheadlines such as \u201cCancer causing\nSausage Baps?\u201d We are looking at\nthe wrong BBQ.\nIndonesia is a monopolist of the\npalm oil industry; with acres and\nacres of the land scared, stripped\nbare of its natural forestry, turning\nit into products such as Colgate\nand peanut butter. The industry has\nprovided employment, producing\nthe most productive form of oil.\nBut it has also broken bonds in\na complex natural system that\npreviously harvested the greatest\nquantity of the world\u2019s biodiversity.\nNow, only two species dominate:\nthe oil palm and humans.\nBut like the ticking metronomes\nof the machines working the land,\ntime is an adversary to this industry.\nYes, it is an industry which supports\nthis developing country financially.\nAs such, Indonesia\u2019s government\nhas prohibited restraints of some\nThe often month-long fires burning Indonesia\u2019s peat deposits create massive smoke blankets.

So now you\ncan see where sugars start forming,\nas well as more complex organics\nsuch as amino acids -- the building\nblocks of proteins -- or nucleobases,\nthe building blocks of DNA.

But\ndespite enjoying it,I came out of the\ncinema with a slightly bitter taste in\nmy mouth.\nThe writers, directors, and\nproducers of the modern, Daniel\nCraig incarnations of James Bond\nhave obviously tried to make their\nfilms progressive, and to bring them\nin line with the modern world. And\nfor the most part, they\u2019ve succeeded.\nMoneypenny is now a young, hot,\nblack woman with a life outside\nMI6, and Q is an Imperial-worthy\ngeek who always ends up saving\nthe day by hacking some computer\nsystem.\nWithin the genre of a renegade\nspy who somehow faces no\nconsequences for disobeying orders\nand can make himself invisible\nto all intelligence agencies just by\ndriving a highly conspicuous car\nacross Europe, the film does a pretty\ndecent job of re-styling it for the\nmodern era. But where it fails is in\nits portrayal of women.\nFemale characters appear, and\noften start off being presented as\nstrong, well-rounded, independent\nwomen who don\u2019t want or need\nany help from James Bond. But\ninvariably, three scenes later, the\nsexual tension has built (or appears\nout of nowhere in a rather contrived\nway) and we see them tumble into\nbed, followed by some fight scene\nwhere he displays his apparently\nirresistible masculinity.\nThat\u2019s fine, he\u2019s hot, it\u2019s a sexy\nsituation, I get it. But after sleeping\nwith him, these female characters\nseem devoid of any personality and\nmerely follow him around like a\nhelpless puppy,occasionally needing\nsaving.What is it about James Bond\nthat does this? Does he have some\nkind of sexually transmitted disease\nthat only affects women, attacking\ntheir frontal lobes?\nDoes James\nBond have\nsome sort\nof sexually\ntransmitted\ndisease that\nonly affects\nwomen?\nThese days, it\u2019s not appropriate\nto reduce women from supporting\ncharacters to decoration after they\nhave been explicitly sexualised.\nWriting these characters as\nsubservient, helpless and timid after\nthey have served their duty being a\npiece of ass is no longer acceptable.\nEvery other aspect of the film has\nbeen carefully scrutinised and\nupdated to make it realistic and\nrelevant for today, but by leaving in\nthis dated portrayal of women, the\nwriters are demonstrating a latent\nsexist attitude. They are showing\nthat they only consider women\u2019s\npersonalities to be a means of\njustifying their being interesting\nenough for Bond to shag them, not\nworth bothering with once he\u2019s got\nhis leg over.\nMany people will speak in defence\nof this, arguing that Bond being a\nwomaniser is an important part of\nthe genre, and to some extent, I\nagree. I have no problem with James\nBond having sex with as many of\nthe female (or male) characters as\nhe desires. But sleeping with James\nBond and being a powerful female\ncharacter are not mutually exclusive,\nand I think that it is time that the\nproducers address their misogynistic\nattitudes and truly bring James\nBond into the modern era.\nPoppies are not a source of pride\nBy wearing a poppy, all you are showing is that you can conform to what is expected\nSimran Kukram\nWriter\nW\nednesday 11th\nNovember marks\n97 years since the\narmistice of the\nFirst World War. Across the UK,\nthe poppy will be worn this month\nas a symbol of commemoration\nfor all the lives lost and affected by\nconflict.\nEvery year the appeal is criticised\nfor seeming to glorify war: the\nparade by the Royal British Legion\ncan be seen to present wars as a\njustifiable necessity full of grandeur\nand pride \u2013 a bloody means to an\nend. The Festival of Remembrance\ntakes place over the weekend at\nthe Royal Albert Hall, including\npoppy-adorned performances by\nPixie Lott and Rod Stewart.\nAnother criticism is that poppies\nhave lost their meaning. The\nexpectation for them to be worn\nin public is so strong that there\nwere complaints when Channel 4\npresenter, Jon Snow, chose not to\nwear one on air. Poppies are flown\nout to correspondents all over the\nworld so that no news screen should\nlack the red paper badge.This week,\nthe Conservative party was mocked\nfor photoshopping a poppy onto\nDavid Cameron\u2019s lapel for his new\nFacebook profile picture. If they\nhave become such a requirement\nthis time of year that photos must\nbe corrected to display them, do\nthey mean anything but conforming\nto what is expected? What do they\nmean besides a reflection of the\ncalendar month? Nothing but a\ndeferential \u201crespect our troops\u201d?\nFor me,poppies are a symbol of the\nharsh realities of war.The jarring red\nsymbolises the blood of those on any\n\u201cside\u201d that died, and are still dying\nin combat. The money raised by the\npoppy appeal goes to support past\nand present soldiers and their loved\nones, whose wounds are mental as\nwell as physical. For those affected\nby war, I think the respectful thing\nto do is to take a step back, and have\na moment of silence to acknowledge\nthe atrocities experienced by fellow\nhuman beings. The poppy reminds\nus that the real cost of war is not\npaid by nations, but by ordinary\nindividuals.It is not about glorifying\nany \u201cvictory\u201d, but about the loss\nthat happened, and is happening.\nIt is important to remember so that\nwe can make a conscious effort to\nsupport those who are subjected\nto such horrors. The poppy is a\nsobering, not beautiful sight.\nI will be wearing a poppy, but I\nwon\u2019t be wearing it with pride.\nHave poppies lost their meaning?

But, if your home\ncountry is in a state of change and\nturmoil, the hardest thing about\nbeing away is having to live through\ncertain events merely through the\nnews,brought to you predominantly\nby social media.\nThis article is not about the politics\nbehind Turkey\u2019s turmoil, but rather\nit is about the sentimental side of\nhaving to experience this turmoil\nfrom a distance.\nTwo and a half years ago I was\nglued to my computer screen in the\nlibrary, clicking on link after link\non Facebook, watching the Gezi\nPark demonstrations in Istanbul.\nAs I watched the videos of the\nTurkish police trying to overpower\nthe citizens through the brutal use\nof water cannons and tear gas I felt\ndevastated, furious, and worst of all,\nhelpless.\nThree weeks ago I woke up to my\nFacebook news feed telling me that\ntwo bombs had gone off in my home\ncity \u2013 Ankara,the capital ofTurkey.I\ninstantly called my parents to check\non my family, and words cannot\nexpress the emotions I experienced\nas I waited for them to pick up. My\nfamily and friends were okay, but\nthroughout the day I watched the\nnumber of families who weren\u2019t as\nlucky rise to over 130.\nSunday marked the second time\nin five months that Turkey had\nparliamentary elections; the first\none, in June, was inconclusive, as\nthe rival parties could not agree on\nforming a coalition.\nI was at my desk working,with my\ncomputer screen locked on a live feed\nof the election results. Watching the\nresults without family and friends\nwas a whole new experience \u2013\nwithout the heated discussions and\nYou\u2019d\nthink that\nanything that\nsignificantly\nraises\ncancer risk\nwould be a\nconcern\neducated speculations about what\nthe results would bring for Turkey\u2019s\nfuture, the vote counts felt nothing\nmore than meaningless numbers.\nNow, it seems that I will have\nmany more sleepless nights as\nTurkey\u2019s instability continues, and I\npursue my life abroad.Yet,I am only\none of many international students\nhaving to helplessly watch our\nhome country\u2019s fate from across the\nworld. Some people can distance\nthemselves from the sentiments\nbrought on by such events. Others\nhave different coping mechanisms,\nbe it reading every post on social\nmedia, or incessantly telling friends\nwhat their perspective is on the\npolitics behind the events.\nTo end with the words of Mustafa\nKemal Ataturk, the founder of the\nRepublic of Turkey, \u201cPeace at home,\nPeace in the World.\u201d And so I hope\nthat one day in the future I can say\nthat Turkey too has joined some of\nthe few countries in the world to\nhave found (relative) peace.\nShould we accept that bacon gives us cancer?\nThe writing is on the wall when it comes to the\nbenefits of vegetarianism\nBen Sharpless\nWriter\nF\nirst you find out you\u2019re not\nactually eating beef, nay,\nhorses. Then you find out\nit causes cancer too. Hard\ntimes to be a meat eater.\nIt has been in the news that the\nWHO have produced a report\ntelling us that meat causes cancer.\nOr rather, they have classified\ncertain types of meat as a Group 1\ncarcinogen.\nHeadlines such as, \u201cMeat as big\na cause of cancer as cigarettes\u201d and\n\u201cMeat as bad as tobacco\u201d, however,\nare the media getting up to its clever,\nsensationalist, attention-grabbing\ntricks. The headlines stem from\nthe fact that processed meats have\nbeen put into the same carcinogen\ncategory as tobacco. But whereas\ntobacco raises the relative risk of\ncancer by about 250%, eating two\nslices of bacon a day only raises your\nrelative risk by 18%. So it isn\u2019t quite\nas bad as the papers would have us\nbelieve.\nBut what still baffles me is people\u2019s\nattitude toward the study. Instead of\nconcern, people seem to scoff at it,\nas if the idea that meat is that bad\nfor their health is ridiculous. Why\nis that? You\u2019d think that anything\nthat significantly raises cancer risk\nwould be a concern, but there seems\nto be a prejudice against anything\nthat challenges eating meat in the\ngeneral population.\nIt might be that people\u2019s attitudes\ntowards vegetarianism and meat\nare rooted in old ways of thinking,\nwhere finishing a steak was the\nmark of a man. Personally, there\nhave been many times that people\nhave made a remark that I\u2019m less\nmanly for not eating meat. I\u2019ve also\nheard that I \u201cjust graze in a field\u201d\nwhen I\u2019m hungry.\nVegetarians are often criticised for\nnot eating meat, even though the\nperson criticising is not affected by\ntheir decision in any way.\nIf a study was released saying that\nfruit significantly increased the risk\nof cancer, would people take more\nnotice?\nUntil the early-mid twentieth\ncentury, smoking was seen as less of\na taboo. Some people even believed\nthat tobacco was good for them\n(because of the propaganda of the\ntobacco industry). But smoking has\ndeclined drastically since then, due\nto large shifts in the public views of\nthe way tobacco affects health, and\nin particular causes cancer.\nThe health merits of a vegetarian\ndiet have been extensively\ndocumented, and the writing has\nbeen on the wall for a long time\nin terms of meat\u2019s carcinogen\ncapacity. So, is it time for people to\nget over their meat prejudices and\nstart looking at how it affects their\nhealth, in the same way they look at\ntobacco? Probably not \u2013 I think the\nstudy will be forgotten about pretty\nquickly.\nWe watch the events unfold, powerless to help. Photo Credit: balkanist.net\n\n"
