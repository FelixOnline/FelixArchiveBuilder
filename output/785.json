    "content": "ers CP \u2022\nVATnot\nforgotten\nDear Judith,\nWith reference to the letter that you printed last week\nunder the heading 'Slave Labour', you might like to note .\nthat all Summer Lettings Managers, except one, received\nbonuses of between 86% and 90% of the possible\nmaximum. They also received a wage of \u00a3100 per week.\nand free accommodation throughout the Summer Vacation.\nThe letter reiterated the suggestion that VAT on rents\nhad been miscalculated. This is not true. When the prices\nwere set it was decided that short stays should be charged\nat a higher rate in recognition of greater overheads and\nto increase income. Rents for the first four weeks of each\nstay were increased by between 5.7% and 8.3% while,\nrents for subsequent weeks were increased by between\n3.8% and 5.5%.\nVAT is chargeable at 15% for the first four weeks and\n3 % for subsequent weeks. The difference in the inclusive\nrate charged for the first four weeks and that for subsequent\nweeks might be thought to be wholly attributable to the\ndifferent VAT rates. Clearly as a higher rate was being\ncharged for short stays, regardless of VAT, this wasn't, the case. Nevertheless, one of the Summer Lettings.\nManagers did the following calculation:\nFor example: Evelyn Gardens single rooms (inclusive,\nof VAT)\nFirst 4 weeks \u00a345 per week. Subsequent weeks \u00a339 .\nRent net of 15 % VAT based on \u00a345 per week = \u00a339.13.\nIf the difference really had been attributable to VAT.\nalone, then the rent for the subsequent weeks should have\nbeen \u00a339.13 +3% VAT. It was therefore assumed that,\nthere had been a miscalculation.\nOf course, the calculation should have been:\n\u00a345 net of 1\n5\n% VAT = \u00a339.13\n\u00a339 net of 3\n% VAT = \u00a337.86\nTherefore the residence account benefits by \u00a31.27 per.\nbed per week on short stays. Since we are letting over.\n700 beds throughout the summer vacation, this adds up.\nto a useful contribution to our efforts to keep down term.\ntime rents.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Arthur, Assistant Secretary.\nBetter\ndriving?\nDear Judith,\nDaren Austin's article on better driving (FELIX 784),\nwhile discussing the appalling standard of driving on\nBritain's roads today, fails to mention the two underlying\nproblems:\n1. Why isn't the 'ordinary' driving test more thorough\nin its examination of learner drivers? It is scandalous that\nwithin minutes of passing the test a driver can, without,\nany experience, join a motorway where other vehicles are\ntravelling at speeds in excess of twice that which the new\ndriver is used to. Learner drivers also need to be taught\nthe principles involved in driving in adverse weather\nconditions such as fog, ice and snow\u2014and even night-.\ndriving techniques. (How many people know the correct\nway to drive in icy conditions ie no sudden steering-wheel\nmovements\u2014to avoid wheel spins ?...).\n2. Why must the legal age of driving be as low as 17?\nWhy not 21 or 25? It is a sad fact that the under-21 age\ngroup is the most likely to have accidents which results\nin scandalously high premiums for motor insurance.\n(Example: Last year I was forced to pay \u00a3520 to insure\na \u00a3600 car\u2014and I have a clean driving licence).\nThis begs the question: Why should a17 year old need\na driving licence? '\nYours,\nJohn Berkenhead, Maths 2.\nBigotry of\nWLC\nDear Judith,\nI'd like to comment on an appalling piece of bigotry\nwritten by Dave Thomas in Chi Rho last week.\nThe article I'm referring to is entitled 'Is Gay OK? Let's Bash Gays' and reflects the personal opinion of someone\nin the supposedly peace loving West London Chaplaincy.\nThere has been a lot of spiritual waffle in FELIX\nrecently, most of it disgustingly patronising, but that can\nonly be expected. However the very title of this article\nis provocative and I think it offends not only gay people\nat IC.\nHomosexuals are referred to as 'sinners' throughout the\narticle, he constantly speaks down to us as if we are the\npits of mankind.\nWell I should like to inform Mr Thomas that we don't want his sympathy or help and the day we accept it will\nbe the day we lose our last piece of self-integrity.\nFurthermore I think the few of us who have come out at\nIC really don't want to 'repent our sins, be released from\nhomosexuality and become normal, heterosexual people'.\nI wouldn't try to tell Dave Thomas that through careful,\nconsistent screwing of men, he could be released from\nhis Christianity to become a normal gay person!\nIncidentally the same rag recently suggested that people\nchoose to be gay. This is another half-baked load of\nrubbish and if I could choose I wouldn't want it any other\nway. Indeed discovering you're gay is not an easy thing\nto come to terms with, and with the present social\nprejudices that exist, I can't see that one would choose\nthe most difficult option.\nPersonally I don't mind people having religious views\u2014\neveryone's entitled to believe in their own set of fairy tales\nif they wish. However how dare they try to tell people\nwho are different from them that they are destined to the\nmost horrible end if they don't repent.\nThe pomposity and double standards of the Christian\nchurch is quite remarkable on this subject.\nHere's a few points that are no dafter than the rubbish\nyou're trying to convince the rest of us of: Was there\nsomething odd about Joseph? He was married to Mary\nfor several years and she was still a virgin when\nimpregnated by an angel she wasn't even married to. Jesus\nhung around with 12 blok es all his life and never took\nan interest in women. Why is God always portrayed as\na white heterosexual male shape with a beard? She might\nbe a black lesbian!\nFinally, has Mr Thomas noticed that the Sun recently\ntreated us to the case of the 'gay sex-change monk'\u2014\nwhat a lot of sin for you to condemn there.\nAl Roberts, DOC 2.\nSmall Ads ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022 Anyone expecting their Hall fees to\nbe paid by RAFC Cranwell\u2014please call\ninto room 403a Sherfield.

    "content": "FELIX VlkHVim\nYesterday evening (Wednesday) the\nPrint Unit suffered another set-back\nin a long line of machine failures and\nbreakages. The operating handle on\nour printing press sheared off. This\nis not bad going for a machine which\nis just over a year old and made by\na company with a reputation for\nreliable lithos. We could have got\ndepressed, but we didn't. Most of this\nissue has been printed by an outside\ncontractor and you are reading this\nissue because of an enormous amount\nof hard work put in by the FELIX\nstaff to get it ready in time to send it\nout. I would like to take this\nopportunity to thank all of them for\ntheir help and encouragement,\nespecially Chris Martin, Dominic\nStrowbridge, Bill Goodwin and\nMole(!) who stayed up on Wednesday\nnight to finish off pages.\nSt Mary's Many of you will already have heard\nthat Imperial College will become the\n\u2022Imperial College of Science,\nTechnology and Medicine in August\n1988 when we merge with St Mary's Hospital Medical School. We are\npleased to announce that St Mary's is\nnow receiving a limited edition of\nFELIX each week. If anybody who\nis reading this and going to St Mary's would like to work on FELIX,\nperhaps as St Mary's correspondent,\nthen get in touch with me on 01-589\n5111 ext 3515.\nIan Howgate\nWithin these pages is an opinion\narticle on FELIX and the possibility\nof it being biased against Ian\nHowgate. I hope you will not find it incestuous that FELLX prints criticism\nabout itself. Ifindit extremely useful\nto read and learn by such criticism.\nWhile I acknowledge that some of\nwhat has been said is true, I cannot\nagree with the sentiment.\nFirstly, FELIX is provided to\ninform, entertain and criticise. This\n\u2022 is a phrase I tend to overuse and it\ncame up in my elections speech last\nyear. Ian Howgate does a great deal:\nsome of it good, and some of it bad\u2014\nthe bad gets criticised. I steer away\nfrom the brown tongue treatment in\nmy editorials.\nSecondly, FELIX printed the\n'irresponsible Ian' news story and Ian\nrefused to speak to our reporters or\nwrite for us! We all sat round waiting\nfor Ian to grow up.\nThirdly, the author of the opinion\narticle draws a comparison between\nthe treatment of Ian with that of Carl\nBurgess, President of IC Union in\n1985/6. In that year, the FELIX\neditorials went on about trivia while\nCarl was getting away with murder.\nThis did more damage to the Union\nthan telling everybody would have\ndone.\nFourth, Ian puts a lot of work into\nhis job. He was the only one who\nreally wanted to be President this year\nand he is going out to prove that he\nwas the best choice. Ian is a good\nPresident because he cares about his\njob. He is, however, irresponsible in\nthe things he says and not at all good\nat working with people. He ought to\ntake a tip or four from College\nSecretary John Smith about\ndiplomacy. He is also extremely easy\nto wind up.\nFifth, it's Ian's wacky ideas that\nmade FELIX a good read every\nFriday!\nIf Ian learns to calm down, and to\nthink before he speaks then I reckon\nthat he will make a jolly good\nPresident.\nThe other sabbaticals\nHaving passed judgement about Ian,\nI feel that it is only right to give brief\nviews on Alan Rose, Deputy\nPresident, and Chas Jackson, Hon\nSecretary.\nAlan, as far as I have heard, has\nbeen efficient. He also has the\nmarvellous gift of sounding like he\nknows what he is talking about. He\nhelped to collate last week's FELIX\nso he has gained this week's FELIX\nSabbatical Gold Star Award.\nChas Jackson, on the other hand,\nhas turned out to be the joke\nsabbatical. Chas is very good at\nreading newspapers but I don't think\nthat is part of the Honorary\nSecretary's job description. He is not\nvery good at getting council papers\nready, insurance dealt with or\nproblems sorted out. Chas, however,\nis a nice person, which is why I 've\nnever mentioned his faults before.\nDrink a Pub Dry\nThis has to be one of the stupidest\nideas for raising money for Rag\u2014it\ndoesn't raise any! Why do they go out\nto a place which they obviously can't drink dry (this year it was the\nUniversity of London Union Bar) and\nspend all the money they've got left.\nNo wonder nobody has enough\nmoney to go to the Guilds Carnival.\nMorphy Day\nHiss! Boo! The ICU Executive didn't bother to turn up to Morphy Day on\nWednesday\u2014after they told me that\nFELIX had to make up the fourth man\nof their boat crew. Our boy, Sports\nEditor Dominic Strowbridge, went\nthrough rigorous training to be\nselected from the fine athletes that\nfrequent the FELIX Office. I bet we\nwould have won as well!\nStudent survey\nWe have another one of our special\nFELIX surveys in this week's issue.\nWe have used the same questions as\ntwo years ago which should enable us\nto see how the average IC student has\nchanged. I would be grateful if you\ncould get your answers into the\ninternal mail either today or on\nMonday so that we will have the\nresults analysed for the 4th December\nissue.\nRag\nWith so many different rag totals\nrolling into the Office this week, I'd also like to announce that FELIX\nmade just under \u00a3200 for IC Rag last\nweek. Thank you to everybody who\ngave 20p for small ads and diary\nentries and to all last week's advertisers.\nBad debts\nThe Union Print Unit runs to break\neven. We charge for materials used\nonly because the Union pays all the\nlabour costs. We make no profit on\nthe printing we do for Union clubs\nand societies. We sometimes even\nundercharge! Like every\norganisation, we tend to undergo cash\nflow problems during parts of the\nyear. These problems are brought\nabout by people not paying their bills.\nWe give everybody one month's credit and only one month's credit.\nThe following individuals and clubs\nare bad debtors and will not be able\nto use the services of FELIX or the\nPrint Unit until they pay up:\nAmnesty International\nNigerian Soc\nChas Jackson\nCSSA\nAnti-Apartheid\nConSoc\nNicky Alison\nLester Kerschenbaum\nWIST\nSocSoc\nDocSoc\nSelkirk Hall\nChemSoc\nNightline\nYacht Club\nBilliards & Snooker\nRCSU\nRSM\nDon't expect to see any diary entries\nfrom any of these!\nFinally...\nWe've run out of sweatshirts for the\nmoment but there are more on order\nfor Christmas.\nThere will be a staff meeting at 1pm today.\nEditor-in-chief Judith Hackney Chris Martin News Editor Andrew Waller Reviews Editor Ashley Ni block Features Editor Dave Burns Clubs Editor Kamala Sen News Features Editor Bill Goodwin Sports Editors . . . .

    "content": "The ladies' Novice Crew\nBOAT\nHeading for home\nFours Head of the River Race\nThis 3-mile race on the Thames,\nbetween Barnes and Putney Bridge\nproduced a good showing from the 9\nImperial College crews in a field of nearly 500 crews.\nThe top two crews came 6th and 8th overall and 2nd and 3rd in their\ndivision of cox less fours only being\nbeaten by the Great Britain crew who\ncame 4th in the World Championships\n1987. This was an excellent result for\nthese two crews as they beat the top\ncrews from Oxford, Cambridge and\nthe University of London.\nThe third crew came in a respectable 33rd, second in their\nsenior A cox less fours division. The\nfourth crew also obtained a good\nresult coming 61st overall and 3rd in\nthe Senior A cox ed fours division,\nbeing pipped by Cambridge by one\nsecond and tieing with Oxford\nUniversity.\nThe Collegesfifthand sixth crews\nboth the Senior A cox less fours\ndivision also performed well coming\n74th and 101st respectively.\nLower down the Club, the crews\nalso performed well, all coining fairly\nhigh up in their divisions. The Senior\nC cox ed four coming 220th overall\nwhile the men's and women's Novice\ncox ed fours (both crews having\nmembers who have started rowing\nthis year), coming 342nd and 411th respectively.\nThese results show the depth of\nrowing in the Club with the top crews\nup with the international crews and\nthe Novices holding their own against\ncrews of the same status.\nTEN-PIN BOWLING\nBowled over\nIC 10\u2014Brunei University 0\nIC came into their fourth game of the\nseason needing a convincing victory\n(ie a whitewash!) over Brunei to have\nany chance of qualifying for the\nUCTBA quarter-finals.\nAny hopes of winning the match\nseemed to have evaporated when all\nfour squads lost their first games\n(although the ladies were unlucky to\ngo down 461:460). What followed\ncan only be described as a remarkable\nImperial recovery with a simultaneous\nBrunei collapse\u2014not only did IC\nrecover from their perilous position\nbut all squads went on to win their\nremaining games convincingly\nenough for a100 match result.\nSAILING\nWind problems\nThis week we set off at a mere\nleisurely time of 10.30am, to our\nvenue at Queen Mary Sailing Club,\nagainst City (some 2 hours after our\nusual departure time). Cheered by this\nfact we arrived in good spirit spurred\non by the fact that there was a force\n5 wind blowing.\nCity were first out and made a noticeable lead on IC but not being\nput down IC fought back with some\nhair raising sailing to regain an overall\nlead by the end of the day.\nThere had been a few swimming\nlessons for the crews of a couple of\ndinghy s but most managed to stay\nupright despite the wind problems.\nRUGBY\nConfident and\nrampant\nIC 1st XV 19\u2014Brunei University 3\nThis was always going to be the\ntoughest game in the group, but after\nthree successive victories in the UAU\nIC were confident of a good win.\nUnfortunately the weather was very\npoor and there were few glimpses of\nthe IC attacking play from previous\nweeks. The team were well psyched-up and from the kick off the IC\nforwards drove the opposition back\nto their own five yard line and from\nthe resulting scrum Andy Taylor\ncharged down and attempted a kick\nfor Rog Hargrove to score the first\nof three tries.\nA few minutes later good kicking\nfrom Mike Anderson pinned Brunei\nin their own 22 and from a scrum ten\nyards out, a now rampant IC pack\ndrove for a number 8 push over try.\nBrunei then rallied against IC and the\nwind, and after swapped penalties, IC\nlead at half-time 13-3\nThe second half was going to be\nhard for IC with only a ten point lead\nand severe conditions against them.\nIC now changed tactics keeping\nthings tight and playing for territory,\nas Jamie Mills was beginning to\ndom in te in the line outs.\nA determined solid defence kept\nBrunei for the first twenty minutes\nwith great tackling from Adrian\nKendell and James Deny, as IC\nbegan to claw back into the\nopposition's half. With fifteen\nminutes to go IC were awarded a penalty fifteen yards out. And from\nthe number 1 move Rob Hargrove\ncrossed to score his third. A tremendous result for IC leaving\nRugby unbeaten in the UAU with 123\npoints for and 16 against. The man\nof the match was Tim 'Sniffer' Paul.\nWATER-POLO\nPenguin flopped\nIC Water-polo 14\u2014Penguins III 4\nThe match started on even terms\n(0-0); the Penguins surprised IC by\nopening the scoring. The rest of the\nquarter was hard-fought, ending 3-3.\nAfter this IC's superior fitness\npulled through, and the reserves\nproved that they were actually very\ncompetent (despite Andre's designer\nbermuda shorts). IC pulled ahead and\ngenerally annihilated the\nopposition\u2014final score 14-4.\nBADMINTON\nSlow shuttles,\nfast toes\nGood performances from all the\nteams so far have meant that Men'sH are su j re to qualify for the next\nstages of UAU while Mens I and\nLadies both need a good win over\nKent to make absolutely certain. It is\nparticularly good to see the Ladies\nteam doing so well having lost 4\nplayers from the side that have been\nrunners-up in the UAU\nChampionships for the last 2 years.\nWhile the present pairs are not as\nstrong as their predecessor they are\nnevertheless producing the results that\ncount.\nIn the Hammersmith League, the\nmixed team has had a good start with\n8-1 and 7-2 victories against Whitton\nand Crescent respectively. The latter\nmatch was notable only for the\nincredibly slow shuttles that were\nused. Julie and Sean got themselves\nin a right old mess before they\nrealised that the shuttle could not be\nkilled, and that maybe a 'push' game\nwas a better idea, Bharat and Uta\nplayed level doubles as opposed to\nconventional mixed and Simon and Jo\n(in her first match) played very well\nto win 2 of their 3. Jo then spent the\nrest of the evening being persuaded\nby one of the Crescent men to play\nwith his big toes!!\nAt that point we decided to leave.\nHOCKEY\nSpare gears\nIt has been a disappointing week for\nIC 1st XL By far the worst\nperformance was against Brunei on\nWednesday. Apart from when the ball\ncame straight at him, stoned\ngoalkeeper Rolf Slatter was totally\ninanimate. In the outfield, the forward\nline failed to capital is e on IC's ample\npossession and the defence of\nStonham, Garside, Lewis and\nBrooking looked hopelessly static\na gs in st Brunei's fluid team-work.\nOn Sunday the l sts turned out\nagainst Guilds (alias IC 2nds!) in the\nfirst round of the UL Cup. Despite\nonly having nine players, C&G fought all the way with Andy Rogers\nand Duncan Fitter both scoring sharp\ngoals and attracting the attentions of\n1st team skipper Justin Brooking. As\none would have expected, however,\nthe l sts cruised home 8-2 (Paul\nSkipworth\u20143), with several gears to\nspare.\n20 Friday November 20th1987 FELIX\n\n"

The letter entitled Tn the ear of the\nbeholder' was second to none in its 'politeness' and sense\nof good fun; Ray Bradbury would, no doubt, have agreed\nwith Mr Cholesterol's fatty acidic comments.\nBroadsheet tries to amuse as many of its readers as\npossible in order to stop them feeling 'pissed off; if this\ndoes not work for you Mr Cholesterol, I'm sorry, there\nis no accounting for taste. Maybe you should have written\nto Broadsheet in order to display your great command of\nthe English Language, no matter, apathy rules, OK? While I'm putting pen to paper, I'd like to say a little\nabout the idea of Norman's selling condoms. Is Norman\nserious? Are Imperial College students now expected to\nrestrict their sexual activities to lunchtime and early\nevening, and will the current ICU policy concerning sex\nin the Union Building have to be changed? One last\nquestion; does this herald the world's first ever tando ori condom?\nYours, in bad CCU taste and poly saturated ly, Dave Smedley, RCS Broadsheet Editor 87/88.\nwho has had to make the decision and secondly I have\ntaken the trouble to talk to those people who have the\nmajority of the burden to bare\u2014women!\nI assume that the objection being raised is, not to all\nabortions whether they be for physical or ps cho logical reasons but to those abortions on the grounds of 'unwanted\ncomplications'. So what constitutes an 'unwanted\ncomplication'? Poverty, ille gita macy, ambition, possible\nhandicap, you name it, there are loads of reasons all of\nthem very important to the individuals concerned\u2014and\nI think that this is the key fact that everyone seems to be\noverlooking. There is always a danger that in laying down\nthe law for the majority, the needs of the individual are\nignored, but in a matter such as this, the needs of the\nindividual are overwhelmingly important. No responsible\nwoman takes the decision lightly, they always suffer great\nagonies before deciding either way\u2014so who are we to say\nthat we know better! We can answer for ourselves\n(possibly) but God help us all if we lose that freedom of\nchoice.\nAnd then there is the question of the exact point, during\na pregnancy, at which 'cell division' becomes child\ngrowth. This is the pivot about which morality questions\nmust revolve. I would argue that this point occurs when\nthe developing foetus 'thinks' for the first time. We all\nknow of hypnotic regression back to the foetal stage, but\nhow far back does that memory go? Until this is answered\nthe debate will continue\u2014I hope it is answered soon so\nthat a definite date can be given for the beginning of life.\nSteve Mercer, Physics III.\nWharfdale Threats?\nDear Judith,\nIn reply to Simon Cholerton's letter ( FELIX No784).I have provided a little illustration which will hopefully\nshow that my Engish is not as degenerate as he would have\nus believe. Take it away Wharfdale...\nYours sincerely,\nNoel P Curry, Chem III.\nP.S.I' d rather be 'pissed off than pissed on.\nOpinionated\nDear Judith,\nIn last week's FELIX, Hugh MacKenzie laid down\nsomething of a challenge; to answer the question\u2014'How\ncome a woman can choose to end the life of her child\nsimply because it is still in her womb?'. I would like to\ntake up that challenge.\nOK, so what makes me different from all the rest of\nthe uninformed and opinionated dross who spout forth\nvoluminous quantities of rhetoric on what you should and\nshouldn't do? Well, firstly I have 'been there' for someone\nA letter received by FELIX earlier this week for the\nspecial attention of the Guilds President, Dave Tyler.\nDear Dave,\nIf the attendance figures at the Carnival aren't what you\nwould have liked them to be, it's probably because no one\nknows there actually is a Carnival. In an interview with\nSTOIC (and we still have it on videotape if you feel like\nquibbling, so if I were you I'd keep my mouth shut) you\nsaid that it would be impossible to move around Imperial\nCollege without seeing publicity for this Carnival, Well,\nI 've been moving around College quite a bit, and I 'll be\nbugger ed if I can see one tiny speck of publicity. Actually,\nthat's not quite true. I have seen two posters. One was\nhanging off the wall in the Union Building by a solitary\npiece of blue tack, and the other looked as if a bird had\ngone to the toilet on it. A bit prophetic, perchance?\nDon't you have anything better to do except 'phoning\nus up and ranting insane and utterly meaningless threats?\nI seem to recall that this isn't our first brush with you.\nDidn't you once threaten to take away all our funds? We\nall had a good laugh over that one, I can tell you.\nHaving said all these nasty things, I would like to end\non a somewhat more sympathetic note. Brain cells are very\nvaluable things, and since you're so short in that\ndepartment, why don't you just abandon your attempts\nat rational thought altogether?\nAnd another thing; right after your first nasty 'phone call, you rang again asking for a video cassette player! A bit\ntwo faced, don't you think? Anyway the answer is 'get\nsodded, Tyler'. This being written'on Tuesday evening,\nand I hope that you still haven't found a VCR! Yours sincerely,\nCharles Robin, STOIC Hon Sec.\nP.S. Dave, you're not nice. That's why no one likes you.\nFELIX Friday November 20th198723 "

    "content": "Imperial College is fortunate to\npossess one of the best student\npublications in the country. It is well\nlaid out, printed in house and contains\nsome well researched features. Few,\nif any other universities can boast a student publication which is read by\nthe staff as well as the students. For\nmany people FELIX is their only link\nwith the activities of the Union and\nthe only way they can learn of\ndevelopments taking place in College.\nAnd now the shocking complaint\nFELIX is biased\u2014and not only is it\nbiased, it is biased almost exclusively\nagainst the Union President Ian\nHowgate. The reason for this is that\ncertain key people within the FELIX\nOffice simply do not get on with Mr\nHowgate. As a result we have slanted\nnews stories, and editorials which slag\noff Mr Howgate over trivia whilst\nignoring the work he has done.\nWhat apl on kerI an has been this week! A biased FELIX does provide\ninteresting reading, but it also causes\ndamage to FELIX. Can we blame Mr\nHowgate for refusing to co-operate\nwith certain members of FELIX on\nmajor news stories, such as\n'Harlington Gravel'? In the past he\nhas been quoted out of context and the\nstories he has provided have been\nslanted against him. Clearly this is\nalso damaging to FELIX. Mr\nHowgate is not the only source of\nnews, but this year's lack of a regular\nnews editor has made it difficult for\npeople to find the time to pursue news\nthrough alternative routes. The\nproblem has been exacerbated with\nthe decision of certain FELIX staff\n'moles' not to co-operate with FELIX\nuntil the paper starts being less biased\nagainst Mr Howgate. You can get\nround this problem by filling the\npaper with stories about the\nhappenings within Union committees,\nbut to be honest this makes dull\nreading.\nI cannot say that I agree with Ian's decision not to write a weekly piece\nfor the Union page, but I can\nunderstand his viewpoint. Why\nshould he co-operate with FELIX\nwhen FELIX appears out to get him?\nAn article in the RCS Broadsheet a few weeks ago by a disillusioned\nfresher illustrates the point. The\nwriter stated that he didn't have a clue\nwhat, if anything, the President did\nwith his time and used this, albeit\nillogically, as a basis for criticising\nMr Howgate's effectiveness. If this\nopinion is representative of most of\nthe students, it is not surprising that\nthe average student shows little\ninterest in Union affairs. The attitude\ncontinually expressed in the pages of\nFELIX, that Ian is a wally, does little\nto ease the situation.\nIs FELIXReaUyBiased?\nI have to include this section by means\nof defence for the s lagging off I am\ngoing to get in next week's issue.\nWhat follows are a few examples\nwhich illustrate the point. I hope you\nwill bear with me if the analysis of\nthe stories becomes a bit technical,\nbut this is necessary. I am not out to\nattack the people who wrote the\narticles: I have talked to the people\nFreshers' Week even better than the\nbest in London.\nIt is understandable that the writer\nmight mistake \"that\" for \"it\",\nparticularly when the interview was\nplayed over the phone from IC radio\nto FELIX, as was the case. However\nthe whole story was slanted. The rest\nof it devoted a large space to John\nNoble's response to his alleged\ns lagging off, quoted verbatim. If Ian\nhad been given equal column inches\nand also quoted verbatim instead of\nparaphrasing, the story would have\nbecome much more representative of\nthe truth.\nconcerned and they genuinely believe\nthat their articles were unbiased. I am\nalso well aware that the FELIX editor\nis often under a lot of pressure and\ndoes not have time to check\neverything that appears in FELIX. I am not out to blame individuals.\nNevertheless some of the articles\nwhich have appeared are below the\nbelt. I do not he liev eI am alone in\nthis opinion; other Union officers\nhave said much the same thing and\neven the Rector has commented that\nFELIX is a unfair towards Mr\nHowgate.\nIrresponsibleIan,,,\nLet's take a story from the Freshers'\nedition: \"Irresponsible Ian Attacks\nFreshers' Week\". According to the\nstory, Ian (speaking in an IC radio\ninterview) had criticised John Noble\nfor organising a poor Freshers'\nWeek. In fact, listening to the tape,\nit becomes apparent that the opposite\nwas true. Ian had complimented John\non the work he had put in and\ndeclared the IC Freshers' Week to be\none of the best in London, but\u2014here\ncomes the crunch\u2014added that it could\nbe made even better.\nIn the FELIX news story, Ian is\nquoted as saying of Freshers week:\n\"it's not good enough\". What he\nactually said (and this is recorded in\nthe radio interview) was, referring to\nFreshers' Week being the best in\nLondon, \"that's not good enough\".\nHe went on to mention an idea he had\nwhich could make Imperial's Another subtle example Issue 782 included a story\nentitled\"Censors' Happy Ending\",\nwhich covered a motion calling,for\nthe ICU handbook editor to have total\neditorial control. Let me quote a line\nfrom the story: \"This motion will\nnow be submitted to the next UGM\nas an amendment to a previous motion\nwhich had suffered many amendments\nput forward by Ian Howgate.\" Here\nwe have a classic example of an\nopinion coming across as though it\nwere a fact. The statement that Ian\nHowgate'sam mend ment s were\nderogatory must be an opinion: Ian\nHowgate was of the opinion that they\nwere beneficial, the writer that they\nwere not. Who was right?...well,\nthat's a matter of opinion.\nSomemorerantings...\nBias against Ian has not been limited\nto the news pages. In the editorial\npages, Mr Howgate has been\ncriticised for not telling anyone about\nthe postgraduate hall before the\nUGM. Who was he supposed to tell?\nHe told told an Exec meeting on the\nday he learnt of the proposal and\ninformed the students at the first\nopportunity\u2014the UGM, which took\nplace a week later. I suppose the real\ngripe was that he did not inform\nFELIX, but I have already explained\nwhy Ian and FELIX are not on\nspeaking terms.\nDisappointing,,,\nIn another editorial, Judith explained\nhow she had been easy on Ian, and\ncould if she wanted to slag him off\na good deal more. I was disappointed;\nall that emerged were criticisms\nwhich were either untrue or totally\ntrivial, some of which I have quoted\nabove. It is the duty of the FELIX\neditor to criticise the President when\nhe or she is not doing the job\nproperly. Can we assume that, given\nFELIX's apparent need to invent\ncriticism that Ian might actually be\ndoing a good job? Perish the thought!\nIs it aU FELIX' s fault?\nThe last time a Sabbatical was made\nto look silly in FELIX was during\nCarl Burgess' presidency. Carl\ndeserved the criticism he got: he was\nrarely sober and did no work for the\nUnion. Ian, on the other hand, works\nextremely hard, there is one\nsimilarity: both Carl and Ian set\nthemselves up as easy targets.\nI think that the way Ian has reacted\nto bias against him in FELIX is\npartially responsible for that bias\ncontinuing. Ian's reaction was to\nwithdraw from FELIX and offer it no\nco-operation, to the point where no\nlonger reads the publication. This is\na reasonable reaction. People often\nforget that the Union President is as\nhuman as everyone else\u2014how would\nyou feel if you put a hell of a lot of\nwork into the Union, only to have\nFELIX tear you to pieces every week\nwith stories which were more often\nthan not untrue? It is understandable\nthat Ian is upset, but in this case it\nwould be better if Ian stood his\nground. How can FELIX have a chance of being less biased if the\nPresident is reluctant to put his side\nof the story? How can Jo Student\nlearn about the work Ian has put into\nthe Union, if he refuses to write his\npresidential piece for FELIX?\nWithdrawing only makes him an easy\ntarget for the anti-Howgate faction.\nYou may not agree with everything\nI have said in this article, but (even\nignoring the fine details of the\nargument) it is apparent that there is\na problem between Ian Howgate and\nFELIX and that it is harming both\nFELIX and the Union. It was\nnecessary to point out the in acc urc ies in some of the FELIX news stories,\nparticularly since, as a result of\nFELIX, many students believe that\nIan is incompetent. This is patently\nuntrue. Ian has accomplished more\nfor the Union this term than some\nPresidents do in a whole year.\nHopefully bringing the problem to\nlight will be a first step towards\nsolving it. Both sides need to back\ndown.\nFELIX Friday November 20th19879 "

The machines comprise an\nexceptionally high proportion of\ncomponents manufactured in Japan\nand the USA, in relation to those from\nnon-specific areas of the Far East.\n2. A wide range of specifications\nshould be available to order, from\nfully expandable 8MHz twin floppy\ndir ve machines with mon ocr home graphics to 'beyond' 15MHz AT's with Super-EGA level graphics.\n3. Each system in the range has\nbeen engineered to provide a balanced, high performance mix of\nhigh quality reliable components eg.\nNEC, Intel, Toshiba, Misubishi,\nMiniscribe, Western Digital, Precise\n(of Japan), and though they are\ndesigned to run under PCDOS 3.30\n(how compatible can you get?),\nMSDOS 3.1 (+GW Basic) will be\navailable as an option.\n4. The prices compare very\nfavourably with those of other cut-price machines (such as Amstrad) in\nso far as competing machines are able\nto offer roughly equivalent\nspecifications.\n5. Delivery, subject to ICU\napproval of the equipment, should\ncommence this month.\nHow to be open-minded\n(Seeing stars helps)\nAstronomy is man's attempt to look outside the\nconfines of his own world.\nWith the naked eye we can see an\nexpanse of thousands of stars. With a telescope\nand camera even more detail is revealed but still\nthe immense ness is unfathomable.\nReligion is man's attempt to look outside\nthe confines of his own person and that of\nsociety to a spiritual dimension which he\nsupposes exists.\nThe problem he faces here, however, is\nfar greater. There are no instruments available to\nmake measurements on the spiritual world.\nSubsequently many people dismiss it as\nnon-existent while others invent their own\nreligion.\nHowever, in Jesus, God gives us an\ninstrument through which we may see the\nspiritual world.

    "content": "Features\nover the Strategic Defence Initiative\n(Star Wars) for the INF talks but it\nis unlikely to be as obliging in the\nensuing talks. There is ac once nus amongst scientist that SDI will not be\nfeasible, the Soviet Union are worried\nthat a partial defence system might be\npossible. Under these circumstances\nthey see only one possible role for\nSDI; to mop up a Soviet counter strike\nwhen most of the Soviet missiles have\nalready been destroyed by an\nAmerican first strike. Nevertheless,\nit is questionable whether Star Wars,\nin its present form, will last beyond\nPresident Reagan's term of office.'\nIn the wake of September's meeting\nbetween Schultz and Schevarnadze,\nthe Superpowers have produced draft\nSTART documents calling for across\nthe board Inter Continental Ballistic\nMissile (ICBM) reductions of 50%.\nIt is likely that the Americans will be\nlooking for specific reductions in the\nSoviet SSI8 stockpile, as these\nmissiles are p received as a threat to\nthe US Minuteman Silos. Similarly\nthe Soviet Union will be looking for\nreductions in the Trident II missiles\nwhich threaten the SS20 silos.\nBefore any deals can be signed the\nproblem of verification must be\nconsidered. How can one side ensure\nthat the other is not cheating ?\nInevitably this will mean that both\nsides will have to cooperate and make\nconcessions, but this is not as unlikely\nas it would first appear. The route to\ncooperation has already been paved\nby the Stockholm Accord, agreed last\nyear be teen NATO and the Warsaw\nPact. The accord calls for either side\nto provide notification in advance\nwhen it conducts military exercises\nwith over 35000 troops, and in this\nway aims to prevent either side\nlaunching a surprise conventional\nattack on the other.\nThe Verification Technology\nInformation Centre (VERTIC) has\nsuggested possible verification\nscenarios for both START and INF.\nAny agreement must be followed by\nan exchange of data between the two\nsides on their missile facilities; the\nnumber of missiles, launchers and the\ncapability of the missiles. The data\nsupplied to one side would be checked\nwith intelligence data obtained from\nphoto reconnaissance and\neavesdropping on radio\ntransmissions. Satellite technology\nwill come into play here, for example\nwith the American K series satellites\nwhich can have an estimated\nresolution of up to50 cm per pixel and\nSignals Intelligence Satellites\n(SIGINT) which can snoop on the\nother side's telecommunications.\nWhen both sides are satisfied that the\ndata is correct, steps will have to be\ntaken to monitor missile movements.\nThis will require on sight inspections\nto ensure that all is fair and above\nboard.\nThe war heads, it is suggested, can\nbe disposed of in purpose built plants\noperated by the monitored side and\nsupervised by the monitoring side.\nHere the verifying country would\ncount the number of warheads going\ninto the plant checking to determine\nwhether they were genuine. This can\nbe achieved by passing a neutron\nbeam through the warhead and\nmonitoring the resulting radiation.\nThe fissile material would then be\nremoved, unobserved by the verifying\nside, before re-emerging to be\nautomatically destroyed. The fissile\nmaterial could be destroyed in\ncommercial nuclear reactors or\nalternatively held in safe storage\nunder the auspices of the Atomic\nEnergy Authority or a similar body.\nA thorny question which still has\nto be resolved concerns the fate of\nmobile missiles such as the Soviet\nSS25, the American Midgetman, the\nUS Tomahawk cruise missile and its\nSoviet equivalent, branded the\n\"Tomahawkski\". According to\nVertic, a complete ban on mobile\nmissiles is unlikely. These missiles\nare problematic because they can be\nmerged into the countryside, and\nhidden aboard ships and submarines,\nmaking it difficult for one side to\nknow precisely how many missiles\nthe other side posses es. In the past, arms agreements have\nfailed to prevent the escalation of the\narms race but have merely pushed it\ninto other directions. For example the\nSALT 1 treaty stipulated limits on\nmissile launchers, with the result the\nboth sides developed missiles with\nmultiple warheads. Likewise the\nThreashold Ban Treaty (1974) limited\ntest explosions to 150 kilo tonnes, and\nboth sides began to concentrate on\nsmaller, more accurate missiles.\nThe deployment of sea-launched\ncruise missiles may similarly render\nthe INF accord ineffective, unless the\nsuperpowers take action. The US\nAirforce had intended to deploy 464\nTomahawk ground launched cruise\nmissiles by late 1988, and 200 of\nthese have al read been deployed.\nAlthough these will be dismantled\nunder the INF deal, the American\nNavy plans to deploy 758 nuclear\nTomahawks at sea. This will result in\none third of the US fleet being armed\nwith nuclear missiles, and the\nsituation is made more complex with\nplans to place 3000 conventional\nTomahawks along side them. The\nSoviets are expected to follow suit this\nyear with the deployment of sea\nlaunched cruise missiles of 3000km range. Hence, unless this aspect is\ntaken into account in the START\ntalks, argue Vertic, the INF deal will\nbecome merely a codification of the\narms race. So far sea lau ched missiles\nhave been given little discussion.\nAs mentioned earlier, mobile\nmissiles present particular problems\nwhen it comes to verification. The\nsituation is exacerbated by the\ncombination of conventional and\nnuclear cruise missiles at sea. If\nlimit ions are agreed upon, stringent\nverification methods will be required.\nOne of the requirements will be the\ncontinuous monitoring of missile\nplant perimeters. This could be\nachieved by installation of tamper\nproof video cameras at perimeter exits\nto record the number of missiles\nleaving the plant. The plants would\nbe monitored by inspectors from the\nverifying side to ensure that the\ncameras were not tampered with.\nRadiation counters would be used to\ncheck whether the warheads of the\nmissiles leaving the plant were\nnuclear or conventional, and the\ninspectors would have the right to\nexamine any piece of equipment\nleaving the plant which could possibly\nhide a missile.\nVertic suggest that a form of\nelectronic tagging might be used to\nensure that missiles are not being\nmanufactured in clandestine factories.\nThe technology exists to produce\ntamper proof electronic tags which\nwould record the batch number and\nplace of manufacture of the missile.\nThese tags would be manufactured by\nthe verifying side and installed by the\nverified side. During on site\ninspections the tags would be\nexamined for tampering, and if any\nmissiles were found with\ninappropriate tags or tags missing\nthen this would indicate a violation of\nthe arms control agreement.\nTwo types of tags have been,\nconsidered by the military. Passive\ntags would act as a unique identifier\nfor a particular missile. One such type\nwould make use of the random\npatterns of fiberglass in the missile\ncanister. This would be\n\"photographed\" by a stereoscopic\ncamera or an acoustic hologram\nimage r. Another type of tag would\nmake use of an un re pro du cable pattern of fibre optic cables which\nwould again be photographed. Active\ntags would consist of a number\nsequence stored in a microchip to\nidentify each missile. One possibility\nis a tag which will make use of\nNAVSTAR satellites to record the\nposition of the missile. The tags\nwould be read at intervals and the\nrecorded position of missiles be\ncompared to photo reconnaissance photographs. If the two do not tally,\nthen this must be a strong indication\nthat a treaty violation must have\noccured.\nThe technology for arms\nverification does exist, and can be\napplied to difficult areas such as\nmobile and sea-launched missiles.\nWhether or not the superpowers\npossess the political will to use the\ntechnology as a basis for arms\nreductions remains to be seen. It is\nimportant to remember that the INF\ndeal can only represent a first step, on the route to further reductions. If\nthese are not forthcoming then the\ndeal, impressive though it sounds,\nwill not reduce the escalation in\nnuclear weaponry; it will merely\nsucceed in changing the emphasis of\nthe arms race. Beyond that, a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty will\nhinge upon the question of SDI. If this\nissue is not resolved, the prospects for\na genuine reduction in the arms\nstockpile seem grim.\nThanks to Vertic and Jerry Legget\nfor invaluable help in preparing this\narticle, Reagan and Gorbachov for\nbeing good sports, and Judith for not\nstarting the third world war.\nFELIX Friday November 20th1987 "

Since its\ninitiation, Vertic has established a wide range of contacts amongst peace\nand weapons researchers in both the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union\nwhich enables it to provide briefings\nfor politicians, the press and members\nof the public as well as discussion\ndocuments for the Ministry of\nDefence.\nJeremy Leggett founded the\norganisation as a gut reaction to a visit\nhe paid to Hiroshima and Nagasaki\ntwo years ago. 'It was a very\ndepressing experience,' he says, 'until\nyou've seen the effects, you don't realise how destructive nuclear\nweapons can be. You realise that\nwhen people talk about a limited\nnuclear war it's an absolute joke'.\nHe is however optimistic about the\narms talks due to begin next month,\n'The whole subject of\nverification is like a fog to\nthe general public'\nwhen the question of verification will\nbecome a major issue. The\nsuperpowers have tabled draft treaties\nwhich call for the intrusive\nmonitoring of missile production\nfactories, challenge inspections of the\nsites of suspected violations and onsite inspectors to witness the\ndestruction of weapons. Vertic's role\nis to investigate how this can best be\ncarried out. Three working groups\nhave been set up by the organisation\nto discuss and collate information on\nsatellite remote sensing, seismic\nmonitoring and verification strategies.\nAn independent Oversight and\nAdvisory Committee presides to\noversee the work of the committees\nbefore their conclusions are released\nto the public.\nVertic receives a mixed reaction\nfrom the Ministry of Defence and\nthose in Government. Dr Leggett\nbelieves that civil servants\n>Dr Lewis\noccasionally use 'verification\ndifficulties' as a smoke screen for\npolitical unwillingness to enter into\narms agreements. The Foreign Office\nis more helpful, however, when it\ncomes to discussing the problems of\nchemical weapons, which the USSR\npossess and Britain does not. Political\nbarriers, though, occur at all levels;\n'The sad thing about Vertic's Parliamentary Seminars,' says Dr\nLeggett, 'is that if a Tory is chairing\nthe meeting then Labour stay clear\nand vice versa.'\nThe Vertic office can be found\nabove the 'Bonbon' restaurant in\nSouthampton Street off the Strand.\nPatricia Lewis, a nuclear physicist\nfrom Birmingham University, is\nVertic's full-time information officer.\nShe is assisted in her duties by Dave\nWooding, a voluntary researcher,\nformerly a physics student at\nImperial. The group is supported\nfinancially with a3 year grant of\n\u00a380,000 from the Rowntree Trust and\nCadbury's. At present Vertic has the resources\nto collect and disseminate information\nand to cover the expenses of arms\ncontrol experts for lectures and\nbriefing sessions. Next year,\nhowever, the organisation will be\napplying to a number of foundations\nfor funding for technical research into\nverification techniques. Dr Leggett\nbelieves that there is un sufficient research being carried out in this area\nand stresses the need for independent\nresearch.\nIn Britain and the United States\nverification research is carried out by\nthe weapons laboratories which\ninevitably have to operate within the\npolicies of their respective\ngovernments. 'This seems a bit like\nentrusting the supervision of\nprohibition to a group of a loco holi cs,' says Dr Leggett. He believes that\nthere is a great scope for universities\nto carry out work on verification.\nInformation freely available from\nsatellites\u2014such as SPOT and\nLANDSAT\u2014-for example, can reveal\nnew missile silos, but no civilian work\nis being carried out in this area nor\nhave British scientists been able to\nfind funding to take up the Soviet\ninvitation to install seismic monitoring\nequipment around their nuclear\ntesting grounds.\nAlthough universities in the United\nStates have departments specialising\nin arms control and offer verification\ncourses, this is something British\nuniversities shy away from. The fact\nthat the Official Secrets Act makes\ngathering the appropriate information\nmore difficult-in this country, and a British tendency to 'leave things to the\nGovernment' may go some way to\nexplain their reluctance. Vertic has\nbeen able to get around the problem\nposed by the Secrets Act by making\nuse of experts from the United States;\nunder the American Freedom of\nInformation Act they are able to\ndivulge information which might be\nregarded as sens it ve in the UK.\nDr Legget\nHistoric\nDeals\nFor the first time in the history of\narms negotiations, the Superpowers\nare on the verge of signing an accord\nwhich will bring about the scrapping\nof part of the nuclear stockpile. The\nIntermediate Nuclear Forces (INF)\naccord, due for discussion on the 7th December calls for the destruction of\nall ground launched, intermediate\nmissiles, a total of some two thousand\nwarheads. These talks differ from\nthose of previous administrations in\none vital respect; both leaders are\nanxious to reach a settlement. In the\nfollowing article, the Fifth Column\ntakes a look at the significance and\ndangers of the INF deal, examines the\nverf i cation problems it raises and\nlooks towards the deals which are\nlikely to follow in the wake of a sucessful INF agreement.\nOn the face of it, the INF deal will\nresult in a reduction of only 4 % in the\nworld's nuclear stockpile. In practice,\nit will lead to the removal of Cruise\nand other medium range missiles\nfrom Europe. If the negotiations\nproceed as the United States would\nwish, short range intermediate\nmissiles, with a range of 500 to 2500\nkm will be dismantled within a year\nand the longer range missiles with\nranges up to5000 km will go after\nthree years. Both sides have already\nproduced draft treaties which are in\nclose agreement and they are now\nconsidering the fine details of the\naccord. The omens look good for a settlement.\nBeyond INF lies the prospect of a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty\n(START), but the prospects for\nagreement are more tenuous. The\nSoviet Union has put aside its qualms\nFriday November 20th1987 FELIX\n\n"

Mr Hill was flying the HGC's main glider\nat Devil's Dyke on the South Downs.\nHe was about 150 feet above the\nground and there were around 15\ngliders in the air at the time. He had\nbeen flying for twenty minutes and a blue glider had come very close to\nhim on two occasions. He said, T saw\na flash of blue wing above me and\nthen felt a crash on my left wing'.\nMr Hill had to make an emergency\nlanding. The wing cross-tube was\nbadly damaged and will cost\napproximately \u00a3200 to replace. The\nother glider involved, a Harrier, kept\nflying after the crash.\nMr Hill said, T was a bit shocked.\nI didn't know what had happened.\nLooking back, I'm very angry\u2014he\ncould have killed me.\"\nHe accused the other pilot, Mike\nAllen of Southern Club, of 'flying like\na maniac'. Mr Allen admitted\nresponsibility and agreed to pay repair\ncosts.\nA British Hang Gliding Association\nspokesman explained that all pilots of\nhang gliders must follow the rules of\nthe Civil Aviation Authority. There\nis a code of conduct for hang glider\npilots. It includes the words 'when\ntwo gliders are on converging paths\nthe one on the right has the right of\nway'.\nTwo members of the City and\nGuilds College Motor Club, Clive\nHudson and Timo Hannay, were\ninvolved in an accident which wrote\noff their car whilst competing on a club rally last Friday. Mr Hudson was\ndriving down a narrow country road\nwhen he encountered a90 \u00b0 left hand\nbend which only appeared as a50 \u00b0\nbend on navigator Mr Hannay's map.\nThe car, a Mini Countryman 1300,\nwent onto the grass and crashed into\na pile of logs, sustaining considerable\ndamage to the sub frame mountings\nand floorpan. Both occupants were\ntotally unhurt.\nC&G Motor Club Captain Jon\nStout said that accidents on rallies\nwere rare, with only one occurring in\nthe whole of last year. He stated that\nall events are run under RAC Motor\nSports Association rules with all\npossible precautions taken. Drivers\nare fully briefed and cars sc rut in ee red before events and the club is properly\ninsured.\nAlan Rose, Union Deputy\nPresident, feels that the Union should\ncontinue to support 'dangerous' sports\nsuch as hang gliding, caving and\nrallying as long as the clubs are run\nresponsibly.

She was obviously\nnervous about the night as she\ndropped her change (29 pence) and\nhurriedly picked it up.\nThe next celebrity encountered\nwas Rick Astley (or is it Dick\nAstley?). We agreed on the latter as\nhis dress sense was offensive and,\nincidentally, he was noticed by a keen eyed officer of the law to be\nchanging his shoes in the back of\nhis chauffeur-driven black Bentley.\nAn exclusive interview with the\nchaff eur revealed that Dick Astley\nhad, as we suspected, rancid socks.\nDuring the show we noticed that\nDick had changed his shirt. So\nobviously someone had pointed out\nthis blatant clash of clothes, though\nthey couldn't have like him much\nas he was still every designer's nightmare. His miming to the two\nsongs performed was so atrocious\nthat one was unaware which song\nhe was singing.\nEventually the Miss World\ncontestants turned up in three coach\nloads. As they were herded past us\ninto the building we spotted talent\nin Miss Venezuela (the definite\nfavourite), Miss Turkey (who was\nleft out by the judges), Miss France\n(who had a beautiful all over tan),\nMiss Sweden (cute Cindy Doll\nlook-alike) and Miss Israel (a soldier in the Israeli Army). We\nhasten to add that there were many\nunattractive girls ranging from Miss Iceland (a horse of a woman) to\nMiss Belgium who had several\nageing lines around the eyes and\nmouth. We suspect Miss Poland's qualification to the semi-final was\npurely political. Miss Lebanon\nlooked definitely as if she had been\ndragged off the ste ets of war-torn\nBeirut at gun point. Miss UK, yet\nagain, was as attractive as a brick\n(we have seen better at Imperial\nCollege, and Miss Cook Islands\nwas (quite frankly) grotesque. Miss\nDenmark who won an award for\nthe 'most fake' smile of the\nevening, was a sight for sore eyes.\nLast year's Miss World, Gielle\nLaronde (who was accosted by one\nof the P.E.T.S. team), earned our\ngratitude by smiling and waving\nencouragingly at the reporters.\nIt was noticed that most of the\ngirls went in smiling, possibly\nsensing a possible victory. Finally\na Red Rolls Royce drew up with Mr\nand Mrs Morley, the directors of\nMiss World Enterprises, who acted\nas Chairman and prize-giver. They\nwere extremely obliging in posing\nfor our cameras with kind words to\naccompany it.\nSeveral more attempts to find\nTom Smith proved futile and again\nthe security men could not decide\non their story. But who gives a damn about the press any way?\nThey also refused to allow an IRN\n(used by local independent radio\nstations including IC) reporter into\nthe building, because he was unable\nto collect his ticket from inside the\nbuilding. The IRN journalist\nadvised us to come back at 10pm to push our way through to the main\nhall where even then we were\nrefused entry to the stage to join or\nfellow journalists from the world's media to interview the newly-crowned Miss World.\nAfter several attempts to get\ncloser, the management was\noblivious to the right of IC to cover\nsuch local events. Therefore we\nrushed back to the artists' exit to see\nthe departing of the 'cattle' from the\nAlbert Hall, sullen and\nde moral is ed. We were fortunate in getting\nexclusive taped interviews with\nsome of the contestants, but the\nbrain cells between them could not\namount to a coherent sentence.\nEvents like this are obviously a field\nday for the more perverse security\nofficers, one of whom took the\nopportunity to rub himself\nrepeatedly against the very shocked\nMiss India. Scandal of the night was\nrevealed when an officer of the law\ndisclosed that Miss America had\ngiven him her personal phone\nnumber.\nThe night was marred by an\nincident involving the P.E.T.S. photographer who, while trying to\nobtain a photo of Miss World, was\nviciously pushed by an over-ex huber ant security man, desperate\nin his attempt to sit next to Miss\nWorld in the Rolls-Royce. This\nresulted in a minor injury to our\nphotographer but fortunately his\ncamera survived, remaining intact\nand bringing to you all the pictures\nof the night you were lucky enough\nto miss.\nP.E.T.S.

Sterling is the Al\nCapone of Stepney and Carl the\nreformed socialist visionary. During\nhis stay in prison Carl gains 428\ndifferent educational qualifications\nincluding many City and Guilds\ncertificates. He attempts to usurp his\nbrother's bicycle stealing operation by\nsetting up a workers' co-operative\nwith the children Sterling forced to\nsteal bikes.\nCarl's idealistic socialism brings\nhim into conflict with the community\npolice led by Sergeant Chipstick\n(Peter Richardson) and the head of the\n'family firm', his mother (Beryl\nReid).\nBasically, the film is an excuse for\nAlexei Sayle to do a stand up routine\nas he stumbles across London meeting\nold friends. Watch out for the great\nCrime cabaret act by Sterling\u2014Sayle\non home ground. His surreal humour\nis at best hilarious and at worst\nbizarre\u2014\"Where are all the\nspoons?\".\nPlenty of great situations, such as\nthe community police over-60s reggae\nclub, the obligatory Dr Martens\nroutine, Chinese Takeaway and\nArchitects provide an ideal source for\nSayle's observational humour.\nThis is as good a Comic Strip as\nany, but take a beer just in case.\nA.N.

Together they accidentally\nrecieve \u00a33000 and a note meant for\nMr Jolly to 'take out' Nicholas\nParsons (himself). By using both their\nbrain cells together they decide to\nspend all the money on gin. Then they\nthen read the note. By contrived\ncoincidence they end up going out\nwith Nicholas Parsons and trashing\nhis house.\nMeanwhile, the notorious Mr\nLovebucket (Peter Richardson),\nsupplier of most of London's off-licences (the others seem to burn\ndown) catch the pair and force them\nto complete the contract on Parsons,\nsupplying them with a gun, two\ngrenades, a chainsaw and a fluffy\nrabbit!\nThis pure slapstick, Comic Strip\nstyle. Rik and Ade remain alcohol-crazed throughout their escapades and\nare a perfect double act, throwing up\nin all the right places. Peter\nRichardson plays the vicious and quite\nmad Mr Lovebucket convincingly,\nand Nicholas Parsons is suitably\nconfused by the whole affair.

    "content": "The\nempire\nstrikes\nback\nA lot of scientists think that President\nReagan's Strategic Defence Initiative\nis dangerous and unrealistic. There\nare two good reasons for this: we\ncannot write ,and test computer\nsoftware reliably enough to use in\nspotting and destroying high speed\nmissiles; and even if we could, the\nnecessary weapons would be just as\noffensive as the nuclear weapons they\nare supposed to replace. The whole\nproject often seems just like an excuse\nto gain a decisive military lead over\nthe USSR (or 'com mie bastards' as\nthe proponents of SDI call them).\nThose in favour of SDI point out\nthe basic morality of a system that\nrenders nuclear weapons obsolete and\nremoves the present threat of\nMutually Assured Destruction.\nPresumably, if they were so driven\nby moral considerations then they\nwould not have to lie to Congress\nabout the likely success of the\nprogramme. Recent evidence\nsuggests they have been doing just\nthis.\nThe villi an of the piece is Edward\nTeller, the man most often credited\nwith inventing the idea of Star Wars,\nalthough a certain religious figure\nwith horns and a forked tail has also\nbeen mentioned. He is a very capable\nscientist and invented, among o the i things, the Monte Carlo Method,\nwhich is an efficient way of doing\nphysical simulations on computers.\nHe is not the most anti-communist\nperson in the USA in the same sense\nthat Ronald Reagan is not the\nPresident. One of his frustrated\nambitions appears to be to establish\na League of Scientists and\nTechnologistsfor an Instant Nuclear\nWar. He claims, of course, to be\nacting from the highest moral\nprinciples.\nTeller is the man who has to\nconvince congress that SDI is worth\nthe money. Recendy he told them that\nwork on the X ray lasers, a vital\ncomponent in missile-screwing\nweaponry, was proceeding extremely\nrapidly and that a viable weapon\nUNDER THE MICROSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nEditor's bit\u2014oops!\nPart of last week's news story on Chaos got slightly mangled in the typesetting\nand pasting up. Here is the part of the explanation in a slightly different form\n(which is easier to follow and less likely to get confused in type).\nThe do-it-yourself investigation of chaos involves playing with the function:\nf( n)=a.f( nl).(l f( nl)), where n is the number of iterations and f(n) is the\nvalue of the function after n iterations. This is called a recurrence relation\nand defines, from any given starting point, a unique sequence of numbers\nwhere each number is calculated from the previous number in the series. Values\nof a between 0 and 4 produce the interesting results. Starting values of the\nfunction (ie f(0)) should be between 0 and 1. If you have a programmable\ncalculator or computer, it is worth following the sequence for several hundred\niterations (plot a graph of f(n) vs n) If a is less than 3, the sequence will rapidly\nconverge on one number. For a between 3 and about 3.7, the numbers will\noscillate between several values. For a above 3.7 there is no discern able pattern\nin the numbers: this is true chaos. Each series is an appa rend y random list\nof numbers, yet every series is completely determined given the starting\nnumber.\nI hope to have a more detailed exposition of chaos in a future FELIX. This\nwill include some very pretty diagrams and an explanation of what strange\nattractor s, catastrophe theory and fractal geometry have to do with each other.\nI can be contacted via the Chemistry letter racks or on int 4642 if you have\nany comments or suggestions about this column. Would anyone like to\nvolunteer as a reporter and interview members of staff about their work?\nwould be ready in a couple of years.\nA senior worker, Roy Woodruff,\nwho was director of X Ray laser\nwork, at the Lawrence Livermore\nLaboratory, where the experiments\nare done, complained that Teller's presentation to Congress had ignored\nall the snags and difficulties of the\nproject. He also complained that the\ndirector of the Laboratory had let\nTeller go ahead knowing that he was\ntelling whopping great fibs. Woodruff\nis no crypto-com miep in ko subversive: he is perfectly happy to\nmake kill-cannons and X Ray lasers:\nhe just doesn't want to tell lies to\nCongress about the actual success of\nhis projects.\nWoodruff was shunted into a non-job for his complaints. Because the\nAmerican Official Secrets Act isn't as\ngood as ours, it only took him a year\nto get a serious hearing for his\ncomplaints. Congress are not\ninvestigating the issue, and the\nprinciple of the right to dissent\nappears to have been firmly\n\u2022established. Other workers at the\nlaboratory, while not disagreeing with\nSDI, are now pointing out that many\nof Teller's claims are seriously\nmisleading.\nThose who oppose Star Wars have\nalways believed that the proponents\nof it had less than wholesome\nmotives. But, they have always\nreplied that they were acting from the\nhighest moral considerations. If this\nwas true, then they wouldn't have to\nlie about the likely success of the\nprogramme.\nAny scientist who cares about\nscience or about the future of the\nhuman race, should do his best to\nprevent science from being hijacked\nby those who are engaged in fanatical\ncrusades. We will all suffer if they\ndon't. Green\ntea\nstops\ncancer\nWe have always known that coffee is\nbad for you in large quantities, and\nthere have always been some people\nwho argued that tea was better. Now\nwe have the definitive evidence: tea\nstops cancer.\nCaffeine is a natural insecticide that\nkills insects by making them\nhyperactive. Most students use the\nhigh caffeine content of coffee to help\nthem get through exams (but not\nmany seem to suffer the same fate as\nthe insects). Coffee is about 30-50%\ncaffeine, and the other chemicals are\nsimilar in type and taste but not as\ngood at killing bugs or keeping\nstudents awake. Tea is a much more\ncomplex mixture. The total amount\nof caffeine in it is similar to coffee,\nbut much of it is stuck to other large\nmolecules that only let go of it slowly,\ngiving your bloodstream a chance to\ncope with it and therefore not making\nyou hyperactive. Tea is superior to\ncoffee in other ways\u2014it has a much\nwider variety of chemicals in it for a start. One of these chemicals has just\nbeen shown to be a good inhibitor of\ncancer.\nThe chemical, e pig allocate ching al late (or EGCG for those who want to\navoid severe strain of the tongue),\noccurs in large quantities in green tea.\nSome Japanese scientists investigated\nit because people who drink green tea\nin Japan seem to have a lower cancer-rate than most Japanese. They\ndiscovered that the chemical is very\neffective in preventing tumours in\nmice (though how the mice were\npersuaded to drink tea I don't know)\nprobably because it sticks to some\ndelicate receptors on the cell surface\nthat are s usc ep table to attack by\ncarcinogens.\nThe only problem is this, there is\nvery little of the chemical in the black\ntea drunk in Britain, and British taste\nbuds are not about to be weaned onto\nthe green stuff. Anyway more and\nmore people prefer to drink coffee,\nwhich is mainly insecticide and\ncontains nothing useful for human\nhealth.\n8 Friday November 20th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "THE BARON! \u2022 miu ir ji c niu ji 'al\nIt was a rainy November afternoon in the land of Cheapskate. Derek Dash, the Baron, was preparing to take his wife, Mad Dash, out to dinner\nto celebrate her birthday. (Her birthday was in April, but she liked to celebrate it regularly). He was about to leave, when Ian Bore, the Baron's chief yes man and editor of the Cheapkate comic, Wetnerk, entered the room, furiously washing his hands with invisible soap.\n'Hello Bore', said the Baron. 'How are you getting on with the latest issue of WetNerk?'\n'Not very well, I'm afraid, Baron', said Bore. 'The citizens in the Phallix Office are still printing it; I don't think it will be ready for another month'.\n'We really must do something about Phallix, you know, Bore', said the Baron. 'Not only does Judith Largeamounts keep on printing anonymous\nletters, she says nasty things about Mad Dash all the time. And I really can't understand what any of the citizens have to complain about.\nI have made it clear that anyone who does not like Cheapskate should come and have tea with me to discuss the matter. I don't know why\nnobody has come to see me yet'.\n'Perhaps all the citizens prefer coffee, Baron', said Bore, trying to be helpful as usual.\n'Perhaps', agreed the Baron. 'Or perhaps they all think that Cheapskate is a very nice place really'.\nAt that moment, Arthur Michael, the good-but-good-for-nothing fairy, came into the room.\n'Hello, Piggy', said the Baron. 'How are things going in the rent collector's office?'\n'Well, we have some good news and some bad news', said Arthur Michael. 'The 'bad' news is that Cheapskate is going to lose 600 places\nin the Yorrick Gardens dormitories, and so most citizens who have been in Cheapskate for more than a year will have to sleep under benches\nin Seek Park'. Unable to control himself, Arthur Michael clapped his hands together in glee. 'Ahem...and the good news is that we're going\nto make sure that all the citizens from far away get a place in the dormitories we have left, and this will mean more money for Cheapskate'.\nThe thought of all this extra money was too much for Arthur Michael and Bore. They were so excited that they broke into song:\nOh, the grand old Baron of Cheapskate\nHe had five thousand citizens\nHe marched them up to the top of the cliff\nAnd pushed them off the edge\nHurray!\n'Be quiet, you two', said the Baron. 'But this is indeed good news. Now I will be able to make even more pompous speeches about how\nmarvellous things are in Cheapskate. I think I 'll call Whygate, the head citizen, and tell him the good news'.\nThe phone rang in the citizens' office just as Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks was zipping up Whygate in his new dress with sequins on it. Alan\nEgo, the deputy head citizen, was opening letters and filing them. Ego's filing system was very effective. He stamped all the letters with\nthe date, then screwed them up and put them in one of three waste paper baskets, labelled 'Bar', 'Snack Bar', and 'Lesley's Love Letters'.\nTakeiteasy, the citizen in charge of nothing very much, was asleep under a huge pile of invoices, cheques, and memos.\n'You'd better answer the phone, Ian, de a rie', said Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks.\n'Answer the phone, Ego!', said Whygate, after a pause.\n'Answer the phone, Takeiteasy!', said Ego, without looking up.\nAfter a few seconds, Takeiteasy emerged from beneath the pile of invoices and cheques. He looked around sleepily, and eventually the\nphone stopped ringing. Looking pleased with himself, Takeiteasy yawned went back to sleep.\n'Do you think I look okay, Jolly, de a rie?' said Whygate.\n'You look lovely, de a rie', said Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks. 'I'm sure you'll go down a storm at the burning concert. Now let's have some sherry!'\n'Oh no!', screamed Whygate.\n'What's the matter?', said Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks.\n'I think one of my sequins is out of place', wailed Whygate.\n'Don't worry, de a rie', said Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks. 'I'm sure it won't matter. You'll be a long way away from all the citizens when you\nget up on stage tonight. Anyway you're not likely to have your clothes on long enough for anyone to notice. But do remember to be careful\nwith your magic wand. Now don't forget you have to write a letter to John Secretary before you go'.\nMrs Jolly Hockey picked up a notebook and wrote as Whygate dictated.\n'Dear John', began Whygate. 'I think it was very sneaky of you to try to get your grubby hands on the money from Gravlington rocks\nto help pay off the Baron's huge debts. I am going to make sure that you never get even a glimpse of the cash, all of which is going to be\ninvested by myself. You were very lucky that I managed to convince all the citizens that I had brilliantly outmanoeuvred you. If the story\nhad got out that my \"three months of intensive research\" amounted to asking Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks where Gravlington was, I would have\nmade things very tough for you. Just remember-don't mess with Ian Whygate!'\n'Oh, that sounds very masterful, de a rie', said Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks. 'I'm sure John Secretary will get the message. Shall I send it over\nright away?'\n'Yes please, Jolly, de a rie', commanded Whygate. 'I'm going to see to my hair'.\nLater in the Baron's castle, John Secretary composed his reply. 'Dear Ian', he wrote, 'thank you so much for your admirable letter. It is\nso nice to receive correspondence which is so clear and to the point, as well as being so elegantly penned. However, I'm sure that the problem\nis not worth getting carved-up about'. John Secretary sharpened his carving knife and allowed himself a quiet chuckle as he wrote this. 'I think that this matter would be best solved over dinner sometime. You must come round to my place soon. How about tomorrow night?\nKind regards, John'.\n'This is impossible', moaned Whygate when he received the letter. 'I'm going out with Mad Dash tomorrow. You'll have to go, Ego!'\n'Bog off, Whygate', said Ego. 'I'm going out to get pissed tomorrow'.\n'Well in that case Takeiteasy will have to go to dinner with John Secretary', said Whygate, poking the slumbering heap with his magic wand....\nWhat is on the menu at John Secretary's tomorrow night?\nWill Takeiteasy wake up in time to go?\nAre Bore's hands clean yet?\nWhat does Whygate use his magic wand for?\nFind out in the next episode of 'The Baron of Cheapskate'.\nFELIX Friday November 20th19877 "
