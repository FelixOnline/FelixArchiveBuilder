    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 9TH MAY Marquee decision condemned by USC\nDAVID ROBERTS\nLast week's Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee (one of the key channels\nfor students to air the air grievances\nwith College) came down squarely\nagainst the examinations marquee in\nPrinces' Gardens as a long term solution to this year's exam chaos.\nRecognising the adverse problems\nof noise associated with the tent, they\nrecommended that any possible\nalternative location should be sought\nfor examinations in the last two\nweeks of term, when noise from the\nsurrounding halls is expected to\npeak. The plight of those sitting\nexaminations has now reached a wider audience with yesterday's edition of The Independent reporting on\nthe students fate.\nDespite complaints about noise\nlevels from biologists and biochemists who sat their exams in the\nGreat Hall in February, no changes\nto either the examinations or construction schedules were made,\nresulting in the last minute decision\nto erect the Tent taken in the final\nweek of the Easter holiday. Indeed,\nthe Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee felt that with the benefit\nof hindsight the decision to move to\nthe tent should never have been\ntaken in the first place, with exams\nremaining in the Great Hall if at all\nfeasible.\nThis mirrors the feelings of many\nstaff, including some department\nheads, that the decision has, by\nputting revenue and College prestige\nahead of student well-being, been a dangerous mistake. However, with\nthe tent now in place, and the exams\nalready having been moved once, the\nUSC fear that the possibility of\nreturning the last fortnight of exams\nto solid ground is very small.\nSuch a move would also (pre sum ably) jeo pardi se the chances of the\nlibrary extension being completed on\ntime - an outcome which Estates\nhave been at pains to avoid. Oddly\nenough, however, the Great Hall was\nquiet as a mouse on Thursday, whilst\nthe Prince's Gardens mobile-class-room was a hive of frenetic activity.\nThe recent re-adjustment of the work\nschedules on the main Bio-Medical\nSciences building site to allow contractors to complete an electrical fit\nout suggest that it would have been\npossible to re-arrange some work on\nthe smaller library site.\nMeanwhile, attempting to restrict\nthe levels of bias inflicted against\nthose sitting exams in the marquee,\nPHOTO: DAVID The decision to site this summer's exams in a marquee in Prince's Gardens has failed to amuse the\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee.\nDr Margaret Goodgame, one of the\nCollege Tutors, has been de put is ed to attend all examinations held in the\nstructure and note times of particular\ndisruption. In addition, dedicated\nnoise monitors are continually\nrecording levels, so that any complaints from students can be verified\nand quantified. If all these factors are\ntaken into consideration during\nassessment, then hopefully the detrimental effects to students can be kept\nto a bare minimum.\nComplaints regarding mal administration of the exams (the only criteria under which students may challenge their results) should be made to\nthe Imperial College Registry in the\nfirst instance.\nUnfortunately, Sherfield staff\nwere unable to confirm the total cost\nof this damage-control operation, in\naddition to the initial hire and installation of the Marquee, or to compare\nthis cost with the penalties which\nwould have been incurred by reorganising the building schedule.\nMike Hansen, College's Director of\nFinance, was unavailable for com-ment.\neditorial, page twenty three\nCLAY PONDS WARDEN\nThe College invites applications for the position of\nWarden Clayponds which is available from 1st September 1997. Clayponds is a residential development of houses and flats in Ealing. It houses 2nd,3 rd and 4th year undergraduates and postgraduates.\nWardens receive rent-free in return for pastoral\nduties within this \"student village\". The post is open\nto all non-undergraduate members of the College but\nexperience of pastoral care would be and advantage.\nFor further details and an application form contact\nJanet Jones, Office Services Manager, Room 512\nSherfield Building, extension 45536, e. mail\nJanet.Jones@ic.ac.uk\nThe closing date for receipt of applications is\nThursday Friday 30th May.\n\n"

    "content": "Hayfever remedies to b mak j jour heart?\nJessica. Sheringham reports on the recent findings of a link\\between heart attacks and Fia yj ever treatments\nAs the warm weather seems to be here to stay, (despite\nthe snow earlier this week!), we are entering the season\nof sunbathing, cut grass and, for the unfortunate,\nblocked noses and sneezing fits. As one of many\nhay fever sufferers, I am really thankful for current remedies like Triludan. However, a growing body of research\nsuggests that treatments like these might be lethal.\nDangers\nTerfenadine, the anti-histamine in many hay fever treat-ment s, has been linked to 20 deaths from fatal heart\nabnormalities since it was licensed for general use over\n14 years ago. From 1992, researchers have found that the\ndrug can be harmful for people suffering from liver com-plaints; these can prevent ter fe nadine from being\nmeta boli sed properly. A build-up of ter fe nadine in the\nbody can result in potentially lethal effects on the heart.\nAlso, some antibiotics can prevent ter fe nadine being\nmeta boli sed, leading to this same build-up. However, this\nmay not be too serious - ter fe nadine' s safety record is\nvery good when it taken as prescribed. The danger is only\nwhen the drug isn't used as it is supposed to be. Until\nnow, doctors have been able to warn patients about the\ndangers of mixing antibiotics which they prescribe, with\nhay fever treatments. But most recent studies indicate that\nter fe nadine' s interactions are not just with prescribed\ndrugs. Taking ter fe nadine even with grapefruit juice can\ncause heart problems.\nESSENTIALS\nTerfenadine is found in the following treatments:\nAller-Eze Clear Histafen Seldane\nBoots Antihistamine Terfinax Tablets\nTerfenor Triludan Forte\nTerfex Triludan\nBoots Hayfever Relief Antihistamine Tablets\nBoots One-a day Antihistamine Tablets\n\u2022It should not be used if you suffer from heart or\nliver complaints\n\u2022Don't exceed the recommended dose\n\u2022Don't take with grapefruit juice or some antibiotics, for example erythromycin.\n\u2022Ask a pharmacist if you are any doubt about continuing with ter fe nadine or about possible alternatives.( source:Boots Patient Information Leaflet)\nA minefield for hay fever sufferers\nAction\nAs a result of this, Professor Michael Rawlins, the\nChairman of the Governmenfs Committee on the Safety\nof Medicines declared that ter fe nadine \"was getting too\ncomplicated for pharmacy use\". He announced last week\nthat ter fe nadine containing treatments will be available\nonly on prescription.\nWhy use ter fe nadine? Terfenadine is one of the newer hay fever treatments.\nThese are more popular than older style drugs because\nthey are more effective and don't cause the sleepy side-effects associated with these older medications. Whilst\nother non-sedating hay fever treatments are available, ter-fe nadine is the main ingredient in many of the main\nremedies. Moreover, doctors Ralph Edwards and Marie\nLinquist reported in f he Lancet last week that various\nalternatives to ter fe nadine are also associated with a higher risk of death and of heart abnormalities.\nImplications for the hay fever sufferer\nFor most of us, the drug is quite safe, yet will still become\nprescription only. Could this mean that we are destined to\nspend a summer of runny noses or return to treatments\nwhich send you to sleep?\nThis will not be the case. The proposal to remove ter fe nadine from the pharmacy is subject to a three-month\nconsultation period. Only after this period will the drug be\nremoved from pharmacies and restricted to prescription.\nSo, we will still be able to get drugs like Triludan over the\ncounter this summer.\nSffW\n1086/11\n09059?\nthe go lem and other stones\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 9 TH MAY LETTERS & EDITORIAL 23\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nBig Top is here to stay\nDear Felix,\nI have just read the feature and letters in last weeks issue (1085)regard-ing the tent and I would like to say\nthat after having sat three exams\nalready with three still to go that I actually like the tent!\nI have found it the most pleasant\nand relaxing exam room I have ever\nsat in, it is certainly better than the\ntense atmosphere of the great hall\nlast year, I know this sounds a bit\nstrange but so far all the press about\nthe tent has been quite negative. My\nonly gripes are that the floor wobbles\nabout too much and there are no toilets otherwise I think that the college\nauthorities have for the first time\nsince I have been here made a sensible decision (although it has\noccurred due to a monumental cock-up on the part of Schal again).\nYours sincerely\nDamian Fell\nP.S. This is NOT a piss take.\nDear Felix,\nIn response to many letters of\ncomplaint that you have received\nrecently, I feel urged to let my feelings known. I refer mainly to the tent\nscenario in Prince's Gardens.\nI am lucky enough not to be affected by this piss-take, but it still annoys\nme that my fellow students have to\nsuffer at the hands of this Caldwell\ncharacter. All he seems to do in his\njob is mess things up and then make\nlame excuses. Why is someone, who\nis obviously so unsuited to a job that\ninvolves the use of the brain, allowed\nto make decisions that affect so\nmany people? Who is this fool? Why\nis he still in his job? Why is he being\nlet off scot-free after annoying so\nmany? Why has he not at the least,\nbeen bombarded with eggs, or such\nlike? At less subdued Universities he\nwould have many such un pie as an tries bestowed upon him. Why do\nwe stand for this?\nThis is not a call to arms, but a stab\nat the apathy of IC students. Come\non we cannot all be that busy. Look\nat the recent events in Trafalgar\nSquare for example. The Reclaim the\nStreets people made their point perfectly as \"the youths danced on the\nsteps of the National Gallery.\" (OK,\nso a few anarchists and very heavy\nhanded police spoilt the scene on the\nother side of the square. Trust the\nPolice to bring horses and riot gear to\na party! ) This is what can be done\nwith a bit of bravado.\nThere have also been letters mentioning the prospective move to PG\nstudies only at IC. These rumours\nhave been flying around since I got\nto this College, but they will do it if\nwe just sit back and let them. A bit of\ngrief every now and then would\nmake them think twice about shitting\non us as often as they do.\nWhatever happened to: \"Don't let\nthe buggers get you down!?\"\nNeil Forsyth (EE4)\nDemocracy?\nDear Alex,\nI would like to express my disappointment at the lack of publicity\nconcerning the posting of papers for\nthe forthcoming ICU Presidential\nElections. Most students at Imperial,\neven those interested in the Union,\nhave no idea that the re-run ballot is\ndue to take place in just over a week.\nFollowing the debacle of the\nMarch elections, I had hoped that the\nposting of nomination papers would\nhave been widely promoted with a view to encouraging as diverse a group of students to stand as p ossi ble. As far as I can work out one\nsmall notice was placed in Felix, no\nposters on the walkway, no letters to\nFelix inviting candidates to stand, no\nbanners across the front of the Union\nBuilding etc.\nWhile the dearth of information\nfollowing the posting of nomination\npapers may be contrary to the spirit\nof the Union's Constitution, section\n2.1.1 of Appendix D( Election\nProcedures) explicitly states that\n\"The opening of nominations shall\nbe publicised at least five College\ndays in advance.\" I believe that this\ndid not happen and that consequently the election scheduled for 19th and 20th May is unconstitutional and\nshould be postponed with nominations being re-opened, this time in\naccordance with both the spirit and\nthe letter of the law.\nThere is still plenty of time for\nnomination papers to be posted\nagain, allowing all IC students their\ndemocratic right to stand for ele c tion. The Annual General Meeting of\nthe Union this Friday would seem an\nideal opportunity for such an\nannouncement.\nYours sincerely,\nBen Weir\n^ fff ELIX\nStudent Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\nLetters may edited for content or length. The deadline for letters to\nbe published in the next issue of Felix is Tuesday 13th May. Letters\nmay be e mailed to our address: felix@ic.ac.uk\nOpinion over the virtue of IC's latest\nforay into the temporary-rigid-sided-marquee construction industry is\ndivided!\nOn one hand we have the likes of\nDamian Fell (left) applauding this al\nfresco examination event, even\ngoing to such lengths as to assur re us\nthat his adulation is not the object of\na deranged mind or a bar-room jape.\nOn the other, we have the rest of the\nstudents arraigned against the Big\nTop at the centre of Imperial's Prince's Gardens folly convinced\nthat the most important tests of their\nlives are of secondary importance to\nthe individual considerations of the\nmembers of the Administrative\nBloc.\nWhile it would be foolish to suggest that this is another in a long line\nof measures designed to gradually\nphase out undergraduate teaching as\nNeil Forsyth has done in his letter\n(left), I think that Imperial College's priorities have become muddled,\nand not for the first time. The bizarre\nand opaque workings of the\nSherfield administration over this\nmatter became a little clearer last\nweek when the Undergraduate\nStudies Committee more-or-less laid\nthe blame for this fiasco at the door\nof the Estates Division.\nAs the Committee found out,\nEstates have known about the noise\nproblem in the Great Hall for some\ntime but faced with the enormous\ntask of deciding whether or not to\nhave a break in the Library works\nschedule (their own responsibility)\nor brusquely expecting that the\nexams would be moved (not Estate's responsibility but that of another\ndivision, the Registry), they prevaricated and vacillated before plumping for the latter, the financially\ncheaper option.\nAn earlier and much cheaper resolution could have been found. For\nexample, Schal have demonstrated\nthat rescheduling of work to meet\ndeadlines is not impossible with\ntheir recent electrical work on the\nBMS site. Instead we have a sort of\ncowardice akin to that of a child\nwhom has scratched an expensive\ntable but, instead of owning up, covers the mark and blames the dog\nwhen found out later. Is this really\nthe way that a university and an\nemblem of international excellence\nthat expects respect should be run?\nIt is easy to mark out the Estates\nDivision for criticism, but the real\nproblem that should be addressed is\nmore fun de mental. The recurrent theme among this\nand other recent upsets and 'mis-understandings' is a distinct lack of\ncommunication between the various\ndepartments, divisions and cliques\nthat comprise the administration side\nof things at this College, and the\nconsumers of these services, namely\nthe students and staff.\nThis is not a blanket criticism;\nmostly things work smoothly and all\nis well, but sometimes it all falls\ndown, despite the best of recent\nefforts to publicise decisions. This is\nperhaps most neatly illustrated by\nwhat happened to an inquisitive\ncolumnist from The Independent\nwho sought some information about\nthe exam-no is c tent business. He\nphoned the Press Office hoping to be\nenlightened but was disappointed\nwith the reply from a rather surprised employee who was able only\nto \"make enquiries and call him\nback.\"\nLet's have some transparency in\nthe government of Imperial College.\nLet us, the consumers, see who\nmakes which decisions, what they\nare and why and when they are\nmade. For this current situation\nthough, a workable solution to the\nexam-noise-tent dilemma acceptable\nto all involved would (and should)\nhave been found in time. The last\nminute fudge we have will have to\ndo for now, but has done nothing to\nlift the gloom that the students (and\na lot of staff I 'll warrant) feel about\nbeing secondary or perhaps tertiary\nconsiderations in their own College.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

That sort of mystery and profundity\nis really what life is about.\nSo you see pure science as something like art?\nYes, but you cannot really use that as a very\neffective motivation for funding - unless the fun-der s themselves are moved by that spirit....\nScience in general and Physics in particular are\nportrayed in a bad light nowadays. What are\nthe moral obligations and concerns when doing\nresearch?\nScientists do have responsibilities but I do not\nthink they are that much more than anybody else's in society. Anyone who votes or is in any way a member of society, has responsibilities. One of the\nmoral concerns people working in universities\nhave is the 'unexpected bad uses' of their work.\nIf, for example I was offered a grant, some vast\nsum of money to work, on a 'graviton bomb' or\nsomething like that, I would not do it although it is\nnot obvious that all military research is bad, after\nall the Nation has had to defend itself at times.\nPeople of my generation missed the Manhattan\nProject [the dev elopement of teh first atom bomb].\nIf I was twenty years older I might have been\ninvolved. With hindsight everyone says 'no I wouldn't have done it' but of course they did not\nknow at the time, the problem is simply knowing...\nThere is hindsight now though, after the\nManhattan project.\nThat is right, there is now about the role of things\nlike Nuclear Physics and people working in those\nfields are very conscious but as far as my field is\nconcerned you have to get really science-fiction ary about it, people talk about creating new universes\nin the lab and this sort of thing, I do not know if I would do it...\nI would\nYou would? But you see the effects could be cat-as troph ic...( laughs), generally in theoretical\nphysics we are not faced with such decisions. Even\nif you think very hard about it, it is difficult to see\nhow one could use our research in any practical\nway good or bad.\nWhat is a 'Theory of Everything' and what\ndoes it have to do with Quantum Gravity?\nWhen people talk about theories of everything or\nGrand Unified Theories (GUTs) they tend to refer\nto two different things: One side is the actual literal unification of forces: an attempt to find an over-arching set of equations which in some way\ndescribes all of the known forces as different facets\nof the same thing. The other side is the theories that\ntry to explain the origin of the universe. Quantum\nGravity, a theory that will combine Quantum\nMechanics and General Relativity, is expected to\nbe involved in both of those, because a GUT will\nhave to include the gravitational force in some\nway.\nPrevious revolutions in Physics have radically\nchanged the world. What will be the impact of\nsuch a theory on the average scientist or even on\nthe person in the street?\nThis will depend very much on how they evolve.\nIt is possible that a GUT will be constructed out of\nthe existing framework of Quantum Theory and\nRelativity, when it will be seen as a very comp li "

John Squire's new\nband has surfaced after nearly a year of press\nspeculation and gossip.

To\naccompany the release, there was a short but\nsweet English tour and you can read a review\nLIVE......... this time the techs weren't leaving anything to\nchance, evident in the amount of time they\nspent actually spent selling up.

Every\ntime he launched into a solo, you could hardly\nhear it for all the screaming.\nAfter an encore with the ridiculously-titled Kill\nPussycat Kill, they left, leaving the crowd knowing two things Firstly, that the Seahorses would\nagain and secondly thai John Squire is back\nand he means to stay.\nAlok\nMonday 12th May Reef + Cable, \u00a311.\nBrixton Academy\nTuesday 13th May Cake + support, \u00a37.50\nCamden Dingwalls, NW1.\nWeds 14th May Supergrass, \u00a311.\nBrixton Academy\nThursday 15th May Brand New Heavies, \u00a39.50\nForum, Kentish Town\nof it below.

You wouldn't go far wrong in citing\nGold Blade as primary evidence for this proposition. On stage at the scum hole that is the\nNew Cross Venue they exude passion, spraying the audience with with it like gob bets of\nfreshly congealed kebab fat. Invective leaps\nfrom lead singer John Robb's lips as he hectors\nus to feel the soul power moving through him\nand his com padres. These six men, variously\nfrom London, Manchester and the birthplace of\nrock and roll, Blackpool, are preaching a gospel all wrapped up in ^\nthree chord punk. They\nremind me of Reverend\nHortin Heat or Rocket\nFrom the Crypt, all\nshout y, be qu if fed upstarts who sound like\nthey picked a guitar up\nfor the first time just five\nminutes before the show, and are still\nawestruck with its potential to cause sonic\nmale vo lance. But here comes the trick. Gold\nBlade have an added element, the philosophers of stone pop: STAR ATTITUDE. They really\nbelieve that they can change the world, one\nshitty venue at a time and, for a while, I am\nalmost convinced. As John flies around the\nstage, face contorted and singing tunes about\nBlack Elvis, their power is undeniable. And Yet,\neven with top notch tunes like Strictly Hardcore,\nwhich obviously has themselves hoarse on the\nchorus, it all too quickly descends into Blues\nBrothers parody. All the rock and roll clich es are there, from the gold lame to the guitarist\nclambering atop the speaker stack (only to\nhave real problems getting down again -wuss).\nUltimately, there must be a caveat to our initial proposition. Certainly, music without passion is worthless. Almost as bad as passion\nwithout an iota of musical talent or innovation.\nA perfect description of Gold Blade, really.\nNorm\n\n"

This is\nthe second time the Presidential election has been run after the first saw a massive vote to re-open nominations\nover the candidature of third year\nchemist Samantha Baker.\nThis time round there are three\ncandidates standing. They are Clare\nBuston of Biology and Management,\nAl Hussein, a third year from the\nPhysics Department and Oily\nNewman currently the City & Guilds\nUnion Academic Affairs Officer.\nDespite widespread rumours, last\nminute entries of \"heavyweight\"\ncandidates failed to materialise.

The trio will\nthen take the arduous trip across\nHyde Park to face the students of St\nMary's the following day. A good\nshowing there is vital to win the predictable but lucrative block vote that\nthe herd like medics will almost certainly bestow.\nFor the first time, Charing Cross &\nWestminster Medical School will\nwitness a hustings on Friday 16th May, however since students there\ncannot vote this time round, this will\nbe an exercise to give the School a flavour of Imperial College Union's great democratic system.

One of\nLabour's election campaign promises was to make education a 'top pri-or it y', and with their huge majority\nof 179, all those concerned in education expect New Labour to deliver.\nSince Tony Blair took up the reins\nas Prime Minister, he has appointed\nDavid Blunkett as Secretary of State\nfor Employment and Education and\ntwo other educational Ministers of\nState; Stephen Byers with special\nresponsibility for Schools and\nBaroness Blackstone with special\nresponsibility for Further and Higher\neducation. The Department for\nEmployment and Education has said\nthat so far no official decisions on\neducation have been made but the\nintentions are in line with those laid\nout in the manifesto. David Blunkett\nhas, however, expressed a wish to\npass a short bill through Parliament\nto prevent expenditure on assisted\nplaces in private schools from\nSeptember 1998 in order to release\nmoney to be used in areas such as the\nreduction of class sizes.\nThe education section of the\nLabour Manifesto focused on primary and secondary education. The\nmore notable plans include the abolition of the nursery voucher scheme\nfrom which the money saved will be\nused to ensure nursery places for 4\nyear olds, an undertaking to reduce\nclass sizes for 5 to 7 year olds, and a commitment to improve standards in\nprimary schools and the teaching of\nthe three \"r's\".

This sort of\ndeclaration can only do wonders for any new\nband, coming from the man who brought us\n-as Ride, Primal Scream, Teenage Faridub. ..\nPure starts this debut off with its swooning\n\u2022 . .\u2022\n\u2022\nattack the social Ills affecting many of us with <\ncrowd rallying passionate aggression while at\nAFTERTASTE\nHelmet\nPage Hamilton, vocalist, lead guitarist and\nmainstay of New York hardcore heroes Helmet,\nis a living example of Jekyll and Hyde. Talk to\nhim for a while and you'll be impressed by his\nart icu lacy and mild manners. Heck, the man\neven loves jazz. Give him a guitar, on the other\nhand, and an angry, brutal music-creating\nmonster smashes its way out of that hitherto\ncalm exterior.\nWhich is a relief, because after three albums\nand considerably fewer record sales than the\nlikes of In The Meantime merited, we might\nhave expected Helmet to tone down their savagery to garner some commercial appeal. Not\na bit of it. After a few seconds of superfluous\nfeedback, Pure launches itself from the speakers with one of those crunching guitar riffs that\nhave influenced everyone from Therapy? (definitely) to Sepultura (probably). But don't think for\none minute that this is crass, tuneless music.\nPure, like virtually everything else that follows, is\ndeceptively melodic amongst its barrage of\nnoise and thunder. In fact, in the likes of Exactly\nWhat You Wanted and the sublime It's Easy To\nGet Bored ifs the TUNES that bang you around\nthe head before anything else, leaving you\ngaping at how someone can write something\nso heavy yet so hum mable. Meanwhile,\nHamilton is busy s pir ting out diatribes against\nall and sundry with some of the best put-downs you'll find anywhere. Listen to ones such\nas, \"I'd rather be insulted by you than someone\nawaited love of \\ha\\-\u00a3d pper Girl. The\nTinsJejown image of the world gets a thrashing\n\\a Jhis Is My Hollywood where they attack the\nfalseness of Ihe whole affair.\nDistorted guitars crash on, underplaying the\ntypically punk, all members of f he band shouting along, rebel rou sir jg songs: that build up\nthis album. Many of the songs contain fantastic guitar, riffs that only pick up near their end\nis\nJason\nI respect' {Birth Defectl and \"You speak the language everyone knows/Take over when the\nconversation slows/Another self-made lumi-nary/Or maybe just the f****** tooth fairy/I'd send the brain you ration/To feed the smallest\nstarving nation\" [DietAftertaste) and that Jekyll\nand Hyde comparison becomes all the more\nobvious.\nUltimately then, Helmets fourth proper\nalbum is a potent cocktail of sterling guitars,\nclever lyrics and some surprisingly wondrous\ntunes. Try it and rest assured that you'll be left\nwith anything but a bitter 'Aftertaste'...(7)\nVik\nAFTER AFTER HOURS\nSugar Plant\nTo borrow a footballing clich e, this Japanese\nduo's latest release is a record of two halves.\nThe first half you're awake, the second you're\nnot. No great loss, since there is such little variation between any of the tracks, although, like\nthe white noise on the telly after Cell Block H, the finale [Brazil) wakes you up just enough so\nthat you don't forget to get undressed and turn\noff the lights.\nThe mood is very dreamy, but the sound is\nsub-ambient, like Stereolab with the brakes on\nand no progression in the tunes. Come to that,\nthere are few actual \"tunes\" at all. The repetitive\nnature of the album extends to the lyrics, where\nthe same line is echoed again and again. Ifs\nalmost as if Sugar Plant are constrained by the\nstrict form of Japanese poetry, since none of\nLET THE FREAK FLAG FLY\nTranquillity Bass\nthe songs stretch to 4 verses. This is a shame\nbecause the poems that they have produced\nhave great entertainment value. It is very difficult not to laugh at someone who sings, with a straight face, \"She loves the sun on free zy moon/ Too many empties to feel in peace\".\nThis is harsh though, and it is cheap to poke\nfun like that. In fact, the better songs on the\nalbum - Here Rain Comes and Drifting - have\nthe greatest vocal contributions.\nThe band are trying to be too clever with this\nrecord, with the result that it is devoid of\nhumour. However, this is where the album\nfails, since After After Hours is an un demand ing, easy listen. From the intro to many of the\ntracks, one half expects some old crooner from\nthe easy listening hall of fame to let rip. Nothing\non this album comes near a noteworthy event\nlike that. Throughout the record you get that\nstrange feeling that something is missing- a manic breakbeat, or killer riff, say....(4)\nMagic Tom\nWith Let The Freak Flag Fly, Tranquility Bass\nhave produced a hippy album for the nineties\nwith all the old school dreamin ess of the six-ties. The result is pretty good, apart from the\nodd change in style which spoils the overall\neffect.\nThe album starts off promisingly enough\nwith the drug gy Five Miles High and is followed by the equally promising La La La. A change in style then gives us the surprisingly\ndreamy tones of brass in The Bird, but the\nchange in style that follows this is almost as\nunforgivable as David Bowie's recent drum\nand bass outing. Soldier's Sweetheart is the\ntitle of this undeniably sinful track, which is\nmore country than hippy free-form as the\nsleeve notes suggest. Thankfully the album\nmoves back to the hippy theme with We All\nWant To Be Free - a slow chanting song that\ndrags its heels, and leaves the listener waiting for a crescendo that never comes. The\npace picks up with Never Gonna End, and the\nresult sits pretty as one of the stand out tracks\non the album, along with /'// Be Here which\ntakes more than simple influence from the\nButthole Surfers Hurdy GurdyMan\nwith the wobbling vocal effect. The\ntitle track follows in ultra-hippy style\nand the sound is certainty interesting j and innovative if not wholly imp res sive. As the album draws to a close\nTranquillity Bass return to the country style\nwith Lichen Me To Wyomin, and the less said\nabout that the better.\nOverall a very listenable album that would\nimprove endlessly if two tracks were\nremoved.(6)\nJames\n1\n3\nraw?\nmusic\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 9 TH MAY COLUMNS 21\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\n$t1I expect Tony Blair woke up on\nFriday or Saturday morning with a very wide grin on his face. Although\nfew people were surprised by the\nLabour victory, the scale of it has\ncome as a shock to even the most\noptimistic Labour supporter.\nLabour have 419 of the 659 seats\navailable in the House of Commons,\ngiving them an extremely comfortable majority of 179 seats. Even if\npublic opinion swung some way\nagainst them in the next five years,\nthey could still win a working majority for a second term in Government.\nThe Conservatives, for their part, are\nresigned to perhaps ten years in\nOpposition, and there are predictions\nthat they may tear themselves to\npieces over Europe, in the same way\nthey did over the Corn Laws in the\n19th Century, keeping them out of\npower for generations.\nThey scale of Labour's majority\nhas had some unforeseen consequences for the Labour hierarchy,\nwith Labour MPs returned in seats\nthat they had not expected to win.\nSuch MPs include John McDonnell,\nwho supports Sinn Fein over the\nSDLP and lists his hobbies to include\n\".. .fermenting the overthrow of cap-it al is m\". Some of the reporting of\nthis problem has been exaggerated:\npoliticians are always more extreme\nin there views within the party and\nwithin their peer-group, but the effect\nof arriving at Parliament generally\nmoderates their views. However,\nthey could well spell trouble in the\nfuture for Blair's government.\nAs most people know, John Major\nannounced his resignation as Party\nLeader on his final departure from 10\nDowning Street. He will continue as\nLeader of the Opposition until a new\nleader can be elected. This will take\nsome time, however, since first he\nmust set up an Opposition front\nbench of 70 shadow ministers. From\nthe remaining 90 or so backbencher s, a new '1922' committee must be\nelected (the majority of the last one,\nincluding the chairman, Sir Marcus\nFox, lost their seats). When that is\ndone, the committee will then organise the leadership contest. All this\nwill happen in a matter of months, so\nthey can unite and form a proper\nOpposition.\nThe choice of leader will be the\naspect that may tear them apart.\nMany right-wing grandees lost seats,\nleaving old left-wingers in the majority at the top, but the new\nConservative MPs (not that there are\nmany of them) have a majority of\nright-wingers. So far Ken Clarke has\nannounced his candidature, with\nPeter Lilley, Michael Howard,\nWilliam Hague and Stephen Dorrell\nwaiting in the wings. Michael\nHeseltine ruled himself out due to ill\nhealth. To many people this motley\ncollection may sound like a freak\nshow, and many Tories are quietly\nshaking their heads with sorrow at\nthe quality of the candidates. Ken\nClarke's pro-European views leave a bad taste in the mouth for too many\nTories too stand a chance, and\nMichael Howard, although a strong\nperformer in debates, is generally\ndespised by the public at large. They\nmay choose William Hague, who at\n36, is young enough to skip a generation and provide an experienced but\nnot too elderly opponent in a future\nGeneral Election.\nWhatever happens, they will all\nhave to wonder just why they lost so\nappallingly, what the new\nGovernment is likely to achieve, and\ntry to choose a sensible path. It is\npossible that they may need to reinvent themselves like Blair reinvented\nthe Labour party. Most of the public\nwould welcome the change.\nYou'll have to forgive me if I seem a little hesitant this week. It's this\nOpposition lark, you see, all new to\nme. I have never before experienced\na Conservative election defeat, and\nmy political memory stretches back\nno further than the glorious day in\n1979 when Lady Thatcher stormed\nto power. The General Election was\nnot a defeat, not even a landslide. I'm afraid it was a political earthquake\nthat broke the Richter Scale. As I sat\nthere in the wee small hours, I was\nutterly gob smacked. The scale of the\npounding was beyond anyone's expectation. Seats that have been\nblue since Noah was doing the\nrounds fell to Labour or the Lib\nDems. Disbelief doesn't even begin\nto describe it. Still, it was nice to be\nconsoled by all my political soul-mates here on Friday. Not.\nThe reasons for our defeat, if young\nMr Weir will permit me to elaborate,\nare numerous, and I think that,\nalthough in the final analysis victory\nlooked less than certain, we could\nhave minimise d the damage. The one\nreason that would have been difficult\nto change was the wish for a change\nand the general 'fed up with the\nTories' attitude.\nThe desire for change lead to some\nof the most successful and widespread tactical voting ever seen in\nthis country. As those of you who\nwatched the BBC's exceptionally\ngood coverage will remember, the\nswing to Lib Dem in Labour targets\nSimon\nwas small and vice versa for Lib\nDem battlegrounds, maxim ising the\nscale of the defeat. Given that any\ngovernment is bound to make the\nodd mistake, it is therefore obvious\nthat the longer you are in govern-ment, the more errors you rack up\nand the easier\nit is for your\nopponents to\ncapital is e on it\nand the need\nfor change.\nThough the\nConservatives\nhad some very\ngood manifesto ideas -reform of the\nstate pension\n(almost certainly to be\nimplemented\nby Harriet\nHarmen and\nFrank Field\nand transfer of\ntax allowances from un work ing spouses to\nname but two-this alone\ncould not be\nenough. Party\nunity, or the lack of, was a major factor in the defeat. The old maxim that\ndivided parties don't get elected was\nvindicated. Given the shift in the\nparty, we should have presented a Eurosceptic front, but a coherent one.\nEuroscepticism, to my mind, does\nnot mean pull out of the EU, but\nrather strengthen and reform the core\ninstitutions of the Union, not least the\nSingle market, rather than march\nheadlong into monetary union, the\nenabling step\nBaker for p \u00b0 utica in ion, but\n| that's another\narticle. As it\nwas, there was\nso much\nsquabbling that little time\nwas left camp ai g ning. Which brings\nme to sleaze.\nVoice of Reason\nThe exasperation that I have\nfelt about this\n| can be second\nonly to John\nMajor. I have\nargued in private on\nnumerous occasions that,\nin the absence\nof mechanism\nfor Central\nOffice to\nremove a local candidate, Neil\nHamilton should be shot. His presence did so much to distract the\nmedia and public, totally negating\nthe extra length of the campaign. The\nBritish Parliament is by far the clean-est, most honourable legislative body\nin the world, and to let it be tarnished\nby the likes of him, bereft of any\nsense of honour and decency, is saddening to say the least. As most MPs\nwill agree, I'm sure, people like him\nare present in near negligible numbers in the House, but succeed in tarring all with the same brush. People\nlike Mr Hamilton should realise that\nthe job of an MP is not to serve him\nself or even his party, but to serve his\nconstituents and his country.\nStill, cometh the hour, cometh the\nman. The Conservatives will regroup\nunder a new leader (my money's on\nHague or Redwood) and will be\nback. After the 1945 landslide,\nLabour managed only one term. I 'll\ngive them a few weeks to settle in\nbefore passing judgement. It would\nbe churlish of me to hope they screw\nthe country up merely to prove me\nright, but let's wait and see. Lest you\nthink I forgot, space has denied me\nthe chance to reply to Ashton\nMcGregor's article. Full marks for\nputting the other side, but let me say\ntwo things. Firstly, you are wrong on\nseveral points, and I shall respond in\ndue course. Secondly, I shall not be\nbolstering my argument with cheap\npersonal insults, as you predicted.\nAnd finally, the cost of standing\ndown Schal is \u00a3200,000 not\n\u00a33,200,000, a figure arrived at when\nemail savaged my pounds signs\nHonest, Mr Caldwell.\n\n"

They then\ncommenced talks with the receivers\nand made a successful offer for what\nremained of ABA. It soon became\napparent that A BA's difficulties\nstarted almost from the day they\nmoved into their Walkway site.\nCallprint are looking to re-hire\nthose staff made redundant by\nABA's closure and have already\nreinstated some, including the shop's former manager. The prices for the\nservices offered by the shop and the\nconcessions available to students,\nvarious clubs and departments will\nremain fixed until all parties involved\nhave had the opportunity to discuss\nthe matter.\nThe company have indicated their\nintent to work in conjunction with\nImperial College Union to arrange\ndiscounts for individual students as\nwell as for College in general.\nStressing this, Mr Krangel said \"We\nbelieve close links with the students\nare essential if the venture is to be a success.\" He also talked of\nCallprint's wish to establish a second\nunit on the South Kensington cam-pus, catering solely for academic\ndepartments in College.\nDr James Bayley, Imperial\nCollege's Procurement Systems\nOfficer, appeared to be unaware of\nCallprint's future plans \"We intend\nto allow Callprint to run the shop for\nthe duration of their one month con-tract, after this we will be inviting\ncertain companies, like Xerox and\nKodak to bid for the tender.\"\nABA originally won the contract\nbecause of their willingness to provide a cost per copy contract, which\nnone of the larger re pro graphics companies would offer at that time.\nThe College has also been investing\nin the development of a software\npackage to relay print jobs to network printers, which has generated a considerable amount of commercial\ninterest. The software developers\nhoped to integrate ABA's operation\ninto the College network and use\ntheir business as a 'dry-run' for their\nnew software. This project will have\nto be abandoned if one of the larger\ncompanies, who already have adequate software packages, win the ten-der.\nAlthough Callprint specialise in\nlarge format and digital work for\nlarge companies they maintain that\nthey can still offer a high quality of\nservice to the College. Mr Krangel\nexpressed Callprint's desire to greatly increase the level of management\nin the shop and expand their premises on campus to offer an improved\nstandard and variety of service for all\ncustomers. This would prove a viable\npossibility only if they substantially\nincrease their prices and will not happen immediately due to the short\nterm nature of Callprint's existing\ncontract.\nCallprint's Mr Krangel appeared\noptimistic for the future \"We believe\nin caring about people.

But no! Not yet anyway, as Imperial\nCollege Union hasn't got a new President!\nSo, this is where you come in... even if you didn't vote, don't play football\nand loathe Albert Square, you now have the chance to influence the running of your Student Union. What a to do! Yes indeed. As some of you may remember, we've been through this one before, but as the\nresult was inconclusive a new election with fresh, sleaze-free candidates has been called. This\ntime the ballot will take place on the 19th and 20th of May. Here, to help you in that oh-so-diff ic irl t choice, the candidates tell you what they are going to do if they get elected.\nThe candidates speak\nAs Union President I will use all of my\nskills to ensure that the successful running of the Union is maintained and\nthat your needs are voiced via first class\nrepresentation.\nThe University is continually undergoing change and I will strive to\nensure that the welfare of students is at\nthe forefront of impending plans and\nare not just financial gains for the\nCollege.\nThe merger is a very important issue\nand I intend to see that thorough preparations are made so that the interests of\nboth existing IC students and those\nfrom the medical schools are protected\nand promoted further. This will involve\nissues such as providing adequate\nrecreational facilities, accommodation\nand ensuring that the Union's level of\nfunding isn't cut.\nI would strongly advise you to vote,\nhowever as I am slightly biased, vote\nfor me!\nTherefore all that remains for me to\nsay is that as YOU make up the Union,\nit is important to register your opinion.\nWhy vote for me? Because I will do\neverything I can to ensure that the\nUnion's commitment to students keeps\non expanding.\nFirst of all, I believe that student welfare is the most important issue as far as\nthe Union is concerned, and that ICU\nshould do everything in its power to\nsafeguard this at all times. We should\ndemand greater respect from College\nfor its students' well-being, and also for\nthe Union itself. In particular, I will\nClare Bunstan Al Hussein\nMy mission is to develop the human\nside of Imperial College Union. I'm fed\nup seeing so many people thinking the\nUnion is irrelevant. So much more\ncould be done to improve the way we\nlook after our members. Here's a summary of the big deal....\nRepresentation for all: I will create\na representation system able to listen\nwith interest, treat all with respect, and\nhave confidence in consensus opinions.\nRespect for clubs: Improved under-standing, support and co-operation;\nsafety reforms and de legislation. Thinking big: We should be more\npro-active: facing problems head-on.\nWe must not be scared to have our own\nideas (taking an interest in student\nfunding reforms etc). No nonsense: I will reduce the amount of bullshit that\ngets discussed and focus on real issues\nat Imperial (opposing profit motivated\nanti-student measures like exams in\ntents)\nfight for the Union's right to obtain\nmore space in Beit Quad after Biology\nmoves out.\nI will encourage a more vers it ile ents\nprogramme by including more specialist music nights and band nights during\nthe week. I will push hard to get a licence enabling us to hire recognised\nbands to play here, thus increasing revenue for the Union and establishing\nICU as a popular music venue.\nWith the impending arrival of St\nMary's,I will do everything in my\npower, working with other Union sab-bat ical s, to ensure that their integration\nis as smooth as possible.\nI believe that I am a suitable candidate because I know that I can do the\njob, and because I really do give a damn. I can make only one election\npromise: if you vote for me, you won't regret it.\nWho am I? The most experienced\nrepresentative at IC (AAO, Department\nand Year Rep). Expedition leader and\nFellwanderers President. Leading\nopponent of annoying clubs with silly\nrules. Member of umpteen IC and ICU\ncommittees. I'm motivated, organised\nand keen for a big challenge.\nChoose progress. Trust me.\nAs we enter the second bout of\nSabbatical elections, it has become my\nmisfortune to take on the duty of standing on behalf of New Election. I'm hoping that this campaign will not be as\nsuccessful as the New Election campaign during the last round of elections,\nbecause then we'd have to go through\nall this palaver again.\nFor those of you who don't know, a vote for New Election is a vote to reopen nominations for the position of\nImperial College Union President.\nBasically if you don't think that the\ncandidates standing in this elections are\ngood enough/pretty enough/smart\nenough to be President of your Union\nthen vote for New Election.\nAll you need to do is get a Union card,\nso that you can vote, and then write a large number 1 in the box next to New\nElection on your ballot paper. It's as\neasy as that.\nHustings: 6pm Tuesday 13th dBs St 6pm Weds 14th St Mary's Voting in all departments (more-or-less) 19th and 20th May.\nFelix recommends you attend the Hustings.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 9 TH MAY INTERVIEW 7\ncate d use of Quantum Mechanics and General\nRelativity. But of course it could be that we will\nhave to change either or both theories very radical-ly, i.e. change our concepts about space and time\nand change the very nature of Quantum Mechanics\nin very dramatic ways.\nHowever, it is hard to see how it will be of\n'everyday use' since even today we still use\nNewtonian rather than Relativistic physics to calculate orbits etc. So in that sense I guess, unless\nsomething totally unexpected happens these theo\nlies if they ever get developed will not have a totally overwhelming effect, but you never can\ntell!\nSo why all the fuss then since present theories work well on most practical scales?\nThe reason it excites people so much is that\nit is so difficult to do it. If you take General\nRelativity and Quantum Mechanics and try to\nput them together, they clash horribly mathematically and you get a whole mess of mathematical non-sense out of them. Quantum\nGravity will force people to think about fundamental issues of space and time that you normally sweep under the carpet so it is in this\nsense that there is a clash in the very heart of\nthese two subjects, people do feel that something very very deep is going on here.\nFundamental issues of space and time are\nintimately related to the very concept of\n'reality'. If 'reality' is challenged how do\nyou go about doing research and are the\nanswers you get something like 42?\nYou can tackle these things in different\nways. One way, at a purely empirical level,\nyou can simply go and develop a mathematical\nframework that seems to describe a phenomenon\nrather well, in a clear clean-cut mathematical way\nand then you can go on and attempt to hang a philosophical framework about the theory.\nAnother way is to start with a conceptual revolution. Traditionally in theoretical science you\nhave three things to think about: there is the mathematical framework itself, you have the conceptual framework attached to it, then you have the actual raw data. These three things intertwine and the\nart of the game is to fit the theory and the philosophy together in such a way that the philosophy\nmakes coherent sense of what is going on yet at the\nsame time the theory also describes the data. The\nproblem with Quantum Gravity, is the total lack of\ndata. So in that regard this area of research is\nunlike any other branch of science. Work in these\nareas proceeds in rather curious ways by either\nsearching for internal consistency in the theory or\nby adopting a pre-conceived philosophical scheme\nand taking it from there.\nSo the problem is deeper than just better experiments? The trouble is it is all very circular, because until\nyou have the theory in the first place, you do not\nknow what it will predict, so it might be that you\nand I sitting here at the moment is a prediction of\nquantum gravity but we do not know that.\nWe assume that the quantities known as the\nPlanck length (l Cf^ cm) and time ( lO\"^ Sec) will\nappear in a Quantum Theory of Gravity. They are\nincredibly small distances and times so you can not\ngo about collecting data about phenomena at these\nscales directly but have to look at indirect data.\nYou have to rely on secondary effects which you\ncan not identify until you have the theory.\nHow far are we from such a theory ?\nMy personal suspicion is that we are a very long\nway, but not everybody will agree with that: people working on superstring s often get very excited\nand there are other approaches as well.\nPHOTO: NICK JACKSON It seems people working in such fields are very\ncurious beasts. Is there a typical profile for a theoretical physicist?\nI often wonder to myself is there a typical theoretical physicist. Certainly to be a successful theoretical physicist you have got not just to be good at\nmaths but to really enjoy it. Professor Abdus\nSalam once said to me, slightly disapprovingly,\n\"theoretical physicists should never marry\" and\nsince he had two wives and I was just married at\nthe time too, it was rather funny (but not perhaps\nthe most tactful) comment! What he actually\nmeant was that to be really successful you have to\nput your work first, perhaps more so than in any\nother branch of science. My daughters [both doing\nmaths degrees] will tell you that you probably need\nto be a bit of a nerd to be a theoretical physicist.\nThere is a public image of the theoreticians as\npeople who belong to an exclusive monk-like\ncommunity. One hears about 'enlightenment'\nand even Tao in physics. Are these really there?\nI think there often is a side of Theoretical\nPhysics that is genuinely mystical but I have to be\ncareful in using the word 'mystical' as it often carries a pejorative meaning nowadays. There is\nundoubtedly a feeling that you are dealing with\nabsolutely fundamental issues, and in doing so you\nfind that normal common-sense ideas really do not\napply. This tends to attract a certain type of person\nand I was that type, quite ecstatic about these\nthings: for example, the idea that what we view as\nreality is only 'veiled reality'.\nDo you ever feel -as it has been claimed by some\nin your field- that you're 'seeing God in the\nequations?\nYou have to be careful because it would be terribly arrogant to say anything like that. The aspects\nof the world that the theorist can study are those\nthat yield themselves to mathematical interpretation and what is perhaps surprising is the depth one\ncan go with that and the strange nature of the world\nthat is thus revealed.\nNo, I find it slightly distasteful to say one is seeing God in the equations, as one is bringing\ntogether two categories that do not really fit.\nThere is undoubtedly a sense of mysteriousness and if you do have religious views you\ntend to relate all profound things ultimately to\na theological perspective but that is true\nwhether it is theoretical physics or music or art\nor human relationships. They are all equally\nimportant and each one of them could be seen\nin religious terms.\nYou are religious but you seem to have no\nproblem in combining science and religion,\nwhat's the trick?\nIt is a non-trivial task. You see perhaps I am\nnot the stereotype scientist. I think Physics is\none aspect of reality but not the only one and\nis certainly not the only authentic way of\nexploring the world. Some people bifurcate\ntheir personality being in a sort of schizoid\nstate in the sense that they do their science during the day and have their religious views in\nthe evening and they just do not relate the two.\nI have never been able to do that. One of the\nadvantages of working in my sort of area, is\nthat precisely because you discover that common sense does not work, you become potentially\nmore broad minded about what might be right. On\nthe other hand, people who work in well defined\nclear-cut classical branches of physics have perhaps more tendency to come to reduction is m where you feel that everything can be reduced to\nthe laws of physics and the dynamics of matter. In\nmy field the very nature of matter is a profound\nmystery and the thought of reducing things to that\nis a bit of a misnomer.\nIn that case what is the definition of a 'religious\nperson' that you use for yourself?\nA religious person is a person who believes that\nthe concept of God is a meaningful one. In the\nChristian religion particularly there is this idea that\nGod is in some way 'personal' and that God can be\naddressed in a meaningful way. However praying\nfor your son or daughter to pass their exams for\nexample, is not necessarily a very sensible thing to\ndo, nice if it happens of course!. Some people like\nPaul Davies talk of the laws of Physics being themselves God. This is a notion of a very abstract God,\nwhat Aristotle wrote about: the 'Prime Mover'.\nThat is not what I mean by God, I do actually mean\nit in a religious sense not just a philosophical con-ce pt.I think it all boils down to the sacramental\nnature of human life which certainly affects the\nway you see the world and people. I believe various religions may be capturing the different facets\nof what may be profoundly true. It has always been\nvery important to me to avoid being dogmatic\nabout anything whether it is the correct interpretation of Quantum Physics or the 'correct' religion.\n\n"
