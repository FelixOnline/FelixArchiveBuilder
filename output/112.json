Her\nearly life was spent in the comparative\nobscurity of a girls* school. When we\nasked her why she de oid ed to read\nAeronautics she replied that,she was\ninterested in aeroplanes. We refused\nto believe this. When she arrived at I.C \u2022he is raed i at ely impressed everyone with\nher personality and has been doing this\never since. She is a great believer in further education for women ( see photo\nabove ).\nShe likes classical piano music,\ntheatre and cinema (as an art form),\nhookey and squash, and Is partial to\na little sport.\nShe dislikes 10-5 men(and women),\ndrunken engineers singing \"The Engineer\"\nand shouting \"Spaghetti\" in the quad.,\nand communal eating;.\nShe is secretary of Phoenix and\nsecretary of mixed Hookey: one wonders\nwhy she did not go to the London\nCollege of Sees.\nHer father makes and her brother\n\u2022 ells ladles'underwear.

Union, held in HM Concert\nHall on Oct. 22nd, was lively and well-attended, with some good \u2022peaking both\nfrom Chad' in the chair and from the\nfloor. The elections were quickly disposed of, and Xovember 5th then dis-cussed. In spite of an uplifting speech\nfrom the floor, reminding Members of\n\"the proud heritage of our predecessors, who laid down their thirty bobs\nat Bow Street Magistrates Court? the\nattitude towards the Harlington fest-iv i ties was favourable. Prom the floor\nmembers were advised, if apprehended,\nnot to state that they were students,\nsince they would then incur a further\npenalty from the University.\nA motion,.proposed by John Dell, that Chad' be presented with a bowler\nhat to be worn while riding his 'new'\nb ley ole waa passed unanimously; such\na hat has now been donated.\nFIREWORKS AS SCIENTISTS MEET\nThe R.C.S. Union meeting on October\nSlat proved one of the liveliest for a long time. A state of war has been declared between the Botany and Geology\nde pts., and fireworks were very much in evidence, Aoonsiderable amount of water\nwas also let loose, and Miss Heywood\nraised an umbrella with which she had\nthoughtfully equipped herself.\nAnother B.C.S. mascot has made its appearance.

    "content": "FELIX DAY COMMEMORATION Commemoration Say this year followed the now established ritual. Over 600 students\nand their friends attended the Ceremony In the Royal albert Hall, at which the Associates,\nDiplomates and Honorary Fellows were presented, and addresses given by the Sector and the\nSpecial Visitor, Sir Alexander Fleck, with some leavening by the Choir of the Musical\nSociety.\nEarlier in the afternoon a service was held in Holy Trinity Church, then at three\no 'clock the pro oe s sion entered the hall, and the Commemoration of the visit of His Late\nMajesty King George VI at the time of the official Centenary of the College had begun.\nAn immediate contretemps was averted by the presence of mind of Professor Hewitt, who,\non observing that his official pro-rector i al front-row seat was not in evidence, proceeded with perfect composure to a spare seat in the block reserved for professors and\nreaders. All seated, the Choir gave tongue to a rousing \"Gandeamug Igitur\", and the\nSecretary of the Onion, Richard Gamett, then read the opening Proclamation, heralding\nthe presentation of Associates and Diplomates. Last year's innovation of soft music\nduring the presentation of the Guilds Associates was this year extended to include the\npresentation of the A.R.C.S.' s and D.I.C.' s. In his final year aa Clerk to the\nGovernors, Colonel Lowry exercised his\nusual wit and anecdotal humour in presenting the Honorary Fellows. They included MT Ssvid Gamett, who obtained aD.I.C. in Botany and has since become\nvery well known in the world of letters;\nSir Harold Bishop, a Gulldaman who joined the B.B.C. in1923, and who occasioned the remark that \"the Alexandra and\nCrystal Palaces have become Bishop's palaces\"; Dr X. Hlndle; Professor Emeritus H. Levy, not today \"jao ket less with his shirt unbuttoned and hair fly ing\" ; Mr p. Bacons, a \"finer who fought\nunder Smuts in the first World War;\nProfessor Emeritus H.H. Read, ex-Dean of\n-the R.C.S.| and Mr C J.R. Sams. Sir William Penney was unable to be present\neither last year or this, and \"the document will be sent to him by post?\nThe Rector presented his report on\nthe progress of the College during last\nyear, and the Choir then sang \"Blest Fair\nof Sirens\" with \"..saintly shout and\nsolemn jubilee..\" Viscount Falmouth now\nintroduced Sir Alexander Fleck, Chairman\nof I.C.I., who, in his speech, brought\nout some of the parallelisms between I.C. and I.C.I., and made some very cogent\nremarks on students and Industry. Viscount Falmouth brought the Ceremony to a close, and the proceedings ended with \"God\nsave the Queen\" and the Recession.\nTHE RECTOR'S REPORT\nThe Reetor opened by welcoming the\nmany guests and friends of the College,\nand in particular the Vice-Chancellor of\nthe university. He believed that this was\nthe first time that the Vice-Chancellor\nhad attended the Commemoration Day celebrations .\nDr Linatead referred to the rapid\ngrowth of the College. \"When we assembled here last year the number of full time students was 2,215. Today it is2,450, an increase of 235. The overall\nincrease in the four years of our expansion is now 800. By this criterion we are sere than half-way to the target\ngiven us by the Government in1953. The\nnumber of new professorships and readerships has gone up by fifteen since we\nlast assembled in this Hall1\n:\nThe Rector also had something to\n\u2022ay on the subject of student residence,\n\"Last year we had accommodation for105 students, today the figure is153. This\nis pitifully small for a College of our\nsize. However, the plans for the new\n\u00a3150,000 Weeks Hall, to be erected In\nthe Worth-West corner of Prince's Gardens, hare now been drawn up and appr ov ed.\n\" . . it is with great pleasure that Ioan announce tills afternoon a piece of\nstop-press news. We hare now been given\nauthority to proceed with the clearance\nof the existing derelict buildings on the\nsite, not merely of Weeks Hall, but of\nthe entire College property on the East\nsad South sides if the square. The negotiations in which we are involved are\nlong, complicated and sometimes wearisome.\nBut here is another hurdle cleared';\nRICHARD GARNETTS TU DENT ORATOR\" I would also like to say a word\nabout an unusual event of the College\nyear. A year ago the Hungarian rising oc our red and a considerable number of\nHungarian university students case to\nthis country needing help; academic\nhelp and food and shelter. The College\nmade a great effort, which involved\nGovernors, students past and present,\nstaff and their wives. We set up at\nshort notice an emergency hostel in wh i oh some twenty Hungarian students\nlived; six Hungarians became full-time\nstudents of the College last year and\nthere are ten this year. In all a sum\nof over \u00a31,500 has been contributed to\nthe relief of Hungarian students, I would like to thank all those who help-ed*:\nSIR ALEXANDER FLECK\nIn his introduction of the Special\nVisitor, Visoount Falmouth said that the\npresence of Sir Alexander Fleck symbolised the close ties between Imperial College and industry. Aa Chairman of I.C.I, and President-elect of the British Association, Sir Alexander needed no introduction to this audience. He had been\ntrained as a scientist, writing a thesis\non the chemistry of the radio-elements,\nand had now become a great administrator,\nchairman of a company worth \u00a3500 million.\nThis wai a very cheering and encouraging\nsign of the times.\nSir Alexander expressed his gratification at being asked to be Special\nVisitor, particularly so in the Jubilee\nyear of the College charter. We eo ul d contemplate with satisfaction based on\nfifty years* experience the successful\nwelding together of the three constituent Colleges, there was every indication ef a youthful spirit ef adventure.\nclosely connected with our \" officially induced middle-age spread*: Our great\ndevelopment scheme was a cause for re-jo icing. He recalled that there was a chronic shortage of technologists even\nin the first century AJ>.,when the\nEmperor Trajan replied to the younger\nPliny's request for technical assistance\nin the Middle East:\"I scarcely have\nenough engineers to deal with works in and about Rome*:\nSir Alexander stated that he was -an unrepentant representative of ind-us try.\" A purposeful business enterprise?\nhe said,\"properly run with all regard to its many responsibilities to the com-m unity.... serves the peoples just as\neffectively....as those who are directly\nconcerned in education? That was one\nparallel between I.C. and I.C.I. There\nwas another,\"Both organisations, I would\nsuggest, were fortunate in this process of\namalgamating distinct but essentially\nallied constituents....in both our cases\nhas been a source of strength and a source of inspiration?\n\"There is no doubt in my mind\" Sir Alexander affirmed,\"that the organisations\nbest....able to advance on the present\nflood tide of technical progress are those\nin which the spirit of studentship strongly survives. The student is one who\nshould be at his most receptive to new\nideas, who maintains long after he has\nput behind him his formal College education a flexible mind and an evergreen capacity for enjoyment in many branches of\nknowledge.\n\"The second quality that a student\nmust possess is an enquiring mind. The\ntrue student seeks knowledge for its own\nsake. Certainly a primary effort must be\nmade to obtain an understanding of baa ic principles, but we must avoid becoming\nfactually muscle-bound. All of us, new\nstudents and old alike, require to exercise good Judgment.\nTHE RECESSION \"These are some of the intellectual\na arks of the good student. However, the\nmost valuable student is the one who combines intellect with character. Character\nis a somewhat vague term but, so far aa\nindustry is concerned, i to an at least be\nmade manifest in terms of leadership and\nwe can all recognise leadership when we\nsee a willingness to accept responsibility and at an appr opiate point in time to\nmake decisions? Important also were\n\"understanding and comradeship\"\n\"But if character manifests Itself\nin leadership, its essence is to be found\nin the individual personality. Our students aast have lively well-stocked minds\nand we should like then to be leaders.\nBut above all let thea be individuals.\nIn an age ef machines and machinery, the\npersonality of the individual is something to be guarded....and to be developed te its full ea pae it y. lt is a high Imperial concept to create a unity out of\ndiversity without damaging what is valuable in that diversity?\n\n"

The Entertainments Committee cannot give Union members preference over outsiders for the few\ntickets that are available at the door\non Saturday evenings if there is no\nmeans of distinguishing them, if all Union members carry their cards they\ncan be given preference, so eliminating\nmany of the complaints that are received each week.\nCH\u00a3SS CLUB\nThe Chess Club started its activities\nthis session with fresher s' trials.

Guildsmen were\nwaiting for any continuation of the hat-tie, but after a few exchanges R.C.S. departed. The Guildsmen were by this time\nstopping and inspecting every car that\npassed. An irate owner 'phoned the Police,\nwho duly arrived in yet another Black\nMaria, with a dog. The heavens opened\nupon them, and two plain-clothes men\ngrabbed a pair of Cuildsmen, who were\nsaying \"miaow, miaow, puss, puss\" to the\ndog. One of them foolishly tried to res is t and received a rough treatment for his pains. In an interview with our re-porter, the Inspector said that the two\nmen had been arrested \"for using insulting behaviour by which a breach of the\npeace may have been occasioned?\nTwo constables, without a warrant,\nentered Guilds to try to prevent the\nshowers, but they were misguided enough'\nto ask a Cuildsman the way to the roof;\nthey were not seen for some considerable\ntime.\nOn hearing of the arrests, the\nRector seemed unperturbed and expressed optimism.\nThe views expressed in FELIX are\nthose of the individual writers, and\nthe Editorial Board will not be held\nresponsible.\nSNOGGING\nSear Sir, Since the opening of the new Union\nbuilding, I have observed a steady in crease in the t tu anti ty of s noggin g that\ntames place on these premises, especial-ly in the lower lounge. It is extremely\ndisconcerting to glance over the top of\nmy FELIX and find a blissful pair of\ncooing doves. It does not make j a a feel\nblissful. On the contrary, it arouses\nmy ire. However, at least half of each\ncouple is generally a Union member, and\nreally we ought to eater for all Union\nactivities. Surely some litt ln room\ncould be set aside for this purpose. The\nFELIX room, for example, would be ideal.\nIt would give you.

What actually happened was\nthat 'Bo' was not allowed to proceed\nunder his own power because he wasn't taxed; That he was in good condition\nwas demonstrated when he was mano eu ve red under power in the car park adjacent to\nthe Roderie Hill Building.\nFarther, the statement that Bo' was\ncausing worry is misleading; he was\noverhauled prior to the Brighton Run on\nNov, 3rd. Tours etc.\nJ.G. Warae\nHon. Sec. C.&G.

In spite of rumours of\nunofficial rag committees sad Trafalgar\nSquare revivalist groups, the Guy Fawkes\nfestivities at Earlington were as popular\nas ever. The almost continuous rain of\nthe previous three days ceased In time,\naad the hep, bonfire and general sport\nwell lived up to expectations.\nThe bonfire could only be described\naa a, blas e of glory, and the heating effect on the eel d night was particularly\nwelcome.(Several people were observed\nhopping around to keep warm.)\nAfter the organised fireworks, aad\nwith the bonfire at last dying scan, the\nparty transferred itself indoors.i few\nfireworks were set off Inside, but\nfortunately with little affect. an s le for d anal ng was provided ay records, ana\nthe I.C, Skiffle Group made sa enthusiasm\ntie aad appreciated debut. One great improvement on last year was the s sae th service of cold-dogs and other refresh-ment s. Throughout the evening 'there prevailed the usual happy atmosphere, and\nall credit to our hard-working Entertainments Committee for its efficient\norganisation.\nAll three Colleges turned out in\nforce to participate in the Mbrphy Bay\ncelebrations. The revellers travelled\ndown to Putney on the usual party tic-ket s, causing the maximum amount of\nchaos.\nThe B.C.S. party arrived first and\namused themselves by throwing flour bag a at passing oars, a minor o olli sion re-sul ting. The occupants were not amused,\nhowever, and summoned the Law. A lorry\ndriver was given the same treatment and\nhis passenger retaliated by throwing a garden fork into the crowd. Luckily no\nserious injury waa sustained \u2014 the weapon is now in the hands of the Polioe,\nThe driver then rapidly reversed into\nthe crowd, smashing a boat wh i oh was being carried from the water. Several men\nwere knocked down, and the boat is reported to be a complete'write-off.\nThe Guildsaen following Bo' now\narrived on the so ene and found the B.C.S. men deployed in a strategic position\nalong the tow-path. A pitched battle en-sued; flour, fireworks and homemade\nbombs were hurled. Chemicals used by\nthe R.C.S, made their presence smelt,\nA Spanner was gallantly rescued from\nthe water by a fully clothed Gulldsmsn,\nbut was found to be only a cardboard\nreplica.\nThe Polioe now began to arrive in\nforce: two launches and a Black Maria\nwere standing by. The combatants were\nshepherded further along the tow-path,\nvanishing in a cloud of flour, earth and\nsmoke. Several people were battling in\nthe water, and many were observed sans\noo u lotte s. The battle was accompanied by\na chorus of hooters and bells from passing tugs. One Guildsman was taken to\nhospital, his spectacles smashed into his\neyes, but he waa later discharged. The\nmob moved in front of the boat house to\nawait the Iferphy and Lowry crews. Another\nBlack Maria arrived, and one demonstrator\nwas taken for a walk by a constable, who\nwas loudly cheered when he released his\ncaptive. In quick succession came two\nPolice oars and two \"mounties\"! and two\nmotor-cycles were used to \"charge\" the\ne row d.A U.C. intruder was narrowly saved\nby the Law from a watery grave, A lively\ndog, led by en attractive female, at-tempted, amid encouraging shouts, to bite\nan Inspector.\nAfter a Boons!aka for the victorious\nGuilds crews, the party dispersed, the\nGuildsmen being escorted to South Ken. by\ntwo defenders of the Peace.

She left\nHyde Park Corner at about 8 o 'clock and\novertook Bo' stationary at Streathaa, with\na salute from the fire bell. Another\n\u2022trio t ly illegal clanging was given to\nParley Fire Station, who responded in like\nBanner, and again, by loudspeaker request,\nto a Poliee oar.\nWith much tintinnabulation, Jesebel\nentered Brighton and was kindly provided\nby the Foliee with an escort to the finishing line, where the ladders all but\nremoved the overhead banner.

This warning initiated a series of chain reactions which\ndispersed ths conspirators, while the cyclist adopted a French accent and,\nprofessing to know little of the English\nlanguage, successfully delayed and exasperated the gendarme, giving the others\ntime to make good their escape.\nAfter this rude interruption ths\nAero Block was attacked with renewed\nvigour.

They finally lost86. Against the\nstrong St. Mary's Hospital 'A' aide, I.C. lost30, although losing Richards, after\n20 minutes, with a broken bone in his hand.\nLast Saturday I.C. were able to finish with 15 men, and they beat Reading 6-0,\nthe points being scored by Gibson (try)\nand Ream (penalty).\nThe lower sides are also\ngood form; their records are:-P WDL Pta. for Pts.ag.\n2nd.

Hookey Victory\nThe hookey team had a well-earned\nvictory over King's College II last\nSaturday, the final score being 4-3.\nAt half-time King's were leading 3-2\nbut in the second half I.C. made an\nall-out effort and completely.out-played the opposing team.\nTable Tennis\nThe table tennis team put up a good fight against Royal Holloway,\nthe match ending in a drew, 5-5.\nSWIMMING\n1.0. Win Two Matches\nThe last two weeks have seen the start\nof a series of matches for the Swimming\nClub. In a recent match against U.C. the\nI.C. team took first place in every event.\nB. Beckett gave I.C. their first win, in the 100 yards freestyle, with A. Cowen in third place. The university Champion,\nR. Loveman, had no difficulty in winning the\nbreast stroke with P. Hills a good second.\nIn the absence of R. Harford, Spokes gained\nan easy win in the bao k stroke, with\nW. Corrigan second, despite his reluctance\nto swim. In the team relay, R. Larson gave\nI.C.a good start, which was maintained by\nthe rest of the team.\nResult: I.C.37 pts. TJ.C.21 pts.\nPolo result: I.C. won 9-1.\nLast Friday I.C. played Q.M.

Hart, lost 4-3.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nCollina Second In U.L. Trials On Cot. 2 3 r d.I.C. suffered a painful\ndefeat at the hands of King's College on\ntheir course of 6-J miles. I.C. produced\nthe first three men home, but King's then\npacked.a solid bunch of six, wh i oh promptly\ndecided the result.\nA small band of I.C. men entered the\nU.L. Trials on Sat. 26th. Oct. at Par lia ment Hill Fields. We congratulate John\nCollins on his fine effort in oo ming second to Shillito e of L.S.E. Our fresher s A. Brash and A. Brown did very well to\nfinish12 th. and 1 4 th. resulting in the\nformer being just in and the latter just\nout of the University second team. For\nthe rest of the band, the beat that can\nbe a aid Is that they packed extremely\nwell, but unfortunately well to the rear\nof the field. On 3 0 th, Oct. the second team defeated\nBorough Road on the I.C. course at Petersham by a very small margin. Only the\nlowly positions of the last two scoring\nmen from Borough Road caused their defeat. Brown ran excellently te record\nbis first match victory for I.C. Finally, on 2nd. Nov., at Hayes in Kent I.C. came third t of lens bury and\nLloyds Bank but defeated Barclays and the\nStock Exchange. However, the highly\noo a plex course o an be largely blamed for our failure. For the second successive\nyear, a number of I.C. men pioneered their\now a routes, wh i oh were rather longer than\nthe official course. Our first man home\nwas J. Conway, who finished 5 th. out of a field of 4 2 . K. Wall ran'sanely, for a change, and starting at the bao k moved\nthrough the field to finish10 th., instead of starting at the front and\nsteadily dropping back, and back,...\nThe past fortnight cannot be called\nsuccessful by any stretch of imagination.\nThe top men in the Club axe running well,\nbut the \u2022middLe\" of the Club is far below last year'a standard. Full your\nsocks up, I. C.C.C.C., or the U.L. Championships will be lost S SOCCER\nI.C. Cut Of U.L. Cup\nThe Soccer 1st. XI has had two setbacks\nrecently. After winning six games in a row, and soaring 31 goals to 8 against,\nwe were defeated by U.C. in a League\nmatch by 5 goals to 4, and by King'a32, after extra time, in the first round\nof the Cup.\nU. O. had a flying start in this important match when they scored two goals\nin the first ten minutes. However, I.C. fought bao k strongly, with goals by\nCodling(2), Wank and Paddle, to lead 4-2.\nFor most of the second half, the play was\nvery even, but the last fifteen minutes\nproved disastrous; U.C. obtained three\nmore goals, the winner oo ming in the last\nseconds of the game. The obvious lesson\nto be learned from this is that the team\nmust play all-out for the full90 mins.\nAgain in the King's match I.C. conceded a goal In the opening minutes.\nAlthough I.C. soon equalise d, King's continued to play the better football\nwhilst 1.0. placed too much reliance on\nlong balls down the middle, many of wh i oh were intercepted. If I.C. had had as much\ncontrol as they had en thous las m, the result\nwould have been mare favourable.\nThe 2nd.,3 rd., and 4th. teams have\nwon all their League matches to date, the\n4th. XI record being 7 wins and a goal\naverage of 3 4 against 9 . The 5th. XI\nresults have not been quite ao good,\nbut this is rather to be expected from\na newly-farmed experimental team.\nHOCKEY\nFirst XI Still Unbeaten\nThe bloc key Club continues to be\nvictorious. Last Wednesday, I.C.1s t.n beat U.C.1 st.51, and cn Saturday\nQ.M. C.1st.40. Against U.C. the half time score was 1-1, but the I.C. team\nasserted its superiority in the second half.\nTha Q.M.

We were victorious\nagainst Southampton, beating them by 3\ngames to 2; this is a new and enjoyable\nfixture.

Everyone who attended the\nmeeting on October 29th. will agree that\nthis is a grave omission. Pew countries\ncan boast of a greater output or variety,\nwhich even surpasses that of Prance.\nMr. Ruffino, who spoke at very short\nnotice, delivered a talk remarkable for\nits brevity and its pre oise scientific nature containing 1.J* by volume\nof solid matter,....\"\nThe varied nature cf Italian wines is such that it is impossible to cover the\nwhole range in the time available. Members\ntasted no fewer than eight varieties, a summary of w hio his given below :-Ohianti. This is the most well-known It a lian wine in this country, and its bright\nand lively appearance makes an immediate\nappeal to the eye and the palate, the\nstraw-covered flask adding greatly to its attractiveness.\nValpolioella Superiore and Bandoline\nThese two pleasant beverage wines are much\nlighter in body and colour than Chianti.\nBarolo. Often described as the King of .\nItalian wines, it is big and full-bodied\nwith a rich ruby colour and a fragrant\nbouquet, having some of the character-is tics of Burgundy.\nAsti Spumante. This wine is a product of\nthe muscatel grape and is one of the most\nfamous sparkling wines in the world,\n\"Opening with a pop that promises delight\".\nMore luscious than champagne, it has great\npopularity with the ladies.\nCinzano Bianco and Vermouth. These are\nmuch heavier wines than their predecessors\nand have a characteristic aroma and flavour.\nI.C. RIDES AGAIN\nLast Sunday I.C. Biding Club continued its explorations of the English\neo unt rrsi de with a four hour ride in ths Chiltsrns. Bo accidents occurred\n(not quite1) \"and all eight riders enjoyed themselves. Some of ths scenery\nwas almost too good to be true, it looked ss though it had come straight\nout of a tourist pamphlet.\nJ. L.S. TOUCHSTONE\n\"The aims and purposes of an University\nEducation\" was the title of this sessions\nfirst Touchstone weekend. The guest s pea ker, Prof. A.R. Ubbelohde of the Chemical\nEngineering Department, introduced the\nsubject in a masterly manner, showing in his talk the advantages of a wide\neducation.\nPROBLEMS WHERE ART MEETS SCIENCE.\nThe burden of vocational training has\nto be carried by an University, hence it is essential that a liberal education be\nplanned so that graduates might gain an\ninsight into the wealth and breadth of\nhuman understanding. It must be decided\nwhether such an education upsets profess,\nional efficiency, and also whether planned\ncourses are a good thing.\nA Multi-faculty administration had its shortcomings; Prof. X. offered \u00a3 2 0 , 0 0 0\nfor some important medical research might\nrequire \u00a3 2 f0,000; Prof Y. might receive\n\u00a3 5 , 0 0 0 for excavating minor Greek ruins,\nfor which \u00a3 5 0 0 would su ff ioe. It seemed\nthat in such oases many problems would\narise, and in fact they did so.\nPCEPLEDOFPLE AND PLANNING,\nThe professor said he had few regrets\nfor his own education, and recalled one\nsmall but typical example of the Oxbridge\nway of life: ao ert a in Professor Poppledopple, who had dug up a seductive marble\ntorso in Tuscany, emerging from his be-statue d rooms only on yer y rare occasions,\nto shuffle lao rossi the' Quad with the torso\nunder his arm!\nOn planning a broad education, he asserted that it can go to extremes: citing as an example the arrangement of libraries. The Classicists try to have Aristotle or Virgil interspersed with Shaw and Shakespeare, so that bro users find things they\ndon't want to read as they search for that\nwhich they do. ^he Scientists on the other\nhand prefer their libraries arranged in a universal way such the tall books on a given subject shall be together.\nTHE EDUCATED MAN.\nThe professor o cnt in u ed by saying that\nan educated man's knowledge was unified,\ni.e. there were no clear cut boundaries\nbetween one subject and the next. He\nquoted Leibnitz as an example! there was\na man, brilliant in his contributions to Mathematics and Philosopy, who also had a not undistinguished career as a diplomat is t At this point the professor pointed out\nthat there was a beer bottle in the chand-e lier, and stressed the importance of\nsocial intercourse. Much good cams of a few people meeting together over a drink\nYHA. CYCLING GROUP\nOn Saturday Oct. 26th. seven members\nmade their various ways to Houghton Hill Youth Hostel near Huntington to inaugurate the cycling section of the group.\nThe hostel warden turned out to be a girl of about 24, extremely attractive,\nbut married. The hostel itself is eq ip ped with a fascinating but defunct\nmill apparatus -there were no oas u ali ties in the mill pond. The return trip was made via Cambridge and Pinching field with several\nstops for \"brew-ups\". A nucleus of\ncyclists has now been formed and it is hoped to see them again on the Alfriston\nweekend (walkers and cyclists) on the\n16/17th. November.\nto have a general discussion. He felt, h \u00bb\nsaid, on many occasions like Polonius in Hamlet...(did you know, as tha professor\npointed out,that Hamlet was Shakespeare's only undergraduate?)\nDISCUSSION.\nAfter dinner, three groups formed to\ndiscuss some questions posed by the pro-fess or. These included whether it was leg.\nit i mate to give time and opportunity for\nother studies during an undergraduate\ncourse? How far can the techniques of\nUniversity education be planned from above';\nDo students make adequate use of the diverse educated pleasures in London? Should\nall Undergraduates aim to live away from\nhome: and how o an one keep fit with all the claims on one's time during term?\nDOWN WITH CHEMISTRY.\nIt was felt that the lecture courses\ncontained too much chaff, especially work\nthat had already been covered at school,\nand that as there were minimum entrance\nrequirements, these o ours es should be\ndra a tio ally revised. Among the more\nencouraging facts was that third year\nGuildsman spend at least one morning a week at L.S.E. Pleasure was considered a personal\nproblem, and everyone should be able to use his leisure hours as he chose provided\nhis work was well done. There was unanimous hate for the methods of the Chemistry\nDepartment in extorting work from long-suffering students, especially the lecturer\nwho expo o ted his research students to work\na70 hour week; and the tutors who recommended that undergraduates should take\nlittle or no part in extra-mural activities reminding them that the laboratories are\nopen for work from 9 a.m \u00ab to 5.30 p.m. SOME BROADENING SUGGESTIONS.\nSuggestions for further non-scientific\nstudies were Civios, Languages and English\nLiterature. The presence of smaller Colleges prompted the suggestion that their\nHall 3 of residence should be integrated\nso that each Hall contained students\nworking in different fao ul ties. The secret-arial colleges could be included easily\nin this plan, as this would give a stimulating effect on a student's life t It waa\nthought that all first and third year\nstudents should live in Halls of Residence,\nwhile second year students should live in lodgings, wh i oh are an education in them-selves.\nOpinions on keeping fit, varied from\nthe squash-fiends and the rut mers round-tho-park, to those who thought that a uv form of physical exertion was bad for the\nmind.\n\"Whereof wo cannot speak, we must needs\nbe silent*.\n\n"
