I find it hard\nto judge someone\u2019s\nwork \u2013 partially\nbecause I never feel like\nI have the authority or\nknowledge to publicly share\nmy personal criticism, and\npartially because I believe in\nmaking art for the sake of art,\nwhich makes it even harder\nfor me to think along the lines\nof a review-format. But I felt I\nshould make an exception for\nLOW; not only has it become\none of my favourite reads,\nbut it has also, unexpectedly,\nentered my ritual of self care.\nLOW is a comic series, set in\na futuristic, underwater, somewhat post-apocalyptic world,\nwhere the Sun\u2019s progression\ninto a red giant has unexpectedly sped up, forcing humans\nto recede into the deep to\ntake cover from their star\u2019s\nradiation.\nWe enter the timeline millennia later, at a point where\nhumanity seems to quite\nliterally be on its final few\nbreaths of air, and the last\nremaining human colonies\nare on the verge of collapse.\nThe story centres around Stel\nand her shattered family,\nwho is attempting a trip to\nthe surface in order to collect\na space probe which might\ncontain the coordinates of a\nhospitable world.\nDuring the course of her\nself-assigned mission, she\ndiscovers lost worlds only\nto shatter them, encounters\nbeautiful creatures only\nto eradicate them, and is\ntrapped in a constant back\nand forth between finding\nand losing her family, her\nobjective, her hope, her life.\nThough the story at first\nglance seems to be little\nmore than an adventure\npacked with action, sex, and\nviolence, what writer Rick\nRemender really deals in is\nhope. In this world he has\nconstructed, hope becomes\nquite literally a commodity.\nIn one of the colonies, Salus,\nhope and optimism have\nbecome a pointless religion,\nabandoned in the face of\nhumanity\u2019s inevitable end\nin favour of an Epicurean\nexistence centered around\npleasure, its residents literally\nliving their final moments in a\ngarden of Eden. What\u2019s the\nvalue of hope when you\u2019ve\n\u201cseen the truth and you\u2019ve\naccepted it\u201d, when \u201cthe\nUniverse has given you the\nmiddle finger?\u201d one of the\nelected leaders asks Stel.\nIn another colony, Voldin,\nhope is seen as dangerous,\nbecoming contraband; its\npropagation punishable by\ndeath. Artists go under-ground, and attempts to\ninspire the hope-starved\npopulace are seen as a major\nthreat to stability and sur-vival, in need of suppression\nby the Ministry of Thought.\nHope is seen as dangerous\nbecause of its ability to lift up\nits bearers, only to bring them\ncrashing down when it\u2019s inevitably proven to be false: \u201cthe\nonly to be torn apart again;\nthey search for their purpose\nonly to realise it involves their\nsacrifice; they find love only\nto experience heartbreak. At\npoints, hope is the only thing\npowering them, pushing them\nforward. And while they successfully manage to overcome\nwhatever ridiculous obstacle\nthey\u2019re faced with, they do so\nonly to plunge deeper into an\nabyss of despair.\nMeanwhile, Greg Tocchini\u2019s artwork perfectly\ncomplements this constant juxtaposition of hope and futility,\noptimism and nihilism. His\nlines are loose, and his colouring work flows effortlessly\nthrough shapes and panels.\nThough his illustrations have\nthe clear purpose of communicating this epic, they might as\nwell not: they often seem like\nnothing more than windows in\nthis beautiful world residing in\nRemender\u2019s mind, stills from\na natural history documen-tary, a glimpse of nature and\nthe universe which simply\nexist defiantly, purposelessly.\nThe series is full of gratuitous sequences of beautiful\nsilence. Expertly designed\npanels calmly illustrate the\nthriving world that humans\nare desperately trying to\nescape from. Vibrant life and\ncolour contrast humanity\u2019s\nbleak and anthropocentric\nperception of their world.\nIt takes twelve issues, and\nhumans setting foot on the\nEarth\u2019s surface for the first\ntime after thousands of years,\nfor someone to finally utter\nthe bitter truth. \u201cHubris.\nProposing that we were the\nlast embers of some unique\nflame\u2026. We are not unique.\nOur absence wasn\u2019t felt. Life\ncontinued on. As if we\u2019d never\nbeen.\u201d\nLOW is truly a work of art.\nI recommend its consumption\nin volumes as its reading\nen-mass becomes a long pro-cess, one that requires setting\ntime aside for it and for you.\nTake your time reading it, and\nallow your eyes to drift as you\nlose yourself in the wonderful\nillustrations, as you discover\npurposeless detail, as you\nconsider the composition\nof the panels, trying to find\nmeaning that may or may\nnot be there. Take time to\nlove the characters who are\nso beautifully constructed,\nto know their hopes, and\nsee their flaws crush them.\nAllow your breath to catch up\nwith your heart as catharsis\nwashes over you and you sit\nthere numb, after your expectations have failed to be met.\nGive yourself space for when\nyou\u2019re brought low.\n\\\\ Take your time\nreading it, and allow\nyour eyes to drift\nas you lose yourself\nin the wonderful\nillustrations, trying\nto find meaning that\nmay or may not be\nthere \\\\\ninevitable fall killing every\none of them\u201d to paraphrase\nVoldin\u2019s leader .\nThe story goes forward\nthrough the constant breaking\nand mending of the charac-ters: we see them reunited\n\\\\ Image Comics\nGet brought LOW | Reading as relaxation\nU\ngly Lies the\nBone follows the\nstory of Jess, a\nyoung woman\nreturning home\nfollowing 3\ntours in Afghanistan, which\nhave left her with severe\nburns after an IED. Struggling\nto fit back into her old life in\nher declining Florida home\ntown, and struggling to cope\nwith her disability and chronic\npain, Jess becomes involved\nin a virtual reality therapy\nprogram. The disembodied\nvoice of a therapist guides\nher through this experience,\nhelping her create new\nworlds to overcome her pain\nand frustration.\nAlthough it sounds like a\nproduct of fantasy, the virtual\nreality therapy at the centre\nof Ugly Lies the Bone is\nactually based in reality: the\nworld Jess visits is based on\nSnowWorld, a virtual reality\nexperience created in the late\n90s and used to help victims\nof severe burns with chronic\npain. Although SnowWorld\nitself is no longer in use, it has\nled to the creation of other\nvirtual reality experiences\nand technology \u2013 one of\nthese is Cool!, a snowscape\npopulated by otters and floating fireballs, which has been\nused in experimental trials to\ntreat sufferers of chronic pain\n\u2013 and these real world implications add an interesting\nextra dimension to the play.\nThe production itself is\nvisually striking. The stage\nis a hemisphere with sloping\nsides, giving an interesting\ndepth to the virtual reality\nmoments, and the play transitions smoothly between the\nsurreal world of the virtual\nreality program and the\nunremarkable reality of Jess\u2019\nhometown. This beautifully\nmirrors Jess\u2019 shifting emotional states \u2013 her hesitant\nwonder at the world created\nby the virtual reality and the\nawkward pain of being a\npoor fit for her old life.\nKate Fleetwood is a compelling Jess, fluidly shifting\nbetween drawing laughs\nwith her delivery of dry and\nsarcastic humour, and heart\nrending raw emotion in her\nportrayal of physical and\nemotional struggles. She is\nparticularly brilliant at capturing the physical difficulties\nJess faces due to her multiple\nskin grafts: her movements\ncapture the physical pain as\nwell as the psychological toll\nthe changes to her body are\nexerting. In one particularly\nunforgettable scene, Jess\nattempts to change from her\ncomfortable \u2018boys clothes\u2019 to\na pretty dress \u2013 Fleetwood\nbeautifully captures Jess\u2019s\nphysical struggle against\nher own body, as well her\nemotional turmoil at wanting\nthe dress.\nThe rest of the cast certainly\ndoesn\u2019t let her down. Ralf\nLittle is endearing as Stevie,\nJess\u2019 awkward former\nboyfriend. Their interactions\nare emotionally charged, at\nfirst with the awkwardness\nof change, but evolving\ngradually into a complex\nportrait of love and loss\nand regret. Olivia Darnley\nplays Jess\u2019 sister Kacie who\nstruggles to support Jess\u2019\nrecovery. Though it sometimes\nfeels forced and clich\u00e9, her\ncheerfulness and relentless\noptimism are a great contrast\nto Jess\u2019 pain and frustration.\nThe play is not without its\nflaws: though the characters\nare emotional and compel-ling, their interactions are\nsometimes predictable and\nlack emotional depth. The\nvirtual reality too has its short-comings; although visually\nstriking, it lacks the emotional\nimpact of Fleetwood\u2019s\nperformance.\nDespite this, it's undeniable\nthat Ugly Lies the Bone leaves\nan impression. The strong cast\nand storytelling as well as the\nvisual beauty of the virtual\nreality combine to create a\ntruly immersive experience.\nUgly Lies the Bone is on at\nthe National Theatre until 6th\nJune.

Or why your\nschool was so\neager to drill into you that\nsome things are bad no-questions-asked-because-I-said-so during those\ninsufferable PSHE lessons?\nWhy some substances are\nkept completely out of our\nreach and have a seven year\nsentence attached, while\nothers have the privileged\nliberty of being sought and\nfound not just at the chemist\u2019s,\nbut even at the off-license?\nLet\u2019s scrutinise rationally,\ncalmly and scientifically on\nthe question of why drugs\nare such a big deal, and why\neveryone appears to believe\nwhat they do, by examining\nthe drug MDMA and its\npotential utility. Let\u2019s do away\nwith the lies for good, and\nuncover the truth, shall we?\nMDMA was synthesised\nby Merck in 1914 and was\nlargely left untouched until\npsychotherapists in the 1970\u2019s\nbegan applying this agent,\nalong with other recreational\nsubstances such as LSD, as a\ncompliment to normal talking\ntherapies for helping treat\npatients with depression,\nanxiety and a host of other\npsychiatric problems. By\nthe early 80\u2019s, the drug was\nused an estimated 500,000\ntimes in therapy. Reports of\ntoxicity or abject therapeutic\nfailure were non-existent,\nthough rigorous studies as\nto its efficacy were in the\nsame quandary. The drug\neventually leaked from the\ntherapist\u2019s couch and permeated into the emerging youth\nculture of raving nightclubs.\nAn abyss of scientific ignorance about the risks and\nbenefits of the drug, coupled\nto widespread recreational\nuse and controversial cases\nof death associated with the\ndrug, subsequently led to its\nban. It was labelled a Class\nA substance, one \u201cof minimal\nto no medical use\u201d, joining\nthe ranks of cocaine, heroine\nand meth. This stands true in\nthe majority of countries in\nthe world, since most drug\npolicies follow the guidance\nof the UN Single Convention\ntherapeutic use. Something\nhas changed however. The\npast decade has seen a\nheroic effort to recommence\nits safety and efficacy testing,\nalong with its utilisation in\nsmall cohorts of psychiatric\npatients with severe treat-ment-resistant and debilitating\nconditions like post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD). It has,\nand I speak free of hyperbole\nhere, demonstrated the\nmagic-bullet-like properties\nof an antibiotic, and the\nclinical safety of a teacake.\nStudy after study is building\non the evidential base that\nit appears to be one of the\nmost promising psychothera-peutic tools ever found, with\na myriad of potential uses\nin everything from social\nanxiety to end-of-life care.\nThe caveat here is of course\nthat pure controlled-dos-age MDMA used in a safe\nclinical setting could not be\nmore different to poly-drug\nEcstasy use in a nightclub.\nWith MDMA, not a single\nsignificant adverse effect has\noccurred in any of the 1133\npatients so far tested, and\nmany large epidemiological\nstudies are demonstrating that\nits risks are marginal taken\nas an isolated compound.\nOne large epidemiological\nstudy concluded that having\ntwo pure MDMA tablets\nis the equivalent of having\n1.5 cigarettes in standard\nmeasures of adversity for\nyour health. Moreover, much\nof the older research on the\nthe famous Professor Nutt\nat Imperial who spearheads\nresearch in this field \u201call drugs\ncan be harmful under specific\ncircumstances\u201d and MDMA\nis truly no exception \u2013 but in\nlight of new rigorous evidence\nit appears that its therapeutic\nwindow appears to be far\naway from its toxic window,\nenshrining its status as one of\nthe safest psychiatric drugs\never to be tested.\nMDMA\u2019s recreational use,\nin the form of Ecstasy, is an\narea of much speculation\nand concern, however.\nEcstasy contains very variable\namounts of MDMA (often\nnone at all) and is usually\nmixed with other substances\nsuch as methamphetamines.\nEcstasy when used on the\nstreets has been linked to\ndeaths from dehydration,\nover-hydration, seizures and\nlife-threatening high blood\npressure. Roughly 20 people\ndie from it annually. There is\nsome consensus that very pro-longed, heavy and frequent\nuse can have some unpleasant effects \u2013 although such\na modicum of application is\nseldom seen, as its addictive capacity is very low.\nThe risks observed are also\nconfounded by the fact that\nEcstasy use is also frequently\nassociated with the use of\nother drugs, such as cocaine,\nwhich is known to cause serious health problems. Taken in\nisolation and in moderation,\nhowever, some indicators of\nthe relative safety of Ecstasy\ninclude its listing as the 17th\nleast damaging drug of those\ncommonly taken in the UK\n(compared to alcohol which\ncame top, and tobacco which\ncame 6th). Its risk to others,\nand to society generally,\nwas virtually non-existent,\ngiven the nature of the drug.\nOne study showed the risk\nof death per Ecstasy tablet,\neven in its impure form, is one\nin two to four million, indeed\nusually as a result of either\nthe tablet\u2019s impurity, irresponsible and excessive drug use,\nor ingestion in a dangerous\nenvironment often alongside other drugs. It appears\nthe risks of even impure\nMDMA use, in the form of\nDavid Charchoglyan discusses the discrepancy behind drug science and drug policy, by using the\nscience and culture of MDMA as a case study\n\\\\ More than 60\nmillion tablets of Ecstasy are consumed\nannually in the UK\nalone \\\\\n\\\\ It has, and I\nspeak free of hyperbole here,\ndemonstrated the\nmagic-bullet-like\nproperties of an\nantibiotic, and the\nclinical safety of a\nteacake \\\\\non Drugs.\nWhat has happened since\nthe fateful events of the 80s?\nIt is still widely used \u2013 more\nthan 60 million tablets of\nEcstasy are consumed annually in the UK alone. It is still\na Class A drug, carrying a\nhefty seven year imprisonment for possession, and free\nfrom governmental acknowledgement of any potential\nsafety of MDMA that was\nused to inform our drug\npolicies is now under heavy\ncriticism for having poor\nscientific rigour, significant\nbias, and tenuous, or even\npurposefully inflammatory,\nconclusions. In the words of\nEcstasy, are very small. Nutt\neven wrote a controversial\npaper comparing the risk of\nhorse-riding (with 100 deaths\nannually) to ecstasy use\ndemonstrating the absurdity\nof our unscientific and often\nhypocritical approach to\nwhat at bottom appears to be\na question of private leisure.\nIt seems we are accumulating more evidence in favour\nof its use, and against its\nClass A classification \u2013 but\nan important and necessary\nacknowledgement to make\nis surely that its use has to be\nin the correct context and for\nthe correct population, or else\nthe risks do truly tally up, and\nthe benefits diminish.\nMuch obscurantism and\npoor science encapsulates\nthe discussion of MDMA, and\nindeed many false inferences\nare made upon it by drawing\non the behavioural and soci-ocultural practices inherent to\nEcstasy use, which as we have\nseen is quite different. A false\ndeduction is recurrently made\nthat the evidence of its (mar-ginal) risk when used on the\nstreets acts as evidence for\nthe ineligibility of the provision of MDMA as a pure drug\nin a controlled environment\nunder the supervision of a\nlicensed medical practitioner.\nIt is the equivalent of banning\npainkiller use by doctors\nbecause there are addicts\nthat abuse heroine. Worse\nyet, it is banning their scientific research. The debate and\ninquiry is shut down before it\ncan even begin. Thankfully,\nsuch an infarct to reason is\nin gentle recovery, as the\nenormous chasm between\nthe practices of therapeutic\nMDMA use and recreational\necstasy use are under continued exegesis.\nMDMA works by significantly increasing serotonin\nlevels in your brain \u2013 the\nchemical responsible for positive feelings and intonations.\nIt immerses people in feeling\nof \u2018love, connection and trust\u2019\nand is generally a highly\npositive experience, though\nsome feelings of anxiety and\nrestless are documented.\nMost notably, it fosters a shift\ntowards openness, emotional\ncandidness, and introspec-tion. This allows people to\ntalk honestly, and indeed\npositively, about themselves,\ntheir lives, their relationships,\nand the world at large,\nfree of the tinted glasses of\nneuroses and self-conscious-ness that usually encumber\nus. It is not a magic bullet for\nsolving the problems of the\nmind in itself, but is instead\nseen as a \u2018catalyst\u2019 that\ngreatly amplifies the power of\nestablished talking therapies.\nMDMA\u2019s effects are distinct\nof the biggest difficulties in\ntherapy, whilst also being one\nof the biggest predictors of\ntherapeutic success. When\nthis open channel of communication is grounded, a well\ntrained therapist can work\nwith a patient to facilitate an\nintrospective and reconcil-iatory analysis of personal\nissues, nurturing an alternate\nperception of certain unpleasant experiences or thoughts.\nUnlike the drug\u2019s eight hour\neffect, the revelations are not\nfleeting. It may sound like\nwishful thinking to some, but\nnumerous studies are now\ndemonstrating this to be perfectly true. For example, five\nyears after follow up of PTSD\ntreatment with MDMA in a\nrigorous study performed in\n2011, it was shown that 85%\nof patients were successfully\nand permanently treated\nafter just three doses, leaving\nmany free of the disease,\nalong with the burden of\nmedication and therapy. Compare this to the current \u2018gold\nstandard\u2019 therapies for PTSD,\nwith poor uptake and terrible\nefficacy, and they begin to\nlook like constructions of\npseudo-scientific ignorance\nmental health disorders.\u201d\nThere is much discussion of\nMDMA\u2019s potential benefit for a myriad of serious\nmental health conditions, as\nwell as for the treatment of\nless severe but nonetheless\nunpleasant problems such as\ngeneralised anxiety disorder.\nNo doubt the confines of\nits applicability will only be\nexpanded further as science\nprogress.\nPsychedelics perfectly\nelucidate an interminable\nencounter between science\nand policy, and a gap\nbetween the evidence and the\naction. But how does such a\npredicament arise? A core\ncomponent has to be a conflict of values. The scientific\nrelentlessness for truth, inextricably entangled with disdain\nfor non-evidence-based,\nnon-deductive, logic-skewing,\nbiased decisions (in other\nwords, bullshit) appears to be\nin direct conflict with much of\npolitics, for obvious reasons.\nAmplify the depravities\nwe\u2019re in once the vermin\nof irrational thought are\ndemonstrably and unfailingly\napplied for decades to shape\nour world, when society not\nonly endorses such mistakes\nbut feels positively smug\nabout them, and when much\nof the scientific community\nitself is infiltrated by the\nnonsense of a brain-washed\nmob. Finally, compound this\nby making millions of lives\ndepend on our answers to\nthese questions, and there\nyou have it \u2013 a zero-sum\nbattle between reason and\nirrationality, from which only\none victor can emerge, and\nindeed must emerge. Many\nof our current problems exist\nand persist under this ignoble\nclimate \u2013 but perhaps one\nof the most salient examples remains the question of\nrecreational substances and\ntheir role in society.\nWe still exist in the midst\nof an age-old gridlock, but\nseveral years of relentless\nstudy, jaw-dropping results,\nand public engagement,\nhave infiltrated the frontiers\nof prejudice and misinformation about MDMA, and\ncommenced dispersing the\nunfounded. Though the\nprocess has been slow, we\nare now living through a psychedelic renaissance. In the\nwords of Sessa \u201csubstances\nsuch as MDMA \u2212 as well\nas other psychedelic drugs\nincluding psilocybin, ketamine\nand LSD \u2212 could hold significant potential as adjuncts to\ntraditional treatment models.\u201d\nWhen 16 million people\nin the UK alone will suffer\nfrom a debilitating mental\nhealth problem, things are in\ndesperate need of change, as\nmillions of minds, and indeed\nmillions of lives, depend on it.\nThe research is beginning\nto reflect this reality, with\nmany more studies under\nway. This situation, alongside numerous others, also\nhighlights the imperative of\ndisseminating an understanding of the scientific method\nto all, empowering normal\npeople with the ability to\ndiscern good evidence from\nbad evidence, the capacity\nto equate benefits and risks,\nand the power to observe\nthe workings of politicians\nand scientists alike with a\ncritical eye \u2013 in essence, a\nself-owned filter for truth. The\nscheduling of MDMA, along\nwith many other potentially\ntherapeutic drugs, as Class A\nsubstances, has discouraged\nand obfuscated systematic\nclinical research in this area,\nand hindered the application of treatments that are\nshowing significant, indeed,\nmind-blowing, potential to\nimprove many lives at small\ncosts. This is a question not\njust of science and truth, but\none of morality. It appears\nthat, slowly, logic and\ncompassion are subjugating\ntaboo, ignorance and vested\ninterests, and in so graceful\na way as only demonstrable\nby the beauty of science. The\nonly question is \u2013 when will\nthe policy catch on?\nfrom other substances, in that\nit does not distort cognition or\nperceptiveness, leaving the\nuser perfectly aware of reality and clear in thought and\nconsciousness. In the absence\nof defensive conditioning,\nanxiety and fear, a seamless\nplatform for trust and open\ncommunication is established\n\u2013 this, indeed, is usually one\nfrom the Iron Age.\nBut it does not begin or end\nwith PTSD, or even MDMA.\nPsychiatrist Dr Ben Sessa, a\nhuge advocate of adjunctive\npsychedelic use in therapy,\nhas said that \u201cdespite 100\nyears of modern psychiatry\nthe spectre of trauma continues to underpin the clinical\npresentation for most chronic\n\\\\ Despite 100 years\nof modern psychiatry the specter of\ntrauma continues to\nunderpin the clinical presentation for\nmost chronic mental\nhealth disorders \\\\\n\\\\ Nutt even wrote\na controversial paper comparing the\nrisk of horse-riding\n(with 100 deaths\nannually) to ecstasy\nuse demonstrating\nthe absurdity of\nour unscientific and\noften hypocritical\napproach to what\nat bottom appears\nto be a question of\nprivate leisure \\\\\n\n"

The\nfirst work, House of Dreams,\nwas a non-narrative work\nconsisting of three pas de\ndeux and a finale to a diverse\nselection of compositions by\nDebussy. The compositions\nwere not entirely disparate:\nall were solo compositions for\npiano, producing a minimalist\natmosphere which was\nmatched by the sparsity of\nprops on stage and the simple\nlighting used throughout.\nEach piece conveyed a\ndistinct emotional tone \u2013 the\nwork opened with the melodic\nand whimsical Prelude from\nthe Suite Bergamasque but\nproceeded to the haunting\nand introspective Des\nPas Sur La Neige before\nfinishing with the frantic and\nbold Passepied. However\nabrupt, these transitions\nwere not jarring as they\nwere confidently handled\nby the dancing pairs: in\nparticular the partnership\nof Sayaka Ichikawa and\nDamien Johnson stood out as\nterrifically coordinated and\nemotive.\nThe second work of the first\nhalf was called Captured\nand was based on the seven\nmovements in Shostakovich\u2019s\nString Quartet No.11 in F\nminor. Originally performed\nin 2012, the work sees two\npairs of dancers move back\nand forward across the stage\nin a territorial fight. Despite\nthe orchestral accompaniment the style and lighting\nremained deliberately min-imal. I particularly admired\nthe costumes of the male\ndancers, who were dressed\nlike farm labourers with a\ntucked in shirt and rolled up\ntrouser legs. This prompted\nmy imagination to question\nwhat type of story choreographer Martin Lawrance\nwas hoping to tell, whilst the\nminimal setting left things\nambiguous enough to let my\nown narrative take hold.\nThe final work, Red Riding\nHood was a funny, bold, and\nat times salacious portrayal\nof the classic fairy tale.\nChoreographed by Annabelle\nLopez Ochoa as a coming of\nage story, it sees a young girl\nbreak from her parent\u2019s rules\nto discover her own sexuality\nand personality. For this,\nOchoa explored the symbolism within the classic fairy-tale\nand crafted her own narrative\nfrom it, knitting together a\nwell-balanced selection of\nnostalgic pieces by French\ncomposers such as Rene Aubry\u2019s Monday and Armand\nAmar\u2019s Le Petit Loup. The final\nresult is thoroughly entertaining and both leads, Cira\nRobinson and Mthuthuzeli\nNovember, were well suited\nto their light hearted roles.\nThe lack of live musical\nperformance was the only\nmajor flaw in this otherwise\nexpansive production. One of\nthe advantages of having a\nlive orchestra is that it allows\n\u2018feedback\u2019 between the\norchestra and the dancers.\nThe conductor\u2019s eye level\nwill normally correspond\nwith the stage floor so the\nmusicians are able to respond\ndynamically to the performers movements, for example\nby extending a crescendo\ndepending on the number of\npirouettes a dancer manages.\nWithout an orchestra individual performances become far\nmore static and the choreography at times felt robotic and\nartificial. There were a few\ninstances of this throughout\nthe night, but for the most part\nthe narratives were immersive\nenough that the pre-recorded\nmusic wasn\u2019t an issue.\nBallet Black was founded in\n2001 by Cassa Pancho, an\nalumnus of classical ballet at\nthe Royal Academy. Shocked\nby the lack of non-white\nstudents and performers of\nballet Pancho established the\ncompany with the aim of providing dancers of black and\nAsian descent opportunities in\nclassical ballet. Sixteen years\nlater this aim is still clear: \u201cIt\u2019s\nall about the D word: Diversity\u201d Pancho writes in the\nprogramme\u2019s welcome letter.\nThe idea being that diversity\non stage will produce diversity at local ballet schools,\nwhich are the foundation\nof the \u201cclassical ballet food\nchain\u201d. This will have numerous consequences, on stage\nBallet Black | A\nrough-cut gem\nEzra Kitson\nBallet Black's Triple Bill was on at\nthe Barbican from 2nd\n\u20134th\nMarch\nBallet Black will return to London on\n1st\nApril as part of the Barbican on\nBroadway programme, which runs from\n31st\nMarch \u2013 1st\nApril\nBallet Black, Triple Bill, Cira Robinson, Jos\u00e9 Alves\nand Mthuthuzeli November in Captured, choreographed by Martin Lawrance \\\\ Bill Coope\nand off: for one thing filling\nballet recitals with non-white\naudiences. This was the case\nin the Barbican which, for a\nballet performance, would\nhave been unprecedented\ntwenty years ago.\nPancho\u2019s goal is gradually\nbeing realised: in August\n2015 Misty Copeland\nbecame the principal ballet\ndancer at the American Ballet\nTheatre. Copeland \u2013 who\nas a young girl in working\nclass Los Angeles was able\nto strike a partnership with\nthe renowned instructor\nCindy Bradley \u2013 is the first\nblack woman to achieve this\ndistinction in the theatre\u2019s 75\nyear old history. Similar successes are occurring across\nthe Atlantic: one dancer of\nimmense renown is Yuhui\nChoe, a Japanese dancer\nwith Korean parentage who\nis a soloist in the Royal Ballet\nin London; this position is also\nheld by Eric Underwood,\na talented black American\ndancer who discovered ballet\nat the relatively late age of\n14.\nThere is still a lot of work to\nbe done, as the historic associations of ballet in Russia,\nItaly, and France mean it\nremains a disproportionately white enterprise. This is\nexemplified by the difficulty\nfaced by non-white performers in getting ballet shoes\nthat match their skin tone:\nballet shoes are traditionally\nmanufactured in pink or\nbeige tones, and until recently\nthere were no ballet shoes\nfor non-white feet. Instead\nblack dancers had to cake\ntheir shoes in makeup before\na performance. Following a\nrequest made on Instagram\nby Underwood, the manufacturer Bloch has now created\na line of darker colours. Not\nall were so understanding of\nUnderwood\u2019s predicament:\none Russian ballet company\neven responded \u201cYou are\nblack, you should wear black\nballet shoes\u201d.\nWhatever it lacks in technical finesse Ballet Black\ncompensates for in bravado\nand panache, it is a thoroughly enjoyable spectacle\nthat is bringing ballet to a\ndiverse audience and is enjoyable regardless of your past\nexposure to ballet.\n\n"

Is it the elixir we\u2019ve\nall been looking for, or just a another\nfad? More importantly, will it be\ndrinkable at the end of it all? Place\nyour bets, and read on.\nI\ntry to be healthy.\nSometimes. You see,\nwhen you have to sustain\na food blog full of cakes\nand ice creams and\nburgers and doughnuts,\nyou have to find a way to\nbalance it out. And luckily for\nme, the healthy food world\nis not limited to chomping\nmy way through an iceberg\nlettuce for dinner while\nbalancing on a yoga mat\n(which recently transformed\ninto a neglected, pink rolled-up piece of plastic gathering\ndust in the corner). So far, I\u2019ve\ntried most of the #eatclean\nsuperfoods suggested by the\nlovely vegans on Instagram,\nincluding chia seed puddings,\nquinoa and kale.\nBut I simply wasn\u2019t liking\nthem, from my mind, my body\nto my soul. My mouth hated\nthe blandness and slimy texture of the chia seeds. Quinoa\nwas getting a tad steep for\nmy wallet, and I couldn\u2019t be\nbothered to look after it on\nthe stove to get that \u201cfluffy\u201d\ntexture without burning the\nbottom. Kale gave me horrible indigestion (Ok, fine, I\nwas trying to demolish 1 kg of\nkale in a day before its expiry\ndate).\nAfter all those clean eating\nfailures, I got hooked up to\nmy next new fad: kombucha.\nKombucha is apparently\nknown as the \u201cimmortal\nhealth elixir\u201d by the Chinese\nand has been around for\nover 2000 years. (Weird. I\u2019m\nChinese and I\u2019ve never heard\nof it in the last 20 years until\n2 months ago on some food\nblog.) It\u2019s basically a fer-mented, sweetened, tea drink\nproduced using a SCOBY.\nAnd SCOBY stands for \u201csymbiotic colony of bacteria and\nyeast\u201d. The SCOBY is mainly\nformed from Saccharomyces, a probiotic fungus, and\nGluconacetobacter xylinus,\nthe bacteria. It claims to have\namazing health benefits, such\nas treating AIDS, cancer, dia-betes, all the way to boosting\nthe libido (Oh yeah). In the\nmouth, it tastes sweet with\nnoticeable acidity and a bit\nof fizz.\nDespite being another one\nof those new health fads,\nthey come in an approachable price tag and actually\ncheaper than your daily Starbucks. Hmm, perhaps it\u2019s a\ngood idea to start swapping\nyour Coke or iced tea to this\nexciting concoction. I also did\na bit of Googling and found\nthat you can actually grow\nyour own kombucha SCOBY\nfrom a shop-bought bottle.\nAnd from that SCOBY comes\na lifetime of kombucha (you\u2019ll\nsee how it works in a sec).\nSo, with my natural\ncheapo identity, thumping\ncuriosity and that love for\nexperimentation, I gave in\nand bought a bottle of raw,\nunfiltered, unpasteurized,\noriginal-flavour kombucha\nfrom Wholefoods. I poured\nmyself a glass \u2013 it tasted like\ndiluted vinegar. I carefully\nclosed the bottle.\nLab coat. Check. Goggles.\nCheck. Hair. Check. Risk\nassessment. Check. Let the\nbrewing begin.\nThe first step of creating\nthis self-sufficient supply of\nkombucha is growing the\nSCOBY. The bacteria and\nyeast in the SCOBY survives\non the minerals, nitrates and\nsugar in the sweet tea. Where\nto find the microorganisms?\nFrom that shop-bought bottle\nof kombucha, of course. But\nmake sure it\u2019s raw and unfla-voured to get all the good\nstuff. We\u2019ll call this \u201cstarter\ntea\u201d from now.\nYour success depends on the\nchoice of tea: choose plain\nblack or green tea, with the\nbest being the trusty English\nBreakfast. Avoid flavoured\nteas such as Earl Grey as the\noils in them will destroy the\ncolony. The sugar you use is\nalso important \u2013 plain white\ncane sugar gives the best\nresults while the impurities in\nbrown sugar or sugar alternatives are also likely to destroy\nthe microorganisms. Make\nsure the jars and pots you\nuse are sterilized with boiling\nwater, not soap or alcohol.\nI added four tablespoons\nof sugar to a cup of boiling\nwater, chucking in three teaspoons of loose leaf Oolong\ntea and let it steep for 20\nminutes. When the tea has\ncooled down, I poured the\ntea and the \u201cstarter tea\u201d into\na sterilized glass jar in the\nratio of 7:1. I covered the jar\nwith a paper towel, secured\nit to the brim with an elastic\nband and left it in a dark\ncorner in the cupboard under\nthe sink.\nKnowing that it takes up to\ntwo weeks for a SCOBY to\nform, the next few days were\na mixture of excitement of\nanxiety. On one night I was\nworrying about it so much\nI couldn\u2019t sleep. What if it\nwent mouldy? What if it got\ncontaminated? What if it turns\ninto some neon green, radioactive liquid seeping through\nthe floor and poisoning my\nneighbours below?\nOn the sixth day, I couldn\u2019t\nwait any more and visited the\njar. Guess what? A SCOBY\nwas floating on the surface\nof the brown, sweet tea! It\ntook the cross-sectional area\nof the jar, had a jelly-like\ntexture and a pinkish colour,\nrather like a jellyfish. I left the\nSCOBY for another 6 days\nuntil it grew to a thickness of\nabout 1 cm. I repeated the\nsame preparation procedure\nas above but with twice the\namount of liquid, and added\nthe new SCOBY mother.\nAnother week went by,\nwhen the brew should be\nready to drink. A new baby\nSCOBY formed across the\nsurface of the liquid. But much\nto my horror, it wasn\u2019t pink\nand plump as the first time\nround. There were spots of\ndark green mould on top, too\ngruesome-looking to be published on paper. I must have\ngot the tea:sugar ratio wrong,\nor didn\u2019t sterilize the glass jar\nenough. I held back my tears,\nemptied the failed brew to its\ngrave, and ended the kombu-cha cycle. RIP SCOBY.\n// I\u2019ve tried most\nof the #eatclean\nsuperfoods\nsuggested by the\nlovely vegans on\nInstagram, including\nchia seed puddings,\nquinoa and kale. But\nI simply don\u2019t like\nthem //\n\n"

It\ndoesn\u2019t quite, but no matter. What marks nostalgia off from other\npainful emotions, is the sense of enjoyment that we derive from it;\nwhile we might mourn for what has come before, we can still enjoy\nour memories of it. Nostalgia is the emotion that is at the heart of\nWong-Kar Wai\u2019s masterpiece In the Mood for Love, which is suffused\nwith the heady aroma of the past. Exploring the platonic relationship\nbetween a man and a woman living in Hong Kong in the\n1960s, everything about the film is designed to conjure up\nmemories and emotions, from the stirring string theme to\nthe beautiful cheongsam that Maggie Cheung\u2019s character wears. Even the film\u2019s original Chinese title, \u201cThe Age\nof Blossoms\u201d has a double meaning, referring to fleeting\nbeauty and love. Watch this film, and allow yourself to revel\nin nostalgic melancholy.\nIn the Mood for Love (2000)\nFrances Ha (2012)\nIf there\u2019s one scene that encompasses the exuberant joie-de-vivre present in Noah Baumbach\u2019s Frances Ha, it\u2019s the titular\ncharacter \u2013 played brilliantly by Greta Gerwig, who also\nco-wrote the screenplay \u2013 running and dancing along a Manhattan street to David Bowie\u2019s \u2018Modern Love\u2019. Any film that features\nGerwig dancing is ripe for self-care \u2013 see the recently-released\n20th\nCentury Women \u2013 but Frances Ha manages to balance a sense\nof wonder with the grim reality of adulthood. Gerwig plays Frances,\na contemporary dancer who is unable to make her passion into a\npaying career, and whose relationship with best friend Sophie\nis strained. When Sophie moves out of the apartment they\nshare, it is the catalyst for a series of house-swaps for Frances,\nand signals the beginning of a new part of their friendship.\nCertain scenes stick in my mind, such as Frances trying to find\na \u2018new Sophie\u2019 and making them play-fight in Central Park, but\nwhat makes Frances Ha so enjoyable and watchable is Baumbach\u2019s ability to temper Gerwig\u2019s innate sweetness and prevent\nit from becoming cloying.\n\\\\ AllStar\nAnnie Hall (1977)\nbreak-up. Allen is known for his off-beat humour, but Annie Hall delivers up\none of his most complex screenplays, with individual gags \u2013 whose subject\nmatter ranges from growing up in Coney Island to the work of Marshall\nMcLuhan \u2013 coming together to form an intricate whole. Annie Hall is a love\nletter to New York City, to comedy, but most of all, to Keaton, whose presence is a luminous beacon throughout.\nWhile Annie Hall might not be the best of Woody\nAllen\u2019s extensive filmography \u2013 I\u2019d argue that that\nhonour should go to Manhattan \u2013 nothing can cheer\nme up quite like watching Diane Keaton absolutely\nsteal every scene she\u2019s in. Keaton plays Annie Hall,\nwhile Allen plays Alvie Singer, and the film explores\nthe formation of their relationship, and their subsequent\nFred Fyles recommends the best films for some indulgent viewing. From New York-based\ncomedies, to Cantonese stories of unrequited love, these four films should leave anyone\nfeeling a bit better after a couple of hours. So go on \u2013 treat yo\u2019self!\nThe best picks for some cinematic self-care\n\\\\ Festival de Cannes\nIt is impossible for me to watch Carol \u2013 Todd Haynes\u2019 story of two\nwomen falling in love in the 1950s \u2013 without a huge smile on my face.\nThe film is ground-breaking in the fact that it allows its two leads \u2013\nCarol Aird (Cate Blanchett) and Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) \u2013 to\nhave a happy ending, but more than that, Haynes and scriptwriter\nPhyllis Nagy have created a love story that really makes you root for\nthe characters involved. Beginning in media res, we know that\nCarol and Therese will find each other, and this knowledge\nimparts significance to every glance, gesture, and touch\nbetween the two. More than a simple love story, Carol tells\nthe tale of two people trying to bridge the gap that society has\nplaced between them, and takes us along for the ride.\nCarol (2015)\nGoing to the cinema in the middle of\nthedayistheperfectformofself-care\n\u2013 indulgent, self-focussed, relaxing \u2013\nas Culture Editor Fred Fyles realised\nwhen he went along to a midday\nsceening of Jacques Rivette\u2019s Celine\nand Julie Go Boating. Here, he\nencourages you to skip lectures,\nhead down to your local cinema,\nand settle in for a midday treat\nI\nn Jacques Rivette\u2019s 1974\nnew wave classic, Celine\nand Julie Go Boating,\nthere exists the perfect\nmetaphor for going to\nthe cinema in the middle\nof the day: the plot revolves\naround two women playing\nmagical games in a Paristurned-playground; towards\nthe second half of the film,\nthey discover a mysterious\nhouse, into which they\nrepeatedly disappear, only\nto return several hours later,\ndazed, with no memory of\nwhat has happened.\nFor me, Celine and Julie\nGo Boating is a case of life\nimitating art: after finishing a\nscreening that had started at\nmidday, I emerged into the\nbright spring sunshine, just as\nconfused as Celine coming\nout of the walled-off mansion.\nThe film had sucked me into\nits peculiar rhythms, which\n\u2013 over its three-hour runtime\n\u2013 had ebbed and flowed, and\nbeing confronted by the real\nworld was like taking a cold\nshower: a sharp shock, but\ncompletely refreshing.\nThis screening kindled in\nme two things: firstly, an\nappreciation of film that has\ncontinued ever since; and sec-ondly, the magic of daytime\ncinema. Going to the cinema\nis, anytime of the day, a form\nof self-care; an act that says\nto the world \u2018I am going to\nspend this time on myself\u2019. But\ngoing during the day has an\nextra buzz to it \u2013 it feels a\nbit naughty, like you\u2019ve been\nskipping school, and coming\nout of the cinema while\neveryone is still working at\ntheir desks feels wonderfully\nindulgent.\nIn my mind, self-care is one\nend of a spectrum of coping\nmechanisms which stretches\nall the way to self-medication.\nWhile self-care might be the\nacceptable face of dealing\nwith stress \u2013 all scented\ncandles, relaxing baths, and\ncalorific food \u2013 self-medi-cation, often with drugs or\nalcohol, seems to represent\nthe \u2018bad\u2019 way of handling our\nproblems. Where does the\ncinema fit onto this scale? To\nme, it seems to fall somewhere in-between: while it\u2019s\nnot quite the same as downing brandy sours, going to the\ncinema is more heady and\npowerful than other forms of\nself-care.\nLike with drinks and drugs,\nto a large extent going to the\ncinema involves active con-sumption. There is, of course,\nthe whole ritual of purchasing\nthe ticket \u2013 and those of us\nwho obsessively frequent\nthe same cinema will often\nchoose the same seat \u2013 but to\nvisit the cinema is to make an\nactive choice; a choice to sit,\nin a darkened room, alongside fellow cinema-lovers, for\nthe sole purpose of watching\na film.\nThe very best films will\nfrom yourself. But while the\ncinema can act as a distrac-tion, it is far from mindless:\nto get the most out of a film,\nyou need to focus on it com-pletely; step away from your\nsurroundings, and immerse\nyourself in the screen.\nGoing to the cinema is\nstill my most regular form\nof self-care. To me, it serves\nas a statement: I am telling\nmyself \u2018it\u2019s ok, you might\nhave exams coming up, or\nrevision you\u2019re meant to do,\nbut for the next few hours\nyou\u2019re going to spend this\ntime on yourself\u2019. But unlike,\nsay, a Netflix binge, going to\nthe cinema never leaves me\nfeeling deflated: annoyed,\nmaybe, that I\u2019ve spent money\non a shit film, but never unful-filled. Whether it\u2019s a cheesy\nblockbuster, or an astringent\nDanish flick, the cinema never\nleaves me feeling empty.\nFor those of you who wish\nto follow me on this path to\ncinematic enlightenment, I\nhave a few words of advice:\nfirst of all, get to know your\ncheapest local cinemas. If you\nwant to go more than once\na week, things can add up\npretty quickly, but knowing\nthat the BFI offers under-26s\n\u00a33 last-minute tickets, or that\nICA members can have \u00a33\ntickets during the day, really\ntakes the pressure of your\nstudent loans.\nSecondly, try and keep an\nopen mind: if you\u2019re feeling\ndown, you might instantly\nreach for the latest feel-good\nrelease, but there is catharsis\nto be found in emotional\ncinema, and sometimes\nhaving a good cry in the dark\ncan do wonders for your\nmental health (don\u2019t go too\nfar though: Shoah isn\u2019t that\ngreat for self-care).\nFinally, and most impor-tantly, embrace going by\nyourself. Many people I know\nwould never go to the cinema\nby themselves, but think about\nit: you\u2019re going to be sitting\nin a dark room, with ideally\nnobody talking \u2013 there is\nnever a more appropriate\nplace to go by yourself. While\nit might be great to go with\nfriends, don\u2019t let their availability limit what you go and\nsee. Remember: you\u2019re going\nto the cinema for yourself, so\npractice saying \u2018ticket for one,\nplease\u2019 in front of the mirror,\nand get on down to a midday\nscreening!\n\\\\ Going to the\ncinema is, anytime\nof the day, a form\nof self-care; an act\nthat says to the\nworld \u2018I am going\nto spend this time\non myself\u2019 \\\\\nThe magic healing power of daytime cinema\nintoxicate you. In a sort of\nreverse-mindfulness, they will\ntransport you away from your\ncinema, with its frayed seats\nand sticky floors; away from\nyour deadlines, looming on\nthe horizon; away from your\nphone, and its constant pinging of emails and texts; and\n\u2013 most importantly \u2013 away\n\\\\ BFI\n\n"

The\ngravitational pull of the moon\nwill, in theory, exert those\nsame forces on the water\ninside your body, meaning\nyou have high tide and low\ntide twice a day.\n\u2018Human tides\u2019 have been\nproposed to affect the brain\nand be drivers of suicide\nand murder, aggressive\nbehaviour in animals and\neven to influence the timing\nof menstruation. However,\nsimply due to us being much,\nmuch smaller than the oceans\nand the moon being really,\nreally far away, the effect of\nlunar gravity on an individual\nhuman is in practice so small\nas to be immeasurable,\nand so it\u2019s unlikely that it\ncould possibly drive any\nsort of change in behaviour\n(although this hasn\u2019t stopped\nsome questionable studies\nclaiming to have found a\nlink!)\nIn fact, the gravitational\nfield of a mosquito on your\narm would exert a greater\ngravitational force on you\nthan the moon simply by\nvirtue of being closer, which\nputs into perspective just how\nlittle impact this particular\nscience fact will have on your\nlife.\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nMoonof\nmylife\nAlexandra Lim discusses on how our choice of food gones beyond the need\nof eating for survival\nLast week I was at a posh\nrestaurant, because pretending to have money with\nmediocre savings is this new\nand dangerous trend I have\nundertaken. Dessert being my\nultimate weakness, I made a\nbig deal out of the pre-dessert\nand dessert. Meringuelets\nshrouded in freeze-dried\nraspberries, swimming\nblissfully in Chantilly. Then,\na brown sugar tart with a\ndelicate scoop of stem ginger\nice cream. The ice cream\nmelted atop the chocolate\nmousse nestled under a skinny\nmembrane of coffee jelly,\nand I started to think about\nthe unspoken connections\nbetween food, body and\nmind.\nTo start, I\u2019d just like to\nsay that there is a need for\nclarification in any field of\nknowledge. But there are surprising twists, and in this case\nof course I\u2019m talking about the\nwild, young, uncertain world\nof nutrition. There are lots\nof irrefutable nutrition facts,\nlike how we as humans need\ncertain nutrients to grow and\ndevelop properly, keep our\nbrains and bodies optimally\nfunctional. There are different\npeople who undertake theories in different ways and with\nvery different behaviours.\nYou have X, who treats this\nwhole nutrition thing very,\nvery seriously. He has a\nVitamix to keep his wild green\nsoul satiated in the morning,\nand a spoonful of blackstrap\nmolasses mixed and heated\nwith turmeric and perhaps\njust a dash of spirulina at\nnight. Turkey is good and\neverything else might kill him.\nHe gets shifty at restaurants.\nAnd all that being said, the\nvariations of X, whatever diet\nculture he may adhere to, are\nendless. There\u2019s Y, who likes\nto run and have an apple\nevery day. He tries, but may\nforego the strict gym session.\nThen there\u2019s people like me\nwith incredible levity, who are\ninterested and read up on all\nthe latest finds, but still don\u2019t\nmind the occasional cake-gorge and wine splurge (yes\nwine is good for you, but do\nyou know how many bottles\nyou need to get a desirable\namount of resveratrol\u2026?).\nI guess X is the good sir\nI would like to elaborate\nmore on now. His soul is\nbright when he churns the\nkale and frozen bananas\nat precisely 8 o\u2019clock every\nmorning, pouring it into a\nclean and wholesome Mason\njar. Mind you, this is all\nfictional, and I\u2019m just keeping\nin line with less ubiquitous\nletters-of-name-beginnings,\nso bear with me. The drink is\ndelicious, and I would agree.\nHe says he is better than the\n18-year-old X who dined on\nsausages and milkshakes\nwithout a qualm, all those\nyears ago. He\u2019s right, and\nyet not quite so. Has it ever\ndawned on you (yes you,\ndear reader), that eating,\ndespite being this magical,\nholistic ritual, this beautiful\nconstant fest of discovery\nand perhaps healthfulness, is\ndownright scary? No matter\nwhat you consider yourself,\nhow healthy, how vegan or\ncarnivorous, that we are still\nsomewhat the same? No\nmatter what, we must consume other lifeforms to sustain\nourselves, and in doing so we\ntransmit energy from one to\nthe other.\nSelf-awareness is also\nawareness of death. As stated\nrecently in a very interesting\nrecent article in the Atlantic,\nonce we cultivated the means\nto indulge ourselves in piles\nof grapes and doughnuts,\nthe Ancients (think Julius,\nCleopatra, Nero), decided\nthat there was so much more\nto life than just having full\nbellies, and went on to build\ncultural legacies, filled with\nmeaning and sustenance that\nexceeded the physical, with\npyramids, recreation, and\nmaterial. Food and eating\nwent from mere sustenance\nto settling exactly in this category of recreation, symbolism\nand complicated meaning.\nWe eat to celebrate, or use\n\\\\ It is a irrefutable\nfact that humans\nneed certain\nnutrients to grow\nand develop\nproperly \\\\\n\\\\ No matter what,\nwe must consume\nother life forms to\nsustain ourselves,\nand in doing so we\ntransmit energy from\none to another \\\\\n\n"

The\nsexual connotation\nit carries will remain for\nas long as clubs continue\nto offer such services, but\nthere is a sporting aspect\nto it as well that, though\nrather well-known as well, is\nalmost certainly not the first\nthing one would associate\nwith pole dancing. That\npole dancing is indeed a\nform of sport is advocated\nby plenty of pole instructors\nand societies out there,\nImperial\u2019s very own Pole and\nAerial Society being one of\nthem, and after covering the\nLondon Pole Varsity 2017\nfor felix\u2019s sport section last\nSaturday, I must say that I\ncompletely agree with the\nnotion. Considering that my\nknowledge and ability to\nappreciate anything with\nthe word \u2018dance\u2019 in it, pole\nor not, is comparable to that\nof a potato, combined with\npole dancing being almost\nnon-existent in my home\ncountry (hence I\u2019d never seen\na pole dance prior to last\nSaturday), it must\u2019ve been\nmighty impressive. Good\nnews IC Pole and Aerial: it\nwas indeed!\nFirst up on the day was\na guest performance by\nIC\u2019s very own Melissa Lee,\nstarting her routine with\nsome dance moves before\nproceeding to pull off some\notherworldly acrobatics on\nthe pole. The beginners\u2019\ncategory, in my opinion\nhardly \u2018beginner\u2019 at all considering the athleticism in\nthe contestants\u2019 moves,\ncommenced afterwards and\nwas followed by a lunch\nbreak. Head judge Lauren\nElise kicked off proceedings\nafter the break with a guest\nperformance that had the\ncrowd delighted and myself\ndumbfounded, at one point\nin her routine pulling off an\nimmensely challenging move\nthat I can describe as nothing\nfitness and strength, let\nalone the intermediates\u2019, but\nthe contestants showed me\nexactly how it\u2019s done. With\nsome truly challenging moves,\nlike doing full splits while\nhanging upside down, and\nspinning while suspended\nupside down and holding\nonto the pole solely by the\nstrength of their thighs no less,\nit was then that I mentally confirmed with myself that pole\n2nd\nin Alina\u2019s case), while UCL\nfinished overall champions.\nYour cue, Memeperial.\nWell, a review by a total\nnovice is hardly the most reliable account of this event, but\nI must say that through all the\ncringing from time to time at\nwhat I imagine must be a terribly painful move I\u2019m seeing,\nI\u2019m thoroughly impressed\nwith what I saw. From the\nbeginners to the advanced,\nanswer:\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t appreciate\nwhat I\u2019m doing on the pole,\nthen that\u2019s your loss because\nyou shouldn\u2019t be focusing on\nwhat I\u2019m wearing, you should\nbe focusing on the moves that\nI\u2019m doing.\u201d\nHer answer indirectly sends\na message that pole dancing\nalso empowers. The clich\u00e9\nabout not being afraid of\nwhat others say certainly hold\ntrue for something shrouded\nwith a negative image like\npole is. I was also able to\nspeak to Lauren and ask for\nher opinion on this, and she\nagreed:\n\u201cThey come in with body\nconfidence issues, and they\ncan do something where they\nfeel powerful, and they can\nmake whatever they want.\nIt\u2019s completely up to what\nyou want to express and it\nreally gives you a really nice\nplatform to do that.\u201d\nWell, if the purpose of Pole\nVarsity was to cast a different\nlight on pole dancing, then it\u2019s\ndefinitely been a success in\nmy case. In more ways than\nsimply because I\u2019ve never\nseen a pole dance before, it\u2019s\nbeen an eye-opener for me.\nIt\u2019s given me the confirmation\nthat pole is, in fact, a sport,\nand that it can empower as\nmuch as it can keep one fit.\nGreat job, Pole and Aerial,\nand keep up the good work!\nshort of incredible.\nThe intermediate category\ntook place after, the athleti-cism in the contestants\u2019 moves\na step up from the beginners\u2019.\nAfter that, the next category\nwas preceded by a guest performance as before, this time\nby Renata \u201cRenee\u201d Sprenger,\nbefore moving on to the highlight of the day: the advanced\ncategory. Already, I could\nscarcely imagine how anyone\ncould top the beginners\u2019\ndancing is, in fact, a sport.\nThis was as much a display\nof fitness, raw power and\nstrength as it was artistic.\nIn any case, group performances by UCL and IC\nfollowed, before the prize-giv-ing session brought the event\nto an end. Imperial\u2019s Alina\nPaduraru, Hayley Leung\nand Brandon Tsang all took\n2nd\nplace in the beginners,\nintermediate and advanced\ncategory respectively (a joint\nthe contestants all gave\nperformances that combined\nstrength, fitness, athleticism\nand finesse so well.\nThat aside, no coverage of\nan event is complete without\ninterviews of any sort. I managed to speak with Melissa\nand have her answer one of\nthe more difficult questions\nabout pole dancing: how do\nyou dispell the sexual connotation pole dancing carries?\nI must say, I rather like her\n\\\\ Valle Varo\n\\\\ The sexual\nconnotation it\ncarries will remain\nfor as long as clubs\ncontinue to offer\nsuch services \\\\\n\\\\ \u201cIf you can\u2019t\nappreciate what\nI\u2019m doing on the\npole, then that\u2019s\nyour loss because\nyou shouldn\u2019t be\nfocusing on what\nI\u2019m wearing, you\nshould be focusing\non the moves that\nI\u2019m doing.\u201d \\\\\nKenDOorKenDONT?Youbethejudge\nGabriel Ng\nL\nast weekend on\nthe 4th\nand 5th\nof\nMarch, the annual\nUK Kendo University\nChampionships took\nplace in Cambridge,\nwhere Imperial College\ntook home several awards,\nincluding winning the kyu\ngrade team competition.\nKendo is a Japanese martial art, similar to\nEuropean fencing, where\nthe objective in competitions\nis to score points by striking\nthe opponent on one of\nseveral predetermined target\nareas with a shinai (bamboo\nsword), which represents a\nreal Japanese katana. Kendo\nis a relatively recent descendant of earlier Japanese sword\nschools, which emerged due\nto a need to practice without\nthe danger of real or wooden\nswords.\nThe University Championships are divided into six\ncategories, with four individual events: the men and\nwomen\u2019s kyu for players with\nless than two years\u2019 experi-ence; the men and women\u2019s\nopen for players with more\nthan two years\u2019 experience\nor with a dan grade; as well\nas two team events: the kyu\nand open team competi-tions, where competitors\nfight in teams of five with\nsimilar experience restrictions as seen in the individual\ncompetitions.\nOur competitors left\nfor Cambridge on Friday\nevening, staying overnight\nready for an early start on\nSaturday morning for the\nindividual competitions. On\nSaturday, the championship\nbegan simultaneously with the\nmen and women\u2019s kyu grade\nindividual events, where a\ntotal of sixteen of our members competed.\nIn the men\u2019s kyu category,\nmost of our members were\nknocked out in the pool\nstages, but one of our mem-bers, Spencer Cheung, made\nit to the semi-finals, winning\njoint third place. In the\nwomen\u2019s kyu, three Imperial\nplayers competed, with one\nmaking it to the quarter finals.\nBoth the men and women\u2019s\nkyu were eventually won by\nplayers from Cardiff Metropolitan University.\nOn Saturday afternoon,\nafter the kyu grade events,\nthe men and women\u2019s open\ncompetitions took place. No\nmembers from Imperial took\npart in the women\u2019s open,\nand both competitors from\nImperial in the men\u2019s open\nwere unfortunately eliminated\nin the pool stages. These were\neventually won by players\nfrom York and Bradford\nrespectively.\nThe championship\nadjourned here for the day,\nand after a short free practice\nsession with competitors from\nother universities and senior\nkendo players, our members\nretired for dinner and early\nrest in preparation for the\nteam competitions on Sunday.\nOn Sunday morning, the\nhighly anticipated kyu team\ncompetition took place,\nfollowed by the open team\ncompetition. Two teams from\nImperial took part in the kyu\ncategory: Imperial B was\nknocked out by University of\nKent A in the first round, but\nImperial A decisively won\ntheir first-round match against\nYork, to face the strong Denshinkan A team in the second\nround.\nAgainst Denshinkan, Imperial A were not off to a great\nstart, with the first two fights\ngoing to Denshinkan by two\npoints each. The third fight,\nfought by Sup Song from\nImperial, needed to be won,\nand Sup delivered with an\nimpressive win of two points.\nImperial\u2019s Liam Yasin was in\nfourth position, and won by\none point, leaving the score\nat two fights each, Denshinkan with more points, leaving\nit to the fifth fight to decide\nthe match.\nOur fifth and final player,\nSpencer Cheung, was up\nagainst one of the strongest\nplayers in the kyu category,\nwho had won the individual\nevent the day before. A\nvictory being necessary to\ncontinue; Spencer delivered\nwith a decisive two-point\nwin against the player from\nDenshinkan. Thus, Imperial A\nemerged victorious against\nDenshinkan A, three fights to\ntwo.\nImperial A, with further wins\nagainst Lancaster and the\njoint Glasgow/Strathclyde\nteam, proceeded to the final\nagainst the team from Oxford\nUniversity. With Oxford\nwinning the first and third\nfights, and Imperial winning\nthe second and fourth, it was\nagain going to be decided\nby the fifth fight. Spencer\nwon the fight crushingly by\ntwo points, giving Imperial\nA first place in the kyu teams\ncategory for the first time in\nmany years.\nUnfortunately, the Imperial\nteam competing in the open\ncategory lost in the first round\nto King\u2019s College London,\nand was knocked out of the\ncompetition. This category\nwas eventually won by\nOxford University after an\nexciting final between Oxford\nand York, culminating in a\nrepresentative match between\nthe first and second place\nwinners of the men\u2019s open the\nprevious day.\nMany congratulations go\nto the members of Imperial A\n(Ze Rong Lum, Jaime Rodriguez, Byung Sup Song, Liam\nYasin and Spencer Cheung)\nfor winning the kyu teams\ncompetition, and Spencer\nCheung for placing third in\nthe men\u2019s kyu individuals.\nMany thanks also go to our\ncoach, Emiko Yoshikawa, who\nhas spent many years coaching Imperial students in the art\nof Kendo, for her dedication\nand support to the club.\nThe 2017-18 University\nChampionships will be hosted\nby Glasgow University.\n\\\\ A need to\npractice without the\ndanger of real or\nwooden swords \\\\\n\n"

It\u2019s\nyour body and you should\ndo with it as you please.\nI do feel, however, that if\nyou weren\u2019t aware of the\nexistence of sex toys, you\nshould probably know\nabout them. There are a\nwide range of dildos and\nvibrators available online,\noften for very reasonable\nprices. By this point, as far\nas I\u2019m aware, the taboo\nis mostly dead. If you\nhaven\u2019t picked one up yet,\nnobody is judging, so why\nnot have a pop?\nLube\nIf you\u2019ve never tried lube\nduring a solo session, you\nreally should. If you\u2019re a\ncircumcised male, you\u2019re\nprobably used to lubricating your wanks. If you\u2019re\na girl or a member of the\nforeskin flock, you might\nnot have considered the\npleasures of a slippery\nhand. Get a towel, sit\ndown and get yourself a\nbottle of lubricant. I personally recommend J-lube,\nan ex-veterinary lubricant\nwhich comes in powder\nform, which you can dilute\nin a protein shaker. If you\ncan\u2019t be bothered with the\nhassle, grab yourself a\nsilicon/water hybrid lube.\nYou\u2019d be surprised what a\ndifference it can make.\nFleshlights\nThere\u2019s a certain stigma\nB.C. Maile\nattached to fleshlights.\nPerhaps people see it as\na symbol of acceptance\nthat you\u2019re not likely to\nget much action, but I\nthink those people can go\nfuck themselves. Nearly\neverybody wanks, and\neveryone who wanks\nshouldn\u2019t feel ashamed\nabout trying to make\nit feel better. You can\npick up a penetrable toy\nfor about \u00a325, and the\ndifference it makes is\npretty worthwhile. It\u2019s not\nquite an everyday thing.\nThere is a bit of prep and\nclean-up required, but for\nthose wastey hangover\ndays it\u2019s perfect. Fill up\na sink with hot water and\nleave your equipment in\nthere to warm up a bit.\nGet some lube, and the\nrest is fairly self explan-atory. I\u2019s recommend\nyou make sure your toy\nis silicone. That way it\nlasts a long time and it\u2019s\ndishwasher safe for easy\nclean-up.\nRubber gloves\nWe\u2019re starting to get a bit\nalternative now. Rubber\ngloves are cheap and add\na new range of sensations to the masturbation\nexperience. The slightly\nreduced sensation on the\nhand gives a novel feeling\nwhich can be a lot of fun.\nIf rubber isn\u2019t your thing,\nyou could try other sorts\nof gloves to see if anything hits the spot.\nBum fun for boys\nIf you\u2019re a guy, you\u2019re\nlikely scared of having\nsomething in your bum.\nThat\u2019s perfectly natural.\nYou\u2019ve probably lived\nyour whole life only experiencing things coming out\nof it. Unpleasant things.\nI\u2019m not going to say that\nthe first time you try sticking something up there\nwill be a totally comfortable experience, but I\nsill say that perseverance\ncan yield unprecedented\nreward. If you ever pluck\nup the courage, have a\nlittle google and work out\nwhere your prostate is.\nAim for that with a finger\nwhile masturbating. If you\nget it right, you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s a thing.\nF-machine\nWhat if I told you could\ndelegate all that hard\nwork of pleasuring one of\nyour orifices to something\nwhich wouldn\u2019t cramp or\nfatigue? If that sounds\nappealing to you, and\nyou have an open minded\nfriend in mech-eng or\na decent budget, you\ncould consider a fucking\nmachine.

They don\u2019t always\nhave to be painful, but if\nyou\u2019re into that kind of\nthing then it\u2019s obviously\non the cards. If you look\nin the right place, you can\nget yourself electrodes\nfor the skin, insertable\nelectrodes or electro\nwands, which provide a\nlarge area of contact on\nthe end of a long handle.\nYou\u2019ll also have to pick\nup an electrostim box\nto plug them into. These\nallow you to control the\npulse frequency, intensity,\nchoose the waveform of\nthe pulses. Sometimes they\neven have an audio input,\nso you can sync your sexy\nshocks to your favourite\nsong.\nSounding\nThis is the last one on the\nlist, and probably the most\ncontroversial. Sounding\nis a name given to the act\nof putting things up your\nurethra. I can\u2019t personally comment on this but\nI\u2019ve been told it\u2019s like\nmasturbating from the\ninside. Generally, it\u2019s wise\nto start small, but with\nexperience, upgrading to\nlarger sizes is possible. If\nyou look online, you\u2019ll find\nsets of urethral sounds\nwith a range of girths. It\u2019s\nvery important here that\nyou look at reviews and\nmake sure your product is\nsterile to avoid infection.\nIt\u2019s generally not advisable to put random objects\nup your dick hole, so if\nyou want to try this you\nhave to go slow. Make\nsure you have a set of\nsmooth, clean sounds.\nIf any of these things\nhave enlightened you or\nsparked an interest, I\u2019m\nglad to have done my job.\nIf not, then there\u2019s always\nnext week.

This idea is explored\nwith a very simple premise;\na woman, in the wake of her\ndivorce, moves herself and\nher daughter to her brother\u2019s\nhome.\nThe three main characters\nall have their quirks and inner\ndemons they\u2019re trying to fight.\nValerie, the mother, is fresh\nout of a divorce and trying to\nget back into the dating scene\nand get some action. Alex,\nher brother, has a self-made\nfortune thanks to his dating\nsite, but personally struggles\nto find a meaningful relation-ship, instead taking part in\na series of one-night stands.\nFinally, we have Laura, the\nteen daughter, who deals with\nbeing a teenager in an age\nof social media panics and\nsexting, as well as an initial\ncrush on her teacher.\nThis is the kind of show that\u2019s\nbetter to binge-watch than\nwatch in weekly instalments.\nThe short format and solid\nperformances hook you in\nstraight away. Later, the characters are developed further\nand become more nuanced,\nleaving you more engrossed\nand intrigued by what\u2019s in\nstore. When you hear about\ntheir childhoods and learn\nhow damaged they all are,\nit explains much about their\npresent behaviour.\nFor example, Alex initially\ncomes off as a bit of a tool\nwho sleeps around with\nmultiple women. However, as\nhe matures and tries to get\ninto a long-term relationship\nof his own, his scenes end\nup becoming the most compelling material of the show.\nThere\u2019s an interesting role\nreversal between him and his\nsister; at the start, Val seems\nlike the responsible one and\nAlex the selfish narcissist, but\nhe starts to understand and\neven anticipate the consequences of his actions, while\nshe goes and has sex with her\nbrother\u2019s girlfriend.\nAs far as young teenage\ncharacters go, Laura is a\nrefreshing change of pace\nfrom the norm. She\u2019s fairly\ncomfortable in who she is\nand not ashamed of what she\nwants in a relationship. Her\nrelationship with her mother\nis open and frequently\npoignant. The two of them\nare more like friends who\ndiscuss the intimate details\nof their lives rather than a\ndistant mother and daughter.\nInterestingly, things between\nthem become a little shaky\nwhen Val tries to be a more\nresponsible mother at times.\nThe three characters form\nan odd, dysfunctional family\nunit, whose level of appropriateness is called on several\ntimes. They\u2019re able to vaguely\nfunction as human beings\nwhen they work together but\non a codependent, self-de-structive level that makes the\npossibility of broadening\ntheir circle beyond the three\nof them almost impossible.\nWhile none of them are perfect and perform not-so-great\nacts, the show is able to make\nyou empathize with the main\ncharacters even as it refuses\nto forgive them for their\nworst. The acting goes a long\nway in making you understand the characters.\nModern mother-daughter relationships\nare weird \\\\ Hulu\nVal seems the sanest of the\nbunch but her actions are the\nmost destructive. Through\nher expressions and scenes\nyou can see how and why\nshe chooses to go down the\nwrong path.\nIn the middle of all the\ncharacter drama, some\ninteresting ideas are tossed\naround and considered. If the\ninternet has made it easier to\nfind the right people for our\npersonal or social needs, then\nBeige surroundings for beige characters \\\\ Hulu\nwhy do we still form bonds\nwith people who disappoint\nus? Why do we adhere to\nthe same social structures\nfor so long when there are\nother options we could try?\nIt\u2019s when the show starts to\ntap into these questions and\nissues that it becomes more\nspecial and intriguing. Some\nrelationships hold themselves\ntogether out of inertia, but as\nthe show might suggest, some\nrun more deeply than we can\nunderstand.\nEven though the show\nmay be touted as a comedy,\nit\u2019s more half-hour drama\nthan funny, though its sharp\nobservations and moments\nmore than make up for it.\nIt has a very indie feel with\nstrong performances and\nwriting throughout. If\nyou\u2019re up for a fun,\nintrospective look\non relationships\nand one-offs,\nthis is a show\nto watch.\n\\\\ The three main\ncharacters all have\ntheir quirks and inner demons they\u2019re\ntrying to fight \\\\\n\\\\ As far as young\nteenage characters\ngo, Laura is a refreshing change of\npace from the norm\n\\\\\n\n"

We also provide the\nopportunity for those curious\nabout the Christian faith to\nfind people to direct their\nquestions to in a laid back\natmosphere. We ensure\nthat all members are well\nintegrated and feel at home\nwhen we are together \u2013\nwhether we are singing at the\ntop of our voices or stuffing\nour faces with food at one of\nour club socials.\nThe University Gospel Choir\nof the Year (UGCY) is like\nthe World Cup for University\ngospel choirs and we have\nmade the finals on 4 occasions \u2013 2011, 2012, 2013 and\n2015. However, in our four\nprevious attempts, we have\nnot managed to place in the\ntop three. This year we have\nmade it to the finals again\nunder very stiff competition\nwith many universities forming gospel choirs in recent\nyears. This is testament to the\nprogression of our choir over\nthe years and it is our hope\nthat this year, with all the\nmomentum we have gathered\nrecently, we will be able to\nplace in the top three.\nLast year, we celebrated our\n10th\nanniversary with ICGC\u2019s\nbiggest concert till date \u2013 welcoming over 100 spectators\nto St Paul\u2019s Hammersmith.\nThis was a turning point in\nthe history of the club, a\nclear sign of ICGC\u2019s growth\nand development as a choir\nand also as a family. The\nfaces of ICGC continuously\nchange but the vision has\nstayed constant \u2013 continuously infusing our passion for\nsinging with our passion for\nsharing the gospel message.\nThis vision has been the main\ndriving force for the ongoing\nimprovement in the quality of\nour performances.\nOur activities include regular performances at a variety\nof events such as: Supperclub\n(a dinner held for homeless\npeople), Ideal homeshow, at\nchurches, and at events put\non by Imperial societies. We\nhost our annual Christmas\nand Easter concerts with our\nEaster concert coming up on\nthe 14th\nof March, (6:30p.m.\nat St Alban\u2019s, Fulham, W6\n8H)\nThe details for UGCY are:\n18th\nMarch, 6:30pm, The Hippodrome, North End Road,\nGolders Green NW11 7RP.\nThe Imperial College Gospel Choir in concert \\\\ ICGC\nThe 2017 IC Cinema Spring All-Nighter\nSophie Sagawe\nT\nhis year\u2019s Spring\nAll-Nighter will take\nplace on Tuesday\nthe 21st\nof March\nat 6pm, ending\nat approximately\n7.45am the next day. For\nthose who are inexplicably out\nof the loop with this beloved\nImperial College tradition: it\u2019s\na whole night of films, shown\nback to back, on a screen 8\nmeters wide, for a tenner.

At a\nmale-dominated tech com-pany. Hidden Figures is the\ntrue story of three women, all\nbrilliant mathematicians, who\nmade significant contributions\nto the NASA missions that put\npeople into space, but had to\nfight tooth and nail to get the\nrecognition they deserved.\nEqual parts frustrating and\nuplifting, it\u2019s a film that\nreminds us how far we\u2019ve\ncome \u2013 and how far we still\nhave to go.\n23:05 T2 Trainspotting\nChoose Life. Choose\nImperial Cinema. Choose\nthe All-Nighter. Because\nit\u2019ll include the much-an-ticipated sequel to the 90s\ncult classic based on Irvine\nWelsh\u2019s novel. Can you think\nof a better way to spend two\nhours than in the company\nof a bunch of potty-mouthed,\nbackstabbing, violent, (ex-)\ndrug addicts with a lot of history to sort out? Ah cannae.\n01:15 Moonlight\nBarry Jenkins\u2019 Best Picture-winning film is the story\nof Chiron, who grows up on\na housing estate surrounded\nby poverty and violence. The\nstory is told in a triptych of\nlife-defining events from the\nperspective of child, adoles-cent, and young man, each\nportrayed by different actors.\nIt\u2019s full of sadness but simultaneously deeply moving in its\nexploration of themes such as\nidentity and love.

You\u2019re a\ntruck driver and your job is to make deliveries from one city to another. You\u2019re not even\nsupposed to drive crazily; you\u2019re supposed\nto obey the traffic laws and you actually get\npenalties for each one you violate. In spite of\nall this, it\u2019s actually really fun and satisfying,\nand because the gameplay is so chill, it makes\nyou feel pretty chill too. Any simulator game\ncan be played to get this feeling of enjoyment,\neven Goat Simulator! (Much lauded for its\naccurate representations of goats)\nAnimal Crossing | Any one\nThe main gist of any Animal Crossing game\nis that players move into a new town and\nspend their days building up relationships with\nvillagers, harvesting fruit, fishing, catching\nbugs, decorating their house, and tackling any\nof the almost innumerable other activities that\ncomprise one\u2019s Animal Crossing life. It doesn\u2019t\nsound like a to-do list that would necessarily\nmake for the most enthralling game, but that\u2019s\nexactly what it amounts to. There\u2019s something\nabout the relaxing rhythm of each activity that\nkeeps you coming back for more, bolstered by\nthe subtle yet effective way the game incentiv-izes you to keep playing, keep collecting, and\ngenerally keep on ticking.\nPok\u00e9mon | All games after\n2003\nPok\u00e9mon is a largely popular franchise and\nwhen you first look at it, it\u2019s hard not to see\nwhy. The games are filled with all sorts of col-ourful, cute and cool looking creatures which\nyou can capture, befriend and battle with. The\neternal quest to catch them all is a sure and\nfast way to get addicted and with no drastic\nelements like death or destruction, the kid-friendly games are a nice way to relax in your\ndown time. As a recommendation, only play\nthe games released after 2003 because that\u2019s\nwhen they really refined their gameplay; also\nbecause the original games do not age well.\nJust Cause 2 | The multiplayer\none\nJust Cause 2 isn\u2019t exactly the most relaxing\ngame. It has large maps and a huge variety of\nquests to complete. The free multiplayer mod\nhowever is just insane and open-ended fun.\nThere are no goals, no tasks, and no missions.\nYou spawn on the map in a complete free fall,\nwith as many as a thousand other players\nenjoying a giant sandbox of crazy. Join a race\nor a destruction derby, steal a plane and land\nit on a highway\u2014with your buddy riding up\ntop. Or just run around like a madman and\nshoot everyone in sight. If you ask yourself,\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d you\u2019re\nplaying it wrong.\nUndertale | Pacifist Path\nThis indie game made its appearance in\n2015 and was an instant hit. I definitely recommend it if you want to wind down but only on\nthe condition you do a pacifist run. When you\nplay the game this way, it\u2019s fun and endearing.\nYou\u2019re a little girl in a world of monsters and\nyou befriend them, interact with them and get\nto learn about all their quirks and backstories.\nIt\u2019s quite unlike any other RPG where you compliment and talk your way out of fights instead\nof taking part in them. That is of course, unless\nyou choose the genocide route where the\ngame is much shorter, and you literally feel like\nSatan once you\u2019re done.\nLittle Inferno | For Pyromaniacs\nThe point of this game is to just burn things\nin different ways and combinations; that\u2019s\nliterally it. It\u2019s been described as a game\nwith few objectives to complete and no way\nto lose. When you start burning things you\nbecome hypnotised as the realistic fire effects\nconsume everything in sight. Every once in a\nwhile burnt objects will drop coins, which you\ncan use to purchase bigger and better items to\nburn. It\u2019s basically a game to soothe your inner\nnine-year-old.\n\\\\ Nintendo\n\\\\ Toby Fox\n\\\\ Tomorrow Corporation\n\\\\ Avalanche Studios\n\\\\ Game Freak\nLife is tough and stressful, and often involves putting in way too much effort for very little gain. This is why a lot of people play video games, where virtual achievements\ncan make you feel good (for not doing much at all). Having said that many video games can actually be quite gruelling, making you stress out and forcing you to put in\nmaximum effort. Often, this can actually be more physically tiring and taxing than taking an exam in the Great Hall. But these are not the games we\u2019re going to be looking\nat today. In the spirit of self-care and without further ado, I\u2019m going to highlight some games which are not only fun to play but also extremely relaxing.\n\\\\ SCS Software\n\n"

During her\nspeech she introduced the\nlaunch of Women At Imperial\nCollege: Past, Present and\nFuture, written by Anne\nBarrett, College Archivist &\nCorporate Records Manager.\nThe book contains an \u2018amazing\nrecord of history\u2019 detailing\nthe role women have played\nin College since its inception\nand providing a guide to their\nachievements. In the words of\nProfessor Griffiths \u201cYou just\nhave to look at the book to see\nwhat you can do\u201d.\nThe real star of the speeches\nwas Rachel Blythe, who\ndiscussed her own experiences\ngrowing up in the middle\neast and the inherent sexism\nshe faced.

Last year\nsaw a 45.47% turnout which\nplaced Imperial College at the\ntop of the national democracy\nleaderboard. This year there\nseems to be a lower turnout\nin comparison to the last two\nyears. As of yet we\u2019ve officially\nfallen behind 2015\u2019s numbers\n(there\u2019s no point even talking\nabout a comparison with\n2016\u2019s turnout which we\u2019ve\nbeen behind since day one).\nThough there is a possibility\nthat Friday\u2019s last minute voting\nspike will see turnout reaching\nor even surpassing 2016\nand 2015 voter turnout, it is\nunlikely. Though marketing\nof the elections might be to\nblame in part, it is certainly\nalso a result of the pool of\ncandidates. There are only\nthirteen \u2018real\u2019 candidates\nand competition is much less\nintense this year, meaning\ncampaigning on campus\nhas similarly chilled out in\ncomparison to previous years.\nLooking at Faculty\nparticipation, we can see the\nFaculty of Engineering being\nso far the most involved, with\n2,898 out of 7,509 students\n(38.6%) having voted already.\nThe Faculty of Natural Science\nyear, half of the sabbatical\nofficers will be medics.

If\nyou\u2019re stressing out, stop. I was\ngoing to close with something\ncheesy like \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if\nyou lose, everyone\u2019s a winner\nwhen democracy works\u201d but\nthen again there\u2019s so little\ncompetition you literally have\na 50/50 chance of winning.\nSTAHP\n// ICU\nR\necent years show\nan alarming trend\namongst students.\nRising rates of\nmental illness\nshow little sign of\nslowing. In the past ten years,\nsuicide rates have almost\ndoubled. In York, up to 50%\nof ambulance call-outs to the\nuniversity were for self-harm\nor suicide attempts. This is a\nfar from localised issue\u2012 it\u2019s an\nepidemic.\nSome of the reasons\nbehind the skyrocketing levels\nof depression and anxiety\n(reported in the Independent\nas a 70% increase over\nthe past 25 years) seem so\nobvious it\u2019s almost surprising\nthey make the headlines.\nThe latest culprits are tuition\nfees and an ever-increasing\ncost of living (as all of us in\nLondon can attest to). What\nis worrying is the number of\nstudents that cannot afford to\npay rent (over a quarter) or\neven eat (39%) because of\ntheir lack of financial support.\nAnd while technically tuition\nfees shouldn\u2019t be a problem\nwhile still at university (due\nto the availability of student\nloans) that doesn\u2019t stop any\nof us worrying about our\naccumulating debt..\nOther common factors are\nall too familiar. Stress, alcohol,\na poor diet, and a lack of sleep\nand exercise have all been\ncited as contributors to poor\nHigher Education faces depression epidemic\nJoanna Wormald discusses the rise of mental illness across UK universities and efforts (or lack of)\nthat have been made to tackle student depression.\nmental health. Frustratingly,\nreports rarely seem to mention\nhow difficult it is to escape\nthese patterns when you have\na mental illness. It\u2019s hard to go\nto the gym and eat healthily\nwhen you barely have the\nenergy to drag yourself into\nlectures each day (hardly a\nunique experience for students\nand perhaps one reason it\ncan be so tricky to recognise\ndepression). And sleep doesn\u2019t\ncome easily when you\u2019ve\nspent all night worrying about\nyour next assignment.\nA recent review into the\nculture at Imperial revealed\na particularly adverse\nenvironment when it comes to\nfostering good mental health.\nResearchers created a word\ncloud describing the culture\nat Imperial using responses\nfrom surveyed participants.\nAlthough there were 246\npositive descriptors, 186\nwere negative, and a further\n213 deemed ambiguous.\nHighlightsinclude:\u201ccut-throat\u201d,\n\u201cabusive\u201d, \u201cauthoritarian\u201d,\nand \u201chomogeneous\u201d (in case\nyou\u2019d forgotten that we\u2019re\nall scientists). Furthermore,\nthe pressure to live up to\nImperial\u2019s reputation for\nexcellence leaves many\nstudents feeling alienated and\nin constant competition with\ntheir peers. None of this is\nexactly conducive to a happy\nstudent population. So what\ncan be done about it?\nStudents can receive\nindividual support from the\nCollege\u2019s Student Mental\nHealth Advisers (SMHA)\nbut only if referred by a staff\nmember. This risks leaving\nmany students without help\nsince those with mental\nhealth issues can find it\ndifficult to reach out to others\nand members of staff may\nnever even realise that a\nstudent is struggling. Those\nwith a referral must wait\nuntil a suitable appointment\nbecomes available. The\nImperial website gives no\nindication of how long this\ntakes on average and at time\nof writing, the mental health\nservice has not responded to\nour requests for comment. If\nother universities are anything\nto go by, it doesn\u2019t look good.\nMany students have to wait\nweeks before receiving an\nappointment, during which\ntime their condition can rapidly\ndeteriorate with dangerous\neffects.\nIf face-to-face counselling\nisn\u2019t an option, there\u2019s the\npossibility of doing it over\nemail. This pilot scheme was\nlaunched at the start of the\ncurrent academic year and\nallows students to self-refer\n(although you do have to\nfill in a registration form\nand questionnaire to check\nyour suitability). If accepted,\nstudents are initially offered\nfour email exchanges with a\ncounsellor (with the possibility\nof adding an extra four\nsessions if necessary). The\nservice is aimed at students\nwho spend most of their time\noff-campus (e.g. on work\nplacements) but could be a\nreal help for those who have\ndifficulties vocalising their\nemotions.\nOf course there are some\ndownsides. Confidentiality\nproblems are solved fairly\neasily by handling emails\nin private. A trickier issue\nhowever is that emails can\u2019t\nconvey physical and verbal\ncues so miscommunication\nhas the potential of becoming\na real issue. Additionally,\nonly being able to send\none email per appointment\nmakes it harder to maintain a\ncontinuous dialogue.\nTackling the mental health\ncrisis isn\u2019t just a matter of hiring\nmore professionals (although\nbetter student to staff ratios\nwould certainly help). Sir\nAnthony Seldon, ViceChancellor at the University\nof Buckingham and a vocal\ncommentator on student\nmental health, recommends\na \u201ccollegiate atmosphere\u201d\nand \u201csense of community\u201d\nwithin universities things\nImperial has been criticised\nas lacking but could easily\nrectify by providing more\ncommunal spaces. Finally, we\nneed to challenge the stigma\naround mental illness. Our\nmale-dominated culture of\nexcellence may make students\neven less likely to admit to\nneeding help. We shouldn\u2019t let\nstudents in need slip through\nthe cracks.\nThe College\u2019s 2015-2020 strategy promises to\n\u201cbe mindful of the need to\npromote good mental health\u201d\nand \u201cprioritise the mental wellbeing of the student body\u201d.\nWhether this will be effective\nremains to be seen.\n\\\\ Many students\nhave to wait weeks\nbefore receiving\nan appointment,\nduring which time\ntheir condition can\nrapidly deteriorate\nwith dangerous\neffects \\\\\n\\\\ A recent review\ninto the culture at\nImperial revealed\na particularly\nadverse environment\nwhen it comes to\nfostering good\nmental health \\\\\n\\\\ A pilot scheme\nwas launched at the\nstart of the current\nacademic year and\nallows students to\nself-refer (although\nyou do have to fill in\na registration form\nand questionnaire\nto check your\nsuitability) \\\\\nThe wordcloud from the institutional culture report \\\\ Imperial College\n\n"

So that\nyou too can treat yourselves to an\nexcellent meal out, we\u2019ve arranged\nan exclusive Imperial discount.\nT\no look on at the birth\nof a new restaurant\nis always exciting \u2013\nI\u2019ve been a part of\nit, having seen the\nplace I worked at in\nOxford rise from the ashes\nof a mediocre Italian cocktail\nbar, and realising that I really\nwanted to be a part of that.\nTeething problems ranged\nfrom gutters that drained into\nthe balcony (we bailed it out\nwith saucepans, literally) to\nmuch more minor tweaks, like\nwho supplied our bread. The\ntentative first few months were\nsome of the most stressful\nand intense that I have ever\nworked. It was therefore\namazing to me to step into\nthe fresh faced Ceru, in South\nKensington, and witness a\npolished, refined machine that\nwas only three months into its\noperation. I\u2019d cycled past it\nfor the few months that it took\nto strip away the previous\noccupant and revitalise the\ninteriors, and so knew that it\nwas absolutely brand new,\nand yet when I went, it looked\nlike it had been a local fixture\nfor ages. So how had they\ndone it?\nSimple \u2013 they\u2019d meticulously\nplanned before they opened.\nBarry and Patricia Hilton,\nthe husband-and-wife team\nbehind Ceru, tested many of\nthe ideas beforehand with\ntheir successful pop-up under\nthe same name \u2013 visiting\nfestivals, private dinners\nand shows to serve simple,\nyet delicious dishes from the\nLevant to a huge audience.\nIt\u2019s reasonable therefore\nto say that they have some\nexperience, and inside the\nrestaurant it shows. I\u2019ve\nvisited twice now \u2013 for a\npost exam lunch, and a more\nrelaxed breakfast. The former\ntrip was an escape from the\ndrizzle we have been used\nto over the past few months,\nand the cosy booths, lit with\nbeautiful geometric lighting\non the walls behind, provided\na warm embrace to whip\naway any memories of either\nthe weather, or the equally\nmiserable exam that I had just\nsat. And yet when I visited\non a bright spring morning\nlast week, it was equally\nas homely in the early rays\nof sunshine that were just\npeeking under the deep blue\nawning. The whole restaurant\ntook on a brilliant palette of\ncolours, with the patterned\nseating, tiles and lights\ntransporting me straight back\nto one of the many caf\u00e9s in\nIstanbul \u2013 one of my favourite\ncities, especially for food and\ndrink.\nPost exam, we decided that\ncocktails were a necessary\nfix for our mood. A Cucumber Martini (made without\nHendricks, something I am\npersonally glad to see the\nend of) and a delightful gin-and-Campari based Trouble\nin Paradise quickly lifted our\nspirits, and in perfect sync\nwith the cocktails arrived the\nfirst dishes, a rarity in some\nrestaurants these days. With\ntheir tagline of \u201cShare the\nflavours of The Levant\u201d, don\u2019t\nexpect dainty portions for\nyou to nibble at and politely\nenquire how everyone is\nenjoying their food \u2013 you\u2019ll\nwant to ask your lab partner\nfor some of their creamy\nroasted aubergines with\npiquant, earthy chermoula,\nand expect to trade it for suc-culent, tender lamb shoulder\n\u2013 two of my favourite dishes,\nand both wonderfully exe-cuted: the lamb not too fatty,\nyet unctuous still, and the\naubergines roasted enough\nto give a smoky tang but not\nan ashtray like sting. The\nVillage Salad cleansed us in\nbetween mouthfuls, providing\na wonderful fresh contrast\nand packing flavours of its\nown, with fried capers and\nsumac to give it body.

I mean I\nonly noticed as\nthe women in\nmy office were doing even less\nwork than they usually do and I\nassumed they were celebrating\nthe fact that they menstruate\nonce a month or something like\nthat. I don\u2019t really understand\nwhat there is to celebrate about\nconsistently earning less than\nyour male equivalent for the same\njob or having to repeatedly fight\nfor your right to choose whether\nor not you have a baby, but it\nhas been medically proven that\nwomen have smaller brains than\nmen (Borat et al, 2006) so that\nmay play a role in it. Apparently\nthere is an international men\u2019s\nday on November which doesn\u2019t\nreally make much sense to me\nsince being a white man is reason\nto celebrate each and every\nday so why do we only get one\nrecognised day.\nI hear that the theme of this\nweek\u2019s rag is some neo-liberal shit\nabout self care. There is only one\nimportant self-care protocol that I\nfollow and that involves firmly gripping your genitals and rhythmically\nrubbing them \u2013 I don\u2019t need any\nknown homosexuals telling me this.\nI have to say it\u2019s not a big surprise\nthat these liberals are asking for\ntime to self-care when they\u2019ve been\nreceiving hand outs every day of\ntheir life \u2013 they\u2019ve self-cared too\nmuch I think. Look at the NHS \u2013\nthese junior doctors have probably\ncaught wind of this idea, and think\nthey need to work less hours for\ntheir self-care \u2013 here\u2019s an idea\nDO SOME FUCKING WORK.\nThey spend six year\u2019s drinking\nand fucking each other and then\nat the very end they want to complain about doing a day\u2019s work.\nScroungers. All of them. I\u2019ll tell\nyou why there\u2019s a bed shortage:\ntoo many fatties being too lazy.\nYes you\u2019ve got cancer, but you still\nhave legs right? Think of all the\ncoma patients that are wasting\nvaluable space \u2013 if they\u2019re not\nconscious, they\u2019re not in need of\na bed. As long as you keep them\naway from any 70\u2019s BBC television\nstars, then there is no reason not\nto just put them all in one room \u2013\nmaybe stack them?\nOh yeah don\u2019t forget to vote\nin the ICU elections so that I can\nget my free drinks in on Friday.\nThis rag needs to be reduced to a\nPDF as soon as possible so that I\ncan spend the column money on\nlubricant.

Whenever I\nget stressed by current\nevents or the anxiety\nof having my parents\npaying for this three year holiday\n(my English literature degree),\nI go through my regime, and I\ncome through the other side,\nready to face whatever trolls have\ncommented on my vegan cooking\nblog this week. As a side note, can\npussydestroyer457 please stop\nposting photos of pornstars with\nAlice Gast\u2019s face photoshopped\nonto them and calling me a fag.\nThanks. I start my regiment off with\nbathing in lightly sweetened soya\nmilk, making sure I wash below\nthe glans and right in the urethra\nas there is no sweeter feeling than\na dairy-free urethra. The next step\nis some nice exfoliation using the\nfinest pumice from Bolivia and a\nlittle bit of jellyfish extract (vegan\nof course) mixed in with hummus\n(well I\u2019m white aren\u2019t I). I then\nstart by focussing on my testicles,\nmaking sure to get rid of all the\nexcess skin and bran flakes that\nhave accrued there.\nOnce I have taken care of the\nskin situation, I then move onto\nmy haircare regimen involving\nvarious serums and conditioners,\nall overpriced but cruelty free.\nFirst I use my avocado and quinoa\nhair serum (Editor\u2019s note: This is\ngenuinely a real vegan shampoo.\nThey are beyond parody) [Real\nEditor\u2019s note: This may or may not\nbe true], first taking two handfuls\nand gently rubbing them into my\npubic area; however, I do have\nto remain vigilant, as you\u2019d be\nsurprised how quickly this can turn\ninto me wanking. Next I move onto\nthe cauliflower conditioner which is\nimportant for maintaining the gloss\nand modest scent of vegetables,\nan essential quality for me in day\nto day life. Eventually I move onto\nthe hair on my head, but as you\nguessed, the secret to a happy life\nis well kept balls, and so I rub this\ngood stuff all over the wrinkles and\ncrevasses. Whilst doing this you\nmay also find time to investigate\nyour gonads for any lumps and\nbumps in order to detect whether\nor not you have any tumours;\nhowever, once again I would\nadvise readers to be careful when\nperforming this procedure as it has\nled to many a wank on my part.\nOnce the body has been taken\ncare of, the mind must also be\ncomforted. For me this consists\nof going onto the KFC Facebook\npage and commenting on every\npost about the amount of carbon\nthat eating chicken creates. Of\ncourse once again I have to ensure\nthat I don\u2019t masturbate to my sheer\nwittiness, but often I fail, leading\nto me having to clean the laptop\nwith recycled tissues. I feel very\nself-cared for though.\nI constantly self-care\nand no, I don\u2019t mean\nwank... mostly\nJonathan Masters\u2019 takes us\nthrough his daily regimen of\nself-care, which mostly involves\nslathering lotions on their bod\nYou don\u2019t need to\nself-care, you\u2019re on\nconstant holiday\nyou student scum\nMonathan Jasters doesn\u2019t need to\nself-care, he\u2019s a man who has an\nobedient woman caring for him\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nMen\u2019s rights\n\n"

Several\nstudents from America took an\ninternship with the company\u2019s\nNew York office following his\nsuccess in the competition.\nThe questions from CodeCon\nhave been used throughout\nthe world; more than 15,000\nparticipants have used its\nbrowser based e-Learning tool\nto sharpen up their coding\nskills.\nL\nondon has been\nhost to amazing\ncompetitions in recent\nyears. We hosted the\nOlympic Games in\n2012 and shows like\nThe X Factor and Britain\u2019s\nGot Talent have been world\nrenowned hits for the better\nhalf of a decade, but last\nJanuary, London was host to a\ndifferent kind of competition,\none that it was no surprise to\nsee Imperial students thriving\nin.\nOn 27 January, London\u2019s\nBloomberg office was host\nto Global CodeCon Finals\n(GCCF), a two-hour long\ncompetition between 140\nof the top coders from\nuniversities and colleges\nthroughout the world. Four\nImperial students were finalists\nin the competition that hosted\n45 different schools from all\nover Europe, the U.S. and\nCanada. Szilveszter Szekely,\nJacek Burys, Mihai Popa Dan\nAlex and Paul Gramatovici,\nproudly represented Imperial.\nBloomberg engineer,\nRangan Prabhakaran, created\nthe competition in 2014 with\nthe intention to incentivize\nstudentstoimprovetheircoding\nabilities through competition.\nThroughout the whole of last\nyear, competitions were held\nat universities with strong\ncomputer science programs\nall over the world. The winners\nof these competitions were\ninvited to London and New\nYork for the finals.\nBloomberg software\nengineers created all of the\nquestions in the final event.\nSimilar to a final exam, all of\nthe questions were kept secret\nfrom competitors; the different\npuzzles and questions were\npresented in random patterns\nmeant to stump competitors.\n\u201cThe contest itself was\nvery intense, as solving the\ntasks quickly was crucial.\u201d\nSaid Mihai Popa, one of\nthe finalists from Imperial.\n\u201cWhen coding, you must be\nconfident in your thoughts, it\nis a demanding activity which\nrequires sustained training.\nAt the Bloomberg CodeCon\nfinals, I feel that the main\ndifficulty was implementing\nthe solutions to the problems\nrather discovering the actual\nsolutions.\u201d He said.\nOnly one participant was\nable to answer every one\nof the questions and he was\neventually crowned winner of\nthe competition. One question\nwould ask students to arrange\nantique statues by height in\nas few moves as possible, the\nnext may ask them to write a\nprogram to win at Pok\u00e9mon\nGo. According to Bloomberg\u2019s\nblog covering the event, one\nquestion in particular, dubbed\n\u201cFirefighter Tim\u201d gained some\nnotoriety for its difficulty.\nIt had only a two percent\nsuccess rate across the 140\nfinalists. The question tasked\nstudents to write algorithms,\ntest optimizations, and create\ndifferent data structures to\nsave as many people as\npossible from the burning\nwalls of a building, all with a\nlimited amount of water. The\nBloomberg software engineer\nI\nf you walk through Beit\nQuad, you\u2019re more likely\nthan not to find at least\none person wearing\nsome sort of flashy outfit.\nImperial is not known for\nany sort of fashion programs\nbut students still love to flex\ntheir personal styles, whether\nit\u2019s the preppy jocks from the\nRugby team or flannel clad\nhipsters from the art clubs.\nLondon\u2019s fashion week has\ncome and gone but that has not\nstopped streetwear fanatics\nfrom throughout the world\nfrom continuously shopping\nthroughout the SOHO area.\nSupreme, a skateboard and\nstreetwearcompanybasedout\nof New York has been making\nwaves in the high fashion\nindustry with a collaborative\ncollection with Louis Vuitton\nfrom Paris\u2019 fashion week last\nmonth. Supreme\u2019s store in\nLondon had a massive queue\nof over 150 guests, cloaked\nin popular brands like Palace,\nTommy Hilfiger, Thrasher, and\nof course Supreme. All of who\nhoped to get their hands on\ntheir latest drop of clothing.\nEvery Thursday morning,\nSupreme releases new clothes\nin stores throughout the world\nand on-line. Though the drops\nare frequent, supplies are\nlimited so once the stock sells\nout, there is no more supply,\ncausing a high demand for\nall things Supreme and prices\nto skyrocket on the resale\nmarket.\nThe queue formed several\nblocksawayfromthestoreand\nwrapped around the block in\nan alley plagued by violent\ngusts of wind. No items from\nthe Louis Vuitton collaboration\nwere on sale, but that didn\u2019t\nstop shoppers from buying\nmost of the inventory stock\nin the store and on sale. By\n14:00 almost every top and\nhat that Supreme had debuted\nthat day had sold out online\naccording to their website.\nTim Collins, a teenager from\nBlackwater, was at the front\nof the queue and had gotten\nthere at 7:00, four hours\nbefore doors opened. It was\nhis first time buying Supreme\nthe day it came out at the\nstore. \u201cEvery other time I\u2019ve\nbought clothes, I just got them\nonline or from my mates.\u201d He\nsaid.\nAnother teenager that was\nskipping school for the drop\nwas named Vova, a 14 year\n\\\\ Four Imperial\nstudents were\nfinalists in the\ncompetition that\nhosted 45 different\nschools \\\\\nOnly 2% of people were able to\nsave lives \\\\ Peretz Partensky\n\\\\ Only one\nparticipant was able\nto answer every one\nof the questions \\\\\nFashion reigns Supreme\nMatt Rego\nold who had travelled all the\nway from Russia.\nThe guests were not just\nteenagers though; a 25 year\nold from Brunswick said that\nthis was his seventh time\nwaiting in the queue. \u201cI never\nbuy online. I always come\nhere for my clothes.\u201d He said.\nThe next day, Palace\nSkateboards released their\nline of items for the Spring\nand Summer seasons; massive\ncrowds lined up outside the\nLondon based streetwear\ncompany\u2019s shop in SOHO\nfor their one and only\ndrop.\nQS World Rankings by subject released\nGender equality comes to the forefront\nLef Apostolakis\nglobal academic rankings.\nCambridge still reigns\nsupreme. It ranks in the top\nten for more subjects than any\nother institution in the world\n(36) and UK unis take just\nover one-third of all top-three\npositions, and over a quarter\nof all top ten positions.\nQS Head of Research, Ben\nSowter, said: \u201cIf last autumn\u2019s\noverall rankings suggested\nthe winds of winter blowing\ntowards the UK\u2019s higher\neducation system, this year\u2019s\nsubject rankings \u2013 enabling\nobservers to drill down into\nuniversity performance more\ndeeply \u2013 provide a less chilling\nforecast. Though the UK does\nsee its share of overall places\ndecrease, this is a trend\nobserved by institutions in the\nUS, Canada, and Australia,\nas other nations grow\nincreasingly competitive.\nWe observe nations in\nboth Eastern Europe and\nAsia \u2013 most notably Russia\nand China \u2013 increasing their\noverall share. However, the\nupper echelons of the tables\nremain dominated by the US\nand UK, and this seems likely\nto continue for the foreseeable\nfuture.\u201d\nT\nhe QS university\nrankings have\njust released a\nbreakdown of\nranking by subject\nand while UK\nuniversities remain global\nleaders in higher education it\nwould appear that competition\nkeeps getting more intense\neach year.\nThe latest instalment of the\nrankings takes into account\n46 different Subjects and five\ncomposite Subject Areas.\nInitial results show the UK\ntaking the lead in eight\nsubjects, including Anatomy\nand Physiology, Archaeology,\nDevelopment Studies,\nEducation, English Language\nand Literature, Geography,\nand Sports Related Subjects.\nImperial landed on ninth\nplace this year and was\novertaken by three UK\ninstitutions, with UCL taking\nseventh place, the University\nof Oxford taking sixth\nplace and the University\nof Cambridge, the highest\nscoring UK university landing\non fourth place.\nIn Engineering and\nTechnology related subjects,\nSo at least we\u2019ve got that\ngoing for us.\nOut of the Engineering\nand Tech subjects that were\nevaluated, Imperial\u2019s strongest\nwas Civil and Structural\nEngineering coming fourth\nglobally just after Cambridge,\nwhile it scored lowest in\nComputer Science related\nsubjects which placed twelfth.\nHowever all Engineering and\nTech degrees still managed to\nbag a top ten spot.\nOut of the Life Sciences and\nMedical Subjects that were\nevaluated, Imperial\u2019s most\ninternationally competitive\ndegrees were its Medical\ndegrees,in12th\nplace,followed\nby Biological Science degrees\nin 19th\nplace and finally by\nPharmacology degrees in 26th\nplace. Imperial fell behind\nCambridge and Oxford in all\nthree categories but scored\nhigher in Biological Science\ndegrees than UCL.\nFinally out of its\nNatural Science degrees,\nEnvironmental Sciences\nscored the highest coming in\nninth while Earth and Marine\nScience degrees scored the\nlowest landing on 26th\nplace.\nNo other Natural Science\ndegrees got in the top ten.\nThis meta-analysis is an\naddition to the rankings which\nwere originally released\nearlier in September 2016.\nThe rankings saw Imperial fall\nto ninth place, from eighth in\n2015 and joint second with\nCambridge in 2014, scoring\n94.1 overall.

Most recently with\na glowing 69-10 win over\nKingston and a 38-5 win\nagainst Roehampton the week\nbefore, propelling Women\u2019s\nRugby into the South-Eastern\nConference Cup Semi-Finals.\nThis improvement can in part\nbe attributed to the decision\nto focus solely on the BUCS\nleague, and the organisation\nof weekly weight lifting\nsessions to supplement their\ntraining.\nThe match against\nRoehampton got off to a blistering start, with the first half\ndominated by Imperial and\nCaptain Charlotte scoring a\ntry within the first play. This\nwas followed by a somewhat\nfrustrating 20 minutes as the\nball always remained within\na quarter-pitch of the try line,\nbut always unable to reach\nit. A couple of quicker pops\nto the wings as Imperial\u2019s\nforwards were tackled could\nhave seen a better progression up the pitch, but\nproficient rucking over of all\nthe takedowns and keeping\nball possession throughout\nwas a strongpoint of Imperial\u2019s game. This stationary\nperiod was ended when\nforward Laura broke through\ntwo Roehampton players to\nscore a try. The game was\npaused shortly after as kicker\nMoran successfully converted\na little too enthusiastically,\nthe ball flying over a fence\nand into a river carrying it\ndownstream, never to be\nseen again. Several valiant\nrescue attempts were made,\nbut alas - they don\u2019t make\nthem like they used to and no\nplayer was willing to jump\ndown the two metre concrete\nembankment. To finish an epic\nfirst half Charlotte scored her\nsecond try of the match, with\na hat-trick in sight. 19-0.\nThe second half began\nwith ten minutes of intense\nThisSoggyCockneyisnowetdog\nJanice Pun\nwith old windsurfing kit\nand DJ-ed by our very own\nMC-Ooper. Saturday night\nled us to Walkabout, Temple.\nThe theme of the night was\nCockney Rhyming Slang. This\nled to funny looks on the tube\nwith outlandish costumes such\nas Birmingham\u2019s Bees and\nHoney, and Imperial\u2019s Cows\nand Kisses! After partying\naway, all visiting students\nwere hosted by the Imperial\nWindsurfing committee in\ntheir cosy houses. The hordes\nwere fed with pasta bake on\nSaturday night and bacon\nbutties on both mornings.\nWe would like to thank\nSport Imperial and the SWA\nfor supporting us throughout\nour event preparation and\nmaking this incredible weekend possible.\nL\nondon took centre\nstage on the weekend\nof the 17th\nto 19th\nFebruary as over\n130 windsurfers\nfrom universities\nacross the UK descended\non the capital to share in\nthe thrill of Imperial College\nLondon\u2019s brand new student\nwindsurfing event: London\nCalling! Despite light winds\nthe weekend was a rip\nroaring success and a huge\ncelebration of sport with\nthe horizon scattered with\nwindsurf sails taking in the\nFebruary sun. The Student\nWindsurfing Association\n(SWA) certainly made the\nmost of the many activities\nheld both on and off the\nwater. This weekend will not\nbe forgotten easily and will\nbe the first of many to come.\nLondon Calling, aka. Soggy\nCockney, was the last of the\nthree SWA core events held\nthis academic year in association with Sport Imperial and\nQueen Mary Reservoir. This\nhuge inter-university collaboration attracted windsurfing\nclubs from every corner of the\nUK. Some clubs even braved\na seven hour haul through\nrush hour traffic to join the\nfray.\nThe windsurfing was spread\nover both days, with Saturday\u2019s main focus on personal\ndevelopment. Despite the\ncalm water, eight windsurfing clinics hosted by student\ninstructors and Queen Mary\nSailing Club instructors\nwere held. Different levels\nof clinics were put on for\nbeginners, intermediate and\nadvanced windsurfers. The\nwind remained calm so on\nSaturday afternoon we held\nthe Soggy Cockney Low Wind\nOlympics. Students competed\non the backs of beginner\nboards with tug of war, sprints\nand tag featuring among the\nrounds.\nOn Sunday the wind picked\nup a bit. Windsurfing competitions of different levels\nincluding beginner, intermedi-ate, advanced and freestyle\nwere held. Team racing\nhowever was where Imperial\nwindsurfing excelled, ranking\n4th\nout of 14 other university\nteams. The freestyle is always\na spectacle, incorporating\nimpressive tricks and jumps as\nwindsurfers show off to earn\npoints for their universities.\nBesides windsurfing, we\nhosted two after parties.\nFriday night was a private\nparty in Reynolds, decorated\nmiddle play, Roehampton\nmissing a key opportunity to\nkick the ball away from their\nhalf, leading to back Anna\ncapitalising on a dropped\nball, grabbing it and double\ndodging to a try. There were\ntwo further tries by Imperial\nbefore a huge opposing push\ntowards the end saw Roehampton score their first and\nonly counter try of the game.\nFinal match score 38-8, a\ngreat performance with a\nwide range of players scoring\ntries and conversions.\n\\\\ The takedowns\nand keeping\nball possession\nthroughout was\na strongpoint of\nImperial\u2019s game \\\\\nImmortalsthroughtosemi-finals\nImraj Singh\nD\nefeated,\ndowntrodden,\nbut with a\nfervent desire\nto win; that\u2019s\nhow we entered\nthe season. As Drake so\neloquently put it, \u201cstarted\nfrom the bottom now we\u2019re\nhere\u201d. After a winless season\nlast year we have now risen\nto the top. A new coaching\nsquad and great new recruits\n(as well as veteran players)\nhas enabled us to maintain a\nflawless home record. Since\nwe are top of our division\nour first playoff game was\nat fortress Harlington. We\nwill ensure that no team\ndesecrates our sacred\nrunway. We surely won\u2019t\nallow any Demons to ravage\nit. Last Sunday we came\nready to defend our ground\nagainst the 5-3 record Exeter\nDemons in the Southern 1st\ndivision Quarter-final. And\ndefend it we did.\nFirst half saw defence\ndominate on both teams. A\nfew lapses in concentration\nallowed the Demon\u2019s Quarterback to escape outside\npicking up a few yards,\nalso, as if recently escaped\nfrom hell, their running back\nbarrelled his way through\nthe Immortals Defensive line.\nThese advances were stopped\nby Jason \u2018The Enforcer\u2019\nPatrick Kuilan, with some\nsavage hits, he ensured they\ndid not want to make it to\nthe second level again. Due\nto the weather conditions,\nboth teams\u2019 offense were\nvery dependent on ground\nand pound run games. The\neffects of this playing style\ncan certainly be felt the day\nafterwards. Lots of aches\nand bruises, but fortunately\nthere are no lasting injuries.\nA standout player on the day,\nfor causing much disruption in\nthe Demon\u2019s run game, was\nKem \u2018The Furious Confusion\u2019\nSmooth. He often found himself in the back field, much to\nhis own amazement as much\nas anyone else\u2019s, getting\nsacks. This is his second ever\ngame playing American Football and second week playing\ndefence. For his crazily athletic plays he was awarded\n\u2018best rookie defensive player\u2019\non the day. The offensive\nside of the ball was rather\nunproductive, and it seemed\nto take a while for them to\nwarm up and start to record\nsome yards.\nThe second half was much\nmore eventful on offence. This\nwas mainly attributed to Guillaume \u2018postcorner\u2019 Fontan\u2019s\nvery physical and aggressive\nrunning. Tumbling, crashing\nand pummelling through the\nDemon\u2019s defence; he ensured\nthat we got the yardage we\nneeded. For his monumental effort on offence (and\ndefence), regardless of the\nfact he was playing through\nbad shoulder injuries, he\nwas awarded offensive MVP.\nOne humble hero that made\nmany of these plays possible,\nmaking massive holes for\nwhich G to pass through,\nwas Zinedine Da-Sam Hill.\nWithout his aggressive\nblocking, that caused many\na pancake to be formed, the\noffense would not have been\nable to function. He has been\nthe staple of the offense for\nmany years, but recently he\nhas made appearances on\ndefence where he made great\nplays too. Although offensive\nand defensive line are not\nthe most glamorous positions,\nthey are vital to the success\nof a team. The overall MVP,\nin perhaps one of the most\nexciting games of Immortals\nhistory (a bold statement),\nwas awarded to Shill. A\nplayer that has been selflessly\ndedicated to the team over\nthe last few years; the award\ncould not have been better\ndeserved. Another humble\nand very important role was\nplayed by rookie John \u2018Clay\nMatthews\u2019 Lister, whose\nplays at offensive line gave\nhim Lineman MVP. Without\nthe offensive line stepping\nup the team would not have\nbeen able to win. Immortals\ndefence were as dominant\nas always ensuring that no\nDemon could score touch-downs. Unfortunately the\nDemon\u2019s defence was equally\nimpenetrable.\nLate in the fourth quarter\nthe score was still 0-0. Immortals had been unable to drive\nsuccessfully, the Demon\u2019s\noffense were handed the\nball with less than a minute\nto go. They started marching\nup the field toward our\nendzone. Our defence, that\nhad been consistent all day,\nseem strained by the rallying\nDemon\u2019s. The tension was\npalpable on the Immortals\nside line; this was do or die.\nEvery sinew of our heart,\nmind and soul had been sown\ninto the fabric of each game\nwe played. We wore this\ncape into every battle as a\nmemory of how far we had\ncome. From relegation to top\nof the league had required\na ferocious desire to win.\nWe still had that desire as\nthe Demons made it well into\nfield goal range\u2026 We finally\ncurbed their advances, but\nthis time it was too late. The\nDemons were only 15 yards\nfrom the uprights. All they\nneeded was a field goal to\nsecure the win. We had failed\nMother Harlington. But she\ndid not fail us. At the moment\nthe field goal was going to\nbe taken Mother Harlington\nstruck the field with great\nvengeance and furious anger.\nA hailstorm made it impossible to make the kick, and the\ngame ticked over into sudden\ndeath overtime.\nAfter Mother Harlington\nsmiled down on us, we\nprotected her yet again and\ncame away with the win. 6-3,\nthe Demon\u2019s managed to get\na field goal but we scored\na touchdown. We are now\noff to the Southern Division\n1 Semi-finals against the\nCardiff Cobras. #BecomeIm-mortal #SnakeHunting\n#TopOfTheLeague\n\\\\ We had failed\nMother Harlington.\nBut she did not fail\nus \\\\\n\\\\ Defeated,\ndowntrodden but\nwith a fervent desire\nto win \\\\\n\n"

The women\nat its centre are tangentially\nrelated to each other, but\nnever really meet; they are\ntrapped within their own\nworlds. Laura Dern is a\nlawyer dealing with a difficult\nclient, who refuses to listen to\nher advice about a personal\ninjury claim. Dern plays her\ncharacter with great depth,\neach subtle movement revealing the frustrations of not\nbeing heard on account of\nher gender. \u201cIt\u2019d be so lovely\nto think that if I were a man\nand I could explain a law\nmatter, which is handled\nwith delicacy and grace. The\ncrushing weight of isolation\nis borne with a lightness of\ntouch; her characters have a\nsense of tragedy surrounding\nthem, but they themselves are\nnever viewed as tragic \u2013 they\nare the heroes of their own\nstories.\nTo me, the closest comparison to Reichardt\u2019s work is\nnot to be found in other films,\nbut rather in the work of\nEdward Hopper, that American painter who masterfully\nconveyed the experience\nof being isolated amongst\nothers. Certain Women is like\nHopper\u2019s canvases, acting as\na postcard from the edge of\nsolitude. Both Reichardt and\nHopper act, in the words of\nOlivia Laing, \u2018as if loneliness\nwas something worth looking\nat\u2019 \u2013 and this is an act of high-lighting, of thrusting forward\ninto the spotlight, that takes\nsupreme artistic courage.\nCertain Women is allowed\nto unfold at its own steady\npace \u2013 Reichardt never\nattempts to rush forward the\naction, but instead lets the\nnarrative reveal itself organ-ically. She is not interested\nin large dramas, or epic\nclimaxes, but lets her camera\nlinger on the minutiae of\neveryday life; what could be\nmore authentic than a lived\nreality? Reichardt shows us\nthat everyone has their own\nstory, and everyone is worth\nlistening to. Certain Women\nis affirming in the truest sense\nof the word \u2013 by exalting\nand elevating the individual\nhuman experience, Reichardt\nhas created a film with\nempathy, grace, and deep\nhumanity.\nFred Fyles\nKelly Reichardt fashions a\nbeautifully-intimate portrait of\nfour women, in her sixth feature\nfilm, Certain Women, which\ndetails our relationships with the\nnatural world, other individuals,\nand our own loneliness\n\\\\ Reichardt\u2019s films\ncentre around\nthe normal day-to-day lives of\naverage Americans,\nportraying their\nstruggles, their\ndefeats, and their\nsmall triumphs with\na relentless internal\nenergy and endless\nempathy \\\\\npeople would listen and say\n\u2018Okay.\u2019,\u201d Laura reports to a\nfriend, \u201cOh, that would be so\nrestful.\u201d\nLike Laura, Gina (Michelle\nWilliams \u2013 in her third outing\nwith Reichardt) is used to not\nbeing listened to; she\u2019s trying\nto build a house with her hus-band, but is undermined by\nher daughter, and ignored by\nthe elderly man she\u2019s trying to\nget sandstone from. From the\nfirst scene we see with Gina\n\u2013 she\u2019s dressed from head to\ntoe in running gear, lighting\nup a cigarette \u2013 we know that\nshe\u2019s a bundle of contradic-tions, contorting herself to the\ndifferent roles society gets us\nto play. Williams does a great\njob portraying the impossible\ndilemma she finds herself\nin: one that asks her to act\nfriendly, but then chastises her\nfor acting at all.\nIn the most haunting\nsegment of the film, Kristen\nStewart plays Beth, a trainee\nlawyer who has agreed to\nteach class law in the middle\nof nowhere after panicking that she wouldn\u2019t be\nemployed following gradua-tion. Her class is attended by\nlonely ranch-hand Jamie (Lily\nGladstone), who accompanies her to a diner after every\nclass, before Beth makes the\n4-hour drive back to Livingston; two individuals, united in\ntheir loneliness, but separated\nfrom each other by a distance\ntoo great to traverse, Beth\nand Jamie circle around each\nother, trying but failing to\nspeak across the gaps.\nThe separate tales in\nCertain Women weave\naround one another, creating\na narrative structure that\nappears loose, but belies an\ninternal rigor and structure.\nReichardt\u2019s gift with dialogue\nshines through; the lines\nspoken by the characters,\nunlike in many films, seem\ncompletely naturalistic, with\nReichardt expertly capturing\nthe nuances and rhythms present in the conversation.\nLike the progenitors of\nthe mumblecore movement,\nReichardt focuses on dialogue\nover visuals; but unlike\nAndrew Bujalski and Lynn\nShelton, Reichardt\u2019s work is\nnever anything less than completely focused on its subject\nMichelle Williams excells as one of the women\nat the heart of Reichardt\u2019s tale \\\\ Park Circus\nCertain\nWomen |\nPostcards\nfrom the edge\nof solitude\nC\nertain Women,\nAmerican\ndirector Kelly\nReichardt\u2019s sixth\nfilm, begins with\na shot that serves\nas a statement of intent: a\nrusting old train slowly drags\nitself across the Montana\nlandscape, framed by snowy\nmountain peaks; stoic in its\nsolitude, it chuffs and puffs\nalong the track, determined\nto reach its destination,\npiercing the early morning\nair with sharp whistles,\nannouncing its presence. It\u2019s\na fitting representation of\nReichardt\u2019s films, which centre\naround the normal day-to-day\nlives of average Americans,\nportraying their struggles,\ntheir defeats, and their small\ntriumphs with a relentless\n\\\\ By exalting\nand elevating the\nindividual human\nexperience,\nReichardt has\ncreated a film with\ngrace and deep\nhumanity \\\\\n\n"

Getting the first bus\nout of London, 15 girls from a\nmixture of all 6 teams headed\ninto Exeter tired but excited to\nsee what the night life is like\nfor other universities. Despite\nnot getting to the hotel until\nten, the squad headed back\nout an hour later.\nConveniently our night out\nwas only 5 minutes down the\nroad at Unit 1. It would be a\nlie to say that the discovery of\n\u00a34 doubles and the ability to\nget a drink without queuing\nfor over half an hour wasn\u2019t\nsignificant for a group of girls\nwho spend their nights out\nin one of the most expensive\ncities in the world. It was also\ninteresting to see how the\nlocal students reacted to a\nbunch of city girls. Our social\nsec Sophia managed to\namass a group of locals who\nspent the evening cheering\non her dance moves which\nwas both confusing and\namazing in equal measure.\nDon\u2019t let anyone say that\nICUNC dance moves are not\nimpressive.\nOur two netball matches\nstarted very early the next\nday, with everyone dragging themselves and their\nhangovers out by nine the\nnext day ready to play some\nmatches. The first match\nwas played by a mixture\nof players from the 3rd\n,4th\nand 5th\nteams and they did\nwell to adapt to playing in\ncombinations and positions\nthat were new to them. The\ngirls in defence did really\nwell to keep up with a very\nfast attacking side and got in\nsome great marking practice\nahead of Varsity. Siu\u2019s performance in mid court was\nespecially impressive considering the fact that she played\nin both games. The second\nteam was composed of five 1s\nteam players, Zoe from the 2s\nand our club captain Minnie.\nMinnie\u2019s team mates on the 3s\nwere especially vocal about\nMinnie\u2019s performance on the\ncourt which included some\ngreat shots from the outer\ncircle. Kath took charge of\nthe team\u2019s defensive strategy\nof the game, switching effectively with Annie and getting\nsome great tips in. Despite\nplaying 32 minute matches at\nfull effort, our teams were outplayed by a more skilled and\nthe whole was a slightly messier night than Friday without\nthe promise of more netball\nto be played the next day\nand the majority of the team\nstayed until the place closed.\nSpecial shout-out goes to\nfresher Olivia who crashed at\nSpoons at 10 before making\na strong comeback at Timepiece later on in the evening.\nReal MVP of the trip. Also\nthanks go to Exeter University\nNetball club for playing a\nmatch on a Saturday and\nshowing us all the best night\nlife in the city.\nThere\u2019s a lot coming up\nfor ICUNC before the end\nof term this year. Firstly, the\n1s team are the showcase\nmatch at Varsity this weekend\nat 3:30 in front of what\nis normally a particularly\nanimated crowd. Then next\nweekend is the annual netball\nfunday starting at 1 on 11th\nof Saturday. The event is a\nmini tournament between any\ngroup of friends who think\nthey\u2019re up to playing with us\nseasoned netballers. Mixed\nteams are also allowed, so\nboys who always say they\u2019d\nbe great at netball, time to\nput your money where your\nmouth is!\n\\\\ Despite playing\n32 minute matches\nat full effort, our\nteams were outplayed by a more\nskilled and less\nhungover home\nsquad \\\\\nless hungover home squad.\nFinal scores 30-7 and 43-18.\nAfter the matches, lack of\nsleep and intense hunger\nkicked in so the whole team\nheaded to a local restaurant\nto eat our weight in carbs,\nalthough Zoe\u2019s total failure\nto finish off her mountain of\nnachos was definitely the\nmost disappointing event\nof the weekend. After a\nrestorative nap, ICUNC\nheaded back out to meet the\nExeter netball team at the\nlocal Wetherspoons to pre\ndrink. That\u2019s right, Exeter is\nso cheap you can pre drink\nat a bar. Exeter netball team\nhelped to decided where to\nhead out on a Saturday night,\nwhich for our group ended up\nbeing a club called Timepiece\nin the city centre.

Over-eating is\nnow also considered a major\ndriver behind waste.\nUsing the data collected by\nthe United Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organisation, the\nresearchers examined ten key\nstages involved in the global\nfood system that included\ngrowing and harvesting of\ncrops and food consumption,\nusing the data to quantify the\ntotal waste that occurs.\nIt was found that around\n10% of the food produced\nglobally is lost to overeating and over 9% lands up\nin the dumpsters. This is the\nfirst study that acknowledges overeating as a way\nof wasting food. There are\nstudies that report that an\naverage person from the\ndeveloping world consumes\n20 % -30 % more calories\nthan their daily requirement.\nThis is termed as a waste as\neven though the food is being\neaten, the person eating\nit does not benefit from its\nconsumption. Especially as it\nleads to problems like obesity\nand increased risk of heart\ndiseases.\nAccording to the United\nNations Food and Agriculture\nOrganisation, over 870 million people around the world\nsuffer from malnourishment.\nWhile on one hand people\nare trying to find solutions to\neradicate hunger and find\nways to ensure global food\nsecurity for the future, most\nof the food that is produced\nlands up in the dumpster. It\nhas been estimated that an\naverage household in the UK\nthrows away as much as sixty\npounds worth of food each\nmonth. Also, North America\u2019s\nand Europe\u2019s combined disposal amounts to nearly 2.1\nbillion tonnes of food, a quantity that is equivalent to the\nannual crop produced in the\nentire sub-Saharan region.\nOur dependency on\nlivestock for meat and dairy\n\\\\ In addition to the\nfood that is thrown\naway or left to spoil,\nover-eating in now\nalso considered a\nmajor driver behind\nwaste \\\\\nand meat consumption were\ntwo leading causes behind\nfood wastage.\nAccording to the research-ers, \u201cwe are growing more\nfood than required for nutritional needs\u201d. For example,\na study (but not from the\nsame group) noted that an\naverage person from the\nproducts is another major\ndriver contributing to 40%\nof the food that is lost. 1.08\nbillion tonnes of the crops that\nare grown and harvested are\nused up to produce only 240\nmillion tonnes of animal prod-ucts, such as meat, dairy and\npoultry. The quantity of grain\nthat is grown to feed livestock\nin the US can alone feed over\n800 million people. Therefore, the growing demand\nfor meat and other animal\nproducts not only decreases\nthe efficiency of the food\nsystem but also increases the\ngreenhouse gas emissions,\ndepletes water consumption,\nand also results in great\nlosses to biodiversity.\nThe global human population is expected to rise by\n50% by 2050. This translates\nto more mouths to feed\nand less land to grow our\ncrops. Findings of this study\nraise concerns and point\nout challenges on how the\nworld population can be\nprovided with a sustainable\nand secure supply of good\nquality food. Most of the food\nthat is wasted comprises of\nvegetables, fruit and cereals\nand up to 80% can be\nsalvaged by better management and storage practices.\nAlso, rethinking our dietary\npatterns and restricting our\nfood consumption to our nutritional needs, which includes\nreducing our dependence\non animal products, will to a\nlarge extent help reverse this\ntrend, the scientists believe.\n\\\\ Most of the\nfood that is wasted\ncomprises of\nvegetables, fruit\nand cereals and\nup to 80% can be\nsalvaged by better\nmanagement and\nstorage practices \\\\\n\\\\ Anthony Albright\nit to distract from depression,\nlet lie fallow when we are\ntoo tired to think about it (for\nsome people).
