Coffee was introduced to Britain in the mid 17th century and became the fashionable drink. Many coffee shops were the\noffshoots of taverns (sound familiar?). They sprang up all over London and sold beer and wine too.\nThe Coffee Shop was set back from the road, with a garden at the front. This was built upon and after various incarnations and expansions the whole site was redeveloped in the 1920\u2019s. What we have today is three\ndistinct bar areas behind a \u2018Tudor\u2019 fa\u00e7ade.\nThe front bar is panelled, dark and comfortable. The cellar bar forms the brick foundations of a much\nolder building. The bar to the rear is both fascinating and unique. In a great church-like hall, under a high\npitched roof, a long bar counter sits below large oak vats. These are dwarfed by massive wine vats near the\nentrance, said to hold 1000 gallons each.\nOn the opposite wall is a series of small cubicles, like confessionals, where it\u2019s easy to imagine lawyers in\nconfidential conversation with their clients. Another unique feature is an ingenious triangular stove (c.1815)\nwhich stands in the centre of the bar. It has no visible chimney, the smoke is ducted away below the floor.\nSome of the fabric of the pub is older than its rebuild date and it\u2019s thought that much of it was recycled\nfrom its predecessor. It is certainly one of London\u2019s most extraordinary and unique pubs.\nCoal Hole\n91 Strand, London, WC2R 0DW\nTube: Charing Cross\nThe Coal Hole occupies a corner of the Savoy Building, designed by Thomas Collcutt. The theme of stone,\ndark wood and leaded light windows, carries on into the street level bar. The ceiling is very high with heavy\nblack beams. Hanging banners suggest something medieval, but no, it was decorated in 1904. Under the mock\nbeams is a beautiful marble frieze of wistful maidens picking vines.\nBeside the bar, in a corner, is a magnificent fireplace, heavily decorated with reliefs of vines. New lighting\nhas brought to life the pubs wonderful features. The gallery, converted from an office, is a good vantage point\nfrom which to view the friezes. The rare art nouveau d\u00e9cor was a brief interlude between the brashness of the\nlate Victorian gin palaces and mega-pubs, and a new sentimental movement which was to favour the fake \u201cye\nolde inn\u201d, harking back to more wholesome times.\nThe cellar bar is open in the evenings and has its own entrance in the Strand. It was in the basement of the\npub\u2019s former incarnation that the Wolf Club was founded, by actor and lush Edmund Kean. Supposedly a\nplace where hen-pecked husbands could enjoy a sing-song, its real role was less innocent, and involved heavy\ndrinking and loose women.\nYe Olde Cheshire Cheese\n145 Fleet St., City of London, EC4A 2BU\nTube: Blackfriars\nThis is one of the few pubs in London that can justify the \u2018Ye Olde\u2019 in its name, well known in the 17th century and rebuilt after the\nGreat Fire of 1666. Its earliest incarnations hark back to a 13th century Carmelite Monastery \u2013 the pub\u2019s cellars are thought to belong\nto that same building.\nThe experience begins before you even get to the pub, as you approach through a narrow alleyway. By the entrance, a board lists\nthe reigns of the 15 monarchs through which this grand old pub has survived. The dark wooden interior is an enchanting warren of\nnarrow corridors and staircases, leading to numerous bars and dining rooms, so many that even regulars get confused.\nA portrait of one of the Cheese\u2019s most famous patrons, Dr. Samuel Johnson (who wrote the first dictionary) hangs on a far wall, and\nhis chair set upon a shelf. A copy of Johnson\u2019s dictionary should be nearby, and his house is just around the corner.\nIn the main stairwell, increasingly narrow steps lead up to a couple of atmospheric dining rooms and private quarters. Unfortunately\nthese rooms are often closed, a shame as augment the eccentric and rambling nature of this grand old building.\nNegotiating the narrow and awkward steps down to the cellar bars is rewarded with the discovery of the vaults, a fascinating series of\ntiny, honey coloured stone rooms. These vaults were part of the original guesthouse\u2019s chapel. The steps continue into the cellar proper,\nwhere a further bar and dining area can be found.\nVolumes of visitors\u2019 books were kept and signatories include ambassadors, Prime Ministers and royalty. Unfortunately these records\nbegan after the likes of Dr. Johnson, James Boswell, Voltaire, Thackeray and of course Charles Dickens (originally a Fleet St. journalist)\ndrank here. One famous resident was a parrot whose mimicry entertained customers for 40 years; its death was announced on the\nBBC and obituaries appeared in newspapers all over the world.\nEach generation that passes through the Cheese adds to its rich history.\nOld Bank of England\n194 Fleet Street, Holborn, London, EC4A 2LT\nTube: Chancery Lane\nIt may be a bit of a cheek to include this as a traditional pub, because it has only\nbeen one since 1995. This impressive Grade I listed building was erected in 1888 as\nthe Law Courts Branch of the Bank of England and designed in the Italianate style,\nwhich was popular at the time. Ironically, an historic pub, the Cock, was moved\nacross Fleet Street to make way for the new bank.\nThe interior is solid and sturdy, just what you\u2019d expect of a bank. Fuller\u2019s Brewery has spent a small fortune restoring and decorating this fine building, and has\ncommissioned new paintings and murals. Large columns rise up to the high ornate\nplaster ceiling. From this hangs three very large brass chandeliers.\nThe central bar structure almost reaches the ceiling and is so tall, a ladder has\nbeen provided to reach the top shelf. Gold and black curtains frame the huge windows and paint effect decorate the walls. The overall feel is rich and opulent. For a\ngood view there is a gallery with limited seating. This is a very popular pub and is\noften packed at lunchtimes and early evenings.\nBar food is available and there is a restaurant through the door marked \u2018Club\nRoom\u2019.\nThe Dove\n19 Upper Mall, Hammersmith, London, W6 9TA\nTube: Hammersmith\nThis pretty little 17th Century riverside pub has everything; unspoilt surroundings, good food and excellent beer, which must explain why it gets so busy. The Dove's popularity is nothing new. It boasts a\nlong list of celebrity customers including Graham Greene, Ernest Hemingway and A.P. Herbert, whose\nnovel The Water Gypsies features a pub called the 'Pigeon', nee the Dove.\nWilliam Morris lived next door. James Thomson, who wrote Rule Britannia, lodged and is said to\nhave died here. Less certain is the claim that Charles II and Nell Gwynne had secret rendezvous here.\nAnother claim to fame is in the Guinness Book Of Records for the smallest bar in Britain, a cosy 4 ft.\n2ins by 7ft. 10ins.(1.27m x 2.39m).\nThe saloon bar has a low ceiling with dark oak beams and is simply furnished. An open fire takes off\nthe chill in winter. A small flight of steps leads to the dining area at the rear, which has ample seating.\nDouble doors lead out into a conservatory which houses an old vine. The riverside terrace beyond is a\nfavourite viewpoint for the University Boat race.\nInformation provided by:\nwww.pubs.com\n\n"

The week certainly\nhad a lot to offer the students: on Saturday night, Nick Grimshaw from\nRadio 1 was entertaining the crowds\nin the marquee, whilst on Sunday the\nfreshers were given a chance to have a\nbreak and relax with some ice cream\nand chill-out music.\nMonday was the turn of Imperial\u2019s\nBig Jazz Band, again on the stage in\nthe marquee, whilst the crowd relaxed\naround tables enjoying a fine selection\nof cheeses and wine. Tuesday was the\nFreshers\u2019 Fair with the After party in\nthe evening. The purpose of this night\nwas to allow various clubs and societies to showcase their talents, which\ncertainly worked; given the number of\npeople present and the fact that nearly\n\u00a37,000 was taken behind the bar.\nWednesday was the big night for\nall the sports teams, though the night\ndidn\u2019t go exactly to plan. The Athletics Club Committee [ACC] had been\ninformed by the Union that the night\nwould start at 6.30 p.m, which meant\nthat when they arrived earlier than expected they were refused entry. This\nled to many people leaving the Union\nand not returning, according to some\nof the club captains. To add to the\ntroubles of the night, the \u00a31.50 a pint,\nas advertised by The Union, failed to\nmaterialise until just before 9 p.m.\nEventually all the problems were fixed,\nand the crowds were entertained with\nteam karaoke and give aways, whilst\nbeing serenaded by Me & Mr Jones i.e.\nSophie Ellis-Bextor & Richard Jones\nfrom the feeling.\nThursday night was a cocktail and\nchill-out night at the union, a calm and\nrelaxing night, leading up to the Freshers\u2019 Ball on Friday. Pritchard vs Dainton, MTV\u2019s Dirty Sanchez & Wrecked\namused the crowds with their wacky\nform of entertainment, which included\nattaching fishing hooks to each other\u2019s\nears and then pulling them until one\nwas loose, as well as piercing each other with needles and then adding lemon\njuice.\nEven though the line-up looked\npromising and the fact that two of the\nbig nights were a sell-out, the question\nthat remains is wether or not the nights\nwere enjoyable for the students. Earlier\nthis week, felix decided to take a survey of 116 people, to ascertain wether\nor not the week was a success.\nThe results of the survey showed\nthat there was a fairly even split between those students who enjoyed\nthe week and those who didn\u2019t, with a\nslight majority in favour of the week.\nThis could be explained by the fact that\nroughly half of the first year students\nare actually able to attend the events,\nowing to the fact that the venues at the\nUnion have a capacity of 1,200, whilst\nthe total number of first year students\nis close to 3,000.\nWhen they were asked about the\ncost of the tickets, it was found that\nin general the cost of the tickets were\nfine, except for The Freshers\u2019 Ball,\nwhere around 70% of the people asked\nthought the tickets were too expensive\nat up to \u00a314.50.\nHowever, despite the cost, around\n60% of the students felt that Friday\nnight was the best night for them.\nCombined with the whopping 83% of\nstudents that said it were the people\nand not the entertainments that made\ntheir night, and the fact that 60% of\nthem didn\u2019t have a favourite headline\nact indicates that as long as there is\ngood music during Freshers\u2019 Week, the\nstudents will have a good time.\nAn argument can be made that it is\nbecause of the acts that the nights were\na sell-out and a huge success, however\none first year student from Southwell\nHalls commented that: \u201cI didn\u2019t really\ncare about the acts, it\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Week,\nI would have gone anyway.\u201d\nAs well as the questionnaire, felix\nasked for an comments the students\nmay have had, and it was found that\nthe majority would have preferred a\nlive band instead of a live act, since it\nwould not have involved them being\nable to see everything. This was the\nmain problem that students voiced\nThe general consensus of the Fresher\npopulation at Imperial College suggests Freshers\u2019 Week was an immense\nsuccess. In comparison to last year,\nstudents have commented on the\nnew generation of scholars as being\n\u201ctame, but more social.\u201d A view widely agreed upon, with logical reasons\nsuch as less vomit in the bathrooms,\nand more people attending sell out\nevents.\nThe high standards achieved this\nyear, kicked off with The Mingle. An\nevent that sold out before Freshers\u2019\neven turned up to their respective\nhalls. With the only tickets available\nfor sale being supplied via halls. Even\nthis, if Beit Hall was any indication,\nwas an adventurous task, with the\ntickets selling out within a few hours.\nICU\u2019s first sell out event of the week.\nAs expected, new students gathered\nen masse, with the all-too-familiar\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m BLANK\u201d and \u201cWhat A-Levels did you take/Subject to you do?\u201d\nObviously to unseasoned players of\nthe university game, this is one of the\nvery few talking points with which\none can start a converation. Respectively The Mingle was a somewhat\nconserved affair, with very merry\nspirits amongst the crowd. Alcohol\nwas consumed and surprisingly contained within the stomachs of most\nFreshers. With commendable DJ sets\nthroughout the night supplying fuel\nfor dancing into the late hours of the\nnight. However for many this was\nnot the end, with afterparties taking place in kitchens and common\nrooms. Obviously local off-licences\nwere ecstatic by the subtantial boost\nin revenue. This notion of afterpar-ties, and wild shenanigans continued\nthroughout the week, with ICU providing entertainment both good and\nbad. Comments from freshers residing in Beit have mentioned nights\nsuch as the Ice cream Sunday and\nFreshers Fair after party being particular poor for new students. This is\nmost likely attributed to Hall events\nsuperceding said Union occasions.\nWith so many unaccustomed faces\nduring these apprehensive times,\nFreshers who attended their hall festivities thoroughly enjoyed meeting\ntheir peers. With a noticed increase in\nalcohol consumption, defensive walls\nprotecting people\u2019s true personalities\ncrumbled. More friends were made,\ncorridors got to know one another\nand the expected Fresher cliques\nwere formed. Continuing throughout\nthe week, amusing stories from the\nlast night were relived, providing better talking points than the aformen-tioned greetings. Argubly the least\nsuccessful night was Wednesday,\nwith many freshers choosing to go to\nFabric and see Dizzy Rascal instead\nof the cat like Sophie Ellis-Bextor and\nother half Richard Jones. Thursday\nICU wisely decided to take a break,\nas Fabric hosted yet abother crazy\nnights of tunes. This didn\u2019t mean,\nhowever, Freshers\u2019 not going to the\nmighty Fabric missed out. Many student halls seized the moment to provide more exciting trips to the outside\nworld. A few of these just ended up in\ncomplete carnage, with some Freshers\u2019 blood alcohol content reaching\nfatal limits.\nThe question \u201cWhat could make\nthis week better\u201d crossed the minds of\nseverely malnourished Freshers\u2019. The\nanswer was Friday\u2019s Fresher\u2019s Ball.\nAnother sell out event, and according\nto a recent felix survey, the most enjoyable night for numerous Freshers.\nThis night contained massive lineups\nform artists such as Nicky Blackmarket, DJ Hype and Rusko. However the\nnights main highlight were the crazy\nboys from Dirty Sanchez. Perfoming\nstunts such as smashing light bulbs\non their backs, abusing their bodies\nwith sparks from an angle grinder.\nStudents felt the show was sick and\nawesome.\nOn the whole, This years Freshers\u2019 Week was both a success to the\nUnion and the Freshers\u2019. The only\nnegative comments being the high\nadmission price for the events. An\nexample being the ejoyable Freshers\u2019\nBall, robbing poor student of \u00a314.50.\nEvidently various halls saw this as being too harsh on the student pocket,\nand in some Halls the tickets were\nsubsidised to \u00a310.\nThe lovely ladies of Imperial College\nHall Seniors, showing the freshers how to drink.\nabout Friday night, as it was proving\ndifficult to see the Dirty Sanchez act\nsince the stage was too low. Concern\nwere also raised as to the capacity of\nthe venue, as a lot of the students were\nunable to attend, with several students\ncommenting that the Union should\nprobably try and find an external venue\nthat can hold all the students.\nAnother surprising result was that\nthe second favourite night was the After party on the Tuesday, with the main\ncomment being that the live music\nmade it enjoyable for them. This can\nbe viewed as a massive success for the\nvarious clubs and societies that took\npart in the show.\nIn conclusion, the survey did provide\na valuable insight into the general opinion of Freshers\u2019 Week, with the main\nfindings being that Friday night was\ntoo expensive, and that the students\nwould prefer live band rather than a\nlive act, which coincides with the comments made about Tuesday night. In\nterms of satisfaction, the consensus of\nthe survey seemed to have been that as\nlong as good music is played, the week\nwill be a success, regardless. However,\nothers have argued that the true success of Freshers\u2019 Week will be seen by\nhow many of the students will be retained by the various clubs and societies in the coming weeks.\nRavi Pall\nBeit Hall Senior\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in chief\nFreshers\u2019 gone wild: The marque full of students having a good time.\nFreshers\u2019 week 2008 was hailed as a great success by the union, with both the Mingle and the Fresher\u2019s\nBall selling out, with 1200 students attending both events. Fresher\u2019s fair attracted over 300 stalls\nPicture: Tom Roberts\nPicture: Tom Roberts\nPicture: Tom Roberts\nPicture: Tom Roberts\n\n"

What has\nwrought this shattering of the previous Imperial prototype of the socially\ndoomed geek? I have also witnessed a\nsurge in the number of people expressing a desire to review plays, inspect art\ngalleries and even try their hands at\nsome rhetoric. (Hitherto, all of them\nfemale, come on lads!) Are we in the felix office close to no longer being able\nto comfort ourselves with the fact that\nwe are the only interesting people at\nImperial?\nOur inaugural arts section this\nyear started with a very effective and\nthought provoking column by Emily\nwho asks us scientists to think about\nwho we are besides physicists, engineers or biologists and what else defines our personalities. Even if you\nrecoil at the prospect of undergoing a\ncultural mission for the benefit of felix\nArts readers, it is worth pointing out\nthat art affects and reaches us all. In\nmany of the adverts that abound as a\nresult of free economy, on television,\non the radio in the form of music and I\nam sure that all of us have seen a film at\nleast once in our lives. Therefore, if you\nhave already made up your mind never\nto write syllable for this arts section,\nyou will be sure to find something of\ninterest to you here and possibly even\nsomething which may inspire a new\npassion in you.\nFor the remainder of this column I\nconsidered elaborating on how this\ntrite financial situation is affecting\nthe art world: the artists and how we\nthe viewer consume this art. But that\nwould be conflicting with my hatred of\nall the coverage this \u201ccrisis\u201d is receiving\nand the abundance with which it is spoken about. Let us try and leave art as an\nuntainted haven as hard as that might\nbe considering how most things in this\nworld are kept on a ball and chain by\nthe economy. Turn over for Rosie Milton\u2019s cheering account of how the art\nworld is triumphing despite the rise in\ndefeated bankers.\nI also had the idea of expounding\nthe notion of how art and science are\nnot mutually exclusive as many have\ncome to believe. However, I think this\ndebate has been made redundant from\nthe frequency with which I have tried\nto convince you that they are not and\nby the fact that to anyone it should be\nso obvious that the two can be so inherently linked. Art comes about from\nscience and technology and in turn, art\nhas been a medium through which science can be explained and made more\nattractive. Members of both \u201csides\u201d can\nlearn valuable skills from dabbling in a\nforeign subject.\nT\nhe irony of staging Strindberg\u2019s Creditors during the\ncurrent financial troubles\naffecting the world will\nsurely enhance the image\nof debt collectors hanging over you\nwhile you sleep. This is certainly one of\nthe image Strindberg constructed for\nan ex-husband overshadowing a mar-riage. Strindberg does in fact go further in the examination of marriages\nin David Greig\u2019s compact, cut down\nversion of Creditors. Anxiously awaiting the return of his new wife, Adolph\ndraws comfort from the words of a\nstranger. But this turns to destruction\nas old wounds are opened, insecurities are laid bare and former debts are\nsettled. The play offers abundant insights into relationships and marriage.\nIt deals with how opinions of couples\ndiverge or converge, implications for\nfuture relationships after divorce and\ninsights which seem obvious, only becoming clear when spoken of.\nThe success of the production depends on the portrayal of the manipulation and threat by the ex-husband\nGustav as he comes back for revenge.\nAs a stranger, he sets about conversing\nA different sort of Credit Crunch\nChris Hong finds irony and welcome relief in the Donmar Warehouse\u2019s latest production of Creditors\nwith the husband, Adolf, who is suffering from a debilitating illness in a seaside resort hotel lounge. The director,\nAlan Rickman, managed to sustain the\nmomentum of threat and anticipation\nof menace. This compensated for the\ndrop in pace during some parts of the\nplay where the tension between the\ncharacters slackened. Tom Burke as\nAdolf was soulful in his confession of\nlove for his wife whilst being a man\ntortured with physical disability. Anna\nChancellor\u2019s Tekla was playful and seductive and a great illustration as to\nwhat brought on the insecurities about\nmen in her life. Owen Teale played the\nex-husband Gustav with subtle quietness which exploded gloriously into\nterror for the couple. The beautiful\nset of white wash walls and furniture\ngave an air of deliberate cover up of the\npast, adding to the cynicism and isolation conveyed by the dripping sound of\nwater which surrounds the stage. This\nbeautifully lit production is not per-fect, but during the persisting financial\nuncertainty, to be reminded of a different kind of creditors may be a welcome\ndistraction.Until 15 November\n\u201cDie, Bitch, die!\u201d Tom Burke as Adolf and Anna Chancellor as his wife, Tekla\nAnyone for\nsome Hedda?\nHenrik Ibsen\u2019s classic Hedda Gabler is\ngiven an unsuccessful modern makeover.\nChris Hong tells all\nT\nhere have been numerous\nrevivals of this Ibsen classic recently, and the last I\nmanaged to catch was at\nthe Almeida with the fantastic Eve Best who deservedly won her\nshare of awards and accolade. This new\nupdated version set in present day Notting Hill will have a lot to live up to.\nModern day amendments include a 6\nmonth trip to the Far East instead of a\ntrain journey around Europe, and what\nused to be a manuscript has now become a USB Flash drive. However, an\nattempt made for these to be blended\ninto the script stands out too much\nas deliberate acts to modernise rather\nthan add anything to the dramatics.\nSome updates work beautifully,\nlike the chic (albeit a little run-down)\napartment where the play is set, bringing a real sense of living slightly beyond their means, and the clever scene\nchange with the boys out clubbing\nenhances the image of Eli descending\ninto drugs and alcohol. The cast bring\nOwen Beale as ex-husband, Gustav, in the Domar Warehouse\u2019s production of Creditors\na real youthfulness to the play and the\nwriting and direction also succeeded\nin that.\nThere was some very commendable\nacting in Adrian Bower as the rough\nand wild Eli and Alice Patten as the timid and emotional Thea. Cara Horgan\u2019s\nspoilt, immature sixth former Hedda\ncontributes towards the understanding\nof her manipulative behaviour. However, Toby, played by Christopher Obi,\nlacks the menace in his threat to force\nthe conclusion of the play.\nOverall, the modern update, set in\nLondon in mid September, fails to convey the failing of closeness and feeling\nof being trapped felt by Hedda Gabler\nin Norway\u2019s mid-winter. Although\nthere are productions of Hedda Gablers out there which will provide more\ndrama, this is a competent attempt to\nbring something different to one of Ibsen\u2019s great works.\n21 August - 27 September 2008\nCate Blanchett as Hedda in a current New York production of Hedda\nI first watched the film Event Horizon\nwhen I was 12 years old, a watershed\nage between an indiscriminate state of\nterror when subjected to horror films\nof dubious production value, and the\nage where one learns about things like\nanimatronics and bad CGI. An age\nin which one simply ought to know\nbetter.\nMy elder brother and I would sit and\nsit through hours of torrid crap on the\ntube \u2013 enjoying most of it \u2013 and engage with all manner of material on\nSky Movies. Jason Voorhees sequels,\nB-movies, faux-indie Hollywood dross\n\u2013 we watched it all. One night, taking\nour places in front of the TV for what\nhad now become a ritual, we settled\ndown for our evening movie fix.\nI have to admit, even as a preteen oik,\nthe prospect of a bunch of astronauts\nstuck on a spaceship together for two\nhours wasn\u2019t the most enticing offer\nthe Gods that be (i.e. Rupert Murdoch)\nhad ever lavished upon me. But the\nbrightest little gems that dot the diamond canopy of pop culture are not\nalways the most obvious ones. Hours\nof intense character development\nand human drama set in a 50\u2019s prison\nsounds about as enticing as dropping\nthe soap in Wormwood Scrubs, but\nThe Shawshank Redemption is cherished by even the most obdurate of the\nwilful ignorati.\nWatching the crew of the ship disappearing and being picked off one by\none in an increasingly macabre fashion\nwas engrossing in itself. But the oppressive air of foreboding and claustrophobia the film generated was intoxi-cating, and as the crew traced their last\nsteps before being \u2018offed\u2019, you felt like\ntheir living shadow. The way it pulled\nyou through a wormhole violently into\na landscape of pitiless terror without a\nripple was uncanny.\nI felt the same violent pull when I\nattended the opening of Tate Britain\u2019s\nFrancis Bacon retrospective the other\nday. The stillness of the gallery was a\nbody of water that belied a Godless\nviolence and brutality that was visible\nto anyone who cared to slip beneath its\nexterior. PRs clacked around in cumbersome heels and journalists pointed\nand squinted. In another room, the exhibition curator took questions loudly.\nAn usher yawned, glad for a change of\nscenery, yet mindful that he would be\nstuck in a room of hellish canvases for\nthe next few months. But even stuck\nin the mundanity of the everyday, the\nwork still speaks for itself, and as with\nthe best of any art, succeeds in engrossing and provoking the viewer in\nequal measure.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. Francis\nbloody Bacon. A key protagonist in the\nMarmite minefield that is contemporary art. You love him, or you despise\nhis work. Years later and a new generation of young artists do not appreciate\nthe fuss, and another generation of\nsecondary school art teachers lament\nyet another screaming figure, face\ndistorted and/or agonised, that could\nhave been copied wholesale from the\nartist\u2019s oeuvre.\nBacon is one of a breed of controversial artists that has dominated the\nlandscape of the art world for the past\ncentury. This is because controversy\ncreates great PR buzz. And you can\u2019t\nsell anything without that. Variously\ncalled indulgent, decadent, vulgar and\nscornful, Bacon\u2019s worldview was one of\nthe most interesting aspects of his life\nand was one that added immensely to\nan audience\u2019s perception of his work.\nAn atheist who made the symbolism\nof faith his own, Bacon looked at the\nworld with unflinching, unromanti-cised eyes. Humanity was only one in\na menagerie of Godless creatures, ripe\nto be locked up, scrutinised, experimented upon and torn apart with an\nunbiased hand equally versed in the\nprocedures of science and butchery.\nThe exhibition deftly takes advantage\nof this, and the first few rooms depicting snarling, contorted primates are\nfollowed by Bacon\u2019s screaming popes,\ninfluenced by Velasquez\u2019s Portrait of\nPope Innocent X.\nIf a pope isn\u2019t spared from the uncaring gaze of the artist, then it thus does\nnot come as a surprise that his depiction of the crucifixion is especially\nbloody. The event is treated brutally\nand unsentimentally. Never the shrinking violet, the artist boldly states that\nChrist is little more than a bloodied\nand imperfect pile of flesh.\nDespite the exhibition\u2019s abundance\nand flair for the type of existentialist\nrage that one typically identifies Bacon\u2019s work with, unexpected treasure\narrives in the form of Bacon\u2019s portraits\nof his former lover, George Dyer, who\nunceremoniously killed himself two\ndays before a pivotal gallery opening at\nthe Grand Palais in Paris in 1971. The\narchive portraits of close friends and\nlovers are also unexpectedly tender.\nImportantly, we also learn that despite Bacon\u2019s devil-may-care attitude\nto painting and his love of spontaneity,\nhis work actually benefited from preparatory studies and drawings much\nlike any other traditional artist, loath\nas he would have been to admit it.\nThe exhibition lacks in the years up\nto Bacon\u2019s breakthrough work in 1944,\nbut this is a minor quibble to what is\nessentially a long-overdue tribute to\none of the nation\u2019s greatest (the exhibition travels to Madrid and the Met\nnext year), and for the modern art nay-sayers, he worked until his last triptych\nin 1991. The touch is deft, his understanding of colour dazzling and for all\nhis personal shortcomings, his passion\nand focus consummate.\nAtheism is so hot right now\nDavid Paw thinks Francis Bacon would clean up at Sotheby\u2019s. If he were still alive.\nWhile Jimbob wrote his paper on the sex life of a golf ball, grandpappy relieved himself upstairs\n\n"

Another\nweek, another\nchance to enter the\nphotoshop compe-tition. Remember, you could win an\niPod. A real one. I promise it\u2019ll even be\nnew.\nAlso, how awesome was the Freshers\u2019\nBall on Friday? That was a rhetorical\nquestion. It was immense. The Dirty\nSanchez boys both digust and amuse\nme. All that matters is that Dainton\ngave me his blood-stained T-Shirt.\nBlood + T-shirt = Awesome\nYeah, that\u2019s right. It also made me\nhappy to see the ever-so-lovely Jager\nGirls. Although I was scared by the\npodgy one who looked like it took a tub\nof lard to squeeze her into her dress.\nLike I cared though. Jagermeister is by\nfar my favourite drink. Sure it tastes\nlike cough syrup that has been left\nopen for a year, but mix that with the\ngenius of redbull and you don\u2019t even\nknow it\u2019s there.\nIn other news, the new MacBooks\nhave come out. Now I don\u2019t count myself as a hardcore apple fan boy, but\ndamn do they look sweet. Somebody\nhook me up with one, I\u2019m poor. I know\nsome of you will say \u2018tough, I don\u2019t get\none for free either.\u2019 However, have you\npeople thought about the fact that I\nlook like a pirate? No, thought not.\nThat is all.\nAlso lectures started this week, probably earlier for some of you. I have three\nrecommendations. The first is to bring\nyour pillow to your lectures. Seriously;\nthose desks are hard. A Pillow makes\nthat mid day nap all the better. Second\nis avoid all 9 o\u2019clock lectures. Don\u2019t be\nthe chump everyone copies the notes\nfrom because you turned up. Be the\nguy/girl who copies of the chump that\ndid. No offense to Chumps, I\u2019m jealous\nyou\u2019re going to get a first. Lastly, Bring\na hipflask full of hard liquor. If you have\nto go you may as well be drunk.\nBack to more Coffee Break stuff,\nSikh MC didn\u2019t make it this week.\nLong story short, we in the felix office\nthought that Snaky B dressed as Dizzy\nRascal was way better. We were right.\nOur man Marc Kerstein is hooking us\nup with all sorts to give away with the\niPod- or so I heard. He better, he\u2019s the\nApple campus rep for Imperial College.\nHe\u2019ll hook you guys up with whatever\nyou need (to do with Apple. He\u2019s not a\ndrug dealer).\n4. Relentless:\nIf there is one thing Imperial College Students like, it\u2019s anything that\u2019ll\nkeep you awake during the day, during the night and during you exams.\nNow Pro Plus is the usual option, or\nRedbull. But both fail in comparison\nto Relentless. I\u2019ve seen rhinos have\nheart attacks on this stuff.\nI won\u2019t lie to you, I drink at least one\ncan a day. This stuff packs a punch,\nand at 230 Kcal per can it\u2019s hard core.\nHell, even David Cameron used it to\ntell the Labour party to \u201cWake up!\u201d\nBest thing is, unlike Redbull, it comes\nin 3 flavours. Normal, Orange, and\nJuice. All three taste exactly the same\nthough, suggesting that there is just\nway too much sugar. Reminds me\nof Powerthirst (youtube it). It even\nmakes me wonder whether it can be\nlegal.\nLike Jagermeister? Try Jager bombs\nwith relentless. If that doesn\u2019t send\nyou to the moon, I don\u2019t know what\nwill. Well, a space shuttle perhaps.\nCoffee Break\n32 felix Friday 17 October 2008\nThis weeks winner. Team Vader. Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk\nCongratulations to this week\u2019s win-ner, Team Vader. We\u2019ll be honest\nwhen we say they won only because\nof their immature, yet hilarious reiteration of the CGCU url. Also the\nwords \u201cEPIC FAIL.\u201d Just so you guys\nknow, they put Darth Vader in their\nentry last week as well. It\u2019s like some\nkind of gimmick. Also many chuckles were made at the inclusion of\nKirby. Someone is obviously a fan of\nhangman.\nDrink with me, I\u2019m Snaky B\nand this week I\u2019m dressed as DZ\nThis week\u2019s image is of Dainton and\nPritchard from Drity Sanchez.

What up my breth-ren? I\u2019ve got to chat\nto you, I\u2019ve got something to tell all you\npussy\u2019oles.\nYou\u2019ve got fix up, there\u2019s a lot of nasty\nbros walking around and you know it\u2019s\ntime they try and look sharp. It ain\u2019t\nabout getting attention, mate being\na celebrity don\u2019t mean shit to me, it\u2019s\nall about self-respect. It\u2019s about getting your backs up, backs up, back off\nthe wall and making sure you stand up\ntall.\nYou\u2019ll never know if you just walk\npast, you better just ask. That\u2019s some\nwisdom man. Remember it. You got to\ntake it further than the dance floor. Ya\nunderstand my man? If you need some\nfun, just glance at me and we\u2019ll party\ncool? We\u2019ll kick it old school! You get\nme? Blud you\u2019re not wrong if you think\nI want to get involved..\nAnyway enough of the guys. I want\nto let all the ladies know that I want to\nget behind your backbone. Snaky B,\nI\u2019m good to go blud, because they don\u2019t\nknow I\u2019m keepin it gansta. Who\u2019d up in\nthe end flow, keepin it tight?\nkthnxbye!\nMore sugar than you need. Yes!\nIf anything in this or its associate\nsections offend you in any way,\nplease bear in mind I\u2019m not\nresponsible for the Hangman\nteam. Those guys are crazy and\nas a result don\u2019t blame me.\nVirgo\nThis week you\u2019ll\nmeet Aaron Berk,\na second year. He\ncan\u2019t speak to you\nthough. Tragically\nhe was deer shanked\nin the ass, had his member filed away by a\ncheese grater and sentenced to euthanasia\nthe old-fashioned way. Thats right, being\ntorn apart by 4 rampantly horny horses is\ncool again. I would like to thank Aaron for his\neffort to bring me back.\nScorpio\nThis week Felix is\nreally depressed.\nThere is so much\nstupid, inane crap\nbeing thrown\naround and I really\njust want to smile. I don\u2019t even have the\nenthusiasm or life-in-me to go to Cheapskates\nwith a school friend. Do you see what you\u2019ve\nfucking done? I hate you all, I really really hate\nyou.\nLibra\nThis week you find\nyourself a familar\nplace, a lecture\ntheatre. Wow this is\nboring, how can you\nmake it interesting?\nI would suggest, as a man of the cloth, that you\ntake a piece of rope, wrap it around the neck\nof the person next to you and scream \u201cDIE\nBITCH\u201d until they tell you WHAT THE FUCK\nTHE LECTURER IS TALKING ABOUT\nSagittarius\nThis week you left\nyour blue shirt at a\nfriend\u2019s house. They\nwere kind enough\nto wash it, dry it,\niron it and fold it;\npresenting it to you with a pillow on top. However you find out that they used slave child\nlabour and the blood of a thousand puppys as\ndetergent. You have a new found respect for\nyour buddy and you buy him a cake in thanks,\nunethical dead baby cake of course.\nCapricorn\nThis week you\nexperiment in bed.\nYour undeservedly\nbetter half begins\nto tie you up. Once\nbound and gagged\nshe begins to pour hot wax over you, laughing\nas you scream in pain. God won\u2019t help you, he\ndoesn\u2019t believe in sex before marriage. Why do\nyou think all women are married to god at the\nsame time as their husband?\nCancer\nThis week you\nwent to Fabric\nfor the very first\ntime in your life. It\nwas a memorable\nexperience\nbut something was lacking, something\nvery important. Oh yes, I wasn\u2019t wearing\nunderwear. As my groin sweat rubbed onto\nmy tight skinny jeans I felt the comforting\nsensation of an older man groping my testicles.\nGemini\nThis week a student\ncomplains about the\nHangman section.\nUnfortunately, he\nchooses to come\ninto the office at an\ninopportune moment, when the Editors just\nhappen to be polishing their deer shivs. His\nobituary reads \u201cThat damn bitch got what\nhe fucking deserved. Love Mum\u201d. Few people\nattend his funeral, even fewer people wank on\nhis grave. Well just one person. Me.\nLeo\nThis week you\nrealise that working\nbehind the bar in\nthe Union isn\u2019t all\nthat it\u2019s cracked up\nto be. In fact there\nisn\u2019t any crack at all. You spend 6 miserable\nhours completely sober before you lose control\nand punch the next person who asks you to\ntop up their fucking pint. I swear, I will fucking\nKILL the next cunt-stain who asks,\nTaurus\nThis week you\nare a right-wing\nconservative. You\nhave abandoned all\nyour free-market\nprinciples and cling\ndesperately to the lifejacket of government\nintervention. Most of you can\u2019t even jump out\nof your office windows because you have been\nfired and security have strict orders to beat\nyou up on sight. You have failed.\nAries\nAt some point this\nweek you\u2019ll wake up\nand look at yourself\nin the mirror.\nDisgusting. You\u2019re\ntoo much of a pussy\nto top yourself off so you make yourself smile...\njoker style. Unsurprsingly your smile doesn\u2019t\nimpress the ladies (scarred freak). Looks like\nnothing\u2019s changed for you then. Well I say\nnothing, the rape you\u2019ll suffer may be a new.\nPisces\nThis week a Felix\nEditor says that\nEnoch\u2019s crosswords\nare lame. Enoch\nseizes a nearby\nsword and through\ngritted teeth exclaims \u201cIf you EVER say that\nagain, I will destroy YOU\u201d. He then returns\nto his corner in the Felix office and grumbles\nabout \u201cthose kids\u201d. The offending Felix Editor\nthen buys a bottle of whisky and does an\nexplicit parody of \u201cGirls Gone Wild\u201d. Sweet.\nHorrorscopes: get ready to be fucked over... HARD\nAquarius\nThis week it\u2019s\ncertain that you\u2019ll\nhave sex. Probably\nfor the first time.\nDefinitely with that\ngirl you met while in\nhospital. You know the one paralysed from the\neyeballs down, blind, deaf, dumb. Oh yeah jizz\ninto those bedsores. Do it. It could be worse,\nshe could have AIDS as well. Save that girl for\nnext week. Buckaroo anyone?\nSlitherlink 1,411\n07980 148 785\nThis week\u2019s texts:\n\u201cPlease feed the cat. I don\u2019t want\nfelix it to go to kitty hell.\n\u201d\n\u201cLectures would be so much more\nappealing if I were naked more\noften\u201d\n1 3\n3\n2\n3\n2\n2\n3\n2 3\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n1 0\n3\n1\n3 2\n3\n2\n2\n1 2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n3\n1\n1\nBack by popular demand. The sick bastard from the first issue. You asked for it.\nDear Tamara,\nI\u2019m a fresher, staying in halls, and although I came to university in a loving\nand committed relationship, my other\nhalf is hundreds of miles away and I\nkeep having slightly drunken hanky-panky with a girl in halls. I feel really\nbad afterwards, but at the time my\nbrain isn\u2019t the one doing the thinking.\nWhat should I do?\nFrustrated Fresher,\nCold shower in Princes Gardens\nDear Frustrated Fresher,\nIn these situations, I like to adopt the\nwhat-he/she-doesn\u2019t-know-can\u2019t-hurthim/her attitude. Realistically, she\u2019s\nprobably doing the same thing anyway,\nno matter how soppy her emails are. In\nfact the soppier the guilt-ier as far as\nI\u2019m concerned!\nTry to look on the bright side; at\nleast you got an Imperial girl to look\nat you, imagine how the guys with\nno girls are feeling! My advice to you\nis to keep both on the go. Eventually\ntimetable clashes may arise, and some\nplate-throwing rows may be inevitable,\nbut you can worry about that when the\ntime comes.\nDear Tamara,\nI don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going on, last\nweek I woke up in a basement in Beit\n\u2013 I don\u2019t even live in Beit! Thankfully I\nstill had my trousers, but was missing\nmy shirt, glasses and shoes. The place\nwas a complete tip, like someone had\njust turned it upside down. After finding my possessions in various places\naround the union, I carried on as nor-mal. However, I keep finding strangers\ntalking to me like they know me and we\nshared some hilarious experience, or\nsome people just laugh as I pass them\nin the corridor.\nAll I really remember of the night before is the guys buying me drinks! I\u2019m so\nconfused, what\u2019s going on?\nConfused, In the dark\nDear Confused,\nI can really sympathise with your situ-ation. To me the success of a night out\nis measured by the number of free\ndrinks I have received from potential\nsugar daddies. The best thing to do is\nto adopt a nonchalant attitude and pretend like you know exactly what happened that night, you\u2019re just too cool to\ncare. People will see that you don\u2019t care\nand will copy you. Of course, for this\nto work, you must be cool enough for\npeople to want to copy you\u2026\nDear Tamara,\nI really want to have sex with my boyfriend but I am afraid he\u2019ll think I look\nhorrible naked because I\u2019m really thin\nwith tiny boobs. What should I do?\nStick Insect\nDear Stick Insect,\nThe man should (and will) be grateful\nthat you\u2019re agreeing to sleep with him\nin the first place. He\u2019ll be far too desperate to get your clothes off to really\nnotice what\u2019s underneath. If you were a\nbit of a chubster, you would worry that\nthe man will think you are too wobbly.\nSo just chill out and look at him critically instead \u2013 he is the one who should\nworry about pleasing you. Alternatively, use your loan to get some help of the\nsilicone variety. It\u2019s like the underwear\ndilemma - girls worry about what they\nwear but if you ask most men, underwear is just a hindrance to their pursuit\nof what is underneath.\nTamara says: \u201cKill two birds with one cock!\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk/sections/coffee_break for intructions.\nThis week I\u2019m loving scooters!\nGot a problem, contact Tamara at\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFriday 17 October 2008 felix\n\n"

Nearly four\nmonths of partying, doss-ing, drunken nights, days\nat work, travelling, days of\njust chilling out in the sun with your\nfavourite beverage clutched in your\nhands and the radio/music on full\nblast, the list goes on. Now it\u2019s time for\na new term, new faces, the same old\nroutines returning with a loud HELLO\nand last but not least, time to check out\nnew bands and new music. Well, that is\nwhat I am here for, so if you have any\nqueries or thoughts about Music felix,\nfeel free to email us (meaning the team,\ncomprisingofme,PeterandJames,who\nis a new addition to the felix team) and\nwe\u2019ll try to get them answered a.s.a.p.\nprovided that it\u2019s something relevant\nas we are busybodies with a lot on our\nhands... Much appreciated.\nThis summer, I ventured out to the V\nFestival in Weston Park, Staffordshire,\nwhich is incidentally an hours drive\nfrom where I live, so I guess it was only\na small trek down the road. The lineup for this massive shebang was definitely something. I was enlightened by\ncountless big guns like Muse, Stereophonics, The Verve and Kings of Leon,\njust to name a few. Other headliners\nincluded the Kaiser Chiefs, The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. There\nwere also gazillions of smaller names\nsuch as Girls Aloud, Newton Faulkner,\nScouting for Girls, The Feeling, Amy\nWinehouse (who actually turned up,\nsurprise, shock, horror, not only this,\nshe wasn\u2019t entirely pissed off her face\nor drugged up, if her demeanour and\nperformance were anything to go by,\nbut still did not perform half as well as\nshe is capable of, what a waste of talent\nI say), and Duffy that were part of the\ngolden bill. This eclectic line-up ensured a well mixed crowd, something\nthat appeased pretty much everyone.\nThere may have been somewhat less\nsunshine and a little more rain than we\nhoped for, but the action was DAMN\ngood. Nothing could have clouded the\nfestival mood, not the flooding toi-lets, not the nonexistent showers, not\nthe muddy, slippery ground that leapt\ninvitingly at your legs, urging you to\ndive into the chocolatey ocean. Some\npeople, of their own accord of course,\nstripped half naked and dived in hap-pily, rolling in the mud, soaking in the\nfestival cheer and having a ball. What\na wonderful, hilarious sight. I have to\nadmit, I did give it a pass, being the\ncleanliness freak that I am, but maybe\nnext time I\u2019ll give it a shot, if the showers turn up. Well, that is my festival\nstory told.\nThis week I\u2019ve got an interview with\nFrightened Rabbit, a band that has only\nbeen on the circuit for a few years and\na cracking album by Vessels that could\ndo with a browse. Au revoir, ciao, adi-os, auf wiedersehen, zai jian, annyong-hi kashipshio, sayonara, pirmelenge,\nbye... whatever floats your boat...\nWe get mountains of CDs sent\nto us every week and there are\nalways gigs that need going\nto and reviewing. If you fancy\ngetting some free stuff give us an\nemail at music.felix@gmail.com\nVessels are a quintet, five lovely guys\nfrom up North, Leeds lads they are\nindeed. Having performed countless\nincendiary live sets throughout the\nlength and breadth of the country,\nthese guys released their debut album\nin August. They have received a fantastic response, including rave reviews:\nKerrang \u2013 \u2018Awe-inspiring\u2026 This is a\nglorious, beautiful, unique, moving\nand magnificent album, 4/5,\u2019 NME \u2013 \u2018a\nquite brilliant work of art\u2019 and the seal\nof approval from BBC Introducing\u2019s\nHuw Stephens. Their music is thought\nto have been shaped by a bit of eve-rything, from electronic post rock to\nindie, finally ending up with their own\ncohesive yet distinctive sound. There\nare undoubtedly many post rock bands\nin the music industry that are essentially copycats of Mogwai or Explosions In The Sky, but frankly Vessels\ndo not fall under this category. Thank\ngoodness.\nThe sound of Vessels is colossal in\nevery sense. From the mixture of su-perb, distorted and sometimes delayed\nsynthesised guitar sounds and irrefu-tably awesome double drumming to\nthe beautifully simple piano arpeggios,\nintricate glitch patterns, spellbinding\nguitar riffs, it\u2019s all delivered with im-agination, flair and passion.\nThis strangely wonderful, nebulous\naffair of an album storms away with\n\u2018Altered Beast\u2019, a timeless hypnotic\nconcoction of loopy guitar riffs, complex bass, synthesised instrumentation\nand excellent drumming that has immense drive and holds the whole thing\ntogether immaculately.

The band is comprised\nof the lovely brothers Scott\nand Grant Hutchison, as well as Billy\nKennedy and Andy Monaghan, who\njoined the crew later on down the line.\nMusic Felix went and had a good old\nbanter with the front man vocalist /\nguitarist Scott...\nWhat does the name Frightened\nRabbit encompass?\nIt relates to my own social foibles, a\nlook I had as a youngster when faced\nwith encounters with more confident\nchildren. I then found out that a rab-bit, when frightened, has about 10\ntimes the strength of a relaxed rabbit.\nNot sure how that applies to us, I just\nthought it was interesting.\nDo the band have some kind of\nrabbit fetish?\nI have no fetishes towards animals. I\u2019d\ndefinitely like to make that clear.\nOn the topic of fetishes, does anyone have any weird and wonderful\nfetishes that they\u2019d like to enlighten us with?\nBilly likes older women, but not to the\npoint of a fetish. It is more of a hobby.\nI like picking scabs, Andy is into laser\nwar games and Grant likes drilling\nholes in chairs.\nPlease give a brief description of\nthe band and what type of music\nyou play.\nThere are four of us in the band and\nwe make very pleasant guitar pop mu-sic. We have one song with electronic\ndrums on it and a couple of songs with\nthe piano too.\nHow long have you guys been out\nthere making and doing music and\nhow did you form a band in the\nfirst place?\nAbout 3 years. We\u2019ve grown in number\nsince I played on my own with a guitar,\nadding one member each year.\nHow did you get signed?\nWe were approached by FatCat very\nearly on, and nothing really happened.\nAfter 2 years of near misses with other\nlabels FatCat finally came back and offered to sign us. We were very lucky\nindeed.\nWhen you were young, what kind\nof music did you listen to?\nWhen I was very young I would listen\nto Vanilla Ice or Wet Wet Wet. Later,\nI became a big fan of The Stone Roses,\nPearl Jam and Soundgarden.\nWhat kind of childhood have you\nhad? Do you ever regret anything\nyou\u2019ve done in your childhood?\nI regret being so obedient. You can get\naway with a lot as a child and I didn\u2019t\ntake full advantage of that.\nDo you remember any moments\nfrom your teenage years with rel-ish? Were any of you wild childs?\nI wasn\u2019t terribly wild. Like I said, I\ndidn\u2019t take full advantage of what the\nworld had to offer. I think I\u2019m better at\nthat now though.\nDo you think the way people have\nbeen brought up has a major influence on how their music is shaped?\nIf so, in what kind of ways?\nAbsolutely. Our parents like folk mu-sic, and artists such as Kate Bush and\nQueen and I think it has found its way\ninto the sound of our band now. Ok,\nmaybe not so much with Queen...\nWho is the most arrogant one\nin the band? Who is the ladies\u2019\nman?\nI\u2019m easily the most arrogant. But that\u2019s\nbecause I\u2019m the best. Three of us have\ngirlfriends which, in a strange way,\nmakes us very good ladies\u2019 men.\nWhat about the most cheeky one?\nBilly has a wide variety of shit jokes.\nDoes anyone in the band have bad\nhabits?\nEvery one of us. Bad habits are the\nmost enjoyable ones.\nAre any of you political?\nI usually vote, but it\u2019s not based on a\ngreat deal of knowledge. I don\u2019t absorb\nit all that well.\nAre you inclined in favour of Labour, Conservative or Lib Dem?\nErrr... isn\u2019t that private. Honestly\nthough, I don\u2019t really care that much.\nDo you think musicians have\nmuch say in the way society is\nshaped?\nThey have done, and a good song can\ncertainly soundtrack a movement.\nI don\u2019t think that music alone can\nchange the world, it can only make it a\nbit easier to be alive.\nName the 3 worst bands in\nhistory.\nThe Twilight Sad, We Were Promised\nJetpacks, Ross Clark and The Scarfs\nGo Missing.\nDo you prefer playing in a smaller\nmore intimate gig or to a bigger\ncrowd?\nBoth have their plus points. I feel it is\neasier to get away with mistakes at the\nbigger shows, because if everyone is in\na tiny room listening intently, they are\ngoing to know when you\u2019ve fucked it\nible layers carved out of the whirlpool\nof sounds that pulsates from the album,\nthewholeshebangjustsortoffuelsyour\nhungry adrenaline rush, simply bewil-deringly mind-blowing, I hear myself\nraving. Indeed, this scorching number\ndoes not need words, the music speaks\nfor itself 200%. It just builds and builds,\nit\u2019s almost as if you are trapped on this\nswing, swinging higher and higher, the\nrush of wind hits your face, faster and\nsharper and you feel absolute pain-free\nexhilaration. It\u2019s that good. What is refreshing with great albums is the fact\nthat you have songs that show vari-ation, not just the same old formula\nbecause our ears are innately attracted\nto new soundscapes, something fresh,\nsomething that rekindles our love for\nThe Rabbit is scared as hell indeed... frozen in the headlights... or sweetly nibbling some green munchies\nup.\nDescribe your song writing pro-cedure. What inspires you, where\nand when do ideas pop into your\nhead for new songs?\nI write in blocks, for example most of\nthe last record was written in about a\nmonth or so. I get ideas all the time but\nmost of them float away into the ether.\nI need to be sat down with an instrument and a recording device to map\nout a song. I\u2019m inspired by my own life\nI guess. It is all I know about.\nMany people describe writing\nsongs and playing music as being\nhighly cathartic, a way of communicating your inner thoughts\nand emotions, whether they are\nuplifting or anxious, whatever\nit may be, to be voiced through\ntheir music. Does this ring true\nfor you?\nI fell like my music is a good way of\nframing certain parts of my life, to\ncall it \u2018therapy\u2019 is always a bit weird. It\ncan help to put a full stop on periods\nof time when you sum them up over 4\nand a half minutes of music.\nIs there an immense sense of satisfaction or even relief when you\nfinish writing a piece? Do you\never get annoyed or frustrated\nwith yourself if things don\u2019t go to\nplan?\nSometimes it just comes out and is\ndone right there. Other songs take\nweeks or months to get right. But\nthere\u2019s no point in getting frustrated. It\nis more productive to work out what\u2019s\nwrong with it and try to change that\nsomehow.\nSo how do you normally vent out\nyour anger/frustration or maybe\nyou prefer bottling it up inside?\nI don\u2019t have a great deal of anger flying around, but any energy I have is expended when we play live. It all comes\nout in sweat and spit on the stage.\nWith the following artists, say\nwhich one you prefer and why.\nMuse or Snow Patrol?\nSnow Patrol, they are convivial nice\nchaps.\nThe Killers or U2?\nU2. They\u2019ve been brilliant for over 20\nyears.\nStereophonics or The White\nStripes?\nThe White Stripes. Monster riffs.\nMadonna or Kylie?\nKylie is less nasal and irritating.\nDuran Duran or Take That?\nDuran Duran. They play instruments.\nBlondie or The Manic Street\nPreachers?\nDifficult. Blondie have a better back\ncatalogue though.\nIf you won the lottery what would\nyou do with it?\nBuild a studio.\nName your top 3 inventions.\nThe guitar, the piano, the cassette\nrecorder.\nWho is your favourite DJ, favourite TV presenter and why?\nFavourite DJ is Richard Colburn. Favourite TV presenter is Gok Wan.\nName your perfect day. Where\nwould it be and spent with\nwhom?\nSpent rowing on a loch in the Highlands with my girlfriend.\nWhere and when did you last\nthrow up?\nIn the studio about a year ago.\nDo you think it is acceptable for\nguys to wear makeup such as eye-liner, mascara etc..?\nTotally acceptable.\nDo you have any groupies?\nDepends what you mean. Nobody\nwants to sleep with us really, but we\ndo have people who come to A LOT of\nour shows.\nWhat sort of clothes do you usually wear on stage? Casual stuff or\nsmart formal gear? What is your\nfavourite outfit?\nI have a thing for check shirts. But really whatever we\u2019ve got on that day is\nalso the stage wear.\nWhat are your greatest musical\naspirations?\nI\u2019ll be aspiring to make the perfect album until I am dead.\nWhat is your new single about?\nIt is about a trip I took to NYC to win\nback a girl.

This is the first time we get to\nhear the bittersweet vocals in conjunction with the rasping guitar that is ever\npresent. And then bang, the drums\nand thundering percussion crashes in\nand it\u2019s just sheer pandemonium. Then\nit backs down yet again and slowly\nbut surely the whole soundscape gets\nstretched out and the drum and bass\nreclaims your ears once more.\nOn the other hand, \u2018Trois Heures\u2019\nsees the Vessels changing tact again,\nthe backdrop being a desolate, gloomy,\nalmost threatening industrial land-scape, filled with gliding guitar ar-peggios, digital detritus and metallic\nelectronica. They have lots of tricks up\ntheir sleeves.\n\u2018Look at that Cloud\u2019 is an atmospheric instrumental piece that is a key track\ntaken from their inspiring arsenal. It\nis however hauntingly fragile and the\ndreamy yet achingly long synthesised\nnotes entrenched with pain evoke the\nfeeling of the engulfing loss of that\nsomeone, clinging onto the faint trails\nAlbum Review\nVessels\nWhite Fields and\nOpen Devices\nHHHHI\nof bittersweet memories.

The inclusion of the\nsoothing melodic guitar and piano interlude helps to paint a calm picture of\nsolitude, detachment from everything\naltogether.\nOther noteworthy tracks include the\nawesomely-titled \u2018An Idle Brain And\nThe Devil\u2019s Workshop\u2019, with its polyrhythm and frantic, cool guitar riff\nwork.

Can\u2019t get a job?\nCredit crunch. Food costs too much?\nCredit crunch. Your dealer went bust?\nCredit Crunch. Your girlfriend just\nleft your broke ass? Credit Crunch.\nIt\u2019s raining outside? Credit Crunch.\nEveryone blames the credit crunch\nfor just about anything, but not everyone seems to understand exactly what\nthey\u2019re talking about. Credit Crunch\nis just a media buzz-phrase that describes part of the economic situation\nwe\u2019re in. We use the phrase because\nit\u2019s easy to understand (and it rolls off\nthe tongue nicely) but if we\u2019re actually\ngoing to understand how the crisis be-gan, we need to look deeper into the\nwhole thing and consider the events\nthat started this whole crapshoot. Now\nbelieve it or not, this current crisis\nhas been looming for decades, possibly even centuries (seriously) but this\nparticular timeline is only going to the\n90\u2019s, because that\u2019s less boring.\nWant to know what the credit crunch is about, but can\u2019t find a banker to explain it to you in plain English?\nLuke Dhanoa\nBusiness Editor The 90\u2019s and the subprime\nsmorgasboard.\nFor financial folks the 90\u2019s got off to a\nrocky start. 1990 was a recession year\n(that means that the value of the economy shrank for more than six months)\nand interest rates (the percentage you\nhave to pay back on loans) were high.\nBut eventually things got better, hell\n- things got better than better, things\ngot great: the markets grew (in the US\nand UK) like nothing anyone had ever\nseen, there were new financial tools for\ntrading, interest rates were low, property prices were on the increase, things\nwere going alright. By the time New\nLabour had settled in the economy was\nin good shape, so everyone did what\neveryone always does when times are\nsweet \u2013 they got careless. So careless\nthat they started handing out subprime\nloans to people without thinking about\nthe consequences. What\u2019s subprime\nyou ask? Give that secondary article a\nread. and come back.\nS\nubprimes are actually fairly\ncomplicated, y\u2019know provided you go by the wiki.\nBut for the sake of clarity the\nsubprimes in this case are\njust loans that went out to non prime\ncandiates. Hence the \u201csub\u201d \u201cprime\u201d bit.\nWhile this isn\u2019t technically super ac-curate, it\u2019s a good starting place and\nI\u2019m sticking to it. And in case you\u2019re\nwondering why loans were given out to\npeople who weren\u2019t prime candidates,\nI\u2019m just about to explain it.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a \u201890\u2019s mortgage lender and people come to you asking for\nloans to buy houses. Your first instinct\nwould be to make sure that people can\npay back the loans you give out, right?\nThat\u2019s just common sense, right?\nWrong.\nPeople are coming to you to buy\nhouses. Once you lend them the money\nfor a mortgage they buy the house (be-coming the owner) and then pay you\nback the money in small instalments.\nFor the convenience of being able to\nborrow cash off you, they have to pay\nback more than they borrowed (inter-est). If they manage to pay you back\non time, everything is fine: You make\na profit, the person gets a house. But\nif the person can\u2019t pay back their loan,\nthings get interesting; you (the bank)\ncan take their house as payment for\nthe loan (repossession) and then sell it\noff to whoever wants it. If you can sell\nthe house off for more than the person\nowes, then you make a profit. Since it\u2019s\nthe late 90\u2019s and house prices are rising\nlike mad, you stand a chance of making a profit on repossessed houses. For\nyou, this is the best thing since sliced\nbread because you can lend money to\npeople who can\u2019t pay you back and still\nmake a profit. Since your objective is to\nmake a profit, you give mortgages out\nto people who cant pay back, for cheap.\nThe 90\u2019s rock don\u2019t they?\nAsh. Another example of 90\u2019s\nrocking.\nBut wait there\u2019s more! Let\u2019s say that\nyou\u2019re a credit card company: You give\npeople loans to spend on whatever\nthey want. When you consider giving\nsomeone a loan you put them into one\nof three groups:\nA) People who can definitely pay you\nback,\nB) People who can maybe pay you\nback,\nC) People who can\u2019t pay you back.\nObviously, you always lend to Group\nA, and never lend to Group C. But\nwhat about the \u201cmaybes\u201d in Group B?\nSome can pay you back, some can\u2019t,\nbut you have no way of knowing who\ncan and who cant. So you hire a statistician and tell him to work out how\nmany \u201cmaybes\u201d you can give loans to,\nand still make a profit. He works out\nthat you can give loans to most of the\n\u201cmaybes\u201d and even though lots of them\nwill end up bankrupt, enough will pay\nyou back to come out ahead (assuming\nthe wider economy stays the way it is).\nSo you (the 90\u2019s banker) lend money\nto people who you know will probably\nhave financial difficulty later, because\nyou can still make a profit. God bless\nthe 90\u2019s.\nWhat you\u2019ve just read is a massive\noversimplification of what happened.\nHell, I\u2019m pretty sure that a bunch of\npeople are going to try and come kill\nme for missing out on so many details and oversimplifying things. It\u2019s\nalso possible that you might think that\nsomething scandalous happened here,\nbut on balance, lax lending in the UK\nhelped lots of people live better lives.\nCheap credit got millions on the property ladder and got countless others\nthrough education. It really was a good\nthing at the time. Honest.\nRemember these boys? Remember Take That? Remember Nirvana?\nWell if you do that means you should probably remember the 90\u2019s\n2003 and the invisible WMD\u2019s\nIt\u2019s time to kick ass and chew\ngum. And I\u2019m all out of gum.\nLet\u2019s skip forward past 9/11 and into\n2003. Around about then we\u2019d recovered from the 2001 CDO collapse and\nthe big thing we\u2019re all thinking about is\nthe Iraq War. Some people were concerned that global population growth\nwas increasing the price of food, other\npeople are pointing out that the emerging economies\u2019 thirst for resources\ncould be a problem, but they are ultimately ignored because there was a war\non and war\u2019s more fun to talk about. It\nwas here that the cost of living started\nto rise but we didn\u2019t notice it. Oil cost\nbetween $20 and $40 a barrel.\n2004 to 2006\nprices skyrocketed, food got pricier.\nThis made things even harder for the\npeople who were just about keeping up\nwith their loans.\nThe mortgage and credit lenders sud-denlyhadanewproblem:thechangesin\nthe economy meant that they couldn\u2019t\nkeep making a profit with their old\nbusiness model. Because house prices\nwere falling, they couldn\u2019t make profits on dud mortgages like they used to.\nSo they tightened up lending practices\nand they sold off subprime debt to investment banks, pension funds, hedge\nfunds, and whoever else was buying,\nknowing it was worthless.\nHow do you sell debt? Well that\u2019s\neasy. Let\u2019s say you owe me a fiver and\nyou\u2019re going to pay me back in a week.\nI then tell a bank that if they give me\nfour pounds now, I\u2019ll give them the\nfiver that you owe me in a week. That\nway, I\u2019ve sold the debt.\n2007\nOne fine day in 2007 the investors\nwoke up and found out that the \u201cassets\u201d (something that makes money for\nyou) they\u2019d bought off the mortgage\nlenders were worthless. Totally worth-less. In January, HSBC fired its top\nUS chiefs while the sub-prime debts\nmushroomed. None of us noticed.\nIn May, UBS had to close its high-profile hedge fund, Dillon Reed Capital Management and some of us realised what was going down. In July, Ben\nBernanke (Chairman of the Board of\nGovernors of the United States Federal\nReserve) said that the sub-prime crisis\ncould cost $100 billion, and promised\nto tackle abusive lending. He failed. All\nof a sudden people were too scared to\ninvest. The big banks started to inject\ncapital (money and assets) into hedge\nfunds to keep them going, but it was no\ngood. The credit had crunched.\nIn September people who banked\nwith Northern Rock rushed to take\ntheir money out (remember that?). The\ninvestment banks were making huge\nlosses and bad mojo spread through\nthe economy like crabs through a\nbrothel.\nIn November, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England warned\nthat growth in the UK economy would\nslow down and inflation would rise. He\nwasn\u2019t bullshitting.\n2008\nIn January, Bear Stearns chief James\nCayne steped down as the bank revealed huge losses and the stock markets tumbled. In March, Bear Stearns\ngot bought out by JP Morgan (with\nsome help from the NY Federal Reserve) for next to nothing. People start\nto panic.\nBanker bosses started to get fired all\nover the shop and heads started rolling left right and centre. In May the\nmarket started looking like a massacre,\nbut none of us noticed because we had\nexams. In August, UK repossessions\nrose by 40 per cent because people jsut\ncouldn\u2019t pay back their mortgages.\nIn September all hell broke loose and\nLehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.\nThe US Government rescued Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac while we all get\nready for term. Then, as though they\nknew it was coming all along everyone started blaming everything on the\n\u201ccredit crunch\u201d.\nSo next time someone blames expensive food on the crunch, tell \u2018em to shut\nup. Food is expensive because there\u2019s\ntoo many people eating worldwide and\nwe\u2019re in a supply-led recession.\nWhat are subprime mortgages and why were they given out to people?\nStarving Kids be eating your food\n\n"

New research published in the\nJournal of Sexual Medicine claims that trained sexologists can\ntell whether a woman is having vaginal\norgasms induced by penetrative sex,\nsimply by looking at the way she walks.\nA number of previous studies have\ndetermined that clitoral and vaginal\norgasms are two separate physiological phenomena dependent on different\nnervous pathways. Vaginal orgasms\nhave been shown to benefit women\u2019s\nhealth: penile stimulation of the vagus\nnerve in the cervix is beneficial to cardiovascular health and also helps other\nphysiological processes such as coping\nwith stress. Women with more vaginal orgasms also have better relationship quality. The new study looked at\n16 Belgian women, half of whom had\nvaginal orgasms and half of whom did\nnot. These women were filmed walking\ndown the street and trained sexologists\nthen looked at videos to determine\nwhether a woman was orgasmic or not,\nbased on her walk. They were able to\ndo so correctly in 81% of the cases. The\nauthors say that an observer may tell\nif a woman has orgasms by looking at\nher gait \u201cthat comprises fluidity, ener-gy, sensuality, freedom and absence of\nflaccid and locked muscles\u201d. Apparently, the orgasmic women have \u201cgreater\npelvic and vertebral rotation and stride\nlength\u201d and the muscle blocks may be\nresponsible for impairment of some\nwomen\u2019s sexual potential.\nFrom an evolutionary point of view,\nif one could tell by walk alone if woman\nhas orgasms and if this is related to her\nhealth and therefore physical fitness,\none would expect men to have evolved\nways of seeing this. It might be interesting to see if any man, not just trained\nsexologists, could guess this. Even men\nin a relationship pay attention to sin-gle, attractive women. In fact, meeting\na single woman leads men to view their\nown partners in a more negative light\nthen they do, reports a study published\nin Journal of Personality and Social\nPsychology. The study tested 71 men,\nhalf of which were introduced to a sin-gle, attractive woman who flirted with\nthem, other half with a woman who\nignored them. After this experience\nthey were asked if they would forgive\ntheir partner if she cancelled a date, or\ngossiped about their private lives. Men\nwho had another woman flirting with\nthem were 12% less forgiving. Presumably the experience of a complete\nstranger flirting with them led them to\nbelieve they were too cool to be messed\naround. Maybe it increased their self-perceived mate value. Interestingly,\nfor women, the trend was opposite: after meeting an attractive, single man,\nthey were 17% more likely to forgive\ntheir partners and so were working to\nstrengthen their current relationship.\nMi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107\nScience editor\nThis weekly,\nhour-long podcast is a humorous and critical\nlook at current\ncontroversies in\npseudo-science\nand the par-anormal.

He also explores the tendency of conspiracy theorists to hitch\ntheir ideas onto genuine science \u2013 such\nas scalar field theory \u2013 and use jargon\nand pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo\nto pass off science fiction as fact.\nwww.skeptoid.com\nThis is the\nofficial\npodcast\nof Skeptic\nMagazine\nIn the US the\n\u2018skeptical movement\u2019 is growing like never before, largely due to a\npopular backlash against the anti-sci-ence stance of the current administration and at the forefront of the trend\nis the Skeptics Society magazine and\nits sister podcast, Skepticality. With\nfans such as Apple CEO Steve Jobs,\nand a growing audience of converts\nboth sides of the pond, one would expect some hard-hitting broadcasting,\nbut sadly the programme too often\nslips into navel-gazing verging on ar-rogance.

This week there\nare match reports from a whole host of\nclubs. There is news of a charity badminton tournament later this month as\nwell as a brief overview of the Baseball\nworld series.\nIf your club has any match, tour or\nevent reports, make sure you email\nthem to sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk to\nstand the chance of it being printed\nin future issues. Good luck in your\nmatches and until next week...\nPs. The sports league table is almost\nupon us!\nICBC succeed on home water\nThree was most definitely the crowd\nlast weekend for the 2008 Pair\u2019s Head\nof the River Race. Putney embankment was a flurry of activity as crews\nboated in glorious sunshine and supporters positioned themselves along\nthe course. The 4km processional head\nrace took place from Chiswick Bridge\nto Hammersmith Bridge and attracted\nover 380 boats. The quality of ICBC\u2019s\npre-season training was evident with\nImperial winning three categories and\nclocking the fastest time overall.\nPair\u2019s Head is one of the few head\nraces where coxes are unscrewed from\nthe boat and let out for a few hours.\nThe lack of calls for technique in the\nboat allows the guns to be taken out of\nretirement, and for as much banging\nup and down the slide as required in\norder to butch past other crews. It may\nnot be pretty, but it\u2019s fun.\nJust about recovered from the celebrations of winning at Henley, Simon\nHislop teamed up with ICBC\u2019s GB\nrepresentative Adam Freeman-Pask\nin the senior 1 (S1.2x) cateogory. Not\nonly did they win their category but\nthe double was the outright winner of\nthe entire head race coming home in\n11:44.0, solidifying Imperial\u2019s domination of tideway races. This is 14 seconds faster than the heavily publicised\ndoubles entry of Olympic kayaking\nchampion Tim Brabants and Olympic\nsculler Alan Campbell, who only man-ged sixth place on the day. It is highly\nrecommended that the Olympic duo\nsee Steve Trapmore at ICBC if they\nwish to improve this result. The IC pair\nare available for a photographic shoot\nand/or an interview and will be signing autographs at the Toga Party this\nSaturday in the boathouse. Tickets still\navailable!\nMeanwhile the coxes were seeking\nsolace in each other and huddling on\nthe bank, whispering and tutting at\nthe navigational errors unfolding while\nslowly coming to the horrific realista-tion that crews can actually steer and\ncox themselves.\nIn the Elite pairs category (E.2-),\nWill Todd and Ole Tietz were inspired\nby Pasklop and replicated victory in a\ntime of 12:27.4. Unassuming and un-pretentious, Will is reluctant to mention his former glory at Henley. This\nmay shock some of you, but he won\nthe Britannia Challenge Cup in 2007.\nTrue story.\nIt was Erica Thompson and Edmund Bradbury who secured the hat\ntrick for ICBC, winning the senior 3\nmixed doubles (Mx.S3.2x) category in\n12:59.9, faster than many of the men\u2019s\ncrews on the day. This is another win\nfor Thompson who has been dominating all summer collecting medals and\npots at every race. She was particularly\nexcited at the prospect of the lidded\npot prize in this event. There is no motivation stronger than the thought of a\nlid and the prospect of the myriad of\nuses for such a device.\nICBC had several entries, all giving\ngutsy performances. Congratulations\nto all participants and to Adam Seward\nwho is the unchallenged long-distance-IC-screaming champion.\nWith coxes rounded up and reinstalled into the boats it was pub time\nand ICBC made their presence felt\nalong the embankment. ICBC always\nwelcomes new members and there are\nFresher\u2019s sessions every Wednesday\nafternoons at 14:00 and Sunday mornings at 11:00 at the boathouse. See you\nthere!\nChristina Duffy\nImperial College Boat Club\nBoat Club dominate\n\n"

Although I should probably stop discussing complex economic theories with\ntramps. But I\u2019ve been looking for that\nsilver lining and, not being able to see\nthe wood for the trees, have just found\nit here at Imperial.\nIt\u2019s not the fact that eventually companies won\u2019t be able to give out free\nrazors, so self-absorbed feminist wan-nabees can go write into university\nnewspapers complaining about how\nit\u2019s an affront to their human rights\n(despite such razors coming with\nbottles of \u2013 traditionally manly \u2013 eye\nmakeup remover), although admittedly this would be nice. It\u2019s not even\nthat eventually the notion of top up\nfees will have to be abolished or that an\nunfamiliar system of overfunded comprehensive polytechnics are consistently beaten by decrepit grammar universities \u2013 although again it would be a\nrelief that Lord Patten will have some\nother elitist tripe to trawl on about.\nWhat is nice, however, is the fact that\nthe banks are collapsing. There is the\ngeneral sentiment that we shouldn\u2019t be\nbailing out the banks because they\u2019ve\nbroughtthisallonthemselves,but\u00a3288\nper person on the Earth is a small price\nto pay for preventing the end of the\neconomic world. What we shouldn\u2019t be\ndoing is bailing the bankers out.\nYou may like to think that the current climate would mean no more big\nbonuses and certainly no more cham-pagne, but parasites that work in banking will find a way to keep hold of their\ntrophy wives. It will mean, however,\nthat Imperial\u2019s endless supply of free\npens, cuddly toys, textbooks and god\nknows whatever else is being pushed\nonto students by Botox-faced \u201cexecutives\u201d who would be quite happy pushing crack to kids if it served their pur-pose. The result (not-with-standing\nthe Union Stationary Shop income\nskyrocketing), would probably be that\nstudents will follow careers in their\nchosen disciplines.\nI personally can\u2019t see the point in\ndoing a Physics Masters for four years\nor an Engineering PhD for six when\nall the graduates then intend to do is\ngamble away mine and everyone else\u2019s\nmoney in some jumped-up office in the\nCity before they go home and get their\nrocks off. Students spent years and\nhuge amounts of debt training as these\nprofessionals, and to claim it\u2019s all for\n\u201ctransferable skills\u201d is like claiming sex\nis a transferable skill for rape. Maybe it\nis a caveat of the government\u2019s policy\nof cramming people into universities\nleft right and centre, but if these students go on to work in these fields it\ncan be no bad thing. But they won\u2019t. Is\nit such a strange concept to fresh-faced\n18 year old applicants to actually want\nto do the subjects they apply for? Probably not, but the lure of fast cars and\nbonuses does much to corrupt people,\nwhich is something we could really do\nwithout at the moment. I know I\u2019m not\nthe most moral of people, but cleaning\ntarmac is expensive, and the last thing\nwe need at the moment is more jump-ers. That and more homelessness and\ndivided families, such as in the 90\u2019s.\nI don\u2019t honestly believe for one moment that all the ills in the world can\nbe solved by banning this charade of\nbroadcasting propaganda, thinly veiled\nas \u201ccareers fairs\u201d and no doubt some\nstudents make the decision to go into\nfinance for completely altruistic or academic reasons. But allowing such insti-tutionalised greed to be sanitised and\nforce-fed into the mouths of students is\ngoing to do nothing but perpetuate the\ngluttony that has already engulfed the\nfinancial sector and currently threatens\nto take us all down with it. So maybe,\njust maybe, the impending doom that\nis the credit crunch might make things\na little lighter on our shores, even if we\ndo run short on biros.\nDan Wan N\now that you\u2019re reading\nmy article after being\nutterly perplexed but simultaneously intrigued\nby its headline, I can severely disappoint you. Another moan\nabout public transport? Yes, sirree.\nDamn fucking right and it\u2019s all justified\ntoo.\nTFL, you sons of a collective bitch,\nwhy do you bother charging me horrific\namounts of money each week to sit on\nthe sweaty tin cans you call trains and\nbuses, getting progressively annoyed\nuntil I end up getting off and walking\nthe rest of the way, because it always\nturns out to be quicker? All right, that\u2019s\nnot entirely true; I once had to hobble\nall the way home after trying to jump\na railing in Piccadilly Circus, failing\nand ending up effectively hurling myself across the pavement to the horror-cum-amusement of Spanish tourists.\nThat time definitely took longer than\nthe train I would have been on.\nCome January, another price hike\nwill see minimum fares on the Underground rise to \u00a31.60, and buses to \u00a31.\nBoris blames Ken, and as a retort, Ken\nnasally goads the people of London\nfor voting Boris into office. Fuck both\nof you, Mayors of London (Seriously, I\nstill don\u2019t get that. On what, Ken? On\nyour mum.)\nI\u2019m all riled up and unnaturally aggravated at this time of day, and it\u2019s all\ndown to a couple of horrific experiences over these last couple of days. Rewind to last Sunday evening, and you\u2019ll\nsee me standing at Notting Hill Gate\ncoming back from the shitty part of my\nweek where I get treated like dirt as a\nSales Assistant. I\u2019ve decided to subject\nmyself to the seemingly unconnected\nbranches of the District Line for reasons unknown to man. All I want to do\nis get back home (Fulham Broadway)\nvia a simple 7-minute ride on a Wimbledon-bound train. \u201cNext Wimbledon\ntrain within 6 minutes,\u201d the dot matrix\nboard states. Fast forward an hour\nlater, and I\u2019m on the platform of High\nStreet Ken, the station one stop down\nthe line. The Wimbledon train took 26\nminutes, not 6 as promised. All Underground staff hate you. They only open\nthe disabled gates for you because they\ntruly think you\u2019re disabled, when really you\u2019re only limping because you\u2019ve\nkicked a train door open in frustration\nmoments before, when the driver forgot to open the doors and walked off to\ntake an undeserved break.\nI expect a little less of London buses,\nsince they\u2019re cheaper, and drivers have\nto have some skill other than pulling a\nlever up and down in accordance to red\nand green lights. Today though, this\ndriver figuratively took the piss, and\nliterally took the wrong bus route. Despite several diversion signs and road\nblockages, he managed to ignore them\nall, and found himself doing a three-point-turn on Kensington Church\nStreet. To top it all off, he decides that\nhe\u2019s too good a driver for the usual bus\nstop I get off at, and skips it altogether.\nWhy the hell not, eh?\nNot all bus drivers have the IQ of\nHangman\u2019s scrotum, though. Since\nCollege insist on giving us CID cards\nthat use the same swipe technology as\nOyster cards, I\u2019m sure every Imperial\nstudent, at some point, probably when\ndrunk coming back from the VodkaRed Bull addled night in Tiger Tiger,\nhas inadvertently swiped their College card on an Oyster reader only to\nbe met with the red light of shame and\nbuzzer noise of rejection. The one on\na par with that infamous Family Fortunes \u2018wah-woh\u2019 noise.\nNormally though, the driver just\nwants to get home because, after all,\nits 4am, and he probably has some\nsort of life that doesn\u2019t involve shifting hundreds of drunk fucks around\nLondon. So, he waves you onto the bus\nwithout a fare, thinking you\u2019re just too\ncheap to have any credit on your Oyster. And amongst the mess that is your\nbrain after 11 cheap drinks, you think,\n\u2018Wow that was actually a kind gesture\nof trust.\u2019 So, you decide to say to him\n\u201cYou\u2019re well safe, son. Let me give you a\nbiscuit.\u201d I didn\u2019t have any biscuits.\n\u201cYou\u2019re well safe, son. Let me give you a\nbiscuit.\u201d\nA\nsFreshers\u2019Weekfinished,\nI, for one, breathed a sigh\nof relief. It\u2019s bad enough\nthat this is my second\nFreshers\u2019 week at a fresh\nnew university \u2013 that\u2019s right, I\u2019m a\npostgraduate student, remember, we\nexist here too? \u2013 chock full of the same\nold hype and breathless banalities I\u2019ve\nencountered before. Now I can get on\nwith my university life \u2013 not what Mr\nStudent Cliche, in his many guises, says\nmy university life should be, which, if\nthe general events and psyche of all\nthat excitable \u2018Fresher\u2019 literature is to\nbe believed, consists of rampant drinking every night (and indeed if that\u2019s\nso, why do so many societies insist on\ninconveniently putting recruiting sessions in the early hours of the day?),\ncollecting swathes of phone numbers\nin a couple of days, and studying to get\na top class degree in tandem.\nForgive me for being a grumpy old\npostgrad of 23 years old, but I didn\u2019t\nmanage to make the \u2018drink every night\nwith your new friends!\u2019 quota for\nFreshers\u2019 week the first time round,\nwhen my liver was a healthy 18 years-old and I was as fresh-faced and shiny-eyed as I was ever likely to get. I like a\nsocial drink.\nActually, I love a social drink. But\nhangovers, beer goggles and unwise\nencounters, the college human petri\ndish, or, at the worst, heartfelt drunken\nvomiting, do not a happy introduction to university make, and I\u2019ll hazard that I cannot be the only one who\nwoke up depressed and remorseful on\nmy second day of university. This time\nround, things are also even more dif-ficult, since I\u2019m still busy enough trying to find my way around London\nand the area where I live- like almost\nevery other postgrad in private hous-ing, usually just falling under an hour\naway from Imperial (or closer to two\nhours by night bus if you want to make\nthe late events, and in a strange, prone-to-be-lost-in city? Difficult), and locate\nall the necessary rooms essential to my\ncollege life.\nMost of us agreed that Freshers\u2019\nWeek was centred , for the majority,\naround undergraduates. And here\u2019s\nthe really irritating thing I had to face\nagain \u2013 Fresher\u2019s Guilt. This is the\ndistinctive Guilt that seeps in if you\n*don\u2019t* \u2018go drinking every evening with\nFreshers\u2019 Week... it\u2019s finally over\nyour new friends\u2019 (and supposing you\nhaven\u2019t located those new, often maddeningly elusive, glorious bastards\nyet, or lost them in the human soup\nof Freshers\u2019 fair, anyway?) and instead\nfind yourself stepping back to your pad\nfor a quiet night in with your silent mobile phone. Supposing you\u2019ve had your\nfill of small talk and attempts to break\ninto protective first-week cliques, well\ntoo bad. You\u2019re an adult, you\u2019re at your\nnew university, you\u2019re in a week of purported hedonism, and you\u2019re not Out\nThere Being Part Of It. Being forced to\nhave fun at awkward events can be bad,\nbut being forced to feel like you should\ndefinitely be having fun is worse.\nI admired efforts to secure vaguely\nfamous entertainment names on two\nnights of the week- one up on my old\nuni there- but might I suggest welcoming events that don\u2019t involve late nights\nand cocktails at the Union, but instead\nfree food and movie nights, lunchtime\nbarbeques, theatre shows, society dis-plays, and dinners? Might I suggest\nthat those producing written material\nfor Freshers stop drawing on the same\nboring cliches? Yes, I get it... Freshers\ncan\u2019t cook, wash laundry, or even wash\nthemselves, if this year\u2019s handbook is\nto be believed. Freshers are cute, naive,\nand good looking, like bunny rabbits.\nFreshers will soon become proudly\ncynical and hardened like the current\n2nd or 3rd years, like weasels. Freshers will be partying madly all the time,\nhaving the best years of their life (it\u2019s\nall downhill from here, folks!) whilst\nsimultaneously breezing through the\nthree or more most academically challenging and trying years of their life. I\ncan only assume this last statement is\ntrue, since most writers prefer not to\ndetail much about the realities of academic study at university when there\u2019s\negotistical, lazy fun to be poked at new\nstudents. References to the lingering\nstung pride of supposedly being Oxbridge rejects, ho-ho, never gets old,\nthe potential Dark Path of investment\nbanking / management consulting /\n\u2018corporate whoring\u2019 (seems to be the\ntrendy term now) which no doubt lies\nahead in the Real World for the naive\nnew student... sigh.\nHere\u2019s a few tips. First, stop patronising Freshers. Sure, we need help in\ngetting integrated with Imperial, but\nstop writing all the old cliches. Not all\nof us are a) Undergraduates b) Naive c)\nAmused. Second, break away from the\nboring pattern of evening alcohol as a\nmedium to fun and new pals in Freshers Week and find better ways to get\nus used to this place. Third, for God\u2019s\nsake stop insisting that these are going\nto be the best years of anyone\u2019s life, or\nelse continue sowing seeds of unnecessary worry in the minds of those who,\neventually realising that in a short time\nthe supposed best years are going to be\nover and yet life still doesn\u2019t feel like\nElysium and ambrosia now, that they\nclearly are doing university wrong.\nFourth, hide the level of sexual frustration seeping into certain felix writings\n(irrelevant but there seems a heck of a\nlot of sexual innuendo and male rogering jokes pasted through what I\u2019ve read\nof felix\u2019s more casual laddish pieces so\nfar, there\u2019s no game in trying to spot\nit).\nHonestly? So far, I\u2019m very much looking forward to a year of Imperial. No,\nI\u2019m not a bitter and scarred old young\nkilljoy, I\u2019m happy to be here. But boy,\nam I glad I got through Freshers\u2019 Week\nagain. Now my university life can actually begin.\nAnnabel\nSlater\nI\nfound your response to the\nHangman section strangely sad.\nYou seem to be labouring under\nthe misapprehension that the\nauthors were being remotely\nserious!\nLet x be the length of time you have\nspent at Imperial College. As somebody who has endured Imperial life for\n(3x + 12)/3.75 (Sorry I couldn\u2019t resist\nan Imperial joke\u2026) I\u2019ll give you some\nadvice about how to survive this terrible experience of being surrounded\nby desperate men. If you want to experience real sexual harassment \u2013 go\nand get a job on a building site/oil rig,\nor as a fire-fighter, or even in a bank!\nThese are places where attitudes will\nnot change no matter how many letters you write and in which the women\nwho work are the ones really making a\ndifference to womens\u2019 rights. The only\nway in which you get some respect is\nthrough hard work, a good sense of\nhumour and looking all right in a skirt\nwhen you go for a drink after work.\nWe will always live in a society where\nmen and women don\u2019t have equal\nrights, this is because they are differ-ent. Do yourself a favour and look at\nthe real inequality and injustice in the\nworld and don\u2019t harp on about a group\nof lads just having a joke.\nYours\nLC (PG)\nDear Susie Peng/\nChao Cui\nW\nhat appeared in the\nHangman section\nthat caused this\nuproar was clearly\nnot a serious ar-ticle. In fact, as one may have figured\nout from the name HaxzorMcRandy_1\nwe are clearly dealing with someone\nwho spends a considerable time of his\nlife on the Internet. Not only that, but\ngiven the titles like epic Fail and at least\nover 9000 more hints within his arti-cles, he has clearly crawled from the\ndark side of the Internet.\nAnyway, what I was meaning to get\nto, is that he is what is known as a\ntroll\u2026 and an obvious, though success-ful, one at that. If you\u2019re now thinking\nof a large fat creature that has more\nmuscles than brains\u2026 or even worse\nsome messed-up warped WoW version of this mythical creature I should\nexplain in a bit more detail. Everything\nthat was stated in those articles was\noverdone and tailored specifically to\nstrike a nerve and trigger a reaction,\nand doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the true\nopinion of the author, yet alone Imperial as a whole.\nThis is a common practice on the Net\nand is referred to as trolling\u2026those\npeople who are na\u00efve enough to take\nthe comments seriously in turn have\n\u201cbeen trolled\u201d, and hardly deserves a\n\u201crallying of the silent majority\u201d.\nThat said, whether such articles and\ntrolls should necessarily be represented\nin our student newspaper, or whether\nthis is a form of humour that is best\nkept to the forums it belongs to, is perhaps a question both the editor and the\nauthor should consider carefully.\nYours\nLulzkiller\nT\noday I received an insult\n(whoops... I\u2019ve just been\ninformed that they\u2019re actually \u2018witty retorts\u2019) and\nlaughed. That\u2019s right. Me.\nWoman. Sexist (joke) insult. Laugh.\nSome people at this university really\nneed to grab the rod that is shoved\nso far up their arse that they can\u2019t appreciate a joke, give it a good twist and\never so carefully remove it from their\noverused orifice. Okay... Deep breath...\nIn case you haven\u2019t gathered, this\nis being written in response to our\n\u2018amusement\u2019 stimulated by a certain\nclich\u00e9-ridden article in last week\u2019s felix (we had to force ourselves to finish\nthe bloody thing to write about it in its\nentirety).\nNow we\u2019ve read the article which has\nobviously caused such great offence\n(you know... balanced opinion etcetera\netcetera), and ended up feeling quite\nsorry for Haxz0rMcRandy_1 (if he\nneeds to repeatedly tell us about his\nconquests... it\u2019s obvious he hasn\u2019t had\none since his Freshers\u2019 Week). As for a\ncertain \u2018feminine\u2019 article - firstly, there\nhas been a massive sense of humour\nfailure on the author\u2019s behalf and those\nwho so needlessly showed support to\ntheir article by allowing their names to\nappear in association with it.

Did you hear\nabout the new Roman Emperor who\u2019s\nmoved in downstairs? Rich tosser. He\u2019s\nrented the Reading Room until the end\nof October!\nHornakht: Yeah, goes by the name of\nPublius Aelius Hadrianus. Who does\nhe think he is coming up here from\nthe 1st century AD and bringing all his\nclobber with him?\nNes: (in lowered tones) I heard he\nbrought his wife AND his male lover\nwith him.\nHorn: Well slap my thigh and call me\nOsiris!\nNes: To be fair on the guy, at least all\nhis bits and pieces weren\u2019t stolen by the\nBritish in the 1800\u2019s.\nHorn: True. I was told he has a superb collection of goodies from museums all over the continent. Maybe we\nshould give him a break, Nesperennub.\nAfter all, he is sponsored by BP.\nSo, after much pestering of the boyfriend to accompany me, I wangled a\nticket and set off to learn about this\nEmperor Hadrian. Hadrian is one of\nthose Roman Emperors who you\u2019ve\nheard off but don\u2019t know anything\nabout\u2026 except for that great big \u2018eff\noff\u2019 wall in Scotland which he put his\nname to. We are all familiar with that\nweirdo Nero, the shanked Julius Caesar\nand Marcus \u201cthat old guy off Gladiator\u201d Aurelius, but actually a lot of what\nwe know today as \u201cAncient Rome\u201d was\nformed by Hadrian. He was an incredibly innovative guy! I mean, he was the\n1st emperor with a beard and a penchant for the Greeks \u2013 trendsetter!\nI had not been to see the Terracotta\nWarriors and had heard that the exhibition space in the newly converted\nReading Room had been cramped\nand frantic. I was pleasantly surprised\nwhen we entered the exhibition to find\nit open plan, airy and atmospheric,\nwith plenty of ventilation in the floor\nfor Marilyn Monroe moments. What\nI wasn\u2019t pleased with was the price of\nthe audio guides. I have an aversion\nto audio guides at the best of times\nbut when they\u2019re priced at \u00a33.50 they\nare most definitely surplus to require-ments. Thankfully, there is definitely\nenough written information to keep\nyou occupied and entertained although you will possibly miss out on\na couple of anecdotes by skipping the\naudio guide.\nThe exhibition starts with a huge\nbust of Hadrian and his sandal-clad\nfoot. When a statue is this big, it rarely\nsurvives this long intact due to the or-Diamond studded skulls and ponies\nWhile we suffer, the arts world invest their six figures in pickled sharks and ponies. Rosie Milton reports.\nWhen I heard that Sotheby\u2019s auction\nhouse would be holding an exclusive\nsingle artist sale \u2013 a move unprecedented for the salerooms, even since its establishment in 1744 \u2013 I was interested\nto see which artist had boldly chosen\nto sell his work through this house. To\ndiscover that it was the controversial\nDamien Hirst, I expected nothing less\nfrom the sale than astronomical sums\nspent and I revelled in the sale\u2019s delightfully ironic title \u2013 \u2018Beautiful Inside\nMy Head Forever\u2019.\nMost recently Hirst has been in the\nmedia glare and under incredulous\nspeculation from anyone interested\nin art (or money) - prior to this sale of\ncourse - when he sold his unforgettable piece, \u2018For The Love Of God\u2019 for a\ncool \u00a350 million to an unknown investor (rumoured to be George Michael,\nfor those of you interested in auction\nroom gossip). This human skull is encrusted with 8,601 diamonds and as\nthe press release for its \u2018debut\u2019 pointed\nout, it was \u201cthe most expensive piece\nof contemporary art ever created\u201d.\nGround-breaking contemporary art or\nelaborate disco ball? You decide.\nThis seems to be the norm with any\ndiscussion regarding Hirst and his\nmaelstrom of conceptual art. The secret to his success is one I will try and\ndecipher for you. If we look at his pro-duction, he almost always takes an ordinary object (for example a few empty\ncartons from a pharmacy counter, or\neven a shark or two), puts it in a box\nor sticks it on a canvas and then makes\nmillions from it. But although I have\nbroken the \u2018technical\u2019 process down\nhere, it still does not explain his suc-cess. To understand that we must turn\nto the hungry consumers of his art \u2013\nthe wealthy \u2018collectors\u2019.\nAs long as there has been art, it has\nhad a purpose for display and collec-tion. When the art auction became a\nsteadfast thing, it introduced the sport\nof competition in collecting. Today\nit is viable to say, especially in terms\nof modern art, that this competition\nfar outweighs the desire for collect-ing. The auction house has become a\nshowroom not only to view the art on\nsale but also for those wealthy enough\nto indulge in the sport of bidding to\ndisplay their millions in an almost grotesque fashion.\nHowever, sitting amongst the crowd\non the morning of the second part of\nthe sale of September this year, I noticed that the majority of bids came\nfrom the crowded bank of telephone\nbidders along the side walls, or from\npeople dotted throughout the room\nwith their mobile phones constantly\nstuck to their heads, vicariously gambling away other people\u2019s money on\nthe lots of the day. This apparent absence of actual buyers to a saleroom is\nnowhere near a new phenomenon to\nthe modern auction house, but I think\nthat under the circumstances of such a\ncontroversially exceptional sale such as\nthis, it is especially poignant.\nOne lot that I witnessed being sold\nwas \u2018The Dream\u2019, a grey foal in formaldehyde solution with a horn emerging from the centre of its forehead,\nemulating the fantastical unicorn. This\nsold for \u00a32,050,000 (not including the\nbuyer\u2019s premium of 15%). And where\nwas the buyer? Not in the saleroom, for\nsure, but bidding through his (or her)\nrepresentative. This of course raises\nthe issue of discretion \u2013 if you had invested a few million in any of Hirst\u2019s\npieces I feel sure it would be a bold\nmove to let people publicly know it\nhad been you \u2013 his work is as we know,\ncontroversial \u2013 but even more so is the\nmoney people are willing to spend on\nit. So who are the game players in the\nauction world?\nRussian oligarch Roman Abramovich is one (recognised in the UK as the\nowner of Chelsea football club), but\nin the art world he is known for being\nflanked by his \u2018fashionista\u2019 girlfriend\nDasha Zhukova, who recently opened\nthe \u2018Garage\u2019 Centre for Contemporary\nCulture in Moscow (with a little \u2018help\u2019\nfrom her boyfriend of course).\nAnother post-sale rumour is that\nAbramovich bought the key piece from\nthe first part of the sale - \u2018The Golden\nCalf\u2019 for \u00a310.3 million \u2013 another bestial soup, but embellished with 18 carat\ngold horns and hooves. Over the two-day sale, Hirst achieved \u00a3111 million\nand only five of 223 works did not sell.\nDuring the week of the sale, elsewhere in the money world the Lehman\nBrothers collapsed and there was further trouble on Wall Street. In the ensuing weeks terms such as \u2018Black Friday\u2019, disaster and crisis have not ceased\nto cry out at us from the front pages of\nthe press. What a comparison then to\nthe gross frittering away of millions of\nUS dollars or pound sterling (or even\nRussian rubles) at the Sotheby\u2019s sale\nof Damien Hirst\u2019s work. I\u2019m sure Karl\nMarx is turning in his grave.\nWhat of the future of the art world\nthen? Will the frequenters of the auction house salerooms always have millions to play with, or will they diminish and fade away in the coming years?\nWill the exorbitant expenditure on art\nchange too, or will the stakes continue\nto rise higher and higher? Perhaps we\nmay be witnessing the last runners in\nthe race to desperately spend groundbreaking millions before they disappear into the black hole of the global\nfinancial crisis.\nAtleastnowweknowthattheHadron\nCollider really did achieve something,\neven if only metaphorically. At the end\nof the two-day sale, even if you couldn\u2019t\nafford a Hirst yourself, then at least you\ncould spend a hearty \u00a350 on the set of\nthree catalogues which come complete\nwith stickers of butterflies, fake dia-monds, pills, fags and a pickled calf so\nsupposedly you can have a go at making your own art (I know of one for sale\nif anyone\u2019s interested).\nOtherwise, who knows, you might\ndo a Hirst and make a few million out\nof it (that is if there\u2019s any millionaires\nleft that he hasn\u2019t sucked dry yet). If\nyou do, let us know if its beautiful inside your head forever after.\nganic nature of the joints attaching the\ngargantuan arm or 80cm foot to the\ntorso. Still, the sizes of the remaining\nbits are impressive and the details are\nstill there. Hadrian\u2019s sandal is the best\nin Roman design \u2013 eat your heart out\nTopman - and the curls of his barnet\nare trimmed to perfection.\nThe line you take through the highly\ndisorientating space has been very\nwell thought out by the curators.\nEvery single campaign of Hadrian\u2019s is\ndemonstrated with the best artefacts.\nEvery last coin is explained and adds\nsomething to our knowledge of this\nfinest Roman emperor. To keep us in-terested, there are more than enough\nunusual relics in the exhibition so we\ndon\u2019t get bored with the generic Roman objects. I loved the double headed\ncameo of Trajan and Plotina, which is\na thousand years old but looks like it\u2019s\nfresh out of Wedgewood.\nThroughout the exhibition we also\nget to know several of Hadrian\u2019s peers\nand contemporaries: the most of whom\nwas Antinous his Greek lover. In a time\nwhere it was acceptable to take a male\nlover as well as your wife, Hadrian worshiped Antinous. The original script of\na Greek hunting poem really showed\nHadrian\u2019s devotion to him. It was all\nquite sweet.\nI don\u2019t think I have ever been so impressed with an exhibition due to the\nextent to which we really feel familiar\nwith Hadrian\u2019s personality, as if we\nwere one of his citizens. I felt respect\nand awe for this innovative emperor.\nThe presence of so many images of him\nfamiliarises us with his hamster cheeks\nand cherub hair which really helps us\nto get to know \u201cthe man behind the\nwall\u201d. You do leave the exhibition feeling very Roman: educated, superior\nand a little bit gay.\nDiamond encrusted skull rumoured to be owned by George Michael\nWannabe art conoisseur, Dasha Z\nStoppard-ed in my tracks byIvanov\nAn adaptation of Chekhov\u2019s Ivanov by Tom Stoppard is deemed a trove of acting talent, claims Caz Knight\nP\nerhaps the Donmar West\nEnd\u2019s production of Anton\nChekhov\u2019s Ivanov comes\nto the stage at the correct\nmoment given the climate\nof expanding Russian art gracing the\ngreat auction houses of \u201cMoscowon-Thames\u201d (as London has become\nknown in Russia).\nMy previous experience of Chekhov\nat the theatre was a brilliant version of\nThe Seagull, but ponderous and slightly difficult to understand nonetheless.\nAdd this to the fact that Kenneth Branagh was deemed to make his comeback by storming the West End, after\na 19-year break from the stage, and I\nhad visions of an evening spent sitting\nthrough one soliloquy after another as\nIvanov struggles to overcome his lassitude and hollowness against the backdrop of a grey and sparsely dress stage.\nHow very very wrong I was.\nIvanov was Chekhov\u2019s first attempt at\nwriting a full-length play and it turned\nout to be a labour of love, or will to establish himself as a serious dramatist.\nHe rewrote it tirelessly after a first edition in 1887 to better capture the spiritual sickness of his protagonist as he\nsuffers the bitter autumn of his life.\nAs a medic, Chekhov made a detailed study of what he called the Russian Condition \u2013 a blend of conscience\nand apathy that he weaves into the\nplay among many of the characters\nbut most markedly and importantly\nin Ivanov. Chekhov draws on his own\npersonal experiences as Ivanov marries a Jewess at the prospect of a heft\ndowry but eventually falls out of love\nand into depression, driving her away\nand into her deathbed. A brief engagement to the young, girlish Sasha ends\nwith Ivanov\u2019s suicide minutes before\nthe wedding.\nThe play starts and ends with a bang:\na loud, shock-inducing gun shot which\ncalls us to attention making us aware\nthat we are about to experience something fantastic. Tom Stoppard\u2019s adaptation of Chekhov\u2019s work is obvious instantly with the modern turn of phrase\nand jokes which pour forth from the\ncharacters onto an appreciative audience - much to Ivanov\u2019s annoyance\nand distress. Stoppard has done an\nastounding job at creating such a witty\n(evident from the audience\u2019s rambunctious laughter) and well-oiled script\nwhich is not only easy to, but a delight\nto digest.\nThe essence of the Donmar is still\npresent with its modest and slightly\nsombre stage setting which captures\nthe weary spirits of the characters of\npre-revolutionary, rural Russia. Indeed\na contrast to the gloriously plush Wyndham\u2019s theatre.\nFar from being Branagh\u2019s show,\nthe superb cast, directed by Michael\nGrandage, comes together to ensure\nthe seamless flow of humour (even a\nfew phallic jokes) which is juxtaposed\nwith their own supposed weariness\nand debt and with that of Ivanov\u2019s more\npronounced and obvious misery. Branagh is surprisingly underwhelming in\nhis performance which only conveys\nhis characters feelings of emptiness.\nThe result is outstanding and his sheer\ntalent obvious from his near perfect\nability to transition between frustra-tion, anger, despair, cynicism, flippan-cy, indifference and sadness. He leaves\nus wanting to do nothing but give him\na huge cuddle as he huddles shaking,\nred-eyed, lip a-trembling under the table \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Quite\ndifferent to his role of self-assured Professor Lockhart in Harry Potter and\nthe Chamber of Secrets!\nTwo young and beautiful troves of\nacting talent sure to suceed are Tom\nHiddleston and Andrea Riseborough,\nboth RADA graduates like Branagh.\nHiddleston and his lion-like good\nlooks are quite a contrast to his previous role as the virile Cassio in Othello,\nas he takes on the role of Anna Petrovna\u2019s Doctor who is too honest for his\nown good, despised by all in the village.\nHis anger and indignation at Ivanov\u2019s\ntreatment of his wife are carried off\nwith skill as are his audience-addressed\nmusings. Riseborough astounded with\nher bold and energetic portrayal of the\nimpetuous Sasha, oddly reminiscent\nof Ellen Page\u2019s Juno McGuff, with her\nfrank and dry humour.\nI left in amazement and confidant\nthat the next year at the Wyndham\u2019s is\ngoing to be one of 24 carat caliber with\nTwelfth Night, Madame de Sade and\nHamlet (to be directed by Branagh)\nfeaturing some phenomenal actors.\nPerhaps the critics are right and we\nare definitely entering a new, golden\nage for theatre. Ivanov would certainly\nsuggest so.\nKenneth Branagh is Ivanov, the middle-aged rural Russian, plagued with lassitude and a dying wife. I\u2019m not quite sure what is going on in this picture...\n\n"

Haven\u2019t we\nseen enough of them? Well actually,\nno, as Taken is a surprisingly different\ntake on a worn-out formula.\nBryan,aCIAbodyguard(Neeson),has\ndecided that the only thing worthwhile\nin his life is his daughter Kim (Grace),\nso he stops working for the American\ngovernment in order to make up for the\ntime he has lost with her. Determined to\nsee Kim as much as he can, Bryan visits\nKim on her 17th birthday to try and rebuild their tattered relationship. Soon\nafter the lavish party that her mother\n(Janssen) and stepfather have thrown\nfor her, Bryan discovers that Kim has\nonly one birthday wish: to go to Paris\nwith her friend so that she can explore\nEurope. At first Bryan is adamant; he\nknows the dangers of the outside world\nand refuses to give her permission to\ngo. But after he realises that this is what\nshe really wants, he gives in and allows\nher to leave. But as soon as Kim arrives\nin Paris, she meets a charming stranger\nand is then kidnapped, an event that\nBryan hears happening via her mobile\nphone. Bryan must now race against\ntime and use all of his CIA knowledge\nto track down the people responsible\nIn Taken, see for yourself that formulaic doesn\u2019t have to mean boring and unoriginal.\nand find his beloved daughter before\nshe disappears for good. Can he find\nher? And if he does, will she be alive?\nTaken utilises a conventional plot but\ncleverly makes it unconventional by\nchanging the way that the protagonist\ngoes about finding his daughter. As we\nalready know that he is ex-CIA, we\ncan accept that what he is doing is realistic and because he attempts to find\nhis daughter in a very methodical and\nlogical way, the film is much more believable then the standard Hollywood\naction movie. The script and camera\nwork are very good, and the violence\nand action sequences are original and\nexciting. As usual, the star of the show\nNeeson gives a commanding and likeable performance, dominating the film\nby humanizing it and making us care\nabout him. Although some of the fighting scenes are fairly grisly, and the plot\nhas elements some people may find uncomfortable (sex slavery), the film fits\ntogether well and keeps the pace and\nexcitement lasting for the entire time.\nConsidering that the tension is quickly\nbuilt up from the opening credits, my\nmain criticism would be the ending.\nHowever as most audience members\nwould be familiar with formulaic plot\nstyles, they would probably enjoy the\nrewarding conclusion considering all\nof the terror that goes before it.\nTaken is a better-than-average, engrossing and intelligent, action-packed\nthriller that is enjoyable to watch. Although it is not ground-breaking or\nentirely unique, it passes the time ef-ficiently. So if you find yourself stuck in\na cinema, struggling to decide what to\nwatch, then give Taken a chance, and\nyou will probably enjoy it.\nI\nhave to confess I like autumn.\nNot only when the weather is\nnicer than during summer like\nit has been in this past week or\nso, but also when the leaves are\nturning yellow and all that lights them\nup are cars passing by with headlights\nturned on to dispel the rain and fog.\nBecause let\u2019s face it, what can be more\npleasant than sitting in a cinema chair\nwith the seemingly obligatory bucket\nof popcorn and a barrel of Coke waiting for a movie to start, knowing that\noutside there is a loud, grey, wet world\nthat always turns out to be more boring than the film you are about to experience with Digital Dolby Surround,\nHD and a screen the size of a double-decker bus. And\u2026 autumn is when the\nBFI London Film Festival takes place.\nThis year it starts on the 15th of October and for fifteen days Londoners get\na chance to exercise their skills of film\ncriticism on hundreds of movies from\naround the globe. Of course that is the\ntheory; the reality is a bit less glamor-ous. How do you get 12 million people\ninto a screening room that seats 200?\nWhy are a quarter of the movies shown\nproduced in Hollywood? But most im-portantly, how do you choose which\nfilms to see?\nTheoretically you could see all of\nthem. If you had a few thousand quid\nto spare and possessed the very common ability to be in multiple places at\nthe same time or to travel across London in under twenty minutes, that is.\nYou probably won\u2019t be able to get even\na single ticket now (I should know, I\nchecked and got sorely disappointed),\nbut I think it\u2019s worth pointing out some\nmovies anyway. And I won\u2019t mention\nthe \u2018big\u2019 names of the Opening Gala\nlike Frost/Nixon, Slumdog Millionaire or Quantum of Solace, they will\nget their share of publicity and hype\nwithout me having to point them out\nto you.\nBased on my extremely subjective\njudgement of film synopses provided\nby the British Film Institute in a monster of a booklet the size and length of\na good magazine, I would recommend\nthe following; Indonesian Film Noir\nThe Secret (Kala) in which a gay cop and\nnarcoleptic journalist chase a phantom\nkiller through Suharto\u2019s Jakarta. An Iranian road movie, Loose Rope (Rismane\nBaz), that ignores politics in order to\nshow the difference between rural and\nurban with plenty of good humour and\na bit of sting to remind us that not all is\nwell with the world. A Japanese tragi-comedy, Routine Holiday (Huangjin\nZhou), in which poet Li Hongqi examines the idea of wasting time doing\nnothing in particular (I don\u2019t know why\nthe protagonists aren\u2019t students) in an\nunderstated-albeit-dreamy way. Also\nthe Polish Tricks (Sztuczki), a great\nsuccess in its homeland, looks like it\ncould conquer the West as well with\na nostalgic, witty and optimistic story\nabout a young boy raised by his sister.\nAnd for those who like their movies to\nbreak the classic Hollywood narrative,\nA Lake (Un Lac) by Philippe Grandrieux promises to do just that. Who\nknows, maybe some will eventually get\nthe wide release they deserve.\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nTaken HHHKK\nDirector: Pierre Morel\nWriter: Luc Besson\nRobert Mark Kamen\nCast: Liam Neeson,\nMaggie Grace,\nFamke Janssen\nJonathan Dakin\nCinematography? Pah, it\u2019s all in the\nsoundtrack.\nIt\u2019s there in the water. Derr derr. It\u2019s\ngoing to eat those innocent bathers.\nDerr derr. Its shark fin glistens in the\nsunlight, as Dave the \u2018special effects\nbloke\u2019 pants away, trying to pull a fibreglass triangle across a swimming pool.\nJaws, what a masterpiece. You have\nto have respect for the way in which\na film like Jaws is able to elicit such\npowerful emotions from its audience,\nusing only the limited resources of the\n1970s. I was well and truly hidden behind my big fluffy Powerpuff-Girls pillow whilst watching that famous scene.\nTruly shocking. How on earth did they\nget people to buy it? It\u2019s simple, derr\nderr*.\nTry watching the same scene whilst\nmuted, and suddenly all tension is lost.\nIt\u2019s as though someone has added the\nsubtitle \u201cIt\u2019s just a film, you\u2019re only in\na cinema, stop eating your neighbour\u2019s\npopcorn\u201d. You\u2019re brought smashing\nback down to earth, the illusion shat-tered, with the sudden realisation that\nyou\u2019ve got a numb arse. It demonstrates\nthe importance of a great soundtrack:\nthe haunting string section, set over\nthunderous brass, with Dave tinkling\nthe triangle occasionally. It\u2019s the spine-tingling, buttock-clenching fuel that\ndrives the movie head on into the wall\nof emotion (and if that isn\u2019t a contrived\nmetaphor, I don\u2019t know what is). Without its triumphant, jubilant score, Indiana Jones would be transformed from\na whip-lashing, \u00fcber-exploring hero\ninto: Mr Jones & Son, Antiquarians\nand Odd Jobs. Jurassic Park would be\nlittle more than a documentary of London Zoo on a Tuesday.\nOf course there are those films which\nby their very definition require no\nsound at all. They are, of course, Silent\nFilms. However all those people are\nnow dead, so we don\u2019t need to worry\nabout that genre any more. Other films\nthat require no sound include any\nof the Harry Potter series. Strangely\nenough those are also films that require no visuals either, and in fact,\nshould never have been made. Now if\nthere are any HP Movie fans out there\nwho found that comment a little harsh,\nI would recommend learning to read\ninstead.\nOf course if you\u2019re feeling a little\nmore adventurous you could always\ntry switching soundtracks. I liked\nThe Shining, but felt that it lacked the\ntrue swing and flair of the Sixties. So\nby swapping the original desolate and\nchilling score with that from Austin\nPowers, the Spy who Shagged Me, there\nis instantly more joie de vivre, or as I\nprefer to say, va va voom.\nPerhaps \u2018Eye of the Tiger\u2019 was wasted\non Rocky III. Imagine how much better the Sound of the Music would have\nbeen, if they\u2019d been singing along to\n\u201cthe thrill of the fight\u201d instead? Or how\nabout cheering up the more depressing bits of Braveheart with the Ghostbusters theme?

In\nDean Spanley the \u2018inevitable\u2019 is more\noften than not referred to a most dispiriting event such as a death of a son,\ndemise of a wife etc., but the inevitability of this movie reaching the screens\nin December is without a doubt a wonderful thing.\nSet in England in the year 1904, the\nfilm narrates a story (through the voice\nof Jeremy Northam) of a chance encounter leading to a series of dinner\ninterviews which change the lives of an\nestranged father and son. The father\nis Horatio Fisk, played by eight-time\nAward nominee Peter O\u2019Toole who\ndoes a remarkable job with his portrayal of an old jaded Englishman with\nan exemplary stiff upper lip.\nThe son is Hounslow Fisk (Jeremy\nNortham) \u2013 alone, middle-aged and\ntired of his father\u2019s wisdoms. Theirs\nis a typical relationship based on obligation and badly feigned affection,\nbut one that we see transformed onscreen by the most unusual of events.\nAt a lecture on the transmigration\nof the soul, which the Fisks attend to\nfight the boredom of the routine they\nfind themselves in, Horatio becomes\nintrigued by a certain dean, Spanley\n(Sam Neill). Subsequent incidental\nrun-ins will lead the younger Fisk to\ninvite Spanley to dinner, assuring his\npresence by promising a bottle of Imperial Tokay to accompany the food.\nOne dinner turns to several when the\nStuart Higgins\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\ndean\u2019s weakness for Tokay results in\nastonishing stories about his past.\nThe movie is described as an eccentric\ncomedy-drama. Well, it\u2019s more than\neccentric, this dialogue-driven film is\npreposterous, bordering on the absurd.\nWatching the dinner scenes one can\u2019t\nstop asking with wide-eyed surprise\n\u2018Are they [producers, actors, writers]\nfor real?\u2019 and despite that, the laughter\ncomes tumbling uncontrollably from\none\u2019s throat; laughing as much at the\ndialogues and the story on screen as\nat oneself for falling for it. And somewhere between the laughter you\u2019ll witness a touching story of one man\u2019s rediscovery of humanity and his surprise\nat seeing that he still has a heart.\nHis name is Bond, James Bond, and\nalthough you have seen him return\ntwenty times before, this time he is\nreturning with only one thing on his\nmind: vengeance.\nAfter the explosive finale to Casino\nRoyale, Bond is on the warpath to\ntrack down those responsible for the\ndeath of the woman who almost stole\nhis heart. But along the way, what will\nhe discover? Who really was behind\nthe events that unfolded in the previous film? What other shocking secrets\nwill be discovered along the way? And\nmost importantly: can revenge be his?\nJonathan Dakin Daniel Craig, in his second outing as\nBond, will be surrounded by gorgeous\ngirls in the form of Ukrainian beauty\nOlga Kurylenko and English sexpot\nGemma Arterton, old favourites including M (Judi Dench) and Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), and a brand new\nvillain called Dominic Greene, played\nby French actor Mathieu Amalric.\nCan the new Bond film really live\nup to the hype? This reporter says yes,\nand promises to be the first in line at\nthe nearest cinema, dressed in a tux\njust like his hero, as soon as the film\nis released.\nQuantum of Solace will be released\nnationwide on October 31st.\nComingsoon\nMust-see films set to arrive in\na cinema near you!\nBryan Brown advertising his latest film\nLiam Neeson, slightly older James Bond maybe?\nThe actual James Bond with a very angry looking lady! Take a wild guess\n\n"

Geek\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of felix\nCaz Knight\nG\nlobal warming has\nstepped aside and let\ncredit crunch/crisis/\ncommotion take centre\nstage. The very word\n\u2018crunch\u2019 evokes the image of our worldly possessions crushed under our collapsing homes, forced into dilapidation\nby our impending poverty. But for all\nthe frequency with which we hear that\nphrase (and others such as \u2018recession\u2019,\n\u2018FTSE\u2019 and \u2018merchant banker\u2019) I wonder how many people actually know\nwhat the Hell is going on and what implications it will have on us. It is with\nsome timorousness that I embark on\nthis opinion, for I am a girl with little experience of the world\u2019s financial\nmarkets and my experience of Canary\nWharf begins and ends in the tube station\u2019s extensive adjoining food court.\nTo sum up the fiscal events until this\npoint briefly and, I hope, not errone-ously, it all began with banks in America lending money to homebuyers. The\nbank used the claims on these homebuyers\u2019 mortgages as security for loans\nthe banks would take out themselves to\nuse for investments in hedge-funds, for\nexample. These investments took place\neven before the homebuyers had paid\nback their debts. It was only when the\nbanks had borrowed up to five times\nwhat these original debts were worth,\nthat it become clear that homebuyers\nwere unable to pay off these mortgag-es. Lehman Bros. had no option but\nto close. We in the UK feel the shock\nwaves as many of the hedge-funds had\nBritish banks investing. Any decrease\nin a bank\u2019s assets will have repercussions on us, the savers. Less money for\nthem, less for us as they stop lending\nto us in the form of credit. We are no\nlonger at liberty to spend tomorrow\u2019s\nmoney today.\nWhat riles me most about this debacle is just how the Media is portraying\nthe economic situation. My confusion\nbegan when I read headlines telling us\nof \u2018meltdowns\u2019, \u2018Black Thursdays\u2019 and\n\u2018crises\u2019. I look at the world around me\nand everything is still in its place. I still\nhave my health, my friends, my family\nand everything else I had before this\nsensationalism: probably even more,\nin fact. For a real crisis look at the carnage from a natural disaster or Zimbabwe. Admittedly, the economy has the\npotential to wreak real havoc such as\ndeath and famine but that is in the circumstances of a depression. We have\nnot even arrived at recession yet. If the\ncountry reaches a state of depression, I\nwill eat my words.\nHowever, the Media is doing a brilliant job of creating a recession by\ninspiring fear and stinginess in the\npopulation. This will only accelerate\nthe recession if less money is being\npumped into our economy. I despair\nthat people will blindly swallow what\nthe Media puts forth without consid-ering: How much of my expenditure is\nreliant on credit? Will the bank reduce\nwhat it offers to lend me? And by how\nmuch do I have to curb my spending? If\nthe answer is many hundreds or thousands then you have every right to be\nworried and I suggest you eat beans\nout of the can for a while. (I enjoy this\nhabit: whatever my bank balance). So\nthe solution is to make sure you keep\nspending but only the money you actually have. It seems I am asking rather\na lot of you especially after Britain has\nbred a litter of borrowers hooked on\nloans before they have left the womb.\nI am in a very easy, comfortable position to look with disdain upon the hype\nof our present economic situation. I\ndon\u2019t own any credit cards and so am\nonly able to spend money I actually\nhave. Whilst enjoying a particularly\noverpriced cocktail distinctly lacking\nin alcohol on the King\u2019s Road with a\nfriend, a middle-aged man of banking\nprofession sat at the table next to us \u2013\n\u201cNo shopping today, Ladies?\u201d \u2013 clearly\nfrazzled and anxious at the prospect of\nthings to come. A double whiskey was\nordered swiftly and I felt his frustration as they fluffed his order. This time\nmust be stroke-inducing for those at\nthe helm of our banks and markets,\ntheir heart rates rising as stocks and\nshares plummet: not to mention their\nChristmas bonuses.\nWhatever the events and the future,\nI think the Media needs to desist in the\nincessant coverage of this subject until\nwhen we actually need to worry.\nRampage of idealism\nGilead Amit\nT\nhe hubbub surrounding the fashionista sluts\nin Hangman a few weeks\nbackwasquiteasurpriseto\nme when I picked up Felix\nlast week. Despite living with women\nin the vicinity, I\u2019d had no idea that the\npiece had caused offence, as I\u2019d taken it\nas more of a mockery of male attitudes\nrather than women. Having said that, I\nthink some of my female friends did try\nto tell me something, it was just hard\nto hear them with the hoover going\nand the door to the kitchen shut all the\ntime. I\u2019m sure it was nothing.\nWhat surprised me, you see, is that\nsomeone had an emotional response\nto something they read in the press.\nI\u2019d taken it as read that we just ignored\nwhat people wrote in newspapers and\nthe like nowadays. Why else would I\nwrite this column. The only time I\u2019ve\nfelt moved by a newspaper headline\nwas when I was told that Jade Goody\nhad a fifty-fifty chance of survival, and\nthat was because the one thing you\nexpect to be able to depend on in this\nworld \u2013 terminal illness \u2013 had managed to fail on me spectacularly. So in\ngeneral the press only are there to offer me crosswords, comedy-sized photographs I can annotate with various\ngenitalia sketches, and the occasional\nFREE! soundtrack from a movie I\u2019ve\nnever heard of, usually starring Alec\nGuinness.\nI think a real contributing factor\nhere is that most people who write\nfor newspapers are exactly the kind of\npeople whose opinion you don\u2019t want\nto hear. To be a journalist you need,\nbroadly, two key attributes: the ability\nto generate what\u2019s called \u2018filler\u2019 \u2013 mindless chatter to boost word counts, also\nknown as \u2018articles\u2019 if you work for The\nMetro \u2013 and the ability to manipulate\ntext. Ninety-five percent of journalists go into an interview with someone\nknowing exactly what they want when\nthey leave. Unsurprisingly, they always\nmanage to get it, and that\u2019s by twisting,\nshearing and mushing up the words\nuntil they spell out the right phrase. It\u2019s\nlike playing Scrabble with the Cookie\nMonster.\nThese two things combine to form\nthis horrific concoction of hypocrisy,\nsensationalism and general ranting,\nand I\u2019ve not found a single paper that\nisn\u2019t susceptible to it. Everything from\nthe FT to felix has writers who are willing to bullshit their way through eight\nhundred words, and crowbar events\ninto a moral-of-the-story cookie cutter.\nAnd when it\u2019s Jade Goody being crow-barred and bullshitted, why should I\ncare? Frankly, I\u2019d like it if the crowbar\nwas actually made of bullshit. But it\npermeates everywhere, and everyone\nseems to think they\u2019re the ones who\nread the \u2018right\u2019 version of events.\nIt\u2019s tiresome, because the people who\nreally shouldn\u2019t be acting like arseholes\nend up gibbering and flailing copies of\nThe Independent at you, screaming\nbloody murder and conspiracy theo-ries. I\u2019m surprised you morons aren\u2019t\nup in arms about this because the majority of the press is taking the piss out\nof you on a regular basis.\nTheLondonPaper\u2019s attempt at \u2018understanding\u2019 LOLcats last week was a\ngood example of this, with the journalistic equivalent of your parents discussing rap music making up a beautiful\none-page feature on the \u2018phenomenon\u2019\nthat has \u2018millions hooked\u2019. LOLcats is\na firm favourite in the Felix offices, of\ncourse, but trying to understand and\nconcoct a page\u2019s worth of something\nthat you probably only heard about the\nday you were commissioned to write\nabout it results in the kind of writing\nthat would only really entertain people\nthat had been dead for three to four\nhours already.\nWhen they chose to cover the\nswitch-on at the LHC \u2013 and I\u2019ve been\nunable to find anyone that can debunk\nrumours that the BBC actually asked\nfor a big red button to be installed for\ntheir news coverage \u2013 one paper actually printed a photo of a computer\nscreen with a graph on it, and annotated it with a caption saying \u201cIS THIS\nA BLACK HOLE?\u201d.\nNo, it\u2019s a fucking peak on a line\ngraph. It\u2019s probably the power consumption of their air control system as\na thousand idiotic journalists suddenly\nstarted sweating at absolutely fuck all\nhappening where they\u2019d promised their\nlive viewers apocalypse and cries of\nEureka.\nIt\u2019s just gut-wrenchingly sad more\nthan anything, maybe particularly so\nfor anyone who\u2019s ever had a hope of\nwriting as a living in the future. Because the sad truth is that once you\nhit freelance work you\u2019ll slowly realise\nthat to make any money, you\u2019ll need to\nthrow away notions of changing things\nforever in favour of, well, going along\nwith everyone else.\nAnd that doesn\u2019t justify anything\nthat\u2019s out there. I\u2019m not even saying\nthat Hangman\u2019s opening misogyny\nspectacular was the sort of thing you\u2019d\nexpect to see in your average national\npublication. But we\u2019re not a national\npublication. We\u2019re a student paper.\nAnd it\u2019s our comedy pull-out section.\nAnd it\u2019s got a photo of the Oxford rector with lasers coming out of his eyes.\nAnd to be quite frank, if you\u2019re still\ninto taking things like that seriously\nthen subscribe to The Daily Mail, get\nthe cardboard out, and start writing a\nstiff letter on it to anangrygeek@goog-lemail.com.\nT\nhere must be a word to\ndescribe the combination\nof phobias that I have. I\nwould imagine some hideous Greco-Latin monstrosity with an indecent number of\nprefixes. I\u2019m not in the mood to start\nscouring www.phobialist.com at the\nmoment but I have no doubt that it\nwould furnish me with the answer. To\ntell the truth, now that I come to think\nabout it it\u2019s probably something quite\nshort and pithy, because what I have is\nby no means unusual. Just pathetic.\nThe truth is that I\u2019m afraid of change.\nI abhor any alteration to the routines\nI\u2019ve laid down for myself. I am the fud-diest of duddies and the muddiest of\nsticks. For a stinking wreck of neuro-ses, though, I can still coin the occasional euphonious phrase.\nI\u2019m sorry \u2013 this is misleading. It\nsounds as though I\u2019m either going to\nrelate some amusing anecdotes about\nmy aversion to change or provide you\nwith a fool-proof guide to emotional\nstability and mental openness. I\u2019m\nafraid I can\u2019t do either. My own psyche\nis still a construction site, and far be it\nfor the man with builders in the attic\nto give out DIY tips with any degree of\nconfidence.\nThere is, however, one remarkable\nproduct that can be acquired safely\nand legally and is guaranteed to help.\nIt\u2019s been around for a while, but the\nmodern-day ultra-refined version has\nlost none of its power. I\u2019m talking about\nHumour. It\u2019s a phenomenal concept\nwith a fascinating history and incred-ible, almost instantaneous results.\nIt is no coincidence that we humans\nsimultaneously have a sense of humour\nand an (albeit superficial) understanding of the Universe: the two unquestionably go hand-in-hand. The Universe is an inherently ridiculous place:\nI don\u2019t need to quote Douglas Adams\nat you to make my point. The more\ncomplete our awareness of our mind-boggling insignificance, the more ridiculous our existence seems. This is\nenough to drive some to despair, others to madness, others still to religion,\nsome to science, some to philosophy\nand a large proportion of all of the\nabove to humour.\nI am a great uplifter-onto-pedestals.\nI am also unusually fond of hyphena-tion, but that\u2019s a different issue. For me,\ncomedy is on a par with science and art.\nNot a subdivision of either but equal\nto both. The Universe is a mysterious,\nterrifying, incomprehensible and the-saurus-burstingly vast place for things\nas insignificant as us to find ourselves\nin. We are grossly underequipped to\ndealing with it, but we\u2019re doing pretty\nwell for the grandchildren of apes.\nOur genuine attempts to fill in the\nblack hole-like gaps in our knowledge\ntake the form of scientific investigation and artistic expression. The quest\nto find the logical order behind why\nexternal reactions and behaviours are\nas they are, and the equally insatiable\nneed to find the order behind our internal reactions and behaviours. Many\nless talented or original souls attempt\nto garner some understanding from religion \u2013 wasting their time on lazy and\nstultifying acts of self-deception and\ntruly futile re-interpretations of the\noriginal work of others.\nBut comedy ranks up there with both\nscience and art. It came as a relief to me\nearlier this week to discover that the\nAncient Greeks had a muse of comedy,\nas well as the more well-known muses\nof history, tragedy, dance and astrono-my. Their priorities, as ever, were spot\non. Because it literally is vitally important to find things funny. Take away\na sense of humour and you remove\na sense of perspective. Funny things\nmight not necessarily be less evil or\nunpleasant than unfunny ones, but at\nleast we feel that we understand them.\nThe ability to summarize a situation\nin a joke or an amusing cartoon effectively neutralizes it, strapping it to the\noperating table where you can examine\nit without fear. Laughing at something\nmeans you can tell where its limits are;\nthat you can see the places where it\nborders on the ridiculous. That gives\nus the feeling of certainty and control\nwe desperately need.\nLifeissomind-bogglinglyabsurdthat\nall you can really do about it is laugh.\nThe more nervous and uncertain you\nare, the more hilarious everything be-comes. Hence the fine line between a\nbaby\u2019s tears and giggles, the frenzied\nsex jokes that plague high school sex\ned teachers the world over, and the\nobsession with paedophilia, death,\nsexual fetishes and genocide that characterises the humour of young adults.\nThese last few are the things that scare\nus most. We are too old to lock the\nbogeymen in the closet and pretend\nthey don\u2019t exist, but also too young, in\nmany cases, to have experienced them\ndirectly. We float in a pristine pool that\nwe are desperate to prove is as muddied as anything that surrounds us.\nI am tremendously lenient when it\ncomes to borderline jokes because I\nknow and share the motivating force\nbehind them: our attempts to make\nsome sort of sense of the randomness\nof existence, to categorize and explicitly describe the things we are too\nscared or uncomfortable to directly\nconfront. There will always be idiots\nwith no sense of comic timing, cretins who have no idea what audience\nis appropiate for what sort of joke, and\nbigots who genuinely find racey jokes\nfunny for the wrong reasons. Ignore\nthem. Examine the context. The world\nof comedy should not have heavily-po-liced borders, but rather well-defined\nceasefire lines we recognize and get\ngiddy thrills from treading.\nWe\u2019re scared. We\u2019re alone. There is\nevil out there as well as genuine apa-thy, which is infinitely more frighten-ing. Humour is what allows us to get\nthrough unspeakable trauma and face\nup to our own inevitable brutality and\ndecay. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all we\nhave.\nA votive offering to Thalia\nL\nast issue felix asked us to debate the rights and wrongs\nof the case of Palestinian\nstudent Zohair Abu-Shaban\nand the denial of his passage\nthrough either Israel or Egypt by the\nIsraeli administration to allow him to\nattend his MSc at Imperial this year.\nHowever, I am sure that most people\nwould be of the opinion that no debate\nis needed at all. This is a gross violation of the rights of an aspiring, award-winning student and the only thing we\nneed to talk about is what, if anything,\nwe can do.\nIreally,trulyhopethatstudentsatImperial are aware of the absolute squalor\nthat is the Gaza strip and the horrendous life the people have to endure in\nthe Palestinian / Occupied territories\n\u2013 and if you don\u2019t, you are an ignorant\nloser. If there is anything that can promote peace or some improvement in\nthe region then it is not building walls\nand segregating the indigenous com-munities, but instead education and\ngestures of good-will. What possible\nbenefit the Israeli administration sees\nin stealing aspirations from positively\nmotivated individuals, I just do not\nknow. Conversely, what I do know is\nthe usual apathetic response we can\nexpect from the relevant embassies\nand offices. I would love to see what\nthey say if one of their own children\nwas stopped dead in his or her educational tracks. Somehow, I don\u2019t think\npaltry excuses about \u201chostile governments\u201d would hold\u2026\nI do not think it is unreasonable for\nus to ask the College and the Union\nto take this matter seriously, and I am\nsure things are being done, but I would\nlike to see the student body at Imperial\nbeing kept aware through regular com-munication. Plus, I also think there is\na good case for students at Imperial to\nrally together and get an active campaign and petition going that can include people from all walks of life and\npolitical persuasions. Since this case\nhas already received attention in the\nnational media, it is possible to have a\nsignificant impact.\nThere was another case in the past\nwhen a Palestinian student called\nKhaled was denied the opportunity\nto pursue a better life through similar\nrestrictions but thankfully British students were able to organise a campaign\nlarge enough to counter this. Now that\nKhaled is in Britain and has started a\nnational organisation that we can also\nturn to for support (www.letpalstudy.\norg.uk), I feel optimistic that together\nwe can do the same again.\nThe plight of Zohair\nAmmar\nWaraich\nI\nt has all gone so very wrong. The\neconomy crumbles! Inflation\nsoars! The weather is colder! Oh,\nit is you. I am ever so sorry, I did\nnot realise that you were here.\nYour term has started? How important!\nHow note-worthy! The ramifications\nwill ripple across the Universe, ending\nstars, destroying galaxies and threatening the very fabric of existence itself!\nA million people tremble at the\nsound of the faintest remnants of the\nechoes of your footsteps! You are the\nrocks of the eternal shore; all that\ncrashes against you is broken! Neither\nPerdition\u2019s Flame nor Heaven\u2019s Light\ncould enlighten that which was in your\nshadow. Your name is Ozymandias,\nKing of Kings: Look on your works, ye\nMighty, and despair!\nOzymandias, indeed. You are at Imperial now where all your accomplishments are as the monuments of the\nPharaohs: buried beneath the desert\nsands. Your worth here can be measured and weighed, and any calibrated\nscale will tell you that your value is exactly equal to the cost of your tuition\nfees.\nTo think, people lose their jobs and\nhomes because you are forcing the\nGovernment to spend all its money\nprovide you with an extremely generous loan. You monster! You heartless\ncreature of the abyss! Do the screams\nof the children you, and you alone, are\ncausing to starve bring you joy? Are\nyour emotions so warped and twisted\nthat making trillions upon trillions of\npeople suffer is the only way that you\nmight feel a flicker of long-forgotten\njoy?\nIt was debt that caused the economy\nto revert to the club-to-the-face-your-stuff-now-mine economic model employed by our cave-dwelling ancestors,\nin the age before Adam Smith wrote\nhis magnum opus, \u2018Why It Is Right\nand Proper That Poor People Ought\nto Starve and That Banks Should Lend\nMore Money Than Exists Because\nKeynesian Economics Will Have Been\nInvented By The Time It Becomes An\nIssue\u2019 (they were fond of long titles in\nhis day).\nWhere was I? Ah yes, hello, welcome\nand all that. If you are a returning student I hope the wretched stupidity that\nis affirmative action towards peasants\nhas not blighted your test scores. My\nfather endowed the College with a\nchair and yet my exams were still graded based upon my performance, like a\ncommoner! How is it fair that I must\nendure such a handicap? Since when\ndid money cease to make me superior\nto others?\nIn any just society I would have been\nawarded a PhD there and then. They\nwon\u2019t even give the money back so I\ncannot cheer myself up by having people thrown in rivers by ninja-butlers.\nViscount\nKensington\nIt\u2019s all gone wrong\nThe muses. Thalia, second from the left, is the muse of comedy and bucolic poetry. Just a bit of context.\n\u201c\nWe\u2019re\nscared. We\u2019re\nalone. There is\nevil out there as\nwell as genuine\napathy, which is\ninfinitely more\nfrightening.\n\u201d\n\n"

Some of\nyou will be in your intermediate years\nhere, while others will be in your final\nyear, preparing to leave College. Whatever point you\u2019re at in your university\ncareer, the experience of transition is\nlikely to affect you in some way.\nIf you\u2019re in your first term of undergraduate study, this might be the first\ntime you\u2019ve been away from home for a\nlong period, the first time you\u2019ve been\naway from your family and friends for\nan extended period. You\u2019re likely to feel\na little homesick. This is natural, a sign\nthat you\u2019re human and have attachments to people.\nPerhaps you have arrived at College\nfrom another country; you might be\nunfamiliar with Britain and British cul-tures. English might not be your first\nlanguage. And although you can keep\ncontact with your loved ones by phone\nor email, it\u2019s not the same as face-to-face contact.\nYou might have arrived in the centre\nofLondonfromamuchsmallertownor\nvillage setting, in which case you could\nfeel somewhat overwhelmed by living\nin the city. And on top of all that, this\nmight be the first time you have to do\nyour own washing, or to shop for your\nown food. Moreover, for some people,\nmeeting new friends and socialising\ncan evoke considerable anxiety. All of\nthis is in addition to the demanding\ncourses studied at Imperial!\nOf course, all of these transitions are\nlikely to be exciting as well as challenging and offer opportunities for you to\nexperience new situations and cultures.\nYet, at the same time, new situations\noften feel daunting as well as exciting.\nThey are likely to highlight the areas in\nwhich we feel unsure about ourselves.\nEveryone might feel uncomfortable in\na new situation, as well as excited.\nPerhaps you\u2019re in the final year of\nyour undergraduate career, and considering job applications as well as\nfinals. Next summer you\u2019ll be leaving\nCollege and beginning the next phase\nof your life, with different challenges\nand opportunities. Are you achieving\nwhat you wanted to achieve at College? Everyone has regrets, but is there\nanything in particular that you\u2019d like to\nachieve before you leave?\nPerhaps you\u2019ve recently begun an\nMSc, or a PhD. The volume of work\ninvolved in an MSc at Imperial is large,\nperhaps considerably more than was\ninvolved in your undergraduate degree.\nAnd if you\u2019re beginning a PhD you will\nbe faced with the task of organising\nyour unstructured time in a way that\nwas not required for an undergraduate\ndegree. Hence the transition to postgraduate study has its own particular\nchallenges.\nYou might be returning to academic\nstudy after a period of working: that\ncould be a shock to the system in itself.\nYou might also have commitments you\ndidn\u2019t have as an undergraduate \u2013 a\npartner, children, a mortgage \u2013 different challenges involved in a different\nlife-stage.\nIn short, no matter what stage you\u2019re\nat in your time at College, there are\nchallenges and opportunities which\nare concerned with transition and\nchange. If you\u2019re struggling with these,\nit might be helpful to talk about them,\nin order to clarify and understand your\nexperience. Sometimes it\u2019s helpful to\ntalk with someone completely outside\nyour circle of friends and family.\nYou could talk with your personal tutor or member of your hall wardening\nteam, in the first instance. In addition,\nthe Student Counselling Service is\navailable to any registered student\nwho would like to talk about any of\nthese challenges. Information about\nthe service is at www.imperial.ac.uk/\ncounselling. To arrange an initial ap-pointment, contact reception at coun-selling@imperial.ac.uk or on 020\n7594 9637.\nThe doctors at Imperial College\nHealth Centre have a great deal of experience and knowledge of students\u2019\npsychological health. They are available for you to arrange an appointment\nto talk with them. There are also counsellors and psychotherapists in the\nHealth Centre who can be consulted\nafter referral via a doctor or practice\nnurse.\nTimes of transition and change may\npresent us with new experiences that\nchallenge or clash with aspects of our\ndeeply held ideas or beliefs: In this\ninternational community we are presented with a wide range of faiths, beliefs and intellectual traditions. This\ncan be both exciting and bewildering.\nThe Chaplaincy is available to anyone\n\u2013 from any faith or world view \u2013 who\nwants to reflect on these kind of ques-tions. Chaplains can also suggest other\nplaces to help you explore your ideas\nfurther or to enter into dialogue with\ndifferent view points. Further information about the Chaplaincy Centre is at\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/chaplaincy\nIf you identify strongly with any of\nthe areas described here, don\u2019t wait\nuntil your unhappiness grows and gets\nin the way of you enjoying life here at\nCollege; talk with someone soon so\nproblems can be explored before they\nbecome a major issue.\nThe International Office is running\na series of orientation workshops for\ninternational students. One of these\nis \u2018Adjusting To Student Life in London\u2019 which will be run in collaboration\nwith the Student Counselling Service.\nThis will take place on Monday 20th\nOctober, 13:00 \u2013 14:00. For further\ninformation visit www.imperial.\nac.uk/international or contact Imperial College International Office at\ninternational@imperial.ac.uk or telephone 0207 594 8040.\nA guide to surviving your first term\nThe beginning of term can be an anxious and confusing time for many students. Fear not, help is at hand:\nUganda has been one of the biggest success stories in Africa's fight against\nHIV and AIDS. At its peak, it was estimated that 15% of the population was\nliving with HIV or AIDS, a percentage which has fallen dramatically to about\n5% today. People tend to disagree on the reasons for their success but con-troversially, part of the success seems to lie with the government's ABC cam-paign, which focuses primarily on the message of abstinence.\nMartin Ssempa, a pastor in Uganda, is coming to Imperial to argue why\nhe believes abstinence could be the key to success in the fight against the\ndisease which affects 33 million people worldwide. Whether you agree or\nstrongly disagree come along to hear his views, air yours and get involved in\nthe debate!\nThis event has been organised as a S.H.A.G. Taster event, the Union's\ncampaign to promote sexual health awareness. S.H.A.G. Week will be taking\nplace in from the 24th to 28th of November right across campus and we are\nactively recruiting S.H.A.G. Ambassadors now to help spread the message\nabout sexual health and distribute their weight in condoms! If you\u2019re interested email dpew@imperial.ac.uk saying you\u2019d like to get involved.\nDavid Allmann\nStudent Counsellor\nSome students feel a little lost when they first come to university\nUganda: The HIV Success story?\nUganda: The HIV success story?

Mazeltov. Nice to see you\u2019ve\ngot back into the old habit\nof picking up your weekly\nfelix, laughing hysterically at the dia-phragm-punishing commentary, then\nthrowing your copy into the wind until\nsome poor unsuspecting Fresher gets\nhit in the face by it. He picks it up, and\nthe cycle continues.\nIt unnervingly feels like I hadn\u2019t\nsuffered from three mind-numbing\nmonths of London suburbia over the\nsummer. No emotional goodbyes this\ntime around, just absences, one by one,\nfrom our table at the local pub. When\nI found myself sitting in the Moon Under Water in Watford alone, I knew it\nwas time to return my sweaty backside\nto Imperial.\nUnprofessional as this will sound,\nI\u2019ve been completely out of the loop of\nanything current. Including news, and\nmore than likely, fashion. The Internet\nhas its wonderfully life-filling hands\ntightly positioned around me. For the\npast couple of weeks, no Internet has\nmeant that my life has been a bland\nblob of ignorance. Hence, I apologise if\nmy section for this week reads like \u2018The\nOrigin of Species\u2019; outdated, boring\ntrundle that everyone already knows.\nBut then some say \u2018The Origin of Species\u2019 was revolutionary. But then some\npeople at the time thought Charles\nDarwin was the devil and wanted his\nfinch-loving head on a pike.\nI\u2019m talking about Charles Darwin\nin the Fashion section. What is wrong\nwith me? What\u2019s wrong with you? Why\nare you still reading, fool? I wouldn\u2019t\nbe. In fact, I\u2019m not, and I\u2019m still typing.\nYou know what? I pitty the fool. And\nyes, with a double \u2018t\u2019. Half-heartedly\npoint that spelling error out.\nfelix has taken some flak these last\ncouple of weeks. Granted, we have not\nhit the ground running this year. I don\u2019t\nthink felix ever does, mainly down to\nthe fact that half of last year\u2019s editorial\nteam have graduated and crawled out\ninto the big bad world of work, what\nI affectionately refer to as the getting-cucumbers-and-other-such-sizeable-vegetables-shoved-in-my-arse period\nof my life.\nWe are a student newspaper, not the\nGuardian, not The Daily Star, but felix.\nOur readers are the students of Imperial, and to have such a large readership\nof thousands in such close community\nis rare. We embrace that by referencing\nto the comic value and trends only you\nlot will truly understand; namely the\nsex ratio. The fact that a bloke is Fashion Editor probably proves that point.\nSo lighten up. It\u2019s all in jest, and enjoy\nthe paper for what it is.\nI\u2019ve already had to omit Fashion from\nthe last issue due to lack of time and\ncontributions. To stop such travesties\nreoccurring, come write for felix Fashion. Write your opinions on the latest\ntrend, a review of your mum\u2019s ward-robe. My point is: anything (related\nto Fashion), and email me at fashion.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk. You never know,\nyour mum might disown you for claiming she always looking dowdy, and then\nall you\u2019ve got is felix for that motherly(-esque) bosom you blatantly crave.\nFashion-spotting on campus\nNada Jumabhoy roams Imperial College for its best dressed students this week\nT\nhe felix Fashion team\nsent out a team of all-tutting, all-scrutinising\nfashionistas to find the\nbest-dressed students\nof Imperial College.\nThere is always an element of chance\ninvolved. Not everyone is going to look\ntheir best everyday, and not everyone looks harmless, lost and innocent\nenough for us to pounce on.\nWe targeted Freshers, but tried not\nto ignore the upper years. Sadly, we\u2019ve\nmissed the very first week or two when\nall the Freshers dress up in their best\noutfits every day, even to go to a five\nminute meeting with their crusty and\nbearded personal tutor.

The team especially took\nto Hoon\u2019s faux fur trimmed top from\nZara. It was the first thing we noticed\nabout him as he sat in the Union have a\npre-lecture pint.\nWe also asked them what they\nthought of the fashion and style of their\nfellow students at College.

We were wondering why, but\nit was obvious a lot of Freshers didn\u2019t\nthink too highly of the hoody and jeans\nculture that sitting in a computer lab\nall day harbours.\nBeing simply and comfortably\ndressed does not mean you have to\nlook too ragged though. Ez, who we\nfound chatting to his friends on the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn, was simply wearing a\npolo T-shirt and jeans. It was nothing\noutstanding, but that\u2019s exactly what we\nloved about it. The solid blue and black\ntheme worked really well for him, finished off stylishly with a rather volu-mised kaftan scarf around his neck.\nAnjali, a second year Bioengineer\nwas hanging out by the SAF, and she\nepitomised the aforementioned comfortable and stylish combination well.\nHer outfit was a combination of her\nown stuff and her boyfriend\u2019s. The\noversized rugby shirt and belt formed\na sweet dress with a lot of character.\nSince Imperial is such a culturally diverse place, we decided to feature Vic\nMan, due to his love of Korean cloth-ing. He was wearing a monochrome\ncasual tuxedo and jeans outfit, with an\nunderlay of vivid scarlet provided by\nhis cardigan.\nTo all those that have been featured:\nsmile, you\u2019re now famous. For a week\nat least. To those that aren\u2019t, but your\nbest kit on, you\u2019ll never know when\nwe\u2019ll be roaming again.\n\n"

IC had\ndecided that Essex had enough goals\nand should now be put into their place\n- the whipping boys of the league!\nAfter some tactical adjustments and\nencouragements from Lord Byron,\nIC quickly struck back with two goals\nfrom Stumpy and Sash. Sexy Sash (as\nhe is more well known) continued to\ninterlink with fresher Koch culminating in some elegant moves. Half time\narrived and it was all level at two a\npiece, where Lord Byron delivered\nhis commandments. The second half\nkicked off with fresher Prior opening\nthe floodgates for IC. Whatever captain\nDR put in the jaffa-cakes at half time\nclearly worked with goals from Diana\neffectively wrapping up the win inside\nthe first ten minutes. It was at this time\nLord Byron unleashed Sid and Paedo\nfrom the bench... Stumpy had other\nideas however! Being a bit of an Essex\nboy himself he decided to take pity on\nthe opposition and proceeded to miss\ntwo open goals. Diana was less forgiving and completed his hat-trick. Eleven\ngoals in a row had secured victory for\nIC, although in the bar afterwards Essex demolished ET et al. in a poorly\nrun boat race.

This fixture has been incredibly close for the last three seasons\nwith IC edging it every time so both\nsides were fired up for a great start to\nthe season.\nThere was no departure from the\nexpectation in the first quarter, the\nmatch being closely fought with end\nto end with episodes of good play. Despite IC leading 3-1, by the end of the\nquarter the medics had managed to\nclaw it back to go ahead 4-3.\nIn the second quarter the medics\nfound their stride and comfortably ex-Netball\nImperial 2nd 10\nICSM 3rd\t\t 15\ntended their lead. The impenetrable\ndefence of GK Colleen McGregor and\nthe partnership between Kate Wooding and Emma Suttill at the other end\nfrustrated IC and kept the goals com-ing. Half time came at a low point with\nan IC injury, but the score 9-6 to the\nmedics.\nFatigue was evident in both teams in\nthe second half but the medics capitalised on the strength in depth of their\nnew squad to continue fighting and\nstretched their lead to 8 goals with only\na quarter remaining. In the last ten\nminutes, under the threat of the floodlights being turned off, IC led a spirited\nresurgence, leaving the score 15-10 to\nthe medics at the final whistle.\nCredit goes to both teams for excellent play with the ULU season coming\nso soon after the start of term. Freshers Sarah Hancox and Feroza Kassam\nplayed particularly well in their first\nmatch for and the rest of the club are\nlooking forward to celebrating a clean\nsweep of first game victories with them\nin the Reynolds on Wednesday night!\nOn a wet and windy day at home ICURFC 2nd\u2019s played their first match of the\nseason against St Barts 1st\u2019s (Medic\nScum). The first ten minutes was all IC\nwith our forwards working it tight with\ntheir muster and the backs hitting their\nlines when they had the ball. All the\nscum could do was watch and stare,\nand drop the ball every 5 seconds. This\npressure led IC to gain a penalty inside\nthe 22, which Scott Greening converted to give IC an early lead. James Morrison left the pitch at this point complaining it was too tough at prop and\nwas replaced by Andy Dolan.\nThe scum started bossing the scrum\nas the ref was blind to their cheating\non the front and they worked their one\nICURFC take on medic scum\nmove of giving it to the fatter members to bosh it forward. But IC stayed\nstrong. After about fifteen minutes of\nsustained pressure on our own line,\nand some gentle shoeing by Fresher\nDave and Niall, the scum crashed over\nfor their first unconverted try.\nThen came the move of the match.\nAfter a long clearance by Scott in which\nthe scum\u2019s full back failed to catch and\nknocked out for a line out, Scott had\nthe presence of mind and knowledge of\nthe new rules to take a quick line out\nto Fresher Dave, get the ball back and\nscore our first try of the season. The\nscum scored again to leave the rain\nsoaked matched locked at 8-10.\nIC started the second half with\nFresher Rob nailing their fullback as he\nwas kicking for touch. The full-blood-ed tackles kept flying from every member of the team. Five minutes into the\nsecond half our replacements came on\nand after two minuets and one tackle\nFresher Simon left after his cameo.\nAfter IC defend their line with massive hits we caught them on the break.\nWith a kick through, Scott, Fresher\nDave and Fresher Ginger-guy chased\ndown the scum\u2019s full back and true to\nform he fucked up again which lead to\nScott crashing over.\nIC then had to defend their line with\nthe score at 13-10 and held strong for\n20 minutes. Unfortunately the scum\ncrashed over to go up 15-13. After this\nJoe Mac got cramp and screamed like\na little girl so the final fresher came\non. In the last fifteen minutes IC kept\nturning the ball over but couldn\u2019t find a\nway through with Scott missing a penalty near the end of the match.\nIC 2nd\u2019s can be proud seeing that the\nprevious week the scum had won 69-0\nand we are confident that we can hold\nour own in this league. Andy Mac had\na great first match in charge with the\nsupport of Malcolm.

UCL\nwere keen to get under way with epee,\nto allow one of their fencers to attend\nafternoon lectures while Imperial\u2019s key\nepeeist Sjoerd Miedema was stuck in\ntraffic. Imperial received a lucky break\nas first Sabre, then Epee and finally Foil\nwere randomly drawn.\nCharlie Hennings made his experience count in the opening match, effortlessly dispatching his opponent\n5-2. Team captain Maurice Berk subsequently found himself on the very\nwrong end of a 4-8 loss and Imperial continued to drop points as Chris\nNamih lost his first match 3-5. Matters\ncontinued to worsen as Maurice failed\nto redeem himself in his second match,\nlosing 3-5 before Charlie romped to a\n10-2 victory. Chris went close with a\n5-6 loss in his second match to leave\nthe score 30-28 in Imperial\u2019s favour\nbefore the final round. Maurice finally found his stride with a 5-3 victory,\nquickly followed by Chris\u2019s 5-4 win.\nCharlie brushed aside his final opponent 5-2, leaving Imperial 45-37 in the\nlead going in to epee.\nSjoerd Miedema, was nominated anchor for epee and despite reportedly\nsuffering from tuberculosis, produced\na fine 5-3 win in his opening match.\nFresher Chris Jackson also produced\nan excellent debut display to win his\nFencers On Target\nMaurice Berk\nfirst match 5-2 before Tim HarfordCross made it 3 out of 3 with a 5-3\nvictory. Chris could only manage a 5-5\ndraw in his second match and Sjoerd\nfared no better, going down to a 5-8\ndefeat, a sure sign of the disease ravaging his body. Tim got Imperial back\nto winning ways with a 5-4 win but the\nelation was short lived as UCL surged\nto the finish in the final three matches,\nwinning 4-10, 3-5 and 3-5. This left\nUCL with a close fought victory in\nepee, final scores standing at 40-45 and\nleaving Imperial with a slender 3 point\nlead with just foil to play for.\nClub president Chris Namih, clearly\nback in his element after his rare foray\nin to sabre, stormed to a 5-1 victory in\nthe opening foil match. Nathan \u201cBadger\u201d Harmston experienced a mauling\nby UCL\u2019s captain, limping his way to a\n5-8 defeat and setting the nerves rac-ing. Fortunately 2nd team veteran Alex\nBishop restored faith with a solid 5-2\nwin before Badger made amends, winning his second match 5-4. Chris continued to run rampant, demolishing\nhis second opponent 5-1 before it was\nAlex\u2019s turn to find himself on the end\nof a brutal battering courtesy of UCL\u2019s\ncaptain, eventually finding his way to\na 5 \u2013 11 defeat. Badger, clearly feeling\nthe effects of physical exertion, made\nway for substitute and omnipresent\n2nd team fixture Nathan Blundell who\nmade a strong case for a place in the\nstarting lineup for the next match with\na 5-0 win. Alex continued to struggle\nagainst his final opponent, losing 5-9\nand leaving the scores 125-117 in Imperial\u2019s favor before the final match.\nWith a potential 10 points up for grabs\nfor UCL, Chris needed to ensure he\nmade the most of his years of fencing\nexperience to prevent the UCL captain\nfrom almost single-handedly winning\nthem the match. Chris overcame his\nopponent 5-3 in a fine display that finally settled Imperial\u2019s nerves, final\nscore standing at 130 \u2013 120.\nWednesday night sees the start of\nbaseball\u2019s 104th World Series, a best-of-seven playoff that will pit the winner of the American League Championship Series, currently taking place\nbetween the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston Red Sox, against the winner of the\nNational League Championship Series,\nfeaturing the Philadelphia Phillies and\nLos Angeles Dodgers.

Once the\ngall bladder was examined, it was realised that it needed to be removed\nanyway. A spokeswoman told the Telegraph that: \u201cDuring the operation, the\npatient was found to need this treatment which was successfully carried\nout.\u201d\n\u201cThe patient made a good recovery\nand her original problem was resolved.\nThe trust has apologised to both the\npatient and their family who have now\nreturned home.\u201d\nThe main concern raised here is\nthat there could have been such a\nmistake. With each patient, there are\nseveral checks that are made to ensure\nthat such a mistake is not made. Such\nmeasures include giving each patient a\nwrist-band which has their name and a\nunique number that links them to the\nparticular treatment they may require.\nAs well as all these measures, the patient is made to sign a consent form for\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in chief\nThis hospital belongs to Mary., I want a hospital all of my own too\nMain Dinning Hall serving\nOriental buffet, for now\nAlice Rowlands\nNews Correspondent\nImperial fall to 6th,\nUCL climb to 7th\nDaniel Wan\nNews Correspondent\nAn updated Times Higher Education\n(THE) World University rankings for\n2008 were announced this week, which\nsaw Imperial drop one from last year\u2019s\n5th place. Imperial are only bettered by\nHarvard, Yale, Cambridge, Oxford and\nnow California Institute of Technology, who leapfrogged Imperial, moving\nup 3 places from 7th to this year\u2019s 4th.\nDespite controversy of 2007 rankings\nplacing the renown American university Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) below Imperial, MIT have\nremained so; albeit by a smaller margin of ranking for 2008. Many American universities disregard the Times\nHigher Education rankings in favour\nof Shanghai Jiao Tong University\u2019s ta-bles, which conveniently rank eight\nAmerican universities in their top ten.\nIn contrast to the THE rankings, Imperial are placed 27th, whilst MIT stand\nin a commanding 5th place.\nImperial scored perfect 100s in Staff/\nStudent, International Students, and\nEmployer Review scores, and averaged at 98.4, 0.2 points behind 5th\nplace. The Times Higher Education revamped their ranking methodology in\n2007, with Imperial taking great strides\nup the tables due to the introduction of\ngraduate recruitment scoring.\nTop British universities have taken a\nfall as a whole, with both Cambridge\nand Oxford also slipping a single rank-ing. Bloomsbury-based UCL bucked\nthis trend and actually climbed 2 places to 7th; sniffing Imperial\u2019s figurative\nbackside one ranking behind.\nNope, we don\u2019t know how the scoring works either. Go figure.\nthe particular operation they may re-quire, which is accompanied with them\nto the operating theatre. The Trust has\nnot commented on wether or not any\nof those responsible had been sus-pended, however one senior surgeon at\nthe hospital told The Times this week\nthat \u201cHeads are bound to roll.\u201d\nSales in food from the Main Dining\nHall (MDH) have declined by 27% in\none year, so it may have escaped your\nnotice that the option of buying hot\nmeals has been replaced by a \u00a35 per\nhead \u2018all you can eat\u2019 \u2018oriental\u2019 buffet.\nUnfortunately, the term \u2018all you can\neat\u2019 should technically be replaced by\n\u2018all you can stack on your plate the first\ntime you go to the counter\u2019 and \u2018oriental\u2019 should be replaced by \u2018anywhere\nin Asia\u2019. As some students have put it,\nthis option doesn\u2019t compare favourably\nwith the Oriental Canteen in South\nKensington- Chinese food at about\n\u00a33.50 to \u00a34.00 for a main course, or the\nQueen\u2019s Arms- gastro-pub style of food\nwhich starts at around \u00a36 for a main\ncourse. The only other hot food on\ncampus, available to undergraduates,\nis in the Junior Common Room [JCR]\nand consists of soup, paninis, burgers\nor fried chicken. Several student have\nwritten into felix complaining that this\nis unsatisfactory, as there isn\u2019t a realis-tic, healthy alternative.\nJane Neary, head of catering and conferencing at Imperial, explained to felix\nthat as well as declining food sales, the\nhot counters used in the MDH were\nnot able to keep food hot enough to\nsatisfy health and safety regulations.\nJane Neary commented that \u201csomething drastic\u201d had to be done to tackle\nthe falling sales and health standards,\nwhich is why a buffet was chosen.\nThe option of opening an oriental\nbuffet on campus appealed because of\nthe high Asian population at Imperial.\nIt was also pointed out that the buffet\nis only a temporary solution until the\nproblems with the MDH can be re-solved. What is unclear to this reporter\nis why buffet chafing dishes are able\nto hold the heat better than the hot\ncounters.\nfelix had also received a review of\nthe food at the buffet, which included\ncomments about the poor quality and\npoor attempts to imitate oriental dish-es. One student even wrote in to say\nthat the MDH served \u201cslimy noodles,\nterrible egg-fried rice and deep-fried\nvegetables.\u201d\nThe oriental buffet will be reviewed\nat the end of the week (sales made in\nthe MDH during the first week were\ndisregarded due to the fact that it was\nFreshers\u2019 Week). However, if queues in\nthe JCR and DaVinci\u2019s are anything to\ngo by (note: food is also served in dB\u2019sno, I didn\u2019t know either!), sales of the\nnew buffet have been lower than the\nschool-dinner food of old and change\ncan be expected soon.\nIn comparison to the JCR, anyone\nlucky enough to be allowed into the\nSenior Common Room [SCR], will\nknow that College are capable of providing edible hot meals starting from\n\u00a34.25, as well as the option of choosing your own salad - a privilege that\nhas been taken away from the undergraduates in the JCR.\nTop: queue in daVinci\u2019s.

This comes at a time when Britain is already stepping up pressure for\na political and diplomatic resolution to\nthe conflict.\nBrigadier Mark Carleton-Smith said\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to win this war,\u201d .\n\u201cIt\u2019s about reducing it to a manageable\nlevel of insurgency that\u2019s not a strategic threat and can be managed by the\nAfghan army. We may well leave with\nthere still being a low but steady ebb of\nrural insurgency.\u201d\nCarleton-Smith, commander of 16th\nAir Assault Brigade, has just completed a six-month mission in southern\nAfghanistan during which 32 of his\nsoldiers were killed and 170 injured.\nCarleon-Smith remarked that his forces had \u201ctaken the sting out of the Taliban for 2008\u201d. However, he warned that\nthe public should not expect \u201ca decisive\nmilitary victory\u201d so it is necessary to\n\u201clower our expectations\u201d and accept it\nas unrealistic that multinational forces\ncan rid the country of armed militias.\nThe aim should be not to engage\nin an endless military assault but to\nchange the nature of the debate in Afghanistan so that disputes were settled\nby negotiation rather than violence.\nCarleton-Smith stating \u201cIf the Taliban\nwere prepared to sit on the other side\nof the table and talk about a political\nsettlement, then that\u2019s precisely the\nsort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this. That shouldn\u2019t make\npeople uncomfortable.\u201d\nAbdul Rahim Wardak, Afghanistan\u2019s\ndefence minister, expressed disappointment at the comments. However,\nCarleton-Smith\u2019s warning has been\nechoed by a senior defence source who\ntold The Guardian \u201cthe notion of winning and losing the decisive battle does\nnot exist.\u201d Carleton-Smith added that\nall the Nato-led international military\nforce could do in Afghanistan was provide the \u201cparameters of security.\u201d\nThese deepening concerns reflect\nwhat British defence chiefs are saying privately. The conflict with the\nTaliban has reached a \u201cstalemate\u201d they\nsay. There is also increased frustration\nwith the weakness and corruption of\nPresident Hamid Karzai\u2019s government\nin Kabul.\nThe French weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 reported that Sherard CowperColes, UK ambassador to Kabul, told\na French official that foreign troops\nadded to Afghanistan\u2019s problems. Reportedly, Cowper-Coles said the country might best be \u201cgoverned by an acceptable dictator\u201d, that the American\nUK Commander in Afghanistan, Mark Carleton-Smith, voices concern over the\ndirection of the war and advocates diplomacy.\nstrategy was \u201cdestined to fail\u201d and the\npresence of foreign troops was \u201cpart\nof the problem, not the solution.\u201d The\nFrench foreign ministry said the newspaper report did not \u201ccorrespond at\nall with what we hear from our British counterparts in our discussions on\nAfghanistan.\u201d Britain has denied that\nit believes the military campaign is\ndoomed to failure. Writing on his web-site, David Miliband, foreign secretary,\ndescribed the report as \u201cgarbled\u201d and\ninsisted that Britain did not support a\nKabul dictatorship.\nHe wrote \u201cThe future of Afghanistan\nis not about appointed dictators or foreign occupation, it is about building\nAfghan capabilities with the confidence of the Afghan people.\u201d\nA Foreign Office official was reported\nto have described the claim that Cowper-Coles advocated a dictatorship in\nKabul as \u201cutter nonsense\u201d and that the\ncomments that have been attributed to\nhim are a distortion of what was said.\nBritish officials are exasperated with\nthe Karzai administration, the slow\nbuild up of a national army and corruption in the Afghan police force.\nViolence in Afghanistan has risen\nto its worst level since 2001, when the\nUS led coalition overthrew the Taliban. However, since the invasion of\nIraq, Afghanistan has been left short of\ntroops and low on resources. The UK\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\ngeneral in Afghanistan has welcomed\nvarious attempts to bring this shortfall to light. In the recent Presidential\nDebate, Obama strongly advocated the\nexpansion of the efforts in Afghanistan\nwhile scaling back the military in Iraq.\nNeither the US nor UK can afford\nto fight in two wars at once; the strain\non the available resources is too great.\nMany officials believe that the war in\nIraq was misguided not only legally but\nalso due to the effect it has had on the\nfight against insurgency in Afghanistan, the main battleground against\nterrorism. What all on the ground believe is that if troops were pulled out of\nIraq, a country in disarray, they could\nbe put to much better use in Afghanistan to speed up the transition to complete Afghan control of the country.\nAid agencies say the Taliban and associated groups are controlling more\nterritory and it is increasingly difficult\nto provide the population with their\nhumanitarian needs, let alone physical\nsecurity. The increase in power of the\nTaliban and the unknown whereabouts\nof Bin Laden give more reasons to increase the coalition\u2019s power.\nAfter months of indecision and attacking western diplomats and military\nofficials for approaching Taliban forces\nto attempt a resolution, Karzai said last\nweek he had asked the king of Saudi\nArabia to mediate in negotiations.\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nMilitary tactics may soon give way to diplomacy as top UK officials call for change.\nG\nood morning/afternoon/\nevening!

It was in 1923, with the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne that\nbroadly outlined the borders of modern Turkey, that Kurdistan became\ndivided into four pieces in the newly\ncreated states of Iran, Iraq, Syria and\nTurkey. Many fail to understand that\nit was this random carving up of land\nthat separated Kurdish family trees,\nplaced the Kurds under various tyrannies that would rule over them for\ndecades and has been the root for the\ncontinued Kurdish struggle today for\nnationhood.\nRecent clashes between guerrillas of\nthe Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party (PKK)\nand the Turkish military near the\nKurdish town of Semdini left at least\n38 dead and dozens wounded, according to official Turkish military sources.\nThe event made international news\nheadlines. The fundamentals behind\nthis conflict involve an armed struggle that was launched in 1984 with the\naim of creating an independent Kurdish state in what is today southeastern\nTurkey. The Worker\u2019s Party has always\nclaimed that they did not initiate the\nfight, but that it was a direct response\nto the subjugation of Kurds in Turkey,\ntheir attempted assimilation and the\nlack of possibility for Kurds to get involved on the diplomatic stage in order to be heard. For example, Kurdish\ntowns and villages had been renamed\nto erase their Kurdish identity, the\nKurdish language had been forbidden to be spoken in public, Kurdish\nmovements (be they political, cultural\nor economic) had been banned and\nKurdish media outlets had not been allowed to operate. Until as recently as\n1991 the Kurds were not recognized by\nthe Turkish government as a distinct\nethnic people, but were rather referred\nto as \u201cmountain Turks\u201d, for they usually\nlive in the higher plateaus. The conflict\nturned into a human crisis in the early\n1990s when between 3,500 and 4,000\nKurdish villages were destroyed by the\nTurkish military (often being burned to\nthe ground) and around three million\nKurds were displaced to geographical\nentities in western Turkey with the\nattempt of cutting off supplies to the\nKurdish rebels.\nAfter the clash between the two\nsides a couple of weeks ago, the Turkish president and prime minister, both\nfrom the ruling AK Party, promised\nto step up the military effort in battling the Worker\u2019s Party. Turkey (itself\na NATO member), NATO, the majority of European countries and the\nU.S.A. consider the Worker\u2019s Party to\nbe a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d. However,\ntargeting mainly military and strategic targets, the Worker\u2019s Party has insisted on its legislative background as\na counter force to what they see as \u201cthe\nmilitarisation of Kurdish areas in Turkey\u201d. Ironically, the Worker\u2019s Party has\ndeployed the same tactics as the rebels\nled by George Washington in the\nRaz Jabary\nAmerican War of Independence, the\nsame as those deployed by the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the\nPatriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)\nin their fight against the brutality of\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s regime in Iraq. The\nlatter three examples of armed struggle are nowadays looked back upon as\nstruggles of liberation rather than the\nuse of terror against a superior force.\nUnlike the Kurds in Turkey, the\nKurds in Iraq have their own internationally recognized semi-independent\nstate with its own regional government\n(the Kurdistan Regional Government\nor KRG), presidency, constitution, security forces, flag and national anthem.\nKurds are fighting for sovereignty over the kurdish-inhabited area.\nHolding a substantial number of seats\nin the Iraqi Parliament and with close\nties with the West, the Kurds in Iraq\nare closer to Kurdish nationhood than\nthe Kurds in Turkey. The greater successes achieved by the Kurds in Iraq,\nin their realization of political aims,\nin comparison to the Kurds in Turkey\ncan be explained by the fact that the\nformer were exposed to the subjugation of their political ideals, whereas\nthe latter were furthermore disposed\nof their Kurdish identity. The use of\ntheir language and cultural traditions\nthat consequently led to a lower feeling of distinct ethnic nationalism.\nHowever, factors like the strategic alliance between the West (particularly\nthe U.S.A.) and Turkey in comparison\nto the formerly futile relationship between Iraq and the West, and the use of\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass de-struction, which were deployed against\nthe Kurds in the late 1980s, also served\nto increase nationalist consciousness\namong the Kurds in Iraq.\nAlthough Kurdish Independence\nmovements in Iran have similarly been\noppressed as in Turkey, Iraq and Syria,\nthe Kurds in Iran have experienced\nlesser degrees of cultural cultivation.\nLikely because of their same Aryan\nbackground and their Indo-European\nlinguistic heritage with their Persian\nneighbours. The Kurds in Iran were\neven capable of establishing a short-livedindependentKurdishstatein1946\nwith the help of the Soviet Union. Other modern short-lived Kurdish states/\nkingdoms have been the Kingdom of\nKurdistan and the Republic of Ararat.\nAlthough these states were never officially recognized by the international\ncommunity, they clearly indicate the\nwill of the Kurdish people to govern\nthemselves in order to prevent national suffrage by external rulers. The\nKurdish question in the Middle East,\nseemingly more complicated than the\nwell-known plight of the Palestinians,\nremains to this day to be a disputed\nissue which has haunted the lives of\nmany ethnic Kurds. This has resulted\nin the expulsion of many of them to the\nWest, particularly Western-Europe,\nwhere their inalienable rights, their\nbasic four freedoms of expression, as-sembly, association and the media are\nrespected and where they continue to\nconstitute a major lobbying force in favour of granting the Kurds self-govern-ment in their countries of origin.\nTurkish military defending their territory.\n\n"
