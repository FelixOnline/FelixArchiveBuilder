It appears that\nin the past, a certain amount of tact & discretion\nsprinkled with luck saw the function through to Is finish.\nBut last Friday for a brief moment, luck was elsewhere\nand the tact & discretion had, on the one side, been\nstretched by the previous twelve hours hard grind in\nsetting the event up, and on the other, lost in the seams\nof the casual attire.\nWhen matters began to come adrift there were no\nrules, regulations, strict understandings for anyone to\nconsult as a means of arbitration. Was the Country House\nstrictly and unequivocally booked, or did RCSU just\nhave the use of it? Maybe it is time the Warden of\nSilwood clarified the matter.\nMeanwhile, the cankerous destruction called \" ill feeling\" seems to be demanding redress on behalf of\nthe Silwood students. But it is to Silwood's credit that\nthe hard-liners who are determined to \"give RCS a kick\nup the a \u2014 \" at almost any cost are in a minority \u2014\nvengeful motivations never could quite be correlated to\nmature attitudes.\nDick Cook, the Silwood Park Students Committee\nChairman, has made it clear that discussion and close\nco-operation is now essential if this kind of thing is\nto be avoided in future years.

Could it\n>\nen here?\nAS THE conflict between the University authorities and the Students' Union at\nLancaster crystal lise s into its wider\nperspective which closely allies itself\nwith the \" irresistible force meeting an\nimmovable object\" paradox, it becomes\nworthwhile to examine the current issues\nwhich are now being tossed from hand to\nhand like grenades and relate to their\nassociation with many of the historical aspects of the University and the growth\nof the Union there .\n\"The seeds of this conflict were sown\nin the past and the almost traditional\nlack of detente.\"\nThe seeds of this conflict were sown\nin the past and the almost traditional\nlack of detente between the University\nand the Union ensured that those seeds\nmatured into a serious conflict of ideas.\nFirst let us look at the University\nitself. Only circumstantial evidence exists\nwhich supports the view that \" Big Business\" has a decisive say in the way\nthe University is run, viz., the proliferation\nof business departments which are now to\nbe merged into a huge block paid for by\nprivate enterprise. This is hardly con-clu sive proof. But consider further that\nthe claim of \" all the academic staff are\nnow yes men\" does appear to have some\nkind of basis in the fact that in 1972\nseveral outspoken junior academics were\nsacked from the English Department; the\nBiology Department used to have three\nmembers of ASTM S \u2014 it now has none;\nthe head of the Sociology Department,\nJohn Wakeford (w tio held radical views), was replaced by someone less controversial. The latter event provoked a great\ndeal of letter writing (to no avail) but no\nmilitancy .\n\"...(the University's Vice-Chancellor)\nhas remained adamant in his refusal to\nrecognise the Lancaster Union's elected leadership.\"\nIt is at this point that the student left-wing will stand up and say that this\n\" emasculation of the academic staff into\nyes men\" was a necessary condition for\nfinancial investment by business interests\nwho did not want any kind of controversy\nto interfere with what they were doing.\nBut again, the evidence is inconclusive. Now let us consider the development\nof the Students' Union at Lancaster.\nOriginally there existed a peculiar\nfederal system of Junior Common Rooms\nwhich elected their own representatives\nto s it on the sovereign body, the Student\nRepresentative Council which took all the\nimportant decisions on behalf of the\nUnion's membership. Federation meetings\n(ie meetings which were open to all students) had no power and were only\nable effectively to recommend decisions\nto the S RC. In other words, the Council\nhad all the powers (and more) that UGM's currently have.\nThis anachronistic representational\ndemocracy inevitably gave way to direct\ndemocracy with campus-wide ballots and\nthe creation of a Union Executive which\nis mandated by Union General Meetings.\nThis move was extremely significant\nsince it introduced the concept of\ncollective responsibility.\nIt was the beginning of the road leading to the current conflict when Charles Carter, the University' s Vice Chancel lor\n(the equivalent of IC's Rector) stated\nthat he found the changes in the Union's, structure \" totally unacceptable\". Having adopted such an uncompromising attitude,\nhe has remained adamant in his refusal to\nrecognise the Lancaster Union's elected\nleadership. It is this that I personally see as the tap root of the current situation.\n\"Yet all the current signs ...seem to\nindicate that the University is determined to 'settle this nonsense once and\nfor all' on their own terms.\"\nThe rest of the story has been essentially\na series of provocations and escalations\nfor which neither side have been altogether\nblame lees. This kind of breakdown in com mu nica tion, this lack of detente responsible for\na large number of disputes developing into\nstrikes during the early days of organised\ntrade unionism. Confrontations were\nconsistently ex acer bator y whilst talks\nand negotiations always proved to be the\nfirst step to a solution. Yet alI the current\nsigns associated with the Lancaster\ndispute seem to indicate that the University\nis deter minded to \"settle this nonsense\nonce and for all\" on their own terms.\nSo let us now examine just what the\n\" nonsense\" is. A student at Cartmal College (Lancaster\nhas an inter-collegiate system),following\nthe Union's policy went on rent strike in\nopposition to the Government's cuts in\nEducational expenditure. He also applied\nfor a financial hardship grant. He was refused one because he was on rent strike. An EG M was called to discuss the matter\nand as a result there followed an occupation of the University administration\nbuilding. The policy was twice re-affirmed\nby UG M's attended by over 1300 students\nand participated in by several hundreds\nthroughout its twelve-day period.\n\"Thus we have the pattern of escalation:\na series of mutual provocations...\"\nAfter the eviction by the Police, thirty-three students (including the entire union\nexecutive) were singled out for disciplinary action to be dealt with by a special tribunal.\nSuch a tribunal could only be set up by a meeting of the University Senate which duly\nmet. There does appear to be some evidence\nto support the view that the Senate meeting\nwas in fact unconstitutional because the\nstudent representatives were barred from\nAS THE situation at\nLancaster University hubbies\nand bubbles, MIKE WILLIAMS\noutlines the background and\ngives his own analysis of the\ndispute.\nattending. The students therefore felt\nentitled to label the tribunal a \"kangaroo\ncourt\"; the Union refused to recognise the\ntribunal and as a result, the matter appeared\nto be concluded with a heavy batch of\nex plus ions, again including the entire union\nexecutive.\n\"The solution is deceptively simple:\nOne goes right back to the tap root, the\nbreakdown in communications, the lack\nof detente.\"\nThus we have the pattern of escalation:\na series of mutual provocations: (1) the\nUnion goes on rent strike, thus provoking\nthe University;( ii) the University refuses\na student a hardship grant, thus provoking\nthe Union; ( iii) the Union decides on an occupation, thus provoking the University;\n(iv) the University gets the Police to evict\nthe students and then sets up a \"kangaroo\ncourt\", thus provoking the Union;( v) the\nUnion retaliates by refusing to recognise\nthe authority of the tribunal, thus provoking\nthe University; (vi) the University finally\nexpels some students, thus provoking the\nUnion. God, what a total mess! Where does\none go from there? The solution is deceptively simple: One goes right back to the\ntap root, the breakdown in communications,\nthe lack of detente.\nThe argument now impinges itself\nsquarely on Vice Chancel lor Charles\nCarter and his hitherto uncompromising\nattitude in refusing to recognise the Union's elected leadership.The only truly purposeful\nsolution to the Lancaster dispute can be a diplomatic one. A crushing defeat or a stunning victory for'either side will set an\nincredibly dangerous precedent.\n\"Indeed, the Governors at Lancaster\nmay eventually determine that (the\nVice-Chancellor's) removal would be\nthe only alternative to closing the\nUniversity.\"\nIf the students at Lancaster decide that\ntheir VC is taking a bit too much advice\nfrom the business interests which are\npresent on the campus, then the Union\nmight conceivably see a route to success by directing a campaign not against the\nUniversity authorities, but against the\novert prejudices of a much more vulnerable\ntarget: Charles Carter. Indeed the Governors\nat Lancaster may eventually determine that\nhis removal would be the only alternative\nto closing the University. It's now up to\nthe Lancaster VC.* Now the question which this article asks is: \" Could it happen here?\" The answer in\nmy view is: \"Currently, no.\" At present IC/ ICU relations serve as an almost impeccable\nmodel for other institutions of higher\neducation as far as detente goes. It is a tribute to the individuals and personalities\ninvolved that things have stayed that way\nfor so long. But it remains a pity that such\nan example cannot rub off on Lancaster.\n\n"

It was their contention\nthat since the bar is run strictly\nas a private club and that any\nextension applies to the club\nand n to to the function for\nwhich the extension was applied\nfor, then they, it seemed, were\nentitled to buy drinks at the\nbar.\nIt was RCS U's contention\nthat since the Silwood students\nwere without tickets and\nimproperly dressed, then they\nhad no right to be at the\nfunction which had cost those\npresent \u00a38 for a double ticket.\nIt is understood that the\nstudents later left feeling very\ndisgruntled after mention was\nmade of some' heavies' possibly\nbeing called upon to 'bounce'\nthem.\nLegally, the situation is\nconfused and is best considered\nin terms of other College\nfacilities .

If however,\nthe House has the status of,\nsay, the Union Bar, then whilst it is possible to hold a function\nthere, no student can be barred\nfrom using that facility.

It\nwas after this time that the\nCollege Parking Committee met\nto discuss these very statistics\nwhich had been gleaned and\nconcluded that the Parking\nWarden would have to tighten\nup on illegally parked cars.

There is a great deal of\nspeculation and anxiety, not only from\nstudents but from College authorities as\nwell. The rumour that the grant would go\nup to \u00a3750 (a24% rise) apparently sent a number of Vice Chancellors and Hall Wardens reaching for their phones in\nconsternation, because such a level\nwould be clearly inadequate in meeting\nthe economic charges for hall rents and\ncatering that they wish to charge.\n\"The familiar cycle of the grant\nbeing reduced in real value, the\nincreasing hardship caused by means\ntesting and discretionary awards and\nother anomalies begins to repeat\nitself.\" -One thing is clear: the full claim is\nnot going to be met, nor are the anomalies going to be abolished. The familiar cycle of the grant being reduced in real value,\ntt je Hncreasing hardship caused by means\ntesting and discretionary awards and\nother anomalies begins to repeat itself. It is dubious whether the increase will put us up to a similar level (in real terms,\nas that of October 1 974; with the increases\nin refectory prices and hall rents fore-cast, an inexorably declining standard.of-living for next session's students is\ninevitable.\nThe recent activities of the Association of University Teachers shows that we\nare not alone in this. The staggering\ndecline in university lecturers' real\nincomes, both in absolute terms and in\ncomparison to Civil Service salaries is\na matter of grave concern to all of us. The fact that teachers are leaving the\nuniversities for better-paid jobs points to\nthe probability of reduced staff-student\nratios (already affected by the decision not to fill certain posts which fall vacant)\nand a falling standard of education.\n\"What response will students and\nlecturers give to this situation? The\nanswer is becoming more and more\nclear: militancy and disruption.\"\nWhat response will students and\nlecturers give to this situation? The answer is becoming more and more clear\nmilitancy and disruption. The policies of\nthe present Government are driving even\nself-styled \" moderates\" to direct action. Witness the pledge of the Liberals elected\nat Lancaster to maintain the campaign\nin defence of the rent strike instigated\nby the Left, and to call for further\noccupations if the University does not\nbudge. Witness the consist an tUG Ms of\n1500 students or more at Warwich, call hg for maintenance of the occupation there;\nin spite of the Left's misgivings, and in\nspite of impending examinations. Add to\nthat the new tone of the hitherto super-moderate \" professional\" association, the AUT, now willing to contemplate,\ndisrupt ing examinations.\nIt is crucial that this new wave of\nmilitancy should be seen in context.\nNo-one seriously believes that an\neconomic crisis will be solved by cutting\nbacK on education a I expenditure . In fact,\nwhen those cuts begin to bite into the\nquality and standard of education, they\nbecome counterproductive by reducing\nthe stock of skilled manpower which is essential to Britain' s economy. Many\npeople Tn education now recognise that\nthey are fighting to maintain standards;\nfrom this point there can be no shrinking\nbecause further cuts mean the destruction\nof the whole system. \"Comprehensive secondary education\nis well on its way to collapse through\nlack of finance; other sectors, such\nas adult education are not too far\nbehind.\"\nComprehensive secondary education\nis well on its way to collapse through\nlack of finance; other sectors such as\nadult education are not too far behind.\nThere is talk of an anti-university lobby\nin Government: this may well be True\n(though I am sceptical). However, we can only win the struggle for a decent education system by uniting with all other\nsectors; education as a whole must be\nargued for, and'fought for in every way, including direct action. \"Women's inequality is fundamentally\na function of an unequal society, and\nit is until our own social rel at i dns are changed that women will cease\nto occupy an inferior position .\"\nThe visit of Germaine Greer to IC, at\nthe R CSU Annual Dinner proved to be an enlightening one. I have never been a great admirer of Dr Greer, not because I am ap posed to equality between sexes,\nbut because I believe that she has often\ntrivial f sed the entire question and failed\nto link it to the c erft raI conflicts within\nour society at the present time. Womerj's inequality is fundamentally a\"? unction of\nan unequal society, and it is not.uni u our\nown social relations are changed that\nwomen will cease to occupy an inferior\nposition.\nNevertheless, there are many aspects\nof social equality which can be fought\nfor, and these include equal pay, working\nconditions and soon. The outstanding\nTrevor Phillips\nexample at the present time is that of\nthe right of women to have abortions\nperformed.Dr Greer delineated the factors\ninvolved eloquently and accurately and\nI would not even attempt to reproduce her\nexposition. But it is clear that the\npropose ls of James White, MP, would\ndrive many women back to the \" backstreet\" abortionists, and cause an\nimmense amount of suffering. Fundamenta ll y, Mr White seeks to limit the right of\nthe'woH ten to terminate her pre g ann cy,on v flimsy and in places false ground's. It wilt\nnot stop abuses', it will encourage them.\nMr Wh if es dubious brand of morality\nwould drive us back into the pre - 1967.\ndays, in spite of the fact that the Lane\"\nCommittee on Abuses of the 1967 Act,( set up on the instigation of Mr White and\nhis friends) emphatically endorsed the\n1967 Act.\"... the proposals of James White,\nMP, would drive many women back t t.o the \"back-street\" abortionists, and\n\"cause an immense amount of suffer-ino\"\nI would urge everyone to help in\ndefeating this regressive and appalling\npiece of legislation, by signing the\npetitions being circulated and writing to\nyour MP and the Select Committee.\nThe AGM on May 22nd sees the award\nof Union General Awards.( It is also my\nlast General Meeting. Sob, sob.) U GA's are theoretically the Union s highest\ndistinction, and are decided upon by the\nPresident.
