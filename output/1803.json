    "content": "What\u2019s the latest in the Tories\u2019 \u201cGlobal\nBritain\u201d stance, where the UK throws\noff the shackles of the EU and expands\nits networks of trade to the far reaches\nof the globe? Why, to revert to using\na measurement system that almost no\none else in the world uses, of course.\nIn a frankly embarrassing last attempt\nto throw red meat that will keep\nbackbenchers on side, the Department\nfor Business, Energy and Industrial\nStrategy announced last week that it\nwas launching a 12-week consultation\non removing the necessity for\nbusinesses to list the metric weight\nof goods when selling them, instead\nencouraging a reversion to pounds\nand ounces. Currently, it is completely\nfine for businesses to list the weight of\ngoods in imperial measurements, as\nlong as the metric weight is also listed.\nI imagine this comes across as more\negregious to scientists than the general\npopulation, but the use of metric units\nis incredibly convenient and useful.\nThe metric system is a precursor to SI\nunits, or International Standard units,\nwhich as the name would suggest are\nused internationally. Furthermore,\nthe units can all be linked to universal\nfundamental constants, such as the\nspeed of light in a vacuum, meaning\nthey are universally applicable.\nAt the risk of telling readers how\nto suck eggs, let\u2019s go over the basic\nunits of both the metric and imperial\nsystems and see how they relate to\neach other. The basic unit of length\nis a meter, or the distance that light\ntravels in 1/299,792,458th\nof a second\nin a vacuum. A 100th\nof this is a\ncentimeter. A 1,000th\nof a meter is a\nmillimeter. Going up, 1,000 meters\nis a kilometer. The standard unit of\nmass is a kilogram, 1,000 times more\nmassive than a gram. 1,000 kilograms\ngives you what is colloquially called\na ton, however this can be referred\nto in SI units as a megagram. Every\nconversion between measures on both\nof these scales is done by a factor of 10.\nThe Imperial system, meanwhile,\ncould be described as less robust.\nWhilst there\u2019s no recorded \u201cstandard\u201d\nthat can be recalculated using\nfundamentals, the most common\nlengths used are feet and miles.\nAs a hint to the precision\nof this\ns y s t e m ,\na furlong was originally\ndefined as the distance that an ox\ncould plough before it had to rest.\nA foot is 12 inches, and a system that\nworked entirely in base 12 wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily be any less useful than the\nbase 10 metric system. However, the\ninch is made up of three \u2018barleycorns\u2019.\nDipping its toes into the base 10 pool,\nthe imperial system defines a \u2018thou\u2019 as\n1/1,000th\nof an inch. Now I bet we\u2019re\nall thinking the same thing. How the\nhell are we going to refer to the every\nday length of 1/17,280th\nof a foot?\nNot to worry, the Imperial system\u2019s\n\u2018twip\u2019 has you covered. Going beyond\na foot, we find that a yard is three feet.\nNext up there\u2019s the \u2018chain\u2019, at 22 yards\nlong. Back in base 10, a \u2018furlong\u2019 is 10\nchains,eight\u2018furlongs\u2019makeupa\u2018mile\u2019\nand three \u2018miles\u2019 constitute a \u2018league\u2019.\nWeights use the base measurement\nof a pound. An \u2018ounce\u2019 is 1/16th\nof a\n\u2018pound\u2019, and a \u2018dram\u2019 is 1/16th\nof an\n\u2018ounce\u2019. Sensible so far, but the \u2018grain\u2019\nbucks the trend, equal to 1/7,000th\nof a\n\u2018pound\u2019. Increasing in weight, a \u2018stone\u2019\nis14(not16)\u2018pounds\u2019,a\u2018quarter\u2019istwo\n\u2018stones\u2019, a measurement literally called\na \u2018HUNDREDWEIGHT\u2019 is equal to\n112\u2018pounds\u2019,andatonis2,240pounds.\nA brief flirtation with Newton\u2019s\nSecond Law defines the \u2018slug\u2019, which is\na mass that accelerates by 1 ft/s2\nwhen\na force of one pound is exerted on it.\nDare we start touting the speed of\nlight as 161875.9 nautical units per\nsecond,which,ratherthanbeinglinked\nto the universally constant speed of\nlight in a vacuum, is instead linked to\ntheAdmiraltyKnot,orthenice,round,\neasy to remember 6,080 feet per hour?\nI\u2019m aware that I\u2019ve made somewhat\nof a straw man out of the suggestion to\nstart selling fruit and veg by the pound\nratherthanthekilogram,buttheglobal\ncommonality brought about by the\nmetric system is genuinely something\nutopian that I think should be\nprotected. In 1999, the Mars Climate\nOrbiter began entering the orbit of the\nred planet at the climax of a $500,000\nmillion (today\u2019s money) mission,\nbut the probe came too close to the\nsurface and communication was lost,\nassumedlybecauseithadburntup.The\nreason for this, it was later discovered,\nwas that whilst NASA had been\nworking with the metric system, the\nbuilder of the craft, Lockheed Martin,\nhad been using US imperial units.\nThe current mix of imperial and\nmetric units used in Britain today\nis harmless, and most importantly\npeople are used to them. Whether\na road sign is written in miles or\nkilometres is irrelevant to the\nconstruction of the Shard, where\nunits matter a great deal.

This covers affiliations,\nevents and awards, meaning that the the\nindividual has the ability to purchase\ntickets to sports awards, Varsity (if\napplicable) and other relevant events.\nMove Imperial will subsidise further\nevents. Category 1b consists of payment\nfor, and organisation of, coaches to the\nHarlington training ground. This will be\npaid by a club membership additional\nto standard IA membership, paid by\nindividual club members to the Union,\nwho in turn will transfer the money to\nMove Imperial to be managed.\nSpending on top of this has previously\nsat within the remit of Move Imperial,\nwho managed the money of sports clubs\nand allocated spending in areas such\nas kit acquisition as they saw fit. The\nnew model will return this power to\nclubs, though the club can still allocate\nmoney to Move Imperial to manage\ncertain things, should they choose to.\nKit acquisition, training, travel and\ncompetition fees can be manager by\nMove Imperial, though purchases must\nbe approved by the club and will be paid\nfor using the club\u2019s money, rather than a\nwider Move Imperial funding pot.

This gives clubs near\ncomplete autonomy over the prices they\ncharge for membership, what members\npay for on an individual basis and the\ngeneration and expenditure of self\ngenerated income.\nIssues not addressed in the new model\ninclude problems in the acquisition of\nkit, which have been rife over the last\ntwo years according to multiple sport\nclubs.\nA hockey team this year were\ndelivered 15 sets of kit, the one less than\nthe number in a team with no spares\nor kit for subs. This meant that players\ndid not have their own individual kits\nand placed a large burden on the team\ncaptain, who had to personally wash\nevery kit and bring them to each match.\nIndia Marsden, DPCS, said of the\nchanges \u201cWith the clear mandate set\nby Union Council to give students\nfull autonomy running the clubs, we\nhope that this change to the model will\nrealise this by giving the financial and\nmanagerial power back to the clubs\u201d\nfaculties across the College.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nThe opioid epidemic and the future of pain treatment\nJames Desmet Science Writer\nAccording to the WHO, opioids\nglobally are responsible for nearly\n70% of drug-related deaths, with more\nthan 30% of opioid deaths being caused\nby overdose. The WHO estimates that\n115,000 people a year die of opioid\noverdoses in the United States alone.\nHowever, despite the dire consequences,\nmany of the strongest opioids are on the\nWHO\u2019s list of essential medicines for\ncertain diseases. Continued use of these\ndrugs, even to treat debilitating diseases,\nis a major issue for the developed world.\nSo, what is being done to resolve the\nproblem, and what is its origin?\nWhen opioids travel through the\nbloodstream, they can pass the blood-brain barrier and bind to a family of re-ceptorscalledmu-receptorsinthebrain.\nThe interaction between these receptors\nand opioids triggers the same feeling of\npleasure received from activities such as\neating, exercise and sex. This rewarding\nfeeling can become a strong motivator\nfor repeated use of opioids after pain has\nsubsided. It often leads to opioid abuse.\nA catalyst for this problem was that\nin the 1990s and early 2000s, pharmaceutical companies aggressively marketed the use of opioid drugs. One of the\nbiggest culprits was the now-discredited\ncompany Purdue Pharma, owned by the\nSackler family. Purdue targeted and persuaded physicians to prescribe opioids\nand quickly increase their dosage, ensuring almost certain opioid addiction.\nThis was sold to the physicians on the\npretext that opioids were not addictive\nif taken for genuine pain. Furthermore,\nflimsy \u2018evidence\u2019 was provided to back\nup the claim. In this manner, the path to\naddiction was almost assured, resulting\nin the ongoing opioid addiction crisis.\nOn April 2nd 2019, in something of an\nacknowledgement of their role, Purdue\nPharma pleaded guilty to charges of\nmisleading the public with their opioid\nmarketing.\nIn order to try to combat the issue\nof opioid addiction, scientific research\nhas expanded rapidly since the beginning of the 2010s to find alternative,\nnon-addictive pain medications. In recent years, there have been significant\nresearch breakthroughs using a variety\nof approaches.\nOne particular methodology which is\nbeing developed involves the pH of injured tissue. A number of different types\nof injured tissue within the body, includ-ingmusculardamageandbonefractures,\nhave a lower pH than healthy tissue. A\nresearch group at the Zuse Institute Berlin have sought to capitalise on this with\na series of compounds whose pKa (ten-dency to lose or gain a hydrogen atom)\nclosely matches the expected pH levels\nof wounded tissues. The Institute has\ndeveloped molecules that are only active\nin the specific pH environments associated with targeted wounded\ntissues. This is a\ncommon practice used in medicinal chem-istry, with the\ninactive form\nof a drug being known as a\n\u2018prodrug\u2019.\nThe idea behind this is that\nit will prevent\nside effects associated with\ncurrent opioid\npain medications \u2013 much\nsmaller concentrations of the\nactive drug will\nbe present in the\nbody, and only\nat the sites of injury. This means it will\nnot be binding to the mu-receptors in\nthe brain; the prodrug will not be con-vertedtoanactivedruginthebrain,thus\nso long as the prodrug itself does not\nbind, the addictive nature of the drug\nshould be significantly lowered. Several\ndrugs have been shown to relieve pain by\nthis mode of action. The efficacy of these\ndrugs is set to be tested in clinical trials\ncommencing in 2023.\nAnother approach that is showing\npromise involves targeting specific sodium channels within the body, vital\nto relaying pain to the brain. One such\ncompound is Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019\nVX-548.Thisdrugaimstoselectivelyinhibit the NAV 1.8 receptor, which plays\na key role in relaying pain signals to the\nbrain.Itisknownthatpeoplewithmuta-tions in this receptor can experience extreme pain, even in the absence of injury.\nBlocking this receptor may prove to be\nan innovative alternative to opioid pain\nmedication. However, due to its extreme\nsimilarities to other sodium channels,\nlots of candidates have shown dangerous\nside effect and toxicity profiles.\nDespite these challenges, the recent\nclinical candidate of VX-548 is showing\npromise, having outperformed a placebo\nin phase II clinical trials. \u201cThese results\nare terrific, and the side effect profile is\nvery good,\u201d says Professor John Wood, a\nneurobiologist who has studied the biology behind NAV 1.8 blocking.\nIt is important to note that VX-548\nstill needs to pass phase III clinical trials and gain subsequent approval from\nagencies such as the FDA. This is no\nsmall step; over 40% of all drugs entering phase III trials never make it to mar-ket. Most commonly, this is because of\nunwanted side effects or safety concerns.\nWith opioids having killed many and\ndestroyed the lives of many more, the\npossibility of effective alternatives taking the place of opioids is an exciting\nprospect. However, while the opioid\nproblem this world is facing may soon\nbecome a thing of the past, the impact it\nhas had on the lives of those affected will\nlive on for decades to come.\nJames Desmet traces the roots of the opioid epidemic and explores developments in pain medication\nIN RECENT YEARS,\nTHERE HAVE BEEN\nSIGNIFICANT\nRESEARCH\nBREAKTHROUGHS\nUSING A VARIETY\nOF APPROACHES\n\u201c\n\n"

Instead of celebrating this\ngrand occasion \u2014 the beginning of the\nthird and, arguably, the most influential\ndecadeofmylife\u2014inaspectacularfashion, I opted for a quiet, normal indulgence \u2014 birthday cake. I lacked the will\nto bake my own so I figured that I would\nbuy one from the supermarket. However, the supermarket varieties seemed\ntoo bland and boring for the prices that\nwereoffered.Ialsodecidedthatcakewas\ntoo unhealthy, however I was not going\nto forgo at least a minor indulgence for\nmy birthday. In the end, I came to the\ndecision that Sainsbury\u2019s brand, fresh-ly-baked chocolate chip cookies were my\ntreat of choice.\nFalling victim to the sway of a late-night snack, I indulgently ate one of\nthe cookies. I vaguely knew that snacking just before bedtime was a bad thing,\nhowever I did not know the exact reason for this. When bedtime came, I fell\nasleep naturally. Unfortunately, I was\nsoon to be made aware of my grave er-ror.Inthemiddleofthenight,sometime\naround 1 am, I suddenly woke up. Usually, I would be apathetic about such an\nawakening \u2014 maybe a vehicle alarm or a\nroaring motorbike engine was responsi-ble. However, this time, no matter how\nhard I tried, I could not fall back asleep.\nRegardless of the number of tosses and\nturns, rhythmic breaths, or imaginings\nof a distant, quiet paradise, I could not\nreturn to my slumber. Furthermore, not\nonly was I awake, but I was alert; it was\nlike I had not slept for only 2 hours. In\nthe morning, I felt lethargic and tired,\nand wished that I had never eaten that\ncookie.\nWhilstsugarisoftenbrandedasharmful and unhealthy, it is essential for the\nproper functioning of the human body.\nAt a fundamental level, sugar forms the\nbackbone of our genetic makeup, with\nDNA being composed of innumerable\ndeoxyribose-containing nucleotides.\nNot only does sugar play a role in our ge-netics, but it serves as the primary source\nof energy for all living organisms. It\ntherefore must not be viewed with complete disfavour. However, the worrying\nform of sugar \u2014 added sugar, which\nmakes its way into our food and drinks\n\u2014 does deserve its bad reputation.\nInthepast,sugarytreatswerereserved\nonly for the rich. During this period, the\nbulk of the human population persisted\non a diet rich in vegetables and fruit \u2014\nfood which can be cultivated with relative ease, and which reduced the need\nfor travel. In fact, the birth of agriculture\npaved the way for modern societies; the\nlossoftheneedtotravelallowedfamilies\nto congregate into communities \u2014 first\ncame the village, then the town, and ultimately the city.\nIt was only years after the industrial\nrevolution of the 1700s that the techniques required to process sugar on a\nlarge scale became available. However,\ntechnology was not the only factor that\nplayed a role in the proliferation of sug-ar. Sophisticated distribution networks\nwere necessary for the invasion of sugar\n\u2014 a crop grown in warm regions such as\nthe Caribbean \u2014 into western Europe.\nThe lack of such networks created a scarcity of sugar in Europe, and with scarcity\ncomes increasing prices. The profitability of the sugar trade thus caught the eye\nof past western powers, namely France\nand Britain, and spawned many of the\nconflicts in the West Indies in the 18th\nand 19th\ncentury.\nOnce sugar was introduced to the\nwestern world, its consumption grew\nlarger and larger, reaching a peak, in\n1961, of 47.3 kg per capita in the UK.\nHowever, in 2019, the sugar consumption in the UK was just 29.8 kg per capi-ta. What happened? A quick and simple\nanswerwouldrevolvearoundpurchasing\npower. The costs of living outpaced wage\ngrowth during the decades that elapsed\nbetween the 1960s and today. Accounting for inflation, the cost of tuition is\nhigher and the costs of home-ownership\nare higher. This argument might seem\nconvincing, but if you have ever visited\na supermarket, you would think other-wise.\nOf all the snacks found in a super-market, custard creams are my favourite.\nIn a Tescos store, a packet of 32 custard\ncreams is worth 40 pence. One custard\ncream biscuit, according to the pack-aging, accounts for 4% of your recommended daily sugar intake \u2014 and the\nunhealthiness of this is signposted in\nred. 40 pence will not make a dent in\nanyone\u2019s budget, and sugary snacks are\ngenerally very cheap in comparison to\nhealthier alternatives. The decline in\npurchasing power per capita is therefore not responsible for the fall in sugar\nconsumption. The difference between\nthe 1960s and today is that we are now\naware of the consequences of high sugar\nconsumption.Healthy-eatingcampaigns\nandWeightWatcher\u2019sadshavemorphed\nourtasteforsugarfromsweetandsuccu-lent to poisonous and toxic. This change\nin social taste is ultimately responsible\nfor the fall in sugar consumption, to the\nbenefit of us all.\nThe real danger of sugar is that it is\njust as addictive as many of the mainstream illegal drugs \u2014 I will use cocaine\nas an example \u2014 yet it is much cheaper.\nA quick internet search will reveal that\n3.5 g of cocaine costs between \u00a395-120,\namounting to a price of \u00a327-35 per gram\nof cocaine. One custard cream in the\nTesco\u2019s pack of 32 contains 3.4 g of refined sugar, amounting to a price of 0.24\npence per gram of sugar. The unit price\nof cocaine is therefore 13,000 x the unit\nprice of sugar. An addiction to cocaine\nwould therefore drive you into bank-ruptcy, as it often does for many of its\naddicts, whereas an addiction to sugar\nwould hardly place a financial penalty\non the sugar addict. This cheapness of\nsugar, combined with its potency, makes\nitadeadlythreattothepoorestmembers\nof society, who lack the financial power\nto buy healthy food.\nDespite our thorough understanding\nof the sugar crisis, not much is being\ndone about it. This has a simple expla-nation. For any problem that demands a\nchange in public policy, nothing will be\ndone to fix that problem unless there is a\npolitical incentive \u2014 more votes \u2014 to\ndo so. Making it tougher for people to\nbuy their favourite food, whether it is\nunhealthy or not, hurts the consumer\nand hurts the supermarkets, although it\nwould be for the greater good of society.\nThe government must therefore proceed with caution on this matter.\nUnfortunately, the approach that\npolicy-makers must take is unclear. Action could come in the form of a sugar\ntax, which has already been applied to\nsoft drinks in the UK, or sanctions on\nsupermarkets which offer discounted\nsnacks and buy-one-get-one-free deals.\nAll approaches would likely be met with\nfierce resistance from the consumers\nand from the powerful companies that\nbenefit from the sugar crisis. Despite\nthese obstacles, action must be taken to\nclamp down on high sugar consump-tion. A substance that impairs cognitive\nfunction, renders it consumers prone to\nmental disorders, and is just as addictive\nas a class A drug should not be found for\n0.24 pence per gram on the shelves of\nTesco.\nThe sugar crisis\nRat studies have suggested that sugar is just as addictive as cocaine. Is high sugar consumption really that bad? Comment writer\nJustin Macharia offers his opinion.\nCommentWriter\nJustinMacharia\nI cannot get over my deep sadness. It\u2019s\nlike a separate part of me, a whole human being that I carry on my back. But I\ndon\u2019t want to do this to myself anymore.\nSix years of damage to my body.

The sadness of actually doing\nthis to myself is hard to grapple with.\nIt is profoundly offensive to me that I\npoured poison into my body for six years\nbecause, as a teenager, I had no reliable\nstress outlets, and no support to which I\nwas entitled.\nMy predicament is not like those of\ndrug addicts, or alcoholics, but I do relate to their stories of years lost, opportunities not taken, relationships missed.\nI feel sad that I would often lock myself\naway, hoping the diet soda would help\nme sustain yet another impossible diet,\nrefusing traveling, work experience,\nfamily evenings, social events.\nIt has been six years since I ripped\nopen the lukewarm eight-can pack of\nPepsi Max for the first time, and drank\nevery single one in less than four hours.\nDuringtheweekIhadnoaccesstothe\nstuff, but on the weekends, I would buy\nmassive packs and drink them all.\nThis really frightened people who\nwere looking over me at the time, but I\nwenttoeveryextenttocontinuemyhab-it.

No harm in try-ing.\nFirst week. No cans?\nAt first, I wanted to try dropping the\nstuff cold turkey. At the end of the first\nday, I had a massive bout of overeating,\nwith a massive headache too. Yes, yes,\nthe pain in the head recalls the narrator\u2019s psychological pain, etc etc. For four\ndays I held on. Then I did more research,\nand learned that it would be better to\ncut down gradually.

The skyline\nin the late afternoon is crooked and bent\nat an angle, it\u2019s all rotating, but I know\nwhere I\u2019m going. I go up the stairs, and\nI open the door, and even after all these\nyears, there is no awkwardness. Long\nhave I asked for this time, wrote about\nit and described it against logic, against\nhope, against even failure and silence,\nlike pressing a button again and again\n\u2013 and here it is. I have described it and\nasked it into being. And there is enough\ntime. There is so much time, I asked and\nasked and asked for time, and here it is.\nThe words, the words are there, in my\nhead, and I am faithful to them, but I am\nsilent. And because we are silent togeth-er, I know the words are true.\nFour cans on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Easter Sunday.\nLocking up the Easter chocolate in\nmy university locker does not stop the\nbeast. So I commute through the city,\non the bus, at 10pm to get to the locker\nand free the unlikely prisoners. Nothing helps. The cravings are everywhere.\nI could have chosen not to act on them\n\u2013 but why would I want to? What is the\nPOINT of all of this, anyway?\nSecond week. Three cans each day.\nI have been overeating so much that\nI can feel a visible difference all over my\nbody. Is this even worth it?

With each\nday that passes, my focus and my appetite improve. And still, I cannot hide\nthat I am haunted.

    "content": "Want to secure your the data\nin your daily life? Here is the\nlong-awaited guide!\nMessaging\nMost of our communication nowadays happens via messaging apps, first\nand foremost WhatsApp (WA). These\napps offer different level of security.\nWhatsApp secures content data (i.e.,\nthe message itself), but shares meta data\nwith other Facebook companies to enhance their services (limited in EU by\nGDPR).\nA good alternative is Signal. Signal is owned by the non-profit Signal\nFoundation, which is heavily backed\nby WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton.\nAlongside E2EE, Signal implements the\nzero-knowledge encryption (ZKE), reducing meta data to the bare minimum.\nThere are also other apps that have\nE2EE but are simply not that widely\nused and hence not recommended in\nthis article; a messaging app is only attractive when others use it too.\nThis leads to the biggest problem with\nswitching to alternative messaging apps:\nmany of your friends may not be reachable on them.\nIf you can move your frequent com-munication(forexample,withyourclos-est friends and family) from data-hun-gry apps such as WA and Telegram to\nalternatives such as Signal (see table\nbelow), you can significantly improve\nthe security of your digital life. Organisations like Meta (owner of Facebook\nand WhatsApp) will no longer have the\nsame access to the meta data from your\npersonal communications.\nEmail\nMost email providers such as Google\nand Outlook have implemented\ntransport encryption as a standard.\nNonetheless, Google, Outlook and\nother such providers can still read your\nmessages (implying emails are in general\nless secure than say, WhatsApp).\nThere are two standards for E2E encryption of emails \u2013 S/MIME and PGP.\nThe problem with these is that both \u2013\nsender and recipient \u2013 need to install\ncertificates first before one can start exchanging encrypted emails.\nA good compromise is to encrypt at\nleast email attachments with services\nsuch as Dracoon (dracoon.com). Here,\ninstead of attaching a file to an email,\nyou share a link. This is not only more\nsecure,butalsoagreatsolutionforlarger\nfiles. You get up to 10GB of free cloud\nstorage \u2013 and this can be E2E encrypted.\nIf you want to add S/MIME to your\nCollege email address, please get in\ntouch with the ICT Service Desk or\nGoogle for S/MIME Imperial College.\nCloud\nOneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive\nare all similar in data security. Due to\ntheir scale, data on these platforms are\ngenerally well-protected against hackers\nand data leaks. Nonetheless, in theory,\nthe companies themselves, and governments (in most countries by an official\ncourt order) can access the data, too.\nA possible solution is to encrypt one\u2019s\ndata before uploading it. A good software package (freeware, open source) is\noffered by a German company, crypto-mator.org.\nCloud companies can (and do) analyse meta data of your cloud usage. If\nthis is a concern, you can also look out\nfor smaller, privacy-focused cloud com-panies, such as dracoon.com (Germa-ny-based), sync.com (UK-based), or tre-sorit.com (Switzerland based). There are\nlots of rankings on the internet. After a\nlittle research you can find cloud options\nyou feel comfortable with and that you\ntrust.\nHard drive\nLosing your laptop or having it stolen\ncan mean that your data is not only lost,\nbut also that strangers might have access\nto it. Windows and Mac both offer sys-temintegratedencryptionofdatathatin\ngeneral offers a good level of protection.\nIf you want to go for an open-source\noption with advanced encryption meth-ods, VeraCrypt (a software from 2013)\nis a popular standard. This especially\nmakes sense for data you do not access\ndaily (such as pictures).\nHope you liked the guide! Please let\nme know if you adopted some of the\nideas (mar21@ic.ac.uk)!

The polymer-isation of ethylene produces various\nplastics, specifically polyethylene (PE),\nwhich is used in a wide range of essential\neveryday products, including packaging\nfilm, shopping bags, and housewares.\nHowever, ethylene production is\nalso one of the most energy-consuming\nprocesses today. The current method\nof producing ethylene involves steam\ncracking, which breaks down long,\nsaturated hydrocarbon chains into\nsmaller compounds such as ethane and\nethylene. These molecules must then\nbe separated, which has long been a\nchallenging industrial process due to\ntheirsimilarityinstructureandvolatility.\nThe current method largely used is\ncryogenic distillation, an extremely\nenergy-intensive process due to its high\npressure and extremely low temperature\nrequirements. The purification of just\nethylene and propene accounts for\n0.3% of global energy consumption\u2014\ndecreasing the energy intensiveness of\nthis ethylene separation means reducing\nthe carbon footprint of a tremendous\nnumber of plastic products worldwide.\nResearch for alternatives to cryogenic\ndistillation have been ongoing in recent\nyears\u2014for instance, the adsorptive\nbinding of ethylene to transition metal\ncentreshasbeenstudied.However,these\nprocesses are not optimised for ethylene\nseparation, as they can cause alkenes to\noligomerise and block the pores within\nthe material. Other methods that have\nbeen discovered lack the selectivity and\nefficiency required to expand them up\nto an industrial scale and decompose\nquickly due to\ncontaminants.\nHowever, a\npromising alternative\nhas been found\nin zeolites. In a\npublication in Science,\nresearchers at Instituto\ndeTecnolog\u00edaQu\u00edmica\ncollaborated with the\nExxonMobil Research\nand Engineering\nCompany to discover\na new method that\nseparates ethylene\nfrom ethane, with\nremarkable selectivity.\nThis method uses\nITQ-55, a pure silica\nzeolite with an unusual\nstructure\u2014the first of\nits kind\u2014that allows for\nits extreme flexibility.\nZeolites are porous and crystalline\nmaterials, with structures usually built\nfrom sites composed of silicon and\naluminiumatomsboundtooxygen. Soft\nhingesattheoxygenatomsconnectthese\nsites to compose the secondary building\nunits (SBUs), making zeolites flexible.\nSBUs are arranged in rings of different\nsizes, which in turn make up the full\nstructure. This produces a framework\nin which the porosity of zeolites can\nbe changed by altering the SBUs\nand pore dimensions to be tuned for\ndifferent applications. For this reason,\nzeolites have many uses in catalysis and\nas commercial adsorbents. Another\nadvantage of zeolites is their non-toxic\nand non-corrosive properties\u2014even if a\nzeolitic material were to be washed away\nin a river, the acidic sites in zeolites are\nin pores so tiny that aquatic organisms\nwould not be able to access them.\nITQ-55 is a pure silica zeolite,\nmeaning it is built only from silicon\nsites. Accordingtotheresearchersofthe\nstudy, pure silica zeolites are preferred as\nthey have no acid sites and so are not\nprone to the oligomerisation of olefins\nthe way the existing separation methods\nare. It is distinctively composed of\nheart-shaped cages interconnected by\neight membered rings. Its pore width is\nless than 2nm\u2014if the framework were\ncompletely rigid, molecules would not\nbe able to diffuse through the structure\nat all.\nITQ-55 can separate ethylene\nand ethane through the process of\npreferential diffusion. Molecules with\ndifferent properties and shapes will\ndiffuse through the pores of zeolites at\ndifferent rates\u2014this concept is called\nshape selectivity. The study found that\nthe ethylene adsorption rate to ITQ-55\nwas much greater than that of ethane\nand that the heart-shaped cages in the\nstructure hinder the diffusion of the\nrounder-shaped ethane by two orders\nof magnitude, while allowing a more\nfacile diffusion of ethylene, which has\na flatter structure. In this way, ITQ-55\ncan act as a molecular sieve, separating\nethane and ethylene like a chef sifting\nflour. The material seems stable for long\nperiods, too\u2014the adsorptive properties\nremained unchanged for three months.\nThis is important as the durability of a\nmaterial is a critical consideration for\nupscaling to industrial purposes. The\nremarkable selectivity of ITQ-55 is also\ndue to its unprecedented flexibility;\nthe material accepts molecules that are\nalmost 1 \u00c5 larger than its pore size.\nTherefore, when molecular diffusion\nC C C C\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nethane ethylene\nPlastic bags are made from polyethylene, which requires the process of cryogenic distillation.\n\n"

    "content": "In Colombia, 2013, a 41-year-old\npresented at the hospital with fever,\ncough and weight loss for several\nmonths. He was diagnosed with Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in\n2006 but did not follow properly the\nanti-viral therapy. Doctors carried out\nbiopsies of the lungs and lymph nodes\nof the patient and observed aggregations\nof cells, proliferating quickly, an\nalarm sign of malignant cells\u2026 cancer.\nUnexpectedly though, the cells were\nobserved to be smaller than human\ncells. Thus, doctors sent the images to\nthe Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention. Further studies revealed\nthat a parasitic tapeworm Hymenolepsis\nnana had contracted cancer inside the\npatient, which caused him also to have\ncancer. It was these cancerous cells that\nwere slowly killing the patient. How did\nthis happen?\nHIV is a virus that infects and kills\nCD4 T cells, which are immune cells essential to activate the immune response\nagainst pathogens. Untreated, HIV can\nresult in Acquired Immunodeficiency\nSyndrome (AIDS), when the count of\nCD4 T-cells in blood is below 200 cells\nper cubic millimetre. In the case of the\nColombian patient, his CD4 T-cell\ncount was 28 per cubic millimetre. He\nwas in a critical health situation. AIDS\nhad significantly weakened his immune\nsystem, increasing his risk of contracting\nopportunistic infections.\nAIDS allowed the parasitic tapeworm\nHymenolepsis nana (H. nana) to thrive\nand proliferate in his gut. Around 75\nmillion people worldwide carry of H.\nnana in their guts. In some developing\nregions of the world, as many as one in\nfour children have this parasite. H.nana\nis contracted by ingesting faeces from infected humans, rats or beetles through,\nfor example, contaminated food or dirty\nhands. The infection is generally asymp-tomatic but can cause serious complications in people with weakened immune\nsystems, such as HIV patients or steroid\nconsumers.Thisisbecausetheirimmune\nsystems cannot eliminate the parasite\neffectively. In addition, H. nana can remain in the gut for years, waiting for its\nmoment \u2013 hence why it is considered an\nopportunistic parasite.\nAfter the double infection with both\nHIV and H. nana, several aggregations\nof abundant, highly compacted cells\nstartedappearingindifferentpartsofthe\npatient\u2019s body. These cells were undifferentiated \u2013 they had yet to develop into\na particular variant \u2013 and divided very\nquickly. Both of these characteristics are\nsignsofcancer.However,testsforhuman\ncytokeratin and vimentin, biomarkers of\ncancer, returned negative results. The\ncells could not be of human origin. The\nabnormal cells fused frequently, forming multi-nucleated cells. This elicited\nthe hypothesis that the response was an\namoeba, since amoeba tend to fuse with\none another. However,\nby mid-2013, sequencing\ntechniques had shown that\nthe DNA of the abnormal\ncells belonged to H. nana.\nUnfortunately, the patient\ndied only 72 hours after\nthis revelation. It had taken\nthe researchers months to\nestablish the origin of the\ncells.\nThe main reason for the\ndelay in diagnosis of infection by H. nana was that\nthe abnormal cells were\nconsidered too \u2018primitive\u2019 to be associated with worms. Cases of infection and\nproliferation of parasitic worms in humans are well studied, but typically the\nworms have recognisable and specialised\ntissue. H. nana developed cancer inside\nthe patient through neoplasia, rapid, abnormal growth of cells within the body.\nNeoplasiahasbeendocumentedinmany\nspecies of invertebrates, but never before\nin multicellular parasites like H. nana.\nWhy did H. nana develop cancer? Because of the indirect action of HIV. This\nvirus debilitated the immune system,\nwhich could no longer control and eliminate the population of H. nana. Consequently, H. nana was able to multiply\nexponentially. With an increasing rate\nof multiplication came an increase in\nthe rate of DNA replication and cellular\ndivision. DNA replication is not perfect\n\u2013 there is always an error rate associated\nwith it.\nThe increase in the number of replications increased\nthe number of these errors.\nThere was therefore an increase in the number of\nDNA mutations, which in\nturn led the tapeworm to\ndevelop cancer.\nThe unfortunate patient's\nluck could not be worse. The\nprobability of being infected\nwith HIV is 0.04% through\nunprotected sex, which\nis the most common method of HIV\ntransmission. H. nana affects 75 million\npeople worldwide and the global population is 8 billion people. Therefore, approximately 0.01% of the global population has H. nana. The probability of H.\nnana contracting cancer is rarer still!\nThere is no other such cases like this\u2013\nmaking it potentially the rarest cancer\nin the world. It could be argued that the\ncancer was developed by the worms and\nnot the patient. However, the patient\ndied specifically because of the cancerous cells of the worms - not due to the\nworms themselves. The cancerous cells\nformed in undifferentiated aggregations\nand duplicated rampantly, consuming\nthe resources of the body and asphyxiating surrounding functional cells, exactly\nas expected from normal cancer devel-opment.\nIn summary, the rarest cancer in the\nworldisatapewormthatcontractedcan-cer in the body of a patient with AIDS\nand caused him also to have cancer.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n4\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nThe rarest cancer in the world?\nThe only known case of cancer caused by a foreign organism, instead of the body's own cells\nPhoto credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Domain\n\n"

    "content": "As excitement grew and viewers\ntuned in to the highly anticipated\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid Champions\nLeague final, the promised night to\nremember instead became a nightmare.\nBroadcasted across the world, UEFA\u2019s\ndishonest message of a delayed kickoff due to \u2018late fans\u2019 and \u2018fake tickets\u2019\nleft a sour taste when breaking news\nnotifications told a different story of\nchaos and despair. Reports flooded in\nof thousands of Liverpool fans penned\nwithin the stadium grounds, suffering\nas police released tear gas and pepper\nspray, and beat people indiscriminately.\nWatching a Nightmare Unfold\nSet for a 9pm (CEST) kick-off, Real\nMadridandLiverpoolfansarrivedhours\nearlier to queue for entry into the Stade\nde France. Separated down different\nsides of the grounds, it soon became\napparent that there was a disturbance\nin the Liverpool section where fans\nwere not being let in. Encountering\nmultiple checkpoints where fans were\nstopped abruptly without reason,\nthere were concerns about the lack\nof communication between fans and\nmarshals. Along with this, unusual\npolicies regarding security had only\nfemale fans searched and patted down.\nFans who reached the final ticket\nvalidation turnstiles faced further\nconfusion as the gates were not opening\nas they should. Fans were informed that\ntickets were fake; tickets that had been\nvalidated prior to reaching the final\nsection and were most definitely not\nfake, were suddenly no longer working.\nAs more fans poured off the trains\nand into the grounds, poor organisation\nleft crowds building in the heat. Only\na few fans were finally allowed to enter\nthrough the last checkpoint, though\nthis was a slow process as they were\ninstructed to crawl under the non-functional turnstiles. This backlog\nsignificantly delayed the movement\nof the crowds and caused more issues\nas tickets were now being individually\nvalidated by frustrated security. As\nthe crowds continued to build into a\ncrowded space, fans attempted to keep\ncalm and communicate with each other\nto prevent crushes \u2013 a human kindness\nsoon to be met with police brutality.\nChaos\nAs large throngs of fans queued at the\ngates, agitated security called in armed\npolice who released tear gas into non-aggressive crowds and fans near gaps\nin fences or at turnstiles were pepper-sprayed. Some young children were\nattackedbeforetheirparentscouldmove\nto protect them, hurt by authorities that\nwere meant to help keep people safe.\nPerhaps more horrifying, riot police\nwere deployed against the peaceful\ncrowds and fans were left cowering as\nthose around them were beaten bloody.\nAs dismayed shouts and pained screams\nrang out, fans remained calm despite the\nterror and tried to protect themselves\nagainst the gas with scarves and flags.\nAs the onslaught continued and reports\ncontinued to flood social media, fans at\nhome no longer cared who won as the\nsafetyoftheirlovedonestookpriority.As\nthe match began, many fans were never\ngrantedentryintothestadium,andthose\nthat did described feeling \u2018shell shocked\u2019.\nLiverpool did not win the match and\nReal Madrid scored the only goal of the\ngame. Towards the end of the match,\npolice armed with automatic weapons\nflooded the Liverpool end of the stands\ndespite few guarding other sections of\nthe pitch. When the full-time whistle\nrang, Liverpool fans moved to flee the\nstadium. faced with dangerous barriers\non stairs and no direction, they feared\nwhatawaitedthem.Thatnoonesuffered\nmajor injuries is a testament to the\nfans\u2019 united patience. On descending\ntowards the exits, local hooligans were\nseen throwing flares into the grounds.\nDespite it being clear that none of the\nLiverpool fans had thrown these flares\ndue to different clothing and location,\nfans faced further violence as multiple\ntear gas cannisters were opened upon\nthe crowd. This was the final insult that\nmade it clear that the brutality towards\nthe Liverpool fans had nothing to do\nwith their behaviour but was instead\nbiased specifically towards them.\nYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\nAs police and UEFA destroyed\nthe trust of fans through their lies\nand brutality, the support Liverpool\nsupporters showed towards those\nwho were attacked was representative\nof the true spirit of football.\nLiverpool fans came together to\nsupport one another in the long queues.\nThey remembered other stadium\ndisasters where football fans have died\nduetopoororganisation,incompetence,\nand lack of humanity, so they stayed\ncalm and attempted to protect those\naround them. Images and videos have\nbeen shared of their bravery (standing\nbetween their aggressors to protect\nchildren, those with disabilities and the\nelderly), their compassion (washing the\neyes of those who were pepper sprayed),\nand their unity (remaining calm in\nhorrific circumstances and sharing what\nthey had to protect people). Many more\ntalesofkindnesswillfilterthroughandwe\nshould embrace them, as in those hours\nof chaos, the Liverpool fans exemplified\nthat they will never walk alone.\nThe Future of Football Events\nAs investigations are carried out,\nensuring that the incident will be swept\nunder the rug by UEFA and French\nauthorities, I hope that people will\nremember the humanity of those they\nclaimed brought such brutality upon\nthemselves. Should we not fight for\nthe safety of fans attending games? If\nnormal and innocent people acting\npeacefully when queuing for events\ncan be attacked without consequence,\nthings will not change. As we look to\nthe future of football events and watch\ncommunities of fans attempt to heal\nboth physical and emotional wounds\nfrom the past weekend, I hope that we\nwill also grow united so that all can feel\nsafe when watching the sport they love.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n16 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBias and Brutality: Liverpool Fans tear-gassed\nand beaten at Champions League Final\nNiamh Heneghan Sport writer\nEdited by: Amanda Barden\nKonrad Hohendorf\nSport\nPolice in riot gear (credit: Envato Elements)\n\n"

There to see Bloc Party\nlive for the third time in my life, echoes of my seminal\nexperience with them six years ago, and the actual car\ncrash that occurred on the drive back from the gig,\ncame creeping back (though that\u2019s for another article).\nFurthermore,Iwastherewithoneofmyoldestfriends,\nboth of us fans of the band for over a decade, and upon\nseeing the past-their-prime crowd we assumed that\nmost others were operating on a similar tenure.\nFormed in 1999,\nthe band that finally\nlanded on the name\n\u201cBloc Party\u201d broke\ninto the indie rock\nscene in the early\n2000s, with their\ndebut album Silent\nAlarm receiving the\nNME Album of the\nYear and the PLUG\nAwards\u2019 Indie Album\nof the Year.
