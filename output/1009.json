The defence worked\nhard to gain many\ninterceptions which, helped\nby a forceful attack, were\nconverted into goals.\nThere was some\ndangerous play in the final\nquarter, which the umpire\nfailed to pick up. However,\ndespite the frustration (and\nsome sore knees) IC held on\nand won.\nIC1 st vs St Georges 1st Despite the appalling weather\nconditions on Saturday,\ncausing a dangerous court\nthat was up to 5cm under\nwater, we made a strong start.\nIt soon became obvious that if\nwe could stop the ball from\nreaching their 6 feet tall goal\nshooter the game was ours.\nAs the cold and the wet\nconditions began to take their\ntoll we relaxed a little, but it\nwas still a convincing victory\nwith many acrobatic displays\nin the puddles.\nThanks to everyone who\nbraved the weather and the\ncourts to play. Thanks also to\nMatt who lent moral support\nand encouragement.\nTennis 0\nIC Team vs Cardiff University\nSaturday was a let down, due\nto constant rain which\nflooded the courts. We had\nfar from our best performance\nof the year, and we finished\nSaturday night with a deficit.\nHowever Sunday morning\nwas much better, by lunch\ntime we had reduced Cardiffs\nlead, and the match result\nrested on the final singles of\nthe day. Paul Cook took the\nsingles to squeeze a satisfying\n8-7 victory for I.C. Thanks to all players of\nthe team. Everyone put in\n100% effort, and there was a superb team spirit, which\nbodes well for the future.\nShaolin Kung\nFu: NamPai\nChuan 0 S Annual National Competition at City\nUniversity\nThe IC team passed the first\nround without fighting,\nhaving received a 'by' in the\ndraw. This put them up\nagainst the Shenley team,\nwho had fought well in the\nfirst round. A close round of\nfive fights ensued, with IC\ndefeating Shenley. Keith\nsustained an injury in his\nfight, and so was replaced by\nAlex. A fortuitous draw gave\nIC another 'by', thus placing\nthem against Harlston B in\nthe final.\nThe two teams showed\nthemselves to be very evenly\nmatched. Yasuda and Alex\nsuffered defeats in the first\ntwo rounds, and the third\nfight was won by Marcus.\nDave's fight proved to be the\ndecider, with three referees\nsignalling a draw. Eventually\nanother judges' decision gave\nthe victory to Harlston.\nSo after an eventful days\nfighting IC left with second\nplace and a silver trophy. Our\nthanks must go to Capt. Dave\nLloyd for his sterling effort\nand to Sifus Lai and\nGuishard for their invaluable\ninstruction.\nFootball E ICWAFCvsUCL\nIt was an average game until\nwe conceded a penalty. Helen\nmanaged to deflect the first\nshot, but UCL collected the\nball and scored. Maryam then\ndecided to take up keeping\nfor the first time, as a captain\nshould ! ? However, she gave\naway a free kick forgetting\nshe held the ball as she took\nfive steps.

    "content": "Careers\nDear Fresher,\nAdvicefrom John Simpson, Director of IC Careers Service.\nWelcome to Imperial College. The next\nthree or four years should be among the\nmost interesting and enjoyable in your\nlife, provided you make the most of the\nopportunities available at College. This\nletter aims to give you some ideas for\nyour own self-development.\nYou can probably recall one of the\nsignificant steps in your life when you\nentered the sixth form or went to sixth\nform college. Coming to College is an\neven more significant step. You have\nmore freedom, more independence and\nmore opportunities to do your own thing\nand to succeed or fail.\nIf you do not make\nsome mistakes you\nwill not have learnt\nanything, learning\nfrom one's own mistakes is an important\npart of experience, but\ndon't waste time reinventing everything, build on the experience of others - take advice (it's usually\nfree) - ignore some of it, test it out,\naccept or reject it.\nYou have already demonstrated\nsome planning ability by passing 'A' lev-els, or their equivalent, sufficiently well\nto be at College. How are you going to\nplan the next three, four or six years?\nAnd I'm not talking just about\nyour academic studies, I'm talking about the start\nof the rest of\nyour life.\nWhat do you want to achieve this\nterm? Making friends is usually high on\nmost people's list. How? Join clubs and\nsocieties, attend meetings, take up a new\nsport, develop a new interest - any of\nthese are likely to bring you into contact\nwith like-minded students. And there's always the bar to prop up while seeking\ninspiration.\nBy the end of the summer term in\nyour first year you are feeling the financial pressures - in other words you're\nbroke! So how about earning some good\nmoney in the long vacation? If you leave\njob hunting until the\nvacation starts you may\n\"HOW are yOU going tO be too late. AH the inter-plan the next three,\nfour or six years?\" e sting and lucrative jobs\nhave been filled already\nand you will be lucky if\nthe local council wants\nsome grass cutting or the\ngarden centre needs a dirty pair of hands. It's well worthwhile\ndoing some preliminary job hunting\nbetween Christmas and Easter. Call in at\nthe IC Careers Service (Room 310,\nSherfield Building) where you will find\ninformation about Vacation Training,\nwrite to employers with your CV, call in\nto some local shops and hotels and see\nwho's advertising in the local press.\nVacation jobs can be most informative. Ideally they give you the chance to\ntry out some type of work or future\nemployer in which you are interested.\nThey give you experience in job hunting,\nletter writing and interviews, as well as a real insight into what it's like to work for\na particular type of employer. Some even\npay you quite well. Jobs abroad are\npopular and early applications\nare essential. Start by visiting\nthe IC Careers Service which\nhas a good range of reference\nbooks and\naddresses.\nAt the start\nf the second year\n)u raise your\n;ht s higher. Now\n:he time to test\nr skills in organ-l something - a: i al evening for\nyour department, looking after\nthe finances of a society or\nfixtures secretary of your\nteam. That sounds too\nmuch like hard\n\"Vacationjobs can be\nmost informative.\n...Some even pay you quite well.\"\nwork, I hear you say. Yes, it does take\nsome effort on your part but generally\nspeaking the more effort you put into\nsomething the more enjoyment you will\nget out of it.\nCommittee work is excellent preparation for life after College. You learn to\nset agendas, run meetings, agree actions,\npersuade other students to do things,\nwork within budgets and end up with a successful event - a party, a visit, a play\nor a newspaper. (Think how much effort\nwent into producing this edition of\nFELIX!). You should start thinking seriously\nabout your future career before the end\nof the second year. Even if you haven'ta clue what you want to do, that's no\nexcuse for delaying finding out about the\npossibilities. You are surrounded with\nsources of information - friends, family,\ntutors, careers advisers, libraries. Start\nlooking. It may be a long process but so\nis life, so it really is worth spending\nmore time thinking about your career\nthan planning your next weekend or hol-i day. The IC Careers Service is a good\nstarting place. Pop in and speak to the\ninformation staff. Find out about\n'PROSPECT', our computer careers\nguidance system, and all the information\nbooklets and reference files. Have a look\nat some of the videos, attend some seminars on careers, get yourself sorted out.\nThe Milkround is in the spring\nterm of your final year. This is when\nemployers visit campuses to interview\napplicants or invite you to their London\nOffices.\nChristmas vacation courses are a popular way of finding out about careers\nsuch as marketing but only a few major\nrecruiters run them and they are normally over-subscribed many times.\nStop! I'm only a fresher - why are you\ntelling me all this?\nI'm telling you\nbecause you need to\nstart planning your\nlife now, don't just\ndrift through College\nand emerge with a degree and nothing\nelse. Of course a degree is important and\nmust be your first priority, but not your\nonly priority.\nIn the meantime, enjoy yourself.\n\n"

You know the\nsort of things. General phobias\nand regular worries, like worrying\nthat you might unconsciously\nstand on a table and begin\nmasturbating at parties or the\ndisconcerting habit of confusing\nthe phrases \"pass me the butter\ndarling\" with \"get out of my\n******* life you balding, french\n******\u2022\". Just the normal stuff of\neveryday modern life.\nFrankie sits in her bedroom\nin the hour before dawn, the hour\nsandwiched between 'being\nfrightened of the night and scared\nof the day' and tells us her story.\nIt's a story of collecting the rubbish\nof life, throwing away the\nrelationships, dreaming dreams,\ngetting run over and salving panic\nattacks with tuneless ukulele\nplaying. While, of course, being a tragic comedy. Except that I got\nthe feeling it was more a comic\ntragedy, in a modern sense. Most\nof the time when you were\nlaughing it was at pretty sad\nevents which is always a bit\ndisconcerting. (This excludes the\nmembers of the audience who\ndecided it was just a comedy and\nproceeded to laugh at everything\nand that included the phrase\n\"warm urine bottle\". Gee, the\nBritish sense of humour...) Still 50\nminutes is a long time for that type\nof play to hold an audience and\nPanic carried it off for most of the\ntime. 0\nAt first sight The Browning\nVersion looks like a showcase for\nold-fashioned attitudes and older\nbuildings. It opens with lush shots of\nthe Abbey School (with its Great\nHall \"built in 1550\", as the porter\nhelpfully informs us) and continues\nwith lots of close-ups of emotionally\nconstipated Englishmen keeping\ntheir upper lips stiff.\nAndrew Crocker-Harris (Albert\nFinney), a middle-aged public\nschool Classics teacher, is\nincompatibly married to Laura\n(Greta Scacchi, not getting her kit\noff). While his wife is having an\naffair with young American physics\nteacher, Frank (Matthew Modine),\nthe Croc is being gently elbowed\nout of his job. He's prepared to take\nthis on the chin like the good\nAnglo-Saxon that he is. It's only\nafter receiving an unexpected gift\nfrom a pupil that he's able to\nattempt some form of self-assertion\nin his farewell speech.\nScience replaces Greek,\nAmerican openness supersedes\nEnglish rectitude - there are\nundercurrents that might not\ninterest the casual viewer. In the\nHollywood remake the Browning of\nthe title would be the gunsmith\nrather than the poet. In an epilogue\ngrafted on by Gabriel Garcia\nMarquez, Frank and the Croc would\nblow each other away in the library\nafter prep in an orgy of macho\nposturing. As it is, in the English\nversion everyone remains impassive\nfor most of the time, while the\nswelling soundtrack lets us know\nthey're repressing their feelings like\nmad. It's low-key, but carefully done\nand with an excellent central\nperformance from Albert Finney,\nalthough he does look at least ten\nyears too old for the part.\nAfter seeing Major League II\none thing came to mind - major\ncock up. The first film had such a witty story line with the Cleveland\nIndians, a mixture of would bes and\nhas been s, winning their league.\nHowever this time the plot is almost\nthe same, the team has fallen back\ninto their old rhythm, losing, with\nCorbin Bernsen as the new owner of\nthe Indians and Tom Berenger\nending up as coach. The film's only\ncomedy comes from inverting the\ncharacters behaviour as compared\nto the original film. Charlie Sheen's Wild Thing has lost his rebellious\nside, donning Armani suits and\nbasically appearing as the squeaky\nclean boy next door. The voodoo\nguy, who could never hit curve\nballs, returns to the new season\nhaving become a buddhist and so\nloves everyone and anything. The\nfilm is not funny and you just\nwonder how Sheen, Berenger and\nBernsen ended up making such a crap film?\nMajor League II drags on for\nfar too long, and the only question\nis - why did they want to make a sequel? The film makers obviously\nhope that Sheen, Berenger and\nBernsen will sell the movie. I wish\nthem luck. \u00a9\nf FELIX3 I0CT94 "

    "content": "Clued Up\nFrater Fl am writes Being in my final studious year at\nImperial, your Frater is faced with\nthe problem of the future. In order\nto aid the crystal lisa tion of my inde-c is ion, the advice makers abound\nwith comments, the most popular\nbeing 'whatever makes you the\nmost happy'. Happy? I scream. It seems to me that the elevation of\nthe value of happiness is one of the\nprime causes of the modern\nmalaise. 50% of marriages col-lapse, juveniles turn to crime or\ndrugs, gay couples rear socially\nstunted children, and why?\nBecause these people have been\ndeluded into believing that what\nthey need most in life is happiness.\nThey strive for it in whatever distorted way they can, belittling and\nwasting others as they do so. Those\nwho fail to achieve it feel that they\nhave been cheated from some\ndivine right, and spew their guts to\nsome measly counsellor.\nBesides, happiness is\nsuch an ill defined concept- as with\nall emotions any attempt at classification will sim py bite at its own tail,\nas it cannot be defined without self\nreference (thus being classed as an\n'elemental' by your Frater).\nAnother such elemental is Quality,\nand those who have aqua in ted themselves with the twinned arts of\nzen and motorcycle maintenance\nwill be aware of the dangers of\nseeking the de feni tion of an ele-mental. It can only drive you into\nlunacy, ECT and fame as a popular\nwriter.\nI will let you into a little\nsecret. Happiness is important.\nPain, however, is also a part of life\nas are sadness, hate, love and\nPOLITICAL\nSCIENCE\nI saw Francois Girard's32 Short\nFilms About Glenn Gould at the\nRiverside Studios recently. Girard\npresents a beautiful and sympathetic portrait of Gould, who is, in\nmany ways, the perfect artist. One\nof Gould's theories is that the\nartist-audience ratio should be 0-1.\nAs I understand it, this means an\nanonymous artist producing work\nfor a single person. Gould's idea is\nto take away the commercial\natmosphere from the production of\nart.\nThe notion of an anonymous\nartist presents some interesting\npossibilities. In particular, the idea\nof an anonymous producer of art.\nWe might want to ask: can Science\nbe done like this? Can the scientist\nbe anonymous? Why do we need\nto know whose theory it is? For\nexample, why do we need to know\nthat it is Einstein's Theory of\nRelativity, and not just Theory of\nRelativity Number X08? Is there\nsomething, perhaps, in the way science is done that prevents an\nanonymous scientist?\nThere are, of course, anonymous theories around. The\nStudent'st distribution in statistics,\nfor instance. But in modern times,\nthis is a rarity.\nIs modernity the key to the\nissue, then? (\"Things aren't what\nthey used to be..\" - I don't necessarily agree with the idea that\nmorals have declined over time;\ndepression. Your Frater himself has\nbeen through the dark abyss, that\nrealm of utter despair and self\nloathing- but it was important to be\nthere, as all emotions are vital to\nthe totality of one's life. Vital they\nare, but it is worthless to have them\nas your goal. I escaped that bleak\nregion but now, as then, I do not\nseek happiness- What I seek above\nall is fulfillment, which is the\nachievement of one's will. One's route to fulfillment is an innately\npersonal matter. Sadly my will\ndirects me to gain a total understanding of reality; it takes but a fool to realise the futility of that\ntask.\nAll is nothing.\nit's just that we now know more\nabout other people). Is it the scientist's selfishness and vanity that\nforces him to name a theory as\nhis? A successful theory, or one\nthat causes controversy, will give\nhim a reputation. The reputation\nwill help advance his standing and\nsoftens the path for his next theory.\nBut there are some positive\nreasons why theories should be\ntagged with their owners. Whether\nscience is done by experimentally\narriving at some theory or by making Conjectures and Refuting them,\nthe inventor of the theory is the\none responsible for it. He might\nadvance his reputation by a good\ntheory but a bad theory might also\ndestroy it. Even worse, a bad theory would distract the scientific community from 'real' work. The buck\nmust stop somewhere: the name\ntells us where this is.\nTheories which have their\ninventors' names also personal is e science; they human is e it. The general impression is of science as\nsome great, hulking machine. A bulldozer which advances steadily\nbut surely, wiping out all life in its\nway. But by saying that this part of\nthe machine comes from Einstein,\nthat from Turing, the process of science is made just that slightly more\naccessible. Indeed, popular biographies telling us that Einstein was a woman is er, that Turing was gay,\nonly add to this access ability. Science is no longer a machine\nwith, or even worse, without, its\nown mind. It is now made up of\npeoples' ideas.\nSamin\nWordIink by Astra\n\u2022\nn Fit the words in the list into the blank squares on the grid. Go on,\nit's easy.

In the FELIX article on the\nhacking into a system in\nBiochemistry, I am quoted as saying that CCS has \"managed to\nmake sure that nothing like that\nwill happen again\". What I actually said was that we had rebuilt\nthe system to try to make sure that\nnothing like that would happen\nagain. There are no absolute\nguarantees when it comes to computer security. Kerberos is indeed\na significant improvement in security terms, as Mr Sharp knows,\nsince he spent the summer working for CCS to investigate the possibilities for installing Kerberos\ncampus wide on the workstation\nclusters for which we are resp on si ble.

Our paranormal invest iga paranormal - ^fj j^^^^ chases whistles and groan\nHalloween - the name given to 31st October - is the\neve of All Saint's Day, when supernatural influences\nprevail and ghosts are out in force.\nNot surprisingly, given its roots of intrigue\nand strife, London is known for its haunted\nunderground stations, parks, theatres, police\nstations and even airport. Runway one at Heathrow\nis rumoured to be haunted with a bowler-hatted\nfigure waiting in vain to catch\nthat spirit plane.\nSome of the wandering\nsouls have evil intent, but many\nare simply spirits who haven't accepted their death. Some may\nbe sad and watch over the place\nthey loved. Many of the theatres\nin the West End, including the\nAdelphi, Albery, Coliseum,\nHaymarket, Sadlers Wells and\nthe Theatre Royal, are homes to\nthe souls of actors prematurely\ndeparted thanks to their jealous\ncolleagues. Present actors often\nclaim they can feel a ghostly\ninfluence on the stage. There's a tradition that if a ghost appears,\nthe production will be a success\nand launch its actors into an\nextraordinary acting career.\nOther kindly wraiths warn of\nimpending doom. A woman in\ngrey - thought to be Florence\nNightingale - walks through St\nThomas's Hospital. The Lady\nof the Lamp no longer\nsymbolises hope and if seen will\nprobably signify that\nGovernment closure is nigh.\nThe Tower of London,\nwith its gory past and ghostly\nchamber of\nGreen Park, one of the royal parks, used to be\na favourite spot for duellists in Elizabethan times.\nHowever, it is most famous for its haunted tree.\nDead Man's Tree (about 50 metres from Piccadilly,\nalmost in front of the Park Lane hotel) has been the\nscene of many suicides. Low, mocking laughs and\nstrange, groaning sounds can apparently be heard.\nFurther along, if you stop off at the Grenadier Pub\n(Hyde Park Corner) and see ghostly figures, don't blame the drink. This pub used to be the Officer's Mess for the Duke of Wellington's regiment. It's meant to be haunted by an officer who was\nmurdered for cheating at cards. Strange noises and\nraps are heard; the light and taps are mysteriously\nswitched on. Who knows, maybe you have drunk too\nmuch. Carry on walking, through exclusive\nKnightsbridge and into fashionable Chelsea.\nCheyne Walk has been home to many artists, poets,\nbohemians and a phantom bear -\u00bb perhaps the\nreproachful spectre of one killed by bear-baiting.\nFurther west is Hammersmith, popular with\nstudents and also the haunt of a woman in grey seen\nweeping day and night. Brevor Lodge used to be the\nheadquarters of a gang of coin ers until they were\nbetrayed and jailed. On release, they lured the\nwoman thought to be the informant into the lodge,\nand forced her to sew a sack in which she was\ndrowned by the murky waters of the Thames.\nBack in Kensington, the phantom bus is\nperhaps the most reported sighting. The number 7\nis sometimes seen after midnight, driving along\nCambridge Gardens all lit up without driver or\nconductor. At the junction with St Mark's Road, the\nbus dissolves into thin air. Apparently, this junction\nused to be dangerous and was the scene of many\naccidents. Since the road has been altered the bus\nhas not been seen. Perhaps it was a warning.\nCertainly all those who enter Holland House, now a youth hostel, should beware. This was once the\nhome of Henry Rich, the first earl of Holland. He\nwas beheaded by\nhorrors, is the \u00ab\\anc[ forced her tO SeW Cromwell during the\nsetting for many unhappy and vengeful Civil War and his\ndeeds.

His\nspirit is said to linger on, looking out of the\nwindows towards the weather vane.

    "content": "Incoming\nGlyph's friends defend...Mr Hynds on WWW and hack-ing...Poon wars...and some internal back-patting\nGlyph's Pint\nDear Felix,\nWe read and enjoyed \"The\nDocker's Fist\" by Glyph in this\nyear's inaugural Felix. We felt\nthat it was an eloquent and\nhumorous vilification of a lot of\nthe things that are wrong about\nthe social environment at IC.\nThough it may have been a bit\nover the top in places, Helen\nTeasdales's highly personal attack\non Glyph (Felix 1007, letters) was\nuncalled for. It was unfair of\nHelen to claim that Glyph's commentary dismissed the whole of\nIC's student population, when he\n(or she?) was concerned only with\nthose minorities of social misfits\nwhose presence has a sufficiently\nhigh profile within IC to substantially taint the social atmosphere.\nThough Helen claims ignorance\nof the identity of the \"anorak\nbrigade\", we're sure she must\nhave met them. They're those\nwhose only point of reference in\ndealing with other people are the\nmarks and grades attained during\ntheir courses here. They despise\nthose with marks lower than\ntheirs, and detest those who get\nhigher marks than they do.\nAgainst this background of hostile\ninsecurity, they are unable to constructively interact with anyone.\n[...]\nGlyph certainly did not attack\ntill the beer-drinking males of IC,\nonly that obscene fringe whose\nall-too-familiar drunken, brawling,\nviolent and abusive presence in\nthe Union Bar and Southside\nspoils the appeal of these places\nfor many people. While they may\nnot all be fat and bearded, bigoted they most certainly are. Helen\nhas obviously not had to confront\ninebriated louts in the Union\nattempting to pick a fight simply\nbecause the group she was in\nincluded an Oriental guy they\nchose to make the butt of racist\n\"karate kid\" and \"slant eye\" insults.\nThese people are a major reason\nfor the lack of an overseas presence in the Union bar and events.\nSufficient evidence for the prevailing bigotry is also provided by the\ntotal lack of gay and lesbian social\nactivity at IC.\nTry as we might, we failed to\nfind the \"Don't do Rag, it'll turn\nyou gay\" message Helen claims is\nso obvious in Glyph's article.\nQuite the contrary, it seemed to us\nthat Glyph was claiming that at\nfirst sight, the fact that the last two\nRag chairs have been lesbians (this\nis the correct grammar to use, by\nthe way) would seem to add to the\nappeal of Rag.\nAs Glyph wrote, the occasional\nbit of noisy fun is harmless in\nitself. It's when people confuse\nhaving fun with making a nuisance of themselves, an IC trade-mark, that objection can be raised.\n[...]\nIf Helen doesn't understand\nhow having it known around IC\nthat one is in a relationship can\nsometimes appear to be a fate\nworse than death, she's obviously\nnot had any of the sexually\ndeprived pathetic little geeks of\nwhom there is also a substantial\nfringe around here make disgusting innuendo about a relationship\nshe was involved in. And she's also obviously not been harrassed\nby muscle-bound idiots making\nstupid comments about her sexual\npreferences and/or performance\njust because she'd never bragged\nabout how many people of the\nopposite sex she could get into the\nunderwear of in one night after a dozen pints at the Union[...].\nHelen also failed to understand\nthe self-deprecating humour in\nGlyph's line about the dangers of\ndelusion on his part in thinking\nthat he is the only \"wistful and\nenigmatic\" exception to the rule.\nThere are a lot of things wrong\nabout the IC environment, but one\nof the good things is that there\nseem to be a few people capable\nof laughing at themselves. More\nthan anything else, we are\nalarmed by the sterile rigidity of\nthose totally convinced of the\nabsolute rectitude of their micro-fascist little doctrines. Helen ends\nby supercilious ly stating that Glyph\nfully deserves the social isolation\nshe groundlessly assumes he finds\nhimself in. In her ideal world, pre-sum ably, she could condemn anyone she wished to the status of\nsocial pariah, but fortunately, no\nsuch moral and social fota lit arian ist autocracy prevails or, if we can\nhelp it, will prevail.\nFinally, if Glyph would like to\nmake him (or her) self known to\nus, we'd be delighted to congratulate them in person and invite\nthem to a few rounds of their\nfavourite drink.\nYours etc,\nXavier Arcenegui-Siemens,\nGeorge Karaolides,\nBenjamin D. Wandelt,\nBlackett Laboratory,\nDepartment of Physics\n/ myself thought that Glyph's piece was slow but humourous and\nenjoyable, and so support your letter in his/her defence. Your points\nabout people not being able to\nlaugh at themselves and working\nunder rigid doctrines are very pertinent. In fact, if you think about it,\nmost of the IC categories that\nyou've bought up (\"anoraks\",\n\"beer drinkers\", etc) suffer from\nthis malaise. Does anyone have\nany antidotes for this disease?\nI also agree with your interpretation, over Helen Teasdale's, of\nGlyph's ideas on Rag and gays. To\nGlyph, gay is trendy and people\njoin Rag because they think it's trendy.\nApologies for the editing of your\nletter: Mr Bennallack's space rules!\nOfficial WWW\nDear Mr. Bennallack,\nNo doubt some of the readers\nof the S File in the edition of 14th. of October will be relieved to\nknow that it will not be necessary\nfor the Rector to bang heads\ntogether to obtain a College policy\non the use of World Wide Web\n(WWW). In the spring of this year\nthe Centre for Computing Services\ninitiated discussions with\nAcademic departments, the Library\nand the Administration on the\ndevelopment of a Campus Wide\nInformation System (CWIS) for\nImperial College. This led to a strategy paper being presented to\nthe College Computing Policy\nCommittee in May. The\nCommittee made recommendations to the Rector based on the\nEdited this week\nby Samin Ishtiaq,\nComputing IV\npaper, particularly with regard to\nthe development of WWW systems\non campus. The Rector responded\nby asking for Code of Conduct for\nthe operation of WWW systems to\nbe drawn up and presented to the\nHeads of Departments meeting in\nJune. The Code was accepted and\nis now being used to provide\nguidelines for the operation of the\nsignificant number (11 plus) of\nWWW systems on campus.\nIn essence the Code requires\nthe Head of Department to be\nresponsible for all the material\nthat is displayed by WWW systems\nin a department, and so will lead\nto appropriate procedures for vetting information mounted by the\ndepartment. The Centre has\noffered the Union the facility to\nhave a Union section on the central College WWW system, with\nthe proviso that the President of\nthe Union must accept full responsibility for any material mounted.\nI understand that the Union is\nconsidering how best to make\nthese WWW facilities available to\nclubs and societies while observing\nthe necessary constraints.\nI'm sure that Dr. Harrison will\nbe delighted to know that the\nCentre, the Marketing Department\nand the Registry have been working closely together to mount the\nCollege PG prospectus on the central College WWW, and that this is\njust a first step in a closely co-ordinated effort to present an attractive and very positive image of\nImperial College to the Internet.\nYours sincerely,\nR.J. Hynds\nHead of Centre for Computing\nServices\nDespite it's tortuous generation,\n(I couldn't keep a straight face\nthrough all those committees and\nstrategies) College's policy on\nWWW is not good enough for its\nstudents. Many Departments still do\nnot allow home pages, for exam-ple, excusing themselves with\nlegal i ties. And the College's home\npage is really bad compared to,\nsay, MIT's. MM FELIX3 I0CT91 "

It was\nattended by dignitaries such as\nthe Professor Tim Shaw, Dean\nof the RSM, and Professor Mike\nWorthington, Head of Geology.\nThe miners, coming from\npre-dinner drinks at the Union\nBar, had been looking forward\nto a pleasant evening in\nSherfield's Senior Common\nRoom.\nHowever, as the evening\nprogressed, many of those\nattending became slightly\ndrunk. Observers have\ndescribed scenes of intoxication,\nstudents vomiting and throwing\nfood, and widespread spiking of\ndrinks.\nAfter one person vomited,\nMr Vinod Fernandez, RSMU\nPresident, was told by one of\nthe catering staff that should\nthings worsen, Catering would\nstop the dinner. Later, whilst\nthe diners were enjoying\ndessert, the catering section was\nshut down and locked up. When\nbemused miners queried the\naction, Mr Fernandez was told\nto take any complaints to a higher authority.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Simon\nWesterman, IC Catering\nManager, said that it is required\nof all licensees that they do not\nserve intoxicated customers.\n\"My staff feared for their own\nsafety in view of the level of\ndrunkenness and they are not\nprepared to honour any future\nRSM bookings ... they are\nemployed as caterers, not vomit\ncleaners.\"\nHowever, Mr Fernandez\ndenied any reprehensible behaviour on the part of the miners.\n\"We've always had dinners\nin Sherfield, and this was far\ntamer than in previous years.\nThey knew what they were letting themselves in for. We made\nsure that it was quieter [than in\nprevious years] and my VicePresident, Hon Sec and myself\nstayed behind for an hour clearing up the mess which was over\nand above a reasonable amount.\"\nAt last year's dinner, a fresher got so drunk he had to be carried home by friends, and he\nlater fell out of a third floor window ( FELIX977). Fundamental\nDifferences\nBY DAVID COHEN\nMuslim extremists have once\nagain caught the attention of the\nLondon student arena.\nIn recent weeks a group\ncalled Hizb u Tahrir were\nreported to have been\ndistributing leaflets of an anti-homosexual and anti-Semitic\nnature in and around the\nUniversity of London Union\n(ULU) premises. An incident\nalso occurred at the Kings\nCollege fresher s' fair, where a group was asked to leave\nfollowing the identification of\none of its members as a Hizb u Tahrir activist. The group left\npeacefully.\nLast Wednesday evening the\nUL U Council passed a motion\nre-enforcing its \"stance against\nbigotry and prejudice from any\nsource\".\nThe resolutions passed at the\nGUC meeting state that: GUC\nrefuses to allow distribution of\nliterature which breaks the UL U constitution (which can be\ninferred from the constitution\nitself).

    "content": "Clubs o Societies News\nStorming Success\nThis Saturday saw the first Rag Raid of the\nyear, to Canterbury. We arrived at the historic and beautiful city of Canterbury and\nfound it most definitely \"Pissing it down\".\nHowever, we bravely grabbed our cans and\nleapt out of the minibus into the city centre\nand started to use every trick in the book to\npersuade unfortunate shoppers and tourists to\npart with their hard earned cash. One particularly enterprising pair raised a fortune, collecting for Brain Injured Children, outside\nMothercare and say they had an exceptionally\ngood response from expectant mothers.\nA few hours and several pubs later we\nheaded up to the University of Kent. Our\nappearance here was very popular, and one\nsecurity guard commented on the number of\npeople who had phoned him up to comment\non our exemplary behaviour. Oh and we most\ndefinitely did not nick any signs.\nWe finally returned to the Union after an\nexcellent Mystery Tour of South London.\nOverall the day was a great success with\neveryone having a great time and collecting\nsuperbly. During the day we raised the staggering sum of \u00a3547.16 for B. LB.I.C.( British\nInstitute for Brain Injured Children), with\nthe top collector being Jon Lambert, who\nraised the unbelievable sum of \u00a3120.33.\nBungee Jumps\nWould you like to Bungee jump for free?\nThen drop into the Rag Office any lunch\ntime, or come to the Rag meeting at 1.10pm today. The initial cost is \u00a344 pounds but by\nRaising just \u00a388 in sponsor money (it's a lot\neasier than you may think,) for the Cancer\ncharity Tenovus you can jump for free. And if\nyou can't raise that much don't worry as 50%\nof what you do raise will be reduced from the\ncost of the jump. The jump will take place at\nthe London Docklands on Sunday 20th November. So if you fancy experiencing the\nmost fun you can have with a heavy duty elastic band then sign up today.\nSponsored Kamikaze Parachute Jump\nThis is where a number of people jump out of\na minibus outside Harrods wearing nothing\nbut their shoes and try and make it back to\ncollege. This is usually done as quickly as\npossible but for the really daring amongst you\nthere will be a prize for the last one back. A couple of years ago we had a female student\ndo the jump for the first time, and this year\nwe should have several people taking part for\na second time, so it can't be all that bad. So if\nyou fancy taking part come and see us.\nTrick or Treating\nTomorrow sees the next event in the Rag calendar Trick or Treating in Covent Garden for\nSENSE (the National Deaf-Blind and Rubella\nAssociation). Jez (the R. C.S.U. Fire Engine)\nwill be going along, and there will be prizes\nof a liquid kind for best fancy dress and top\ncollectors, as well as McDonalds vouchers for\neveryone who takes part. So use your imaginations to think up some original and bizarre\nFancy Dress costumes and meet us in Beit\nQuad at 9.30am tomorrow morning, or in\nCovent Garden during the day.\nDon't forget to come to the Rag meeting in\nthe Union lounge (opposite Da Vinci's) at 1.10pm this lunch time.\nICSF: The Prisoner\nOn Tuesday l st November, ics f is pleased to\npresent Dave Lally. Dave is an active member\nof The Prisoner Fan Club - 6 Ofl, and a frequent visitor to 'The Village' - Portmeiron,\nWales. He has given talks on The Prisoner\ndozens of times, and has been known to bring\nalong a Rover (one of those big not-terribly-scary balloon y things) on occasion.\nFor those of you who think that The\nPrisoner is something to do with an\nAustralian women's jail, you've been watching the wrong TV show. The Prisoner was\n(is) a cult British TV series which starred\nPatrick McGoohan as an ex-spy. Most of the\nepisodes involve Number Two trying to find\nout why Number Six (Patrick McGoohan)\nresigned from his job, while Number Six\nspends his time trying to escape. Plenty of\naction tinged with paranoia.\nThe evening's events will start at 7.00pm with a showing of a great episode called \"The\nSchizoid Man\". Dave's got an interesting talk\nand film show planned; he'll be speculating\non the forthcoming film, showing rare\n\"Making of The Prisoner\" footage and other\nsnippets of Prisoner trivia.\nEntrance is free to everyone.\nFilmSoc\nReservoir Dogs, Sirens and Flintstones\nThis week ICU Cinema is full of favourites,\nnew and old. First up on Saturday is that\n\"pumping powerhouse of a movie\", Reservoir\nDogs. This film is one that everyone should\nbe familiar with but if you haven't even heard\nof it, now is the time to sit up and be counted.\nYes, you too can have a complete life - all you\nhave to do is come along at 8.00pm or\n11.00pm on Saturday. The Sirens will be\nsounding at 8.00pm on Sunday with Hugh\nGrant not knowing where to look, or more to\nthe point what to look at. Last but not least\nthis week is the Flintstones (Thursday at\n8.00pm) Bedrock has been unavoidable this\nsummer. The climate may be cooling down\nnow but we offer you the chance to relive\nyour summer, and now you can even buy an\nice cream from us as well.\nOperatic Society\n\"It Came From Budleigh Salterton\"\nMany books have been written and many\nfilms made based on stories about strange\ncreatures visiting planet Earth. If contact was\nto be made, would they be coming as friends\nor enemies? What's more, who's to say that\nthey are not with us already? When sitting in\na lecture theatre amidst a hundred people on\na Friday morning, think a bit how much you\nreally know about the person sitting next to\nyou...\nSurprisingly enough, there's a major\nentertainment value to be had by this morbid\nand spooky background, and it's there for you\nto discover in our next glorious production:\nmore than just a Fresher's Event, in full\nTechnicolor and, able to be seen with both\neyes at the same time. OpSoc presents a world\npremier: \"It Came from Budleigh Salterton\"!\nIt is basically a rock'n 'roll rip-off of those\n(not quite) science fiction movies of the 50's and 60's and it loosely based around...well, all\nof them really. Everyone who wishes to take\npart is welcome; there will be a weekend\nworkshop held on Saturday the 5th and\nSunday the 6th of November (Union Concert\nHall, 11.00am), with the performance taking\nplace on Monday the 7th( same place, 8pm). For further information please contact\nMarlain Angelides (BioChem 2) or leave a message in the OpSoc pigeonhole the union office.\nFine Arts Course\nThe Leonardo Fine Arts Society was born\nlast December. It is open to all students and\nstaff who want to spend a couple of hours a week exploring their creativity. Our teachers\nare postgraduate students at the Royal\nCollege of Art. The atmosphere is relaxed and\nenthusiastic. You can use any of our expanding range of materials, including charcoal and\nacrylic paints; or bring your own. Last year\nwe had a few special classes, this year we will\nhold more, on arts as diverse as glass blowing\nand origami. The society is young and still\nhas its rebellious adolescent phase to go\nthrough. So come along and watch your\ndrawings and painting improve.\nYou can contact Leonardo Society either\nthrough the pigeon holes at the union or at one of\nthe classes. Classes are held in Room 101, Civil\nEngineering from 6.30 to 8.30 on Tuesdays and\nThursdays. Membership is \u00a33 for students and \u00a36\nfor others. Classes are \u00a32.\nLord Soper at IC\nRadical politics from a ninety-two year old?\nFor most of his life, Donald Soper has been a great advocate of Christian socialism, speaking out both in public, and in the House of\nLords. He appears every Sunday at Speaker's corner, and has done so for well over half a century. He is coming to speak to students on\nThursday November 3rd at 6.00pm in Mech\nEng 213. This event is organised by the IC\nChaplaincies. Refreshments will be served\nafterwards to provide a chance for us to talk\nto each other, and to meet with Lord Soper in\nan informal environment.\n3I0CT91 FELIX HQ "

    "content": "Standby\ndeeply sunk into addiction, harsh religion and crazy geeks\nA girl, with a guitar, and a bottle of\ncheap red wine; guzzled greedily\nbetween highs of a curious kind.\nIsabel from Drugstore is having\nfun, playing to the crowd (or is that\nplaying with?). The rest is dressing,\nthough necessary in a sugar-coated,\nindie pop-placebo kinda way. It's Isabel's breathy vocals that give us\nthe rush we really need: laced with\nstreet-corner seductive ness and\ndelivered with a knowing poise.\nSongs like 'Fader' and 'Gravity'\nwork their way into our veins; a dreamy melancholy that stays with\nus long after the magical high of the\nmoment. Drugstore are an\nunsettling, intoxicating band, a habit\nI never want to kick.\nIt's later, and the Kitchens of\nDistinction amble onto stage like\nold friends - no need to impress, we\nalready know what we're getting,\nand we'd hate to have anything\nmore. Even the abundance of new\nsongs (well, they do have an album\nto promote after all) doesn't detract\nfrom the joy of familiar pleasures:\nthe Kitchens' brand of guitar-pop,\nwith its controlled loss of focus and\nfrenetic energy, is as gorgeous as\never. On the downside, Julian and\nco were maybe a little too laid-back\nto really blow me away, but their\nnew material - played with broader\nbrush strokes than on record - was\nmore than good enough to satisfy.\nDamn fine stuff.\nAccording to a certain spiky\nhaired, goatee d, cartoon character,\nex-music editor, The Cult are an\nobject of ridicule. The point is that\nthat is not the point - they've always\nbeen a band to enjoy whether when\nlaughing at their wayward rock\nhistrionics or simply marvelling at\nthe an the mic quality of their songs.\nOkay, so they lost the plot with\n'Ceremony' but with this\neponymous ly titled album they've\nmetamorphosis ed into a raw,\nserious and thankfully still\nthoroughly exciting outfit for the\n'90s. Opener 'Gone' slams down the\nnew Cult manifesto in\nuncompromising fashion. A throbbing bass-line, scampering\ndrum beat and jazzy piano collide\ninto a visceral chorus of intent full of\nthose scorching Duffy-ta stic guitar\nriffs and the former 'Wolfchild'\nAstbury uttering profanities for all\nhe's worth. In fact, there's a newly\ndeveloped rhythmic presence\nrunning through all the songs (could\nwe please keep this drummer?),\nsomething which takes intense\npieces like current single 'Coming\nDown' and makes them, well,\ndance able to. It's not all adrenal is ed stuff though. There's the restrained\npower of 'Black Sun', a reference to\nAstbury's child abuse, and the\nbeautiful acoustic tones of 'Sacred\nLife' which laments the loss of icons\nsuch as River Phoenix and Kurt\nCobain. But we can't end on a serious note. I 'll leave you with a few words of wisdom from the\nrocking, 'Be Free': \"Don't eat sh*t, if\nyou wanna stay fit.\" ... Try not to\nenjoy it. (8)\nDub War opened up with a air-raid siren blast, which sure got\nthe crowd's attention. Alas, the\ninterest barely lasted through their\nfirst song, after which it became\nincreasingly clear they only had one\nsong. Billed as a radical mix of dub,\nrock, rag ga and bavarian folk music\n(spot the deliberate mistake), DubWar totally fail to make the most of\ntheir influences, drowning out any\nsubtleties with a head-on assault of\npounding drums and screeching\nguitars. They made a half-hour set\nsound monotonous, though their\nlast song, 'Mental', showed some\npotential. But one good song does\nnot a band make...\nBlaggers ITA can't be accused\nof having only one song. They have\ntwo: the loud, stomp-along anthem,\nand the loud, stomp-along anthem\nwith a quieter bit in the middle. Such\nversatility should be applauded, as\nshould the Blagger's self-sacrificing\nresponse to the Government's Care\nin the Community policy. At least, I assume the guy doing aeroplane\nimpressions and occasionally\nshouting things at the audience\nwas a refugee from some shutdown loony bin. I mean, they\nalready have one singer, so letting\nthis guy on stage must have been\nan act of charity, right? Still, they\nwere a massive improvement on\nDub-War, and I ended up quite\nenjoying their set. Nothing special,\nbut fun to watch, if only for the\nhilarious double-think apparent in\ndenouncing the Criminal Justice Bill\none minute, only to exhort the\nmasses to rush out and buy their\nnew single the next. Who's selling\nout now?\nYou don't need to listen to Lisa\nGermano's second al hum, 'geek\nthe girl', for very long before you.\nrealise that the geek in question is\nLisa herself. It's more than just the\nfact that Lisa's character shines\nthroughout her music, rather it's the\ntwist on the wry self effacing quality\nwhich increasingly starts to haunts\nus.\nWhen she sings \"we are learning\nmuch about evil\" in the first song\n'my secret reason', it's a statement\nof intent for what is to come. After\nthe edgy experiences offered by\nskewed folk violins of 'phantom\nlove' and '...a psychopath' it's time\nto reach for the phone just to hear\nanother human voice\\ Yet even\nghost-trains must finish and with\nthe warming night breezes offered\nby 'a guy like you' and the delicate\nbeauty of last track, 'stars', we're\nback from any proffered brinks. Lisa\nends by singing \"\nI love my man\"\nand I guess that's what we're all\naiming for. (7) 0\nQ thin-line Japanese style\nAmidst the slick and shiny return to glitz this season, the opening of\na new branch of Muji on High St Ken comes as a breath of fresh air.\nMuji means \"no [brand] name\" and signifies their minimalist\napproach - pure lines, simple shapes and neutral tones. To really\ntake centre stage at the Christmas parties this year, the key will be\nnot to out glam( almost impossible this season) but to out style in\nunderstated pure lined simplicity. Clothes by Zoran Ladicobic, king of\nminimalism, are described by their buyer at Browns as being for\n\"women who don't feel the need to disguise themselves with what\nthey wear but prefer to let their personality make the statement\". For\nthose of us with less well lined pockets Muji is the closest we'll get.\nGood cut is essential, and bear in mind this season's shape is long\nand lean. Ideal simplistic dressing this winter is found in A line shifts\neither skimming the knee or to the floor. Choose soft, gently clinging\nmaterials and contrast with glossy hair and accessories.\nit Paul Smith has opened a new jeans shop this month at 9-11\nLangley street.

    "content": "News and Editorial\nForeign Affairs\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nAfter as ham boli c start to the\nyear, the Overseas Students\nCommittee has managed to\nassemble and has had its first\nchairmen and treasurers meeting.\nIntended as an umbrella\norganisation to coordinate the\nindividual overseas clubs and\nsocieties, the committee was\nunable to convene earlier as it\nstarted the term with only one\nelected member. The elections\nfor this year's posts were held last\nterm but resulted in only the\nChairman, Andreas Mershin,\nbeing voted in. The rest of the\npositions went to New Election.\nMershin said he was put in\nan 'impossible' position, blaming\nthe timing of the elections.\nThough all the posts are now\nfilled, only the position of\nTreasurer was contested at the\nelections on October 19th. Mershin admitted disappointment with the turnout at the\nvoting, but felt more encouraged\nafter the first meeting's proceedings - despite spending\nmuch of the time discussing basic\norganisation when it is already\nthe fourth week of term.\nThe committee represents 25\ndifferent societies, but less than\nhalf that number were present at\nthe meeting. Mershin said the\nattendance was 'good for this sort\nof thing' and that, compared to\nthe turnout at Union General\nMeetings, Imperial's Overseas\nStudents looked fairly\nenthusiastic. Referring to the size\nof IC's overseas student\npopulation he spoke of the apathy\nthat seems to be symptomatic of\nbeing at Imperial: \"I'm representing 2,500 people who\ndon't know I'm representing\nthem.\" However, nothing has as\nyet been organised; this term's disco was originally planned as a fresher s' event - it is now\nscheduled for 'sometime in\nNovember'.\nIC Russellers\nBY ANDREW DORMAN\nIt has emerged that the Russell\nGroup, representing the elite\nuniversities, was started at\nImperial College. Sir Eric Ash,\nthe former Rector of Imperial, has\ntold FELIX that he invited the\nVice-Chancellors of the top five\nresearch universities to discuss\nsimilar needs on the subject of\nresearch income.\nDr David Thomas, the ProRector (Research Contracts), has\nconfirmed that it was his idea to\nset up the 'Group of Five'di to riaLA FELIX-less Friday and a Magazined Monday\nThe observant readers amongst\nyou have probably noticed that\nthis FELIX has arrived on\nMonday - as opposed to you just\nbeing lucky enough to find an\nuntouched pile of 300 copies\nleftover from Friday (LS readers\nplease ignore and carry on as you\nwere - hee hee hee hee). This was due to the\ninstallation of new litho\nequipment in the Print Unit and\nthe subsequent loss of a days\nprinting time. We couldn't begin\nto produce pages until Thursday:\nfar too late to allow FELIX to\ncome out before Saturday. But\nthe pages you are reading now\nwere rolled out by the new press\nwhich hopefully bodes well. I'd like to thank to Andy T. for his\nwork in securing the new litho -your filo fax is in the post...\nconsisting of Oxford, Cambridge,\nWarwick, UCL and IC - which\nfirst met in late 1989. It was set\nup to stop industry gaining\nintellectual property rights to\nresearch which they had only\npartly funded. The group\nformulated agreed policy in\ndealing with industry, and\nlobbied Ministers. According to\nDr Thomas it was largely\nsuccessful. While the group\noriginally restricted membership\nto the five, after Sir Eric's departure as Rector, the numbers\nincreased to the present eighteen\nCaptain, my Captain\nThere are of course a great many\npeople behind each issue of this\nnewspaper and as with many\nthings it is often only the loudest\nwho are credited. But this week I have to doff my cap to Jon Jordan\nfor taking the helm whilst I graduated and balled yesterday\n(and this morning). He saw most\nof the magazine to print and\nrather than talk about\nCommemoration Day as I had\nplanned to (before the alcohol\nstrewn affair actually happened)\nI 'll leave the final words this\nweek to him. Take it away JJ...\nOwain\n...once again the editor\nnegates all responsibilities and\nwanders around London, staring\nintently at the bright lights\nwhilst quaffing back large\namounts from half empty wine\nbottles. But looking at his pale\nface when he eventually straggled\nin this morning I knew that, as\neditor-for-the-day I had had the\nmembers.\nIn an interview with FELIX, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, the present\nRector, said that the present\ngroup is a caucus of \"larger\ninstitutions whose research is a large element of their funding\".\nSir Ronald dismissed claims\nof a breakaway suggesting\n'sensational journalism' had\nexaggerated the story. He\ninsisted that the group wanted to\ndemonstrate the merits of the\npresent system of selective\nfunding by lobbying top\npoliticians, civil servants and\nbusinessmen. The Rector\npointed out that the Russell\nGroup is only one of over half a dozen associations whose\nbetter deal. There are few times\nthat I have seen Owain stressed\nout but last Thursday was one .\nI remember watching the\nproud parents dutifully following\ntheir pro genies around college on\ncom mem day. Part of me wanted\nto be there with them too, not\nleast because that would mean\nthat my degree was over. My\nremaining parts wanted to be\nthere as well, not least to be\nwearing a long, black gown and\nrun around anarchistic ally pretending to be Batman.\nIn time I did go through\nthese rites of passage and\nemerged out the other side as an\nofficial graduate of Imperial\nCollege. And as with many other\nthings in life I realised that the\nwhole event had been a sham.\nJust as one of the 'best scientific\neducations' had ultimately\nproved to be of little value so the\ncrowning day of that education\nwas revealed as boring, full of\npomp and show and ultimately\nsignifying nothing. jon\nmembership overlaps. He also\npointed out that there is no way\nto opt out of the funding system,\nand that the group's main aim is\nto protect research funding levels.\nMeanwhile the London\nSchool of Economics (LSE)\nStudents' Union has initiated\nwhat it calls the 'Aldwych Group'\nto protect student interests in\nwhat it sees as a future 'Ivy\nLeague'. In its first meeting the\ngroup discussed the implications\nof the Russell Group. Those\nattending included senior\nStudent Union officials of ULU,\nLSE, Cambridge and Imperial. Its\nnext meeting is to be held at\nImperial on 1st November.\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nAssistant Editor Jon Jordan\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Helen Randall\nEditorial Team\nArt 8, Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox\nMusic Vik Bansal\nNews Andrew Tseng & Mike Ingram\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nS Flles Tim Parsons\nSeven Day Guide Wei Lee, Liz Cady & Ivan Chan\nSport Juliette Decock and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week\nMark Immel, Patrick Wood, Jon Jordan,\nSphinx&Penguin, Joe McFadden\nHelpfulness Tim St. Clore, Steven&Simon\nSTOP PRESS RAG STOP PRESS\nThe Rag collection at David Copperfield\nis off, apparently as DC believes the\nr aggies are actually rival magicians\nspying on the great one!\n3I0CT91 FELIX WM\n\n"
