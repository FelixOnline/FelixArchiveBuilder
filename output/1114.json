    "content": "8 May 1998\nMORE THEATRE ARTS\nTHE REAL INSPECTOR HOUND & BLACK COMEDY\nComedy Theatre\n\"I 'll kill you for this, Simon\nGascoigne!\"\nAnna Chancellor as Lady Muldoon\nIt could be said that both these plays lack ec lat, and show a complete disregard for elan. It is true, however, that they represent an entire generation, and express the\ndissatisfaction of ad is embo died society. The first of these plays, The\nReal Inspector Hound, is a glorious Tom Stoppard satire on critics and critics m, with the\ndialogue alternating between the philandering critics in the\naudience and the first night of\nthe play they' ve come to\nreview. This play within a play\nis an Agatha Christie pastiche, and it becomes clear that all is\nnot as it seems, especially as\nthe critics are dragged into the\nplay, and the actors take over the role of the critics. Wonderful moments include Lady Muldoon in a cocktail dress, high heels and perfectly arranged stockings, coming in\nthrough the French windows, having obviously just finished a game of tennis, Mrs Drudge switching on the radio to hear\na police warning about a madman, believed to be a tall\nyoung man in a grey suit\nbehaving suspiciously in the\nneighbourhood, and a tall\nyoung man in a grey suit,\nbehaving suspiciously, entering through the French windows as\nshe stands there with her\nmouth open, and the body, which lies on the floor and is\nignored by the entire comp a ny, until the police inspector points it out to them. The play is extremely surreal in parts, but due to the wit and brill i ance of the writing remains extremely funny. The plot is\nalmost impossible to describe;1 can only say that it is conf us ing, cunning and comic. Black Comedy, the second play, is a rarely performed farce from the Sixties, where the familiar of light and dark\nare reversed: when the actors can see, we cannot, when a fuse blows onstage, the theatre is suddenly floodlit. Again the plot is almost totally indescribable, descending as it\ndoes into complete farce. In\nessence, it involves an artist\nand his fiancee who are unable to marry unless her military father gives his permission. He will only do this of the artist\ncan sell his sculptures to an\neccentric and profoundly deaf millionaire. Add to this as pi nster discovering alcohol, and extremely camp neighbour and a German philosopher working as an electrician, and you have\na sparkling witty farce. DidI mention the ex girlfriend who returns to cause havoc? Both plays have the same cast, featuring Duck face from Four Weddings and A Funeral( Anna Chancellor), the blonde Philadelphia girl (Sarah\nCrowe), someone who looks astonishingly like a friend of\nmine and an actor who you' ll recognise and, if you' re like\nme, will be absolutely unable\nto place. They' re all extremely good, and fit the dual roles\nthey have to play. Both plays had meal most crying with laughter, and are well worth going to see. The theatre is\ngorgeous as well, one of those little London theatres with more space inside than you' d believe possible from the\nfacade. Hurry up and get your tickets, the run ends in twelve weeks. Julia H SAUCY JACK AND THE SPACE VIXENS\nQueen's Theatre\nBefore the show started we were anticipating something\ntruly cosmic, as we were\npresented with a scene of stars and\nspaceships. The programme came with a glossary of terms, which was\nfull of outrageous humour, and\npromised a 'post modern musical\nwhich raised an intergalactic fist up\nat convention.'\nWhat we got, however, was a cross between a tame version of\nthe Rocky Horror Show and Forbidden Planet that didn't really\nwork. The story was partly narrated\nby an 'intergalactic' psychoanalyst,\na frequenter of Saucy Jack's, a seedy bar where several cabaret\nartists have recently been murdered by the Slingback Killer, an\nelusive character whose weapon is\na sequin ned stiletto.\nTo the rescue come the apparently telepathic Space Vixens, three\nsassy disco divas who get a little\ndistracted from the job in hand\n(ahem) by handsome young men/women. Through a stroke of\nluck, one of the Space Vixens finds\nout who the killer is, and the repercussions of this change the lives of\nall the characters.\nThe stellar landscape was replaced by a cluttered and supposedly sleazy bar that bore little\nrelevance to space and remained\nthe only scenery used throughout\nthe rest of the show. Once it found\nits feet, the music was well per-formed, funky and modern (in clu d ing an excellence sax solo) with a refreshingly unsentimental and\nunrefined feel.\nThe most memorable chara c ter, Booby, the dreamy waitress\nplayed by a man (David Ashley)\nwas the only really convincing character although the others, while\ngenerally not making an impression\nwere at times very entertaining and\nenergetic. Ashley's part was not\noveracted and he made the character immediately likeable.\nThe story line, while light-heart-ed ly kinky, was simple and yet not\nclearly portrayed,making it surprisingly hard to follow. Although in\nparts very amusing, the majority of\nthe humour was cheap, 'Carry-On'\nstyle innuendo, making it seem less\nsentimental than most West-End\nmusicals, but it still lacked originality - we'd heard it all before.\nThey did feel, however, that it\nwas necessary to include the standard recipe of boy/girl meets boy/girl (pick a combination) by\npairing off everyone at the end,\napparently merely to add some resolution to the thin plot. One of the\ncharacters that was killed even\ncame back to life so that the vixen,\nBunny wouldn't be left alone.\nTwo out of the four couples\nwere homosexual which added to\nthe quirky and camp atmosphere,\nespecially since the two men 'came\nout' as plastic fetishists half way\nthrough. Perhaps better suited to\nits original format as a fringe show in the Edinburgh Festival, we found\nthat it didn't quite succeed in the\nWest End and that it lacked sub-stance. As a bit of fun, however,\nyou'd be hard pressed to find anything trashier. Its main virtue was\nthe music and the costumes too\nwere impressive (sci-fi/trendy).\nWe reckon 6/10.\nJudith and Christian\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUMS MUSIC 8 May 1998\nMONEY MARK\nPush the Button\nMoney Mark\nafter banging\nhis keyboards\nbrainless.\nT; hose hammering and chiselling carpenters aren't famous for their musical ability. Not unless their name is Karen\nor Richard. Or not unless they were\nthe singing sensation that was Jesus Christ Superstar, who learnt\nall he knew from his carpenter dad.\nBut you get my point: a carpenter is\nunlikely to change the sphere of\nmusic. However, what if you were\ncarpenter to The Beastie Boys? And they took a shine to your secret\npassion in analogue keyboard\ntweaking? And you went on to play\non their records and steer them\ntowards their current cool-standing\nas leaders of America's alternative\nscene? Well, you' d be Money Mark.\nMark Ramos-Nishita (renamed\nMoney Mark by The Beastie Boys)\nis a half-Mexican, half-Japanese\nlover of old technology. He says of\nhis primitive keyboards, \"It's something I can repair on my own, that's what I feel most comfortable\nabout. I have little relationships\nwith my keyboards.\" This is just\none factor that has made him steer\nclear of the digital revolution, \"It's hard for me to deal with this new\nworld, this new technology.\"\nJustifiably, then, his music is of a definite \" l of i\" nature. He gets\nimmense pleasure out of creating\nstrange new sounds and incorporating them into his songs. Even\nthis new album arrives in suitably\nlo-fi packaging, using the bare minimum of cardboard and plastic.\nYou've most probably heard of\nMoney Mark from his recent single,\nthe wonderful (yet strangely Top\n40-shy) Hand In Your Head. This\ntrack manages to mix bouncing\nrhythm, goodtime keyboard\nchords and assured, enticing\nsinging with lyrics which are inventive whilst still naive. In short, a surprising feel-good pop record. It\neven features Sean \"Son of John\"\nLennon on bass guitar, Mark's only\ncollaboration on the album.\nWhile few, if any, tracks on\nPush The Button are as amazing as\nHand In Your Head, the album is littered with magic moments. There\nare enough experimental pieces,\nlike the title track and the space\ninvaders march of Destroyer, to\nsatisfy any doubters of Money Mark's inventiveness. But it is the\n\"proper\" songs that steal the show.\nToo Like You is a well-crafted tune\nthat can be placed alongside any\nslice of '60's beat pop. The\neuphoric Tomorrow Will Be Like\nToday reprises Elvis Costello. And Rock In The Rain and / Don't Play\nPiano are heartfelt odes filled with\nlilting melodies.\nNo one was expecting this from\nMoney Mark. A collection of quirky\nsamples would have satisfied most.\nBut this album contains diverse\nsongs filled with the so-called\n\"hum\" factor - you can't get the\ncatchy tunes out of your head. Like\nthe lounge lizard cry of \"All the\npeople in the world!\"; or the\nstrained, driving bassline in forth-coming single Maybe I'm Dead; or\nthe awesome concoction that is\nPowerhouse: on the surface organ-led drum' n' bass mayhem, but\nbeneath that a carnival of boss a nova.\nFor what is his first proper studio album (previous efforts were\ndemos of age-old compositions)\nMoney Mark has made a remarkable achievement. He even found\nhimself a singing voice - reserved\nand un forced. The sheer experimentation of this album may initially put some off, but a few listens\nand you're drawn in. d Ed\nFRANK BLACK AND THE GANG STARR\nCATHOLICS Moment Of Truth gT T'r' ri Frank Black And The Catholics * *\nF rank Black, former lead singer\nof the highly acclaimed Pixies\nhas finally gone solo for the\nfourth time, 'Hurrah' I hear you shout. This supposedly blues\nalbum is meant to take over where\nthe Pixies left off, sounding fresher\nand more modern, but manages to\nbomb out.\nThis album has been produced\nalmost on auto pilot, every song is\nuninspired and seems to be trying\nto just tap into what the Pixies\nonce had, but as a result just\nsounds rehashed, predictable and\nunoriginal. The album was recorded over a space of three days and\nit shows. There's a feel that he's just slapped together music he's used to in an attempt that it might\nactually work, but it gives the\nalbum a feel of one long mono to nous drone.\nIf we had just heard the backing\nby itself, we would pray to carry\nthis album, and although his voice\nis clearly needed it seems to drag\nthe album down even more when\nthe listener just wants him to give\nthem some sort of a tune.\nIf you liked the Pixies, there's no guarantee that you will like this\nalbum, as it's too much the same\nthroughout. If you've heard any of\nthe songs from the album, then\nyou will probably like the entire\nalbum, but only in the same way\nwe all loved those 1 7 re-mixes of\nRobert Miles's Children. This album\nis Black in that its so bland it lacks\nanything uplifting like a melody, but\nis it Frank? Well only in Cockney\nrhyming slang, d David H.G ang Starr are back with their\nhotly awaited new album\nMoment of Truth. Good news for the hardcore fans is that\nnot much has really changed as\nGuru states on the intro to the fine\nfirst track, You Know my Steez, 'we\nhad the right idea at the begin-ning...the rhyme style is elevated,\nthe style of beats is elevated but\nit's still Guru and Premier...' And it\nmost certainly is, Moment of Truth\nis a return to Gang Starr's best.\nGuru's deep monotone vocals lace\nand loop between some of DJ\nPremier's best tunes to date.\nThere is somewhat of a dichotomy in the album though.\nOn the one hand Gang Starr in\ntracks like, Robbin Hood Theory,\nNew York Strait Talk and Above the\nClouds, which features Inspectah\nDeck of the Wu Tang Clan, maintain their usual slightly more hardcore East Coast sound but the general feel of the whole album is\nmore of a mellow West Coast\ngroove. Summery piano tunes float\nover laid back, deep hip hop beats\nwith sweet female vocals looping\naround in the background on many\nof the tracks. All this leads to a brilliant album that not so much grabs\nyou and shakes you about but massages your mind and before you\nknow it you are caught up swaying\nside to side head bobbing to the\naddictive hook and beat.\nHowever the stand out tunes\nfor me. The Militia and the best\ntrack on the album The Rep Crows\nBigga, are the darker more hard\nsounding tracks. This is a truly\nexcellent album that anyone who\nknows their hip hop will buy. This\nGang get five Starrs. CI\nRamzi\n\n"

Security\ninvestigated, saw the device and\ndecided to empty the building until\nit had been made safe. The police\nwere called in, and all the nearby\nadministrative staff were evac u at ed. At the time, final year biology\nstudents were sitting exams in the\nGreat Hall. However, it was decided to leave them undisturbed as\nthey were deemed to be a safe distance from the suspected bomb.\nOn investigation, the Bomb Squad\ndiscovered the object to be a fake,\nconstructed of aluminium cans and\nfoil. \"It was a definite attempt to\nimitate a bomb\", said Ken Weir,\nChief Security Officer.\nAlthough the incident is under\ninvestigation and fingerprints are\nbeing studied, there is little chance\nof identifying the perpetrator. The\npossibility that the scare was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the\nexaminations has not been ruled\nout.\nKen Weir has requested that\nstudents do not leave their personal belongings outside the Great Hall\nduring the exam period. He also\nreminded students to take all their\nbelongings with them at the end of\nthe exam, especially swipe cards,\nwhich have been left behind several times this term.\nNews in Brief...\nCOMPUTER\nTHEFTS STOPPED\nTwo thieves were disturbed during an attempted robbery in the\nElectrical Engineering building last\nThursday night, preventing the\nloss of thousands of pounds' worth of computer equipment.\nThe men had broken in to an IT\nlab on the eight floor, and had\nbegun to remove computers from\nthe desks ready to carry them\nfrom the building when a security\nofficer who was locking up\nentered the area. The department\nwas quickly sealed off, but the\nthieves managed to exit the building and hid in Ayrton Road. A chase ensued, but the men escaped. It is thought that\nalthough the robbers knew where\nto find the equipment, they\nlacked detailed knowledge of the\nbuilding\nTOP-UP FEES\nDANGER\nStudents are once again facing\nthe prospect of top-up fees as\nMPs voted to overturn critical\namendments made by the House\nof Lords in the Teaching and\nHigher Education Bill. Amongst\nother changes, the peers voted to\ncontinue means tested main-tenants grants for students and\nspecifically prohibit universities\nfrom charging their own top-up\nfees. The clause has now been\nmodified so that an institution\nmay charge extra fees if they can\nprovide satisfactory justification.\nThe bill, which has now reached report stage and will\nreturn to the House of Lords next\nmonth, can be read at www.par-lia ment. the stationery office. co.u k/pa/ cm199798/ cm bills/18 l/1998181. htm.\nResearchers \"to Cure Cancer in Two Yearsrr\nED SEXTON\nThe last few weeks have seen a deluge of publicity concerning\npossible cures for cancer.\nThis week international headlines reported the success of an\nAmerican group in eradicating\ntumours in mice. The research\nteam, who are based in Boston,\nhave produced a drug cocktail\nwhich reduces the blood supply to\ndeveloping tumours.\nThe cocktail consists of two\ndrugs, endo statin and ang io statin, that seem to work synergistic ally in\npreventing blood vessels from supplying cancerous growths. Not\nonly does this starve the tumour of\nessential nutrients, but it also prevents the spread of cancer cells, so\nthe tumour remains benign. Dr\nJudah Folkman, pioneer of the new\ntreatment, has been cautious about\nits effectiveness in humans, but this\nhasn't stopped a human trial being\norganised for the coming year. Nor has it stopped share prices in\nEntreMed Inc, the company with\nthe rights to the two drugs, from\nsoaring this month. Media attention has been further intensified by\nthe comments of Dr James Watson, the Nobel laureate who discovered\nthe structure of DNA: He told a reporter for the New York Times\n\"Judah is going to cure cancer in\ntwo years.\"\nThen it was the turn of the\nImperial Cancer Research Fund.\nResearchers in Dundee have isolated a single gene (again in mice)\nthat seems to be crucial in preventing damage from carcinogens. The\ngene is particularly important in the\nlungs and bladder, two tissues that\nare often sites of smoking-related\ncancers. Individuals with 'faulty'\ncopies of the gene are more likely\nto develop cancers than those with\nfunctional copies. The finding\ncould also allow the use of genetic\nengineering to prevent certain can-cer s. Although the British research\nhas not received the media attention of the Boston group, both are\nsignificant developments in the\nfight against cancer.\nMeanwhile the Cancer\nResearch Campaign is concentrating on another drug,\nCombretastatin A4, which is similar\nin effect to the endo statin ang io statin combination. Human trials\nare due to begin in November,\nbefore the American trial begins.\nWhile Dr Watson's comments\nmay be over-optimistic, we can\nexpect a variety of new therapies\nand treatments to become available early in the new millenium.\nThe holy grail of 'a cure for cancer'\nis still out of reach, but perhaps not\nout of sight. Our understanding of\ncancer is growing at an exponential\nrate and, although media hype may\nbe raising false hopes once again, it\nseems that a cure for cancer may\nbe a viable possibility within the\nnext decade. With a third of all\nWesterners suffering from cancer\nat some point in their lives, that has\nto be good news.\nTHE\nFELIX\nWEEK\nArts Meeting - 1pm.

To this day I still\nhave a sneaking suspicion that Paul\ngot the better of the deal. That for\nme was the moment I disengaged\nthe angry young man and inserted\nugly, unloved and hapless in its\nplace. And that place had no place\nfor Nick Cave.\nFunny then that the Bad Seeds\nshould now fit so seamless ly into\nmy life, not that I have resorted to\npast punk ideals, on the contrary, it\nis because, although Nick Cave\nmay still have a fixation with death\n(exorcised in some part by the\nmighty Murder Ballads) he has\nchannelled his energies into creating some of the most beautifully\nloathsome low life with which to\nrecount his stories. And whilst he\ntakes the role of recalcitrant\npreacher here or incestuous bump kin there, the rest of the Bad Seeds\npump out big bastard gospel melodies that God himself would\nhave wished to have had written\nfor him.\nNot that there isn'ta place for\nlove in the songs, it's just that\nthrough the eyes of one of Caves\ncharacters, love can be an infatuation with the macabre, the innocent\nor just the plain bizarre and sometimes it's difficult to tell one from\nthe other.\nAnd when people sneer and say\nthat he sold out with Kylie, (in clu d ed here on the album) take a step\nback and see it for what it is. Her\nbeauty to his beast. The perfect foil\nfor the master storyteller,\nInspirational. H Davros C. Dick\nIron Maiden\nVirtual XI \u2022\nExamining the track listing for\nthis album, I began to suspect\nthat a playing time of 53:22\ncoupled with the inclusion of a mere eight tracks meant a battery\nof six-and-a half minute epics with\nfar more space for solo-ing than\ncan really be considered healthy.\nHaving said that, the LP kicks off\nwith a mere three-minute piece of\nriff ola containing most of the elements that made Maiden famous\nall those years ago. My first imp res sion, though, is that fizzy overproduction robs the recording of the\nrocking edge that people with black\nclothes, chains and long hair found\nso exquisite on Running Free.\nPerhaps the members of the band\nhave sat on one comfy sofa too\nmany in their old age, or maybe\nthey just made the mistake of\nrecording at a studio in Essex.\nWe plod through The Angel and\nthe Cambler, another track seemingly performed in a shoe box,\nbefore the tre m dives and minor\npentatonic scales rear their ugly\nheads. Lightning Strikes Twice\ngrabs a few points back, with a piece of guitar masturbation incorporating some inexcusable harmonic runs, which should please\nany diehard metal technician\nrequiring yet another Maiden record.\nSo the standard is set for the\nremainder of the songs, with all the\nabove continuing in equal measure.\nIf you already own all six thousand\nprevious IM albums, you will find\neverything that was present on Iron\nMaiden in similar fashion here,\nie magic in gre sd to create a sequel?

Highlighting the pivotal\nmoments in the labels lifetime\ngives a good indication of their\noverall sound.\nJo Public\nshow on what radio station.\na. Radio 1\nb. Kiss FM\nc.

Calling all budding\ndesigners: here's your\nchance to show off your design\nskills by creating a new logo for\nPhuture Trax. I'm sure most of you don't even know who or what\nPhuture Trax are. Well, let me\nexplain, they are probably the\nbiggest and some would say the\nbest PR company and record label\nall under one roof, supplying people like me with records, CDs etc to\nreview and play out. Did I mention\nthis is on a worldwide scale, so the\nwinner will have their logo on all\ntheir merchandise all over the\nworld. But you also win a huge\npackage of all the CDs, records and\n16B. Sounds From Another Room\n(Eye Q) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis, again, is an album that defies\ncategorisation coming from the\nhighly impressive 16B. This album\ntwists and turns, with nearly every\ntrack changing style and sound.\nFrom funky down-beat tracks to\nsoulful deep house and everything\nin between, this album has ali your\nheart could desire. From 16By ou'd expect nothing but the finest,\nsmoothest production techniques,\nwhich, as ever, you get. Melody Maker called this an early contender\nfor album of the year, but, although\nthis is a good album, I feel you have\nto be into the more downbeat side\nof things to really appreciate it. A very pleasant and refreshing collection of beats that should do very\nwell.\nDub Funk Association.\nConfrontation in Dub. -kkk k This is an album of remixes of tracks\ntaken from the last three albums\nreleased by Dub Funk Association,\nbringing together Reggae, Jazz,\nTechno and House, combined with\nplenty of funk. For this album, they\nhave asked various producers to\nremix any track from the three previous albums in any style.\nWhat you end up with is 16 tracks\nranging from the blunted Hip-Hop\njoints of Part 2, Jah Rasta Dub workings from Shotgun Rockers, and a trance y house number from Spiral\nHead, alongside smooth Drum and\nBass tracks by Fellowship and\nEmdee (Splash Juice records),\n8 May 1998\ntapes they can lay their hands on,\nso you' d better bring a truck.\nIdeally they would like the logo\nshown below elaborated on, modernised and expanded on.\nFor more info call Jodie at\nPhuture Trax on 0171 357 004.

You may think all these\ndifferent styles wouldn't sit comfortably together but you' d be mis-taken. In some strange way, they all\nfit together nicely, with the electronic (computer synthesised) feel\nbeing the common denominator.\nThis is one of the more adventurous\nalbums around at the moment.\nGlobal Underground - John Digweed in Sydney\nA double CD from John Digweed, a DJ who from humble beginnings,\nhas made his name as one of the\nleading House DJs on the world\nstage, mainly by avoiding all the\nhype and bullshit and by letting his\ntune selection and mixing ability do\nthe talking. Unlike most House CDs\nyou've seen this year, you won't be\nable to find any chart toppers here.\nThis is the second House CDI 've\nheard this year that is a cheese free\nzone with only the choicest cuts of\ndeep, trance y and experimental\nhouse being used.\nAs you' d expect, the mixing is as\nseamless and progressive as always\nwith Digweed keeping it real. Many of the tracks will be unfamiliar even\nto the trains potters out there, as\nthere are plenty of unreleased\ntracks and dub plate pressure on\nthese CDs.

    "content": "8 May 1998 COLUMNS\nTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nOh God, Jimmy, no.\nIt's not too often that I find myself handing\nthis column in to Jeremy late, but 1 am afraid\nthat this is one of those weeks. This is due to\nthe rather unfortunate bombshell that I have an\nexam tomorrow, and still haven't starting revising yet. Why not? - well, some might quote me\nan answer containing the words \"bone-idle\",\n\"lay about\" and \"good-for-nothing\". True as these\nscandalous accusations might ultimately be, I am going to suggest a far more noble cause: the\nEmbassy World Championship Snooker.\nYes: it's that time of year again when men in\nwaistcoats and bow ties knock a kaleidoscope\nof colour around an apparently chlorophyll-sat-u rated piece of cloth. Eventually one of them\nwins an obscene quantity of hard cash through\nthis apparently very simple activity, but by gum, the spectators don't half have some fun along\nthe way...\nAfter seeing Jimmy White lose a dozen or so\nheartbreaking frames on the trot one year to\nStephen Hendry, I decided that the subsequent\noperation 1 had to have performed on my nervous system was something I was unlikely to be\nable to afford again, and vowed to give up my\nimportant role as a spectator of this Sport of\nKings. Snooker is snooker, though, and so when I heard that instantly recognisable BBC Sport\nmusical interlude, I knew that the next two\nweeks were going to be completely out of com mission for any purpose other than eating\ncrisps, drinking coffee, and smoking a lot of cig-are tte s. So the dice were cast, and just as the\nprevalence of Wimbledon fills houses with\ngrunts and the erratic bleeps of Cyclops, so the\nalluring Siren that is the sound of two snooker\nballs colliding draws me down from my economics revision. 1 do not even have the luxury of\nlashing myself to the mast.\nSo follows days of cheers, groans, and muttered conversations about the \"foul and a miss\"\nrule. The first rounds of any major tournament,\nbe it snooker, tennis or tiddlywinks, seldom\ncontain any major drama as the top seeds blast\ntheir way through the board, greatly upsetting\nthe young qualifying hopefuls. This year, how ev er, was a very welcome exception, as the\nunseeded Jimmy \"bookie's friend\" White battered Stephen Hendry who was then the world\nNumber One. Even after this beautifully controlled display, there was little doubt in any-body's mind that poor Jimmy, a runner-up in the\nfinal six times, didn't stand an earthly; it was\nperhaps fitting that it was the job of Ronnie\nO 'Sullivan, often considered White's contemporary replacement, to send him packing yet\nagain.\nThis demonstrates admirably another\nappealing facet of the game: it is a game of\ncharacters. From the unbridled arrogance of\nStephen Hendry to the cheeky chirp y Scouse\ntwang of John \"don't let me into your dressing\nroom or I 'll steal your trousers\" Parrott, or the\ncalculated conservative play of 80s wizard Steve\nDavis, everybody has their eccentricities, and\nthe concentration that the sport requires seems\nto merely amplify these twitches. There are also\nthe wags behind the microphones: John Virgo,\nDennis Taylor, and that fellow who has recently\nretired; you know, the biased one who whispered a lot: \"1 think Jimmy's left a red on. Wait,\nhe's left two.... Or is it three.... Oh God, Jimmy,\nno. Please, God, no. NO OOO OO\" So there you have it. I know nothing about\nindifference maps, how to maximise a firm's profits or Game Theory. But Ido know a lot\nabout referee indifference, the maximum break\nprize and the theory behind the greatest table\nsport in the world.\nAli Campbell\nGoulash\nThis week we head east, pass over a few intervening countries and arrive in Hungary to sample the local mainstay, goulash. This was originally a low-budget stew eaten in the country but\nhas now been upgraded to a posher international status. Somehow the transition managed to\nchange the name as well: despite the spelling,\ngoulash is 'gouy ash' as a rather excited hungarian restaurateur once told me (over and over and\nover again throughout an expansive dinner).\nThe originality of goulash is that it is spiced\nwith paprika, a mild/very mild chilli grown in\nHungary. The same restaurateur also told me\nthat he used a heaped tablespoon of paprika per\nperson and the result was excellent but you\nmight want to start with less especially if you're\na chilli-wuss.\nAnother hot tip I 've recently discovered is\nthat those of you who have problems with beef\ncan use some neck of lamb and get something\njust as delicious. So there.\nAnd finally 1 thoroughly recommend this dish\nif you're camping and have to cook for lots of\npeople on only one heat source since the s tod ge cooks in the splodge if you know what I mean.\nO This, as all good vampires will know, is the\nneck of a lamb.\nYou will need:\nVI Vi - 2 lb beef / lamb\n2 onions\n\u00ae\" 2 oz butter\nT1t bl flour (heaped)\n\u00bb\" 1 tin tomatoes\n'A pt red wine\n\u00ab' 1 pt stock (possible cheat with cubes)\n5T bouquet garni or just any old herbs\n\u00ab\" paprika, lots\n* small tub of soured cream\n\u00ab\" 6-8 spuds\nStart of by cutting the meat into 'A inch\ncubes (or get your local butchered family to do it for you). Heat up a large frying pan, melt the\nbutter in it and gently fry both the sliced onions\nand the meat until well brown. Grind some pepper into the pan, add the flour and leave to\nsinge for a good minute stirring all the time. Put\neverything into a large saucepan and de glaze the frying pan with the wine. Leave the wine to\nsimmer gently for a moment, scraping the base\nof the pan to dissolve all those pyro geni c chemicals and then add it to the meat and onions.\nAlso add the tomatoes, stock, bouquet, salt and\na couple more pints of water to the saucepan.\nHeat this up and leave to simmer for at least\nI Vi hours.\nMeanwhile wash and dice the potatoes into\n1\" cubes. You then add these and the paprika to\nthe stew '/z hour before you want to eat, bring\nback up to the boil and simmer.\nThe finishing touch is to add the cream to\nthe goulash just before serving with some good crusty bread and the rest of the wine if it's still\naround.\nAntoine\n\n"

    "content": "INCOMING 8 May 1998\nLetters to Felix... Trouble Ahead for\nCampus Renaissance\nLEAN, MEAN AND TURNING GREEN\nDear Editor,\n1 thought I might offer further\ninsight into the rector's comment: \"My students are no smarter than\nthose at Oxford or Cambridge,\nthey're meaner and leaner\"\nSir Ronald Oxbrough.\nMeaner because they have to\ndeal with nightmarish ac com mod ation officers [Letters, Felix 1 106 &.\n1109] and landlords [House of Hell\n- Felix 1113].\nLeaner because they eat food served up by IC catering.\nOn a second note, perhaps we should all get a glimpse of the\nSherfield extravagance mentioned\nby Simon. It would be a great fun\nfor Sherfield's suite 5 to be opened up for visitors (a bit like the Lord\nchancellor's apartments) we could\nthen all stand in awe of the decor\nand excellent equipment (so I 've\nheard); mega-pentium s( used to\nrun the exceedingly processor- and\nmemory- intensive programs such\nas MS Excel, Word etc.), portable\nlaptops, Psion organisers etc. and\nthen return to our cold, pokey,\ndim-lit, asbestos-ceiling (in Huxley\nanyway) offices to do more research, that gets awarded grants\nthat makes Sherfield go round.\nRegards,\nMad hu Bhabuta, PG\nHOUSE OF HELL\nPART II\nDear Felix\nI have been meaning to write\nthis letter for some time and letter\n'House of hell1 in this weeks issue\n(1113) at last prompted me to do so. The reason is that I too have\nsuffered at the hands of the landlady mentioned in that letter as, Iam sure, have many other I.C students\nand Iam glad that this issue has\nbeen brought to peoples attention.\nThis, however, is not the main\nreason for me writing. I feel, as\nclearly does my colle gue from flat\n2, 42 Queen's gate gardens, that\nserious questions have to be asked\nof the ac coma dati on office and the\nservice (or lack of it) that they provide for I.C students.\nAfter having lived for a year in\nsub-standard, over priced ac coma dati on at the adress mentioned\nabove (as advertised by the I. Cac coma dati on office) my current\nflat mates and 1 returned to the\nac coma dati on office in search of\nsomething better. We had been\nlooking for weeks for something\nsuitable but had found nothing and\nthe end of term was now upon us.\nIn desperation we went to the\nac coma dati on office for some help\nand advice and what did we get?....\nA copy of 'Loot'.\nThis second example of total\nindifference to the student led me\nto wonder what the people in the\nac coma dati on office actually do all\nday (apart from not be able to work\nout that a flat containing two double rooms and one single room is\nnot a flat for three people).\nAccomadation offices at many\nother universities offer all sorts of\nhelp and services to their customers (yes we are customers\nsince, without us they would not\nhave a job) including landlord vet-ting, ac coma dati on inspections\nand contract checking. Iam not\nsuggesting that they check the flat\nor house of every student before\nthey move in but the least you\nmight expect is that the properties\nand landlords that they advertise\nbe looked at. Under their system it\nseems that any old tax dodger with\nsome flats that he can't let out to\nthe general public because they are\nin such bad condition can simply\nphone them up and ask them to\nadd it too their lists (apologies to\nany legitimate landlords reading\nthis).\nIt is well known that finding\ngood ac coma dati on in London is a nightmare so we must demand better help and advice. The service\nthat I have experienced from this\ncollege department is appa ling and\nclearly a waste of our money. The\nanswer is simple: either get the\npeople in charge to buck their\nideas up or close the place down\nonce the halls have been filled each\nyear and put the money into something useful (education perhaps?)\nAs for all of the other Sherfield\ndepartments, well there's not room\nto moan about you here. Some\nother time maybe?\nCheers\nRich Setchfield, Aero III\nNightmare landlord or house? Let\nus know, the name / address and\nwhat problems they have caused\nyou, and we will produce a 'name\nand shame' list of our own. Ed\nSOUND ADVICE\nDear Felix\nThanks for reporting the mayoral elections last issue [news,\n1113]. While I think that a mayor\nfor London is a good idea, 1 would\nlike to tell readers on thing - when we do get to vote on who it will be,\nDON'T vote for Jeffery Archer.\nThis man is a con-artist and a liar. Through out his career he has\ncont s tant ly claimed to have a degree from Oxford university\n(which he hasn't),a diploma in\nanatomy from a prestigious\nAmerican college (which he hasn't) and that he holds qualifications\nfrom the International Federation\nof Physical Culture (which doesn't exist).\nWhen voted on to the Greater\nLondon Council in 1967, he\nclaimed to be the youngest councillor ever (which he wasn't), and\nimmediately started a scheme to\nfiddle colle gue' s expenses. While\non the GLC, he also joined and\nextorted expenses from the United\nNations Association. He then\nattempted to sue newspapers carrying this story in order to improve\nhis image enough to get elected as\na tory MP, giving up the suit a few\nyears later. Once again, he claimed\nto be the youngest member of parliament (which he wasn't, by five\nyears).\nArcher's dod gy share dealings\nwith both Aquablast and Anglia TV\nare well known. Less common knowledge is a blatant shoplifting\noffence - he stole three suits values\nat $ 5 4 0 from an American department store.\nThis man cannot be trusted\nwith a baby's rattle, let alone the\ncapital city of England. DON'T VOTE FOR HIM. Alex Mc Murphy, Me ch Eng\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday.

    "content": "8 May 1998 FICTION 27\npeople in her group of climbers were in a bad state. However, they would all only gat one day's rest before the guides would\npress ahead for the summit. They would go without sleep for forty hours and she mumbled some-thing about being worried about the amount of oxygen they were allowed to carry. I knew that a helicopter rescue at that altitude was unthinkable.\nIt was at that point that worry began to turn into genuine dread. During a rare moment of mental clarity I sat down and attempted to imagine a world without Susan. That was finally when I realised how much I had under est i mated my feelings. Prom that stage onward, she was there in my waking mind constantly. On the designated day of her assault on the summit my already severely affected ability to concentrate broke down\ncompletely. Ky attempts at doing any work were a farce, and making some excuse, I left the office early. I was\npainfully aware that no one seemed as worried about Susan as I was. That night I didn't even pretend that I thought I might get some sleep. Susan reached the top of Mount Everest with seven other climbers, two guides and five sherpa s. The climb had\ngone smoothly and according to plan. It was on the descent that the problems began. Prom what I had heard, at least two of the climbers were reaching utter exhaustion at this stage and began to severely hamper the climb. The guides\nresorted to the emergency measure of injecting the small ampoule of cortisone that every climber carried around\ntheir neck. Extra oxygen was also administered but it appeared that they had taken action too late. A storm was\napproaching and all they had time to do was to try and find some shelter; fatally inadequate shelter as it turned\nout. For twenty hours they had cowered in temperatures of minus sixty degrees centigrade, waiting for some improvement in the conditions. Somehow, a radio link to base camp was established and all members of the party were\nallowed one satellite phone call. All except three that is, who were suffering from such extreme exhaustion and\nhypothermia that they were unable to even speak. I later discovered that one of them had lost a glove at this stage\nand that that hand was effectively already lost. Susan tried to phone her parents but after she had failed to get\nthrough had called me. Above the shrieking wind she had shouted in a cracked voice, telling me she would make It, again and again. She was trying to convince herself. ian lng rul and comforting but I Tailed her. What I said was banal, hol mattered though, she was almost delirious. I truly believed she was\nI tried desperately to say some thir low, and above all, false. I don't thin It was two days before I heard the\nhospital: my fe\nworse than anything that I> ugh t was beyond me. I left behind forever. i had made it back to\ner to her in the\ni rica l,Ih ree times e way to\nmm\noffice I had decided to destroy the letter, but something else In me always won over. Worst of all, In the last sen-ten ce, which had taken an hour to commit to paper, I had asked her to marry me.\nSitting In this cafe, thinking the whole thing over rationally, I conclusively came to the decision that the\nletter had been a mistake. Il it another cigarette, registering blankly that it was the last In the packet. Oh yes, a mistake of whopping proportions. I had been a bungling, hysterical, Idiot, behaving like some pubescent school kid. I had to make a physical effort to prevent myself from cringing. At best she would laugh at me, at worse... well, I was-n't even going to contemplate. Would our relationship ever be the same again? Pigs might fly, I thought, looking up\nwith a mirthless grin. Pigs might Tucking fly. Forty minutes before her plane was due to touch down I was at the arrivals gate, behaving like a man with fever. I cannot describe the thoughts I was thinking. An eternity later, groups of bleary eyed people began to spill Into the cavernous airport hall. Briefly I fought\nthe urge to quite simply run away, and moved forward to try and spot Susan. When I saw her, I was surprised that I felt no shock at the condition she was In. Her face looked like she had been awake non-stop for a month. She was pale despite a deep tan and walking painfully slowly. I felt Ilka I was In autopilot as I began to walk through the crowd\ntowards her. I had almost reached her before she looked up.\nThere was a pause whilst her tired eyes looked right through me. Then, with a barely audible sob, she stepped\nInto my arms and bur led her face in my shoulder. Suddenly I felt that we were alone In the universe. We stood for along time, without words, It seemed we shared a million unspoken thoughts. Finally she stirred and\nwhispered three words Into my ear.\nIt took along time for those words to find the designated area of my mind. I stopped running my hand\nthrough the hair at the back of her head. They were words uttered so many times, unthinkingly, uncaring ly, thrown away, always without consequence, until now. Along time later I gathered myself and croaked in an unsteady voice,\" I...I' m sorry about the letter...I really don't know what- I...\" my speech faltered. What letter? She breathed In my ear.\nFor the first time I let her go and looked Into her ey a s,ey as that were so dark\nthat it was almost impossible to tell were her irises ended and her pupils began. Then,\nsoftly, I began to cry. Any comments on this story? Email caspar.w rede@ lc.ac.uk.\n\n"

    "content": "20\nREVIEWS AND COMPETITIONS FILM 8 May 1998\nSCREAM 2\nStarring: Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox,\nDirector: Wes Craven\nDavid Arquette\nT his is how sequels should be\nmade - the same winning formula that made the first film\nsuch a success, a damn fine plot,\nwhich develops the character outlines presented in the first film, plus\nan amazing degree of self re ferenc ing. In fact, so strongly are some of\nthe jokes, and indeed the plot\nitself, reliant on Scream, that I would suggest anyone who hasn't yet seen the first film do so before\nwatching Scream 2.\nNeve Campbell returns to star\nonce again, and although she's now moved to College her past\ncontinues to follow her. On the\nopening night of Stab, a film about\nthe murders in Scream written by\nCourteney Cox's amoral reporter\nGale Weathers, the masked murderer strikes. And so the cycle\nbegins again...\nObviously, the best thing about\nScream was the way the film managed to send-up the entire horror\ngenre, whilst still being a horror\nflick. In this, Scream 2 is even more\nsuccessful. Early on in the film,\ngeeky film student Randy (one of\nfour characters to survive from the\noriginal) lists the central tenets of a horror sequel. It must be more gory\nthan the first film; the death\nsc en ces must be more elaborate;\nthe body-count must be higher.\nBrilliantly, writer Kevin Williamson\nthen includes all these elements\nover the course of the next ninety\nminutes, whilst still managing to\nsend up the entire concept of the\nsequel. This culminates in a final\nscene which utterly breaks the final\nrule - never ever kill off the bad-guy\nfor sure (otherwise, how can you make part three). And, I promise,\nyou'll never guess who did it.\nThe one down side is Wes Craven's directing. Although brilliantly controlling the tension in the\n\"horror\" scenes, he simply isn't any\ngood at \" normal\" filmmaking. Blasting over-the-top soundtrack\nmusic (which he's lifted from\nBroken Arrow, where it was cheesy\nenough to start with) simply isn't necessary.\nFortunately, however, any\nerrors on Wes Craven's part are\nmore than adequately made up for\nvia Kevin Williamson' s script.\nTurning an ironic eye over the\ngenre, the film, the plot and even\nthe principal actors previous\ncareers (the Friends references are\ngreat), without for one moment\nslipping into farce, he still managing to keep you on the edge of your\nseat for the full two hours. You simply won't believe that this is the\nman also responsible for the the\ntravesty that was / Know What You\nDid Last Summer. 1*1\nDave\nWin tickets galore courtesy of\nKENSINGTON\nMonica meet Frank, Daniel and\nLaurence is described as \"this years\nFour Weddings &. A Funeral\". You\nknow how it is - American girl flies\ninto London, the guy on the plane\nnext to her falls in love with her.\nThen the guy in the airport, then\nthe guy in the park....Only they're\nbest friends. Will it work? Is it\nfunny? You have your chance to\ndecide, even before the review hits\nthese pages, with free tickets courtesy of those lovely people at the\nOdeon Kensington. For your\nchance win, tell us;\nMartha meet... stars Monica\nPotter whose last big screen outing was as Nicholas Cage's wife\nin which of last summer's block-busters?\nTo enter simply email your\nanswer to film.felix@ic.ac.uk,\nbefore Monday evening.\nThe answers to last week's poser was: Kevin Williamson wrote\nlast years / know what you did last\nsummer, the sequel to which will\nbe appearing later this year. He definitely didn't write Halloween.\nSo there.\nThe first five names out of the\nFelix hat were:\nT McCartney\nStephane Bouvet\nA Simpson\nFolarin Majekodunmi\nBeng K Ooi\nPlease drop into the office to\npick up your prizes.\nBREAKOUT\nStarring: William McNamara, Maria Pitillo, Tom Conti\nDirector: John Hough\nIf you want to see a really good film, then I'd definitely recommend that you avoid\n\"Something to Believe in\" like the\nplague. Believe in life, believe in\nlove, believe in yourself, believe in\nmiracles (so the film's blurb tells\nus), believe that this is really bad.\nIf you're still interested after\nthat intro. the plot is as follows.\nMaggie (Pitillo), a blackjack dealer\nin Las Vegas, discovers she has a fatal affliction and has a few weeks\nto live. So, she decides to set off\nto Italy to be healed by a statue of\nthe Madonna. On the way she\nmeets Mike( McNamara), a struggling pianist going to a com pet i tion, and they fall in love. But is\ntheir love doomed because she is\ndying? Can the statue save her, or\nis it just a fake? - you'll just have to\nwait to see the sickeningly predictable conclusion of the film.\nAt one point I thought the film\nmight be trying to take the piss out\nof itself, but it was just too shit.\nThe acting was bad; the plot bor-ing; the script lifeless. There's a nice bit of piano playing though.D Adam\n\n"

London the largest city in\nthe UK also has the least property available for students. The landlords know this, and charge almost\nas much rent as 'professional'\nhomes poor quality properties.\nWhile a student studying in, say,\nSheffield might typically pay \u00a3 3 0\u00a3 4 0 for a room in a terrace house\nwith a lounge and garden, their\nLondon contemporaries are lucky\nto get away with less than \u00a3 7 0 for\na small room in a crumbling flat\nwith no communal space.\nFurther more, you can walk\naround Sheffield in any of the suburbs near the university, and you will see countless signs advertising\nvacant student accommodation, and even specialist estate agents.\nThe properties are generally well\nlooked-after and compare favourably to the 'ordinary' homes\nnext door. In contrast, student\nhouses in London bear no resemblance to resident's flats and rarely\nhave all the basic essentials for\nhabitation - a lounge, a proper\nbathroom and kitchen, hot water,\nelectricity and some sort of garden\nor rights to an open space.\nLast year, I lived in a fairly typical student flat in Earl's Court. We had no living room, a tiny kitchen\nand several bedrooms had been\nsplit up to bring the total to seven.\nMy own room measured 5 foot by\n1 1 foot, and had no windows. And the cost? \u00a3 6 8 per week, now \u00a3 7 3\nand rising at \u00a35 each year. I have\nheard of and seen much worse\nthan this.\nGiven all these problems, why\nis it that we also have one of the\nworse student accommodation services in the country? The only\nservices provided by the SAO to\nstudents seeking private accommodation are unhelpful advice, a copy of Loot and the notorious\nproperty lists featuring landlords at\nvarious stages of hardened crime\nand properties which may or may\nnot have four walls and a roof.\nAfter that, you are on your own. So\nwhat should they be doing? The\nfirst and easiest step is to listen to\nwhat students are telling them about properties and landlords. 1\nam aware that the SAO has a policy of not vetting homes / landlord\n(which I strongly disagree with),\nbut the very least they can do is\nban from the lists those names\nwith the worst reputation, such as\nMrs Sofiar.\nSecondly, they can and should\ncheck properties and contracts\nbefore students sign and move in.\nThe SAO has a massive potential\ninfluence over landlords' behaviour. While landlords don't care a jot about individual tenants, if they\nknow that they will not get any IC\nstudents until they act legally, they\nwill soon come up to scratch\nLastly, the College should consider the shining example set by\nHull University (yes, really). They\nhave a policy of signing longer term\ntenancies on suitable properties\nand then sub-letting them to stu-dents. This allows them to keep the\nprices down, the landlords in\ncheck, and the students well\nlooked-after. Do you think the SAO would ever do that? Would a landlord ever let you off the rent?\nSmall Ads\nTh\nthi\nshed Fellowship is only awarded to\nved the Union in a selfless and\npti on a] and beyond reproach.

    "content": "MUSIC 8 May 1998\nICLES\n12\nm There's a comfortably large\nbody of singles for you to\ndigest this week. So sit back,\nrelax, read and enjoy...\nAfter the success of Brimful\nOfAsha the world's ears are\nwaiting for an equally uplifting follow-up. Of course, this is a Cornershop song rather than a Norman Cook remix so it is rather\ndifferent but the enticing melody\nand thought-provoking lyrics that\nmake up Sleep On The Left Side\nnever fail to draw you in.\nStuck Mojo produce a predictable mix of heavy metal thrash\nand Chilli Pepper pseudo-rap. At\nleast Rising has great lyrics. \"Liar\nliar, pants on fire\" is the only bit I could understand.\nThe Only One starts with some nice guitar strumming, then has\nsome traditional Irish music, then\ngoes all Natalie Imbruglia sub-indie\nangst. That's about it from\njunk ster, really. Ed\nS mash Mouth's The Fonz has\na big dirty opening but\ndescends into a fairly average\nsong that just plods along without\nreally taking you anywhere. There's only really the musical stop before\nthe chorus that's going to keep you\nlistening. Mind you, you could always listen to the live version of\nWalkin' on the Sun. Track 3, if you were wondering.\nBoom Boom Mancini release\nArguments and Alcohol, which is a fantastic title, isn't it? I think everyone can claim his or her's fair share.\nSexy female vocals, happy bassline\nand a chorus that most people will\nfind themselves either singing along\nto or reproducing on the phone\ncome Saturday morning: \"I didn't really mean it. I'd like to try again.\"\nContinuing the fantastic titles\ntheme, Snow Patrol's100 Things\nyou Should Have Done In Bed is\nobviously a take on all these maga-zines, such as FHM and Maxim, that have articles like 50 Ways to\ndo it When You're 50! Jumpy in a lo-fi garage sort-of way. Worth listening to for a while.\n\"Iam a square peg in a star-shaped hole\" Maybe Clitterbox are\ntrying to say they're not cut out for\nfame with latest release, Houdini.\nI'd propose that they're wrong. A refreshing and cooling mint to take\naway the stench of meat and potato guitar rock. Gorgeous and\nan the mic. Now they've been heard,\nlet's hope they don't do a disappearing act.\nSunhouse's Animal appears to\nbe a surprise. The peaceful acoustic\nmumbling s of the verses come to\nserve as no sort of portent for the\nfrighteningly fuzzy chorus. \"Aaargh!\n1 still feel like an animal!\" Wo ah! Calm down, mate. Their last single\nbeing a brood y blues track, it seems\nthat they've tapped into something\na bit more primal and this is to their\ncredit.\nThere's a driving bassline here\nthat chugs relentlessly and gives Six\nby Seven's Candlelight a kind of\nperpetual motion. Propelling forward with no apparent ending,\nyou're sucked into its paranoia. You\nBallroom\nDon't Stop\nBeautifully majestic. Imagine\nEmbrace's All You Good Good People without the arrogance,\nwithout the sneers, without the\nhype chopping away at its heels.\nAwash with strings by the end,\nDon't Stop is an awakening that\ntakes you onto its magic carpet\nand flies you away from all the\ncrap. Effortlessly uplifting.\nDennis\nappear to be greeted with a light at\nthe end of the tunnel, only to\nrealise it's another bloody train!\nThoroughly engaging.\nChrist, talk about formulaic!\nVerse, Chorus, Middle Eight,\nChorus, Solo. Despite the apparent\nconformity, Alison's Room still\ntransmits a raw intensity and you\ncan't help but get excited about the\npounding rhythm and catch in ess of\nthe song. As 60 Ft. Dolls' singer-guitarist Richard Parfitt declared: \"If\nOasis are the Beatles doing Abbey\nRoad, we're the Beatles in\nHamburg!\" Dennis\nBaby bird's Bad Old Man is a deliciously melancholic pop tune. Dark lyrics combine\nwith a slow, twisting piano melody\nto produce a brilliant single.\nKomputer's Valentina, on the\nother hand, is basically Kraftwerk\ngone horribly wrong. Awful lyrics,\nawful tune, awful single! Nuff said.\nSlow gospel funk melody and dreary lyrics supply a far below average\nsingle from Monkey Mafia. Long\nAs I Can See The Light is not what\nhas come to be expected of Jon\nCarter. Unfinished Monkey bus i ness, me thinks.\nCaught between indie and pop, The Jellys are still unsigned and no\nwonder! The more heavily guitar\ndriven tracks on the Head\nfirst... Legs last...EP are quite\ncatchy, though.\nThe First Things First EP provides drug addled lyrics of young love, prisons and the hard life.\nBeautifully sung by Lee Griffiths,\nthe male equivalent of Tracy\nChapman, with exquisitely understated acoustic instrumentation.\nSpearmint appear to be a mix\nbetween Dodgy and Gene. The Bsides on A Trip Into Space EP are\nmore measured acoustic affairs but\nthe title track is certainly a pop/dance/indie monster that\ncould be a summer hit.\nNew Rising's Drowning Reason\nis a reasonable listen. Distant male\nvocals filter through the haze of\nindie guitars and various effects. A good sounding track reminiscent of\nthe more mediocre Stone Roses\ntracks. Ramzi\nB lack Box Recorder's Child\nPsychology sees Auters\nscary-man Luke Haines back\nwith a tense and bitter-sweet track\nfeaturing the life story of a pro b lem-child. Exquisitely performed, it\nis slow, melodic and tragic but\nsadly rather vacuous. Like Fitter\nHappier, it doesn't stand up to\nrepeated listening.\nIdlewild A Film for the Future.\nIdlewild are inevitably going to be\ncompared to their Edinburgh contemporaries Urusei Yatsura, so 1\nmay as well be first. Their high-energy fuzzy guitars and supercharged punk y lyrics are indeed\nES S*HOON similar, but Idlewild are faster,\ndarker and heavier. A Film for the\nFuture is an arse-kicking romp of a track that demands the volume to\nbe cranked right up high. Their first\nsingle with the Food label, this is a cracking effort - Idlewild are going\nto be GOOD. Marcy Playground Sex and\nCandy. You must have heard this on\nthe radio - the one that goes\n\"Hanging round, downtown by\nmyself/ And there she was/ Like\ndouble cherry pie\". A fun, sing able ditty from their eponymous new\nalbum, this is an enjoyable but ultimately harmless number ideal for...\nwell, for day-time radio playlists.\nLower Crime Satillite\nFormulaic indie-rock, this rather\nsterilised, un dynamic song provides little interest. The B side, /\nAm Remote Control is better, a slower track performed with feeling\nthat shows initial promise, but sadly\ndescends into clich ed and unimaginative guitar solo.\nSpace Monkeys Sugar Cane is a Sugar-frosted not-quite rap not-quite-reggae mess. The Space\nMonkeys like to be cool and sing\nabout drugs, but they lack the\nhumour of Cypress Hill or the\npower of PWEI. B side Pin Up Boy\nis an attempt at a vocal-led ballad\nwhich, frankly, fails. Naff. Jeremy\niON accompany the acid-smooth\nvocals of Andy Yorke (yes, brother\nof the man himself) before bursting into a bold, clean but angst-ridden chorus. The song follows a simple template, but is no worse\noff for that. The single also\nincludes three more fine tracks not\non the album. When Unbelievable\nTruth reach the 'third album creative stage', they are going to be\nsomething special. But don't take\nmy word for it, listen for yourself at\nhttp://raft.v mg. co.uk/untruth/-new music/ Jeremy\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON "

I know that many people have\nexaminations at this time of year,\nbut you would think that at least a Andy Heeps: Nothing to Report\nfew people might do something\nvaguely news-worthy. We haven't even had reports of missing traffic\ncones, which frankly are ten a penny.\"\nPanic subsequently gripped the\noffice as all emergency investigations drew a blank. Extraordinary\nconsultations with Union officials\nproduced little more information\nthan, \"Bugger off, I'm working\". At\nthe eleventh hour, it was a certain\ndashing young journalist who saved\nthe day again by writing two hundred words of nonsense.\nThis occurrence adds weight to\nthe allegations that Imperial\nCollege, having recently risen\nabove Oxford to second place in\nthe Financial Times' university rank-in gs, now houses the second most\nboring campus inhabitants in the\ncountry.\nNUS Conference dec ends in to\nTribalism\nNEWSTEAM\nThe annual conference of the\nNational Union of Students last\nmonth crumbled into an angry\nslang ing match between the divided student parties. Speeches by\nboth the columnist Peter Hitchins\nand NUS president Doug Trainer\nincited demonstration and abuse\nso vocal that police and security\nwere called on to restore order and\neventually break up the conference.\nThe main source of friction was the\nincreasing challenge to Labour\nStudent's domination of the NUS from the Campaign for Free\nEducation.

In contrast, the\nCFE announced the launch of their\nnew anti-fees campaign \"Can't Pay,\nWon't Pay\", in which they hope to\nobtain 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 pledges from\nfuture students to default on their\npayments.\nThe conference ended with almost\nthe entire 2000-strong delegation\non their feet and shouting during\nDouglas Trainer's retirement\nspeech, which came to a climax\nwhen he accused the Socialist\nWorker Party of being \"paper-sell-ing loonies.\"\nThe\nStudents'\nNewspaper\nat Imperial\nCollege\nIssue11148 May1998 "

But this\ntime I was rolling VIP style and not\nonly was it the start of the 4 Liberty\nEuropean tour (Dreem Teem Mikee B, Sponny 8. Timmi Magic and Colour Girl and Luigi performing live) but the Freestylers (inter-view issue 1 106) were also in the\nhouse launching the all new breakbeat room. Nice touch.\nRight - some facts about\nFreedom - it's on every Saturday\nand has to be the biggest weekly\nevent in London. Some2,500 party people can fit in - the closest\nthing you'll get to a large-scale rave\nin town. Boasting four rooms of\nmusic, one playing Hardish House and the other has DJ Aerial playing\nhis mind-bending 10-hour set each\nweek - he plays what he plays like.\nThen in the two smaller rooms you get underground Garage (Dreem\nTeem etc) and the all new\nBreakbeat room( Freestylers) that\none of the promoters that I was\nchatting to seemed very excited\nabout. One of the best things about\nthis club is that even though it's often quite packed and people are\nconstantly moving from one room to another is that there is no standing in queues trying to get here and\nthere you simply step outside walk\ndown the side of the buildings to\nthe room you want then go straight\nin no hassle. With this large outside\narea you can step out and cool off\nand get away from the hectic pace\nof the interior of the club and chill\nfor a bit. There is also a nice spread\nthrough-out the rooms, plenty of\nbars and bar staff, drinks at standard club prices and they have even\ngot friendly ' n' helpful security.\nWhen1 finally found my way to\nthe entrance a small road off Yorke\nWay, Kings Cross right behind the\nstation that is surprisingly un-sign\nposted, all hell seemed to be braking lose. People crazy in' out all over\nthe place and a VW camper van\nwith people jumping about inside\nit, a film crew filming it and some\ngeezer with a flame thrower sort of\nfin g burning up the front screen.\nMost peculiar and I hadn't even got\nin yet. You'll probably see big\nqueues but don't let this put you off\nas they get people in very quickly\nindeed, unless you happen to be on\nthe guest list then you can expect\ntoo spend some time watching the\npaying customers queue disappearing at a phenomenal rate whilst\nyours has only moved two feet. But\nyou can't have your cake and eat or\nsomething!\nOnce inside the massive place\nyou can take your pick from the\nhost of musical styles on show, in\nthe Garage room Mike eB absolutely rinsed the place out dropping\nsome phat slabs of underground\ntwo step business followed by\nColour Girl performing her latest\nrelease Tears (reviewed some weeks back) and the crowd appreciated this girls vocal talents. 100%\nlive - no back dates here and you\nwould not been able to tell the difference between the live perform ance and the record superb\nvoice. In the all new breakbeat\nroom the Freestylers rocked the\nplace with there unique blend of\nnu-skool breaks ' n' beats to not the\nbiggest crowd but a up for it one\nthat appreciated the music.\nI seriously advise you too check\nthis place out, it's a unique venue\nwhich you're very unlikely to find\nanything the host of top DJs and a friendly crowd anywhere else.\nFurther info: 0171 278 2171.\nDon't forget you can catch the\nDree m Teem and the whole 4\nLiberty crew at their end-of-tour\nparty @ Twice As Nice, Londons\nleading Sunday affair on 31 May. A night not to be missed.\njo Public\nCLUB SCENE SINGLES GARAGE\nDecoder & Mark Caro. Eko\n(Tech Itch) 25 May\nTech Itch is one of my favourite\nlabels on the dark side, and they\nare maintaining their run of strong\nreleases with this collaboration\nbetween two outstanding producers in there own right. This has\nbeen ripping up clubs of the likes of\nMetalheadz for a little while now,\ndark melodic hooks 8^ fx run alongside skippy beats and a dark sub\nbass. Flipside hard 'n' intelligent, a12\" you' d be silly to miss.\nSolar Nine. Download\n(Splash Records) 18 May\nThis is a rough tune with big phat\nbeats that just roll along, echoing\nbeats &. spacey fx give it depth and\ntight percussion keep it moving for-ward. A guaranteed crowd please r. Flipside harder not so rolling more\nbroken beats, spooky fx and dark b line and that's just the intro. Badd\ntune.\njust too dark - absolutely tearing.\nThis is such a tune that even thou it\nwas released last week, 1 still heard\nit played down Metalheadz on last\nFriday - the home of up front D&B. Not just one of the best tunes of\nthe year but of all time.\nPeshay. Miles From Home\n(MoWax) Out Now\nI don't know what's going on this\nweek - must be an important date\non the calendar or something. Two\nof the best tunes of past years have\nbeen released over the last few\nweeks. Again a tune your know as\nsoon as it's double bass line drops\nin and that sample from Music Box-Full Cycle. This has been floating around on dub plate for about\none and a half years by my reckoning - so long in fact that 1 though it\nhad already been released and I'd missed it.\nIP\nTrace. Sonar\n(Prototype) Out Now\nThis is a tune your know as soon as\nyou hear the first few echoing keys\nand the smooth break beat. Then\nwhen it drops after the break it'sP). Too Young (FatBoy Rec.)\nThis is the vinyl debut from PJ a12 year old boy from Northampton. In\nthat smooth groove sort of style\nbouncy beats stabs of this 'n' that\nclever arrangements, tough but different sub-bass and soulful male\nvocal stabs complete the package\nnicely. But 1 fail to see how a12 year old kid could have made this,\nI feel it has more to do with Kostas\nP( Kilo Kings) &. James Reynolds\n(London Connection) the engi-ne ers. Sounds a bit like a PR stunt\nto me. But still a good tune.\nChris Mack. Get It (Confetti)\nChris Mack has had a few good tracks out lately and perhaps this\nhas gone to his head a bit and he\nforgot to finish this track before\ngetting it pressed up. No seriously,\nthis is so nearly a wicked track, but\nas I say it sounds unfinished a strange off beat / broken beat style\nthat seems to be missing some\nbeats or something. Trying to hard\nto be different.\nCurtis & Moore. Never Give Up\n(Swing City) 8.5.98\nFour mixes on this one, vocal,\nac capella8. a couple of dub mixes\nto chose from, Bumpin' Dub is the\none that's doing it for me, cuts\ndown the lengthy vocal, strips away\nthe annoying piano and altogether\ntoughens up the beats with a stepping sub bass line to match. In that\nnew style that's coming on strong\nusing stabs of keys it has a light\nuplifting feel, needs to be heard a few times before you appreciate\njust how good this track is.\nGruesome Twosome. Track/More\n(Checkmate Masters)\nThis a superb piece of vinyl containing two tracks with two mixes\nof each. The first tune is Track the\nfirst mix is a slow 2-step sort of\nstyle with old skool over tones but\ndone in a different way to most. A great tune to start your set with\nnice intro and clever beats in the\nchorus that sounds like a2 step\nmeets hip-hop, love it.\n2nd mix is in a harder style and\nit's just as good just a different\nflavour. Flipside More again is in a hard Garage style and just as good as the other side a excellent collection of tracks.\nJP\n\n"

    "content": "8 May 1998 MUSIC\nCLUB SCENE Hi and welcome to the first Electric Cafe of\nthe summer term! If you' re feeling down because of the pressures of exams and final\nreports, etc we'll be bringing you a respite in\nthe form of electronic music news, reviews,\nartist features and some great CD competitions!\nIf you're interested in features that will be\nappearing in the Cafe this term, then look out in\nFelix for exclusive interviews with Colin Dale of\nKiss FM' s Abstrakt Dance show, Russ Gabriel of\nFerox Records, King Kooba (who's album The\nImperial Solution is a storming work of\ndrum'n 'bass and was launched recently at The\nBlue Note in London), Air Liquide (the German\ntechno outfit who played at London's very cool\n333 Club in February) and (to be confirmed) Jeff\nMills, a legendary DJ and producer from Detroit.\nEveryone who features in the Electric Cafe\non these pages will also be doing radio shows\nwhich you can listen to every Sunday\nnight/Monday morning on IC Radio (The\nNetwork) from midnight to 2 am. Happy reading\nand listening!\nThose of you who came down to the Electric\nCafe nights at Southside last term will be interested to know that The Electric Cafe is moving\nacross Campus to IC Union for a special one-off\nsession on Friday 22nd May. I 'll be playing the\nchill-out room of the Hedonizm night. If you're\ninterested in listening and chilling to a variety of\ncutting-edge electronic music, then come along\nfor a break from those exams. The main floor\nwill be in the very capable hands of the regular\nunion dance DJs mixing up a selection of harder\nbeats.\nThis week I wanted to carry on where I left\noff last term. Drum'n 'bass is mainly regarded as\na musical style that was born and bred in the\nUK, and quite rightly so. However, it\nseems that recently there has been a lot of British snobbery directed at\nmusic of this genre that has been\ncoming out of Europe and the US\nlately. If music is really an art form\nthen I think that this is not in the spirit of creation, and not really helping\nyoung producers and DJs who have\nobviously been inspired and moved to carry on the progression of new\nsound form.\nLast term I featured an interview\nfrom Fauna Flash, Germany's most\nsuccessful drum'n 'bass exports who have been largely ignored. This weekend I wanted to talk about a great\nnew album called Play on Sideburn\nRecords.\nPlay is a collection of tracks that\ncan best be categorised as falling\nwithin or being closely aligned to the\ndrum'n 'bass category of electronic\nmusic. All the artists who have contributed tracks come from Switzerland. I think that you would be hard pressed to find a fresher collection of new music. All the pieces\non the album follow the formula of\ndrum'n 'bass or hip-hop, but all have\na distinctly different atmosphere to\nthem. Iam also particularly grateful\nthe electric cam\nto have this album in my collection, because\nunlike a lot of dance fodder around today, this\nis a multi-purpose music. The first techno that\nreally grabbed me was music that I felt had been\ncreated by artists who wanted to move people\nand make them dance, but also wanted to trigger their minds and emotions. All the music you will find on Play is in this vein.\nPlay has been put together by a Zurichbased DJ called Minus 8. Watch out for that\nname because if his mixing is as good as his\ntrack selection then I'm sure that he'll be playing in London soon! Minus 8 also produced\nsome of the tracks featured on the album.\nIn fact the compilation kicks off with a Minus\n8 production called Recently at The Opera. This\nfeatures all the usual hallmarks of drum'n 'bass\nmusic; a solid bassline, frantic bursts of hi-hat\nand complex rhythm patterns. It's what appears\nunderneath the structure of the piece that really\ngrabbed me! I had imagined that this compilation would be made up of some banging tracks\nput together by Swiss kids in their bedroom who had perhaps heard all the more hardcore\ndrum'n 'bass. In fact the maturity and subtlety of\nthe moods of the tracks on offer here are, at\ntimes, simply breathtaking! Recently at the\nOpera features delicate snatches of orchestral\nsamples, infused with light electronic sounds.\nThe result is a moody but extremely listenable\npiece of music.\nThe next track (Not enough Love by M asP), again has an energetic beat and bassline, but\nwith some light and fluffy sounds complementing a female vocal track, the result is a piece that\ncan move your butt, or create a chilled-out\natmosphere.\nAs well as drum'n 'bass, this album features\nsome great hybrid sounds. Twists of hiphop and funk with generous additions of break-beats. Captain Nemo' s Escape is an excellent\nexample. Check out the combination of French\nrag ga vocals and a Spanish guitar! Strange, but it\nworks. Le Gooster has produced a piece called\nLe Fusee a Polo. Some very disturbed and twisted jazz sounds collide and react with a laid-back\nhip-hip beat. Once given the \"Gooster treat-ment\", and mixed with generous portions of live\nscratching you have a track that would sit\nproudly on any beats'n 'blunts album from the\nUK or US.\nOne of my favourite tracks here is from Bel\nAir Project, a personal favourite of DJ Giles\nPeterson. The piece is called Full Contact and is\ncompletely fresh in, not only its sound, but it's approach to the creation of music. It is as if all\nrules and accepted practices were thrown out of\nthe window in the quest for a totally new, don't give-a fuck-sound. This track is definitely ahead\nof the pack; not quite drum'n 'bass, not quite\nbreakbeat s; but who needs to cat ago rise it?; it's a treat to listen to!\nSpacious by Differenz is another awesome\nyet unusual track. If soul music could be translated into computer code then this would be it!\nVery chilled music with plenty of subtle\nmelodies floating around dreamily; all held\ntogether with a strong rhythm. 1 can't easily\ndescribe this track, you'll just have to listen for\nyourselves!\nMinus 8's second track of the album is\ncalled A Touch of Evil. It starts off as atypical. piece of jazzy drum'n 'bass, but then some quite\nabstract and smooth string sounds completely\nturn the trek on its head. Excellent!\nMore drum'n 'bass follows, in the form of\ntracks from Skrupel and The Herbalist\nFoundation P. Brotherhood. 1 was\nparticularly impressed by the work of\nThe Herbalist Foundation. The track\nthey produced is called Summertime\nand, although strictly a drum'n 'bass\naffair, features some really cool blunted effects on the rhythm that\ngives a less clean but more laid-back\nfeel. Not hectic; not booming; this is\nmusic with a groove!\nThe album comes to an end with\ntwo real treats. First Up is AMP's Is\nIsn't,a real techno id piece of d'n'b with some really nice variations in\nrhythm. Again this ties ties in with the\nmood of the album; groovy not slam-ming! 4D from Super is a real trip!\nThis is as experimental as you can\nget in hip-hop, so if you're tired of\nthe same old thing in that genre, do check this out! The track is hypnotic\nand very relaxed with different\nsounds drifting in and out of the\naudio horizon! Very atmospheric\nstuff.\nIf you're looking for something\ndifferent that is pushing forward\nmusical boundaries and that will\nchallenge your tastes, then do check\nout the sound of Switzerland!\nal;ck.\n\n"

Thousands of weak and\nstarving Jewish women and children are forced to march to\nLiepzig, to go across the bridge to\nfreedom. Many never make it;\nsome die of starvation, some of\nexhaustion, those who fall out of\nline are shot or beaten to death.\nThe only food they were given was\na handful of raw rice, which they\nhad to queue for. The only way\nthey survived was through their\nimmense willpower and faith.\nTraumatised for years, the survivors continued to suffer the\nafter-effects of their ordeal. Like in\nthe trenches of the First World\nWar, the lucky ones died.\nThis powerful and evocative\nplay tells the story of two of the\nsurvivors, who meet up for the\nfirst time in the Beth Salom\nHolocaust Memorial Centre fifty-one years. Both are severely trau-mati sed by the terrible experiences\nthey have shared, both denied the\nHolocaust by not speaking about\nit, or admitting that it had happened to them, both are relieved\nto speak to each other, to share\ntheir burdens which no one else\ncould ever comprehend. The play\nrecounts their meeting, through\nlighting, through sound, through\nclever staging. It is a moving experience, and the entire audience\nwas weeping by the end.\nThe sufferings that these people went through cause anything\nwe suffer to pale into almost\ninsignificance. The Holocaust is a period of history that future generations will look back at in disbelief.\nHow did it happen? Why did it\nhappen? The consequences still\nreverberate in the Jewish com m unity today; some wounds never\nheal.\nThe play will cause you to\nthink deeply, to look at your own treatment towards others. We today are fortunate in that we live\nin a time of comparative stability,\nof comparative tolerance towards\nothers, especially in this country. It\nis vital that we maintain this stability, however precarious it might\nseem, lest we fall prey to a new\nregime of dictators. Please go and\nsee this play, it is so important to\neveryone. It is not strictly enjoy-able, but it will give you much to\nthink about.\nJulia H BOTTLED NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND:\nCONTEMPORARY PLAYS BY JEWISH WRITERS\nIn my vain attempts to broaden\nmy mind, I read all of these\nplays at a sitting, in bed whilst\nnursing a hangover. By the end of\nthe book, I was not only feeling\nbetter, but I had far more of an idea\nabout the Jewish condition, if I can\ncall it that. For all my studying of\nGCSE history, 1 really had no idea of\nthe impact that the Holocaust had\non people's lives, nor how bad the\ntroubles in Israel really were for the\npeople living there. Now, with\nIsrael celebrating 50 years of self-determination, and rumours of a possible peace settlement in the\nwind, it seems pertinent to write\nabout the current state of Israel\nand Jewish people.\nSince I started reading Brecht\nduring last summer, I have become increasingly more interested in\nJewish writers and writings.\nObviously, no people can escape\ntheir past, and the great strength\nand courage of German, Austrian\nand Polish Jews never ceases to\namaze me. The tortures they suffered were immense, and still\nreverberate in the community today, both in the survivors and in\ntheir children.\nEach of the featured playwrights are award-winning writers\nin their field. Sonja Linden, one of\nthe playwrights, the author of The\nJewish Daughter, featured in Felix\n1101, has written a passionate and\ndifficult play, called Strange\nPassenger, about the life of the\ncomposer Victor Ullman. This play\nis multi-faceted, and extremely\ncomplicated, as well as being\nexcellent.\nThe most amusing play is a black comedy by David Scheider\ncalled The Eleventh\nCommandment, about a good Jewish boy, who falls for an atheist\ngirl. Concerning the relationship\nwith his mother, this is a funny and\nintelligent debut play, with surreal\naspects generally only found in\nTom Stoppard's works.\nMy favourite play was the first\none, The Yiddish Trojan Women,\nconcerning the relationship\nbetween four women, a grand-mother, a stand-up comic, a unionist and a teacher of Greek\nMythology. This play by Carole\nBraverman, revives the tragic classical story by Euripides, but sets it\nin modern New York.\nAll the works in this book are\nsensitively written, thoughtful,\npoignant and in places, extremely\nfunny. I don't know if many would\nbe interested in this book, all I can\ndo is to tell you about it, and help\npublicise future performances. The\nworks are worth getting to know:\nthe Holocaust was a such a huge\npart of our history, and a terrible\nexample of man's inhumanity to\nman. I think that Jewish people\nwould appreciate these plays the\nmost, but 1 think that everyone\nshould become familiar with some\nJewish writers, in order to appreciate a different slant on life.\nJulia H For more information, contact me\nat the Felix Office\nSMALL ADS\nMusicals\nThe Barbican are showing \"lost\nmusicals\" as part of their\nInventing America season.\nComposers include George and\nIra Gershwin, Cole Porter and\nStephen Sondheim. I 've got more\ndetails in the Felix Office, so come\nin and ask if you're interested.\nJazz\nDeborah Harry and the Jazz\nPassengers are at the Barbican on\n28 May. They are fantastic, so\nhurry up and get your tickets\nbefore they're all sold out.\nAlthough now: The Tide is High,\nbut I'm Holding On (Arts Editor\ncarted off by men in white coats\nburbling about hair-dye)\nHelp!!\nWanted: More arts reviewers.\nEveryone has exams, especially\nme, and I need some dedicated\npeople interested in other things\nas well as their degrees to come and go to plays and art galleries,\nand then write about them. Postgrads and medics especially\nwanted, but anyone interested\nshould come into the Felix Office\nand either ask for Julia, or email\nme on felix@ic.ac.uk.\n\n"

    "content": "8 May 1998 BOOKS\nFICTION SUCKER\nLana Citron\nHonesty is always the best\npolicy, and not wishing to\ndeceive the gentle reader,\nI 'll say what 1 think about this book\nstraight away. This book is really\npoor.\nPeople are interlinked. Bea's best friend shagged Bea's boyfriend's best mate, who's defending Bea's boyfriend's ex-flat-mate on a charge of raping someone who just might turn out to be\nBea's best friend, who picks up\nmen at random, who lives with her\nsugar daddy, who's wife's best\nfriend's godson is accused of raping\nBea's best friend, who recently\nappeared, in her scanties, in a series of articles about so-called\nrape victims by Bea's slimy, treacherous ex-boyfriend, who knows\nBea's boyfriend's current flat mate, who bet Bea's boyfriend that he,\nBea's boyfriend's current flat mate, could bed Bea's unattractive flat-mate, who is a psychic in her spare\ntime and told Bea that her future\ninvolved two men, so now Bea's sure that her current boyfriend who she loves will dump her, and that\nher slimy, treacherous ex-boyfriend, who she doesn't love,\nwill shag her and dump her again.\nThe book, however, doesn't make\nthis as clear as it is here.\nSucker is a first novel about\nLondon and 90's Londoners. Two\nof the protagonists are IrishCatholic girls, presumably like Lana\nCitron, and the others can loosely\nbe described as their men. Obviously, Sucker doesn't refer to\ncute little girls with lollipops,\nalthough the heroine does dress up\nto attract semi-pae do phil ic men by\nwearing a tight tee-shirt and hair\nslides. She pulls a yo b, apparently\nher type, although I preferred the\nsophistication of Bea's boyfriend's divorced best friend, who I think\nshe ends up with. 1 don't want to\nspoil the ending for you, though.\nAccording to the press release,\nthe book tears a strip off the pretensions of 1990s twenty-some-things, and provides a blistering\ninsight into the dating game and\nthe darker side of the sex-war. By\nthat, I think they mean that one of\nthe girls isn't afraid to use her sexuality as a weapon, and the other is\nkeener to shack up/marry someone and give up thinking. I preferred the\npowerful one, although I kept on\nwanting to tell her to grow up. Oh well. Obviously I'm part of the pretentious media/PR world that Ms Citron is so keen to distance herself\nfrom.\nThis isn't really a great book. It's quite well written, and it's certainly\nboth confusing and entertaining, as\nwell as being fast-paced and effortlessly modern in it's style. With\nsummer coming up, and the mass\nexodus of sun-seekers, it'll probably\nsell well to the reading on the\nbeach public. I wouldn't recommend it as a serious piece of fiction\nfor the discerning reader, though. If\nyou buy it, then you're the sucker\nand deserve everything you get.\nYou have been warned.\nJulia H and Ben A( guess which bits he wrote)\nPublished by Random House,\n\u00a3 9 . 9 9\nAvailable: Now EVERYTHING WE LOVE CAN BE SAVED\nAlice Walker\nYTiiiNG WE lov t:(.; AS\nm lice Walker is a writer of\nintegrity; a woman is t, an\ni. activist, a believer in the\nGoddess and a truly wonderful,\nbeautiful person. Her writing covers\na great deal, from fiction to essays,\nprose to poetry. Most people will\nbe familiar with at least the title of\nher most famous book, The Colour\nPurple, a semi-biographical story of\nwomen of colour in the American\nDeep South. This was later made\ninto a film by Steven Spielberg,\nstarring another wonderful woman of colour, Whoopi Goldberg.\nIn this collection of essays, she\nwrites about a wide spectrum of\ntopics, essays on the Gulf War,\nfemale genital mutilation, Winnie\nMandeta, Fidel Castro, dreadlocks\nand her cat. She includes some poetry, in a selection entitled \"What\nCan I Give My Daughters Who Are\nBrave?\". The poems she chooses\nare poignant and have echoes in all\nour lives. Every sentence she writes\nshows her humanity, her compassion and her believe in the deep\ngood of people, despite all the evils\nshe sees in life; racism, sexism and\noppression.\nAs a woman of colour growing\nup in the American Deep South\nduring the period of American apartheid, she knew poverty, violence and discomfort. Yet she also\nknew love and tolerance. Her\nmother was clearly a potent force\nin her life, and her death obviously\nhad a great effect on her. Many of\nher essays feature a caring mother-figure, who nurtures and protects,\nand stress her importance in all our\nlives. Our mothers teach us how to\nlive, and how to die.\nAlice Walker doesn't like to be\ncalled a feminist, preferring woman is t, because she acts for women. She is acutely aware of the dangers\nto women of a patriarchal, or a male dominated society. Whereever women are suppressed or\noppressed, she will be there speaking out for them. She is a strong\ncritic of American foreign policies,\nespecially their blockade of Cuba\nand the Gulf War. As she says, \"If I would rather die myself than run\nover a child in the street, how can 1\npossibly accept squashing a million\nchildren from forty thousand feet,\nas in Iraq?\"\nThis is not a \"mainstream\" book.\nIt will not appeal to many of you at\nfirst glance. Reading it, however,\nyou feel its' power, and its' passion.\nThis book is extremely important to\nwomen, to men, to everyone who thinks and feels, and who can see\nthe injustices in the world. I was\nprofoundly moved by many of her\nessays, and found myself laughing\naloud over others. This book will\nmake you want to be a better,\nmore thoughtful, more caring per-son. I strongly recommend it.\nJulia H Published by the Women's Press\nPrice 31 1.99\nAvailable: Now "

Chris \"lightweight\"\nDickinson, initiated and finished off\na well worked try which easily\nfoiled the defence, resulting in a seven pointer that any team would\nbe proud of. A quick pick up and lightning acceleration from Telfa\n\"you smell\" Beynon confirmed our\nplace in the final against London\nExiles 1.\nThe game started well by \"slight\nof frame\" scoring within 5 seconds,\nand Telfa the cheetah sold more\ndummies than Mother Care to score a superb individual try.

A badly played struck hl ra on the forehead and knocked him unconscious for two minutes. When he came round he appeared to be reasonably uninjured, apart from a spreading purple bruise and a touch of amnesia. His teammates though the didn't need a doctor and told him togo home and lie down. This he did and Immediately fell Into a coma like sleep, not reawakening for thirty six hours. When he finally reopened his eyes under beneath the watchful gaze of my grandmother he complained of a crippling head ao he and a bizarre defect in his vision. Two days later, at the local hospital, he was diagnosed as having the very rare condition of a chroma to psi a. He had lost the ability to see colour. My grandfather, a great fan of French painting, was plunged Into an alien world filled with shades of grey and abhorrent black. It was a world he never left again until his death. Following the accident he suffered massive depressions and became very seriously ill for many months. However, he was a very strongman with a legendary determination and he recovered. For a time he could eat only food that appeared natural to him, such as black olives, yoghurt, white rice, black coffee, but this effect gradually disappeared. He removed every painting from his vicinity and replaced them with sombre black and white pictures; art galleries he never entered again. He used to wear green sunglasses to improve the contrast of his vision and accentuate perception of boundaries and form. Those sunglasses were one of the many fascinating Idiosyncrasies of my grandfather, many of which branded him an eccentric In some peoples' eyes, but never so in mine. My grandfather died at the age of81. I was14 years old. He suffered a stroke, which left him comatose. Briefly before the heart atta ok which killed him, however, he was conscious, for one precious hour. By some divine coincidence my family was present in his hospital room as he was awake and it is a brief moment In my life I will never f' details of the room will remain with me always: its intrinsic sterility which all my mothers flowers could nev pel, the somehow pleasant but frightening smell of antiseptic soap, the low murmur of activity in the corridor side. Most vividly, though, my grandfather himself. Propped upon pillows, his face still exuding humour, con! love of life, untouched by morbidity, but more than this, the fact that he was crying. It was never established what happened in his head the day it was struck by the cricket ball. The brain! fantastically Intricate than can be imagined, and its workings will remain Impenetrable to science for along come. Maybe a handful of microscopic neurone s lost their lifelong contact with one another, or possibly at in burst, starving some vital nerve complex of blood. What13 certain, however, is that the stroke undid what eve cricket ball had done, and for his last waking hour my grandfather saw the world again in colour. He wept at the sensations he had forgotten over27 years, unashamedly and before us all. It was some th ln deeply shocked me at that age. How oo ul d my grandfather, the paradigm of self control, lose his composure so was embarrassed for him, so much so that I could not meet his eyes.

    "content": "8 May 1998 COLUMNS\nBy the time this hits the news-stands, a large number of you will\nhave voted in the local elections\nand the mayoral referendum. Despite the fact that 1 know that\nyou hang on my every word, there\nis little point in trying to influence\nyou after the event. The elections,\nhowever, coincide with Labour's first anniversary, and since the\nworld and his wife are expressing\nan opinion, I would hate to be left\nout.\n1 must admit that the first year\nof New Labour has not been as\ndisastrous as previous Labour\nadministrations. Economic chaos\nhas not ensued, though elements\nof their budgets, such as the windfall tax, have proved less than\ndesirable. Bank of England independence is something that the\nConservatives should have implemented years ago, and is to be\ncongratulated. Many of the\nEducation initiatives are also to be\ncongratulated, though one has a sense of deja-vu with much of\nDavid Blunkett's policy. The moves\ntowards peace in Northern Ireland,\nbuilding on the foundations laid by\nJohn Major, are excellent, if fraught\nwith difficulty. However, all is not\nquite so rosy, if you'll forgive the\npun. We have a government of\nunprecedented arrogance commanded by a man who has delusions of presidency. The spin doc tor has been raised to messianic\nstatus, with the creeping politic is a tion of the Civil Service. New Labour spoke at length of Christian\nfamily values in their manifesto,\nwhich has sown the seeds of the\npatronising, infuriating puritanism\nthat is so wonderfully exemplified\nby the beef on the\nbone ban. We have a government that was elected partly on an anti-sleaze\nticket, which accepted \u00a31 million from Bernie\nEcclestone and, in\na totally unconnected action,\nexempted Formula One from a tobacco advertising ban. We have\nLabour MPs facing criminal\ncharges for election fraud, both in\nScotland and England. Such is\nTony Blair's obsession with popularity that he has backed away\nfrom or watered down much of the\nvery good welfare reform proposed by Frank Field, a man told to\n'think the unthinkable', now limited to thinking whatever Alistair\nCampbell tells him. We are represented on the international stage\nby a loutish Foreign Secretary, who despite so much promise in opposition has shown that the only\ndepartment briefs he has mastered are those belonging to his\nsecretary. The calibre of some of\nthe Cabinet is so low, as in the\ncase of Harriet\nHarman, that\nMandelson and Campbell resorted to bullying\nRadio Four over\nft1 the behaviour of\n_J John Humphreys. This\nbehaviour, taken\nP\"\"\"] with innumerable other in ci dents, gives cr-e Cl\" den ce to the\nidea that, for all the affability of\nBlair, this is a government that is\nbecoming ever more aloof and self-obsessed.\nWhile we're on the subject of\nelections, something rather worrying occurred to me earlier this\nweek. As many of you will know,\nit's all change for the way Imperial\nis governed. Outgoes the\nGoverning Body to be replaced by\na Court and Council. ICU will get\nmore representation on the enlarged Court, with\nplaces for the President\nand six others. These will principally consist of the C CU Presidents\nand a Deputy President or two to\nmake the numbers up. This is\nwhere alarms bells started ringing.\nWhat we are proposing is that the\ninterests of 1C students are to be\nrepresented by the Presidents of\nRCSU, C8.G etc. AmI alone in\nbeing somewhat unnerved by this\nprospect? The C&.G President\nhardly acquitted himself well this\nyear, and the prospect of my interests being protected by the\nPresident of the RCSU fills me with\nhorror.
