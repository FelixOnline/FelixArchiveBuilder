    "content": "The government crusade to force\nuniversities to return to in-person\nteaching continued last week, as\nUniversities Minister Michelle Donelan\nsaid that universities may receive\nvisits by officials from the Office for\nStudents, to assess staff attendance rates.\nSpeaking to The Mail on Sunday,\nDonelan said that she had \u201cnot\nheard a reasonable rationale\u201d for why\nstudents would still need to receive\nteaching remotely, where it was\ndone in person before the pandemic.\n\u201cStudents and lecturers will be going\nto the pub, going out for meals, they\u2019ll\nbe going to parties, going to weddings,\nprobably concerts, so it doesn\u2019t\nactually make sense that they can\u2019t\nthen be in a lecture theatre\u201d she added.\nSanctions for institutions not\nadhering to the government\u2019s\nstandards risk being fined, with \u201cthe\nmost serious ramification\u201d being\nthe loss of \u201cability to access money\nfrom the student loan system\u201d.\nIt is unclear why the minister cannot\njust ask the universities in question to\nself-report the number of staff working\non campus on a given day, as with every\nother metric. It is also unclear how Ms\nDonelen expects a small number of\nofficials to build an accurate picture\nof staff attendance from a single visit,\nespecially when some universities are\nsprawled across multiple campuses.\nThe news follows Education\nSecretary Nadhim Zahawi\u2019s call for\nuniversities to return to in-person\nteaching, in January this year.\nImperial College has been praised\nImperial College has been selected\nas the host of the UK branch of\nthe NATO innovation headquarters.\nNATO\u2019s innovation programme,\nthe Defence Innovation Accelerator\nfor the North Atlantic (DIANA), is\njointly hosted by the UK and Estonia\nand will encourage \u201ctransatlantic\ncooperation on critical technologies\nand help NATO work more closely\nwith industry and academia\u201d,\naccording to the UK government\nwebsite.

However, more disguised\nand far more sinister is dissent\noccurring not just close to home,\nbut within the ranks of the EU and\nNATO. Hungary\u2019s populist President\nViktor Orban is currently\nthe EU\u2019s longest serving\nleader, and at the beginning\nof April won a landslide\nfourth election, giving\nhis Fidesz party a two-thirds supermajority\nin the country\u2019s\nparliament. As early\nas 2014, Orban\u2019s second\nelection, the Organisation for\nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe\ndescribed the ballot as \u201cfree but not\nfair\u201d due to the playing field being\nextremely un-even, with Orban\u2019s\ngovernment influencing much of\nthe media, confidential campaign\nspending and bias in public life.\nMaybe Orban\u2019s recent win is not\nthe result of manipulation but of\ngenuine support by the Hungarian\nelectorate.Afterall,weareinthemidst\nof a global cost of living crisis, and\nwhen times are hard countries often\nbecome more insular, and populism\nis flourishing across much of Europe.\nHowever,thecaseinotherEuropean\ncountries appear markedly different\nwhen compared with Hungary. Polls\nsuggest that 25% of Fidesz party\nvoters think the war in Ukraine is\nUkraine\u2019s fault. By contrast, a YouGov\npoll in February shows that just 1% of\nBrits see Russia as \u2018generally a friend\nand ally\u2019. It is, of course, unclear\nhow much of this opinion is altered\nby the Hungarian government\u2019s\npro-Russia messaging on state TV,\nhowever it would be surprising\nto learn that this had no effect.\nThe EU is a collection of\ndemocracies, founded on \u2018freedom,\ndemocracy, equality, the rule of law\nand respect for human rights\u2019. Orban,\nby contrast, runs what The Times\ndescribesasa\u2018populistkleptocracyand\nelective dictatorship\u2019. Orban himself is\na proponent of \u2018illiberal democracy\u2019.\nThe country is notably hostile towards\nLGBT people, with the EU having\nalreadyvotedinfavouroftakingaction\nover Hungarian laws that marginalise\nthem. Orban has been accused\nconsistently of commandeering EU\nfunds, which account for as much as\n5% of Hungary\u2019s GDP, to\nfinance personal projects\nand make his associates\nricher.Hehasbuiltbotha\nfootball stadium in, and a\ndirectrailwayto,hishome\nvillage, which at the time\nhad a population of around\n1,800 people. The railway\nconnects his home village to another,\nand carries about a thousandth of\nthe number of passengers \u2018predicted\u2019\nwhen funding was allocated. He used\n\u20ac2 million in EU funds to do this.\nThe recently changed constitution\nnow makes it legally harder for\nopposition parties to succeed; the\nswamp needs far more than draining.\nHungary relies on Russia for 85%\nof its gas. Orban attacked Zelensky\nin his victory speech in April. He\nrefused to allow arms shipments in\nsupport of Ukraine to pass through\nHungarian territory. If Orban had just\nkept his head down and taken a neutral\nstance without saying anything, this\nwould probably have blown over\nwithin the EU, but he is all but a\nPutin ally without saying it out loud.\nNot to mention Hungary\u2019s NATO\nmembership; there\u2019s not a snowball\u2019s\nchance in hell that Hungary would\nrespect Article 5, \u2018an attack on one\nis an attack on all\u2019, if it came to it.\nSo, you may wonder, why is\nHungary still in the EU? Because there\nis no legal way of removing a country\nfrom the EU! The most that can\nhappen is an embargo on EU funds to\nthe country, which the Commission\nis in the process of enacting. This\nneeds to change. There is no place for\nparasites in the defence of Ukraine.\nHungary\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

The event was\nrevived in 2022 over a period of four\ndays, and found internet communities\ncongregating and working together to\npromote themselves. By the last day, few\nuniversities had been represented on\nthe final canvas, the demand for space\nbeing extremely competitive. Here is\nthe story of how a small group of Imperial users were able to secure a place\nand earn the College a little spot in internet history. The first Imperial logo\nwas created by a few anonymous Design Engineering students, and gained\ntraction after being mentioned on Imperial Secrets. With more people aware\nof the project, it could grow beyond its\nhumble 5x5 size. However, with larger\nborders came increased competition.\nWhen supporters of the political party\nLa France Insoumise began constructing\na tortoise in our vicinity, we quickly lost\nground \u2013 but on the third day, an expansion of the canvas and a new dedicated\nDiscord server provided an opportunity\nfor relocation and better coordination.\nThemovewasgoingwellwiththenew\n14x14 logo nearing completion.

We were grossly outnumbered\nand losing faith. However, to our right,\nwe noticed a beacon of hope: the H3H3\nPodcast. We quickly formed an unex-pectedalliancewithitsviewers,andwere\nnow under the protection of thousands.\nThe Imperial logo was not only repaired,\nbut our borders widened as our alliances\ngrew to include Pok\u00e9mon and Tamagotchi fans. With their help, the logo survived the night. Soon enough we were in\na position to build the famous Queen\u2019s\nTower accompanied by the library. We\nwere a stone castle, and our enemies\nwere mere wooden arrows. The empire\nwas undefeatable. Or so we thought\u2026\nOn the final evening, the colourful\nspectrum of placeable pixels suddenly\nbecame white. The canvas started dissolving before our very eyes\nand soon enough the Imperial logo\nhad disappeared into the night.\nIt was an artistic end to an artistic\nmasterpiece, and if one thing was\naccomplished during this event, it\nwas the four-day intense procrastination and entertainment this journey had gifted us. A twisted victory.\nICL's moment of fame on r/place\nOscar O'Flanagan Science Writer\nIsabelle Mattia Science Writer\nXiang Yan Science Writer\nThis week in Science...\nClean water at the push of a button\nPterosaurs may have had bright feathers on their heads\nMagic mushrooms \u201copen up\u201d depressed brains\nMIT researchers have built a portable desalination unit that generates\nclean drinking water. It removes particles and salts simultaneously using\nion concentration polarisation, by which an electric field is applied\nfrom above and below a channel of water to repel both positive and\nnegatively charged species, which include salt, bacteria and viruses. This\neliminates the need for high-pressure pumps and filters, which affect the\ntransportability and cost of filters. It requires less power to operate than\na cell phone charger, and at under 10kg, it has a lot of potential to be\ntransported to remote locations.\nA new analysis of an 113 million year-old Pterosaur fossil revealed it had\ntwotypesoffeathers.Thesewereindicatedbywhisker-likesinglefilaments,\nand more complicated branching structures. They have thin films that\nallow them to fly and so do not require feathers for flight, which suggests\nthey were present for warmth and visual signalling, such as attracting a\nmate. This settles a long-running debate over whether Pterosaurs had true\nfeathers. As dinosaurs also had feathers, they could have had a common\nancestor that evolved feathers, which pushes back the estimated origin of\nfeathers by around 100 million years to 250 million years ago.\nAnalysis of fMRI brain scans from close to 60 people has revealed that\npsilocybin,thepsychedeliccompoundfoundinmagicmushrooms,'opens\nup' depressed people\u2019s brains.

The first diamond in the\nregion of what became Kimberley was\nfound in 1869. Geoffrey Wheatcroft,\nauthor of The Randlords, states \u201cUntil\nthat moment it is hard to exaggerate\nhow remote, how poor, how unimpor-tant, and how empty South Africa was\u201d.\nThejourneytoKimberleyfromthecoast\ntook two weeks by ox-cart. Julius Wernher arrived there in 1873, aged 23, and\nAlfred Beit in 1875, aged 22.\nIn my own contribution to the History Group dialogue I wrote quite a lot\non the history of Kimberley because the\ncharge against Alfred Beit was on \u201cthe\ntreatment of workers during the expansion of the Kimberley mines\u201d. But Beit\nHall and Beit Quad are in fact named\nafter Alfred Beit\u2019s younger brother, Sir\nOtto Beit, who had rather little to do\nwith Kimberley. The picture shows the\nplaque to Sir Otto near the entrance to\nBeit Quad.\nI have found the history of Kimberley\nfascinating, reflecting a lifelong interest\nand love for sub-Saharan Africa (I was\nraised in Nigeria, and later worked in\nMalawi and Gabon). The Randlords is\none of the best sources on the history of\nSouth Africa\u2019s mines. In fact, I also corresponded with Geoffrey Wheatcroft in\nthe checking of details. Another good\n(and positively reviewed) book is Patrick Harries\u2019 (1994): Work, Culture, and\nIdentity: Migrant Laborers in Mozambique and South Africa, c. 1860-1910.\nAlso, a colourful eyewitness account of\nthe early days at Kimberley written by\nAnthony Trollope is worth seeking out.\nIactuallythinkthatthechargeagainst\nAlfred Beit is mistaken, and I will say a\nlittlebitaboutitherebeforereturningto\nOtto Beit at the end. You can find more\ndetails in my essay which I published at\nQuillette (simply Google \u2018Quillette Stephen Warren\u2019 to find it). Conditions in\nthe (later) Rand gold mines were not as\ngood as those at Kimberley, and this became a concern of Julius Wernher. The\nsystem at Kimberley was seen as a model\nto emulate, particularly after improvements were made to reduce overcrowding in 1903. Wages were also lower in\nthe Rand gold mines. The wages at Kimberley were the highest in South Africa,\nand Harries states \u201cIt was with some justification that the manager of De Beers\nclaimed in 1888 that \u2018our natives are\nbetter paid than the miners in any of the\nEuropean countries\u2019 \u201d.\nSegregationbyraceactuallyhappened\nbefore Alfred Beit arrived at Kimberley\nand was forced on the authorities by an\narmed uprising of the diggers, the Black\nFlag rebellion.\nThe problem of labourers secreting\ndiamonds often by swallowing them\nwas never completely solved. Before the\ncompounds were implemented it is estimated that about one-third of diamonds\nwere removed from Kimberley in this\nway. In the compounds, at the end of\ntheir stay, labourers were isolated, strip\nsearched, and purged with castor oil.\nThe scale of the problem is shown by the\nfact that this process yielded an average\nof 100,000 carats a year.\nThe compounds were a major improvement compared to the disorganised and unhealthy conditions that\nexisted in the early years of Kimberley.\nThey provided good sanitation, washing facilities, dormitories, a refectory, a\nhospital, a chapel, and some organised\nsport. Nevertheless, until the improvements of 1903, overcrowding was certainly a problem that led to an excess of\ndeaths from pneumonia (a consequence\nof the hot conditions underground). After1903themortalityratebecamelower\nthan in the town of Kimberley itself.\nReferring to the compounds, the editors of the missionary publication Outlook wrote in 1906 \u201cThe de Beers Company have set an example of just and\nreasonable treatment of their Native employees\u201d. Even more positively, another\nvisitor to Kimberley in 1906 wrote that\nhe considered the compound system\n\u201cas near perfection as it was possible to\nmake it\u201d.

However, this comes\nat a price. Any attachments you might have must cease\nto exist. But what good is the family unit when the\nstate can provide all your needs? What good are long-term relationships when you can\nengage in copious recreational\nsex? Brave New World presents\nthe reader with a seemingly great\nutopia, underpinned by a dark\nand grim reality.\nThe main tool of oppression\nused in Brave New World is\nsensuality \u2014 recreational sex,\nhallucinogenic drugs, and feelies\n(pornography which can be seen,\nheard, and felt). In contrast to brute military force,\nsensuality is a deceptive, insidious form of oppression\n\u2014 it distracts the masses from their pitiable state and\nrenders them physically and mentally incapable of\nfighting back.\nSimilarly, in the real world, hook-ups, recreational\ndrugs, and online pornography are spreading like\ncancer amongst Western youth. Despite the standard\nof living in the West being higher than anywhere else\nin the world, it seems that escapist outlets are being\nsought out at an unprecedented rate. This rise of sensual escapism is indicative of a crumbling moral fibre.\nMoreover, dictatorships run rampant in the East.\nMost of these consist of a police state, a military supervision of the life of each individual in the country.\nBut military might alone is not sufficient to rule over a\npeople. In the face of unfavourable odds, people have,\nand people will, mount an armed resistance to op-pression. Breaking the will of the oppressed, and using\nsensuality as a tool to do so, is key to achieving total\ndomination.\nAnother prediction made by\nHuxley is that social mobility\nwould cease to exist. There are\nfive castes in Brave New World:\nalphas and betas, which serve\nas society\u2019s intellectuals; and\ngammas, deltas, and epsilons,\nwhich serve as manual labourers.\nEach individual in Brave New\nWorld is manufactured on an\nassembly line which is unique\nto each caste. For example, the\nfoetus of an epsilon would be imbibed with alcohol\nand deprived of oxygen to stunt\ntheir physical growth and lower\ntheir intelligence. An epsilon would\ntherefore lack the faculties required\nfor social ascendancy, and an alpha\nwould maintain his status as a result\nof this.\nThe American dream \u2014 the right\nof each American to pave their way\nin life \u2014 attracted millions of immigrants across the Atlantic in the 19th\nand 20th centuries. Carnegie and\nRockefeller were titans of American\nindustry and are cited as proof that\neven the lowliest man can make his\nway. However, two individuals do\nnot represent 300 million. For most\nAmericans; 99% of Americans; the\npaths of Carnegie and Rockefeller\nare distant and elusive.\nThings do not look much different on this side of the Atlantic.\nPrivately educated individuals make\nup the bulk of the cabinet, the\nbulk of partners at city law firms,\nand disproportionately attend top\nuniversities. The establishment of a Huxley-type class\nsystem, in which social mobility is non-existent, is\nnot out of the question. Whilst Huxley\u2019s world is\nintelligence-based \u2014 the more intelligent you are, the\nhigher your socioeconomic position \u2014 the real-world\nis inheritance-based \u2014 the better off your parents are,\nthe better off you will be.\nOverall, I must admit that Huxley\u2019s world is attractive \u2014 superficially so \u2014 perhaps more attractive\nthan periods in our history. But a world that represses\nthe very things that make us human \u2014 our desire to\npursue our own interests, to form meaningful relation-ships, and to fulfil our God-given potential \u2014 is not\none that I would want to live in.\nBrave New World\nBook Review\nJustin Macharia Books Writer\n\u201c\nTHIS RISE OF\nSENSUAL ESCAPISM\nIS INDICATIVE\nOF A CRUMBLING\nMORAL FIBRE\n\u201c\nI MUST ADMIT\nTHAT HUXLEY\u2019S\nWORLD IS\nATTRACTIVE \u2014\nSUPERFICIALLY\nSO\nCredit: Guy Barzilay, UnSplash\n\n"

    "content": "Alfred Henry Sturtevant was an\nAmerican scientist born in Illinois\nin 1891. His father was a maths teacher\nbut he quit his job to start a farm, where\nhe bred horses. Sturtevant was fascinat-edbyhowthetraitsofhorseswereinher-ited by their offspring. This enormously\ninfluenced his career. He went to the\nUniversity of Columbia, where he took\na biology introductory course given by\nDr Thomas Hunt Morgan, who was\nstudying the mechanism of inheritance\nin fruit flies. Thomas Morgan was a key\ngeneticist of the 20th\ncentury because he\nshowedthatthechromosome-structures\nthat carry DNA in cells - was the basic\nunit of inheritance. Sturtevant was astonished by Thomas Morgan\u2019s class, and\nsent him a paper about the mechanisms\nof inheritance in the horses he saw during his childhood. Morgan, impressed\nwith Sturtevant\u2019s work, offered him a\nposition in his lab in 1910. There, he and\nThomas Morgan spent hours breeding\nthousands of flies and recording their\noffspring\u2019s traits. One day, Sturtevant\ntook home the huge stack of papers containing their data, and worked through\nthe night drawing the first genetic map\nat the astonishingly young age of 19!\nBut what is exactly a genetic map?\nFirst, let's give a bit of biological back-ground. DNA encodes for proteins,\nwhich express our traits such as the colour of the eyes, or our height. When a\ncell is getting ready to reproduce and\nsplit into two, DNA is first packaged in\nhighly condensed structures called chro-mosomes. The chromosomes look like\n\u2018sticks\u2019, and the genes are linearly located in specific locations of those \u2018sticks\u2019\ncalled loci. Different parts of the chromosomes have different genes. Due to\nthe linear distribution of genes along the\nchromosome, some genes are closer to\neach other than other genes.\nNowadays, it is relatively easy to find\nout a gene\u2019s location thanks to the development of genome sequencing techniques and bioinformatics that allow\nus to sequence the entire genome of\nan organism and track the location of\nits genes. However, there were no ul-tra-powerful computers in Sturtevant\u2019s\ntime. \u201cMapping\u201d the locations of genes\nrequired diligent study of the traits of\nthat offspring inherited from their par-ents. Traits that tend to pass to offspring\ntogether are more likely to be linked to\ngenes closer to each other in the chro-mosome. Using this information, we can\nfind out the relative positions of genes.\nThis works because of how genes are\npassed onto offspring. This is explained\nthrough meiosis and recombination.\nMeiosis is a process by which a parent\u2019s genes are distributed into gametes\n(in humans, gametes are sperm or egg\ncells). The gametes of the opposite sex\nfuse with each other during fertilisation\nand create what is known as a zygote\ncell, which eventually develops into an\nindividual. In meiosis, the amount of\nDNA found in a parent\u2019s cell is divided\nin half to make the gamete. This means\nthat when gametes fuse, the amount of\nDNA in the resulting zygote is the typical amount of DNA found in the cells\nof your fully-grown body. For example,\nhumans have 46 chromosomes in their\ncells, but human gametes have only 23\nchromosomes. When a sperm and egg\nfuse, each one contributes 23 chromosomes to the final zygote, so that 23 + 23\n= 46 chromosomes. This ensure that the\nfuture offspring will have the same number of chromosomes as their parents.\nHaving explained the significance of\nmeiosis, we must explain its signature\nevent: crossing over. DNA is packaged\ninto chromosomes: 23 inherited from\na sperm, 23 from an egg. These chromosomes pair up into homologous\nchromosomes. These pairs contain the\nsame genetic information, which interact to give you a certain trait. For ex-ample, your mother could have given\nyou a \u201cblue\u201d eye colour gene, and in the\nequivalent chromosome from your fa-ther, you could have received a \u201cbrown\u201d\neye colour gene. You would end up with\nbrown eyes as this gene is more strongly\nexpressed, but you still have both copies\nof the gene. During crossing over, these\nchromosomes come together and \u201cswap\u201d\nfragments of each other, to create completely unique chromosomes that can\npass on to your offspring. Genes that are\ncloser together are less likely to be split\nup during crossing over. The traits that\nthey influence are therefore more likely\nto appear together in offspring. Genes\nthat are further away from each other are\nmore likely to be split up during crossing over, and so you will be less likely\nto see their traits together in offspring.\nImagine two people are holding onto a\npieceofropethathasbeenstretchedout.\nIf you take a pair of giant scissors and\ncut the rope at a random spot, you are\nmuch less likely to separate the people if\nthey\u2019re close together than if they\u2019re far\napart. Note that crossing over is a random event that can happen to any part\nof a chromosome. Sturtevant studied\nthe fly traits that tended to be inherited\ntogether, and based on how frequently\ncertain traits were inherited together or\nseparately, he drew the first gene map of\na chromosome, and revolutionised the\nfield of genetics.\nNowadays, knowing a gene's location\nmeans that you can find out the gene\nsequence and location of, for example,\na genetic disease. Then, you might be\nable to use some genetic engineering\ntool to target and repair that DNA se-quence, curing the disease. This is one of\nthe many applications of gene mapping,\nwhich all started with a 19-year old undergraduate student.\nFRIDAY 6TH MAY 2022\nSCIENCE\n5\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nHow an undergraduate changed our\nunderstanding of genetics overnight\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nEXPLAINER BOX\n1) The DNA in a cell is duplicated, copying the chromosomes\n2) Chromosomes pair up with their homologous chromosomes\n3) Chromosomes \"swap\" fragments with their homologous chromosome in a process called crossing over\n4) The homologous chromosomes are split and divided evenly when the cells splits into two\n5) The chromosomes are split in two, so each gamete (egg or sperm) contains different genetic information,\nallowing offspring to have variety.

    "content": "7\nThere is something antiquated about David Hare\u2019s\nnew play Straight Line Crazy at the Bridge Theatre. Ralph Fiennes plays Robert Moses, the real-life\nurban planner whose infrastructure projects dragged\nNew York kicking and screaming into modernity\nwith parks, tunnels, and highways, and is (say it with\nme) straight line crazy (because he built his roads in\nstraight lines). On paper, this seems interesting, and\nit is. Only that it is more interesting than entertaining\nwith a predictable structure and formulaic approach\nto storytelling.\nRalph Fiennes is brash and boisterous as Moses. UnderNicholasHytner\u2019ssimplebutprecisedirectionheis\nundeniably intoxicating to watch, although his American accent is sometimes questionable. The supporting\ncast stand their ground beside him; Siobh\u00e1n Cullen\nas Finnuala Connell, Moses\u2019s long time assistant, is\ngrounded and candid in her portrayal of a woman infatuated by Moses\u2019s philosophy and sense of civic duty.\nIn the first act she, alongside Samuel Barnett\u2019s equally\nstrong Ariel Porter, clashes with Moses who plans to\nbuild roads on the privately owned Long Island, granting the growing urban population of New York access\nto the recreation areas. But this conflict is inorganic,\ncarefully designed to allow Fiennes as Moses to divulge\nhis utilitarian, and sometimes Machiavellian, world\nview. Interesting to hear, not as entertaining to watch.\nThe second act skips forward thirty years where his\nworld view has deteriorated into the delusional pipe\ndreams of a cantankerous old man blinded by corporate greed, losing sight of the communities who he supposedly serves. His plan to build a highway through\nWashington Square is met with resistance by local\nactivists. Support for their cause germinates and sympathy for Moses wilts. The seeds of the inevitable hu-bristic downfall at the end of the second act are sown\nearly on. But because his downfall is so predictable, the\nemotional force of it is nullified.\nHare toys with the nature of duty and democracy,\nbut this never sinks deeper than one of Moses\u2019s witticism laden rants. There is a question about the effectiveness of the \u201cstrong man\u201d to rise above the bureaucratic governmental administration. But Hare merely\ncontemplates the idea rather than firmly exploring it.\nThe moral ambiguity of Moses\u2019s decisions is also unex-plored. The real-life Moses was accused of racism, moving communities out of deprived areas to make way for\ntransportlinks.Again,thisisonlybrieflytouchedonas\npart of his undoing.\nStraight Line Crazy brings nothing new to the theatrical table. Yes, it is interesting to learn about biographical details of Robert Moses and urban planning,\nbut Robert Caro\u2019s 1974 biography of Robert Moses\nThe Power Broker does this far better. Probably written\nknowing that Nicholas Hytner would direct and Ralph\nFiennes would star, David Hare\u2019s 39th play risks com-placencyinatimewhentheatreisinneedofdynamism.\nUltimate urban planning?

    "content": "In March of this year, my course convener gifted his students the book The\nMinistry for The Future by Kim Stanley\nRobinson. It falls under the relatively\nnew genre of cli-fi (climate fiction \u2013 not\ntobeconfusedwithclimatechangedeni-al) and has received stellar reviews from\nnumerous prominent figures in the field.\n\u2018Itwasgettinghotter\u2019-thenovelstarts\nin the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh\nwith a grotesquely vivid, gut-wrenching\ndescription of one of its protagonists,\nFrank May, experiencing the worst heatwave in the history of humanity. Frank\nis an American man working there as an\naide but finds himself on the brink of\ndeath. In one scene which describes his\ndesperate attempt to cool down by going into a lake, Robinson writes, \u2018People\nwere dying faster than ever. There was no\ncoolness to be had. All the children were\ndead, all the old people were dead. People murmured what should have been\nscreams of grief; those who could still\nmove shoved bodies out of the lake, or\nouttowardthemiddlewheretheyfloated\nlikelogs,orsank(\u2026)Everyonewasdead\u2019.\nAs readers, we are thrown into the\ndeep end of the horrors that the climate\ncrisis could lead to. But the book goes\nbeyond that. As a result of the heatwave\ncrisis, an international organisation\ncalled \u201cThe Ministry for the Future\u201d\nis set up, charged with representing future generations in climate-related dis-cussions. Its leader, Mary Murphy, is\nanother protagonist whose narrative\nruns through the novel \u2013 and her story sheds light on the challenges of climate change politics and economics.\nIt is the interweaving patchwork of\nnarratives,includingthatofFrank,Mary,\nclimate scientists in the\nArctic, youth\na c t i v i s t s ,\neven some\nnon-living\nentities (e.g. a\nphoton) and\nother individuals being\nground down\nby climate change, that enables readers to truly imagine and, on many oc-casions, relate deeply to, the crises in\na profound way. Whilst some critics\nhave argued that the novel is too utopian or unrealistic in its conclusion \u2013\naimed to inspire hope \u2013 it is nonetheless a fascinating and worthwhile read.\nOf course, as the title of this article suggests, the deadly heatwaves\nportrayed in The Ministry for the\nFuture are no longer just fiction\nconfined to the pages of a book.\nThis past week has seen headlines\nof an actual heatwave in Northern and\nWestern India \u2013 including, as life imitates art, Uttar Pradesh - across multiple\nmedia outlets. India\u2019s weather depart-ments, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), have already\nraised alarms of expected\ntemperature rises in the\ncoming weeks. The month\nof March this year recorded the highest average temperatures in 122 years, according to the IMD. In the\ncapital of New Delhi, temperatureswillsurpass44\u00b0C.\nThe tragic reality of the\nclimate change crisis is that\nthe first ones to bear the brunt of the\nconsequences will be those in poorer\nregions \u2013 often whose lifestyles contribute relatively little to total carbon\ndioxide emissions compared to those in\ndeveloped countries. Dr Chandi Singh,\nthe senior researcher from the Indian\nInstitute for Human Settlements, said\nthat \u201cPoor people have fewer resources\nto cool down as well as fewer options\nto stay inside, away from the heat\u201d.\nAs students living in one of the most\nexpensive cities in the world, with relatively few discomforts in our day to day\nlife (at least nothing compared to that of\na deadly heatwave), it can be uncomfortably easy to be not only geographically\ndistant but also emotionally detached\nfrom such events. Perhaps this is the\ngreatest struggle in solving the climate\ncrisis \u2013 the challenge to empathise with\nthose already experiencing the conse-quences, as well as our future selves who\nwill eventually be in the same position\nif we remain on the current trajectory.\nNovels like The Ministry for the Future\noffer a way for us to use our imagination\nin ways that bring forth the empathy\nthat is crucial to fighting climate change.\nIf news headlines and statistics are not\nenough to trigger action, then perhaps it\nis time we turn to stories \u2013 both fiction\nand non-fiction \u2013 and absorb them with\nthe intent of responding through action.\nHeatwaves in India surpasses 44 \u00b0C \u2013\nfiction or reality?\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nMonami Miyamoto Environment Editor\nMARCH THIS YEAR\nRECORDED THE\nHIGHEST AVERAGE\nTEMPERATURES IN\n122 YEARS\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 6TH MAY 2022\n9\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nHahyun Lee\nEnvironment\n\n"

    "content": "Over the past few years, and especially since COP26, news outlets\nand social media have served up slews\nof unsavoury facts and statistics relating\nto the planet and its climate, with few\npositive stories among them. Unfortunately, the nature of the media is that\nnegative and sensationalist news tend\nto trump positive stories. Nonetheless,\nthere has been one recent example of\nglobal restoration efforts being success-ful. The hole in the ozone layer has begun to heal itself and is predicted to be\nfully repaired by the end of this century.\nThe ozone layer is a region of high\nozone concentration in the stratosphere\nthat absorbs a large amount of UV\nradiation (particularly harmful UV-B\nrays) before it reaches Earth. This\nprotects the Earth\u2019s surface from\nscalding, as well as shielding humans\n(and other animals) from a source of\nskin cancer.\nBy the late 20th century, parts of\nthe ozone layer had been severely\ndamaged and thinned by the continuous\nrelease of ozone-depleting chemicals\nsuch as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),\nmethyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride,\nhydrobromofluorocarbons, and more.\nThese were mainly the by-products of\naerosol sprays, coolants for household\nappliances, and agricultural practices\nsuchassoilfumigation.Ozonedepletion\noccurs by introduction of chlorine and\nbromine molecules into the atmosphere.\nThese are highly reactive and damaging\nto ozone molecules. According to the\nUS Environmental Protection Agency, a\nsinglechlorineatomcandestroymillions\nof ozone molecules when released into\nthe stratosphere.\nThe first research on ozone depletion\nwas published in 1969 and 1974, by\nDutch scientist Paul Crutzen and\nAmerican chemists Mario Molina and\nFrank Sherwood Roland respectively,\nin papers which explained how ions\nof nitrogen, chlorine, and bromine\ninteract with ozone molecules. Parts of\nCrutzen, Molina, and Rowland\u2019s work\nalso identified links between human\nactivity and these molecular reactions in\nthe atmosphere.\nThe ozone hole \u2013 the area of most\nsignificant depletion \u2013 was observed in\na later paper by Joseph Farman, Brian\nGardiner, and Jonathan ShanklinBritish scientists involved in Antarctic\nsurveying. The paper explained that one\narea of Antarctica had ozone levels that\nwere much lower than the rest of the\nozone layer. This area, which became\nknown as the Ozone Hole, was shown\nto be more depleted every year, and had\nnoticeable effects on temperatures in\nthe Southern Hemisphere, particularly\nOceania and Antarctica. This triggered\ncampaignsandprotestsallovertheworld,\nled by environmental organisations such\nas \u2018Friends of the Earth\u2019 and the 'Sierra\nClub\u2019.\nIn 1987, the Montreal Protocol was\nformed by the United Nations, and was\nratified by 198 countries around the\nworld (every member state at the time).\nThe Montreal Protocol regulates the use\nof ozone-depleting substances (CFCs in\nparticular), which forced corporations\nto find alternatives. This agreement -which significantly reduced the amount\nof ozone-depleting chemicals released in\nthe following years - was a vital step on\nthe road to the ozone layer\u2019s recovery,\nand many of its original policies are still\nbeing followed today. Its most recent\namendment, the \u2018Kigali Amendment\u2019\n(2022), regulates hydrofluorocarbon\n(HFC) emissions. While HFCs do\nnot contribute to ozone depletion,\nhence their exclusion from the original\nagreement, they are greenhouse gases,\nand so contribute to global warming and\nclimate change.\nSince the implementation of the\nMontreal Protocol, the Ozone Hole\nhas slowly but steadily started to\nrepair. Although this is a major\nwin, both for us and the\nplanet, maintenance of\nthe ozone layer relies\non the stability\nof the delicate\nr e l a t i o n s h i p s\nbetween UN\nmember states.\nSadly, the world\u2019s\ncurrent political\nclimate (what\nwith the RussoUkrainian war,\nthe effects of Brexit\n, and the continuing\npandemic) is proving to be\na significant barrier to making\nsound and successful regulatory\nagreements on climate change.\nWhile Glasgow\u2019s COP26 furthered\nthe discussion around international\nenvironmental policies, it looks like\nthere is still a way to go before we are\ncollectively on track to direct our focus\ntowards the climate crisis, let alone\nkeep global warming to 1.5 degrees\nCelsius. No individual country has or\nwill solve climate change alone, and\nEgypt\u2019s COP27 this year will be another\nopportunity for world leaders to not\nonly speak up, but to step up and make\npowerful moves like the Montreal\nProtocol.

Each item has been\nintricately designed and sculpted using thoughtful\nparaphernalia that collectively speak to a much greater\ntruth as an ensemble.\nResembling something out of a Day of the Dead cel-ebration, The Procession, a carnival of form with some\n150 statues marches the thoroughfares of Tate Britain\nmarking the whole the Duveen Galleries theirs, vehemently telling (and yelling) their story. The parade is\nnothing short of a dream sequence. With a perfectly\nbalanced tone of horror and narrative, these life size\nfigures meander through the gallery donning intricate\nmasks and costumes, telling a poignant story of pain\nand anguish with an eye to past and present events.\nWith obvious inspiration from Carnivals and the\nmany west indies cultural influences, Hew Locke has\nmanaged to pack the procession with a lot of telling\nnarratives. In the very first statue of the parade, we see\ncontemporary narratives surrounding the Ukraine crisis and Russian oil influence brought to surface with\na child carrying a drum lined with a share certificate\nissued by the Russian General Oil Corporation from\nthe 1900s. And as we progress through to the end, we\nsee the emergence of similar narratives of regressed his-tories. Sugar plantations, shares of exploitative colonial\nenterprises (the West Indian Improvement corpora-tion), caricatures donning lion medallions and battleship insignias and symbols shepherding people with\nropes! We see signets of Winston Churchill and Stalin are marked on either side of the statue whose face\nis \u2018stamped\u2019 with a colonial era commemoration coin.\nPaintings and photos of the colonial past are fashioned\nasflagsandtextilestobewornandcarriedbythesestat-ues as they wade through the very halls that house the\noriginal works.\nWhile these elements, particularly those pertinent\nto colonial history, have been common fodder of reflective exhibitions (especially over the last two years),\nwhat is different here is the subtlety and the nuance of\nthe characters sketched. There is no screaming visage of\na person in chains nor is there a glowing archetype of\na villainous western entity. Rather - the statues seek to\npresent the confusing effect and weight of the trauma\nof these histories, steering well clear of judgement.\nAs I said, the procession contains some 150 statues,\neach constructed and presented in such a detailed and\nintricate manner, and the narratives told by them are\naplenty, that to delve into each in the space of an 800-word essay is meaningless. This is not an exhibition to\nbe taken in with one sitting. But perhaps the best way\nto savour it is to criss-cross the permanent exhibition\ngalleries adoring the procession on either side and sampling it with some time to let these elements breathe.\nThe props and the dresses adorning the statues are\nall hand sewn and the statues themselves are fashioned\nout of simple materials like cardboards, papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9,\nand repurposed plastics. Interestingly, despite the enormity of the emotional anguish being conveyed through\nthese statues, we rarely see the true face of any one in\nthis procession! Consistently behind masks and beads\nwe see them largely as members whose identities have\nbeen done away with. Most of them are even dressed\nin bonds and shares, and have any individuality erased.\nThis is not to say that the procession is muted, with\nidentical caricatures walking a zombie land. The outcome is anything but that, with a large tapestry that\nechos myriad voices only spoken and presented with a\njuxtaposed tone.\nSpeaking to Elean Crippa (Senior Curator, Tate\nBritain) about the exhibition, Locke notes how he likes\nto see \u2018Time as non-linear and lingering\u2019. By returning\nto his earlier work for The Procession, he has captured\nthis feeling quite well in the exhibition. We can always\nfeel the movement in these statues, frozen in frame\nwith their passion and dynamism of action intact (that\none would see in Bernini\u2019s work).\nThere is some two hundred or more years of history depicted in this parade \u2014 spoken in simple truths.\nThehallsof TateBritainholdsomeofBritain\u2019smostfamous and cherished work \u2014 and with this temporary\nexhibition there is an addition to these quarters, of a\nwork of equal talent and vigour\u2026 trying to tell the confused stories that are oft missed in between the cracks.\nSo go one afternoon and attempt to unpack it! Wade\nthrough the parade as you would in an actual carnival,\ntaking in the fresh breath of perspective and narration\n\u2014 and walk out with a story or two to recount!\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Writer\nThe Procession\nWhere?

Many universities benefited\nfrom his generosity but Imperial was\nthe most fortunate. However, his largest bequest went to the creation of the\nBeit Trust (as it is now called), a charity\nformed \u201cFor the Benefit of the People\u201d\nof Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. The\nTrust still exists, providing funds for ed-ucation, health, and the environment\n- all sourced from investments from the\noriginal bequest. I encourage readers\nto visit their webpage to appreciate the\nwork of this wonderful organisation.\nThe Beit Trust was formed and nurtured by Sir Otto Beit in his position as\nthe first Chair of the Trust. This passed\nsuccessively to one of his sons, Sir Alfred\nLane Beit, and then to one of his grand-sons, the current Chair, Sir Alan Munro.\nIn the original History Group report,\nAppendix 9 provides a history of the association of Julius Wernher, Alfred and\nOtto Beit with Imperial, and it is well\nworth reading. They are by a long way\nthe most generous philanthropists of the\nCollege. Again, it is impossible to translate accurately what these sums mean in\ntoday\u2019s money, but my best guess is that\nthe total is equivalent to something like\n200 million pounds. In 1931 the Rector\n(i.e. President) Sir Henry Tizard wrote\n\u201cpractically the whole of the endowment\noftheCollegesinceitsincorporation[in\n1907] has been provided by Sir Julius\nWernher, Mr Alfred Beit and Sir Otto\nBeit\u201d.\nSince it is Sir Otto Beit after whom\nBeit Hall is named, I encourage students\ntoreadthesectionsabouthiminAppen-dix 9. Of particular relevance is the fact\nthat he took a special interest in the welfare of the undergraduates of Imperial,\nand because of this he funded the construction of Beit Hall and Beit Quad.\nHis list of donations to the College and\nthe details of his close involvement with\nthe running of the College, including\nhis appointment to the Governing Body\n(nowCouncil)for18years,runstothree\npages of the Appendix. In his obituary\nof Otto Beit, Tizard said \u201cHe interested himself not only in the government\nof the College, but also in the life of the\nstudents, many of whom are indebted to\nhim for unobtrusive acts of kindness.\u201d\nThe benefit of adding another name\nto that of Sir Otto Beit on Beit Hall is\nunclear to me personally. It is supposed\nto be that of an African scientist - but\ndo they have any connection with Otto\nBeit? Both names would be distracted\nby each other in joining them together.\nAnd a great African scientist connected\nto Imperial deserves their own unique\nrecognition I would think. This would\nhave much more impact.\nThe College is asking the trustees of\nthe Beit Fellowship for Scientific Research, founded by Otto Beit, to repur-pose this PhD studentship to be specifically for African students. It seems to\nme that Beit Hall embodies three very\npositive things that link together students and Africa: Sir Otto Beit\u2019s championing of, and generosity towards,\nImperial\u2019s undergraduates; the work in\nAfrica of the Beit Trust that he formed\nand directed and devoted much of his\nenergy to; and the new Beit PhD scholarship for African students (assuming it\ngoes ahead). An imaginative display in\nBeit Hall illustrating these connections\nwould cultivate interest in Africa in the\nCollege, and if the College wishes to\nfoster growing links with Africa in a serious way, Beit Hall might become a focal\npoint for this. The suggestion of naming\nit Beit Africa Hall would draw attention\nto this and celebrate it.\nhttps://forms.\noffice.com/r/\nYEUV6Jq3XC\nshorturl.\nat/ilstG\nHEY YOU!

When\nconsidering \u2018biological research\u2019, renowned\nprojects such as the Antibiotics Resistance Project\nand ground-breaking discoveries such as Watson and\nCrick\u2019s DNA model usually come to mind. While\nsuch works are undoubtedly remarkable, they represent a mere fraction of all biological research, most\nof which serves as under-appreciated bases for subsequent prize-winning findings.\n\u2018How to Walk on Water and Climb up Walls\u2019 by\nDavid Hu can both inspire biologists to appreciate the\nbroad scope of biological research, and help non-biol-ogists understand the basic stages in biological re-search, and the importance of curiosity and detail-ori-entation in this process.\nThe book acts as a magnifier, taking readers to the\nmost inconspicuous corners and overlooked aspects in\nthe world of animal motion. For example, one chapter\nexplained why the urination durations for all mam-mals, from humans to elephants, are approximately the\nsame, despite bladder volume differing by magnitudes.\nThe author\u2019s inspiration for this study derived from\na time when he was changing diapers for his son, and\nhis son decided to urinate as his diapers were being\nchanged. In counting the seconds to calm himself\ndown, Hu noticed his son urinated for approximately\nthe same amount of time as himself, while the amount\nof urine their bladders were able to hold were clearly\ndifferent. He then, with his students, decided to collect data of urination time and volume from a variety\nof mammals in the zoo, including those of dogs, pan-das, and rhinoceros. Though all other variables, such\nas time of day and diet, were different, the animals\nshowed strikingly consistent urination times. Though\nhis students were disappointed and\nlargely discouraged by the lack of\nvariation across all animals, Hu\nbelieved this was the most interesting result of all. After examining the anatomical diagrams for\nthe urinary systems of hundreds\nof mammals, Hu noted that their\nsystems\u2019 structures were remarkably consistent. Most importantly,\nthe ratio of urethra length to\ndiameter, 25:1 in males and 17:1\nin females, was conserved in not\nonly humans, from newborns to\nadults, but also across all mam-mals, from mice to elephants.\nAt the time, research on the necessity of urethras\nin mammals was unprecedented. Moreover, there was\nthe question of why urethras are so conserved while\nother aspects of the mammal body, such as thicker\nlegs for elephants, change so drastically with respect\nto changes in body size? To further investigate the\nfunction and structure of the urethra, Hu used Pascal\u2019s\nBarrel experiment, which showed that a fluid\u2019s pressure is dependent on its configuration, not the amount\ninvolved. Applying this to urethras, increased length\nutilises gravity to increase the pressure that is driving\nurination. Therefore, the length: width ratio of the\nurethra is the determining factor in mammals\u2019 urination time, rather than the amount of urine involved,\nwhich explains how the constant proportions of the\nurethra result in urination time being approximately\nthe same across all mammals.\nAlthough this was criticized as being a waste of\nscientific research, understanding mammal urination\ntime can in fact be used to preliminarily examine patients\u2019 urinary health before resorting to more expensive tests. This example also highlights the importance\nof noticing and investigating seemingly plain and\nunexciting data.\nThe remaining chapters discuss other research Hu\nwas involved in, including how water striders can walk\non water, how snakes can glide in the air, the aerodynamics of eyelashes, how dead fish\ncan \u2018swim\u2019, and how ants can create\nant \u2018rafts\u2019 to float on water. The\ncontents of this book allow readers\nto realize how seemingly basic or\npeculiar research can be used in unforeseen ways and to understand the\nboundlessness of biological studies.\nHu uses a casual tone to explain\ncomplicated concepts in a way that\nmakes it accessible to scientists and\nnon-scientists alike. In a story-telling\nmanner, Hu reveals details about his\nacademic career and the sources of\ninspiration and people with whom\nhe worked, giving his book a distinctive voice by incorporating his own humour.\nThis book not only discusses the biophysics behind\nanimal motions ranging from walking on water to\nflying in the rain, but also reveals the typical \u201cfail,\ntry again, repeat\u201d journey of biological research, and,\nmost importantly, inspires readers to \u201csee the world\na little differently, with an eye for the details, a heart\nopen to strangeness and wonder, and a commitment\nto always asking why\u201d.\nHow To Walk On Water\nand Climb Up Walls\nBook Review\nFiona Zhang Books Writer\nFRIDAY 6TH MAY 2022\n\u201c\nTHE BOOK\nHIGHLIGHTS THE\nIMPORTANCE OF\nNOTICING AND\nINVESTIGATING\nSEEMINGLY PLAIN\nAND UNEXCITING\nDATA\n\n"

For those who haven\u2019t heard of\nhim before, as I hadn\u2019t, his style has often been\ncompared to the visual comedy of Buster Keaton and\nJacques Tati. For those who haven\u2019t heard of them\nbefore, think of the trademark visual styles of Wes\nAnderson and Edgar Wright. What I\u2019m doing here\nthough, in trying to frame Suleiman\u2019s work through\na familiar Western lens, is kind of what this film is\nsatirising from the beginning. Before making his\nfirst film, he says, he\u2019d never heard of any of them.\nIt Must Be Heaven is a satirical comedy that follows\na fictionalised version of the director, playing himself,\non a quest to find a studio to produce his latest film.\nThe story begins in Nazareth, as all good stories do,\ntravellingfirsttoParisandthenontoNewYork.Mostly\nthough,thenarrative\u2013ifyoucouldcallitthat\u2013consists\nof a string of absurd and existential vignettes that the\n\u2018fictional\u2019 Suleiman silently witnesses along the way.\nThe cinematography of the film lends itself very well to\nthese vignettes, with charming colours and interesting\nframing that feels strangely comfortable. This style\nworks well with the starkly sparse dialogue, resulting\nin a cohesive film that really does show rather than tell.\nSuleiman\u2019scareerspansroughly30yearsbutcontains\nonly four feature films - although, having never made\na feature film, I hesitate to judge his work ethic. His\nwork is characterised by vignettes of Palestinian\nlife, centred \u2013 understandably - on important\nthemes of cultural and geographical identity. But\nin a funny way. As Gael Garc\u00ed\u00e1 Bernal (also playing\nhimself) phrases it to a producer in the film, \u201che\u2019s\nmaking a comedy about peace in the Middle East\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny already\u201d, says the producer.\nA Palestinian comedy seems like a bit of an\noxymoron to a Western audience. About halfway\nthrough the film, Suleiman visits a different Parisian\nproducer. The man politely explains to him how\npleased they would be to make a film about the\nPalestinian conflict and how sympathetic they are\nwith the subject, but that unfortunately they could not\nproduce his film since it wasn\u2019t \u201cPalestinian enough\u201d.\n\u201cIt takes place in Palestine, but it could take place\nanywhere - it could even take place here\u201d, he says. The\nimplication is clear that audiences expect Palestinian\nart to say only one thing, if they even expect it at all.\nDespite being very funny at times, it\u2019s a quiet and\nlonely film - and deliberately so. Suleiman is evoking\nthe alienation that he has felt as a stateless traveller all\nhis life. But in the same instance it evokes a real sense\nof community; not only that of a common cultural\nidentity, but as a foreign viewer too. Suleiman\u2019s silent\nobserver presents a ready canvas on which the viewer\ncanprojectthemselves.WhilstI\u2019msureImissedalotof\nthe nuance in the depiction of Nazareth, the segments\nin Paris and New York contain many irreverent and\nrecognisable caricatures of Western culture. Parisian\npolice whirl through the street on roller blades\n(they really do that) and measure precisely how far\na restaurant\u2019s tables extend onto the pavement, in a\nclassic display of libert\u00e9. Locals battle for possession\nof green chairs in the Jardin des Tuileries, as tanks roll\nthrough the streets on Bastille Day. Police wrestle a\nwoman in Central Park to the ground, a Palestinian\nflag painted across her bare breasts \u2013 all a sort of\nsymbolism, maybe, of Suleiman encountering the\nsame exact tension abroad as he is used to back home.\nAt times some of the metaphors can feel a little\ntired or forced \u2013 a supermarket in the US where every\nshopper and employee sports an array of automatic\nweaponry, both an obvious stereotype of American\nculture and a clear parallel to our perception of\nPalestine. Maybe that\u2019s deliberate \u2013 perhaps \u2018tired\nand forced\u2019 is exactly how Western depictions of the\nMiddle East feel, whichever side of the debate they\nhappen to be on. Another scene, when Suleiman\narrives in Paris, sees him at a caf\u00e9 staring quite\ncontentedly whilst attractive, stylish women walk\npast him in slow motion to the tune of \u2018I Put a Spell\non You\u2019 for over two straight minutes, does feel more\nthan a little weird. It\u2019s an unfortunate stumble in a\nfilm that otherwise feels very complete and polished.\nOverall, It Must Be Heaven is a film with a message,\nandit\u2019sonethatSuleimanseemstohavebeensayingfor\nhisentirecareer;that,outsideofpolitics,Palestiniansare\nindeedapeoplewitharichcultureandartisticheritage.\nIt might seem like an obvious message, but I think it\u2019s\none that still needs to be said. Elia Suleiman is an older\nman now, but he seems to be saying it still, maybe for\nthe good of the younger generation. The film ends with\nhimreturningtoNazarethandvisitingaclub,wherehe\nwatchesyoungPalestinianssinging,dancing,andliving.\nIt Must Be Heaven\nFilm Review\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nJonah Hewett Film Writer\nDirectedby: Elia Suleiman\nStarring: Elia Suleiman, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal\n\u00bb The latest feature from Palestinian director Elia Suleiman\n\n"
