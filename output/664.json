    "content": "Letters Cuts Blarney Dear Pallab\nOn reading last week's FELIX, I was very displeased\nwith the news item, entitled\nTCU Slams UGC'. The first\nthree paragraphs I suppose you\ncould call news. However the\nlast paragraph was written in\ntotally a different vain.\nHere your News Editor (J Martin Taylor) seems to have\ncompiled his own little editorial\nso for those people who have\nread this section, I would\nlike to put the matter straight.\n; Where J Martin says 'it is\nwidely believed that the Union's\" comments will not be taken too\nseriously,' does he not\nmean\u2014that he does not believe,\nas he was the only person who\nread and was therefore able to\ncomment on the report.\nHe then concluded by saying\n'in the opinion of a number of\npeople who have read her\nreport'. That is a number of\npeople, meaning one person\u2014\nhimself.\nI will therefore ask your\nNews Editor to refrain from\ndeliberate exaggeration and to\nput only news into news\narticles, not his own personal\nopinion, and, then claim that it\nwas also the opinion of many\nothers.\nYours sincerely\nSean Davis\nIC Union Hon Sec\nPS: How wide is J Martin\nTaylor?\nA Happy Man Dear Gaynor\nAt last I am a happy man.\nWords can scarcely express the\nI delight that 1 felt on finding that\nthe baked beans in the Union\n\u2022 Refectory were at last hot on\nMonday.\nEach fork-full of the perfectly\nformed beans (in a steaming hot\ntomato sauce) cleaved to my\npalate rendering me speechless\nwith delight.\nMay IC join NUS, may the\ni Union move to Southside, may\nthe tiles fall off Elec Eng, may\nthe Bot/Zoo tea room close\ntomorrow; but please, oh please\nmay the baked beans never be\ncold again.\ni; Ah, what a wonderful thing it\ns is to have one's whims catered\nto by so great a caterer as Mr Mooney.

WIST\nSurvey\nDear Pallab\nA group of women at College\nare carrying out research for a paper to be presented at the\n1984 SR HE( Society for\nResearch into Higher Education) conference. The\npaper will be concerned with\nwomen presently studying for a science and engineering degree,\nand women who decided to\nleave college mid-course. We\nhave had a good response to the\nquestionnaire sent out before\nChristmas, and would like to\nask all those women who have\nnot yet completed their\nquestionnaires to please do so\nas soon as possible. This will\nenable us to compile a paper\nincluding all of the wide ranging\nviews of women in College\u2014the\nproject being especially\nimportant since 1984 is\n'Women into Science and\nEngineering' (WISE) year, and\nthe various committees are\ninvolved are very eager to see\nresearch on this subject\npublished in their effort to\nencourage more women to take\nup scientific/ engineering subjects at all levels.\nThanks for passing the\nmessage on.\nYours\nSusan Watts\nThe Grumpy Guy Dear Sir\nYou recently telephoned me\nfor information about our Common Room in the Beit Quadrangle. I gave it to you but did so\nreluctantly in light of your\ndistorted reporting of earlier\nrelated events.\nIn future if you want information from me about the Department will you please ask for it in\nwriting. I shall then do my best to\noblige you if your request is\nreasonable. I shall do so in\nwriting and as quickly as circumstances permit.\nProfessor RK S Wood\nDep Rep\nElections\nDear Pallab\nYou mentioned in your\neditorial last week, the hack\nelections. However you om mitte d to mention the\nimpending dep rep elections\n(papers up Tues 24).\nIt is time for ordinary\nstudents in the College to wake\nup and realise what is\nhappening around them.\nEducation cuts mean that\nchanges will have to be made.\nUnless students know what is\ngoing on, then they will suffer.\nThe job of a dep rep should\nnot be taken on by a final year\nstudent who suddenly finds\nhim/herself with nothing on\nhis/her CV. Neither should it be\nused just as a step towards hack\n(or CCU) heir arch y. Dep Reps need to care for\ntheir students, their depart-ment, their Union and their\nCollege. A good Dep Rep does\nnot have a quiet life.\nDedicated people, your\nstudents need you.\nYours\nG Thorpe\nMet & Mat Sci Dep Rep\nEditorial\nControl\nDear Pallab\nAs a supplement to the typing\ncourse on which you were\napparently sent (the upshot of\nwhich I shall refrain from\nmaking comment on here!),\nmay I suggest that you attend a course in the art of text editing;\nan art in which\u2014judging by the\nway you pejoratively and\nclumsily edited a letter of mine\n(printed in the FELIX of 20\nJanuary)\u2014your abilities as\nFELIX Editor appear somewhat dubious and\nincompetent!\nI refer of course to the way in\nwhich you unc e remo niu o sly cut\nshort the letter half way\nthrough a paragraph, without\nPhilip A Green\nFly the\nFlag I Dear Pallab\nThis letter is one of many I hope to be sending over the next\nfew weeks to inform people\ninside and outside College of\nour Union selling porn.\nI remember the feeling of\nfrustration and anger I felt at\nthe beginning of my first year\nwhen I wrote a highly\nemotional letter to FELIX and\na number of outside organisations complaining about\npornography in our College.\nChris Crownshaw criticised me\nthen for washing 'dirty linen' in\npublic. Over a year has past, we\nhave had four opportunities to\nwash that 'dirty linen' yet as a result of the Mines' campaign\nand our own apathy we have\nnot done so. The pornographic\nevents continue.\nThere are many ignorant\npeople in this College, there are\nmany who do not care to think\nabout reality and choose to live\nin their private little worlds\naway from nuclear weapons,\ndegradation, poverty, in humanity and war. Their\nattitude towards the pornographic industry in this College\nis a symptom. R SMU in its\nactions at UG Ms and elsewhere\nhas staunchly defended\nprejudice, ignorance and\nnai vit y. The 'Save Mines\nCampaign' was one to defend\nthem if from anything from the\nreal world, the world of\nsuffering that they wish to\nforget and wash their hands of.\nThe letters and the motion at\nthe U GM are not an attempt to\nwash our 'dirty linen' in public.\nI believe it is up to us to choose\nwhat kind of Union we have,\nbut once we have chosen, and\nthe opportunity has been given\nto us three times this year, then\nwe must be willing to show\npeople what we are like. We\nshould all be proud of our\nCollege and Union. Chris\nCrownshaw should be proud of\nthe R SMU and therefore only\ntoo pleased that I am telling\npeople about it. I hope all of\nyou reading this are proud of\nour College, I hope you will\nthank me for spreading its good\nname, indeed your good name.\nAnd if you are not ask\nyourselves why?\nI am not washing our \"dirty\nlinen' in public I am simply\nflying our Union's flag.\nYours sincerely\nMichael Newman\nPage 2 Friday, January 27, 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Arthur Michael, the good but not very helpful\nfairy, was all in a tizzy. 'Does my hair look\nalright, Nigel?' he asked earnestly. 'And what\nabout my tie\u2014is it straight?' Unfortunately\nfor Arthur, his minion had long since left the\nroom bored with Arthur's perpetual ques-t ions. But what was the reason for Arthur's vain concern? Was he going to another of\nLady Marigold's garden parties? No, it was\nnothing less than an edict from the top floor\nof the Surefield Building that was the reason.\nArthur Michael was going to see The Baron\nand his sidekick, John Secretary. Glancing at\nthe time, Arthur realised that his make-up\nwould have to be left unfinished so, grabbing\nhis wand, he hurriedly left his office and made\nhis way to Surefield.\nThe top of the Surefield Building was just\nhow he remembered it from his previous\nvisits. The rows of offices whose occupants\nhad so little to do. They were all political\nappointees who owed their position to the\nBaron's patronage and favour. Furtively\npeeping around one office door, he gazed\nupon its splendor o us decorations, the lavish\nfurniture and fittings. Its occupant sat at a large desk reading a newspaper.\n'I 'll soon have one that big' thought Arthur\njealously comparing it with his own paltry\noffice tucked away on the outskirts of the\nkingdom. Turning around, he stared at the\nlarge double doors that confronted him\u2014the\nentrance to the Baron's Throne Room.\nArthur gulped, pulled his trousers around his\nample girth and tapped nervously on the\ndoor.\n'I wonder if I ought to make a special kind\nof knock and shake hands in an odd way,'\nthought Arthur who was not fully acquainted\nwith the unusual habits of his seniors.\nHowever, there were no such requirements\nin this case. 'Enter,' cried a distant, familiar\nvoice. Arthur pushed open the heavy door\nwith all his might; it revealed a long, narrow\nchamber. At one end, seated and upon a By\nJuvenal\nraised platform, was the Baron with, as ever,\nhis loyal acolyte John Secretary. As Arthur\ntip-toed towards the two of them, John\nSecretary shook the Baron's shoulder to\nrouse him.\n'He's here to discuss FALIX,' he whispered\nin his ear. FALIX was the citizen's newspaper\nand its editor, Phallas Goolies, had upset the\nBaron and his many cronies. Arthur fell on\nhis knees and waited to be addressed. 'Who\nwill rid my Kingdom of this turbulent priest?'\ncried the Baron frantically waving his arms in\nthe air, as if brandishing a sword. Arthur\nfrowned, worried by the outburst. The odd\nlibel case was more what he had in mind by\nway of retribution, nothing more. John\nSecretary was also unimpressed by his\nsenior's brief ramble into the literary world. 'I, er we-thought of printing another edition of\nFAIRY. That is what we are here to discuss,'\nhe reminded the Baron.\nFAIRY was a newspaper produced by\nArthur\u2014hence its title\u2014and some of the\nBaron's employees with time on their hands.\n'Ah 'yes,' replied the Baron rather\ngrumpily. 'Yes, your last effort was rather\ngood...'\n'Did you read it?!' exclaimed Arthur,\nflattered by such exalted praise, and\naudaciously interrupting the Rector.\n'Do you think that I have time to read every\ntawdry rag that gets produced in my\nkingdom?' shouted the Baron who was not at\nall pleased. 'Mr Secretary explained that it\nsaid all the right things I want said and that's all that matters. So stop asking questions and\nget off and dt> as you're told!'\nFAIRY was also occupying the thoughts of\nanother of Cheapskate notables: Gormless\nLayon, President of the Citizens Association.\n'It's much better than FALIX,' she thought\nas she sat at her desk knitting.\n'It didn't have a bad word to say about me!\nAnd it criticised Goolies\u2014it's just the sort of\nnewspaper the Union really needs. I could\neven edit myself\u2014well get Pristine to do it,\nanyway.'\nGormless leaned back in her chair and\ntook a long sip of her glass of sherry and\nbegan to think. And she was not long into her\nflights of fancy when she heard cackling from\nthe room next to hers.\n'I know, I 'll get.Pristine to make a magic\nspell! I'm sure that she'll be able to get rid of\nGoolies\u2014she's helped get rid of other\ncitizen's representatives!'\nGormless opened the door that adjoined\nher room to Pristine's. There, leaning over a boiling cauldron, was Pristine, the wicked\nWitch of Southside. She was shovelling large\nquantities of paper into the steaming pot.\n'Bloody estimates,' she moaned stirring\nthe mixture with the handle of one of her old\nbroomsticks.\n'Pristine, I 've had this wonderful idea,'\nexclaimed Gormless. Pristine wearily raised\nher head knowing that any idea meant more\nwork for her. 'It's about Phallas Goolies, I thought that....'\nFELIX I BEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS i6. The Rector The man you only see twice in your life-once\nat the reception in your first year and once\nwhen you graduate after your final year.\nThus speaks the 'average IC student'. It\nseems timely, then, to look at the career of\nthis shadowy figure, the 'hunter of fascists'.\nBrian Hilton Flowers became, just over\nfour years ago, almost a family name. For it\nwas then that a devastating blow was dealt\nto London's medical schools with the\npublication of the controversial 'Flowers\nReport'. But his career began many years\nbefore this, in Manchester.\nIt was at the University of Manchester\nthat Brian was made Professor of Theoretical\nPhysics in 1958. But the key to his character\nwas his long term association with socialist\npolitics, some would say under the influence\nof Harold Wilson.\nIt came as no surprise, then, when he\ndefected from Academia to the SERC as its\nChairman. In one swift move, he had\nachieved a powerful position in the scientific\ncommunity. By this time he had met and\nmarried Mary. The circumstances of their\nmarriage are very odd.\nIn 1974, without much trouble, he came\nback to Academia as Rector of Imperial\nCollege. He professed his disenchantment\nwith socialism and expressed a desire to live\na totally academic life. Since his elevation to\nthe peerage, however, he has frequently\nspoken in the House of Lords when other\ncommitments have allowed him.\nHe was now in the position to launch his\nmaster plan. The medical schools had lost\ntheir image of youth and vitality following\nthe great post-war change. Together with\nSantos-Dyer, the mafia-boss from Cambridge (as has recently been shown) he\nexecuted the blow in his Dulles Report. But\nwhat else could be expected of a contemporary of Kim Philby?\nThe Mole\nFriday, January 27, 1984 \\ Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "3 . STRETCHING YOUR STUDENT GRANT Leg:ation concerning housing benefits was revised last\nyear, and students can now claim\nrebates from the rent and rates\nthey pay both in term time and\nduring the Christmas and Easter\nvacations instead of supplementary benefit. The undergraduate grant currently\nprovides you with an income of\n\u00a359.29 per week during term\ntime, of which \u00a319.45 is paid to\ncover accommodation costs.\nDuring the Christmas/Easter\nvacations the grant drops in value\nto \u00a324.55 per week, with no\nprovision for accommodation\ncharges. In theory, therefore, you\nshould be able to claim some kind\nof rebate if you spend more than\nthe term time allowance on\nhousing or if you pay rent over\nthe vacation. Postgraduate\ngrants are paid on a52 week\nbasis, and unfortunately they\ncannot claim back vacation rents.\nThere are now two systems of\nrent and rates rebate.\nCertified Housing Benefit\nFew students are likely to be\neligible for certified housing\nbenefit, as payment is authorised\nby the DHSS to refund the\nhousing costs of those receiving\nsupplementary benefit. If you are\nclaiming supplementary unemployment benefit and you\nneed to claim housing benefit you\nshould tell the unemployment/\nsupplementary benefit office\ndealing with your claims. You\nwill eventually receive forms to\nbe returned to your local housing\nauthority, who are the body\nwhich deals with this part of your\napplication. If they are satisfied\nthat you are eligible, they will pay\nyou your entitlement. If you can\nget certified housing benefit it is\nwell worth having, as it can\nprovide a100% rebate of your\nhousing costs, as treated by Town\nHalls.\nStandard Housing Benefit\nYou do not have to be claiming\nsupplementary benefit to receive\nstandard housing benefit, and\nstudents can therefore apply for\nit. Students in private rented\naccommodation or College flats\nmay get a rebate of anything\nbetween about \u00a31 and \u00a33 per\nweek or more, although students\nliving in Halls of Residence are\nunlikely to get much money back\ndue to the way their Hall bill\nbreaks down.\nDetails of the housing benefits scheme have been extensively covered by student services last term. Hopefully most of you are aware of your entitlements and are already claiming them. This week Peter Burt goes over the main points and attempts to clear up any confusion there may still be. How to apply for standard\nhousing benefit\nYou will need to fill in the\nrelevant form which can be\ncollected from your Town Hall\n(or Student Services if you live\nlocally). This should be filled in\nand returned to your Housing\nAuthority as soon as possible, as\nyou will only be paid from the\ndate they receive your application. They will require\nevidence of your financial and\nresidential status, so you will\nneed to show them your\nNotification of Award, most\nrecent bank statement, building\nsociety savings books, etc and\neither your rent book or a letter\nfrom your landlord (Student\nServices if you live in College\nrun for both term time and\nvacation periods. Your boro gh may ask you to reapply over the\nvacation even if they do not, you\nshould write to then: at the end of\nterm reminding them that your\nincome from your grant has\ndropped to \u00a324.55 per week\nduring the holiday period and\nasking them to reassess your\nclaim.\nYou will probably have a long\nwait before you actually get any\nmoney, so it may pay you to keep\nin touch with your housing\nbenefit office. It is generally best\nto communicate with them via\npost to be sure that the\nappropriate staff actually deal\nwith your problem.\nSupplementary Benefit and\nUnemployment Benefit\nStudents are entitled to these\nbenefits during term time as they\nare usually dependent on the\nclaimant's availability for work.\nHowever, a few students may be\nshould be further processed for\npossible entitlement to\nSupplementary Benefit. Supplementary Benefit is paid on\nthe ba is s of low income and\navailability for work, and if you\nreceive a grant you will be very\nunlikely to qualify for\nsupplementary benefit during the\nacademic year. However, LEA grants only cover 38 weeks of the\nyear excluding the summer\nvacation, so if you do not have a holiday job but are nevertheless\navailable for work you should\napply for supplementary benefit\nover the summer.\nHow to claim Supplementary and Unemployment\nBenefit.\nOn the first week day of the\nvacation go down to your local\nunemployment benefit office\n(address in phone book) and sign\non. You will need to know .your\nNational Insurance number and\nmay require proof of identity.\nBe prepared to hang around\nfor a long time! You should be\ngiven an attendance card, a copy\nof form Bl and other forms\nappertaining to your status as a student. These should be\ncompleted and returned. You\nmay also be asked to attend an\ninterview, to which you should\ntake details of rent paid/financial\nsituation etc.\nYou will probably have to sign\non on a weekly or fortnightly\nbasis at your local office to\nconfirm that you are still\nproperty). You will also need\nproof of the dates of your terms\nat College, and the address of the\nnearest post office at which you\ncan cash your giro-cheques\nif/when they arrive.\nYou can claim Standard\nHousing Benefit both in term\ntime and over the vacation.\nHowever, when you submit your\nclaim you should make very clear\nthat you wish your application to\neligible for unemployment\nbenefit during the vacations. If\nyou have paid Class 1 National\nInsurance contributions on\nearnings of \u00a31350 in the 1981/2\ntax year or of \u00a31475 in the 1982/3\ntax year when you can apply, and\nshould receive \u00a327.05 benefit per\nweek. You may also be entitled to\nhousing benefit.\nIf you are not eligible for\nunemployment benefit your case\navailable for work.\nYou should note that when an\nunmarried couple live together as\nhusband and wife, they are\nconsidered as married by the\nDHSS. Unless you can prove that\nyou live totally independently,\nthe woman will be treated as a dependent of the man, with the\nnext r sul t that the man has to\nclaim for the woman and the\ncouple receive less benefit.\nFELIXl Friday, January 27, 19841 Page 5\n\n"

Date for this cultural evening is\nyet to be fixed by our Ents committee.\nAll for now\u2014happy banging!\nPage t2H HH HH H Hm In response to questions asked, I feel 1 must\nexplain that all reports written concerning\ntable tennis in FELIX are usually one week\nout of date. This is due to the fact that\nmatches are played mid-week and so it is\nimpossible to submit reports for the week's matches before the deadline of 5:00pm Monday. Thus any references to days are to\nthe week preceding the week for the FELIX\nissue.\nLast Monday (16 Jan), Team 1 restarted\ntheir season with the promised positive\nattitude (to avoid relegation). They beat\nSainsbury are up with the leading group of\nDivision 2.\nTeam 3 continued on their way to a good\noverall performance for the season by\nvanquishing City University 9-0 (partly due\nto two-thirds of the opposing team missing\nthe match).\nTeam 4 slacked a little in their second half\nseason rally by losing 9-0 in their second\nmatch. However Brian Norminton showed\ncontinued improvement so the match was not\na total loss.\nTeam 5 played (I think) but, no report was\nforthcoming, unfortunately, as they stood a good chance of beating City of London\nPolice. No doubt the report will be submitted\nto me in time for the next FELIX issue!\nMens 1 vR HC Won 9-0\nThis was the game that no one wants to play\nin, as it means travelling all the way to Egham\nto play a team incapable of beating anyone in\nthe whole club.\nTheir court resembles a shoe box from the\noutside, but the inside feels more like an\nigloo.\nThe highlights of the match were few and\nfar between, in fact, come to think of it, tli cie were r't any. Ian ana myself managed to do\nthe impossible and lose a set to their third\npair, but we rectified things by beating their\nfirst pair 15-0, 15-7, though still not playing\nwell. Dominic Demento and Ave Allen do\ndamned war dances together and I can see\nthat Dom will have a difficult task holding on\nto the title of 'Club Nutter\". Steve and Lee\nshould really have played left-handed, in fact\nwe all should.\nMens 3 were fated by me last week and\nsomehow managed to lose 8-1 to Chelsea of\nall people. They'll still win the league though.\nThe Ladies couldn't get a team together for\nthe first time this year, but could still do well\nin the leg aue. More names for the Dublin tour please,\nleaving 10 Feb, coming back on Sunday. I really need names by today, if possible, as I need to give an indication of numbers and\nexpenses to Exec.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 I Friday. January 27, 1984 B HM St Georges Hospital 1-2 IC2\n'It's a great weight off my shoulders.' So\nproclaimed centre forward Leroy Wint j after netting his first goal of the season as IC\nSeconds continued their recent run of good\nresults with a21 win at Cobham. The result is\nremarkable when set against the outcome of\nthe previous encounter between these two\nsides when IC Seconds went down 5-0. Fielding for the first time this season an unchanged\nside IC had the better of goalless first half.\nCaptain and left-back Tony Wilkinson incurred an early injury but this had little discernible impact on the game. Midway\nthrough the second half St Georges broke\nthrough and took an ill-deserved lead.\nUndeterred IC rallied well and Leroy\nheaded in a spectacular equalise r following\ngood work on the right wing by Tom Dutton\nand Dave Lynne. The latter it was who scored\nthe winner from an acute angle as St Georges\ndrifted out of the match. The result left the\nside jubilant having taken seven points out of\nthe last eight, following a shaky beginning to\nthe session. Recent editorial trends debar\nteam lists so rather than single out any\nindividual for special praise it suffices to\ncommend the team in anonymity.\nAfter being unbeaten for two years in the\nUL U Challenge Cup IC were unable to show\nvery much live football on Saturday due to a technical dispute amongst the players. IC\nshop steward Gary Lawrence blamed the dispute on unfavourable playing conditions\nsuch as 'the opposition keep beating us', 'too .\nmany long balls for not enough reward', etc.\nThere were several unofficial stoppages\nand lightening strikes during the first half\nhour during which the Goldsmiths black legs crossed our picket-line three times, without\nmuch resistance, despite chants of'Out! Out!'\nand 'Offside, ref!' from our members. After\nconsultation with an AC AS official dressed in\na black suit, IC members voted for a return to\nwork for twenty minutes either side of the tea\nbreak. During this period productivity was\ngood and IC were well recompensed by a header from flying picket Dave Griffiths, and\na fine shot on the turn from striker John\nRigby.

He had hoped for a quick Publications Board meeting on Monday evening (so he\ncould race up to the West End\nand drool over Natassia Kinski in\nher latest film) and a longish\nUnion General Meeting to provide the usual quota of funnies\nfor his customary amusing (?-Ed)\nsketch.\nHowever it was not to be. Pub\nBoard lasted over two hours\u2014\nprimarily due to STOIC being\nrepresented by the two biggest\ntits in College\u2014and the U GM for\na mere three minutes (that's right\u2014180 seconds) because the\nthird biggest tit in College called\nquorum when the meeting\nrefused to let him have his way.\nHe had wanted the clearly\ngi quo rate meeting to discuss the\nmotions first as he feared someone would call quorum if the\norder of business was not\nchanged to hear the officers\nreports after the motions. He was\ndefeated and called quorum\nhimself; meaning that, by\nanyone's logic, he was afraid of\nhimself, which suggests he\ndeserves our sympathy rather\nthan our contempt. Tough luck\nsucker, and I know not who they\nare, you're getting no sympathy\nhere.\nThe meeting then continued\ninformally with a general discussion which proved reasonably\nfruitful, but not enough to\novercome the basic problem of\nwriting 650 words on three\nminutes. This has been done\nbefore; actually someone once\nwrote a book called The First\nThree Minutes, but he was\nsubsequently awarded the Nobel\nPrize for Physics and this\nphysicist is of slightly lower\ncalibre.

The launder et te, in the basement of Southside, is part of phase\n1 of a scheme for the complete conversion of the area into student\nfacilities. In addition phase 1 includes a gym and changing facilities\nwhich are also under construction. The preparation of a weights training\nroom in the Southside basement has also recently been completed.\nWork began on 7 November Halls.\nlast year and the completion date\nis 5 March. However the contract\nis running 2 to 3 weeks behind\nschedule, according to Mr John\nLauwerys, College Senior Assistant Secretary. It is hoped that\nthe time can be made up to enable\nwork to finish not more than a week behind schedule.\nThe launder et te will have ten\nautomatic washing machines and\nfour tumble dryers, and will be\nsituated in the former women's toilets opposite the entrance to\nthe refectory in the basement.\nThere will not be any ironing\nfacilities however. It is envisaged\nthat laundries in the individual\nSouthside Halls will be converted\nto much needed extra kitchens,\nbut that present ironing/drying\nrooms will remain unchanged.\nThere will be no ironing facilities\nfor students not resident in the\nThe gym, primarily intended\nfor martial arts, etc, rather than\nball games, is to be formed from\npart of the old refectory room on\nthe ground floor (above the\npresent refectory). Eventually it\nis envisaged that other facilities\nhere will include a squash court\nand table tennis room with men's and women's changing rooms\nand a sauna.\nThe final stages of the\nconversion plan are still some\nway in the future, but they\ninclude a concert hall, billiards\nroom, and Union offices, as well\nas the sports facilities mentioned\nearlier. The provision of such\nfacilities, duplicating those\nalready in existence, will release\nparts of the Union Building for\nother uses. Quite what other uses\nthe College has in mind are still\nunclear.\nSTOP PRESS! Anti-porn campaigner Michael Newman has taken his crusade outside\nCollege, it was revealed this week. Mr Newman has written to 17\nnational newspapers giving details of events organised by R SMU such\nas Hon Pornographers' Night and Mines Revue.\nAlready he has been interviewed by a reporter from the News ofthe\nWorld and yesterday afternoon at 3:00pm the Sunday Express\ncontacted him to arrange an interview. It is not yet known whether\neither paper will actually publish the story.\nBoth papers were attempting to contact R SMU officials yesterday,\nbut apparently without success. However, FELIX contacted Mines\nVice President Tim Williams for his reaction. He expressed\namusement at Mr Newman's antics and was not worried about\nRSMU's activities being sensational is ed in the gutter press. Mines\nUnion's position was, he believed, entirely defensible.\nCollege Secretary John Smith was not aware of the developments\nwhen FELIX contacted him at 5:00pm yesterday. He commented that\nanyone who read the News of the World was 'halfway to reading\npornography anyway'.

Without wishing to lessen the personal\nambition of rur rent IC players they are urged\nto consid f ae future and the reputation of,\nwhat is a ii er all, their own college football\nclub, be of re making similar moves.\nCongratulations to the first team on being 8\npoints clear at the top of the Universities of\nLondon League\u2014that makes us the best\nstudent team in London.\nOther teams have not fared so well,\nparticularly the third and fourth teams who\nwere both demoted to the fifth league for this\nsession. We're j still looking for some keen\nplayers\u2014it's not too late to join us!\nComing up this term are two knock-out\ntournaments: one open to non-club members\nplayed to SRA rules, the other a handicap\ncompetition with American scoring. There\nare going to be one or two afternoons in mid-February devoted to getting through the early\nrounds: these should be social occasions too\nso I expect to see most members participating! Finally, but importantly, is the clubs\nproposed tour of Southern Ireland. Dates\nhave now been aired for 30 March to 8 April.\nWe will be driving around the country\u2014\nsubject to the transport committee letting us\nhire one of the College minibuses\u2014playing\nboth university and club sides: our final\nmatch should be a memorable one in Dublin\nagainst Guinness Breweries.\nMy thanks to Dr Oliver Dolby (Biochem)\nfor all the organisation he has done so far to\nget the tour on the road. I don't think we're\ngoing to be short of numbers for this, so if\nyou're keen, you had better sign up rapidly!\nRemember that last year's tour to Germany\nincluded two people who had never played a competitive match before, but they had great\nfun.\nGood squashing!\nWay out on the Western Spiral arm of the\ngalaxy, near a small yellow star, orbit ted at a distance of roughly 93 million miles, by an\ninsignificant blue-green planet, there is a small hole in the space-time con in tu um. To\nplug this void, occur ing at 6:30-8:70 on\nTuesdays and Thursdays, in the Union Gym,\nthe inscrutable monoliths of 208 Hamlet\nGardnes occasionally employ a tiny imperceptible device known as the IC Judo Club.\nTheir ability to do this effectively is slightly\nhindered by those members whose attendance has fallen off lately. However seven of\nus resent ly helped London at Brunei's inter-university competition (attended by the likes\nof Bristol, Brunei, Cambridge and Norwich).\nFEL Km W kw m kw mm kW kW kW k^k wm The men's A team smashed all of the\nopposition into, the mat, taking gold for the\nsecond year running. The men'sB team\nnarrowly missed the semi-finals, and the\nwomen's team, comprised entirely of IC\nregulars, took bronze in their event. Thanks\ngo to Mark, Tim, Graham, Andy, Rachel,\nAnna and Gabi.\nIC have a friendly contest with London\nHospital on 31 January, which promises to be\na very good practise for beginners and higher\ngrades alike. The annual inter-collegiate\ncompetition is looming, and we get to keep\nthe trophy if we win it again, so a strong\nturnout from all, please. There is a grading on\n4 March, and everyone, especially lower\ngrades, are capable of doing well.\nWell, here at last is the first ICH GC report of\nthe year. Last Saturday saw four IC fliers\nbrave the bitter cold at Dunstable (200ft; wind light, W/ NW with scratchy lift). Our\nPresident, Dave Rusby, took to the air first on\nthe Vortex and managed a good soaring flight\nin marginal conditions. However, on top-landing, the bushes claimed yet another\nvictim and it was a good forty minutes before\nthe wing de flex or was temporarily repaired.\nDave Thorns was next to lob-off and, after\nmuch pedalling for his stirrup, was forced\ndown. Mel took advantage of the mild\nconditions to convert from seated to Budgie\n(with no problems whatsoever) and, after\nmuch gentle persuasion, Dave. Evans\nmanaged to get signed off for his three high\nflights. All in all a fair days flying marred only\nby Dave Rusby's clutch slipping on his *\n\u2022\nPassion Wagon Sunday's flying was nonexistent due to the North wind and\nrain\u2014preventing Pete from converting to\nBudgie on his Scorpion.\nDon't forget meetings Mondays at 12:30\nabove Southside Bar or see you on the hill.\n2nd XIv Goan 3-0\nAfter the draw last week in a friendly against\nChalfont, the seconds got down to the serious\nbusiness of avoiding relegation to the second\ndivision of the Middlesex League. At nearly\nfull strength the side soon mastered the skills\nof the opposition to dominate the first half\nwith better control, crisp interceptions and\nimaginative passing, but were unable to\nbreakdown a solid defence, though Roessink\nwas unlucky on two occasions the surface\npreventing better chances. Meanwhile Goan\ndid not look like scoring with goalkeeper\nSlatter only touching the ball once in the half\nand Dodds breaking down any threatening\nattacks on their right wing.\nThe half-time talk brought more urgency\ninto IC's play and in a series of well-taken\nshot-corners Whitehead came close to\nscoring on several occasions. Finally with\nabout ten minutes left, frustration boiled over\nWWWWFriday, January 27, 1984J kW kW k in a series of wild tackles from both sides\nwhich affected the opposition more than us.\nIndeed one of their players intent on revenge\nagainst a tackle allowed the ball to reach the\nright wing, where Eldridge cut inside and\nfrom a tight angle beat the goalkeeper at the\nnear post.\nWith the required breakthrough IC now\nlooked a different side and in the next few\nminutes created several chances for Whitten\nand Whitehead, though Gean also had its\nbest chance of the game, a first time shot from\ntheir left-wing. Finally the game was decided\nwhen another attack was stopped just outside\ntheir circle and from the resulting free hit,\nRoessink hit a first time shot past a stationary\nkeeper. The opposition were now totally\nde moral is ed and with minutes to go, Eldridge\npicked up a cross from Holgate at the top of\nthe circle and rounded the keeper for his\nsecond and IC's third goal of the game.\nInter-University Gliding Club Task Week\nThis year's Task Week was organised by\nImperial College Gliding Club and held in\nearly August at our local airfield at Lasham\nnear Basingstoke. Teams from the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Essex,\nSouthampton,- Surrey, and, of course,\nImperial completed over a number of set \u2022\ntasks which typically consisted of a triangular\ncourse, total distance around 120km, with\ntwo distant turning points (distinct landmarks such as a radio mast or a power\nstation) which have to be photographed as\nproof of ones progress. A complicated\nscoring system which handicaps the average\nspeed around the task (or the distance flown if\nthe task is not completed) is used to award\npoints.\nOur luck/skill varied considerably during\nthe week from the day when all three I CGC single-seat sailplanes landed in the same\nfarmer's field some fifteen miles form the\nairfield, to an impressively quick 120km flight\nby Ann Dziwior in the usually docile K8.\nOn the while, however the week was\nextremely successful with five competition\ndays, and all nine participating IC pilots\ngaining excellent soaring and cross country\nexperience either flying solo, or with an ex- .\nstudent or friend of the club in one of the\nthree borrowed two-seat gliders. Despite\nsupplying the computer program which\ncalculated the scores, Imperial finished third,\nwith honours going to Cambridge and\nSurrey.\nFollowing the tradition of holding the Task\nWeek at the same venue for two consecutive\nyears, Imperial is again to host the\ncompetition at Lasham in 1984 before it\nmoves on, probably to Edinburgh. Hopefully, with similar weather and field conditions, a little more luck with the thermals, and\nthe benefit of more intensive instruction\nthrough our weekend training courses which\nstarted this e yar, we could see I CGC moving\na littler nearer the elusive first place.\nWkWH^m mW km W kW mm Wm OBtBBU Page\n\n"

All submissions made in this way are\nconsidered by the committee,\nwhich consists of student and\nstaff reps along with Mr Victor\nMooney, Refectory Manager.\nHowever the boxes, which arc\neasily mistaken for lar j/c nesting\nboxes, have in recent years lost\ntheir labelling and the convenient\npaper and pencil which used to be\nprovided.

So\nFELIX issues an appeal to all\nrefectory customers\u2014start corn-plain ing now and let's see the\nsuggestions boxes filled to\ncapacity!\nMooney Tops\nOn Prices\nA questionnaire has been sent out\nby Union Internal Services\nChairman Hugh Southey to\nother colleges around the country\nto find out how their refectories\nare managed. The sample was\nchosen to give colleges with a mixture of student union and\ncollege run refectories with some\noutlets run by outside contractors.\nReplies to the questionnaire\nare now being returned and are to\nbe used by the Union in\nsuggesting to the College\nimprovements in the running of\nrefectories, or even as a basis for\nthe Union managing its own\noutlet. Early replies suggest that\nwhilst IC's refectories are some of\nthe worst in terms of food\nquality, Mr Mooney's financial\nperformance is rather better than\nmost from the College's point of\nview, in that he is able to make a slight overall profit.\nThe reply from the Bedford\nCollege Union President, Miss\nDelyth Morgan, was less than\nhelpful, however. She returned\nthe questionnaire, refusing to\ncomplete it because the covering\nletter from Mr Southey began\n'Dear Sir'.\nNo Star Wars In an entertaining lecture given to\nWellsoc members on Monday,\nProfessor Geoff New of the\nphysics department convinced\nhis audience that laser and\nparticle weapons in space are\nimpractical as a solution to the\narms race. Even if it were possible\nto build a suitable laser, simple\ncalculations show that to satisfy\nits fuel requirements would take a space shuttle trip per day for\nmany years. A single battle\nstation in a geostationary orbit\nwould not be effective because of\nbeam divergence, and therefore\nabout 150 stations in lower orbits\nwould be required. The system\ncould never be tested before use,\nand even an unlikely 95% success\nrate in shooting down missiles\nwould still allow hundreds to get\nthrough. Countermeasures are\nvery cheap and easy to think of.\nThe deployment of laser weapons would in itself be a very\nprovocative and des tabi lising act.\nSuperpower interest in 'space-wars' research is driven not only\nby military aspirations but by\neconomic, political and prestige\nconsiderations, according to Professor New.\nBar Promotions Piss Up! ICU Deputy President, Christine\nTeller, has succeeded in persuading the Bar Committee to hold a one week bar promotion. From\n26 February to 3 March most\nbeers in College bars will have\ntheir prices cut to 50p. The only\nexceptions to this will be\nGuinness, which will be sold at\n60p, and the Guest Ales, which\nwill remain at normal prices.\nAlthough Bar Committee is\nstill to final is e details, it is\nplanned that in addition to the\ncheap beer other special events\nwill be organised. This may\ninclude free food and free enter-tain ment. The only thing that seems\nunlikely to be changed is the price\nof spirits. This is because reducing the price of beer is seen as\nthe most effective way of boosting bar trade.\nNormally this period of the\nyear is a particularly poor one for\nbars. This is because spring term\ngrants are beginning to run out\nand academic work is beginning\nto build up. However this week is\nlikely to be one of the busiest ever\nas it coincides with Carnival, ICU and C CU elections and several\nother major events.\nFlash in the Pan\nA chip pan fire has left a flat in\nthe College's Lexham Gardens\nhead tenancy with an unus u able kitchen. The fire, on Tuesday\nevening, started when a resident\nof the flat put the chip pan on the\ncooker and forgot about it.\nReturning later to the kitchen he\nfound the room full of dense\nblack smoke and burning oil all\nover the cooker.\nThe fire brigade were called\nand soon four fire engines were\non the scene.\nThe fire was quickly extinguished, leaving the residents to clear up the smoke-blackened room. There is considerable damage to the cooker and\nother electrics, and the walls and\ncontents of the kitchen were\ncompletely coated with a black\nresidue.\nThe residents later enjoyed\ntheir meal which had been\ncooking in the oven, without\nchips.\nWhen asked if the food was\nwell done they said it was still a little undercooked. One resident\nwas reported to have said 'It's salads for us from now'.\nOBITUARY\nIt is with regret that the Union\nlearned of the death on\n10 January of Miss Phyllis\nTrimmer, Manageress of the\nUnion Refectory for several\nyears.\nICU has given a donation to\nFriends of St Thomas Hospital\nin lieu of flowers in accordance\nwith Miss Trimmer's wishes.\n\\Friday, January 27, 19841 \u2022Page 3\ni "

    "content": "Sudden Impact (Warner West End)\nClint Eastwood is back as Dirty Harry, a 'street-tough homicide detective'. The plot\nconcerns the revenge killings by a girl of the\nmen who gang-raped her and her sister ten\nyears before, the shock having reduced the\nsister to a vegetable. Rarely have 1 seen so\nmany gratuitous shootings and killings in a film\u2014you wonder whether there will be any\none left alive in San Francisco at the end of\nthe film. The morals are as primitive as the\ndialogue, condoning 'an eye for an eye'\npseudo-philosophies whilst yelling 'go kiss\nyour ass, you go damned mother fucker!'. As\na film, however, Sudden Impact is well\nphotographed and moves along crisply. It is a professional Hollywood film. If you like guns,\nviolence and a stronger plot than is usual in\nsuch films, Sudden Impact is just great.\nVassa (Academy Cinema) is a Russian film\nexamining the family of a powerful shipping\nmagnate in the 1913 Ukraine. Vassa is a Lady\nMacbeth figure who will stop at nothing to\nensure the survival of her husband's business. Various people oppose her, and\nthe plot follows the successes and failures in\nVassa's ambition as Russia slides inexorably\ntowards the First World War and revolution.\nThe whole thing has the ring of a 'classic'\nabout it, like adaptations of serious novels\nlike Tess or The French Lieutenant's \u2022 Woman. The acting is immaculate and the\nphotography concentrates hard and long on\neach scene. It is all rather heavy going, but\nVassa cannot be faulted as a period film with\na quality and scope perfect for wallowing in.\nThe Second Awakening of Christa\nKlages (Hampstead Everyman) is a title to\nput anyone off. The implausible plot\nconcerns the aftermath of a bank robbery by\nChrista & Co who intend to use the money to\nsave a children's commune. Everything goes\nwrong with Christa's plans, and unfortunately with the film. The twisting and\nturnings of the plot soon muddle the whole\nargument of solidarity between women.\nSeveral interesting characters are introduced but are not developed properly before\nChrisfa dashes away to have her next crisis.\nChrista herself is uncompromising and\nwitty, and until she started daubing feminist\nslogans on walls, I thought she was a realistic\nand intelligently played character. Because\nits clich es are muddled The Second\nAwakening leaves you nothing but irritated\nand confused.\nCarry Greenham Home (same pro-gram me) is a documentary about the\nGreenham Common peace camp. There are\nsome excellent 'behind the scenes' episodes\nespecially when you see what Francis\nCoverdale of the BBC is really like. There are\nno interviews or commentary so in concentrating on the set piece confrontations with\nthe police (often admittedly very funny and\nhighly effective on film) the film doesn't give\nDirty Harry and Christa Kluges both doing what they do best.\na full enough picture of what life at the camp\nis like. The camera remains a mere recorder,\nlike aTV news programme, and so the film as\na whole seems superficial, because it does\nnot concentrate on particular characters.\nThe best episode of all was a woman talking\nabout her reasons for having her baby\nactually in the peace camp. The film is worth\nseeing, if you are willing to sit through The\nSecond Awakening.\nDream Flights (Gate Bloomsbury) is a delightful light comedy about a charming\nnon-com for mist. He is used to behaving like\nan irresponsible adolescent, but suddenly as\nhis 40th birthday looms nearer he finds\npeople are not willing to indulge his fantasies.\nThankfully there's no complex psychological\nanalysis\u2014the man is attractive yet self-centred, and the film humorously explores\nthe dangers and delights of such behaviour.\nWell worth seeing.\nThe Honorary Consul (Classic, Haymarket) is sadly a mere excuse to show off\nRichard Gere's 'delectable bum'. The book is\none of Graham Greene's better works, but\nby making the film a vehicle for Gere the\ndirector concentrates too much on the\ncentral triangular relationship between a doctor (Gere), a beautiful local girl and her\nhusband, a drunken British consul. The\nconsul is played by Michael Caine who\nprovides the major spark of life to a film that,\ndespite some rave reviews, I found a major\ndisappointment.\nTony Atkins\nBrainstorm (ABC, Empire)\nStarring Natalie Wood and Christopher\nWalken.\nScientists have invented a helmet capable of\nrecording feelings and emotions, which can\ntransfer these experiences from one mind to\nanother. Initially the helmet is used to\nfrivolously record thrills of sport and sex\nuntil someone dies while recording. The\n'death tape' is immediately locked away by\nthe authorities. The plot centres on one of\nthe device's creators, Christopher Walken,\ntrying to get the tape so that he can play it\nthrough to the end.\nA fascinating idea, carried out extremely\nwell. The 'helmet' sequences are shot in\nCinemascope with extra speakers for the\nsoundtrack in larger cinemas. The effects\nare spectacular, with a breathtaking final\nsequence that leaves audiences stunned.\nMoon in the Gutter (Lumiere)\nStarring Nastassia Kinski (sigh!) and\nGerard Depardieu.\nThis French language film comes from\nthe makers of Diva and can be likened to a magazine cover-glossy and slick on the\noutside and totally empty on the inside. The\nfilm, made almost entirely in the studio, is\nbeautifully shot, and the e the rial Nastassia\nKinski is at her brilliant best. The film,\nhowever, is let down by a very poor plot,\nwhich makes an otherwise masterful work\ndrag rather.\nPallab Ghosh\nPage 81 1 Friday, January 27, 1984 \\ FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial College Radio is now better than ever before. Adjustments to the transmitter have improved coverage and sound quality on broadcasts to Southside and L instead. Three new turntables provide a professional stand dard of record reproduction. And enthusiasm both at the station and with the listeners is so high that broadcasts goon until one in the morning and all day Sunday. Why don't other London colleges have radio stations like ours? Read on. IC Radio\nand the Pirates\nAnyone hoping to set up a radio station must\ncomply with Home Office regulations. The\nHome Office rules for college stations confine\nthem to transmitting on medium wave and\nforbid them to broadcast over campus boundaries. This is easy to do in the case of a campus university. A cable takes the signal\nfrom the transmitter to the aerial, which is in\nthe centre of the campus. The signal strength\nis adjusted so that there is negligible reception\nat the boundary. And that's it.\nIn the case of an urban radio station, it's not\nso easy.\nIC Radio must not be picked up in the\nMews or Exhibition Road. In order to be able\nto broadcast at all, a 'leaky feeder' system was\nset up in Southside and Linstead. A qualitative explanation of this is quite simple.\nAll signal-carrying cables radiate. In the\ncase of a cable supplying an aerial for a campus, the power required is 3 watts and\nthe signal from the aerial swamps that from\nthe cable. For the IC Radio 'leaky feeder'\nsystem, the power is turned up to 2 0 W, but\nthere are no aerials. Instead, the cables are\narranged vertically, two in Southside and one in L instead, each the height off the\nbuilding. The IC Radio broadcasts come from these cables. Matched resistors on the\nends of the cables stop the signals from\ngoing any farther. The ferro concrete structures of Southside and L instead actually help to confine the signal to the\nbuildings, aiding reception inside and preventing broadcasts to the Mews residents.\nIf you have a portable 'tr an ny' tuned to\n301m MW and you are standing under the\narch in Southside near the entrance to the\nrefectory, you can pick up IC Radio, but if\nyou walk just a few yards towards the Mews, the signal disappears completely.\nIt is interesting to note the effect that\nRadio Caroline has had on student radio.\nWhen IC Radio was set up, Radio Caroline\n1\nwas broadcasting from a boat in the Thames. These broadcasts were relatively\nweak, but because of Caroline's proximity to\nImperial, IC Radio were forced to change\ntheir frequency to 301m MW. The Radio\nCaroline boat then sank, but because of the\ntrouble it had caused, many Universities were allowed to set up their own legal\ncampus stations, and they were all given the\nold Radio Caroline frequency.\nNow Caroline has been set up again, using\nthe same frequency and again on a pirate\nbasis, working from a boat. However, this\ntime they are using a power full OkW transmitter which can reach parts of Europe\nand has completely drowned out all the\nuniversity transmitters which use the same\nfrequency. Radio Caroline's only comment is\nthat Caroline produces the sort of music\nthat students like, and so in their view\ncampus radio stations are no longer required.\nThis is a lamentable attitude, as stations\nsuch as IC Radio not only provide local news\nand information, but provide students interested in radio with an opportunity to\ngain expertise in the field.\nFeature About\nIC Radio\nThe idea that IC should have its j own campus radio started in mid ,\nJanuary 1974. The problem was to\nfirst persuade the Union and then\nCollege to spend \u00a31,500 to set the ,\nstation up. The IC Campus Radio\nSociety was formed in order to\ncampaign for the setting up of the\nstation.\nIC Radio were not allowed by\nthe Home Office to use the\ninduction loop aerial system\nemployed at most other student\nstations. The problem was that IC\nis in the centre of London and\nsignals would be able to be picked\nup off campus. In 1976 IC Radio\nadopted a 'leaky feeder' aerial\nsystem which complied with Homer\nOffice regulations. By December\nthat year, College allocated a further \u00a31,500 towards the setting ]\nup costs of the IC Radio studios\nand the installation of new lines.\nThis meant that they could\nbroadcast live from their studios |\nwhich had previously not been\npossible. On the second of\nDecember, 1978, medium wave\nbroadcasts began.\nIC Radio is run as a club with\nannual membership 50p. It is under .\nno obligation to comply with the\nviews of the Union in any way\u2014it\nhas unlimited journalistic freedom.\nThis sets it apart from other college\nstations which are mere organs of ;\ntheir unions, and have to toe the\nline or have their grants cut.\nTo be trained as aDJ for IC\nRadio get in touch with IC Radio\nStation Manager, Neil Collins or any\nIC Radio member on internal 3440.\nWhere to\nListen\nIn Southside and L instead tune\nin to 9 9 9 KHz,301 m MW. Experiment with the position of your\nradio\u2014it might work better near\nthe radiator. There are also speakers in L instead Bar and Falmouth-Keogh.\nIn Evelyn Gardens speakers are\nsupplied by a rented post office\nline.\nIn the J CR except when STOIC are broadcasting.\nIn the FELIX Office on Thursday nights, while you are collating,\njust before you get your free drink.\nRequests are gratefully received\non internal 3440 and are usually\nplayed within half an hour.\nFELIX II Friday, January 27, 19841 I Page 7\n\n"
