Eng.) supporting the\nstudents' views, and the idea was eventually defeated.\nThe Rector put forward a note giving the students' views,\nasking for a year's experimental representation on the GoB,\nF&E, and the BoSt. He also suggested the idea of excluding\nthe student observers from certain areas of discussion.\nProfessor Chain (Biochem) spoke strongly against representation, saying it was not in the best interests of the\nCollege and nothing of interest to students was discussed at\nthe BoSt. which could not be dealt with by existing\nmachinery.\nThe Union proposal was not, he claimed, based upon a desire for staff/student dialogue, but on pressure from political activists. It was a misconception and distortion to\naccept representation because of democracy and because\ntheir demands were moderate.\nThere could never be equality between ' masters and disciples '. Student unrest was a political manifestation; appeasement never paid, and IC had a duty to show leadership\nin the situation.\nChain was supported by Professors Sparkes (Civil Eng.)\nand Wood (Botany).\nProfessor Butler then spoke in favour Lord Penney's proposals. He would not be unhappy if student representation on the BoSt. was made permanent. This would help\nbreak down the separation of the Academic and Student\nbodies, and, he was sure, in time would build up an atmosphere of collaboration with students.\nRejections\nRejection of the proposals would provoke controversy,\nwhich it was very desirable to avoid.\nHowever, he agreed with the ideas of reserved areas of\ndiscussion.\nThen followed several shorter speeches. Professors Jones\n(Maths), Ford (Mech Eng.), Hewer (Zoo) and Barrer (Chem.),\nUbbelohde (Chem. Eng.), Francis (Civil Eng), Anderson\n(Elec. Eng.), Hall (History of Sci. and Tech.) and Richardson (Metall.) all spoke against student representation on the\nBoard. Most of these were concerned that the presence of\nstudents might inhibit free discussion at the Board. It might\nbe better to invite student representatives for discussion of\nspecific issues. It was, in general, better to leave student\nrepresentation to the BoG.\nProf. Ball (Metall.) thought IC would be performing a great national service if the Board rejected the students'\nproposals, despite the risk of precipitating unrest.\nProf. Butler spoke again in support of the Rector's note.\nNotwithstanding his very warm support for staff/student\ncollaboration at grass roots level, he still felt that student\ncontributions on the Board of Studies would be valuable\nin areas which cut across Dept. boundaries.\nAfter a few minor speeches, a vote was taken, and the\nidea of having student observers on the Board was defeated\nby 17 votes to 8.\nNo Hanging\nat I.C. On Tuesday, 11th November, I.C Debates held one of\nits all too rare meetings to\ndiscuss the motion, ' This\nHouse would reinstate capital\npunishment'.\nThe motion was proposed\nby Coun. Lazarus, sent by\nConservative Central Office,\nbut speaking, he said, from\na purely personal viewpoint,\nCoun. Lazarus said that in\nrecent years two elements had\ngained prominence in the\nspectrum of crime\u2014firstly\nthere was a growing tendency\nto make the life of the criminal more comfortable in\nprison; and secondly crime of\nall sorts was on the increase.\nThe proposer claimed that\nthese two could be equated,\nand so one way of reducing\ncrime was to reduce the comfort of the criminal. In the\ncase of murder, he continued,\nhanging was the one real\ndeterrent, and he concluded\nby saying that although one\ncan't reform a murderer by\nhanging him, doing so might\ndeter others.\nMiss Penny Tomlinson, opposing the motion, stated that\nthe finality of death was very\ndifficult for man to accept\nand it was for this that murder was thought of as the\nworst crime, and so should\ncarry the supreme penalty.\nWith the use of statistics,\nshe showed that since the\ntemporary abolition of the\ndeath penalty the incidence\nof murder had remained\nabout the same. Murder, Miss\nTomlinson submitted, was\ncommitted under intense\nmental and emotional stress\nirrespective of the penalties;\nthis is readily seen in the\ncases of family murders. Thus\nthe argument that hanging is\na deterrent does not hold\nunder close examination.\nMiss Tomlinson, it must be\nsaid, was using the results of\nan intensive survey on major\ncrime on which she had been\nworking.\nMr. Cullen, seconding the\nmotion, deplored the increase\nin crimes of violence since\nthe abolition. Les Ebdon,\nseconding Miss Tomlinson,\nclaimed that there was no\ndeterrent to a crime which is\nlargely a manifestation of in-sanity, although perhaps tem-por ary, in extremely emotional circumstances.\nAfter some lively speeches\nfrom the floor and summing-up speeches from the principal speakers, the motion was\nput to the vote and defeated\nby 100 votes to 17 with three\nabstentions.\nUNION MEETING\nNOV. 20\n1 p.m. MECH ENG.\n220\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT\nCommunity Action\nRefectories and Food\nDIVERSIFICATION\nAND\nREPRESENTATION\n(i) Report on BOST (Nov\n12) meeting.\n(ii) Report on JURGO\n(Nov 17) meeting.\n(iii) Public Statement when\nQueen comes.\n(iv) Statement to F.&E.( Nov. 21).\n(v) South Africa and Hall\nfees.\n(vi) Sabbatical Year for\nPresident.\n(vii) Use of space under\nmotorways.\nDoes your club require\ncheap, reliable transport?\nIf so, the R.C.

Felix appeared in some guise or other on\nevery FELIX since the\npaper's conception, and disappeared only when FELIX\nchanged printers early this\nyear. Famous throughout the\nBBC as the cat the Radio\nTimes pinched to use as a heading for their children's adventure weekly, his temporary disappearance was\nmourned by all. Many Happy\nReturns.\nBill's Booze\nAt Linda Steer's recent\nICWA Sherry Party, W. Penney divulged to our editor\none of his lesser known experiences during the Second\nWorld War. He was engaged\nin research in a US warship\n\u2014research which involved\nthe use of alcohol. American\nNavy ships being \" dry\",\nevery evening a queue of\nthirst-ridden sailors would\nform outside Bill's laboratory\nall hoping for a drop of the\nhard stuff.\nLinda Steer\nWhen asked if he thought\nhe would be in his present\nposition if his benevolence\nhad been discovered, W. Penney replied in the negative,\nadding that he would probably still be in jail.\nSecrets?\nAs an irrelevancy, our\nMexican correspondent tells\nus that the Mexican secret\npolice\u2014a much larger force\nthan the British equivalent\u2014\nbought 2,000 Datsuns from\nJapan this year. Apparently\nthese are the first Datsuns in\nMexico. Your guess is as\ngood as ours as to how many\nsecret police there are in\nMexico, but estimates range\nup to 2,000 less than last\nyear.\nMore Commem\nFurther to the funny tale\nbefore, yet another example\nour Uncle Bill being all heart.\nRecognising that most of the\nstudents at IC couldn't give\na Mooney chip for Commemoration Day, our spies inform\nus that he is willing to do\naway with the whole affair if\nstudent opinion is against it.\nCrunch. Not exactly student\nopinion but students' mums'\nopinions\u2014'cos, says Uncle,\nthe Ms and Ds revel in this\nkind of thing ! Watch out for\na coming FELIX with a questionnaire for you to send\nto your mum\u2014and . . . .\nTalking about questionnaires : Felicity's amazing\nreferendum on whether or not\nIC needs a newspaper drew\na staggering 100 per cent\n\" yes \". No Stalinist rigging\nthis. But out of modesty we\nmust asked if 4 \" yes ses\" is\nstatistically significant in a college of 3,900. Anyone who\ncan provide a lucid mathematical proof of significance\nwill receive his next FELIX\nfor free.\nN.U.S., What it's All About\nNow that we have joined N.U.S. what can we get out\nof it. Anyone expecting a box of good things to be dumped\non the doorstep of the union will be disappointed. Returns\ndon't come in the same way as for instance when we buy\na glider. With a few important exceptions we get what\nN.U.S. gives already without paying for it. N.U.S. is a national pressure group for students and will go on without\nus. However if every other college did the same there would\nbe no National Union and no national student pressure\ngroup. I.C. for many years has been regarded as isolationist\nby other student bodies. People at I.C. have regarded\nthemselves as different from other students and able to do\nwithout any official contact with other unions. This is a view\nhowever which has been recently changing and the attitude\nof students here has changed tremendously in the last two or\nthree years.\nN.U.S. has also reformed itself. It has become more efficient\nand has started to take a determined stand on student\ndemands. In the past N.U.S. has thought of itself as a mediator in any dispute between students and authorities in\ncolleges. Now it is much more forthright in its support for\nlegitimate student causes. In this respect it could be of use\nto I.C. If anything blows up, for instance in the deadlock\non double discipline, Jack Straw has said that he would\ncertainly come (if asked) to talk to the Rector and admin.\nAt Guildford School of Art N.U.S. blew the issue of staff\nsacking up to national proportions and Guildford School\nhas now been black listed by the staff unions. The Select\nCommittee report on Student Relations has now agreed with\nthe N.U.S. recommendations and has also called for an\nindependent inquiry there.\nN.U.S. of course has always run a travel agency and I.C. students have used it in large numbers. In fact last year\nAlbert Preston, Treasurer of N.U.S.. said that N.U.S. would\nlose money if I.C. joined N.U.S. because individual members\npay \u00a32 as opposed to 5/- a head for affiliated colleges and\nover | of I.C. students were members. N.U.S. also run\nthings like drama festivals and debating competitions. I.C. has entered the drama festival this session on a special agree-ment. If we had not joined N.U.S. we would not have been\nable to enter next session.\nThe financial arrange mnet s for I.C. joining N.U.S. are\nrather complex. The D.E.S. say that the affiliation fees for\nN.U.S. are ' legitimate expenditure' and Anthony Crosland,\nwhen he came to I.C. in 1967, said that this meant that the\nL.E. As. would certainly pay it. However the chances of\ngetting it this year are uncertain. After talking to a member\nof the admin, it appears feasible to ask the Governing Body\nfor \u00a36-5 instead of \u00a36 a head this year. A third possibility\nis that N.U.S. may waive the fees this year providing we\npay them next year. Piers Corbyn is looking into this pro b lem. In any case the External Affairs Committee will probably decide to send two observers to the Margate conference\nwhich starts on Nov. 24th. Going back to the Select Committee Report all national\neducational bodies except N.U.S. are criticised.. The A.U.T., the A.T. T.I.,N. U.T., and the committee of Vice-Chancellors\nare all criticised for lack of organisation and zest. About\nthe N.U.S. they say, ' They seem to be succeeding in creating\na truly national body to protect and advance what they see\nas their legitimate claims. They have enabled student concerns to be well defined despite the complexity of the\n(educational) system !\nI.C. has finally moved out of its isolationism. Let us hope\nthat we can help N.U.S. meet the challenge in pressing for\ngreat changes in the educational system of this country.\nEdgar Broughton at I.C. hop last Saturday.\nPublished by The Editor, City of London Polytechnic Newspaper, and Printed by F.

    "content": "Page 2 FELIX 20th November, 1969\nON FUSION A TO UNC IL The addition of the department reps to ICU\nCouncil further increased the the size, squabbling,\nand cumbersome unmanageable nature of the\nsecond Council meeting this year, held in the old\nAstro-mooney on Monday, 10th November.\nThe meeting was notable for a large amount of\nconfusion. This was largely due to poor chairmanship by Messrs. Corbyn and Guy, the latter of\nwhom took the chair so many times that he was\naccused of acting as a co-chairman! Both of these\nhad, at times, difficulty in controlling the meeting.\nDisagreement frequently flared up between Guy\nand Corbyn, or one of these and the floor, sometimes resulting in quite sharp exchanges and many\n\"oh, shut up you\" type incidents.\nThe matters dealt with were, with 3 or 4 important exceptions, rather trivial, and if it were not for a lot of general\ntime-wasting, some of which could have been prevented by\nthe chairman, the conclave need not have dragged on past\n11.30 p.m. As it was, the tired and impatient members of\nCouncil were finally able to dash off to bed at 01.08 a.m., Tuesday.\nNevertheless, it was noticeable that, while some people\nwere unhappy about Corbyn's handling of things, none of\nthem hesitated to lumber the President with any jobs that\ncame up during the session!\nGLIDER\nOne of the major items that came up was the matter of\nthe Gliding Club's appeal to the College Centenary Appeal\nFund for \u00a3500 to replace their Eagle sail plane. This glider\nbelongs to the College, but maintenance costs are paid by the\nUnion. The club therefore thought it reasonable to ask the\nCollege, and not the Union, to replace it. This would in fact\nsave the Union some of the heavy repair cois ts. Council made no concrete move on the matter, but will\nnot allow the application by the gliding club until the possibility of obtaining money from this fund has been advertised\nto all clubs and societies.\nThe Fund will also be asked for money towards the IC\nLodgings Bureau. Council, meanwhile, gave \u00a370 to put out\nmore circulars to landlords.\nSUPPRESSION\nThe Pro-Rector came under heavy fire for apparently\nattempting to censor the views of the Union representatives\nchosen by Piers to meet the UGC Arts Committee, by objecting to the Union submitting some documents giving Union\npolicy on diversification of courses. In general, it appears\nthat the College is attempting to push the Union around too\nmuch for the liking of many Council members.\nIt was decided to consider petitioning the Queen to have\nthe Royal Charter of the College changed to allow student\nparticipation, when she comes to open College Block, and/or\nto hand out pamphlets on this occasion.\nA boycott of refectories was also mooted, as a protest\nLyon Playfair Underused The Lyon Playfair Library has now settled down\nin its new site in the Library Block, with the\nbuilders only remaining in parts of the basement.\nThe book collection, has been tremendously ex-p and ed, though still leaving over 70% of the space\nempty to allow for the envisaged expansion. The\nnumber of spaces for students to study has been\nincreased to 500, from 80 in the old building, and\nthe library now stays open until 9.30 in the even-ing, and is open until 5.30 on Saturday.\nThere are also carrels and study rooms in which\nacademic staff and post graduates can work in\npeace.\nAlthough borrowing of books has increased, the\nreading and study areas are very little used.\nSince the Lyon Playfair library now works in even closer\ncollaboration with the neighbouring Science Museum library,\nwhich is very strong in periodicals, the Lyon Playfair has\ndecided to concentrate on buildings up its collection of textbooks and advanced monographs, so that the libraries will\ncomplement each other.\nThe present stock of books is about 80,000 volumes; capacity of the new 53,000 sq. ft. premises is about 300,000\nvolumes. This year the library has been given an extra grant\nof \u00a312,000 for more textbooks and advanced monographs,\nin addition to its normal annual grant of \u00a315,000,\nThe library occupies five levels of the library block. On\nthree of these, 2, 3 and 4 are working places for 500 people.\nThese may be used during normal library hours, which are\n9.30 to 9.30 on Monday to Friday, and 9.30 to 5.30 on Saturday. The full library service is available during these hours.\nCarrels\nAlso on levels 2, 3 and 4 are the carrels. These are 65\nsmall study rooms with a desk and bookshelf, intended for\npostgraduates. They are allocated for the whole year, and\nPG's may keep their own books and library books in them.\nPlenty of these are still available, and prospective users\nshould see the Assistant Librarian in charge of Reader Services, Miss Millier. If demand is large, however, preference\nwill be given to PG's not in Hall.\nAlso on two levels are the 16 study rooms, which can hold\nup to six if necessary, and are allocated in a similar manner\nto the carrels. These are primarily intended for visiting staff\nmembers and advanced research students, though some will\nbe made available for discussion groups.\nTextbooks\nThe Library's general text-books section is on Level 2. The\nbooks are arranged according to the Universal Decimal\nClassification \u2014 the same textbook coding system used by\nthe Science Museum and other major libraries. The assistant\non the issue counter will be pleased to help you find the section you want.\nEndless line of filing cabinets\nAlso on this level is the \"Restricted Loans\" section. Here\nare kept the textbooks on the departmental reading lists.\nEvery member of the academic staff has been asked to recommend books for this section. They are kept behind a special\ncounter, and may be borrowed for no more than three hours,\nor overnight.\nPeriodicals\nLevel 3 houses the extensive Periodicals section of the\nlibrary. On the west side of the level are the bound volumes\nof past years' issues of most periodicals; the current issues\nare kept on the shelves in the east room. If the library has\nnot got the periodical you require, it will be able to get a copy from either the Science Museum Library, University\nof London Library or the National Lending Library. Sometimes, certain volumes of periodicals are removed for binding.\nIn this case, the library generally ensures that the same issues\nare available elsewhere in the College.\nOn level 4, where the reading and study spaces are very\nlittle used at present, there are report material, foreign\nlanguage journals, and the Operational Research Society\nlibrary. Also on this level is a large empty room, for future\nexpansion.\nReference\nBack down on Level 1, the main entrance level, are all the\ncatalogues, and the main issue and return counters. The\nbookshelves here accommodate many indexes, abstracts, en-cyclopaedia s, atlases, dictionaries, telephone directories, and\nother general reference works.\nOn the right of the entrance as you walk in is a small carpeted area \u2014 this is the only place in the library where\nsmoking is permitted. If, while working on a higher level,\nyou feel the need for a break and a cigarette, then please go\ndown to Level 1. There will soon be a display case in this\narea, to house recent acquisitions.\nTo get to higher floors from Level 1, go left inside the\nentrance and up the stairs on the left, past the returns desk.\nContinued on Page 5\nagainst the reluctance of the Refectory Committee to do\nanything about the students' complaints. Messrs. Stephenson\nand Seaford were mentioned as being particularly obstructive\non this and other committees.\nUNFAIR\nCo-Chairmen\nGeoff Needham brought up the disturbing and undemocratic activities of UL U Societies Council. This has some\nrather odd and apparently unfair practices, but when the\nIC delegates queried some of these, the Council got very\nstrop py and tried to shut them up! Geoff sent in some proposed amendments to its constitution, by recorded delivery,\nbefore the closing date for inclusion on the agenda, but these\nitems were not included for discussion. Now the Council is\ngoing to exclude semi-permanently all those Colleges who do\nnot send delegates to the next meeting !\nAPPEAL\nA Mr. Edwards came along to appeal against a10/ fine\nimposed on him for parking opposite Southside, without a sticker. He said he saw the business as a matter of principle\n\u2014 who is in charge of parking and discipline in these areas?\nMuch discussion followed, in which it was stated that Mr.\nEdwards was a persistent offender. At the start of the term,\nhe had gone to the Union office, and, on hearing he had not\nbeen allocated a sticker as he only came from Evelyn Gardens, he had stated that he intended to park there anyway !\nEventually his appeal was dismissed, after 35 minutes wasted.\nOther minor matters brought up at Council were :\u2014\nDave Wield has resigned from the Refectory Committee,\nand Piers Corbyn was elected in his place.\nMr. Mooney has reprimanded the barman for after-hours\ndrinking.\nThe College will be asked to up the pay scale of the Union\nClerk, Janet Hughes, as it was felt she was being overworked.\nIt was decided that clubs, etc., must duplicate their minutes\nthemselves, and not ask Janet to do it.\nEnts were given permission to end some Hops at mig night. The financial report on the proposed nursery in the basement of 8 Princes Gardens, indicates that the cost will be\n\u00a34 5s. per child per week.\nThe IC tribal warfare film is still not completed.\nTen student reps, were elected to JURGO ; these are\nMessrs. Corbyn, Guy, Hains, Hughes, Woods, Ebdon, MacAdam, Elphick, Wield, Simpson.\nThe new ICU Constitution, as worked out last year, will\nbe presented to the Union soon.\nThe President refused to buy all Council members a curry\nif the meeting did not close at 11.40. In fact, when it did\nclose just after one in the morning, most members were too\ntired even to think of food !\n\n"

Al though 6\u20140 down to 2\nKing's penalties in the first\n10 minutes, IC fought back\nwell to overwhelm their opponents with superior forward play. The pack played\nmagnificently, especially in\nthe loose, where \" fresher \"\nBrille-Edwards shone. Tries\nwere scored by John Kelly,\nBob Atkins, George Widelski and John Ballard who\nalso kicked two conversions. UC 6 pts.; IC 15 pts.\nOld rivals UC were conclusively beaten on Wednesday 5th, in a rather nig gly brand of match at Shenley.\nIf IC had concentrated more\non playing good constructive rugby instead of engaging in points-wasting fisticuffs the score line would\ncertainly have read differ-ent ly. Two good individual\ntries by Terry Stephenson\nand a superb drop goal by\nnew fly-half Alan Roberts\nproved the only really bright\nspots of the match. A try\nby Roy Anderson and a penalty by John Ballard\nmade up the rest of the IC\nscore.\nLondon Irish 2nd XV\n11 pts.; IC 17 pts.\nThis match, played on\nSaturday, November 8th, proved a tremendous win\nfor IC against a very strong\nclub side\u2014indeed the home\nback division included\nMooney, the Irish international winger! Playing against the wind in the first\nhalf, IC were unlucky to be\n8 pts. down at the interval\nafter pressing strongly. However, due to a concentrated\nteam effort, tries by Roy\nAnderson, John Gardner\nand Andy Clark plus two\nglorious 40 yard penalty\ndrop-goals by Terry Stephens\u2014who also kicked a conversion\u2014saw IC safely\nthrough to what must be\ntheir best win of the season\nto date.\nMike Adams\nSwimming\nIC vs. London Hospitals\nIn their first fixture of\nthe season, the Water-Polo\nclub played the very strong\ncombined London Hospitals\nside. The Hospitals, with 5\nUC first team players, did\nnot at first have much co he sion, and IC were able to\npenetrate the mid-bath gaps\nto make several serious\nattacks leading to the first\ngoal.\nThe Hospitals did not\nmake much headway in the\nset-piece attacks, e.g. from\nfree throws but soon discovered their ability to make\nfast, telling counter attacks.\nThese were due to the inexperience of the College\nside, both players in covering whenever their backs\nwere committed to an\nattack. In this way the Hospitals built up a6 \u20143 lead\nby the third quarter. In the\nlast quarter the college changed its tactics by leaving one\nexperienced back to break\nup the counter-attacks and\nlimiting the attack to two\nplayers. In the much less\ncongested space the IC forwards scored four quick\ngoals to make the score 7\u2014\n7 with 20 seconds to go.\nOnly a last second goal by\nUH gave them victory. All in all this was a very good\ndisplay by an untried college team against by far the\nstrongest opposition that\nwill be met this season.\nIC vs. City University\nIn a fixture against City\nUniversity, IC completely\ndominated the swimming\nwinning all the men's and\nwomen's events. With the\ntop competitive freestyle\nbackstroke and breast stroke\nswimmers in UL U the IC\nswimming team should be\nimpossible to live with this\nseason. In the following polo\nmatch an essentially IC second team was in difficulty\nagainst a physically quite\nstrong City side. The inclusion of two first team players in the last quarter gave\nIC 5 goals to level the score\nat 8\u20148.\nANDREW? photographic\n13 THE ARCADE\nS. KEN STATION\nSpecial concessions\nfor students for\nphotographic materials\nand equipment\nOver the past fortnight\nthe club has not enjoyed\nmuch success, and this has\nbeen due in the main to\nplaying Club sides who although not technically\nsuperior to I.C. have more\nexperience and have the\nadded advantage of superior\nteamwork gained from several years of playing to-get her. However, this temporary\nlack of victories is not the\nmost worrying problem\nconcerning the club at the\nmoment. Our main problem\nis apathy\u2014already we have\nbeen forced to cancel the\n5th XI due to a lack of\nplayers, and it seems that\nthe 4th XI is now in\njeopardy. Besides the unpleasant present aspect of\nthis there is a far more\nserious underlying problem\nwhich is not fully understood by most of the mem-be rs. Anyone who joins a club when he is not at col-leg e, does so because he\nwishes to play hockey on\na regular basis, and he is\ntherefore not a little concerned when he cannot play\nbecause the opposition cannot raise a team. Although\nthe fixtures for the next\nyear have already been ar-ranged, I feel that in subsequent years we will lose\nmany of these fixtures\nbecause we are not able to\nrun regular lower sevens. It\nis therefore vital that we\npull ourselves together and\nestablish regular lower\nteams, which would then\nbecome strong both on and\noff the field.\nFencing\nOn Wednesday evening,\nthe fencing club made their\nway intrepidly out to E7,\nfor the first official fixture\nof the season. A London\nLeague match against Newham fencing club.\nThe ladies team, although\nfencing below their normal\nstandard, slashed their way\nto a5 \u20144 victory, in a remarkable match which was\nnotable for the number of\ntimes Rebecca found herself\nsitting on the ground, victim of the incredibly slippery floor.\nThe men did equally well,\nfighting back after losing the\nfirst 3 fights, to a final score\nof 6\u20143.\nAlthough IC also fielded\na beginners team, Newham\nwere unable to meet this\nchallenge, so this match had\nto be abandoned.\nThe club now has a nucleus of experienced fencers,\nbut is still very small, so we\nwould welcome any beginners who would like to take\nup this extremely individualistic sport.\nTeams:\nLadies: Rebecca Winnall\n(capt.), Kay Nicholson,\nMargaret Price.\nMen: A. Maguire (capt.), R. Marsden, J. Mitchell.\nR.W. U.L. Cup\nIn the preliminary round\nwe were drawn against Bedford College and we duly\nbeat them by three goals to\none. The I.C. goalscorers\nwere Pratt, Mudan and\nWatson.\nIn the first round off we\nplayed the C.E.M. and were\nvery unlucky to lose 1\u20140,\nthe goal being scored in the\nlast minute of the match. In\nfact I.C. 'scored' four times\nin this match as well as missing three sitters. The whole\nteam played well with Sargent at centre-half, and the\ntwo full-backs, Watson and\nForkes, outstanding.\nMike Burtt\nAthletics\nLast Wednesday ten athletes competed for the UL Relays and Field Events\nTrophus at Motspur Park.\nWhen the morning's rain\nhad been swept off the track\nthe meeting started with\nabout six teams competing.\nGuys were strong as\nusual; too strong for us in\nthe Field Events Competition where the un availability of Rugby players and the\nmysterious non-appearance\nof two key performers left\nus sadly depleted. Revenge\nwas however gained in the\nRelay's Competition where\na strong party of crosscountry runners combined\nwith their sprinters to beat\nGuys into the second place.\nTeam: C. Atkinson, C. Burden,\nS. Fletcher, G. Hunt, R. Jensen, N. Mandeville,\nN. Morrison, D. Quayle,\nM. Robinson and P. Stevenson.\nPaul Stevenson\nT.T. IC kicked off the TT season with a heavy defeat of\nthe 5th team by London\nHospitals powerful trio. The\n4th team started their challenge with a walkover, gaining an easy two points due\nto the non-appearance of\ntheir opponents. Thus the\n4th team goes straight to\nthe top of their league, a position which I firmly\nbelieve will be theirs at the\nend of the season.\nThe 3rd team fell 7\u20143 in\ntheir opening match, but\nshould improve when Mike\nGibson and Co. remove the\ncobwebs from their bats and\nswing into action. The 2nd team is captained by P. Theerathorn, who has been\ngiving good service to the\nclub for seven years, and\nunder the guidance of\n\" cyclotron \", as he is known\nto one and all, this team\nshould do well this season.\nThe 1st team had a ragged start to the year, losing\n6\u20144 to a mediocre team\nfrom QMC, and I think a bit of practice could be useful here. However, its early\ndays yet, and rest assured\nthat IC pin gers will make\ntheir mark in the leagues in\nthe years to come.\nDave Zasikowski\nEDITORIAL\nAs can be seen from the number of reports on this page,\nmost clubs are now well into their fixture lists, and it is\ninteresting to pick out those clubs likely to gain honours\nthis year. The Association Football first XI took maximum\npoints from the first four league games, and although they\nlost 2\u20141 to QMC last Wednesday, they must have a good\nchance of the league. With a4 \u20141 win over UC in the cup\npreliminary round the first XI might even be thinking in\nterms of the ' double ' this year.\nThe rugby club has also had some good results, including\na particularly impressive win against London Irish, and\ndespite a slight falter against LSE they have already beaten\nUC once this season and should deal with them in the\nGutteridge Cup on 19th November.\nAt the time of writing, the Boat Club members are training hard in their constituent college teams for the Morphy\nand Lowry races, held on Wednesday 19th. A change of\nvenue for home matches seems to have affected the ten pin\nbowling club and they are not having the success they knew\nlast season. The basketball club has enough members to\nrun three teams this year, and therefore should have a strong first team.\nFinally, Felix wishes every success to the three members\nof I.C.

W.S.C ICWA Hockey 2;\nRoyal Holloway 0.\nThe ladies hockey team\nmaintained their good form\nof the season with a2 \u20140\nvictory at Harlington against\nRoyal Holloway.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX 20th November, 1969\nA Look Round The Shop\nIt is about this time of year that employers, not only\nfrom this country but from overseas, start their campaigns to\nrecruit their 1970 graduate intake. It is also about this time of\nyear that most students in their final year at university start\nto think (or try to think) seriously about where their money\nis to come from after June. The purpose of this article is\nto make a brief survey of the various types of employment\nthat graduates of the past few years have found popular,\nto swiftly mention the standard ways of obtaining advice\nabout a career and (I hope) to offer some encouragement to\nthose students who like me, found themselves treading water\nin a sea of despair, wondering which island to swim to.\nWhen we talk about employment for science and technology graduates, we should not only include jobs in industry\nand teaching, but also openings for academic work, social\nwork and careers in various government departments. In\n1968, according to an excellent review in \"The Recruiting\nMarket\" in the Guardian of Nov. 12. Consultancy was\nconsidered the most attractive career by the highest proportion of students. This was followed by journalism with\nacademic work, falling from top place in '64, edging industry\ninto 4th place. A career in the forces was considered emphatically the least attractive, despite (or perhaps because\nof) the intensive advertising campaign waged by the Army\nNavy and Airforce in recent years. A high number of students (vi de the author) have come to appreciate the various\nopenings in accountancy.\nThere is, I think, little reason to suppose the thoughts of\nstudents about the attractiveness of various careers have\nchanged significantly in the last year or so, although it is\nprobable that industry is a more attractive proposition than\nacademic work in view of the way that the value of postgraduate grants has fallen steadily in terms of the real value\nof money. In addition, the attractiveness of a career in industry (in terms of the financial reward) is heightened by\nthe fact that, from the point of view of the student, the\nmarket is a seller's one, with the employers in close competition with each other for the most competent graduates.\nJournalism may also, in the future, be able to offer\nThe author of this article, Paul Heath, is an ex-editor\nof Felix, for which work ICU award him Social Colours.\nHe scraped a lower second in Maths last year, and deciding\nhe wanted to get into publishing some way, joined Cambridge University Press as a trainee accountant. He is\nunmarried and has no children.\nincreasing opportunities for scientific and technical graduates\nwith the ability to write clear and lucid English. There are\nmany trade and professional journals around where the\nexpertise of the scientist or engineer can be employed use-fully.\nAccountancy will continue to provide ever more openings and, once an accountant has qualified, the demand for\nhis services, and hence the salaries offered, are very high.\nThere is, of course, the drawback of having to spend 3 or 4\nyears qualifying, but this should be no great difficulty. In\nany case, the vacancies for even partly qualified men are\nnumerous and lucrative.\nGraduate Careers\nby Paul Heath\nFrom that, admittedly brief, survey of trends of em-ploy ment, it will be useful to go on to the means of obtaining\nadvice. The standard way is to see the departmental careers\nadviser and after discussing likes, dislikes and ability, to\nattend selected interviews of firms recruiting at IC or to go\non and see the University Appointment Board Field Officer\nwho visits the college regularly. The person is a specialists\ncareers adviser with numerous contacts in industry, government and the academic world as well as great familiarity\nwith the problems of the graduate student seeking a job.\nMoreover the facilities of the U.L. Appointments Board are\navailable to the graduate throughout his life, not just while\nhe is at college. If you've not decided after going through\ntheir channels, the usual course is to keep an eye on the\nAds. in the \"heavy\" dailies and Sundays. It is also useful\nto keep your eye on Felix \u2014 advertisers who support student\npublications can't be too bad at all !\nInherent in the problem of finding a job is the consideration of whether you will feel happy in it and be capable of success. This is the sort of question which cannot\nbe answered satisfactorily until you have spent a while in\nthe job, but it can be answered with at least some degree Of\nconfidence when you've seen what your prospective employers have to offer. In any case, if for some reason you're\nnot happy in the job you select, because you're unsuited to\nit or even because you're underemployed, any worthwhile\nemployer will not raise objections to you making a change.\nAn interesting statistic is that female graduates spend an\naverage of only six months in their first job. The average for\nmales is greater but the point still remains that it is quite\nrespectable to change a job if it is unsuitable. Anyway it is\nin the employers' interest that his employees should feel\nhappy in their work and the .majority realise this and act\naccordingly.\nIn looking back, I 've come to think that finding suitable employment was less difficult than all the worry and\ninsecurity I felt made it seem. As they used to say on the\nrare occasions that I finished a problem sheet \u2014 \"Christ, if\nHeath can do it, why the Hell can'tI?\" are you\ngraduating\nin 1970?\nare you\nlooking for\nvariety in\nyour\ncareer?\ntick here would you\nlike to play\na part in\nan \u00a380\nmillion\nexpansion\nover the\nnext two\nyears?\nare you\nkeen to\nmove up\nto senior\nmanagement?\nchemicals and plastics\nYES to all four? We'd like to hear from you.\nFor further information please contact\nyour Appointments Board or write to:\nThe Manager, Central Staff Branch,\nBP Chemicals (U.K.) Limited, Stratton Street,\nLondon, W1X 6LS.

It has been noted by\nhis Imperial Majesty that there has been reactionary voting\nin the Imperial people's meetings. This he commands to\ncease!\nLet citizen Torr be an example; his name has been\nremoved from the CEFE mailing list, for reactionary voting.\nThis terrible fate will fall upon all those who oppose our\nbeloved and deified leader.\nLet it be known henceforth that all leftist motions passed\nby in quo rate meetings of the peoples will be passed to the\nImperial Senate, as if the meeting had been quo rate. This\nwill be known as \"democracy\", and those who challenge\nthe quorum will be known as the \"Union bar/Rugby Club\nclique\".\nLet it be known that on XXVII November MCMLXLX\na lounge suit will consist of a mauve sweater and very\nbattered jeans. The Emperor wishes it to be known that he\ncommands more respect than the Queen, but because of\nhis unparalleled and god-like politeness he will allow the\nQueen to open the new Imperial Palace.\nThe Emperor warns the Bost: his infinite patience will\nsoon end. Their knowledge of the Universe gained over\nmany years is nothing, compared to the knowledge of our\nmost beloved leader. They must cease their reactionary\nthinking and accept the words of the Emperor.\nHis august Majesty proclaims that this month's deity\n(after himself) will be: MAO, god of mobs and god of\nbloody carnage. He reminds us that when divine retribution\ncomes from above, it will have the symbols CCCP neatly\nlettered, in red, on its side.\nProclaimed this day, XX November MCMLXIX,\nGAIUS JUSTINIAN\nLyon Playfair Library\n(continued from page 2)\nIn the basement, Level 0, theses are stored.

Some of these volumes are of more historical\nthan academic interest!\nFilm Soc. Travel\nLastly, it cannot be stressed too much that the new library\nfacilities are very much under-used. There must be many\npeople in digs who could use the 500 work spaces in the\nevenings. The best way to keep abreast of the latest scientific\ndiscoveries is to read the periodicals in that field, and what\nbetter way to follow up a subject than to look at the original\npapers? The periodicals section caters for both of these.

We think the feature\nfilms we're showing this year\nare good; you might not have\nrecognised yourself as a disciple hitherto, but if you\ncome to see one then join the\nclub.\nOne of the disadvantages\nof Film Soc is the passive\nnature of 'film appreciation'\nand the lack of contact between audience and organ is ation, a lack of the feeling of\nbelonging to a society.

On\nthe other side were just three short speeches from Ken\nBarker, Dermott Corr, and Gwyn Hughes.\nOne of the points made by the proposer s was that we\nshould join NUS to be able to take part in the policy\nmaking decisions, and over the long term, to see that these\npolicies come to fruition. David Logan emphasised that the\nNUS cannot bring about changes overnight, but suggested\nthat it was constant pressure brought to bear on the University authorities that brought results. If, then, ICU is to gain\nanything from joining the National Union (except for the\ntravel concessions, the importance of which was played]\ndown by all three proposer s) we must remain a member for\na considerable period.\nThis brings me back to my original premise \u2014 that the\ndebate was pushed through the Union far too quickly. The\nmajority of those who voted against the motion at the\nUnion meeting did so not because they were anti-NUS, but\nbecause they felt that (a) as there had not been enough public\ndiscussion before the debate, (b) the proposer s were in such a strong position as compared to the opposition that they\ncould play down their weaker points such as the cost of\njoining, the cost of sending delegates to the bi-annual meeting of delegates and in fact the effectiveness of 4 delegates\nfrom IC amongst over 300 in all.\nThe motion having been pushed through so quickly, there\nmay well be a backlash from those who were not even\naware the NUS vote was being taken, and they could rightly\ninclude in their argument that the Union has been used by\nthe pro-NUS contingent in alliance with President Corbyn.\nOut-dated Posters\nThere seems to be a reluctance on the part of some club\npublicity officers to remove posters immediately after the\nevent being publicised. This is not only true of those placed\non notice boards, but more importantly those placed around\nother places in college. The Debating Society, for example,\nstill (at the time of writing) have posters advertising their\nmeeting on Tuesday, November 11th on every landing in\nLinstead Hall. So wake up publicity officers, it is nice to\nsee adverts for events, but not when they are a week out\nof date.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nEDITOR: MALCOLM WILLIAMSON\nAsst Ed (Production):\nNews Editor: Dave Chant\nNews and production\nassistants: Ian Williams,\nJohn Bowman, Tony Sims,\nMike Yates, Malcolm\nBailey, John Ackers\nBusiness Manager:\nIan Quarrinton\nCirculation \u2014 Sennet and\nFelix: Roger Lindsay\nAsst Ed (Features):\nIan Carr\nWith Steve Giles, Frances\nCampbell\nPhotographic Editor:\nSimon Hoyle\nWith: Andy Thomas,\nArthur Stoller.\nSports Editor: John Darley\nTyping: Susan\nThanks also to: Dave\nWield, Peter Banbury,\nPiers Corbyn, X, Colcutt,\nold uncle Thomas Cobley\nand all.\nNational Advertising: J.

President's Piece\n3 Fields\nThe Union has clear policies in 3 important fields:\nDiversification, Representation and the Architectural\nAssociation merger, and\nwants early statements from\nthe administration on them.\nFollowing Councils' (Nov.\n10) discussion of the present\nsituation, which reinforced\nwhat I have been saying to\nthe Admin, for some weeks,\nI wrote a letter to the Rector (see elsewhere in Felix)\nconcerning the Nov. 12th Board of Studies meeting.\nThe main subject of discussion at the Nov. 12 special\nmeeting was the A. A. The\nBOSt was asked by the\nUnion to discuss our ideas\non the A. A. and hence\nalso representation.\nThe A. A. negotiations are\nnow at a crucial stage, as is\nrevealed by some surreptitiously obtained documents\nyet we are excluded from\ndiscussions.\nA special meeting of the\nDeans Committee was called\nafter the Nov. 12 BOSt meetings the results of which\nshould be conveyed to\nJURGO on Monday 17th and the Union meeting on\nThursday 20.\nDiversification\nthe BOSt to set up a diversification \u2014 co-ordination\ncommittee (as reported in\nthis week's(!)I.C. news.)\nThe report implies that the\ndecision is something to do\nwith the Nov. 12th BOSt\nwhich it is not!\nAnyway, confusion apart,\nwe are still waiting to be represented on this committee.\nWe will re-state that a central college organisation is\nvitally needed \u2014 a co-ordinating committee which works\nwithin existing resources is\njust not enough!\nWell, what is stopping the\nadministration going forward at full speed on diversification and representation?\nGovernment reports, stud-ents, many staff and a good\nnumber of admin are all in\nfavour.\nThe great difficulty I had\nin obtaining the minutes of\nthe special June meeting of\nthe BOSt which discussed\nlast years representation re-quests, and the ghastly \"dis-cus sion\" which took place\nthere, gives the answer.\nBackward looking Professors and department heads\nform a strong vocal group\non the BOSt, the progressives\ndo not speak out.\nThe BOSt reports to the\nGoverning body (for which\nThe Oct. 29 decision by (continued in column 5)\nSomeone\nmade a fortune\nout of this Your innovation may not make a fortune but it may be the basis for\nstarting or rapidly expanding your own business.\nTD C helps finance commercially-minded scientists, engineers, and\ndesigners in the development and exploitation of worthwhile\ninnovations.

On reading my copy, I find\nmyself in total agreement with those staff who spoke against\nrepresentation especially Professor Chain when he said that\nthere could never be equality between \"Masters and Disciples\", that the whole affair was just political muck-raking\nand that the staff should not give in to these marijuana-crazed, poetry-writing, sandal-wearing, orange-juice drinking,\nsissy, long-haired thugs as \"appeasement never pays\".\nWhilst on the subject, I wonder if the College Authorities\nare aware of what took place in the RCS Union office last\nWednesday: Henry (Heroin Experience and Nude Romps for\nYouth), the College excuse for mass drug and sex orgies,\nput on a so-called Sensory Adventure. Never have I seen\nanything so obscene as the 40 people leaving, smiling and\nbeing friendly to each other, obviously under the influence\nof drugs as I saw nothing to be amused about.\nTrue to the so-called \"democracy\" of the left, last years\nreferendum was totally ignored and a Union Meeting passed\na motion for joining NUS. Once again IC will become part\nof the \"mass student movement\" which gives students such\na bad name and it could force IC to lose its reputation as\nthe most forward-lo king and well-behaved College in the\ncountry.\nWhilst on the subject of money, coming up at today's Union meeting is a motion to investigate links of IC with\nracist regimes and companies who provide money for us.\nSurely we can trust our academic superiors, the admin is tra tion, to make sure of the moral consequences of our finances.\n(continued from column 4)\nthe F and E Committee\nacts) and the F and E can\ninstruct the BOSt. Have the\nRector and the other members of the F and E got the\ncourage to stand up to the\n\"Backward-look ers\" and instruct the BOSt on our \"3\nfields\"? They meet on Fri.\n21, they could decide then!\nWhat can we\ndo?\nThe Admin fear adverse\npublicity and the Queen has\nthe power to change I.C.'s Royal Charter. It is for these\nreasons that council suggested that we should (if necessary) petition the Queen and\nissue a public statement on\nNov. 27. This moderate proposition is not anti-monarchist but the best attempt we\ncan make to fulfilling Union\npolicy. You must come to the\nUGM today to discuss it, and\ndecide what to say to the\nF and E.N. U.S. Well . . . we've joined.\nApart from LEAs paying\nfor the benefits we already\ngot we can get further positive help from NUS on for\ninstance: information, confer-en ces, Union 'demands',\nSabbatical year, legal advice,\ncompetitions, etc. This is a step forward!\nSome people say there was\nnot enough discussion on\nNUS. Well, discussion has\nbeen going on since last year\n\u2014 the people who don't want\nus to join were always quite\nfree to protest more discussion \u2014 they knew NUS\nwould come up! I even\nasked some of them to write\nan anti-NUS piece for a leaflet with a Same length pro-NUS piece \u2014 they didn't \u2014\ninstead they say we shouldn't have joined because there\nhasn't been enough discus-sion. That is an easier way\nout hardly valid. Anyone\ncan start a discussion!\nA lot of people still\nhaven't got their Handbooks,\nBluebooks, USK Broadsheets and UL U cards \u2014\ncome to the Union office and\nfetch them when you fetch\nyour Union Directory.\nRefectories-Ugh Next Issue\nAn operation research\nstudy is urgently needed. If\nthe refectory committee continues to be obstructive,\ncouncil suggests a food strike\n\u2014 this is probably the only\nanswer \u2014 discuss at the\nUnion meeting.\nThe Union and college\ncould be far more socially\nuseful and relevant to every-body.

Votes to Rejoin N.U.S. Did You Know?\nAt the first Union Meeting to toe held in the new\nGreat Hall in College Block,\nindeed the first massed\ngathering in that noble\nplace, the Union voted in\nfavour of rejoining the National Union of Students\nafter an absence of thirteen\nyears.\nThe meeting opened nor-m ally, late. Mr. Seaford\napologised humbly that there\nwere no carpets to place our\ndainty feet upon, and hoped\nwe would excuse the inefficiency of I.C's administration and himself in not\nhaving the place ready for\nus.\nAccording to Ken Weale's financial report, I.C. union\nis technically in the red, to\nthe tune of \u00a3900, but this\nwas offset by investments of\n\u00a31,620, and Mr. Weale\nthinks the Union should just\nget by this year.\nDave Wield proposed the\nmotion that I.C.U. rejoin\nN.U.S. His arguments, he\nadmitted, were much the\nsame as Jack Straw (N.U.S. president) gave at I.C,a fortnight ago (see page ten\nfor a fuller report). Piers\nasked for someone to speak\nagainst the motion. No one\nstirred. Disbelief among old\nhands at I.C., for this perennial motion has provided\ngrist to the mill of I.C. debaters for donkeys years.\nKen Barker spoke. He\ndidn't, he said, really want\nto speak against the motion\nbut he thought more time\nshould be devoted to consider such items as cost,\nfeelings of other colleges\nnot in N.U.S. For Mr. Barker this was no matter to be\ntreated lightly.\nLes Ebdon obviously\nthought this poor stuff and\ngirding his loins strode\nacross to the microphone.\nMore time, Les said, but\nwe've been bandying this\nidea about for thirteen years.\nCost? Anthony Crosland\nhimself, in his halcyon days\nas Minister of Education\ngave an assurance at an I.C. general studies lecture that\njoining N.U.S. would be a valid reason for an increase\nin Union fees. Sailing on in\nfull command of his subject,\nother bogies were laid to\nrest without anybody even\nraising them. Participation,\nstudent unrest, the student\nimage. Only through being\nmembers of a national union\ncould I.C. Union make an\nimpression on national student affairs such as these.\nBlasting away through the\namazing acoustics of the\nGreat Hall Les entreated the\nUnion to join N.U.S. again.\nGwyn Hughes was un-affected, in his opinion joining N.U.S. would double the\nworkload of council, and,\nquoth he, Who would listen\nto Corbyn anyway at an\nN.U.S. conference.\nDavid Logan, of N.U.S. executive give his views to\nthe meeting and pertinent\nquestions directed at him\nfrom the floor drew lucid\nreplies. Someone asked if\nN.U.S. can do anything\nmore concrete than demon-st rate? Nobody ever gets\neverything he asks for said\nMr. Logan. How big a voice\nwould I.C. have in N.U.S.? Mr. Logan said that college\nrepresentatives control N.U.S. through a proportional representation scheme of delegates with voting rights.\nN.U.S.'s achievements rolled\nfreely from Mr. Logan's lips, but the Union was\nwary. Dennis Taylor even\nmore so. He asked if four\nhundred students at a Union\nmeeting could accurately reflect the feelings of the whole\nof Imperial College on this\nissue. A deep question which\ndrew a deep reply from\nDavid Logan on the use of\ndemocratic structures, They\nexist for people to use and\nif an insufficient number of\npeople use the system then\ngovernment must continue\nin the absence of interest.\nSomeone sneak i ly asked\nabout last years unfavourable referendum on joining\nN.U.S. Irrelevant, said Mike\nGreen, if people had wanted\nto come and vote, they\nwould have done so.\nThe sands of time were\nrunning out as two thirty\napproached. Dave Wield\nsummed up, Mr. Guy asked\nif visitors would stand u o and be counted. So the president of the A. A. and Chris\nWalmsley, president of U.C., stood up and were deftly\ncounted. The vote was 192\nfor, 143 against and 7 ab-stent ions. Piers applied for membership last Monday, and membership should be ratified\nsoon.\nThis years' Carnival is for\nthe Society for Mentally\nHandicapped Children and\nCarnival has already collected some money ! ? Guilds\nis doing phenomenally well,\nhaving collected more than\n\u00a3270, including \u00a3150 from\nthe Lord Mayor's Show and\nmost of the rest at the\nGuilds - Mines terrifying\ntid d ly winks tournament.\nR.C.S. also did well out of\nthe crazy conker ing in the\nKing's Road. R.C.S. netted\nmore than \u00a3100 from a pedestrian speed trap there\nto total \u00a3210. Mines has also\ncollected about \u00a353 !\nIt seems that carnival can\nraise a lot of money collecting at such events and\nthere is no reason for not\nenjoying yourself at the\nsame time, so how about\nsupporting the Trad Jazz\nGroup busking in High\nStreet Ken. on 22nd. of\nNovember. This, plus last\nweekend's bed-race to Southampton and the three legged\npub crawl provide devious\nforms of entertainment for\nanyone with enough energy\nto lift a collecting tin in one\nhand and a beer in the other.\nThis term's Carnival Week\nis from 28th of November\nto 6th of December and\nseems to be well supported\nby feet, with the round Britain hitch-hiking race starting on 28th November, and\nthe Carnival Walk starting between eleven and midnight on the 5th of December. Those arriving back\nsore of foot and parched of\nthirst will be greeted by girls\nof Maria Assumpta bearing\nbreakfasts. A Darts Marathon is also among events\nproposed for that week so\nwhat about volunteers from\nthe Union Bar.\nA successful Albert Hall\nConcert will be the main feature of next term's Carnival\nWeek, followed by a fe te.

Charles Dodgson (alias Lewis Carroll)\nDear Sir,\nIn response to the very reasonable expressed desire of\nstudents in the College, many departments have introduced\nnon-scientific subjects into their undergraduate curricula.\nHowever, the result makes one very suspicious that it is a stop-gap action to placate a current trend. It might also\nhave been a conspiracy to convince students at Imperial\nCollege that non-technical subjects are not worth studying.\nHaving spent the last three years as an Electrical Engineering undergraduate, I regret the prosaic inclusion of nontechnical studies in the syllabus. The status of liberal\nstudies increases from a virtual non-existence in the first\nyear to a total of one, two, or three subjects (as the student\nchooses) in the final year. Surely, the reverse order, with\na wider range of non-scientific subjects read in the initial\npart of the course, will be more appropriate in introducing\nthe fresher to engineering.\nBalanced\nMost, if not all, students come to I.C. to benefit from\nits specialised training. Some also come to be educated, and\nit is not Mephistophelean to gently persuade the rest that a well-balanced education is congenial.\nTo develop an imaginative liberal studies programme in\nengineering faculties requires care, consideration and com-pete n ce. Ludicrous combinations, such as parallel courses\nin Twentieth Century Literature and Modern Drama, should\nclearly be avoided (assuming that Pulitzer Prize aspirants\nwill not have drifted into our company).\nThe worth of an introductory economics course in an\nengineering curriculum is generally acknowledged. But,\nfinal year engineering students cannot be expected to be\nenthused by a course based ashamedly on a first year or\nperhaps Pre-University) test for economics students. Not\nsurprisingly, the attendance on the economics course during\nthe last session fell very noticeably as the year progressed;\nmost of the remaining students depended on that subject\nto satisfy course requirements.\nSimilar tales of woe beset all studies non-technical.. Departmental lieutenants do not appear to dignify these\nsubjects with much care or attention, even while they swear\nan equivalent weighting of these subjects with their technical counterparts in the final assessment.\nDangers\nSurely, I.C. cannot afford to retrogress in a day and age\nin which the dangers of over specialization are consistently\nemphasised.\nThe solution is obvious, even if it is not simple. Taking\nthe cue from the establishment of an Industrial Sociology\nunit it is not unreasonable to expect the creation of a department to co-ordinate the liberal studies programme in\nthe various faculties of the College.\nThe task of providing non-scientific studies in the co un try's leading technological institute should not be under-estimated. It has to be executed prof es iona i ly and efficiently,\nso that those who seek to acquire scientific and engineering\nskills of the highest quality in Ithe context of a balanced\neducation do not have to go west.\nYours sincerely,\nA.H.S. Loh (CCA.)\nNo Need For Bar\nDear Felix,\nSo the student houses are going to be 'anonymous conglomerations of cheap rooms' unless facilities for the sale\nof ale ho holi c drinks are provided. (Felicity correspondent\nfrom Mining House). Is the level of personality of the\npeople in these places so low that they cannot be sociable\nwithout the aid of a depressant drug ? Is it true that the\nonly social community they experience is when they all puke\ncommunally on the floor?\nShame.\nHowever, rather than allow this state of affairs to persist,\nI suggest that the Chemistry dept. produce sufficient quantity\nof LSD and give it to these people so that they can either\ndecide to communicate on a more human level or jump\noff Colcutt's tower.\nYours expectantly,\nDoctor K.( Name supplied).\nCapitalism\nDefended\nSir,\nA few days ago, I noticed\na number of leaflets around\nCollege public ising 'Captive\nNations Week'. When I had\nrecovered from the shock of\nseeing a leaflet which was\nnot published by Piers\nCorbyn, I was intrigued by\nthe figures on the back of\nthe leaflet. These added up\nto the astounding total of\nnearly 100 million deal as\na result of the application\nof Marxist-Leninist ideology \u2014 making the late and\nun lamented Herr Hitler look\nlike an amateur!\nThe leaflet warns us\nagainst indifference and\napathy, the very malaise\nwhich must have struck this\ncollege last year, when I.C. chose to be run (overrun?)\nby those lovers of top-heavy\nbureaucracy, the left wing.\nIt is about time that we\nrealised the dangers of\nallowing ourselves to swing\ntoo rapidly towards social-ism. A great difficulty lies\nin the fact that the most\npublicised of a socialist's views are good humanitarian\nprinciples with which most\nof us agree. The dangerous part of his views is\nthat his Utopia will be achieved by a sudden revolution,\nwhich will tear down the establishment and replace it\nwith an all - powerful\n'people's state'.\nAn often overlooked advantage of capitalism is that\nit allows a far greater freedom of speech and move-ment. In a capitalist state\nno one group ever gains\ncomplete control, there is a continuous struggle for supremacy within the upper\nreaches of society, with the\nstate but one faction among\nmany, and no group can get\nin the position to impose its\nown ideas and suppress\nothers. This is greatly to the\nbenefit of the 'lower classes'\nwho gain a relatively large\namount of real power.\nUnder socialism, the\n'upper class' consists of one\ngroup, the state, which is\nfree to impose its views\nupon the rest of society by\nany means, usually violent,\nas we can see from the 19\nmillion deaths in Soviet labour camps between 1921\nand 1960.\nThe stated principles of\nthe left (equality, etc.) are\nnot undesirable, it is only\ntheir way of imposing them\nwhich is unwise. It is (or\nshould be) the job of the\nmoderates and the right\nwing to keep a check on the\nchildishly impatient left, and\nto slow them down so that\nwe may ultimately achieve\nan equilibrium to the benefit of the whole of society.\nIan Williams, E.E.3 Dear Sir,\nDuring this term IC Union\nand ULU have been trying to\nfight racial discrimination in\nLodgings, and now against\nhigher hall fees for overseas\nstudents. The only people\nwho benefit from these actions are the overseas stu-dents, as far as I can see,\nand many of them have\nvolubly argued their case in\nthe Union.\nWhen I myself queried the\nplace of overseas students in\nIC (see FELIX number 281,\npage 3), many British students in IC rallied in opp osi tion, talking about \"in te gra tion\" and \"intellectual cross-pollination\". It appears,\nthen, that British students\nhave been doing their best to\npromote integration. Some\neven wish to demonstrate\nagainst higher Hall fees, risking legal action.\nPersonally, I would not expect the overseas students to\ntry and prevent this in te gra tion, but on Friday, 7th November, the Overseas Students\nCommittee held a party in\nWeeks Hall.\nWhat did the notice say ?\n\"Overseas Students only\"!\nThis advert was an insult\nto ULU and ICU. Should we\nBritish members of the Union\nbe told we are not accept-able? We can fight discrimination against overseas stud-ents, but we must be discriminated against ourselves. This\nis insulting ingratitude!\nThe person or persons responsible should either apologise, or, if he has the nerve,\njustify this action in these\npages. I imagine that some of\nthe overseas students themselves were likewise horrified\nat the offending notice, and I would urge them to set up an\nenquiry into this. How can\nwe fight external racism if\nwe have this sort of behaviour internally ?\nUntil a satisfactory apology or explanation is re-ce i ved, IC Union should refrain from discussing the\nproblems of O/S students. If\nwe are not good enough for\ntheir social acceptance, they\nmust indeed be superior\nenough to fight their own\nbattles! George X Revolution On Jrelix\nDear Editor,\nHaving read Mr. Cyril\nSmith's comments in Felix\non \"The Coming Revolution\", I would like to point\nout the utter hypocrisy\nwhich runs through the con-versa tion. The key quote in\nit is thus:\n\"For us our principles are\nscientific principles, and we\nwouldn't bend them for any-body\".\nThe quotation by Mr.\nSmith denotes the fundamentals of Stalinism, which he\nso laboriously condemns.\nThe fact that he considers\nhis scientific principles to be\nmore important than people\n(\"we wouldn't bend them for\nANYBODY\"), typifies the\ntotally inhuman and bureaucratic nature of Stalinism,\nand sets him well on the road\nto Fascism. What on earth\nmakes him think that because he has stuck Trotsky\non to the end of his list of\ngods. Marx and Lenin, that\nhe is fighting for a social\nsystem that would be any\nless bureaucratic and inhuman than that the Russian\nrevolution has obtained? I would have thought that if\nanyone wants to be a poli-tic ian, they should be obsessed with the desire to give\npeople a free and happy life,\nand not be obsessed with\nimposing their \"scientific\nprinciples\" on society.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Thomason,\nChairman Political\nSocieties Council.\nDear Sir,\nFelix became established\nas a newspaper wm cn presented news and features in\nat actual B.t JC type man-ner. With me rise of the\nConstituent College news-sheets it became apparent\ntn at there were two types of\npapers\u2014one which reported\nnews in a chatty style, often\nintermingled with the re-porter's views; and there\nwas Felix. The new sheets were able to get away with\nthis because they were up to\ndate, didn't cost much, and\nwere regarded by the 'es-tabl ish ment' as a transient\n'thing'.\nBut in the last issue of\nFelix, the style of reporting\nhad degenerated to that of\nthe new sheets, yet most of\nthe material was one or two\nweeks out of date. In short\nFelix had become nothing\nmore than a very expensive,\nvery well printed and very\nout of date new sheet for\nICU\u2014and if this is what\nFelix is to remain then the\nannual grant of \u00a3800 cannot be justified.\nTrying to compete with\nthe new sheets on their own\nground would be suicide for\nFelix, and to do away with\nFelix would be a grave mis-take. There is room for the\ntwo types of paper; the\nnew sheets with their up-to-date conversational tone and\npictures of octopuses, and\nFelix which should (and\nmust) present news and\nfeatures in detail in a factual\nand unbiased manner.\nIn this way, perhaps we\ncan both get along together\nwithout any slamming.\nDirect competition would be\nfolly, but the occasional prod\nand overlap is beneficial to\nboth.\nH.J. Matthews,\nS.F. Morrisby\n(Ed and Asst Ed,\nRCS Broadsheet)\nN.U.S. Debate\nCriticised\nDear Sir,\nWe and others present at\ntoday's Union meeting,\nwhere it was decided to join\nN.U.S., would like to express regret that a decision\nwhich affects the whole of\nthe college union was taken\nat a meeting where less than\na tenth of the union was\npresent.\nWhilst we appreciate the\nreasons for joining the\nN.U.S., we disapprove\nstrongly of the manner in\nin which this decision was\nmade. As this was an ;\ns sue affecting every member of\nthe union, we feel that more\nof an effort should have\nbeen made to present the\ncase fairly to every student;\ninstead of having a chairman clearly seen to be biased\nand lack of information\nfrom the opposition,\ns We therefore sincerely\nhope that in the future a referendum will be taken on\nany equally important issue.\nYours faithfully,\nS.P.

The best are\nAstronomy Domine and Saucerful of Secrets; i the first,\ncomposed by the group's former lead guitarist Syd Barret, is a nervous, jerky, rhythmic song to music that\ncontinually ebbs and flows in\nvolume, while ' Saucerful'\ngradually builds up to a cli-max, lessens, them goes in\ncrescendo to a finale which\nhas to be heard to be appreciated. The studio album is much\nless appealing on the first\nhearing; each member of the\ngroup seems to have been\ngiven a free hand to do what\nhe wanted for ten minutes,\nwhich is all very well, and\nsome very interesting music\nis produced, but tracks like\nSeveral Species of Small\nFurry Animals Gathered Together and Grooving With a Pict will appeal to a very specialised group of Floyd ad-mir ers. Free\nThe Free\nIsland LLPS\nThis the second LP to be\nproduced this year by this\ngroup. Some of the tracks are\nvery good without being out-standing, while others are just\nthe regular derivative rock\nsongs so many groups are reV\ni cio us Circles What is this thing religion?\nAt least two things as far\nas I can see. There is the Religion of the established\nchurches, the Christian Religion, Mohammedan Religion\netc., which have been formalised so that they are acceptable to a large number of\npeople because within their\ndogma, there is such a freedom that one can pick and\nchoose one's own way\nthrough them. Then there is\nreligion best defined, I think,\nas that which is manifested\nin the individual's sp ritual relationship to his environment.\nThe first involves a belief in\nthe dogma of the particular\nreligion, the second the belief\nin whatever the believer holds\nto be of import. The common factor in both of these\ncording these days. Certainly\nthe group has improved immeasurably since the day of\nlast year's Albert Hall Ents.\nconcert, when they opened\nthe first half of the show. So\nlisten to it and you may\nlike it.\nFour Sail\nLove, Transatlantic\nApart from the atrocious\ntitle, this LP is good value\nfor money. Love seems to be\nbuilt around the musical talents of Arthur Lee, who composes most of their work and\nplays various different instruments. Again, most of the\nmusic is simple blues and\nrock without originality\nshowing itself to any degree,\nbut there is always an audience for just that. After all,\nthink how many groups\nstarted in just that way, and\nare now experimenting in the\nmis named \"underground\".\nThe predominance of Lee's musicality in Love's music\nbrings you to wonder just\nhow many groups suffer from\nthe same defect. Certainly,\nPete Townshend, Winwood,\nKeith Emerson of the Nice,\nand to a lesser extent, Jagger and Lennon, all contributed the major amount to\ntheir group's work, and, with\nthe Floyds' L.P. in mind\nagain, you are caused to wonder just how much Syd Barrett's composing talents were\nresponsible for the group's early success.\nSingles\nThree singles came my\nway this week for me to try\nto write both some p seu d re-views, and also please the\npublishers.\nis the belief; that is, the\nacceptance of something as\ntrue; which by extension involves the introduction of the\nbeliefs in the believer's store\nof knowledge.\nWhy is it necessary to go\nthrough the rigmarole of religion merely to get to this\nstage of accepting something\nas true, and therefore usable\nas a day to day criterion for\naction? Historically, religion\n(and Religion) were used to\nexplain the things supernatural which could not be rationally understood. As the\nsupernatural is a dynamic\nconcept more suited to explanation by today's science\nthan by religion, this role is\nof diminishing importance.\nHowever, one reason for\nbelief which is still important\nis the need for mental sec ur \"Naturally\", by Fat Mattress, who have been to IC\nthis term, has a very catchy\nand distinctive guitar sequence predominating. Generally fast, loud and good.\n\"The World's An Apple\"\nby Big Bertha featuring (sic)\nAce Keiford, sounds like a rehash of \"Natural Born\nBugie\" by Humble Pie. The\nsimilarity really is quite\nnoticeable. However as \"Nat-ural Born Bugie\" was a good\nrecord, I liked this one also.\nLastly and least ly was\n\"Pretty Girl Why\", by Buffalo Springfield. A pleasant\nsound but not particularly\nspecial.\nLUNCHTIME\nO 'DISQUE\nLiterary\nForeign Scum\nLSE : The Natives are\nRestless\nPaul Hoch & Vic Sehoenbach\nSheed & Ward : 10s. This book has been written\nand published in the minimum possible time in an all-out effort by the publishers\nto get it on the book-stands\nbefore LSE fades in our\nminds. The result is what one\nwould expect as far as the\nbook's composition goes, with\nsubscripts to every page,\nquotes from all and sundry\nscattered throughout the text,\nand occasional passages\nwhere one is led to believe\nthat whoever was carefully\nsub editing away all the\nMike Westbrook brought Jazz to IC. Next week\nFELIX tells how Miles Davis brought Jazz to\nJazz Expo '69.\nit y,i theme ed to know some-thing. I'm almost tempted to\nsay anything, on which one's spiritual existence can be\nbased. Many people me ed this\nin the same way that people\nneed the physical security of\njob, family, established society with all its conventions,\netc. It is perhaps the need for\ncertainty im a world where\nnothing is certain \u2014 do you\nknow 'that the sum is going to\ncome up tomorrow ?\nFurther, in pursuit of happiness there is always a clash\nbetween the national dem ents and the emotional elements\nin Us. This clash can be lessened if there is something\nthe intellect cam accept to be;\non this basis it could perhaps\nresolve the oom fli ot which\noccurs whan the emotions demand answers while the rational 'person knows there are\nnone.\nHow, you may say, do\nthese vast generalities relate\nto my religious beliefs, which\nis what this article is supposed to be about. Very\nsimply. You see, I believe all\nthe above. And you will\nnotice that this belief effectively serves me as a religion.\nFor, while on rational\ngrounds, the only tenet I accept is the contradiction \"If\nI know one thing it is that I know nothing\". I believe im\nmy me ed to believe, to know,\nand my belief is firm enough\nto keep me happy, which (I believe) is the end point of\nmy belief.\nIm this complex of vicious\ncircles, I sit back and smile\nsmugly . . . . J. H.C. authors' wilder comments\nand ideas, missed.\nAll this could obscure the\nfact that a greater part of the\nbook is a factual, day-by-day\naccount of the sit-ins, occupations, strikes and marches\norganised by the active members of LSE. It stresses that\nall the much-publicised taking down of gates, forming of\npicket-lines and invasion of\nLSE staff facilities was not\njust the action of a small active group of foreign a gita tors, but the result of long\nUnion discussion. All the\nattempts to defy the governing bodies of the school were\npassed by large majorities at\nUnion meetings, where, incidentally, they get a hell of a lot more people turning up\nthan they do here.\nIt's biased, of course, Hoch\nand Schoenbach being proud\nmembers of the \"foreign\nscum\" refusing to be downtrodden by disciplinarian\nattitude of Adams and Co.,\nbut it's not too one-sided to\nstop you seeing that this isn't just a lot of students causing\ntrouble for the sake of causing trouble. It overwhelmingly points out time and\ntime again the fantastic anti-student bias that exists in the\npress and in the minds of the\nolder generations, and it does\nthis by quoting excerpts from\nthe Dailies (you can guess\nwhich ones), and from speeches made by MPs and\nindustrial heads.\nThe bias is something\neveryone knows about, it's caused by lack of com muni cation, which is easy to say\nbut seemingly impossible to\ndo anything about. Throughout the book you are assailed\nby the complete inability of\nany of the protagonists to see\nany point of view other than\ntheir own.\nThe Natives are Restless is\nthe first report on this subject to put forward a concise\naccount of what the students\ndid and why they did it, and\nit's worth reading for that\nalone, but it also lets you see\njust what the \"agitators\"\nthought they were fighting\nfor.\nINFORMATION\nFUN AND GAMES\nThe Institute of Contemporary Arts situated in The Mall\nhas a comprehensive programme of films, exhibitions, plays\nand concerts throughout the year. The Union has a block\nmembership and you can get a membership card on production of your registration card in the Union office. This will\nenable you to buy rickets at much reduced prices.\nReplacing the John Heartfield exhibition from 28th November will be Play Orbit, an exhibition which explores various aspects of toys. It includes giant games, toys for adults\nand one toy each from over a hundred artists. The exhibition\nruns until after Christmas, 11 a.m.7 p.m. daily; admission\n4s. for members (that's you).\nRECORDS\nDiscount on records can be obtained at Mascall Records in\nS. Kensington on production of your registration card. Student discount is also available at the record stall in Kensington Market, Kensington High Street. In fact, there are a few\nstalls in the market which give discount so it's worth asking\nif you're shopping there.\nCLOTHES\nVast sums of money aren't required to provide a costume\nfor Carnival or to infuse a bit of variety into the traditional\nstudents' modes of dress. Here are a few ideas:\nJumble Sales provide a surprisingly wide range of clothing.\nYou can get shirts, trousers, vests and jackets for 6d. to 1/-.\nWhite or light coloured clothes can be dyed very cheaply\nwith dye obtainable from any hardware shop. East End markets like Petticoat Lane usually have second-hand and surplus stalls; all it needs is a good eye and some imagination.\nThere are second-hand clothes shops and stalls in Portobello\nRoad Market and also two shops in nearby Pembridge\nRoad selling old theatrical clothes.\nDUPLICATING\nThe Union duplicating equipment can be used by any member of the Union. If you need any duplicating done see Jon\nMoont in 415 Tizard, who can supply materials. The dye line machine in the union cloakroom is also available for doing\nposters, if you supply your own materials, bought from the\nbookshop. See Deputy President Pete Earl (Beit Hall) for\ndetails.\n\n"
