The Board seems to see its function as one of promoting scientific study abroad, but any student who has this leaning can\ndo his Ph D abroad, oh take full advantage of N.U.S. and other organisations running trips overseas in the long vacations.

    "content": "COM MEN I \"by the\"' editor THE RECENT mixed fortunes and misfortunes of the University of Lon don newspaper SENNET, with avast succession of editors and compliments at this year's Student Journalists' Conference once again leads one (or at least this one) to ask, what makes a student newspaper ?\nTwo things are essential its staff and the pride they bear in the job in which they are engaged.\nThat these are the only criteria is certainly not the case.\nFor instance, the quality of production can well boost a newspaper's staff's ego. Bedford College's INNER CIRCULAR next month goes into print. One day, perhaps, South London' s SMITHS NEWS too will grow out\nof the realm of the duplicated\" gro t sheet\". In an issue such as this( you may\nrecall that we rana similar one in January), critics would say that FELIX is steering a a tern ward course. FELIX is, however, the most effective publicity medium in the College, and should be providing a news service right through the academic year. At the beginning of term there is too little time to produce a full size offset printed edition and its cost would be prohibitive. There are yet other reasons for publishing such an issue. Not only is it an exercise in the use of an\nexcellent facility that we have inherited from former FELIX staffs and\nwhich the Union acquired specifically for FELIX use some four years ago\nthe duplicator but it gives us\nthe opportunity to try out new techniques, but it also follows that should we at any time be faced with a national printing strike, FELIX\nWILL NOT CLOSE (to purloin a well known quotation) and be blacklisted, no doubt i At least, FELIX will not close unless this facility is lost, as has\nbeen threatened. More important, though less adventurous, is the pre sent late deadline for Late News,\neven now less than three years old.

Mr\nAnthony, the College Fire Officer, says that the Southside fire precautions are now in full working order a fe tr extensive repairs over Easter carried out by the College main te nance department despite their inability to obtain wiling diagrams from\nthe contractors who installed the\noriginal system (Mr Seaford, the\nDomestic Bursar, commented, \"We expect this fi or new buildings iV)\nAt a test this morning (Tuesday)\nin the presence of the Domestic Bur sar and the F:_ re Officer the notorious Balcony gates worked perfectly, and will now be kept locked except\nin emergency.\nMr Anthony told FELIX that a fire practice would probably be held during this term, and that apart from\none or two instances of fire alarm bells being wedged with paper m he\nwas well pleased with the cooperation received from students in the\nmatter of fire safety. \"The imp or tant thing,\" he said,\" is that we\nshould keep the boys' confidence.\" AN OCTOPUS LARGER THAN LIFE? A LARGE OCTOPUS, healthy sun tans,& a great deal of experience were\ngained by the members of the Under water Club's expedition to the South\nof France over Easter. The party camped at La Ciotat, be tween Marseille and Toulon, where\nconditions for diving were excellent \u2014 visibility up to 100 ft. During the eight days of diving, spear fishing became very popular \u2014\ncatches consisting mn in ly of squid, cuttlefish and octopus. Two members\nof the party were very successful in finding octopus and they teamed up. They found one which was larger than they bargained for, and proved too\nstrong to invert under water; with its tentacles round both of them they had to make for the cliffs and kill it out of water \u2014\u2022 at full stretch it was nearly five feet long. SEN NET SALES DOWN SALES OF SENNET, the ULU newspaper,\nhave fallen from 6000 at the beginning of the year to some 3000 last term - - figures almost identical to last year. At IC, which achieves the largest sale of any of the Colleges, last term's sales were down to600 copies; at LSE only100 per issue were\nbeing sold. Meanwhile sales of FELIX have gone up over the Christmas term\nto achieve record sales in Lent. "

NUS\nwould be financially out of\npocket if IC resolved to join the national organisation. This is because NUS now receives three times the annual subscription every year from individual members, NUS claimed to the student press over\nEaster. The annual subscription of a student union to NUS is usually paid for by a levy separate from the normal Union fee ( this works out at about2^6 per student), and IC Union would be out of pocket only for the period until the next review of the Union fee. NUS however would lose some\nhundreds of pounds per year( the individual fee is \u00a31).\nIC) and Maggie Butterworth( LSE) who were dismissed at the last ULU Council Meeting.

Refused entry\nFELIX reporter Frank Fuchs was refused credentials to NUS Council, because IC is not affiliated and because\nhe personally is known as a severe critic of NUS Exec. A number of delegations tried to question this decision, but were steamrollered by the expert chairmanship of Bill Savage. Prior to the Council Fuchs\nhad been working at. lar well. An NUS spokesman described him as\" a security risk\". "
