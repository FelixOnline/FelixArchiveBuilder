    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n8 | SCIENCE 15 November 2024\nleased into the market.\nVaccines have never been seen as a solution to AMR,\nbut now the perception has changed. Vaccines prevent\nthe acquisition of antibacterial resistance because they\nprevent infection itself. Recent data on pneumococcal,\ninfluenza, and salmonella vaccines show that by vaccinating you reduce antibiotic use and slow down AMR.\nAt this stage, however, only one remedy isn\u2019t enough\n\u2013 we need a combination of vaccines with phages, new\ndrugs, or monoclonal antibodies. This is why coordinated effort is crucial. While every country is investing in\nviral pandemic preparedness, we also need this effort\nfor AMR.\nQ. What are your current plans and research aimed\nat as the new co-director of CBRB, Centre of Bacterial Resistance Biology at Imperial?\nAs co-director of CBRB, I hope that we will be able to\nbuild cross-disciplinary interest. I was amazed at first\nto see how many interesting projects there were and I\nthink now is the opportunity. AMR, as I mentioned be-fore, can only be solved by multidisciplinary approaches and this is exactly what CBRB and Imperial have in\nplace. We have scientists working on vaccines, phages,\nanimal models, clinical models, and immune response\nanalysis.\nMy interest at the moment is Klebsiella pneumoniae.\nOver the years after the meningococcal B vaccine devel-opment, I have been learning how to reduce the number\nof antigens to consider. So now, I\u2019ve already identified a\nfew proteins that have the potential to be interesting antigens and we are starting the characterisation process.\nQ. What are some effective ways that academic researchers can engage with policymakers to drive\nvaccine access and education?\nThe aspects of access and education are fundamental.\nEducation is the starting point \u2013 you people should be\ntaught from a young age the importance of vaccination\nand the damage of infectious disease. There are infectious diseases you don\u2019t see anymore, like polio, and we\nforget that this is because we have been vaccinated. I\nthink that a few things need to be highlighted to the new\ngeneration who haven\u2019t seen these kinds of diseases. We\nalso need to ensure that vaccines are distributed equally\nto all countries, and the government should reinforce\ncollaborative ideas and coordination.\nRecently, I helped organise an interesting conference\nabout bad microbes and good microbes. With climate\nchange, we are in a situation where a lot of diseases are\non the rise. Fungi that weren\u2019t virulent before are becoming virulent due to optimal temperatures. Diseases\ntransmitted by insects, like Japanese encephalitis from\nmosquitoes, are increasing due to higher humidity lev-els. Some strains of cholera are starting to become pathogenic to humans and no longer just in water. On the\nother hand, there are a lot of good microbes that need\nto be preserved. Our human microbiome, microbes in\nsoil and water, and those that can be used as alternative\nenergy sources are beneficial. The more people are educated and willing to collaborate, the better prepared we\nare as a society.\nQ. Do you have any general advice for students pursuing science? What would you say to women in\nSTEM at Imperial?\nTry to learn as much as possible during these years.\nWhat you\u2019re building now can lead you to think about\nwhere you want to be in the future. I got really passionate about vaccines coming from pharmaceutical chem-istry, and I still apply what I learned intellectually.\nFor women, I think it\u2019s important to positively change\nour attitude. Obviously, society doesn\u2019t help often in\nthat aspect, but women should know and believe that\nthey can truly succeed in anything they want to achieve.\nVaccines prevent the\nacquisition of antibacterial\nresistance because they\nprevent infection itself...\nby vaccinating, you reduce\nantibiotic use and slow down\nantimicrobial resistance.\n\u201c\nProfessor Pizza giving a talk at the 18th\nCongress of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS) this October in Florence, Italy Mariagrazia Pizza\n\n"

The Felix Food\nTeam headed to Hao Chi last week to give\ntheir take on the food.\nAs one enters the JCR from the gate\nfarther from the Sherfield building,\nNeoPizza is on the immediate left,\nKimiko on the right and a short walk\nfrom either brings you to Hao Chi.\nThe first thing that catches one\u2019s eye\nis a bright screen displaying the day\u2019s\nvegetarian and non-vegetarian options,\nalong with an extensive selection of\nsides to complement each meal. On\nWednesday in particular Hao Chi serves\n5 Spiced Chicken Drumsticks, and Tofu\nand Vegetable Stir Fry with the option\nof rice or noodles. Free Asian slaw and\nprawn crackers are also offered on the\nside. The entire meal cost students 6.27\npounds, with the option of two spring\nrolls for only an extra 40 pence.\nAs one stands in the line to place their\norder, it\u2019s hard not to be tempted by\nthe variety of snack options on display,\nincluding millet crisps, seaweed chips,\npudding, and more. After one pays for\ntheir food, there\u2019s also a counter, with\nthe option to top the meal off with extra\nsweet and sour sauce and crispy fried\nonions.\nThenoodleswereastandout;thickand\nperfectly cooked with a chewy texture.\nNo wonder they ran out, and there was\na five minute wait for those! The sweet\nand sour sauce coating added a bright,\ntangy flavour to each bite. The portion\nof chicken drumsticks was good for the\nprice \u2013 adding the all\u2013essential protein\nto the meal. They were well-cooked and\ntender, with crispy skin for those who\nenjoy it.\nFor the vegetarian option, the stir-fry\nwas said to be nice, with a slight umami\nflavour that went well with soft, well\u2013\ncooked and aromatic rice. The green\nbeans and the sprouts in the stir\u2013fry were\ncrunchy, adding a plethora of textures to\nthe meal. The tender tofu was the source\nof protein in the meal.\nAs for the sides, the Asian slaw added\na nice crunch and a refreshing contrast\nto the warm dishes, though it would\u2019ve\ntasted better served even colder. The\nprawn chips also went well with the\nfood \u2013 adding an additional layer of\ncrunch with a subtle sweetness that\ncomplemented the meal. The spring rolls\nwere wonderfully crisp. A member of\nthe Felix Food team found them to be the\nhighlight of the meal.\nOverall, Hao Chi keeps the JCR buzzing\nwithitsmixofboldsauces,crunchysides,\nand well\u2013cooked mains. This spot offers\na satisfying, budget-friendly escape into\nChinese\u2013inspired flavors. Just remember\nto grab those spring rolls \u2013 they might\njust steal the show!

Included in the\nprice of a ticket \u2013 starting at \u00a350 \u2013 was\nlunch and unlimited coffee, with an\nopportunity between breaks to speak to\nfellow students. Although participants\nmay have been disappointed with the\nlack of direct contact with the majority\nof speakers, there were some smaller\ngroup discussions included in the event.\nFor most sessions, students could ask\nspeakersquestionsviaMentimeter,which\nwere then relayed to the moderator. One\nof the students described his experience\nas \u201cvery informative for undergrads to\nget some insights,\u201d and related that he\nhad met \u201cinteresting dudes\u201d.\nWhile the event was billed as a way for\nstudents to learn more about different\ncareer opportunities, where it truly\nexcelled was teaching students about\nearly career management. The attendees\nemphasised that the trait most sought\nacross all financial companies and units\nremained passion and enthusiasm for\nthe given role, which they said should\nalso help applicants decide what is most\nsuited to them. John Madgwick, the early\ncareers managers of the Sa\u00efd Business\nSchool, suggested that being unable to\nconvincingly answer the classic \u201cWhy\nthis company?\u201d was an early sign that\napplicants were misdirected. To get a\nmore holistic view of a given career,\nattendees were also urged to read the\nbiographies of the bigwigs that rose\nthrough it, and research aspects such as\nthe typical work-life balance in addition\nto technical specifics.\nThe panels insisted that applicants\nshould underline any experience \u2013 no\nmatter how distantly related to the role\n\u2013 that demonstrates a commitment\nto hard work and personal ethics.\nRegarding interviews, they reminded\nthe audience that employers are looking\nfor a human being and not the voiceover\nof a spreadsheet: Rui Zhong from BNP\nParibas emphases that a logical answer\nis always better than a memorized one,\nespecially if it is delivered in a warm and\nhumble way.\n\u201cThe students who perform best\nat the beginning and at the end of an\ninternship often aren\u2019t the same,\u201d noted\nSophie Warrick from JP Morgan. While\nhard work, willingness and commitment\nto staying long hours were repeatedly\ncited as the basis to a good attitude in\nan internship, curiosity seemed to stand\nout as the trait differentiating trainees.\nIssie Armstrong from DWS Group also\nsuggested that, in internships and in full-time jobs alike, promotions went to the\nbest networkers and those who \u201cshout\nthe loudest\u201d than to the hardest workers,\nheightening the importance of facetime\nwith managers in the office.\nArtificial intelligence was discussed\nat length during the panel. Both\nArmstrong and Mathieu Marc from\nAtomico agreed in warning that many\nlaborious tasks previously given to\nyoung analysts, such as the analysis\nof long documents, slides, and even\nmodels could soon be outsourced to AI\nat a cheaper cost, and for similar results.\nAccording to them, those who dream of\nbreaking into finance will benefit from\nexcelling where AI can\u2019t \u2013 namely in\nnetworking and persuasion.\nBUSINESS\nUK\u2019s largest student\nfinance event\nlaunches\nBusinessWriter\nGUILLAUME FELIX\nL-to-R: Raluca Rusu (UCL Student), Rui Zhong (BNP Paribas CIB), Platini Kamdem (Adams Street\nPartners), Aravindh Suresh (Macquarie Asset Management)\nThe students who perform best at the\nbeginning and at the end of an internship\noften aren\u2019t the same\n\u201c\nCareer26 brings industry insights to\nstudents exploring finance careers\nBusinessEditor\nALIA FRIEDMAN\n\n"

She desperately\nwants to be liked, and we can feel it.\nIn the second half of the book,\nDederer diverts her focus to women\nlike Sylvia Plath and Doris Lessing,\nwho are examined as \u201cmonstrous\u201d for\nhaving poor mental health or choosing their careers\nover their children.\nThough an honorable\nattempt at producing\na feminist critique of\ndouble standards in art,\nDederer\u2019s comparisons\ndilute the strength of\nher arguments. By what\nstandard does a mother\u2019s\nchoice to prioritize her\ncareer possibly compare\nto acts of abuse?\nThe book\u2019s lack of cogency left me with more\nquestions than I started with. New arguments and\nthemes are constantly introduced but rarely fully\naddressed. To Dederer\u2019s credit, this topic lends itself to a\nvast array of routes to explore. However, her arguments\nfluctuate without a clear sense of direction and are\nexplored with inconsistent depth. It is evident Dederer\nherself can\u2019t\nquite formulate a homogenous\nopinion.\nFinally, Dederer\u2019s conclusion takes a nihilistic turn.\nShe suggests that our choice to boycott art made by\n\u201cmonsters\u201d holds no ethical significance beyond an\nempty gesture. Since it makes no difference, she argues,\nwe might as well continue to engage with such art in any\nway we want. Here, I do not agree with Dederer (though\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind \u2013 she continually disagrees with\nherself).\nInstead, I believe we should approach art with\ncaution,tryingtoseekoutsourcesthatdonotcontribute\nto the profit or legacy of the \u201cmonsters\u201d behind the\nwork. Although achieving perfect consistency might\nbe impossible, our efforts to consume both judiciously\nand responsibly send a message that art is not just a\ncommodity. Art is a reflection of our values and the\npeople we choose to uplift. In the end, it\u2019s not just about\nwhat we consume, but what we stand for when we do.\nBOOKS\nBooksWriter\nNADEEN DAKA\nShe desperately\nwants to be liked, and\nwe can feel it.\n\u201c\nA critical review of Monsters \u2013 not the hit\nNetflix series, but Claire Dederer\u2019s book\nabout what we should do with great art by\nbad people.\nArt, morality, and hollow\nreflections\n\n"

Even taking inflationary measures into account, surely the operational\ncosts of running halls, as well as paying off credit would\nnot amount to some number of rooms having their rents\nraised by more than half (58%). Even if the rooms affected are those in Southside and Eastside, typically hosting\nwealthier, international students, surely even they would\nhave questions as to why their rents are ballooning. If we\napply these calculations to the halls in North Acton, it is\nimpossible to justify raising rents from \u00a3177 to \u00a3280 per\nweek, on top of the required railcard one will need to actually travel to campus. North Acton is not a vibrant student village, I\u2019ve lived there, albeit a few years ago now.\nThe most exciting thing going on in North Acton is the\ndrug dealer who lives above the Tesco\u2019s (not an endorsement of taking drugs) and the trek to Asda through the\ngraveyard. Should rents increase to \u00a3280 per week, this\nwould put the vast majority of rooms in North Acton at\npresumably market rate with a total cost of \u00a310,906.74 on\na 39-week lease, almost \u00a33,340 greater than the cost of an\n\u201caffordable\u201d room\u2013 set by the Mayor of London, this is valued as 55% of the maximum maintenance loan afforded\nto students in London.\nPerhaps the basis of at Imperial College has seen a little\nstatistic reported in The Times, where on average, Imperial students are given \u00a331,700 by their parents \u2013 the highest\nin the UK. I\u2019ve been unable to find the dataset for this, or\nthe methodology of the survey, which was done by High\nFliers, a consultancy firm. There are obvious problems taking this value prima facie. Imperial has a higher percentage of international students, who \u2013 if surveyed \u2013 will most\nlikely have taken at least \u00a312,006 (the minimum maintenance threshold) from their parents, very much bringing\nup the average from those of home students. There\u2019s also\nthe problem of taking the mean, rather than the median\nvalue.\nIt\u2019s no secret that the maintenance loan system is not\nfit for purpose. Even with the generous Imperial bursary, it\nseems to me that many people are still struggling to make\nends meet and are having to encumber themselves with\npart\u2013time work. It\u2019s one thing to work part\u2013time reading\nhistory where you only have eight contact hours, but at\nImperial where most students have eight hours of lectures\nalone, not including labs, seminars, problem classes, and\ntutorials, which is expected to be coupled with the equivalent hours independently working, its beyond unmanage-able. Pursuing these punitive rent increases and helping\nprice out lower income students who don\u2019t have the resources to prevent them from working in London, one of\nthe most expensive cities in Europe, is going to negatively\nimpact both incoming students, and the diversity of the\nstudent body. Students will be put off if they have to pay\nmore than 79% of their maintenance loan towards rent\nin halls, particularly if their peers at UCL, who can spend\n\u00a3268.60 a week (\u00a310,478.91 for a 39 week lease) to live in\nthe worst room in Astor Hall in zone one\u2013 bearing in mind\nthat Astor Hall is the equivalent to Southside or Eastside\nin terms of location and proximity to the main campus.\nSorry White City. Who would want to spend more to live\nin North Acton, which is a glorified industrial estate on the\nborder of zone two and three?\nThe reality is, higher education is a service, then the\namenities that Imperial must provide have to be competitively priced. Students are no longer just students but also\nconsumers. Raising rents in such a way, for whatever rea-son, are just going to turn away the \u201cthe most talented, the\nmost enterprising and the most diverse\u201d\n.\nRent rises are\nrisible\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI Retraction\nOur recent article \u201cOne in five manifestos written using\nAI for Autumn elections\u201d (Felix #1857) did not meet our\neditorial standards.\nAs a result, we will be removing the article from our website and Instagram page.\nThe article will be amended and further work will be done\nto ensure that it upholds the standards of Felix.\nMohammad Majlisi\nEditor\u2013in\u2013Chief\n\n"

Meanwhile, people tend to overlook\nanother equally important threat to human existence: antimicrobial resistance\n(AMR). The problem of AMR arises when\nmicrobes like bacteria and fungi develop resistance through natural selection\nagainst antimicrobial medicines, causing them to spread. In this new collaboration between Felix and Women in SET,\nwe had a chance to interview Professor\nMariagrazia Pizza to talk about her background and efforts to fight AMR using\nvaccines. Prior to joining Imperial, she\nwas Senior Scientific Director Bacterial\nVaccines at GSK and Head of Research\nat GVGH, the GSK Vaccine Institute for\nGlobal Health.\nQ. What did you enjoy most about\nstudying at university? Were there\nany specific topics, projects, or activities that sparked your interest to pursue pharmaceutical design?\nI went to the University of Naples, Italy, to study Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Technologies. For me, I liked that\nthe system in Italy treated university as\na new phase of your life and I really felt\nlike I\u2019d entered a completely new world of\nacademia.\nI knew I wanted to work on drugs and\nsomething that was going to help people.\nI was told that this was the way to go, and\nfortunately, I came to the realisation that\nI really liked it. I was particularly fascinated by the lab work, and the idea that\nyou can see results in a very short time.\nI enjoyed the theoretical part, but I fell in\nlove with the practical aspect.\nIn Italy, we were required to spend at\nleast one year in the lab to work on our\nfinal thesis, in which I looked at peptide\nfolding using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Studying pharmaceutical\nchemistry and working in many different\nlabs at university, I employed my skills in\nworking on structural molecules. However, after completing my thesis success-fully, I wanted to move on and delve into\nthe developing world of molecular biology and genetic engineering. This is why\nI then went to the European Molecular\nBiology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany.\nQ. Your work was instrumental in the\ndevelopment of the meningococcal B\nvaccine using \u201creverse vaccinology\u201d.\nCould you walk us through the challenges and breakthroughs of that pro-ject?\nThis project in particular had many\nbreakthroughs, the main one being that\nbefore \u201creverse vaccinology\u201d, we were\nlooking at one protein at a time. Each\nperson in the lab had their own project.\nWith this new technology using genome\nscreening, we discovered 600 new an-tigens. When working with such a high\nnumber of proteins, you can\u2019t just sit and\nstudy each of them on a molecular lev-el. This was challenging as it completely\nchanged the way we approached science\nin our lab.\nHence, we needed to solve a lot of\nquestions from an antigenic perspective,\nunderstanding what antigens do since\nthey were selected from the genome.\nThese new antigens brought regulatory challenges, in terms of expression in\ndifferent strains, immunogenicity, and\nfunction \u2013 you don\u2019t want toxic molecules used as vaccines.\nAs a lab, it took some time for us to\nappreciate this technology but we soon\nrealised that it could bring something\nspecial into the world of vaccines. Most\nimportantly, I always gained motivation\nfrom the fact that we had been working\nas a team, trusting each other.\nQ. What are your thoughts on antimicrobial resistance and the impact\nof bacterial infections in our modern\nworld? How can vaccines help reduce\nour reliance on antibiotics?\nAMR is a very challenging issue because bacteria can evolve and acquire\nantibiotic resistance genes very quickly.\nCurrently, the pharmaceutical industry is going through a crisis in terms of\nhandling countless failures of new drug\ndiscoveries.

Imperial College London has\nthe chance to contribute to research and\ninnovation, showcasing climate solu-tions. Together, these players reflect the\nwide-reaching impact and collaborative\npotential of COP29.\nHow does Azerbaijan balance\nfossil fuels and climate goals?\nAzerbaijan is at a pivotal moment as it\nseeks to balance its fossil-fuel-driven\neconomy with clean sources. Despite\ncommitting to a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by\n2050, Azerbaijan continues to serve as a\nmajor oil and gas exporter. Meeting European demand, Azerbaijan plans to double\nits gas exports to the EU: a shift that aligns\nwith energy security goals but underscores its reliance on fossil fuels even as\noil exports have gradually decreased over\nthe past seven years.\nAzerbaijan\u2019s renewable energy initiatives are gaining traction, particularly\nthrough projects with foreign investors,\nsuch as solar, offshore and onshore wind\nprojects with the Masdar and ACWA\nPower. Yet, this transition is hampered\nby infrastructure and supply chain lim-itations. The country\u2019s renewable sector\nis constrained by logistical costs and limited domestic experience, making solar\nprojects more feasible than wind due to\nsimpler transportation and setup. However, the country has a plan to establish a\ngreen interconnector linking Azerbaijan\nto Hungary via the Black Sea for renewable electricity.\nAzerbaijan recognizes the need for significant legislative and economic adjustments to address these challenges. For\nexample, laws are under review to allow\nthird-party access to the national grid,\na crucial step in opening the renewable\nenergy market. Alongside these changes,\nthe government has introduced tax and\ncustoms incentives to encourage renewable projects, signalling its dedication to\nfostering sustainable energy infrastruc-ture.\nDuring COP29, Azerbaijan will advocate for accessible climate finance to help\nenergy-producing nations like itself transition to cleaner energy. This crucial role\nhighlights both the challenges and opportunities faced by resource-rich countries\nstriving to align their economies with a\nsustainable, low-carbon future.\nWill the UK step up its climate\ncommitments?\nFor the UK, COP29 comes at a critical time\nfor global political security. As the world\nfaces intensifying geopolitical tensions,\nthe UK is prioritising its own security by\nramping up renewable energy and decar-bonisation to reduce reliance on fossil\nfuels. This shift aligns with the UK\u2019s 2050\nnet-zero target.\nAmid a wave of absences among global\nleaders \u2013 Ursula von der Leyen of the EU\nCommission, Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz, and\nFrance\u2019s Emmanuel Macron \u2013 PM Keir\nStarmer is one of a dwindling number of\nleaders of major industrialized economies\nattending COP29. Starmer\u2019s presence reinforces the UK\u2019s commitment and positions it to lead negotiations on behalf of\ndeveloped nations. Starmer is expected to\nannounce ambitious new climate targets\nfor the UK and renew the country\u2019s \u00a311.6\nbillion pledge in climate finance for poorer countries. The UK will also push for establishing the NCQG to ensure transparency and accountability in global climate\nfinancing, underscoring its leadership\nrole in pursuing equitable, actionable climate commitments at COP29.\nWhat role does Imperial play\nin the summit?\nImperial College London will have a delegation at COP29, showcasing its leadership in climate change, sustainable\ninnovation, and youth-led action. Alongside its 2040 net-zero target, Imperial\nhas a chance to highlight its Zero Index\nframework, which tracks if companies\nit\u2019s invested in are Paris-aligned. Imperial will also spotlight the role of the insurance industry in unlocking capital for\nclimate and financing the energy transition in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Additionally, Imperial will\nfocus on the impacts of climate change\non mental health, advocating for more\nyouth-driven, interdisciplinary approaches to climate action. These contributions\nwill underscore Imperial\u2019s commitment\nto both global and local collaboration and\nscience-based actionable solutions for the\nclimate crisis.\nWill COP29 pave the way for a\ntruly sustainable future?\nAs COP29 progresses, all eyes will be on\nthe critical financial conversations that\nwill shape the future of climate action.\nAt the heart of this year\u2019s summit is the\nNCQG, which aims to bring greater transparency and accessibility to climate fi-nance, with a focus on the needs of the\nworld\u2019s most vulnerable nations. The expansion of the Loss and Damage Fund,\nestablished at COP28, will also take centre stage for countries hit hardest by cli-mate-induced disasters. However, these\nfinancial commitments need to be more\nthan promises: they must be backed by\nreal support, particularly as the scale of\nclimate impacts grows.\nTheurgencyfordecisiveactionhasnever been clearer. Scientists report unprecedented warming, with record surface and\nocean temperatures, dangerously high\nlevels of carbon dioxide and methane, and\na continued rise in fossil fuel production.\nJustsixmonthsafterCOP28,theworldsuffered $41 billion in damages from extreme\nweather events. As COP29 begins, the\ninternational community must take real\nsteps to reverse these destructive trends,\nor risk deepening global instability.\nAzerbaijan\u2019s presidency of COP29 offers a unique opportunity to lead the global shift from fossil fuel dependence to a\nsustainable future. Yet, the country faces\nits own dilemma: its economy remains\ndeeply reliant on oil and gas, a challenge\nfaced by other recent petro-state COP\nhosts, such as the UAE and Egypt. This\ntension will likely rise as debates continue over how quickly, and to what extent,\nfossil fuels should be phased out. With a\nshift in energy priorities, COP29 will likely\nrecharge the discussions surrounding fossil fuel transitions, potentially sparking\ncontroversy over the pace of change.\nIn addition to the climate debate, ongoing global conflicts, from the Middle East\nto Ukraine, pose significant challenges\nfor international cooperation. Trust between nations is essential to achieving\nmeaningful progress at COP29, and the\nsummit\u2019s proposal for a global ceasefire,\nor \u2018Truce COP,\u2019 reflects the growing recognition that peace and climate action must\ngo hand in hand. This unprecedented call\nfor a unified pause in conflict highlights\nhow closely climate issues are intertwined\nwith geopolitical stability.\nFinally, COP29 could solve long-stand-ing issues with Article 6, which has held\nback progress on international carbon\nmarkets for nearly a decade. A breakthrough here could lead to more investment in carbon trading by creating a\nbetter system for reducing emissions and\ntackling greenwashing. If successful, this\ncould become a vital tool in the global effort to fight climate change.\nAs COP29 comes to an end, the world\nwill be watching to see if this summit can\nprovide the financial support, political\nwill, and global cooperation needed for a\nsustainable future. The decisions made in\nBaku could determine whether we move\ntowardamoreresilientandfairerworldor\nrisklosingthenarrativeneededtoprevent\nthe worst impacts of climate change.\nThis article was written before COP29 be-gan.\nVolume of crude oil exported (in million metric tons of oil equivalent) from Azerbaijan.

The agreement\nset two ambitious targets: to keep global\ntemperature rise \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C above\npre-industrial levels\u201d and to make every\neffort to limit the increase to 1.5\u00b0C; and to\nreach these targets, to peak greenhouse\ngas(GHG)emissionsby2025anddecrease\nby 43% by 2030.\nThe Paris Agreement established\na 5-year cycle of climate action. Every\nfive years, countries must reassess and\nstrengthen their climate commitments\nin what is known as \u2019ratcheting up\u2019 am-bitions. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are mandatory climate\naction plans submitted by each country\nto demonstrate their goals and the steps\nthey\u2019ll take to meet them. Countries started submitting NDCs in 2020, and they will\nsubmit updated plans in 2025 at COP30.\nAdditionally, countries can submit optional Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas\nEmission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) for broader, long-term planning,\nthough these are not mandatory.\nEach COP builds on the outcomes\nof previous sessions. In 2023, ahead of\nCOP28, the first ever global stocktake was\npublished. It is a comprehensive report\nassessing the collective progress of all\nnations under the Paris Agreement. This\nprogress report set the stage for COP29,\nwhere countries will review their financing needs before the submission of new\nNDCsatCOP30in2025.Asaresult,COP29\nholds a critical position in evaluating\nwhether our current ambitions align with\nglobal targets for emissions reductions.\nAs COP29 approaches, hosted this year\nin Baku, Azerbaijan, the world is watching\nto see how what actionable policies will\nemerge. With increasing climate disasters\nand economic pressures, COP29 will play a\ncritical role in addressing gaps in previous\nagreements and pushing forward bolder,\nmeasurable commitments to reduce emissions and support vulnerable nations.\nWhat are the main themes and\nexpectations for COP29?\nWith the motto \u201cIn Solidarity for a Green\nWorld\u201d, COP29 aims to bring global cooperation and urgency to Baku. The COP29\nPresidency\u2019s plan revolves around two\nmain pillars: to enhance ambition, it em-phasisestheneedforcountriestoincrease\ntheir climate targets and transparency;\nand to enable action, it focuses on mobi-lising finance to convert these ambitions\ninto concrete steps for emissions reduc-tion, adaptation, and addressing loss and\ndamage.\nWithin those statements, three key\nthemes of climate summit can be high-lighted:\n(1) To align with the Paris Agreement\u2019s\ntemperature targets, COP29 will call for\nstronger national commitments to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions. This year\u2019s\ndiscussions will explore how sustainable\ndevelopment, like adopting circular economic models, can support mitigation ef-forts. Increasing the availability of global\ncapital for adaptation and mitigation is\nalso essential. Talks will emphasise removing barriers in public funding and\nsending clearer signals to investors, encouraging an international approach to\nlow-cost, effective mitigation options to\nkeep the 1.5\u00b0C target within reach.\n(2) One of the most anticipated topics\nat COP29, or the \u2018money COP\u2019, is finance.\nFinance is central to negotiations as countries push for the establishment of a New\nCollective Quantified Goal (NCQG) for climate funding before 2025. This new goal\nwill likely replace the unmet $100 billion\nannual climate finance commitment\nfrom developed economies. COP29 will\nalso look to increase the recently established Loss and Damage Fund to support\nnations experiencing severe climate im-pacts. Progress on\nthe goal to double\nclimate finance\nby 2025, a target\nset at COP26, will\nbe reviewed, with\na new Climate\nFinance Action\nFund proposed to\nsupport developing countries as\nmain resources in\nfood and agriculture.\n(3) COP29 will focus on advancing renewable energy, increasing efficiency, and\nphasing down fossil fuel use. Commitments made at previous COPs include tripling renewable energy use by 2030, doubling energy efficiency improvements,\nand reducing fossil fuel dependence.\nHowever, the shift away from hydrocarbons is currently made more difficult by\nhigh demand, economic reliance on fossil\nfuels, and energy security.\nBolstered by significant growth in renewable energy, environmental activists\nwill likely push for a more accelerated fossil fuel phase-out.\nAzerbaijan has proposed a Climate\nAction Finance Fund to raise $1 billion\nfrom fossil fuel producers to support the\nenergy transition, aiming to tie fossil fuel\nfinancing with sustainable change. The\noutcomes of these discussions have the\npossibility to shape the pace and equity of\nthe global energy transition.\nWhat could COP29 mean for\nkey players?\nCOP29 brings together diverse stakehold-ers. For Azerbaijan, hosting COP29 is a\nchance to advocate for climate finance\nthat supports energy transitions in de-ENVIRONMENT\nCOP29 in Azerbaijan\nEnvironmentWriter\nELDAR ALIYEV\nCan this summit help shape a sustainable future?\nShare of electricity generation from fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear glob-ally.

Earlier this year we saw the acquisition\nof Credit Suisse by UBS, and Nationwide\u2019s acquisition\nof Virgin Money this October. This article looks into the\ndriving forces and obstacles behind commercial and\ninvestment bank consolidation in Europe, and possible\nimplications for consumers. As Hyder Jumabhoy of\nWhite & Case states, \u201cWe are more bullish on bank\nM&A than we have been in the last 5 years \u2026 European\nlenders which had shelved transformational deals will\nneed to act quickly, albeit carefully.\u201d\nThe fundamental drive for possible consolidation\nin the European banking sector is benefits from scale.\nLarger institutions tend to be more efficient than their\nsmaller peers. This sort of efficiency may outweigh the\nincreased risk a larger bank may take on. Considering\nthat the role of a commercial bank is to match savers\nwith excess savings to borrowers that seek loans means\nlargerbankscanmatchthemmoreefficiently,leveraging\nupon their wider geographic reach.\nAccording to the ECB Banking Supervision there\nare longstanding issues such as low profitability and\ncapacity in the European Banking Sector. The case\nof consolidation, be it cross-border or within the EU,\nwould help ease the burden of a costly regulatory\nsystem for each bank. By achieving greater economies\nof scale, European banks could rival US and Chinese\ncounterparts in terms of lending capacity, profitability,\nand technology. In terms of investment banks, recently,\nwe have also seen a trend toward faster settlement\nwindows for securities, already adopted by markets like\nthe US and Canada which further underscores the need\nfor European banks to consolidate and modernise.\nHowever, cross-border bank consolidation in Europe\nremains a contentious issue, mainly due to the region\u2019s\nfragmented regulatory landscape. Different countries\nhave different tax regimes, labour laws, and financial\nregulations, which complicate mergers that span\nnational borders. \u201cHurdles to deals include banking\nregulations and broader fragmentation of rules across\nEurope such as lack of tax and product harmonisation,\u201d\nNicolas Charnay, managing director at S&P Global\nRatings illustrates. \u201cThis makes it hard to generate\neconomies of scale and therefore find economic sense\nin cross-border deals.\u201d\nIt is important to note that the topic of consolidation\nand whether bigger banks may benefit consumers as\nmuch as they benefit the banks still falls under debate.\nIt is also possible that as banks grow large, they become\nmore complicated to run in practice due to the cultural\nand operational integration of the merged entities that\nneed to be addressed. There are real costs to increases\nin bank size, and they may not be able to attract more\ndepositsaswouldbehoped.Asaresult,wecouldwitness\nincreased costs for both consumers and enterprises.\nPerhaps without the political will to break down\nregulatory barriers and create\na unified financial framework,\ncross-border mergers may\ncontinue to face obstacles,\nlimiting the full potential of\nconsolidation in Europe.\nEuropean banks head to\nconsolidation\nBusinessWriter\nNIKITA KARRI\nWhy European\ncommercial and\ninvestment banks are\nconsolidating and its\nimpact on global markets\nBank.

His continuing\ninfluence on British theatre\nalone is superlative \u2013 since\n1996, there have been 778 UK\nproductions of Romeo and Juliet,\n1,010 of Macbeth, 472 of Hamlet,\nnot counting the plethora of\nopera, ballet, films, and other\nplays derived from these.\nHowever this raises a potential\nproblem. The challenge for the\ntheatre director leading the\nproduction of an existing play\nis to find a new interpretation\nto explore and emphasise,\noftentimes the characters and\nthe relationships between\nthem. Yet there are only so\nmany novel interpretations\nthat one can come up with;\nthe audience of today probably\nwon\u2019t find productions faithful\nto the source material terribly\nengaging anyway.\nSome newer productions\naddress this by updating the\nplay\u2019s sets and characters.\nGrand Theft Hamlet (2024)\naddresses this by throwing\nout the sets, the stage, and\nthe entire theatre altogether.\nThe movie, directed by Sam\nCrane and Pinny Grylls during\nthe 2021 COVID-19 lockdown,\ncaptures the preparation and\nrehearsal of a rendition of\nHamlet, performed completely\ninside the titular game. Here,\nthe more urgent challenge\nfor \u201ctheatre\u201d directors Crane\nand Mark Oosterveen was\nthe logistics of performing a\nplay in a medium where most\nplayers act like crazed domestic\nterrorists; they would rather\nmow down in cold blood than\njoin a virtual acting troupe.\nWhile on the run from the\ncops following an execution\nin broad daylight \u2013 which I\ngather isn\u2019t too uncommon\nan occurrence in GTA \u2013 their\nin-game avatars encounter\nan open-air theatre, where\nthey take turns performing\nShakespearean soliloquies to\nrows of empty seats. In this\nmoment an idea is born: the\npandemic might have put their\nday jobs as actors on hiatus,\nbut it couldn\u2019t hope to infiltrate\nvirtual, violence-afflicted Los\nSantos\u2013aperfectplace,then,for\na lockdown play. The audition\nbrings a host of other personas,\nsome belonging to other real-life actors facing similar career\nproblems. With each successive\nrehearsal, what at first seemed\nabsurd and gimmicky begins\nto look more and more like a\nserious production.\nBut the real world, ever the\nenemy of escapism, rears its\nugly head. As most of their cast\nbecome preoccupied elsewhere\nand are thus less available, the\ntight-knit social network begins\ndisintegrating. For Oosterveen,\nwho earlier dropped the\nheartbreaking bombshell that\nCult classics from theatre and gaming combine\nin an unlikely partnership. The result is a\ngenuinely sidesplitting comedy \u2013 and a sobering\ndocumentary about socialisation during lockdown.\nGrand Theft\nHamlet\nFILM&TV he has recently been bereaved\nand has no one in person he can\nget through lockdown with, the\nprospect of losing these precious\nsocial connections is nothing\nshort of terrifying. Crane\u2019s own\nobsession with the project \u2013\nonline into the wee hours of\nthe morning \u2013 drives a wedge\nin his relationship with Grylls,\nwhose resentment creeps into\nthe documentary. When their\nlead actor gets a job and can no\nlonger commit to the main role,\nCrane and Oosterveen introspect\nabout the utility of their acting\ncareers in contrast with \u201creal\njobs\u201d. To make things gloomier,\npitching their show to several\ntheatre companies yields exactly\nzero replies in return. These\ninterjections of the documentary\nmakers\u2019ownstruggles,indicative\nof the contextual background\nof the movie, allow GTH to\ntranscend merely being 90\nminutes of two blokes messing\naround on a livestream.\nAs H-Hour approaches and\nthe pressure continues to pile\non, Crane \u2013 the stand-in actor for\nHamlet \u2013 begins contemplating\nthe fundamental question\nposed in the play\u2019s, perhaps even\nShakespeare\u2019s most famous\nsoliloquy. Existing means to\ngo on suffering \u201cthe slings and\narrows of outrageous fortune\u201d: a\nplay not getting the attention it\ndeserves; actors dropping major\nroles; not being there for a loved\none, or having no loved ones\nthere for you; strafe-bombed by\n\u201cxXx_epicgamer69_xXx\u201d while\nthe prepubescent runt screams\nracial slurs at you. In that case,\ndoes non-existence, ending \u201cthe\nheart-ache and the thousand\nnatural shocks/ That flesh is heir\nto\u201d, not seem more preferable?\nI don\u2019t have an answer to this.\nI suspect Crane doesn\u2019t either.\nInstead, he commits to the role,\nand to the job to which he has\ndevoted his life, breaking out of\nhis solipsistic self-confinement\nand re-connecting with the rest\nof the cast ahead of the final\nperformance. Organising a play\nin a medium as limited as a video\ngame is certainly a miracle, but\nGrand Theft Hamlet is really a\ncelebrationof social connections\nenduring in times when they\nare hardest to maintain \u2013 yet are\nneeded the most.\nWhatwearelooking\nforwardto\nThree Kilometres to\nthe End of the World\nDirector: Emanuel P\u00e2rvu (Better This Way)\nRuntime: 105 min\nA tale all too depressingly common. If\nbeing the victim of a homophobic attack\nwasn\u2019t bad enough for Romanian teenager\nAdi, the assault reveals his sexuality to\nthe rest of the community. Cue the usual\nvictim-blaming, police cover-ups, and a\nbizarre attempt to exorcise the gay out of\nhim, courtesy of his own mother.\nThe prospect of\nlosing precious\nsocialconnections\nis nothing short of\nterrifying\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "15 November 2024 Imperial's Student Newspaper\nOT Interviews: Nico Henry,\nDeputy President (Welfare)\nFelix interviews Nico about his ambitious year full of promises and what\nit\u2019s like to work as an Officer Trustee as someone who hasn\u2019t historically\nengaged with IC Union\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nN\nico Henry was never someone who\nwas engaged with the Union during\nhis time as an undergrad, he \u201cdidn\u2019t\nhave any roles\u201d on a Club or Society Committee, and he \u201cwasn\u2019t involved in any\nsocieties\u201d. But during third year, as he\nwrote his dissertation, Nico decided to\nrun for Deputy President (Welfare). \u201cI realized I chose physics because I wanted to\nkind of create an impact with the work I\ndo,\u201d he says on our call. \u201cBut then I realized I was doing my dissertation on calibrating neutrino detectors, and by the\nend of it by after spending hours\u2013 many,\nmany days in a dark lab with no lights. I\nthought you know what? I might as well\nwork somewhere else doing something\nelse, and I thought what would be the job\nthat would give me that I\u2019d have the most\npositive impact with.\u201d\nI started my undergraduate studies\nin the same cohort as Nico, however, we\ndidn\u2019t interact much during our studies,\nif at all. I understood the feeling he de-scribed.\nNico ran a very grassroots campaign:\n\u201cI walked around campus, and I spoke\nwith absolutely everyone I saw.\u201d He wanted to lead a campaign focussed on what\nstudents wanted, and he would ask students \u201cIs there anything that you\u2019d like to\nsee? And what do you think of my ideas?\u201d\nNico spent time on the different cam-puses, trying to gain a broad understanding of the different needs of students by\n\u201cjust speaking with absolutely everyone.\u201d\nThis year Nico intends to get a lot\ndone. He has seven manifesto promises,\nand work is underway on all the projects\nhe intends to do. His aims include:\n\u2022 Continue working on fostering a\nwelcoming environment, facilitate more recreational spaces, and\nenhance communication between\nstudents and the union.\n\u2022 Implement the mental health\nstrategy, continuing the work\ndone by my predecessor and the\nMental Health Officer.\n\u2022 Develop a platform to redistribute surplus food across campus,\naddressing both the cost-of-living\ncrisis and food waste.\n\u2022 Expand mentorship programs\nconnecting underrepresented students with alumni.\n\u2022 Host more inclusive activities\nwith societies, making it easier for\nstudents to meet people and participate in union-hosted events.\n\u2022 Be an accessible and supportive\nrepresentative, keeping my ears\nopen to student feedback and new\ninitiatives.\n\u2022 Improving cycling accessibility.\nThis is a lot. I ask him how he can\nmanage doing everything, or as much as\nhe can in the year he has. \u201cSo I first prioritized ones that depended on other peo-ple. So the food one\nthe events one, the mental health\nstrategy one. Basically, I prioritise those\nbecause I know that right now if it was\naround to me, I would have published\nthe app already. I do the task that will require someone else to complete and then\nI work on my other projects.\u201d He also\nstays \u201clate\u201d at times. It ties into his goal of\n\u201cbeing an accessible and supportive representative\u201d: \u201cThe way I see it is this job is\na job of service.\nA lot of people will see a pyramid, I see\nupside down and I see as everyone keeps\neverything going and then if issues hap-pen, they funnel down and then they end\nup on me.\nI got voted in, I should be held ac-countable, and I love the fact that many\nstudents are coming up to me and asking\nme about my personal projects.\u201d\nOn the projects, there is progress being made. On the topic of more recreational spaces Nico said \u201cThe university\ndoes seem quite keen on creating more\nspaces. We\u2019re doing quite a lot on biodiversity spaces, so we\u2019re looking at spaces\nthat aren\u2019t being used.\nThe students don\u2019t really know about\nand kind of trying to make that more\npublic and letting students have a say\non what goes on.\u201d His goal ties in with IC\nUnion President Camille\u2019s goal of more\ngreen spaces across Imperial\u2019s campuses.\nOn mental health, Nico is also working on implemented the mental health\nstrategy. Part of this is the introduction\nof wellbeing advisors \u201cin every department.\u201d He is also involved in working\non\u201d the report and support tool, my role\nin the Union is to hold the university accountable and make sure that they are\ndoing this.\u201d\nOne of Nico\u2019s most interesting goals is\nhis work on reducing food waste on cam-pus. \u201cI kind of got inspired by Too Good to\nGo.\u201d Too Good to Go is an app that allows\ncustomers to buy food from shops that\nwould otherwise be thrown out or wast-ed. He continues \u201cI was at an event once\nand there were 20 pizzas that were left.\nI\u2019ve worked at a restaurant, and I\u2019ve seen\nfood go to waste and I just hate seeing\nfood go to waste. So, I\u2019m walking around\ncampus, and I thought, you know what,\nI\u2019m just going to give these pizzas away.\nStudents are super happy, and I thought\nwait, why aren\u2019t we doing this on a like a\nproper platform?\n\u201cSome of the private food outlets have\nsaid they\u2019re happy to do it, so it\u2019s slowly\nprogressing. Obviously, nothing set in\nstone and there\u2019s no minimum viable\nproduct yet.\nBut I think it is still possible.\u201d\nNico Henry Imperial College Union\n\n"

They were\naiming to become the first club since Sunderland in\n1891\u201392 season to have a flawless season at home. After\nJay Rodriguez cancelled out an LFC opener, the referee\nseemed to disregard multiple poor challenges against\nLiverpool.\n\u201cThis does not look good for the PGMOL\u201d\nThis was not the only poor set of\ndecisions made by Coote that influenced\nLiverpool\u2019s seasons. In the following season he did not\ngive a red card to Everton\u2019s Jordan Pickford following a\nserious challenge resulting in a torn ACL for Liverpool\u2019s\nVirgil Van Djik. In 2021-22 he did not give an obvious\nhandball against Manchester City\u2019s Rodri which would\nhave resulted in a penalty and possible dropped points\nfor the team \u2013 a title-deciding decicision \u2013 as City\nfinished only a point above Liverpool that year. The\nseason after that, he was officiating Liverpool\u2019s 2-2 draw\nwith Arsenal where linesman Constantine Hatzidakis\nelbowedLiverpoolleftbackAndyRobertson.Herecently\nrefereed Liverpool\u2019s 2-0 win against Aston Villa, where\nLeon Bailey should have been sent off for pulling down\nforward Mo Salah in a goalscoring position.\nAs usual, and as we have come to expect, this does not\nlook good for the PGMOL. They are losing their ability\nto convince the league they are reliable, honest, and\nunbiased. Not just for LFC \u2013 for all teams.\nAfter initial denial, Coote acknowledged the reality\nof the video, making no further comment. The PGMOL\nhave made no comment aside from announcing Coote\u2019s\nsuspension and pending investigation.\nAt least one player escaped criticism.
