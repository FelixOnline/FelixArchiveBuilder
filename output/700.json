    "content": "CFELIX;\nCollege Refectory Supremo Victor Mooney is retiring in May\nafter over 30 years in his position. Although his cuisine is widely\nregarded as inedible by many students and even staff, his\nstature as gourmet, chef, bon vive ur and wit is immense.\nBearing this in mind, FELIX decided to find out some of the\nculinary secrets of the old master.\nFELIX: Mr Mooney, before you retire, are there any secrets\nrecipes that you would like to pass on to students?\nMOONEY Well, when I was a lad, there was one very nutritious\ningredient that everybody used, though it seems to be largely\nforgotten now...perhaps you could call that a secret...I'm talking\nabout tadpoles of courses...\nFELIX Tadpoles! You've got to be joking!\nMOONEY: I thought you'd say that, but then you young people\njust don't know what it was like, in the wars for instance...Of\ncourse, the thing with tadpoles is the season is very short, round\nabout now as a matter of fact. You've got to use young tadpoles,\nthe jet black wriggly kind. The older they get, the tougher they\nare, and then you know, they turn into frogs and they're useless\nfor anything except frogs' legs. You're best to catch them\nyourself naturally, in a pond or perhaps the Serpentine, and just\nkeep them in a jam jar till you need them. And of course, the best\nthing for you poor students is, they're free'.\nFELIX Isn't this tadpole cuisine a bit cruel?\nMOONEY: No, I wouldn't say that. You just look at how many\ntadpoles a frog produces\u2014If they all grew up into frogs we'd be\nup to our eyes in 'em and that would never do, well I suppose we\ncould serve them to the French. No you'll see, I 'll give you some\nrecipes and then you'll understand. Delicious!\nMr Mooney then went on to give recipes for a complete\ndinner, all based on this unique ingredient.\nAvocado Cribbage Surprise\n3 ripe avocadoes\nsmall green pepper\nsmall red pepper\n4 oz mushrooms\ntadpoles to taste (when out of season, use sultanas)\nOlive oil\nWhite wine vinegar\ngarlic\nserves 6\nFinely chop 'he peppers and mushrooms. Place equal\nquantities of oil and vinegar with a finely minced clove of garlic\nin a screw-top jar and shake well. Dress chopped vegetables in\nthis vinaigrette, and then carefully fold in tadpoles.\nCut avocados in half and remove stones. Spoon mixture into\nthe holes. Chill and serve.\nTadpole Quiche\n4 eggs\n4 oz Cheddar cheese, grated\n1\n/4 pt milk\n1\n2 lb mushrooms, chopped\n4 oz tadpoles, (replace with more mushrooms when out of\n10\nseason)\n1 pk t frozen pastry\nsalt and pepper\nBeat the eggs, add the milk and cheese and combine\nthoroughly. Add salt and black pepper and the mushrooms and\ntadpoles.\nRoil out the pastry and line medium sized flan dish with it.\nPour in the filling and bake in a moderate oven for 20\u201430\nminutes until firm and golden.\nBanana and Tadpole Risotto\n1\n/2 onion\n3 mugs brown rice\n2 bananas\n4 oz tadpoles, (replace with sultanas when out of season)\nWalnut pieces to garnish\nolive oil\nserves 6\nPlace the rice in a large pan, cover with water and swish it\naround. Pour off the cloudy water, continue washing the rice in\nthis way until the water remains clear. Pour the rice on to a clean\ncloth on top of some layers of paper to drain. Meanwhile chop\nthe onion and fry in oil in a large pan. Add the rice and fry for a couple of minutes, coating all the grains. Add 6 mugs of cold\nwater, bring to the boil and simmer, covered, until all water has\nbeen absorbed (usually 30\u201440 minutes). Gently mix in slices of\nbanana, walnuts and tadpoles.\nBlackcurrant and Tadpole Sorbet\n8 oz frozen blackcurrants\n2 egg whites\n1 tablespoon tadpoles\n4 oz white sugar\nlemon juice\nBoil the sugar in one cup of water for ten minutes and leave to\ncool. Boil the blackcurrants for ten minutes in a little water and\npass through a sieve. Mix the syrup, fruit and lemon juice to\ntaste. Pour mixture into a freezer container and freeze till just\nfirm. (1\u20142 hours). Whisk the egg whites until stiff, fold gently in\nto the mixture and mix in thoroughly. Now add the tadpoles\ncarefully and make sure they are evenly distributed. Freeze for a further 2 hours.\nMr Mooney says 'This is a wonderfully tasty and nutritious\ndessert'. Allow the sorbet to thaw just a little before serving. If\nyou're lucky, some of the tadpoles revive and start to wriggle\naround in the sorbet. Delicious!\nTo finish: Grenouille Marnier, a French liqueur based on\noranges and tadpoles, and coffee.\nAnd then FELIX asked the burning question which has been\non every student's mind for decades...the secret of Sole\nMooniere (coelacanth and chips), the fish dish first introduced\ninto the refectory repertoire by Mr Mooney and since copied in\nuniversities and colleges throughout Britain. Mr Mooney was at\nfirst reluctant to reveal the secret of this famous creation, but\nafter be ng reminded that the method could be lost forever, he\ncomplied.\nMOONEY It'se sent i al tc start with fresh fish, which hasn't been\nfilleted or skinned, otherwise the dish will be ruined. Obviously\nthe first step is to skin and fillet the fish yourself. Use a sharp\nknife and it's not as difficult as it sounds. Discard the flesh, and\nwrap the rest in a square of cardboard about 6\" square.\n(Cardboard is very rich in fibre, that's why I use it in many of my\ndishes). Finally, dip it in the batter and deep fry until it's quite\nhard. It keeps for days.\nFELIX Why do you think this dish is so popular?\nMOONEY: Well, it's got bones, which are full of calcium, it's got\nskin, and we all know that all the goodness is in the skin. And, as\nI 've said, it's gc' ':\nbre. Finally, there's next to no meat in it. That\nshould please ail the health freaks! And whatever you do, don't spoil it with chips, you students eat far more chips than are good\ncontinued on page 94\nFELIX\nWednesday 20 March 1985\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX.\nFELIX\nThe Lunatics have\ntaken over the\nAsylum\nThe results of the elections for President, DP and Hon Sec don't exactly fill me with\noptimism for next year. Carl has had\nexperience on Union committees, but his\ncontributions, though often amusing, have\nrarely shown real understanding of the issues\nat stake. He has been content to allow his\nwitty manner to hide his ignorance.\nCarl may find that this works with Union\ncommittees, and he may even be able to bluff\nhis way though Council next year. But where\nhe will come unstuck will be in College\ncommittees, dealing with professional\nadministrators. They are unlikely to find his\njokes funny, and they are unlikely to be\nfooled into thinking that he understands the\nissues involved. The importance of Union\nrepresentation on College comit tees should\nnot be underestimated. At the moment the\nUnion's voice is respected by College and\ndoes influence decision making. It would be a tragedy to lose that influence.\nAsk students to place their favourite\nactivities in rank order, and it is unlikely that\nattending lectures would be placed very\nhighly. Even among students who have a genuine liking for their subject, lectures are\nnotoriously unpopular.\nThis is in no small part due to the pathetic\nstandard of lecturing at IC. Some lecturers\nfail at the most ba\"sic level: they keep their\nbacks to the audience and can't be heard.\nAt the next level of failure the lecturer\nrealises that he can't be heard and so writes\nout his notes and duplicates them. He uses a special sort of photocopier which leaves the\nfirst word off each line. This is to ensure that\nthe students still turn up so that they can fill\nin the missing words as the lecturer reads out\nthe_ notes.\nNext comes the modern, trendy lecturer\n' full of new ideas about audio-visual aids (Is\nthis a nasty disease peculiar to lectures?). He\nuses an overhead projector. His techniques is\nthe same as the last lecturer except that you\ncan watch him following his notes with a pointer on the overheard projector as he\nreads them out.\nWhat the College needs is somebody to\nteach the lecturers how to teach.\nDave Parry has made an error of judgement\nin even provisionally accepting a Union\nestimate that is 20% higher than what we are\nlikely to get.\nEvery club submits an estimate of\nexpenditure for the coming year. The DP and\nUnion Finance Committee add up the totals\nfor all the clubs. If the total comes to\nsignificantly more than that the previous year\nthen questions have to be asked. If the\nincrease is reflected in an improved range of\nfacilities then the College look on it quite\nsympathetically when deciding on our\nsub vent ion. But if the increase is simply due\nto over-claiming by certain clubs then it\nshould be dealt with before college even see\nthe estimates.\nThis has just not been done. And by the\ntime college come back and say 'No you can't have a massive increase on last year for no\ngood reason' it will be too late for DaveParry or UFC to decide how to spread the cut\nfairly. We will see another blanket cut. This\nmeans that clubs with realistic estimates will\nbe penal is ed while clubs with inflated\nestimates will be sitting pretty.\nThe DP has actually encouraged over\nclaiming.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Hugh,\nHugh, Grenville, Martin, Dave, John, Diane,\nJon, Pete, Ed, Luke, Tinker, Finian,\nAbsorbance, Pete, Nigel, Chris, Alan, Judith,\nFarah, all the colla tors and Rosemary and\nTony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperia.\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7.\nTelephone 01-589 5111 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1985.

Dave Parry\ncertainly takes his responsibilities seriously.\nWhile duty officer at the Centenary Carnival\nDave was found being discreet and\nunavoidable on the floor in the Table Tennis\nroom! Since then, those in the know have\nonly had to say 'Ping Pong' in order to silence\nMr Parry when he begins to get tiresome\nabout the estimates.\nThere was much celebration after the\nannouncement of the sabbatical election\nresults last week. Hugh Southey telephoned\nhis mum to tell her the good news. Mrs\nSouthey, obviously aware that young Hugh\nwould be spending the rest of the evening\ndrinking until he feel over, immediately\nadvised 'Take your contact le rises out now V. Later, shortly before he fell over, Hugh paid a gentleman from R CSU for next year's sabbaticals to be flan ned, without realising\nthat this would include himself.\nCarl Burgess won't be receiving the same\ndeferential service at the Kwality Tandoori\nthat Ian Bull has enjoyed. The red carpet is\nrolled out for Ian, who the waiters refer to as\n'President\u2014sahib'. Unfortunately Carl was\nrefused entry recently because on a previous\noccasion he removed a cruet set and a vase\nwhen he left. He was eventually let in after\npromising he would return the 'borrowed'\nitems.\nReturning home by coach after a party at\nSilwood last year Carl boarded the vehicle,\nsomewhat inebriated (in fact, completely\npissed), carrying two beer glasses, one part\nfull and one empty. A short time into the\njourney the empty glass also became part full,\nafter a process which commonly follows a lot\nof drinking. Unfortunately Carl's senses were\na little befuddled and he forgot the\ndistinction between the contents of the two\nglasses, with the result that when the coach\narrived back at South Ken both glasses were\nempty, which doesn't say much for the\nquality of the beer at Silwood!\nGraham Brown, chairman of IC Conservative society is pictured below\nstriking a characteristic pose at a recent\nMonday Club meeting.

    "content": "Welcome to the Easter bumper edition of the puzzles column.\nAs before there will be \u00a35 prizes for each of the puzzles plus a \u00a35 prize for those solving all of the puzzles who will\nautomatically have each of their solutions entered for the\nindividual prizes.\nThe first puzzle was invented at the start of this century by HE Dudeney. In my opinion his puzzles were all of a standard of\nelegance and origine lli ty as yet unsurpassed.\nThis was his most popular puzzle, needless to say it is unlikely\nto be new to the experienced puzzler.\n3 0 FT.\nAs shown a spider is at the middle of an end wall, one foot\nfrom the ceiling. The fly is on the middle of the opposite wall one\nfoot from the floor.\nWhat is the shortest distance the spider must crawl over the\nwalls in order to catch the fly?\nGRADE TWO\nHere it is then, the moment you've all been waiting for, your\nchance to show your superiority; here is the puzzle I can't do. It\nis ava rien t of the latter puzzle,from Maurice Kraitchik.\nEight spiders start from a spot 80 inches above the centre of\none end wall of the rectangular room. They take eight different\nroutes to reach a fly that is 80 inches below the centre of the\nopposite wall. Each spider moves at a speed of 0.65 mile per\nhour, and at the end of 625/11 seconds, they all arrive\nsimultaneously at the fly.\nWhat are the room's dimensions?\nGRADE5 In this sentence the number of occur en ces of the number 1 is\nblank, of 2 is blank, of 3 is blank, etc.\nA second sentence is identical but that it begins with the\nnumber nought rather than the number one.\nFind the length of the sentences and the missing numbers\ngiven only that your two answers have an identical number of\nfives yet a different number of fours.\nGRADE4 PUZZLESD\nThe last puzzle is the result of a number of requests for a purely geometrical puzzle.\nProve that A+B=C without using trig.\nGRADE3 Best of Luck\nThe eight different solutions to last fortnight's puzzle are\ngiven by flipping each of the three ambiguous pairs of cubes in\nthe diagram below.\nThere were fifteen solutions of which an all time high of four\nwere wrong. Of the remaining eleven the lucky winner was R Sharp from Computing who may collect his \u00a35 cheque from the\nFELIX office after Wednesday.\nFELIX Wednesday 20 March 1985 11\n\n"

The team was off\nto the best possible start.\nUL2 were their opposition in\nthe next race, or so we were told.\nJones and Apo soon pulled clear\nof the fleet while Mc CLean was\ncontent to hold back the\nopposition. Imperial finally\nfinished miles ahead, first,\nsecond and fourth.\nThe next two races did not go\nso well for Imperial a mix up\nabout the start against West\nKirby resulted in the team\nstarting late and never\nrecovering, whilst Wembley\nsurprised everyone with their\nboat speed.\nIrelands 'Royal St Georges G.' were Imperials next victims\nwithout a doubt Imperial peaked\nin this race, working superbly\nwell together to gain first, second\nand third positions.\nSunday dawned with beautiful\nblue skies and a light variable\nwind. The first race of the day,\nagainst Rickmansworth, was\nvery closely fought with only\ninches s epe rating all six boats at\nthe start. Rickmansworth finally\ngained a marginal advantage,\nwhich they protected to the\nfinish, 'castaways', the hosts,\nappeared to be in trouble at the\nstart of the seventh race.\nHowever, their superior\ntechnique was rapidly evident as\nthey took the fist three positions.\nThe final qualifying race saw\nBennet-Clarks boat forced a ground by a 'Nottingham\nOutlaw' trying to live up to his\nteams name. Some highly\ndubious interpretations of the\nrules concerning pumping and\nrocking saw the 'Outlaws' win\ncomfortably.\nAs a result of Imperials\nexcellent run of results we found\nourselves qualifying for the\n'Gnurds Trophy', Howarth and\nRudge showed everyone what\nstars they truly are be leading the\nfleet around the first mark, with\nMc Clean and Bennet-Clark and\nApo and Jones also in the top ten\nof the fleet. While the standard of\nrule observance appeared to\ndrop with the wind, so\nunfortunately did the teams\npositions. Never the less, the\npink and blue jackets worn by\nevery Imperial team member\nwere all seen to finish in the top\nhalf of the fleet, a successful\nfinale to an excellent weekends\nracing.\nCasterways\ncup\nThe annual inter-college team\nchampionship unfortunately had\nto be con celled on Saturday 23\nFebruary as the reservoir still\nhad several inches of ice\ncovering it! Imperial College, as\ndefenders of the cup were strong\nfavourites to regain its\npossession\u2014especially as they,\nwere the only two teams to turn\nup; all the others had assumed\nthe reservoir to be frozen due to\nthe previous harsh weather!.\nSaturday 2 March \u2022\n\u2022 saw the\nhardened sailors trek to\nSherfield Polytechnic \u2014x he\nwinners of the Northern\nPolytechnic League. Despite\nsuch a trial, Imperial College won\nthe first battle. Due credit must\ngo to Phil Bevan and his brood\nwho demonstrated incredible\nspeed in the boats, spectacular\njive ing, and some breathtaking\nrocking and rolling towards the\nend.\nThe following morning,\ndawned with mist, rain and\nworse, no wind! However, all\nwere up early as the optimistic\n(and indeed correct) captain\nprop he s is ed good sailing\nprospects. By midday, the wind\n-did indeed fill in, and it was then\nthat the team made its first\nmistake\u2014in their excessive\nkeane s s to sail, they had\noverlooked the fact that\nSherfield were not prepared, and\nso almost lost the physical\nadvantage of remaining warm as\nthey had to rig the boats. All was\nnot lost, however, as the new\nteam colour jackets had arrived\nthe previous weekend, and so\nthe team was proud to boast\nthese to the opposition in their\ntrue splendour of pink and blue.\nThe initial races wer hard\nfought and close finales resulted,\nas the advantage swing from\nSheffield to Imperial and back\nmany times. Andy Jones became\nthe savior to the team several\ntimes by showing his deft team\nracing skills of trapping the\nopposition at the winning mark,\nwhilst Hunter Lowe showed\namazing agility on the stark time\ncombined with good up wind speed. However, local\nknowledge of the wind enabled\nSheffield to claim a narrow\nvictory over Imperial.\nIn the final race of the day, the\ncrews mano eu ve red their way to\nthe back of the boats, whilst the\nusual helms played the less\n\u2022 dominant role at the front. At the\nstart, the team looked for midi ble with Helen, Caroline and Jacob\n(who led recently been promoted\nto crew, and was now being given\nthe chance to display his true\ntalent) flying out not a second\nearly for the line, victory could\nnot be assumed too early in the\nrace, as Sherfield pointed out to\nthem by their excellent analysis\nof wind shifts, which put them\nhard on Imperial's transoms\nowing to their superior speed.\nThe second lap saw Sherfield pull\nmarginally ahead, which they\nmaintained until the finish. This\ndid however show impressive\ntalent by the IC Brews, with the\nobvious handicap of having the\nhelms crewing them, by putting\nup such an incredible fight\nagainst such a strong team.\nIn all, an enjoyable weekend\nwas had by everyone.\nBradford\nbarrel\nTravelling North for the second\nweek running\" our intrepid team\nwas ready for anything that\nmight cross their path in this\nFELIX Wednesday 20 March 1985 17\n\n"

    "content": "CINEMA\n2 0 1 0\nDr Chandra, creator of the computer, DrHey wood Floyd, leader\nof the American team, and engineer Walter Cumow, designer of\nthe Discovery craft.\n'My God, its full of stars!'. The\ncredits are as long as your\narm. Still, many hands make\nlight work; 2007 took five\nyears to make,2010 considerably less, and in this\ntime, Peter Hyams, (screen-writer, producer and director\nfor the film) has not only\nprovided a celluloid icon at\nleast comparable in size to its\npredecessor, but has closely\ntailored it to the wishes and\nbeliefs of AC Clarke himself,\neven if they are not in\neveryone's taste.\nThe plot is as comprehensive as it is incredulous.\nRussia and America join\nforces to investigate the\nremains of the Discovery, the\nAmerican research craft deserted beyond Jupiter. As\nthe nature of the planet and its\nmoons (include the giant\nblack monolith) become clear, the two teams are\ncompelled to work together\nopenly, despite increasing\npolitical tension at home. You\ncannot be serious! Their\ndestinies are decided by the\nominous planet, which, as it\nerupts to create a new\nuniverse, sends them back to\nMVIEWSD\na peaceful Earth, in a finale\nreminiscent of some kind of\nintergalactic Hair.\nHyam writes: 'If Arthur C Clarke had not been totally\nsatisfied with my screen play, I would not have made this\nmovie, the ideas, the notion,\nthe concept is his. All along\nthe way, I told him what I was\ngoing to do. Frankly, I wanted\nto know how he felt'. It is this\nexclusive obsession with\nClarke's original ideals that\nthreatens to turn this film into\na cult-work. Unlike Kubrick's'2001' it lacks presentation,\nand style. Special effects,\nalthough enhanced by 70mm work, are naive and un spec ta clar and although where the\npace of the film rises the\nsuspense is sadly un sustain ed. There is some good acting\nfrom Helen Mirren and veteran Roy Sch eider however, coupled with the\nhunk y return of Keir Dullea as\nDave Bowman.\nLike 'Dune' however, the\nSci-Fi enthusiasts will sit\nthrough this unperturbed.\nEveryone else should take a cushion.\nFrom the first few lines you\ncan tell that this is not a film\nthat can be taken seriously.\nSome Bumph like;\n'In every sport there is one\nthat will rise above the rest\nand not be equalled'.\nAll this film seems to have to\nits credit is that it is true.\nAnother over drama tis ed story about an animal. I am\nnot moved by loud dramatic\nmusic and a film of two horses\nracing desperately for the line.\nIf you were in love with Black\nBeauty, then watch this.\nThe film follows the romantic story of the famous\nAustralian horse, 'Phar Lap'.\nIt's arrival in Australia fit only\nfor resale as meat and it's tough training to victory and\nstardom. It was obviously a great horse but I would hardly\ncall him a legend. It would\nappear however that the\nworking class of the d repressed1930' s only survived because their hero\nwas out on the track bankrupting the bookies. Along side this the relationship develops between the\nhorse and its stable boy,\nTommy Woodcock( Tom Burlinson), who later rises to\nbecome are known ed trainer.\nThe Film ends with the\nhorses mysterious death\nsixteen days after his first\nAmerican, and most successful race.\nPhar Lap \u2014 the\nheart of a nation\nFELIX\n!\nWednesday 20 March 1985 15\n\n"

It is the Mecca of school\nchildren everywhere in the country, and its\nfame has spread throughout the world.\nLike so much in this area, the Science\nMuseum was spawned by the Great\nExhibition of 1851. The collections from the\nExhibition were housed in the 'South\nKensington Museum', later re-named the\nVictoria and Albert. But the V&A soon\nbecame too small to house the science and\nart collections and in 1909 the Science\nMuseum was formed as a separate\nadministrative entity.\nThe museum is at present undergoing a a j or re-organisation\u2014some galleries are\ntemporarily closed, but new ones are\nspringing up.\nOne of the newest innovations for the\nmuseum is the 'Synopsis' Gallery\u2014it is\nadvertised as an introduction to the\nmuseum. But it is much, much more than\nthat. Starting from pre-history it traces the\nscientific/archaeological progress of man\nthrough the ages. There are superb models\nof ancient settlements\u2014iron age, bronze\nage, roman. It goes on to cover the 'great age\nof learning', the scientists of the 18th Century, the Industrial revolution and the\nadvent of science as we know it.\nThe\nScience\nMuseum\nThe Synopsis Gallery is a museum in\nminiature. It contains excellent scale models\nof machines from looms to printing presses,\nfrom power stations to railway stations.\nAs you would expect, the last 150 years of\nscience dominate the gallery. There are mini-displays on the train, the telephone and the\nwireless\u2014the technological advances that\nhave truly changed the world.\nBut the centre-piece of the gallery, and in\nmany ways the most thought provoking\nexhibit, is a scale model of a small town and\nits environs. The taped commentary records\nhow the coming of the railway, and other\ntechnological 'advances' affected the town\nand its people. One leaves understanding, if\nnot sym pathi sing with, the Luddites.\nSouth Kensington Museum 1857\n6 Wednesday 20 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS!]\ncancelled as a result of 'this pointless and\nstupid tradition of mascot ry', I should like to\nmake a few comments.\nAs Miss Eriksen accurately explains, an IC\nUnion van was criminally damaged by CMC\nstudents. However, by my understanding of\nthe rules of mascot ry this action is entirely\nirrelevant to the earlier violation of their\nmascot, Mary, by RCSU and is the kind of\nbehaviour which would not be condoned by\nthe student unions at Imperial College in a( hypothetical) reversal of roles.\nMascoty is a Rag Activity\u2014violated\nmascots being ransomed back to their\nowners, the proceeds being donated to\ncharity. Over the last five years, RCS\nmascot ry alone has raised of the order of\n\u00a31000 for Rag. I wonder what contributions\nto Rag events Miss Eriksen has made in three\nand half years.\nI was a member of a group of about twelve\nwho spent the whole of Friday evening at\nQMC, replacing the stolen wheels and towing\nthe van back to IC. If YHA club were so keen\nto go to Dartmoor, why didn't any of their\nmembers volunteer to help recover the van?\nDoes it require too much inti at ive of YHA\nclub to hire a van from an outside company?\nPersonally, I see no reason why ICU\nshould finance students to go youth-hostelling and I should like to see ICYHA\nabolished.\nThe highly self-centred attitude expressed\nin Miss Eriksen's letter is the root cause of\nmost internal problems in IC Union.\nYours sincerely,\nIan Thomas\nPhysics 3\nMisstake\nDear Sir,\nI have recently been applying for jobs, and\nas. each company requires a different form\nthis takes a considerable amount of time.\nRecently I received a rejection letter from\nLogica signed by a female.

Due to the timing of\nthe deadline, however, the decision had to be\nmade quickly so I could obtain the required\nnumber of second ers. Since then I had time to consider what I have to offer as a candidate and found that I do not know enough about the job to be able\nto start in a confident manner, and , as I still\nhave the final year of my degree to complete\nand worry about, I do not feel that I could\ngive the position the effort and dedication\nthat is required for such an influential post,\nThus for this, and another personal reason,\nI decided to stand down.

Each night\nthree sets are shown out of a total of eight. The first\nprogramme contained the\npopular and visually enjoyable\nSergeant Early's Dream.\nIt is based on Irish/American\nfolk music and the Irish\npeasants migration to the new\nworld, showing scenes of\npeasant life. Prominent are the\naspects of youth, love and\nbravery and sadness in leaving\nfor the New World. These\nscenes are interspersed rather\nun fluently with comic scenes\nof young love, flirting girls and\ndrunken ess. Some of the\nmovements are cleverly choreographed and wonderful\nto watch.\nThe music is performed by a small group on stage with\nmad olin, fiddle and pipes and\nmade up of members from\n'Carrig' and 'Incantation'.\nSINGLES\nThe Smiths: Shakespeare's Sister\nThe ever pretentious Morrisey (I'm not the only\none!) wails on as usual. Still,\nyou have to admit, this is\nbetter than the usual banal\nstuff\u2014In fact were it not for\nthe voice this'd probably be\nOK. 'Psychobilly' is probably\nthe only way to describe it.\nSlade: Mysterious Mizster\nJones\nReally exciting. Slade y without being OTT. Gary\nGlitter 1985 feel. Probably the\nbest single I 've heard forages.\nActually it's rubbish almost.\nAnd do you know what I hate\nmost of all about it? All those\nstupid w allies that go around\njoining in with all the Mysterious Mizster Jones.\nAaaargh!\nAmil Stewart: That Loving\nFeeling\nFollow-up to Friends\u2014but\nnothing like it. Typical musa k \u2014lift music. It's been\ndescribed as winding down\nmusic for after a party. I'm not\nsure whether that's because\nyou don't care what you're\nlistening to when you're\nclearing up crap or whether\nyou need to be pissed to enjoy\nit. I never even noticed when it\nfinished.\nThere is singing and group\ndances based on traditional\ncountry dances, which all\nhelps to induce a gipsy\natmosphere.\nThe second dance was not\nso well received. Although I enjoy hearing atonal music live\nI do not think it was so well\ndanced. Described as a 'Structural Study' based on\nIndian myth, I was disappointed to see the Bird God\nreappear, so common in ballet.\nIt would appear to be a dance\nmore reminiscent of classical\nballet fairy tales, which invariably need the story\nexplained before hand.\nAs, perhaps, one of the least\naccessible art forms I would\nsay that the dancing was very\nenjoyable. I was sup rise d to\nsee a high proportion of people\nunder twenty in the audience\nand the Ballet Rambert still\nmade a very enjoyable evening\n(although perhaps not as great\nas they can be).\nCocteau Twins: AikeauGuinea\nBoth the last single Pearly\nDewdrops Drop and the\nalbum Treasure were number\none in the indie charts. This is\nalmost identical so it'll\nprobably do the same. Droning on and on it does\nlittle for me. All it has going for\nit is the inevitable biting indie\nedge!\nDavid Grant and Jaki Graham:\nCould It Be I'm Falling In Love\nHaving consistently failed to\nbeat the chart hyper s with his\nprevious singles, this is a big\nchange of image to a ballad\nduet with his Birmingham\nsinger girlfriend.

Top ten I reckon.\nMeat Loaf: Piece Of The\nAction\nRemixed from his album\nBad Attitude this is clearly a failed attempt to recreate the\nepic atmosphere from BOOH.\nIt spends four minutes really\ngetting nowhere (fast?). Only\nthe hardened fans will buy this\nbut I suppose it's not so bad to\nhear in the background.\nBANDS\nGrandmaster, Melle Mel and\nThe Furious Five at The Camden Palace. Sunday,\nMarch 10.\nTime may change the exact\nname and structure of The\nFurious Five, but it cannot\naffect their outrageous appearance, vibrant music and\nkeen following\nPeople perched from every\nstaircase and balcony, turning\nthe Palace into a seething\namphitheatre of noise.\nAI though the smoke machines took time to warm\nup, Grandmaster did not.\nWithin half an hour, those that\nhad taken their lives into their\nhands and crowded around\nthe stage had been sprayed\nwith champagne, subjected, to\nan ear-shattering rap of 'Close\nTo The Edge' and encouraged\nto jump, sway or slide to their\nheart's content.\nAs well as the well known,\nfast, slick music, there was also\nsome less funky stuff,\nincluding their new single for\nEthiopia. I'd like to say that it is\ndestined to be a great success,\nfor obvious reasons, but that\njust wouldn't be true. Indeed\nfollowing the marvellous Sfep\nOff, it was the anti-climatic\nending to an otherwise memorable concert.\nA scene from Dramsoc's recent production of Look Back in\nAnger. The production managed to achieve the hip b standards\nof most recent Dramsoc shows. Mike Bridgeland, w no played\nJimmy Porter, was superbly cynical as the angry young man.\nHis two women Sally Pilbrow and Elizabeth Barton, managed to\nachieve the changes in mood necessary without stooping to\nover acting and Ciaran Hasset, who played Cliff Lewis, was\nexcellent as the man caught in the middle of the argument.\n45 rPm\n14 Wednesday 20 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022TITERS\nLetter causes controversy\nMascotry\nv YHA\nDear Sir,\nI will willing take up the 'challenge' to\nreply to Mr Eriksen's letter denigrating\nmascot ry, having also been at College for\nthree and a half years and spending a large\nproportion of that time involved in mascot ry. By far the most entertaining activities-throughout this time have involved the\npurloining of mascots. They are a tradition\nonce common throughout London colleges if\nnot all England but unfortunately through a variety of reasons, usually that other colleges\nwere sick of having their mascots pinched by\nImperial, it remains to us to continue the\nnoble art.\nIf Mr Eriksen were to spend some time\ntalking to past members of College rather\nthan in single-sex dormitories he might\nrealise that the one of three things that\nstudents recall most often from their time at\nImperial is Mascotry (the other two being\nMorphy Day and Field Cup, two other much\nmaligned activities).\nSome hilarious stories have been told\nconcerning mascots ever since the constituent,\ncolleges were formed. Perhaps it would be an'\nidea to serial is e them as they would probably\nmake interesting and amusing reading to a wide audience.\nMascotry now involves from fifty up to a hundred or more people per CCU, more than\nmost societies and requires considerably less\nmoney per capita indeed no claim is\nnecessary from Guilds to cover expenses.\nMr Eriksen, you wish to see Mascot\nstopped at this College after a small non-ref cresent at ive group of students\u2014not even\nfrom IC, have mis demeaned. I find this\nj at her harsh speaking as one who lives in the\ncounty of North Yorkshire I would not like to\nsee the banning of the whole of the YHA\nbacause of the disgusting, untidy behaviour\nof some of its members who leave litter and\ndamage everywhere causing great 'money\nand inconvenience' to the 'innocent public' of\nwhom you are so concerned.\nThis bring to mind another interesting\npoint, why did the un availability of one van\nmean Mr Eriksen had to cancel the whole\nweekend? Does he not have the initiative to\nuse Public Transport? Perhaps this might\ninvolve a certain amount of walking but I seem to remember from my hostelling days\nthat that was the main purpose. Good\nplaning would put the first hostel near to a station. Were this to happen the College vans\nwould then be available to a few more clubs\nand societies at weekends who require their\nuse for perhaps half a day each rather than\nmono poli sing them unused\u2014in a Youth\nHostel car park for the weekend.\nMr Eriksen's letter indicated that he knows\nvery little about Mascotry. It is nothing to do\nwith 'letting off steam in a competitive\nmanner'\u2014the vast majority'-of people\ninvolved in Mascotry also play at least one\nsport\u2014the aim of Mascotry is to obtain\nmascots with a minimum of violence or\ndamage. Admittedly there are incidents\nwhere someone has been hurt or damage\ncaused and these are bound to attract\nattention, but they are looked back on\ndistastefully and perpetrators are\nreprimanded.\nIt would be gratifying to learn that the\nYHA took the same attitude with members\nwho broke their rules of conduct.\nYours,\nMike Bartlett\nC& GU VP 82-83\nYHA member 71-80\nMinority\ninterest\nDear Sir,\nHaving just read 'QMC fooled in ambush\nbluff and the letter from YHA President in\nFELIX No 699, I feel compelled to add my\nown comments on the vandal iz ation of HLO\nby QMC Union.\nI have no particular views on mascot ry and\ndon't object to it as long as the stealing is\nconfined to violate mascots. A Union van, as\nfar as I am aware is not a mascot, violate or\notherwise, and its vandal iz ation and the\nstealing of wheels and electrical components\nhas caused many people considerable\nin con vi en ce. The Union vans are in\ncontinuous use by College clubs and\nsocieties, mainly from RCC and ACC, and by\nother groups including CCUs. This creates\nenough problems of maintenance, bookings\netc already without the problem of the vans\nbeing brought into the mascot ry farce. Few\npeople seem to realise that the vans are not to\nbe involved in mascot ry in any way, shape or\nform. Geoffrey Reeves is quoted as saying\n'This is what you expect when you steal\nsomeones mascot', when he saw the\nretaliation C& GU had arranged for QMC. I don't know if this is a true quote in the correct\ncontext, but if it is then it gives the disturbing\nimpression that security considers vans in the\nsame light as mascots. Also this retaliation\nattack will do nothing to help relations with\nQMC over the return of HLOs missing\nwheels. RCSU also consider vans in the same\nlight as mascots, judging by the last sentence\nin the article. (Mary, the QMC mascot, is still\nin the possession of RCSU and its return will\nnot be considered until the return of the\nwheels). I find it distressing that because of\nthe activities of minor users of the vans, the\nmajority of reliable users are inconvenienced\nYours,\nSteve Lane\nICUTO\n....\nAppeal for\nsense\nDear Sir,\nI write in reply to last week's letter from S Eriksen. As a CCU President I obviously\nhave more than a passing interest in mascot ry and would like to give some arguments in\nfavour of its pursuit.\nThe whole aim of mascot ry is to raise\nmoney for charities by relieving a rival\ncollege of a violate mascot, which is then\nransomed back for a donation to rag. An\nimportant side-effect is a sense of\ncomradeship amongst a team of people who\nboth protect their own mascots and search\nfor those of other colleges.\nHowever it is obvious that since mascot ry appears to the majority of students as a 'pointless and silly tradition', somewhere\nalong the line the admirable intentions and\npurpose of the 'sport' of mascot ry have been\nsadly misinterpreted.\nIt is high time that all mascot e ers realise it\nis not the end of the world if their mascot is\nlost. They should accept it in the spirit of the\ntradition\u2014not resorting to violence while\nprotecting their mascot; or to petty acts of\nvandalism as a revenge if they lost it. Surely it\nis apparent that unless attitudes relax and\npeople are willing not only to risk losing a mascot occasionally, but also to retrieve it\nwith good grace, the very pastime which they\nso care about will not survive at all.\nYours faithfully,\nAnn Collins\nAbolish YHA!\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Miss Eriksen's whining\ncomplaint that her weekend holiday in\nDartmoor at the Union's expense, had to be\n4 Wednesday 20 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "IFHIuI\nFounded1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union Bar Prices\nto Rocket?\nPrices in College bars could be set to rise by up to 1Opa pint, if\nthey continue to serve beers not approved by the student union\npurchasing consortium, the Bars Working Party (BWP). The\nBWP is also threatening to withdraw its discounts from Imperial\nbecause the bars are not run by the Union.\nThe BWP negotiates special deals\nwith several major breweries on\nbehalf of most student unions.\nAlthough the bars at Imperial are\nCollege-run they presently\nobtain the discount because of\nUnion involvement in the Bar\nCommittee, which is chaired by\nthe Deputy President. However,\nnon-student union run bars may\nnot qualify in the future.\nA condition of membership of\nthe scheme is that only the\nrecommended suppliers with\nwhich deals have been struck\nshould be used. At present the\nbars stock Watneys, Courage,\nBass and Whitbread beers, of\nwhich only the first two are BWP\napproved. Due to increasing use\nof other suppliers by a number of\nstudent unions, including\nImperial, the volume of trade\nunder BWP deals has dropped. A motion at a recent BWP meeting\ncalled for strict enforcement of\nthe rules, and decided that unions\nfailing to restrict their purchases\nto approved suppliers would be\nthrown out of the consortium.\nThe main non-BWP beer at IC\nis Wethereds, which is supplied\nby Whitbread. It seems likely\nthat this and other non-BWP\nbeers will have to be dropped,\notherwise prices will have to rise\nsubstantially.\nIn a further development in\nstudent union purchasing the\nNational Union of Students\n(NUS) is attempting to set up an\numbrella organisation, the\nNational Student Services\nOrganisation (NSSO), taking in\nthe BWP, the Student Union\nPurchasing Consortium (SUPC),\nthe National Association of\nStudent Travel Offices\n(NASTO), and other similar\norganisations.\nThe proposed new constitution of this body would exclude\nunions not affiliated to the NUS\nunless they join in the first year of\nits existance. Subsequently non-affiliated union would not be\neligible to join and any union\nd is affiliating would be thrown\nout of NSSO. At present the\nvarious independent consortia\nhave only tenuous links with\nNUS, and NUS affiliation is not a condition of membership.\nThe NUS has not been active in\nthe services field since the mid-70s when NUS Travel collapsed\nand Endsleigh Insurance was\nsold off. The present ad hoc\nsystem of consortia grew up after\nNUS's with drawl from trading\nactivities.\nThe present organisations are\nbeing asked to wind-up their\naffairs and pass their assets to\nNSSO at their AGMs taking\nplace over Easter. The NSSO will\nbe set up at a special Student\nServices conference, also over\nEaster. It seems certain that the\nchange will go ahead, with the\nconditions for membership of\nNSSO being finally decided at its\nforthcoming conference.\nUGM Flan Fiasco!\nThis year's and next year's sabbaticals were Harmed by RCS during the\nResults U GM last Thursday, including Hon Sec elect Quentin Fontana\n(above). Dave Parry refused to be 'hit' because he was wearing a 'clean'\nshirt! Elections were held at the meeting for U GM Chairman, won by\nChris Hendy; External Affairs Officer, won by Grenville Manuel; and\nInternal Services Chairman, won by Alan Rose. Other officers elected\nunopposed were John Ingham (Rag Chairman), J Martin Taylor\n(Academic Affairs) and Peter Wilson (Welfare Officer).\nOxford Thrashed!\nThe IC University Challenge\nteam scored a resounding victory\nin their first match against\nSomerville College, Oxford. The\nteam of Simon Errington, Dick\nLangstaff, Duncan Swan and\nTim Williams won by 485 point\nto 217.\nThe Show's presenter Bamber\nGascoyne described the win as\none of the biggest ever in that\nform of the competition.

We could hardly contain our ex c it ment( misprint). After what seemed like years of\nbanging our heads against a brick wall, we\nhad finally achieved something concrete\n(well, die-cast aluminium actually). For those\nof your who haven't got the foggiest idea of\nwhat I am talking about, we have just taken\ndelivery of a new colour enlarger, which is\nnow in the old darkroom waiting to be used.\nIt is Berkey-Omega C760 modular unit with a voltage-stab li is ed dich roi c colour-head. It's big, black, beautiful and very expensive; so\nmuch so that we won't be able to replace it\nfor at least ten years. And so if we catch\nanyone mistreating it even slightly, they\nreally will get their goo lies chopped off and\nnailed to the door, and we are not joking. We\nwill be arranging some colour printing\ndemonstrations soon, anyone who wants to\nattend one should sign their name on the\nusual notice-board.\nDue to the general apathetic nature of the\naverage IC student, we have only had one\n10-PIN BOWLING\nMoonlight\nBowl\nToday sees the Annual CCU competition,\nwith Guilds v RCS v Mines. To make sure of\nyour college winning the CCU trophy, turn\nup to get the best possible chance.\nYesterday was our AGM at The Three\nKings. The results of the Elections will be in a later report.\nNext term will see a possible trip to\nHeathrow for a 'Moonlight Bowl', a midnight\ntill 3 am job. Watch out for further details.\nLastly, to all those avid sports report\nreaders (both of you!), you may wonder\nabout our year's matches. Well, we lost all six\nmatches in the universities' championship,\nbut in the Brunei Doubles tournament, two\npairs came first and third from\napproximately sixty teams. Also, the annual\nBirmingham Marathon was cancelled thus\nrobbing me of my only stimulation for the\nyear.\nAnyway, that's enough of the rundown;\nwatch this space for the exciting news of next\nyear's committee.\nentry for our FELIX competition. We have\ntherefore (rather op tim is it ic ally) put the\ndeadline back to the end of term. If we\nhaven't had more than three entries by then\nwe will give up in disgust! Remember, there\nwill be prizes of Jessop's vouchers for the\nwinner and runner up, and with so little\ncompetition any old rubbish could win. Just\nto remind you, each entry should consist of\nfour B& W or Colour prints, of any size and\nof varied subject-matter. Entries should be\nhanded to the Photosoc committee by the\nend of term, or, alternatively, send them to H Rudd, Chemistry PG, via the internal 'mail'.\nAlso due to lack of interest, the trip to Syon\nPark Butterfly House which was to have\nbeen on Sunday has been can cell led. Are IC\nstudents totally devoid of even the slightest\nspark of creativity? Are they really just a bunch of Neanderthal Philistine Pissheads\nwho divide their time between lying\nhorizontal in the bar and throwing up in the\nbog. The answer, reached after nearly five\nyears of careful observation, is a resounding\nyes! With members like this, it's no wonder\nthat nobody ever turns up to the events we\norganise, and we're really pissed off with it.\nPhotosoc does not just exist to provide a service! It is supposed to be a club, with\nproper club activities. It seems that a lot of\nmembers are joining just to use the\ndarkroom and take for granted all the hard\nwork put in by the committee. Next year we\nshall be taking measures to combat this\ntendency, you have been warned.\nFinally, just a quick reminder that it's our\nAGM today (usual time, usual place). And\nalso don't forget the 'Fox-Talbot'\ndemonstration on March 21 in Elec Eng 408\nat 6.00pm. DANCE CLUB\nImperial\nWaltz to\nvictory\nOn Friday 22 February, two teams plus\nnumerous supporters travelled to Oxford for\nthe Southern Universites Ballroom Dancing\nChampionships. The venue was Cowley\nWorking Men's Club (very glamorous!) and\nseven universit es, each entering two or three\nteams took part.\nOur second team came second in the 'B' team trophy competition with Neil\nMcCluskey and Shirley Brown dancing\nbrilliantly to take third place in the jive. Jim\nCohen and Louise Barker reached the\nsecond round of the quickstep with Paul\nJeremaen and Hilary Todd only narrowly\nmissing the final. Field Kondowe and\nCarolyn Burn pulled out all the stops to win\nthe jive, the Cha-cha-cha also being won by\nImperial in the shape of Dave Caballero and\nAnnabel Mak. The waltz saw Chris Yates\nand Jill Barrett taking first place most\nconvincingly and in the open Paso Doble\nDave Annabel added yet another trophy to\nthe collection by coming first.\nThus, with three first places our first team\nwon the 'A' team trophy\u2014the first time\nImperial has ever won it. Not content with\nwinning the Southern, our first team went to\nCambridge on March 9 to try for the\ndouble\u2014the National title. This time there\nwere 19 universit es taking part, but IC was\nundeterred and once again left with a host of\ntrophies. For Chris and Jill these consisted of\na fourth place in Open Tango plus the\nNational Inter-varsity Waltz Trophy. Dave\nand Annabel held on to their National Intervarsity cha-cha-cha title and managed to\nreach the/semi-final of the Open Tango (after\nonly one' lesson!). The most closely fought\ncontest 'was the jive, with Field and Carolyn\ntaking third place.\nThis meant that Imperial had made history\na second time\u2014winning the inter-varsity\nTrophy and the London Challenge Cup\n(presented to the highest placed London\nteam\u2014UCL and ULU also competed).\nFinally, Dave and Annabel were awarded the\nEdna Murphy Shield as the most promising\ncouple in the competition.\nA very tired group of dancers piled in to\nthe coach for the return journey and many\nbottles of wine were consumed. Dave gave\nTango lessons to some of the female\nsupporters (inner thigh contact is very\nimportant in this dance) whilst Chris and Jill\nimproved their chances in any future Rumba\ncompetitions on the back seat(rumba is the\ndance of love\u2014need I say more?). Other\npeople on the coach have bribed me\nsufficiently, so I shall say nothing about\nShirley Brown's indiscretions.\nFELIX Wednesday 20 March 1985 13\n\n"

    "content": "COPINION\nT) he Brandt report published in\n1980 reads, 'It is a question of\nenabling the inventiveness and\nenterprise of scientists and\nengineers everywhere to give the\n/uli lest possible benefit to mankind',\nand goes on, 'greater international,\nregional efforts are needed to\nsupport the development of\ntechnology in developing countries'.\nIn this article we would like to present\nsome arguments about the overseas\nstudents and talk about the aspects of life for\nover e seas students at Imperial. There are\n846 overseas students at Imperial, as\nclassified by fees, 17.2% of the college,\npopulation. 280 are undergraduates and 566\ndo advanced courses of research.\nThe question is who is the 'big winner?';\nthe students that gain the education or the\ncollege that earns from \u00a33475 to \u00a35125 from\neach overseas student. It is our firm belief\nthat education is not a game or a battle of\nwinning sides, but a long process of\ninteraction and co-operation on an\ninternational basis with results that benefit\nmankind on the whole.\nIt is true that the benefits are often long\nterm revenue and not immediately\ndiscernible on a crude and hurried approach,\nand this is the approach that has supported\nthe high fees charged to overseas students to\nthe dismay of most people in the university\nsectors, including home students, academic\nand non-academic staff. We will here try to\npoint to some arguments which advocate\nthat education of foreign students in the UK\n(and the making of this education possible by\nalleviation of the financial stress), besides\nadvancing technology in and its correct\ntransfer to the developing countries, also\nbenefits Britain.\nA lot of .foreign students are involved in\nresearch prog am mes( at Imperial about 40%\nof the research students are overseas) and\ntherefore form s tong links with the British\nacademic and scientific world, which\ncontinue to be their communication line\nonce they return to their countries.\nOverseas students, once back in their\ncountries ensure that correct transfer of\nappropriate technology takes place,\nprotecting their nations from possible\nmismanagement from big companies and\nensuring a smooth co-operation which\nresults in steady development and healthy\neconomical planning. Besides, they form the\nbasis for the collaboration of British\nengineering firms and co un sultan cie s, as\nProfessor J Dowling pointed out in the\n'Engineering for Wealth' Simposium of the\nCentenary Celebrations. He said that he felt\nvery sharply about it and more overseas\nstudents should be trained here from a better\nbalance of countries (to include the poor\nones), since they facilitate British exports\nand collaboration in overseas countries. It\nmust be noted here that last year only \u00a3561m came to England from British consultants\nand engineers working abroad. And of\ncourse there are the exports of British\nproducts, British technology and know how;\nwhen this is done correctly it is of obvious\nbenefit to both parties. But there cannot be\nexports if the market is not available, and\nthere cannot be a market and healthy trade if\nthe countries are in economical crisis and\nhave no need for the products that are\noffered, nor ability to use the modern\ntechnology due to lack of expertise,\ntechnological gap, financial crisis or\notherwise.\nIt is therefore obvious that the well being of\nthe underdeveloped and developing\ncountries, besides being a matter of justice\nand humanitarian concern\u2014which is not\ndiscussed here as it is self-evident, is also of\nextreme importance for a balanced trade\nand international co-operation on scientific,\neconomic, technological and other aspects.\nThe industrialised countries have not been\nwilling to go very far towards accepting the\nSouth's case that the world economy works\nto the South's disadvantage. The Brandt\nOverseas\nStudents\nreport has argued that 'North and South\nhave more interests in common on a medium\nand long\u2014term basis than many have so far\nbeen able to recognise' and 'we are becoming\naware that a quickened pace of development\nin the South also serves the people in the\nNorth'.\nIt is therefore obvious that hampering the\neducation of overseas students in the UK by\ncharging them such high fees does not in the\nlong term benefit anyone, and in the short\nterm only helps to make up the income of the\nuniversities that are hit by cuts in education.\nThis is alarming as the foreign student is\noften treated as a commodity item to raise\nmoney for the College. With this approach,\nthis College has managed to recover from\nthe drop in the number of overseas students\nafter the charging of high fees, by organising\nrecruitment visits to foreign countries, such\nas the recent ones in Malaysia, Singapore\nand Hong-Kong, and so promoting Imperial\nCollege. However, it is obvious from\nreferences in the report that the College has\nto address the 'wealthy' students or the\ninstitutions and governments.that can afford\nthe fees. Therefore, although the numbers of\nover e seas students are recovered, the\nbalance of their countries of origin might be\nupset and include only rich countries or\nindividuals of extremely poor countries that\nget scholarship aid. We deplore the cuts\nimposed on British universities as they inhibit\nthe benefit that can be achieved by education\nand scientific research which form the basis\nof world progress.\nThe recent UGC (University Grants\nCommittee) visit and the comments made by\nits members seem to advocate even further\nthe idea and image of the 'fully\nprofitable/cost effective' foreign student,\nurging for even more money to be charged if\na particular form of laboratory assistance is\nrequired. We are extremly dismayed to hear\nsuch discriminatory policies advocated by\nsuch an influential body as the UGC, and\nwere only reassured by the solid su port that\nwe have so far received from IC Union, home\nstudents and the a dade mic and non-academic staff representatives, which we\ngreatly appreciate.\nWe do not enjoy being treated as an\nimpersonal 'endless' money source without\nconsideration for the people that are\nspending this money and devoting their\nlabour to further education and research to\nthe benefit of Britain as well as their own\ncountry.\nThis brings us to the second aspect of our\narticle, which is the problems that are faced\nby overseas students at Imperial. Cultural\ndifferences and, even more, different ways of\nteaching, and different customs should not\nbe something that is underestimated and\noverlooked just because it is heard very\noften, since it often results in unnecessary\nfriction, anger, frustration and general\nunhappiness which, we are sure, is unwanted\nfrom both parties. Imperial presents a unique\nplace for an International life, since it has\nstudents form nearly 45 different countries.\nThe potential of cultural interaction and\nintellectual stimulation is immense and is\nonly suppressed by the stress that the\nacademic requirements often impose on all\nof us.\nAt Imperial College there are fifteen\nNational societies: Afro-carri bean, Bangladesh, Chinese, Chinese Students and\nScholars Association, Cypriot, Friends of\nPalestine, Hellenic, Indian, Iranian, Latin\nAmerican, Nigerian, Pakistan, Singapore,\nSri-Lanka, and Turkish. They have activities\nthe whole year round. All these societies\nform the overseas students body which is coordinated by the Overseas Students\nCommittee (OSC), elected annually. The\nOSC is represented in the Union Council\nand throughout the year organises its own\nfunctions of International spirit.\nIn this article we have attempted to touch\non some of the aspects of the presence of\nOverseas students at Imperial. It has by no\nmeans covered all we'd like to talk about and\nwe hope to include other topics later.\n16 Wednesday 20 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"

The competition\nthis year was to be hotly\ncontested at this, the climax of\nthe season.\nHaving been first to arrive and\nlast to leave at the reception\nparty on Friday night, the team\nwas all ready for an early start on\nSaturday.\nThe racing started with a drift\naround the course with\nEdinburgh and Birmingham. By\nlunchtime, however, the wind\nhad picked up to a demanding\nForce 1. With both members of\nthe crew fully hiked out (one\neach side) the race against Aston\n(this years BUSA champions)\nbegan. The Robson/Burrows\ncombination got a crack ng start\nclosely followed by Bevan and\nJeffries. Lowe and Hill decided to\nhang back to buff an Aston Boat\nthe wrong side of the start line.\nAfter a few slick roll tacks and a few lucky wind shifts Lowe\nrounded the windward mark in\nsecond place with Bevan fourth.\nThe positions didn't change on\nthe downwind legs, so it was left\nto the final boat to save the day.\nLowe covered the Aston boat\nwhile Bevan attempted to get 100\ntacks in on one boat. The tactics\nworked and Lowe finished\nsecond with Bevan third. Aston\nleft the race having sailed their\nhardest match of the weekend.\nThe results of the 'Alternative\nBarrel' were contested on\nSaturday evening at the Shinla\nc ury Louse\u2014a place of dubious\nreputation. IC v Edinburgh was\nto be the deciding race.\nEdinburgh got off to an early\nstart and claimed first place.\nImpressive chapa ti manipulation\nwas demon stated by Robson\nwho pumped home to finish\nsecond. By this time some of the\nEdinburgh team were calling for\n'Water', but there was no overlap\nand they were forced to take a green.\nIC came in third and fifth and\nclaimed the trophy, leaving,\nEdinburgh shouting for a general\nrecall, but to no avail.\nGOLF\nOn Wednesday 13 March\nImperial College Golfing Society\nheld their spring 36 hole\nStableford competition. The day\nproved to be very enjoyable for\neveryone who turned up. The\nmorning's session was won by\nDave Lang who manage 36\nPoints, narrowly beating David\nJakubovic (33 pts) and the\nsociety's captain, Phil Hughes\nNarborough (32 pts). In the\nafternoon, everyone seemed to\nbe suffering from hearing about\nDave's36 pts, and the overall\nstandard of play fell. However\nHuw Jones did manage to secure\n32 points and was subsequently\ndeclared the afternoon's winner.\nSpecial credit goes to Adam\nCampbell, who although unable\nto play in the morning, returned acorn men a, ble 31 pts during this\nlatter session of play.\nFinally, after the last shot had\nbeen hit and the last putt sunk,\nthe majority of those who played\nenjoyed an excellent meal in the\nclubhouse. Special thanks go to\nour guest at the dinner, last years\ncaptain, Marin Ross.\nOne final item of news for all\nthe society's members is that the\nclub championship will be held\nnext term on Wednesday May 8.\nHOCKEY\nFlying\nthe flag\nThis season the 3rd XI have\nflown the flag for the hockey\nclub. With new shirts at the\nbeginning of the season, we were\ndetermined to prove that this\nwas a good investment. From the\nstart success came our way with\na good 6\u20144 win over OMT's. After this initial victory we never .\nlooked backed and our final tally\nof results reads: played 8, won 5,\ndrew 1 and lost 2 with 25 goals\nscored and 17 conceded.\nThroughout the season there\nwas good commitment from the\nmajority of players and a regular\ncore of about 8 players was\nestablished. Thanks go to all\nthose who played for the thirds.\nNotably performances were\nachieved by our top scorers Per\nDullforce and Jonathan Sturgers\nwho both scored 4 goals each\nand Vernon Morris who\nachieved the unique distinction\nof breaking his jaw and also\nabout 4 hockey sticks!\nOther players who made\ninvaluable contributions include\nJohn (Sgt Pepper) Spencer,\nDave Gott, Ian Mace, Richard\nEllis, Steve Brooker, Scott\nFraser and in goal Chris Jones.\nRUGBY\nBottle\nretained\nOn Sunday March the 10 the\nRoyal School of Mines Rugby\nclub retained the 'Bottle' in their\nannual encounter with the\nCamborne School of Mines.\nThe match, cancelled because\nof snow in February, was\neventually started at Exeter in\nperfect rugby conditions.\nMoving at a frantic pace first\nblood went to RSM as a penalty\nwas kicked by K Douglas. CSM\nmissed four reasonable first half\nchances to turn round at half\ntime 3\u20140 down. However things\ndidn't stay that way for long as\ntheir fly-half scored a good\ndropped goal the ball going in off\na post. Worse was to follow as\nthe Camborne winger intercepted an RSM backs movement\nand raced away the length of the\nfield to score an un converted try.\nThe match was still very close\nand RSM pressure was rewarded\nwith another penalty which was\nkicked to make the score 7\u20146.\nIn to the final ten minutes both.\nteams missed kicks which were\ncrucial until K Douglas put over a penalty from just inside the CSM\nhalf to pull the game out of the\nfire, RSM wining 9\u20147. The\nmatch was extremely close but\nfortunately the Bottle will stay in\nLondon for another year.\nThanks must go to all supporters\nwho travelled to Exeter and the\nBottle match team and reserves.\nWhat did you do this\nweekend?\n-and did you enjoy it?\nLondon can be an exciting place to\nlive\u2014but only if you know the ropes. In\nOctober several hundred fresh faced first\nyears will arrive at Imperial College and you\ncan help them enjoy their first few weeks\nhere to the full.\nA few weeks before the start of the academic year all first\nyear students receive a copy of the IC Union Handbook.\nCan you pass on information to help them in their first\nyear?

    "content": "NEWS!]\nRed Ken admits\nfailure\nKen Livingstone and Piers\nCorbyn, a former President of\nICU, spoke in the Great Hall at\nTuesday's Socialist Society\nmeeting. Mr Corbyn, now a specialist on Energy Policy in the\nLabour movement, began by\ncondemning what he described as\na 'disgraceful display of\nbackstabbing and back sliding' in\nthe wake of the failure of the\ncampaign in the GLC to defy the\nGovernment's rate-capping law.\nHe was deeply critical of those in\nthe London councils who\nfavoured setting a rate within the\nGoverment limits. Mr Corbyn\nwent on to speak about the\nminers' strike, and criticised the\nLabour Party leadership for\nfailing to give, proper support on\nboth this issue and that of rate-capping. He attacked the closure\nof coal pits on grounds other\nthan exhaustion.saying that once\nclosed a pit is always very costly\nor impossible to reopen. The coal\nindustry is not only a valuable\nemployer, but also provides\nBritain's only alternative to\nexpanding the nuclear power\nprogramme, a prospect Mr\nCorbyn abhorred.\nKen Livingstone, leader of the\nGLC, then spoke in response to\nMr Corbyn's criticism, much of\nwhich he accepted, saying of the\nGLC's campaign against rate-capping; 'Not only did we fail,\nbut we actually failed more\ndramatically than the Government intended us to'. He said that\nhe had always doubted whether\nthe GLC would vote for an illegal\nrates policy, but that having\nfailed to obtain such a vote, the\nLondon councils still have\nanother option: that of running a budget deficit rather than cut\njobs and services in London.\nKen 'failed dramatically'\nWhen questioned, he stressed\nthat this is not an economic\npolicy he would choose\nno fm ally, but a lesser evil than\nhigher unemployment and poor\nhousing and other services.\nMr Livingstone claimed that\nalthough the Parliamentary\nLabour Party is weak, there is a great and increasing level of local\nsocialist activity; he predicted a sudden emergence of support for\nsocialism and reaction against\nthe present Government, which\nreaction, he said, will begin\nbefore the end of this year.\nThe meeting closed after a number of questions from the\nfloor, and a collection was taken\nin aid of striking miners' families.\nNHS saved\n% WAS fJ S1 t>o, ti&\nMy ToS A so^ ry\noff icc fK XT\ntcM PuTT gtV t>x Scl lt:7 \u00a3]\nWith only thirteen attending last\nThursday's event,Mark Glendenning (Chairman of the rightwing controlled Federation Of\nConservative Students) proposed\nthe motion 'This house believes\nin privatisation of the NHS'.\nGlendenning claimed that the\nformulas currently used to\nallocate funds for health\nspending between different\nsectors were in equable. He also\ncriticised the organisation of the\nNHS, stating that it worked 'first\nand foremost in v he interests of\nthe middle class administrators'.\nFurthermore he complained of\nthe high proportion of health\nspending devoted to paying\nwages; he believed that more\nspending is needed on equipment\nsuch as CAT scanners and\ndialysis machines, by reducing\nwages. Mr Glendenning,\nfollowing current fcs policy,\nblamed these problems on the\nfact that the NHS does not have\nto compete for patients, and\nproposed a system where\neverybody would be issued with\nvouchers which they would be\nfree to spend on treatment either\nat an NHS hospital or a private\none.\nThe oppose r, Peter Morris,\nfrom The National Union Of\nPublic Employees, began by\nnumerous cases where health\nauthorities have found\ncontractors for cleaning, laundry\nand other hospital services\nexpensive and inadequate. He\nsaid that competition between\ncontractors resulted in the\nrecruitment of poor quality\nlabour,uncommitted to the\njob.Following this argument, Mr\nMorris defended high spending\non wages in the NHS, saying thai\nwell qualified health workers are\nthe most important component\nof treatment.\nAfter contributions from the\nfloor, the motion was defeated by\neleven votes to one.\nHealth\nadvice\nfor\nforeign\ntravel\ni The Health Centre can provide\nim munis ation and health advice\nfor people travelling abroad.\nEven for people who have lived\nfor long periods abroad,\nparticularly in tropical countries,\nit may be appropriate to have\nsome im munis at ions or to take\nanti-malarial s, since immunity to\ndiseases may have diminished\nduring a stay in the UK.\nThe Health Centre emphasise\nthat it is important to visit the\ncentre well in advance of\ntravelling as some courses of\ntreatment take six weeks to\ncomplete.\nImmunisation clinics are held\non Monday, Wednesday and\nFriday between 2.30 and 3.30pm Oft wAS Ti\\\u00a3\n5 \u00a9 cK S in Yoot,\nft oo A Tec 6.

    "content": "CPROFILE\nMike Osborne\nThis week Hugh Southey takes a look\nat the president of the Royal School of\nMines, the smallest and most\ncontroversial of the CCUS.\nMike Osborne is different from the other two\nCCU presidents. For a start he was\nunopposed when he ran for Mines President,\nwhile both Maribel and Ann were 'anti-hack'\ncandidates running against 'hack'\ncandidates. Mike is also the only one of this\nyear'sC CU presidents who bear any\nresemblance to their stereotype in any way.\nHe is very definitely the sort of well built,\nclean cut, rugby playing ex-public school boy\nthat one expects to run RSMU. He also has\nthe sort of quiet self confidence that makes\nhim a natural leader. When interviewing him I felt there was not a question I could ask him\nthat would disturb his calm.\nRSM rugby club was Mike's first contact\nwith Mines' union. He was vice-captain and\ntreasurer of the club last year. Although he\nheld no Union post until this year, he has\nalways been involved; as he put it, 'I 've\nalways been very involved in the Union. I 've\nalways enjoyed the company of those\ninvolved in the Union although I wouldn't call\nmyself a hack, because they don't exist in\nRSM'.\nThis year has not in Mike's view been one\nfor major new initiatives. Mines' Union hasn't changed a great deal although Mike does\nbelieve that the typical Miner may be\nchanging. In his view students may be\nbecoming quieter because of higher\nentrance requirements.\n'Stuff it Rector'\nThe only major things that have happened\nin RSM this year have been the cancellation\nof Hon Porn Night and of the South African\nbar night. Hon Porn Night was cancelled after\nthe Rector called Mike, Ian Bull and the\nHonorable Pornographer into his office on\nthe night of the event. As Mike put it 'The\nRector is a very tricky, experienced\npolitician, much more tricky and\nexperienced than anyone else in College. I had my back to the wall. It was easy for\npeople to say, when I came out, that I should\nhave s aid 'OK, stuff it Rector' but I was in that\nmeeting and it was only the decision I felt I could make. I sometimes feel that the Rector\nput the shit on me rather than on himself. He\ndidn't put himself in a bad name. He didn't put the Dean of the RSM, Ted Brown, in a bad name. He took the shit right down lower\nthan that, right to myself. Obviously some of\nthe members of the RSM were shocked.\nHowever once I explained myself to the\nRSM, the RSM was totally behind my\ndecision'. He criticised the people who\ndisrupted the event saying that they were\noverturned the democratic decision of a UGM by contacting the press and militants\nat other colleges.\nMike believes that Hon Porn Night is\nunlikely to take place on campus next year. It\nwill take place somewhere though because\n'Our argument is that we are not\npornographic dealers, we are just there to\nhave a boys night out. lt happens at every\nRugby club and college in the country. Here\nit got into the press. That has all been a bit\nunfortunate. However it goes on\neverywhere. If the boys want to enjoy\nthemselves, the boys will enjoy themselves. I enjoy myself and have a good night out'.\nApartheid\nThe South African bar night was also\ncancelled following threats of a mass picket\nby students from other colleges. Mines\ndefended their bar night by saying that they\nalways held as part of their foreign student's week, a bar night which had a country in\nwhich they worked as a theme. In the past\nthey had held an Australian bar night. However, is it right for RSM students to take\njobs in South Africa? 'At the moment the\nNational Coal Board, in this country, doesn't hold a great future for the mining engineer.\nThey are not taking on a great deal of people.\nSouth Africa, at the moment, is, the only\nWednesday 20 March 1985\nother place we can work. It is highly unlikely\nwe can get work permits to work anywhere\nelse. I'd love to work in Australia. I spent my\nsecond year vacation in Queensland and\nthoroughly enjoyed myself. I liked the\nAustralian way of working and their way of\nsocial ising, but that is totally closed because\nof the lack of work permits. North America is\nthe same. Canada much the same. I'm prepared to work in South Africa because\nI'm totally committed to production mining\nwhich after three years on a mining course\nnot everyone is. I'm open minded enough to\ngo to South Africa. I don't feel that the\nargument that going to South Africa\nsupports Apartheid holds a lot of weight. I'm not supporting Apartheid I'm supporting\nmyself and my career opportunities'.\nBlock vote\nOver the past four years Mines have been\nable to defend these attitudes at UGMs by\nmobil ising the Mines block vote. Something\nthat has caused a lot of controversy within\nIC. Mike doesn't believe the block vote is\nundemocratic 'Mines is the smallest CCU by\na long shot. We make it known when the\nright of Mines needs defending, be it against\nsomething serious or something stupid like\nthe selling of South African oranges in the\nshops. We make it clear that we would like\nthe block vote mobilised. I think it is a fine\nthing when a college of between 500-600\nstudents can muster between 200-300 people\nto go along to a UGM which is more than\nusually go to a UGM anyway. It is a fine\ndisplay of the spirit within the RSM. You get\npeople going along who you have rarely seen\nbefore but they come along to defend the\nRoyal School of Mines. The Royal School of\nMines is an institution amongst the students\nand it's an institution amongst the mining\nindustry around the world. We'll always\nargue that we are the finest mining college in\nthe world and I 'll always support that\nwherever I go'.\nPersonally Mike has found the year as\nPresident en oromo us ly enjoyable. It has also\ntaught him to organise his time properly so\nthat his academic work hasn't been affected\nby his Union commitments.'I watch very little\ntelevision. If I'm sitting on my bum half an\nhour I go and do something'. He feels his year\nhas brought him into closer contact with\nmembers of staff and all students.\nNext year Mike wants to work\nunderground, probably in South Africa so\nthat he can gain the experience to take\nsupervisory positions in mining as soon as\npossible.\nFELIX\n\n"

The Wellcome Museum of Medicine\nmay not seem an interesting place to spend a Wednesday afternoon, but appearances can\nbe deceptive.\nAfter climbing what appears to be 1000\nflights of stairs you arrive, exhausted, at the\nWellcome Museum. The exhibition kicks off\nin classic style, with an interesting picture of\nsome neanderthal man performing brain\nsurgery with a flint axe. The exhibits are\nalternately quaint and gruesome. One\nmoment a bizzar e machine for producing 'Ye\nOlde Healinge Vapours', next an obscene\nglass case full of restraints for mental patients\ndesigned in the nineteenth century.\nOne or two of the exhibits deserve a special\nmention. 'Mr Gibson's Chemist Shop' is a superb 1903 chemists, perfectly preserved\nand full of patent medicines with tacky\nslogans. An iron lung proved the most\nharrowing exhibit. Comedians make jokes\nabout iron lungs, but until you have actually\nseen one, with a wax dummy trapped inside\nit, you can not appreciate what life inside an\niron g lung is like. Did I say a wax dummy? It\ncould have been a live human being for all the\nmovement possible.\nThe exhibition does not concern itself\nsolely with 'Western' medicine. Witchcraft,\nvoodoo and mummification techniques all\nhave their place in medical history alongside\nleeches. Rather like an art gallery, where one\nof the pieces may be made from ordinary\nhousehold objects, many of the exhibits in the\nWellcome Museum seem at first\nincongruously normal and modern. A'50p for a packet of 3' contraceptive machine\nstands just ten yards away from examples of\nthe kind of titanium plates that are used to\nrepair the skulls of bomb blast victims.\nThe Wellcome museum section of the\nScience Museum seems at first glance more\nlike a MacDonalds Burger Bar than a dusty-old museum with flashy doors and\nat mosh p eric lighting. It is a gres siv ely interesting, and every effort has been made to\ndraw parallels between now and the past. It is\nlively, treats the visitor as a mature human\nbeing and most of all has nothing whatsoever\nto do with your course. The only criticism\ncould be that sometimes the lig ting level is\ntoo low to be able to see the labels on the\nexhibits. Other than that, very little can be\nsaid other than take a walk down Exhibition\nRoad.\nIron Duke\nOn April 3 a historic event will take place in\nKensington Gardens in front of the Albert\nMemorial: for the first time this century a broad gauge train will run. It will consist of a locomotive tender and two carriages.\nThe locomotive concerned is 'Iron Duke',\na full size replica of an Iron Duke class\nlocomotive constructed for the Science\nMuseum as part of the celebrations of the\n150th anniversary of the Great Western\nRailway. Appropriately the naming\nceremony will be performed by the present\nDuke of Wellington, and will be performed at\n12 noon. Working demonstration will take\nplace that afternoon from 2.00pm to 5.00pm and also during the period 4\u20149 April from\n10.30am to 5.00pm The broad gauge was 7ft0 l/4in and was\nabolished in one weekend during May 1892\nwith all GWR track becoming standard\ngauge (4ft8 l/2in). The Iron Duke class was\nthe mainstay of the broad gauge express\nlocomotive fleet and was so successful that\nalthough originally designed in 1847 a second\nbatch was constructed in 1871-1888.\nThree broad gauge locomotives were\npreserved but the two stored at Swindon\nLocomotive Works (North Star and Lord of\nthe Isles) were dismantled early this century\nin order to increase the space available for\nlocomotive maintain ance and construction.\nIn 1935 North Star was rebuilt using as many\noriginal parts as possible for the GWR\ncentenary celebrations and is still kept at\nSwindon Works. The third locomotive was\nTiny which after languishing on Newton\nAbbott station for many years has been\npassed to preservation is ts. Even today the broad gauge affects British\nRailways (Western Region). It was because\nthe Paddington\u2014Penzance line had been\nengineered with broad gau age clearances\nthat the HSTs were first proven on that\nroute. Also if you look at the track work between the platforms at Paddington you will\nsee that it is still constructed in the broad\ngauge fashion of Baulk Road\u2014with timbers,\ncalled bau lk s, laid lenght ways continuously\nunder the rails and the gauge maintained by\ncross braces called transoms in place of\nsleepers.\nIt is proposed that after taking part in the\ncelebration this year that the locomotives will\nfind a permanent home in the National\nRailway Museum at York although it is\nrumoured that it may be permanently loaned\nto the Great Western Society centre at\nDidcot where a mixed gauge branch line is\npresently under construction using\nauthentic broad gauge rails.\nThe Railway Museum at York is an\n'outstation' of the Science Museum, London.\nFELIX Wednesday 20 March 1985 7\n\n"
