The plot surrounds a shooting at an all night diner and\nthe ensuing investigation by three\nLA policemen.\nThe film when it was released was\ncritically acclaimed, so here is your\nchance to see it on the largest\nscreen in Britain. Just answer the\nfollowing question:\nWhich Ex-Neighbour appears\nin LA Confidential?\nSo now you've read the reviews,\nnow it's time to win the chance to\ngo and see one of the films we've\ncast our beady eyes over this\nweek. Is it Cast Away you're pining to watch. Or perhaps you want\nto get hot under the collar with\nQuills?\nRegardless, our friends at the\nOdeon, High.Street Kensington\nhave kindly given us 2 pairs of\ntickets for one of these two films.\nYou and a friend could be rushing\ndown to see one of the most widely acclaimed films of the New\nYear, by answering this question:\nGeoffrey Rush played Philip,\nHenslowe in which 1 998\nromantic comedy?\nThe Kensington Odeon is located\njust on the corner of Earls Court\nRoad and High Street Kensington.\nRemember the special student\nrates they offer Imperial College\nstudents.\nAs usual send answers to all questions on these pages to\nfilm. felix@ ic.a c.uk by noon\nWednesday.\nCINEMA For those of you who have n't realised, Imperial College has its\nown cinema located in the Union\nConcert Hall on the second floor\nof the union building.

    "content": "Tremor Terror No More Earthquakes kill thousands every year and we\ncontinue onward from the devastation remorseful at the loss of life but maintain a sense that such things are out of our control.\nCertainly when my house fell to pieces during\nthe Northridge California earthquake of 1994 I came away from the experience with a feeling\nof resigned acceptance. After all, we can't predict this wrath of god sort of stuff... can\nwe? Well, physics researchers at Moscow State University are proposing that earthquakes do not have to be unpredictable any\nlonger.\nIn the 19th century an astronomer named\nDomenic Aragoe identified the polarization of\nsolar light reflecting off the surface of several\nplanets in our solar system. An interesting\nfind to be sure, but particularly fascinating was\nthe discovery by scientists in Moscow that the\npolarization of solar light reflecting off our very\nown planet can tell us about the geo-electric\nfield generated by the earth's plastic interior.\nHouse Destroyed in 1 9 9 4\nNorthridge, California Earthquake. The field fluctuates as movement within the\nplanet occurs, particularly in areas where earthquakes are imminent, and scientists in\nMoscow believed further analysis of the geo-electric field would eventually allow earth-quake prediction. The theory behind the\ndetection was rather simple. Some time\nbefore a quake occurs, redistribution of pressure takes place just below the Earth's crust.\nAs a result, in the area where redistribution is\nhappening surplus charges appear and the\ngeo-electric field shifts.\nmade by man. Densities more than 2 time,\n' Roll The San Andreas Fault Physics researchers started by suggesting\nthat to predict earthquakes it was enough to\nplace a number of monitors in quake prone\nareas which detect changes in the Earth's geo-electric field. In theory this would work, but\nunfortunately it is technically difficult and\ncostly. However, measuring changes in the\ngeo-electric field can be done by measuring\nchanges in the polarization of the solar light\nreflected from the surface of the Earth. The\npolarization always changes in the areas where\nintensity of the electric field increases. So, if\nyou can monitor the changing polarization of\nthe light reflected from different parts of the\nEarth and find the locations where it is shifting\nrapidly you can predict earthquakes.\nDense Stuff Smashing gold atoms together and looking at\nthe results is the activity which the scientists\nat the Brookhaven Heavy Ion Collider have\nbeen involved in lately. And the results? The\ncreation of the highest density matter ever\nhigher than those previously produced an,\ntemperatures of over 1 trillion degrees create!\nas the gold\natoms were blasted together.\nScientists believe that dense matter like th aik being formed in the collider existed a few mil'\nlion th s of a second after the Big Bang and are';\nthus useful\nin developing an understanding of our Jj\nverse's formation. They are also hopeful that\nthe violent collisions will break protons and l neutrons into their sub components, quarks and\"\ngluons, further revealing the mysterious inter!\nnal structure of nuclei.\nIn Search of;\nStardust Last Monday, soaring 3,700 miles above the southeastern coast of Africa, NASA'sj\nStardust spacecraft took it's closest flyby of'\nEarth.

    "content": "screen Cast Away Vertical Limit\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\nStarring: Tom Hanks and Helen\nHunt\nC huck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a FedEx systems engineer who\ntakes his job very seriously - much\nto the chagrin of his girlfriend Kelly\n(Helen Hunt). On one of his trips\nhis plane crashes, killing everyone\nelse on board and stranding him on\na remote island. Alone and\nstripped of all everyday conveniences he must first survive, and\nthen find a way to get back home.\nObviously much of the success of\nthe film lies on Tom Hanks shoulders. Here he confirms that he can\neffortlessly carry a film. He gives a very subtle performance, never\ngiving the audience the impression\nthat he is trying too hard. While on\nthe island he manages to sustain\ninterest over long periods where\nvery little happens. He also shows\na light comic touch reminiscent of\nhis earlier films (e.g. Big)\nThe big question though is\nwhether he'll win the best actor\nOscar. He has achieved the weight\nloss/gain, which is always a good\nsign and seems to be an academy\nfavourite. However, I don't think\nhis performance is showy enough\nto stand out to the academy.\nThe direction is very workmanlike\nand unemotional. This is sur pris ing, given that the man at the helm\nis Robert Zemeckis, responsible\nfor such warm and imaginative\nclassics as Back to the Future and\nForest Gump. It seems that in\nsplitting his attention between this\nand What Lies Beneath (which he\nshot while Tom Hanks was losing\nweight for the second half of the\nfilm). Subsequently hasn't put his\nheart into either.\nThe plot and character development is also poor. The relationship\nbetween Hanks and Helen Hunt is\nintroduced too quickly and in a heavy-handed way. There is no\neffort by the writer( William Broyles Jr.) to develop any character other than Hanks. This is\nsurprising given that he also penned the excellent Apollo 13 in\nwhich all the main characters were\nthree-dimensional. If not for Hanks'\nendearing performance Cast Away\nwould be average at best. If only\nthe whole film packed his emotional punch, then it would have been\nvery special.\nCastaway is in cinemas now.\nAamar\nDirector: Martin Campbell\nStarring: Chris O' Donnell, Bill\nPaxton and Robin Tunney\nT his is a film truly for the lowest\ncommon denominator; a film\nthat the stupidest people in the\nworld will enjoy whilst those with\nan ounce of intelligence will dismiss within ten seconds of the\nopening credits ending.\nThe storyline is based on a group\nof climbers who become stranded\nwhilst scaling the mountain K2. The team is led by a businessman\nwho is doing it as a publicity stunt\nfor his company. You know they\nare going to fail before they put\ntheir big furry socks on. Anyway,\nthe brother of one of the stranded\ndecides to launch a rescue mission\n\"for the sake of my sister and my\ndad\". Yes, it really is that clich ed. But get-this, they decide to use\nsome super du per form of nitroglycerine to blow them out of the\ncavern they are trapped in! For\nGod's sake, it doesn't take a chemist (which I am) to realise this\nisn'ta good idea. But the film continues plodding along, sincerely\nbelieving it could pull the wool over\nthe audience's eyes with this, possibly the most ridiculous proposition in movie history.\nVertical Limit has every clich e imaginable, and takes banality on\nto a whole new plane. If that was-n't enough, it smacks of American\nchauvinism, possibly the most infuriating characteristic of big modem\nHollywood films.\nIn addition, there are astonishing\nerrors. The climbers are at 26,000\nfeet yet their breath doesn't con-dense. The nitroglycerine explosive\nis luminous green! Not forgetting it\nreacts with light whilst in it's metal\ncontainer. This film, in parts, is\nem barras ingly laughable.\nGranted, the locations on the film\nare unbelievably beautiful and constitute its only redeeming quality-The cast are no better than\nmediocre, whilst Martin Campbell\nthe director, has lost the plot (pun\nintended) since his previous offerings of Golden Eye and Mask of\nZorro. By the end of the film, how-ever, when the characters are i down with pulmonary\ncoming for\noedema, you would be forgiven\nthinking that your in the local ear nose and throat hospital, a vl S,t t \u00b0\nwhich wo u Id probably be more\nthan watching Vertical Limit.\nVertical Limit is in cinemas no*\nOre\"\n22nd January 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

In the period of the presidency termed \"the eleventh hour\" Clinton,\nmuch to the chagrin of his conservative rivals, blasted into environmental action. In\nhis final week of office he created six new\nnational monuments. While technically not\nthe most heavily protected lands in the USA\n(national parks), national monuments are\nheavily covered by environmental safeguards\nand perhaps most importantly can be created\nthrough the simple process of presidential\ndecree. It is for this reason that more than\nI million acres of federal land in the west has\nsuddenly been thrown off limits to industry\nand developers.\nThese national monuments are only the final\nn i0Ves in a series of eleventh hour environmental decisions which Clinton has been\n^ a king. He has created the U.S. Virgin\nar|d Coral Reef National Monument, which\n'i clude s more than 1 2 , 0 0 0 acres of sub me r9ed lands within a three-mile belt off St.\nJ \u00b0nn> including Hurricane Hole and areas\nnorth and south of St. John.

However, Bush\nhas remained silent. The only commentary\nfrom his camp on these issues has come from\nhis spokesman Scott McClellan,\" We are\nreviewing all eleventh-hour executive orders,\nrules and regulations and will make decisions\nafter President elect Bush is sworn into\noffice. The president-elect believes in a balanced approach to our environment that is\nbased on working closely with states and\nlocal communities.\"\nA Mir six weeks\nThe Russian Government has set a date of\nMarch 6th for the destruction of the veteran\nMir space station. It follows an eventful fifteen years, including a variety of fires, crashes and computer fail iure s, and most recently\nall contact with the station was lost on\nChristmas Day. In recent years the Russians\nhave come under increasing pressure from\nNasa to scuttle the craft and concentrate\ntheir thin resources on the International\nSpace Station, Alpha.\nAn unmanned supply ship is due to dock with\nthe station today in order to refuel it,\nalthough Moscow are believed to have an\nemergency crew standing by in case the\nAIR salO\nautomatic docking does not go as planned. In\nMarch, the station's thrusters will be fired in\norder to take it down into the thicker atmosphere, where it is expected to break up. Most\nof the pieces should burn up in the atmosphere, with the larger ones expected to\nsplash down in the Pacific Ocean.\nHowever, there are few guarantees that the\noperation will go as planned. Russian scientists say that they are confident it will go\nahead without any faults, but the only comparable operation in Space history is the\nde orbiting of Sky lab in the 1 9 7 0 s, which\nresulted in an exhilarating few hours for\nmuch of the Southern Hemisphere, before\nthe Station finally hit part of the Australian\noutback.

    "content": "N0W LOOK' ER E!SL| MMA WALKER Firstly. In ave two words to say to post\ngraduates complaining about being financially impoverished ah did du ms.As undergraduates you had grants, didn't pay\ntuition fees and didn't graduate with an\naverage of \u00a3 1 0 , 0 0 0 debt. Yes, there are\nhalls of residence for you, and you aren't forced to pay private sector London rents\nfor two or three years if you couldn't get\none of about twenty re-applicant positions,\nlam aware that not all PG courses are\nfunded, but you are supposedly older and\nwiser than us. So then why did you chose\nto come to imperial fucking college. I wouldn't. Secondly (and this is why I dislike post-graduates) my course syllabus lied. It\nclaimed we have a variety of courses AMD have options in the third and fourth year.\nActually, what happens is that as we are a small year group (now numbering eleven),\nand the RS M( TH Huxley School) has sacked or is in the process of sacking most\nof its quality teaching staff we simply follow a group of MSc students around the\nbuilding. Our 'varied' co uses included the\nsame chemistry course for the third year in\na row because the MSc students haven't TOWN V COUNTRY? IAIN ANGUS Animal rights people seem to be one of the\nfe \u00ab groups of people that I can honestly\nsay that I have nothing in common with\nwhatsoever. I seem to be in the extreme minority around here but I'm from a small\nvillage in the Yorkshire countryside, enjoy\nst J ch hobbies as fishing and shooting and If eel obliged to stand up for the rights of\nthe\nPeople that these city dwelling activists target.\n(I don't know how the vote in parliament on\nfox hunting has gone yet but I would assume that MPs perceive that a majority\nof the voting population want rid of it and\nwi\" vote in accordance with that, ro gard'e ss of their own opinions and of their own\nLament about what's right or wrong),\nhe one main thing that Ilo a the about these animal rights, lets call them, ext rem done it before. Our valuable time was wasted on coursework containing mass balances no harder than a junior logic puzzle because the MSc s were confused. Our timetable is changed with less than twenty\nfour hours notice so the MSc students can\nhave preliminary lectures. I don't want to\nreally start on the lack of staff, but lets\njust say we did not have a third year coordinator until the last day of term.\nWe do technically have an option. We are\nrequired to do (on top of a twenty five hour lecture schedule and twenty hours minimum of assessed coursework a week)\nto do a humanities option. We can choose which humanities option. However we aren't given time to attend the course. Last term we chose our option and then\nfound as we had five/ six hours of\ntimetable lectures at lunchtime each week\nour classes had to be on obscure days or\ntimes. The lectures we could attend were on Friday lunchtimes. Now after commit ting to the 'option1, studying for the tests\nand agonising over the extra coursework, this term we have timetabled lectures on a Friday lunchtime. Still on the timetabling\nissue, I have a question for you all. Do you\nthink that lectures from 9 to 5 (with no\nlunch break) is reasonable for first years let\nalone third years with big projects,45 pieces of assessed coursework a week and\nThe lix is ts is that they place the welfare of animals above the welfare of people. To me,\npeople should be intrinsically more important to other people than animals. Acts of\nviolence against people or destroying their\nways of life is a far more heinous offence\nthan anything you could do to an animal.\nI'm not saying that unnecessary abuse of\nanimals is right, its just a question of prior-it y. In trying to ban fox hunting, the extremists\nhave picked an easy target. Fox hunting is\na country sport, which it has long been perceived to be mainly done by \"rich, upper\nclass snobs\". The never ending class war in\nthis hierarchy-marred country means that\nit is an easy task to drum up public support\nin the apparently downtrodden, \"holier than\nthou\" urban population. Never mind the\ncountry cousins of these downtrodden peoples, the people who have seen their\n9 to 5 lectures? This Tuesday we were supposed to have lectures9 to 1 2 , an\nexam (not test) 12 to 2 and lectures 2 to\nfive. Our Thursday afternoon this week is\nactually free, but it doesn't fit in with what\nthe MSc s are doing.\nWhy rant to us you say. That is my third\npoint. We have a staff student committee\nand dedicated year reps who attend meet-in gs. Nothing comes of our contribution to\nthese meetings. The only system that gave\nus notable responses from lectures was the old pink lecturer feedback forms. These now have been replaced with an\nunsuccessful internet version which does not include our department.\nSo that's why you're getting this.\nFinally, on a different subject, what is the\nobsession with wearing shoes in the show-ers and around the swimming pool? You are about to swallow X amount of diluted\nbeach which at least10 people( at an underestimate) have pissed in. Is foot hygiene really that important?\nPSI really like your edit io rials. Thankyou Summa, flattery will get you\neverywhere. In future articles will only be\nprinted if they contain at least one compliment -Ed\ntraditional sources of income evaporate, for one reason or another, and who depend in many areas on the lucrative country sports industry. Without this, they'd have\nnothing left and become a further burden\non our bloated welfare system. What worries me most of all, even more\nthan the brutal attacks on people, is that\nthese groups of violent nut cases won't stop. They won't stop until nobody in this\ncountry is allowed to eat meat. Their ideal\nsociety is one in which meat doesn't feature, they'll have ago at stag hunting, rough shooting, driven shooting, fishing\n(the most participated in sport in the co un try) and then finally meat.\nYou may support these people over fox\nhunting, fair enough - its your decision, but\nbe aware of what these people ultimately\nwant and ask yourself if this is what you\nwant too before you back them further.\nGot something to rant about? Send it to felix@ic.ac.uk.\nRants must be a maximum of 700 words and are printed at the Editor's discretion.\n* Felix \u2022 22nd January 2001 Letters\n\n"

The answer to the question \"What was the famous work of Karl Marx?\" was \"Das Kapital\". Due to the overwhelming amount of entries I decided to also allow the answer \"The Communist Manifesto\" (although that was a joint work with Friedrich Engels).

Thompson\nHunter S. Thompson has vowed never to write an autobiography, so these letters are the closest we will get to his\naccount of a life that stands as a testament to hard living and great journalism. Along with Ken Kesey and the late\nWilliam Burroughs, he takes a brickbat to the romantic notion of 'live fast, die young'.\nThis, the second monster volume of letters, covers the juiciest of years. 1970: Thompson runs for Sheriff of Aspen\non a platform that includes the Sheriff's right to take mescaline 'whenever it's Right' - and loses narrowly. 1971: the\nMint 400 motorcycle race that became the lurid, unforgettable Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. 1972: the NixonMcGovern Presidential election.\nSo the letters - to friends, enemies, editors and agents - fill in the gaps not just of 'Las Vegas', but also 'Fear and\nLoathing on the Campaign Trail' and the 'Great Shark Hunt1\ncollection - Thompson's three stone-classic books. As well as showing the birth of alter-ego Raoul Duke, and the germination of the Gonzo style, they detail every tortured detour in Thompson's search for the Death of the American Dream. He eventually concludes that Richard\nNixon himself is the Death of the American Dream, though personally the revelation that the Las Vegas trip was\n|done entirely straight and sober comes pretty close. The more one reads, the more it becomes clear that, far from\na cartoon figure, Thompson is likely to be seen as a major literary figure of the 20th century. Outrageous and ego-maniacal, sure, but a committed and astute political observer. I put him somewhere between Thomas de Quincey\nand Samuel Johnson, whose quote stands of course as the epi graph to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: 'He who\ngets rid of the pain of being a man'. I'd say Thompson is more man than most.\n\u2022 Nix \u2022 22nd January 2001 Books\n\n"

Manic Depression\nLosing my mind\nY ou may not know how common it is, or how\nmany people our age suffer from it, but\nBipolar Disorder is damn serious and can take\nover every minute of your life, wreck your\ndegree, friendships, relationships, and even kill\nyou. I'm telling you my story in the hope some\nof you are going to recognise it and get help\nbefore it's too late.\nI can't really say when it started, but I'd go\nfor sometime around the age of 14. I was\nbright at school, and I suppose I still am, so I hardly noticed when I got \"high\". I'd just gradually get more and more energy and slowly work\nmyself into a frenzy. It was usually during\nhomework, or while doing some kind of exercise. I'd just fling myself into work and rush\nthrough it all like I was king of the world.\nSometimes it was useful, but being that hyper\nmeant I was prone to making some incredibly\nstupid mistakes. Running was a pretty good\nway of getting rid of all that surplus energy, but\nI also had a tendency to make stupid mistakes-not noticing loose paving stones and cars until\nthe last possible moment- I'm pretty surprised I rarely got hurt.\nI said bipolar, but I didn't call it that for years.\nOf course it had a downside, and it was deep\ndown, and it was fast. I'd just be slowing from a high, when I'd think about something bad, and\nget hooked on it. It could be something I'd said,\ndone, or even a shoelace undone (I'm not kid-ding). Suddenly this wave would just come\nover me, and just take over all my thoughts. It's Pretty difficult to explain a serious depression\n1 0\nsomeone who hasn't had one, but you can't pull yourself out of it\", it's like quicksand. It\ntakes you over; you suddenly feel the world's9 \u00b0ln\ng to end, listen to depressing music, stay in\ny \u00b0Ur room with the curtains drawn- you're just\nParalysed by this horrible black wave. I didn't fl\nsuicidal, but I was always terrified I would,\nPecai\nabout\n%. It\nuse I knew there was very little I could do\njt\n-1 went on like this until I got to uni ve red, li k Nothi\nand\nwas one of those things I took for grant-e having a headache or something.\nln9 I could do, just lie down, go for a walk\nIonS ta^ away fr or nP eo P'e unti' it: passed.\nPeriods of time would pass without anything happening, and I would assume it had\ngone away. I was always wrong. I just kept two\ntapes in my bag; \" Happy album\" and \" Sad songs\" and wallowed in a mood when necessary. It was only when I got to university that\nthings got more interesting. I had what's known\nas \"mixed manias\". Think of it this way; you've\ngot two dials \"mood\" and \"mood energy\". You\ncan have high mood and high energy (a high),\nlow mood and low energy (depressed), low\nenergy (mood ceases to exist- you get with-drawn, this is one mixed mania) and high energy and low mood. This is probably the most\ndangerous one and you can start doing and\nsaying absolutely crazy things. With me I discovered a fondness for hurting myself. I'd either start punching or flinging myself at solid\nobjects or people in clubs, or sit at home and\ndig sharp objects into my arm. It was only by\ncutting that I could really calm myself down and\nget some sleep, and I spent an eternity washing blood out of my sheets!\nBy the second year my mood swings were so\nfrequent I was having serious trouble going\nabout my daily life. I'd get obsessed with some\nidea- going running, going to the pub, cleaning\nout the fridge- but by the time I got ready to go\nI'd just suddenly crash again, and just sit in my\nroom and cry. I don't even want to think about\nhow my College work went down the pan.\nI only really realised I needed help when I went out with some friends and had a serious\nattack of the crazies. Fuelled by (some) al co hol, I was alternating between crying, with-drawn, enthusiastic and head butting walls\nevery five minutes. It didn't help that it was\nexam time- God knows how I passed. Soon after the exams I went to see a psychiatrist at\nthe Health Centre. I couldn't believe I was seeing a psychiatrist, but given what I'd been\nthrough in the past months I stopped caring.\nHe told me to read a book called An Unquiet\nMind by Kay Redfield Jamison. Although the\ntimescales vary (they can be anything from 4\nmood swings per year to four per day), it was\njust like a page out of my life. So there it was,\nin black and white; \"Bipolar Affective Disorder\ntype II with ultra-rapid cycling).He put me on a mood stabilise r. which made me really tired at\nfirst, meant I couldn't drink and made me\nembarrassingly clumsy for a few weeks. I was\non the verge of giving up when I first felt what\nshould have been a horrible wave of depression\non holiday, but somehow it was more gentle.\nAfter a few months of upping the dose I was\nstill getting depressed, and eventually they put\nme on an antidepressant, which seems to be\nkicking in now. I still have to go for therapy\nevery week, which is a bit embarrassing, but\nit's nice to be able to sound off about my\nstresses once a week.\nHere's the facts; about 1 % of the population\nare believed to suffer from manic depression\n(or bipolar disorder as doctors call it). It mostly\naffects the most talented and intelligent pe o ple, and has done throughout history. For\nexample, I was at a Van Gogh exhibition\nrecently, and it was fascinating to see his\nmoods. We had his painting \"manias\" where\nhe'd churn out a dozen bright yellow pictures in\na month, and his depressions, where he'd produce one sad, brown and red introspective self\nportrait in a year. The tragedy is, it's relatively\neasy to treat- there was no need for his life to\nbe destroyed by his bleak moods, self-harm\nand eventual death if he'd been alive today.\nI think you could argue that I haven't been\nexactly com pos for about the last four years.\nAll I can remember about a lot things that happened in my life involve loads of time spent\ngoing up and down all the time I think I wrecked a lot of my teens because of it. I can't help but wonder what my life would be like if I'd got help years ago. I'm pretty certain of one\nthing though, if I hadn't got help when I did, I wouldn't be around to write this.\nI 'll leave you with this thought. If 1% of the\ncountry have this, that means 100 people are\nthinking very deeply right now. It's probably\neven more, because Imperial students are\nmore intelligent and creative, so more prone to\nit. But you don't have to go through all this any\nmore. You can get your life back.\nEd's note: All articles in this series are\nanonymous, but you can contact the author\nthrough Felix.

    "content": "rE a\"N___ KNOW Shock over Iranian prison sentences MARIAM GH ORB ANNE J A DOn Saturday 13th of January, harsh sentences were handed out to seven prominent journalists and intellectuals in Iran. The\nruling is a major setback for the Iranian\nreformist movement and the liberal President, Mohammad Khatami. He is now\nreconsidering a decision he announced back\nin the summer to stand for re-election in the\nforthcoming June elections.\nThese pro-reformists, leading supporters\nof Khatami, travelled from Tehran to participate in the Berlin Conference last April, which was sponsored by a foundation connected with the Ger mar Green party. It was viewed as a chance tc\ngauge the political anc\nsocial situation in Iran; tc\ndiscover whether there\nhad been any sign if i can changes since las February's general elections, which had seer wide scale victory fo Iranian reformists.\nHowever a group o Iranian exiles, believed t( be from a radical com mu nist faction, interrupted\nthe proceedings. They were allowed time to give their opinion but persisted in making a noise and causing general disruption, which\nled to the conference being broken up.\nTwo days later, Iranian state television\nbroadcast the hecklers' speeches, which\nattacked the Islamic system. This caused outrage with more than 140 members of the\nIranian parliament labelling the conference as\n'counter-revolutionary' and insulting to the\nIranian nation. They called on the Iranian\njudiciary to punish the Iranians who had\nattended the conference in Berlin. Right-wing\nnewspapers were quick to add their own con-dem nation, saying they had committed treason by consorting with the enemies of the\nregime. Reformists too were angered by the\nbroadcast, claiming the conservative run\nstate television were trying to create conditions making it impossible for the new parliament to do its work.\nCampaigning journalist, Akbar Ganj i, received the most severe sentence; 10 years\nimprisonment followed by five years internal\nexile at Bashar gad, a remote desert area.\nDuring the course of his investigation, he uncovered high-level involvement in the murders of dissident Iranian intellectuals, going\nso far as to name some of the alleged culprits in court. So he had many powerful ene-,\nmies in Iran, A similar sentence was dealt to\nSaeed Sadr, a translator at the German embassy in Tehran on charges of 'moh are beh1 President Khatami, left, and right, Ayatollah Khamenei\n( making war against the Islamic system ).\nFellow translator, Khalil Rostamkhani, was given nine years, eight of which were on\ncharges of ' moh are beh'. Also receiving a lengthy prison term was Ali Afshari, leader of\nthe biggest student organization in Iran ( the\nUnity Consolidation Bureau ) who got five\nyears. Just six of the seventeen people tried\nwere acquitted, while those convicted have\n20 clays to appeal.\nThe prison sentences were much worse than expected and have put the internal division present in Iran in the spotlight again.\nDeputy speaker of parliament, Mohammad Reza Khatami( brother of President Mohammad Khatami ) commented, 'Those\npeople... did not commit a crime, and their\ntreatment by the judiciary was wholly factional and politically motivated.' Germany's reaction was one of deep concern and the\nIranian ambassador to Berlin was summoned\nto the German Foreign Ministry, a day after\nthe sentences had been announced,\nMeanwhile Iranian Foreign Ministry\nspokesman, Hamid Reza As ef i, disagreed.\nHe said,1 any link between this trial of\nIranian citizens and relations between Iran\nand Germany is unacceptable and un reason able'. Some reports though are speculating\nthat Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's planned\nvisit to Tehran in the spring has been called\noff. The court's ruling may dam ge bilateral\nrelations between Germany and\nIran as well as\ncompounding Iran's international isolation.\nModerate President Mohammad Khatami had\nbeen trying to\nloosen the\nstrict Islamic\nlaws and social\nrestrictions which have been\nimposed since\nthe Islamic revolution of 1979 which saw the\nShiite clergy come to power. Although press\nfreedom has been improved, some newspapers expressing opposition to hardliners have\nbeen shut down by conservative clerics. But\nthe restrictive press law remains unchanged.\nThe difficulty the President faces in his\nattempts to reform the country is that\nalthough the reformists hold a majority in the\nIranian Parliament, the Supreme Leader\nMohammad Khamenei has the power to veto\nany laws being passed. He is a conservative\ncleric who has already managed to minimize\nmany hoped-for changes. It is feared that\nKhatami may not have the power to make his\nidea of a new, liberal Iran a reality.\nl^ Tp News \u2022 22nd January 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

    "content": "CL ABOUT Star Wars: Reviving the nuclear arms race( Pugwash Public Discussion 8/12/00) - Summarised by Maurice Pigaht meeting, Dr. Alexander Konovalov (President of the Institute for\nDuring the cold war, the US horrified the world with it's dabbling in anti-nuclear missile technology, through the infamous SDI programme\nalso known as Star Wars. These defence systems were designed to shoot\ndown incoming ballistic missiles. Recently the US has revived these ambi-t ions, officially aimed at defending against so-called 'rogue states'. Such a system, however, would be catastrophic for international relations, particularly with Russia. It would also force China to increase its nuclear weapons\nstockpiles, so that they remain a deterrent. This in turn would trigger a response from India - wary of China - to respond by increasing its own\nnuclear arsenal.\nPakistan would then feel that it has no choice but to follow suit. Although\nthe US has temporarily put its current National Missile Defence (NMD)\nproject on hold due to technological difficulties, it is far from being abandoned. There was a fear in the 1970s that an American NM D system would render\nRussia's nuclear deterrent useless. This would spell out catastrophe for the\ndogma of nuclear deterrence (I don't destroy you because otherwise you'll\ndestroy me). The only option for Russia under these circumstances would\nappear to have been to attack the United States before this defence system\nwas completed. This is why the A BM treaty, signed in 1972 and a corner\nstone of nuclear relations, limits NM D systems on both sides.\nOf course, as usual there is a loophole. Both sides were permitted to cancel\nthe treaty, giving 6 months notice. The US has not done this yet and does\nnot even seem convinced of the necessity to do so before violating its treaty\ncommitments, although it would seriously threaten US-Russian relations.\nOn the 8th December British Pugwash (Conferences on Science and World\nAffairs) held a Public Discussion Meeting on American NM D plans. At this\nStrategic\nAssessments, Moscow) pointed out that the real threats to the United\nStates are not addressed by NM D. These are nuclear but also (and prof c,a. bly more likely) biological weapons being delivered by: Smuggling a war-head, short-range cruise missiles, civilian aircraft, small ships and finally\nInter-Continental Ballistic Missiles. Only the last of these could be inter,\nc ep ted by the suggested NM D system. Clearly this is a major draw-back}\nit is to be used against 'rogue' or terrorist attacks. Even Air Marshall Sir\nTimothy Garden, also speaking at the meeting, considered the project 'pour-ing\nmoney down the drain', pointing out the potential of far more effective projects in furtherance of international security through diplomacy. He also stated that, as NM D would be ineffective against Russia's huge arsenal or\n'rogue' and terrorist attacks, it can only be seen as targeted against China.\nThis, he pointed out, was far from helpful to international relations and security, or indeed to the regional situation between China, India and Pakistan.\nThe ineffectiveness of NM D was further underlined by Richard Garwin\n(Formerly Prof of Public Policy, Harvard University). He described simple\ncountermeasures, such as deploying recoils (a simple balloon will do) and/or\nmultiple warheads would undermine the system. Furthermore, NM D would\nnot be useful against biological weapons as they can be delivered in small\nbomb droplets.\nThe consequences of NM D are clearly far from trivial. The dangers of\nNuclear Weapons, although part of a topic going out of fashion, entail the\ndeath of millions of innocent people, and environmental contamination on an\nunrivalled scale.\nFor more information or to be kept informed about future Student Pugwash\n( Science, Ethics& World Affairs) events contact StudentPugwash@ic.ac.uk or Maurice.Pigaht\u00ae ic.ac.uk\nwy i http://www.download.com:\nYou will find everything you need to download from utilities to games,\nwhether for a Mac or aPC( and yes, you can download win zip in case a modern institution such as IC does not provide your computer with power zip). http://v our wallpaper. com/index.html:\nA nice website featuring a good selection of wallpapers (movies, pop culture, sport...).

With Willis Jackson Hall due to be\nj closed as part of the rolling refurbishment in\nEvelyn Gardens, and Beit Hall due to reopen\nthis Summer following its troubled refurbish-ment, there was a very real possibility that\nthere would not be enough hall space next\nyear to go round. The problem was only\nsolved this year by keeping Willis Jackson\nopen for another year and sharing the\nremaining first years between Wilson House\nin Notting Hill and Clayponds Village, Ealing\n(Felix 1182).\nHowever, senior College sources privately\nadmitted that the decision was also heavily influenced by lack of money for the project. The rede-velo pm ent's price, estimated as \"tens of millions\"\nis heavily increased by the fact that Southside is a grade 2 listed building, and any development\nwould have to fit in with surrounding buildings.\nThis ruled out complete demolition, as the College\nwould only get permission for a four-storey building in future, seriously limiting the number of\nrooms.\nUnion sources described the decision was\n\"unfortunate but necessary\", with President\nHamish Common adding that College \"had no\nIn brief STRATEGIC MOVE Dr Christopher Towler has been named as\nCollege's new Director of Strategy Development, and will work directly under\nthe Rector in controlling strategy in certain\nareas.

For\nthis many to make-ends-meet there had to be\nsomething to this scuba lark and lurking\nbeneath those crystal waters there must\nhave been some sights worth my scrutiny.\nI eventually selected an instructor and dive\nshop for my open water course. I'm sure my\nmother would have wanted me to rake\nup the past of every instructor, searching for long forgotten mis demean ours but at the end of the day, when it came\nto it, I trusted my gut instinct.

Dear Felix,\nJust a quick correction on the cinema theft (Felix News, 17th Jan)at the moment it looks as though\nthe money that was in cinema's stolen safe will be covered by our\ninsurance (though this has not yet\nbeen confirmed).\nHowever, if the insurance policy\nhadn't covered thefts of money\nthen the Union would not have\nrefunded the loss - this is because\nthe money should have been put in\nthe bank the morning after the all-night er, but was instead left in the\nsafe over the entire Christmas vacation. This is a serious breach\nof financial procedures and is\nbeing dealt with accordingly.\nCan I therefore take this opportunity to remind everyone who handles club & society money( whether it be membership subscriptions or other sorts of income)\nthat all cash should be deposited\nin the bank as soon as\npossible - the income form for the\nFinance Office can follow along\nlater, but to save yourself the\nem baras s ment of having all your\nclub's membership subscriptions\nstolen (naming no names...) just\nget the cash out of your sock drawer and into the Nat West bank.\nThank you!\nEtienne pollard\nDeputy President\n(Finance & Services)\nImperial College Union\nThanks, looks like I'd better bank\nthat \u00a312,000 I 've got stashed\naway- Ed\nDELUGE& SLIDING MUD Dear Felix,\nI would like to counter M. Ali\nChoudry's character is ation of climate change (\"Praise be to Global\nWarming?\", Felix 1192) as a problem not worth getting worked up\nover. In this he parts company\nwith even BP and Shell, who now\nsupport carbon-reduction efforts.\nThough Mr. Chou dry plays up\nuncertainties over whether or not\nwarming has occurred in the past\ncentury, the important question is\nwhether warming will occur in the\nnext. Most evidence in fact suggests that warming should not\nyet be detectable, but will accelerate in the\ncoming decades.\nMr. Choudry also contends that\nwarming predictions have been\ndeclining with better models, implying that doubtless the problem will all go away when we know\nmore. Unfortunately, warming is\nonly one aspect -- for example,\nsome models show less warming\nyet predict greater effects on\nanother dimension such as rainfall,\nwhich might be equally cat as troph ic.\nMost worrying, however, is Mr.\nChoudry's perverse equating of\nthe positive effects of clubbing in\nTorquay with the negative effects\nof mass famine and flooding in\nBangladesh. His rosy economic\npicture of lower housing and clothing bills also fails to include the\ncosts of malaria, cholera, and\ntropical crop pests spreading through Europe, increases in\nsevere storms (which caused 250\nbillion pounds of damage over the\npast decade), and heat waves and\nwater shortages.\nFinally, limiting carbon emissions\nneed not damage the economy. A U.S. Dept. of Energy study showed that simply encouraging\ngreater energy efficiency could\ncut emissions by a third while also\nsaving billions on energy ex pens es. The Economist agrees that\naction must be taken now as the\ncost will only increase later. And if\nthe bill is put off until later, guess\nwho will be paying it? That's plenty enough reason for today's students to be concerned about climate change now.\nTheodore Hong\nComputing\nCAN SOMEONE WRITE SOME DECENT LETTERS?\nDear Felix,\nThanks very much to last week's correspondent who suggested the\nrevolutionary idea of a revolving\nrestaurant on top of the Queen's Tower. Here in the Estates devi-sion we are always on the lookout\nfor new and original ideas for how\nto improve the College en v iron ment.

After a lengthy\nbreak and only a friendly with the\nfirsts, from which it was difficult to\ndraw conclusions, to whip us into\nshape, this was a solid and reassuring victory.\nUniversity College had the\nupper hand in the early exchanges,\na fast centre forward and a well\ndrilled midfield had a lot of the\nplay as we found it difficult to gel\nas a unit. For all their early pre s sure, UCL had nothing to show for\nit as the IC seconds began to\nrealise that they had a game on\nand got into gear. We started a few promising attacks, using the\nwings to bypass their strong centre but couldn't string a scoring\nmove together.\nThe first goal was a tonic for\nour lethargy. (A somewhat hun-g over) lain saw a gap and made a burst into the box but was cynically floored by the opposition's defense. Controversially, the referee adjudged that the original\nfoul had been committed on the\nedge of the area and awarded us a free kick rather than the blatant\npenalty (even though I landed far\nbeyond the penalty spot!). This\nwas all academic however as\"... curled the\nball into the\nfar bottom\ncorner.\nMagic took the kick and curled the\nball into the far bottom corner and\nunder the flailing keeper's body.\nOne nil it stayed until half\ntime, neither side doing anything\nof significance in a close and t etc hy period of play with only a couple of half chances at each\nend. Brad came off for Dave and\nMark came on to bolster the mid-field.\nThings continued the way they\nhad left off for the early part of\nthe second half but as UCL became more and more des per ate, they pushed forward increasingly and chances came in hard\nand fast at both ends. Last ditch\ntackling from \"Bruce\" Lee Barry\nand Fumex and some sensational\nsaves from JP( \"What a save JPi\")\nkept us in it. Lee made sure that\npeople as far afield as Cornwall\nknew that it was his ball.\nAt the other end, Dave and\nEniola really should have done\nbetter with a couple of chances\nbut at least we got a second from|\n\"What a save JP!!!\"\na corner. It went long but Dave,\nheaded it back into the danger]\narea and the ball was bundled in\nby J. After this, we had everything\nthrown at us but they only mana ged to score deep into injury\ntime, direct from a free kick.\nMagic was unlucky that it was a little too high for him at h te fai\npost and it went in off his head.\nHowever, it was too little too late\nand the IC boys had the hard'\nfought for win.\n- lain\nLadies Basketball& Rugby Women's Basketball\nImperial - 36 QM W29We won!

    "content": "On the head An Imperial researcher could soon have big news for the world's beer\ndrinkers\nRIK EDWARD ST he most important research to come out of\nImperial since the pyramid teabag could be\non its way if a Chemical Engineering PhD stu-dent's work is successful.\nNeil Hepworth has received funding from\nBrewing Research International and the Biotechnology Research Council in order to\nlook at the factors which determine how long it\ntakes a pint of beer to settle. Beer can often\nappear cloudy when poured from a keg due to\nthe formation of nitrogen micro bubbles, a high\nproportion of which can be stable, meaning that\nthe beer remains cloudy and unappealing. According to Mr Hepworth, the \"gas liquid dispersion characteristics\" are little understood,\nand his project involves \"understanding why\nbubble haze is formed and predicting its presence or absence\".\nPress uri sed gas is used to deliver some beers to the tap, and carbon dioxide was used\nin the past. However, for some ales, a COg and\nN2 mixture is used.\nNitrogen is substantially less soluble than\ncarbon dioxide, however,\nsome still dissolves in the\nliquid, forming these micro bubbles. M rH epworth noted that the composition of\nthe gas does not seem to\naffect the \" haze dura-tion\" during which bubbles are formed.

Mr Hepworth is hoping to\nuse this equipment to construct a comprehensive model of bubble haze, allowing its behaviour to be predicted in \"any given conditions\"\nThe research is necessary because industry!\nmethods to determine the behaviour of bubbles!\nare case-specific, due to the empirical nature ol previous research.

    "content": "Quills Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\nDirector: Philip Kaufmann\nStarring: Geoffrey Rush, Michael\nCaine and Kate Winslet\nAs soon as I heard about Quills,\nI knew I was going to be in for\na treat. It takes no further than the\ncast list to see this film must be\nsomething slightly special. Firstly,\nwe have Geoffrey Rush, one of the\nmost acclaimed actors of current.\nHis depiction of Sir Francis Walsingham in Elizabeth was mas-te rful, whilst we must not forget\nShine, the story of a piano player,\nwhich earned him an Academy Award. Then we have Joaquin Phoenix, Kate Winslet, and finally,\nMichael Caine. Need I say more?\n^ush plays the Marquis de Sade,\n\"ho is detained in a mental asylum\n'n Post revolution France. Using a\"^'d( Winslet) he manages to\nS mu99le out his titillating stories to\nthe\nGeneral pu D li c, unbeknownst to\n\u2022he head of the institute, Coulmier\niP\nho enix). However, on the orders\n\"jr\nNapolean, Dr. Roy el Collard( Ca| ne) is ordered into the institute\n0 s top the Marquis from produces his novels, by any means nec-tar y.^u'\"s> for the most part, is im miner% enjoyable. The entire film\nrevolves around Rush and his port ray al of the Marquis. His\noverblown and exuberant interpretation is deliciously extrovert but\nnever over-the-top. The vivaciousness and raucousness he gives the\npart, essentially turns every other\ncharacter into a bit part. Caine also plays his role superbly; his\ncold, calculated bad guy perfectly\ncomplimenting Rush' s volatile flawed genius. Nonetheless, Phoenix and Winslet do not\nbecome totally overshadowed by\nthese two characters, but allow\nthem to shine without rendering\nthemselves totally insignificant.\nUnfortunately, the film falls short\nsolely because of its ending. Until\nthen, the film's nature is based on\nits bawdiness and sexual over-tones. This element of fun is taken\nunexpectedly from the film in the\nlast half hour and it becomes much\ndarker. However, the ending is\nrather too long winded and ultimately all the little parts of the film\nthat made it so intricate are tried\nto tie up in a way that is not necessary and essentially makes a silly,\ndisappointing ending. Otherwise,\nthis would have been a five out of\nfive film.\nQuills is in cinemas now. Drew\nDirector: Ang Lee\nStarring: Yun-Fat Chow, Michelle\nYeoh and Ziyi Zhang\n'm tempted to just fill this review\nwith the following line repeated\nover and over again: \"Go watch\nthis movie right now!\" But somehow I don't think that constitutes a review. But maybe that's just the\nway to see this movie, without\nknowing anything about it, so that\nit creeps up on you and slowly\ntakes hold over your senses. In\nfact, stop reading this review and\n\"Go watch this movie right now!\"\nThe plot is simple; it involves the\ntheft of an ancient sword, the\nGreen Destiny, and the interactions between two couples; Li Mu\nBai (Chow Yun Fat), the legendary\nwarrior and the previous owner of\nthe sword, and Yu Shu Lien( Michelle Yeoh), the woman whom\nhe secretly loves. The other couple\nare played by Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi),\nthe headstrong daughter of a min-is ter, and the desert bandit Lo\n( Chen Chang). Essentially the\nstory revolves around the\nrepressed feelings between Li Mu\nBai and Shu Lien, and the illicit\nlove affair between Jen and Lo.\nOh, and did I mention the martial\narts?\nThe first screening that I attended\nplayed to a full house of hardened\nfilm fans at the recent London Film\nFestival, and after a rooftop chase\nsequence ten minutes into the\nmovie, every person literally got\nup and applauded for half a minute, so thrilled were they by\nthis extraordinary sequence. And\nthat's just one of the sequences!\nThe acting is spot on, but 19-year-old Zhang Zi yi steals all her\nscenes as the feisty and stubborn\nJen Yu. Not only is she beautiful,\nbut she also conveys this aura of\nhaughtiness about her, that makes\nher even more understandably attractive to Lo. Praise has to duly\nbe showered on director Ang Lee.Yuen Wo Ping's( The Matrix)\nfight choreography has raised the\nstandard for fight sequences and\nmarried with Ang Lee's direction,\nis nothing short of breathtaking.\nThere is so much more to say\nabout this film that cannot be stated in just a few words. For anyone\nwary of subtitles, don't be. This\nfilm is a certainty for Best Foreign\nLanguage Picture, but in reality\nthe accolade it truly deserves is\nBest Picture.\nCT, HD is in cinemas now.

One of the\nmost hotly awaited dance CDs this\nyear has been the Clubbers Guide\nto 2001 compilation and with a collection of successful older siblings\n(2000, '99, etc), the quality of mixing and range of tracks was always\nbound to be good. The theme remains the same with a look to\nthe years up and coming tunes. Although several of the tracks will\nimmediately be familiar to the regular c lubber's ear, many of the\ntunes are as yet unreleased and\nsuggest an interesting if a little\npredictable near future of the House music scene. The first CD contains a funky, intelligent collection of beats including Rui Da Silver Touch me, Santos Camels,\nthe popular Joshua Ryan Pistol\nWhip, and some sure future classics like Cle p to maniacs All I do\nand the very dark but clever Schiller Glockenspiel.\nThe second CD is traditionally more upbeat with tracks like Storm Animal and Feel the Beat\nby Da rude and the futuristic sounding, teeth gnashing Lost Witness7 colours.

    "content": "EWS Geology on the rocks pears over teaching quality as lecturers go to balance books\n|tOM ANDERSON I ast Tuesday lunchtime over 100 Geology students\nL \u2014.filled a lecture theatre in order to voice their concerns about the offer of early retirement to seven key\nacademic staff and the resulting ramifications on the\ncourse and department. Speaking to them was first\nStephanie Dawson ( R SMU President), Emily Procter\n(Geology Dept Rep) and Eleanor Clifford (RSMU Vice\nPresident), and later Professor Beddington, head of the\nT.H. Huxley School, and other academic staff.\nThe seven staff were offered early retirement not only\nin an effort to cut costs but also to achieve a higher rating in an impending Research Assessment Exercise,\nwhich is critical to the amount of money that flows into\nthe department. The exercise begins on the 1st of\nApril, and not surprisingly the staff have to leave by\n31st of March. A letter was sent to the seven lecturers\nat the end of last year with the leaking of the information to the student body soon after.\nThe students gathered voiced concerns regarding the1 course, especially with regard to the lack of contingency plans. The most concerning issue is that the 11\nstaff involved are being coerced to leave by the\n|1st March 2001, particularly untimely, since;\nis in the middle of an academic year\nStudents were unsure whether they would be\nfe le to get advice during the exam peri-gig; and the resulting extra burden on their time. No replacements will be found for the seven and thus\nexisting academic staff will have to be involved in\nteaching. Whether they want to or not, or, of greater\nconcern to students, are capable seems to be of no\nimportance.\nT.H Huxley School was formed during 1998 with the\nfusion of the departments of Geology and Earth\nResource Engineering and the Centre for\nEnvironmental Technology. The two departments had\nover the years accumulated a deficit that was written\noff with the formation of the School, though since\n1998, a \u00a31.5 million loss has accumulated. Action to\ncorrect this has been forced by College's Management\nand Planning Group with the loss of academic staff\n(staff being the greatest expenditure of the College) in\naddition to the previous reductions in clerical and support staff and space saving measures.\nLater in the day, Imperial College Union Council entered into a long debate about what was occurring in\nthe School with one member describing the issue as\n^ ^ \" the most important paper in years.\" The debate\nwas marked by concerns that this would happen to\nother loss-making departments, especially after\n\u2022xj the Medical School redundancies last year. It was\nquestioned whether this would be a regular so lu tion, as that a number of departments are in deficit.\nFollowing this Council mandated its\nlo rh o^e^m Two ui d^eV d judi cat ed'f Z^n t wi\u00bb b^ nexT Sabbatical officers t0 exPlore a\" Ince the staff setting the exams and avenues to fight for the students\nping the courses may not be marking the papers. studying Geology to ensure their education is not dam-per e are several final year students with projects\nping supervised by one of the seven and these stu-fc its have been particularly worried. Dr. Worthington,\nIformer head of department for Geology (in pre-T.H. Pxley days), corrected Professor Beddingto\" over his\nIngestion of new projects being initiated, to inform\n(\"dents that another supervisor would be found. An\nPlitional worry is the loss of fieldwork supervisors.\nP second year students have a seven-week mapping\nP \u00b0j ect during the Summer vacation and the reduction\nf 'staff win mean few possible areas w j|| be covered.\nIa\nPpears though that even if the lecturers do leave,\nIntents may still see some of them next term and next\nfa r This is due to a 'buy back' scheme where the\nP'i red\" staff will return to teach for two days a week\nI Neatly reduced salaries, a move which Professor\nd| ngt on admitted \"was the oldest trick in the book.\"\nart from low student morale, staff also are being\nIc ted, with many unhappy about losing colleagues\naged in any way.\nThe overall impression given to students is that their\ndegrees are being jeo pardi sed due to financial mismanagement, which is not in their control. The situation in\nGeology highlights discrepancies in the funding of universities by the Government. Essentially if a department receives a high grading in a Research Evaluation\nAssessment it receives a large financial reward.\nHowever the quality of teaching does not provide any\nextra financial rewards. Thus inactive research staff\nlower the grade of the research assessment which in\nturn affects the finances of the departments. Therefore\n\"research inactive\" lecturers, despite maybe being\nexcellent teachers are the first to be sacrificed. This\nde scrip an cy highlights the situation in Universities\nacross the country, where Government funding methods indisputably show that research has become a financial priority above undergraduate studies.\nThe\ners\nSmertr\nrdf in ff gets dry ilk,\nMP \u00bb ls the attention\n\u2022 pi in one night\ni dvm onic \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nand\nana\nrts. but keep ' em oui new syndicated\nFelix 1195 Cover photograph: Jonas Lindsay\nFelix \u2022 22nd January 2001 News\n\n"

    "content": "I Winter blues\nDAVID ALLMAN It's winter and the weather is cold and wet.\nChristmas and New Year are over, and\nthere's a lot of work to do in this long spring\nterm. It's natural to sometimes feel down hearted under these circumstances. And it's understandable not to want to get out of bed\nsome mornings! (Recognise yourself here?)\nMost people feel like this from time to time.\nHowever, if you've been feeling miserable for\nseveral weeks, if you don't seem to be able to\nenjoy anything and have lost interest in your\ncourse and your social life, and if this feeling\ndoesn't seem to be shifting, it's possible that\nyou might be depressed. Depression is common within the student population, as it is\nwithin the population in general. And it's possible - and important - to do something about\nit.\nSome more questions. Are you eating much\nless or much more than usual? Do you feel\ntired for much of the time? Are you having\ndifficulty getting off to sleep, or do you wake\nup several times during the night, or unusually early, feeling tired and worrying? Are you\nhaving difficulty concentrating in lectures, or\nwhen you're studying? Are you wanting to\navoid contact with your friends? Are you feeling particularly critical of yourself? Is it a struggle to actually think, to work out what\nyou have to do, or to make decisions?\nIf you're experiencing some of these difficulties, it's important to talk to someone about it: depression can be a downward spiral involving - for some - feeling that it's not\nworth carrying on with the course, or indeed\n(for a small proportion of people) with your\nlife. Sometimes depressed people feel su ici dal, and sometimes depressed people kill\nthemselves. Clearly, it's vital to interrupt this\npattern. Although the last thing you might\nwant to do is to talk to someone about how\nyou're feeling, it's important that you do. You\nmight be imagining that you're the only person in the world feeling like this, and not cop-ing, but there are certainly other students\naround who will be feeling the same way, yet\nnot wanting to let anyone know about it.\nCollege might not seem to be a place where\nit feels OK to admit to not coping.\nIt's useful to consider the broader context\nin order to understand some people's experience of depression. Life for some students\nhas become significantly more stressful over\nthe past few years; you might have to work\nto support yourself through College and the\ncost of accommodation is high. Hence this is\nthe context within which you have to navigate\nthe demanding workload. You might be feeling disappointed that your experience at\nCollege isn't turning out to be what you had\nhoped for and expected. You might also be\nfeeling homesick; perhaps you're a long way\nfrom home which might be in a different country. If you're a mature student you might\nhave to juggle the responsibilities of childcare and domestic tasks along with perhaps\nthe academic challenge of returning to education after a period in employment. If you're\nslipping behind with course work and missing\nan increasing number of lectures, it's important to acknowledge this. Don't bury your\nhead in the sand. Talk to your personal tutor,\nsenior tutor, postgraduate tutor, or someone\nelse you feel you can approach in your department. If you have slipped a long way\nbehind, talk to someone anyway so that you\ncan work out a course of action to attend to\nyour situation.\nWho else can you contact if you're feeling\nlow? You could contact one of the College student counsellors, or a practice nurse or\ndoctor in the Health Centre.\nThe College Counsellors are David Allman,\nSarah Cooke and Vicky Jessup. David and\nSarah are based on the South Kensington campus. To arrange an appointment, they\ncan be contacted as follows:\nDavid - 15 Prince's Gardens, telephone 020 7594 9430 (internal extension49430), email d.allman@ ic.a c.uk Monday to Friday.\nSarah - Room G30, Royal School of Mines,\nt' f}( \u2022*?\u2022':\u2022' !\n:f tv ft.:'' l'l>' r' \u2022 ' .

    "content": "4\n: National Portrait Gallery\nOf all the galleries listed here, the\nNational Portrait Gallery has perhaps the most instant appeal; lying\naS it does, not with the actual\nworks or painters themselves, but\nrather the subject matter.\nThe appeal of the place is essentially that it is like a2D Madame\nTussaud's, with every famous historical figure you'd care to name\nstaring down at you from across\nthe centuries. If this scratches\nyour itch then it is well worth a visit, to see all the famous figures\nm their varied historical settings.\nA good site to check out prior to\ngoing is the Unusual Facts and\nFigures site on the website, so as\nyou don't miss the gallery's more\nesoteric paintings - such as one\nthe size of your thumbnail, a portrait of 400 people and a wide,\nsquat painting designed to be\nviewed as you walk towards it up\na corridor - very clever.\nThe 20th century is also well represented, although in recent times the\nfocus has shifted less from great\nthinkers and politicians and shifted\nmore toward pop and film stars.\nww.n pg. org.uk\n5\n: National Gallery\nA visit to the National involves b rav ln\n9 the tourists of Trafalgar Square\na\"d flocks of those bloody pigeons -^ut it is always steams up my wind ow s. A big big big gallery that has\nar9u ably the best collection in\nr \"ain, with a very good permanent\nex n|b it ion and a variety of tempo-^ ones in the Sainsbury wing.\nrac tic ally no great master you\ncould\nthe collect\nname is unrepresented, and\nof a gallery of the 21st century. The\npersonal audio guides, which are of\na very high standard, and don't just\nrepeat what it says by the paintings\n(like in the Tate Modern and other\nplaces I could mention).\nA fine piece of innovation is also\nthe Sainsbury Wing, which features\na unique \"micro gallery\". Here you\ncan locate your favourite pieces,\nand even plan and print out your\nown personal tour - by no means\nnecessary on a first visit, but a nice\nfeature nonetheless.\nhttp://www.national gallery. org.uk\n6: Tate Modern\nThis art behemoth on the South\nBank, in the shadow of St Paul's and opposite That Bridge, opened\nrelatively recently to great public\nacclaim. Converted from an old\npower station, it houses a massive\ncollection of modern art by artists\nsuch as Dali, Picasso, Matisse, and\nWarhol, has a wide range of people\ncoming to see it and the added distinction of being free.\nYou don't have to be into art (what-ever that means) to enjoy the Tate\nModern, as it does, and probably\nhas been designed to, appeal to\neveryone on some level. Those with\na keen interest in art, and those\nwho just enjoy being continually surprised and shocked by the pieces on\ndisplay will be both leave happy.\nHaving been greeted by the \"Half-Life Spider\" in the Great Hall,\nmake your way upstairs to the galleries where to paraphrase slightly,\nthere is great art you do know and\ngreat art you don't.I'm told the cafe is quite good too.\nwww. tate.org.uk/modern/default\n-'on reads like a Who's0 in art. Consequently the\nO o'0n al does extremely well for\n\u00b0 0\n' 'Ye seen that before\" kinda\nPieces.\n6\nNational is also a fine example\n7: Tate Britain\nThe Tate Britain in Pimlico seems to\nget forgotten these days with all the\nbuzz around the Tate Modern, but\nit's older sister is still worth a visit.\nThe Tate Britain is the national\ngallery of British art from 1500 to\nthe present day, \"the Tudors to the\nTurner Prize\" - its collection passing through such heavyweights as\nBlake, Constable, Gainsborough\nand Turner (the Blake, Hogarth and\nTurner areas being especially worth\nvisiting - see, for free, most of the\nworks from two of last year's most\npopular exhibitions, aha).\nThe Tate Modern houses the\nTate's modern art collection, but\nthe Tate Britain still plays home to\nthe annual Turner prize - a competition of British artists, and a another good reason to come here.\nIt allows one to see what is currently going on in the world of art;\nand whether you like it or not.\nwww.tate.org.uk/britain/default\n8: The V&A The world's largest museum of \"dec-or at ive art\", the V&A is a museum-cum-gallery featuring 145 galleries\npacked full of paintings, sculptures,\ntapestries and all manner of decorative titbits and ob jets d 'art. The\nexhibits from all across the world in\nthe seven miles and four floors of\ngalleries make for several repeat vis-its, and being just up the road from\ncollege it is suitable for both taking it\nall in, or just wandering around.\nThe V&A is very pleasant and un challenging, compared to the\nclassical pomp and ci rum stance one is more likely to find in say,\nthe British Museum.\nOne to watch is the Canon Photography Gallery. The museum\nhas always had a large collection of\nphotos, and this gallery should make\nfor some interesting exhibitions in\ntime to come - it is certainly a better\nvenue than the previous, in-the-basement-outside-the-cafe anyway.\nwww.v am. ac.uk\nAlternatively...\nThere are many more places out\nthere that for reasons of space\ncouldn't be included. Check out a listings magazine such as Time Out\nfor details.\nThe Last Word...\nFor whatever reason, you decided to come and study here, in\nbonny London. Now, this decision\nhas brought with it certain negative\npoints... the expense of such basic\ncommodities as accommodation\nand beer, the general dirt and\ngrime, and the feeling of alienation\nthat comes of Irving in a big city.\nBut there are also certain compensations. London also has so many\nthings out there worth seeing and\ndoing, and many of them will not\ncost a penny piece to visit for a student such as yourself - including all\nbut one of the ph a. And so forget science and do something arty with your Wednesday afternoons and weekends. You know it makes sense.\nAndrew\niw l \u2022 Nix \u2022 22nd January 2001 \u2022\n\n"
