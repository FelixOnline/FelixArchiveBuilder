It was not a Miner's Morphy this year hut the hard hatted stalwarts on the bahi chad the right spirit and showed that they\nat least had not forgotten the traditional chairing of their crew to the heat house* At least one miner showed his disapproval of the Felice ban with a very neat bit of blasting. The success of the Mine's Lance could be judged from, the general resolve, at the last general meeting, to have the Little Black Man announce a nether get together in the near future perhaps this time more of the Staff will be able to attend.

This notable turnout of over 170 people distinguished themselves even more\nby continuing from 8.30 p.m. until12.0 midnight without failing all this without a Jud l( or Yog.o) mat!\nMr. Peter Hayward was presented, with a washing machine\nwhich, he later converted into hard cash - as opposed to paper\nmoney.\nMr. Jimmy Booth - after some South American Jogo (or Yu di) was heard to remark, 'Yes, it shook me tool' Buffet and. prizes went off and down smoothly and many\ngraduate-) from, green to yellow to red yo cli( or Jugo) belts during the evening.' i hus ended the R.S.

Perhaps I'm prejudiced but I hardly think that I. C.W. A. should be blamed for this. Everything else was up to the usual high standard, with, the gym attractively decorated with travel posters and flowers. Even the balloons came down from the ceiling at the appointed time - though I believe that I.O. Yj.a.. co-opted a few friends who. kindly took\n\u2022 charge of this. Most of the evening was occupied with straight dancing, but a few novelty numbers wore introduced; a hat excuse-me dance being one of the most successful. happy idea was to ask Mr. Sandy Hill to be M.C. for an elimination dance,\nby means of which he chose his\" Ideal Girl\" He surpassed himself.

    "content": "The need- has been felt for some time for a frequently published journal to comment upon the affairs of the College whilst they are\nstill topical, and to bring to the attention of its members the\nactivities of Clubs and. Societies of which people at present know\nlittle, and knowing little, tend to care even less. This is a function which clearly cannot be performed by THE PR (EN IX, particularly since that estimable bird is now to appear only twice k year, and so\nFELIX has come to meet the need. We do not intend to encroach upon\nthe literary field covered by THE PHOENIX; rather do we intend to be\ncomplementary to that. journal, even if not always complimentary.\nNeither are we in any fay connected with it, nor are we Its offspring.( In any case, this unfortunate bird is presumably unable to produce\nany offspring, since only one bird exists at any one time, rising from the ashes of its predecessor. Perhaps this accounts for its doleful appearance). No, THE PHOENIX will remain m essentially literary magazine, whereas we shall content ourselves with providing a commentary upon events and personalities. The success or failure of this paper depends principally upon you, our readers. In the first place we depend upon you to produce many of our articles and reports, since our staff cannot\nthemselves attend and report every College event. Secondly we depend\nupon you to maintain a lively o or re soon den ce in our columns. Here\nIs an opportunity for you to airy^ ur opinions, ideas and grievances to the whole College instead of just to those within earshot at the\nbar, and replies can be published before everyone has forgotten what the original letter was about. Thirdly we depend upon y..u( to\nbuy y. ur own copy of FELIX, and not just to read somebody else s copy. We do net think that3 d Is beyond the financial scope even\nof a student trying to live on a F.E.T. grant, and copies for a term cost less than a pint of be fr. Any profits made by the paper are to be devoted to Sports Day, since it appears that the Union is now so impecunious that it may be unable to sub sid is e coaches and teas on that important\noccasion. Any contribution will be welcomed, whether it be a full article on the marital customs of the Wat uss i or a chance remark\nheard in the bar. Contributions and letters should be addressed to: The Editor, Imperial College Union, Prince Consort Road',\nContributors may write under nems de plume if they wish, but must\nsupply their names and Colleges with their contributions. A debt of gratitude is owed to F.C. EWELS for his suggestion of a title. He shall be rewarded, with a saucer of milk. We note with pleasure that Dinner in Hall is steadily gaining support as a regular College function. We learn that40 Dutch\nstudents are attending next Tuesday's dinner. If every member of the\nCollege makes a point of attending this function at least once a term, Its success will be assured. "

    "content": "clash with Mines, R.C.S. clashed with Guilds. The umpire stopped\nthe race and sent the crews back to the start. Your correspondent has been informed by members of all three crews that it was their crew which was going up at the time. With over a mile to go it was still anyone's race. The second start was Guilds all the way. They made a perfect start and were nearly \u2022\n\u00a7\n- a length up at Harrods when Mines, taking the bend, too wide, clashed with R.C.S., and the race was stopped\nfor the second, time. The only consoling thought for the crews\nwas how the vast body of police at Putney must have been enjoying themselves. At the third start Mines just got their nose in front, but they could do no more, and a magnificent race ensued with less than4 feet separating first and last crews, and no more than2 feet between blade tips. At the Chabtree Mines were just leading Guilds, who were only just leading R.C.S. At the mile post Guilds were up by a canvas with Mines nearly a canvas up on R.C.S. Approaching Fulham football ground, Guilds were f length up on\nMines, v/ hc were a canvas up on R.C.S. The Guilds cox, on the inside of this bend, began to take it on along turn, and the R.C.S. followed him round. The Mines cox appeared to think that the other two were making a short turn, came round too far and\ntoo fast, and hit R.C.S. The umpire stopped the race and restarted them in the relative positions before the clash. The row in past the boat\nhouses was no reflection of the racing that had gone before, and it was decided that the result to be recorded should be that at the time of the last clash. Guilds, \u00a3 length, Mines, a canvas,\nR.C.S. The time taken 'was 1 hour 20 minutes, a record for this7| minute course. Crews.\nC&G. Bow T. Gilbert,2 S. Peerless,3 J.C. Howe, 4 J. Shaw,\n5 L.

LOWRY CUP.\nThe race for the Lowry Cup which followed, in gathering darkness, was a lesson in co xing. Starting from the milepost, all three cox es showed how it should be done. The Guilds crew,\nan excellent one, made no mistake and. showed that the way it had harried its first boat in training had made it unbeatable. They\nwent ahead to win easily, leaving a most exciting race for second place between R.C.S and Mines, in which both crews lead several times by a foot or two only to be pulled back by sheer\nfighting spirit. The result, justly so, was a dead heat for second place. Crews.\nC&G Bow R. Clark,2 A. Waterfall,3 P. Moffat,4 B. Davis,5 W. Bergwerk, 6 P. Sharpe, 7 C. Baines, S tr.P. Watson,\nCox J. Lewis. R.C.S.

M: and R.C.3 coxswain's race;. It was'. For the first time in liv.ii.ig memory a clash occurred, necessitating are start, and this happened not\nonce, but three times. In view of this, perhaps a few words on steering the Morphy\nwould be helpful. The Laws of Beat Racing state that the proper course for a boat to be steered is that which will take it to the finish in the shortest time. This means that the coxswains\nmust try to keep their boats in the fastest flowing o art of the\nstream. Thus, in the- Morphy, the first battle for position, comes\nat Harrods bend, where a wide turn means the outside crow losing the stream, and the second at Fulham football ground where, if a wide turn is made, the inside crew can gain \u00a7 a length in a few\nstrokes. Mindful of trie way in which, by\nwon the Morphy last year, the coaches of th crews spent much time in. telling their cox es that they must on no\naccount be pusher] out of their courses. As it turned out, the\ncox es, for once, had listened only too well, arid mistaking injunctions against being pushed for orders to force their way\nthrough, they made a fiasco of what would probably have been the finest Morphy ov . r. So much for explanations. What of the race itself? As the crews drifted under Hammersmigh Bridge the sun came\nout and made conditions for the race us perfect as could be\nwished. R.C.S. and R.S. M. made excellent starts but Guilds appeared slightly rushed, but even so rowed stroke for stroke with R.C.S. and completed the first10 in just under the quarter a phenomenal rating for heavy clinkers. R.C.S. had their nose in front from the second stroke and proceeded to take it away well, blades being really solid in the water. As the crews approached\nHarrods, R.S. M. began to decrease the inches lead of the R.C.S., and at the lower end of Harrods wharf were about 2 feet up on the R.C.S., with. Guilds a further2 feet behind. Mines, on the inside of the bend, were a] it tle wide and as light clash occurred between R.C.S. and Guilds, which they were able to clear without difficulty. All three crews were rowing well, particularly the Mines, who with real heavyweights in the middle of the boat were\nmaking best use of them by rowing at a slightly slower rate of striking. As the crews approached the Crab tree, Mines were lead in, by i: length from the R.G. S., who were slightly up on Guilds. All three crews were very close together, and, in trying to avoid a "

    "content": "Cole brat lon with Kup'-r cuss lone.* 'OT centuries men, women and children, connected in the\nsmallest way with this country, have taken it to be their joyous\nand inalienable right to rend the silence and blacknes.s of the\nNovember night, for one night only, with loud explosions and\nvivid flames and fireworks. The men, women and children of this College differ little from their predecessors in this respect, and on\"~Novembor 5 th1949, many hundred students with escort.. me reed from the\nmerrymaking at the- \"Hop\" to gambol and caper, indeed to celebrate in the way that Guy Pawkes so unwittingly initiated. Know this, friends; these merry-makers w re indeed worthy of\nthat title. The appellations of organised, troublemakers or\nhooligans ring as untrue as apologies' in the ear of one who has\nbeen cri on lod in the Scrum. Imagine, therefore, the consternation among these revellers at being greeted in the shadow of the Albert Hall by our blue coated brothers in inflamed mood. Report after report was passed around of he who had been punched in the\nkidneys, she who was pushed in the face, and others worse ly handled. This treatment, one may conjecture, was designed to quell any merrymaking and fIre working, and in fact force\" a hasty retreat by all to the Fniort. The design was bad; there are probably few\nother bodies in the British ccm rrr an it y who value their freedom and\ntheir rights as much as Students. The rough behaviour of the Law\naroused indignation, hut apart from urgent expostulation, no\ndeparture was made from the practice of Bonfire lighting, the\ncreation of Mighty Explosions and the indescribable whirl and\nturmoil attendant upon the Festival Spirit. Indeed 4 students( one at least of whom comes from The Bush) were defying the\nflames and. flying fireworks in a dance of delight round the fire. Meanwhile The Prince Consort looked down benignly, and reassured himself, we are sure, by telling himself of the safety of the\nstructure around his head.\nOthers seemed- to disagree, albeit reverently, with the\nmeasured opinion of the Prince and more blue helmets were seen\nto bob their way ( usually accompanied by a constable) towards\nthe fire harmless as it was. In an instant there was at pur t of water: aloud hissing and an uprising of angry steam marked\nthe dousing of the friendly flames. But, friends, this was not\nall. The jet of water having done its deed was then directed on\nto those who hitherto, had been enjoying the pleasing warmth and\nhappiness exuding from the fire. Only one outcome could there be; students bore down upon the unpleasant hose in an attempt to maintain the dryness of their clothing. The further outcome was\nunexpected, for in an instant some of our numbers were linking arms with policemen and walking in some haste towards the mobile police van's. It became evident that strong measures were being taken\nby the Law to discontinue the customary celebration; and even\nmore so when student after student was flung into a black van and\nremoved to custody. It wis an Uneven contest, for the umpire was\nnot on our side. However, the student body is not one to say\ngoodbye before the final whistle, and their attentions having been distracted from the albert Memorial Steps (oh, bad\nstrategy, sir'.) some students were seen to have difficulty in crossing the road towards tin. Hall without lifting a vehicle or\ntwo out of the way. Finally, conscious of the fact that the best activities should not continue after the climax, cries of \"Come\non I.C.\" and tte chanting of the; I.C. Boomalaka brought an\non joy able but disappointing evening to a close For some, but others, languishing in Chelsea Police Station, were not wholly appreciative of the humour of the\noccasion. These 16 unfortunates appeared before the Beak on the\nMonday, to be remanded for a fortnight, since this was Considered to be no mere display of \"the exuberance of youth\" but a serious incident. In the interim police helmets w ire sought among the\nstudent bode with little success; many hearts, however, were\n\n"

    "content": "THE ESCAPADES OF BOANERGES IN THE LONDONBRIGHT OK RALLY . I0V EM3ER15 th. The weather forecast on the Saturday evening was not very promising, cold with scattered showers. It was only to be hoped\nthat the showers would not scatter themselves .on. the LondonB right on road. It meant an early start for all concerned and the\nvery sleepy crew of \"Boanerges\" rolled, up at the College at\n7.15 a.m. In the grey ness of the morning \"Bo\" certainly looked rather dispassionate but after the addition of a few gallons of the\nessentials the old boy seemed a little more perky. At last after innumerable adjustments had been made to the too numerous\ncontrols Bo arrived in fine time at the \"Magazine\" in Hyde Park,\nwhere the noise and smoke seemed to grow in volume as did the\nspirits of the crews of \"Bo and the tender\".1 he\" Guilds\" veteran was superior in that it arrived under\nits own power; for most of the veterans had. been carried not\njust towed - on quite massive constructions which devotedly followed their charges. In the Park it was discovered that \"Bo\" had not\nenough water to last the journey; so what could be better than to fill the spare cans from the Serpentine. The veterans were started in order of age at intervals of thirty seconds. \"Bo\" was number\n48 and was soon off to a fine start, with the tender following watchfully. i'hr cai gh London went the procession; past most of the noble\nbuildings and. almost all London was taken in gallant stride; Brixton Hill caused a little trouble for some veterans but not\nso for the mighty \"Boanerges\" - at least not after he realised he would have to go up, so he stopped banging and smoking and\nwent up in triumph, but when he had collected his cheers he\nflagged and had to be revived by some Serpentine water. Perhaps it was imagination but \"Bo\" seemed to have more\nvocals up oort throughout the journey than the rest of the entrants put together. \"Boanerges\" had one misfortune, but quite a minor\none. The nut came off one of the chain joining links, but it gave the crew time to stamp their feet, and. someone experience in the use of a hammer.\nIt seems that the \" Guilds\" is not very willing for a truce with the \"Gentlemen\" In blue, for they flaunted an acquired taxi horn at every aforementioned \"Gentleman\" they encountered\nas well as going a little too close for comfort. This was perhaps\nunfortunate as the Police on that Sunday were really cooperative, allowing staggering veterans to rattle across against the lights. It was true that manners were not lacking in the crew of \"Boanerges\"\nhowever, for all gestures whether from onlookers or Police were\nacknowledged if only by the taxi horn. After a while it was\nrealised, that \"Bo\" was speeding, this being prohibited by the rules of the R.A.C. for this run and at one point \"Bo\" was actually to be seen doing40 rn.p.h.( although It was downhill). \"Bo\" eventually arrived in Maderia Drive with much cheering and waving whilst steam issued from the various pipes of other\nveterans. after lunch \"Bo\" was moved to the pavilion where the Mayor's tea was to be held. It was here that further preparations were\ncarried out for the return journey. This tea was the high spot\nof the day and perhaps it was not strictly true to s ay that all \"Bo's\" crew and followers were invited, but all attended in the\ntrue Imperial College fashion. During the tea~ it was learnt that \"Bo\" had been disqualified for in dule rina in excessive speed. The day was drawing into evening\nand the return journey had to be faced, i 'his was quite uneventful except that \"Bo\" was very reluctant to forego further refreshments, as were the crew.\nThe taxi horn was used to full advantage whilst the crowds\nin\" Piccadilly\" were given a. fine exhibition of circular motoring with Mr. Carr uther s in the chair. Finally the commission aire at\nthe Dorchester was allowed to use his voice in order to stop 'Bo\"\nentering, so \"Bo\" reluctantly returned to college, decidedly hot\nunder the bonnet.\n\n"

    "content": "THE BOAT CLUB DINNER.\nYour reporter apologise s for any omissions and misstatements\nhe may make, and wishes the fact that. he had had several in the boat house, several more in the Star and Garter, and a few for good measure in the I.C. bar before the dinner started, to be\ntaken into consideration. His rather w his sh led con dish on assisted in his enjoyment\nof ahi every enjoyable evening, but did not help him to write very intelligible hier oh ic glyph. h. ics on the back of his ticket to the Resident's Dinner - he had forgotten his notebook.\nHaving no statistics a this disposal, he can only hazard a quiet guess that this years dinner, like the Morphy itself, was one of the longest on record, if it did not actually create a new high. It was., however, a very happy function, and the food was excellent1..' \u2022\n,\nThe King's health having been drunk, the club captain, Len Webb, on behalf of all present, congratulated the chef, who\naccepted his first offer of a glass of brandy, but bashfully declined the second - the ears of the assembly.\nThe captain next asked Col. Lowry to present the Morphy and\nLowry Cups to the day's victorious crews, both from the City& Guilds, and to the winners of this years Senior, Junior and\nNovices sculling tre phi es, woh by C.H \u2022'.Barwise , fl .Pushraan and\nR. Br o ok res pe et i ve1y. Charles Bristow, the first speaker, proposed, the health of\nthe club, in a speech which lasted the surprisingly short time\nof 34 minutes, first prize in the sweep being won by H. Pushman.\nIt is difficult to make notes on a speech even of this length on\nthe back of a ticket to the Resident's Dinner, but your reporter is quoted as saying that it was as good as Charles' speeches\nalways are, and. embraced the aims and history of the club. In reply, the captain must definitely have set up a new\nrecord.. He spoke for5 minutes longer than Charles I Your reporter cannot help but, feel that this was not a good precedent, as Charles is not one who can take as light of this nature lightheartedly, and will most certainly take steps to see that it cannot be\nrepeated.( Next year's reporter is advised to buy two tickets to the Resident's Dinner).' Len Webb ended by presenting a portable typewriter to Charles, on behalf of the club, in recognition of his services as treasurer, which post he was relinquishing, Brian Thwaites\ntaking over. Your reporter was very hazy by this time. Peter Ali is ton next proposed the health of Thames Rowing\nClub, and also proposed that the sort cut to T.R. C. bar should go\ndown in. posterity as \" Charles' Cut\", Charles having been the master mind behind the idea and design. Mr. Kirkpatrick, T.R. C., replying, said, inter alia, he\nwas glad the I.C.. boat house was such a fine new building, as it helped to support Thames boat house. Brian Thwaites proposed the health, of the guests, which included the representatives of several clubs London, Reading\nUniversity, Vesta K..C. etc., the first captain, Col. Lowry,\nPaul Gumming and Spud Hayter. Col. Lowry, in reply, quoted freely from the classics; these quotations were very amusing, and your reporter apologise s for only remembering one - \" This ghastly crew\" from the Ancient Mariner.;- one of whose members he was beginning to resemble, as\nhe tottered Into the har for a quick one f \u00b0 r the road. He was last seen, steering a Morphy course past the tennis courts, mutter in a\" I'll teach these cocks h wine tosh te er\", and\nwondering what he'd done with his ticket to the Resident's Dinner-\n"
