Three of next\nyear's sabbaticals decided upon and\na turnout of about 1150 - 19% of\nthe electorate. This is better than\nlast year, and about the same as the\nyear before, but nonetheless it is\nextremely indicative of the attitude\nof the Union members to the\nrunning of that same Union. I refer\nyou to the comments of my last\neditorial concerning the voluntary\nmembership of Unions - this\nelectorate quite honestly couldn't give a shit.\nOn to the candidates. Firstly, this\nhas been a very clean campaign;\ncongratulations to all involved. In\nMusic Box\nAny band named after a Billy Bragg\nsong that Kirsty McColl covered is\nfine by me\nPoddy.\nMONDAY 16th Pheasant Pluckers\nUnion Bar\nTUESDAY 17th New England, Almost\nHuman & Petroleum Spirit\nUnion Lounge\nall cases bar Felix editor this may\nhave been because of the complete\nlack of character and organisation\nof the candidates rather than\nbecause of any particular policy.\nSecondly, my commiserations to\nthose who lost and congratulations\nto the winners - at least they had the\nget up and go to get involved.\nShame they couldn't have done it\nearlier rather than when they\nsuddenly found out they had no job\nnext year, but no matter.\nIt seems that the candidates for\nHonorary Secretary - Aled Fenner\nand Nick Allen - must have\nobserved what the present\nincumbent has been up to and\ndecided it was quite a good dos s for\na year. This is the appearance they\ngave -\u2022 if you treat the job like a joke, the electorate treat you like a joke. This Union tends to go in\nboom-and-bust cycles; years when\nthe Sabbs take control and shake the\nUnion into some semblance of\nefficiency and years when there is\nno effective rudder and control is\nleft to the clubs and societies. Last\nyear, under Paul Shanley and Ben\nTurner, and the year before under\nNeil McCluskey, the Union was\nrun. This year it has drifted, under\nDear Adam.\nFelix Issue 929\u2014'Rector'\nFurther to my telephone call to\nyour office this morning, I would\nrepeat my concern about the\nincorrect and misleading\ninformation in the above article.\nThe post of Rector is not 'due to\nbe vacated in the immediate future'.\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, is due to\na Deputy President who nobody\nknows, a democratically elected\nstudent representative President\nwho patently doesn't know what\ndemocracy entails and an Hon Sec\nwho has been seriously\nunder worked. And a Print Unit\nManager who has decided the best\nway to manage it is by doing the\nabsolute minimum print unit work,\nwho is also a Felix editor suffering\nthe delusion that leaving the Union\noffice alone will improve relations.\nWell, bang goes that. So I'm being\nnegative - believe me, this Union\ndeserves it. It claims to represent IC\nstudents, and is often pitted against\nthe twin monsters of College and\nGovernment, both highly\nprofessional and powerful\norganisations, and it is failing.\nUnder the present system it is not\nworking for students and it is my\njob to point it out. Perhaps I should\nhave done it earlier. Perhaps I would have been accused of not\ngiving the Union a 'chance.'\nThe Union Office Sabb winners\n- Rick Bilby and Chris Davidsondid not exactly make their name\nknown in College or Union circles\nbefore standing. I had never heard\nof them before - and most things\nretire on 31st July 1993 at normal\nretiring age.\nI should be glad if you would\npublish a statement to correct this\nerror at the earliest possible\nopportunity.\nWith kind regards.\nYours sincerely,\nAngus Fraser.\neventually reach the Felix Office.\nI sincerely wish them all the best\nand I cannot stress too strongly that\nthey should immediately start\nlooking into the Union and\nformulate ideas about how it should\nbe improved. But don't fail your\ndegree, for God's sake. I am not\nterribly hopeful about their chances\nof success - but I should leave that\nto my successor, in whom, I have\nto say, I have great confidence. He\nis basically two faced, devious and\nnasty.\nGet rid of sabbaticals and get\nsome professional staff in. It's the\nonly way you are going to get\nguaranteed quality of service.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies Felix 930 11 March 1992\nIndoor Soccer Tournament\nLast Tuesday ( 3 rd March) I turned up at the Volleyball Court\nhoping to play a game of football\nagainst the Italian Society. However\nmy team mates and I had been naive\nto think that we actually would play\nfootball, since we actually\nparticipated in a karate match.\nThe opposition showed great\ntechnique with their kicks to the\nface as well as excellent skill with\ntheir leg sweeps. To top of their\nperformance, one Italian decided to\nsee how acrobatic I was with a perfectly timed trip. Unfortunately,\nI was out of practise and landed on\nmy back, banging my head on the\nfloor during the process.\nAfter the contest, I was obliged\nto see my doctor to see if I could\nshorten her stock of drugs. I was out\nof luck, since she only prescribed\npain killers, even though she hinted\nthat I should rest for a few days.\nSo the morale of this story is that\nwhilst I was at home convalescing,\nthere was no one in FELIX to\ncomplete the Indoor Soccer\nTournament page. Thus the\nconfusion over this weeks fixtures.\nThis page now has the results for\nthe games that have been played up\ntill Tuesday (10th March), and the\nlatest group tables. The remaining\nfixtures for this week are also\nshown at the bottom of this page.\nRemember, the top team from each\ngroup qualifies for the next stage\ntogether with the two best\nrunner-ups.\nTues, 10.3.92\n1.00-1.30pm1.302.00 pm Wed, 11.3.92\n4.00-4.30pm4.305.00 pm( re sch)\n5.00-5.30pm5.306.00 pm Thurs, 12.3.92\n3.00-3.30pm3.304.00 pm4.004.30 pm4.305.00 pm5.005.30 pm Sat, 14.3.92\n6.00-6.30pm Pakistan 1\nChem Eng\nvs\nvs\nComputing\nItalian\nCypriot\nIndian\nIslamic 1\nIslamic 2\nvs\nvs\nvs\nvs\nSingapore\nSnooker 1\nSri Lankan\nLebanese\nICFC 1\nMalaysian 1\nSikh 2\nSnooker 1\nSnooker 2\nLebanese 2\nICFC 2\nIC SEDS\nMalaysian 2\nBridge Club\nIndian vs Sikh\nThurs, 27.2.92 Score\n3.30-4.00pm Sikh 1 vs Snooker 1 7-11\n4-4.30pm Sikh 2 vs Lebanese 1 8-9\nSat, 29.2.92 Score\n6.30-7.00pm Italian vs Computing 3-0\n7.00-7.30pm Cypriots vs Sri Lankan 11-4\n7.30-8.00pm ICFC 2 vs Bridge Club 24-3\nTues, 3.3.92 Score\n1.00-1.30pm Pakistan 2 vs Lebanese 2 2-5\n1.30-2.00pm Pakistan 1 vs Italian 3-8\nWed, 4.3.92 Score\n12.00-12.30pm Snooker 1 vs Indian PP4.004.30p m Malaysian 1 vs Bridge Club 9-7\n4.30-5.00pm Computing vs Chem Eng 0-12\n5.00-5.30pm Islamic 1 vs Cypriot 4-5\n5.30-6.00pm Islamic 2 vs Sikh 2 6-9\nThurs, 5.3.92 Score\n3.30-4.00pm Sikh 1 vs Malaysian 2 3-0\n4.00-4.30pm Snooker 2 vs ICFC 2 10-4\n4.30-5.00pm Sri Lankan vs Singapore PPPP85 Score\nScore\nScore\nThe knock-out phase of the\ntournament shall take place next\nWednesday (18th March) starting at\n9.30a m.All teams who have\nqualified should turn up at the\nVolleyball Court at this time. More\ndetails shall appear in the bumper\nend-of-term edition of FELIX.\nAs for the sponsorship, Nat West\nBank have categorically rejected\nour proposal, explaining that the\ntournament doesn't qualify for\nconsideration under their criteria.\nHowever, upon hearing the\noutcome of the proposal, Mr Jamieson, our branch manager,\ndecided to offer IC 1ST \u00a3100 from\nhis branch'sk offers. But it is a sad\nstate of affairs when a bank,\noperating within a college campus,\nGROUP1 cannot support the students who\ncontribute with their hard earned\nmoney, towards making the profits\nupon which the bank operates.\nNow for a few points of detail.\nIt seems the Lebanese Society has\nbeen suspended by the OS C. Therefore, IC 1ST have no option\nbut to disqualify both their teams\nfrom the tournament. This means\ntheir opponents shall be awarded a30 win. Finally, due to my injury,\na few games were postponed last\nweek. These games shall only be\nplayed if it is deemed that they have\na direct bearing on the final table\npositions.\nKhurrum\nTEAM P WDL FA Pts\nChem Eng 3 3 0 0 33 10 9\nItalian 3 2 0 1 16 11 6\nComputing 2 0 0 2 0 15 0\nPakistan 1 2 0 0 2 8 21 0\nGROUP2 GROUP3 GROUP4 GROUP5 GROUP6 TEAM P WDL FA Pts\nICFC 2 2 2 0 0 34 7 6\nMalaysian 1 2 2 0 0 20 13 6\nSnooker 2 2 0 0 2 10 21 0\nBridge Club 2 0 0 2 TO 33 0\nTEAM P WDL FA Pts\nCypriots 2 2 0 0 16 8 6\nIslamic Soc 1 2 1 0 1 13 9 3\nSingapore 2 1 0 1 12 12 3\nSri Lankan 2 0 0 2 7 19 0\nTEAM P WDL FA Pts\nIndian 1 1 0 0 11 2 3\nSnooker 1 1 1 0 0 11 7 3\nSikh 1 2 1 0 1 10 11 3\nMalaysian 2 2 0 0 2 2 14 0\nTEAM P WDL FA Pts\nSikh 2 2 1 0 1 17 15 3\nLebanese 1 1 1 0 0 9 8 3\nIslamic 2 2 1 0 1 15 15 3\nIC SEDS 1 0 0 1 6 9 0\nTEAM P WDL FA Pts\nICFC 1 1 1 0 0 27 3 3\nLebanese 2 1 1 0 0 5 2 3\nPakistani 2 2 0 0 2 5 32 0\nFelix is produced lor and behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit.

    "content": "Sabbatical Election Results\ni wouldn't say I'm devastated that\nI lost, but I am pretty upset about\nit.' said Angelo Gardini, as he\nblundered his way towards the bar\nafter the announcement of the 1992\nsabbatical election results.\nAfter voting in all departments on\nMonday and Tuesday, the counting\nof ballot papers began at 6.30pm last night. When the results were\nannounced at 9 . 4 3 pm, Chris Davidson had been elected\nPresident. Rick Bilby had been\nelected Deputy President, and Jonty\nBeavan had been elected Felix\nEditor.\nThe shock of the evening was the\nfirst ever victory for New Election\nas Honorary Secretary (Events).\nThis is only the second election that\nNew Election has won. In 1990.\nNew Election was elected to the\npost of Deputy President,\nsomething that had been suggested\nfor this year.\nChris Davidson. elected\nPresident on the back of the St.\nMary's vote, thanked everyone who\nvoted for him, and to everyone who\nhelped out. The disproportionate\ninfluence of the St. Mary's block\nvote was also shown in the Deputy\nPresident and Honorary Secretary\n(Events) elections. Its effect was\nless marked in the election for Felix\nEditor, where it combined with the\nDepartments of Computing, Mathematics and Physics vote to\nhelp push Jonty Beavan over the\nquota on the first count.\nAled Fenner. former Honorary\nSecretary (Events) candidate,\nblamed the St. Mary's block vote\nfor the victory of New Election.\n'The Mary's vote basically put us\nout. both of us .... they don't really\ncare anything about Imperial', he\ntold i CNN in the Union Bar after\nthe announcement.\nBoth Aled Fenner and Nick Allen\nhave declared their intention to\nstand again for Honorary Secretary.\nPhil Sharp, defeated Deputy\nPresidential candidate, also\ndeclared his candidature. ' Me and\nAngelo are standing as joint\ncandidates ... we're standing on the\ncampaign of 'we'll do fuck all', so\nwe think we'll get elected.' There\nwas speculation last night that\nDrarrrSoc may also propose an\nHonorary Secretary candidate.\nCurrent ICU President, Zoe Hellinger. said, 'it's a shame about\nthe Hon. Sec. new election\".\nRick Bilby, Deputy PresidentElect. announced himself 'well\npleased for the result. All the hard\nwork I put in paid off. Jonty\nBeavan. next year's Felix editor,\nsaid he was very happy with the\nresult. Jonty thanked his colleague\nand fellow candidate, Toby Jones,\nfor running 'a very gentlemanly\ncampaign', adding 'it's a great\nshame he (Toby) lost'.\nAbsent from the declaration was\nAnthony Baldwin, who failed to\nsurface during the whole campaign.\nHis proposer, Bruce Hall, said that\nhis campaign 'was to try to bring\ninto stark contrast the election\nsystem', and that Baldwin' s campaign was designed to give an\nopportunity to 'people who wanted\nto vote against the way the union is\nbeing run at the present.' Those\nwho were unhappy with the election\nexpressed their dissatisfaction both\ninside and outside the ballot box.\nOn a17% turnout, over 10% of votes cast were spoiled. Whether\nthis expresses frustration with the\nUnion or unfamiliarity with the\nSTV voting system used has yet to\nbe revealed. (i CNN). "
