In\nspite of a lack of polish, the production was of\na reasonably high standard and the acting was, at times, very good indeed. The three main characters,\nj laye d by Barbara Harris, Ieuan David and Tony Osman\nwere all very well portrayed, leu an David's performance being especially Accomplished.\nThe difficulties attending this undertaking,\nparticularly the fact that the theatre could be\naired for one day only meant that the sets were\nrather rough, but two of the three settings were\nquite effective nevertheless.\nThe large audience received the play well, and we hope that the Comus Players will put on\nmore plays of the quality of \"Anna Christie.\" Phoenix\nThis term, Phoenix is rising later than\nusual from the ashes, and it should be on sale\nnext Tuesday.\nIt has an international nature, containing\narticles by students here from abroad, and\nconcerning vacation jaunts last summer. In this category, the social life of the Gliding Club\non their Yugoslav tour is entertainingly written\nby the Editor-Elect of Phoenix, Vere Atkinson,\nAn abridged version of the Rectors inaugural\naddress is included (reviewed in FELIX No.83),\nAn account of the 'digs' situation in South\nKensington gives us a new slant on the currer t position, and suggests a new Lodgings Bureau\nbe set up in South Kensington which would do more\nfor I.C. students than the present one in Bloomsbury,\nRobin bray's article on motor cycling and\npoetry is amusing, and shows him to be trusted in his position on the library committee to buy us\nbooks worth reading.\nAltogether, it is well worth buying this Edition\nof Phoenix, it containing many fresh topics. To\nprevious readers who will from experience know what\nto skip this will probably leave them the most\ndiverse assortment of articles since they read\ntheir first copy.\nChoir Concert\nThe Choir of the I.C. Musical Society, ably\nconducted by Miss Imogen Hoist, gave their Christmas\nConcert in Queen Alexandra House to a large audience\non 7th. December. The Choir gave a competent first London performance of Benjamin Britten's 'Hymn to Saint Peter', being well supported by the Jacques\nString Orchestra.

Just one week ago I had a rather strange dream,wh i oh although rather meaningless the following morning,nega ni to\nhave some small significance when the same dream visited ray\nslumbers the next night. Once again the bright morning S TBS light streaming in through in y window helped to clear away\nthe strange vision of the dark hours.During the day I could\nnot prevent my thoughts from turning to the dream wh i oh had haunted my slumbers on the last two evenings.

Saoh night I have been led\nfurther along the passage,and by the increasing fear within\nme I know that the meaning of my dream is shortly to be\nrevealed^and I know that the secret c is contained at the end\nof the passage.By my fear I know that whatever I find will\nbe beyond the so oie ty of earthly beings.\nTb-day is Sunday and in order to escape from the veil of\nfear that shrouds my house,I have motored out onto the moors.\nLeaving the car parked off the road, I set out ao rossa deserted part of the moor unknown to myself.With sudden horror I discovered that the path I was BOW on was the dreaded path\nof my dre a nuBra m on by the same ir re pre sib le urge I ex per vie no e in my dream, I continue until the path ends. The small\ncliff that confronts me is to familiar by now,and I realise\nthat my mystery will shortly be solved - if only by myself.\nIt has just oo cured to me that before I enter from the light\ninto the dark I will set down the few words you have just\nread.At least you will know part of my. story.

Not very long after T return from the\nbitter grind of this 'holiday' comes - exams.' if the others don't work like me and my friends, ws\nsay that they will never get through,\ntt really is not fair to be disparaging about\npeople like me who treat our studies with utmost\nIMMBMII, Be shall be the leaders; sf the nat-ion.
