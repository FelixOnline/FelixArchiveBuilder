    "content": "E Manager's Bit\nA cheery hello to all you newcomers and\nhi again to everyone who made it back.\nAs many of you should know by now I wasn't as successful in my finals as the\nother three sabbaticals. This means that\nthe post of FELIX Editor is up for grabs\nand 1 loose my livelihood from the end of\nNovember. If anyone is interested in the\njob they should first come and see me in\nthe FELIX office. Then after you\nunderstand what is involved you can go\nand sign up.\nNightmare\nThe week leading up to Freshers has\nbeen a nightmare, with ridiculous\nrequests to carry out work and a smaller\nstaff quota than usual. Over the summer\nanother problem emerged. The career's fair guide was put together by someone\nwho knew nothing about handbook\nproduction, right down to not knowing\nwhat advertising material to request from\ncompanies. It would have been a much\nsimpler task if someone had given them a run down of what to do and what to\nexpect. As it was, it took twice as long to\nput together and I hope that it looks ok\nin finished form. It meant an 85 hour\nweek for myself and an afternoon edition\nof FELIX. This will not happen again! We\nare here to produce FELIX first and to\nhelp out the Union and its' clubs and\nsocieties second.\nAsbestos\nOn page 20 you will see a story\nconcerning an issue that came out over\nthe summer. In it I made a classic\njournalistic error by stating something as\nfact rather than a vehement statement\nmade to me by the person concerned.\nTalking to him in hospital was a depressing experience and I was sorry to\nhear that he died recently. The rest of\nthe story seemed well founded from the\nconversations I had with other members\nof college.\nSnack Bar\nOver the summer much thought was\nyet again put into the operation of the\nUnion Snack Bar. It was decided to\nextend the serving area to allow a greater through-put of customers. The\nproblems encountered so far being that\nnot enough people were being served\nquickly enough. After chasing the quotes\nit was decided to drop the scheme until a later date which is a great shame. The\nwork could have been completed in the\ntime available and provided a far better\nfacility for the students and staff.\nPromotion, of the Snack Bar in the same\nvein as the college refectories has also\nbeen ruled out. It was considered to be\nan un viable method to bring more\ncustomers over to the Union building and\ncan only result in a loss of income. Rob\nNorthey must be laughing all the way to\nthe bank again. I only hope that you\nsupport this facility as much as possible.\nPress Releases\nOn a lighter note I have been deluged\nby press releases over the summer.\nAmongst them, some wonderful\naddresses; The Managing Director,\nImperial College; The FELIX Office, Bert\nTriangle; and The FELIX Office, Imperial\nCottage. Some of the exciting ones told\nme detailed and sensitive information on\nRover car price rises and others about\nnew exhibitions like photographs of\nfishing in the 1920's. The best prize for a press release must go to the Royal Mail.\nA new line of sealed plastic envelope\npacks was promoted by one such article\nsent containing a teddy bear. Not only\nwas this the most original idea but the\nnew arrival has gone down very well in\nthe office.\nIt has been used as both a comforter to\nhangover victims and stress relieve r to\nthe highly strung. Or, in the case of Mr\nShanley - the psychotic. The former being\nadmirably illustrated by our printer, Andy\nThompson - just one of the victims of the\nUnion staff bash that also knocked out\none College department for the whole of\nthe next day.\nCredits\nFirstly I must give a HUGE THANKYOU to Liz Warren for her book review\nin the last issue for which she was not\ncredited. She has also contributed many\ninvaluable hours to the production of this\nedition. Rose has been very busy\ntypesetting for both FELIX and other\nwork and as usual managed to keep\nsmiling throughout the week. Andy has\nalso worked very hard, despite the\nmorning after the night before syndrome.\nHe even came in on Sunday to print the\nrest of this issue. Thanks to Toby Jones\nfor the news, Richard Eyers for the\nphotography, Adam T and Sarah for the\nreviews pages, Jason Lander for his rant,\nSimon Haslam for half of the icons, and\nIan, Sydney Harbour-Bridge, Murray (who\nseems to think that he was born\nyesterday, pi5), Benjamin and Shan for\nlots of things. So far it's just the Ents\ncrew who have come along to collate -cheers to Peter, Dominic and Graham.\nAnybody I 've missed or turns up later\nwill get credited next week.\nUNION CARDS\nMonday 1st9am5p m Tuesday 2n d9am2p m Wednesday 3r d10am4p m Thursday 4th10am4 pm Friday 5th10am4 pm BIOSTAR LTD Range of high quality houseplants\nat competitive prices on sale at the\nstart of term in the Junior Common Room, Sherfield Building\nWednesday 3rd, Friday 5th and\nFriday 12th,10am4 pm ANNOUNCEMENTS \u2022 A STANDARD first aid course under the\nHealth & Safety at Work Act will be held\non Monday 8th October 1990.

    "content": "STOIC and IC Radio Television arguably now influences the\nway we see the world more than either\nthe printed word or radio. This is partly\nbecause it combines the medium of\nwritten words (in the form of scripts),\naudio effects and visual images. Students\nTelevision of Imperial College provides\nyou with an opportunity to learn about\nand use one of the best equipped student\ntelevision stations in the country.\nBut far from being all serious, on the\nprogramme side we produce 'Into the\nNight' on Fridays, showing popular films\nto all the halls of residence with live\ncomic f?) links. Throughout the year there\nare trips to places such as the Museum of\nthe Moving Image, Thames Television\nand social outings such as ten pin\nbowling.\nKeeping the studio and the four mile\ncable network working is not easy, and\nHugh, our technical manager, would be\nglad of any help. No experience required.\nIf any aspect of Television appeals to\nyou then come and see us, we are on the\ntop floor of the Union Building. For a sample of the programmes we produce\nwatch 'Into the Night' this Friday, or even\nbetter come up to the studio and help us\ngo 'on air'.\nRichard Crook.\nImperial College Radio is IC's most\naccessible media club, and the country's only student radio station broadcasting in\na built up area. Since reportedly humble\nbeginnings in the mid-seventies, IC Radio\nhas expanded from single speakers in a few communal areas to broadcasting live\nevery day on 999kHz AM.\nEach week we present an up-to-the-minute college news service and a wide\nrange of music programmes: breakfast\nshows, lunchtime news updates and light\nentertainment, and a range of more\nspecialised music shows into the night,\ntogether with the news team's feature\nprogrammes.\nThe most obvious way to become\ninvolved with IC Radio is surprisingly\nsimple. Approach any station member or\ncall in at our main studio in Southside,\nnext to the shop and ask to be trained as\na presenter. After two or three hours of\nbeing shown the ropes by one of our\nexperienced presenters you'll be allowed\non air\u2014ready or not. You are free to\ndevelop your own style, and possibly\nspecialise in a certain musical area.\nAnything goes, and new ideas are sought\nafter hungrily\u2014why not write a radio\nplay, or a feature for the news team. On\nthe other side of things, we are one of\nthe best equipped student stations in the\ncountry and keeping it all working takes\nsome time. If you can wield a soldering\niron (or even if you can't), come and be a part of our technical team repairing\nthings that have gone wrong or building\nnew projects.\nThis is a rare chance to play at being\npart of the glamorous (?) media, to use\nand develop your creative talents. Even if\nyou only want to try a one off show you\nare welcome. Come and see us at\nFreshers' Fair at the base of the Queen's Tower or drop into our studio any\nevening for a coffee and a look round\u2014\nwe want to see as many new faces as\npossible this year.\nTom Cunnington, Station Manager .\nMl'I MM MBW L.I \u2014\n'The President Speaks'\n\n"

Q. Lounge B.G.S. D.B. P.Ent s we cannot guarantee you entrance. After\nthe comedy there will be a disco until\nlam with a late bar until midnight.\nThe final event of the week is the\nFreshers' Ball. (It is called the Freshers'\nBall but try not to wear dinner jackets\netc\u2014people will only laugh at you.) It is\nvery similar to tonight's event but with\nsome bands in the Concert Hall.\nThe main band, headlining the whole\nweek, is the excellent James Taylor\nQuartet. With a string of LPs all with\nexcellent reviews, IC are lucky to have\nthis most famous of Acid Jazz' bands.\nThey have played at IC once before and\nwe had to turn away scores of people. In\nmy opinion the best act of the week.\nThey are no longer a quartet, now\nincluding a full bass section and some\nsingers (including a rapper). The last\nsingle was remixed by Jazzy B( of Sou/ //\nSoul). Their sound inspired bands that are\ngetting big today, eg Charlatans, Inspiral\nCarpets, but that classic hammond organ\nsound, recently used with the\nWonderstuff on tour, still predominates.\nAlso on the bill are TTje Trudy. After an\nimpressive show here last year they are\nback with their own brand of psychedelic\npop. Make sure you have your dancing\ntrousers on as they have a reputation that\nthey can make people who normally\nwouldn't dance!\nDownstairs in the Lounge we have\nff\nWEEK\nDeath Bang Party and Boy Girl Soup.\nDeath Bang Party are the most\noutrageous and energetic party band on\nthe circuit at the moment. They also\nplayed here last year and the finale to\nthe show was very special indeed. A band that needs to be seen to be\nbelieved.\nBoy Girl Soup will be releasing their\nfirst single soon: newcomers to the scene,\nbut a very new and original sound. Check\nthem out.\nBurgers, Cocktail Bar, late bar until\n2am and a Disco will, of course, be\nincluded in the event. There will also be\na free minibus service home for women.\nThe price of a week ticket for all three\nevents is \u00a310. The Monday and Friday\nCarnivals are \u00a35 each and the Comedy\nNight is \u00a33.50, so obviously you can save\n\u00a33.50 if you buy a week ticket. Also the\nevents will probably sell out very quickly,\nso to ensure entrance to all the events a week ticket is your best bet.\nAfter Freshers' Week, Ents is still very\nbusy. The next gig will be in the Lounge,\nthe first of regular Lounge gigs. Spirit of\nEcstasy and Miss American will both be\nplaying; they are in the Manchester ilk of\nbands. Details will follow soon.\nAs well as this, every Wednesday in the\nLounge will be a free disco: somewhere\nto let your hair down and get sweaty to a few tunes.\nAll this entertainment can cost you\nvery little if you purchase an Ents card.\nThese cards are a mere \u00a37 and give you\na discount on all the events; sometimes\nyou can even get in free. If you have\nalready ordered a card, then these can be\ncollected from the Ents stall at Freshers'\nFair.\nIf you would like to join the Ents\ncommittee, it is very simple. Ents kids are\na group of students who put on events in\nthe Union. It is unpaid and it helps if you\nare hardworking, but having said that it\nis very rewarding. If you would like to\njoin up, it is free: simply chat to us at the\nFreshers' Fair or talk to us at any of the\ngigs. We are friendly and some of us are\ninteresting. Ents is undoubtedly the best\nsociety at College.\nEnjoy Freshers Week!\nBJ, Ents Chair.\nFRESHERS' WEEK\nat the\nUNION BAR We shall be open between the\nfollowing times, to support\nUnion events\nSun 30th Noon-2.00pm7.00 pm10.00 pm Mon 1st Noon-2.00am Tue 2nd Noon-11.00pm Wed 3rd Noon-2.00pm5.30 pm Midnight\nThu 4th Noon-2.00pm5.30 pml1.00 pm Fri 5th Noon-2.00am Sat 6th Noon-2.00pm5.30 pml1.00 pm "

What more can I say?\nYou've made it, you've filled in the UCC A form, attended the interviews, toured the\nuniversities, passed your exams and made\nyour decision. Unfortunately, it was the\nwrong decision: you're at Imperial\nCollege.\nI hate to be the one who has to give\nyou the bad news, but for the next three\nor four years you will be an inmate at an\novergrown boys' public school clustered\naround a suspiciously phallic-looking\ntower in the middle of one of the\nexpensive and self-important areas of\nLondon. You have been had.\nBut you must not be downhearted; you\nmust, as the Rector invariably says, use\nthis unique opportunity to learn. Men:\nyou will experience whole new vistas of\nsexual frustration and alcohol-induced\nnausea. Women, you will begin to\nunderstand what it is like to be leered at\nby a dozen lager-swilling sex-fiends each\nof whom thinks that 'do you come here\noften' is an original chat-up line. Gays,\nlesbians, blacks and anyone else not on\nthe Sun's list of normal people: you will\nbeloved as he gently and carefully tucks\nit away every night, for he knows that\none day, one blessed day, he will find a use for it.\nYet Macho Man and his Brut-laden ilk\nare but a small, if distinctive, minority.\nThey are outnumbered by a species more\ndevastating and terrible. These are the\npeople you will be sick of the sight of by\nthe middle of the first week: the dreaded,\nall-pervasive enthusiasts.\nThe enthusiast is that man who is still\nwearing his departmental sweatshirt two\nyears after everyone else has burnt\ntheirs. He is the secretary to half a dozen\nclubs and publicity officer for another ten.\nIt is he who, in an effort to maintain a balanced outlook on life, joins both the\nConservative Society and the Socialist\nWorkers group and who stands for every\nplace on the Hall committee. He believes\nthat the post of Student Union Transport\nOfficer is on a par with Deputy-Assistant\nGod.\nBut these are just minor flaws: what\nreally makes you long to reduce him to a mess on the carpet is the true enthusiast's inability to understand that that look of\npain and horror which crawls across your\nface whenever you and he meet is\nbecause he bores you senseless.\nrunning for the door before\nyou can say 'satanism'.\nIndeed, saying 'satanism'\nquite frequently helps\nspeed them on their way.\nApart from the slight but\never-present danger of\nbeing burnt at the stake,\nthese simple techniques could keep you religion free for years.\nImperial College is less of a place than\na deranged state of mind: there are times\nwhen the students and staff merge into a homogeneous grey mass where it is\nimpossible to tell one from the other. You are guaranteed to meet the enthusiast-turned-lecturer, the man who did his BSc,\nMSc, PhD and driving-test at IC and who feels that his chosen specialised subject,\nthe Mating Habits of the Cassowary, can\nbe used to illustrate every single point\nfrom every single course. This is doubly\nirritating if he is meant to be teaching\nMechanical Engineering.\nHis opposite number, the member of\nstaff who is 'still as too dent at heart', is\nas bad: there are many good reasons for\nfailing to understand a course, but having\na lecture interrupted by the lecturer for a chat about the music of Stock-Aitken and\nWaterboard should not be one of them.\nit's a beautiful place have perfect chance to grasp the\npracticalities of prejudice. It's that kind of\nplace.\nImperial College is chronically\npredictable. Iam convinced that\nsomewhere in a dark dank dingy lab in\nthe dimmest recesses of an obscure\ndepartment, a mad scientist is producing\nstudents to order. Wherever you go and\nwhatever you do, you will meet the same\npeople doing the same things in the same\nway, usually badly.\nYou will certainly meet 'Macho Man',\ntall, dark and firmly convinced that he is\nhandsome: his hair is distorted with hairspray and combed into a qui ff that would\nembarrass a unicorn. He wears a toupee\non his chest and smells like a bomb blast\nat a chemist. Macho Man's one topic of\nconversation is himself and consists\nentirely of implausible and highly-fictionalised accounts of the 'girls wot I have screwed'.\nWhat is special about Macho Man is his\nreligion. Unlike the Muslims, the Jews or\nthe Christians, Macho Man follows no\nomnipresent supreme being: his object of\nveneration hangs, limply, between his\nlegs. He is a true believer: there is no\ndoubting the love he relishes upon his\nYou will see an enthusiast on every\nstall at Freshers' Fair, looking after the\nmembership lists with all the intense\nseriousness of a soldier guarding the\nCrown Jewels. One may come up to you\nwhile you are wandering between\nbuildings, and thrust a pamphlet into your\nhands. Be warned, you must always\nremember that, although enthusiasts seem\nharmless and can be quite entertaining in\nsmall doses, you should never, ever be\nfooled into saying 'oh! that's interesting'.\nYou will live to regret it.\nClosely related to the enthusiast are the\ngod-squad der s: so clean living, clean\nlooking and clean thinking that they must\nhave soap powder for brains. A god-squad der will target his victim with care:\nhe will make a bee-line for the poor sod\nstanding on his own by the door and,\nstretching his smile as wide as it will go,\nsay T believe in Jesus' in that sweet,\nangelic, sincere vio ice that makes you long to conduct a black mass on the spot.\nUnlike IC's other mass-produced\nirritants, god-squad der s are avoidable.\nOld, reliable methods, such as painting\nthe number 666 on your forehead and\nwandering around mumbling the Lord's Prayer backwards, will have them\nPeople have been known to survive a course at IC with only superficial injuries\nand many recover completely within only\na decade or so. Some, however, are\ninfected beyond redemption. These poor\ngrey-eyed, grey-faced bland non-entities\nhave no choice but to take up a career in\naccountancy.\nAdvice? What can I say? Stay here and\nsample the delights you missed by not\ngoing to St Bugger's School for the\nChildren of the Rich and Gullible. Don't let the bastards get you down. In fact,\ndon't let the bastards get you anywhere,\njoin the queue for the Sociology Degree\nat the Nether-Wallop Polytechnic.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Jason Lander became so disgruntled and\ndisillusioned with IC that he is trying to\nbecome a Weather Forecaster.

After being born in West Kensington, he grew up in\nWimbledon, however he bares little resemblance to Uncle Bulgaria, or Tobbermore although his\noffice is sometimes scattered with papers. It is quite a time since Paul came to College (1985 to\nbe honest). This is mainly due to his merry ment while at College and his annual argument with\nthe Maths Department following examinations. While at College he has been a re-app in\nHolbein House and U GM Chairman. During one of his 'off years he worked in the College\nAlumni Office. Shan's responsibilities include insurance, overseas students, transport and \u00bb*\"\u2022\u00bb\u2022\u2022.-\u2022\u2022\u00bb\nparking, and welfare. He is also your representative on various College committees. As the\nfigurehead of the Union he actually does bugger all relying on us to do the\ndonkey work. Therefore if you have any problems he won't mind\n(honest) if you go into his office and have a chat. That's if he's there\nand is not attending another freebee as the Presidents;. Shan's 'interest' is golf.\nShan on Ben: Benjamin is useless. Half the time you can't find\nhim\u2014the other half he's trying to get his leg over some American or Italian bit. Talking of Italians, his girlfriend is far too good for\nhim. He never uses deodorant. He has the dress sense of a rabid\nparrot. Benjamin or 'Wanker' to those who know him (who aren't his friends because they all hate him), looks like Charlie Chan. He\nclaims to be from Northern Ireland whereas his accent is\nreminiscent of a polar bear who has learnt English via\nLinguaphone. He doesn't fart, smoke tabs or drink beer.\nOccasionally he drinks tw at Southern Comfort which gets him\nvery drunk because he can't hold his drink. All in all, he's a nasty\nbit of work. Vote sensibly, vote New Election.\nBen on Murray: If you need to find Murray Bruce McGregor\nWilliamson, the one place you should look is in the Union Bar.\nHe's spent four years at Imperial College studying BEER. In his\nspare time he did some Mechanical Engineering. Murray has been\nan eternal member of College Wine Committee; strange, 'cos he\nlikes BEER. A sC&G Ents Officer, Murray has been heavily\ninvolved in-Field Cup. While other team members stole signs and\ncaused mayhem, Murray concentrated on the BEER. Murray has\norganised a C&G Cocktail Party.\nCocktail Party. Everyone drank cocktails, but Murray brought his\nown barrel of BEER. He's been heavily involved in C&G Motor\nClub\u2014shame, no BEER. At least, not until after he's finished\ndriving. Murray has numerous pots in the Union Bar. He drinks\nBEER from them.\nShan on Chris: Chris has had his ups and downs whilst at College. The ups have been passing\nexams\u2014the downs have been failing them. Chris has had more downs than ups. Besides failing\nhis exams, Chris has also had a miserable sex life. His fetish for leather has repulsed many a fair maiden and a few of the boys as well. The height of Chris's College career was his\nunsuccessful attempt to scale the Science Museum in his second year. This endeavour was\nhalted midway by Inspector Plod who invited Chris back to his place. Apart from\nmaking our life hell by asking for articles and having to run a new election, Chris is\na very amiable chap. Even after working all Thursday night he often manages to smile\n\n"

The hall is a new development\nwhich will eventually accommodate 405\nstudents in 1 to 4 bedroom houses and\nflats. The hall is being partly financed by\nthe sale of Montpelier Hall and new\narrangements for a postgraduate hall are\nbeing considered. The first students\nshould be able to move in at the end of\nthis year.\nBoth the College and the Union\nBuilding have been plagued by a number\nof thefts over the summer. \u00a338 was stolen\nfrom the till in the Union Bar, while the\ndoor to an office rented out to an\nAmerican Students Organisation was\nforced and a cash box containing \u00a3300\nwas taken. A float of \u00a3250 was taken\nduring a Salvation Army conference\nbeing held in the Union Building.\nPersonal possessions belonging to a film\ncrew shooting an advertisement were\ntaken from an unattended, unlocked\ndressing room and STOIC suffered the\nloss of a video camera from their studios.\nThere have been a number of changes\nin Union Permanent Staff over the\nsummer. Laurens Alexander was sacked\nas manager of the Bookstore for\n'unacceptable conduct'. Last year's Union\nPresident Neil McCluskey has been\nappointed on a short term contract to\nThe most serious theft of the summer\noccurred when \u00a315,000 worth of platinum\ncrucibles were stolen from a safe in the\nMaterials Department which had been\nopened with the key.\nGood news for students beset by\nstudent loans and the loss of benefits was\nthe announcement of the Access Fund,\nwhich is intended to fund students who\nwould not come to university for financial\nreasons. The NUS and ULU believe the\nmoney should be used to support the loss\nof benefits. Imperial is to receive\n\u00a3250,000 and the money is to be used\nprimarily to help students who are self-financing, parent ally estranged, disabled\nor with families. Undergraduate\nclaims will be made by applying\nto Senior Tutors.\nreplace him while a permanent manager\nis sought. Also sacked was Andy Knight\nas Assistant Union Bar Manager following\nhis failure to lock up the front door of the\nbar. A previous Assistant Bar Manager,\nAndrew Carson, who disappeared last\nJanuary with \u00a31430 from the Union Bar,\nhas been found guilty of fraud and\nfeigning to defraud in Snaresbrook\nMagistrates Court, but the Union will\nreceive no compensation for the money\ntaken.\nLeaving the Bar for more pleasant\nreasons is Adrian 'Jelly' Johnson, who has\nworked there for three years. He is to\nstudy Mineral Resources Engineering in\nthe Royal School of Mines having\ndropped out of the Aeronautical\nEngineering Department before working\nfor the Union. He is being replaced as\nManager by John Riding, previously the\nBar Steward; Tracy Sedgwick will become\nthe Bar Steward.\nA new member of the Union\nPermanent Staff is Chris Stapleton, who\nhas been appointed to the temporary post\nof Print Unit Production Manager after\nfailing his exams and being unable to\ntake up the sabbatical post of FELIX\nEditor. He will continue in the role until\nelections have been held at the beginning\nof term for a new Editor. The three\nUnion Office Sabbaticals, President Paul\nShanley, Deputy President Benjamin\nTurner and Honorary Secretary Murray\nWilliamson, all passed their final\nexaminations and gained their degrees.\nThere were some notable misfortunes\nwithin College.

    "content": "Some children are always putting their hands up to answer questions. But the teacher must be very careful to avoid the temptation to respond to the same ones all the time.\nWHY SHOULD THE TEACHER\nASK THE CHILD ON THE RIGHT?\nThe teacher should never discourage the keen ones, of course.\nBut those like the boy on the right of our picture need attention\ntoo. He may not have put his hand up for a number of reasons.\nMAYBE he didn't put his hand up because he\n. didn't hear the question. Or maybe he\ndidn't understand the way it was put. But he\nmay also be one of those children who are persistently shy about answering questions, whether\nthey understand them or not.\nEven if he knows the right answer, he may\nbe so worried about getting it wrong that he\njust doesn't want to risk it. (This can be just as\ntrue of a gifted child, by the way, as it can of a slower one.)\nIn that case, the teacher must take the time\nto help him build up his confidence. By asking a simpler question, one the teacher is sure he\nknows the answer to, perhaps. Or by giving the\nchild a choice of answers and reducing his\nchances of getting it wrong.\nEvery child in the class has his or her own\nunique difficulties and needs. As a teacher, you\nmust learn to recognise them and do your best\nto help all your pupils realise their potential.\nYou have to be able to think on your feet, continually adapting your lesson in response to the\nfeedback you get from them.\nThat is why, even if you are teaching the\nsame material, no two lessons are ever the\nsame. And any teacher will tell you how satisfying\nit is to see children develop not only in terms of\ntheir knowledge and intellectual capabilities, but\nalso in their confidence as people. For that is\nsurely just as important as academic success to\nhelp them get on in life.\nIf you are interested in a career in teaching,\nand would like more information, ring 0345\n300121 quoting Department code IMP or fill in\nthe coupon opposite.\nFor information about a career as a teacher, pi ease complete this\ncoupon in block letters and send to: Teacher Recruitment,\nDept.

    "content": "jU False Alarm Original\nIn issue 874 the story 'Asbestos Attack'\nwas factually incorrect as it stated that\nDesmond Heatherington had been\ndiagnosed as suffering from Asbestosis.\nThe article should have said that\nMr. Heatherington had personally stated\nthat he had contracted the condition and\nthat no confirmation had been received\nfrom his doctor at that time. We\napologise to his relatives for any distress\ncaused by the article and offer our\ncondo lances for their loss.\nFollowing the publication of that\nFriday's edition. Dr Swan communicated\nwith FELIX and sent a statement\nconcerning Health and Safety at work.\nIssued by Dr. Swan on behalf of Dr. R. Gillon, Director of the Health Centre, it\nreads:\n\"There has been a programme for\nasbestos control in the college since 1980.\nWhere we know asbestos has been used\nor where it is discovered during\nmaintenance or building work the\nasbestos has been sealed to make it safe,\nor if this is impractical, arrangements are\nmade for the asbestos to be safely\nremoved by specialist contractors. If\nmaintenance staff come across any\nmaterial in their work which they think\nmay pose an asbestos hazard they are\nadvised to report it to a designated\nmember of the surveying staff who\nassesses the problem and arranges for the\nasbestos to be sealed or removed as\nappropriate before work commences.\nWe consider this programme adequate\nto ensure members of college are not\nplaced at risk of asbestos related disease\nand we are not aware of any member of\nthe college staff, either past or present,\nwho have been exposed to dangerous\namounts of asbestos in their work or\ndeveloped an illness as a result of\nasbestos exposure. If this did happen we\nwould investigate it as a matter of\nurgency to identify and advise others\nwho may have been at risk and to\nprevent any further dangerous exposures\noccurring.\"\nDrama\nDuring this year's Edinburgh Fringe, Neil\nMotteram, an ex-student, put on one of\nhis school friends' plays, Leatherhead.\nDavid Allen, the writer, also acted in the\nplay, a work that \"incorporates original\npoetry into a psychological drama.\" The\nplay was beset with troubles, including a cast member walking out and numerous\nscript changes.\nIn a review entitled \"Fringe cringe\",\nJohn Vidal of the Guardian described\nLeatherhead as \"the worst play on the\nfringe\".\nA short extract:\nB ARMAN:I see you're still following\nyour path of urban realism.\nSUSIE: I take photos of the homeless and\nthen 1 go to bed.\nFAN: I think she's got a point.\nStudent Loans You will probably be aware of the\nstudent loan system due to its bad\npublicity last year and the advertisements\nappearing around London at the moment.\nThe Government has increased the grant\nthis year for the last time and is\nintroducing a loan in the Autumn term to\ncover what should have been further\ngrant increases.\nAny student receiving a mandatory\ngrant (college fees paid) can apply for a loan. This loan will not be interest-free as\nsome of the banks are offering, but will\nbe index-linked.\nRather than hand out loans to every\nstudent, the government has invented a bureaucracy ridden application system in\nan attempt to dissuade students from\nobtaining a loan.\nThe first step in applying for a loan is\nto visit the Registry to establish eligibility.\nStudent loans are being dealt with in\nRoom 345 on level 3 of the Sherfield\nBuilding, opening hours are Monday,\nWednesday and Thursday 11.45am3.15 pm It is important to bring with you the\nfollowing items:\na) Students born in the United Kingdom\nneed a birth or adoption certificate.\nStudents born outside the United\nKingdom need a passport and a letter or\nother document from a responsible\nperson - a minister of religion, doctor,\nlawyer, teacher, established civil; servant,\npolice officer or consular officer - which\ncontains particulars of the\nstudent's date, place and country\nof birth and the student's names at birth.\nb)A letter of advice from a local\neducation authority confirming a mandatory award.\nc) Evidence of a bank/building society\naccount, i.e. the production of a cheque\nbook, passbook or bank statement which\nshows clearly the account number and\nsort code.\nWithout these documents requests for\nloans cannot be processed.\nOnce you have spent about ten minutes\nfilling in forms in the Registry you will be\ngiven another form to fill in by yourself.\nThis must be sent by you to the Student\nLoans Company.\nIf you receive a loan, what will you do\nwith it? If you pay income tax then a good place to put it is in a Nationwide\nAnglia Capital Bonus account. This is a high interest account only allowing access\nafter three months notice. If you are a non-taxpayer (i.e. your earnings total less\nthan \u00a33005 pa) one of the best places to\nput it is in a National Savings Investment\nAccount, obtainable at post offices.\nThe Investment Account requires one\nmonth's notice for with drawl. Unlike most\nbank and building society accounts,\nhowever, tax is not deducted at source\nallowing non-taxpayers to benefit from\nthe high interest rate of 12.75% pa. This\nmeans that nearly everybody at\nuniversity will benefit from taking a loan\nand investing it in this way.\nVs1 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 mm \u2022\nlite \u2122\n\u2022 :\n... - \u2022 :\n:\n:;::\n:;r:. \u2022\u2022 ' i1||||$j| \u00a7 3*\nHB IQfr\n\u2022yip*'\n\n"

    "content": "High Powered\nOver the weekend of 8/9th September a high-tension power cable was routed\nthrough the ICSF (Imperial College\nScience Fiction) Library causing damage\nin the process. The cable was planned to\ngo around the library to feed the new\nlaboratories being built within the west\nwing of Beit Hall.\nInstead of referring to Beit security for\na key, the contractors sawed around the\nlock in the door frame to gain entry to\nthe library. Once inside, they cut another\nhole through the side panel of the door\nto provide a route for the cable. They\nthen proceeded to knock out a corner in\nthe ceiling to enable the cable to turn the\ncorner above the door, screwed the cable\nto the ceiling and drilled an excessively\nlarge hole through the side wall as an\nexit point.\nWhen finished, the contractors screwed\nthe lock back into the door from the\noutside, leaving the library in a totally\ninsecure state, as well as an\nunsatisfactory one. The library contains\nover SI0,000 worth of books.\nSteven Newhouse, the chairman of ICSF\nand Ben Turner, Deputy President,\ncomplained to Roy Adams, the Senior\nDepartmental Superintendent for Biology\nduring the following week but it was not\nuntil the 24th September that all repairs\nhad been completed, the cable had been\nre-routed to its intended position and the\nlibrary door re-painted.\nThe cost of these repairs will be\ncharged to the contractors but FELIX\ncould not ascertain the amount or the\nfirm involved.\nRobbed!\nOver the weekend the FELIX office was\nbroken into. The glass window of the\nFELIX door was smashed and \u00a310\nremoved from the petty cash box.\nNothing else was taken and the outside\ndoor into the Quad was left locked. On\nMonday fingerprints were taken from the\nFELIX office and the window was\nrepaired that afternoon.\nLock Out\nYet again, Southside security has foiled\nattempts by residents to reach their\nrooms: last Thursday the outside locks to\nSouthside were changed without warning.\nThe locks are changed each year to avoid\nprior residents re-entering the building\nbut students returning late on Thursday\nnight were let in by security without\nhaving to prove they had a room and\nwithout having to show identification.\nWhen questioned, the housekeeper\nstated that this was the required action\nfor residents to take but there are no\nnotices to this effect at Southside.\nFor several days last week Beit Arch was\ncluttered with a large pile of rubbish.\nOnly after an anonymous source had\ntipped off the council about the health\nhazard and Ben Turner, the Deputy\nWelcome\nThe National Untion of Students (NUS)\nhave donated to the Union 3500\nunwanted Student Welcome packs.

    "content": "Mozart: The Magic\n24 August E.N.O. London Coloseum\nIn Peter Shaffer's award-winning\nAmadeus, Mozart's wife, Constanze, was\nshown to have declared, 'Twelve foot\nsnakes? Magic flutes? Your libretto is\nridiculous!' She was talking about\nEmanuel Schikaneder's text for what was\nto become the last and perhaps the most\naccessible opera of the greatest composer\nto have ever lived. At one level, it is a story of love, morals, magic and\ntraditional good versus evil; a pantomime\nfor all the family, where darkness\ncontrasts starkly against light, with our\nheroes treading the dangerous path\ntowards the latter. More subtly, it had a political message, defending the tenets of\nFreemasonry at a time when it was under\nsevere threat in Austria: a cause very\nclose to both composer's and librettist's hearts.\nIn brief synopsis, a prince, Tamino, is\ntold by the Queen of the Night how her\ndaughter, Pamina, is held captive by\nSarastro. Tamino and Papageno, the\nQueen's comical bird-catcher, set off to\nsave her, armed with a magic flute,\nenchanted bells and three boys to help\nthem on their quest. Tarnino is led to\nSarastro's Temple of Nature, Reason and\nWisdom by the Three Boys and is warned\nby a speaker there how the Queen and\nnot Sarastro, is evil. This is confirmed by\nPamina when they meet for the first time\ntowards the end of the first act. After\nundergoing trials to enter the\nBrotherhood of Isis, Tamino and Pamina\nare united and, although Papageno fails\nto enter, he too finds a beautiful bride,\nPapagena. The Queen, her three\nattendants and a Moor called\nMonostatos\u2014 previously a servant of\nSarastro, but banished from the temple\nafter twice attempting to rape Pamina\u2014\nplot to kill Sarastro, but are destroyed by\nthe strength of love. The opera ends in a triumphant chorus declaring that strength\nhas conquered.\nThe English National Opera has a reputation of excellence, and this revival\nof Nicholas Hytner's1988 production\ncertainly lives up to such standards. The\norchestra, conducted by Jane Glover, play\nin a clean and lively fashion from the\nopening masonic chords to the very end,\nanticipating mood and expression with\ntight control over volume and texture,\nand are a credit to Mozart's music.\nWhen the curtain first lifts, we see\nTamino, played by Neitl Archer,, in the\ncoils of the snake standing on a mirrored\nfloor and surrounded by a curved, whitewashed wall. It is a clinical chamber,\nimplying a place free of human emotion,\nwhere the morals of the story could be\nargued out. A jagged crack in the wall\nopens to reveal the outside world in vivid\ncolours that contrast from scene to scene,\nand through it, the characters come and\ngo, treating the chamber as a divine\ncourt room.\nThe costume is vaguely of the late\nEighteenth Century, except when dealing\nwith the Brotherhood of Isis, when it\nreverts back to Ancient Egypt, as do the\nprops and stage backings Overall the\nstage design and use of colour is very\neffective and well worthy of praise. The\nsimple elegance of the scenery is retained\nin the second act when the stage receives\na new dimension\u2014the vertical\u2014used\nmasterfully. The hero and heroine do\nindeed descend to the deeps, there is\nhumour in Papageno's floating love-nest,\nand the surprising entrances within the\ntemple walls and columns.\nThe translation by Jeremy Sams\nmagically retains all the sparkle and wit\nof the libretto, though occasionally,\nexpression's such as 'girl-friend' seem\nrather garish for such delicate discourse\nas this. Undoubtedly, though, translation\nof such a piece is a very difficult task,\nand hearing an eight year-old girl in the\naudience laugh delighted ly at Papageno's Curl Up & Dye\nTricycle Theatre\nThe last time I was in Kilburn 1 visited\none of the many curry houses, washed\nmy Vindaloo down with copious\nquantities of beer and on ordering a pint\nat a nearby Irish pub was horrified to find\nthat the whole place went silent just as I had opened my mouth. It's a rough area\nno doubt, but the Tricycle Theatre (289.\nKilburn High Road) stands out. A major\nvenue on the 'London Fringe', it\nconsistently produces new and by and\nlarge quality drama. Curl Up and Dye\nfresh from the Edinburgh Fringe, is no\nexception.\nSusan Pam (who also plays the lead\nrole) has written a revealing\ncomedy about the attitudes and anxieties\nthat will continue to underlay South\nAfrican society, long after apartheid has\ngone. Rolene, manager ess of a seedy hair\nsalon (Curl Up and Dye International) in a dilapidated 'grey area' is a most touching\nFlute\nbanter, it was obvious that Mr Sams has\nsucceeded wonderfully. The production\nitself is also imaginative and skilful,\nindeed the entire audience could not help\nbut laugh as a white dove flew to\nPapageno's cage at each beckoning of his\npipes.\nIt was not just the translation and\neffects which made the little girl laugh;\nBenjamin Luxon, who plays the role of\nPapageno, is a skilful actor as well as\nbaritone, in the same way as the rest of\nthe cast seems to have mastered the art\nof singspiel. Particular mention should be\nmade of Nan Christie, who plays the\nQueen, and was able to reach the high F in her two arias so effortlessly, and\nthoroughly deserved her rich applause.\nThe Three Boys sung with such clarity\nand precision that they too should be\ncongratulated. The diction was\nimmaculate throughout, but a few notes\ndid seem too low for John Connell\nplaying Sarastro as the volume noticeably\ndropped, and at times the orchestra and\nperformers did not enter or finish in\nexact unison.\nIn today's society, the success of a production lies in the overall effect and\nnot solely the musical preciseness of the\nperformance. If the latter is all that is\nrequired, then there are many excellent\nrecordings publicly available. At a live\nperformance, the visual impression is\nequally vital as the aural, and in this the\nENO excels. With its innovative style and\ndesire to show that opera is alive and\nentertaining, and not just a status symbol\nfor the high-browed, the ENO has\nimpressed. Many who visit find\nthemselves somewhat surprised at the\naccessibility and entertainment of their\nproductions. Of course, it is expensive,\nbut at the same time, well worth the\nmoney. The ENO has brought the opera\nback to the people, where it belongs, so\nwhy not see for yourself?\nexample of how poor whites tend to\nscapegoat everything onto the blacks\nwhen it is themselves, or rather 'society'\nthat is to blame. After a somewhat slow\nand flabby first half, the five contrasting\nfemale characters combined to create apa cy and painfully funny conclusion\nwhich really brought Pam's message\nhome. The audience's spontaneous\napplause after a desperate speech from\nRolene's black assistant goes to show that\nnot all shows these days have punters\nsitting robot-like in their seats. Forget\nthe curry, go to some Vindaloo Theatre\ninstead. ir^V Adrian Pagan. K fli "

What was to be expected from a two-year creative silence?\nThe record was slapped eagerly onto\nthe turntable to hear what mind\nbombardment we were to be blessed\nwith. The intro to this eight and a half\nminute epic crescendo ed, as the office\nclam our ed for more. What we got was...\nThe orchestral lead built on to the\ntypically hard bass and drum spine,\nrelished with a much smoother Andrew Eldritch than before. However, following\nthe Nephilim's triumphal release, this was\ndisappointingly bland. Andrew himself\nadmits in the lyrics, 'Some people get by\nwith a whole lot more' and many will\nwish that he himself DID more. More is a turgid and repetitious drone of a hard\nbeat and race y guitar which would have\nprovided the basis of an epic, but does\nnot stand well alone. After the skillful\ncomplexity of Floodland, More retains\nonly the thought but not the deed. It does\nindeed need more.\nAfter this disappointment, the B side,\nYou Could Be The One shows that the\nSister's prowess is not latent but active,\nthis is almost a masterpiece with power,\nrock, rumbles, re verb, massed choirs,\n-'aria tion and, gasp, MAJOR CHORDS! It's well worth buying the 7\" just for this flip,\nand we are assured that it won't be on\nthe album. More is released today on East\nWest Records.\nFinally, the record company says of\ntheir forthcoming gigs\u2014'be there or wait\nanother five years for God and all His\nangels to make that funny exploding\nnoise in your head again.'\nSJH\nRuff Ruff &Ready The Levellers\nA Weapon Called the Word\nTribal Mutation 7\"\nThis band are just waiting to stomp on\nthe ears of any apathetic student or\nprecocious politician. If they act as\naggressively and stirring ly live as they\nsound, old Imperialists should start\nbuilding their bomb shelters now. They\nreek and rock of a new social stand.\nTribal Mutation is littered with agile\nbag-pipes, Rotten rap and an insatiable\nscream of punk defiance and wah-wah\nscream against social stereotypes.\nThe double-A, American Rappers,\ndeserves a place at No 1. London raps\nAmerica, and crushes politics with DMs. It\nis rounded off by a Tribal Reprise. The\nHouse bagpipes and trumpets give a violent rave for a new punk generation of\ntoday's music.\nPlay this at the next Anti-Poll Tax rally\nor Conservative Party Conference for a riot.\nSJH\nm8| Maybe I'm wrong. Call me wie rd if you\nwant, but leaving all he good stuff to the\nend of the album and shoving the dross\nat the beginning seems like a Bad Idea.\nThe first five tracks are very mediocre\nfolksy type music that totally fails to hold\none's attention. The best that can be said\nof them is that they would make\nadequate background music while\nstruggling with a problem sheet. Not\nanything that you would sit and listen to,\nor even, heaven forbid, dance to.\nThe Trudy\nDestination Love\nSinger Melissa sounds still more like\nDebbie Harry on vinyl and the whole\nseems so tame when compared to the\nsearing s ponte ne it y of their live act. The\nsingle only goes to prove that The Trudy\nare best appreciated during the cosmic\nspangle and scorching crazy ness on stage.\nThe swinging single often seems more\nappropriate to a film soundtrack depicting\na swooning sixties heroine than befits this\ninfamously zany band and does not do\nthem justice. However Melissa's strong\nLondon accent gives a biting contrast to\nher 'oh-so-American' sweet singing lilt. It\nalso heralds a return to the walking bass\nand jazzy keyboards.\nAltogether a jolly good boog y and not\nto be missed at this week's Freshers'\nNight.\nSJH\nLP\nSuddenly, without warning Three\nFriends leap out of your 3D super woofer\nand tear you away from that particularly\ndifficult equation that made sense in the\nlecture but...\nYou find yourself screwing up your\neyes and ears, respectively trying to read\nthe inlay and listen to the music to find\nout what this stuff is all about. Hey, admit\nit, you're interested.\nThe second side really picks up where\nthe first left off, and tracks like No\nChange and England My Home are really\nrather good. In puzzlement you listen to\nthe first side again. Sorry still duff.\nDefinitely a game, err, album of two\nsides, Brian, but none the worse for it.\nAdam T. "
