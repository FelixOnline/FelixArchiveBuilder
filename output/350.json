This is because the facts are so\noverwhelmingly clear.\nThe Bible, Tacitus, Pliny\nand Thai lus all witness to Jesus Christ as being\nfor more than a mere\nman. One of the most over-w hel ming pieces of evidence is the accuracy of\nprophecy in the Bible, even to this very day.\nJesus Christ fulfilled\ncountless messages of\nprophecy during his life\non earth, particularly lucid are those concerning his death and resurrect ion. The evidence for\nChrist's resurrection has\nnever been satisfactorily\nexplained away, despite\nmany attempts. These\nare doomed to failure,\nbecause the facts speak\nfor themselves, they say\nthat Jesus lis who He\nsaid He was, the Son of\nGod. The facts about\nChrist are as solid as\nany upon which we do\nour scientific research\nand yet people still\navoid the issue instead\nof facing it head on. This\nis in fact further evidence that Jesus is\nsomething special. The final evidence is\nwhen a man comes into\na personal relationship\nwith Christ, then he can say \"I know Jesus is\nalive today and loves me\". If anyone seriously\ndoubts this we suggest,\nbefore wasting more\nspace in Felix, that they\nlook very carefully at the\nfacts with an open and\n(for you, All) a truly\nscientific mind. We welcome anybody to come and talk to us about this\nand we will share with them what we know and have discovered since\nwe asked Jesus Christ into our lives as Saviour\nand Lord.\nMaurice Moloney Chem3 Anne Moloney Chem3 Digby James 'Chem 3\nChristine Little IF. Yours\npatronising ly, etc.\nSir,\nHaving been shown the article in your college magazine on the\n' Historical roots of religion'1 feel I must register my total disagreement with almost all the\nideas put forward by Mr. Ve all. He appears to have\nlimited experience of the\ndeep-seated origins of\nreligion. It is not a subject to be summed Up lightly as Mr. Ve all believes by briefly discus sing a few historical oc-cur rence s. Without delving too\ndeeply into What | regard\nas the truth in this matter ('the truth' as Oscar Wilde so rightly says 'is\nrarely pure and never\nsimple') so I would merely recommend Mr. Veall to read Bethan's' Analysis of Religion' be fore he discusses this\nmatter again.\nRev. David Harding. Racism\nSir,\nI have just been reading a copy of the recent-ly published IC Rag Mag.I feel I must raise my voice in protest about\none of the articles included in it.\nSurely, as 'intelligent'\nstudents, we should be striving to break down the barriers of racial hat-red, exploitation and prejudice that were created by our ' Colonial Heritage'. Yet one item\nin the magazine (on page\n22, I believe) blatantly\nsets out to insult Black People. I wonder What\nimpression of we so-cal-led intellectual and liberal whites this will leave with some of the overseas students who are studying at this college. O.K. Let's all have a good laugh \u2014 and let's raise money for charity\nat the same time; but\nNOT at the expense of\nbeing definitely uncharitable to oppressed minorities. Graham Kerwin. V Luv\nkisses\nLord Gnome\nEye Publications,\n3 4 Greek Street,\nLondon, W1.3 rd December.\nDear Sir, With reference to the\npublication of a quite obviously bogus correspondence, signed by aMr. B. McKenzie, in your\nquite obviously bogus\n'paper', I beg to inform\nyou that you will shortly\nbe hearing from our Solicitors, Mess rs.

Strobes,\npp Lord Gnome. Gnome VERY Wonderful Cast-Iron Guaranteed\nRip Off Company Inc.\nJock Veall\nwaters the\nwrong roots\nSir,\nI was much amused to\nread Jock Ve all' s expos i tion on the ' Historical Roots of Religion'. To\ndescribe the article as\n' drivel' would be paying it far too great a compliment for such a continuous flow of mis conceptions. Indeed so\nglaring are these misconceptions that if I were to\nbe told that Mr. Ve all possessed even the\nsmallest of brain cells\nI would not hesitate to\naccuse him of libel. Fortunately no one I 've met\nhas suggested that he\nhas any brain at all so\nI can refer to his errors\nas misconceptions. In his article Mr. Ve all places in block capitals\n\" Religion is false consciousness\". At first\nsight such a statement\nseems so meaningless\nthat it appears to be 'im-possible to argue for or\nagainst such a concept.\nPerhaps this is his in ten tion. However, in reading\nthe preamble to this\nsweeping phrase one\nfinds him talking of the\n'fundamental contradictions between man and nature' as ' man wanting to control nature but na ture not wanting to be\ncontrolled by man'. This contradiction we are told leads to the evolution of\nreligion. Really? I shall not go on as I do not wish to be too critical so I shall leave the\nsummary to Mr. Ve all himself. He refers to ' a fantastic force outside of\nhis control'. It seems\nthat he was aptly describing his own capability to discuss this topic.\nNigel Foster.\nTUESDAY,11 th DE C:12.55BBC News!\n13.00 The Liquidator!\nA film starring Rod Taylor.\nAdventure, women and\nmoney lure an ex-army sergeant into a life of killing\nfor MI5.\n\u00a3500\nfor\ndead\nstudents\nWe have now been\nable to final is e the arrangements for the\nGroup Personal Accident Policy.

The red lights from eager amplifiers pierced the gloomy\nblackness, dark shadows moved solemnly about\nas the opening strains of\n\" Pinball Wizard\" cried\nout into the merciless\nair. It soared and surged,\nto its inevitable climax and we awaited the massive bass notes, it drew\ncloser and closer and finally \u2014 KERS P LUNG!\"... Welcome to the\nshow, folks, welcome to\nthe show. We hope that\nwe will all be friends before it's time to go\". There stood the nine\nmembers of Grimm s adorned in clown hats\nand ruffs and we knew\nwe were in for a rare\ntreat \u2014 we were indeed.\nGrimm s really defy des-cri pti on. You could call\nthem a rock band, a group of poets, a set of\nclowns or comedians; you could, but to do so\nwould be inaccurate.\nThey are all this and more, they are an at mo sphere, a feeling, a ray\nof hope in this God-forsaken planet we call\nhome.\nGrimm s are entertain-ing, now that's a word you can't use about\nmany groups. They are\npure, complete and absolute entertainment, never\npredictable, never ever\nboring and absolutely a joy to watch. On the musical side the honours go to Neil Innes\nand Andy Roberts. Neil\nis an unrecognised\ngenius, he can play his\nguitar very competently\nand his various keyboards superbly; he can write and act in a totally\noriginal way. Who could resist him as he sat all alone on stage, playing\npiano whilst he sang the\ntitle song from his latest\nsolo album\" How sweet\nto be an idiot\". Andy Roberts is a virtuoso\nacoustic and electric\nguitar player, together\nwith Neil and Zoot\nMoney he holds the musical side of the act together and writes some\namazingly good music that would easily stand\nup on its own in a pure\nrock context. The rockin'. ' n' hop in' Zoot\nMoney was surprisingly\nsu due d in the first half\nof the show, but treated\nus to some tasty toons\nin the second half and is\nalso a very visual performer when he gets\ngoing. As well as the\nmusic, there's the poetry\nand no one can doubt\nRoger Mc Gough' s talents in this field. His works are a delight to\nlisten to, the short cryptic remarks, the deliberately corny puns, the\nword plays and long love\nstories all read out in his very sophisticated man ner, it's sheer poetry. If\nyou like Brian Patten's very individualistic style\nof writing and voice then\nhis poetry, although very\nimaginative and hard to\nunderstand, as read by\nhim the way it was in\ntended is totally captivating. On a couple of\noccasions the poems\nwere read over suitable\nmusical backgrounds,\nMc Gough' s\" Vampire\" and Patten's\" Prophet\" for example, and it\nworked so very well that\none wonders just why Grimm s is the only\nmusic-poetry group to\ncome to public notice.\nBut as well as the\nmusic and the poetry,\nthere is the comedy and here John Gorman, a natural comedian if ever\nthere was one, comes to\nthe fore. They have retained P.C. Plod, who is\nno longer worried about\nW.P. C. Hodges, but is\nmore concerned with\nmind-reading acts and telling us about \" a policeman' slot\". The sketches, in which Gorman was invariably involved, covered an obscure play, three priests,\n\" Bugger me, d'y a know What it s ez 'ere, it s ez that in three days he created the 'e aven and the earth\", a hilarious version of Deck of Cards.\n\" When I see the knave I think of Nixon and wo nder why he doesn't jack\nit in\",\" When I see the10, I think of No.10 Downing Street, when I see the Joker I think\nof the man who lives in\n. . . Although I missed Gorman' s interpretation\nof the roadie. Flash,\n\" Fue kin' hell, move the\nfuckin' thing yer fuckin' self, fuck you\", he was replaced by the man who put the word Die in\nDictionary \u2014 The Mask ed Poet. On leapt Gorman in a pseudo Batman \u2014 Dart outfit and proc ee ded to spout a mass\nof obscene poetry ( ? ) .\nHe also enlisted the help of some young ladies\nfrom the audience and after grappling with them burst into song with the rest of the band.\nThe backing( musically) was provided by\nGerry Conway( drums),\nDavid Richards (bass)\nand John M egg in son on\npiano, and they worked superbly well with the\nother six present. As I left clutching the\nGrimm sT shirt I had bought before and the\nalbum covers I had carefully ripped off the display stands after the\nconcert, it suddenly occurred to me that Mike Mc Gear hadn't. been\nthere. If they put on a show like that for 2\\\nhours without one of\ntheir major stars, and leave us stunned with a vaudeville acoustic number and8 foot Innes'\n\" Humanized Boogie\" as\na double encore and the\naudience still want more,\nthen it becomes obvious\nhow brilliant they are,\nso why do they keep appearing at the gro tty little Central Poly in stead of our huge, cap a city-filled Great Hall,\nMr. Ents Chairman? JEREMY BARKER About two years ago\na group of IC students\nfelt that they had heard\nenough of the problems\nof pollution, resource depletion and population\ngrowth to be convinced that these are real. With out denying the need for\nfurther discussions, political action and so on, this group decided to\nprovide a series of activities which would enable members to involve\nthemselves in implementing some of tn eir ideas both to demonstrate their own convictions and to bring these\nideas to the attention of\nothers. Tnese activities\nhave been numerous and widespread, but the\nion ge st standing has\nbeen the \" Computer Paper Re-cycling Campaign\". The waste of\ntons of computer printout has struck many\nactivist groups in other\ncolleges as worthy of\n. en. on, but no other\ncollege can claim, as far\na e know, anything ap-.roa c ning the success\nachieved by IC Eco. ct.on.\nThe campaign, launched in January 1 9 7 2 after\nTaking the T out of re'f 'use\nleg: Administration\nHeads of Departments,\netc., was based on the\nprovision of boxes in all departments into which anyone could discard\nunwanted print-out and cards. These boxes were\nemptied periodically and the paper stored in a small room kindly provided for the purpose by\nthe Domestic Bursar.\nWhen a suitable quantity (about 1 to 2 tons)\nhad been thus ac cum u dated, it was removed\nby a charity \u2014 Rereach into Child Blind ness \u2014 which specialises in fund-raising by\nselling computer waste\nfor re-cycling. During nearly two years of op e ration, the group collected about 3 5 tons of\npaper in the following\ncategories:\ncomputer print-out\n.25}- tons wc th approx.\n\u00a3510\ncomputer cards\n7 tons wort l'i approx.\n\u00a3210\nPhone books, journals,\netc.\n2\\ tons worth approx.\n\u00a320.\nNote that these prices\nare roughly those paid\nby paper dealers if they\ncollect from source; if\nthe paper is delivered to\nthe dealers, the prices\nare significantly higher.\nThere is also a related\nsaving to the community as the London rate-payer\nhas to pay \u00a36 to \u00a310 for\nthe collection and disposal of every ton of re-fuse.\nThe long-term aim of\nthe campaign was to\ndemonstrate to the College authorities the financial viability of the\nscheme and to this end a detailed report was submitted to trie Rector,\nthe Secretary and the Financial Secretary in May1972. This report, noting that College employees have already\nto move refuse from\nsource to collection\npo.nt showed than an annual income of up to\n\u00a32,000 could be generated with a minimum of\nsegregation. Talks continued for well over a year until finally, last\nmonth, ' the College\nagreed to take over the\nwhole scheme (cutting\nout RIC B, of course). To give them a start, the\ngroup presented the College with 3 tons of computer waste which was recently sold for over\n\u00a370.\nThe full implementation of the scheme is dependent on Westminster\nCouncil's installation of\na general waste compressor \u2014 a Dumpster\nin Me ch. Eng., similar to\nthat at present operating\nin South Side. Once this is done, the small brick building in the\nEast Court can be used\nas a paper store. There\nmay also be problems\nwith N UP E to be ironed\nout. In the meantime,\nanyone with a large\nquantity of easily\nhandled paper waste\nshould inform Mr. Bracking of Supplies \u2014 Int.\n3 2 0 6 .\nMARK BALDWIN on behalf of IC\nEco-Action\nDigby the biggest dog\nin the world\nFILM\nOne of this year's Christmas presents to child ren from Odeons throughout the country will be\nDigby the Biggest Dog in the World\"( Cert. U) The film stars \" Du lux\" as Digby, Jim Dale as Jeff\nEldon, Spike Milligan as the German Dr. Harz,\nAngela Douglas as an attractive widow, Janine, Richard Beaumont as her son Billy, Milo O' She a and Dinsdale Landen.\nJeff is employed as an animal psychologist at\nsecret research centre, which is working on project ' X' \u2014 a new drug that can grow twenty\nfive feet long cucumbers. Jeff steals some of the\nnew chemical and takes it home to give to his roses, hoping they will win him a prize at the\nChelsea Flower Show. There he discovers Digby given to him by Billy as his grandfather would not allow him to keep it. J a dine arrives and gives\nDigby the secret drug, believing it to be milk.\nBilly comes back the next day to collect Digby\nas his grandfather has changed his mind. Digby has already started to grow and so Jeff tells him he\nhas given the dog away and is then made to eat\nthe tin of PAL in his hand claiming it to be his\ndinner. Dr. Harz observes this and is now convinced that Jeff thinks he is a dog. As Digby grows, Jeff decides to take him to his Aunt Ina in the country and dresses him as a horse. Two crooks, Tom and Jerry (Norman Ros ngt on and John Bluthal), who have accidentally\nstumbled across Digby now steal him while Jeff\nis having a meal in a transport cafe (a very funny\nscene) and sell him to a circus. Digby is seen on the television, and Jeff and Billy set out to rescue\nhim at the circus. The Ringmaster is not too happy\nabout Digby, now fifty feet tall (\"If he lifts his\nleg, he'll drown fifty kids\"). Digby breaks out of\nhis chains, pulls the big top down as people flee\nand starts rampaging through the countryside ter\nro rising all. No one can cope with him now, he' s bigger\nthan King Kong, a National Emergency faces the\ncountry, a Cabinet meeting is held and it is dec i ded that the only answer is to bomb Digby. With Digby trapped in a ravine the bombers move in. The film is directed by Joseph McGrath and produced by Walter S henson. I felt that the spec i a\" effects were quite well done and the film is full\nof laughs. If you are taking young children, par\nti cula rly very young children to the cinema thi; Christmas, or recommending a film, or if you would like to see a film without sex and violence\nthen Digby is an ideal film. The film is now showing at Studio One, Oxford Circus, and will be on general release in time\nfor Christmas.\nHARRY HILL\nThe exploits of the\nIncomparable\nMwlla Nasrndin\nby Idries Shah\nPicador 40p BOOK\nOne of the basic tenets of the Muslim religion\nis that there is no absolute reality but God, but\nthe only doctrine to take this to its logical con clu sion is Sufism. In his book, \"The Sufis\", Idries\nShah has introduced the Dervishes and their philo-soph y: the central figure in a series of medieval\njokes used to illustrate the teachings of Sufism was MullaN as rud in. In this series of tales, Nasr udin takes the part\nof teacher, fool, beggar or physician, yet always\nmanages to exhibit the aerobatic contortions to\nwhich the human mind is prone. On this level,\nthen, this is a serious book, but on another plane\nit is also wholly and hilariously funny. Here is\nthe home ground of the Goons and Monty Python,\nand the origin of many chestnuts of the Music Hall:\" Nasr udin s' wife ran to his room when she heard a tremendous thump.\nNothing to worry about,' said the Mull a, 'it was only my cloak which fell to the ground'.\n'What, and made a noise like that?'

Most of the tales are\nlonger than these, but\nthe mind bog gI ing punchlines are a feature\nof them all. Maybe it is\npure madness, but it is a peculiar brand which has survived for nearly a thousand years, and it\ncovers a deep wisdom and understanding. After\nall, would it still be so\nfunny if it didn't?A must for anyone\npretending to a sense of\nhumour, but also a book\nfor thinking over. Definitely recommended.\nCAN DI.P.S. The \" book\" rev ie wed two weeks ag \u00ab\nwas \" Fade out\" by J. Hansen (Quartet 40p). Devalued Degrees?\nWe cannot be expected to hope for much out of\nour degrees when:1. \u2014 Size of technological and scientific projects\nare constantly increasing, thus also increasing their\ndependence on economical and political decisions,\ntrade unions' decisions, supply or availability of\nland and resources, pressure groups' claims, international relations, etc. and, while none of these\nfactors look very promising, all of them are beyond\nthe control of the scientist or engineer.\n2.\u2014 Jobs, salaries and compensations depend\never more on supply and demand, experience, bargaining power (unions, national policies, etc.),\nmeeting the employers' demands (rather than the\ncollege's); and less on degrees, qualifications, col-leg e's prestige, etc.\n3.\u2014 People increasingly lose their confidence in\" experts\"( i.e., we), political parties, very large projects (from large buildings and roads to Map lins and Concordes), sophisticated technology (e.g., nuclear power, etc.).\n4.\u2014 Prices of fuel, land and resources in general\nare soaring up, plus \" occasional\" rationing s, plus\nconstantly decreasing expectations in fuel reserves,\nplus more and more dependence on foreign co un tries' supplies and demands, plus increased dependence on supra national corporations, plus\n\" occasional\" strikes; which means less chances for\nour large scale, highly sophisticated, highly organised and costly (in resources and money) science\nand technology.\n5.\u2014 Ever larger scale, centralised and more complicated technology produces ever more pollution\n(directly or indirectly); depletion of resources;\ndrastic environmental changes; obsolescence of\nobjects, techniques and trained or skilled people;\nmisunderstandings, suspicion, mistrust and blind\ndependence from the majority of people; larger\nscale u predicted side effects, etc.\nWhy, then, is it not possible to dedicate some of\nthe time of our curricula (preferably the time taken\nby exams!) to the justification, purpose and future\nof our careers? On what grounds are we expected\nto accept the present ways of \" education\"? \u2014 ' does our opinion count at all? Or does it only count\nWhen we say something \" academic\"? Or are we expected to learn What is given to us without questioning and yet believe that we are not being somehow indoctrinated?\nNo doubt the quality of science is declining; no\ndoubt there is disenchantment with technology;\nhow can we be expected to be proud of a Ph.D., if\nwe don't know what Philosophy or real thinking\nmeans? If we don't know Why or for What we are\nlearning? Are we expected to believe (like many\npeople do!) that geniuses can be produced like boxes of tissues?\nWhatever the reasons for this state of things\n(tradition, the world, the government, capitalism,\netc.) it is necessary that we all look into all these\nquestions as well as into what kind of education?\nFor whom? When? How? By Whom? After all, what\nis education? If we can't answer this one clearly,\nWhy bother with exams?\nMerry Exams and Happy New Term.\nJ. Aguirre, Civ. Eng. 3 1 0 .\nConcert\nReview:\nLindisfarne\nWhat a way to end up this term's series of concerts. It was certainly the one I enjoyed the most.\nBeforehand I was unsure what to expect, having\nheard so little of Lindisfarne since the departure\nof Alan Hull, who was a very important member,\nbut they haven't changed much. They're still the\nsame manly Geordies that I remember from way\nback, with their famous Newky, which they even\nsang a song about. Indeed, if it wasn't for Lindisfarne, Newcastle Brown might never have reached\nas far south as London.\nAs for their, music, it is such that it has an instantaneous and lasting impact. Their songs can be just as enjoyable on the first hearing as they\nare on the hundredth. The thing about Lindisfarne\nis the extra something they put into the atmosphere, inducing audience participation with incalculable ease. Even people like me, who belong, I suppose, to the so-called \" s it down and be cool\" class, feel tempted to clap their hands in the air.\nThey did several of their newer compositions,\nwithout forgetting the old favourites. They were all there: \" No Time to Lose\", the ghost-song \" Lady Elan our\",( nicely changed from the original three-year old version too), and \" Fog on the Tyne\", the naughty verse of which they dedicated, \" Since we're in London\", to Mark and Anne, and let the\naudience sing it several times. They finished their\nscheduled set with\" We Can Swing Together\", a song with an interesting history, in which Ray\nJackson still does his medley on harmonica,> \u00a7\nmuch neglected instrument nowadays, lasting quite\nsome time and Without being boring. No mean\nfeat of endurance, when you can do that and still\nhave enough breath left to sing the final verse as\nwell.\nFor the encore they did yet another one from the\n\" Nicely Out of Tune\" album, \" Clear White Light\", and finally \" When the War is Over\", a song with a lengthy very nice piano-vocal introduction.\nIt was quite a pleasant surprise to me to find\nthat Claire Hamm il was doing the support act, as\nI think she's got a lovely voice, and despite her\nrecent attack of laryngitis (well that's what she\nsaid), she sang some nice gentle songs, though 1\nthought she fairly crucified the Walker Brothers\"\n\" You' ve Lost that Loving Feeling\".

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX December 11th,1973 UGM-HORROR SHOCK EXPOSE\nA shock tactic was unveiled again\nat the U GM last Thursday when a \"Jesus-freak\" evangelist challenged\nthe quorum during the grants debate.\nClaiming to be speaking against\nthe substantive motion .which would have mandated Exec to publicise and hold meetings about the Grants Campaign next term, Mr. J. Christ knows what (31) of 12 Angel Mews, Cloud cuckoo land, W10, threatened\nto challenge the quorum at the end of his speech.\nThis tactic, which has remained in\ncold storage since last term, has now been repainted blue and equipped\nwith a shining new halo ( 2 5 p available from Evangelical Accessories Ltd., Mile End 'Road, haloes, sepulchre s, jackboots and other Nazi relics,\ncallers welcome). Calling himself\" the voice of the silent majority\", Mr. Christwbatabore\nhad calculated the meeting to be in quo rate and therefore not representative of IC students.\n\" This in no way invalidates our firm belief that any decision passed\nat aUG M quo rate or not, is unrepresentative unless voted for by over\nhalf the registered students\", he continued.\nHe added:\" in the unlikely event\nof such a thing happening, we would of course consider it unrepresentative of the mass of the student body in this country, etc., etc.\".\nTHUNDERBOLTS Despite Mr. Christ knows my mother and be knows her bloody well's Challenge, Norm Sayles rallied valiantly\nfor about 3 0 seconds, claiming that\na challenge to the quorum does not\nconstitute a speech against, the sud den crash of thunderbolts and the mysterious appearance of a flaming\nbush on the stage whispering in a deep voice, \" quorum, already\" made\nhim accept the challenge and declare\nthe meeting Closed.\n'However, before Mr. Christ's peculiarly timed challenge ( Mr. Christ is a director of \" No nail Crucifixes\" Ltd., Kidderminster) a motion, horribly unrepresentative of the vast\nmass of sensible students, had declared IC's condemnation of the\nmilitary coup in Chile and given an enormous sum of money (believed to\nbe about 0 . 3 per cent of the Union's funds) to a committee for rescuing\nultra-marxist refugees and peasants\nfrom the junta's justified and proper\ntorture, random execution and pau-per is ation programme.\nAn attempt to amend the motion\nwas made by Pete Lambert who claimed that the policies of Allende,\nwhich had led to the coup, were identical to those of the Communist Party in this country and that a condemnation of the idealist nature of\nthe so-called \" peaceful road to\nsocialism\" was needed.\nSOLIDARITY\nThis was spoken against by aMr. John Lane of the CP GB( S), one time\npresident of ICU, Who claimed that\nthe vast majority of Students were\nnot 'interested in the testing of the\nvarious theoretical roads to a solution\nof students' problems in practice.\nHe claimed\" solidarity\" was what was needed now and offered to start\nan \" Ad hoc committee for the laying\nof wreaths on the tombs of dead\nStalinist s\". This was amended by Mr. Jock Veall (squatter, of no fixed abode)\nwho suggested the convening of a\" Popular Front against popular fronti sm\" and offered to send out invitations to H. Wilson, Len Murray, John Gollan, T. Cliff, Gery Lawless of\nMI5, the Archbishop of Canterbury\nand any other parties interested in\nthe selling out of the working class.\nTEACUPS There was much discussion on the\nmeaning of the word solidarity, but Piers Corby n( Red Weakly seller of28 Jay Mews and revolutionary dilettante) ex pained\" solidarity with the miners\" as meaning giving them cups\nof tea and holding hands on picket\nlines, however\" solidarity with the Chilean working class\" clearly requires a different strategy, due to the\ntea getting cold after being sent\n8 , 0 0 0 miles, namely the sending of\nmessages of support and the donation\nof money, both to be intercepted by the military junta \u2014 but it's the\nthought that counts!\nThe idea of solidarity meaning\nunity in action, with all sections of\nthe working class brought into conflict with this Government over the questions of inflation and the defence\nof democratic rights, to remove the\nTories, was dismissed by these so called revolutionaries as \" correct\" and \" the only way forward\" and therefore to be fought against, in the\ninterests of the bourgeoisie.\nNO JOKE However this is no laughing matter,\nfor as the capitalist system enters a worldwide period of recession as it\nis today, high ten ed by the \"oil crisis\"\nthe building of a revolutionary party\nbased on a firm bedrock of marxist\nprinciples becomes the paramount\nquestion for students, trade unionists\nand professional workers everywhere.\nWhitelaw has been brought back\nfrom Ireland to spearhead a series of\nTory attacks and provocations on the\nworking class.\nHe has been well trained in all the\nskills of military rule, not least of\nwhich has been the experience of\ndealing with the reformist SDLP\nleaders in Ulster.\nNATIONALIST\nHe will cajole and threaten the\nlabour leaders in this country into\nselling out every struggle of the working class in the coming period.\nShaping up very fast at the moment is the likelihood of a \"nationalist\"\ncoalition government composed of\nthe Tory party. Prentice, Jenkins.\nShirley Williams and other Labour\nParty right-wingers.\nA \"red scare\" will be made with\nwhich to frighten the confused middle\nclass into permitting the full scale\nuse of police and army suppression\nof the working class.\nAs this crisis deepens daily that is\nthe vista which is opening up befor\u00bb\nour eyes.\nA vista of unemployment, poverty,\npolice and army brutality that, as one\nWall Street financier put it, \"wi H make the 30's seem like a summer\nholiday\".\nUnless, that is, the working class\ntakes the power and establishes soci-al ism,a planned economy, and the\nsystematic removal of poverty which\nis concomitant with such an increase\nin the productive forces.\nChile isn't just a small \"banana\nrepublic\" thousands of miles away,\nChile is capitalism, Chile is inflation,\nChile is here in this country. It's no\ncoincidence that the Telegraph talks\nabout a \"Chilean solution may have tm\nbe found if the miners don't back\ndown\", when we have all the economic problems here fast approaching\nChilean standards that produced\nAllende, that produced the junta and\nwill be our future unless we build the\nWorkers Revolutionary Party and the\nYoung Socialist Student Society right\naway. Editor.\nAPOLOGY\nThe Editor wishes to apologise for having suggested in last Thursday's U GM that three of the military leaders \u2014 President Allende of Chile, invited into his cabinet shortly before the coup\nlater emerged as leaders of the military junta\nwhich overthrew him. In fact it was( only) two. But somehow I feel\nthat to make such a correction, in the interests of\nhistorical veracity, was not the motives behind\nthe o all s of \" liar! rubbish!\" that sprang from\nthe lips of arch-Stalinists John Lane and Renato\nEzban on hearing the aforementioned inaccuracy.\nChristian-Marxists\nFOLK CLUB\nCEILIDH\nIWith Bob Davenport\njand Rakes\n{Wednesday, Dec. 12th17.30 p.m. Concert Hall\n1\nI pill ll lM III III III III III III III HII III IN IIII III INc/ Avid followers of the thrill-packed Felix theological debate must find\nit hard to believe that (in\nrecent years) the main trend in the relations be tween Marxists and Christians has been tow ard s dialogue.\n'Since Karl Marx' s famous \" opium of the people\" phrase has been\nmentioned let us examine it in context.\n\" Religious suffering is\nthe expression of real\nsuffering and at the\nsame time the protest\nagainst real suffering.\nReligion is the sigh of\nthe oppressed creature,\nthe heart of a heartless\nworld, as it is the spirit\nof spiritless conditions.\nIt is the opium of the people\". Even this is only part\nof the picture. Angela\nDavis has pointed out that while Christianity\nwas used to justify slavery in the Southern\nStates, to slave as well as master, it also inspired the revolt of the slaves. A similar dichotomy has appeared in countless peasant revolts\nin Europe. And today,\nthe most respected\nChristians are surely\nthose such as theSpa nish worker-priests or the Latin American priest\nand guerilla leader, Torres, who have sacrificed\ntheir freedom, comfort,\nand even lives to fight\noppression. Throughout\nits history \" Christianity\" has contained two re li gions. One, usually the\ndominant, has justified\noppression and encouraged passivity, acceptance of one's place, do gooding. The other has inspired revolt. An attack on all Christians is, therefore, not very\nsmart.\nUnfortunately the most vociferous spokesmen for Christianity in IC belong to a third\ntrend, the evangelists.\nAlthough hostile to the\nestablished Church, they\nare if anything more re-action ary. The evangelist believes he has found\nGod, that this makes\nhim a better person, and that his life should be spent telling people how to \" turn on to Jesus\". Eventually, when everyone has been converted\nwe will all be\" good\" and then, and only then,\ncan the world's problems be solved. Mean while such irritations as\nmass starvation, fascist\nstates and exploitation\nare of minor importance\ncompared to the burning\nissue of making the next\nconvert. I believe this\nattitude is arrogant, ego-ti st ical, anti-human and selfish, in fact, surely,\na nti-Christian?\nThe question remains:\nis Marxist humanism a better basis for human advance than even the most progressive Christianity?\nThat can only really\nbe proved in practice, as\nthose many Christians who go beyond charitable \" first aid\" work in\nsociety and try to fight\nthe root cause of poverty\nand injustice, have real-is ed. In conclusion, the\nin com pre hen 'ding theological battle in Felix is\na waste of time. But if there are Christians in\nIC who feel that a genuine Communis'tj Christian dialogue would be\nworthwhile, it's easy to\ncontact me, John Lane.\nPublic debate\nchallenge\nSir,\nI, too, am fed up with this \" religion\" controversy which has filled\nspace in your paper over\nthe past few weeks; and to end it I challenge Mr. Veall to state his views at a public debate on the\nmatter. Iam prepared to organise and publicise\nsuch an event, at which a fair indication of the interest of students will be gained from the num ber who attend. Having\nmade these contentious\nclaims, Mr. Ve all should either defend them in public or stop writing these articles, as he is only hiding behind the\nim personality of the press. In any case, Felix\nreaders will have a rest.\nIf Mr. Veall is good enough to contact me we can discuss arrange-ment s.A.N. Syrop.\nJEWSOC\nTUESDAY, ll th DECEMBER 1973\nROOM 408, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING\nat 1 p.m. there will be a meeting with the Information Counsellor and a talk about \"Middle East \u2014 where next?\"\n\n"

ISSUE No. 350\nGUILDS UGM\nM.E.2201.15 pm Tues\nHave a Happy Xmas\nEveryone!\nGRANT INCREASE IMMINENT An increase in grants is about to\nbe recommended in a confidential\nGovernment report to be drafted\nsoon.\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph\nthis increase \" will not, in present\neconomic circumstances, approach\nthe 3 5 per cent increase demanded at the recent NUS conference in Margate\". The level of the residual income\n(at present \u00a31400) may be raised to\n\u00a31800 or higher. This is the assess-able income left after mortgages,\nsuper an nu ation, etc.\nNothing will be done about discretionary awards, or the means test,\nand the Government seems constant\nabout what to do with married w om en's grants and PG awards.\nSir Brian is thought to have said\nthat the increase about to be offered\nis about \u00a3100.\nSuch an increase will in no way bring us up to the halcyon days of\nthe 1 9 6 2 level and coupled with inflation of 4 0 per cent pa expected by\nChristmas, according to the Guardian, this means that the \u00a3100 could be\nwiped out over the Christmas vaca-tion.\nStudents next term cannot afford\nto be complacent about the political\nand economic crisis, they will either\nbe starved out of higher education by\nrising prices or the grants campaign\nis fought on a higher level: that of\nan alliance with sections of the Trade\nUnion movement to bring down the\nTories.\nThe DES has refused to let students keep their living standards and has launched attacks through the\nC VEP to victim is e students who take\naction (rent strikes, etc.).\nThe rent strikes of IC next term has to be fought in conjunction with all sections of students and trade unionists to bring down the Tories and their blatant contempt for students.\nPURPLE PATCH\nAs this is the last patch of the\nterm, and many of you Will shortly\nbe going home, or at least away from\nCollege, I would like you to think\nabout a few topics other than those\nwhich directly affect your student\nlives.\nWhen those of you who are lucky\nenough to be going home to see your\nparents and families, arrive there and get settled in beside the nice warm fire, with Mum fussing over you, and Dad offering to take you out for a pint, please spare a thought for those\nwho cannot get home this Christmas. Think for a few moments of the foreign students from the College( al-most1000) who are having to spend\ntheir vacation in some cold and dingy\nbeds it in Neas den, dreaming of the\nChrist masses in the past which they\nhave spent at home with their parents\nand families. Iam sure that none of\nyou would argue with the fact that\nthe prospect of spending Christmas\nalone in London in your little beds it thinking of all the people who have\ngone home to their families, is not a very warming idea. I would also like to think of your\nown position this Christmas. Think of how lucky you are to be at home,\nand how nice it is for a change to\nbe getting good meals and also a good bed to sleep in. Think about\nyour \" Miserable\" grant and how you can only afford \" One square meal each day of the week\". Then try to\nimagine yourself in the position of\nsomeone in a back wood town in Vietn am or the war ridden areas of Greece\nor Chile. Imagine yourself as an18 year old black boy in the middle of\nRhodesia. What would you feel like if you could only get one square meal\neach month, or had been kicked out of University for admitting that your\nlecturer was prejudiced against you for the colour of your skin? I 'll tell\nyou what you would feel like, you would probably feel very sick, and would be JUSTIFIED in thinking that\nsociety was working against you. You would find it difficult to believe that\nthe students in the Western world were protesting at only getting \u00a315\neach week to live on, and not being\nable to live a life of luxury.\nThis Christmas whilst you are at\nhome, please spend a little time\nthinking about those around the world who have far les privileges than you, and yet who are biologically exactly\nthe same as you. Think about those\npeople in Northern Ireland Who are\nafraid to go out after 8.0 in the evening because of a fear of being involved in a terrorist gun battle.\nAs a final thought, if you do not\nknow very much or do not believe\nwhat you have heard about this man Jesus Christ, then please spend a little time over the vacation trying to\nsort out What it is all about.\nFor those overseas students who will be staying in London over the\nChristmas vacation, I would give you one tip, that in many of the Churches\naround the area you will be able to\nfind friends who will be only too\nhappy to share their Christmas enjoyment with you. If you live in the area\naround College you will find that\nSaint Paul's Church, Onslow Square,\nhas a very large number of students\nand overseas visitors in the congregation who would be only too happy\nto help you have an enjoyable Christmas.\nTo each and every one of you, I wish you a very merry Christmas and hope that those Christians amongst\nyou will pray for those in the rest of\nthe world less fortunate than us, and that those non-Christians amongst\nyou Will give a little time to think\nabout those in the rest of the world less fortunate than us. See you ail after Christmas. Norm. P.A.W. N.O. At 6.00 p.m. on Friday evening I did a tour of the halls of residence\nto collect the nomination forms for\nthe Imperial College Tenants Association Executive Committee. I found\ncompleted forms only in Beit and Selkirk. Now, at 4 . 0 0 on Sunday the\nsituation is the same. I can announce\nthat Mess rs. Tony Taylor and Digby\nJames are the elected representatives for Beit Hall and Mr s.Ave ril De wing is the Representative for Selkirk Hall. As yet, the constitution that\nI 've prepared has yet to be formally\napproved. Because of this I may find\nit necessary to alter it slightly to en able the Executive Committee to be\nformed. I hope I don't have to do this\nbut it will all depend on the response\nto the nomination papers during the\nrest of the week.\nDuring the last term it has been\nmy task (an almost thankless one)\nto advertise the Union General meet-in gs. At most of these (and there\nhave been six) there has been some\ndiscussion on the rent strike and the\ngrants campaign. However, except\nfor the initial decision to have a rent\nstrike, very few other agreement have\nbeen reached. Why? Mainly because\nof the lack of people present at the\nmeetings, which have therefore been\ndeemed in quo rate. The quorum is at\npresent 3 0 0 out of a total of 4 , 0 8 6\nstudents; a pathetically small percentage. Yet the total turn-out at the\nC CU meetings has been collectively\nmore than the IC U GM quorum. If you consider that your C CU business (and this is NOT a kick at\nthe CC U's) is more important than\nthe amount of money that you have\nin your pockets then that is your\nbusiness. However, it is no use blaming the ICU Exec for not trying to\nget the grants raised if you, the student body, are not prepared to do something about it also. There are\ntoo many people at this college who jump at the chance to criticise, to talk,\nto argue, but there are very few who are willing to act. It is not criticism, talking, and arguments that get what\nwe want. What is needed is action.\nMass action that involves as many\nstudents as possible. The rent strike\nis one of these, but not the only one.\nThis not only needs people participating, it also means that some of\nthe people that do all the talking\nmust be wiling to help out with the\norganisation, the leafletting, the pub-li c ising, the production of posters,\netc., etc. If it takes one person 4\nhours minimum to put up posters in\nall a vall a bile places, then it takes less\nthan half-an-hour for a dozen people\nto do the same. Next term's rent\nstrike is going ahead and if you want\nit to work, if you really believe that\nwe need higher grants (and you must\nbe nuts if you think the present grants\nsystem is satisfactory) then you must\nbe willing to work for it; you must be\nwilling to act.\nThe first meeting of the Imperial\nCollege Tenants Association will be\nheld this week .At present the venue\nisn't finalised (it will,I hope, be the\nUnion Concert Hall or Me ch.Eng.220) but every resident will be getting a note to let him or her know where it will be. Please try and come.\nThe time will be Thursday at 5.45\nwhich I hope will not clash with any-thing. Please try and show that the\nperson putting up the notices about\napathy society is wrong about this\ncollege.\nDuplicating Machines. So much for one of my rare political pieces,\nnow for something a bit lighter.\nThose of you who have had cause to\nuse the duplicating machines during\nthe last term may have noticed that\nthey are sadly lacking in various odd items, e.g. ink drums, fuses and others. A Roneo rep finally, after more\nphone calls than I care to mention,\ndecided that he would come and have a look. He gave them a thorough\ninspection and then an estimate for\nthe cost of putting them back into\nalmost new condition. Needless to\nsay, it, is only slightly more expensive to buy new ones. It is hoped,\ntherefore, that by the end of the\nChristmas vacation we will have two\nnew machines plus one of the old machines for less important work.\nThe two new ones will be locked away in the duplicating room and will be for limited personnel only. It\nwill be necessary to insist that ail people who wish to use the new machines will have to attend a demonstration given by someone from\nRoneo. Adequate warning will be given beforehand.\nChristmas is upon us, under us, around us. Soon, most of you will be\nwinging your way home (assuming\nyou can get petrol for your vehicle,\nthat the airlines get fuel for their\nplanes, that the train drivers don't go\non strike and that there is enough\nelectricity to light your way home). Once there you can s it down to turkey ( 5 0 pa lb., don't eat too much)\nand all the trimmings( probably 50\nper cent more expensive than last\nyear). You can drink yourself merry( at least 3 p more than at college for\neach drink). Warm yourself in front\nof the fire (I hope you've got enough\ncd al.O h!and while I remember \u2014 ;\nMERRY CHRISTMAS. Successful nomination for Tir and Hall: D.R. Gray, Andy Hig man. P.A.

Jorvis Thribb (17).\nAdventures in the\nUnion Quadrangle:\nOn Saturday, December the first, an amazing and unprecedented event took place in the\nUnion Quadrangle. At about ten to midnight,\nsome people with left-wing views on free speech\nattacked people taking part in a sing-song.\nThis came to happen in the following way:\nthere was a meeting of left-orientated people in\nthe Union Lower Refectory on Saturday afternoon\nand evening, and many of those present stayed\nafterwards for a drink in the Lower Lounge. Kno wing Soc. Sac's views, people in the bar decided to have a bit of fun by holding the Saturday night\nsing-song in the Lower Lounge. This was a success, perhaps due to the better acoustics of the\nlounge, and a good time was had by all, until at\neleven o 'clock they retired to the bar for a final\npinta. The sing-song continued there, until they\nwere chucked out, when it moved to the Quad. Various songs were sung, and finally they sang\nthe bar version of 'The Red Flag'. At this, members of Soc.S oc, who felt that a song which had great significance to them was being mocked, emerged from the Lounge equipped\nwith bottles, and attacked some of the singers.\nSeeing that an unequal fight, w th only, one possible\noutcome, was on the cards, some members of the\nRugby Club attempted to restore order by pulling\napart those who were fighting. To do so, they\nhad to hold one of their members, well known for his ability in a fight, to the floor. At this the.\nperson with whom he had been fighting kicked him in the face.\nThis made the singers realise that Soc.S oc. really wanted a fight, so they rapidly took them\napart, and drove them out of the Quad. You may be pleased to hear that the person kicked in the\nface is all right, apart from, a broken tooth, and that the kicker received his just reward.\nJEM IM A PUDDLE DUCK How would your club/organisation like to be\nin a position to earn a great deal of money?

One\nof those events which you see posters for, but still\nhaven't any idea what it's all about. Maybe this\narticle will help clarify things.\nTouchstone is, basically, a discussion weekend,\nthough it has many other good points besides\nthat. It starts off, soon after you arrive with a talk given by the guest speaker, who is usually\nof high renown in his subject. This lasts roughly\nan hour, and is followed by an open forum in\nwhich you can fire questions at him on any queries\narising.\nAfter dinner groups of half a dozen or more\nare formed; and once a chairman and scribe is\nelected you can discuss-cum-argue over some set\nquestions either until you've said your lot, you're\nblue in the face, or bed, bar or snooker takes its\ntoll.\nNext morning, after breakfast you can do as\nyou please (except stay in bed), though person-ally, nothing short of a monsoon would keep\nme from a walk in nearby Windsor Great Park,\nwhich is beautiful at all times of year. If you go\nin winter though, beware of Virginia Water, as\nthe ice may not be as sturdy as it seems. Indeed\nit claimed two of our party (me included) When\nwe tried to make our way across one of the\nnarrower parts. Also to enable you to return in\ntime for lunch maps are issued, and are quite\nuseful.\nTo round off with, everyone congregates in the\nafternoon' and results of the previous night's discussion are compared (hence the necessity of\nseri be s), with the speaker giving his point of view,\nhe having; the advantage of knowing the questions\nby the weekend. People who have already been to a Touchstone\nweekend may have noticed that I have so far\navoided the subject of food. This is by no means\nbecause it is below par. Quite the contrary in fact.\nIt cannot fail to satisfy, gourmets and gannets\nalike, and even the water tastes nicer over there,\nfrom the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds, and the topic under examination\nwas\" The Place of Cars to Society\". Peter Hills was very involved in the Buchanan Report and this didi, inevitably, enter his talk. Basically it con cern's, the problem of traffic in urban districts, and various methods concerning this problem were discussed. One of the most interesting ideas, I thought, was the inclusion of a black box in every\ncar, and theoretically technology would enable\nthis, device to register at a faster rate in city\ncentres than in the country. With road tax based\non this, it would hopefully, act as a restraint on\ncar usage both because it would cost more to\ntravel in city centres and also the driver would be constantly reminded of how much he is spend-ing.\nThe first two of the questions involved the personal freedom of the individual to purchase and\noperate his own car, and to What extent should\nlaws protect third parties, passengers, and drivers\nthemselves. It it was generally agreed that individuals should not be prevented from buying cars,\nthough restraints should be laid down when the\nsafety or rights of others is concerned, i.e. protect the innocent from the foolhardy, but not the\nfoolhardy from themselves, as it is comparable\nto things like ski-ing and mountain-climbing. Thus\nseat belts should not be enforced though prevention of drunken driving and speeding should. For the third question it was decided that the\ntax distribution for different modes of transport\nwas not equitable or truly reflective of social costs that each impose on the community, and\npublic transport should be competitive with private transport with the intention of reducing traffic congestion. This led to number four: that the\nvalues associated with city centres should be\nconserved even if it restrains private car usage,\nin those centres.\nThe last two questions were both technological,\nconcerning a replacement for the automobile, and the threat of the continued exploitation of crude\noil' to the natural ecosystem, though nobody\nseemed really qualified to answer these with much accuracy.\nG.

Paragraph one on the Camino Real review \u2014\nlights down, enter Don Quixote and Sancho Panza\nfrom the back of the hall. We notice the stage has a large extension, black cloth covers the raised\nportions and the characters enter and exit via\nthese cio th s. Obviously this is to be no ordinary\nplay, the audience is here to get involved, not\nmerely spec tate. Don Quixote enters the Camino Real, his companion Sancho runs back to La\nMancha, Quixote sleeps . . . .\nParagraph two on the Camino Real review \u2014\nan ageing gentleman in white suit and pink bow tie, aMr. Gutman, announces Black1 on the\nCamino Real, he is to be our narrator, an overseer,\nsomeone of some importance. But let us consider\nthe action, the plot? A survivor crawls from the\ndesert on to the plaza, he turns towards the Siete\nMares, despite advice to the contrary. A loud\nshot rings out and the desperate man falls to the\nground, crawling over the dried-up fountain.\nJacques Casanova is appalled by these events,\nthere is nothing he can do. Gutman is now on the phone to his superior, describing the scene,\na blind girl and a guitar-toting dreamer assist the\nsurvivor, but not for long. \" The survivor is no\nlonger surviving\". Paragraph three on the Camino Real review \u2014\n' Kii roy is coming\", written in chalk on the wall, enter an ex-boxer born and bred in Texas, Yes sir,\n\" Kii roy is here\". His heart, the size of a baby's head, has grown weak and a pair of golden boxing\ngloves draped round his neck remain as a reminder\nof his glorious past. His wallet is stolen by street\nvagrants. In typical American style he stands his\nground, confronts Mr. Gutman, who offers him a job as a\" Patsy\" \u2014 a clown. Kiiroy tries to escape\nhis fate, he is caught and forced to wear the\nclown's mask, the flashing nose.\nParagraph four on the Camino Real review \u2014\nremember the survivor, he is carried off in a dust-bin by \" The Streetcleaners\", the same fate befalls\nthe Baron de Char lus upon his demise, is there any escape from this . . . . this place? Oh yes, across\nthe desert, the nothing, nothing and more nothing,\nto the snow-covered mountains on the horizon.\nKiiroy is clown, end of Black6, interval.\nParagraph five on the Camino Real review \u2014\n\"It's not so much a play as a state of mind\" \u2014\nIt's very impressive, isn't it\" \u2014 Look, darling, it\nsays in the programme that everyone reaches the\nCamino Real at some stage in their life, we leave\nthe illusions of youth behind and each has to face\nthe Terra Incognita (the desert) of age in your own way\" \u2014 \"I don't get it\" \u2014 \" What' s it all about?\" \u2014 \" What does it mean?\" \u2014 MEAN? MEAN? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? The fools, do they think\nthey've come to see \" Coronation Street\"? Paragraph six on the Camino Real review \u2014 The great lover, Jacques Casanova, is talking with the\nfair Marguerite, she still dwells on the anguish\nof the coming of her menopause, \" it's always a white flower now, never a pink\". Casanova's thoughts are on love and resting on the Camino Real, Marguerite's are on escape. Suddenly, there\nin the sky, that noise, getting louder, it's the un scheduled flight, the Fugitivo! Chaos, people run-ning, shouting, cases, tickets, money, papers, Customs, \" quick Jacques, get my money, my clothes,\nmy papers \u2014 let me get out \u2014 the FU G IT IVO!\" \u2014\nhurry, more chaos, noise, people running, Lord\nMulligan carted off by the street cleaners, more\npeople running, the noise, the lights, the Fugitivo\nleaves. Marguerite is left on the steps stranded,\n\u00abin tears, trapped. She no longer wants Jacques\nCasanova, she leaves him. Paragraph seven on the Camino Real review \u2014\nLord Byron leaves the Siete Mares to return to his ene main devotion in life . . . . to . . . .? What is\nhis one main devotion? Byron explains how his\nheart is in the only instrument he should listen to.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by F. Bailey and Son Ltd., Dursley, G los. GL114 BL. not rows of paid musicians; in the background the\ndreamer quietly plays, Byron walks up the staircase\nto the Terra Incognita, \" someone stop him, warn him of the desert\", Byron is undaunted, he knows\nwhat he is doing, he walks out of Camino Real\nand is gone. What of those that remain, they have\nall paid the price of admission \u2014 DESPERATION. Those with cash in the Siete Mares, those without\neither in the \" Ritz \u2014 Men Only\" or on the streets.\nThe set of the entire play is simple, but effective,\nrealistic. The Siete Mares, where the rich reside on the right, the pawnbrokers and\" Pity \u2014 Men Only\" on the left.\nParagraph eight on the Camino Real review \u2014\nit is Fiesta time, join in the fun, tonight the rising\nmoon will turn Esmeralda, the Gypsy' s daughter,\ninto a virgin, and a chosen hero will be found.\nKiiroy hocks his golden gloves to finance an expedition across the desert and away. Casanova\nwears his crown of horns, oblivious to the crowd's taunts. Hail Esmeralda, the virgin, she chooses\nKiiroy as her hero, he is torn between escape\nand the temptations of the Gypsy's daughter, temptation wins, longer interval.\nParagraph nine on the Camino Real review \u2014\n\" Let's get down to the bar before everyone else\" \u2014\n\" Want a chocolate or a barley sugar, dear?\"\" Now I'm beginning to understand it, the Camino Real\nis obviously that stage in a person's life when he (or she) has to face the agonising reality\nof growing old. If one can accept this then they\ncan cross the Terra Incognita with no problems.\nCasanova's whole life is centred around his virility and as this declines with his increasing age he\ncannot come to terms with it and so is stranded\non Camino Real. Similarly, K il roy s' whole life\nwas his boxing career, when his heart grew weak,\nand the medics wouldn' tO.K. him for any more\nfights he too couldn't face his fate, couldn't face\nold age, so he too remains on Camino Real. Lord\nByron, however, once he has accepted the minor\npoints of old age, is able to return to his poetry\nand can continue writing as long as he likes, so he can blithely walk out of the place. Marguerite\ndwells too much on her past to be able to escape\nno matter how much she wants to\" \u2014 \" We'd better get back now, it'll be starting again soon\". Paragraph ten on the Camino Real review \u2014\nthe Gypsy fills in the chosen hero forms for Kiiroy\nand Nursie brings in Esmeralda. She stretches\nseductively on the couch, two small coiled green\nsnakes guarding her breasts. Kiiroy is too worried about the Gypsy's news that he is next on the\nstreet cleaners list to concentrate on the Job at\nhand. He spends a long time impressing Esmeralda with his sincerity and is finally allowed to lift her veil. He is thrown out by the Gypsy and lands on.... \u2022\nParagraph eleven on the Camino Real review \u2014\nKiiroy is on the plaza, Gutman assists Casanova's exit from the Siete Mares. Kilroy's heart is too\nweak to carry the befriended Casanova's bag into\nits new home, the RITZ \u2014 Men Only. Kiiroy decides to sleep out under the stars, he is joined by Marguerite and when the street cleaners approach\nhe is ready for them. But his resistance is too\nweak, all in vain.\nParagraph twelve on the Camino Real review \u2014\nKilroy's body is being investigated by a dissection\nclass, the instructor removes the heart, a golden\none the size of a baby's head, Kiiroy grabs his\nheart from the instructor and in trying to convince\nthe sleeping Esmeralda he is more than a tom-cat, pawns his heart for a collection of cheap\nstones and furs to impress the sleeping Gypsy daughter. He falls to the dry fountain, broken,\nscrewed, robbed, desolate, a wreck.... Don Quixote awakes and washes his face, cleans his\nteeth in the fresh clean water of the fountain. The crowd of vagrants are stunned, they leap upon\nthe fountain as Kiiroy and Quixote climb the staircase together, towards the Terra Incognita.\nParagraph thirteen on the Camino Real review \u2014\ncredits: The production and direction of Denys\nBennett was as immaculate as \" The Crucible\" and the general standard of acting really excellent.\nAlthough not perfect, it is impossible to fault the\nproduction, a very difficult play indeed to perform,\none which was tackled in a very adventurous and professional manner. The props, costumes and scenery were very realistic and convincing. The only really outstanding individual performance was that of Pat Gorman as Kiiroy, although Steve\nGrove (Gutman) Mike Stranger (Casanova), Penny\nPyke (Marguerite) and Carina Standing ( Gypsy), not forgetting Sheila Hughes (her daughter) supported very well. The play was perhaps too surrealistic for some people to enjoy on the superficial level, but choreography (by Madeline Claque) and superb lighting (by Alec Mac Andrew) enhanced the entire production to such a degree that everyone must have got something out of it.\nIt's a play to think about, to interpret in your own way to workout for yourself; consider your own situation, draw your own conclusions, write your\nown review. \" The curtain line has been said, so lower it\". A men. JEREMY BARKER VACANCY\nThe post of sabbatical editor of FELIX will bec ome vacant starting at the end of this term.\nHold everything! Before you all reach for the\napplication forms, let me tell you that it might\nnot exist next term, dependent on last night's Council decisions.\nFELIX has been in deep financial water since\nhalf term, due to a peculiar side-effect of the economic crises which has made firms change their\nminds about advertising in London student newspapers (except Sennet).\nThey all used to get their ads from one brokers\ncompany which has since packed in all contracts\nwith London student newspapers as even they\ncan't get ads. Before Mines Newsletter pipe up with stories of\ntheir unrivalled financial acumen in extorting a couple of quid's worth of ads per fortnight off\nlocal traders, may il state that FELIX needs over\n\u00a350 per week worth of advertising to avert large\ninjections of Union capital.\nCoupled with this drop in advertising revenue\nhas been soaring newsprint costs which I feel\nmakes the present format of FELIX (8-page\nweekly) no longer feasible.\nAnyone interested in helping with whatever\nmedia project Council decide to back to d is semi nate news, spews and reviews round the College\nshould contact Norm Sayles or Paul Wadsworth in the Union office, either now or straight away\nnext term.\nIn case anyone's wondering why I'm jacking in\nthe student editor scene, the answer can be ded u ced from the statement\"\u00a3400 grant for my third\nyear next year and no parental contribution avail-able\".

Rob All in son did another superman run\n(quote, \" My valuables\nare in- my trousers\"), doing the three-mile\ncourse in 1 5 m27s.

CONSORTIUM IC 0, KINGS 2\nl.C. travelled to Colliers Wood last Saturday to play King's College in the First Round of the U LUC up, which we have won for the past\nthree years. The game\nwas played under arctic\nconditions on a rock\nhard pitch. After five minutes\nStevie Bates was injured\nin a collision with the King's left-back, which slowed him down for the\nrest of the game. This was shortly followed by\ninjuries to Ron (V.P.)

King's had the better of the\nfirst half, but no goals\nwere scored. The referee gave several unusual\ndecisions completly baffling the l.C. team.\nIn the second half\nI.C.'s re-shuffled team\nbegan to settle down and their strength began to\ntell. The King's goal\nwas under a state of\nsiege, but despite constant pressure, l.C. failed\nto create many chances.\nThe two best Chances\nfell to Batesie and Ian\nBell, but both shot wide.

Kings adapted better to\nthe tricky conditions, but\nwere denied any reward\nby I.C.'s solid defence.\nBill Pike opened the\nscoring, following up a Martin Clark shot. Shortly afterwards Kings\nequalise d with a soft\ngoal (Oh what a give-away!). However, the\nKing's goalkeeper was\nlet down by his defence\nand Bill Pike scored two\nmore goals before half-time, including a' Sammy Nelson Special' from thirty yards. I.C. played badly at the start\nof the second half and\nwere only saved by the\ncourage of Andy Roberts\nin goal who made two\nmagnificent saves. I.C. then took over the game\ncompletely and due to\nthe fine Kings goalkeeper could not score more\nthan the single half goal\nfrom Geoff Gilbert.\nTeam: A. Roberts, R. Young, M.

Is it\na decline in interest which has reduced the num ber of football teams from 7 or 8 to a mere 5 this\nseason. Perhaps the present employment situation is press u rising students into getting the best\ndegree, increasing the work load and reducing leisure time? Or could it be the lack of money,\nwhich we are hearing so much about, preventing\nsportsmen joining in the social as well as sporting\nactivities of the clubs. What can be done to im prove the situation, to encourage hidden talent to\ncome forward and enjoy the not to be missed camera de rie of l.C. sports clubs. Perhaps if\nclubs were to use the facility of the Felix sports\npage to publicise their activities, interest may be\naroused, by students being shown that clubs not\nonly exist, but in fact do have some fixtures! It\nis the duty of every captain to see that his club uses its rightful space in Felix to the full, so submit your articles by Wednesday night to the\nSports Ed. c/o Union letter rack.\nBOB B. FLOGGING\nWINTER TERM REVIEW\nThere can be few more nostalgic experiences\navailable to mankind than looking back over a term's golf. Cynics might say \" Rubbish!\" and not\nbe far wrong, but how can one counter such absolutes as \" a birdie at the long ninth\" or \" a ten and8 victory\" without every fibre in the body stiffening\nin supreme exhilaration. Non-golfers usually\nrefer to \" Love\" as the ultimate absolute, but\nthose well versed in the \" rub of the green\" merely\nuse this as something to fall back on when their\nswing fades. Indeed it is worth a moment's thought to think how different man's outlook on\nlife might have been had Jesus been born at\nRoyal Mid Surrey instead of Bethlehem and been\ngiven \" golf CIUDS, membership card and talent\" by the \" three wise men\" instead of the other\nthings. However, that's Christmas, and not the\nmain theme of this article.\nThis article is dedicated to those fine warriors\nof I. C.G.S. Who trudge the noble road to Richmond week after week. Many have yet to appear in a match line-up and so have not been pulled down by the glittering hand of publicity. For them it is\nthe mysterious lure of the game which draws them\nto their fate.\nA review of the term would not be complete\nwithout mentioning our record so far:\nUniversity College lost A\\ Barts Hospital won4^ \u2014 1 1\nx.1412 Kingston Poly won4 i.1112 The reports on these matches have appeared\nin previous editions, so I shall not trouble you with a blow by blow account except to say that\nthe team has improved markedly with each\nmatch and is now extremely formidable.\nThe hard work put in by the committee also\nis notable. Bill Calderwood( vice-captain) has put\nin hours of toil scouting for good players as well as performing his major task of being the first\nteam superstar. Jules Dan has taken on the onerous task of secretary with the zest that Barry\nMackenzie might describe as \" of an abbot uc king into his first fur burger\". Adrian Evans has\nalso added his contribution to the society as\ntreasurer. His tough bargaining technique has led\nto the Union treasury considering our club more\nequal than others, just as his excellent diplomacy has made him a man marked for success. Finally, I have been asked how these society\nreports come about. It's simple. Nigel Foster\nwrites it, Jules Dan reads it, Bill Calderwood changes it, and Adrian Evans pays for it.\nNIGEL FOSTER CABER-TOSSING\ni Following the success of our team against\nthe Caledonian Club of U.C. where we thrashed\nthem 14-1 last Saturday, we turned our attention\nto more manly opposition.\nIt was with high expectations that we went t \u00bb\nNeasden football ground to challenge Willesden and District Freemasons to the sport of men.\nWe took the field first, and Angus McFarland, using his special steel tipped project oca ber,man aged a magnificent 5 6 0 yards to skewer the roof\nof the changing rooms, in which the opposition\nwere cringing. No one was hurt ( much). Despite young brawny Alec Mc Caw ley's excellent throw of 3 4 0 yards, unfortunately, however backwards, we won60 due to the opposition retiring with multiple hernias.\n- HAMISH Mc PSEUDONYM IT ABLE "
