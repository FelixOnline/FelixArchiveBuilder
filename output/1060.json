    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY JUNE 7TH1996 NEWS\nSTOIC triumphs\nPHOTO: MARK BAKER\nCarlo and Robin of STOIC with some of their award winning kit.\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nMembers of STOIC, the Student\nTelevision Of Imperial College,\nhave been celebrating success in\nthe annual student TV awards\nceremony hosted by in Norwich\nby the University of East Anglia's student television station.\nSTOIC have been singled out in\ntwo categories: Best Live\nCoverage and Best News\nCoverage.\nCarlo Masserella, STOIC's Chair, said that the awards were\n\"good for STOIC,\" and that he\nwas pleased that people are\ngetting some recognition for their\nefforts. Mr Masserella himself\nwon the Best News Coverage\naward for a short article about\nthe Internet, while the other\naward was won for the live coverage of the band Urban Spice by a team comprising Robin Riley,\nPiers Williams, Eliott Parish and\nMark Brown. The conference,\nunder the auspices of NaSTA,\nthe National Student TV Association, invited professional\njournalists to judge the entries\nfor the 15 categories.\nOther awards were scooped\nup by Birmingham's student TV,\nUEA's Nexus, and the rest by\nGlasgow University's GUST,\none of the largest and better\nequipped student television\nstations in the country.\n\"Compared to STOIC, GUST is\na much larger operation,\" said\nRobin Riley, Features Editor of\nSTOIC. \"STOIC's strengths are\nin editing, which is at least five\nyears ahead of everyone else,\" he\ncontinued, pointing out that\nwhereas most student TV is done\nby media students, often for part\nof their degree, STOIC's efforts\nwere by relative amateurs.\nTheir entries into the\ncompetition were a bit of an after\nthought, according to Mr Riley:\n\"We were surprised to win\nanything this year, as we didn't go. The tapes were sent off out\nof tradition really.\" He explained\nthat their absence from the\nconference was due to a disagreement over the ethos of the\nawards, and that while STOIC\nmade TV for broadcasting - both\ntheir entries were programmes\nwhich had been broadcast - some\nstations had \"very obviously\nmade programmes specifically to\nwin awards.\"\nMr Riley said that he felt\nthat this went against the spirit\nof NaSTA, and was not what\nthey wanted to do in STOIC,\nand whilst they were pleased to\nwin the awards, \"they don't really mean anything to us.\"\ncontinued from front page\nrisky business\" he said, comparing Ariane 5 to the Space Shuttle\ndisaster. \"There's no reason why\nthis one should have been any\nmore dangerous than subsequent\nones.\"\nThe European Space Agency\nCluster mission was due to spend\nthe next two years in orbit\naround earth to study the interaction between the solar wind\nand the earth's magnetic field -the magnetosphere - which\nprotects the earth from sun's more violent outbursts. These\nobservations would give scientists a better understanding of\nspace 'weather'. They hoped to\nresolve unanswered questions on\nhow the sun causes phenomena\nin earth's environment such as\nthe aurora, power surges in transmission lines and disturbances in\nbroadcasting.\nCluster was a unique\nmission described as a cornerstone experiment by space scientists. \"It would have been enormous.\" said Dr Dunlop. \"The\nsteve: ace\nIC Boat Club's coach, Steve Ellis,\nhas been selected for the British\nlightweight four entering this\nsummer's Atlanta Olympics.\nTrials were held in Lucerne last\nweekend: Steve told Felix that it\nwas '99% certain' he would be\nchosen. \"We rowed better on\nFriday and Saturday than we\nhave done in two years, though\nwe almost balls ed it up on\nSunday,\" he said. Describing the\nselection as being 'un feasibly competitive' he explained that\nthere is only one lightweight\nmen's boat entering, providing\nonly four spaces for Britain's top\n11-stone or under rowers. \"You\ncan't afford to have one bad\nday,\" he said.\nIC Boat club manager Bill\nMason's women's eight will be\ncompeting for a place in Atlanta\nin the Olympic regatta this\nweekend.\nthreat to Ghassan\nDelegates at Tuesday's Imperial\nCollege Union Council were\nmandated to support a no conf i only way to get details of the\nthree dimensional structure of\nthe magnetosphere is to have\nfour spacecraft. Previous\nmissions with only one or two\nspacecraft could only give\nlimited results.\"\nIt is too early to say what\nwill happen to the Cluster\nmission next. According to Chris\nCarr the fundamental need for\nthis research still exists and this\nresearch cannot be done in any\nother way \"Its difficult to know\nwhat will happen. Somebody will\nhave to decide whether this\nscience is important enough to\nlaunch another mission\"\nDr Dunlop is optimistic\nabout the future. He pointed out\nthat although the spacecraft were\nlost, all the research and development has been done. \"Its rather\nlike paying someone to develop\nsome software for ten years and\nthen throwing the computer out\nof the window - luckily the software was backed up, but we need\nsomeone to pay for a new\ncomputer!\"\nden ce vote for the UL U President Ghassan Karian. Mr\nKarrian left his job last week to\ntake up a position as a campaigner for the Labour Party.\nThe a noun cement of the\nmove less than a fortnight after\nhis successor, ICU president\nSarah White, was elected has\nbeen described as \"cynical and\nmanipulative\" by a ULU spokes-man. Ghassan was elected to\ncontinue in his present position\nuntil the end of July, and\nalthough he has resigned his\nsalary, he retains his job status\nwhilst working full-time as\nGeneral Election Campaign\nCoordinator for the West\nLondon area for the Labour\nParty.\nRepresentatives at the\nCouncil meeting were deterred\nfrom pushing for a no-confidence\nvote only by virtue of the fact\nthat it would make the job\nhandover for Sarah even more\ndifficult than it is already. \"I think I would have had a nervous\nbreakdown,\" Miss White com-men ted.

    "content": "MILLIONS of tourists have been photographed doing it, Superman\ndid it once but changed his mind, now, John Burland, Professor\nof Soil Mechanics at Imperial College, hopes to stop the famous\nTower of Pisa from leaning too far. Sarah Tomlin reports.\n> in The Skew from the To werT he leaning Tower of Pisa has been\nclosed to the public since 1989, when\nanother tower in Pavia collapsed,\nkilling four people. Because of the historic and\ntourist value of the tower, the Italian government immediately set up a commission to\ninvestigate ways to save it. The commission\nnow believes the tower could topple over at any\ntime. The overhang is already 4.5 meters on the\nsouth side and it leans a millimetre more to the\nsouth every year. The weakest point of the\ntower is the compressed masonry near the base\non the south side, which is under enormous\nstrain and is in constant danger of exploding\noutwards.\nThe reason why the tower leans in the first\nplace is a lesson for construction engineers\neverywhere. The source of the problem is a layer of very soft clay about ten meters below\nthe tower. Professor Burland compared it to\nbuilding a tower of bricks on a very soft carpet.\nOn the south side of the tower, the clay layer is\nvery slightly more compressible. This is why\nthe tower leans to the south, although according to Professor Burland, the tower would have\nended up leaning anyway.\nYou may find it surprising that the tower\nhas survived to the present day intact but it is\nnothing short of a miracle that construction of\nthe tower was completed in the first place. The\ntower owes its very existence to the changing\nfortunes of Pisa. Work was begun in 1174, but\nconstruction was held up several times when\nPisa ran out of money, or needed it for more\nimportant concerns, like fighting wars. If it had\nnot been for these breaks during construction,\nthe tower would have fallen over a long time ago.\nFortunately, building work was stopped each\ntime just before it became critical, and the passing years allowed the tower to settle down in the\nclay. In fact, the tower was already listing to the\nsouth when the bell tower was finally added two\nhundred years later. The builders tried their own\ncosmetic surgery on the tower by slanting the\nbell tower to the north. Today there are six steps\nto the bell chamber on the south side and four to\nthe north, giving the tower an overall banana\nshape.\nIf the architects of the 12th century were\nbananas to try to build their tower on a layer of\nsoft clay, dre re have been many equally crazy\nattempts to save the tower, some\nwhich have done more damage\nthan good. In the 1930s Mussolini IX\npumped 80 tonnes of cement into the foundations, causing it to tilt even further. In 1991 there\nwas a proposal to chop the tower off at the base\nwith a diamond saw and then straighten it out\nwith hydraulic winches. A number of less\ndestructive measures were taken in 1992. To\nprevent the stone masonry from bursting out-wards, the lower walls were wrapped in steel\ncables. And in an effort to counterbalance the\ntilt, 600 tonnes of lead weights were placed on\nthe foundations on the north side. Professor\nBurland seems pleased with the results so far.\n\"We have reduced the inclination by 2cm and\nthe overturning moment by 14% - in other\nwords, the tower is 14% safer.\" However these\nare only temporary measures to prevent damage\nto the monument occurring before a permanent\nsolution can be found.\nIn 1993 Italian and British engineers began\ntests near the tower to evaluate the viability of\ntwo different techniques. Both hoped to solve\nthe underlying problem in the layer of soft clay.\nCarlo Viggiamo of the University of Naples\nplanned to drain water from the clay on the\nnorth side using electro-osmosis. If the clay\ncould be dried out in this way, it would shrink,\nallowing the tower to sink back down\non this side. Tests in the laboratory\nlooked promising, but engineers who\ntried this technique did not meet with\nsuccess.\nThe other technique on trial\ninvolved the removal of some of the\nsoft clay beneath the north side. The\nmain difficulty with this method is\nthe precarious state of the mon u ment; clay has to be extracted from\nunder the tower without g ready disturbing it. The soil extraction technique developed by John Burland and\nhis colleagues uses specially designed\ndrills, which have external casings only\ntwenty centimetres in diameter.\nThese can be inserted into the ground\nwith the minimum of disturbance,\nand clay can be extracted one cubic\ncentimetre at a time. It is hoped that\nremoving the soil in this highly controlled way will allow engineers to\nmonitor the stability of the tower at all\ntimes. If the work goes ahead and is\nsuccessful, they will reduce the 5.5\ndegree inclination of the tower by\naround 10%. Not enough that the\naverage tourist would notice according to\nProfessor Burland but he is optimistic about the\nfuture of the tower: \"If we are allowed to do the\nsoil extraction we will save it, extending its life by\nanother 500 years.\" And if no work is done? \"It\nwill fall over! We don't know when, but it could\nbe as soon as 2 or 3 years\".\nIf you have a civil engineering problem,\nProfessor John Burland of soil mechanics can straighten it out.\n\n"

In these cases we\nhave lent the crutches anyway,\nasking the patient to sign a pledge to return them as soon as\npossible a fier the patient has\nrecovered.\nWe started this academic\nyear with f6 pairs of crutches.\nNow we have 3 odd ones. Since\neach pair costs \u00a360, this is a significant loss to the Health\nCentre, as well as depriving others of this service\nWe would like our crutches\nback. To this end, we propose an\namnesty. Please return any\ncrutches in your possession by\nFriday 14 June 1996 and we will\ncross your name off our black\nlist. After that date we shall\nregard any non-return of crutches as theft of college property\nand will pass on our list to the\nAcadeinic Registrar asking him to invoke regulation for students\nnumber 2. This means that once\nstudents reach their final year,\nno degree will be awarded until\nthe debt has been settled.\nWe are also writing to all\nthose who borrowed crutches\nand have not returned them.\nThis will demonstrate that we\nknow who they are.\nDr. Irene Weinreb\nDirector,\nClinical Services\nLetters may be edited for\nlength.

Great fun to distribute.\nI 've thrown it at various groups\nof IC staff so I reckon it's about\ntime I blamed the students.\nLet me tell you a little story.\nOnce upon a time I was an\nundergraduate at Imperial. I was-n't a very good one, but I wasn't so appalling as to cause a fuss.\nFalling into that great mass of the\nhigh 2:2 / low 2:1, it's very easy\nto drift along unnoticed. But all\nwas quite happy until I got to the\nend of my second year (by which\ntime my course was, getting a little tricky). I failed a paper, bringing my aggregate below that\nacceptable level of mediocrity\nwhich apparently determines a student's ability to survive in\nEurope for a year.\nI was very disappointed, so I phoned up the relevant member\nof staff to talk about it. He had\nno difficulty in giving me an\nexplanation for his decision, and\nhe said some very unpleasant\nthings about it. No, that's not\nquite true. He was arrogant,\npatronising, unspeakably rude,\ninsulting, unsympathetic and\ngenerally abusive. He told me I was 'a failure and a liability to my\ndepartment.'\nSo what did I do, you ask?\nWell, I took it further. I told my\nfriends. I told my friends'\nfriends, and their cousins. My\nGranny's next-door neighbour's cleaning lady knew. I talked to\nmy brother on the phone for an\nhour about it. (He was in Hong\nKong on holiday at the time).\nBut did I tell anyone useful? Did\nI bugger y.I don't know why. I think I was embarrassed.\nIn the light of the exceptionally noisy building work outside\nthe library I phoned up the sub-librarian last week, all set to\ndemand explanations for the cavalier disregard for students' rev i sion. But it was difficult to maintain my argument when he told\nme that no one had complained\nat all. I went into a meeting with\nIan Caldwell this week's looking\nfor justification for the appalling\nway students in Weeks had been\ntreated. He was very concerned,\nbut not only had he just found\nout, the Weeks' warden had no\nidea that students were unhappy\neither.\nLook, folks, we cannot keep\nw hinging. Call me hopeful, but I reckon that relevant, constructive complaint might achieve\nsomething. You're going to have\nto trust me on this one, but there\nreally are some genuinely\ndecent, dedicated, caring staff\nout there. Use them: I never did,\nand I wish I had. It might not\nhave made any difference, but it\nmight have stopped me wallowing (and fuming!) quite so much.\nEDITORIAL TEAM: NEW S:ALE XFE A KES FEATURES: MARK BAKER SUB EDITING AND PROOFING: TIM ST CLAIR MUSIC: VIK BANS AL CINEMA: KATIE HOPKINS& WEI LEE\nPHOTOGRAPHY: IVAN CHAN PUZZLES: CATFISH CLUBS AND Socs: SANDALS ARTS: JEREMY SCIENCE: BEN WILKINS COLLATING LAST WEEK: TIM, JEREMY AND GIDON DELIVERING LAST WEEK: ANDREW "

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY JUNE 7TH1996. FIVE\nOf course, cuts in the capital grant, which thus far\namount to 33% this year\nand a further 20% for next year\ncould force the universities'\nhand, but this, Mike Hansen\nbelieves, simply reinforces the\ncynical view, that the PFI is\nlargely to reduce the govern-ment's public deficit. The current round of gladiatorial efficiency savings at the Treasury\nM ike Hansen concedes,\nhowever, that the PFI\ncan deliver benefits\nthrough sharing risks and/or\ncosts, and its introduction does at\nleast offer another possible so lu tion. PFI type deals have seen\nservices such as car parking contracted out to private operators -hardly the stuff to whip up controversy in the S CR but what\nBiomedical Sciences building,\nfunded partly by a HE FCE grant\nand partly from the College's reserves, provides evidence that\nthere are easier options than the\nPFI for the university sector. The\nPFI is currently the least preferred option.\nT he mantra does have an\nappealing line, otherwise\nthe other parties wouldn't have joined the chorus proclaim-will put more pressure on the\ninstitutions to charge student's fees at a fair rate, giving them\ncontrol over their own income.\nProfessor Norman Go war, Principal of Royal\nHolloway and Bedford New College, sums up the current quandary: \"the current\n[funding | system has all the disadvantages of a market system,\nwith none of the advantages.\"\nFurthermore, PFI-type projects\nare not new in the university sec-tor, as Mike Hansen states, \"we\nhave operated a common heating\nsystem with the museums for\nthirty five years, and a common library with the science museum\nfor the last three years. This isn't revolutionary, it's common sense.\" It's relevance is further\nundermined by the evidence of\nthe growth of the new universi-ties, who took advantage of the\n1992 borrowing regulations and\nembarked on large expansion\nprogrammes.\nwould you think if your lab was-n't owned by the College? Would you feel less secure if a private\noperator was running your hall of\nresidence?\nO ne extreme view envisaged by mass use of the\nPFI sees universities as\nvirtual entities, merely enabling\nthe provision of teaching and\nresearch through private agree-ment s, rather than asset owning\nproviders - there are already\nplans for an entire campus to be\nconstructed in this way. Such a vision is unlikely to become reality in institutions such as\nImperial, where private firms\ncannot provide the high quality\ndemanded, for the simple reason\nthat no such firms exist at the\nmoment. The College is certainly\nnot prepared to risk its reputation by entering into long term\ndeals with untried firms which nobody has experience in negotiating, simply to impress Treasury\nofficials. The controversial\ning it in the same visionary terms\nas the government. But the solution to capital financing in the\nHE sector cannot be divorced\nfrom the whole problem of student finances. Only when the\nDearing Committee's report is\npublished next summer will institutions be able to make coherent\nlong term plans.\nT here is no doubt that sensible and relevant co-oper-ation between public and\nprivate sector can deliver the\nbenefits that the PFI claims. The\nInitiative in particular needs to\ngain wider private sector\napproval. So long as cynicism\npervades the interpretation\nbehind the scheme, it will take\nmore than the Happy Clappers\nof Whitehall to ensure its long\nterm success.\nby Nooman\nHaque, with\nthanks to Mike\nHansen\nphoto: Mark\nBaker\n\n"

    "content": "book axiomatic greg eg a rw is Sometimes when you\nread a book by a familiar\nI author, you realise that\nthis is the result they were\naiming to produce in their\nprevious attempts.\nAlthough this book is a collection of short stories\nas opposed to a novel,\nGreg Egan has definitely\nhit the mark here.\nNineties science fiction has tended to find\nitself in the doldrums when it comes to new\nideas based on science as opposed to sociology.\n(Cyberpunk is in general the latter.) Egan has\ncome and shown that there are plenty of things\nstill to be played with, although this is not to say\nhe ignores the social aspects of his fictions.\nThe stories are a combination of the older\nareas of weird cosmologies and quantum effects,\nand the newer areas of genetics, nano tech, and\nthe mathematics of chaos, and most of them\nhave a heavy streak of questions of 'self'. To illustrate, the title story concerns the use of nano tech to manipulate the brain, giving a person a new\n'axiom' of behaviour, whilst 'The Moral\nEmbryologist' discusses morals in the age of\nAIDS and 'The Hundred Year Diary' has a set\nup aU owing information, in duding personal\ndiaries, to be received from the future.\nEgan is an up and coming Austalian author\nand this, his third book (in paperback), is his\nmost readable so far. If you chucked SF because\neverything you read could be traced back to\nClarke or Asimov, this collection will renew your\ninterest in the genre. If you have never tried SF,\nthen this is an ideal introduction.\nplay one knights i in thurston-gordon\nThe fear of the armed maniac is a devil which sits\nmenacingly on the shoulder of every seriously\nguilty individual, whether arrested by the state\nor not. 'One Knight', by Simon Francis frighteningly depicts such a nightmare situation. The\n\"hostage\", played by Henry Dunn, can't believe\nthat he's been caught, because the hysterical\n\"kidnapper\" (Ben Shockley) is not part of the\nofficial legal-police-religious merry-go-round.\nThe \"hostage\" treats his kidnapper with\nconcerti c symphony\norchestra\nCopland: Quiet City\nBritten: Piano Concerto\nSibelius: Symphony No. 2\nThe rehearsal time for third term concerts is less\nthan half that for the previous terms.\nNevertheless, this very substantial and ambitious\nprogram was performed with assurance, precision and zest.\nThe original version of Quiet City was composed in 1938 for trumpet, saxophone, clarinet\nand piano as incidental music for an experimental drama of that name intended for New York's Broadway. Steve Hick's controlled and sensitive\nperformance showed that Copland's concern\nwas kind but superfluous; however, it gave us the\nopportunity to experience the matching control\nof Daniel Elsen on the cor-anglais.\nThat same year, 1938, Copland visited\nBritten at the Old Mill at Snape in Suffolk,\nwhere they formed a firm friendship and where\nBritten played him the first version of Britten's Piano Concerto. Only three years before, Britten\nhad lived, as an RCM student, in a minute room\nat 173 Cromwell Road. In that period he had\nwritten a lot of incidental music for the BBC, for\ndocumentary work, and for theatre works by\nWH. Auden. The piano concerto is of that time.\nBritten gave the American premiere at the\nCarnegie Hall in New York. To restore the\nTransadantic balance, forty years later, Copland,\nconducting an 80th birthday performance of\nQuiet City in the Royal Albert Hall, had to abandon the stage when the elderly heating system (it\nwas winter) began to rattle and thump with a volume approaching that of the orchestra.\nSibelius wrote most of his second symphony in the congenial climate of the hills behind\nRapallo in northern Italy. The \"Mediterranean\nLyricism\" of Walton's orchestral writing comes\nfrom a similar location and also the formal structure of his first symphony owes much to\nSibelius. His \"Valse Triste\", which turned him\ninto a cult figure, had originally been written to\naccompany a scene in a play en tided \"Death\" by\nhis brother-in-law. His theatre work was well\nestablished before the composition of the symphonies and crucially augmented his formal abilities. There have been recent studies (reported in\nNature) suggesting that musical experience and\ntt a in ing cross-fertilizes other mental skills. If this\nis true, the dismissive Government attitude to\nmusic in schools needs reassessment. The members of ICSO, following Dickens, Ash scholar-ships, Exhibitions and the joint IC/RCM course,\nform a unique group with their abilities in science as well as in music.\nAxiomatic Ls out now in\npaperback from\nThe Union bookshop has\ncopies.\nFor more u it biT nat io ji on\nGreg Egan see web page\nhit p:,'/ iv un i'.s at tu tna th,e U u. ch/%7E pke U er/ Vgan-Vaxehtm}\ncomplacent contempt, as if he is a naughty child,\nbecause he knows that the kidnapper is committing a criminal offence and will be punished\nfor it.

The appointment this week of a new\nChairman to the PFI panel, Ross\nGoobey (the third in six\nmonths); the withdrawal of Bovis\nfrom the Initiative, citing complexities in the bidding process\nand excessive bureaucracy, and\nrelaxation of some of the\nTreasury guidelines, are all testament to this.\nIn a valiant drive to widen the\ninfluence of the initiative,\npressure is now being put on\nHE institutions to test their projects for its application.\nUniversities are currently\nexempt from a mandatory test to\ndetermine if the proposed project is suitable for private sector\ninvolvement. Supporters claim\nthat it will enable universities to\nbe equipped with the most modern facilities and plan infra st ruc ty borrowing does not affect the\npublic deficit at all,\" thus invalidating the covert reason for the\nscheme's introduction.\nUniversities had assumed\nthat the government\nwas tacitly acknowledging that HE institutions aren't really in the public sector by\nexcluding them from the mandatory PFI test. That they get significant funding from the\nTreasury is irrelevant.\nUniversities are self governing\nestablishments, and as Mike\nHansen states, \"it's got nothing\nto do with the government,\nwhere we get our money from.\nWe can go to a bank, borrow\nfrom the bond market or use the\nPFI; it just depends on each\ncase.\" Mike Hansen epi to mises the pragmatic view: the PFI may\nbe useful for some projects, but\nbecause universities have not historically operated under public\nsector constraints, the scheme\ndoesn't offer anything new.\n\n"

On\nboard were the four Cluster\nspacecraft carrying instruments\ndesigned and built by a team led\nby Imperial.\nAriane 5 took off from\nKourou in French Guiana at 1:35\nGMT. But just 27 seconds into\nthe flight, a guidance system\nfault caused the 750 tonne\nrocket to veer wildly off course.\nThe rocket started to break up\n30 seconds later and ground\ncontrollers decided to end the\nmission for safety reasons. Two\nexplosions were triggered in the\nmain fuel tanks, destroying the\nrocket and its \u00a3500 million cargo.\nOn the launch pad, jubilation\nturned to dismay as scientists\nwatched the burning debris rain\nback down to earth.\nMalcolm Dunlop from the\nPhysics department, one of the\ninvestigators involved in the cluster mission, was watching the\nlaunch via a satellite link up at\nthe Rutherford Appleton\nLaboratory in Oxfordshire. His\ninitial reaction was one of 'd is be lief. The overall cost of the\nproject was over \u00a36 million and\nscientists and engineers have\nbeen designing and building the\nthe instruments in the Physics\ndepartment since 1988.\nChris Carr, a research officer who helped to build the\ninstruments, was watching the\nlaunch from the European Space\nOperations Centre in Darmstadt,\nwhere the mission would have\nbeen controlled from. \"We\ndidn't have a very good view. At\nfirst a lot of us thought we had\njust lost the picture. When we\nsaw the flaming fragments\ncoming down, we realised that\nwas it. Then there was complete\nsilence for what seemed like a very long time\"\nAriane 5 was the first of a new generation of satellite\nlaunchers, the most powerful\never built by ESA. This, the first\nflight, was officially ex peri men tal, and the decision to launch\nthe Cluster mission on it was\npartly in order to keep the cost\ndown. But Malcolm Dunlop\ninsists that the decision to put\nthe satellites on a test flight was\nthe correct one. \"Rocketry is a Continued on page two\nStoic wins awards\nStoic, the student television of\nIC, has won two awards in\nnational atu dent TV awards.\nRobin Riley and Carlo Masserello won prizes for news coverage and live broadcasts, page 2\nDisturbance for weeks\nWeeks Hall students have complained that their exam revision\nhas been disturbed by builders\nconstructing a path beside them.\nWork due to take a week has\nlasted a month. page 3\nEntertain us\nICU Council has approved\nproposals for a \u00a3109,000 refit of\nthe entertainments lounge.

Having\npractically exhausted the potential of the gangster film he has moved onto the horror genre and\nin particular vampires.\nGeorge Clooney (ER) and Quentin\nTarantino play Seth and Rich Gecko, a pair of\nmurderous brothers fleeing for the sanctuary of\nMexico. En route they take hostage a faithless\npreacher (Harvey Keitel) and his children\n(Juliette Lewis and Ernest Hu). Once across the\nborder, they hole up in a sleazy strip joint called\nthe Titty Twister, which also happens to be the\nhome of a brood of blood-thirsty vampires.\nThe film can be split into two essentially different segments with only the five principal characters to link them. The first half is basically a road-movie as the two brothers cut a bloody\nswathe in their run for the border. The second\nhalf, however, is one long extended fight\nsequence as they fight for their lives against the\nbl cK xl sucking fiends. The basic flaw with the\nfilm is that the two sections are too dissimilar to\nwork well with the other. Luckily, both have\nenough merits in their own right to compensate\nfor the disjointed ness. The first section is the more ti ghd y written and directed of the two, allowing us to familiaris e ourselves with die characters before all hell\nbreaks lose. Unlike Tarantino's mobster heroes\nof his earlier films we are given little reason to\nlike the Gecko brothers and for the first half of\nthe film it is they who are the bad guys. With relatively little action going on Robert Rodriguez\n(the director) has had to restrict his normally\nflamboyant directing style and has consequently\nhad to redirect his talent.\nThe second section lets Rodriguez off the\nleash and shows him in his t me element. At this\npoint, the film loses all originality, but remains\nentertaining enough for this to be of little consequence (providing you are not averse to a bit of\nblood and gore). There are, however, enough\nnice touches, mainly humorous for it to never get\nboring or particularly sickening despite the high\ngore content. The fact that they are fighting v am pires has very little importance, apart from several Peter Gashing jokes, as it is merely an excuse\nto kill monsters in as bloody and violent a way as\npossible.\nAlthough not up to Tarantino's early films,\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn is a highly entertaining\nfilm which shows what Robert Rodriguez can\nreally do given half a chance.\nI sarah turner\nfilm: the juror\nThe Juror is a courtroom drama with a differ-en ce. Unlike most films of this type, which deal\nwith the defendant and their lawyer, it revolves\naround the life of a juror, Annie Laird (Demi\nMoore). Annie, an artist and single mother, sees\nher life change dramatically when she is chosen\nto serve as a juror in a trial of a powerful mobster,\nLouie Boffano.\n\"She is at a point\nin her life where\nshe's a little bored\nand looking for a distraction,\" says\nMoore. \"Being a juror doesn't seem to be harm-ful, and it will\nmomentarily take\nher out of what\nshe perceives as\nher humdrum\nlife.\"\nAlec Baldwin\nplays The\nTeacher, hired by\nthe mob to help\nthem win the\ncase by tampering\nwith the jury. He\n'selects' Annie,\nand forces her to influence the other jurors to\nreach a 'not guilty' verdict. To do this, he first\nbefriends his 'pupil' by buying a few pieces of her\nartwork - strange looking wooden boxes, whose\ncontents are supposed to be felt, not seen. Then\nhe threatens to kill her son Oliver (Joseph\nGordon-Levitt), if she does not cooperate with\nhim.\nAnnie's best friend Juliet soon becomes tangled in The Teacher's web of deceit, and after\nspending the night with her, he forces her to kill\nherself; as a warning to Annie. Fearing that he\nwill kill her son as well, Annie takes her son to\nMexico, where\nthe final scenes\nare set. However,\nthe main focus of\nthe film is not the\ncourtroom but\nrather Annie's home life. As\nAnnie, Moore\nmakes an unusual\nsingle mother, but\na likeable chara c ter, who captures\nthe audience's empathy from\nthe outset.\nAlthough some\nparts of the film\nare unconvincing,\nand Annie\nappears to develop a super strong personality, it\ncontains a few surprising twists, which keep you\non the edge of your seat.\nThis is nothing compared to the quality of\nsome of the films released rec end y, but it is easily worth the price of a cinema ticket.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY JUNE 7TH1996. THREE\nWeeks awakes to morning chorus\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nResidents in Weeks Hall have\nrelief from three weeks of building in sight this week, as a project\nto open up Imperial's newly\nacquired garden behind the hall\ndraws to a close. Workmen are\ncreating a path alongside the\nHall, but have raised the ire of\nstudents in the hall who are\ntrying to study for their summer\nexaminations.\nThe students have been\ndriven to complain because the\nwork has continued right into the\nexam period, when the original\nnotice that they were given,\ndated May 15th, said that it\nshould have been completed\nwithin a week. The problem had\nbeen aggravated by the hot\nweather, when students often\nhave their windows open, and the\npressure on space in other study\nareas on campus.\nTalking to Felix, residents in\nthe rooms facing the new garden\nexplained how initially the noise\nhadn't been that much of a pro b lem, but when mechanical\ndiggers and circular saws started\nbeing used, the level of noise just\ngot too much. \"They start at\neight sometimes,\" said one,\nspeaking loudly above the grinding of a paving slab being cut, \"we\nraised a petition, and gave it to\nthe housekeeper, but we were\ntold to take it further.\"\nIndeed, someone did take it\nfurther, responding to a spoof\nposter placed about the hall\nshowing the telephone number\nfor Ian Caldwell, \"Director of\nRevision,\" and rang up the\nCollege's Director of Estates.\nMr Caldwell said that it was\nthe li rst he had heard of the\nproblems, saying that the\nstudents hadn't even spoken to\ntheir Warden about it. But he\noutlined some proposals on how\nthey planned to alleviate the\nnoise, including having set times\nfor slab cutting and digging, or\nrelocating the cutting to somewhere else. He stressed that \"We\nare sensitive to exam pressures,\nalthough some students may not\nbelieve that.\"\nThe gardens behind the Hall\nwere purchased by the College a few months ago as a possible site\nfor an underground sports centre.\nMr Caldwell is keen to encourage\npeople to use the gardens for\nstudy, and the new path is meant\nto provide access. PHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nUCAS director advises\nstudents: do it now\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nStudents should expect to pay\nfees from 1997 according to the\nChairman of the Universities and\nColleges Admissions Service. In a statement this week Tony\nHiggins urged school-leave rs not\nto dei er entry.\nEach year, 40,000 students\nres it their exams to try and\nimprove their grades and go to\ntheir course of choice. This year,\nstudents are being recommended\nto take an alternative course\nrather than res it. \"We are saying,\nif you have a place this year you\nshould take it, otherwise you\nmight be caught out by a fee next\nyear,\" said Mr Higgins.\nThe recommendations come\nduring a climate of funding cuts\nin the higher education system.\nA report published by the Higher\nEducation Funding Council for\nEngland (HEFCE) this week\nrevealed that 79 per cent of UK\nscience, medicine and engineering departments have been\nunable to perform critical experiments due to cuts in Higher\nEducation funding.\nThis news will add to the\nhardship of students who already\nhave threats of a graduate tax and\nthe abolishing of grants hanging\nover their heads. In a meeting of\nthe Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) in February, top-up fees\nof up to \u00a33000 a year had been\nsuggested. At present IC has no\nplans to charge students.\nEnts lounge refit gets\nCouncil qo-ahead\n^ 7\nks-c tte if \u00a3r rsC':c;;,\\nr i Stage\nEntertainments/\nLounge\nlIs\\\\ MLr va.\n:M ICU Council this week approved plans lor the refurbishment and\nexpansion of the Ents lounge. \"It's about time!\" commented Ents\nmanager Mark Home, \"It means that that maybe Ents will be taken\nmore seriously at Imperial, and will bring the Ents here in line with\nother London Colleges\". The \u00a3109,000 refit is due to be completed\nby the second week in September. Although offering a minimal\nincrease in capacity, \"it will provide a vast improvement in the standard of service,\" a thrilled Mark said.\n\n"

    "content": "simon baker\nNay, nay and thrice nay.\nIt's a lie, a vicious lie. OK, I had had a skin ful, but\n'can't dance for toffee' is a heinous libel. Once my\nlawyers had stopped\nlaughing, I decided to take\nno further action. Under\nnormal circumstances, I dance like a demon. Honest, g uv nor, and if you\nwant proof I shall be out this very night bopping\naway to that new-f angled sound the young people call techno, location as yet unknown, but in\nthe presence of witnesses. And as for you Ms\nEditor, one embarrassing moment and Uncle\nSimon's down on you like a ton of the proverbial s! After nearly eight months of my weekly\nelaboration of sound ideas (ranting) with virtually no response from anyone, it was heartwarming to see, as with London buses, two come along\nat once. Richard Halls' letter about the mobile\nphone ban was satisfying on its own - you're on\nmy Christmas card list, Richard - but to receive\ncorrespondence from the Academic Registrar is\nmore than a humble scribe such as myself ever\nhoped for. Modesty forbids me replying to the\ninitial comparisons with Private Eye (flattery will\nget you everywhere), but I must apologise to\nVemon McClure for demoting him and to Nigel\nWheatley lor over billing his part. Since you will\nboth be processing my degree this month, I can\nonly say that you are both wonderful, the best\npeople for the jobs, and I'd appreciate those\nGeneva bank account numbers I asked for.\nMaking excuses, the head count was not made\nby me, but what I said about qualifications was\nthat the 'place of study of your degree' was what\nyou wanted to know rather than where the\napplication is being made to. I took it for granted\nthat the application wouldn't end up at\nAberystwyth. This is a petty point, since the realisation that not only do people in high places read\nmy column but listen to what I say too, fills this\nembittered old hack's heart with joy and makes\nit all worthwhile.\nNow down to business. Sleaze, albeit in\nsmall measure, caught up with the Government\nagain last weekend when one of the Welsh\nMinisters resigned over an alleged affair. While it\nin no way affects his ability to conduct his job, it\nwas good to see that he took the most honourable course, of action. In the same week, the\nWhitewater affair across the Atlantic resulted in\nthree convictions for fraud. In each case the star\nwitness was Bill 'inhalation only' Clinton, and his\ntestimony was completely rejected by the jury.\nPut simply, they believe the President to be lying.\nIt must be remembered that the last time the\nPresident was caught telling pork ies, he (Richard\nNixon) was forced to resign. If Clinton continues\nlike this, he may well follow the same path.\nAdditionally, the man who dodged the draft in\nVietnam is now using the immunity from prosecution granted to a serving soldier to avoid a sexual harassment suit, by\nvirtue of him being com-mander-in-chief and thus a member of the armed\nforces. In Italy, former\nprime ministers Andreotti\nand Berlusconi have been\ncharged with corruption,\nalong with huge numbers of\ngovernmental, industrial\nand judicial figures. Before labelling the mother\nof modem democracies rotten and corrupt, it is\nworth putting into perspective the behaviour of\nwife-swapping, toe-sucking politicians.\nNobody's perfect, but in this case the grass is\ngreener on this side.\nThe BMS building seems to be ticking along\nnicely (although the Chemistry building is\nvibrating ridiculously at times), but the Library\nproject is verging on the farcical. I am one of the\nlucky ones: work started the day after my last\nexam, and I have sympathy for those trying to\nsecure their employment prospects in there at\nthe moment. It is certainly true that the really\nnoisy work is done before opening, and when\nthey say noisy, they are not kidding - it involves\nsmashing concrete and cutting steel with angle\ngrinders. The fact of the matter is that no work\nshould be undertaken on this project during the\nweek. You cannot excavate buildings quiet iy, and\nthe College should not sanction any activities\nthat can potentially damage the prospects of its\nstudents. A little imaginative planning from\nCollege Estates and Schal could undoubtedly\nensure that the job could be done at weekends\nand early in the holidays. Yes, it would cost more,\nbut if the relevant authorities had stipulated in\nthe contract that Schal could not throw money\naway on things such as the thoroughly pointless\nHard Hat' pamphlet and the ever-increasing\nsigns around the site perimeter (if these signs\nwere at the behest of my good friend Mr\nCaldwell, I apologise). I appreciate that you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs, but\nsuch scant regard for students at such a critical\ntime is just not on. If the project had been properly managed, work would have begun last\nOctober, and I would love to hear why this was\nnot done. All I can say is that life here in the sixties at the time of all the major redevelopment\nmust have been awful. Or perhaps students\nwere not viewed as those annoying little sods\nwho limit the scope for conferences in those\ndays.\nIt would seem that English football is again\ndogged with the problem of hooliganism, the\ntwist this time being that it is the players who\nhave committed the mis demean ours. Mr\nGascoigne was apparently the protagonist in the\nwec king of the team plane, damaging a couple\nof TVs. For my money, if they win Euro '96, they\ncan trash the entire Cathay Pacific fleet and I 'll\npick up the tab. In that event, there will be one\ncolumnist sobbing so uncontrollably with joy\nthat the Thames barrier will have to be raised. -\n"
