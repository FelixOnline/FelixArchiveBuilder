    "content": "WALHA80VT~\nLOOKSEC\nby Mobile Optics Inc, ;\nI make no apology for a return visit to the\nVictoria and Albert Museum! It is my favourite\nin the South Kensington cluster of museums\n(muse a?), possibly because it is the least prone\nto invasion by hordes of school children; but\ncertainly, to some extent, because it provides\nsuch a refreshing contrast to science and\ntechnology, whether of the lab/lecture variety\nat IC, or of the glass cabinet/push button\nvariety at the museums of Natural History,\nScience and Geology.\nThe new entrance to the V&A, on Exhibition Road, is now open. It is part-entrance hall, part-gallery, connecting the\nprimary collections of the V&A with the new\nHenry Cole Building, due to be opened next\nspring. Twelve bronzes by Rodin are displayed\nhere. They were given to the V&A by Rodin in\nOctober1914, after being shown at an exhibition of French Art at Grosvenor House\nearlier that year. If Rodin links the Romantic\nand Modern movements in sculpture, then\nthese bronzes are a most appropriate link\nbetween the old part of the museum and its\nnew wing.\nImages from the Theatre Museum\nIn 1985 the Theatre Museum will open in the\nconverted Flower Market in Covent Garden.\nIn the meantime (to break the idea in gently?) it\nwill stage a series of exhibitions in temporary\ngalleries at the V&A. The first of these 'Show\nBusiness'- is in Rooms 70-73, on the first floor.\nIt is a very well staged exhibition. The 'foyer'\nis the entrance to the Big Top, hung with\npeppermint-striped canvas. The three other\nrooms are devoted to performers, production,\nand publicity and place: they are spot lit and\nthe LOOK SEE is accompanied by a soundtrack that cheerfully juxtaposes the Beatles\nwith a coloratura soprano. This aural patchwork reflects the visual patchwork of the\nexhibition as a whole: the Theatre Museum is\nconcerned with all the live performing arts:\n\"...and stay out!\" - an exhibit from Images from\nthe Theatre.\nReview of the Invincible Brigade or Female\nCavalry...The first paper programme did not\nappear in this country till the 1850s, so an\nillustrated playbill had to act both as poster\nand as sources of detailed information.\nProps on show include Garrick' s trick\ndagger with a retractable blade and Mistinguette's pink ostrich feather fan. Cecil Beatonk's costume for Julie Andrews, in the\nEmbassy Ball scene of My Fair Lady, stands\nbeside Adam Ant's from the Prince Charming\nRevue. The principle boy's costume worn in an\n1880s pantomime conveys all the Victorians'\npreoccupation with opulent curves and contrasts brashly with Marcel Marceau' s expression of awed intensity as he watches a seed grow (in a black and white still, blown up\nto life size).\nIt's very much an exhibition of bits\u2014but\nsome of them are gems, and certainly worth an\nodd half hour one lunchtime.\nWhere, When \u00a3?\nThe V&A is closed on Fridays and on Sunday\nmorning.

Among the pieces they are playing\nis 'The Planets' by Hoist, which consists of\nseven movements, which for convenience I shall number (and refer to as) one to seven.\nI caught up with Andy, Brian, Chris and\nDominic (one of whom is a string player, one of\nwhom is a woodwind player, one of whom is a brass player and one of whom is a percussionist( nobody plays more than one instrument)) in the Queen's Legs the other\nday. Eager to find out more about this\nwonderful suite by Hoist, I asked them for their\npreferences. Before you hear what they had to\nsay, a word of warning\u2014musicians are not all\nstrictly honest, and the accuracy of their\nstatements is. governed by the accuracy of the\ninstruments they play. Hence:\na) String players don't always hit the right\nnote, and hence they tell alternately truth, then\na lie, then the truth, etc (although not always\nnecessarily the truth first).\nb) Woodwind players cannot easily alter the\naccuracy of the note, and so always tell the\ntruth.\nc) Brass players will start off honest, but as\nthe results of excessive alcoholic indulgence\nset in, they start lying; thus every statement\nthey make which contains the words five, six\nor seven is false, any other statement being\ntrue (eg \"1 is better than 3\" would be true, \"3 is\nbetter than 5\" would be false).\nd) Percussionists always play too loudly, in\nthe wrong places, and in the wrong tempo, and\nso every statement they make is false.\nNow back to the conversation.\nBrian steeled himself to speak first \"1 is\nbetter than 4\" he ventured. \" And six is better\nthan 3\" said Andy. \"But 2 is better than 6\" said\nChris. \"7 is better than 6, as well\" said Brian.\n\" And7 is better than 5, old boy\" said Dominic.\n\"Strange, but 4 is better than 7\" said Andy. \"I agree fully\" said Dominic. \"3 is better than 5,\"\nsaid Chris, \"although two is better than 3.\"\n(this counts as two statements). \"7 is better\nthan 2,\" said Brian, \"and 2 is better than 5.\" \"But\nlisten, old boy,\" said Dominic, \"6 is better than\n4.\" \" Oh no,\" said Andy, \"4 is better than 6,\" no\ndoubt thinking of the luscious trombone bits.\n\"There's at least 2 movements better than 5\nthat are worse than one\" said Dominic as\nChris departed with a viola player, thereby\nending the conversation.\nAt this moment the conductor extricated\nhimself from the clutches of a barmaid, wandered over, and told me that in fact their\npreferences were all in the same order (the\nconductor incidentally, is a woodwind player).\nSo who then was from each section, and in\nwhat order did they put the pieces?\nAll similarities to any persons alive, dead, or\nthis year's chairman are entirely intentional.\nOrchestra members note that the order of\npreference does not coincide with the author's nor are the people portrayed necessarily in the\ncorrect sections.

    "content": "Black Balls\nand Exiles\nFour Hundred Pounds by Alfred Fagon\nand Conversations in Exile by Bertolt\nBrecht, adapted by Howard Brenton,\ndirector Roland Rees, Royal Court\nTheatre Upstairs. Foco Novo Theatre\nCompany.\nA double-bill, each piece featuring the same\ntwo black actors Gordon Case and Stephan\nKalipha. The plays have the themes of exiles\nand the game of pool in common. Four\nHundred Pounds concerns two black partners\nwho play pool for a living, surviving by\ngambling on their game. The story begins with\na dispute between the two, which threatens\ntheir long friendship. Tecee (played by Case)\nhas deliberately potted the white ball with the\nblack at the end of a frame which carried a stake of four hundred pounds, thus losing both\nthe game and the money.\nThe heated argument continues, with Tecee\ndisplaying his disillusionment at his hand-to-mouth existence. He feels that he must pursue\na more stable and worthwhile lifestyle. Bees,\nhis partner, cannot believe or understand this\nchange in Tecee, and has a different attitude to\ncoping with being black in Britain. He prefers\nto stay out of the system, he's a survivor who\nis content to scrape a living playing pool.\n\u2022 I REVIEWS Hi The second play, Conversations in Exile,\nwas written by Bertolt Brecht and adapted by\nHoward Brenton (who wrote The Romans in\nBritain). In this production Case and Kalipha\nplay Kalle and Ziffel respectively, two exiles\nfrom Nazi Germany who meet in a bar in\nFinland. As in the first play, the two characters\nhave different viewpoints and attitudes\u2014Kalle\nis a socialist and Ziffel a capitalist businessman\nand physics researcher. They begin a game of\npool and as their evening progresses they\ndiscuss topics such as freedom, passports,\nfascism and cockroaches. Often Kalle and\nZiffel agree but each arrives at his conclusion\nvia a different route from the other.\nThe importance of the pool game in the\naction of Conversations is negligible. More to\nthe point, what chance would there be of\nfinding an American pool table in a bar in\nFinland in 1940? None! Presumably this pool\ntable which has travelled in time and/or space\n\u2022is part of Howard Brenton's adaptation of\nBrecht's original work. The playwright of Four\nHundred Pounds is obviously not a pool player\neither since his characters refer to 'reds' in a pool game. Evidently he is confusing snooker\nwith the aforementioned American poor\nimitation.\nPossibly the most important reason for\nshowing these plays as a double bill is that they\npresent black actors in one play which features\nblacks as characters (Tecee and Bees) and in\nanother play which doesn't. Historically there\nhave been few theatrical opportunities for\nracial minorities, for example blacks would\nActing\nand Overacting\nMan and Superman by Bernard Shaw,\ndirected by Patrick Dromgoole; Theatre\nRoyal, Haymarket.\nIn last week's review of Major Barbara at\nthe Cottesloe Theatre I mentioned that the\nplay was one of three by means of which Shaw\nconverted the theatre into a place of\nprovocation and debate. Man and Superman,\nwhich has just opened at the Theatre Royal,\nHaymarket, is one of the others (the third\nbeing John Bull's Other Island).\nPeter O' Toole takes the part of John Tanner, the play's central character. Tanner is\na rather cynical bachelor who has earned\nmistrust and contempt because of his little\nbook Maxims for Revolutionists from the\nRevolutionist's Handbook and Pocket\nCompanion by John Tanner MIRC( Member\nof the Idle Rich Class). A will entrusts Tanner\nwith the guardianship of a beautiful lady by the\nname of Anne Whitefield (played by Lisa\nHarrow of BBCTV' s Nancy Astor), but this\nhas to be done jointly with Octavius Robinson,\na delicate and aspiring young poet (Timothy\nAckroyd), who has a naive understanding of\nlife and women. The plot is too complicated to\nelaborate here but the character of Tanner is\nquite clearly Shaw's mouthpiece. John Tanner\nturns morality upside-down and exposes the\ngrasping cunning ness of women when it comes\nto love and marriage. Man and Superman is an\nextremely clever play, full of comic misunderstandings and superb jokes.\nThe production is an accomplished one, but\none did have one's doubts at the beginning,\nnamely, Mr O' Toole. After the first five\nminutes of the play, which comprised some\nexcellent acting, Mr O 'Toole burst upon the\nstage shrieking at the top of his hoarse voice\nPeter O 'Toole as John Tanner\nlike a distraught warthog eyeing a stampede of\nrhinoceros approaching in all earnestness. His\nspeech was often incoherent, with the ends of\nhis words frequently slurred, and he staggered\nabout the stage, his feet not knowing where\nthey were going and his long slender legs\nlooking as if they were going to give way any\nsecond. Anyone would have thought the man\nwas pissed. Yes, his acting was almost embarrassing. Success and fame have clearly\ngone to Mr O' Toole' s head, making him\nbehave like a male prima donna. However,\nafter this initial outburst, things did seem to\nimprove a great deal (unless I was getting used\nto it). When Mr O 'Toole spoke in a quiet\nmanner he did hold the stage and one's attention magnificently.\nThe acting from the rest of the cast was\nexcellent. Particular mention must go to Lisa\nHarrow, James Grout as Roebuck Ramsden,\nand Michael Byre as Henry Straken, a motor\nmechanic. Despite Peter O 'Toole's excesses,\nthis remains a very commendable production.\nNick Bedding\nGordon Case in Pot Black pose.\nonly be cast parts in productions such as Loue\nThey Neighbour or Mixed Blessings or be\ncalled upon to play the stereotyped black. The\nnumber of black Macbeths or Hamlets is small.\nThat is, actors from ethnic minorities have not\nbeen judged on merit. Some progress is being\nmade to recognise the talents of black actors.\nYou may have noticed the token black\nsyndrome in advertisements recently. That is,\nif an advert features more than say six different\npeople then one of them must be non-white. In\nthis way the advertising media pays lip service to ethnic minorities\u2014they acknowledge they\nexist. But in how many adverts featuring only\none person is that person black? I can only\nthink of one and the character in that advert is\nLenny Henry who is already well-known.\nNick Hill\nCamelot\u2014the film\nMy first reaction on hearing that Camelot was\na musical based on the legend of King Arthur\nwas skepticism. My suspicion was increased\nwhen it became apparent that the model for\nthe story was TH White's The Once and\nFuture King whose subtle blend of gentle\nhumour and pathos would, I thought, transfer\npoorly to the more brash medium of song and\ndance. But, on leaving the cinema I felt it could\nhave been much worse. Vanessa Redgrave\nadds some sparkle to the acting and the\ncostumes and the sets lend a feel of\nauthenticity and a certain excitement to the\noverall spectacle. The generally turgid dialogue\nis improved by the odd sharp one-liner and it\nmakes a gallant attempt to tell the whole story\n(not an easy task).\nHowever, now to the less savoury elements;\nthe songs are only noteworthy because of their\nim mem or ability. As for the story, it starts well\nenough but falls to pieces, not seeming to\nknow which way to go in the last hour, and the\nfilm as a whole suffers from the Hollywood\nconception of England and the English. It also\nsuffers (with a few exceptions) from a lack of\nimagination with the camera, and I got rather\ntired of seeing close-ups of the face of Richard\nHarris (Arthur) complete with furrowed brow\nwhen he's about to make some (supposedly)\nprofound statement.\nIn short, it's worth a look at if you're a fan of\nmusicals but otherwise unremarkable.\nFELIX November 26, 1982 Page ll "

    "content": "sPORT\nQ Sailing\nFor probably the first time in\nliving memory, the entire IC team arrived early at Waterl oo \u2014 undoubtedly a team in winning form (?). On arrival at\nFarnham station, however, the\npromised lift didn't materialise\u2014Surrey University's idea of\nteam transport turned out to be\nGraham' s bike!\nHaving finally got onto th\nwater, IC made a traditional\nstart to the first race \u2014 Howarth got entangled with the starter's launch whilst Kennedy executed\na copy book, but slightly pre-mature, victory roll. Not to be\noutdone, Howarth stopped at\nthe windward mark to wait for\nthe other boats, and used the\nopportunity to tie his old wreck\ntogether again. This gave Surrey\nthe race with Ist, 2nd and 3rd positions.\nThe second race was a rather\nbetter display of sailing and,\ndespite Be van's muttering something about his rudder dropping off, IC won convincingly. Surrey were evidently\nalarmed at this threat to their\nmacho image, and refused to sail\nthe third and final race \u2014 IC thus\nwon the match 2-1 by default.\nThanks to Pat (that's not very\ngood, is it) Mills for demonstrating his Hooter!\nTeam: Bennett, Bevan, Dalton,\nHowarth, Kennedy, Tostevin.\nThree members of the sailing\nClub: James Baxter, David Chadwick and Graeme Castle\nmade up half of the UL team\nwhich sailed at Liverpool and\nManchester last weekend. Just if ying their position as the\nBritish Universities champions\nthe team beat Liverpool and\nManchester Universities easily,\nthe other visiting team from Nottingham gave UL closer racing but were also defeated.\nRifle & Pistol\nThe Club outing to Bisley on\nSunday was a tremendous success. Panic set in at an early\nstage when Steve Harrison( Club\nCaptain, contact via Elec Eng letter-racks) succeeded in losing\nat least half the squad. Mean while the remainder were being\nFELIX HH HH HH H kH reassured by Gordon that the\nweather was certain to get worse\n(prophesy correct).\nEventually when all were present, the morning's shooting\ncommenced at 300 yards. The\nlate feature was Jonathon, his\nalarm clock having baffled his\nenormous brain. Steve's costume\nwas commented on by everybody\nat Bisley, the N SRA being besieged by blinded marks persons (!) requiring sunglasses.\nHigh scores were recorded by\nAndrew Hamilton(47), Neill\nWood(45), T Higgs (45), Mark Bourke (43), Pauline Pike (43).\nA wet lunch was followed by a very wet afternoon and conditions of near invisibility over\nthe 600 yard range. Pauline, Caroline and Julia modelled a sensational new line in contour-hugging wet jeans. However the\nin s tense cold rain reduced T Higgs usual ard our. High scorers in the afternoon were\nSimon All port and Andrew( yet\nagain).\nLast Wednesday saw a heroic\ntriumph by IC over St Marys Dental Hospital and London Medical Hospital. St Marys were\ncompletely outclassed while IC and London had a very close\nmatch. Results: IC577,L HM C572, St Mary s523,T Higgs 89.\nFine performances were given by\nNoel, Seamus and Neill.\nQuote of the week by Neill\nWood:\" Jane makes me shave\ntwice a day otherwise it hurts her\nlegs.\"\nBoat\nIC Boat Club reaffirmed their\nstatus as the top rowing club in\nUL at the All om Cup Regatta\nfor London colleges last Saturday. They won eight out of the\neleven events as well as being hot\nfavourites for the yet to be\nrowed Senior C eights final.\nHighlight of the day was the\nopen eights final where IC showed their class beating St\nThomas' Hospital by two and a half lengths. Other top class\nperformances were turned in by\nthe open cox ed four who won by\nseven lengths, the women's cox ed four, the men's senior C cox ed four and Bill Bradbury\nwho won both Senior C and\nopen sculls against tough opposition. Other winners were\nthe novice 8 who won their event\nwith ease and Simon BoydeNovice Sculls.\nCrew: Open 8: M Greaves, W Downing, J Griffiths, D Allen, JO 'Brien, E Mendez, T Anderson,\nP Edwards, Mastoid.\nOpen 4: JO 'Brian, G Harding,\nThe new cox ed four 'Stuart Rockell', named on Morphy Day\nJ Griffiths, W Downing, S A Tenwatts.\nSenior C8:/ Lamplough, R Gee, A Wright, S Maddin, S Boyde, R Stanley, D Moreton, N Walkins, M Urch.\nSenior C4:/ Lamplough, R Stanley, D Morton, N Watkins,\nM Urch.\nNovice8: A Buchinger, R Lucas, W Trewlella, M Kingswood, P McNamara, I Chapman,\nS Markhurge, J Taylor.\nCross Country\nThe IC runners arrived at Bath\nUniversity in plenty of time to\nallow enough recovery after the\nhike up the hill from the station.\nOnce again we made up the\nmajority of the London University team\u2014the remainder arrived\njust before the start after a visit\nto one of the local hostelries.\nIt wasn't surprising then that\nfour of the six scoring runners\ncame from I C.Andy Griffiths\nwas first man in in thirty-seventh\nplace with Tasso Asteria des running very well to finish thirty-ninth, having just resumed\ntraining after a neck injury.\nThe following also completed\nthe five mile course without falling in the quarry and helped\nLondon University retain its\nfifth position overall in the\nleague: Rob Morrison, Nick Fenwick, Graham Harker, Hugh Dixon, Steven Taylor and\nJon Frost (Capt).\nBasketball\nIC vs St Marys 52-66\nHaving been beaten the previous\nnight by Baro Road, we were\nfaced with another tough fixture\nagainst St Marys, last year's league winners. Only six players\nmade the trip to Twickenham( all in Andy's Ford Escort), and\nif it wasn't for Ken' s incredible\nI November 26, 1982\nnavigating we wouldn't have got\nthere at all! The match was played with a distinct lack of substitutes and in front of a co rwd of about forty\n'hostile' people. Brian's( casual)\n'3 point plays', Ken' s( even more\ncasual) hook shots and an inspired team performance gave\nus a well deserved half-time lead.\nSix minutes into the second\nhalf the strain started to show in\nour team. Lack of concentration,\nbrought on by tired legs, gave St\nMarys the chance to develop a ten point lead.\nA morale raising team talk\nmanaged to stop the rot from\nsetting in, but, try as we might,\nwe couldn't reduce the lead. The\nrefereeing didn't help our cause\nbut in the end a very satisfying\nresult.\nTeam: Brian, Tim, Kastio,\nTammann, Andy and Ken.\nCycling\nAnd so five were chosen by fate\nto commence glad a to rial battle\nwith the demigod distance, aided in his evil ways by the\nelemental wind. On trusty steeds of iron and\nReynolds 531 they set out from\ntheir home, steadily beating distance into the ground. Di stance in his turn threw hills and\ndetours at them, and wind fought ceaselessly.\nThe five passed a castle( closed for winter) and a Roman villa (closed for lunch) finding\nno aid. Eventually time out was\ncalled at a hostelry in the barren\nout land near Shoreham.\nThe second round proved easier, with distance on the run.\nWind, sensing the turn in events,\nopted to aid the gallant five as\nthey returned, triumphant to the\ncrystal city.\nThe rules state: \" Winners stay\non\", so this week battle will be\nresumed as other wheeled stallions depart. The faces may\nchange but the fight goes on.\nnH HM HH HH H HPa gelS "

    "content": "Food for Thought?\nLast year the three constituent\ncollege unions spent over \u00a32,000\non fresher s' dinners. Now \u00a32,000\ndoes not strike me as a large sum\nwhen discussing union finances,\nbut it is worth asking if anyone\nderives any benefit from this\nexpenditure, particularly since\nlast week's Guilds UGM came\nvery close to telling the Union's: officers to stop fresher s dinners\naltogether.\nFreshers' dinners give new\nstudents the opportunity to get\nto know staff and students from\ntheir own department and generally to have a pleasant\nevening social ising. That anyway\nis the sales patter used to\npersuade fresher s to part with\ntheir money. How far the\ndinners come up to these ideals\nis the subject of this article.\nInevitably it is based on my\nexperience of the dinners organised by Guilds; those run by\nR CSU and R SMU may not be as\nbad.\nby Jon Stanley\nAttendances at the dinners has\nfallen over recent years; an\nextreme example is DOC\u2014less\nthan twenty people went to this\nyear's fresher s' dinner compared\nto over 130 in my first year.\nFew people are satisfied that\nthe meal they receive is worth\n\u00a38.50 per head charged by Mr Mooney. I have never heard\nanyone describe the food as better\nthan 'tolerable*.\nVery few people enjoy the\ndinner enough to want to come\nto another in their second or\nthird year. Moreover a significant number actually feel they\nhave been \"ripped off by the\nUnion\u2014hardly a good way of\nencouraging participation in\nother union activities.\nFew staff attend the dinners\nThose who do often only go\nbecause they feel it is their duty\nto be there.\nFinally, if fresher s' dinners are\na way of meeting other students,\nit is certainly not the only or\nmost important way (can you\neven remember who sat next to\nyou at your fresher s' dinner?)\nNot going to a fresher s' dinner\ndoes not blight you for the rest\nof your time at IC (I never went\nto mine in my first year and it\nhas not done me any harm!)\nThe Guilds President was only\nable to prevent the 'stop the\nfresher s' dinner' motion being\npassed by promising to change\nnext year's dinners ( and by stopping anyone from opposing\nhis amendments).\nSuccessive presidents have\npromised to improve fresher s' dinners. Nothing has changed\nfor the better; in fact they have\ngot worse.

    "content": "Last week Phil Nathan gave the reasons for re-affiliation to the NUS. This week Paul Simion\nand J Martin Taylor give the other side of the\nargument.\n...And those against\nImperial College Union was a founder member of the NUS in 1922 but\nhas had an unsteady relationship with it throughout its history. When\nwe last d is affiliated in January 1978 it was after the longest ever period\nof membership, just seven years. The referendum which ended our\naffiliation had, it is true, a slim majority for the anti-NUS side.\nHowever, last week's article fails to point out that a second referendum\nheld a year after the first reaffirmed our decision to leave the NUS by a majority of nearly 350 despite the strong pro-NUS campaign organised\nby the ICU President and other officers.\nWe believe that the arguments against joining the NUS are as\nstrong as ever, and that if a politically motivated minority were able\nto persuade enough people to vote for re affiliation it would be a major financial disaster for ICU. So in this article we have examined\nthe collection of distorted facts and half-truths put forward last week\nas 'overwhelming evidence' for affiliating to the NUS, and outlined\nthe powerful arguments against it.\nRepresentation to Government\nLast week it was said that the\nNUS 'negotiates' with the DES on grants, prescription charges\n(sic), etc. In fact the NUS is\nneither officially recognised as\nrepresenting students nor is it\nnegotiated with in any way by\nthe Government. Ministers from\nthe DES do talk to NUS representatives when they request a meeting, but they have also met\nICU sabbatical officers in the\npast, and it could be argued that\nministers are more likely to take\nviews from ICU directly if we are\noutside NUS. Anyway the most\neffective way of influencing Government policy is by corresponding with ministers and MPs which ICU frequently does and\nwhich is open to all students.\nWith grants what happens in\npractice is that the NUS every\nyear calculates a grant claim\n(invariably of huge proportions)\nbased on the past value of the\ngrant and sends it to the Govern ment. Last year this was 17.3%\n(although they said it should\nhave been 30%!). The Govern ment then gives us an increase\nbearing no relation whatsoever\nto the NUS demand ( 4 % last\nyear). To describe this as\nnegotiation is a misuse of the\nEnglish language. To quote from\nlast week's article: \" It is the\nstrength of NUS... which gives us\na4% grant increase.\" That\nspeaks for itself, NUS is obviously not very strong!\nIn fact since the NUS started\nissuing demands for grant increases in1962 the real value\nhas fallen by 30%. The fact that\nstudents are seen as a soft targets\nby all Governments whatever\ntheir political complexion is at\nleast partly due to the still widely held public image of students as scroungers who spend all their time on demonstrations and sit-ins, which the\nNUS is instrumental in perpetuating.( Last year the NUS called\na 'strike' of students in support\nof its grant claim.)\ntin ue dd is affiliation is the crippling costs involved in joining. The subscription and associated costs of conferences,\netc, would add up to around\n\u00a320,000 or9% of the Union's income from all sources. But even this percentage is misleading ly low. Much of the Union's income merely passes\nthrough the accounts for reasons\nof good book-keeping and is not\navailable to the Union to dispose\nof as it wishes, for example J Martin Taylor\nPage 61\nThe NUS it is said prevented\nthe introduction of student loans. In reality, whatever the\npros and cons of such a system\nthe Government has so far not\nintroduced it because of the high\ncost involved, which is unacceptable to the Treasury.\nThe Cost of NUS\nIrrespective of the arguments\nagainst NUS membership on the\ngrounds that it is a useless\norganisation the most overwhelming argument for con \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 November 26, 1982\nPaul Simion\nsalaries and insurance. Taking these fixed costs into account\ngives a figure of about 15% of all\nICU's disposable income, so a cut of this amount in the money\navailable for clubs, societies,\nentertainments, CC Us and other\nstudent activities would be the\nonly way to raise theN US affiliation fee. Yet last week's article describes financial arguments against NUSa s 'foolish and short-sighted'. We do not believe that the dubious\nbenefits of NUS membership are\nworth a great reduction in the\nsporting, recreational and social\nfacilities provided by the Union, which are after all the primary\nreasons for its existence.\nThe Sad History of NUS Services\nUp until 1976 NUS owned and\nran a large number of service\ncompanies including Endsleigh\nInsurance, NUS Services Ltd and NUS Travel. In1976 NUS Travel went bankrupt. The\nknock on effect of this was that\nall the NUS companies went into\ndebt, NUS Services also went\nout of business and Endsleigh\nwas sold to the Dutch company\nGouda. NUS's only remaining\ncompany, NUS Marketing, which runs the discount card\nscheme, is losing money since\nthe Midland Bank stopped buying the cards and NUS are\ntrying, unsuccessfully as yet, to\nsell it. And yet last week's article\nsuggests NUS is the organisation\nto ask for financial advice!\nSuch student services that are\ncurrently available, such as\nRailcards and IS IC cards, are\ncommercial ventures which have\nno connection with N US.L on don Student Travel was set up\nafter the collapse of NUS Travel\nand is owned jointly by the travel industry and some student\nunions in London, including ICU. End sleigh is run quite\nindependently of NUS, is no\ncheaper than other insurance\nbrokers and only keeps using the\nNUS name in order to win student customers. ICU can when it requires purchase goods\nthrough the student union buying consortiumS USO C, which has no direct connection\nwith NUS. NUS Organisation\nLast week's article decries the .\nnotion that NUS is ineffectual\nand badly organised. One only\nneed examine the current strike\nby NUS staff to see otherwise. In\nan effort to introduce a modicum\nof efficiency, changes in working practice were proposed which\nthe staff rejected and then walked out, leaving the NUS paralysed. In truth NUS is a large bureaucratic organisation\nemploying around seventy permanent staff and five sab-bat ical s at its London head quarters and several regional\noffices, in addition to which there are numerous regional sabbaticals and permanent staff.\nNUS Democracy\nIt is true that NUS is examining\nways of having compulsory elections for delegates. There is\nnothing new in this, they've been\nlooking at it for years. But there\nwill always have to be exceptions\nfor the numerous small colleges\nwhich haven't the facilities to\nhold elections. It is from these\nsmall colleges that most of the\npolitically extreme delegates\noriginate. There are so many of these small colleges that their\ndelegates form a large block at\nthe conference, and it is difficult\nto even find out how their delegates are appointed. The present drive for democracy in NUS is unlikely to change the\npresent situation significantly.\nThe political make up of the\ndelegates is reflected in the election results\u2014every year over\n2 5 % of theN US Executive consists of Trotskyists and other\nextremists. Quite apart from the\nhorrific situation whereby candidates are elected on party\npolitical slates rather than their\ni FELIX\n\n"

All the\nremaining copies are now in the\npossession of Guilds. The newspaper was produced by\nNick Pyne at his own expense,\nand unless Guilds redistribute\nthem at some point in the future,\nthey are open to exactly the same\ncriticism as they aimed at its\npublishers.\nLeukaemia Sufferer\nBarrie Holt of the Holland Club has heard news of a ten-ye'ar-old\nleukaemia sufferer who is trying\nto get into the Guinness Book of\nRecords by receiving more letters than any other private\nindividual over a given period of\ntime. If anyone wants to help,\nplease write to Paul, PO Box26, Paisley, Scotland.\nChristmas FELIX\nNext week there will be a normal\nFriday FELIX as usual. The\nfollowing Friday, December 10,\nthere will be a FELIX Careers\nbrochure instead of a regular\nissue, and the Christmas FELIX will appear on the following Tuesday, December14. Any ideas for features, humorous articles, cartoons and general\nfestive merriment will be gratefully received.\nImpossible Without....\nany of the regulars, and lots of\nnew people too.

Iam not talking about interrupting\nsomeone else's oratory in order\nto make a correction or a joke or\nto ridicule the speaker; this is a very easy and cheap way of\nputting the speaker off, and one\nwhich students, with their customary habit of flippant repartee, tend to overdo. But\nwhen faced with a large crowd,\nall of whom are listening, and\nnone of whom will prompt, heckle, offer any encouragement\nat all, the man behind the lectern\ncan be the loneliest man in the\nworld.\nStephen Goulder, for instance,\nis far more nervous on formal\noccasions than he appears Welcoming fresher s at the Rector's Reception on the first\nday of term cost him a night's sleep worrying about how his\nspeech would be received. And Mary Freeman (who on that\noccasion had had rather too\nmuch sleep and showed up half\nan hour late) dried up completely\nin the middle of her welcome\nand sat down mid sentence leaving both herself and her\naudience horribly embarrassed.\nOther speakers tend to the\nopposite extreme, and ramble on\nincessantly while not actually\nsaying very much.\nAll of which brings me to the\nHG Wells Society whose chairman proposes a vote of thanks\nto the lecturer at the end of the\nweekly lecture. Last year this job\nwas taken by Pallab G ho sh of\nFEUxmwmmmsmmsm\nPhysics 3, who, with his usual\nnervous courtesy, managed to\nperform his appointed duty quite efficiently by spending the\nentire lecture preparing his vote\nof thanks rather than listening to\nthe lecturer. This arrangement\nresulted in the vote of thanks\nbearing little relation to the talk,\nbut otherwise was quite satis-factory.\nThis year, however, one Mike Mc Clancy has taken on the job\nand he seems to be trying to cram as many gaffes as\npossible into each speech, falling\nover himself in his nervousness\nto use the least sensitive wording\navailable. When will he realise, I wonder, that saying \" I'm sure\nthere are lots of questions you\nwant to ask,\" invites disaster\nwhen there aren't. To be fair, it was cruel of\nMagnus Pyke to tell an anecdote\nabout how on a previous occasion he had refused to answer\nquestions from the audience, when he had previously asked\nMike to invite feedback. And two weeks ago it was hardly\nMike's fault when John Papw or th of the Fourth World Society started insulting the\naudience because they couldn't think of any questions to ask.\nBut the classic in awfulness\ncame after BBC's Graham Massey gave a talk on the\nHorizon programme. After wards, Mike shambled out to the\nfront and, following the usual\nclich es about an interesting and\ninformative talk, said that he\nhoped Mr Massey would be able\nto come back in a few weeks\n\" well, maybe months... er...I mean, a few years, and that then\nhe'll have something worthwhile\nto say.\" At this pont he was\nabout to give way completely\nwhen, to the total astonishment\nof the gathering, the normally\nintrovert Pallab G ho sh vaulted\nthe front bench, beamed up at\nthe audience and, without preamble, began to tell an exceedingly boring joke. On reaching the punchline he sat\ndown again amid expressions of\nastonishment from the disbelieving audience; the only man who\nrefused to be nonplussed was\nMr Massey who proceeded to\npelt Mr G ho sh with pieces of\nchalk.\nLAST YEAR for the Christmas\nCompetition, we asked for appropriate anagrams of people,\nplaces, buildings or institutions\nconnected with IC.( One of the\nprize winners was an anagram of\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY which became ONE PLACE OF MINCED LOGIC THEY ALL RECOGNISE.) This year,\nI'm looking for appropriate acrostics of suitable targets, and\nas before there's a large Christmas pudding for the best.\nWhen the New Statesman\nasked for acrostics of large organisations they were rewarded\nwith ALITALIA: Always Late\nIn Takeoff Always Late In Arrival, WAT NEY: Weaker And Tasting Nastier Every Year\nNovember26, W82WBBBBBBHBBBT~\nand WIMPY: We Include More Potato Yearly. Entries from students and staff are acceptable;\nI 'll print some good ones next\nweek and the' winners in the\nChristmas FELIX on December\n14.\nWHAT CAN ONE say about\nthe new Deputy President John McCallion? Friendly and helpful,\nif a little taciturn, he seems to be\ntaking his job with welcome seriousness and doing it calmly\nand efficiently with half the fuss\nthat other members of the Exec\nseem to need. In fact, apart from\nhis mysterious credit in the RCS Handbook as John 'Yellowlines'\nMcCallion, he seemed a singularly fruitless source of material\nfor this column; that is, he did until last Monday's Council. Simon Rodan, like his predecessor as External Affairs Officer, J Martin Taylor, is a great one for using procedural\nwrangles to get his own way, and\nduring the meeting had cause to\nchallenge chairman Nick Pyne's ruling. Nick handed the chair to\nJohn McCallion, who plainly\nhad no idea what was expected\nof him, and consequently chaired\nthe meeting (quite efficiently)\nby pausing every few seconds and\nasking Nick Pyne what he had to\ndo next.\nDRAM SOC's production of Butley last week was set in an\nappallingly untidy office, with\nwastepaper everywhere. The play ran for two nights, and on\nthe morning between them the\ncleaners got to the set and tidied\nit up.\nI Page5\n\n"

    "content": "Stephen King hams it up as Jordy Verrill.\nDespite its faults, George Romero's Creepshow (AA, ABC Fulham Road, Shaftesbury\nAvenue, Classic Haymarket) may prove to be\nthe surprise hit of the year. With a screenplay\nby top horror author Stephen King (Carrie,\nThe Shining, etc) and the director of Night of\nthe Living Dead, it boasts an impressive pedigree and turns out to be an outrageous\nblend of horror and comedy.\nStructured as a series of comic book episodes, Creepshow is a fond tribute to the\nmarvellously over-the-top stories produced by\nEC Comics. When a young boy's father\nthrows his new Creepshow Comic away, a spectral host appears to guide us through five\nepisodes, each introduced by the turning of a new page. As the drawings melt into live action\nthe comic book style is maintained by the use\nof vivid colours and exaggerated motions.\nThe stories are populated by a set of\nunusual, larger than life characters; in Father's Day dotty old Aunt Bedelia returns to the\ngrave of her murdered father (as she does\nevery year on that date). But he has ideas for a celebration of his own...This is followed by The\nLonesome Death of Jordy Verrill in which\nauthor King plays a wonderfully overdone\nbum kin who finds a meteorite in his\ngarden\u2014but is it the solution to all his financial\ntroubles?\nMy favourite piece, for the audacious title\nabove all, was The Crate starring Hal Holbrook as a timid husband contemplating\nthe murder of his loud wife ( played by Adrienne Barbeau with suitable abandon).\nWhen a nosy janitor finds an old abandoned\ncrate in the local university, he unwittingly\nunlocks a creature with awesome teeth and an\nunusually strong desire to return to his former\nsolitude. Put them together and the mayhem\nhas to start soon!\nEasy Meat\nWell, it's back to the fifties again this week for\nanother look at the American youth culture of\nthe time. Director Barry Levinson has\ndiscovered a new hang out for his 'in' crowd: at\nthe local all night Diner, which is now playing\nat the Empire Leicester Square and the ABC Fulham Road.\nThe central characters are five men in their\nearly twenties who have lost all desire to grow\nup, and are content to live out their lives\nspending their time at the Diner, where\nattractions include eating what look like\nMooney chips in gravy or watching a man built\nalong the lines of a supertanker, eating his way\nthrough half of the menu, to the accompaniment of piped music of the Johnny Mathis/\nFrank Sinatra variety.\nExcitement indeed, only matched by the\nscintillating conversation, mainly concerned\nwith girls and music. The talk about music\nreveals that even in 1959, the crooners still\nheld the interest of this age group, and it was\nconsidered rather rakish to prefer rock-n roll.\nIn a world still to hear the word feminism,\ngirls have one object: tame their man tie him to\nthe home. The knack is to enjoy playing with\nyour matches, but not to get burned. The guys\ntalk about their mixed up feelings towards the\nfair sex, in a way they only feel they can with\nthe lads down at the diner, as they try to\nreconcile the easy undemanding friendship of\ntheir peers to the complex world of love and\nsex.\nPage 1 2 nHM HB nH The last two stories are Something To Tide\nYou Over and the exceedingly creepy They're\nCreeping Up On You, which may turn you into\na trembling heap next time you see a cockroach.\nOverall the film is entertaining and at times\nvery funny indeed. Despite claims that you will\nleave the cinema terrified, it is not this element\nwhich stands out. There is little time to build\nany of the stories into anything truly frightening (as with many other episodic films),\nand you come to expect the shocks, knowing\neach piece can only last so long. Romero\nseems to have accounted for this quite well,\nbut his timing was noticeably off here and\nthere.\nHorror aside, the comic book and comedy\nelements are left to shine alone\u2014and they do.\n'Diner' Mooney's with piped music!\nThis rather downbeat film is enlivened by\nthe active script of Mr Levinson who draws his\ncharacters with insight and great affection.\nThe diner is their retreat from the real world\nwith its beckoning responsibilities of careers\nand families. For people who don't have an\ninstitution like university to insulate them and\npostpone the growing up process, the Diner is\na good substitute.\nIt is a visually appealing film with huge old\nAmerican cars trundling about mingled with\ngarish neon and washed out shots of desolate\nindustrialised landscapes at dawn as our\nheroes finish another night of mutual examination and make their way home.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 November 26, 1982 M The use of comic book frames is effective, but\nthe marvellously hammed up characters and\nunusual lighting alone create a hugely\nenjoyable 'comic book feel' which any fan will\nappreciate. This makes for a very funny film,\nwhich just about manages to tread the fine line\nbetween homage and satire successfully.\nOn reflection some of the Corman 'Poe'\nfilms, which must have been an influence on\nRomero, may be more satisfying (will BBC2 include The Raven in their Boris Karloff\nseason I plead?), but Creepshou; comes as a welcome break from the truly horrific spate\nof 'slash the screaming teenager' movies of\nrecent years. It deserves to do very well and\ncan be thoroughly recommended under the\ncategory 'good clean fun'.\nMark Smith\nRather more uptempo, just opened at the\nPlaza is Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, written\nand directed by Carl Reiner, who, in true\nHitchcock style, also makes a brief personal\nappearance. This film is a tribute to the\nthrillers of the 40s and 50s. If Diner was big on\ncharacter but short on action, this film sets off\nat a gallop from the very start, and by the end\nof the first reel we are inextricably entangled in\nthis spoof film noir plot and waist deep in red\nherrings, as the action comes as fast as the\nwisecracks.\nOur latter day Marlowe, Rigby Reardon, is\ntrying to emulate his hero. A suspicious death,\na hit list and bodies falling thick and fast, but\nour hero struggles on with just a few bullet\nwounds and a cut lip; underneath it all, of\ncourse, is a madman intent on world domination. More Fleming than Marlowe?\nWell the r in lies the rub. This is updated\nMarlowe where greater things are at stake\nthan the ruin of the odd small time gangster.\nOur hero also commits the heinous crime of\nfalling for his (female) client, squeezing\ntoothpaste over her shoes and talking about\npyjamas. This temporal warp is emphasised by\nusing clips from the original films, cut in, some\ntimes cleverly out of context, to the new\nmaterial. This is done by various means. The\nstandard method of the time for filming a dramatic scene with a close-up of the star's face filmed over the shoulder of the co-star\nwho is out of focus is exploited, replacing one\nof the protagonists to produce curious results,\nincluding Rigby serenading Gary Grant with\nhis harmonica and the hopping into Grant's IIII\u2022 MlIIIIIIWIHI1M\u2014\u2022IIMIII\u2014ll ll III III H W11II I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rag Mag\nGrumbles\nSir\nMay I, through the pages of\nFELIX, protest at the offensiveness of this year's Rag Mag,a copy of which I was unfortunate\nenough to recently acquire. The\nmajority of the so-called 'jokes'\nI found, as a Christian, both\nvulgar and re'pul sive \u2014especially\nthose concerned with racism. I feel that it is a sad reflection on\nthe state of our society when\nsome people can consider the\nsort of material contained within\nthe Rag Mag as funny \u2014\nthankfully, some of us still find\nthis sort of' humour' totally obnoxious. Having sampled some of the 'student humour at\nits irreverent best', I read the\neditorial which added insult to\ninjury, and made sure in my\nmind that I should voice my disgust. Just because some of us\nhave morals and ethics somewhat\ndifferent to those of Mr Crawford, does not give him justification to refer to us as 'narrow-minded' and 'shit filled', and it\ndoes not follow that we lead\n'humour less, crapped-up lives'.\nI would also like to point out\nthat the Rag Mag is one of our\ncontacts with outside world, and\nis thus taken by others as\nrepresentative of the College( even though it is not a fair\nrepresentation of the whole College). I, for one, am quite\nashamed that the College of which I am a member produces\nand sells such a disgraceful publication \u2014 especially under\nsuch a misleading title. (I have\nheard of an instance where a mother bought a copy for her\nyoung child because of the\n'Janet and John' title.)\nFinally, I would like to ask\nwhether or not the fact that\nsomething makes money for charity means that the thing itself is necessarily right?\nI hope very much that you\nprint this letter, and I hope that\nPage4 HH HM HH HM i it provokes others, both Christians and non-Christians,\nwith feelings similar to mine, to\nvoice their opinions.\nYours\nAMC Prowse\nMe chEng1 News Bias\u2014\nRound 3\nDear Sir\nIam sorry if I upset your reporter, Adrian James, with my\nletter the other week; from the\ntone of his reply, he seems rather\ndistressed! (If he would care to\nread my original letter, he might\nthen be able to answer my actual\ncriticism, rather than ascribe views to me that Ido not possess. S' funny how many people assume that those who\nask for fair and un misleading reporting actually want biased\nreporting\u2014I assume this to be a symptom of their closed minds.\nBut I digress.)\nAdrian James' letter was, like\nhis original' news' article perhaps, not entirely un mis leading, so perhaps I may be\npermitted to 'worry' the word 'betray' a little further.\nSurely Mr James does not\nneed me to point out that although one of the ten usages of\nthe word 'betray' given by his\ndictionary is indeed \"to indicate\nor show signs of, the other\nmore common usages all suggest\neither inadvertence or some dishonour able motive. When the\nword is used in the sense he\nintended, the effect can be\nambiguous, as noted in Eric Partridge's excellent Usage and\nAbusage. 'Betray' is, I would suggest, more usually applied in\nthe sense intended to inanimate\nobjects, where there is less scope\nfor ambiguity!( Incidentally, Webster also notes its use for \" to show or indicate\"\u2014but adds,\n\"(as something not obvious on\nthe surface)\". Give or take the\nodd pinstripe suit, I have always\nfound Sir Ashley' s socialist principles highly visible!)\nFinally, I won't make a cheap\nreference to the inevitable printing errors that crept into Mr James' letter, but on the subject\nof spelling, might I request that\nthe next time someone chooses,\nhowever childishly, to spell' Daily Tory graph' and not to\n'correct' it as with my previous\nletter.

While wandering casually around the estate on\nwhich we live I came across two\ncars with valid IC parking permits. \" Rotte rs!\"I thought,\nbut then I realised of course that\nthey must have been down visiting someone from Oxford because we happened to have\noverslept this particular day and\nit was about 10:30am, and as we\nall know anybody who gets\nparking permits would of course\nuse them every day unlike two\nhardworking PG s who never\nwork late or anything like that.\nYours non-forgiving ly R Chapman S Chapman Physics PG s PS: Today I came across a third\ncar and I realise now we should\ntake up praying to Mecca as in\ncertain other permit applications\nmentioned in this newspaper before.\nWe would be obliged if this is\nnot edited too drastically and\npublished in full if possible.\nThankYou Mines Coffee\nDear Martin\nIn response to MAGnus whining s last week I should like\nto bring to his attention the\nfabulous beverage service available on the first floor of the\nMines Building.

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nSOUTHSIDE MOVE: COLLEGE TRIES AGAIN\nThe projected move of Union facilities to Southside is again a real\npossibility after a meeting of the Southside Working Party and\nmembers of the Estates Section on Thursday afternoon. Most Union\nrepresentation seem to approve of the plan as set out by the College, but\nthey will insist on certain safeguards and guarantees before committing\nthe Union.\nThe College proposals as\noutlined by Don Clark of Estates is that over the next four\nyears, all Union facilities should\nmove from Beit Quad to the\nlower levels of Southside, which\nare at present underused. The Post Experience Centre could\nthen be established in Beit. (This\nis a plan to run short courses for\nindustry, and is expected to bring a large amount of money\ninto College.) The move would\nstart with the building of new\nsports facilities, including glass-backed squash courts, a new\ntheatre and, once the Southside\nShop has moved to larger premises, all the Union administration, and offices. No plans to\nmove the FELIX Office have\nbeen put forward.\nUnion officers still have major\nreservations; they consider it\nsuspicious that College should\noffer to undertake so much expenditure on the Union's behalf, and want legal guarantees\nthat the money will be spent as\npromised. They are also querying\nthe claim that it would be more\ncostly to simply build the Post\nExperience Centre in Southside.\nOther questions that they would like answered include the\nprobable life of the Southside\nBuilding ( Don Clark told the\nmeeting that he has an estimate\nof over a hundred years) and the\nnoise problem; residents of the\nMews have been known fo complain of the noise of pool\nballs in Falmouth Keo gh Hall. The matter is long referred to the Union Major Subcommittees, and as soon as a detailed\ncosting has been made there will\nbe a further meeting of the Working Party; it is possible that\nthe matter will get as far as aUG M before Christmas.\nGUILDSHIT HITS THE FAN\nSeveral hundred copies of Guildsheet were replaced by a satirical\nimitation entitled 'Guildshit' on Wednesday morning. For his\ninvolvement in removing the official publications, Union Welfare\nOfficer Jon Barnett has been accused of theft by members of City and\nGuilds Union and by Stephen Goulder, 1CU President.\n'Guildshit' was produced by Wednesday morning when they\nThe mother of Stuart Rockell, who died of Leukaemia four weeks ago,\nlaunched a new four named after Stuart on Morphy Day in the\ntraditional fashion.\nNick Pyne, the U GM Chairman and himself an ex Welfare Officer, in reprisal for a series of\nattacks on himself in several of\nthe year's issues, primarily in the\n'Hissing Sid' column written by\nJon Stanley. Mr Pyne told FELIX that replacing Guildsheet\nwith a parody was the only way\nto make his protest in a forceful\nbut humorous way. The issue\nwas written by Mr Pyne and several close friends, and was\ncopied at his home on his own duplicating machine, except for\nthe cover, which like that of Guildsheet, was printed in the\nUnion Print Unit \u2014 but without\nthe official knowledge of the\nPrint Unit Manager. Dist rib u tion was originally intended for\nlast Thursday, but when it was\nlearned that the next issue of the\nregular newspaper would be on\nMorphy Day, it was re scheduled.\nAccordingly, Mr Barnett and Jon Taylor, a third year Physics\nstudent, were removing Guildsheet from the Electrical Engineering Department early on ran into Frank Row sell, the Guildsheet Editor.\nSteve Bishop and Frank Rowsell then complained to the\nUnion President Stephen Gould er, who sent Mr Barnett\nan official letter saying that he\nconsidered that Guildshit was far\nmore extreme than anything printed in Guildsheet this year,\nand accusing him of intolerance\nand theft. But handwritten at the\nfoot of the letter he had added\n\" PS:I thought the issue was\nhilarious.\"\nNo. 629 Friday, November 26, 1982 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "shoes for that memorable scene with Ingrid\nBergman in Notorious.\nI could be wrong, but I think this is the first\ntime a tribute has been undertaken in this way.\nThe result is a shade i rr ever ant and bears\ncomparison with Woody Allen's tribute to the\nfilm noir world of Bogart in P/ ay It Again Sam.\nIn Allen's film he is worshipping his hero and\n\u2022IREVIEWSI\ntrying to emulate Bogart's sexual image to his\nmundane world. Rigby as the dick-head private\ndick takes to the whole lifestyle and tries to\nintroduce more modern dialogue. The result is\nhumour as Rigby struggles with the oversize\nmantle he has inherited from Marlowe. The\nsuperhuman control we expect, as the nn tries to break through the mask, the emotions\nbetrayed in the narrative rather than the face,\ncontrasted with the transparent Reardon, who\ntakes advantage of Juliet Forest; the rather\nlack-lustre heroine, when she faints into his\narms on their first encounter.\nI unreservedly recommend this film to any\nfan of the tough guy-sleuth genre, or those\nwho enjoy sophisticated humour, which, although occasionally misfiring, normally succeeds in getting a laugh; some of the\nwisecracks are worthy of Marlowe himself.\nLee Paddon\nObnoxia in\nOxonia\n'Dead Man' Reardon foils the vile plot.\nPrivileged, AA, Directed by Michael\nHoffman.\nPrivileged is a film about Oxford under-graduates, and was written, directed, produced and acted primarily by Oxford students. It is rather surprising, therefore, to\ndiscover that technically the film is very good,\nsurpassing many produced on a much larger\nbudget by far more experienced film-makers.\nAs a piece of entertainment, though, it is\nrather disappointing; the plot fails to live up to\nthe standard of the other ingredients of the\nfilm.\nThe story concerns Edward, an Oxford\nundergraduate who is a gifted actor, a woman is er, and a thoroughly nasty piece of\nwork. The film follows his relationship with\nAnn,a fellow student. Ann and Edward, and\nindeed most of the other main characters, are\ninvolved in the University Dramatic Society's production of The Duchess of Malfi. Parts of\nthis play are seen in rehearsal and performance\nduring the course of the film, and one is left\nwith a nagging feeling that some of the action\nin the play might parallel in some way the story\nunfolding around it. If this is the case, however,\nit is never really made clear enough; if it isn't, too much attention is focused on the play.\nThe problem with presenting a love story\nsuch as this is that, because neither of the\nmain protagonists evoke any sympathy, there\nis no great feeling of involvement with the plot.\nThe makers claim that the film gives an\naccurate account of contemporary undergraduate life at Oxford. If this is so, then the\nsuspicions of many IC students are indeed\ncorrect\u2014Oxford students are a bunch of\narrogant obnoxious bastards. There are only\nthree likable characters in the film, and all\nthree of them get stamped on in one way or\nanother. Jamie and Lord Adrian both suffer\nfrom Edward's treatment of the two women\nthey respectively love, and Imogen, a friend of\nAnn's, is assaulted in an incident which seems\nto have only a coincidental connection with the\nmain plot.\nDespite the deficiencies in storyline, though,\nit must be said again that this is a well made\nand well acted film, and it is to be hoped that\nthe people involved will go on to greater things.\nDave Jago\nBlancmange\nsounding\nHungry\nMuch to the chagrin of the Musician's Union,\nthe dreaded synthesis er has gained in\npopularity over the last year and a bit, due\nlargely to Soft Cell's superbly sparse Tainted\nLove/Where Did Our Love Go, and the\nre juv in a ted Human League. The latter producing a string of dance floor hits pepped\nup by producer Martin Rushen' s Linn Computer drums (replacing the rather weedy\nrhythm boxes of old with some much-needed\nmuscle). Now, hardly a week goes by without\nyet another electropop band on Top of the\nPops. Compared to the economy of an\n'isolation' or a 'temptation', the razor-sharp\narrangements of 'New Life' or a 'Don't Go', the\nlikes of Thomas Dolby, Tears for Fears, China\nCrisis (and even Soft Cell of late), leave much\nto be desired with new tunes that are finicky\nand weak; too much sugar-coating on a soft\ncentre. So it's refreshing to listen to Happy\nFamilies (London) by Blancmange who at least\nsound hungry as opposed to well-fed and\nbloated. It contains their current success\n'Living on the Ceiling', the third in a run of fine\nsingles, all of which you'll find here. I hope they\nget around to releasing the abrasive instrumentals they wrote for Micha Bergese's dance group 'Mantis'. The Passage augment\ntheir electronics with guitar, and a flesh and\nblood drummer, their new album Degenerates\n(Cherry Red) finds them further refining their\nhighly original sound with songs that range\nfrom the gay abandon of 'Xoyo' to the uneasy\npeace of 'Love Is As'. More than enough for\nthe converted, but unlikely to win new fans.\nThe live Passage is a different beast altogether\nas they showed at IC recently; a formidable\nbarrage of rhythm and electronics, spiced with\nDick Witts' lyrical attacks on government and\nchurch, displaying a naked power only hinted\nat on vinyl, (their encore of 'Lost In Music' is\nthe alter ego of the associates' Love Hangover'). Dip into their singles selection,\nespecially the recent 'Xoyo' as\" which boasts a superior version of 'Born Every Minute', that is\ntruly 'Dancing Through Dark Times'.\nSince 'Don't You Want Me', released at the\nend of 1981, the Human League haven't made\na noise until the current hit 'Mirror Man'. No\nradical departure from formula. Without Phil\nand Suzanne crooning at each other, the\nnation switched its attention to David and\nTheresa\u2014Dollar. I was going to suggest that\nyou buy someone 'The Dollar Album' (WEA)\nfor Christmas so you could tape the excellent\nstring of Trevor Horn-produced singles that\nranged from 'Hand Held in Black and White' to\n'Videotheque'. Don't! \u2014Buy the singles instead\nas the dip py duo have produced a number of\nself-penned turkeys, and re-mixed the hits with\ndire consequences. 'Give me Back my Heart'\nsuffers from heavy-handedness, and under\nDollar's hands falls on the wrong side of\noverproduction, and anyway, 'Mirror Mirror',\nwith its Kraftwerk-like acknowledgment of\nspace and minimalism, remains the finest\nelectropop of the year.\nThree recent re-releases at around \u00a33; CBS have The Clash's first album out again, whilst\nEMI come up with 'Searching for the Young\nSoul Rebels', the Dexys Mk1 Stax/Motown\nhomage. 'Fourth Drawer Down'( Situation 2)\nby The Associates is currently gracing the\nracks at the HMV Shop in Oxford Street, and\nas this essential selection of pre-'Suck' singles\nwas previously only available as a pricey\nGerman import, it's well worth snapping up.\nSimple Minds have come on in leaps and\nbounds since their watered-down magazine\ndays, and as the third single to be lifted from\n'New Gold Dream' (Virgin), slips into the\n' Fabulous Fun Forty', cast an ear to the\nalbum\u2014more luxurious, seamless, sinewy pop\nfrom the 'Sons and Fascination' stable. Also on\nVirgin, Culture Club's 'Kissing to be Clever',\nyet another greatest hits for a debut, you'll find\ntheir recent single hit here, plus the superlative\n'White Boy', and 'I'm Afraid of Me' singles too.\nAt times Boy George's harmonies rival the\nJacksons\u2014no mean feat! From the sweetest\nboy to 'The Sweetest Girl', the oldest and still\nthe finest track on Scritti Politti's 'Songs To\nRemember' (Rough Trade). Svengali Green\nparades his gospel/funk/swing influences for\nall to see, but this adds up to much more than\nmere pl agar is m. Check the winsome 'Jacques\nPerida'; a new era of late light music? Apart\nfrom a new, rambling 'Lions After Slumber'\nand the oddly truncated7\" version of\n'Faithless', an album to sav our. To pointless singles: The Higsons' 'Tear the\nWhole Thing Down' on Two-Tone, is too\ntinny, and not enough funky, and quite why a Certain Ratio should record a new version of\n'Knife Slits Water' (Factory) as dull and lifeless\nas this is beyond me. Instead, a quick plug for\ntheir colourful 'sextet' album which ranges\nfrom the usual abstract funk on 'Below the\nCanal' to the mock Latin frivolity of\n'Skipscada, everything pivoting around the\noriginal tense and uneasy version of 'Knife'.\nLastly, the biggest delight of the week was\nhearing the new album from Siouxsie and\nBandshees called ' A Kiss in the Dreamhouse'\n(Polydor) this is their best yet. Whilst 'Ju-ju'\nproduced a couple of excellent singles in\n'Spellbound' and 'Arabian Nights', and boasted\nthe excellent guitar ing of John M cGe och, the\nstructure of the songs was essentially the usual\nBanshees whirlpool of gothic horror and\nchildhood nightmares. 'Cascades' the opening\ntrack sets the tone; a nod to the past, but also\na vanguard for the new style, less claustrophobic than of old, with pan pipes and mardi\ngras alongside Severin's insistent bass lines\nand McGeogh'sch img in guitar.

We couldn't agree on an order for\nthe five, so we thought we'd better win before the need arose.\nIC started in para ly sing(?) form, but the usual catalogue of misses built up. Finally...success.\nStephenson sliding in Rickard's free kick, and then latching on to\nMcG uck in' s quick free kick to\nmake it two.

    "content": "A Degree of\nIgnorance\nHoroscopes, UFOs and ghosts\nwere among the fallacies attacked\nby Dr Magnus Pyke under the\nheading ' A Budget of Fallacies'\nlast Monday. Dr Pyke has spent\nthe last ten years trying to tell his\nfellow citizens what science is all\nabout. He is still trying and spent some time extolling the\nvirtues of hard science and the\nscientific method: \" I have been\nvery much disturbed and upset\nby the degree of ignorance generally prevalent about the\nworld we live in.\" People have\nno understanding of the science\nthat affects their lives, he says.\n\" Outside these walls,\" Dr Pyke\ncried, one of his famous arm waves encompassing the entire\nCollege, \"they are savages!\" He praised the achievements of science in general and with a particular bias towards chemistry and biology speaking of\nmiracles from rational means,\nslipping in numerous jokes at the\nexpense of the engineers and\nmathematicians. He then turned\nto the fallacies and pseudo science \"the poison of un reason\" that still persists: 30 to 40 million\nAmericans believe deeply in astrology. Dr Pyke then ran through all the popular fallacies,\nreferring to spoon bending, the\nBermuda Triangle, dowsing and\nhomeopathy with a final war ning note on witch burning and\nnazism; the master race fallacy.\nDr Pyke appealed to all science\nstudents to help dispel the\nfallacies because of the real danger of the ignorance they\nindicate.\nA rare photograph of Magnus Pyke using only one hand!\nMorphy\nMuck-Up\nThe Morphy Oar was broken on\nWednesday during the annual\ntowpath battle. City and Guilds\nnow possess one third of the\ntrophy and Mines hold the rest.\nThe Morphy Day battle itself\ndid not start until dusk, with\nvarious revolting substances\nbeing hurled at everyone in sight. This year's predominant\ningredient was fish gut, but after\nthe R CSU fire engine Jez had\nhosed down the towpath there\nwas more left on the participants\nthan on the ground. Comparatively few people were allowed\ninto Harrods for tea afterwards.\nIn the more serious rowing\ncompetition, City and Guilds won the Morphy and Lowry eights, and a team from R CSU won the ladies' race.\nwho was busy at the National Conference. Since Mr Howard was delayed, the talk was preceded by an informal debate\nbetween Philip Nathan( IC Liberals) and Paul Simi on( P WP) on the NUS issue.\nIC 'Armless'\nIC is cutting off its own arms,\naccording to Frank Howard, NUS Exec Member, when questioned about ICU's re-affiliation\nto NUS. Mr Howard said that\nNUS would be even stronger and\nable to negotiate better deals for\nstudents by having ICU among\nits members. This would be\nespecially true for issues such as\nthe rational is ation of London University and the various mergers involved.\nMr Howard was addressing a meeting on Tuesday replacing\nNUS Vice-President Jane Taylor Frank Howard\nMr Howard challenged Mr Simion's claim that NUS works\non \"totally unrealistic grounds\"\nand said that, although NUS is\nradical, not all its members are\nstereotyped activists. He also\ndenied that NUS's bureaucracy\nis larger than needed or that its\nways are undemocratic and said\nthat, although it has made mistakes in the past, it is the sole\norganisation to represent our\ninterests.\nFELIXI\nRacial\nDiscrimination\nStudent Services' decision to\npractise positive discrimination\nwhen allocating places in Hall to\npostgraduates next year has\ncaused concern among people\nwho feel there will be no room\nfor British PG s in Hall. The\nStudent Services Officer Michael H HMM V'H Hl November 26, 1982\nArthur explained the situation to\nFELIX: The first group on the ladder\nof priorities will be overseas\npostgraduate fresher s, who will\nall have one guaranteed year in a single room in an Imperial College or Intercollegiate Hall. The next priority will be given to\nfirst year postgraduates who have not studied at IC before.\nMSc students will be given priority over PhD students and\nfemale students will have priority\nover male.\nThe justification for these\ndecisions is that firstly overseas\nstudents have to pay full tuition\nfees and so they should be\nallowed the financial relief of\nliving in Hall, which is usually\ncheaper than living outside. Students who pay full fees are\nmuch sought after by the College\nand are likely to be influenced by\nthe availability of accommodation. Also, students who have\nnever lived in Britain before have a great need of guaranteed\nhousing. Secondly MSc students\nhave an intensive, timetabled\none-year course and have little\nopportunity to look for housing\nwhile PhD students have a more\nflexible course and can take time\noff. Finally, female students\nmight be worried about living on\ntheir own in London, and because there are so few women\nstudents the College tries to\nencourage female applicants.\nMichael Arthur put these\nproposals to a recent meeting of\nthe Student Residence Commit tee, and they were approved in\nprinciple. The scheme will probably be implemented for\nnext year's admissions.\nBar Accounts\nOpen\nBob Schroter, Chairman of the\nRefectories Committee, has\noffered to open the Ba r accounts\nto the members of the Ba r Subcommittee only. His proposal\nwas revealed to Council on Monday evening. The scheme\nwas agreed to and has been\nreferred to the next U GM for\napproval. But Dr Sch roter dismissed as ' ridiculous' rumours that the Rector himself\nhad ordered him to do this.\nSexism\nProtest\nA lone Imperial College student\nwas the only protester outside\nthe Albert Hall last Thursday\nevening. Michael Newman appeared with his banner, reading ' Down with the Stereotype Female/ Male', just as the\nrich connoisseurs of the Miss\nWorld competition were leaving.\nSome interest was shown in his\nbanner, but the main comments\nwere advising him not to get too\ncold.\nAfter a small protest march\nin front of the Albert Hall Mr Newman sat down opposite the\nhall and was joined by a friendly\npoliceman. The two chatted amicably, both of them explaining to enquire rs the meaning of\nthe slogan.\nThere was an unusually large\npolice contingent for the competition this year as a group of\nFalklands' Heroes had been\ninvited. Due to high media attention it was feared that they\nmight be a target for terrorists.\nHH HP HH HB HH Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "U GM:A BORED GAME FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES1. There should be at least 300 participants. A shorter version\ninvolving fewer people is available and is called 'Quorum\nCaller'.\n2. The players elect a Chairman who puts on a pink\nturban/red nose/false beard/wooden leg or similar and starts the\ngame with the words \"I open this UGM at six minutes past one\".\n3. A speaker is chosen at the Chairman's discretion. (The\nChairman's discretion is, of course, legendary-that is, totally\nmythical.)\n4. The speaker must talk for two minutes on any subject\nwithout repetition, hesitation, deviation, punctuation or\nmentioning the NUS.\n5. The remaining players should attempt to put him off by\nbooing, hissing, shouting and suggesting procedural motions.\n6. Players may also interrupt by attempting to 'submit\ninformation' out of turn. When this happens, the Chairman\nshouts, 'Shut up Stephen!' and scores a point.\n7. Politics may only be introduced when no-one can think of\nmotions. Like mathematics, politics is merely a substitute for\nthought. Suitable games for quasi-political boring hacks are\n'University of London Union', 'NUS' and 'Euthanasia'.\n8. The Chairman always wins because only he really\nunderstands what is going on. The person who has won most\ngames at the end of the year is elected Union President and must\nshave off his beard for charity.\nThe Union General Meeting is\nthe policy-making body of ICU. Campus-wide elections, ballots,\nmanifestos and referenda are\nmerely a hangover from democratic idealism, and should be\nabolished altogether. To justify\nthis rather dramatic piece of\nanarchy, a cera in amount of boring background is necessary.\nDemocracy is the rule of the\npeople, for the people, by the\npeople\u2014one person, one vote,\nand if that sounds like a recipe\nfor the ultimate committee meeting, that is exactly what it\nis. It was even invented by a committee \u2014 and in Greek at\nthat. In fact, Ancient Greece and\nRome were the first attempted\ndemocratic states, and the fact\nthat both collapsed (through bad\ngovernment) rather a long time\nago does not alter the fact that\nwe still worship their ideas of\ndemocracy without really understanding them.\nThis ideal is absolutely impractical, so what happens is\nthat the actual business of ruling\nis carried out by a group of\npeople elected by universal suffrage. This ruling body does\nthe work for you, and if you don't like the results you elect\nsomeone else the next time round. At this point the system begins\nto fall apart. Firstly, your representatives spend more time\ntrying to get re-elected than they\ndo actually governing. Secondly,\nthe whole business became so\nspecialised that the only people\nwho really know what is happening are those in government. At this point, the idea of a referendum on( for example) whether to\nleave the EEC becomes pointless,\nbecause the decision is then\ntaken by fifty million people\nwho have not the slightest idea\nof what they are voting about,\nexcept what they pick up from the\ntelevision and newspapers, which are not necessarily unbiased \u2014in fact, political broadcasts and publicity ensure that\nthis is so.\nThis is roughly what is happening at Imperial; Union officers are elected by guesswork\nor by default (any semi-literate\nhack could be Publicity Officer\nby now if he had stood for the\npost). Sabbaticals are not elected\nby the people who have worked\nwith them and know their capabilities, but by an electorate\nthat will only have a photograph\nand a page of publicity from\nwhich to judge.\nLast year's presidential election was a case in point. At the\nfirst stage, Stephen Gould er was\nonly a handful of votes ahead of\nBob Holding, who stood as a' joke candidate' and would probably have been the worst\nPresident since...(insert name as\nreader thinks fit). In fact, if he\nhad had a few more supporters,\nhe might have been in the embarrassing position of occupying a post that he did not really\nwant, having been chosen by a random candidate-selection process which favours (in order of importance), humour, original\npublicity, good legs, ability to\nridicule people at UG Ms and in\nthe FELIX letters pages and the\nconviction with which refectory\n.boycotts are promised.\nAs an additional problem (I quote unashamedly) it is a well-known fact that the last pes on who should be given power is the\none who wants it so badly that\nhe will start his campaign a term\nin advance. (Question: who is\ncarrying out a Nick Pyne defamation campaign in prep a ration for the presidential election? Answers on a plain\npostcard to Jon Stanley, c/o Guildsheet, C& GU). Abolish Elections\nThe idea of a referendum is\neven more ludicrous \u2014 that if there is something so important\nthat no-one can reach a decision,\nit should be decided by five\nthousand people who have not\nthe faintest idea what the consequences of their decision\nwill be. As an obvious example,\ndo you really know more about\nthe NUS than you have read in\nthe newspaper articles or talked\nabout in bars? If not, than you are probably in no position to\nvote in any future referendum on\nthe subject.\nThe logical conclusion is that\nthat all vital Union business\nshould be carried out by aUG M. College wide elections and referenda should be abo-li shed, so that at least voters\nwould have a chance of hearing\npeople who know what they are\ntalking about before casting the\nvotes. If you cannot be bothered\nto turn up to aUG M, you probably should not be allowed\nnear a ballot-box anyway. At least the majority of those who attend are( comparatively) responsible\u2014I was pleasantly\nsurprised when at the last( obviously in quo rate) meeting\nthe Quorum Caller Extraodinary\nwaited until after an important\nbut boring motion on the Bar Subcommittee before doing his\nbit.\nI expect at least a dozen shocked letters accusing me of\nbeing an anarchist, communist\nor merely raving lunatic for attempting to remove the ' k' from Democracy (think about\nit). To forestall a few arguments,\nI shall close with the faults that I have been able to think of in this\nsystem.\nSolutions, comments, critic-isms, men in white coats to me at\nthe FELIX Office, Wednesday\n1:00pm. The first fault is that people\nwho cannot get to UG Ms because of prior commitments\n(or just a desire to eat lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays) lose\ntheir only previous say in Union affairs. The second is that not all\ncompetent sabbatical candidates\nare eloquent speakers\u2014it is easy\nto vote for an impressive piece of\noratory by a potentially bad Union officer. Thirdly, we could\nend up with far too many people\nat UG Ms \u2014 the Great Hall has\nlimited capacity. However, there\nis no rule that UG Ms must be\nheld in the Great Hall \u2014 one could apparently be held in the\nLadies' Toilets in Beit Hall. You could throw some good parties\nthat way.\nNext week: Bring a bottle Council meetings.\nAdrian James\nPage81 November 26, 1982 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ability to do their jobs well, their\npolitical composition is hardly a recipe for moderation.\nThe Membership of NUS One of the NUS's proud boasts\nis its slogan; ' NUS, one million\nmembers, one movement'. Apart\nfrom the obvious fact that the\nidea of all students standing shoulder to shoulder behind the\nNUS's policies is quite ridiculous, one of its weaknesses is its\nvery diverse membership. Members of NUS range from sixteen\nyear olds re sitting O Levels to\nmature PG students who are\nmarried with two kids and a mortgage, and just about everyone else in between. There have\neven been suggestions of admitting the unemployed to NUS membership. The many different\ntypes of student in NUS have\nlittle or nothing in common,\nwhich makes the 'one move-ment' claim look a bit hollow.\nUniversity students do have\nsomething in common, but they\nare just a minority in the NUS. In order to bolster its membership figures still further NUS is now trying to recruit from\nsixth forms in secondary schools,\nalthough already it has been\nbanned by at least one education\nauthority.\nMany colleges and universities\nhave left the NUS or are considering doing so. Often apathy\nis the only reason they remain\naffiliated. ICU has received several enquiries over the past\nfew years from other student\nunions abut how we survive outside NUS. Presently most\nScottish universities, many Oxbridge colleges and Kings College, London are major institutions outside NUS. It is only one year since the\nNUS issue was last debated at\nIC, when it was also raised by\nthe same group of people. At that time despite the presence of\nthe NUS President at the U GM and other NUS hacks in the\npreceeding weeks the motion\nsupporting re affiliation was\noverwhelmingly defeated. The\nNUS President left IC in no\ndoubt about what students here\nthink about NUS. Even to hold a referendum\nwould cost about \u00a3300. Make sure that even this money is not\nwasted by turning up at the\nU GM on December 7 to vote\ndown any motion calling for a referendum.\nJ Martin Taylor\nExternal Affairs Officer 1981/2\nPaul Simion\nExternal Affairs Committee and\nPWP Member\nI MEViT>&-\u00a3.
