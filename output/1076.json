    "content": "10 FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 2 4 TH JANUARY\nA Bunch of Poofters\nby IQ's Karen Yates\nA recent survey showed that 80% of\nhomophobic men were turned on by\nan erotic video of two men together.\nSo, are they really homophobic, or\njust afraid of their own sexuality?\nIt has been suggested that Imperial is\na bad place to be gay. However, this\nattitude is closer to an outdated\nstereotype than the truth. There is\nhomophobia here (as there is every-where), but it does seem to have\ndecreased from what it once was.\nEven last year, as soon as any IQ\nposter went up, it was torn down, it\nwas almost a race between the\nposter er and the bigot to see who\ncould get to the end of the walkway\nfirst! This year our posters have\nremained up longer although this is\nnot a plea to the first homophobic\ntw at to start removing our posters\nagain! Blatant homophobia is now\nfrowned upon, so insults have now\nbecome more underhand and bitchy.\nHomophobia can take many\nOne step forward, two steps back Gays, lesbians and bisexuals have\nbeen around for a long time and, in a sense, we have moved backwards in\nour behaviour towards them.\nIn 2500BCa married couple were\nburied in Egypt. The only difference\nbetween this tomb and any other\ntomb of a married couple was that\nboth the people in this tomb were\nmale. There is also evidence that in\nthe past the Roman Catholic and\nEastern Orthodox churches sanctioned and even sanctified unions\nlike marriage between members of\nthe same sex.\nIt is only relatively recently that\nproblems have occurred, the proposed change in the law in Hawaii\nallowing same-sex marriage resulting in a right-wing blackmail campaign against the state.\nDiscrimination against homosexuals and bisexuals is allowed by law.\nThere is no law that states that\nemployers should not not employ\nsomebody because of their sexuality\nas there is with sex or race. It is up to\nforms, from indirect comments\nbehind the back to direct \"queer\nbashing\". A person coming out can\ndestroy their employment op port uni ties, have their family turn against\nthem and be subject to mental and\nphysical abuse.\nIn the USA, gay adolescents are two or three times\nmore likely to commit suicide than their heterosexual\npeers.\nSlightly closer to home, aUL U student in an intercollegiate hall was\nforced to move out because people\nstopped talking to him and everytime\nhe went to the bathroom, everyone\nwalked out. Last term IQ received a piece of hate mail through the post.\nThe content of the message said\nindividual employers to decide on\ntheir equal opportunities policy on\nthis issue. An equal opportunities\npolicy, such as IC's, that only takes\n\"appropriate provisions in relation to\nage, disability and sexual preferences\nsomething to the effect of \"Hello you\ndirty maggots\". It was sent to every\nUL Ul gb society.\nSome people are homophobic due\nto the fact that they have a low self\nesteem, they need to find a minority\ngroup that they feel superior to.\nStereotypes are formed of the people\nwithin these minorities. In this way\ngay men are t arty, camp and should\nbe doing art, therefore, there should\nbe none here. Lesbians should be\nshaven headed mechanics with attitude problems. These stereotypes are\ningrained into people's consciousness to the extent that young gay\npeople can assume all other lg b's are\nlike this and become frightened that\nthey are not, and so stay closeted.\nHowever, as more people come out,\nthey realise these are just stereotypes\nand that they have no need to live up\nto (or indeed down to) this media\ninduced image.\nSo far, I think I have implied that\nhomo ph obes and bi ph obes are largely ignorant and straight - however,\nthere is another group equally as\nlikely to be bi phobic as the he t ero within the law\" should, in time be\nimproved so that it is made clear that\nthe best person for the job gets the\njob regardless of who they are.\nOne step at a time brings us closer\nto a fair and equal system....\nsexual community. To some, in this\ngroup, bisexuals are traitors to the\ncause, people who haven't made up\ntheir minds to be gay because they\nare too keen on keeping their \"het-ero sexual privilege\". On this issue,\nthe gay community are as guilty as\ntheir heterosexual counterparts.\nBisexuals, in no way gain a heterosexual privilege, closeted gays and\nbis do, but once a bisexual is out,\nthey are subject to queer bashing,\ntaunts, loss of job, loss of family....\nsound familiar so far? Far from having \"the best of both worlds\", bisexuals are subject to suspicion by both\nthe gay and straight communities.\nAccording to a survey by\nthe University of\nCalifornia, those least likely to be homophobic are:\n* politically liberal\n* young\n* highly educated\n* female\n* know a Igb person\nIQ is here for you Although this article may seem at\nfirst to be depressing we have come\na long way towards eradicating\nhomophobia and bi phobia. IQ could not have existed just a few years ago. It is important to\nnote that the majority of people are\nvery open minded and, frankly, do\nnot care what you are as long as you\nare happy. There is however still a lot of work to be done until we reach\nthe point where a homo/bisexual can\ncome out to their parents without\nfear, perhaps, eventually there will\nbe no need to even come out.\nIQ is a friendly group where gays,\nlesbians and bisexuals can meet. IQ\nmeets every Tuesday at 7.30 in the\nBrown Committee Room. We can\nbe contacted via the pigeon holes in\nthe union office or by e mail to\nka.yates@ic.ac.uk or s.r. cook@\nic.ac.uk\nContact Numbers:\nNational Lesbian and Gay\nSwitchboard (0171) 837 7324\nNational Bisexual Helpline (0181)\n569 7500 10.30am12.30 pm Many of the arguments against gays, lesbians and bisexuals can be easily\ncountered, I have listed some of the most common ones:\n1) Sex with members of the same sex is unnatural.\nAbout 80% of the world's population are heterosexual, therefore to them,\nyes, same sex relations are unnatural. However, equally unnatural is a sexual relationship with a member of the opposite sex for a gay person.\n2) Homosexuals recruit young people\nAlmost all heterosexuals do not abuse children - the same is true for gay\npeople. My aunt used to think that all gay people were pae d ophile s, then she\nfound out about me... She has since decided that although I am not a pae-d ophile so her original idea was wrong, I must fit into the stereotypes, coming out as lesbian to your aunt is a good way to avoid gro tty perfume for\nChristmas!\n3) The Bible condemns same sex relations.\nThe original Hebrew scriptures seem only to condemn homosexual rape\nand both heterosexual and homosexual prostitution. It says nothing of homosexual feeling. The writings of St Paul are believed to be mainly personal\nopinion as he also condemned women even speaking in church. Many\nchurches teach that people should love the homosexual but hate homosexuality, unfortunately some people end up hating both.\n\n"

He did accept that he\nwasn'ta fire officer, however.\nQuestioning went on for about an\nhour, until the warden decided that\nno further progress would be made\nthat night. \"It continually seemed\nthat he was c it her going to walk out\nor lash out\" commented the warden,\nwho noted that Mr Parker seemed\ndrunk. Dr Young eventually sent him\nhome telling him the matter would be\nkept 'in house' if he returned in the\nmorning to sort things out.\nRichard Parker was escorted out of\nthe hall by the warden and walked to\nhis girlfriend's house in nearby Edith\nRoad. Also a student at Imperial\nCollege, his girlfriend left Parker in\nthe flat soon after they arrived to\nreturn to Southwell in order to\nretrieve his jacket and glasses. Mr\nParker had been particularly upset\nabout leaving these items behind and\ninsisted that she fetch them. Whilst\nthere, she talked to the Warden, commenting that he was acting \"way out\nof character\". She was clearly worried though not overly concerned and\nafter chatting with the Warden for\nabout half an hour, went back to her\nflat.\nOn her return, she found Mr\nParker had hung himself whilst she\nwas out. He had left a rambling suicide note in which his apology for\nthe havoc he had caused in Southwell\nseemed to be his only major concern.\nDr Chapman, of the Biochemistry\nDepartment, expressing his sadness\nat the death of Richard Parker said\n\"...a fine student, it came completely\nout of the blue.\" The company he\nwas working for this year have\ninformed College that they will not\nonly miss him as a person, but also\nmiss his professional contributions\n\"...he was doing an excellent job in\nthe lab.\" All third year biochemists\nwere informed of Richard Parker's death and many of his friends have\nhad the opportunity to talk about\ntheir loss with members of staff. Dr\nChapman talking about suicide in\ngeneral said \"one is one too many.\"\nIt has been left to the jury at the\ninquest, which takes place on the\n13th February, to determine the reasons for Richard Parker's actions,\nthough speculation is rife.\nFunding bonanza for IC\nCatering Staff\nRequired\nFor lune h time& evenings.\n\u00a33.55 per hour\nContact Ian or Yvonne5948080( internal 48080)\nMATHIEU RICHARD The Research Council science budget for 1997/1998, released recently,\ndenotes a clear intention to support\nthe implementation of specific key\nprojects, as reported in Felix 1075.\nThis is particularly apparent for\nresearch into BSE (Bovine\nSpongiform Encephalopathy, or\n\"mad cow disease\") and related dis-eases, which has received an earmarked \u00a317 million from this year's budget, bringing the total allocation\nfor work on this domain to \u00a330 million over three years.\nThe Imperial College School of\nMedicine, one of the leading institutions for investigation into these dis-eases, will be especially affected by\nthis programme. As part of the project of research on the implications\nof the trans miss i bil it y of spongiform\ne ncep halo p athies, around \u00a31 million\nwill be allocated to Imperial College\nresearcher John Collinge and his\nteam. Their mission will be to\nexplore the human prion diseases -the diseases of the same family as the\nBSE- and especially the CreutzfeldJacob syndrome. Dr Rodney\nEastwood, from the Financial\nPlanning department, views this allocation as an appreciable but logical\nrecognition of the \"excellent, 1st class work\" accomplished by\nProfessor Collinge, who is \"making\ngood progress in this difficult and\ndelicate area\".\nAs to the attributions to other\nfields of research, Dr Eastwood\nremarks that very little change has\nbeen made with respect to the previous budget: \"The money allocated to\nthe Research Councils is more or less\nwhat there is at present, plus a few\nsmall increases\", especially for the\nBiotechnology and Biological\nSciences Research Council (plus \u00a35\nmillion) and the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council\n(plus \u00a38 million).\nThe distribution of these sums is\nnot expected to change much either,\nwith a significant majority of the\nallocations (around 75% for the\nParticle Physics and Astronomy\nResearch Council) going, as before,\nto the most productive departments -the same which obtained grades 5 or\n5* at the RAE. If the Royal Society's position was followed, research\nfunds should even be attributed more\nselectively as in the past. However,\nthe Planning Office of Imperial\nCollege expects very similar allocations for its departments as in the previous years.\nThis budget has been generally\nwelcomed positively by most\nresearch councils, seeing it as a guarantee of stability and effectiveness in\nBritish research. Yet some executives have expressed deep concerns\nas to whether the funding, including\nthese allocations, will be sufficient to\nsupport all the high-quality project\ninitiatives which will be presented in\nthe next few years to the Research\nCouncils.\nVaccine cure-all claims are\n\"misleading\" says researcher\nKENT YIP\nA Sunday Times article published on\n12\"\" January this year under the headline \"Vaccine Could Cure All Allergies At A Stroke\" has been\ndescribed as \"misleading\" by Dr\nCharlotte Hetzel, a co-worker in the\nproject headed by Professor Jonathan\nLamb.\nCurrently three million people in\nthis country are thought to be allergic\nto house mites, tiny creatures found\nin most domestic furniture. The vaccine concerned aims to im munis e people against allergic reactions to\nhouse dust mites. It works by redirecting the immune pathway undertaken by white cells on presentation\nwith the protein secreted by house\ndust mites which triggers the allergic\nresponse in the first place.\nThis may potentially be achieved\nby introducing the white cells to an\naltered version of the protein early on\nin life. A strain of genetically engi-nee red, non-pathogenic species of\nmyo bacteria can be used to deliver\nthe vaccine into the body.\nThe results obtained so far in\nexperimental models are promising.\nThe project is still at the laboratory\nstage, and whilst its clinical potential\nhas been recognised, no vaccine for\nclinical trial has yet been prepared. In\nview of this, the suggestion in the\nSunday Times article that the three\nmillion people who are allergic to\nhouse dust mites will benefit immediately from this work may seem\nover optimistic.\n\n"

    "content": "12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 2 4 TH JANUARY\nFor better or worse, the level of\ndebate on Europe seems to be at an\nall-time high. Much of this can be\nattributed to the clowns in the\nReferendum Party, but making this a major campaign issue is highly beneficial at such a important time in the\ndevelopment of the EU. And from\nwhere I am standing, if things aren't sorted out tout de suite, we are in dire\ntrouble, dear reader.\nSome say that Britain seeks only\nnarrow self-interest in Europe, compared to France and Germany that\nare in it for the common good. Where\nBritain differs from our continental\npartners is in the fact that our people\nand our politicians are far more\nclosely aligned in their views on the\nfuture of Europe. You may imagine\nthat the people of Germany are fanatically Euro-enthusiastic. A recent\nsurvey found that a majority of\nGermans want a referendum on the\nsingle currency. The Maastricht\nTreaty only scraped through in\nFrance and Denmark. Our portrayal\nas being Eurosceptic is one that\neveryone in the country should be\nproud of, whether they agree with the\nstance or not. For a country's leaders\nto be so out of touch with public\nopinion on constitutional matters is a perilous situation.\nMonetary union is, of course, the\nhot potato at the moment. Money and\npower have always been synonymous. Therefore, any move to central is e monetary policy is a shift in\npower and thus sovereignty. Or so\nyou would think. This view is unique\nto Britain. The French feel that mon-et ary, and ul ti \u00bb\nmate ly political, J1 Ytl OII\nunion will\nincrease their sovereignty by giving\nthem influence\nover other co un tries, totally ignoring the consequent\nloss of control\nover their own\naffairs. The\nGermans, how ev er, are desperate to\ncede sovereignty\nin order that, once\nand for all, they\ncease to be seen\nas a threat to\nEurope. Less high-mindedly,\nGermany, given her economic might\n(albeit declining) in Europe, realises\nthat exercising control over her partners economies allows her to protect\nthe competitiveness of German\nindustry by preventing all the old\ndod gy ruses such as devaluation or\nBaker1 A311 ii\\ Voice of Reason inflation brought about by slack\nmonetary policy. The early attempt\nto do this, the apocalyptic ally awful\nERM, put such emphasis on killing\ninflation in the 80s without reforming economies, as we did, that it was\na major factor in the high unemployment on the continent.\nNow the\nERM is to grow\ninto EMU( an\nodd bird, invariably seen with\nRod Hull's arm up\nits nether regions,\nthat stands a cat in\nhells chance of\never getting off the\nground). Had\nLady Thatcher not\nousted Ted Heath,\nthis may have\nalready happened;\nthe original plan\nwas for monetary union by\n980, a point he\nomitted to mention when we signed\nup in 1973. Convergence is the name\nof the game for EMU, namely if you\nwish to have a single currency, it\nwould be prudent to ensure that all\nthe participating economies were in\neconomic sync on growth, inflation\nand debt, for example. Oh dear. The\ntricks, fiddles and fudges done to\nachieve this have been incredible.\nThe French have no bb led pension\nfunds, the Dutch have sold gold like\nnobody's business and the Italians\nhave sold everything that wasn't nailed down. On the face of it not\neven Germany should be allowed\ninto EMU, on account of national\ndebt. If these rules, less than perfect\nin any case, are bent to the point of\ncracking, the resulting currency will\nbe fatally flawed. We are best to steer\nwell clear of such a farr ago. Even if the rules were rigidly\nobeyed and genuine efforts were\nmade to meet them, rather than the\nshameless attempts to shoehorn\neconomies into EMU in 1999, the\nbenefits seem illusory. People talk of|\nnot having to change money in\nEurope and the huge assistance to\nbusiness. What they forget are interest rates. We shall end up with rates\ntoo high in one place and too low\nelsewhere, leading to problems in\nboth cases. It's difficult to get the\nwhole of Britain at the same point in\nthe economic cycle, let alone\nGermany and Portugal. The EU should stay as a single market.

Hutton\nThis attitude - which basically\namounts to a boycott of the new\nWaterstone's in all but name - has\nalready been suggested by many,\nand certainly would be a clear way\nto force the College's hand.\nHowever, for this plan to be successful the vast majority of IC students would need to shun the new\nbookstore, and, quite frankly, with\nexams imminent and gaps in lecture notes looming large, the compulsion to finally buy some course\ntexts may prove stronger than\nprinciples.\nYet, to be able to exercise any\nreal power over College, the Union\nneeds the power to be liev ably threaten action - even if none is\ntaken. If the Rector had truly\nbelieved that the Union had the\npower to organise an effective boycott (or any other effective protest\nfor that matter) then this decision\nwould never have been made in the\nfirst place.

The options are\nquite varied, and the yawning chasm\nthat is the end of conventional education is quite wide. It is a daunting\ntask, yet also quite a rewarding one.\nThe selection process established\nby many companies over a great\nnumber of years of interview and\nintake often becomes as revealing to\nthe applicant as to the employer.\nComplex and wordy forms designed\nto eke the best example of your cunning in group situations or your\nfinest hour of leadership make you\nthink about what you have actually\ndone in the twenty or so years previously. Never before has there been an\nopportunity to find out what makes\nyou tick (unless you are already a regular on the psychiatrist's couch)\nas when a psycho metric test is wafted under your nose. These crafty\ndocuments aim to find out your true\npersonality by asking lots of similar\ncomparative questions (just in case\nyou are cheating). Just as valuable is\nthe post-rejection analysis of why\nyour application failed, if you can\nface talking to that particular company again.\nNot everyone, of course, rushes to\nfind themselves a career or even a job. Further study, 'travelling' or a deliberate spell of unemployment\nalso occupy the \"what are you doing\nnow\" files of graduates. Whatever it\nmay be that you end up doing, the\nend of your final year and the slide\ninto 'the real world' can be a major\noccasion.\nNow, however, I open another\nbrochure and fill in another form\nwith little snippets from my past.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 2 4 TH JANUARY\nCampus plan holds few surprises\nMATTHEW BENNETT\nThe new Imperial College plan summary for 1995/96 to 1998/99 contains few surprises, with emphasis\nplaced on development of interdisciplinary research centres and the continuing of the \"Campus Renaissance\"\nscheme to improve the South\nKensington site.\nThe plan is a revised version of\none produced two years ago, and sets\nout the main objectives for college-wide affairs, and covers the integration of the four medical schools into\nthe college, campus changes, curriculum changes and the budgeting\nobjectives as well as general aims of\nthe college.\nThe creation of the Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine is seen\nas a major event, and a way of\nexploiting the \"wealth of clinical\nopportunity in the associated hospitals, and the technological and scientific expertise available in other parts\nof the college.\" The merging of med-ical, scientific and technological\naspects are \"expected to lead to significant advances\", and this is one of\nthe main reasons that multidisciplinary research centres are being set\nup.\nFew changes in the courses or curriculum offered are envisaged, but\nthe plan does refer to the increased\ndemand for graduates to have \"scientific and technical communication\nskills\" and \"professional development courses\" are sited as an area for\ngrowth.\nThe plan also recognises the\nAn artists impression of how the new\n\"existing strengths in music and arts\namongst students and staff and\npledges that the new music and arts\ncentre, to be situated on the top floor\nof the new library, will \"extend the\nbreadth of educational and cultural\nopportunities available to the col-leg e's wider internal and external\ncommunities\". An Arts and Music\ncentre had been planned for a number\nof years following a bequest from a former professor, Nevil Blyth. This\nwould have funded the building of\nmusic practice rooms on the top of\nthe present library. The money was\ninsufficient to fund the plans, which\nwere shelved for a time, until the\nCampus Renaissance project\nrequired the extension of the library\nand allowed a Lottery bid to be\nstaged.\nThis was seen as the perfect opportunity to offset some of the costs of\nextending the top floor for the arts\nArts and Music centre will look.\ncentre, as the necessary cranes and\nbuilding works would already be in\nplace. The Arts and Music centre is\nto be the subject of one of at least\nthree National Lottery grants for\nEstates, with the facilities required\nfor an excellent range of arts fac ili ties, practice rooms and recital spaces\nas well as public access (required for\nthe Lottery money) costing in the\nregion of \u00a32.3million. The building\nextension itself will cost \u00a31,6million. Sources in the Estates Division suggested that the public access to the\nSherfield building would also need to\nbe improved, at a possible cost of\n\u00a31.3million. Other objectives set out in the plan\ninclude the conversion of the Beit\nQuadrangle Biology buildings into\nhalls of residences and the building\nof two completely new halls in\nPrinces' gardens. The plan stresses\nthat opportunities to increase the\nARTISTS IMPRESSION BY SIMON JONES\nnumber of rooms will only be pursued \"at a cost that students can\nafford\". Sports facilities are also cov-ered, with the boat house singled out\nfor mention, but the South\nKensington sports facilities are also\nunder redevelopment with plans for\nanother Lottery grant well advanced.\nThe plan also includes details of\nthe changes to the Queen's lawn\narea, with landscaping for improved\nlooks, access and usability, and as a \"public focus for college\", as detailed\nin Felix 1071. These plans are the\nsubject of a further lottery grant.\nBudget plans include continued self-financing to protect against \"unpredictable changes in external c irc um stances\".\nThe proportion of women in college is also set for increase, with an\nincrease from 18% to 27% over the\nlast 10 years, and a target of at least\n35% by the year 2000 envisaged.\nNew bookstore plans drawn up\ncontinued from front page\nIn a parallel move with the retail\ndiscussions, one of the main areas\nunder review is Union publicity.\nMany people are unaware of how\nmajor a role the Union plays in the\nlife of the College, and how many of\nthe services on campus are run by the\nUnion. In order to remedy this a number a proposals have been put\nforward for raising the Union's pro-file. It has been suggested that a photo board containing photographs\nof the Union staff and sabbaticals\nwith explanations of the jobs they do\nbe put up in the Union to show people which jobs are done by whom.\nThere may also be an introduction\nparty for wardens in Halls of\nResidence so that the Union's message gets to the first people fresher s come into contact with. There may\neven be an Union sandwich and pizza\ndelivery service to the different\ndepartments on campus.\nThe main publicity idea, however,\nis that all posters, letters and leaflets\ncarry the Union logo, as well as that\nall Union catering and recreation services display prominent signs\nreminding people that they are run by\nthe Union. Students also need to be\nmade aware that their clubs and societies could not exist were it not for\nthe Union. Messages to this effect\nwill be put on all posters and advertisements issued by the clubs, and\nmany clubs will be required to adjust\ntheir name and livery to include the\nICU acronym or the phrase \"..sup-ported by Imperial College Union\".\nThe Union also aims to convey the\nmessage to the College that they both\nhave (in theory) the same objective;\ngiving students as\ngood a quality of life\nas possible, and\ntherefore that they\nshould work together\na lot more than they\nappear at present to\nbe doing. \"I think it's unfortunate that the\nCollege and the An artists impression of the present Union book-Union have differing store in the future. Plans for the site include exp an views about what sion into the available space and converting the site\nconstitutes the good from stationary selling to a catering outlet.\nof the students,\" says Mr Williams,\n\"The Union believes that we can best\nserve students and the college community in general by trading and\nthereby gaining a degree of financial\nautonomy from the whims of Higher\nEducation budgets, as well as tailoring our services to suit students'\nneeds.\" Mr Willaims voiced the\nopinion that the College, judged by\nit's actions, often shows that it does\nnot share this view.\nWhatever happens the store will\nhave to be refurbished to allow it to\npursue a different trade, resulting in it\nclosing for a fortnight, likely to be\nduring the Easter vacation to minimise disruption of services.\n\n"

The Union's profile\namongst its members is also under\nreview.\nSuggestions for new services to\nreplace the trade in academic texts\nare varied. The Union will retain the\nbuilding currently known as\nBookstore, since Waterstone's will\nhave a new site in the library build-ing, and most of the suggestions are\nconcerned with what to do with the\nbuilding when it ceases to sell academic texts. Piers Williams Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services)\nsays there will be no trade in books\nof any kind, academic or otherwise,\nsince they could not compete with\nWaterstone's in this field.\nIan Caldwell, Director of Estates,\nhas been assigned to deal with the\nvarious \"administrative\" consequences of the recent decision to\naward the bookstore tender to\nWaterstone's. Talking on the subject\nof the Union's retail sites, he stated\nthat the College are \"not opposed to\nthe Union trading\", refuting recent\nreports that the Rector had declared\nthat the Union should not be allowed\nto trade in a commercial sense.\nThe most realistic suggestions are\nthose of expanding the store's existing trade in college regalia and sta-tio nery, and of transferring the trade\nin newspapers and magazines from\nthe newsagent across the Walkway\nto the store in order to allow the\nnewsagent greater space for confectionery. More adventurous ideas\ninclude a film-developing service, as\nin some other universities, video\nrental, as used to happen at IC, a shop similar to Southside shop for\nthe sale of a limited range of gro-ce ries, and even a cafe bar.\nMr Caldwell added that the current\nbookstore site could be redeveloped\nas \"some fairly sensible [trading]\nactivity\" with the College's blessing.\nOn competition between the various\nservice providers on campus, he\ncommented \"It's good to have two\npeople running these services... It\nkeeps each other on their toes.\"\ncontinued on page four\nLeaky library's power cut\nThe North Block of, the Building is\nCLOSED\nNEWS TEAM Rain water leaking through the\nLibrary roof late on Wednesday\nevening caused a localised power cut\nin the main library and Sherfield\nbuildings, triggering an emergency\nevacuation of College buildings.\nAll alarms on the College main\nsite sounded at around 10 o 'clock on\nWednesday precipitating a general\nevacuation. Speaking to Felix, Keith\nReynolds, Head of Security, ascribed\nthe power failure to \"Water leaking\nthrough the floors of the library and\nshorting out the distribution box.\"\nPeter Wray, Electrical Supervisor in\nthe Estates Division confirmed that\nrain water had flooded the mains\nriser in the library and \"blown out\"\nthe power intake.\nAreas affected by the power cut\ninclude the north side of the library,\nthe NatWest branch on level two of\nSherfield and all corridor lights and\nfire alarms in the Sherfield building.\nMr Wray commented that, electrically speaking, \"you couldn't pick out\nanything worse to have happened.\"\nHe also said that there was a \"lot of\ndamage\" in the building.\nLibrary staff expect that the northern half of the library building will\nnot be fully open until Monday.\nfull story next week\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2 4 TH JANUARY Columns 1\n3\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nThe Daily Mail was on excellent\nform last Friday, carrying a front\npage story decrying Jack Straw as the\n\"Man of Straw\" for 'backing down'\nto his own party's demands for\ntougher opposition to the Police Bill,\nrecently ravaged in the Lords. The\nBill would have given statutory legal\npowers to senior police officers to\nbug and burgle premises in search for\nevidence when investigating serious\ncrime. This managed to unite the\nentire judiciary, most of the Lords\nand the entire media against him.\nCivil rights groups threw fits. The\nonly support Michael Howard had\nwas that of the Labour Home Affairs\nspokesman, Jack Straw, who in desperately trying to outmanoeuvre\nHoward on all crime-related affairs\nfound himself having to support even\nthe most moronic of crime bills -there have been more Criminal and\nPolice Bills in the last seven years\nthan in the last sixty.\nIt is heartening to see that the\nOpposition can occasionally do its\njob properly, and put the defence of\nour civil rights above a quick electoral buck. The potential ramifications of the Bill were serious: since\nthe last Criminal Justice and Public\nOrder Act made certain forms of trespass illegal, the surveillance of road\nprotesters would have been made\nlawful under this Act. The free\nadmission by a number of Chief\nConstables that the powers would be\nused covertly to bug defendants and\ntheir lawyers in the middle of a criminal trial is quite horrifying, let alone\nthe fact that anyone seeking legal\nadvice from the same lawyer is likely to have their conversations taped\nfor good measure. The current draft\n(even with Opposition amendments)\nleft the police so much scope to\ndefine \"serious\" crime that they\ncould have justified bugging anyone\ndaring to cross their path. Their eager\nsupport for an outside commissioner\nto sc rut in is e their decisions suggests\njust how toothless this watchdog\ncould have been.\nSo what is the solution to all this?\nMr Howard's was obvious: all power\nto the police - and on the off-chance\nthat they make a mistake, the\nSurveillance Commissioner will be\nthere the pick up the pieces. From Mr\nHoward's almost daily scribbling s in\nvarious national newspapers, it\nappears that his main problems with\njudges granting the power to bug\npremises would be that it would take\ntoo long and that \"the police would\nbe inhibited\". This is the whole point.\nJudges already have a role in deciding whether sensitive material held\nby doctors or journalists can be\nsearched, and such a system can easily be extended to cover bugging.\nThe judiciary is there to safe gaur d us\nfrom rampant legislators. Allowing\njudges the right to clear bugging\noperations has the support of almost\nall affected parties, would be in line\nwith present practice, and even has\nthe backing of Liberty, the civil\nrights organisation. As one\nConservative peer said : \"this new\npower is one step down a slippery\npath\".\nThe solution to Mr Howard's problems was found for him by the\nLords, when Labour and the Lib\nDems united to throw out this key\npart of the Bill. Although the\nCommons could attempt to bypass\nthe Lords, their wafer-thin majority\nmeans Labour could defeat it and\nthen call a vote of no confidence in\nthe Government, possibly precipitating a General Election. With the\nGovernment popularity at its present\nlevel, and Mr Howard's own marginal seat in the Commons, I doubt he'll\nbe taking the risk.\nWing Chun\nKung Fu\nDEMONSTRATION\n1.30pm Wed 29th January\nUnion Gym\nlearn a martial art that\nmay one day save your life\nSolutions to the Christmas\nGiant Prize Crossword\nAcross:1.

Nothing like this had been\nseen since the Luftwaffe carpet-bombed the Eastend. It even\nprompted fleet-footed Felix to offer\nan apology for \"(his) country's behaviour in the war\" as he gleefully\nswerved past another set of nail-like\nstuds.\nNil-nil at half time hadn't done us\njustice.

Twelve intrepid shooters set\noff for what was for most of them\ntheir first taste of outdoor rifle and\nlong range pistol shooting.\nThe morning consisted of shooting target rifle at 100 yards and practice one of the long range pistol\ncourse of fire. This is two sighting\nshots followed by two series of five\nshots in thirty seconds. This is done\nwith a large calibre pistol such as a44 magnum loaded to the limits of\nsafety to get the bullet there as fast as\npossible. Despite this some reasonable groups were attained which\nbodes well for our attempt to defeat\nOxford and reclaim the Howe Cup\nbefore the government prevents us\nfrom holding the competition again.\nLunch was at the local chip shop\nand the afternoon's shooting was\nrifle at 200 yards and some clay\npigeon shooting. This gave people\nthe opportunity to try out an 1894\nWinchester under lever rifle (John\nWayne fanta s is t) and Lawrence\ncould at last use his shotgun, purchased ten years ago from Purdey for\n\u00a38000 but never fired before. A good\ntime was had by all.\nThe next full-bore rifle trip will be\n(hopefully) at 300 and 500 yards for\nthe Courtman Shield, and inter-CCU\ncompetition and a day out to a clay-shooting ground for some much-needed tuition. Both of these are\nplanned for February, so keep your\neye on the notice board.

Some experimentation with varying the number\nof forwards in the line-out proved to\nconfuse the not-so-cunning Vets.\nSome exceptional passing by the\nbacks ensured that the Vets worked\nhard for their points.

Loads of\nsympathy to Shuggy who only got to\nenjoy 20 minutes of the game before\nbeing damaged making a storming\ntackle.\nChristmas comes late for\nCross-Country's Benny Boy\nA fantastic performance from\nBenny-Boy secured another victory\nfor IC's mens' team. Jennie, with\nher graceful flowing strides, won the\nwomens' race as usual, with Bethan,\nDawn, Ruth and Christina coming\nfourth, fifth, eleventh and fifteenth\nrespectively. Gaffer improved on his\npositions with eighth place and Fishy\nFishick finished a lethargic thir-teen th. Gut-retching hill sessions\nand agonising circuits through the\nautumn proved their worth with\nexcellent results especially from the\nB team.\nA special mention should go to\nYellow-Arse whose poor excuse for\nnot turning up was he was writing a love-letter to his ex-girlfriend. He's got more chance of winning the next\nleague race than getting her back.\n[Good luck Mr Arse - Sports Eds]\n\n"

Ms Gorman, the\nmaverick MP for Billaricay, tabled\nthe motion to hold a nationwide vote\nunder the Ten Minute Rule. He also\nspoke of his plans to trim the expenditure of the Department for Social\nSecurity, (which accounts for a third\nof all government expenditure), and\nnow supports twice the number of\npeople as it did in 1979, when the\nConservative Party first came to\npower.\nWith a third of this budget being\nspent on pensions, control of this sector is crucial to overall stability, and\nMr Lilley emphasised his \"success\"\nin persuading two-thirds of those eligible for state pensions to \"opt-out\"\nand use private sector companies. He\nadded that the UK is in the best position of any European country to deal\nwith the world-wide problem of ageing populations, pointing out that\n\"We've invested \u00a3600 billion to pay\nfor pensions, which is more than the\nrest of Europe put together.\"\nMr Lilley, Member of Parliament\nfor St Albans, defended his attempts\nto cut the money spent on housing\nsupport for young people, single parents and asylum seekers, insisting\nthat the measures did have a significant effect on his overall spending.\nIt appeared that the Secretary of\nState's proudest achievement is in\ncutting benefit fraud, claiming that\nsince his appointment in 1992 his\ndepartment has saved \u00a31.5bn, with\nanother \u00a33bn to come. Mr Lilley\nemphasised that none of his predecessors had established a way of\nanalysing the level of fraud, but that\n\"We invented a system to measure\nit.\"\nHe expressed the opinion that it\nhad been, and would continue to be\nsuccessful at measuring fraud, allowing it to be better combated. The\ntelephone hotline\nfor benefit cheats,\n\"Squeal on a rat\",\nwas cited as a particular example of\nsuccesful anti-fraud\ncampaigning.\nTurning to the\ncurrent political sit-u ation, the diminutive Minister admitted that his party\nhad \"done our best\nSt Albans MP Peter Lilley in ju bu lent mood. He refused to deny that\nhe would be a Conservative Party\nleadership candidate after the\nGeneral Election,\nto shoot ourselves in the foot from\ntime to time.\" Ignoring suggestions\nthat the recent Private Member's Motion on the EU had once again\nemphasised divisions, Mr Lilley\nexpressed his hope that \"that is all\nbehind us\", and pointed to a group of\n\"50 Labour MPs led by Denzil\nDavies\" with similarly Eurosceptic\nviews.\nWith the Labour Party pledging to\nkeep to Conservative spending plans,\nif elected at the next General\nElection, the Minister denounced\nGordon Brown's promises as \"not\ncredible\". Mr Lilley admitted that his\npreferred General Election date is 1\nMay, but the possibility of a Labour\nvictory does not appear to overly\nworry the MP with a majority of\n16,404.

Using your skill and judgement, you must choose which four\npeople you think will be elected to each of the four sabbatical positions, and which four will be runners-up (ie lose and come second). First and second place positions are\nsimply determined by who wins most votes in the eventual elections. To win, you will have to guess not only who will be elected, but also who is likely to stand for election.\nIncluded opposite is a list of possible 'players.' These are people who currently hold positions on Council (the governing body of the Union) plus a few wildcard s. They\nare*the people closely involved with the Union whom we feel are most likely to stand for one of the four sabbatical positions. We have placed them in divisions, according\nto the seniority of their position within the Union, and assigned a points value to the players in each division. THE POSITION OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE LEAGUE REFLECTS ONLY THEIR CURRENT STATUS WITHIN THE UNION: IT DOES NOT REPRESENT HIS/HER LIKELIHOOD OF STANDING OR BEING ELECTED.\nThere are two other 'players'; you should enter 'New Election' as a second choice for a position if you think that only one candidate will stand for that post, or if you think\npeople would rather vote for a new election than any of the candidates. If you think someone other than those included on our list will stand for a particular post, then include\nthe 'None of the above' player in the relevant place on your team. You do not have to state who you think 'None of the above' will be. If 'New election' or 'None of the\nabove' finishes in the place you have guessed, you score the same points as if you had guessed an actual individual's result.\nRemember, you are strictly limited in the number of points you can spend on players, and so may not be able to field your first choice team... This is where the element of\nchance comes in. Good luck!\nFirst Prize:\nTwo return tickets to Paris and a bottle of Champagne\nSabbaticals? What Sabbaticals?\nFor those not in the know, each year Imperial College Union holds a campus-wide ballot to elect new sabbatical officers.\nThere are four sabbaticals elected by campus-wide ballot at ICU: President, Deputy President (Finance & Services), Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) and Felix Editor. They hold their position for year while taking a break (a sabbatical) from their studies. During this time, each is ultimately\nresponsible for running the services and performing the duties under their remit. These people are your representatives in many different areas, whether\nattending college committees on academic affairs or being responsible for the finances of the Union and the many clubs and societies which you may belong\nto.\nFor example, the Deputy President (Clubs and Societies) in charge of the running of the many clubs and societies of the Union as well as health and safety and representing the Union (and you) on college committees, among other duties. Thus, even if you are the Caving Club chairman implementing H&S policy or just an ordinary member of the International Tamil Society, the DP (C&S) looks after your interests.\nThis year's sabbatical elections will take place in early March. However, the papers for nominations go up on February 3'd for two College weeks. Any\nfull member of Imperial College Union may stand for any of the positions listed above. To be able to run for election, however, each nominee must have a proposer and twenty second ers, all of whom must also be full members of the Union. After the papers come down on February 14'\\ campaigning proper can\nstart, and the, 1996-97 sabbatical race can begin.\nIf you have any queries about the elections or wish to find out more about any of the posts, contact the President, Eric Allsop, via the Union Office, or\nspeak to the present en cum bents. The small print\n\u2022The closing date for entries is 5.00pm, Monday 3rd February. ONE ENTRY PER PERSON.\n\u2022Competition results will be determined using 1997 ICU Sabbatical election results, as confirmed by ICU elections committee.\n\u2022The highest-scoring entry, as calculated by Felix, will be the winner. In the unlikely event of a tie, the winner will be the entrant whose original team had the lowest combined\npoints value. Failing this, the winner will be selected at random from those sharing the highest score.\n\u2022The competition is NOT open to the following groups of people:\n\u2022All those listed as 'players' opposite.\n\u2022Current sabbaticals.\n\u2022The Felix staff.\n\u2022Any unlisted 1997 sabbatical candidate.\n\u2022Anyone who is not a UG, PG or member of staff at Imperial College.\n\u2022Anyone acting on behalf of those above.\n\u2022The Felix Editor retains the right to declare the competition null and void at any time and to amend the rules without notice. Any change in rules will be published in Felix.\n\u2022The results of the competition, and the points value assigned to each player shall have no bearing whatsoever upon the results of the election. Anyone suspected of contravening 1CU sabbatical election rules, as laid down in the ICU constitution, may be subject to ICU disciplinary procedures.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2 4 TH JANUARY NEWS FEATURE 7\n\"Going once; Going twice; Honours\ndegree sold to the man in the hat\"\nGraduate tax, top-up fees, vouchers,\nlevies, income contingent loans\nEveryone agrees something needs to be\ndone about student finances - but what?\nSimon Wistow investigates\nIn an effort to redress the imbalance\nin student funding created by the\nGovernment in recent years, the\nNUS have proposed a system of\ngraduate taxation. The scheme was\none of many detailed in 'Funding\nOur Future', a policy statement produced by them and described as:\n\"a hypo the cate d tax ... levied on\ngraduates and which is used to fund\npost-16 education. This would sub-sid is e both maintenance and part of\ntuition fees. Maintenance may continue through the existing grant s ys tem. Alternatively, a student could\npay a proportion of tuition and maintenance up front and hence not be\nliable for Graduate Tax\"\nHowever the tax f aired well in a assessment based upon whether the\nschemes would widen access of\nhigher education, alleviate student\nhardship, fund further education stu-dents, fund part-time students and\nenhance quality of educational\nobjectives.\nGraduates who are able would pay\na percentage on Income Tax or\nNational Insurance, related to\nincome, throughout their working\nlives. Graduates would, therefore,\npay higher rates of Income Tax or\nNational Insurance than non graduates. Graduates would only start paying once they had earned a certain\namount. It could be repaid by a flat\nrate, for example lp in the pound of\nincome tax paid, irrespective of tax\nbanding, or a proportional rate\ndependant on income.\nThe cost to students would only\narise after graduation, in Income Tax\nor National Insurance accruing\nindefinitely throughout the graduates\nworking life. However, as the actual\namount repaid would be based on\nincome, students could not know in\nadvance how much they would end\nup repaying, the eventual cost to students depending upon a number of\nfactors (for example, their future\nincome, tax bands under incoming\ngovernments and the length of their\nworking lives).\nThe advantages of this system are\nfairly obvious; reducing the disincentive to enter higher education\n(with repayment dependant on future\nearnings not current economic situ a tion), and clearly applying fairly and\nequally to every student. It would\nalso provide additional funds for\nexpansion. As a calculable figure this\nwould allow funding councils and\ninstitutions to plan more effectively\nfor future expansion.\nThe disadvantages of such a scheme are equally obvious.\nStudents would not know how much\nthey might end-up repaying, and\nthere is no control over repayments\nbecause they are taken at source.\nMore importantly, because graduates\npay over their working lives some\nwill actually end up repaying far\nmore than the cost of their higher\neducation. Furthermore, the suggestion that the well-off might be able to\nopt out by paying their maintenance\nand tuition up front raises the question of whether the scheme should be\nmade compulsory.\nThe NUS and the Labour party\nhave voiced their approval of the\nscheme and David Blunkett, the\nShadow Minister for Education,\nrevealed that Labour would seek private sponsorship for a \u00a32.4 billion -per-year loan system. He has however admitted that students are likely to\npay a higher rate of interest on loans\nfor living costs under a Labour government as they will repay over\ntwenty years through National\nInsurance contributions.\nIt seems a fair and just system\n(assuming that the days when a free\neducation was expected, not just\nprayed for, are long gone). It acts as\nan incentive to work at your degree\nand only taxes those that have made\nuse of the system. There will always\nbe the argument that it will discourage people from going to the more\nexpensive universities (like IC), but\nin this market led age it might even\npersuade universities to price themselves aggressively. Market competition has lowered the cost of crossing\nthe Channel or making phone calls,\nso maybe we can see cut price\ndegrees in the future.\nOptions for Change\nMaintain the status quo\nKeep the present systems of grants and loans\nUse of the Tax system\nA general increase of Income Tax could be used to fund adequate student\nsupport , and increased funding for higher and further education. Either taxation levels or tax bands could be altered, or spending priorities changed.\nA Maintenance Income Contingent Loan\nA loan system towards maintenance, whereby repayment is based on a level of earnings. Students borrow a loan to pay for maintenance. This would\ndiffer from the present system of student loans as it would be flexible and\nrepayments would be related to future income. Repayment of the debt generated by the loan could then be collected through the present National\nInsurance or Income Tax systems. (As with the present Loans system, it is\nassumed that the repayment interest rate will not reflect the full market rate).\nA Fee Income Contingent Loan\nRoughly the same as the Maintenance Loan but based upon the premise\nthat, in addition, students would repay a proportion of their tuition fees.\nTop Up Fees\nI'm not even going to mention these despicable creatures.\nVouchers\nMuch the same as the new nursery vouchers. Each individual is allocated\na number of post-16 education vouchers throughout their lifetime.\nEmployers Levy\nEmployers would pay an additional increment on their National Insurance\ncontributions - so employing a student would directly cost them more, thus\nsuggesting the possibility that employers would actually favour experienced\n(ie. older) non-graduates, rather than fresh, shiny faced, college leave rs.
