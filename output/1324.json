    "content": "Wicked, wicked\nDeep Jungle is massssif, says Harriet Wellington\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nDeep Jungle views itself as an\nambassador to exonerate the clich\u00e9s\nthat bind us to age-old perceptions\nof the jungle: what really happened\nin jungle history, what\u2019s really there\nnow and what state is it all in?\nThis illustrated volume accompanies the ITV series of the same\nname. The series\u2019 investigative\ntechnology is impressive, allowing\nunseen footage and photography.\nFrom flying remote-controlled cameras to mice painted with fluorescent\npowder, the production team has\ncarried out thorough and inspiring\nresearch. Deep Jungle comprises a\nvery broad range of topics, however\nit surprisingly only touches on the\njungle\u2019s flora and fauna, on which\none might hope for more.\nA history of the jungle evolves into\ndiscussion of various controversies.\nPearce\u2019s book addresses political,\nmythological, tribal and ideological issues central to jungle past,\npresent and future. However, if one\nwere to look for any Attenboroughesque narrative of \u2018how the leopard got its spots\u2019 type detail, Deep\nJungle would be lacking.\nTouching on the idiosyncrasies of\nrandom species, the book is a captivating splutter of factual descrip-tion. From the plant perspective,\nwe hear about the discovery of the\nregal aphrodisiac chocolatyl drink\nusing the vanilla bean and discovery\nof the highly valuable nutmeg and\nmace, at one point worth more than\ntheir weight in gold. Then onto the\nBrazil nut tree and why it grows\nexclusively in Brazil and its indebtedness to the agouti guinea pig for\ngermination of its seeds.\nNext Pearce sparsely touches on\nthe medical secrets held within the\nrainforest pharmacy. We\u2019re told of\nthe origin of HIV within monkeys\ncarrying AIDS, of the rosy periwinkle holding the secret to fight childhood leukemia, and of the Ebola\nvirus believed to have originated\nfrom infected bush meat. The jungle\u2019s consumer arena follows,\nwhere Pearce enlightens us about\nthe popular cuisine, souvenirs and\ncommodities yielded from its vast\nexpanse. Shockingly, a kilogram\nof soft turtle shell from rainforest\nswamps can fetch up only \u00a31 sterling\nfor the local villagers in up-market\nAsian restaurants. Equally surpris-ingly, we\u2019re introduced to the market delicacies of Chinese bat faeces\nand the fallopian tubes of frogs (only\nwhile stocks last).\nThe book concludes by tossing up\nvarious proposals: imagine transport without the strange, milky\nexcrescence from a tree found deep\nwithin the Amazon (we\u2019re talking\nrubber); imagine the 19th century\nImperial conquests without the bark\nof an obscure shrub from the foothills of the Andes (think tonic water).\nFinally, Deep Jungle polemicises\nabout the destruction and devastation that logging, mining and pollution has caused in the rainforests.\nTo categorise Pearce\u2019s adventure would be an impossible task.\nSpanning biology, evolutionary\ntheory, history and chemistry, Deep\nJungle is a compelling if sporadic\nread.\nl The TV series Deep Jungle\nwas shown on Tuesdays, ITV1\nDeep Jungle\nby Fred Pearce\nEden Project Books\n\u00a318.99\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 26 May 2005 11\nThe deep jungle: incredible\nTHURSDAY\n26 MAY\nUNION EVENTS\nQUIZ\n7.30pm\nReynolds Bar, Charing Cross\nHospital\n\u00a32 entry\nWin yourself an XBOX!

    "content": "FESTIVALS\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to ignore the\nfact that summer is the season for\nthe music festival. However, what\nis often overlooked is that music\nfestivals are not all tents, mud and\nhuge speakers; some festivals are\nsomewhat more civilised and less\nhazardous to one\u2019s health. These\nare, of course, those showcasing\nclassical music.\nSummer is the season for the open\nair performances and intriguing\ndestinations. Having said that, you\nneed not travel far to experience\nthe festival atmosphere \u2013 just take\na short walk to Holland Park, whose\nopera festival is one of Kensington\u2019s\nbetter kept secrets. However, given\nthe recent improvement in quality\n(there were some rather \u2018interesting\u2019 productions on offer about eight\nyears ago) and the increased media\ncoverage this has engendered, it\nwill not remain a secret for much\nlonger.\nPerformances are held in the\npark\u2019s eponymous Holland House.\nThe House offers a ready-made\nbackdrop for productions that could\nnot be complained about; stately, but\nat the same time unobtrusive.\nUnder the guidance of James\nClutton and Michael Volpe, Opera\nHolland Park has been able to\nmove on from the rather below-par\nquality that it was suffering, and\nsurvive a rather abrupt change of\norchestras. The opera in Holland\nPark is now definitely a place to\ngo to spot up-and-coming talent\nand established names. And unlike\nGlyndebourne and Bayreuth, you\ndon\u2019t have to plan years in advance\nand sell your soul to get tickets.\nJust wander into Holland Park or\ngo to their website for ticket details:\nwww.operahollandpark.com.\nThis year\u2019s season begins on June\n7 and runs until the start of August.\nThe productions on offer are mostly\nreasonably well-known operas sung\nin their original language with surti-tles provided, so no one need worry\nabout not understanding anything.\nGiven the venue is \u2018open air\u2019, there is\nalso the rather vital addition to any\nBritish summer on hand \u2013 a canopy\nto ensure that even when the heavens open the show can go on and the\naudience doesn\u2019t begin to resemble\na collection of wet rats.\nThe season opens with\nVerdi\u2019s Macbeth and Bellini\u2019s La\nSonnambula. However, if you want\ntickets for either of those produc-tions, I\u2019d really recommend getting\na move on. I checked availability\nlast week and tickets were getting\nscarce; not least because Hugh\nCanning in the Sunday Times named\nMacbeth as one of his top ten choices for summer opera. The season\ncontinues with Madama Butterfly,\nL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore, Yevgeny Onegin\nand concludes with Giordan\u2019s\nAndrea Ch\u00e9nier. Paola Smith\n\u25cf For more information on opera\nfestivals around the world, the best\nplace to start is Opera: Festivals\n2005, a magazine. This covers festivals in all locations and provides all\nof the necessary contact information you could dream of. It\u2019s a little\nhard to come by, but the shop at the\nRoyal Opera House carries it, as will\nany record stores with a decent classical music section. Otherwise, the\nmagazine\u2019s website is www.opera.\nco.uk.\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nClassical, cutting edge, primal\nRevelations with the Royal Ballet\nDANCE\nI am more of an opera person than\na ballet person, so it was with some\ntrepidation that I booked tickets\nfor one of the Royal Ballet\u2019s mixed\nprogrammes. It was with yet more\ntrepidation that I headed off to the\nperformance last week, but that was\nfor rather different reasons involving a morning exam the following\nday. However, what is done is done.\nI was originally tempted to get\nthe tickets by the promise of being\nable to see Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite\nof Spring, having read about the\nBallets Russes last summer, but\nwas very pleasantly surprised by\nthe rest of the programme. Mixed\nbills commonly involve three shorter productions all staged on the\nsame night, separated by intervals.\nThis particular group consisted of\nThe Dream, set to Mendelssohn\u2019s\nmusic for A Midsummer Night\u2019s\nDream, The Rite of Spring and a\nnew work entitled Three Songs \u2013\nTwo Voices set to music written by\nJimi Hendrix.\nAfter the more traditional fare of\nThe Dream, Three Songs \u2013 Two\nVoices was definitely something\ncompletely different and entirely in\na class of its own; simply put, it\nwas stupendous. The evening was\nrounded off with The Rite, not with\nthe original Diaghilev choreography,\nbut with the 60s MacMillan choreog-raphy, which, while not the classic\nversion, still managed to portray the\nvery primal nature of the ballet that\nwas so shocking to audiences when\nit was premiered in 1923.\nI have never been in an audience that was quite so enthusiastic in its support, particularly for\nEdward Watson who danced the role\nof Oberon in The Dream. To be hon-est, I enjoyed his performance, but\nhe didn\u2019t really earn such rapturous applause \u2013 his Titania, Leanne\nBenjamin, far outshone him as he\nwobbled his way through their duet.\nThat is my humble opinion, but it\nmust be pointed out that Watson\u2019s\nmost enthusiastic fans did leave\nafter The Dream and so were perhaps just there to see him and might\nhave been a little bit biased.\nThree Songs \u2013 Two Voices refers\nto the music being an arrangement\nof three of Hendrix\u2019s songs, Third\nStone from the Sun, Little Wing\nand Fire, each portrayed, princi-pally, by a pair of dancers. The musical arrangement was full of vigour\nand the choreography more than\nmatched it. The only unfortunate\nthing about this ballet was the substitution of the violin at times for the\nguitar; violins can reach notes that\nonly dogs should be able to hear and\nthey do so with one of the most pain-inducing tones.\nThis ballet truly demonstrated the\npower of dance in interpreting music\nand also served to show that dance,\nin the form of ballet, is a hugely\nversatile and modern medium that\nrequires real athleticism.\nGiven the rapturous receipt of\nThree Songs \u2013 Two Voices from both\naudiences and critics, it can only\nbe a matter of very little time until\nit is back on stage. I do urge anyone remotely interested and curious\nabout dance to sit through whatever\nit is scheduled alongside and experience it \u2013 it is quite possibly the most\npowerful piece of dance I\u2019ve ever\nseen. Sylvia was a spectacle not to\nbe missed, but this is beyond any\nmore words I have at my disposal.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\n\u201cThis truly proved\nthat ballet is a\nhugely versatile and\nmodern medium\nthat requires real\nathleticism\u201d\nJimi Hendrix: composer of the music for the Royal Ballet\u2019s latest\nproduction, Three Songs - Two Voices\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 26 May 2005\n12\nMusic festivals:\nthere is another way\nStep away from the tent. You know you want to\nMixed Bill\nRoyal Ballet\nCovent Garden, WC2\nThe Dream \u2013 Mendelssohn\nThree Songs - Two Voices \u2013 Hendrix\nThe Rite Of Spring \u2013 Stravinsky\nOpera Holland Park\nHolland Park, W8\nSeason Begins: 7 June\nBox Office: 0845 230 9769\nwww.operahollandpark.com\nPeople in different countries do\nthings differently. This is rather\nobvious; but it never ceases to surprise me just how vast the variation\nis sometimes. Stand at Waterloo station for 20 minutes and no-one will\nbother you. You may get jostled a\nbit, but nothing more. Get off the\nEurostar in Paris and, unless you\nmanage to make a quick getaway,\nyou will soon find yourself bombarded with questions and comments\nfrom streams of people you don\u2019t\nknow. However, this isn\u2019t really my\npoint at the moment \u2013 the plan was\nto say a few words on Paris and the\narts.\nThis brings me on to buskers.\nMore often than not, the last people\nyou want to have in your carriage\non the train are buskers, however,\nI was pleasantly surprised by the\nquality of some Parisian busking.\nA trio of performers boarded my\ncarriage and proceeded to make me\nforget all about having missed my\nintended train. These guys meant\nbusiness, which was patently obvious not only from the quality of \u2018the\nshow\u2019 but also from the very fact\nthat one of them was lugging round\na double bass \u2013 much more impressive than the occasional guy with\nguitar and harmonica extras that\nwe get here.\nMoving away from the buskers,\nI have decided to make a couple\nof recommendations on some\nsights you may miss when in Paris.\nFirstly, Sainte Chapelle: after\nfour failed attempts to get in to\nsee this, I was richly rewarded by\na spectacular sight. The chapel\nwas built by Louis IX to house his\ncollection of relics. The most\nstunning feature is definitely the\nimpressive array of stained glass\nwindows, most of which still boast\ntheir original glass. This is Gothic\narchitecture and decoration at its\npinnacle.\nThe other place of interest I\u2019d\nlike to point out is the National\nMuseum of the Middle Ages. This\nhouses the tapestries that are the\nsubject of the last Tracy Chevalier\nnovel as well as an impressive array\nof medieval art and artefacts. The\nmuseum\u2019s buildings are also worth\nseeing from both historical and\nartistic viewpoints.\nPAOLA SMITH\nARTS EDITOR\nBusking, the Paris way\n\n"

The shield awarded\nto the winning medical school\ndates back to 1865, pre-dating\nthe modern Olympics by just\nover 30 years, and is a beautiful trophy to lay claim to.\nSo Imperial Medics fight it\nout in the Medical Schools\ncompetition and thoroughbred Imperial students go\ninto battle for the Universities\ncompetition. Simple... well not\nquite, as the medics\u2019 points\nalso count in the universities\ncompetition overall. Why?\nwell, because basically we\u2019re\nall from the same big happy\nfamily at the end of the day,\nand us medics just love helping people.\nSo now you know what it\u2019s\nall about, we\u2019ll start from the\nbeginning. As the sun rose on\nSunday morning, the Imperial\nteam was select (small), elite\n(well, more so than the med-ics) and well organised (again,\nits all relative), but were out-gunned and outnumbered by\nteams from King\u2019s, UCL and\nGoldsmiths.\nIt looked grim for Imperial\nand they knew it. The first\ninklings of self-doubt spread\nthrough the team like a mosquito in a nudist colony. The\nImperial Medics were not\nmuch better \u2013 bigger defi-nitely, but not better.

    "content": "At last, the movie we\u2019ve all been\nwaiting for is here! It\u2019s been what\nseems like ages since Episodes I\nand II hit the big screen, and finally\nit\u2019s time for Star Wars Episode III:\nRevenge of the Sith. I must say it\nwas certainly worth the wait.\nThe third film takes place during\nthe height of the Clone Wars, and\nbegins with an amazing space battle as Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor)\nand Anakin (Hayden Christensen)\nlead an attempt to rescue the kidnapped leader of the Galactic Senate\nand secret Sith Lord, Chancellor\nPalpatine (Ian McDiarmid).\nUpon their arrival back on\nCoruscant, Anakin greats his wife\nPadme (Natalie Portman) and\nlearns he is to be a father. Having\nto keep this secret, along with his\nmarriage to Padme, troubles Anakin\ngreatly.\nThrough the night, he is troubled by dreams and visions of his\nbeloved wife dying during child-birth. However, Anakin learns from\nChancellor Palpatine of a once great\nSith Lord, whose knowledge of the\ndark side of the force was so great\nthat he could cheat death and stop\npeople from dying.\nAs the Jedi Knights are being dispatched across the galaxy to help\nfight in the wars, Anakin is further tempted by the prospect of the\nknowledge of how to save Padme\nfrom death, eventually learning\nof Palpatine\u2019s position as the Sith\nLord and pledging his allegiance to\nhim. He is now no longer is Anakin\nSkywalker, but Darth Vader. So\nbegins his journey to the Dark Side.\nFirst off, this movie is visually\nstunning. There are a few original\ntreats that have never been seen\nbefore, such as Obi Wan riding on\nthe back of a gigantic lizard, but on\nthe whole the special effects are\nmostly typical of the other prequels.\nHowever, the sheer quantity is far\ngreater and I guarantee you will not\nbe disappointed.\nRevenge of the Sith is non-stop\naction. The fight scenes are stunning and amazingly choreographed.\nNever have so many light sabres\nclashed in any other Star Wars\nmovie. The last hour of the film\nis really intense and will have you\nglued to the screen as, towards the\nend, the inevitable clash between\nObi Wan and his old apprentice\nAnakin takes place. Truly gripping\nstuff.\nMcGregor carries the film with\nhis terrific performance as Obi Wan\nand does a wonderful job of creating the link between the younger\nversion of his character in the previous films and the much older Obi\nWan in the original trilogy (played\nby Alec Guinness). Unfortunately\nChristensen\u2019s acting, yet again, is\nbelow par, although marginally better than his previous performance\nin Attack of the Clones.\nDespite Christensen\u2019s hollow per-formance, there is nothing else to\nbring this film down. It\u2019s exactly\nas I was expecting the third movie\nto be, which is good, since I had\nhigh expectations. Revenge of the\nSith delivers excitement, action and\neven a laugh or two.\nI sense the force is strong with\nthis one. Enjoy this very much, you\nwill.

    "content": "6 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 26 May 2005\nClubs & Societies felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Chris Rowlands\nI feel I should confess a sin before I finish this run of articles. I may have inadvertently caused people to believe that I\nwas the world\u2019s foremost authority on all\nthings juggling, and for this I apologise.\nI realise that some people may have\nobserved the easy-going yet well-informed\nnature of these articles and taken them to\nbe a source of condensed juggling knowledge passed down secretly for millennia\nby only the most talented artists, but this\nis not the case.\nSo why the sudden urge to confess everything in the pages of Felix? Well, let\u2019s\njust say that, during the production of\nthis particular piece, not only did we find\nsomeone who could do the same tricks, he\ndid them rather better than we did.\nWe at Juggling Soc decided that the\nfinal episode should be dedicated to the\nmost visual (if not that difficult) art we\nknow \u2013 the fire staff.\nThe principle is simple: take a stick\nabout 1.5m long and spin it around your\nbody. Regular readers will probably anticipate how we will make this more interesting \u2013 yes, we\u2019re going to set it on fire.\nAll the usual disclaimers apply here\n\u2013 if you aren\u2019t certain that you can do this\nsafely, don\u2019t pick up the staff. Keep a fire\nextinguisher, a fire blanket and a friend\non standby in case something goes wrong,\nand don\u2019t wear artificial fibres since they\nare quite flammable and will melt all over\nyou, which isn\u2019t much fun.\nThe most fun to be had with a fire staff\nactually occurs within the first few sec-onds. Normally the wicks of a fire-toy are\ndipped in paraffin, shaken off, and then\nset on fire. Not so the fire staff \u2013 the wicks\nare left saturated and the staff spun into\nthe air. This propels paraffin in all directions and creates two very large sheets\nof flame [see picture 1], which impresses\nthe opposite sex if nothing else.\nOnce the staff comes down again, spin\nit backwards on one arm. You will quickly\ndiscover that your arm doesn\u2019t go that\nfar, and the staff carries quite a lot of\nmomentum, so you\u2019re going to have to\npass it to the other hand. Place your other\nhand under the one holding the staff and\ncatch it [see picture 2]. While maintaining\nthe momentum of the staff, pass it across\nyour body so that it is now spinning in the\nsame direction, but on the other side of\nyour body. With a long-exposure shot, this\nlooks quite pretty [see picture 3].\nWhile this looks impressive, it\u2019s actually quite basic, so at this point we\u2019ll show\nyou what happens if you give the staff\nto someone who is quite good at it [see\npicture 4].\nIf you\u2019d like to see quite how to make\nthis ludicrously difficult pattern hap-pen, you can come along to juggling on\nTuesdays from 6pm in the union \u2013 contact\njuggling@ic.ac.uk for more information\n(including where to get cheap paraffin).\nFinally, I should thank all the people\nwho have helped make these articles\n\u2013 Chris, Nez, Steve and Tom for showing\noff in front of the camera, John for taking\nthe photos, and of course me. I would\nthank people for reading, but I\u2019m pretty\nsure more people use these articles for\nlining the cat\u2019s litter tray.\nJUGGLING CLUB\nTen things I can do that you can\u2019t\nEPISODE TEN: The fire staff\n1 2\n3 4\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 26 May 2005 5\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe Rector\u2019s role\nSir,\nI would like to express my appreciation of last week\u2019s article on your\ninterview with Sir Richard Sykes.\nI\u2019m sure there aren\u2019t many of us who\nwouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to haul\nour esteemed Rector over the coals\nand grill him on our pet grievances,\nso it was with great interest that I\nturned to page 10 of Felix. On the\nwhole, I was not unpleasantly sur-prised. The article managed to dispel some of the mystery surrounding\nthe head of our College, and gave\nsome indication of what\u2019s to come.\nThere are, however, some points\nthat bother me and that I\u2019d like to\nvoice. First of all: the library situ-ation. I cannot either corroborate\nor dispute the famous librarian\u2019s\nclaims. I can say, though, that I and\nseveral of my fellow students feel\nthat the Rector has got wholly the\nwrong idea. While we do enjoy the\nluxury of being able to stay in the\nlibrary and work until the wee hours\nof the morning, this is not a call to\nclose all the other libraries. Each\ndepartment has its own history and\nsense of self \u2013 the departmental\nlibraries are one of the best ways\nof safeguarding that. Sentimentality\naside, it is painfully obvious to anyone using the library over this period\nthat its capacity is already stretched.\nIf Sir Richard\u2019s plans for disposing\nof all the other study areas were to\ngo ahead, the building would need\nto double in size to accommodate\nall the people and publications, or\nface being woefully inadequate. The\nidea of turning Waterstone\u2019s into a\ncafeteria is, in my view, ridiculous.\nWaterstone\u2019s provides a most convenient and affordable (as much\nas academic books ever are) serv-ice. Most of all, it caters specifically to the students\u2019 needs, which\nis invaluable and off-campus bookshops could not come near filling the\ngap. Unfortunately, Mr Sykes seems\nto have already made up his mind\nabout a lot of this, and I expect much\nof it to fall on deaf ears.\nOn top-up fees: I would like to\nsee the various university authorities petitioning the government for\nbetter funding to make higher education more accessible. If Labour is\nso committed to the 50% target and\npromoting the UK\u2019s academic stand-ing, why aren\u2019t lower university fees\npart of that?\nLast but not least, I wish to raise\nthe issue of the general opinion of\nthe Rector. There is the feeling that\na lot of what happens around the\nCollege in terms of changes and\nprocedures is not only beyond the\ncontrol of the students (which, to\na certain extent, is to be expect-ed), but that the students are not\nproperly consulted or even informed\nof anything. How can he voice concern about the student body (\u201cwe\nwant to encourage them, show that\nwe care about them\u201d) when he himself is such an intangible figure, who\nmany feel takes little or no notice of\nwhat the students want to say, and\nwhat they want to happen?\nYours,\nAlistair Finn\nAeronautics\nArdi Kolah, Imperial\u2019s Director of\nCommunications, responds:\nIt\u2019s always easy to criticise those\nin authority and to some extent the\nRector is a soft target for any such\ncriticism that\u2019s going. But Alistair\u2019s\npoints are way off the mark.\nA substantial part of the communications effort is focused on improving internal communications,\nincluding communication with our\nstudents. And Sir Richard\u2019s right\nbehind this effort.\nWe\u2019ve also ensured that students\nare engaged in the heart of the\ndecision making process and the\npresident of ICU sits on Council.\nThis provides an effective voice for\nstudents at the highest level in our\nCollege and ensures that students\nhave a say in issues that materially\naffect their quality of life.\nSir Richard makes every effort to\nmeet as many students as he can to\nsolicit their views and opinions.\nOf course we could always do\nmore and I\u2019d be interested to hear\nfrom other readers of Felix where\nwe can improve our efforts in this\nregard [a.kolah@ic.ac.uk, 020 7594\n6699]. But to set the record straight,\nSir Richard has been instrumental\nin driving through developments\nin key facilities and services for\nstudents.\nThese include the multi-million\npound re-development of new student accommodation at Southside;\na \u00a317.5m state-of-the-art Sports\nCentre development which will be\nfree of charge for students wishing to use its swimming and gym\nfacilities; 24-hour library opening to\ncover revision requirements; more\ncash machines around campus and\n\u00a320,000 fund for the Student\u2019s Union\nSummer Ball.\nAll of these developments have\ncome about through engaging with\nstudents and listening to what\nthey would like to see happen at\nImperial. And Sir Richard should\nbe recognised for helping to drive\nthese changes through.\nLetters\nColumns felix@ic.ac.uk\nDear readers,\nIn precisely one hour and twenty-six minutes, Stormy Woods is going\nto be enjoying a beverage with one of\nFelix\u2019s most esteemed columnists,\nthe lovely Mr Geraldes. Hopefully,\nhis presence in person will be as\ncharming as his presence on paper.\nIf this isn\u2019t so, I\u2019ll have much to\nreport, and so shall he \u2013 since this\nmeeting is undoubtedly tip top column fodder.\nI\u2019ve got very little else to report. I\nhanded my project in on Friday, and\nhave been partying non-stop since.\nVery little in the way of depravity has happened \u2013 five pints of\nKronenbourg do not make Stormy\nlower her standards to pizza-faced\nlinguistics students who speak poorer French than she does.\nPizza faces aside, there\u2019s also been\na marriage proposal. No, not the stereotypical Asian type involving two\nsets of parents and a dowry \u2013 but a\nspontaneous one from an IC Estates\nworker on the Hammersmith cam-pus. Flattering as it may seem after\na ten minute chat, gentlemen older\nthan my father are not quite what\nI\u2019m after. Night-carers are available\nfrom social services, you know. And\nfunctional packages are a necessity\nto keep up with someone as passionate as I am. Sex to me is like oxygen\nto the rest of you...\nOxygen. Oxygene. I took a trip\ndown memory lane last night, whilst\nsorting through my extensive CD col-lection. Placebo, Mansun, Amen UK,\nthe Source, Mica Paris and D\u2019Angelo\n\u2013 I\u2019d like to think I had taste as a\nShirley Manson-alike teenager. So\nmany moments captured in a song;\nmy first kiss to Kula Shaker\u2019s Hush,\nmy first dance to Brown Sugar.\nClassic. I wonder what my first fuck\nwill be to...?\nFirst fuck? Stormy, the sex columnist hasn\u2019t actually had intercourse yet?\nYou\u2019ve got it. I\u2019m a virgin. And a\nperpetually horny one at that \u2013 the\nonly sex I\u2019ve had is that involving a\npair of hands or a pair of lips. This\nisn\u2019t a religious choice by any means\n\u2013 more a personal one. I\u2019d like the\nchap I give myself away to, to be\ninspirational, passionate and under-standing. I\u2019d like him to respect me\nfor my talents, and connect with me\non an artistic level. Is this too much\nto ask for?\nPS Aaron S, I\u2019m flattered to know\nyou read my column first \u2013 I aim\nto make people remember me, for\nbetter or for worse. Evil is essential\nto make history what it is. I\u2019d be\nintrigued to hear your definition of a\nslut. Does she actually need to have\nsex, or just talk about it? What about\nthe promiscuous males you meet?\nQuestionsaretheretobeanswered.\nAnswers on a postcard to this one:\nwhat is your world when you are\nasleep or under anaesthetic?\nThe girl about town\nby STORMY WOODS\nInternet sex tests\nMy inbox is constantly inundated\nwith emails from friends telling me\nto take some sort of personal test or\nother. You know the deal \u2013 you tick\nthe appropriate boxes and discover\nthings that you already knew about\nyourself. They are generally rubbish and correlate really badly, with\none telling me I\u2019m an extrovert and\nanother that I\u2019m socially retarded.\nI\u2019d like to think that I know which\none I really am, but you never can\nbe certain.\nAn interesting part of this is whether one should be proud or ashamed\nthat the test labels you a nun or a\nslag. Is it something to be proud of\nthat so far you\u2019ve led a relatively\nsheltered sex life? I don\u2019t know. On\nthe other hand, should you be proud\nthat you\u2019ve put it about quite as\nmuch as you have? Admittedly, it\ncan be something to boast about (if\nyou\u2019re a guy). But are the people\nyou\u2019re telling really impressed by\nyour tally chart or are they just\npretending to be impressed because\nthat\u2019s what society expects?\nRecently, a new breed of test has\nbeen created. This one lets you\nset your own questions, and then\ntest how well your friends really\nknow you. I liked this new format,\nas you can make yourself look much\nmore interesting than you really\nare, and you get to set trick ques-tions. You also discover that people haven\u2019t really been listening\nwhen you\u2019ve been talking to them.\nCreate your own test now at www.\nquizyourfriends.com.\nI got an email from a mate the\nother day telling me to take a sex\nappeal test. It was cleverly worded\nto the extent that even if you normally can\u2019t really be arsed to take\nsuch tests, you probably would.\nSo I started filling in the test. It\nstarted off all nice and innocent\nwith name, age, etc. Then, \u201cWhat\nturns you on?\u201d with some potentially\ndodgy options such as golden showers and S&M. Next come \u201cHow often\ndo you masturbate?\u201d \u201cHow big is\nyour penis?\u201d \u201cHow many one night\nstands have you had?\u201d \u201cEver had\nbisexual feelings?\u201d \u201cEver had sex\nwith someone of the same gender?\u201d\nI answered all the questions hon-estly, then clicked the send button expecting it to tell me I have\na **% sex appeal. But no, a message appears saying \u201cyou have been\nfouled by \u2018name of friend\u2019, and all\nyour answers have been sent to\nyour friend\u2019s email address\u201d. Fuck.\nNow, there wasn\u2019t anything illegal or\ndepraved in my answers, but your\nsex life is a private domain. I was\nlike, bugger, I don\u2019t want my friends\nto know everything about my sex\nlife. I worried for a bit, but then\nthought to hell with it, it\u2019s nothing\ntoo serious, and your friends should\nunderstand you better if they know\nmore about you, shouldn\u2019t they?\nThen I noticed in the small print\nat the bottom it said \u201cdon\u2019t you feel\nviolated? Why not foul your friends\ntoo?\u201d So that\u2019s exactly what I did: I\nforwarded the email to other friends.\nI\u2019m not sure why I did it, I didn\u2019t really want to know about their sex lives\n(I reckon I know most of it anyway).\nI think I did it mainly as a way of\nextracting some kind of revenge, but\nit wasn\u2019t these people I should have\nbeen directing my revenge towards.\nI got an email the next day from\none of the recipients. All it said was\n\u201cwanker\u201d. Well, I guess I deserved\nthat. I spent the rest of the day trying to warn the rest of my friends\nfrom filling in the test.\nThe final twist is that you can\u2019t\nactually read the responses of the\npeople who filled it in... well, you can\nbut it costs you \u00a31.50 a time!\nMoral of the story: be wary of\ninternet sex tests.\nNeighbours\nContinues to surpass itself!\nThe Neighbours generation\nby RUPERT NEATE\n\n"

This, added to the\nfact that UCL had no medical school to back them up,\nmeans Imperial should really\nhave been crushed.\nOne can only begin to wonder why such a large college\ncouldn\u2019t manage to raise a\nfew more athletes from its\ndepths. Some blamed the\nlocation of the event \u2013 apparently Battersea is too distant\nfrom the South Kensington\nlibrary, where the majority of our beloved university seem to reside. Which\nbegs the question whether\nfaster times would have been\nrecorded had the winner won\na subscription to the New\nScientist along with all the\nepisodes of Robot Wars on\nDVD (or whatever superior\nhome entertainment system\nthey may be developing in\ntheir front room/lab).\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed\nby now, there was definitely\na medic flavour to the day\nand by pure coincidence the\nevents got underway under a\ncloud of medical controversy.\nFollowing the men\u2019s 110m\nhurdles, two final year medical students nearly came to\nblows arguing, not over an\ninfringement on the track,\nbut instead over the nature\nof treatment that ICSM star\nRichard \u2018Brad\u2019 Hutchinson\nrequired. Having witnessed\nthe event, in which Richard\u2019s\nlegs passed fluidly over the\nhurdles whilst two small but\nvital constituents of his pant\ncontent failed to do so, the\nmedics argued ferociously\nover whether stitches were\nrequired in Brad\u2019s heavily\nlacerated scrotum. They were\nindeed, and the lives of Brad\u2019s\nfuture children were saved.\nBut fortunately the day\nwasn\u2019t all about athletic inad-equacy;infactPippaCallegari\nshowed more invention in the\n2000m steeplechase than an\nImperial student in a physics\nlab. In front of the onlooking\nchairman of British Athletics\n(possibly), Pippa, as if from\nnowhere, created the \u2018drop\nand wade\u2019 technique in the\nwater jump section of the\nevent [see photo, below right]\nWehaveheardsincethatnews\nof this technique has spread\nlike wildfire around the athletics world, and already the\nworld famous Kenyan team\nhave introduced it into their\nwinter training schedules\nfor the coming season. Also\nsneaking into this event were\ntwo highly respected Union\nDeputy Presidents, Messrs\nRorke and Walker. Thanks for\nlending your support, but perhaps a touch more training\nwouldn\u2019t go amiss...\nBe that as it may, there\nwere actually some performances Imperial athletes can\nbe hugely proud of. Eoin O\nColgain did particularly well,\ncoming second in the 10,000m\nwith a time of 35 minutes and\n32 seconds (apparently on\npurpose because the medal\ngoes better with his beautiful\nsilver locks). David Xiong did\nwell to come second in the\n5000m in a time of 17min 4sec,\nElsa Carneau came second in\nthe women\u2019s high jump with\n1.50m, and the boys 4x400m\nrunners won in a time of 3min\n53sec.\nImperial Medicals heroes\nincluded Lydia Egan (best\nperformance 9.37m in the\nshot) and James Franklin\n(best performance 35.32m\nin the javelin) who both won\nthe heptathlon and decathlon competitions respectively.\nHamish Stutcliffe picked up\nsecond places in the 100m and\n200m and astonishingly won\nthe baton throwing competition with a distance of 12.45m.\nMark Willesdon starred in\nthe 400m, winning in 54.0sec.\nAngharad Care clawed back\na big lead to win the women\u2019s\n2000m steeplechase in 8min\n2sec, Lucy Perkins won the\nwomen\u2019s 10000m, and Claire\nKhaghani was second in the\ndiscus. Tom Amies and Pippa\nCallegari both finished second\nin the hammer, while Temi\nLampejo won both the triple\njump and the long jump.\nWe were lucky enough to\nhave UCL student Christine\nOhuruogu, a semi-finalist at\nthe Athens Olympics in the\n400m, to present the athletes\nwith their medals. Enormous\nthanks to everyone that\nturned up to compete and to\nsupport, and perhaps next\nyear we can get a better turnout to represent Imperial and\nhold onto our trophy.\nThe winning Imperial Medics team sit triumphantly at the end of the day with their trophy \u2013 apparently 30 years older than the modern Olympic Games\n\u25cf Continued from\nback page\nCaptain Max Marsden wins the men\u2019s discus with 35m Pippa Callegari shows off her water jump technique\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 26 May 2005\n4\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nNo need for branding\nclampdown\nI\nmperial College\u2019s rebranding exercises have been widely\ncriticised in this newspaper and elsewhere. Some students\ntake offence at the fact that the College crest, a symbol of\nquality and tradition, has been replaced by three very simple\nblue words on a white background. \u201cIt looks like something a\nfive-year-old could have designed,\u201d one student memorably\ncommented at the time. \u201cIt makes us look like a polytechnic,\u201d\nsaid another.\nNow it seems that the College is going one step further, raising objections about items of clothing that display the words\n\u2018Imperial\u2019, \u2018Imperial College\u2019 or \u2018IC\u2019 in a different, unsatisfactory manner. The Union shop could limit its sales to clothing\nthat only bears the new brand, but how many students would\nbuy it? The shop should be allowed to offer a range of clothing\ndesigned to students\u2019 tastes, some with the new brand, some\nwithout. As the President says, \u201cstudents are going to want fun\nthings,\u201d so the Union \u2013 and others \u2013 should be encouraged to\nuse the Imperial name in imaginative ways.\nCleverly designed items of clothing, such as those featured\non the front page, are walking advertisements for Imperial\nCollege, which will be seen by students\u2019 friends, families and\npassers-by. The vast majority of these items promote Imperial\nin a positive way to people of a similar age bracket, which,\nsurely, is exactly what the College wants.\nThe joy of... the Graduate\nStudents\u2019 Association\nMine\u2019s a pint\nYou\u2019ve just finished that tough last\nexam, all your classmates are going out\nfor a few drinks, so you decide to go with\nthem. Slowly the whole celebration is\nturning into a bit of session. On you go\nto a nightclub until 4am, then you grab\na nice juicy kebab on the way home and\nfinally get to bed around 5am.\nOK, so you\u2019ve woken up and slowly the\nmemories of the night before drift back...\nyou had ten pints too many, you were\nloud, you couldn\u2019t walk, you couldn\u2019t see,\nyou insulted your mates who insulted\nyou back, and you snogged that bloke or\nwoman you swore blind you\u2019d never go\nanywhere near in a million years.\nNow you\u2019ve got a headache from hell,\nyour stomach\u2019s about to explode and\nyou\u2019re still wearing clothes covered in\nlast night\u2019s kebab and vomit (but whose\nvomit is it?) Whatever \u2013 you still feel like\nthrowing up some more...\nAnd chances are you\u2019ll go through\nexactly the same thing again tonight or\nat the weekend.\nSo why do we drink?\nPeople drink for different reasons.\nAlcohol changes your mood, and some\npeople say it helps them to cope with\nstress. In the short term it makes you\nfeel happy (although, in fact, alcohol is a\ndepressant) and at the end of a long hot\nday, nothing hits the spot better than a\ncool beer or a glass of wine.\nDrinking can be fun \u2013 alcohol is not\ncalled \u2018the nation\u2019s favourite drug\u2019 for\nnothing. Some people use a drink to\nbecome more sociable and confident,\nbut too much can:\n\u2022 make you ill\n\u2022 give you a hangover\n\u2022 cost you a lot of money\n\u2022 cloud your judgement\n\u2022 encourage you to do things that are\nstupid or dangerous.\n\u2022 act as a depressant\n\u2022 make you fat\n\u2022 lead to serious health problems and, in\nextreme cases, even death.\nHow does alcohol get you drunk?\nAlcohol quickly enters the bloodstream\nand spreads all over the body. It partially\nremoves water from the parts of the\nbrain that deal with the way we think.\nIt makes you relax and lose inhibitions\n\u2013 a few drinks can make it easy to meet\nand talk to people. And if you\u2019re out with\nyour mates you become chattier, more\nconfident and convinced you are the funniest person on the planet.\nAlcohol also affects the central nervous system, which controls many of\nyour body\u2019s other functions \u2013 senses,\nspeech and sense of pain. So the more\nyou drink, the more your speech will be\nslurred and the more your sight will go\nfuzzy.\nWhen you drink alcohol, your body\ngets rid of more liquid than it takes in, so\nyou\u2019ll be dehydrated. This lack of water\nis what causes you to wake up with a\nthrobbing head.\nSo it\u2019s not all good news\nLosing your inhibitions and lacking coordination can be a tricky combination.\nWhen you\u2019re really tanked up and think\nyou\u2019re invincible, you\u2019re actually really\nvulnerable. It\u2019s easy to end up in situations where you could be in real danger,\nand not realise it.\nAnd we\u2019re not just talking about falling\ninto the road as you stagger home from\nthe pub. On a typical Saturday night, you\ncan be pretty sure that the A&E department of your local hospital will be full of\npeople affected by alcohol in some way.\nDrink makes you feel more confident\nand up for trying anything while your\nmates egg you on \u2013 things you\u2019d never\ndo normally if you hadn\u2019t had a drink\nbeforehand.\nA recent survey of 1000 women aged 16\nto 34 found that half the respondents had\ngot so drunk they didn\u2019t know how they\ngot had home, and a third had ended up\nhaving unprotected sex, putting them at\nrisk of HIV and other STIs.\nAnd though you\u2019d definitely, never,\never, drink and drive, are you absolutely\nsure that your mate driving you home\nshares your view? The more you\u2019ve\ndrunk, the less likely you\u2019ll be to check...\nor care.\nEven if you don\u2019t decide to walk home\non your own (which a lot of people do\nwith a few pints inside them, convinced\nnothing will happen) and get a cab, how\ndo you know you\u2019re getting into a safe\ncar if you\u2019re too drunk to check?\nIf you would like further information\non the effects of alcohol or if you feel\nthat your drinking habits are starting to\naffect your academic life, please don\u2019t\nhesitate to contact the Information and\nAdvice Centre for further help and infor-mation.\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into a\ncrisis. Make the Information and Advice\nCentre your one stop shop for all your\nwelfare issues.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nGraduates: get involved\nT\nhe Union\u2019s new Graduate Students\u2019 Association will be\nlaunched next Wednesday, before it officially exists. The\nbizarre situation caused by non-attendance at Monday\u2019s\nCouncil meeting will also lead to elections for posts that have\nnot yet been created. We believe the vast majority of the Council\nwould be behind these proposals and the Association will form\nas planned, but the whole thing still looks a bit of a mess.\nRegardless, Felix would like to encourage all graduate students to get involved \u2013 it is essential that this large, significant\ngroup has better representation and support within the Union.\nRead Sam Rorke\u2019s column, above, for details.\nFinding a way to \u2018Save Our\nSouthside\u2019\nS\nouthside Bar will be sorely missed by hundreds of stu-dents, staff and visitors to Imperial College, not least the\n1600 who have already signed a petition supporting the\ncampaign for a replacement bar to be created.\nWhile they are to be commended for their efforts during the\nbusy exam period, the \u2018Save Our Southside\u2019 campaigners need\nto come up with some viable proposals \u2013 and fast. It is all very\nwell to protest against something, but you will be taken much\nmore seriously if you can come up with a realistic alternative\noption. A classic example is top-up fees \u2013 the \u2018no to fees\u2019 message was heard loud and clear, but campaigners should have\nplaced equal emphasis on how else they would have solved the\nmassive financial problems faced by universities.\nThe Southside building itself is in desperate need of refurbishment and there is huge demand for space elsewhere on\nthe South Kensington campus, so it will be difficult to find a\nsuitable location for a new bar. Difficult, but not impossible.\nThe future looks bleak for Southside Bar in any form, but\nthe Union is beginning to take students\u2019 concerns seriously on\nthis matter following their antagonistic reaction to recent Felix\narticles and the 1600 signatures obtained so far. The College\nmay well follow.\nAll graduate students are warmly invited to join us for the historic launch event\nof the Graduate Students\u2019 Association\nnext Wednesday, 1 June, from 6pm in the\nUnion Concert Hall (second floor, Union\nbuilding, Beit Quad).\nThe event will hopefully be informal,\nsociable and fun, so to make the evening\ngo smoothly, there will be a free bar,\nbuffet and four-piece jazz band! You\ncan also expect to be told more\nabout the Association and how to get\ninvolved. We have a great keynote\nspeaker in Annie Thomas, Warden at\nGoodenough College, a 600-strong multinational residential community of\npostgraduate students based in central\nLondon.\nThe establishment of the Graduate\nStudents\u2019 Association (GSA) at the heart\nof the students\u2019 union has resulted from\nlengthy discussions between the graduate schools, Union officers and your\nstudent representatives on how to better represent and improve the lives of\nImperial postgrads.\nThe GSA will be headed by the Deputy\nPresident (Graduate Students), which\nwill be a full-time sabbatical position.\nEveryone who is currently a postgraduate student will be able to stand for\nelection to this post, and they will be\nelected by cross-campus ballot at the\nend of June.\nThe GSA will also enable postgrads\nto determine what needs to be done to\nimprove their time at College, and give\nthem the resources to achieve it; this is\nlikely to include establishing student-run\nsocieties that will receive funding from\nthe graduate schools and the Union, and\ncommittees to organise student events\nas they see fit.\nWe hope that you are able to join us\nin welcoming in a new era for Imperial\npostgrads.\n\u25cf State of the Union will return\nnext week\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nUNCLE SAM\nThe Information and Advice Centre\ncan be found in the east wing\nbasement of Beit Quad.\nTelephone 020 7594 8067\nor email advice@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

Films\nlike The Thing from Another\nWorld (1951), It came from\nOuter Space (1953), Them!\n(1954), and The War of the\nWorlds (1953) were reflections of the media and political hysteria surrounding the\napparent threat posed by\ncommunism.\nDuring the Cold War, mainstream science fiction films\nwere perfect for representing the deepest fears of the\npost-WWII generation. The\nCommunists took the form\nof giant radioactive red ants\nor alien space invaders,\nembodying the terror that\nAmericans felt from an invis-ible, unknowable enemy.\nToday, it appears that science fiction is undergoing\na bit of a comeback in the\nmainstream. With movies\nlike The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide\nto the Galaxy and Star Wars:\nRevenge of the Sith making\nmegabucks on the big screen,\nscience fiction appears to\nbe a successful genre that\nthe industry will find hard to\nignore. Spielberg\u2019s remake of\nThe War of the Worlds, arriving in July, looks set to be one\nof the biggest hits.\nSo why are we seeing this\nnew wave of science fiction?\nSci-fi movies are all about\nsuspending the audience\u2019s\ndisbelief. A science fiction\nfilm with obviously fake special effects quickly finds itself\nrelegated to the \u2018B-movie\u2019\ncategory. Recent advances in Computer Generated\nImagery (CGI) have made it\ncheaper to make convincing\nalternate universes.\nFor instance, the main reason for the return of Doctor\nWho on the small screen is\nthat the BBC can now afford\nCGI,sotheydon\u2019thavetohave\nplots hinging on actors dressing up in rubber suits bought\nfrom the local party shop and\npretending to be Zorgons\nfrom Alpha Centauri.\nThe CGI revolution began\nin 1975 when George Lucas\nestablished a new company\nIndustrial Light and Magic,\nwhich was to produce the\nvisual effects for his new\nmovie Star Wars (1977).\nLucas\u2019 maxim was \u201csound\nand music are 50% of the\nentertainment in a movie\u201d.\nThe success of the Star Wars\nseries has proved him right\never since.\nBut a criticism that has\noften been levelled at science\nfiction is that usually the\ncharacters are very poorly\ndeveloped and unrealistic.\nThis may be true \u2013 from\nBlade Runner to Star Wars:\nRevenge of the Sith, dialogue\nand characterisation have\nalways been weak points with\nsci-fi movies.\nHowever, what science fiction lacks in characterisation,\nit makes up for in ideas. We\nlive in a world when advances in technology are beginning to outpace our ability to\nkeep up with them. We live\nin a technological culture.\nAlthough recent films such\nas I, Robot and Minority\nReport are entertaining, they\nalso provide social commentary about the nature of our\ntechnological culture that\nother genres of film are unable to make. Another recent\nexample is Gattaca, in which\nsocial issues about genetic\nengineering are addressed.\nIn its ability to create virtual universes, where the only\nconstant is human nature\nand everything else is liable\nto change due to technology,\nscience fiction provides a valuable cultural commentary\nthat other genres of filmmaking are incapable of.\nIt is also the ultimate form\nof cinematic escapism. The\nmovies portray worlds as\ndistant from the day-to-day\nmonotony of modern living as\nwe can possibly imagine.\nBut some sci-fi purists\nremain sceptical: \u201cBig budget\n\u2018sci-fi\u2019 films have always been\npopular and tend to come in\nwaves,\u201d says Michael Wright\nof Imperial\u2019s Science Fiction\nsociety.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure science fiction\nas a genre is getting more\npopular. Many of the people\nwho will see Revenge of the\nSith in the cinema wouldn\u2019t\ntouch a sci-fi book, and many\nof the best sci-fi TV series\nhave been cancelled.\u201d\nWhat is undeniable, how-ever, is that at a time when\nthe movie industry is undergoing a bit of a recession, science fiction movies seem to\nbe the most bankable on the\nHollywood production line.\nSo don\u2019t be surprised if the\nfirst decade of the 21st century continues to see a science\nfiction renaissance.\n\u201cThese movies portray\nworlds as distant\nfrom the day-to-day\nmonotony of modern\nliving as we can\npossibly imagine\u201d\nScience fiction films like Revenge of the Sith and The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide have been\nsuccessful at a time when Hollywood is facing a box office crisis\nThis week at the Dana Centre\nExpand your mind for FREE, right next to\nImperial College\u2019s South Ken campus.\nControversial issues discussed in a thought-provoking, frank and entertaining way.\nInquiries and bookings:\nTel: 020 7942 4040\nEmail: tickets@danacentre.org.uk\nThursday 26th May, 7pm\nWireless Utopias 05: An open future for Spectrum?\nA debate on the future of wireless communications\nTuesday 31st May, 7pm\nPunk Science: the Albert Einstein experience\nA debate on the future of wireless communications\nFriday 2nd June, 7pm\nHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Science\nCould The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy inspire future inventions?\nHitchhiker Exhibition\nFor your chance to win two tickets to the The\nHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy exhibition at the\nScience Museum, just answer the following question:\nWho wrote the original book The\nHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy?

Now responsible for educational quality, he is the man to talk to\nabout SOLE, lecturer training, high hall\nrents and those humanities timetabling\nproblems.\n\u201cWe give a very good all-round education,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe take in top quality people, we push them and give them\nthe opportunity to develop and show\nsome innovation. At the same time, we\u2019ve\nbrought on possibilities of doing things\nsuch as humanities... there are around\n2000 students engaged in humanities\nevery year.\u201d\nTwo thousand students is certainly a\nnumber to be proud of at an institution focused around science, technology\nand medicine. But squeezing humanities classes into busy timetables has\nproved a major problem for Rawlings. In\nNovember, we reported that students in\na number of College departments were\nhaving to attend lectures and tutorials at\ntimes supposedly reserved for humanities classes and lunch breaks.\nRawlings accepts that the problem\nstill exists, and tells me that departments should be capable of arranging\ntheir activities around the \u2018no-go\u2019 areas of\nlunchtimes and Wednesday afternoons.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s essential that we have\nthe rules and everyone keeps to them.\nI have reported a few times over the\nlast six years to Senate [the College\u2019s\nmain academic committee] to say how\nimportant this is. When examples are\nbrought to me, they will be followed up,\nbut students do need to bring the examples to the union so they can be brought\nto me.\u201d\nHe mentions two recent incidents\nthat were brought to his attention by\nthe Deputy President (Education and\nWelfare) and have now been resolved. If\nyou have a similar problem, contact the\nDeputy President at dpew@ic.ac.uk.\nSOLE\nIt is surely essential that a university has\nan effective, large scale method of getting students\u2019 feedback on their lecturers\nand courses. SOLE, the Student OnLine\nEvaluation questionnaire, has been running for four years, and Rawlings is confident that after some teething troubles,\nthe system is working well.\n\u201cWe need to know the students\u2019 opinion\nof the education provision we supply,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cand that\u2019s basically the purpose of\nSOLE. When we get that information, we\nthen need to act on it.\n\u201cSOLE had a very bad start. When we\ndid our first online survey [four years\nago], the system just wasn\u2019t up to it. It\nwasn\u2019t robust enough, and it was possible to actually break into it. But the last\ncouple of years it\u2019s been running consistently with no problems. As you know, the\nresults go straight to the students\u2019 union\nas well, so there\u2019s great transparency.\u201d\nRecent levels of participation in SOLE\nhave been just under 50% \u2013 far higher\nthan Union election turnouts, and surely\nto be applauded with such a notoriously\napathetic student body. \u201cI think a turnout\nof 50% is OK,\u201d says Rawlings, \u201cbut I\u2019d like\nit to be more. Staff have got to remind\nstudents when SOLE is on, and students\nhave to realise that it\u2019ll help a lot of new\nstudents coming in... so I think the argument that \u2018I won\u2019t do it because it takes up\nan hour of my time\u2019 is pretty poor.\u201d\nI put it to Rawlings that perhaps more\nstudents would take part in SOLE if they\nhad evidence that things would change.\nIn my department \u2013 maths \u2013 we knew\nfor a fact that certain lecturers were\nconsistently given poor ratings, yet still\nturned up year after year to teach the\nsame courses.\n\u201cStudents have all the information,\u201d\nhe argues, \u201cand it\u2019s discussed at staff-student committees. It\u2019s up to student\nrepresentatives to make sure there\u2019s full\ndiscussion of SOLE results. But I can\nassure you that actions are made of SOLE\nresults. We\u2019re going to try to release some\nactions that have been taken.\u201d\nBut what if the department doesn\u2019t lis-ten? \u201cWell, students need to bring it to\nme through the Union. That\u2019s what the\nUnion\u2019s for, that\u2019s why we have represent-atives. People would have to give me evidence over, say, three years when a particular course has been badly taught...\u201d\nHe goes on to say that staff have to give\ntheir SOLE results when they are being\nconsidered for promotion \u2013 certainly a\nstep in the right direction, but perhaps\nnot far enough.\nLecturer training\nIn an ideal world, there would be little\nneed for lecturer evaluation systems such\nas SOLE, as the ratings would be high\nacross the board. So how does the College\nmove towards that goal and ensure that\nits lecturers can teach well and communicate clearly? I was interested to find out\nmore about the training they receive.\n\u201cFor many years, all our lecturers have\nhad to attend ten days of compulsory\nworkshops within their first three years\nwhile they\u2019re on probation. But we\u2019re\ntightening it up now \u2013 there is a certificate\ncourse run by the College\u2019s Centre for\nEducational Development and accredited\nby the Higher Education Academy, and as\nof this year all new lecturers have to go on\nthat [one year, part time course].\u201d\nRawlings believes that, in general,\nstandards of teaching and communication are high. \u201cThe Centre for Educational\nDevelopment was set up about five years\nago, and since it\u2019s come here it really has\npushed that aspect of educational development tremendously, giving staff training in all areas of learning and teaching.\u201d\nPersonal tutors\nRawlings is in charge of Imperial\u2019s submission to the Quality Assurance Agency\n(QAA), which will provide a thorough\nassessment of the College later this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a good look at things we\nthought we were a bit short on,\u201d he says.\nHe is reluctant to divulge what those\nthings might be, but eventually admits:\n\u201cThe students brought up personal tutor-ing. We have put out some more detailed\nguidelines on what we expect from personal tutors...\u201d\nAlthough many students only see their\npersonal tutor once or twice per year,\nand a considerable number have raised\nthe issue as a problem with the Union,\nRawlings believes that \u201cwe have a good\nsystem in place.\u201d\nHe continues: \u201cIf the personal tutoring\nbreaks down, the students can go and see\nthe senior tutor, and if the relationship\nwith the department breaks down, they\ngo to the College tutors and that\u2019s what\nhappens... On the other hand it would be\nnice to think that the relationship doesn\u2019t\nbreak down at personal tutor level. That\ncould be the student\u2019s fault or it could\nbe the staff member\u2019s fault. To get the\nrelationship to work, both sides have got\nto work at it.\u201d\nHall rents\nRawlings is chair of the Rector\u2019s\nCommittee on Student Residences, which\nmakes an annual recommendation of hall\nrents to the College. I put it to him that\nour hall fees are particularly high and ask\nhim where the money is going.\n\u201cWe compare the rents at Imperial\nwith those at other universities and other\nLondon colleges such as King\u2019s, UCL and\nLSE,\u201d he replies. \u201cThis data shows that\nthe rents at Imperial are comparable to\nthose at other institutions.\u201d\nHall rents are due to rise by an average of 6% for 2005-6, but Rawlings tells\nme that \u201cthe money from the rents is not\nbeing used to subsidise other projects.\nA simple calculation based on the rents\nthat are likely to be charged for a room in\nthe new Southside and the cost of building Southside would show that the rents\nwon\u2019t even pay back the capital cost of\nthat particular project, let alone subsidise\nother projects.\u201d\nApparently, the above-inflation rise is\nnecessary due to increasing costs in sectors such as construction, maintenance\nand cleaning.\nTo compensate for the temporary loss\nof all beds in Southside next year, around\n300 students will be housed in accommodation run by UNITE Housing. Hundreds\nof students in Liverpool experienced\nproblems with UNITE Housing in 2003,\nbut Rawlings is confident that the College\nhas made the right choice.\nLibraries... again\nGood library provision and adequate\nprivate study space are essential to a\nhigh quality education, but departmental libraries are being closed down and\nthe central library has been labelled \u201ca\ndump\u201d by its own staff.\nPredictably, Rawlings tows the party\nline. \u201cI think libraries are changing very\ndramatically, due to new journals, books\nand the ways students and researchers\nactually require information. For exam-ple, I think by 2008 over 80% of journals\nwill be e-journals. Libraries supply a lot\nmore advice than they used to, not just\nadvice on where to find a book on a particular topic, but advice on plagiarism, and\nsearching for literature. A small library\nhasn\u2019t got the skills to do all those things.\nThe best interest of the students is that\nwe have a good, up-to-date, well-serviced\nlibrary.\u201d\nHe insists that the levels of service will\nremain high when collections are transferred to the central library, as \u201cwe still\nhave librarians associated with certain\ndisciplines\u201d.\nPutting a question from a disgruntled\nUnion officer, I ask what the QAA would\nthink of departmental libraries being\nshut down and having their books thrown\naway. Rawlings laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sure some\nbooks that haven\u2019t been used for 15 years\nhave been thrown away! I mean, any\nlibrary will throw some books out, [but] I\ncan\u2019t believe a book that\u2019s regularly used\nwill be thrown out. You\u2019ve put the ques-tion, you\u2019ve got the laughter.\u201d\nStriking a balance\nRawlings is obviously fond of Imperial\nCollege and proud of the standards it\nhas set. He believes that an Imperial\neducation \u201cwas hard work then [in his\nstudent days] as it\u2019s hard work now.\u201d He\ntells me that the courses are difficult,\nbut \u201cnot so difficult that someone can\u2019t\nbe organised enough to play some sport\nor belong to a club and still get a good\ndegree. It\u2019s just a case of managing your\ntime properly. It\u2019s about striking the right\nbalance, and the vast majority of students\nstrike it.\u201d\n\u25cf Next week: what\u2019s happening\nto Wye? We talk to Sir Leszek\nBorysiewicz, the Deputy Rector\nTHE FELIX INTERVIEW felix@ic.ac.uk\nA laughing matter: Professor Rees Rawlings (left), finds humour in a discussion about libraries with Dave Edwards in the Faculty Building. For the uninitiated, it\u2019s the shiny new building that looks like it\u2019s\nmade from lego bricks and makes a low whistling sound in strong winds\n\u201cSOLE had a very bad\nstart, but the last couple\nof years it\u2019s been running\nconsistently with no\nproblems\u201d\nPHOTO: WILLIAM TURNER\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a good look\nat things we thought we\nwere a bit short on... the\nstudents brought up\npersonal tutoring\u201d\n\u201cImperial isn\u2019t so difficult\nthat you can\u2019t play some\nsport or belong to a club\nand still get a good\ndegree\u201d\nThe Legendary\nWye Commemoration Ball\n24th June \u2013 make a date!\nThe Wye Commem Ball falls this year on Friday 24th June, and promises\nto be bigger and better than ever. The evening starts with a champagne\nreception and 3 course dinner, accompanied by a string quartet and a\nmagician, all in a marquee on Withersdane Lawn. After dinner there will be\na band and firework display, and the fairground (dodgems, waltzers etc.) will\nbe open until 4am. This year also sees the introduction of the Shisha Tent\n(variety of flavours). Music will vary throughout the night (string quartet with\ndinner, band playing classic covers, Kiss FM\u2019s the Firin' Squad, other DJs\nto be confirmed - hip hop, dance, cheese, chart, rock - the lot). Between 6\nand 7am, breakfast will be served and the Survivors\u2019 photo taken.\nThis year it would be good to see some of the other Imperial College\ncampuses down at Wye, as this may be the last Commem Ball. Also next\nyear Wye converts completely into Imperial\u2019s business campus, so if you\u2019ve\nbeen wondering whether there really are sheep and inbreds everywhere\nthen now\u2019s your last chance! We\u2019ll look after you and we can guarantee that\nyou will have a fantastic time. If enough London students want to attend, we\nare prepared to lay on a return coach or two, so get your mates together\u2026\nTickets for entertainment only are \u00a340, or \u00a365 to include dinner, champagne\nand Red Bull. Shisha is included for both tickets. For further info or tickets\ncontact wye2005@hotmail.co.uk\n\n"
