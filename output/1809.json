    "content": "FRIDAY 21ST OCTOBER 2022\n21\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nbetter strategy of organising so that when I wanted to\nwrite I could just write and not focus on other things.\nIt also taught how to write in terms of understanding\nyour ideas and focusing in on them. I really enjoyed the\nvideo content \u2013 it was run by a guy named Tucker Max,\nwho\u2019s a best-selling author \u2013 he was really good at engaging people wanting to write.\nI was super excited to have that pro-ject; I had a few other projects to do as\nwell, like my podcast, but I wanted to\nwrite a book. It took shape over time\n\u2013 originally it was called \u201cFrom Full\nto Fulfilled\u201d. I was trying to answer the\nquestion: \u201cwhy do some people have\nsuch amazing successful lives and others\ndon\u2019t?\u201d I wanted to discover that, so I\nwas thinking about my life and the successes I\u2019ve had. As the book developed and grew, the\ntitle changed to Side Hustle & Flow, because I started\nto realise that what I\u2019d become really good at is being\nable to work full-time and also dedicate time to music\nand other side projects that were fulfilling to me outside of work. I knew it was a model that other people\ncould benefit from, because most people who want to\ndo something like that would have to work too.\nThat\u2019s the nature of life, it\u2019s difficult to be able to sustain yourself from music or art alone; obviously, some\npeople can do it, but very few. I also realise that when I\ntalkaboutasidehustle,notallofthemaremoney-mak-ing. You don\u2019t have to go out and make money from\nyour music, but if you enjoy it then why not do it in\nyour spare time? If you want to get better at time man-agement, setting goals, and paying more attention to\nwhat\u2019s happening in life, then you could benefit from\nthe principles in the book.\nI basically just use myself as a guinea pig in the entire book, explaining how I started in music in the last\ntwenty years, and how I was able to work on many different jobs and figure out the \u201cecosystem\u201d that works\nfor me. I\u2019m not saying you would follow this exactly,\nbutIthinkthere\u2019sdefinitelyalotofcluesinthesuccesses that I\u2019ve had, and people can see me as a role model,\none who started from scratch. If you really want to do\nsomething you can; there are a lot of people who want\nto have that balance in life.\nWould you describe it more as a self-help\nbook, an autobiography, or a bit of both?\nYes, it really falls under self-help, psychology, business,andit\u2019salsoamemoir.Thatlastpartisimportant because, in this type of \u2018prescriptive non-fiction\u2019,\nthere really is nothing new. Everyone is basically saying\nthe same thing; even in the SCAD Media course, the\nfirst thing we learned is that nobody has anything new\nto say. These principles are tried and true; being adept\nat time management, budgeting your time, writing\ndown ideas and goals \u2013 that\u2019s not new information.\nMy story is new to people, and something that I\nobviously know well, so that\u2019s what makes the book\ninteresting. It\u2019s chronicling my life \u2013 or a part of my\nlife \u2013 and it\u2019s nice to be able to see other examples. I\ntalk about Roger Bannister, who was a track star in the\n1950s.Peoplesaiditwasimpossibletorunamile\nin under four minutes because your body would\ngive out, you\u2019d have a heart attack, but he did it\nin 3 minutes and 59 seconds. For years people\ndidn\u2019t accept it and then someone does it and\na few months later someone else is also able to;\nBannister opened up the possibility that it could\nbe done.\nThe same with the Wright brothers; people\nsaid we\u2019d never be able to fly, but people have been\nthinking about flying forever. Leonardo Da Vinci had\nflying machines back in the 1400s, then in the early\n1900s the Wright brothers were able to start it, and\nnow we have people travelling all over the world faster\nthan ever with jets.\nBeingabletolookatapersonandseethatsomething\ncan be done is very inspiring and motivational, and\nparticularly to see people of colour and other ethnic\nbackgrounds \u2013 maybe someone like yourself \u2013 can be\nmotivational to subgroups, although of course people\nof races other than mine may also benefit. This is why I\nwantedtogetmyselfloopedinwith\nthese tried-and-true principles.\nYour side hustle is being a\nmusician; can you speak\nabout that and about your\nday job?\nMy day job is Vice President of Digital & Operations for a small global beauty company. I\u2019ve\nbeen in the world of beauty for the past decade, and\npreviously worked with L\u2019Oreal group for about eight\nyears, in footwear with Skechers corporation, and did\nother non-profit jobs. I also played music on Holland\nAmerica Cruise Line for a while, so I\u2019ve had a lot of\ninteresting experiences.\nAs a vice president I have the joy of working in a\ncross-functional, cross-country team, so I have teammates in Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, and\nthe U.S., among others. It\u2019s nice to see how the rest of\nthe world lives and how we\u2019re becoming more connected through platforms like Zoom. It\u2019s very exciting and\nmy job is fascinating; a lot is expected of me, but I love\nthe owners of the company, and there are a lot of op-portunities. We\u2019re creating things that have never been\ndone before with new technologies.\nIt uses my creative mind, which flows over into my\nmusic, which has expanded over the last twenty years. I\nstartedoutasasingerandkeyboardist,andbeyondthat\nstarted writing songs. I\u2019ve won awards in that area, like\nthe John Lennon songwriting contest, and two world\nsongwriting awards. Then going into producing, out of\nnecessity \u2013 making my own records, producing for other people, and doing background vocal arrangements\n\u2013 progressing out of my first band The Moon Crickets;\nmoving into making music under my own name \u2013 Cliff\nBeach \u2013 and then doing some collaborations, one of\nwhich was with a group who I helped release an LP under my record label California Soul Music. That song\nhas almost a million streams on Spotify now, and we\ndid that all on our own.\nI didn\u2019t start out in music, but now we have distribu-tion, licensing, songwriters, TV shows, commercials,\netc. While expanding on the music side, I also have a\npodcast based on music called Deeper Grooves, and\nwe\u2019re going into Season 5 in January. We\u2019ve been doing some video interviews for the radio station; I have\na radio show every Friday night at 9pm Pacific time, on\n88.5FM SoCalSound.org \u2013 I get an hour to listen to\nmusic. People send me music from all over the world\nto play, I get to meet fans and interview them; it\u2019s been\nexciting.\nI\u2019m also the house band leader on Josh Gates Tonight,whichisonDiscoveryChannelandDiscovery+;\nwe\u2019ve just done two seasons of that, and hopefully will\ncome back again. Josh\nisgreatandsuperhum-ble and has plugged us\nso many times through\nthe show. I had no idea\nyears ago thinking\nabout doing music that\nI would have all these\nthings.\nLuckily with work I have autonomy of my schedule,\nso I did a whole tour while working, travelling along\nthe West Coast from Vancouver all the way down to\nSan Diego.

    "content": "curity in their life the same way that I have, but I\u2019ve\nbeen lucky to be able to say \u201cI want to do this\u201d and find\na way to do it. Now we\u2019re working on new albums; I\u2019m\nworking on a jazz project right now, hopefully it\u2019ll be\nrecording before the end of the year. I put one foot in\nfront of the other, and there\u2019s some labels that want\nto work with us now, so I take every opportunity as it\ncomes.\nHow do you keep your motivation high\nwhen juggling lots of different tasks and\njobs, especially those that are more tedious\nor don\u2019t have clear deadlines?\nOnce you\u2019ve learned what I call the \u201cside hustle success habits\u201d I think you\u2019ve got to figure out how\nto understand that. You have to be comfortable with\nambiguity when deadlines are shifting. Sometimes life\ndoesn\u2019t give you a full structure and you have to create\na structure for yourself, and that\u2019s what I did. In times\nwhen I was unemployed \u2013 I talk about this in the book\n\u2013 I still woke up every day, looked for work, and set\na schedule; eating at certain times and exercising and\nother things, because it\u2019s good to keep at least a loose\nstructure in your day.\nI look at my calendar each night, so I have an idea of\nwhat the flow of the next day is going to be, and look\nat my entire week on Sundays, when\nI\u2019m off, because it helps me understand the structure of what the week\nis going to do. Not everybody does\nthat, maybe less than 10% of people\nplan even that much, and less than\n1% plan to a high level of detail. I\nlive and die by my calendar, which is\nhelpful for me, but that\u2019s part of my\npersonality.\nIt can be tough to stay motivat-ed, especially with so many negative\nforces around, so I read and listen to a lot of self-help\nbooks and audio programs, because that helps keep me\ngrounded. I try to surround myself with good people\ntoo, and I realise that I\u2019m not going to be able to do\neverything,certainlynotallatonce.WhenIreaddown\nthe laundry list of things I\u2019ve done, people are like \u2018do\nyou have more than twenty-four hours in a day?\u2019 which\nis impossible, and others think I give 110 percent,\nwhich is not possible either.\nMotivation and inspiration are all around you. You\njust have to be attuned to it, and sometimes what happens is we\u2019re so distracted by things that don\u2019t matter\nbut take up time. Time-vampires, like television or\nsocial media, which can be such a drain. You have to\nreally safeguard your heart and mind from negativity\nbecause there\u2019s so much in the world. There\u2019s positivity\ntoo, but it doesn\u2019t really get out; especially in news and\nthe media there\u2019s a saying: if it bleeds it leads.\nEspecially with Covid, I had so many friends melting down because they were watching this ticker clock\nof people dying and getting sick. I just totally blocked\nall of that out during that time and\nhyper-focused on internal projects\nbecause I knew if I sat looking at\nthe doom and gloom, then that\nnegativity would permeate into my\nspirit and soul and slow me down.\nIt wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t cognisant that\npeople were in trouble; I was aware\nofit,butifIkeptitintheforeground\nand looked at it all the time, then it\nwould have stopped me from working on the book and\nother projects.\nCould you elaborate on the main pros and\ncons of having a side hustle?\nThe pros are that you\u2019re probably going to find fulfilmentthatyoudon\u2019tgetfromwork.Somepeople\ndohavefulfillingwork,particularlyifyou\u2019readoctoror\nnurse and saving lives, but I don\u2019t think most of us at\ncorporate jobs feel like we\u2019re saving lives. If you work\nsomewhere or are good at something that isn\u2019t fulfill-ing, or where there isn\u2019t a lot of\ngrowth opportunity, you should\nget that outside work. Work can\nonly have so many layers, and\nthere may be other layers to you\nthat aren\u2019t being tapped into.\nEven if it\u2019s not a side-hustle\nto make money \u2013 say you love\nanimals, why not volunteer at a\nshelter? In the book there\u2019s a guy\nwho loves to salsa dance, and I\nsay if you love it, you should do it\nas much as possible. The main thing is finding out what\nyou love, and not everybody knows, but if you do then\nwhy not do it as much as humanly possible, as much\nas you can afford to? There are so many non-working\nhours that people don\u2019t utilise. We often talk about\n\u201cspending\u201d time, but really people should think about\n\u201cinvesting\u201d time, which is different: getting a return\non that investment and effort. People don\u2019t necessarily\nthink about life that way, sometimes they don\u2019t think\nat all, and are so stuck into a routine. Having these\nside-hustles breaks you out of that routine.\nThe cons are that it takes time, and it takes sacrifice.\nNot everyone wants to work full-time and then come\nhome and work full-time on something else; that\u2019s a lot\nofhours.I\u2019vebeensingledoingthisandhadgirlfriends,\nbut I haven\u2019t been married or had kids, so that would\nbe much harder. A baby can only be selfish by nature;\nthey cry, need to be changed, fed, held, so especially for\nsingle parents \u2013 my heart goes out to them. That\u2019s already a second job, and can be fulfilling, but when the\nbaby\u2019s asleep, getting two hours where one of them is\nspent tinkering with something they really want to do,\nwhether it\u2019s writing a book, making recipes to share online, whatever it is, they can do that.\nThat\u2019s the beauty of the side\nhustle and flow, because in that\nflow you get to decide how little\nor how much you want to do. The\nproblem is we often have this \u201call\nor nothing\u201d mentality, so we end\nup not doing anything. Like, I have to be able to do\nmusic full-time or, if not, then I give up music altogeth-er. There\u2019s no in-between there, but flow allows you to\nhave a grey area instead. Life isn\u2019t black and white; even\nif you\u2019re working on music an hour a day, that\u2019s better\nthan not doing it. Out of twenty-four hours in a day,\none hour really isn\u2019t that much. If you sleep for some\nof that, maybe there\u2019s sixteen or eighteen hours, still\nan hour isn\u2019t that much. Maybe you only spend half an\nhour \u2013 that\u2019s still something. If you feel you want to do\nsomething, find time for it.\nDid you self-publish your book or send it\nout to publishers?\nIwas going to self-publish the book when I started\nwriting \u2013 that\u2019s all I knew. But as I was writing the\nbook, I found some editors that helped clean it up, and\nthe book was shaping up pretty good, so I thought, let\nme send it out to some agents. People seemed interested in it, so I paid someone on Fiverr, and we sent it out\nto 350 agents and publishers.\nThrough that process, over a couple of months, we\nwhittled it down to one indie publisher: The Black\nSpring Press Group in the UK, under Eyewear Publishing, who ended up taking up and releasing the book.\nCongratulations and thank you to Todd, who runs it,\nand his entire team; they\u2019ve been instrumental. I\u2019m\na first-time writer and published author, and in hard\n\u201c\nYOU HAVE TO\nSAFEGUARD YOUR\nHEART AND MIND\nFROM NEGATIVITY\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n22\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n\u201c\nWE OFTEN TALK\nABOUT \u201cSPENDING\u201d\nTIME, BUT REALLY\nPEOPLE SHOULD\nTHINK ABOUT\n\u201cINVESTING\u201d TIME\nCredit: Envato Elements\nBOOKS\n\n"

    "content": "What defined Boris Johnson towards\nthe end of his premiership was his\nastounding refusal to accept that he\nhad to go. I remember sitting with\nmy mouth literally open wide and my\nhair bunched in my hands,\nreading how he was yet to\nstand down as the total\nnumber of ministers in\nhis government who had\nresigned was reaching\nclose to 50. He was a man\nwho tore up every\ngood faith practice\nhe could whilst\nin office, ignoring\nthe ministerial code and\nnot re-appointing an ethics\nadviser, and above all just\nsimply couldn\u2019t admit that he had\nbeen wrong. It turns out that this\ntrait is actually shared by much of\nthe parliamentary Tory party, but\nthis time in a way seemingly too\ncovert to be picked up by most. As\nwe all now know painfully well, the\nUK governmental system works by\nelecting a ruling party, of which there\nis a leader who acts as Prime Minister\nwhilstthepartyisincharge.TheTories\nwon the 2019 election, not Boris\nJohnson, and we all know full well that\nLiz Truss didn\u2019t win anything at all. It\nis therefore the fault of the party, not\njust Truss, that the country is in the\nstate it\u2019s in. Yes, Liz Truss and Kwasi\nKwarteng had some off-piste ideas\nabout how to run the British economy,\nbut those ideas were signalled long\nbefore Truss had even got through\nthe first round of the leadership race,\nand any MP worth their salt should\nhave realised the potential havoc she\ncould wreak before having backed her.\nThe papers over last weekend very\nwidely spent their analysis columns\nlooking at how the\nTories might save\ntheir party\u2019s skin by\nousting Truss already,\nand bringing in their\nthird leader within\nthe space of the year.\nThese would be the\nsame MPs who got\nTruss to the last round\nof the leadership race. A\nprominent idea apparently\nbeing discussed by plotters is to install\nRishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt\non a joint ticket to \u201cunify the party\u201d,\ncompletely glossing over the fact that\nMordaunt backed Liz Truss into the\nfinal round. The MPs who let Truss\ninto power are as much to blame for\nthe current state of affairs as anyone\nelse, and it\u2019s absurd that they are\nconsidering getting another one of\nthem into power as if that would wipe\nthe slate clean. Liz Truss was clearly\na shit candidate from the get go,\nand most people could see that, but\nplaying politics supplanted selecting\nfor competency. Tory MPs need\nto suffer the consequences of that.\n* Since this editorial was written,\nPrime Minister Liz Truss has\nresigned.

Kicking Matt\nSkiba back to Alkaline Trio, he joins\na now deep-in-the-Kardashian-clan\nTravis Barker and a silver-haired Mark\nHoppus who has just beaten cancer.\nThe prime line-up is back. Exciting\nstuff. Or is it? Because as of now, it all\nseems like a simple but largely effective marketing\nploy. Of course, it is understandable that the band\u2019s\nmarketing team will shove the news down the feed of\nanyone with an atom of pop punk in their browser\ncookies, but on top of that, we have got a world tour\nannounced, a questionable single released and a new\nmysterious album incoming. Let\u2019s go step by step.\nblink-182 World Tour \u2013 Not Quite Putting the Punk\nin Pop Punk\n\u201cYay, blink is coming to town!\u201d \u2013 those were the\nlast words pronounced by every blink-182 fan before\nchecking how much the tickets for the show were selling for. In London, both dates in October 2023 have\nminimum price tags of \u00a380 \u2013 exorbitant sums just to\nsee 50-year-old Tom and Mark barely\nhanging onto their vocal cords. Prices\nare no different for the American dates,\nthe bulk of the tour, something which\nhas caused outrage on social media, especially among millennials who will be\nspending their Sunday brunch money\non tickets anyway. This value-increasing\ngamble might turn out to be favourable\nfor the trio, as they have already been\nable to add second dates to London, Glasgow, Manchester, Toronto and Chicago, and are even headlining the now sold-out When We Were Young festival in\nLas Vegas along the likes of Green Day, The Offspring\nand 5 Seconds of Summer. This goes to show that classic pop punk bands no longer need affordable entries\nto concerts \u2013 their fanbase has already aged enough to\nbe working 9 to 5s.\n\u2018Edging\u2019 \u2013 Silly Lyrics Will Not Work with Mall\nInstrumentals\nblink-182 wrote \u2018Anthem\u2019. And \u2018Happy Holidays,\nYou Bastard\u2019. And \u2018Ben Wah Balls\u2019. They know how to\nwrite a funny song. And \u2018Edging\u2019 is a horrendous attempt at recreating that goofy humour from almost 30\nyears ago. What made the childish lyrics work in the\npast were the raw vocal delivery and the unapologetic\nriffage that propelled the song forward. This new single has none of that. Tom and Mark sound as plastic\nas the past two (sleeper) albums by the band. Travis\u2019\ndrumming is surprisingly dull, even being replaced by\nsome clapping samples at a point. And our propeller,\nthe riff\u2026 is simply not there. Fans were expecting the\nshort and sweet riffs to be back with Tom\u2019s return, but\nit seems like he left them with Angels & Airwaves. I\nwill keep my hopes up for the album that has just been\nannounced, though. DeLonge has recently tweeted\nthat \u2018Edging\u2019 was a \u201cperfect way to remind [us] of the\nfun again\u201d, but that the new project will have a more\n\u201cprogressive and elevated\u201d sound \u2013 which makes me\nthink of their artistic prime with Untitled in 2003.\nWill the Generation X pop punk legends step out of\ntheir Peter Pan syndrome and give us more mature\ngems such as \u2018I Miss You\u2019 and \u2018Down\u2019? Or will Tom\u2019s\ncomeback deliver more versions of \u2018Edging\u2019?\nDevo\u2019 is inspired by various forms of Orthodox chant\nincluding Znamenny Chant (a form of long Russian\nChant) and contains swelling melismatic passages\nwhich continually rise and fall, growing longer as they\nstretch endlessly into the soundscape. One almost\nhopes it doesn\u2019t end. Together with these traditional\nmelodic forms, large textured harmonies overlap with\neach flowing melody. As the piece progresses, the texture only becomes larger until it reaches a large fortissimo climax towards the end in six-part harmony and\nwith each voice part in their upper ranges reaching towards the heavens. The music pulls you in and draws\nyou along; its subtlety and homophony, unlike Byrd\u2019s\npolyphony, gives it clarity and purity which complements the text.\nLocation plays a big part in choral music. It is common practice to see large choirs perform in concert hall\nvenues and the like but when it comes to sacred music\nof any religion, a place of worship is what is always re-quired. Sacred music was written for such places; written to bring peace in prayer or bring life to scripture.\nEven when not singing in a sacred capacity, why deny\nsuch privilege to the audience who may find comfort\nin this music at any point in time? When one sits in\na church to listen to Rachmaninoff\u2019s All-Night Vigil,\nregardless of religious preference of acknowledgment,\none can feel a sense of awe and reverence. It tells the\naudience that this is more than music, this is an expression of faith and an attempt to discern the mystery of\none\u2019s religion.\nThe final aspect which brings life to choral music is\none which takes a little history knowledge to truly appreciate \u2013 namely, the context and timing with which\nit was written. Rachmaninoff completed his Vigil in\n1915 during the height of Russia\u2019s involvement in the\nGreat War and was performed in aid of the war wound-ed. Loss and anguish filled the streets of the then Russian Empire and it would no doubt have been a great\ncomfort for many to hear such music sung not only as\na deep and meaningful prayer to God and their behalf,\nbut also as a means to aid their fellow citizens who suffered at the front lines and at home. But what brings\ngreater sadness to this piece is its fate in what would\nfollow shortly after in 1917.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, religious music and\nthe Orthodox faith itself faced censorship and persecution with religious music being banned, churches\nclaimed by the state and many Orthodox clergy executed or imprisoned. Francis Maes of the University of\nGhent wrote in his book, A History of Russian Music:\nFrom Kamarinskaya to Babi Yar, that \u201cno composition\nrepresents the end of an era so clearly as this liturgical\nwork\u201d. One cannot help but feel a sense of true sadness\nat the idea that this masterpiece would have been heard\nfor just two more years before it would never be heard\nagain within its own churches or its country for over\nfifty years.\nThe Vigil held a special place for Rachmaninoff; in\nconversation with his biographer, he had requested\nthat the fifth movement of the Vigil, the \u2018Song of Simeon\u2019 or \u2018Nunc Dimitis\u2019, be played at his own funeral.\nEvery movement in this work has the power to take us\nonanemotionalrollercoaster,andRachmaninoffknew\nhow such emotions could be evoked within his music.\nHowever, the last movements present us with a different emotion. The thirteenth and fourteenth movements of the work recount the resurrection of Christ, a\ntime of hope and celebration, and the final movement\nis a prayer beseeching God\u2019s eternal protection. For\nmost of the final movement the voices seem to flutter\nand dance while reaching soaring heights. The texture\nis also vast (reaching up to seven-part choir) providing\none with a sense of fortification and strength. It seems\nfitting to end the work on such a hopeful and strengthening note given that this work as a whole had survived\nSoviet censorship for over fifty years and is still enjoyed\nand appreciated as it was meant to be: with reverence\nand an open heart.\nThe long-awaited return of Tom DeLonge might not be all sunshine and roses\n\n"

    "content": "Many people view viruses and bacteria as invisible things responsible for many different diseases such as\nCOVID-19 and the flu. However, they\nalso have many applications in both industry and research. This invisible labour is usually overlooked by the general\npublic and not appreciated enough, especially in the research area. This article\nshowcases three examples in which viruses and bacteria are essential. Without\nthem, no research would be possible and\nour quality of life would definitely be di-minished.\nRestriction endonucleases\nBacteria have bacteriophages, which\nare viruses that exclusively target the\nbacteria. Bacteriophages are extremely effective at their job, being able to\nwipe out an entire colony of bacteria\nin a matter of hours or even minutes.\nSimilar to humans, bacteria have a kind\nof \u201cimmune system\u201d that confers protection against bacteriophages. This\n\u201cimmune system\u201d relies mainly on a\nparticular group of enzymes called restriction endonucleases. Bacteriophages\ncause infection by inserting their DNA\ninto bacteria, taking advantage of the\nbacterial replication machinery and producing more copies of themselves. The\nfunction of restriction endonucleases is\nto chop down the viral DNA, neutralis-ing it. Scientists succeeded in extracting\nseveral restriction endonucleases from\nwild bacteria decades ago. These restriction endonucleases were used to cleave\nparticular DNA sequences and attach\nthem to plasmids. Plasmids are small\ncircular fragments of DNA that can be\ntransferred between bacteria\u2014 if the\nplasmid contains the gene, this would\nbe expressed in the bacterium recipient\nof the plasmid. The ability to create customised plasmids has had a huge impact\non molecular biology research because\nit allowed us to alter the behaviour and\nstructure of cells for different research\npurposes, as well as to efficiently produce large quantities of a particular protein of interest.\nReverse transcriptase\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nhasarguablybeenthemostemployedlab\ntechnique worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic. An astonishing feature of PCR is that it can amplify almost\nnegligible traces of genetic material into\namounts large enough to be analysed.\nFor SARS-CoV-2 detection, PCR starts\nwith the synthesis of DNA from the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from\nthe patient sample. DNA synthesis is\ncarried out by reverse transcriptase. This\nis a unique enzyme almost exclusive to\nretroviruses like HIV. In retroviruses, reverse transcriptases are used to integrate\nviral DNA into host DNA, causing\ndire diseases like AIDS.\nHowever, scientists have\nmanaged to convert this\nenzyme with pathogenic\npurposes into one of the\nmostusefulandimportant\ntools in molecular biology\u2014and save millions of\nlives by limiting the spread\nof SARS-CoV-2.\nThe Agrobacterium\nsystem\nDepending on the con-text, the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens\ncan be harmful but also\nhelpful. In farming, it is\na parasite, the culprit of\neconomic losses in crops\nsuch as grapes and horse-radish. The operation plan\nof Agrobacterium tumefaciens is simple. It inserts\ntumour-inducing plasmids (pTi) into plant cells,\ncausing them to start\nsecreting hormones that\ntrigger cellular proliferation. This causes\nthe formation of \u2018plant tumours\u2019 called\ncrown galls in areas where the bacteria\nhave infected the plant. Like tumours\nin animals, crown galls start taking large\namounts of nutrients from the plant.\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens takes advantage of this situation by absorbing part\nof the nutrients that arrive at the crown\ngall. This allows the number of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to multiply. More\nbacteria means more \u2018modified\u2019 plant\ncells and hence bigger tumours. However, in plant science, Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens is the Holy Grail of genetic\nengineering in plants. Scientists have removed the viral genes that cause tumour\nformation but kept intact the secretory system used by the bacteria to insert\nplasmids into plant cells. Now, we have\nan affordable, flexible and relatively simple method to modify the genetic composition of plant cells. This allows us, for\nexample, to create a transgenic plant in\na matter of weeks.\nBacteria and viruses play a major role\nin the research field. In this article, we\nhave only mentioned three but there are\nthousands of examples more. The 20th\ncentury was the Golden Age of making\nbacteria and viruses, or parts of them,\ninto useful tools for research. At present,\nweareenteringintoaveryinterestingera\nwhere we focus more on modifying and\nperfecting the current tools than finding\nnew ones. It seems that we have exploited most of the bacteria and viruses out\nthere. However, estimations indicate\nthat we have not even discovered 5% of\nall the different viruses and bacteria that\nlive on Earth. Who knows what biological systems with unimaginable applications are out there awaiting us to be dis-covered? It is just a matter of time\u2026\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nInvisible helpers in research:\nbacteria and viruses\nStaff Writer Wang Guo delves into the applications of these micro-organisms\nSCIENCE\nReverse transcriptases from retroviruses have been harnessed for use in PCR\nCredit: Envato Elements\n\n"

    "content": "Director Lee Haven Jones\u2019 debut Welsh-spoken\nfeature hopes to do for the Welsh film industry\nwhat the Manic Street Preachers did for Welsh language back in the 90s. Merely 30 years on, this political act of filmmaking puts a new image of Wales on\nthe map. Gone are the narrow depictions of grey, dull\nfarmland, instead this tale is set in the glamorous country estate of an MP, Gwyn (Julian Lewis Jones) and his\nfamily, steeped in the rich tradition of Welsh folklore.\nThe story revolves around Cadi (Annes Elwy), a\nlocal barmaid who arrives at the family home to help\nGlenda (Gwyn\u2019s wife played by Nia Roberts) cater\na dinner party for Euros (Rhodri Meilir), a business\nassociate of Gwyn, and their neighbour, farmer Mair\n(Lisa Palfrey). Gwyn and Glenda\u2019s motivation? Buy\noff Mair\u2019s land to mine for minerals. Also present are\ntheir two sons who have returned to the family home.\nGuto\u2019s (Steffan Cennydd) heady drug fuelled lifestyle\nin London has caught up with him, and Gweirydd\n(Sion Alun Davies) has left the medical field, under\nmysterious circumstances, to train for a triathlon.\nThe film starts as it means to go on, with the\noverstimulating, almost ASMR-like sounds, of a\nworker drilling into the land before being struck down\nby some force of nature. These noises crop up against\nthe sparse soundtrack as the camera lingers on the\nfamily preparing for the feast. Glenda peels off a face\nmask, Gweirydd cuts himself whilst shaving his pubic\nhair - often with the omni-observant Cadi watching in\nsilence. As Cadi helps Glenda cut food, the too close\nfor comfort shots of the knife hint at the gore to come.\nSimilar elements build up a perfect level of tension to\nlet the final act ensue. However, the last thirty minutes\nfeel like a fever dream hurtling all too quickly to a\nfinish.Bizarremontageflashbacksruintheatmosphere\nslowly built up in the first hour or so.\nRetribution is dealt - punishing the characters\u2019\n(occasionally one dimensional) flaws.

Here again we\nhave two sides of the coin: the rich in their beautiful\nhome - no longer fit for Glenda\u2019s mother\u2019s farmhouse\nkitchenware - hoping to feed off the land, versus Cadi\u2019s\nservice position and Mair\u2019s farm. The division of the\nfilm into chapters, each signposted with prophetic\nwriting, perhaps detracts a little from the subtlety of\nthisallegory-leadsusalongCadi\u2019sownfeast-supported\nwith expertly placed twists she helps right the balance.\nHowever, watching this film in the aftermath of a\nsummer of climate crises from floods in Pakistan to\nwildfires in the UK, it is even clearer that it transcends\njust an allegory about wealth and class but also about\nthe environment. Cadi\u2019s strong connection to nature -her knowledge of mushrooms, mysterious dirt marks\nfollowinghereeriemovementsandhervisceralreaction\nto preparing rabbit meat for the feast - puts a question\nmark over her identity. Is she Mother Nature, a forest\nspirit, an animal? The film doesn\u2019t quite satiate all these\nanswers, and is perhaps not as fast paced for those who\nare usually fans of the genre, but is well worth a watch\nfor those who enjoy the fun of pondering over a movie\nwell after it\u2019s over.\nThe Feast (Gwledd)\nFRIDAY 21ST OCTOBER 2022\nEdited by: Jonah Hewett\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 15\nSorcha Owens Film Writer\nFilm Review\nDirector:\nStarring:\nYear:\nLee Haven Jones\nWales\nAnnes Elwy, Nia Roberts, Julian Lewis\nJones\nCountry:\n2022\nFilm Society\nWeekly Screening\nHereditary (2018)\nImperial Film Society\u2019s are screening their\nHalloween Special next week.

    "content": "The 1975 are the marmite of mid (in both senses\nof the word) 2010s indie - they had a chokehold\non teenagers after releasing their self-titled debut album in 2013. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the hits from\nthat album: \u2018Girls\u2019, \u2018Chocolate\u2019 and \u2018Sex\u2019 are positively\ninfectious. That\u2019s the sound that\nthe new album Being Funny In A\nForeign Language captures. To top it\noff, Jack Antonoff, the mind behind\nBleachers and producer to megastars\nlike Taylor Swift and Lorde, took\nthe helm of producing this album\ntoo. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong to\ndouble check you read the headline\nright at this point. The album seems\nlike it should be perfect \u2013 the sound\nthat made the band with the careful hand of Antonoff\ntweaking and teasing every idea into harmony with\nevery other. BUT! You missed a crucial detail. You\nforgot to consider that Matty Healy, forever excruciating and eternally irritating, wrote this album.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one album track I don\u2019t like\nthe sound of. \u2018Happiness\u2019 is a danceable hit from the\noff, \u2018Part Of The Band\u2019 has some beautiful imaginative\nstring parts, and \u2018Wintering\u2019 is a more stripped back\nstory of going home for Christmas. All these tracks are\nenjoyable to listen to, I even love some of them. The\nproblem comes on the fourth or fifth listen when you\nstart actually listening to the words.\nLike all 1975 albums, Being Funny starts with a\ntrack titled \u2018The 1975\u2019 and it\u2019s only the second line here\nwhere the irritation begins - \u201cI\u2019m sorry\nif you\u2019re livin\u2019 and you\u2019re seventeen\u201d.\nHealy describes every \u2018The 1975\u2019 track\nas the bands\u2019 \u201cstatus update\u201d and Being\nFunny\u2019s sets the scene for this album. It\n\u201cdescribes the cultural, social, political\nenvironment\u201d that Healy and the rest\nof us are living in. Those are Healy\u2019s\nwords and reasons, but all that line\nseems to be to me is angst for the sake\nof angst (as does the whole album). It\nappealstothesamegroupofpeoplethatthefirstalbum\nhooked, however now those people probably spend all\ntheir time on Twitter rather than Tumblr. This isn\u2019t\nan attack on those people, it\u2019s an attack on Healy\u2019s\npessimism.\nToday,it\u2019stooeasytolookatalltheworld\u2019sproblems\nand despair, but there is no way to combat any of the\nissues facing the planet by giving up. It would be a\nblessing if this was the meaning Healy was aiming for\nin comparison to problems that he later emphasises.\nHe goes on in later songs to dissuade listeners from\ncalling out older generations for problematic views.\nThis occurs in \u2018Wintering\u2019, what could be a nostalgic\ntrack about visiting home for Christmas, seeing people\nfrom your childhood, and how they and your town\nhave changed. It is for the most part, then Healy feels\nthe need for a lecture \u2013 \u201cI just came for the stuffing,\nnot to argue about nothing\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem\nwith Healy being preachy if he wasn\u2019t so problematic\nhimself. He seems to want everyone to listen to him\nwithout having to listen to anyone else.\nLaden in levels of irony, Healy\u2019s lyrics are sometimes\nfunny and hit the mark, however for the most part,\nconsidering the persona he portrays of self-entitled\nself-proclaimed genius, they fall flat and just create an\nawkward listen. This is devastating as, musically, Being\nFunnyisaconsistentlyconfidentandimaginativealbum\n\u2013 most definitely helped by Antonoff\u2019s production.

I went with a certain expectation: that I would\nsit on my segment of church pew, straight-faced with\na sense of purpose that I would actually try and make\nit through fifteen movements. Yet, by the time it had\nreached the sixth movement, \u2018Bogoroditse Devo (Hail\nMary)\u2019, I noticed the tears beginning to roll down my\ncheek. Rachmaninoff had written something truly\nbeautiful to me; I had found peace within that brief,\nfleeting moment of music that held me and brought\nme a comfort I didn\u2019t know I needed.\nThis is, of course, not the first time I have been reduced to a hideous and emotional wreck by choral\nmusic and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. However, I\npondered what in a choral music piece emotionally\ndestabilises me so \u2013 what allows it move to me to tears?\nIn the case of Rachmaninoff\u2019s All-Night Vigil, there are\nseveral reasons why it can evoke in me such a multitude\nof emotions.\nFirst, the music of the choral tradition \u2013 particularly\nwith regard to liturgical music, or music written to be\nperformed during a religious ceremony \u2013 is shaped by\nthe text to which it is set; the text in this case is taken\nfrom the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. Delivered\nby the angel Gabriel, the text celebrates how Mary is\nfull of grace and the Lord is always with her. As a result,\nshe will bear a child who will be the saviour of every\nsoul. When reading the text, one can imagine it being\nread in a calm and measured voice that is inoffensive\nand compassionate. Rachmaninoff\u2019s setting for such\na text does not only that but feels personal and intimate as if the choir is whispering to you, comforting\nyou, holding you closely. This feeling is amplified and\nappreciated when one compares the music to other settings of the same text. English Renaissance composer,\nWilliamByrd\u2019ssetting,forexample,feelsrigidandpays\nlittle regard to the text itself; it presents like a show of\nhis skill as a master of Renaissance counterpoint rather\nthan someone who listened to the voice of the text.\nThis feeling of intimacy and comfort bleeds into Rachmaninoff\u2019s music setting and shapes how he wrote it.\nThis means that the second component which brought\nsuch emotion was the music itself. The \u2018Bogoroditse\nThe 1975 return with danceable past-its-best-before-date angst\nHow Choral Music Can Move You to Tears\nWritten by Gilbert Jackson Music Writer\nFelix Recommends\nA look into the emotional power of Rachmaninoff\u2019s All-Night Vigil\n\n"

Not everyone\nexperiences such a painful process. Each party\nresponds differently. It should be never forgotten that\na divorce affects more than just the couple. No matter\nhow and where the things were left, there are always\nchildren, whose experiences are miserable. Emotional\nand behavioural issues are common reactions to fights\nor separation between parents. This story written and\ndirected by Florian Zeller is not an exception.\nWe\u2019re first introduced to this successful and happy\nman, Peter, played by Hugh Jackman. He\u2019s at the apex\nof his life, getting his dream deal, married to a beautiful\nwoman, Beth, played by Vanessa Kirby, with whom he\nhas a newborn son Theo. Everything goes according to\nplan,untilhisex-wifecomesforafavour.Their17-year-old son, Nicholas, is troubled: he\u2019s missing school, acting weird and aggressive; and she doesn\u2019t know what to\ndo with it, he needs a father figure. They separated on\ngood terms, so Peter doesn\u2019t mind helping out; at the\nend of the day it\u2019s still his son.\nLater on we find out how Zen McGrath, who\u2019s playing Nicholas, is not over the divorce the same way his\nparents are. He did not move on, he is still suffering,\nand he is in pain. Peter does not want his son to fail,\nthat\u2019s what he\u2019s been taught, so he will do anything\nwhat\u2019s in his power to fix the boy. Although it first\nseems that Nicholas is just going through a phase, like\nevery other teenager, it\u2019s not the case. We soon find out\nabout self-harm he\u2019s inflicting upon himself to cover up\nthe pain. Everyone\u2019s on edge, they don\u2019t know how to\nact, which is distracting and causes even more harm.\nThis story and the idea behind it are powerful and\nimportant, however the way they are presented is poor\nand misleading. During the screening I found myself\nconfused how during some of the controversial scenes\ndepicting toxic relationships between the generations,\neveryone was laughing. It\u2019s sad to see dramatic moments being considered a joke, especially when you\nrelate to some. This is due to poor writing and directing at moments. The cast is not huge, but it is talented.\nAlthough the actor playing Nicholas, Zen McGrath,\nshowed strong acting skills, his character was lacking\nsomething. He felt weird and underdeveloped.\nThe film has its heart in the right place. The idea is\npowerful - it is necessary to discuss these topics in so-ciety. But throughout its duration the film felt like it\nwas only made to win awards, and failed to properly explore the subject matter. Maybe Florian Zeller tried to\nfollow the same path as he did with The Father in 2020.\nDepression is an extremely sensitive topic which everyone should be familiar with. The best this film can do is\nraise awareness for this horrible disorder. Take care of\nyourself and your mental health, and do not be afraid\nto seek help.\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio\nDirector:\nStarring:\nRelease:\nGuillermo del Toro\nUSA/Mexico\nGregory Man, Ewan McGregor, David\nBradley, Ron Perlman\nCountry:\n9th December 2022 (Netflix)\n\u201cOh boy, oh boy, oh boy!\u201d do I want to tell you\nabout Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio. The possessiveness of the title is well deserved. Reimagining\nthe story that has been told for years through generations and making it so unique, making it stand out is\nnot something any director could do. This film was in\ndevelopment for about 15 years and is very personal to\nGuillermo del Toro, as well as his mother, who sadly\npassed away a day before the world premiere. You can\nsee the passion and love in every part of Guillermo Del\nToro\u2019s Pinocchio.\nThis story is not the same as other adaptations.\nGuillermo Del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio is set in 1930s fascist Italy. The ongoing World War I is the reason Geppetto,\nvoiced by David Bradley, loses his son. After years he\ndevelops a drinking issue and in one of the drunk episodes out of grief he carves and assembles Pinocchio.\nThere\u2019s no magic involved; it doesn\u2019t have a beauty to\nit, it looks dark. That\u2019s why an angel looking figure, a\nmystical forest creature, shows up and gives it life, to\nhealGeppetto\u2019ssoul.WealsomeetSebastianJ.Cricket,\nvoiced by Ewan McGregor, who just moved into the\ntree Pinocchio was made from. We can see how perfectly imperfect Pinocchio\u2019s body is: nails, rough edges,\nholes and cracks; this story is not the polished one that\nwe\u2019re used to.\nGregory Mann managed to properly deliver a voice\nfull of the just-born excitement and thirst for experience that Pinocchio has. As soon as he gets out in\nthe world, he\u2019s not accepted. Some are scared, some\namused, others see how they could use him. Pinocchio\ndoes not know how to behave, which weakens his relationship with Geppetto and leaves him vulnerable to\nthose who seek to exploit him. The story shows how\neveryone desires Pinocchio to be something they want,\nsomething else. It is not\na story about disobedience to encourage kids\nto behave better; it is one\nfrom which everyone\nshould learn acceptance\nand care.\nGuillermo Del Toro\u2019s\nPinocchio is a stop-mo-tion animation film, and\nif you think that you\ndon\u2019t like the style, just\ngo for it anyway. It is one\nof the best stop-motion\nworks in the past decade.\nAlthough the nature of\nPinocchio might seem childish, this one is somewhat\ndark and bold at times, but still remains funny and\nbeautiful. As Guillermo Del Toro said, \u201cThis is not a\nmovie made for kids, but kids can watch it if their parents talk to them\u201d.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to change to be loved and we should\nbelovedexactlyasweare\u201disthemainpointofthisfilm.\nNo matter what and who is surrounding you, don\u2019t feel\ntheneedtosuppressyourself.ThisPinocchioisnotlike\nany other, it\u2019s fresh, it\u2019s progressive, it\u2019s real. Guillermo\nDel Toro\u2019s Pinocchio is a must watch, especially during\nthe holiday season when it comes out.\n\u2b51\u2b51\u2b51\u2b51\u2b51\nCredit: BFI/Getty Images\nThe Father, The Son and the Laura Dern\nCredit: BFI/Getty Images\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n5\nEdited by: Jamie John\nAngie Lo\nShrey bohra (Tech)\nScience\nA whole new world: quantum computing\nQuantum computing, a seemingly\nbizarreandimpossibleconcept,has\nthe potential to transform the way data\nis processed. It is rapidly emerging with\nactive investors from a variety of sectors,\nthe key players being pharmaceuticals,\nchemicals, automotive, and finance. In\n2021 $1.4 billion (more than double the\namount invested in 2020) was invested\nin funding start-ups focused on research\nin quantum technology. The basis of\nthis futuristic technology is rooted in\nconcepts such as superposition, entan-glement, and interference, using these\nto perform computations. However, we\ndon\u2019t need to understand this to understand the magnitude of impact it can\nhave. Quantum computing can be applied in every field, from computational\nresearch in chemistry, DNA sequencing,\ncreating climate models, and AI and machine learning, and to more day-to-day\napplications like traffic control, public\nfinancing, and weather prediction.\nSo, what makes a quantum computer so different and powerful to a classical computer? It all comes down to the\nmostbasicunitsofdatastorage,abitina\nclassical computer and a qubit in a quantum computer. A classical bit can take\none value at once - either 0 or 1 - whereas a qubit can have two values at once; it\nis the superposition or the combination\nof 0 and 1 where both values contribute\nequally. Qubits thus pack more information than a bit. To make this clearer\nwe can consider an example: if a system has N bits, it can store N values of\ndata, however if it has N qubits, it can\nstore 2N data values. Similar to a classical computer each operation is done\non every single data value, i.e., on all 2N\ndata. This can accelerate calculations by\norders of magnitude which enable quantum computers to solve more complex\nproblems (involving a large number of\nvariables interacting in different ways)\nthan a classical supercomputer. While\nnot every problem is suited to quantum\ncomputing,someusecases\u2013forexample\ncryptography \u2013 are perfectly positioned\nto take advantage of the unique characteristics of quantum computers.\nQuantum computers approach such\ncomplex problems such as DNA sequencing by linking data points in mul-ti-dimensional spaces to identify a pat-tern. This allows quantum computers to\ntackle problems which cannot be solved\nfeasibly by current supercomputers, as\nconsidering every interaction of every\nvariable requires unrealistic amounts of\ncomputing resources.\nThe computing speed can be under-stoodconsideringanexample:ifwewere\nto look for one data point in a list of a\ntrillion data points and each data point\ntook approximately 1 microsecond to\nlook at, a classical supercomputer would\ntake 1 week to compute this, whereas a\nquantum computer would take 1 sec-ond.Thisimpliesthatquantumcomput-ers have a clear dominance over classical\ncomputers and experiments that aim to\nprove that are commonly referred to as\nquantum supremacy.\nNeedless to say, quantum computing\nis an incredible feat of science, but how\nclose are we to realising this? Despite\ninvestment from Governments and tech\ngiants such as IBM, Google and Microsoft, quantum computers still remain\nrudimentary.\nThe first breakthrough was\nclaimed by IBM\nin 1998, when\na 2-qubit NMR\nquantum computer was made.\nToday quantum\ncomputers operate on a scale\nof 10s to 100s\nof qubits, with\nIBM\u2019s 127 qubit\nEagle processor\nbeing the largest\nquantum computer created.\nHowever, this is\nstill a relatively\nweak comput-er. To put into\nperspective, the\nworld\u2019s most\npowerful supercomputer, the Frontier,\nhas a 75 TB (8x1012 bits in a terabyte)\nprocessor. Google claimed to have\nachieved quantum supremacy in 2019\nwith its Sycamore (53 qubit) processor\nwhich performed tasks that a supercomputer would take 10,000 years to\ncomplete in 200 seconds, but this was\nchallenged by a team of scientists at the\nInstitute of Theoretical Physics at the\nChinese Academy of Sciences who used\nclever algorithms to do the same in a\nsupercomputer. It is safe to say that supercomputers are not yet obsolete and\nhigh-performance computing is continuing to develop to support computing\nin different fields. The possibility of a\nhybrid computing approach is also being\nexplored.\nWhat makes it so difficult to build\na super quantum computer? There are\ntwo main issues that scientists face in\nthe implementation of quantum theory:\nthe issue of isolating a qubit unit and the\nimplementation of the entanglement of\nqubits. In simple words quantum entanglement is a phenomenon by which two\nparticles are connected, and thus, an operation done on one particle affects the\nother in the same way. A popular idea\nfor the implementation of a qubit to use\nthe spin of electrons. In theory, this is\nideal as electron spin is a quantum entity and obeys the basic requirements\nof a quantum computer. However, it\ncan easily be destroyed, and needs to be\nisolated, which requires the use of exotic materials such as superconductors\nand necessitates operation at cryogenic\ntemperatures. It is also difficult to balance the isolation and the interaction\nbetween the entangled entities. The results of the Nobel Prize (2022) winning\nexperiments conducted by John Clauser,\nAlain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger on\nentangled quantum states have opened\nmany doors in quantum information\nscience to potentially make it easier to\napply this on a larger scale.\nAn Imperial based start-up ORCA\nComputing, building off the research\nof Prof. Ian Walmsley, is also at the\nforefront of the field and has claimed a\nbreakthrough in making it more accessible and commercially viable by creating\na 4-quibit machine using photons.\nAs the father of modern-day computing Alan Turing once said: \u201cWe can only\nsee a short distance ahead, but we can\nsee plenty there that needs to be done.\u201d\nSwathi Mahashetti Tech Writer\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia Commons\nIBM offfices in Amsterdam\n\n"

    "content": "(Continued from previous page)\nSocial inclusion\nThe Times and Sunday Times Good\nUniversity Guide finds that Imperial\nperforms poorly when it comes to social\ninclusion. The College has dropped two\nplaces this year, from 112th in 2022,\nto 114th in 2023. Only Oxford and\nCambridge perform worse by the social\ninclusion metric this year, occupying the\n115th and 116th spots respectively.\nOver a third of Imperial\u2019s admissions\ncome from private schools with non-grammar state schools still representing\nless than half of admissions. These\nfigures mean Imperial ranks sixth out of\n133 for independent school admissions,\nand third from bottom for state school\nadmissions.\nImperial performs significantly better\nthan other universities when assessed by\nthe \u201cBlack achievement gap\u201d. According\nto The Times and The Sunday Times,\nthis is \u201cthe percentage point difference\nbetween the proportion of firsts and\n2:1s attained by white students and\nthose from black, Asian, mixed or other\nethnic minority backgrounds\u201d. The value\ntakes no account of disparities between\nethnic minorities. Imperial ranks second\nin the country by this metric, with a\nBlack achievement gap of -2.5%, an\nimprovement on last year\u2019s value of\n-3.8%.\nStudent satisfaction\nThe Guardian University Guide\nquotes results from the 2022 National\nStudent Survey (NSS) to measure\nstudent satisfaction. The NSS is an\noptional survey sent out to all final-year undergraduates. Imperial ranks\nthird for teaching satisfaction (85.8%\nsatisfaction) and eighth for course\nsatisfaction (83.1%). Overall, student\nsatisfaction is at 82%, a 2% drop on last\nyear.\nThe Times and Sunday Times Good\nUniversity Guide draws together the\nresults of multiple NSS questions to\nformulate its own student experience\n(%) and teaching quality (%) scores.\nThis year, Imperial has tumbled down\nthe teaching quality rankings, falling\nfrom 28th place last year to 71st .\nHowever, this corresponds to only a\n2.8 percentage point drop in teaching\nquality score (from 77.7% to 74.9%).\nThe College performs similarly for\nstudent experience, dropping from 3rd\nplace to 12th, with a 2.1% year-on-year\ndrop in student experience score (from\n79.3% to 77.2%).\nThe Times and Sunday Times Good\nUniversity Guide provides a detailed\nbreakdown of student satisfaction with\nteaching quality, finding that geology\nstudents are the most satisfied (86.8%\nsatisfaction), and physics students are\nthe least satisfied (59.8% satisfaction).\nThe Complete University Guide uses\nratings from whatuni.com, which asks\nstudents to rate their universities out of\nfive for four different student experience\nfactors. It draws from the much smaller\nsample of students who have chosen to\nreviewtheirinstitutionsontheWhatuni\nwebsite. Imperial ranks 88th out of\n95 universities overall, with a 3.8-star\noverall rating. \u201cLecturers and teaching\nquality\u201d get a 3.6-star rating (87th/95\nuniversities) and Imperial College\nUnion gets a 3.4-star rating (78th/95\nuniversities). The College\u2019s student\nhalls fare better, receiving a 4-star rating\n(19th/62 universities).\nResearch quality\nImperial tops The Times and Sunday\nTimes Good University Guide and The\nComplete University Guide for quality of\nresearch, beating out the University of\nCambridge and LSE, which rank second\nand third respectively, in both guides.\nThe Guardian\u2019s guide does not include\nresearch quality metrics.\nThis comes on the back of an\nexceptional performance in the most\nrecent Research Excellence Framework\n(REF) publication. REF 2021 ranked\nImperial first in the UK and found\nthat the College provides a greater\nproportion of \u201cworld-leading\u201d research\nthan any other UK university. The REF\nwas established in 2014 and takes place\nevery six years, assessing the quality\nof research performed by UK higher\neducation institutions. The REF success\nfollows the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhere experts from the College played\na central role in influencing government\npolicies across the world.\nFRIDAY 21ST OCTOBER 2022\n4\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nCarolee Schneemann was an artist who didn\u2019t fit in\nany boxes at all. To give you an idea of her work,\nshe pushed the boundaries of feminism to their ut-most, invented \u201ckinetic theatre\u201d and explored themes\nlike sexuality and nudity, all after being expelled from\nuniversity for \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d. Before I went to Body\nPolitics, the first major exhibition of her life after her\ndeath in 2019, I hadn\u2019t heard of her, but I won\u2019t be forgetting my experience anytime soon.\nThe exhibition began, relatively blandly, with pieces clearly inspired by Abstract Expressionism, melding\ncolours and materials, and hinting at her love of classical music. The paintings became sculptures involving\ncontrolled burning processes, and then moved swiftly on to delve into her explosion on the experimental\ndance and performance scene in New York.\nAs I walked around, I could hear a jarring thump\nthat was coming from a mop banging an old-fashioned\nTVandoccasionalshrillbeepingfromwhenspectators\ngot too close to the exhibits. Passing a small group, I\noverhear a man enthusiastically explaining one of Schneemann\u2019s pieces and then a gallery guard who looks as\nthough he is about to have a nervous breakdown (he\u2019s\nright by the banging mop).\nNot long after that, I come across a video of a group\nperformance called \u201cMeat Joy\u201d, which involved, among\nother things, falling raw fish, feather underwear and\nthrown paint. The performers began alone and gradually became one seething mass in the middle of all this.\nA telegram she sent after its premiere sums it up:\n\u201cBEAUTIFUL FRENZY WILD MEAT JOY TRIUMPH OUR LOVE COVERS PARIS\u201d.\nIwasquiterelievedtofindacollectionofbooksfrom\nher library \u2013 something more welcoming, I thought.\nThe title Male Fantasies jumped out at me. A moment\nlater, I walked decidedly past a darkened doorway\nwhich had a little sign warning that room contained\nintimate footage of Schneemann having sex with her\npartner.\nIn doing so, I missed the point of her work: to confront raw feeling without flinching and to make anything ordinary into something beyond definition. Still,\nit was slightly sickening for me \u2013 which goes to show\nhow powerful Schneemann\u2019s work is. Nothing was off\nthe cards for her; she wanted to show her audiences\neverything.\nHer art and her body were indistinguishable by the\nmiddle of the exhibition. In \u2018Body Collage\u2019, she was\nfilmed coating herself in wallpaper paint and molasses before moving through large amounts of shredded\npaper in different ways. A little later, I discovered she\nmade a kinetic theatre piece to provoke more public\nanger about the war in Vietnam. Then things began to\nramp up: two rooms called \u201cVulvic Space\u201d, containing\nphotos of eyes, ears, and\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 all opposite\na large collection of suspiciously stained tissue paper.\nIt\u2019s easy to superimpose your own experiences onto\nan art exhibition to make it more relevant to you, but\nthat was completely impossible here. I experienced the\nexhibition in a type of dazed nausea, both cut off from\nwhat I was seeing and strongly affected by it.\nAfter an hour and a half of this, I was left with an\nappreciation of someone who lived in a very different\nworld, who seemed to have no self-doubt and a complete devotion to following her desires. I wonder what\nshe would have thought of someone like me turning up\nblind to \u2018Body Politics\u2019 \u2013 would she have dragged me\nMoral Turpitude \u2013 Exposed to the passions and perf\nReviewed by Anonymous Arts Writer\nBody Politics\nWhere?

As we work through the flow of going\ninto the digital Kindle version, then releasing the audio\nbook in January \u2013 which is being edited now by Tim\nHall from Eleven Nine Studios in LA \u2013 then the paperback will go out.\nIt\u2019s been great working with them, they\u2019ve been\naround since 1985 and have several imprints, worked\nwithtonsofgreatauthors.They\u2019vebeenagreatsupport\nand I learned a lot \u2013 it\u2019s cross-cultural and everyone has\ndifferentexpertise.Attheendoftheday,themaintake-away from working with this publisher is they really do\nchampion and believe in the power of the written word\nand power of authors. They saw me as an author before\nI even had a published book, so that was cool. I\u2019m just\nhappy that the book is out in the world and people can\nhold and see it.\nAre you likely to try and publish another\nbook after this one?\nIhaven\u2019t thought that far along because we\u2019re still in\nthe cycle of publicity and promotion for this book,\nbut I\u2019ll definitely leave the opportunity open. I\u2019ll learn\nmore through life and probably have more to say, but\nthe writing of a book is a daunting process. I understand now why many people that want to do it don\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s hard, and we went through about ten rounds of edits before eventually having the book fully done.\nI got to a point where I was so over listening to what\nI had to say, then when I had to read it for the audio\nbook and I\u2019m listening back to it, I just never want to\nhear my voice again. I will probably do another one,\nbut I\u2019ll allow some space for it, as I did with the first\ncouple of books that didn\u2019t pan out, in around 2014. It\ntook me until 2022 to release this book because I wanted to have more life experiences. So, nothing yet [on\nanother book], but I\u2019m keeping the possibility open.\nThe second time round will always be easier than the\nfirst, because you\u2019ve seen a lot of the process already.\nThere were some steep learning curves, and things I\u2019d\ndo differently, and that happens with music and other\nthings as well. So, we\u2019ll see.\nAssuming you did go to university, where\ndid you go and what did you study there?\nIwent to Berkeley College of Music in Boston, which\nis one of the foremost conservatories in the world for\ncontemporary music. I studied Music Business Management and Vocal Performance, and because I studied Music Business, after doing my tour with Holland\nAmerica for about a year I came back to land and went\nto school in Malibu. For my Masters in Business Administration I went to Pepperdine University, which I\nthinkisoneofthemostbeautifulcampuses,maybesec-ond to those in Hawaii, but very beautiful in the rocks of Malibu, and right on\nthe beach. I also spent about six months\nabroad in France, at Rouen Business\nSchool studying International Business.\nI\u2019ve been fortunate and privileged to\nbe able to attend multiple universities,\nand I think Higher Education is important and people can definitely benefit\nfrom that, but I understand it\u2019s expensive and not everyone is able to go. There\nare other ways to learn online now \u2013 more than ever\nbefore \u2013 and I think people should go for apprentice-ships. I don\u2019t see it as much, but it\u2019s good to just work\nfor someone who\u2019s doing what you want to do and\nlearn from them.\nTo our student readers, what advice would\nyou give about university life and work in\nretrospect, and particularly those students\nthat enjoy taking part in lots of different\nthings outside their given course matter?\nIt\u2019s great for university students that you\u2019re already in\nschool, but school only gets you so far. It\u2019s really a\nplatform and a launching pad, what it doesn\u2019t necessarily have is practicality. For example, what you should\ndo if you want to be a musician, is when you get out of\nschool have an album produced and ready to go and\nsell. That would be the best approach, and I don\u2019t think\nschool is set up to really do that. No matter what you\ndo, you\u2019re at a time when you should be learning and\ndoing as much as you can. You\u2019re still finding yourself\nand there are things about you that you won\u2019t love, but\nat the end of the day, your world will expand the more\nyou touch and reach and try new things.\nStudents who think \u201cI\u2019m only going to focus on\nschool\u201d are going to have a disadvantage to others who\nsay \u201con the side I\u2019m going to try five or six other things\u201d,\nbecause you never know whether that seed you plant\ntoday is going to become a mighty tree tomorrow.\nWhen you\u2019re in university, one of the freest times of\nyour life \u2013 for a lot of you parents are putting money\nbehind it so you don\u2019t really have to work or do other\nstuff \u2013 you owe it to yourself to do as much as you can.\nThere will be a part of you that wants to party and have\nfun, and there will be time for that, and to network and\nmakegreatconnectionswithpeoplethatmaylastalife-time. But also take time to do internships and try your\nhand at different careers and firms, and maybe even\nstart your own businesses on the side.\nMy ending thought would just be to always start\nagain; if you fall off at any point, just get up and\nstart again as quickly as pos-sible. I\u2019ve been sober now for\nalmost three years (in November), and when you\u2019re\ngoing through the different steps in that, if for some\nreason you end up having a\ndrink, then you just talk to\nsomeone and get back on the\nwagon, and it\u2019s the same with\nlife. Babies learning to walk\nwill fall and then get back\nup and try again. With New Year\u2019s resolutions coming\nup, some people will fall off after the first mistake they\nmake and just give up \u2013 that \u201call or nothing\u201d mentality again. To properly [succeed] you need to first have\nmany false starts, like I had four before actually getting\nmy book out. Starting is definitely the hardest thing to\ndo, so start earlier, and if you put intention behind it\nand put a plan together, you can execute that easily and\nend up with an output or deliverable when you\u2019re done.\nStart to finish, a project is always successful, no matter\nwhat the outcome of it is.\n\u201c\nTHERE ARE SO\nMANY NONWORKING HOURS\nTHAT PEOPLE\nDON\u2019T UTILISE\nCredit: Envato Elements Credit:\nAim\nKumpusiri\n\n"

This is where the\nbook is particularly effective. Beach faced hardship\nin pursuing his dreams, and so can dish out his advice\nfrom a position of experience. As a student, certain\npieces of advice stood out to me. Beach writes about\nhis numerous failures in his career; losing out in the\nLennon Awards, his toils with his first band The\nMoon Crickets, and so on. About these things, Beach\nsays, \u201cexperience is invaluable;\nfailure is its best teacher\u2019.\u201d And\nso with that, I\u2019m going to try\nand take my future mistakes\nin stride.

It\u2019s been an eventful couple of weeks: 160\nfeatures, eight new series, six Screen Talks, immersive\nart and XR projects and much more. LFF kept busy\nfans, journalists, and critics not just from London. We\nare even a little guilty of prioritising it over lectures and\ndeadlines (otherwise how else would we create content\nfor our Film section?). Here are a few reviews from\nthe screenings we managed to get access to, and more\nabout the festival.\nThe Wonder\nDirector:\nStarring:\nRelease:\nSebasti\u00e1n Lelio\nUK/Ireland\nFlorence Pugh, Niamh Algar,\nCiar\u00e1n Hinds\nCountry:\n7th December 2022\nThe Wonder opens on a film set, and what at first\nseems confusing is welcoming after Niamh Algar\nintroduces us to the story as if she was telling it. \u201cWe\nare nothing without stories, so we invite you to believe\nin this one.\u201d The camera slowly pans towards Florence\nPugh, who plays an English nurse, Lib Wright, on her\nway to a small village in the Irish Midlands in 1862.\nShe\u2019s been offered a job to watch over a girl, played by\nK\u00edla Lord Cassidy, who\u2019d mysteriously gone without\nfood for months living off \u201cmanna from Heaven\u201d.\nBefore meeting the girl together with Lib, we are introduced to the village\u2019s committee, who are responsible for hiring her. It consists of five members, who are\nwell-known and respected: a priest, a doctor, a land-owner, a local publican, and a Baronet. \u201cIt\u2019s not your\njob to question us. You are here only to watch\u201d is what\nwe keep hearing from them. No matter how hard Lib\ntries to solve the mystery, prove something, they do not\nlisten. At some point she even goes along with all of it,\nuntilaLondonjournalist,playedbyTomBurke,arrives\nat the village and helps her figure it out.\nThe story based on the book of the same name by\nEmma Donoghue depicts the era of \u201cfasting girls\u201d. It\nthrows science against faith, the argument that was always relevant to society. Florence Pugh\u2019s character bases everything on facts, but still respects the beliefs of\nothers. The film might be a little slow-paced from the\nbeginning, but when all the cards of the mystery are on\nthe table, you just can\u2019t put your mind away.\nThe visuals seem routine, since there aren\u2019t many\nfilming locations. Throughout the story we barely visit\nover five locations. However, when it comes to the per-formance, every single actor delivers. K\u00edla Lord Cassidy is incredible at portraying this miracle girl. Florence\nPugh manages to channel her own strength and directness into her character, which fits so well within the\nstory.Castisoneofthemainreasonstowatchthisfilm.\nThe Wonder is not something easy to watch, it\u2019s a\nheavy story, a psychological thriller. It\u2019s about going\nagainst those extreme cases of religious abuse, about\nspeaking up even when no one wants to listen. The story is sensitively presented by Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio, which no\ndoubt attracts attention. There is something uniquely\ncaptivating within all this: story, acting, drama, and\nmystery. Everyone can find that miracle, that wonder\nthat will keep them watching till the end.\n\u2b51\u2b51\u2b51\u2b51\u2b52\nTHE CAST IS ONE\nOF THE MAIN\nREASONS TO\nWATCH THIS FILM\n\u201c\nCredit: BFI/Getty Images\nCredit: BFI/Getty Images\n\n"

Dispensers in student and staff bathrooms\nwill now no longer dispense sanitary products or\ncondoms but rather \u2018ket and baccy\u2019 and all mental\nhealth professionals at the College have been fired\nand replaced by patronising posters.\nMembers of the Imperial government-in-exile\nare torn over how to respond to the sudden coup.\nSome have argued for making peace with the new\noverlords of the College, pointing to benefits of the\ninvasion such as the rebalancing of the student gender ratio by the huge influx of Olivias and Ophelias\nthat followed the invasion. Some dissident elements in the exiled group have even suggested that\nthe only person capable of stopping the total takeover of the College might be Alice Gast. However,\nall appeals for her help have been met with silence\nor an out of office email reading \u201cChevron doesn\u2019t\npay me to care about your problems\u201d.\nIn other positive news, the Union has reported\nrecord profits from the bars which they say will be\nfunnelled into CSP activity budgets. The increase\nhas be driven largely by the massive upsurge in sales\nof cider and perry.\nThis is your yearly reminder that the Catnip section of Felix is satire.
