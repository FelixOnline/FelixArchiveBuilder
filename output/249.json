    "content": "FELIX\nHOW TO BE A GUILDS MAN\nGuilds' Freshers' meeting took\nplace in M xh. Eng. on the first\nThursday ot term and introduced\nthe fresher s to the Guilds Union\nand to its mascots. The lecture\ntheatre was, as usual, packed\nand rowdy.\nChris O 'Donnell. Guilds' President, introduced the \"Spanner\"\nto the fresher s and informed them\nof the \" sacred\" duties of all\nGuildsmen to protect it against\nall comers and to remove at any\nopportunity Mines' Davy Lamp\nand R.C.S.' s Theta. He ended by\nintroducing Guilds' inviolate\nmotor vehicle, Boanerges.\nThe Vice President of the\nUnion was then exhibited and\nsubsequently dismantled jn full\nview of the audience. His girl-friend, closely resembling Dick\nJames, spoke in his place and\ndescribed such important events\nas Morphy Day and the Guilds/\nMines Carnival.\nThe floor was finally given over\nto Paul Bradley, the Secretary,\nwho spoke about the Freshers'\nDinners, and to the representatives of the Entertainments Committee to describe their activities.\nFinally, the fresher s\\ were\ntaught the Guilds Chant and the\ndistinguished gathering broke up\nwith a rendering of the traditional\n\" Boomalaka.\"\nPeregrin at es in Southside\nIn a letter to the wardens of\nthe Southside halls, Mr. Singleton, the college's Chief Maintenance Officer, expresses a dim\nview of the fact that in the last\nmonth of last term the Southside\nlifts broke down a total of 18\ntimes, mainly due to overload-ing. He doesn't really mind\npaying \u00a34 a time for engineers\nfrom the Otis Co., but makes the\npoint that it does tend to add up.\nMr. Singleton is also concerned\nat the number of times that claustrophobic travellers have released\nthemselves through the engineers\nescape hatch. As the lifts run in\npairs in a combined shaft, the\ndanger of an upward climbing\nescapee meeting with a downward coming lift is too great for\nMr. Singleton's peace of mind.\nNot that he minds paying \u00a34 to\nget the Otis Co to scrape said student off the lift, but these things\nadd up. The escape hatches, he\nstresses, are for engineers only.\nResigning himself to the obstinacy of the student breed, he\nopines that a notice in each lift,\ncourteously pointing out that the\nhatches are meant for oily greasy\nmen to use, and not undergraduates, would probably serve to\ndouble the number of escapees.\nIn a similarly resigned vein, he\nhas explored the possibility of\nerecting a screen between the lift\nshafts to protect the miscreants\nhe is so powerless to stop, but\nconsiders it impractical.\nAnd so he plays his trump\ncard. Since most cases occurred\nat night (or, more correctly, after\nclosing time) he proposes the\nshutting down of all lifts after\n11 p.m. Sad news indeed for\nthose gregarious groups who prefer to do everything together.\nIMPOSSIBLE ?\n.... not if you buy your\ndrawing instruments\nfrom the\nBOOKS TALL Peasants revolt\nThis week a notice appeared in\nFalmouth Hall gallery; it reads,\n\" Give us air! Cool down jazzed-up heating. Citizens of Falmouth\n4th estate complain! \" By Oct.\n11th,33 of the hall's underprivileged classes had added their\nnames to the petition in an attempt to get the temperature of\nSouthside's central heating\nlowered, and downtrodden serfs\nfrom across the border in Tizard\nwere also said to be on the point\nof revolt. With luck their complaints will be quelled when the\nheating system breaks down in\nthe near future.\nLord Soper\nLord Super's lecture given to\nthe joint Christian Societies justifying his involvement in politics,\nwas remarkable for the way his\nidealism was tempered with\nrealism.\nIndeed, his main point was that\nthe church can no longer merely\npreach condemnation of evil, but\nmust translate the Christian faith\ninto action\u2014and this is bound to\nmean involving itself in the\nworld's affairs. He contrasted this\nview of the Church's role with\nthat of Billy Graham, who addresses his hopes only toward the\naft e life, and of Enoch Powell\nwho considers the realm of religion to be outside the public\nsphere, being a purely personal\nand charismatic experience. He\nmentioned his encounters in Hyde\nPark with some Flower Children,\nwith whose beliefs he had much\nsympathy, though he wished they\nwere more articulately stated. He\nhad been rather pleased to see\nthem burning incense, until he\nhad discovered that this was a funeral pyre for organised re li gion. He believed, of course, that\ntheir opting out of politics is as\nunrealistic as it is for the church.\nLord Soper went on to say that\nintellectually the church is \" in a mess\" and warned that no revival\nis likely, though in other ways,\nsuch as CND and Oxfam, the\nChristian spirit is very much\nalive. He criticised the pragmatic\nnature of contemporary politics,\nand asserted the need for some\nsort of idealistic staff on which to\nbase political decisions. This\nwould best be found in the Christian ethic to which he considered\ntwo principles fundamental.\nThese were common ownership\nand peacemaking, both of which\nideals are to be found in the sermon on the mount.\nTime was allowed for questions,\nwhich came at a lively pace. Lord\nSoper answered honestly and intelligently criticising both politics\nand the church where he considered necessary. His views are\nmainly left wing, and he rarely\nmentions God, as such, though he\ngave scientists the credit for demolishing previous naive ideas of\nGod.\nWells\nSoc\nhypnotised\nDr. Stephen Black opened the\nsession for Wells Soc. with an extremely interesting and entertaining lecture on hypnotism. He\nwas there to dispel any myth-or-magic ideas left by last year's rather unscientific talk. He constantly taunted the audience for\ntheir obvious and natural desire\nto see magic before their very\neyes, and emphasized the great\ndanger there is in the incompetent\nand misinformed use of hypnotism. Dr Black had brought along\nhis own deep trance subject. Mrs\\\nMarks, to whom the audience\nowes many thanks. Through iur.\nthey saw a convincing and\nfrightening demonstration of the\ntrue power of hypnotism. Dr.\nBlack had only to utter her \" code\nword,\" omicron, and she immediately went into a deep trance. To\nprove this, Dr. Black told her\nthat her left arm was numb and\nthen inserted a large needle, leaving it quivering there. The audience winced, but not Mrs.\nMarks. He introduced a post-hypnotic suggestion that at 10-15\nseconds after he brought her out\nof the trance she would get up\nand close the doors of the television monitor. This she did;\nthen, when asked why, tried to\nrational is e the situation with an\nunconvincing explanation. Dr.\nBlack asked for ideas from the\naudience as to what hallucination\nhe could induce in her mind.\nAmong the suggestions were a flying saucer, a pint of Guinness,\nHarold Wilson and an empty\nlecture theatre. He selected the\nlatter as the first might have been\nextremely frightening for her\nand the other two were rather unlikely and would have been\ndifficult for her to rational is e. He\nintroduced the idea that the lecture theatre was empty and then\nbrought her out of the trance:\nshe looked around her and then\nprepared to go home.\nThe lecture was by no means\n-only a stage show; Dr. Black,\nwho is director of a Nuffield unit\nfor research in experimental\npsycho-physiology, has been conducting experiments on the effects\nof hypnotism on brain rhythms\nand cortisone production.\nIn all cases the mental anguish\nproduced by hypnotism is shown\nto be real even if the physical\nsymptoms which normally produce it are absent.\nDr. Black offered to send Mrs.\nMarks back in time to childhood;\nhe chose the age of five. A member of the audience suggested advancing her age until death. Dr.\nBlack carefully and forcibly explained that this would be an\nirresponsible and highly dangerous thing to do, but one is still left\nwondering just what might have\nhappened.\nIf you can solve this problem in under 3 minutes\nVSO would like to hear from you\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 Insert the missing number *\n| \u00abA5\n& A| \u2022 8 1 1 1 0\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nVSO needs 1500 volunteers for\n1968/69...\n...YOU?\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS3 HANOVER STREET LONDON Wl\n\n"

And\nso the dream lingered on\nAnd then there arose in the land a mighty Ents Committee, 30\nin all, and great was the movement in that land. And the dream\nbecame flesh, and it was called the Plastic Fairytale, and it came to\ndwell in the midst of all, in the Upper Refectory put it down roots, this\nis the stor v and of the minds it will blow . . .\nThe Plastic Fairytale dream is\nMembership\nthem). Membership will cost 5s. to 10s. and a charge of Is. per\nsession is anticipated.\nof a Friday night discotheque\nwithin the Union, with light-sound show to rival UFO and\nMiddle Earth, brain cancellation\nperpetrated amid the purple haze\nof an inter-galactic environment.\nI digress\u2014the dream is almost\nmaterial, the baptism is set for\nOct. 27th if all goes well. From\nthen on every Friday (and possibly Monday also).\nThe lucky few who become\nmembers will at last be able to\nturn on within the hallowed walls\nof I.C Union. The planned name\nfor thi discotheque is the Plastic\nFairytale, although this could\nchange before opening day. The\nmusic will be loud, the light adjectivally indescribable, and the\ninvolvement total.\nImmediate plans involve wild\ndecoration with aluminium foil-covered walls,fluorescent drawings, ultra-violet illumination and\na white drop curtain covering the\nend wall, to be used as a screen\nfor various fiendish light ma-chin es. With the music piped\nfrom a discotheque at approximately 60 watts, instant disorientation is readily available to all.\nMembership will be severely\nlimited; all members will have to\nbe seconded by two other mem-be rs. \"This,\" said Ents Chairman Keith Guy \"will enable us to\nrestrict membership to the type\nof person who really appreciates\nthis kind of entertainment, not\nthose who come along just for a giggle.\" This definitely excludes\nthe hard drinking jumper-and-jeans crowd who will find that\nhard drinks have been thrown\nfirmly in the \" out\" tray.\nMany voices will, no doubt,\nbe raised in protest at the\napparent cliquish ness of the\nwhole affair, but Ents argue\nthat, as the discotheque does not\ninterfere with existing facilities, it\nshould be allowed to function for\nthe type of person for whom it\nwas created (as are the Links, 22\nand Chaps Clubs) without interference from those who could\nspoil it (Keith Guy warns of instant excommunication for members who cause trouble, and of a blacklist for those who seconded\nFuture plans for the Plastic\nFairytale are as inviting as they\nare unfeasible. Certainly it will\ntake a lot of effort to produce the\ngiant paper-and-fibreglass flowers\nwith which Keith Guy hopes to\nobliterate the unsightly ceiling,\nand to make the cosy alcoves he\nproposes for the corners of the\nroom, but the whole project will\nstand or fall on the amount of\nwork put in by those in charge.\nIt is hoped to provide a buffet in\naddition to soft drinks and lager,\nwith, possibly, music provided by\na resident group in the foreseeable future. Another pipe-dream\nis closed circuit TV to show the\nnarks outside just what they are\nmissing.\nWay Out Hops\nIf the plans for the Plastic Fairy\ntale are ambitious, no less so are\nth ps e for future Hop. After a profitable, if not memorable,\nFreshers' Hops, Ents have an ambitious programme for future\nevents. Entertainers, booked or\nvirtually booked for the near future include : Ben E. King, Crazy\nWorld of Arthur Brown, Marmalade, Zoot Money (with light\nshow as well as Big Roll Band),\nDantalion's Chariot and Picture\nof Dorian Gray , also approached\nare Amen Corner, The Peddlars\nand John's Children, although the\nlast named may be ruled out as\njust too way out.\nIt seems a pity that Ents should\nbe bound to farm out the Hops\nso that different societies can line\ntheir pockets from them. If the\nHops are to be worthwhile, surely\nthey must be considered as events\nin their own right, and not as\nmoney-making institutions for\nclubs and societies. This bleeding of resources must stop before\nreally good line-ups are possible\nfor the Hops.\nIncidentally, the word \" Hop \"\nis right out; all events in future, it\nis hoped, will have different\nnames from week to week. For\ninstance, the Harlington fireworks\ndisplay becomes, \" Explosion is\nNov 5th!!\" Traditionalists\nplease note.\nSpace\nEnts name their biggest problem as that of available space.\nFor years it has been obvious that\nthe Concert Hall is too small for\na big dance and Chairman Guy\ntalks with a faraway look in his\neyes of the day when the Union\nGym becomes redundant and it\nmay be possible to double the size\nof the Concert Hall, albeit at the\ncost of a couple of walls. More\npractical solutions are on the way,\nhowever, the first being a joint\nrave with Regent Street Polytechnic, using their excellent facilities,\nnext month. Tentative future\nplans include the use of the union\nquad in summer and hiring public\nhalls.\nAnd so the dream unfolds,\nJacques Robinson, Gordon Sage\nand Bill Bailey are in charge of\nmaking the Plastic Fairytale a success. They, and M. Smith are\nproducing some excellent graphic\nwork to advertise it, and a cast\ntoo great to mention are all busy\nputting the show on the road. It\nis now up to the 3500 other members of I.C. to see that they succeed.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nAfter the President of the Union, no one has more influence and\npower in I.C.'s student affairs than the three constituent College\nPresidents. While the campaign to produce the third gathers mo men tum, FELIX here turns the spotlight on the other two.\nAll about O' Donnell Chris O 'Donnell was elected as President of Guilds at the end\nof last year by a large majority over Frank Morris. A native of\nSheffield and life-long supporter of the Wednesday, his extra-cur ric u lar activities before coming to I.C. were mainly confined to playing\nsoccer for his school, a lot of tennis and being Chairman of the local\nyouth club \" running two-day twist sessions and that sort of thing.\"\nSomewhat incapacitated by a back injury incurred whilst taking a car to India, before coming to I.C., his Union activities\nwere few during his first year, but\nin his second year on the Ents\nCommittee of Guilds and as Publicity Officer for the Albert Hall\nFolk Concert, he showed a talent\nfor advertising and organisation.\nEvidence enough is that the Folk\nConcert made almost \u00a31,200 for\nCarnival. In addition he was\nBusiness Manager for \" Phoenix,\" played soccer for both I.C. and Guilds, and was a member of\nthe most imaginative Keogh Hall\nCommittee for many years.\nChris sees the constituent Colleges as providing something with\nwhich a student can immediately\nidentify. He sees their job as\nlooking after academic problems, citing the extremely good\nstaff-student relations built up\nover the years in Guilds, and of\nlooking after most of the leisure\nactivities of their members. He\nthinks the traditions of a large\nnumber of years help enormously in these respects, pointing out the new shields in Mech\nEng entrance hall, which have\nappeared after seven years. He\nalso thinks that the constituent\nColleges simplify the work of\nI.C.U., citing as an example that\nI.C. has the best calendar of social\nevents in London (Carnivals,\nBalls, etc.), most of which are\nrun by the constituent Colleges,\nand which would be difficult for\none Ents Committee to organise.\nHe would like to see the constituent College columns restored\nto FELIX. He sums up his views\nby saying \" The stronger the\nconstituent Colleges are the\nstronger is I.C. Union.\"\nOf the Guilds \"Paper dart\nimage,\" he points to the attendance at Guilds Union meetings\ncompared with those of I.C. Union. \" To get enough people\nthere you've got to attract them\nand to do that you must provide\nsome form of entertainment .\nthe best kind of entertainment is\naudience participation. Once you\nhave got the people there you can\ndo some business.\"\nA Degree ?\nAs a member of the I.C. executive the Presidents of each College have a very important say\nin the running of I.C.U. In this\nfield he finds Carnival one of his\nmain interests. He would prefer\nCarnival in the spring term, with\nmuch more imagination put into\nit. As for student houses he\nwould like to see them run under\nstudents' control \" at least as an\nexperiment.\"\nThe question of behaviour in\nthe bars concerns him and he\nsuggested the idea, shortly to be\nadopted, of having shutters, as in\nSouthside, in the Union Bar, so\nthat people can (hopefully) be\nleft in there to sober up a bit before disgorging into Beit Quad\nor the Lower Lounge.\nFinally, on the subject of combining the many duties of President of Guilds with being a3rd year undergraduate he said that\nhe hopes to get a degree. \" It's a matter of deciding what you\nwant to do and then doing it.\nMost students spend their time\ndrinking coffee or playing cards,\nyou've just got to give that up.\"\nCOLCUTT\nWho the hell is the average\nI.C. student anyway ? Nobody\nreally seems to know, especially\nthose on the executive council\nwho dispense the average stu-dents' money in the Union. After\nall, the average student contrib u but es around \u00a34 a year to the\nUnion in his fees; and as long\nas that comes in, who cares ? It\nseems to be unreasonable to take \\\nfigures from elsewhere and put\nthem in an I.C. context. A survey in Germany showed that 60\nper cent of woman students were\nvirgin. Don't kid me that's true\nat I.C. In fact, it's surprising\nthat so many women complete\ntheir courses at I.C. Perhaps it\nis because, as scientists, they're\nused to taking experimental pre-cautions.\nBut I digress. Does the average\nstudent do any more than spend\nan hour travelling each day:\nspend the morning getting bored\nin lectures enter the Union portals to wait twenty minutes for a lousy lunch : exit to attend a practical: climb back into a tube:\ncontemplate the legs placed so invitingly in the packed carriage :\ncook himself a tin of baked beans:\ndo some work : listen to \" I'm sorry I 'll read that again \": go to\nbed? Of course he may go to a party _on Saturday night. I say\nhe, because that's what the average student at I.C. is believed to\nbe. But nobody knows. They\njust know that there are around\n250 people who register as\nwomen students.\nIt is time that I.C. Union made\na determined effort to find out\nwho its members are. Because\nnobody knows, the Union's \u00a318,000 income a year is spent as\nthose active in the Union want it\nspent.\n\" It's elementary justice,\" they\nwill tell you; \" if you want something out, you've got to put something in.\" So you can justify\n\u00a31,500 spent in a year on the\nGliding Club. It's rather like giving the Aeronautical Engineering\nDepartment 10 per cent of the\nI.C.a cede mic budget to build its\nown Concorde. And likewise\nmuch effort is spent by those who\nare active in man oe uv ring: to\ndefeat the rugby club or to defeat\nthe politicians. And much effort\nis devoted to raising constituent\ncollege morale by methods more\nreminiscent of pre-wai Nuremberg rallies. All highly entertaining for those who take part. But\nthose who don't like being man-oe uv red aren't being brought in\nfrom the cold. And like Len\nDeighton's hero, they probably\nwon't make it over the wall.\nWELLS...\nIan Wells: a spirited Miner Born in Yorkshire in 1945 Ian Wells graduated after 11 hazardous years at primary school to Bridlington grammar . After this\nauspicious start he arrived at IC with an enormous fizz in1963 to read\nMetallurgy.\nHaving had 2J relatively quiet years at College he 'rose rapidly\nto prominence towards the end of his course and was only narrowly\ndefeated in the 1966 Presidential elections by Chris Molam. By last\nyear, however, he was so firmly established in Mines that he took the\nPresidency uncontested.\n\"Presidents should be\nmuch more\nthan just a figurehead.\"\nO 'DONNELL...\nThe question of behaviour\nin the bar\nconcerns him\nBy becoming president fan has\nfulfilled his ambition. But this\ndoes not mean that he is now\ngoing to relax. He believes that a President should be much more\nthan just a figurehead and he is\nproud of the relationship that\nexists between himself and the\nother members of Mines. This\nkind of relationship, he reasons,\ncan only exist in a union as small\nand as compact as Mines, at) i'< that it helps to create what he\nterms the \" spirit\" of Mines\nUnion.\nOn the administrative side of\nhis job Ian believes that a President should not necessarily form\nall the policies of his Union, but\nshould work with and represent\nfl.i she s of his committee as a*:\". jie He would like to see a;. rger emphasis put on the separate unions of Imperial college and\nis afraid that at the mw went too\nmuch life is formed around the\nindividual halls of residence.\nOn controversial subjects such\nas politics lan refuses to be\ndrawn, and says that a Union\nshould be in no way affiliated\nwith such things, except where\nthey have a direct bearing on students (as in the matter of government loans to students). On the\nquestion of parking Jan says that\nUnion members must be realistic\nand sec that they are not the only\nones in London being inconvenienced, although he hopes that a solution to the problem can be\nfound\nIan Wells is the type of person\nwho believes that you can only\nget out of life what you put into\nit. Will he spend all his available\ntime to make Mines an even better union than it is now? \" Quite\ndefinitely,\" he says.\nAny graduate who joins\nthe police should have his\nbrains tested.

FELIX\nEDITOR'Sv^ rom ment Examinations\nThe Editorial Comment of FELIX arises this week under some-wu at unusual circumstances; for the first time in some while there is\nno editor to write it and it should more properly be called the Assistant\nEditorial Comment. The reasons for this situation are not hard to\nfind and can in fact be summed up in one word : examinations.\nStudy ; and the Union\nImperial College has a world-wide reputation as a centre of\nscientific learning. The tuition and lectures it offers to its students,\nand the various courses they may choose to follow, are, in general\nexcellent; and the degree?, given to those who successfully complete\nthese courses are accepted everywhere as being of a very high standard.\nThe corollary to this is that to obtain these degrees requires a great\ndeal of hard work. The other side to I.C. is our large Student Union,\nwhich\u2014despite the lavish criticism heaped upon it in the past\u2014is\nboth active and worthwhile. Unfortunately, to keep it so, and to\nimprove it, also requires a lot of time and effort from those involved.\nConsequently, the demands of academic study and Union work often\ncollide, and most often to the detriment of academic study The\nresults are obvious in, among other things, the number of FELIX\nstaff who failed to return this year.\nGrim reputations\nFELIX is not the only Union organisation to have suffered in this\nway. Dramsoc and Ents Committee have equally grim reputations.\nA place on council is vacant, together with the Chairmanship of\nDebates, the Wooden Horse Club lacks a President, added to which\nthis year's R.C.S. President has yet to be elected. There must be a large nu- -ber of other people, who, while not actually failing, must\nat least have had their chances of a good degree appreciably reduced\ndue to Union work. All of which poses the question is the Union\nso important? I am not decrying the Union by any means; I.C. has\na very fine Union and should be proud of it. What I am decrying is\nthe common attitude that whatever happens every part of the Union\nmust function and that some bod v must do the job.\nApathy and degrees\nA large proportion of the Union is often criticised by the remainder \" for being apathetic \" and for taking no part in Union affairs,\nbut those \" apathetic students \" who devote some free time to study\ngain more direct benefit than the student who helps to run the Union\n\u2014a better degree. This is important, I feel, despite what anyone may\nsay about \" social experience.\"\nThe problem of conflicting interests is likely to increase rather\nthan decrease, as the Union grows and the academic courses become\nfuller and more demanding. There is no simple answer to it. Any\nManagement Studies tutor worth his salary will tell you that the\nanswer is organization, and past editors of FELIX have somewhat\nhopefully suggested \" a correct balance between Union and studies.\"\nFor those unaccustomed to organization and \" balance \" this is small\nconsolation. Unless I.C. is to have another large crop of failures in\nthe next exams, perhaps the only answer is simply a less vigorous\nUnion.\nUtopian Answer ?\nOr perhaps this is not the only answer. Perhaps what Presidents\ndown the ages have been saying about involvement in the Union has\na point. At present, the Union is run by a small minority of active\npeople, while the remainder feed upon their df forts. Societies are full\nof casual members who contribute little, hops are full of students who\nmerely pay and do not help on the Ents Committee\u2014in short, there\nare not enough people \" lending a hand.\" If the work load of the\nUnion was spread over a much larger number, each running a smaller\nportion, then perhaps I.C. could, successfully, combine \" business\nand pleasure,\" academic study with Union activities. It sounds a Utopian dream, but it seems that if steps towards Utopia are not soon\ntaken, then I.C. may well find the \" pleasure,\" of business and\npleasure,\" gradually disappearing.\nF nX Imperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel.

I would like to\nclear up some of the \" facts' he\nquotes.\n190 people were accepted into\nthe first year Physics course this\nsession. In accepting these students the staff dealing with admissions assume that all entrants will reach the third year.\nIn their second year these students will have lectures in a theatre sitting 250 people, Lecture Theatre 1. Practical classes\nwill be held in the laboratory, as\nin previous years, but the introduction of a course of computing\nin the practical syllabus will ensure enough places in the Laboratory Third year work consists\nof a general lecture course, held\nin Lecture Theatre 1, and special\ncourses in the small 120 seat lecture theatre. There are 8 special\ncourses, 41 of which are held in\nother departments , this means\nthat there is ample room for all\nstudents. Thus, far from condemning 20 students a year, the\nPhysics department finds places\nleft vacant by students changing\ncourses, and contrary to the impression given by Colcutt, takes a great deal of interest in its\nstudents.\nThis is illustrated by the following facts. 169 students sat the\nfirst exam last year ; there are\n155 students in this year's second\nyear. Ten students failed to return because of their examination\nresults, but of these 4 have found\nplaces in Physics departments at\nother universities, 1 has a place\nin the Mech. Eng. department, 1\nis now in Metallurgy, and 4 have\ndecided that they wish to return\nto the I.C. Physics department to\nres it their exams next year. Two\nmore have transferred, one was\ntaken ill, and one is re sitting this\nyear This is quite an impressive\n\" rubbish heap.\"\nI would also like to complain\nabout the irresponsible character\nof Colcutt's article. The Royal\nCollege of Science Union spends\nmuch of its time and energy in\nestablishing and maintaining\ngood relations between staff and\nstudent. When such comments\nare made in a supposedly responsible column can the staff be\nblamed for showing reluctance to\nstrengthen these ties ?\nYours sincerely,\nMIKE TAIT,\nActing R.C.S. President.\nFELIX thanks Mike Tait for\npointing out that some of Colcutt's column was, in fact, er-ro neo us.I would like to assure\nthe staff of Physics that he was\nnot alone in this ; many Physics\nstudents have commented on the\ninaccuracy of the phrase: \" condemning 20 students.\" Nevertheless Colcutt has perhaps aired the\nfeelings of many in speaking of a generally high failure rate at I.C. If he has drawn attention to this\ncommon viewpoint, it is all to the\ngood.\nCarnival needs you \u2014\nand MONEY !\nThe Carnival is a delicate beast\nwith one claw in the Union and\none in the public, and balancing\nboth the College and the police\non its back (we were only threatened with legal action twice last\nyear).\nHowever, like all the other\nactivities of the Union it is run by\na relatively small group of\npeople, who are themselves uneasily balanced between academic\nand social life. This year's Carnival is particularly short of experienced organisers who can\nonly come from the ranks of the\nP.G. s, who have more maturity\nand less pressure from exams\nthan the ordinary undergraduate.\nThere are also gaps for fresher s to build up experience and influence for future years.\nWhat is Carnival to the ordinary person ? It is an opportunity\nfor students to indulge in the licence that the public ung rud g ingly allows them, under the\nguise of supporting a charity\nWhat is Carnival to the student\nof I.C.? It is a couple of mad\nnights collecting in the West End\npubs and outside the cinemas , a concert in the Albert Hall a sweaty hop with Jimi Hendrix\na fe te in Prince's Gardens just before exams. The trouble with\nCarnival is that it is tending to\nbecome a super-Entertainments\nCommittee without Union parti-ci pati on. Super Ents.\nIt must be understood that\nCarnival is as much a part of the\nUnion as is Mooney and that\neveryone can make an effort towards it.. It is the job of the\nCarnival Committee to make\nmoney regardless of the means,\neven if it does mean acting as a super-Ents. Committee. No one\nwill deny that this is not the\nimage Carnival desires. Everyone must ensure, therefore, that\nthose events that require mass\nparticipation get it.\nPublic money\nnot for free\nPerhaps the greatest result\nof last year's Carnival was the\nrealisation, at last, that students never have any money\nand that the public is rolling in\nit\u2014wallowing in it. The students\nat I.C. must be at the extracting\nend and not the paying end of\nthe transaction. For instance at\nthe Jimi Hendrix dance last year\nnearly every groupie in London\nwanted to pay his, her, or its ten\nbob to get in. This also illustrates that the public pay if they\nfeel they get something in return,\nbut rarely give something for\nnothing (have you ever had a groupie put a coin in your collecting tin ?)\nThe actual charity has yet to\nbe chosen but planning of the\nCarnival is due to start. For this\nwe need help\u2014actual material\nhelp, some of your free time,\nsome of your ingenuity, some of\nyour ideas, something from you\nto show that I.C. Union embraces\nevery part of everyone in Imperial College.\nCorbyn's Newthink\nIn the last issue of FELIX we saw what Wells wrote about I.C. on\nleaving it in 1934.\nI.C., as Wells said, still has very little idea of what it is supposed\nto do in the long term but it has a recognised \" goal \" of producing\nmaximum scientific and technological \"progress.\" The question is :\nWhat is the \" progress \" for? Since Hiroshima probably more, but\nnot enough, scientists and technologists care about how progress\naffects people in the immediate future. However, all too often our\nvision is too limited; we seem frightened to ask \"Where are we going?\"\nSociety is now changing (due to technological progress) much faster\nthan in Wells' day, therefore society needs even more of those people\nwhom Wells could not find. We need more individuals who think and\nsearch freely, who are more involved in wider spheres of human\nactivity than is studied at I.C., who are capable of providing some\nsocial and political leadership. We need people who have some\nphilosophical and social ideas and who want individuals and powerful\norganisations like I.C. to have a long-term goal.\nThis month a new national student magazine called NEW\nTHINK (termly Is. 6d.) is being\npublished. Its main aim is to allow people to become more involved in discussion on important\nmatters around them and to encourage individuals to gain the\nqualities which we must all have\nto build a better society You\nare invited to read \" Newthink.\"\nApait from promoting free\ndiscussion in a magazine, more\ncould be done on a local level to\ninstil more vision and purpose\ninto individuals and the college\nas a whole. I.C. Union and the\nconstituent College Unions can\nobviously play a part here as representatives of students. The constituent colleges must be concerned with this apart from their\nown inward-looking domestic\naffairs because they are in closer\ncontact with their members and\nunderstand them better than I.C Union could ever hope to, be\ncause members of different con\nst it u ent colleges often have ver)\ndifferent problems and outlook or\nlife.\nAnnually, R.C.S. churns out\nhuge numbers of groping, immature scientists. I want to ask th< two candidates, Bob Mackman\nand Frank Fuchs, what they intend to do, if elected, to encourage in individuals and \" the\nspirit of R.C.S.\"( what is it?) a greater involvement and understanding of things greater than\nI.C. and a greater vision and pur-pose.\nPR.

It is\nto avoid incurring a similar\nloss this year that the prices for\nMooney's meals have been raised\n(3d. for main courses and 2d. for\nsweets in the lower refectory and\n6d. for sweets in the upper re-fec tories). This represents a rise\nof 8-9 per cent, but the prices for\nexternal meals, that is, meals during the vac. will be raised by 10-i5 per cent.\nThe increases should bring an\nextra \u00a313,000 which will cover\nlast year's loss plus an anticipated\ndeficit of \u00a35,000 this year, thus\ngiving an overall profit of about\n\u00a31,500. It is hoped that this profit\nwill enable prices to be kept\nstable over the next few years, so\nthere is no immediate intention of\nraising prices still further.\nMr. Mooney, the Refectories\nManager, stated that as last year's deficit was mainly a result of having to keep prices down because\nof the freeze, the College authorities may be able to refund all or\npart of it. He also said that there\nwas no question, as has been suggested, of Bar profits sub sidi sing the Refectories loss, as last year's Bar profits were only \u00a372.\nACADEMIC STRAIN\nTOO MUCH ?\nBLOW YOUR MIND/\nPlastic Fairytale,\npage 6\nFuchs contests RCS once more One post on the LC executive, that of the R. CJS. President,\nis as yet unfilled. George Hulme, who would have taken up the pos i this year, failed his finals and resigned at the beginning of this term.\nTwo candidates for the post have now definitely emerged from the\nnomination sheet: Bob Mackman and Frank Fuchs.\nMackman is at present R.C.S. Secretary; Fuchs was George\nHulmes defeated opponent in last- year's election campaign. Both\ncontenders have strong claims to the post, and both have firm areas\nof support inside R.C.S.: both have long records of involvement\nwith R.C.S. and with I.C. Union.\nA third year Physics under-graduate, Bob Mackman's main\nachievements to date have been\nin changing courses of lectures\nand lessons all th rou eh his academic career. At secondary\nmodern school he persuaded the\nstaff to introduce O level chemistry into the curriculum. Next, in\nthe sixth form at grammar school\nhe managed to change the science\ntimetable to accommodate the\ncourse of A levels he was taking.\nDormant in his first year at I.C., he became departmental rep. for\nPhysics in his second year, and\nproceeded to campaign for the\nintroduction of a Management\nStudies course. This idea was the\nfruit of the Physics staff-student\ncommittee which he instigated last\nyear after a questionnaire that he\ncirculated to discover the opinions\nof Physics students on the course\nthey were taking. He was awarded\nR.C.S. social colours last year,\nmainly for setting-up the staff-student committee.\nIn the same field, the R.C.S. constitution has now been\nchanged, at his instigation, to accommodate an Academic Officer\nto continue work on improving\nR.C.S. courses. It appears that\nhe would be a generally popular\nand approachable President.\nA nuclear physics P.G., Frank\nFuchs, has in the past aroused\nextremes of emotion in people,\nboth those prepared to slander\nhim ad lib, and those who consider he would make \" one of the\nbest Presidents RC.S. has ever\nhad.\" He has had a somewhat\nturbulent career in seven years in\nstudent affairs, having threatened\nto sue Colcutt, having been,\namong other things, chairman of\nthe I.C. Communist Society,\neditor of \" Sennet,\" and U.L. U. Social Vice-President, and having\nresigned each of these posts prematurely after \" differences of\npolicy.\" He has a reputation as\nan \" ideas man.\"\nin union affairs; there is a good\ndeal of similarity in what each\nsays. But Mackman's overriding\ninterest would be on the academic\nside, in following up the introduction of the Management\nStudies course, which he regards\nas only the first step. And Fuchs\nplans to improve R.C.S. as a community and as a distinct college union, by introducing an\nR.C.S. newsletter and an \"R.C.S. open day,\" whose purpose would\nbe, among other things, to attract\nmore girls to the College (a worthy example of long-term\nplanning).\nMackman\nfavourite\nWhether R.C.S. will get all it\nis promised is possibly another\nstory, but surely it can at least improve on last year's record, when\nonly 30 per cent of the College\nturned up to the ballot box. A survey of 100 students in the\nChemistry Department last week\nshowed that 65 of them intended\nto vote\u201428 for Mackman, 9 for\nFuchs, and 23 as yet undecided.\nThe other 35 per cent claimed to\nbe totally disinterested, but it\nlooks as if the issue is still very\nopen. In the name of democracy:\nVOTE!\nThe election is by general ballot\non Monday 23rd, and the result\nwill be announced at an R.C.S. Union meet in a on the 24th. Policies:\nInvolvement &\nAcademics\nGeorge Hulme was elected last\nyear without, apparently, the help\nof any election promises; but this\nyear the situation is different, in\nthat both candidates have produced a set of policies they intend\nto follow if elected. Both would\nlike to increase R.C.S. links with\nthe Royal College of Art, to press\nfor larger postgraduate grants, to\npress for better student parking\nfacilities,, to involve people more\nChris Palmer\nelected to\nCarnival\nAt last Friday's meeting of the\nCarnival Board Chris Palmer was\nfinally elected this year's Carnival\nCo-or d in at or. The appointment\nwas made as an unanimous decision after the other candidates\nfor the post had stood down. The\nactual charity has yet to be\nchosen, but Chris, a second-year\nMinesman, commented that he\nfavoured a large well-known one,\ncapable of appealing directly to\nthe general public, rather an internal I.C. cause. He added that\nit was unfortunate that Rollo\nGreen had failed. Rollo Green\nwas, in fact, due to be this year's Co-or d in at or. Bob Mackman\nFreshers Hop Improved\nThe first Saturday of term once again brought the Freshers' Hop,\nwith 1984, Marshall Scott, etc., and the Kynde playing to over a thousand students in a packed and perspiring Union Building.\nThis year, as opposed to last, everything went smoothly. All\nthree groups turned Up and played with enthusiasm to an audience so\nresponsive that, at times, to weave one's way through the gyrating and\ngenuflecting masses was a feat almost on a par with clearing a path to\nthe crowded bar. Reactions were mixed, but on the whole appreciative, varying from the odd group of slightly bewildered fresher s silently\nnodding appreciation under the multi coloured lights to the undistinguished ex-member of the Union who stood amid the twisting bodies\nand blew a. gentle, but distinct, raspberry.\nKeith Guy, the Chairman of\nEnts, to whom credit must be\ngiven for the organisation, which\nwas a dramatic improvement on\nMutiny in\nthe Bar\nOn Sunday, 8th October, the\nfirst weekend of term, the Union\nbar was closed all the evening.\nThe only bar open in the Union\nwas in the Lower lounge, and\nhere the new high prices for\ndrinks (2/2 for bitter) were being\ncharged.\nThe official reason for this was\nthat there was insufficient change\nfor two tills (one in each bar) to\nbe in use, and since there had\nbeen a special request for the\nlower lounge bar to be open for\nthe Sunday night Folk and Jazz\nsession, the staff decided to open\nthis bar. Consequently the main\nbar doors were locked, thus preventing anyone from playing darts\nor shove Ha'penny, and forcing\neveryone to pay 2d. per pint\nextra.\nMartin Lack did try to get the\nUnion bar opened and the low\nprices charged in the Lower\nLounge. However, Howard, the\nchief barman, forcibly refused to\ncomply, although Lack theoretically had the authority to order\nthese changes. Martin com-men ted,\" Howard is a very difficult person to get on with,\" and\nhe added, \" this was one of the\nnastiest experiences I have ever\nhad.\"\nWhen asked about the incident,\nMr. Mooney, who is ultimately\nresponsible for the bars, replied\nthat it was an unfortunate occurrence and that positive steps were\nbeing taken to ensure that the\n.situation. did not recur.\nlast year's, was extremely pleased\nwith the hop and claimed a profit\nof about \u00a3200. Some confusion\nwas caused at the beginning, due\nto Martin Lack omitting to publicise the fact that the Union would\nbe closed while the hop was on,\nbut this was soon cleared up\nbefore the majority of people ar-rive d. Re Colcutt\nFollowing Collcutt's unfortunately misleading information in\nthe last issue of Felix about the\npruning of numbers in the Physics\ndepartment due solely to the lack\nof space, Professor Wright and\nother members of the teaching\nstaff have been privately reassuring the students concerned that\nthis is not the case. The number\nof students admitted each year is\ndecided by the Educational\nGrants Committee. IC accepts\napproximately this number and\nthe department then sets about\naccommodating them.\nThere is no question of the 3rd year being cut down until they\ncan be fitted in the smaller lecture \"theatres, holding 120. This\nsession, for the first time, all three\nundergraduate years are having\ntheir lectures in the main lecture\ntheatre (seating 250), the only\ndifficulty being slight timetable\nalterations.\nProfessor Wright also rejected\nwholeheartedly the idea that students who do leave are \" thrown\non the rubbish heap.\" Dr. Pain\npersonally follows up the fate of\nall of them, and most go to other\ncolleges throughout the country.\nLes Prior peregrin at es round Southside!\nSee page 2\n\n"

The XV seems to have a big and mobile pack this year,\nand the three-quarters are potentially a very good combination.\nTo morrow? The club gained 70 new members this year, not as many as last\nyear, but Club Captain Bob Pine\nhopes for eight full teams. The\n1st XV has matches lined up\nagainst the 2nd XVs of clubs like\nRichmond, Wasps, Rosslyn Park\nand Harlequins, and the 1st XV's of a number of other colleges and\nuniversities, while the fixture lists of the lower teams are also very\nfull. A brief note for members :\nall players are asked to tick off\ntheir names on the team lists as\nsoon as possible each Monday.\nCome on IC If you are genuinely un athletic( and are still reading this column)\nmay I suggest hat you can have a thoroughly refreshing afternoon\n(in the fresh smog of outer London) as a spectator at Harlington,\nwhere there exists the friendly atmosphere of club sport and an\nexcellent bar Not only will you\nenjoy yourself but you will provide for the college sides that encouragement which is often lack-ing. (To get there you may travel\nby hired coach from the union\nfor only 4s. return).\nFor Purists For the occasional spectator\nthere are various sporting events-in which IC can hold its own (and\neven excel on occasions), and\nthese are well worth watching.\nAmongst these are the Gutteridge\ncup, which is the UL U Rugby\nknockout cup which we seem\nhabitually to lose in the final, the\nHyde Park Road Relay, which\nstarted life as the IC individual\nroad race, and which has been\nrepeatedly expanded until now it\nincludes international competition\nand teams from most British\nUniversities. The Boat club competes in the summer in a series of\nregattas, the best known of which\nis Henley where they have done\nwell for the last two years. Apart\nfrom these there are many more\nlight-hearted occasions of the\n\" sport \" variety in which \" audience participation \" is welcomed.\nThe events, which usually originate as an inter-collegiate competition, include Morphy day\n(venue \u2022 the embankment at Putney), the pancake race (Beit quad\non Shrove Tuesday), the swimming sports (any bath that will\nhave us) and mixed rug ger. These\nare all dress events for which you\nshould carefully consider the\nThe Gutteridge Cup: \" Which we seem habitually to lose in the final.\" Not this year, we hope!\nI One in seven |\nOne in seven of those graduating in 1968 will go\ninto industry.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nColl cut t Tower The figure of\ngiven to FELIX\nIt's IXl's answer to the Leaning Tower of Pisa ; its the masterpiece of the most revered correspondent on FELIX; it has been\nvigorously acclaimed and savagely condemned for its architectural\n\u2022merits and demerits; and the sum of \u00a3203,000 is to be spent over the\nnext year in propping it up. What is this building ? It can only be\nthat monument of great notoriety, CoDcurt's Tower.\n\u00a3203,000 was\n_ by Mr. Fairclough of the Planning Board responsible for the new College\nBlock area. Of this, \u00a3175,000\ngoes on the tower alone\u2014in repairing it\u2014and the remainder\non providing a concrete podium\nfor it to stand on, and a lawn\naround this. Propping up the\ntower has been made necessary\nby the demolition of all the\nbuildings adjoining it\u2014the old\nImperial Institute\u2014and is on a fairly large scale. The original\nbase of the tower was a solid\nconcrete bed some 25 feet thick\nand the base walls were 9 feet\nthick. Both walls and base are\nbeing strengthened\u2014the walls by\nan internal concrete sheath, the\nbase by a number of piles driven\nabout it. with an enormous ring\nbeam which is being incorporated\nwith these.\nMagnificent Monument?\nBut Thomas Collcutt's brainchild was not always so secure. In\n1956 those planning for the new\nCollege Block very nearly passed\na plan to demolish it\u2014which\nmany might call a public service.\nThe plan was eventually altered\nto incorporate it as a free-stand-ing campanile. This was largely\nthe work of noted poet John Betjeman, who so stirred the House\nof Lords and the residents of\nKensington that the tower was\nkept, while the buildings all about\nit were destroyed. These buildings were originally the Imperial\nInstitute, a Commonwealth mu-s eum, whose foundation stone\nwas laid by Queen Victoria; the\nInstitute was paid for by public\nsubscription and the whole thing\nwas of sentimental value, if nothing else.\nSuitably enhanced by oratory,\nthis sentiment was one of the key\narguments in the lengthy House\nof Lords debate on the subject.\nThe remainder makes interesting\nreading : \" . . . this great work of\nCollcutt . . .\", \". . the jewel-like quality of the detail of Collcutt's building . . \" The opposing argument was, in effect, the\nmore new buildings there were\nfor I.C. students the better, and\nthe more demolition, the more\nnew buildings for I.C. students.\nBut this did not win the day. In\nfairness it should be added that to\ndemolish the tower would cost\nat least \u00a325,000, it being of sound\nconstruction; so sentiment was\nnot the only consideration. That\ndebate was 11 years ago ; jewel-like quality or not, the tower will\nbe with I.C. for many more years\nto come.\nFriday night jazz\noff to good start Alexis Korner\nThe first event in the I.C. Jazz\ncalendar was Friday nig'it's concert held in co-operation with the\nFolk Club, in which Alexis\nKorner and the Tubby Hayes\nquartet played to a packed\nhouse in the Union Concert Hall.\nThe concert was opened by\nAlexis Korner. He played mainly\nconventional blues including free\nadaptations of songs by Joe\nTurner, Robert Johnson, Duffy\nPower, Muddy Waters and King\nOliver. He also played some\noriginal pieces including an impersonation of a Boogie piano\nplayer. He accompanied himself\nmainly on the electric guitar\nwhich demonstrated his great\ntalent to the best advantage in the\nconcert hall. His own comment\nthat his \" intention was often\ngreater than the ability \" was far\nfrom true and he treated the audience to a highly entertaining\nand accomplished performance.\nHe was followed by the Tubby\nHayes Quartet. Tubby gave a sparkling performance on tenor\nand also on flute. He was very\nably supported by bass player\nRon Matheson, Tubby's great\ndiscovery from the Shetland Isles,\nwho seemed to make the double\nbass talk during his solo; the\n^s nec i all v brilliant playing of\ndrummer Tony Levin together\nwith the superb harmonic ingenuity of pianist Mike Pine combined to produce the sound acknowledged as absolutely top rate\nboth here and in America.\nAfter the interval Alexis again\nplayed with the brilliance he had\nshown in the first half and was\nwell received by the audience\nwho recalled him for an encore.\nTubby Hayes rounded off the\nconcert with a less lively but none\nthe less enjoyable performance.\nThe concert was a great success\nand it is hoped that future Jazz\nand Folk club sessions follow this\npattern.\nFor fresher folk fans who prefer a more informal atmosphere\nfor their \" folk,\" club sessions\nare usually held in the Upper\nrefectory every other Wednesday\nHere well-known artists play\nalongside College performers.\nFriday night jazz sessions will become a regular feature, with big\nname bands this term. The next\nconcert is on Friday October 20,\nwith the Alan Elsdon Band, experts of traditional jazz on the\nBritish scene. Amateur College\nperformers who wish to show off\ntheir talents can perform at the\ninformal Sunday evening sessions\nof Jazz and Folk in the Union\nLounge.\nICWords\nKnobbly Knees\nThis year I.C. admitted 70\nwomen fresher s. This means a record number of women undergraduates\u2014159 in all. The numbers of postgraduates arc as yet\nunknown but the total number\nof women should topple the 200\nmark. However, with recent\ntrends away from science in the\nsixth forms it is unlikely that the\nnumbers of women will increase\nto any great extent.\nOwing to circumstances beyond\nhis control, Andy Powell, last\nyear's Mr. ICWA, has failed to\nreturn to College and this means\na re-election. Nomination papers\nwill be posted on the ICWA\nnotice board, so if you know\nsomeone in the College with the\nknob b lies t knees who would make\na good Mr. *ICWA\u2014nominate\nhim soon! Elections will take\nplace at the next general meeting\nof ICWA. Although there is to\nbe no ICWA party at which these\nelections can take place, I am told\nthat the knobbly knees contest\nwill still be held. Likely candidates are as yet unknown, but rumour has it that Pete Franklin, of\nThird year Chemistry, will be\nstanding again.\nMixed Rugby\nDo you fell like wallowing in\ntwo feet of mud, wearing a rug ger shirt 10 sizes too big and defending a goal against 15 \" husky \"\nmen? Then volunteer for the\nICWA rugby team\u2014Guilds have\nchallenged ICWA to a match\neven though the odds seem a little\nunfair; there are hoped to be 30\nIcwarians in the team. No doubt\nthere will be ample compensation\nfor the mud and bruises afterwards at the Harlington Bar!\nFELIX CROSSWORD\nContributed by\nS.D. Walter\nACROSS\n1. Sore part of the train? (6)\n4.
