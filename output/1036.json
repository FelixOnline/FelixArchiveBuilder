    "content": "TWENTY-TWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 1 3TH1995 LETTERS\nLETTERS TO FELIX: REPLIED TO THIS WEEK BY JEREMY Irrational FELIX or Barmy Bayley?\nDear Editor,\nWe are writing to express\nfear over the apparent direction\nthat journalism at Felix seems to\nbe taking. We refer to your\nresponse to a letter in Felix 1035.\nWhilst we do not subscribe to the\nviews of ConSoc, Ian Bayley\nappears to be terrifyingly correct\nin saying \"Felix is no place for\nrationally discussing issues of the\nday - Hence the need for our\nsociety.\" The concern is that\nImperial could be losing its only\nsource of impartial information\ninto the abyss of sensationalist,\npolitically biased journalism.\nYour reply of \"What gave you the\nidea that Felix is politically neu-tr al\" implies that it no longer is.\nIs this your view alone or the\nview of Felix generally? Felix is\nthe most widely read and the\nonly serious, impartial source of\nnews in College. This impartiality\nnow appear under threat. As\nthere is no alternative to Felix it\nshould be impartial. To reject\nFelix is to starve oneself of college news.\nUndoubtedly, views should\nbe expressed, but its place should\nbe in editorial and opinion\ncolumns. Our chief worry is news\nreporting will be affected by\nwhat appears to be Felix's new\npolicy.\nPlease do not turn the news\npages of Felix into an arena for\npolitical mud sling mg. Yours sincerely,\nSam Asfaw, Chem II\nJames Fox, CivEng II\nAlan Mole, Aero II\nFaisal Nazir, Physics II\nPlease be. assured that our\nnews pages will remain as high\nquality as we can manage, and\nfree from spin. This is how it\nworks - we are funded by the\nUnion, but we arc free to say\nwhat we want, hence the 'Keep\nFelix Free' business. Our primary objective is to consider the\nmajority of the students - but\nnot necessarily by agreeing with\nthem. But I am worried that\nyour idea of impartiality seems\nto suggest we shrink from\naddressing highly important\nissues, even if people write to us\nabout them. The editor's replies\nto letters are an opinion section.\nOh, and there's always the IC Reporter.\nDear Rachel\nHaving read last week's Felix\n(from cover to cover obviously!) I came across the somewhat petulant letter by the ever reactionary\nIan Bayley. His lecture of misinformed nonsense could not, I felt, be allowed to stand without\na full questioning of the author's own version of logic.\nThe initial reaction on reading his letter is that a small article\nin the 'news in brief column\ncould not quite be described as a 'voracious campaign' or 'hysteria'\nas Mr Bayley so delicately puts it.\nSome might suggest that it could\nbe the ConSoc chair who is trying\nto hype the issue in an attempt to\ngain publicity with a new band of\nfresher s but then I couldn't possibly suggest that he would be so\nmercenary.\nAs far as I can remember\nfrom the original small article,\nyour newspaper was not even\nsuggesting that Mr Murdoch\nshould be defended, merely\npointing out that ICU could be\nlaying themselves open to legal\naction by allowing such articles to\nappear in their web pages.\nWhatever Mr Bayley may say, the\nWeb pages still come under the\nUnion's control and as far as I am\naware , he has not yet been\ndeclared an expert on the legal i ties of the Web page liability.\nI do hope that although you\nstate that, while taking a line on\ncertain issues, i.e. not being completely politically 'neutral', your\nwill remain\na place for\nrationally and impartially discussing the 'issues of the day'.\nThe thought that ConSoc, with\nall its inherent prejudices and\nparty dogma, could be a refuge\nfor such discussion is frightening.\nIt is with some trepidation\nthat I find myself agreeing with\nMr Bayley on the fact that Mr\nMurdoch does wield enormous\nunchallenged power. I would\nquestion the background to his\nfear - perhaps the fact that Mr\nMurdoch's titles seem to be easing themselves towards supporting the Labour Party might have\nmore to do with his views, than\nany antipathy to the idea of the\nabuse of power without the necessary scrutiny.\nFinally, could I point out\nthat rather than hindering\nConSoc, your reporter's article\nand the fact that you were prepared to print their reply, have\ndone little damage to the society\n- as few other groups have been\nthe topic of conversation within\none week of the start of term.\nName retained.\nExactly.\nFood Fight?\nDear Sir/Madam\nThe rank and file staff in the\nCatering department are outraged at the insulting comments\nmade by John Foster, Catering\nManager.\nWho exactly are the staff\nwho \"currently enjoy high wages\nand long holidays\"? It is a fact\nthat those employed in the catering industry are poorly paid.\nIf the sickness rate among\nstaff is high, surely he needs to\naddress this issue, and perhaps\nimprove working conditions.\nThere is no doubt that such crass\ncomments do little to improve\nmorale.\nTake heed, Mr Foster. A bad\nworkman always blames his tools.\nYours faithfully,\nThe overpaid &i constantly\nholidaying catering staff.\nI 've been on caterers' wages\nmyself: they were the lowest.\nThere must be something\nawry with the management if\nthey can make such hopeless\nlosses even with underpaid staff\nand a captive market.\nTo all IC International\nStudents\nNow that you've all more or\nless settled down, it's time to get\nyou informed about what the\nOSC is and what it does to keep\nyou happy. OSC or \"Overseas\nStudents Committee\" deals with\nall the international students of\nImperial College (EC and\nOccasional students included).\nThe OSC is a Major\nSubcommittee of Imperial\nCollege Union and deals with the\n37% of the student population\nthat is of non-British origin.\nImperial College is one of the\nmost multicultural academic\ninstitutions in the world . OSC is\nthe umbrella committee for the\nforeign student societies, which\ncurrently number 24. The OSC\norganises events such as food\nfairs, International week, discos\nand inter-society sporting events.\nIt also organises international\nnight. This is the largest event of\nImperial College that occurs in\nthe second term and attracts\nmore than a thousand spectators\nevery year. It includes cultural\nshows and displays of various\ncountries, food fairs, disco, live\nbands and more fun than you\ncould possibly imagine.\n\n"

The front of\nthe restaurant consists of five large glass panels,\neach with a letter of 'coast' inscribed upon it.\nOnce you've found the entrance (the pane on\nthe left] you enter a large room covered with\ntables. Another room lies below, but it is smaller and darker - while I was there a couple decided not to dine here, rather than having to eat\ndownstairs. My tip is to dress elegantly and book\nearly if you want a table.\nOnce you're seated, you can pursue the\nmenu. Good luck! The cook is English but well\ntravelled, the waiter informed us. The dishes are\nsupposedly Californian, but seem rather inter-national. All the dishes are over complicated\n(and too expensive], as you might expect for this\nmonth's fashionable restaurant.\nWe ordered (I recommend the Chablis\nBrocard, no. 23 (top choice - Edj) and received\nour first courses within minutes. Francois (one\nof my companions] had chosen duck raviolis,\nwhich he found exquisite, though I thought it a tad rich. Martine (my other companion] had\ndeclined the first couse, while I went for a 'Bavarois of Goat's Cheese with Salad'. It was\nfairly large and rich. I would have preferred the\ncheese warm and a smaller portion. Overall the\ndish was well balanced and nice.\nWaiting for the main course, we amused ourselves by working out where the waiters would\nsit people. It seemed that people in jackets were\ngiven the nice room, whereas those in trainers\nand jeans or young people were placed below.\nThe main course arrived in good time.\nFrancois had chosen 'Baked Cod with Polenta\nPont-Neuf' which turned out to be cod and\npole nt a chips. A definite success. Martine\nenjoyed her 'Lamb with Harissa sauce and\nCouscous'. I had 'Soup Noodles with Duck',\nwhich was disappointing. The duck was perfect,\nbut the soup and noodles were bland.\nUnfortunately, the only dessert I was willing\nto try, 'PJiubard with Custard' had been\nreplaced with 'Creme Bruiee', so we quickly\npaid the bill and left.\nIn all, rather disappointing for an in rest au rant, especially as there are no lunch menus.

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 1 3TH1995 NEWS\nHizb-ut-Tahrir\nStrike Again\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nAn extremist Islamic group\nwho were caught illegally\nexhibiting at Freshers' Fair last\nweek appears to have struck\nagain.\nIt is believed that Hizb-ut Tah rir, a group entirely separate\nfrom IC's own Islamic Society,\nhave been attempting to\ndistribute unsolicited leaflets\nthrough departmental pigeon\nholes as well as putting leaflets\nunder students' doors in Prince's Gardens. Reports have reached\nFelix of literature being placed in\nthe departments of Physics and\nAeronautics, issued by what calls\nitself the \"Hizb-ut-Tahrir\nCultural Commitee\", although it\nis unclear whether or not IC\nstudents are responsible.\nOne or th do x Muslim\nstudent who did not wish to be\nidentified, seemed to have taken\nthe law into his own hands and\ndisposed of some of the\nliterature himself having seen it\nin his department. He said that\nthe majority of Muslims distance\nthemselves from Hizb-ut-Tahrir\n\"and it's quite common to see\npeople go up to them... and ask\nwhat they're doing and why.\"\nHowever, he seemed\nsurprised at the apparent\ntameness of the literature itself;\n\"They've never been that quiet\nbefore... they've been quite open\nabout what they do.\" Set up in\nthe 1950s the group, which\nclaims to have been continually\nmisrepresented, has been widely\naccused of being anti-semitic,\nsexist and homophobic.\nThe student went on to\nthe or is e that some young male\nMuslims were drawn to the\ngroup not so much due to its\nideology as its notoriety.\nOther students reported the\nunsolicited delivery of leaflets at\nFalmouth-Keogh Hall, though\nnone of the staff nor security\npersonnel appeared to be aware\nof their distribution. The\nWarden of the Hall, Professor\nGeoffrey New, said, \"It's very\ndifficult to control. If it's a student I'm not really sure what\nwe could do to stop it.\"\nThough it has come to light\nthat more otho do x Muslims have\nhad leaflet campaigns in the\nPrince's Gardens area, Hizb-ut Tah rir have been similarly\ndistributing material. Felix did\nattempt to contact Hizb-ut Tah rir on the contact telephone\nnumber that had been given on\nthe leaflet. The number itself\nturned out to be a switchboard\nextension of a company which\nhad said it didn't have knowledge\nof any religious groups.\nHizb-ut-Tahrir were\nparticularly active last academic\nyear when their behaviour was\ncondemned by London Colleges\nincluding KCL, SOAS, and the\nUniversity of London Union\nitself, which consequently\nbanned them from its premises.\nOn Wednesday Brunei\nUniversity shut down its own\nunion's Islamic Society as it had\nbeen so overrun with Hizb-ut Tah rir members.\nSitting down: Eric Allsop takes the chair Photo:William Lorcnz\nThe vacant position of\nImperial College Union Council\nChair was filled by a Mechanical\nEngineering Postgraduate, Eric\nAllsop, in a two man contest on\nTuesday night. The post had\nbecome vacant because the\nintended incumbent, Vinod\nFernandez, is no longer at\nImperial. The first meeting of\nthe year had to fill a number of\nvacant posts, including that of\nWomen's Officer.\nAfter considerable difficulties were experienced in the\nelection of the four Ordinary\nMembers, the bulk of the\nmeeting was taken up with talk\nof the proposed Union move to\nSherfield. The mood of Council\nwas clearly hostile to any\nrelocation away from Beit Quad,\nwith many questioning the\npracticality of cohabitation with\nthe administration.\nFollowing protracted, and\noften heated discussion, Council\nunanimously agreed to back\nICU's approach of arguing for\nthe best facilities in a possible\nShcrfield-based Union, while\ncampaigning for the extension\nof the existing base in Beit\nQuad.\ncontinued from page 1\nrag gie said that 'He didn't seem\nany worse than many other\npeople get throughout the year.'\nA spokesman for Rag said\nthat Mr Willis had been very\ncareful about obtaining\npermission for the event,\nespecially with regard to the\nfunds for the drinks. He had\nraised the matter at a Union\nFinance Committee, and\nreceived assurances there, and\nlater from Matt Crompton, Dep.\nPres. Finance and Services, that\nthe idea was acceptable\n'assuming that he was aware of\nthe licensing rules'. When Mr\nWillis inquired at the bar in order\nto get the spirits, he was told to\nget them from an off-license.\nResponsibility for the\nincident is confused, with a letter\nfrom Security seemingly\nabsolving Richard Willis from\nblame, saying that 'every effort\nwas made to ensure that new\nstudents were not encouraged to\nover-indulge,' and that his actions\nfollowing the event were 'highly\ncommendable'. However, Matt\nCrompton stated in a memorandum that he held it to\nbe, 'the responsibility of the\nsociety concerned to control the\nquantity and ensure that people\ndo not have too much to drink...I think that it is the- responsibility\nof Rag to ensure that they didn't drink to excess.'\n\n"

    "content": "simon baker\nAs a passive 10- a day\nman, I shall be forced\nto start buying my\nown if people ever\ntake any notice.\nWell, another year at Imperial has just begun,\nand the new inmates have arrived- three years\nwith early release for bad exam results. I shan't waste much time regaling fresher s with lots of\n'useful tips' that you have probably already\nheard. However, dear reader, one piece of advice\ndeserves to be repeated. Many of you new, anti-establishment, free spirits may be used to referring to the local constabulary as pigs, the filth etc.\nThat's fine by me, you naughty children, but do\nremember that those fine, upstanding gentlemen in red police cars are\nall known as, 'Sir'. I shall\nsay no more.\nA surprisingly large\namount of news seems to\nbe floating around\nCollege even at this early\npoint in the term.\nReports of excessive\ndrinking have not\nescaped me, and I am somewhat concerned.\nTrue, Imperial does have a number of serious\ndrink problems. Firstiy, it takes an eternity to get\nserved in Southside bar (although it's always\nworth the wait), and secondly, the beer in the\nUnion is reminiscent of the yellow liquid often\nfound in the South Ken. subway. More serious-ly, as long as bar staff exercise their right to refuse\nservice to people who are clearly on the verge of\nunconsciousness, we will not have a problem.\nDrinking is not the only activity which is\nbeing watched. The JCR now has a blanket 'No\nSmoking' ban, and in the process has exhausted\nworld supplies of signs to indicate this. As a passive 10- a day man, I shall be forced to start buying my own if people ever take any notice.\nAlso, religious fundamentalism again seems\nto have reared its ugly head in the guise of Hizbut-Tahrir. Whilst no reasonable person would\nquestion the right to free speech, such extreme\nviews have no place in a democracy, a system\nalien to many of the organisation's members.\nIn the world beyond SW7, much media\ninterest has concentrated on the shenanigans of\nour gallic cousins in the Muroroa Atoll. Although\nthe whole need for these test looks a little questionable (and I'm as pro-nuclear as the next\nman), given the software now produced by the\nAmericas to model such events, I fully understand Jacques Chirac's wish to conduct the tests\nin an ostensibly deserted area, where there is little chance of affecting humans. In which case,\nwhy not explode the devices in Disney Land,\nParis? That way, the coral\nreefs of the South Pacific are\nnot threatened, and if radiation levels were to become\ndangerous, the existence of\nmutant animals would go\nunnoticed in a place solely\ninhabited by six foot high\nmice and ducks. As far as the\nboycott of French products is\nconcerned, I can honestly say that I haven't bought a single bottle of vintage champagne\nsince the whole sorry saga began.\nCloser to home, the party conference season will have finished by the time you read this.\nSocialists can again walk freely in Brighton, and\nthe Liberal Democrats will return to maintaining\ntheir pivotal position in the political wilderness.\nAs for the Conservatives, this year's conference\nwill effectively be the first part of their election\ncampaign. It would be wrong to suggest that\ntheir chances of forming the next government\nare similar to Lord Sutch's as a result of the Blair\neffect.\nAny party can be hugely popular if it attacks\neverybody else without burdening itself with\nsuch sordid things as policies and commitments.\nTime will tell if the British electorate can be persuaded by arguments so thin as to be non-ex is tent.\n\"a son of the\ncircus\nslips back and forth in\ntime, mixing its characters' backgrounds and\nthen bringing them into\ncomes complete with\n[twig's wry; absurd\ns ease oi humour.\"\nbook: a son of the circus-john irving tintin Perhaps the best measure of John Irving's skill as\na writer is that he manages to involve so many\ncomplex characters in the 830 pages of his latest\nnovel, A Son of the Circus, without losing either\nthe plot or the reader.\nLoosely based around the 'who is it?' of an\nIndian serial killer, Irving's hero (a Canadian\nort hope adic surgeon come Bollywood script-writer; bom in Bombay but belonging nowhere\nand incidentally called Farrokh Daruwala) lands\nin India for his usual five yearly visit. So what to\ndo? Farrokh used to bleed dwarfs from the circus to try and find the genetic cause of their condition (but that's become a bit of a fading hobby\nnow), so he waits to see how violent the reaction\nto his new Inspector Dhar film is,forgets to tell\nhis 'adopted' son that he has an identical twin\nand further forgets to tell his 'adopted' son that\nhis twin is a Jesuit missionary who will land in\nBombay at some point in the next two days. He\nalso goes to his club only to find that there's been\na murder on the ninth green.\nIn-between we go back in time, to the start\nof Indian's most bm tal and bizarre serial mur-der s, which coincidentally also led to the marriage of a Bombay police inspector, the start of\nDr. Daruwala's writing career and his conversion\nto a particularly low form of Anglicanism.\nMaybe you're getting the picture. A Son of\nthe Circus slips back and forth in time, mixing its\ncharacters' backgrounds and then bringing them\ninto locus again. And it all comes complete with\nIrving's wry, absurd sense of humour.\nDespite, and because of, its length too (by\nthe end you're wishing for just one more chap-ter) A Son of the Circus is a real joy to read.\n\n"

One man's story of the Spanish Civil War\ncomes complete with politics and a bit of\nromance thrown in for good measure too. And\nit's not a bad film either. The only problem is the\none that is director Ken Loach's trademark. He's a political film-maker and despite the fact that\nthis film is ostensibly about the stifling of the\ntrade union and anarchistic militias by the com-munis ts, he has to get contemporary as well.\nThe film starts with ambulance men running up a tower block staircase in Liverpool. The\ncamera ignores them, focussing instead on the\ngraffiti behind. The NF and BNP slogans are\nstark; warning us that Loach is trying to make a statement. And he certainly does. It's just a shame that in order to do so the film has been to\ngiven such a clumsy plot structure. To bring the\nstory 'up to date' Loach tells it as the granddaughter reads the letters that were sent back\nhome.\nBut back to the story. David (Ian Hart)\nleaves England an unemployed communist\nready to fight fascism. In Spain he joins up with\na trade union militia, fights in couple of skirmishes and tries to lie back and forget Blighty.\nAnd throughout it's the small-scale ness of the\naction which is impressive. The sixteen strong\nmilitia use ancient rifles, only throw the odd\ngrenade and survive on a diet\nof bread and beans. Land and\nFreedom is no Braveheart.\nYet their idyll is slowly\nbroken by the growing power\nof international Stalinism. It\ngets the militia new rifles but\nwith them also come uni-forms, discipline and orders.\nThe dream is over and in the\nclimatic 'final battle scene' the\nmilitia are forced to surrender\nat gun point by their own side.\nBack in the Nineties,\nDavid is buried and his granddaughter gives the workers'\nsalute like it means something\nnow. So does Land and\nFreedom end, as a good film\nspoilt by good intentions.\n\u2022 film: species*\nIt takes about ten seconds of the opening credits\nto realise that Species is going to be a distinctly\nsecond rate Alien(s) rip-of fi The first clue is the way the title letters\ncome together in backlit luminous green and the\nsecond is the way the name of \"Giger - design-er\" leaps out of the screen. Not that many of the\naudience will care in the least. The only thing\nthat the audience care about is the way a very\nthree dimensional Natasha Henstriage will leap\nout of the screen. She, of course, is a mega babe and the only reason for the film's existence.\nThe plot is sketchy in the\nextreme - all you'll want to know is\nthat Henstridge is an super\nmeta boli sed alien who has a burning\ndesire to reproduce (much to the\ndelight of the male population of LA\nJf- ' and the audience]. Unfortunately for\nthe 'hit' team sent to hunt her down,\nher offspring will develop so quickly it\nwill be sexually mature in a matter of\ndays. An obvious problem if it turns\nout to be male. Still, thankfully lor the\nF audience, our alien is a gorgeous,\npouting, 'bon king and killing machine'\nwho takes her clothes off and kills\npeople with monotonous regularity.\nAnd with equal monotony the\n'hit' team follow a couple of steps behind, talking in hushed and stereotypical cliques.\nSo all in all Species is an appalling film without any redeeming features. I'm sure that it will\ndo very well.\n\n"

Yes, I know I was meant to go to it\nwhen I started University, but\nsomehow it never really quite\nhappened. And by the time I had\nbeen here a year I didn't have a particularly large desire to\nexplore Imperial's Students\nUnion in all its glory. So it's been\na learning experience for me too,\nlistening to all the first years' discuss the new experience with\nenthusiasm, while those later on\ndegrade it all with cynicism.\nSitting over a coffee in the\nJCR, and one of them sums it all\nup: \"The union's crap\". And noone has any doubt what he's trying to say. It's not \"I tried to get\nsome legal advice and found the\nsupport un forthcoming.\" Nor is\nit \"I tried to hire out a minibus\nand couldn't.\" Imperial College Union is\njudged on Wednesday and Friday\nnights. And if you don't have a riotous evening, then clearly\n\"The union is shite.\"\nAt first I thought it was the\npeople. Maybe no-one's getting\nthe stimulating conversation\nthey crave. And let's face it,\nthere are individuals at this college of ours that make Beavis and\nButthead look like epigrammatic\nsophisticates. There are people\nwho would make you want to\nsprint out and buy a gallon of\nemulsion merely so you could\nslap it on a wall and watch it dry\nrather than engage in a millisecond's conversation. But that's not the real problem. Oh no.\nTo appreciate Imperial\nCollege Union at it's finest you\nhave to be sitting in an office\nround the back of the entertain-ment's lounge editing news stories on a Wednesday night. And\nwhile the heavily laden bass\nmakes the teaspoons rattle on\nthe sink you have to ask yourself\nWHY they are playing the remix\nof the Bee Gee's 'Staying Alive'\nAGAIN. There must be a reason.\nSurely. Why, every time, is it the\ntackiest of dance music, with\n'Parklife' as the penultimate\nsong?\nI have yet to meet anyone\nwho does anything other than\npour scorn on the music they\nplay here, and that includes the\nents manager.\nThis does not seem to make\na great deal of sense.\nEDITORIAL TEAM:\nNEWS: ALEX FEAKES AND JEREMY CLARKE\nMUSIC: VIK BANSAL\nPHOTOGRAPHY: IVAN CHAN AND DIANA HARRISON\nSCIENCE: BEN WILKINS\nj ii: JEREMY\nEVERYTHING ELSE: MARK BAKER\nCOLLATING LAST WEEK:\nMARK BAKER, TIM STCLAIR, JEREMY\nDELIVERING:\nCHRIS INCE\n\n"

FIVE\nFresh faced\nOn Monday night fire alarms were set\noff by the ents lounge smoke machine\nand the union was evacuated an hour\nbefore closing.\nOn Wednesday everyone had to sit on\nthe floor when too many turned up to\nsee the comedy. Later a window was\nsmashed in the ents lounge.\nOkay, I admit it. I wasn't there for college acid jazz type outfit Bandicoot. You can\nblame another gig on the other side of London\nfor that.\nWhat I can say is that when I saw\nBandicoot in the union a few months ago I was startled by their musical cohesion and\nexpert playing. By all accounts, tonight they\nway surpassed that performance, not least\ndue to the introduction of some fine female\nvocals.

First up are Earthquake who\ndidn't so much as violently shake the\ndancefloor as gently rock it with their\nsoothing dub sounds. Fine as a get-the-drunk-people-in-the-mood type of thing.\nAnd in the mood they most certainly\nwere for final live act of the night,\nAstralasia. Astralasia had done their\nhomework.

    "content": ">in\nScience that is out. of the or di nary, eyebrow raising and slightly over the edge: this week\ninsight exposes some disturbing truths about one of science's most coveted theories-Quantum Physics. Could it possibly be true that\nthere is not a single lecturer on campus who\nunderstands it ? Insight investigates.\nAnd, thanks to some unusual investigative\njournalism, we are close to solving a mystery\nwhich has puzzled scientists and philosophers\nalike throughout this century: Where do all the\nodd socks go?\nThe Mysterious World of\nthe Quantum\nQuantum physics, arguably the most successful theory ever, is also the most bizzar e. For\nexample, according to some quantum theories:\n\u2022 All particles (electrons, atoms, tennis balls)\nbehave like waves and vice versa.\n\u2022 Every time someone makes a decision anywhere in the universe, the whole universe\nsplits into two.\n\" something strange is a foot.99 The Experts Own UpThey Don't Understand\nIt Either\nIf you find all this quantum business baffling,\nyou are in good company. The nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman once wrote:-\".../ think I can safely say that nobody\nunderstands quantum mechanics.\"\nAnd he ought to know! Another founder of\nmodem physics, Murrey Gell-Mann says:-\"All of modern physics is governed by that\nmagnificent and thoroughly confusing discipline called quantum mechanics invented\nmore than fifty years ago. It has survived all\nthe tests. We suppose it is exactly correct.\nNobody understands it but we all know how\nto use it and how to apply it to problems: and\nso we have all learned to live with the fact\nnobody can understand it.\"\nIt seems this pragmatic approach is universal.\nSo it really is true - nobody at Imperial College\nThe Quantum Rollercoaster\n\u2022 Quantum objects can momentarily break the\nlaw of conservation of energy.\nThe startling consequence of this is that quantum objects can quickly sneak across a region\nwhich is illegal energetically...\nConservation of energy says that a carriage\nstarting from rest at A could never get further\nthan point B. In quantum theory, on the other\nhand, there is a chance that the carriage could\n\"tunnel\" through the \"forbidden\" region\nbetween B and C and emerge at C. For a real rollercoaster, this quantum tunnelling is extremely unlikely! However, for\nquantum particles such as electrons it is very\ncommon. Many devices in common use, such as\nthe scanning tunnelling microscope and the tunnel diode are based on this phenomenon.\nor anywhere else for that matter really understands quantum physics.\nStrange Things are Afoot\n- Quantum Sock Theory.\nBy the time you have been at Imperial for a couple of terms it is (un)likely you will have had\nto do some laundry. If so, you may have witnessed a strange phenomenon - the random disappearance of socks from washing machines.\nInsight has come to the amazing conclusion\nthat what we are witnessing here is a quantum\neffect occurring on a large scale in the everyday\nworld.\nQuantum sock theory was first proposed earlier this year by Matthew Flynn (Physics World\nMay 1995 p72) and is rapidly gaining credence\nand acceptance amongst the scientific community. Could it be that socks are quantum objects\nand are quantum mechanically tunnelling from\none washing machine to another somewhere\nelse in the universe?\nFlynn is convinced this is the case and\nalthough quantum sock theory may be hard to\naccept, the evidence he puts forward is com-pell in g:f ft j f] Socks disappear from inside washing\nj| machines. This statement is so bla-( pIt ant ly true it hardly needs proving.\nHowever, if you doubt it just check\nyour collection of socks. It is almost certain that\nsome socks do not form pairs, showing conclusively that some are missing.\nSocks can also appear inside washing\nmachines. This is not so clear to the\ncasual observer, but yet again a quick\ncheck of your sock collection should\nsoon convince you. You are bound to find at least\none odd sock that is not yours. You did not buy\nit and you were never given it. The sock just\nappeared one day.\nClearly the spontaneous creation and\ndestruction of socks inside a washing\nmachine would violate all conservation laws, especially sock parity, and\nthe conversion of the mass of the sock into energy would certainly play havoc with a low temperature wash.\nSo if socks cannot be spontaneously created\nor destroyed, the only explanation is that socks\ntunnel between machines. Already this term,\nthere have been several reports from IC students of likely tunnelling events. After losing a woollen sock during a wash at a local launder et te, Valentina Cvord (Mech Eng) said \"I noticed it straight away, I definitely had the pair\nbefore they went into the machine.\" And only\nlast week mining student Sophie Dowson lost\ntwo socks (not a pair) in one wash! \"I couldn't believe it, they had just vanished - I am devas-tate d.\" she said.\nSince the probability of tunnelling depends\non the width of the barrier, It is likely that most\nsock tunnelling will occur between machines\nwhich are in close proximity. Readers are urged,\ntherefore, to try their own quantum sock experiments and report back on their results.\nAnd anyone who finds my green Paddington\nBear sock turning up in their machine should\ncontact insight urgently.\nBen Wilkins\nXII "

    "content": "gig:levellers + prophets of\nda city - b rbr toru singles:,!\nI suppose you could say that Prophets of Da\nCity are important. Important because they look\nlike being the first ghetto-grown South African\nact to make an impact outside their troubled but\never progressing homeland. And yet, live at least,\ntheir music comes across as startlingly un imp or tant. The traditional African influences are lost\namidst the standard hip-hop beats and over the\ntop rapping, while two mid-stage break dancers serve to accentuate the frailties of the live performance rather than adding an interesting visual\ndimension. Still, it's pretty impressive that they\nmanage to get half of the white, middle class\nteenage crowd shouting, \"Ho!\", even if the reality of it is total absurdity. And as for the retarded\nspeech about the Criminal Justice Bill and how\n\"every government in the world is trying to f*** with people\"- well, I guess that explains what\nthey were doing supporting The Levellers.\nAh yes, The Levellers. Let it be said that I have never liked those veteran crust ies. Okay, I 'll be the first to admit that they put\non a good show. They perform new ies from\n'Zeitgeist', oldies from A Weapon called the\nword', and middle-aged ones from 'Levellin' the\nLand' and 'The Levellers' with zest and an inspiring passion. No, to me their problem lies in their\nstubborn adherence to their pseudo-revolution-ary ideals. Their new Ts lii rts talk about anarchy\nand how \"anyone who lays their hand upon me\nto govern me is a monster, a tyrant, and I declare\nthem my enemy\", or something. Their songs talk\nabout non-conformity to the police, to society, to\nanyone but yourself. And yet this show embodies\nall the best points of a stadium rock show. There\nare thousands of people singing and moving to the\nsame songs, expertly co-ordinated lights that\ncomplement the music, and changes in stage\nbackdrop. Fine, but don't pretend that this is anything different. The Levellers are making pots of\ncash singing,\"There's only one way of life, and\nthat's your own, that's your own.\" Tell that to the\n4000 'individuals' who were all singing it in unison and choke on the irony.\nIl fc\"3.:///\"'3/33.B::[^'\\ BB'$3y fi\\... y'3 W k/33?3$K Iiki a was written in between\ntwo nf their Al nel JJSMVS.

The first year\nbiochemist had been attending\nthe Rag Freshers' event in the\nUnion Ents Lounge at lunchtime,\nwhere free shots of spirits where\nbeing offered as incentives to get\ninvolved.\nThe fresher was found by\nthe newly appointed Project\nManager of Estates, Ian Frame, in\na 'barely conscious state' outside\nthe Bookshop. Mr Frame,\nconcerned for the young man's health, alerted security, and the\nfresher was subsequently\nescorted to the Health Centre in\nPrinces Gardens. After\nexamination, the Health Centre\nwere satisfied that he was in no\ndanger and contacted Mr Willis\nwith regards to the incident.\nThe Rector has been made\naware of the incident, and has\nalso received a copy of the\nsecurity report.

One person said that the\nfresher had been acquiring drinks\nthroughout the meeting, and that\nMr Willis, seeing the fresher was\nthe worse for drink at the end of\nthe meeting, advised him not to\nhave another.

Both have a touch of ref rdi h' their sty ff p but the real difference is that whereas the La's, despite their great moments, produced an awful\nlot ol tat, the same cannot be said ot their prodi-gies. From listening to the album, a live set and\nseeing them perl on nI can honestly say I haven't heard a bad Cast song.\nCast have given themselves and their album\ngreat publicity by releasing two of the best songs\nthis year in 'Fine Time' followed by Alright'. Both\nare un critic is ably beautiful songs every bit as good\nas the revered 'There She Goes'. These two\n..releases have alone highlighted Cast's originality\n.is song smiths at a time when most of the music\n' j timi j the North West of England is a dour bland coco phony of Oasis-esque Mancunian\ndm el (whether from Manchester or not]. It\nseemed improbable that lor the other ten tracks\nit could live up to their singles but happily I was\nwrong. The album is fairly diverse in style but\nevery song is highly listenable, and none are album\nfillers slung, on to make up n inning time. Among\nthe tracks are \"Walkaway', a beautiful ballad dis-g sensitivity and brilliant vocal tone in the\nScotigg: accent. In 'Sandstorm' guitar, voice and\nbass intermingle flawlessly, and in 'Promised\nLjnli|s| 'iJ||an kind', and 'History' they have a triple td fr5o tent i. il hits to follow Alright'. So long\nas their material doesn't dry up, we can expect\ngreat things from them.\nIn summary - you'd be a fool not to buy this\nalbum. (9)\nalbum: garbage garbage^ Ho, ho, ho. What a wonderfully ironic band\nname. How I'd love to be able to tell you that the\nwhole tiring has backfired and they are, in actual\nfact, a load of garbage. Unfortunately, you can't always manage to get things your own way,\nalthough Butch Vig (he who produced Nirvana's' Nevermind', Smashing Pumpkins'\n'Siamese Dream'\nand Soul Asylum's 'Let your dim light\nshine', and is now\ndrummer and creative force behind\nthis lot) is doing a pretty good job of U doing just that.\nOpener 'Super-vixen' sets the pace\nwith layered guitars,\nall manner of loops\nand rhythmic sound\neffects and the alluring vocals of ex-Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie and\nAngelfish lassie, Shirley Manson. If you're looking\nfor a reference point then try Curve with no pretence and plenty of tunes. But that does not do\njustice to Garbage. This album is flawed but different, conventional yet ready to take a chance,\nfrom the blatantly melodic but darkly, menacing\ntones of 'Only happy when it rains', through the\nplain scary industrial guitar pop of Vow', to the\nclosing number,\n'Milk', which manages to achieve the\nsexy, claustrophobic\nsound that\nPortishead probably\nnever will.\nAs debut albums go,\nimpressive. As\nalbums from failed\nmusicians-turned\nproducers-turned\nmusicians again go,\neven more imp res sive. (7)\nalbum: straw donkey carter us rn b vms. c. dick\nJim Bob:- \"O.K.

So do Abba\ntribute bands and Gary Glitter.\nYes of course this is a good album, ultimately\nbecause of the earlier pearls of wisdom\n'BloodsportforAll', 'Sheriff Fatman' and the like.\nAs for the new single 'Bom on the 5th of\nNovember' poignant lyrics, great! 'Sheriff' at half\nspeed. Hmmm.\nAnd yes of course we need bands as eloquent as\nCarter, Billy Brag, Elvis Costello, Crass, 25th of\nMay etc. but don't expect them to change the\nworld for you.

    "content": "ur first\nport of call\nwas Caracas\nVenezuela\nby virtue of the cheap flight that we bought to\nSouth America.\nThis is a developed country waiting to happen.\nIt has all the resources: from its huge oil\nreserves along the tropical Orinoco delta to its\nrich supply of mineral deposits present in the\ntemperate cord of the Andes that marks the\nend of that mountain chain in the west of the\ncountry. Several factors have conspired to halt\nits development and in\ntypical South\nSimon Bolivar who liberated the country from\nthe Spanish in 1819. As a result, today in the\nVenezuelan reckoning of the order of things\nthere comes Almighty God then Simon Bolivar\nEl Iibertador, and then everybody else. Every\nsettlement from the smallest hamlet to the\nlargest cities centre around a Plaza Bolivar. It\nwas from Ciudad Bolivar that we visited Angel\nFalls, the highest free falling water fall in the\nworld at 979m(16 times the height of\nNiagara). It is simply amazing. By the time the\nwater reaches the bottom it is a fine spray, broken up by its own fall, and in the jungle\nhundreds of metres away you are showered.\nWe toured the country further with the time\nwe had left\nand it was\nAmerican fashion, these\ninclude corruption,\neconomic mismanagement (like setting\nthe petrol price at 5pence per gallon)\nand no doubt a generous helping of\nmeddling from their neighbours on the\nNorth American continent.\nVenezuela also has large stretches of\nco as dine on the Caribbean Sea that few\npeople, save the Venezuelans, know\nabout - indeed they market themselves to\nforeigners as the Canbbean's best kept secret \"\\\n- well now you know. Anyway, we weren't long in heading for these beaches and we soon\nrealised that the tourist board marketing boys\nweren't far off... actually I think Cadbury's may\nhave filmed the odd Bounty advert here, and\nby the looks of it they had left some of the\nleading female parts behind!\nAfter a week of these beaches I was a rich\nshade of crimson and I decided that I should\npull myself (and my melanomas) away from it\nall in order to investigate the interior of the\ncountry. We started with a journey down to the\nOrinoco and its one bridge in the entire country\nat Ciudad Bolivar. This city is named after\nnot so\nmuch the country\nthat stood out so much as its\npeople, their customs and\nquirks. I thought I had never met such a friendly nation of people\n(though other South\nAmerican countries would prove\nsimilar). For example, you don't ask them\nanything without first saying 'hello' and 'good\nday' (a habit that earned me strange looks in\nshops back home) and sometimes your original\nquestion is forgotten amidst the ensuing\nconversation. They also make you smile; like if\nthey don't allow you on a bus if you are wearing\nshorts or how they don't sell stamps in a post\noffice, stupid! or how they would rather answer\nyou half asked question with a 'Yes' than listen\nto the rest of it.\nhen*? it \u00bb ; VlpfBOiiiii::':! v fe\":0: rr\n-\n"

TWENTY-ONE\nfist, and although we spent a week moving\nand splitting boulders and chipping away at\nbedrock with hammers and chisels, the\nentrances kept chocking with rubble. To our\ndisappointment all our digging efforts came to\nnothing.\nIn the meantime though there had been\nsome success. Four caves on the edge of the\nmountain had started to show real promise,\nincluding one called 'Julians Panties'. A chilling breeze draught ing from its\nentrance lead us to believe that the void\nbeyond had huge volume, anc\nodds were 10 to 1 that is w over 1000m deep!\nAnother cave aptly\nknown as 'Torn T had been exp lor and surveyed to a depth of 80r during Slovenia '\n'94 and was\nthought too\ntight to continue\ndeeper. Two pus\nrevealed ap vertical shaft and\nim pass i bly tight pitch\nfrom which a thrown rock would\nbounce around for seconds below\nTime was passing, and after three\nweeks of work on the mountain, whole meal chap patti s, bean curry and loose stools, our\ncaving clothing was in tatters. Unlike\nYorkshire caves which are smooth from water\nand decades of human impact, Slovenian\ncaves are generally tight and sharp. Although\nour minds were strong and our enthusiasm\nwas high, our bodies were weak. A weekly\ntre ck was made down the mountain for a much needed wash and a group headed off for\na weekend in Trieste, Italy, to the nearest\ncaving supplier and to find a whole load of\nbabes on the beach.\nBack at camp, we got down to pushing\nthe leads. 'Torn T' is a difficult cave to push.\nIt starts with a tight entrance rift, then a long\ntight rift with difficult navigation, involving\ntricky free climbs. Tackle bags of rope and\ntools often needed to be passed forward, and\nequipment frequently got caught on cave\nwalls. It takes about three hours to get this\nfar, and with many hours of chiselling and\nbolting, one of the thinner among us was able\nplop through the 'Otimisqueeze' and\nexplore further.\nOn the way out we s wang over\nonto a ledge, and were delighted\nwith the find. It was a horizontal dry gallery\ncovered with black\nboulders under\nwhich there was\nsand. In\nplaces there\nwas fresh\nrunning water\nd scores of ways\nto explore - great avens\nin the ceiling and pitches in\ne floor. It was the ideal\nplace for an underground camp.\nAfter a trip to Postonia, we set up\ne camp where three of us explored\nthe gallery area to emerge late next day.\nWe had found a huge void, a stone dropped\nfrom which took four seconds to hit the floor.\nWe rejoiced! After putting in a number of\nbolts we hit the end of the rope. We\nconnected two more ropes to the end and\ndescended but were still dangling in free\nspace. Believing the floor to be another 15m down, we attached another rope. It wasn't enough, the end hung about 20m from the\nfloor! This was our last rope and our last day\nof caving...\nWe'll be back next year!\nCaving Club After twenty four hours of solid driving down\nto Slovenia we were about ready to stretch\nour legs a little by climbing up a mountain. It\ntook several days to transport all our\nequipment and most of our food for six weeks\nup to 1500m and all the essential items for a comfortable base and safe caving on a plateau\nat 1800m. Then the real work could begin.\nThe purpose of the expedition was to\nfind, explore and survey new caves. Our camp\nwas located on the Migovec plateau, a wilderness of broken limestone, shake holes\nand dwarf pine. The area has, in theory, one\nof the best potentials for depth of caves in\nEurope, yet the local caving club JSPDT had\ninsufficient human resources to give it the\nattention it deserved. With close support\nfrom JSPDT, Imperial College Cavers moved\nin, this year a team of approximately ten\npeople with a range of caving experience.\nWe started by going head first, bottoms\nup into every promising entrance we\nstumbled across and then marking them for\nfuture exploration. There were literally\nhundreds of potential caves. The plateau,\nroughly 1 x Vi km in size, was heavily pitted\nwith shake holes, tunnels and shafts, large and\nsmall (but generally tight and sharp). Even\nworking in small teams this took several days\nand a sacrifice of shredding t shirts for the\ncause. We had some hints as to which\nentrances were likely to lead into a cave\nsystem. Four club members had visited the\nplateau when it had laid under several metres\nof snow. They had fallen down, marked and\nrecorded the coordinates of more than 50\nsnow chimneys which allowed the cave below\nto 'breathe'. Finding the small splodge s of\npaint, however, in this limestone jungle was\nno easy task. Those breathing holes that were\nrelocated turned out to be no bigger than a Stop Smoking Group\nThe next Stop Smoking group will start on\nWednesday 8th November at 12:15pm. each\nmeeting will last for an hour and there will\nbe 4 more weekly meetings, making 5\naltogether. The groups are often small,\nmaximum 10 people, and are open to all\nstudents and staff of IC.\nFor further details contact Margaret\nReddoch on extension 49393 / 49375.\nCareers Information\nThere are two Careers Talks this coming\nweek in the Clore Lecture Theatre (Huxley\nLT 213) at 1 - 1.50pm.

FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 1 3TH1995 DIARY\nSailing The exams were finally over and the Sailing\nClub were frantically trying to lose their\nhangovers before going to the International\n24hr Race in Coleraine, N. Ireland. The club\nhave participated in the oldest 24hr race,\nsince it's inception.\nAfter the crossing we had time to see the\nsights. First up was a visit to the Giants\nCauseway followed by a visit to the Old\nBushmill Distillery. Tony had spent months\npreparing for this moment by reading the\n'Bluffers Guide to\nWhiskey'. Paul used\nan alternative method to become a, connoisseur by\nsampling all the\nwhiskies, too many\ntimes each!\nAbout 24 hours\nafter leaving IC we\narrived at Coleraine\nYacht Club to be j Kt greeted by the I exceeding hospitable members\nwho gave us food\nand served us real\nGuinness! Much drink flowed and James was\nunder great pressure to start the Karaoke off,\nwhich he did after Chris and Ben, to form, by\nall accounts, an appa ling trio. James couldn't focus on the words, Ben couldn't sing and\nChris turned the microphone off! We\nfinalised team names with the old boys\ndeciding on Team \"Old Farts\" but the young\nupstarts were much more original with Team\n\"That's what my ex-girlfriend used to say.\"\nThe drinking continued well into the\nnight until the Commodore-elect, having\nbeen voted in on the basis that he would be\nvery friendly to everyone, thought it would\nbe rude not to go to talk to a girl from\nBradford Uni. After making his move, 13\nunsubtle comments were shouted across the\nroom as he was chatting to her, causing him\nto make a sharp exit!\nIt was 12pm Saturday morning as the\nRude Boys crossed the start line in a reasonable position for Team \"Ex-Girlfriend\"\nonly to ground on a sand bank shortly after.\nThey managed to extricate themselves from\nthis nasty situation only to find everyone else\non the horizon. Never mind 23 hours 50\nminutes to go!\nJames and Sarah swapped with the Rude\nBoys after a few hours. Sarah, never having\nstepped in a dinghy before, soon worked out\nwhat bit of string to pull and when to pull it\nand all was going well until James capsized.\nSarah coped admirably well but the deck of\nthe boat was still an inch under the water\nafter righting. The next leg of the race was\nspent bailing out as fast as possible to avoid\nbecoming a submarine!\nThe results were posted hourly and\nTeam \"Ex-Girlfriend\" were around 7th while\nTeam \"Old Farts\" were a place or two higher\nas it got dark. The wind dropped as night fell\nand then the 'Fireflies' came into their own,\nsailing well up to their handicap. Those that\nweren't sailing took advantage of the Barbie\nand disco.\nThe night shift was a nightmare! Getting\nwoken up at 2am to be told that you have to\nvacate your lovely warm sleeping bag for the\ncold water was tough.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 1 3TH1995. THREE\nRowing Row\nBY TOM Controversy still surrounds\nthe proposed extension of\nImperial College rowing club's boat house.\nThe club hopes to receive\nplanning permission for the \u00a31\nmillion project in November, but\nafter five years of planning and\nnine months of consultation,\nlocal residents are still unhappy\nwith the scheme.\nSports and Leisure Manager\nFrank Murray insists that the\nextension is a vital upgrade of\nfacilities that have remained\nmore or less unchanged for the\nlast sixty years. When it was built\nin 1937, the designers did not see\nthe need to include women's shower rooms, or indoor training\nfacilities.\nBY JEREMY CLARKE\nAND MARK Accommodation fears\nFears have been expressed\nthat Imperial College students\nare increasing becoming victims\nof unscrupulous letting agents,\nwho illegally charge for 'hidden'\ncosts when letting flats and\nhouses. Students, often in a rush\nto secure a place to live before\nterm starts, are being forced to\npay for charges such as 'holding\ndeposits' and 'handling fees'.\nOne group of students put\ndown a deposit of \u00a3350 on a house in Willisden, expecting to\nmove in from the end of\nSeptember. However, on\narriving, they discovered that the\npresent tenants would not be\nmoving out until November,\nleaving them without\naccommodation lor the new\nterm. The agent, Kevin Begoo,\ndisappeared leaving no contact\naddress, and without one the\nstudents cannot take out a court\norder to retrieve their money.\nThey are anxious to trace him\nHowever, neighbours of the\nPutney Embankment site claim\nthat the expansion will destroy\nthe character of the local area.\n\"College is bending over\nbackwards to accommodate local\nresidents wishes,\" Mr Murray\nsaid. He claimed that\nconsul at ions with those affected\nhave resulted in 6 - 7 changes\nand modifications to the plans.\nBill Mason, Boat Club Coach\nsays that they have a water tight\ncase for the spend. Imperial\nCollege rowers have won just\nabout every major competition in\nthe last few years.\nTim Townend, Deputy\nPresident (C&S) was unsympathetic to the locals' comp-la in ts: \"If they live on a river,\nwhat do they expect,\" he said.\nand ask anyone with information\nof his whereabouts to contact\nk.m. jones@ic.ac.uk.\nPat Harvey, Residents'\nAssistant at the Student\nAccommodation Office (SAO)\ntold Felix that although deposits\nare sometimes difficult to\nreclaim, the specific problems of\nthe students mentioned had not\noccurred before. Answering the\ncharge that the SAO is meant to\nvet agents, she said that the it has\ninsufficient funds and staff to\nactively assess the names it\nprovides, so no guarantee of\nsuitability can be given.\nNevertheless, the Office and the\nUnion advisor will act upon\ncomplaints made against any of\nthe names on the lists.\nThe Union Advisor, Minever\nKavlak, suggests that although\nmany agents are \"charging fees\nfor 'holding deposits',\n'administrative fees' and\n'inventory fees'\", students should\nbe prepared to challenge such\nfees. She recommends that if the\namounts charged seem excessive,\nthen they should be reported to\nthe local Trading Standards\nOfficer. She also advises that a complete inventory should be\ncarried out with a witness, and\nthis inventory be given to the\nagent or landlord. \"Holding\ndeposits are not good practice\nand should be challenged\" she\nsays, \"nor can agents charge for\nyour details.\"\nFurther advice is available\nfrom the Housing Rights Guide\nwhich can be obtained from the\nUnion or the SAO. Beit Manoeuvres\nIan Caldwell and Ian Frame\nof the Estates Division have\ncalled for better communication\nwith Imperial College Union\n(ICU) over the proposed move of\nthe union offices. The four ICU sabbatical officers met the estates\ndirectors on Monday after a letter from the ICU executive to\nthe department and articles in\nFelix emphasised the concerns of\nthe student body.\nIn an amicable yet frank\nmeeting, Mr Caldwell\nemphasised that Estates had the\nunion's best interests at heart.\nTim Townend, Deputy\nPresident, expressed concern\nthat alternative proposals to\nexpand the student facilities in\ntheir current Beit Quad location\nhad not been considered.\nOn Tuesday night the\nStudent Council voted to back a request to the College from the\nexecutive . This requests funds to\nhelp study the viability of ICU's plans for Beit. Sarah White, ICU President explained the plans to\nmove the Union offices and Felix\nto the front of Beit Quad, with\nthe Bar and the Lounge enlarging\ninto the freed-up space on the\nground floor. The rest of Beit\ncould then be developed for\nconferences, and the extra\nstudents could be\naccommodated.\nSarah reiterated her\nscepticism of the props ed plans\nto move. It would be \"...like a sports centre in the middle of\nSherfield\" and at odds with\nstudent's interests, she said. Dr.\nEastwood, Director of Planning,\nput it that the feasibility\nstudy had managed to make an\namalgamation of the Union and a cut down administration\nworkable in the building.\nThe plans stem from an idea\nsuggested by architects Sir\nNorman Foster and Partners that\nthe college lacked 'a heart', and\n\n"
