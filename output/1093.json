    "content": "SPORT 10 October 1997\nWorld Championships a breeze for sailors\nChris Balding (Physics III) and\nAndy Smith (Materials III) returned\nfrom Canada this summer with\nplenty of trophies and memories to\nshout about. Both of them were\ncompeting in the British team in\nthe \"Mirror Dinghy\" World\nChampionships on Lake Ontario at\nthe Portsmouth Olympic Harbour,\nKingston. Against tough competition from eight different nations\nincluding Australia, South Africa,\nUSA, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and\njapan counting a total of 100\nboats, Chris and crew Nikki Harper\nwalked away with the title with\nAndy and crew Robyn Still in a credible 28th. The winning pair sailed a consistent ten race series never finishing outside the top ten, winning\ntwo races and two \"day series\".\nHowever the result was not decided until the last race when rivals\nRoss Killian and crew Darren\nMcCann (IRL) and Dave Gebahard\ncrewed by his son Joshua (GBR)\nneeded to win with Balding outside\nthe top eight. At one stage this\nlooked possible with Killian in second and Balding in ninth but the\nrace ended with Killian in second,\nBalding in sixth and Gebhard in\nseventh.\nThe British also narrowly beat\nthe Irish to the team prize of the\nhighest place top three boats with\n1st( Balding), 3rd( Gebhard) and\n6th( Ian Capener crewed by daughter Fay).\nSailing club commodore, the\ndynamic Simon Keen, was quoted\nas saying, \"This was a superb result\nand hopefully the publicity will\nattract more aspiring sailors to our\n(cabin) door.\"\n[Hearty congratulations from all\nat the Felix office - Si]\nNikki and Chris in jubilant mood\nNews\nThere really weren't many actual\nmatches going on, but there\nwere many, many team-trials.\nOne club whose trial was a superb spectacle was IC AFC\nwhere many potential stars\nshowed their stuff to the\nenthralled onlookers. It's not too\nlate to try out for the biggest and\nbest football club at IC as there is\nanother trial this Saturday. If you\nare interested in playing, at any\nstandard, then come to Beit\nQuad at 12:30 with boots and\nshin pads (and shorts, socks and\naT shirt if you can manage it).\nTeam captains - get any\ninterested team members to the\nFelix office on Tuesdays at 1 pm\nfor the sports meeting. Also,\nplease bring any results into the\noffice.\nCheers, SI.\nBcxiUi ttl ail AND SNOWBOARD( f> SHOW A Golly gosh, ski show freebies\nThe 1997 Daily Mail Ski and\nSnowboard Show with Mitsubishi\nShowgun is going to be bigger and\nbetter than ever before. The exhibition takes place at Olympia from\n31 October to 9 November and\ngives you the opportunity to visit\nspectacular attractions, such as the\nfull size artificial ski slope, which\nnot only hosts amazing live demon-st rations, but gives visitors the\nopportunity to ski and receive\nexpert tuition. The Quarter Pipe will\nhost regular snowboarding displays\nby top professionals and feature\nthe latest in ski and snowboard\nfashions.\nWe have 15 paris of tickets\n(worth \u00a39 each) to give away. Just\ncome into the office, say \"make\nmine a Daily Mail Ski Double\nplease!\" and we'll hand them over.\nIf you haven't found the office yet,\nit's hidden in a corner of Beit Quad\n- just follow the signs.\nIf you're not one of the lucky\nwinners, then call the ticket hotline\non 0121 767 4433, quoting ref\nFEL, for a special discount of \u00a32 off\ntickets (75p booking fee per order)\nfor both London and Birmingham\nshows.\nBishop takes Queen shock\nLast week the chess club's1st team,\nMiddlesex League Champions for 1995/96\nand 1996/97, started the new season with a comfortable win at home against International\nStudents House. Such was our superiority that\na walkover was likely, but careless play left the\nscore line at 6-2.\nJon Hastings was unable to make any impression against a tired opponent who could hardly keep his eyes open and looking at the board,\nso a quick draw was agreed on board 1.\nNatasha Regan won with an overwhelming\nattack on the king's side. Rob Lothian\nmanoeuvre d his pieces badly and allowed his\nopponent to get a very troublesome extra\npawn, which proved to be his downfall.\nOn board 4 captain Dom Goodwin spent a lot of time thinking only to reach a dull mid-dle game. To liven things up he tried a complicated tactic which led to a tricky ending. His\nopponent lost his queen and ran out of time\non the same move. Nick Moloney played\nagainst the incredibly ugly and hairy\n\"Kobollocks\" who won a pawn but failed to\npress home his advantage. Nick pushed his\nown isolated pawn on to promotion and\n\"Kobollocks\" resigned. Chris Greenshields\nswiftly obtained a crushing position and easily defeated his clueless opponent.\nGavin Knott got into a very dire position\nindeed, but somehow survived and the game\nfizzled out to a draw. Easily bored, Dave Tang\nspent only 30 minutes at the board during the\n3-hour session. Which is probably why his\noffended opponent refused to resign and\ninstead forced a pointless continuation.\nChess problem: White to move - how can\nhe take advantage of Black's awkward pos i tion?\nBarry Cale\nbC "

    "content": "Sjfe? 10 NEWS FEATURE lO Octo bei Like Blood from a The News Team lifts the lid on the controversial Dearing Report on the future of\nHigher Education funding. The question is: can you afford not to read this?\nThe De a ring Report The National Committee of Inquiry\ninto Higher Education - the socalled 'Dearing Committee' - was\nset up in May 1996 by the then\nConservative Government to\nexamine ways in which the higher\neducation system could develop,\nprimarily over the following two\ndecades. The committee, chaired\nby Sir Ron Dearing, consisted of\nseventeen members including the\nRector of Imperial College, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh. It also comprised\nof senior staff from Exeter,\nStrathclyde, Glamorgan and Open\nUniversities, and a student representative from the University of\nWales in Cardiff as well as a range\nof industry moguls.\nMore than ninety recommendations were made by the commit-tee, concerning a whole range of\nissues such as the setting up of\nQuality Agencies and the establishment of formal training courses for\nlecturers. The biggest controversy\nhowever appears to be the com-mitte e's suggestions that students\nshould contribute more to the cost\nThe Bottom Line\nIn the table opposite \"Higher\nIncome\" families are regarded as\nthose with income over \u00a334,000\nafter deductions for such matters as\npension contributions and mortgage interest. The \"Lower Income\"\ngroup refers to those households\nwith earnings of less than \u00a316,450\nper annum.\nMaintenance Grant is currently\npaid by Local Education Authorities, means tested on the basis\nof parental income. Maintenance\nLoan currently comes from the\npublicly owned Student Loans\nCompany, with plans to privat is e this debt in development. Parental\ncontribution is that which the\nGovernment expects guardians to\ngive their student children.\nof their education, only to have the\nnewly-installed Labour government\ncome to a different decision on\nmatter on the eve of the report's publication last July.\nAfter behind-the-scenes discussions with the National Union of\nStudents, ministers attempted to\nease the potential unpopularity of\nall students paying \u00a3 1000 per head\nby agreeing to a means-test. This\nwould results in the poorest students paying nothing and the\nwealthier ones pay the full fee.\nThe Government announced its\nintention to replace student grants\nwith loans, also contrary to the\nDearing recommendations which\ntried not to deter poorer students\nfrom the higher education. The\nMinister for Higher Education,\nBaroness Blackstone, said the NUS\n\"have publicly said... that they are\nunhappy with Dearing proposals to\ncharge for tuition. We are trying to\nmitigate Dearing's proposals by\nexcluding low-income students.\"\nShe did concede however that\nricher students would \"still be paying less in terms of the loan repayments than a student from low\nincome family who will have a somewhat larger loan.\" For its part\nthe NUS president, Douglas\nTrainer, said \"We are very pleased\nabout the decision on means-test-ing fees but we believe the principle of fees is wrong and we will\ncampaign against this.\"\nAlthough Sir Ron Dearing himself played down the sidelining of\nthese proposals, some members of\nhis committee were said to be 'furious' over the government's public\nairing of its own proposals before\nthe report's publication. \"It is a matter of serious regret that the\ngovernment should come to a decision in private without first listening to the responses of the\ncommittee's recommendations.\"\nAnother said \"The problem is that\nwhat the Government has come up\nwith is a half-way house, and not\nsurprisingly, it is a mess. For the\ngovernment not to allow time for a debate on our recommendations is\ndeplorable.\" University heads also\nexpressed doubts. \"We have a big\nquestion whether today's proposals will meet the funding gap that\nthe government itself ac knowl edges,\" said Diana Warwick, chief\nexecutive of the CVCP. Baroness\nBlackstone attempted to assure\nuniversities that any extra money\nraised would go to HE funding.\nOther proposals put forward by\nthe Dearing Committee covered\nmatters ranging from the aims and\npurposes of higher education, and\nuse of information technology - the\nlatter recommending that all\nstudents have access to desktop\ncomputers by the year 2001 and\nthat students have their own laptops by the 2006.\nThe role and qualities of staff\nwas also addressed. The committee remarked that there was concern among academic staff that the\nesteem of their profession needed\nraising, and noted that staff in HE\nare paid much less than comparable jobs in both the private and\npublic sectors.\nCurrent System\nMaintenance Grant\nMaintenance Loan\ni erin come Middle Income\n\u00a3 0 \u00a3 1 0 8 0\n\u00a3 2 0 8 5 \u00a3 2 0 8 5\nParental contribution to maintenance \u00a3 2 1 6 0 \u00a3 1 0 8 0\nTuition fees Paid by Local Education Authority\nNew System\nMaintenance Grant\nMaintenance Loan\nHigher Income\nAbolished \u00a3 3 0 8 5\nParental contribution to maintenance \u00a3 1 1 6 0\nTuition fees \u00a3 1 0 0 0\n\u00a3 4 1 6 5\n\u00a3 8 0\n\u00a3 1 0 0 0\nLower Income\n\u00a3 2 1 6 0\n\u00a3 2 0 8 5\n\u00a3 0\nMiddle Income Lower Income\n\u00a3 4 2 4 5\n\u00a3 0\n\u00a3 0\n997 NEWS FEATURE\nStone? Mr Simon Wright, Education and Welfare\nOfficer from the University of Wales at\nCardiff, entranced by discussion during a visit by delegates from the Dearing Commission to Imperial College Union earlier this\nyear. The Rector of Imperial College, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh, also attended the meeting\nand was one of seven academics on the seventeen member committee. Others involved\nin the review included representatives from\nGlaxo Wellcome, Psion, Ulster Bank and the\nWeir Group.\nThe Latest\nA full and frank discussion\nWhat was predicted as being the\ncontentious issue of the Labour\nParty Conference, held at the end\nof September in Brighton, turned\ninto a non-event as the party\nmachine closed in on potential\nrebels. A raft of pre-conference\nmotions criticising the\nGovernment's plans to charge students tuition fees and abandon the\nlong cherished policy of free education promised heated debate.\nIn the event only two delegates\nbraved the wrath of their party\nleader and spoke out against proposals and insisted that education\nshould be \"inclusive not exclusive\".\nAs a first year student at\nStrathclyde University, Johanna\nBaxter had less to lose than most.\nThe only other delegate unwilling\nto publicly toe the line was Maria\nExali of the Communication\nWorkers Union, who questioned\nhow the Secretary of State for\nEducation could \"stand and claim\nyou want to create more equality\nof access and introduce a method\nof funding that undermines that\nvery principle?\"\nFacing certain defeat, after\nDavid Blunkett's rousing defence of\nthe government's proposals, delegates opposing the move withdrew\ntheir motion.\nGap year policy finally filled\nAfter weeks of deliberations, with\n'sources' suggesting that those\ncarrying out charity work during\ntheir gap year could receive preferential treatment, on 13th August\nthe Government agreed to exempt\nall students wishing to take a year\nout from the new funding regime.\nBaroness Blackstone's statement\nfollowed her condemnation a week\nearlier of press speculation,\ndescribing it as \"irresponsible\nscare mongering\". These announcements came\ntoo late for the estimated 1 7,000\nstudents who panicked into abandoning deferred entry in favour of\nensuring a less debt-laden e duca tion. While the Committee of ViceChancellors and Principals insisted\nthat universities would be able to\n\"cope\" and the Government\nannounced that the increase was\n\"manageable\".\nThe extra students, which represent 6% of the planned first year\npopulation, could result in universities being surcharged by the\nGovernment. Imperial College's200 extra fresher s could cost dearly as each educational establishment is only allowed a2% margin\nfrom its target intake.\nMass Expansion - of 2.5%\nConfusion broke out in the wake of\ncontrasting statements from the\nPrime Minister and the Secretary of\nState for Education over the expansion in student numbers. Tony Blair\nannounced during the Labour Party\nConference that his Government\nwould \"lift the cap on student\nnumbers and set a target for an\nextra 500,000 people into higher\nand further education by 2002.\"\nThis ambitious target seemed\nto be at odds with David Blunkett's earlier suggestion that he would\nseek places for an extra 40,000 or\n50,000 students. This would represent an increase in the participation rate of 18-21 year olds from\nthe current 32.5% to 35%. The confusion exposed by these differing\ndeclaration is expected to be\ncleared up by the publication of the\nGovernment's detailed plans for\nhigher education - expected in\nNovember.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 10 October 1997\nICU Plans\ntake shape\nNews in Brief..\nThe Union's desperate need for\nincreased space was addressed by\nEric Allsop on Tuesday in a presentation to the Union Executive\nCommittee. The presentation,\ncreated for the Beit Development\nCommittee, describes pressures on\nexisting facilities and possible solutions. The greatest pressure points\nwere highlighted and the President\nnoted that \"expansion of social and\nrecreational space within the college has not kept pace with student numbers since 1960\". Next\nyear the opening of the BMS building and the resultant increase in the\nstudent population of nearly 25%\nwill worsen these pressures.\nThe impending removal of the\nBiology department from Beit\nQuad to the new Biomedical\nCentre in 1998 will vacate much of\nthe space in the Beit building. Most\nof this is due to be converted to\nnew student rooms, but there are\nsome areas, particularly the base-ment s, which are unsuitable for\naccommodation. It was recommended by the Rector's Working\nParty on Social and Recreational\nSpace that the Union expand into\nthis available area, a move which\nCollege has all but guaranteed.\nThe suggestions made in the\npresentation for the use of the\nbasement include changing and\nshower facilities, storage facilities,\nFelix, STOIC, IC Radio and the Print\nUnit as well as new amenities the\nUnion does not have at present\nsuch as a laundry room.\nSubstantial changes and relocation s within the present Union\nBuilding were also proposed,\nincluding a new lounge and canteen on the first floor and a mezzanine level in the gym to house the\noffices. The project aims to\nimprove the and rational is e the\nbuilding for administration, clubs,\nmeeting space and ents. Eric\nAllsop said that dBs was always\nintended to extend into the space\noccupied by Felix and the Print Unit\nand this is a great necessity. When\ncomparing it with similar student\nunions \"dBs holds 250... the average size of a venue is over 850\".\nIt is unlikely that the College\nwill provide money for developments in the current space and the\ntime to complete the renovations\nwas estimated at about 5 years.\nThe expansion of dBs into the Felix\nand Print Unit is provisionally\nplanned for summer 1998.\nThe presentation will be given\nagain at the Union Council (the\nlarge student committee that gov-erm s the Union) on Tuesday 14\nOctober at 6.00pm in the Union\nDining Hall. Council is open to\neveryone at Imperial College.\nMahlina\ni Ents & catering\nEric Allsop's proposal for the Union Building\nCLAYPONDS\nTHEFTS RESTART\nThe desktop part of a computer\nand a hi-fi system were stolen\nfrom a student's room in\nClayponds on Sunday night. The\nstudent's room was on the\nground floor and the victim had\nonly used a small domestic lock\nto fasten the window shut. Extra\nlocks have been added to all the\nwindows of Clayponds' ground\nfloor rooms as the domestic lock\nsupplied with the windows are\nnot sufficient to prevent thieves\nfrom gaining direct access to personal possessions. It is believed\nthat the culprit comes from a nearby council estate.\nThis is the third incident to occur\nin as many weeks involving someone with no affiliation with\nImperial College being able to get\nin to Halls of Residence. This raises the question of whether the\nnew dog patrols and increased\nsecurity measures are having an\neffect on criminal activity at all.\nHowever, students are being\nurged to be vigilant and lock windows and doors securely when\nthey leave their rooms.\nPOLICE DIFFUSE\nFAIR TROUBLE\nThe militant Islamic group,\nHizb-ut-Tahrir visited Imperial\nCollege Freshers' Fair once\nagain this year, despite the ban.\nSetting up their stand just outside the entrance to Beit Quad,\nthree men from the radical\ngroup handed out booklets and\npapers telling of the Koran and\n\"The Massacres of Algeria to\nSlaughter Islam as an Ideology\nand a System\". They appeared\nat the start of the Fair and were\nonly told to leave by security at\naround 5.00pm after a complaint from the Biology depart-ment. Two police constables\nwere called in to give an extra\nemphasis and the group, made\nup of graduates from LSE, UCL\nand Westminster Universities,\ndisappeared swiftly.\nEQUIPMENT\nAlthough the Freshers' Ball was\nenjoyed by many of those who\nattended the first big party of the\nyear, it was marred by the theft of\na tape deck and graphic equalise r from one of the rooms being used\nfor dancing and music in the\nUnion. The items be log ned to the\nDramatic Society and were worth\nan estimated \u00a3 1,500. The thieves\nremoved numerous screws to\nrelease the units from the racking\nand stole the equipment at\naround 4am as the Ball was winding down and the Union Staff\nwere closing up. However, the\nequipment reappeared in an\nunmarked box at Beit Security\nOffice at around 7.30pm the next\nday.\nNEW AGENTS\nThe Imperial College Union\nNewsagents on the Sherfield\nWalkway has just received a complete overhaul. The small\nshop was poorly designed and\nrun-down, but the new layout\nshould allow for better circulation and improved stock dis-plays. Although the newsagents\nis open, the work will not be\ncompleted until next week.\nBLOW FOR\nBELEAGUERED\nBOOKSTORE\nNews has just reached Felix that\nthe college-run Southside Shop,\nlocated below the Southside hall\nof residence, has begun selling\nstationary products. This is in\ndirect com pet ion with the IC\nUnion shop on the walkway, previously known as the Bookstore.\nIn a controversial move last year,\ncollege administration awarded\nthe tender for the new bookshop\nin the library to Waterstone's. It\nthen forced ICU to halt book sell-ing, removing their stock by compulsory purchase. The store had\nbeen bringing in about \u00a370,000\nprofit annually, all of which was\ninvested in the Union.\n\n"

But\nM Wk two hours of sound-checking and a cancelled Live TV interview later, /on\nTrout and Rob Timson were having a chat and a bev vy with the\ngreat radio gurus and Shire\nHorses founders Mark Radcliffe\nand the Boy Lard.\nJon Trout Are yous nervous, lads?\nMark Radcliffe We weren't nervous before we started sound\nchecking, but we're absolutely\nbricking it now.\nJon The original artists of the bands\nthat The Shirehorses cover; what\ndo they reckon of it all?\nMark Most of them have seen it as\na kind of tribute, and well intention ed and that. They have to see\nthem that way 'cos we wrote them\nfirst. If they don't let us have it\nwe'll tell the true story. We've had\na couple of people who've said 'On\nYer Bike Lads', including Hanson...\nJon There's a surprise...\nMark Yeah, big surprise; well, if you\ncan't say that someone is a precocious little get without them getting\nuppity...\nMark 'Lard' Riley Well they're a precocious little get.\nMark Enough said. I think that we\nwere a bit close to the bone there;\nand also, the Chemical Toilet\nBrothers wouldn't let us do it.\nJon &. Rob Timson Really?\nMark That.su j l rise d me. That did\nsurprise me.

She\ncame in with a pint pot\nof Gin and Tonic\nbe on one at the moment. He's doing all right. Difficult question. 1\nlike what he does on the telly more\nthan he ever did on the radio, but I didn't hear that much of the radio,\nso I'm not the best judge. Is that\ndiplomatic enough? He's done the\ndeed, he's achieved what he wanted to achieve, lots of quids in the\nbank, lots of birds, he's done well.\nJon I don't know if you heard the\nBreakfast Show the week after\nDiana's death; Kevin Greening was\non and, well, we weren't fans of\nthe way he did it. 1 was wondering\nhow you would have handled that?\nMark Well, I didn't hear it, 1 never\nlisten to the radio when we're on\nholiday, because a) It's a like a bus-man's holiday b) just in case they\nare better than us. But, you know,\nwe were deemed sort of unsuitable\nto broadcast to a nation in national\nmourning, but I genuinely think that\nwe would have been all right, you\nknow. We're not funny anyway, so\nwhen people say we could have\ncut out the jokes, it's easy.\nLard There's none there to begin\nwith.\nRob So you were told that you\ncouldn't go on then?\nMark No, what we were told was\nthat Kevin Greening had handled it\nall so ^sensitively and had led the\naudience through it.\nRob Did ri fish it e... he ripped the piss\nout of her so much when she was\nalive an ere.\nLard Well, vo.i know. It was a diff i cb sort of thing TO go thi oi gh Radio One dignity was right at the\nforefront, and so if they did make a bollocks of it then everyone would\nit, and\n...vay at\nthe time and they tried to get in\ntouch with us to see if we wanted\nto come back in the thick of it.

Although it\nturned out there might have been\nanother agenda...\nLard Aye.\nJon So what is the story about the\nBreakfast Show?\nLard We're not doing it anymore.\nMark We are not leaving, we've\nbeen forcibly ejected... The\nabsolute truth of it all is that we\nwere going to do the afternoons;\nwe really enjoyed the nights, but\nwe were doing it for three and a half years, and it's long enough to\nwork nights, and it's long enough\nto do the same show, and so we\nwere going to go onto the after-noon s, and then Chris Evans left,\nand Mathew Bannister phoned and\nsaid 'will you do the Breakfast\nShow?' and we said 'No'.\nJon And then they offered you a big\nsack of cash...\nMark Yeah, to be absolutely hon-est, yeah, it was partially the fact\nthat is was the biggest show in the\ncountry, and you think, you know,\nwell maybe we shouldn't turn it\ndown, and it was also money, it\nwas greed. It was pure greed on\nour part. We had done it before,\nbut we didn't want to do it.\nLard And also, Mathew, who's always really been behind Mark,\nwhen he came back to us, he said\n'I would treat it as a real personal\nfavour if you would do this for me'\nand it was a bit hard to say no.\nMark But then, we were aware that\nthey weren't that happy with it in\nterms of the audience, but the timing of it was-iia, surprise, I 'll say\nthat... j gj \u00a3 j Jon W.e ning show do you think that you could\nnot translate to the morning show\n. \u2022 ; \" ' . i;::c' \u2022 \u2022 \\ / >\nMark All of 'em.\naspects of the old show was th.it\nyou could come out of an obscure\nsurf rock thing and go straight into\n\u2022-: s: sQ'-M': \u2022\nMark We did used to do poetry in\nthe first half hour, but you probably\ndidn't. \"\u2022 = . - \u2022 ;\nMark\ncom; rence s, weil there we . one, the\nmi sic. going onto the pl.iy list, which knew\nth a jt ji \u2022\u2022\u2022as not\nb ig able to chat at length with\nour g/M^ Rk\nJBlllil* 1111 \" : V;s ll ll ii TELL ALL\nby Jon Trout and Rob Tim son m^ Rob I think that the comedy\nworked better with the pauses as\nwell. Did they complain about dead\nair?\nMark Well, you know, they are\nfrightened of it, and we had to put\nmusic under it when we were talking which we never did at night.\nOne criticism that we got was that\nour audience was selective; if you\nliked it, you really liked it, and we\nwere quite proud of that, but get\njudged against that [The Evening\nShow] but it is finished and whatever happens we will never go back\nand try to recreate it.\nJon All the time that you were on\nthe radio, who was your favourite\nguest?\nMark [long pause] Kylie Minogue!\nLard We liked her...\nMark No, our favourite guests were\nnot big stars, but people we had a rapport with at night, and the\nnames that spring to mind particularly would be; Stuart Maconie,\nKatie Puckrick, Will Self in the early\ndays, and Simon Armitage. Those\nwere probably my big favourites;\nMark Kermode, because we used to\nhave a laugh. We felt that the rapport that we shared with them was\npassed onto the listeners as well.\nWe kind of quite miss that in a way,\nmore than anything else. It was just\nlike seeing your mates really.\nJon Who was the most pissed person who's ever been on the show?\nMark Now then, I would think that\nDebbie Harry, she was hard work,\nshe was absolutely slaughtered.\nLaid Steaming, weren't she...\nMark She'd had j;, a gig at the\nManchester Apollo.

    "content": "10 October 1997\nINTERVIEW AND VIDEO\nReleased today, House of\nAmerica is an endearing low-budget film which tells the tale of\na family trapped without a future\nin a bleak Welsh village. It\nmovingly portrays the despair felt\nby the impoverished young in\nsmall towns everywhere, and\nshows how this can lead to a downward spiral which ruins\nlives. The film, reviewed on this\npage, marks the debut of Welsh\ndirector Marc Evans and Felix\ncaught up with him for a cup of\ntea and a chat...\nFelix: Are you worried that the\npublic has had enough of Wales\nafter Twin Town?\nMarc: Not at all. Making a film\nabout Wales is like making a film\nabout being thin - so what?\nBesides, the feeling of not being\nable to escape from a hopeless life\nis felt everywhere; in the Welsh val-leys, in England, all over the world.\nFelix: Are you worried that it\nwill be seen as just another Britpop\nfilm full of music by the likes of\nBlur?\nMarc: As for the music, it was\njust a case of what seamless ly fits\ninto the film whilst reflecting the\ncharacters' view of America. For\nMam, for example, an old women\nwhose view of America is dominated by Las Vegas and glitter, we had\nmusic by Tom Jones. For the kids\nFILM 19\nSTUDIO NEWS\nwhose view is of endless highways\nwith the car stereo blaring we went\nfor the corresponding type of\nmusic, like the Prodigy. If the music\nwe could afford on our 1.3 million\nbudget happened to be popular\nstuff all the better.\nFelix: How common do you\nthink is the kind of dreaming we\nsee from the kids in the film?\nMarc: Hard to say. Everyone\nimagines they're in their own film\nsometimes. When a blok e is in his\nRobin Reliant speeding through a Welsh valley he starts to think he's starring in his own film, on a Harley\ngoing across America. Alternatively\nhe just pops his pills, gets pissed\nand escapes from the monotony\nthat way.\nFelix: What's the reaction been\nlike so far?\nMarc: Very good. It's been\nshown at several festivals including\nEdinburgh and it's gone down well.\nWe're taking it over to Hamburg\nnext month and are hoping to get\nspotted by a big US distributor\nsome time. 1 reckon there's a good\nmarket over there for real independent films like House of America,\nespecially as they have a similar situation to the town in the film in\nmany of their areas. Whatever hap-pens, I'm proud of my film and any\nsuccess is a bonus, Q RED SHOE DIARIES:\nAUTO EROTICA\nVideo Retail. \u00a312.99\nIt's not often you\nsee erotica for\nwoman in the video\nsection of HMV. But\nthe Red Shoe Diaries\nis exactly that - a mainstream series\nshown in America\nwhich is aimed solely\nat women instead of old men in\ndirty macs. And best of all, it stars\nthat famous Seeker of The Truth,\nDavid Duchovny.\nThe series, released over here\nlast week, consists of stories linked\nonly by Duchovny as Jake. In Auto\nErotica, Jake has put an advert in\nthe lonely hearts column of his\npaper and receives replies from a variety of women who describe\ntheir love lives in explicit detail.\nThis may sound like the usual late-night dod gy stuff but it's very different. If anything the scenes are\nbuilt up too slowly, with too much\nflashy camera work and dialogue.\nStill, it's probably the right sort of\nthing for a Girls' Night In. |J Thanks to the generous\npeople at Vision Replay Ltd we\nhave two copies of Auto Erotica\nto give away. The first two\nfemales in the Felix Office on\nFriday will win one and don't worry, we'll deliver the prizes in\nplain brown envelopes.\nFit m MP1T1TION\nODEON\nKENSINGTON\nThis week the Odeon is offering five pairs of tickets\nto see Nil By Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary\nOldman. Produced by Luc Besson, this semi-auto bio graphical account of a family growing up in a rough\nSouth London council block certainly pulls no punch-es. The bleak reality of lives ruined by every kind of\naddiction is shoved in the viewer's face at every\nopportunity, as is the domestic violence suffered by\nthe main character's wife.\nThe film is based on Oldman's experiences of\nliving with an alcoholic father, something that led to\nhim being an alcoholic himself for twenty years. Nil by\nMouth will definitely affect you one way or another, be\nit making you walk out half way through or wanting to\nchange the world when it's finished. It's a rare film that\nis brave enough to discomfort the viewer this much.\nTo win one of the five pairs of tickets drop your\nname and the answer to the following question into\nthe Felix Office by midday on Tuesday:\nOne of the producers of Nil By Mouth directed\nGary Oldman in two recent films. Name the\ndirector and the films.\nThe winners of last week's competition who knew)\nthat Sigourney Weaver is starring in next month's Alien 4 are:\nBen White\nReuben Connolly\nStephen Tarlton\nMarie-Eve Bizien\nColumbia must be IV^ti\nregretting signing up Alicia '\nSilverstone to produce and star in\ntwo new films. The first, Excess\nBaggage, was released last month\nand flopped badly, leading to suggestions that the studio should cut\ntheir losses and drop the young\nstar. They're keeping faith with\nher, however, believing that they\nhave to be seen as \"talent friendly\"\nif they're to attract the top stars to\nsimilar deals.\nNew studio DreamWorks is\nalso sulking after its first film, The\nPeacemaker, performed far worse\nthan expected in its initial two\nweeks. After grossing a disappointing $ 12.3m in its first weekend it\ndropped to just $8.3m last week,\nleaving it third in the box office\ncharts. This coincides with critics\nbeginning to turn against the film's star, George Clooney, as they suggest his cardboard acting is\nrestricted to shy sideways glances.\nThings are not looking good for the\nER man after successive flops with\nBatman & Robin and One Fine Day.\nLast weekend's American Top\nTen looked like this:\n1. Kiss The Girls $ 13.4m2. Soul Food $8.4m3. The Peacemaker $8.3m4. In and Out $8.1m5. The Edge $5.2m6. LA Confidential $4.5m7. The Game $3.1m8.U Turn $2.6m9. The Full Monty $2.3m10. Wishmaster $1.5m Disney and Fox are preparing\nfor a showdown over the latter's new animated film, Anastasia.\nDisney is determined to remain\nthe number one cartoon studio\nand so is pre-empting Fox's film by\nre-releasing The Little Mermaid\ntwo weeks earlier. Fox chairman\nPeter Chernin is not happy, complaining that \"Disney is determined\nto do anything they can to stop the\nsuccess of Anastasia.\" It's not the\nonly thing Chernin has to worry\nabout. Titanic, the most expensive\nfilm ever made, is set for a worldwide release in December, meaning it will be an anxious Christmas\nfor Fox's executives. O "

    "content": "10 October 1997\nALBUMS\nMUSIC 17\nTHE SPACEMONKEYS\nThe Daddy Of Them All \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe\nSpacemonkeys\ncoming to a planet near\nyou soon.\nThis is an album that\ncont an s a lot of differ-en ces. From the first\ntrack, Acid House Killed\nRock And Roll, to the last, March\nOF The Scarecrows, there is a gradual change in style and approach.\nThis is nothing to do with any split\npersonality that songwriter Richard\nMcNevin-Duff might have but\nsomething to with the fact that the\nband sees themselves as the next\nbig 'Madchester' thing.\nA bit of history first, though.\nThey formed in 1994 and played\ntheir first gig at the Hacienda in\nManchester in 1995. A week after\nthat, Tony Wilson approached\nthem and asked them to sign on\nthe dotted line for a six-album deal\nwith his label, Factory Records,\nwhom you might have heard of as\nthe label that launched Joy Division\nand Happy Mondays amongst o th ers. They give out an attitude of\nnonchalance towards the music\npress whom they say has completely ignored them so far and\nlook to the public to recognise their\ntalent.\nSo what about the music? Well,\nthey sound Mancunian. However\nmuch they want to tell people that\nthey don't want to start another\nNorthern uprising or anything, they\nwill probably sound like they do.\nThe album is a result of the late-eighties acid house culture app-plied in the late nineties. Big guitar\nloops and chemicals-esque samples drive through tracks like\nBlowing Down The Stylus whilst still\nremaining organic at all times.\nMcNevin-Duff's vocals are an\nintegral part of the differences in\nthe songs. On Sugar Cane, he\nsounds like he's doing an impression of Arrested Development's Speech crossed with the singer of\nE.M.F.( can't remember his name,\nsorry). In a marked contrast, Inside\nMy Soul sounds like something of\nthe last Primal Scream album. A great melody coupled with strings\nand staccato guitar add up to a nice little up-tempo ballad.\nSome of the songs are not\nentirely inspired, though. Dear\nDhina, a melancholic number,\nwhich sounds like any band, anywhere is a good example.\nThings look better towards the\nend of the album when Sweetest\nDream rears its head. This is short,\nsweet and brilliant. It's that simple.\nMarc Of The Supercool brings\nthings to a fine ending which brings\ntogether everything that was good\nabout the whole acid-house era\nand encapsulates it into a seven-minute outro to the album. Wahwah guitar, repetitive lyrics and brilliant sampling make this the best\ntrack on the album.\nThis may be the first time\nyou've ever heard of the\nSpacemonkeys, but make sure you\nkeep and ear out for them in the\nnear future - something tells me\nthat they are going to go places. H Alok\nSINGLES\nKylie Minogue - Some Kind of Bliss\nAnother re-invention, another rock dollar Hey,\ngreat horn section. Hey, great strings. Hey, slick\nproduction. Hey, choke on your own vomit.\nThe Hybrids - Stranded\nNorman Stanley Hybrid, I sentence you to five\nyears for the theft of Neil Young's Down by the\nRiver, two years for the misappropriation of\nNoel Gallagher's voice, and 6 months for joyriding a second-hand chorus 'owned' by Paul\nWeller. This is larceny on a grand scale, and\nmust be punished.\nCable - Cod Give me Gravity\nRather than genuinely unusual, Cable sound like\nStereophonies after a 'weirdness assertion1 weekend, a little too forced. However, the title\ntrack eventually beefs up the guitar sound sufficiently to sweep to a roaring conclusion just\nbehind AC Acoustics. So, the Damoclean vat of\nvitriol remains un tipped at least until next\ntime hur gh, hur gh, hur gh. The Kings of Infinite Space - Speedboarder\nRock and roll the way mom used to make it.\nSpeedboarder (sung in an incongruous East-End\naccent) is The Ramones covering Ministry's Stigmata, while Little Deuce Coupe is exhumed\non Little Black Flower. Can I recommend a slight\nchange in direction? Like, away from my stereo?\nBedlam A Go-Go - Flat 29\nIt may be \"...an arty far ty disco party, rich kids\non smart ies...\", but fundamentally Bedlam A GoGo are not going to be the 'next big thing1, as the\nword on the street would have us believe. Man.\nThey are in fact Jesus Jones with a few ripped-off Chemical beats thrown in, and I freely give\nup ail my 'c red' forthwith.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Strangelove - Freak\nFinally, the Strangelove kids get some balls to\nplay with. I'd always found their sound too\nweak, too whining, and sticky with self-pity. But\nnow all that's been traded in for Jon Spencer\nattitude and a good dollop of self-hatred, delivering a single that pouts like jagger and slaps it's arse like Brett Anderson.\nLibido - Supersonic Daydream\nKinda retro, without being a blatant grave-robber. Kinda T Rex, but with the catchiest bit all\nused up in the first thirty seconds. Fits snugly\nbetween Suede and Subcircus. Thought they\nwere going to be one of my 'kinda1 bands that\nnever really cut it, until I listened to Inner Beauty\nis a Lame Comfort when you're Fuck Bored, and\nhad the skin flayed from my bones by their Jesus\nLizard-style assault. Note: this is a good thing.\nThe Wiidhearts - Urge\nBreathless panting. Echoing vocals from the bottom of a very dark, very scary well. Droning, distorted guitars threatening to overwhelm everything else. An MBV melody curling round the\nbase of your spine. An explosion in a rather\nlarge, noisy factory. ROCK! ROCK!! ROCK!!!\nHmmm, that covers the first seventy seconds.\nRepeat for an awesome five minutes of music\nheavier than Gods' balls and more fucked-up\nthan Keith Richard's kidneys.\nThe Gania Kru - Gone are the Days\nSkip the soul-vocal radio mix and explore the\nseriously good drum and bass remixes courtesy\nof DJ Hype. Roll a fat one, open your shirt to the\nwaist and shuffle round your flat with your arse\ngoing nineteen to the dozen. Oooh, go on.\nDubstar - Cathedral Park\nStellar vocals and guitar, as always, but the exuberant horn section seems to take the edge off\nthe miser a bilis m that Sarah's flat Northern vowels always promise. Still fantastic sparkly pop of\ncourse, just a bit too cheerful.\nGroop Dogdrill - Lovely Skin (Mantra)\nThe start is promising, a cool sample followed\nby an intro in the style of the Dead Kennedys,\nthen it all goes down hill. This song deserves a manic, deranged psychotic singer, not your Dad\ndoing an impression of Rik from Shed 7.LT1\nNorm\n\n"

    "content": "10 October 1997 COLUMNS 9 ^\nReports of my death have been greatly\nexaggerated. You (the denizens of\nSherfield) thought I'd gone. Fat chance.\nThey still haven't found a decent columnist,\nwhich means you're stuck with me. So, in the\nwords of a famous philosopher, nice to see\nyou, to see you nice. This promises to be a fairly eventful year, not just for the fresher s, but\nfor all the inmates as our numbers become\nswelled by our medical friends. May we live in\ninteresting times.\nAt this time, it is traditional to offer the\nbenefit of one's experience to the boys and\ngirls that have just joined the Imperial family. I must be getting very, very old - most of this\nbunch look like they should be doing GCSEs.\nThe usual advice applies: always refer to gentlemen in red police cars as 'Sir', regardless of\nyour political sympathies. Secondly, an important detail was omitted from this year's Freshers' Handbook. Long ago, Imperial\nCollege managed to secure an opt-out from\nthe international treaty governing the provision\nof wild sexual abandon during fresher s' weeks.\nThe opt-out, unlike so many, has not been\nnegotiated away, so it's Ovaltine and a good\nbook, chaps. The final tip that I have offered in\nthe past has been to drink the exquisite beer in\nSouthside Bar, avoiding Union bitter at all costs\n(though not the Union per se, before some\nI/ OO Z3\n00\n7s ID\nOn\nr tZ J hack gets out of his/her pram). Judging from\nthe huge numbers in Southside and the ludicrously restrictive licence that the Union now\nhas, this may well be a case of preaching to the\nconverted. Union staff may think this is a 'huge\nimprovement', but the general feeling in\nCollege already is that we now have a licence\nthat is impractical, inadequate and so full of\ntraps that even the best stewarding the world\nhas ever known will not prevent endless\nbreaches, with obvious consequences.\nIt has been suggested by the gaffe r that I, for the benefit of our fresher s and middle man-a gers, explain the purpose of this column and\nthis college. My role is to keep you, informed\nabout the burning issues in IC and beyond.\nSinging the praises of this august institution\nand taking to task those who slip up. As you\nwill see, the latter is not a terribly rare event. In\na nutshell, Imperial consists of academic\ndepartments, which, for the most part, perform world-class research. The Sherfield building is the centre of administration that enables\nall the departments to function properly,\nassisting in their day to day running. If you\nbelieve that, you'll believe anything. It is to\nadministration what Benny Hill was to feminism. But for all that, we gentlemen of the\nPress love it. They make our job so easy.\nEver felt something could be done better?\nWhat did you do about it?\nNothing? Moan? Complain? Or did you do something to get it done better?\nIf you actually did something, you could be the kind of person we're looking\nfor. The kind of person who doesn't just study, but also gets involved in things\n- organises events, leads a team or society, shakes up the students' union, or\ndoes completely off the wall stuff - and really makes a difference.\nWe're Procter & Gamble. We make, market and sell over 300 world-famous\nbrands including Hugo Boss, Pringles, Pantene, Ariel and Oil of Ulay. If they\nwere businesses in their own right, each would be worth millions of pounds.\nAnd their success depends on one thing: the quality of our people. P&G people have certain characteristics. Thinking skills. Creativity. A way of setting\npriorities so everything happens. The ability to work with others. And, most\nimportantly, they recognise ways to improve things, then make those\nimprovements real.\nWe look for exactly these characteristics in our graduate recruits. We don't expect you to know all about business - we offer some of the best training\nin the world - but you need to have done things that prove your potential.\nThat's because we give immediate responsibility. You won't be making coffee\nor just churning charts. You'll get an active role, and the chance to influence\nthings - even revolution is e them, if your plans are convincing enough.\nIn return, we offer an attractive salary, an exciting work environment and\ntraining that will make you sought after by businesses everywhere. It's not for\nnothing that we're consistently voted one of the most admired companies in\nthe world, and one of best places to start a career.\nWe need people in Marketing, Sales, Finance, Research and Development,\nInformation Technology, Market Research, Product Supply and Human\nResources. The best way to join is through our Christmas courses or, for\npenultimate year students, summer internships. We only recruit at graduate\nlevel, so it's now or never. And deadlines are looming.

    "content": "LETTERS AND NOTICES 10 October 1997\nThe\nThis year we welcome not\nonly the students of the South\nKensington, St Mary's and Royal\nBrompton campuses, but also\nthose of the recently merged\nmedical schools to the Haldane\nCollection.\nThe Haldane Collection is the\nfun part of Central Library! It was\noriginally set up by the Student\nUnion and is a recreational library\noffering a wide range of\nHumanities and other extra-curricular reading and listening matter to\nall College members. Situated on\nlevel I of Central Library, in an\ninformal setting overlooking the\nlawn, it is open to all holders of\nImperial College and Science\nMuseum Libraries readers tickets,\nand most of the stock is for loan.\nIf it had not occurred to you\nthat Imperial would have such a library, you will be pleased to know\nthat it is by far the most wide-rang-ing of similar libraries provided in\nother specialised universities in the\nUK, so you made the right choice!\nThere is something for everyone\namong the Haldane's stock of over\n40,000 items - books, periodicals\nand magazines, music scores,\nsound recordings, language courses and maps. You can relax with\nlain Banks or Jane Austen, learn\nFinnish or improve your English,\nplan your trip to Ecuador, find a recipe for beetroot puree, dig out\nquotations to illustrate a speech,\nor read the latest of Lord Gnome's editorials.\nCritical stimulation is of course\nalso part of the Haldane's remit.\nSubjects in which it is particularly\nstrong are to a large extent those in\nwhich Humanities Programme\ncourse material is provided - such\nas art, history, literature, music,\nphilosophy and politics.\nA good selection of periodicals\nand magazines are on offer, ranging from Amateur Photographer to\nThe New York Review of Books,\nsome of them financed by the\nUnion. Daily newspapers are held\nfor one week. Most of these are\nnow accessible on the internet too,\nand there is a variety of means of\nconsulting back issues, from CDROM to other libraries, on which\nthe staff can advise.\nOne of the strengths of the\nHaldane Collection is the music\nlibrary. Performers will find a good\nselection of printed music, including chamber music parts. Listeners\nare well provided for by the classical CD and cassette collection, and\nthe popular music recordings col-lect ion, mostly rock CDs and cas-set tes, of which more below.\nThe Union still has some input\ninto the collection and your interaction is welcome! Most of the fiction purchased is financed by the\nUnion and, when possible, selected by a student buyer. The popular\nrecordings are selected entirely by\na student buyer, and the strength\nof this collection really relies on\nstudent input. Your suggestions\ncan be made on the regular library\nrecommendation form, and the\nlibrary staff will gladly forward\nthem to the student buyer.\nIn case you were wondering\nwhy \"Haldane\" Collection, the\nlibrary's honoree is R.B. Haldane\n(Viscount Haldane of Cloan, 1856-1928). Haldane played a large role\nin the merger of Imperial's constituent colleges in 1907, but more\nimportant from the library viewpoint is the fact that he was a widely educated phil sop her, edu-cation a list and statesman, who\nexemplified the value of all-round\neducation. Another influence from\nthe past is H.G. Wells, a former student of the Royal College of\nScience, who is said in a later visit\nto have prodded students into setting up the literary collection on\nwhich the Haldane is based to\nshow that they were \"not barbarians\". The library holds a collection\nof early editions of his works, some\nof which are exhibited from time to\ntime.\nFinally the Haldane is a centre\nof live culture. Watch for\nannouncements of future talks and\nreadings! In the meantime we look\nforward to seeing you and welcome your suggestions for addition to the collection.\nJanet Smith, Library\nImperial Fringe Theatre Company\n- Three workshops planned this term on voice & movement (20 October),\ncharacter (17 November) and creativity (15 December)\n- Alternative theatre productions incorporating innovative use of space, sound,\nmovement ('In throught the Out Door' a trilogy of Satre, Pinter & Keefe: proposed for January, auditions 14 October, contact Caroline Baillie)\n- Directing using psychological exploration of character\n- Workshopping and producing the works of new playwrights\n- Theatre in education - recipient of Millenium Award to tour local schools\nwith a new play about science\nTo find out more, contact Caroline Bailie at c. baillie@ic.ac.uk or tei 46804.\nImperial Fringe is an IC staff organisation.\nUnion Council\nAll Welcome\nCome along and have your say about how your\nUnion is run.\n14 October, 6pm, Union Dining Hall (Beit Building)\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\nHAIR CUT\n\u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX\nINCLUDES: CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your style, try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\nSHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp\nmassage.\nJr> PRECISION HAIRCUT by fully qualified hair stylist,\nexperienced in modern hairdressing.\n\u00abV USE OF HAIR DRIER with complementary gel or\nmousse to finish your style.\nOPEN 9-00AM6.00 PM Last Appointment for Hair Cut 6.00pm Phone for information on other special otters, e.g. Perms.

From the beginning this game\noozes quality, and as the jaw-drop-ping intra roles well past 2 minutes\nyou realise that this game is special.\nSoul Blade is a perfect arcade\nconversion, made possible since\nSoul Blade uses Namco's System\n11 specifications which are fully\ncompatible with the PlayStation's hardware. The outcome is an\nincredibly responsive game, the\ncharacters move like lightning and\nrespond to your every whim! The\nspeed is even more s uprising when\neach character in each combat\nscene can take up almost half the\nscreen. Taking into account the 3D environment it becomes even\nmore mind boggling.\nAfter playing Soul Blade,\nNamco's Tekken series seems slow\nand sluggish, much like your first\nboring lecture. Despite the limited\nnumber of characters in Soul Blade\nlearning those important moves\nand combinations takes time, but\nthere is a practice mode which\nallows you to configure your opponent to do certain moves.\nThere are six different game\nmodes to keep you interested but\nthe most notable is Soul Blade's story book mode. You take control\nof a character and travel around\nthe globe on an adventure, in order\nto find this special sword that has\nsome importance with each char-act er. This part of the game allows\nnew weapons to be collected\nwhich can then be used in the normal arcade and battle modes.\nFast, flashy and enjoyable\nsword combat at its best. H Magpie\nWIPEOUT\nPsygnosis mmM any of you out there may\nhave just bought a Sony\nPlaystation, and Sony's price reduction earlier this year\ncould have been the main reason.\nWhen the Playstation first came\nout the only game to own was\nWipeout - probably most successful launch game ever. Wipeout is a racing game with a difference: anti\ngrav vehicles and weapon pick-ups\nadds a new dimension. There are\ntwo reasons to buy Wipeout: firstly\nit's re-release has brought the cost\ndown to \u00a320 (quite frankly that's a bargain for any console game) and\nsecondly it's damn cool.\nWipeout is the definitive mix of\ndance music and adrenaline inducing gameplay. Orbital and Chemical\nBrothers have contributed to\nWipeout, while it's main soundtrack was written and produced by\nCold Storage. Sony even deemed a Wipeout music compilation CD a worthwhile release.\nThe game is challenging, however - the six tracks need a lot of\npractice in order to reach high in\nthe rankings, and a further six\ntracks await experienced players. If\nyou enjoy racing games an analogue Negcon joystick will bring on\na whole new experience.

Letters to Felix...\nRETURN FIRE\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to your letter of\nlast week, do you not think that it\nis a per cu liar ly American disease to\nassume everybody in the world\nwishes to be like on self? Take, for\nexample, the ease with which your\nAmerican reader to informed us all\nthat, because our system of government is not exactly the same as\nhers, we were all mentally ill (two\nsubjects on which, 1 should add,\nshe appeared to display a ridiculous and insulting lack of under-standing).\ni would like to inform you\nAmerican reader that many people\nin this country are working very\nhard to stop it becoming at all like\nhers - not least in the area of gun\nlegislation, where the same freedoms she seems to hold so dear\nallow one murder to happen every\neight seconds in Washington D.C, Detroit and Chicago. That makes\nnearly 1 1,000 murders every day\n(the population of a small town), in\neach of these cities alone. Perhaps\nthe \"right to bear arms\" might have\nbeen more carefully thought out if\npeople had known that so many\nAmericans would turn on their fellow citizens in blood.\n1 do not mean to insult your\nAmerican reader personally - in\nassuming that we all wish to be like\nher, she is m early saying what\ncomes naturally. I think instead\nthat her country's education is\nprobably to blame for the insufferable arrogance of some of its citi-zen s. Yours faithfully,\nMatthew Rollin, ICSM\nPS. If the Queen is dec ended from\nGod, and yet every king born was\nthe sun of a whore, then presumably she is accusing the Almighty of\npimping? That ought to do down\nwell on the day of judgment.\nDear Felix,\nI have just read the letter from\nKelly Green. Is she for real? What\nan absolute load of garbage, or\nshould 1 say \"trash\". I don't think 1\nwould call her necessity to walk\naround with an armour y in her\nhandbag, freedom.\nAs for the rest of her com-ment s, she just seems to have a grudge against the English for\nsome reason. Why is it that\nAmericans flock to places like\nBuckingham Palace? 1 don't sup-pose, with comments like that, she\nhas ever been here herself. 1 don't suppose, however, that we would\nparticularly welcome her here.\nNigel Russell\nResearch Student\nMech Eng\nDear Felix\nAs a contributor to this fine\njournal, it is indeed gratifying to\nknow that we have a global readership (Felix 1092) Not only that, but\nwe have\nsome older fans as well.\nJudging from the fact that her son\nfound out that England has a King,\nKelly Green must be about 80 years\nold (though if her son really is 18,\nthen she may simply be young and\nvery, very stupid). This of course,\nexplains the advance dementia she\nappears to he suffering from.\nRarely have I seen such a spectacularly arrogant incorrect, in co her ent, jingoistic, nasty piece of\nun creative writing. Apart from\nthat, though, it's dreadful.\nGiven that dissecting these diseased ramblings is as easy as\nshooting fish in a barrel, it is difficult to know where to begin. As\nmany of you know, T am not exactly a wish y was hy liberal, but Ms Green's views on the right to bear\narms, misquoting the Second\nAmendment, is terrifying.The idea\nthat liberty stems from the right\nand ability to blow people's brains\nout is a curious one. If T lived in a country where I felt I needed an\nMl6 to protect myself, I would be\non the first plane out. The monarchy clearly gets this women dangerously excited. Her defamatory\ncomments on the Queen are too\npathetic to deserve comment. To\nsuggest that 'the whole country\nmust be filled with morons' is\npathetic, and sadly gives credence\nto the notion that Americans are\nentirely ignorant of the world\nbeyond their borders; this is not\nthe case- indeed one of my\nAmerican colleagues offered his\nprofound apologies for this\nwoman. The system of constitutional monarchy is, I believe, the\nmost prevalent form of government on the planet, so a UN resolution to bring them down by the\n'use of armed forces' is plainly\nstupid.\nShe rambles at great length\nabout freedom. A constitution\nguaranteeing your rights' is inter-e sting. Would this be like the constitution that segregated blacks in\nthe deep south until the late\n1960s? Simply because we do not\nhave a written constitution, which\nas the US has shown is open to\nmuch abuse, does not mean we\nhave no rights, and further exemplifies the breathtaking ignorance\nof this woman. The Freedom of\nInformation Act is also intriguing.\nWould this be like the one that kept\nfiles on John Lennon secret for 32\nyears? Such laws would, of course,\nprevent anti-democratic abuses of\npower by government officials. J Edgar Hoover? Oh dear.\n'The citizens of Great Britain\nhave potential.' Madam, we are\ntruly honoured. If it is your belief\nthat you an example of what the\nBritish should aspire to be, then the\n'mental illness' you attribute to us\nseems more applicable to explain\nthe case you have so spectacularly\nfailed to elucidate. '1 cannot understand how any sane rational person\ncould make a case for the\nMonarchy.' It is a shame that, as\nan American, you are deprived of\nall sense of irony. If you're sane,\nmay I continue to be a chicken.\nYours sincerely\nSimon Baker\nChem PG\nSome readers have expressed\ndoubt as to the authenticity of\nthe 'Kelly Green' letter. This is a bona fide correspondence, and is\navailable for inspection in the\nFelix office if you still don't believe me. Anyone who missed\nthe letter can read it in full along\nwith the rest of Felix on our web\npages; www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix/\nEd.\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\n\n"

    "content": "16 MUSIC 10 October 1997\nSTRANGELOVE Strangelove *\n3 0 AMP FUSE Saturday Night At The Atomic Speedway *\nPatrick Duff,\nobviously not too\npleased with his\nFelix review\nStrangelove' s eponymous ly titled album, has arrived at\nan apt time, with the whole\n\"new grave\" scene flourishing with\nthe likes of Radiohead, Mansun\nand Placebo leading the pack.\nSuperstar introduces the\nrecord, an attempted an the mic effort that never reaches the\nheights it is trying so hard to\nachieve, a trend throughout the\nwhole album. Yes, it is dramatic,\nyes it is emotional, but it lacks any\nsort of dynamism, and fails to capture the listener's attention. They\nmay have pretentious of becoming\na stadium rock band playing\nmajestic and awesome anthems,\nbut even praise from Ed O 'Brien of\nRadiohead cannot change the fact\nthat the quality of this album is akin\nto a hopelessly cheap imitation of\nSuede's mic-slapping energy mixed\nwith an attempt at Smiths-like\ndepressing prose. If you were\nthinking of getting this album on\nthe merits of its singles, don't, just\ntake a listen to anything from the\nSmiths back catalogue instead. Q Jason\nPunk pop is a curiously\ndiverse genre. It has produced some of the most\ninspiring, en erg ising songs of the\nlast two decades, and seems to\ncover everything from Teenage\nKicks to Girl from Mars. I would\neven argue for Jane Weidlin's Rush\nHour or Echo Beach by Martha and\nthe Muffins. The two bands everyone agrees on are The Buzzcocks\nand Husker Du, both\nFilled with a burning anger that\ncould only be expressed through\nchainsaw guitars and close harmony screaming. Sadly, these two\ngroups are responsible for a legion\nof trailer-trash bands recycling the\nsame old formula to produce an\ninsipid, washed-out facsimile of\nthe passion which drove them to\npick up their guitars in the first\nplace. To piss on the graves of your\nmusical heroes seems like a poor\nway to pay them tribute. To\nexhume their corpses and parade\nthem like trophies is downright\nrude.\nAnd so to 30 Amp Fuse.\nDespite having fifteen songs\ncrammed into forty minutes,\nsomeone forgot to tell them that\neven a two minute song needs\nideas. That's the whole point of\nthis music, to make a smash and\ngrab raid on the listeners heart and\nthen get the fuck outta Dodge. On\n/ Fall Down they're almost there,\nbut end up\nSeeming more peeved than\nfurious. And Stereogram, with it's bouncy Ash-a like chorus, would\ncertainly be great live but sounds\nso thin and weedy here that it\nblows away before you're really\nhooked. Many of the lyrical themes\nare equally tepid, from the mun-dani ty of Smallville (look, we know\nit's boring working in a gas station)\nto the unrequited love of someone\nwho clearly deserves nothing less\nthan rejection {For You). Even their\nrehearsal space gets it's own special ode on Blastin' Room, while\nrecent single Punk Virtuoso is no\nmore than adequate. So sod this,\ngo and buy Husker Du's Flip Your\nWig instead. H Norm\nSLEEPER Pleased To Meet You * * v2s'> y Louise looking\nvery \"pleased to\nmeet you\"\nS leeper has its own distinctive sound: quirky\nlyrics; which almost seem like random words\ntaken from the backs of cereal boxes and\n20th century prose; and Louise Wener's incredibly\nsexy coarse voice. Their first two albums Smart and\nThe It Girl followed this trait, and with their success of\nthese two albums Pleased to Meet You seems like an\nexperiment into different styles, pushing and emphasising the melody but in no way have they sold out and\ngone pop.\nThe track Miss You has a worrying ly almost country and western feel to it, while the following You Got\nMe has a solid indie sound, strong electric guitar and\ndrums. The beginning and end tracks on the compact\ndisc have that familiar Sleeper sound, (with Wener\nshouting the words out with full gusto) so at least it\nstarts well and finishes as it started.\nTo deny this slightly different sound is to deny a band the chance to evolve though I am glad evolution\nis a slow process. To review an album is to compare it\nto a band's previous work and, admittedly it is differ-ent. The only reason to buy Pleased to Meet You and\njustify parting with a precious fifteen pounds is to have\nenjoyed Sleeper's previous albums and to hear\nLouise's familiar voice. So in the end Pleased To Meet\nYou is nothing amazing, not enough to become a must\nbuy but it will please all Sleeper fans. H Magpie\nEAT STATIC\nScience of the Gods\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFor me, Eat Static will forever\nprovoke memories of a dark,\nsmoky room, filled with drapes,\ndead cheese plants and festering\ncups of tea. An appa ling copy of\nthe Abduction album on the half-buried, ramshackle old stereo with\nfive and a half speakers at random\nplaces in the room, but the beats\ncutting through despite. All the\nbetter because we were, well,\nfucked.\nAnd all this is, in a way, critical\nacclaim for the new album Science\nof the Gods. More of the same,\nthen? 1 suppose so, but that isn't really fair. Eat Static are one of\nthose bands who's releases form a continuing whole rather than individual project - only each release\njust keeps getting better and bet-ter. Highly recommended for\nthose distended late nights when\nyou don't want to think, you just\nwant to wallow around in puddles\nof bass and BE. CI Jeremy\n\n"

It was about\nhalf a metre in length but fortunately did not hit anyone or do any\nserious damage. The Estates division of Imperial cleared the debris\naway and cordoned off the area,\nputting a \"Beware Falling Masonry\"\nsign up on a post. Scaffolding was\nerected quickly, after the local\ncouncil was notified, to protect\npedestrians and the children that\nattend the nursery below. It consists of \"a full-height scaffold with\nan access level and netting.

Released on 20th October, this promises to sell very\nwell indeed considering the fact\nthat there is a new Bond movie in\na few months. However, what\nLouis Armstrong would have\nthought of Iggy Pop covering his\nthroaty number, We Have All The\nTime In The World, I don't know.\nThe Doors are making another\ncomeback...sort of. Set to be the\n'crowning jewel' of the Doors'\nback catalogue, the package will\ncontain four CDs most of which\nhave been previously unreleased.\nOne of the tracks, Orange County\nSuite, features Morrison on vocals\nand piano with new music recorded by the remaining Doors added\nto it. There is also a new video for\nBreak On Through which uses\nexcerpts from the band's last ever\nperformance on the Isle of Wight.\nIt is released on 27th October.\nThe Shirehorses are to release\none of the worst albums ever...lit-e rally!

This is not a problem, as lateness has\nalways been endemic in\nto the music industry, which is part\nof its appeal but also the main reason that it is such a pain in the arse.\nWe've also missed the support\nband Sukia which, a friend at the\nbar told me, was no bad thing.\nI don't know what to expect\ntonight. Will we be po going in one\nof those intense, crushed affairs\nwith short but energetic fourteen-year old girls competing with slightly strange, totally tuneless twenty-somethings wearing shirts but no\ndeodorant to pledge their devotion\nto their latest plastic Jesus?\nUnlikely. I can imagine the dance\nfloor spotted with moody techno-heads dressed in alien ways performing their odd rites in studious\ndenial of the existence and absurdity of those around them. But there\ndoesn't seem to be the required\ncritical mass of misanthropists with\nbilliard-referees' gloves and blue\npainted inner tubes on their heads.\nThe set starts, and we shove to\nthe front. The band immediately\ncommit the sin of playing several\nbrand new tracks in a row.\nNobody's dancing as the songs\nmerge together into a dreary ennui,\nwith supposedly post-modern but\nactually crap keyboard nagging at\nthe monotonic bass, the lyrics\nincomprehensible even to my\nFrench companion. A hairy knob in\nfront of me is preparing a steady\nstream of spl iff s, using his girlfriend\nas a makeshift rolling mat. The fact\nthat he was able to perform this\ndexterous operation in the middle\nof the gig speaks for itself.\nThere's a lull in the music, and\nthe keyboard player starts pumping\nout slow, ugly chords on a dismal\nold Wurlitzer rattle-box. Fourths;\nthe devil's chords. He's concentrating intently, focussing on the\nappa ling resonances. Laetitia starts\nto sing, the drums come in at\nspeed, and suddenly I begin to\nunderstand. The people are jumping now as the music climbs up and\nup, building into a throbbing\nsounds cape that absorbs the evil\nchords greedily. It's fast enough for\na good bounce, but you have to\njump high. The music is raucous\nand untidy but has ames me rising trance quality that has us sailing up\nand down in appreciation. After a time between ten minutes and\neighty years, the guitars drag the\nmusic into a climactic, decelerating\ncacophony. But emerging from the\nsea of noise is a new beat, a faster\nbeat, that seems to fit in with devastating accuracy, and the party\ncontinues. One by one, the elements of the music fall away to\nleave only the mighty Wurlitzer, still\npumping away. Only now it makes\nsense, and the melody of the\nchords is obvious, explained by the\nmassive voice of the music.\nWhen Stereolab finally decide\nto let us back onto the ground, I'm unable to keep still, my muscles\ntwitching to any kind of beat. I'm ridiculously high and, once again,\nsee clearly the reasons why I make\nthe unusual effort to travel and\nwade through mud, vomit and\nsweaty arse holes just to see half an\nhour of music. For all it's myriad\nfaults, live music is the biggest, the\nbest and the most. Live music is\nmusic.

House of\nAmerica manages to avoid these\ntraps and successfully reflects the\nharsh reality of being born into a town with no prospects and no way\nout.\nIt's based around the Lewis\nfamily - Sid, Boyo and Gwenny and\ntheir eccentric mother, Mam. They\nlive in a small wooden house in a part of South Wales that bears an\nuncanny resemblance to the\nsweeping plains of North America.\nThe father left them years earlier\nwhen he fled to America and so Sid\nand Gwenny dream of earning the\nmoney to join him. The impossibility of this is masked by inventive\nfantasies in which they imagine\nthemselves on the American frontier with the aid of drink and drugs.\nBoyo is more realistic, however,\nand sees his family self-destruct\naround him while he learns more\nabout the truth behind his father's departure.\nDepressing stuff indeed. But\nthis version of Edward Thomas'\nplay focuses on the imagination of\nthe children rather than the hopelessness of their lives and is more\nupbeat than you'd expect. At times\nI found myself looking at my watch\ndue to the slow plot development.\nHowever, the aspirations of the\nmain characters are contagious and\noverall this is a likeable film and an\nimpressive debut by the director.

Although Pakistan only\nbecame a country in the modern\nsense fifty years ago, its culture can\nbe traced back to 5000BC and\nbeyond. The earliest textile\nsample was found in the valley of the Indus, evidence\nthat the craftsmen mastered\ndyeing and weaving techniques long before other\ncivilisations in South Asia.\nThe exhibition covers the\nfour regions of modern\nPakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan,\nPunjab and North West\nFrontier.\nAs the crossroads at the heart\nof Asia, this region has had an\nunusually large number of outside\ninfluences which is reflected in the\nvariety of its textiles. Seasonal\nnomad is m as well as more permanent migrations from Iran,\nAfghanistan and Central Asia have\nresulted in a distinctive style rich in\nvibrant reds, luxurious embroidery\nand costly materials. What is particularly astonishing is that these\nclothes were and to some extent\nstill are worn as people go about\ntheir normal business.\nThe Punjab is the most prosperous province as is evident in the\ngarish colours and expensive materials such as silk, satin, gold- and\nsilver-wrapped thread. To this day\nLahore is at the heart of Pakistan's culture. This is in contrast to the\nwoolen clothes, black or dark in di go, decorated with coloured\nembroidery of the North West\nFrontier.\nA selection of accessories are\nalso on display: bags, hats, shoes\nand animal adornments. A pair of\ncarved wooden platform shoes\nfrom the beginning of this century\npredates high fashion from the\nnineties by eighty years.\nThese shoes served a more\npractical purpose though.\nThey were designed to\nkeep the wearer clear of\nthe dirt and not to fall off\nlike Baby Spice!\nThe overall impression 1\nleft with was that of a nation that enjoyed vibrant\ncolours and rich sensuous\nmaterials, not just for ceremonious occasions, but also in\nday-to-day life. In fact the opposite\nto our own minimalist, strictly utilitarian habits. It is sad that this heritage is increasingly threatened by a mass-produced, mass-marketed\nstyle coming from the West. 13\nEmma\nGraduate\nRecruitment\nOpportunities at\nJ.R Morgan for 1998\nJ.P.

Although several second and third year students\ndo have a place in halls, Ms Brown\nhas said 'All first year students have\nbeen given an Imperial College\nbed. Those who are not in the\nSouth Kensington halls have given\ntemporary places in Clayponds,\nWilson House, Montpelier hall and\nstudent flats.' Montpelier Hall was\ndue to be closed and sold this year\nas the building was in a sad state of\ndisrepair. The late refurbishment of\nSouthwell Hall has led to\nMontpelier being used again as a hall but it is not known how long it\nwill remain open. New bad spaces\nhave also been created by promoting single rooms to double and\ndouble to triple in some halls.\nAn official date has not been\ngiven to move these fresher s into\npermanent surroundings, as rooms\nare being handed out as they\nbecome free. Some people who\nhave been moved to remote halls\nas a temporary measure now do\nnot wish to move. It is more likely\nthat it is the hassle of packing and\nmoving that is deterring students\nrather than the quality of the\naccommodation. However, the\nwarden of Clayponds has informed\nus that '...the dozen or so fresher s who are here feel they have been\ndealt an unkind hand as Clayponds\nis mostly filled with postgraduates\nand not other first years. It is\nimportant that first years meet and\nsocial is e with others of their age\nand year when they arrive at\nUniversity.'\nThe reasons for this year's his\nintake is due mainly to the new\nfees prompted by the Dearing\nReport, a study of the state of higher education commissioned by the\nGovernment. The Labour Education\nSecretary, David Blunkett, has said\nthat an annual tuition fee of \u00a3 1,000\nwill be introduced and applies to all\nthose starting higher education in\n1998, causing the rush of student\napplying for admission in 1997. For\na full explanation of the Dearing\nReport and the Government's steps to abolish the maintenance\ngrant, see our feature on page 10\nof this issue.\nPlans are in place to expand\nexisting halls and build a new one,\nbut it does not seem likely that the\naccommodation problem will be\nsolved for some years to come. For\nthe present, the Student Accommodation Office is still coping with\nthe overcrowding, but it has the\npotential worsen rapidly if the gov-ern ment' s vision of 50,000 more\nstudents in higher education is\nrealised.\nPhyz\nNEWS FEATURE\n'Good times' here again\nSimon Wistow on viruses, exponential growth and other computer nas ties Welcome to Imperial, and welcome for many\nof you, to free Internet connection. You can\nspend as much time online as you want, set\nNetscape to check for email every 5 seconds\nand send messages like \"Coming to lunch?\" to\nyour friend sitting 2 computers down from you.\nFinally, welcome to mass, spam med, humour.\nAs sure as Imperial has ugly buildings a you\nwill get sent a 'humorous' email by either your\nnew friends or an old friend at a different\nUniversity.

The problem is that it so easy to forward them on to everyone in your address book\nand they will forward it on to their friends and so\non. Even assuming each person only has five\npeople in their address book, it spreads inc read i bly fast (see box).\nClearly very, very quickly an awful lot of people become involved. This principal was recently\nused by students who, on finding out that the\nBBC sports personality of the year awards were\naccepting votes by email, organised a scam urging everyone to vote for the outsider Justin\nFashanu (who the bookies were offering high\nodds on). Secure in the knowledge that the black,\ngay, brother of John Fashanu was in so many\noppressed minority groups that no-one would\ndare dispute it. The plan would work. In fact it\nworked too well; the BBC only found out when\ntheir email server crashed because it couldn't cope with the sudden influx of messages.\nA while back someone decided to demonstrate this by writing 'The Good Times' virus.\nComputer viruses are spread when people\ntransfer an infected file or disk from a 'diseased'\nmachine to a clean one on some sort of portable\nRound\nNew\npeople\ninvolved\nTotal\n1 5 5\n2 25 30\n3 125 155\n4 625 780\n5 3125 3905\n6 15625 19530\n7 78125 97655\n8 390625 488280\n9 1953125 2441405\n10 9765625 12207030\nTable indicating the massive potential growth rate of internet viruses\nmedia.

It is unclear as to\nwhether it was a joke, an experiment or, as\nsome people claim the result of someone\nbecoming pissed off with a chain email entitled\n'Good Times' that someone tried to stop by\nspreading a rumour that it had a virus attached\nto it. The basic (there are many variations) email\ngoes something like this;\n\"Beware, a new virus is being spread around the\nInternet contained within an email with the subject line 'Good Times'. Simply by reading this\nemail you will infect your machine\". The subject\nis often 'Good Times'.\nThe sudden growth spurt of the Internet and\nthe guaranteed influx of University fresher s every year ensures that the 'virus' has spread\nand spread. This is an em passion ed plea; if you\never get this email read it once out of curiosity\nthen delete it or, if you can't bear to throw anything away, never, ever send it on (although\neven the American Government, NASA and several well known Virus Detector manufacturers\nwere fooled). I'd ask you to send this article on\nto your friends but 1 can imagine it getting out of\nhand and my children starting college some time\nin the future and phoning home to say \"Daddy,\nDaddy, I just got an email today with your name\non it\".

    "content": "COLUMNS 10 October 1997\nM8 C^y^ It's conference season\n,\\SJL| again. Labour spent one\n| ( HL' week and plenty of money\npatting itself on the back\nfor its performance during the\nelection, and the Conservatives\nnow have their turn, except theirs\nwill probably be a more despondent affair. However it seems we\nare sadly not to get our full happy\nblast of Conservative propaganda\nas Labour are injecting stories\nand events into the press before\nand during the conference. First\ncame Tony Blair's trip to Russia\n(where he starred in a radio soap\nopera!). Next came Bill Gates'\npublicised jaunt to 10 Downing\nStreet where he will undoubtedly\npromise to spend s quill ions of\npounds on something very mod-ern. But the most worrying story\nis the complaints by the new\nLabour women MPs that the\ndinosaur Tories have been\nharassing them.\nConservative MPs have been\naccused of plenty of things in the\nrecent past, not least of which\nhas been incompetence in their\njobs. This is a very different thing\nfrom being accused of making\nsexist jibes. Real harassment is\nan appalling verbal assault that\nhas no place in any workplace or\ninstitution, and offenders can be\nseriously disciplined for it.\nTherefore such accusations must\nnot be taken lightly, janet\nAnderson MP (a senior Labour\nwhip) revealed that complaints\nhad been made against a number\nof Tories (curiously enough, she\nrevealed this on the first day of\nConservative party conference).\nWe are told in grave tones that\nMPs have been \"sniggering\" and\n\"heckling\" women during their\nmaiden speeches. She says that\nthe men \"should grow up\".\nI would suggest it is the\nwomen who need to do the\n\"growing up\". They have pressured the parliamentary authorities into reviewing videos and listening in on the microphone\nrecordings of the Commons in\ncase the Speaker didn't catch it.\nThey are only doing this to the\nConservative benches. Apart from\nthe Orwellian undertones of such\nactions, it is an abuse of their\nposition in government to\nobserve and record every utterance of the Opposition's Members. Tory MP Michael\nFabricant had to \"put up with\nTony Banks (the sports minister)\nblowing kisses to me across the\nchamber and Dennis Skinner\nchallenging me about my hair\". A Labour MP once said of Teresa\nGorman: \"she's got more hormones than a Christmas turkey\".\nAccusing a woman of being\n\"menopausal\" is in the same\nleague as accusing an ex public\nschoolboy of being \"a poof\" or\n\"inbred\", common terms of insult\nin our Parliament. John Major\nonce said John Smith had less\nchance of understanding the\neconomy than Donald Duck had\nof winning Mastermind.\nThe problem underlying this is\nthat the women who have made\nthe complaints (all are new to\nParliament) may have come from\na background where vicious personal insults are rare and the\npreserve of the school or office\nbully. The reaction to such comments (excepting those that are\nparticularly serious and dama g ing) should not be to withdraw\nand complain, but to bounce back\nand hit them just as hard. All\nministers will have learnt this the\nhard way (look to Margaret\nThatcher for inspiration there). In\nfact there were complaints that\nMiss Betty Boothroyd (the\nSpeaker) was giving female MPs\nan especially hard time. It\nseemed she had little sympathy\nfor those who chose to come into\nthis institution and \"have it e as i er\" than she did. She and others\nlike her saw a huge influx of people come in, often half their age,\nand when they didn't like what\nthey saw they complained. When\nsomeone enters politics they\nshould be wary of complaining\nabout others being nasty about\nthem. Some of these people will\nbe in government in the near\nfuture, exercising considerable\npower when others their age are\nfighting their way through the rat\nrace. Although real abuse is not\nacceptable, someone with the\npersonal clout to be in government should be able to cope with\noccasional sniggers and taunts.\n* \" 1\n/ Hamish Common c Westminster\nm Eye\nrr;</// IN \u2022 - v mI'4m v\" Starter Right then, subjects, now that you've\nstuffed your tiny little cupboards with the\nfinest fruit, ve g and meat London can\nprovide it's time to get c uh in'. Our first culinary adventure is\nSplodge. This is my and many other stu-dents' survival ration. It's easy to make,\ncheap and versatile and it's also healthy\nand balanced in a tasty sort of way.\nThe ingredients are:\n\u2022 Tomatoes - either a tin of peeled\nplum tomatoes from those places we\ndon't mention but have super and market in their names or about a pound of\nfresh tomatoes chopped into smallish\ncubes (around l cm3) which are far tastier and full of yummy vitamins.\n\u2022 1 onion (yellow or Spanish) - chop or\nslice it according to personal preference.\nPersonally I find chopped bits roughly\n4mmx4 mm are tops.\n\u2022 Garlic - a matter of some cont rover sy. I'd go for 2 cloves (NOT bulbs, confusion over this point might result in your\nhaving no friends at all). Crush and\nroughly chop them.\n\u2022 Various ve g basically chuck in whatever you've got: Carrots, courgette s, peppers, beans etc. Go for lots of colour\nand variety. Chop or slice.\n\u2022 Some meat (optional) -beef / lamb /\npork (minced or cut up braising stuff) or\nfor those really low budgets a tin of tuna\nchunks in soya oil which make for something differently interesting. Cut up bits\nof bacon also work well.\n\u2022 Salt &. pepper &. spices.\nThat's it for the boring preparation stuff\n(or \"prep\" in the ars y chef lingo) so now\nstraight into the fun bit.\nFirst, chuck the tomatoes in to a pan\nand put on a low heat with a fairly large\npinch of salt (to taste as the saying\ngoes). Then heat up some oil (olive oil is\nthe best and yes I know it's expensive\nbut frankly you don't use it up that\nquickly and it really is better) in a frying\npan over a half maximum heat. You want\nit to just start smoking before dumping\nthe onion in. Give it a good stir every\nnow and then so it doesn't burn. When\nthe onion starts colouring (yellow to light\nbrown) add the garlic and carry on frying\nfor a few more minutes. Put the mixture\nin with the tomatoes which should be\nbubbling gently by now.\nNow repeat the process with the\nvegetables but don't overload the pan\notherwise they'll boil instead of frying.\nThe aim is to get everything nicely\nbrowned so you get loads of lovely\ncaramel and no soot. Do the same thing\nwith the meat.\nAt some point, add the pepper and\nspices so they have a good fry as well.\nThat way you get all the aromatics and\nvolatile lovelies to come out and give\nyour food that s crummy taste we're all\nafter.\nOnce you've finished frying, pour a small glass of water into the pan and get\nit to boil a bit before pouring it into the\ntomato and general stuff mixture. That\nway you get all the good bits that have\nstuck onto the pan into your food and\nyou end up with a clean pan. Cunning,\neh?\nNow the beauty of this sophisticated\ndish is the if you use mixed herbs (ore-gan, basil, thyme etc) you get a basic\nbolognaise but if you use curry powder\nyou get a curry and if you use chill is you\nget a chilli con random stuff. Three\nmeals for the price of one. Finally, serve\nwith rice, pasta, spuds or whatever is\nappropriate.\nAntoine\nV \u2022\n\u2022 v \u2022\n,'v v "

Sadly, those in private\naccommodation are likely get an\neven worse deal - a study just out\nshows that average London rents\nhave doubled in just eight years,\nand even even expensive rotten\nbasements in Kilburn are hard to\ncome by.\nNATIONAL CURRY\nDAY\nIt's true - 10 October has joined\nthe ranks of spurious festival days.\nThe question is - can ICU curry bar\ncope? They sold 40kg of rice on\nMonday, 55 on Tuesday, 60 on\nWednesday...\nSmall Ads lE&O Rollerblades for sale. Bauer X90\nsize 9, little used. \u00a335.

The first part of the story\nerroneously claimed that ICU\nlacked a Deputy President for\nFinance and Services. In fact it\nhas one - Rob Clark - but it lacks\na Deputy President for Clubs and\nSocieties.\n\n"
