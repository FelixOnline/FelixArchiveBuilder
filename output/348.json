    "content": "Page 2 FELIX November 27th,1973 LETTERS Idealist\nDear Sir,\nWhat rubbish Mr. Veafl wrote last week, in\nstating that religion is a private matter. His u nci er standing of man\nseems rather shortsighted and naive, since\nit is very much an individual's religious beliefs\nwhich govern his behaviour in the society at\nlarge. His understanding\nof sociology is remarkably lacking for someone\nwith such firm ideas\nabout society. Religion\nhas always been a key\nfactor in social and national behaviour; he\nneeds only to look at the\nMiddle East or Ulster to\nsee how far reaching are\nthe effects of religious\nissues. No, Mr. Veall is\nwrong, religion is not\nprivate, quite the opp o site, it is the public expression of a person's beliefs.\nHowever, if Mr. Veall\nwas badly expressing\nhimself, and meant that\npersonal Views on matters of faith should not\nbe openly expressed,\nthen he is making a different point. He, with his\npolitical views, has the\nright to impose them, by\nforce if necessary on the\ncountry at large, while the person with a view of God is not to open\nhis mouth for fear of\nsomeone listening. The\nhypocrisy of it astounds\nme; the sooner Mr. Veall\nopen his eyes and stops\nbeing the idealist with\nsuch a bent view of\nhuman nature, the better\nfor him and us. Religion\nand politics will always\nget mixed as long as\npeople are people \u2014 Mr. Veall's attitude is non-sens ical. Yours sincerely,\nAlan Gyrap.\nSympathy\nSir,\nWith reference to\n\" Stan's\" letter to Felix\nabout Duty Officers and\nSouthside Bar. I was the\nduty Officer for Sunday,\n18th Nov., but had no instructions beforehand as\nto what I was supposed to\ndo, in spite of specific requests for some. I thought\nI had been told I was supposed to \"sign in\" somewhere but the girl at the\nbar (Southside) HAD NEVER HEARD OF DUTY OFFICERS \u2014 and certainly had not heard of\na book. I just sat around\nin the bar all evening\u2014\ngot very bored\u2014and went\nhome.\nBut the real point of the\nletter is this. If trouble\noccurs WHAT CAN A DUTY OFFICER REALLY DO? Perhaps I should\nhave taken my camera. I certainly would not have\ngot more involved. II C students cannot behave\nin a bar\u2014then the bars\nshould be closed!\u2014or a surcharge put on drinks to\npay for a professional\n\" bouncer\" or something.\nMembers of Council \u2014\n\u2014the Duty Officer\u2014spend\na large part of their time\nserving the Union \u2014 they should not have to be its\npolice force too. If a police force is needed it\nshould be employed. I understand\" Hell's Angels\" offer a competitive ser-vice. But seriously I think\nthe Union should be ashamed that it actually needs\nduty officers. Accepting\nthat at present it does, using Council Members is a misuse of the voluntary\ntime that they are prepared to give.\nPerhaps as an interim\nmeasure, for Southside at\nleast, the \" Tenants\" Association should organise the\nduty officer rota, if that\ndoesn't work, perhaps the\nbar should be reserved for\nresidents only\u2014with every\nperson buying drinks in\nthe evening having to sign\nin. At least that way identification of antisocial elements should be possible.\nAs is probably appa r ent, I feel the whole question of duty officers warrants a thorough review.\nIn the meantime Stan has\nmy fullest sympathies.\nJohn Porter,\nP.G. Affairs Officer.\nStrine\nSir,\n'I hear some of you se students has been knocking back the NECK OIL and YAWNING all over\nthe place. Well, many's the time I 've CRIED RUTH after a few too\nmany ICE COLD CAN S, but the Union SLASH HOUSE smells worse\nthan an ABB O' SAR MPIT.

And as for the\nBURKE who TH ROT TLED ONE on the floor it's enough to make a BASTARD CHUCK. I also hear you se sports is a bit short on\nSHEILA HS in your parts.\nWell take a tip from my\ngreat Grandfather Amos, you SAUSAGE GRAPPLERS, if you se ever feel\nlike jacking in STROP PING THE MULLIGAN and spearing the BEAR DED CLAM or tucking into\na nice fresh juicy FUR BURGER, just tell the\nTART you love her.\nDon't forget you se can WALK TALL in\nAUSSIE LAND, where\nthe SHEILA HS BANG like SHIT HOUSE DOORS IN A GALE.

I clearly say Iam not connected with any political\norganisation and you\npromptly decide I am a\" Maoist\"! Yours sincerely,\nKathleen Corcoran.\nInsane\nSir,\nAs a recent addition\nto the ranks of British\nStudents, I am becoming\nincreasingly alarmed by\nthe political attitudes\nadopted and propounded by the National Union\nof Students.\nMy introduction to\nthis organisation came\nduring the first week of\nmy university career,\nwhen an executive of this\norganisation gave a short\ntalk at a college ur tion meeting. This executive\nread a list of 'our' political policies, which we were instructed to support if and when required to do so. These policies leaned so far towards the extreme 'left\nwing' that I, personally,\ncould not agree with them. Nevertheless, how-ever, it seemed fair that\nthe N.U.S. should require me to support\nthem, provided that\nthese were the views\nheld by the majority of\nstudents. Thus my initial\nimpression of student\npolitical beliefs, gained\nentirely from the N.U.S. was that British Students\nwere extremely 'left\nwing'. Some time has gone\nby now, and several college presidential election campaigns have\npassed through which I have discovered that\nfew students even remotely possess the 'left\nwing' politics of the\nN.U.S.; indeed most regard these policies as\nthe Wild thoughts of a few insane executive\nmembers who have used\nthe students' name as a means to add weight to\ntheir own personal\nviews.\nAt this point I should\nstress that I am in no\nway attacking the N.U.S. as a student body. Its\ncontribution to student\naccommodation and general amenities has\nbeen enormous and continues to be so. The\nfacilities and rights now\nenjoyed by students are\nlargely due to the great\nwork put in by this body,\nwork few students do\nnot appreciate.\nMy complaint is levelled at the politically\nambitious executive of\nthe Union. If they wish to delve into international politics and air 'left\nwing' views, that is their\nright. If, however, they\nwish to delve into poli-tics, using us students\nas their powering force\neither let them be sure\nthat the views expressed\nin our name are our\nviews, or let them be\nsilent.\nNigel Foster\nArab Refugees\nAs a result of the war\nrecently fought in the\nMiddle East and the efforts of the Arab people\nto liberate their occupied\nlands, some 1 0 0 , 0 0 0\npeople have been left\nhomeless and destitute\non the West Bank of the\nSuez Canal. Their homes\nhave been destroyed and\nthey are now refugees\nwithout food, clothing\nand shelter. These\npeople need your support and your help. Anything you can give, particularly clothing and\nblankets, Will be gratefully received and put to\ngood use.\nA collection of whatever you wish to give\nwill be made in the\nJunior Common Room from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day from Monday,19 th November and will\ncontinue for the following two weeks.\nARAB STUDENTS SOCIETY.

He was acc om pani ed by two other\nguitarists who blended\nin very well. Tom's nostalgic cl as sics: 'The last thing on\nmy mind',' Ramblin' Boy', ' My lad's a wild flying dove' gave the\naudience a chance to\nsing with him. Also' Whose garden was this',\nhis elder daughter's song\n\u2022Jennifer's rabbit'. Humorous representations of\nserious situations: Talking Vietnam pot luck\nblues', and a credible\nversion of what happened at incredible\nWatergate.

Plain\nseriousness: description\nof events at N.Y. leading\nto a riot and indiscriminate killing by the\npolice. ' Clarissa Jones' was also included. These\nwere the variety of\nmoods interspersed with\nquick-witted remarks\nand stories finishing\nwith two encores.\nAfter a break of a week I have decided to\ninflict my column up cn you a gc' n. RATT/ Travel The article in Felix,\nNovember 13th about\nthe room at the top had\na number of factual er-r or s, mainly due to the\nfact that it was not fully\ncorrected before in ser tion. The main error concerned the travel fac ili ties. The National Union of Students' Travel Service operates from the\nroom and has done so\nfor some time. The bureau is manned (woman-ned actually) between\nthe hours of 10.30 and\n15.30. The NU STS oro-vi de the full range of\nservices: short trips\nwithin Britain to long\nhaul flights to Australia\nand everything in bet-we en.

Effectively, he\nfeels students should not\nrelax their questioning\ninvolvement regarding\nimportant controversial\nissues of the establish-ment: \" Don't quit giving\nthe devils hell\". Al though he has got off his\nsoap-box he has never\nstopped caring. Fame\nand success necessarily\non tours parts him bom his family \u2014 one aspect\nhe does regret. The Isle\nof Wight proved such a success for Tom that it\nseems he could have\nstrived to become a super star but with more\ndisadvantages.\nOne of his future ambitions is to script write a serious play. Singing\nand song writing are his\nwork, striving to do\n'more and better', and\nat home he enjoys strumming a guitar in the kit-chen, which, naturally,\nhas often been the\nsource of good material.\nHe stressed that he a iso likes listening to music, o us discounts offered to\nstudents by a large num ber of firms and organisations throughout Britain and the rest of the\nworld. Iam hoping to restock\nthe room with some up\nto date careers literature.\nFew people at present\nseem to book the room\nfor the more sober\nevents, meetings, talks,\netc.\nState of emergency\nDuring the present\nState of Emergency there\nis a strong possibility\nthat there may be power\ncuts, oil supply cuts, etc.\nIf you require information on the possibility of\npower cuts on any particular day then phone int.\n4 4 4 4 and listen to the\nrecorded message.\nInsurance\nI have recently been\nin touch with the college\nabout the policy that has\nbeen taken out on the\nstudents' behalf.

Although he does\nnot consider himself a 'poet' laughingly saying\nhe would not compare\nthe lyrics of his songs\nwith the writings of\nsomeone like Ezra\nPound, one cannot help\nadmiring his way of expressing strong attitudes\nand finer feelings. He is\nvery much a family man;\nwhen his second daughter realised that her\nmother and sister each\nhad song dedications,\nshe asked why she did\nnot have one \u2014 so he\nquickly obliged her! The\nfavourite of his own\ncompositions is still his\nfirst: 'The Marvellous Toy' recognised immediately as a winner by\nMil tO kun. This is the second\ntime I have met Torn\nPaxton (previously in\nWatford, May 1971)\nwith Dave Horowitz barefoot at the piano. It has\nbeen said and written\nbefore but I reaffirm that\nTom Paxton is Tom Paxton on or off stage.\nMy thanks are offered\nto:\nTom Paxton for granting\nme the interview;\nJohnnie Jones and Anne Matthews of ' Evolution' the promoters, for ar-range ment s; Management and Staff\nof the Rainbow Theatre\nfor kind cooperation.\n*Anyone left wondering\nwho Tom Paxton is\nshould sample his\ndouble LP.

The only socalled oppression is the\noppression of the' dirty,\nsick little mind s.Iam ing up a frozen stream\nwe reached our objective, Kinder Scout,\nwhich turned out to be\na plateau lacerated with\n6ft deep peat trenches\nand bog, and with few\nrecognisable features, so\nnavigation proved both\ndifficult and treacherous.\nSince the peat was still\nfrozen, it was safe to\nleap across the first few\nditches, but after so it\nbecame rather tedious,\nso we were glad to reach\nthe edge and settle down\nto Mars bar sandwiches.\nWe spent the afternoon walking down and along a ridge, back to\nthe van. This was easier\ngoing, although certain\nmembers of the party\nmanaged ' to penetrate\nthe bogs despite the\ncovering of ice. We then\nhad to kill time in Buxton by going into a cafe\nand watching our very\nown gourmet devour a plateful of p'e, beans\nand chips.\nBack at the hostel, we prepared the inevitable\nstew, somewhat overestimating the quantity\nof rice, so it was down\nto the pub for the evening and then back for\ncoffee and rice pudding! Sunday was cloudy,\ncold and damp ish but we were too stupid to let\nthat worry us, and so set\nout for the most exposed\nGrowth\nsick of having their obscene propaganda ram-med down my throat\n( O h!Owl). The majority\nof people here are decent normal students\n(Hubbub) who have no\ndesire to be confronted\nwith a horde of limp-wrist ed perverts ( Up roar) . . .\nThe Chairman: Conference \u2014 Slow clapping.\nMr. Honore (shout-ing): Communists \u2014\nThe Chairman: Con ference, come to order.\nHold on sir (To confer-en ce): you have been\ntalking about tolerance.\nPerhaps you could show\nsome to the speaker. You can show which way you\nfeel about the motion by\nvoting at the end. Silence.\nMr. Honore: Only on\nTuesday I was horrified\nto see the retiring President sexually assaulted\nby a drunken homosexual (sensation). If\nthey have nothing better\nto do than publicise\ntheir revolting habits\nthen I suggest they could\ndo with a short term in\nthe army. No, it's rot funny! (Yeeow).\nThe Chairman: Con ference, could you try to\nrestrain yourselves?\nSteering Comm'tte e, would you add on extra\ntime for that?\nspot in the area, while\nthe other party went for\na leisurely walk around\nLeek, or set off on the\nSouthward trail towards\nLeek. But it was plumbing of a different kind for\nus, as we wrapped up\nin the colours of Slough Town F.C., Bedford College, and Leeds R.L., and proceeded to inspect\nStockport's water supply\ndown in the Goyt Valley.\nWe arrived back at the\nrendezvous slightly too\nearly and so took refuge\nin a native's garage:\nhowever our rather boisterous physical exercises aroused the owner.\nWho kindly locked us\nout. Due to a misunderstanding we waited 15\nminutes longer than nec-ess ary, but all was forgiven when we'd thawed\nout an hour later.\nWe stopped for nosh\nat Leicester Forest and having exhausted the\nsongbook, arrived at\nSwiss Cottage by 9 . 3 0\np.m., where we were\nkindly supplied with\ncoffee in a Bedford Hall.\nThe next weekend is\nto Dartmoor and wii l again feature Pete Bog, ably supported by Mars Bars and Megalithic\nmonuments.\nPhil Craven,\nMe ch. Eng. 2\n(Publicity Officer)\nMr. Honore: I have\nbeen subjected to the\nsight of their worthless\nliterature out in the entrance hall. I have seen\ntheir Gay News. What a miserable publication to\nbe less gay. They have\nno aim but to carry us\ndown a sloping path and to wallow in the mire\nof depravity and unh app hess( Hooray). No doubt, I have wasted\nmore time than they de-serve. But Iam horrified\nand you should be hor-rif i ed. There is no reason\nwhy we should be forced\nto join the downhill drift\nto the dogs and to the\nLeft. We are not just\ndealing with Reds under\nthe bed but Reds in the\nbed. (Frenzy). It's gone\ntoo far. The status quo,\nindeed the whole moral\nfibre of society is at\nstake. This conference\nmust put its foot down\nand say a firm ' NO' to\nthese communist i. ed\ncreatures and their foul\nmotion. (Mountainous\nroar).\nTho ChoTrman: Thank\nyou, sir and madam.A k hough not minuted, at this point Mr. Honore\ngot down off the speak-er's platform, /vent\nacross to the side of the\nhall and passionately\nkissed his boyfriend.\n!

Action taken varied from sit-ins\nand occupations, to\ncatering and lecture boycotts and mock wed dings.\nStudents at the London School of Econom ics staged a mock\nwedding in which Rex\nOsborne dressed in a polo cap and a wedding dress \" married\" John Carr who wore military\nuniform. The students\nfollowed the wedding with a bridal procession\nand collected cash wedding gifts. The money is\nto be given to the Kingsway Day Centre which caters for people without\nhomes or Jobs. Stockwell College of Education also staged a mock\nwedding in the appropriately named \" Old Palace\nDining Hall\".

The\nleaflets were drawing attention to the fact that\nPrincess Anne's income\nmore than doubles on\nthe face until his blood\nliterally stained the\nstreet . . . \"\nThese reports, taken\nfrom a reliable Athens\nEnglish Language newspaper are indications of\nthe problems now faced\nby the military junta\nwhich seized power in\n1 9 6 7 . As student leaders\nin Athens point out, the\npresent demonstrations\ntake place against a background of increasing\nopposition to the junta\nthroughout the year; opposition in which students have played an important role.\nThe students' campaign moved early this\nyear over demands for\nfree elections in student\nunions, to end the Junta\nappointing its own agents as union officials.\nStudents demanded the\nrepeal of a decree that\nempowered the army to\ndraft student activists.\nThe campaign rapidly\nspread to all universities,\ninvolving students in\nmassive demonstrations\nand occupations. In\nAthens the lecture and exam boycott lasted\nthree months and demonstrations reached proportions of 4 0 , 0 0 0 . The response of the government was the systematic conscription of\nmilitants, the use of\npolice violence, of the\npara-military fascist or-marriage to \u00a335,000 a year, whereas a female\nstudent's grant drops\ndramatically on marriage\nto \u00a3295 a year. Queen\nMary College and Sal ford Technical College\nalso used the wedding to\nmake a point about students grants. At QM C students opened up their\nUnion and invited in\nlocal residents to watch the wedding on their\nunion's colour television.\nSalford Tech. students used the day to\ntake some children to\nBlackpool for the day.\nThe children had been\ngiven the day off school\nand whose mothers were working. Bradford students\nused the day to continue\ntheir community action\nprogramme. They are\nrenovating an adventure\nplayground and collected jumble for Old Age Pensioners.\nSeveral colleges dec i ded that they would use the umbrella title of\na\" work in\" to occupy their colleges.

Then, completely with\nthe run of play with l.C. forwards threatening to\nscore, one of the King's defenders put the best\nlob of the game over his own keeper, although\nl.C. would have put it in\nif the fullback had miss-ed. From then on l.C. played the ball about until half-time\u2014the worst\nthing that could have\nhappened, for in the second half l.C. stopped\nand Kings came back\ninto the game but pushing too far upfield l.C. had innumerable break-aways only to see the\nfinal pass go astray.\nFrom then on l.C. held\ntheir own and finished\ndeserved winners. Special mention must be\nmade of the defence\nwho have been completely sound throughout\nthis season.\nThe 2 nd XI after a rather surprising defeat\nby the 3 rd XI struck\ntheir usual form by\nbeating Kings II 3 \u2014 1\nBill Pike (2) and Colin Higham(1) scoring for\nl.C. A mention must also\nbe made about Mines, who try hard but always\nseem to lose, who were\non the receiving end of a6 \u2014 1 thrashing by l.C.4 th \u2014 but Iam assured\nthey played rubbish\n(quote from T.

Friday's all-night er,a Rugby\nmatch and the fact that\nit was aUL match were\nsuggested explanations.\nThose who dared the\ncold to race for UL over\nfive miles of light mud were somewhat few: Rob\nAll in son recorded a spectacular 2 8 m55( his\nbest ever at Parly Hill), and was5 th(!) scorer\nfor UL, Neil Boag was49 thin30 m57,an dJ.S. Kaliray, Steve Webb and Dave Jones were\n59th,63 rd and70 th res-pec t iv ely. Other runners\ndeclined the opportunity\nto risk loss of life, or\neven worse, by removing\ntheir track suits and in stead went for a jolly jog\nover Hampstead Heath.\nA visit to Greasy Joe' s Tea and Chess Men ag erie was followed by a fruitless search for ad hippy( as in fish-and-c hippy) and, though a pub was entered (looking\nfor food), no alcoholic\nbeverage was consumed till much later.\nDo not despair, noble\nFeelsick readers! Your\nliterary genius has once\nagain taken pen to paper\nto bring you a winks re\nport. After following our\nadventures last year, no\ndoubt you have all been\neagerly awaiting the first\ninstalment of this year's serial.\nAfter weeks of hard\ntraining and serious practice we challenged a team at Folkestone to a match. Praying that we'd have no breakdowns due\nto faulty water pumps\nwe set forth for the seaside on Sunday18 th. We practised our s quo p ping and potting and CROSS-COUNTRY\nIf only Dave had\nbrought his camera on\nWednesday, then Felix\nmight have been graced\nwith pictures of some\ndozen athletes manhandling one of those\nRC C minibuses. A certain flatness of battery\nhaving forced us to push\nthe van to get it going\nin Southside car park,\nits running out of petrol\nsome 5 0 0 yards later\ncame as rather a blow\nand much( actual)\nswearing and( meta-ph or ic) kicking of said\nvan resulted. Now, many\nother clubs would have\ngiven up at this point;\nnot so the Rapid Ramblers. With Steve (X co un try's version of Jackie Stewart) steering and nearly (Neil and Kaliray'\nwere flaking) everyone\nelse pushing and making noises like car engines\nwe soon arrived at a garage on the Brimpton\nRoad about a mile away.\n(The days of many of\nthe inhabitants of this\narea were considerably\ncheered by this spec-tac le.) Those who went to\nSt. Mary's by train were\nnot entirely free from inThe start\u2014note the large field\nWINKS\nwere soon confident that\nwe could produce our\nusual display (later,\nlater). The match was good and enjoyable but\nwhen we were seen to\nbe doing too well, tactics were employed and once again we were glorious in defeat, by 1 4 ^\npts. to 4 8 ^ . We celebrated with sandwiches and black coffee (no milk, no\nbeer, no heating \u2014 we'll not go there again in a hurry) and challenged\nthem to a game of darts.\nOur skill with the arrows\nwas evident right from\nthe start and they\nthrashed us.( Well, who can hope to win with\nHelen in the team?)\nKnowing that, once\nagain we had carried\nforth the name of Imperial College (what\ndoes that say on your\ntee shirt \u2014 Royal School of . . . Mines???) to the\nfar reaches of the earth,\nwe returned in splendour\nc idents: the smashing of\nRob's third bottle of\nhorse liniment in three\nweeks was achieved by\na well placed shot with\nthe Hon. Football from\nPete Johnson. The actual\nrace (a league race) took\nplace over the usual\nBushy Park course \u2014\nflat, long, fast and tir-ing. Despite this, and having to push vans\nabout, we finished three\nteams, the fourth one\nhaving succumbed to\nchemistry practical reports and the like. Rob\nAN in son( again) was our\nfirst back at 27th followed by Kaliray (37),\nNeil Boag (45), Paul\nClarke (50) and Phil\nMeyler (53). Alf was surprisingly 66th and others appearing were\nSteve Webb, Dave \"I want a mention in Felix\" Payne, Dave Howl brooke, Keith \" the next\nbit's too long\" Ahlers,\nand Rich Harrington.\nMaking up the third team\nwere Dave Jones, Mike Welford, Rob M addison, Pete Johnson and Pad Donnelly. Pad was making sure no-one got lost.\nIan Ellis had a cold\n(sniff).\nIn this race our first\nteam maintained its position of 6th in division 1,\nwhile our second and third teams moved from\n7th to 6th and from 14th to 12th in division 2.\nThe fourth team dropped\nfrom 19th to 2 1 st but is\nnot yet last (lots of unfit\nrunners required!).\nAfter a slight incident\nwith a Chinese RollsRoyce on the way back,\nour usual Wednesday night position in the\nUnion bar was safely res ume d. Originally by RP D, much hacked about by\nDJ,( sorry, not much of\nthe original left).\nto a well-earned orange\njuice in Southside Bar.\nAnd now, an advert:\nWe in the Wink sCi ub would welcome anyone\nwho would like a game\nor who would just like to\nwa'td h( kinky!). We play\non Thursdays at 8 p.m. above Southside bar so\nif you've nothing better\nto do. Why not come\nalong? See Bob's flash\njacket, Tony's tight\ntrousers, Helen's assets.\nYes, it's all happening in\nthe Winks Club.\nThe team: Bob Douglas, Sheelagh Crawley,\nHelen Isaac, Alex Trengove, Mike Ixer and Glyn Jones.\nEMERGENCY\nThe Chief Main te nance Officer has arranged that INFORMATION on the timing of any electricity power cuts (when\nknown), oil supply short-falls, and any other related items can be obtained by dialing 4 4 4 4\non the College Internal\nTelephone Network after\n10 a.m. daily. The scheme is to be brought\ninto action on 2 0 November, 1 9 7 3 and is to\ncontinue until further\nnotice. It is thought that\nit will provide the most\nsuitable method of members of the College being\nkept informed.\nA.L. Atkinson, I for A. J. Turner,\nActing Buildings Officer\nGUILDS SEVENS\n9th December\nYour support is needed for this event\nAll teams to Tim Bradbury by Dec 3\nThe start of the new season sees the fencing\nclub maintaining its un broken record of success. The first match was against Leyton F.C. who were defeated 7-2 despite putting out their\nLondon League side. The\nI.C. team consisted of\nthree members who helped in setting -up\nI.C.'s unbroken first team\nrecord last season,\nnamely Steve Thompson(3 wins), Julian Tyson\n(3 wins) and Lawrence\nBoyd(1 win). The team\nwas particularly pleased\nto see a number of new members supporting us\nduring the match. Everyone retired to Southside\nBar to round off a very\nenjoyable evening.\nThis demonstrates the\nsuccess of the Friday\nevening training session\n(in the gym!) introduced\nthis year both for advanced fencers and begin-ner s. On the same evening\nwe also had a men's second foil team match\naway against Ealing\nTechnical College 1st To mAb solo m and Richard Annett defeated\na more experienced side\n6-3. Richard did parti\ncula rly well to win all three of his fights in his first match for the college. The club has also had successes in individual\ncompetitions. Notably\nRoman Gomez, who was runner-up, out of an entry of about 6 0 , in the\nSandhurst Open Sabre\nTournament to the current World Professional\nSabre Champion. We are\nhopeful that the club will\nkeep up the standard of\nthis result during the\nrest of the year.\nOn the social side, the\nannual dinner this year\nis to be held on Thur s day, 6th December, and it is hoped that as many\npeople as possible will come.\nAs always new members, men and especially\nwomen are welcome \u2014\njust come along to the\ngym, Thursdays 1-3 and Fridays 7 \u2014 closing time\nSee you there.\nGOLFING\nFree Coaches & Free Beer\nMatch report for 2 1 st November\nOn Tuesday, shortly\nbefore Big Ben tolled\nmidnight, the society\nheld an 'extraordinary\ngeneral meeting' in order\nto plan the defeat of\nBarts Hospital, a hospital so steeped in golfing\ntraditions that even the\nbed-pans are fitted with\nall-weather grips. Our\ndetermination to win was absolute since the captain of this notorious\nteam was none other\nthan Jim Foster, known\nto the I.C. captain as\n' Big Brother'.\nThe problem of team\nselection was unusually\ntricky due to the peculiarities of the opp osi tion. Jules Dan( Hon. Sec.) said it all (ns\nusual!) when he pointed\nout that fielding our\nstrongest side including\nfamous names like Bill\nCaId er wood, Rich\nBrown, Give Pemberton\nor even our developing\nstar Rich Wad di love would not necessarily be\na good idea. After al! Barts had a reputation\nfor winning matches in\ndubious style. We had\nheard rumours that their\nteam used comments\nlike ' Did you know that\nyou demonstrate all the\nexterior symptoms of\ntertiary leukaemia?' or\n' You' ve got a bogey\nhanging out of your nose'\njust before their opponent's putt, not the sort\nof behaviour that endears them to the opposition. All this added up to\nthe team needing to be\nmade up of 'Iron Men'. With this decided obvious selections were\n' B.M.W.' Bev Smith and Jules Dan, men whose\n'talk' credentials were\nimpeccable (in Jules' case his golfing ability\nis totally eclipsed by this\nother talent). Many of\nour usual stars appeared\njaded on account of\ntheir previous exertions\nand were declared ' un fit' by society trainer\nNoel Williams. Thus the\nfinal line-up became \u2014\nNigel Foster (capt.),\nJules Dan, Adrian Evans,\nBev Smith and Mike Marks.\nIt was this planning\nthat laid the seeds for\nthe sweeping victory\nawaiting.\nThe first hurdle to\novercome was the lun-cheon, traditionally a Barts stronghold. Jules completely stole the\nshow by describing lucidly every one of the 11 5\nshots he took to get\nround the course on the\nprevious Wednesday. Whilst Jules was delivering his monologue,\nAdrian Evans slipped the\nopposition a few sardine\nsandwiches, Bev posed\nin front of his new B.M.W., and one of the\nopposition fell ill and went home.\nAfter this the match\nwas a formality, Jules\ntalked his way to a mighty 3 and1 victory.\nBev, playing well within himself halved; Mike Marks, silencing ' Big Brother' with some mam moth putts cruised home\na2 and1 victor, Nigel\nFoster, having heard\nrumours that he might\nnot be playing up to first\nteam standard, silenced\nhis critics with a6 and5 victory. Our only defeat was that of Adrian Evans who never really\nrecovered from his Yoga class of the previous\nnight. The margin of b is defeat escapes me.\nThus a victory was gained by 4-j1^, a victory for planning cool-headed ness, and Jules. "
