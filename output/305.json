    "content": "Page 2 FELIX Thursday, November 18, 1971\nMcLOOGE Expounds!\nTHE WHO One of the problems of\nwriting anything about a group as popular as the\nWho is that almost everything has been said about\nthem already. In between\nthe times that the group\nreleases something new,\nwriters will scurry around\nsearching for some facet\nof their music that has not\nbeen brought to light. It\nwould be nice to say that\neverything that the group\ndid when they appeared at\nthe Rainbow Theatre was\ncompletely new and to devote a whole paragraph to\nan ambitious new opera\nby Pete Townsend, per-hap s, or at least something\nthat hasn't yet been committed to record. Of\ncourse this was not the\ncase and probably never\nwill be. Few groups would\ndare open their show with\na song they first did seven\nyears ago, but the Who did\nwith \"I Can't Explain\" and\ngot away with it. Nothing\nthey did was younger than\nthe \"Who's Next\" album\nand I loved it.\nThe Rainbow Theatre,\nwhat used to be the Finsbury Park Astoria, is London's newest and most\nambitious rock venue. It\nhas been heralded as the\nBritish successor to the\nnow defunct Fillmore\nTheatres in the States, and\nis the brainchild of John\nMorris, who was partly responsible for the (mis)\nmanagement of the Woodstock Festival and the Fillmores.\nThe resident light show, Joe's Lights, has moved to\nEngland after working at\nFillmore East in New\nYork. The theatre is certainly ideal for presenting\ngroups, holding 3,000\npeople, and a lot has been\nspent on alterations, such\nas raising the stage, to enhance the audiences enjoy-ment. The view from even\nthe cheapest seats is perfect and uninterrupted, unlike the Albert Hall where\nfrom some seats you can't see a thing. I hope that the\nspiralling prices of top\ngroups do not cause the\nsame fate to befall the\nRainbow as happened to\nthe Fillmores. The only\ncriticism to come to light\nso far is that the beer prices are astronomical, but\nthen you can't have every-thing.\nWhat better way to open\nthe Rainbow could there\nbe than with the Who? The\ngroup played there with\nQuiver on November 4th,5 th and 6th, and all 9,000\ntickets for the three concerts had sold out within\nfive hours.\nAccording to reliable\nsources (the group them-selves) the Thursday night\nconcert was not particularly successful, but on Friday the Who went down a storm. Whether they told\nSaturday's audience the\nsame as they told us is a matter of conjecture.\nQuiver opened the show\nalthough they were preceded by a bevy of can-can\ndancing girls who received\nwarm applause as well as\nmany cries of \"Get em'\noff\". The group had improved greatly since I last\nsaw them and now have a flawless P.A. system. The\nsound is quite country influenced and similarities to\nthe Grateful Dead are un-mistake able, particularly\nduring the fluent periods\nof jamming featuring the\nguitars of Tim Renwick\nand Cal Batchelor. The\ngroup did not get the reception they deserved but\nthis lack of appreciation,\nwas I suppose, predictable from an audience that\ncame to see The Who.\nThey took the stage in predictable fashion, joining\nthe can-can dancers, and\nstarted off at such a fantastic pace that it seemed\nimpossible that they could\nkeep it up for two hours.\n\"I Can't Explain\", \"Substi-tut e\", \"Sumertime Blues\",\n\"My Wife\", \"BabaO'Riley\",\n\"Bargain\", \"Behind Blue\nEyes\", a sizeable chunk\nfrom \"Tommy\", \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and\n\"My Generation\" followed\neach other in rapid succes-sion: It seems incredible\nthat Townsend's opera,\nplayed continually for two\nyears, could still bring\nsuch an ecstatic reaction\nfrom the audience, unless\nevery one of them, like me,\nhad not seen the group be-fore.\nAs \"My Generation\"\ndrew to a close a screen\nwent up behind the group\nand blinding spotlights\nshone on the audience\u2014\ntheir generation I had\nnever thought of the group\nbefore as an environmental one like say, Pink\nFloyd, but their light show,\nworking in conjunction\nwith Joe's Lights, was\nbeautifully sympathetic to\nthe music. And if you\nthought that Keith Moon\non drums was just a showman and a jester, I can\nnow announce that he'll\nwipe the floor with your\nGinger Bakers and your\nCarl Palmers any day.\nEveryone knows how good\nPete Townsend is as a guitarist so I need n't mention that; he was however\nwearing a silver boiler suit\nand did not smash his gui-tar. There's some news for\nyou!\nAs a conclusion I shall\nsay that the Who are definitely the best live band in\nthe world but something\nnew would have been ap-pre cia ted, otherwise journalists will be losing their\njobs.\nDo you want to read books\nby:-Ernest Hemingway\nJames y^l d ridge Marghanita l_ask i Alan Qrury\nMargery ^ll ingham Vladimir Nabokov\nGeorge gli ot Get them from the\nHaldane Library\nLevel 2, Library Block\nOpen Mon. to Fri., 10 \u2014 5.30\nPresuming that the rest\nof this paper is crammed\nwith news, views and\nevents associated with the\nGovernment's Green Paper\n(AND SO IT SHOULD BE!)\nwhat else has been going\non?\nDiversification \u2014 Your 5\nreps at the Board of Studies meeting presented the\npaper \"Review\" of First\nDegree Courses at l.C. Unfortunately the chairman (i.e. the Rector)\nseemed to want to settle\nthe matter before any discussion took place. \"I think we can agree that\nthe Academic Director\nneeds to be appointed as\nsoon as possible, however\nI feel that the former recommendation passed (to\napprove I.C.U. policy in\ndiversification as college\npolicy) is a matter that\ncan't be rushed and needs\na lot of thinking about\"\u2014\nthus despite a general\ncomplete agreement endorsement of the \"spirit\nand principles\" of our submission and repeated\nUnion please for a dec i sion, the Rector managed\nto finish the discussion off:\n\"I think we can use the\nminutes of the meeting as\na true record of our feel-in gs\". Thus it's back to the\nold slog of trying to convince some departments in\nthe college that not every\none of their students wants\nto be a super specialist.\nDiscipline \u2014 approximately four years ago the\ncollege and union got together to start working out\nDrring Drring, Drring\nDrring,\n\"Good morning, Union\nOffice\"\u2014\nArmitage answered the\nphone.\n\"Oh!\" he ejaculated.\n\"Perhaps you had better\nspeak to someone higher\nup.\"\n\"Dave, would you like to\nspeak to someone on the\nphone?\"\n\"No\" replied the weary\nNUS card s tamper. \"Some-one from the Granada TV\"\nArmitage added. \"Certain-ly!\" the now not so recalcitrant secretary shouted as\nshe leapt for the phone.\nPerhaps that isn't exactly the way things happen\nwhen Granada Television\ndecided that IC had been\ntoo long off the screen but\nit is characteristic of the\nway things have develop-ed.\nLast Thursday 4th November IC Union Office was\nthronged with IQ's of\n180+ (MENSA watch out)\na suitable college code of\ndiscipline. On the morning\nthe green paper was published the Rector and I finally agreed on the last\ndraft. Thus now the Rector\nhas to submit it to the\nStudies and Board of\nBoard of Governors for approval and I have to submit it to Union Council and\naU.G. M.I believe it's a fair document but it's also\na very important one\u2014thus\ncome to the U. G.M.(18 th November, Great Hall 1.00\np.m.) and sc rut in is e it\nclosely (copies should be\navailable in the Union\nO.S.S.( Organisation for\nOffice beforehand).\nCommunity Action \u2014\nSocial Service) and Community Action have got together within IC and by the\ntime you have read this,\nwe will have presented to\nUnion Council a draft of\ntheir new constitution for\napproval. They will become a major sub-commit-tee of the Union (like External Affairs, Rag Committee) and receive finance direct from the Union. This merger fulfils 3\naims (1) To give Community Action its rightful important place within the\nUnion; (2) to place it on\na more reliable financial\nfooting; (3) to bring together the somewhat politically oriented Community Action people (who\nbasically believe the cause\nof the ailment should be\nremoved (eg bad landlords etc.) and purely Soc\ni al Service people (who\nkeep to the ailment itself.)\nall fighting for the privilege\nof making IC an even more\nunpopular place to come\nto. A quick run through 40\nUniversity Challenge questions left no doubt in our\nminds\u2014we ought to withdraw immediately! But wily\nDave (pinball) Amos having a quick eye for an easy\nprofit said \"No\u2014we keep\nin 'cos the Union gets a hundred quid\".\nSo sometime in the future Simon Albault, Paul\nMcCartney, Z. Kronberge,\nM. Corney, P. Wardle get\na free trip to Manchester,\nthe home of Granada Television. It is not all hard\nwork either, the whole\nteam, besides getting all\ntheir travel and ancillary\ncosts reimbursed, also get\na free booze-up and hotel\nfor the night.\nHope and pray you don't meet someone like New\nCollege, Oxford, in the first\nround, otherwise goodbye\nfame and fortune, IC.\nThe team at the moment\nA big membership drive\nwill probably start after\nChristmas and close liaison will be maintained with\nExternal and Academic Affairs and the Rag. If you\nare interested now, contact\nDamion Cummins (Union\nfloor rep c/o Union Office\nand Met P.G.) or Brian\nHarris (Geophysics P.G.). Vacation Training\u2014Following the meeting of this\ncommittee, it was decided\nthat a detailed analysis\nshould be done within\nCollege to see if the Vacation Training Office performs a function that is\nwanted (a lot of people get\njobs through Depts. or\ncan't work for 8 or so\nweeks or would rather take\nmanual better paid work).\nPay rates have risen well\nthis last year\u2014over 55 per\ncent of the jobs paid over\nthe Grant fare (and letters\nare being sent to all those\nwho didn't bother to point\nout this fact to them). A lot of the work done by the\nVac. Training Board is based on very important feedback\u2014so if you want Vac.\nTraining this Summer and\nhaven't handed back your\nEmployee's form, please\ndo so as soon as possible.\nAlso apply early for jobs\u2014\nthere are a lot now in the\noffice that if not filled soon\nmay be withdrawn. Remember\u2014if you think we\nare not doing our job or if\nyou've got any suggestions\u2014don't hesitate to\ncome into the Union Office\n\u2014the more the merrier.\nAND LET'S SMASH THIS\nGREEN PAPER!\ngoes into strict training, no\nsex. drink, or academic\nwork for the next fortnight.\nEach member of the team\nhas been chosen for his\nknowledge of a specific\nsubject and they are all\ntraining accordingly. One\nmember of the team is\nlocked in Queen's Tower,\nwhere he is studying are on au tics by dropping large\nlumps of masonry on passing students, another is\nliving in a Mooney kitchen observing flora and\nfauna while another is at\nMaria Assumpta watching\nstrange habits. The remainder of the team is\navidly watching the past\n230 programmes of University Challenge somewhere in an isolated TV\nstudio.\nWhat do we get out of\nit??\u2014\u00a3100 an appearance\n(i.e. \u00a3100 only) and free\ncoach to Manchester.\nDon't miss them when\nthey are on\u2014see them\ncrush Pamper Grassgroin!\nCHRISTMAS EDITION The next edition of FELIX will be the Super Bumper\nChristmas issue, complete with Free Gift.

I was told that the team was going through rigorous tsa in in g,i.e. watching the\nprog every Sunday, and because of this will probably he in Bedlam by the time. Informed sources say that the teams strongest point is Renaissance Architecture, and their weakest is a craVing for lustful things which they are banned from\n( i.e. sleep and work). \u2022\nYet \u00ab another Union Council Meeting was held-on'Monday evening. They must- have\nread the comments in FELICITY two issues back, as this meeting actually succeeded in ending before closing time..... by2 minutes!!!!! Here' s what happened j \u2014\n1) The new Discipline Document, laying down what should be done with you when\nyou' re all naughty little students ami commit atrocities against the Rector, or other equally popular action*, which has now been agreed between the Union\nand the College, was discussed. It only lays down how to deal with offenders, but not any rules or regulations. These include summary punishments ( i.e. on the spot), e.g. fines of up to \u00a3 1 0 , expulsions from various parts of the coll.ege( or all of it on second thoughts, no such luck), and bot ty \u2014smacking j but there is the right of appeal in all cases to the Discipline Committee, in which case the punishments are suspended pending appeal ( l should h \u00abpe so tool) This is apparently quite a breakthrough, being the first document of its kind for years.2) Thanks to the per sistance of Dam i an Camming*, and no thanks to Martin C* Black, Esq., who suffered severe diarrhoea of the vocal organs during the mot-ion, the I.C.U. Community Action Group (somebody believes in individual vocal\naction) was formed. Thi? will be open to all members of U.S.K., and although\nthe Chairman must come from l.C., the other positions can he filled from an yone in USK.\n3) The method of electing delegates to the N.U.S. conferences was agreed. The\ndelegates for the November conference will be elected during the summer terra,\nand those for the April conference in January. There will be no ex of fie io members, but for the April conference there should be 2 \" novices\", including one fresher. All delegates will have an equal say in haw the votes are cast, whether an observer or delegate, and votes will be split accordingly,4) Council gave Rag \u00a3 | 3 0 0 ( loam!!) to underwrite the cost of printing the rag\nmags - all30,000 of them.11 And it is reported that they will have to soil12,000 copies to break even! I Someone must he going soft..., at those prices, that means that it must be being printed in full colour, or in' black and white\nby one of Britain s finest printers, and also that there can he no advertising and if either of those is true, it shouldn't be. \u00a3 5 0 was also given( a no ther loan) to West London College for their bit of the proceedings, as apparently 'they have n't any money ? ! ? ! ? ! Let's hope that we see the money hack again. "

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, November 18, 1971\nALBUMS IN BROWN AND VELVET \"White Light-White Heat\"\nVelvet Underground (Re-release) MGM\nWhat is so good about this group? Groups that it is\ndefinitely \"in\" to like come and go. Led Zeppelin, The\nDoors Traffic, and even Soft Machine have been and\ngone from the elite. But some groups stay. The Band,\nGrateful Dead, Velvet Underground. In a recent review\nthis album was described as \"probably the greatest electric rock album ever made\". I listened, and half agreed.\nThen an angry letter was sent to the paper in which the\nreview appeared pointing out that the review of the\nalbum when it first came out dismissed it as repetitious\nand pretentious, and I half agreed again. Some of it is\nrepetitious, certainly. \"Here She Comes Now\" is a bad\ntrack, built on very limited musical ideas. But the other\ntracks are repetitive only when repetition increases an\neffect, and are never pretentious, unless songs about the\nsqualor of heroin-shooting can have any p retention s. The\nBeatles, The Byrds and Country Joe could extol the\nvirtues of LSD, the Stones sang about pills and what\ngroup worth its salt didn't mention cannabis in one context or another? Only the Velvet could sing lyrics like\n\"I'm searching for my mainline, I couldn't get it side-ways, just like Sister Ray said\".\n\"The Gift\" is a narrative of how a man posts himself\nto his girl because he can't afford the train fare; she\nand her friend can't open the parcel so her friend sticks\na blade right through it. It's like a horror film you've\nseen before and know it has a grisly ending, but each\ntime you see it again you hope everything will turn out\nright in the end. This track, \"Sister Ray\" and \"I Heard\nHer Call My Name\" which sounds through headphones\nlike having your teeth drilled, probably do qualify as the\nforemost \"horror rock\" songs ever made. Music for\nnightmares, bad trips, withdrawal symptoms. Horribly\ngood, certainly, but not the best. After all, The Who's \"Tommy\", Pink Floyd's \"Ummagumma\" and Soft\nMachine's \"Third\" were still to come. But we learn by\nour mistakes and that is what makes \"White Light/White\nHeat\" so important.\nFILMS: ' Private Road' and\nDays and Nights in the Forest\nBefore I start my reviews, I'd like to 'plug' a film that\nFilmsoc is showing on the 19th November: the film is\n'PRAISE MARX AND PASS THE AMMUNITION' which\nis described as a look at \"the business to end all business\u2014Revolution\". The film is directed by Maurice\nHatton with John Thaw as Dom, and is well-worth see-ing.\nBack to the film reviews proper. At last I managed\nto see 'PRIVATE ROAD' and I would strongly recommend that you should get to see it. It is like \"Bronco\nBullfrog' about young people in London but has moved\naway from the East End to a more middle class area. The\nfilm is about Peter Morissey (Bruce Robinson), an\naspiring, young writer and Ann Halpern (Susan Penhaligon) a middle class secretary, who meet; they try\nto get away from her family first by living together in a flat and then by going to the West Coast of Scotland\nto write his novel; they go back to London where his\nnovel is rejected and Ann discovers that she is pregnant and she retreats back to her parents where she\nhas an abortion. It might seem to someone who has\nnot seen the film to be a rather trite story, but behind\nthis is the director Barney Platts-Mills. Barney PlattsMills is a director who makes films about the young and\nundecided; Peter comes out of the film as being a very\nunsure person. At the end of the film he gives the impression that he will eventually marry Ann and become\npart of the 'gin cultured' middle class and his friend\nSteve, the non-conformist will continue to go his own\nway. It's very hard to talk about this film is isolation from\n'Bronco Bullfrog' as this film has so many common\nthemes with 'Bronco Bullfrog'. And I'd prefer to talk\nabout Barney Platts-Mills' films as a whole when I review 'Bronco Bullfrog' in February (or thereabouts).\nSatyajit Ray's film 'DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE FOREST' (Paris Pullman) was the first Indian film I 've ever\nseen and I didn't know what to expect. I half expected\na film with a very rigid structure like a Japanese film,\nbut what I found was a very easy going film, telling of\nfour men who go into the country from Calcutta for a week and what happens there, it's a kind of back to\nnature journey which has quite humorous consequences. Ray's technique produces a fairly even paced\nfilm which does drag a little but there is always something to attract your attention.\nIn the next edition of FELIX I 'll review some films for\nChristmas; including Frank Zappa's film '200 MOTELS'.\nAlso between now and 1st December sees the London\nFilm Festival and I shall take a look at Monte Hellman's 'Two-Line Blacktop' with James Taylor and Dennis\nWilson and Stuart Rosenberg's 'WUSA' with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Plus any other good films\nI manage to see.\nBOOK REVIEW:\n\"ALTERNATIVE LONDON\"\nThis is one (probably the) best guide book to London\nnow available. Straight types should not be troubled\nabout the book's lack of applicability to them, since it's not really so \"alternative\" as the name implies. It includes advice about the perennial accommodation,\ntenant and landlord, drugs, and of course sex, hang-ups,\nwith which you may or may not be familiar. Its availability on the street (from part-time pushers) when you\nmay be able to haggle for a reduction on 30p, or even\nin the famous high street bookshop which refuses to\nstock Oz, Private Eye or FELIX. Or make 15p per copy\nby selling it yourself.\n\"Galactic Zoo Dossier\" \u2014 Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come\u2014Polydor\nBrown is back! Arthur\nhas had a lot of trouble\nover the last three years\ngetting a group together,\nwith the various ex-mem-be rs of his groups, among\nthem members of such illustrious ensembles as\nAtomic Rooster and Emerson Lake and Palmer complaining that he was impossible to work with. The\ncurrent group has been together for nearly a year\nnow and with this album\nunder their belts look like\nstaying that way. The album should come as a delight to those who liked\nthe God of Hellfire back in\n1968. Similarities with the\noriginal Crazy World are\ninevitable, of course, the\npercussion keyboard style\nof Mike Harris being particularly like that of Vincent\nCrane.\nBnt don't think that this\ngroup is a copy, The Act\n(featuring among other\nthings Arthur being cr uci field) and most of the\nsongs have changed.

Or perhaps\nthe demented ravings of a man regarded by many as\nbeing completely insane.\nInsane? Perhaps, but\nBrown's must be the insanity of a Rasputin rather\nthan that of a Don Quixote.\nThe lyrics don't detract\nfrom the reputation a bit;\nthey're frequently hy s teri cal, occasionally poignant\nand often hilarious, particularly \"Brains\" and \"Night of the Pigs'. While\noccasionally good music\nis sacrificed to make way\nfor \"weird\", gimmicky\nnoises and effects, the\nsongs are in the main excellently constructed and\nthe instrumental contribution by the group as a whole is not just a backing\nfor Brown. Listen for\nAndy Dalby's guitar on\n\"Sunrise\" and Julian\nBrown's dipping, swelling\nsynthesizer on \"Simple\nMan\".\nApart from the aforesaid comparisons to the\nCrazy World, this band has\nno debts. Don't listen to it\nbecause Arthur Brown's name is on the cover \u2014\nlisten because Kingdom\nCome made it. But listen to\nit. Now excuse me while I bury a hatchet in my head.\nYahoing!\nFORGET-ME-NOT LANE\n\"Our whole lives are an extrapolation of our infancy\"\nobserves Frank in Peter Nicholls' semi-autobiographical\nnostalgic, time-leaping play 'Forget-Me-Not-Lane'\n(Apollo Theatre). This statement just about sums up\nthe play's message\u2014the child is the father of the man,\nno generation is really much different from its predecessor. Frank is the author-figure, and the bulk of the\nplay is a series of flashbacks into his past as he stands\naside and comments on the action. We see him tolerating his affably tyrannical father (\"Don't drink, don't smoke and don't put propositions at the end of sen-ten ces\") attempting to court his girl, and doing his bit\nin War-time concerts. He grows up and gradually moves\naway from his friends, his parents and, to avoid repeating his father's matrimonial mistake, eventually his wife,\nall the time wryly regretting lost love and opportunity.\nAll of which would be rather dour were it not for\nNicholl's superb comic talent. The play free-wheels in\nand out of it's six-door set, jumping backwards and\nforwards in time, laced with wild humour and gently\nfunny 'Joe Egg' type soli loquo y. Anton Rodgers plays\nthe chatty Frank with an easy charm, even advising\nthe audience on the location of the Theatre bars; while\nMichel Bates plays his Dad with just the right tension.\nTypical of the play's humour is Frank's explanation to\nthe audience \"For those of you smoking hash and\nwearing beads and your grandmother's curtains, us\ndoing our bit was not the same as you doing your\nthing\". It really is a very god play, though judging from\nthe number in the audience it may not run for much\nlonger.\nOn the other hand 'Showboat' (Adelphi Theate) will\nprobably run for years. This revival of the classic\nJerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein musical enjoys\nhuge and varied sets, sumptuous costumes, hordes of\nexcellent singers and dancers, very acceptable music\nand one or two very notable individual performances\nwith Derek Royle and Miguel Godreau particularly sticking in the mind as Captain Andy and the lead dancer\nrespectively.\nUnfortunately the show seems to lack almost all plot;\nwhat there is seems only to exist for song-hanging.\nPresumably this did not worry the original 1930's audi-en ces, but now, after the strong dramatic lines of\n'West Side Story', 'Oliver!' and 'Man of La Mancha',\nthe mixture is really too weak. The very middle-aged\naudience applauded rapturous ly throughout the show\n('so nice after all this modern stuff) but the matter\nis of little consequence. If any.\nBob Carter.\n\n"

But\nyou can't afford it, can you,\nnot with the extortionate\nbar prices (and we all\nknow where the profits go,\ndon't we folks?) and a grant which allows for \u00a31\npocket money per week.\nThen gentle reader perhaps it is time you started\nmaking your own booze.\nExpensive? Well, beer costs\nabout 3pa pint and wine\nabout 5pa bottle; draw\nyour own conclusions. Or\nperhaps the idea of making your own beer and\nwine is repugnant because\nit smacks of Women's Institutes. In fact recipes are\nregularly printed in such\ngroovy rags as IT and\nFrendz. It requires very\nlittle initial outlay\u2014you've\nprobably got most of the\nnecessary materials already\u2014and the enjoyment\nyou get at the end is surely\njustification for the time\nyou put into it.\nThe basic materials for\nwinemaking are as follows:\nA plastic or enamel bucket\nholding at least a gallon, a glass carboy or jar holding\na gallon (with a cork and\nair lock), a length of rubber\nor plastic tubing (about 3\nfeet), various pots and\npans, and of course bot-t les. As for ingredients,\nanything can be and is\nused, ranging from the no-risk tinned grape-juice\nwines with additions of citric acid, sulphur dioxide\ntablets, grape tannin and\nother chemicals, to concoctions consisting of leftover vegetables prepared\nin traditionally repulsive\nways such as being left to\ncollect a thick mould. It is\ntrue that quite palatable\nwines can still be made\nquite cheaply without resorting to anything doubt-ful.\nThese instructions are\nfor a fairly cheap wine with\nout chemical embellishment and without a mould.\nMethods of preparing the\nextract to be fermented, or\n\"must\" as it is called vary\nwith the individual recipes\nbut basically, for fruit and\nflower wines cut up or\nbreak 4 lb. of fruit or a gallon of flowers and pour\non a gallon of boiling wat-er. Leave for about 3 days\nthen strain and add 4 lbs.\nof sugar and a teaspoonful of yeast; for vegetables slice about 5 lb. and\nsimmer in a gallon of water until tender, replacing\nany water lost during the\nboiling, then strain, add 4\nlb. of sugar and, when the\nmust is cool, the yeast.\nYeast can be of any sort\u2014\nbrewer's or baker's yeast\nworks quite well although\na wine yeast is obviously\npreferable. The sweetened\nyeast ed juice is poured into the jar until it is filled.\nAny surplus is kept in a bottle for topping up the\nmain bulk during ferment a tion. The jar is stood on a tray in a warm room and\nsoon fermentation starts\nand froth pours over the\nsides of the container into\nthe tray. When froth no\nlonger forms, the tray is\nremoved, the jar cleaned\nand an air lock or loosely\nfitting cork is fitted. When\ngas bubbles are no longer\nformed, the wine is treated\nas follows depending on\nthe type of wine required.\nFor dry still wines place\nthe jar in a cool room for\nfourteen days and syphon\ndifficult to make except by\naccident.\nHowever carefully you\nthink you've made the\nwine, snags do occur. The\none which bothers me\nmost is that wine continues to ferment after it has\nbeen bottled even though\nit looked completely dead\nin the jar. There are several remedies for this; you\ncan bang the corks in, tie\nthem down and hope that\nit makes a good sparkling\nwine, or pour wine back in\nthe jar, let it ferment on\nand hope you won't be\nfooled again, or try ster il ising the bottles in boiling\nwater. I haven't tried this\nmyself but I am assured it\nworks. Many home-made\nwines won't clear and alA f ter one you do anything well A well known secretary showing the CONSOCQUENCES\nof Loadernberry wine.\noff, without disturbing the\nyeast deposit. The wine\ncan now either be bottled\nand left for 6 months before sampling or alternatively it can be stored in\nthe jar for 6 months and\nthen bottled for another\n6 months. The advantages\nof this method are that the\nwine is less likely to ferment in the bottle and\nmore likely to be clear\nwhen drunk. For dry sparkling wines bottle the wine\nin heavy glass (champ-agne) bottles, add a teaspoonful of sugar to each\nbottle before corking, and\ntie the corks down tightly.\nFor sweet, still wines, to\neach gallon of fermented\nwine add f lb of sugar, stir\nuntil dissolved, reinsert the\nair lock and allow to ferment once more. When\ngas is no longer formed\ntaste the wine and if it is\nnot sweet add another \u00a3\nlb. of sugar and re ferment. This should be repeated\nuntil the sugar remains un-fermented. This shows that\nthe yeast is dead and more\nsugar can be added if desired without the risk of\nfurther fermentation. Sweet\nsparkling wines are very\nthough this has no effect\non the taste, it does seem\nto detract from the aristocratic feeling some\npeople get when sipping\ntheir plo nk. It can be avoided by adding apec to ly tic enzyme (e.g. Pectozyme) to the must before\nfermentation, which should\nalso ensure that fermentation is over fairly quickly,\nor by adding wine fining s(e.g. CWS) after fermentation. More serious is\nwhen the wine picks up\nmould or vinegar bacteria.\nThis should be prevented\nby an efficient air lock but\nif it does happen you might\nas well throw the wine\naway. Then there is the\ncase when everything\nseems to be fine except\nthe wine doesn't taste\ngood. In that case you can\neither grin and bear it or\ntry turning it into vermouth\nby adding bitter herbs.\nWith a bit of luck none of\nthese horrors will befall\nyou and you will have a wine you will be proud to\nshow your friends, even if\nyou drink it all yourself. I should stress that wine\nmust take its own time and\nunless you buy a grape-extract-type wine this will\nbe at least nine months.\nThe making of beer will\nprobably be of more interest to students because it\nonly takes a month at the\nmost to make. The majority of home-made beer\ncomes from kits of various\nsorts complete with instructions so it doesn't seem necessary to repeat\nthem here. The equipment\nrequired is almost the\nsome as that for wine-mak-ing except that a larger\nbucket may be required\nand that screw-topped cider bottles are much better\nthan corked ones. The best\nof the kits is the one called \"Geordie\" which contains a string bag of malt\nand hops which is brewed\njust like the real thing,\nfolks, other kits miss out\nthe brewing part and supply malt extract which just\nneeds to be dissolved in\nwater.\nThere are a few points\nworth making which you\nprobably won't find in any\ninstructions. If you can't find a saucepan big enough to do the brewing in,\nrepeated dousing of the\nmalt and hops with boiling\nwater seems to work just\nas well. The beer tends to\nthrow down a heavy deposit which gets into the bottles when the beer is sy pone d off, this can be partially offset by syphoning\noff the beer twice \u2014\nonce about 3 days before\nadd again just before bot-t ling. There will still be\nsome sediment in the bottom of the bottles by the\ntime the beer is ready, so\nwhen opening them decant carefully into a jug\nbefore serving.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX Thursday, November 18, 1971\nTOUCHSTONE Weekends away from I.C. at which general topics of\ninterest are discussed\nThere are four Touchstone Weekends each year: two in the autumn term and\ntwo in the spring term. They were started in 1950 by Air-Chief Marshal Sir Roderick Hill as informal weekends with a set discussion al topic about the same time\nas General Studies were founded. Both were founded to help to restore the\nbalance between arts and science in an all-science college. I think that both\nTouchstone and General Studies are a very important part of this college and\nthey offer the chance for both Staff and students to climb out of their science-orientated shells and gain a broader outlook on life. Both are arranged by Mr.\nMcDowall, who lives behind a door labelled \"General Studies\" on level 3, College\nBlock.\nTouchstone weekend starts on Saturday after lunch when a coach leaves from\nthe Union Arch arriving at Silwood Park in time for afternoon tea. Accommodation is in dormitories in huts and is of varying degrees of comfort depending\nupon one's skill in choosing a bed. After tea everyone assembles in the senior\ncommon room in the main house. Mr. McDowall then explained the history and\naims of Touchstone, these being to give staff and students an opportunity to discuss various topics that will not necessarily concern them in their work. The\nguest speaker is then invited to sit on the \"Soap Box of Free Speech\" to give\nhis talk (he usually prefers to stay in his chair). The talk lasts about one hour, after\nwhich there is general questioning of the speaker and discussion until the bar\nopens for a pre-supper drink. After the evening meal three or four groups of\nabout eight people are formed and sets of questions are passed around which have\nbeen thought up to help discussion.\nBo's Sunday Morning\nJaunt\nFor the 15th year in s uc cession, Boanerges, the\nCity and Guilds veteran\ncar, successfully completed the London - Brighton veteran car Rally on\nSunday, November 7th, with 4 | hours to spare.\nThe maximum average\nspeed allowed is 20 m.p.h. and despite various stops\ndue to overheating (mainly\ncaused by the President's interest in the outstanding\nscenery) losing the President's hat (next to a beautiful girl, by chance) and\nstops for the President to\ncommunicate with nature\n(and the women along the\nroute) Bo managed to\naverage over 19 m.p.h., arriving in Brighton only 7\nminutes after the earliest\npermitted time.\nThis performance was\nlargely due to the many\nhours of hard work by Rob\nMathews (Bo driver) and\nthe other members of the\nMotor Club, who stripped\nand rebuilt the gearbox,\noverhauled the ignition\nsystem and carried out the\nmany other jobs required\nto bring Bo to his present\nexcellent running cond i tion. We are also indebted\nto the mechanical engineering workshop staff\n_ _ J 'Silwood Park as it was in 19^7'\nThe whole evening, with a break for a drink in the\nmiddle is spent discussing. Usually the groups split up\naround 11 o 'clock or midnight and people then disperse,\nmany to play snooker or darts.\nSunday morning is left completely free and most\npeople go for a walk in Windsor Great Park, reas sem ling in the \"Imperial Bar\" at the Cannon before lunch.\nAfter lunch everyone reassembles in the Senior Common where conclusions to each question are taken\nseparately and discussed, then the speaker sums up,\nbringing the weekend to a close.\nThe first Touchstone Weekend of the year took place\non 30th31 st October. The guest speaker was Sir\nRobert Birley, K.C.M.G., M.A., F.S.A., who talked about\n\"Nationalism Today\". I found the weekend was certainly the most stimulating Touchstone that I have been\nto.\nSir Robert started by defining nationalism, quoting\nfrom various sources and using the basic definition of\nnationalism as the feeling amongst a group of people\nof a unique common heritage and possessing a country.\nHaving set up this definition of nationalism he proceeded to talk about various cases of nationalism\nthroughout history, from 90 B.C. when Corfinium attempted to free itself from the ties of Rome, to the present day where he discussed Welsh, Scots, Quebecois,\nand African nationalism s amongst others. Sir Robert\nalso talked about the special problems of places like\nBengal and Ireland where certain minorities felt they\nwere being persecuted and said that it was his belief\nthat posterity would judge a nation by the way that it\ntreated its minorities.\nThe next Touchstone Weekend is on 4th5 th December on the topic:\u2014\"America and Asia \u2014 the clash of\ncultures\". This is the centenary Touchstone and so it\nwill be a very special one.\nUNION FINANCE\nIn most years about 85\nor 90 per cent of the\nUnion's income is derived\nfrom student fees, paid\nautomatically. This amount\nin 1970-71 was \u00a323,376.\nExpenditure was about\n\u00a327,000; but the balance\nwas met by income from\nlife members, the Union\nBookshop, investment in-te rest, etc.\nHow was the expenditure allocated? About 34%\nof it can be grouped under\nfour broad headings:\u2014\nGeneral Services and Administration\n16.7%\nNewspapers, duplicating\nand posters, repairs and\nminor replacements, in-sur ances, rent of TV's, secretarial help, sabbatical year payments, etc.\nNUS\n3.5%\nHalf of the annual subscription (the College\nalso contributed), student conference costs,\nlegal aid sub.\nPublications\n4.5%\n(Felix, Phoenix, and\ngrant to USK handbook).\nGrants to various Union\nand College organisations.\n9.4%\n(Academic Affairs, Welfare, and External Affairs Committee, Silwood Park Committee,\nICWA, Haldane Library,\nExploration Board, and\nNightline, and the Day\nNursery).\nThe remaining 66%\n(about \u00a317,600) was\nlargely spent on the student clubs and societies\n\u2014an area which receives\nparticular attention in the\nDES proposals. This money is channelled in\nthree ways: \u2014\nClubs Committees\n(\u00a311,300).\n42.4%\n(The Athletics, Recreational, and Social Clubs\nCommittees control 85\nstudent clubs and Societies).\nCapital Equipment\nExpenditure\n8.5%\nThe grant administered\nby the Union Finance\nCommittee which reports to Council. The\nstock of equipment and\nmotor vehicles is worth\nabout \u00a316,500 and the\n1970-71 grant (\u00a32,300)\nwas mainly used for replacement of worn-out\nitems.\nConstituent College\nUnions (\u00a34,000).\n15%\nThe C&G, RCS and RSM\nUnions control another\n40 student clubs and so-cie ties; and the major\npart of their expenditure\ngoes to these.\nVoluntary Subscriptions.\nMembership of most\nclubs and societies already\ninvolves payment of sub-script ions, and many of\nthese would have to be\nvery considerably increased if the Union\ngrants were terminated.\nSubs now range from the\nnominal (e.g.12 \u00a3p), to a level of 75p or \u00a31 for sports\nclubs. Boat Club members\npay \u00a32.50; and Gliding\nmembers \u00a310 (with very\nsubstantial launching fees\nand soaring fees as well).\nTravel and other costs are\nonly sub sidi sed to a limited extent. A number of\nclubs pay instructor's fees,\nand many are affiliated to\nnational organisations or\ncontrolling bodies.\nFinancial Control\nUnion Council, the main\nsub-committee, and the\nConstituent Colleges approve detailed estimates at\nthe start of each year. The\nUnion Treasurer and eight\nother Senior treasurers\n(members of staff) aid the\ncommittees in budget con-tro l. At the end of each\nfinancial year the accounts\nare professionally audited,\nand included in the College's annual report.\nUltra Vires payments.\nNormally at least 10% of\nincome is obtained from\nother sources than the\nL.E.A. fees, so it is not possible to say that any particular single item of expenditure is a direct\ncharge on the fees. Microscopic scrutiny by the\nComptroller General might\nidentify one or two payments which could be held\nto further political opinions\nthat are obviously not related to the general purposes of the Union; but\nthese would be very small\nindeed.\nIncreasing costs and the\nUnion subscription.\nInflation and the growth\nof Union activities have led\nto two increases in the rate\nof the Union subscription\nin the past 10 years. Each\nof these was carefully and\nresponsibly assessed by\njoint College/Union working groups; and accepted\nby the Governors. The fee\nwas raised to \u00a37 per student this year, as an interim measure: but it is\nagreed that it should go to\n\u00a310 in October 1972 if the\nUnion is to meet its general needs, provide adequate staffing for the\noffice, and fulfil its responsibility for the upkeep of\nfurniture and furnishings in\nthe various premises it\nuses.\nHitherto the College has\nbeen the Union'spay mast ter only in the sense that\nit has transmitted the appropriate sums from the\nL.E.A. fees, and has approved the annual accounts. The new proposals could change this by\nintroducing, for the first\ntime, a conflict between\nthe financial needs of the\nUnion and those of other\nclaimants on the College's overall resources.\nwithout whose help Bo\nwould have stopped working long ago.\nThis year's Brighton\nrun was one of the best in\nrecent years. Not only\nwas Bo sent off by 50-plus\npy jama clad Guildsmen\nboo malak a making wildly,\nbut there were over 70 at\nthe traditional Motor Club\nmeal to celebrate Bo's successful trip. However, we\nwant 100 next year, so\nwake up all of you sleeping\nGuildsmen and come\nalong. It's a great day out\nand even if you don't like\ncars there's an alcoholic\nchoir practice on the way\nback. (I can't think of any\nGuildsman who wouldn't like that\u2014Ed.).\nFor those who are inter-este d, Bo is a1902 James\nand Browne 9-h.p. Tonneau. Built in Hammersmith, it is the elder of the\ntwo remaining examples of\nthis marque. It has a horizontal twin-cylinder engine\nof 2.45 litres capacity\n(that's2.45x1027 cubic\nangstroms to you R.C.S. men or 4.32 pints if you're\nin Mines). With its alloy\ncrankcase and gearbox,\nstraight-cut gears, giving\n40 m.p.h. per 1,000 r.p.m. in top, and triple-choke\nprogressive carb, it's performance is not far short\nof (nerve) shattering.\nThe present Boanerges\nwas bought by the college\nin 1933 when the original\none, a Rover, was found to\nhave been built post-1904,\nnot in 1903 as was first\nthought, and hence was\ntoo young for the Brighton\nrun (though it had completed the run several\ntimes before V. C.C. discovered its correct age). The Rover had an\nignominious end when it\nwas pushed, minus its engine and gearbox, but\nwith an effigy of the\nPrime Minister sat at the\nsteering wheel, to No. 10\nDowning Street, and left\nto the country.\nIn more recent years,\nGuilds has had a Bo Belle.\nHowever, after last year's fiasco (supposedly the 1st Union Meeting of the year)\nwhen Bo Belle was ele c ted, it was decided not to\nsubject the ladies of\nGuilds to the ordeals of\nparading amidst jeers and\nwhistles, which tended to\nproduce rosy cheeks and\ndeflated egos.\nAs well as participating\nin the Brighton run, Bo\nalso takes part in many\nGuilds events, including\nCarnival collections, supporting the boat crews on\nMorphy Day (what was\nthat about driving along\nthe bank towing some-thing?), carol singing, The\nLord Mayors Show and not\nonly British but Italian\nTelevision.\nWe are confident that if\nthe present level of support for Bo is maintained,\nhe will go on as long as\nGuilds exists.\n\n"

    "content": "WHEN FELIX SPEAKS THE WORLD LISTENS IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 18th NOVEMBER 1971 No. 305\nUnion Autonomy\nTwo weeks ago the Government issued a \"con-sul tat ive document\" on the Financing of Student\nUnions which, if carried out, is bound to have\nfar reaching effects on the structure of ICU and\nall others like it.\nGOVERNMENT GREEN PAPER\nThe main points are as follows:\u2014\nPresent Arrangements\nResponsibility for approving union constitutions belongs with the university or college au-thor i ties. The unions are supported in the following ways:\n(i) accommodation and services provided by the\ninstitution; (ii) subsidy provided by the in st it u tion: (iii) membership subscriptions from local\neducation authorities; (iv) profits from their own\nactivities, trading, social activities and invest-ment s. Payment of Union Subscriptions\nMajority of full time students receive mandatory awards, part of which is paid to the union\nby the LEA.\nThere is considerable variation in the amount\nof union subscriptions. It is estimated that the\nannual expenditure on student unions is about\n\u00a33 million.\nDefects in the Present System\nThe main defects in the present system are\nas follows:\n(i) Local authorities have very little control\nover the level of subscription.\n(ii) Since subscription increases are paid by\nthe local authorities the system does not encourage careful inspection of union money.\n(iii) At the moment some unions spend compulsorily obtained money on activities more\nsuited to voluntary contribution.\n(iv) Part-time students may prefer not to join\nunion.\nPossible Courses of Action\n(i) A Registrar to provide some form of control\nover union operation.\n(ii) Make union membership voluntary.\n(iii) Make unions compete for money with\nother university departments.\nProposed New System\n(i) All students are automatically members\nof the union of that institution without paying\nany subscription but they may still use union\nfacilities.\n(ii) Individual clubs are financed by increased\nsubscriptions from members.\n(iii) Unions would be financed by college\nauthorities.\nUNION MEETING\nICU's immediate reaction to this was to call\nan emergency union meeting which succeeded\nin filling the Great Hall. At this, a motion was\ndiscussed condemning government interference\nin union affairs and calling for a National Day\nof Action eventually to be followed by a National\none-day closure of all colleges in Great Britain.\nThis was passed by an overwhelming majority\nbut not before various amendments had been\nattached. The last paragraph was amended,\nmaking a one-day closure possible without the\nsupport of the college authorities. Two new paragraphs were added, making a total of 10, asking\nfor the support of the trade unions and the\nparliamentary Liberal and Labour parties. A surprise motion, passed by a large majority\ncancelled Morphy Day. The proposer suggested\nthat it was inconsistent for students who wanted\nto show that they were responsible adults to disrupt traffic and generally behave in an anti-social\nmanner.\nUNION FLEXIBILITY\nIt is interesting how inflexible the union constitution appears to be when dealing with almost\nanything that crops up at a meeting. For example,\nthe final note on the motion. This could not\nactually be voted on until someone had formally\nopposed the motion. Does this suggest a positive indication of unanimous membership is im-possible?\nCORRECTIONS\nSo much for the general background but\nwhat does it all mean? Before that, however,\nthe straightforward inaccuracies can be dealt\nwith:\u2014\n(i) The survey supported by NUS was in fact\nconducted with the hope of bringing polytechnic\nunions up to the level of university unions. This\nhas not, in fact, been published and so the\ngovernment is using it out of context.\n(ii) It is claimed that neither the Government\nnor the UGC has any control over union subs.\nApart from being untrue it implies that union\nmanagement is so irresponsible as to raise the\nfees for no reason. In fact, people standing for\nofficial union positions must show themselves\nto be highly responsible, otherwise they just won't get elected.\n(iii) The paper says that colleges are not strict\nenough in their vetting of student money. Again\nuntrue, as the union has to submit detailed information to get grant increases.\n(iv) Students often vote money to causes unrelated to the university, e.g., political move-ment s. This appears to have substance as it\ndoes happen. However the money used for\nthese payments is that collected as profit from\nunion activities and it is quite justifiable, if a majority agree, that this money may be used\nfor anything. In the case of Sussex, who tried\nusing public money for an ultra-vire s payment\nfurther legislation is unnecessary as this is already an unconstitutional Act by the union.\nSOLUTION\nThe suggested \"solution\" to these problems\ninvolves removal of compulsory subs, to unions,\ngiving the extra money to the student. This\nwould remove a college union's ability to speak\non behalf of students of that University. Money\nbeing allocated by the college to the union would\nmake funds dependent on good relations with\nthe college, which is by no means certain. The\nthird part of the proposals involves removal of\nthe union subsidies to clubs and societies. This\nwould be immediately disastrous to those with\nhigh overheads.\nWHAT'S HAPPENING?\nSo far, only facts have been dealt with, but\nsome speculation on what the Government is\nthinking about might be interesting. Early this\nyear, JUS was involved in lengthy discussions\nwith HMG about the possibility of increasing\ngrants. Nothing was then decided; at the time of\nNUS conference in April there were no proposals to discuss. Surprisingly enough (?) the\nGovernment said what they were prepared to give\nonly two weeks after this, and consequently, very\nlittle discussion occurred. In the light of this\nit seems odd that these ideas on Student Unions\nshould be published only weeks before the next\nNUS conference where they are bound to be\nvery fully discussed. There are various conclusions to be drawn from this. Possibly they are\ntrying to see how much they can effect without\nproducing undue criticism. Alternatively they\nmight be hoping for a great fuss about the idea\nof voluntary membership, with NUS passing\nvarious motions about it. They will then offer\nto negotiate on the proposed system eventually\ngiving way to NUS demands. Thus, we are\nthereafter likely to have union sub sidi sed clubs\nand societies, but will find registration necessary.\nThe Registrar's powers could be so wide-ranging\nthat union self-government could be altered or\ndestroyed.\nPLAN OF ACTION\nICU's reply to this is thus to totally reject\nthe plans and to plan a long-term campaign\nagainst them. Yesterday there was a march of all\nUSK colleges to the DES to protest \u2014 I was\nassured that given good weather, about 2000\nfrom USK were expected.\nOf all recent legislation this is the most likely\nto affect individual students. It is not something\nwhich will gradually occur, it is planned to make\nthe changes next Autumn. The most important\npoint to remember is that no actual division in\nParliament is necessary for all this to become\nlaw. The proposals will be presented and unless\nsomeone wishes to discuss it, nothing can be\ndone to stop them. Thus our only hope is to get\nenough people in the country as a whole interested so that discussion occurs. More than\nmoral support is called for i The\nImpossible\ntakes a little longer\nAnd so the intrepid band of Felix reporters, including no less a personage than the editor\nhimself, set out to obtain, by fair means or foul,\nphotographs of the Miss World contestants.\nA phone call to the Albert Hall gave us the\nnecessary information \u2014 the organisers, who\nwere the people to see about press tickets, could\nbe found at the girls' hotel in Grosvenor Square.\n\"They must be expecting trouble \u2014 they've\ngot the army guarding the door.\"\nLeaving the American Embassy we went up to\nthe first floor of the hotel via the ultra-modern\nlift, complete with piped music.\n\"Sorry dears, they've all left,\" was the first line\nof defence, but the fearless reporters were not\nto be stopped so easily. However, \"Superman\"\nmanaged to persuade us that perhaps we didn't really want those pictures after all. Downstairs\nagain and another phone call to the Albert Hall:\n\"Sorry, we can't help you.\"\nThe only course of action remaining was to\nsit and wait for the girls to come out. The\ncamera was set up at the back door where we\ncaught our first glimpse of Miss Malta. (It is\nonly a small island, not many people); meanwhile several coaches pulled up outside the\nfront door. We arrived there just in time to see\nit disappear round the back, but managed to get\nsome very good pictures of the coaches.\nBack to the Albert Hall in record time (the\npoliceman blinked, so we didn't get caught for\nspeeding) to find several rows of police and\nWomen's Lib. demonstrators between us and\nthe contestants.\n\n"

For\nthe new leader was not just simply born but grew in\nthe style of all true leaders.\nIt all began with an emergency drive for economy.\nSave, save and hang the cost. I speak, of course, of our\ngood friend Mrs. T. Her true rise to power began, when she was appointed to lead the Department of Education and Science.\nShe only practised her economy drive in a small way\nat first with her 'every family should keep a cow in their\nback garden' campaign, and she was most unjustly\naccused of penny-pinching. Shocked by these accusations, power rushed to her head and she began to\nproduce her master plan to save not pennies, but milIons of pounds. Indeed the whole annual higher education bill.\nThe plan began with a seemingly harmless step. A practice adopted by all the more successful business\nestablishments which she applied to student unions.\nGiving away every facility you have, was the obvious\nroad to success for any business and as expected\nstudent unions went broke and passed away quite\nquickly and quietly. But wait; next came the masterly\nstroke. Once student unions were removed students\ndon't have any entertainment and they can't fight any\nfurther legislation. It is obvious now that as they aren't distracted from their work they can do their degree in\ntwo years. A brilliant idea and as nobody grumbled\n(how could they without a union) two year degrees\nbecome the thing to do.\nStill, all good leaders have their Waterloo. As planned the students that haven't committed suicide have\nhad to leave college on mental grounds and so we have\nsaved the cost of all the silly universities, haven't we?\nAlso we've made all that money from selling the buildings so what's wrong? Could Mrs. T. have forgotten\nthat she has also a responsibility to educate people as\nwell as watching her budget. Complete removal from\nthe Department of Education and Science is the only\nreward for this woman. If every student plays his part\nand does everything in his power to fight this stupid\ngreen paper, with luck she may get it.\nThis issue of Felix, the newspaper of Imperial College Union,\nwas edited by Dave Sugden, aided and abetted by Tony Upton,\nOily 'Credits' Dowson, Dave Gribble, Andrew Melvin, Colette\nRobertson, Ross McBeath and Bernard Williams.

Unfortunately\nthis was done only as aP.R. action, we students\nbeing told that the cancelation was in reality just\na postponement, which (in\nour opinion) is a shame.\nWe would really like to see\nthe students here waking\nup to their responsibilities;\nnot continually pursuing\nsuch actively destructive,\npointless and futile exercises as Morphy Day.\nLet's face it, Morphy\nDay and its contemporaries might do more than totally alienate public op in ion. It might even be a factor in dear Maggie's decision itself. Perhaps our\nfavourite government now\nfeels that this green paper\ncould now drift through\nthe parliamentary motions\nand become law, simply\nbecause the paper doesn't matter to the \"average\nman\".\n\"Who cares? Bloody\nhooligans anyway\". He\nmight say.\nThe only answer we at\nI.C. could come up with for\nsure is that we care. And\nover this particular issue\nwe do. With respect, its\nabout time!!

What we should do\nis try to lose our apathy,\ntry to become involved as\nmuch as possible, try not\nto waste our valuable non-work time.

For\nsome unfortunate plastic\nmilk bottles there is nothing more we can do\u2014they\nhave been melted down to\nun recognisable lumps, but\nwe can save others this\nignominious end. Luckily\nfor us these plastic bottles\nare not unreasonable. It is\nnot too late to make amends for our past undoings\n\u2014they are willing to forgive and to forget. Surely\nit is now up to us to go out\nand meet them half-way?\nWe cannot alter the past,\nbut we can assure them of\na better future, and a better tomorrow.\nPerhaps there are a few\nniggling doubts left in\nyour mind? You wonder\nperhaps where we can\nstore these aesthetic ob-j ect s?I do not refer to the\nfive or six hundred plastic\nmilk bottles every family\nwill keep around their\nhouse\u2014Five or six hundred that give their home its\ninformal \"lived in\" appearance so greatly prized\nnowadays. No. We are concerned with the millions\nthat we will surely possess\nin a few years time.

Glum\nfaces told all that needed to be known but everyone\nsoon cheered up as the enjoyable pastime of waking\nup the Union officials was discovered. Jowitt was particularly troublesome and two phone-calls had to be\nmade just to make sure he was still awake. By the time\nthis had finished more distractions were made available by the steady increase in outlandishly dressed\npeople. However, the event of all this was the attempt\nto give away lunch tickets. Originally the Vice-President\ntried to do this by calling names out but complications\nset in as he explained that the groups that people's names were called in indicated the float that they were\non. This might have been alright if the name of the\nfloat had been mentioned at the same time but predictably nothing so obvious occurred.\nWHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS? The first thing we noticed at the start was the large\nnumber of multi-coloured floats crowded into the side\nstreet. Floats about Banks, Insurance, were at the front\ncovering subjects from 'the spirit and adventure which\ncharacterize the insurance business (??) to Banks, a' '\u2022 ' Sill, \u2022!\nservice to the people'. In the former was a representation of the 'Golden Hind' with a number of people\ndressed in Elizabethan costume C and G students, were\nthe 'Bank managers' and people at work and play' in\nthe latter. The Metropolitan Water Board float had their\nown pop group. Sundry unusual electric cars followed\nthis with the theme of clean students dressed in white\nand blue costumes were driving them and generally\nmaking the point. Surprisingly enough they too were\nfrom C and G and by that time I was beginning to wonder if there was anyone else there! However this illusion didn't last long as the next float happened to be\nCity University who had produced a large cash register\nto symbolise the part played by the City of London in\nchanging foreign currency into sterling. Attention was\nsoon diverted from this when the amplifier was turned\non on the C and G float. With this blasting out large\namounts of noise vaguely resembling pop music almost\nnothing else could be heard\u2014especially City who had\nonly a rather feeble public address system. C and G, with a theme of 'Students Today\u2014Engineers Tomorrow',\nactually had about six of its female members on the\nfloat, giving the misleading impression that this is the\nactual ratio of male to female in the college. Little did\nthe crowds know that this is about the total actually in\nthe place!\nAbout this time concern was expressed that the public might not know who we were, as a 'Boomalaka'\nwas thought necessary, and so at 11.20 there was the\nfirst of many, assisted by the amplifying system. Someone pointed out that all the lamp-posts had the C and G coat of arms printed on them. Well, it's quite true, they\n:|j| f.. RE mm did, but unfortunately most people think of these as the\nCity of London's. With the show about to start it was\nsuddenly realised that the Vice-President, responsible\nfor organising (?) everything, had not turned up and\nsome interesting comments were made! However, he\nwas eventually vindicated when found to be organising\nthe collection. This raises another point as to how\nC and G happened to be the only College licensed to\ncollect for charity during the show.\nAt last, the actual journey had started. Most of the\npavement along the whole official path was packed ten\ndeep, which is an incredible number of people.\nSOME HIGHLIGHTS The Lord Mayor on being pressed to contribute to\nthe Rag Charities, said 'I'm sorry but I 've no loose\nchange'. Bo, of course, had to make an attempt to catch\nup with the C and G float. However, after a few yards at\n30 mph the police stepped in (?!!) and some cautionary words spoken into the driver's ear robbed CrimSoc\nof yet another member. Attempts by City to dampen the\nspirits of C and G with a couple of water pistols, failed\nmiserably.\nLunch was a totally disorganised affair, with practically anyone being able to get in just as well, otherwise\nhalf of the people involved would have starved. None of\nthe 'invisible men' who did most of the collecting had\nreceived lunch tickets.\nVictoria Embankment was the most exhilarating part\nof the day, coming out at just the right time. Since it is\na dual carriageway Bo found no difficulty at all in finding us and various U turns found her right behind us.\nAgain an apologetic Mr. Jowitt found himself listening\nto the police!\nOPEN AIR SHOW After the show someone had the great idea of taking\neveryone back to South Kensington on the float. So we\nfound ourselves sailing down Oxford Street with the\nmusic full on and generally distracting the shoppers.\nThis was about as much fun as the actual parade with\nquite a bit of money being collected from passing cars\nand pedestrians. An experience not to be missed is\npublic reaction to a 'Boomalaka' outside Selfridges!\nAll in all this is a great tradition worth perpetuating if\nonly for the fun public and students alike get from it.\n(Many thanks to Brian Darling, John McCullough,\nRob Armitage and a happy chain of coincidences which\nled to this article).\nNews in Brief MISPRINT\u2014AN APOLOGY\nReaders may have been\npuzzled by an article entitled \"IN THE MUCK\nHEAP\" in the last FELIX.\nThey may have wondered\nwho or what dogs would\nbe encouraged to \"de-face\". Of course, this was\na printing error, and should\nhave read \"defecate\". The\nmeaning of the piece\nwould also have been\nclearer had the title not\nbeen changed from \"IN\nTHE SHIT\" by a nameless\nintermediary between author and reader.\nLunchtime O 'Boobs.\nA GOOD BANK TO HAVE\nBEHIND YOU\nFurther to last week's mention about bank\ncharges, you may be lucky\nenough to receive a letter\nsimilar to that Midland sent\nto one of our scouts, which\nread \"we do not propose\nto charge your account...\nin view of your family's connection with the Bank\nfor many years.\" We hope\nto bring a comparative\nlook at bank charges in\nthe next issue.\nIMPERIAL NOBELLED\nDennis Gabor, Emeritus\nProfessor at I.C., is to be\ncongratulated on his recent windfall of \u00a336,000,\nnot to mention the Nobel\nPrize for physics. FELIX\nis glad to refer readers to\na previous issue of I.C. News for the full write-up.\nGUYANA, NOT GHANA\nBWANA\nWe apologise for implicating Carl Seaford in\nrecent allegations about a Ghana passport. The country concerned, as Carl was\nanxious to stress, is in fact\nGuyana. Anyway, its still\nnot British!\nOPENING TIME\nRegardless of promises\nto the contrary, Southside\nShop is extremely tardy in\nopening. You should not\nrely on purchasing breakfast provisions if you intend to get to a9.30 lec-ture.\nLunchtime O 'Breakfast.\nCONGRATULATIONS\nTony Kirkham, last\nyear's deputy president,\nhas finally got his MSc. All\nthe bodies on Felix would\nlike to send their heartiest\ncongratulations to Tony\nand all those involved in\nbringing about this 8th wonder\u2014we didn't fink it\nwere possible.\n\n"

(The\nidea of this race was to en-different in general aspects\nthis year\u2014the absence of\nthe towpath battle, the innovation of a third race\nand the christening of the\nnew boat by Lady Penny.\nThe innovation of the\nyear must have been the\nrace between the \"rug ger eights\". After practising\nonly in the tank, three\ncrews of non-oarsmen performed creditably in their\nfirst outing. Over the half-mile course there was an\nexcellent st rug gg le between Mines and Guilds.\ncourage maximum use of\nour facilities anywhere and\ncreate more interest in\nconstituent college con-tests?).\nIn the Lowry Race there\nwas probably the best race\nfor first place. Guilds and\nR.C.S. were in strong contention for the whole race\nand only in the final 400\nmetres did Guilds manage\nto draw away and win by\none length. The hardworking Mines crew was\nleft in the wake of this tremendous struggle between\nGuilds and R.C.S. In the Morphy Race the\nsuggestion that the conditions favoured the powerful Guilds crew proved to\nbe correct. From the start\nthe Guilds left the Mines\nand R.C.S. boats in an exciting and excellent race\nfor second place. Through\nPutney Bridge there was\nnothing to choose between\nthese two crews with\nGuilds well ahead. At the\nBoathouse the Guilds won\nby three lengths and\nR.C.S. had managed to\ncreep ahead by a third of\na length from the Mines.\nUnder the expert guidance of the Umpire Tom\nSutton, the races were\nstarted smoothly and without incident \u2014 even the\nrug ger eights. The three\nevents provided the constituent college contingents with some exciting\nand excellent races\u2014congratulations to all crews,\nespecially the rug ger eights.\nIn the gathering gloom\nof the evening Lady Penny\nchristened the new shell\ncox four in the traditional\nmanner. May the Boat\nClub thank both the Rector\nand Lady Penny for attending Morphy Day.\nHOCKEY\nSaturday, 30th October.\nOn Saturday IC trekked\nout to Shenley for their\nmatch against UC. Unfortunately both teams were\none player short, which\nnever marred an exciting\nand hard game. Both teams\nelected to be one toward\nless, and consequently the\nremaining attack became\neven more determined. IC\nbegan a little shakily, being\nlucky not to have conceded a goal in the first\nminute, but soon rallied\ndespite UC actually scoring early in the second\nhalf. The equalise r came\nsoon afterwards and the\nmatch seemed destined\nfor a11 draw. However in\nthe last minute of the\nmatch with one IC player\nalmost passing-out (?!)\nfrom a severe clout with a hockey stick UC forced\nthe ball into the net and so\ntook the game to 2-1. However the result could have\neasily been reversed and\non the whole IC put up a very creditable perform-ance.\nIs t XV Show Mixed Progress Yet again another literary masterpiece from your\nroving reporter giving you,\nthe general public, all the\ninformation as to how the\nfirst rugby team are pro-gres sing. The team has\nbeen going through an indifferent phase in the season having lost 4 of the\nlast 6 matches. These\nwere: Rosslyn Park Stags\n(8-13), UC (8-12), Bedford\nWanderers (3\u201414) and\nTwickenham (13-17); the\nother two were victories\nagainst Ealing Tech. (14\u2014\n3), L.S.E.(12 \u20149). Some\nof the matches are described in detail below\n(how boring\u2014Sec).\nAgainst Bedford Wanderers on Saturday, 6th November, after a riotous (?)\nbonfire night at Harlington,\nl.C.1 st XV turned in a superb performance to\nhold the second team of\npossibly the best club in\nthe Midlands to a3 \u201414\ndefeat. I.C. were under intense pressure for most of\nthe game, since the Bedford attack dominated all\nthe possession by their\nsheer physical size. However, l.C. defended their\nline superbly well after suffering the setback of an\nearly try by the Bedford\nthree-quarters. After somebody cocked up a penalty\nkick in front of the posts\n(I wonder who??) Bedford\nwent further ahead with a breakaway try. So the halftime score was 8-0 in Bedford's favour. I.C., in the\nsecond half, were playing\nin the wind and slope and\nalthough went 14 points\ndown early on, came back\ninto the game more and\nmore as time went by,\ncoming very close to scoring (especially McDonough, after a wonderful 30-yard touch line run, only to\nbe caught by the cover a few yards short) on several occasions. However,\nBedford held out and James kicked a penalty goal\nright on time to bring the\nscore to 3\u201414.\nTeam: J. Hughes; J. McDonough; B. Baines; D. Osborne; P. Loftus; A. James (Capt.); C. Flanagan; M. Sugrue; H. Michael; C. Wrigley; C. Humphries; R. Matthews; A. Tebbett; I. Partridge; T. Morris.\nOn Sunday, 7th November IC played Twickenham\nin the second round of the\nMiddlesex knockout cup\nand were defeated by 17-13.\nElecting to play in strong\nwind in the first half IC\nwere soon in the lead with\na penalty from James. IC\nincreased their lead to 9\npoints when Hughes made\nan entry (?) into the line\nto send McDonough over\nin the corner\u2014the try being converted by (what's his name?). IC thus turned\nround and faced the stiff\nbreeze and found themselves level when Twickenham scored a penalty and\na converted try. Twickenham went further into the\nlead after as c rummage when their scrum half\npicked up to score. 13\u20149\ndown, lC came back\nstrongly with much vocal\nsupport from the soccer\nfans (?) of the student\nhouses and were rewarded\nwith a try right on time\nwhen from a short penalty\nTebbett took the ball on\nthe burst to hand on to\nJames who scored near\nthe post. He did however,\nmanage to br up the\nkick and so the game went\nto extra time with Twickenham scoring first to clinch\nthe game.\nTeam: with-held for security reasons, but known\nto consist of 15 players.\nFinal bit of bullshit coming up. This Wednesday\n(or last Wednesday, depending on when you read\nthis), anyway 10th November, IC played LSE and\nwere victorious by 12\u20149.\nLSE won the toss and decided to play into the wind.\nIC had to defend for the\nfirst few minutes but they\nsoon came back into the\ngame. IC opened the scoring when from a misdirected relieving kick from the\nLSE defence the ball went\nto full back J. Hughes who\ndropped a40 yard goal,\nmuch to the embarrassment of someone who\nshall remain nameless. After a period of heavy pressure IC went further ahead\nwhen Pilkington picked up\na kick from James to send\nMcDonough over in the\ncorner (again!). This try\nwas superbly converted\nfrom the touch line by\n(you've all guessed wrong-ly;) P. Earl making a guest\nappearance for the first\nteam. So IC turned round\nwith a9 point lead. This\nwas eventually whittled\ndown by LSE who drew\nlevel, although in fact the\nIC team had been doing\nmost of the attacking in\nthe second half. It was left\nto the magical boot of Earl\nto give IC a deserved vic-tory.\nTeam: J. Hughes; J. McDonough; P. Pilkington; D. Osborne; P. Lofts; A. James (capt.); C. Flanagan; M. Sugrue; P. Earl;\nC. Wrigley; C. Humphries;\nR. Matthews; I. Rhys; I. Partridge; A. Tebbett.\nLATE FLASH\nHew Michael, celebrated\nCaptain of Vice of IC Rugby Club wants it made\nknown that he actually\nscored another try, against\nEaling Tech. some time\nago. This must be some\nsort of record since he also scored against Avery\nHill to make a grand total\nof two for the season so\nfar. Well done Hew!!\nEDITORIAL\nThe proposed Government's reforms on Student\nUnions, will, if they are\nimplemented, certainly\ncurtail the present freedom that students have in\nthe financing of their activities The threat is that\nstudents in future will have\nno control on the amount\nof money that the College\n(i.e. the Government) gives for student use and\nthere is also the possibility\nthat students will no longer have any say in how it\nis spent.\nWith respect to sports\nclubs within IC, a grant is\nreceived from the general\nUnion funds which is ably\nmanaged by the Athletics\nclubs committees and externally audited. This is\nthen divided amongst individual clubs to sub sid is e equipment, stationery and\nentertainment of visitors.\nIn the proposals there is\nno provision for any such\ngrant aid; in fact they\nspecifically state that clubs\nfinances must be found\ntotally from the membership or fund raising events\nwhich will mean that the\ncost of sports to the individual student will rise\nquite dramatically.\nThose clubs with expensive equipment may even\nhave to cease their activities whilst even the popular and co-called \"cheap\"\nsports will find membership hard to come by when\nwe can visualise the clubs\nbeing composed of only a hard core of enthusiasts.\nThe student who plays his\nsport mainly for enjoyment\nwill not be able to afford\nthe increased subscription\nand consequently the cost\nwill be even higher for\nthose who can pay. Clubs\nwill also not be able to\nplan in advance because\nthey will be unsure, year\nby year, exactly what this\ntotal budget will be.\nIt is the policy of ACC\nto make sporting facilities\neasily available to all students and it would be a disaster if the present system in Universities which\nallow students to be introduced to new sports, many\nof which they would be\nunable to take advantage\nof outside college, would\nfall apart completely; the\nstudent would only be able\nto do as little as he can\nafford.\nThe Union, at its EGM,\nwas almost unanimous in\ncondemning these proposals and has supported the\nLondon College's march\non Wednesday, 17th November, and it was hoped\nthat all sports fixtures\ncould be cancelled so that\nall members of the teams\ncould attend.\nFor notice of further action that is to be taken,\nthen the Union meetings\nshould be attended when\nthe latest information on\nthe situation will be made\navailable.\nOBITUARY\nMr. W. Beauford, Chairman of ACC, has recently\nbecome engaged.\n1st CLASS 1st XI\nKIBBUTZ\nWhat's it all about. Stay with\nus for a month or more as a working visitor and discover\nfor yourself. Scheme for the\nyoung 18-30. Apply now for\ndetails to the Kibbutz representative,412 Regent Street,\nLondon SW1. Please enclose\nfair size s.a.e.019305151 X333.\nWe are now over half\nway through the Autumn\nTerm and IC soccer teams\ncontinue to beat the best.\nBoth the first and second\nXl's are still unbeaten.\nIt has been said many\ntimes before that to have\na successful first team a club must have a strong\nsecond team, this certainly applies at IC, and our\nsecond team is good and\nskilful as many other College first teams, and most\nof the present second team\nhave at some time played\nfor the first and equip\nthemselves extremely well.\nIn fact, last Wednesday\nBill Pyke made his debut\nfor the first XI and scored\na hat-trick in a4 \u20141 win\nover UC\u2014a fine perform-ance. With potential of this\ncalibre lurking in an exceptional 2nd XI, the first\nXI players have to put\neverything into their game\nto secure their place, and\nwith a more difficult fixture programme in the second half of this term, the\n1st XI will have to pull out\nall the stops to maintain\ntheir good start to the sea-son.\nAs well as the fixture\nprogramme, the IC team\nwill also have their sights\nset on the first round\nproper of the ULU cups on\nSaturday, 4th December.\nTraining for this has started in earnest this week,\nbut at present training sessions are somewhat under-subscribed, and I cannot\nemphasise enough that\ntraining is essential to a good Cup run, as well as\nsuccess in the league com-petitions. However, it is\nnot enough just to be fit\nand training sessions also\nprovide the opportunity for\n\u2022teams to get together more\nfrequently, to build a good\nteam and club spirit. With\nthis in view, we would like\nto see every team member\nat training on Tuesday and\nThursday lunch-times,\nmeeting in the Union gym\nat 12.30.\n1st XI: N. Bakewell; M. McGrath; R. Kill; C. Willcock (capt.); M. Pearson;\nN. Fryer; I. Rogers; B. Smith; B. Pyke; J. Kelly; B. Milne.\n\n"
