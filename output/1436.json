It is unfortunate however that this seems to be the\nonly DJ Jazzy Jeff tune which has ever\nseen the light of mainstream day. Only\nrecently did I discover that rather than\nsimply playing the fall-guy in The Fresh\nPrince of Bel Air and being repeatedly\nejected from the famed West Philadelphia household by Uncle Phil for various youthful misdemeanours, he is actually a real-life professional musician\nwith real-life professional funky-fresh\nbeats. I urge you all to check out his releases The Magnificent and The Return\nof the Magnificent for all of your summertime block-party requirements.\nWith exam season coming to an end\nand illegal BBQ in Hyde Park season\nstarting up in earnest, now more than\never is the perfect time to take heed of\nmy great opinions.\nFresh Rancid Album\nAfter like a billion years, Rancid have returned from punk-rock gereatricity with a new release. Ushnish Banerjee reports\nNorthern California-based ska punk\nfour-some Rancid return with a new\nstudio album Let the Dominoes Fall,\nnearly six years after their last release\nIndestructible in 2003. The highly anticipated release is finally seeing the\nlight of day after two major delays in\nthe writing process, as major Stateside and European tours over the past\nfour years always seemed to hint at\nimminent release dates which never\ncame. However, fans will discover that\nthe long wait for fresh songs has not\nbeen in vain as the band seem to exhibit a new and rejuvenated spirit with\nthis new batch of\nsongs produced\nby Rancid\u2019s\nself-professed\n\u2018fifth-member\u2019\nBrett Gurewitz. Starting off with\nthe infectiously lighthearted \u2018East\nbay night\u2019,\nthe inception\nsets the tone\nfor the\nsing-along and anthemic aura of the album.\nSongs like \u2018Up to No Good\u2019 still reference Rancid\u2019s ska, reggae and two-tone\ninfluences like Desmond Decker and\nBooker T (who happened to contribute to the album) in easy listeners and\nheavily groove based tracks that could\nget any spliff-laden dancefloor moving\nwith ease. \u2018Last One to Die\u2019 is a standout track: a strong statement from the\nband regarding the faith they have in\nthe longevity and timelessness of their\nmusic in the face of skeptics and the ev-er-changing landscape of music. Songs\nlike \u2018Disconnected\u2019 and \u2018Liberty and\nFreedom\u2019 continue much in the vein\nof the politically-motivated thematic\ngrounds as their previous records, by\npoignantly speaking out against the\ninjustices faced by the average work-ing-class American. Rancid are one\nof the few punk bands to successfully\ncombine hook-laden musical gems\nwith intelligent lyrical wizardry in one\npowerful formula for breeding great\nsounding songs with intelligent lyrics.\nSongs like \u2018New Orleans\u2019 and \u2018Highway\u2019 are simple and down-to-earth in\ntheir arrangements and address life on\nthe road and the almost school-boy\ninnocence of wanting to make music\nwith your friends. Rancid have always held that strange and\nenviable power of writing\nsongs which evoke a feeling of community and\nbrotherhood amongst\nthe listeners and they\nwill most likely be\nsuccessful in maintaining this special\nconnection\nUshnish Banerjee\nRancid\nLet The Dominoes Fall\nAda Label Group / Epitaph\nHHHHI\nwith their fans with this album.\nConsidering that the majority of\nthese songs were written in an acoustic format and then converted to a\nplugged format means that they all\npossess a great raw vibe and if you listen with that in mind you can almost\ndeconstruct the songs to what might\nhave been their skeletal acoustic tem-plates. This album is not powerful\nbecause of innovation or for breaking\nnew creative grounds, as it does not. It\nis powerful because it is an honest, raw\nand humble record made by a bunch of\nguys who have rekindled their\ndesire to make music\nagain.\n\u201c...one of the\nfew punk bands\nto successfully\ncombine hook-laden musical\ngems with\nintelligent lyrical\nwizardry\u201d\nMarco Carola\u2019s roots in techno go back\nthe best part of two decades and a\nquick glance at the size of his discography shows his prominence up to this\nday. However, it\u2019s not his production\ntalents that make him stand out, it\u2019s his\nability to play great tunes for hours on\nend. Some may call it mundane mini-mal, but his rare talent of cutting music\nup into a relentless groove, keeps the\ndance-floor bouncing all night long.\nThe man from Naples graced Fabric\nwith his presence last Saturday and the\nItalians were out in force. Taking over\nthe ones and twos at four in the morn-ing, he had a bit of a task trying to reawaken the crowd, as the warm-up of\nheavy electro was not really what the\npeople had come to hear. Two minutes\nafter taking over, the place was packed\nout \u2013 everywhere\nyou looked,\npeople\nwere loving it.\nThere are\nnot many DJs in the world that can play\nfive-hour sets and keep the energy going throughout. Imagine trying to see\nPendulum keep a dance-floor filled for\nfive hours straight, an event that could\nonly ever happen if they branched out\nfrom their monotonous 10-track repertoire that everyone seems to love so\nmuch.\nSo for all you people out there who\nhave yet to hit Fabric on a Saturday, all\nI can say is DO IT. Every Friday they\nhave the same DJs, and lets face it every drum and bass / electro / dubstep\nDJ has exactly the same record box and\nplays pretty much the same set as everyone else on the bill. Saturdays lineups may look pretty empty, but if you\nnotice who they get, Ricardo Villalobos, Chris Leibing and Marc Haule, to\nname but a few, you realise that, sure,\nyou only see one big DJ in a night, but\nthese guys offer something different\nweek-in week-out. Saturdays offer a\nbetter night all-round than seeing the\nScratch Perverts or Crookers who always play the same set or even worse,\nhave a whole box of tunes that sound\nexactly the same (especially true for\nthe latter). So for once, give up Fridays, where you will spend\nthe whole night being\ngrinded by a sweaty\nchav and check out a\nSaturday where the\nmood is definitely\nmore chilled and\nthe beats are\ndefinitely\nbetter.\nJack Massey\nMarco Carola live at Fabric\n19\nFriday 12 June 2009 felix\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood\nFood Editors \u2013 Rosie Grayburn & Afonso Campos\nLaunceston Place HHHH\n1A Launceston Place, W8 5RL\nwww.launcestonplace-restau-rant.co.uk\nBest bits: Amazing Value. A\ngood alternative for the Summer\nBall Dinner!\nWorst bits: Saving up requires\npatience but is well worth it.\nPrice: \u00a318 per head plus service\nW\nhile it is true that\nsome people are\nlosing their jobs,\nothers are moving\ninto negative equity and we are destined for at least four\nyears of a Conservative government\nwho\u2019ll (probably) round up the poor\nand put them on dynamo connected\nbicycles to provide green energy to\npower the bourgeois, I must admit the\ncredit crunch isn\u2019t all bad. As the high\nearners have had their bonuses reduced and expense accounts are generally not quite so abused as they once\nwere, no-one is eating out for lunch.\nConsequently, some outrageous deals\nare to be had between noon and 2:30.\nYou can get the best food and the best\nservice in the country for less than half\nthe price it would cost otherwise. You\nmay not have the delights of fillet steak\nor turbot on the menu, but I\u2019d easily\nsacrifice these for ox-cheek and good\nfresh mackerel anyway.\nA case in point is Launceston Place\n(5 mins west from Imperial College).\nFor the meagre sum of \u00a318+service,\nwe enjoyed a three course menu with\ntwo interjections : amuse bouche and\na pre-dessert. In light of its chef\u2019s current (deserved) celebrity courtesy of\nthe Great British Menu, this must\nsurely the best value meal in the coun-try. Even students can afford this: it\u2019s\nthe only six or seven trips to the Sandwich Shop after all.\nThe interior had changed since I was\nlast there. It used to be decked out like\na series of miniature interconnected\ndrawing rooms, with books on mantlepieces and richly coloured wooden\nfurniture. Now it is all sleek black and\nwhite, no doubt to better frame its\nModern European food. The maintenance of the cubby hole style layout remains one of its selling points ,though.\nIt means that even if the restaurant is\notherwise empty, you don\u2019t need to feel\nlike you are rattling about in a huge hall\nwhere the staff are listening to your\nevery word.\nThe richest macchiato of cauliflower and truffle oil constituted the\namuse bouche. The starters were hard\nto fault. Pea and ham soup enjoyed a\nsmoky overtone courtesy of the home-smoked ham from which the stock for\nthe soup was made.\nA slow cooked duck egg covered in\ntruffle shavings was a deliciously perfumed ooze. My dish was a scallop\nwhich had been opened, dressed with\nspring onions and a light sauce and\nthen reclosed with puff pastry. One\nopens it at the table with a quick twist\nof a knife, adding a wonderful piece of\ntheatre to what might possibly have\nbeen described as a slightly too subtle\ndish.\nSandwich shop can wait\nDavid Stewart visits our local celebrity chef, Tristan Welch\nOne reason to come here is that they haven\u2019t called their \u2018credit crunch\u2019 menu \u201cCredit Crunch Munch\nLunch\u201d. Thank God. They should have named the economic downturn \u201cCredit Orange\u201d so none of these\nrhyming atrocities could have occurred.\nIn the main courses, the beef was easily the worst dish. While the meat had\nbeen slow-cooked to a mound of perfect cascading ribbons, the sauce and\naccompanying roasted tomatoes had\nmore in common with pizza topping\nand canned breakfast accoutrements.\nThe best main (which was remarkably\nfamiliar, being the chef\u2019s competitor\u2019s\ndish from the Great British Menu!)\nwas a posh fish-finger served with peas\nand tartare sauce. A T-bone pork chop\nsat, in terms of quality, somewhere between these two.\nThe famous soft-scoop ice-cream\nfrom the programme appeared as a\npre-dessert, livened up with a gingery\nsyrup at the bottom. Of the deserts, an\napple pie for two could not have been\nmore calorific or delicious, while Eton\nMess was fine.\nThe chef needs more consistency\nwith the dishes perhaps, but there is\nno doubting that at an average of four\npounds per course, this food is being\ngiven away.\nAfonso Campos\nFood Editor\nI think I need\nsome more cider\nT\nhe summer is a slightly\nnon-sensical time where\nno one is really sure what\nis actually happening when\nor where. The days are\nslowly becoming longer and time awareness is dissipating faster than al-fresco\ndiners are lining up the streets of fashi-noable Chelsea eateries for fancy events.\nAs far as gastronomic summer events\ngo though, there is one whose scent\nhas never escaped my foodie radar.\nEvery year Regents Park plays host to\na most magnificent of events \u2013 The\nTaste of London.\nDespite the flowing champagne\nand Pimm\u2019s, Taste is not merely an\nexcuse to drink to oblivion. The\nevent takes food and its entire industry very seriously and wants you\nto do the same. Stalls from London\u2019s\nbest restaurants dot the Park and\nyou are hypnotised by the aromas\ngracefully eminating from each of\nthem. Anyone who is anyone of relevance to the world of cuisine (From\nGordon Ramsay to Tom Aikens) has\nshop set up at the event. I do not\nbelieve this a self-promotion event\nhowever. I\u2019d rather see it as passionate people trying to pass on some of\ntheir ideas onto the general public.\nMost of these restaurants do not\nnecessarily need the (extra) public-ity, but have come together with others in the field to provide you with\nan evening, that if properly taken advantage of, you shan\u2019t forget.\nIt isn\u2019t all about the restaurants.\nSome of the world\u2019s best suppliers\nand most innovative food companies\nare there to showcase exactly what\nthey have in the pipeline. There is\nno lack of producers selling award-winning wines and spirits at heavily\ndiscounted prices. The day is not all\nabout capitalism though. Great effort has been made to turn this event\ninto a small educational symposium\nwhere you are able to learn about anything from wine and champagne to\nseafood in the proper way; by tasting\nand hearing from the experts. I genuinely recommend the event despite\nits somewhat hefty entrance price.\nCheck out more at: www.tastefesti-vals.com/london .\nOn another note, this week I have\nwhat I believe to be a great treat in store\nfor you guys. We are lucky enough that\none of my closest friends, Marta Bobi\u0107\nhas provided us with a brilliantly written\nreview of Albion Caffe, a little, but honest East London joint. Marta is not only a\nfantastic writer, but also (and I have had\nplenty of proof of this in the five blissful\nyears I have known her) an outstanding\nchef. She is not merely a cook, for her\nrecipes are more often than not, her very\nown. They tend to have this je-ne-sais-quoi about them. It is usually in the form\nof a completely unexpected ingredient\nthat serendipitously blends with everything else in perfect harmony, or simply\na spark of genius in conceptualising what\nyour taste buds most love and need. She\nhas the gift of taking the simplest of salads or sandwiches and adapting them\ninto an eating experience that is quite\nsincerely, out of this world.\nDespite not being an Imperial student,\nI think we can expect many more recipes\nfrom her over the course of next year. .\nOn a more Imperialy note, I do hope\nyour exams have gone well and you have\nhad a great term. Expect a very interesting issue next week. Until then, loyal\nfoodies.\nPeach and\nTomato Summer\nSalad\n\u201cI thought I would start with salads as it\u2019s that time\nof year. I purposely didn\u2019t put quantities in them,\nas I think I like the idea of people adapting them to\ntheir own tastes and experimenting\u201d \u2013 MB\nSlice a few ripe peaches and a roughly equal amount of good, ripe\ntennis-ball sized tomatoes (plum or golden heirloom are best) into\nsemi-circles, add wafer-thin slices of red onion and a handful of\nchopped parsley.

It was attended by two\nmembers of staff from the humanities\ndepartment.\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare), Hannah Theodorou, said that\nalthough there were concerns about\nthe other humanities cuts - including\nModern Literature and Drama and\nMusic in Western Civilisation - it was\nlanguages courses that students had\nbeen more vocal about.\nThe first suggestion made by Council was to keep Japanese, the second-most subscribed course at Imperial\nwith 202 students enrolled, to the level\nthat it is currently taught. Addressing\nthe concerns of some academics that\nlower level languages are not worthy of\ncredit within an undergraduate degree,\nCouncil recommended that Levels 1\nand 2 of each language should count\nfor credit in all but the final year of a\ndegree.\nACC Chair, Sam Furse, put forward\nthe proposition that it was more important to save languages such as Arabic, Japanese, Chinese and Russian\nwhich students would find more difficult to learn themselves through books\nand other resources. This was strongly\ncontested by the DPEW, as well as SCC\nChair, Peter Mabbott, who reminded\nMr Furse that those wanting to study\na language at Imperial are more likely\nto want to learn it from a course than\nfrom books.\nA draft copy of the report that will be\nput to Senate was circulated to Council members before submission this\nmorning. It says that whilst the Union\n\u201cagrees with the recommendation that\nthe Humanities Department should\nbe in line with the College\u2019s strategic\naims\u201d, the Union also believes that Imperial is a \u201ctruly international university [and] supporting the development\nof student\u2019s language skills can only be\nin line with these strategic aims\u201d.\nThe report also argues that teaching\nlanguages helps with \u201cstrengthening\nour relationships with international in-stitutions, both for undergraduate and\npostgraduate as well as research opportunities\u201d, as well as helping students to\nstart a language from scratch to allow\nthem to take part in the Year Abroad\nprogramme later in their degree. It\nnotes that \u201cInstitute of Engineering\nand Technology, Institute of Mechanical Engineers, Institute of Chemical\nEngineering, Institute of Physics, Royal Society of Chemistry and the CBI\nall have specific statements about the\nvalue of language programmes within\ndegree courses\u201d, but that the majority\nof them agree that basic communication skills are far more important than\nfluency.\nArguments for saving Arabic included the fact that the College has recently\nestablished a new Diabetes Centre in\nAbu Dhabi. The main blow to students\nis the Union\u2019s decision not to support\nthe courses in Russian, which are important to many students within the\nRoyal School of Mines. The Russian\ncourse is regularly the least subscribed\nlanguage course at Imperial, and it\nseems that the opportunity to study it\nis likely to be taken away from the few\nwho do rely on it for applying for jobs\nin the oil industry.\nsee more at live.cgcu.net\nLawrence Weetman\nlive.cgcu.net\nSam Furse, ACC Chair, quizzes Hannah Theodorou (left) over the\nproposed report to Imperial College Senate\nICU Colours \u201809\nHalf Colours\nAmit, Gilead\nAtteck, Charlotte\nAymanns, Christoph\nBirkett, Chris\nBonney, Karl\nBose, Rahul\nButler, Richard\nCampos, Afonso\nChooi, Kok Yean\nCiucci, Alessandro\nCule, Erika\nDzigal, Naida\nGandhi, Nikita\nHafeez - Bore, Omar\nHaywood, Tom\nHill, Ian\nHopper, Christopher\nIllingworth, Joe\nJones, Sammy\nJones, Heather\nKassim, Amirah\nKwek, David\nLai, Richard\nMackenzie, Strachan\nMarrouche, Jad\nMoorhouse, Ben\nMurdoch, Charles\nNakagawa, Fumiyo\nPall, Ravi\nPiatek, Stef\nPoynton, Edward\nRogers, Oliver\nRowlands, Alice\nSkeen, James\nStanley, Claire\nTibbott, James\nTurner, Seb\nUllah, Moazzam\nVyas, Katya yani\nWaldie, Rich\nWelsby, Peter\nYip, Grace\nZard, Monya\nFull colours\nAyadi O\u2019Donnell, Najette\nBaldwin, Adam\nBalikhin, Alexander\nBottrell, Nathaniel\nChooi, Phin\nClements, David\nCornish, Jack\nDhanoa, Luke\nDowning, Jon\nEriksson, Inger\nFurse, Sam\nHolme, Margaret\nLevy, Rupert\nMoran, Tim\nMozaffari, Ali\nNamih, Chris\nNubert, Stefan\nPatterson, Kirsty\nShubber, Kadhim\nStubbens, Ben\nOutstanding Service Award\nChang, Eugene\nCharles, David\nD\u2019oliveiro, Rachel\nHarrington, Mary\nMauthoor, Soumaya\nWagner, Dan\nWilson, Jenny\nFellowship\nCommon, Hamish\nGrisman, Alex\nMabbott, Peter\nSaunders, Ellin\nPresident\u2019s Award for Clubs &\nSocieties\nIC Fencing\nPresident\u2019s Award\nCharles, David\nNedi\u0107, Jovan\nPower, Phil\nThis year\u2019s Imperial College Union Colours and President\u2019s Awards have\nbeen announced. Congratulations to everyone who received recognition for\nthe hard word and dedication throughout the academic year.\nThe world beyond\ncollege walls\nThe oil company Shell is\npaying $15.5m (\u00a39.5m)\nto settle a case accusing\nthe company of human\nrights abuses in the Niger Delta in the early\n1990s.\nThe out-of-court settlement came days before\nthe trial in New York was\ndue to start, the culmination of efforts by relatives of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent critic of the Nigerian government and Shell who was hanged in 1995. Shell was accused of\nasking the then Nigerian military dictatorship to silence Mr Saro-Wiwa and\nothers like him.\nIn a statement on its website, Shell said it has \u201calways maintained the allegations we false,\u201d but that the payment to Mr Saro-Wiwa\u2019s relatives would\n\u201cassist the process of reconciliation.\u201d Nigerian activists have promised to\nmaintain pressure on Shell over the issue despite the settlement.\nThe legal case is another example of challenges being brought against\nmulti-national oil companies in developing countries. In 2002 Angola fined\nChevron for causing oil spills on its off-shore platforms and in 2004 Unocal was accused of using slave labour in the construction of a pipeline in\nBurma.\nNigeria\nWhile not known for its cultural heritage, many of Afghanistan\u2019s looted\ntreasures are returning to the country.\nGreek fortresses of Alexander the Great, ancient shrines of Buddha, objects of Islamic art and remnants of Genghis Khan\u2019s Mongol empire all lie\nbeneath Afghanistan\u2019s soil.\nBut since the Soviet invasion in 1979, hundreds of archaeological sites\nhave been looted by desperate peasants and warlords who have made a lucrative business of smuggling the ancient antiquities out of the country. The\nyears of Soviet occupation, civil war and US and NATO invasion have made\nthe smuggler\u2019s task very easy, and even now the 500 special police officers of\nthe Afghanistan Ministry of Culture can only do so much.\nRecently in London 1,500 items were seized by customs officers at Heathrow Airport. The priceless objects were identified and catalogued by staff\nat the British Museum, before being returned to Kabul Museum. While the\nrecovered items are a boost to the collection there, they are but a fraction\nof objects already lost.\nAfghanistan\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nCalifornia\u2019s school\ntextbooks will be going digital as Governor\nArnold Schwarzenegger announced plans\nto phase out hard copy\ntextbooks.\n\u201cTextbooks are out-dated, in my opinion,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cFor so many\nyears, we\u2019ve been trying\nto teach the kids exactly\nthe same way.\u201d\nIn a bid to slash state spending to reduce California\u2019s budget deficit,\nschools will stop buying \u201cantiquated, heavy and expensive\u201d textbooks. Instead children will learn through textbooks via computers and other digital\naides, although how the necessary quantity of electronic devices is going to\nbe provided is still unclear.\nCalifornia, the home of Silicon Valley and a world leader in technology,\nwill be the first state ever to trial such an initiative, initially with Maths and\nScience textbooks only, and will start later this year.\nUSA\nIt is a case of alternative medicine,\nonce again, in dispute with science.\nEx-RCSU President and Physics undergraduate Simon Singh has successfully been taken to court by the British\nChiropractic Association (BCA) after\nhe claimed chiropractic treatment as\n\u201cbogus.\u201d His challenge to the verdict\nagainst him has since brought mass attention to his cause.\nWriting in the Guardian newspaper\nin April 2008, Singh stated the BCA\u2019s\nclaim that chiropractic healthcare is\nable to treat children\u2019s colic, feeding,\near and asthmatic problems is unsubstantiated without a \u201cjot of evidence.\u201d\nHe goes on to say the BCA \u201cis the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments.\u201d\nThe BCA responded to his writings\nby suing him for libel, after considering his comments as \u201cdefamatory and\ndamaging to the BCA\u2019s reputation.\u201d\nGiving Singh the opportunity to retract his allegations, he refused to do\nso.\nThe court case has been initially successful for the BCA, with judge\u2019s ruling that what Singh had published was\n\u201cnot comment but serious defamatory\nallegations of fact against the BCA.\u201d\nSingh has been since forced to pay legal costs of the proceedings.\nSoon after the judge\u2019s initial verdict,\nThe Guardian quickly offered to pay\nfor BCA\u2019s legal costs in a out-of-court\nsettlement on the condition that Singh\nDan Wan\nEditor-in-Prowling\nSingh in libel case over\n\u2018bogus\u2019 chiropractic claim\ndid not appeal. However, Singh has not\ntaken up on this offer and is moving\nforward with an appeal.\nIt is a case that is now attracting\nworldwide debate amongst legal and\nscientific circles. There is concern that\nBritish libel laws are restricting free\ndiscussion within science. Commentator and Nature magazine blogger, Imperial\u2019s own Professor Stephen Curry,\nhas called question on the use of legal\nthreat in place of scientific proof to rebuff challenges of scientific credibility.\nHe says that science \u201cmust be strong\nenough to call into question any and\nall claims.\u201d\nThe charity Sense About Science\nhas subsequently launched a \u201cKeep\nLibel Laws Out of Science\u201d campaign,\nwhich includes a petition, in favour\nof Singh. A statement on their website (www.senseaboutscience.org.uk)\nfirmly states \u201cthe that law has no place\nin scientific disputes.\u201d The petition,\ncurrently with over 7000 signatures, is\nto be issued to the Government with\nsight of alterations of legalisations.\nSingh has been fervently supported\nin his case against the BCA by professionals not just science, but from\nacross the spectrum. Stephen Fry, Richard Dawkins and Ricky Gervais are\nsaid to be supporters.\nSingh\u2019s reputation an internationally\nrenowned science author and educator earned him an MBE in 2003. Since\ngraduating from Imperial College, he\nhas published four books and worked\nas science producer and director for\nthe BBC.\nSimon Singh was President of the Royal College of Science in the 80\u2019s\nHave you seen our lecturer?\nWith less than a month until results\nare due to be posted, and while most\nof their peers are relaxing after handing in final projects, a number of Mech\nEng third and fourth years have had to\ndesert the bar in favour of cramming\nfor a viva that may be used to decide\n80% of their grade for the Microprocessors course. While oral exams are\ncommon place in some departments,\nthe step is unprecedented within the\nMechanical Engineering department,\nleaving some students concerned that,\nhaving no previous experience to help\ntheir viva technique, they won\u2019t perform to their full ability in a course\nworth as much as 1/5 of the whole of\nfirst year.\nThe Microprocessors course has\nbeen causing headaches since before\nthe start of term, with last year\u2019s course\nlecturer taking early retirement at\nshort notice; leaving the course without a suitable lecturer within Mech\nEng. Unwilling to let a popular course\nslip of the curriculum, or be taught\nby someone under-qualified to teach\nit, the Mechanical Engineering senior staff turned to other departments\nin search of a suitable lecturer; the\ncomputing department suggested Mr\nCraimer \u2013 a teaching associate, would\nbe a good candidate and described\nhim as \u2018a good teacher\u2019. Run during\nthe autumn term, Mr Craimer decided\nto make a number of changes to the\nmanor in which the course was taught;\nwhile students conceded he was good\nAlice Rowlands\nNews Correspondent\nat explaining concepts, their were complaints that the course was difficult to\nfollow, poorly structured and the final\nobjective unclear.\nIn light of these concerns, Mechancical Engineering Senior Tutor, Dr Shaun\nCrofton and Director of Courses, Dr\nPat Leevers met with Mr Craimer to\ndiscuss problems that had arisen with\nthe course. Following their discussion,\nDr Crofton and Dr Leevers were confident Mr Craimer would be able to\naddress problems that occurred in the\nfirst term, when the course was run\nagain in the spring term.\nAs far as the staff were concerned,\nthe course ran more smoothly in the\nsecond term, until the staff-student\ncommittee meeting, two weeks before\nthe course was due to end, when it\nbecame clear that the course was still\nin a state of confusion, with the final\npiece of coursework- worth 80% of the\ncourse still unset.\nWhile addressing the issue of unset coursework, it became clear Mr\nCraimer was suffering from \u2018ill health\u2019\nleaving him unfit to complete teaching\nthe course.\nFurther investigation within the computing department found Mr Craimer\nwas under considerable pressure as a\nteaching associate, and had been told\nhe was about to lose his job due to cuts\nin funding. Unconfirmed reports from\nwithin the computing department suggest attempts to contact Mr Craimer\nhave failed and he may have a number\nof reports and exam scripts, leaving\nsome students concerned about when\nthey will receive their grade.\nComputing department staff have\nfailed to respond to a request from felix for an interview, while Mechanical\nEngineering have been left trying to\nfind a fair manor in which to decide\ngrades for students taking the course\nin the second term. Dr Leevers told\nfelix: \u201cWe\u2019re exploring several ways to\nmake sure every student gets a fair and\nreasonable assessment for this course.\nWe and DoC already talked to each one\nand viva\u2019ed them individually on the\nwork they submitted. But in the end,\nas always, the way this information is\npulled together is up to the examination board and our external examiners.\u201d\nWhile Senior Tutor, Dr Crofton wished\nto make it clear students should not be\ndisadvantaged by taking the course: \u201cIt\nis a shame about the outcome of this\ncourse and considering the circum-stances, we will try everything we can\nto make sure the student\u2019s are not disadvantaged by it.\u201d\nThough it is clear the Mechanical\nEngineering department are doing everything within their power to reduce\nany impact on student grades, there is\nconcern that following the unsatisfactory way in which the course was run\nin first term, Mechanical Engineering\nfailed to monitor the progress of the\ncourse during the second term, and\nhence were unaware of problems until\nit was too late to set proper assessment.\nOn a wider scale, this story may indicate increasing pressures on academic\nstaff, during a recession, to spend time\non research, produce papers with a\ndetrimental impact on undergraduate\nstudent education.\n\n"

Doesn\u2019t\nit seem like only\nyesterday that all\nthe new eateries\nsprouting up were colourful places\ncrowded with murals and complicated\nlight fittings, their fancy names displayed in even fancier typefaces? Their\ncrockery was angular, glass, slate or\ncrackle-glazed ceramic, glasses were\nfaceted and jewel-toned, chintzy teacups were perched on artfully mismatched gilded saucers. Paintings and\ntessellated photographs adorned walls,\nstaff wore quirky uniforms and, well,\nthe food was equally as busy. Fusion\nwas in fashion and, though spectacular when done well, haphazard confusion was commonplace, crowding the\nmenus like lacquered d\u00e9coupage on\nthe tabletops.\nThank goodness then, that a gen-tle, nostalgic and very, very serious\nrevolution has been taking place in\nLondon. Food grew up. Food is no\nlonger fancy, overly sophisticated or\nunpronounceable, but just grown up,\nwith a distinguished silver streak in\nits well-groomed hair. Just like a need\nfor roomy vehicles and an unavoidable fondness for jazz, the newly old-fashioned grown up menu is serious,\nsimple and really quite ordinary. Coloured walls have faded to glossy white\ntiles; the plates (as everyone inevitably\ndoes) have grown rounder and whiter;\nthe cappuccino froth melted away\nto inky filter coffees once more and\nbrunch woke up a little earlier and became breakfast again (though in some\nplaces, it lingers until dinner). Over\nthe past couple of years, a number of\nunassuming sans-serif bakeries and\nrestaurants have sprung up all over\nthe city, all white tiles, red type and no\nmiso black cod or sesame macaroons,\nwhere the food\u2019s title is all you\u2019ll find\non your plate. This new fraternity of\nestablishments includes Canteen, St\nJohn, Gail\u2019s, Peyton & Byrne, Melrose\n& Morgan and most recently, Albion,\na self-proclaimed caff on the ground\nfloor of Terence Conran\u2019s new hotel\nventure, The Boundary, sandwiched\nbetween an upscale restaurant in the\nbasement and a roof-top bar and grill\nupstairs. The former Victorian industrial building is tucked away in an unlikely \u2013 but growing ever more likely\n\u2013 lane near Shoreditch High Street,\na few metres from its antithesis, the\ncomplicated taxidermy-adorned Les\nTrois Gar\u00e7ons, and cheekily close to\nmembers-only colossus Shoreditch\nHouse.\nIn its own words, Albion serves\n\u201ctypical British caff food, nothing challenging or complicated, just\nstraightforward hearty ingredients\nand recipes.\u201d This pretty much sums\nit up, and even though \u201ccaff\u201d is perhaps a term more often conjuring up\nEven the Bard would be proud of this Albion\nMarta Bobi\u0107 finds out what sets Albion apart from the rest of a million trendy East London eateries\nAlbion Caffe HHHH\n2-4 Boundary Street, Shoreditch,\nLondon E2 7DD\nwww.twitter.com/albionsoven\nBest bits: The cakes and breads\nare divine\nWorst bits: Absolutely no way to\nreserve a table\nPrice: Very reasonable\ngreasy spoons and Eastenders, Albion\nhas taken these simple and classic\noften-craved dishes and made them a\nlittle more presentable for its public,\nwithout needlessly making them more\nsophisticated (read: complicated) ei-ther. The menu is British, nostalgic,\ncomforting and \u2013 rather cheeringly\n\u2013 not at all health conscious, though\nunlike standard caff food, Albion\u2019s fare\nis thankfully not swimming in grease.\nFood is served from 8am to midnight\nevery day, with breakfast stretching all\nday and no main course costing more\nthan \u00a310. There is a shop at the front\nof the restaurant stacked with not-exactly-cheap groceries, though their\nwell thought out selection is uplifting\nand resolutely British. Its refrigerated\nshelves are filled with goods to cheer\nanyone up halfway through a slow\nwork day, especially the enormous\ndoor-wedge sandwiches on fresh mat-tress-thick bread filled with coronation chicken or smoked ham and egg.\nThe most attractive feature of Albion is without a doubt the vast selection of reasonably priced (dare I say\ncheap?) breads and cakes on display.\nI defy any visitor to walk away without sampling one of the treats on offer,\nsuch as classic Victoria sponge cake,\nbakewell tart, battenburg, swiss roll or\nthe perennial favourite, sticky, chewy\n(50p!) flapjacks, solely responsible for\nthe golden syrup tins housing Sheffield\nsteel cutlery on each table. The bread\nand cakes are unbelievably fresh, and\nthis is something they are ostensibly\nproud of: Albion\u2019s oven has a Twitter\naccount. Yes, really. Occasional tweets\nannounce which variety of delicious\nhot baked goodness has recently escaped the oven (though thanks to Albion\u2019s no reservations policy, it would\nperhaps be more useful if their m\u00e2itre\nd\u2019 could announce available tables).\nThe dining room is a tall, white\nspace with large windows on one side\nand an open kitchen on the other, filling the room with a dizzying aroma of\nfreshly-baked everything. Spartan industrial light fittings hang above neat,\nbare wooden tables surrounded by\nred-seated wooden chairs more than\nslightly resembling wartime school\nchairs. Albion has a subtle sense of\nhumour \u2013 grown up, of course \u2013 to it,\nalbeit a very Conran-esque deliberate\none; Brown Betty teapots are dressed\nin knitted tea cosies, oak bar stools are\ntopped with former tractor seats and\nhot beverages are served in white china builders\u2019 mugs - Conran for Royal\nDoulton, what else?\nBreakfast is, amongst other things,\na kipper, alone and uncluttered with\nonly half a lemon and butter for com-pany, a breakfast bap of unbelievably tasty, chewy brown bread filled\nwith runny-yolk fried egg and herby\nsausages, or simply scrambled duck\neggs. Dinner is fragrant kedgeree,\nhearty Irish stew, golden-crusted\npies, chunky rarebit and salty, crackly\nroasts. Dessert is what everyone remembers fondly from school: steaming bread and butter puddings, fruit\ncrumbles, glossy apple pie and generally anything that welcomes a flood of\nhot custard.\nHopefully, this serious and honest revolution will catch on and put a\nsmile on the face of hungry London;\nwithin the tiled walls of these new\nplaces, simplicity and quality is forcing\na comeback. Not to mention that the\ninner child in all of us is being subtly\nindulged; how can even the most serious not giggle when faced with jelly\nand ice cream or battenburg?\nThe restaurant is inviting for small parties as well as relatively large groups for great, but relaxed meals\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood food.felix@imperial.ac.uk Food\nTake a Given Bloke or Bird. Suppose\nthis Given Bloke or Bird were not a\nstaunch member of the Campaign\nfor Real Ale (Camra). Then, on being\nasked his/her opinion on real ale (s)he\nmight say something like this:\nReal ale? Urm. Flat. Warm. Dank.\nProbably has some Middle Earth\nname like \u2018Hobgoblin\u2019. Drunk by old,\nfat, bearded, smelly men with bits of\npork scratchings stuck in their pubes.\nServed in some vile pub which gives\nlife to a horrific dystopian reimagining\nof normal social interaction. You know,\nhell, pitchforks, evil and so forth. The\ndrinks industry and the Campaign\nfor Real Ale are well aware of the impression that some people entertain\nof \u2018real ale\u2019 (a phrase of Camra\u2019s own\ncoinage). Part of the reason for the\ninception of Camra back in 1971 was\nto change this sort of opinion; in that\nrespect it was remarkably successful\nand it provides an excellent case study\nfor where getting-off-your-arse-and-doing-something-about-it is a genuinely effective philosophy. Back in the\nseventies, real ale was an animal on the\nbrink of extinction, as lagers (which\nat the time had a reputation as a girl\u00eds\ndrink) swept through the country and\nbecame the drink de la mode of men\nas well as of women. Lager\u2019s popularity was maintained by virtue of its tasting of little and its being chilled down\nto the point where it tastes of nothing\nat all, thus offending no-one. That it\nis also carbonated, I am sure must be\ncomforting to those brought up on a\ndiet of Pepsi or Coca Cola. Real ale\u2019s\nthreatened existence could not be entirely blamed on consumers, though.\nThe so-called \u2018keg beer\u2019 alternatives to\nlager being offered by the huge breweries at the time (who had Britain\u2019s pubs\nin a half-nelson), were typically rancid\nand disgusting. To put it into context,\nJohn Smith\u2019s was counted as one of\nthe better examples in a raft of sewage\nwhich included Watney\u2019s Red Label\nand various upsetting offerings from\na company called Whitbread. Real ale\nwas being tarred with the same brush.\nSo Camra began. It campaigned so vociferously and ubiquitously that it effectively destroyed the keg beer industry and put real ale (back) into pubs up\nand down the country.\nWhat it is, why it is so much better\nthan lager and why we should all develop a taste for it is the subject of the\nrest of this article. I should start with\na definition: \u2018Real ale [as defined by\nCamra] is a beer brewed from traditional ingredients (malted barley, hops,\nwater and yeast), matured by secondary fermentation in the container\nfrom which it is dispensed, and served\nwithout the use of extraneous carbon\ndioxide.\u2019 Although it is most recognisable as the liquid which pours out of\none of the hand pulled pumps at the\nbar, notice that the definition permits\nbottle-conditioned beer to be counted\nas real ale. So much for the \u2018what it is\u2019.\nThese are the reasons it is good: tradi-tion, typicity, intensity and complexity\nof flavour, variety.\nI\u2019ll elaborate on these in no particular\norder. Firstly, lagers all taste the same.\nThe people that claim to hate one or\nother lager and like others are deluding themselves. If you don\u2019t believe me,\nget half pints of three or four lagers of\ndifferent types, mix them about and\ntry to work out which one it is that you\nthink you hate. Without heavily promoted labels to guide you, you\u2019ll soon\nfind that they taste bewilderingly simi-lar. Certainly there is not enough of a\ndifference to claim that you hate Stella,\nfor instance, which many people say\nthey do. On the other hand, if you gave\nme a few popular real ales to identify,\nchances are I could tell you precisely\nwhich one was which. I don\u2019t claim this\nas some super-power. It only requires\nthat you spend a bit of time thinking\nabout what you\u2019re drinking and the\ndifferences become crystal clear. This\nis essentially the meaning of \u2018typicity\u2019.\nIt is a fairly new word which has been\nborrowed from the French typicit\u00e8 by\nthe wine industry. It is broadly identifiable with the word \u2018recognisability\u2019.\nReal ales, as opposed to lagers, have\nrecognisable flavours, which mean that\nthey fall into broad categories like Porter, Stout, Mild, Summer Ale, Best Bitter and so forth. Within that category\nindividual beers have dramatically different personalities, which are the result of choices made about ingredients\nand production methods, including\nthe water used. (You wouldn\u2019t believe\nhow much difference changing the\nyeast has, for example.)\nHistorically, Anglo-Saxons are not\ngreat at preserving traditions, seeming\nto prefer the latest thing from abroad.\nThe French and Italians on the other\nhand have had various appellation\nsystems in place to preserve traditions\nfor centuries. It was only last year that\nMelton Mowbray pork pies and Cheddar cheese got recognised by the EU.\nAdmittedly not all traditions are good,\nbut provided they are not doing anyone any harm, there\u2019s much more to\nbe lost by not maintaining a mediocre one. Otherwise it is one possible\nexperience which disappears from\nthe menu forever. What I\u2019m saying\nof course is simply that variety is the\nspice of life. Britain is the only country\nwhich makes a substantial amount of\nreal ale and I would argue that it is far\nfrom a mediocre drink. So what is to be\nour national (alcoholic) drink? Fosters?\nPinot Grigio? Vodka and coke? Or real\nale?\nIt shouldn\u2019t even be necessary to\nask the question, to my mind. So why\nshould real ale be in constant need of\nsaving? There is a quality issue. The\nmembers of Imperial College do very\nwell in ploughing though a lot of naff\nbeer from the Union. Put it in one of\nthose awful plastic skiffs and I could\nthink of many places I\u2019d rather be.\nThe Union isn\u2019t atypical though. Many\nlandlords simply do not have the skills\nnecessary to keep beer properly. Without going into the details, believe me\nthat there are number of steps which\nmust be followed scrupulously to generate a good pint. What results is a\nfeedback system. If everyone loved real\nale, they would go where it was good,\ncomplain where it was bad and places\nwould have to up their games to provide the punters with what they wanted rather than just filling pint glasses\nwith fizzy piss. Then people would\ndrink more of it because it was better,\nintroduce their friends to it etc. etc.\nWomen. There are several reasons\nwhy women don\u2019t, as a rule, tend to\nflock to real ale. Chronic perception\nof it as a man\u2019s drink is important, of\ncourse, but even excluding that, there\nare some fundamental reasons why\nreal ale is unlikely to appeal to women.\nOne is the bitterness. A major component in beer is the hops which add\nbitterness and aroma in equal propor-tion. Women tend, biologically, to be\nmore sensitive to bitterness and rarely\nis there any sweetness in a real ale to\ncounteract this. Another issue is vol-ume. A pint, put in a global context,\nis quite a daunting amount of alcohol\nto have to imbibe. 330ml is the usual\nsize of a bottle. On the continent, one\nwould expect 500ml or less, rather\nthan the whole 568ml. I contend that\nit\u2019s a significant difference. A pint is\nan inelegant amount of liquid in an\ninelegant container. A wine glass is\ntulip shaped: a pint glass is about the\nsame size and shape as a full air-sick\nbag. So a glass of wine becomes a romantic present, a pint of beer merely\nsomething to be disposed of. Half pint\nglasses are hardly more elegant. (Note\nthough that the Belgians have solved\nthis problem already.) Whatever the\nreasons for the lack of female interest\nin beer, the industry goes out of its way\nto find or produce pictures of attractive women drinking pints. As such,\nthis is hardly a surprising gambit--it is\nused to promote every product from\ncars to contact lens cleaning solution.\nAs an example, the pictures above/\nopposite/below were used as part of a\nposter campaign run by Camra a couple of years ago, promoting Real Ale\nas an 100% NaturAle drink (get it?). In\nspite of these efforts though, women\nhave been elusive and wine remains\nthe drink of choice.\nOne last reason that real ale is less\npopular than it should be is its lack\nof a top end. Again, wine has a hugely\nglamorous image. Rappers routinely\nrefer to drinking Roederer\u2019s \u2018Cristal\u2019\nchampagne. Top Bordeaux sells for\nabout \u00a310k for a case of a dozen bot-tles. It would be mad to think that none\nof that trickles down to Jacob\u2019s Creek.\nSo there are certain things which\nneed changing and a lot of work left\nto be done by Camra and other lovers\nof real ale, but it\u2019s hardly all doom and\ngloom. Nary a week goes by without\nsome beer festival taking place somewhere in the UK and giving anyone in\nthe area chance to taste some fantastically different brews running all the\nway from the lemony tang of Timothy\nTaylor\u2019s Landlord or Dark Star\u2019s Hophead, though the mellow caramelly\ntaste of London Pride or Harvery\u2019s\nSussex Bitter through to the dark ba-cony mouthful of Kelham Island\u2019s\nSmoked Porter or the sumptuous St\nPeter\u2019s Honey Porter. These induvidual\ninteresting drinks are out there, they\u2019re\nrelatively cheap and they aren\u2019t available outside this sceptred isle.\nDavid Stewart is on the committee of the \u2018RSM Real Ale Sock\u2019.\nThe society will be attending\nthe Great British Beer Festival at\nEarl\u2019s Court, 4-8th August 2009\nand requests your company.\nPlease email realale@imperial.\nac.uk for details.\nHow to survive the summer on real ale\nDavid Stewart\n\n"

Loody-Doit\nSpirits were high as the inaugural ICU\nwinter polo tour got under way, though\nsome were definitely more excited\nthan others. Trish\u2019s cry of \u201cArgentina\nBaby!\u201d must have been heard across\nthe whole of Gatwick as the main\ngroup headed to check-in. However,\nthe mood was somewhat dulled when\nwe realised that the phrase \u2018you get\nwhat you pay for\u2019 applies just as well\nto airlines as anything else. The delays\nled to the fastest transfer Madrid airport has ever seen as they were faced\nwith a crazed German charging down\nthe corridor followed by an entourage\nof high velocity and rather apologetic\npolo players.\nWe did eventually make it to Buenos Aires, albeit without our luggage\n(presumably it did not share our urgency on the transfer). Still, all this was\nquickly forgotten at the sight of our ac-commodation; a lovely house set in the\nfabulous gardens. Donning borrowed\nor makeshift swimming costumes we\nchose to splash around in the pool until the rest of the group arrived. After\nonly an hour in the country the cool\nwater was much appreciated though\nthe sunburn was less welcome.\nThe second group arrived not long\nafter, having had a much less eventful\njourney. After their arrival it was time\nfor lunch in the sun and our first taste\nof Maria\u2019s cooking \u2013 none of us were\ncomplaining.\nHowever we were not just there to\nsun ourselves and eat great food. In\nthe early evening as the heat of the\nday wore off we got our first chance to\nride. An hour or two was spent practicing our swings and acclimatising to\nthe heat before the training began in\nearnest.\nThe first night set the tone for the\nrest of the tour; dinner, beer and banter\nuntil the early hours. Unfortunately,\nbedtime brought the mosquitoes; we\nwere surprised at how a creature so\nsmall can make such an irritating noise\nwhen you are trying to sleep and most\nof us were victims come morning.\nSunday was our first full day of polo,\nmore stick and balling with the instructors in the morning followed by\nour first chukka of the tour. We all dismounted our ponies on an adrenaline\nhigh and looking forward to the prospect of proper chukkas with the professionals that evening.\nFor anyone that has not played or\nseen polo it might be hard to understand the appeal. It is often described\nas hockey on horseback, a relatively\naccurate description given we spend\nour time blasting around a field hitting (essentially) a hockey ball with a\nlong stick, but the experience is more\nlike Top Gear\u2019s Hatchback Football;\nyou are placed in notional control of\nsomething far bigger, tougher, faster\nand more powerful than yourself and\nasked to race around trying to manoeuvre a ball between two posts, is\nalso relevant. Oh, and crucially polo is\na contact sport too\u2026\nWith all this in mind we were eagerly\nanticipating our matches in the after-noon. Splitting into teams with a professional in each one we played a small\nround robin. None of us can remember\nwho won but we all got stuck in, trying\n(and mostly failing) to get the better of\nthe opposing instructors.\nMost of the group made the trip to\nLa Martona to watch the locals play\nPHOTO BY PETER SPURRIER OF INTERSPORT IMAGES\nchukkas on the full pitches. There was\nsome excellent play and it also gave us\na chance to meet some of the people\nwe would be playing with. The skill\nlevel ranged from just above our level\nto international pros.\nAfter the chukkas we celebrated our\ninstructor Ollie\u2019s birthday with the\nhelp of the Argentine beer Quilmes.\nThis set the pattern for the week with\npolo morning and evening, playing as\nlate as possible to avoid the worst of\nthe heat. We also got the chance to\nhead to La Martona and play afternoon\nchukkas on the big pitches, which gave\nus the space to really get into the game.\nSoon even those beginners that had\ncome along were starting to make their\npresence felt on the pitch.\nEach morning soon began with our\npre-polo ritual of dressing various blis-ters, bruises and aching joints, with the\ntable in the front room of the house\nlooking much like a small and disorganised pharmacy.\nOn Wednesday we decided to leave\nEstancia and see what life in Argentina\nwas really like, so we headed to Buenos Aires for drinks and dinner. We\nwent to a trendy bar serving everything from excellent Argentine beef to\namazing sushi, all washed down with\nan incredible selection of drinks.\nA bit worse for wear, Alex had a\nrough night; upon returning to the\nhouse to find all the doors locked he\nhad to spend the night curled up on\nthe back seat of Ollie\u2019s car. However it\nwas less dangerous than the race to the\npool between Nik and Trish on commandeered bicycles which almost ended in disaster before Carlotta noticed\nthe lack of water!\nFor those of us with upcoming exams\nFriday was the last day of the tour and\nwe were eager to make the most of the\nfinal day of play.\nWith Ollie having to head back to\nthe UK in the morning to we also\ngained a new instructor, Tarquin. With\nEl\u00e9onore, Rosie, and Carlotta departing for Buenos Aires and their flight\nhome it looked set to be a quiet night,\npossibly with a good night\u2019s sleep for\na change. However, Tarquin had other\nplans and invited us out to the local\ntown for a night out.\nThe bar we went to was crowded; full\nof people and buzzing with conversation that none of us could understand.\nOne thing we did get to grips with\nwas the Argentine attitude to shots and\nmixers. \u201cSaying when\u201d is difficult when\nnobody knows the Spanish for \u2018when\u2019.\nHaving obtained the strongest drinks\nin the world we grabbed a table and\nbegan to shout conversation across the\ntable until the band started up.\nOur Saturday morning stick and\nballing was possibly the least energetic\nof all our days, with a few of us looking\na bit sea-sick on our ponies. With only\na few polo sessions left though we all\nhung in there to made the most of it.\nSunday was a mad rush to pack our\nbags and play as much polo as possible before the flight. We cut it fine,\nwith traffic in Buenos Aires upping the\njourney time by an hour. Jon, Megan\nand Trish had to convince the staff to\nhold the check in desk open while Alex\nand Nik raced into the airport in the\nsecond car. Fortunately, we all made it\nonto the plane (just!).\nArgentina was an incredible expe-rience; we got to play with a range of\nplayers from around the world and\nlearnt a lot. All of us were looking forward to getting back and putting the\nnew experience to good use - although\nwe had to wait a little while to do it,\nsince our luggage arrived a couple of\ndays later than we did.\n\u201cAfter the\nchukkas we\ncelebrated our\ninstructor Ollie\u2019s\nbirthday with\nthe help of the\nArgentine beer\nQuilmes. This\nset the pattern\nfor the week,\nwith polo in the\nmorning to avoid\nthe heat\u201d\n\n"

Adding their 2nd place in\nAachen for the IDEA League sports event, felix\nsport hope the men can step their game up and\nfinally gain promotion to the BUCS premiership.\nIC Fencing Women\u2019s 1st\nWomen\u2019s Team of the Year\nOne-third of the club of the year, the fencing\nwomen have been phenomenal. After a loss to\nOxford in the first game of the season, the ladies\nresponded by winning every game they played\nand beating Oxford in the return leg, resulting in\nwinning the Premiership and being crowned as\narguably the best women\u2019s student fencers on the\nland. Those pesky rivals at Oxford overcame our\nladies in the BUCS Championship Final narrowly\nwinning 117-115 in a tense encounter.\nAdam Freeman-Pask\nSportsperson of the Year\nAfter his outstanding performance reported last\nweek, it will be hard to find someone who has\noutshone Adam this year. Winning this award for\nthe second year running you wouldn\u2019t bet against\nhim equalling, if not bettering his achievements\nthis year, which include time trialling with other\nOlympic rowers and his bronze medal of course.\nfelix sport wishes Adam the best of luck as he\nsteps up his preparation and aims to appear in the\nLondon 2012 Olympics.\nImperial College Fencing Club\nClub of the Year\nWinning over four-fifths of their 31 games, the\nfencers have produced remarkable results. The\nwomen stayed ahead of long-time rivals Oxford\nover the course of the season to lift the BUCS Premiership Trophy. The men\u2019s 1sts will be in the\nPremiership next year after going unbeaten in 1A\nand eventually destroying Bath 135-37 in the Premiership Playoff Final. The 2nds, in a team mainly composed of 1st teams, finished a respectable\n2nd place in league 2A.\nfelix sport awards \u201809\nSports league\nTeam P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 Tennis Men's 1st 12 12 0 0 105 15 90 100 5.00\n2 Squash Men's 1st 12 11 0 1 51 9 42 92 4.25\n3 Fencing Men's 1st 11 10 0 1 1187753 434 91 4.18\n4 Fencing Women's 1st 11 10 0 1 1445 1160285 91 4.18\n5 Volleyball Women's 1st 9 8 0 1 17 3 14 89 4.00\n6 Hockey Men's 1st 13 11 0 2 65 19 46 85 3.62\n7 Squash Men's 2nd 13 11 0 2 40 21 19 85 3.62\n8 ICSM Netball 2nd 12 10 0 2 452 226 226 83 3.50\n9 ICSM Netball 3rd 12 10 0 2 444 225 219 83 3.50\n10 ICSM Badminton Men's 1st 6 5 0 1 28 20 8 83 3.50\n11 Lacrosse Women's 1st 11 9 0 2 162 43 119 82 3.36\n12 Table Tennis Men's 1st 15 12 0 3 163 88 75 80 3.20\n13 Badminton Men's 1st 12 8 2 2 61 35 26 67 3.00\n14 Netball 2nd 12 9 0 3 404 226 178 75 2.75\n15 ICSM Hockey Women's 1st 14 9 1 4 65 29 36 64 2.21\n16 Hockey Women's 1st 16 9 2 5 54 38 16 56 1.81\n17 Basketball Men's 1st 11 7 0 4 780 709 71 64 1.73\n18 Hockey Men's 3rd 12 4 5 3 23 30 -7 33 1.50\n19 Cricket Men's 1st 5 3 0 2 1001841 160 60 1.40\n20 Hockey Men's 2nd 12 7 0 5 50 36 14 58 1.25\n21 Hockey Men's 4th 8 4 1 3 19 23 -4 50 1.25\n22 Badminton Men's 2nd 11 5 2 4 49 39 10 45 1.18\n23 Squash Men's 3rd 7 4 0 3 14 9 5 57 1.14\n24 Fencing Men's 2nd 9 5 0 4 1100 947 153 56 1.00\n25 Badminton Women's 1st 12 6 1 5 57 39 18 50 1.00\n26 Rugby Union Men's 2nd 17 9 0 8 358 334 24 53 0.76\n27 Basketball Women's 1st 10 5 0 5 453 425 28 50 0.50\n28 Squash Women's 1st 12 2 6 4 20 32 -12 17 0.50\n29 ICSM Hockey Women's 2nd 11 4 2 5 27 43 -16 36 0.36\n30 Football Men's 1st 12 5 1 6 25 29 -4 42 0.25\n31 Tennis Men's 2nd 12 5 1 6 42 69 -27 42 0.25\n32 ICSM Football Men's 1st 13 4 3 6 17 26 -9 31 0.15\n33 Volleyball Men's 1st 9 4 0 5 10 10 0 44 0.00\n34 Football Men's 2nd 11 4 1 6 24 35 -11 36 -0.18\n35 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 2nd 16 6 1 9 271 244 27 38 -0.25\n36 Rugby Union Men's 3rd 15 6 0 9 264 324 -60 40 -0.40\n37 Tennis Women's 1st 10 4 0 6 44 56 -12 40 -0.40\n38 Waterpolo Men's 1st 3 1 0 2 12 32 -20 33 -1.00\n39 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 1st 17 5 1 11 306 467 -161 29 -1.00\n40 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 3rd 14 4 0 10 152 429 -277 29 -1.43\n41 Volleyball Women's 2nd 7 2 0 5 13 16 -3 29 -1.43\n42 Football Men's 3rd 11 3 0 8 18 33 -15 27 -1.55\n43 ICSM Football Men's 2nd 10 2 1 7 13 28 -15 20 -1.60\n44 ICSM Hockey Women's 3rd 9 1 2 6 11 39 -28 11 -1.67\n45 Cricket Women's 1st 4 1 0 3 323 297 26 25 -1.75\n46 Table Tennis Women's 1st 4 1 0 3 8 12 -4 25 -1.75\n47 Hockey Women's 2nd 11 2 1 8 10 46 -36 18 -1.82\n48 ICSM Netball 1st 13 2 1 10 314 497 -183 15 -2.15\n49 Football Women's 1st 10 2 0 8 11 34 -23 20 -2.20\n50 Rugby Union Men's 1st 14 2 1 11 165 430 -265 14 -2.29\n51 ICSM Hockey Men's 2nd 11 2 0 9 17 24 -7 18 -2.36\n52 ICSM Hockey Men's 1st 11 1 1 9 18 45 -27 9 -2.64\n53 Rugby Union Men's 4th 15 2 0 13 162 623 -461 13 -2.80\n54 Lacrosse Men's 1st 8 1 0 7 40 114 -74 13 -2.88\n55 Netball 3rd 12 1 0 11 127 452 -325 8 -3.25\n56 ICSM Badminton Women's 1st 11 0 1 10 11 78 -67 0 -3.45\n57 Cricket Men's 2nd 2 0 0 2 255 321 -66 0 -4.00\n58 Rugby Union Women's 1st 2 0 0 2 15 109 -94 0 -4.00\n59 ICSM Hockey Men's 3rd 5 0 0 5 0 15 -15 0 -4.00\n60 Netball 1st 11 0 0 11 220 428 -208 0 -4.00\nClub league\nClub P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 IC Fencing 31 25 0 6 3732 2860 872 81 3.26\n2 IC Squash 44 28 6 10 125 71 54 64 2.55\n3 IC Table Tennis 19 13 0 6 171 100 71 68 2.16\n4 IC Tennis 34 21 1 12 191 140 51 62 1.74\n5 IC Badminton 35 19 5 11 167 113 54 54 1.74\n6 ICSM Netball 37 22 1 14 1210 948 262 59 1.51\n7 IC Hockey 72 37 9 26 221 192 29 51 1.38\n8 IC Basketball 21 12 0 9 1233 1134 99 57 1.14\n9 IC Volleyball 25 14 0 11 40 29 11 56 1.04\n10 IC Lacrosse 19 10 0 9 202 157 45 53 0.74\n11 ICSM Football 23 6 4 13 30 54 -24 26 -0.61\n12 IC Cricket 11 4 0 7 1579 1459 120 36 -0.73\n13 IC Football 44 14 2 28 78 131 -53 32 -0.86\n14 ICSM Rugby 47 15 2 30 729 1140 -411 32 -0.87\n15 ICSM Hockey 61 17 6 38 138 195 -57 28 -0.90\n16 IC Waterpolo 3 1 0 2 12 32 -20 33 -1.00\n17 ICSM Badminton 17 5 1 11 39 98 -59 29 -1.00\n18 IC Rugby 63 19 1 43 964 1820 -856 30 -1.19\n19 IC Netball 35 10 0 25 751 1106-355 29 -1.43\nSPORTS PERSON OF THE YEAR AWARD\nAwarded for outstanding achievement in the past year, representing\nthe University at a level above and beyond that shown by others.

Apart from the tussle between\nthe netball 2nds and 3rd for the best\nMedicals team this year, a special\nmention goes to the ICSM badminton men\u2019s 1sts which achieved the\nsame scoring on the felix index but\nhave played less games.

After all, many musicals have been successful with much\nless than this and I expect Sister Act\nwill follow suit, yet even with these\ncomponents well executed the musical\nfelt empty as if there was a vital ingredient missing.\nFor those of you who have never\nspent a Christmas in front of British television, Sister Act the Musical is based on the film of the same\nname. Deloris, a lounge singer played\nby Whoopi Goldberg is placed under\nwitness protection in a nunnery. Hilarious hi-jinks ensue as Deloris revo-lutionises the church choir and learns\nall sorts of morals that come with this\nwarm fuzzy type of family film. The\nmusical has developed the gangster\nstoryline further adding three stooge-type sidekicks for Deloris\u2019s beau Shank\n(the striking similarity to Shaft is not\na coincidence). There is also now a\nlove interest for Deloris, Eddie, but I\nfelt this was added purely to increase\nthe male/female ratio. This storyline\nnever develops beyond Eddie asking\nDeloris to dinner and so seems a little\nsuperfluous.\nThe cast were fantastic \u2013 full of energy and with good characterisation\nof some parts that could otherwise appear flat and one dimensional. I knew\nPatina Miller was going to be good\nfrom seeing many a video of her performance as Dionne in the New York\nPublic Theatre production of Hair and\nI was not disappointed. Miller\u2019s voice is\nincredible and she had the spunk and\npersonality to live up to Goldberg\u2019s\noriginal portrayal of Deloris. She was\nwell-matched by Sheila Hancock as the\nMother Superior although I feel she\nand Ian Lavender\u2019s Monsignor Howard\ncould have been better integrated into\nthe story. Lavender in particular had\nvery little to do, acting more as an Emcee than a character in the story. A particular highlight for us was Julia Sutton\nas Mary Lazarus who gave a star turn\nas the aged rapping nun \u2013 she rocked!\nThe ensemble were all strong with\nsome amazing harmonies that led to\nmy \u201camazing harmonies grin\u201d appearing for a large portion of the show.\nThe score itself is fun and momentarily catchy if not memorable,\nstrangely I couldn\u2019t hum you any of\nthe songs now. The style and themes\nfitted well with the light, bouncy feel\nof the musical. Favourite songs included \u2018Fabulous Baby\u2019 sung by Deloris\nwhich cleverly interwove exposition\nwith funky diva vocals and \u2018Take Me\nto Heaven\u2019, the first number sung by\nthe revitalised choir featuring some\namazing solos and a Nun kickline! The\ncomposer Alan Menken is usually associated with the Disney musicals of\nthe early nineties; The Little Mermaid,\nAladdin and so forth, so one could be\nmistaken that he can only write child\nfriendly perky tunes. But lest we forget\nnot only were these songs clever, intelligent and (sometimes) Oscar winning\nbut they are far from his entire back\ncatalogue. Menken\u2019s first musical, in\nconjunction with his late lyricist partner Howard Ashman, was Little Shop\nof Horrors, a black comedy taking influences from 50\u2019s bebop, rock and roll,\nand Supremes-type girl groups. He\nhas taken the same approach with the\nscore using influences from the period\nof the piece such as Barry White, Shaft\nand seventies disco.\nUnfortunately somebody forgot to\ntell the set and costume designers of\nthis and so we see seventies style bookshelves containing DVDs and tramps\nwearing decidedly present-day hat/\ncoat combinations. Aside from this\noversight the set was magnificent and\ncompletely automated, there were no\nscene changes just scene transitions.\nThe way the nightclub set spiralled and\ncompletely disappeared into the stage\nwas astonishing. My friend and I decided we wanted to take the giant shining Mother Mary home to put in our\nliving room, what our other flatmates\nwould say about that is another matter.\nMacbeth: East-End London, the 60\u2019s\nDavid Lloyd ventures \u201coff West End\u201d to the Riverside Studios and witnesses one of Shakespeare\u2019s greatest\ntragedies, Macbeth, as close as one can get\nThey even had a sparkly gold version\nfor the finale \u2013 everything looks better in gold sparkles, even nuns\u2019 habits and prisoners\u2019 garb! The costume\ndesigner managed a minor miracle in\nmaking nuns\u2019 habits look attractive,\nI loved Sheila Hancock\u2019s fitted pur-ple-trimmed number and the novice\npinafore of Katie Rowley Jones\u2019 Mary\nRoberts. One issue with the set is that\nbecause it was so magnificent it took\naway from the action at times with\nsome movement being obscured by the\nconstantly moving set. The production\nrelied on the set to provide momentum\nhighlighting the patchy pacing in parts.\nAlthough this review may not appear\nencouraging, I did like Sister Act \u2013 it\nhad great acting, an infectious score\nand some intelligent moments. It was\nfun and frivolous and certainly not\na bad way to spend an evening. The\naudience of mainly coach parties and\n\u201cwomen of a certain age\u201d had a ball,\napplauding absolutely everything and\nrounding the night off with a premature standing ovation. If you\u2019re looking for a carefree evening with lots of\nlaughs then I\u2019d highly recommend it.\nSister Act follows in the long line of\nlight and fluffy movie to musical transfers that are well-made but never going\nto change the musical theatre world. I\nthink I just expected more from such a\nbrilliant creative team who were obviously trying to make a commercial success than something artistic and new.\nSister Act is on at the London Palladium until February 2010\nwww.sisteractthemusical.com\nfor information on the cast and\nperformances\nPatina Miller as Deloris, the company and the great, shining Mother Mary\nPatina Miller with one of the ensemble\nPatina Miller takes on the role of lounge singer, Deloris, played by Whoopi Goldberg in the film version\nA\nn East-end boozer isn\u2019t\nthe first place you\u2019d expect a Shakespearean\ntragedy to unfold but this\nis what I found when I\nwent along to The Riverside Studios to\ncatch a performance of Shakespeare\u2019s\nMacbeth. Set in the 1960\u2019s, but still\nretaining the original dialogue, the\nslicked back hair and sharp suits form\nan interesting contrast to some of the\nBard\u2019s most powerful dialogue.\nFor those who are neither Shakespeare fans, nor were obliged to study\nthe play at school, Macbeth is a tale of\none man\u2019s ascendency to the throne of\nScotland fuelled by a deadly ambition\nand the machinations of his poisonous wife. As in the style of any tragedy\nworth its salt the play ends with plenty\nof people being killed: in this case\ncharacters are dispatched by crowbars\nand Stanley knives. Just a normal day\nin 1960\u2019s London.\nThe quality of acting is excellent, especially for a production deemed \u201coff\nWest End\u201d, outside the mainstream but\nnot quite fringe theatre. Will Beer as\nMacbeth brings a power to the stage\nthat is tempered by a particularly unhinged and disturbing Lady Macbeth\n(Jody Watson). The supporting cast is\nalso strong: Jack Bence as Malcolm is\nconvincing in his theatrical debut, possessing a stature that belies his youthful appearance.\nThe adaptation should be commended for its novel staging. The group I\nwas with was seated at a table in the\ncentre of the stage. Before the play\nstarted in earnest we were joined at\nour table by the characters of Malcolm\nand Duncan. There was a distinct air\nof intimidation as they gazed upon us\nand I was immediately drawn into an\nentertaining two hours of \u201cbetrays in\ndeepest consequence\u201d.\nThe stage was used to excellent effect\nas verbal volleys ricocheted around us.\nWe were never more than a matter of\nfeet from the action and as the story\ndeveloped and the daggers were drawn\nI became increasingly concerned with\nwhat was happening around me. The\nactors interacted with us on occasion,\noffering us a bowl of crisps during one\ncelebratory scene. The net effect of this\ninnovative staging is that I actually felt\nI was part of the performance. I was\nthe metaphorical \u201cfly on the wall\u201d as\nMacbeth delivered the infamous line\n\u201cis this a dagger which I see before me\u201d,\ngrasping at an apparition next to my\ndrink.\nInstead of three witches, who usually\ntell the prophecies that lead Macbeth\nto his doom, there are two musicians.\nIt is an interesting choice by the director to move away from tradition and\nuse live music in place of three hags.\nHowever I believe it works well and is\nmore in keeping with the setting; they\nframe scenes nicely and provided a\ndramatic soundtrack to events.\nI would highly recommend heading\ndown to Hammersmith to witness a\nvery engaging adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s play. The fact that it is cheaper\nto buy tickets to sit on the stage than\nin the actual audience should be all the\nmotivation you need to become part\nof the action after your exams. I\u2019ll be\nlooking out for future performances\nby this group; after the play, one cast\nmember described their forthcoming\nproduction of Sophocles\u2019 Ajax as \u201c80\nminutes of death and destruction\u201d. If it\nis anything as involving and provoking\nas their present work it should be another great night out.\nUntil 23 July 2009\n\n"

The source of all this\nmerriment? A rather unusual experiment that Dr Ross, a primatologist\nfrom the University of Portsmouth,\nconducted recently \u2013 tickling baby\napes to see if they laugh. The answer, it\nturns out, is yes; they do. Humans have\noften thought that laughter made us\nspecial, but the joke\u2019s on us \u2013 laughter\nis not just a human thing.\nAs well as finding out that great\napes do laugh, Dr Ross listened to the\nsounds they make. She compared the\nnoises made by tickled baby chimps,\norang-utans, bonobos, gorillas and\nhumans, and mapped the results onto\nan \u2018evolutionary tree\u2019 of laughter. The\ntree shows that our closest laughing-cousins are bonobos and chimpanzees\n\u2013 which given the sounds they make,\nmay or may not be a good thing!\nDr Ross explains that several previous studies \u201chave indicated that laughter is deeply rooted in human biology\u201d,\nso she expected to find something\nwhen she tickled the apes, but \u201cthe\nacoustic findings\u2026 were unexpected\u201d.\nNo one thought apes might laugh like\nus. But does this similarity matter?\nThe Danish humorist Victor Borge\nonce said that \u201cLaughter is the shortest\ndistance between two people.\u201d If apes\nAbigail Orr\nAlthough very well-documented, the\n\u2018Focus\u2019 on green energies issued in the\nlast I, Science does forget the most effi-cient, cheapest and \u201cgreenest\u201d energy:\nthe one we do not consume.\nLately, global measures have shown\nthat climate change amplitude widely\nand systematically overpasses the scenarios simulated a few years ago. Since\nthe beginning of the year, climatologists and personalities (Al Gore, Nicolas Stern...) warn that the increase in\nglobal temperature is very likely to be\naround +2C in 2050 while all the policies and negotiations aim to reach +2C\nno sooner than 2100.\nThis issue is capital for the Copenhagen Summit in December (where\nall the nations will set the post-Kyoto\nrules for the next decades).\nConsequences are countless and\npriceless: millions or billions of dead\ncaused by flooding, droughts, storms,\nlack of water and food, animal and\nvegetal disparition or proliferation...\nresulting in massive migrations, dicta-torships, wars... and it starts within the\nnext few decades. We are not exempted \u2013 democracy, for example, may\nGreen energies: hopes, reality and journalism\nflicker. This is the story of our lives and\nthe only question is how bad it will be.\nIn order to cope with it, \u201cgreen energies\u201d are of course needed, they must\nplay a major role and great efforts must\nbe put towards them. The I, Science report gives a whole range of interesting\nprojects and it shows that a lot is possible to do.\nFor us, engineers and scientists,\nthese projects are all very exciting, they\noffer a large place to technology and\nsome are somehow the \u201cflying cars\u201d of\nour generation. But, we have to keep\nin mind the objective: reducing our\nimpact on the environment as quickly\nand deeply as possible. Each year, each\nmonth, each day is precious to curve\nthe global warming and attenuate its\nfuture repercussions.\nWaiting five or ten years for (hypo-thetical) revolutionary energies is too\nlong; 80% of world\u2019s electricity comes\nfrom coal and it will take years to\nswitch from fossil to renewable energies once we got them. We don\u2019t have\nthat time.\nMoreover, until now every single\ntechnological progress has been used\nto consume more in the end: our engines get a few percent more efficient\neach year but we drive heavier cars\nfarther and faster; we get miniaturised\nelectronics but bigger phones with\nmore functions. It is really unfortunate\nbut this cannot hold, and it must be\nsaid.\nAs scientists, it is our duty to explain to the world the dangers of global\nwarming and the possible solutions.\nAnd scientific journalists have to lead\nthis movement. It would not be honest to imply that energy from waves\nwill save us. It will if we learn how to\ndrive the same distance, or less, with\nour more efficient cars. It will if it is a\nway to reduce the overall CO2 emis-sions, not just the CO2 per kilome-tre. Besides, cutting our emissions by\n10% by changing some behaviours and\ncustoms would be infinitely easier and\nmore efficient than doing so by waiting\nfor renewable sources. We should always remember that every little green\nWatt is the consequence of years and\nmillions spent in research.\nIn articles like the one issued in I,\nScience, the MWs produced by some\nwind or tidal turbines should always\nbe compared to the 16,000,000 MW,\nexponentially increasing, consumed in\nthe world each second.\nTechnology will not provide a miracle solution on its own. It is a gloomy\nmathematical fact and it is a lie to suggest such a thing. Science will help but\nnow the issue is political (how do we\nlive our lives). This is why Copenhagen\nSummit in December is probably one\nof the key events of this century, be\naware of what is decided there.\nGreen energies are a bright hope for\nmankind but waiting for them we must\ncut consumption. And we, engineers\nand scientists, must say it loud to the\nworld.\nDoes their laughter actually mean anything, or is it just monkey\nbusiness?\ncan laugh too, does that shorten the\ndistance between us and them?\nDr Ross describes \u201cthe tickling play\nwith the apes\u201d as \u201cnot all that different than tickling play with a child.\u201d We\nknow that children enjoy being tickled,\nand this seems to suggest that apes enjoy it too. This isn\u2019t the first research to\nshow that apes and humans have simi-larities: previous research has shown\nthat apes can recognise themselves in a\nmirror and even learn simple sign lan-guage. Perhaps they are more human\nthan we realised.\nThese similarities lead some people\nto ask questions about whether apes\ndeserve some of the same rights as\nus\u2026 Dr Ross certainly thinks that apes\nshould have rights. \u201cApes seem to have\nvarious emotions humans have,\u201d she\nsays, \u201cwhy should they not have the\nright to life and freedom from torture?\u201d\nWhether apes deserve rights has\nbeen tickling our consciences for some\ntime now. For example, in the UK it has\nbeen made illegal to use great apes in\nanimal experiments, and Spain looks\nset to grant them the rights to life and\nliberty soon. Many scientists and philosophers are in support of this move-ment, including Richard Dawkins and\nPeter Singer, who are involved in the\nGreat Ape Project. This is a group\nwhich campaigns to extend some human rights to great apes.\nThe philosopher Roger Scruton,\nhowever, is opposed. He doesn\u2019t think\nthat ape laughter means anything.\n\u201cWhen you are tickled you laugh,\nbut not about something, and the\norang-utan being tickled is not in fact\namused,\u201d he states. Roger Scruton is\nResearch Professor at the Institute for\nthe Psychological Sciences and has\nwritten a book entitled Animal Rights\nand Wrongs. He accuses the animal\nrights crowd of anthropomorphising\nanimals. \u201cYou can trace back a lot of\nthings to points on the evolutionary\ntree where we branched one way, and\nother species another,\u201d he continues.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t entitle you to describe\nthe mental and moral capacities of\nthose other species in the terms you\nwould use to describe us.\u201d\nHe has written against animal rights\nbefore, and this latest research has not\naffected his opinion. Yes, some animals\nmay laugh when tickled, but \u201cthe principal point is whether other animals\nare capable of sorting out their relations by means of the concepts of right\nand obligation, as we do. If not, what\ndoes that mean?\u201d he asks.\nThe question is an interesting one.\nThe more we find out about the great\napes, the more we seem to find ourselves reflected in them, but is it all\njust a mirage? Dr Ross admits that this\nresearch doesn\u2019t mean that apes have\na sense of humour, and we have no\nidea what is really going through their\nminds. But then, do we ever know what\nis going through someone else\u2019s mind?\nThe government has a long-term goal\nto reduce carbon emissions by 80\nper cent by 2050. Homes account for\naround 27 per cent of the UK\u2019s carbon\nemissions, and around 10 per cent of\nglobal CO2 emissions are from the\ncement industry. It is clear that if we\nwant to come anywhere near the tar-get, we need to change the way we\nbuild our homes.\nAt present most UK homes are built\nfrom cement but we may soon see\na revival of a green ancient building\ntechnique that could help us reach the\n2050 target, thanks to recent research\nfrom Durham University. Parts of the\nGreat Wall of China and the Alhambra\nat Granada in Spain were built using\nrammed earth, which is long-lasting\nand sustainable. Rammed earth is a\nmanufactured material made up of\nsand, gravel and clay which is moistened and then compacted between\nforms to build walls. The Durham researchers have discovered that it is the\nmoisture that gives rammed earth its\nstrength and longevity. The rammed\nearth technique is already championed\nby a small number of specialist constructors in the UK, including Rowland Keable from Ram Cast CIC, who\nhas over 20 years experience building\nrammed earth structures across Africa\nand the UK. It is hoped that the Durham findings will help the technique\nto become a more mainstream building method.\nThe team that made the discovery is\nheaded by Dr Charles Augarde, who\nsays: \u201cWe know that rammed earth can\nstand the test of time but the source of\nits strength has not been understood\nproperly to date.\u201d The scientists found\nthat the strength of rammed earth\nwas, at least in part, due to the small\namount of water present. If the water\ncontent in the earth is low, suction is\ncreated between soil particles.\nThe work could have implications\nfor the future design of buildings using rammed earth as the link between\nstrength and water content becomes\nclearer. This is good news for the\nrammed earth community who can\nnow look to develop what Dr Augarde calls a \u201crecipe\u201d for constructing\nstrong buildings based on a suitable\nratio of earth to water. \u201cOur next job\nis to devise a way of writing down the\nrules.\u201d With simple rules, perhaps the\nrammed earth method will be taken up\nby mainstream building companies.\nRowland Keable explains that\nrammed earth has a number of green\ncredentials. It\u2019s cheap and sustainable,\nmaterials can be sourced locally and,\nunlike cement, its construction does\nnot give off CO2 emissions. Dr Augarde mentions another benefit: \u201cWith\nrammed earth buildings, the walls act\nas sinks of heat. On a hot day they absorb heat and in the cool evenings they\nrelease it back into the building.\u201d This\nis useful because \u201cpeople won\u2019t need\nair conditioning.\u201d\nSo, will the rammed earth take off\nin Britain? Keable hopes it might: \u201cA\nlot more people in the industry have\nnow heard of the term. 10 years ago,\nno-one had even heard of it. Interest is\ngrowing but everything takes time.\u201d Dr\nAugarde is more reserved: \u201cBuilders\ndon\u2019t have a great deal of confidence\nin the method. It is a viable method.\nThe trouble is the current uncertainty\nabout its long-term behaviour.\u201d He believes that we will see rammed earth\nbecoming more common as a building\ntechnique in the \u201cnext 10 to 15 years\u201d.\nKeable sums up the situation nicely: \u201cI\nthink that there is a normal bell curve\nof acceptability. At the start of the\ncurve there are us nutters, then there\u2019s\na wave of early adopters. The backside\nof the bell are the normal, conservative\npeople and at the back-end are those\nwho will have a brick house come what\nmay.\u201d\nBut is it the low cost or the green\ncredentials that will ultimately sell\nrammed earth to the public and the\nbuilding industry? Dr Augarde goes\nfor green: \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s the green\nbox they\u2019re ticking. Big companies are\nthinking about it.\u201d Keable agrees: \u201c10\nyears ago, if you mentioned climate\nchange you\u2019d be given a sceptical look.\nNow, there\u2019s not even a question about\nits importance.\u201d\nThat is good news for our climate\nand good news for the government\ntoo.\nLouisa Garnier\nRevival of an ancient building technique\ncould help save our planet\nThe small island of Principe off the\ncoast of Africa is famous for two\nthings: cocoa plantations, and a scientific revolution. Some people enjoy\nthe chocolate, but the whole world has\nbeen transformed by the revolution.\nIn the summer of 1919 on this small,\nlush, tropical island, Arthur Eddington\ntook photos to back up Einstein\u2019s now\nfamous theory of relativity. The photos of a solar eclipse showed that light\nfrom stars bent towards the sun due\nto the pull of gravity. Eddington\u2019s pictures \u201cpropelled Einstein into the limelight\u201d and made an \u2018inarguable\u2019 impact\non the world we live in, according to\nMarek Kukula. Marek is the public astronomer from the Greenwich Royal\nObservatory where Eddington worked\n100 years ago.\n\u201cThe theory of special relativity is so\nweird and counter-intuitive,\u201d explains\nMarek that, \u201cconcrete evidence for it\nmust have been amazing at the time:\nmind blowing!\u201d In fact, \u201cit still is!\u201d\n90 years on, scientists are still using\ntelescopes to use and test Einstein\u2019s\nlegendary equation, E=MC2. The latest project to do so is the British super-telescope network, \u2018e-MERLIN\u2019. A far\ncry from Eddington\u2019s basic equipment,\nthese radio-telescopes represent a major step forward in \u2018scope sensitivity\u2019.\nAstronomers will be now able to study\nareas of our universe we have not yet\nbeen able to see in detail.\nThe first signals were recently received by e-MERLIN and,\n\u201cWhen e-MERLIN comes fully on\nline later next year,\u201d says Tom Muxlow,\none of the lead scientists in the project,\n\u201cwe intend to be able to trace out the\nbasic star-formation history of the\nUniverse.\u201d\n\u201cThese observations will again test\nEinstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity\u201d he explains, since they hope to detect \u201ccentral images\u201d at the heart of star\nforming galaxies that are \u201cpredicted by\nEinstein\u2019s theory\u201d but with previous\ntechnology, we haven\u2019t been able to\nobserve.\n\u201cWe hope to be able to not only test\nrelativity but also understand more\nabout how the universe began.\u201d\nIf, though, Eddington\u2019s photos provided concrete evidence almost 100\nyears ago, why are scientists still testing the theory?\nAlthough there are internet rumours\nthat Eddington may have fudged his\nresults, the continued observations are\nmainly because many of the weirdest\nconsequences of relativity theory have\nbeen impossible to test with our current technology.\nFor example, the faster you travel,\npredicts Einstein, the shorter you be-come, and the heavier you get. This\nwould mean a 30m, 2000kg bus travelling 99% the speed of light would\ncontract down to just over 4m long\nand weigh an amazing 100503kg. You\nwould never, states the theory, be able\nto travel as fast as light because at that\npoint you would become infinitely\nheavy. Sci-fi writers and theoretical\nphysicists have been trying to get their\nheads, and their storylines, around\nthat for years.\nUnable to create a bus that will travel\nat 99% light speed, scientists like Tom\nTropical islands, Sat Nav and atomic bombs:\nHow stargazing transforms society\nMaria Hogan Muxlow and Marek Kukula have had\nto leave such things to the sci-fi writers and content themselves with making smaller observations like that of\nEddington. They look at the ways that\nstars interact and compare their observations with the predictions made by\nrelativity theory.\nOver the past 90 years, each time\nthere have been new technological\nadvances, scientists have taken the opportunity to both make use of relativity\nand to test it out further. So far it has\npassed each test with flying colours.\nFrom the Apollo moon landings 40\nyears ago to the Hadron collider at\nCERN this year, special relativity has\nbeen foundational to much of modern day science. And, explains Marek,\nwhilst at extremes the theory throws\nout weird and wonderful conclusions,\nour everyday world would be a very\ndifferent place without it.\n\u201cAll our nuclear technology is based\non E=MC2, including the nuclear\npower we use for electricity as well\nas atomic weapons\u201d he highlighted,\n\u201cwhich have not only affected science\nbut also defined much of the politics of\nthe past century\u201d.\n\u201cEven GPS on phones\u201d he says\n\u201cworks by tracking signals from satel-lites. Those satellites are taking into account gravity and staying in orbit using\nE=MC2\u201d\nSo next time you switch on the light,\nwatch a sci-fi film or program a postcode into your sat\u2019 nav\u2019, remember rela-tivity. Don\u2019t forget the story of Principe,\nand Arthur Eddington, the stargazing\nastronomer who provided concrete\nevidence for a counter-intuitive, revolutionary idea. Because, says Marek\nKukula, \u201cwithout Einstein\u2019s theory, this\ntechnology would be impossible.\u201d\nHugo Frederich\nDid the recent I, science\u2019s \u2018Focus\u2019 on green energy miss the point?\nAre mud huts going to become standard buildings in the future?\nIt was a cloudy day in London, but\nDr Dave Clements\u2019 spirits soared as\nhe gazed up at the sky. With the pop\nof a champagne cork, his colleagues\naround him erupted into songs of cel-ebration. Clements and his team from\nImperial College, London, were just\nsome of the scientists around the globe\ncelebrating the launch of two spectacular giant telescopes into space.\nOver the last decade, astrophysicists\nat Imperial College have been planning the launch of two European Space\nAgency telescopes from the other side\nof the pond in French Guiana. The\nImperial team have also developed an\ninstrument known as SPIRE (Spectral\nand Photometric Imaging REceiver)\nto tag along for the ride. SPIRE has\n\u201cessentially very sensitive thermometers working at temperatures only a\nfew tenths of a degree above absolute\nzero\u201d (that\u2019s a rather nippy -273\u00b0C).\n\u201cThese detectors absorb light, heat up\na little, and the temperature change is\nmeasured,\u201d explains Clements. These\nchanges can be used to create an image of space, using filters and other\ninstruments.\nThe telescopes, named after eminent physicists Herschel and Planck,\nare being thrust to a point in space\nalmost a million miles from our own\nplanet. This point, known amongst\nthe scientists as \u201cL2\u201d, is what Clements\ndescribes as a \u201c\u2019balance point\u2019 between the sun and the earth\u2019s gravity,\nso things are more stable at L2 than\nelsewhere.\u201d\nHerschel and\nPlanck: A tale of\ntwo telescopes in\nthe night sky\nJessica Hamzelou Planck, the smaller of the two, will\nbe observing the cosmic microwave\nbackground of the universe (its glow),\nwhat Clements refers to as \u201cthe dull\necho of the Big Bang.\u201d Herschel, the\nbigger of the two, and in fact the largest space telescope ever, will use the\nSPIRE technology to look at cosmic\ninfrared background, the \u201cresult of\nenergy produced by stars and the supermassive black holes\u201d and reprocessed by space dust. This means that\nthe information, when it is beamed\nback down to scientists on Earth, will\nprovide much more information than\nregular optical telescopes. As Clements puts it, \u201coptical telescopes, like\nHubble, only see half the story. That is\nwhy we need instruments like SPIRE\nand telescopes like Herschel, so that\nwe can see the whole story of the uni-verse, not just some fraction biased by\nour dependence on the optical.\u201d\nHerschel and its SPIRE technology\nwill also enable the teams to take a\npeek at \u201cdusty towers\u201d where stars are\nformed. These towers simply don\u2019t\nshow up on the normal optical tel-escopes. Clements is among the hundreds of scientists who hope Herschel\ncan provide a \u201cfull understanding of\nstar formation.\u201d\nFor now, the Imperial team, along\nwith their international colleagues,\nwill have to wait for the snapshots of\nthe universe, which will hopefully provide the missing pieces of the puzzle\nof the birth of our galaxy. The earliest\ninformation is expected in 2010, when\nit may be time for Clements to order in\nsome more champagne!\nIf you look closely, I mean really closely, you will the felix team saying \u201cHi!\u201d\n\n"

Given that\nImperial College has a very strong\nglobal reputation and, year on year, attracts far many more applicants than\nit can accept, these facts naturally lead\nthose who represent the interests of\nImperial College to want to break free\nof the restrictive regulatory framework\n\u2013 that is, to privatise.\nHowever, we are not all agents representing the interests of Imperial College, we are also human beings and we\nshould therefore represent the interests\nof the wider human society in which\nwe live which is, by now, a global one.\nIt is in the context of the wider human society that we should look upon\nthe issue of privatisation of the UK\u2019s\ntop universities, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll try\nto do below.\nA quick look at the Imperial\u2019s \u201cAnnual Report and Accounts 2007-8\u201d\ndocument reveals the large extent to\nwhich Imperial College is reliant on\npublic money (UK or otherwise) for its\nfunding.\nIn 2008, Imperial\u2019s total income was\n\u00a3603.1m, of which \u00a3165.1m came from\nthe Higher Education Funding Council\nfor England (HEFCE) and \u00a386m from\nUK research councils. It is difficult to\nsay how much of the \u00a350.2m contribution from the EU and overseas may\nhave been foreign public money, but\nthe chances are, it is a substantial pro-portion. Those are the \u2018direct\u2019 contributions from the public purse, however\nthere are many mechanisms by which\npublic money will have reached Imperial College indirectly. For example, it\nis well known that many governments\n(the UK government included) are\nmajor customers of military-related\nhigh-technology industry. It is highly\nlikely that such firms have contributed\nsubstantially to the \u00a327m that Imperial received from UK industry, as well\nas from the EU and overseas (the details of which companies contributed\nweren\u2019t published).\nThere are good economic reasons\nwhy such a lot of public money is invested in R&D. In the last century,\neconomic prosperity for the business\nclass in the UK and US has been largely\nbased on hi-tech innovations \u2013 most\nof which were initially developed in\npublicly funded sectors of the economy\nwithin, or closely linked with universi-ties. From semiconductors, to comput-ers, aeroplanes, numerical processing\ntechnologies (on which modern factories are based), container technology\n(on which global trade is based) and\nthe Internet, to name but a few.\nWith this much said, it is clear that\ninstitutions like Imperial College cannot be \u2018privatised\u2019 in the same sense\nthat, say, a state-owned shop can be\nprivatised since it relies critically on\npublic money for its income, whereas\nthe shop can rely on its sales to its\nmany customers for its income. Said\nanother way, governments are monopolistic consumers of the products\nwhich universities provide. Like all\nmonopolistic consumers, they have\nthe power to shape the sort of products\nthat the universities provide (i.e. the\nsort of research that is done), by directing demand.\nThese observation have obvious\nconsequences for the talk about \u2018international competition\u2019 between academic institutions. The competition is\npredominantly for government fund-ing, and governments tend to be loyal\nconsumers of the products of their\nown country\u2019s top academic institu-tions. As a rule of thumb, a university\nwill be \u201ccompetitive\u201d to the extent that\nit receives large funding from its home\ncountry\u2019s government.\nThe issue of privatisation, then, is not\nan issue of control over the sort of research that is done (since governments\nwill continue to largely dictate this),\nbut it is to do with the single issue of\nwhether a university should be allowed\nto charge what it likes for tuition. It\nboils down the question of how to distribute the costs of tuition between the\ngovernment, the individual student,\nand the university. Should the student\nfoot the bill, the government, or Imperial College?\nFirst, however, it\u2019s worth saying\nsomething about what the cost of tuition will be (i.e. how it will be worked\nout) before addressing who should bear\nthis cost. Sir Roy (and Sir Richard before him) often like to point out that a\ndegree from Imperial College is worth\nmuch more than a degree from most\nother UK institutions. Why? It can\u2019t be\nbecause the teaching quality at Imperial is so much better than everywhere\nelse \u2013 university assessments by The\nGuardian, Times etc. show otherwise.\nIn fact, these studies also reveal that\nImperial students are among the least\nhappy in the UK. It\u2019s also unlikely to be\nbecause the resources needed to train a\nstudent at Imperial cost a lot more than\nthey do elsewhere.\nThe determining factor for the cost\nof tuition will be the strength of demand for places at Imperial, and that\nwill be determined by the strength of\nthe Imperial \u2018brand\u2019 globally, relative to\nthe other major academic institutions\nof the world.\nThe rational thing for Sir Roy to do\nif Imperial is privatised is to whack\ntuition fees up to whatever he can get\naway with, given the strength of the\nImperial \u2018brand\u2019 globally.\nLike it or hate it, the cost of tuition\n(which will probably be born in part by\nthe British public and in part by the individual student) will depend, in part,\non the on the success or failure of Imperial College\u2019s continuing global efforts\nto strengthen its brand. That is not to\nsay that the quality of research is not\na factor in the strength of the \u2018brand\u2019.\nObviously, better-funded universities\ntend to produce better research, for a\nvariety of reasons, which contributes\nto brand strength (although it seems\nthat there is a much weaker correlation\nbetween brand strength and teaching\nstandards). If the extra cash injection\nfrom increased tuition fees translates\ninto more scientific publications, and\nthe \u2018brand\u2019 is strengthened, we can be\nsure of further rises in tuition fees \u2013 regardless of the actual cost to Imperial\nCollege per student.\nHow the privatisation of Imperial\nwill effect British society will depend\non how the \u2018burden\u2019 of tuition fees is\nspread. Currently, Imperial College is\nat a disadvantage with respect to its\nIvy League competitors in the US, who\ncan set their own fees. A far more significant disadvantage, however, is that\nUS government expenditure in R&D is\nfar greater than here, not only because\nthey spend a higher percentage of their\nGDP on R&D, but also because their\nGDP per capita is higher than the UK\u2019s.\nFundamentally, the choice is between\nwhether: (1) universities in the UK stay\nwith their current levels of funding i.e.\nno change; (2) the government pays the\ncosts of better funding for universities;\n(3) the individual students pay far more\nthan they currently do. Or some mixture of the three \u2013 no doubt, via some\ncomplicated loan/grant/reimburse-ment scheme which governments specialise in.\nOf course, if funding stays as it is, we\ncan be fairly sure that UK\u2019s universities will continue to produce at current\nlevels. If the student pays the costs of\ntuition, then the output of the top universities should increase because of\nincreased funding, but a highly inequitable system will have been created,\nin which only the rich will be able to\nafford to be educated at the top univer-sities. Finally if the government bares\nthe costs, then social mobility will\nprobably increase, society will become\nmore equitable and university output\nwill increase, but at a cost to the tax-payer. Who is effected most by the tax\nburden will depend on how progressive\nor regressive the tax system is. So on\nthe face of it, it seems sensible for the\ngovernment to use its power to ensure\nan increase in our total university output in an equitable way, by increasing\nR&D spending \u2013 which would benefit\nall universities, not just the top 5, and\nwould be a force pushing towards a\nmore equitable society, provided the\nUK maintains (and enforces) a relatively non-regressive tax system where\nthe wealthy take on a larger share of the\nburden.\nSir Roy wouldn\u2019t be fulfilling his institutional role, if he didn\u2019t pursue a\npolicy of economic imperialism on\nbehalf of Imperial College. The gov-ernment, however, is responsible for\nthe wider health of the system of universities and the interests of the British\npeople so, accordingly, should resist Sir\nRoy\u2019s imperialist desires for privatisa-tion, whilst increasing funding for UK\nuniversities across the board \u2013 if an increase is what the British people decide\nis in their interest. If, however, the government decides \u2013 as it is expected to\n\u2013 to reduce funding for R&D in the UK\nover the next few years (without any\npublic consultation), it isn\u2019t surprising\nthat Sir Roy should rant and rave about\nprivatisation.\nUniversity funding and privatising Imperial\n\u201cThe rational\nthing for Sir Roy\nto do if Imperial\nis privatised is\nto whack tuition\nfees up to\nwhatever he can\nget away with\u201d\nimperialcollegeunion.org/ball\nSummer Ball 2009\nImperial College London\nSaturday 20 June\nCABARET STAGE\n(THE DOCTOR & THE PENCIL)\nTHE GLOBE GIRLS JAZZ BIG BAND\nNOEL FIELDING & DAVE BROWN\n\u00a340\nENTERTAINMENTS\n\u00a375\nDINNER\nLIVE ARENA\nATHLETE\nROSIE & THE GOLDBUG TAPE THE RADIO\nBATTLE OF THE BANDS WINNER\nJEFF AUTOMATIC CLUB NME\nALSO...\nDANCE VENUE\nPENDULUM\nCHASE & STATUS FEAT MC RAGE\n(EL HORNET DJ SET) FEAT MC JAKES\nINTERLOPE (LIVE)\nKILLA KELA SCRATCH PERVERTS\n\u2022 FUN FAIR\n\u2022 BIG WHEEL\n\u2022 DODGEMS\n\u2022 AMAZING LIGHT SHOWS\n\u2022 3D PROJECTIONS\n\u2022 FOOD VANS\n\u2022 WANDERING ACTS\n\u2022 FIREWORKS\n\u2022 SURVIVORS\u2019 PHOTO\n\u2022 TONI & GUY HAIR SALON\n\u2022 PROFESSIONAL\nPHOTOGRAPHER\nF\nF\nF\nFE\nE\nF\nF\nFE\nE\n8 DAYS TO GO!\n\n"

There\u2019s the lonely, sloppy\nyet brilliant investigative journalist\n(Russell Crowe). There\u2019s the morally\ncorrupt politician (Jeff Daniels) and\nthe young one full of ideals (Ben Affleck) working hard to fight a big, bad\ncorporation.\nWe also need: a woman collegue and\nassistant for the journalist (Rachel McAdams), a tough editor with a weak\nspot for the main character (Helen\nMirren), a love affair, a few seemingly\nunconnected murders, and of course\nthe huge and powerful company out\nto protect its secret. On the aesthetic\nside, you won\u2019t be surprised to hear\nthe film is set in Washington or that,\ncuriously, the characters seem to move\naround the city only at night when the\nJournalism rarely gets as thrilling as Crowe makes it look.\nappropriate feeling of suspense and\ndisquietude creates itself.\nDespite there not being any considerable twists on the usual formula, the\nmovie is very \u2018watchable\u2019. Unless someone is a very strict disbeliever in any\nsort of conspiracy theories and the like,\nyou shouldn\u2019t find any of the events de-Hanks looking smug and Zurer looking hot \u2013 check; Ewan McGregor looking ridiculous in a cassock \u2013 check.\nScience and Religion battle it out...\nAngels and Demons HHHKK\nDirector: Ron Howard\nWriter: David Koepp\nAkiva Goldsman\nCast: Tom Hanks,\nEwan McGregor,\nAyelet Zurer\nBased on the controversial Dan Brown\nnovel of the same name, Angels and\nDemons shocks on many levels: the science is complete and utter rubbish and\nso are the religious aspects. But even\nwhen you take the hackneyed plot and\nextremely predictable \u2018twist\u2019 at the end\ninto account, I was quite shocked by the\nfact I liked the film, especially when I really did not like its predecessor The Da\nVinci Code.\nThe premise of the film involves scientists working in Geneva on the CERN\nparticle accelerator who finally create\n\u2018anti-matter\u2019, which is then stolen by\nsomeone to be weaponised and used as a\nbomb to blow up the Vatican. Cryptologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is on the\ncase, tracking the secret society that is\npresumed to be responsible for threatening the Church and kidnapping some\nof its members. Will he be able to hunt\ndown the person doing this before it is\ntoo late?\nNot having read the book before reviewing the film, the plot is a very interesting and exciting one, leading us\nquickly around Rome in order for Robert\nLangdon and his sexy sidekick (Golds-man) to decipher clues and save the day.\nAlthough just a cryptologist, it seems\nthat Langdon can do everything and\nanything, and this time round we don\u2019t\nhave to stare at his horrible wig which\nwas very off putting in the first film.\nLangdon gets into all kinds of scrapes,\nbeing trapped, shot at and almost killed,\nand this is the part of the film that is fast\nflowing and fun. Although about half an\nhour too long (the film\u2019s running time\ncomes in at an uncomfortable two and a\nhalf hours!) it just about keeps itself interesting until the very end.\nIn terms of acting, Hanks seems disinterested \u2013 with his big fat pay check he\ndoesn\u2019t need to try. His beautiful assistant is almost on a par with a Bond girl,\nonly providing some sexy eye candy.\nMcGregor is entertaining and over the\ntop as a priest, but I think his performance suits the cheesy tone of the film.\nEveryone else plays their stereotypical\none dimension characters well \u2013 almost\npantomime-like with the audience jeering or cheering when certain characters\nappear on screen.\nBoth scientists and theologists will\nlaugh out loud at some of the hideous\ninaccuracies. I\u2019m no physicist, but I don\u2019t\nthink it is scientifically accurate in any\nway. But saying that, once we enter the\nVatican, none of the theology seems to\nbe accurate either, demonising Catholics\nand making up things about the Church\nthat I\u2019m sure are not true in a very X-Files\nway.\nIt\u2019s all a conspiracy! The Church is evil!\nThey cover up everything! But the film\ntries to play a very delicate balancing act,\neither by annoying both groups of peo-ple, or appeasing them as both science\nand religion are vilified and then subsequently redeemed.\nTaking into account that this film is a\n12A, I was quite shocked at some of the\nlevels of violence and disturbing im-agery. Rats eat dead bodies, eyeballs are\nripped out, people are set alight whilst\nalive and throats are slit \u2013 is this really\nchild- friendly material? Well it doesn\u2019t\nmatter anyway, as I assume that 100%\nof the student population of Imperial\nare over 18, unless we have an 8 year-old\nchild prodigy skulking around campus\nsomewhere. But my point is that the film\nwas much more grisly then I anticipated,\nwhich I think added an extra dimension\nof suspense and surprise.\nSince the Vatican was not allowed to\nbe used as a set, the interior shots are\nvery obvious CGI that does detract from\nthe film. It looks like they are walking\nin front of a blue screen, and this makes\nyou think about the fact the Church did\nnot allow the film-makers to shoot the\ninteriors.\nScience vs. Religion, an idea instilled\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nState of Play HHHKK\nDirector: Kevin MacDonald\nWriter: Matthew Carnahan\net al\nCast: Russell Crowe,\nBen Affleck,\nRachel McAdams\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nin us as soon as we enter the education\nsystem. Can\u2019t they just get along?\nThe whole premise of the film pits the\ntwo head-to-head against each other,\neven the title unsubtly refers to the underlying idea of who are the \u2018angels\u2019 and\nwho are the \u2018demons\u2019. As a science uni-versity, Imperial students must wrestle\nwith this argument every day, as there\nare many strong Christian Unions on\ncampus, something that surprised me\nwhen I first arrived at Imperial. Can the\ntwo live happily together?\nThe film tries to answer this with a\nslightly skewed agenda (science comes\nout much better), but to appease the\nAmerican audience, the scriptwriters\npicted as impossible or unreal. Rather\nthan trying to impress the viewer with\na confusing and overembroiled plot,\nKevin Macdonald, the director who\nbrought us such diverse movies as The\nLast King of Scotland and Touching\nthe Void, makes the right decision to\nkeep the film simple (as simple as the\ngenre allows it, that is) and concentrate\non the details.\nThus State of Play is very well edit-ted, with clever pacing that builds up\nto a surprising, yet slightly anticli-mactic, finale where the truth comes\nout. With a decent cast, the director\nmanages to evoke solid and believable\nperformances from all but Ben Affleck\nwho remains as convincing as your\nnephew in the primary school play\nbut with considerably less charm and\nnone of the \u2018cute factor\u2019 (this reviewer should probably mention her deep\nprejudice against Affleck at this point).\nRussell Crowe stands out as the truth\n-seeking journalist, and his understated way of acting keeps Cal (the character he plays) on the level of normal\nhuman beings and not superhuman,\nsuper-ethical heroes found elswhere in\nthe movie industry.\nMacdonald also opts out of unnecessary moralising, thus saving the film\nfrom becoming too cheesy. All in all,\nI\u2019d have to say that although there\u2019s not\na lot in the movie that I can criticise,\nyou shouldn\u2019t worry about missing\nState of Play in the cinemas. Watching\nit on DVD will mean that Crowe\u2019s new\nchubby face won\u2019t be a metre wide.\nThere\u2019s no mention of the Student\nUnion safety issues, shitty catering or\nHumanities courses cuts, but it\u2019s still\ninteresting.\n\u2018I tell you, the Earth is flat!\u2019 ... \u2018Come on, stop yanking my chain\u2019\nA Retraction\nfilm felix would like to apologise\nfor a mistake printed in the May\n29th edition of felix. In a caption\nunderneath a picture of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, we said that he\nhad \u2018steel\u2019 claws. We then received\nan email from \u2018Mister Sinister\u2019 who\nwrote the following:\n\u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge that Wolverine\u2019s skeleton is Adamantium,\nand that it is not an element of the\nperiodic table but composed of iron-related compounds put together via\na secret process, discovered by the\nAmerican metallurgist Dr. Myron\nMacLain.\n\u201d\nTo everyone in the comic book\ncommunity, and to Mister Sinister\nhimself, we are very sorry for this\nterrible mix up, and we apologise\nif this caused any severe distress\nor harm to anyone. We would like\neveryone to know that Wolverine\nhas Adamantium claws, not steel,\nand we hope that by knowing this\nfact, we have enriched your lives\nand rectified a terrible wrong. We\nalso promise to spend more time on\nresearching the movie before writing new photo captions.\nYours,\nFilm Felix\ndo try their best to please the religious\naudience members by adding some saving grace to at least one of the Catholic\ncharacters. I think it would be silly for\nanyone to think that this plot was not\nwritten just to be sensationalist, as the\nChurch conspiracy could be replaced by\na government conspiracy or something\nsimilar with such ease that the archetypal characters would slot into a different\nsetting without anyone noticing.\nAll in all, the film\u2019s ideas, both scientific and theological, are crap. But it is\nstill enjoyable crap, and as long as you\nknow that, then you can just sit back and\nenjoy the fun and exciting ride, with Tom\nHanks placed firmly in the driving seat.\n22 felix Friday 12 June 2009\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Dan Wan & Kawai Wong\nMother of all trousers\u2013 men\nSo long...

I was in a black mini-dress, military heels, a pair\nof ripped tight and a flaming\nred 80\u2019s jacket.

Besides, it was\neither that, or reams upon reams of revision hidden away in my room like an\nascetic with agoraphobia.\nEven though I was only with the\nfamed naturalist for a few seconds,\nI was suitably impressed. Dressed\nsmartly in a cream jacket, he warmly\nasked me how I was as he opened my\ncopy of his autobiography (Life on\nAir, available in all good bookstores).\nDressed in a Hawaiian shirt of questionable taste, I don\u2019t think I quite expressed the same level of eloquence.\nI guess I was just awestruck; this was\nthe voice who had unveiled the natural world to me, who had slaked my\ncuriosity and stoked my interest in\nnature and all things green. I suppose,\nin a round-about way, he is one of the\nreasons I am at Imperial today. Pen\ndown, he handed his book back to me.\nI thanked him and walked off with an\nair of particular gormlessness.\nAs fascinating albeit brief encounter\nas that was, it is but the springboard to\nmy main topic this week. Before I even\ngot to meet Dave (I like to think we\u2019re\non first name terms now \u2013 even though\nhe dedicated the book to Gerald), I had\nto wait in line for a good hour or so.\nBut this gave me the perfect chance to\nparticipate in that great British past-time, the Queue.\nThe Queue is ubiquitous in modern\nsociety. Where there are people, there\nwill certainly be queues; this is truth.\nBe it pale and spotty video-gamers\nwaiting outside the electronics store in\nthe dead of night for the latest console\nrelease, or the unemployed queueing\nup outside the job centre, or the poorest of the poor in the third world waiting expectantly as aid is delivered and\ndistributed, there is no one who does\nnot know the experience that is the\nqueue.\nAnd it has its own rules and eti-quette, not all of which are necessarily\nobeyed, but quietly respected in their\nown way. Consider, you have to stand\nin a line, surrounded by strangers on\neither side, all for the same common\ngoal. Normally, we are distrustful crea-tures, casting suspicious glances at\nanyone within a three metre radius.\nBut line us up in a queue and everything changes. Even though our personal space shrinks down to zero, we\nbecome amiable, even affable.\nNow, I will admit, the weather was\nfavourable to me for once. I got to bask\nin the warm glow of late afternoon\nsunshine, proper summer weather.\nIt would have been perfect if I hadn\u2019t\nbeen missing the Pimms. What\u2019s more,\nthis was the first time I had been out\nof the halls in days. After the pains of\nimmunoglobulins, anastomoses and\npseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, I\nwas glad to be reminded what fresh (by\nLondon\u2019s standards) air smelt like.\nBut even if it had been raining, lashing it down in biblical proportions, I\nargue it would still have been a jolly\nold time. I recall childhood trips to\nDisneyland Paris, queueing for Space\nMountain in a continental downpour,\nprotected by only a sheet of plastic\nwith Mickey Mouse emblazoned on\nthe back. Ah, plastic anoraks.\nIn spite of the weather, or perhaps\neven because of it, my family and I\nwould strike up conversation with our\nneighbours in the line. With nothing\nelse to do, without even the weather to enjoy, we talked, we joked, we\nlaughed...we realised we didn\u2019t speak\nGerman and they didn\u2019t speak English,\nbut we had a good time. It is in the\nqueue that we can branch out and connect with other people. Friendships are\nmade, bonds are formed and I think\nperhaps humanity has its good points\nafter all.\nMaybe it was the beautiful weather\nbuoying our spirits but there was a\nconvivial atmosphere in that line. I\nsaw old men, out in their socks and\nsandals, standing next to mere boys,\nstill dressed in their school blazers. I\nsaw businessmen, I saw students; all\nof them deeply engaged in the opening\nchapters of Sir David\u2019s autobiography.\nThey say London is the great melting\npot of peoples, cultures, ideas. I put\nthis down to the power of the Queue.\nWaiting for a bus. Standing on an Underground station platform. Queueing\nfor a gig of some shape or form. Does\nany other city force us to wait as much\nas London? But it is a good thing that\nit does. In our hectic, busy lives, when\nwe are all in a rush, a queue forces us to\nstop, wait, and have patience. Instead\nof neurotic balls of rage and anxiety, we\ncan take a deep breath, take a look at\nthose around us, and realise that we\u2019re\nhuman. To be human is to wait, to wait\nis to have hope. Hope that the Piccadilly line is running on time.\n...but if you cut in front of me, I swear\nI\u2019ll shank your ass!\nRhys Davies hates queues, but he did meet Dave!\n\u201cThe Queue is\nubiquitous in\nmodern society.\nWhere there are\npeople, there\nwill certainly be\nqueues; this is\ntruth\u201d\nSanjay Choolun just can\u2019t seem to get to sleep\nI\nt\u2019s 5.41am. I\u2019ve tried reading a\nfew chapters of a textbook, limply shuffled a few things around\non my desk and have gone to the\nbathroom just for the trip. This\nwould be pretty unusual behaviour if it\nwasn\u2019t the sixth night in a row.\nMy problem, as you may have already guessed, is insomnia. My reason\nis exam-related stress.\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not one\nof those kids who\u2019s aced every single\ntest since nursery and then throws a\nself-pitying fit whenever any form of\nassessment comes their way. Nor am I\nnot fond of sleep. I love sleep. Ask anyone where I am before noon on a weekday and it would be a safe bet it\u2019s under\nthe covers catching some shuteye. Too\nbad all that time in bed and not enough\nin lectures is coming round to bite me\nin the ass.\nWhat happens is this: as soon as I\nlie down, my mind starts to whirr. \u201cIf\nI was up I could read another section\u201d,\nor, \u201cI still have a Lab report\u201d, and more\nleisurely, \u201cI need to sort out my holiday plans ASAP\u201d... If I let it carry on I\nfeel my throat starting to close. I toss\nand turn and think of Zen but nothing clears my mind. At best I can get\nan hour of sleep before I awake with a\nstart. Somehow I don\u2019t think counting\nsheep is the answer.\nInevitably I decide to get up, take a\nshower and begin my day. And do you\nknow what the kicker is? By 10am I am\ncompletely dead to the world and faced\nwith a new dilemma: do I sleep now\nand risk not sleeping at night, or do I\ntry my best to endure extreme sleep\ndeprivation? I believe the answer is un-important, you\u2019re screwed both ways.\nI\u2019m sure you, dear reader, know the\nbenefits of good sleep. It rejuvenates\nyour body and mind, giving you energy\nand improving mental focus. According to those science-y types, is also vital to a healthy immune system. Ah, so\nthat explains my constant headaches,\nsore throats and poor sexual perform-ance. Well, I hope so.\nBut how can such a laid-back, care-free, all-around-Cool-Dude like me get\nsomething as pussy as anxiety? Personally, I put it down to the \u201cYou\u2019re Fucked\nNow\u201d lecture a month ago, where they\nwere keen to emphasise that 40% or\nless and at best it ruins your summer,\nat worse it ruins your degree. This is\nincluding scaling of results, a departmental policy against all forms of answers or mark schemes and a record\nsized year group that is prime for some\nDarwinistic pruning. So no pressure\nthen.\nSadly enough, after speaking to a few\ncompadres, it seems I am not the only\none going through this. The best any of\nus can hope for is to suck up enough\nknowledge come exam time and then\nhopefully fall into a still, soothing\nslumber. It makes me wonder just how\nmany people are essentially failed by a\nlack of support system and aggressive\neducation policies. Are you up in the\nwee hours reading this article right\nnow? Is your bed lying sullen and unused like the Sherfield oriental buffet?\nAre you looking at a pile of textbooks\nand getting angry at the bullshit that\nlies ahead of you?\nDon\u2019t worry about it, friend. My advice to you? Sleep on it.\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of felix\nI\nt\u2019s the last year of my degree,\nmy exams are over and I\u2019m\none month away from severing all contact with what most\npeople would call an alma\nmater, but I prefer to think of as my\nmater horribilis. That would be a bit\nof a shame, I thought, so I thought\nI\u2019d leave a record for posterity. Give\nsomething back to the birthplace\nof my learning. Provide a tender,\nguiding and increasingly disturbing\nhand for young freshers just like me,\nwhen I had my honour, when I had\nmy dreams, and before I learnt the\nalternative use of hall of residence\nsinks. What would that be? It\u2019s the\nReal Rules of Imperial!\nReal Rules?

Two months later, you\nfind out you failed.\n\u2022 Everybody loves an Asian girl. All\nright, it\u2019s IC and we have to be numerical about everything.

Seriously. Just\nlook at how in last week\u2019s\ncomment article \u2013 \u201cLove\nversus atheism?\u201d \u2013 she\nconsiders the problem of how atheists can account for love. See how she\nconsiders the atheist view of love? Notice how she doesn\u2019t label atheists with\nnegative words like \u201chardcore\u201d and\n\u201cnihilistic\u201d? Marvel at how she doesn\u2019t\nwrite off the view that love is down to\nsome biological mechanism as a \u201cdisBarnaby Walker:\nCaz Knight versus\nopen-minds?\nThe Real Rules of Imperial by BARELOLS\nI\nam an atheist, and yet I feel love.\nI care about my friends and my\nfamily, I feel happy when they\u2019re\nhappy and sad when they\u2019re\nsad. However, according to Caz\nKnight\u2019s last week article, I shouldn\u2019t.\nApparently, not believing in a deity\ngives me no purpose in anything and\ndoesn\u2019t allow me to even get up in the\nmorning, because I am a soulless man\nwhose only aim is to produce offspring.\nI think Caz Knight confuses evolution with atheism. The two are separate\ntheories in separate fields of human\nknowledge. Those who don\u2019t believe\nin God don\u2019t shape their lives to follow the principles of evolution. Rather,\nthey decide to live in a world free of supernatural elements where choices are\ndictated by reason and critical thinking\nrather than superstition and dogma.\nAtheism does not give a goal, or an aim\nto life. It is simply a way of approaching the world and the others that tries\nto be as fair and free from prejudice as\npossible. In no way is evolution linked\nto this. A scientific theory tries to explain the world; it does not aim to be\na guide like a philosophic thought\nwould. Equating the two shows great\nconfusion about what atheists really\nbelieve in, and render any conclusions\ndrawn from this rather useless.\nUnder a certain point of view, love is\na very evolutionary idea: caring for our\nmates strengthens us and the commu-nity, increasing the chances of viable\noffspring to perpetuate the species;\nhowever that is not the point. There\nare a lot of things on how our brain\nworks that we do not know, but this\ndoes not mean that we cannot obtain\ncomplete knowledge without resorting to the supernatural. Hormones and\nother biochemical explanations reveal\npart of the picture, and imputing the\nunknowns to religion and God is a lazy\nand closed-minded way to settle the is-sue. Or, alternatively, it is an overzealous and pointless exercise of finding a\nmeaning where none is. Like Douglas\nAdams said, isn\u2019t it enough to see that\na garden is beautiful without having to\nbelieve that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? Why can\u2019t you enjoy love\nwithout having to think that it\u2019s part of\nsomething profound and special? Isn\u2019t\nthe pleasure that you get from being\nwith people you care about enough for\nyou? Why do you have to try to graft\nonto it something else, with the poor\nexcuse that it would prove the existence of God?\nI don\u2019t need a \u201cpurpose\u201d to drive me\nwhen I wake up in the morning. There\u2019s\nno master plan, visible or invisible, that\ndrives me. Sure, there are goals I would\nlike to achieve, but I don\u2019t allow them\nto dictate my life. I don\u2019t help a friend\nin need because I am earning the kingdom of Heaven; I help my friend because he needs my aid.\nI don\u2019t steal not because I fear punishment (mortal and divine) if caught,\nbut because it is a bad thing to do.\nSeeking a reason to be good and enjoy\nlife is redundant and it can prevent you\nfrom doing it fully.\nLife and love are an end in them-selves. Forgive my cheesiness, but they\nare all about the journey, and not the\ndestination. Saying that atheists find\nlove dismal and futile because it has no\nevolutionary advantage is profoundly\nwrong. Every man or woman will\nfeel good when embracing a person\nthey care about, and atheists make no\ndifference.\nIf you want to believe that it is because a supernatural being ordered\nyou to, be my guest; but please do not\nclaim that because I don\u2019t, I\u2019m incapable of love.\nCaz Knight\u2019s comment piece\ntakes another hit, this time\nfrom Pietro Aronica\nmal and futile one\u201d?\nSorry. I was joking. The actual article is just one close-minded statement after another, sprinkled with the\nodd straw man or ad-hominem attack\non Richard Dawkins. Now really Caz,\ndo you have to say such un-Christian\nthings about the man\u2019s marriage? Does\nit really a bearing on the issue at hand?\nWhat would Pope Benedict XVI say?\nI\u2019m not too sure, but I have a feeling he would say something along the\nlines of your second paragraph being\nthe biggest straw man since the Wicker\nMan. You know the part where you implicitly align all atheists with the view\nof biological determinism? It\u2019s hardly\nfair. Not all of us believe our morals or\nfeelings can be reduced to a complex\nchain of chemical reactions. Maybe\nyou should make like Nicolas Cage and\nbe burned inside your carefully made\nstraw man. You don\u2019t deserve to be Edward Woodward.\nBut in all seriousness, there is a question somewhere among the shambles\nof an article that deserves an answer.\nThe question of whether humans can\nlive a meaningful life \u2013 of which many\nwould consider love a part \u2013 without a\npurpose provided by some ideal such\nas God is very poignant. It\u2019s something\nthat\u2019s put more eloquently in Jean-Paul\nSartre\u2019s \u2018Existentialism is a Humanism\u2019, where he notes a Catholic critic\u2019s\ncomment that \u201cwe forget how an infant\nsmiles\u201d.\nWhat this critic and Caz Knight seem\nto be missing in their close-minded-ness is that there can be beauty and\nmeaning without God. For someone\nlike Richard Dawkins, that beauty may\nbe in seeing the complex chain of biological determinism behind each and\nevery action, a biology that unites every human being. For me, this beauty is\nin the life-affirming freedom given to\nhumans without a God, a freedom to\ndo whatever I choose and to create my\nown essence. For atheists, life can be\nbeautiful. Unlike Caz Knight\u2019s article.\n\n"

You\nmake your own choice- but I think the\nsecond option is far more comical.\nHair styles: It\u2019s a way of linking computers together. Do you think that it\nhas hair? No you nobber.\nInteresting facts: There are no facts\nthat are interesting about WANs. That\nis unless of course you are studying\ncomputer science. If you are the pages\nare probably glued together as you are\na rather excitable bunch.\nBut did you know that the largest\nWAN is actually the Internet! Yes that\nplace which has an unlimited supply of\npornographic images! Kerching!\nGraphic Dingbats 1,436\nWinner was Peter de Boeck, who also provided\nsome vital information, even having the audacity\nto correct some: \u201calthough it should be noted that\n1,435 Solutions\n1.

Just look\nat his stupid elongated face. I want to\ngive it one hell of a smack. However in\n2006, Wan was approached by Channel\n4 and asked to present his own fashion show, \u201cHow to Look Good Naked.\n\u201d I\nthought it was pretty shit and only ever\nviewed it when channel hopping. I also\nbroke many TVs that year... mainly\nwith an airborne remote control aimed\nat his face.\nKnown for: Being an angry fashion\nconscious writer, and future Editor of\nthis fine paper.\nMost likely to: Not complete the first\nissue of felix until at least two weeks\nafter the deadline.\nMeaning of name: The name \u2018Dan\nWan\u2019 originally was first used in the\nfourteenth century as a nickname for\nthe great Chinese emperor Waniel.\nDan stated that his parents have no\nprevious knowledge of this. They lie.\nHair styles: Like Gok Wan, Dan likes\nto sport particularly shit hair. He also\nhas an ear piercing... like Gok Wan.\nHe also wears glasses... like Gok Wan.\nHe also comes from China... like Gok\nWan. Gok Wan is also gay... Dan??\nInteresting facts: Like all previous felix editors, Dan is as mad as a rabbit\non cocaine. In the past this has been\nrequired for the job.\nMore passed out people this week, so naturally\nwe will be printing all their exploits here. Obviously not for comical value- oh no. Here at felix\nwe want all of you to have fun after exams, but\nnot to cause damage to yourselves. See this as\na deterrent, so when you go for that final pint,\nthink... \u201cno! what about felix...? I\u2019ll be like one of\nTHEM.\u201d You\u2019ve been warned.\nT\nhis week is the penultimate\nissue that we will be writing for you hobos. So that\nmeans the FUCWIT is decided by the points gained\nfrom this issue! It\u2019s very tight at the\ntop of the team table, so time is of the\nessence.\nI must say that this year has been\npretty epic, I particularly like being able\nto rant and rave at anyone or anything\nin an uncensored fashion. Yes, I also\nwrite the horoscopes. If I have upset\nanyone, or if you think that I may have\ntaken things too far, you can piss off.\nWhy am I telling you this little nugget of\ninformation now you may ask? (Proba-bly not actually.) Well, for the next issue\nI am being replaced, I cried too when I\nheard, but change is for the best. I do\nhope you enjoyed them.\nI also wish to thank everyone who\nhas ever written in- seriously it makes\nthis \u2018job\u2019 considerably more enjoyable\nwhen people actually do the puzzles\nthat I take literally minutes creating. I\nknow you secretly care, as when I fuck\nup the abuse reigns down long and\nhard, so sod you all. It has been a wee\nbit shite that more people didn\u2019t get in-volved, but let\u2019s fact it, Imperial is full\nof ShLads. That\u2019s a shit lad to you or I.\nAnyhoo I wish to congratulate Dr Science! for climbing so high in the FUCWIT. Up to P2 in only about six weeks.\nWell done, a first for effort.\nFinally I want to tell you about the\ntime when Jov (our Editor-in-Chief)\nwas on the phone to Diane Abbott MP.\nIf any of you don\u2019t know, Jov is kind of\na big fella. Think first team Rugby prop.\nHe was talking to this MP, so naturally\nwho wouldn\u2019t lick their finger and shove\nit into his ear? Normal behaviour. Once\nhe put the phone down, this man erupted in a similar fashion to Mount Vesuvius when it destroyed Pompeii. Except\nthe lava was a three foot long cardboard\ntube. The type you put a picture in\nwhen you send it in the post. You know,\nquite hard. I took as much as I could,\nand as I lifted my leg to protect me, Jov,\nthe evil Serbian bastard then decided to\nplace a ringer right on my right ball. I\nshit you not when I say I almost vomited right there and then.\nIt was the most painful thing I have\never felt- even worse than a Hockey\nball to the face. No contest. I managed\nto stumble to the toilet in inspect the\ndamage. 10 minutes of groaning later,\nJov tells me that he is sorry and that Kadhim has been beaten too. Why? Well\nthe Serbian mongrel was unable to tell\nthe difference between a black woman\nand a Iraqi man. Kadhim pranked him.\nI had the shakes for two hours. Please\ncome join us next year!?!

I was one of them,\nof course, as I was eager to see if my\niPhone predictions were correct.\nAbout one hour and forty two minutes into the WWDC keynote, the\nnew iPhone was unveiled. Wait, no,\nthat\u2019s the 3G surely? Nope, it really is\nthe new 3G S which shares the same\nhousing as its 3G cousin. I couldn\u2019t\nstop smiling, not only because it shattered many fanboys\u2019 dream of a video-calling, matte black device, but also\nthis put an end to all those ridiculous\n\u201cleaked\u201d pictures.\nWhile the 3G S has adopted the one-year old appearance, the hardware inside is fairly impressive, most notably\nthe new camera which not only takes\nmuch greater pictures but can also\nrecord smooth videos. You can find\nout more about the new iPhone in\nMarc\u2019s article.\nDespite this great internal boost,\nmany Apple fans expressed great disappointment over the lack of major\noverhauls. One member on a forum I\nmoderate simply accused Apple of being \u201cafraid of changing the design, or\nthat they just couldn\u2019t be bothered to\ncome up with a new look as suckers\nwill still buy the new iPhone anyway.\nEven rice cookers get restyled every so\noften, let alone mobile phones.\u201d\nI paused. On one hand I agree that\nany company releasing a new product\nin an old shell would be a potential suicidal act, but on the other hand I see\nno need for Apple to change the current design, and this isn\u2019t the first time\nthat Apple has made little change to a\nproduct\u2019s appearance.\nApple\u2019s product lifecycles are quite\nunique, with each design blueprint of\ncomputers usually lasting for at least\ntwo years, and at least one year for\niPod products. Most other companies\nuse a more aggressive and wasteful\napproach to ensure that a slightly different looking model appears each\nmonth, or at least give them a frequent\nminor spec bump in order to let the\npress know that they are still well and\nalive.\nInterestingly, Apple doesn\u2019t need to\ntell anyone what they are up to, leaving\npeople outside Infinite Loop wondering what beautiful products Steve Jobs\nand co. could possibly be working on.\nHowever, this cult-like secrecy alone\nwouldn\u2019t be enough to stir up all the\nhype from each product launch \u2013 it is\nthe amount of attention put into each\ndesign that wins over onlookers\u2019.\nAccording to BusinessWeek, Michael\nLopp, Senior Engineering Manager at\nApple, revealed at SXSW 2008 how the\nApple team spends a huge amount of\ntime to make ten highly realistic picture mockups, before carefully picking out just three and then spend a\nfew more months on them, and eventually picking the final winner. If this\nis indeed true, it is no wonder that we\nkeep hearing rumours from the industry about certain exciting projects, yet\nnever seeing them materialize (e.g. the\nMac tablet that ASUS claimed to be\nhelping Apple to develop).\nThe process doesn\u2019t end here.\nJonathan Ive, Senior Vice President of\nIndustrial Design at Apple, is known\nto personally make several trips to the\noutsourced factories in China, making\nsure that every tiny detail on the production line are perfected to his own\nhigh standard. Such dedication from\nthis Londoner sure makes us Brits\nproud.\nTo wrap this up, one thing is for sure:\nApple is definitely working on something big in a secret warehouse as we\nspeak, but judging on recent product\ncycles, the next big leap for the MacBook will probably not be until late\n2011. If you can\u2019t wait, the iMac will\nprobably get a significant refresh later\nthis year or early next year. As for the\niPhone, I doubt there will be anything\nnew coming out until next summer,\nbut I can wait.\nOr just get the Palm Pre.\nIt\u2019s a waiting\ngame...\nNew toys from Apple\nMarc Kerstein covers Apple\u2019s latest WWDC keynote address\nO\nn Monday 8th, Apple\nhosted their annual\n\u201cWorldwide Developers Conference\u201d, or\n\u201cWWDC\u201d for short.\nLike Macworld, WWDC\u2019s keynote\npresentation has announced the release of a range of groundbreaking\nhardware and software since 1996.\nThis year\u2019s keynote began with the\nwell-received announcement of price\ncuts across Apple\u2019s notebook range.\nThe 13-inch aluminium MacBook saw\nthe welcome addition of an SD card slot\nand FireWire 800, and has been added\nto Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro line. The 15-inch MacBook Pro gained the same,\nbut at the cost of its ExpressCard slot.\nPersonally, I only used my ExpressCard\nslot with an SD card adaptor, but for\nthose who made more use of the slot,\nthe 17-inch model still has it built in.\nOther than the price drops across the\nMacBook Pro line, significant changes\nsuch as the backlit keyboard becoming the default for the 13-inch, or the\nchange from the NVIDIA 9600M to\nthe 9400M in the 15-inch base model\nhave also come into effect. All MacBook Pros (including the 13-inch)\nnow come with a non-removable bat-tery. Although not a problem for most,\nsome may find this annoying. As a\ncompromise, however, Apple claim\nthat the changes to the internal structure of the machines ensure that the\nlarger built-in battery will last longer\non a single charge, and through 1000\ncharge cycles.\nNext, the leader of the OS X team,\nBertrand Serlet, began the anticipated\nannouncement of new features in Apple\u2019s forthcoming operating system,\nOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, only after\npointing out several \u201cunaddressed issues\u201d in Microsoft\u2019s Windows 7. Snow\nLeopard will offer many refinements\nfrom Leopard, such as the Finder being\nrewritten in Cocoa, an enhanced Expos\u00e9, and the new QuickTime X. Snow\nLeopard will be available this September, and cost just $29 to upgrade from\nLeopard (UK price TBA).\nThe most anticipated section of the\nkeynote began when Scott Forstall,\nApple\u2019s SVP for iPhone software took\nthe stage. After a quick recap of previously announced features for iPhone\nOS 3.0 (available from June 17th), several enthusiastic accessory and application developers demonstrated their\nupcoming products for the iPhone,\nsuch as TomTom. The first turn-by-turn car navigation application for the\niPhone was demonstrated, and the\nTomTom employees left the stage to\ngreat applause.\nA new feature of MobileMe was also\nannounced. The new \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d\nservice gives MobileMe subscribers\nthe ability to view their iPhone\u2019s current location on a map. A custom\nmessage can also be sent to the device,\nalong with a sound to help locate it.\nMore noteworthy, however, is the ability to remotely erase all data on the device if stolen or lost, a feature already\navailable to Microsoft Exchange users,\nand a great addition to MobileMe.\nAt the end of the keynote, the iPhone\n3G S was announced. The new features\nwere shown, such as a long awaited upgrade to the camera with 3 megapixels\nand autofocus, finally capable of recording video. The phone also includes\na digital compass that rotates Google\nMaps the correct way, and a new compass application. The iPhone 3G S is\naround twice as fast as the iPhone 3G,\nand also has an increased battery life,\nmaking it a great upgrade from the\niPhone 3G.\nDespite being the first WWDC with\nno appearance from Apple\u2019s famous\nCEO Steve Jobs, Apple presented an\nextensive keynote, covering new Mac\nhardware and software, along with\nan aggressive upgrade to the hardware and software of their dominant\niPhone, with surprisingly early release\ndates, and massive price drops.\nApple\u2019s \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d Feature - essential for those drunken nights!\n\u201cSnow Leopard\nwill offer many\nrefinements from\nLeopard\u201d\nWWDC in the Spotlight\niPhone 3G S\n\u2022 2x the speed of the iPhone 3G\n\u2022 3MP camera with autofocus\n\u2022 Records video at VGA resolution\n\u2022 Built in digital compass\n\u2022 Voice control\n\u2022 Better battery life than iPhone\n3G\n\u2022 iPhone 3G price cut dramatically\nMacBook Pro\n\u2022 Aluminium 13\u201d MacBook now\nMacBook Pro\n\u2022 Price drop to \u00a3899 (\u00a3772.80 with\nHE discount + free iPod touch)\n\u2022 Addition of SD card slot for 13\u201d and\n15\u201d models, removal of ExpressCard from 15\u201d model\n\u2022 Addition of FireWire 800 to the entire line\nSnow Leopard\n\u2022 Faster operating system than\nLeopard\n\u2022 Reclaim around 6GB after upgrade from Leopard\n\u2022 Innovative Chinese character input (using trackpad)\n\u2022 Google contact list synchronization with Address Book\n\u2022 Upgrade in September for $29\n\n"

Back\nthen the Greek Gods were calling the\nshots; wouldn\u2019t they have just loved the\nsport? How about the Trojans taking\non the Spartans who would no doubt\nhave dominated the tournament, with\nAres, the God of War, at open side\nflank, Zeus, the God of Thunder, at\ninside center and Athena, the Goddess\nof strategic battle and wisdom, as their\nhead coach!?\nIt\u2019s about time rugby returned to the\ngreat heights of Olympos, the famous\nmountain that was the \u2018home of the\nGods\u2019 in ancient Greek mythology.\nThe International Olympic Committee is meeting in a few weeks to discuss\npotential new sports to be included.\nIn October a decision on the Olympic Sports Programme for 2016 will\nbe made at a meeting in Copenhagen\n- there are two vacant slots. Rugby is\ncompeting with several other sports\nwhich include karate, golf and squash.\nMax Joachim In 2005, rugby\u2019s bid to get back into the\n[2012] Olympics \u2013 the last time it was,\nbeing in 1924 \u2013 failed in 2005 but this\ntime it has got the support from people\nall over the world.\nolympic-rugby.org is a grass-roots,\nrugby players\u2019 initiative that will try to\ncollect millions of signatures for the\nOlympic rugby cause through media\nstunts and viral action (Ed - Hopefully\nthe sort of viral action which doesn\u2019t\nlead to a worsening of the swine flu\npandemic). They have already gathered the support from the best sevens\nrugby nations in the world including England, New Zealand and world\nchampions Wales. This week, they\nstarted the Olympic toga campaign \u2013\nput on a bed sheet, put some leaves\non your head and dress as an ancient\nGreek. Sevens rugby is a spectacular,\nhigh scoring, fast-paced, exciting and\nan easy to understand game that will\nbe a gateway for all forms of rugby to\nexperience growth and large international support. No doubt, sevens and\nthe fan culture will add a lot of character and colour to the Games.\nNow you have a chance to make Olympic history! Engage! Go to olympic-rugby.org and add your signature.\nThe England 7s team are behind the Olympic bid\nI\nam sick and tired of people having nothing better or constructive to ask besides \u201cwhere do\nyou live?\u201d\nNo I am not talking about a\nconversation with someone from the\nBNP security detail but if you\u2019re still\nconfused then I ask any football (soc-cer) fan to go to our godforsaken union\nor any other public house which show\nfootball matches.\nNot long ago I did this and partway\nthrough the game after the team I support happened to score I was asked by\na random fan the question I highlighted earlier. \u201cBut that is nowhere near\u201d\nthe home stadium of where my team of\nchoice play, he replied. \u201cSo?\u201d I retorted\nand we went back and forth before he\nwas satisfied (pause) that I was a real\nsupporter of the club. This only seems\nto happen with football and more often\nthan not these interrogators are phil-Mustapher Botchway\nSports Editor\nMisinformed critics,\neither get informed\nor stay silent.\nistines when actually discussing the\nbeautiful game. On a different occasion after receiving a similar barrage of\nquestions, I overheard this particular\nperson spout some of the most ridiculous things heard from a fellow follower of football. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he pass\nthe ball forward? He\u2019s shit\u201d after an attacking midfielder laid it of to a winger\nwho crossed the ball which resulted in\na corner. Or \u201che\u2019s miles onside\u201d whilst\nthe replay showed that you could have\nan IQ of a knat and have seen he was\n4 yards offside, without needing to see\nthe replay.\nPerhaps he was an American football commentator in disguise but this\nhappens all too often for this to be the\ncase.\nThough I digress. Addressing the\npoint at hand, football is arguably the\nmost global sport bar athletics (track\nand field). It certainly is the most globalised in terms of attracting money and the diversity of its fan base.\nClubs such as the European stalwarts\nReal Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester\nUnited and AC Milan have more fans\noutside their respective countries than\nin. Are these fans not allowed to support them because they in Spain, UK\nor Italy?\nSaying that there is a serious issue\nregarding the biggest scourge of the\nfootballing community after the hooligan and that is the glory hunter, but I\nhave found that these people are supporting teams who have recently come\ninto some money. Pre-2004 I knew one\nChelsea supporter (and I am from West\nLondon) but after the \u2018Special One\u2019\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho put the \u00a3150 million or\nso of Roman Abramovichs money to\ngood use there was a massive influx of\nsupporters of The Blues. This disgusted me as I am unsure as to who they\nsupported before but I predict that in a\nfew years Manchester City will receive\nsimilar success in attracting such fickle\nfans. Meanwhile Real Madrid will soon\nhave more fans than the population of\nChina and thus will become the next\neconomic superpower.\nIn other news, after finally reading\nthe list of ACC Colours recipients, I\nam again disgusted. Apparently they\nare awarded to people who have shone\namongst their peers but I have not\nseen a bigger celebration of mediocrity in my life. Firstly I congratulate\nyou for receiving colours etcetera you\nhave worked hard but one just needs to\nlook at our felix sport table and some\nof the recipients of colours and then go\nfigure.\nAnd treasurer of the year? This isn\u2019t\nthe Imperial College beancounting\nawards.\nSome football fans would be better off watching and commenting on this\nPicture\nof\nthe\nWeek\nThe\nWealth\nof\nthe\nPoor\nby\nRaghav\nSaboo\n2st\nyear\nChemical\nEngineer\nWe\nwant\nto\nexhibit\nyour\nart.\nSend\nin\nyour\nphotographs.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Plenty of people will be going\nthrough their stuff wondering what\nthey were thinking when they bought\na particularly interesting but useless\nitem. How much of your stuff will you\nrealistically take back with you over the\nsummer?\nAn increasing amount of re-usable\nitems are being sent to landfill in the\nUK, even those in good condition\nwhich can be re-used by others. In\nuniversities and in particular in halls\nof residence, a waste peak occurs during move-out at the end-of-term, when\nstudents want to get rid of anything\nthey cannot or do not want to take\nhome with them.\nHow to sensibly dispose of the waste\ngenerated from move-out weekend\nis a real issue for the accommodation\nteams who often need to clear rooms\nand prepare them for summer vacation guests on the same weekend, and\nin some cases, the same day as the students move out.\nThis year, Imperial\u2019s Accommodation Services and Facilities Management departments have joined forces\nwith re-use organisation, CRISP, in\nan effort to minimise waste during\nmoving-out weekend. CRISP provide\ntools for universities to facilitate a reuse service which allows students to\ndonate any unwanted items for re-use\nas they move out of halls. Re-using unwanted goods is far better for the environment than recycling as it reduces\nthe use of natural resources.\nThe scheme will be running for the\nlast two weeks of term and each College owned hall will have a designated\nspace which will be used as a donation\ndrop-point. Items will need to be sorted into different categories and then\nplaced in the bins provided. You can\ndonate all sorts of things such as:\n\u2022 clothes and shoes\n\u2022 bedding and bed linen\n\u2022 unopened non-perishable food\nitems, e.g. canned goods\n\u2022 kitchen items such as cutlery,\nplates, pots and pans\n\u2022 electricals like lamps, computers\nand printers\n\u2022 CDs, DVDs and books\n\u2022 stationery \u2013 folders, pens, pencils\netc\nLeena Barrett\nCommercial Services\nAre you moving out of\nhalls? Re-use don\u2019t waste\n\u2022 furniture\n\u2022 you can also donate any mixed paper for recycling\nCRISP will collect all donations\nand redistribute to reuse outlets such\nas charity shops, hospitals, markets,\ncouncils, homeless shelters and many\nothers. Last year CRISP worked with\n38 university halls providing accommodation to 8962 students from over\n14 different universities located in 10\ninner London boroughs. Over the\nsummer period in 2008, the project\ncollected 23.98 tonnes of unwanted\ngoods and materials for reuse \u2013 the\nequivalent of 0.69 tonnes per hall.\nIf you\u2019ll be moving out of halls and\nhave items to donate, you\u2019ll find details\nof your hall\u2019s drop-point around your\nhall or you can ask your Hall Supervisor or Warden for more information.\nTwo men found guilty of the\nmurder of UROP students\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor-in-Chief\nAfter six weeks, the trial of Dano Sonnex and Nigel Farmer at the Old Bailey\nhas come to an end, with both men being convicted of murdering two French\nexchange-students studying at Imperial College. Dano Sonnex, 23, must\nserve a minimum sentence of 40-years\nin prison whilst Nigel Farmer, 33, must\nserve 35 years.\nThe trial has, however, brought to\nlight the failings of the Crown Prosecution Service and the Probation Service after it was found that Mr Sonnex\nhad committed multiple offenses since\nhe was released in February 8th 2008.\nAt the age of 17 he was sentenced to\n8 years in jail after a string of armed\nrobberies and in 2004 he admitted to\na prison doctor that he feared that he\nmight kill in the future, but this information was never passed on to the\nprison service. After only a few days of\nhis release in February 2008, Mr Sonnex had allegedly tied up a pregnant\nwoman and her boyfriend, however,\nhis probation officer only gave him a\nverbal warning instead of sending him\nback to jail.\nAn order was given to the police to\narrest Mr Sonnex on the 13th June\n2008, however, the police didn\u2019t actually visit his house until 14:00 on 29th\nJune after there was some confusion as\nto which police force would handle the\narrest. By the time the police actually\ngot to his house, the bodies of Laurent\nBonomo and Gabriel Ferez had been\ndiscovered and it took 11 days for the\npolice to arrest Mr Sonnex after Mr\nFarmer handed himself in at Lewisham\npolice station.\nThese failings have angered the public and as a result David Scott, head of\nthe London Probation Service, has resigned and Justice Secretary Jack Straw\nhas made a personal apology to the victims\u2019 families.\nMr Straw said of the criticism, \u201cthere\nis nothing that anyone can do to bring\nthese entirely innocent French stu-dents, these sons, back to life. But what\nwe have to do is learn the lessons, and\nthese lessons have been pursued ever\nsince that I learnt about these failures\nat the end of last year.\u201d\nDano Sonnex (left) and Nigel Farmer (right) were convicted of murder\n\n"

The lessons took place\nall over the island, in some of the most\nremote and preserved parts of the\nLaurisilva forests. Once the students\nreturned to London, the sketches were\nreworked and inspired fifty other students to also paint the protected landscapes of Madeira.\nMadeira is an archipelago with volcanic origins from a hot spot; a static\nsource of volcanic activity which results in multiple islands as the tectonic\nplate moves over it (Ed: geologists, I\u2019m\nsure I\u2019ve got something wrong here, but\nI gave it my best shot!). Because of the\nhot spot, Madeira is not geographically part of any specific continent, but\nit has belonged, ethnically, culturally,\neconomically and politically to Portugal for some 600 years.\nWhen the original settlers landed on\nthe island, they set fire to the indigenous laurisilva subtropical rainforest\nwhich once covered the whole island\nto clear the land for farming. However,\nin the north, the valleys contain native\ntrees of fine growth. These Laurisilva forests, notably the forests on the\nnorthern slopes of Madeira Island, are\ndesignated a World Heritage Site by\nUNESCO.\nThe project was supported by several bodies, including the natural park\nof Madeira, UNESCO, Casa da Cultura\nde Camara de Lobos and a top art museum in Portugal \u2013 Centro das Artes\nda Casa das Mudas.\nOnce the work was finished, the\npieces was exhibited by the two mu-seums; Casa da Cultura de Camara de\nLobos exhibited the paintings between\n4th April and 2nd May, whilst Centro\ndas Artes da Casa das Mudas exhibited the paintings between 3rd April\nand 23rd April. Nelson Ferreira commented that:\n\u201cI wanted to make my students aware\nof the environmental issues affecting some of the most stunning places\nworldwide \u2013 and the beauty of the natural landscapes of Madeira did appeal\nto their artistic minds.\u201d\n\u201cThese projects have also made the\nstudents feel more confident about\nthemselves and their artistic abilities\nand created a bit of a buzz by showing at two international art museums\nand with the support of institutions as\nUNESCO and the media coverage that\nit generated in Portugal, which included national newspaper articles and TV\ninterview.\u201d\nThis is not the first \u201cWorld Heritage Site trip\u201d that the group have done.\nEvery three months they go away to\nvarious locations to paint and have\nbeen to such places like the historical\ncentre of Porto, museums in Berlin and\nto Sintra.\nFerreira went on to say that:\n\u201cThese frequent \u2018World Heritage\nSite\u2019 visit art projects have changed\nmany students\u2019 opinion on what an\nideal world should be.\u201d\nTheir next trips will be to Rome in a\ncouple of weeks and then a trip to the\nDouro Valley in September.\nIf you\u2019re interested in some art\nclasses, contact Nelson Ferreira\nat nsf@mail.com\n\u201cI wanted to\nmake students\naware of the\nenvironmental\nissues affecting\nsome of the most\nstunning places\nworldwide\u201d\nThe students\u2019 artwork on display.

There are many places\nin London to catch one of these annual celebrations: the Globe Theatre,\nRegent\u2019s Park open-air theatre and of\ncourse our very own Queen\u2019s Lawn.\nYes, in what is becoming a mini-tra-dition, DramSoc is once again presenting a Shakespeare comedy. Following\non from the stately Much Ado About\nNothing last year, this year\u2019s model is\nTwelfth Night, Or What You Will; and\nif the YouTube trailer is anything to\nby, this is a production with its tongue\nfirmly in its cheek. \u201cWhat\u201d, I hear you\nask, \u201cdoes this have to offer that the\nGlobe or Regent\u2019s Park players can\u2019t?\u201d\nWell, for starters it\u2019s FREE, it\u2019s close,\nand you can bring a beer.\nStarting two years ago as a result of\na half-drunken conversation during a\nbar night, it was thought a good idea to\nperform A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\non Midsummer\u2019s Night. The 21st June.\nDuring exam term\u2026 riiiighhht.\nWell, back then a director, production team and cast of characters was\nfound crazy enough to take on learning Shakespeare in and around exams,\ntreating it as an escape and relaxation\ntechnique. Two years later the imminent production of Twelfth Night, Or\nWhat You Will stands as testament to\nthe success of the first production.\nBeyond the generic plot description\nyou expect with Shakespeare com-edies, Twelfth Night is the one where\nthe twins \u2013 Sebastian and Viola: one\nmale, one female \u2013 get shipwrecked on\nthe shore of a foreign country. Believing her brother to be dead, Viola decides to disguise herself as a man called\nCaesario (as you do) and work for the\nlocal Duke, Orsino. He in turn is besotted with a local noble woman, Olivia, who ignores his \u2013 and any man\u2019s\n\u2013 advances as she is still in mourning for her dead brother and father...\n(Deep breath)... Orsino sends Caesario\nto woo Olivia on his behalf and Olivia\nfalls head over heels in love with him/\nher. All this is further complicated by\nthe fact that Viola is beginning to get\nromantic stirrings for her boss, Orsino.\nGot that? Good. Chuck in the possibility of someone who looks exactly like\nher/him still walking around, a butler\nwith some particularly garish clothing\nand a couple of drunk troublemakers,\nand you have hilarity on a stick \u2013 and\nthe language doesn\u2019t even stand in the\nway!\nWhy Shakespeare again? Well, we\nsearched high and low for an alter-native, something different, but as\nexplained above, there is a certain\ninevitability about Shakespeare and\nsummer. No matter what you do, you\ncome back to it. As a matter of fact,\nwe challenge anyone to come up with\nsomething that works outdoors (with\na good distribution of parts so that no\none fails exams) as well as Shakespeare\ndoes.\nSeeing as the previous two productions have occurred in the final week\nof the academic year, they have the\nquite welcome side-effect of rounding off the year and the #@!*ing exam\nperiod. Previous audience members\ncommented on how great it was to sit,\nchill, watch a show and get rid of murderous thoughts of lecturers who have\nshafted you by setting questions that\nhad nothing to do with the course they\n\u2018taught\u2019. All-in-all, a vital service to the\nstudent populace, and even more so to\nlecturers.\nWith all this in the pot, it is a great\ntime to prove to the uneducated, and\nreaffirm to the conversant, that Shakespeare is:\na) Understandable\nb) Accessible\nc) FUNNY!!!\nMay you kick the ass of every exam,\nand hope to see you on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn.\nDramSoc perform Twelfth Night,\nOr What You Will on Sunday 21st\nJune at 14:00 and Thursday 25th\nJune at 18:00 and 21:30.\nSir Toby Bell (Pranav Mahajan) in character (honest!)\nThe House of Olivia from left to right: Malvolio, Feste and Maria\nOlivia can\u2019t tell the twins apart either\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix Friday 12 June 2009\nAll right, then, not really. Still, a lot of\npeople believe passionately in a whole\nrange of \u2018alternative\u2019 remedies for ailments ranging from the common cold\nthrough to HIV and cancer: the one\nthing that all these remedies have in\ncommon is that no-one\u2019s ever been\never to prove that any of them work.\nMost of them are fairly harmless: take,\nfor example, the acupuncture advertised in the sports pages of felix two\nweeks ago [issue 1,433] \u2013 acupuncture\nhas been repeatedly shown to be nothing more than a really theatrical pla-cebo. While patients do report a better\nresponse with acupuncture than with\nplacebo tablets, you\u2019ll receive exactly\nthe same therapeutic benefit if your\nmate stabs you with cocktail sticks\nwhilst reading from a Chinese takea-way menu1. Draw your own conclusions regarding the healing power of\nQi.\nStill, the consequences of alternative\nmedicine and its surrounding culture\naren\u2019t always so benign. Next week,\na conference in Holland will seek to\nextend the practice of homeopathy in\nthe developing world, (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa), to treat diseases such\nas AIDS, malaria and cholera. This is\nnot a good idea. To protest about the\nconference and to raise awareness of\nthe problems posed by the use of alternative treatments in Africa, Sense\nAbout Science have asked the WHO\nto condemn the promotion of it and\nother untested, unproven or outright\nfraudulent miracle cures in vulnerable\nareas of the world.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the\npractice, homeopathy involves taking\nsomething poisonous, then repeatedly\ndiluting it (banging it with a Bible in\nbetween), on the principle that \u2018like\ncures like\u2019, and that dilutions make the\ntreatment stronger. So far, so counter-intuitive, but the ridiculousness of the\nwhole affair only really become apparent when you look at the numbers.\nHere comes the science bit \u2013 stay with\nme\u2026\nAvogadro\u2019s number, the number of\nmolecules in one mole of a substance,\nis 6.02 \u00d7 1023, so a really concentrated\nsolution might hold 1024 molecules of\nsolute per litre of water. This is lot of\nzeroes, but then again it\u2019s going to get\npretty dilute. Each of a homeopath\u2019s serial dilutions effectively involves a millilitre of solution being dropped into a\nlitre of water: a dilution of 103, or 1C in\nhomeopath-speak. Standard \u2018strength\u2019\n(I use the term loosely) homeopathic remedies are 30C, or 1090 times\nweaker than the original \u2013 meaning\nthat you\u2019d have to look through 1067\nlitres of water to have a fighting chance\nof containing a single molecule of the\noriginal mixture. In real terms, that\u2019s\naround the size of the solar system.\nThat\u2019s going to take some drinking.\nSo, this final jar of extremely pure\nwater is sprinkled on some sugar pills,\nand given to people to cure all ail-ments. It\u2019s not too big a deal if it\u2019s for\nsomething trivial: colds and headaches\nwill normally get better on their own,\nhay-fever will vanish mysteriously\naround September time \u2013 and it\u2019s fair\nto say that homeopathic treatments\nwill do you no direct harm whatsoever,\nunless you\u2019re lactose intolerant. On the\nflip side, if you take them for a serious\ncondition and don\u2019t take real drugs too,\nyou\u2019re going to die. This is where the\nproblems arise.\nThe people selling these \u2018remedies\u2019\ngenuinely believe they work, and can\u2019t\nunderstand why nasty, sceptical people\nlike us won\u2019t take them seriously. So\nwhat if it doesn\u2019t perform in clinical\ntrials? It must be because it\u2019s too radi-cal, too magical a treatment to be detected by such mundane tools. The upshot of this is a general distrust of real\nmedicine: for example, Jeremy Sherr,\none of the speakers at next week\u2019s con-ference, is on record as saying that if\nanti-retroviral drugs are given to African children with AIDS \u201cthey will die\nvery quickly\u201d. It is people pushing ineffective pills while denigrating proven\nand effective treatments that pose the\nreal dangers.\nWhile no-one doubts that those attending the conference will be doing\nso with the best of intentions, if they\nproceed with their proposals then\nmany people could die unnecessarily\nof diseases that are largely treatable, or\ncan at least be effectively managed by\nproven, effective therapies. This isn\u2019t\njust about sneering at aging hippies;\nit isn\u2019t even about promoting science:\nit\u2019s about the lives of patients who have\nnot had the benefit of a science education and are unable to distinguish between real medicine and magic beans\nwhen a \u2018doctor\u2019 gives them pills.\nMagic beans save the world?\nDuncan Casey\nWe have a right not to be tortured. It is\na basic human right \u2013 one that stretches across borders and cultures to societies that share few other values. The\ncondemnation of torture is a constant\nwhere many other things are not.\nBut what do we mean by torture:\nforcing prisoners to stand for hours\nat a time? Playing them the same song\nover and over for three days? Recreating the feeling of drowning? Under international law, none of these are. They\nare mentally, but not physically abu-sive. And torture is defined as physical\nabuse.\nThe public debate following Obama\u2019s\nrelease of the details of CIA interrogations in Guantanamo has centred\nround whether or not these mentally abusive techniques are torturous\nenough to make them illegal. And new\nresearch published last week adds to\nthe mounting evidence that they are,\nor at least that they should be.\nTorture victims from former Yugoslavia countries and Turkey rated the\nstressfulness of their overall torture ex-perience. Those that experienced high\nlevels of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (CIDT), such as forced\nstress positions or waterboarding, rated their overall torture experience as\nmore stressful than those who suffered\nphysical torture. CIDT victims also\nshowed higher rates of post-traumatic\nstress disorder.\n\u201cThere is a widely held misconception of torture,\u201d said Dr. Metin Basoglu,\nauthor of the study. \u201cIt is not just something that happens in the course of the\ninterrogation process. It incorporates\nall of the other circumstances in which\nthese events occur.\u201d\nBasoglu identifies 46 different contextual factors and it was the stress\nthese caused that participants were\nasked to rate. \u201cThink of it from the perspective of the person. They perceive\na wide range of stressors, even when\nthese stressors are not intentionally\ninflicted upon the person for torture\npurposes.\u201d\nIt is not just that context is impor-tant. It is more important than the\namount of physical pain. There is no\nclear correlation between increased\nphysical pain and overall stress. But\nthe correlation between CIDT and\noverall stress implies that psychological context is influential.\nTherefore, Basoglu argues, the definition of torture used in International\nlaw should be modified. \u201cIt would be\nbased on four parameters\u201d Intent,\npurpose and removal of control are all\nwidely-accepted criteria for torture.\nBut Basoglu adds a fourth criterion:\n\u201cmultiple stressors must be present.\u201d\nSo, both combinations of physical\nevents and psychologically stressful\nsituations would constitute torture under this definition.\nOthers argue this kind of international redefinition is impractical and\nunnecessary. \u201cChanging international\nlaw is not a relevant solution requires\na lot of energy and negotiations. And it\nwould take a long time to go through,\u201d\nsaid Professor Henry Shue, Professor\nof International Relations at Oxford\nUniversity and author of an influential\nwriter on torture. Instead, he believes\nthat what needs to be changed is the\nUS legal definition of torture.\n\u201cUnder the UN Convention law both\ntorture and what Basoglu calls CIDT\nare illegal. So the distinction between\nthem does not much matter. But when\nthe US ratified the convention in 1988,\nReagan interpreted the convention as\nonly applying to physical abuse and\npsychological conditions arising from\nphysical abuse.\u201d This meaning is the\none that was incorporated into US\nlaw in 2006 in the Military Commissions Act. Shue emphasised that \u201cthis\nis not something that started with Richard Cheney and George Bush\u201d. But\nunder the recent Bush administration\nit became law. And despite publishing\ntorture memos detailing interrogation techniques used in Guantanamo,\nObama has done nothing to reverse\nthe distinction between the UN convention and US law.\n\u201cI am disappointed with Obama\u2019s\nresponse on this issue. He has said he\nwishes to abolish torture, but has not\naddressed the definition of torture,\u201d\nShue said. He explained that it still\nleaves open the possibility of future\nGuantanamo like interrogations.\nIn the face of research like Basolgu\u2019s,\nit is difficult to see how America can\nkeep using the narrow Reagan defini-tion. Redefining torture might seem\nlike a pedantic effort in the case of\ninternational law. But in the US, we\nhave already witnessed the horrifying\nconsequences of leaving a gap between\nwhat is torturous and what is law.\nLet\u2019s hope the Obama administration\ndoesn\u2019t let this linger \u2013 that they don\u2019t\nlet it become their first mistake\nJessica Bland\nThe psychiatry of torture:\nwaterboarding and pain\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience\nBecome an Editor!\nDo you have what it takes\nto be the Science Editor at\nfelix newspaper?
