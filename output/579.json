Being a third year\napplying for PhDs, etc., I 've had\nthe pleasure of sampling food at\nLancaster, Birmingham and Warwick.\nAt Lancaster you could get a good three course meal with a choice of several main courses\nand deserts for \u00a31. The tables\nwere ready laid and the cutlery,\netc., was spotlessly clean, and\nthere was even someone to collect\nthe dishes after you had lin is he d! At Birmingham I was taken to\nthe stall refectory where a very\ngood main course and pudding\nwas \u00a31. There was a wide choice\nand the standard was extremely\nhigh. The cutlery and tables\nagain were clean. I was also told\nthat a two course meal in the\nunion was about 60p.At Warwick a good main course was about 50p and there\nwas a choice of about six. Again\nthe food was excellent. They had\nserviettes saying \"University of\nWarwick Catering Service, our\naim is to please at all times\". I only wish the same could be said\nabout our catering.\nIam in Linstead Hall and\ntherefore forced to sample at least\nthree meals per week at \u00a31.37\neach (or at least pay for them).\nThe standard is far lower than at\nany other university I 've sampled,\nmore expensive, and there's no\nchoice ol food. The crockery and\ncutlery is often not as clean as it\nought to be and the food is often\ncold. We often throw it in the bin\nafter one mouthful.\nIf other universities can provide a good meal with a choice for around \u00a3\\ for an unknown number of people, surely Mooney can for \u00a31.37 lor a known number.\nL Cornwall\nPhysics 3\nDear Sir\nThere are a number of com-men tsI would like to make concerning the Cons oc poll published in last week's FELIX. First, I find it difficult to\nbelieve that a poll carried out in this fashion by any political group, not just Consoc, can hope\nto produce a meaningful result.\nSecond, and specifically on the\ndisarmament questions, it is clear\nthat if these questions had been\nphrased and ordered differently\nquite opposite response might\nhave resulted. An equally valid\nopening question could have\nbeen: \" Do you believe there will\nbe a nuclear war in your life-time?\" Perhaps followed by: \" Do you expect to survive such a war?\" Another example of Consoc's bias on this issue can be\nseen in the February edition of\nthe Cons oc Comic, Morning Cloud. In stating their case\nagainst C ND the Chairman had\nthis to say about the cost of\nBritain's independent deterrent:\n\" . . . the cost of maintaining Britain's nuclear deterrent (as\nopposed to introducing a new\nsystem) is about \u00a3126m per year\n\u2014 or less than the annual budget\nof the London Borough of Camden\". It is, of course, the\n\u00a35,000m which will be spent on\nthe new Trident system that is\nthe important figure. Finally, I would just like to mention last\nterm'sU GM where at least five\ntimes the number of students\npolled by Consoc voted by a large majority in favour of C ND. Tours sincerely\nMartin Casey\nPhysics PG Dear Sir,\nLast week I was distressed by\nthe double booking of the Concert\nHall from the 11th to 14th of\nMarch, with the classic Italian\nOpera 'II Fornicazione' clashing\nwith our own final of the Home Counties Amateur Dramatic\nFestival. After discussion with the\ndirector of 'II Fornicazione' we\nhave agreed to run the two shows\nconcurrently, opening each night\nwith a shortened version of the\nopera. As a concession we have\nagreed to allow the opera to take\npart in the competition, which\nwill incidentally be judged by the\naudiences. The results will be\npublished in the national press\n(and in FELIX). Tickets are\navailable from both your Dramsoc and the bookshop.\nI would like to thank Mr Lovett, the director of Tl Fornicazione' for his cooperation\nin this matter.\nTours faithfully\nGeoffrey Barber\nLiason Officer\nHam Dram'81 Dear Sir\nWe wish our utter disgust\nabout a certain phrase which\nappeared both in the editorial of\nNo577( referring to the capabilities of HRH Princess Anne) and\nalso in the letters to the Editor in\nNo578( referring to your own\nspecial talents). This phrase (\"the\nintellect of a cauliflower and the\nability of a mollusc\") degrades\nnot only the common slug but a variety of other species in this\nphylum \u2014 snails, whelks, oysters,\nsquid, oct up uses, etc.\nIf you want to go insulting\nharmless invertebrates we suggest\nthe coe lent e rates, Crustacea, echinoderms or arachnids but not\nthe molluscs.\nWe demand an immediate apology.\nTours sincerely\nThe Campaign for Mollusc and\nCauliflower Equality\nSit\nHaving attended the Links \"Benefit\" Carnival, duly having\npaid \u00a33 on the door, we the\nundersigned should like it to be\nknown that we did not find 'Otway and Barrett' in the least\nentertaining.\nWe would like to correct your\narticle of last Friday which stated\nthat everyone left the Carnival at\nthe end of Otway and Barrett's act; they left BEFORE the end of\ntheir performance (a wise move!).\nHaving read your article we\nsuppose that Links must have\npaid a sizeable chunk of the\n\u00a31,800 take at the door to the\naforementioned pair (how else\ndid they squander all that money?). Was it really worth it as\nNightline was not better off at the\nend? \u2014 No Dice Stevie Baby!\nTours\nRJ Nevin, MRE1 MJ Mac Clancy, Physics 1\nDear Sir\nOne could write at great\nlength filling in the very biased\nhistory of Palestine and Israel in\nthe article \" Study in the Shadow\nof the Gun\"( FELIX578), but Is hall restrict this letter to\nproviding a little information about Bir Zeit University.\nUnder the Jordanian occupation from 1948 to 1967 there were\nno universities in Judea and Samaria, and the Jordanian authorities refused to grant university status to any institution seeking it. However, under\nIsraeli administration since 1967,\nadvances have been made in the\neducational field, and these are\nnow two full-fledged universities\nand two colleges in Judea and\nSamaria.\nBir Zeit, a secondary school\nduring most of the Jordanian\noccupation was accorded university status in 1973. Since then, its\nstudent body has risen to 1,500.\nTwo years ago, approval was\ngiven for the opening of new\nfaculties, the enlargement of the\nboard of governors and a large\nscale building programme.\nThe institution enjoys complete academic freedom. There\nis no interference in its programme of studies and no administrative restrictions are\nimposed on the running of its day\nto day affairs.\nThe FELIX article states that\nOrder No854 issued by the West\nBank Military Governor in July1980 aimed to curb the academic\nfreedom and enable the occupation authorities to interfere to an unprecedented extent. In view of\nthe fact that Jordanian law applicable in the area included\nno provision for the establishment or funding of universities\nand in order to avoid a legal\nvacuum, the Israeli Authorities\ndecided to provide a legal and\nadministrative framework for the\nfunctioning of universities, similar to those existing with respect to universities throughout\nthe world.\nA committee of legal and educational experts considered\nvarious forms of legislation and\nchose to amend the Jordanian\nEducation and Culture Law( No\n16) 1964 by extending its application to universities in the Area,\nthereby preferring to maintain\nlocal law rather than introducing\nnew legislation, or rely upon the\nmore rigorous government supervisory provisions of the\nAmman University Law. Order No854 thus extends the\napplication of the Jordanian law\nto the institutions for higher education set up in the area since\nthe commencement of the Israeli\nAdministration. On the basis of\nIsrael's obligations under International Law to ensure public\norder and safety, considerations\nof public order were added to the\ncri tieria for granting licences for\nthe establishment of educational\ninstitutions. Similarly, the possibility of considering convict ion for security offences or administrative detention was\nadded to the criteria for appointing or transferring teachers, and\na system of entry permits was\ninstituted in order to prevent\ninfiltration into universities and colleges by those paid and instructed to disrupt the educational system and advocate violence.\nTours faithfully\nPeter Cooper, CE3 Maurice Axelrod, Physics 3\nPage 2 FELIX, March 6,1981\n\n"

    "content": "Snee's Titbits\nBeer Prices Stay Down!!\nLast Thursday the Refectory Committee decided\nnot to implement any Bar price rises, despite the\nfact that trade is less than at the same time last\nyear. This is part of the overall decline in the\nbrewing industry as people can't afford to drink as\nmuch as they used to, and our bars are suffering\nalong with outside pubs.\nHowever Bar Committee unanimously felt that\nprice increases would only serve to drive custom\naway to local pubs, or altogether, and therefore\nnot increase our total trade. Brewers increases\nhave already taken place this term, and the\nbudget is likely to bring more but these apply to\nus and local pubs alike \u2014 we felt it most\nimportant not to add any price rises of our own\nwhich would narrow the price gap between us\nand local pubs.\nWith the aid of a survey of local pub prices\n(carried out by Marshalls on the Field Cup!), John\nand I persuaded Dr Sch roter, Refectory Committee Chairman, NOT to propose a2p per\npint price rise to the Committee, which I think\nshows what can be achieved by working together.\nHowever we must not get complacent, and the\nonly way to keep our prices down is to use our\nCollege Bars. At present outside pubs are 7-15p per pint more expensive, and the more people\nwho use our bars, the less likely that this gap will\nnarrow.\nThe Ba r Committee is always willing to\nconsider suggestions for improvement, so if you\nhave any bright ideas, come and tell me about\nthem, or have a chat to one of our Committee\nmembers responsible for monitoring the bars,\nnamely Rich Archer (in the Union Bar) and Roy\nFrancis (Southside).\nRape Alarm Prices Down!\nI have found an alternative supplier for personal\nrape alarms and am expecting a delivery soon.\nThey will be available from the Union Office for\n\u00a32.50.\nFree Prescriptions\nAS THE LAST meeting of the Health Services\nUser's Committee Dr Haines pointed out that\nstudents can obtain their prescriptions free of\ncharge. This is worked out on the basis of\nwhether the individual has less than \u00a320 per week\nto live on, having paid rent for that week. Should\nyou fall into the category please pop along to the\nHealth Centre and gather up the relevant form. I have a few here in the office and I will try to get\nsome more as soon as possible. If you need\nprescriptions on at regular intervals season\ntickets can be purchased. These cost \u00a35.50 for\nfour months or \u00a315 a year. This is well worth it\nconsidering that each prescription now costs \u00a31.\nPlease remember to vote on Monday and\nTuesday and don't forget about the U GM on\nThursday, March 12 at 1:00pm in the Great Hall.\nAll for now.\nSoc Soc\nHARRY YOUNG went to Moscow in 1922 as the\nofficial representative of the British Young\nCommunist League.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nCarlisle visits College\nThe timely Conservative Society invitation for the Secretary of\nState for Education, the Rt Hon Mark Carlisle, MP to visit the\nCollege gave overseas students an op pur t unity to discuss the\ndifferential fees issue.\nMr Carlisle said: \" One regrets having to make the decision to\nintroduce 'full cost' fees for overseas students but their numbers had\ngrown to such a size that it cost over \u00a3100m per year merely to\nsub sid is e their fees.\n\" The Labour Government tried reducing the quota but it didn't work.\nThe result was a totally in desc rim in ate choice of students without\nenquiries into their financial situation. We thought that it was right to\ndo away with in desc rim in ate subsidies.\n\" I would like to give more individual assistance to students from\nparts of the world that one wants to help but it is not easy to decide\nwho should have the top priority. British dependents or students from\nCyprus, who have not home universities, or people from the developing\nworld all deserve consideration.\"\nMr Carlisle disputed the London Student Conference's findings that\noverseas students provide a net inflow of \u00a332m, commenting, \"the\nOverseas Student Trust have stated that there was no validity in the\nfigure of \u00a332m or that overseas students will enhance our economic\nsituation in future. In the end it comes down to the question \u2014 what\ncan we do to help political needs?\"\nBesides hearing questions on overseas student fees, Mr Carlisle gave\na general talk on British Education. He linked the future of industry\nchanges of attitudes in education. \" We must emphasise the importance\nof mathematics and science. More girls should be encouraged to take\nengineering rather than persuaded at the age of fourteen that the\nsubject is not for the m\".Mr Carlisle concluded by saying:\" Imperial College is an\namalgamation of three colleges, the Royal College of Science, the\nRoyal School of Mines, and City and Guilds. That combination is a marriage which not only succeeds at Imperial but is a marriage\nnecessary lor the success of British industry as a whole\".\nHairline Causes\nControversy\nDave Gayor, City and Guilds\nPresident, had his hae d totally\nshaved on Sunday in the Union\nBar, at the Guilds Election Bar\nnight.\nMr Gayor told FELIX that he\nconsidered having his head\nshaved to be well worth it, as\n\u00a3300 had been collected for Rag.\nEven with his head shaved he did\nnot look as funny as Rich Archer.\nA lady friend of Dave's expressed\na favourable opinion on his new\n'clean cut' appearance, although\nin general the \" Mr Smooth\"\nimage has met with mixed\nreaction.\nStar Man at IC\nPatrick Moore, Britain's most famous amateur astronomer, gave a lecture about the planet Mars in the Physics Dept. last Friday evening .\nThe lecture organised by the recently reformed Astronomical Soc, was\nwell attended and included a general question session.\nAfter a brief guide to the conditions on the planet of the solar system, a historical outline of the astronomical observations of Mars was\ngiven. Dr. Moore outlined every-thing from Percival Lowell' s famous 'canals' to the recent\nViking mission. This has dispelled\nthe commonly held opinion that\nMars could support at least\nprimitive vegetation. The planet is\nnow known to be a small, arid\nworld with a tenuous atmosphere\nwhich could not support life as we\nknow it.\nHowever, he concluded with an\nappraisal of the possibility of\ncolonizing Mars. Of all the planets\nit appears that Mars would best\nsuit a self supporting human colony living in an enclosed environment.\nWhen asked by FELIX about his\nregular appearance on the BBC's Sky At Night programme he\nquipped, \"I 'll stay on as long as\nthey'll have me!\"\nPatrick Moore was 58 on Wednesday.

Besides the inefficient use of labour, Mr MacGregor outlined the other\nweaknesses that led to BSC losses, he emphasised that the cost of energy\nwas greater than those of its competitors because plants were closed at\nweekends requiring a heating up period at the start of the week.\n\"Continuous working is essential.\"\n\" In future BSC needs to become competitive. It is of prime importance to get costs down to the other competitors levels by vigorous\nmarketing and reducing the inefficient use of labour. Looking further\ninto the 80s; some experts predict a scarcity in steel coinciding with a growth in the economy and the level of productivity,\" he said.\nThe Lord Flowers commented that BSC's problems were immense\nbut the prospects were encouraging.\nSir Derek Ezra proposed a vote of thanks to Ian MacGregor:\" We all\nhave a vested interest in BSC and it will undoubtedly be a future\nsuccess\".\nThe lecture was well appreciated b v the large audience who filled\nMe chEng220.

The\ntitle was just reward lor a side\nwhich has played consistently\nwell this season, scoring a total\nof 89 goals while conceding only\n19. Equal top scorers with sixteen\na piece were Malcolm Carr and\nDik Veen man. Out of eight matches played, only four points\nwere dropped away from home.\n(See sports page for match report.)\nDo not go to jail\nCollect \u00a3200\nTHE ICU Monopoly Rag Collection was held last Saturday.\nAbout twenty-three people all\nfrom R CSU took part, and raised\n\u00a3184.01. The top collectors were\na team from Chem2 who collected\nover half the total.\nTo encourage participation breakfast was supplied for RCS l members in the Union Office.\nTraditionally an R CSU event,\ntwo years ago Rae Snee (as RC SVP) decided the event would be\nimproved as a joint C CU event\npaid for by I CRag. As the event\nwas not very successful this year\nit seems likely that control of the\nevent will return to R CSU next\nv ear. Paul Johnson said at the\nR CSU Results U GM that this\nve arI CURa g had effectively\npaid for aRCS U event. FELIX later suggested that by providing\nbreakfast for their members only\nRCS LT were effectively limiting\nentries. This was countered by an\nRCS Exec spokesman who commented that any C CU should be allowed to provide\nfood for their own members as\nthis was an optional part of the\nevent.\nUFC\nReport\nICU FINANCE COMMITTEE met last Thursday to discuss\nmajor claims.\nThe Committee authorised Mines to buy new football and\nrugby shirts. This is the first time\nfor some years that Mines had\nneeded to buy shirts as they have\nbeen donated by industry in the\npast. Caving Club have been\npermitted to buy new ladders to\nreplace a set they had which are\nnow six years old and becoming\nunsafe. The Microcomputer Club( only a year old, but with\nover fifty active members) were\ngiven \u00a3522 for a microcomputer.\nThe Snooker Club were allocated\nenough money to buy their table.\n(On Wednesday House Commit tee gave them the use of the old\nTV Lounge/ I CW A Lounge). Dramsoc can now buy new stage\nlights, which form part of their\nfive year plan. Sailing Club are\nable to buy a new Dinghy as part\nof their five year plan. FELIX was allocated money to buy an\nol f set litho printing machine off\nthe Maths Department. IC Radio can now buy a cassette\nrecorder for outside broadcasts.\nGuilds were given money to have\none of Bo's back wheels repaired.\nTwo students going to an Educational Conference in Zurich were given help with their expenses.\nA proposal that major claims\nshould now be more than \u00a3100\nwas accepted. All claims put to\nthe meeting were agreed to and\none UFC member commented\nthat there was, perhaps, a lack of\nquestioning on some items.\nOccupational\nHazard\nSTUDENTS FROM colleges\nthroughout London have begun\nan occupation at Senate House,\nthe administrative centre of\nLondon University.\nAbout forty students are\noccupying the ground floor as a protest against the Government's policy on Overseas Student fees.\nDuring the week, students at LSE and Queen Mary College also\nstaged protests at their own colleges, and the sit in at\nUniversity College is continuing,\nmore than a week after it began. It\nseems possible that UMIST will\nstage lightning strikes and Sheffield University may also\nhave a sit-in. Students currently\ninvolved with the London sit-in\nasked this week for support from\nIC students, either by assisting\nwith the current protest, or\nstarting another.\nFELIX, March 6, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "What's On\nBrunt of the Runt\nDave Musk er has quit in his bid for President\nof ICU. He seems to share similar views to\nmyself on a number of Union affairs, yet he\noffered no solutions and now he has backed\ndown. He didn't even have the courtesy to\ninform me of his stand down so his manifesto\ncould be deleted. Or perhaps all he ever\nintended was to air his views in public on a Presidential platform without putting in the\namount of work normally required of a Presidential candidate.\nIam glad he has stood down, his kind of\npur ile rambling without the backup of a determined character to see his complaints of\nthe Union corrected, deserves only contempt.\nmnm mm From the present state of the music store, it is\nclear that there isn't enough room there for the\nchoir to store all the equipment they would like\nto. This was brought home to them when they\nneeded a grand piano for a rehearsal, but the\nonly one available was at the back of the store,\nwedged in behind all kinds of other accoutrements (see diagram).\nAs if this wasn't enough of a problem, there\nare two things complicating their predicament\neven further.\nFirstly, there's no room to rotate any of the\nobjects without damaging them, so the choir\nwill have to get the piano out by sliding things\nbackwards and forwards without turning them\nround.\nAnd secondly, there's an officious security\nregulation which prohibits them from moving\nanything out of the store (i.e. off the shaded\narea) unless they are going to use it, and the\nonly thing they need to use is the grand piano.\nThe choir are now trying to work out how to\nget that grand piano out of the store in the\nfewest possible moves. Any offers of help?\n(Each move allows you to shift any one object.)\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. \u00a35 and\ntwo tickets to the choir concert will go to the\nsolution which uses fewest moves.\nBir Zeit Controversy\nI have received a number of letters (all but\none past the copy deadline) on the UN Society\narticle last week entitled \"Study in the Shadow\nof the Gun\". Some of the correspondents seem to take\nthe line that FELIX is in support of the article. I should like to remind you that ALL clubs and\nsociety articles express ONLY their own views.\nI do not agree with all articles printed in FELIX submitted in such a manner. If I only published\nwhat I agreed with, that would be censorship.\nI realise the article was lengthy, but this\nshould not be taken as support for it by\nFELIX \u2014 the writer felt he could not express\nhimself in less words.\nI have no opinions myself on the article that I wish to express in the pages of FELIX, except\nthat I would strongly defend their right to\nexpress their own views.\nCopy Deadline\nPeople seem to be forgetting that the\nFELIX copy deadline for ALL copy is 5:30pm Monday. With less people working on FELIX now due to exams this deadline will have to be\nenforced to a greater extent. If you hand in\narticles late then I'm afraid that it's just tough\nt itty. V.

    "content": "Compiled by Phil Webb\nResufes: Wednesday, February 25,1981\nFootball\nIC2 nd Xiv UCL340 IC3rdXI v UCL214 IC5thXI v UCL5100 Hockey\nICl st XIv Charing Cross 4-0\nLadies v Royal Holloway 1-10\nvw vw vw wu wv v wu wwv vw vw Snooker\nALAS, the B team didn't play last week and as a result there was a distinct lack of excitement\nand thrills.\nHowever the A team and C team played and\nthey tried hard to make up for the B team's absence. The A team travelled to Bedford\nCollege and played under trying conditions.\nThe bar was miles away, the table was so dirty\nthat they could have grown potatoes on it. The\nA team still gave a good account of themselves\nby winning 4-1. The C team won against L SEA team by 3 frames to 2. This was rather a poor\nresult for us and the C team are gradually but\nsurely slipping down the league.\nFootball Seconds\nIC made heavy weather of disposing of UC Thirds and it was certainly doubtful as to\nwhether a40 score line was a true reflection\non the game. After taking an early two goal\nlead IC relaxed and allowed UC to build\nattacks, any of which could easily have\nled to a goal. IC's first goal came when\nWiggins fired his shot from the edge of the\nbox into the corner of the net. A couple of\nminutes later, one of a string of corners was\ncleared only to be pumped back towards\nLakin who beat the offside trap and then the\nkeeper to give IC a two nil lead.\nWith about twenty minutes to go, IC started\nto produce the football that has put them near\nthe top of the league. Hartland continued his\nimpressive scoring record for the seconds\nwhen he beat the advancing keeper with a fine\nshot and the game was finally made safe when\nArmstrong took advantage of confusion in the\nUC defence, with a shot from inside the box.\nTEAM: Williams, Dunhill, Beer, Armstrong,\nGriffiths, Lakin, Lay, Wiggins, Hartland,\nVeenman, Saunders\nResults: Saturday, February 28,1981\nFootball\nIC 1st XI V St Thomas Hosp 7-1\nIC 3rd XI V QM C10 IC4thXI V QM C53 IC 5th XI V Q MC42I C6 th XIV St Thomas Hosp 3-1\nHockey\nIC 1st XI V Barts 3-2\nIC2 nd XIV Birkbeck Coll 6-0\nFootball Sixths\nTHE Sixths travelled south to Cobham on\nSaturday for what was, on paper, their most\ndifficult match of the season.\nThe Sixths started confidently, within one\nminute Chamberlain had won a corner, following which Roche received the ball in\nthe area and smashed it in. Inspired by Flynn\nwho made an impressive debut the Sixths\nbegan to play some good football. The second goal was not long in coming, Martin's through ball found Haberlin unmarked in the\npenalty area, who crashed the ball into the\nnet. Roche scored the sixths third goal when\nhe latched on to Tinkler's pass and flicked the\nball tant ali singly into the net. With the defence; Higham, Bradley, Ha berlin, Gartside, and Flynn more than equal to the St\nThomas' attack IC were able to continue\npressing forward. The one chance St Thomas' had in the first half was ably saved\nby Hampton.\nThe second half was more even. St\nThomas' relied heavily on two fast forwards\nand long drop kicks from their goalkeeper but\nthese tactics proved ineffective against the\nSixths defence. St Thomas' did score early in\nthe second half when a free kick skimmed off\nHaberlin's head and skidded past the luckless\nHampton After this setback the Sixths reclaimed their hold on the game and Martin\nand Coussens both narrowly failed to increase\nthe Sixths lead. St Thomas' showed they\nweren't going to give in easily when they hit\nthe post but minutes later Chamberlain's shot\njust missed and Tinkler watched his shot fly\njust wide. At the end of the game the Sixths\nhad won three-one and put themselves in a very good position to win the league.\nTEAM: Hampton, Higham, Bradley,\nHaberlin, Flynn, Tinkler, Martin, Gartside,\nCoussens, Roche, Chamberlain, Caseau.\nSailing\nTHE team was in Southampton on Saturday\nand was crushing ly defeated by a very strong\nopposition. To make matters worse, Southampton who would probably beat IC at the\n\"Harp\", were sailing their own boats (G.P.14's) on Southampton Waters.\nHowever it was not a completely wasted\nday. Once the team had lost its league points,\nthe sailing conditions being nothing short of\nexcellent, numerous \"friendlies\" were sailed.\nThis gave the IC team the opportunity to get a measure of the boats (for next year?).\nTEAM: Allport, Chadwick, Mills, Murray,\nRedman, Younghusband.\nHockey Seconds\nA very successful afternoon for the Second XI\nwas marred only by the reluctance of certain\nplayers to score hattrick s! Due to the absence of captain and X ray specialist Mas om, Gray elected to play himself at\nsweeper With this thought in mind, the IC\nforwards started in search of a few quick\ngoals. Despite intense early pressure and\nnear misses by Cornwell and St roomer Birkbeck held out and it began to look as if\nGray might get a touch of the ball! Finally\nCornwell rounded the keeper and slammed\nthe ball home to open the scoring. Shortly\nafterwards Chew scored the second from a short corner, the ball taking almost as many\ndeflections as Pete Hughes has had green\ncards!\nThe end of the first half saw some excellent\nhockey from IC with flowing moves down\nboth sides of the pitch. However, half-time\nwas taken with the score still 2-0. It didn't stay\nthat way for long; Garms, obviously inspired\nby the half-time talk, took eighteen seconds\nto score the first of his two goals. These were\nsplit by a penalty, just about converted by\nChew! Then the forward line was thrown into\ntotal confusion by the sight of full-back Mike\nClift gleefully charging down the pitch in a way that gave a totally new meaning to the\nterm \"dummy run\"! After we had recovered,\nthere was just time for Dave Cornwell to make\nthe final score 6-0 with a well taken goal.\nTEAM: Jones, Gray, Clift, Pound, Rao,\nStroomer, Chew, Garms, Afilaka, Cornwell,\nMitchell, Shaw (Umpire).\nFootball Fourths\nAFTER a reshuffle of the side the fourths\narrived at Ditchley with eleven players, three\nwho were making their first appearance for the\nFourths.\nIC were on top from the start and soon took\nthe lead after a good run from Buckley who\ngave a good pass to Dolan who scored from a narrow angle. Five minutes later IC went two\nnil up after an excellent dive from Hartland\nwith Buckley scoring from the resulting penalty. IC went close several more times in\nthe first half Griffiths particularly unlucky not\nto score with a close range header but at half\ntime the score was 2-0.\nQM C scored a shock goal early in the\nsecond half a long range shot just beating\nVeats in goal. Soon after Milner was unlucky to\ngive away a penalty. Fortunately the over\nenthusiastic QM C penalty taker placed this\nwell over the bar. IC got their third goal after\nDavies chased a through ball from Saunders\nand scored with a well placed shot. QM C quickly pulled back another goal while the IC\ndefence wasn't looking, before Maddy placed\na good shot to put IC 4-2 up. QM C were again\nallowed back into the game when they were\nawarded a penalty after a firm challenge from\nChown. Veats did well to reach t ne penalty\nbut couldn't quite stop it! IC finished of the\ngame with Hartland finally getting a goal in.\nTEAM: Veats, Milner, Maddy, Griffiths,\nChown, Abedajo, Buckley, Dolan, Davies,\nHartiund, Saunders.\nPS: Thanks to all those non-regular fourths\nwho played for us.\nPat Chown\nJ WWW WWW WWW WWW WW Results: Sunday, March 1,1981\nFootball\nIC 1st XI v Q MC41I C2 nd XIv QM C61 Football Seconds\nIN THIS CRUCIAL last match of the season,\nthe seconds got off to a fine start, playing\nsome devastating football which had Q MC's defence in terrible trouble. Saunders' impressive dive persuaded the referee to\naward a penalty which was converted by\nBeer, hitting his shot firmly into the corner of\nthe net for a10 lead. The second quickly\nfollowed when Saunders completed a good\nmove from the right with a shot from close\nrange. As usual, IC then relaxed a little and\nenabled QM C to work some dangerous moves, although Lay hit a marvellous curling\nshot into the top right hand corner to make it\n3-0. QM C struck back however to make it 3-1\nand at half-time, the game was certainly not\nsafe. Within the first minute of the second half\nthough, Hartland had made it 4-1 and IC's fifth from Veenman followed soon after. A good, if somewhat patchy performance, was\ncapped when Hartland turned elegantly on\nthe edge of the box and fired his shot inside\nthe near post to make the final score 6-1.\nMy thanks to all those who have played for\nthe seconds during the season and to those,\nwhose hard work in organising the Football\nClub, has made everything possible.\nTwo major factors in the teams success\nwere the Club's strength in depth which enabled the Seconds to field a very strong\nside on every occasion, and the tremendous\nspirit that made playing in the team such an\nenjoyable occupation.\nTEAM: A Williams, S Dunhill, J Beer, M Armstrong, P Lakin, D Griffiths, J Lay, R Wiggins, D Veenman, A Hartland, D Saunders.\n(Since you've won your league, Jim - I 'll let\nyou include teams initials this week - Ed.)\nFEUX, March 6,1981 Page 7\n\n"
