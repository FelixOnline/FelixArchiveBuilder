    "content": "Music Felix \u2022 6 December 1999\nfrequency\nTrancenfral\n@ The Pleasure Rooms\nIt was by word of mouth that this night first came\nto my attention, and with the enthusiasm that\ncame with the recommendation I know it's gonna\nbe as to rmer. So off we go. We get to the door\nand security seems a bit too aggressive for my li k ing. The twelve-pound entrance fee also seemed\na bit much, but at this point we still didn't really\nknow what was to come.\nInside now and there's a long corridor occupied\nby a long and slow moving line of people edging\ntowards the cloak room. Forget that then, lets just\nscope out the place. The main corridor ends and\nwidens into a what seems to be a nice and not too\nloud kind of meeting place. However, the four\nwalls surrounding it have entrances to potentially\nfilthy and dirty acid techno and hard trance. Brilliant. Some like-minded friends have mentioned\nthat some well-known DJs are playing today.\nThey're not wrong. Posted on the doors, the lineups consist of sets from Trancentral residents\nOrange Peel, Zebedee, plus regular favourites\nDave the Drummer, John Little, Chris Liberator\nand more. We are also being treated to a live set\nby special guests Punk Floyd and some funky\nflavours from some live bands in the chill out\nroom, including Frontside. Of course, now we've\nbeen here a while, the night is going to start getting better and better, and, oh yeah - very messy.\nNice - this is what the weekends were made for.\nNow it's somewhere between 3 and 4am, and\nPunk Floyd have just started. One of the other\nnon-chill out rooms (Room 2) is being rushed (!)\nwith c lubbers in anticipation of the music getting\nharder and darker. And how! Orange Peel is\nrocking the main room with his down-right filthy\nacid techno, and I find my self dancing on a table\nwith my good friend Mark. At 5am it's all gone a bit twisted, but of course we still love it. Then finally it's six and I'm off to the after party for some\nmore monkeying around. Nice.\nKesh\nBotchit & Scarper @ The Junction\nBotchit and Scarper, the Bristol based big beat boys, presented this showcase of Nu-skool breaks and mixed-up\nbeats at that well-known club, The Junction. Err, when I say\nwell known, I actually mean not well known, and I don't think anyone can blame me for not having run into it\nbefore. The downside to this place is that, for anyone living North of the river, it's a bit out of the way. Once you\nget to Brixton tube, right at the end of the Victoria line, it's a further 20 minutes walk down the notorious Coldharbour Lane. From the outside, the club looked a bit desert-ed. There was nobody about (ominous compared to the\nbustle of Brixton), the windows were boarded up and the\ndoor was firmly shut. But there was definitely some distinctive melodies floating out from within, so we investigated further...\nHappily, we were not disappointed. Once inside, we were\ngreeted with a warm, cosy atmosphere, lots of friendly\nfaces, and extremely loud music. The interior is painted a deep red, and there are plenty of large, comfy leather\nsofas to relax into before launching yourself onto the\ndance floor. The drinks were pricey (\u00a32.50 for a small bottle of lager), but we weren't there to get wasted, it was for\nthose rhythms that just make you want to move those\ndancing feet.\nAnd what rhythms they were! Enormous tribal beats hammered home by the powerful sound system made all the\npeople lose it. Crazy dancing, throwing themselves all\nover the place, for the shear joy of it. There were no inhibitions. The place is small, producing an intimate atmosphere that makes it feel like you're with a bunch of your\nmates. The lighting was fantastic for such a small room,\npainting multi coloured tiger stripes across gyrating figures,\ncreating a living, breathing, work of art.\nThis wasn'ta big, high profile super-club, but I had just as\ngood a time thanks to the unique atmosphere that such a small place can produce. It even smelled nice! The music\nwas very alternative, and although I was sceptical at first,\nthe intense bass lines soon won me over and I was up\nthere with the rest of them. DJ Freq Nasty was the star of\nthe night. The Junction has opened up a new genre to me.\nGood fun all round.\nTom\nRecommended\nClubbing\nSo, as the festive season dawns and we all get\na chocolate every morning, there is no\nexcuse for not clubbing your socks off at one\nof the many clubs recommended by the lovely lady above.\nMonday 6th December\nTHIS @ Bar Rhumba; \u00a34\nGilles Peterson and company are the hosts of\nthis night that seems to get better and better\nas the years go by.

We are in the throws of\npreparing for our dramatic/musical\nextravaganza of the year, with the\nICSM Light operatic society presenting Crazy For You, which runs from\nMonday 6th December until Friday\n10th December in the Rec Centre\n(behind Wilson House). This event\npromises to be fantastically enter-tai ning, and we are following it up\nwith the Soiree on the Saturday. This\nis an age old St Mary's tradition\nwhich has been rejuvenated by the\nhard work of Tom Burchell and the\nOperatic Society. It is an evening of\nhilarity and entertainment incorporating music and drama of every\ntype you can imagine.\nNumerous other events have\nbeen happening in the clubs and\nsocs world, from musical concerts\nto bops and cocktail nights. We had\na very successful bonfire party following the Interyear Rugby match at\nTeddington on the 6th of November\n(which, of course, the second years\nwon, as seems to happen every\nyear). Other clubs seem to be flourishing from what I hear, and sports\nare as ever keeping up their tradition of success. We want to particularly point out the success of the 1 st\nICSM Rugby team, who we wish lots\nof luck in the new year, with their\ntrip to Cork to take part in the European Cup.\nA lot has been going on within\nthe medical school itself. The\nUnion, in conjunction with the powers that be, are looking into the\nissues of transport and the amount\nit can cost to travel to clinical\nattachments in the district general\nhospitals. We hope to collate all\ninformation by the new year and\npresent a case to the relevant bod-ies. There is also the ongoing concern regarding the future of the\nmain base clinical sites - at the\nmoment we are particularly aware\nof the problems at Charing Cross,\nwith the threatened library relocation and the potential consequences of such a proposal. The\nstudents and the Union are following developments very closely, and\nwe are adamant that we will not be\nlosing out facilities!\nA quick run down of events until\nthe end of term:\nOpera 6th10 th Dec\nSoiree 1 1 th Dec\nCarol Service 13th Dec 7pm Bop at Charing Cross 1 5th Dec\nWinter Ball 18th Dec\nI'm sure other events will spring up\nas the term draws to a close, as\nChristmas always provokes spontaneous ideas!

Paxman ahoy.\nSome notice abl Refurbishment at last for Southside\nMANSO OR CH OUDH URY Southside Halls may undergo a refurbishment this coming summer if\nplanning permission is received for a massive remodelling of the building.\nEvery room in the block (which\npresently houses the FalmouthKeogh, Selkirk and Tizzard Halls) will\nbe renovated, with every room set to\nbe fitted with en-suite bathrooms.\nAccording to the College's long-term planning and investment an aly sis, this feature is essential if the College hopes to rent rooms during the\nvacations for conference attendees.\nOther possible improvements to\nSouthside could lead to an increase\nin social space for hall residents and\nan improvement in the ratio of students to kitchens. The new halls will\nbe vertical (ie based around a few\neight storey staircases) rather than\nhorizontal (as is currently the case),\nand landings will thus be re-mod-el led to increase the number of\nrooms and cooking facilities.\nAll this will come at a price,\nhowever - there will probably be an\nincrease in rent of around \u00a36.50 per\nweek from the current amount. Students could therefore be looking at\na total increase of over \u00a3200 per\nyear for their living expenses.\nIan Clifford, ICU Deputy President (Finance & Services), said\nSouthside was in genuine need of\nrefurbishment, as the current building was never intended to be a permanent residence. Mr Clifford further noted that \"students are more\nlikely to take care of their hall if it's Southside Photo: Archive\nnew and shiny\" and that if the renovation plans do not go ahead,\nSouthside would probably stay in its\ncurrent dilapidated condition for the\nnext thirty years.\nIn Brief\nDEBT COLLECTORS\nCHASE STUDENTS\nMiddlesex University has chosen to\nemploy a debt-collecting firm to\nobtain unpaid tuition fees in an\naction that could set a precedent.\nChase Debt Collectors, Manchester, are primarily to pursue any\noverseas and post-graduate students who default on their fees, but\nit is understood that they are to\nextract money from undergraduates too. The new scheme has\napparently caused a few administrative headaches as non-payers\nare still allowed to attend classes,\nhave work marked and sit exams.\nCINEMA DISCOUNTS Felix has secured a deal whereby\nstudents will be able to see discounted films at the Kensington\nOdeon. The scheme will let students watch any film they want for\nno more than \u00a34.50 and will be\nrunning from Monday to Friday.\nThis is a definite improvement on\nthe deal for students currently running at Virgin, Fulham Road, which\nruns from Monday to Thursday and\ncosts \u00a35 per film.\nThis agreement pre-em pts a similar student discount, which has\nbeen arranged by the Union, with\nWarner Brothers. This deal currently operates for students with the\nNUS, of which IC is famously not a member. The discount, as it currently stands, is \u00a33 for any film\nevery day, excluding the cinemas at\nLeicester Square. This discount will\nbe nation-wide whereas the\nOdeon scheme will be restricted to\none cinema only. However, the\nOdeon discount will have started\non Friday the 3rd of December\nwhile the Warner Brothers scheme\nis still in the production and printing phase. In addition to this, by\ngetting hold of a booklet from the\nFelix office, you can take advantage of various extra offers from\nOdeon. See Screen for further\ndetails.\nCOURTS COST ICU societies wishing to use the\ntennis courts will now be charged\n\u00a35 per hour for the booking of\nboth courts. The price comes as a shock to those at IC who have\nbeen used to playing for free. The\nCollege has introduced the new\npricing system, after taking over\nmanagement of the courts from the\nUnion when the courts fell into a state of disrepair last year. Originally under Union control, charges\nwere only made to external users -for example, schools and the pub-li c. Tim Trailor, Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), explained\nthat in return for lost revenue from\nexternal court bookings, the College will pay ICU approximately\n\u00a34500 per year - a figure based\non the average taking previously\nreceived from tennis court book-in gs. After a ten thousand pound\ngrant from the Harlington Trust to\nfund refurbishment of the courts,\nthey are now up to a reasonably\nhigh standard. It has been suggested that tennis court revenue might\nnot be as high as expected, due to\nthe deterring cost of play. However,\nthe compensation from College\nshould ensure that the Union will\nnot lose out.\nBOOK DISCOUNTS This Thursday will see Waterstones'\nsecond \"Discount Thursday\", targeted at soaking up the pre-Christ-mas market. All books (including\nacademic text-books) are available\nat a15% reduction on the normal\nretail price from every branch in the\nLondon area - including all three\ncampus branches.\n\n"

    "content": "Music Felix \u2022 6 December 1999\nfrequency\nCalamari and Phaser\n@ Hope and Anchor, Islington\nOf all the Imperial bands named after dishes at the local bubble restaurant, Cala mari are the best. Easily! They\nw upped the pants off Phaser, the so called headline act.\nThe arse-crack, belly and monotone drone of their front-man,(I hesitate to use the term \"singer\"), was plenty to put\nyou off. The other support act advertised had a nasty chill,\nso failed to show up. The venue was your typical downstairs-at-a boozer set up. A stage around the size of a postage stamp could barely\naccommodate our boys. A strong show in too small avenue affected the balance on occasions. Very few IC students could manage to drag themselves over to Islington\nto lend their support, so there was just enough room to dance around your handbag. If that's your thing.\nAll in all, Cala mari put on a creditable show. Starting with\nIfs Hard, their set of 8 carefully crafted songs easily filled\nthe half hour slot allocated, and you weren't left looking at\nyour watch. Everything was impressively anchored by the\nrhythm department, courtesy of Alec and Martin, but the\nmelodious inputs of Alex( vox) and Mat( geeta r) still had chance to shine. Last Tear was an attempted change in\ntempo, but came across as a bit ponderous. Max the Bugbear (sic) was chance for the popstars in the making to\ndance with their womenfolk( cringe). Alec( stuck behind his\nbig kit) missed out here. There were some hints of The Barenaked Ladies ( homeboys), a bit of Reef (wild) and Jam ira quai( funky) which all seemed to gel wickedly. Later\non two similar songs went back to back: it's not always wise to do this (especially if they're in the same key) but\nreally there wasn't much else to criticise!\nThe brooding Never Look Back and This Life finished their\nset and you sensed they had plenty in reserve. A sincere\nperformance. Nice to see indie rock types obviously enjoying being upon stage - too many of them have the charisma of a dollop of crusty tarama salat a. In short, Phaser are the kind of band to give grassroots\nindie a bad name. Cala mari are your intelligent alternative. Listen out for them. Maybe next time they gig, you should stir from your torpor and go see em. Ian\nJazz and Rock Soc Gig @ dBs, ICU\nA couple of Thursdays ago, dBs resounded to the sound of a number of the best\nbands in College playing their hearts out to a near capacity audience. The packed venue was buzzing with energy as the first act took to the stage and I indulged in a colourful drink of some kind. Rocky and Bullwinkle are actually something rather different to normal just two people on( mostly) acoustic guitar. But what a performance! War ul was very imp res sive with a very emotionally charged voice, giving moving renditions of songs by the\nlikes of Radiohead and REM. Ably assisted by Will, this was a very good performance, with the encore of Black Star finishing off the set perfectly.\nAnother band, another intriguingly monicker ed cocktail! Second on stage were Resist, a band with a unique sound, playing original songs. The darkened stage set\nthe scene perfectly for their style of music, with barely more than the luminescence from some fairy lights wrapped around their amps and microphone. They describe the mse lv es as playing' gothic psychedelic pop' which is probably as close as you'll\nget, but think Radiohead meets Garbage in a not-really-dance y but-loads a FX\nkinda way. The atmosphere was intense, the band giving a great performance, especially from the singer, Dave, and the guitarist, Ash. My only criticisms would be\nthat the songs were drawn out a little too much and the effects need to be used a little more carefully. Otherwise an excellent gig and I'm sure we'll see them on stage\nagain soon. As a very odd smelling blue cocktail arrived, on came band three - Soul Doubt. Introduced by the effectively incoherent ramblings of the com per e, they launched into a particularly energetic and tight set of covers. All of the band were obviously enjoying themselves, and this enthusiasm carried over into the audience. Highlights were Celebrity Skin and More Than Words, where singer, Emily, and guitarist, Nigel, gave a great performance. This was a great debut gig and testament to the hard work they must have put into rehearsals. A few pints later and on came the final band of the night. One of the more established bands at College, Ticket have built up a justly deserved reputation as a very\ntight and skillful outfit. With the addition of guitarist Spencer, they've really filled out their sound and tonight we were treated to a fine performance including many original songs, taking full advantage of their headlining slot. A faultless gig, they got the whole of dBs into their 7 0 s psychedelic groove, with Steve ' sounds more like\nPaul Weller than Paul Weller' Reece as excellent as ever on vocals and guitar, the\nrest of the band merely being extremely good! A treat.\nAll in all a great night featuring a lot of talent, especially in the form of bands doing their debut gig at IC. It seemed like everyone in the near capacity crowd had a great\ntime and hopefully this will set a precedent for the next Jazz and Rock society gig on December9 th. Be there - you don't know what you're missing and what's more it's free!\nMartin\n\n"

These were undergrads, post\ngrads and their teachers all interested to see how the scheme would\nwork. Sadly for the powers that be,\nmost of those who attended were\nnot born yesterday and there were\nmany flaws in their plan. Like a two\nfloor gap between where the reference texts are kept and the PCs. Or\nthe fact that the department moving\nin actually needs room to expand\nwhich it will not have in these plans.\nThis was news to those there too -where will they expand? Further into\nthe library I guess, as there is nothing else nearby. The quest to try to\nget the students and other users of\nthe library in all this, and to get the\npowers that be to realise that they\ncan't push this mistake through as it\nstands, continues. I would like to\nsee a person from each year and\nfrom each user group involved in\nthe discussion process - at the\nmoment there has been a token\noffer of two students, who will be\nheavily numbered on the commit-tee.\nWarner Brothers\nWell done to Felix for their deal\nwith the local Odeon!

Whilst I wholeheartedly agree that the building is\nin need of a thorough overhaul, I am increasingly doubtful that this\nis the way to go about it. It would\nseem that the College is so desperate for some capital to finance\nthe development that they will do\nanything in return for money - in\nthis case, they are prepared to\nsqueeze two units that blatantly\ncannot fit into the present building\nonto the site, because of a juicy\n\u00a32.5 million carrot that is being\ndangled in front of them. I'm sure\nsimilar stories abound when it\ncomes to decisions made over at\nSouth Ken, with hall renovations\nand the new sports centre just two\nof the more obvious examples.\nThe real problem is that,\nunless someone else comes in with\nan offer of a similar level of invest-ment, the decision is as good as\nmade. Prof Whitehouse insists that\nthe development must (and will) go\nahead, and thus this is the only\nway to make it happen - and to\nhell with the students if they get in\nthe way. It's just another example\nof Imperial College's painfully\nshort-term is t attitude to life. We\nknow that these units will need to\nexpand in the next few years. We\nknow that more and more more\nstudents will be moved out to the\nCharing Cross site, because of\novercrowding in the BMS and the\nsheer size of the Drewe Theatreyet the planners and senior staff\nwill happily spend a massive\namount of taxpayers money on a scheme that completely blocks any\npotential for development.\nThe College frequently talks of\nit's desire to be seen as the \"MIT of\nEurope\", but this will never come\nabout until there is a serious\nchange in attitude. In terms of\nbuildings,, of investment, of\nstaffing and (particularly) in terms\nof funding the College constantly\nbalances itself on a very sharp\nknife-edge, living hand and\nmouth, without any means of sensible long-term investment. Perhaps the appointment of a new\nRector will finally see all this\nchange, but by then, eighteen\nmonths down the line, it could\nalready be too late...\nYours sincerely,\nCharing Cross III\nAND FINALLY...\nDear Sir,\nI would lie k to ask your readers help.

    "content": "6 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Feature 9\nFighting Off Branson and Maxwell\nThe market led Psion to games. Psion had\nstarted off with databases and also produced a program called flight simulator. It must be\nquite satisfying having been there at the birth\nof the computing gaming industry\n'\"We were among the first companies in the\nworld to put a simulation of an aeroplane into\na small microcomputer and look at it as\nthought you were the pilot. It was terrific that\nthere was real aerodynamics in there - we\nactually created the equations to do it all\"\nOther games like Hungary Horace, Horace\nGoes Skiing, and Chequered Flag to name a few, followed. Psion became the number one\nin games in the UK from 1982 to 1983 and\nmade huge profits, and it is those profits that\nformed the capital base of the company. The\nproblem with huge profits is that everybody\nwants a piece of the action. People like\nRichard Branson and Robert Maxwell, with Virgin Games and the Mirror Group respectively,\ngeared up for attack, and this caused Psion to\nchange its strategy - they invested in the much\nlonger term sense and moved towards areas\nwhere the barriers to entry would be much\nhigher.\n\"The question which we asked ourselves is\nwhat are the barriers to entry. Okay, we are\nmaking giant profits - what is to stop others?\nAnd the answer is we couldn't see very much,\nbecause barriers to entry were low. And\nbecause our capital was so much bigger,\nbecause of our success, our resources were\nmuch bigger...we had to move on\"\nThere were two main product lines that Psion\ntargeted: the first (and most obvious) choice\nwas application software for PCs. The other,\nhowever, was a completely radical concept of\na very, very mobile computer. A computer that\nyou could actually slip into your pocket, but\nwhich would manage information. It wasn'ta calculator, it was going to manage information\nand they called it the Organiser to try and\ndescribe that.\nBirth of The Organiser\nSo, Psion created the Organiser, invented it,\nand launched that in 1 984. The most demanding aspect of it's evolution was the software.\n15 years later the evolution of that software is\nnow Symbian, but of it's turned into a giant\nafter all those years. Now Psion Group are on\n32-bit platforms, utilising huge software\nresources and systems. They've done very well\nin understanding the right technologies, and\nthe right software technologies. And that's why\nSymbian is in the prominent position it is.\nOver the years the company has broad-e ned. They've produced the Organiser, and\nthe Organiser II - both hugely successful prod-] PSION COMPUTERS PSION INDUSTRIAI PSION DA COM sym b an\nuc ts that sold in their millions. Then the company migrated to 1 6-bit systems that led to the\nSeries 3 family: the 3A, the 3C, and so on.\n\"We were the first company to produce a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in a highly\nportable computer - It's that which allowed us\nto compete and win against Hewlett-Packard,\nSharp,Casio and Sony.\"\nAnnus Mirabilis\n1998 was a year of significant change for\nPsion. At the beginning of the year Psion was\nunder pressure in it's key palm-top computers.\nA surge of products produced by rivals such as\nPalm and various Windows CE based\nmachines had cut Psion's market share in the\nmarket that it had created. Sales of the new\nSeries 5 had been disappointing, and at the\nbottom of the range the Siena was dropped.\nAdmittedly, Psion had a diminishing share of a wider market and it was still the market leader:\nPsion's share of the the European market\ndropped from around 70 percent to 59 percent during that year, but still one in four palm-tops sold around the world was a Psion.\nFortunately, there is more to Psion than just\npalm-top computers. It is the world's third\nlargest manufacturer of mobile PC modems,\nand sales in that division rose 79% last year as\nthe demand for mobile PC connectivity took off.\nDawn of a new EPOC\nOn the same day that Psion announced a profits warning, it's share price doubled. Why? On\nthat same day Psion announced that it was to\njoin with three of the world's top mobile phone\nmanufacturers to use Psion's EPOC operating\nsystem in a joint venture called Symbian. It is\ncrucial to understand the significance of this.\nOperating system software for wireless telephony is going to be one of the most competitive\nand exciting economic and technological arenas for the next decade and beyond.\nThe current situation is that Europe has the\nlead in mobile telephony. Finland's Nokia is\nthe the world's No 1 cellular phone brand,\nSweden's Ericsson is the number 2, whilst the\nAmerican Motorola is the number three brand.\nThe mobile phone business is exploding: current estimates are that global sales will grow\nfrom current levels of 100 million to 360 million units a year within two years. Just from\nthese basic numbers you can see the reason\nfor the global hyperactivity in the telecom s industry.\nWatch out Europe\nOne of the major reasons Europe leads the\nworld was the adoption of the GSM standard\nfor the second generation of mobile phones\n(which we are currently using) whilst in the\nStates there were many competing techno lo gies. Another reason is social. By 2003, analysts expect much of the Continent to follow the\nexample of Finland, where more than 6 out of\n10 people own cell phones. If that happens,\n248 million Europeans would own them (com-pared with 141 million today). Economies of\nscale could mean that within a decade wireless\ncalls could be cheaper than standard landline\ncalls\nWireless Surfing\nThe main technological driver for the next generation of phones is the fact that the data\nband with that they will be able to handle will\nbe much greater than at present. Naturally, this\nleads you to question why we should be limited to only transmitting voice data. The next\ngeneration of wireless devices will enable users\nto access the internet or exchange email from\na 'hand-held device'. At the moment, there\nfunction of these gizmos is split between two\ndevices: an organiser and mobile phone. In\nthe future there is no reason for these devices\nto remain separate.\nIn my view one of David Potter's major\nachievements has been to strategically place\nhis company at the centre of this new market.\nNokia, Ericsson and Motorola currently\naccount for 75 percent of the world's mobile\nphones. It will be interesting to see how the\ntelecom s companies battle with the computing\ncompanies, each with their hundreds of millions of customers who will increasingly overlap as the boundaries merge. I can't wait to\nsee what happens.\nBashari Bakari\n\n"

    "content": "6 Science Felix \u2022 6 December 1999\nHow to stop a killer\nUp to half a billion people are infected worldwide, and 40 people will die from it while you read this. So what's being\ndone to stop malaria? John Clifford finds out.\nA mosquito bite can be deadly Pictures: Department of Biology\nIt starts off like flu, with shivering and a fever,\nbut generally by then it's too late. Although it\nbegins with a simple mosquito bite, soon the\ndisease progresses to uncontrollable shaking,\nfits and delirium. Even with medical treatment,\nthe patient is doomed to a long debilitating illness which may recur suddenly over periods of\nseveral years, or to become one of the 2 million people who die from malaria every year. It\nis most prevalent in f he tropics, generally in the\ncountries that are least likely to be able to\nafford the huge burden of healthcare or lost\nlabour that malaria entails. But researchers\nworking at the Sir Alexander Fleming building\nare part of the world-wide effort to stop the\nmost deadly of tropical diseases.\nMalaria is caused by one of several tiny parasites\nof the genus Plasmodium, and all research\nfocuses on somehow breaking the cycle of in fec tion. Before laying their eggs, the mosquitoes\ntake a meal of blood from available animals,\nincluding humans. If the human is infected with\nthese single celled parasites, they are able to\nsense when the blood they are in has passed into\nthe mosquito's gut, and as the blood is digested,\nthe cells mature into male and female gametes,\nsense each other and mate. The resulting cell\nmatures into a th ready cell called an o oki net e, which tunnels through the gut wall, where it\ngrows and divides into new forms that invade the\nmosquito's salivary glands, ready to infect the\nliver and blood of the next human bitten.\nThere are three possible approaches against\nmalaria; firstly, you can tackle the vector (the\nmosquitoes). For example, in emergencies, the\nlocal authorities often spray large areas with\npowerful insecticides, and many countries have\na policy of wiping out marshes, lakes, or even\npuddles - anywhere where the insects can\nbreed. However, there are limits to this\napproach. It is not practical to wipe out all\nmosquitoes and all wetlands, and insecticides\ntend to have effects on both human health and\nthe environment. For instance, the effects of\nDDT are well known. However, recent field\nstudies have shown that separating DDT from\npeople by impregnating it into a bed net could\ndramatically cut the rates of transmission - but\nthis system would cost about $ 2 a person,\nwhich is still too much for too many people in\ntoo many countries.\nSecondly, the parasite itself can be attacked\nwith drugs once inside the body. While this\nworks as a treatment, malaria is notoriously difficult to stop, and strains of malaria have\nemerged that are not only resistant to chloroquine (one of the most effective drugs) but\nactually become more infectious when the drug\nis present. New anti-malarial compounds are\nbeing developed, but, as with antibiotics, if they\nare not used sensibly it could be only a matter\nof time before resistance to these develops too.\nThirdly, you can fight the disease by vaccina-tion. However, developing a vaccine is not as\nsimple as it sounds. Firstly, this is because there\nis more than one disease. There is the disease\ncaused by the parasite Plasmodium falc i param( the most dangerous strain) which kills the most\npeople, many of them children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa where it is most prevalent.\nThere is also the parasite P Vivax, which,\nalthough it kills rarely, causes a terrible disease\nwhich totally incapacitates the sufferer. It is a particularly cruel affliction, as the parasite has\nevolved to lie dormant in the liver for months at\na time before recurring over a period of many\nyears. This mechanism allows it to survive\nthrough the winter, when there are no mosquitoes to help it spread.\nThe second problem with developing a vaccine\nis this; the parasite and the immune system\nhave been locked in battle since man first\nevolved, and so it has developed many ways to\nstay one step ahead of the immune system\nwhilst in its host. For example, the immune system works by recognising proteins on the surface of a foreign cell. Malaria, however, has\nevolved to show the immune system hundreds\nof different combinations of proteins, meaning\nthat the body can never learn to recognise them\nall. The pathogen's system of sexual reproduction makes it very good at keeping one step\nahead of its human host.\nOne approach of current vaccine research,\nhowever, consists of imitating not the hundreds\nof proteins that it shows whilst in the body, but\nthe few proteins that the mature male and\nfemale cells use to recognise one another\nwhilst in the mosquito's gut. The theory is this;\nbecause they are still sitting in human blood,\ncontaining human immune cells; if the immune\ncells can be taught to recognise these part icu "

    "content": "26 Games Felix \u2022 6 December 1999\nNo Fear Downhill Mountain Biking (PSX)\nThe No Fear trademark officially endorses Codemasters latest outing\nfor the Playstation. With this in mind, anticipation began to rage inside\nmy mind. Would I become fully integrated into the game, having\nbecome immune to all other sensory stimuli, so that I felt every sump,\njump & bump, or would I be chucking the CD out the window? Boy oh\nboy did I fall for the former. Why? Because this game's as to rmer. There are around 1 1 tracks, each in a different country and with completely different scenery. They range from the streets of San Francisco to\nthe deserts of Morocco and have but one thing in common - they all\ngo downhill. I, of course, failed to appreciate this in my impatience to\nget on my bike and have a go, and duly paid the price as I started my\nfirst race up in Yorkshire. Yep, I pedalled like mad right from the start,\nfailing to realise that you can let gravity do all the hard-work for you. I couldn't understand it when I was panting like mad on the level track at\nthe end, whilst my opponent zoomed past. The trick is to make sure you\npedal at the right time (energy levels are depleted quickly but will recover when you coast along), and also to make sure you brake at the critical moments. You may be good at steering, but fine tuning your braking is essential if you plan to progress, often being the difference\nbetween success and failure. As the words 'No Fear1\nimply, much of the\ntime you will be racing on the brink of control, and this provides an\nincredible rush.\nDepending on your preference you can view the action from behind\nyour character or from the handlebars. If you choose the latter then you\nwill turn your body perfectly in tune with your bike, and wince when you\nsee a tree coming straight your way. It is this level of immersion that\nmakes this game great, with good quality visuals and audio unlocking\nthe stored potential.\nThere is much lasting appeal in this game. Not all the tracks are available at the beginning - you'll need to complete some to open the o th ers. To beat a track you need to win 3 rounds, each against a different\nopponent. It would be nice to have more than two racers per race, but\nthis isn't much of a problem as there is just so much else to distract you\nwith. There is even a track where you can perform stunts - but somehow the only trick I managed to pull off was the one where you wipe\nout. Finally, of course, you can race against a mate - although you'll\nneed a fairly large TV to enjoy this one.\nNo Fear Downhill Mountain Biking is a classic. There are simply very\nfew other games that offer the dose of adrenaline pumping action this\ndoes. Bike down to Gameswire.com now and grab a copy.\nIn association with\ngames u/ ire. com\nA WHOLE NEW WORLD\nPharaoh (PC)\nFirst off, can I please apologise to the members of my coursework group\nfor not doing any work this week. It wasn't my fault - if anyone is to\nblame it's the people who wrote Pharaoh. Never before have I been so\naddicted to a game - at one point I looked up at the clock to find six\nhours had passed without my noticing.\nPharaoh is the newest city building game from the people who wrote the\nCaesar series. As the player you play the part of the local noble, controlling the city indirectly through construction, resource management\nand politics. If you've played Caesar ///, then you'll know what to expect.\nIf not, then just imagine SimCity with five times the complexity and a million times the addiction factor.\nWhat entranced me for so long is the incredible level of detail. From the\nbasics of ensuring a constant supply of food and water for your people\nto the complexities of keeping the gods and your neighbouring\npharaohs happy, there's always something that needs your attention in\nand around the city. With the added problems of coping with the flooding of the Nile and finding the money to build gigantic monuments and\npyramids, Pharaoh is one of the most complex and involving games I 've\nplayed.\nAs games go, this is not an easy one. Once you complete the first few\ntutorial missions, things start to get more and more difficult as nearby\ncities request goods and invading forces threaten your city. I am currently\nabout five missions in after 30 hours playing or so, and the feeling of joy\nwhen you finally achieve your objectives after hours of managing crisis\nafter crisis is well worth it. Creating a good city requires a lot of planning and thought, but if you get stuck there are loads of web sites\naround full of useful tips and strategies for building the perfect metropolis. The graphics, especially in high resolution mode, are excellent and give\na great sense of a living, bustling city under your control (assuming\nyou're any good, that is). The sound effects are atmospheric enough, but\nthe in-game music really got on my nerves after a while. At least you can\nswitch it off, I suppose.\nOverall, this is an excellent game. I haven't seen a game this addictive,\ninvolving and interesting for ages. The sense of actually controlling the\nlives of thousands of citizens is very strong - a good game for the meg lo maniacs amongst you. If you've got important coursework to do, you\nmight want to wait until the holidays, but otherwise I'd advise any gamer\nto buy this now.\nViv Ben\n\n"

WV-:\n.:\nx^y^ xC X \u00a7||||\n\u2022UX::' frequency SJ\\\nBeck\nMidnite Vultures\n(Geffen)\nGood old reliable Beck. Providing music for people who like to have everything in the\nmix, be it hiphop, country, rock, Albanian tr ad folk, whatever. He' s spat out singles and albums as diverse and entertaining as anything you could shake a very big stick at, and his live shows have been fantastic riots of goodtime decks' n' pop action. He' s been the\nfrazzled pop genius who's managed to add another adjective to the language \"Beck-esque\" which has been handy when describing anything that's been genre bending and innovative. And when opener( and single) Sexx Laws kicks in, it feels like the same Beck we all know and love. Bouncy beats, immense choruses, and a load of noises you wouldn't expect, including a banjo. So he's back. But this time something' s different. Beck's found something else to aim his musical pistol at. This once self confessed Loser now thinks he's Prince, and he's after your young daughters. And your sexy girlfriends. And probably even your nice old mothers. Beck is on a sex trip. He' s ditched the slacker person a for the moment, and traded it in\nfor a casanova eyeing up the lay deez style. This is Beck's skewed vision of how the funk should be done, and he's not half bad. Peaches and Cream hashim wailing away in an ecstatic falsetto over some grinding guitar and body slamming beats. The wall of sound created by the piano and Hendrix guitar in Milk and Honey retain both that classic r'n' b sound and Beck's insane inventiveness. Filthy horns( ahem) par p their way through Debra\nwhilst Beck ooh s and a hhs breath i ly. That said, there's still plenty of that old Beck magic: the aforementioned Sexx Laws was the obvious choice for the single, and you could spend days finding all of the weird and wonderful flourishes on here.\nBut - and this is a big but( ahem) - this time round it sounds as if Beck is joking. When Prince (for example) does this sort of thing, it sounds like he really wants to get into the\nlistener's pants, whereas our man here is simply flexing some more musical muscle. The situation is not helped by his lyrics. It's never been a problem before, but here the wil fully obscure references and rhymes don't suit the music and just sound silly. A sample:' Her left eye is lazy, She is so Israeli, Nicotine and gravy'. Or how about 'Tweak my nipple, Shamans go cripple, My sales go triple'? Very odd. Of course, it's all about shagging, but at times it sounds more comedic than genuinely sensual, and that's clearly not the point of ' the funk'. But - and this is an even bigger but ( ahem again) that doesn't mean this album is in\nany way bad. There's more invention and tip-top tunes here than anything released in\nmost decades. Maybe he should just stop trying to sound like something else and stick\nto being himself. That way we're more likely to have an even longer-term relationship with the Beckster.\nPan Am - The Sound of the 70s Yoshinori Sunahara\n(City Slang)\nWhen I got this CD to review I thought it would be a compilation of 70's disco or funk or such like. It turns\nout to be nothing of the sort. Although some of the\ntracks do have a seventies feel to the m,I don't think\nthat any of the tracks are actually from that golden era of glam, disco and punk. The tracks are mainly instrumental, with only the\noccasional vocal sample thrown in. The music is\nchilled. Chilled to a nice cool level of cold that the\nlikes of Massive Attack can only dream of. To give\nyou an idea of how chilled it is, when I played this to\nmy house mates last Wednesday afternoon, they\nwere all asleep after 2 0 minutes. True story. Now, this\ncould be a good or bad thing, depending on what you want from your music, but I don't know anyone who doesn't want to switch off once in a while and just, well, chill.\nAt times, the music does get a little cheesy. The tracks are loosely based around a plane trip, hence the Pan-Am reference in the title. The album opens with Take Off and ends with Landing. The tracks inbetween don't have such direct references, but you get the idea that it's trying to recreate the feelings\nyou get on along flight. The opening is more upbeat, with a little anticipation creeping into the\nelectronic beats. This moves on to sleep in the middle. At the end, it's moved into a kind of tired but\nhappy mood, as the collection draws to a close. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn'ta track\ncalled Overly made-up trolley dolly serves meagre\nportion of dried-up meat and stale roll, but you can't have everything.\nOverall, the album is great to have on in the background, or to relax to when you are doing something else, but there isn't really enough substance to give it\nthe longevity it needs. I can see myself getting bored of it quite soon, although it is nice while it lasts.\nKunal Tom\n\n"

He learnt\nthat the University's prospectus has been forced to\nditch nude photos of students taken whilst they\nwere working for the supermarket company Asda.\nKevin understands that advertising the fact that\npossession of a Cambridge degree has enabled\ngraduates to get as far as Asda is not the best way\nof attracting ambitious students. However, this was\nnot the reason the photographs had to be\nremoved; University authorities feared they might\noffend potential applicants. When contacted, Asda\nclaimed intriguingly that the pictures \"showed life\non a graduate training scheme as it really is.\"\nCOLOURFUL COURIERS\nKevin has been listening in on Xerox representatives who were on campus last week discussing the\nDocUcentre The plan that was being considered\nwill enable customers to send documents from any\ncomputer on the College network to be professionally printed at the Xerox facility. Runners wearing bright red sweatshirts sporting the Xerox logo\nwill then race your document straight to you while\nyou stay seated at your terminal. It is hard to see\nhow such a labour intensive scheme could be\nmade profitable, until that is you consider the vast\namount of cheap student labour which is available\nin South Ken. Kevin understands that a logo and\nname for the new service has not yet been\nfinalised. As usual, any suggestions made to\nkevin@ic.ac.uk will be passed on.\nARCHER LINKS\nKevin was recently searching The Telegraph's website and came across an interesting feature on\nLord Archer's wife. Lady Mary Archer is a top sci-ent is t, whose scientific brilliance won her a double\nfirst at Oxford. She is now one of Britain's top solar\nenergy experts. The Telegraph claimed she was\ncurrently a visiting professor at the Department of\nBiochemistry here at Imperial College. Kevin\ndecided to verify that her links with the College\nMish\nMash\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nwere for real. She keeps a very low profile within\ncollege, not even getting a entry in the IC phone-book. Kevin has also not seen her at any official IC\nevents. Kevin's investigations resulted in an explanation from a source close to Suite Five: \"She\ntends not to be invited to College functions, in case\nshe brings him with her.\"\nY2K DISASTER\nOver the millennium an exclusion zone is to be\nthrown around the campus. Kevin learns that the\nonly people who will be allowed access to the\ncampus will be the teams who are ensuring that\nthe various bits of kit around campus that could\npotentially vapour is e( or otherwise endanger most\nof the population of London) are kept under con-tro l. Kevin would not be surprised to see backup\ngenerators and other essential materials being\nstockpiled, in preparation for a \"worst case sce-na rio.\" There is some reassurance in the fact that\nalthough steps are being taken to avert cat astro phe, the College has, in a worrying ly uncharacteristic bout of foresight, recently revised their \"Disas-ter Recovery Plan.\"\nERICSSON - INSPIRATION\nKevin would like to reassure the campus community that Ericsson have not been taking a keen\ninterest in the mechanics of the proposed Xerox\nscheme. However, it is just plausible that an army\nof 'runners' would prove more cost effective than\nEricsson's current proposal - telephones - to provide communication to IC.\nTo comment or contribute:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\nor email kevin@ic.ac.uk\nComputer Shop\nLevel 4\nMechanical Engineering Building\nExt. 46953\n9.30am5.00 pm ccs-shop@ic.ac.uk\nPrices @ http://www.cc.ic.QC.uk/od min/ shop/\nI, BLANK CD OFFER\n25 CD's in a PLASTIC CASE\nP only \u20ac25.00\n\n"

It explores\nmemory and time - giving you a shocking\nsense of perspective about just how small\nwe all are in such a vast, old world. I have\nmade it sound heavy, but it isn't the whole\nplay is fluid and powerful; at times visually\nstunning, at others hilarious.\nI arrived to find a leaf and a blind fold\nattached to my chair. I looked around and\nsaw everybody else was similarly endowed.\nBefore I knew it the play had begun. I was\nimmersed in an extraordinarily eye opening\nworld. It is difficult to detail many examples\nbecause to do so would be to spoil the sur-p rise, but to cite one: A prehistoric man has\nbeen discovered in the ice and is the focus\nof much scientific debate; tattoos are discovered on his front. Parallels are continuously being drawn between this mystery Ice\nMan and the main character. We hear on\nthe TV about the said scares as the main\ncharacter talks to his girlfriend on the\nphone; a ghostly hand appears upon his\nchest and begins to scar his body - the effect\nis incredible. It is obviously achieved\nthrough some sort of projector, but nobody\nis thinking that at the time. The silence in the\ntheatre is complete and the hair on the back\nof my neck rose. The play is packed with\nsimilarly astonishing effects. It is the most\npowerful piece of devised theatre I have\never seen.\nNirvana - A retrospective\nBen\nProud Galleries \u00a33 Cone.\nNearest Tube Charring Cross\nHello, hello, hello, hello - yes my friends let me\ntake you back to your grunge days with NirvanaA retrospective. This is the biggest British collection of Nirvana photographs, providing a wide\nand detailed insight into the essential 90's band,\nwith back stage photos and those taken in and\naround London. The three guys who put this\ntogether - Martine Goodacre, Steve Gullick and\nStephen Sweet - were all music photographers\nworking for NME and all had good access to the\nbands early popularity here.\nProud galleries is just two minutes walk from\nCharring Cross Tube and is the perfect place to\nvisit to experience some hard hitting and easy\nlooking photographic art for the first time. It is a flashy little venue and worth a look - even if you\nhate the band, the imagery is impressive.\nKurt probably would have hated it - but he hated\neverything to do with fame and money - \"if you're\nrich, you're a dick\". Certainly everything to do\nwith the opening party was everything Nirvana\nwasn't: suave, flash and pretentious. Nirvana\nwere raw and honest, they just plugged in and\npoured out their emotion through the amps. The\npictures, however, do the band justice in this\nregard. Seeing the live pictures with the sounds of\nLithium rampaging through my head made me\nwant to return to those days of wearing \"grunge\nis dead\" t shirts and getting pissed for the first\ntime.\nObviously, the eventual suicide of the man himself will be in the back of your mind as you wander between these flashes of the Nirvana era. It\nwas not, however, something that the exhibition\ndwelt on - instead being \"A tribute to the life of\nNirvana, not to the death of Kurt Cobain\" say\nGullick, Goodacre and Sweet. Of course, it is\nimpossible to blank it from your mind completely\nwhen looking into Kurt's eyes in some of the more\nsombre photographs, with the haunting rasps of\nPenny Royalty Unplugged filling the air.\nThe gallery aimed not at a definitive history of the\nband, but rather a more British and personal\nslant. I feel the range achieved in these pictures\nwas impressive - it wasn't all pictures of Kurt looking fucked up or endless blurry live shots of the\nband smashing up their equipment again. No,\nthe pictures were a perfect balance. Go on,\nentertain yourselves.\nID Ben\n\n"

The\n5th team spirit is fast becoming leg-end ary, however, and we didn't let it\nphase us, with an equal ising goal\ncoming almost immediately from\nthe boot of Dino, back on the goal\ntrail after 2 weeks off. With QMW'spacey forwards always threatening,\nthe rest of the half was fairly even -a great save from stand-in keeper\nAndy Pease keeping the score level,\nbefore we took the lead with a3 rd\ngoal of the season from Gazza.\nIn the 2nd half we again started\npoorly, letting them score from a corner with a tap in from inside the\n6 yard box. As the half wore on,\nthough, we began to click into gear\nwith great work at left back from\nTiger and on the right from Vince. A cross from the left from Dino then\nfell to Spaceman, whose persistence\nin aru ck of players saw the ball into\nthe net from close in to regain the\nlead at 3-2. There was no looking\nback from there, with Andy in goal\nhaving a great game, and even Dij\nand God coming very close to sc or ing. Dino took the chance of notching up a second hattrick of the sea-son, with the third goal a brilliant\ncurling left foot shot from the edge\nof the area. A late debut appearance by Steve from the 7th s was\nanother bonus from the day, and IC\nV's march on.\nFootball - sevenths\nIC VII 1\nKings VI 4\nOur last meeting with the side\ncurrently leading the 6th division\nended in a very heavy defeat, so\nwe were all really up for this\ngame. Due to some freak train\ndelays, we actually got to their\nground half an hour before they\ndid!\nKings started extremely\naggressively, and we found ourselves pushed back to our own\nhalf. However, despite the\nnotable absences of Caprano\nand Andy Smith, our defence\nheld solid. Despite all their pos-session, Kings only created a handful of opportunities in the\nfirst 40 minutes. However, they\nfinally broke through when a cracking shot took an unfortunate\ndeflection off the Guvnor (playing\nin an unfamiliar left-back role)\nand flew past Andy Pease in goal.\nWe kept our heads up though,\nand managed to equalise when\nMark finished superbly off a great\nfree kick by Leacho.\nWe started the 2nd half with\nour heads up, but they scored\nshortly after the re-start from a good header. We then lost Barney to injury, and from then on it\nwas always going to be difficult.\nWe continued fighting for every\nball, and we were dangerous on\nseveral occasions as the wingers\nmanaged some good counter-attacks. Longy managed to kick\nthe bar at one point off a great\ncross by Keri! However, as the\nhalf wore on we started to tire,\nand they scored two more goals\nagainst our now makeshift\ndefence.\nHowever, it was a brave and\nspirited performance by all of the\nIC VII squad, and this result\nshould bode well for the remainder of the season.\nIN BRIEF\nCrosscountry Boat Club Netball Hockey\nWe boarded the tube at South\nKensington, and 21 stops later we\nreached beautiful Cockfostershome of Middlesex University.\nMiss Whiplash continued to\ndominate the all comers, picking\nup her own gold medal, ably\nbacked up by Louise in 13th. The\nwoman's team came third overall,\ndespite not having a third runner.\nImperial provided 10 of the\nfirst 12 men and won the team\nchampionships, with the 'B' team\nin second place, easily beating\nUCL, King's and Holloway firsts.\nStan-ron was first home, winning a second gold individual\nmedal to add to his collection. XXX\nGaffer was next in to collect silver,\nwith the Veteran arriving 4th. Frank\nand Stereo-Dan finished joint 5th, holding hands like the daisies they\nare, with Daisy Boy right behind\ncompleting the team.\nWe left Trent Park confirmed\nonce again as the undisputed\nchampions of London. Until next\ntime boys...\nThe weekend before last saw the\nImperial College and Queens\nTower Boat clubs romp home to\nglory yet again ahead of Oxford\nand even the GB Elite squad,\nLeander.\nThe Fours Head has teams\nfrom almost all clubs in the\ncountry taking part, with the start\nnumber for each crew taken from\nlast year's finishing position. The\nICQT mens cox ed four won senior two, as did the QT men's quad and the women's cox ed four, the women's cox less four\nwon the elite level open (the top\nlevel of entry for this regatta).\nTo put all this in context,\ntogether ICQT won 4 pennants\ncompared to Oxford, Leander\nand Oxford Brokes who each got\ntwo and dozens of other BUSA\nand club crews who at best got\none each.\nWell rowed IC.\nCross Country win ULU!!\n-<\nICSM 18\nIC 40\nFor the first time the sun shined on\nIC Netball team as we ventured\ndown to Teddington. After ogling\nthe rugby players the match finally started. Everything went well,\nwith shots flying in from all angles\nfrom our super shooters Sarah\nand Shirley. The first quarter\nended with us 8-3 up, a lead we\nwould not lose. During the (extra\nlong) second quarter our players\nwere flying all over the place. In\nthe centre court Jane, Jess and\nDorothy intercepted nearly every\npass. At half time we were streaking ahead 17-8. Thanks to our\nextra stretchy defence, Kirsty and\nKathryn, ICSM scored only 10\nmore goa!s. Substitute shooter\nRebekah arrived at half time to\ndart around the circle scoring\ngoals at a rate of knots, and the\nscore was 40 by the end of the\nmatch. Congratulations - still\nunbeaten in the Union.\nImperial IV 1\nGKT III 1\nThe fourth team's eternal quest to\nfield a full side remained unfulfilled,\ndespite Feminine Geordie leading\nby example and squeezing his large\nposterior into a keepers kit.\nThe match began promisingly\nas the 10 warriors present scored\nan early goal (that's been 2 goals\ncoming) from the penalty spot, due\nto the GKT keeper being intent on\nputting \"I'm too good for DBs\" on\nhis arse. The second half was not so\nimpressive - IC milled about in\nusual fourths style and conceded a weak goal. Then the fourths nearly\nscored again, but old habits die\nhard and the match finished 1-1.\nFollowing his recent yellow streak\nand extreme deviant behaviour,\nGrease & Groom umpired the\ngame admirably and managed to\navoid getting involved in aru ck. Well done that man! Bring on the\nULU cup so we can groove on with\nthe Diiisco Boys!\n\n"

She was also picked to be\nthe vice-captain of the BUSA\nladies team for the coming year.\nNot to be outdone, our two top\nmale bowlers - Graham Johnston\nand Robert Crosbie - also produced fantastic games.

    "content": "6 December 1999 -Felix Arts 29\nmethod A Dirk A thumping good detective-ghost-horror-who dunn it time travel-romantic-musical-comedy epic JCMG Eyre\nDirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is the creation of Douglas Adams author of Hitch\nHikers Guide To The Galaxy. Dirk is the play of\nthe book, he is a detective with a twist, belie ving in the fundamental interconnected ness of all things. He finds them between a dead cat, pizza\nand Samuel Taylor Coleridge( poet) - he also saves the world as we know it.\nYup the humour's zany Adams at his best - and the task for Dram soc is huge. The play origin a ted in Oxford, being first performed at Stowe School in 1 9 9 2 then progressing, with advice from Douglas Adams and National Lottery\nmoney, to a1997 run at the Oxford playhouse. This is the first independent production in the world! Dirk has many a challenge for the technical crew and actors a like. Andrew Prowse - a first year Materials student - has taken on the tittle role. He is joined by Dram soc members old and new( and extremely old Ed) in this fanta stic theatrical ch alien ge.T he cast is under the direction of Philip Lun n. He has much and varied experience in the theatre\nand says his main aim is to\" entertain people\". Philip shares the same birthday with Adams( there is probably some fundamental reason for this). He is confident of a successful and polished performance, labelling the play as \" brilliantly written\" and\" extremely funny\". It has taken him and Dram soc seven months from conception to performance. When moving from novel to stage there is always the risk of sacrificing parts of the story to make it suitable for performance. Although changes are present in\nthe form of small omissions and additions those\nwho enjoyed the book can be confident of seeing a new le as e of life in the characters they\nknow; the spirit always remains the same. To end with a quote from the writer of the new script: \"Lots happens, people die and there's very little sitting around and talking and with a bit of! uck everybody gets to the pub well before last orders. You can't say that about Beckett\" Well done Dram soc, break a collective leg! The Show runs from Wednesday to Saturday this\nweek in the Union Concert Hall( Beit Quad, second floor) @ 7 . 3 0 pm each night.\nTickets are available on the door at \u00a34 concessions, \u00a3 5 otherwise. Ben\nNew Ambassador \u00a3 5 - 1 0 Cone. Nearest Tube -Leicester Square\nI have not read the book, but I have seen\nthe film; this is much better than the film. It\nis an original slant on the story with slick\nand extremely versatile actors. They play a huge range of characters - including the\nhorse and do g!I'm serious I have never\nseen a better stage dog in my life, quite\ntouching really. The play was very well\nreceived from the packed out crowd and easily held my attention throughout. Jane Eyre is basically about as repressed a person as it is possible to be. She had an unhappy childhood, and ever since she can not get in touch with her sexual side - she\nalmost has a fit when Rochester kisses her neck. The play uses an interesting theatrical\ndevice, which involves the mad wife of\nRochester (the guy Jane is in repressed love\nwith) called Bertha doubling as Jane' s\" other self\" who is locked away in the\nattic/Jane's mind. When Bertha bangs on the door Jane flinches as if repressing her darker side. As Rochester talks of love to\nJane she keeps busy repressing herself\nwhilst her alter ego is upstairs busy mast ur bating. A little obvious but none the less\neffective.\nThe play is a psychological drama, effectively and powerfully acted, maybe not of\nthe puritanical lit. cr its. But I'm inspired to read the book and that can't be a bad thing.\nID\nBringing The House Down\nNur With the least impressive acceptance speech of all time, Steve McQueen wins the\nTurner prize. On display at the Tate and well\nworth the visit.\n\n"

    "content": "24 Films Felix \u2022 6 December 1999\nWhat's Out On Video\nCruel Intentions (Out to Rent 1 3/1 2/99)\nThis is the movie that had every hot-blooded male racing to the cinema\nthis summer. Based on the novel Dangerous Liaisons, Cruel Intentions\ntakes the bold step of transplanting a period drama into contemporary\nsociety. Set in the Upper East Side of Manhattan it stars Sarah Michelle\nGellar as Katherine. She wagers her stepbrother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe)\nthat he can't seduce the publicly proclaimed virgin Annette (Reese Witherspoon). If he wins, he gets to finally bed Katherine, but if he looses she\ngets his convertible sports car. Shot for a modest $10 million, the movie\nalways looks top notch, with some excellent sets that suggest the story's period roots. Staying close to the original plot (and supported by an excellent soundtrack) the movie progresses at a good pace. First time director\nRoger Kumble gets superb performances out of the three stars, particularly Phillippe. The result is a fresh, extremely enjoyable, movie with many\nmemorable scenes. Great! (3/5)\nDave\nNotting Hill (Out Now)\nWilliam Thacker (Hugh Grant), the owner of a travel bookshop in (sur-p rise, surprise) Notting Hill is broken out of his monotony by the arrival of\nfamous film star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). Their first encounter is fleeting\nand the chances of them ever meeting again seem minimal until they,\nquite literally, bump into each other. Sparks fly and soon they are falling\nin love just like any ordinary couple. Except, of course, Anna Scott isn't ordinary. Neither Grant nor Roberts are on new ground here, but they\nwork extremely well together. Grant plays his usual foppish character while\nRoberts is dazzling. Arguably the supporting cast, had they more screen\ntime, could have stolen the show - Rhys Ifans revels in his part as the\nunwashed, uncouth Welsh flat mate, and Gina Mckee and Tim Mclnnemy\nalso produce memorable performances. This is both a good romance and\na good comedy. Guaranteed to make you hang off the edge of your seat\none moment and laugh the next. (5/5)\nKatherine\nHuman Traffic (Out Now)\nWe follow Jip (John Simm), as he joins his mates in a local night-club. Jip's main aim is to have a wild night and forget all about his dead-end job.\nHuman Traffic resists the urge to present the much-publicised worst side of\nclubbing (beer, drugs and vomit) and focuses on the positive up-beat party\natmosphere along with romance and comedy. Filled with likeable characters and music from Pete Tong. (3/5)\nKatherine\nThe World Is Not Enough Competition\nThis week the friendly people from the Odeon not only have five pairs of tickets for the action packed The World Is Not Enough, but they also want to give\naway loads of promotional CDs for PCs. These fab CDs contain Bond screen-savers, behind the scene in ten/ i ews and sneaky bits from the film.

Just hand over the Felix title at the box\noffice and in return you will get a CD.

So go on, get a Bond\nCD.\nYou can also win a pair of tickets for the new Bond film by answering this not\nso simple question:\nThe character played by Desmond Llewelyn in the Bond films\nis nicknamed 'Q', but what is the characters real name?\nE mai! your answers to film.felix@ic.ac.uk before 1 2pm on Wednesday to be\nin with a chance of getting free tickets.\nThe answer to last week's question is :\nSacha Baron-Cohen (Ali G) went to university at\nCambridge and he studied history.\nBradley Basket! is the lucky winner of an Ali G,inn it video.

We\nfuel this feeling by erecting a new\nbuilding for them (including a room complete with fu(ball and\n\"The Crystal Maze\" arcade\ngame), we give them the newest\ncomputer facilities in college, we\nsupport all this with a small workforce of persons in their undergraduate office. Rather than the\nsuperb duo in the Biology undergraduate office who run the entire\ndepartment and put up with 300\nmoaning biology students, the\nmedics re gui re15 people working\nround the clock to keep the\nwheels of the medic machine\noiled and turning. But even this\nhighly organised outfit trips up\nmore than occasionally and when\nit does it seems to be at the\nexpense of everyone but them-selves. A prime example of this\nhappened just yesterday. It was an\nafternoon like any other in the\nBMS, some people hard at work,\nmost getting their daily caffeine\nhit in the cafe, and the odd few\nstudents checking their e mail.\nOh no wait they couldn't because of a stroke of genius in\ncomputer room management on\nthe part of the BMS staff. The Biology computer room (50 computers for 300 biologists, the maths\non that is never going to work)\nbooked for a first year practical, a medic lab with 26 computers\nfilled with third year biologists\n(who had booked but medic intel\nreports claimed they had no\nrecord of this), and a enormous\nroom with 85 computers\ncrammed full with 8 students having a management lecture that\ndidn't even require the use of\ncomputers. (Didn't anyone tell\nthem they had a school of their\nown ??) When asked if it would\nbe possible for a few people to\nwork quietly in the corner, the fol-li c ly challenged lecturer grumbled\na resounding \"no.\" I appreciate\nthat the medics posses well-endowed computer facilities, (Just\nwhy they seem to need 1 7inch monitors when the biologists only\nget 15 inches is beyond me,\nalthough it could be due to their\nblindness caused by a popular\nsolo past-time....by that I mean\nstudying in dim light of course.)\nbut why do people from the management school feel the need to\noccupy a room filled with computers when there are countless small\nrooms hidden away for that sort of\nthing. Another point to make is\nthe \"Lecture in progress, do not\nenter\" signs that get plastered\nalmost as frequently as \"Vote\nTasha Newton for President.\" They\nare up so often that people now\nmisread them to say \"Computer\nroom free, anyone welcome\" and\njust waltz right in no matter what\nthe situation. Admittedly the biologists have come up with a timetable outside the door (we are\nstill waiting for the medics to\ncatch on to that one) but a simple\n\"OCCUPIED/VACANT\" slide on\nthe door would suffice. A meagre\n\u00a315 in the \u00a365 million budget\nwould have alleviated so much\ngrief from daily student life but\nthese powers that be don't seem\nto get that concept in anything\nthey do.\nYours sincerely,\nAnon\nHOW LOW CAN WE GO? Dear Felix,\nAdrian Spankie deserves\napplause for raising the issue of\nthe very poor pay levels in student\nunions (Letters, Felix 1159). I would, of course, support any\nattempt to increase pay to a decent level. However I would\navoid labelling iCU as \"hypo crit i cal\". At least we supported the\ndemo - would it be better if we\ndidn't support the demo and also\npaid lousy wages? Of course not.\nWhy not write a paper on our low\npay levels for discussion at union\ncouncil? You'd get my support.\nGeorge Constantinides\nICU Equal Opportunities OffiERRANT EDITING\nEditor,\nWe would like an official\napology for the \"Outdoor Club\"\nbranding that the Canoe Club\nreceived in the last edition of Felix\n(29 November. Issue 1159). Not\nonly does this put us under the\nsame canopy of Outdoor Cooks\nand La La's, but it suddenly\ninvokes the outrageous idea that\nthe Outdoor Club might be able\nto paddle down one of *our*\nrivers. I would suggest they might\nbe pushed to ramble along one of\nthe banks.\nTo then link many cult paddling names to their society, has\ndone almost ir re pr able damage.\nAnd when one considers the\nmembership boost and consequential budget ry raise they may\nhave enjoyed, perhaps damages\nshould be sought.\nOf course, we don't really\nmind, and no offence meant to\nthe outdoor club who run numerous pleasurable weekends to\nenjoy the outdoors in a relaxing\nenvironment. We simply don't want to confuse punters into turning up for a paddle, to find themselves cooking, or worse still to\nsign up for a chill-out weekend,\nand find that suddenly they are\nflying down a raging river face\ndown.\nSo, don't let it happen again,\neh?\nThanks,\nNigel Thacker\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.\n\n"

    "content": "30 Books Felix \u2022 6 December 1999\nbooks =\nCalifornia Fire and Life, Don Winslow White, Rosie Thomas\nThis book does not set out to be classic English literature; it sets out to be\na modern detective story/thriller. It is centred on Jack Wade (wonderfully\nmacho name), a claims investigator specialising in arson for the California Fire and Life Insurance Company. The story is that he has to uncover\na murder and attempt to stop the murderer pressing for the life insurance.\nOh and the Russian Mafia, Vietnamese gangs, the CIA and other stereotyped law enforcement agencies all have bit parts too. Cool.\nWhat struck me first about this book was the tone of voice. It is just so\nlaid back, chilled out, Southern-California style that I found myself drawling the lines out loud. I loved the style; it was good-humour ed whilst also\nbeing cynical. The 'voice' continues in that style throughout the novel,\nreinforcing the thought that this is one persons individual experience; that\nthis is a real life situation because there is a real person behind that distinctive voice.\nWhat particularly made me laugh was the way most chapters ended with\na punchy little line or catchphrase in that laid back voice - 'So shake that'\nor 'Give him a headache for a change' spring to mind.\nFollowing an extremely diverse group of climbers, as they are about to\nembark on a gruelling expedition to conquer Everest, White is the latest novel from Rosie Thomas. Dr Finch Buchanan, a young Canadian,\nis restless and seeking something more in her life. She is employed as\nthe expedition doctor and is responsible for the health of the other\nmembers of the group. Al Hood, a vastly experienced Welsh mountaineer, will lead the party and has made a promise to his teenage\ndaughter that he will leave climbing once he has conquered this last\n(highest) peak. Sam McGrath joins the group on impulse at the last\nminute, following a chance encounter at an airport. He is haunted by\nhis childhood but is forced to reconsider both his past and his future\nas the expedition progresses.\nSet against the beautiful yet often threatening backdrop of Mount\nEverest, the complicated, triangular relationship between Finch and\nthe two men plays itself out with, ultimately, tragic consequences.\nThomas' descriptions and attention to technical detail transport the\nreader to the mountainside, bringing the group's experiences to life -even for a non-climber such as myself.\nHowever, the best part of the novel is when Jack is describing his education at 'fire school1 and his investigation into the murder. There is a definite feeling that the author is sharing personal experience with the read-er. Coincidentally, the author spent 1 0 years as a consultant on litigation\ninvolving fraud cases, especially arson.\nUnfortunately, a decent plot and some really superb factual information\nare all this novel has to offer. And even the plot turns down a dod gy alley\nat the end. The character is ation is limited to the 'I came from a dysfunctional family' clich e and 'jet black hair and Liz Taylor eyes and big boobs\nand a little butt1 descriptions. So, whilst there are some good investigative\ntechniques hidden in there, they are really badly utilised by a group of\npulp characters.\nIt isn'ta book that I would personally buy but it is worth borrowing from\na friend if only for the factual bits and the amusing accent.\n\u2022 Fire\nAlthough I am not normally a big fan of romantic fiction, I have to\nconfess that the complex characters and unusual setting of this book\nhad me hooked. My only criticism would probably be regarding the\nending. After the pace of the rest of the novel, I was left disappointed\nby the conclusion. However, don't let this put you off - it's a brilliant\nbook.\nHelen\nFree Stuff\nActually reading the books section?

The two nodes are continuously mirrored, and linked by\nfibre optic cable. The connectors\nto this cable failed, causing both\ncomputers to go down simultaneously. The issue of a system failure if\nthe cable failed had been raised\nwhen the system was installed,\nbut the link was not backed up,\ndue to the cost of installing a parallel fibre optic cable. This is the\nfirst time since the system was\ninstalled that it has failed, but further failures may convince College to install a second cable.\nThe system was offline for\nmost of Wednesday and Thursday, but was recovered at around\n5.00pm Thursday evening, in\ntime to print pay cheques on\nThursday night, allowing the\ncheques to be distributed as normal on Friday. The BACS\n(Bankers' Automatic Credit System) direct credit payments to\nemployees' bank accounts were\ndelayed, however, with payment\nbeing credited on Monday 29\nNovember instead of the previous\nFriday.\nAmong those affected were\naround 250 students who work\npart-time for the Union or for\nCollege as bar staff, demonstrators and others who are paid on a weekly basis. Other affected staff\nwere cleaners and a few technicians, according to Malcolm\nAldridge, Controller of Financial\nServices for the South Kensington\ncampus.\nMr Aldridge said that the incident was \"a tragedy\" but commended the finance office staff,\nwho had worked late on Thursday\n25 November to ensure that staff\nwere paid as soon as was p ossi ble.\nGuilds Union on trial over abandoned bathtub\nJIM G EACH City and Guilds Union, in the form\nof their president, is facing disciplinary action over events following the\nField Cup.

The\ngrandson of a former wealthy landlord, Da is born into a family continually persecuted by their small village at the insistence of local Communist Party officials. Chen spends most of his childhood trying to overcome his politically incorrect background and deal with the poverty and\nadversity facing his family.\nCo/ours is not very literary in its style or approach, consisting more of\na statement of a series of events them a gripping narrative. Basic emotional reactions never really come into play for the reader, resulting in\nan intellectual realisation that some of the events should be heart\nwarming, funny or even infuriating - but nothing more.\nChen does at times employ some seemingly poetic imagery to describe\nthe landscape of his childhood, but without much effect. The members\nof Chen's family, who have been through such adversity and triumphed,\nare not treated any better. The story of what they went through is very\npowerful and yet the passages that deal with his family are not. Perhaps\nit is difficult to see where more character is ation is needed when one is\nwriting about ones family, but we do not share Da's familiarity with his\nsubject.\nThat is the shame of it all - Chen has really achieved a great deal in his\nlife and overcome a huge amount of adversity, but even as we follow\nalong with him towards his ultimate success, there is no real emotional involvement with the reader.\nI would have preferred to read about one man's view of this tumultuous\nand chaotic time in the history of China, but instead the book offers\nonly one man's view of himself.

So, until next\nweek I 'll leave you with some\nfine reviews to read and some\nserious form-filling to do...\nBeastie Boys\nThe Sound of Science\n(Grand Royal)\nWay back in 1 981 a group of friends from upstate New York, linked by a common interest in the burgeoning local hardcore punk scene, formed their own band just like loads of kids did at that time. Almost two decades later, Adam Yauch,\nMike Diamond and Adam Horovitz (who joined two years later) or MCA, Mike D and Ad Rock as they are better known\nto the world - the Beastie Boys - are global superstars. They've sold millions of records all around the world, got their own\nrecord label, magazine and clothing company (hell MCA's even become a Buddhist) whilst the band staged two of the\nbiggest charity concerts of all time in a bid to free Tibet from oppressive regimes. Along the way they've courted Eminem\nstyle controversy, provoking tabloid outrages and accusations of hypocrisy - oh yeah, and they've also consistently managed to make some really exciting and genuinely innovative music. This is what The Sound Of Science is here to celebrate, collecting 42 of their best tracks on two CDs - over two hours of music in all. While some \"best of\" albums seem\nquite lazy - simply containing a band's twelve top forty hits in chronological order - this is a truly comprehensive career\nretrospective, from their earliest recordings up to the latest gems from He//o Nasty, taking in previously unreleased tracks,\nremixes, rare b sides and even a CD-ROM video track of the Beasties in their element, along the way.\nWe begin back where it all started, with some of their first sub 90 second recordings as a garage band captivated by\nseminal hardcore outfits like Black Flag and Bad Brains. Egg Raid On Mojo and an eponymous track culled from this\nera sound far from accomplished, miles removed from their more well known hip hop infused sound, but there is something in the raw energy of the Beasties rocking out furiously that still succeeds in engaging the listener. It was Licensed\nto III though, one of the biggest selling debuts ever, that really saw them getting noticed. Licensed., marked a distinct\nchange in their sound from hardcore wannabes to three Run DMC loving white boys trading rhymes over old school\nbeats. Given that the average perception of white rappers is akin to the much ridiculed Vanilla Ice, it seems strange that\nthey've enjoying such a long and successful career - critically as well as commercially. However, unlike the qui ff meister, they've never pretended to be something they're not, instead harnessing their rhymes to big, dumb 70s rock riffs and\nrapping about what they know - at this stage basically sex and drink. Nowhere is this moment better captured than on\nthe classic anthem Fight For Your Right.\nDespite the overwhelming success they enjoyed, the Beasties became disillusioned with both their public image and the\n'meat head' following they had acquired through their allegedly tongue in cheek anthems of drink and girls. Like any\ndecent band, they decided to continue twisting the formula. Paul's Boutique and Check Your Head saw them reintroduce live instruments to the mix. An eclectic variety of influences (for which they are now renowned) and a slightly more\nserious lyrical content began to show and is represented well on this compilation. From the frantic hardcore blast of\nTime For Livin' to more laid back stuff like Something's Got To Give and funky shit like Shake Your Rump, all the way\nthrough to straight up hip hop like So Watcha Want, this compilation really does highlight the genuine breadth and\nsheer quality of their now extensive back catalogue.\nOf course, you'll find all their more recent hits on here and as ever it's a pleasure to hear the fantastic likes of Sabotage, Sure Shot, Intergalatic and a Fat Boy Slim remix of Body Movin'. If you've only ever heard a few of their songs, this\nalbum is probably the best place to start. If you're already a big fan, you might grumble about a few omissions like No\nSleep Till Brooklyn and Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun, but basically you get a load of your favourites plus quite a few you might not have, all on one tasty double album. Either way, there really aren't many bands quite like the Beastie Boys, and you'd be a fool to miss out on this. Excellent.\n\u2022 Max\n\n"

    "content": "6 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Clubs & Societies 37\nLinux Users Group RCS University Challenge\nLinux has been in the news a lot\nrecently, but, just as with other buzz\nwords, few ordinary people know\nwhat it is. In its most basic def in i tion, Linux is a collection of programs that control and run a com-put er, usually a PC. This collection\nof programs is referred to as an\n\"operating system\". From the point\nof view of the computer user, Linux\nis what allows him/her to communicate with the computer. The operating system determines how a computer runs tasks, the kind of\nsoftware that can be loaded, and\nwhat kind of \"interface\" it can\nhave. Examples of other operating\nsystems are Unix, MacOs, and the\nubiquitous Windows.\nIf you ask the same question to\nthe great majority of Linux users the\nanswer you will probably get is:\nLinux is cool. To explain this suspiciously smug answer let's ask more\nquestions.\nWhy Linux?\nLinux was invented because its\ninventor, Linus Torvalds, did not like\nwhat was on offer to run his PC. He\noffered his brainchild free of\ncharge to the world, with the condition that it should be kept freely\navailable and open to anyone who\nwanted to add to it. Hence, from\nthe start Linux was destined to be\nborn and raised by creative programmers who not only wanted\nquality but also took pride in their\ncontributions. Imagine, that the\nLinux factory is the whole world,\nand its personnel are some of the\nbest programmers anywhere - and\nall are working for free!\nThe end result is an operating\nsystem that is open, free, easily\navailable (on any archive site), supported by a huge number of users\nand developers, dependable, stable and very powerful. Oh, and\nfree.\nSomething is fishy here, I hear\nyou mumble. Nothing can be that\ngood? Well... there are a few\ndrawbacks. Until recently, it has\nbeen said that to own Linux meant\nhaving to be a hacker. Nowadays\nthis is not entirely true, because\nthere are many companies and free\ndistributors that are producing\nLinux packages that are easy to\ninstall and easier to manage than\nprevious versions. In the recent Las\nVegas Comdex show Corel's version of Linux was claimed to be\n\"easier to install than Windows\".\nMore and more vendors are\nrealising the potential of the free\noperating system market and are\nwriting software for Linux as fast as\nthey can. Some well know names\nare Matlab, Mathematica, IDL, Star\nOffice (now owned by Sun), Corel,\nand even Silicon Graphics. The\nquestion should be rephrased to:\nWhy not Linux?\nWho is using Linux?\nLinux is moving slowly from the\nexclusive realm of Computer Science departments to other university departments, and ultimately to\nthe real world (well, almost). There\nare a few companies that have\nbecome converts after bad experiences with un re ii able systems and it\nis, together with Unix, one of the\nbest systems for Web servers. Here\nat Imperial, the Linux user community is growing and active, as exemplified by the activities of the Linux\nUsers Group and its ic-linux-group\nmailing list. There are several\ndepartments that run computers\nwith NT/Linux partitions and\nbecause of its advantages for scientific use it is gaining followers in\nresearch areas.\nCandid comments from a few\nAeronautics students (both undergraduate and postgraduate): \"quite\neasy to install\", \"OK, screen fonts\nneed some work but I am quite\nimpressed with it\", \"I am not very\nexperienced but I have found Linux\nto be very reliable and considerably quicker than NT.it 'feels'\nmore stable\", \"Very reliable and\nfun desktop\", \"lovely operating s ys tem, I like going to the Internet and\nfind anything I like\", \"A lot of the\nfree software is brilliant\".\nHow do I learn more?\nCome to the next Linux Symposium\norganised by the Linux Users\nGroup or, alternatively, visit\nhttp://linux.cc.ic.ac.uk/ to subscribe to our mailing list. Hope to\nhear from you soon!\nThe time has now come for the\nRoyal College of Science Union to\nlaunch the 2000-2001 University\nChallenge Campaign. Imperial\nStudents have won this prestigious\nnational competition in the past,\nand earlier this year the medical\nschool opened up the possibility\nof Constituent College Union\nentry, by getting a team of medical students to represent the College on the world renowned television show. Although their\nprogress exceeded that of the\n'official' IC team, who never\nmade it to the televised rounds,\nthe medics performance left a lot\nto be desired. The RCSU has now\ntaken up the baton, with its sights\nfirmly set on this year's trophy.\nAmongst the thousands of our\nstudents, we must be able to find\nfour who can combine to become\na team better than anyone else's in the country. We definitely have\nthe students to win this competition - we just need to find them.\nWe could follow the example of\nThe Imperial Winds is a sub group\nof the Symphony Orchestra and is\nnow in its third year. Under the\nbaton of our conductor, Colonel\nDuncan Beat, the band has grown\nto a regular 45 players covering a range of abilities.\nA wind band is made up of a brass section (trumpets, trom-bones, french horns and tuba), a woodwind section (flutes, clar-in ets, bassoons, saxophones and\noboe) and percussion.

This year's programme\nincludes Hoist's Second Suite in F, The Blue and The Grey (a selection of American Civil War pieces)\nand Trumpets Wild along with\nsome festive tunes.\nWe always welcome new play-our predecessors and send four\nrandom volunteers, and hope for\nthe best possible outcome.

Part of the student common room would also dis-appear, as would several ICSM\nUnion rooms (as computing facilities move into the basement).\nThe driving force behind the\nredevelopment would seem to be\nthe undoubted need for total refurbishment of the Charing Cross site.\nHowever, although all parties would\nlike to see a thorough appraisal of\nthe building leading to'a redevelopment programme, the potential for\na quick injection of cash from the\nintroduction of the Primary and\nSocial units into the building would\nseem to have swayed the discussion\ndramatically. Prof Whitehouse\nexplained that the special trustees\nwould release \u00a32.5 million if the\nunits can be accommodated.\nThe big question, however,\nremains whether or not students will\nbe involved in the decision making\nprocess - or whether the crucial\ndecisions have already been made.\nProf Whitehouse himself refused to\nbe drawn on the issue, simply stating that \"it's a very important project and I 'll work very hard to ensure\nthat it happens\".\nSUNIL RAO\nThe ICU International Tamil Society annual show was held on Friday 26 November, in the Great\nHall, carrying on in the proud tradition of past shows and events.\nThis year's event \"Sangamam\n'99\" was billed as a millennium\nshow, aiming to showcase the talents of the members of the society\nand their friends by \"drawing from\nboth Eastern and Western cul-ture s\". The show finally kicked off\nwith the traditional lighting of the\nlamp and was prefaced by a classical (Carnatic) music solo. Following a brief welcome speech by\nSutharsan Vivekananthan, Tamil\nSoc President, the show began in\nearnest with a well-received classical solo dance performance. Most\nof the dances featured in the show\nwere un surprisingly set to music\nfrom contemporary Tamil movies.\nThen came the first of the two\n\"fashion show\" sections, with a variety of clothing on display, from\ntraditional saris to modern\nstreet wear, all modelled to thumping hip hop sounds. Nearly thirty\ndifferent students modelled, showcasing dress wear from a number\nof fashion houses across London.\nThe best bits - those that got\nthe crowd really going - came\nafter the interval, though. A hilarious comedy sketch targeting \"The\nJerry Springer Show\", but with\nTamil participants instead of the\nusual trailer-park trash, elicited a great reaction from the crowd,\nand the closing folk dance\nremained (as ever) incredibly pop-u lar, providing a grand finale to\nan evening that by and large ran\nvery smoothly.\nThis year's show was attended\nby almost 350 people, not as\nmany as last year but still a good\nturnout, with the memories of the\ndrunken brawl outside last year\"s event still fresh in the minds of the\norganisers.\nThe show was, like most of its\nkind, a charity event, with proceeds going to the Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO), a charity set up to aid Tamils displaced from Sri Lanka owing to\nthe violence there.\non London\nScotland.\nIn addition to various speeches\nmade by politicians and representatives from the major education\nunions, NUS National President\nAndrew Pakes also addressed students and union members. Mr\nPakes said, \"The largest student\nprotest in a decade proves the\nissue of tuition fees will not die. The\nmarch has brought a national\nfocus to fees, hardship and pay for\nstudents, and we must now put\npressure on MPs locally. This action\nwill be followed in the Spring at a lobby of parliament by NUS and\nstudents' unions. It's time that\nGovernment and business put their\nhands deep in their pockets and\npaid up for a decent and equitable\neducation system.\"\nUCAS figures indicate that\nfees, since their introduction, have\nled to a drop in applications - particularly from mature students\nwhere there has been a drop of 1 0\nper cent over the last two years.\nAngry NUS fees protesters descend\nJIM G EACH London's streets were awash with\ntwelve to fifteen thousand angry\nstudents on Thursday 25th November, all taking part in the NUS\ndemonstration against tuition fees\nand student hardship. Students\nfrom all over the country attended\nthe march, which was set to be \"the\nbiggest show of student protest in a decade\", organised after a ballot\nfrom union members in July.\nICU President Tasha Newton,\ndespite her initial hostility to the\nidea at October's ICU Council,\nthought the demo to be a good\nidea, even though the Union is not\npart of the NUS, as it tackled problems that affect all students in higher education.

    "content": "6 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Games 27\nIn association with\ngames u/ ire. com\nA WHOLE NEW WORLD\nread (6)\nArmoured Fist 3 (PC) Age of Wonders (PC)\nI don't know about you, but I haven't played with tanks for many, many\nyears so it was a breath of fresh air to\ntake control of a whole group of them\nin this new game from NovaLogic.\nI had a preconceived idea that tank\nsimulations were slow and difficult to\nget into, requiring you to read\nthrough the entire manual and even\nthen being forced to refer back to it\nevery 30 seconds to seek out some\nobscure key combination. However,\nafter installing Armoured Fist 3, I found the control mechanism very\nintuitive and within five minutes I was\nblasting enemy tanks and riding over\nsand dunes like a gulf-war veteran.\nThe game centres on the M1A2\nAbrams tank and (unfortunately) this\nis the only one that you get to ride in\n- however you do get to take control\nin three very different roles and per-spec t ives, as the gunner, the tank\ncommander and the driver. My\nfavourite was the tank commander\nwhen he is sitting atop the tank wielding a.50 calibre machine gun - even\nif there is nothing to shoot at it's still a great vantage point to watch the hills\nroll by.\nThe game's only drawback is the\ngraphics. Five years ago they would\nhave been fine, but today's gamers\nexpect better.\nSo in summary, NovaLogic's Armoured\nFist 3 is quite a decent attempt at a playable tank battlefield simulation,\nwhich is unfortunately flawed by the\ncompany's reluctance to embrace the\ntechnological revolution that 3D graphics cards have brought about.\nAge of Wonders is the latest strategy/fantasy game to hit the shelves.\nOn the surface it looks like a lot of different similar games - Heroes\nof Might and Magic III, Warlords... But this is its strength not a weakness - it manages to superbly pull off an excellent strategy turn-based\ngame.\nYou control a hero who roams around the countryside, rallying\ntroops under his banner to ultimately vanquish the opponents. There\nare 8 different races to choose from and over 100 different units,\nand you have to capture cities in order to get revenue to get troops\nto get an army to conquer more cities. You move around the screen\nin exactly the same way as in Heroes (point mouse and click) but\nunlike Heroes your army consists of only a few units, which makes\nthe battles much more strategic. There are several new features,\nsuch as when you pass an enemy unit he can strike you but you cannot retaliate. Also, with ranged attacks you have to consider line-of-sight and the arc of the shot (a catapult is more likely to hit someone behind a city wall than an arrow). If you don't like doing tactical\ncombat, or you know you'll whoop the enemy quick, you can opt to\nhave the combat in \"quick\" (ie Warlords) style. The combat system is\nvery good because it is tactical and easy to use. Another interesting\noption is that when you capture a hostile city you can get your own\nrace to immigrate to it and boot out the existing inhabitants.\nThe levels are huge with usually one or two subterranean areas too,\nwhich makes for very long games. In my view this is a plus because\nit adds to the strategy side of the game, but it can be extremely\nannoying when your enemy sneaks behind your army and captures\nyour city deep within the kingdom. You have to leave behind a border guard to prevent this happening.\nThe sound is adequate and the graphics are brilliant, although the\ncharacters look a bit cartoonish. The gameplay on the whole is\nexcellent. Picking up the control system is as easy as pie. The multiplayer option (absolutely essential nowadays) is very good. It allows\nyou to take turns simultaneously instead of waiting for your opponent\nto move, chess-like.\nAge of Wonders is a great strategy game with real depth to it (almost\nlike a proper RPG). While it may not be a breakthrough in gaming,\nit has enough new bits and an excellent interface that should serve\nto satisfy any strategy fan, with hours of gameplay available. The\nonly gripe I have is that it can be slightly long and that there is now\nan additional candidate for best strategy game of the year.\nBugs Bunny (PC)\nAt last Bugs Bunny makes it onto the\nsmall screen with this new game from\nInfogrames entitled Bugs Bunny - Lost In\nTime. The intro picks up Bugs on route\nto the beach for his holidays, but unfortunately he gets lost and ends up in an\ninventor's shed. With the famous last\nwords of \"that's a funny looking carrot\njuice dispenser\" Bugs is flung into the\nmists of time and so begins an epic\nadventure to return him home.\nIn the game itself you take charge of\nBugs from a Tomb Raider perspective (ie\nbehind him) and must guide him though\na series of challenging puzzles. Like Ms\nCroft, Bugs has a wide range of the normal moves available to him including\nkicks, dives and rolls. In addition, how-ever, Bugs also has his ears! These are a welcome feature that act as directional\nindicators guiding you onwards towards\nthe next stage of the level. This drastically reduces what was for me the worst\nfeature of the Tomb Raider games - that\nof being in a huge level and not having\na clue which direction to go in.\nThe graphics are spot-on - they really\ngive you a sense of being in the cartoons\nthat we all used to (and indeed still do)\nwatch. During the course of the game\nyou will be reunited with ail of Bugs's favourite enemies, including Yosemite\nSam, Witch Hazel and (my favourite)\nMarvin the Martian. These characters,\nlike Bugs, are all well animated and\ncrisply executed.\nOverall this is a fun game that, despite\nthe title, is not just for children. It will\npresent a good challenge to the average\ngamer and will also give a great deal of\nenjoyment along the way.\nAndy in Mark ID Andy\n\n"

    "content": "8 Feature Felix \u2022 6 December 1999\nDavid Potter: Is The Whole\nWorld in his Palm?\nWhilst no-one was looking,\nIC graduate David Potter\nbuilt up a global computing\nand communications empire.\nSo, how did he do that?\nDavid Potter should be a household name. If\nnot a household name, then at least his name\nshould be recognised by every member of\nImperial College. There are few computer\nmoguls who head world beating companies\nthat spark less instant recognition. Those in the\nknow recognise his achievements, as is shown\nby the fact that he sits on several government\ntechnology committees. Bill Gates also has a few things to say about him. In fact, in a memo\ncited in the recent Microsoft antitrust case Bill\nGates singled out not Oracle, not Sun\nMicrosystems, not AOL, but Psion as one of the\ngreatest threats to Microsoft's global business.\nIf I were to tell you that David Potter founded\nand is the Chairman of Psion Group, then the\nbells of recognition would ring. Depending on\nyour vintage you would probably think first of\nthe Psion Personal Organiser, the world's first\nhandheld computer, or the massive selling\nPsion 3 series.\nYou might be surprised to learn that he did\nhis PhD at Imperial and even lectured here for a time, his particular area of interest being nonlinear mathematical physics. What is really\nintriguing is thus the way in which he made the\ntransition from academic to mogul - after all, his\ncompany is competing against some of the\nbiggest high tech companies in the world and\nwinning. So it was a privilege to have the opportunity to interview him and hear his story to find\nout why he thinks he has achieved what he has.\nBackground\nDavid Potter did his PhD at Imperial from\n1 967-1 970. His research interest was in mathematical physics, especially dealing in plasma\nphysics and all aspects of non-linear problems.\nIn the course of his work he began using computer simulations of complex physical phe-nomen a, in which he developed a reputation.\nHe was on the staff here at Imperial, and you\ncan even find his book on Computational\nPhysics in the library. Aspects of this area of\nphysics later lead onto Chaos Theory.\nThe Two Strands\nEven during his teenage years there were two\nparticular strands of thought that interested\nhim. Firstly, science and the way things work\n(following a family tradition - his grandfather\nwas an academic). His other area of interest\nwas in business.\nA Smarter Investor\nHe became involved in stock market investment and research into smaller companies\nafter the huge stock market crash of 1 974. He\nthought that the valuations were 'ludicrous'\nand bought into the market with his savings.\nHe was very lucky and he did very well. It was\nthis that allowed him to set up the capital base\nof what is now the Psion Group. It did something else for him as well: It taught him a lot\nabout business and the way companies should\nbe run. At around this time Intel released their\n8008 and 8080 microprocessors. Because of\nthe success of his business interests, he decided that he didn't want to spend all his life as an\nacademic.\n\"When the microchip came along in the middle seventies, I thought that this was going to\nhave a huge impact on the world, and I wanted to participate in that.\"\nDoctor of Strategy\nIn 1980 with a very small base (initially just\nhimself and about \u00a31 00 000 of capital that he\nhad made himself) he set up as Psion. This is a big step for anyone to make - he had no previous management experience, no staff, and\nno income, just himself and his bright idea. He\nhad to start generating revenue and fast. How\ndid he do it? He targeted software publishing\non the microcomputer market, for computers\nlike the ZX-80, the Acorn Atom, and the Apple\nII. You have to remember that at this time it\nwas a tiny cottage industry. He began to make\nmoney out of that, and in the first year he registered a turnover of \u00a3120 000 and profits of\n\u00a312 000.\nIt was not very much, but during the course\nof that year he could see that the market was\ngoing to expand a lot, so he then began to\nbring in development people - some of whom\nwere from IC. One of them was Charles\nDavies, who was a research assistant at Imperial, and subsequently he became the lead\narchitect in a number of key software products\nand operating system components. However,\nPotter and his ex-IC staff didn't take any Intellectual Product Rights (IPR) from IC. All they\ntook were their skills and applied them to a different area. By the end of the first year, Psion\nbegan to develop software.\n\"In the history of Psion, software has always\nbeen the root of the company. We're particularly known for our palm tops and Organisers\nand so on. The real driver behind all that, all\nthrough, has been microcomputer software.\nFrankly, we are one of the best companies in\nthe world at doing that, in different areas.\"\n\n"

    "content": "6 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Films 25\nStraight Story\nDavid Lynch is, undoubtedly, one of America's greatest living directors and\nthus the release of a new movie carrying his name becomes an eagerly\nexpected event - and the chance of disappointment looms massively. This\npotential is made all the greater by the fact that this his latest offering is a sign of a major U turn in his directorial style - unlike his recent works (Lost\nHighway in particular) it's a simple linear story told in a simple, engaging,\nstyle. Free from surreal characters, flashy directorial tricks, incomprehensible plot or any complex deep-seated messages about the American psyche,\nLynch gives himself scope to tell a simple old-fashioned story.\nOf course, it's still a David Lynch movie, so the plot is hardly an everyday\none. Alvin Straight is an arthritic eighty-something living with his daughter\nin small town Iowa, where he leads a simple life mostly confined to four\nwalls and a garden. His carefree existence is broken, however, when his\nbrother suffers a stroke, forcing Alvin to set out on the 350 mile journey that\nwill eventually bring him to the lonely Wisconsin hilltop where his brother\nresides. The problem for Alvin- and f he key to the movie - is that neither\nhe nor his daughter can drive, and public transport won't take him in the\nright direction. So he comes up with an incredibly innovative solution - he\ndecides to drive 350 miles across the state on the back of a motorised\nlawn mower. Like I said, never expect a David Lynch movie to be 100%\nstraightforward...\nIt probably sounds like a slow way to travel (and it certainly is - his journey\nwill eventually take several weeks) and that in turn makes for a very slow\nmovie. Filled with beautiful panoramic shots of mid-western cornfield s, slow\npans and gentle fades, the movie deliberately mirrors the pace of Alvin and\nhis surroundings. He's a man who embodies the \"slow, careful, steps\" philosophy of his generation, and by capturing this attitude in every inch of cel-lu loi d, the audience is thrust into his head far more forcefully than any\namount of clever dialogue or intricate symbolism could do. For the same\nreason, you might be stunned to find a David Lynch movie that's been\nawarded a\"U\" certificate - Alvin's lifestyle (and, indeed, the entire world\nthat this movie inhabits) would grate so strongly with any violence, sex or\nswearing that their inclusion would simply be wrong. Indeed, what the \"U\" certificate actually proves is Lynch's class - really good directors use extreme\nviolence or strong language when they are needed and when they fit into\na story. This isn't8/ ue Velvet or Twin Peaks, and it isn't set in that kind of\nworld. Straight Story is the movie in which David Lynch has started to grow\nold. Having moved through adolescent fantasy (Dune, Eraserhead) and\nmid-life world weary gloom (8/ue Velvet, Lost Highway) he has reached a stage of life where he has found contentment. He is happy with the world\nand so, finally, his movies are too.\nscreen\nThe World Is Not Enough\nJames Bond is back to save the world (yet again) from another terrorist\nwho has got his hands on a nuclear device in The World Is Not Enough.\nIn this 1 9th official Bond flick, Pierce Brosnan plays the suave, sophisticated spy that everyone loves alongside a star studded cast including\nDame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle, John Cleese and Robbie Coltrane.\nWhile you would expect something extraordinary from a cast like this,\nthe film leaves you a little deflated. There are gadgets aplenty too, but\nthey are just an extra as opposed to an integral part of the Bond experience. The cast and gizmos do not have a chance to shine, as it seems\nthat the makers have fallen foul of giving the stunts centre stage. In fact,\nthere are so many extravagant stunts the plot is slightly lost amongst\nthem, which is a shame because there is a slight variation on the normal Bond format. Of course, you've still got bedding of the beautiful\nwomen, but the bad guy of the film is not so plainly obvious. Robert\nCarlyle has a good crack at the narcissistic head case, but he is only the\nhenchman, like Oddjob is to Goldfinger. Don't get confused by this as\nit will all became clear, and I am dying to tell you more but if I did, I'd spoil the film, as there isn'ta lot more to tell you. Fair enough, the\nstunts are amazing but they couldn't even pretend to be able to happen\nin real life. This causes the film watcher, every time a stunt happens, to\njust want to unnaturally say, \"As if!\". Maybe Bond has slipped too far\ninto the technological age, and the makers are forgetting that it is\nBond's character that makes the story as well as the magnificent stunts.\nBond has under gone a re-invention in the past with the introduction of\na female M, and now they have re-invented the Bond girls. Instead of\nbimbos who sigh 'Oh, James!', The World Is Not Enough has a nuclear\nphysicist (Denise Richards) and a rich chick (Sophie Marceau). There\nare no bikinis but lots of bare flesh but that's not surprising as Bond\nalways gets his girl(s). The film whisks you around so many locations that it is hard to remember where all the action is happening (unless you happen to have a perfect memory). Fortunately, however, whilst the plot of this film leaves\nsomething to be desired, the script is still full of those classic Bond\nmoments and corny one-liners.\nIf you like your Bond films full of action and explosions then you are\ngoing to love this movie, but on the other hand if you're looking for a fantastic Bond story you will be disappointed. Yet, despite this all this, I still have to say that this is a film that has to be seen - it is Bond after\nall.\nDave Helen\n\n"

This is fine in\ndeveloped countries, but in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica the difficulties in delivering a vaccine\nbecome formidable. For example, proteins\nneed to be kept refrigerated and have a fairly short shelf life. This may not be a problem\nin this country, but when it comes to delivering these chemicals to remote towns in Africa,\nwhich frequently lack electricity or proper\nroads, it becomes a logistical nightmare.\nAnother problem with protein vaccines lies in\ntheir manufacture. Generally these are made\nby inserting the DNA strand containing that\ngene, along with a chemical message to turn\nthe gene on (called a promoter) into either E Coli bacteria or yeast. However, both of these\nhave their disadvantages. The bacteria, whilst\nthey can string together the chemicals in the\ncorrect order to make the protein, cannot\nquite fold these up in the right way. And whilst\nyeast cells are more like human cells in their\nability to fold the protein together, they have\na tendency to add sugar molecules onto the\nprotein, also rendering it imperfect. The only\nsurefire way to guarantee the correct protein\nis to make it with parasite cells taken from\ninfected humans, but giving people products\nmade from other people's blood is a very risky\ntechnique.\nHowever, researchers are also working on a possible solution at present - instead of putting the gene into a cell, extracting the protein\nand transporting this to the at-risk patient,\nwhy not put the DNA sequence directly into\nsome of the patient's body cells, and cause\nthem to make the required protein? DNA is\nmuch more stable than proteins, in its dried\nform it requires no refrigeration, and it has a shelf life of years. The DNA can be transported to the patient and then pushed into the\ncells of the arm at high pressure using a device known as a Dermojet. The cells would\ncontinue to make this protein, priming the\nimmune system to prevent the reproduction of\nthe malaria parasite.\nWhilst this technique is certainly less fraught\nwith difficulties, it would still be necessary to\ngo out into the field and vaccinate- people,\nand it is most likely that this is what will be\nrequired. However, Professor Bob Sinden of\nA parasite cell ready to infect a human\nBiology and his colleagues are working on\nevaluating a revolutionary new idea. The\nthinking behind this is ingenious. When the\nmosquito bites a person, it injects a small\namount of saliva in order to make it easier to\nsuck up blood, and it is this mechanism which\nallows the parasite to infect a human. What if\nthe mosquito could be made to make the\nvaccine protein, and inject it as it took a meal? In effect, could the mosquito become\na flying syringe?\nProfessor Sinden has shown that fruit flies can\nbe made to spit out small amounts of this\nprotein in the laboratory, and is currently\nstudying whether repeated tiny doses such as\nthis would actually produce or suppress an\nimmune response. He stresses, \"This is just an\nidea that is being tested, and should we find\nthat it does not produce a good response, we\nshall return to the drawing board and think of\nother ways.\" And even if it is successful, there\nis no way that he or his colleagues would\neven consider introducing this technology\nuntil they were certain it was fully understood\nand safe. \"That is a long, long way down the\nroad\", he cautions.\nMalaria is a disease which affects some of the\nworld's poorest people, and Professor Sinden\nbelieves that it will only be defeated by an\nintegrated campaign using all available tools,\nincluding drugs, vaccines, bed nets or even\ngenetic engineering. There is an international\norganisation called the Multilateral Initiative\nin Malaria (MIM) seeking to do just this. The\nWorld Health Organisation has announced\nits intention to eradicate malaria in the long\nterm - but unlike smallpox, malaria is a very\ncomplex disease, for which there is no effective vaccine, and no integrated strategy for its\ndefeat. Clearly, this will require a very long\nand sustained campaign.
