    "content": "Numerous studies have confirmed\nthat one of the challenges in major investment\nbanks is the harsh working conditions. 80 hour working weeks are a norm in the banking community. One\nbanker confessed that \u201cthere are days I [he] don\u2019t get to\nstepoutside;whenIdon\u2019tgettoseelovedones\u201dandaccording to the WSO 2022 Investment Banking Work\nConditions survey, 75% of people in the industry believe long working hours negatively impact personal\nrelationships. The challenges and struggles of working\nin the City, in high-flying, high-reward careers, are ev-ident.\nAn article from The Guardian also informed the\npublic of the tragic death of Moritz Erhardt. Having\nworked for 72 hours without sleeping, Moritz sadly passed away from an epileptic seizure. It is thought\nthatthelackofsleepandinexhaustiveworkheightened\nhis risk of seizure. Questions have been raised around\nwhether the high-pressure internship culture in the\ncity\u2019s financial institutions makes it difficult for bankers to take breaks from \u2018the magic roundabout\u2019 during\nthe early years of their careers.\nThe Diocese of London has suggested that church-going in the city has risen by 25% since the financial\ncrisis, with St Mary Lothbury church, opposite the\nBank of England, having many regular attendees on\na given Wednesday lunchtime. The Bible teaches that\n\u2018everyone is equal before God\u2019, giving people identity\noutside of their profession, and value as part of God\u2019s\ncreation. This sense of love and community can be a\ngreat distinguisher from feeling like just a \u2018cog in a larger machine\u2019.\nAs a Christian investment banker, it can be difficult\nnot to be swept along by the ruthless culture and to\ninstead ensure you live according to Biblical morals.\nFor this it is essential to set aside time to focus on one\u2019s\nfaith. In a discussion with Michelle Barlow, a Christian\nworking at the hedge fund Nephila, she highlights that\n\u201cthere is nothing wrong with ambition in itself\u201d, but\nfindsthatgoingtolunchtimetalksatStHelensandnot\nsurrounding herself just with high-flyers ensures she remains grounded in her career.\nKen Costa, a former banker at UBS and Lazard, is a\nprominent Christian figure on Wall Street. In his book\nGod at Work, he admits to feeling a calling to banking,\nbut also considers his workstation to be his \u2018worship\nstation\u2019.Costadedicatestimeeverydaytoreadboththe\nFinancial Times and the Bible, believing that the God\nwho created and sustains the world is also present in\nthe workplace.\nDuring a recent finance panel held by the Imperial\nCollegeChristianUnion,featuringChristiansworking\nin the City, Theodora Lee McAlea shared her career\njourney and her own approach as a Christian. Theodora grew up in a Christian family in Singapore and\nmoved to London to complete her Masters. She started\nher career as a private equity research analyst at Goldman Sachs and enjoyed the early years of her career receiving a high standard of training and embarking on\nvarious business trips. However, she later felt the \u201cfutility of work\u201d and realized that clinging onto worldly\nthings prevents one from seeing God at work.\nThe banking environment teaches bankers to strive\nfor success and compete with others. This can be a\ntrue test for Christians working in the City, but they\nremember that they serve a King who saved his people\nin the humblest way; crucifixion. As Christians, we are\nhere to model Christ, by being loving and kind to our\nneighbours, and we are reminded to put our trust in\nGod rather than just in worldly pursuits.\nMatthew 6:24 says that: \u2018No one can serve two mas-ters. People try to serve God and money, but you can\u2019t.\u2019\nIt may seem challenging to be both a Christian and an\ninvestment banker, but the Bible teaches us that it is\npossible to navigate the financial world so long as we\nput Christ at the centre of our work. We are urged by\nTheodora to remember that we should be living for\nChrist and according to his teachings in the Bible, regardless of maintaining a busy life in the City.\nFaith and finance: examining the compatibility of\nChristianity and investment banking\nMany companies pride themselves on the wellbeing\nof employees, but an often-overlooked topic is how\ncompatible work is with religion. In one of the most\ndemanding sectors, investment banking, the tension\nbetween Christianity and job demands is rife.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n38 investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Harry Schlote\nBusiness&Investment\nBeatrice De Goede\nInvestment Society Writer\nFOLLOW OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES FOR THE LATEST EVENTS, NEWS, AND OPPORTUNITIES\nic\u2013investment ic.investmentsociety\nic.investmentsociety\n\u201cExpulsion de los mercaderes del templo\u201d by Cecco del Caravaggio, 1610.

    "content": "24 music.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Joe Riordan\nTara Palchaudhuri\nMusic\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nThose who are uninitiated in the realm\nof classical music may\nthink of it being this one\n\u2018super-genre\u2019 of epic proportions where all music\nfrom Bach to John Williams is stored. However,\nthe genre known as \u2018classical music\u2019 has many more\nnuances: the category can\nbe further subdivided\ninto time period, there\nis no one mood or tone,\nand many different performers will have different interpretations of well\nknow pieces of music.\nSuddenly classical music\nbecomes a bureaucratic\nnightmare trying to find\nthe right composer, the\nright performer, and the\nright movement.\nApple Music has recently decided to travail\nthe tangled web of classical music by releasing\na brand new shiny app,\n\u2018Apple Music Classical\u2019,\nwhere they hope novices\nand aficionados alike will\nflock to appreciate the\nworld of classical music.\nUpon opening the app,\nwe are greeted by a \u2018Listen\nNow\u2019 playlist selection.\nUnlike other music apps,\nthis panel showcases only\nclassical music releases\nand albums allowing people to stay updated with\nnew and exciting interpretations to classical mu-sic, as well as see music by\nup and coming composers\nwho have recently been\npublished. For the classical novice, one need only\nscroll down to find playlists dedicated to highlighting the \u2018essentials\u2019 of\nmany popular composers\nand also directs you towards a helpful podcast\nto introduce you to the\nworld of classical music.\nThe \u2018Listen Now\u2019 section certainly gives the attention to detail that classical music needed but\nunfortunately remains a\nlittle confusing. The layout needs tidying up and\norganising, it might be\nthat things like \u2018composer\nessentials\u2019 could easily be\nput into an entire section of their own.\nPerhaps the best\nsection is the \u2018Browse\u2019\nsection. Trying to navigate classical music,\nespecially if one is not\nan expert, is a daunting\ntask. But now Apple has\ndevisedaclearandeasyto\nuse system. The \u2018Browse\u2019\ntab one has a user-friend-ly interface showing subheadings like as \u2018Composers\u2019, \u2018Periods\u2019, \u2018Genres\u2019\netc. One need only look\nthrough these sections to\nfind any of the multitudes\nof recordings Apple pos-sesses, particularly since\nApple has allowed one to\nclick on a heading such as\n\u2018Film Music\u2019 and a search\nbar at the top allows a\nuser to filter by composer,\nfilm title, orchestra etc.\nIt\u2019s a wonderful idea and\nI think the interface is\nincredibly easy to use and\nunderstand.\nOne thing I think Apple can improve on\nis the addition\nof a heading titled\n\u2018Mood\u2019.\nA lot of\nnew classical\nmusic listeners\nwon\u2019t know any or-chestras, composers\nor even names of\ninstruments, but\nmany new listeners will embrace\nnew music based\non the mood they\nfeel at the time\nand will appreciate\nApple Music\u2019s Creatively\nNamed Classical Music OffShoot: Apple Music Classical\nOur resident Arts Editor, Gilbert Jackson, and the only\nperson with knowledge of classical music gives his honest\nreview of Apple Music Classical.\nGilbert Jackson Music Writer\n\n"

    "content": "Business student, Aussie, mother of\ntwo adorable dogs, and most im-portantly, someone who appreciates\nfine dining, Rosemary Sun launched her\nTikTok account @rllyrosemary earlier\nin 2023 to share her amusing life as a\nrestaurant connoisseur. She loves to try\nout different cuisines, posting her lunches and dinners, discussing her take-outs\nand in-dining experience, and sometimes gives us an insight into what life is\nlike for a Business student \u2013 spoiler alert,\nit is pretty sweet. Her videos, short and\nefficient, not only comment on the food\nbut also on the interior design and the\nkindness of the staff. She additionally\nvlogs her travels, her runs through Hyde\nPark, Paris or Barcelona, her childhood\nas a 1D fan and some fun party events\nthat Imperial throws. With most videos reaching above 1,000 to 2,000 views\nand some above 30,000, she keeps her\nfollowers happy, posting roughly every\nweek, sometimes twice.\nFelix: Why did you start this\nTikTok?\nRosemary: Since I\u2019ve lived in London\nfor three years \u2013 and in these three years\nI\u2019ve had some incredible experiences \u2013\nI\u2019ve never documented my experiences\nand it hit me earlier this year that I\nonly have five to six months left in\nLondon. I was like, \u201cI really need to\nstart documenting,\u201d and so that was one\nreason.\nFelix: How long did it take you to\nmake your first video versus now?\nRosemary: Ummm. My first video\nwas a 12-course classic-style restaurant\nin Mayfair, and I had a photo of each\ncourse and I typed out exactly what\nthat course was. That took me about 45\nminutes because it was Japanese. I don\u2019t\nspeak Japanese and I was fact-checking\nletter by letter how to write each word.\nIt took forever but now I don\u2019t make\nthose photo posts anymore. Now I\nmake videos with the voiceover, but I\nremember when I first did a voiceover\nvideo; that video took so long. I would\nre-record my voice about five times for\neach segment. Now it\u2019s a lot faster. I just\nsay whatever is on my mind. I want to be\nas honest as I can because I notice that\nwith a lot of food related TikTok videos,\npeople say things such as, \u201cSave this for\nyour next day out!\u201d or, \u201cYou have to\ntry this place!\u201c that are purely used for\nclickbait to get more interaction even if\nthe place is not that good. If I find a food\nplace that is not worth the heart, I just\nwon\u2019t post about it.\nFelix: You don\u2019t want to post\nnegative things, but then isn\u2019t it good\nto tell people that it\u2019s over-hyped?\nRosemary: For sure. But I also\nconsider that I could have had one bad\ninteraction and I do not want to post a\nbad review because of that. For example,\nwhen I was in Sydney, Australia I went\ntoacoupleofrestaurantsthatwerereally\nhyped, that everyone told me to go to.\nBothweremediocreandIdidn\u2019tfeelvery\ngoodafterpostingthevideosaboutthese\ntwo establishments, because I thought\nin retrospect, \u201cIt might have just been\nlike the chef\u2019s off day\u201d. For me to\nmake a whole video for two,\nthree thousand people\nto view, telling them\nnot to go, did not\nmakemefeelgood.\nGranted that my\nviewers actually listened to what I say\nbut subconsciously I thought that if the\nplace is not good, better not mention it.\nFelix: What kind of cuisines do you\nnormally post about?\nRosemary: I do enjoy fine dining,\nbut I think that\u2019s because coming from\nAustralia, we don\u2019t have much of the\nMichelin Guide-style restaurant. That\njust doesn\u2019t exist in Australia. Fine\ndining is something that was\nquite special to me and\nmy family when we\nfirst moved to\nLondon and we\nwould go quite\noften just for\nfamily time\nor something\ns i m i l a r .\nNow that my\nparents aren\u2019t\nin London\nanymore, going\nthere reminds me of\nthe times I spent with\nthem which is quite special.\nOtherwise, the highlight of my day\nis lunch. For example, during exams\nthe day would be very grim because\nmy friends and I would be studying\nthe whole day and ordering delivery\nfor lunch was a great break from the\nmoment and then I would make sure we\nwould eat something great like from The\nsacred sandwich shop. I don\u2019t think I have\na style yet. I think I\u2019m still exploring.\nFelix: You film many videos for\nlunch and dinners, but what about\nbreakfast?\nRosemary: I\u2019m very big on eating the\nsame breakfast every single day and it\u2019s\nnot changed since I\u2019ve moved into my\nflat. If you watch my daily vlogs, you\nwould notice it\u2019s the same things: eggs\nand turkey sausage.\nFelix: Do you think you\u2019re going\nto continue this project back in\nAustralia?(Rosemarywillstartherjob\nat the Bain Office in Sydney, Australia\nearly in 2024)\nRosemary: For sure. At least until I\nstart working. I have until next February\nor March until I start working and\nbetween then I just want to explore and\nlive my life. I think the show will be\ncontinuing. I may do a few travel vlogs.\nFelix: Like when you went to\nSingapore?\nRosemary: Yeah.\nFelix: Could you do this and work\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n36\nCredit: Rosemary Sun\nFOOD & TRAVEL\nRosemary: the foodie, not the herb\nCharlotte Probstel Food Editor\nMeet Rosemary Sun, a graduating Imperial Business student with a love for sharing restaurants that would make your jaw drop.\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial has an exploration board that\nprovides funding and guidance on\nplanning an expedition. Expeditions\ncan range from cycling through France,\nor sport climbing in China to big wall\nclimbing in Madagascar or kayaking in\nGeorgia. They can be as crazy and ambitious as you like or stay relatively on the\nbeaten track, just so long as the trip will\npush you out of your comfort limit in\nsome way and won\u2019t put you in unmiti-gateddanger.Inthisarticle,Iwillexplain\nmyexperienceplanninganexpeditionto\ngo alpine and rock climbing in Alaska. I\nwill also talk about the expedition itself.\nPart 1: The Planning\nI had always been more of a follower.\nFriends of mine would think of some\nadventurous weekends or sometimes\nlonger excursions. I would tag along, get\na lift there, borrow their equipment, and\nlaugh at all their jokes as a thank you.\nBut as I had graduated from Imperial,\nI wanted to plan an adventure of my\nown \u2013 it was my last year of eligibility\nfor funding from the Exploration Board\n(you are eligible up to one year after you\ngraduate). So, partly inspired by the\nmovie and book Into the Wild, I set my\nsights on heading to Alaska.\nDeciding on the location and what\nyou want to do can be relatively tricky.\nIt can require a lot of creativity and\nresearch if you don\u2019t already have\nsomething in mind. The leader of the\nexpedition to Bolivia, Charlotte, wanted\nto go bouldering somewhere in Asia,\nbut the upcoming monsoon season\ncould not support her wish. Therefore,\nsomeone suggested she should look into\nSouth America. She trolled through the\nGoogle search results of \u2018bouldering in\nSouth America\u2019 until coming across an\nobscure article suggesting there was a\nvastly unexplored bouldering location\nin Bolivia. She checked it out on Google\nEarth - it looked cool - and thus an\nexpedition was born. In my case, I knew\nI wanted somewhere green and leafy\nwith big mountains. I thought about\nPatagonia and New Zealand until ruling\nthem out because they would\u2019ve been in\nthe wrong season. Alaska was the next\nchoice.\nOnce you have chosen the location\nand activity, you can go to the first\nstep (and first anxiety) of planning the\nadventure: finding a team that will join\nyou. (Solo expeditions are possible too,\nso you can skip this step if doing one.)\nFor Alaska, I put out a message on the\nImperial Mountaineering social media\npages, outlining what I wanted to do,\nand the prerequisites for anyone who\nwanted to come. Silence followed for\nwhat probably wasn\u2019t that long, but felt\nlike an eternity, until I eventually got\nsome responses! I even had to turn down\na few people in the end! It was mad. The\ninitial anxiety was over and replaced\nwith unbridled excitement.\nThen came the challenging part for\nsomeone who is usually a follower: I\nwas the one being followed! \u201cWhat do\nI do now?!?\u201d I thought. I had done so\nmuch research by this point, carried by\nthe wave of excitement of having my\nown adventure, and by the time the team\nhad its first meeting I could answer most\nquestions, and give good groundwork\ninformation as to how the expedition\nmight go. And as everyone discussed\nwhat they would like to get from the trip\nand their expectations, we began to get\nmore of a sense of how to proceed. They\nwere happy. I was happy. Big excitement.\nThere were lots of boring logistical\naspects we had to consider next, such as\nhow to apply, when to apply, what you\nneedtoapply,andexamplesofsuccessful\napplications. Luckily, it could all be\nfoundontheExplorationBoardwebsite!\nJust google Imperial Exploration Board.\nThe board members are also very helpful\nin answering questions; their contact\ndetails can (you guessed it) be found on\ntheir website.\nTo draw an analogy most Imperial\nstudentscouldgetbehind,Isawplanning\nan expedition kind of like coding.\nYou have an end goal and a method of\ngetting there, but as you start coding,\nyou are met with bug after bug after bug,\nnone of which you foresaw. It\u2019s kind of\nlike that \u2013 problem after problem after\nproblem. \u201cGrrr why hadn\u2019t I thought of\nthese things at the start?\u201d you will think\nto yourself. It\u2019s a frustrating process,\nespecially when you are balancing all the\nvarious desires of your team members.\nAlthough, then again, maybe I\u2019m just\nbad at coding.\nI won\u2019t go into the nitty gritty of\nthe problems we faced when planning\nAlaska, as they are all pretty unique to\nwhatweweretrying(equipment,finding\nroutes, approaches, BEARS).

Having released two EPs and her debut\nalbum, as well as several singles and features\nsince 2016, she has been very busy. Whilst\nher lyrics can feel clich\u00e9 and her production is\nnothing spectacular, her powerful vocals and\njazz sound are her main appeal. Hopefully, her\nstrengths aren\u2019t offered beforehand like her\nprevious album. However, I am still looking\nforward to this album, if only to hear what kind\nof direction she will head in with her vocal.\n2508\nCharlotte Cardin\n99 Nights\nThe sophomore album from\nthe brilliant Genesis Owusu\ntitled Struggler is set to come\nout in October 2023 and I\ncould not be more excited to\nhearit.His2021debutrecord\nwas one of my favourite\nreleases that year, showcasing\nlots of style, character and\npoignantly crafted lyricism\non topics like mental health\nand racism. The new teaser,\n\u2018Leaving The Light\u2019, hints at\na slightly different direction\nfrom the indie guitar beats\non \u2018Smiling With No Teeth\u2019,\nincorporating these super\ngroovy synth lines coloured\nby Owusu\u2019s intensely\ncharismatic delivery. From\nwhat he has shown us so far,\nGenesis seems to be a jack of\nall trades and I\u2019m confident\nhe will not disappoint\nwith this creative detour.\nDefinitely somebody you\nwant to be keeping an eye on.\n1808\nGenesis Owusu\nStruggler\nAlthough I do like some of his stuff,\nPostie has never really been a go to of\nmine and I\u2019ve been largely indifferent\ntowards his music. From what we know\nso far, his new project Austin, however,\nseems to be more of a personal one.\nAnd, although I wasn\u2019t blown away by\nthe new teaser, \u2018Mourning\u2019, I did think it\nhad many likeable qualities and its vibe\nstriked me as a lane Post could really thrive\nin creatively. Being the lovely and kind\ncharacter that he is, I am genuinely curious\nto see if Austin can infuse his music with\na bit more personality this time around.\n2807\nPost Malone\nAustin\nBuck Meek,\nguitarist and\nbacking vocalist\nof indie-folk-rock\nband Big Thief,\nreturns with his\nthird solo album,\nadding to his\nalready expansive\ndiscography.

With exams over and projects on its\nway out, Imperial Cinema invites you to join us for the\nbest summer film event of 2023, the Imperial Cinema\nSummer All-Nighter! So grab your cocktails, snacks\nand friends, and spend a night chilling with big screen\nspectacle. Our team has once again curated a pristine\nselection of films, from the big blockbusters to the\nfinest of British indie filmmaking, to ensure that you\nwill have the finest experience. Oh and did I mention\nour 33ft silver screen, 35mm Kinoton cinema projec-tor, and Dolby Digital EX surround sound? Yes, you\nwouldbegettingallthat,similartocinemasattheWest\nEnd. So if you missed the Spring All-Nighter in March,\nthis would be the perfect opportunity to experience\nthis fundamental Imperial experience. If you had asked\nme to describe the theme of the film line-up this time\naround, I would probably struggle, considering the diversity in scope and themes displayed in these six films.\nWith that said, a strong sense of identity and culture\nseems to be the central linkage between all these films.\nFrom the familiar gaze into the London streetscape to\nthe familial bonding with a group of alien misfits, these\nfilms showcase the societal diversity that exists in this\never-globalising world. And yet the universality of the\nhuman condition transcends all boundaries and bor-ders, and these films can speak to us even on the most\npersonal level. Solet\u2019s talk about each of them.\nAT 18:30, GUARDIANS OF THE\nGALAXY VOL. 3 (12A)\nIfAvengers:Endgamewasthefinale,Guardiansofthe\nGalaxy Vol. 3 is the epilogue. Over the course of these\nthree volumes, James Gunn transformed a relatively\nunknown band of misfits into one of the most beloved\nteams in the MCU. This volume sees the Guardians\nlooking inwards, as the past comes back to haunt one\nof their members. The team, which has always been a\nbastion of friendship, trust and hope, sets out on an\nadventure to save them as they traverse through the ev-er-so-crazy parts of the universe. Deeply affecting and\nunexpectedly funny, this film is a must-watch for both\nhardcore and casual fans of the MCU.\nAT 21:30, SUZUME (PG)\nMakoto Shinkai returns to form with Suzume, a\ntale about a disaster-affected Japan and a teenager who\nmust set out on a journey to save it using her ability\nto see supernatural forces. Gorgeously animated and\nintricately-plotted, the film continues the director\u2019s\nthreadofnostalgicfilmmaking,excellingwithscenesof\neveryday life under the backdrop of impending chaos.\nAT 00:00, RYE LANE (15)\nA promising young voice in the British independent filmmaking scene, Raine Allen Miller made one\nof the finest romantic-comedies of the year so far. Rye\nLane follows the lives of two young adults as they find\nthemselves connecting at an exhibition of \u2018mouths\u2019 \u2013\nI\u2019m not kidding \u2013 after particularly bad breakups. Very\nwitty and stylishly charming, my theatre howled into\nlaughter every few minutes when I caught it at the BFI\nearlier this year.\nAT 01:30, PEARL (15)\n\u201cNaurrr, Emma Stonee\u201d. Don\u2019t get it? Then check\nout this X-traordinary horror film in an un-X-pected\nfranchise stemming from the A24-hit X.

Undoubtedly one of the most prominent new faces\nin horror today, Mia Goth will return for MaXXXine\nlater this year.\nAT 03:40, THE THREE\nMUSKETEERS: D\u2019ARTAGNAN (15)\nFrancoisCivil,EvaGreen,VincentCassel,andVicky\nKrieps lead a star-studded cast of European actors in\nthis French epic based on the classic tale of the Three\nMusketeers. A war brews in France as D\u2019Artagnan arrives in Paris to find the attackers that left him for dead.\nIn this lavish historical production, which is becoming\nincreasingly rare in modern filmmaking, D\u2019Artagnan\nfinds himself aligning with the three musketeers of the\nKing as they navigate the violent political conflicts.\nAT 06:00, POLITE SOCIETY (12A)\nThere is no better way to end the all-nighter with a\nfun, action-packed film about a wedding heist. Polite\nSociety follows Ria as she assembles a team to save her\nsisterfromherimpendingmarriage.IncorporatingBol-lywood splendour into British wryness, the film offers\na tremendous bolt of energy to viewers, with amazing\nchoreographs and some insane martial arts sequences.\nAlso a definite recommendation from the Chair of Imperial Cinema!\nSo don\u2019t forget to buy your tickets today and come\nalong for what could be the best night of the term.

While wasps themselves are\nhighly misunderstood creatures and\nnot as aggressive as we are led to believe,\nthere is one valiant soldier among their\nranks who apparently despises them as\nmuch as we do - the hornet.\nYou never forget the first time you\nsee a European hornet (Vespa crabro).\nThese absolutely massive insects are\nstriking in every way - bright red and\nyellow missiles cruising through the air\nabove you with the timbre and tone of a\nchopper. Queen hornets can reach more\nthan 3cm in length, with a wingspan\nof almost 4cm - this might not sound\nparticularly threatening at first, but\nthat\u2019s more than half the length of your\nthumb. After hibernating all winter, the\nqueens emerge to look for a spot to build\na nest. It is during this period that they\nare most likely to be seen, randomly\nappearing in front of you and exploring\na hole in the ground or a tree hollow for\na few seconds before taking off. They\nmay also sometimes make their way into\nhouses, and at such a close range might\nappear even more intimidating.\nThe hornet is Europe\u2019s largest social\nwasp and one of the largest in the\nworld. It consumes anything from sap\nand nectar to honeybees. In fact, it is a\nparticularly good exterminator of other\npredatory insects such as wasps and\ndragonflies, even occasionally taking\non praying mantises. It is a formidable\nhunter, with powerful jaws and a lethal\nsting to boot. This, of course, is what\nwe\u2019re really scared of.\nThe metaphorical saying \u2018don\u2019t kick\na hornet\u2019s nest\u2019 came to be through\nhumanity\u2019s experimental evidence that\nthe real one isn\u2019t to be trifled with.\nMany tell, with horror, stories of being\nrepeatedly stung by these insects and\nsuffering through the pain for weeks.\nI won\u2019t sugarcoat it - these animals\ncan sting, and, unlike bees, they are\ncapable of extracting and reinserting\ntheir stinger without taking any damage.\nHowever, while the hornet\u2019s venom is\nquite potent to its prey, several reports\n(including a live stinging video on the\nwildlife education channel \u2018Jack\u2019s World\nof Wildlife\u2019) state that it isn\u2019t nearly as\npainful to us as its reputation suggests.\nMore importantly, the hornet wants\nnothing to do with us. As long as you\naren\u2019t dangerously close to a nest or\ncausingitanyseriousbodilyharm,you\u2019re\nsafe. In fact, anecdotal evidence says that\neven when disturbed, they would rather\nissue a mild warning bite than use their\nstingers.\nUnfortunately, this knowledge is\nrather recent, and these beautiful bugs\nhave been widely feared, reviled, and\npersecuted,somuchsothattheyarenow\nendangeredinsomeEuropeancountries.\nSouthern England is a stronghold for\nthem, and we are lucky to have a healthy\npopulation in London - one that has\napparently increased in the recent past.\nI have been lucky to see them twice,\nand emerged none the worse for the\nexperience!

That's how quickly and efficiently the CEC\u2019s pre-accelerator program works at Imperial.\nA newborn society, built three years\nago, CEC is flowering with ideas to\ntackle the climate crisis by empowering\nstudents to take action. Over a timeline\nof four months in early 2023, it supported inexperienced student teams with a\nsmall network to build their climate idea\nwhile forming robust connections with\nmentors and influential climate companies such as Carbon13 and Entrepreneur First (EF). With 300 members in\nthe society, 102 applications to the pro-gram, and members from the Royal College of Art (RCA), MIT, the University\nof Cambridge, and other universities in\nthe UK, it is a dynamic and diverse eco-system.Thepre-acceleratorprogram has\nnotonlybirthedincrediblestart-upsthis\nseason but has proven to become an initiative you will want to follow, support,\nor join, strengthening the CEC mission.\nMeet Lina, Elliot, and Filippo\nIn front of me was sat Lina Tlemcani,\na 2nd year Bioengineering student, current Manager and next year's Co-Chair\nof the CEC. She was a vital organ in the\nCEC\u2019s first entrepreneurship program.\nClimate-conscious Lina knew she wanted to help the climate ever since she was\na young child. She thought the only way\nto help was to become a protesting ac-tivist, but was amazed to learn that she\ncould also create change as an engineer,\nby creating sustainable products to be\nconsumed by millions of people.\nAt CEC, she felt there was a mis-sion-focus on fighting climate change\nfrom an entrepreneurial point of view.\nShe loves that the CEC is at the forefront of the climate scene.\nNext to her were Filippo Varini and\nElliot Queisser de Stockalper, this year's\nCo-Chairs. Filippo felt that in his Computing course, there was a lack of enthusiasm to join climate tech, despite\nit being a subject that brought him a\nlot of joy. Feeling that something was\nmissing at Imperial, he co-founded the\npre-accelerator program to inspire more\npeople to join this career path of environmental tech. Elliot said he was \u201cvery\nvery interested in the values and ethos of\nthe society. At Imperial, we have all the\ntools to form societies, but we lack the\necosystem.\u201d\nThe ultimate program\nJanuary 17th. The day the program\nlaunched by opening applications. From\nthat day, up until Pitch Day (31st May),\nthe CEC organised two types of events;\na bi-weekly \u2018Demo-Cafe\u2019, and work-shops. The Demo-Cafe sessions were\nvery casual meetings between teams\nand their mentors. Teams would present\ntheir work from the last two weeks and\nget feedback from mentors and their\npeers. Prizes are given for milestones\n(draft prototype, working prototype)\nand for the team which made the most\nprogress in those two weeks. Workshops included talks from Climate VC,\nCarbon13, Entrepreneur First, Imperial\nEnterprise Lab, Undaunted, Chicago\nBooth Business School, and other key\npartners. They would teach essential\nentrepreneurship skills such as \u2018how to\nbuild a strong pitch\u2019 or \u2018how to test an\nidea\u2019. Retrospectively, half of the teams\nsuccessfully continued to work on their\nstart-ups. Some teams connected further with potential investors. One team\nconnected with the CEC\u00b4s partner\nUNICEF, and is aiming to collaborate\non their product \u2013 sustainable DIY toy\nkits \u2013 for UNICEF\u00b4s schools.\nThe first cohort\n2023 was the first cohort to take\npart in the program. With a 1:1 ratio\nof undergraduates to postgraduates, the\ngroup was \u2018outstanding\u2019. One team consisted purely of first-year students, and I\napplaud them for getting involved.\nCyanoSkin\nThe winners of this year were three\nfemale postgraduate students from Imperial and the RCA. Their company\nCyanoSkin produces an algae-based\npaint - which is technically alive - and\ncan be painted onto the roofs of buildings in London (and this detail made\nmy eyes grow large) to capture carbon.\nHypothetically, if every roof in London\nwere painted, then it would \u201ccapture a\nsignificant amount of the CO2 that we\nproduce\u201d.

When the Umayyad\nEmpire was replaced by the Abbasid Empire, a group\nofUmayyadsretainedpowerinSpainbysettingupvar-ious emirates, the most notable being the Emirate of\nCordoba. The emirates were renowned across Europe\nfor their wealth, outstanding architecture, scientific\nand medical advancements, and their philosophy, and\nthis officially lasted from the 8th to the 15th century\n(however,evenaftertheSpanishandFrenchconquests,\nthe style remained fashionable).\nHaving entered Spain through vast territories of\nwhat was the Roman Empire and Berber settlements,\ntheemirateshaddevelopedanarchitecturalstylewhich\nwas founded in mathematics. Their architects had\nperfected the use of arches by developing the\nhorseshoe arch, a feature so emblematic of\nWestern Islamic architecture. Not only\nthat, but extensive use of tiling and\ntessellating patterns created mes-merising architectural buildings\nawash with colour. The emirates\nalso continued to employ traditional Romanesque features such\nas alternately coloured stonework and many domes,\nwhich were principally\nused in the design of\nmosques; since the\nmosque was a focal\npoint in many\nMoorish cities,\nthe emirates also\nd e v e l o p e d\nways of using as much space as possible by designing wide floor\nplans which have survived to this day. Buildings were\nnot the only feature to have survived; the Moors also\ndeveloped advancements in outdoor planning. They\npioneered gardens with Riad design; divided into four\nwith straight paths, and with numerous water features.\nProminent examples of Moorish architecture include\nthe Cathedral-Mosque of Cordoba, the Alhambra in\nGranada, and Mechouar Palace in Tlemcen, Algeria.\nAs a great architectural style, it also saw a revival in\nthe \u2018Neo-Moorish\u2019 style, which is prominent around\nthe world. In Delhi, the Jama Masjid, designed by Edward Blore in the 19th century, is one of the largest\nmosques in India. In the UK, many bath houses were\ndesigned in this style, as well as numerous gardens,\nsuch as the gardens of Sheringham Hall in Norfolk.\nThe Hispanic World continues to develop buildings\nwith Moorish influence, especially in the early work of\nGaudi and the Palace of Manguinhos in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe Baroque, Rococo, and Palladian\nPeriod\nThe Renaissance birthed the idea of revitalising architecture when it conjured up the \u2018Neo-Classical\u2019\nSchool, however, the Renaissance architects could not\nhave predicted the extremes to which this would be\ntaken. Baroque architecture is the \u2018marmite\u2019 of architectural styles; you either love it or you hate it. Why\npeople love it might be down to its incorporation of\nnot just elegantly decorated columns, pediments, and\nstatues but also large archways and domes from the\nRomanesque period in a match-made-in-heaven mo-ment. Why people might hate it could be down to\nit being washed in sickly-sweet frescos, paintings,\ngold-leaf, and blindingly white polished marble\nthat emulates pure decadence.\nIn fact, decadence is the primary reason for\nBaroque\u2019s existence; originally used to highlight\nthe sheer wealth accumulated by Florentine and\nVenetian bankers and merchants, which then\neventually spread to France (where it became\nthe Rococo style, which took it to even more\ndecadent extremes), Spain, Germany, and\neven as far as Russia: examples include The\nPalace of Versailles, the Winter Palace in St\nPetersburg, and Salzburg Cathedral.\nThe UK, which had just been through a\nperiod of civil war and realised that visual\nrepresentations of aristocratic decadence\nwere no longer the way to go, adopted\ntheBaroqueinamorepuritanicalsense,\nby taking inspiration from Italian architect Palladio. The Palladian style\ncontinued to use columns, pediments,\nand domes, but was characterised by\nexposed marblework rather than being\noverly decorated and using unstained\nglass or alabaster. The champion of this\nstyle was Christopher Wren who, after\nthe Great Fire of London, rebuilt the\nmajority of London\u2019s churches and civic buildings, including arguably the most majestic of all the baroque\nbuildings, St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\nThe Nouveau and Deco Period\nDuringtheageofimperialcollapse,thearchitectural\nstyle turned away from the religiously-infused Classical, Romanesque, and Gothic styles to usher in an age\nof modernity and secularism, tempered in the flames of\nliberalisation and art. The Nouveau period was short-lived compared to previous styles of architecture but\nleft its mark nonetheless. Inspired by the elegant and\npost-impressionist art movement, it sought to turn architecture into something more emotional and evocative using colour and unique stonework to define its\nbuildings. The city of Riga in Latvia is considered the\nNouveau capital of the world with colour-splashed\nbuildings and use of anatomy in its architecture.

It is Pynchon\u2019s reimagining of the world from 1893 to the 1920s, as he hops all over the map,\nreliving historical events such as the Chicago World\u2019s Fair, the collapse of the Campanile in Venice, and the Tunguska explosion, but as lived\nthrough the personalities of his comic-book characters pulled from the pulp genres of the time (westerns, cyberpunk, science fiction, and so on).\nThe book starts off charmingly enough, introducing an airship captained by a few young boys and their talking dog, with their endearing optimism and youth, before barrelling straight into a world of conspiracy and secrecy, making some none-too-subtle brushes with cosmic horror and\ndetective noir along the way. Reading this book can be a dizzying experience \u2013 it is a never-ending well of new characters, locations, descriptions,\nideas, ideologies, genres \u2013 but one that is utterly engrossing and endlessly rewarding.\nThe Paris Review Interviews Vol. I-IV by The Paris Review\nTheParisReviewisaquarterlyliterarymagazinethathasbeeninpublicationsince1953.Its\u2018TheArtof____\u2019seriesare\ninterviews with notable figures in literature, many of which have been transcribed and collated into these volumes. Each\ninterview begins with a page or so of exposition, written by the interviewer, which efficiently sketches out the slight eccentricities and personalities of each interviewee. It is remarkable how much personality and individuality is apparent in\neach interview. The questions chosen by the interviewer are never boilerplate, and the interviewees show a strong affinity\ntowards rambling, for which I\u2019m grateful. You\u2019re able to get a feeling of how much deliberation and craft each writer puts\ninto their work, and, owing to the nature of their profession, they are incredibly articulate in describing it to the reader.\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3 by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai (translation by George Szirtes)\nReading S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3 is watching a foreign, black-and-white arthouse film without sound or subtitles in a pitch-black\nroom.SetinadeterioratedHungarianvillage,itsinhabitantsslowlybecomeinfectedbyareligiousfervourandfanaticism\nat the news of a pseudo-messianic figure arriving. There is a cyclical element to this novel: time seems to be suspended, or\natleastpassatanunnervinglyslowrate,withnoparticularsenseofdirectionormomentumpresent,partlyattributableto\nits clinical, hypnotic prose. Krasznahorkai\u2019s sentences are methodical and slow, often lasting up to half a page. They aren\u2019t\nsatisfying to finish in the way, say, Proust\u2019s are, but they compliment the apocalyptic, claustrophobic, swirling narrative\nexcellently, making for a cohesive and immersive reading experience that carries a majesty quite unique unto itself.\nThe Star Diaries by Stanis\u0142aw Lem\nIn this short-story collection of interplanetary adventures, captained by the amiable Ijon Tichy, Stanis\u0142aw Lem runs\nthe range of what science fiction can offer, including trippy time-travel stories filled with clones of past selves, political\nand religious satires, and trips to galactic governments. Lem is one of the most imaginative and inventive authors in the\ngenre, and always matches his out-there ideas with a sharp wit, love of wordplay, and a tightly wound plot. This book is\na great introduction to his work, with other instalments in the series, like the psychedelic Futurological Congress, or the\nrobot mayhem of The Cyberiad, being a good follow-up. But these books hide the more thoughtful, philosophical side of\nhis bibliography, which pops up every so often in The Star Diaries, and is found more in His Master\u2019s Voice, Fiasco, or even\nhis treatise Summa Technologiae. All in all, Lem is the most complete sci-fi writer I\u2019ve read, in his ability to take advantage\nof the huge canvas that the genre offers him and wringing it for all its wonder and excitement.\nThe Hearing Trumpet by Leonara Carrington\nVery few 92 year olds have the buoyancy or life that carries Marian Leatherby through the barmy meanderings and conspiratorial journeys in\nThe Hearing Trumpet. Leonara Carrington\u2019s 224-page surrealist escapade doesn\u2019t fall prey to the common pitfalls of many of its contemporaries,\nmaintaining a coherent and fantastically enjoyable plot that still manages to capture the off-kilter disorientation that gives the genre its character.\nThe world Carrington creates is a fever dream, filled with cults, witches, magic, and mysticism. In many ways, it is a story of wish fulfilment for\nLeatherby; one that the reader vicariously lives through. She escapes the mundanity of regular elderly life into a fairy tale, one that we all wish we\ncould inhabit, at least a little bit.\n\n"

In doing so, Sole creates\na fantasy out of a serious mission, which allows him to\navoid graphic detail and technical jargon. This would\nseem like a cop out, if not for being interspersed with\n21-year-old Junior\u2019s personal mission - in the \u2018present\nday\u2019 - to find out the full truth of her mother\u2019s journey.\nThe crimes committed are laid out plainly from the\noutset, with little embellishment or symbolism.\nAs many novels do, A Crime in the Land of 7,000\nIslands dots around between locations and characters,\nbut unlike most, it does a good job at keeping the flow\nintact. A blend of mythology, magical realism, and\ncrime drama makes for an intriguing reading experi-ence, amplified by its frame narrative. Whereas this\nnarrative choice might make other books confusing\nor messy, this one manages to stay on track. There is a\nwonderful seamlessness between the different branches of the novel; a change in location always occurs just\nwhen it feels like some extra intel or a change of pace is\nneeded.\nThe beauty of Sole\u2019s tale lies in the interconnected-nessofhischaractersandthelayersofmisinterpretation\nand misremembering that surrounds their recollection\nof events. These layers are gradually peeled away for the\nreader, and each revelation is well placed in the novel,\nfeeling more like a natural gain in\nknowledge than a dramatic twist.\nAlthough shocking, none of these\npieces of knowledge seem forced or\nunrealistic. That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t\nsuspenseful; there are enough clues\nand foreshadowing to see a little\nof where the story is headed \u2013 just\nnever the full picture.\nThere is a refreshing lack of\nlong descriptions in the book;\nworld-building and character illustration is done primarily through\ndialogue and the characters\u2019 reac-tions. This allows Sole to spend\nmore time on the plot itself, and on\nits implications, without rushing\nthrough the action. While Ikigai\u2019s\nretelling of her adventure in the\nPhilippines is flowery in the use of such metaphorical\nelements as \u2018Crane\u2019 and \u2018Turtle\u2019 in place of plane and\nboat, \u2018language of the Land of the Rising Sun\u2019 meaning\nJapanese, and police forces in cars as \u2018warriors on horseback\u2019,itbynomeansdiminishesthegravitasofthematter. Instead it encourages the reader to form their own\nconnections and conclusions.\nBy the close of the novel, Sole manages to flesh out\nthe majority of the cast, exploring their individual pur-pose, past experiences, and the intricacies of their rela-tionships. It\u2019s no easy feat for an author who has decided to tackle what is arguably the most difficult topic to\nstomach, and by no means does he tiptoe around the\nheavier aspects of the case. But out of all the terrible\nthings that could have become the focal point of the\ntale, he has chosen to highlight that out of darkness can\ncome the purest forms of hope and courage, and that\u2019s\nwhere the book holds its value.\nA Crime in the Land of\n7,000 Islands\nBook Review\nZanna Buckland Co-Editor-in-Chief\nZephaniah Sole\u2019s debut novel is hard-hitting, but 7000% worth the read.\nSome other titles to get stuck\ninto over the summer:\nThe Summer Book by Tove Jansson\nBefore Your Memory Fades by\nToshikazu Kawaguchi\nThe Wind Knows My Name by\nIsabel Allende\nYellowface by R.

    "content": "Of all the visual arts, one of the most visible, strik-ing, and awe-inspiring is the field of architecture.\nArchitecture is the fusion of both the visual and the\nmathematical, and provides us with towering structures of cultural significance as well as the homes within which we dwell. Like all art, the periods and styles of\narchitecture are also dictated by the tastes of the time\nandthepurposeforwhichagivenstructureisdesigned.\nIn many countries, therefore, we see buildings and\nstructures which stand next to, but nonetheless contrast with, each other due to the many different styles\nof architecture that can be present in small vicinities.\nIt is a liberating feeling to know that we are surrounded by so much art in our lives, but even more liberating to be able to answer the questions of why these\nbuildings stand where they are, why they look the way\nthey do, and why they\u2019re all so different from each oth-er. Architecture, even at a surface level, can be the key\nto not only appreciating the art we see around us, but\nalso giving us insight into the history which surrounds\nit, and the feelings and preferences of people in previous generations.\nHerein is a comprehensive (but by no means exhaus-tive)listofarchitecturalstylesandtheirsignificance,so\nthat all of you may be able to walk past a building and\nappreciate its significance and place in history.\nThe Classical Period\nThe Classical period is one of the most well known of\nthe architectural styles. It traces its origin, needless to\nsay, back to the Classical period of antiquity which was\ndominated by the architectural styles of Greece and\nRome. This style came about as a culmination of advances in both mathematics and in marble-working,\nwhich is not surprising given the sheer abundance of\nmarble in both Greece and Rome at the time. We can\neasily spot a Classical building by its use of numerous\ncolumns in the portico (front entrance) which also features capping (flamboyant column tops) as well as the\nuse of a pediment.\nThe use of columns is so ingrained in Classic architecture that each type of column and capping is given\nits own architectural style: Ionic is the simplest form\nof column, with just a flat cap, Doric features a scrolling cap, and Corinthian features majestic floral cap-ping. While most of the original Classical buildings\nare now in a state of decay, during the Renaissance\nand the early-19th century, a revival movement called\n\u2018Neo-Classical\u2019 was incredibly popular and was used as\nthe architectural style for many state buildings across\nthe world during the age of empire: notable examples\ninclude the US Capitol Building, Admiralty Arch, and\nthe Brandenburg Gate.\nThe Romanesque Period\nTheRomanesqueperiod(knownintheUKastheNorman period) followed on from the Classical period and\ndates back to the establishment of the Roman Empire.\nThe Romanesque period spawned from further advancements in mathematics which led to the design of\nboththecurvedarchandthedome,aswellastheadop-tion of a new construction material; the brick. Where\nmarble had to be hewn from a rock-face, carved, and\ntransported at astronomically slow paces, the brick was\ncheap, easy to manufacture, and very portable; for the\nRomans and their quickly-growing empire, this was a\nhuge plus, and many domestic buildings across the empire were built in this style. It was only until the reigns\nof later emperors that civil and religious buildings were\nalso built in this style, displacing the Classical style.\nWhat makes this style unique is that flamboyant\ncolumns were dispensed with and replaced by very\nwide columns, the use of the archway was all the rage,\nself-supporting semi-circular arches were implemented\nin many entranceways, and finally, the incorporation of\nthe self-supporting dome. The result was the construction of impressively large and very sturdy buildings\nwhich have stood the test of time, and many prime examples can still be seen to this day, including The Pantheon in Rome, Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, and St Bartholomew the Great in London. So inspiring was this\nstyle that, like with Classical architecture, a \u2018Neo-Romanesque\u2019 revival was brought about in the mid-19th\ncentury with examples including The Natural History\nMuseum, our own School of Chemistry building, and\nof course, the Queen\u2019s Tower.\nThe Gothic Period\nThe Gothic period is so called because it was initially\nmocked by many proponents of the Romanesque style,\nwho thought it barbaric (hence Goth-ic), however it\nhas quite the opposite effect. Gothic architecture is\nperhaps the most recognisable style around, and was\npioneered by the architects of France, Northern Italy,\nand Germany in the mid-10th to 15th centuries. WhereasboththeClassicalandRomanesqueperiodsrequired\nlarge pillars and columns to support their large struc-tures, the Gothic style is devoid of this preferring much\nslimmer columns. This is possible due to two features\nof the Gothic period: firstly, the use of pointed arches\ninstead of semi-circular ones allows the forces acting\non the arch to dissipate more easily, and secondly, the\nliberal use of buttresses, which are external supports\nthat allow lateral forces acting on walls to act towards\nthe ground instead, allowing for buildings to be much\ntaller.\nGothic architecture was liberally used in Western\nEurope for civil, religious, and domestic buildings\nwhich now dominate the architectural landscape of\nmost Western European cities. As for all long-lived pe-riods, substyles emerged: in France, Decorative Gothic took hold and is highlighted by extravagant stone\nwork and the use of \u2018rose windows\u2019, while in the UK,\nPerpendicular Gothic was a popular choice which featured elongated columns and windows. Famous Gothic examples include Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris,\nWestminster Abbey in London, and Cologne cathe-dral. Like all \u2018good ol\u2019 reliable\u2019 periods of architecture,\nthe Gothic period underwent a revival in the mid 19th\ncentury called - you guessed it - \u2018Neo-Gothic\u2019. This\nparticular phase was prominent in the UK and the US,\nand was used in such buildings as St Pancras Station,\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n14\nEdited by: Gilbert Jackson\nSophie Pointon\nArts\nArchitecture through the ages \u2013 unveiling\nWestern European architecture\nGilbert Jackson Arts Editor\nNotre-Dame cathedral in Paris, France.\nCredit: chan lee/Unsplash\nArtseditorGilbertJacksondiscusses how the art of structure has evolved over time.\n\n"

    "content": "Album Review\nDanny Brown and JPEGMAFIA\nare perhaps the two most eclectic and creative artists in experimental\nhip-hop today, with unique sounds\nthat are otherwise absent in the genre.\nFor one, Danny is as vocally distinct\nas it comes, unapologetically sticking to his signature yelpy tone and\nunusual inflections. When it comes\nto production and lyricism, his 2016\nrecord, Atrocity Exhibition, is easily an\nall time favourite and arguably one of\nthe darkest, most soul-crushing depictions of drug abuse and self-destruc-tive spiralling. JPEGMAFIA came\ninto the scene a bit later with his 2018\nbreak out debut, Veteran, which I consider on par in terms of abrasiveness,\naggression and weirdo flair. It brings a\nbit more of a choppy and glitchy energy to the table compared to Danny,\nwith JPEG curating his own, instantly recognisable style over the years\nto come, that makes me repeatedly\nawestruck by his music. I, therefore,\ngreatly anticipated their collaborative\neffort, SCARING THE HOES, especially the utter insanity which will\nresult from Danny and Peggy coalescing over the same beats. And, in many\nways, SCARING THE HOES is an\nalbum that embraces all the weirdest\naesthetics from both artists, celebrating their often unappealing characteristics to wider audiences in a very self-aware, but nonetheless unconcerned\nfashion.\nThe title track perfectly exhibits\nthis self-awareness (\u201cStop scaring the\nhoes/Play that shit that\u2019ll have them\ntouch they toes/We don\u2019t wanna hear\nthat weird shit no more/What the\nfuck is that? Give me back my aux\nchord\u201d) and is the weirdest blend of\na head-bopping banger and a wildly\nharsh display of inaccessibility.\nJPEGMAFIA chose the worst, wettest\nclapping sample he could possibly\nfind and re-finessed it so fantastically,\nlayering these great ad libs and a\nsquealing,ear-piercingsaxophoneover\nit that, once again, you would assume\nis bound to ruin any track it is on.\nThe vocals are amazingly edited too,\nwith Peggy\u2019s verses attacking you from\ndifferent corners of the mix during\nthe refrain, creating this sensation of\nbeing encircled and ambushed into\nlistening to the track. Interestingly,\nin the process of crafting these beats,\nPeggy\u2019s decision to exclusively rely on\nthe SP-404 sampler, a more analogue\ndevice used by previous generations of\nhip-hop artists, rather than your usual\ndigital software, making the sonically\ndetailed result all the more impressive.\n\u2018Lean Beef Patty\u2019 left me and other\nfans concerned about how much\nspace there will be for Danny on the\nalbum. The song radiates the typical\nglitchiness of a JPEG track, but\ndrowns Danny\u2019s verse in the mix\nnear the end. Still, I love the\nchipmunk-esque sample,\nwhose pitch and speed\ncompletely morphs the\nvocals, almost giving\nthem a percussive\nquality - an interesting\ntechnique rarely seen in hiphop production. Although combined\nwiththeentrancinghorns,itstillleaves\nbehind an unsatisfactory aftertaste.\nThe erratic beat interruptions - that\nPeggy usually throws into the mix -normally catch me off guard\nin a great way,\nbut the one\nhere felt rather\nredundant. I\ndo, however,\nvery much\nappreciate that\nthe track opens\nwith a Twitter\nBlue diss\nstraight out the gates (\u201cFirst off, fuck\nElon Musk, eight dollars, bitch, that\u2019s\nexpensive\u201d). The track was nonetheless\na solid showing, and crazy enough to\nmaintain my excitement for the deep\ncuts.\nIn fact, the mere knowledge of the\ntrack titles was sufficient to maintain\nmy excitement, as I\u2019ve never in my\nlife read such an insane assortment\nof names. \u2018Steppa Pig\u2019 is a journey\nthat only Peggy knows how to take\nyou on, picking you up at Leicester\nSquare station and dropping you off\nat fucking Jupiter by the end of it. The\nexcessive, disorienting synthesisers are\noccasionally interrupted by these bare,\nunderstated guitar and drum sections\nthat feel like the beat stripping naked,\nproviding you with a much needed\nbreather, given how maddeningly\nchaotic the hook is. Danny\u2019s verse is\nmuch stronger compared to \u2018Lean\nBeef Patty\u2019 and broke any doubts I\nhad when it comes to how well he is\naccommodated on the project.\n\u2018Burfict!\u2019 introduces one of the\ncatchiest\nmelodies on the project and is perhaps\nthe shiniest example of Danny\u2019s and\nPeggy\u2019s mutual chemistry. The horns\non the song are triumphant as hell,\nand annihilated by the drums that\ncome in. From any other artist, such\nproduction would normally strike me\nas too much, but Peggy\u2019s employment\nof sidechaining on the entire record\nis so engaging and self-aware in its\nexcessiveness that I cannot help but\nlove it. Danny and Peggy feel like\nthey\u2019re in a vicious sword fight, with\nPeggy\u2019s ad libs giving a lot of life to\nDanny\u2019s verses. My one complaint\nwould be that the hook is fairly\nrepetitive, which may impact its replay\nvalue for me in the long run, but given\nhow remarkably well-produced it\nis, it really doesn\u2019t detract from the\nenjoyment too much.\nThe two artists then seem to part\nways to an extent on \u2018Shut Yo Bitch Ass\nUp/Muddy Waters\u2019, each performing\na track of their own, but nonetheless\nachieving impressive cohesion while\nthey\u2019re at it. The way that Danny\u2019s\nverse lazily decays into JPEG\u2019s portion\nof the track is fantastic, with Peggy\nsounding more cold-blooded than\never over a slowed-down version of\nthe same beat. The sprinting high\nhats and piano keys on JPEG\u2019s verse,\ncomplemented by minion vocal\nsamples in the background,\nmake me feel like I\u2019m\nstealing the moon in a\npiratedcopyof Despicable\nMe.\nThesameexperimentation\nwith singing samples\nwas executed much more\nmasterfully on \u2018Kingdom Hearts\nKey\u2019, where the sample is adequately\ninterrupted and layered better with\nother elements to make for an oddly\nbeautiful listening experience. The\nsong almost feels like JPEG\u2019s\nand Danny\u2019s\ntake on a\ndemented\nChristmas\ntrack, a vibe\nbrought by\nthe pretty\nbells in the\nbackground\nthat run in\nspiteofthetwogoinghardaseverover\nthem.Moreover,theonefeatureonthe\nalbum, \u2018redveil\u2019, does great at the back\nend to match their respective energies.\nThe decision to keep the verses quieter\ninthemixreallybringsemphasistothe\nimmersive instrumentation, doing so\nwithout necessarily taking away from\nis a similarly hard-hitting highlight,\nwith many similarities to \u2018Orange Juice\nJones\u2019 in terms of the selected sample,\nbut once again coming through a lot\ncleaner and more enjoyable. Both\nof these tracks are absolute treats\nfor people who fell in love with\nmoments like \u2018HAZARD DUTY\nPAY!\u2019 from Peggy\u2019s last album, being\nsomewhat of a refreshing change due\nto these juxtapositions between lovely,\nmelodic elements and harsh, abrasive\nproduction.\n\u2018Heaven on Earth (HOE)\u2019 is\nanother example of heavy and\nfantastically inelegant sidechaining\nthatgivesalotoftensionandlifetothe\ncaptivating chorus in the background.\nThe instrumentation almost seems\nlike its rushing to get to the end of the\nverse, leaving some notes behind in\nthe process, which imparts a nervous\nand hypnotic quality to the track.\nFinally, the closer, \u2018Where Ya Get Your\nCoke From?\u2019 is a brilliantly hectic\npiece with arguably the most chaotic\nsong structure, shifting between these\npace-building perc sections and huge,\ndistorted break downs that feel larger\nthan life. Initially, the restlessness\nand the lack of progression did not\nfeel too great for a closer, as the mix\nis injected with further madness in\na rather haphazard fashion rather\nthan reconfiguring the soundscape in\nan appropriate manner to wrap the\nalbum up. Still, on further listens, the\noutro started striking me as an utterly\nderanged end credits scene to a camp\nmovie from the 70s. When viewed\nin this light, the aesthetics of the cut\ncomesacrossasaveryfittingandclever\nway to close an album as cinematic in\nitsinsanityasSCARINGTHEHOES.\nWhat better way to say goodbye to the\nlistener on a project that refuses to\ncalm down or adhere to any norms in\nthe genre so stubbornly?\nAnd this is really the selling point\nof the project to me \u2013 this disorderly\ncollision between two wildly creative\nartists that are aggressively trying\nto stay away from any top 40 chart\n(although ironically, they\u2019re literally\ncharting right now!).

    "content": "music more when they can emotionally bond to a piece. Having a section\nwhich allows users to filter by mood\ncould be a welcome addition to Apple\u2019s interface.\nWhile Apple has attempted to\nsimplify the search process for classical music, for the experienced lis-tener, this is a very time consuming\nprocess. For one who knows what\nspecific piece of music they want to\nlisten to, using Apple\u2019s search bar results in one seeing around 50 results\nfor the same piece based on different\nperformers, years of release, albums and\nother subheadings. After clicking on a\nrecording, one gets directed again to the\nalbum itself and only then can one finally\nlisten to the music. It\u2019s a long drawn out process that seems unnecessary for adept listeners.\nAnother big issue which Apple has grossly neglected\nis that one cannot download any music on the app; if\nyou had dreams of listening to Mahler on the tube you\ncan forget it, Apple said \u2018no way, Jos\u00e9\u2019.\nSo the important question for many new and old\nclassical music listeners is: is it worth moving to Apple\nClassical? If you\u2019re a new classical music listener, the\nanswer is a resounding yes. While you cannot download any songs to binge listen on your way to work,\nClassical does allow you to navigate the messy network\nof classical music and appreciate and understand the\nvastnessofit.Althoughinconvenient,youcanonlyadd\nit to your library and download it when you head to\nthe actual Apple Music app. The interface with which\nApple has laid out its music is in itself an education in\nclassical music.\nIf you\u2019re an old listen the answer is a quiet no. While\nApple has done a good job in finding every recording\nfor every piece of classical music under the sun, the\ntime it takes to just listen to the recording you want is\nunnecessary. What\u2019s more, the sheer quantity presented to you actually almost dissuades you from listening\nto the music. An experienced listener already knows\nwhat they want and so doesn\u2019t need to go through the\nrigmarole of \u201cwhich composer is it? Which Orchestra\nagain? Who\u2019s the soloist?\u201d.\nHowever the decline to move to Apple Classical is\n\u2018quiet\u2019 since there are many levels of \u2018experience\u2019. A music listener who is more \u2018c\u2019est la vie\u2019 with regards to the\nintricacies of orchestral, conductor and soloist interpretation may not be impressed with the app at all. But\nthosewhoareverypedanticinregardstothesespecifics\nmay find sanctuary here. After all, having Marie Callas\u2019 rendition of \u2018Casta Diva\u2019 be the only top option is\nenough to make anyone switch over to Apple Classical\njust to hear a recording of Ren\u00e9e Fleming perform it\nmore tastefully.\nApple Classical is free for current subscribers of Apple Music.\nOn 16 April, at the age of 92, jazz\npianist, Ahmad Jamal, passed\naway. He leaves behind one of\nthe most individual and creative\nuses of the piano trio in jazz\nhistory, with a unique playing style\nthat influenced the likes of Miles\nDavis, and found itself sampled\nnumerous times since.\nJamal began playing the piano at\n3, playing professionally at 14. He\nsigned with jazz and blues record\nlabel, Okeh, in 1951, almost always\nplaying in the trio format, though\nit was only in the latter half of the\ndecade where the Ahmad Jamal\nTrio as we know it formed, with\nIsrael Crosby on bass and Vernel\nFournier on drums.\nHisperformanceinAtthePershing:\nBut Not For Me from 1958 is\nprobably the best introduction\nto the trio\u2019s sound, with the first\ntrack \u2018But Not For Me\u2019 highlighting\nmuch of its greatest features:\nJamal\u2019s block-chord playing, his\nmelodic lines and thematic solos,\nthe call-and-response interplay\nbetween all three instruments,\nparticularly with the piano and\nbass in this instance, the drum\u2019s\noff-beat accenting and assertive\ntime keeping, all kept together by\na creative arrangement of the\nGershwin tune.\nOn the surface, the trio\u2019s music\nsounds like twinkly cocktail-bar\njazz, and this isn\u2019t entirely wrong.\nMany of their hits were from live\nrecordings at jazz clubs, with the\nambientsoundsofglassesclinking\nand polite applause. Jamal is rarely\nan aggressive player, smashing\nkeys inthewayThelonious Monkor\nOscar Peterson might. However, in\nspite of his light touch and sparse\nsolos, Jamal is an incredibly\nintentional and assertive player.\nFrom the Pershing recording\nalone, listen to the voicings he\nuses on \u2018Poinciana\u2019, the dynamic\naccents that match the drums in\n\u2018Music, Music, Music\u2019, or the unison\ninventions over latin rhythms in\n\u2018Wood\u2019yn You\u2019. The more you listen\nto his music, the more you see how\nwell he understands the tunes he\nplays and how precise his note\nchoice is.\nJamal\u2019s incredible understanding\nof song structure shines most in\nhis arrangements. 1959\u2019s Jamal\nat the Penthouse puts the trio\nnext to a 15-piece orchestra. The\ndecisions he makes for when the\ntrio should cut out for the strings,\nor when the orchestra pauses for\na drum break or piano glissando\nare all so perfect; no solo goes on\nfor too long, giving each track a\ntightness and cohesion that isn\u2019t\ntoo common in jazz. In the original\ntrio setting, his arrangements\nare less visible, and often almost\nfeel spontaneous, especially with\nhow effortlessly Jamal transitions\nfrom the head to soloing. This is\nat least partially attributable to his\nmelodic and thematic approach\nto soloing \u2013 listen to Like \u2018Someone\nin Love\u2019 from his At the Blackhawk\nrecording\u2013onethatisdistinctfrom,\nsay, Coltrane\u2019s sheets of sound.\nThough Jamal\u2019s work can be said\ntobehomogeneousorevenboring\nby some, his combination of touch,\nprecision and understanding make\nhis arrangements a joy to listen to.\nWhile many call The Awakening his\nbest, albeit for good reason, his run\nof live records in the late 1950s to\nearly 1960s remain unparalleled to\nmany an ear.\n25\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nFRIDAY 16TH JUNE 2023\nMUSIC\n\n"

    "content": "The anthropogenic degradation\nof the environment is often\ndiscussedintermsofclimatechange,and\nbiodiversity loss. But there is another\ntype of damage happening beneath our\nfeet and over the horizon - that of the\nsoils and waters. Agricultural pesticides\nand fertilisers, industrial and domestic\nchemicals, and heavy metals from urban\ninfrastructures all damage soils.\nSubsequently, they can spread\nto water sources by runoff and\nultimately enter the food chain.\nThus, these contaminants\nhave environmental, health-related, and societal impacts.\nFor example, lead poisoning\nhas been shown to influence\nthe brain development of\nchildren and infants - making\nthem more prone to aggression\nand impulsion - and is linked\nto increased criminality\nrates. Additionally, a new\nclass of contaminants - UVfilters - interferes with the\nreproduction of corals and\nsome of the fish which inhabit\nthem. The achievement of\nmany of the United Nations\u2019\nsustainable development goals,\nsuch as protecting life on land\nand under water, preventing\nland degradation, global access to clean\nwater and sanitation, and building\nsustainable cities will depend on our\nability to protect our soils and waters.\nPhytoremediation: using plants to\ndecontaminate soils and waters\nFor a long time, we could only\nimproperly decontaminate this\npollution, and often at the expense of\nproducing more toxic waste. However,\nDr Claude Grison, a French biochemist,\nmay well have found a solution to this.\nOriginally specialising in antibiotic\nbacterial resistance, the course of her\ncareer changed when four university\nstudents asked her whether plants could\nbe used to decontaminate soils. Faced\nwith the general lack of knowledge\nabout this issue, Dr Grison decided to\nmodify her research axis to answer this\nquestion.\nAlthough some plants can thrive\nin polluted environments and absorb\ncontaminants, the major obstacle to\nusing them as part of decontamination\nefforts is the danger of subsequent\ningestion by insects or grazers, thus\nspreading the hazardous compounds\nup the food chain. But Dr Grison saw\nthese heavy metal-dense plants not as a\nliability, but as an opportunity. Indeed,\nshe rendered it possible to extract metals\nand other substances from such plants.\nThese compounds can then be used as\ncatalysts to accelerate the synthesis of\nmolecules of interest in pharmaceutical\nand cosmetic industries, thus creating\neconomic impetus for this method.\nImportantly, these procedures do not\nin turn generate toxic waste. They are\nbeing put to the long-term test in New\nCaledonia, where nickel mining has left\nthe soil damaged and sterile. So far, five\nspecies, chosen for their growth abilities\non heavy metal-rich soils and their\ncloseness to the island\u2019s natural flora, are\ngrowing on the experimental site and\nbeing used to recover toxic waste and\nturn it into molecules of interest.\nAfter tackling soil contamination,\nDr Grison confronted water pollution.\nAgain, the astonishing properties of\nplants provide an opportunity for\ndecontamination. The powdered roots\nof certain species, spent coffee, and\ngreen tea grounds can be transformed\ninto filters capable of absorbing\ncontaminants in fresh and salt water.\nMoreover, these filters are efficient: two\nhours are sufficient to capture a variety\nof harmful chemicals, such as UV-filters,\ninsecticides, and herbicides.\nAnother field experiment on the\nprimrose willow can be presented as a\ncase study: an invasive species in the\nRh\u00f4ne river in southern\nFrance whose intricate root\nsystem allows it to naturally\nabsorb contaminants.\nHowever, its proliferation\nthreatens native ecosystems.\nWhen removed from the\nrivers and canals, its roots\ncan be dried, ground, and\nturned into filters - without\nchemical transformation -which are then able to purify\nwater of zinc, arsenic, and\niron. Once the filter is used,\nthe metals it has captured are\nused as catalysts for medical\nor cosmetic compounds.\nThus, this phytoremediation\nmethod contributes to\ninvasivespeciesmanagement,\ncreates no toxic waste, and is\neconomically profitable.\nThe potential for Dr\nGrison\u2019s research to create\na greener economy led to the founding\nof two companies, Bioinspir and\nLaboratoires de Bioprotection, which\nspecialise in the sustainable production\nof pharmaceutical and cosmetic\ncompounds through phytoremediation.\nHer out-of-the-box reasoning and\nthe ground-breaking applications of\nher research also earned her the 2022\nEuropean Inventor Award.\nOf plants, pollution, and profit:\nhow plants can be used to\ndecontaminate soils and waters\nLorraine Deberon Environment Writer\nDr Claude Grison\u2019s innovative research into greener soil and water decontamination is explored in this article by Lorraine.\nenvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nENVIRONMENT\n10\nCredit: Envato Elements\n\n"

Elliot found it helpful to differentiate more between the\nfive different tracks, while Lina believed\nit would be useful for the cohort to be\nmore connected with the mentors in\na casual manner. Many teams were shy,\nand hence reluctant to reach out to mentors without a perfect and formal pres-entation.\nWhat is the future of the CEC?\nNext year Lina will be the co-chair\nwith Naman Sharma.

    "content": "FRIDAY 16TH JUNE 2023\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 7\nScience&Technology\nEdited by: Taylor Pomfret\nAngie Lo\nCancer is a disease of intrinsic origin,\ncharacterised by the uncontrolled\nreplication of cells. This is driven by aberrant genetic mutations, which differ\nfrom patient to patient. This huge variability makes cancer extremely difficult to\ncure as each patient\u2019s cancer has unique\ntraits of resistance to different types of\ntherapies. An effective response would\nbe to tailor treatments to the cancer cells\nof each individual patient, also known\nas personalised medicine. This significantly increases treatment effectiveness,\nbut unavoidably also increases costs and\nresponse time. But what if there were a\ncancer-defence mechanism that could\nbe applied to every single type of cancer,\nregardless of their particular set of muta-tions? Such a mechanism is not present\nin humans, but can be found in long-lived animals - one such creature being\nthe blind mole rat.\nThe blind mole rat paradox\nThe blind mole rat is a paradoxical\nspecimen that contradicts the general\nlaws of nature. It is a small animal, but\nsurprisingly can easily live for at least\n20 years - ten times longer than the\nsimilarly-sized common mouse. Despite\nbeing a social animal, in close contact\nwithothersofitskind,theblindmolerat\nrarelysuffersinfectiousdiseases.Theyare\nalso incredibly resistant to both natural\nand induced tumorigenesis compared\nto other mammals. This incredible\nanimal is undergoing thorough study by\ncancerologists, biogerontologists, and\nother researchers to understand what\nallows it to maintain its health against\nall of life\u2019s adversities.\nThe significance of\ntransposable elements\nScientists believe the blind\nmole rat\u2019s success may have do to\nwith retrotransposable elements, a\nspecific type of transposable element.\nTransposable elements (TEs) are short\nDNA sequences that do not encode\nproteins, nor perform any apparent\nfunction at first glance. They are\nexcellent at self-replication; the creation\nof hundreds of copies from a single TE,\nwhich can then be inserted into other\nparts of the genome.\nRetrotransposableelements(RTEs)the key to the blind mole rat\u2019s resistance\n- transcribe DNA into RNA, which\nis then transported from the nucleus\ninto the cytoplasm. RTEs also encode\nan enzyme called reverse transcriptase.\nInside the cytoplasm, this enzyme\nsynthesises new copies of DNA using\nthe transcribed RNA.\nRTEs as a defense\nmechanism against cancer\nResearchers found that, in the cells\nof blind mole rats,\nhigher levels of RTEs\nwere expressed before\nthe cells underwent\napoptosis. Also known\nas programmed cell\ndeath, apoptosis is an\nimmune response that\nalso prevents cells from\nbecoming cancerous. But\nhow is overexpression\nof RTEs beneficial for\napoptosis and how does\nit grant the mole rats\ntheir incredible cancer\nresistance?\nApoptosis is activated\nwhen DNA is found in\na cell\u2019s cytoplasm, which\nis considered a red flag\nby the cell, as DNA is\nnormally found in the\nnucleus. The more DNA is found in the\ncytoplasm, the stronger the response.\nThiscanhappenduringinfections,when\nsome viruses produce their DNA in the\ncytoplasm, but the same effect can also\nbe produced by overexpression of RTEs.\nAs RTEs produce DNA in the\ncytoplasm with the help of reverse\ntranscriptase, in a pre-apoptotic cell,\nhundreds of thousands of RTEs are\ntranscribing their DNA into RNA\nand each RNA molecule can produce\nhundreds and even thousands of DNA\ncopies.Thisemitsaverystrongsignalfor\ntheresponsethatcausescelldeath,sothe\ncell has no chance to become cancerous\nin the blind mole rat.\nBlind mole rats are not necessarily the\nmost beautiful animals, but they have\nunique biological features such as their\nabnormally long lifespans in relation to\ntheir body size. Although there is still a\nlongwaytogointhestudyofthisspecies,\ntheirabilitytousetransposableelements\nto their advantage is a mechanism that\ncan serve as inspiration for novel anti-cancer therapies.\nWang Guo Science Writer\nThe blind mole rat: an animal with\ncancer-resisting abilities\nScience writer Wang Guo discusses how blind mole rats can resist cancer and live long lives, and what that could mean\nfor the future of human healthcare.\nScan this QR code\nto access the\noriginal study:\nThe blind mole rat\u2019s incredible resistance to cancer has captured the interest of many researchers.\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\n\n"

I asked\nDr Harper to describe the benefits of\ncold-water swimming, and why natural\nresources like the blue swimming\nspaces on Hampstead Heath should be\nprotected so that everyone can reap the\nbenefits, regardless of income.\nDr Harper said, \u201cOutdoor swimming\nprovides a comprehensive \u2018package\u2019\nof proven mental and physical health\nbenefits, through green therapy, blue\ntherapy, exercise, community, and the\nunique properties of cold temperatures.\nBy providing free access to resources\nsuch as Hampstead Ponds, the benefits\nto the wellbeing of society far outweigh\nthe income generated.\u201d\nIn July 2020, the Save Our Ponds\ncampaign was launched to call on the\nCity of London Corporation to \u2013\naccording to the petition \u2013 \u201creverse\ntheir recent anti-democratic decision to\nimpose compulsory charges for entry to\nthe Hampstead Heath bathing ponds\u201d.\nThe petition mentions that the 1871\nHampstead Heath Act, which secures\n\u201cfree and open natural space for people\nto enjoy in perpetuity\u201d has been \u201cdiluted\nif not defiled\u201d by the City of London\nCorporation by charging for entry to\nthe ponds.\nMembers of the HMPA committee\nand survey respondents emphasised that\nsince the introduction of these charges,\nthe demographics of people visiting the\nponds have changed. One anonymous\nswimmer at the Ladies\u2019 Pond and Mixed\nPond said, \u201cI\u2019ve swum at the ponds for\n25 years and through the winter for 12\nyears. I am saddened by the changes\nthat have happened in the last few\nyears - the increases in charging and\nsubtle and not-so-subtle attempts by the\nHeath Management to commercialise\nthe pond, by making it less accessible to\npeople who really need and value it but\ncannot afford the entrance fee.\u201d\nThe HMPA are planning to recruit\na diversity officer to their committee,\nwho will be responsible for increasing\naccess and diversity at the Men\u2019s Pond.\nHowever, the committee members\nexplained that the scope of this role\nwould be far greater if the compulsory\ncharges were not in place. Whilst\nconcession rates are available, the fact\nthat many swimmers noticed a shift in\nthe backgrounds of people coming to\nthe ponds suggests that the concession\nrates are either too expensive, or that\nmany who cannot afford the full fee are\nineligible for the concession fee.\nThe Hampstead Heath swimming\ncommunity feels very inclusive. One\nswimmerattheLadies\u2019Pondsaid,\u201cThere\nare few places where women gather in\ncommunity and it feels important to\nhave spaces like that.\u201d A member of the\nHampstead Heath Winter Swimming\nClub said, \u201cWinter Swimming Club\nat the Mixed Pond creates a fantastic\ncommunity. It is straightforward to join\nand needs to be protected.\u201d However,\na swimmer at the Men\u2019s Pond said, \u201cI\nhave swum in the Men\u2019s Pond for nearly\n30 years and the whole experience has\nbeen adversely affected by the changes\nbrought in since COVID, including\nmandatory charging. It is a real pity\nthat others will not be attracted to the\nPond by open access and the previous\nquirkiness,includingnakedsunbathing.\u201d\nAt the end of May this year, the City\nof London Corporation banned naked\nsunbathing at the Men\u2019s Pond. In the\nCamden New Journal, Dan Carrier\ndescribed that the tradition of naked\nsunbathing dates back over 100 years.\nOne anonymous swimmer stated that\nnaked sunbathing at the Men\u2019s Pond is\nof \u201cnational importance to LGBTQ+\nhistory\u201d. There is concern amongst\nswimmers that the invoking of such\nrules and compulsory charges will make\nthe ponds less inclusive over time.\nThe City of London Corporation\nwere asked to explain why compulsory\ncharges are in place, why free swimming\nfor over 60s is only available between\n7:00 and 9:30a.m., and why naked\nsunbathing has been banned at the\nMen\u2019s Pond after almost a century. They\nrefused to provide a response.\nOverall, it seems that the compulsory\ncharges of swimming at the ponds and\nlido are reducing access of these sites for\nmany people who might benefit from\ncold-water swimming. For the ponds in\nparticular, which are natural resources\ndescribed by many as a source of mental\nhealth support, more work needs to\nbe done to ensure that access to these\nblue spaces is available to people from\nmany different backgrounds. Despite\nthe financial obstacles imposed by the\nCity of London Corporation, which\nare unlikely to change, the volunteer-led pond associations are determined to\nfind other approaches to increase access\nto these historical swimming sites.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something a little magical\nabout swimming whilst a massive\nheron swoops over your head to\nland or you spot a rare kingfisher\nflying into the bush - not quite a\nchlorinated indoor pool!\u201d\nSchool of Public Health (Faculty of Medicine) PhD students: Kelly McCain, Beth Cracknell Daniels, and Nilani Chandradeva (left to right) enjoying the breakfast and swimming event hosted by the Highgate Men\u2019s Pond Association (Saturday 15th April 2023).\nCredit: Nilani Chandradeva\n\n"

It\u2019s been over a year since I started\nswimming on the Heath, and I\u2019ve fallen\nin love with the tranquillity of the Ladies\u2019 Pond, and become fascinated by\nthe athletic commitment of swimmers\nat the Lido. I even enjoyed a trip to the\nMen\u2019s Pond when the Highgate Men\u2019s\nPond Association (HMPA) hosted a\nswim and breakfast for all open water\nswimmers.\nLocated in Zone 2 of North London,\nHampstead Heath has four swimming\nsites: the Kenwood Ladies\u2019 Pond, the\nHighgate Men\u2019s Pond, the Mixed Pond,\nandachlorinatedandunheatedopen-air\n60m swimming pool: Parliament Hill\nLido. The ponds and lido are open year-round and are supervised by lifeguards,\nalthough in winter the Mixed Pond is\nonly open to the Hampstead Heath\nWinter Swimming Club. These ponds\nare wild swimming sites, but bathing\nwater quality is monitored weekly by the\nEnvironment Agency.\nOver the past year of swimming\non the Heath, I have wondered what\ndraws swimmers there and what\nprevents more people from going. In\nMay 2023, I conducted an anonymous\nsurvey, circulated amongst different\nswimming groups and committees of\nthe three ponds and lido. The survey was\ncompleted by 140 swimmers.\nSwimmers commented on both the\nsignificance of being in nature, and the\nimpact that cold-water swimming has\non their mental health. One swimmer at\nthe Men\u2019s Pond said, \u201cThere\u2019s something\na little magical about swimming whilst\na massive heron swoops over your head\nto land or you spot a rare kingfisher\nflying into the bush - not quite like a\nchlorinated indoor pool!\u201d.\nOver 90% of respondents said they\nwere motivated to swim at the ponds\nor Lido due to mental health benefits.\nI asked Alastair Campbell \u2013 previously\nthe press secretary to former Prime\nMinister Tony Blair, and co-presenter\nof \u2018The Rest is Politics\u2019 podcast \u2013 to\ndescribe his experience of swimming at\nthe Lido.\n\u201cI have an addictive personality and\nthe cold-water swimming addiction is\nwhat I call a healthy one.\u201d he said. \u201cI got\ninto it when I stopped enjoying running\nas much as I used to, and bit by bit I was\nreally drawn into it \u2013 becoming almost\nlike a physical and mental need to start\nthe day. If you had said to me five years\nago that I would be willing the water to\nget colder, I would have thought you\nwere crazy. I remember the first time\nI got below 10\u02daC at the Lido, and I\ncouldn\u2019t believe I had done it\u2026 I don\u2019t\nknow why it helps my mental health.\nI just know that it does. There is also a\nreally good crowd of regulars at 7a.m.\nat the Lido, and I think we feed off each\nother in terms of how the swimming\nhelps us.\u201d\nThere is a growing body of evidence\naround the health benefits of cold-water\nswimming. In 2022, the first feasibility\nstudy on the impact of sea swimming\non depression was published in the\nMental Health and Physical Activity\njournal and showed a reduction in\nthe severity scores for depression and\nanxiety. Given emerging research and\nthe positive experiences reported by\nHampstead Heath swimmers \u2013 one\nof whom described swimming at the\nponds as a \u201cmental health workout\u201d\u2013 it\nis concerning that access to the Heath\u2019s\ncold-waterswimmingspacesisbecoming\nlimited by compulsory charges imposed\nby the City of London Corporation.\nUntil March 2020, it was free to swim at\nthe Hampstead Heath Ponds. Payments\nof \u00a32 or \u00a31 for adults and concessions\nrespectively could be volunteered by\nthose that could afford it and wished to\npay. Now charges of \u00a34.50 for adults and\n\u00a32.70 for concessions are compulsory.\nJeremy Watson and Mike Smith \u2013\nTreasurer and Chair respectively of\nthe HMPA \u2013 explained that whilst the\nHMPA, Mixed Pond Association, and\nKenwood Ladies\u2019 Pond Association\ntried to rally against the charges, there\nwas little opportunity to act as the\nintroduction of the charges was swiftly\nfollowed by the COVID-19 lockdown.\nThey also explained that whilst free\nswimming was available to people over\nthe age of 60 between 7:00 and 9:30\na.m., the time bracket did not coincide\nwith the free travel for over 60s offered\nby Transport for London.

The score\nis spectacular \u2014 each scene in the movie is perfectly\nequipped with excellent music that induces specific\nfeelings in the audience. The animations and artwork are superb and exceed those of the first film.\nA variety of themes are presented in the mov-ie. The protagonist, Miles Morales, is forced to\ngrapple with questions that everyone watching\nthe movie, at some point in their lives, has had to\ngrapple with as well. Will I live up to the expectations\nof me? How do I tackle new challenges that seem impossible to overcome? And does it make sense to follow nonsensical rules?\nSome characters who starred in the prequel movie,\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, make a return in\nAcross the Spider-Verse. An interesting range of new\ncharacters is also introduced, adding life to an exciting cast. The most interesting addition to the team of\nspider-people is Miguel O\u2019Hara. Miguel is interesting\nprimarily because he deviates from the happy-go-lucky,\njoke-cracking personality of most of the other spi-der-people. A stickler for obedience, he often clashes\nwiththeprotagonist.Miguelisbentondoingwhatever\nit takes to save as many human lives as possible, even if\nthat means sacrificing those close to him. This puts him\nat odds with Miles and adds to the host of problems\nMiles must face, including the new super-villain, the Spot.\nThe Spot is a powerful villain, possessing powers far exceeding those of the protagonist\u2019s previous rival. The stakes are much higher\nin Across the Spider-Verse, and a sense of dread fills the\nair whenever the Spot appears on screen, saying, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to take everything from you like you took everything from me.\u201d The injection of humour into pivotal\nmoments of the story was ill-conceived, and the relationship between the protagonist and Spider-Woman felt forced. Despite this, the movie\nwas brilliant.

The film\nadapts TE Lawrence\u2019s autobiography Seven Pillars of\nWisdom into a 210-minute, panoramic depiction of\nLawrence\u2019s journey in the Middle East during the Arab\nRevolt, with all its gruelling battles and tactical bril-liancies. However, though I can\u2019t say I disliked Lawrence of Arabia, I certainly was not enamoured by it.\nThis puts this review in an odd spot: it\u2019s a positive\nreview in the sense that I enjoyed watching the movie,\nbut a negative one in the sense that, to my uncultured\neyes, it wasn\u2019t, say, one of the greatest British films of\nall time, as the British Film Institute would claim. I\nleft the cinema feeling somewhat underwhelmed, but\nhaving a hard time articulating why: the acting was ex-cellent, the cinematography was world-class, the scope\nwas remarkable, but something wasn\u2019t clicking. Having sat on it, I think my main contention is that each\ncomponent of the movie \u2013 the score, the directing, the\ncinematography \u2013 did not adapt to the emotional arc\nof the story.\nWithout spoiling\ntoo much, the film\nis split into half \u2013\neach side of the intermission presents a\ndifferent narrative of\nLawrence\u2019s life. The\nfirst half shows a char-ismatic, force-of-nature\n\u2018great man\u2019, the type that\nwe love to deify and my-thologise, whereas the latter crumbles that image, reD\u2019Arabian \u00c6sert Film Writer\nExcellent acting, world-class cinematography, remarkable scope, but an underwhelming overall package\nnonetheless.\nFilm&TV\nFilm Review\n\n"

The UK has also built its fair share of\nDeco-style architecture, including the Barker Building\non High Street Kensington, as well as Eltham Palace.\nBrutalism\nBrutalism, like Baroque, is another marmite style; you\nloveoryouhateit.AlthoughitisnothinglikeBaroque,\nor any other style for that matter. The Bauhaus school\nfocused on the concept of \u2018simplicity\u2019 for its buildings,\nhowever, a new construction material had emerged\nwhich allowed Brutalism to take flight; concrete. Like\ntheRomanshaddiscoveredwithbrick,concretewasan\nincredibly cheap, easy to make, and portable building\nmaterial. As such, in the 1950s-1980s, with the postwar economic slump in full effect and with increased\nimmigration due to decolonisation, many countries\nneededbuildingsforthelowestpossiblecostandinthe\nquickest possible time.\nBrutalism is characterised by its liberal use of con-creteanditsverysimplisticlook,withnoarchesordec-orative stonework at all. For many, Brutalism is an apt\nname; it does have a rather brutal, pessimistic, and at\ntimes, ugly and depressing look. But perhaps this is the\nwrong way to look at it. At the time, Brutalism was the\nsummation of economic hardship and, in some places,\noppression; this view has perverted our view of Brutalism ever since. However, for the likes of Le Corbusier,\nBrutalismwasartandmodernityitselfandinsomecases we should treat it as such. Stunning examples of Brutalism include Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, the\nBarbican Centre, Robarts Library in Toronto, and the\nCity of Chandigarh purpose - built by Le Corbusier.\nInternational,\nPost-Modernism, and Futurism\nDeveloping on from the\nideas of Brutalism; of \u2018simplicity, minimalism, and\nfunctionality\u2019, came the\nInternational style. The\nInternational style was all\nthe rage from the 1950s to\nthe 1990s, as the style for\nall functional buildings. It\nis highlighted by its use of\nreinforced concrete, metal,\nand sheet glass, which was\na recent innovation. Most\nbuildings you find in the\nfinancial districts of developed or developing cities\nare built in this style, the\nchampion of which was\nMies van der Rohe.\nPost-modernism developed in the 1980s as a contrast to the international\nstyle. Many architects were\nfrustrated by the lack of imagination and ingenuity expressed in the International\nstyle, and sought to rid the\nworld of it. Post-modernism features eclectic mixes\nof architectural styles and\nstructures that can often be\nhard to define, but visual\nexamples include the Radisson Blu Astrid Hotel in\nAntwerp and PPG Place in\nPittsburgh.\nFuturism is a broad term\nused to describe a series of\narchitectural movements. Like the International style,\nthe Futurist movement makes liberal use of exposed\nmetalworkandsheetglass,butinsteadofbuildingrigid\nand blocky structures, developed unique spiralling and\ncontortedmetalwork.ExamplesincludethePompidou\nCentre in Paris and the Lloyd\u2019s Building in London.\nWhere does architecture go from here? That is an\nunknowable answer as in the last decade, architectural\nstyleshavedevelopedatsuchafastpacethatitisimpos-sible to predict when and how it will evolve next. But\nthis is, in essence, its downfall, as the fast-paced nature\nof today\u2019s society as well as the focus on economics has\nrestricted the styles that can emerge today and has led\nto the International and Modernist styles taking a firm\nhold. The Post-Modernist movement gave us a glimpse,\nhowever, at what revivalist architecture looks like in a\nmodern society, incorporating elements from many\ndifferent periods. However, these revivalist elements\nare only fleeting in their incorporation. Are we perhaps\noverdue a more permanent revivalist school of archi-tecture, or will simplicity and functionality remain the\nmain-stays of the modern world?\nThe Lloyd\u2019s Building, the City of London\nCredit: Rumman Amin/Unsplash\nThe Barbican, City of London\nCredit: Andreas Karamalikis/Unsplash\nBRUTALISM WAS ART\nAND MODERNITY ITSELF\nAND IN SOME CASES WE\nSHOULD TREAT IT AS\nSUCH\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "an expedition you will likely have your\nown unique challenges when organising\nit. This is just a note to say you should\nexpect them, especially if you are trying\nsomething ambitious.\nWhat started for me as a three-week\nchallenge \u2013 that I\u2019d save up my holidays\nfrom work to undertake - turned\ninto, \u201cI\u2019m going to quit my job and go\nclimbing for five months and spend all\nmy free time planning it\u201d. If you have\na small two-week trip to somewhere\naccessible, it might consume you, so be\nprepared.\nPart 2: The Expedition\nThe time spent in Alaska itself was\nroughly five weeks. The team\u2019s arrival\nwas staggered, as everyone spent a stint\nin the Alps beforehand on the Jonathan\nConville alpine preparation course.\nThe first day was rather delirious,\nand set a precedent for how the trip\nwould ensue. Ben and I were the first to\narrive, and wanting to make the most\nof the weather in the Alps, decided to\nwalk some routes the day before our\n7am flight to Anchorage. He and his\nteammate had an epic time and did not\nget off their route until 2am. At the\nlast minute they managed to find a taxi\ndriver that would drive\nhim from a small village\nin France back to the\ncampsite, to frantically\npack his belongings, and\nthen drive him an hour or\nso on to Geneva airport. I\nmade it to the airport at\naround 11pm wearing the\nsame clothes I climbed in\nand the same sweat. Sleep\nbecame impossible, as I\nstressed about the other\nmembers, and tried to\nfigure out a backup plan,\nas Ben had the tent! Alas\nhe arrived just in time at\naround 4:30am.\nAfter we miraculously arrived in\nAlaska, we travelled straight from\nAnchorage to a small village called\nTalkeetna.Weendeduphavingdinnerin\nthat small hippy town that looked like it\nwas straight from a great western movie\n\u2013 it felt like a fever dream. Jake arrived a\nday or two later after choosing a cheap\nflight that took two days with numerous\nlayovers. The week was spent completing\nthe planning for the expedition (by\ngoing to the rangers office, talking to\nmountain guides, and liaising with the\nair taxi), eating lots, and drinking with\nthe locals. When the rest of the team\narrived, it was a day or two of frantic\npreparations as we got everything ready\nto spend two weeks camping on the Pika\nglacier.\nDuring the flight on the little plane\nthat had only six passenger seats, my\nmouth hung wide open. I had never\nseen so many sharp and rugged granite\npillars condensed in such a small place,\nall poking out of soft snow. It looked\nlike a play ground for rock climbers. It\nwas a beautifully clear day. We stepped\noff the plane, put our belongings on\nsledges, and dragged them over to where\nwe would set up base camp a few metres\nfrom the glacier air landing strip.\nIt would take me much too long to\nwrite everything we did on the glacier in\nthis article (we were there for 16 days!),\nbut check out our trip report if you want\nto see what routes we climbed \u2013 and a\nday-by-day breakdown of what we got\nup to \u2013 by scanning the QR Code on\nthe previous page. The key things that\nstick out for me from that time were:\neach peak took roughly 20 hours (time\ndidn\u2019t matter so much in the land of\nthe midnight sun), when we weren\u2019t\nclimbing we were either asleep or stuck\nin the tent because it was raining, and\nour base camp was incredibly beautiful.\nAnd of course, how could I forget\nthe time on the glacier when we were\nstuck in the tents for an extra four days,\nwith the weather having turned so bad\nthat the pilot couldn\u2019t come and collect\nus. When he did finally get us, he only\nhad a one-hour window, otherwise we\nwould\u2019ve been stuck for another five\ndays or so. At this point we also ran\nout of all the nice food, and nobody\nwanted to cook as it would mean getting\ndrenched. So it was nuts for breakfast,\nnuts for lunch, and if we were lucky, rice\nand beans for dinner.\nThis part of the expedition will stick\nin my mind for a long time. The sheer\nbeauty of the glacier meant I was in\nan almost constant state of awe. Also.\nthere was the mental strain of living on\nit - not really from boredom or isolation\n- but rather the risks that constantly\nsurrounded us. After completing a route,\nI always felt lucky when we returned\nto base camp. I would cherish my life\na little bit more and it was always my\nbrain, more than my body, that needed\na few days of rest before venturing back\nout from the safety of our tents again.\nThe glacier deteriorated more and more\nas we were there and by the end rock\nfall noises were almost constant. These\nnoises served as reminders of the risks\naround us.\nBut we survived! And when we finally\nmade it back to non-cravassed land, lots\nof rest was in order. We then wanted\nto go rock climbing without being\nsurrounded by risks so set out to climb\nin Alaska\u2019s finest crags!\nUnfortunately, the glacier wasn\u2019t\nthe only place where the weather was\nbad. It was raining almost everywhere\nin Alaska. Fairbanks was the only dry\nplace so we decided to brave the six-hour\ndrive and check it out. Bad idea. Worst\ndecision I made as expedition leader. If I\ncould describe the climbing in Fairbanks\nwith one word it would be: Mosquito.\nSwarms of them! My deepest apologies\nto Ben, who had to spend his last few\ndays of Alaska in Fairbanks. Still, there\nwas a nice museum.\nThings perked up after a few days in\nFairbanks, as the weather was looking\ngood in Hatcher Pass for a week! Really\ngood actually. I had messaged the author\nof the guide book for Alaska climbing,\n(Kelsey Grey) for advice on whether\nit would be good to go when it was\nraining. There wasn\u2019t really anywhere\nto go (evidenced by the fact we went to\nFairbanks), but it did mean we were now\nin contact with the legendary Kelsey\nGray!\nHewasinsanelyfriendlyandweended\nup climbing with him for that week. He\nlet us stay in his cabin, taught us how to\nclean and bolt routes, amd how to fish\nand smoke salmon \u2013 a fun experience.\nWe bolted a route and did a team first\nassent, naming it \u2018A Nightmare of Black\nBears\u2019. We actually even saw a black bear\n(it was terrifying).\nAnd that was that! I am so grateful\nthat we got to do something like this,\nand so proud of the team for how much\nwe learnt and what we pulled off!

But on an intuitive\nlevel, what do you identify more with?\nI asked a total of 50 people this\nquestion \u2013 23 women and 27 men. For\nmen, 17 answered sperm while the other\n10 picked egg. Contrastingly, 19 women\nanswered egg while the rest picked\nsperm. It appears that the answers are\ngendered, with men generally picking\nspermandwomenpickingegg;agender-matched rate of 63% for men and 83%\nfor women. I couldn\u2019t identify any\nqualitative trends in those who went\nagainst the grain, though there was one\ninteresting instance where a son and\nhis mother both gave non-gendered\nresponses \u2013 maybe something in the\nblood. Another fun result was that Bard\nanswered egg, whereas ChatGPT, with\nsome persuasion, said sperm.\nSo what does this mean? Are the men\nwho answered egg more effeminate\nthan those who answered sperm? Are\nbisexual people more likely to give\nnon-gendered answers, as one of my\ninterviewees suggested? The answer to\nall these questions is: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m\nnot a psychoanalyst.\nOne interesting theory is that the\ngendered way in which the egg and the\nsperm are portrayed in media informs\nour identifications.

    "content": "Despite the many opportunities to\nstrayintoescapismanddetachment\nfrom the realities of its readers that\nit presents, fiction is often stuck with\nbeing \u2018of its time and place\u2019. Rarely do\nwe see a book or a movie carry its plot\nwith an internal logic distinct from that\nof our own. Even the most fantastical\nof science fiction and fantasy that are\nset in the most outlandish settings rely\non tropes, themes, and archetypes that\nhave somehow remained consistent\nthroughout human history.\nThis isn\u2019t an accident or a bad thing\n\u2013 these constraints allow for clearer\ncommunication of the author\u2019s ideas\nto the reader, allowing for a more\nimmediate and direct understanding of\nthe story\u2019s meaning.\nThinking of novels like The Brothers\nKaramazov, or The Magic Mountain,\nwhere the communication of ideas takes\npriority over realism - the characters\ndo not act or speak as humans, as\nthe conceit of a fictional story would\nsuggest, but as mouthpieces for the\ntheological or political stances that\nwere prevalent during the times that the\nbooks were written. For Dostoevsky and\nMann, the aim of fiction wasn\u2019t merely\nto tell a story \u2013 a narrative spinning on\nits own, independent of anything else -but to use it as a medium through which\nthey could present their thoughts and\nengaged with their audience.\nRecently, I came across two movies\nthat do a similar thing. Memories of\nMurder, directed by Bong Joon-Ho and\nreleased in 2003, follows two detectives\nas they investigate a string of rapes and\nmurders that occurred in Korea in the\nlate 1980s. The investigation is a mess,\nwith bureaucracy slowing down every\nstep of the procedure, and the brittle\negos of the detectives devolving the\neffort into a desperate chaos.\nNotably,MemoriesofMurderisloosely\nbased on real-life events: a string of rapes\nand murders between 1986 and 1991 by\na killer who was, at the time of the film\u2019s\nrelease, uncaught - a conscious choice\nby Bong. This period in South Korean\nhistory can be characterised as one of\npolitical and social turmoil, one which\nsaw the end of a militaristic dictatorship\nafter a decade of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats, revolts,\nand massacres, but one which also saw\nthe country\u2019s strides into modernity,\nfor example with Seoul\u2019s hosting of the\n1988 Summer Olympics. The film, as it\nportrays its incompetent and desperate\ncharacters try and ultimately fail to find\nmeaning among the kaleidoscope of half\nclues and coincidences, constantly asks\nthe audience, many of whom must\u2019ve\nlived through that time themselves, to\nremember and engage in that cognitive\ndissonance once again.\nDavey Chou\u2019s Return to Seoul,\nreleased last month, depicts Freddie\nBeno\u00eet, an adopted daughter, going\nback to South Korea to try and find\nher biological parents. Each meeting\nbetween the family has the awkwardness\nand difficulty of any such gathering,\nexacerbated by the language barrier.\nThe film portrays where Freddie is in\nlife, at several points over the course of\na decade, each time she meets again with\nher biological family, hopping between\njobs and partners.\nIn spite of the protagonist\u2019s magnetic\nconfidence and aptitude, both of\nwhich serve her well through each\ncheckpoint of the movie, there is a sense\nof inevitable futility in every attempt\nat reconciliation, no matter what the\nclich\u00e9s about how time heals and the\nunbreakable bonds between family may\nsay. There is a constant resigned look in\nher eyes that dislodges any presentation\nof self-assuredness, which neither the\naudience nor the film\u2019s characters fail to\nnotice.\nThe feeling of distance and lack of\nfamiliaritywithone\u2019sfamilyandnational\nidentity is one that has materialised\nmultiple times during the nation\u2019s recent\nhistory, for example, in the multiple\ntelevision broadcasts that attempted to\nreunite families separated by the Korean\nWar, such as 1983\u2019s 453-hour Finding\nDispersed Families program.\nInbothofthesemovies,Idon\u2019tfeellike\nas though the stories and settings were\nincidental. Bong\u2019s decision to portray a\nspecific historical event, as opposed to a\ndisconnected fictional invention, seems\ndeliberate. Chou\u2019s engagement with\nthe topic of family and immigration is\none that particularly resonates with his\naudience. He does not intend simply\nto tell a story, but instead to use it as a\nvehicle to articulate the experiences and\nemotions attached to a place and time.\nAs I watched these two movies, I felt\nthat, as much as I enjoyed the narratives\non their own - brilliantly acted and\ndirected as they were - it was the way\nthat I could interact with the stories\nthrough my own experiences that made\nthem meaningful.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n12 comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nWhen did fiction get so political?\nAnonymous Comment Writer\nComment\nCredit: IMDb\nEdited by: Elif Civelekoglu\nMemories of Murder by Bong Joon Ho (2003) Return to Seoul by Davey Chou (2023)\nA look at the role of history and identity in Memories of Murder and Return to Seoul\n\n"

I just need remember to film that\nday but otherwise it doesn\u2019t take any\ntime.\nFelix: Which post was your favourite\nso far?\nRosemary: Oh my God, that\u2019s hard.\nLet me let me look. I like the ones where\nI\u2019m with friends. I can rewatched them\nevery now and then and think \u201cOh my\nGod that was such a fun day\u201d. Rosemary\nscrolling through her phone. Oh, this was\nreally cool. There are photos my mum\ntook of Morocco and these are from\nwhenwewenttoAntarcticaandshetook\nthese photos and I think it\u2019s cool sharing\nthese memories. It is not like anything\nI\u2019ve ever had before. I\u2019m pretty sure they\nuse the juice from the duck when they\nroast it and I\u2019m pretty sure they put that\ninto the sauce because you can taste the\nstrong duck umami from it, but there\u2019s\nalso a hint of sweetness, and it\u2019s almost\nperfect. Then they serve it with rice and\nsome salad.\nFelix: Where is your favorite sushi\nplace that you\u2019ve been to?\nRosemary: I do love sushi. Here\u00b4s\nthe thing with sushi. There is a skill\nrequirement. You have to be able to cut\nthe sashimi right in order for the fibers\nto align properly so it melts properly in\nyour mouth. But then for me, I think the\nmore important part is how the rice is\ncooked, what type of rice they use, and\nalso the actual quality of the sashimi.\nThe best I\u2019ve had is at The Araki. It\u2019s\nincredible; they make it in front of you.\nTheir rice is insane and I think it\u2019s the\nchef\u2019s wife or someone\u2019s family and they\ngrow the rice and they give it directly to\nthe restaurant. It\u2019s not the normal white\nricebecausethere\u2019sabitofcolortoitand\nthey serve it lukewarm, not cold or hot.\nFelix: Do you like any African cuisine?\nRosemary: Yes but so far I have only\neaten Moroccan food. However, since\nI met Hannah I\u2019ve been doing a lot of\nMiddle Eastern cuisine which I really\nlike. There is this really good plant-based\nMiddle Eastern restaurant called Bubala\nin Soho. The hummus and the Baba\nghanoush are so good there. There are a\ncoupleofgoodplacesinNottingHillfor\nMiddle Eastern food.\nFelix: Where are some of the nicest\nplaces in London to eat well? You\u2019ve\nmentioned Notting Hill and a lot in\nMayfield.\nRosemary: Hmmm, I think it\ndepends on what type of food you want.\nIf you just want like a quick meal then\nSoho is amazing because obviously,\nyou have Chinatown for all the good\nAsian restaurants. If you want a bougie\nsit-down vibe or if you want an actual\nexperience then you should go to\nKnightsbridge or Mayfair. I find the\ncentre the worst.\nFelix: Do you ever go for Chinese,\nKorean, or Malaysian food?\nRosemary: Yeah of course. Korean is\none of my favorite cuisines but there is\nnot much around. Also, with Korean\nand Chinese food it\u2019s the more people\nthe better because with those two\ncuisines you want to be able to order a\nlot of stuff. However, when my parents\nwere here, we would go invite a couple\nof friends and get a big table. At Imperial\nit\u2019s hard to get a massive group - I\u2019m\ntalking like eight to 10 people - to go eat.\nFelix: What\u2019s your favorite health food\nplace?\nRosemary: Honestly my house.\nFelix: Is there anything that you\u2019ve\nnoticed about restaurants that were\noverhyped or can you give our readers\nsomeadviceaboutwhichthingstolook\nout for before going to a restaurant?\nRosemary: TikTok plays a big role\nin this because a lot of content creators\ncreate videos that will pop off and then\neveryone jumps on the bandwagon. Left\nand right you will see people go, \u201cOh\nmy God you have to go to this place\u201d.\nOne that especially stands out for me\nis Jacuzzi, this Italian restaurant. It is\nowned by the Big Mama group, which is\nknown to have over-the-top decorations,\nand to me, it\u2019s almost superfluous and\nunnecessary, but TikTok loves that\nbecause it looks so good on camera. The\ntwist is that I find the pizza okay. Don\u2019t\ntrust anything that you repeatedly saw\non TikTok.\nSome special tapas from Rincon Di\nDiego in Barcelona.\nRincon Di Diego in Barcelona, Spain.\nMajide in Barcelona.\nCredit: Rosemary Sun\nCredit: Rosemary Sun\nCredit: Rosemary Sun\n\n"
