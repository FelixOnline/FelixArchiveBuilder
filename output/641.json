SEND\nIMPERIAL TO THE ARCTIC\nBE GENEROUS\nTOMORROW!\nGary\nJohan Giovanni Franco Mike \u00a3* AS Marianne\nMel\nJanet\nFrom parts of Iceland the tops of the\nGreenland mountains can be seen on a clear\nday, and it was two Icelanders who mounted\nthe first recorded expedition to the largest\nisland in the world, when, in 980 they led a small party across Denmark Strait, landed\non the east coast, and spent the winter there.\nThe first true exploration of the coastal\nregions was carried out by Eric 'the Red'\nThorvaldsson. During his three year exile\nfrom Iceland, for murder, he visited and\nexplored much of the east and west coasts of\n'the land to the west'.He was extremely\npleased with himself, believing that he had\nfound the answer to Iceland's population\nproblem. On returning home he embarked\non a highly effective publicity campaign for\nthe colonisation of the country he\ncalculating ly named Greenland - it sounded\nso much more friendly than Iceland.\nSettlements were indeed formed, but by\nabout the 15th Century, the visible signs of a Norse culture had disappeared as a result of\nthe settlers' absorption into the Eskimo\npopulation.\nDavis, Baffin, Hudson, Ross, Pirry\nFranklin, Nordenskjold. Peary - the r il of\nhonour of explorers - all visited and explored\nthe Greenland coast. But, when the great\nNansen first accomplished the crossing of\nthe ice-cap in 1888. it was still thought that\nfertile valleys and green pastures lay\nsomewhere in the middle of this polar\nsubcontinent. Now, there are only Early\nWarning System radar stations. Since then\nmuch invaluable geographical and scientific\nresearch has been carried out by a large\nnumber of countries, primarily on\nexpeditions such as the one at present being\nplanned at College.\nImperial have already been to Greenland,\nthe largest island in the world (the area of\nwhich is nine times that of Britain ) but\nwhilst the expedition in 1966 went further\nNorth and remained on the ice - free coastal\nmountains, this latest scientifically\norientated venture will experience the ice -cap, second in size only to Antarctica, at\nPogelOl\nmuch closer quarters when half the team of\neight leave the permanent base - camp and\nhead inland and on to the ice. They are\nexpected to take four weeks to complete\ntheir investigation of the spider population\non the ice - surrounded outcrops of rock. .\nThey will be self - sufficient during this\nperiod and will man haul sledges through the\nthree main crevasse belts which form the\ncoastal ice-fall.\nAll eight members will be together for the\nother two weeks spent in the field; training\nreconnaissance and acclimatization all have\nto be completed, and arrangements will be\nfinalised so that the base-camp team will be\nsuccessful in the major undertaking of\ncarrying out a plant distribution and\ninteraction survey, during the four weeks\nthat they are alone.\nBut what does all this expedition stuff\ninvolve, anyway? Is it all 'Boys' Own'-type\nheroes, all alone against the force of nature?\nWill there be 1 ! carpets and a band, there to\ngreet us, upon our return to Heathrow?\nWill our bold and beloved leader be\nknighted?! No, but the multi-departmental\nteam will be facing temperatures as low as\n-40\u00b0 (ef fec ive), winds of up to 100 miles\nper hour, ..nd all this on only one Mars Bar\nper day! Spending seven weeks in a tent may\nbe some peoples' idea of fun \u2014 it isn't too bad; until you find yourself having to go\noutside in a blizzard to clear the tent of\nsnow, every two hours; until the zips freeze\njust when you need to go outside; until the\nicicles start forming on the inside of the\ntent... No doubt we'll all be craving for a Mooney's, long for the wide open spaces and\nprivacy of a Beit Hall shared room, lectures\nwill be a welcome break in the excitement (!).\nWhy go then? Why choose to inflict so much\ndiscomfort (and danger) on ourselves?\nPass (!).\nThe time spent in the field, however, is\nonly the public side of the expedition; the\nmajority of the work and effort takes place\nat home, planning the expedition. In order\nthat the expedition is able to leave for the\nHH HH IHl March 23, 1 9 8 3 MM B chosen country, funds have to be raised\n(through sponsorship, gifts in kind, hire or\nloan of articles, etc) and this is possibly the\nmost difficult and important thing of all;\nthe team has to be sure that they and their\nequipment are good enough to cope with\nthe actual expedition period (training and\nchoice of equipment) and that everything\nand everybody will be in the right place at\nthe right time (travel and freight arrange-ment s), etc. So, how is the East Greenland\nexpedition doing? We've won the support\nand backing of various influential people\nand organisations, including the official\n'go-ahead' from the Danish government.\nWe've received various donations to date,\nincluding radios from Marconi, dehydrated\nfood from Ravenscroft, syrup and sugar\nsupplies from Tate and Lyle, and photographic film from Kodak. About half the I actual capital required has been raised, I primarily through our personal contrib u It ions and an Exploration Board award, but\nthe situation is becoming rather worrying\nsince potential sources of money are\nbeginning to run out! It is because of this\nthat we are turning to you, the Imperial\nCollege student, and beg you to help us out:\ntomorrow, Thursday, the team members\nwill be in their respective departments, and\nthroughout College, appealing to your\ngenerosity and asking you to contribute to\nour funds. Melanie Hiorns, the leader of the\nexpedition, will be collecting in Mech Eng;\nGary Wong and Mike Fletcher in Physics;\nGiovanni Vaciago in Civ Eng; Johan\nKuylenstierna, Marianne Parkinson and\nJanet Horrocks in Life Sciences; and Franco\nTurrinelli in Chem Eng. We're sure you\nagree that it would be a shame if this\ngenuinely ambitious and interesting project\nwere to be grounded without being given a chance, and, as it states in our request-for-sponsorship letter, 'the smallest contribution is of enormous importance to us'.\nPlease help send Imperial to Greenland.\nFranco Turrinelli\nIFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Style\nI hadn't intended to reply to the\ninevitable response (Page 4) to\nmy criticism of Pallab Ghosh's election publicity, but since\nPallab has specifically asked me\nto, and since he has badly\nmisquoted me, I shall.\nIn his letter Pallab writes 'It is\ncertainly not my intention to\nencourage a split between the\nUnion and College'. I'm glad to\nhear it, but surely, if this is his\nattitude, it was misleading to\nwrite in his publicity 'A controversial newspaper can easily lead\nto the oft quoted \"us and them\"\nsituation'.\nSecondly, Pallab criticises me\nfor saying that an outspoken\ncampaigning FELIX wouldn't be taken seriously. What I said\nwas that a deliberately antagonistic FELIX will not be taken\nseriously, something I still\nbelieve to be true.\nThirdly, I am accused of not\noffering relevant comment. As\nan example, it is pointed out that\nI have said nothing about the\nEDITORIAL\npatently ridiculous aspects of the\nLauwerys Report on Residence.\nThis is for the very good reason\nthat I prefer my Editorials to\nexpress my own directly-formed\nopinions, and not base them on\nsecond-hand information gleaned from Union cheese and wine\nparties. The Lauwerys Report is\nnearly a hundred pages long and\nI haven't had time to read it yet.\nHas Pallab I wonder?\nApart from Lauwerys, I admit, I haven't commented on\nmany aspects of student life.\nSpecifically, I have restricted my\neditorials to mascot ry, sexism in\nthe Union, procedural wrangling s at UGMs, FELIX news\nstyle, Mary Freeman, bar-accounts, fire alarms, apathy\non Council, the Southside move,\nthe Guildshit affair, the new\nrefectory, Harlington gravel,\nCollege's attitude to the water\nstrike, Mines Review, Union\ndemocracy, Exec Torture,\nsabbatical elections...There's so\nmuch to say without carping at\nCollege all the time. Of course\nMooney meals are awful. I know\nthat, you know that, and all of\nCollege knows it too; is there\nanything to be gained by saying\nso every week? I don't think so.\nIt has been said (by Steve\nMarshall, actually) that the\nFELIX Editor should produce\nthe kind of FELIX he himself\nwould like to read, were he not\ninvolved in the Union. I have\ntried to do this, and the result\nhas been a FELIX which I would describe as more serious\nand responsible, and Pallab\nwould describe as lacking in\nbiting satire and with no sense of\nfun. Some people prefer my\nFELICES, some will prefer his.\nIt doesn't worry me much either\nway.\nSmall Ads\nSmall Ads got out of hand this\nweek. Lots of them were anonymous (straight in the bin) or\nobscene (ditto) or pseudo-ny mou s( thrown out if we detect\nthem). But despite that, we still\nhad to cut over three-quarters of\nall the 'silly' small ads submitted\nbecause there just isn't space for\nthem.

As usual, he was being\ncriticised for his authority's decision to demolish the old\ntown hall, but the point which\ncaused most amusement in the\nFELIX Office was the way The\nTimes reported that when his\nopinions were challenged, he\nstoutly defended them.\nI March\nI PROMISE faithfully that this\nwill be my last jibe at Andy\nGrimshaw this term. As you\nmay recall, after the hassle of\nelections had subsided, Andy\npresented the FELIX news staff\nwith a detailed breakdown of the\nvoting figures, which we printed\ndirectly on the cover of the last\nFELIX. Did any of you notice\nthat they didn't add up?\nI'M SURE you've all heard of\nParkinson's Law: work expands\nto fill the time available. Rather\nless well known, but just as\nvalid, is the Peter Principle:\nevery individual is promoted to\nhis own level of incompetence.\nIn other words, if you do your\njob well, then sooner or later you\nwill get promoted; if you do the\nnew job well, you will get\npromoted from that, too, until\neventually you are promoted to\na job which is beyond your\ncapabilities, and there you stay,\nundeserving of further pro-motion, promoted to your own\nlevel of incompetence.\nBut to my knowledge, there is\nonly one man who has applied\nthe Peter Principle in reverse,\nnamely th t if you start high\nenough up with a job you do\nbadly, it is possible to work your\nway down the ladder until,\nsooner or later, you will arrive at\na job you can do with some\ndegree of ability.\n23, 1 9 8 3 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00bb \u2022 \u00ab \u2022 \u2022\nThe name I have in mind is\nJohn Passmore.

As many of you\nwill know, Phil Greenstreet was\nelected to the post of Deputy\nPresident last year, but was\nunable to take up his appointment because he failed his final\nyear exams, so is not of 'aca-demi c standing'. As a result, Phil\nhas been earning his living\nworking in the Union Bar, and\none evening he was at his post\nengaged in conversation with\nMark Smith, last year's FELIX\nEditor. Phil had made some\nsmall joke at Mark's expense,\nand Mark turned to the rest of\nhis friends in mock outrage.\n'Bloody cheek of these bar\nstaff!' he stormed.

I feel, you\nhave singularly failed to do this\nyear. A case in point is the\nrecently released Lauwerys\nreport on residence\u2014there was\nnot one word of editorial\ncomment.\nThe FELIX Editor has the\nunique advantage to be able to\nsay what he (and students) really\nfeel about such short-sighted,\nhalf-baked proposals that\n! regularly emanate from College.\nThese reports are written by\n| people who, like yourself, are\ni totally out of touch with the\npeople they are dealing with,\nunable to appreciate the very\nreal problems faced by students.\nYour failure to give a positive\nreaction against some of the\nmore patently ridiculous aspects\nof the Lauwerys Report has left\nCollege with the impression that\nstudents are quite happy with\ndrastic rent increases and a; reduction of security guards,\nsub wardens and messengers.\nNext year's President is now in a far weaker negotiating position\ni with College than she would\nI have been otherwise.\nYou stated in your editorial\ni that an outspoken, campaigning\nFELIX wouldn't be taken\nPage 41\nseriously.

Page 3\nof this issue bears an advertisement placed by a shop called\n'American Retro'. The Advertisement takes the form of a photograph of what is, to my\nnaive eyes, a rather dated\nchemistry set containing,\namongst other things, cigarette\npapers, peculiar looking pipes,\nsmall spoons and mirrors. Some\nof my learned friends have told\nme that these devices are\noccasionally to be seen in the\nhands of junkies and drug\naddicts.\nAlthough I feel that Mr\nGhosh ought to be congratulated for his initiative in finding\nsuch an advertisement I wonder\nwhether he will continue to use\nthis particular advertiser when\nhe is FELIX Editor next year.\nFollowing your precedent of\ngiving away seaweed in the\nXmas issue of FELIX might not\nMr Ghosh be tempted to distribute a more pungent and narcotic weed next year?\nShall we be reading articles\nextolling the virtues of magic\nmushrooms or else finding little\nplastic bags of white powder\namongst the pages of our\nfavourite newspaper?\nFriday morning lectures\ncould be quite mind-blowing\nnext year.\nYours\nMichael J MacClancy\nBig City\nBlues\nDear Martin\nI read with avid interest the\nhighly sensitive article submitted\nby Don Adlington.

For the majority of fresher s, everything sorts\nitself out and they then go on to\nhave the time of their lives.\nIn my opinion, students do,\non the whole, tend to be fairly\ncushioned at university in\nrelation to the public at large\n(hence the popularity of further\ndegrees?). The cost of living for\nstudents is matched with their\nlow income (student reductions\netc).

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nULU\nMarathon\nNew barriers of human endurance\nwere broken last Saturday when\nthe annual meeting of the University of London Union's General\nUnion Council lasted for a staggering eight hours.\nThis was mainly due to the\ndisruptive tactics of students\nfrom Kings College who had\nnominated about thirty joke\ncandidates for all the UL U sabbatical and non-sabbatical\nposts.\nThe elections for student\nmembers of the Senate were held\nfirst, starting at 11:00am. There\nwere no joke candidates in this\nsection and all passed fairly\nsmoothly. Then delegates had an\nhour off for lunch. The election\nBar Loss\nJimmy Carroll, manager of the\nUnion Bar, has left his post\nfollowing a disagreement with\nCollege over the accuracy of bar\naccount audits. Mr Carroll has\nbeen Bar Manger for 3 years.\nCollege Finance and Refectory administrators had been\ncarrying out a series of checks,\npartly because of the imminent\nexpiry of the current bar licence\nand partly as a tightening up\nprocedure brought about by\ntight economic conditions. A recently introduced auditing\nsystem recently revealed a discrepancy in the accounts, and\na dispute developed over the\nsystem. Geoffrey Reeves, Chief\nSecurity Officer, is confident\nthat the new system is accurate,\nbut bar staff have disagreed, and\nat a meeting with Refectory\nadministrators on Thursday Mr\nCarroll felt that he was accused\nof financial mis man ag ment of financial mismanagement.\nCollege authorities have\nstressed that they have every\nfaith in the students who work\npart-time behind the bar.\nNo. 641 \u2022 k^M HH HH for President provided a foretaste of what was to come. Even\nthough only five of the joke\ncandidates had turned up and\nfour were having their speeches\nmade for them, the proceedings\nlasted for some time. The joke\ncandidates made speeches\ncondemning the state of ULU\nand the NUS, saying it had no\nrelevance to the vast majority of\nstudents. The speeches on behalf\nof candidates not present\nincluded readings from The\nDaily Telegraph, a hymn book,\nold manifestos and poetry\nbooks.\nMichael George was elected to\na non-sabbatical position because one of the serious candidates was disqualified on a technicality. Commenting about\nthe tactic by Kings College,\nDavid Josse, a Kings member of\nthe ULU executive, said that it\nhad been his idea but that he\nnever expected it to actually be\ncarried out. Nevertheless he\nthought it had made a valid\npoint about the unrepresentative\nnature of ULU.\nFIRE IN\nBEIT!\nTwo students filling a gas-fuelled\ncigarette lighter in a corridor of\nBeit Hall started a fire last\nSunday week.\nThe students allowed gas to\nleak from a canister, forming a cloud which ignited when they\ntested the lighter.

It originated in Tuscany and\ncentred on Florence: Dante Alighieri chose the\nTuscan language to write his epic poem 'La\nDivina Comedia' and described a fellow\nFlorentine. Giovanni Cimabue, as one of the\n\\ most famous painters of the day.\nCimabue was active between 1272 and 1302\nand was the first great artist of the Florentine\nSchool: together he and Giotto, his pupil and\nmore famous successor, mark the break with\nthe 'mani era gr eca' \u2014 the rigid aesthetic\nconventions of the Byzantine style which had\nmaintained its influence in Italy since the early\nMiddle Ages. Currently on show at the Royal\nAcademy is the great Cimabue Crucifix,\ncommissioned in 1287 for the new Franciscan\nchurch of Santa Croce in Florence. The\nCrucifix is over 14ft high and originally hung on\na choir screen which crossed the whole width\nof the church at the 5th bay of the nave.\n3 November 1966\nSo, OK, it's an artistic landmark...but why\nshould Olivetti be financing the Crucifix on a tour round Europe? As a testimonial, maybe,\nnot only to a superb work of art, but also to the\nlove (even, the need?) of civilised man for such\nart.\nLet me expand.\nOn the night of 3/4 November 1966 the\nArno broke its banks flooding the city of\nFlorence with mustard-coloured water, sludge\nand diesel oil. In some parts the oily mess\nreached well above first floor level: one of the\nworst affected areas was that round Santa\nCroce. Only after three days was it possible to\nreach the Cimabus Crucifix in the church's Museo dell'Opera. It had been almost\ncompletely submerged and the flood waters\nIREVIEWSI\nhad washed away considerable areas of paint,\nas well as soaking through the painted surface\nto the ges so and canvas beneath and\nwater logging the wooden support.\nOver the next ten years the Crucifix was\npainstakingly restored and one room at the\nRoyal Academy is full of photos recording each\ncliff-hanging step of the process. The areas of\nmissing paint have not been touched-up but\nfilled in with a cross-hatching of primary\ncolours, a technique called 'colour a bst rac tion'. These are integrated by the eye to\nproduce the same tone as the surrounding\npainted areas\u2014well that's the idea\u2014it works\nfar better close up than from a distance, but\nhardly detracts from Cimabue's achievement.\nNo chocolate-box sentimentality\nCimabue's Crucifix gives artistic expression to\nthe human ising ideology of the Franciscans.\nChrist c rut if i ed suffers-He is no triumphant,\nimmortal saviour. His body hangs heavily; the\ncurves are eloquent under His transparent\nloincloth; His face is an agony of chiaroscuro.\nIf you believe in the Christian version of\nGod, perhaps 'sublime' is an appropriate\nadjective. Setting aside religious connotations,\nthis image of raw emotion is profoundly\nmoving. It's a great pleasure to have an\nexhibition built round just one work\u2014it's possible to spend time absorbing it gently,\nwithout the pressure of '4 more galleries before\nclosing time'.\nWhere, When, E? The Cimabue Crucifix is at the Royal\nAcademy, Piccadilly, W l, until April 4; open\n10-6 daily, including Good Friday and Easter\nSunday. Admission 50p for students,\notherwise \u00a31.\nIC\nOrchestra\nIC Orchestra's ambitious programme\nconsisted of three works: Walton's Portsmouth Point, Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto\nNo 1 and Mahler's First Symphony.\nIC\nChoir\nI walked into the Great Hall last Friday evening\nfor IC Choir's100 th concert clutching my\ncomplimentary ticket and accompanied by\nthree 'complimentary' friends, and thought for\na moment that some strange supernatural\nforce had transported us to the Royal Albert\nHall for the last night of the Proms: a profusion\nof \"flowers decked the stage and a number of\n'promenaders' were milling about trying to find\nseats.\n1 pounced on the last reserved seat, but my\nfriends had the doubtful privilege of being\nseated on the side aisle steps, where they bore\na high risk of being trampled by the inevitable\ncontingent of concert-goers who get caught\nshort three minutes from the end and leave the\nauditorium as noisily as possible.\n\u2022In the silence following the entry of the\nconductor, Eric Brown, I waited in trepidation\nfor the choir' opening B minor chord, which,\naccording to rumour, had caused the choir no\ninconsiderable difficulty during rehearsals. But\nj f the choir tp a man (inevitably embracing\nwoman), applied the ancient maxim, 'if in\ndoubt, belt it out', and the reluctant noise, to\nmy untutored ear, bore a very close\nresemblance to the desired effect.\nUnfortunately, this promising start was not\nsustained beyond the first few bars, marred by\na conflict between sections as to the correct\ntempo to take the first fugue and by a sufficient\nnumber of sopranos singing anything above an\nE half a tone flat.\nIn fact, throughout the first half (Kyrie and\nGloria), the sopranos tended to be strained\nand slightly, but markedly, flat and I received\nthe impression that of the 60 or so nominal\nsopranos on stage, only about 20 were making\nan effort to sing above a breathy whisper.\nApart from an isolated tenor entry in the\nsecond Kyrie ele is on, the choir's performance\nthroughout the first half was rather insensitive,\nheavy and wooden, and the dynamics bland,\nalthough this did improve as the performance\nprogressed.\nAs for the soloists, Ann Mackay (soprano)\nwas a disappointing choice, being breathy and\nweak; Ann Mason (mezzo-soprano) and\nMichael George (bass-baritone) were both\nvery pleasant to i is ten to but Andrew King\n(tenor) excelled with superb tone quality and\ngreater musical expression.\nBy the interval, while it would probably be\ntoo harsh to say that all 1 was looking forward\nPortsmouth Point is an overture taking a programme from an early nineteenth century\nprint which apparently portrays the town 'as a place ol considerable rowdiness' and 'drunken\nrevelry'. It one did not know the rh y thi mic complexity ol the parts and the orchestra's sober reputation one might imagine some of\nthem to have taken their interpretation too\nseriously: within the first few bars one of the\npercussionists had split the skin of the bass\ndrum in her enthusiasm (a feat of greater\nimpact than our Editor ever managed).\nHowever the conductor Richard Dickins\nvaliantly kept order making it an exciting\nopening to the concert.\nThe Tchaikovsky fared less well. As a romantic concerto in the grand style it\ndemands panache of the orchestra as well as\nthe soloist and this was not forthcoming.\nAlthough there were only a handful of violins, a much bigger sound was needed. The young\nsoloist Barry Douglas missed this support. His\nplaying was fragmentary whereas a more\ncomplete interpretation would have benefitted\nthe orchestra as well as the audience. This was\nparticularly evident in his unconvincing\nchanges of tempo.\nIn contrast to the first half, the Mahler was\nstunning. From the very start it sounded like a different orchestra. Admittedly, there were a few problems, such as the general un responsiveness to changes of speed and some\noccasionally dod gy intonation. But in general\nthere was greater enthusiasm and much\nlivelier playing. The symphony offers a lot of\nscope for soloist ic wind which was well\nmatched by the execution. There were notable\nperformances by principal trumpet, oboe and\nflute and the extensive horn solos and tutt is more than made up for that section's timid\nstart in the Tchaikovsky.\nIn spite of a rather slow beginning the finale\nof the Mahler was an exuberant climax with all\nplayers at last seeming to shake off any\nremnants of timidity.\nOn the whole the evening, especially the\nMahler, was a credit to the orchestra and its\nconductor who did a remarkable job to\nachieve such a performance from the small\npool of good players available.\nTim Pigden\nto was my free glass of wine and the tenor solo\n(Benedictus qui ven it), the standard thus far\nwas something of a disappointment and\nconsiderably less than one has come to expect\nfrom IC Choir-.\nBut I am happy to say that the choir retrieved\ntheir reputation to some extent during the\nremainder of the performance. Whether it was\nthe wine or the music which inspired them, I know not, but the singing was a great deal\nmore spirited.\nOn the whole entries were confident and\nstrong, apart from a particularly ragged tenor\nentry in the Credo (et in car natus est) and even\nmore ragged and entirely unconvincing alto\nentry (et expect o resurrectionem) which,\ntogether with a flat soprano entry (conf it e or unum baptism a) spoilt the effect achieved by\nthe preceding bass-baritone solo.\nTo my mind the high points of the evening\nwere the Sanctus, which the choir performed\nvery creditably and the Benedictus for tenor\nsolo, accompanied by solo violin (Pamela\nHoward) and continue\nFinally, mention ought to be made of Eric's special orchestra, who gave a consistently\ngood performance and special congratulations\nshould go to the orchestra's IC contingent who\ncompared very favourably with the semiprofessionals surrounding them.\nIsobel Collins\nFELIX is published b v the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the\nlei 0/-5S95111 Ext 1048 or Internal 28S1.

    "content": "IOPINIONI\nThe Union:\nMonolithic? Bureaucratic? Introspective?\nImperial College Union is in a far from healthy state. Too many times\nof late I have heard people saying that the Union is out of touch with\nstudents, that it has no relevance to the average student here. Clearly\nthe Union is lacking in broad appeal and does not fulfill the role as a centre of social activity many people expect from it. Another commonly\nvoiced criticism is that the Union Officers are only doing the jobs for the\nprestige or power or as something to put on their CVs. So why has the\nUnion got the poor image it has in the eyes of so many students?\nPerhaps one of the most\ncommon failings within the\ncircle of people who devote a lot\nof time to the Union is that\nmany of them seem to forget\nthat they are doing the job to\nbenefit students, not just doing\nthe job for its own sake. Students are often referred to as\n'random s', as in 'What was\nthat?' 'Oh nobody, just a random.' However jovially this\nmay be intended it points to a more sinister subconscious\nattitude that the average student\nreally only gets in the way of the\nsmooth running of the Union\nmachinery.\nThe Union has become an end\nin itself, a tower of Babel\nexpanding slowly upwards while\nthe foundations crumble away\nand it has lost sight of any-real\npurpose and lost contact with\nmost of the students.\nRelated to this is the inevitable\nbarrier set up between the\nPresident in his office and the\nstudents. Sat behind his desk it is\neasy to forget that only1 a few\nmonths ago he was himself a 'random'. No matter how\napproachable a president may\nclaim to be he must make an\nunceasing and conscious effort\nto remove these barriers. It is not\nan easy task and requires a great\ndeal of effort and org in ali ty of\nideas, but it is one that must be\naccomplished before the Union\nwill be in a position to give\nstudents the service they want.\nThe task is hampered by the\npresident's time consuming\ncommitment on College com-mitte es. I would be the last\nperson to knock the admirable\ndegree of student representation\nin the administration of College:\nhowever, what good does this do\nif the Union can only campaign\nfor things it assumes students\nwant rather than things it knows\nthey want?\nAnother problem arises from\nthe need for continuity: because\nthe executive changes every year\nthis continuity can be provided\nonly by the permanent staff; in\nparticular Jen Hardy-Smith, by\nall accounts, does an admirable\njob keeping the Union on the\nrails. Inevitably this leads to a continuity that is self-generating\nrather than a situation where the\nUnion takes on a clear direction\nand sets out to achieve certain\ngoals. Changes, at present, are\nminor and administrative in\nnature, and the Union has no\ngeneralised policy. I would\nsuggest that policy may be\ndivided into three levels: first\nlevel which sets out the most\ngeneral aims, namely to represent students and to provide\nthem with such services, amenities and activities as they want\nwhich are within the Union's scope; third level which defines\npolicy on certain highly specific\nareas such as residence, publicity\nmaterial, loans, sexist events and\nso on; second level (which we\nlack) which should both bridge\nthis gap and give the Union a sense of purpose.\nAt the moment the only\ncommon theme running from\none presidency to the next is the\nsmooth function of the existing\nstructure: this I suggest is not\ngood enough, since it implies\nzero progress.\nAs to a solution, I would like\nto see the removal of the clause\nin the constitution which limits a sabbatical to one such year in\nour Union. A president may\nhave a lot of good ideas, but will\nmore than likely be unable to\naccomplish much in just one\nyear. If he is seen to be doing a good job (and at least half of\ndoing a good job is being seen to\ndo so), he ought to be able to\nstand for re-election for a second\nor possibly a third year. It will\nonly be the dedicated and\ncommitted who will want to stay\non: those who are elected\nbecause they wanted something\ngood on their CVs will not spend\na second year on a meagre salary\nwhen they could be earning\nmore elsewhere. The wasters and\nthe ineffectual presidents won't be re-elected.\nThe Union will, in any event,\ncontinue to provide the excellent\nsupport it does at present to the\nclubs and societies. If the\nCollege vote is not cut too\nseverely we will still have one of\nthe widest varieties of clubs and\nsocieties of any union in this\ncountry. However, the Union\ncould, and should, do much\nmore than simply finance\nactivities. It should try to reach\nevery student here in some way:\nit should be an organisation that\nall students relate to as one to\nwhich they belong, as an organisation of students working for\nstudents. It should be a means of\nsolving problems of helping\nstudents make the most of the\nunique opportunity university\nprovides in the broadest sense of\nthe term 'education experience'.\nThe Union ought to provide a focal point for all sorts of\nstudent activity, and to do this it\nmust divest itself of its clique\nimage and make itself totally\naccess able to students.\nThe whole thing is a vicious\ncircle: if we have an Exec that\nlacks character and direction,\nstudents become uninterested,\nthey don't get involved in the\nUnion, and we end up with\nanother choice for the Exec next\nyear. The most depressing thing\nis it's not the result of apathy.\nPeople here do care, and care a lot, but are quickly disillusioned\nby what they find. If the Union is\nto develop this vicious circle\nmust be broken.\nWith our newly elected Exec\nthis change will not be set in\nmotion from the Union Office;\nessentially they stand for maintaining the status quo. So if\nanything is to be done it must be\ninitiated by the grassroots. If\nanyone reading this article\nagrees with some or all of the\npoints raised I would ask of you\ntwo things: first fill in the form\nbelow saying what you think the\nUnion should be doing for\nstudents that it is not already\ndoing. Second, if you think you\ncould be the person to get to the\ntop and set in motion the long\noverdue overhaul, then get a place on a Union committee, get\nthe inside information and then\nstand for president in a year's time. At the end of the day, if\nyou want change and think you\ncan bring it about, it's up to you\nto set it rolling.\nSimon Rodan\nEAO\nt To the President, IC Union\nIn my opinion, the students union is not fulfilling its\npurpose as a student organisation because\nNeither is it relevant to me as a student here\nbecause\nI would like to see the following changes\nI think the students union is doing a good job and\nthink the criticisms expressed in this article are\ngroundless.\nFELIX March 23, 1983 Page 9\n\n"
