The emergency lighting\nautomatically came on in corridors\nand staircases. At 10.00am on Monday\n16th EDF reinstated the power to the\nbuildings.\u201d\nMany students were oblivious about\nthe whole incident as they were asleep,\nwith the majority realising the lack of\npower and water in the morning. One\nof the residents in Southwell Halls told\nfelix that \u201cI was very confused when I\ngot up in the morning and tried to turn\nthe light on. I then went to the kitchen\nto get a drink of water where there was\na sign on the door saying that everything wasn\u2019t working.\u201d\nIn order to repair the damage that\nthe incident caused, EDF had to disconnect power to Southwell and Holbein Halls from 13:00 on Monday, but\npower was finally reinstated to all affected areas by 22:00.\nThe Estates department, realising\nthat these premises might have been\nwithout any power, came up with a\nback-up solution. \u201cIn the early evening\nEstates provided a generator as back\nup in case EDF could not reinstate the\npower on Monday evening.\u201d said Mr\nNotley.\nHe then went on to say that: \u201cDuring this time students affected were directed to Common Rooms within the\nhalls that had power. When students\nreturned from College between 17:00\nand 18:00 the Wardens briefed them\non the situation. Students were given\nfood vouchers which they could use in\nthe library.

Initially the\nresults were meant to be announced\non Thursday night, but Returning Officer Christian Carter decided to move\nthe date forward after all candidates\nagreed to have it earlier.\nMr Carter decided to released the results in reverse order, according to the\nnumber of votes casted. Starting with\nthe Student Trustees, Mark MearingSmith was elected in the first round.\nMr Mearing-Smith is joined by Esther Khan who won in the 5th round,\nAmaury Fastenakel who won in the 3rd\nround and Shah Rahman who won in\nthe 6th round.\nNext up were the results for Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) where John James\nproved that second time\u2019s a charm, as\nhe beat Caroline Clark by 312 votes\nand Michael Powell who came in third\nwith 501 votes. Clearly Mr James\u2019 energetic speeches worked where he\npromised to fight the increase in accommodation costs next year. A total\nof 1,957 people voted, only 188 more\nthan last year.\nNext up was the other newly formed\nposition of Deputy President (Educa-tion) where Jonathan Silver came out\nvictorious in the second round against\nAlex Grisman with Matthew Kaufeler\nfalling in the first round along with\nRON. A massive 2,046 people voted,\nwhich was 277 more than the year before where it was a combined position\nfor education and welfare.\nThe Knit-Soc queen and Social Clubs\nCommittee chair, Jennifer Wilson,\nwas named the new Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) after she managed\nto stave-off the Athletics Club Committee candidate Colette Gregory, winning in the first round by 1,214 votes\nto 846.\nCurrently there are several GlaxoSmithKline employees in an internal\ncourse that teaches them the fundamentals of lab chemistry. This course\nhas been running for years and is based\naround teaching employees from non-lab-specific backgrounds how to work\nin a chemistry pharmaceutical compa-ny. For the most part these employees\nhave doctorates and multiple degrees\nand are on what is essentially a chemistry conversion course run by GSK.\nThis course has been run routinely all\nover the world, in a standardized form\nand has proved to be quite successful\nfor GSK, who decided to try and turn it\ninto a more substantial qualification.\nGSK, via the Royal Society of Chemistry, then asked Imperial College to\naccredit the course by acting as an external examiner and then putting the\nImperial College brand on the course.\nBut as the Chemistry department examined the content of the course they\ncame to the opinion that what GSK\nwere teaching their staff was extremely\nclose to being a masters degree and decided that after some minor changes\nthey could issue the GSK employees\nwith Imperial College masters\u2019 diplomas \u2013 in return for cash.\nOn Wednesday 17th Professor Tom\nWelton presented an application to the\nGraduate School of Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Quality Committee to create a new programme called\n\u201cProfessional Development (GSK\nPharmaceutical Process Chemistry)\u201d\nwhich would essentially make Imperial\nCollege act as a moderating body for\nthe internal GSK programme, provided\nthe course met certain conditions. The\nintention of this paper, as explained by\nthe head of the chemistry department,\nwas to pave the way for the creation of\na new programme whereby GSK employees would be able to earn an Imperial College Masters degree for a course\nthat would be taught, designed and\nexamined by GSK but modified and\nmoderated by the College to ensure\nquality standards are met. Should this\nprogramme prove successful, the next\nstep would be to sell the new masters\npackage to other pharmaceutical com-panies, specifically Merck and Proctor\nand Gamble.\nIf the College decides to go ahead\nand allow the new masters course to be\nmade, it would be the first university\nto have sold a course and degree, as a\nproduct, to a company.\nAfter the talks on Wednesday the\ncommittee is currently drawing up\nconditions that the GSK course and\nemployees must meet for Imperial to\naccredit and moderate the internal\ncourse; in principle the committee is\nhappy to proceed provided that the\npeople who take the course have 2.1\ndegrees (most, in fact, have significantly better qualifications), that they\nare taught to Imperial standard (by\nGSK staff), that the course is of a high\nenough quality (determined by the\nChemistry Department and externally\nmoderated) and that the participants\nare examined properly (the specifics\nhave yet to be confirmed).\nWhen the student representative\nraised points about ensuring that the\nvalue of students\u2019 degrees were not\nharmed by the sale of degrees to private interests the committee agreed\nthat this could be the beginning of a\nslippery slope and that the participating firms would have to be carefully\nselected. As one committee member put it \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t do this with\nWoolworths\u201d\nFor students, this could prove to be\neither good or bad news. If Imperial\nwere to start outsourcing its degree\nteaching it could forge an extremely\nstrong strategic position within the\nprivate sector as an industry standard,\nbut if mismanaged it could massively\ndevalue degrees, only time can tell.\nBut this reporter would like to recommend that if, years from now, we need\nto pick a definitive date that Imperial\nstarted \u201cselling out\u201d it should be the\n17th March 2009.\nIn the race for Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services) the Royal School of\nMines boy Danny Hill was up against\nRecreational Clubs Committee chair\nPeter Mabbott. At the final count,\nDanny Hill had 1,148 votes compared\nto Peter Mabbott\u2019s 850, meaning that\nDanny Hill will be taking control of the\nUnion\u2019s budget next year.\nSurprisingly, the position of Union\nPresident didn\u2019t attract the highest\nvoting attendance, which has normally\nbeen the case in the past. This could\nbe due to the fact that there was only\none candidate running for the position,\nhowever, the RON candidate managed\nto put up a good fight. In the end, Ashley Brown was named the new Imperial College union President, winning\nthe race with a 1,572 votes compared\nto 763 votes for RON.\nIn a rather surprising turn, it was indeed the position for Felix Editor that\nattracted the highest turn-out at 2,646\nvotes, which roughly equates to 25% of\nthe electoral body at Imperial. In the\nfirst round, Zo\u00eb Dobell and RON were\neliminated leaving this year\u2019s Deputy\nEditor and News Editor to fight it out\nto the bitter end. As has been the pattern over the past few years, the position for Felix Editor was a fiercely\nfought one, with only 65 votes in it.\nThis very slim victory margin ended\nup favouring Dan Wan, who will be the\nnew editor as Felix enters its 60th year.\nThe close margin for Felix Editor has\nbeen a familiar sight in recent years,\nwith this year\u2019s editor, Jovan Nedi\u0107,\nwinning by only 78 votes against Greg\nMead last year. Tom Roberts, who was\nrecently named Guardian Media Student Journalist of the Year, only won\nhis election against Emily Lines by 49\nvotes back in 2007.\nThis record-breaking turnout for\nSabbatical elections shows how seriously the candidates have been taking\nthe elections, which can only be a positive outcome for student democracy.\nfelix would like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone that won\nand wishes them the best of luck. Trust\nme, you\u2019re going to need it.\nReturning Officer, Christian Carter, announcing the results\nThe pavement just outside Holbein Hall where the incident occured\nphoto\ncourtecy\nof\nlawrence\nweetman\nand\nlive.cgcu.net\n\n"

For those of you who don\u2019t\nknow, The Immortals are Imperial\nCollege\u2019s very own American Football\nTeam. The Club was founded in October 2008 and since then we have grown\nfrom a small group of enthusiasts to a\nunit of 30 chiselled athletes.\nLife for the club started out with\nkit less sessions in the mud across\nthe road in Hyde Park. After negotiations between our Head Coach Matt\nExcell and Coach Franco of the London Cobras (a top professional team\nin England) we have been having full\ncontact workouts twice a week over at\ntheir Selhurst training facility, with additional white board classes to discuss\ntactics, and time in the weights room\nto further enhance our physique.\nTo be eligible to play in the BUAF\nLeague we have to host one home\nfixture. This will be taking place this\ncoming Sunday against the London\nCobras down at Harlington (KO 1pm).\nWe hope that you can come down and\nsupport the mighty Imperial Immortals. Cheerleaders are required! If you\ncannot make it but are keen on getting\ninvolved over the summer and next\nyear please send an email to american.\nfootball@imperial.ac.uk\nFinally a big thank you has to go out\nto Mac, Jan and Coach Excell for getting the ball rolling and also for the\ntime and effort put in over the year\nfrom Stan, Tom and Rich.\nGeorge Barnes\nImperial overcome Oxford\nand dances itself to 2nd place\nCambridge comes first, Oxford second\nand Imperial... third \u2013 that\u2019s how the\ncore of the current Imperial College\nDance Team grew up in the university\ndance circuit. After 10 years of not getting past the 3rd place \u2013 it was finally\ntime for change!\nOn the last weekend of February,\n62 dancers, 2 captains and 4 coaches\nmade their way to Blackpool to compete at the annual Inter-Varsity Dance\nCompetition held in the Empress Ballroom \u2013 probably the most famous\nballroom dance venue in the world and\nhost to several of the most prestigious\ncompetitions.\nAlready in the individual events\nthe Imperial team demonstrated its\nstrength. Many couples danced their\nway into the finals with impressive\nresults \u2013 especially considering there\nwere about 500 couples dancing in to-tal.

In the Advanced\nevent, Arman Sahovic & Nicole Papaioannou came 5th.\nThe open events were followed by\nan incredible demonstration by Craig\nShaw & Natasha Manderson (who\ncoaches the IC Ballroom team). Their\nstunning, creative and moving show\nwas very well received by the audience\nand followed by a standing ovation.\nThe next highlight of the day, how-ever, was the team event. Each university is allowed four teams A, B, C,\nD. All our teams made it into the first\ndivision, with only our A team making\nit to the final. The results for each team\nwere: A came 4th, B came 3rd, C and\nD both came 2nd (beating Oxford) \u2013\nwhich added up to a very unexpected\noverall 2nd place!!\nAfter a long and exhausting day, suddenly everyone found renewed energy\nto party all night long to celebrate this\nresult.

The crew\nwere stung by a swarm of crews with\nhigher standards than previous years,\nbut more critically had to cope with a\ncox-box failure upon spinning at the\nstart line. Although the race plan had\nbeen well studied beforehand this may\nhave cost the crew precious seconds\nand the coveted honour of club blazers.\nThe result was undeserved for the crew\nwho have worked tirelessly in preparation for this race.\nImperial College A (Ellie Dorman,\nRachael Davies, Nicky Smith, Erica\nThompson, Selina Graham, Ro Smith,\nLouise Hart, Chloe Symmonds) finished 22nd overall in 19:56.33 (11th/34\nin S2) to overall winners London/Hollandia/Thames/Marlow/UL (18:28.27).\nFurther salt to the wound was the 9th\nposition placing of Osiris BC A whom\nthe IC crew repeatedly rowed through\nat training a few weeks earlier. Cox Tom\nFieldman, younger brother of top-international-world-renowned-elite-cr\u00e8mede-la-cr\u00e8me-de-la-coxswain Henry\nFieldman (and modest too) was at the\nhelm of the crew. Fieldman Junior was\ninstrumental in the crews\u2019 improvement in the final weeks of preparation\nand is highly rated by coaches and crew\nat Imperial. It has never been explicitly\nsaid that Tom is better at coxing than\nHenry,buttheeldersiblingwasshocked\nat the mere suggestion. \u201cF*ck my life!\nMan, you actually rate Tom higher than\nme, are you kidding?! What does he\nhave that I don\u2019t?\u201d There was little hesitation before the response: \u201cCharm.\u201d\nEx-ex-UL-cox Henry was undoubtedly\nfeeling guilty having coxed the women\u2019s\nUL8+ in direct competition against the\nIC crew, with UL placing 18th. \u201cWho is\ncoxing you at Heineken?\u201d \u201cYou could.\u201d\n\u201cEh, well, eh, I\u2019ll probably have to cox\nthe men\u2019s crew\u2026 but I can cox you for\na Henley race.\u201d The women\u2019s squad\ngratefully accept these crumbs from\nthe master\u2019s table.\nImperial College B (Christina Matteotti, Alice Smitheman, Stef Menashe, Clarice Chung, Georgie Philips,\nChristina Duffy, Hannah Rouse, Cynthia Mynhardt) were coxed by Nicola\nQuinn-Pyatt and placed 97th overall,\n29th/69 in S3. There was little expectation for the crew composed of a bow\npair who was taken out of rowing re-tirement, a post stress-fractured three\nseat and a novice at four. Officer Duffy\nwas not impressed at being hurried\nthrough her pre-race stretching re-gime; \u201cUnless you want my shins to explode mid-race - you\u2019ll let me stretch\u201d.\nWith enough yield in their calves to go\nthe distance and back they rowed their\nlittle hearts out and secured the top\n100 placing they have been aiming for\nall year, ahem. An epic overtaking of\nRUMS was the highlight which started\nat Barnes Bridge and wasn\u2019t completed until a few lengths before Putney\nBridge. But it was done and that\u2019s all\nthat matters.\nImperial College C (Julia Hong, Tamsin Bromley-May, Ranalie Karunartne,\nEllie Berry, Carla Canturri, Ella Burroughes, Rose Stainthorp, Natasha Ganecki) were coxed by Libby Richards\nand came 226th overall 20th/45 in the\nNovice Academic category. This is a\n100 place drop from last year\u2019s novice\ncrew who came 126th overall (4th/48\nin Novice Academic). IC C managed to\nbeach themselves on the way up to the\nstart rendering the steering control un-predictable. The crew pin-balled their\nway down the course and were lucky to\nescape with just a single time penalty\nfor impeding other competitors.\nWhen racing was complete all crews\nretired to the Jolly Gardeners to ponder their fate. Inebriated chat reached\nan all-time low after the disappointing\nresults were released. Locals later complained of rowdy IC students discussing\nshapes; \u201cIf I was a shape, I would so be\nan ellipse.\u201d \u201cNo-no it\u2019s all about the cir-cle, an ellipse is just a posh circle. You\nwant to get down with the common\nshapes.\u201d The party ended at London RC\nwith more shapes thrown around the\ndance-floor.\nDespite being driftwood; hollow and\nof no use, there were no reports of waterfalls finding, binding or grinding\nany of the three crews. The pre-race\nserenade led by Will Todd, Tom Bell\nand Adam Seward resonated in crews\u2019\nminds as they paddled away from the\nICBC bat-cave; \u201cDon\u2019t stop believing/\nHold on to that feeling.\u201d Because we\nall believe in IC. The disappointment\nof IC A comes with the consolation\nof avoiding a major fashion faux-pas;\nLondon fashion week have literally just\nannounced that blazers are last season.\nThey don\u2019t accentuate the female form\nlike an all-in-one can.\nThe crew should be proud of how far\nthey have come in preparation for this\nrace and carry these achievements forward to next weekend in Amsterdam\nwhere the Heineken Roeivierkamp\ntakes place on the Amstel River.\nChristina Duffy reports on the Women\u2019s Head of the River\n2009 as well as fashion faux-pas and famous cox\u2019s\n\u201cUnless you\nwant my shins\nto explode mid-race, you\u2019ll let\nme stretch!\u201d\nN\nTeam What What have taken over the\ncryptic crossword mantle, and have yet\nagain won the cryptic yet again. I\u2019m not\nsure what\u2019s happened to the rest of you\nguys, are they too difficult?\nAnyway, here is another one by Sam\nWong for you all to have a go at.

And this\ntime I travelled back with my brother\u2019s\nfiance\u00e9, who is white and Welsh \u2013 you\ncould say this was a typical fish-out-of-water scenario.\nLet me explain why this is a big deal.\nI used to think: if you are thinking of\ngoing to Nigeria but don\u2019t happen to be\nNigerian, unless you are adventurous\nand have someone who will whisk you\naway the second you hit the tarmac at\nthe other end, don\u2019t bother! Nowadays\nthe requirements are different. You\ndon\u2019t actually have to be Nigerian.\nNigeria is just not ready for tourists,\nand backpackers are just asking for the\ntrouble.\nWith this in mind, I took it upon myself to be a tourist guide of a country\nthat has yet to discover what the word\n\u2018tourism\u2019 means. In the words of my\nsoon-to-be sister-in-law, \u201cI went to\nBorders to find a Lonely Planet guide\nabout Nigeria, and there was nothing\u2026\nthere was one for West Africa with a\nparagraph on Nigeria, which basically\nsays \u2018don\u2019t go there\u2019.\u201d\nSo the following is, in part, my prospective entry for the Lonely Planet\nGuide to Nigeria.\nThe first sight you get to see when\ngoing to Nigeria actually takes place\nbefore you even depart \u2013 the airport.\nFor those who walk in and think, \u201cI\u2019ve\nflown before, I know what happens\nat the airport, why should this be any\ndifferent?\u201d, expect to be struck the\nfrustration of standing in the check-in\nqueue for many hours. Once checked\nin, frustration does turn into amusement when watching Nigerian women\n(and their husbands/bellboys), who\nhave already gone to the counter and\nhave been informed that the baggage\nallowances are \u20182 bags, 23kg each\u2019 not\n\u20183 of 32kg each\u2019, furiously repacking\ntheir bags by the queue in hope that\nit will make them 10kg lighter. As for\nthe extra suitcase, it is handed to the\nnext person they know who is boarding a plane to Nigeria with express\ninstructions.\nAnother staple of the check-in queue\nis the last-minute mobile-phone guy.\nThis particular stereotype usually\ncomes across as having \u00a35 credit remaining on his T-mobile (it is the Nigerian network) sim card and, leaving\nEngland for good or just for a month,\nfinds it outrageous to let \u201cthe British\nGovernment take his money\u201d. To use\nup his credit, everybody in the phone-book gets a call, and the pidgin English starts (translation in parentheses)\n\u201cOl\u2019 boy, wetin dey happen?\u201d (-\u201cHey,\nhow\u2019s it going?\u201d), \u201cHow body?\u201d (-\u201cYou\ngood?\u201d), \u201cI jus dey oh\u201d (-\u201cI\u2019m chilling\u201d),\n\u201cI dey for airport, dis queue neva finish\u201d (-\u201cI\u2019m at the airport, standing in\na long queue\u201d). \u201cWait, wait, wait\u2026\nwhen you go next go home?\u201d (-\u201cHang\non, you\u2019re going back to Nigeria soon\naren\u2019t you?\u201d), \u201cHow many suitcase you\nfit carry?\u201d And so on.\nThe flight itself is pretty uneventful,\nalthough you are always guaranteed\nthat at least 10% of the passengers\nwill be under the age of one (we had\nto become the most populous African\ncountry somehow). Which might be a\nproblem if you were planning to sleep\nmy ward some unruly behaviour on the\nflight, everyone stayed in their seats\n(talk about progress).\nWhen you eventually step off the\nplane into the welcoming/suffocating\narms of the heat, you are faced with\nfinal obstacle to entry to the hallowed\ncountry \u2013 the infamous border control.\n\u201cBest to steel yourself,\u201d I thought, \u201cto\nhear the words, \u2018Ah, oga sa, wetin you\nbring for us now?\u2019 (-\u2018Hello, sir, what\ndid you bring for us?\u2019)\u201d . But no such\nadvance was forthcoming, at least not\nuntil baggage collection, when I could\nsmile and say \u201cAh, it\u2019s not like that\u201d and\nwalk off.\nAs you leave the airport, you are\ngreeted by what is seemingly the biggest tourist attraction that Lagos has\nto offer. Just like the Table Mountain\nin Cape Town, everyone who comes to\nLagos leaves having spent a fair chunk\nof time looking at it, and talking about\nit. Oh yes, the Traffic (not traffic, but\nTraffic).\nTraffic jams are ingrained into the\npsyche and life of the Lagosian, should\nyou be in it or making a living out of it.\nDuring our two-hour drive across the\ncity (50 km?) we spotted CDs, DVDs,\ndrinks, food, TV aerials, fans, radios\nand \u2013 I have seen at one point \u2013 puppies being sold in the traffic by car-to-car vendors. When it seemed to have\nsettled an estate car \u2013 originally meant\nfor people \u2013 went past us, packed full\nof plantains; there was about enough\nspace for the driver and a passenger,\nand you wouldn\u2019t have been able to fit\nanything else in the car, no matter how\nsmall the item is.\nAnd when the traffic does clear, you\nrealise that this is a place that probably\nhas never heard of the High-way Code\n(or blatantly ignores it). The use of the\ncar horn becomes a central and essential driving skill and, in many cases, replacing the job that the rear view mirror of other drivers should be doing.\nWe got to experience the full frenzy\nof the local driving twice in the space\nof the week, with two accidents in the\nsame car. Both times the driver of our\ncar was not at fault; both times the\ndriver who crashed into us jumped\nout of their car and started shouting\n\u201cKi lo de (What\u2019s up)? Are you blind?\nWhy are you driving like that?\u201d On the\nsecond occasion, the other driver, with\na clear road ahead of him suddenly\nchanged lane and blind-sided us. It resulted in a physical fight at the side of\nthe road.\nAfter about 20 minutes of yelling,\nduring which time a crowd of bystanders who had nothing to do with the accident had gathered and commentated\non who was at fault, the other driver\nsimply admitted their guilt and paid\nfor the damage on the spot, since insurance is an iffy thing in Nigeria.\nSo the question, I hear, is with all this\nmadness, why bother with Nigeria?\nIt sounds like a hideously unpleasant\ncountry to visit.\nBut then, the best thing about Lagos\nis the people and, beyond all the crazi-ness, they provide the best moments.\nAs preparations for my dad\u2019s 60th\nbirthday were underway, people kept\npopping up to help out with one thing\nor another, so we got to reconnect with\npeople we hadn\u2019t seen for years \u2013 I was\nreminded just why the New Scientist\nhas named Nigerians the happiest people in the world.\nNigerians seem to have a way of enjoying life whatever the situation is and\nregardless of how beleaguered they are,\nand are born with a delightful ability to\nlaugh at themselves. And we do love a\ngood party.\nAnd speaking of parties, for his birthday my dad went to the market and\nhaggled for a live ram for the occasion.\nThis ram was then brought home and\nkept away from our dogs, which would\nprobably have ripped it to shreds.\n(A brief word on dogs: in England\nthe average dog is called something\nlike Fido, Rover or Lassie. Cute dogs\nhave no place in Lagos. You would find\nnames like Killer, Hitler & Satan; the\ndog has to be mean, hulking and preferably of German origin. Its primary\npurpose is not to look adorable or keep\nyou company, but to bite anyone in\nyour compound it doesn\u2019t recognise.\nOur two rottweilers are called, mis-leadingly enough, Casper and Daisy \u2013\nthey would eat that ram alive.)\nOn the day of the party, some guy\n(who I shall refer to as \u2018Ram Man\u2019)\nshows up with a couple of sharp knives\nand a half-barrel barbecue and transformed that smelly animal roped up in\nour yard (RSPCA would never fly in\nNigeria) into succulent bits of barbecued goodness called Suya, otherwise\nknown as the reason why you don\u2019t really find Nigerian vegetarians.\nThen the band showed up, asked my\nbrother for the names of family members and proceeded to insert praises for\neach family member into all the songs\nthey sing, and by doing so, usher in\nanother very Nigerian custom \u2013 spray-ing. This is where you dance and those\nolder than you attach currency notes to\nyour forehead: the more you do so, the\nmore the band praises you and when\nyou spray them, they shut up.\nMy brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e got in on the\nact, getting praises by the band, spraying them and having a bevy of aunties\nadopt her as their own child and lead\nher through the potentially scary world\nof Nigerian families. The way they took\nsomeone in and treated her as one of\ntheir own reminded me that regardless of all the nonsense we are known\nfor around the world \u2013 the lack of or-ganisation, the fraudulent emails you\nreceive asking for your bank details,\nextreme tardiness \u2013 Nigeria has some\nreally good things to offer.\nWith a revolving door of relatives,\nfriends, former teachers and ex-col\u201cThat\u2019s Lagos for\nyou\u201d, explained\na friend involved\nin the fight, \u201cyou\nhave to attack\nfirst before the\ncrazy person\nattacks you\u201d\n\u201cI was reminded\njust why the\nNew Scientist\nhas named\nNigerians the\nhappiest people\nin the world\u2026we\nseem to have a\nway of enjoying\nlife whatever the\nsituation is\u201d\nleagues, it was a great six hours of fun,\nand one of those places and times that\nmakes everything else seem worth-while. The traffic, the crazies who crash\ninto you, the airport queue \u2013 they matter no more. You get together with the\npeople, eat the meat, dance the dance,\nfeel the love and you get a slice of Nigerian goodness. My prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, who had a\ntaste of it all, left Lagos wanting to go\nback. Lagos possesses a kind of crazy\nmagic: it has everything to make you\nmake you hate it, but somehow leaves\nyou thinking \u2018that was fun\u2019.\nHowever, I believe Lagos is chang-ing: the recently-elected Governor of\nLagos has shown that he cares about\nthe state (a novelty in recent Nigerian\nhistory), and is committed in cleaning\nup the streets, building better, bigger\nroads and introduce some order to\nproceedings. So within a few years, my\naccounts might not be the picture the\naverage visitor is greeted with \u2013 I need\nto publish these before they stop being\ntrue.\n\u201cI want to go to Lagos before it gets\ntamed,\u201d said a friend of mine. I can understand the sentiment.\nSo for those of you who have a Lagosian friend, make them take you to\nNigeria with them before it does get\ntamed. One thing Lagos can guarantee\nis a lot of crazy stories to tell and, really,\nhow is life complete without them?\nA crafts vendor\nUmm...Suya...Veggies, beware\nTeenage vendors selling goods by an immobile traffic\nA Lagosian market, catering for your Nigerian needs\nThe notorious Traffic\nT\nhis would have been my\nconfession: I am running\nout of material. So exactly\nwhat did this mean? Well,\nI was afraid I was going to\nhave to pack in the travel section, after\njust three weeks of service to felix.\nReally? I hear you ask. Of course not\n\u2013 no shit, Sherlock.\nSo, in order to seek inspiration (keep\nmyjob),Idelvedintothemysticalworld\nthat is the felix archives. In that dodgy\nbackroom of the basement, I excavated\nthe volumes of past issues that bore the\nnames of my predecessors. Now I can\ndraw upon their wisdom and salvage\nmy many unfinished manuscripts of\nhorrid writing.\nThat\u2019s when it struck me hard.\nThe eagerness to learn soured into\njealousy. I mean, how can one travel\nwriter write so well? It was certainly no\nPaul Theorux but, hey, this is a student\nnewspaper after all. If this isn\u2019t discouraging enough, I found articles on every\nsingle place I have been to, or would\nwant to visit. The series of memoirs\nwritten by Ammar Waraich, 4th year\nmedic (2007-08) and travel editor of\nfour months, essentially had the whole\nof Africa covered.\nTruth to be told, I may as well as pack\nmy bag and go home. Put my scripts\nin a box and burn it will you? In fact,\nI shall call it my funeral pyre and toss\nmyself into the flames whilst I still have\na shred of dignity left.\nMy revelation came in the form of\nAlex Marsden\u2019s article from last week\u2019s\nissue of felix. Literature and travel, I\nmust admit, is indeed a divine mar-during the six-hour flight time. Also,\neven though it has become a more\nregular occurrence in the last couple\nof years, the sight of a pale face on one\nof these flights still brings a few double\ntakes from those sat close by, the unspoken question traditionally being: \u201cI\nhave to go back, Junior needs to meet\nhis grandparents\u2026but what are you\nlooking for in Nigeria?\u201d\nI had once imagined that being an\nair hostess on a flight to Lagos was a\njob for the person who had drawn the\nshort straw, or one who had really pissed Sir Richard Branson off. Why? Let\u2019s\njust say that \u2018order\u2019 is another word\nthat Nigerians are still grasping the\nmeaning of. I remember one occasion\nwhere the pilot had to halt the plane on\nthe runway and refused to move until\neveryone had sat down, as almost the\nentire plane had shot out of their seats\nthe second the plane touched down,\nwith the \u2018fasten your seat belts\u2019 sign\nstill on. To serve a Lagosian mob? Talk\nabout career suicides.\nThis time round, I had a weird mix of\nglowing pride and simmering annoyance because, although I had promised\nriage \u2013 there is no doubt that the two\ncombine to emanate the essence of\ntrue adventure. One\u2019s anticipation\nfor adventure, most certainly \u201centicing\u201d, can only be magnified through\ntravel literature, while the thirst itself\nis quenched by the actual experience.\nIt is how you get the constant doses of\nadrenaline before, during, and after the\ntrip.\nBut now I am musing on a reversed\ndebate: while we have established that\ntravel literature and its reader do share\nan intimate relationship, what is the\nstance of literature with its authors?\nHow on Earth could travel writers\ncope with composing literature about\nlocalities that have been depicted, often repetitively, by hundreds in the\npast?\nAnd that is when I understood what\ntravel writing is about \u2013 personal experience and discovery. OK, I won\u2019t\ngo on about the effects of travelling on\npersonality development (I definitely\ndidn\u2019t \u2018find\u2019 anything travelling) but\nthere is no denial that every visit to the\nsame place is unique itself as, even if\nthe place hardly changes, your encounters and interaction with people would\nbe different. This can\u2019t be better demonstrated than by Tosin Ajayi, who has\nkindly written this week\u2019s article about\nNigeria. Don\u2019t expect to be bombarded\nwith facts \u2013 just enjoy the many hidden\ngems he is willing to spill in order to\ngrab your attention.\nI guess I shouldn\u2019t be so discouraged\n\u2013 I shall remain, after a promising Easter break, at your readership\u2019s humbled\nservice. In the meantime \u2013 chocolate.\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n16 felix Friday 20 March 2008\nThe Rival 1\nlacrosse\nRival\nIssue 1 - 2009\nThe\nG\nalileo proved that the\nearth revolves around\nthe sun. He was called a\nheretic by the Catholic\nChurch despite his unwavering faith and spent much of his\nlater life under house arrest. He had\na daughter out of wedlock called Virginia. He did move to Florence and\nhe did go blind.\nThe story that Brecht weaves\naround these facts in The Life of\nGalileo is wonderful. It gives Galileo,\nVirginia and even the Pope complex\nand believable characters. Watching\ntheir story unfold made for a very\nenjoyable evening.\nIt employs the playwright\u2019s famous\nalienation effect: making the audience stand back and analyse the implications of Galileo\u2019s scientific discovery for society and for religion.\nThis is Brecht at his best, using great\ncharacters to make a wider social\ncommentary.\nDramSoc chose well. And not just\nbecause Brecht is an accomplished\nwriter. The social and political issues\nhighlighted by the play are echoed\nin those faced by science, and sometimes science students, today. Galileo\u2019s murmurings about how much\nmore science he could do if he didn\u2019t\nhave to teach are uncomfortably\nreminiscent of the complaints often\noverheard in the SCR.\nHe performs a careful balancing\nact between investigative, pure science and providing useful tools like\nthe telescope to keep his sponsors\nhappy. And it only takes a little imagination to remodel the sponsors\nas the funding bodies which provide\nthe financial lifeblood to science to-day; the struggle to explain the economic benefits of theoretical physics\nor biological modelling is the bane of\nmany a PhD proposal.\nThe opening performance in the\nUnion Concert Hall was disciplined\nand energetic. The cast worked well\nas an ensemble, never tiring or losing focus. But it was Gilead Amit\u2019s\nskillful portrayal of Galileo that\nheld the production together. Playing a lead with so much stagetime\nand personality is a challenge he\nmet with aplomb. Aaron Singh\u2019s interpretation of Sagredo & the Little\nMonk was thoughtful and engaging.\nThe dialogue between these two actors exhibited an impressive level of\ndramatic sophistication.\nAdam Khamis was convincingly\nevil as the Cardinal Inquisitor, commanding the stage on every appear-ance. Shamini Bundell and Ziggi\nSzafranski were equally arresting as\nGalileo\u2019s daughter and the pope re-spectively: giving energetic performances throughout.\nThe set for this production was\nambitious and perhaps, like many\nstudent productions, could have\nbenefitted from a \u2018less is more\u2019 phi-losophy. The sometimes excruciatingly long scene changes interrupted\nthe play\u2019s narrative for too long. But\nthe intelligent design did work well\nto orientate the audience as the play\nmoves between Rome and Venice, as\nwell as providing a pleasing frame\nfor the more static scenes. The period costumes were wonderful and\nuseful for distinguishing the several\ncharacters played by several of the\nactors.\nThe Life of Galileo discusses the\npolitics of science. And as students\nof science it makes for welcome food\nfor thought. Despite the disruptions,\nDramSoc do a great job of bringing it to the Imperial student stage.\nSomething that Brecht \u2013 who saw\nthe stage as a social forum \u2013 would\nhave no doubt approved of.\nCONTACT: OBI on05@ic.ac.uk / 07852989687 OR LIZ eo05@ic.ac.uk\nThe Drewe Theatre\nReynolds Building,\nImperial Medical Campus,\nSt. Dunstans Road,\nHammersmith, London,\nW6 8RP\nNearest Tube Station: Barons Court or Hammersmith\n(Piccadilly & District Lines)\nIn aid of \u2018RAINBOW TRUST CHILDREN\u2019S CHARITY\u2019...providing practical and emotional support to families with terminally ill children.

Horror movies have\ndefinitely undergone a bit of plastic\nsurgery, and it\u2019s the manner in which\nthis has shaped horror productions\nwhich causes my dismay. The fact of\nthe matter is that with the immense\nvisual power of the 21st century, many\nfilmmakers have thought that inducing\nunease through violent images and\nbrutal editing, amounts to a fair work\nof horror. While such a belief holds\nsome truth in itself, this empowerment\nhas lead to abuse: once you focus\non the imagery and not the content,\nthe only way to become original and\ninnovative(i.e.interesting)isbystriving\nto new extremes of the disgusting.\nHowever, this isn\u2019t necessarily bad. A\nfilm may be of debatable taste, but still\nterrifying. What has killed the modern\nhorror movie is the baseness of the\nstories it tells, the innate stupidity of its\ncharacters, the incredibly predictable\nplots and plot twists and, even worse,\nthe fact that some of these elements\nare portrayed in such a manner that\nthey should impress the viewer. I won\u2019t\neven mention remakes more than once\nin this article, although they\u2019re a crying\nshame and deserve a dissertation sized\nspanking. What saddens me is that\nwhile production values have gone\nup and can finally inspire the fear one\nlusts for when happiness wants to\nkick one out of his/her house, there\nseems to be no horror movie left worth\nseeing for the lingering effect of \u201cI\u2019m\nnot opening the fridge, you do it\u201d.\nSome of the more gifted filmmakers\nhave realized that the direction horror\nmovies have taken is almost insulting\nand they\u2019ve chosen to embrace their\ncheesiness and B-movie nature by\nturningthemintoparodies,oratleastby\ntryingtoblendinsomeself-deprecating\nparody amongst the horror. This isn\u2019t a\nbad move \u2013 or at least it wasn\u2019t until\neveryone started taking horror with a\npinch of clownishness. Given that this\nhas had a wide effect on American and\nBritish films in particular, almost all\nsatisfactory horror movies of late have\nbeen in a language other than English.\nThe current state of affairs is so\ndepressing that I don\u2019t even go to see\nhorror movies any more. As soon as\nthe trailer\u2019s finished, it\u2019s clear what The\nUnborn, The Uninvited, The Haunting\nand all their relatives will be like. And\nwhen a month ago I made the mistake\nof watching My Bloody Valentine 3D,\nall I got was a mindless borefest, a\nridiculous pile of \u201clet\u2019s play around\nwith this technology so as to scare\nsome people out of their money\u201d. I\nmean really, as has been argued many\ntimes before, there is a difference\nbetween scaring someone and startling\nsomeone. That\u2019s how bad it\u2019s gotten.\nI don\u2019t particularly mind when you\ncan enjoy a film without putting your\nbrain to any use, but when having\na brain proves an impediment to\nenjoying a film, well, then I have\na problem. The truth is that not\neverything has to change, and this can\nbe seen by contemplating the irony\nthat a revolution has already taken\nplace in modern horror, but we\u2019re no\nbetter off than we were before it. I\ncan understand that it will take more\nthan a Judd Apatow figure to put\nout a great work of horror, because\npatterns work way better in comedies\nthan they do in horror movies. But\nit\u2019s not fair that the marketplace\ndictates what kind of horror is being\nOne of, if not the, most famous\nshower scene ever (from Psycho)\nThe cute face hugging thingy was the icing on the cake in Alien.\nDon\u2019t know what to watch over the\nforthcoming break? Well even I was\nshocked to discover that there is nothing out at the cinema at the moment\nthat I wanted to see (that I haven\u2019t al-ready). For example, this week for the\nfilm section I could choose between\nreviewing movies such as Marley & Me\nor The International, both of which\ndo not appeal to me in the slightest.\nSo if you are like me, and are stuck for\nideas of things to watch, then it is time\nto dust off the DVD\u2019s from your shelf,\nset your TV to record random films, or\nsign up to a film mailing site, and start\nto broaden the horizons of your film\ntaste. And because Easter is beginning\nto loom around the corner, I decided\nto reminisce about films with Easter\nthemes in. So why not venture into\nthe unknown and join me by watching\nfilms you might not otherwise choose\nto see?\nEaster Parade\nI think that this is the only film ever\nmade with \u2018Easter\u2019 in the title, and a\nfilm that focuses on the actual holiday itself. Starring Fred Astaire and\nJudy Garland, this is a musical about a\nman who decides that the next woman\nhe meets he will turn into a dancing\nsensation, and so he luckily bumps\ninto Judy Garland. Her dream is to be\na famous dancer and to one day walk\ndown 5th Avenue in New York in the\nEaster Parade wearing a big hat. There\nis lots of singing and dancing, and to be\nhonest I don\u2019t really remember the film\nvery well, just that her life ambition is\nto wear a big hat in an annual parade.\nWhen thinking about it, this film isn\u2019t\nreally about Easter at all, except for the\nfact that everyone seems to want to One more! But this bunny looks slightly less friendly don\u2019t you think?\nStefan Carpanu\nmade (or what kind of movies in\ngeneral), because the marketplace\nwill never come up with ideas - it will\nonly consume the next best thing.\nThe genre needs a story to revive it, an\nactual story as opposed to a series of\nscares and massacres strung together.\nIt needs a Wicker Man, a Psycho,\nan Alien, an Exorcist, some Birds, a\nShining \u2013 hell, even a Nosferatu. Or\nmaybe, just maybe, all it really needs\nis something completely different.\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nOne bunny down. Any more?\nwalk down a street on Easter Sunday\nwearing big hats\u2026\nChocolat\nNow this is a film about Easter! The\nfilm opens on the first day of Lent, and\nthe main villain of the film gives up\nchocolate just as Vianne (Juliette Binoche) opens a chocolate shop. The small\nFrench town is cold and unwelcoming\nto her, but she quickly wins over the\nhearts of everyone through the magic\nof chocolate (I tell you, if someone\nwanted to give me chocolate for free, I\nwould be their friend too). This film is\na heart-warming tale of love and loss,\nand Johnny Depp makes a brief appearance as a gypsy that Vianne falls\nin love with. Ending on Easter Sunday,\neveryone learns valuable lessons about\nthemselves, life and love. How sweet\u2026\n(what a terrible pun).\nThe Passion Of the Christ\nI had to put something religious\nhere, as after all, Jesus\u2019 crucifiction and\nresurrection is what Easter is all about.\nFollowing the last few days of Jesus\u2019\nlife, the film tells us about his disciples,\nhis family and his teachings through\nvarious flashbacks, interspliced with\nsome truly shocking torture scenes\nthat demonstrate what Christ suffered\nbefore being crucified. When this film\ncame out it caused a media storm and\nhad a lot of controversy surrounding it,\nbut if you are a Christian or a lapsed\nChristian, this film gives a good idea\nof what the message of Easter is. And\neven if you aren\u2019t religious, this film is\nstill very powerful and interesting to\nwatch, even though it is brutally gory.\nThe Prince of Egypt\nI haven\u2019t forgotten my Jewish cous-ins- don\u2019t worry! They had their claim\non this time of the year for a holiday\nfirst (I am referring to Passover). And\nalthough this film appeals to both Jewish people and Christians, it does feature Moses, God, Ramesses II, freed\nslaves and Passover, so I feel the Jewish community have more stake in the\nfilm. An animated classic, this movie\nfollows Moses as he tries to free his Hebrew brethren from being slaves to an\nEgyptian Pharaoh. Cue the Ten Plagues\n(scary!) and the moment Passover hap-pens- the angel of death is coming and\nif you don\u2019t put lamb blood on your\ndoor he will kill your first-born child!\nFeaturing an all-star cast (including\nSandra Bullock, who I am secretly in\nlove with), this film is a good watch,\nand includes a catchy song by Whitney\nHouston and Mariah Carey.\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit\nOkay, so this has absolutely nothing\nto do with Easter. But it does feature\na bunny rabbit as the main character,\nso I am kind of inclined to give this\nfilm a mention. If you haven\u2019t seen it,\nyou must, as it is brilliant. Set in San\nFrancisco in the 40\u2019s a detective is\nhired to solve the murder of a Cartoon\nStudio owner, the main suspect being\nan A-List Toon, Roger Rabbit. Now\nthis might sound strange, but this film\nmixes live action with cartoons, and\nhas cameos from Mickey Mouse, Bugs\nBunny and Daffy Duck. Yes it is weird,\nbut it is extremely clever and well plot-ted, and also features every man\u2019s favourite cartoon character, Jessica Rabbit (if only she were real\u2026). Although\nit seems like it is for children, it is very\nadult, with gruesome murders and one\nof the scariest villains ever (if you could\nmake swords pop out of your eye balls\nthen I would be scared of you too). So\ndon\u2019t be fooled into thinking it is for\nchildren, as it has universal appeal.\nBill and Ted\u2019s Bogus Journey\nSo now I am really getting further\naway from Easter. But actually, this film\ndoes feature an evil Easter Bunny that\nlives in Hell and tries to torture one of\nthe main characters. Odd, yes. Maybe\nyou have to have seen this as a child to\nappreciate it. A sequel to Bill and Ted\u2019s\nExcellent Adventure, this one is about\ntwo evil robots sent back in time to kill\nBill and Ted (so they end up going to\nHell) so that their music doesn\u2019t save\nthe world from becoming a utopian society (because in the late 80\u2019s/early 90\u2019s\npeople believed that rock music was so\npowerful that is could save the world).\nHmm\u2026 an evil pink Easter Bunny, the\nGrim Reaper and some weird creatures\nthat God creates all add up to a very\nstrange, drug induced movie. Well, it\nstill sounds better than Marley & Me.\nOther films with Easter themes\ninclude:\nThe Miracle Maker\nClaymation film that chronicles Jesus\u2019 life through the eyes of a young\ngirl.\nDonnie DarkoPsychological drama featuring a\nslightly disturbing bunny rabbit that\npredicts the end of the world.\nOctopussy\nA James Bond film all about a Faberge Egg.

At the Humanities\u2019 exhibition\nspace there is currently an exhibition\nof wildlife drawings aimed at raising\nawarness about wildlife and biodiversity issues.\nNicolas Philippakis, featured artist,\nhas spent most of his life in England,\nbut was also educated in Greece and\nSouth Africa. He went to secondary\nschool in Oxford (England) and then\nstudied law at the University of NotMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\ntingham. Nicolas has been doing artwork as a fun hobby in various forms\nsince his early childhood.\nFinding the legal profession far too\nconstricting, he decided to make a life\nchange and get back to art, his first love.\nWhile in South Africa he had been on\nsafari with his family, he became interested in wild animals and came to appreciate their diversity, living freely in\na natural environment.\nNowadays many species are threatened with extinction. The drawings on\ndisplay in the Humanities department\nat Imperial College are offered as a\nreminder of the beauty of our wildlife\nheritage.\nClimate change and green issues are\nnow at the forefront of many young\nstudents\u2019 consciousness and Nicolas\nbelieves that more attention to the\nnatural environment is essential as so\nmuch of it is being destroyed before\nour very eyes.\nThe original drawings were created\nin pencil and, in the case of the cheetah and gazelle picture, in charcoal.\nNicolas used shades of black and grey\nto make the images stand out clearly in\nthe art space provided. The works on\ndisplay at Imperial are gicle prints of\nthe original and are a limited edition of\ntwenty each. Prices are available at the\nHumanities Department Reception in\nthe Sherfield Building.\nWatch this space for the colourful\nupcoming science comics exhibition\nthat will go up simultaneously at the\nHumanities and virtually in Second\nLife at the House of Science: http://\nslurl.com/secondlife/Haddath/79/99/\n69/?title=Zoonomian.\nJust how creative can a scientist be? If\nyou look at any scientific innovation\nyou will find it already has its roots in\nnature. It seems scientists and engineers are merely inspired by what they\nsee every day in plants and creatures.\nThe Technology, Entertainment,\nDesign conference (TED) is held annually and invites some of the world\u2019s\nmost inspired thinkers to share their\nviews on science, business and the arts.\nThe event had previously been hosted\nby the likes of Bill Gates, Al Gore and\nJane Goodall. This year\u2019s conference is\ntaking place in Oxford in July.\nThe subject of learning from evolution was touched on in one of these\nlectures by UC Berkeley biologist\nRobert Full. Full believes that examples from nature are sometimes overNature\u2019s design: are engineers ever creative?\nengineered for the purpose that we re-quire. The challenge for the engineers\nis that they should only consider the\nnecessary details, and the example\nhe gives is of building an automobile\nwhich has, inside it, a factory in which\nyou can make another automobile.\nFull\u2019s research concerns locomotion\nin robots and studying techniques in\nnature that allow creatures to go, ba-sically, anywhere. He found that two,\nfour, six and eight legged creatures\nall exert similar forces on the ground;\nthey all bounce and can be modelled\nas spring-mass systems or, in simpler\nterms, a pogo stick.\nHe went on to work together with\nmathematicians to create a model\nwhich imitates this movement and\nfound that the model was able to self-stabilise without being directly aware\nof its surroundings, allowing it to\novercome many obstacles in its path.\nThis shows that it is the structural\nform of the animals which allow them\nto move so freely, without them having\nto even comprehend these obstacles.\nFull collaborated with other scientists and engineers from Berkeley and\nStanford to write a paper; \u2018Biomimetic\nDesign and Fabrication of a Hexapedal\nRunning Robot\u2019 which includes his research and also the results of implementing this model in a robot named\nSprawl.\nAnother nature-inspired design is\nVelcro. The idea for it came to Swiss\nengineer George de Mestral after returning from a hunting trip with his\ndog when he took a close look at the\nburrs of burdock that kept getting\nstuck in his dog\u2019s fur.\nWhen he examined them under a\nmicroscope, he discovered that there\nOne of the drawings at the exhibition\nA gecko\u2019s foot: it could inspire technology that would allow\nSpiderman-like abilities of climbing the walls\nLegendary Spiderman: inspired by nature\nScience science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOmar Mustufvi were many tiny hooks that caught on\nanything with a loop; such as animal\nfur or clothing.\nBut most of the secrets within nature are hidden in a region which cannot even be explored by a microscope;\nthe nano-realm. And it is only recent\nadvancements in microscope technology which have allowed this region to\nbe explored.\nIt was in this nano-realm that the\nmystery of how geckos are able to\nclimb even the most slippery of surfaces was revealed.\nWhen examined, the foot of a gecko\nappears to be covered with many millions of hairs, and each of these hairs\nbranch off into smaller hairs (like split-ends).\nThis huge rug of hairs on the feet\ncreates a huge surface area contact,\nand it is the sum of the tiny Van-derWaals forces from each of these hairs\nwith a surface that allows the gecko to\nliterally stick onto any surface.\nThis technology has already been\npatented for use as adhesives in microsurgery and microelectronics; soon we\ncan even expect to see people walking\nup walls with gecko inspired boots!\nGoing back to the original question\nof whether scientists and engineers\ncan be creative and innovative at all\nsince nature usually gets there first,\neven though many of the ideas are inspired by nature, there are still huge\ndiversities in the applications of the\ntechnologies. Hence innovation and\ncreativity is always required in a scientist to design for the specific function.\nMany more secrets are being held by\nnature, and the prospects for scientists\nand engineers depend on how deep\nthey explore.\n\u201cNicolas has\nbeen doing\nartwork since his\nearly childhood\u201d\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 James Goldsack & Katya-yani Vyas\nMinimum alcohol pricing proposal\nOn Monday the Chief Medical Officer\nfor England, Sir Liam Donaldson, unveiled a proposal for a minimum price\nfor alcohol of 50p per unit in an effort\nto reduce the burden upon society as a\nresult of excessive drinking.\nSir Donaldson has stated that \u2018we\nneed to think, rather like we did with\nsmoking, that it isn\u2019t just the effect on\nthe individual that drinks, and smokes,\nit\u2019s the effect also, on other people, the\ncollateral damage\u2019. Currently the annual cost to the NHS due to alcohol abuse\nis \u00a32.7bn, while the total expense to the\ntaxpayer due to the misuse of alcohol is\nthought to be in the region of \u00a325bn.\nResearch carried out by the University of Sheffield last year concluded that\nincreasing the price of alcohol would\nbe one of the most effective measures\nof combating alcohol abuse, as the effect would be greatest on the most\nheavy drinkers, while according to Sir\nDonaldson at least, the price increase\nfor a moderate drinker would be in the\nregion of \u00a31 per month.\nUnder his proposals a typical bottle\nof wine could not be sold for less than\n\u00a34.70, the price of a 2 litre bottle of\nStrongbow would almost double, a 10\npack of Stella would increase by almost\na quarter, and a bottle of Smirnoff vodka would increase by almost 20%. Of\ncourse, if you were to enjoy the homeless lifestyle of supermarket own brand\ndrinks, then the price increase would\nbe crippling.\nSupermarket prices are often cited\nas a cause of binge drinking, with supermarkets actually losing money on\nsome promotions which are designed\nto bring in customers. By imposing a\nminimum price on alcohol the prices\nat supermarkets would of course in-crease, and with no suggestion of this\nincrease being returned to the government through tax, the increase in\nprice would result in little more than\nan increase in profits for supermar-kets. Also the price of all alcohol, not\njust that at or under the 50p per unit\nwould have to increase, as if a bottle\nof \u2018wine\u2019 previously costing \u00a32.50 is to\nincrease in price to \u00a34.70, then a bottle of wine that was originally \u00a34.70\nwould have to increase in price for it to\nbe distinguished from the \u2018wine\u2019. So it\nwould seem that one of the main beneficiaries of imposing a minimum price\nfor alcohol would be the supermarkets\nwho are often blamed as being one of\nthe causes.\nThe prime minster, Gordon Brown,\nis not currently backing the plan, saying \u2018We don\u2019t want the responsible,\nsensible majority of moderate drinkers\nto have to pay more or suffer as a result\nof the excesses of a minority\u2019. The conservative party have said that it is more\nimportanttofocusonpeople\u2019sattitudes\nJames Lees\nIf Sir Donaldson\u2019s proposal is accepted, cut-price alcohol may no longer be available from supermarkets\nSir Liam Donaldson proposes a stop to cheap sale of alcohol to curb the damaging effects of binge drinking\nEx-guerrilla victory for El Salvador\nRaz Jabary\nThis week saw the leftist FMLN party\ntake power in El Salvador for the first\ntime since the party\u2019s legalisation in\n1992. Mauricio Funes, a former CNN\nCorrespondent, won the Salvadoran\nnational elections on Sunday 15th\nMarch with a majority of 51% of the\nvotes. Although the results proved the\nrace was a tight one, analysts in fact\nalready speculated a leftist victory that\nwould oust the republican ARENA\nparty from power for the first time in\n20 years.\n\u2018It is the happiest night of my life\u2019, Funes told a crowd shortly after 90% of\nthe votes had been counted.\nThe FMLN is a former guerrilla\nmovement that fought a 12-year long\nbattle against the U.S.-backed Salvadoran military dictatorship from\n1980 to 1992, which left nearly 80,000\npeople killed. The conflict came to an\nend after the signing of several peace\naccords, which furthermore saw a\ngeneral amnesty being granted to the\nmembers of the group and allowed the\nparty to enter the political stage on a\nformal and recognised basis.\nFormer Salvadoran president Antonio Saca was a staunch ally of the Bush\nadministration and considered by the\nlatter to be one of America\u2019s three key\nallies in Bolivarian Latin America, next\nto Peru and Colombia, the latter which\ncontinues its own fight against the\nFARC rebel movement.\nWith a row of leftist presidents recently being elected in Latin American\ncountries, amongst which is Argentina, the political processes in Guatemala and Honduras as neighbours to\nEl Salvador are considered to have had\nan effect on the perception of Salvadoran public opinion with regards to\ntheir political preferences. Before that,\na majority of the Salvadoran population have had concerns about the lack\nof ruling experience of FMLN. Larry\nBirns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, claims that for a long\nto drink, instead of merely dealing with\nsupply and cost. The Lib Dems, on the\nother hand support putting an end to\n\u2018pocket-money priced\u2019 alcohol. Clearly\nif you enjoy a cheap drink there is 1\nparty to not vote for.\nIn Scotland however SNP ministers\nhave already officially put forward the\nidea of minimum pricing for alcohol. If\nthe measures were to be implemented\nthen Scotland would be the first country in Europe to take such a measure\nto deal with excessive drinking. Wales\nand Northern Ireland have also both\ndeclared an interest in the idea. Currently the heaviest drinkers in Europe,\nthe Luxembourgers, have no plans to\nend the party.\ntime \u2018Salvadorans had been afraid to\nvote for the FMLN in fear of reprisals\nfrom Washington\u2019. He told CNN International that the election of Barack\nObama as U.S. president as opposed to\nthe former administration could lead\nSalvadorans to expect a different view\nheld by American foreign policy.\nAfter his victory was announced,\npresident Funes said to \u2018seek a path of\nreconciliation\u2019 with the ARENA party\nin trying to book political progress and\nto have a common approach to tackling the financial difficulties imposed\nby the economic downturn which has\nalso affected this small Central American country.\nDespite the results, making the\nFMLN the ruling party, political analysts do not consider a radical change\nto be brought about between Salvadoran-US relations. Although having\nreceived a majority of votes, the FMLN\nin fact lacks the number of parliamentary seats needed for an absolute\nmajority in the country\u2019s National Assembly, which means future decisions\nhave to be consulted and agreed upon\nwith the opposition first, before being\nimplemented.\nUnder the banner \u201cUn Cambio Seguro\u201d, A Sure Change, Mauricio Funes from the FMLN party won the Salvadoran national elections on Sunday\n11\nFriday 20 March 2009 felix\n\n"

On the first day they played\nDundee, who were one of the championship favourites, and although they\nplayed hard, they eventually lost 2-0.\nAs a result, it meant that on Saturday\nthey had to win both games to qualify\nfor the semi-finals.\nTheir first match that day was against\nBirmingham at 9am and with some\ngreat play they managed to win the\ngame 2-1. Manchester were the next\nteam the girls had to face, and with sets\nbeing decided by only a few points they\nwere unlucky to lose the game 2-0. In\ntheir final match of the tournament,\nthe women\u2019s volleyball team were up\nagainst Durham for 5th place, however\nluck was not on their side and although\nthe match went to three sets, the final\none went Durham\u2019s way at 17-15.

Held at Imperial College\u2019s\nSilwood Park campus in the bucolic\nBerkshire surroundings, three scientists from different backgrounds\ndiscussed the issue of whether using\nair travel to get to conferences or to\nperform fieldwork was justifiable or\nhypocritical, given the significant (and\ngrowing) contribution of air travel\nemissions towards climate change.\nThe IPCC calculate that global emissions from flying make up 3.5% of total\ngreenhouse gases; this is predicted to\nrise to 15% by 2050.\nArguing the case for and against were\nSir Malcolm Green, founder of the\nBritish Lung Foundation, and former\nhead of the National Heart and Lung\nInstitute (NHLI), who has lately taken\nan interest in climate change with an\narticle published in the BMJ entitled,\n\u201cAre international medical conferences an outdated luxury the planet\ncan\u2019t afford?\u201d; Professor EJ MilnerGulland, head of the Imperial College\nConservation Science research group\nand founder of the Saiga Conservation\nAlliance; and Tim Coulson, Professor of Population Biology at Imperial\nand winner of the 2007 ZSL Scientific\nMedal.\nTo kick off the debate, Professor\nGreen outlined his belief that confer-ences, particularly large-scale medical\nconferences (some of which, for example the American Cardiology Society\u2019s annual shindig, host up to 45,000\npeople) are a separate matter to field-work. One \u201csmall\u201d (in medical terms)\nconference, of say 15,000 people, emits\nover 10,000 tonnes of carbon from researchers and doctors flying in from as\nmany as 50 different countries. To put\nthis in context, this is the equivalent of\nthe yearly emissions of 2000 UK citi-zens, 11,000 Indians, or 110,000 Chadians. As he put it, this is \u201ca significant\namount of CO2\u201d.\nHe then went on to estimate the total emissions from one year\u2019s worth\nof medical conferences \u2013 a rather\nconservative assumption of 60 in his\nthought experiment, split evenly between America, Europe and Asia/Australia \u2013 at around half a million Indian\npeople-years (i.e. per person yearly\nemissions); this equates to the CO2\nconsumption of well over 100 million\nhectares of rainforest.\nSo, how many conferences do ProFelix Whitton\nScience Correspondent\nI\nn early 1900s Nikola Tesla revolutionized the way we use electricity and paved the way for the\nlife-style of the 20th century.\nNow an electric car named after this great physicist is set to change\nthe way we drive in the 21st century.\nTesla Roadster is one of the first electric sports cars. It is stylish, fast and\nhas been making headlines all over\nthe world. Most recently, Boris Johnson wrote about the car in his column\nin the Telegraph. He says: \u201c...having\ndriven the Tesla I have something like\nthe same sense of revelation. Of course\nthis is not new technology, but electric\ncars have evidently reached a point of\ndevelopment where they are now in\nserious competition with conventional\nmachines.\u201d He enjoyed the ride in the\nfirst Tesla Roadster in Britain and obviously impressed asked: \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t\nwe be making similar batteries and\ncars in this country?\u201d\nTesla returns to electrify Europe\nThe car is produced in California by\nthe Tesla Motors company, but the first\nshipment of 250 cars for the European\nmarket is now available from their web-site. You can also join the waiting list\nfor the 2010 standard European edition.\nThe price is 99,000 euros. Being 100%\nelectric, with top speed of 200km/h and\nacceleration from 0-100 km/h in just\n3.9s, this car is designed to impress. So,\nnow you can save the environment and\navoid the congestion charge while driving an enviously cool car.\nBoris Johnson, London\u2019s mayor, recently announced plans to introduce\nthe electric car hire scheme in attempt\nto make London the \u201celectric capital of\nEurope\u201d. \u201cI think this [electric vehicle\ntechnology] is something we should be\nreally leading on.\u201d\n\u201cI think we should be making London\nthe electric capital of Europe, and that\u2019s\nwhy we are going to be greatly expanding our support for charging points\naround London.\u201d he told the Guardian.\nThe New York Times recently reported on another advance for the\nelectric car revolution. Shai Agassi\nfrom company called Better Place has\ngot several countries including Israel,\nNetherlands, Canada and Japan, signed\nup for the electric-car charging stations\nscheme. This scheme involves building\ninfrastructure that would allow electric\ncar drivers to exchange their batteries\nwhen they get low on energy. Instead\nof having to charge your battery every\ntime it gets low, you could just drive to\nthe closest station and get them to fit\nyou with a fully charged battery in just\na couple of minutes. Payment could be\nmade per battery exchange: pay-as-you-go, or by subscription, so you pay\ncertain amount monthly and you can\nexchange your batteries as often as you\nneed them. With these charging stations in place, there would be nothing\nstopping the electric car revolution. T\nhe technology is already here, and it is\ngood enough to replace the convetional\ncombustion engine cars. The main\nproblem so far were consumers afraid\nthey would run out of power in their\nelectric cars and be stuck; with new\ncharging stations in place one would\nnot have to worry about this. \u201cThe battery is a consumable part of the car, just\nlike gasoline,\u201d Mr. Agassi told the NYT.\n\u201cCars in the 1950s only went about 100\nmiles on a tank of gas, and that problem\nwas solved by installing an infrastructure of gas stations.\u201d\nThere are also several Europeanproduced electric cars, French Venutri Fetish comes in limited edition and\ncosts 297,000 euros, and still in concept\nphase are the Hungarian Antro Solo\nand Venturi Voltage.\nMico Tatalovic maps out the arrival of cool electric cars to Europe.\nFrench Venturi Voltage\nIs flying really bad for the environment and should we even be talking about it when they are bigger\nquestions still to be adressed?\nfessors Coulson and Milner-Gulland\nattend each year, the chair asked? Remarkably few, as it happens; Prof Coulson prefers smaller-scale workshops\n(large conferences, he said, are a \u201cwaste\nof time\u201d), and Prof Milner-Gulland\nonly flies to one a year (the Society for\nConservation Biology Annual Meeting, which is carbon neutral).\nAre there any points in favour of\nlarge conferences, asked Sir Green?\nThe usual arguments can be dismissed\neasily; meeting colleagues? only ones\nfrom your own country; sightseeing?\nmost conferences are held in \u201cgodawful\nplaces\u201d. So what draws such large numbers of people? Partly vested interests\non the part of organisers, conferences\ncentres, host cities, and big pharma\n(but there is a move towards video-conferences from some companies, for\nexample GlaxoSmithKline).\nThere is also, according to Sir Green,\nan unwillingness on the part of scientists to use new technologies \u2013 after all,\nbusinesses, financial institutions, oil\ncompanies, even teenagers have seen\nthe light of virtual get-togethers.\nProfessor Milner-Gulland was next\nto argue her case. Playing the devil\u2019s\nadvocate she professed to \u201cnot care\u201d\nabout her carbon footprint. The train,\nferry, bus... whatever alternative form\nof transport was available simply took\ntoo long, and she would rather spend\ntime with her family. To qualify her\nstatement, she said that flying was the\nleast of her \u201ceco sins\u201d \u2013 with only six or\nseven flights a year, she said \u201cI don\u2019t fly\nenough\u201d, and thinks the daily drive to\nwork and having a child are far more\nworthy of environmental damnation.\nAlthough we may beg to differ, she\ndoes have a point \u2013 long-haul flights\nare a necessary evil if your work relies\nupon you meeting people face to face\nin order to train them or gain their\ntrust.\nMilner-Gulland also questioned the\nvalue of offsetting one\u2019s flights \u2013 there\nis too much room for ambiguity, many\nschemes are open to abuse and un-trustworthy, and you can\u2019t even be sure\nof what you are doing is helping. In her\nopinion, you are better off giving your\nmoney to FFI (Flora and Fauna International) or Oxfam.\nFinally, Professor Coulson argued\nthat by even having this debate, we\nwere missing the point. Calling for\nfewer flights is akin to \u201cshuffling deck-chairs as the Titanic goes down\u201d; there\nare far greater problems requiring our\nfocus. The IPCC projections are stark.\nIn the near future vast tracts of agri-Science Museum launches online source for medical students\nMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\nBrought to Life: Exploring the History of\nMedicine is a new multimedia website.\nAt the heart of the first phase of the\nproject are 2,500 significant objects\ncovering centuries of medical history\nfrom around the world. While Brought\nto Life is aimed at GCSE History students studying the \u2018Medicine Through\nTime\u2019 module, and undergraduates\nstudying the history of medicine, the\nwebsite also includes material supporting other GCSE subjects and content for anyone with an interest in the\ntopic.\nSupported by the Wellcome Trust,\nthe website will provide access to\nitems from the Wellcome Trust collection held by the Science Museum.\nMany of these fascinating objects will\nN\nikola Tesla invented\nelectricity as we know\nit today. Without his\ninventions we could\nkiss goodbye to com-puters, TVs and radios, trains and\nneon lights. Tesla\u2019s invention of the\ninduction motor allowed alternating current to be produced and used\nworldwide, something unimaginable\nwith the way electricity was produced prior to his ideas.\nBorn in 1856, Tesla\u2019s teacher in\nGraz, Austria later told him it was\nimpossible to produce alternating\ncurrent; it would be \u201cperpetuum\nmobile\u201d, he said. Nevertheless, the\nCroatian-born genius, while walking one day in a park in Budapest\nand quoting his favourite passage\nfrom Goethe\u2019s Faust, suddenly had an\nidea that would change the world. He\nsketched a diagram on the sand in the\npark and later copied it to paper.\nAfter being ignored by European in-vestors, he travelled to New York with\nfour pennies, a sketch and a recommendation in his pocket. The recommendation was from the director of a\npower plant in Germany addressed to\nThomas Edison saying: \u201cI know two\ngreat men. One is yourself, the other\nis the young man in front of you\u201d.\nHowever, after doing some work\nfor Edison, who was reluctant to hear\nabout alternating current since he was\ninvesting in his ideas of direct cur-rent, Tesla was refused his salary and\nmade fun of. This was a beginning of\na life-long dislike of Edison, who was\npreviously his role-model, which culminated in Tesla\u2019s refusal to share a\nNobel prize for physics with him in\n1915, according to some.\nTesla was a pacifist and a humanist,\na man who wanted electricity to be\navailable to everyone for free. His wish\nto bring this free energy by a renewable source and by wireless transfer led\nhim to invest all he earned into new\nresearch and inventions. Sadly, this led\nto him dying penniless \u2013 even though\nmost of the world\u2019s economy was powered by his idea for electricity.\nYet, before his death he managed\nnot only to make possible wide scale\nuse and transfer of electricity but he\nalso invented the radio \u2013 not Marconi as is widely thought. He also\ntook the first ever X-ray photos, invented neon lighting and designed\nthe first ever remote control.\nHe also had some more bizarre\nideas; he attempted to design electric death rays that would lead to\ncessation of all wars, and came up\nwith a power plant that could reap\ncosmic energy and transmit electricity through the atmosphere or\nthe soil \u2013 so people would get the\nelectricity for free using simple receiving in-ground devices. His investors were (perhaps unsurprising-ly) reluctant to fund this research!\nTesla\u2019s vibrant life and strokes of\ngenius were often exploited by others due to his own high regard and\ntrust of others. Nowadays he is remembered by science and his legacy\ncontinues today.\nLast year marked the 150th anniversary of Tesla\u2019s birth in a small\nCroatian village of Smiljan to a religious Serbian family. Croatia and\nSerbia both proclaimed 2006 to be\nthe year of Nikola Tesla; postage\nstamps were dedicated to him and\nBelgrade airport was even renamed\nNikola Tesla Airport \u2013 praise indeed\nfor the Serbian genius.\nWho was Nikola Tesla?\nHungarian Antro Solo\nFrench Venturi Fetish\nAmerican Tesla Roadster\ncultural land will be lost, towns and\ncities will be at risk from rising sea\nlevels, and a significant amount of biodiversity will be at risk of extinction.\nTo cope, he argued, we should move\naway from petty debates on flying and\ndouble-glazing our homes, and instead\naddress broader questions on our \u201cwill\nand capability to re-engineer society\u201d.\nIt has quickly become apparent, he\nargued, that initial predictions for climate change were too conservative.\nTime is running out fast, and we need\nquick approaches such as geo-engi-neering (for example ocean seeding)\nand reducing population growth (as a\ndemographer, albeit of animals, Prof\nCoulson is certainly knowledgeable on\nthis subject). Perhaps most important-ly, as a society we \u201cmust think in more\nabstract ways\u201d in order to adapt and\nsurvive. If this involves getting brilliant\nminds together in large numbers, then\nthis is a necessary evil.\nThe debate was opened to the floor\nnext. Various people pointed out that\nsmall-scale individual action often felt\nlike it achieved nothing, which tends\nto foster apathy, especially in younger\ngenerations. On top of this, knowledge\nitself is not enough; to make a decision not to fly but to travel by train is\na luxury (albeit a less convenient one),\nand to have the luxury of such a choice\none needs resources. Thus, to gain resources requires flying to conferences\nto hobnob with superiors and (hope-fully) get a better job.\nProf Coulson agreed, saying that the\n\u201cbig ideas\u201d and technologies to deal\nwith climate change will only come\nfrom discussion between people from\ndifferent cultures and with different\nexperiences. Sir Green, on the other\nhand, argued that the responsibility\nfor making a difference lies with our\ngeneration, and that not flying costs no\nmoney and is something everyone can\naddress (as opposed to planting a for-est). He said we in the developed West,\nby not taking a lead on the matter, are\nnot only responsible but \u201ccomplacent\u201d.\nCoulson replied that even stopping\nall flights tomorrow would only buy us\na couple of years; to which Sir Green\nquoted the Chinese proverb: \u201cA journey of a thousand miles begins with\none step\u201d. Choosing not to fly is simply the most practical step available to\nmost of us.\nProf Milner-Gulland was asked if\nit was not possible to incorporate a\nphase-out of air travel with more local\ntraining of people in countries where\nconservationists, and other scientists,\nwork. Yes, she said, getting local people working is a crucial component of\nher work. However, conservation is an\ninternational discipline, and it remains\nimportant to have real, as well as vir-tual, contact with people.\nFinally, Sir Green drew an analogy\nwith the campaign against smoking,\nwhich began in the 1950s with a few\nscientists pitting their evidence against\nthe might of the tobacco companies,\nand ended with an EU-wide ban on\ntobacco advertising in 1991 (and of\ncourse, most recently with the ban on\nsmoking in public places in 2007). He\nsaid that it was important to focus on\nsomething \u201cdifficult but achievable\u201d,\nwhich with luck can result in a sea-change of opinion and behaviour.\nWhether or not in this crisis we have\nthe luxury of time afforded to the anti-tobacco brigade is doubtful, and this\nobserver isn\u2019t convinced that flying is\nthe right cause to focus on. There are\nother threats, some with a far greater\ncontribution towards carbon emis-sions; as NASA\u2019s top climate expert\nJames Hansen recently made clear,\n\u201cYou have to keep the eye on the ball\nand not waste your efforts. The number\none enemy is coal and we should never\nforget that.\u201d\nFelix Whitton is editor of\nwww.conservationtoday.org\nbe on view for the first time, while others are also on display in the Science\nMuseum galleries \u2018Science and Art of\nMedicine\u2019, \u2018Glimpses of Medical History\u2019 and \u2018Health Matters\u2019. These include\nRenaissance treasures such as rare\nanatomical wax models and books;\nearly surgical instruments; leech jars;\nartificial limbs and iron lungs.\nThe site initially covers ten themes,\nrising to sixteen in later phases,\nstretching back to the earliest forms\nof surgery and forward to the present\nday. They cover diseases and epidem-ics, medicine and belief, and the pioneers of medical science. Each subject\nis explored with detailed analysis and\ncommentary by expert historians and\ncurators.\nThe site\u2019s themes are explored using\ntext and multimedia, with each section\u2019s featured object linking in turn\nto a further 200-250 related exhibits.\nFollowing the launch on 2nd of March\n2009, Brought to Life will be further\ndeveloped, with 4,000 objects becoming available for close examination on\nthe site by 2011.\nProject Director Robert Bud, the\nScience Museum\u2019s Principal Curator\nfor Medicine, said: \u201cWe are proud to\nbe introducing a resource that is destined to become an acknowledged key\ntool for students and their teachers.\n..But as well as providing a vital serv-ice, it is also a new source of thousands\nof fascinating stories and facts which\nwill enthral anybody with an interest\nin medical history.\u201d\nClare Matterson, Director of Medicine, Society and History at the Wellcome Trust, commented: \u201cHenry Wellcome was an avid collector of anything\nand everything to do with medicine\nand culture, up until his death in 1936.\nBrought to Life is a wonderful complement to the galleries at Wellcome Collection, the Science Museum and else-where, which can only ever display the\ntip of the iceberg in terms of what he\nleft for future generations to explore.\n\u201cWhile the website is primarily\naimed at students, the vast range of\nobjects that can be viewed, along\nwith the accompanying detail, means\nBrought to Life is fascinating for everyone with an interest in the history of\nmedicine.\u201d\nThe new Tesla Roadster, as seen on Top Gear, you know you love it!\n\n"

And sud-denly, I knew; the harsh, cold tyranny\nof winter is over. That sound of loud,\ntin-ny chimes playing a barely recognisable version of \u201cGreensleeves\u201d\nand kids on the estate yelling, in their\nSouth London accents, \u201cICEEEEE\nCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAM!\u201d and \u201cGet\nyo money den dat\u2019s da ice cream truck!\u201d,\nalongside the sounds of doors slamming and kids running. And I admit, I\nfelt a pang of craving for ice-cream too\nbut at the same time I am 21, and like\nmost middle-class white chicks, I\u2019m\nstill a little bit scared of those kids who\nhave grown up on a council estate in\nSouth-east London with parents who\nlook like crystal meth addicts, I mean,\ndon\u2019t they all have guns and knives and\nshit? That\u2019s what The Daily Mail says\nanyway.\nAs soon as summer hits you have to\nadjust your iPod playlists for the change\nin weather and stop listening to all that\nmusic from the winter because it\u2019s not\nfresh any more. One of the things I\u2019ve\nbeen listening to is dance music with\nhorns that sound like Mark Ronson\nputting on a summer carnival rave in\nSE1. Mr Miyagi is a Swedish duo of\n\u201cone rock musician and one computer\ngeek\u201d according to their Myspace and\ntheir song \u201cWe Gonna Give You the\nLesson\u201d will make you wanna dance\nlike it\u2019s Brazil and everyone is only\nwearing glittery thongs and feathered head-dresses. Crookers, who you\nmight remember from that remix of\nKid Cudi\u2019s \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 night\u201d (I predicted\nthat would be big in my January article,\nyou read it here first!) has also got in on\nthe brass section action with \u201cGypsy P\u201d\nwhich sounds like a song you could\ndance to around a campfire, drinking\npsychadelic tea with Gogol Bordello.\nBut my favourite horn-related song\nof right now has to be Jesse Rose\u2019s\n\u201cTouch My Horn\u201d [Mad Kids remix],\na perfect blend of anthemic brass and\ntechno breaks \u2013 the perfect summer\ndance-track. Moving away from dance\nmusic, I\u2019ve also been listening to the\nsong \u201cObsessions\u201d by Marina & the\nDiamonds approximately twenty times\na day, every day for the past two weeks.\nIt\u2019s just that good. It\u2019s so beautiful it almost makes me cry. However no one in\nthe felix office seems quite as into this\nas I am, so my enthusiasm might just\nbe because I am an unashamedly massive Kate Bush fan and she sounds like\na cross between Kate Bush, Florence &\nthe Machine, and La Roux.\nMy other summer staple is always,\nhip-hop remixes. I mean the kind of\nhip-hop that reminds you of the Fresh\nPrince of Bel Air. Last year it was Kid\nSister with lyrics like \u201chelp your granny\nup out of her chair/if you wanna get\nloose say \u2018hell yeah\u2019 \u201d this year I don\u2019t\nknow what it\u2019s gonna be.

Also her\nMyspace has the worst design of all\ntime, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just supposed to be \u201cretro\u201d or something.\nHospitality\nMatters\nSteven Burgess\nTom Phillips reviews one of the biggest\nand best drum \u2018n\u2019 bass nights in London\nMicachu & the Shapes\nJewellery\nRough Trade\nHHHHI\n23\nFriday 20 March 2009 felix\nMusic\nF\nounded by Chris Goss and\nTony Colman (also known as\nLondon Elektricity) in early\n1996 in their west London\nstudio, Hospital Records was\nset up primarily to spread their own\nmusic within the drum and bass scene.\nSince then, it\u2019s grown to become one of\nthe biggest drum and bass labels in the\nworld, known for leaning towards liquid funk, a more melodic subgenre of\ndrum and bass, with nearly 300 releases as well as being home to some of the\nmost popular drum and bass produc-ers, like High Contrast and Nu:Tone.\nHospitality,thelabel\u2019sownclubnight,\nbegan in 1996 at Herbal in Shoreditch\nbut quickly spread out of London to\nCardiff, Brighton and even Berlin.\nHospitality soon outgrew its London\nvenue and moved to a hugely successful quarterly residency at Heaven.\nAt the end of September 2008, Heaven was sold by its previous owners and\nthe new owners decided in November\n\u2013 with just two weeks to go before the\ngig \u2013 to cancel the last Hospitality of\n2008. Even with the threat of legal ac-tion, no agreement was reached between Heaven and Hospitality to resolve the situation.\nThis led Hospital Records to make\nthe move to London\u2019s brand new Matter at the O2 Arena. Founded by the\nowners of Fabric, Cameron Leslie and\nKeith Reilly, the 2,600 capacity venue\ncan only be described as incredible.\nThe whole place is completely immer-sive. Capable of generating stiff breeze,\nno words could adequately describe\nthe clarity and quality of the phenomenal 200 speaker sound system in Room\nOne, and if you thought the BodySonic\ndance floor in Fabric\u2019s Room One vibrated a lot, you have got to experience\nthe latest incarnation, the BodyKinetic\ndance floor, at Matter. Along with your\nhair and clothes moving in the air, kick\ndrums pounding in your chest and\nyour whole body vibrating from the\nfloor, you\u2019ll see some top-class VJing\nprojected onto all of the walls.\nThe whole experience makes every pretentious West-end club (e.g.\nMaya, come on RCSU\u2026) seem like a\ncrap house party where all the tracks\nare streamed from YouTube and\nplayed back on a knackered iPod dock\nbought in the closing-down sale at\nWoolworths.\nHowever, you can have the best club\nenvironment in the world but without great DJs it\u2019ll fall flat on its face.\nHospital Records haven\u2019t let us down\nhere either. Room One kicked off with\nNu:Tone and Logistics for the first\ntwo hours who warmed up the slightly\nsparse crowd nicely with their smooth\nflowing, minimal mixes.\nStarting his hour-and-a-half set with\nsome impressive turn-tablism, Brazilian DJ Marky took it up a notch and\nthe dancefloor was soon heaving. Normally, I find scratching to be irritating\nand narcissistic because often it doesn\u2019t\nadd anything whatsoever to the music,\nbut here Marky skillfully integrated it\nunobtrusively and intricately into the\nmix.\nNational Drum and Bass 2009 award\nwinner (Best Liquid DJ) High Contrast\nfollowed with his trademark uplifting sets, although after DJ Marky he\nseemed a little predictable.\nLondon Elektricity hit the stage at\n2:30am. He played a great set with\ntracks from Mistabishi\u2019s new album\nDrop \u2013 \u2018Printer Jam\u2019 in particular sent\nthe crowd wild \u2013 and dubplates from\nnew artists recently signed to Hospital\nsuch as B-Complex and Sigma. However, the set wasn\u2019t perfect. TC\u2019s \u2018Where\u2019s\nMy Money\u2019 virtually stopped the dance\nfloor and even got a few boos from the\ncrowd, prompting London Elektricity\nto make a quick record change about\n15 seconds into the track.\nCyantific then showed off some of his\ntechnical skills, playing three records\nat once and his more techy sound was\na welcome change to the last two-and\n-a-half hours of liquid funk.\nRoom Two was dedicated entirely\nto dubstep all night. Although much\nsmaller than Room One, it is well\nsuited, both acoustically and atmos-pherically, to the darker side of elec-tronica. Rinse FM radio presenter NType played a mind-blowing set with\nsome really great tracks that kept the\nmix interesting, rather than the usual\ntwo-step garage beats and wobbling\nsub-bass.\nAfter last year\u2019s release of his amazing\ndebut album Diary Of An Afro Warrior,\nI was particularly excited about seeing\nBenga DJ at Hospitality, but he turned\nout to be a complete disappointment.\nAfter turning up 40 minutes late, he\nthen proceeded to invite so many of\nhis mates into the booth that he could\nbarely move to get to his record bag\nand spent so much of his time chatting to his friends that the mix was all\nover the place. Silence ensued after he\nseemed to forget completely where he\nwas and let the Skream remix of La\nRoux\u2019s \u2018Going In For The Kill\u2019 play to\nthe very end of the record. The look\non his face when he realised what had\njust happened was priceless. He also\nseemed to constantly mash his hand\ninto the beat repeat button at every\nopportunity. Did he just want us to go\nback into Room One so he could catch\nup with his friends? The MCs were aw-ful, one of whom seemed to only be\nable to make squealing monkey noises.\nBenga may be a great producer, but\nhe\u2019s a terrible DJ.\nBack in Room One, Bristol\u2019s Krust\nand Die rounded off what was, with\nthe exception of Benga, an extraordinary night. Hospitality will be back at\nMatter on 1st May with High Contrast,\nFabio, London Elektricity, Friction,\nCyantific, Danny Byrd, Skream and\nDJ Zinc. I\u2019ll definitely be going, and I\nthink you should too.\nBrazilian DJ Marky hits the mark with his renowned scratching and mixing skills\nDon\u2019t be put off by the name, despite\nsounding like a Japanese cartoon show\nthese pocket monsters have produced\na diamond of an album which sparkles\nin the Rough Trade catalogue. Hailing\nfrom London, the 21 year-old Mica\nLevi a.k.a. Micachu, along with Marc\nPell and Raisa Khan (The Shapes) are\na spit-ball in the face of the indie es-tablishment. They have produced a\ncollection of twisted three minute pop\nsongs, a nicotine fuelled, manic ciggy\nrush and the perfect antidote to the insipid wave of morbid rock produced by\nthe White Lies \u2013 just what the doctor\nordered for 2009.\nA graduate from Guildhall Music\nSchool, Mica has already written a\nscore for the London Philharmonic\nOrchestra as part of a young composers project and releasing her own grime\nmix tapes \u2018Filthy Friends\u2019. The debut album Jewellery is released off the back\nof an NME Awards show appearance\nand precludes extensive touring across\nthe UK, US and Europe.\nIn constant decay, Jewellery skims\nthe edge of sanity, knitting together a\nloose alliance of influences from low-fi\nto dubstep to hip-hop busting to break\nloose. Abrasive from the start \u2018Vulture\u2019\nerupts with the energy of the Libertines\nsetting the tone for a relentless assault\nof out-of-tune guitars and distorted\nsamples mastered with the quirky ingenuity of a young Beck.\nThreaded through with prickly lyr-ics, from the bitter \u201clie all the time you\nstill get by\u201d, \u201cI was told I have a sell by\ndate\u201d to the direct \u201cshe stole all my\nmoney, the f---ing thief\u201d backed with\nshouts, crushed and perverted sounds\nMica builds up a monument of burnt\nnerves, pent-up anger and young lust\nin modern London.\nThe infectious \u2018Curly Teeth\u2019 employs an R&B section so catchy one\ncould imagine Missy Elliot sliding into\nview then taking forward electro-pop,\n\u2018Golden Phone\u2019 sounds like a grimy\nHot Chip track and \u2018Just In Case\u2019 sees\nLily Allen meet Bjork in her Homogenic days with a fierce low-fi\naccompaniment.\nThis album owes alot to\nhours spent on sampling\nsoftware and harnesses\na diverse array of sounds\nthat would make the Flaming Lips proud. This is best\nexemplified by \u2018Turn Me\nWell\u2019 which boasts a vacuum\ncleaner in its ensemble \u2013 art is\nlife, life is art.\nIn the end, this a debut album\nwith an irrepressible punk\nsensibility and it will\nbe interesting to\nsee where Micachu will take\nher sound next.\nHowever questions of the future are out of\njoint with the\nalbum\u2019s out-look, so for the\nmoment seize\nthe day and\nenjoy this offering of raw,\npainful youth.\nMonday\n12:00 \u2013 14:00 IKOBETRADIO\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 Capital Cuts\n18:30 \u2013 20:00 Pick \u2018n\u2019 Mix\n20:00 \u2013 21:30 Peer Pressure\n21:30 \u2013 23:30 The Students \t\t\nWant Techno\nTuesday\n12:00 \u2013 12:45 Capital Science\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 Science at One\n14:00 \u2013 15:30 Beyond the Hype\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 Maggie\u2019s Thatch\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 It\u2019s All About the \t\t\nMusic\n19:00 \u2013 20:00 Believe the Hype\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 White Noise\nWednesday\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 Eye on Science\n14:00 \u2013 15:00 The Indie Show\n16:00 \u2013 18:00 The Flagship \t\t\nShow\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 1 for the Heads\n19:00 \u2013 20:00 Off Beat\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 DJ Chainz Ice \t\t\nCream Hour\n21:00 \u2013 23:00 Pirate IC Radio\nThursday\n12:00 \u2013 13:00 Belated Hype\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 Dead Air Space\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 Papercuts\n17:00 - 18:00 The Metal Hour\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 Nath and Yuvi\u2019s \t\t\nHappy Hour\n19:00 \u2013 21:00 Instrumental\n21:00 \u2013 23:00 The Spectre \t\t\nShow\nFriday\n14:00 \u2013 15:00 Free Music\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 Science Jam\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 Peter & James\n19:00 \u2013 20:00 The DC Sessions\n20:00 \u2013 00:00 Music Tech \t\t\nSessions\nSaturday\n11:00 \u2013 13:00 VPT\n15:00 \u2013 17:00 Yes We Can\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 \t\t\t\t\nHypercommunication\nSunday\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 The Pop Show\n17:00 \u2013 19:00 The G & T Show\n19:00 \u2013 21:00 The Roushan \t\t\nAlam Show\n21:00 \u2013 23:00 The Crack Den\nWhat?

The place reeked\nof testosterone and the demographic\nwas worse than an EEE lecture theatre.\nI was the only girl tucking into a plateful of food and others were nervously\nholding a dainty soup spoon in hand,\nwhile watching their male companions\nscoff. So in conclusion, what the MDH\nneeds is a MASSIVE salad bar and a\nmakeover. Answers on a postcard.\nI needn\u2019t rip the Union food to\nshreds. We all know its crap, so how\ncan we make it better? I was at Warwick University last week visiting Little Rosie (sister, not daughter) and we\ntreated ourselves to a meal out at their\nUnion. In a space no bigger than Da\nVinci\u2019s, they managed a nice looking,\nwell cooked plate of food for a fiver. I\nwas very impressed. Sure, it was just\na small step up from Wetherspoon\u2019s\nfood, but the portions were immense,\nas was the choice of food on offer.\nStudents were packed round tables\nsharing piles of steaming wedges and\ntucking into steak baguettes or lasagne and salad. No doubt it would be a\nlogistical nightmare for such a simple\nidea to come to fruition at the Union\nbut Warwick\u2019s utopian eatery did make\nme wonder\u2026\nWhen I saw David\u2019s recipe for this\nweek\u2019s food section my mouth immediately started watering. I have tried to\navoid that cliche for so long, but when\nyou\u2019re faced with a photo of glistening\npasta with shiny peas and scallops it\u2019s\nimpossible to resist. This dish would\nbe perfect to cook for your loved one\nthis Saturday night. For fish-sceptics,\njust omit the scallops or replace it with\nmore bacon. James \u2018I eat your soul for\nbreakfast\u2019 Copley went to Hell this\nweek. From what I can tell from his ac-count, in Hell there are lots of Austrailans plying you with very spicy pizza. I\nthink we can expect to see more of Hell\nin the next few years as this Antipodean franchise of spooky pizza takeouts\nexpands onto British soil. Don\u2019t worry\n- Hell is just like Dominos with more\nchilli and bats!\nI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s the end of term\nalready. You may insert a cliche about\ntime going as fast as a fast thing, here.\nHappy Easter, folks. See you next term!\nIn Hell, there are Kiwis\nRoad), through dreary old Fulham. If\nthe underworld is this innocuous I really ought to start sinning more often.\nSo, what makes this place so hellish then? Basically, it is your standard pizza joint, but with all manner of\ndemons, fire and bats lurking about\nthe walls and ceiling. The pizzas are\ngiven suitable names, seven named after the deadly sins. Interestingly, \u2018Lust\u2019\ncontains only meat toppings, whereas\n\u2018Sloth\u2019 inexplicably is based on tuna\nand mushrooms.\nElsewhere there is the standard half-arsed array of pastas and salads, but\nthis is really all about the pizza. Which\nis what makes the fact that the pizza\ntastes exactly like Domino\u2019s all the\nmore disappointing. Hell Pizza claim\nto be all about \u201cbig flavours\u201d and not\nabout \u201cold Italian recipes\u201d, but this is\ntheir downfall. The pizzas are irritatingly thick and the toppings piled on\nwith abandon, raping the taste buds.\nSeveral pizzas are available on a Nando\u2019s style spice scale, but be warned:\nstereotypes of Australasian machismo\nstand true. Opting for the second hottest option, the auspiciously named\n\u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 for my \u2018Mischief\u2019 pizza, I\nwas confronted with obscene amounts\nof barely cooked chilli. Perhaps this\nwas to mask the fact the supposed\nchorizo had the texture of a frankfurt-er. Elsewhere they use sauces to similar\neffect: the \u2018Mordor\u2019 arrives saturated\nHell Pizza HHH\n369 North End Road\nFulham, SW6 1NW\n08456 666 999\nwww.hellpizza.co.uk\nBest: Hellish decor and matching coffin pizza boxes\nWorst: Antipodean chilli scales\non a mild, British palate\nPrice: All you can eat pizza for\n\u00a36 on Tuesdays. Snack pizzas\nfrom \u00a34.50 and giant ones from\n\u00a39.\nTakeout: Hell delivers to most\nplaces north of the river. Battersea dwellers dispair.\nwith a barbecue sauce that could have\nbeen made of pure treacle.\nHell Pizza came into existence in\nthe mid 1990\u2019s in New Zealand, and\nthough the food served is (very loose-ly) Italian in origin, the ethos could not\nbe more antipodean if you named it\nBruce. Now the second largest pizza\nrestaurant chain in New Zealand, they\nare spreading their damned seeds\naround the western world with outlets\nsoon to open in Ireland and Canada.\nSome gentle Wikipedia research suggests that they are famous on their native continent for controversial advertising campaigns including giving out\nfree condoms with their \u2018Lust\u2019 pizza\nand, brilliantly, using \u201cthe skeletal remains of Heath Ledger and the Queen\nMother dancing on their gravestones\u201d\nfor their Hallowe\u2019en campaign.\nThese reservations aside, on Tuesdays Hell offer a \u00a36 All You Can Eat\ndeal which is excellent value if you\nhappen to be in the Fulham area with\na group of friends and have already\nstarted drinking. Arrive hungry, gorge\nyourself, and be damned with the inevitable stomach ache. Also, highly commendable is the takeaway packaging - a\ncoffin shaped box \u2018For Your Remains\u2019.\nLol. Provided you\u2019re not expecting\ngood food, the Hell experience can\nbe quite good fun. Infintely superior\npizza is widely available elsewhere, but\nI would wager nowhere has bats.\nA\ns a treat this week, Felix decided to send me\nto Hell. Naturally, I had\nsome initial reservations.\nFire and brimstone are\njust a touch strong for my delicate pal-ate. However, this was before I was told\nHell contained pizza. Homer Simpson\nsold his soul for a measly donut; this\nwas a bloody big pizza.\nEternal damnation notwithstanding,\nI ventured down the Highway to Hell\n(previously known as the North End\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 20 March 2009 felix\nFood\nJames Copley finds Hell on North End Road. What\u2019s new, eh?\nO\nne month and counting\u2026 I\u2019m still waiting\nfor that bunch of reduced roses promised\nto me for Valentine\u2019s\nDay. My stubborn Mr Rosie vetoed\nValentines Day this year because he,\nas a bloke, felt pressurised into being\nromantic and loving. I do agree with\nhim on some level \u2013 men find it hard\nenough without large pink signs reminding them on every corner about\nthat inevitable day when everything\nhas a \u2018love\u2019 premium.\nSo as a consequence of his anti-Valentines Day anger, I was promised\nroses when they were reduced but even\non Anti-Valentines Day (14th March),\nthey hadn\u2019t arrived. This fabled day\namong the romantically suppressed\nmen of this modern society is also\nknown as \u2018Steak and Blow Jobs Day\u2019. In\nmy opinion, all these \u2018feast\u2019 days have\ngotten out of control \u2013 in both these\ncases (14/2 and 14/3) we should live\nlife like the Mad Hatter does.

Let\u2019s\nstick to food \u2013 it\u2019s safer.\nWhat with all these elections that\nhave been a-happening in the previous weeks, a lot of promises have been\nmade concerning our welfare and everyone on the election wagon seems to\nbe concerned with the quality of food\nthat we\u2019re ingesting at Imperial. I will\nadmit that the Union food stinks, but\nI really think we should be more grateful for resources such as the MDH. I\nrediscovered the MDH the other day\nafter a 2 year lapse in Sandwich Shop\nand SAF limbo. No, it is not haute cui-sine, but I think we all forget that we\nare students and we should be thankful that for \u00a34.40 we can eat ourselves\nsilly in the Sherfield Building.

Banks have\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness\nBusiness Editor \u2013 Luke Dhanoa\n7\nFriday 20 March 2009 felix\nWhat goes down\nmust come up?\nSina Ataherian\nThe global recession - or in the case\nof China, slightly slower growth \u2013 has\nbeen about the biggest thing to happen\nrecently. It has affected us financially;\nmany students now pay less interest on\ntheir loans. It has prompted changes in\ncareer directions. It has even renewed\nthe raison d\u2019\u00eatre of 24 hour news chan-nels. Its level of coverage has been\nlike a new Iraq, but relevant to home\naudiences. According to Rob Arnott,\nformer editor of Financial Analysts\nJournal, in real terms the fall has only\nbeen exceeded by the Railway bubble\nbursting in the 1850s and the great\ndepression.\nNow that the sub-prime problem has\nbeen successfully post-predicted by\nnetwork news analysts and some lessons have perhaps been at least temporarily learned, should we see opportunity in our current woes? Downturns\nare remarkably consistent in immediately following great booms and then\nslowly recovering over a few years,\nalbeit not to previous peaks. The sentiment that equities should have been\npunished, but not so much, is now\nwidespread. As is the feeling that many\nstock prices, particularly financials, are\nnow \u2018cheap\u2019. The odds seem to be leaning towards buying stocks in many of\nthe worst hit sectors.\nWith most stock markets now worth\naround half their peak values it is\ntempting to think valuations should\nrevert to their mean. Relatively well\nmanaged banks such as HSBC and\nDeutsche seem unfairly damned to collective punishment of the sector. Concern has largely gone back to returns\non capital rather than return of capital.\nT\nhere are lots of ways that\nthe recession is hurting\nbusiness, but the calamitous grey clouds hanging\nominously over the country do have a silver lining. Right now is\nprobably the best time to be starting up\na business and since you (Imperialites)\nare exactly the sort of people who have\nthe intellectual assets required to do\nso, this recession could prove to be the\nbest thing that ever happened to you.\nIf you look through history, the global economy has almost always been\npulled out of recessions by innovations\nand new technologies. The most recent example is how the recession of\nthe late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s was ended\nby the gains from the development of\ninternet and communication technologies where the radical innovation and\nspread of microelectronics was key to\nglobal growth. But if you look at the\nfirms that pioneered this new era, they\nwere often rookie firms and start-ups\nguided by young new innovators - and\nif history is any judge, we may be about\nto see the same thing happen again.\nThe current economy has almost perfect conditions for new start ups and\nthe business section of felix would be\ndoing you disservice if we didn\u2019t do our\npart to encourage you to go and start\nup a new firm.\nThe first thing that a new firm would\nneed is an idea, and since you\u2019re a\nbright, young thing you may have one\nof your own, but if you don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t\nworry.

Book values now\ndwarf the market capitalisation of all\nmajor banks and financial institutions.\nSome speculators are even beginning\nto see general avoidance of financials\nas irrational herding behaviour just\nlike that leading up to most big booms\nand subsequently inevitable busts.\nLast week Goldman Sachs estimated\nthe fair value of the American equity\nmarket at 47% above current prices. It\nreckoned the equilibrium level, which\nassumes long-term return to a normal\nappetite for risk, was 72% above the\ncurrent value. Many traders have been\npredicting for some time that the worst\nis over and that the market is waiting\nfor a trigger for recovery. The Dow approaching 6500, a level below which\nmany thought it would not sink, was\nwidely predicted as one such potential\ntrigger.\nThis happened around March 9th\nand the chart for the last few months\ncan now be seen literally kicking back.\nThe opportunity to buy low and hopefully sell high in maybe as little as a year\nis now irresistible to many. Whilst they\nmay well be right, they must remember that the growth between 2003 and\n2007 resulted from the coincidence of\na unique combination of factors. Technological factors, rapid growth in the\nwidening club of emerging markets\nand unsustainable lending and bor-rowing, predominantly in Anglo-Saxon economies, amongst other causes\nof growth, collided together. These are\nunlikely to simultaneously reoccur in\nthe near future.\nNonetheless before all this, the\ngrowth of equity markets seemed a\nlong term trend. Even the worst of the\nmany global financial incidents of recent decades represented road bumps\nin the road to higher prices. Even prior\nto the boom before this latest bust, the\nDow seemed stable at around 10000\ndespite relatively recent recovery from\nthe .com boom. But could something\nabout this one be unique?\nNiall Ferguson, the financial version\nof Simon Schama, views this as an evolutionary process. History, he argues,\nis rife with examples of weaker financial systems and companies giving way\nto the strong. This process may even\nbe hastened by Brown and Mandelson campaigning for tougher global\nregulation.\nThe industry may be on the life support of government bailout, as many\nof us are frequently reminded by disgruntled engineering lecturers, but\nit cannot stay that way for ever. The\nstronger firms and better practices\nhave emerged dominant. Some, notably HSBC, are even cautiously talking\nof the potential possibility of maybe\nexpanding perhaps, taking advantage\nof the low share prices of their compet-itors. Warren Buffet, the most successful value investor of all time, is noted\nfor preferring \u201can outstanding company at a sensible price\u201d rather than weak\nones at rock-bottom.\nSo it may just about be the right time\nto expect a slow return to long-term\ngrowth in equity markets. Stocks may\nnot quite be as low as they can go, but\ntheir current values do provide a cush-ion, at least for those willing to stick\naround for a few years. It may be time\nto go long on the companies that have\nsuffered from the recent troubles, but\nprobably not yet those that caused\nthem.\nalready started investing in the property market and REITs (hedge funds\nfor property) are expected to have\nan exceptional five years. The credit\ncrunch hasn\u2019t just destroyed credit \u2013\nit has forced it to be re-allocated, and\nstart-ups with strong ideas are poised\nto take those investments.\nOn top of private funding there are\ndozens of ways in which the state is\nset to help you out. The government\nis currently trying to make the UK\nmore competitive and innovative and\nthere is a strong case for them to support the next Microsoft in the UK. As a\nbusiness owner you may be eligible for\ngovernment grants, tax relief and public contracts. Provided you\u2019re helping\nthe economy, there is a case for them\nto help you.\nAnd once you have funding, in the\ncurrent climate it goes further than it\nused to. People are cheaper than they\nused to be. Government backed mortgages are cheaper. Commodities are\ncheaper. Land is cheaper. Office space\nis cheaper. Services (except for bank-ing) are cheaper. And what\u2019s more you\ncan buy all kinds of assets in auctions\nfrom firms that have gone into receiv-ership. There is rarely as good a time\nas now to be buying with the long term\nin mind.\nAnd once you\u2019ve got your idea, your\nfunding and your assets you need to\nface the market, which although tough,\nwon\u2019t be all doom and gloom. For one,\nthere\u2019s a global market like never before\nto sell your product - and even though\nit poorer than it used to be a year ago,\ndemand for basic, simple goods has\nnever been higher. So if you have a\ncheap method of capturing sunlight\nand using to turn water into steam,\nthen the world\u2019s your oyster. Have you\nfound out a way to make refrigerators\nrun off ambient heat? Then you\u2019ve got\na six billion-person market. Can you\nmake a cheap reusable water filter? Because if you can, you got it made.\nSo there you have it - you have an\namazing opportunity in your hands\nright now. With some vision, hard\nwork and luck you could become a\ncaptain of industry and your odds have\nnever looked better. And considering\nthat you\u2019re having trouble getting a\njob anyway, what have you got to lose?\nNothing.\nThe firms that\npioneered this\nnew era were\noften rookie\nfirms guided by\nyoung innovators\n6 felix Friday 20 March 2009\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of felix\nThe Rogue is less than happy with you ladies\n\u201cCulpability lies\nwith the desperate\nchaps whose\nlapdog attention\nfirst encouraged\nyour bloated egos\u201d\nI\ns anyone else somewhat abhorred by the egotistical behaviour of Imperial\u2019s womenfolk?\nRather than casting this article\naside, concluding it to be yet\nanother sexual frustration induced ha-rangue, consider my inference; simply\nnot possessing a train wreck for a visage or the body of an overweight preteen does not justify conducting yourself in a manner of nauseating disdain.\nThis is not some inflated oversimplified gender assessment; instead a commentary stimulated by the increasingly\nregular superciliousness one witnesses\nevery day.\nThe quintessence of Imperial, excellence in science etc, seems to have\nbeen substituted inadvertently for\nsome form of depressing competition\nfor the notice of the better looking females studying here, who behave with\na deplorable sense of self-importance.\nThis is particularly true for those girls\nwho are unacquainted with being perceived in this manner, who were perhaps bullied in high school and utterly\novershadowed by prettier, more confident girls. Now finding themselves in\nan establishment packed with the formerly tormented; they can flaunt their\nnew authority to an infuriating degree:\nPractical experiment: Assume you\nare the epitome of mediocrity. Saunter\ndown the walkway and subtly catch the\neye of the next obviously female stu-dent. One of two outcomes;\n1. She will walk straight past, nose\nin the air. This category of girl has\nbeen at Imperial far too long, and\nthe unremitting attention has rendered her with a delusional quantity\nof self-worth.\n2. She will glance at you for just\na little too long, and then embar-rassedly accelerate away. Slightly\nless conceited than our subject in result 1, but as a result self-disapprov-ing and annoyed that she isn\u2019t more\nof a bitch.\nDespite the fun you can have with\nwild generalisations, clearly this net of\ncriticism cannot be laid on every girl.\nAnd predictably, the root of culpability lies with the desperate chaps whose\nlapdog attention first encouraged these\nbloated egos.\nWhich reminds me; last week I observed a fairly appalling attempt to\npick up a girl, even by the standards we\nare accustomed to at the Union. Perching atop the large subwoofer in dB\u2019s,\nwith my partner in sneering voyeur-ism, we observed a collection of foolish miscreants making recurring and\nuncoordinated attempts to dance with\nthis moderately attractive/inebriated\nyoung woman, who appeared overwhelmingly aware of her contextual\npower. At last all but one remained,\nevidently the most hopeless of the lot.\nAs another person knocked into the\ngirl in question, our wretched remaining fool caught her and with a look of\nnauseatingly insincere concern on his\nuncivilized face, inquired \u2018Are you alright?\u2019, before proceeding to shove the\nother unaware individual with pointless aggression. You could almost hear\nhis mind computing; \u2018Perhaps I\u2019ll try a\ndifferent tact and go for the friend role,\ninsinuating others to be the perverts. If\nI appear comparatively less disgusting,\nshe may accidentally sleep with me!\u2019.\nExtraordinarily, this clever methodology was unsuccessful.\nThis story has no relevance to the\noriginal premise save to illustrate a\nperennial problem in the way men and\nwomen react to one another; which\nunfortunately is degenerated a shocking amount in this godforsaken estab-lishment. In other words, the general\nstereotypes of desperate adolescent\nmales and vaguely appealing, power\ntripping females is exaggerated beyond\nbelief \u2013 and spectating certain scenes\nof guy-girl interactions at Imperial is\nlike watching a tragic comedy, except\nno one has learnt their lines, and the\nmakeup artists are mentally defective.\nThe upshot is the inevitable nine times\nout of ten ; the girl subconsciously congratulates herself on the hollow fact\nthat someone wanted to copulate with\nher, while the abortive imbecile resigns\nhimself to a drinking game with his fellow disgruntled chums. My deduction\nis that students like our hopeless case\nin dB\u2019s only serve to make this divide\nbetween men and women at Imperial\nshoddier, by putting their immediate\nsuperficial desires before the potential of a meaningful platonic relation-ship. And as a result those females who\naren\u2019t follically challenged and have\nsomewhat symmetrical faces can justify the air of superiority they carry with\nthem. Bleak, but candid.\nUntil next time.\nI\nt is ironic being speechless and\ngoing on to write 800 words for\na Comment piece this week.\nHowever, I feel I need to write\nthis Comment piece. Not because I won the election for Felix Editor, but because I owe this to so many\npeople at Imperial.\nOver the last two weeks of soul-de-stroying campaigning for this position,\nI have learnt to appreciate the people\naround me and more so than I have\never in my life.\nI\u2019m not going to start listing names,\neven though I feel like I should do, but\nthere is one person to whom I am entirely grateful through all of this. As\nwe walk off into the sunset of these\nelections, and the credits start roll-ing, it is Kadhim who I owe most to.\nDespite the rivalry harboured through\nour contesting campaigns over the last\ntwo weeks, it has always been through\ncompetition I am proud to have bat-tled. Kadhim, who had a mere 65 votes\nless than me, would be an Editor Felix\nDan Wan discovers real friendships in victory\n\u201cAs we walk off\ninto the sunset,\nand the credits\nstart rolling, it is\nKadhim to whom I\nowe most.\u201d\nwould be proud to have at its helm.\nKadhim ran his campaign with the\nutmost integrity, and I can only thank\nhimforthat.Intheever-occurring\u2018heat\nof the moment\u2019 situations, we could\nhave very easily fallen out as friends\nduring the last two weeks. It would\nhave been the last thing I would have\nwanted, and scuppering my friendship\nwith him would truly not have been\nworth the editorial role in Felix.\nA new rule was announced this year\nthat allowed us to \u2018negative campaign\u2019\nagainst each other. It didn\u2019t need to\nbe spoken of that I trusted him not to\nattack me within his campaign, and\nvice versa. Anyway, his campaign was\nstrong enough alone without the need\nto negatively campaign against me. As\nthe last day of voting ticked over its\nmidnight deadline, I only felt a sense\nof massive relief that I didn\u2019t have to\ncompete against Kadhim\u2019s seemingly\nomnipresent campaign ever again.\nThroughout the two weeks, my\nperspective of him never wavered.\nThough rivals, it was never bitter. We\nspoke regularly about our campaigns,\nboth laughing as we explored the joys\nand stresses that walking around College with your own face on your chest\ncame with.\nBecoming next year\u2019s Felix Editor how-ever, is not only my own reward. It is also\nfor everyone that helped me during the\ncampaign fortnight. Not winning the elections would have been a massive shame\nto not only myself, but especially to those\nwho put so much effort into my cause. I\namjustgladtheynowgettocelebratetheir\nown success, and not just mine.\nMy friends proved themselves to be\nthe best friends I have ever known,\nand though I may be caught up in the\nemotion of winning the election, I truly\nmean it. I have reasoned with myself in\nthe event that I didn\u2019t win and I came\nto the following conclusion. I realised\nthat my friends helping me with my\ncampaign; the ones wearing my Tshirts, the ones giving up their spare\ntime to hand out flyers and sugary\nbribes, and the ones supporting me at\nhustings, really pulled out all the stops\nfor me. There were times started to\nquestion why I was actually running\nfor the position and times when I felt I\nwas one step behind other campaigns,\nbut they created a haven away from\nelections and College, where I could\nrelax and reassess. At times, their honesty seemed harsh, but I always knew it\nwas for my best interests. I\u2019m glad one\nof them had the balls to tell me, albeit\nquite tactfully, that my pre-lecture announcements were, compared to Kadhim\u2019s like watching a calves enter an\nabattoir.\nTo the people that approached me\nwith such enthusiasm about the election race highlighted a bigger issue that\nis only a benefit to Felix. The fact that\nKadhim, Zoe and I managed to rack up\na record total of 2,900 votes for the Felix Editor election alone, is testament\nto the excitement of the race. The important thing is that we managed to\nget so many more people interested in\nFelix and its outcome. That can only\nbenefit Felix and College life.\nBeyond people I know, I was honestly overwhelmed by people\u2019s willingness to listen to me as I interrupted\ntheir quiet pint at the Union to shove\na leaflet and sweet in their face. This\nComment piece seems the only way of\nreaching out to everyone that spoke\nto me, whether I knew you or not. I\nhave met so many people along the last\ntwo weeks that I am grateful for their\ntime. Though I initially hated talking to strangers, I came to enjoy the\nexperience. Campaigning gave me a\ngreat reason to approach anyone and\neveryone.\nI hope, as Felix Editor throughout\nnext year, I will be able to speak and listen to your opinions and ideas for Felix\njust as much I did during the last two\nweeks. I hope you will be just as receptive too, because as clich\u00e9 as it may\nsound, I want to bring the newspaper\nback to you, as the readers, the writers\nand the editors.\n\n"

On the\nSaturday, the men\u2019s team, comprising\nof Johnny Zhang, Jonas Morgenweg,\nJulio Jover, Alexandre, Alex Boury,\nMarc Sch\u00e4pert\u00f6ns, Zimuso Okoli, DoNine teams travel to Sheffield to take part\nin the BUCS Championships. felix sport\nreports back on their achievements\nmenico Corapi, Gonzalo de Gisbert,\nNicolas Vecchione and Marios Chartosias, played against the University of\nSouthampton.\nImperial won the first set quite comfortably and thought the opposition\nwould not be too hard a team to beat.\nSouthampton then improved as Imperial started to flake resulting in them\nlosing the second and third set. This\nturn of fortune for Imperial meant that\nthey had to find something extra to\nensure that the match went to a fifth\nset. After saving a match point in the\nfourth set, Imperial managed to win it\nand eventually went on to win the fifth\nset comfortably, winning the match\n3-2.\nOn Sunday they played Nottingham\nin the final, who had managed to beat\nMen\u2019s hockey win BUCS 2B divsion\nAfter a highly successful season the\nMen\u2019s 1st XI have capped it off with a\nfinal win away at Hertfordshire University. A stunning day was graced\nwith some glorious hockey from both\nsides but the class of IC was obvious\nduring the whole game even after intense pressure from the Hertfordshire\nforwards.\nThe short corner routines from IC\nwere performing well and an early goal\nfrom Koch left Hertfordshire stunned\nby the German\u2019s reactions. A second\ngoal soon followed, but by half time the\nscore was 2-1 after a rare mistake from\nthe Imperial backs.\nThe half time break was a welcome\nrelief for both sides after some scorching sun that was only matched by the\nhot IC team. Avtar the great provided\ninspiration and words of wisdom,\nwhich were followed by a classic emotional Cornish chat. The jaffa cakes\nwere an interesting choice as half time\nsnacks, but substituted well for the\nlack of water available in the county of\nHertfordshire region.\nThe second half saw IC put everything into the match and with an early\ngoal the result of the game was clear.\nClassic performances all round, especially from the experienced heads of\nTunnicliffe Senior, Connick, O\u2019Reilly\nand Cornish.\nThe team would like to thanks both\nAvtar (coach) and Mark (president) for\nattending the league winning match,\nand hope that they both enjoyed the\nChampagne hockey.\nThe team now have a promotion\nplayoff next week against Reading,\nwinners of the 2A division. Celebrations of their two league topping performances have already commenced\nhowever, with the mighty men\u2019s 1s out\nin force at the ACC bar night and they\nwill be in good voice this evening to let\nthe whole world know who we are.\nThe club also wishes the Ladies 1st\nXI the best of luck for their BUCS Cup\nFinal next week.

Consequently the Foreign Office is expected to propose before the\nUK Parliament, a plan to suspend the islands\u2019 constitution, transferring\nall power from the elected assembly and cabinet to the governor Gordon\nWetherell. But Mr Misick has hit back, calling the UK\u2019s \u201cdraconian\u201d plans to\noust him \u201cmodern day colonialism.\u201d\nThe two Caribbean islands, which attract visitors both as a tourist destination and offshore financial hub, are one of 14 British Overseas Territories\nmeaning they are autonomous parts of the United Kingdom.\nBritain\nLibrary Cafe to extend\nopening hours during the\nupcoming revision period\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nImperial College Commercial Services\ndepartment are to extend the opening\nhours of the library cafe during the revision period. This is the first time that\nthe new, fully refurbished library will\nbe open during the exam period since\nit opened last summer.\nThousands of students descend upon\nthe library in the months building up\nto their exams in the summer term,\nwith a large number of students often\nmoving into the various floors.\nAt the moment, the library is open 24\nhours a day, seven days a week, apart\nfrom a small period between 21:00 on\nFriday and 10:00 on Saturday when\nthere is a thorough clean of the library.\nThe newly refurbished Library Cafe will be open for longer during the Easter holidays\nService hours in the Library Cafe,\nwhich is located on the ground floor,\nare from 08:00 until 23:00 Monday to\nFriday and at the weekend it closes at\n18:00. The space is available throughout the library\u2019s 24 hour opening period with a vending facility. Since there\nwill undoubtedly be a high number of\nstudents in the library over the next\nfew weeks, Commercial Service are\nconsidering pushing back the closing\ntime at weekends from 18:00 to 23:00\nto match the times during the rest of\nthe week. During the revision period,\nthe Library Cafe will also become a self\nclearing area in order to minimise the\namount of litter accumulated.\nThe Library will also be open during\nthe College Easter holidays but will be\nclosed during the Easter Bank Holiday\nweekend.\nThe cafe now has a new exciting\nmenu of hot and cold snacks, including\nHot Wrapid Wraps, soups, salads and\nsandwiches, as well as a range of muffins with a barista coffee.\nThe combination of caffeine and food\nis considered, by some students, to be a\nvital ingredient to surviving the strenuous revision period, with one student\ntelling felix that \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer for\nthem. The benefits of having the cafe\nopen for longer would be huge!\u201d\nSteven Salter, from the College Catering Department, told felix that \u201cWe\nare looking forward to welcoming Imperial Students over the Spring Break,\nand hope our later closing time of 23:00\nat the weekend will make the revision\nperiod a less stressful one.\u201d\nAnd finally: Medical student\nloses out on ITV show\nDina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nImperial College medical student,\nSumera Shahaney, lost out on \u00a375, 000\nwhen she appeared as a contestant on\nITV game show \u2018The Colour of Money\u2019 over the weekend. The show, which\nis hosted by Chris Tarrant, has been\nbilled as \u201cthe most stressful game on\ntelevision\u201d in which contestants can either win a life changing sum of money,\nor nothing at all.\nIncase you have never watched the\nshow before, its format is effectively a\nblend of Deal Or No Deal and bomb\ndefusal involving cash machines. Players pick a machine (each differentiated\nby a different \u201ccolour\u201d, hence the title)\nand stand staring at the screen while a\ncash figure steadily rises. The trick is to\nshout \u201cstop!\u201d before the machine hits\nits total and \u201clocks you out\u201d. Since how\nmuch cash the machine contains is\nunknown, this means balancing greed\nagainst nerve. Contestants must hold\nout for as long as possible to withdraw\nthe greatest amount of money. To increase the tension, and indeed confu-sion, each contestant has to do this 10\ntimes, without getting locked down, to\nreach a set target.\nThe IC medic unfortunately did not\nmanage to take home any cash which\nshe had told Mr Tarrant would fund her\nmedical studies and pay for her wed-ding. However, Sumera hadn\u2019t actually\nbeen proposed to by her boyfriend of\nseven years, who was also in the audience on the day: \u201cI think it came as a\nbit of a surprise to my boyfriend, but\nthankfully, we had spoken about marriage before!\u201d\nAlthough Sumera returned home\nempty handed, she said she was delighted with the experience neverthe-less. \u201cI had a great time and I met some\nlovely people on the show- Chris Tarrant was adorable.

But the decision has defused tensions, and led\nto the main opposition party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz to call off a\nmajor rally in the capital Islamabad. When ex-President Pervez Musharraf\nresigned in August 2008 the two parties worked together, but since then\ntheir relationship has deteriorated.\nHowever the Taleban\u2019s militant\nactivity on the border with Afghanistan, including a suicide bomb which\nkilled 12 Pakistanis at a bus station\non Monday 16th March, continue to\ndestabilise regional politics.\nPakistan\nOver the past week, a coup has unfolded in the island nation of\nMadagascar.\nDuring February there was a massacre of over a hundred people when tensions flared between supporters of the opposition party, led by Andry Rajoelina, and those loyal to the democratically elected President Ravalomanana.\nThings have developed considerably since then. Indeed, Rajoelina, a 34-year-old former DJ, has used his supporters and mutineers from the army to invade the presidential palace, and declare himself as the new President.\nThe citizens of Madagascar are relieved\nthe power struggle has ended without\nfurther bloodshed, but pro-democracy\nobservers have condemned Mr. Rajoelina\u2019s resort to the use of force to evict\nthe current government, instead of waiting until the next elections in two years\ntime.

Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has\nwithdrawn from parliament treaties committing the country to the United\nStates\u2019 missile defence shield. The Czech Prime Minister said this was only a\ntemporary measure, and the ratification process could be revived at any time.\nNevertheless, this is sure to put a smile on faces back in the Kremlin.\nRussia\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFriday 20 March 2009 felix\nArts\nI\nfeel as though I have neglected\nculture and the arts these last 6\nweeks. The majority of second\nyear and the first term of my\nfinal year flew by as my weeks\nwere spent attending at least two cultural \u2018happenings\u2019 a week, writing\ncomment pieces for felix and attending lectures, lab and what have you in\nbetween.\nI have my time management skills\nand seemingly unending energy to\nthank for that. Today I tell an antithetical story. This term my nun avatar has\nbarely made it into the introductory\npages of the comment section and my\nreviews grow sparser with each passing week.\nFinal year sucks. Not only do I fear\nan impending nervous breakdown daily on account of just how much needs\nto be achieved before the last week of\nApril when my finals commence, but I\nfear for the psychological welfare of my\nboyfriend, closest friends and family as\nthey double as emotional punch-bags.\nBefore I continue further and turn you\ndevoted Arts readers into one too, I\nwill just say that my pitiful lack of contribution is due to a temporary acceptance that I need to put things on hold\nuntil my exams are over. Come May 1st\nand I am all felix\u2019s once more.\nNot only has the work load stopped\nmy opportunity to write but it has also\nmeant I was not able to attend a play\nI have been looking forward to since\nearly October. Madame de Sade features Dame Judi Dench and bond girl\nRosamund Pike and is next up in the\nDonwar West End\u2019s superb line up\n(Hamlet with Jude Law follows next).\nIn my stead \u2026.. has stepped in and reviewed it. I am extremely grateful and\nonly a little bit bitter.\nEven worse than missing out on\nplays, the work load has prevented me\nfrom reading all those novels on my\nTo Read list. As a wee girl of 12 or so I\nused to consume novels at an alarming\nrate. Alex Garlands grizzly Thailand as\nconjured up in his book The Beach was\nread, digested and accepted with its\nthemes of an adult nature never eliciting even a bat eyelid. Come puberty\nand my reading seemed to go down as\nmy acne soared, but since my summer\n(and coincidental visit to the land of\nGarland\u2019s novel) I have made an effort\nto up my fitness, as it were, and start\nreading regularly again. Since New\nYear\u2019s I have read six novels which I\nconsider no small feat.\nSo, in a last effort to exercise my\npowers as critique before I go under I\nwill whiz through a select few trying to\ncapture them in a nutshell.\nMr Nice should really be a student\nstaple for its easy going narrative from\ncharismatic author, Howard Marks\n(Oxford graduated physicist no less),\nwho writes his autobiography following 6 years spent in prison after finally\nbeing caught 20 years after beginning\nhis career as one of the world\u2019s largest\nhashish dealers. Adventure awaits.\nOnTheRoadbybeatnikJackKerouac\ndoesn\u2019t need much of an introduction\nonly to say that it will whisk you across\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nAmerica and back four times on mo-torbikes, buses, open top trucks and in\nbeat up Cadillacs. Might be an appropriate antidote to feelings of claustrophobia brought on by revision.\nDune by Frank Herbert converted\nme from sci-fi cynic to lover thereof in\nthe time it took me to read this hefty\nnovel (1 week: how\u2019s that for an en-dorsement. In fact, the transition may\nhave taken within the first fifty pages.)\nThis novel will excite anyone with an\ninterest in physics, biology, politics,\nreligion, poetry, action, travel, science-fiction (duh) and even throws in some\nsoppy romantic shizzle. Please, please\ndo read.\nThe Life of Ivan Denisovich by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn takes you through\none grueling day in one of Stalin\u2019 gulags (labour camps) through the eyes\nof Shcha-845 (Ivan) as we live through\nevery bite of frost, sharp wind and\nsanction enforced by the warders. An\noutstanding, easy 150-page read.\nArts this week is also a short, easy one\nwith some more architecture reviewed\nby David Paw, as well as the previously\nmentioned Madame de Sade review.\nHowever, for now I must desist with\nculture and persist with fact! Enjoy\nyour Easter \u2018holidays\u2019.\nBooks, bondage\nand buildings\nWhat to do if your\ndaughter marries the\nking of Sadism\nW\ne all know that\nMonet\u2019s \u2018Water Lily\nPond\u2019 is pretty. It\u2019s\na great piece of art\nand we all like to\nlook at it, but I implore anyone to look\nat it for 1 hour 45 minutes without an\ninterval and not begin to tire a little of\nthose sweet pastel hues. This is rather\nhow I considered the latest instalment of Michael Grandage\u2019s \u2018Donmar\nWest End\u2019 residency at the Wyndham\u2019s\nTheatre.\nMadame de Sade is about the wife of\nthe Marquis de Sade (Rosamond Pike)\nher mother (Judi Dench) and several\nother women who know the infamous\nFrench aristocrat from whom the word\n\u2018sadism\u2019 originated.\nWhilst the set looks almost edible and\nthe costumes are stunning, annoyingly\nthey only serve to enhance the overwhelming sense that the audience is\npeaking into a dolls\u2019 house. The prox-emics are static and the actors literally\nRosie Milton prepares to be impressed by an all star cast and\ndirector but is left disappointed.\nfade into the set like wooden dolls until\nthey are as much a part of the furniture\nas the wooden chairs delicately placed\naround the stage.\nFrances Barber\u2019s wickedly carnal\nComtesse De Saint-Fond steels the production from the moment the curtain\nrises. Her impressive use of the riding\ncrop cracks some much needed energy\ninto the production and this is only Act\nI. While Rosamond Pike is well cast as\nDe Sade\u2019s devotedly masochistic wife\nher rabbit-caught-in-headlights char-acterisation in the first Act makes it a\nhard to believe the reports in the second Act that during an orgy with her\nhusband and a group of yokels she had\nquite literally been swinging from the\nrafters while a peasant boy licked her\nnaked body.\nJudi Dench makes a fine Madame de\nMontreuil obsessed with keeping her\nfamily name in honour while Fiona\nButton\u2019s Anne provides some welcome light relief as Dench\u2019s frivolous\nyounger daughter, the personification\nof feminine guilelessness. However,\nall the actors seem swamped by the\nshear wordiness of the 40 year-old\ntranslation.\nAs an incurably nosy gossip, I am surprised that the play fails to solicit nearly the amount of interest and intrigue\nthat such fruity subject matter warrants and this is perhaps because the\ndirection lacks momentum. If you\u2019re\nhappy to zone out for 110 minutes and\nwatch a group of very pretty woman\nin gorgeous dresses sashay around the\nstage like bon bon\u2019s in an ornate rococo\nbox then Madame de Sade is worth a\nwatch, however, with credentials like\nGrandage\u2019s I don\u2019t think an audience\ncan be blamed for expecting a little\nmore.\nMadame de Sade is on at the\nWyndham\u2019s theatre until May 23\n2009\nHe is to architecture what Hendrix\nis to the guitar: Andrea Palladio\nThe don of architecture is very much hard done by as the Royal Academy\u2019s attempt to pay homage to the\ngreat Palladio. David Paw tells us more.\nW\nhen I started out\nlearning to play gui-tar, I hacked it up\nlike any other be-ginner. I would buy\nguitar magazines (Guitar Techniques\nand Guitar for the Practicing Musician\n- was there any point buying anything\nelse?) and wallow in the rich soup of\nmusical knowledge in their pages, trying to soak as much of it up as I could.\nI absorbed mainly anything and everything about my favourite players - Eddie Van Halen, Satriani, Jason Becker\n- while maintaining a neutral outlook\non the other genres. Outside of my\nlimited area of knowledge, the world\nof guitar and music was an incredibly\ndaunting place, and basic priorities\nlike memorising the chord chart were\ndifficult enough, much less navigating\ninsane jazz progressions.\nI always reached a sticking point\nwhen it came to the greats, though.\nMy 10-year old self genuinely could\nnot understand for years why Hendrix and Clapton were so revered. In\nmy eyes back then, I equated being\nable to \u201cplay\u201d with technical ability,\nand naively this was how I gauged a\nmusician\u2019s merit, much less paying attention to things like tone, personal\nstyle, innovation etc. Jimi couldn\u2019t play\na million miles an hour. What was the\npoint? I just didn\u2019t buy it. Later I would\nwatch interviews of my favourite players speaking about Hendrix et al. with\nincredible reverence and though I still\ndidn\u2019t believe the hype, I began to accept the inevitable. Without the reassurance of my heroes, it would have\ntaken me a lot longer to see the light.\nIt is 3.50 on a glorious Saturday afternoon and instead of being outside\nin the sunshine, I am packed inside the\nRoyal Academy in the space the size of\na Hobbit\u2019s broom cupboard along with\na collection of bored partners, their\nenthusiastic yet confused girlfriends\n(at least Topshop provides sofas), tourists and pushy middle class pensioners who probably look at Stephen Fry\nthe same way Mrs Robinson looked at\nDustin Hoffman. In the words of a very\nunderrated liquor clerk in Superbad,\nfuck my life. I have been trying to make\nmy way through the crowd while doing\njustice to the subject of the exhibition\n- reputedly the greatest architect of\nall time - while also trying to comprehend why this title had been bestowed\nupon him. His name is Palladio, and he\nwouldn\u2019t be happy if he were here.\nThe problem with Andrea Palladio :\nHis Life and Legacy has nothing to do\nwith undeserved reputations and hype.\nI fully trust that the curators know\nwhat they\u2019re talking about. The problem with this particular arrangement\nof architectural models, plan drawings,\ncontextual tidbits and memoirs is that\nthough the parts may be there, they feel\nless than their potential sum, largely in\npart to a dramatic in failure of communication from the organisers to their\naudience. I am somewhat sceptical in\nbelieving that the majority of people\nwho were present with me that afternoon were there specifically to tickle\ntheir fancy for 16th century Northern\nItalian architecture. The room is split\nup into several rooms, with the gross\ntrend being that as a whole, each is better than the last. This is also valid when\npondering the choice between staying\nin the well-lit and spacious lobby and\ndescending into the first room.\nThe first room attempts to set the\ncontext of our subject\u2019s achievements.\nMay I take this opportunity to stress\nthe word \u201cattempt\u201d. The first room is a\nbedlam of spatial and physical incoherence that fails to excite. If this were the\nDivine Comedy, the first room would\nbe the dullness of Purgatorio and Paradiso condensed into 400 square metres\nof plan drawings and minor details that\nonlythededicatedfollowerofthearchi-tect would have any genuine interest in.\nThere is one breathtaking scale model\nof the Basilica in Vicenza, and staring\ninto its massive hallways and corridors\nit is easy to get a sense of scale of what\nhe achieved upon its completion. But\nother than that, as important as context may be, a good proportion of it felt\ntedious and relatively indulgent given\nthe limited amount of space the exhibition had. Paintings from the area try\nto set the tone of the figures involved,\nthe world of the architect and the construction site during that era, but it still\nfeels tenuous. Ornaments and artifacts\nfrom the era are dotted around the\nroom to try to give the viewer a flavour\nof the time period. It feels like a GCSE\nArt and Design student trying to argue\nthat the painting they plucked arbitrarily from Google images has plenty to\ndo with their final piece.\nOh, we do get a sense of his beginnings as a collaborator with more\nwell-known architects of the era. For\nexample, a segment focuses on a joint\nproject with the great architect Giulio\nRomano on the Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza. The details of the project are\nintriguing and the progression rewarding when followed to the end, and as\na bonus we are even rewarded with\na portrait of Romano by none other\nthan Titian. But it is difficult to feel any\ngenuine excitement without physical\nillustration, and by physical illustration I mean models. Architecture is a\nphysical, visual language that requires\nthe viewer to not only see and imagine\nthe finished project and its interaction\nwith its surroundings, but to obtain a\npalpable feel of its scale and physicali-ty. The plan drawings and photographs\nnever allow you to really get involved\nwith the building and space itself, and\nparts of the exhibition suffer noticeably for that.\nThe second room is better. Larger,\nquieter and with less packed into the\nspace, it offers a greater quality of\ndepth and contemplation as far as getting under the skin of the buildings is\nconcerned. It is difficult not to notice\nthe large scale models of the Villa Emo\nand Barbaro with their imposing tri-partate facades, and with the greater\nfreedom allowed to the gallerygoer, it is\ncertainly more of a pleasure to peruse.\nRooms three and four focuse on the\nemergence of the then newly-coined\n\u201cNeo Palladianism\u201d and its influence\non subsequent generations, and the\npublishing of perhaps Palladio\u2019s greatest work in any sense, his influential\ncompendium of reflections on the\nprofessional and idealistic aspects of\narchitecture, the Quattro Libri. One\ncould consider them a giant tome of\nsorts spread over four volumes, with\nthe thoroughness of Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\nthe vision of Delirious New York and\nthe epic scale of The Bible.\nThis is where we reach the crux of\nthe exhibition. We are meant to be\nwitnessing a tribute and exploration\nof one of the greatest creators and\ndesign influencers of all time, but we\nnever reach a point of awe or complete\nunderstanding of his greatness until\nthe very end. At the outset we are told\nhis designs for the country house out\nin Italy were greatly influential from\nthe European mainland to Britain to\na point at which the British country\nhouse can trace direct lineage to Palladio\u2019s initial work. A little later on we\nlearn of the influence of the Quattro\nLibri in subsequent generations over\ncenturies of architectural history. But\nwe\u2019re heathens. We\u2019re too used to giant skyscrapers born of oil riches and\ndifficult concept buildings, too used to\nbrash visual statements and the new\nstandard of physical grandeur. We need\njust a little more convincing. Some\nreassurance, perhaps. So his achievements never really hit home until we\nwatch videos and interviews of today\u2019s\narchitects speaking in reverential tones\nabout the great man himself.\nHe was a starchitect before they even\nexisted. The Palladian influence is so\ngreat that it has become subsumed\ninto modern architecture not just in\na practical and technical sense but in\na philosophical sense that the ethos\nof the modern architect owes no little debt to his ideas. A teenager sitting\nin his room playing his guitar would\ntake the feedback and distortion and\nscreaming lead tones for granted, but\nhe would owe it to Hendrix who had\nbrought all of these ideas to the fore\nand made them art forms. Just as\nmuch, the vocabulary and ideology\nof modern architecture owes a debt\nto Palladio\u2019s ideas, a man who, in the\nwords of the Japanese architect Arata\nIsosaki, \u201ccould reach the real essence of\narchitecture\u201d.\nUntil 13th April at the Royal\nAcademy, Piccadilly\nSan Giorgio Church in Venice.

Testing for it is quick, easy, free and painless. So why haven\u2019t you\ngot round to doing it yet?\nAre you carrying it?\nChlamydia is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the\nUK. One in ten people aged under 25\nwho are tested for it, have it . Despite\nhigh infection rates, a recent survey of\nunder 25s in Westminster, Kensington\nand Chelsea and Hammersmith and\nFulham showed that 79% have never\nbeen tested for chlamydia.\nWHAT IS CHLAMYDIA\nChlamydia is passed on through penetrative vaginal or anal sex, oral sex, or\nthrough sharing sex toys with someone\nwho has it.\nChlamydia often does not have any\nsymptoms, which means that you or\nyour partner could have it and not\nknow about it. In fact, around 75% of\nwomen and 50% of men with chlamydia have no symptoms at all .\nAlthough you may have no symp-toms, the signs to watch out for are\nunusual discharge or more frequent or\npainful urination. Women may notice\npain or bleeding during sex, bleeding\nbetween periods, irregular periods or\nlower abdominal pain. Men might suffer from irritation at the tip of the penis or painful swelling of the testicles.\nWHY SHOULD I GET TESTED?\nIf you have chlamydia and leave it untreated it can cause serious, lasting\ndamagetoyouroryourpartner\u2019shealth.\nThe infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy\nand result in both men and women not\nbeing able to have children.\nHowever, chlamydia is both easily\ntested for and treated. For both men\nand women, the test is just a urine\nsample and treatment will usually just\nbe one dose of antibiotics.\nHOW CAN YOU GET TESTED?\nTesting is free and confidential. You\ncan get tested by:\n\u2022Visiting your GP and asking to be\ntested- this is now available at Imperial\nCollege Health Centre\n\u2022Calling Westside Contraceptive\nServices on 020 8962 4454 to book an\nappointment to get tested\n\u2022Visiting www.check-kit.org.uk to\norder a free test kit\n\u2022 Visiting one of the outreach stalls\norganised by Brook London or the Terrence Higgins Trust on campus.\nFor more information see below.\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\nOnce you have been tested, you can\nthen choose whether to get your results by phone, text or post. If positive\nyou will then be advised on where to\ncollect your antibiotics which will clear\nthe infection.\nHow can you get\nchecked at Imperial?\nHe probably won\u2019t be wearing these pants...\nDealing with exam stress\nEXAM STRESS\nExam stress affects us all at some time\nor another. There are few people who\ngo into the exams at the end of the year\nwithout being nervous. It\u2019s a normal\nphysiological reaction to being in a\nstressful situation. Flight or fight. Exams are designed to stretch us, to differentiate between the good and the\nless good students (or at Imperial the\nextremely good and the very good) and\nare inherently stressful, no matter what\nthe examiners say.\nFor some people, the reaction to exams is extreme. The prospect of being assessed, being compared to other\nstudents and being judged provokes\nsuch an intense emotional and physical response that they simply cannot\nperform at all, let alone to the best of\ntheir ability. Worries might start early\nin the year, revision be impossible, or\nphysical symptoms prevent the student\nfrom entering the exam hall.\nLEARN TO LEARN\nSome people, some lucky people, can\nuse their nervous energy in a positive\nway. They find the butterflies in their\nstomach exciting and motivating. They\ncan revise more effectively, seem calm\nand still have time to go the gym. Of\ncourse, they are much more likely to do\nthemselves justice in an exam, and yes,\nthey usually get better results. They are\nnot superhuman, but they have learnt\nskills and adopted attitudes which help\nthem. We can all do the same. We academics might all benefit from developing our learning and assessment skills\nas much as we do our knowledge.\nAnd we all already have, to some\nextent. Whatever you feel, Imperial\nCollege students are good at being as-sessed, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have\nmade it this far. But the transfer to\nuniversity is a difficult one, and the big\nfish in a suddenly-very-much-bigger-pond phenomenon is a very real challenge for the majority students at Imperial. It is so easy to loose sight of the\nfact that even those students who get\nthirds have earned their place in what\nmy headmistress used to call \u201cthe upper echelons of intelligencia\u201d.\nIN TRAINING\nYou would expect an athlete to train\nhard, but you would expect them to\nhave dinner every night. You would\nimagine that a pianist would put the\nhours in to perfect Rach III for their\nfinals, but you would also expect them\nto sleep. This isn\u2019t Shine. So why, oh\nwhy do students try to concentrate on\ntheir work for 18hours a day?\nWork life balance is incredibly im-portant. No matter how strong the\ntemptation, don\u2019t ditch your society\nfor the library. You need time to relax\nand forget work, so extracurricular\nactivities are even more important in\nthe exam term. Revising can be boring and tiring, so dedicate time to\nactivities which given you a sense of\nachievement.\nLook after yourself. To perform well\nyou have to be well, so do not neglect\nyour physical health. Make sure you eat\nthree balanced meals a day. Time spent\non eating regularly and healthily is far\nmore valuable than the extra 30mins\nyou save by not going shopping.\nMoodalteringdrugsonlymakethings\nworse. Alcohol can help you relax but\nbe careful it doesn\u2019t progress into an\neasy but counterproductive solution\nto that sleeping problem. Caffeine can\nhelp you wake up, but can keep you\nawake for 12 hours. Both disrupt the\nbody\u2019s natural day/night pattern and\nsleep quality, energy levels and ultimately productivity, are all impaired.\nPerformance enhancing drugs are becoming increasingly more common in\nthe UK, but there is plenty of evidence\nagainst their use in the general population and the guidance is clear: do not\nuse them unless they are prescribed to\nyou by your doctor.\nSLEEP HYGIENE\nNot sleeping well can be a really big\nproblem. Insomnia is often the first\nsymptom of stress and worry. Most\npeople suffer with it at some point, and\nmost students notice a change in their\nenergy levels at College, particularly in\nexam term.\nUnfortunately most students are\nalso inadvertently making the situation worse. In particular there is the\ntemptation to try to work into the late\nevening. Although you might feel more\nawake then, work at this time is barely\nproductive. Importantly, you cannot\nexpect to go straight from hard concentration to good sleep, so make sure\nyou put time aside to relax before going to bed.\nBe firm with yourself about working\nin the day and at least be trying to sleep\nat night. You are in training, so remember that even one late night can leave\nyou jet-lagged for days.\nYou can find our more about sleep\nproblems and sleep hygiene at http://\nwww.patient.co.uk/pdf/pilsL835.pdf\nWHERE TO FIND OUT MORE\nThere is plenty of information out\nthere about how exam stress can affect you, how to help avoid it being a\nproblem and even how to use it to your\nadvantage. There are many different\npsychological models, and a variety\nof techniques and tricks which can be\nhelpful. You can find out more at www.\nimperialcollegehealthcentre.co.uk\nIf you think you have a disabling\nproblem with exam stress it is usually\nworth investing the time, sooner rather\nthan later, in dealing with this rather\nthan bury yourself in more and more\nwork. It would do far more for your re-sult. The doctors at the Health Centre\nwould be happy to see any student who\nfeels he/she has a problem, as would\nyour personal tutor. Alternatively the\nStudent Counselling Service (http://\nwww3.imperial.ac.uk/counselling) offer free confidential counselling to any\nregistered student of Imperial College.\nThe Health Centre also runs workshops on exam stress. These are free\nand open to all. You do not need to have\nseen a doctor first. Spaces are limited\nand need to be booked in advance, and\nthere is some preparatory work to be\ndone. The workshops are about some\nof the cognitive theories on stress and\nhow to deal with it; please be clear that\nthey are not about the tools and techniques of how to study, revise and take\nexams. Find out more at www.imperi-alcollegehealthcentre.co.uk\nDr David Hayton\nSalaried GP\nTop Tip I\nThere is plenty of research that\nshows our concentration can\nlast 40-50minutes at most. Have\nbreaks (7-10mins) every 50mins\nof studying. Use this to relax\ndon\u2019t spend it on the phone or\nplanning your revision.\nTop Tip II\nThe secondary education\nsystem knows how to help students learn. Run your day like\na school day. Get up early at a\nregular time. Have breakfast.\nWork for short periods with regular breaks and proper meals.\nDo something relaxing in the\nevening, and go to bed on time.\nTop Tip III\nThink about having a regular\narrangement with your friends\nto spend an hour together at the\nend of each day.
