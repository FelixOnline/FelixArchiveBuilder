One way to do this is to temporarily\nchange your computer\u2019s MAC address to that\nof your console and then register the MAC in\nthe normal way using your web browser. Please\nnote that is probably against College ICT policy and therefore I am too much of a pussy to\nactually recommend you do this.\nFirst, you\u2019d need to work out the MAC address of your console. Connect your console to\nany networking port on your computer or laptop and wait for it to aquire an address. Then,\non Windows, open Network Connections and\nthen the Status window for the port to which\nyou connected the console, and click Details.\nThe \u2018Physical Address\u2019 is the code you are\nlooking for, and once you have it download\nthe free MacMakeup tool from http://tinyurl.\ncom/6b7b6. Follow the instructions on that site\nto change the MAC address of your Internet\nconnection to the one of your console, and then\nproceed with registration in the normal way.\nBoom, you\u2019re done! Don\u2019t forget to change the\nMAC back after, though! Again, this might be\nagainst College policy and so you do it at your\nown risk.\nOne even more illegal method would be just\nto use a router or share your computer\u2019s internet connection, but this is even more explicitly\nagainst College policy so I shouldn\u2019t even mention it. Oops, did I say that out loud?\nSo now you\u2019re online, all that remains is to\nload up your favourite game and blast away to\nyour heart\u2019s content. Enjoy!\n22\nGAMES\nFRIDAY 01 OCTOBER 2010\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless specifically mentioned\nto the contary you\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash\nPlayer plug-in which can be installed from http://get.\nadobe.com/flashplayer/.\nDino Run\npixeljam.com/dinorun\nChat Noir\nIn this 8-bit sidescroller, you control a tiny dinosaur\ntrying to outrun and survive the oncoming apoca-lypse. Doomed stegosauruses, tar pits and smouldering craters block the path to freedom while eggs\nand even smaller critters provide tempting diversions\nfor extra points. The adrenaline really kicks in, howev-er, when you get too far behind and the screen starts\nto flash red and black as a torrent of rocks and fire\nthreatens to consume your unlucky dino.\nEven if you\u2019ve played the game before, it\u2019s worth revisiting it again for the new multiplayer mode that\nallows racing up to four other players online. This\nmode adds a strong competitive element that heightens the intensity of this already exciting game.\nThe concept is deceptively simple: click the big dots\nto block the cat and stop it escaping off the screen.\nIn reality though you will rarely taste success as the\ntitular character dodges your attempts to surround it\nand disappears off the screen with a smug pattering\nof paws. To say this game is addictive is be an under-statement, as after the first few frustrating failures\nyour one and only goal in life becomes to beat that\ndamn cat no matter what it takes. Victory is sweet\nthough despite the anti-climax the game gives you,\nso don\u2019t let me put you off!\nJust arrived and already\nbored? Time to get online!\nOur easy guide to getting your console on College internet\nSimon Worthington\nYou\u2019ve arrived at your new university and\nyou\u2019re already stressed out. You\u2019ve got to\ncope with Welcome Week events, meeting\nnew people and the challenge of moving into\nyour new halls, and what you really need is a\nquick game of Modern Halo Call Of Warfare 2\nStrike Deluxe to take the edge off! But, disas-ter! You can\u2019t even connect to the lobby! How\nare you ever going to survive the year? Never\nfear Imperial noobs, for with our step-by-tiny-step guide you will have your console of choice\nonline and ready to rock in no time.\nThe first step is to understand the hoops you\nneed to jump through in order to get yourself\nconnected. Imperial internet is some of the fastest around, but in order to use it your device\nmust be registered in the College systems. Registration is based on the MAC address of your\ndevice, which is a unique code that identifies\nyour console or computer from all the others.\nThe registration process ties this number to\nyour College username, so College can provide\nand log access. So, all you need to do to get\nonline is to register your MAC address. Easy!\nWell, nearly. Registration happens when you\nfirst try and browse to a web page, and is done\nthrough your browser. So for consoles with a\nweb browser function the easiest way to perform registration is with the console itself.\nHowever, this is a problem for consoles and\nother devices lacking a web browser function\nas the registration page will never be reached.\nOne solution is to get Imperial\u2019s ICT service\nto register your console for you. You can find\nall the information online at imperial.ac.uk/ict,\nand if you use the generic request form there is\nan option for \u201cregistering a device or computer\nfor network access\u201d. If you do take this route\nyou\u2019ll need to provide information about which\nnetwork port your console is plugged into, your\ncollege username and CID and possibly anything else the technicians would like to know.\nWhile this is by far the recommended solu-tion, it can take some time especially during\nthe start of term when lots of new things need\nsetting up and configuring, and for some reason registering games consoles doesn\u2019t seem\nThis is actually how the Internet works.\nHave your say on this article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nFour new games to get hot for\nBatman: Arkham City\nRelease Date: 2011\nFor: PS3, Xbox 360, PC\nPortal 2\nRelease Date: Feb 9, 2011\nFor: PS3, Xbox 360, PC, Mac\nProfessor Layton and the\nUnwound Future\nRelease Date: Oct 22,\n2010.

You\u2019re reading this\nFreshers\u2019 copy, most\nlikely picked up off the\nfloor of your room in\nhalls, and you\u2019re very nearly there.\nYou\u2019ve spent the last few months being\ntold that your exams were too easy, your\nfuture is jobless, your university fees\nhigher than ever, your hair too long and\nyour generation\u2019s romantic comedies\ntoo full of Gerard Butler. Most of these\nthings are not true. Gerard Butler does\nappear to be able to star in several movies simultaneously, however.\nThe good news is this - you can forget\nthat now. Those people are behind you -confined to your old secondary school,\nbitter tabloid newsrooms and your\nhometown. You\u2019re now a free agent, a\nuniversity student with the power to be\nwho you want, say what you want, and\nclaim to have done things in your gap\nyear that are physically impossible or\notherwise massively unfeasible. Don\u2019t\nbe the guy who claims to have taught\nmodern dance to underprivileged kids in\nBrazil. Don\u2019t be him.\nThe bad news is that, as Spiderman\ntaught us, with great power comes a proportionally higher number of dickheads.\nIf there\u2019s one thing Imperial excels at,\nit\u2019s dickheads per student, and as Freshers here you\u2019ll find that your year bears\nthe brunt of most of them. You\u2019ll see the\nrich fashionistas who flinch every time\nthey come into contact with someone\npoor enough to need a student loan;\nyou\u2019ll be treated to the business plans\nof a dozen Financial Times-reading ar-seholes, whilst struggling to breathe under the torrent of disdain being poured\nall over you; you will encounter the\nendless borderline-insane student politicians and activists who want to change\nthe world by shouting loudly at it; and\nyou will of course have to put up with\nthe weekly opinions of the sort of self-aggrandising lunatics who hide behind\npseudonyms and write for student news-papers. Cocks.\nIf I\u2019ve accidentally labelled you in that\nlist and you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable\nnow, well, so am I. Don\u2019t worry about\nit. If you\u2019re not on that list but are getting apprehensive about the prospects of\nspending the next three years with the\npeople on it, then that\u2019s good.You should\nbe. There\u2019s a lot of talk about how great\na new beginning this is for you, and how\nyou can be who you want to be, cast off\nthe insulting nicknames that insinuate\nvarious sex acts with domestic animals,\nand reinvent yourself as a new person.\nUnfortunately, if you were the kind of\nperson who naturally attracted that sort\nof nickname, then don\u2019t expect to stay\nMister Definitely-Doesn\u2019t-Shag-Goats\nvery long. Here\u2019s a sad truth - university\ndoesn\u2019t change most people. Particularly the nickname-inventors.\nBut it can change you. Now there\u2019s\nan idea. You can realise that you\u2019re surrounded by one of the most fantastic\ncities in the world, full of real people.\nPeople who aren\u2019t interested in your\nChange is overrated\nprivate life, or your childhood spent on\nfarms. You can realise that, whilst the\npercentage of arseholes has remained\nabout constant, the number of people\nyou\u2019re studying with has increased ten-fold. Look in the right places, and you\u2019ll\nfind the people you want to be around.\nSo here\u2019s your Freshers\u2019 Week advice\nfrom Uncle Angry - and this is a thing I\ntry as hard as I can to stay away from in\nnormal weeks, so enjoy it while it\u2019s not\nfull of vitriol and hatred - is this: don\u2019t\nchange.\nThe thing with change is, it feels\ngood at first, especially once your parents have sodded off home in the car\nand you realise you can put your towels\nanywhere you bloody like now thanks\nMum. But the allure will wear off even-tually, and you\u2019ll realise you\u2019ve spent\nthe intervening time pandering to people\nwho are to oxygen what that fleshy bit\nin the middle of you is to your trousers.\nThat\u2019s \u2018a waist\u2019, for those of you who\nhave started drinking already (which I\nalways recommend before reading Felix). I\u2019d leave you to do the boom-tss on\nthe nearest desk. Enjoy Freshers\u2019 Week\n- I\u2019ll see you in term time.\nYou haven\u2019t come to uni to be \u2018re-born\u2019; just have fun\nThis newspaper has a long and distinguished history of informing, supporting and\nentertaining students and in the coming\nyears, during your time at this great univer-sity, this vital role that Felix plays at Imperial\nwill be ever more important.\nComing to university is an exciting experience but also a little frightening, even in the\ngood times. Saying goodbye to family and\nold school friends is difficult and finding\nyour feet at university isn\u2019t always straight-forward. At the same time however, the freedom of being an independent person and\nthe fantastic new experiences that you will\nhave are guaranteed to put a beaming smile\non your face.\nUnfortunately, as you will well know, we no\nlonger live in \u2018good times\u2019. The fact that\nyou are reading this newspaper means that\nyou were not one of 220,000 students who\ndidn\u2019t receive a place at university this year.\nNo doubt this is due to your intelligence,\nability and grades but you must be under no\nillusions about the changes that will occur\nwhile you are at university.\nThe coalition will likely implement cuts to\nuniversity funding of between 25% to 40%.\nThis will affect the quality of your teaching,\nof the facilities that you use and your university experience in general. In addition the\nBrowne Review into how students pay for\nuniversity will, at the end of October, probably recommend increasing tuition fees to\n\u00a37,000. The government may not accept\nthe review\u2019s recommendations but don\u2019t fool\nyourself into thinking that the system is going to stay the same. There will be a change.\nThere is a debate raging in this country\nabout this impending change in higher education and it is your responsibility and your\nduty to future students at Imperial to be involved in it. It has become a truism that Imperial students are apathetic and apolitical,\nbut now the politics is about you, about your\neducation and about your money. It is simply\nnot good enough to say \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\nSo make yourself heard. Engage in the debate online, in comment threads and on\nblogs. Inform yourself by reading up on the\nissue, newspapers would be a good place to\nstart. This is your moment, your opportunity\nto shape your university experience and to\nprotect it; don\u2019t let it pass you by.\nFELIX\nAngry Geek\n\u201cThe thing with\nchange is, it feels\ngood at first but the\nallure wears off and\nyou\u2019ll realise you\u2019ve\nbeen pandering to\nother people\u201d\nThe bad news is that, as\nSpiderman taught us, with great\npower comes a proportionally\nhigher number of dickheads\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nThis is a time of great\nchange for students and\nuniversities.So make sure\nyour opinions are heard\nBarack Obama...

By Rox Middleton\nConfidence\nFirst things first, believe in yourself! I\nam at heart a populist. Discussions about\nobscure 18th century Abyssinian art\nmovements can be left to know-it-all art\nstudents. but whether the art itself is in-teresting/beautiful/cool is free territory.\nYou have the right to an opinion and the\ngood news is, since you can\u2019t be wrong,\nyou don\u2019t have to be intimidated by people who know more than you.\nGet some opinions\nThis is absolutely key; you can torment\nyourself for hours and hours weighing\nup the pros and cons of a play; stand motionless in front of a painting scouring\nyour soul for reaction, or simply adopt\na judgement at random. I recommend\nthe latter. You can find cheap opinions\nin newspapers or online, steal them from\nfriends or choose bizarre reactionary\nones with absolutely no justification. Be\nprepared to defend them unashamedly\nuntil it gets completely out of hand and\nyou end up explaining to someone why\nBig Brother is an example of high-con-cept installation artwork parodying the\npetty-bourgeois nihilism Of Our Time.\nIf all else fails, quote Nietzsche, who\nsaid: It is hard enough to remember my\nopinions, without also remembering my\nreasons for them!\nIt\u2019s \u201cnegative\nspace\u201d... duh\nStay up-to-date\nGo see one thing a week.

That\u2019s\npartly because you don\u2019t\nactually see us writing them, but mainly\nbecause, unlike columnists at the Guardian who write for everybody who counts,\nand those at the Sun who write for everybody who can\u2019t, we have no idea what\nsort of crowd we\u2019re writing for.\nWhere are you from? What is your\nname? What are you here to study? Are\nyou still reading this seemingly endless\nlist of questions? These are all questions\nI\u2019d love to be able to answer but at the\nmoment I\u2019m as much in the dark as it\u2019s\npossible to be with the light actually on.\nBy far the more serious problem facing me is that I\u2019m supposed to address\nyour concerns without knowing any of\nthe above (which are clearly, as I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll agree, prerequisites for the formulation of any coherent, practical sug-gestions). What is one supposed to do? I\ncould always go to the college\u2019s statistics database and attempt to write a piece\ntailor-made for the average student, but\nseeing as they would end up being 1/4\nfemale and 3/4 other, I have a feeling I\u2019d\nbe just as much at a loss.\nGilead Amit\nThe best I can hope to do is try to answer some of the more obvious questions that might be spinning around the\npartially-loaded revolver of your mind\nin our mutual game of Russian roulette.\nThese might include: Is this the sort\nof dreck that passes for a student newspaper these days? Does Freshers\u2019 Flu\nreally exist or is it a myth, like David\nCameron\u2019s Big Society and Jeremy\nClarkson\u2019s penis? Do I really need to\nwork for a hedge fund in order to get\na well-paid job? What\u2019s a hedge fund?\nWhat\u2019s a well-paid job? And who is this\nprick with the questions anyway?\nMost of those questions have fairly\nself-evident answers. But one that may\nsurprise you is that yes, Freshers\u2019 Flu\ndoes exist. Though you will probably escape unscathed, the true victims will be\nthe seniors in your hall of residence who,\nin a desperate attempt to prove that they\nare still young, will get violently drunk,\nbe violently sick, and violently dance\nabout in the November chills without the\nfleece sweater you so assiduously promised your mother that you would wear.\nWhat I have found really makes Freshers sick, however, is advice. And if you\nhave a sensitivity to it, then my advice\nis to pile on the medication before you\nreach the end of this sentence and realise\nthat you\u2019ve already been infected.\nIt just can\u2019t be helped. Your parents\nwill by now have offered you so much\nadvice it\u2019ll seem like they\u2019ve been buying up global fortune cookie stocks in\nthe event that budget cuts cause a drastic\nshortage in Chinese restaurants.\nEven friends who, by an accident of\nparental arousal, made it to university a\nyear or two before you, will like nothing better than to feed you horror stories,\ninterspersed, of course, with legends of\ntheir quasi-Arthurian chivalry and val-our. All the while, student newspaper\ncolumnists who don\u2019t know you will\nfeel perfectly comfortable pontificating\nat you from within these very pages.\nThere\u2019s simply no escape. A powdery snowstorm of advice is blowing\nall around you, and you have no choice\nbut to pull on your fleece sweater and\ncharge through it.\nAnd what to do about it? Listen to\nit? Ignore it? Make little snowballs and\nthrow it back in our faces?\nDo whatever you want. Enjoy your-selves, be considerate towards each oth-er, and take every opportunity that comes\nyour way. If you\u2019re not sure how best to\ndo that - well, you know who to turn to.\nA\nbig hello to those of you\npicking up Felix for the\nvery first time. And a very\ngood day to you! You are\nat the beginning of one of\nthe most exciting, terrifying... and certainly unique periods of your life. University. London. People. It gives me a\nbuzz just thinking about it. To prepare\nyou for what lies in store, I will relate a\nbrief Freshers\u2019 Guide to Imperial. First\npiece of advice: if you ever need a computer in the library, learn how to say,\n\u201cStop playing World of Warcraft and get\nout!\u201d in five different languages.\nBut you will have received advice in\nabundance by now and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve\ngrown tired of this rehashed sagacity and\ndon\u2019t need it repeated once again. So, I\ndecided to write a different guide, one\nthat scratches the surface to reveal the\ngooey inner workings of Imperial. The\nwisdom contained has, taken years of\nstudy (and avoidance thereof) to attain.\nOther guides will teach you about the\ndreaded Freshers\u2019 Flu and how it can be\navoided. While this is a very real dan-ger, the threat tends to pass within a\nfortnight. What they fail to mention are\nleopards, a year-long hazard. Leopards\nare the only natural predator to pedestri-Rhys Davies\nans in London. They arrived in the city,\nas most exotic creatures do, as part of a\nprivate collection but they escaped into\nthe wild, where their numbers have been\ngrowing steadily ever since. Leopards\nhunt mainly at night so seek shelter at\nthe Union during this time. While staying in a group provides some safety, be\naware that leopards are not afraid to\nattack prey in herds, so make sure you\nhave some slow friends.\nMy guide-writing colleagues would\nthen move on to talk about the imposing\nedifice on the Queen\u2019s Lawn, the Central\nLibrary, and so shall I. I\u2019ll say it plainly;\nit is hot in there, uncomfortably hot. I\u2019ve\nseen students in shorts and sandals in the\nmiddle of winter (though, this might be\nmore a reflection on the student body.)\nBut the real danger in the library furnace\nis madness. The stress that comes with\nexams and coursework, combined with\nthe heat, has driven many a poor student\ninsane. If you experience any nausea,\nvertigo, delusions of grandeur, wall-melting, time-travel, hearing colours or\nconversations with the furniture, get out\nimmediately and seek medical help.\nYou will also be told that you will go\nto bed at four after a night of stupid and\nfun things and that you will get up at six\nto more stupid and fun things. Wait, no,\nreverse that. Time, as you will discover,\nis a most fluid construct at Imperial, as\nrigid and unyielding as a piece of overcooked spaghetti \u2013 another facet of life\nwith which you will become intimately\nacquainted. The day/night cycle will still\nexist but will be purely academic to you.\nYou will wake up in a strange place at a\nstrange time (quite possibly with strange\npeople) and wonder how you got there\n\u2013 you will only recall the entire night\u2019s\nproceedings as a few fleeting seconds.\nAt other times, especially during lectures on a Friday afternoon, mere minutes will drag on with the ancient weight\nof untold centuries. With a helpful copy\nof Felix, you might skim that down to a\nscant few decades.\nThis is by no means the end of my in-sights; this is just a taster to start you off.\nRemember that all the advice you read\nhas been gained and harvested the hard\nway, through living it. That itself is a\nguarantee of its worth. But hey, you can\nignore all this if you want \u2013 just so long\nas you remember this; The best way to\nsurvive in London, and to learn what\u2019s\nwhat in Imperial is to get out there and\nlive it for yourself... avoiding leopards\nwhere possible.\nFreshers\u2019Tip #29:Avoid leopards\n\u201cDuring lectures on\na Friday afternoon,\nmere minutes will\ndrag on with the\nancient weight of\nuntold centuries\u201d\n\u201cFreshers\u2019 Flu is a\nreal phenomenon.\nWhat I have found\nreally makes Freshers\nsick, however, is\nadvice.\u201d\nLetters to the Editor\nThese comment pages are\nfilled each week with horrendous diatribes, outrageous\narguments and confused circular logic; and that\u2019s just the\nEditorials. But they wouldn\u2019t\nbe anywhere near as fun without the letters and responses\nof the students. The Felix letters section is your message-board. It\u2019s a place where you\ncan complain about your lectur-ers, about the food on campus\nand most importantly about\nthe content and execution of\nour beloved cat Felix. If you\ndon\u2019t like what we\u2019ve written,\nhow we\u2019ve written it or even the\nperson who has written it, then\nsend the Editor a letter at\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nYou don\u2019t have to be polite or\neven reasonable. It might be a\ngood idea to spell check your\nletter before sending it (it is always embarrassing to criticize\nsomeone else\u2019s efforts when\nyour own is frankly lacking\u2026)\nbut aside from that, allow your\npersonality to come across in\nyour writing.\nOne more thing, try to be brief.\nAn 800 word letter is just a\nrant, and nobody likes a rant.\n(Well we do, but we just won\u2019t\nprint it in full...)\nDo you want to be a\ncolumnist?\nAre you hilarious, topical, witty\nand well written? No? Well neither are any of our columnists.\nIf there is something that you\nfeel strongly about, a burning\nissue that cannot be left un-tackled, a point that you feel\nneeds to be made urgently,\nthen feel free to submit a 600-800 word piece to comment.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk. We will\nallow people to write anonymously but we will not accept\nanonymous submissions (we\nat least have to know who you\nare.)\nWe\u2019ll give extra brownie points\nto students who let us know\nwhat they\u2019re writing about before they write it.\nAlternatively, see \u201cLetters to\nThe Editor\u201d above\n\n"

Combine the thousands of clubs there are in London with\nthe overbearing feeling that I\u2019m approaching a very premature mid-life\ncrisis and you\u2019ll understand why introducing London\u2019s nightlife to a Fresher is\nincredibly difficult.\nNot only do different people dance on\ndifferent ends of the social spectrum,\nthis said spectrum is multi-dimensional.\nFrom the kid that parties every single\nnight to the occasional pub drinker;\nfrom the ladies\u2019 night in Central to the\nhipsters\u2019 night in East London; from\nDaddy\u2019s girls on penthouse clubs to \u2018yer\nmates\u2019 on the \u00a31 for shots deals. Spectrums within spectrums, and now you\ncan see why I\u2019m not simply listing off\na number of clubs I think you should be\nheading to.\nI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m leaving the research and dog work up to you. This is\nnot because I wish to remain blameless\nfor a disaster of a night out, but no matter how honest and impressionable a\nreader you may be, it is likely most of\nmy recommendations will be ignored.\nAnd by rights you should be ignoring\nme if I was just giving you an endless\nlist of venues to frequent in this gargantuan city. Time Out magazine this is not.\nSome cities sleep when the sun heads\nbeyond the horizon, but some cities\nawaken. Fuck the small suburban town\nyou call home, because while Watford,\nThurrock and Wrington (wherever you\nmight come from) doze off into a quiet\nevening, a bright-eyed London is most\ndefinitely awake.\nYou can discover London twice. Once\nduring the day and once again come\n10pm. Furthermore, discovery requires\ntrial and error, and that\u2019s another reason\nwhy I\u2019m happy to keep tight-lipped on\nthe recommendation front. Follow the\ncrowds during Welcome Week and you\nmay just find yourself in a shitty club\nthat everyone except you seems to en-joy. Follow another crowd and you may\nend up snorting ketamine off the floor of\na squat party in Hackney.\nWhatever you consider a shit night\nout, you will inevitably have one. You\u2019ll\nslowly build a black list of clubs and areas of London youvow to never return\nto. At the same time your taste in venues\nto get trashed in will start to refine and\nbefore you know it you\u2019ll be the world\nauthority on London nightlife. Maybe.\nThere are alcoholic wonders closer to\nhome too; they are on your doorsteps\nin South Kensington. There\u2019s a certain\nje ne sais quoi about home turf which\nturns even the most refined of your peers\ninto bona fide waste gashes. You\u2019ll witness the pissed of the very pissed in the\nUnion and Eastside Bar. Hangovers the\nnext morning should be as memorable\nas the actual night before, but that\u2019s the\ncharm of student life: lectures are effectively optional.\nThe measure of a hangover positively correlates with the probability\nthat you\u2019re not Peter Pan. The worse\nyour hangover, the older you\u2019re getting.\nSoon, each Facebook status that implies\n\u2018worst hangover everrrrr\u2019(or to the same\neffect) will simply be a public depiction\nof your youth degrading before everyone\u2019s eyes. No more will you be the\nsprightly litre-of-cider-an-hour 17 year\nold who could wake up the next morning\nfeeling perfectly fine. (It is the social,\nand less illegal, equivalent of Michael\nJackson getting away with fiddling with\nkiddies.)\nWe\u2019re harping on about \u2018London\u2019\nlike it\u2019s some sort of magical adventure\nworld for forgivable drunken antics. It\nis, but there is such a massive variety\nof other things to do than shifting your\nliver function into top gear each night.\nThere\u2019s comedy clubs, after hours museum sand gallery openings, gigs, open-air cinemas, proms, and 24-hour cafes\nto name a just a few. There\u2019s nothing a\nsimple Internet search won\u2019t find, and\ntrust me on this, I\u2019ve googled some sordid things indeed.\nWelcome to student life in London.\nBelieve me when I say it\u2019s unforgettable.\nDan Wan\nLondon\u2019s nightlife is constantly evolving.\nA prescriptive list of clubs would be futile\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m\nleaving the research\nand dog work up\nto you. Time Out\nmagazine this is not.\nNor should it be\u201d\n\n"

Now, you can have science do it for you.\nItems required:\n\u2022 Cans.\n\u2022 Cooker hob.\n\u2022 Flat container.\nFirstly, a word of warning: this experiment involves\nboiling water and hot metal. Take appropriate\nprecautions.\n1.Take an empty beer can (or find one of the rarer\nempty soft-drinks cans in your bin), one without a\nplastic widget.\n2. Pour in a small amount of water, a centimetre\nor so deep.\n3. Place the can on a cooker hob and heat until\nthe water is boiling and lots of steam is coming out\nof the top.\n4. Fill a shallow container with cold water.\n5. Pick up the can, preferably with tongs or similar\nequipment and quickly but carefully invert into the\ncold water so the can opening is at the bottom, under the water surface.\nHow does it work?\nAs the can is heated, the air inside is displaced by\nthe expanding steam. As the can is then cooled, the\nsteam condenses. This happens much too rapidly\nfor the water to enter the can and as the pressure\ninside decreases, the external air pressure should\ncrush the can. For those of you who do not deserve\nto be at Imperial, this is of course the basis for the\nfirst ever steam engine.\nBedroom Science\nand Experiments\nInfrared Glasses\nContrary to popular belief, the human eye can see\nin the infrared (IR), albeit only in high intensity light.\nIn order to see in IR, all other wavelengths must\nbe blocked. Because the human eye is very poor\nat detecting IR light, a powerful source is required.\nLuckily, the sun will do.\n1.Remove lenses from the glasses or goggles.\n2.Cut out filters to fit.\n3.Replace with three sheets of Congo blue and\none of Primary red and bingo.\nHow does it work?\nThree sheets of \u201cCongo blue\u201d and one of \u201cPrimary\nred\u201d create a low-pass filter. The human eye is a\nhigh-pass filter and together these create a band-pass filter; the band passed in this case is in the\nIR range.\n15 essential things that all\nScientists should know\n5 Science Chat-up Lines\nWould there be any resistance if I tried to take you ohm?\nKatya-yani Vyas\nYou\u2019ve all heard about the famous Imperial ra-tio, so yes, we are a male-dominated university.\nHowever, if you are male, you are quite likely\nto run into a female that catches your attention\nat some point. In this event the following chat-up lines are not, under any circumstances, to\nbe used. You will not only have cemented your\nself as a person with the social aptitude of a tea-spoon, but will have also ruined your chances\nwith said female. If you are a female, feel free\nto use them, I don\u2019t think it will substantially\nhinder your chances.\nWould there be any resistance if I asked to\ntake you ohm?\n\u201cHow can I know hundreds of pi digits\u2026\nbut not the digits of your phone number?\u201d\nYou are an acid and I am like litmus; every\ntime I meet you I turn bright red.\nYou\u2019re so sweet, I am developing insulin\nresistance.\nI\u2019m studying quantum physics so I know\nwe\u2019re going back to either your place or\nmine.\n4 Hangover Tips\nBeing a university student, let\u2019s face it, you\nwill probably spend a disproportionate amount\nof your time consuming alcohol and a lot of\nthe time this will be during the week when you\nshould really be sleeping in preparation for a\nday of lectures or labs etc. So, how do we solve\nthe problem of the hangover that will make us\nrue our existence the next day? Well, we\u2019re scientists aren\u2019t we! Logic will prevail!\nBefore you drink eat a meal that is full of\ncarbohydrates. This will prepare your stomach for the alcohol and increase the time\ntaken for the body to absorb the alcohol.\nAlso take a vitamin tablet, this will help top\nup the vitamins that you will lose through\nfrequent urination.\nTo lessen your morning suffering take a vitamin supplement in the morning and then,\nif it is really severe, some scientists have\nsuggested that diarrhoea medicine will help\nbecause it replaces minerals and rehydrates\nyour body.\nNew research has suggested that the famous\nbacon sandwich does indeed have soothing\neffects on a hangover. The food increases\nyour metabolism and the protein in bacon\nbreaks down to amino acids which replace\nneurotransmitters. Couple with a glass of\norange juice (vitamin C helps get rid of tox-ins) and a banana (potassium helps regulate\nthe your body\u2019s pH balance, and hopefully\nyou should feel a little better.\nFinally you could just delay the hangover\nwith the \u2018hair of the dog\u2019 method which just\nrequires that you carry on drinking when\nyou wake up. But unless you plan to spend\nyour life in a state of perpetual drunkenness\nyou\u2019ll have to face the pain eventually.\nObviously, the best cure for a hangover is to\ndrink in moderation but I can almost hear your\nderisive laughter\u2026\n3 ways to bluff your way\nthough that tutorial\nIn the event that your attempts at preventing a\nhangover fail miserably, you are going to need\nto use some damn good bluffing. Luckily I\nhave just the thing for you.\nIf your tutorial is in the morning you can\nclaim that you have delayed sleep-phase\nsyndrome. This generally causes the sufferer\nto have great difficulty in waking up early.\nJust make it seem like you are about to die\nand the tutor may feel sorry for you.\nIf you haven\u2019t done any work, the safest\nbet is to pretend to ask a question. Start by\npointing to a question and saying, \u2018I just\nwanted to ask you about this, so I integrated\n(or plotted a histogram if you\u2019re a biolo-gist) and\u2026hmm\u2026\u2019Now stare intently at the\npaper for a few seconds and then exclaim,\n\u2018Ah! that\u2019s it, thank you so much professor\u2019.\nThen strut off looking extremely excited\nabout your breakthrough.\nThe absolute ultimate excuse requires a little\nbit of work. first discover what your tutor\u2019s\narea of interest is, then look up a few facts\nabout it. Email your tutor a few hours after\nthe tutorial apologising profusely for not attending and then explain that you were at a\nlecture on their particular interest and say\nhow fascinating it was. A risky strategy but\nultimately the most effective if you can pull\nit off.\n2 lines that you should\nprepare your mind for\nPeople who say these lines to you can basically\nbe disregarded as lesser social beings...\n\u201cYAH, but A-levels were, like, sooo easy, I\nliterally did no work.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I applied to Oxford/Cambridge, but\nI didn\u2019t want to go there anyway\u201d\n1 book you should\npretend you\u2019ve read\n\u2018The Trouble With Physics\u2019 by Lee Smolin\n\u2018In search of Schrodinger\u2019s Cat\u2019 was so three\nyears ago, this is the new book to wax lyrical\nabout. If you\u2019re a physicist, you should actually read it, otherwise just tell people you have,\nmutter something about string theory and wave\nyour hands around (gesticulating wildy throws\npeople off and makes you seem clever yet\nloveable).\nScience Editors: Katya-yani Vyas\nJames Goldsack\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

In a reversal of the\nprinciples of conventional Fresher psychology, or\n\u2018Freshcology\u2019 as it is now known in academic cir-cles, SHIT\u2019s findings show that \u2018herd mentality\u2019,\nwhere a tight-knit group of friends is formed with\nno basis aside from the random allocation of each\nperson to a certain corridor, creates far stronger\nfriendships than common interests or mutual\nrespect.\n\u2018Liking one another is a weakness\u2019 says distinguished psychologist Jose Videira, \u2018The very act of\nchoosing a friend because you have something in\ncommon with them is an dangerous mistake \u2013 it\u2019s\nfar better to simply pack together with those nearest to you and viciously shun any individual who\nattempts to join once the group has been formed\u2019.\nIn fact, it seems these cliques become robust so\nquickly that, in today\u2019s universities, attempting to\nhang out with someone not from your corridor/\nsubject/ethnicity is a risky business.\n\u2018I felt like R Kelly at a parent-teacher evening\u2019\nsays traumatized ex-Fresher Stephen Jeffrey, who\nwas savagely beaten by a gang from Beit E3 after\ncoming to return a borrowed calculator. \u2018It was my\nfault really, he admits, \u2018I should have realised that\nthey weren\u2019t just living side by side, they all did\nthe same subject as well \u2013 the only time they didn\u2019t\nsee each other was when dogging \u2013 it was an accident waiting to happen\u2019.\nThis evidence is excellent news for sufferers of\nthe disease CTTNTY (Cling To Those Nearest To\nYou), a bacterial infection that up to 97% of Freshers experience, as they can now embrace their illness by walking around with a smug sense of ac-complishment, knowing that they will go on to live\nmore enriched lives.\nPoor little Stephen Jeffrey just wanted to return his calculator\nDrunken\nMate of\nThe Week\nTwatter\nCheeky_Chaz\nam totes all over gaga\u2019s meat dress.\nwud totally spaff all over dat\nLouis_da_BOMB22\nduuuude... dat is well rough\nCheeky_Chaz\nPiss off you baguette! you\u2019re da one\nin love wiv da fat girl from the xx\nIzzieBrunel_XD\nNah bruv, it ain\u2019t cool. it\u2019s offensive\nto animals innit?\nLouis_da_BOMB22\n....AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nIzzieBrunel_XD\nWhy you always hatin?\ndamn_diggidy_stein49\nne1 wana see a photo of louis\u2019 mom\nin the shower? http://bit.ly/4mtMyr\nCheeky_Chaz\ni think i\u2019m gona throw up...\nFreshers\u2019 Week renamed\nto Welcome Week\nEach week we publish a photo of a fine\nImperial student, caught on camera by\ntheir mates in a state of... well in a state\nthat they wouldn\u2019t want their parents to\nsee.

To make damn sure you\ndon\u2019t end up with \u201cCalifornia Gurls\u201d or some Gaga shit engraved on your frontal\nlobe for eternity, we have compiled a set of brilliant tunes that you yourself must\ntrigger at key moments during the week, effectively ensuring that the party never\ndies\u2026 IN YOUR MIND!\nGod knows you\u2019re gonna be tired of this\nclub quickly, but what He also knows is\nwe\u2019ve all been there. So if your plans are\nto stumble into this cesspool of musical\nfaeces, you might as well stock up on\ngood pop music beforehand (cuz there\nain\u2019t gonna be none later\u2026). This is\nwhere Swedish dance-pop queen Robyn\ncomes into play, backed by an impeccable dancehall beat courtesy of Major\nLazer mastermind Diplo.\nOh the horror. Trust me, 80p vodka-coke\ncan only mean one thing: black puke on\nyour way out. But you might as well experience this hellhole firsthand, if anything just to pin a definition to the word\n\u201csleazy\u201d. Ageing hipster James Murphy\nknows a thing or two about being sleazy,\nas he rants about drunk girls waiting an\nhour to pee and drunk boys keeping in\npace with pedophiles. A filthy little tune\nto prepare for one messy night.\nGreg Power Odds are you\u2019re going to want to kick\noff your stay here at Imperial College\nby getting plastered at the Union. If not\nthen somebody will drag you there anyway and if they don\u2019t, well something is\nplainly amiss. So kick back and indulge\nin a fine pint in Beit Quad with Wavves\u2019\nanthem of the summer in the background\nas you make the most of the last rays of\nsunshine.\nFirst drinking\nsession in\nthe Quad\n\u201cPost-Acid\u201d by Wavves\nPre-Tiger Tiger\n(lashup)\n\u201cDancehall Queen\u201d\nby Robyn\nPre-Cheapskates\n\u201cDrunk Girls\u201d\nby LCD Soundsystem\nIn case you have a\nbreak-up\n\u201cFuck you\u201d\nby Cee-Lo Green\nUh-oh. Did your boyfriend/girlfriend/\ntransgender partner from back home\nbreak up with you just before uni? Not\nfeeling up to non-stop partying? AW\nHELL NO. Don\u2019t let that dick/bitch/\nreptile spoil your fun! Cee-Lo Green,\nthe voice behind Gnarls Barkley, will\nget you through your break-up in 3 minutes 46 seconds flat with this classic soul\nnumber. Give it one spin and your game\nwill be instantaneously refreshed.\nWhen all is said and done (and your liver is threatening to sue), you will have\nhad one of the craziest, far-out and debauched weeks of your entire life. You\nmight not remember much of it, but\nbelieve me, it was awesome. It just so\nhappens that Canuck hip-hop star Drake\nalso gets a little too tipsy from time to\ntime, blacks out and doesn\u2019t remember jack shit in the morning. \u201cWho the\nfuck are y\u2019all?\u201d you might ask too as\nyou look around at all these new faces.\nEspecially when they all seem to know\nyour name but you seriously have no\nclue who the hell these kids are. Simply\nact all nonchalant and head to the Union\nwith your new acquaintances to buy \u2018em\na round. Or inversely get them to buy\nyou a drink. It\u2019s all good. The party is\nNEVER over.\nThe first of many hangovers to come. If\nit feels like a pig shat in your head after\nlast night\u2019s misdemeanors, don\u2019t fret.\nEverybody else in Halls (and possibly\nlying next to you on the floor) is feeling\nequally terrible. It is Welcome\u2019Week after all, and the hangover is an indispensable \u2013 albeit painful - part of the Grand\nCycle of Fun.\nSo break out the Berocca, fall right\nback into bed and put on this incredible\nremix (arguably the best remix in the\nhistory of music... EVER) by mashup\nmadmen The Hood Internet. The opposing worlds of Mercury Prize-winners\nThe XX and rabid gangsta-cum-actor\nDMX collide on this aptly titled masterpiece of modern music.\nAs your head throbs and your alcohol-induced death wish grows, just remember DMX went through tougher shit\nthan you ever will. You wanna fight\nhim? \u201cFIGHT THESE TEARS\u201d. More\nimportantly he\u2019ll give you some key\nadvice here: \u201cDon\u2019t give up, you\u2019re too\nstrong\u201d.\nThe last night of\nFreshers\u2019 Week\n\u201cOver\u201d\nby Drake\nFirst Imperial\nhangover\n\u201cXX Gonna Give to Ya\u201d\nby The Hood Internet\nHad a fucking awesome week? Made\na gazillion smashing lifetime mates?\nThat\u2019s all fine and dandy, but you seem\nto have forgotten the whole part about\nImperial being one of the leading hardcore intellectual institutions in the entire\nfreakin\u2019 world. Maybe you should have\nthought about that before downing that\nlast Snakebite. No regrets though, get\nyour iPod out and get psyched up with\nthis rocking number from Felix Music\u2019s\nalbum of the week.\nYour first lecture\n\u201cReady to Start\u201d\nby Arcade Fire\nHave your say on this article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Clad in a potent combination\nof brands ranging from Le Coq Sportif trackies to Tiffany&Co\njewelry, he is a true Imperial gentleman.\nThe Athletic Guy\nUsually curly haired and large chinned with oversized calfs from\nall the rock-climbing, mountain-biking and/or trekking he does.\nOverzealous about sport to the point that even his bulging veins\nhave started sprouting their own bulging veins.\nThe Hot Girl\nHard to see, as she is usually surrounded by a sizeable group of\nassholes. You can bet her sweet ass and half a titty that some idiot\nwill appoint himself as her bodyguard, by which I mean follow\nher around like a sheep with Alzheimer\u2019s. Almost guaranteed not\nto be English.\nThe Promoter\nThis person seems to have decided that milking newly forming\nfriendships for a couple quid is a good idea - avoid being invited to\nwhatever terrible student club night he\u2019s promising you free drinks\nat by feigning deafness or lamping him in the scrotum: the latter\nis usually preferable.\nThe Girl Making a Fresh Start\nThis girl doesn\u2019t have any old photos of herself on Facebook. You\nwill never see any of her old friends around halls and has almost\nnothing to talk about pre-freshers week. She\u2019s left all that behind.\nUnfortunately, Imperial is a breeding ground for girls like this -surprised that they actually have the ability to make friends, they\nusually become obnoxious self important bitches (or just plain\nlovely, it\u2019s kind of hit or miss.)\nToo Cool for School\nThis guy is slightly too suave and looks a\nbit confused at the lack of females \u2013 like\nhe expects someone to say \u2018JUST KIDDING!\u2019 and point to a room where all the\ngirls are kept. Wears a scarf while cooking.\nThe Recluse\nYou won\u2019t meet this guy/\ngirl until you\u2019re moving\nout of halls and you\u2019ll only\nknow of their existence\nthrough chance glimpses of\ntheir bedroom door closing.\n\n"

Stalls are clustered\nby type so if you\u2019re a fan of the outdoors or a keen\nmusician you should be able to find the groups\nassociated with those pursuits all in one area.\nHowever, I would strongly advise you to make an\neffort to visit each area even if you doubt you\u2019ll find\nanything interesting there; coming to university\nis one of the best times to begin a new hobby or\npastime, and even if you don\u2019t see anything of\ninterest at least you\u2019ll pick up a few more freebies!\nWe\u2019re incredibly proud of the diversity and dedication\nof our groups, allowing students to pursue almost\nany interest they can imagine, so make sure you take\nfull advantage of the breadth of activities we offer\nduring your time here.\nAt Freshers\u2019 Fair we operate a strict no trading\npolicy, so you needn\u2019t worry about having to part\nwith any money on the day. Instead the clubs will\nencourage you to sign up to their mailing lists so that\nyou can be kept informed of when they are meeting\nand what they\u2019re up to. Don\u2019t worry about signing up\nto too many as it\u2019s easy to unsubscribe once you\u2019ve\ndecided which groups you\u2019d like to remain involved\nwith \u2013 initially the best idea is to keep your options\nopen and then whittle down your choices once\nyou\u2019ve listened for a few weeks to what the clubs\nhave to offer.\nOnce you\u2019ve decided which Clubs, Societies or\nProjects you want to join, most require you to pay a\nmembership fee to join. Many actually run free taster\nsessions to demonstrate their activities. They can be\na little daunting, say if you\u2019ve never done ballroom\ndancing, but many similarly daring people will be in\nthe same boat and the groups will be familiar with\nand more than willing to help out newcomers.\nIf you do miss any early gatherings of groups you\nare interested in, don\u2019t worry as you can join a group\nat any time of the year. Likewise, you can sign up\nto any group\u2019s mailing list whenever you like. Just\nget in contact with the Chair of the group. Club,\nSocieties and Project contact details can be found on\nimperialcollegeunion.org.\nEnjoy the Fair and I look forward to meeting many of\nyou on the day!\nHeatherJones\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nTuesday 5 October, 11am \u2013 4pm\nBeitQuad BQ\nPrince Consort Road\nUnion Building\nBBQ\nFirst Floor\nSecond Floor\nUnionDiningHall UDH\nUnionConcertHall UCH\n2 4\n3\n1\n6 8\n7\n5\n10 12\n11\n9\n14 16\n15\n13\nStage\n37 39\n38\n33 35\n34\n29 31\n30\n25 27\n26\n21 23\n22\n17 19\n18\nDRAMSOC\n45 47\n46 48\n41 43\n42 44\n20\n24\n28\n36\n32\n40\nimperialcollegeunion.org\n10\n4\n5\n6 3\n13\n2\n1\n7\n9\n8\n12\n15\n14\n11\n\n"

If we all\nlived like Phoebe in Friends, and turn\noff films before the distressing parts, the\nfilm wouldn\u2019t have nearly as a high a rep\nas it does now.\n21\nfelix FRIDAY 01 OCTOBER 2010\nFILM\nCritically acclaimed films\nthat are actually terrible\nAt some point, the\nidea that these films\nare \u2018compelling\u2019took\nhold. In truth, they\u2019re\ndeafeningly boring and\nachingly pretentious\nBy Matt Allinson\nWe all know the importance of conversation while making\nfriends in your first week, especially the pit-falls of trying to\nnot to sound lame. However, in spite of your best efforts to be\ncool, some pretentious knobber will always have something\nsmart to say in response to your movie opinions, usually by\nknocking whatever you say. Let\u2019s call him Mr Knock, for ex-ample. Well, fear not Freshers, I have produced a cut-out-and-keep guide to four really powerful movie opinions that will\nleave you the winner in any conversation with Mr Knock.\nRequiem for a Dream\nis just plain awful\nFirst off most people will venture in a\npopular \u201cdark\u201d indie film that they have\nseen in a little attempt to be cool, most\ncommon of these are Donnie Darko and\nRequiem for a Dream. Donnie Darko I\nlove, (Tears for Fears and Echo and the\nBunnymen soundtrack? Om nom nom)\nbut Requiem for a Dream is a poorly\nwritten and incredibly poorly acted\nteenage navel-gaze-fest. The only reason that anyone thinks it\u2019s any good is\na master stroke of directing, by which\nAaronofsky bludgeons the audience\nwith a such a distressing penultimate\nscene that combined with the daze we\nfind ourselves in after constantly getting trapped in Jared Leto\u2019s so-hollowit\u2019s-captivating stare we forget that the\nfilm itself was total dross. Upon forgetting what the preceding 90 minutes of\ncinema were actually like, the audience\nforms its opinion on what it just saw,\nwhich ostensibly boils down to the following questions: \u201cDo I like watching 2\nwomen go at it ass to ass with a double\nended dildo?\u201d or \u201cDo I desperately want\nto ravage the lead singer of 30 seconds\nto mars?\u201d as the entire world will answer yes to at least one of those ques-Pulp Fiction is by far\nand away Tarantino\u2019s\nworst film\nAm\u00e9lie is the worst\nthing to come out of\nFrance since syphilis\nMuch I\u2019m sure has been made to the\nfreshers about the ratio of boys to girls at\nImperial, but gents, can I just stress that\nif you\u2019re using the \u201cinvite her round for\na DVD and then lock the door\u201d method\nof seduction (or the Ollie Calderbank, as\nit\u2019s known) make sure that for the love\nof God she doesn\u2019t bring Ami\u00e9le. I cannot stand that film, it\u2019s dross and boring\nand just because it\u2019s set in Paris and the\nsun is shining and everyone is swanning\naround talking French does not make it\nBonus points: say that you preferred \u03c0,\nciting that Aaronofsky used all the same\nstylistic features of RfaD but with actual\nactors, and shot it in black and white so\nit is therefore better.\nAs we all know, the entire point of\nPulp Fiction was as an elabourate vehicle to allow Tarantino to use the word\n\u201cN****r\u201d to Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s face.\nWhilst a ballsy move (after all, this article is just an elaborate vehicle to get\nthe word \u201cn****r\u201d in to Felix... (nice\ntry - Ed.)) it doesn\u2019t really constitute a\ngood film. And that whole dicing around\nwith the chronology of the timeline just\nresulted in confusion and a million copycat films/episodes of ER/dramsoc pro-ductions, each one worse than the pre-ceding. But in all seriousness, maybe\nit\u2019s because at every DVD night in first\nyear we wound up watching this bloody\nfilm that I\u2019m sick of it. And anyway,\nJackie Brown with its severely limited\nlevel of violence and incredible soundtrack makes for much better viewing.\nBonus points: use the above argument\nad-verbatim with a bouncer at Brixton\nAcademy.\na good film. Luckily at Imperial there is\na very high likelyhood you will find a\nwoman who loves Star Wars, Lord of the\nRings and Big Trouble in Little china,\nbut unfortunately she\u2019ll probably have a\nbeard. If you manage to lock your room\nmate out and a girly girl in, who insists\non watching a film where people speak\nFrench and run around Paris all day,\nmake her watch La Haine instead.\nBonus points: If she\u2019ll still have sex\nwith you after watching La Haine then\nthat\u2019s a bonus, right? Also, good effort...\nThe dialogue in the\nfinal scene of Brick\nreally moved you...\nright...\nThis is the big one, if someone has failed\nto be out-cooled by everything you\u2019ve\nsaid; and we\u2019re including talking at great\nlength about the advantages of black and\nwhite over colour cinema, how M. Night\nShyamalayn was never any good in the\nfirst place and settled the argument of\ngreatest soundtrack (Blade Runner vs.\nApocalypse Now, in case you needed\nreminding), throw in, as an off the cuff\nremark, how your favourite dialogue in\ncinema is the final scene in Brick, that\nyou found it inspired, insightful and\nmost of all, moving.\nLots of cool people watch Brick. It\u2019s\nbecause it\u2019s made by attractive teenag-ers, about attractive teenagers, for attractive teenagers. Also fuck all happens\nfrom beginning to end, and as we\u2019ve seen\ntime and again, for example Napoleon\nDynamite and the Big Lebowski: films\nwith very little happening are COOL.\nHowever, no one understands what either character says at the end of Brick.\nNothing. Nadda. It\u2019s some whingy Californian cunts mumbling to each other on\na noisy hillside about the fuck-all that\nhappened in the overly trendy preceding\ndull-as-horseshit hour and half. Worst of\nall, the DVD hasn\u2019t even got subtitles,\nso we\u2019re all stuck having to turn it to full\nblast and get our Californian-English\ndictionaries out. However by pretending\nto have understood, and what\u2019s more be\nmoved by it, you will truly become a\nfilm God (douche)...\nBonus points: This takes effort, but\nlook the scene up online, commit it to\nmemory and if someone calls your bluff\n(which they are likely too, having been\ninfuriated by it themselves) you can rattle the whole thing back.\nThis film is just an\nelaborate excuse to\nuse the word n****r\nisn\u2019t it?\nWhat did you just say?\nFilm Editors: Matt Allinson\nJade Hoffman\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Ditching the grandiose accusatory statements\nagainst government and organized religion of 2007\u2019s\nNeon Bible, this time their lyrics focus on intro-spection, coming of age and having to abandon the\ndreams and aspirations of youth to fit the mold that\nmodern society imposes. It\u2019s not all gloomy though,\nas two-part finale \u201cSprawl\u201d tells us it\u2019s not too late to\nditch the suits and return to the wilderness.

Hype Williams will turn the room into\na sickhead dancefloor with their unique brand of\npsychedelic electro. But the act that has to be\nwitnessed live to be believed is Factory Floor,\na trio of industrial mentalists who will leave you\nbreathless as they turn pulsating noise into an\nepic trance performance.

We all know that\nlive music beats meeting new friends any day\nof the week (especially Saturday.) On your\nfirst night of university you need to be celebrating Ninja Tune\u2019s 20th birthday at Ewer\nStreet Car Park with legendary artists like\nRoots Manuva, Mr Scruff and Ninja Tunes\nlabel founder Coldcut.\nFailing that, head along to Dance Magic\nDance at The Old Blue Last in Shoreditch.\nGirl/boy combo Peepholes will be combining\ntheir electro vibes with noise-rock alongside\nThe Gentle Friendly\u2019s unique brand of noisy\npsych-rock\nWhat could be better, on your second night at\nuni, than a reformed Australian garage punk\nband from the 80s (Ed - I can think of a few\nthings actually Greg...)\nHoodoo Gurus are guaranteed to blow your\nears apart at the Shepherds Bush Empire, one\nof London\u2019s best live music venues.\nThe Islington Academy welcomes hilarious\nblue-grass rockers Hayseed Dixie on Monday\nnight. The name of the game is hard-rock songs\nre-imagined with ukeleles, banjos and maybe a\nbit of corn hanging from your mouth.\nBut if you\u2019re interested in something a bit\nmore serious and a lot more melancholy, then\nJunip at XOYO is just the thing for you. Junip are Jose Gonzalez\u2019 soft-rock band (you\nknow, the guy who covered Heartbeats by The\nKnife... you don\u2019t know The Knife? Oh dear...)\nPerfect for seducing that girl that you just\nmet on your corridor; feel free to use the above\npiece of pop-trivia to impress her even more.\nEach week at The Rhythm Factory, 5 new\nalternative bands take to the stage and let rip\nwith a range of sounds from punk to electro to\nhip-hop. Let Them Eat Gak is definitely one\nto put in your weekly planner (but don\u2019t be surprised if people get a bit confused when you\nstart raving on about how awesome gak is).\nHush at The Royal Albert Hall is our recommended gig of the week, and for good reason.\nQuite frankly it\u2019s stunning that three of the biggest up and coming bands are playing together\nin our little posh neck of the woods.\nBut to be honest you\u2019re spoilt for choice on\nWednesday. US pop-rock experimentalists Of\nMontreal at KOKO are guaranteed to pull a\nbatshit crazy performance complete with over-the-top theatrics and you won\u2019t go wrong with\nclassic Seattle grunge band Mudhoney at\nElectric Ballrooms in Camden. These guys\nwere basically the inspiration for a generation\nof musicians including Kurt Cobain.\nMale Bonding, the triumphant East London neo-grunge act that is taking the world\nby storm with their amazing album \u201cNothing\nHurts\u201d are supported alt-rock duo Blood Red\nShoes at Electric Ballrooms.\nBut it\u2019s a generous evening again with Errors\nand The Twilight Sad providing a Scottish\ndouble-bill of instrumental post-electro and\nindie rock at XOYO and a night of psychdelic\nfolk-rock at the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire\nwith Black Mountain and Black Angels.\nThis is the problem with music in London.\nThere\u2019s far too much goddamn awesome\nchoice every night!\nYour week ends in tremendous style as Imperial Summer Ball star Benjamin Paul BallanceDrew (Plan B) brings his increasingly successful rap/soul hybrid to the Brixton Academy.\nBut elsewhere in London, things are getting\nfucking mental with Lacuna Coil + Slaves To\nGravity kicking names and taking ass at the\nRelentless Garage in Islington and Architects, the finest sickhead hardcore metal/punk\nband to come out of Brighton blowing the\nspeakers at KOKO.\nTruly not a night for the light-hearted, but\nby Friday, you\u2019ll all be well-seasoned music\nfreaks\n\n"

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 01 OCTOBER 2010\nThe student voice of\nImperial since 1949\n\u201cThe need has been felt for some time\nfor a frequently published journal to\ncomment upon the affairs of the College\nwhilst they are still topical\u2026\u201d\nThese were the first words ever printed in Felix. They modestly declared the\nintentions of the newspaper\u2019s founder\nand first Editor, E.M. Hughes and have\nguided subsequent Editors ever since.\nThough he could have hardly expected\nthe successes that this newspaper has\nachieved in its long history, it was auspicious that when it was first published\non the morning of the 9th of December\n1949, all 600 copies sold out within\nhours.\nMany things that were true for Felix\non that misty morning are still true to-day. Primarily the paper still \u201cdepends\nprincipally upon you, our readers\u201d to\nproduce articles, to air your opinions by\nwriting in our letters section and to care\nenough about the on-goings of your university to pick up your free issue every\nFriday. And admittedly yes much has\nchanged. We are no longer printed on\ncampus, we no longer charge students\nsixpence for the paper and we like to\nthink that there\u2019s a little bit more colour\non these pages than there was 60 years\nago. We sadly don\u2019t donate our profits\nto Sports Day any more and we now employ a student full-time to produce the\npaper (E.M. Hughes, like many students\ninvolved in societies today, gave up his\nvaluable free time in the pursuit of his\npassions.)\nBut though the design and production\nis different, our values and aims remain\nthe same. Our purpose is to inform, elucidate and entertain you. We are here to\nstand up for student issues, for the truth\nand also, to take the piss (just a little bit.)\nFor 60 years Imperial students have\ncollaborated together to produce this\nwonderful publication so you can trust\nthat this paper will never be written or\nedited with arrogance; knowing the talent of Imperial students it is certain that\nsomeone will have written with more\nclarity or edited with more thoroughness\nat some point in the paper\u2019s history.\nAnd so I end by humbly asking you to\ncontribute to the paper this year. Whether it be by writing an article, an angry\nletter or editing the work of other stu-dents, know that Felix can never survive\nwithout you. And in return, I promise\nto uphold the intentions of the paper\u2019s\noriginal founders with grace, humility\nand hopefully a bit of humour.\nOh and the name? As far as I can tell\nit was the nickname of a particularly\npopular student called F.C. Ewels. I\u2019m\nguessing he must be quite pleased about\nhow it all turned out.\nHOW CAN\nYOU GET\nINVOLVED?\nShort answer: It\u2019s really easy\nand we\u2019d love for you to\njoin. Long answer: Read on\nThis newspaper is written by entirely by\nstudents and we will never reject your\ncontributions. We are all volunteers and\nhad absolutely no prior experience when\nwe started working for Felix. You don\u2019t\nthink you can write?

So don\u2019t be shy.

You\nopen it up and find your wretched\ndeformed twin sister that you never\nknew about. Several orgasms later\nyou\u2019re off to a new life at Imperial. yay!\nTaurus\nThis week, in a desperate attemt to\nemulate your hero Ted Bundy, you\nbrutally mutilate your room mate,\nbludgen them to death and end the\nnight living out your sexual fantasies\nwith their corpse. No one wants to\njoin you. You fist the corpse alone.\nGemini\nThis week you looking up and down\nyour corridor in halls... So many\npossible friends, where to start?\nYou go to your computer and code\nan algorithim that devises the most\nefficient route to take. The results\nshocks you. DIE NERD DIE!!!\nCancer\nThis week you decide to chat up\nthat hot lecturer you saw for the\nfirst time on Monday. You spend\nlectures imagining his beautiful hands\ncaressing your naked body. You bet\n80 year olds are a good fuck. Lots of\nexperience. Now you find out.\nLeo\nThis week you attend the first lecture\nof your life. It\u2019s pretty boring so you\nmindlessly fondle the girl next to you...\nShe takes! Gosh this is exciting isn\u2019t it?\nOoh below the belt... Mmm warm...\nwet... pointy? sharp? AAAAGHGH!\n\u2018It\u2019 bites your hand off.\nVirgo\nThis week, overcome by sexual\nfrustration you beat the shit out of\nthat hot girl on your course. You like\nto secretly watch her masturbate at\nnight. You find another drunk fresher\nto engage in double penetration with\nyou. You send the video to your mum.\nLibra\nThis week you\u2019re puking up your guts\nwhen a thought suddenly hits you;\ncan you create the siphon effect by\nre-directing your vomit \u2018back in\u2019. With\na bit of tubing you succeed! Hurrah for\nscience! Unfortunately your roommate\nis also excited... There\u2019s no escape...\nScorpio\nThis week you break in to Charing\nCross hospital and rape the oncology\npatients. You like them frail and bald.\nDespite getting caught in the act, you\nare let off by the Police because you\u2019re\npathetic. You love men in uniform.\nYou masturbate all the way home.\nSagittarius\nThis week a baby (yes a human baby)\nmysteriously finds its way into your\nbed and begins to double-fist you.\nEven though it\u2019s \u201ctotally not your\nfault\u201d you spend the rest of your life\nin jail, tossing salad for bald, tattooed\ngirls called Dave.\nCapricorn\nYou have heard that University is the\ntime to experiment. This week you\ntrawl local schools, picking out the hot\ngirls. You prefer younger girls, they\nare tight. Understandable. Behind a\nbush in Hyde Park you finger them.\nYou\u2019re a bad bad woman.\nAquarius\nThis week you\u2019re walking back to your\nroom from the shower when you pass\na gorgeous chap. Before you know it\nyou\u2019re being shafted to within an inch\nof your life against the wall. Then you\nwake up and realised that you passed\nout while taking a shit.\nPisces\nThis week you find a stray dog in the\nQuad. Out of the kindness of your\nheart you take him in. You name him\nBruce. After sucking Bruce off you\nthrow up all over some dumb-ass guy\nin the kitchen. He gets lairy. You stab\nhim in the fucking face.\nAunty McPickle is here to\nsolve all of your problems\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI broke up with my girlfriend just before\ncoming to university. Is there a quarantine period where it\u2019s not o.k. to get with\nother people or should I just get on with\nit already?\nYours Sincerely,\nNeed to Freak\nDear Need to Freak,\nFirst of all, don\u2019t worry, this is a very\ncommon problem. I myself had this issue in 1970 after Jimi Hendrix died, but\nthat\u2019s a different story. The most important thing is that what she doesn\u2019t know\nwon\u2019t hurt her (this truism doesn\u2019t apply to footballs to the back of the head.)\nFeel free to do whatever you like but just\ndon\u2019t shout about it on Facebook for a\ncouple of weeks/months, depending on\nthe length of your relationship. But if you\ndon\u2019t like that advice, there is a radical\nschool of thought that advises sleeping\nwith the ugliest girl you can find, video-ing it and sending it to your ex-girlfriend\nwith the words \u201cI\u2019ll sleep with anything,\nI just won\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d\nGive me a call,\nAunty McPickle\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI\u2019ve never spent more than a day at a time\naway from my boyfriend and I\u2019m really\nworried about getting depressed at uni.\nHe\u2019s going to uni in Glasgow so I\u2019ll only\nsee him every couple of weeks. What can\nI do?\nSincerely,\nStick to you like glue\nDear Stick to you like glue,\nMy automatic response is naturally to\nsuggest that you follow the course of action taken by Need to Freak. University\nis a brand new start. Cut your past ties\nand start afresh. Come on! It\u2019s Imperial,\nyou have your pick of the finest men\nthat\u2026 Well never mind. Otherwise what\nyou can do is this. When he comes to\nvisit you, smash him over the head with\none of your heavy textbooks. Then keep\nthe body under your bed. That way you\ncan be with him always\u2026.\nMorbidly,\nAunty McPickle\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nMy parents deleted my World of\nWarcraft account before I came to uni\nand told me that if I got another one,\nthey would cut off any support to me.\nWhat can I do?\nSincerely,\nI FEELLIKE RAIDINGTONIGHT\nDear I FEEL LIKE RAIDING\nTONIGHT,\nI will only say this once\u2026 GET. A.\nLIFE.\nWith disgust and contempt,\nAunty McPickle\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI have a secret fear of meeting new peo-ple. Whenever I\u2019m around people that I\ndon\u2019t know, a knot forms in my stomach and I end up regurgitating a nervous\nnonsensical (sometimes accompanied\nby the contents of said stomach). What\ncan I do during Freshers\u2019 Week to stay\ncalm and make friends?\nNervously,\nSocial Scaredy Cat\nDear Social Scaredy Cat,\nIf you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable then just\nreach for the alcohol. It doesn\u2019t really\nmatter which one, wine, vodka, beer,\nschnapps... It\u2019s all good. It\u2019ll help you\nrelax and make you more confident and\nsociable. And the best thing about alcohol (if you didn\u2019t know already) is that it\nis completely risk free... (that\u2019s why it\u2019s\nlegal right?)\nDrunkenly,\nAunty McPickle\n\n"

    "content": "in our nation\u2019s capital. Pretty\ngood 3G signal can be had across\nLondon on the whole, for those\nequipped with smartphones, modems and portable hotspots. For\nthose in need of WiFi, London just\nso happens to be one of the most\nconnected cities on the planet. Almost every coffee shop on every\ncorner offers WiFi of some sort,\nwhilst phone boxes and even some\nlampposts about the city also act\nas hotspots. Most are run by BT,\nT-mobile, the Cloud and O2, but\nhaving an account with one of\nthem normally means you can log\ninto others using a cross network\nlogin system.\nBut what if you in need of a new\ngadget? The \u2018world famous\u2019 Tottenham Court Road plays host to\nquite a few consumer electronics\nstores and even has three tube stations along it, so it\u2019s easy to get\nthere and back with your goods.\nLondon also plays host to three\nApple stores, Regent Street, Covent Garden and Westfield, should\nyou be a Mac-o-phile. There\u2019s\neven a PC World, if you absolutely\nmust, located close to college on\nHigh Street Ken.\nLondon is a fantastic place to run\naround exploring, but not all of\nit works all the time, especially\nwhen there are strikes! This is\nwhere TfL\u2019s journey planner and\ntravel updates are absolutely essential reading for all Londoners.\nWith tube, rail and bus updates to\nkeep you abreast of disruptions,\nTfl.gov.uk should be your first\nport of call before stepping out\nthe door. Smartphone users can\nget TfL apps too, most are free or\ncheap, or there\u2019s a Tfl mobile site\nfor when you\u2019re on the go. And\ndon\u2019t forget your everyday tech,\nOyster card of course, because\nthose paper tickets are getting\nmighty expensive. RFID baby!\nneedn\u2019t be lost should you have a\ngood backup.\nMonetary protection for your\ngear is also important. Being a\npublic place, nefarious types can\nget into halls, lecture theatres and\nseminar rooms and half-hitch your\nbest stuff. It happened several\ntimes when I was in your shoes\nand those who weren\u2019t insured\npaid dearly. You\u2019ll need a studen\ninsurer like Endsleigh who specialize in insurance geared up for\nstudents at reasonable rates. Some\nhalls of residence also have insurance built into the rent so check\nwith your Wardening team to get\nthe specifics. Stolen gear doesn\u2019t\nalways have to mean a wrecked\nweek, if you\u2019re covered.\nEveryone needs music at some\npoint during their studies, whether\nit\u2019s for working or rocking a party.\nThese days music is available eve-rywhere, some of it legally, quite\na lot of it not. So if you\u2019re sick of\nyour music collection, why not\ncheck out Spotify for your free\nand legal music hit.\nUsing a client available for Windows, OSX and linux, the service\nprovides 20 hours of streaming a\nmonth from a large music library\nwith artists from EMI, Sony, Universal, Warner and some other\nsmaller labels. There\u2019s the odd\nadvert between songs and ads are\ndisplayed in the program itself,\nbut if you\u2019re after music on the\ncheap you can\u2019t get much better.\nIf you\u2019re a heavy user you can\neven go with Spotify Unlimted\nfor \u00a34.99 a month or Premium for\n\u00a39.99 a month to get Spotify on\nyour phone and offline.\nOf course you\u2019re not just here in\nLondon to study, so your tech life\nshould follow you out and about\ninstructions. Your email account\ncan also be accessed using Exchange, IMAP or POP depending\non what your needs are. Snow\nLeopard users will be pleased to\nhear that Imperial runs Exchange\n2007 meaning all your Mac apps\nwork brilliantly with your college\naccount. Windows users will need\nOutlook for full interoperability\nwith calendar, contacts and email.\nIf you\u2019re out and about, your email\ncan also be got at through the\nOutlook Web Access (http://icex.\nimperial.ac.uk) in any browser,\nthough to get the non \u2018light\u2019 version you\u2019ll need Internet Explorer\n*sigh*.\nSpeaking of halls, tech doesn\u2019t\nstop at the door. Many Halls are\nkitted out with LCD TVs, games\nconsoles, DVD/Blu-ray players\nand shared computers. If you\u2019ve\ngot your own TV with you (you\ncrazy kids), don\u2019t forget you\u2019ll\n\u2018need\u2019a TV license, even for those\nwith computer TV tuner cards.\nImperial, especially South\nKensington, is a pretty benign\nplace overall, but there are a few\nthings to be aware of now that\nyou\u2019re here. A decent firewall is a\nmust and if you\u2019re a PC user, get\nyourself some anti-malware such\nas the brilliant Microsoft Security\nEssentials or Symantec which the\ncollege provides for free. If you\u2019re\nconnected to the College network\nliterally thousands of people can\nfind and compromise your computer with minimal effort, so make\nsure you use protection. After all,\nyou wouldn\u2019t want to go home to\nyour Mum with a nasty infection\nnow would you? Mac users - make\nsure you have your firewall on, by\ndefault it\u2019s off, because people\ncan still steal your stuff. Backups,\nyou probably hear this a lot, are\nthe saviour of many a poor soul.\nFrom hardware failures, acci-dents, thieves and malware, there\nare lots of cause of data loss these\nays. Irreplaceable photos of your\nroommate slumped in the corner\nwith marker pen all over his face,\nor coursework for that matter,\n8\nTECHNOLOGY\nfelix\nFRIDAY 01 OCTOBER 2010\nicex.imperial.ac.uk\nGet your Imperial email, calendar and contacts from\nanywhere on the planet with Outlook Web Access.\nImperial Technology\nSurvival Guide 2010\nAll you need to know about tech life here at Imperial\nWelcome Freshers! You\u2019ve made\nit to Imperial, a place where technology and life should go hand\nin hand. I\u2019ll leave that up to you\nto decide whether that\u2019s true, but\nhere\u2019s a quick guide to tech at college and the surrounding areas of\nLondon to see you through your\nfirst couple of weeks.\nThese days you are probably\nalready armed with some sort of\ncomputer, maybe even just a net-book. But in the unlikely event\nyou get caught short, there are\nplenty of computers scattered\naround Imperial that are free to\nuse. Armed with your IC login,\nyou have full unadulterated access\nto the Internet. Be warned that\nthere is a usage policy and ICT\nis watching, Big Brother style, as\nthose of us who have fallen foul in\nthe past can attest.\nSo where can you get at a com-puter? Well the Library has quite\na few, from the ground floor Caf\u00e9\nto the individual subject orientated floors with books (remember\nthem right?) there are clusters of\ncomputers available for use. There\nare also a few scattered outside\nthe SCR and most departments\naround college have at least one\ndedicated computer suite. Rumour\nhas it that some departments are\nbetter endowed than others (here\u2019s\nlooking at you Mech Eng), so\nif you find yourself short in one\ndepartment check out your neighbouring departments.\nOf course, Imperial has a campus wide wireless network. Imperial-WPA is the preferred connection and can be logged onto with\npretty much any modern device,\nincluding smartphones, with your\nImperial login details. Some halls\nare kitted out for WiFi, but many\nstill rely on Ethernet in rooms,\nwhich is also a great deal faster.\nWhilst using a non-college computer you can still get access to\nyour H drive by using the Home\ndirectory finder (on the Imperial\nICT website) and following the\nSamuel Gibbs\nImperial WPA\nCampus-wide WiFi is available using your Imperial\nCollege login credentials.\nNorton AntiVirus\nA free download of Norton AV for Windows or OSX is\navailable on the ICT website or via the software shop.\nMicrosoft Ultimate Steal\nStudents can buy Microsoft Office at a heavily discounted rate from www.ultimatesteal.co.uk\nICT Service Desk User Support\nOpen 9am-6pm, Mon-Fri on Level 4 Sherfield Building,\n49000 or at: www.imperial.ac.uk/ict/servicedesk\n24/7 ICT FAQ Support\nCheck out the answers to common questions at:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/ictfaq\nKeep your password safe\nICT will never ask for your password so don\u2019t give it\nto anyone.

Remember, your personal details can be used to\nget into your banking, your credit cards and email.\nBackup your data\nMake sure important files like coursework are\nbacked up or stored on your H drive.
