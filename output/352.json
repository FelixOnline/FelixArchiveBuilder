    "content": "2 FELIX22 nd January, 1974\nalters\nLETTER TO M.P. Sir,\nThis is a copy of a letter that I have sent to\nmy local MP with respect to the Rent Strike.\nI believe that this line of\napproach is more direct\nthan any line through the\ncollege authorities, and,\nif more people follow\nthis action through their\nown local M. Ps. then the\nrent strike action will\nhave some significance\nin the circles where such\nsignificance is more im-port ant, that is in Westminster.\nDear Mr. Luce,\nI am writing to you to\ninform you that the\nUnion has set up machinery for a rent strike in\nthe college and I am supporting this action. We\nbelieve that the present\ngrants- system contains\nconsiderable anomalies\nand our action aims to\ndraw attention to these\nand is in no way aimed\nto disrupt the running of\nthe college. When our\npoint is made all the\nmoney will foe re tur end to the college.\nThe anomalies are\nbriefly the wholly inadequate award given to\npostgraduate students,\nconsidering their contribution to the technological advancement of the\ncountry they are pitifully\nrewarded i for the long\nhours they work. Secondly, - married women\nstudents face considerable hardship because\ntheir husbands are usually also students and\nyet they receive little\nover half the normal\ngrant. Another group of\nstudents, or should I say\npotential students, can\nnever hope to receive\nthe degree they may deserve because of the\ntotal lack of finance at\ncolleges of further education and polytechnics.\nLastly, students relying\non parental contributions\nrarely see the full sub-sid y.I recommend the\nabolition of the means\ntest to be financed by a higher surtax.\nIn spite of the letter\nheading, my home is in\nLittlehampton, in your\nconstituency.\nYours sincerely,\nRupert Harper\nMechanical Engineering\nTHANK YOU\nSir,\nPlease forgive me for\nthe long delay in writing\nto thank all those who\ncontributed to my wonderful leaving present.\nThe hostess wagon is a great success; Pat and I don't know how we existed without it. Thank\nyou very much.\nThe only snag in\nbeing retired is loss of\ntouch with so many\nfriends in the College.\nWith all good wishes\nfor Christmas and for\n1974.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn George\nNUPE ATTACKS\nRECTC I Sir,\nMany of you will have\nread the letter signed by\nthe Rector, Sir Brian\nFlowers, in the last issue\nof Felix. Although it was\nwriten to \u2022 IC ASTM S, in my opinion it concerns all Trade Unions\nin Imperial College.\nSir Brian has instructed College officers not\nto reply to communications couched in intemperate language. How\ndoes one interpret this?\nSurely what is acceptable to some is objectionable to Others. To\nWhat extent will Sir\nBrian's instructions be\nabused by some College\nofficers? Will Trade\nUnion officers also decide to find certain letters from the management objectionable and\ndecline to reply? Could\nwe not be faced with a total breakdown in communications between\nCollege officers and Union officials? What\nwill be the reactions of\nthe rank and file Union\nmembership if this kind\nof situation does occur?\nAll these questions have\nto foe answered. Sir\nBrian states that the College does not show favour to certain sections of\nthe staff; this statement\nis incorrect. IC NUPE\nmembers have for a long\ntime complained that the\nCollege treats them as\nsecond class citizens.\nThese complaints are not\nwithout foundation. Will\nSir Brian explain why we\nlag foe hind other members of staff in holiday\nand sick benefit entitle-ment s? Sir Brian states\nthat he would be reluctant to believe that the\nASTM S membership\nsubscribes to the methods used by its officers.\nIn my experience of my\nown Branch, it is the\nrank and file 'member-ship who make the decisions; the Union officials\ncarry out the instructions\nof its members. To what\nextent we owe loyalty to\nthe College depends on\nthe treatment we receive\nfrom the college. I believe IC NUPE has\nreached a stage of reasonable relationship with\nthe Personnel Department. In my opinion Sir\nBrian's letter could destroy this.\nR. Parker\nIC NUPE Branch\nSecretary\nDEMONSTRATING\nSir,\nI am pleased to inform\nyou that the Pay Board\nhas approved the College's application for an\nincrease in the rate of\npay to part-time Student\nDemonstrators to \u00a31.15\nper hour With effect from\n7th November 1973.\nThis is the maximum increase payable under\nPhase 3 of the Government's Counter-Inflation\nPolicy.\nI have today written\nto all Heads of Departments informing them of\nthe revised rate and of\nthe effective date of im-ple ment ation. I should\nbe very grateful if you\nwould let your col\nleagues know of 'this\nchange. In the meantime\nI am sending Mr. Bowling, the Chairman of the\nMetallurgy and Mater\ni als Science Postgradu\nate Group, a copy of this\nletter in view of his earlier correspondence with\nthe Rector.\nYours sincerely,\nM.J. Davies\nCollege Secretary\nNATURAL HISTORY\nMUSEUM\nSir,\nWith effect from 2\nJanuary 1974, visitors\nWill, with certain exceptions, foe charged for\nadmission to the public\ngalleries.\nVisitors to the scientific departments and\nlibraries will foe admitted\nfree of charge. Except at\nthe Zoological Museum,\nTrlng, where different\narrangements will apply,\nthey will be directed to\nthe enquiry desk, issued\nwith a temporary pass\nand then directed to the\nperson or departmental\nenquiry point concerned.\nStudents\nStudents presenting\none of the following\nmeans of identification\nwill also be admitted to\nthe Museum free of\ncharge :\ni. a Student Ticket or\nLibrary Ticket issued by\nthe Museum;\nii. a recognised student\nidentity card (whether\nan (international stud-ent's card or one issued\nby their educational in-st it uti on, or the National\nUnion of Students);\nHi. a letter from an educational institution certifying that the holder is a student.\nG. IF. Claringbull,\nDirector\nPUBLICITY OFFICER\nSir,\nWith reference to Mr.\nSayles' suggestion in\nthe last issue of Felix,\nthat a Publications Officer be elected \"whose\njob would foe to deal\nWith the Whole realm of\npublications of the Union\":\n(1) Would he elucidate on the meaning of\n\"to deal with\" in this\ncontext,\n(2) Should such an\nofficer be appointed\nwould steps foe taken to\nsafeguard the editorial\nindependence of the\ndifferent Union publica-t ions,(3) Will he confirm\nthat any such decision\nby I.C. Union would in\nno way affect the functioning of the publications of the Constituent\nCollege Unions ?\nYours,\nA.W. Jones\n(New) Editor R.C.S. Broadsheet\nDear Mr. Jones,\nIn reply to your questions :\n1. The Publications Officer's job will be to coordinate the work of the\nvarious news organs\nwithin IC. He will be expected to be \" in the\nknow\" about everything\nwhich is happening within the Union. People\nwho publish other individual news letters, etc.,\nwill be able to draw on\nthe Publications Officer's knowledge to help with\nproducing information\nfor their newsletters.\n2. Every Union publication Would still have its\nown committee, and\nthus would maintain its\nown independence as far\nas production and con-tent. However, I feel\nthat they would be foolish if they did not utilise\nthe Publications Officer's information.\n3. Once again, the C CU publications will not be\naffected in any way by\nthe appointment of the\nPublications Officer, although I would hope\nthey would draw upon\nhis help and assistance.\nIf you would like any\nfurther clarification of\nthese answers, or have\nany comments on this\nappointment, I would be\nvery pleased to discuss\nthe matter.\nYours,\nNorm\nLast year Room at the\nTop (RATT) was opened\nto provide a number of\nfacilities for students :\nInsurance, Travel, Careers, Cheap Records,\nEnts, and Welfare. As a part of the \"Welfare\",\nthe Student Counsellor\naccepted an invitation to\nspend a couple of lunchtimes a week in RATT.\nDon Adlington, above,\nthe present Student\nCounsellor, now that he\nis \"full-time\", feels that\nhe would like to continue this scheme.\nADVICE INDEX\nThe thinking foe hind this is that Don Adlington, Who usually spends\nmost of his time seeing\nstudents in his office in\nPrinces Gardens, may\nwell foe able to offer useful information and advice on an informal basis\nin RATT, possibly on\nsubjects which students\nmight not normally think\nto see him about. For\nexample matters concerning Social Security\nand the Social Services\ngenerally: legal diff i cul ties; special accommodation or financial problems. In conjunction\nwith this, and to provide\nas comprehensive a facility as possible, a self-help index of agencies\nand organisations capable of supplying detailed advice and information on any welf ar* topic is being prepared.\nWhen finished, this directory will always foe\navailable for consultation in the RATT.\nLUNCHT1MES\nDon Adlington has\nagreed to foe in RATT\nfrom 1.00 to 2.00 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Monday and\nWednesday lunchtimes\nat the same time, Dave\nAshfoy, the union welf ar* officer, will man the\nWelfare Corner in RATT.\nThe Welfare Corner is\nthe far-left corner as on*\nenters RATT. The whole\nscheme relies, however,\non the participation of\nstudents. Even if yo\u00ab\ndon't have any problems, please come al on f for a chat and tell either\nof us What you think can\nbe done to improve rf o \u00ab\nfacilities.\nDave Ashby\nFelix, Newspaper of\nImperial College Union\nIssue No. 352\nTuesday, January 22nd Editor :\nPaul Wadsworth\nContributions and\nassistance by:\nDave Sinclair, Tariq\nLolley, Norm Sayles,\nBrian Murkin, Pete\nGreatorex\nPublished by the Editor\nfor and on behalf of\nthe Imperial College\nUnion Publications\nBoard, Imperial College\nUnion, Prince Consort\nRd., London SW72 BB.

X COUNTRY CLUB SETS NEW RECORD\nWith the race scheduled to start at 3.00 p.m. we rolled into Hayes at fifteen minutes to, on a sparkling specimen from the Green Line pre-war\nspecials after the driver had stopped en route\nto make a phone call. Not having a clue where to\ngo, the coin landed on tails so we headed in a south-westerly direction until we stumbled on a road mentioned in the instructions. On arriving\nat the Met. Police sports centre, we discovered\nthat our opponents had not decided to run against\nthemselves, and the race was delayed until 3.30.\nHowever, this was all part of the plot. Never trust\na policeman. Even Granny's computerised\n\"brain?\" failed to decipher the craftily worded\nroute, known only to the opposition. The situation was not helped by the fact that a kiddies'\nrace on the same afternoon, crossed our route\nin various places. This too, was marked by blue\nflags, which could account for the appearance\nof 4 IC runners aimlessly pounding the beat\ndown Hayes high street and arriving at the finish\nten minutes after all the others, and from the\nother direction. However, this was Pad's day. He\nwas not one of the four, which gave him his best\nfinishing position in the team since last year's bar race. J.S. really stretched out at the finish\nto come in 7th,4 places behind Bor Nosnilla.\nThe op po's plot having been an almost complete\nsuccess, the Police gained a narrow victory by\n2n points to n. R.H.A.168 HOUR\nWEEK\nFor Maureen Martin\nto look after her handicapped son Jimmy, is an\n168 hour week. Jimmy,\nwho is ten, and born\nwith neither legs nor his\nright arm, receives no\nbenefits from the Attendance Allowance Board.\nFrequent night-mares,\nthe need to be fed,\nwashed, taken to the\ntoilet and put to bed requires 24 hour attention.\nThe artificial legs on\nwhich Jimmy walks to a local junior school wear\nrapidly through his\nclothing. Recently his\nmother's main fear is\nthat if unattended, as\nthe board suggests,\nwhen crossing the road,\nthere might well be no\nfurther problems since\nthere could well be no\nmore Jimmy.\nIn spite of this, on five\nseparate occasions the\nboard has refused Jimmy partial or full bene-fits. But now three years\nof campaigning and a nationwide petition may\nlead to a private members bill in the Commons on January 23rd amending the board's practices. The bill affecting 5,000 handicapped\npersons is seeking to\namend the 1972 National Insurance Act. It\ncalls for an open hearing of all cases, the\nright to cross examine\nboard witnesses and the\nright of appeal. Sheets\nof crisp, inert, white\npaper and the oratory of\none man will support\nJimmy Martin on January 23rd. Let us hope\nthey give him more than\ntwo false legs to stand\non throughout life.\nA.Z.

Imperial College Folk\nClub is responsible for this particular piece of\ndrivel, but don't rush off now, give us a chance\nto tell you about this wonderful society.\nSingers\nWe meet every Wednesday in the Lower Refectory, at about 8.00 (well that's the official\ntime). We present a variety of acts from floor\nsingers (no that doesn't mean they're flat out\ndrunk), to a professional guest artist each week.\nMusic is mostly folk y, both traditional and contemporary but there are some notable exceptions.\nAnyone who wishes is welcome to come along\nand sing or play anything. They can sing their\nown or known songs (or both if they're that\ngood), or just play some instruments. We're very\nfriendly to floor singers really, we only laugh\nat our resident drunk. But seriously, we respect\nanyone's efforts and appreciate their participation (guess who just swallowed a dictionary!).\nWe have our own resident singer in the form of\nSteve (where's the toothpaste) Walmsley, well\nknown to anyone who has been to any folk music\nhappening at l.C Extra attraction is that we're\nonly across the hall from the bar.\nRegular folk club members come from IC, UC, IF, Bedford to mention but a few.\nArtists\nArtists who appear are usually well known in\ntheir own area of the country, but they are nearly\nall reasonably well known in this field (figuratively speaking, cos I'm really writing this in a room!). To name drop, Diz Disley, Rosie Hardman, Stan Arnold and Bob Davenport have all\nplayed here recently and of course the best Great\nHall concert of last term\u2014Ralph McTell was a folk club concert, officially (sorry Syd and Pete,\netc. who did all the work).\nMembership\nEveryone is welcome to come along on Wednesday nights\u2014keep an eye out for our posters.\nYou don't have to sing, you can just come and\nItSten and join in choruses, etc. (heavy hint here\nto members^. We have a reciprocal agreement (!)\nwith Bedford College, and any of our members\ncan attend their folk club at a reduced rate. If\nyou wish to become a folk club member (a very\nsuperior species), just turn up on any Wednesday\nevening and we'll give you a card and pinch all\nyour money\u2014No! That's wrong, membership fee\nis only 50p,I think that's all\u2014*it will have to be, because\nmy brain hurts! Please come and see us soon, at\nleast it breaks up the week, and if you don't like\nthe music, you can always laugh at the\njokes (? ? ) .\nHope to see you sometime soon.\nLuv from the Folk Club Committee.\ngo ciE Ty Imperial College Railway Society was founded by a group of railway enthusiasts at the college in 1947. Although the society has had its\n\"ups and downs\" since then, the situation at\nthe moment can be regarded as fairly representative with membership around the thirty mark\nand a full programme of fortnightly meetings\nand visits.\nMeetings\nMeetings are held once every two weeks during the Winter and Spring terms on Tuesday\nevenings starting at 17.40. This arrangement\nallows the speaker to be entertained at Hall\nDinner after the talk. The programme of meetings is carefully chosen to ensure as wide a coverage of railway subjects as possible. For\nexample, last term Mr. F.W. Briggs gave a talk entitled \"The South Eastern and Chatham\nScene\", a historical illustrated review. Earlier in\nthe term Lt. Col. Townsend-Rose of the Railway\nInspectorate came and discussed his job. Still\nto come this term is, amongst others, Mr. B.J. Prigmore on \"Tube Stock through the ages\"\nand, later on. Dr. A.0. Gilchrist Will present\n\"The Technical Background to High Speed\nTrains.\" The Society also has a reciprocal arrangement with University College Railway\nSociety allowing members to attend meetings\nthere.\nVisits\nVisits are not held in accordance with such\na rigid timetable but there are usually about five\neach term. The majority of them take place on\nWednesday afternoons but evening and weekend ones are not uncommon. The highlight of\nlast term's visits was undoubtedly that to\nCoburg St. Control for the Victoria and Northern\nLine (LTE). Plans for this term include Victoria\nsignal box (BR-SR) and the White City Training Centre (LTE). In the summer term a long-distance outing is arranged; the most recent was\nto Carlisle, the outward journey being via the\nMidlands and the return via the West Coast.\nOwn Loco\nOther points of interest relate to the Society's own steam loco and magazine: the former is a3y\" gauge loco called \"Dymphna\". Although\nheavy repairs are needed at the moment, a technician in the college is carrying them out\nand it is hoped that \"Dymphna\" will be in steam\nbefore the end of the year. The Society's magazine \"Record\" is published annually and, apart\nfrom reporting on Society activities, articles of\ngeneral railway interest are included.\nDetails\nI hope this brief article has given you some\nidea of what the Society does and should you\ndesire them further details can be obtained\nfrom the Secretary, Jonathan Edwards vis ME\n3 \"pigeonhole\". Alternatively, you can just\ncome along to a meeting\u2014you would be very\nwelcome. Details of these are given in I.C. News. P. Greatorex, Chairman ICRS\n$ & C WEEK IN THE\nLAKE DISTRICT\nWhile most of you were still stuffing Christmas goodies and feeling sick, members of the\nI.C. Scout and Guide Club, also feeling sick,\nprepared for their annual trip to the Lake District. By 9.00 a.m. on the Saturday morning,\nthe minibus was loaded and heading north.\nArrival\nAround 5.00 p.m. we arrived in Little Langdale, having picked up more people on the way.\nHere progress slowed considerably, since the\nnext two hours were spent a) finding the hut to\nsleep in, and b), finding the keys at the nearby\nfarm. Unfortunately due to error, not ours, the\nhut was being used that night.\nCosy\nAfter a night in the minibus we were feeling\nsuperbly fit to climb Helvellyn the next morn-ing. Eventually, after this exhilarating opener,\nwe found the hut. It was smaller than expected,\nbut cosy, too cosy in fact.\nMisplaced\nDuring the rest of the week much walking\nwas done, in various groups, and at various\ntimes. The Langdale Pikes, The Old Man of\nConiston, Skiddaw, the Bowfell group, and the\nFairfield group were encompassed. The weather\nvaried from good to bad, and very bad. On one\nof the latter Bowfell appeared to have been replaced by Esk Pike, or our compasses didn't function. Either way the effect was that our\nroute was not as intended.\nFuture Events\nAll too quickly it seemed it was time to come\nback, but everyone seemed to enjoy themselves\nand so could you. This term we are walking in\nNorth Wales, and Yorkshire, having a weekend\non the Broads, and also one canoeing. Come\nand see us any Thursday lunchtime 12.30\u2014\n1.30 in Mines 303. We might even let you come\nto Andorra in the summer!\nBrian Murkin, Maths II\nA.C.C. meeting\nSCR UNION 5.30\nAll tour grants to be submitted\nat this meeting\nJAN. 24\nCROSSCOUNTRY CLUB There is a legend in the Crosscountry Club that, only a few years,\nago, we were honoured to be represented by runners of such outstanding ability as to be called upon to\nrepresent their countries inter nation ally. And, as we hear at the annual\ndinner, we were the institute rs and\noft-times record holders of the\nThree Peaks Race, involving the\nascent and descent of three mountains in the Peak District. Nowadays\nthe position is that, with the Club\nat its largest for some years, there\nis a great diversity of speed; on the\none hand our Captain being summoned to run for his county, on the\nother a number plodding along at the\nback at 9 minutes a mile.\nBackground\nAs run at this college, X country\nis a unique sport. Firstly in the\nvariety of courses; differing in length\nfrom \\ \\ to 6 miles, over ploughed\nfields, roads, knee-deep mud, pasture and parkland; in straight races\nand relays. Secondly; at almost all\nraces, anyone who turns up can run.\nThirdly; it is an all weather sport;\nno amount of rain or snow (or sun-shine) or even fog has ever postponed one of our races. Lastly; the\ncompetition; we run against such\nvaried opponents as Wye College\nwith their three runners and other\nLondon Colleges, Sandhurst and the\nMet. Police, and When we run for\nU.L., where once again everyone is\nwelcome, the Navy, Oxford, Cambridge and Birmingham Universities.\nWhoever coined the phrase 'the\nloneliness of the long-distance run-ner' couldn't be more wrong, as\nthere's never any lack of people to\ntalk to (there's an old saying;\n'you're never last in cross-country').\nSocial Life\nThe social side of the club is not\nlacking, either. In fact, it tends to\novershadow the running section at\ntimes. No report of the Cross-Country Club would be complete without\nmention of the Isle of Man running\nfestival at Easter. We've been there\nfor the past 2 years now, and hope\nto go again this year.\nThe club vest is also unique; not\nonly does it bear red, yellow and\npurple diagonal stripes, it is also\noptional. Gloves are also worn.\nRaces\nMost of our races are friendlies\nagainst other colleges. We also compete in a League with other colleges\nin and around London for which\nthere are 5 races, usually with a field of about 120. Our own course\nis in Richmond Park and consists of\none lap of five and a third miles. We\nalso enter teams in the Southern\nCounties and National Championships, competing against large\nnumbers of club teams (a field of\nover 1,000 in the National Seniors).\nApart from wandering the countryside going to other people's races,\nwe also organise our own Hyde Park\nRelay, which attracts entries from\nover 80 different colleges ranging\nfrom Scotland to Germany, Spain\nand Sweden.\nFixtures are organised for every\nWednesday and Saturday afternoon\nduring the first two terms, and you\nwill be welcomed if you turn up for\nany of them, even if you can only\ncome occasionally. This applies t \u00ae\nall students at I.C. and other U.S.K. colleges, and members of staff will\nalso be welcome to join in.\n\n"

V1974 GRANTS CAMPAIGN by David Sinclair,\nDeputy President\nOn Wednesday last,\nthe NUS grants campaign 1974 was activated by a press conference given by John Randall, President, NUS. He\nstressed again the main\npoints of the campaign\nwhich is now summarised under the heading\n\"Fair grants for all stu-dents\".\nSpecifically,\nmeans\nthis\n(i) an end to the discretionary awards system whereby some students are given a grant\nfixed at the whim of\ntheir LEA. This should\nbe stopped by setting\ngrants nationally.\n(ii) an end to financial discrimination\nagainst women students\nwhereby some students\nhave their grant cut because they marry. This\nshould be stopped by ignoring marital status.\n(iii) an end to the parental contribution whereby so ime students have\ntheir grant cut because\ntheir parents do not or\ncannot contribute to\ntheir upkeep. This\nshould be stopped by\nending means testing.\n(iv) an increase in the\ngrant basic rate to \u00a3655\n(\u00a3720 for I.C. students)\nto allow for inflation.\n(v) adequate grants\nfor equipment.\n(vi) replacement of\nthe triennial review of\nBLOOD DONING\nAT I.C. The amount of blood\nused by the hospitals in\nBritain equals one transfusion for every minute\nof every day. To supply\nthis need there are approximately one-and-a half million blood don-ors. In the area covered\nby South London, Surrey, Sussex and Kent,\nthere is an urgent need\nto recruit between four\nand five thousand new\ndonors a month\u2014one\nthousand to replace existing donors Who have\nto give up being blood\ndonors for various reas-ons, and three to four\nthousand to meet Jthe\never increasing demands\nof the hospitals.\nAt the present time\nthe South London Blood\nTransfusion Centre faces\nan additional problem in\nthat the three day working week has caused the\ncancellation of blood\ndonor sessions in factories and offices. If the\nCollege can manage to\nmuster 150 donors for\neach day that the Transfusion Service's mobile\nunit will be there, it will\ngo a long way to bridging the gap between the\nsupply and the demands\nthat the hospitals are\nmaking upon us.\nThe dates of the ses-s ions, which will be\nheld in the Union Concert Hall, are: Tuesday,\nWednesday and Thursday, 29th ito 31st January (a recruiting team\nwill be present in the\nCollege from 22nd to\n25th January).\nAny queries: Ian Mc Walter, Int. 3100.\ngrant levels by an annual review based on a student cost of living\nindex.\nThe main event of the\ncampaign planned so far\nis a massive demo in\nLondon on February 8th. Over the country, students are striving to inform people of their\nplight and the necessity\nto persuade the government to accept the NUS\ngrants review 1974.\nUSK area chairman\nSonia Hochfelder, has\ngiven FELIX the following statement (slightly\nedited, removing references to coal stocks,\ncapitalist greed, etc.).\nThis term is of special importance in the\ngrants campaign since it\nis during this term that\nthe government is likely\nto make its decisions on\nthe level of the grant,\nand on who is entitled\nto one, possibly for the\nnext three years. The\nprocess of reviewing the\ngrants system and the\nincrease in the cost of\nliving, in which NUS and the Department of\nEducation <a rod Science\nhave participated, is\nnow complete and NUS\nhas submitted a claim\nfor a grant of \u00a3655 foi\nall undergraduate stud-ents, regardless of\ncourse, parental income\nor, in the case of w om en, marital status. Now\nwe have to show the\ngovernment that we are\nabsolutely determined\nto get a system of fair\ngrants for all students\nand that if this is not\nforthcoming then the\ngovernment will be faced with mass militant\naction by students\nthroughout the country.\nENANTS ASSOC.\nEXECa 0 I TEa\nThe first meeting of\nthe ICTA Executive Committee was held last\nWednesday, 16 January.\nOfficers\nAt the meeting the\nfollowing officers were\nelected: Chairman, Mr. Salisbury, Falmouth\nHall; Secretary, Mr.\nGray, Tizard Hail; Treasurer, Mr. Wadsworth,\nFalmouth Hall; Assistant\nTreasurers, Messrs. Stefanou, Fitzgerald and\nWebber, from Keogh,\nLinstead and Weeks res-pec t iv ely. There were\nno nominations for the\npost of publicity officer.\nHamlet Gardens\nThere was a discussion on the inclusion of\nthe Union flats at Hamlet\nGardens within the con-st it uti on. It was decided,\non a vote, that they\nshould not. (2 for, 8\nagainst, 2 abstentions).\nThe quorum was dropped from 200 to 150.\nThere was an addition\nin that the Executive\nCommittee may co-opt\nadditional non-voting\nmembers as they may\ndeem fit. The constitution was then passed as\nfit for presentation to the\nbank.\nSituation\nMr. Wadsworth, the\ntreasurer, reported on\nthe situation of the Rent\nStrike Fund. Forty-nine\npeople had paid to the\nfund, a total of around\n\u00a32,100. This was in\ncomparison to over 700\nhaving paid into college.\nThere were still about\n400 people who have yet\nto pay at all.\nAims\nThere was a brief\ndiscussion on the Tenants Association. There\nwas no disagreement\nwith the fact that the\nAssociation has not been\nset up solely to run the\nrent fund. It was the general opinion that the\ncommittee would and\nshould continue after\nthe rent strike has ended.\nIt was agreed that the\nquestion of an entertainments allowance for the\nHouse wardens should\nbe discussed at the next\nmeeting.\n\n"

    "content": "22nd January, 1974 FELIX ACGI UNDER ATTACK\nOf great relevance\nto Guildsmen, but also\nto other members of\nImperial College, past,\npresent and future is\nthe debate now being\nheld over (the status of\nthe Associateship of\n^he City and Guilds Institute. (A. C.G.I. \u2014\nGuilds Graduates for\nthe use of. Preferably\nafter your name).\nOriginal Structure\nOriginally, in better\ndays when the world\nwas young, poly s were\nparrots, and I.C. was a degree of silence, then\none educated one's best engineers at the\nCity and Guilds College\n(at ie as lt that hasn't changed). This establishment was governed\nby the Board of Delegacy, whose members\noom e from College, the\nClothworkers and Goldsmiths Companies and\nthe City and Guilds Institute. This board organised the financing\nand structuring of the\ncourses, and they eventually recommended\nthe awarding of the\nA. C.G. Is. to the students as they passed out\n(Which happened quite\nregularly).\nUniv. of London\n\u2022In joining I.C. and\nlater the University of\nLondon the administration of Guilds became\nthe duty of the Rector\nand Company. However the de legacy continued to operate, vetting the courses and\naccounts but they had\nlost power to make decisions other than the\nannual recommendation\nto award A. C.G. Is. It\nwas therefore the victim of a rational is ation \u2014 and has been sus-pended.\nInstead of it recommending to the Institute the awarding of\nA. C.G. Is., a list would\nperiodically arrive, on\nthe City and Guilds Institute doorstep, of the\nlatest Guilds Graduates.\nNot Known\nNow, obviously for\na body dedicated to\nthe maintenance and\nimprovement of the\nProfessional Engineering Standards, a situation whereby it is\nawarding certificates to\na group of people who\nit knows nothing about\nis intolerable. And quite rightly they have\nenquired about a change in this system.\nGuildsmen\nNow I personally regard my A. C.G.I, as\nbeing of at least equal\nvalue to my BSc(Eng)\n(both of which are\nbeing kept safe for me\nuntil I graduate, cross\nof fingers X). It marks\na Guildsman out from\nthe run of the mill ordinary Engineering Graduates. I personally\nwould welcome a participation in the structuring and examining\nof my engineering degree by the C.&G.I. and/or any other professional institution.\nSir Brian\nHowever, I am wor-ried, our present Glorious Leader, Sir Brian\nFlowers, is a bit good\nat rational ising( so I hear), and one thing\nwhich initially looks as\nif 'it needs rational ising is the Constituted College System. I personally do not want to have\nan A. I.C.(a la D.I.C.) and I trust that you feel\nthe same.\nR.L. Lolley\n(Mech Eng III)\n(Above may be chronologically and factually\nincorrect but the general situation is as\nabove).\nThe president, Norman Sayles, has received the following from\nHie College authorities:\nDear President,\nYou will be aware of\nthe recent damage to\nthe Union lift. Mr.\nShurety's memo to me\n(see later) gives a few\ndetails of this incident\nand of damage sustained by the lifts in Southside.\nIt is, of course, almost\nimpossible to find out\nwho is responsible in a College of this size but\nI do think it is most\nimportant to warn pe o ple, as widely as pos-LIFTS\nsib le, of the dangers to\nlife and limb to which\nactions give rise.\nWhere safety devices\nare by-passed (as in\nPrinces Gardens) any\nmaintenance man who\nmay be working in the\nshaft could be killed or\nseriously injured, either\nby the car or balance\nweights. Again if a landing door is opened\nWhilst the lift is elsewhere in the shaft, it is\nvery easy for somebody\nto fall into the shaft.\nOne or two fatalities a year happen in the\ncountry due to this and\nthat is why only lift\nengineers are permitted\nto open landing doors.\nCopies of Shurety's note, together with copies of our normal lift\nprocedure, are presented\nhere. If you would inform your colleagues\nand see that the widest\npossible circulation is\ngiven to this, I should\nbe most grateful. I will\nsee that the academic\nstaff and administration\n(messengers, Cleaners,\netc.) are similarly in-formed.\nYours sincerely,\nE.A. Whitehead,\nChief Maintenance\nOfficer.\nMr. Whitehead,\nFor your information\n1 write regarding the bad\ntreatment and ma!-operation suffered by\nour lift installations, particularly in areas with a majority student pop ul a tion.\nRecent Incidents\n(a) In one lift, a panel was removed\nwiring changed to\nalter destination\npoint from that indicated on panel.\nCorrected by Otis'.\n(p) The car floor selector panel removed\ncompletely by persons unknown.\nThe lift is out of ac\ntion until another\npanel is manufactured. The President\nof the Union has\nbeen informed and\nasked to co-operate\nin finding the guilty\nparty.\nEast End Princes Gardens Hall of Residence\n(a) No. 4 lift car door\ncompletely wrenched off on 18th October, 1973 resulting\nin extensive repairs\nby 'Otis'.\nThe lift was out of\naction for 4 weeks.\n(b) No. 3 lift- car door\nwas forced open\nwith lift in motion,\nas a result the car\ndoor skate lever was\nbent.\nThe lift was then\nmoved in the shaft\neither by: winding\u2014\nbrake release or\nmanual operation of\ncontroller contra c tors, this action\ncaused each landing-lock to be smashed\nby the bent lever as\nit passed.\nThe lift was out of\naction and under repair for 2 days.\nThese are just a few\nof the many incidents\nWhich constantly occur,\nsome of the Wardens\nare becoming very conscious of these happenings and doing all in\ntheir power to help resolve the problem.\nP.G. Shurety.\nCHEAP BRITISH RAIL\nAs a lot of you will\nknow by now, a scheme\nhas been arranged\nwhereby it is possible to\nobtain cheap British Rail\ntravel.\nFull - time students\naged 18-27 can now\ntravel on most British\nRail services for about\nhalf the normal fare.\nThe 50% concession is\non second class journeys\nbetween a III British Rail\nstations, but under the\nscheme there is a minimum student fare of 50p single and \u00a31.00 return.\nStudents are eligible for\nreductions of up to 25%\non some Sealink ferry\nservices.\nThe student reduction\nscheme is the result of\nnine months of negotiations between NUS Travel and British Rail and\nis being introduced for\nan experimental six month period from January 1, 1974.\nRail Card\nStudents qualify for\nthe half-price fare by\npurchasing a special\nStudent Rail Card from\nNUS Travel offices (in-clu ding the Room at the\nTop), for \u00a31.50 plus 15p VAT, total price \u00a31.65.\nProof of full-time student status and a passport photograph must\nalso be produced. The\ncard is in its own plastic\nwallet, together with a pad of ticket request\nforms. To claim the 50%\nreduction, students hand\nover a completed request\nform and show the Student Rail Card to the\nbooking clerk when they\nbuy their ticket at a British flail station in the\nnormal way.\nEligibility\nThe new scheme is\nrestricted to full-time\ncollege students aged\n18-27 inclusive \u2014 and\nexcludes students under\n18, school students over\n18, part-time students,\nstudent nurses and foreign students visiting\nthe UK on holiday.\nIn his letter to British\nRa iI accepting the scheme, NUS Travel's Marketing Manager, Paul\nConnellan, voiced his\ndissatisfaction with these eligibility rest ric tion's. \"Although we are pleased to see the\nsCheme finally in opera-tion\", the wrote, \"we\nhave very serious reservations both about the\nage restrictions, upper\nand tower, and the exclusion of student nurses and we will be\nwriting to you further on\nthis matter when our\nBoard have had a chance\nto give a considered\nreply. At this stage, I would only add that I think you are making a great deal of extra problems for yourselves in\nincurring the wrath of so\nmany students\".\nProtest\nAn immediate protest\nagainst the principle of\ncheaper rail fares for\nstudents came from Mr.\nJohn Stokes, Conservative M.P. for Oldbury\nand Halesowen. He said:\n\"I think that it is absurd\nthat students belong to a union at all. They are not\nemployees which is the\npoint of unions. They\nare absurdly pretentious,\npompous, tiresome and\ntotally unrepresentative\nof the majority of students \u2014 they tend to\nattract the activists!\"\nRestrictions\nCertain specific trains\nare excluded from the\nhalf-price student fare\nscheme. These include\ncommuter services to\nand from London, some\nInter-City services (main-ly those which would\nnormally be full, i.e. rush-hour, main weekend outgoing s and re-turns), and trains from\nScotland on various holiday dates. Full details of\nall trains on which the\nStudent Rail Card cannot be used are attached\nto the pad of ticket request forms which is\nissued with the card.\nFurther details of the\nrestrictions can be obtained from the Room at\nthe Top where the NUS\nTravel Service man a counter between 10.00\nand 15.00, Mondays to\nFridays.\nPrinted here is a photo from the Felix\nfiles.

    "content": "8 FELIX22 nd January, 1974\nAS IT WAS\nA new regular feature of excerpts from Felixes\nof 5, 10, 15 and 20 years ago. Read carefully, as\nsome topics are still around today.\n22 Jan. 1954\nViewpoint\nThose of you with eyes must have noticed that\nthe Union has undergone a considerable face-lifting. Its walls and ceilings are brighter, its floor\nc|ea ner \u2014 and going to be kept clean. So far, so\ngood. Now for the criticism.\nSlovenliness\nThe Lounge is nice, warm and quiet (except during lunchtime and Hop nights) where one can sit\nin casual comfort. This casualness, I feel, has\ngone a bit too far recently, amounting to downright slovenliness. Glasses and teacups on the\nfloor, ashtrays below the settees, ash and matches\nstrewn all over the floor and tables, newspapers on\nthe seats. WHY do we have to drop our paper\nwhen we get up. Is it too much effort to place them\non the side tables?\nMaids\nThe rest of the union comes in for the same\ntreatment, muddy feet ignore the door-mats. This\nsort of treatment is not deserving of the Union.\nIt might be all right in one's own digs visited\nperhaps by a maid once a week and by the landlady once a month, or when she smells kipper oil.\nBut please not in the Union, which is used by hundreds of others.\nRefectory News\nIt has been running at a loss for almost as long\nas anyone can remember, and three years ago\nexcessively large annual losses\u2014\u00a35,000 and more\n\u2014brought John Gardner & Co. to cut them down.\nThis they managed to a certain extent, cutting the\nlosses by ab put40%. The cut was brought about\npartly no doubt by improved efficiency and economy, but partly too by a reduction in the total\nnumber of meals served.\nMr. Mooney\nThe contract with Messrs. Gardner was terminated on Dec. 23rd and Mr. Mooney is the new\nmanager. A great improvement was noticed last\nterm in the quality and value of the food being\nserved, and it is hoped that the new manager will\ncontinue the improvement. An increase in prices\nat this time would be disastrous, and can only\nresult in a further drop in the number of meals\nserved.\nSilwood\nThe possibility of supplies to the refectory from\nSilwood Park has been studied in great detail by\nthe Refectory Committee. The primary aim was to\nprovide vegetables, but it was found that by itself\nthis will not be very lucrative. Coupled with live-stock, however, the scheme can be worked very\nprofitably, and would supply, besides vegetables,\neggs, pork, bacon, and chicken. The difficulty lies\nin the large initial outlay that will be involved \u00bb'n getting 45 acres under cultivation.\nGrants\nThe financial stability of the average student today is conspicuous, as they say, by its absence.\nToo often, alas, it is the case of \"Can I touch you\nfor five bob, old sock?\" and \"Might manage half a crown. Jack\". This fluid state of affairs, with a string of people borrowing from each other, often\ngoing round in circles, is too unstable.\nIn The Union\nFRl., FEB 1 TR OGG S50p FRl., Feb. 8\nSutherland\nBrothers & Quiver\n40p30 Jan. 1959\nGuilds to join NUS\nAt a Guilds Union meeting, it was proposed that\n\" C&G\" Union should become affiliated to the\nNUS\". Due to constitutional wrangling, however,\nthe motion was withdrawn.\nIll-mannered\nThree years ago I was under the impression that\non entering college l would be mixing with the\ncream of British youth, intelligent, educated and\ngood mannered. But this was a false impression.\nI.C. students have proved to be the most ill mannered louts I have yet come across, using filthy\nobscene language with no regard as to who is pre-sent. It is not clever to be able to swear, to be obscene or to be down right rude even less so When\nyoung ladies are present, I am ashamed to introduce people to the College. How much longer is\nthis disgusting behaviour to continue.\n22 Jan. 1964\nStruggle for power\nCollege Union and the Imperial College Halls\nare the most suitable for the students of Imperial\nCollege. This is obvious to anyone with his eyes\nopen, but among the penthouse dwellers in South\nSide, there are men who would change this and\nprovide a system based on Oxbridge, where sport\nand social activities would centre round each individual hall of residence. Each hall would have its\nown boating club and its debating society, and\neach warden would have much more power. Our\nunion exists solely for the purpose Of the students\nof Imperial College and we are the people to run it\nas we see fit. Each year the penthouse dwellers try\ntheir tactics on a new President and Council and\neach year so far they have been thwarted. Let us\nhope this situation will continue, because otherwise our Union will become a replica of UL U, where the warden does as he likes and the Union\nis converted into flats for his convenience.\nRachmanism\nIt has been brought to the notice of the College\nAdministration that there are certain persons operating in the London area who try to induce prospective tenants of property to part with considerable sums of money for rent in advance or as deposits against damages and dilapidation s. Thereafter tenants have been unable to contact the socalled landlords and obtain a refund of these de-posits.\nMembers of the college who are seeking accommodation, and who are asked to part with sum in\ncash before any tenancy is entered into, are advised to contact either their solicitors or the Establishments Officer before paying over any sums or\nsigning any documents.\nJazz News\nInspired by their successes in the ULU Jazz\nCompetition in December. The Jazz Club started a series of South Side Stomps last Wednesday.\nMore than 250 people feeling the need for a spring\nfling made the scene, served hot by the Kensington\nCity Stompers and cool by the Clive Heath Quartet.\nCommunism\nThe Communist Society in its first year ot existence has run the first ever Marxist Week in this\ncollege. Two thousand leaflets and over 200 posters advertised a series of meetings intended to\nshow how the Marxist holds the key to many ques-t ions, political, economic and cultural, by not\nmerely asking How? but Why? Why do people\ncompete instead of co-operate, produce great\nworks of art and run countries?\nIn The Great Hall\nSAT., JAN. 26 8.00 p.m. HORS LIPS+ RAB NOAKES\nI.C.

    "content": "22nd January, 1974 FELIX7 O UNC IL Sir,I am a member of Imperial College Union and,\nalthough not holding a Union post, I attended\nthe 178th meeting of\nCouncil held on Monday\nthe 14th. Any member of\nthe Union may do this,\nalthough he or she will\nonly be a spectator with\nno voice or vote.\nCouncil is formed of\nforty-six members who\nare defined as in the\nBlue Book (pages 10, 11,\n12). These are to run the\nUnion genera My and to\nact upon the decisions of\nI.C.U. G.M.' s. ARGUMENTS The meeting opened\naround 6.00 p.m. and\nclosed five hours later\n(with a twenty minute\nbreak) still not having\nfinished the agenda for\nthe meeting. The reason\nfor this I believe is the\ntime-wasting flippant and\nunnecessary verbal squabbles between certain people (or even fac-t ions) within Council.\nWhilst acknowledging\nthat the President, Deputy President and Honorary Secretary try to\nkeep order it would\nappear at times to be the\nperson who shouts longest for his opinion who\n'wins'. There is discussion upon topics as set\nby the agenda as indeed\nthere ought to be, however when certain persons 'lose' an argument\nthey perhaps act with\nless responsibility than\nthey should by muttering\nstrange oaths instead of\nlosing gracefully. A majority of members of\nCouncil do try to keep\nthe meeting running-rea-son ably as any similar\nmeeting should, however\nthe small minority, as\never, argue the toss over\na point and the subject\nbecomes bogged down.\nFinally when a 'move to\na vote' is heard someone\ninsists on getting his 'last\nsay in (again).\nEven with a vote being\ntaken this is subject to\narguments, for example\none motion was subject\nto a vote, then a re-vote\n(at this point a member\nreturned from the Union\nBar), halfway through\nthe re-vote some members did not understand\nthe voting system still\nand the Hon. Sec. had to\nexplain the voting s ys tem. Thus after five minutes the re-vote was at\nlast obtained even after\nsome members were told\nto wake up and 'sticky er and up'. CONDUCT\nI fear that certain\npeople are not taking the\nconduct of the meeting\nseriously enough, to give\nan example the Union\nFinance Committee recommends how to spend\nthe \u00a350,000 it receives\nfrom various sources\n(see Blue Book, P7), and\nmakes its recommendations to Council who\nthen approve (or not)\nthis expenditure. (This\nbeing subject to\nICUMGs see P73 section 11). This vast (?)\namount of money bandied around by a council\nwho to quote a member\n'I wouldn't even trust to\nput two lumps of sugar\nin a cup of tea,' seems a serious enough topic to\nbe discussed with commonsense and order. I was informed that this\nmeeting was mild compared with some, so\nwhat the heated ones are\nlike I dread to think.\nThere seemed to be an\nopinion that Council, because of its size was\nrather unwieldy,it should\nbe cut down to a 'more\nreasonable size'. I couldn't foresee any\nCouncil member giving\nup their Council membership 'just like that'. Paul\nWadsworth has estimated 28 as possible with\nfurther reductions at the\nexpense of Dep. Reps,\nbut is 28 going to be a success? It only needs\nthree or four people to\ndisrupt the smooth running of the meeting by\nirrelevant verbal graffiti\nand an unco-operative\nattitude to reduce that\nmeeting to one which is\nbetter adjourned. Representation of about four\nthousand students by 28\npeople may not be truly\nso. Surely 46 is a better\nnumber if these 46 are\naware of the troubles of\nunruly meetings, e.g. the\npostponement of items\nwhich were outstanding\nto the next Council meeting as with U.G. M.'s. APATHY\nStudents at I.C. seem\nto be very apathetic with\nregard to the four college unions especially\nI.C.U. which after all is\nthe most powerful theo-ret ical ly.I recognise that\na lot (most?) of you are\nhere for the work and\nsubsequent first class\nhonours but I think that\nyou should make an\neffort to attend any\nunion meeting be it\nI.C.U., R.C.S. U.,C. G.U., or R. S.M.U. They may\nappear to be boring and\nconcerned with 'trivia' of\nno relevance (seemingly)\nto an I.C. student, for\ninstance Chiile. It'sal ii been said before, but do\nyou want a union that is\nrepresenting the majority\nview of students or an\nextension of I.M.G., or\nY. S.S.S. or Whatever?\nAre you concerned with\nthe public image of student unions or are you a member of Apsoc? The\nI.C.U. G.M. s take place\non Thursdays (when\nthere are General Studies\nlectures from 1.30 to\n2.30 p.m.) and may last\nup to H hours, which\nisn't very much out of\nthe work timetable. The\nsame applies to C. C.U. meetings which take\nplace on Tuesdays.\nCHAIRMAN\nMeanwhile back on\nthe hobbyhorse I am still\ndiscoursing upon Council. I would suggest that\nthe chairman imposes a stricter authority upon\nthese (approximately:)\nmonthly meetings. Members going to the Union\nBar or the 4U2P( what-ever that stands for!)\ncreate a disruption both\nin their journey and from\nan excess of hot air\nwhilst arguing. Perhaps\nthe visits to the 4U2P must be allowed but the\ntwo or three clanking\npots with 'Tankard',\n'Guinness', and 'Whit-bread' interrupting general discussion should be\nbanned until half time,\nalthough members be\nallowed to stock up beforehand (or nothing\nwould be done!).\nMembers should realise that they are not\nthere to count the cobwebs in the corner, the\nmeetings will surely be\nover more quickly if the\ngeneral level of order is\nraised. I believe Paul\nWadsworth would like to\nsee meetings over more\nquickly especially as he\ndoes a lot of the pen-pushing donkey work.\nNo doubt the Union\nclerk, taking the minutes,\nwould like to hear the\ngentleman in the far corner more Clearly. A meeting will become\nboring if one person decides to have more than\nhis fair share of time\nand not accept the authority of the chair.\nUNION'S VIEWS\nCouncil could easily\nbecome 'pie in the sky'\nif lit does not know the\nviews of I.C.U. members\nwhether expressed at\nU.G. M.s or just talking\nto Norm. Paul and Dave\nin the Union Office or the\nBar etc. The Union is for\nits members but if its\nofficials don't know the\nviews of its members\nthe Union becomes the\n'puppet' of a minority\ngroup who do come t \u00ae\nU.G. M.'s. Felix is your\nnewspaper so write a letter or tell Aunt Lucy\nyour problem or tell Paul\nto resign because he\nhasn't forced the Tories\nto resign and returned a Labour government pledged to socialist poli-cie s. Come to I.C.U. office and tell Norm, or\nPaul your views on some-thing, resign from Apsoc.\nD. Salisbury, Physics 1\nThese are excerpts from the draft minutes of the Union\nCouncil Meeting held on Monday 14th January 1974\nDonations\nAt the previous Council, they agreed to donate \u00a3 1 0 towards a Christmas Box for the Harlington Groundsman, Mr. A. Loveday. \u00a35 was also\ndonated to a similar present for Mr. Newens, the\nCollege Waterman, this\nto be added to a whip\nround from the boat club.\nFor his work in producing Felix whilst the\nprevious editor was at\nthe NUS conference, Mr.\nWrigley was paid \u00a3 1 0 to\ncover expenses incurred.\nUnion Constitution'\nMr. Wadsworth reported that help was still required in the rewriting of\nthe Union constitution.\nWellsoc Synthesiser\nA representative from\nthe Wellsoc electronic\nmusic group was again\npresent to put forward a case for an electronic\nsynthesis er. After considerable discussion on\nthe various alternatives it\nwas agreed that \u00a3200\nshould be given to S CC to extend to Wellsoc electronic music group so\nthat they could hire a synthesis er. Union Meetings\nMr. Sedgwick, floor\nrep, proposed a motion\npertaining to the running\nand holding of Union\nMeetings. Its objects\nwere to limit the number\nheld, the topics dic us sed, and to automatically have the quorum\nchallenged When the\nmeeting is in quo rate. There was again considerable discussion on this\ntopic. When the vote was\ntaken the proposals were\n(defeated.\nUnion Pots\nFollowing are com im end ation from Mr.\nBlack it was agreed that,\nin future, registration\ncards or union cards\nshould be exchanged for\nUnion pots so that they\ndon't \"disappear\". The\ncard would be returned\non the safe return of the\npot. This is to be implemented at the discretion\nof the bar staff.\nQuestionnaire\nIt was agreed that help\nshould be given to the\npublishers of an Alternative Guide to Universities and Polytechnics being produced by Wildwood House Publishers.\n\u00a350 would be charged\nfor the service, however,\nand a request would be\nmade for 150 questionnaires instead of the 25\nthat they were going to\nsend.\nMalaya\nThere was a representative from the Committee for \\ Democratic\nRights in Malaya. He\nasked us to support the\nmagazine \"Truth\" that is\nproduced in Malaya and\nalso to support freedom\nof the press in Malaya.\nCouncil agreed to write\nto the campaign board\nfor the committee expressing our support and\nalso to the Malayan Government expressing our\nsupport for the right of\nfreedom of the press and\nfree speech.\nDyslexia\nCouncil agreed to donate \u00a3 1 0 to the North\nLondon Dyslexia Association.\nOpen University\nThe Union council decided that our facilities\nshould be extended to\nmembers of the Open\nUniversity Students' Association.\nGrants\nDemonstration\nThere was an announcement that there\nwould be a national\ngrants demonstration on\nFebruary 8. As many\nstudents as possible will\nbe accommodated in the\nUnion building over the\nevening of the 8th.. Departmental representatives are expected to help\nwith the publicity for the\ncampaign.\nCampaign Press\nConference\nMr. Sinclair will attend\nthe press conference to\nbe held on Wednesday,\n16 January.\nFelix\nMr. Wadsworth asked\nfor help with the distribution of Felix. There\nwas some disagreement\nas to which method\nought to be used. It was\nfinally left in the hands\nof Mr. Wadsworth to de-cide.\nFinance\n\u00a31,770 had already\nbeen spent on Felix and\nit was very likely that it\nwould greatly exceed its\nbudget. Mr. Wadsworth\nreported that the legal\ncase against University\nPress Representation\nwas now under way\nagain. They have admitted liability to around\n\u00a3 5 0 0 but we are claiming \u00a31,000 plus.\nCouncil approved\nUnion Finance's Recommendation that 1) \u00a3 5 0\nbe spent on a reception\nfor a group of 100\nFrench students who are\nvisiting the college in\nMarch. 2) \u00a32,500 should\nbe spent on the renovation of the chairs in the\nSouthside lower lounge,\n3) work on the organisation of the removal of\nthe Southside television\nset to the Health Centra\nshould proceed. It was\nagreed that up to \u00a3297\nshould be spent on the\npurchase of a set of oars\nfor the women's boat\nclub,but that they should\nlook into the possibility\nof obtaining a secondhand set at a cheaper\nrate.\nThere was a heated\ndiscussion on the pre si dent's proposal that the\nUnion should give the\nStudent House wardens\na sum of \u00a3400 between\nthem to bring the amount\nof entertainments allowance up to \u00a32 per student per year in each\nhouse. It appeared that\nthe college were unable\nto raise the allowance by\nmore than \u00a35 as they\nclaim that it would be in\ndefiance of the govern-ment's phase 3 regulations. Council, however,\ndefeated the proposal\n(15 against, 13 for and\n5 abstentions). The purChase of new light-ex-clu ding curtains for the\nbilliards and snooker\nroom was not approved.\nElections\nMessrs. Black, Roberts and Gorman were\nelected as representatives to the ICTA Executive\nCommittee.\nThe meeting closed\nwithout considering any\nother business or reports\nas the guillotine had\nbeen reached, and, on a vote, it was not sus pen ded.\n\n"
