    "content": "10 FRIDAY 14 FEB\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nSomething else worth swallowing\nChristopher Yates talks about the new drug touted as a female viagra\nIMguR\nBouncing back: new research supports rebound sex\nkeir Little\nScience Editor\nThe preferred option for some females rebounding at Imperial\nD\nubbed \u2018Female Viagra\u2019,\nthe drug Lady Prelox has\ngone on sale in the UK\nthis week, marketed as\nbeing \u2018clinically proven\u2019\nto improve female sexual dysfunction.\nWhether or not it works is another\nmatter.\nDespite the marketing, Lady Prelox\nis not related to Viagra, but is a new\nversion of Prelox, a combination of\nL-arginine and a pine bark extract\ncalled pycnogenol. Prelox has been\nused to treat erectile dysfunction (ED)\nand has shown some efectiveness.\nhe main diferences between the\nmale and female version of Prelox\nare a lower dose of L-arginine and\nthe colour of the pills \u2013 in a stunning\ndisplay of gender stereotyping, Lady\nPrelox is pink and Prelox is blue.\nBlood low to the penis is the\ndriving force behind an erection. To\nincrease low, blood vessels within\nthe penis dilate, allowing more blood\nin. his vasodilatation is due to the\naction of nitric oxide (NO), which is\nproduced from L-arginine. Viagra\nworks downstream of NO by blocking\nthe efects of an enzyme that switches\nof the pathway turned on by NO.\nL-arginine supplements have been\nshown to improve the symptoms\nof ED, but in a weak and highly\ndose-dependent way. Assuming\nvasodilatation is important for female\nsexual function, the lower dose\npresent in Lady Prelox (200 mg versus\n700 mg) could render it less efective.\nhe other ingredient in Prelox,\npycnogenol, stimulates e-NOS, the\nenzyme responsible for producing\nNO from L-arginine. his leads\nto a synergistic efect between the\ntwo ingredients, with pycnogenol\nincreasing the activity of e-NOS and\nthe L-arginine giving the enzyme the\nsubstrate it needs. In a very small\n(21 people) clinical trial, there is an\nimprovement in male sexual function\ncompared to placebo, measured by\nresponses to a questionnaire.\nUnfortunately, this trial and all\nothers investigating the efects of\nPrelox on ED have been small in\nsize (under 50 patients). Some of the\ntrials did not compare the efects of\nPrelox to anything else, meaning the\nimprovement could simply be thanks\nto the placebo efect.\nIn a clinical trial of Lady Prelox on\n100 women aged 37-45, all patients\nwere given a management plan,\nconsisting of changes to lifestyle, diet,\nexercise and stress control. Half the\nwomen were also given Lady Prelox.\nBoth groups showed increased sexual\nfunction, with a larger increase in the\ngroup taking Prelox. As the control\ngroup were not given anything in\nplace of Prelox, this diference could\nonce again simply be down to the\nplacebo efect.\nAnother trial, on post-menopausal\nwomen, gave an improvement in\nsexual function compared to placebo.\nH o w e v e r,\nthis trial\nwas only\ns i n g l e -b l i n d ,\nm e a n i n g\nthat whilst\nthe patients\ndid not\nknow which\ntreatment\nthey were\ng e t t i n g ,\nthe doctors\nrunning the\ntrial did.\nNot only\nthat, but\nunlike the\ncauses of\nmale ED,\nthe causes\nof female\ns e x u a l\ndysfunction\nare unclear.\nWhilst there is an increase in genital\nblood low during arousal, whether\nimproving this low leads to an\nimprovement in sexual function is not\nknown.\nIf sexual dysfunction is\npsychological, improving blood low\nwill not help. Prelox, like Viagra,\nrequires the user to be aroused and\nso as Dr Graham Jackson, chairman\nof the Sexual Advice Association, told\nthe Daily Mail, \u201cif you\u2019re not turned on\nby your partner, no amount of tablets\nwill help.\u201d\nhe results of the trials of this\nsupplement have been covered in\nthe Daily Mail, the Telegraph, and on\nwebsites around the world. As with\nmany science articles in the news,\nthere is an acceptance of the results\nof the clinical trials without critically\nappraising the methods. his problem\nis by no means unique to this pill or\nthese articles, which do point out\nI\nt\u2019s oicial: the popular belief that\npeople who have been dumped\nare more likely to have \u201crebound\u201d\nsex is true, at least among\nstudents.\nLynne Cooper and Lindsey Barber\nat the University of Missouri followed\nthe lives of 170 undergraduates who\nhad recently been through a break-up, asking them to keep a diary of\ntheir feelings, sexual experiences and\nmotivations over a period of twelve\nweeks.\nhey found that within four weeks of\nthe break-up, one third of participants\nhad sex, with 35% claiming it was to\nget over their previous relationship\nand 25% claiming it was a form of\nrevenge.\nhough there are many common\nperceptions about rebound sex \u2013 with\ntomorrow, the day after Valentine\u2019s\nDay, being considered \u201crebound day\u201d\naccording to Urban Dictionary \u2013 there\nhad been scant previous research into\nthis behaviour.\nhe study also found that people\nwho had been dumped were more\nlikely to have sex than those who\ninitiated the break-up, and more\ncommonly said that they used sex as\na coping mechanism. hese people\nalso sufered more distress. \u201cPeople\nreally do use sex as a way to get over\nor get back at their ex-partner in the\naftermath of a breakup,\u201d said Lynne\nCooper.\nhe frequency of rebound sex\nlevelled of over time: ive months after\nthe break-up, dumped participants\nwere no more likely to\nuse sex to cope than their\nformer partner; however,\nthose who did have sex\nas a coping mechanism\nimmediately after the\nbreak-up were more likely\nto have sex with strangers\nfor a longer period.\nhe study claims that\n\u201cpeople are more likely to\nhave sex for a variety of\nmaladaptive reasons in the\naftermath of a romantic\nrelationship breakup\nespecially if they were\n\u201cdumped\u201d or were in a\nhighly committed or longstanding relationship.\u201d\n\u201c[his] data provides\nclear support for common\nrebound lore, suggesting that people\ndo indeed use sex in the aftermath of a\nbreakup to help them cope with their\nfeelings of distress and to get over or\nget back at their ex-partners.\u201d\nDOI: 10.1007/s10508-013-0200-3\nthat the biology behind female sexual\ndysfunction is still unclear.\nOverall, this supplement seems to\nbe a weaker, pink version of a pill that\nmay help treat erectile dysfunction,\nbeing marketed to treat something\nwith an unknown biological basis in\nwomen based on two small, unreliable\nclinical trials. If you\u2019d like some, it\ncosts \u00a337.95 for a month\u2019s supply, and\nget in touch with Felix Science, as we\nwould love to hear all about it.\nSTaTIC2.STuFF.Co.Nz\n\n"

Contact us now!\nWith less than 3 months left of the sea-son, James White predicts where each\nof the 20 Barclays Premier League\nteams can expect to inish.\nArsenal \u2013 heir drubbing at Anield\naside, the Gunners have so far managed to avoid their usual post-Christ-mas slump. But they have a horriic\nrun of ixtures ahead and often fall\nshort in matches against direct title\nrivals. 3rd\nAston Villa \u2013 Although relatively\nyoung and inexperienced, the Villans\nhave an astute manager in Paul Lambert. Unlike most relegation candi-dates, they have the guile to beat any\nside on their day. 10th\nCardif \u2013 Dispensing of Malky Mackay\u2019s services was a big mistake. Ol\u2019\nGunnar Solskjaer has no experience of\na relegation battle and the Bluebirds\nlook very short up front. 20th\nChelsea \u2013 he competition is ierce\nthis year and they lack a reliable out-and-out striker to inish sides of, but\nJose Mourinho has won a title or two\nin his time and the Blues are my favourites for the title. 1st\nCrystal Palace \u2013 Tony Pulis has steadied the ship and transformed Palace\u2019s\ndefence. hey are short up front but\nknow how to grind out a 1-0 win at\nhome when they need to and should\nbe more than OK. 14th\nEverton \u2013 Roberto Martinez has surpassed all expectations since taking\nover at Goodison Park but the Tofees\nhave looked distinctly beatable in recent weeks and are probably slightly\noverachieving. 7th\nFulham \u2013 he Cottagers look like a\nSunday league side at times. here\nmay be the old heads needed to handle a relegation battle but barring their\ndraw at Old Traford, recent performances suggest a desperate shortage\nof quality. 19th\nHull \u2013 Steve Bruce\u2019s Tigers have deserved to stay clear of the relegation\nplaces so far, but it will be a tall order\nfor them to keep it up for 11 more\ngames. hey are in for a nervy inish\nbut should just have enough to sur-vive. 17th\nLiverpool \u2013 With Luis Suarez and\nDaniel Sturridge iring on all cylin-ders, and astute, level-headed Brendan\nRodgers at the helm, the Reds are\ninally equipped to make their long-awaited return to the top four. 4th\nMan City \u2013 Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side\npossess one of the most potent attacks\nin Europe but still have questions to\nanswer defensively. Although their recent form is doubtless just a blip, they\ncannot aford it and may have to settle\nfor a runners up spot. 2nd\nMan United \u2013 Teams play the Red\nDevils expecting to get a result, so\nDavid Moyes is up against it in every\ngame. Even with van Persie and Rooney back in contention, I think they\nmight just fall short of Europe. 6th\nNewcastle \u2013 It is just as well for the\nMagpies that they are 10 points clear\nof the bottom half as they have nothing left to play for this season and\nfor that reason will probably not win\nmany more games. 9th\nNorwich \u2013 Chris Hughton always\nmanages to get a result when he needs\nit, but the Canaries are joint second\nlowest scorers in the division and\nshort of quality. heir run-in is hor-riic and this will go down to the wire.\n18th\nSouthampton \u2013 Although like Newcastle, the Saints have nothing to play\nfor in the league, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side enjoy their football, playing\nwith real lair, and can climb up a place\nor two. 8th\nStoke \u2013 he Potters will be alright as\nthe Britannia Stadium remains a hard\nplace to visit, although their away\nform is dismal and they are struggling\nto adapt to Mark Hughes\u2019 more free-lowing style. 12th\nSunderland \u2013 It is diicult to fault the\nBlack Cats\u2019 performances and in Gus\nPoyet they have a manager who will\nnever lie down. Strong both at home\nand away of late, I fancy them to inish\nwell clear of the drop. 11th\nSwansea \u2013 Michael Laudrup\u2019s sacking sums up a miserable season so\nfar. hey lack a cutting edge but judging by their win versus Cardif, Garry\nMonk has the players\u2019 respect so they\nshould be ine. 13th\nTottenham \u2013 Spurs look set to push\nthe sides above them for a Champions\nLeague spot, and I expect Tim Sherwood to keep up his strong start, but\nthey are not proliic enough at home\nand may have to settle for the Europa\nLeague again. 5th\nWest Brom \u2013 Pepe Mel\u2019s Baggies have\nalready picked up solid draws against\nLiverpool and Everton and although\nthey seldom win, they have the quality\nto keep nicking points here and there\nso should survive. 16th\nWest Ham \u2013 Credit to Sam Allardyce\nthat the Hammers are not rock bottom given the horriic run of injuries\nhe has had. Big Sam knows how to win\na relegation tussle and has big players\nreturning all the time. 15th\nAfter a long series of consecutive\ntriumphs over a bunch of teams of\nabsolutely negligible importance\n(amongst which was our own 1s),\nImperial 2nd XI took on a group\nof amateur medical students who\nsometimes get together and pretend\nto know how to play football. Long\nstory short, it turns out King\u2019s is\nactually a real university and has a real\nfootball team.\nhe view of 11 red-shirted herculean\nmen shrugging the chilly British rain\nof their shoulders was almost enough\nfor the wannabe jobless surgeons to\nchange their mind about the game. It\ntook them about an hour and a half\nto stop shaking in terror and actually\nshow up on the pitch.\nWith a lovely wind blowing on our\nbacks we kick of, a leet of Airborne\nRangers handling balls better than\nWill Batchelor\u2019s belt. After 15\nminutes in which the biggest danger\nin Imperial\u2019s half was a gust of wind\nmessing up Sam homas\u2019 hair, the\nwell-deserved irst goal on the game\narrived from none other than Mic\nTonutti\u2019s magical left foot: lying like\na hawk on Maizonnier\u2019s low corner, a\nlick with the tip of the foot from the\nfront post left the keeper seriously\nconsidering a career in low-proile\nprostitution. After a few more minutes\nof champagne football, Will Wilson\nfound the bottom corner from outside\nthe box, taking advantage of a hole in\nKing\u2019s defence as easy to wade into as\nour beloved yanks every Wednesday\nnight. 2-0 wasn\u2019t enough though;\nafter a few unrealistic attempts at\npenetrating the fortress of Imperial\u2019s\ndefence, another masterpiece from\nthe best Italian left back since Fabio\nGrosso in the 2006 World Cup led to\nan unassailable lead. A lucky save on\nMiles Cover\u2019s header allowed Tonutti\nto release a light-speed bullet right\nbelow the crossbar. 3-0 at halftime,\njust as King\u2019s ginger striker started\nlooking for his self-esteem in the ield\nacross the road.\nIn the second half, Imperial\u2019s best\nteam perfectly controlled the game,\nwith no danger seen around Sam\nMason\u2019s goal. A strong drive from 25\nyards by Andy SB left the base of the\npost shaking, much like the linesmen\nin these terrible conditions. Tactics\nchanged rapidly, with the aim being to\nstretch the pitch and get the wingers\u2019\nboots as white as Smithy\u2019s wallet.\nIC saw out the game in comfortable\nfashion, creating chances on the\ncounter as they wished and laughing\nat how useless the opposition were.\nMic Tonutti\nIC Football\nImperial 2nd XI stroll past\n\u201cwannabes\u201d from KCL\nJames White\nFootball Columnist\nCries of \u201cWho is this person?!\u201d were\naimed at their star players, who could\nonly responded with \u201cI broke my back.\nMy back\u2026 is broken.\u201d\nNormal service has been resumed\nat Fortress H this term, helping the\n2s extend their winning streak to\n4 games. On this glorious road of\nvictories, 16 goals have been scored,\na single goal conceded and Scatman\nhas reigned supreme in the changing\nroom. Victory was celebrated under a\nrelentless rain of Americans and beer,\nwith a late title surge taking shape. Bebah-bah-bada-bom!!!\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\\\nImperial Eagles celebrate\ndouble against Middlesex\nT\nhe Eagles started where\nthey left of and extended\ntheir unbeaten run in the\nLondon University Sports\nLeague with 2 victories\nagainst Middlesex.\nhe ixture in January was the irst\nmatch for IC after the holidays, and\nthe performance was everything but\nencouraging. Sloppy passing, passive\ndefending and careless individual\nerrors meant that the Eagles were\nunable to adhere to their game-plan.\nVery rarely were the players on the\nback position allowed to co-ordinate\ntheir eforts in attack, and some\nrather unconventional attacking by\nMiddlesex, paired with a big portion of\nluck, continuously troubled Imperial.\nWhat followed was a hectic, disrupted\nand chaotic game, in which individual\nexperience and skill quickly became\nthe decisive factor. he fact that\nImperial got away with a 48:24 victory\nis testament to the poor defending and\nserved as the much need wake-up call\nbefore the University Championship\nQualiiers in February.\nDue to a late cancellation and some\nad-hoc reshuling of the ixture list,\nImperial got the chance to face the\nsame opponents only one week later\nand show that they had learned and\nhad grown from the experience.\nhe Eagles, despite a shaky start,\nwere in control of the game from\nthe irst minute and used their usual\ncounter-attacking style to undo their\nopponents.\nOnce a big margin had been\nestablished, the game calmed down a\nbit and Imperial were inally able to\npractice attack from more structured\nattacks and set pieces. After 60\nminutes, the Eagles claimed a 14:51\nvictory \u2013 their highest win in club\nhistory.

In\nthe latest its grant letter to the Higher\nEducation Funding Council for England\n(HEFCE) the Department for Business,\nInnovation & Skills announced that its\ninal recurrent grant to the sector for\nthe 2014-2015 academic year will be\n\u00a33.6 billion. his is some \u00a3125 million\nless than the estimate 2014-2015\nfunding that was announced in last\nyear\u2019s grant letter.\nIn a letter to HEFCE, Business\nSecretary Vince Cable and Universities\nMinister David Willetts wrote that\n\u201cin the context of stretched public\ninances, it has been necessary to\nmake reductions to the indicative\nrecurrent teaching budget for 14-15\u201d\nand conirmed that \u201cfurther recurrent\nsavings will be required in 15-16\u201d\n.\nMinisters have not dictated in which\nspeciic areas these cuts should be\nmade, indicating that it should be up\nto HEFCE \u201cto take decisions on how\nyou allocate [their] budgets\u201d\n. hey have,\nhowever, indicated that savings should\nbe made \u201cin ways that protect as far as\npossible high cost subjects (including\nSTEM), widening participation and\nsmall and specialist institutions\u201d\n. Cable\nand Willets have also indicated that\ncuts should be made to the salaries of\nsenior University management igures,\nsaying that they \u201cwant to see leaders\nin the sector exercise much greater\nrestraint as part of continuing to hold\ndown increases\u201d\n.\nWhile the government forecasts\nthat their cuts will be more than\ncompensated by increased tuition fee\nincome and while research funding\nhas been protected there are concerns\nthat the changes will afect the poorest\nstudents the worst. In addition to the\ncuts in the Higher Education grant\nthe Government will be scrapping\nthe Access to Learning Fund and\nhalving the budget for the National\nScholarshipProgrammeto\u00a350million.\nhe Government has indicated that\n\u201cthe new funding system places\ngreater responsibility on institutions\nto fund access and retention activities,\nincluding supporting students in cases\nof hardship.\u201d\nResponding to the changes, Shadow\nUniversities Minister Liam Byrne said:\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement lays bare the\nblack hole ministers have created in\nstudent funding. \u2026 he fact that cuts\nare being targeted at support for the\npoorest students at university and the\nskills budget tells you everything you\nneed to know about this government\u2019s\nvalues and their ambitions for Britain\u2019s\nfuture.\n\u201cI\u2019mgladthatmonthsofcampaigning\nandpressurebyLabourandothershave\nprevented the government axing the\nstudent opportunity fund \u2013 but cuts\nto the lifeline that keeps the poorest\nstudents at work and a huge 20% cut\nto the skills budget risk throwing social\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editor\nCable and Willetts announce\nfurther cuts to English\nHigher Education Funding\nmobility in our country into reverse at\nthe very time we need to earn our way\nout of the cost of living crisis.\u201d\nOther responses also voiced similar\nconcerns. Professor Michael Gunn,\nChair of the think tank million+\nexpressed relief that the cuts were\nnot as bad as had been expected. In\na statement he said, \u201chis is a victory\nfor common sense although it is still\ndisappointing that the overall grant is\nbeing cut. Higher education should be\nseen as an investment in the future and\nnot a cost to be constantly trimmed.\nhe balance of responsibility for the\nfundingofhighereducationhasalready\nshifted substantially to graduates and\nthere are very good arguments for\nBritain to emulate our competitors and\ninvest more in both higher education\nteaching and research.\u201d\nProfessor Sir Christopher Snowden,\nPresident of Universities UK \u2013 a\nbody representing the leaders of 133\nUK Higher Education institutions \u2013\nindicated that he believed that the\nGovernment was undervaluing British\nuniversities saying, \u201cUniversities are\ngood for the economy, society and\nindividuals. hey drive economic\ngrowth and innovation, support social\nmobility and are inding solutions\nto the major challenges facing our\nsociety. Other major economies are\ninvesting in their universities, and the\nUK should be investing to support\nresearch and teaching if we want to\nincrease growth and stay globally\ncompetitive.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe are pleased that,\nas far as possible, high cost subjects\n(including STEM), widening\nparticipation and small and specialist\ninstitutions are to be protected but\nwe fail to see how the projected cuts\nfor 2014-15, and the more substantial\nprojected cuts for 2015-16, can be\ndelivered without reducing allocations\nintheseareas.Universitieshavealready\nshouldered substantial reductions\nin public funding for both teaching\nand research in recent years and have\nmade \u00a31.38 billion in eiciency savings\nalready. \u2026 It is right that Government\nhas maintained the science and\nresearch ring fence. However, we need\na long-term plan to increase research\nfunding above inlation if we are to\nremain competitive.

Uttered\nby Natasha Lyonne, she outlined that\nthe alternative to telling a girl you\nlove her is simply to deliver a mind\nblowing orgasm.\nhe pressure exerted by the extreme\ncommercialisation of Valentine\u2019s Day\ntoday may lead you into thinking\nthis is a decision you must make too,\nperhaps some time this evening whilst\nin the dark depths of Metric. Did\nShakespeare not put it as eloquently\nsimple as \u201cTo cum or not to cum?\u201d\nHowever, a lot of questions still\nsurround the female orgasm. Does\nit even exist? Is it correct to say\nthe clitoris is truly God\u2019s bribe for\nchildbirth? Isn\u2019t the G-Spot some\nsort of nightclub? he adjective most\nassociated with the female orgasm\nis \u201celusive,\u201d conining it to a state of\nuncertainty akin to a bus turning\nup on time, or that apparent last\ncomputer on the fourth loor of the\nlibrary.\nHowever, the female orgasm\nis a very real, and very emotive\nphenomenon. It is recognisable by\nmuscular contractions throughout\nthe pelvis, a giant wave of hormonal\nrelease throughout the body, a change\nin brain function, and the potential for\nbreakfast to be brought to you in bed\nthe next morning, if all goes to plan.\nBut just how does a female orgasm?\nOrgasm in females is generally\nachieved by clitoral stimulation, or\nsometimes (but rarely) via direct\nvaginal stimulation. he entirety of\nthe clitoris is actually shaped like a\nsort of wishbone, which mostly hangs\ninternally like an odd muscular curtain\naround each side of the vaginal walls.\nhe external protrusion, known as the\nglans but usually just referred to as\nthe clitoris itself, contains over 8,000\nnerve endings, and is the homologous\nequivalent to the head of the penis.\nUpon arousal, the glans doubles in\ndiameter as it ills with blood, and, as\nstimulation continues, other tissues\nthroughout the entirety of the genitalia\nill with blood too, in a process called\nvasocongestion. Muscles contract and\ncompress a vein within the clitoris, so\nblood can no longer drain out of the\ntissues at all, but simply continues to\nbuild up. hink of this as a far more\nsuperior female boner that won\u2019t\nrequire hiding under a baggy hoodie\nshould it rear its head, as all this is\ngoing on internally and out of sight.\nIncreased vasocongestion inally\nsets of a muscular relex \u2013 the blood\nthat was trapped in the surrounding\ntissues of the clitoris is inally expelled\nwith some force by other muscles\nincluding those surrounding the\nvagina and uterus, leading to the\ncharacteristic, climatic contractions\nof the female orgasm.\nUnfortunately, scientists are still\nunsure what physiological link there\nis to the female orgasm and her\nproclaiming religious outbursts,\ngrabbing bed sheets or even pulling\nhairfromherpartnershead,asresearch\ninto the female orgasm is still very\nmuch in its infancy. One surprising\ndysfunction among scientists is the\nunderstanding of the \u201cG-Spot,\u201d for\nexample. he Grafenberg spot- named\nafter a German gynaecologist in the\n1950s is a considered to be a small\narea of the vagina that some say feels\nlike a walnut, whilst others remark\nthat it feels like the slightly bumpy\nhead of a bald man.\nhe existence of the G-Spot is\nactually yet to be scientiically proven,\nbut research has discovered some\npotential physiological evidence\nof it using ultrasound; those that\nexperience vaginal orgasms (without\nclitoral stimulation) have been found\nto have a thicker anterior vaginal\nwall, possibly due to the presence of\nthe infamous G-Spot. It is thought\nto contain a large number of nerve\nendings too, and vaginal stimulation\nof this area is reported to result in\nmore intense orgasms than clitoral\nstimulus alone.\nHowever, with one study reporting\nthat as many as 80% of women\nare unable to climax with vaginal\nstimulation, and yet another showing\nthat even some identical twins\nexperience diferences when it comes\nto such stimulation, the G-Spot is\nunreliable at best at packing that\npunch. When push comes to shove,\nor rather lick comes to lick, clitoral\nstimulation may prove better than\nprobing for a spot that may not even\nexist.\nBut why do females even orgasm\nat all? A debate currently rages\nbetween evolutionary biologists as\nto whether or not the female orgasm\nis an advantageous adaptation\nfor reproduction. Some argue\nthat orgasms facilitate emotional\nconnections between sexual contact\nand monogamy in humans based on\nthe same hormones being released\nduring climax and through long term\nrelationships. However, with some\nof the most promiscuous of primate\nspecies also able to orgasm too, this\nmay not be the case.\nOthers argue that muscular\ncontractions of the cervix cause it to\n\u201cdip\u201d into the vagina, encouraging\nsperm into the uterus in a manner not\nunlike clubbers being shepherded into\nTigerTiger on a Friday night. However,\nwith the possibility of pregnancy\noccurring without orgasm, and\norgasm also practically a separate ball\ngame to penetrative sex, the cervical\ndip theory seems unlikely too.\nIt has therefore been suggested that,\nrather anti-climatically (ironically),\nfemale orgasms are simply an\nevolutionary accident \u2013 they serve\nno real purpose, but do have that\norgasmic perk. With the evident\nhomologies between the clitoris\nand the head of the penis, and both\ndeveloping in the same way before\nbirth, it may be that the female orgasm\nis purely a serendipitous, if not mind-blowing evolutionary hangover of\nincomplete sexual dimorphism.\nFortunately, multiple orgasms are\nmuch more interesting than male\nnipples, which seem to be equally\ntheoretically pointless, if not literally\nso.\nAlthough this may not answer\nthat ultimate dilemma suggested by\nAmerican Pie, getting to grips with the\ntheory behind the female orgasm may\nprepare you for the practicalities of it,\na little like learning to drive a car, or\ncompleting that lab practical you have\nnext Monday.\nHopefully with some of this science\nat your ingertips, the Big O may not\nseem as overwhelming, and Friday\nevening may go down with a tad\nmore enthusiasm than was previously\nexpected.\nFelix Science wishes you a Happy\nValentines Day.\nwIkIMEDIa FouNDaTIoN\nIf this is what comes to mind when someone says \u201cg- Spot\u201d, then read on my friend\nMagES2.FaNPoP.CoM\nSally looking unimpressed by the lack of knowledge you seem to have about the female orgasm\n\n"

    "content": "36 FRIDAY 14 FEB\nTECHNOLOGY\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Yong Wen\nChua, Osama Awara\ntechnology.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\nFind the egg-laying chicken\nME: Introduce yourself:\nMR: My name is Michael Rolph, I\nam the co-founder of Yoyo which\nhas launched very recently here at\nImperial.\nME: What is the history of Yoyo,\nhow did you guys start out?\nMR: I\u2019ve got a personal background\nwhich is very much from the payment\nspace. Ex-Barclaycard Business, First\nData, Paypal and I\u2019ve spent the last\nthree or so years prior to Yoyo both as\nan investor and advisor in the inancial\ntechnology space, speciically helping\nlarge corporations think about how\nthey innovate in payments. I\u2019ve been\nquite privileged to see a lot of what\ngoes on out there. My two co-founders\nare equally serial entrepreneurs:\nAlain Falys was the founder of OB10\nand Dave Nicholson founded Zopa,\nand both of them were talking about\nmobile payments. I\u2019ve been from the\nspace and every day I heard for the\nlast 15 years or so about how mobile\nis going to be the future of payments.\nhe reality is that this time last year,\nwhen the three of us got together,\nthe conclusion was that there was\nnothing out there. here is a lot of\ntalk about people like Google, Paypal\nand whoever else, but you realise that\nthere is nothing there. here\u2019s lots of\nstartups that have tried to do mobile\npayments but nothing has stuck.\nSo the conclusion we got to was\nthe that the only thing that looked\ninteresting was Starbucks app. 13% of\nall their sales in the US and UK come\nfrom mobile devices. It was the one\nshining light, so we looked at their\napp in quite a bit of detail, as much\nas we could and we came to a few\nconclusions. Firstly, it was not built\nfor purpose, it was just an extension\nof their pre-paid program. he other\npart of it was, actually, it got pretty\nbad pretty quickly. You get the instant\nstamp, but if you get enough stamps\nto get a reward, they send you the\nreward as a paper voucher to your\nhome address. hat is just insane.\nhen when it comes to ofers, there\nis no context, there is no relevance to\nthe ofer they are sending you based\non what you like and what you buy. So\nwe quickly said, it\u2019s really interesting,\nit works, it\u2019s adding some value but\nthere is a lot that could be better. Our\nstarting point then became: Starbucks\nbut better. So that\u2019s how we came\nabout.\nME: I know you have a link with\nImperial Innovations, how did that\nstart/work out?\nMR: Alain [Falys] was actually\na Venture Partner at Imperial\nInnovations and when we all three\ncame together it felt quite natural that\nwe should meet there. Innovations\nhave been very early supporters of us\nas a team. We were unique and quite\ndiferent from a lot of people who had\ntried this before and failed, because\nwe were from the space and we are\nnot a traditional set of entrepreneurs,\nas we are not irst time entrepreneurs.\nWe also had good connections in the\nretail space and we had a good view\nof it. So they supported us early on to\nmake it [Yoyo] our full time job, as it\nwere. So since September last year, all\nthree of us have been really focused on\nYoyo.\nME: So, I am also quite aware that\nyou are active in other universities,\nwhy target universities and\nstudents?\nMR: Launching something that\nchanges, or gives someone the ability\nto change their behaviour, as mobile\ndoes, is not easy because you\u2019ve got\na two-headed beast to tackle. You\u2019ve\ngot to get the consumers, the users, as\nwell as the retailer. he whole industry\ntalks about this chicken and egg\nsituation, but in my mind if you\u2019ve ind\nthe thing that looks like the chicken\nthat laid the irst egg that then became\nthe chicken, then its a pretty obvious\npoint that you can do something with\nit. So we started of at universities,\njust as it worked for Facebook. What\nwe are building here is a consumer\nnetwork, and from that perspective,\nyou need to get your critical mass\npretty quickly, get some momentum.\nEqually you need to solve a problem,\nand when you think about what\nwe\u2019ve really done, even if we forget\nwhat Yoyo is going to do in the retail\nspace, there are some real annoyances\naround paying and loyalty aspects in\nany closed campus environment that\nwe addressed. Most would say, either\nyou have to pay by cash or you\u2019ve\ngot to use some kind of closed-loop\nprepaid card, which you have to top\nup, and that can become quite a pain.\nSo although payment isn\u2019t\nbroken, there are a number of small\nannoyances like queueing for an ATM,\nhaving to deal with change, having to\nwait in a queue whilst someone mucks\naround with getting the right change\nor dropping their money, whatever it\nmay be, that if you eliminate would\nmake everything much easier and\nwe\u2019ve done that in a very simple way.\nME: Now, more specific to Imperial,\nat the moment you are linked to\nTaste Imperial, are you planning to\nbranch out to the Union?\nMR: We are currently integrating\ninto the Union, and at some point in\nFebruary we expect to be there. We\nare actually testing today. We expect\ntobe up and running within fourteen\ndays or so.\nME: At the moment it is only\nwith Taste Imperial (food related\nestablishments) are you planning\nanything with the gifts shop at\nImperial for example?\nMR: he only thing that currently isn\u2019t\nable to accept Yoyo, or going to accept\nYoyo within February are the shops,\nbut we will bring the shops on board\nas well.\nME: In terms of features, is there\nanything that you are planning to\nrelease?\nMR: he next release will include\nthings like PIN-entry for access to the\napp, it will include automated top-up,\nand a whole bunch of things around\nthe rewards, sort of Yoyo speciic\nrewards but actually what we\u2019ve got\nhere is the irst release, so we are\nactually building version 2, that will\nbring in things like being able to share\nrewards with friends for example.\nME: Currently you are only on\nAndroid and iOS, are you planning\nanything Windows?\nMR: We will do a Windows\napplication, probably towards the\nend of this year. We built something\nfor Apple and Android, not because\nit\u2019s not necessarily easier, but because\nthat\u2019s 95% of the market. However\nuniversities are actually one of the\nonly areas where Windows has a\nproportionately higher share, so it is\ndeinitely on our list of things to do.\nME: Also you work with QR codes\nright now, what about NFC?\nMR: he reason we work with QR\ncodes, is because it is the easiest thing\nfor a retailer. It works with all their\nexisting hardware, the only thing we\nhave to help them with is the scanners,\nbut that\u2019s relatively easy. As for NFC,\nwe are not adverse to it, we are actually\ntechnology agnostic at the front end,\nso if NFC did become the norm, then\nabsolutely we would make it part of\nthe every-day experience of Yoyo.\nME: Do you see contactless cards as\na competitor to Yoyo?\nMR: No. A lot of people have issues\nMax Eggl talks to one of the Yoyo founders Michael Rolph,\non the merits of mobile and future plans of Yoyo at Imperial\nThe whole industry\ntalks about this\nchicken and egg\nsituation, but in my\nmind if you\u2019ve find\nthe thing that looks\nlike the chicken that\nlaid the first egg\nthat then became\nthe chicken, then\nits a pretty obvious\npoint that you can do\nsomething with it.\n\u201c\n\u201d\nleft to Right: Maximilian Eggl, Michael Rolph MAxIMILIAN EGGL\n\n"

    "content": "35\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 14 FEB\nTELEVISION\nThree musketeers, one review\nT\nhere are a few ways to\ninstantly sell me on a new TV\nshow, regardless of reviews\nor recommendations. he\nnew BBC show, Musketeers,\nhit virtually all of the boxes: an\nadaptation of an all-time favourite\nbook, a cast featuring Peter Capaldi\nand the hot artist from Heroes, and\nplenty of sword ights. I\u2019d have eagerly\nwatched it regardless of any bad\nreviews, which is probably for the\nbest, as it had something of a mixed\nreception from critics.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why: Musketeers\nis trashy in the best sense of the word,\nmore interesting in having fun than\nhistorical accuracy, with a mostly\nyoung, attractive cast who spend a\nlot of time wearing too little clothing.\nThen again, anyone who\u2019s read Dumas\u2019\nnovel knows it was never intended\nto be high-brow literature; the book\nitself is definitely of the most purely\nentertaining classic French novels, so\nI don\u2019t have any objection to the show\nprioritising fun over accuracy.\nOur protagonist is d\u2019Artagnan, a\nyoung country boy desperate to join\nthe King\u2019s Musketeers, whose journey\nto Paris starts off with a bang after the\ninn where he and his father are staying\nis attacked. The opening scenes\nalready make a rapid departure from\nthe events of the book in the killing\noff of d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s father (it\u2019s not a\nspoiler if it happens in the first five\nminutes), which I felt was a somewhat\nunnecessary change for the sake of\nadding drama.\nThe opening episode also introduces\nus to the Musketeers themselves, the\nKing, and the Cardinal. The former\nare, respectively, Athos, Porthos, and\nAramis, who are by turns shown to be\nviolent, womanising, and chivalrous.\nThe Musketeers, with their rallying\ncry of \u2018all for one and one for all\u2019 (the\noriginal \u2018bros before hos\u2019) are charged\nwith keeping the peace on behalf of\nthe King, Louis XIII. Tensions are\nhigh, however, with the common\n17th century power struggle between\nchurch and state existing between the\nKing and Cardinal Richelieu, whose\nown guards are constantly duelling\nwith the Musketeers. Tales of court\nscheming and unwise bedfellows are\nas old as most monarchies, yet always\nseem to provide good fodder for\nhistorical dramas.\nThis is the situation that d\u2019Artagnan\nfinds himself caught up in, when\nupon arriving in Paris he manages to\nfind himself right in the middle of a\nbrawl and challenging Athos to a duel\nto the death after a case of mistaken\nidentity. The first episode is certainly\naction-packed, with more than three\nswordfights and a few raunchy scenes.\nThe cast is one of the strongest aspects of the show. One setback was a\nminor controversy over whether the\ncasting of Porthos as mixed-race is\nan attempt to be \u2018politically correct\u2019\n(which, really, can we just stop having\nthis debate - not only have non-white\npeople been around in Europe since\nat least Roman times, ethnicity is the\nleast of most historical drama\u2019s issues\nwith accuracy. In addition, Alexandre\nDumas himself was black, so the casting makes sense if only as a nod to its\nauthor). In reality, all of the Musketeers are well-cast: Athos, played by\nthe strong, stoic leader of the group,\nand Santiago Cabrera is perfect as\n\u2018pretty boy\u2019 Aramis, whose talents in\nduelling are matched only by his talents of enticing women into bed. Luke\nPasqualino, of Skins fame, is also good\nat portraying d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s sensitivity\nand the recklessness that comes with\nhis immaturity. Finally, Peter Capaldi\nis unsurprisingly perfect as the Cardinal, as his face does lend itself so well\nto the role of scheming villain.\nThe main issues with the\nprogramme are those which are\nbasically inherent to the book: pretty\nmuch every female character is either\na seductive temptress (the character of\nMilady is one of the most stereotypical\nfemme fatales around) or a feisty love\ninterest, and it takes a while to see the\nMusketeers as sympathetic characters\nrather than Renaissance-era \u2018lads\u2019\nwho spend all their time brawling\nand chatting up women. It\u2019s another\nreason why it\u2019s worth sticking with the\nshow for a few episodes to see if it\u2019s a\ngrower, even if you\u2019re not keen on the\nfirst episode.\nThe most recent adaptation of The\nThree Musketeers was a film only three\nyears ago starring Orlando Bloom and\nMilla Jovovich. It met to unanimously\nawful reviews, but in my opinion it\u2019s a\nbook that naturally lends itself better\nin TV format, given that it was first\npublished as a series in a newspaper\nand weaves many plot lines taking\nplace over a fairly long period of time.\nIt\u2019s also just a really good book, and\nmissing huge chunks of it out in order\nto condense it into a two hour film\nseems a shame.\nIt may not be a realistic portrayal\nof 17th century France, but what\nit lacks in realism it makes up for\nin its commitment to ensuring the\nviewer has a good time. Having been\ncommissioned by the BBC for a second\nseries, it\u2019s clear that the majority of its\naudience are so far on board. With\nten episodes in total in the first series,\nthings are looking promising for the\nMusketeers.\nEmily Fulham takes a swash-buckling journey into Renaissance France\nBBC\nBBC\n\n"

    "content": "37\nFRIDAY 17 JAN\nTECHNOLOGY\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Yong Wen\nChua, Osama Awara\ntechnology.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\nwith contactless cards in two ways.\nOne, some places don\u2019t accept them\nand equally not every bank doesn\u2019t\nissuecontactlesscards.Soaubiquitous\nexperience isn\u2019t there. However, if\nsomeone is using them and they\nwork, it works really well but what\na contactless card doesn\u2019t do what\nYoyo does, is it doesn\u2019t enable you to\nautomate the whole stamping of the\nloyalty card, it doesn\u2019t enable you to\nreceive ofers. What we are building\nis fundamentally very diferent.\nWhat we have got is, efectively, a\nmarketing tool for retailers to have a\nbetter relationship with consumers,\nby sending them more ofers or giving\nthem more rewards.\nME: One aspect that seemed to put\na lot of people off Yoyo was security\nissues, and one of the things that did\nworry them was the whole pin thing,\nif you lose your phone for example.\nMR: Let\u2019s put this into some context.\nOn the table in front of me, I have\nmy wallet and my phone. Which\none is easier for you to get access to\nmoney from? he wallet, right? So the\nminute you have access to my wallet,\nyou have access to any cash I have in\nmy wallet, access to my contactless\ncard, my credit cards and you had to\ndo nothing to get there. Now if I say\nyou have my phone, away you go. If it\u2019s\nlocked, there\u2019s not much you can do.\nSo there is a reliance that most people\ndo have a irst line of authentication to\nget into the device, be it ingerprint,\npin or passcode. hen on the app\nitself if someone wants to add a PIN\non top of that, on the next version we\nare releasing, then they can do that. So\nwe have two layers of authentication,\nwhich is more than on a wallet.\nEqually, once you have my card details\nyou can go online and do all sorts of\nthings. One can probably get your\ncard, ind out date of birth and address\npretty easily, believe it or not, and do\nwhatever they want. With Yoyo, the\nminuteyou\u2019velostyourphone,you will\nrealise. You will realise you lost your\nphone before you\u2019ve lost your wallet.\nYour phone is your third arm. So the\nirst you can do is then lock the phone,\nend of story. hen you can Yoyo, and\nask us to block your account. here is\na whole bunch of things that you can\ndo very quickly, that you can\u2019t do with\na wallet. It\u2019s very simple.\nME: Another thing that comes to\nmind, it seemed incredibly easy\nto set up a yoyo account. You only\nneeded a name, account number,\nsort code and address. So what stops\nme, finding out that information\nof someone else, and then putting\ntheir account details onto my Yoyo\naccount?\nMR: We do a lot of background\nchecking, we match your username\nversus bank details. We are also\npartnered with GoCardless, which\nis a very well established direct debit\nmanagement platform. I hope though,\nthat the irst thing that would stop\nyou, is that you aren\u2019t a criminal.\nHowever you can\u2019t rule it out, though I\nstrongly advise anybody studying here\nnot to do it. On the basis that they are\nmessing with their future.\nME: Lastly in terms of secturity:\nWe currently live in the world of\nBig Data. Obviously Yoyo get data\nfrom the users, what is your policy\non that?\nMR: Around data, and anything we do\nwhether it\u2019s on Facebook or Twitter,\neverything is accessible to everybody.\nhey govern this under a term called\nthe privacy policy, which is exactly\nthe opposite. So what we have done, is\nturned that on its head a bit. We have\ncome up with something called the\ntransparency agreement, and as part\nof that transparency agreement, what\nwe state is that we will never share\nyour data with a merchant. What that\nmeans, is your contact information,\neven your name, because there is no\nneed to. What we can let the retailer\nknow is what you are buying, but they\nknow that anyway. What we do is give\nit to them in a way that at least gives\nthem a little insight, to better engage\nyou with ofers that are relevant. So\nwhat we do share is for the beneit of\ndriving better ofers, better rewards\nfor diferent customer segments,\ndiferent users. What we don\u2019t share is\nthe personal identifying information.\nWe don\u2019t share any of the inancial\ninformation around funding methods,\nor anything like that. So we see\nourselves as a kind of ilm in between,\nwhich manages the relationship on\nboth sides, user and retailer, for the\nbeneit of both in a way that doesn\u2019t\nconlict anyone in anything they don\u2019t\nwant to be conlicted in.\nME: So given now that you have all\nthe aforementioned data, will you\nbe able to give personalised offers?\nMR: Absolutely. In fact my next\nmeeting is with Catering Services, to\ntalk about Yoyo speciic only ofers.\nGoing forward, this is totally what\nthis is about. Actually you can start to\ncategorize people into segments pretty\nquickly, based on an understanding of\nwhat they buy.\nIf you are buying cofee two times\na day, you may sit to the right hand\nside of a spectrum of cofee drinkers.\nhen what would the segment cofee\ndrinkers like to eat with their cofees.\nPerhaps a cofee and pastry type of\nofer would work for them and if\nthey are buying cofee at 8:30 in the\nmorning, then we should send their\nofers 8 o\u2019clock, so they can think\nabout it and then take advantage of it.\nSo, where we are going with Yoyo, is\nactually about creating, from the user\u2019s\nperspective, a personalised commerce\nenvironment. You are deined by your\nbehaviour, your behaviour is where\nyou choose to spend money. We are\nnot suggesting where you do it, we are\nofering you the ability to manage the\nworld in the way you want it, so you\ncan see the ofers and rewards that are\nmost meaningful to you.\nWhat we all recognize, we, the\nfounders of Yoyo, are consumers, too.\nA lot of the things that lead to Yoyo,\nare because I found being bombarded\nby e-mails and texts really annoying. I\ndon\u2019t care that I am near a Starbucks,\nI just don\u2019t care. So every time it pings\nup in Passbook, I just turn it all of.\nBut what I do care about for example\na Fernandez and Wells - which is my\nfavourite cofee joint - I would like to\nknow if I am near one. So to be able\nto personalise that experience in a\nway where I don\u2019t have to download\nmultiple retailer apps would be great!\nME: So are you planning to expand\nout of universities?\nMR: What we are building is deinitely\nfor the high street as well as for the\ncampus, the reason being is that we\nwant to start bringing is the ability to\ngive more to you, the consumers, of\nthings that they like. As a consumer,\nwhat do we really want out of any\ntransaction? We want to pay less,\nand we want to get more, and that is\ntotally what Yoyo is relying on doing.\nYes, a retailer wants to sell more, but\nobviously it also wants to provide\na great customer experience and\nwherever possible they want to save\nmoney. Saving money is equivalent\nto not wasting money. By enabling\nretailer to ofer rewards that are more\nappropriate for diferent segments,\nticking the boxes that they want to\ntick. Most importantly for a users\nperspective, you are starting to get\nthings that are relevant to you, and not\njust homogenised for anybody.\nME: So on a completely different\nnote, why Yoyo? What\u2019s with the\nname?\nMR: Choosing a name is very diicult\nin today\u2019s world of startup boom.\nhe irst thing about Yoyo is that\neveryone knows what a yoyo is. It\u2019s\nvery international in terms of its\npollination of language. Yoyo is a\nyoyo everywhere you go and most\npeople, unless you had one ping you\nin the eye, have a positive experience.\nIt\u2019s very playful and very engaging.\nEqually if you think of the process of\nspinning a yoyo out, and then coming\nback to you, it\u2019s the same thing when\nyou think about paying for something\nand what you get back is rewards and\nofers. So, it\u2019s a very engaging process,\nand it\u2019s memorable, right?\nME: Any last thoughts, any thing\nleft to say? Maybe why imperial\nstudents should use yoyo?\nMR: he reason why we chose\nImperial is because there is a high\nconcentration of smart people in one\nplace and you know, if we are going\nto build something relevant for the\nworld, what better place than to launch\nit at Imperial. he feedback we get is\ninvaluable to help us create a better\nconsumer experience, which we all\nlove and all consumers would beneit\nfrom that. It\u2019s something that\u2019s very\nquick and simple. Our belief is that if\nwe get it right here, and get it right at\nthe other universities we are going to\nroll Yoyo out at, that the concept that\nwe can go to the world with is that\nsmart people buy with Yoyo. I would\nencourage everyone to download it,\nuse it and start taking advantage of the\nYoyo speciic rewards and ofers.\nME: Sorry to keep you, but one last\nquestion; You had this 10% offer for\ntopping up in January. Sadly that\u2019s\nover now, but do you have any other\npromotions to encourage more\npeople to start using Yoyo?\nMR: : In February, we are running\nprize draws, whenever you pay with\nYoyo on campus you have a chance\nof winning either \u00a310 or \u00a350 of Yoyo\nbalance (there are multiple winners).\nWe will be doing the irst draw at the\nend of this week, and that is running\nthroughout the whole of February. You\ncan get the updates on the winners on\nTwitter at @justyoyo, and On our page\non Facebook.We are deinitely making\nsure that there is a chance for people to\nwin and enjoy their Yoyo experience.\n#yoyonotyolo\n\n"

    "content": "40 FRIDAY 14 FEB\nTRAVEL\nEditor: Chris\nRichardson\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nVeliko Tarnovo\nBy Akanksha Garg\nW\ne arrived at Soia Airport,\nshattered from our\nmidnight travels from\nHeathrow to Bulgaria. On landing,\nwe were shocked at the rain and cold\nweather, having had only packed\nshorts anticipating the very welcome\n30-degree heat. he coach ride from\nSoia to Veliko Tarnovo was about\nive hours long, and we were worried\nabout commuting, reading and\nspeaking the Bulgarian language. We\nmanaged to make our way from Soia\nto Veliko Tarnovo, and for the irst\ntime experienced the beauty of the\nundiscovered Bulgarian landscapes.\nWhen we reached Veliko Tarnovo,\nwe were surprised by how big it was,\nmainly because everyone told us it was\na very small town. We were greeted\nby Katia, the ICAB representative,\nat the station. She had arranged our\naccommodation and gave us the\nnecessary information and helped\nto make us feel welcome and settled.\nOur accommodation was accessible\nby climbing what felt like a million\nlights of stairs, which from then on\nmade up our daily exercise. We moved\ninto a tiny little house on a top of a\nhill, which gave a lovely view of the\nnew city from our garden. On our irst\nnight in Veliko Tarnovo, we decided\nto go explore the city and discovered\nfood was very cheap and only cost\nabout \u00a36 for a pretty big meal.\nAfter a brief training session\nwith Katia and meeting our lovely\ntranslator, we went to the orphanage\nin Balvan, a small town that was about\ntwenty minutes from Veliko Tarnovo\nby bus. It was completely secluded,\nwith two shops and a single school.\nWe were apprehensive about how we\nwould communicate and entertain\nthirty children, all from a diferent\nculture, and with most being teenaged\nboys with whom we didn\u2019t share much\nin common.\nhey were, however, very excited\nto meet us, and we started the day\nby playing a few group games to get\nto know everyone. As days passed in\nthe orphanage, we got to know each\nchild personally, some opening up\nfaster than others. We discovered\nthat their favourite pastime was just\nrunning around and playing outdoors.\nhe older children were content\nby themselves but joined in group\nactivities. hey were huge fans of\nfreerunning and parkour, and really\nenjoyed showing us their dangerous-looking tricks. hey also loved taking\nphotos of themselves!\nSome of the activities we organized\nincluded playing with balls, gold\nclubs, skipping ropes, planting pots,\nface painting, and group games. We\ndid notice that the children didn\u2019t\nwant to preserve the toys: they played\nwith them for about ten minutes\nbefore they were broken. On our last\nday in Veliko Tarnovo, we organised\na party which was joint with a three-year-old boy\u2019s birthday party. his was\ntruly a wonderful way to say goodbye,\nas the whole orphanage got together\nand played some games, danced and\nenjoyed party food.\nDuring our time of, we went to\nthe nearby church and walked past\nTsarevets Castle. he old town itself\nwas a sight to visit with paved streets\nadorned with tourist shops selling\nproud Bulgarian souvenirs. here\nwere plenty of restaurants and bars\nin the old city that ofered breathtaking views of the mountain ranges\nand valleys, especially around sunset.\nOn the Saturday, we accompanied\nVeliko Tarnovo orphanage on a ive\nkilometre trek to the mountain area\nwhere there was a competition for\nchildren. Children took part in a\nvariety of sporting activities and we\ncheered them on and enjoyed the\nscenery.\nOur week at Veliko Tarnovo and\nBalvan orphanage was really diferent\nto anything anticipated. It was a shock\nat irst having thirteen year old boys\nrunning around and tickling you, but\nafter a while we became one of them\nand really enjoyed out time playing\nand bonding with the children.\nVarna\nBy Anu Bhide\nH\naving come straight from\nhistoric Veliko Tarnovo, where\nwe always had a translator\nand guide, we were a little more wary\nwhen we arrived in Varna. We had\nbeen in contact with a representative\nfrom the orphanage where we would\nbe working, but she had not arranged\nany accommodation and simply\nexpected us to turn up to work the\nnext morning.\nVarna was a reasonably large coastal\ntown, a popular seaside destination\namong the Balkan countries. We\nstayed at a very sociable youth hostel\nwe had reserved in advance, where\nstaf were helpful in guiding and\nadvising us as well as entertaining\ntheir guests in the evenings.\nhe orphanage was a mixture of\nchildren who lived there, and Romany\nchildren who came in either every\nmorning or every afternoon for a\nsession. hey were boys and girls aged\nive to ifteen, although most were\nquite young. At Gavroche, they played\ngames outdoors in the play area as\nwell as indoors, and we found that the\nchildren especially enjoyed colouring\nand painting. We had taken a range of\ntoys with us that all proved popular:\nthe biggest hits were face paints.\nOn some evenings the children\nreceived lessons in swimming and\nmartial arts, and we were welcome\nto stay and watch. All of the children,\nlacking in attention and activities,\nwere quick to bond with us and ight\neach other for personal attention.\nhey were friendly and eager to\nparticipate in any activity we decided\nto organise, although this was easier\nsaid than done as nobody spoke any\nEnglish! Our representative was not\npresent on all days at all times, and\nwe were mostly just left to ourselves,\nable to come and go as we pleased.\nOur usual weekday schedule was from\nabout 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and we were\nnot expected to come on weekends.\nhe evenings and weekends were\neasily illed as Varna is a typical beach\ntourist destination. he pedestrianised\nroad leading up to the beach is illed\nwith ice cream, slushie and sweet\ncorn (a really popular roadside snack\nin Bulgaria, it seems) carts, and the\nbeach itself is beautifully sandy and\nfull of beach bars and restaurants.\nhere is a dolphinarium that is\nworth a visit if you haven\u2019t been to\none before and have the time, and\nthe archaeological museum if you\nhave the patience. here is also a free\nwalking tour of Varna that runs every\nday with locals who volunteer, which\nis a great way to start your week \u2013 a\ndeinite recommendation. Free time\ncan also be spent by taking a walk\nalong the sea garden: this is just\nadjacent to the beach, and great when\nyou need some shade in the very hot\nclimes of Bulgarian summers.\nhe restaurants by the seaside were\nexpensive by Bulgarian standards (but\nstill pretty good compared to the UK),\nbut we found some places popular\nwith the locals where the food was\nbetter and the prices were cheaper.\nhe most famous of these is probably\nAlba, which is easily recognisable by\nits bright green exterior. One night\nwe went to a local beach club with\nthe staf from our hostel and the other\nguests, which it made for a pretty good\nnight out. Just be wary of the mastika!\nICAB\nImperial College Aid to the Balkans\n(ICAB) is currently accepting\napplications for volunteers.
