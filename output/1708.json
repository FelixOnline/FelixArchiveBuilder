    "content": "of momentum as we are\ncarried from plot twist to\nplot twist. Minimalistic\nand uncluttered staging\nhelps achieve this with\nfluidity, while Helena\nBonner\u2019s striking costume\ndesigns for the witches\nensure we have our fill of\nvisually arresting scenes.\nDowd is undoubtedly\nthe star of the show, with\nher brilliant, layered portrayal of Macbeth. Hungry\nambition, deep-seated\nself-doubt and crushing\nguilt are written transparently in turn on her\nexpressive features,\nand Macbeth\u2019s famous\nsoliloquy \u201cTomorrow,\nand tomorrow, and\ntomorrow\u2026\u201d is delivered\nwith such raw vulnerability that we really feel the\nNYT Rep\u2019s Macbeth\nH\naving had\na chat with\nboth Macbeth\n(Olivia Dowd)\nand Lady Macbeth (Isabel\nAdomakoh Young) a\nfortnight prior, I was\nparticularly excited to\nsee them on stage for the\nNational Youth Theatre\u2019s\nproduction of Macbeth.\nMoira Buffini\u2019s abridged\nversion results in a snappy,\nintense play which runs\nstraight through for just\nunder 100 minutes with\nno interval between.\nThe production opens\nwith a bang, curtains\nrising on the three trou-blemaking witches who\ncraftily instigate most of\nthe trouble in Macbeth. In\nkeeping with the \u2018genderfluid\u2019 casting, two of them\nare played by male actors,\nAidan Cheng and Jeffrey\nSangalang, with Simran\nHunjun completing the\ntrio. Gender doesn\u2019t really\nmatter with the witches,\nwho even in Shakespeare\u2019s original were not\nso much \u2018female\u2019 as \u2018unclassifiable\u2019. Nixon has\nreally run with the freaky\ntheme for the witches\nhere; Cheng giggles\nmanically while tottering\naround the stage in white\nfacepaint, fetish heels\nand a fluffy tutu, while\nHunjun, draped head to\ntoe in red, wanders about\nthe stage like a monolithic\nCassandra. Cheng is\nparticularly convincing\nin his \u2018creepy clown\u2019\nportrayal, although I did\nfind it a bit over-the-top.\nBut perhaps that was the\npoint. The three of them\nare a looming presence\nthroughout the play, and\nreappear as Macbeth\u2019s\nhired assassins \u2013 a nice\ntouch that underscores the\ncentral role of the witches\nto the events of the plot.\nThe lack of an interval\nworks well, with no loss\nempty meaninglessness\nlurking behind its words.\nOpposite her, Adomakoh\nYoung sparks with energy\nas Lady Macbeth, urgently\nspurringMacbethtoaction\nin the first acts before\ndescending into a dark,\nguilt-driven madness. It\u2019s\na well-balanced partner-ship, with genuine chemistry between the two of\nthem on stage.\nFor all that the\nNYT\u2019s Macbeth has\nbeen advertised as a\ngenderfluid production,\nthe fact that Macbeth\nand Lady Macbeth are\nin a queer relationship\nis barely noticeable. As\nAdomakoh Young said,\nthere doesn\u2019t really seem\nto be a specific message\nabout gender that Nixon\nand Buffini are trying to\nbring across. Rather, if\nit\u2019s about getting the best\nactors for each role, Dowd\nhas certainly delivered on\nthat promise.\nThe rest of the cast\ndelivers a solid supporting performance, but\nthere remains a touch\nof the amateur about\nit \u2013 overall it definitely\nfeels like a youth theatre\nperformance. Which,\nadmittedly, it is. The\npoint of NYT Rep is to\nbe a training programme\nfor young actors, and it\u2019s\ngood to see casting open\nup so that more actors,\nmale or female, can cut\ntheir teeth on big roles\nlike Macbeth.\nHaving a laugh at Winter Wonderland\nA\ncommon theme\nat Winter\nWonderland is\nwalking around\nin the cold, drinking\nmulled wine in the cold,\nand riding the ridiculous\nrollercoasters, also in the\ncold.

    "content": "ISSUE 1708\nFELIX\n13\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe grief of Brexit is nearly over\nComment writer Akil Eamon Farhat argues that we must approach Brexit with certainty.\nCOMMENT\nAkil Eamon Farhat\nComment Writer\nT\nhere are five\nstages of grief:\ndenial, anger,\nbargaining, depression and acceptance.\nWe as a country have\nfinally gotten near the end\nof our Brexit grief. First\nthere was the denial that\nwe as a country would ever\nvote for such a preposterous idea. Then there was\nanger as it became apparent our country was much\nmore divided than we had\nthought and that Brexit\nwas now a reality. Next\ncame the long bargaining\nwith the EU, to come up\nwith a deal while still\nreassuring ourselves that\neverything would be ok.\nA government report that\ncame out last week hints\nto the next stage: depres-sion, the chancellor Philip\nHammond saying the\ncountry would be worse\n\u201cin pure economic terms\u201d.\nIf this metaphor continues\nto holds true, the next\nstage is acceptance. We\nas a country, both re-mainers and leavers, will\nlearn to accept what has\nhappened and move on.\nWith an important vote\ntaking place on the 11th\nof December, it is finally\ntime to accept May\u2019s\nBrexit as the possibility of\na revote is negligible and\nthe prospect of a no deal\nis disastrous.\nThere are logical\nreasons why a people\u2019s\nvote is not viable, but\nthe common argument\nthat such a vote would\nundermine the will of the\nBritish people is not the\none being made here. A\ndemocratic vote that could\nbe undemocratic is as ox-ymoronic as a strong and\nstable government under\nTheresa May. Unfortunately despite support by\nMPs as well as an alleged\n700,000 protestors in\nLondon, as long as the\nconservative government\nis in power, there is no\nchance of this vote. The\ncross party campaign for\na people\u2019s vote is a true\nthing of beauty. It spreads\nhope and tries to redefine\nhow to spread a political\nmessage after the dirty\ncampaign fought back in\n2016.\nUnfortunately, campaigning for something\nthat will never happen is\na simple waste of great\nminds and resources.\nThe campaign for a\npeople\u2019s vote in some\nways is like the LGBT\nmovement or the Suffragettes: a massive fight\nfor basic rights (freedom\nof movement, etc) which\ndefines what type of\ncountry we are. There is\none important distinction\nwith the aforementioned\nhistoric movements: the\npeople\u2019s vote has a time\nlimit, Brexit. Looking\npractically there is no time\nfor a people\u2019s vote to take\nplace. The preparations,\nlegislation and political\ncoordination take longer\nthan the 4 months left until\nBrexit day. Sure, an extension could be granted\nbut that would be at the\ndiscretion of the European\nCouncil and would just\nadd more uncertainty, a\ncommodity that is not\nlacking. Overall, unless\ncircumstances change\ndrastically, such as a new\nof government, a people\u2019s\nvote is unlikely.\nEven if we accept that\nBrexit will go ahead, and\nthat a people\u2019s vote won\u2019t\nhappen, many still believe\nan alternate version of\nBrexit is possible. In\nfact, never before have\nso many MPs, from every\ncorner of the commons,\nwe would probably get\na few cheap fairy lights\ninstead. Now, 30 months\nlater, reality has struck\nand what we have is a\nreasonable compromise.\nUnfortunately, it will\nmost probably not get the\nsupport of parliament and\nthus the country will be\nthrust into another period\nof uncertainty as May\ngoes back to renegotiate.\nOther that a few small\nconcessions from the EU,\nthe deal will not change\ndrastically and thus will\npotentially never get\nthrough parliament. With\nno clear alternative the\nfuture has never seemed\nso unsure. As many\nfret about the economic\ndamage that Brexit could\ncause, they do not consider\nthe damage caused by\nthis uncertainty. What\nthe country needs more\nTheresa May has definitely looked funnier than this// Flickr\n\u201cThis deal,\neven after\nrenegotiation,\nwill likely\nnever make\nit through\nparliament\u201d\nunited against May\u2019s deal.\nWhether it be a harder or\nsofter Brexit, everyone\nthinks they can do it better\nand yet no one has the\ndetails to back that up.You\ncan\u2019t remove the backstop\nwhen there is a possibility\nof a hard Northern Irish\nborder.. You can\u2019t end free\nmovement of people while\nretaining the economic\nperks. The EU has made\ntheir position very clear\non these issues for almost\n2 years and no backbench\nTory MP will change that.\nWhile we were\npromised the stars and\nthe moons when the\nnegotiations began, it\nquickly became clear that\nthan ever is to be sure of\nwhat is to come, whatever\nit might be. What the\ncountry needs is a strong\nand stable government\nwhich will implement\nBrexit and mitigate the\nconsequences. If the\ngovernment cannot do\nthis and the uncertainty\ncontinues then maybe it is\ntime for a change, or is it\ntoo late?\n\n"

Last week, I\nacknowledged that the\njig is well and truly up.\nAs we approach the end\nof the year, it is time for\nreflection and, as I reflect\non my first term in the\nrole as editor, one thing I\ndefinitely hope to improve\non is my organisational\nskills.

My\nsister was in it; she\u2019ll be\ngoing to university next\nyear, making this her last\nperformance. The show\nwas great fun, not exactly\nShakespeare but the\ncast were having a good\ntime and that spirit was\ninfectious. At the end of\nthe show there was a very\ntearful goodbye from all\nthe members leaving this\nyear, and it showed just\nhow much the club meant\nto them, and how much it\nstill means to me.\nI joined \u201cParsnips\u201d\nyouth drama company\nduring year 7. The move\nfrom primary to secondary school was unkind\n\u2013 I wasn\u2019t ready for the\nchange and friend-making\nprocess to start again, so\nI retreated into my shell.\nMy happiness was on a\ndownswing; that was until\nI joined Parsnips. I knew\nsome of my old friends\nwent, but I had never\nthought drama could be\nfor me. At the time I was\nstocky and certainly not\nconventionally attractive,\nbut more than anything I\nwas quiet and nervous.\nBut I gave it a go, and\nit was the best decision\nI made in my years at\nschool. I didn\u2019t take to it\nimmediately, but seeing\nmy friends again was\nnice and the sessions had\na compelling energy to\nthem. Established and run\nby Claire Parsons (that\u2019s\nwhere the name came\nfrom), her goal was never\nto groom future stars \u2013 all\nshe wanted was to instil\nchildren with the same\nlove of arts she had. And\nit certainly worked.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I\nwas invested in the group.\nEach week consisted\npartly of dramatic exercises and partly of devising\nshort pieces using what\nwe learned. I\u2019ve never\nbeen in a group where\neveryone was so \u201cup for\nit\u201d. As time went by it\nhelped me break that shell\nI had hidden in. My social\ncomfort and confidence\nimproved in line with\nmy time in the group, but\nmore than that I learned\nthe joys of entertaining\nothers.\nThroughout the seven\nyears I had with the\ncompany I knew every\nweek, no matter the cir-cumstances, I would have\ntwo hours of happiness\nand sanctuary.\nSeven years moves fast,\nand after many shows I\nfinally found myself on\nthat stage, saying that\ntearful goodbye, better\nfor the experience and yet\nhorribly sad to see it end.\nParsnips was more than a\nclub, it was a family that\npushed you to be better,\nwith a mother who worked\nunreasonable hours to\nmake sure you had the best\nexperience of your life.\nAnd that stuck with me.\nIt stuck with all Parsnips,\nas the row behind me\nlast weekend was filled\nwith 25-26 year olds.\nThe show was written by\nClaire seven years ago,\nand the row behind was\nfull of members of the\noriginal cast, together\nagain from across the\ncountry to support the\nnext generation.\nWhen done right\namateur dramatics can be\na powerful thing.\nSamuel Welton\nArts Writer\nARTS\nWriter Samuel Welton reflects on the ability of youth theatre to inspire confidence in young people.\n\u201cShe wanted to\ninstil children\nwith the same\nlove of arts\nshe had. And\nit certainly\nworked\u201d\nW\nhen books\nare made\nintomovies,\nfans and\ncritics flock like vultures to tease apart the\ncatastrophe to come.\nWhen the holy works of\nDr Seuss were converted\ninto a musical by Monty\nPython\u2019s Eric Idle, similar\nscenes could be predicted.\nThe story tries to integrate\ncharacters from across the\nSeuss universe like The\nCat in the Hat, Horton\nthe Elephant, Gertrude\nMcFuzz and many more.\nThe story focuses on\nHorton trying to protect the tiny planet of\nWhoville, which lies on\na speck of dust, from the\ninhabitants of the Jungle\nof Nool. Aimed at chil-dren, the character of Jojo\n(Anna Barnes), a young\ninhabitant of Whoville\nwith an overzealous\nimagination, allows the\nyoung audience to connect to the performance.\nThemes of acceptance,\nbullying and loyalty are\nexplored with the mantra\n\u201cA person\u2019s a person, no\nmatter how small\u201d repeated throughout.\nThe Cat in the Hat,\nplayed by Marc Pickering,\ndeservesaspecialmention\nas his perfect choreography and impeccable\ncomedic timing brings the\nwhole show together. The\nway Pickering moves and\nholds himself means that\ndespite not looking very\ncat-like, the children are\nfully convinced that he\nis in fact The Cat in the\nHat. The costumes are\nall subtle but effective\n\u2013 no cheap face-painted\nanimals here! There are\na few instances where\nPickering performs silent\ncomedic scenes, a little\nlike Tom and Jerry. They\nare seamlessly executed\nand allow even the\nyoungest children, who\nmay not be following the\nplot, to have a giggle.\nDisappointingly, the\nextremely talented Ngozi\nUgoh (portraying the Sour\nKangaroo) is given the\nleast solos, despite being\none of the most engaging\nand fun cast members. Her\nenergetic dancing, sassy\nmannerisms and amazing\nvoice give her the diva\nquality that captivates the\nentire audience, no matter\nhow small.\nThe plot is one problem\narea. The story is unsur-prisingly too simple for\nthe adults in the room\nand yet too complicated\nand dragged out for the\nyoungerchildrentofollow.\nOther than breaking\ninto impressive dance\nnumbers, the disconnected performance lacks the\ncrafted perfection of Dr.\nSeuss\u2019s works. Horton the\nElephant, played by Scott\nPaige, epitomizes all the\nproblems with the pro-duction. Firstly, he is the\nonly character dressed in\nordinary clothes and it is\noften hard to believe that\nPaige is anything other\nthan a paid actor. Paige is\ngiven many solos, which\nwere the lowest energy\nparts of the performance,\na problem when the room\nis full of children with\nshort attention spans.\nThese ballads are important for moving the story\nalong, but, as much of the\naudience is not even lis-tening, they do not serve\ntheir purpose. To make\nthings worse, these scenes\nhave very little in terms of\nvisuals: no choreography,\nno colourful costumes,\nnothing.\nIt must be said that\nother than the handful of\nmoments where Horton\ntakes centre stage, the\nchoreography, colours and\nstaging are a huge strength\nand, along with the fun\nsongs, the main selling\npoint of the performance.\nWith a small cast of only\ntwelve and a single set,\ncreative staging and\nmultipurpose props allow\nfor the scenes to come\nalive. The distractions\ncaused by the complex\nchoreography also allow\nactors to sneak away for\na quick costume change,\nand be back before\nanyone realizes they are\ngone. The drastic costume\nchanges, along with the\ndistinct mannerisms of\neach character, makes it\nhard for adults, let alone\nchildren, to see that the\nactors are in fact the same.\nThis performance\nis definitely aimed at\nchildren and families and\nfor the most part works\nperfectly for this target\naudience. It was slightly\ncomic how many children\nwere scared by the overzealous singing of The\nCat in the Hat: tears were\nshed! Fortunately, the cast\nplays off any crying or\neven heckling (from a 7\nyear old!) and, throughout\nthe performance, interacts\nwith the children, shaking\ntheir hands, having a\nquick chat and even a\nlittle dance. Overall,\nthis is a high energy\nperformance which runs\nonly 75 minutes and can\nbe enjoyed by the whole\nfamily.\nARTS\nEamon Farhart\nArts Writer\nWhere? Southwark playhouse\nWhen?

Third year was\na different story, like\nmany others, I applied for\ncompanies that interest\nme, refined my CV, wrote\ncover letters, etc. But,\nunlike many others, I had\nzero offers back and that\nhit me hard. For a short\nwhile.\nI decided to take a break\nfrom all the corporate\npressure and coursework,\nI went to my aunt\u2019s place\nin London for a refreshing\nweekend. During that\ntime, my mind was clear\nenough to ponder what I\nreally wanted to do, soon\nfollowed by a moment\nof excitement when I\nconcluded that I would\nstart a summer social\nproject. Something new,\nsomething impactful, it\nwas a mixed feeling of\nexcitement and confusion\nas I also had no idea of\nhow I would approach this\nchallenge. The plan, the\nexecution, the end goal,\neverything was a blur\nother than the location.\nIt needed to be Genting\nVillage, Tioman Island in\nMalaysia; where I spent\nmy last two summers\nworking as a tour guide.\nAll I could remember from\nthe times were flashbacks\nof locals openly burning\ntheir garbage and causing\npollution. Surely there\u2019s\nsome waste management\nproblem to be fixed, right?\nIt was May 2018, supposedly my project wass\ngoing to start in August\n2018. Things got slow\nafter that weekend, after\nthat initial rush of adren-aline. I knew majority of\nthe work would be done\non-site, but procrastination was real. I would\nput the project at the top\nof my to-do-list and I\u2019d\nstill do nothing. The only\ntasks I accomplished\nwithin that three months\u2019\ngap was a 6-hour reading\ninto the general waste\nmanagement system and\ngetting a logo done by\nmy friend). The rationale\nbehind that was, once\nI publicise the logo on\nsocial media, telling the\nworld about my summer\nsocial project, there\u2019s no\nturning back. The public\nis my invigilator.\nIt\u2019s 1st\nAugust 2018 and\nI\u2019ve just landed in Genting\nVillage, Tioman Island,\nafter a gruesome 9-hour\nbus ride plus a 2-hour ferry\nride. In the beginning few\ndays, I was uneasy about\neverything. What if there\nis not a problem for me to\nsolve? What if the locals\ndespise my project? What\nif I fail? The moment\nI stopped asking those\n\u201cWhat If\u201d questions was\nthe time that I got to work.\nRoadblock number one \u2013\npsychological problems.\nI started by talking to the\nlocals about my project.\nThe government cleaning\nworker, the guys that\nplayed volleyball, the\nresort owner, the son of\nthe head of village, the\nbride of the son of the\nhead of village. I was\ntalking to everyone. Out\nof the people I met and\ntalked to, many of them\nended up playing a big\nrole in my project.\nThe first relevant guy I\nmet was Alvin, where we\nmet in another village on\nthe island. We met online\nafter I found a 4 year old\nblog written by Alvin\nabout implementing recycling policy on the island.\nAlvin was brilliant, he\nwas friendly and he told\nme about the whole story\nof them coming about\nincreasing the recycling\npercentage of the village,\nhow and why they design\nthey recycling bin this\nway, etc. I took Alvin\u2019s\nadvice and was thinking\nof doing it in Genting\nVillage. Two or three days\nlater, I met roadblock\nnumber two \u2013 funding.\nWhat Alvin did was only\npossible with some grants.\nHowever, what Alvin\ngave me was something\nmore influential, my first\nhope and confidence that\nthings can be done on this\nisland if you believe in it.\nAlvin soon introduced\nme to Hisyam, a crazy\ndude that lives in a hut by\nthe beach, does in-house\nrecycling for Alvin\u2019s\nvillage, and organises\nsurfing competitions for\nRed Bull during monsoon\nseason. Red Bull, mate,\nRed Bull. I must meet the\nguy. Hisyam was really\ntalkative, and when he\nheard about my initiative,\nhe was very supportive\nand started throwing me\nideas and promised me his\nhelp. I was very thankful\nfor his support and his\nideas were solid and prac-tical.\nSoon after I met\nHisyam, I met Z, a resort\nowner from Genting\nVillage. Z is a passionate\nguy when it comes to\nenvironmental sustaina-bility. A couple years ago,\nZ tried to start a recycling\nmovement in the village\nbut his lone effort was\nsadly ignored. He saw my\narrival as an indication\nfor him to restart his old\nproject and make something happen. Two hours\ninto our first meeting, over\na cup of tea, we\u2019d become\nProject logo // Yee Ting Hong\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nDECEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nesoc@imperial.ac.uk SUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nDECEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nesoc@imperial.ac.uk\nSUSTAINABILITY\nYan Kai Kee\nSustainability Writer\npartners for the project.\nJust like that. Finally, one\nthing that was happening\nin my favour.\nTwo weeks into the\nproject, I realised I was\nrushing. I was taking in\nideas from people and\nwanting to do it all. At the\ntime, I was still doubting\nmyself a lot. Adding onto\nthat is the pressure of not\ncompleting the project in\ntime. Perfect cocktail for\na morning anxiety attack.\nI made the rational choice\nand took a day-off. A day\nwhere I slept till noon\nand had nothing on my\nmind other than chilling.\nAfter the well-rested day,\nI started from scratch and\ndrew out a \u2018big picture\u2019\nmap of the waste route\nof the village. Generally,\nwaste from businesses\nand locals are gathered\nat one location and get\nsent to the incinerator\nin another village. In\nthe words of Alvin and\nHisyam, the incineration\nprocedure is \u201cnot done\nproperly\u201d, causing air\nand water pollution to the\nsurrounding ecosystem.\nHitting the reset button\nAn unconventional way to spend your Summer\nFirst meeting with Alvin // Yan Kai Kee\nwas the right decision as\nnow the goal was clear\n\u2013 try and get as many\nrecyclables to be sent to\nthe in-house recycling\ncentre of Hisyam. Killing\ntwo birds with one stone;\nnot only will that increase\nthe recycling awareness\nof the village, at the same\ntime it indirectly reduces\nthe pollution, with less\nwaste being sent to the\nmain facilities.\nProposing that simple\nsolution to Hisyam and\nZ, the logistical route of\nrecyclables was easily\nlaid out as three of us had\na meeting over a cup of\ntea. Z being the passionate\nlocal decided to allocate\nsome space in his resort\nfor recyclables collection,\nbefore being sent out\nto Hisyam\u2019s recycling\nhouse. With that, we met\nroadblock number three \u2013\nthe lack of local support.\nHow are we going to\nmotivate the business and\nMeeting Hisyam in his recycling house // Yan Kai Kee\nlocals of Genting Village\nto recycle? Rather than\nthinking far ahead, we\nfigure the first step would\nbe informing them about\nthe new recycling route\nthat\u2019ll benefit our environment i.e. raising aware-ness. We came out with\nmany ideas like volleyball\ncompetitions and cleaning\nsessions but settled on a\ndoor-to-door campaign\nwhere a group of us would\ngather one morning and\nwalk the entire village (12\nresorts and 120 locals),\ntelling everyone about the\ngood news.\nDuring the campaign\nday, we manage to gather\naround ten passionate\nvolunteers (mainly divers\nbecause everyone knows\nhow much they love the\nenvironment) and began\nour six-hour campaign.\nKnocking on people\u2019s\ndoors with a hand-drawn\nmap, we started talking\npassionately about the\nnew route that will help\nprotect our environment\neven more. The response\nwe got? Some remark-able, some remained\nneutral and some straight\nup ignored our message.\nAnyway, we got the\nmessage across and even\nsparked some healthy\ndiscussions about how\nwe can help protect the\nbeautiful environment of\nthe island better. One conversation with a Chinese\nchef stuck with me. His\napproach towards food\nwaste? Let the monitor\nlizard on the island eat\nthem. His also raised\nanother problem about\nopenly burning polyfoam,\nas that\u2019s the only material\nthat can allow him to bring\nfresh seafood in from the\nmainland. Perhaps my\nnext project can focus on\nthat? (GWWet a real job\nKai)\nTwo days after the\ncampaign is where I\nended my own journey.\nAfter the project, I went\nback to my hometown\nto spend some time\nwith my family before\nheading back to the UK\nfor my final year. I rarely\ncontact Z, Hisyam and\nAlvin anymore as other\npriorities start creeping\ninto my life (job applications *cough *cough). All\nin all, the entire project\nwas not straightforward,\nif anything, the whole\nprocess was filled with\ncurveballs, sharp turns,\nstagnant procrastination,\ntwist and spikes. However,\nthis is what makes the\nproject worth remember-ing. Five, ten years down\nthe road, you ain\u2019t going\nto remember the smooth\nsails in life but rather the\nhardship and people you\nmet as you struggle and\nstumble across challeng-es. Be brave enough to\ntake the first step, and let\nthe world guide you to\nyour next destination.\nZ dancing to music // Yan Kai Kee\nVolunteers for the door-to-door campaign // Yan Kai Kee\n\n"

There were very\nfew ambitious projects\ndropped this year and\nnot enough artists took\nrisks with their music. J.\nCole\u2019s KOD is a prime\nexample. Although a very\ngood album, with it being\nfeatureless again, it felt\nlike he produced much of\nthe same.\nKanye attempted\nto shake things up but\nthat whole June weekly\nseven-track album experiment was just a hot mess.\nFrom that mess, the only\nalbums that are even in\nend-of-year conversations\nare Pusha T\u2019s Daytona\nand KIDS SEE GHOSTS.\nHaving said that, there\nare some honourable\nmentions that couldn\u2019t\nquite make this list. From\nstellar projects from\nseasoned veterans like\nNipsey Hussle (Victory\nLap) and Royce da 5\u20199\u2019\u2019\n(Book of Ryan), to impressive sophomore efforts\nfrom lesser known artists\nlike Noname (Room 25),\nSaba (CARE FOR ME)\nand Dreamville-signee\nJ.I.D. (DiCaprio 2),\nlet\u2019s get into 2018\u2019s top\nhip-hop albums.\nvery nearly made my list\nbut, in the end, I had to\ngo for my guy Kendrick.\nThe Black Panther film\nwas a moment and this\nsoundtrack, curated by\nKendrick, complemented\nit well. This album may\nalso be the closest we\nwill ever get to having a\nBlack Hippy album so we\nshould relish what we can\nwhile we can.\nInvasion of Privacy //\nWikimedia\nOxnard // Genius\nTV star and Instagram\npersonality to the first\nfemale rapper to claim\nthe top spot on the Hot\n100 chart since Lauryn\nHill in 1998. Her breakout\nsingle, \u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019,\nwas a ubiquitous smash\nand pressure mounted\nahead of the release of\nher debut album. I was\nintrigued to hear what\na Cardi B album would\neven sound like and to\nsee how she would handle\nthe pressure and weight\nof expectation on her\nshoulders. With Invasion\nof Privacy, Cardi delivers\na surprisingly impressive\ndebut album which is an\nenjoyable listen all round.\nWith Nicki Minaj\u2019s antics\nin 2018 showing that she\u2019s\nabsolutely done out here,\nCardi has cemented her\nposition as the new Queen\nof rap.\nsounds as focused as ever.\nEven the album cover\nscreams focus. Meek\nMill has been stalked by\nthe system for almost the\nentirety of his adult life,\nfollowing a gun charge\nwhen he was 18, and,\nalthough Meek Mill has\nalways used his music to\ndiscuss the flaws in the\nAmerican criminal justice\nsystem, the message now\nsounds more urgent and\npressing on this album.\nThis discussion comes to\na head on the Rick Ross\nand Jay Z assisted \u2018What\u2019s\nFree\u2019, on which Jay spits\none of the best verses I\u2019ve\never heard. One criticism\nof the album is that it\u2019s\na bit long but if you\u2019re\ngoing to fit in both the\ntypical Meek Mill tracks\nstunting about money,\ncars and jewellery, and\na serious conversation\nabout prison reform on to\none album, what do you\nexpect?\ntracks long and 1 hour\n28 minutes is too long.\nHowever, in this case, it\u2019s\ncause for celebration; after\nkeeping it from us for four\nyears, Birdman finally\nfreed up the ting! Tha\nCarter V is one of those\nrare albums that actually\nlived up to the insatiable\nhype that had built up\nwhile we waited patiently.\n\u2018Dedicate\u2019 starts with the\ndeclaration, \u201cif it wasn\u2019t\nfor Wayne, it wouldn\u2019t\nbe!\u201d, and this album serves\nas a necessary reminder\nof Wayne\u2019s impact on\nthe game. Lil Wayne\u2019s\ninfluence pervades the\ncurrent hip-hop scene;\nhe\u2019s basically fathered\nhalf the game and his\nlegacy deserves respect.\nWayne packs this album\nwith more bars than seems\npossible and reminds\nus why he deserves to\nbe mentioned in GOAT\nconversations (he\u2019s firmly\nin my personal top five).\nOn \u2018Dope New Gospel\u2019,\nWayne spits, \u201cthank God\nWeezy back / Order is\nrestored, all is right with\nthe world\u201d.

Jay Rock\u2019s\nRedemption was an\nexcellent showing and\nI wasn\u2019t actually\nfeeling this album the\nfirst time I listened to it. It\ntook me a few spins to get\ninto it because Smino\u2019s\nmusic has such a weird\nvibe to it. With his unique\nblend of melodic singing/\nrapping, it\u2019s often difficult\nto understand what Smino\nis saying. There\u2019s a lot\ngoing on in this album\nand Smino includes a\nhost of skits and different\nvoices which make the\nalbum difficult to follow\nat times. However, it is\nimportant to appreciate\nthat this is a reflection of\nhis creativity. This album\nis undoubtedly a vibe and\na solid follow up to 2017\u2019s\nBlkswn.\n8.\nOxnard\nAnderson .Paak\nIt feels strange to say\nthat I was left slightly\ndisappointed by Anderson\n.Paak\u2019s album. Prior to\nhearing it, I thought that\nCheeky Andy would\ndeliver the album of the\nyear with Oxnard. Unfortunately, although it is\nstill a very good album,\nOxnard is not that. What\nOxnard is, is a typically\nfunky, groovy, summery\nproject filled with no bad\nsongs and many enjoyable\nfunny skits. The strength\nof the features on this\nalbum is indicative of how\nwell-respected Anderson\n.Paak is in modern\nhip-hop.\nCardi B\u2019s meteoric rise\nto the pinnacle of hip-hop\nwill go down as the stuff\nof legend. In two years,\nCardi B transitioned\nfrom stripper to reality\n6.\nChampionships\nMeek Mill\nChampionships // Rap-Up\nEver since \u201cgetting\nbodied by a singing\nnigga\u201d and taking an L in\nhis 2015 beef with Drake,\nMeek Mill has held\nmore than his fair share\nof Ls.

It is\nalmost like Travis has\nmoulded his career after\nKanye West\u2019s early career\nbecause Astroworld feels\nlike Travis Scott\u2019s Graduation moment. That is to\nsay, the moment his music\ntranscends hip-hop and\nreceives mainstream recognition and accolades.\nFollowing the success of\nhis two early mixtapes\nOwl Pharoah and Days\nBefore Rodeo in growing\na cult following, and\nthe success of his two\nprevious albums Rodeo\nand Birds in the Trap Sing\nMcKnight in cultivating\nthis following, Astroworld\nappears to be the album to\npropel Travis Scott to the\nsuperstar status only held\nby artists like Kendrick\nLamar, Drake and J. Cole.\nAstroworld is a crisp\nlisten and the album takes\nlisteners on a chaotic rollercoaster journey guided\nby Travis Scott\u2019s unique\nmusical vision.\nEVERYTHING IS LOVE //All\nMusic\nAstroworld // Wikimedia Swimming // Wikimedia Scorpion // Amazon\nOn reflection, Jay-Z is\nactually lucky he cheated\non Beyonc\u00e9 with \u201cBecky\nwith the good hair\u201d.\nHis infidelity spawned\na world tour and three\namazing albums, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, Jay-Z\u2019s\n4:44 and now this.\nLemonade was Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s abrasive warning shot\nto Jay-Z, addressing his\ncheating and declaring\nshe is not a woman to\nbe messed with. After\nsounding uninspired on\n2013\u2019s Magna Carta Holy\nGrail, Jay-Z delivered a\nmasterpiece and one of the\nbest albums of 2017 with\nhis apology album, 4:44.\nEVERYTHING IS LOVE is\na celebration of love. Not\nto sound moist but, when\nI listen to this album, I\ncan\u2019t help but think, \u201ctheir\nlove is so pure\u201d. Beyonc\u00e9\nreally rides for Jay and\nthe post-infidelity Carters\nembody black love at its\nfinest. That is not to say\nthat black love involves\ninfidelity (I don\u2019t know\nif I\u2019ll ever fully forgive\nJay for jeapordising the\n\u201cBlack Men Don\u2019t Cheat\u201d\nmovement) or that women\nshould tolerate cheating\njust because Beyonc\u00e9 did.\nAlthough, to an extent,\nthis sounds like a Beyonc\u00e9\nalbum with Jay-Z on it, it\nsounds truly collaborative\nand Beyonce proves she\u2019s\na better rapper than most\nof the game right now.\nAlso, it can\u2019t be overstated\nhow important the narrative around building black\ngenerational wealth on\nthe album is. The Carters\nremain relationship goals.\nTies\u2019 and \u2018Can\u2019t Take a\nJoke\u2019, we all owe Pusha\nT a debt of gratitude for\ndishing out the fattest L\nand forcing Drake to get\nin his bag and give us the\nalbum we deserve.\nbeing a basketballer and\nSteph\u2019s shooting ability\ndoesn\u2019t mean he overtakes\nLebron as the best player\nalive, making hit songs is\nonly one aspect of being\na rapper and has little\nbearing on the quality of\nDrake\u2019s albums. Having\nsaid all that, it\u2019s impossible to overlook the\nsheer number of potential\nhits on Scorpion, from\n\u2018Nonstop\u2019 to \u2018After Dark\u2019.\nAt 25 tracks and 90\nminutes, Scorpion is\nsimply too long. However,\nthe fact that it\u2019s a double\ndisk album somehow\nmade it easier for me\nto simply discard the\ntracks I don\u2019t like from\nwhat is a bloated album.\nOnce I did the necessary\nfat trimming, removing\ntracks which appeal to a\ndifferent type of Drake\nfan to me, like \u2018Peak\u2019,\n\u2018Summer Games\u2019 (which\nsounds like progressive\nchurch music to me) and\n\u2018Ratchet Happy Birthday\u2019,\nI was left with a custom\nScorpion which gave me\neverything I needed from\nDrake in 2018.\n*I know what you\u2019re\nthinking. \u201cAndy, didn\u2019t\nyou just say don\u2019t let\nDrake\u2019s hit-making distract you from the quality\nof the album itself? You\ncan\u2019t just cut out the songs\nyou don\u2019t like and say the\nremaining tracks are album of the year?\u201d\nI\u2019m sorry but I just\ncan\u2019t ignore the hits on\nmy custom Scorpion:\n1.

Of the\ntwo, I lean toward Mac\nMiller\u2019s, simply because\nSwimming provides a\ndifferent vibe - something\nto chill to.\nMac Miller had been\non a musical journey of\ncreative development and\nhis last album, The Divine\nFeminine, proved that\nthe days of \u2018Easy Mac\nwith the Cheesy Raps\u2019\nwere long gone. After\neffectively dedicating\nThe Divine Feminine\nto his love for Ariana\nGrande and, following the\ncouple\u2019s ensuing public\nbreakup, I was expecting\nSwimming to be a bitter\nbreakup album. However,\nwith Swimming, Mac\ndelivered a mature album\naddressing his personal\nstruggle with mental\nhealth, suicidal thoughts\nand addiction. He poetically described dealing\nwith these as floating and\ndrowning simultaneously.\nThe album sounded like\nit was a turning point for\nhim, however his contant\nbattle with his demons,\nnamely depression and\nsubstance abuse, ultimately cost him his life. Mac\nMiller sadly passed away\non 7th\nSeptember, at age\n26. The only thing left to\nsay is R.I.P. Mac Miller.\nYour music touched\na generation and will\ncontinue to live on for\nyears to come.\nThe fact that Scorpion\nlands so highly on my list\nis not an indication of the\nquality of the album but\nmore an indictment on the\nstate of hip-hop in 2018.\nDrake has had a very interesting 2018. After seeing\nthe end of his phenomenal\neight-year Billboard Hot\n100 Streak finally come\nto an end in a quiet end\nto 2017 (by his own\nlofty standards), Drake\nsuddenly faced doubts\nand questions about his\nlegacy and whether he\nwas slowly passing his\npeak. Drake addressed\nthis when he says, \u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen gone since like\nJuly, niggas actin\u2019 like I\ndied\u201d, in his feature verse\non Blocboy JB\u2019s \u2018Look\nAlive\u2019. This track marked\nthe start of Drake\u2019s 2018\nassault on the charts and\nhe has since virtually been\nan ever present in the Top\nTen, breaking the previous\nrecord of 28 weeks at\nNumber One with tracks\nlike \u2018God\u2019s Plan\u2019, \u2018Nice\nfor What\u2019 and the infectious \u2018In My Feelings\u2019.\n2018 seemed to be going\nto plan for Drake. That is,\nuntil Pusha T happened.\nBy revealing Drake\u2019s\nbaby momma drama\n(\u201cYOU ARE HIDING A\nCHILD!\u201d) on his scathing\ndiss track \u2018The Story of\nAdidon\u2019, Pusha T handed\nDrake a crushing L\nand effectively ruined\nhis otherwise immaculate album rollout. We\nwill never know what\nScorpion would have\nsounded like had Drake\nnot taken an L but, with\nthe beef spawning tracks\nlike \u20188 Out Of 10\u2019, \u2018Mob\n\u201cYOU ARE\nHIDING A\nCHILD!\u201d\nDrake\u2019s success has\ngarnered a hugely diverse\nfollowing, meaning that\nit is almost impossible\nfor him to cater to all of\nhis fans.

This\nfranchise made its debut\nin 1998 on the Nintendo\n64 and has appeared on\nevery Nintendo home\nconsole since: with Melee\non the Gamecube, Brawl\non the Wii and SSB4 on\nthe Wii U and N3DS.\nFor those who do not\nknow, the Super Smash\nBros series is a massive\ncrossover Nintendo\nfighting game that features\nyour favourite characters\nfrom a whole range of\nNintendo franchises to\n3rd party characters from\nother iconic video game\nseries.\nWho\u2019s here?\nEveryone is here!\nSSBU brings back every\ncharacter who has made\na playable appearance in\nthe franchise so far \u2013 so\nSolid Snake and Ice\nClimbers who were cut\nin SSB4 are now back on\nthe roster. Moreover, we\nnow have echo fighters\n(clones), which allow new\ncharacters to be brought\ninto smash. These echo\nfighters play similarly to\nexisting characters with\ndifferent appearances.\nReturning characters who\nhave been rebranded as\necho fighters include\nLucina (Marth) and Dark\nPit (Pit).\nAdditionally, Sakurai\nhas brought some iconic\nnewcomers such as the\nfamous Inklings from\nSplatoon and the guy that\neveryone thought was too\nbig for Smash \u2013 Ridley.\nKing K Rool from the\nDonkey Kong series\nmakes his debut alongside\nCastlevania\u2019s Simon\nBelmont (Richter will be\nhis echo fighter). Speaking\nof echo fighters, Princess\nDaisy, Fire Emblem\u2019s\nChrom, Dark Samus and\nStreet Fighter\u2019s Ken will\nbe making their playable\nSmash debuts as echo\nfighters Peach, Roy,\nSamus and Ryu respec-tively. Isabelle will have\nher own moveset and will\nnot be an echo fighter of\nthe Villager. So many new\ncharacters! But that\u2019s still\nnot everyone. Incineroar\nfrom Pokemon Sun and\nMoon and Piranha Plant\nwill also be playable characters \u2013 though Piranha\nPlant is a pre-order bonus.\nExcited? Well, there\u2019s\ngoing to be at least five\nmore characters released\nin the upcoming DLC\npacks, so the fighters will\nWith new characters\nalso comes new game\nmodes.\nSmashdown is a mode\nwhere your previously\nselected character\nbecomes unavailable\nfor the next round. This\nmeans players have to\nlearn to adapt and cannot\njust rely on their main.\nSquad Strike can be\nplayed as either a 3-on-3\nor a 5-on-5 elimination\nbattle. Players will cycle\nthrough their fighters consecutively until a winner\nis determined.\nThe training mode\nin Ultimate is new and\nimproved, now with\nlaunch distance and trajectory displayed.\nWorld of Light\nIt\u2019s been almost ten\nyears since the Smash\nseries had a proper story\nmode. The Subspace\nEmissary in Brawl was an\ninteresting way to engage\nplayers and make them\nconnect to the characters.\nThe cinematic cutscenes\nadded depth and an extra\ndimension to the Smash\nBros experience. It was\nalso a great way of unlocking characters, as you\nadded them to your party\nduring the story.\nNow ten years on\nwe have the World of\nLight, which Sakurai and\nNintendo are keeping\nunder complete wraps.\nWhat we do now so far is\nthat there is a new villain,\nGaleem, only Kirby\nmanages to escape his\nattack on all the fighters.\nYou now take control of\nKirby as you navigate\nthe World of Light to find\nyour friends (both fighters\nand spirits) and discover\nthe mysteries of this\nworld.\nSimilar to Brawl, you\u2019ll\nunlock the majority of the\ncharacters in the story\nmode.\nWhat are these\nSpirits?\nThere has been a\nmention of spirits, but\nwhat exactly are these\nspirits and how do they\nimpact the game?\nSpirits are game\ncharacters which can be\nequipped to your fighter to\nboost their stats in a battle.\nThere are two categories\nof spirits, Primary and\nSupport. Primary spirits\nraise the attack power of\nyour fighter and come in\nthree types: Attack, Grab,\nShield. Like rock, paper\nand scissors, the types\nhave advantages over\neach other: attack beats\ngrab which beats shield\nwhich beats attack. So\nmake sure to choose your\nspirit well.\nGameplay\nMelee (and Project M)\nfans rejoice! The fighting\nmechanics in Ultimate\nwill be tailored towards\nthe gameplay that made\nmelee popular. Picking\nwhich direction you can\ndodge mid-air is now back\nto allow you to quickly\navoid enemy attacks.\nDon\u2019t be over-reliant on\ndodges though; overusing\nthem will reduce their\neffectiveness over time.\nSuper Smash Bros\nUltimate is available\nnow (as of Friday 7th\nDecember 2018) on the\nNintendo Switch.\nEveryone is here and here is everything you should know.\nISSUE 1708\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\njust keep coming. Given\nthe shocking DLC characters for SSB4, no one\ncan predict which fighters\nwill be joining the Smash\nroster over the next few\nyears.\nP l a y a b l e\nWaluigi?\nDespite some dreams\ncoming true (Ridley fans\ncan finally wipe their\ntears), Waluigi will be\nmaking an appearance\nin Super Smash Bros\nUltimate \u2013 as an assist\ntrophy.\nNew Modes\nEveryone is here // Nintendo\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1708\nFELIX\n12\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAnd then what?\nThe Tory party is wrestling like Laco\u00f6n with its own ideological demons. Is this when the oldest\npolitical edifice in the world falls?\nCOMMENT\nCalum Drysdale\nComment Writer\nA\nt some point,\nthis Brexit\nnonsense must\nend. Reason,\nthough seemingly in\nshort supply nowadays,\ndemands it. Any transition\nperiod will come to an\nend. Any backstop will\nbe withdrawn from and a\nnew norm for the country\nwill arrive, however\nuneasily. The question is\nwhether this new norm\nwill arrive for the Tories.\nOnce known for their\nruthless pragmatism the\nConservative party has\nserved as the \u2018safe pair of\nhands\u2019 ever since Disraeli.\nHis phrase \u2018One nation\nconservatism\u2019, meant the\nprotection of all classes\nthrough measures to\nreduce class differences\nand improve the lot of\nthe common man through\nsensible, paternalistic\npolicy that is at its heart\nnon-ideological. This\nmanifested itself most\nstrongly in support for\nLabour\u2019s National Health\nService and the Welfare\nstate. This support was not\njust an electoral necessity\nbut instead an alignment\nof ideology characteristic\nof the post-war consensus,\nthe period between 1945\nand Thatcher defined by\nnationalisation, strong\ntrade unions, strong reg-ulation, high taxes, and\na generous welfare state.\nUniversities were built,\na national curriculum\ndevised and economic\nintegration with Europe\nand the capitalist world\nwas encouraged. The state\nwas recognised as being\nvital to maintaining a\nfunctioning society and a\nmixed economy was the\nnorm.\nThen in the 70\u2019s with\nFriedman, the Laffer\ncurve and Thatcher, the\nTory party made a sudden\nabout turn. Suddenly,\nthe old Keynesian\nattitude that government\nintervention to inject\nmoney into an economy\nwas necessary to fight a\nrecession was cast out\nand the country changed\nas a result. The message\nbecame one of tax cuts\nand money trickling\ndown. Thatcher worked\nhard to cut and scrimp and\nsave and young Tories\ncoming up the ranks at the\ntime took her message to\nheart, gold plated it and\nmade of it an ideology. To\nthem regulation was re-strictive, tariffs abhorrent\nand quotas the work of\nhell, meant only to stifle\nan economy. This, not\nanger over loss of control,\nfuels the Hard Brexiteers of the Economic\nResearch Group (ERG)\nReese-Moggs\u2019 personal\nmouthpiece. The belief\nthat once freed from the\nshackles of super-gov-ernmental control, Britain\nwill be able to become a\nnew Singapore, a haven\nfor international business.\nI personally don\u2019t think\nthat it is likely. When parroting the fact that Britain\nis the world\u2019s fifth largest\neconomy, the ERG forgets\nwhat the world in fact\nlooks like. Both the US\nand China have the might\nto demand such concessions from Britain that any\nagreement would likely\nlook more like patronage\nrather than partnership.\nJapan may be won around\nbut Germany will certainly not. This leaves Britain\nscrabbling around to form\na patchwork of deals with\ncountries smaller and less\nsignificant than itself.\nI do not believe that\nBrexit will deliver an\neconomic bounty and\nneither does the House\nof Commons Exiting\nthe European Union\nCommittee. This will be\npunished by voters. I hate\nto be the one to say \u2018It\u2019s\nthe economy stupid\u2019 but\nit is in fact the economy.\nStooopid.\nThe only way that\nthe Tories can hope to\nremain a relevant political\nforce is to acknowledge\nthe mistakes that they\nhave made and to regain\nthe centre ground that\nthey seceded. Voters are\nworried about Corbyn\nin when standards fall.\nEducation is the best way\nof\nlevelling the socio-eco-nomic playing field.\nSuccess will be when\nprivate schools close\nbecause parents recognise\nthe world class level of\nour state system; rail\nnationalisation and the\nbuilding of a trans-Pen-nine service. If Brexit\nbrings with it a compulsory period of withdrawal\nfrom the world stage then\nrather than focusing on\nLondon, money must be\nfound to balance out the\nNorth-South divide. A\nrecent study has found\nthat the North has suffered\na brain drain going back\n200 years. This is unacceptable and could be\nchallenged by supporting\nurban regeneration and\nhouse building schemes\nin Northern cities; an\nexpansion of social care\nto include prevention of\ndiseases such as obesity\nand cardiovascular disease\nand geriatric care. These\nare time bombs that have\nbeen shamefully ignored\nin the name of individual\nfreedom and must be acted\nagainst; Finally, Britain\nmust act independently\nof America on the world\nstage, projecting power\nvia the Royal Navy and\nbuilding a new consensus\nof how a major economy\ncan take care of its people.\nThese are the values\nthat must be regained if\nthe Tories hope to remain\nrelevant and why I despite\nsetbacks call myself a\n(small c) conservative.\nThe Conservative party tree has bits missing// Wikimedia\n\u201cAny\nagreement\nwith China\nand the US\nwould be\npatronage not\npartnership\u201d\nand his ability to lead the\ncountry but his message,\nhowever garbled and\nunclear, resonates. People\nwant to feel that the\ngovernment stands with\nthem against exploitative\nbusinesses not against\nthem. Citizens of this\ncountry have the right to\nbe protected, not preached\nto about how, in the long\nterm, cutting and austerity\nwill bring them greater\nfortune.\nA new \u2018one nation\u2019\npolicy platform might\nlook something like this;\na massive investment\nof money into schools\nnationwide. The bringing\nof academies under far\ncloser government control\nand being quicker to move\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1708\nFELIX\nTECH tecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nMedical Devices under the Spotlight\nT\nechnology has\nd r a m a t i c a l l y\nchanged every\naspect of life as\nwe know it, with medicine\nbeing one of the most important aspects. Medicine\nhas been revolutionized\nthrough medical imaging,\ndrugs, implants and more.\nWhat happens, however,\nwhen the medical device\nindustry fails? The\nInternational Consortium\nof Investigative\nJournalists (ICIJ) conducted a year-long global\nstudy on this and published their findings.\nTight regulations\nsurround the pharmaceutical industry, requiring a\nlarge amount of clinical\ntesting before being\napproved. While there\nare regulations put in\nplace for medical devices,\nthey aren\u2019t as rigid as for\ndrugs. As a result, medical\ndevices are put on the\nmarket faster and have a\nhigher chance of causing\nharm, such as puncturing\norgans, delivering errant\nshocks, poisoning blood\nand more, leading to\n\u201cexplant operations\u201d or\npermanent harm. So, what\ncould have led to such\nmistakes?\nFirstly, it is hard to\nfind reports on defective\ndevices. Some regula-tions, such as the ones in\npractice in the US until\n2017, allowed breast\nimplant companies to bury\nevidence of harm by not\npublicly disclosing their\nreports.When this practice\nstopped, the number of\ninjuries reported skyrock-eted. Outside of the US,\nit is even harder to obtain\ninformation. For instance,\nin Europe many reports\ncannot be disclosed or are\nnever collected in the first\nplace. Detailed data such\nas the number of devices\non the market and their use\nare also unknown. In other\nwords, there is no way to\ndo statistical analysis on\na device behaviour, and\nneither patients nor their\ndoctors can take informed\ndecisions.\nSecondly, we would\nexpect regulations\nsurrounding the health\ndomain to be extremely\nrigid. The reality is,\nregulations are a bit more\nlenient in the medical\ndevice industry. Some\ndevices sold on the market\nhave never been tested on\nhumans and only need to\nprovide \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of the product\u2019s\nsafety and effectiveness.\nFor some devices, it is\nenough to be \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to devices\nalready on the market or\nto an earlier version of\nthe product. They also do\nnot need to demonstrate\nthat the device delivers a\nbenefit to the patient.\nMoreover, Europe,\nwith some of the lightest\nregulations in the developed world, is seen as a\n\u201ctesting ground\u201d for big\ncorporations, waiting to\nsee the success of their\nproducts on the market\nbefore selling it in the\nUS. From the data that\nthe ICIJ journalists could\ngather during their inves-tigation, it is expected that\nthe number of reports of\ninjuries due to medical\nimplants will dramatically\nincrease, doubling in the\nUK in nine years, either\ndue to improved report\npractice or an increase in\ninjuries.\nThirdly, lobbyism plays\na role as well. When a\nmarket is concerned by\nregulations, the companies involved intervene\nwith representatives to\nattempt to have their\nviewpoint protected by\npoliticians. For nine years,\nlobbyists put pressure on\nrepresentatives during\nthe rewriting of plans to\nreform Europe\u2019s safety\nrules. During the whole\nprocess, as the ICIJ journalists claim, lobbyists\nfought to keep as much as\npossible from the \u201clighttouch safety regime\u201d.\nCurrently, the regime\nin Europe uses a range\nof for-profit certification\nfirms, the \u201cnotified\nbodies\u201d, to approve new\ndevices for market release\non behalf of the European\nUnion if they conform\nwith the regulations. They\nare supposed to look\nthrough technical files\nthat truthfully describe\nthe devices, including\nissues and testing, and\nthen decide whether they\nmeet the regulations.\nSometimes, notified\nbodies might have never\nseen these files and might\nhave loosely awarded\nthe CE certificates to\nunsafe implants for the\ncompanies that pay them\nfor their services. The\nEuropean Commission\nproposed to transfer responsibility for assessing\nhigh-risk devices to a\nnew department within\nthe European Medicines\nAgency.In2012,however,\na centralized regulator\nwas deemed \u201cinappropriate\u201d. According to the\nJournalists investigators,\nthe commission repeated\nlobbyist\u2019s arguments: increased costs for hospitals\nwith no increased safety\nto European citizens.\nAlthough there is no\nfundamental change in\nthe structure, new regulations will push for a\nstricter control of medical\ndevices.\nIt is important to note,\nhowever, that despite the\nharm that has been caused\nby faulty medical devices,\nthe general effect of the\ndevices on health is massively positive. Nothing\nis black and white. Health\nmanufacturers don\u2019t focus\nprimarily on increasing\nrevenue and decreasing\ncosts, but it is a consideration they need to have to\nkeep the company up and\nrunning, which will then\nallow them to produce\nmore devices that can revolutionize the healthcare\ndomain. Regulations do\nfail, but they still protect\nus from many mistakes.\nWe can decide to leave\nthings as they are, but as\nthe next generation of\nscientists and engineers,\nwe believe it is our role\nto positively contribute.\nMoral issues and fairness\nto stakeholders should be\nconsidered when creating\nany device. When regulating them, ethical\nbehaviour is important\nbecause finding dangers\nin a truthful description of\na device is easier than analysing lies. Finally, even\nafter devices have been\nreleased, follow-up is\nessential, and we believe\nthis area is dramatically\nunder-developed and\nwould have massive\nimpacts in the long run.\nScandals and criticism\nare central to raise awareness but constructively\nworking with all parties\ninvolved is even more\nvital.\nTECH\nAline Buat\nTech Writer\nMetal-on-metal hip implants such as Depuy\u2019s have been accused of being faulty by many UK patients// Dailymail\n\u201cIt is expected\nthat the\nnumber of\nreports of\ninjuries due\nto medical\nimplants will\ndramatically\nincrease\u201d\n\u201cWhile there\nare regulations\nput in place\nfor medical\ndevices, they\naren\u2019t as rigid\nas for drugs\u201d\nThisweekinthetechsection:TheICIJinvestigationintohowandwhythemedicaldeviceindustryisfailingglobally.\nKrithika Balaji\nTech Editor\n\n"

We are then\nasked to close our eyes\nand remember that \u201cYou\nare me\u201d. In this disarming\nway begins a play that\nsubtly whisks the audience into the complicated\nand human world of Idi\nAmin\u2019s Uganda, only to\nthen run them screaming\nout of it again. Telling the\nstory of poet and playwright Nick Makoha\u2019s\nescape from Uganda, this\nis the kind of show that\nyou dream about going to\nsee as a student.\nThe entire story is told\nby a single actor and\nactress. They spin and\nwhirl around each other,\nmoving from character\nto character \u2013 each one\ndefined less by the minor\nclothing changes but by\nthe huge changes the\nactors themselves make,\naltering voice and body\nlike contortionists to\nwelcome us into the world\nthey have created.\n\u201cAt every moment\non stage, there are these\ntwo characters. They are\nalways on stage. For an\nhour and 10 minutes these\ntwo actors have to be on\nall the time. It is very\nintense for the actors and\nthe audience,\u201d explains\nNick when I ask him\nabout it.\nMeeting Nick Makoha\nis like stepping onto a\ncruise liner. He hums with\na vast sub-audible energy\nand a mind made of bright\nand spinning wheels.\n\u201cThere is always the\nduality of the two charac-ters, the pairs that bounce\noff each other.\u201d. This is\nmore than just guff. The\nplay manages to make\nscenes alternatively very\nfull and very lonely. We\nmove from a crowded\nbus station onto the bus\n(or matatu) heading to the\nKenyan border \u2013 using\nonly some benches and a\nhanging structure representing the baggage rack\nof the bus, piled high with\npeoples\u2019 lives \u2013 to the\nlonely road plagued with\ncheckpoints and soldiers\nwho are a mix of high,\nbored and greedy.\nI ask him how he\nmanages to bring people\nwith him into the African\nworld of his childhood.\n\u201cWhen you are\nwatching Star Wars, you\ntotally believe you are\non Tatooine or the Death\nStar.\u201d He sighs; this is\na question, I think, that\nhe has answered before.\n\u201cPeople will think this\nisn\u2019t my world, but they\n[the actors] bring across\nthe humanity and allow\nyou to suspend your\ndisbelief \u2013 to make this\nyour story, make this a\nstory that you are willing\nto watch without ques-tioning, with the same\ninquisitiveness of a child\u201d\nHe goes on to talk\nabout how \u201cin many parts\nof the world people have\nwith the people there.\n\u201cI could say America is\nnice or I could show you\nsome Americans. I could\nsay that Uganda is a very\nstrange place or instead\nlet me tell you about this\nmother and her son.\u201d\nHe laughs. \u201cThough\nI am a metic. My metic\nexperience is unique and\nI cannot speak for all of\nthe continent\u201d Metic.\nThe word crops up again\nand again. Literally \u2018a\nforeigner living in an\nancient Greek city who\nhad some of the privileges\nof citizenship\u2019, the word\nhas come to represent\nthose immigrants stuck\nin a penumbra between\ntheir country of birth and\ntheir adopted country,\n\u201can increasingly common\nsituation nowadays\u201d.\nWhat Nick stresses\nover and over is that the\nplay was never intended\nto be about Uganda. It was\nmeant to be about people,\nUgandans, who had to flee\ntheir country of birth and\nset up a new home else-where. The play\u2019s greatest\nsuccess is how, even after\nthe words that begin the\nplay [\u201cYou are me\u201d] are\nan hour and ten in the\npast, Nick has been so\nsuccessful in his spinning\nof the world around the\naudience that when we\n\u2013 Nick and us \u2013 are confronted by the immigration officer at Heathrow\nasking why we don\u2019t\nhave the correct papers,\nit feels like an unjustified\nattack. We are made the\nimmigrant and it is hard\nand shocking. Having\ngrown accustomed to\nvoices speaking in a thick\nand easy Ugandan accent,\nthe sound of clipped and\ntoo-perfect vowels challenging us, questioning\nus, and doubting us hits\nlike a train. Nick Makoha\nhas crafted a masterpiece\nthat emerges from the\ntrue and silent dark of\nunlit Ugandan roads, not\nto challenge us but to\nwelcome us and ask us in\nits insistent and convincing tones to go forth and\nchallenge with it.\nAward-winningpoetNickMakohaturnshishandtotheatrewithashowpregnantwithbeauty.ArtswriterCalum\nDrysdale interviews him on his latest work, The Dark.\nNick Makoha has written a poignant and moving tale // Helen Murray\nISSUE 1708\nFELIX\n26\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nCalum Drysdale\nArts Writer\nWhere?

As\na uni student living on\na budget, the plight\nof Rodolfo (Jonathan\nTetelman), Marcello\n(Nicholas Lester),\nColline (David Soar)\nand Schaunard (Bo\u017eidar\nSmiljani\u0107) feels only too\nrelatable. Well-educated\nbut without proper jobs,\nthey talk of Demosthenes\nand the pleasures of high\nsociety while freezing in\na drafty garret. And who\nhasn\u2019t suffered from self-doubt about their work\nlike Roldofo, who burns\nhis five-act manuscript for\nkindling?\nThe witty repartee and\nexchanges of the four\nfriends are one of the best\nthings about La Boh\u00e8me,\nwith the original Italian\nlibretto the result of four\nyears\u2019intensive collaboration between Puccini and\nhis two librettists Giacosa\nand Illica. Amanda\nHolden\u2019s English trans-lation, thankfully, does\nit great justice: hilarious\nbanter flies back and forth\nbetween Lester, Tetelman,\nSoar and Smiljani\u0107, who\nportray the four friends\nwith effervescent camara-derie.\nThese moments of\nlevity in La Boh\u00e8me only\nmake the tragedies of\nthe play more acute. As\nColline and Schaunard\nbattle it out with ba-guettes, Musetta rushes in\nto tell them that Mimi is\ndying. It\u2019s a rollercoaster\ntrip that enthralls from\nstart to finish. But for it\nto work, the audience has\nto be invested in the love\nstory between Roldofo\nand Mimi that lies at the\nheart of La Boh\u00e8me. Here,\ngreat onstage chemistry\nbetween Tetelman and\nRomaniw makes their\nstory genuinely moving.\nThe scene when Mimi\nand Rodolfo brush hands\nin the dark has got to be\none of the most beautiful\npieces in opera. Tetelman\u2019s soaring, romantic\ntenor is a delight to the\near in the famous aria\n\u2018What a cold little hand\u2019,\nthough possibly a little\noverwrought even for a\npoet in love. Romaniw\u2019s\nresponse, \u2018Yes, they call\nme Mimi\u2019 is entirely\nin-character, appropriately measured and shy,\nwhile showing her voice\u2019s\nfull clarity and range \u2013 not\nan easy thing to do. What\nan ENO debut to make!\nIn fact, the acting from\nthe whole cast was on\npoint. Nadine Benjamin,\nfresh from ENO\u2019s recent,\nvery well-received Porgy\nand Bess, is especially\nenjoyable to watch as the\nvivacious Musetta, revelling flirtatiously in her\nsensuality.\nThis year marks the\nfourth revival of Jonathan\nMiller\u2019s classic produc-tion; watching it, it is\neasy to see why. Miller\nhas really captured the\nessence of the La Boh\u00e8me\nthat Puccini envisioned.\nSet in 1920s Paris, the set\nis wonderfully designed;\nthe sunlit second-floor\ngarret morphs quite\nmagically into a crowded\nParisian street outside the\nCaf\u00e9 Momus, and then\ninto a desolate alley on\na snowy winter evening.\nPlayful details and vignettes abound without\ndistracting from the main\naction, adding a touch of\nreality to the events on\nstage. With this produc-tion, all that is needed for\nperfection is a good set\nof singers. Fortunately,\nthe cast all deliver solid\nperformances, Romaniw\nespecially standing out as\nMimi.\nWith the orchestra\nplaying the swelling notes\nof Puccini under the masterful direction of Alexander Joel (a La Boh\u00e8me\nveteran, having conducted\nit over a hundred times), it\nis a fine evening of opera\nindeed. A treat for the\nears and eyes \u2013 and an\nemotional upheaval for\nthe heart!\nLet us tell you all about this amazing show, with prose written by experienced writers, well-versed in their chosen\ntopic.\nLa Boh\u00e8me at the ENO // ENO\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Theresa\nMay continues to push her Brexit\ndeal, and MPs continue\nto push back. The truth\nbecomes abundantly\nclear, that not one pol-itician, nor pundit truly\nknows what Brexit looks\nlike for the people of\nthis country. In this cli-mate, universities must\nreassure their staff and\nstudents alike, that their\nfutures are still secure.\nLast week, the Provost\nandPresidentsentanemail\nto all staff saying they\nare \u201cambitious about the\nfuture.\u201d They encouraged\nstaff to keep applying for\nEuropean research grants\nand to continue to recruit\nEU staff and students.\nThe College Brexit Advisory Group, they added,\nwere preparing contingency plans for all scenarios.\nThough what this actually\nmeans is unclear.\nThese are all hopeful\nstatements in an uncertain\ntime.\nStudents themselves\nhave had little reassurance\nso far. The government\nhas promised that EU students applying until 2019,\nwill be guaranteed the\nsame fee status as UK stu-dents. No promises have\nbeen made beyond that so\nfar. Though Imperial say\nthey are campaigning for\nthe government to provide\nclarification for the years\n2020 and 2021.\nOf all the student\npopulations in the UK,\nImperial\u2019s has the third\nlargest proportion of EU\nstudents. A fifth of Imperial\u2019s students are EU. More\nso than UCL, Oxford and\nCambridge.\nImperial received \u00a3141\nmillion in EU cash last\nyear and currently has\n317 projects funded by\nHorizon 2020 (second\nonly to UCL). The university more so than any\nother in this country will\nbe affected greatly by the\nUK leaving the European\nUnion.\nSo what does the future\nfor Imperial look like?\nWill the proportion of EU\nstudents have to fall in\nImperial, after Brexit? So\nfar the signs suggest that\nthey will not.\nVice Provost of Education, Simone E. Buitendijk, told Felix that student\napplication numbers\n\u201cboth from the EU and\nthe rest of the world, have\ncontinued to grow since\nthe Brexit vote\u201d.\nIt is widely assumed\nother major research\nintensive universities will\nfollow suit, and forge such\npartnerships with other\nEU universities. Buitendijk says the partnership\nwith Munich will also\nallow for \u201cnew student\nexchanges and summer\nschools.\u201d\nBuitendijk adds that the\nuniversity is campaigning\nfor \u201cvisa reforms that will\noffer easier access for\ninternational students to\ncome here and for recent\ngraduates to stay here\u201d.\nUltimately though,\neverything is up in the air,\nand there is only so much\nthe university can do to\nreassure us.\nSo for now, all Imperial\nstaff and students can do\nis wait until Tuesday\u2019s\nvote on May\u2019s Brexit deal,\nand hope for the best.\nImperial wants to retain EU links and perks for students and staff // Wikimedia\n\u201cWill the\nproportion of\nEU students\nhave to fall in\nImperial, after\nBrexit?\u201d\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nDECEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n6\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMoreover, Imperial\u2019s\nrecently acclaimed novel\npartnership with the\nTechnical University of\nMunich, could be a boon\nfor students too. The\npartnership, the first of its\nkind for a UK university,\nmeans that any new hires\nto Imperial, will work\njointly for both universi-ties. This allows the staff\nmember to still apply\nfor certain EU research\nprojects.\n\n"

    "content": "I\u2019m dreaming of a green Christmas\nA good christmas needn\u2019t cost the Earth . Here are some practical tips on how to make your christmas better for\nyour friends, your purse and the planet.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nMatilda Burridge\nSustainability Writer\nT\nables heaving\nwith plates of\nfood, stacks\nof presents\nspilling out from under a\ntree smothered in tinsel\nand baubles, and rolls\nof lights beaming into\nouter space\u2026 This may\nseem like the epitome of\nthe festive season, but\nis Christmas really not\nabout more than what\nwe consume? Christmas\nhas become synonymous\nwith over-indulgence -over-eating, drinking and\nspending. We feel compelled to make the best\nof the offers that are constantly thrown at us- even\nif we don\u2019t need, want or\neven like the products that\nwe are buying. What\u2019s\nmore, each year there is\npressure to improve upon\nthe previous one \u2013 by\nbuying and spending\nmore. But how much need\nfor this is there? Shouldn\u2019t\nwe stop to consider how\nmuch waste we are producing \u2013 all the excess\nfood, packaging, and\ngadgets we are churning\nout for this festive season?\nAt such a wasteful time of\nyear even making small\nchanges can make a difference to our impact on\nthe environment.\nWhen buying a new\nsmartphone do we\nconsider the hundreds of\nthousand workers at factories who work overtime\nto churn out gadgets and\ntrinkets at this time of\nyear? Do we consider\nwhat happens to all the\npackaging, or all the food\nwe throw away after a\nChristmas day roast? Is\nthis kind of gift-giving\nreally all so good? Could\nwe instead invest our\ntime and talents to make\na better Christmas for all?\n1. Plan ahead\nThe key to both a more\necological and economical Christmas lies in the\nplanning. Good intentions\nare often thrown to the\nwind in the last-minute\npanic to get everything\ndone. If you know exactly\nwhat you want to buy\nand where from, you can\npretty much finish your\nChristmas shopping in\none go, simultaneously\navoiding those hideously\nexpensive delivery fees\n(plus the stress of seeing\nif they arrive in time) and\nthe excessive boxes and\n\u201cWe feel a\ncompulsive\nneed to make\nthe best of\nthe offers that\nare constantly\nthrown at us\neven if we\ndon\u2019t actually\nneed, want or\neven like the\nproducts that\nwe buy\u201d\npackaging that come with\nit.\nEqually, if you force\nyourself to decide what\nyou will cook and when\nyou will eat, you can\nactually buy the right\nquantity of food, clear\nfreezer and fridge space\nso that you have room\nfor extras, and make use\nof the huge abundance of\ngreat leftover recipes like\nthose on BBC Good Food.\nNot only are you reducing\nyour food wastage but\nalso preventing the costly\nimpulse buys.\n2. Spend less,\ngive better\nAccording to the Centre\nfor Retail Research,\naround \u00a379 billion was\nspent in the UK between\nmid November and the\nend of December last\nyear, and particularly as\na student it\u2019s very easy to\nfeel a mounting panic at\nthe amount of money disappearing from your bank\naccount in the approach\nto Christmas. However,\nby spending and buying\nless you can not only save\nmoney but also reduce the\namount we are wasting.\nWhen it comes to presents\nless really is more. Our\nsociety makes us feel it is\nnecessary to spend time\nand money in shops in\norder to express our gratitude for each other. but is\nthere really any point in\ngiving gifts for their own\nsake and in receiving yet\nanother useless trinket?\nGifting ideas like Secret\nSanta mean you can\nafford to buy fewer, but\nmore meaningful, gifts.\nAnother great way to\nreduce waste is by gifting\nexperiences rather than\nitems, especially here in\nLondon where there\u2019s so\nmuch to do and often so\nmuch money required to\ndo it. Tickets to a concert,\na football match or the\ntheatre are after all so\nmuch more memorable\nthan a generic gift box.\n3. Upgrade your\ncards\nOur habits in less-con-sidered areas also need to\nchange when you consider\nthat, according to A Sustainable Life, an online\nguidetosustainableliving,\nan astonishing one billion\nChristmas cards end up\nin the bin. If sending\ncards is important to you\nwhy not go paperless?\nThere are a huge number\nof affordable options for\nsending e-cards: companies like Greenvelope are\nfocused on sustainability;\nOjolie allow you to send\nunlimited cards for a \u00a312\nyearly membership; Paperless Post allows photo\ncustomisation. Even\nbetter, you can donate to\ncharity at the same time.\nLarge charities including\nBarnados, Oxfam and\nMacmillan offer good\ne-card services as well.\nIt\u2019s also worth considering\nhow you dispose of any\ncards you receive. Recycling these may make you\nfeel better, but especially\nsince China\u2019s ban import\nof waste for recycling (see\nSustainability section in\nFelix 1706) they may still\nend up going to landfill or\nincineration. Instead, why\nnot reuse them as gift tags\nor make into ornaments or\nwreaths?\n4. Be creative with\nwrapping\nAccepting that there\nwill be some physical\npresents to give, how\nto give them is a whole\ndilemma in itself. In the\nUK alone 227,000 miles\nof wrapping paper is used\neach Christmas - that\u2019s\nenough to go around the\nEarth nine times!\nFollowing the old\nmantra of \u2018Reduce,\nReuse, Recycle\u2019 the best\noption yet again is to wrap\nfewer presents. Often\ngifts come already in a\nbox or festive packaging,\nso resist the temptation\nto put wrapping paper on\ntop of that. Awkwardly\nshaped gifts may actually\nlook better unwrapped\nand consider how much\ntime can save just by\ncovering them with a\nscarf or blanket. If you\ndo want to do some actual\nwrapping you could invest\nin some reusable fabric\nsuch as the reindeer print\nproduced by Happy Wrap.\nThis actually looks really\nfestive and the higher\nprice is justified by the\nfact it will last. This could\nbe a really good option\nfor giving gifts to close\nfamily as you can reclaim\nit afterwards! If you want\na more classical wrapping\nmethodyoucouldconsider\nusing newspaper or brown\npaper \u2013 both very cheap\nmaterials - and add festive\ntwine like the ones offered\nfrom eco-craft to make it\nlook prettier and biodegradable tape to make it\nrecyclable. Alternatively,\nif you\u2019re not such a pro\nat wrapping and can\u2019t\nproduce an artistic masterpiece you could opt for\nsome recycled wrapping\npaper. Rewrapped has\nsome nice Christmas\ndesigns to choose from or\nif you\u2019re happy to spend\nmore Oxfam has some\npretty handmade paper.\nAs long as you\u2019re careful\nyou can reuse these\nwrapping papers as well\n\u2013 any crumples shouldn\u2019t\nbe beyond the flattening\ncapabilities of an iron. As\na last resort checking that\nit is recyclable \u2013 paper\nwith glitter on it or that\nwon\u2019t hold its shape when\nscrunched is definitely not\nrecyclable \u2013 is better than\nnothing.\nThese ideas are just a\nstarting point to so much\nmore, but Christmas is\nthe one time where embracing even a few small\nchanges can reduce so\nmuch waste. Lets resist\nthe temptation to forget\nabout the environment\nover the festive period,\nand as we give presents to\nour friends and family, try\nto give this present to our\nplanet too.\nProof that wrapping with brown paper doesn\u2019t mean\nyour presents will look plain years to come // Deavita\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 7TH DECEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nesoc@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

A\nbroader and wider understanding of different types\nof risk faced in investment\nmanagement and financial\nservices is critical towards\nour understanding of\ndifferent investment and\nfinancial products, services and strategies adopted\nin a growing risk-dynamic\nenvironment that we are\nexperiencing today. The\ndifferent types of risk\ninclude: credit risk, operational risk, market risk,\ninvestment risk, liquidity\nrisk and model risk. The\naim of this article is to\nfocus on credit risk in\ninvestment management\nand financial services.\nCredit risk is the\nprobable risk of loss\nresulting from a\nborrower\u2019s failure to\nrepay a loan or meet\ncontractual obligations.\nIt is the risk of default on\na debt that arises when a\nreporting plays a vital role\nin credit risk management.\nThree commonly used\ntechniques for assessing\ncredit risk are: credit\nexposure; credit risk\npremium and credit\nrating. Credit exposure\nmeasures the total amount\nof credit extended to a\nborrower by a lender.\nThe higher the credit\nexposure of an investment\nfirm or financial firm, the\nhigher the likelihood of\ncredit default. Credit risk\npremium is the return in\nexcess of the risk-free rate\nof return on a credit-based\ninvestment is expected to\nyield. Credit risk premium\nrewards an investor who\ntolerates extra risk. High\nrisk credit-based asset\nattracts a higher credit risk\npremium. Credit rating is\na credit score that reflects\nthe likelihood of payment\nby a borrower. The higher\nthe credit rating, the\nhigher the likelihood of\npayment. The big three\ncredit rating agencies are:\nMoody\u2019s, Standard &\nPoor and Fitch rating.\nAn effective credit risk\npolicy is paramount and\nessential for modelling,\ncontrolling and managing\ncredit risk. The key\nstages of credit risk\npolicy development\nrecommended by Basel\nare: development,\nvalidation, approval,\nimplementation, review\nand post-implementation\nmonitoring. Credit risk\nand credit risk policy\ncan be effectively\nmanaged by using: a\nreliable credit scoring\nsystem; understanding\nfinancial, non-financial\nand extraordinary\ninput factor to a firm;\nconducting robust stress\ntesting, setting limits\nor caps to control risk;\nmonitoring and tracking\nkey risk statistics and\nkey risk indicators and\ncontinuously carrying\nout internal and external\ncredit audit. It is important\nto note that effective credit\nrisk mitigation is also\nrequired. This involves\nhaving underwriting\nstandards, guarantees,\ncredit limits, netting,\ncollateral, diversification,\ncredit derivatives, credit\ndefault swaps, insurance\nand central counterparties.\nThe 2008 financial\ncrisis remains a prime\nexample and a prime\nreminder of credit risk\nfailure. There was a\nhigh default rate in the\nUnited States subprime\nhome mortgages sector\n( m o r t g a g e - b a c k e d\nsecurities). On one hand,\nthis was partly caused\nby deregulation in the\nfinancial industry which\nled banks to execute very\nrisky derivates trades. On\nthe other hand, the credit\n\u201cCredit rating\nis a credit\nscore that\nreflects the\nlikelihood of\npayment by\na borrower.\nThe higher the\ncredit rating,\nthe higher the\nlikelihood of\npayment\u201d\nborrower fails to make\nrequired payment. This\nimplies a lender does not\nreceive the owed principal\nand interest. This leads to\na negative disruption in\nthe lender\u2019s cash flows\nand increases costs of debt\ncollection.\nThree key components\nof credit risk are:\ncounterparty risk, issuer\nrisk and concentration\nrisk. Counterparty risk\nis the risk associated\nwith the risk that each\nparty of a contract will\nnot meet its contractual\nobligations. Issuer risk is\nthe risk associated with\nthe probability of loss\nresulting from the default\nof the issuer of the credit.\nConcentration risk is\nthe risk arising from the\nconcentration to a single\ncounterparty, sector,\ncountry and/or industry.\nThe key issues associated\nwith credit risk includes:\nprobability of default, loss\ngiven default, exposure\nat default, recovery rates,\ncredit events, maturity,\nwrong way risk and non-performing credit asset.\nCredit risk\nmeasurement and\nLehman Brothers had to file for bankruptcy during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis// Linda Nylind/Guardian\nRiskinInvestmentManagementandFinancialServices\nPart 1 :Credit Risk\n\u201cThe higher\nthe credit\nexposure of\nan investment\nfirm or\nfinancial firm,\nthe higher the\nlikelihood of\ncredit default\u201d\nfailure was due to an\nextremely large appetite\nfor banks to increase their\nprofit margin at all cost.\nThe result of the credit risk\nfailure can be highlighted\nas follows:\n1. Worst recession\nsince the Great Depression\n2. House prices in\nthe US fell by 31.8%\n3. 8.8 million jobs\nlost in the US\n4. $19.2 trillion lost\nhousehold wealth\n5. Lehman Brothers\nfiled for bankruptcy\n6. Global financial\nsystems came to its knees\nThe role and sound\npractices of credit risk\nmanagement and credit\nrisk policy development\nin practice is complex and\nchallenging. However,\ncontinuous and iterative\ncredit risk management\nand credit risk policy\ndevelopment remains\ncentral and critical to\nthe success of firms in\ninvestment management\nand financial services in\nan ever growing dynamic\nenvironment.\n\n"

The richly\ndystopian world created\nin this film is a perfect\ncanvas to paint the story\nwith Lubezki\u2019s cinematic\nbrush, often with visceral\n\u2018one-shot\u2019 take set pieces\nthat are the precursors\nto Lubezki\u2019s work in\nBirdman.\nBut is it a Christmas\nfilm?

The title lady is Elizebeth Smith, half of one of the greatest\ncodebreaking duos in history. With her husband William Friedman, she pioneered the field of modern cryptology during the height of\nWorld War I. An expert on Shakespeare, Smith was asked by her employer, who had ties with the government, to apply her language\nskills to code-breaking. There, she met her husband, and they became some of the most important people of the US National Security\nAgency. Despite that, their story has never been fully told, until this new biography by Jason Fagone. During World War II, Smith worked on the\nEnigma machine used by the Germans, cracking multiple versions. At the same time, her husband worked on the Japanese verison of Enigma,\nPurple. This is the story of America\u2019s cryptography history told through the prism of Smith\u2019s life, and how it shaped modern intelligence. A\nfascinating and inspiring read. - Jingjie Cheng\nJoy to your bookshelf\n\u2018Tis the season for giving, and Felix Books is here to help with four of our recommendations to spread literary\ncheer!\nW\ninner of the British BookAwards, this stunning debut novel by Gail Honeyman delves deep into lone-liness, connections and the power of kindness. The theme of isolation is one that is rarely explored in\ncontemporary culture; as Honeyman puts it, \u201cThese days, loneliness is the new cancer \u2013 a shameful,\nembarrassing thing, brought upon yourself in some obscure way.\u201d The premise of a solitary heroine\nis interesting, but Honeyman takes it to the next level, crafting a beautiful character and inviting the readers to\nknow Eleanor intimately through her narrative. I smiled at Eleanor\u2019s hilarious comments as she navigates through\ncommon aspects of human life; I shed tears when she is overwhelmed by love and care. I especially want to\napplaud Honeyman for her portrayal of mental illness, breaking stereotypes and presenting a perfectly layered\nand flawed character who is a product of her environment. Simply put, this novel has it all \u2013 humour skilfully\nintertwined with heavier material, an emotional roller-coaster and a charming protagonist. A heart-wrenching yet\nsoul-soothing read, it\u2019s the perfect gift for those whom you love and treasure. - Jia Qi Tan\nEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman\nBOOKS\nJingjie Cheng\nBooks Editor\nJia Qi Tan\nBooks Writer\nThe Woman who Smashed Codes by Jason Fagone\nK\nnow someone who loves their tea? A Little Tea Book is an ode to tea, the art of tea-making, and the joys of tea-drinking. Sebastian\nBeckwith fell in love with tea while working as a guide in Bhutan in the 1980s, and over the years has sought out the finest, most\nsustainably-grown and ethically harvested teas and brought them to the menus of some of New York\u2019s finest restaurants. He distills\nhis tea wisdom into this very book. It is everything you ever wanted to know about tea \u2013 part field guide to choosing, preparing and\nenjoying tea, part love letter. He touches on the history of tea, as well as exploring some of the common myths of tea. It is beautifully illustrated\nby Wendy MacNaughton, full of lively, colourful drawings. The book is a lovely work of art that one would keep on the bookshelf for time to\ncome, to be leafed through regularly for a dose of tea-happiness. - Jingjie Cheng\nA Little Tea Book: All the Essentials from Leaf to Cup by Sebastian\nBeckwith and Caroline Paul\nSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat by Samin Nosrat\nT\nhere are shelves upon shelves of cookbooks in every bookshop, each surrounding a certain theme or cuisine. This book is different. A\nformer chef at Chez Panisse, Samin Nosrat distills all cooking into four elements \u2013 salt, fat, acid and heat. With an understanding of\nthese four elements, one can cook anything from first principles, she believes. Perfect for the aspiring chef in your life, this book starts\nfrom the basics, and is written in an approachable way. It is also charmingly illustrated by Wendy MacNaughton (again!). Nosrat has\nbeen praised as a teacher, and this is evident in the way she instructs in this book. Her theories are easy to grasp and applicable to a wide variety\nof dishes. Now, the book has been adapted into a Netflix series of the same name. It is by no means introducing revolutionary new ideas into\ncooking, but it certainly distills food science into its essentials. - Jingjie Cheng\n\n"

    "content": "It's a Sabb, Sabb Situation\nNEWS\nWith their first term in\noffice nearing its end,\nFelix sat down with\nthe Union sabbatical\nofficers to discuss their\nprogress so far\nAndy Djaba\nEditor-in-Chief\nFelix: For the people\nthat don't know, can\neach of you explain\nwhat your role is\nJames: I\u2019m DPCS.\nMy role is two-fold in\nlooking after our 370-odd\nclubs and societies, their\ncreation, their day-to-day\nrunning and, when things\ngo wrong, basically\nhelping them out of a\npickle and supporting\nthem through that. It\u2019s\nalso to do with the representation side, which we\nall work on. When a club,\nsociety or general student\nhas an issue that they\nwant to make better - be\nit about spaces, be it about\nthe activities theyre doing,\nbe it about how College is\nsupporting them - taking\nthat to College, working\nwith them and trying to\nmake that change.\nBecky: I\u2019m DPW. I\nwork with College quite\na lot to look at some of\nthe student services and\nlook at how they can be\nimproved and how they\nwork for students and\nlook at different policies\nand things that are in\nplace around welfare. I\nalso work with two teams\nof students: the wellbeing\nreps, which are really important because College\nis actually talking about\nwellbeing now rather than\nbeing a bit afraid of it.\nStudents are talking about\nwellbeing, which is really\nexciting. Then I also work\nwith the Liberation and\nCommunity officers, who\nwe\u2019re trying to build a\nbigger platform for.\nDan: Hi I\u2019m Dan,\nI\u2019m the President of the\nSchool of Medicine\u2019s\nStudents\u2019 Union. I look\nafter the Students\u2019 Union\nalong with 19 other\nvolunteer officers. Our\nmain role is to ensure that\nall of medical school life\nruns smoothly in ICSM\nand then also ensuring\nthat the unique interests\nof medical students and\nBSC Medical Biosciences\nstudents are represented\nand taken into account at\nall levels of the College,\nUnion and the faculty.\nClaudia: Hi I\u2019m\nClaudia, I\u2019m DPFS. My\nrole comes in two parts:\nthe finance part is looking\nat the general overall\nUnion finances, contributing to annual budgeting\nas well as looking at our\ninvestment strategies and\nwhere our money goes. I\nalso look at club finances,\nso helping advise on event\nbudgets, financial planning and helping them\nout with any day-to-day\ntransactions. The other\nhalf is the services side;\nlooking at commercial\nservices within the Union,\nwhat else we provide in\nterms of health and safety\nin the Union and then also\nworking with College,\nlooking at the kind of\nspecial projects they\u2019ve\ngot going around 24\nhour vending, looking at\ncatering, looking at how\nsustainable the College is.\nRob: I\u2019m Rob, I\u2019m the\nUnion President. I probably touch on a little bit of\neverything in the way that,\nin the Union, I support all\nmy Deputy Presidents and\nthen also I take control of\nthings such as governance\nand democracy. In terms\nof what I tackle at College,\nmy main role is probably\nensuring that the student\nvoice is heard at all levels.\nSo all the meetings all the\nway up to top of College\nCouncil to individual one-on-ones in areas that we\nreally want to prioritise\n- working on things like\nwidening participation,\nwellbeing, educational\nreform and so on.\nAlejandro: I\u2019m Alejandro, I\u2019m this year\u2019s\nDPE. My role is similar\nto the other OTs in that\nit has two parts. The first\nis to lead and manage the\nAcademic Representation Network. That\u2019s a\nnetwork of over 500 volunteers and that consists\nof everything from the\nelection process, through\ntraining and support,\nright up to making sure\nthat they\u2019re embedded\nin decision making at\nall levels; that includes\ndepartments, faculties and\nCollege-wide. The other\nside of my role is representing all students at the\nhigher levels - influencing\nCollege policy to improve\nit and keep students at\nthe centre and essentially\nhelping College to shape\nsome of their projects.\nHow have you found it\nso far?\nBecky: It\u2019s been really\ngood. It\u2019s been surprising\nthat College actually\nlistens to us. Basically,\nI didn\u2019t expect College\nto listen to us at all but\nCollege can\u2019t listen to\n19,500 people at the same\ntime, they have to listen\nto one voice. They can\u2019t\nreply to every single\nstudent\u2019s e-mail so it\u2019s\nactually really important\nto talk to us and then what\nwe say is really important\nbecause College does\nmake big decisions based\non what we say.\nClaudia: I\u2019d agree with\nBecky, I think the most\nsurprising thing for me\nhas been working with\nCollege, how much they\nlisten to you.\nDo the rest of you\nthink similarly, you've\nbeen surprised with\nhow much interaction\nyou've had with\nCollege?\nAlejandro: Not just the\nlevel of interaction but\nthe level of partnership\nthat exists that I didn\u2019t\nthink existed when I first\nwent into the role. So,\nlike Becky, I didn\u2019t think\nthey\u2019d listen as much as\nthey do and it\u2019s hard to\nquantify that but the way\nthat I would describe it\nis, when any of us are\nsitting around a table with\na bunch of College staff,\nwe\u2019re an equal at that\ntable and our voice is just\nas relevant and important.\nOver the course of\nthe year, how much\nchange do you think\nyou can actually\neffect?\nClaudia: I think we\nall had our manifestos\ncoming in but, although\nthey\u2019re things we want to\nachieve and, if we solely\nfocus on that, we could\nachieve most of them,\ncoming into the role, I\u2019ve\nnoticed certain issues and\nbigger priorities so some\npoints on my manifesto\nhave been put on the side\nto address bigger issues. I\nthink it\u2019s important to do\nthings that are relevant to\nour current students. My\npriorities have changed\nthroughout the year, addressing other things.\nRob: There\u2019s the\nprojects that are handed\nover from a previous year,\nwhich can be of varying\nscale. It could be just a\nlittle thing that needs a\ntick-off. To be honest, the\nmain project that I have\nto do at the moment is a\ndisciplinary review, which\nwas delightfully handed\nover by Chippy. That now\ntakes up a lot of my time.\nI do think that, actually,\nwe\u2019d be surprised with\nhow much we can tick off\nour manifestos. The first\nmonth, you\u2019re figuring out\nwhat the hell are we doing\nYour Officer Trustees // Imperial College Union\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nDECEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n4 5\nISSUE 1708\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDan Faehndrich, ICSMU\nPresident // Imperial College\nUnion\nand the second month, all\nof a sudden, you get that\nwave of all the easy wins\nthat you can have, with\nthe little changes happening one after the other.\nAfter that, things slowed\ndown, but the second\nmonth for me was a really\nproductive one. There are\nthings that seem like they\nwill be a big fight and,\nfor whatever reason, you\nmeet the right person in\nCollege and it works or it\ncould be that there\u2019s just\nloops and loops and loops.\nMy biggest frustration so\nfar has been the excuse,\n\u201cwe\u2019re doing it because\nwe\u2019ve always done it\nthis way\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a step\nforward\u201d, when actually\nwe\u2019re like, \u201cwell if you\u2019re\nmaking a step forward,\nlet\u2019s make the right step\nforward\u201d. So, in that way,\nit\u2019s been frustrating and\nthat\u2019s been both in the\nUnion and in College.\nProbably, just because\nof my role, it\u2019s mainly in\nCollege. It\u2019s one of my\nlargest frustrations of\nbeing there.\nGive me a description\nof what a typical day\nor week looks like.\nAlejandro: I go to a lot\nof meetings. We all go to\na lot of meetings but, Rob\nand I in particular, go to a\nlot of meetings. The idea\nbehind that is to get the\nstudent voice and opinion\nembedded into all levels\nof decision making. I go\nto certain meetings to try\nand help departments to\ndevelop action plans and\nthen also to keep them\naccountable to those\naction plans. The whole\nidea behind that is just to\nimprove the local student\nexperience in every de-partment. The academic\nreps are heavily involved\nin that as well, they\u2019re\nworking with departmental staff to develop those\naction plans, together with\nall the work that\u2019s happening with the curriculum\nreview to just improve\nthe overall situation. But\na typical week, I\u2019ll be\nworking on some of that,\nI\u2019ll be doing some Union\nprojects, we might have\nsomething like Union\nCouncil or Board of Trustees or a sub-committee\nwhich requires some\nadditional preparation. In\none day I can train reps\nand work with reps, so\nthat\u2019s a very local level of\nworking, and then, later\non in the day I\u2019ll have a\nmeeting with the OTs to\ndiscuss a Union project.\nSo it\u2019s all different levels\nthat I can work on and any\nday could look like that or\nit could be different.\nRob: Things rotate\nround because of how\nmany College meetings all\nrotate on a monthly basis.\nProbably about a third to\nhalf of my time is spent in\nthose meetings, which can\nrange from anything from\na half an hour quick chat\nwith someone to 3-6 hour\nstints in certain committees on all sorts of topics.\nThe project work fits in\naround that. Also, because\nof Union Board and Union\nCouncil, quite a lot of the\nmandated things tend to\nend up coming toward my\ndirection so I have to fit\nthat into my timetabling\nas well. It\u2019s tough because\nit\u2019s so variable.\nClaudia: I would say\nI probably have a more\naverage month than an\naverage week. I think\none of the most important\nthings to highlight is that\nthe OTs meet up once a\nweek for at least two hours\nand we catch eachother up\non all the different pro-jects. We get eachother\u2019s\nviews on things and then\nwe also discuss any papers\ncoming up to any of the\nmeetings happening that\nweek so we have a kind of\ncollaborative view. We\u2019ve\nthought of the student perspectives from all different thoughts and gathered\nour group\u2019s knowledge.\nThe rest of the week, it\nvaries between doing\ne-mails and meeting with\na lot of clubs and societies\nto talk over event budgets,\nlooking at POs, dealing\nwith financial issues. You\nwon\u2019t always find me at\nmy desk because, like\nthe other sabbs, we have\nmeetings we\u2019re going in\nand out of.\nDan: None of my\ndays are regular 9-5. I\u2019ll\neither have early stuff so\nI attempt to finish early.\nA lot of it going between\ncampuses, meeting with\nfaculty students. Just\nensuring all of the volunteer officers under me\naren\u2019t overburdened. I can\nfacilitate them with any\nprojects they want to work\non. If there\u2019s anything that\nthey need help with then\nensuring that I can help\nwith that. A lot of it is\nquite student-facing but\nit completely varies day\non day. Some days I have\nabsolutely nothing, I can\nsit down, smash through\nsome emails, do general\nadmin, but then some days\nare lots of meetings with\ndifferent stakeholders. It\u2019s\nnice to keep it quite varied\nto be honest, doesn\u2019t get\nmonotonous at all.\nBecky: I probably get\ntwo or three students\ncoming to me with their\nindividual welfare related\nproblems. They can be\nreally serious ones, really\nlittle ones. Sometimes\npeople come to me when\ntheir friend has an issue\nand they want to know\nwhat to do. Then I tend to\nbe in touch with the wellbeing reps at some point.\nNormally one of them or\nsome of them have some\nsort of questions or something they want to know\nand so, between me and\nsomeone in the Education\n& Welfare team, that question is normally answered.\nThere will normally be\nsomething the Liberation\n& Community officers\nwant to do so there will\nbe something around that.\nMaybe it\u2019s an event that\nI\u2019ll help them do or an\nevent that I go to to go and\nsee what\u2019s going on. Then\nthere\u2019s Union projects that\nare happening.\nJames: My days are\nsplit a bit reactively and a\nbit proactively. It\u2019s quite\nnice, I get the consistency\nof working on projects\nmuch similar to a uni\nproject - plan it, execute\nit, evaluate it at the end.\nBut also the chaos of students getting up to things,\nwhich is great fun. It\u2019s\nalso quite worth saying, a\nnormal week for all of us\nas a team is quite an odd\nconcept.\nHow have you found\nworking together as a\nteam?\nBecky: We\u2019re all\nquite different, we all\nhave our strengths and\nour weaknesses but they\nseem to work quite well\ntogether. We all have very\ngood knowledge bases of\ndifferent areas that also\ngel quite well together.\nWe haven\u2019t had any major\nfallouts yet, which is\npretty impressive.\nClaudia: We\u2019re quite\nwilling to challenge\neachother. I\u2019ve noticed\nBecky challenges a lot\non accessibility so I\u2019ve\nactually become better at\nchallenging now College\nwhen they mention some-thing. Trying to think of\nall the OT\u2019s perspectives,\n\u201chave you thought about\nthis in terms of policy?\nHave you thought of this\nin terms of accessibility?\nHave you thought about\nhow it\u2019s going to affect all\nthe clubs and societies that\nuse this?\u201d Its quite nice. I\nthink we push eachother\nquite well.\nDo you have any\nspecific plans\nfor getting more\ninvolvmenet and\nengagement across\nthe student body with\nthe Union?\nBecky: One of our\nteam goals is commu-nication. It\u2019s definitely\nsomething that\u2019s on our\nradar and something that\nwe\u2019re trying to work on\nto improve. We\u2019re trying\ndifferent methods of communication to see what\nthe students are interested\nin. We\u2019re trying to engage\npeople that we\u2019ve previously not been as good\nat engaging - post-grads,\npeople on different cam-puses.\nClaudia: I think communication is two things.\nWe have team and Union\ngoals of how to do it but\nalso it can be quite personal for communicating\nwhat we do as an OT or\na sabb. We\u2019re each trying\nour own different styles\nin some ways because I\nwould say the best way\nto connect with someone\nis actually feeling like\nthey\u2019re not a robot just\ntelling you stuff. You\nactually feel a bit more\nof a personal connection,\nso your methods of communication change there.\nI\u2019ve tried it with writing\nFelix articles and blog-ging. We\u2019re open to ideas.\nAlejandro: We have a\nfeeling of what we could\ndo better and we\u2019re all\nworking on that individ-ually. I think the postgrad\none is an example of\nwhere it\u2019s a systematic\nproblem that we have to\nnot just tackle in throwing more messages at\nthem but actually asking\nyourselves \u201cwhy don\u2019t we\nget postgrads engaged?\u201d\nThey\u2019re not very well represented at council, that\u2019s\na contributing factor.\nSum up the first term\nof being a sabb. What\nhave your prioritised\nthis term?\nDan: It\u2019s been a really\nsteep learning curve but a\nreally fulfilling experience\nbeing able to work with a\nbunch of really passionate\nindividuals from a lot of\ndifferent backgrounds\ntrying to achieve mostly a\ncommon cause. Trying to\nempower my volunteers\nto get done what they\nwant. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve\ndone it correctly all of\nthe time but I\u2019ve tried my\nbest. Also trying to ensure\nthat the new curriculum\nthat\u2019s coming in next year\nand one of the national\nexams that\u2019s coming in is\nconsulted with students as\nmuch as possible.\nJames: Let\u2019s start with\na clich\u00e9.

    "content": "The cost of wasting meat\nC\nonsuming meat\nis bad for the\nenvironment.\nMeat production\nproduces huge amounts\nof greenhouse gases,\nconsumes millions of\nliters of water and takes\nup monstrous quantities\nof land. Yep, we\u2019ve heard\nit over and over again.\nHowever, have you ever\nconsidered the impact of\nactually throwing away\nthe meat that is not eaten?\nFood waste represents\na huge problem, with\n7.3 million tons of food\nwasted by UK households\nevery year. In fact, a third\nof food purchased in the\nUK is thrown away. Of\nthat amount, households\nare wasting around\n570,000 tons of fresh meat\neach year which is equivalent to about 50 million\nchickens, 1.5 million pigs\nor 100,000 beef cattle.\nGlobally it\u2019s close to 12\nbillion animals, a huge\namount of living creatures\nborn to be killed and\nwasted.\nProducing, processing\nfood in the UK are no\nlonger grazed on grass\nor, in the case of pigs and\npoultry, fed food waste.\nInstead, over recent\ndecades a highly industrial\nsystem has emerged, with\nanimals being housed in\nlarge numbers and fed on\nfeed shipped in from all\nover the globe. This feed\ntakes huge amounts of\nland to grow, it consists of\na third of all crops grown\nglobally, and in countries such as Brazil and\nParaguay, forests are cut\ndown and rural communities thrown off the land to\nmake way for them.\nOne quarter of global\nfreshwater use relates to\nproducing meat and dairy,\nwhich is likely to increase\nif production continues to\nrise. Livestock is responsible for nearly 15% of\nall global greenhouse gas\nemissions contributing\nto global climate change.\nBeef, in particular,\nproduces 25kg of CO2 per\nkg of meat.\nFrom this, it is clear\nthat wasting food and\nespecially meat uses up\nvaluable resources and is\nterribly damaging for the\nenvironment.\nSo, what can we do to\nhelp? Some argue that\nveganism is the only way\nforward. A study last year\nshowed that if all Americans substituted beans for\nbeef, the country would\nachieve over half of the\nreduction in greenhouse\ngas emission agreed by\nthe United States in 2008.\nThis would also free up\n42% of the country\u2019s crop\nland. Nevertheless, not\neating any meat is not the\nonly answer. If you don\u2019t\nwant to completely give it\nup, a simple contribution\nwould be to waste less of\nthe meat you buy. That\nin itself will help prevent\nresources being used for\nnothing.\nThere are simple steps\nyou can take to make a\ndifference:\n\u2022 Find out about different\ndate labels. Did you know\nyou can freeze food right\nup to 24 hours before the\nuse by date?\n\u2022 Eat less but better\nquality meat, and avoid\nbeef, so that there\u2019s less\nmeat to waste and what\nyou do use will be kinder\nto the planet.\n\u2022 Plan meals, get your\nportions right and make\nthe most of the food you\nbuy.\n\u2022 Store your food\ncorrectly to keep it fresh\nfor longer.\n\u2022 Make last night\u2019s\nleftovers today\u2019s feast.\n\u2022 Try making one day\na week vegan or vege-tarian, and try limiting\nthe amount of red meat\nyou consume to just one\nportion a week, the planet\nwill thank you!\nO\nver 1,000 protesters from\nthe environmental campaign group Extinction\nRebellion came together\nin Central London on\nthe Saturday 28th November to demand environmental justice and\ndemand legislative action to confront climate\nbreakdown and the global biodiversity crisis.\nThe Extinction Rebellion campaign has mobilised thousands of activists\nacross the UK to participate in acts of mass civil\ndisobedience, causing\nmajor disruptions across\nLondon.

This year at Felix we decided that rather than a conventional top-ten, we\u2019d take a bunch\nof submissions from you, the people. And so here are, in no particular order, Imperial\u2019s albums of the year 2018.\nMUSIC\nFelix Music\nMusic Writers\nEverything Is Love\nThe Carters\nIt\u2019s a piece of a JeanMichel state of mind, with\nMona Lisa right behind.\nEmbedded in a celebration of black love we are\ngiven the final piece to a\nlove story that started with\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade and\nJAY-Z\u2019s 4:44. Assembling\nsuccinctly as The Carters\nwe see the world\u2019s biggest\npower couple revel in\ntheir extravagance as\nthey detail a memoir\nof their marriage. This\nmasterpiece truly lives as\na musical manifestation of\ntheir cultural sovereignty.\n- Alex Mitcham\nHigh As Hope\nFlorence and the Machine\nWhat is Florence and\nthe Machine if not grand?\nThe theatre of their albums\nis something listeners\nhave come to love and\nexpect. In that sense, this\nalbum serves as another\nstep along a well-estab-lished path of the band\u2019s\npassionate and elegant\nmethod. Having said that,\nit would be a great shame\nto overlook the quieter,\nless familiar beauty this\nalbum radiates. Florence\u2019s\nlyrics and vocals have\nalways guided the band\u2019s\ninstrumentation. The\nespecially daring, layered\nyet assured soundscapes\npresented here therefore\nmake perfect sense.Where\nFlorence\u2019s openness has\npreviously been an act of\nwearing her heart on her\nsleeve, this time, though\nequally thorough, immer-sive and lush, she gives\nus more by giving us less.\nThat is to say, as well as\nher soul, she lets us hear\nher conscious dialogue\nwith her soul, unaltered\nand unfiltered. Don\u2019t\nmistake this for subtle or\nnew: High As Hope is a\nsentimental optimist who\nyou love, breaking down\nand proving to you that,\nbeneath a thin but taut\nlayer, they have always\nbeen just as self-aware,\nintrospective and nuanced\nas you suspected. Being\nboldly timid without apol-ogising for an innate hope\nand doing it flawlessly is\nwhat makes this album.\n- Asad Raja\nI\u2019m All Ears\nLet\u2019s Eat Grandma\nThe second studio\nalbum from Let\u2019s eat\nGrandma, a duo of precocious teenage girls from\nNorwich, runs the whole\ngamut of electro pop/\nrock. From the SOPHIE\nproduced mechanised\nchaos of lead single \u2018Hot\nPink\u2019, which gleefully\nplays both with concepts\nof femininity and chain-sawesque synths, to\nthe epic eleven minute\ncloser \u2018Donnie Darko\u2019,\nthis album is a kaleidoscopic gem. Indeed, the\nwondrously coruscating\nproduction throughout,\ncoupled with the piercingly emotive lyrics makes\nthis easily my favourite\nrelease of the year.\n- Josh D\u2019aeth\nIridescence\nBrockhampton\nAfter a turbulent year\nforthe\u201cbestboybandsince\none direction\u201d, including\nthe loss of a key member\nand a multi-million dollar\nrecord deal, Brockhampton finally delivered\nIridescence. Packed with\nindustrial-tinged bangers\nand shapeshifting, introspective gems, this album\npacks a serious punch.\nProduction veers from\nvisceral to glistening\ninstantaneously, often\nboth at once. By far the\nstrangest album to top\nbillboard this year.\n- Miles Gulliford\nHoney\nRobyn\nIn the eight years\nsince Robyn released her\nseminal album Body Talk,\nher music has become\nsomething of a template\nfor an entire generation\nof pop-writers. With their\nfour-to-the-floor beats,\ncatchy hooks, and emo-tionally-insightful lyrics,\nsingles like \u2018Dancing\non my Own\u2019 helped\nbirth a new era of music\nappropriate for both the\nclub and crying in your\nbedroom.\nThe expectation\nfor follow-up Honey,\ntherefore, was sky high.\nBut Robyn delivered.\nShe did so not, as many\npresumed, by continuing\nwith the icy synth-pop of\nBody Talk, but instead by\nintroducing a new warmth\ninto her sound, while\npaying tribute to the club\nculture in which she has\nimmersed herself.\nComing off the death\nof a close friend and the\nbreakup of a long-term\nrelationship, Honey acts\nas an aural balm, soothing\nour wounds while retaining a melancholy depth.\nWhile there is a clear\nlink to her previous work,\nHoney marks Robyn out\nas a modern pop icono-clast, breaking out of a\nblueprint she created.\n- Fred Fyles\nTwin Fantasy\nCar Seat Headrest\nWhile it may be a\nremake of the 2011 lo-fi\noriginal, the explosive\nreworking of this coming\nof age story make it\nenough of a new album\nto be included on this list.\nAngsty yet assertive, the\nalbum\u2019s narrator details\nhis hopeless longing for\na nameless man who\nhe recognises he can\u2019t\nbe with. It\u2019s a tale of\nwhat-could-have-been-but-never-quite-was, told\nthrough both wit and\nsorrow. It\u2019s musically\ndense, spanning classic\nindie rock instrumentals\nand screamed choruses,\nthrough to phase-shifted\nspoken word sound-scapes, all drenched in\nWill Toledo\u2019s signature\nanecdotal charm.\n- Adrian LaMoury\nBottom:\nEverything\nIs\nLove;\nHigh\nAs\nHope;\nI\u2019m\nAll\nEars.\nMiddle:\nIridescence;\nHoney.\nTop:\nTwin\nFantasy;\nTime\n\u2018n\u2019\nPlace\n//\nSony;\nVirgin;\nTransgressive;\nRCA;\nInterscope;\nMatador;\nPolyvinyl\nISSUE 1708\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\na door and bawl your eyes\nout in consecutive tracks.\nA humorous, well-crafted\nrelease, Joy as an Act of\nResistance is the perfect\nantidote to the depressing\npolitical landscape of\n2018.\n- Joe O\u2019connell-Danes\nOdyssey\nTake That\nAlmost 30 years-worth\nof banging tunes and\nmany, many memories;\nfive working class men\nwith the ambition and determination to work super\nhard for success; great\nmotivation in the morning\nto face the day and escape\non the way home. Though\nI do have restrain myself\nfrom performing the well-known dance moves on\nthe Piccadilly line home!\n- Catrin Davies\nWhite Is Relic/\nIrrealis Mood\nOf Montreal\nOf Montreal\u2019s fifteenth\nstudio album White Is\nRelic/Irrealis Mood is\na paranoid electronic\nspin on the band\u2019s usual\nwork. It brings the focus\non social commentary\nwe have come to expect\nfrom the band\u2019s lead\nKevin Barnes, who sings\nin disbelief about the state\nof the world, citing social\ncritics James Baldwin\nand Noam Chomsky as\ninfluences.\nBarnes, in shock at the\nstate of late capitalism\nand in anger at \u201ctoxic\nAmerican White identity\u201d,\nsuggests reality really\nexists inside a simulation:\nin \u2018Plateau Phase/No Careerism No Corruption\u2019he\nsings \u201cIf we put our ear to\nthe ceiling / we can hear\nthe government breathing\n/ [\u2026] we can hear the\nsimulation wheezing.\u201d\nHis sharp anxiety soaks\nthe complex lyrics in a\npulsing drumbeat and\nelaborate instrumentals.\nThis is perhaps one of the\nleast accessible albums\nfrom the group, but its\nmore electronic focus\nrepresents a new direction\nfor them, and one I look\nforward to hearing more\nof.\n- Josef Willsher\nBark Your Head\nOff, Dog\nHop Along\nThis album is 40\nminutes of indie rock\nbliss. Every single song\nis gorgeous, catchy, and\nbeautifully written. There\nare more incredible hooks\nthan I know what to do\nwith; some songs even\nhave more than one. It\nsounds wistful, big-heart-ed and romantic, with\nvocals and lyrics that are\nso heartfelt you can\u2019t help\nbut be captivated.\n\u00ad- Alex Large\nNow Only\nMount Eerie\nPhil Elverum aka\nMount Eerie follows up\non last year\u2019s tragic A\nCrow Looked At Me, with\na slightly sweeter, more\nfree-form collection of\nsongs, he leads us through\nthe twists and turns of\nhis life in the wake of his\nwife\u2019s tragic death. While\nthe instrumentals and\nvocals are fragile at times,\nPhil shows us again that\ndwelling on mortality and\nthe fragility of life is what\nhe does best.\n- Miles Gulliford\nLittle Dark Age\nMGMT\nMGMT\u2019s Little Dark\nAge is their strongest\nrelease to date. That said,\nwhile it is a good, possibly\neven great, album, I was\nhesitant about whether it\nwas album-of-the-year-worthy. But looking back\non 2018, it is the best\nalbum that my unashamedly ignorant ears came\nacross this year. The title\ntrack is an undeniable\nbanger with its goth-synth-pop sound, and the\nmusical and lyrical quirks\nthroughout the record\nmake for an engaging and\namusing listen, especially\non tracks \u2018She Works\nOut Too Much\u2019, \u2019When\nYou Die\u2019 and \u2018TSLAMP\u2019\n(Time Spent Looking At\nMy Phone). One can\u2019t\nhelp but feel that MGMT\nhave gleefully adopted a\npost-ironic stance on this\nalbum, and in my book\nthat beats chart-oriented\npop any day. LDA might\nnot objectively be 2018\u2019s\nbest album, but as of now\nfor me it is.\n- Neel Le Penru\nE.MO.TION\nCarly Rae Jepsen\nthem reach new heights as\nthey continue to construct\naddictive melodies with\nclever, emotive lyrics. The\nalbum asks the question: is\nlove dead? And explores\nthemes surrounding it.\nIn \u2018Graves\u2019, lead singer\nLauren Mayberry, croons:\n\u201cLeaving bodies in stairwells and washing up on\nshores\u201d. This is a clear\nallusion to the tragedies\nthat occurred in Grenfell\nas well as the current\nrefugee crisis. Other\nsongs explore the theme\nin terms of relationships\nand friendships, but each\none can be enjoyed for its\nmelody and its meaning.\n- Eamon Akil Farhat\nJoy As An Act Of\nResistance\nIDLES\nFollowing on from\ntheir eccentric first album,\nIdles dropped a punchy\npost-punk project for\nBrexit Britain. Politically\ncharged from start to\nfinish, Joy as an Act\nof Resistance tackles\neverything from male\nsuicide rates to immigra-tion, all with smirking\nlyrical flair. With production to back-up the sharp\nlyricism, the album can\nmake you want to kick in\nTime \u2018n\u2019 Place\nKero Kero Bonito\nOn their debut LP\nBonito Generation,\nKKB showcased their\ninfectious brand of dance-pop filled with ebullient\nmelodies and childlike\nlyricism. Despite this\nleading to quite the cult\nfollowing, with Time\n\u2018n\u2019 Place they shed the\ncomputer-based beats\nand Japanese rapping in\nfavour of noisy guitars\nand poignant lyrical\nsubjects. What results is\na fleshed-out, dreamy,\nnostalgic indie rock masterpiece which maintains\nthe youthful optimism of\ntheir roots.\n- Eren Akademir\nLove Is Dead\nCHVRCHES\nCHVRCHES\u2019 third\nalbum Love Is Dead sees\nWell, she\u2019s done it\nagain folks. It may be hard\nto believe, but Ms. Carly\nRae Jepsen \u2013 queen of\nmodern pop, master of the\nbreak-up ballad, Canada\u2019s\nnumber one producer of\nsad bops (sorry Drake)\n\u2013 has yet again obtained\nthe top spot in this year\u2019s\nalbum listings with E.MO.\nTION.\n\u2018But wait!\u2019 I hear you\ncry, \u2018wasn\u2019t E.MO.TION,\nMs Jepsen\u2019s wig-snatch-ing, banger-stuffed, epic-for-our-times actually\nreleased in 2015?\u2019 Yes,\ndear reader, you are indeed\ncorrect.

In \u201cCuckoo\u201d,\nwritten by Lisa Carroll\nand set in Ireland, these\nthemes are explored on\na whirlwind journey of\npopularity, insecurities\nand general teenage angst.\nIona, played by Caitriona Ennis, has spent her\nwhole life yearning to be\npart of the popular crew.\nHer mute non-binary\nfriend Pingu, played by\nElise Heaven, convinces\nher to leave the small\ntown of Crumlin, Ireland\nfor a new life in London.\nAll of a sudden, the\npopular crew \u2013 Toller\n(Sade Malone), Pockets\n(Colin Campbell) and\nTrix (Peter Newngton) \u2013\ntake an interest in them\nand the drama of teenage\nlife ensues! The plot is not\nthe most original, but the\njourney that each character goes on is incredibly\nemotive. Pingu is able to\nconvey so much with so\nfew words (none). Their\ncharacters are unique and\nwell executed; the manner\nwith which the non-binary\nelement is introduced\nand developed is perfect.\nOther writers should take\nnotes! Iona and Toller\nare quite unimaginative\ncharacters who go on the\nusual expected journeys:\nthe loser who realizes\nwhat she had all along\nand the popular girl who\nrealizes being nice doesn\u2019t\nhurt. That being said, the\nactors all execute their\ncharacters brilliantly.\nWith such a small cast\n(only five people) and\napproximately two hours\nof high energy material\nwithout an interval, the\nendurance of these actors\nmust be admired.\nThe script constantly\nthrows in references\nwhich hit a sweet spot\nfor millennials. Iona, for\nexample, lists her London\ntodolist:\u201cthebigTopshop,\nMinistry of Sound and\nWetherspoons\u201d. Phones\nare used throughout the\nperformance. Whether it\nbe actors texting, taking\npictures or watching\nsnapchat stories, these\nmoments always worked\nwith the plot and did not\nfeel forced. The themes\nof popularity, adolescence\nand bullying might be universal but by integrating\nsocial media, this modern\ntake is all the more mean-ingful.\nThe audience was\nseated in a few rows facing\neach other, with a space in\nthe middle, the stage. This\nmade for some slightly\nuncomfortable moments\nas you could find yourself\nstaring at someone in the\naudience across. This did\nhowever make for a truly\nshared experience as you\ncould literally see others\ngoing through the same\nemotions, evoked from\nthe play, as you were. The\nactors would storm onto\nand off the stage in different directions, making\nfor a dynamic experience.\nMusic was very impor-tant, especially for setting\nthe scene as a party, just\noutside a party, or even\na chicken shop. Strobe\nlighting was used to\nrecreate the slow-motion\nclubbing scenes which are\nso ubiquitous to coming-of-age TV shows.\nOverall, this play is\nperfect for the binge\nwatching generation,\nwho won\u2019t want to take\ntheir eyes off of it. It is at\ntimes funny, at times sad,\nand at times moving but\nit is definitely unique in\nrelation to the characters,\nthe stage setup and the\noverall execution.\nJeannie: An Enchanting Revival\nA\nlong-overdue\njourney into the\nrepertoire of\nan overlooked\nfemale playwright, this\nis (shockingly) the first\nprofessional production\nof Jeannie in nearly\n80 years. Within two\nhours we are taken on a\nwhirlwind journey with\nprotagonist Jeannie, who,\nupon receiving a generous\ninheritance following the\ndeath of her cantankerous\nfather, ventures outside\nher \u201cwee one-eyed\u201d town\nand manages to attract\nthe attentions of both a\nBritish washing machine\ninventor named Stanley,\nand a Viennese Count.\nThe very small,\nintimate theatre allowed\nthe audience to become\ntotally wrapped up in the\nstory, and the set transitions help to signpost\nwhere you are in the play\nand transform the space\ncompletely. The only\ntrouble with these transitions was that they did\nlag on at times, ultimately\ndetracting from the im-mersive experience of the\nplay. However, I do see\nthat this was unavoidable\nwith the drastic location\nchanges between various\ncountries, and admire the\nfact that the actors both\nplayed their roles and\ncarried out the staging\ntransitions simultaneously\nas smoothly as possible.\nThe performances of\nMairi Hawthorn (Jeannie)\nand Matthew Mellalieu\n(Stanley) really stood out\nfor me, with their natural\nchemistry and wonderfully witty repartee; after a\nslow first few scenes, the\nplay only really started\nfor me when the pair first\nmet. The entire cast nailed\nevery bit of dialogue in\nall its emotion and charm\n\u2013 even the questionable\nFrench and Austrian\naccents only added to\nthe humour of the play.\nBut the real magic of the\ndialogue is all thanks\nto the mastery of the\nplaywright herself, Aim\u00e9e\nStuart (1886-1981). With\na life full of questioning\nconventions and seeking\nadventure, she\u2019s incredibly underrated as an artist\n(what with her previously\nbanned play Love of\nWomen, which polemi-cally depicted lesbianism,\nit\u2019s a real mystery that I\u2019d\nnever come across her).\nThe play isn\u2019t\nground-breaking in its\nmessage or its themes,\nnor is it written as such.\nRather it sends us home\nwith a very real message\n\u2013 one that is universal and\nunrestricted by the era in\nwhich we encounter it, be\nit the first show in 1940\nor 2018 in Finborough\nTheatre. This is the story\nof a flawed and na\u00efve\nwoman, who indeed\nmakes mistakes, yet at\nthe same time gives as\ngood as she gets with\na fiery personality and\ndetermination to pave her\nown path. I\u2019m certain we\ncan all see a part of ourselves in this character.\nIt\u2019s a beautiful rendering\nwhich states that yes, life\ncan be harsh and not at all\nwhat you expect, but at\nthe same time it\u2019s never\ntoo late to start your own\nadventure, and it\u2019s always\nworth the risk.\nBirds of a feather // David Gill\nARTS\nEamon Farhart\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "ISSUE 1708\nFELIX\n10\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs mass immigration compatible with the idea\nThe question of mass immigration is neither new or one we have dared to think more\nCOMMENT\nAuguste Rodin\nComment Writer\nPerhaps to begin answering this question we\nshould start by defining\nwhat really is national-ism. As with many other\nabstract concepts, what\ntends to happen is that different communities chose\nto define the concept in a\nwaythatsuitstheiragenda,\nbut in the simplest way of\nputting it, nationalism \u201c\u2026\nis primarily a political\nposition, which holds that\nthe national unit and the\npolitical unit should be\ncongruent\u201d according to\nErnest Gellner.\nSo, what does this\nstatement actually mean?\nIn physical terms it means\nthat the community that is\nbeing considered would\nbe the same community\nthat is in power. Arguably,\nthis seems like a very\nlegitimate concept that\ncoincides with the right\nof self-determination. You\nhave the inherent right as\na community to decide\nwho governs you, and as\na general rule, we tend\nto choose governments\nmade out of people that\nthink like us, that we\nidentify with and that we\nbelieve represent us as\nmuch as possible. But this\ncan break down in two sit-uations: firstly, when the\ncommunity demographic\nshifts in a very sudden\nand inorganic manner and\nthus the government is\nno longer representative\nof said community, or\nalternatively, when the\ncommunity is too diverse\nfor it to be accurately and\nfairly represented by one\nparty in power.\nBoth of these instances\ncan arise as a consequence\nof mass immigration,\nbecause ultimately, this\nsignificantly shifts the\ndemographic of the nationhood that is being represented in an unnaturally\nfast way, and thus means\nthat there is a disconnect\nbetween the \u2018national unit\u2019\nand the \u2018political unit\u2019.\nHowever, this does\nnot mean that a functional government is not\nviable when the nation\nis diverse in background\nand ethnicities, and there\nare many case studies of\nthriving countries that\nhave established their\ngovernment as federal\nor community based, or\nsimilar structures that are\nsub-divided to represent\neach \u2018sub-national unit\u2019.\nAn interesting example\nto look at is Lebanon,\ndividing its parliament\nseat allocation according\nto religious groups, to\nensure all of them are\nrepresented to one extent\nor another. Paradoxically,\nthis example can also\nbe used to illustrate the\nexact opposite argument:\nbecause communities\nshould govern them-selves. Lebanon has had\nto engineer its way around\nthe fact that its community is so diverse, in order to\nfully and optimally represent all of the groups and\npreserve said congruence\nthat nationalism requires.\nBut then again, this begs\nthe question: what really\nis a community? Is it a\nreligion, as the Lebanese\ngovernment model could\nlead us to think? Is it a collective of same language\nspeakers? Is it even race?\nHistory has proven that it\nis both none of them and\nall of them at the same\ntime.\nMaybe that is the true\nquestion that we should be\nasking, and if had known\nthe answer we would have\nsaved humanity a lot of\nbloodshed. Africa would\nhave not been so poorly\ndivided by its colonisers\nusing a geographical\ncriterion as opposed to\na nation/tribe-based\ncriterion, thus avoiding a\nvery large proportion of\ntribal wars and conflicts.\nPerhaps we would also\nunderstand that nations\nturn they often resort to\ncultural appropriation of\nthe Palestinian culture).\nBut for the sake of the\nquestion we have posed\ntoday, let us accept that\na nation is a community\nunited through characteristics they share such\nas, but not necessarily;\nreligion, culture, common\nhistory, language amongst\nothers.\nHaving taken a slight\ndetour to establish what\nwe think is a nation,\nand what nationalism is,\nwe return to the initial\nquestion: can mass immigration be compatible\nwith nationalism? The\nanswer, I believe, depends\non a very important\nfactor: whether or not the\nimmigrating community\nis the same one that then\nacquires power or not.\nLet us assume that the\nmigrating community\ndoes not then go on to be\nrepresented by the organ\nin power. In that case\nthey are not compatible,\nsince the core definition\nof nationalism relies on\nthe fact that both the\ngoverned and the governors are the same. If the\namount of immigration\nis of a smaller scale, the\nshift in demographic traits\nis less perceivable and\nthus a significant change\nin the government body\nis not of utmost necessity.\nThe extent to which the\nprinciple of nationalism\nis violated is not notable\nenough for us to say that\nthe link between both\nentities has been broken.\nHowever, because we are\nspecifically outlining that\nthe order of magnitude of\nthe immigration wave is\nmuch higher, this means\nthat there is an upset in the\nequilibrium of the system.\nMigrant family running away from tear gas at Mexican American border/ / Reuters\ncannot be manufactured\nartificially, and it would\nmake it very obvious to\nthe international community what the aim of\nIsrael is. They too seem\nto ask themselves what a\nnation is, and are trying\nto tick some sort of\nchecklist of ingredients\nyou need in order to form\none: religion (Judaism),\nhistory (their alleged historical claim to the holy\nland), language (reviving\nHebrew, that had ceased\nto be an everyday spoken\nlanguage somewhere\nbetween 200 and 400 CE)\nand culture (this one much\nharder for them given as\nthe Israeli community is\nmade up of many different\nnationalities and radically\ndifferent cultures, so in\ncompatible with nationalistic governments and their ideas?\nCOMMENT\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nDECEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n11\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf we were to consider\nnational unit as a balance\nof two sides, and the\nnation as one weight\non the balance, and the\ngovernment as the other,\nnationalism merely says\nthat both must be in equi-librium, the weight being\na metaphor as to how truly\nthe government represents\nthe nation. Adding mass\nimmigration into the\nequation means that the\nbalance tilts towards the\nnation very suddenly, and\nunless you adjust the gov-ernment, the equilibrium\nbreaks and the proposal\nof nationalism no longer\nholds true.\nAlternatively, there\nare two scenarios where\nmass immigration is still\ncompatible with nation-alism. The first one, as\npreviously mentioned,\nis when the government\nis re-adjusted to suit the\nneeds of the new demo-graphic. Most examples\nof this situation generally\ninvolve a colonial community forcibly removing\nthe native community\nthrough mass immigration\nand imperialistic use of\npower, and it is through\nthese same tactics that the\nnew government is put in\nplace to maintain the nationalistic principle. Some\nexamples include the\nUnited States of America,\nwith their mass immigration and ultimately almost\neliminating the Native\nAmericans originally\nliving in the land, and\nsimilarly, the same can be\nsaid about Australia.\nAnother possibility\nwhich is in fact subtler\nForced mass Palestinian migration during al Nakba(Arabic name for their ethnic cleansing)// Wikipedia\nbut just as interesting can\nbe very clearly illustrated\nin the example of Jordan.\nJordan is a country of\nabout 9 million people\n(CIA, 2018), where 2\nmillion are Palestinian\nrefugees (UNRWA,\n2018) and an even higher\nproportion of which are\nof Palestinian descent.\nIn this particular case the\ngovernment was never\nchanged from a monarchy,\nand there were no major\ninternal conflicts within\nthe Jordanian society\nitself. The influx of Palestinians was not organic, as\nit was triggered by mass\nethnic cleansing, so this is\nindeed a suitable example\nto consider as mass immi-gration. It is worth noting\nthat there was a full-scale\nwar between Jordan and\nPalestine from 1970 to\n1971, known as the Black\nSeptember (ThoughCo,\n2015), but this is not\nrelated to the coexistence\nbetween Palestinians and\nJordanians within Jordan.\nThis is another example\nwhere a community of a\nsignificant enough size\nexisted within a host community without disrupting\nthe existing government,\nand the nationalistic\nproposal did not in fact\nhold true.\nOn the other hand, an\nargument that mass immigration is not compatible\nwith nationalism is the\nfact that when the colonial\ncommunity is unsuccessful in fully establishing\nitself, the native community usually restores\nnationalistic balance\nthrough a revolution that\nenables them to be represented by a government\nof their own community.\nSome case studies include\nAlgeria and India, both\nrespectively succeeding\nin removing the colonial\nbody from power since\nthe nation\u2019s demographic\ndid not in fact, match the\ndemographic in power.\nThis furthers the notion\nthat mass immigration is\nincompatible with nation-alism, because the reason\nwhy the revolution occurs\nis to restore the connection between the people\nand their leaders.\nUltimately, I believe\nit is safe to conclude that\nthe very basic principle of\nnationalism, that nations\nshould govern them-selves, holds true in most\nof the situations of recent\nmodern history, and that\nmass immigration, unless\nfollowed by a re definition\nof the governing body,\nwill upset the established\nequilibrium, and thus is\nnot compatible with nationalism\u2019s core principle.\nof nationhood that nationalism requires?\nthoroughly about.

Despite this,\nI was criticised for not\nbeing a dedicated enough\nscientist and didn\u2019t\nlove what I was doing\nenough.

She could\nbe half-jokingly compared\nto the character of the\nBlack Knight in Monty\nPython\u2019s Holy Grail who\nkept fighting King Arthur\neven after losing his four\nlimbs. In an ironic twist,\nher constant resilience\nmirrors that of Labour\nleader Jeremy Corbyn,\nher fiercest opponent in\nParliament (at least when\nlooking across the floor),\nwho has also survived\ncountless plots against\nhis leadership. However,\ntime is running out for the\nPrime Minister, as next\nweek Parliament votes on\na Brexit deal that does not\nlook like it has the support\nof a majority of MPs.\nHow did we get here?\nThree weeks ago, the\nPrime Minister finally\nreached a deal with the\nEuropean institutions on\nBrexit, which included\nprerogatives on issues\nas varied as the rights\nand obligations of the\nEU citizens staying in\nthe UK after the country\nleaves the bloc and the\nborder situation between\nthe UK and the Republic\nof Ireland. However, this\nvictory proved to be short-lived as several cabinet\nministers, chief among\nthem Brexit Secretary\nDominic Raab (who was\nsupposed to be the main\nnegotiator behind the\naccord) swiftly resigned,\nciting deep disagreements\nwith the deal and the\nnegotiation strategy of\nthe Prime Minister. The\nproblem for May lies in\nthe fact that among the\nministers that left the\ngovernment one can find\nboth ardent Brexiteers and\npassionate Remainers,\nindicating that the deal\nsatisfies nobody but the\nmost loyal supporters of\nthe Prime Minister in her\nparty. Her situation has\nbeen further complicated\nby the permanent threat of\na confidence vote against\nher leadership plotted by\nthe Conservative MPs of\nthe hard-core Eurosceptic European Research\nGroup, led by Jacob\nRees-Mogg and former\nmayor of London and\nformer Foreign Secretary\nBoris Johnson. So far,\nit looks that the rebel\nTories do not have enough\nsupport within the party\nto trigger the vote against\nMay, but this impasse\ncould be broken next\nweek.\nOn Tuesday 11th\nDecember 2018, the\nhonourable members of\nthe House of Commons\nwill vote on accepting\nthe Brexit deal brought\nby Theresa May\u2019s gov-ernment. It is unlikely\nthat they will. Leaving\naside the fact that the\npractical entirety of the\nLabour, Scottish National\nand Liberal Democrat\nparties will vote against\nit, the Prime Minister has\nlost the support of her\nmain parliamentary ally,\nthe Northern Irish DUP.\nThis deprives her of an\neffective majority to pass\nthe deal, and her mission\nis further constrained by\nthe opposition of up to\n60 Conservative MPs that\nwill not vote for her, according to some sources.\nTherefore, several scenarios are open once the\nrejection of the accord\nbecomes a matter of fact.\nWhat could happen?\nWell, for once May may\nresign, leading to a leadership election within the\nConservative Party. The\nnew leader (who would\nautomatically become\nthe Prime Minister) may\nseek to renegotiate the\ndeal or just scrap it and\nleave the EU without any\nhas refused to concede\none more inch) fails to\npass, the government will\ncollapse and a general\nelection will be called.\nMay does not need to\nresign for a people\u2019s vote\nto occur. If she sees that\nParliament will not be able\nto make a decision, she\nmay call for an election,\nor even a rerun of the\nreferendum. The EU has\nheavily implied that the\ntransition period could\nbe expanded if the British\ngovernment decides to\nbring the issue again to\nthe voters. Of course,\nthe question and options\nwill surely prove to be a\nvery controversial issue,\nand one cannot ignore\nthat, again, she will have\nto ask for parliamentary\napproval in order to hold\nanother electoral process.\nThere is yet a third\nscenario, which involves\nMay refusing to resign the\npremiership. She could try\nEnjoy this weekend, Prime Minister, as it may be the last in your current job // BBC\n\u201cOn Tuesday\n11th December\n2018, the\nhonourable\nmembers of\nthe House\nof Commons\nwill vote on\naccepting\nthe Brexit\ndeal brought\nto them by\nTheresa May\u2019s\ngovernment\u201d\nkind of deal whatsoever.\nThe latter possibility has\ngrown less likely this\nweek as Remainers in the\nConservative Party have\nreached a secret agreement with Labour that\nwould allow Parliament to\nblock the no-deal option.\nIf this new deal (which is\nunlikely to be negotiated\nin the first place as the EU\n\u201cTime is\nrunning out\nfor the Prime\nMinister, as\nnext week\nParliament\nvotes on a\nBrexit deal\nthat does not\nlook like it has\nthe support of\na majority of\nMPs\u201d\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nDECEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n9\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nNow\u2019s the time to tune back into US news\nThe lemmings in power are jockeying for pole position, to be the first off the cliff in January.\nM\ne r r y\nG r i t m a s .\nS i n c e\nParliament\nvoted to hold the government in contempt, I\u2019ve\nbeen jerkin\u2019 it constantly,\nand have released more\n\u201clegal advice\u201d than I knew\nmy body could produce.\nWell, let\u2019s get to it.\nThe Mueller probe is\nchugging along. Trump\nis now known to be \u201cIndividual 1\u201d - the central\nfocus of the investigation.\nLegal briefs mention all\nsorts of misconduct with\nthe term \u201cIndividual 1,\u201d\nincluding close work with\naides relating to the RusPOLITICS\nGritty\nLeft Forum Chair\nsia-Trump Tower deal.\nSpicily, Trump was to\noffer Putin a $50 million\npenthouse in Trump\nTower Moscow, ostensibly to convince oligarchs\nto buy up properties in\nthe building. Negotiations\nover the deal carried on\nwell into Trump\u2019s candidacy - placing Trump in\ndirect legal peril.\nThe Feds have recently\nraided the Chicago offices\nof alderman Ed Burke,\nwho consulted on Trump\u2019s\ntaxes for 12 years. There\nbe spicy information in\nthose there filing cabinets.\nCan\u2019t wait to see what\ncomes out of this tangle.\nSpeaking of raids\n- Deutsche Bank got\na visit from German\npolice carrying out a\nmoney-laundering probe.\nYou might remember\nDeutsche Bank - former\nassociate SCOTUS justice\nAnthony Kennedy\u2019s son\nran the real-estate division\nthat bailed Trump out\nduring the Great Recession, when nobody else\nwould. Spice, spice, spice.\nJanky dealings the whole\nworld over - a prosecution\nis coming soon, and it\u2019s\ngonna be better than\nWWE.\nManafort, Flynn, and\nCohen are expected in\ncourt; Flynn has apparently sang like a canary\n(Mueller\u2019s asked for no\njail time), and Cohen is\nnow openly contradicting\nTrump in his testimony.\nManafort will get the book\nthrown at him. Mueller\nis over-prosecuting;\nmore details are likely to\nemerge when the filings\nare completed.\nChanging tack, George\nHW Bush died. His\ndisability legislation was\ndecent; his dedication to\nbombing the Middle East\n(a thirst shared by his\nson) was not. Watching\nBob Dole get dragged\nout of his wheelchair to\npay tribute stands in well,\nmetaphorically, for the\nfeeling I have trying not\nto speak ill of the dead.\nWisconsin and\nMichigan Republicans\nare holding lame-duck\nsessions to attempt to limit\nthe power of the incoming\ngovernments. Bills\npassed include slowing\nan increase on minimum\nwage, axing paid sick\ntime for companies with\nfewer than 50 employees.\nOther provisions target\nthe authority of the attor-neys-general to prosecute\ncases, and even contradicting amendments to\nstate constitutions passed\nin the last election cycle.\nIn other words - they\u2019re\nfull of shit, and this is an\nunprecedented power-gr-ab. To the cheese-head\nRs: may your ventricles\npromptly clog like the\n2014 Congress.\nFinally, the House\nDems are pushing\nsweeping anti-corruption\nlegislation as their first\nbill in the majority. This\nbill, which will include\nprovisions for campaign\nfinance reform, strengthening ethics laws in the\nexecutive and judiciary,\nand expanding voting\nrights, will be introduced\nas HR.1 in early January.\nFor example - after holing\noffice in the Cabinet, individuals would be barred\nfor life from participating\nin lobbying groups. Other\nprovisions provide for\ntransparency in PAC\ndonations - which directly\ntargets the dark-money\ninfrastructure that evolved\nin the wake of the Citizens\nUnited ruling. A tenner\nsays it won\u2019t pass the\nSenate; Republicans have\nno shame.\nSpeaking of Bob Dole,\nand having no shame -one time he showed up\nto Congress, lobbying\nthem to adopt the UN\nDeclaration on the Rights\nof Disabled Persons; he\nsat in his wheelchair and\nwatched his own party\nvote down such a disgustingly humane measure. To\nreiterate a fundamental\nposition: our government\nis run by lizards.\nWell, folks - have a\npleasant end of term, a\nmerry Christmas, and a\nhappy new year. We\u2019ll\nbe back at the start of\nnext term, venting leftist\npropaganda into the void.\nIn time, comrades.\nto renegotiate the deal in\nBrussels, praying that the\nEU softens its position.\nThat can be guaranteed\nnot to happen (the EU is\nthe stronger party here),\nso this would most likely\nresult in the government\ncollapsing. Of course,\nMay may not even enjoy\nthe chance of carrying\non with the negotiation.\nHer position untenable,\nshe may be toppled by\nthe Tory rebels. Go back\nto the third paragraph of\nthe article to what would\nhappen. I know, Brexit is\na headache.\nNobody can claim in\nconfidence to know what\nwill happen. For what we\nknow, Theresa May may\nbe entering the last week\nof her tenure, bringing an\nend to an agonic and convoluted time in Number\n10. Or, maybe, she will\nprove her doubters wrong\nfor the nth time and\nsurvive the defeat by the\nskin of her teeth. Perhaps\nthe government will\nmiraculously get enough\nLabour defections to pass\nthe deal, giving an end to a\nnegotiated Brexit. Perhaps\nthe British voters will be\nrecalled to the polls again,\neither to vote for a new\ngovernment or to settle\nthe matter of Brexit once\nand for all. The only thing\nthat is secure is that, as it\nstands today, the United\nKingdom of Great Britain\nand Northern Ireland will\nleave the EU on the 11pm\nof the 29th March 2019,\nwhether there is a deal or\nwhether there is none. We\ncan only wait and see.\nA House divided // Sky News\n\n"
