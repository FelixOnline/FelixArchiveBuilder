After a rather uneventful train\njourney (there was no bar\nunlike the B.R. ferry) we\nreached Brussels, found our\nhotel and settled down for\nthe night\u2014or so the management thought!\nIt may be quite truthfully\nrecorded that a certain level\nof alcohol content was\nreached in the ' players'\nbloodstreams that night,\nbelow which it did not sink\nfor the following five days\u2014\nhowever, a relatively quiet\nevening, we merely found\nour way around that evil, oh\nso evil, city.\nBrussels University\nThe following Sunday\nafternoon we managed to\nturn out against a strong\nBrussels University side\u2014the\ngame was played on a rock\nhard pitch and in sweltering\nsunshine. These, more than\nthe opposing 15 Belgians, did\nmore to hold us to a14 all\ndraw although the side\nplayed some attractive rugby\nafter gaining their second\nwind (or was it after losing a great deal of beer through\nsweat and various other\nrather more forced methods ?) The University\nproved to be admirable hosts\nand by the time we arrived\nback to the city centre all\nthoughts of nursing bruised\nbones were speedily forgotten in a night of unforgettable action (some people\nStill bear the scars!)\nThe next day was to have\nbeen a free one in which the\ncity's many famous buildings and streets should have\nbeen admired, however the\nvisit to Wielman's brewery\nrather hindered this tourist\nactivity. Suffice it to say\nthat whereas various people\nwho set out with the intention of an early bedtime\nfound themselves again eating breakfast, bright and\nearly at 8 a.m.! Anderlecht\nThe second game was\nplayed against the National\nChampions \u2014 Anderlecht\nR.F.C. This was played\nunder floodlights on the\nTuesday evening on, again a grass less pitch \u2014 further\nhindered by teeming rain.\nHowever this proved a marvellous game, the college\nfinally winning by 6pts. to\n5pts. The standard of rugby\nwas exceptionally high and\nI hereby verify the party\n' redeemed' themselves in\nthe face of Union 'tax-payers '. Anderlecht proved\nto be even more riotous hosts\nand I must really apologise\nfor the team's performance\nback at Brussels that night\n\u2014everyone was in bed,\nsound asleep by 4 p.m.! A long and weary journey\nback to London was suffered\nthe next day and thanks to\nthe elements for a calm\ncrossing or we'd have lost a few on the way, I'm sure. A tour to rank with the\ngreatest, both on and off the\nfield and I hope future tours\nto Belgium fare so well\u2014\neven if it does take them the\nrest of the vac. to recover.\nOver the Easter Vacation both I.C. Rugby and Football clubs went on\ntour abroad . . . and neither lost\na single match.\nI.C.'s victorious Rugby Football team\nL. to r. top row: G. Everett, R. Furness, D. Barford, R. Voile, G. Widelski, A. Havelin,\nC. Green, M. Jones, W. Beauford.\nLower row: K. Devaney, M. Agg, A. Williams, M. Adams, P. Cox, P. Humphries, D. Mariott.\nFootball in Germany\nStanding 1. to r.: John Darley, John Kelly, Paul Worthington, Ken Hewitt, Noel Fryer,\nRoger Dixon, Tony Holland, Peter Willey.\nSitting 1. to r.: Bill Smith, Geoff Barnard, Doc. Stephens, Tom McCardle, Rick\nWidelski, Clarence Willcock.\nNot to be outdone by the\nEnglish professional league\nclubs playing Europe, April\n4th saw a party of I.C. footballers assembling at Victoria station eager to take on\nthe cream of German foot-ball. The journey to Karlsruhe in the heart of the\nRhineland was, on the\nwhole, without incident,\nthough the crossing was so\ncalm that certain members\nof the party endeavour ed to\nsimulate seasickness by\nmaking use of duty-free\nliquor to be found on the\nboat.\nThe party arrived in\nKarlsruhe to find a blizzard\nraging. However, our affable\nGerman host, Axel Goerrinjer, efficient as only the\nGermans can be quickly\narranged a sightseeing tour\non foot and a visit to the\nswimming pool. In case this\nwasn't sufficient to give\neveryone pneumonia the\nafternoon was spent watching a local league amateur\ngame on a cold windswept\nground.\nAfter spending the first\nnight in a hotel in Karlsruhe\nthe party moved the next\nday to stay at a sport school in Durlack a few miles outside the city. The sport-school was situated at the\ntop of a steep mountain and\nwas arrived at by climbing\nabout 500 steps. It seemed,\nat first glance, that it would\nBy John Darley\nbe completely unassailable\nin an inebriated condition.\nFirst Match\nThe first match of the\ntour was played against a village team Spock which\nplayed in the 2nd amateur\ndivision. The pitch had\nobviously been lightly gravelled for the game Which\nwas played in the evening\nunder what were described\nas floodlights. This was\napparently a German joke\nwhich was lost on the\nEnglish players who could\nonly see six 40 watt bulbs\nhanging on telegraph poles.\nThe only time the I.C. goalkeeper could see the ball\nwas when it was lying in the\nback of the net and, not\nsurprisingly I.C. were 5\u20142\ndown at half-time. In the\nsecond half I.C. played with\ngreat determination and enthusiasm and were able to\nscore 3 very good goals after\n20 minutes. Although both\nsides tried hard after this\nthere was no further score\nand a draw was probably a fair result.\nAfter the game I.C. were\nentertained to a lavish supper consisting of many\nvarieties of German sausage.\nMost of these were very\nobviously unpalatable to the\nEnglish stomach judging\nfrom the scenes of the sport-school later in the evening\u2014\nthough this condition could\npossibly have been brought\non by a mixture of beer,\nschnapps and wine.\nThe next day the party\nvisited a perfume factory in\nthe morning, a rather\narduous task considering the\nstate of most people's stomachs, and in the afternoon played a series of 5-a side games against local\nteachers. The I.C. first squad\nlost 2\u20141 but were avenged\nby the second team who won\n9\u20145.\nThe second full game of\nthe tour was played on the\nThursday evening on a much\nbetter pitch and under very\ngood lights. A very even\ngame saw I.C.2 \u20141 up with\nabout 5 minutes to go but\nWiesloch equalise d with a long shot to give I.C. their\nsecond draw of the tour.\nThe last full day of the\ntour started With a Civic\nReception in the town hall\nfollowed by a guided tour by\nbus to Karlsruhe and the\nsurrounding area. In the\nafternoon Axel and some of\nhis friends took the party by\ncar into the Black Forest\nand a very pleasant afternoon was spent walking in\nthe snow covered hills.\nThis short football tour\nwas made especially enjoyable by the generous hospitality of the German hosts\nwho soon became very good\nfriends of all the players and\nit is hoped that sometime in\nthe future I.C. will be able\nto repay their hospitality.\n\n"

Only one\nlesson seems to have become more clear, and that by the\nRector and Board of Studies' new found haste to settle\noutstanding student demands. By electing flaxen-haired Judith\nWalker, the left-wing candidate at last term's college-wide\ntwo-day Presidential ballot, I.C. students did just the thing\nBill Penney, top Admin, and Profs had convinced themselves would never happen again. They elected, albeit by\na majority slightly more slender than Miss Walker's attractive\nfigure, a candidate pledged to follow President Piers Corbyn's energetic policies. When the left also finished ahead in all\nthe major contests it looked increasingly as if this year's policies would be continued. Since then there has been a significant if subtle change of attitude on the part of the\nAdmin. Before the election they were prepared to stall over\nvital issues in the hope that Piers-type Presidency would be\nrejected by the students they were convinced were so\napathetic. Now the Board of Studies has agreed to the\nstudent request for observers and even well buried chestnuts\nsuch as discipline have been dug up by the Rector and are\nbeing pressed by him with all urgency, so different from\nthe pre-election somnolence.\nGuiltyjjSecret\nThe election voting shows that a significant number of\nI.C. students have discovered what is often called: 'history's guilty secret.' That those who make the fuss and agitate\nusually get their Way \u2014 and that this to the man without\npower is the only weapon. In this country this secret has\nbeen well hidden since Gladstone first elucidated it, with\ngood reason too, as it can be a weapon for the unjust as well\nas the oppressed. Whereas Piers Corbyn swept home last year\non a tide of dissatisfaction with a stagnant Union, the right-wing, and it appeared 'the powers-that-be' also, were convinced that his unorthodox tactics, and at times harassment of Admin, had alienated sufficient I.C. students to\nfacilitate a right-wing landslide.. Although there was undoubtedly such a movement, increasing numbers of undergraduates had seen the success that direct action had brought\nto other less well behaved students, and that Piers' tactics\nhad already had some success at I.C. Stalwarts\nThat is not to say that campaigns did not make a vital\nimpact. John Darley, backed by the Rugby Club and the\nother bastions of the Union's one-time right-wing bosses, ran\na long and expensive campaign. No-one could doubt that\nhe was well organised, he was given significant support from\nconstituent college stalwarts, but made three fatal mistakes.\nFrom the start Darley faced a dilemma, could he afford\nto ignore the new mood of the Union and refuse to put\nstudent demands (e.g. B.o. St. representation) in his policies,\nor if he included them how could he promise success yet\neschew direct action. At the hustings this dilemma and his\nlack of political experience were cruelly exposed. Secondly\nhis over zealous supporters by tearing down other posters\nand mud-slinging pamphlets angered many moderate\nstudents. It was his mud-slinging pamphlets which beyond\ndoubt were to cost Darley the election, in which he fought\nwith increasing frenzy, as still more expensive posters failed\nto stop the Walker band^wag gon. We shall return later to\nthis third blunder.\nSoul-searching\nBearded Brian Hains, the eager beaver Academic Affairs\nOfficer, who finished third in the three cornered contest,\nstarted early favourite. Indeed at first the left tried to\ndissuade Hains from standing, offering him instead C.E.F. E. support if he ran for secretary. After much soul searching\nHains refused and by gaining fewer than 300 votes went\non to prove that to be a viable candidate you need the support of an established political grouping. Poor Brian, right\nfrom the start things went wrong for him, at an early stage\nhe began to lose self-confidence and even failed to star\nat the hustings, where he should have known all the answers.\n\"A significant number of I.C. students have discovered history'\nguilty secret. Those who make the fuss and agitate usually g their own way1' It seems a candidate must have the stuff to take a good\ndeal of blows beneath the belt.\nThe election seemed inexplicably to catch the left with,\nin one case literally, their trousers down. Only at the last\nminute did Judith Walker emerge as a candidate, and at\nthat stage her feminine charm, considered now to have been\na trump card, was thought to be a grave liability (it certainly did lose her, ironically, a good number of female\nvotes). Dave Wield appeared out of hibernation to organise\nher campaign brilliantly. J. H. Wilson would have marvelled\nhow the mounting flow of manifest a toes, posters and slogans,\npeaked exactly on polling day. Of course the unstoppable\nband-wagon was purely accidental resulting more from a late-start than a master plan.\nMud-slinging\nIt was always obvious that with Hains the Centrist candidate and the use of single transferable votes, he only had\nto finish second to win. It looked that way until the final few\ndays, by polling day it was Obvious he would finish third\nand the winner would be the candidate who most successfully captured the second choice notes of Hains' supporters.\nTo this end Walker's campaign acquired a strange respectability as polling approached, yet inexplicably and quite\nfatally Darley brought out the by now notorious mud-slinging\nsheet. In their enthusiasm to libel Piers and equate him\nwith Judith Walker they c oud n't resist kicking a man when\nhe's down, and as far as Darley should have been concerned,\nout. By calling Hains, amongst other such complimentary\nphrases 'insipid', he lost many Hains' second choices. When\nthe first co ices were counted Darley was only behind by 82\n(604 to 522) and he gained the major share of Hains' vote\n(147 to 96), without that pamphlet surely he would have won\n16 more voters who turned to Judith or the 32 Hains' men\nwho did not use their second choice, and that of course\nwould have been just enough to squeeze in. Strange that\nthe champions of direct action should win because the traditional British sense of fair play was violated.\nThe others\nThe Secretarial election, a straight right (Pete Poods\nstanding on Darley's ticket) versus Centre-left fight resulted\nin a personal triumph for Geoff Needham. Needham surprised even his keenest supporters with a majority of over\n200. Woods it was rumoured spent close on \u00a350 on his\ncampaign and his preponderance of posters over Needham,\nwho ran on a shoe-string budget, was emphasised by the\ndestruction of most of Needham's few by Woods' supporters.\nOf all the candidates Needham was far the most impressive\nat the hustings, his openness and good humour contrasting\nsharply with Welfare Officer Woods' laconic answers, which\nmade the latter look surly, whereas the former came over\nas open and friendly. At one stage Hains and Needham\nwere on the same ticket, but after Hains' appearance of\ngrovelling before the Rector when he addressed the Union\nmeeting a rift opened, and thereafter the campaigns developed\nindependently. It was this independence by the Social Clubs\nChairman that swung the left votes and C.E.F. E. machine\nbehind him. His victory remains the most encouraging part\nof the election, proving that to win, out-poste ring your\nopponent is not sufficient.\nTony Kirkham's walk away victory in the Deputy\nPresident election was probably due to his efficient campaign.\nCareful and tasteful bump f sheets secured for him the\nnecessary image and majority of nearly 300.\nAttitudes\nThe final collapse of the once grand design of Darley\nand his group to capture the three Exec, seats, the three\nUnion Officers' jobs and all eleven departmental reps was\nfinally shattered when they made only one significant gain,\nDave Hobman became External Affairs officer. Thus the\nUnion can be expected to take a largely no change stand on\nmost issues, although the momentum is still to the left.\nIt is this continuing swing that has surprised the Rector and\nthe Admin, so certain that Piers lacked grass-roots support.\nTheir reaction has been to speed up their response to Union\ndemands. They can no longer, as at the last J.U.R. G.O., question the desire of students for real change in I.C., or\nthe depth of criticism of present structures and policies.\nAbove all it could mean far reaching shifts in attitudes if\nI.C. students really have found out 'history's guilty secret'.\nby\nLes\nEbdon\nThe ones\nthat made\nit:-Tony\nKirkham\nGeoff\nNeedham\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPFRIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nEditor: Dave Chant\n!

However,\nI.C, took the lead midway\nthrough the first half and\nheld on until a momentary\nlapse in defence gave Groningen the equalise r. Two games the next day\nprovided us with a couple\nof victories. I.C. were always in command against\nGroningen 2nd and with a splendid hat-trick from Pete\nBates ran out comfortable\n4\u2014-2 winners.

This\nworked extremely well and\nI.C. combined really well,\n;playing some splendid\nhockey. Everyone played\nexceptionally well and it is\nperhaps unfair to single out\nindividuals.. However, mention must be made of Julian\nSargent and Robin King who\nplayed solidly in defence\nand the forward line as a whole which created some\nexcellent openings which\nmer st nith and lost the final\nof Junior Seniors by three\nfeet to Auriol.

Robson,\nDepartment of Electronic\nand Electrical Engineering,\nThe University, Sheffield\nSI 3JD. Street, London, W l), one of\nthe few outlets for the work\nof young and modern play-wrights, is showing two plays\nby David Mowat: The Normal Woman and Tyyppi.\nBoth plays are an analysis\nand an attack on so-called\nnormality. The standard of\nacting was distinguished not\nonly in character portrayal\nbut also in the almost\nchoreographed production of\nthe plays. In Tyyppi, Doreen\nMantle plays an interviewee\nwho finally reveals a facet\nof sadism so intense that it\nis only credible within the\ncontext of the play. Similarly\nin The Normal Woman she\nplays a teacher in a mentally\nsub - normal ward. The\npatients are played by Hilary\nWestlake, Michael Mould\nand Tony Rohr. The play\nfollows through to an obvious climax where the teacher is reduced to the child-like, but sexual level of the\npatients.\ntreated all his own side's dead and wounded as heroes, to\nBradley, the steady, thoughtful, rather mundane professional\nsoldier. Patton was a great military historian and one is made\nto feel sorry for him, because he was continually being\nfrustrated by the petty squabbles of politicians.\nHistory proved him right on many points. However his\nmethods were harsh and some might even say immoral, but\nthen a streak of fanaticism is the mark of a great general.\nWe are shown the continual struggle between Montgomery\nand Patton for the position of Prima Donna of Europe, and\nthe contrast is marked by the old school boy attitude of\nMontgomery and the gross manners of Patton.\nThere is a certain amount of Blood and Thunder, which\nconveys the general mood of war, but all the way through\nit, one gets that uneasy feeling that something isn't ringing\nquite true. It appears that the whole war was a chess game\nbetween Rommel and Hitler on the one hand and Patton,\nMontgomery and Eisenhower on the other. Everything is\njust a little too neat. However the main points are well driven\nhome and war for a change is not made out to be all heroism and fine deeds, although there is little to confirm the\nopposing view. As a character study the film is probably\naccurate though somewhat glib. George C. Scott gives a very good performance, probably the best of his long career\nand the film is worth seeing just for this. It hold one's attention throughout and has some very amusing quips. The\nphotography of course is expensive and good.\nWar from a different angle is portrayed in Haskell Wexler's brilliant film Medium Cool. It tells the story of a Television Film Man and his involvement with the riots of '68\nin Chicago. It pays attention to a host of seemingly irrelevant but actually very important details. Flashback technique is used at its best here and not just as gimmick, but\nas a way to convey a mood. A host of small incidents like\nthe one where the cops are more interested in the well-being\nof the Convention members than they are in a lost child\nbring home the dire distress of the ordinary person, helpless against the bureaucratic machine. The film man realises\nthat he and the media men have spent their lives filming\nother people without getting involved and when he finds\nout that the television station for Whom he works is in the\npay of the local government, he begins to think about his\nrole. The recent riots on the campuses of America and the\nincreased involvement of the Americans in South East Asia\nagainst the wish of the ordinary person in the USA make\nthis a very relevant film.\nCohen as author Leonard Cohen is a Canadian, best known for his\nsongs and singing. Last week\nhe gave his first one-man\nconcert in Britain at the Al bert Hall, and just over a month ago his novel \"Beau-ti ful Losers\" (Cape 30s.) was published in Britain.\nWhen I was thinking how\nto review the book, one\npoint that I thought I should\nstress was: \"It doesn't leave\nanything to the imagination\"\n\u2014Cohen's description of an\nageing scholar swamped with\nmemories of his dead Indian\nwife and homosexual boyfriend is as frank as it could\nbe. He goes into intricate details in describing various\nsexual perversions, and if\nthere are any words he has\nbeen afraid to use, I don't know them.\nYet, he does leave a great\ndeal to the imagination. The\nbook isn't all about cunts\nand fucking, though to open\nit at any page would give\nyou that impression; it is\nabout an old man whose\nwife committed suicide by\nsitting at the bottom of a lift-shaft, whose friend F. died\nof venereal disease leaving\nhim to rot in his treehouse in\nQuebec. He is obsessed with\na17 th century Indian saint,\nCatherine Tekakwitha, the\nIroquois virgin, about whom\nhe is trying to write a book.\nThat book is never finished;\nthe final section of the book\nsees the old man fleeing the\npolice in the city of Quebec.\nHe is finally insane.\nIt leaves a great deal to\nthe imagination because Leonard Cohen's style in writing\nthis novel is the style of an\nestablished poet and song-writer, he can write the\nthoughts of a deluded pervert in all their crudity, but\nhe can also describe the coming of spring to Canada:\u2014\n\"It flows over Ontario\nlike a dream of legislation,\nand it sneaks into Quebec,\ninto our villages, between\nour birch trees. In Montreal\nthe cafes, like a bed of tulip\nbulbs, sprout from their cellars in a display of awnings\nand chairs. In Montreal\nspring is like an autopsy\".\nBeautiful Losers is worth\nreading. It's not pornography, but it may be cruel.\nIf you let the idea that Cohen\nhas written a book about\nperversion turn you against\nthis book, you must never\nhave heard anyone sing\nSuzanne.\nOVERLAND TO\nRUSSIA\nALBANIA through the BALKANS,\nSCANDINAVIA\nEASTERN EUROPE\nInformal minibus camping\ntreks for mixed groups of\nadventurous young people.\n14 to 28 DAY TREKS\nFROM \u00a337\n'PROTREK' (Dvn.),\n100 Rochester Row,\nLondon, S.W.1.018343981 "

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX 14th May 1970\nAssociated Studies\n\"Helpless, naked, piping, loud\nLike a fiend hid in a cloud . . . \" \u2014 Blake\n\"Helpless\"?\u2014not entirely, but in urgent need of an academic co-or d in at or who can produce order out of the existing\nchaos: \"naked\"?\u2014in as much as there is no College policy\nwithin which Associated Studies may decently clothe itself\nand acquire academic respectability: \"piping\"?\u2014intermittent\ngovernment publications pleading the cause: \"loud\"?\u2014I.C. Students' Union, members of Associated Studies staff, Industry, Swann et. al. And \"fiendish\"?, the entire issue seems to\nhave acquired demoniacal undertones, more or less hidden\nby the fluctuating controversies surrounding it.\nCollege Policy\nBlake was talking about a newly-born infant, so the\nanalogy is not entirely apt, as I.C. has had some form of\nAssociated Studies in some departments, for at least seven\nyears. But unlike many universities in the States and several\nin the U.K., Imperial College has not seen fit to evolve a coherent College policy about subjects studied in association\nwith main disciplines. The pros and cons of the argument\nhave been debated liberally and not so liberally many\ntimes, but one more suggestion could be added to the stock-pile. The cause could be partly due to precedent\u2014a system\nwhich the law of the land employs to ensure historical continuity in legal matters. A system which is not noted for its\nspeed in assessing the changing needs and nature of society\nand establishing new precedents. So also I.C. The very name\n\"Imperial\" is indicative of the nature of the establishment:\n\"the spirit of empire or arb it ary power\", to all intents and\npurposes, not a concept which the mid-twentieth century\naims to foster.\nAt I.C. matters have reached a point where some more\ncoherent policy must be thought out. Several departments\nhave Associated Studies of a \"professional\" or an \"access\"\nnature and students in others are requesting that more\ncourses should be made available to more people. Employers\nare realising that it is impracticable to spend at least 2\nyears on a new graduate in industry, in order to condition\nhim out of academic isolationism and into the practical\napplications of his discipline. It is costly both in time and\nmoney to have \"fractions\" of staff lecturing to individual\ndepartments (part-time rates of pay are proportionally higher\nthan full-time salaries). Too many individual members of\nthe academic staff spend too much time administering existing\nAssociated Studies when there should be an administrative\ncentre to do this for them. Not so that we can increase the\nbureaucratic network in LC, but in order to allow academic staff more contact time with students and less with\npaper and telephones.\nACADEMIC DIRECTOR\nClearly an Academic Director would not only provide a much needed focal point for Associated Studies, but would\nalso have the task of co-ordinating existing courses and\ndevising new ones according to the fluctuating demands of\nthe College as a whole. It is equally clear that if BoST indicates that an Academic Director should be appointed,\nwhether he is recruited through advertisement in the Press\nor the \"old-boy\" network in the Club, such a man must be\ngiven some idea of College policy in the matter. Even if the\nlimbo of Associated Studies is explained to him, he must be\nmade aware of the Heaven and Hell either side.\nA.S. L.U. F. One attempt to central is e the issue has been made already.\nThe first edition of the Associated Studies Link-Up File, or\nAS LU F, has now been placed in each departmental library\nand in the Haldane and Lyon Playfair Libraries. This is a file which central is es information on most courses that are\ncurrently studied in connection with main disciplines, usually\nsubjects falling into an Arts or Social Sciences field.\nBut why \"Associated Studies\"? No one has attempted to\ndefine \"Non-Technical\", for the good reason that all subjects,\nwhether Arts, Social Science or Science oriented, have a technical basis. In the Diversification issue, subjects were\nbroadly categorised as being either Technical or Non-Technical, in order to separate out subjects which were main\nline disciplines in the College, but could be studied as sub-i diary subjects as well (e.g. Computing for Mathematicians as\nopposed to Computing for the CCA) these subjects being\n\"Technical\"; and then the \"others\"\u2014languages, literature,\nhistory, philosophy, economics, politics, sociology and so on,\nthese being considered \"Non-Technical\". As General Studies\nat I.C. is the umbrella under which lunch-time lectures and\nconcerts falls, it would add further confusion to label groups\nof subjects studied in connection with main disciplines, General Studies as well Apart from this, it is likely that the\nProf. C.D. Buchanan Mr. C.K. McDowaU\nTransport Touchstone, Gen. Studies\nwrong onus would be placed on subjects labelled either \"Gen-era l\", \"Liberal\", \"Complementary\". \"Ancillary\" or \"Subsi-diary\". All these titles tend to suggest a little gentle dabbling\nin culture, which is tacked on to the end of the serious business of studying. But \"what's in a name\"? to which one can\nonly reply, that if we have to label for the sake of con-veni en ce, \"Associated\" is nearer the spirit of the idea than\nthe other titles.\nBEHIND A.S.L. U.F.A SLU F is produced from the Associated Studies Office in\nCollege Block. The idea behind it is to produce a file, on\nthe lines of Kessing's Contemporary Archives, in which details of courses, controversies and other matters connected\nwith Associated Studies are gathered together under one\nheading, rather than having to resort to leafing through the\nCollege Calendar. Periodically, new material will be added\nand the indexes brought up to date. In an attempt to alleviate the built-in resistance most people have against cy clo styled material, each group of subjects has information printed on different coloured Sheets. Incidentally, it also makes\nit considerably easier to find out particular items of information throughout a period of time, as the pages are numbered consecutively from the inception of the file and additional material is added in the same colour spectrum each\ntime.\nThe first section comprises matters of general interest.\nThere is a flow chart of existing Associated Studies in the\nCollege and a diagram of the various committees which have\nsomething in common with Associated Studies. When the\nUGC Arts Sub-Committee visited the College in November\n1969, a comprehensive programme was given to them, which\ngave in outline the organisation of Associated Studies, the\npurposes of Associated Studies and credit carrying options.\nMinutes of the first major informative meeting on NonTechnical Studies are also included in this section.\nProf. A.R. Hall, History Mrs. A. Klein\nof Science and Technology Languages\nCONTROVERSIES\nThe final section, excluding comprehensive Name and\nSubject Indexes, contains the controversial meat of the\nissue. In December 1969, the AT TI( Association of Teachers\nin Technical Institutions) published a statement on General\nStudies, re-affirming the need and desirability of General\nCaroline Ward-Bailey\nreviews the situation\nin I.C. Studies, detailing the problems involved and suggesting the\ntype of framework in which such studies may well develop.\nIn the same month, the late Lord Jackson distributed a memorandum to all members of staff in the College, requesting comments and suggestions on Non-Technical Studies.\nAbout 500-600 memoranda were sent out, 26 replies were\nreceived. The replies have been selected into Pros and Cons\ncolumns, and further subdivided into various headings \u2022\u2014\nAcademic Respectability, Economic, Practical, Professional\nOrientation and Student Demands. By now, the result seems\nto be a collection of rather hackneyed arguments, but it does\nindicate the climate of opinion which surrounds Associated\nStudies fairly succinctly. Against the arguments presented\nby I.C. on Associated Studies, there are a few extracts\nfrom HM SO publications which affirm the government's opinions on the matter.\nAn article published in \"Liberal Education\" called \"The\nDemand for Non-Technical Studies at Imperial College\" by\nR. Mohan, J. Shields, D. Wield and Dr. J. S.R. Goodlad\nis also reproduced. The title speaks for itself. Finally an\narticle by Professor L.R. B. Elton of the University of\nSurrey called \"The assessment of Students\u2014a new approach\"\nProf. E.C. Cherry Mr. K.R. Minogue\nCommunication Politics\nconcludes the section. The title is somewhat ambiguous and\nis not a sociological approach to old phenomena, but an\narticle suggesting ways of accrediting academic work on a basis of time/difficulty indexes. Between these two sections\nthere are details of sections of departments which have something in common with Associated Studies, though they may\nnot run courses specifically for undergraduates. An example\nof this is Professor Buchanan's \"Transport\" section\u2014\"one\nof the major pre-occupations of mankind ever since the\ndawn of civilization\". Brief details of some major projects\nare given, followed by a short profile plus photograph of\nProfessor Buchanan. Another section is that of Professor\nCherry's \"Communication\" unit in Electrical Engineering,\nprimarily\u2014running courses for post-graduates but including\na lecture/seminar open to the entire College, called \"What is\nCommunication?\" Touchstone and General Studies, also\nindexed as an example of \"Sampling Studies\", which is organised by Mr. C.K. McDowall, has a section of its own,\nincluding a profile and photograph of the Touchstone Secretary.\nUnion matters are appropriately printed on amber coloured paper, including rather well-aired views on Diversification as a whole, the course unit system, the case for\nDiversification, General Studies, and extracts from its Quinquennial report, in particular. As yet, there are no revealing\ndetails of the lives of any of the major protagonists, but they\nmay well follow.\nAn extensive list of Electrical Engineering's Group Projects 1964-1970 is included and ranges from \"How should a University of the Air be organised?\" (1965) to \"Is the Concorde Worthwhile?\" (1966) and \"Energy supply for space\nheating\" (1966).\nASSOCIATED STUDIES COURSES\nThe bulk of the file is concerned with detailing courses\ncurrently in existence. The first group of courses are those\nrun by the Department of History of Science and Technology.\nPrincipally courses designed for post-graduates, there is one\ncourse designed for undergraduates in Chemical Engineering\nand Chemical Technology called \"The Chemical Industry\nand 19th century British Society\". Professor and Mrs. Hall\nhave volunteered both profiles and photographs of them-selves.\ncontinued on page 7\n\n"

John Docherty, a Welsh delegate, called for\nthe small colleges to show\ntheir strength and refused to\nleave the floor until he was\nassured by the exec, that\nsome way for the small colleges to express their views\ncould be found. He was given\na standing ovation by large\nsections of his audience.\nThe problems of small colleges were highlighted by\nspeeches pointing out that\nmost of their unions operated on an income of less than\n\u00a31 per head (compared with\nI.C.U.'s grant of \u00a36 per\nhead).\nThe revolt was partially\nresolved when it was decided\nat a small colleges meeting\nthat the best way to make\nsure that their views were\nheard in N.U.S. was to collaborate with Universities\nand neighbouring institutions\nin their home areas. I.C. is a pioneer of this sort of system\nwith the ' University of South\nKensington.' Evert more contacts were made with South\nWest London colleges during\nthe conference.\nGrants \u2014 Exec, defeated\nThe most important debates were those on disc ip line, representations, South\nAfrica and, of course, the\nbinary system of education.\nThe debate on grants highlighted a change in N.U.S. policy. Previous motions on\ngrants have been long and\ncomplicated. The N.U.S. exec, motion was defeated\nand one highlighting the\nworst aspects of grants (the\nabolition of discretionary\nawards) was passed. These\nawards are awarded by local\neducation authorities for\nnon-university courses. In\nsome H.E. A.'s there is a definite policy of restricting\nart college and mature stu-dents' grants. N.U.S. must\nnow fight harder to stop this\nprejudice.\nElections \u2014 Piers fails\nPiers Corbyn failed to get\nelected to the N.U.S. executive. He was supported in the\nelection by many of the\nsmaller colleges but the large\nblock votes of the larger Universities went for each others\ncandidates. The London vote\nwas also split.\nThere was a small swing\nto the left. The national\npress highlighted the election of the Communist Digby\nJacks as Secretary. He is in\nfact not a member of the\n' New Left' but an old style\ncommunist. The other ele c Travel\nIn 1970 there have been\nseveral new developments in\nthe field of eligibility for\nstudent transport.\nStudents wishing to use\ntravel facilities must be in\npossession of the International Student Identity Card before booking. This is a new\ncard introduced at the beginning of the year by the\nInternational Student Travel\nConference to give internationally accepted proof of\nthe bona fide student status\nof students travelling abroad.\nThe blue NUS card, although\nto add to the confusion it\nstill bears the title of International Student Identity\nCard, is only a membership\ncard of the National Union\nof Students in this country\nand it is no longer valid for\nbooking international student\ntravel facilities. Members of\nt ions produced a fair cross-section of student political\nopinion.\nThe change in N.U.S. was\nreflected in the debate on\nSouth Africa. For the first\ntime almost a whole day was\nspent discussing a political\nmotion. The views of most\nstudents at the conference\nwere reflected by one of the\nKeele delegation: ' Liberalism in South Africa is dead\n\u2014the only solution is the violent overthrow of the regime.'\nthe NUS receive the TSIC\nfree of charge and all other\nbona fide full time students\ncan obtain one for 6/-. These\ncards are available from\nNUS headquarters of Local\nStudent Travel Bureaux.\nThe rules for eligibility on\nstudent charter flights are\nmore restrictive than they\nhave been in the past. There\nis now an upper age limit of\n30 years for all full time stu-dents. Past students are no\nlonger eligible for flights except that they may use them\nup to 31st December of the\nyear in which they complete\ntheir studies. These restrictions on eligibility are not\nlaid down by NUS but by the\nEuropean Civil Aviation\nConference. Great Britain is\na member of ECAC and it\nis on the basis of NUSTS adhering to the conditions laid\ndown by ECAC that the Air Transport Licensing Board\ngrants the licences which are\nnecessary to operate the\nflights.\nFlights\nIn the summer of 1970\nNUS Travel Service will be\noperating somewhere in the\nregion of 1,500 flights to and\nfrom 44 destinations as opposed to 25 in 1969. New\nroutes include London to:\nNew York (\u00a361 or \u00a365 re-turn), Bilbao (\u00a310 10s. single), Bombay (\u00a362 10s. single), Budapest (\u00a315 single),\nCorfu (\u00a319 single), Hanover (\u00a39 5s. single), Japan\n(\u00a3187 10s. return), Oporto\n(\u00a313 single), Pisa (\u00a312 single),\nStuttgart (\u00a39 5s. single), Tangiers (\u00a318 single), and Rome\nto Malta (\u00a310 single) and\nTunis (\u00a38 7s. single). This\nyear the majority of flights\nchartered by NUS Travel\nService will be operated by\nBEA's new charter company,\nBE A Airtours. Flights operated by other members of\nthe Student Air Travel Association (SATA) can also\nbe booked through the NUS Travel Service and during\nthe summer of 1970 their\nmembers are operating a network of 260 routes.\nTrains\nEligibility for train group travel is much wider than for\nflights. In the summer of\n1970 there will be 25 NUSTS\ntrain group destinations. The\n5 new routes are:\nBelgrade \u2014 an additional\ndestination in Yugoslavia and\na convenient point for passengers visiting Rumania\nand Bulgaria.\nBerlin \u2014 of great interest\nin its own right and also very\nconvenient for students en\nroute to Poland.\nRimini \u2014 centre of the\nAdriatic beaches holiday\narea.\nSeville \u2014 a rail destination\nin Southern Spain with the\nchance to see something of\nParis and Madrid en route\n(approx. 4 hours free in\neach).\nStockholm \u2014 the cheapest\nway to visit Sweden a country of particular interest to\nstudents of economics, sociology and design.\nSpecial Note for hitch-hikers: There is now a daily\ntrain service from London to\nany station in Belgium for\n\u00a32 18s. single.\nShipping\nFor students who don't wish to travel with large\ngroups of other students there\nare still facilities available to\ncross the sea at a reduced\nprice \u2014 B&I ferries to Ireland, Hovercraft to France,\nBR/Zeeland to Hook of Holland and Prinz Ferries to\nGermany as well as facilities\nwithin the Mediterranean.\nHolidays\nFor students who have\nonly a few weeks to spare\nand who want their accommodation arranged for them,\nNUS Travel Service has arranged a wide variety of holidays and tours in 21 different\ncountries. Some examples of\nthese are a25 day tour of\nIndia (\u00a3275 fully inclusive),\n15 days in Canet de Mar on\nthe Costa Brava (\u00a337 10s.), a two centre holiday Rome\nand lsch i a( \u00a354 10s.),13 day\ntour of Western Hungary\n(\u00a358 by scheduled flight).\nThese holidays are, of course,\nmuch more student orientated than the normal package\ntours, and there is an added\nincentive to male students\u2014\nthe groups nearly always\nhave more girls than boys !\nan intimate bios co pic experience with\nTHE BEATLES\nAPPLE\nAn ab hCD managed company\npresents\nLetit be\"\nproduced by NEILASPINALL\nDirected by MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\nTECHNICOLOR\u00ae\nUnited Artists\nORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SCORE\nAVAILABLE ON APPLE RECORDS\nWEDNESDAY MAY20 th GALA PREMIERE at 8.00 for 8.45 p.m. LONDON PAVILION< by, nv. tat, on onLy> FROM THURSDAY MAY21 st CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCES "

With the\nrecent disbanding of JURGO, these proposals have become\neven more relevant.\nOver the past few years\nconsiderable efforts have\nbeen made by staff and students to bring into being\nmachinery for ensuring that\nthe students of the College\ncan express their views effectively on the present and\nfuture academic activities of\nthe College.

However,\nin the view of the IC AUT Committee a further level of\ncontact is required, namely\nthat of the students of a particular department and in a particular year; i.e. \"year\nlevel\".\nFirst Reaction\nThe first reaction of many\npeople to such a proposal\nmust certainly be \"Not another batch of commit ees, please!\" And of course it is\nimpossible to prove that\nsu cb committees are either\nnecessary or desirable. It is\na matter of judgement.\nNever the less in the view\nof the IC AUT Committee,\n\"year-level\" committees are,\nexcept perhaps in very small\ndepartments, the most promising way both of increasing the effectiveness of the\nexisting structure and of\nsatisfying better the legitimate demand of the student\nbody for more effective con-sul t ation. The arguments that\nthe IC AUT Committee find\nmost persuasive are as follows :\n(1) Most students in a particular department and\nyear are primarily concerned with the problems of their departmental year group and\nbarely register the existence of departmental\nstaff-student committees.\n(2) The number of staff\nspecifically involved in\nimproving staff-student\nconsultation is too small.\n(3) The departmental staff-student committees have\nto cover a very wide\nfield of activity, viz. all\nundergraduate (and perhaps postgraduate) mat-ter s. They may in most\ncases be successful in resolving the matters that\nare referred to them\n(although this is not\ncertain), but they could\nnot undertake to initiate\nactive staff-student consultation in each year\ngroup since they would\nbe overwhelmed if they\nwere successful. They\nare obliged instead to\nadopt a passive policy\nof dealing with problems\nthat are referred to\nthem.\n(4) If \"year level\" committees existed they could\nactively encourage staff-student consultation at\nthe level that interests\nthe majority of students.\nOperation\nFor clarifying the proposal\nit is desirable to describe the\nway in which a year-level\ncommittee might operate;\nbut the following detailed\nsuggestions are not to be\ntaken as firm rules for all\ndepartments.\nAtypical committee\nwould consist of 3 elected\nstudents from the particular\ndepartmental year group and\n3 staff nominated by the\nstudents from the staff who\nteach their year.\nThe commit ee would:\n(1) Call together the year\ngroup at least once a term and discuss with\nthem what matters\nshould be referred to the\ncommittee.\n(2) Take what action it\ncould to clear up the\nmatters referred to it by\nthe whole group; refer\nto the departmental staff\nstudent committees, any\nmatter where action was\nrequired but where it\nwas not competent to\nact; report back to the\nwhole group once a term.\n(3) Draw up a questionnaire for the student\ngroup on matters affecting the group and the\nstaff who teach the\ngroup.\nThe occasional meetings\nof the year group should be\narranged within College\nhours in order to ensure both\nthat sufficient importance is\nattached to them and that\nsufficient time is available.\nConclusion\nThe IC AUT Committee\nput the present proposal forward for discussion by all\nwho are concerned to improve the effectiveness of\nstaff-student consultation.\nThe proposal is for the creation of staff-student committees at departmental year-level. These committees will\nbe complementary to the\nexisting departmental staff-student commit ees, which,\nalthough capable of im-rove ment, will remain im-port ant. The IC AUT Committee are hopeful that implementation of the proposal\nwill result in more effective\nconsultation between staff\nand students at the \"grass\nroots\" or \"shop floor\" level\nwhere much of the real business of the College takes\nplace; and that any improvement at this level, will have\nimportant and beneficial\nrepercussions at all other\nlevels.\n\n"

C.G.C. members went to\ncollect their new glider.\nDriving a borrowed car and\ntowing a borrowed trailer,\n29ft. long, we covered the\n1,200 mile round trip in four\ndays and four hours.\nAfter collecting all the\nrelevant pieces of paper and\nour shiny new AS K8B glider from Herr Schleicher,\nand being shown round his\nrather splendid factory, we\ndeparted for home. By evening we reached the Germany/\nhim our form and said ' No,\nwe have a form which says\nwe need not pay duty.' He\nsaid we must pay duty. \u00a3133.\nWe laughed. Back in the\nmain building once more we\nsearched for a friendly face,\nand found a Belgian Custom official, and he took us\nto see Le Grand Chef. Fiften minutes later we learned\nhis decision. We must pay\nduty. So we retreated to\nAachen Jugendherbergen\nand slept on it.\nThe next morning we sat\nin the car and counted our\npennies and dollars and\nDeutsche Marks and Belgian\nFrancs and Traveller's cheques. We had \u00a3130 and\nnothing for petrol, so we\nswore. The solution as it\nturned out, was simple. We\nmerely drove out on another\nroad and they let us through.\nEven before we finished\nour breakfast work had begun on rendering the ASK The new ASK Glider 8B Belgium border at Aachen.\nWe confidently showed all\nour papers to the man, who\nsent us inside the large Customs building. Here, another\nman told us to go to Monsieur Bonnie, out the back.\nAnd there we ground to a halt. He looked at our forms,\nincluding the one which excused us import duty into\nBelgium, and said ' You must\npay import duty.' We showed\ntheosophy the ancient occult wisdom\nthrows light\non the meaning\nof life\nEnquiries about\nsource books, library,\nstudy courses, lectures,\nto:\nThe Theosophicai Society,\n50 Gloucester Place,\nLondon,WlH 3HJ The Society is non-sectarian\nwith no obligatory beliefs.\nBranches throughout the\nU.K.8 B airworthy. That this only\ntook us a fortnight is wholly\ndue to the work of Mr. Irving, to whom we become\neven more indebted. He\nclaimed partial reward in the\nform of the first flight, on\n8th March, and the aircraft\nhas been flown at all possible\ntimes since. It has made several flights of over an hour,\nwhich is good so early in the\nyear, and has been taken to\n6.300ft., a gain of 4,500ft. The aircraft is designed as\na local soaring machine, suitable for early solo pilots. It\nhas a low minimum sinking\nspeed and can be flown very\nslowly. This, combined with\nits excellent handling qu ali ties, means that it can stay\nup in the most inexpert hands\nand the weakest of thermals.\nThe greatest advantage,\nhowever, is that it has released our Skylark 4 for the\nmore experienced pilots, and\nalready the Skylark has done\nover 300 kms. cross-country\nthis year, and been to 7,300\nft. in cloud. It has earned\none Silver C distance, to\nShoreham near Brighton.

Icky (pet name)\nsoon proved to be a fast boat,\ncapable of 7 knots off the\nwind and remaining well balanced under any arrangement of sails. She can be\nhandled by two crew on deck\nin all-weather conditions.\nSpring (?) Cleaning\nLate in February, Sandy,\nPete and Henry took the\nsails and navigational equipment to the boat and sailed\nher to the Folly Inn slip way to be scrubbed. While we\nwaited for the double high\ntide to go out and leave\nIcky standing high and dry\nwe fortified ourselves with\nPersian curry and Guinnesses. 10.30! Armed with\ntorches, brooms and buckets\nwe removed a centimetre of\ngrey slime and four barnacles from the Icky bottom.\nAt 2.30 a.m. with the rising\ntide lapping round our\nankles we climbed aboard\nand slept till 5.00 a.m. by\nwhen the whole boat was\ncovered in snow and h oar frost and the river in (thin)\npack-ice. So . . . we decided\nto go for a sail round the\nSolent. Near Fawley we\nsighted another boat: ' What\non earth are you doing out\nKaren Gott and Geoff Cooper tripping the light fantastic\nat this time of year?' hailed\nwe, ' We're mad, what about\nyou? ' ' We're just students;\nhave a Guinness! ' and we\npassed two bottles across.\nThe snow had all suddenly\nslid off into someone's oil-skins so we sailed home and\nmoored Icky opposite the\nFolly Inn in readiness for the\nnext weekend and Easter\ncruises.\nEaster Cruises\nEngland\nMessrs.

    "content": "Stale News IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 291 14th MAY, 1970\nEdition\nStudent Representation\non Board of Studies\nFurther consideration having been given to the question of student\nrepresentation on the Board of Studies, the Board decided at a special\nmeeting on 22 April to invite the Imperial College Union to send five\nstudent representatives, namely the President, the Imperial College\nUnion Academic Affairs Officer and the Academic Affairs Officers of\nthe three constituent College Unions, to future meetings of the Board.\nN.U.S. Wins Student\nGrant Increase\nThe first ever interim student grant increase has been\nawarded by the Government, to take effect from September\n1st this year. The increase will be as follows:\u2014\nFor students living at home from \u00a3290 to \u00a3305.\nFor resident students at London, Oxford and Cambridge\nfrom \u00a3395 to \u00a3420.\nFor resident students at other universities from \u00a3360 to\n\u00a3380.\nFor resident students at colleges of education from \u00a3163\nto \u00a3170.\nAn announcement on postgraduate awards can be expected\nshortly. In addition the Government has agreed to negotiate\nwith the NUS a major review of grants, the resulting increases\nto take effect from September 1971.\nT.U.C. SUPPORT\nThe announcement follows months of work by the NUS behind the scenes to mobil is e support for the claim. The\nTUC, after talks with the NUS, announced its public support\nfor the student's claim, in March. The help of the other educational unions was enlisted. MPs were canvassed personally\nand NUS wrote to 50 MPs individually urging the case for\na grant increase and asking the MP personally to take the\nmatter up with Mr Short, many did. Detailed costings were\npresented to the DES, special press briefings were sent out\nand the NUS delegation saw Mr Short, Secretary of State for\nEducation and Science, and Mr Gerry Fowler, Minister of\nState for Higher Education, on the 4th February.\nThe last time grants were increased was in 1968, when the\nrecommended increase was cut by half as a result of the\nGovernment's devaluation measures.\nTARGETS\nThe next target for NUS action is the major review of\ngrants which the Government has promised for next year, to\ntake effect from September 1971. NUS will be fighting for\ngrant increase to cover the rise in the cost of living since 1968\nand for a major review in the system of grants for students\non non-degree level courses. These students (who include\nmany in Technical Colleges, Colleges of Technology, Art\nSchool and Further Education Colleges on courses up to and\nincluding Higher National Diploma) currently receive grants\nonly at the discretion of their Local Education Authority,\nwhere generosity and lack of it, varies considerably. This\nmeans that whether these students receive a grant, and how\nmuch, depends not on the educational attainment but upon\nthe whims of the Local Education Authority. The NUS conference last April agreed to give the highest priority to the\nreplacement of this system by a mandatory one\u2014the same as\nfor degree level students.\nThe Board also proposes\nto invite to attend its meet-in gs, in due course, a further\nfive students from the Infrastructure Committee arrangements which are to be worked out by the already established joint staff/student\nWorking Party, under the\nchairmanship of Professor\nNeal.\nThe co-opted student representatives will have the\nright to attend all normal\nmeetings of the Board which\nwill not in future discuss\nmatters connected with terms\nand conditions of service of\nacademic staff. The Board\nwill sometimes need to have\na special meeting to receive\nexaminers' reports of examination results and make academic decisions about individual students which flow\ntherefrom; and following\nsuch a meeting, any further\nmeeting involving appeals\nfrom individual students.\nSuch a meeting, or meetings\nwould normally be held in\nthe long vacation, and would\ndeal only with these matters.\nStudents would not attend\nmeetings of this type.\nELSEWHERE\nIN FELIX\nReports on the Easter\nRugby, Football and\nHockey tours.\nNew N.U.S. Travel arrangements and fares.\nCaroline Ward-Bailey discusses Associated studies\nin I.C.

Ltd. can\nbe maintained as a graduates\nplus research factory for\ngovernment and industry.\nThe policy is divide and\nrule, so much is obvious, but\nthe means to overcome this\nresistance to a' comprehensive critical co-adult participatory academic community'\n(courtesy Chairman P.C.) is\nnot so clear.\nIt is all tied up with the\nRector's insistence on the\npresent channels of communication (and the support\ngiven him by Heads of Departments). After all just\nwho do they represent? Their\nposition of power is brought\ninto question by the idea of\na community. The logic behind the Rector saying that\ndictatorship is better than\ndemocracy at I.C. is deep\nrooted. After all you cannot\nhave members of a department deciding its policy; they\nmight dislike the carefully\nhidden defence contracts or\nthe mysterious private firms\nrun in college time, with college equipment, using college\npersonnel to make monies\nfor select individuals.\nOur god of B.o.G.( Lord\nSherfield) stated that trade\nand finance was above poli-tics; although the actions of\nhis fellow industrialists,\nfighting so hard for a conservative government and\nsuppression of the trade un-ions, would appear 'strange-ly ' at odds with this state-ment. In a similar vein some\nI.C. students protest that\nthere is too much external\npolitics in Union meetings,\nas though politics could be\n' external,' politics is the\nlink, the perspective. Most\ndecisions of the Union are\npolitically based. Diversification involves taking a stand on the role of I.C. and\nscience in society, not just arranging courses.\nAnyway people, the year\nof the great leap ends \u2014 and\nthe question of whether sate-lites will ever sing the\nthoughts of Rector Piers remains unasked.\nA tremendous amount has\nbeen achieved this year and a tremendous number of events\nhave occurred. The Autumn\nTerm \u2014 \" the term of the\nabstract nouns \" \u2014 was initially dominated by policy for-mul ation/ formalization and\nthe setting of a direction for\nthe Union. Later students became more involved in events\nas the events related to or\narising from the policies took\nplace. The Autumn term began the lodgings crisis \u2014 a' sleep in' \u2014 on the first day\nof term, our initiative on this\nmade the national press.\nOver the summer we had\nbeen granted observer status\non the Governing Body and\nrejected by the Board of\nStudies (BoSt), so on October\n16 we increased our demands\nand pressed again for representation on the BoSt and\nnow you can SEE anything you want Mat...

'The\nSenate House Beating' of\nRichard Saville brought the\nAfrica into the open. Formissues of Rhodesia and South\naliz ation of Union policy on\nDiversification set an important signpost. The (Nov. 13)\ndecision to join NUS was a great landmark in the political development of I.C. The\n(Nov. 17) distribution of\nBoSt secret minutes shocked\na great many students and\nstaff into the realisation that\n' all is not lovely up there'\nand convinced people of the\nnecessity of a stronger ap-p roach. So, on November 27\nthe Queen's Visit was used\nto produce a pamphlet which\nwas very widely publicised\nin the national press. All this\nactivity polarized student opinions and not unexpectedly\ncaused some ' backlash'\nagainst me, which was fortunately squashed by aMo tion of Confidence at the\nlast 8thUG M of the term\n(Dec. 9).\nThe Spring Term \u2014 ' the\nterm of action' \u2014 saw some\nreally incredible (for IC) developments in attitude and\nconsciousness (bump h+ Union meetings did their trick!)\nOver Christmas a Sabbatical\nyear for the President was\nsuccessfully negotiated \u2014 a very important step to establish a strong Union. So was\nNUS finance and a higher\nsalary for the Union Clerk\n(who typed all bump h). The\ndecision to allow USK to use\nthe swimming pool was a victory after a long battle\nagainst College bureaucrats\nand backward attitudes remaining among some stu-dents. (NB. I.C.U. would\nprobably have opposed such\nusage 2 years ago). The 4\nmain issues of the term were\nArchitectural Association,\nRefectories, Board of Studies Representation and\nICRC. Right from the start\nof the term it was known that\n' all was not well with the\nA A negotiations.' The Union had obtained representation on some of the A A/ IC discussions after the ' blackmail \u2014 embarrassment'\npolitics of pamphlet ing when\nthe Queen visited on Nov.\n27. People were in a state of\ncrystal gazing over the A A and BoSt and were jogged\ninto life by an historic \u2014 and\ndoubly successful \u2014 refectory boycott on January 20,\nwhich hit the national press\n(and soon the idea spread to\nother London Colleges). On\nJan. 22 direct action was\ntaken for the second time in\na week when an A A/ IC special committee meeting\nwas peacefully disrupted by\n1.C. students. On February\n2, I.C. Governing Body unilaterally terminated A A/ IC negotiations over student\nrepresentation and on Feb.\n10 ICU organized the historic\n' Moratorium' which was\nwell covered in the National\nand local press and gave\nNUS a strong hand in negotiations with DES.\nAs a result of good policies\nand groundwork since the\nAutumn term, ICU played\nan important and essential\npart in the London Region\nHousing Conference; and\nalso in the presentation of\nstatements of Quinquennial\ndevelopment policy to the\nUGC and of Higher Education policy to the DES.\nOn Feb. 19 the tedious\nBoSt will they/won't they?\n' decision to decide' resulted\nin a serious discussion for a sit-in. That Union meeting\nincidentally, although deciding on very little, marked a watershed for ICU in that\nthere was clear, well-ex-pressed, constructive and\nlong discussions on some-thing.\nAn awareness campaign\nthen manifested itself. On\nMar. 5 there was a Utile discussion about files and more\ndiscussion of unrest (e spec i ally about non-recognition\nof the ICRC) and the Rector\ncame before the Union for\nquestioning and criticism for\n1^ hours. The term was rounded off with an exciting election campaign in which the\n' middle ' candidate for the\npresidency was squeezed out;\nthis was very significant because a small centre grouping is indicative of (com-par at iv ely) intense political\nstruggle and discussion going\non within the general student\nbody.\nThe Summer term \u2014probably ' the term of consolidation and planning' is seeing\nsome more achievements.\nThe main issues at the beginning were: B.O. S.T. rep-resent ation, Deans and\nHeads of Dept. represent a tion, I.C.R.C., Cleaners\nspeedup, and an important\noutside issue \u2014 victim is ation at Liverpool, etc. On Wednesday, 22 April, 6 Union\nrepresentatives were ' interrogated ' by the B.O. S.T. for\n11 hours. The B.O. S.T. acceded to the Union proposition and gave more than was\nasked for (a verbal one was\nput for more). This was an\nimportant victory for embarrassment persuasion politics.\nOn May Day some I.C. students ' took power over their\nenvironment' and painted a zebra crossing in Exhibition\nRoad. The Sec-Elect of\nN.U.S. addressed a small\nrally at Queen's Tower\n(about Liverpool victim is at ions, etc.) and I.C. students\nsubsequently distributed\n1,500 leaflets to the public in\nS. Ken.\nThe rest of the term will\nbe followed by a long vac\nall set for more next year. \u2022\n\n"

Any I.C. student\nwishing ito diversify could\ndo worse than cast his eye\nin the direction of this new\n\"Paladin\" range. From the\ncatholic selection of titles I culled a few attractive\nblooms.\nHomo Ludens, by Johan\nHuizinga, is described by a more knowledgeable critic\nthan I, as ' the most important work in the philosophy\nof history in our century'.\nFollowing a discussion of\nwhat play is, the learned\nscholar proceeds to demonstrate just how deeply \" culture \" (e.g., law, war, poetry,\nmusic, philosophy, art, international relations, etc.) is\naffected by the need to play.\nThe pursuit of the Millenium, by Norman Cohn, is\na beautiful book, and it gave\nme the rare feeling of reading some first class non-fiction. His study of the\nrevolts of the urban masses\nin the Middle Ages, how\nthey took the Biblical\nApocalypse and set about\nsearching for and destroying\nthe Anti-Christ, in the clergy\nand among the Jews. Of how\nthe established church, almost submerged, had to\nquash these revolts. Cohn\nweaves his way through the\nintricate variations in this\ntheme in a remarkably readable manner. He tells of the\ntouching faith of the Flagellants, Brethren of the Free\nSpirit, the Ropheta and the\nPaupres, Whose faiths were\ndistorted by messianic leaders who invariably regarded themselves as at\nleast equal to Christ or God.\nI opened Bomb Culture,\nattracted by the author, Jeff\nNuttan, who is no mean\npoet, but was sadly di sap pointed.

Tracks like \" Fill My Eyes \" and \" Maybe You're\nRight\" depict a writing\nability never revealed in his\nchart days.\nI would guess that one of\nhis biggest recent influences\nhas been Donovan\u2014the\nsession musicians Cat uses\nback up his style. One of the\nworse tracks, \" PopStar \" is\ndeliberately meant to be\nbad in order to illustrate the\npoint about his top ten days,\nbut most of Cat's writing\nand Paul Samwell-Smith's production make a complementary team for today's selective muSic world.\nACROSS\n1.

They have made few\nappearances in London and\nso may not have the reputation to back up this record.\nAll the same it is a pleasing sound and the group\nseems closely interwoven\nmusically. Jessica StanleyClarke, the only female,\nplays the flute with feeling\nand Leary Hasson on organ\nand Mike Fouracre (a truly\nSomerset name) on percussion reinforce one another notably on \" Ab Initio\nAd Finem \"\u2014a miniature\nopera.\nMy main criticism is'that\nthe vocals\u2014sometimes sung\nand sometimes spoken\u2014tend\nto clog instrumental ability.\nThey are a group that\nbadly need bringing to the\npublic eye, but whether this\nrecord is aired enough is\nanother question.\n* * *\n11.

Called \" FILL YOUR HEAD WITH ROCK\"( SPR 39/40) it contains\ntracks by many of their\nartists, but judging by the\nnumber they house, they\ncould easily bring out another equally good double\nalbum as well.
