    "content": "THE BRITISH INTERNATIONAL\nOpening times\nThe Show is open on Saturday 22nd to Sunday 30th October, from\n9.30am to 7pm each day, except the\nfinal day when it closes at 5pm. Admission charges\nOn the first public day (22nd October) admission costs \u00a310, after\nthat it is \u00a34.\nHow to get there\nThe NEC is situated about ten miles\nSouth East of Birmingham, next to\nthe M42 motorway, Birmingham\nInternational Station and\nBirmingham International Airport.\nIf going by car you should take the\nMl, the M6 and then follow the\npolice signs. These will direct you\nto the NEC or overflow car parks.\nProbably the easiest and the\nquickest way to the Show is to take\nthe train from Euston direct to\nBirmingham International, which is\nconnected to the NEC by a short\ncovered walkway. Combined\ntravel/admission tickets are available\nfor all days except October 22nd.A saver return costs \u00a320, \u00a314.20 if\nyou have a rail card, and are valid on\nany train at weekends, those leaving\nLondon after 09.30 Monday to\nFriday. A group discount is\navailable, whereby one person\ntravels free for every ten in the\ngroup. A basic admission ticket (\u00a34)\nneeds to be purchased at the door\nby anyone who travels free.\nThe journey time is about 1 hour\n20 minutes and trains depart at the\nfollowing times from London\nEuston:\nMonday-Friday\n0710, 0740, 0810, 0835, 0840, 0910,\n0935, 1010 and then half hourly.\nSaturday\n0740, 0835, 0935, 0940, 1010, 1040\nand then hourly.\nSunday\n0800, 0935, 0940, 1040, 1200 and\nthen frequently.\nTrains return from Birmingham\nInternational at:\nMonday-Friday\n1228, 1258 then half hourly.\nSaturday\n1258, 1328, 14 28, 1458, 1558 and\nthen hourly.\nSunday\n1331, 1415, 1431, 1503, 1609, 1630,\n1659,1728, 1754, 1758 and then half\nhourly.\nUp to four seats can be reserved on\nany train for \u00a3 1 and is highly\nrecommended.\n'iz^nz nn n in m ninEr i Sunday afternoon at 2.30pm sees\nthe Grand Final of the Ford\nMotorsport Quiz, taking place in the\nFord Dome just outside the main\nentrance. There is an Imperial\nCollege connection with this event,\nfor taking part as the South-East\nArea Champions are a team from\nCity and Guilds College Motor\nClub. As a joint venture with Mech.\nEng. Soc, C&GC MC are running a coach trip to the Motor Show this\nSunday (23rd). Leaving Beit Arch at\n) am and returning from the NEC\nat 7 pm, this gives plenty of time to\nsee most of the show and support\nthe IC students in the final. Cost is\n\u00a36 for the coach (with a \u00a3 2 subsidy\nfor M.E. Soc or MC members), and\n\u00a34 admission to the show. This\ncompares very favourably with the\n\u00a3 2 0 British Rail combined\ntravel/admission tickets. Anyone\ninterested should come to the\nGuilds office this lunchtime.\nThe British International Motor Show is the in dusty' s chance to impress the public. FELIX sent Adrian Bourne\nalong for a preview...\n\"The World's Greatest Motor Show'\nis how the Society of Motor\nManufacturers and Traders (SMMT)\ndescribe their latest biennial\nextravaganza which opens\ntomorrow at the National Exhibition\nCentre. They may well be right. The\nlack of restrictions on the height and\nstyle of stands that is present at\nsome continental gatherings-means\nthat this is a truly remarkable show,\neven if the Cars that you and I might\nbe able to soon afford are, for the\nmost part, rather turgid.\nStar of the show without, a doubt\nis.the Jaguar XJ220 (Stand 306), a stunning prototype sports car\ndesign exercise. Powered by a6.2 litre, 48 valve V12 engine derived\nfrom the World Sportscar\nChampion winning XJR9, the car is\ndesigned to accelerate to lOOm ph in\neight seconds and go on to a top\nspeed of over 200mph. The whole\nproject will now be handed over to\nthe joint Jaguar/Tom Walkinshaw\nRacing Jaguarsport company for\npossible production in small\nquantities in the early 1990's. If the Jaguar is ever produced then\nit is likely to take the title of the\nworld's fastest production car,\ncurrently held by the Ferrari F40.\nThe last new Ferrari built before the\ndeath of company founder Enzo\nFerrari in August, it was produced\nin limited numbers as a celebration\nof 40 years of car production by the\nfamous Italian marque. Two\nexamples of the car are at the show,\non the neighbouring Ferrari and\nPininfarina (the Italian design\nstudios) stands (304 and 303). The\ntwin-turbocharged 3 litre engine\npumps out 480 bhp and propels the\ncar to a maximum 20.1.3mph. To\nhandle that sort of power requires\na very special chassis,.and the F40\nfeatures a steel tube and composite\ncarbon fibre/Kevlar construction,\nsimilar to that used in Formula One\ncars. Full racing seats and harnesses\ncomplete the car's extremely serious\nappearance. And the price? Well,\nthey sold out virtually before it was\nannounced (Ferrari Grand Prix\ndriver Gerhard Berger is still waiting\nfor his), but if you scour the adverts\nin Autosport/Autocar + Motor/Car\netc you might find one for a cool half\nmillion or so...\nSuccess in motor sport is an\nimportant theme to many of the\nstands, with many manufacturers\nshowing off their World, European\nor British Championship winning\ncars. The dominant McClarenHonda Grand Prix team have one of\ntheir cars on display on the Honda\nStand (220), where Terry Wogan\nwill be interviewing World\nChampionship leader Alain Prost.\nWorld Rally Champions Lancia\n(Stand 223) have a Delta Integrate of\nchampion Miki Biasion, complete\nwith bodywork damage sustained\noo T1 \u20225\n,C5\not J COt J. a oo\np TO \"\nTO\nao3 On\nHalls\n1,2,3 Cars\n4 Cars, Light Commercials\n5 Commercials, Trailers\n6,7 Accessories\non the Safari Rally. Jaguar have the\nLe Mans 24hr winning XJR9 and\nMotorola (Stand 101) have a Benetton B188, the class of the 3.5\nlitre cars in this years GP's.( Motorola manufacture the car to\npits radio system.) Ford (Stand 102)\nalso have a Benetton Fl car, but this\nis one of last year's B187's which\nused the V6 turbo engine. Joining\nthis is the Kaliber Ford Sierra RS500\nCosworth of Andy Rouse, which\nwon eight rounds of the British\nTouring Car Championship, but\ndue to the scoring system lost the\noverall title to the class B BMW M3\nof Frank Sytner. No prizes for\nguessing what appears on the BMW\nstand (221). Peugeot have several of\ntheir 205/405 \"Grand Raid\" type\nrally cars at the show.\nThere is a fair selection of cars\nmaking their British debuts at the\nshow, although none of them are\nparticularly outstanding. The most\npublicised launch is that of the new\nVauxhall Cavalier (Stand 310), with\nthe Ford Sierra its very obvious\ntarget. Personally Ip refered the \"car\nof the future\" from the adverts,\nwhich is also on display. Renault\n(Stand 317) have their new 19\nmodel, although this will not be\navailable in Britain until next spring.\nThey also unveiled the 3.5 litre\natmospheric engine that will power\nthe Canon-Williams Formula One\ncar next year. Another 3.5 litre\nracing engine was on display at Alfa\nRomeo (Stand 401), this time in the\nback of a164 Procar.' This is the new\nsilhouette formula that motor'sport^s governing body hopes to introduce\nin 1990, although Alfa are the only\nmanufacturers to show any interest\nso far. The car has the same profile\nor silhouette as the new 164, but\nunderneath is a pure racer, clocked\nat 210mph on the straight at Monza\nrecently. The road going164's are\nonly a little less impressive,\nalthough one would have thought\nthat with a car with so much\nelectronics on board that they would\nturn them on. Having a fully\nelectrically adjustable seat etc is\npretty useless unless the car has the\nIbattery connected. The new Aston\nMartin Virage (Stand 323) is a replacement for the V8, and will\nhave a similar price tag. The car\nlooks alright, but the name is awful.\nPorsche have one of their 959\nsupercars on a rotating platform up\nin the air on stand 319, presumably\nto stop plebs like you and me\ntouching it or even seeing it in any\ngreat detail. Or perhaps it doesn't feel quite so super in the pre sc en ce of the Jag...\nThe two major British car\nmanufacturers, Ford and Austin\nRover (or the Rover Group, or\nwhatever they're called this week)\nhave probably the largest stands at\nthe show, and probably the most\nboring. First prize for bad taste,\nhowever, must go to AR for the\nbright yellow Metro with the white\nwheel trims. Make sure you visit\nstand 207 before you have your\nlunch.\nA lot of the stands are very\nentertaining, and very gimmicky.\nThe audio-visual technology of the\nbest is probably more hi-tech than\nthe East European cars. Mazda\n(Stand 108) have a multi screen\ndisplay linked to a cutaway four\nwheel steering 626 while Fiat (Stand\n125) have a Tipo on a giant pogo-stick. Mercedes persist with their\nexploding air-bags and there are\ncutaway cars, engines, gearboxes by\nthe dozen.\nAs well as cars there are two halls\nof commercial vehicles, and three of\naccessories, including tools, alarms\nand stereos. Worth checking out\nhere is the Peugeot 309 on the\nPioneer stand (212). Their top of the\nrange boot-mounted CD player/amplifier driving a multi speaker system is very\nimpressive. The 300W super woofer on the back shelf is rather loud...\nThere is so much on offer at the\nshow that it would be impossible to\nmention it all here. The best advice\nI can give to anyone even remotely\ninterested is to give yourself a day\noff work and go along. But be\nprepared for thousands of others\ndoing the same thing.\nPage 10 FELIX October 21 1988 Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Overseas students at risk The planned introduction of the Poll Tax or Community Charge in 1990 is a cause for concern\nfor overseas students. Aside from the financial implications there are fears that the PoH Tax\nregistry, which is publicly available, may be used as a reference book by those groups who\nlike to indulge in racial h arras s ment. FELIX Postgraduate Correspondent, Youssef Samrout !o ok s into the matter.\nFelix\nA bore writes\nDear Bill,\nI am replying to Clare Crippen's criticisms of\nthe new style of Union Cards in last week's FELIX.\nRegarding last year's cards, I have yet to find\na resident of a Hall of residence who found that\nthe system worked in practise. The issuing of the\ncards themselves, with different coloured backs,\nwas an administrative nightmare. As a resident\nof Beit Hall last year, I was not challenged once\nby a security guard to produce my Union card\nwithin the Hall, let alone have the right coloured\nback on it. (Whether the security guard knew\nwhat colour back the card was supposed to have\nis another matter!)\nIt was for these reasons that I decided to change\nthe format for this year. In my opinion, the Union\ncard should not only be one's identification but\ncould also serve another useful function\u2014so I decided to expand the telephone numbers\nsection. If Miss Crippen does not think that she\nwill need any of those telephone numbers at any\ntime this year, I suggest that she thinks again.\nSeveral students have commented that the\ntelephone numbers section is an excellent idea;\nI can't please everybody.\nYowrs Sincerely,\nCharles Brereton, ICU Deputy President.\nAll's well...\nDear Bill,\nI apologise unreservedly to all Wellsoc\nmembers for the absence of Eric Laithwaite at the\nWellsoc meeting on Monday. Circumstances\nbeyond Professor Laithwaite's control meant that,\nsadly, he had to withdraw from giving his\npresidential address. He has, however, expressed\nhis hope that he will be able to talk later this term.\nI am sorry for all inconvenience and\ndisappointment caused.\nOn a brighter note, the Aetherius Society was\nable to step in and give us a lively and\ncontroversial talk about flying saucers!\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Smith, Wellsoc Chairman.\nA token silly\nletter\nDear Bill,\nDo you need any silly letters?\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Daglish, Penthouse Club.\nStudents who think they may be subject to\nphysical attack will be able to ask for their names\nand addresses to be taken off the public register\nfor the poll tax. There are still fears, however, that\noverseas students may suffer h arras s ment unless\nmore protection is built into the legislation. Draft\nregulations governing the implementation of the\npoll tax, which operates in Scotland from April\nand in England and Wales a year later, made the\nconcession that anyone who felt they were\nvulnerable to physical violence or h arras s ment could ask for a 'special entry' so that their name\nand address could be kept private. But the actual\nregulations have dropped the word 'h arras s ment' because it was felt this was too difficult to define.\nUniversity and college authorities and students'\nunions fear this may leave overseas students, in\nparticular, in some danger.\nBoth the Vice-Chancellors' Committee and the\nPolytechnic Director's Committee, which have\nbeen discussing the regulations with the\nDepartment of Environment, called on the\nForeign Office to support their case concerning\noverseas students. A Vice-Chancellors\nspokesman said 'this is a serious problem. Some\noverseas students who come here are persona-non quota in their own country. Some embassies\nhave used means to try to find out who and\nwhere they are\". According to the National\nUnion of Students in Scotland; 'Many overseas\nstudents are subject to surveillance by their home\ngovernment or opposition groups.\nIn recent times many Irani and Iraqi students\nhave had to use adopted names; even the\nWelcome to what will be a regular column to let\nyou know what RCSU is doing around the\nCollege.\nSo far Rag is going quite well. We managed to\nraise just over \u00a31000 on Tiddlywinks as well as\nhaving the top collector in Robert Harwood of\nLife Sciences 2. Last Saturday, October 15, RCSU\nwent out to collect for Mencap, despite the poor\nturnout we still raised \u00a3483.\nThe Spanner and Bolt treasure hunt is going\naccording to plan. The Guilds Exec entering into\nthe spirit of things well. So far they have raised\nmoney on their pub crawl, showing people their\nknees, busking and running a coffee machine in\nthe JCR. This week they have had to collect scrap\nmetal from around College and sell it for scrap.\nTonight they will be carol singing in Leicester\nSquare.\ninstitutions which they attend hold thier real\nnames in strict confidence, using their adopted\nnames in all their affairs. It will be up to the\nregistration officer to decide whether to agree to\nan individuals request to take his or her name\nand address off. The regulations give some\nprotection to women1 who may fear physical\nviolence from a former partner, but there may be\ndifficulties in proving that a threat exists. ViceChancellors told government officials they would\nnot supply names and addresses on a voluntary\nbasis, so the legislation was explicitly amended\nto make them do so. The law says they will only\nhave to provide information 'in their possession\nor control'. So, for example, they will have to\ndivulge names and addresses of people in halls\nof residence and those in private accommodation\nwhere it is known, but they will not have to check\nwhether the information is true, or keep tabs on\nstudents who regularly move.\nColleges will, however, have to give all\nstudents a certificate so the registration officer will\nhave a means of checking whether they are\nentitled to the special concession for full-time\nstudents. Colleges are hoping that current\nstudent forms of identification, such as students'\nunion cards or library tickets, will suffice for poll\ntax purposes. In Scotland the poll tax register will\nbe published this month and it will be the duty\nof everyone to ensure they are on it. Moreover\nfines for failure to register are greater than the\npoll tax payments themselves.\nUnfortunately, the Maths Freshers' Dinner has\nbeen cancelled. All mathematicians can buy\ntickets for next Friday's Life Sciences Dinner from\nDepartmental Representatives and the RCSU\nOffice.\nEnts has been busy; so far organising burgers\nduring Freshers' Week parties, going ice skating\nwith Guilds and a trip to the Laserium (which\nwas unfortunately closed).\nEnts are now looking for acts and offers of help\nfor the Smoking Concert during Rag Week.\nAnything goes, so think of something, even if\nyou are not in RCS.\nFinally, Ents are arranging a trip to the cinema\nthis Monday, to see A Fish Called Wanda, with\nJohn Cleese. The cost will be \u00a32.50 and we are\nmeeting in the Bar at 8pm. RCS Union Blues\nPage 2 FELIX October 21 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nIslam An opinion article by\nIslamic Society.\nLet me begin by clarifying that for\nus Islam is not the name of some\nunique faith presented for the first\ntime by Mohammed. The Quran\nmakes it abu dent ly clear that Islam\nis the one and only faith consistently\nrevealed by God to mankind from\nthe very beginning. Noah,\nAbraham, Moses and Jesus \u2014\nProphets who appeared at different\ntimes and places\u2014all propagated the\nsame faith. They were not the\nfounders of faith to be named after\nIslam is the one and\nonly faith consistently\nrevealed by God to\nmankind\nthem. They were each reiterating\nthe faith of his predecessor.\nWhat distinguishes Mohammed\nfrom other Prophets?\n(i) He was the last Prophet of God,\n(ii) God revived through him the\nsame genuine faith which had been\nconveyed by all the Prophets, (hi)\nthis original message was corrupted,\nand split into various religions by\npeople of different ages, who\nindulged in interpolations and\nadmixture. These alien elements\nwere eliminated by God and Islam,\nin its pure and original form, was\ntransmitted to mankind through\nMohammed, (iv) since there was to\nbe no messenger after Mohammed,\nthe Book revealed to him was\npreserved word for word so that it\nshould be a source of guidance for\nall times, (v) the life of Mohammed\nand the manner in which he\nconducted himself, was also\nrecorded in a unique manner by his\ncompanions and by later compilers\nof the Tradition. A more complete\nWe believe in all the\nProphets who\npreceded Mohammed\nand authentic account of life, saying\nand actions of any Prophet or\nhistorical personage has never been\ncompiled, (vi) in this, way, the\nQuran and the authentic Sunnah of\nthe Prophet together became a reliable source of knowing what is\nIslam, what it stands for, what\nguidance it provides, and what\nobligation it places on us.\nAs Muslims, we believe in all the\nProphets who preceded Mohammed\u2014not only those who are\nmentioned in the Quran, but also\nthose who are not so mentioned\u2014\nand this is such an integral part of\nour faith that if we were to abandon\nit we should cease to be Muslims.\nBut for instruction we turn to\nPhrophet Mohammed alone not on\naccount of any prejudice, but\nbecause as the last of God's prophets he brought us the latest\ndivine dispensation, the word of\nGod which reached us through\nMohammed is pure divine\nlanguage, free of human\nadmixtures, and preserved in its\noriginal form.\nAs I have said earlier, we have a complete historical record of the life,\ncharacter, conduct, sayings and\nactions of the Prophet Mohammed,\npreserved with meticulous care,\naccuracy and detail. Since this\ncannot be said of other Prophets we\ncan believe in them, but we cannot\nemulate them.\nIt is our belief that Mohammed's mission was for the world as a whole and for all times; for, (i) its\nuniversality has been clearly\nconfirmed by the Quran, (ii) it is a logical consequence of the finality of\nhis prophethood. A Prophet, after\nwhom there was to be no other, had\nto be guide and leader for all men\nand for all ages, (iii) God has\nprovided through him a complete\ncode which man needs to follow the\nright path and this in itself supports\nthe concept of finality, because\nwithout completeness, the need for\nother Prophets would remain, (iv)\nit is a fact that during the last 1400\nyears no man has arisen whose life\nand work bears even the slightest\nresemblance to that of a Prophet.\nNor has anyone presented a book\nwhich could be remotely considered\nas divine communication. Still less\nhas there been a man to claim\nlegitimate authority as a law-giver\nfor mankind.\nIt must, at this point, be\nunderstood why the need arose for.\nGod to communicate with man\nthrough His Prophets. This has to\nbe examined in the context of the\nsources of human knowledge. At\nthe preliminary stage we gain\nknowledge through empirical\nobservation. At higher level comes\ndeductive reasoning accompanied\nby scientific investigation. Man is\nsufficiently well equipped in these\nfields not to require direct divine\nassistance. Though, no doubt, there\nThe Prophet\ndetermines the rules\nwhich should form\nthe basis of social and\ncultural relationships\nis an ever present divine will\nhelping man in his research and\ninnovative endeavours and\nrevealing to him progressively the\nmysteries of His creation. Some\ngifted individuals achieve, in\nmoments of rare inspiration, new\ninsights or discover new laws of\nnature. But there is another type of\nknowledge which is beyond the\nreach of our senses of scientific\nstudy. This sphere of knowledge\ndoes not submit to any instrument\nof scientific examination.\nPhilosophy and science can only\nspeculate about it. Human theories\nabout ultimate realities, based on\nreason, never achieve the level of\ncertainty, and their authors,\nconscious of their limitations, do not\npresent them as conclusively\nproved. In respect of these realities\nman is dependent on whatever\nknowledge is communicated to him\nby God. How is this knowledge\nconveyed? Not through the\noperations of some publishing\nhouse, where books are printed and\nhanded over to each man, with\ninstructions to read them, and to\ndiscover the truth about himself,\nabout the universe and about the\nmanner in which he should organise\nhis life. To convey this knowledge\nto mankind God chooses Prophets\nas His messengers. He reveals the\ntruth to them and they\ncommunicate it to the people.\nThe work of a Prophet is not\nlimited to communication of\nknowledge alone. He has to explain,\naccording to what is revealed to\nhim, the relationship between God\nand man and man and man as it\nfactually is, and as it actually should\nbe. \"\nThe next part of\nthis article will\nappear in the next\nissue\nThoughts for the week\nFrom Tebbit's new book Upwardly\nMobile\nOOn Michael Foot\u2014'A fascist at\nheart'\u2014what does this make Tebbit?\n*On unemployment\u2014'It took me three\nmonths to find someone who would\nrepair the gate in my garden in a country with three million unemployed'\n\u2022 On epita th s \u2014'Here lies my wife:\nhere let her lie!

My name is Dave Clements,\nand I'm an Astrophysicist, to be\nfound at the top of the Physics\ndepartment, or on internal phone\nnumber 6681. Quite a few things are\nhappening in the PG world at IC,\nand this occasional column is\nintended to keep you all informed.\nFirst the good news, A large\ngathering, to which all PGs are\ninvited, is being planned. Food and\ndrink (alcoholic or not) will be\nprovided, and various College and\nUnion people will be attending. The\nidea is to introduce the PGs, so often\nleft out in the cold, to all these\npeople, and to allow us to\ncommunicate any problems we\nmight be having to the men at the\ntop, so that something can be done\nabout it. Details of the event will be\narriving through your pigeonholes\nsoon, and FELIX will be carrying\nmore about it as well.\nNow for something a trifle more\nserious. We all know how difficult\nit is to find accommodation in\nLondon, but new UK PGs from\noutside London have even worse\nproblems. They get no chance to\nstay in an IC run hall or house at all,\nand cannot even get booked in to\nsuch a hall over the summer while\nthey do some flat hunting. I know\nof several PGs who have had\nproblems, and would like to hear\nfrom any others. Foreign students\nwho have fallen through the net and\nhave not had places in IC\naccommodation I would also like to\nhear from. Moves are afoot to do\nsomething about this problem, and\nthe more information we have about\nit the better. Drop me a line in the\nUnion Office (put a note for the\nPGAO c/o IC Union into the internal\nmail) and I 'll see what I can do.

Although it was only a friendly, several 'old hands' knew\nthey would be fighting for their\nplaces in the face of some new\ntalent.\nThe starting line up, however,\nwas much the same as last year with\nHari Vamadevan, the newly\nappointed captain, hoping for a good start to the season. And, what\na start we had. Only twelve seconds\ninto the game, after some sterling\nwork from Max Michaelis, Hari\nscored our first goal of the season.\nAlthough, at times, disjointed, the\nteam in the first half did show some\npromise. To this end they managed\nto score again before half-time.\nHowever, the second half was\ndisappointing, with the team\nstruggling to retain the control it had\ndisplayed in the first half. This could\npossibly be attributed to the halftime substitutes which left several\nplayers out of position.\nENGINEERS, PHYSICISTS AND MATHEMATICIANS\nARE INVITED TO SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH ICI\nEveryone at University has some idea of what they\nneed from their first employer.\nThe problem is where to find the first job that\nmatches your particular needs and ambitions.\nId's three Christmas courses provide an ideal\nopportunity to find out more about a career in\nControl/Electrical, Chemical, Mechanical or Materials\nEngineering.\nAttend our presentation on Monday 31st October at\n6pm in the Sherfield Building Ante Room, where we will\ngive you a taste of what the Christmas Courses involve\nand the careers they describe.\nThe presentation will also be of interest to anyone unable to attend a Christmas Course,\nbut still attracted to a career in ICI, one of the world's most successful international businesses.\nBeer and sandwiches will be provided!\nFOOTBALL\nStrong\ndefence\nGoldsmith'sI \u20140\nImperial College I \u2014\n4\nA storming start to the season was\nmade by the team with a resounding\n4-0 victory against last year's league\nchampions.\nAfter a tentative start IC took\nadvantage of the fluctuating\nweather conditions on the half hour\nwhen Nigel Collier scored the first\ngoal from six yards after some good\nwork from Pip Peel.\nVOLLEYBALL A nervous\nstart\nCentral London Poly\u2014-3\nImperial College\u20141\nThe hope and cheerfulness of a new\nseason quickly evaporated last\nFriday as Imperial were taught what\nwas required in the London second\nIC took the 1-0 lead into the\nsecond half and had to soak up\nsome heavy pressure with\nGoldsmith's forcing several\nremarkable saves from the\notherwise invisible goalkeeper\nSimon Holden. Some stout defence\nfrom Fisher and Dyson kept\nGoldsmith's at bay until on the\nhour. Phil Ewart scored a fortunate\nbreakaway goal to take the result to\nrelative safety.\nFrom then on IC dominated the\nmatch adding two further goals\nfrom a delicate lob from Collier\nwhen Paul Olden put him through,\nand a storming volley from the man-of-the-match Simon Cole.\ndivision into which they were\npromoted in May. In a small, dark\ncourt just off Regents Street, IC gave\none of their patchiest performances\nin recent years to go down by three\nsets to one to an ageing, but well\ndrilled Central side. To be fair, there\nhave been some problems for\nImperial this October: the volleyball\nposts had been vandalised a month\nbefore, combining with a delay in\nrepairs to mean that there was no\ntraining with a net until two days\nbefore this fixture.\nFOOTBALL\nKings College Hospital III\u20140\nImperial College VI\u20142\nIC started their season with a well\nearned victory against a rather lack\nlustre Kings side. IC attacked the\nKings' goal right from the kick off\nand were only thwarted by\ninadequate finishing and some fine\ngoal keeping by the Kings' keeper.\nIC looked like going ahead when,\nafter sustained pressure, a dubious\npenalty was awarded for a hand ball\nby a Kings' defender, but Hideo\nTakano decided to 'back pass' the\nball to the keeper instead of putting\nit in the net and that chance went\ndown the drain. Despite continued\npressure after this anti-climax, the\nKings' defence held out and IC\nnearly went behind from a quick\nbreak by Kings culminating in a20 yard drive acrobatic ally tipped over\nthe bar by Simon Turner, who spent\nmost of the afternoon moaning that\nhe had nothing to do, and would\nrather be anywhere but in goal. IC's deserved goal came just before halftime when they latched onto a through ball from the back to strike\na fine drive past the advancing\nKings' keeper.\nPage 16 FELIX October 21 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Science\nIN THE\nPIPELINE\nby ANDREW HALL\nForests\nunder threat\nThe issue of the destruction of the world's forests has been in the news\na lot recently. Here is a brief attempt to examine the issues and some of\nthe news stories.\nWhy does it matter anyway?\nThere is a growing mass of evidence\nto show that trees provide much\nmore than simply somewhere for\nmonkeys to swing from and birds to\nbuild nests in; they play an\nTL\"1\nrivers flood and\nthen run dry\nimportant part in the environment\nand particularly the regulation of\nwater. For example, forests on high\nground, because of the complex\nnetworks of roots that the trees\nhave, firstly hold together the soil\nand prevent it from being washed\naway and secondly trap water\nduring rainy seasons. Cutting down\nthe trees therefore has two\nimmediate consequences: the soil is\nwashed away and accumulates in\nthe rivers and the delicate regulation\nof the flow of water is upset. In the\nrainy season the rivers flood and\nduring the rest of the year they run\ndry. This is no mere conjecture on\nthe part of environmentalists; the\nrecent floods in Bangladesh,\nalthough caused by exceptional\nrainfall, may have been made worse\nby large-scale deforestation in that\npart of the world. In Panama, the\nvery operation of the Panama Canal\nis treat e ned since the canal is above\nsea level and requires a constant\ninput of water. Due to destruction\nof about 40% of Panama's forests,\nthe canal has silted up very badly\nand during the dry season there is\na restriction on the size of ships\nwhich can pass through the canal\nbecause of the low water level.\nThere is a very real danger that by\nthe time that the Canal Zone passes\nback to Panama's control (from the\nUSA) the canal will be useless, with\nserious consequences for Panama's economy and world shipping.\nProblems in Bangladesh and\nPanama may be of little concern to\nus in other countries, but there is a further problem which results from\nclearing areas of forests. That is, the\natmospheric pollution: carbon\ndioxide, carbon monoxide 'and\nparticulate carbon which are\nreleased when areas of trees are\nburnt. This could be the cause of\nglobal problems, as we will see later.\nDevelopment of the Amazon\nHardly a week goes by without the\nAmazon forests featuring in the\nnews. Next to the Amazon all other\nforests in the world are tiny\u2014it\ncovers some two million square\nmiles, which is about twenty times\nthe size of Great Britain, a size\nwhich is hard to comprehend.\nClearly it is in Brazil's interest to\ndevelop some of the potential of the\nregion as the country has enormous\nsocial and economic problems.\nThere are demands for hydroelectric\nschemes, agricultural development,\nexploitation of the vast mineral\nresources in the region and building\nof better communications. All too\noften however, plans are carried out\nwithout consideration of the long\nterm environmental consequences.\nThere is no reason to prevent\ndevelopment in the region if it can\nbe carried out with full\nconsideration of the environment,\nas indeed many projects are.\nHowever, it is the few which are not\nthat pose the biggest threat.\nCommunications and\nAgriculture\nSlowly Brazil is improving its\ninternal communications with\nschemes such as the Trans-Amazon\nHighway. These communications\nprovide easy access to what was\npreviously inaccessible forest. Most\nof Brazil's agriculture and industry\nis concentrated in the temperate\nsouth of the country in the Rio-Sao\nPaolo area where coffee, sugar,\nfruit, rubber, etc. are produced,\nmainly for export to pay for Brazil's massive overseas debts. The new\nhighways allow people to penetrate\ndeep into the Amazon forests to\nstart a new life. They start by cutting\ndown and burning trees in an area\nto produce land to grow crops and\nkeep livestock, a method of clearing\nand preparing land as old as the\nSouth American Indian tribes. The\npractice is beginning to get out of\nThe forests under threat...\nhand with nearly 5000 daily fires\nbetween July and October, causing\nthe burning of some 80,000 square\nmiles of the Amazon forests in 1987\n(estimated from weather satellites\nby the Sao Paolo Institute for Space\nResearch). Unfortunately, the land\nis not as fertile as the dense forests\nThey start by cutting\ndown and burning\ntrees\nsuggest that it might be\u2014most of the\norganic material is in the trees and\nplants which are burnt and after\nfour or five years the land is\npractically desert. Once families\nhave become established in their\nnew farming lives they have little\noption but to move on to another\narea of the forest and so the\ndestruction continues. What is so\nunfortunate about all this is that\nwith a small amount of organisation\nand investment, the forests could be\nused to much greater economic\nbenefit, without their destruction\nand the creation of vast areas of\ndesert land. After all, about the most\nuneconomic way to use wood is to\nburn it; most of the wood is highly\nsought after hard wood. If it takes\n100 years for a decent-sized\nhardwood tree to grow, then cutting\ndown and re planting every 200th tree in a year should be no problem.\nWhat the forests cannot recover\nfrom is the large scale clearing of\nareas of land. And there may be\nplants with medicinal properties yet\nto be discovered (Quinine was\ndiscovered in the bark of cinchona\ntrees in Bolivia in the 19th century,\nand at that time was the only cure\nfor malaria).\nMinerals\nIt is estimated that Brazil has a quarter of the world's reserves of\niron ore. The richest iron ore\ndeposits in the world are to be\nfound at Gran Carajas, deep in the\nheart of the Amazon region. A project funded by the World Bank\naimed at extracting these reserves is\na model of environmental\nconsideration. A large area of the\nBrazil has a quarter of\nthe world's reserves\nof Iron Ore\nforest in the region is protected and\nthere are controls on replacing forest\nwhich has to be cut down during the\nmining. The plan was for Brazil to\nexport the iron ore, but the powers-that-be in Brazil came up with a 'better' idea. Why not smelt the ore\nPage 6 FELIX October 21 1988\n\n"

    "content": "News\nIC Rent\nStrike?\nA motion calling for the College to\nuse the income generated by taking\non more students to sub sid is e accommodation is to be debated at\nTuesdays Union General Meeting\n(UGM). The motion states that the\nproposal should be taken to\nGoverning Body and unless policy\nis agreed, it calls for a College wide\nrent strike.\nThe motion explains that the\nrevenue generated by taking on\nmore students is approximately\nequal to the extra cost of housing\nthem. At the moment the College\nbenefits from the funds brought in\nby increased student numbers but\nthe bill for the required extra\naccommodation has to be paid for\nby increasing student rents.\nMembers of the College finance\nsection and the Rector have been\ninvited to speak against the motion.\nSources within the Union suggest\nthat an am mend ment calling for the\naccommodation levy to apply to\nOverseas students only is being\nconsidered. Such an amendment, if\ntaken up by the College is likely to\nlead to a reduction in the number of\nOverseas students at IC.\nBR cheap y British Rail have announced that the j price of a Young Persons Railcard\nwill be reduced by \u00a3 5 to \u00a310 from\nnow until November 5 this year.\nThe cards are available to most\nstudents and can give up to a third\noff rail fares.\nFishy\nWishy\nThe Chairman of the Imperial\nCollege Governing Body, Sir Henry\nFisher MA, officially opened Fisher\nHall last Friday. Before unveiling a plaque, Sir Henry made a short\nspeech. When speaking of his\nconcern over the accommodation\nproblem at IC he said 'If we can't house our students and lecturers\nthey can't come.' He added that it\nwas a 'rather pleasant experience'\nto have a hall of residence named\nafter him.\nImperial & Mary's officially merged\nPrincess Anne announced an\naccommodation appeal fund for\nImperial at the cer jem ony to\ncelebrate the merger of IC and St\nMary's Hospital Medical School\n(SMHMS) on Wednesday.\nShe spoke of the need for\nadequate accommodation for\nstudents, particularly for\npostgraduates.\nShe went on to emphasise the\nneed for continuity, saying that\n'traditional strengths would form\nthe backbone' of the merged\ninstitutions, and said that the talent\nin both colleges indicated an exciting\nfuture.\nThe Rector of IC, Professor Eric\nAsh, in his speech expressed delight\nat such an 'exhilarating occasion',\nwhile the Dean of SM HMS, Professor P Richards, referred to the\n'academic excellence, intellectual\nand cultural diversity and the\nhumanity and dedication' that\nwould abound in the new College.\nImperial College Union President\nNigel Baker welcomed the\nChancellor's remarks on\naccommodation. He also said that\nalthough the Students' Unions of IC\nand SMHMS had not yet merged,\nthey were working their problems\nout and that the merger would be\ncomplete by 1 August 1989.\nBeit Hall joins the rent\nrow fr vr tT! Residents in Beit Hall are\nconsidering joining Fisher Hall in a move to withhold the payment of\npart of their Hall bills, the students\nare angry that they were not\ninformed of increased rents\u201412%\ngreater than last year\u2014when they\naccepted places in Beit. They are\nunhappy with the College's decision\nto charge for an extra week's rent\nover the Christmas holidays.\nTwo of the residents pinned a petition up in the Beit Hall Common\nRoom on Monday night, asking for\ncomments on the new rent levels.\nThe petition has been signed by 31\nresidents who estimate 'reasonable'\nrent levels to lie between \u00a330 and\n\u00a335 per week as opposed to the\ncurrent \u00a337 per week.\nAs explained in last week's FELIX,\nthe decision to charge an extra\nweek's rent was taken by the\nStudent Residence Committee in\nJune. According to the College, the\nextra week's rent will mean that the\nstudents will be able to use their\nrooms as storerooms or\naccommodation for the three weeks\nover Christmas. In the past, say the\nresidents, they were allowed to keep\ntheir property in their rooms\nwithout the extra week's charge.\nOne of the petition organisers told\nFELIX, 'If we get more than 50%\nsupport from the residents we will\ngo ahead with providing a standard\nletter which residents can submit\nwith their reduced rent'.\nAmazing\ngive away\nbonanza\nT? ie Times and National Westminster\nBank have both launched\ncompetitions for undergraduates.\nThe Time's is asking for essays on\n'Trial by the media' and 'Is hunger\nfor short-term profitability\ndestroying British Industry?'.

    "content": "Travel\nThe Independent\nTraveller\nIn recent years travel has become accessible to most students, whether\nit is a month's inter railing around Europe or a World tour. This has come\nabout by a unique combination of freely available discount flights, the\nstrength of Western currencies against those of Third World countries and\nthe opening up of many countries after years of isolation. One may\nquestion the state of a world economy that allows a pri vele ged few\nopportunities that many can only dream of. But travellers can make a positive contribution to the countries they visit, not only by spending\nforeign currency but by increasing awareness of the unique culture they\npossess.\nIn recent years travel has become\naccessible to most students, whether\nit is a month's inter railing around\nEurope or a World tour. This has\ncome about by a unique\ncombination of freely available\ndiscount flights, the strength of\nWestern currencies against those of\nThird World countries and the\nopening up of many countries after\nyears of isolation. One may question\nthe state of a world economy that\nallows a pri vele ged few\nopportunities that many can only\ndream of. But travellers can make a positive contribution to the\ncountries they visit, not only by\nspending foreign currency but by\nincreasing awareness of the unique\nculture they possess.\nThe early pioneers of independent\ntravel, a few hardy Ausies who\nover landed from Sydney to\nLondon, laid the trail for increasing\nnumbers of backpacking travellers,\nintent on exploring the most remote\nregions of the world. Although the\nwars in Iran and Afghanistan have\nlimited the classic Asian overland\ntrip, travellers are now regularly\nvisiting six continents, and even\nAntarctica is beginning to be opened\nup by tourist flights from Argentina.\nAs the destinations explored\nexpands, an increasing number of\nguide books aimed at the\nindependent traveller have\nappeared, so if one is planning a trip, a reasonable body of experience\nhas already accumulated on most\ncountries.\nWith the increasing numbers of\nbackpackers travelling to remote\ndestinations, an entire subculture\nhas developed. One can sit in cafes\nwith names like 'Jim's Peace Cafe'\nor 'The Hard Rock Cafe' and munch\nme us li or banana pancakes all over\nSouth East Asia and even China.\nAnd as you consume you decadent\nWestern luxuries, you can listen to\nyour fellow travellers boast of their\nexploits. For some, travelling has\nbecome a competition to see as\nmuch as possible, as cheaply and as\nquickly as their bodies can stand,\nwhile others, the discovery of\n'genuine' experiences are the\nsubject of their boasts. For most\nmere mortals, travelling at one's own pace and gaining an insight\ninto the country they are visiting is\nenough, after all, you are on\nholiday!\nproblem, my advice is carry it in a money belt no matter how safe the\ncountry you are in is. Eurocheques\nare useful in Europe where massive\ncommissions are charged on\ntravellers cheques, whereas in the\nThird World, where commission is\nrarely charged, American Express\nTravellers Cheques are the most\nwidely accepted. A few American\ndollars in cash can also be extremely\nuseful in difficult situations, but in\nsome countries using foreign\ncurrency is illegal, so be careful.\nInsurance\nHighly recommended because\npeople can get very ill out in the\nThird World, and if you are not\ninsured, you can just be left to rot.\nBoth ISIS and Travel Cuts on Regent\nStreet do good deals, but the cost of\ninsurance seems to have risen\nphe nominally in recent years.\nexperience of bucket shops has been\nfavourable, but stories do circulate\nof small operations folding after\npayment of the fare, but before\ntickets are received. These shops\nwill advertise their flights in\nmagazines like LAM and TNT.\nCards\nAs a student there are many cards\nthat can be purchased that will save\nyou money. The ISIC (International\nStudent Identity Card) is generally\naccepted throughout the world,\nalthough in some countries like\nChina, student identity is useless for\ngetting discounts. The Y HA is also\nuseful, because in many parts of the\nworld, Youth Hostels represent the\ni cheapest accommodation available.\nMoney\nCarrying money is always a Health\nHealth is a subject often ignored by\ntravellers, but it is sickness that is\nlikely to ruin your holiday. Public\nhealth in the Third World comes\nnowhere near the standards we\nexpect in the West, and the traveller\ncan become prey to many diseases\njust due to poorly prepared food or\ncontaminated water. Always consult\nyour doctor before you leave about\nwhat injections you should have,\nand it is probably a good idea to\nhave an injection against Hepatitis\nA if you are going anywhere in the\nThird World. Personal hygiene is\nimportant and water should never\nbe drunk from the tap, although\neven bottled water can be suspect\nbecause some racketeers fill empty\nbottles with tap water, re seal it and\nthen resell it. To be safe, drink only\nboiled or sterilised water (although\nthere are side-effects from drinking\nsterilised water long term), or Coca\nCola, which is available\ninternationally. Food is more of a problem, because food can be\nprepared at the beginning of the day\nand kept warm with flies walking all\nover it. It is best to just eat food that\nis cooked quickly at a high\ntemperature, preferably in front of\nyou, but this can be difficult in many\ncountries. Basically, everything\nmust be suspected as a source of\ninfection, you can't just pick up food\noff street sellers and expect it to be\nalright.\n| Over the next few weeks, we are\nplanning to begin a regular travel\ncolumn in FELIX, including features\non particular countries or regions,\nhints on how to organise your\nholiday, reviews of guidebooks and\ntips and rumours as we hear them.\nFeatures or information on any\naspect of travel are welcome. Feel\nfree to write about Bognor or remote\nmonas tries in Tibet. Any interesting\nphotos you have would also be of\ninterest.\nWhere to go\nObviously a question of prime\nimportance, and one which the\nfeatures in subsequent issues will\nhelp you with. Once you have\ndecided your destination, purchase\na good guide book. The books\navailable for a particular destination\nvary enormously, so the best idea is\nbro use the shelves of a good\nbookshop. One highly\nrecommended shop is The Travel\nBookshop, 13 Blenheim Crescent,\nW ll, just off the Portobello Road.\nThere are also two publishing\ncompanies, Lonely Planet and the\nRough Guides, that specialise in\nguides for the independent\ntraveller. In my opinion, the Lonely\nPlanet guides are usually the best,\nalthough they do not cover Europe,\nRussia or the USA and one must\nremember that any guide will never\nbe 100 per cent accurate.\nTransport\nGetting to and from your\ndestination will always represent a large proportion of any budget. In\nEurope, the inter rail ticket still\nrepresents great value for money,\nalthough ? cheap package flight may\nwork out cheaper if you are touring\none country. Outside Europe, flying\nis by far the best way unless you are\nplanning a long overland trip.\nCheap flights are easy to come by\nin London, whether from STA,\nTrailfinders or a bucket shop. Bucket\nshops will usually sell the cheapest\ntickets, but these may involve\nlengthy stopovers and rather\nindirect routes, like via Moscow or\nflying to China via Los Angles.

    "content": "Reviews\nBOOKS Misery\nStephen King\nPaul wakes up to find himself being\norally raped by Annie. Is he\nshocked? Initially, yes, but this\nfeeling subsides as he realises she is\nonly engaged in such an act through\nher affection for him. Lucky man.\nYou may think so, but think again.\nWhy does a car crash in the Rocky\nMountains result in his subjection\nto the kiss of life in this manner,\nbed-ridden in a perfect stranger's house?\nWell it's like this. Paul Sheldon is\na writer and the stranger, Annie\nWilkes is several things, one of\nwhich is Paul's 'biggest fan'.\nAnother is a mass murderess, but\nwe can forgive her for that, it being\nan unfortunate but natural side-effect of being psychotic. Paul is\nunwilling to forgive her though and\ndesperate not to be forced into early\nretirement despite already finding\nhimself in her grisly little scrap\nbook. Annie doesn't want Paul to\nretire either, yet. Oh no, she wants\none more book, exclusively for\nherself. Then she'll help him retire\ncompletely.\nPaul writes two types of books-good ones and popular ones. The\npopular ones recount heroic tales of\nMisery Chastain, a melodramatic\ncharacter in an equally\nmelodramatic nineteenth century\nEngland, and Paul hates them. The\nwriter plays God in a story, He\ngive th and He take th away, and in\nthe latest episode, Misery's Child,\nPaul hath taken away Misery's life\nmuch to his own amusement.\nMuch to Annie's anger too. She\nwants her heroine back and\nproceeds to persuade Paul to\ncomply. Persuasion comes in many\nforms\u2014drugs, an axe, a blowtorch\nand not least of all, sheer brute\nstrength. Annie has them all and\nPaul is about to learn what Misery\nreally means.\nMisery is typical Stephen King.\nThe guts of the book is character\ndevelopment at a primitive level. To\nbe precise, the first half is nothing\nmore. Two characters, one learning\nabout not just the other but about\nhimself also. True to form King tells\nhis quickly captive audience the\nwhole story immediately. We know\nAnnie is crazy on page nine and a psycho soon afterwards, nothing\nless than a large female Norman\nBates in fact. Just as Paul cannot\ncheck out of the Wilkes Motel\nneither can we opt out of the book.\nHidden in the book is a third\ncharacter, King himself, present as\nPaul Sheldon's subconscious mind.\nThe final third or so is largely Paul's thoughts on writing, life, and life as\na writer, and how he is to escape\nAnnie's tyranny and continue them.\nKing reveals what must surely be\nhis own opinions on those subjects\n(Annie excluded). Notably he\ndiscusses 'the gotta' aspect (T gotta\nfinish this chapter before...') which\nseparates popular fiction from good\nfiction. In drawing attention to this\ncharacteristic of best-sellers it seems\nthat, to his own mind at least,\nStephen King's twenty or so novels\nare undoubtedly popular but almost\ncertainly not classics.\n'Not true say I', but what of\nMisery in particular? It develops like\nseveral other King stories and is not\nonly notably similar to The Shining\nbut even references the Overlook\nHotel directly. If you know King's style then the outcome is blindingly\nobvious, though that does not forbid\na few surprises along the way.\nCertainly not. Making the narrative\npredictable in this way destroys\nnothing and, in fact, helps to grasp\nthe reader's attention. You know\nPaul eventually escapes but you\nwant to guess how as early as\npossible and then keep reading to\nsee whether you'd make a good\nHolmes or Poirot.\nThe best King book I 've read is\nstill Salem's Lot, and the newest\nrelease isn't really close, lacking the\nconsiderable depth and tension of\nthe earlier work, 'it's'un put down able' for sure though, well\nendowed with 'gotta' appeal, and\nwhatever else you may find it\ncertainly doesn't provide any\nmisery.\nIt is available now in hardback and\nfrom December in paperback also.\nAndrew Clarke.\nThe Cosmos where did it come from\nThe Omega\nPoint\nJohn Gribbin (Corgi \u00a34.95)\nCosmology is in a state of ferment,\nwhich is reflected in John Gribbin's latest layman's explanation of the\nglamourous side of science. The\nOmega Point refers to the density of\nmass in the universe, omega, which\nassumes a value of unity if the\nuniverse is to expand to a steady\nstate. If omega is greater than this,\nthe universe will, sooner or later,\ncollapse to a 'Big Crunch'. This\neventuality, and evidence to\nsupport it, and the consequences\nmake up the greater part of this\nbook, which is nevertheless very\nreadable, as is all of Gribbin's work.\nThe author has the ability to draw\nsome quite pleasing analogies to\nexplain the theories put forward,\nalthough I am left wondering\nsometimes if they are all\ncomprehensible to someone without\na strong physics background.\nHaving read some of Gribbin's previous work (ie In Search of\nSchrodinger's Cat) seems almost to be\na prerequisite to understanding\nsome sections which draw on\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,\nfor example. As an explanation of\nthe 'hairy mathematics' of\ncosmology, it does not bear\ncomparison with the magnificent,\nbut pricey A Brief History of Time\nby Stephen Hawking, but it covers\na lot more ground at a price more\nsuitable to the man on the Clapham\nOmnibus. Overall, I would say that\nI enjoyed reading this book, and it\nbrought a lot of new and very\ninteresting information to my\nattention. The back cover stipulates,\nhowever, that this is \"The Ultimate\nBook on the Ultimate Topic', which\nonly warrants a dry cough and a whisper of 'I beg your pardon?'.\nVIDEO\nAsterix in\nBritain and the\nNew Adventures\nof Mighty Mouse\n'What on Earth am I doing\nreviewing cartoons?' was the\nquestion I repeatedly asked myself\nas I sat through a double bill that no\ntoddler, let alone College student,\nwould ordinarily sit through.\nFortunately though, there are\nenough insane people out there to\nwarrant such a review. I wondered\nwhether this stuff would be a bit too\nimmature for us sophisticated,\nresponsible, young adults, but I guess there isn't anything that\nwould not appeal to the\nundergraduate mentality.\nI suppose I was justified in\nwanting to see Asterix in Britain,\nsince I enjoyed the comic book so\nmuch. How would the clever jokes\nand wonderful fun-poking at the\nBritish be transferred to screen? The\nanswer is they don't. Although the\nfilm follows the text of the book very\nclosely, the pace of narration is so\nslow, and the voices incomprehensible, that the end product is just\nsoporific dross. The animation is\ngood but the jokes fall flat and the\nwhole is a rather insipid and tedious\naffair (at over 75 mins long).\nThe New Adventures of Mighty\nMouse is a different matter\naltogether I haven't seen the old\nadventures but this series of ten\nminute cartoons are very fast\nmoving and quite funny in places.\nThey certainly woke me up from my\nAsterix induced stupor. The style of\nanimation is refreshingly different\ntoo. I doubt any of you will go out\nand get a Mighty Mouse video, but\nif you come across it, and need some\ncheering up, why not give it a try?\nI don't believe I said that!\nSumit Guha.\nOctober 21 1988 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

    "content": "THE -a.... ER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nIC SET TO MERGE WITH RHBNC?\nTalks begin on\nfurther mergers\nImperial College and Royal\nHolloway and Bedford New College\n(RHBNC) in Egham have begun\ntalks on a possible merger.\nIncreasing pressures on\naccommodation at Imperial coupled\nwith financial problems at RHBNC\nhas led to speculation \u2022 that the\nmerger is likely to receive the go\nahead.\nA working party has been set up\nto examine the feasibility of such a move. The party is represented at IC\nby professor Patrick Dowling, Head\nof Civil Engineering and Professor\nRoy Anderson, Head of the\nDepartment of Pure and Applied\nBiology.\nIt has been described by the\nRector, Professor Eric Ash, as 'a small committee with the limited\ntask of advising either college\nwhether it is worth the effort to\nembark on serious talks'.\nDespite the Rector's in sistance that the discussions were of a very\npreliminary nature, the working\nparty has been requested to report\nto the Rector of IC and the Principal\nof RHBNC by the end of October.\nThe University Grants Committee\n(UGC) have agreed to fund the\nmerger leading to speculation that\nthe merger will definately go ahead.\nThe Rector told FELIX that this\nwas not the case and said that 'there\nmust be an overwhelming will for\nthe merger to take place on both\nsides.' He added that the UGC\ncould not force the institutions to\nmerge.\nA merger with RHBNC would\nease the accommodation problems\nat IC by enabling new residences to\nbe built on land from the RHB&C site. According to the Rector, first\nand second year students would be\nbased in Egham whilst South\nKensington would be reserved for\nthird years and Postgraduates.\nGovernment proposals to\nintroduce Poll Tax will make it\ndifficult for many students to afford\nto live in the centre of London. The\nRector pointed out that, given the\nsite in Egham, it would be possible\nto house students in certain years at\nIC, at rents no more than on the\npresent site.\nProfessor Ash went on to say\nthat the move would greatly\nstrengthen the humanities stream in\nIC. He drew comparisons between\nIC and the Massachussets Institute\nof Technology (MIT) which is strong\non humanities.\nThe humanities stream at RHBNC\nis of a high standard, particularly in\nthe fields of drama and history.\nThe standard of the RHBNC\nScience departments is greatly\nbelow that of IC, but the Rector is\nkeen to dispel fears of standards\nfalling if the merger goes ahead. He\ntold FELIX that most of the Science\ndepartments would operate with IC\nstaff and added that as the merger\nwould be a slow process and that\nmany RHBNC staff may first\nleave.\nThe fact that the social life of IC\nwould be greatly disturbed,\nparticularly with respect to societies\nand clubs is not debatable. If\ndifferent years in the College were\nhoused separately in South\nKensington and Egham, the effect\nwould be dramatic. The Rector\nbelieves it would be 'quite\npossible' for people to move\nbetween the sites for the purposes\nof social activity\u2014a journey he\nestimated at 35 minutes, but which\ntook 1 hour 10 minutes by sin\nat 8.30pm. RHBNC\ntackle\ndebts\nI Royal Holloway and Bedford New\nCollege are investigating proposals\nto sell off their land and art\ncollection in an attempt to solve\ntheir increasing financial problems.\nThe College is \u00a3lm in debt, a figure which is expected to increase\nto \u00a34.5m by 1992. According the\nChairman of RHBNC Council, the\nCollege faces the possibility of\ninsolvency by 1990.\nThe College are considering\nselling one or two of the pictures in\nthe Holloway Collection along with\nsome of the 18 acres of land\nbelonging to the college.\nThe land is believed to be valued at\n\u00a3750,000 to \u00a3lm per acre.\nRoyal Holloway's financial\ndifficulties result from a combination\nof reduced University Grants\nCommittee (UGC) funding and\nunexpected costs which arose from\nthe merger of Royal Holloway and\nNew College.\nThe College has attempted to\nreduce its deficit by reducing\nstaffing levels and expenditure.\nThe College'spr inc ple, MP Dorothy Wedderburn, has\nannounced the College's plans to\nincrease their non-Government\nincome 'which would bring them\ninto balance by 1992 or 1993'. The\nplan called for \u00a31.5m to set the\nscheme up.\nRHBNC submitted a case for\nspecial funding during the years\n1988 - 1992 to the court of\nLondon University detailing the\nplan. In view of problems\nexperienced by other schools of the\nUniversity, the court felt unable to\nforward a special case for RHBNC\nto the UGC. The Council of the\nCollege forwarded its case directly\nto the UGC and was awarded\n\u00a3350,000 per annum for the next two\nyears which was significantly less\ntha\" Collet's requirements\nISSUE814 I98 "

    "content": "Reviews\nCINEMA\nYeelen\nPG, Renoir, Brunswick Square\nImagine an African legend conjured\nup to fill the big screen with\nunceasingly stunning pictures, and\nhere you have it.\nYeelen is a purely African product,\nmade with a budget large enough to\nallow a powerful and professional\nproduction which serves only to\nenhance the 'primitive' quality of\nwhat we are seeing.\n'Yeelen' means 'the light', and\ncertainly the most remarkable thing\nabout the film is its physical beauty;\neverywhere the desert glows with\na rich yellow, with bright green trees\nfor relief from the dried, cracked\nmud over which our hero finds\nhimself wandering. His mother\nstands chest-deep in muddy water\nfilled with green reeds, pouring a white milk-like liquid over her head,\nwhile summoning up good spirits to\nprotect her son. And he needs it,\nbecause daddy is coming to kill him.\nFather and son are both magic\nmakers, and the story follows the\nyoung man's travel around Mali\ngaining self-knowledge, and hence\npower, until he is ready to confront\nhis father.\nThe roots of legend are common\nthroughout the world, and shine\nmore powerfully in such a basic\nenvironment, where death and\nmysticism are both close to the\nearth. Life is lived with a much\nstronger immediacy here, and\nwhether you view magic as\nsymbolic of power of will, or as a genuine mystic. The startling\nimages presented in this film will\nallow no disbelief or dismissal.\nDream Demon\n(Cert 18) Odeon, Leicester Square\nA shy and innocent slo any, Diana\nMarkham (Jemma Redgrave) exists\nin a perfect world: wealthy parents,\napartment in London and a handsome Falklands war hero, her\nfiance, waiting in the wings. But\nThe House on\nCarroll Street\nCert PG.\nNew York, 1951. An attractive\nyoung woman faces a Senate\ncommittee of enquiry\u2014not unlike\nthe recent experiences of one Oliver\nNorth. She is a woman passionately\nconcerned with human rights, but\nwith World War Two hardly over,\nshe is a woman before her time.\nLegends persist in every culture,\nbecause it is through looking at our\nroots that we can discover our\ncommon humanity (and animal it y). In this film a tribe attempts to slit\nour hero's throat until he overcomes\nthem by force (of magic); then he is\naccepted, having proved himself.\nThere is no room for weakness, and\nsociety seems harsh. Yet once they\nhave accepted the young man, the\nKing and his tribe display a loyalty\neverything is not perfect for long.\nHer sleep is disturbed by savage,\nterrifying nightmares. She dreams\nof decapitating her fiance at the\nalter, of being molested by him...\nShe is befriended by an American\nstreetwise punk et te, Jenny\n(Kathleen Whilhorte), who it seems\nused to live in Diana's house.

Our man himself rejects the\nKing's offer of wealth and worldly\npower, to return to the desert.\nDo not go to see this film if you\nare sensitive or prefer\n'sophisticated' acting and character\ninterplay, it attempts neither. What\nit will do is lift you out of your city-stimulated life, with all its ups and\ndowns, and capture your mind for\ncan't remember anything about her\nchildhood and so has returned to\nher roots to find out who she really\nis. Meanwhile Diana's dreams turn\nhorribly real...\nAnd so the scene is set for this\nBritish chiller that tries its best to\nimitate Nightmare on Elm Street. A lot\nof the film comprises of the two\nwomen running through gloomy,\nsmoke-filled passages with\nanguished looks on their faces, as\nDiana wanders from dream to\ndream. It seems that a psychic\nthread exists between Diana and\nJenny that influences the dreams.\nAfter a while, the dreams affect their\nreal lives, although just how was\nmade unclear, under a cloud of\npsychology. Indeed, it was often\ndifficult to fathom out what was real\nand what wasn't, or even if there\nwas a distinction. Towards the end,\nDiana shouts (as if to help us out)\n'Don't you see? This is real'. I felt\nlike shouting back 'No, I don't see\nat all, actually'.\nmeet in a sticky end, but she is\nsaved by FBI agent Cochran, played\nby Jeff Daniels (Terms of Endearment,\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo, Heartburn)\nwho provides a touch of humour\nand the brief romantic interest.\nCochran eventually sides with\nEmily in her right to expose\ncorruption in the highest places\n(remember Watergate, Irangate,\netc.?) and to allow good to\nconquer.\nThe House on Carroll Street has a good basic, if familiar plot, but is let\ndown by the script which is, in\nplaces, a touch clich ed and \u00bbt times\ndrags. However, director Peter\nYates, who has directed such films\nas Summer Holiday (yes, the one with\nCliff Richard!) and Steve\nMcQueen's classic thriller Bullit,\ndoes a good job and just about gets\nthere.\nThere are the obligatory twists to\nthe tale, the hero, the heroine and\nthe bad guys, but I would question\nwhether the ten seconds of romance\nshould allow the film to be billed as\na romantic thriller.\nA tense, but predictable\ncliffhanger finishes this watch able, though not outstanding thriller\u2014but\nat least it doesn't all end happily\never after.\nMatt Rampton.\n105 minutes, leaving many images\nlingering for a long time.\nYeelen shows us many common\nelements of mankind, in a way that\nthe vast majority of western movies\nfail to do. This, apart from the\nstunning photography, is a reason\nto see a film with no counterpart in\ncontemporary cinema.\nI think the word is\nuncompromising.\nSusan Appleby.\nAlthough confusing, the film\nholds our attention, if only to figure\nout what the hell is going on; and\nthe climax is suitably arousing with\nthe mysteries explained by Jenny's forgotten past.\nComic relief is provided by a pair\nof thoroughly despicable local\njournalists, played by Jimmy Nail\nand Tim Spall (both from Auf\nWiedersehn Pet), who hound the\nfemale pair constantly. I found this\nmisplaced humour irritating, as it\noffset the mood of the film.\nThe whole film has the look of an\narty film that had to conform to the\nformulation of more conventional\nAmerican horror flicks, for\ncommercial purposes. But this film\nretains an identity of its own,\nalthough all things considered, it is\nstill trashy.\nI wouldn't recommend paying the\nextortionate Odeon Leicester Square\nprices to see this, but maybe when\nit's out on general release.\nSumit Guha.\nPage 14 FELIX October 21 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Union\nPresident's bit\nAccommodation Crisis?\nOver the past week a few people\nhave been into my office to\ncomplain about their rents. I can\nsym pathis e with their problem but\nthe facts surrounding the situation\nneed to be considered.\nDue to the strict financial\nregulations imposed upon the\nCollege by the Government, no\npublic money can be used to\nsupport the residences. This means\nthat new residences must be paid\nfor by the students, through ii.eir\nhall bills in future years. In 1986 the\nresidence stock was expanded and\nbecause of this the rents have had\nto go up. When Christine Taig was\nPresident she signed an agreement\nwhich limited the rises in rents and,\nto date, that agreement has been\nhonoured.\nThe question of whether the\ncharge for the twelfth week is fair,\nor not, has also been raised. When\nthis was raised at the Student\nResidence Committee meeting of\nthe June 8 this year this was seen as\na necessary evil and was passed\nwith no objections. I am therefore\nbound by the Committees decision\nto support these extra charges. This\nis because last year's President was\none of those who did not object.\nOnly Union policy can change this.\nI am therefore asking people to pay\ntheir full rent charge, because if they\ndon't, future students will have to\npay more.\nWelfare Survey\nNext week each of the College's5,500 students will receive a survey\nthat is being run by the students'\nUnion. A lot of time, effort and\nmoney has gone into this survey.\nThis will all be wasted if you do not\nfill it in and return it. Please help us\nDP's doo be ry Timetabling\nDo you know that the College has\nspecific regulations on when\nlectures/labs/tutorials can be\ntimetabled? It appears that some\nDepartments are unaware of this.\nNo classes may be timetabled\nbetween the hours of 12.30 and\n14.30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays\nduring the Autumn and Spring\nterms, nor may any classes take\nplace after 12.30 on Wednesdays\nthroughout the year, according to\nCollege regulations.\nSo far this term I have uncovered\ntwo instances of courses where\nthere are several lectures or labs\noccurring during the above\nmentioned hours, in direct\ncontravention of College policy.\nI heard about these problems\nbecause certain students\napproached me concerning them.\nThey did not wish to approach their\ndepartment directly for fear of\nacademic reprisals. So if you are\nfaced with a similar problem,\nwhatever your department, please\ncome and speak to me in confidence\nabout the matter, so that I can take\nit up with the relevant people.\nSports Shop Sale\nAs a result of the move by STA into\nthe old Sports Shop, the shop has\nbeen relocated to the Jazz Room in\nthe Union Building (just up the\nstairs from the Union Office), and\nwill open from 11am to 2pm Monday to Friday. We have a large\namount of stock which needs to be\ncleared. To this effect, the Union\nwill be holding a sale of regalia,\nsports clothing and accessories in the\nJCR on Wednesday 2nd and\nThursday 3rd November. More\ndetails nearer the date. To all club\ncaptains and chairmen: If there are\nany of you who have regalia in the\nsports shop, please can you see me\nas soon as possible.\nRoom Bookings\nWhen clubs book rooms within the\nUnion building or the JCR, it is then-responsibility to ensure that the\nroom is clean after use. If rooms are\nfound to be untidy or need further\ncleaning then the additional costs\nwill be deducted from the room\ndeposit, and all future bookings will\nautomatically be referred to the\nExec. This may mean a delay of up\nto 2 weeks before subsequent\nbookings are confirmed. You have\nbeen warned!\nCharles Brereton.\nto help you by completing your\nform, it will take half an hour at\nmost, as honestly as possible by\nFriday November 4. There is no way\nresults can be traced back to you so\nall the answers are totally\nanonymous.\nWelfare '89 is the most ambitious\nwelfare project ever to be attempted\nat this College. Its aim is to obtain\na databank of information about\nyou, the students of IC. This will\nthen be used to show which areas\nneed to be addressed in each of four\nweek-long campaigns to be run\nthroughout the year, Towards the\nend of the year the success of these\ncampaigns will be measured.\nInitial survey\nNext week all the 5,000 students of\nthe College will receive a survey\nquestionnaire via their departmental\npigeonholes. This questionnaire is\nnot small and it will take time to fill\nin, I do not apologise for this. If we\nare to identify the needs of our\nstudents this must, be done\nthoroughly and this survey is\nnothing if not thorough. When you\nreceive your questionnaire you will\nsee that a large section of it asks\nsome very personal questions.\nPlease answer these as honestly as\npossible since there is absolutely no\nway the answers can be traced back\nto the individual. Once your form\nhas been returned to the box with\nyour departmental messengers it\nbecomes just one of up to 5,000\nreturned forms.\nIn the past these surveys have\nfailed because people were not\nprepared to do the analysis to obtain\nthe results. This year I have\narranged for a market research\ncompany, to do this analysis. All we\nneed to do is 'idiot-read' the forms,\nj that is go through them to make\nsure they make sense. We will need\nhelp to do this so if you want to be\ninvolved please contact me via the\nUnion Office.\nCampaigns\nThe information from these surveys\nwill dictate the direction the\ncampaigns will take. Some people\nhave asked whether we need to\neducate our students at all. I will\nanswer this by quoting the results\nof a recent straw poll of 100 of IC's students. 65 of the sample believed\nthat you could get AIDS from giving\nblood. If you are someone who\nbelieves that this is true, then you\nneed educating. If you are one of the\n'educated' 35 per cent, don't get\nblas e,I'm sure that there is some\nmisconception you hold that needs\nchanging.\nThe campaigns are not aimed to\npreach at people, they are to\nincrease awareness. I will be\nworking closely with the local health\neducation authority and so the\nmedia used will be interesting and\nvaried. Some events already\nplanned are; an IC AIDS day with\ndoctors, drug companies and the\nTerrence Higgins Trust; a nonalcoholic bar promotion and a 'uses\nand abuses' quiz night.\nFollow-up survey\nIn the Summer Term there is to be\na follow-up survey to see if we have\nchanged any attitudes. This will be\nmuch smaller than the first survey\nbut more of that nearer the time.\nI hope you will realise the\nimportance of Welfare '89 and will\ngive it your full support from the\nstart by filling in your questionnaire\nand returning it by Friday October 4.\nNigel D Baker, ICU President.\nUncle Ian\nFirst, the what's on bit:\nTomorrow night sees the Annual\nSteer-Rides Conference in the Union\nBar with suitably awesome country\n& western music.\nOn Wednesday there will be the\nsecond of our regular discos with a happy hour between 7-8pm. As a result of enquiries about the\nvideo screen that was hired for\nFreshers' Week, the Union has\ndecided to buy a50\" system for\ninternal use. This will be made\navailable to clubs etc on a hire basis\nin order that repayment to the\nUnion Finance Committee can be\neffected as quickly as possible.\nThere are still certain aspects\nregarding security, hire charge, etc\nto be decided but please get in\ncontact with me if you are interested\nin using the system.\nI 've not ad that there have been a number of boat cruises recently and\nI think fr tata good discount could\nbe achieved if they were booked\ncentrally through the Union,\nparticularly considering the high\nlevel of involvement of one cruise\nfirm in other areas of the Union's activities. So if anyone requires a boat, come and have a word with\nUncle Ian first.\nIan Morris, ICU Hon Sec.\nOctober 21 1988 FELIX Page 19\n\n"

    "content": "News Feature\nIC: a high dropout rate?\nby RUPERT CLAYTON\nThe pages of The Independent have\nseen some interesting correspondence over the past two weeks. On\nWednesday October 5 the\nnewspaper published an article\nentitled 'Completion rates vary\nwidely for degrees'. It revealed that\nin all the subject areas in which\nImperial was represented we were\nin the bottom three when it came to\nthe successful completion of\ndegrees. The statistics, on the\nacademic years 84/85 to 86/87 were\ndrawn from a report of the\nCommittee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals and the University Grants\nCommittee. These completion rates\nare given below. The article noted\nthat 'One possible explanation for\nthe differences (in successful\ncompletion rates) is that some\ndiversities recruit more able\ns tui.^ nts who are more likely to\ncomi3t e courses successfully. But\nImpe al College, London, where\nsuccess rates are low, has some of\nthe most highly qualified students.'\nOn Saturday October 8 The\nIndependent published a letter from\n'Professor John Sherfield, Imperial\nCollege, London'. Professor\nSherfield stated that, 'it is the\nbusiness of a college to transform a student from adolescence to\nmanhood', and, 'if their idea (the\nstudents) of growing up is to learn\nhow to wave banners on\ndemonstrations or take drugs, then\nit should come as no shock to learn\nthat a certain percentage do not\nachieve the high standards which\nImperial College demands.'\nThis was followed on Tuesday\nOctober 11 by a letter from College\nSecretary John Smith pointing out\nthat Saturday's letter was a hoax\nand presenting the College's argument as to why the reported\nfigures were distorted.\nThe College's argue ment states\nthat during the period over which\nthe statistics were compiled, 700\npeople who were no longer students\nwere 'dumped' from College\nrecords when College transferred\nfrom manual to computerised\nstudent records. These students\nwere people who had jailed some\ntime ago but were s ff lf recognised as\nstudents although 'not in\nattendance'.All of this stemmed,\nfrom their right, under Londonj\nUniversity Examination:\ntheir failed examinations (twice if\nexaminations (twice if necessary).\nRecords were kept of these\nstudents as it 'avoided the hassle'\nof recreating a student's file at the\nUniversity and Universities\nStatistical Record (USR). Figures\nprovided by the College and those\nfrom this year's Alternative\nProspectus are reproduced below.\nThese letters and the original\narticle raise some questions. Firstly,\nthe 700 students who were taken\nout of the record must be accounted\nfor somewhere. Where?\nThe College and the USR compile'\ndata in two very different forms.\nCollege follow a particular entry of\nstudents through their degrees and;\neighteen months after graduation\ncompile statistics on success and\nfailure. Information for the USR is\nprovided via the University of\nLondon and this method demands\u2022\ndata on those successfully\ncompleting in a particular year in\ncomparison to all those who left\nduring that year excluding those\nwho transferred to other colleges.\nThe Registrar admits that until\nrecently the transfer ral of\ninformation to the USR was carried\nout 'as a clerical exercise...not seen\nas conveying great benefit to the\nCollege.' Updating student records,\nat USR was seen as a lesser priority,:\nparticularly if it was of no benefit toi\nthe student concerned.'\nThe removal of failed students\nfrom the files seems only to have\nbeen undertaken periodically thus\nleaving the College's own statistics\nas the only reliable indicator of\ndropout rates. What is not made\nclear is whether the 700 failed\nstudents are included in those\ndocumented in Table 2 or whether\nthey have been excluded from the\nstatistics altogether.\nAnother reasonable question is\nwhy College allowed such patently\nfalse statistics to be included in the\nCVCP/UGC Report. Similarly one\nwould have hoped that The\nIndependent would have smelt a rat\nwhen they received such a reactionary letter as 'Professor\nSherfield's'. The good news is that anyone on\nthe Materials course can sleep\npeacefully at night as there is little\npossibility of them failing.\nTABLE 1 -Successful leave rs as a percentage of students\nending their studies\nSubject area Percentage\nBiological Sciences 80%\nPhysical Sciences 78%\nMathematical Sciences 73%\nEngineering and Technology 67%\nCombined Sciences 70%\nTABLE 2-College completion rate figures198083 entry\n1980 1981 1982 1983\nentry entry entry entry\n% % % %\nObtained first degree in normal period 82.1 82.0 84.2 82.3\nObtained first degree in more than normal period 6.3 5.7 4.2 4.1\nTotal qualified 88.4 87.7 88.4 86.4\nStill in attendance 0.5 .4 .4 .2\nLeft by reason of academic failure 7.3 6.0 5.0 6.4\nLeft for other reasons 3.8 4.9 5.2 6.0\n100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\nTABLE 3 - College s justification of '87% Graduate'\nCVCP/UGC Report\nIC Figures\nCVCP/UGC figures Hess the 700\n'dumped' records l Total\nGraduating\n2901\n2894\n2901\nTotal %\nLeavers Graduating\n4019 72%\n3339 87%\n3319 87%\nTABLE 4-Completion rates for the 1983 entry (from the AP update)\nGraduated in Failed to Left due to\nnormal time graduate in academic\nnormal time failure\n% % %\nAeronautics 66.7 33.3 8.3\nChem Eng 80.5 19.5 7.8\nChemistry 87.8 12.2 4.9\nCivil Eng 84.0 16.0 2.5\nComputing 83.7 16.3 3.5\nElec Eng 83.9 16.1 8.1\nGeology 79.2 20.8 2.1\nLife Sci 80.4 19.6 6.5\nMaterials 91.9 8.1 0\nMathematics 70.3 29.7 13.2\nMech Eng 79.3 20.6 6.9\nMin Res Eng 61.0 39.0 27.9\nPhysics 90.2 9.8 4.9\nPage 8 FELIX October 21 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Natural resources\nto produce pig-iron, which is worth\nfar more per ton as an export? With\nBrazil's economic problems this is a good idea, but in the absence of any\nsuitable coal reserves they need to\nuse charcoal. The consequence of\nthis is that outside the perimeter\nfence of the World Bank project,\nIt takes 100 years for\na decent sized tree to\ngrow\nvast areas of forest have already\nbeen felled to produce charcoal to\nfeed the first three of twenty\nplanned iron smelters, with many\nthousands of acres of forest under\nthreat. It was production of charcoal\nwhich caused the massive\ndeforestation of Southern England\nand consequent energy crisis in the\n16th century; this project is on a much larger scale.\nHydroelectricity\nWith the largest river system in the\nworld, the Amazon basin offers an\nideal opportunity to produce cheap\nelectricity which would be a great\nasset to Brazil's economy. The\ntheoretical potential of the\nAmazon's suitable sites is 130,000\nMegawatts, which could be\nobtained by flooding 60,000 sq km,\nor 1% ot the Amazon Basin,\nproviding far more energy for many\nyears than simply burning the wood\ncontained in this 1%. Some schemes\nhave been very successful, for\nexample the Tucuri Dam on a tributary near the mouth of the\nAmazon produces 5,000 MW, more\nthan Drax in Yorkshire, which is\nEurope's largest coal-fired power\nstation.\nA second scheme at Balbina was\nbuilt to serve the city of Manaus on\nthe Amazon. This has been a complete disaster, economically and\nenvironmentally and has been called\nthe world's least efficient\nThe World's least\nefficient H.E. P plant\nhydroelectric plant. Conceived in\nthe mid-1970s and responsible for\n\u00a3770 million of Brazilian foreign\ndebt, it will not have a single turbine\noperating before the end of this\nyear. It is too shallow, at an average\nof eight metres deep which means\nthat the power generated will be\npitifully small, 109MW, from a lake\nwhich has flooded 1450 sq km of\nrainforest (350,000 acres). Most\nwater is lost by evaporation with the\nconsequence that the small river\nwhich feeds the lake does not\nprovide enough water. The scheme\nwill eventually only produce half as\nmuch power as is required by the\ncity it was built to serve.\nGlobal Environment\nIt is the effects on the global\nenvironment that the large scale\nburning of forests should be of great\nconcern to us all. The 1987 burning\nof 80,000 square miles of forest\nreleased an estimated 620 million\ntonnes of carbon dioxide and\nparticulate carbon into the\natmosphere. The carbon dioxide is\nadding to the gradual build up of\nthis gas in the atmosphere which\nmay be leading to a 'greenhouse\neffect', particularly as the Amazon\nforests play an important part in the\nglobal carbon cycle. The large\nquantities of particulate matter are\nof similar magnitude to the amounts\ngiven off by giant volcanic\nForests are in danger\nof disappearing\ncompletely\nerr up t ions which have had\nobservable effects on weather\nconditions for many months. The\neffects of this year's forest burning\nseason have been observed all over\nthe South American continent. It is\nhard to know how much of current\nworries about pollution are real long\nterm problems and how much is\nscare mongering on the part of\nenvironmentalists, but it is clear that\nthe large scale destruction of forests\n\u2022cannot be having a good effect on\nthe environment.\nWhat can we do?\nNot a lot really. Using recycled\npaper and not using hardwoods\nfrom the rainforests merely tickle\nthe surface of the problem. As I said\nearlier, if managed properly, forests\nshould be able to supply our needs\nfor timber without any problems;\ntimber production is in any case\nnegligible compared to projects like\nthe Gran Carajas charcoal for iron\nsmelting project. It shouldn't be\nforgotten that we are buying the\ncheap iron from Brazil.\nWhat is needed is a firm\nenvironmental policy for Brazil and\nfor the developed nations of the\nworld to force Brazil to do this. The\nAmazon, if properly developed,\ncould make Brazil one of the richest\nnations in the world\u2014current\nprogress is heading in the direction\nof environmental disaster, not only\nfor Brazil, but possibly the rest of the\nworld.\nBrazil has the biggest problem\nbecause it has the biggest forest, but\nthere are areas of the world whose\nforests are in more immediate\ndanger. For example central\nForests are in danger\nof disappearing\ncompletely\nAmerica and parts of the Far East,\nwhere forests are in danger of\ndisappearing completely due to over\nexploitation. Apart from the\nproblems of flooding and the\nPanama Canal, the exhaustion of\nthese forests will mean an even\nbigger strain on the forests of the\nAmazon. It is therefore all the more\nimportant that Brazil should learn to\nsupply these needs without\nirreversibly damaging the forests.\nWood is a unique material.\nScience\nP.S. Since I wrote this article, new\nmeasures have been announced by\nPresident Sarney of Brazil to protect\nthe Amazon rainforests, in response\n\\ln dust ry replaces forest\nto the global outcry at this year's level of destruction. Amongst these\nmeasures are the restriction of\nsubsidies for agriculture in the\nAmazon region (it was a policy\nstarted in the 1960's whereby\nfarmers were given land, provided\nthat they cleared half of it of trees,\nthat has caused many of today's problems), a total ban on the export\nof logs, and rigorous environmental\ncontrols are to be imposed on all\nj agricultural and industrial projects\njin the future. These measures are\nobviously a welcome step in the\nright direction, but the criticism has\nbeen made that it is merely window\ndressing to stay international\npressure. Nothing, for example, has\nbeen said about the Carajas pig iron\nsmelters, which are likely to destroy\nthe entire eastern Amazon if no\naction is taken now.\nOctober 21 1988 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
