    "content": "A R T S\nFELIX\n22\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOf all the Karma Sutra books on the market, this\nwould be the easiest to read on the tube without\nupsetting conservative commuters. As a Kindle edi-tion, it comes without an erotic front cover, allowing\ndiscreet study of the sensual arts in the most\npublic of places. There\nare no diagrams inside\n\u2013 on the one hand a\nlittle disappointing, as\nalthough positions are\ndescribed very clearly\nin the text, visual aid\nwould clear any possible confusion \u2013 but it is\nagain a plus for Kindle\nowners like myself, who\nlike to read everywhere,\nwithout fearing over-the-shoulder peekers.\nThe book is very comprehensive and covers every aspect of love-making. The Karma Sutra beginner would find the \u2018Seduction\u2019 section enlightening,\nand there are plenty of valuable new techniques for\neven the most experienced readers to learn. To start,\nindividuals are guided to separate themselves into\ndifferent types depending on their genital size. For\nmen: the hare, the bull and the horse. For women:\nthe deer, the mare and the elephant. Lovers should\nthen choose positions most suitable for their combi-nation. According to the book, \u201cthe least satisfying\nscenario is a hare man with an elephant woman\u201d. A\nlittle more clarity on exactly which positions are best\nfor which combinations would have been helpful, only\nsome rather general guidelines are given.\nThe best aspect of the book is the great volume\nof extra advice which accompanies the position de-scriptions. The book reads like a thorough exploration of erotic pleasure, rather than a dry list of sexual\nacrobatics (the kind of book we are so used to). The\nmaterial also has a pleasantly modern feel about it,\nwithout removing emphasis from the original Karma\nSutra philosophies. Overall this book makes an excellent addition to your Kindle library, and since it\u2019s\ntransmitted wirelessly, you can guarantee its delivery\nin time for Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s also available in pa-perback, for those who seek a fresh approach to their\nlove-making, but find themselves lacking a Kindle.\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nWe rate the mother of all famously\nsensual books... on a Kindle\nThe Modern\nKarma\nSutra By Kamini Thomas & Kirk Thomas\nWhich book do you love more than any other? Tell\nus why it\u2019s so good - Send 300 to 400 words to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYour memorable Valentine\nIt may be a ridiculously overhyped and commercialised,\nbut then again, we\u2019ll take any excuse for a celebration\nThis story starts with clenched, muscular but-tocks. The buttocks in question comprise the\ncover art of the latest Scissor Sisters album\nNight Work and while they certainly deserve a\nsecond glance you would not grasp their full\nsignificance unless you had also knew of the\nman who took that photograph: Robert Mapplethorpe.\nThe Scissor Sisters, in case you do not know,\nare fantasic glam-rock/pop/dance band from\nNew York who emerged from the city\u2019s gay\nscene in 2000. After the group chose Mapplethorpe\u2019s work for an album cover they\nwere approached to curate an exhibition at the\nAlison Jacques Gallery in London. I was in-trigued, between this photographer and such a\nbrilliant band there was a great tangle of glam\nrock, high art and homoeroticism to unravel.\nMapplethorpe was a controversial artist active in New York from the early 70\u2019s. A long-term partner of Patti Smith, they eventually\nbroke up after he came out as gay. Examples of\nhis work now sit in the National Portrait Gallery, but at the time he was heavily criticised for\nhis approach to racial and homosexual themes.\nBefore dying of complications relating to AIDS\nin 1989, he succeeded in splitting the art world\nin two with his short lifetime of work, which\noften featuring highly classical portraits of men\nexposing themselves or engaging in sexual acts.\nA word of warning if you intend to visit;\nthe gallery space is split over two buildings\nin the same street. Do not forget, as I did, to\nvisit them both. The sign at the entrance warns\nvisitors of explicit images and this is no exag-geration. There is work from a number of other\nartists influenced by Mapplethorpe.\nOswaldo Macia and Gillian Wearing deserve\nspecial mention. However, none came close to\nstealing the show. Mapplethorpe rules supreme\nand the exhibition features the full spectrum of\nhis photography. It ranges from delicate, sensuous photos to some very challenging, obscene\nportraits. My reaction to the photos was initially\nshock, but this was soon moderated to wonder.\nIt is impossible to deny his talent in a technical\nsense. All his work is immaculately and cleverly\ncomposed in such a way that he actually demonstrates considerable restraint. In every case the\nmodels are portrayed intimately as creatures of\nperfect beauty and subtlety.\nThere is a potent sense of tension in all his\npictures. The muses, male and female, mostly\ndancers, strain against fabrics or bonds, muscles\nbunching as if poised to jump from the frame\nand connect tangibly with you. The fact that you\nrarely see their faces focuses the viewer on the\nsensual. Other works in the gallery feature mirrors which achieve the same effect.As you catch\nsight of your own reflection you are framed\nin the gallery, forced to view yourself through\nMapplethorpe\u2019s vision of human sexuality.\nDespite being charged with sexual energy\nthere is never the suggestion that you are viewing anything close to pornography. This is not\nsimple titillation; there are overt liberal messages in many of his pieces. The iconic image\nof a man in a suit, his large black penis jutting\nproudly out, screams out a desire for liberty.\nIn the context of a time when racism and homophobia were still commonplace, this is a passionate battle cry. The owner of the buttocks,\na dancer named Peter Reed, was to fall victim\na AIDS a few years after the photo was taken.\nThe dark subject matter could leave you morose but in fact you come away with a sense\nof celebration. It is interesting that when inter-viewed, Mapplethorpe said of his work \u201c[that]\nIt was about me, what I wanted to see\u201d. The\nScissor Sisters have made sure that the gallery\nis balanced with pure 80s glam. The homage is\nnot just to the sacrifices made by New York\u2019s\ngay community during the period but to its life\nand vibrancy. Macia\u2019s video installation, for ex-ample, shows an aerial silk performer dressed\nhead to toe in black latex performing on two\nwhite ribbons. This nod to the band\u2019s obsession\nwith dance is truly beautiful and upbeat.\nSo what is the message to take home? Well,\nit is a particularly appropriate one given a certain auspicious date in the near future. Human\nsexuality is a strange, beautiful thing. It has as\nmany weird and wonderful variations as there\nare people on this planet. Whether this Valentine\u2019s Day will be spent in the arms of your beloved or at home with ice-cream, be happy you\nare alive, filthy/gorgeous... and you can dance.\nNight Work is on at the Alison Jaques gallery until 19th March\nButt-clenchingly good: that album cover from the Scissor Sisters, which kicked the whole thing off\nMeredith Thomas\nThe ultimate guide to the\nsecrets of erotic pleasure\n(Kindle Edition)\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n10\nScience Editors: Charlie Harvey\nKelly Oakes\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDr. Riemann\u2019s Zeros\nby Karl Sabbagh\nAnd a few suggestions...\nYou won\u2019t believe it...\nThis Valentines Day, instead of following your heart\ngo with your brain. Researchers have identified\na dozen brain regions associated with the feeling\nof being in (puppy) love. The regions release neurotransmitters and other chemicals that induce sensations such as attraction and pleasure. And if you\nbreak up before the big day, don\u2019t worry. Scientists\nare hoping to treat broken hearts by artificially adjusting the levels of these chemicals.\nThis is the story of a million dollar problem, one that\nwas created by the famous Dr. Riemann when he\nproduced an answer to a mathematical conundrum\nbut without a robust proof to accompany it. Mathematicians have slaved over the Riemann hypothesis,\nracing to uncover the truth and prompting the offer\nof a million dollar prize for a comprehensive proof. It\nall sounds like a slightly melodramatic thriller, and\nperhaps this is as close as a popular mathematics\nbook will get.\nBoth interesting and informative, Sabbagh\u2019s writing is the perfect introduction to this area of math-ematics, leaving the reader with a sense of awe\nat the genius of the mathematicians involved. He\npaints an exhilarating picture of the discipline, going\nsome way to expel the myth that maths is boring.\nSabbagh finds exactly the right way of engaging his\naudience; after all, making a lot of money in a highly\ncompetitive industry sounds like a dream job, especially for an Imperial graduate.\nKatya-yani Vyas\nMagic show success open to\nCopenhagan interpretation\nKadhim Shubber\nIt is somewhat topsy-turvy to say that there are\nno mysteries in magic, but plenty in physics.\nBut as Dr Nic Harrigan, our Master of Ceremonies for the evening (complete with magician\u2019s\nattire), explained: all magic tricks are expli-cable, but not all physics is yet understood.\nAnd no area of physics is as enigmatic and so\nbegging of explanation than quantum mechan-ics. \u2018Real Tricks: The Quantum Mechanics\nShow\u2019 aims to draw parallels between magic\ntricks and the quirks of quantum mechanics.\nAs we settled down for the show, it struck me\nthat linking quantum mechanics with a magician\u2019s tricks most adequately demonstrated the\npower with which it has to bewilder even the\nmost skilled physicists; as Richard Feynman\nfamously opined: \u201cI think it is safe to say that\nno one understands quantum mechanics.\u201d\nThe show had an amateurish charm to it. The\nperformers were modestly dressed with an earnest enthusiasm for the concepts that they were\nexplaining.\nAlthough not master magicians, they pulled\noff the tricks convincingly enough to elicit\ngasps, laughs and whispers of \u201cHow did she\ndo that?\u201d Obviously if I were to Google any\nof the tricks, I could quickly ruin the magic for\nmyself. But the demonstration of quantum entanglement was a genuine puzzler. To demonstrate the weird connection between entangled\nparticles, coloured balls were first placed into\nsoft, velvet bags. They were rubbed together\nto \u2018entangle\u2019 them and then, from opposite\nsides of the room, the performers simultaneously pulled the same colour ball from bag.\nThis demonstrated the peculiar property of entangled particles that allows them to \u2018know\u2019the\nproperties of the other \u2013 measure one electron\nas spin up and the other will instantaneously\nmeasure as spin down. Initially, I did not suspend my disbelief entirely \u2013 perhaps they had\nhidden balls in their sleeves? \u2013 but when they\nrepeated it with audience members I was unashamedly stumped.\nThere were other highlights. Pushing a pencil\nthrough a \u00a31 coin as an analogue of quantum\ntunnelling was neat while the explanation of\nquantum cryptography \u2013 complete with ninjas\nleaping out of the audience to steal the \u2018data\u2019\n\u2013 reached the highest standard of educational\nentertainment.\nHowever, saying that the show had an \u201camateurish charm\u201d does not excuse all of its rough\nedges. At times the little hiccups distracted the\ngood-natured audience and Dr Nic Harrigan\ncould probably have given his co-performers\nthe courtesy of introducing them on-stage by\nname.\nBut I shouldn\u2019t over-emphasise the little nig-gles. Judging by the attentive silence and then\noutpouring laughter from the audience behind\nme, it was certainly a successful evening. Probably most pleasing was the sight of groups of\nchildren excitedly discussing the physics that\nthey had seen as they tramped up the aisles out\nof the lecture theatre.\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nTake two leeches and call me tomorrow\nMost of us believe that leeches belong to the\ncategory of the most disgusting and dangerous\ncreatures of this world. They can, however be\nbeneficial for people\u2019s health.\nLeeches \u2013 the word deriving from the old\nEnglish word for physician, laece \u2013 are mainly\nused for treating abscesses, painful joints, glau-coma, myasthenia, and to heal venous diseases\nand thrombosis. They are also used in plastic\nsurgery and can improve brain circulation.\nThese medical applications of the leeches are\nthe main topic of a recent paper published in\nthe Journal of Postgraduate Medicine last week.\nThe team of scientists from Ohio State University Medical found that leeches have been\nfairly chosen as one of the best assistants to\ndoctors, from antiquity until now. The authors\nsay: \u201cModern leech therapy is based on sound\nscientific principles and has resulted in important patient care enhancements\u201d.\nLet\u2019s look in more detail the behaviour of\nthose creatures. They have two ways to suck\nyour blood; either they use a proboscis to puncture your skin, or they use their three jaws\nand millions of little teeth to bite their way\nin. They live almost anywhere where there is\nwater. Leeches find you by detecting skin oils,\nblood, heat, or even the carbon dioxide from\nyour breath. Although about 600 leech species\nhave been identified, only 15 are currently used\nin medicine.\nBut how do leeches know how much blood\nthe patient should lose during the treatment?\nThey take in a big amount of blood when they\nfeed and for this reason they do not feed often.\nThe European species can consume between\n5 and 15 ml of blood in a single feeding (its\nAmerican counterpart consumes ten times\nless) which is why the European leech is predominantly used. Usually, doctors use up to 10\nleeches so the patient can lose up to 150 ml of\nblood during the treatment.\nAnother question that comes into mind when\nlearning about leech therapy is whether the\nleech bite causes pain. Most patients say that it\nfeels like 2 or 3 mosquito bites, so don\u2019t worry\ntoo much; it is not painful! Leech saliva also\ncontains a painkiller, which stops its victim\nfrom feeling the bite, and an anti-coagulant,\nwhich keeps the blood from clotting.\nDouglas Chepeha, an ear, nose and throat\nsurgeon at the University of Michigan, said\nthat he treats two or three patients a year with\nleeches after rebuilding faces or mouths decimated by cancer.\nThis widespread use of leeches is the reason\nthat, in Europe, millions of leeches are sold\nevery year. Sometimes, leeches do a better\njob than other medical treatments in removing pooled blood and help the healing of skin\ngrafts; something that is well tested over the\ncenturies.\nMany people are afraid of these creatures\ncrawling on their body and of being bitten by\nthem, but they have been used since ancient\ntimes, are well tested and nowadays are routinely used. The Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) has even determined that leeches are\nmedical devices because they meet the specifi-cations, as defined by the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nNature has, once again, provided a solution\nto a crucial medical problem.\nIs it in the hat? Schr\u00f6dinger would know\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\u201cLeeches find you by detecting skin oils, blood,\nheat or even the CO2\nfrom your breath.\u201d\n\n"

Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a\nBearer of Glad Tidings, and Warner,And as one who invites to God\u2019s (grace) by His leave,\nand as a lamp spreading light.\u201d\nAs I attempt to find words concerning my beloved\n\u2013 may peace and blessings be showered upon him\n\u2013 it is these eloquent verses of Qur\u2019an that come\nto mind. When writing about Muhammad \u2013 revered\nacross a quarter of the world\u2019s population as the\nMessenger of God \u2013 the problem of \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d\nvanishes, as a lamp disperses darkness, for he is\nthe highest of inspirations to those who know him.\nIn its stead, I am faced with the dilemma of how to\narticulate the beauty and eminence of this personage in whatever my word limit works out to be!\nFor this simple reason - that this article could not\npossibly do justice to the personality and achievements of Muhammad - I therefore aim only to provide an impetus for the reader to go further than this\narticle; to serve as an introduction to a personality\nso essential to understand; to raise points for the\nconscience to ponder.\n\u201cWhen I closed the second volume (of Muhammad\u2019s biography), I was sorry there was not more\nfor me to read of the great life.\u201d \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi.\nThere can be no doubt on the position he holds\nin the hearts of Muslims \u2013 love that is expressed\nrightly by those millions who emulate his noble way,\nand wrongly by those who transgress in defence of\nhis honour. It is a love that has made his name the\nmost widespread on the planet, his resting place the\nmost frequented, his personality the most praised,\nhis habits the most imitated and his life the most\nwell-preserved. Seeing a map of the Islamic empires\nthat were \u2013 historically speaking \u2013present only yes-terday, one could come to the conclusion that Muhammad was a victor of land. Indeed, Michael Hart\nputs him at the head of \u201cThe 100: A Ranking Of The\nMost Influential Persons In History\u201d and mentions\nthat this may surprise some people but Hart placed\nat the head for his achievements both religious and\nsecular - but in reality Muhammad was a victor of\nhearts, uniting a dispersed and ignorant people that\neven the Roman and Persian superpowers did not\nconsider governable, sowing the seeds of a civilisation that was to blossom spiritually, culturally, scientifically and morally.\nHow is it that a man who was illiterate manage to\ndeliver literature that taught us lessons in politics,\neconomics, history, law, science and morality...this\nliterature being the Quran...a book that is still recited 1400 years later and remains to be the only book\nin which if all copies were collected and thrown into\nthe sea, it would still be able to be reproduced to\nthe utmost perfection due to millions of worshippers\nmemorising it to the full stop. Why was it, then, that\nthe Almighty selected this man for such an honour?\nSo here we are - the inheritors of Muhammad. It\nremains for me to tell you what it was about him that\nfreed our hearts, and I therefore extend to you an\ninvitation to discover and to understand... \u201cMuhammad: Orphan that adopted the world\u201d. 6pm, 17th\nFebruary, Huxley LT308. Whether or not you are able\nto attend, you owe it to your intellect to know who he\nis and what this message is that he brought and to\nwhich he dedicated his incredible life.\n\u201cAnd We sent thee not, but as a Mercy to the\nworlds.\u201c\nUmair Aasem and Zara Hason\nBeautiful Warfare\nThe African Caribbean Society put on a stunning show\nAlan Liu\nIts creation definitely involved a kind of war-fare, but together, Imperial College\u2019s African\nCaribbean Society (ICACS) managed to create something truly beautiful. ICACS\u2019s 12th\nAfrogala, entitled \u201cBeautiful Warfare\u201d and\nperformed to a packed out Great Hall made an\notherwise dull weekend, truly memorable.\nI was privileged enough to watch this project\ngrow from planning to practice and finally to its\nfantastic execution. The showcase of African\nCaribbean music, dancing, acting and fashion\nwas all the more impressive having witnessed\nthe painstaking efforts and fierce commitment\nof the committee and the performers. Both the\nproduction team and performers were complete\nprofessionals, correcting technical difficulties,\nparticularly the issues experienced on the night\nwith sound, with calmness and speed.\nThe theme of Beautiful Warfare, a nod to the\nprejudice and inequality faced by African and\nCaribbean people in the past and, sadly, the\npresent, gave the evening a sense of continuity\nthat was maintained throughout the night. The\ncostumes, sets and marketing were all carefully\nand well designed in a military style. In fact,\nthe entire show was in keeping with the theme,\nwith the exception of one of the guest perform-ers. Nick Holmes\u2019 dancing, while impressive,\nwas a little bizarre: I overheard one audience\nmember commenting that his act was akin to\n\u201ctap dancing to lounge music\u201d.\nThe opening act; a step dance, was terrifyingly powerful. The performer\u2019s movement\ncreates the music, anyone who stepped out of\ntime would have ruined the act. However, each\nand every step and stamp was perfectly precise.\nThis is no mean accomplishment and is a testament to the skill of the choreographers Kem\nKatherine Bettany\nOnubogu and Tiffany Monu, considering that\nthere were four changeovers, 20 dancers, and\nmultiple complex and syncopated rhythms.\nMy favourite performance, however, was\nthat of Tobi Obisanya and the Afrogala Band,\nin their version of \u2018Destination Love\u2019. The\nband really could have been an authentic\njump blues band from New York in the 40s,\nand Obisanya\u2019s impersonation of Wyonie Harris was almost flawless. The choice of music\ndid play a big part in the success of the show.\nAfrican and Caribbean music and associated\ndance is a huge part of their culture: Beautiful\nWarfare celebrated its diversity with blues, hip\nhop, and authentic African dance. The stars of\nthe show were the Afrogala band, who completely blew me away with their authentic Afrobeat sound.\nThe overriding theme for me, though, was\nsummed up in the lyric: \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a\ncolour\u201d, sung by the talented Toyin Oni. Performing on stage were people from a multitude\nof backgrounds \u2013 but they share more than just\na skin colour. Their vibrancy, joie de vivre and\npride in their culture is infectious: at points the\nshow felt less like a performance and more like\na party that spilled out into the audience. I left\nthat night with a smile, and a new appreciation\nnot only for African Caribbean culture, but also\nfor their beauty and passion.\nSci-fi acolytes rejoice, Picocon returns!\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Society is\npreparing for its annual convention, Picocon,\ndue to take place on Saturday 19th February at\nthe Imperial College Union. Picocon has gone\nfrom strength to strength since it started in\n1984 and this year\u2019s event has all the makings\nof being one the best ones yet.\nPlanned activities include a quiz, silly games\nand the \u2018Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise\u2019.\nThe latter is a long held tradition Picocon and\noften involves liquid nitrogen and large sledge-hammers. This year the items being destroyed\ninclude a copy of the notorious \u201cStar Wars \u2013\nEwok Adventures\u201d and figurines of the mutated Tom Paris, from the much reviled Star Trek\nVoyager episode \u201cThreshold\u201d, and the Hulk\non a quad bike. Guests are also encouraged to\nbring their own contributions.\nIn addition, there will be stalls selling books\nand official Picocon T-shirt as well as a LAN\ntournament of Introversion\u2019s acclaimed game\nDEFCON. The company, which was founded\nby Imperial students, has donated three Introversion Anthology tins, containing their entire\ngame catalogue, which will be presented to the\nwinners.\nThe highlight of the day look set to be the\nthree guests of honour, who will be giving individual talks as well as participating in a group\npanel.

    "content": "FELIX 11\nSCIENCE\nSci-Fi Column\nSeeing how I\u2019ve been doing this for a\nfew weeks now I think it\u2019s high time I\ntackled one of the best known science\nfiction phenomena out there, Star Trek.\nThe franchise has been a massive success and even most people who aren\u2019t\nfans can recognise Captains Kirk and\nPicard. My favourite Star Trek show,\nhowever, is a bit more obscure than The\nOriginal Series or The Next Generation;\nit is, in fact, Star Trek Deep Space Nine.\nThe only Star Trek show set on a\nspace station, this allows it to have far\nlonger story arcs than those of its prede-cessors: the heroes couldn\u2019t simply fly\naway from the issue of the week at the\nend of an episode. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nsingle episode stories can still be very\ngood, as was shown by the brilliant Next\nGeneration, but personally I prefer the\nplot to be allowed to grow and develop.\nWhile it has nowhere near the depth of\nBabylon 5, which it was initially accused of copying, the overarching story\nis still very satisfying.\nAll of the Star Trek shows tried to\ncover serious issues but Deep Space\nNine does it the best. Who can forget\nthe powerful examination of the horrors\nof war in \u201cThe Siege of AR-558\u201d? The\nshow is also helped by very well de-veloped, and even morally ambiguous,\ncharacters. Gul Dukat is, in my opinion,\none of the best Star Trek villains ever:\nresponsible for the brutal occupation of\na peaceful alien planet yet strongly believing that what he is doing is right and\ncaring deeply for his daughter. Or take\nmy favourite character, Garak, a former\nspy and assassin who befriends and often helps many of the main cast and yet\ntortures the station\u2019s security chief when\nhe believes this is necessary to help his\npeople.\nThat is not to say that the show is without flaws. It has its fair share of tech-nobabble and stupid moments. In the\npilot episode, for example, the science\nofficer was asked by Captain Sisko to\nstudy an alien artefact he\u2019d been given.\nThis task simply consisted of repeating\nthe order to the computer and literally\ngoing to sleep for a few hours.\nThe acting was also often far from\nbrilliant. While some have praised Avery Brooks\u2019 portrayal of Sisko, to me it\nseems that he says most of his lines in a\ndull monotone. Nana Visitor and Rene\nAuberjonois are good at playing angry\nand gruff respectively, which is lucky\nas these are their characters\u2019 default\nstates, but terrible at portraying other\nemotions. Auberjonois\u2019 smile in \u201cThe\nSearch\u201d, when his character discovers\nother members of his species for the first\ntime, looks even more fake than Gordon\nBrown\u2019s, though admittedly this could\nhave been due to his makeup.\nThese issues, however, are all easily\nignored in the face of what is a truly\ngreat show.\nOrbit shift led to ancient methane increase\nAn investigation into the mysterious\nrise of methane levels in the atmosphere\nover the past 5,000 years has suggested\nits causes are natural, not anthropogenic.\nJoy Singarayer at the University of\nBristol and colleagues found the Earth\u2019s\nrotation, and not agriculture, is likely to\nbe to blame for the rise in atmospheric\nmethane concentration in an interglacial\nage known as the Holocene, which began around 10,000 years ago. The study\nundermines suggestions that humans\nand our agricultural activities were alone\nsufficient to influence these concentrations before the industrial era began.\nMethane is a greenhouse gas that can\nhang around in the atmosphere for up to\n15 years. Levels of atmospheric methane\nhave increased by approximately 150%\nover the last past two centuries as a result\nof human activity, such as agriculture,\ncoal mining, and the automotive industry.\nOver the latter half of the Holocene,\nthe concentration of methane in the atmosphere rose from 550 to 700 parts per\nbillion by volume. Whether this increase\nwas caused by human activity too, in the\nform of early rice cultivation and biomass burning, has been the subject of\nmuch debate. Methane measurements\ntaken from Greenland ice cores suggest the rise might have natural causes\ninstead, such as increased tropical and\nwetland emissions in response to the\nwarmer Holocene conditions.\nIn an attempt to show how the increase\nmight have been provoked by natural\ncauses such as these, Dr Singarayer and\ncolleagues reconstructed the ice core record using models of methane emissions\nfrom wetland and atmospheric concentrations caused by natural mechanisms\nover the last 130,000 years.\nThe results, published in Nature,\nmatched the methane measurements\nfrom the ice cores, indicating the increase in methane levels that began mid-Holocene were a result of the Earth\u2019s\norbit, alongside increased methane\nemissions from wetlands in the Southern\nHemisphere, particularly South America, caused by weather patterns provoked\nby small shifts in the Earth\u2019s rotational\naxis. Most importantly, the findings capture the pattern of decline in methane\nA new hypothesis about the lifelong hallucinations of romantic composer Frederic Chopin suggests he suffered from\ntemporal lobe epilepsy. New research\npublished in the journal Medial Humanities made this diagnosis based on\neyewitness accounts of Chopin\u2019s friends\nand family describing his hallucinatory\nepisodes.\nChopin was known to have ill health\nthroughout his life, such as fever, nasal blockage and recurrent coughing of\nblood. However, his hallucinations were\ncommonly attributed to his sensitive nature as a creative genius rather than any\nneurological or psychiatric disorder.\nThe researchers, led by Manuel\nVasquez Caruncho of Xeral-Calde Hospital in Lugo Spain, compiled data from\nletters, memoirs, and accounts that revealed some common characteristics\nof Chopin\u2019s hallucinations. They most\ncommonly occurred in the evening and\nwere sometimes the accompaniment of\nacute infections and fever. Chopin was\nable to recall them in great detail but he\nwould often become detached from reality during an episode. He suffered from\ncomplex visual hallucinations, in particular Lilliputian hallucinations, where\nthe people and images appear smaller\nthan they are in reality.\nChopin himself recounts an occasion\nwhere these Lilliputian images forced\nhim to leave the room while playing his\nSonata in B flat minor: \u201cSuddenly, I saw\nemerging from the half-open case of my\npiano those cursed creatures.\u201d Death was\na recurrent theme of his hallucinations.\nHallucinations are a common symptom of psychiatric conditions such as\nbipolar disorder, major depression and\nschizophrenia. However, hallucinations\nas a result of these are mostly auditory\nin nature and so could be ruled out of the\nresearchers\u2019 diagnosis.\nHowever, temporal lobe epilepsy is a\ntype of focal epilepsy, where only part\nof the brain is affected by seizures, and\nis known to produce complex visual\nhallucinations. In some cases small animals and people have been reported,\nwhich is consistent with Chopin\u2019s Lilliputian hallucinations. This epilepsy is\nalso sometimes preceded by psychiatric\nsymptoms such as anxiety, depression\nand sleeplessness, conditions Chopin\nMysterious Chopin list of brain disorders\nThea Cunningham\nPolly Bennett\nMaciej Matuszewski\nemissions in the first 5,000 years of the\nHolocene that preceded the increase in\nthe later half of the period. The team believes the change in methane levels between these two halves is a result of differences between the size and rate of the\nSun\u2019s solar radiation, along with a lack\nof glacial ice in the Holocene period.\nThough the findings suggest we ought\nnot to point the finger at early agriculture for a rise in methane concentrations\nbefore the industrial era, there are still\nconcerns about how the feedback of\nmethane in the atmosphere may amplify\nglobal warming. In light of this, further\nresearch is needed to investigate methane cycles so that we can better understand the release of methane and its involvement with global warming.\nFriday 11 february 2011\noften commented that he suffered from.\nHe was also a known insomniac. Finally,\nand consistently with the characteristics\nof temporal lobe epilepsy, Chopin\u2019s hallucinations lasted from seconds to min-utes, making the case for epilepsy as his\ncause of hallucinations convincing.\nMethane emissions from wetlands are increasing \u2013 well done wetlands Scientists, like this one holding his big rod, are measuring methane levels\nNo photochopin here \u2013 the composer was known to have hallucinations\n\n"

However, some cutting runs forward by Eddie Fitzpatrick and Donal Connolly\nwere boosted by sterling defending from\nold hands Ed O\u2019Hare and Andy Lavery\nand man-of-the-match William Seez,\nand Imperial soon found themselves\nenjoying the majority of the possession\nin front of the Cambridge posts. Some\nlapses in concentration led to some\nwell-taken points and two easy goals for\nCambridge.\nA potential third was blocked at short\nrange by keeper Harry Evans and in\nspite of the strong wind his deep kick-outs found their way to Sean Dunne and\nEddie Fitz who recorded a goal and two\npoints between them in the first half.\nDunne eventually picked up the three-pointer after continuously beating his\nman to the ball. A flurry of goalmouth\nscrambles around John McGuckin were\neventually cleared leaving Imperial\ntrailing by four points at half-time on a\nscore-line of 2-3 to 1-2.\nThe second half started well for Imperial with midfield duo Finian McCann\nand Donal Connolly combining to win\nthe throw-in. With the wind at their\nbacks, Imperial really began to move\nthe ball quickly into Dunne and Conn\nO\u2019Rourke with Dunne starting the scoring for the half with a goal and a point.\nCambridge briefly held possession near\nthe Imperial end before McCann received the ball just inside the Cambridge\nhalf to duly launch the ball over the bar\nfrom fifty-five yards. With O\u2019Hare, Lavery, Ben Ryder and debutant James Shanahan blunting the Cambridge attack,\nImperial had now found a comfortable\nrhythm as Dunne, Connolly and Mike\nWhite scored points. A fortuitous goal\nfrom Fitzpatrick was followed by another from O\u2019Hare off the back of some\npowerful forward drives. Cambridge\nstruck back however against the run of\nplay to smash home a goal off the crossbar and then another barely two minutes\nlater. With ten minutes remaining the\nscore stood at 4-7 to 4-3 in favour of\nImperial as Cambridge looked ready to\ncause an upset.\nBe that as it was, Imperial dug deep\nand half-time addition Francis O\u2019Neill\nmade some great runs forward from\nfull back to let the midfield diamond\nof O\u2019Hare, McCann, Connolly and Fitz\ncontrol the remainder of the match, reinforced by the muscle of Seez. After a\nlong burst from McCann and a beautifully curled point from the boot of Fitzpatrick, IC were replied to by a final\nscore for Cambridge. After intercepting and dispossessing a string of short\nCambridge kickouts, Imperial killed off\nthe game with points for McCann and\nO\u2019Rourke and yet another major from\nSean Dunne, leaving the final score Imperial 5-11 (26 points) Cambridge 4-4\n(16 points).\nThe very encouraging display from\nthe Boys in (darker) Blue was celebrated\nto the tune of the finest \u2018odes to\u2019 alongside much cider and flowing champagne\nafter the victory.\nEd Fitzpatrick\nGaelic Sports:\nCambridge fall\nto Imperial for a\nsecond year\n\n"

    "content": "17\nfelix\nCOMMENT\nB\nefore even thinking about\nthe \u2018special\u2019 Valentine\u2019s\nDay edition of Felix I can,\nwith a certainty of about\n99.99% say that we will\nbe reading loads of complaints about it\nbeing just another one of those capitalist holidays. I both agree and disagree\nwith this \u2013 Valentine\u2019s Day shouldn\u2019t be\na \u2018holiday\u2019\u2013 especially since I happen to\ndislike chocolates. You should show the\npeople you care for that you do so every\nday of the year.\nThe last two Valentine\u2019s Days are the\nonly ones I can still remember quite\nwell and both were spent with my best\nfriend(s). One of them was visiting me\nin London back in 2009 and last year I\nwent home for a gig by one of my favourite ex-Yugo rock bands. You see,\nValentine\u2019s Day is no special thing in\nthat part of the world \u2013 it happens to be\njust another day in February that comes\nand goes just like any other. You get the\nodd western fanatic that celebrates it\nwith his girlfriend as a \u201ctribute of their\nlove\u201d, but in reality, those same people\nbreak up less than a month after (and\nthen get back together again, only to\nMatt Colvin\nbreak up yet another time\u2026gosh, make\nup your minds!).\nMoreover, heart-shaped chocolate boxes\nand flowers are not sold more on the\n14th of February than on any other day.\nI also still haven\u2019t noticed the clich\u00e9d\nred roses being delivered everywhere I\ngo (nevertheless, these happen to be my\nfavourite flowers).\nNow, I did not always live in Sarajevo\nand you all know what happens when\nyou start digging up your shoebox of\nprimary school memories \u2013 the best and\nworst (read: most embarrassing) stories\ncome up. The same thing happened this\ntime when I dug up a folded red heart\nshaped \u201cSecret Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d card I\nhappened to receive when I was 7.\nBack then, I was in 2nd grade of an Elementary School near Boston and well,\nour teacher thought it would be amusing\nto assign us all to be someone\u2019s secret\nValentine. She told each of us to make a\ncreative gift or card for a certain person.\nI still remember being seated on the floor\nand Ms Quillen handing out each of our\ngifts to the designated valentine. Once\nshe\u2019d hand it out, she\u2019d reveal to us the\nname of our Secret Valentine. My name\ncame up and in a matter of seconds I was\nholding the biggest heart-shaped card\nwith \u201cYou are my Valentine\u201d written in\nwhite childish writing on the outside and\nthe classical love poem inside:\nRoses are Red,\nViolets are Blue,\nThis Valentine may supposedly be\nsecret,\nBut I truly do love you.\nAnd alas, to top that, my crush happened\nto be the one whose hands made that\ncard. He had deep blue eyes and exceptionally white teeth \u2013 something I admire up to this day. He was a bit chubby\n\u2013 but we all know how cute that can be.\nI think my cheeks turned as red as that\ncard (it certainly felt so).\nAnyways, back to the point \u2013 Valentine\u2019s happens to be just another day of\nthe year and if you do happen to want\nto share a special day with someone you\nlove \u2013 friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, family member or pet, don\u2019t hesitate to do\nso. Maybe they might write an article\nin Felix 14 years after wondering where\nyou happen to be in the world.\nT\nhe tabloids and I, we\u2019ve\nhad a chequered past to\nsay the least. I grew up on\na diet of the Daily Mail,\nyet it wasn\u2019t until the merits of secondary education that I realised what I was fervently devouring\nwasn\u2019t exactly all that wholesome. As\nI began to write more and more, something clicked. The whinging, the constant references to burdened taxpayers,\nthe preference for introspective scandal\nrather than global issues. Bias pervaded in the language, and it really didn\u2019t\ntaste very good.\nYet still I read on. But now, I wasn\u2019t\nfurthering my knowledge about the\nlatest figures on immigration, nay,\nnot even the cancer risks from writing\nweighty comment pieces on Word 2003.\nIt was about my criticism of journalistic\nattitudes, the lack of cited sources, the\nopinionated letters with bad attitudes.\nSubsequently I grew up and stopped,\nsettling down with the infinitely more\nfriendly local news. Finally, I had got\nout of the game.\nThen everything changed. The Daily\nMail\u2019s exposure of Imperial\u2019s wild ways\nin combination with the sudden trend of\ncomedians taking potshots at Mail readers peaked my curiosity in the standards\nof tabloids today. It was time to lay my\nNaida Dzigal\ndemons to rest once and for all. It was\ntime to return to the newsagents.\nThe front page of the Mail. A sizeable photo of Pete Doherty and his latest\nmisdemeanours dominate proceedings.\nThen I find it, in the miniscule column\nto the bottom left, \u201cBloodbath on streets\nof Cairo\u201d. Flicking through the pages, I\nget the feeling that a great deal of meanness remains. Physical imperfections of\nfemale celebrities are pored over, grisly\nfox attacks packaged with gory images\nin full technicolour. Outwardly, the paper\u2019s a morally upstanding citizen, yet\ninside it\u2019s filthy minded. Ah, here we\nare, \u201cCAMEL WARRIORS IN BATTLE OF CAIRO\u201d.\nSeriously, what\u2019s next? Shootout at\nthe Great Pyramid? Aquatic pursuit on\nthe Nile? The potential to form a tenuous link with Egypt for the benefit of\nreaders is endless! My venture back to\nthe Mail left me disappointed. I was no\nmore critical of it than I had been. I had\nto go deeper. Beyond DiCaprio, if you\nlike. I needed The Sun.\nLike a 9 year old sycophantic schoolboy who\u2019s just discovered naughty\nwords, The Sun uneasily mixes sensationalist and populist stories with outward political allegiance. Raoul Moat\ndominates the front cover, for some reason.A\u2018pal\u2019of Mel Gibson reveals his innermost thoughts. David Camer\u2013 whoa,\nan article on cider branding! Look out\nladies; they\u2019re bringing out pear cider\nespecially for your delicate taste buds!\nSorry, it even suckered me in. I can\u2019t\nfind any other word to describe it but\npropaganda; the simplistic language, the\nwell documented history of switching\npolitical support. Printed letters praise\nthe Coalition to the skies. Someone suggests Jeremy Clarkson would be better\nas Prime Minister. I cry inside.\nBecause that\u2019s what genuinely worries me. While the Mail has a dedicated\ncore readership with unchanging traditionalist values, it\u2019s people like Rupert\nMurdoch, owner of The Sun and a bevy\nof other publications, who can easily\nmould the opinions of so many readers.\nAt least I can rest back into the warm\nembrace of local news when it all gets\ntoo much. Whereas I might have had to\ndeal with secret perverts and schoolchildren in the past, forever fixated on the\nnegative, local papers are like a trip to\na kindly elderly relative, where I know\nI\u2019m going to get a hot drink and a slice of\nhomemade cake. One headline tells me\nthat, \u201cLOCAL JOURNALISTS VISIT\nSCHOOL TO HELP WRITE PUNCHY\nHEADLINES\u201d. Aw, bless \u2018em. They\nmight not get it right all the time, but my\nword, they care.\nFalling out of love with tabloids\n\u201cMy name came\nup and in a matter\nof seconds I was\nholding the biggest\nheart-shaped card.\u201d\nFive reasons girls\nshould ask guys out\nfor a change\nPuppy love. No, not that kind\n1. Imperial man syndrome.\nA guy having the nerve to ask\nyou out doesn\u2019t necessarily\nmean that he\u2019s \u2018brave\u2019. It could\nequally mean that he\u2019s an arrogant arsehole. I know loads of\nguys who would probably treat\nyou better than the drunk jock\u2013\ntype that just reused a \u2018never\nthat good in the first place\u2019\nchat-up line on you. They\u2019re just\ntoo nervous to ask you.\n2. Equality.\nYou, rightly, demand equal pay\nand for the right to have kids\nwithout your job suffering. You\nalso expect to be asked out\nall the time and have your dinners paid for. Feminist it is not.\nYou\u2019re paid decently now, so\nyou can (in theory) afford that\nswanky meal.\n3. Share the burden.\nGetting rejected sucks, whether\nyou know the person, or you\ntake a chance on a good\u2013looking guy dancing near you on a\nFriday night. Either way, when\nthey give you that awkward look\nand make a good/bad excuse,\nor simply tell the truth, you want\nto bury your head in a tub of\nHaagen-Dazs. I know I\u2019m not exactly selling it, but think about\nhow many times the average\nman (if they have the nerve in\nthe first place) go through that.\nLetting them do it alone borders on cruelty. So share the\nburden \u2013 ask him out.\n4. Don\u2019t wait around.\nOkay, so you\u2019re waiting for a\nguy to ask you out. What if he\u2019s\nnot your type? What if none of\nthem are?

    "content": "The role that women play in the alleviation of poverty is becoming increasingly\napparent in development research. In a\nsad irony, it is also increasingly clear\nthat they bear the majority of the burden of this same poverty. The figures are\nalarming \u2013 women work two thirds of\nthe world\u2019s working hours but directly\nearn just 10% of the world\u2019s income \u2013\nmoney which they are more likely to\nspend on education and food for their\nchildren than their male counterparts.\nWomen also make up 70% of the world\u2019s\npoorest people and are underrepresented\nin society from classrooms to politics\n(holding just 19% of the world\u2019s parliamentary seats).\nTo address these gaping gender im-balances, the UN set up UNIFEM in\n1976 to directly tackle gender discrimi-nation, primarily through working with\nother UN organisations such as UNICEF and other official aid groups. By\n2006, the body had a budget of over\n$200 million and was present in 80\ncountries and yet it was slammed by the\nUN itself as being \u201cincoherent, fragmented and under- resourced\u201d. This\nJanuary, in light of this criticism and\nnew evidence regarding the importance\nof women in development, the UN created UN Women; a new centralised\nbody with a much larger budget and\nmore political clout. Just this week the\nmonth old body called a press conference for student journalists to make a\nplea for help \u2013 they were already un-derfunded, receiving about a quarter of\nthe funding desired; effectively giving\nthem the same budget as the old UNIFEM. Their solution was clear: more\nfunding. But does international aid actually deliver results? This is a question\ntoo often brushed aside as heartless \u2013\nhow on earth could someone question\nthe noble aims of aid? And yet, noble\nthough the aims may be, the results are\noften staggeringly far from those prom-ised. This article will look at the case\nagainst international aid and argue that\nwe should have fewer, not more, bodies\nlike UN Women.\nThe chief justification for international aid is that poor countries are stuck in\na poverty trap. That is, if they only had\nthe basic resources to start things off\nthey could work their own way out from\nthere. The argument then follows that\nunless wealthy countries give poorer\nones aid, they will never escape poverty.\nThis seems to be backed up with evidence as the poorest fifth of the world\u2019s\ncountries had much lower growth from\n1985-2001 than the other 4 fifths; just\nPOLITICS\nFELIX 15\nFemale empowerment to save the world\n\u201cWomen hold just\n19% of the world\u2019s\nparliamentary seats\u201d\naid for political reasons, thus discounting the possibility of aid being simply a\nresponse to slow growth. According to\nBoone, it seems that aid promotes consumption but not investment.\nSo, what makes countries stay poor?\nThey don\u2019t. Or at least, they are just\nas capable of good growth rates as any\nother country, once you allow for bad\ngovernment. It is possible to control for\nbad government in the data above by\nusing indexes on corruption and democ-racy, the oldest such indexes compiled\nsince 1984 by the International Country\nRisk Guide and Polity VI, a project of\nthe University of Maryland. Using these\nindexes to statistically control for bad\ngovernment (those with high corruption\nand low democracy ratings), it becomes\nclear that it is bad government that keeps\npoor countries poor, not a poverty trap\nas those with good governments enjoy\nsimilar growth rates to their wealthier\ncounterparts.\nBut why is it that external NGOs fail to\npromote growth, acting separately to local and potentially corrupt government?\nToo often, they are not there to fulfil the\nneeds of the poor but rather those of the\n0.2% compared to the wealthier countries\u2019 1.3%. Poor countries seem to stay\npoor because they are poor in the first\nplace.\nBut a closer look at the statistics reveals a different story. Firstly, over the\nlonger period from 1950 to 2001, the\npoorest fifth of countries increased their\naverage income 2.25 fold which is statistically indistinguishable from the increase in income of the richest four fifths\nof 2.47 fold. The reason for the gap in\ngrowth in the period 1985-2001 (a period of much higher international aid) is\nthat the countries in the bottom fifth kept\nchanging \u2013 strong evidence that in fact\ncountries aren\u2019t doomed to be trapped in\npoverty. This data excludes Soviet and\nPersian Gulf oil producing countries as\nspecial cases.\nWas it aid that caused these countries\nto break out of the bottom fifth? No,\ncountries with above average aid performed no better than those with below\naverage aid. While it is of course possible that aid is given in response to low\ngrowth and so hardly causes it, these\ndata (compiled by Peter Boone of the\nLSE) look only at countries receiving\nRory Fenton\nwealthy country donors. The emotive\nimages of those suffering from AIDS\ncauses foreign governments, urged by\ntheir citizens, to donate money to buy\nantiretroviral drugs for poor countries.\nHowever, research shows that for every\nyear of life given to an AIDS patient,\nthe same money could provide between\n75 and 1,500 years of life through a focus on prevention. A Western focus on\nschool enrolment (one of the UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals) means\nthat investment in actual school supplies\nis overlooked, when such investment is\nestimated to be 14 times more effective\nthan simply building new schools. If\nthe poor were in charge, these wrongs\nwould surely be righted but when international aid is accountable only to do-nors, this is unlikely to ever be the case.\nBut this does not mean that aid is hope-less, far from it. The success of schemes\nbased on microfinance show that aid can\nmake a difference. But this aid should\nnot come in the form of large, multinational plans to \u2018end poverty\u2019. The history of aid has shown that these grand\nschemes simply do not work beyond\nthe great concerts and the well meaning wristbands. Rather, small projects\nthat work with and empower the poor\nthemselves can make a real difference.\nCouldn\u2019t the poor be given some kind of\naid vouchers to let them decide how the\nmoney is spent? Highly centralised aid\nis exactly the kind of solution to poverty\nthat we would never wish on ourselves\nand not only is it patronising and unac-countable, it doesn\u2019t work.\nOrganisations like the new UN Women could learn a lot from this. It is simply preposterous to tackle \u2018all forms of\ngender discrimination\u2019 in one go. Much\nbetter to look at particular areas where\noutside funding and expertise can make\na real difference. Ditch the grand plans\nand seek piecemeal changes in a way\nthat is both accountable to local people\nand uses their own expertise. It is possible to end poverty, for both men and\nwomen, but not in one big go.\nDo you give to charity? Well you just burned Africa you lefty-liberal jerk!\nBut is the U.N.\u2019s newest agency\u2019s plan to end gender inequality and poverty in one\nfell swoop just more of the same?\nAmanda Diez\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 23\nARTS\nGet hot\nat pole\ndancing\nclass\nApparently, Imperial is one of the few\nuniversities in the country not to already\nhave a pole dancing society (I wonder\nwhy\u2026). Even Cambridge University\nis better catered for! Given the growing interest in all forms of erotic dancing\n\u2013 the much hyped Burlesque the movie\nhas recently been released \u2013 and the shift\nin emphasis from XXX to exercise, it\nseemed a good time to find out whether\nwe should think about starting one\u2026\nHaving rounded up a substantial proportion of the female students in fourth\nyear Physics (and Chem Eng) we decided on a pre-Valentine\u2019s taster session at\nthe shiny Riverside Studios in Hammersmith run by the Pole Dancing School\nA word of warning: the School insists\non short shorts, bare legs and high heels,\neven for the taster class. This is not for\nthe faint-hearted in the middle of British winter! Fortunately we were all girls\ntogether with legs of varying shades\nof pasty \u2013 thank god, since I had come\ndown with a heavy cold and couldn\u2019t\nhave looked less sexy if I\u2019d tried.\nOur instructor was the actual founder of the whole school and Miss Pole\nDance World 2005! Elena is classically\ntrained as a ballet dancer and it showed\nin her gorgeous figure and total poise.\nShe took up pole dancing as part of her\nrehabilitation following a serious car accident and says she immediately loved\nit. Watching her demonstrate some of\nthe amazing gymnastics she could do\nI shall be open here, I\u2019m not sure how\nto review a comedian. Does it suffice to\nsay that Alun Cochrane was hilarious?\nDo I have any hope of conveying the\nhumour of his jokes by retelling them\nhere? The answer, I suspect, to both\nthese questions is no, so I shall give it\na go. He\u2019s a Yorkshire comedian, with a\nnumber of television appearances under\nhis belt, and took delight in lampooning\nthe audience\u2019s middle-class sensibilities:\nhe ends a joke about cooking by nonchalantly whipping out the phrase \u201chacher\u201d\nbefore turning it on the audience when\nthey laugh in recognition.\nThat said, there was something uncomfortable about his set; as if he\u2019s not\nentirely on the ball. At times his pauses\nare perhaps a little too long to be deliberate and his joke about wasting much\nof his time staring out of windows, is\nlingered on awkwardly; he gazes out at\nthe street as if trying to spot his thoughts\nflagging a taxi down.\nBut I'm probably being too harsh. My\nchest was heaving with laughter and\nhe had the audience positively howling\nat times. However, The Royal Albert\nHall\u2019s Elgar Room itself is starting to\nget on my nerves. It adapts to all types\nof performance so effortlessly and naturally that one wonders if it isn't a bit\nsmug about it all.\nThe room, which has seen a variety of\nmusic from the twee Johnny Flynn to the\nmind-pummelling Factory Floor, was\nfilled with cabaret-style seating, adorned\nwith couples giggling into their wine \u2013\n'robustly' priced wine at that \u2013 and falling into each other with laughter. After\nsending the paper to print, and uploading the articles to the website, finding\nChristina Flanagan\nKadhim Shubber\non a pole made me wish it was easier to\nwatch this kind of performance outside\nof a strip club. A quick search online\ndidn\u2019t turn up many pole dance venues,\nbut there is a good range of burlesque\nshows in London.\nOur session started with Kondi-style\nwarm up exercises and very quickly progressed onto having a go with the poles\nthemselves. We learnt Fireman Spin\n(leap on and twizzle round and round),\nPole Slide, Swan Slide (sliding with your\nlegs kicked out behind) and Sitting Hold\n(just sitting knees-bent half-way up the\npole a bit like a pole dancing genie),\nmastering them with extremely varying\ndegrees of success! The main problems\nwere sweaty hands sliding off the pole\nwhich led to knees hitting the floor at\nspeed, and in extremely grippy thighs,\nwhich didn\u2019t allow for any spinning!\nTowards the end of the class we even\nmanaged to put it all together in a routine set to music that involved lots of\nsexy walking around the pole and standing \u2018seductively\u2019, hand on hip. This was\nmaybe my favourite part since Elena\nhad excellent tips on posture and style,\nwhich are actually valuable far beyond\nthe world of pole dancing.\nBut they are not kidding about the fitness aspect! Days later my thighs are\nstill aching and it is hard to raise my\narms above my head. The most important requirement seems to be upper body\nstrength and couldn\u2019t help wondering\nif pole dancing might actually be more\nsuited to men, although the visual im-myself in such a rarefied environment\nwas deeply relaxing.\nLuckily, Alun Cochrane\u2019s sanity rescuing performance is only the first in\na new series of comedy shows at the\nRoyal Albert Hall. Looking ahead, on\nthe 16th of March the rapper-turned-comedian Doc Brown takes the stage\nand on the 28th of April \u2013 they do like to\nspace them out, don\u2019t they? \u2013 Alex Zane\nwill join his compatriots in playing one\nof the swankiest comedy gigs, probably\nin the country.\nSlowly, bit by bit, creeping along at an\nelderly snail\u2019s pace, Kensington is be-If laughter be the food of love, hear here\n\u201cHe had the audience\npositively howling at\ntimes.\u201d\npact of all the pretty twizzling would be\nsomewhat lost.\nWe had a really fabulous, funny girls\u2019\nnight out and despite the many bruises\nwe\u2019re all very happy to have given it a go.\nMaybe soon there will be poles set-up in\nthe UDH for an evening, but otherwise\nPole Dancing School runs tasters and\nbeginners courses all over London, as do\nseveral other dance schools which can be\nfound easily online. At \u00a315 for an hour\nit\u2019s a pretty costly exercise class, but at\nleast half of us would seriously consider\ngetting lessons in the future \u2013 we\u2019ll just\nhave to wait for a good deal on Groupon!\nCourses can be booked from\nbeginner to \u2018addict\u2019 level:\nwww.poledancingschool.com\nA pole-dancing class gets warmed up at the Hammersmith pole-dancing school. This is serious exercise people\nginning to offer some entertainment for\nits residents. If you include The Builder\u2019s Arms\u2019 comedy night on Monday\nthen who knows, Albertopolis might be\nturning into quite the stand-up comedy\ndestination \u2013 well perhaps I may have\nstretched myself a bit there. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re free on the 16th of March,\nI\u2019ll see you at Elgar Comedy \u2013 we can\nshare a table!\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

The squad was in a confident\nmood however, being unbeaten in the\nleague, and knowing that a win would\ntake them to the top of the table for the\nfirst time in the season.\nGiven their opponent\u2019s position towards the foot of the table, Imperial\nopted for an aggressive three-five-two\nformation. This very nearly produced\na goal in the opening exchanges of the\nmatch, with Robinson firing a low cross\nto strike partner Eshun, who rattled the\npost with an audacious first-time effort\nfrom the edge of the box.\nThis set the tone for the rest of the\nfirst half, and Imperial didn\u2019t have to\nwait long for an opener, with Eshun\ndoing well to control and then convert\nBeswetherick\u2019s cross, in a crowded penalty area. Imperial continued to dominate proceedings, with the back three\nseemingly untroubled by the occasional\nRUMS long ball. Five minutes before\nthe break, the lead was doubled when a\ndelicate, if wind assisted, through ball\nfrom Benincasa found Robinson, who\nkept his head to coolly finish the one on\none.\nWith the very real chance that positions at the top of the league will be decided on goal difference, the emphasis at\nhalf-time was placed on maintaining the\nintensity of the first half, and the squad\nwas determined not to repeat the previous week\u2019s feat of squandering a two\ngoal lead.

Sometimes I get less than 30 e-mails over-night, on a Monday morning it can be well over\n100 though, I think I once received 300 e-mails\nover a weekend! I\u2019ll generally have 2 or 3 meetings a day which can be with Union staff, with\nstudents or with College depending on what I\u2019m\nworking on and the rest of the time I\u2019ll try and\nkeep up with all the e-mail/phone calls coming in\nas well as getting on with some more long-term\nprojects. I try not to leave at the end of the day\nuntil I have fewer than 30 flagged e-mails left as I\ndon\u2019t like keeping people waiting but sometimes\nit\u2019s just not possible!\nWhat do you enjoy most about your job?\nIt sounds really cheesy and cliched but it\u2019s definitely the sense of satisfaction from knowing that\nin some small, or not so small way, you\u2019ve made\na real difference to people\u2019s lives every single day.\nIt\u2019s also great to be thanked which happens pleasantly often. The other fun part is getting to have\nreally interesting discussions with people in College about why things are done in a particular way\nand how to get the best deal for students \u2013 on the\nwhole College are happy to help but often don\u2019t\nknow how!\nWhat do you enjoy least?\nThere are some pretty tedious parts of the job. The\n100th time you\u2019ve answered the same question requires a lot of patience and you have to tell yourself that they wouldn\u2019t ask if it was clear so making\nit clearer for everyone should be your main prior-ity. Also room booking approval can be a fairly\ndull process but again, it\u2019s important for someone\nto have oversight over what\u2019s going on so it\u2019s important to mix it in with the more fun stuff to stop\nyourself getting frustrated.\nWhat is your biggest regret so far?\nI really do regret that I forgot to put giant maps up\nat Freshers\u2019 Fair, there were still plenty of maps\nbut it was frustrating as it was something I\u2019d meant\nto do and then forgot! Generally any time I forget\nto deal with a student\u2019s problem, or I could have\nsolved it but didn\u2019t get round to it in time. Those\nkinds of things make me pretty depressed.\nDo you have any advice for anyone considering\nrunning for your position?\nIt\u2019s a pretty high stress position. You often have to\nwork very long hours so you need to be comfortable with that and also get used to the idea that the\nUnion will steal your life; it will almost certainly\ntake over large parts of your social life. Also, it often requires a LOT of patience and being able to\nmulti-task is pretty useful. That said, it\u2019s amazingly\nrewarding and challenging.\nHave you delivered your manifesto promises?\nSome but not all of them, however at the same time\nI think I made the best decisions for clubs \u2013 manifestos shouldn\u2019t be set in stone. The two major\npromises I didn\u2019t keep were a) a buddy system for\nstruggling clubs \u2013 which when I asked clubs about\nthey overwhelmingly said they wouldn\u2019t find use-ful, and b) searchable inventories which has been\nput on hold to allow an online club finance system\nto be developed, something that the Clubs & Societies Board said would be much more helpful for\nclub officers.\nWhat will be the most important challenge for\nyour successor?\nI would say it\u2019s whatever they make it; everyone\ncomes to the role wanting to achieve something\ndifferent. I guess if there is anything then perhaps\nthey\u2019ll have to finally work out a fairer system for\nbooking rooms as we\u2019re getting to the point where\nsaturation of certain space types is occurring.\nW\nhat has been your biggest\nchallenge?\nThe biggest challenge in my\nrole is definitely the constant\nbattle to provide students with\nall the services they want. It\u2019s tough to not be able\nto cater for everyone, or when you put plans in\nplace to do so, it takes time to mature. Ultimately,\nI\u2019ve realised that it\u2019s not possible to please every-one, but the best that you can do is try and be fair to\nas many people as possible.\nWhat is an average day like?\nI get to the office at either 9am or 10am, depending\non how busy my day is. Mondays and Tuesdays\ntend to be the busiest as I\u2019ve got quite a few meetings and obviously I\u2019m constantly dealing with\nday-to-day issues with services in the Union and\nalso financial issues with Clubs & Societies. There\nare a lot of forms to sign and regular meetings I attend to help steer the Union\u2019s customer service, and\nvarious internal projects.\nWhat have you enjoyed most about your job?\nThe thing that I\u2019ve enjoyed most this year is the\nlaunch of Metric and FiveSixEight. The Union has\nchanged so dramatically since I was a 1st year and\nbeing able to contribute to that positive change has\nbeen really fun. I\u2019m really proud to be a part of the\nbeginning of what is sure to be an incredible next\nfew years with regards to our commercial services.\nAll these venues are sure to play a key role in our\nplans for the Summer Ball 2011.\nWhat have you enjoyed least?\nI guess it\u2019s the flip-side of that same coin. The delays and hiccups with the club and bar were really\nfrustrating. Mostly because there\u2019s a limit to what\nyou can do when, for example, you find asbestos.\nBut I think in the grand scheme of things, they\nwere just little road-bumps. We\u2019ve picked up well\nsince the launch, and are in fact doing better than\nwe originally thought.\nWhat is your biggest regret so far?\nI\u2019m not sure if I would call it a regret, but I wish I\nhad known how long it takes to get things changed\naround the Union. Sometimes is can be quite de-moralising when you come into work and you are\nfaced with the same issues as a few weeks ago. The\nkey is to stay focused on the bigger picture. If you\nget bogged down in petty issues, you can miss important milestones in the projects you have started\nwhich are here to improve the student experience.\nDo you have any advice for anyone considering\nrunning for your position?\nIf you\u2019re thinking of running for Deputy President\n(Finance & Services), I would talk to Club chairs\nand treasurers, and learn how the union finance\nsystem works. The more experience you can get\nand the more you can prepare yourself, the better.\nThe system can be a bit daunting at a first glance,\nbut once you understand it, it\u2019s very easy and ef-ficient. I would also advise going over to the Reynolds building on Charing Cross campus. It\u2019s one of\nICU\u2019s commercial outlets, and has in the past been\noverlooked. It really does help if you can talk to as\nmany students who are active in the Union\u2019s operations to get a better understanding of the culture\nand procedures involved.\nHave you delivered your manifesto promises?\nI promised quite a lot of things and I think I have\ndelivered on most of them. Of course, I can\u2019t take\nall the credit for those, the Union has been improving on so many fronts over previous years and obviously Metric and FiveSixEight were begun before I was a sabb. But the only promise that I think\nI haven\u2019t managed to deliver is a cashless payment\nsystem for the bars; it turned out to be unworkable.\nWhat will be the most important challenge for\nyour successor?\nI think that my successor has to ensure that Metric\nand FiveSixEight remain responsive to the needs\nof students. We need to keep helping Clubs & Societies put on nights in Metric and make sure that\nwe don\u2019t let the time, effort and money invested in\nthe refurbishment go to waste. They also need to\ncontinue the work that has begun to revolutionise\nour club finance system. It\u2019s a big task and we\u2019re\nreaching the end of it but it will fall to my successor to follow it through to the very end.\nRavi Pall\nDeputy President\n(Finances & Services)\n\u201cIt often requires a lot of\npatience and being able to\nmulti-task is pretty useful.\nThat said, it\u2019s amazingly rewarding and challenging.\u201d\nYou\u2019re going to need a lot of patience\nWith elections starting on Tuesday, Felix talks to the Sabbs about their experiences\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\u201cThe key is to stay focused\non the bigger picture. If\nyou get bogged down in\npetty issues, you can miss\nimportant milestones\u201d\nLook at how happy she is to be interviewed \u201cHahaha, what money?\u201d\n\n"

Instead of going for an overtly upbeat theme,\n\u2018She Waits\u2019 is in contrast a groove infused\nwith subtle melodies that with repeated listens become infectious. It is intentionally less\nquirky than say \u2018Radio Ladio\u2019 and the synths\nDarling Marling\nChapel Club\nPalace\nLoog Records\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nThe darker 80\u2019s sounds of The Smiths, Joy\nDivision, and Echo and the Bunnymen have\nL\naura Marling is a remarkable artist.\nShe left home at 16 and moved to\nLondon carrying, you would like to\nimagine, only a guitar, a straw hat\nand a few vinyls. She then befriended \u2013 remarkably, given her shyness \u2013 members\nof lightweight-campfire-singalong bands Noah\nand the Whale and, later, Mumford and Sons.\nMost people will have noticed her first singing\ncutesy backing vocals on Mystery Jets\u2019 \u2018Young\nLove\u2019 and Noah\u2019s \u20185 Years Time\u2019 and would\nhave rightly thought her a songstress of little\nsubstance. However, delve even slightly into\nany of her solo work and you will notice a complete transformation. No longer is she the na\u00efve\nposter girl of such hollow genres as \u201cindie-folk\u201d\nor \u201cnu-folk\u201d but rather a songwriter of (almost)\nthe highest quality who contemplates womanhood and the hazards of love rather than sunny\ndays at the zoo. That is not to say that childlike,\nhappy songs are bad: sunny days at the zoo are\nsome of the happiest memories of my life. However, anyone can write a catchy tune about the\nsun, but it takes great talent to sing about love\nand sadness without clich\u00e9, something Laura\nmanages every time.\nMany comparisons have been drawn between\nLaura and 60s/70s folk-jazz singer-songwriter\nJoni Mitchell, comparisons which I originally\nthought were either unnecessary attempts at categorising her into the folk-hippy compartment\nof the music world, or else just plain wrong. In\nhindsight I can see that these comparisons were\nquite correct. Both artists, on a simple-minded\nlevel, play guitar and sing songs about love and\nfeminity, but much more significantly, Laura\nand Joni, until about 1971, have very similar\nhigh-register vocal styles \u2013 listen to Laura\u2019s\n\u2018Flicker and Fail\u2019 and you\u2019d think it was Joni\nsinging). Thematically, both artists seem to be\nfollowing similar routes, Joni started off singing light-hearted lovesongs, then more serious\nlovesongs, songs about children, marriage, the\nend of love, and, finally, travel and restlessness;\nLaura has followed an identical thematic path,\nthough she has not yet reached the last stage,\nnaturally, being only 21. Joni Mitchell was for\nmany years my favourite artist, so it pains me\nto say that Laura Marling may be coming close\nto bettering her. Obviously in situations like\nthis one must take into account that fact that\nJoni almost single-handedly invented the female singer-songwriter genre whereas Laura is,\nin the nicest possible sense, recycling what has\nalready been done, but to say that this makes\nJoni necessarily better than Laura is to misunderstand what folk music is about. Clearly folk\nmusic does not extend the boundaries of musical possibility as some electronic genres do,\nnor does it constantly yearn for newness and\nfreshness as pop music should. Rather, folk is a\ngenre that celebrates the past, that reworks over\nand over what has already been done in order to\nreach a perfect musical description of the high\nand low points of everyday life. It is exactly\nthis that Laura is doing so well.\nI have only seen Laura Marling live once, at\nthe Norwich Waterfront in November last year,\nand it was undoubtedly the best gig I have ever\nbeen to, partly due to the setting. If you have\nnever been to Norwich, don\u2019t expect anything,\nit is a completely average English town. The\nday I went to see Laura there was the day in November when it started to snow, and the weather\ntransformed Norwich into a beautiful, old, Tudor town. The relevance to Laura\u2019s music was\nmagnificent, for her music transforms the mediocrity of daily life into something of age-old\nbeauty. Laura played 13 songs (no encore, she\nconsiders them arrogant), three from her debut,\nseven from her second album, I Speak Because\nI Can, and three new songs. Naturally, her ten\nalready-released songs were wonderful to hear,\nher voice, smokier now than in 2008, changing early songs \u2013 which appear gentle on Alas I\nCannot Swim \u2013 into more gritty, 3-dimensional\npieces. Halfway through the set, she was on\nthe verge of treating us to a rendition of Neil\nYoung\u2019s \u2018The Needle and the Damage Done\u2019\nbut, much to my annoyance, an audience member insisted on another, less good song. Usually\nat gigs, much irritation is caused when an artist insists on playing new rather than old songs,\nbut it is a testament to Laura\u2019s writing ability\nthat the new songs were by far the highlights of\nthe set. Two of the new songs, \u2018Rest in the Bed\u2019\nand \u2018Night After Night\u2019, have names, the third\nwas a nameless medley. I very highly recommend looking up those two songs on Youtube,\nfor they are sublime, send-a-shiver-down-your-back, images-of-dark-forests, musically excel-lent, lyrically fantastic songs.\nI can\u2019t express how beautiful those new songs\nsounded that night, in a beautiful snowy town,\nstanding a metre away from one of my favourite artists, hearing music that was entirely new\nto me and yet sounded as if I had known it all\nmy life. It was music that evoked the most melancholy memories of my childhood, walking at\nnight in the woods, camping in a freezing cold\nglade. Listen to these songs and you will hear\ntrue campfire songs, never will you go back to\nNoah and the Whale or Mumford and Sons. In\nfact, to even mention such bands while listening\nto Laura\u2019s new music is laughable. She (alleg-edly) has a new album coming out this month,\nthough the lack of any publicity would suggest\notherwise. If you have never heard Laura Marling\u2019s music before, now is the perfect time to\nstart listening. If you are already a fan, her next\nalbum promises to be phenomenally good, keep\non the look-out for a release date.\nare more smoothed and rounded than \u2018A thing\nfor me\u2019. If this is a good indicator, their forthcoming album \u2018The English Riveria\u2019 is certainly looking out for when it comes out in\nApril. Christopher Walmsley\nbeen suitably rehashed by many bands,\nupdated into the new millennium and unleashed upon Radio 1. This, the debut effort\nby London based band Chapel Club may fit\ninto the aforementioned description; desolate (but not quite depressing) vocals, verses\nlittered with guitar sprawl, accompanied\nwith a punchy rhythm section. The formula\nis incredibly well executed and results in a\nremarkably accomplished album for a first\nrelease. However with all the echoes of similarly influenced bands such as Editors and\nWhite Lies, it is hard to find much originality here.\nChristopher Walmsley\nStephen Smith is clearly a fisher-man... and he\u2019s after the Marlin!\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "45\nfelix FRIDAY 11 february 2011\nSPORT\nIce Hockey:\nKnights unable\nto slay the\nmighty Devils\nSome recent strong performances saw\nthe Devils in good spirits ahead of the\nhome game against Kent, currently bottom of the league table. There is also the\nadded rivalry of going up against Imperial\u2019s old coach, Vince Miller, a lecturer\nat Kent who encouraged the formation\nof Kent\u2019s own team.\nDespite a great performance at the last\nfixture against Birmingham, the Devils\nwere slow to pick up the pace in the first\nperiod. Kent was able to keep possession for long periods and get a few shots\non goal, successfully turned away by\nDevils\u2019 Net Minder Collins, 38. Verbal\nencouragement from coach Dave Coolegem during the period saw play pick\nup and develop, culminating in an unassisted goal by Philippe Benani-Kamane\nplaying in the number 2 Jersey. Just as\nthe period was drawing to a close Devils\u2019 winger and alternate captain Marcus\nUlmefors, 25, was fairly penalised for\nchecking from behind, putting the Devils on the Penalty Kill and Ulmefors out\nfor 10 minutes. Starting the 2nd period 1\nman down the Devils held off well until a last second goal by Kent pulled the\nscore-lines level. Back in 5-on-5 play it\nwas moments before defence-man Kurt\nKolb, 12, slotted the puck, assisted by\nCaptain Ed Grant, 14. Play continued\nhot and heavy with some great body\nchecks being thrown, notably by Kolb.\nMid-way into the period Kent equalised\nagain, giving the Devils no time to rest.\nThe remainder of the period played out\nwith several scoring chances for the\nDevils, sadly none of them finding the\npuck in the back of the net.\nInspiring words from Coach Coolegem put the bit firmly between the Devils\u2019 teeth. The third period started with\na couple of strong attempts to score before Benani-Kamane, 2, got his second\ngoal assisted by Grant, 14. Back in the\nlead the Devils\u2019 had one purpose and\nthey followed up with a fourth goal minutes later by Ulmefors, 25, assisted by\nLohner, 67, and Belair, 81. Kent immediately called a time-out and it was clear\nthey would go all out to score. Coach\nCoolegem put the emphasis on safety-play, minimising the risk of conceding.\nBack on the ice and moments after the\nface-off Benani-Kamane, 2, seized the\nopportunity and scored himself a hat-trick, assisted by Kratky, 68, and Grant,\n14. Kent were enraged and drove for\ngoal on the very next face-off, scoring\ntheir third with little time remaining in\nthe period. The Devils\u2019 had a couple\nof extra chances, but played out the remaining minute with no goals leaving\nthe score-line at a comfortable 5-3 win.\nMan-of-the-Match went to Knights\u2019\n33, credited with two assists and generally agreed to be fastest on the puck,\nwhilst Devils\u2019 Dan Belair, 81, was also\nnamed despite not having scored.\nWill Mason\nIce Hockey\nIC 1st 5 - 3 Kent 1st\nNetball: Three games in three\ndays for the ladies 1st team\nHaving 3 matches in 3 days is never fun\nbut ICUNC 1s stepped up to the chal-lenge.\nOn Monday, faced with playing UCL\n1s, who looked stylish as always, the\nIC girls began their campaign to win\nthree matches in three days. With some\ngood movement around the court, it\nwasn\u2019t long before IC realised that UCL\nwere out to win and would play dirty to\nmake sure they did! Every centre our\nGD, Bernice Cutler, was elbowed in\nthe ribs as her player ran to receive the\nball as well as GA, Nicole Evans, being\npushed around at the other end. When\na complaint was put in to the umpire,\nshe simply asked if Bernice was going\nto move away and if not, then to get the\nGA back.\nAt half time UCL were at least 17\ngoals in front. But some good team\nspirit enabled us to gain back nine of\nthose goals as GS, Tamar, was on top\nform! Although we lost (simply due to\nthem playing dirty) we had to keep our\nheads held high as Tuesday\u2019s match was\nagainst the UCL Medics- RUMS.\nWherever the medics are from, IC\nalways want to beat them and RUMS\n(UCL Medics) were no exception.\nMeeting at South Ken as always, Captain Nicole remembered that Emma\nGould was unable to play sending panic\nthrough the team. How were we supposed to win with six players? Particularly as Emma was the player of the\nmatch on Monday.\nArriving in Brixton to take on RUMS\nfor the second time this term, we were\ndetermined to win even with six players.\nThey are medics after all!! It soon became clear that we were able to wipe the\nfloor with RUMS winning comfortably\nto go through to the next round of the\nULU cup...\nWhat we didn\u2019t know was that our\ncompetition for the next round was UCL\n1s who we had played the day before!\nNext time we will show them how it is\ndone.\nOur final match of the three was\nagainst LSE 1s in the far, far away\nplace that is Berrylands. After an hour\njourney there, the team were not as enthusiastic as they were at the beginning\nof the week but the fighting spirit soon\nkicked in. With fantastic movement and\ninterceptions from many players on the\ncourt including Rachel Zaborski and\nCarolyn Sharpe, IC entered the final\nquarter ahead, but not as comfortably\nas they would have hoped. Not to worry\nthough as LSE only managed to break\ndown the defence once in the whole\nquarter because they pushed over WD,\nSorcha Cotter. It was quite clever of\nthem to distract IC 1s from defending\nby pushing over the token fresher! But\ntheir dirty play was not enough to beat\nthe 1s!\nWe\u2019re up against the Medics 1s next\nweek, so let\u2019s hope it\u2019s another Medics\nteam which IC 1s are able to beat!!\nNetball\nIC 1st 38-46 UCL\nIC 1st 31-16 RUMS\nIC 1st 32-22 LSE\nBernice Cutler\never, as the second half saw the midfield\ntrio of Zarnas, Wilson and Benincasa\ndictating play with neat interchanges.\nImperial\u2019s lead was extended to three\ngoals when Eshun was clattered by an\noutpaced RUMS full-back, just yards\nfrom the box. Benincasa lofted the resulting free-kick into the danger zone,\nand Zarnas duly leapt to steer the ball\ninto top-right corner of the net with a\nwell-placed header.\nHaving effectively sealed the game\nImperial\u2019s tempo dropped temporarily,\npermitting RUMS a few tentative forays towards the Imperial goal \u2013 pressure\nwhich was readily absorbed, and failed\nFootball: 1st\nteam go top of\ntable and into\nULU Semi\u2019s\nto draw a save from Garner in goal.\nThe final minutes of the match saw renewed efforts from Imperial, with Robinson and Roshid both going close. The\nlast word in the match was grabbed by\nBeswetherick who, having been hacked\ndown inside the area, rammed the resulting penalty into the roof of the net in\nemphatic fashion \u2013despite protestations\nfrom Imperial defender Graham.\nHonours for Man of the Match were\nsplit between Zarnas and Benincasa,\nthough there were many potential can-didates. 4-0 was the final score, with the\n1s easing into the Cup semi-finals, and\nin good spirits ahead of the upcoming\nmatch against league contenders LSE.\n...Continued from Back Page\nMixed bag of results in London fixtures\n\n"

The Daily\nis one of a handful of publications that exists\nsolely as an app, a big gamble from a corporation that has until now been relatively wary of\nonline media.\nThe subscription model on which the magazine is based on is very similar to print mod-els: users can choose to pay $40/year or $0.99/\nday for continued updates to material, with a\npromise of up to 100 pages of fresh content\nevery day.\nThe advantage of the iPad-only nature of\nthe magazine lies in the fact that it has been\ndesigned to seamlessly interact with HD quality videos, photo galleries and popular social\nnetworks. Unike many other news publications\nwith supporting iPad apps, the content doesn\u2019t\nmirror material on a more traditional website,\nbut caters specifically to iPad users.\nThe move is likely to be watched closely by\nother media houses as print revenues dry up.\nMurdoch has played up the financial viability\nof the move, stating that the monthly investment on the app is a relatively low $2 million/\nmonth.

The iPod touch actually has pretty decent\nbattery life, but there are lots of occasions when\nyou just can\u2019t get to a power outlet to get your\npocket pal all charged up, and that\u2019s where Mophie\u2019s Juice Pack Air comes in.\nThe Air performs two functions: firstly, it\u2019s a\nfully-fledged case for your iPod touch, covering everything but the screen and chrome be-zel. It\u2019s main feature however, is its integrated\n1000mAh lithium polymer battery capable to\nadding up to an additional seven hours video\nplayback or 42 hours music playback.

Played by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, she\nmay be a damsel but she certainly not distressed.\nMattie Ross is the epitome of the strong female\nlead and in some ways, Republican values of\nself-reliance and independence from the estab-lishment. As she goes through her adventure, we\nTrue Grit was truly a surprise at the Golden\nGlobes. Not for any record breaking achievement but rather for its surprising lack of rec-ognition. The film was hailed as one of the\nracehorses set for a slew of gongs during the\nawards season, but gasp! The Coen brother\u2019s\nlatest western was not even graced with a single nomination at the Globes.\nA remake of the Oscar-winning 1969 film\nbased on a novel by Charles Portis, True Grit\nis the story a 14-year old Mattie Ross seeking\nto bring justice upon the coward Tom Chaney\nwho murdered her father. True Grit is the Lord\nof the Rings in a western genre, as Mattie\u2019s quest\nbrings her on an epic journey in the great wilderness of the Indian Territory in 19th century US.\nHerAragorn and Boromir are renegade US Marshall Rooster Cogburn played by Jeff Bridges,\nand straight-laced Texan ranger LaBoeuf played\nby Matt Damon. It a tale of growing up and innocence lost (the way Frodo lost his to Sam\u2026).\nFor all the gunshots seen and heard in the\ntrailer, True Grit is more drama than action. It\nis a masterful contemplation on the nature of\nvengeance and female strength in a Wild West\nbackdrop with a bunch of unruly gunslingers. It\nchallenges the motive of those seeking to bring\njustice in their own hands, when the line between revenge and justice becomes blurred. A\nfirst time foray into the western genre, the Coen\nbrothers\u2019 gun standoffs are superb and stylish.\nThere\u2019s even a Tarantino-style scene!\nThe plot of the movie unfolds in its own sweet\ntime as if reading a Frank Herbert novel. Scenes\nlike the 10-minute introduction to Rooster Cogburn may well falter and become a drag, but not\nunder the direction and script of the Coen broth-ers. The script is peppered with sardonic wit and\ndark, deadpan humour and, together with the\nheavy southern twang, they make the film such\nfun to watch. Though the film\u2019s motley crew and\ntheir humorous antics in trying to get along are\npriceless, what makes the film a must-watch is\nJeff Bridge\u2019s character. The shoot-first-talk-later\nCogburn, is the antithesis of the cavalier cowboy\nfrom classic western flicks. Though a lawman,\nhis actions are sometimes questionable and as\nJeff Bridges describes it, he has a foot on both\nsides of the law. Mattie Ross hired him to hunt\ndown Tom Chaney due to his reputation as a\nman with \u2018true grit\u2019. Rooster Cogburn is such\na likable character, not just for his don\u2019t-givea-damn charisma but because beneath the gritty\nexterior, there lies a knight who rides in and save\nthe day when Mattie is in need.\nsee her transform, lose her innocence, and ultimately learn the price of retribution.\nJosh Brolin plays the villain, Tom Chaney. His\ncharacter was built up from what the protagonist\ntalked about him, until we are finally introduced\nto him in a climactic meeting. It\u2019s particularly\nenjoyable to see Brolin\u2019s wonderful character\nin action, and I wished that he got more screen\nClassic Cinema\nKramer vs. Kramer\nWith Valentine\u2019s Day approaching, I realise that it\u2019s\npretty pessimistic to be reviewing Kramer vs. Kramer\n\u2013 a milestone of a film that discussed the then-rare\ntopic of divorce in frank, almost brutal honesty. Nevertheless, Kramer vs. Kramer was a hit at the Oscars\nin the late 70s and continues to be an enduring embodiment of modern families. Starring the ineffable\nduo of Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman as a couple\nparting ways, leaving their young son caught in be-tween, Kramer vs. Kramer could be considered to be\npioneering in the way it portrayed its characters.\nReleased in 1979, the film reflects feminist movements at the time by having the housewife, Joanna\nKramer (Streep) as the one to cut and run. In her\nwake, father, Ted Kramer (Hoffman) and their six-year\nold son are shaken to the core, their comfortable,\nroutine lives irreversibly altered. We watch Ted \u2013 previously the stereotypical workaholic father \u2013 and his\nson both struggle to understand what has happened,\nand try to form some kind of life without Joanna.\nStreep, though not on screen nearly as much as\nHoffman, is strongly felt in her absence and her appearances as the isolated wife in turmoil, fighting\nfor custody of her abandoned son, are measured\nand impeccably delivered. Hoffman meanwhile carries the film well with young actor Justin Henry (who\nnever beat this performance and instead faded into\nsemi-obscurity), trying to gather their world together\nin a moving, daring and truly excellent film.\nIt is not as thoroughly miserable as this synopsis\nsounds, though \u2013there are funny moments, such as\nthe classic father-son bonding-over-peeing scene\nthat seems to have got rehashed somehow in Adam\nSandler\u2019s Big Daddy. But for a film about divorce \u2013 a\ntopic that so often gets chewed over in Hollywood\nfilms for easy dramatic effect \u2013 Kramer vs. Kramer is\none of the most delicate and touching portrayals of\nthis intimate family tragedy.\nJade Hoffman\nDustin Hoffman: child-snatcher\nThe Coen brothers\u2019 gun\nstandoffs are superb and\nstylish.\n\u201c\nlishment. As she g\nlishment. As she g\nut not\nroth-h-t and\nand\nh the\nh the\nsuch\nsuch\nw and\nw and\ng are\nare\nThe Coen\nThe Coen\nstandoffs\nstandoffs\n\u201d\nsuperb and\nsuperb and\ntime. Nevertheless, the Coen brothers have a\nknack for staying faithful to the book, just as\nthey did with No Country for Old Men.\nSet in the epic wilderness of the Indian Territory, this must be one of the most scenic westerns.\nThe soundtrack by the Coen brother\u2019s long time\ncollaborator, Carter Burwell brings to life the\nspirit of adventure in the sweeping wilderness,\nin the manner of the late John Barry\u2019s theme\nfor the score of Dances with Wolves. Burwell\u2019s\ntheme for Mattie Ross evokes her taste for adventure and ever-present optimism amidst the\nharsh challenges she faces. All in all, it\u2019s a well-composed modern cowboy score.\nAs if retribution for going unrecognized in\nthe Golden Globes, True Grit wrath is felt in\nthe BAFTAs and Oscars with 8 BAFTA nominations and a stonking 10 for the Academy\nAwards. Perhaps the 6000 plus filmmakers and\nactors at the Academy who are responsible for\nvoting found True Grit to be more to their taste\nthan the 60-odd film critics at the Hollywood\nForeign PressAssociation who decides who gets\nwhat in the Golden Globes.\nWhether you are up for some cowboy action\nor some drama, True Grit is well worth watch-ing.All in all, True Grit shows us that a woman\u2019s\nwrath is truly a force to be reckoned with.\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "37\nThe latest antics from Priya Garg, who tosses away her inhibitions and embraces the manic culture of Argentina\u2019s booming capital\nAmbling Argentinean escapades\nS\nurviving a semi-camo twenty four hour bus journey,\nwe arrived at the slightly\ngrubby omnibus terminal\nin the iconic metropolis of\nBuenos Aires. Throwing ourselves onto\nthe Subte (Argentina\u2019s answer to the\ntube) we were presented with an antique\nwooden carriage complete with grey\nleather sashes hanging from the ceiling\nand extravagant glass wall lights.\nThe London Underground it was not.\nWinding through the quaint streets of\nSan Telmo to our hostel, we found it\namidst broken paving stones, crumbling\ncolonial buildings, pillared walls, beautiful balconies and intricately carved\ngates. This was the hippie art district of\nBuenos Aires, a small residential area\nboasting artists, musicians and design-ers, housed within a bustling city full of\nlight and life.\nThat night we attempted to cross the\nAvenue 9 de Julio, one of the widest\nroads in the world, each flank comprising of more than seven lanes in each\ndirection, with careering Argentinean\ntaxis speeding wildly round each corner\nspilling profanities. Bemusedly, the cen-tre-piece of this magnificently broad avenue was formed by a soaring phallus-like obelisk which rose up to touch the\nsky, translating little of Buenos Aire\u00b4s\nArgentinean charm.\nAs we walked toward the centre of\nthe city, we quickly discovered again\nthe disappointing taint of globalisation,\nfrom American-influenced street names\nto fast-food restaurants, and the unfortunately termed \u00b4Palermo Hollywood\u00b4\ndistrict that boasts showy nightclubs and\npizza restaurants. Several blocks down,\nthe Avenue de Florida was alive with\ntango dancers and merchants flogging\nthe deprecatingly termed \u2018gringo gear\u2019\n\u2013 everything from leggings, teapots\nand glowing snow-globes to maracas,\nfriendship bracelets and postcards.\nBeyond this hectic gathering lay the\ngrandiose Casa Rosada, a huge pink\npalace, home of the executive seats of\nthe ruling government of Argentina\nand offices of the President. Gilt, gold,\nfountains, finery and ostentatious guards\nnow cover this historic monument. Perhaps the most infamous President, Juan\nDomingo Peron, husband of the much\nglorified \u00b4Evita\u00b4 Eva Peron still imposes\nhis presence upon both the building and\nthe rest of the city.\nPeronism remains a contentious issue in Buenos Aires, with \u00b4Up Evita\u00b4\nscrawled across walls next to our hotel\nand bygone Peronist politics under constant hushed discussion. If you wander\naround the non-government funded\n\u00b4Evita Museum\u00b4 you will find an encapsulated shrine to the actress-comewomen\u00b4s rights activist, telling of her\nsocial reforms and charitable welfare\npolicies but little to enlighten you as to\nwhy her body was desecrated before it\ncame to lie in the Recoleta cemetery,\nonly adding to the mystery over Argentina\u2019s chequered and complex political\nhistory. Asking locals to unravel our\nconfusion, we were often told \u201cwe don\u2019t\nwant to speak about it\u201d.\nSeveral streets down, next to the\nInstitute of Tango, we visited the oldest cafe in Argentina, the Tortoni. A\npopular building where elderly waiters\nin striped trousers, bowties and carrying white cloths over one arm, click\nthrough mahogany walled surroundings\nand stained glass ceilings, memorising\norders and bringing you fried sweet\n\u2018churros\u2019 pastries or sticky \u2018dulce de\nleche\u2019 caramel covered biscuits. As if\nstatic from the 1920s, it gives an otherworldly air to the painted, modern surrounding streets.\nFinding much more live music here\nthan in our search for samba in Rio de\nJaneiro, we were delighted to see guitar\nbands and drummers on every corner.\nDisappointed by some of the passionless glum tango couples flicking heels\nfor tourist pesos, we were mesmerised\nby one Spanish guitarist, whose fingers\nran down his fret board strumming and\nplucking, until two street children ran\nup and smacked his guitar mid-perfor-swayed and jumped to loud Argentinean\nbeats, recorders and saxophonists. The\nclub was aswirl with cigarette smoke,\nsweat, Brahma beer underfoot and the\npassion of a pounding band behind.\nWalking out of the heat of the venue\ncouples dotted the streets, wrapped in\npublic displays of affection, on benches,\nin parks and against walls. Our English\nreserve and respect for personal proximity seemed almost prudent as we,\narms extended, shook hands with our\nArgentinean neighbours, very \u00b4proper\u00b4\nand \u00b4how do you do\u00b4, while any local\nwould grasp us by the arm and kiss on\nthe cheek in a first introduction. Our\nnational stereotypes were magnified in\ntheir dichotomy in manner.\nOn our penultimate evening, we were\ntreated to a typical national meal with\ntwo locals, who were kind enough to\ntake us to a hearty restaurant, buzzing\nat one o\u2019clock in the morning, full of\npeople slicing grilled meats and savour-ing deep-flavoured red wine.

With heroes being sent in every three minutes\nor so, random tasks being set involving\nridiculous requirements (usually involving sending all your money), failure\npenalties that hold you back \u2013 all this\nslows down the game even further.\nHowever, when the game comes down\nto just designing dungeons (in sandbox\nmode) where you are rid of the stupid\ntasks, it is a lot more enjoyable. Having\nfree reign over traps, monsters and artefacts really lets the game flow better\nand allows you to really do well at taking down heroes. In this version of the\ngame it is easy to get distracted for ages.\nUnfortunately, this really doesn\u2019t make\nup for just how awful the campaign is.\nIn all, the game presents a good idea,\nand it could have worked really well.\nIt\u2019s just a shame that the campaign expects so much of players right from the\nbeginning and causes pure frustration.\nHad the campaign been more similar to\nthat of the free style mode then I could\neasily have seen it being a much more\nenjoyable game. But as it is, while the\nsandbox mode is a lot of fun in it\u2019s own\nright, the campaign just felt like more\neffort than enjoyment \u2013 really not what I\nwant in a game.\nDungeons is available now from\nRealmforge and Kalypso Media for\nPC, retailing at \u00a329.99.\nD\nungeons, the sequel to\nthe 90\u2019s classic Dungeon\nKeeper, is a sim-man-agement game that sets\nthe player as a Dungeon\nLord who must design their foul, evil\ncave of despair to entince in heroes...\nbefore brutally murdering them at their\npeak to steal their \u2018soul energy\u2019. The\nidea is basic enough; your dungeon is\nmade more tempting by artefacts, monsters and traps. In order to buy more of\nthese you must harvest more and more\nsoul energy from captured heroes.\nDifferent heroes are interested in different things. Some enjoy looting and\nstealing treasure, whereas others get a\nkick out of avoiding traps or fighting\nmonsters. Therefore, it is important to\nhave a good mixture of both gold piles\nand monsters in order to keep all the\nheroes interested. Heroes enter your\ndungeon through special gates and are\nled through your dungeon by artefacts\nthat you own which attract their atten-tion. As they wander through, they find\nyour piles of gold or monsters and begin\nfighting or looting at their will. You then\nmust watch carefully as their interest bar\nfills up so that you can kill them and take\ntheir soul energy when it\u2019s full.\nThe types of monster you have depend\non the monsters you can find in the area\naround your dungeon. You can search\nfor new types of monster and by placing a pentagram near their habitat you\ncan start to spawn that type into your\ndungeon. However, there\u2019s a limit on the\nnumber of pentagrams you can place,\nand it\u2019s infuriatingly low meaning that\nyou can only have a very small number\nof monsters present in your dungeon.\nThis very quickly becomes an issue as\nheroes enter every two or three minutes\nand each of them is strong enough to kill\nall your monsters. As you can imagine\nthis makes it very difficult to maintain\nthe interest of heroes that like fighting\nmonsters, and the game slows down a\nlot as it becomes so challenging to build\nup soul energy.\nOften it can take hours to get through\ncertain levels and considering that you\naren\u2019t directly doing anything this makes\nthe game unbelievably dull at times. Not\nonly that, but pentagrams must be built\non the edges of your territory in order to\nexpand, so monsters end up out of the\nway rather than being somewhere useful\nin your dungeon.\nMonsters are not controllable, which\nmeans they stick to their pentagram\nand do not make any impression on the\nheroes unless the heroes start fighting\nBeing a Dungeon Lord\nain\u2019t all fun and games\nFriday 11 february 2011\nthem. It\u2019s too easy for heroes to breeze\nthrough your dungeon with little risk\nat all. The entire burden of looking after the dungeon comes down to your\nDungeon Lord \u2013 the only controllable\ncharacter in the game. This would be\nall well and good were it not for the fact\nthat often even the most basic hero can\ntake out your lord with relative ease. So,\nas the heroes level up it becomes almost\nimpossible to gather soul energy and\nprogress in the game.\nThere are also a very limited amount\nof choices in Dungeons. The monsters\nLast weekend I bagged tickets to an exclusive Nintendo 3DS hands-on preview\n\u2013 and first impressions were excellent!\nAfter a vague demonstration of StreetPass, \u201creal-life\u201d demonstrations of Street\nFighter and Resident Evil, and a brief introductory video featuring Jonathan Ross\n(seemingly the new face of Nintendo Europe), I got my hands on the 3DS.\nFirst off, the main selling point, the\nscreen: it works brilliantly! As soon as\nI picked up the 3DS I was seeing the\nfull effect of the 3D \u2013 it worked straight\nfrom the off. The effect was fantastic,\nespecially considering the fact that it\nwas glasses-free and instant. While not\nall the games I played made great use of\nthe 3D, those that did (Kid Icarus: Uprising springs to mind) looked excellent,\nwith enemies zooming in from the distance and text coming out of the screen\nat you. However, the 3D effect only\nworks in certain \u2018sweet spots\u2019. You can\ntilt the screen as much as you like towards and away from you with no con-sequence, but twisting the device from\nside to side removes the 3D effect until\nyou hit another sweet spot.\nThe rest of the hardware also worked\nwell \u2013 the analog pad felt good under the\nthumb, gliding easily with the games responding accordingly. The dual camera\nsystem on the outside of the system produced great 3D photos, however when\nusing the screen as a viewfinder the image looked a little blurry and some of the\nobjects\u2019 depths looked a little off. Luckily, the software then seemed to perform\nsome sort of rendering process that resulted in a realistic 3D image.\nThe \u201cNext Generation Portable\u201d a.k.a.\nthe PSP2, was announced two weeks ago\nat Sony\u2019s \u2018Playstation Meeting 2011\u2019.\nThe world stared, the world gaped and\nthe world was awed. Quite right too:\nfew had been expecting such an impressive device. (Thankfully it won\u2019t be long\nbefore the device itself slams onto our\nsupermarket shelves).\nBut while the world stared doe-eyed,\ncooing over the newborn baby, another\nequally important announcement passed\nright over everyone\u2019s heads. It wasn\u2019t\njust a new console; it was 32 million\nnew consoles. Sony announced the PlayStation Suite, a hardware-independent\nplatform that will bring a whole new\nway of gaming to a range of devices,\nstarting with any mobile phone running\non Android 2.3. You read that right, any\nAndroid phone.\nThis is great news for any owners\nof those aforementioned smartphones.\nSony have already guaranteed that\nthey\u2019ll be bringing PlayStation One\ngames to the Suite within the calendar year, so owners can look forward\nto some sweet 3D PS One titles \u2013 um,\nCrash Bandicoot anyone? Third-party\ntitles have also been assured, although\nno names have been dropped, yet.\nDevelopers are likely, however, to\nsign up in droves to this new initia-tive, as it\u2019s great news for anyone in the\nbusiness of building games. The whole\nconcept behind the Suite is that it\u2019s hard-ware-independent, meaning that a game\nbuilt to run on one smartphone will also\nrun on any other. Compatibility is a big\ngripe for developers and users alike,\nand hopefully the Playstation Suite will\nallow more time to be spent on actually building games, rather than porting\nthem from one platform to another.\nThe Suite is not limited to Android\nphones either. There have been rumours\nthat Sony is planning to bring the framework to a lot of new, unconventional\nplatforms. The PlayStation 3 seems an\nobvious choice, and bringing the Suite\nto the iPhone and even to Windows has\nalso been rumoured. Given their place in\nthe TV market, some sources have suggested that Sony also want to open it up\nInternet-enabled Bravia TVs, too.\nWhatever the specifics, the PlayStation Suite is certainly a huge leap in a\nnew direction for Sony. Some commentators have been sceptical over whether\nor not such a system really can be made\ncompatible over such a large range of\nhardware. Certainly, bringing games to\nany Android phone is a massive technical challenge, and Sony has quite a suite\nof problems to solve. But with the potential to bring big name titles onto so\nmany new devices, let\u2019s all keep our fingers crossed that they manage it!\nPlayStation Suite\nto bring big titles\nto Android phones\nNintendo 3DS: an\nexclusive hands-on preview\nSimon Worthington Chris Bowers\n\u201cThe 3D worked\nstraight from the off\u201d\n\u201cWhen the game\ncomes down to just\ndesigning dungeons\nit\u2019s a lot more\nenjoyable\u201d\nI managed to play a good selection\nof games across the two sessions, from\na range of developers. Ocarina of Time\nand Kid Icarus both looked great and\nplayed really well. Also on display was\nthe fantastic Augmented Reality card\nsystem which was great fun, spawning\ngiant crystal snakes out of the surface\nyou place the card on, and Face Raiders, a quirky but fun game that made\ngood use of the 3D cameras and facial\nrecognition technology. From third party\ndevelopers, Raving Rabbids: Travel in\nTime was just a pretty standard platform-er, while Super Monkey Ball made good\nuse of the available motion sensors with\nsome minor control issues.\nOverall, the 3DS is looking like it\u2019ll\nbe a great console, and a huge hit too.\nForget the (arrogantly named) \u201cNext\nGeneration Portable\u201d, this is the handheld to have.\nSean Harbison unleashes his wrath in Dungeons\nare limited to what you find in the level,\nand the number of pentagrams you can\nset.

    "content": "FILM\nWhat does it means to\nbe a human being?\nWelcome to Hailsham, an idyllic English boarding school in the peaceful\ncountryside. Students of Hailsham are\nspecial and the headmistress Miss Emily\n(Charlotte Rampling) emphasises that\nthe students\u2019 well-being is of paramount\nimportance. Nothing seems to be out of\nthe ordinary for this seemingly prestigious school but these young and na\u00efve\nstudents have no idea what awful future\nawaits them. Indeed, the students of\nHailsham are special. They have been\ncreated artificially to be used as donors\nof vital organs for people in the outside\nworld. Essentially, the school is a forever functioning genetic factory.\nBased on the best-selling book by Kazuo Ishiguro, the adaptation of Never\nLet Me Go follows Kathy, Ruth and\nTommy (Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield); three young\n\u201cstudents\u201d of Hailsham who are caught\nup in this disturbing drama. Even from\na young age, they are bound by a love\ntriangle that develops into an awkward\nrelationship as they grow up. As a rumour spreads that a couple truly in love\nwill be given a \u201cdeferral,\u201d a few years\u2019\nextension on their short lives, this is\nbrought to a crunch. Hope runs high,\nbut not everything can resolve itself in\na neat and painless way. Mulligan and\nGarfield both have chances to show off\nin the story\u2019s climax, and they embrace\ntheir dramatic moments, with Garfield\u2019s\nintense performance marking the film\u2019s\nmost highlighted scene with utmost\nconfidence.\nMulligan also plays a central role\nwhich, though not an obviously showy\npart, is deeply moving in its subdued\nand warm delivery. Anyone who\u2019s seen\nMulligan in An Education knows just\nhow much potential and talent the young\nEnglish actress possesses. With Never\nLet Me Go we are firmly reminded that\nall praise was justified and she holds a\ngreat deal of promise. But the true revelation of the film is the new rising star\nGarfield. Looking worryingly thin and\npale, his shy, soft-spoken character is in\nstark contrast to his confident, slick performance in The Social Network. As he\nstruggles to fully voice what\u2019s going on\nin his head, the often clueless nature of\nhis character is captured with fine precision by the young actor.\nAnother feature of the film which\nplays well is the lack of mystery around\nthe fact that these clones were created for\nthe purpose of becoming donor. There is\nabsolutely no action/thriller component\nin the film and director Mark Romanek\nwisely chooses to steer away from a\noverly twist-filled and puzzling tone.\nThere are many hints throughout and the\nrevelation comes at a very early stage,\nFELIX 29\nin a depressing monologue delivered as\nwarmly as possible by Miss Lucy (Sally\nHawkins). Instead, Romanek is interested in the consequences our characters\nface and the lack of free will all human\nbeings should be entitled to. Donating\nyour organs is a selfless act, but being\nforced into this \u2013 manufactured for it \u2013\nwhen you\u2019re barely thirty is horrifying.\nA couple of undeveloped ideas do\nmake us question the validity of the\nfilm\u2019s ending. Some of its elements\nseem too forced for the sake of the melancholy mood. Because it spends too\nmuch time zooming in on the characters\u2019\nexpressions and love triangle, it hardly\ntackles the important issues which are\ninstead rather hastily wrapped up in a\nclumsy voiceover. Although leaving the\nviewers to do much thinking is not bad\nin its entirety, the film\u2019s focus appears to\nshift somewhere along the way.\nWhat it means to be a human being,\nhow our souls and bodies function are\nimportant issues to address in this time\nof much technological advancement.\nTo an extent Never Let Me Go gets you\nstarted in that thought process. Whether\nyou are moved enough to think deeper\nabout the subject matters is entirely up\nto you, but for me, this was an unquestionably depressing and touching film.\nPassionate and cool:\nnot just another film\nabout boxing...\nHilarity ensues at the thought of Keira Knightley eating a full meal\nDirector Mark Romanek\nScreenwriter Alex Garland, Kazuo\nIshiguro (novel)\nCast Carey Mulligan, Keira\nKnightley, Andrew Garfield\nNever Let Me Go\nJohn Park\nDo we really need another boxing film?\nCan anyone make a film that will better\nthe much loved Rocky? Or a film that is\nas aesthetically pleasing as Raging Bull,\nwhich has the reputation of being so\nbeautiful that each frame could be hung\non a wall as a piece of art? Will we ever\nsee a true story documentary as thrilling\nand as exciting as Rumble In The Jungle? The trailer for The Fighter leaves\nus guessing.\nThe Fighter tells the story of Micky\nWard Micky (Mark Wahlberg) who\nreaches the heights of the world of boxing in 2000 by becoming light welterweight world champion. Though he\nachieves this with the help of his friends\nand family, the film really centres on the\nconflict within this group, with the star\nof the show instead being Micky\u2019s broth-er, Dickey (Christian Bale): a washed-up, drug-addicted, ex-boxer who trains\nMicky. The other key characters that\nplay their roles in this conflict, include\nhis mouths-to-feed manager/mother, Ibelieve-in-my-son father, hot-red-head\nlove interest and take-no-shit trainer.\nThe passion between the brothers is\ncaptured beautifully, and it\u2019s not really\nabout Micky winning the world title but\nabout Dickey getting over his crack ad-diction. Christian Bale has always been\none to drastically alter his body for a\nrole (life-threateningly thin for The Machinist, bulky-hunk for Batman Begins)\nbut you would swear that he\u2019s a been\ncrack-smoking, street-cleaner for the\nmajority of his life with this character.\nPersonally I don\u2019t think Bale should be\nup for the Best Supporting Oscar but\nshould be up for Best Leading Actor; he\nfar outshines Wahlberg as an eccentric\nand as a socialite.\nWhat David O. Russell has achieved\nis a different kind of boxing story: an\nexciting, enticing and elevating story.\nThink of the coolness that Three Kings\nachieved with its expert use of music\nand apply this to an exciting boxing sto-ry. It\u2019s got success written all over it and\nthe downfalls are few and far between.\nThough we don\u2019t see much of the fieriness of the love interest, and perhaps\nmore of Dickey\u2019s time in jail would have\nbeen interesting for the viewer, these are\nall just small blemishes on what is the\ncomplete finish of an excellent film.\nDirector David O. Russell\nScreenwriter Scott Silver, Paul\nTamasy, Eric Johnson\nCast Mark Wahlberg, Christian\nBale, Amy Adams\nThe Fighter\nJake Lea-Wilson\nNobody has ever looked as\nuncomfortable as Wahlberg here\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "32\nTELEVISION\nfelix\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nVeronika McQuadeova\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSex, Drugs & Growing Old\nCorrie Berry\nSkins, Season 5, has just started, and the\nfirst comment on Twitter was \u201cWhere is\nall the sex, drugs and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll?\u201d\nFollowing a cast of teenagers through\nSixth Form, the show provides a commentary on life in Bristol for 16 to 18\nyear olds attending Roundview College.\nSeasons 1 and 2 were totally unique, addressing (among other issues) teenage\npregnancy, loss of a parent and death of a\nfriend. School was treated as a platform\nfor social dramas; the only academic issue being coursework deadlines \u2013 met\nafter an all-nighter at a groaning com-puter. Along the way, we were treated\nto gratuitous amounts of sex, drug and\nalcohol. Seasons 3 and 4 addressed the\nsame themes in a slightly different way,\nwith a revitalised cast that brought a few\nadded surprises. The second casting initially met resistance, but was ultimately\naccepted as the fourth season came to a\nshocking and nail-biting conclusion.\nThe show picked up a number of\nawards, including a BAFTA and a Golden Rose for outstanding drama and best\ntitles. Names such as Nicholas Hoult,\nfrom \u201cAbout A Boy\u201d and Dev Patel\nfrom \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d rubbed\nshoulders with relative unknowns, who\nwere no less brilliant despite their in-experience, particularly the one unifying character over the cast change: Effy\nStonem, played by Kaya Scodelario. Of\nparticular surprise was the way the casts\nseem to adjust to their roles with apparent ease; mature content is convincingly\nportrayed by actors as young as 14. (In-cidentally, MTV has just started airing\nthe American equivalent and are now\nfacing child pornography charges, with\ntheir youngest cast member at 15.)\nThe third generation cast has totally\nreplaced any recurring characters from\nSeason 4. Season 5 opens with Dakota\nBlue Richards, of \u201cThe Golden Compass\u201d playing Franky, the character\naround whom the first episode centres.\nInstead of rampant sex, alcoholism\nand drug abuse, this character is quiet,\nclearly disturbed, and so awkward that I\ncringed as I watched.\nInstead of aiming to shock, the writers\nappear to have changed their observation of teenage life, concentrating on\nthe progression from awkward teenager\nto adult instead of jumping straight into\nfully-fledged badly-behaved adults.\nSkins 1 to 4 were so shocking because\nthey left audiences asking the question\n\u201cDo teenagers really behave like this?\u201d\nThe probable answer was no; the format\nof the show necessarily had to change.\nThe second episode features Rich, a\n\u2018metalhead\u2019 \u2013 stubborn, obsessed with\nmetal, trying to get the girl, and so Imperial that anybody who watches it will\nWhat We Watched...\nIt\u2019s that time when all the post-Christmas series are\ncoming to an end, and writing this column is really difficult when there\u2019s sod all on telly, so a couple of the\nshows could possibly be repeats. They should be just\nas good as when they were first broadcast though so\nno complaining.\nLark Rise to Candleford is one of those programmes that is guaranteed to bring a smile to your\nface. Set in 19th-century Oxfordshire, the delightful\nseries is based upon an autobiography written by\nFlora Thomson about a young girl sent to the local\nmarket town to begin an apprenticeship with the\npostmistress. Not many costume dramas manage to\neffect a whole spectrum of emotion whilst bestowing a few good moral scruples, and that\u2019s what really makes Lark Rise stand out as the epitome of\ncheer-me-up-it\u2019s-Sunday viewing. It\u2019s just beautiful.\nThe filming of the series must have been terribly difficult due to its dependence on cloudless skies in\nall but one episode. Postman Thomas\u2019s musings on\nthe \u201cways of the almighty\u201d and half-witted housemaid\nMinnie\u2019s constant worryings and faux-pas are funnier\nthan most of the egregious bunk which falls under\nthe banner of \u2018comedy\u2019 today.\nThe rather ominously titled The Chinese are Coming\u2019 \u2013 thankfully not a government-commissioned\nporno \u2013 tells the story of the said government\u2019s immoral and rapacious ravishment of any African country happening to be in a sufficient state of poverty.\nKenneth Brannagh returned this week in the title\nrole of the BBC\u2019s adaptation of the Swedish detective series Wallander. The Swedish version is occasionally shown on BBC4 and is actually much better\n- though you really have to be \u2018in the mood for subtitles\u2019 to fully appreciate it. Some of the gore-laden\nscenes are almost as disturbing as Gary Gilitter\u2019s\nidea of a dirty weekend, but don\u2019t forget to show off\nhow intellectual you are because you watched something on BBC4.\nITV\u2019s new thriller Marchlands, having had a full\npage ad devoted to it in The Times, looked as though\nit may be better than the usual commercial-splat-tered arse-gravy that ITV generally broadcast. Starring Dean Andrews (Ray from Life on Mars/Ashes to\nAshes) it is based around the lives of three families\nin the same (rather spooky) house, spread twenty\nyears apart.\nStrange happenings build up the suspense nicely but the (presumably low) special effects budget\nmustn\u2019t have permitted anything more than a few\nmisbehaving domestic appliances, unexpected faces in mirrors and a fall from a stepladder (...scary\ntimes!).\nOther than that it\u2019s actually rather good! Commercial breaks are more irritating when experienced via\nthe ultra-low-resolution ITVPlayer because the ad\nbreak is long enough to put the kettle on but too\nshort to make a brew. They are obviously not from\nthe North.\nIf you didn\u2019t get the box-set for Christmas (or your\nmum didn\u2019t) Julian Fellowes\u2019 (recently Baron Fellowes of West Stafford) pre-WWI costume drama Downton Abbey which stars Hugh Bonneville and Maggie\nSmith (also Brendan Coyle and Ruby Bentall from\nLark Rise), is definitely a must-see! (And it\u2019s repeating on ITV at the moment).\nTuesday Wednesday Thursday If you missed it...\nFriday Saturday Sunday Monday\nOne Born Every Minute\nValentine\u2019s in front of the telly?\nWatch babies come out of vaginas.\nC4, 9pm\nBAFTAs\nOr as they\u2019ll call them from now\non, the \u201cColins\u201d.\nBBC2, 8pm\nAir Force One\nA film so bad it\u2019s not only good,\nit\u2019s incredible.\nBBC3 , 9.45pm\nReggae Britannia\nPeople who are too ashamed to go\nto the doctors do so on TV...\nBBC4, 9pm\nThe Nutty Professor\nStill down about Valentines Day?\nThis will sort you out.\nITV1 , 10.30pm\nAir Force One\nTwice?!

Again, a totally different tone to\nany of the characters we have seen pre-viously, and a complete divergence from\nany familiar storyline.\nWe have had a couple of hints at the\nrest of the cast \u2013 Grace, a ballerina, who\nseems too good to be true, but is clearly\na deeper character than she appears on\nthe surface; Mini, a Queen Bee (think\n\u201cMean Girls\u201d but a west country accent);\nMatty, an enigmatic mystery man who\nhas stared down the barrel of a gun and\nsex-obsessed Alo, the token ginger.\nSo far, I withhold judgement. I don\u2019t\nknow why I loved the first two casts so\nmuch \u2013 probably because they were so\nout-of-this-world that it was fascinating to watch, instead of what felt like\nan in-depth exploration of the teenage\npsyche. I\u2019ve found the use of awkward\nsilences and stilted conversation really uncomfortable; but the show is still\ncompelling, and perhaps the thing that is\nso strange now will revitalise it and give\nit a different kind of edge. I don\u2019t know\nwhere the writers are going to take it but\nI will be sticking around to find out.\n\u201cThink Mean Girls, but with a\nwest country accent\u201d\nI\u2019m sorry, but nobody dresses like the guy second from the right.

Several questions did not allow multiple choice\nwhere they plainly should have (\u2018Where\nhave you had sex on campus?\u2019 being an\nobvious example), and others had too limited a range of answers \u2013 many legitimate\nrespondents complained that a limit of\nfour sex toys was far\nmost egregious mist\nto group people with\nsexual partners toge\n1-5 category instead\n3, 4, 5).

While the data has\ncertain obvious flaws (see \u2018Sensitivity and Reliability\u2019\nbelow), it nonetheless leads to interesting conclu-sions.

The Maths Department simultaneously boasts the highest proportion of\nvirgins as well as of students who have sex every day\n(the department must be full of envious stares across\nthe lecture theatres).\nWe saw that male-dominated departments collectively masturbate more than their gender-equal equiv-alents; mainly because men were revealed to masturbate far more than women.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\n14\nPolitics Editors: Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nUnited States\nMore than 1,000 protestors have stormed a courthouse and burned two churches in Central Java.\nThe crowd were demanding a stiffer sentence for\na man who was sentenced to five years imprisonment for distributing leaflets deemed insulting to\nIslam. This attack comes after a deadly attack on\na minority Muslim sect in West Java. These attacks\nwere condemned by the both the US ambassador to\nIndonesia and the Indonesian President. Indonesia\nis the world\u2019s largest Muslim nation and is a secular state. However, religious minorities have been\nunder increasing attack by hard-line Islamist groups\nand the Indonesian Government stands accused of\ndoing too little to protect the rights of all citizens.\nIndonesia\nThe US is bracing itself for yet another winter\nstorm barely a week after a record-breaking storm\nroared across the American heartland. It is forecast\nto dump up to 8 inches of snow in Arkansas and\nOklahoma and could affect up to 150 million people\nin 40 states. The US is still recovering from an earlier storm which saw hundreds of flights cancelled\nand highways closed. That storm may cost US insurers up to $1.4 billion.\nRussia\nDoku Umarov, the Chechen separatist leader, has\nclaimed responsibility for last month\u2019s bombing\nat Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo Airport which killed 36\npeople. Mr Umarov has said that the attack was in\nresponse to Russian \u2018crimes\u2019 in the Caucasus and\nthreatened more suicide attacks in pursuit of an\nindependent Muslim state in Russia\u2019s Caucasus re-gion. Mr Umarov is one of Russia\u2019s most wanted men\nand is the self styled \u2018Emir of the Caucasus Emirate\u2019. He has previously claimed responsibility for the\n2010 Moscow Metro bombings and the 2009 attack\non a train from Moscow to St Petersburg.\nLast year the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats seized power after the 2010 general election and since then the ruling coalition\nhas taken austerity measures, spreading the rumour that UK was on the fiscal brink. They cut\ngovernmental employment by 460,000 work-ers, and slashed public spending including the\neducational budget and infrastructure. They\nalso raised VAT from 17.5% to 20% this year,\nwhich is partly responsible for a rise in commodity prices. The Liberal Democrats, who\nhad pledged to vote against any rise in university tuition fees before the election, tripled the\nfees last December.\nNick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, claimed that when the coalition formed\nBritain was on the edge of bankruptcy. David\nCameron, the current Prime Minister, claimed\nthat the bond markets were demanding austerity and so if Britain did not introduce immediate cuts, we would lose the confidence of the\nbond markets. Debt hawks often say that debt\nrepayment is a cost to the country.\nReaders of Felix may be aware that the Deputy Prime Minister has told lies in terms of not\nonly tuition fees but also the fiscal state of this\ncountry in order to justify the coalition\u2019s poli-cies. Every schoolboy knows (or should know)\nthat a government cannot go into bankruptcy\nlike a private business. As long as Britain has\nits own currency, it has the power to print\nmoney. Governments can only be in default if\nthey have incurred debts in another currency,\nthat is, if they cannot finance their external\ncurrent account deficit (which includes interest paid abroad). Iceland, which has its own\ncurrency, Iceland Krona, was in default in\n2008 because they could not finance a large\namount of external debt. What about the U.K?\nAccording to George Irvin, a Guardian colum-nist, about 80 % of public borrowing is from\nthe domestic market- what economists call\nthe \u201cnon-bank public\u201d. To those who buy UK\ngovernment bonds \u2013 either directly or through\npension funds \u2013 British bonds are financial assets on which holders receive a payment totalling \u00a334bn per annum. The remaining 20% is\neither held by government departments or is\nowned by foreigners. Most public borrowing\nappears as liability on the government side of\nthe ledger, but as an asset on the ledger of domestic bondholders. Roughly speaking, there-fore, UK citizens are Britain\u2019s creditors, not\ndebtors.\nCameron\u2019s argument does not stand up either.\nPaul Krugman, who won the Nobel economics\nprize in 2008, says that Cameron has invented\n\u201cinvisible bond vigilantes\u201d which do not exist.\nActually the bond markets were demanding no\nsuch British austerity. They rather punish the\nmeasures Cameron has taken. UK citizens may\nwell remember who the last two countries were\nto be downgraded by the bond market. The\nanswer is Ireland and Spain, which took immediate austerity measures, that is, Cameronstyle. Indeed, the bond markets got angry, and\nU-turn ahead\nTomokazu Miyamoto\nthe interest rate of the Irish governmental bond\nsoared to 9% because these policies cause a\nserious recession. (There is an inverse relationship between bond valuation and interest rates;\nthe low rate means that the price of a bond is\nstable.)\nProf. Krugman said that the austerity measures by the Conservative/LibDem coalition\nhad a lot to do with ideology: they have used\nthe deficit an excuse to downsize the welfare\nstate. He said in a New York Times column:\n\u201cThe British government\u2019s plan is bold, say\nthe pundits \u2013 and so it is. But it boldly goes in\nexactly the wrong direction.\u201d\nHe also predicted that the Britain in 2011\nwould look like Britain in 1931 or the United\nStates in 1937, adding that premature fiscal\nausterity would lead to a renewed economic\nslump.\nA recent economic report is likely to confirm\nProf. Krugman\u2019s prediction. The Office of National Statistics said on 25th January that GDP\nfell 0.5 % in the previous quarter. George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, seems\nto continue his austerity measures, while the\nopposition counterpart Ed Balls said that Osborne must urgently re-think their reckless plan\nto cut the deficit too far and too fast. Concerned\nabout this country\u2019s economy, Balls required\nthe coalition to start prioritising growth and\njobs.\nJoseph Stiglitz, who won the Nobel economics prize in 2001, also criticises Osborne\u2019s fiscal policy. Britain, where the economy contracted in the fourth quarter, is already seeing\nthe fallout, he said at an investor conference in\nMoscow on 2nd February. He added that austerity measures adopted by the UK coalition\ngovernment were not justified.\nAlthough Cameron and Osborne often exaggerate the budget deficit of UK, referring to the\nPIIGS debt problems, the U.K\u2019s deficit problem is completely different from PIIGS. Unlike the UK or USA, Eurozone nations cannot\nprint money to pay their debts with their own\nwills; they cannot take advantage of devaluation in terms of export by expanding money\nsupply, either. It is the only European Central\nBank (ECB) that can conduct monetary policies in the Eurozone. Let\u2019s consider the current account balance from 2002 to 2009 for 4\ncountries: Germany, Iceland, Ireland and Norway. Germany was in surplus constantly, while\nIreland was in deficit due to disadvantageous\nexchange rate of the Euro. Iceland improved\nthe figure dramatically, and Norway kept a\nfavourable balance. Since the latter 2 do not\nbelong to the Eurozone, they can freely control\nmonetary base to make themselves more competitive in terms of export.\nThe coalition\u2019s austerity measures are not\njustified currently because UK has the power\nto take appropriate monetary policies. UK\ncitizens should be more sceptical about the coalition\u2019s statements. This country is going in\nexactly the wrong direction.\nGeorge Osborne selling the Big Issue? In 2015, we can make it happen\nIs the UK\u2019s economy going in the wrong direction?\nJoshua Yerrell\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

The placements\nprovide an experience of university life elsewhere\nand students get involved with a series of challenges in a new and exciting social setting. This year,\nstudents from Imperial, NUS, NTU and A*STAR will\nbe participating in Singapore, and students from Imperial, HKU and Shanghai Jiao Tong University will be\ntaking part in Hong Kong. Working in small groups,\nparticipants get to share ideas and practices: it\u2019s a\ngreat networking opportunity.\nTomasz Cwik, a 2nd year PhD student, in the Aeronautics department, took part in last year\u2019s pro-gramme. \u201cIt was very interesting to interact with the\nlocal students, getting an understanding of why this\npart of the world looks how it looks, and experiencing their lifestyle for a couple of weeks.\u201d\n\u201cThe group became good friends and we spent a\nlot of time together. During the day we worked on\nour individual research, while in the evenings we ate\ndifferent kinds of food and chilled together.\u201d\n\u201cThe course was also a great opportunity for establishing useful research contacts at other univer-sities. You should not hesitate to sign up!\u201d\nFatma Dogan, a 2nd year Chemistry student who\ntook part last year, said: \u201cI hadn\u2019t been to Asia be-fore, so it was also a really good opportunity for me\nto meet with Asian students: Singaporeans, Chinese, people I wouldn\u2019t have met otherwise. It creates a global scientific network.\u201d\n\u201cWe discussed our projects with others from different fields: it was interesting because you had a\nbanker and a marine biologist working together! It\nbroadens your horizons and makes you realise that\nyou can collaborate with others no matter their field\nis.\u201dThe opportunities are open to all students in the\nfirst 18 months of their PhD who have not attended\nthe Graduate Schools RSD course.\nFor more information and to apply, please see:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/international/students/inter-nationalopportunities/summerschools2\nNEWS\nFELIX\n4\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 11 february 2011\nUnion: Minimum English\nrequirement should rise\nImperial College Union has revealed its response to the government\u2019s student visa consultation with a mixed response to the suggested proposals.\nAs reported last week, the 31st of January\nsaw the end of the consultation period for the\nreview of the United Kingdom\u2019s student immigration system. Launched by immigration\nminister Damian Green on the 7th of December\n2010, the public consultation aimed to receive\nopinions on several proposals put forward\nabout the reform of the \u2018Tier 4\u2019 visa \u2013 or the\ninternational entry route to study in the UK.\nGreen explained the motivation behind such\nproposals to the House of Commons in December: \u201cThe government is committed to\nminimising abuse of the student route by those\nwhose primary motivation is not to study but\nto work and settle in the UK.\u201d This followed\nthe Home Office publishing statistics which\nstate that 41% of students coming through the\nTier 4 route were studying below degree level\ncourses.\nThe Union\u2019s submission to the visa consultation was formed by a group of student representatives \u2013 including Union President Alex\nKendall, Deputy President (Welfare) Charlotte\nIvison and Deputy President (Education) Alex\nDahinten. Ivison explained to Felix how the\nprocess was carried out: \u201cWe had a number of\nmeetings where we read through the consultation documents and discussed how we thought\nwe should respond, and we talked to the InterMatt Colvin national Office for College\u2019s views.\u201d\n\u201cWe then brought our submission to Union\nCouncil, where it was discussed, amended and\npassed.\u201d\nStudents were encouraged by the Union to\nfill out the consultation submission as indi-viduals, with the form existing as a free online\nsurvey, alongside Damian Green\u2019s encouraging\nresponse \u201cfrom a wide range of people\u201d during a speech to the House of Commons at the\nlaunch of the consultation.\nAmong the proposals that the Union agreed\nwith include the suggestion that the minimum\nEnglish requirement should be raised and that\nhighly accredited sponsor institutions should\nbe allowed to offer below degree level courses,\nbut the Union also offers its own suggestion\nthat \u2018these institutions should be given 1-2\nyears to become highly accredited.\u2019\nInformation from the Home Office provides\ndetails on the Government\u2019s proposed minimum level of English, B2. This \u2018upper intermediate level\u2019 of English requires the learner\nto be conversant on a wider range of topics and\nequates to approximately 150 more hours of\nstudy than the lower level in place currently;\nB1, which focuses on understanding public announcements and instructions.\nHowever, the Union found fault with several of the government\u2019s proposals. Charlotte\nIvison explained to Felix the reasoning behind\nparticularly disagreeing with the suggested closure of the Post Study Work route, which currently allows students to stay for 2 years after\ntheir course in order to find skilled work, by\narguing that \u201cthis leaves international students\nwith four months in which to find work, which\nwe think is unacceptable.\u201d\nRegarding the proposal that recommends\nstudents to return home in order to apply for\nother courses, Ivison argues that, \u201cdoing so\nwould potentially incur significant personal\nexpenditure, deterring would be applicants, as\nwell as being incredibly wasteful.\u201d\n\u201cWe disagree with the proposal that if students want to remain in the country to study\nan additional course after their first one, that\nthey should have to provide evidence of academic progression, as this would limit those\nwho choose to swap degrees or do a second,\nunrelated degree.\u201d\nAnother contentious issue was that of students being required to prove academic progression in order to take further courses, with\nIvison pronouncing that \u201cthis doesn\u2019t allow for\nstudents wishing to take courses at the same\nlevel \u2013 switching courses or taking a second\nBSc for example.\u201d\nWhatever the Union\u2019s response, or indeed\nany of the 30,000 other replies to the consulta-tion, the fate of student visas now lies in the\nhands of the government. With the results of\nthe consultation expected to be released in\nApril, it won\u2019t be long before international students discover whether the process for studying in the UK will be helped or hindered.\n\u201cDeterring Internationals\u201d \u2013 Page 6. Ksenia\nRostislavleva argues that the government\u2019s\nvisa proposals risk catastrophe.\n\u00a33,000 reduction for poor students\nthat Cambridge intends to make the \u00a39,000\nfee grade the norm: \u201cThe level of tuition fee\ncharged from 2012 entry should be the maximum permissible, i.e. \u00a39,000 per annum with\nany subsequent adjustment for inflationary increases.\u201d\nThe University\u2019s line of defence is also of\nparticular interest as it rationalises that settling for lower fees might risk putting Cambridge\u2019s reputation in jeopardy as this \u201cmight\nraise questions about our commitment to excellence since a reduced fee in the long term could\nonly be sustained by reducing costs and hence\nquality\u201d . The report further justifies its decision by stating that it expects \u2018most, if not all\u2019\nother universities to follow Cambridge\u2019s lead.\nThis statement also happens to be in perfect\ncoherence with Aaron Porter, the NUS President\u2019s comments, when questioned about Cambridge\u2019s decisions.\n\u201cIt comes as absolutely no surprise that Cambridge University intends to charge students\nthe maximum amount it is permitted to [...] We\ncan now expect a race to the top as universities rush to gain kudos by joining the \u2018\u00a39,000\ngroup\u2019 as quickly as possible. How long before\nthe most expensive universities start asking for\nthe freedom to charge even more?\u201d\nTo counter the inevitable problem of students\nbelonging from poor backgrounds being \u2018put\noff\u2019 from applying, Cambridge has announced\nits own fee waiver and bursary plans, according to which students belonging to households\nwith an annual income of less than \u00a325,000\nwould be offered a \u00a33,000 fee reduction, hence\nresulting in a net \u00a36000 fee per annum. A bur-sary of \u00a31,625 has also been declared which\nwould proportionally decrease and taper down\nto zero as household income increases from\n\u00a325,000 to \u00a342,000.\nWith the deadline (31st march) for submission of Universities\u2019 2012 fee structures looming close, it is expected that many Universities will follow Cambridge\u2019s footsteps and\nannounce their fee decisions in the coming\nweeks. Oxford University have also initiated\ntheir fee-fixing process this past week by organising a debate between academics and the\nUniversity governing body and have hinted\nthat they will opt for the maximum as well.\nAs expected, the situation has resulted in\ngrowing tensions and an exponential increase\nin the amount of parents expressing their concerns over their children\u2019s future. A recent\nsurvey conducted on a total of 3000 people\nby ING Direct found that up to 10% had increased the amount they were saving for their\nchildren\u2019s University expenses, with a further\n13% going as far as setting up a \u2018University\nfund\u2019.\n...Continued from Front Page\nUmair Aasem\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA\nhh, cosplay. There\u2019s nothing I\nlike more than putting on my\nrobe and wizard hat, striding\nround the Queen\u2019s Lawn and\nwaving about my enormous\nmagical staff, casting spells of such power that\nmere mortals can only gasp in awe. Then, some\nkilljoy policeman arrests me for public inde-cency, or something like that.\nOh right, this is a review, my bad. So, Magicka. Magicka is a\u2026 well, I\u2019m not quite sure\nwhat genre it fits into, but action-adventure/\nquasi-RPG probably does it justice. Developed\nby Arrowhead Game Studios, Magicka is one\nbig parody from start to finish, satirizing RPGs\nand drawing heavily from a variety of cultural\nreferences including, but not limited to: internet memes, the Zelda game series and the British classic, Monty Python.\nI\u2019m not usually a fan of RPGs, in much the\nsame way that I\u2019m not the world\u2019s greatest fan\nof strychnine, so I was initially a little hesitant\nto start playing Magicka. However, I am nothing if not open to new games and genres, so I\ndecided to give it a sporting chance, donning\nmy wizard robe and hat to get into character\nbefore loading it up.\nThe game revolves around combining eight\ndifferent magical elements \u2013 Water, Cold,\nLightning, Arcane, Earth, Fire, Life and Shield\n\u2013 into spells. These elements can be cast alone\nor, for greater effect, combined in different and\ninteresting ways. For example, Fire will cast...\nwell, fire, but combine Fire and Water and you\nget their proud bastard child Steam. Likewise,\nthe Earth element fires off boulders but combine it with Fire and you get FIREBALLS.\nThere are also Magicks, which you \u2018learn\u2019\nby finding spell books scattered about the land.\nThese are not regular attacks, but special elemental combinations that have to be cast with\na separate button for a special effect. For exam-ple, Life and Lightning will combine to resurrect fallen comrades, and Water and Steam will\nsummon a temporary rainstorm. The driving\nforce behind the game is very much the discovery of all the different elemental combos, with\na generic \u2018follow a linear pathway and kill the\nevil boss\u2019 \u2013 which in itself satirises most other\nRPGs \u2013 binding everything together.\nMagicka feels very much a game for people\nwith a lot of enthusiasm and time to spend exploring its every nuance, spell and secret area,\nbecause there are a lot of them. The few hours I\ncould snatch playing it were far from sufficient\nto explore every spell combo and in the end I\npulled a Darth Sidious and spammed forked\nflaming lightning everywhere like it was going\nout of fashion.\nThis brings me very neatly to my first gripe.\nYou may have a huge array of spells to pick\nfrom, but when a group of goblins/wizards/\ngolems/resurrected skeletal warriors are bearing down upon you, there\u2019s no time to summon\nup fancy spells or Magicks \u2013 you pick the simple yet effective stuff and spam it relentlessly.\nThis problem only intensifies when the screen\nis visually cluttered, and fine control of your\nspells is nigh impossible. A popup tip tells you\nthat you can see what spells others are casting and use that information against them, but\nit\u2019s a filthy lie. I couldn\u2019t tell the small floating magical particles apart in the maelstrom of\nchaos I was embroiled in; it was far simpler to\njust fry everything with fire lightning.\nCo-op mode only exacerbates the problem.\nIgnoring the fact every server I found was\nlaggy as hell and finding games was an exercise in frustration, I could no longer shoot bolts\nof burning energy about without torching at\nleast one, or more often, all, of my colleagues,\nwhich put a bit of a damper on the whole ex-perience. As someone put it: \u201cCo-op is fun to\n\u2018n00b\u2019 about in.\u201d Finesse is rudely booted out\nthe window and you spend more time resurrecting allies than slaying enemies. It\u2019d take a\ngood connection and three dedicated friends to\nget me to play co-op regularly and quite frank-ly, I abandoned all forms of human contact\nyears ago in favour of becoming a heartless\njaded bastard (read gamer).\nI guess now you\u2019re looking towards me for\na recommendation; I really wish you weren\u2019t.\nMagicka is a very mixed bag. If you enjoy\nRPGs and want something brightly coloured\nand light-hearted, Magicka is a \u2018nice\u2019 game\nthat would be well worth the green stuff. If\nyou\u2019re like me and RPGs aren\u2019t quite for you,\nbe prepared to invest a fair amount of time adjusting to the controls since you can\u2019t just hop\nin and expect everything to run smoothly.\nDid I have fun? Initially, no, I didn\u2019t, but that\nwas down to the time I had to spend getting\nadjusted to the controls. Will I keep playing it?\nI think so. Magicka is a half-decent game that\ncertainly deserves at least a few more hours of\nmy time, and it\u2019s not like I want to get good\nmarks on my coursework anyway!\nMagicka is available now from Paradox Interactive and Arrowhead Game Studios.\nA mad, mixed bag of tricks\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser.

It has sushi \u2013 with faces. Oh, and it\u2019s\nJapanese. That should be all you need to know that\nthis is cutest, most kawaii game you\u2019re ever likely to\nplay on this side of the world. Sushi Cat is on a mission to rescue his beloved, but he\u2019s going to have to\neat a bucketful of sushi first. Drop the bouncy kitty\nand watch him nom is way through the sashimi and\ntofu. Brilliant!\nThe gameplay isn\u2019t exactly challenging, but it\ndoesn\u2019t need to be. Collecting the light bites is, for\nsome reason, enjoyable enough and extremely ad-dictive. Graphics too are a highlight, with the some\nof the highest-quality visuals it\u2019s possible to find in\na Flash game.\nFinally, a bit of originality in the zombie genre! In this\nisometric strategy game, you play the leader of a\ngroup of apocolypse survivors trying their damndest\nto stay alive. This isn\u2019t just about killing zombies,\npeople need food, medicine and happiness, and it\u2019s\nyour job to find them those things.\nBeing able to completely customise the fort is a\ngreat feature, and the huge scope for expansion\nmakes everything much more interesting.

    "content": "Business Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFELIX 13\nBUSINESS\nIs Microsoft a dying firm?\nIn the world of Google and Apple, Rudolf Lai asks if there is a future for Microsoft\nT\nen years ago, Microsoft\u2019s\nproducts were synonymous\nwith personal comput-ing. The Internet was just\nstepping into households;\nApple narrowly escaped bankruptcy,\nand its computers were seen as luxurious goods made for designers. In a blink\nof an eye, Apple became the largest\ntechnology company in US by market\ncapitalization in May 2010; in 2009,\nGoogle attracted nearly two thirds of\nthe worldwide search volume through\nits search engine and its sister sites. All\nthat Microsoft seems to be doing is to\nfollow what everybody else has done:\nlaunching Bing after Google, releasing\nWindows 7 Mobile after Apple\u2019s iOS.\nIn fact, many people have declared that\nMicrosoft is \u201cdead\u201d.\nBut is that the case? Microsoft\u2019s\ndominance has long preceded the rise\nof Google and the comeback of Apple.\nFrom a multi-stage dividend discount\nmodel perspective, Microsoft should\nbe in its stable growth period (i.e. the\nlast stage of the model), hence it would\nbe perceived that Microsoft is not as\n\u2018trendy\u2019 or \u2018strongly growing\u2019 as the\nother two companies. Nonetheless, the\ntwo biggest elements of Microsoft\u2019s\nbusiness, the operating system and the\nOffice suite, still have significantly\ngreater market share than its competi-tors. The Windows operating system\nand Office make up 53% and 42% of\nMicrosoft\u2019s 2010 revenues respec-tively. As of December 2010, Windows\nhad about 85% share of the operating\nsystems market, and Office has 94%\nmarket share, according to Gartner. In\ncontrast, Google\u2019s business is largely\ninternet-based; around 70% of Apple\u2019s\n2010 revenue is from mobile computing\nproducts like the iPhone, iPod, and the\niPad, and the rest are in its OS and Mac\nhardware. One could argue Google and\nApple\u2019s recent stardom is mostly based\non a combination of new technologies,\nlike faster internet connections, cloud\ncomputing, and mobile computing, and\nthat Microsoft\u2019s traditional playgrounds\nof the OS and the Office suite remains\nrelatively unscathed.\nMicrosoft still has its competitive advantage in the OS and Office area, and\nit has entered the gaming console mar-ket, which neither Apple nor Google\nhave access to. Undoubtedly, Apple and\nGoogle are trying their best to step into\nthe OS and business productivity application territory. For example, from\nApple we have the OSX and iOS operating systems, and the iWorks office suite;\nfrom Google we have internet-focused\nsoftware like the Chrome OS, Google\nMail and Google Docs. Just by the num-bers, however, we can see that there is a\nlong way to go before we can even say\nthat there is major competition in the OS\nand Office markets.\nCorporations and businesses are one\nof Microsoft\u2019s major sources of rev-enue. The prime reason for corporations to stay with Windows is Microsoft Excel. Excel\u2019s variety of functions,\nand the extent of which these functions\nare implemented, is unparalleled in\nthe commercial electronic spreadsheet\nmarket. Specifically, equipped with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and\nnow .NET, Excel offers the possibility for programmers and developers to\nembed code directly into spreadsheets.\nThrough the embedded code, a spreadsheet can offer functions that manipulate\ndata in ways normally impossible using\nstandard spreadsheet operations. In a\nway, Excel is like the Apple App store\nfor business and finance. It provides a\ncommon platform on which software\nhouses can develop and release appli-cations, and the spreadsheet format is a\nwidely understood input method. From\noption pricing tables, to portfolio optimization software, Excel offers an easy\nway to represent the input and outputs\nof mathematical models or other number\ncrunching engines.\nOn a related note, a second reason that\nbusinesses are reluctant to change from\nWindows to another operating system is\nthe cost of switching to others. Corporations have invested a lot of resources\ninto supporting a Windows oriented\ninfrastructure. They have hired .NET\nand VBA developers, and made custom\napplications that only run on Windows.\nThey have trained their staff to use Excel, the Office suite, and VBA. They\nhave virtual desktop systems devoted\nto delivering a Windows environment\nto a new computer or a new user in a\nmatter of hours. Costs aside, there is just\nlittle reason for corporations to switch to\nanother operating system that does not\nrun Excel natively, and one that requires\nre-training staff. As such, Microsoft will\ncontinue to reap sales from new versions\nof Office and Windows. In 2009, a new\nversion of Windows was released, and\nas of 2010 it has sold 175 million cop-ies, making it the fastest-selling operating system in the world.\nMicrosoft is also strong in is the gaming market. Arguably, the iOS platform\nfrom Apple also provides a platform\nfor gaming, but due to the nature of the\nhardware, the range of games cannot be\nconsidered a direct competitor to the\nXbox franchise. Xbox has performed\nwell relative to other major consoles:\nsales of video games and other software\nfor the Xbox 360 topped $3 billion in\n2010, topping the Nintendo Wii (at $2.6\nbillion) and Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3 (at\n$2.1 billion), reports a NPD Group market research.\nA gaming console is largely dependant on the games that are played on it.\nIn November 2010, Microsoft released\nthe \u201ccontroller-free gaming and entertainment experience\u201d Kinect for Xbox,\nwhich triggered a wave of new games\ntaking advantage of the new hardware.\nGame/software sales for the Xbox 360\nrose 29% in December 2010, compared\nto the same month the previous year, according to the BMO report on the NPD\nnumbers. The introduction of Kinect\nputs Xbox in direct competition with the\nWii in terms of using body movements\nfor input, but the absence of a physical\ncontroller for Kinect may prove to induce a greater variety of games developed for the device in the long run.\nAdmittedly, under the guidance of\nSteve Jobs,Apple seems to be delivering\nhit product after hit product. Google, on\nthe other hand, seems to be permeating\nevery aspect of our cyber life. In the vast\nindustry of technology, we cannot say\nthat Microsoft has its monopoly over the\nbusiness like it did. But we can attribute\nthat change to a shift in the boundaries of the tech industry, rather than an\nabsolute shrinkage of Microsoft\u2019s busi-ness. With the recent uprising of what is\ncalled the \u2018closed internet\u2019 \u2013 Facebook\n\u2013 a network that Google has no access\nto, and the health concerns surrounding\nthe Apple CEO, the scoreboard of tech\ngiants is still undecided.\nFriday 11 February 2011\nOn the 15th of February, McKinsey &\nCompany will visit Imperial College to\nlaunch \u201cMcKinsey Students in Society\n2011,\u201d a new social enterprise business\nplan competition for university students\nacross the United Kingdom.\nThe competition offers a unique opportunity for students to develop their\nbusiness skills while seeking to make a\nreal difference to society or their local\ncommunities.\nTo participate, teams of 3-6 undergraduates from UK universities will\nsubmit business plans for social enterprises \u2013 financially sustainable businesses which are run to benefit society.\nLaunch events in Imperial College\nwill kick off at 6pm on Tuesday 15th\nFebruary in the Skempton Building,\nRoom 301.\nThe first round is a simple online pro-cess. Students have to submit a compelling business idea and describe what\nits impact would be on society. From\nthese submissions, six national finalists\nwill be selected to develop their ideas in\ngreater detail.\nThese national finalists will receive\nfurther coaching to develop their plans\nin preparation for the National Final in\nLondon, in April 2011.\nThe winning team will receive seed\nfunding for their business and ongoing\nsupport from McKinsey consultants to\nhelp get their idea off the ground.\nLaunching the competition, Kevin\nSneader, Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company in the UK, said \u201cThere\nis no motivation more powerful than\nto make a positive lasting difference to\nthe world around us by developing and\nimplementing a visionary business idea.\nI hope this competition will help encourage the next generation of entrepreneurs\nwith the vision to transform society for\nthe better.\u201d\nTom Rippin, CEO of social enterprise\nOn Purpose, commented, \u201cSocial enterprises promise to help solve many of the\nmost challenging issues society faces to-day. Politicians, the media and investors\nare showing ever-greater levels of interest in this potential. If social enterprises\nare to fulfil these expectations, it is imperative that they also attract the most\nexceptional people to be the leaders of\ntomorrow. It\u2019s great to see this initiative\nto get the best and brightest students engaged!\u201d\nInitial submissions can be made online from now until Sunday 13th of\nMarch at msis.mckinsey.com\nMcKinsey Students in Society contest announced\nI don\u2019t care if Macs are \u2018stylish\u2019, Steve Jobs is a certified fashion disaster...\n\n"

    "content": "16\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nP\nresident Mubarak is currently in quite a mess and just\nabout clinging on to power.\nThe government resigned,\non his request, and a new\none has formed and held talks with opposition parties about the constitution.\nMubarak has even banned some members of the political elite from travelling\nabroad. I assume a similar ban is imposed on people living in Birmingham,\notherwise that place would be a ghost\ntown, but I digress. The point is, I think\nit\u2019s a fairly non\u2013controversial statement\nto say that Egypt\u2019s president Mubarak is\ncurrently under fire. By which I mean\nmetaphorically, don\u2019t worry; you didn\u2019t\nmiss anything big on YouTube.\nThere has been widespread violence\nbetween demonstrators and the authori-ties. UN General Secretary Ban Kimoon has weighed in on this saying: \u2018I\nonce again urge restraint to all the sides.\nAn unacceptable situation is happening.\nAny attack against the peaceful demonstrators is fucking unacceptable and\nI strongly condemn the fuck out of it.\nFor fuck\u2019s sake Egypt, first Tunisia now\nthis. Oh and to add to this the shit\u2019s really hitting the fan in Yemen. Can\u2019t I just\nget one day off! That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking,\nthis shit is stressful. I\u2019m off to scream\ninto a pillow and cry if anyone needs\nme. Which I\u2019m sure they fucking well\nwill judging by the last few days.\u2019 That\nisn\u2019t a 100% accurate direct quote; the\nswearing and last few sentences were\njust implied.\nMubarak has been a dictator for\nyears. So long, that it\u2019s a miracle he\ndoesn\u2019t have a moustache yet. The facial hair worn exclusively by dictators\nand people in London who think they\nare edgy and different (ie. exclusively\ndickheads). He reached the point where\ngigantic posters of him are all over the\nplace; must have cost an absurd amount\nof printing credits. That may be hard to\npicture for us \u2013 just think of David Cameron before the election but with, hope-fully, less airbrushing.\nHe recently gave an interview with\nABC news. During this he said that\nhe would \u2018never run away\u2019 and that he\n\u2018will die on this soil.\u2019 Perhaps, more\ncorrectly, he will die on the expensive\nItalian marble that he obtained using\nmoney that should have been used else-where. This quote could be seen as a\ndig at former Tunisian President Zine\nEl Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Dubai\nduring the recent protests. I highly doubt\nBen Ali will care though. It\u2019s not like the\ntwo will get into a viscous twitter feud.\nMainly because Ben Ali probably does\nnot remotely miss power due to his massive personal fortune. Reports say his\nwife took out 1.5 tonnes of gold, worth\nabout \u00a338 million, from the bank before\nleaving. That really is some absolutely\ntextbook corruption. In the slightly altered words of another recently deposed\nfigure, Andy Gray, take a bow ma\u2019am.\nSaying that, roughly half will be used to\npay the extra baggage fee when she flew\nout so it\u2019s not as much as you think.\nMubarak thinks that if he leaves now\nit would be \u2018chaos\u2019. I think it\u2019s safe to\nassume he doesn\u2019t read newspapers or\neven look outside his window. He clearly means that, you know, riots, protestors\nbeing killed, that shit would go down\nwithout him. Luckily he\u2019s still there so\nnone of that is happening. On that note,\nthe protestors said they would storm the\npresidential palace if he doesn\u2019t resign.\nThey say that, but I had a look on Facebook and most people responded \u2018maybe attending.\u2019 We all know that\u2019s code\nWhat a dick\u2013tator\nfor one of a) \u2018I\u2019ll decide on the day but\nprobably wont\u2019, b) \u2018I\u2019m not attending\nbut am too polite to click not attending\u2019.\nThe interview wasn\u2019t all impassion-ate rhetoric. He actually seemed a bit\nblas\u00e9 about the whole being in power\nthing. He stated that he is \u2018fed up\u2019 and\nthat he has \u2018had enough\u2019 and wants to\ngo. I guess after many years doing the\nsame job it must all be a bit samey. The\nthing is, being a dictator is like a pet. It\u2019s\nfor life, not just for Christmas. He needs\nto remember that everyone loves an un-derdog, he should listen to \u2018Eye of the\nTiger\u2019 and run up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. At this point,\nit seems that he is not going to run for\noffice in the next election, which is due\nin September. He found time to mention\nhis son in the interview, saying \u2018I never\nintended Gamal to be president after\nme\u2019. I\u2019m guessing he is like my dad; being president isn\u2019t good enough, if his\nson isn\u2019t a doctor or a lawyer he is a\nfailure (by the way I do Chemistry). His\nson was actually sitting in the room with\nhim at the time, but didn\u2019t say anything\n\u2013 probably on Facebook scanning the\npro\u2013Mubarak rally events for hotties.\nMubarak clinging to power has become pathetic. It\u2019s time\nhe got a life. Even Ban Ki\u2013Moon is getting pissed off...\nAs the elections grow ever closer and each\nof the Union\u2019s Sabbaticals offers an account\nof their experiences and some advice for\nwould-be successors, the arrogant urge to\ndo the same has become uncontrollable.\nIt would be farcical to interview oneself so\nI shall instead substitute what is usually a\nspace to editorialise on \u201cthe issue of the\nday\u201d with some words of advice for the man\nor woman that will follow me.\nOf the many things of which I was not\naware when I began the job, there are two\nthings that are certainly the most important.\nThe first is the ever-present sense of fa-tigue. An average day usually begins between 8-9am and ends between 7-9pm. The\nWednesday/Thursday \u201csprint finish\u201d is even\nworse, I begin at 8am on Wednesday, work\nuntil 3-5am at which time I take a short nap\non the office couch and awake at 6am; I finally rest my head upon a pillow at 10-11pm\non Thursday evening. The weekend only offers rest if you\u2019re willing to forgo social inter-action; I have not been willing. So it is hardly\nsurprising that the bags under my eyes have\ngrown considerably. If you are considering\ntaking the helm of this illustrious newspa-per, do not deceive yourself about the physical toll that it will take. You could work fewer\nhours, of course, but then the paper would\nsuffer \u2013 if that is a compromise that you\u2019re\nwilling to make, then I doubt that the position is right for you.\nThe second is how much the paper\u2019s success is carried, not by the Editor, but by students who volunteer their time to contribute\nto it. They are the ones who come up with\nnew ideas, write the articles, edit and lay\nout the paper and exceed your expectations\neach and every week. It is the dedicated\nstudent volunteers, not the Editor, who are\ntruly the lifeblood of this paper. For that\nreason the Editor must encourage Imperial\nstudents to participate in the production of\ntheir newspaper and must help them shape\nit with their ideas. If Felix isn\u2019t completely\nopen and welcoming to those students who\ntentatively and modestly request the opportunity to write an article, it will suffer.\nTo finish, I\u2019ll recount something that I did\nknow when I started and still hold as key to\nthe job six months on: there is no use in trying to hide your mistakes or shortcomings.\nI have made errors of judgement and there\nare things, though I am too ashamed to list\nthem here, that I regret. But this already difficult job \u2013 see lack of sleep above \u2013 would\nbe impossible without the humility to say\nthat the next girl, or guy, could probably do a\nfar better job than me.\nFELIX\nTim Arbabzadah\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nA few words of advice for\nthose considering running\nfor Felix Editor\nStop hogging the stage! Man, dictators are so freaking self-centred...\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nC omment Editor: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\n\u201c\n\u201c\ne so freaking self-c\n\u201d\nThe thing is, being a dictator is\nlike a pet.

On\nthe 27th January KnitSock (witty pun\nintended) celebrated its 3rd Birthday\nwith a healthy membership and personalised birthday cake to prove those scep-tics wrong. But KnitSock is just one of\nthe many success stories in the midst of\na craft renaissance.\nOver the past 10 years or so, the craft\nscene has been changing drastically and\nis no longer soley the preserve of the\nWomen\u2019s Institute and Girl Guides. Part\nof that reputation came from an era of\nnecessity with poster boards filled with\nmottos like \u2018Our Jungle Fighters Want\nSocks. Please Knit Now\u2019, and the absence of TV. During peace times knitting was also a huge industry producing\nvast quantities of knitwear before the\nIndustrial revolution took over with automated knitting machines.\nNow the tables have turned: vast factories in far flung places could render\nthe craft obsolete as cheaper as quicker\nproduction is plentiful and accessible.\nAnd yet a rising trend in craft popularity suggests otherwise. Men and women,\nyoung and old are bucking the trend of\nquick, disposable fixes from Primark in\nfavour of something that represents significant time and effort, but also something meaningful. Even celebrities like\nMadonna, Kristen Davis and Geri Halliwell have been spotted working the\nHappy 3rd Birthday, KnitSoc!\nJennifer Wilson looks back at a society that has defied expectations\nIt\u2019s coming to the end of our second Sexual Health Awareness (SHAG) week,\nand that means you\u2019re nearly free of\n\u2018The Guilt\u2019. The Guilt of not speaking to\nthe lovely people handing out condoms,\nlube and information, that your eye is\nalways drawn to before quickly looking away like an embarrassed school\ngirl. The Guilt of not getting tested\neven though you think to yourself daily\n\u201cyou know what, I should get tested for\nChlamydia, there was that one skanky\nlooking girl last week\u201d. The Guilt of understanding the biology of most STD\u2019s\nbetter than any charity, and yet never\nhaving been tested for any of them.\nI understand the feeling you\u2019re hav-ing, I can relate well. I\u2019ve had my fair\nshare of sexual \u2018faux-pas\u2019in the past and\nignored all the posters and advertisements basically telling me that I\u2019ve got\nevery disease known to man. I was once\nafraid of going to the clinic and telling\nthem anything about me, let alone give\na urine sample to the doctors like they\nwere a vampire with an odd fetish.\nHowever I\u2019m going to stand up and\nsay \u201cHi, I\u2019m Stuart, and I\u2019m a reformed\nIatrophobic\u201d (Google does wonders for\nyour vocabulary!). I can now stand up\nand proudly say \u201cI\u2019ve been tested, I\u2019m\nclean!\u201d\nWe live in an age where our sex is\ngood, and our STD\u2019s are even bet-ter. They are can be silent and deadly,\nthey could give you unsightly spots\nand blemishes, some will even leave no\nsymptoms until you find out 6 months\nlater that you\u2019re completely infertile.\nI\u2019m not here to scare you and chase you\nall into the John Hunter Sexual Health\nClinic dressed as giant Human Immunodeficiency Virus, nor am I here\nto comfort you and tell you nothing is\nwrong with having unprotected sex with\nevery man, woman and inanimate object\nwho\u2019ll give you a drunken nod or a beer-goggled wink. All that I\u2019m saying is that\nthere should always be a few things you\nshould take into account while you\u2019re\nout on the pull.\nI\u2019m certainly not one to say that abstinence is the way forward either. To deny\nyour basic human instincts to leap on top\nof the next appropriate person you see\nis a fallacy in itself. What I\u2019m trying to\nput across is that if you are leaping from\nperson to person, that you need to keep\nyour health and that of the many people\nyou leave in your wake at the forefront\nof your thought. Wearing protection and\ngetting regular tests (I get tested once\nevery 6 months if you want something\nto aim for) should be your main preroga-tives.\nAs Aldous Huxley once said \u201can Intellectual is a person who\u2019s found that one\nthing that\u2019s more interesting then sex\u201d ...\nI certainly haven\u2019t found it, and I doubt\nI ever will.\nStaying sexually healthy needn\u2019t be\na chore. Right are two nearby clinics\nthat won\u2019t leave you feeling awkward.\nneedles.\nKnitting wouldn\u2019t be so popular in the\nfirst place if it was as difficult as some\nperceive it to be. My mantra is \u2018if a\ngranny can do it, and you go to Imperial,\nit can\u2019t be that hard\u2019. In actual fact it\u2019s\na relaxing endeavour and ideal for commuting or long journeys, and at the very\nleast saves you from staring blankly at\ntube posters trying to sell you car insur-ance.\nFor the devoted Imperialite, knitting\nand its close relative, crochet, both have\nan intrinsic mathematical appeal. In\n1997 Dr Daina Tamina, a Latvian mathematician at Cornell University, USA\neven chose to express hyperbolic space\nthrough the medium of crochet and mobius models are easy to do even by accident when knitting.\nNow in its third year, like a good un-dergraduate, KnitSock has a great foundation and is aspiring to grow further.\nIt hosts themed lessons on a fortnightly\nbasis and on the alternate weeks we\nhave a chance to progress with our own\nprojects with help close at hand. With\nlots of new exciting yarns, knitting is\nno longer doomed to the embarrassing\nChristmas jumpers of yesteryear and\nnew designers are keeping up to date\nwith latest trends. The club has a supply of yarn and needles, and we\u2019ll endeavour to teach anyone whatever they\nwant to know within the craft world, so\nthere are no pre-requisites. Everyone is\nwarmly invited to come along and give\nit a go.\nJohn Hunter Clinic for Sexual Health\nThis is the closest (and in my opinion best) clinic to Imperial College\nstudents, who they deal with on a\nregular occasion.\n369 Fulham Road, Chelsea, Greater\nLondon, SW10 9NH, 020 8846 6699\nAppointments: 020 3315 6699, Advisors: 020 3315 6155/6156\nWalk-in Clinics: Monday: 9 \u2013 10:30am,\nTuesday: 5 \u2013 6:30pm\nwww.chelwest.nhs.uk/jhc/\nWest London Centre for Sexual\nHealth\nThey have a women\u2019s only clinic every other Wednesday between 1:30\n\u2013 7:00pm, which is suited to women\u2019s issues.\nGround Floor, South Wing of Charing\nCross Hospital, Fulham Palace Road,\nLondon, W6 8EP.\n020 8846 6699\nwww.chelwest.nhs.uk/wlcsh\nGet tested.

    "content": "18 felix\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow clips from Hollywood\nmovies could liven up\nnews footage\nAs news breaks at 7am about a man fighting\nthe Russian airforce in the Indian Ocean, the\nBBC use live footage. They cut to Tom Cruise\ncelebrating victory after shooting down all\nthe enemies, despite his sadness at the\nloss of his co-pilot.\nIt sounds bizarre, but in China it\u2019s actually\nhappened. Not to that extent perhaps, but\nthe use of scenes from Top Gun in a report\nabout missile tests is a comical deception.\nTo use archive footage would be one thing,\nbut to use footage from an eighties film is\nsomething else. It\u2019s taking a long walk off a\nshort plank; one step too far.\nWhat made them use it anyway? You\nwould expect a grainy amateur video camera recording from a bloke in a control tower,\nnot Tom Cruise pulling the same face every\nthree seconds in the vain hope of pulling his\nteacher. It\u2019s the kind of mistake a schoolboy\nwho\u2019s left his homework to the last minute\nmight make.\nThis made me think about what other situations could be covered with blockbuster\nfilm footage. There is a bit at the start of\nInception where there is a riot in an Arabian\ntown. This could be used as coverage of\nthe ongoing tensions in North Africa (and\nincreasingly the Middle East) about social\nliberty. Obviously, the bit where it cuts to Ken\nWatanabe and Leonardo DiCaprio would be\nremoved, leaving about ten seconds of useable footage, but I\u2019m sure if Kate Silverton\ntries her hardest she could rattle through\nthe brief encounter whilst acting as if it were\nreal.\nPearl Harbour could be used as \u2018brand new\nfootage\u2019 of the historical event. Obviously,\nthose astute members of society may notice\nthe fact it\u2019s in colour, it\u2019s all CGI, and Ben\nAffleck is an awful actor. The colour would\nprobably swing it towards being improbable,\nbecause it\u2019d be like sending Russell Howard\nto the court of Henry VIII; painfully funny\nnow, painfully disemboweled, emasculated\nand beheaded then.\nPerhaps if Nick Clegg was reluctant to do\na press conference you could show archive\nfootage of a boomerang, always going back\n(on it\u2019s promises, clever huh?) and then\nhave it get asked questions by a panel. Perhaps the panel itself could be from a press\nconference in a film.\nHowever, not from Iron Man, because unlike Robert Downey Junior, Nick Clegg is\ncertainly not an iron man. If anything he\u2019s\na toilet tissue boy. Flimsy, afraid of being\ndestroyed, full of crap. So, next time you\nwatch the news, which, if you\u2019re a student,\nwill be sometime in 2017, watch out for\nfootage that may not be what it\u2019s supposed\nto be.\nAnd no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s Fiona Bruce\u2019s\nreal face either.\nRob Cleaver\nDon\u2019t pity singles, pity me!\nI\nt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day pretty soon, as you\u2019ve no\ndoubt realised from the world\u2019s sudden desire\nto shape everything into hearts and paint itself\nred, and that can only mean one thing. It\u2019s time\nto feel unnecessarily awkward about being in\na relationship when other people aren\u2019t. Valentine\u2019s\nDay must be the only holiday that actively segregates\nthe population and hands out gold stars to one half of\nit. Even the bloody Christians let everyone else chuff\ndown chocolate come Easter time.\nI\u2019m not about to troop out that tired line about\nValentine\u2019s Day being extremely unfair on the poor\nlonely sods that litter London. Screw those guys. It\u2019s\nunfair on me. I get to double down on feelings of inadequacy and awkardness by simultaneously having\nto rub my relationship in everyone\u2019s faces all day, and\nthen feel bad whenever someone walks past with a\nmarginally larger bouquet of flowers. I\u2019m the dude\nvisiting famine\u2013stricken regions of China, only I\u2019m\nthere to attend a hotdog speed\u2013eating competition.\nIt\u2019s this state of panic that pisses me off. One minute\nI feel like I\u2019m dangling my sex life in the face of a\nsecond\u2013year Physics student, and the next I\u2019m being\ncock\u2013slapped by some bulky arsehole from Medicine. Do I put in my inflatable chest muscles when I\ndon my shirt? Or do I grab the dark glasses, stuff the\nmissus under my overcoat, and hope no\u2013one notices\nme sneaking into South Kensington? Either sound\nlike they\u2019d lead to a lawsuit. Or a fight.\nTo alleviate some of the panic this year, I will be attempting to go abroad for a few days with Mrs. Geek.\nThis will allow me to make up for any glaring cock\u2013\nups on the big day itself, whilst also putting me in\na sufficiently alien environment that I can\u2019t decipher\nthe whispers of disapproval when I completely misread the opportunity for romantic moments.\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, I plan to move to Columbia\nand stay there for six months of the year, as for some\nreason they only celebrate Valentine\u2019s in September.\nThis works for me, as I can set up my continent\u2013spanning crime ring and get to work on my people\u2013trafficking and corruption\u2013mongering skills in time for\nmy coup d\u2019etat around the time of the next general\nelection.\nI\u2019ve been assured by most action films that there\u2019s\nnothing more romantic than a man in uniform, except\none being saluted by sixty million deferent semi\u2013loyal subjects. So claiming the throne of England would\nnot only be an extremely attractive gift that keeps\non giving, but I\u2019d also be able to outlaw any trace\nof the day for the foreseeable future. Thank me later,\nreaders.\nSo Happy Valentine\u2019s Day to you, Mrs. Geek. This\ntime next year, we\u2019ll be sunning ourselves among the\ncocaine factories, dreaming of a Britain where I have\nbanned the occasion altogether. Love you!\nAngry Geek\n\u201cTo alleviate the\npanic this year, I\nwill be attempting\nto go abroad with\nMrs Geek.\u201d\nRhys Davies\nDating tips? From this guy?\n\u201cTry to express\nyour sensitive side\n\u2013 or, if missing,\nfake one.\u201d\nO\nf all the highlights that come with\nevery lap the Earth makes around\nthe Sun, Valentine\u2019s Day I think is\nthe trickiest. For some, it\u2019s plain tire-some, as all media seem to gravitate\naround hearts and puppies and little naked children\nwith wings. On any other day, these things would\nrarely feature among your top interests, unless\nyou\u2019re a veterinary cardiologist...or a paedophile.\nBut for those you for whom it has become impor-tant, it is on a par with the worst Lovecraftian night-mare: finding that special someone (for 24 hours at\nleast), making reservations, rehearsing with painstaking precision your spontaneous wit for the even-ing, practising dance moves that suggest a basic\nunderstanding of rhythm, and at last, at the end of\nevening, scouring the whole of west London for a\nplace that sells...a puncture repair kit.\nI won\u2019t pretend to be some great Casanova. Rather\nthan cruise the hottest clubs for a bit of action, I find\nmy chances are more realistic if I hang out near the\nopticians. However, I still class myself as a romantic,\nno matter how hopeless. I believe in love, or something roughly approximate to it, is out for there for\neveryone. Strengthened by my delusion, I thought\nI might share some tips with the reluctant Romeos\namong you.\nFirstly, you need to make an impression. Whether\nyou are in the Union looking for love or it\u2019s your diamond anniversary, you have to make an effort to stand\nout. The girl by the bar will, I assure you, be tired\nof the same chat\u2013up lines and free drinks laced with\n\u201csugar.\u201d Just like in a job interview, you need an edge\nto catch her interest: wear a fez, make sexy chit\u2013chat\nin Esperanto, signal \u201cLarge Hadron Collider? I hardly\nknow her!\u201d in Morse code with the lights. Contrary to\npopular belief, luck does not favour the brave. Luck\nand love favour the clinically insane.\nNext, women like a man who can sweep them off\ntheir feet. I suggest you bring a broom. If nothing\nelse, you can use it to compare favourably with your\nown physique. Another trick would be to choose your\nattire for the evening and shrink it in the wash.Abody\nso ripped that it can hardly be contained is impres-sive, even if you are technically wearing children\u2019s\nclothes. Alternatively, dim the lights; it is well\u2013\nknown that there is an inverse correlation between\nthe amount of light in a room and romance.

Send us a tweet with #FelixTravel or drop\nus an email at travel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nW\nith a significant proportion\nof you currently being in a\n\u2018dry spell\u2019 (as highlighted\nby Felix\u2019s excellent sex\nsurvey) this article is probably irrelevant to a lot of you. But I urge those\nit concerns to take some of the key points on\nboard before hopping on the lovey-dovey travelling bandwagon. It takes some serious co-jones and a lot of hard work to properly pull\nit off.\nTravelling alone is liberating: you can embrace people and experiences no holds barred\nand do whatever you want. As soon as you\nnumb yourself with the morphine that is a\nfriendship circle you instantly limit yourself\nto the route plans that you\u2019ve probably had\nto compromise, because Gary doesn\u2019t see the\npoint of looking at some dumb old rocks made\nby some insignificant hill tribe. Well replace\nyour Gary with a Sophie and you\u2019ve got bigger\nproblems.\nTravelling together is a bit like moving in,\nbut a lot more intense. I guarantee that in sweltering heat and constantly in each other\u2019s detestable company you\u2019d soon rather be back on\nthe Piccadilly Line, scratching your arse with\nyour copy of the Metro, instead of gazing up at\nChrist the Redeemer.\nBon voyage to the budget\nOh sure, by shacking up and sharing a room\nit\u2019ll probably work out marginally cheaper over\nthe course of a long trip. I mean hey, you\u2019re\ngetting a room for two for less than the cost of\ntwo separate rooms, right? Well unfortunately\nthat\u2019s where the cost benefits of travelling as a\ncouple end. In fact, the above logic could probably apply to tagging along with a group of fun-loving Mexicans, or just sticking to much more\nsocial dorms.\nCouples like to do nice things. They like to\neat in fancy restaurants, opt in for the air condi-tioning, take a taxi over the filthy bus, and generally swim in that over-indulgent way of life\nlike they\u2019re better than the rest of us. So much\nfor budget travelling, eh? In spite of the pleas\nof \u2018hey, we can just go for the cheaper option!\u2019\nyou\u2019ll still find yourself compelled to fork out\non the fancy stuff regardless.\nAnd those dastardly looky-looky men that\nyou\u2019ve finally learnt to handle? They suddenly become a lot more ruthless. They see you\ncoming as a couple and treat you like you\u2019re\nthicker than the fat yank in the baseball cap beside you. Yes, the babbling idiot with the thick\nTexan accent who gets angry at the slum child\nfor not understanding him as he requests direc-tions, and inadvertently coats the young boy\nin flecks of spit when he speaks. You\u2019re now\non the same level as this guy. The looky-looky\nmen will bleed you dry and make you pay for\nyour monogamy.\nChris Richardson orders you to toss away the Valentine\u2019s\nDay courtesies, and consider travelling alone\nThe detestable royal \u201cwe\u201d\nAh, the royal \u201cwe\u201d. It\u2019s an inviting little comfort zone, isn\u2019t it? No need for the repeated trivial conversations with people on bus journeys\nnow, you can just further bow down to being\nthe travelling equivalent of a Fifties housewife.\nCouples are the most difficult group to interact with on the road \u2013 they\u2019re like, totally on\nanother level of understanding of each other\u2019s\nconsciousness: you wouldn\u2019t understand.\nOh sure, you might rock another look: you\u2019re\none of those chilled couples who pride themselves on being social with everyone in their\npath. Congratulations on breaking a tiring\nclich\u00e9, but don\u2019t expect anyone else to avoid\nthe stigma. While you may have overcome the\nstereotypes, people will still avoid you like the\nplague. If you travel as a couple, you come as\na package. To the people around you this package is a time bomb that they\u2019ll do everything\nto avoid.\nBickering and bus bathrooms\nThe following figures are from a real life case\nstudy. Young Jimmy spent three weeks on\nholiday with his girlfriend, took 500 photos, of\nwhich about two look worthy of appearing in a\nholiday brochure. Said two photos took ten seconds to pose for \u2013 ten seconds out of 1.8 million seconds spent on holiday. Yet those photos\nare for some reason always the emphasis.\nWhat the photos fail to capture are the countless bus journeys. You know the ones: the air-conditioning is causing your nipples to shrivel,\nandAustralian Bob has got a woozy tummy and\nhas decided to fill the toilet with the nauseating\ncontents of his bowels. Thanks a bunch, Bob,\nthanks. Anyway, your photos hopefully never\ncapture this, and if they should you should be\nmore conservative with your memory card.\nThe point is that the seeming romanticism\nalways generated by those snaps in Halong\nBay are really not so glamorous: the couple are\nprobably mid-argument, following a rather uncomfortable bus journey surrounded by Australian nutters. They say it\u2019s all about the journey,\nbut journeys of this sort can really detract from\nthe passion and bliss that you\u2019d come to ex-pect. It\u2019s much easier to have no expectations,\nno standards and nobody else to please.\nIn the wise words of LCD Soundsystem \u201cit\u2019s\ntime to get away, it\u2019s time to get away from\nyou\u201d. Keep your travelling options limitless.\nAnd if you\u2019re heading to South-east Asia,\nthere\u2019ll be plenty of ladyboys at your disposal\nanyway \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky you might even bag\nyourself a free STI!\nRuss\u2019 expression shows a combination of anger at Katy and a terrible case of the runs\nIt\u2019s nothing like this. You\u2019ll be on an uglier beach and never get to shag Brittany Murphy\nFELIX\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 11 february 2011\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSports Editors: Jovan Nedic\nDavid Wilson\nFelix Sports League\nsponsored by Handball: Close call for the\nEagles as they manage to\nfend off rivals UCL\nThere was not a single moment of calm in the\ngame that would determine the top seed in the\nLondon division of the Handball Development\nLeague.\nIt was already the 5th time that UCL and Imperial have met on the handball court on a competitive level, but not even the infamous 9:7\nvictory for IC in 2010 was as closely contested\nas last weekend\u2019s game. In fact, the tension was\nso obvious, that even our Spanish line-player,\nIgnacio Vasquez-Garcia, managed to be on\ntime for a game for the first time this season.\nIn an act of provocation, the UCL-based girls\nplaying for the two rivals\u2019 joint women\u2019s team\ncame to support their university\u2019s players, despite that fact that they train with Imperial, but\nsoon changed their \u2018loyalties\u2019 in favour of the\nmore attractive side.\nThe game was off to a good start for Imperial\nas Lucas Carstens, inspired by the fact that his\nDanish countrymen had reached the Handball\nWorld Cup final the day before, found the back\nof the net with a rocket of a shot in the first\nminute. However, UCL appeared not to be intimidated and even managed to take the lead in\nthe early stages of the game.\nThe Eagles\u2019 solid 5-1 defence, with an ever-so-agile Roberto Galli fighting for every ball,\nkept the visitors from South Ken in the game.\nUntypically, though, it was the attacking department that appeared to have trouble getting\ninto the game. \u2018Incroyable\u2019 was Thibault Hervier\u2019s response when asked to comment about\nthe missed chances in front of the opponent\u2019s\ngoal, which was, in all fairness, guarded by a\nreal goalkeeper this time.\nWhen the referee blew the half time whistle\n(the only right call that baboon made all day)\nthe Imperial Eagles were trailing by 3 goals.\nThe interval gave every member of the team\ntime to reflect on an intense 30 minutes and\noffered an opportunity to have some rather\nbruised digits taped for Hugh Ronzani, who\nwas brave enough to play on.\nTobias Gierk displayed impressive relentlessness in attack and was keen to induce\nsome rhythm into the game by coordinating\nIC\u2019s clever, yet largely unsuccessful schemes,\nwhich did prove difficult in a heated match like\nthis. As a matter of fact, the aforementioned\nprimate of a referee made things worse by\ndemonstrating a unique lack of vision combined with spectacularly poor understanding\nof the game\u2019s rules. His decisions intensely\ninfuriated our president and right-back Kolja\nOrtmann, who let off some steam on the court\nby scoring an impressive goal with an underarm shot that almost saw the UCL keeper jump\nout of the way.\nWith Juan Avila-Anton making his debut\nfor the Imperial Eagles and David M\u00fcller-Wiesner brining some fresh legs onto the court,\nthe team made sure to stay within 4 goals of\ntheir rivals, and eventually go ahead towards\nthe end of the game. No one expected the hosts\nto surrender easily though \u2013 and they surely\ndidn\u2019t! UCL gathered all the energy they had\nleft and tirelessly fired shot after shot at Stefan\nBauer\u2019s goal. However, IC\u2019s number one and\nmost capped player was equal to almost everything that came his way on this day and, once\nagain, played a crucial role in a fixture against\nthis site.\nWith merely 90 seconds to go, Imperial was\n3 goals ahead and could smell the sweet scent\nof victory when Mike Capper, who had significantly increased his season-scoring-tally in the\nfirst half of the game, found himself in a promising shooting position. After his potentially\ndecisive shot came off the post the team lost\nfocus on 2 occasions, which handed their opponent a chance to even draw the game in the last\nmoments. Fortunately, an ill-timed pass handed\npossession over to the guests again, who then\nmade no mistake and secured those valuable 2\nleague points.\nPlayer 14 has had a strong season, he\u2019s really bounced back from those sex scandals\nStefan Bauer\nHandball\nIC 1st 22 - 21 UCL 1st\n5 points for a win | 2 points for a draw | -4 points for a loss\nTeam P W D L F A Diff Index\n1 Fencing M1 8 8 0 0 960 757 203 5.00\n2 Basketball M1 8 8 0 0 607 467 140 5.00\n3 Fencing W1 7 7 0 0 940 497 443 5.00\n4 Table Tennis M2 6 6 0 0 94 8 86 5.00\n5 Water Polo W1 5 4 1 0 72 12 60 4.40\n6 Volleyball M1 10 9 0 1 19 4 15 4.10\n7 Volleyball W1 10 9 0 1 18 4 14 4.10\n8 Tennis M1 10 8 1 1 76 44 32 3.80\n9 Lacrosse W1 7 6 0 1 103 27 76 3.71\n10 Table Tennis M1 6 5 0 1 70 32 38 3.50\n11 ICSM Netball W1 10 8 0 2 399 269 130 3.20\n12 Squash W1 10 8 0 2 31 8 23 3.20\n13 Basketball W1 5 4 0 1 229 178 51 3.20\n14 Table Tennis W1 5 4 0 1 20 5 15 3.20\n15 Hockey W1 9 7 0 2 53 16 37 3.00\n16 Lacrosse M1 8 6 0 2 117 74 43 2.75\n17 Netball W1 11 8 0 3 457 310 147 2.55\n18 Rugby M1 10 7 0 3 217 143 74 2.30\n19 ICSM Hockey W1 7 4 1 2 25 15 10 2.00\n20 ICSM Football M1 7 4 1 2 23 14 9 2.00\n21 Hockey M1 7 4 1 2 22 17 5 2.00\n22 ICSM Hockey M3 6 4 0 2 11 19 -8 2.00\n23 ICSM Rugby M3 8 5 0 3 168 209 -41 1.63\n24 Badminton M1 10 4 3 3 44 36 8 1.40\n25 Tennis W1 5 3 0 2 30 30 0 1.40\n26 Hockey M2 9 4 2 3 16 23 -7 1.33\n27 Netball W3 7 4 0 3 231 168 63 1.14\n28 Hockey M3 7 2 3 2 6 5 1 1.14\n29 Football M1 10 5 1 4 27 17 10 1.10\n30 Badminton W1 10 5 1 4 34 46 -12 1.10\n31 Fencing M2 9 5 0 4 1017 994 23 1.00\n32 Netball W2 8 4 0 4 295 333 -38 0.50\n33 ICSM Netball W4 6 3 0 3 152 149 3 0.50\n34 ICSM Badminton W1 7 2 2 3 29 33 -4 0.29\n35 ICSM Badminton M1 8 3 1 4 24 40 -16 0.13\n36 ICSM Netball W2 9 4 0 5 282 298 -16 0.00\n37 Fencing W2 9 4 0 5 1026 1051 -25 0.00\n38 ICSM Hockey M1 7 3 0 4 13 14 -1 -0.14\n39 ICSM Hockey M2 8 2 2 4 12 24 -12 -0.25\n40 ICSM Football M2 5 2 0 3 14 16 -2 -0.40\n41 Football W1 5 2 0 3 11 15 -4 -0.40\n42 Badminton M2 8 3 0 5 33 31 2 -0.63\n43 Football M2 9 4 0 7 12 27 -15 -0.89\n44 Ice Hockey Mx2 2 0 1 1 2 7 -5 -1.00\n45 Water Polo M1 2 0 1 1 13 18 -5 -1.00\n46 ICSM Hockey W3 3 1 0 2 3 13 -10 -1.00\n47 Ice Hockey Mx1 6 2 0 4 24 41 -17 -1.00\n48 ICSM Rugby M1 9 2 1 6 144 279 -135 -1.33\n49 Squash M3 7 2 0 5 10 23 -13 -1.43\n50 Fencing M3 7 2 0 5 755 843 -88 -1.43\n51 ICSM Rugby M2 10 2 1 7 172 344 -172 -1.60\n52 Squash M4 4 1 0 3 5 7 -2 -1.75\n53 ICSM Hockey W2 8 2 0 6 20 39 -19 -1.75\n54 Hockey W2 8 2 0 6 10 32 -22 -1.75\n55 Rugby M3 8 2 0 6 66 281 -215 -1.75\n56 ICSM Badminton M2 5 1 0 4 14 26 -12 -2.20\n57 Rugby W1 6 1 0 5 76 195 -119 -2.50\n58 Rugby M2 12 2 0 10 168 320 -152 -2.50\n59 Football M3 7 1 0 6 13 24 -11 -2.71\n60 Hockey M4 7 1 0 6 8 19 -11 -2.71\n61 Rugby M4 7 1 0 6 49 295 -246 -2.71\n62 Tennis M2 6 0 1 5 14 57 -43 -3.00\n63 Squash M2 10 1 0 9 11 39 -28 -3.10\n64 Squash M1 6 0 0 6 4 26 -22 -4.00\n65 ICSM Netball W3 7 0 0 7 134 257 -123 -4.00\nRugby: First team earn hard fought\nvictory in dying seconds of the game\nDavid Wilson\nRugby\nImperial 1s 24-21 Kent University 1s\nCaptain Charlie Esberger barged over for a try\nin the penultimate play of the match to rescue a\nresult for Imperial who appeared to be heading\nfor a second loss in a row after letting a two try\nlead slip.\nImperial were looking to bounce back last\nweeks shock defeat to Chichester and started\nthe match brightly with the forwards providing good ball for the backs to attack out wide.\nWhilst man of the match, Louie Barnett prevented certain Kent try with a last man tackle.\nDiscipline still remains a problem amongst the\nteam, with penalties allowing Kent to gain territory and cancelling out Imperial\u2019s hard work\nin attack. Imperial went ahead with a try from\nThomas Chavas who protected the ball at the\ntail of a driving maul off a lineout.. Despite offering threat, Imperial could not build on their\nlead and lax defending allowed Kent to level\njust before the break.\nImperial took the game to their visitors after\nhalf time and went ahead with tries from Simon\nFenton and a second from Chavas, following\ngood carries from Ed Labinski, Jamie Aldridge\nand Sean Baker. Kent old boy, Ben Adubi,\ncombined well with his partner at centre, Joe\nHarris, and the back three of Barnett, Nathan\nFitzpatrick, Jack Judd and his replacement Jack\nNewton ran good strong lines whilst the half\nbacks of James Hayward and Olly Cox produced a solid platform to work off. Substitute\nveteran prop, Callum O\u2019Rourke, added further\nstrength in the scrum and the loose as the game\nwore on.\nComplacency seeped into Imperial\u2019s game\nallowing Kent back in but the team showed its\ndetermination and grit to come back and snatch\na victory from the jaws of defeat.\n46\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX 3\n\u00a3940 million cut to funding\nbehalf of the government, has allocated\n\u00a36,507m for the 2011-2012 academic\nyear, covering teaching, research and\nbuilding among other areas. The teaching budget is to be reduced by \u00a3180m\nto \u00a34.3bn and the research grant by\n\u00a317.4m to \u00a31.6bn. \u00a3223m has been allocated to capital projects, such as new\nbuildings, a 58% reduction from the\nprevious year. The cuts come as the\ngovernment makes savings across all\ndepartments, a strategy aimed at reducing the UK\u2019s large budget deficit.\nWhilst the Universities Minister, David Willetts, has called for the teaching\nbudget to be protected as far as possible,\nhe acknowledged, \u201chigher education,\nlike other areas of public spending, has\nhad to take its share of savings.\u201d\nImperial will not learn of its exact\nfunding until next month when grants\nto individual institutions are decided.\nHowever, Sir Alan Langlands, Chief\nExecutive of Hefce, said that the Board\n\u201cwelcomed the decision of the government to ring fence and maintain in cash\nterms the overall funding provided by\nthe Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) for science and\nresearch\u201d. Therefore, it is likely that Imperial, being primarily a science insti-tution, will not experience funding cuts\nas drastic as other humanities-focused\nuniversities.\nThe Hefce Board have indicated that\nthe quality of research will be a key determinant in the allocation of research\nfunding to a university: \u201cFunding is\nbeing allocated more selectively by pri-oritising internationally excellent and\nworld leading research.\u201d\n\u00a3150m for the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), enabling universities and businesses to work more\nclosely together, is also being maintained in cash terms. Langlands also\nsaid that this HEIF would be allocated\namong the \u201cmost effective performers\u201d.\nThe Hefce has also detailed reductions in funding for the current academic year 2010-11, the first time such\nchanges have been implemented part\nway through. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and\nFriday 11 february 2011\nFunding Council reveals almost \u00a31 billion cut to university budgets in 2011/12\nUniversities Minister David Willetts has called on universities to\nadapt to the new environment of\nhigher education funding\nSkills grant announcement for 2011-12\nrelates to the financial year (1 April to\n31 March), therefore affecting funding\nfor the final four months of the 2010-11\nacademic year. The funding cuts will be\nimplemented through Hefce\u2019s monthly\ngrant payments to institutions between\nApril and July 2011.\nLanglands said, \u201cwe are attempting as\nfar as possible to support a smooth transition for all institutions to the new student finance and funding arrangements\nwhich will take place in the academic\nyear 2012-13. Universities have anticipated the challenges ahead and many\nhave already taken difficult decisions to\nreduce their costs.\u201d\nDavid Willetts supported the funding\nannouncements and called on universities to adapt to what he called \u201cthe\ndifferent environment\u201d that they now\nfind themselves in: \u201cIt is essential that\nuniversities move quickly to prepare for\nthe different environment in which they\nwill operate in future years, striving to\nmeet the aspirations of students for high\nquality teaching. As well as benefiting\nfrom investment in student support, the\nhigher education sector will continue to\nbenefit from sustained ring-fenced investment in science and research.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Paul Marshall, Director\nof the 1994 Group which represents\nsmall, research-intensive universities,\nwarned that universities were facing\na tough future: \u201cthe sweeping funding\ncuts show that universities will need\nto work harder than ever to make their\ncontribution\u201d.\nGareth Thomas, Labour\u2019s shadow\nUniversities Minister said, \u201cthe decision\nto cut so much from university teaching\nbudgets, the massive cut to capital funding and then to load the cost on to the\nnext generation of students by trebling\ntuition fees is unfair, unnecessary and\nunsustainable\u201d.\nMeanwhile, aside from the funding\ncuts, the Hefce has set up a \u00a312.5m\nfund to support the development of\ncloud computing on hosted systems by\nuniversities. They have used part of the\nUniversity Modernisation Fund to make\n\u00a310m available for developing a shared\nIT infrastructure and \u00a32.5m for setting\nup shared services for administration.\nThe programme is aimed at improving\nefficiency in higher education.\nDavid Sweeney, Hefce\u2019s director of\nresearch, innovation and skills, said,\n\u201cAt a time of pressure on university re-sources, it is critical that technology is\nused in a collaborative and cost-effec-tive way, to deliver services that will\nbenefit the sector. Cloud computing has\nthe potential to do this in ways which\nwill serve the academic community\nleading to improvements in research,\nteaching and administration.\u201d\nA group of five PhD students have expressed complaints after they encountered issues with funding from the Imperial College Business School. The\nstudents, ranging from second to third\nyears on the Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) scholarship scheme complained that they were expected to perform teaching as part of their contract\nwhile first years have no such condition\nin the terms, therefore allowing them to\nearn more money for doing so.\nThe GTA scheme, which offers a bur-sary of \u00a316,000 and has an expectation\nof six hours of teaching per week, had no\nofficial contract until last year. Students\nwere considering whether the hours they\nworked exceeded the expectation and\nfelt they were working far more than\nsix hours per week performing other\nteaching duties. The students therefore\napproached the department which was\nlater convinced to draw up contracts for\nthe PhD GTAs.\nThe contracts included terms starting October 2010 which detailed the\n\u00a316,000 bursary with the expected six\nhours teaching time plus nine hours non-contact time such as marking. The issue\narose after the students signed the contract and later realised the one drawn up\nfor first years starting in October 2010\nwas for a bursary of the same amount\nbut with no expectation of teaching\ntime. This meant that while those who\u2019d\nsigned the contract for second and third\nyears were expected to teach as part of\nthe terms, first years were able to earn\nextra money by putting in hours which\nwere not expected of them.\nThe Graduate Teaching Assistant\nscheme offered by the Imperial College\nBusiness School involves postgraduate\nstudents undergoing employment on a\nAlex Karapetian temporary contract in order to assume\nteaching related responsibilities. The\nscheme is a valuable career step for an\naspiring academic and responsibilities\nare split up into contact hours which involve teaching, assisting in tutorials, etc\nand non-contact hours such as marking\ncoursework or setting questions.\nProfessor David Begg, Principal of\nthe Business School, has described the\nBusiness School\u2019s courses as \u201ctaking the\nbest strategies from around the world\u2019\u2019\nand \u201ccombining them with ground\nbreaking research [\u2026] to equip our students with the knowledge and the confidence they need to be key players in\nthe new global economy\u201d. Formerly the\nTanaka Business School, it offers management modules in accordance towards\nsome degrees taken by Imperial College\nstudents and separate finance, risk management and research courses for post-graduates.\nThe mismatch in the terms outlined\nin the new contracts surprised the affected students with what appeared to\nbe unfairness considering both contracts\nhad been drafted and signed at the same\ntime, with different sets of conditions\nfor students on the same scholarship\nin the same department. A number of\npostgraduate funding issues have arisen\nover the current academic year, notably\nthe confusion surrounding student funding in the Department of Electrical and\nElectronic Engineering, where payment\nwas not given to students who complete\nadditional duties alongside their work.\nThe Department of Aeronautics were\nalso criticised for cutting eleven PhD\nstudents\u2019 monthly bursary payments\nwithout warning. The Business School\ndeclined to comment on the issue. It is\nunderstood that the Union are actively\nencouraging PhD students from all departments to double check their funding.\n\u00a3190m additional cut\nthis academic year\nSophia David\nPhD funding woes hit Business School\nAs more issues with PhD funding arise, Union asks students to check their accounts\nImperial College London\n...Continued from Front Page\nMmm, jaunty angle... *drools\n\n"

The invasion of the internet has certainly chipped away at\nprint media\u2019s appeal, and perhaps one\ncould argue that music hacks have\nbeen one of the worst hit. However\nthe NME\u2019s portfolio has expanded,\nand since 1999 they have been giving\nout some gongs to some bands for being the best, the worst and the most\nvillainous. Awards shows may also be\nlooked upon with a spoonful of cyni-cism; as purely masseurs for overin-flated rockstar egos. Don\u2019t hold that\nnotion against the celebratory gigs\nthat are happening right here in the\ncapital throughout February, in the\nbuild up to the big event on the 23rd.\nIt all kicked off with Metronomy at\nHeaven, who have tentatively started\nrearing their heads in the run up to the\nrelease of what could potentially be\none of the albums of the year. The next\nday saw performance by punk legends\nGang of Four and also bright indie upstarts Los Campesinos.\nBut to the future! Aside from gigs by\nNew Musical Express\nWhite Lies, Miles Kane, The Bee\u2019s,\nNoah and the Whale, Yuck, Warpaint, and someone who used to be in the\nLibertines, there are some other gigs to\nyou should know about:\nIsobel Cambel\u2019s ongoing project\nwith Mark Lanegan (a man with a voice\nso gravelly he could grit roads), returns\nback to the UK once more with their\nshow at Shepherds Bush on the 15th.\nExpect twee americana that is often\ncompared to Nancy Sinatra and Lee\nHazlewood. While Isobel and Marks\nalliance may seem unlikely, or even un-holy, their folk musings are well worth\na listen.\nIf Sonic Youth had a bastard child\nwith Dinosaur Junior, then it might\nwell have been Yuck. A band that loves\na bit of flange (\u2026in an effect pedal con-text, you filthy people) and clipping the\nshit out of their distortion boxes they\nare causing some teenage riots at Bush\nHall on the 18th. They will be joined by\nCults, a band where you can search for\nmelody under a cascade of noise\nIt was always going to be tough reviewing a gig for the band that is headlining our own music night (19.02 @Metric,\nSaturday 19th February). I am pleased to\nVetoes\nEP Launch @ The Social\n7th February, 2011\nGreg Power\nsay that any concerns I might have had\nabout reviewing Vetoes\u2019 performance\nwere thwarted as soon as the band hit the\nstage of The Social, among a room full of\nfriends, family and fans for the launch of\ntheir debut EP Ritalin/Ritalout.\nGiving out the EP for free was a great\ntouch for one, but more importantly their\nmusic speaks lengths about the musical\ntalent and far-reaching ambitions of the\nband. As much as I enjoy the post-punk\nguitars and sing-along choruses of EP\ntracks such as \u201cMelting Clocks\u201d, it is\ntheir new material that really gets me ex-cited. Far more adventurous in nature and\nskirting into experimental, unclassifiable\ngenre-bending territory, the tracks played\nat The Social for the first time ever revealed the expansiveness of Vetoes\u2019technical skills, as well as their love for alternating uplifting melodies with all-out\ncock-rock spazz attacks. These guys are\non to something very special indeed and\ntheir fan-base will without a doubt keep\ngrowing fast if they keep writing tunes\nlike these. Catch them at 19.02, before\nthey hit the big time!\nWe might have mentioned our favorite musical alumni before, and we wont\nhesitate to mention him again. Caribou\nreturns to London, no doubt remind us\nwhy his album \u2018Swim\u2019 was one of the\nfinest releases of 2010. He plays on the\n22nd, a fine way to close , that is unless you\u2019d rather go for a bit more post\nhardcore in which case its is Les Savy\nFav you should be seeing at Heaven.\nChristopher Walmsley\nYucking awesome!\nFriday 11 february 2011\n\n"

Perhaps such uninhibited students have more active sexual lives than\ntheir unsurveyed colleagues. While we\ntried to promote the survey widely, the\nsomewhat skewed number of 3rd and 4th\nyear respondents indicates that a significant number are part of the wider social\nnetwork of Felix Editors. Additionally, our\nparticipation was limited to 562 students,\nwith individual departments providing anything from 11 to 104 responses. Those\nwith smaller sample sizes are self-evi-dently less generally representative.\nAs a final disclaimer, every attempt was\nmade to weed out nonsensical responses.\n15% are still virgins. Around 50% of respondents admitted to watching porn at least once a week and 26\nadventurous students identified as straight but admitted that they had slept with a member of the same\nsex.\n10% said that they have engaged in a threesome\nand the vast majority rejected the idea that studying\nat Imperial had restricted their sex life. However, one\npoor student commented: \u201cBoys NEVER hit on me\nhere! Literally, the better I look, the more they run\naway. I get the most attention when I look a bit rub-bish. They need to MAN-UP!\u201d\nThe results are, admittedly, a mixed bag. While the\ndata is not wholly unrepresentative, it is not strong\nenough to indicate anything other than certain trends.\nThey also sadly don\u2019t offer any quick fixes for stagnating sex lives.

The Materials Department are well in front with 73% of their students\nmasturbating daily or a few times a week (regularly).\nHowever, due to the low number of respondents there,\nthe potential for error is quite high. Mech Eng, by con-trast, is a much more stable sample. 70% of their students masturbate regularly, compared with only 36%\nin the Life Sciences Department \u2013 perhaps due to the\ngreater percentage of female students. The trend supports the idea that women masturbate less, as departments with more females lie low in the spectrum.\nIncredible though it may seem, the Mathematicians\nplace third in our survey for frequency of sexual ac-tivity. In fact, their Department has the highest percentage of students who claim to have sex daily. By\ncontrast, almost 50% of students in Aero and EEE\nare either virgins or engage in sexual activity only\na few times a year.

The\nspeakers included Tony Millns (English\nUK), Aaron Porter (National Union of\nStudents), Dominic Scott (Universities\nand Colleges Information Systems Association), Susan Hindley (Study UK),\nNicola Dandridge (Universities UK) and\nProfessor Edward Acton (University of\nEast Anglia).\nMajor education sector stakeholders\nhighly object to new visa proposals that\ninclude raising the minimum level of\nEnglish proficiency required for entry,\nlimiting opportunities for work experience and part time work for students\nand total abolishment of Post-Study\nWork Route. Those changes could have\n\u201ccatastrophic effects on universities\u201d\nthat could potentially \u201c\u2026make home\nfees matter slightly fade from the central\nstage\u2026\u201d\nInternational education is a key\ngrowth sector of the British economy,\ncontributing almost 5 billion pounds a\nyear. International students\u2019 fees sub-sidise home students allowing courses\nand sometimes whole departments to be\nrun. At a time when the whole country\nis facing financial difficulties and cuts\nare being made to the state funding of\nuniversities, international students are\nabsolutely vital to the survival of most\neducational institutions. Many universities are also highly dependent upon\ninternational researches and teachers to\nteach STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects. The\nimplementation of these new regulations\nwill therefore lead to the contraction of\nthe whole sector. Taking into account reduction in cultural diversity UK universities were always proud of, that would\ndefinitely have a major impact on home\nstudents\u2019 experiences as well.\nThe proposal is to raise the minimum\nlevel of English required for entry into\nthe UK to B2 on the common European\nframework of reference which is equivalent to a high grade A-level. This is a\nreal threat to pre-university education,\nwhich provides international students\nwith an opportunity to improve their\nlanguage and independent learning\nskills together with a subject top-up\nwhich at the end enables them to study\nin UK universities. Most of the students\nfollowing this route do not have the\nnecessary English level required for entry according to the new proposals, and\ntherefore they will not be allowed into\nthe country (for example, up to 80% of\nFoundation students, which make up to\n50% of the total international students\nrecruited by universities, do not have\nthe required English level). Other proposals include limitations to students\u2019\nrights to work experience and part time\njobs (increase allowed study to work\nratio from 50:50 to 66:33). Dependants\nof those international students, e.g.\nwife/husband, will not be allowed to\nwork at all. This extends even to voluntary work.\nHowever, the change most international students feel extremely frustrated about is the abolishment of Post\nStudy Work visa. Currently students\nare allowed to stay in the UK for two\nyears after they have finished their degree to get work experience essential\nto prove the creditability of their de-grees. Now international students will\nno longer have this opportunity and\nwill be forced to leave the country as\nsoon as they finish their course. With\nno work experience after graduation it\nwould be extremely difficult to find a\njob elsewhere, especially in the current\neconomic crisis.\nAll of these changes not only make\ninternational students extremely unsure\nof their own future but together with\nnumerous tightening of visa regimes\nover the past two years, makes them\nfeel very unwelcome in the UK. British\nuniversities were known for their excellence for decades, and the majority of\ninternational students (93%) were completely satisfied with their stay in the\nUK. However international students are\nno longer getting the world class experience they were expecting when they\ninvested thousands of pounds into the\nBritish economy. Many undergraduate\nstudents who were planning to continue\ntheir studies in the UK with a Masters or\na PhD now feel they need to search for\na more stable and trustworthy environment in other countries.\nIndeed, this issue is not just about\nmoney. It is about respect, trust, reputation and business links around the\nworld that once destroyed will be extremely difficult to restore. The current\nproposals will not only cause a substantial loss of income, it will seriously\nthreaten the image of UK as \u201copened\nfor business\u201d.\nThe changes proposed by the government are indeed the most radical\nin decades, if not generations, and are\nprobably not that thought through. The\nMigration Advisory Committee (MAC)\nundertook a proper weighting of economical pros and cons of economical\nmigration but there was no equivalent\nassessment of temporary student mi-gration. The main goal set by MAC\nis to reduce net migration to \u201ctens of\nthousands\u201d during this parliament. In\nassessing the scale and make-up of\ncurrent net migration MAC was relaying on International Passenger Survey\n(IPS), however even MAC does not\nconsider those figures to be completely\naccurate. According to IPS, Student\nRoute contributes 60% to the total net\nmigration with Work and Family routes\neach contributing 20%. MAC then decided that the reduction to be borne by\neach of those routes should be in proportion to its contribution to net migration recorded by IPS \u2013 which means a\n60% reduction of thoroughly legitimate\nstudents coming to the UK. Those re-ductions, however, cannot solve the\nmigration problem the government is\ntrying to tackle because international\nDeterring Internationals\nAll of these changes\nmake international\nstudents feel\nextremely unsure of\ntheir future and very\nunwelcome in the\nUnited Kingdom\n\u201c\nstudents are not economical migrants\nbut merely a transient population, with\napproximately equal number of students coming and leaving each year.\nTherefore student migration should be\ndecoupled from the total economical\nmigration and not addressed in attempts\nto reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK.\nIt looks like the government simply\nVisa restrictions could deter international students, to the detriment of the UK\u2019s higher education system\nant.photos/flickr\ndoes not understand the consequences\nof these changes to student visas. The 8\nweek consultation period ended January\n31st and received more than 30,000 re-sponses. The results of the consultation\nwill be announced in the coming weeks\nand there is nothing left to do now but\nhope that the government will moderate\nthe proposal and not let the catastrophe\nstrike the British education system.\n\n"
