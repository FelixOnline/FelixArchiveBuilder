    "content": "Page 2 FELIX February 25, 1971\nLate Letters\nA day in the life Dear Diary,\nToday I got up at 8.30\na.m.I ate my breakfast and\ncaught the bus to college.\nDuring the journey I read an\nElectronics text book.\nI arrived at college at 9.20\nand since I had ten minutes\nto spare before the lecture\nstarted, I didn't waste them\nbut continued reading my\ntext book. When the lecture\nstarted I took notes on all\nthat the lecturer said. It was\nvery interesting. At the end\nhe gave out a new problem\nsheet.\nAt 10.30 we had no lecture\nso I went into the study\nroom. Since I was up to\ndate with all my other problems I started on the new\nsheet. I managed to do most\nof them but found difficulty\nwith one problem.\nAfter another interesting\nlecture I had a quick snack\nand then returned to the\nstudy room to read some\nmore of my text book. The\nafternoon was spent in the\nlaboratory where I completed\na very important experiment\non the Transistor Amplifier.\nAt 5.30 p.m. I came back\nto my digs and, after tea, I completed all my problems\nfrom today and copied up my\nlab. Afterwards I read my\ntext books in preparation for\ntomorrow's lectures. I am\njust about to go to bed at\n10.30 p.m. But, dear diary, today I met a strange sort of student.\nHe was telling me that he\nhad only done the first problem sheet and he was five labs\nbehind in copying up. His\nreason was that he didn't have time; he was too busy\nwith other things! \"But why\ndid he come here?\" I won-de red.I can't understand\nanyone who doesn't want to\ndo college work all the time,\nI don't think I ought to mix\nwith students like this. I can't understand anyone who\nisn't like me.\nCooke \u2014 fingers burnt TO HELL WITH EXAMS!\nDear Sir,\nRarely, even in a student\nnewspaper, can an article\nhave combined so ill informed a mixture of unproven\nfacts, absurd opinions and\nasinine conclusions as your\nMr. Cooke, and his article on\n'Strikes and the militant'\n(11th February).\nMr. Cooke links the\nbombings of the Angry Brigade, and militant shop\nstewards (these people, as he\nputs it, with aristocratic\ngrace). One can only hope\nthat he realizes the implications of this. Have the communist militants, the trotsky-ite militants, the anarchist\nmilitants, and the ordinary\neconomic militants buried the\nideological hatchet at last? Is\n*the angry brigade the thin\nend of the revolutionary con-flag ration? Alas, it seems\nmore likely that Mr. Cooke\nhas simply extrapolated from\nreality into fantasy. Anyone\nwho reads the papers can see\nthat shop stewards are mili-tant, as is the angry brigade;\nthe logical conclusion is\nobvious.\nFreedom, Mr. Cooke im-plies, is linked with capital-ism, any other system, he\nwarns, will only bring chaos.\n(I trust that Mr. Cooke is reviewing the virtues of capitalism in the light of the RollsRoyce affair). Quite why Mr.\nCooke links the freedom of\nthe individual so in d is so lu bly with capitalism I am at a loss\nto understand, unless he has\nin mind the freedom to become a millionaire\u2014or to\nhelp someone else become\none. None of the commonly\naccepted basic freedoms seem\nto me to be linked with any\neconomic system, though\nthey may be obstructed by a But what ways are there out of the rigid exam system?\nWe can make teaching much more work and sMU oriented,\nless tied to syllabuses, and more 'liberal.' And it is necessary\nto be aware of a great danger here. The danger is that becoming more 'liberal' is seen to mean having more diverse\nstudies, and I think this is quite mistaken. There is enormous\nvalue in special is ation: it gives the specialist authority and\nconfidence. It gives him the experience of doing things in\nfields in which he can exercise initiative, and education for\nlife is equipping people to use their initiative, to feel confident with some justification, to feel responsible, to feel that\nthey understand their judgements and are not passing the\nreal responsibility elsewhere. The mere fact of being a specialist gives a person something that a well-rounded, liberal\nminded, balanced person who is not a specialist can never\nhave. The experience of operating specialist skills is exhilarating and is, incidentally, a path to experiences which some\npeople seek through drugs (and do not ever grasp because\nthe skills never become built into their conscious and controlled selves).\nExams are a terrible imposition on those who do not\nexpect to be successful. It is no use talking about lazy\nstudents. People do not fail through laziness but through\nlack of incentive. One of the great justifications for exams\nis that they provide incentive, and if they fail to do this\nin any individual case, that person becomes a victim of a system which goes on using a method even after it is clearly\nseen to be failing. Depressed students who can't work should\nnot be persecuted, as they undoubtedly are nowadays, merely\nbecause someone else thinks that the exam ought to provide\nan incentive for them, and that its the student's fault if it\ndoesn't. Of course exams are not an incentive at all really; it\nis the certificate, prize, or degree which is in prospect that is\nthe incentive, and any other system which awarded them\nwould be just as good. An exam is quite useless \u2014 nobody\never wants to use the \"work\" done in the exam hal i, or even\nsee it again if they can avoid it, so why should it be an\nincentive to a sensible person? What teaching should be\nbased on is the wonderful experience of acquiring skills and\nusing them: the only benefit from education is from the\nskills, including the control and understanding of all aspects\nof one's self, that one has at the end. Teaching should be\ndesigned to give every student the opportunity to feel these\nskills growing inside him, and because what students can do\nvaries enormously from one to another it is quite silly to\ntry to force them into the same mould and measure them all\nby the same test.\nI have come to dislike exams rather strongly because they\nwreck the relationships I try to establish in teaching: with\nclever students they are an unnecessary bore in every sense,\nwith weak students they are quite pernicious because they\nimpose on the teacher and student the task of grooming him\nfor a kind of athletic performance he is no good at and\nnot helping him to grow into the best person he can be. All\nthe none sense about discipline that we hear in connection\nwith exams arises because we are trying to do silly things\nwith the wrong people, and so of course we have to introduce\nsome form of artificial compulsion.\nStudents who argue the case against exams will carry most\nweight if they show that they positively want to get on with\nsome other aspect of the learning business and that exams\nget in the way of this. It is less credible if the student complains he is being persecuted by the system (even though it is\ntrue), and that side of the argument should be left to the\nteachers, who feel it strongly and are more likely to be\nbelieved. The students, will, I hope respond with enthusiasm\nto opportunities to get on with real work. If a teacher offers\nan alternative to an exam and meets only the sort of bloody-mindedness that I feel is actually justified in the case of\nexams everyone will be the loser, and we shall end up with a more rigid system with the reactionaries of society saying\nwith glee \"I told you so!\"\nWe must not forget that exams are actually useful to many\npeople and so we continue to have them. But they are useful\nbecause people have planned everything on the assumption\nthat we must have them, just as they plan their lives on the\nbasis of many other quite arbitrary aspects of our lives such\nas the tax laws, inheritance laws, marriage laws, and so on.\nSome laws are more sacred than others of course, but\nexams aren't even laws, they are convenient regulations\nwhose form has evolved in a special historical context and\nthey are becoming intolerable.\nR.S. Scorer\nsystem. It appears that Mr.\nCooke takes the view that a terrible state of affairs in the\nso-called socialist countries\njustifies a different but,\nequally terrible state of\naffairs in this country, a very\ncurious argument.\nNothing like as curious,\nhowever as Mr. Cooke's parting shot. He informs us\nthat if all the Capital in the\ncountry (which he takes to\nbe \u00a3300 million, heaven\nknows why) were distributed\namongst the people, then\nwithin 6 months it would all\nbe concentrated in capitalist\nhands once more. We are\nnot informed why this would\nhappen, but as an economic\nprinciple, it is startling in its\nelegance. Perhaps that is its\nappeal to Mr. Cooke who\nobviously prefers imaginative\nel g ance to realistic analysis.\nYours faithfully,\nH.D. Anderson.\nSELLING OF A PRESIDENT\nPost Seconders Nom.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX February 25, 1971\nREVIEW RECORDS CHARLIE HOLME The new LP by Judy Collins, \"Whales and Nightingales\" (Elektra) has just\nbeen released in this country\nafter several weeks of availability on the import mar-ket. Some of the 13 tracks\nare reminiscent of her earlier\nrecord \"Wildflowers\", in\nparticular the two Jacques\nBrel songs and Judy's own\ncontribution \"Nightingale\",\na simple but haunting\nmelody in the same vein as\nearlier tracks such as \"Since\nyou Asked\", also arranged\nby Joshua Rifkin. Tributes\nto Dylan (Time Passes\nSlowly) and Baez (Song for\nDavid) are included, but the\nmost unusual tracks are\nthose without instrumental\naccompaniment. \"Amazing\nGrace\" is well known, and\nthere is also \"Farewell to\nTarwathie\" with its background choir of humpback\nwhales! A good idea brilliantly carried out. Perhaps\nthe best track is Dominic\nBehan's \"Patriot Game\"\nframed by the lonely sound\nof a squeeze-box. The song,\nwhich is rather topical at the\nmoment, is set to the tune\nwhich Bob Dylan borrowed\nfor \"With God on our Side\".\nAlso of note is \"Nightingale\nII\", an orchestral variation\nby Joshua Rifkin on the\nbasic tune of \"Nightingale\nI\". Not completely unlike the\nmusic of Judy Collins is\nthat of Pentangle, Whose LP\n\"Cruel Sister\" (Transatlan-tic) was issued a couple of\nmonths ago. On this record\nthe group have devoted\nthemselves entirely to the\ninterpretation of traditional\nEnglish music. One side is\nwholly devoted to a17 minute version of the ballad\n\"Jack Orion\" which also appeared a few year ago as the\ntitle track of a Bert Jansch\nLP. Four of the 17 minutes\nare occupied by a Terry\nCox du lc it one solo and a superb electric guitar solo\nfrom John Renbourn. Al though the group apparently\nworked on this song for\neleven months, it appears to\nme to be of indifferent recording quality, particularly\nthe balancing of Jacqui\nMcShee's voice.\nOne of Pentangle's weaker points is excessive improvisation and loose play-ing, but there is one track on\nthis record \u2014 \"Lord Franklin'' \u2014 where this problem\nis nowhere in sight. Renbourn sings in his sad, fractured voice, accompanied by\nhimself on both acoustic and\nelectric guitar, Bert Jansch\nplaying chords on concertina,\nand Jacqui's voice wafting\naround in the background.\nPerfection. Coincidentally,\nthe tune is also one which\nDylan borrowed, for \"Bob\nDylan's Dream\". The LP\nalso includes an unaccompanied item from Jacqui,\nwhich compares very favourably with those of Judy Collins, although without the\ngimmicks.\nThe title track, on which\neveryone joins in the fa-la-la\nrefrain, includes a sitar in\nthe backing \u2014 a weird fusion\nof two national traditions,\nwhich again is not one of\nthe best engineered recordings 1 have heard. Few British producers seem to capture the stereo clarity\nachieved by their American\nequivalents.\nOne exception, however,\nis the work of Peter Vince,\nengineer of the new record\n\"Marvin, Welch and Farrar\"\n(Regal-Zonophone). When\nrequired, he is able to produce crystal clear and\nseparate sounds from each\ninstrument. Listening to this\nrecord reveals different musical styles no doubt attributable to different members of\nthe group. The two tracks\non which Bruce Welch takes\nthe lead vocal, including the\nsingle \"Faithful\", are restrained masterpieces, whilst\nseveral others, obviously influenced by Hank Marvin,\nhark back to the earlier efforts of the Shadows. There\nis, however, an added element of social comment,\nparticularly evident in \"Sil-very Rain\" which concerns\nthe extinction of insects and\nbirds by insecticides, and\n\"Mister Sun\", an anti-war\nsong.\nThe oscillation between\nsmooth lyrical songs and rock\nnumbers, together with the\nguitar work and the occasional sound effects appearing in the far distance, reminds me strongly of Simon\nand Garfunkel's famous\n\"Bridge\" album. John Farrar contributes some excellent string arrangements but\nspoils a couple of the tracks\nby attempting to sing like\nthe Righteous Brothers. Perhaps surprisingly, the record\ncontains no instrumentals.\nMEDITATION The way to the realization of the Higher Self\nH Wednesdays at 7 p.m. Guided sessions with practice and discussion at\nThe Theosophical Society\n50 Gloucester Place, London W1H 3HJ.

Directed by Mike\nNicols \u2014 of \"The Graduate\"\nfame \u2014 the film is an accurate adaptation of the\nbook by Joseph Heller. An\nanti-war epic it is set in the\nMediterranean towards the\nend of the Second World\nWar. Yossarian (played by\nAlan Arkin) is a captain in\na bomber squadron endeavour ing to get himself relieved from operations. To\ndo this he must prove himself crazy but there is a catch. How can he be crazy\nif he is sane enough to want\nto be grounded? Catch 22.\nThe film is an incredible\nsequence of flashbacks and\nhallucinatory visions, making the prior reading of the\nbook almost a necessity.\nThe fantasies are centred\naround Yossarian's horrific\nexperience with a dying\nyoung English pilot, Snowden, returning from a bombing mission. And here lies\nthe film's power as an antiwar film: just when we think\nwe understand the horror of\nSnowden's death, Nicols\nshocks us with a bloody\nmoment strong enough to\nshake anybody complacent\nabout war. Because \"Catch\n22\" does not show any actual\nscenes of war it does not\nfall into the trap, common\nto many anti-war films, of\naccidently picturing war as\nglamorous or exciting.\nSome of the madness of\nthe book is captured by\nJon Voight's portrayal of\nMilo Minderbinder \u2014 a parody of the all-American\nw healer dealer. On cornering\nthe whole Egyptian market in\ncotton Milo finds he is unable\nto set rid of the stuff and\nMIKE YATES after an unsuccessful plan to\nget the troops to eat the cotton covered in chocolate \u2014\nreal cotton candy \u2014 he\nmakes a deal with the Germans to take it off his hands\nin return for letting them\nbomb the American base.\nUnlike many epics, some\nof the expense that went\ninto \"Catch 22\" (15m dol-lars) does appear on film \u2014\nthe all star cast and magnificent sets, in particular\nthose showing the bomber\nsquadron of some 20 to 30\nplanes taking to the air in a most ungainly and eerie\nfashion. One of the overall\nimpressions of the film is the\nbeauty of the photography.\nThe introductory credits are\nshown over a back cloth of a slightly speeded up film of\nthe sun rising over the distant mountains to utter\nsilence.\nA special Wellsoc presentation in the Great Hall last\nTuesday was a talk by Dr.\nR.A. Moog on the subject of\nhis famous synthesis er. The\npurpose of this machine is to\nallow the composer to\ncreate any audio waveform,\nmodify it by means of filters,\nand arrange sounds in sequence if required. Thus he\ncan either reproduce traditional instruments or make\nMOOG\noriginal sounds of his own.\nThe original synthesis er was\ndesigned purely for the man\nworking in a studio making\nmusic on tape, but we were\nalso shown a smaller version\nintended for live perform an ces.\nAfter a historical pre ample, Dr. Moog gave us a thorough\ndemonstration of his brain-child's capabilities, although\nhe could not actually create\nany music, since he had not\nbrought a multi-track re-corder. He did, however,\nconclude his lecture by playing us tapes of various examples of lighter electronic\nmusic.\nThis music is said to be a minority taste, but having\nseen the size of the audience,\nI cannot agree. By the way,\nMoog rhymes with Vogue.\nWRITE/DRAW FOR THE NEW STATESMAN.\nSee current issue for details of Student Journalists\nCompetition. At book stalls, newsagents, Fridays 10p.

This has developed\ninto an internal political hell.\nH is probably due to the\nfact that the suggestion was\nmade by the 'lefty' element\nin Physics, but the situation\nas it now stands seems to\nsuggest that it would have\nreceived the same reception\neven if the well known reactionary Dr. Pain had suggested it. What surprises me\nis that everybody, but every\nbody, keeps harping on the\nsame argument that com-moni sing level eight would\nbe a physical impossibility.\nYes, of course it would be\nif the assumption made was\nthat all the undergraduate\npopulation would be stupid\nenough to pile into the place\nif it were already full. Any\nreasonable student would go\naway after a quick look\naround the place suggested it\nwas too crowded.\nThe suggestion that an\narea on level four be cleared\nfor undergraduate use seems\nquite reasonable at first\nglance.

How\nmany Academic Advisors\ncan boast that they have actually seen (let alone talked\nto) their pupils from the\nsecond year more than twice\nthis year?\nThe only person who has\nsuggested a reasonable answer to me is Professor Kibble. Certainly there should\nbe a common room on level\nfour, but both level four and\neight should be common to\nall. This would take care of\nthe crowding problem. This\nis what Physics Admin\nshould offer the students,\nthey should not have to ask\nfor it.\nAt the moment the students are expected to walk\nin for lectures or lab work\nand then walk straight out\nagain. This is definitely not\na happy state of affairs. The\natmosphere in Physics is\nreally bad; ten per cent of\nthe students in second year\nare registered with the college psychiatrist and receiving treatment. The psychiatrist would agree that there\nwould be fewer cases if the\nstudents felt they belonged\nto the Physics Department.\nI am convinced that the\ntwo suicides from Physics\nlast year could have been\nprevented if there had been\na more homely atmosphere\naround the place. I am\nashamed to admit that my\nDepartment, apart from\nkeeping the matter hush hush\nhave done nothing else. Professor Mathews seems more\ninterested in the Academic\nimprovements possible in\nthe Department \u2014 the\namount of work should be\nbetter spread out, etc.\u2014but\nsurely the atmosphere in\nwhich the work is to be done\nmust be improved first.\nApparently the common\nroom on level eight was obtained by some devious\nmethod. College rules state\nthat there should not be any\ncommon rooms in working\nareas. Technically, the room\nnow used as a common\nroom was recommended as\na conference room. Professor Mathews suggests that it\nwould be impossible to get\nthe matter of an extra common room passed by the College authorities, but a slight\ndiplomatic wangle might get\nus faster results than a blunt\nattack on the rules. He also\npointed out that communication between post-graduates\nwas minimum as well, and\nthat the only place where\nthey got together was the\nlevel eight common room\nwhere they discussed research projects. The com-mon is ation of level four and\neight would override this\nproblem.\nThis simple request for\na common room has caused\nsheer hell in the Department\nand it doesn't leave the new\nhead administrator, Professor\nMathews, very comfortable.\nAnonymity is a word\nevery undergraduate is familiar with; the Physics undergraduate flounders in a wilderness of faces, confused\nand bewildered by the wealth\nof information available. An\nindividual in the largest department in the \"best scientific INSTITUTION in the\ncountry\" has to organise a chaotic deluge of ideas (both\nscientific and otherwise)\neveryday to stay above\nwater. So he either with-draws' into an impenetrable\nshell of apathy, shutting out\ncompletely what he considers trivia, or tries to soothe\nhis privileged conscience by\nmeandering around in the\nschizoid confusion of trying\nto see both sides of a problem at the same time. In\neither case he probably\ncomes to the same conclusion that he holds a one way\nticket from nothing to no-where.\nExceptions will always\noccur. Some in the former\ngroup will manage to isolate\nthemselves in a cocoon of\nphysics and the output will\nbe an un distorted signal, the\nmodel physicist, who will\nprobably end up as a head\nof department.\nThe others engage in an\naimless bustle of social activity in an effort to conceal\ntheir flagging idealism and\namorphous, half realised\ndreams. Adolescent idealists\nfind their methods of attaining inner peace, which they\nconsider! viable, summarily\nrejected even by colleagues\nwho prefer the security of\nthe beaten track and rely on\noften repeated, brief sojourns\nin the quasi-friendly world\nof alcohol.\nS. S.M. Physics undergraduate\n|t f| \u00a7\u00a7:lj\u00a7\nW^09wA iS^^ 'Jllllllt!\nThe room which Ricardo\nnow inhabits was originally\na third year physics work\nroom. It has now become aD.I.C. room, a place where\ntheoretical physicists read\nfor their Diploma of Imperial College.\nLast week Ricardo was\ntreated to a storm of insults\nby the already very popular\nDr. Pain. The following Friday, the twelfth of February, Interaction was to hold\na meeting in the D.I.C. room,\na thing which they .have\nbeen doing for the last two\nmonths, by arrangement with\nthe students who use that\nroom. Around 3.00 p.m., before the meeting started,\nsome third year students\nstormed into the room and\nj started arguing and generally making a nuisance of\nthemselves. The Interaction\ngroup continued the meeting\nand the third year students\nbrought some re-in for cements in. (About fifteen\nmore arrived.) The re-in for cements had been told they\nwould be treated to a keg\nof beer by Dr. Pain if they\nwould duck Ricardo in the\nRound Pond in Kensington\nGardens. The following is\nthe literature distributed by\nthe Interaction Group:\n\"Dr. Pain in a provoked\nincident brought about by\nhis mis-representations incited 15 confused third year\nstudents to disrupt a meeting which Ricardo Turullols,\nP.G., was attending and to\ndrag him to Kensington Gardens where he was deposited\nin the Round Pond \u2014 all\nthis for a keg of beer.\nWhat motivated this ex-naval commander to incite\nstudents to violence? Dr.\nPain and some of his contemporaries seem to be annoyed by Basis Group; he\nsaid that he was 'frightened'\nof Ricardo because 'he's cle-ver' and a 'danger to us.'\nOnly that week the 'entropy\nproducing' Ricardo had been\npublicly insulted by Dr.\nPain, and there are also rumours that certain senior |\nstaff wanted to pass a motion at a staff meeting whereby several active members\nof Basis' Group would be\nexpelled from the College.\nDid Dr. Pain have anything\nto do with it?\nAfterwards, Dr. Pain admitted freely of having\noffered the barrel of beer for\nthe incident. When Professor\nMathews was asked about\nthe activities of Dr. Pain he\nappeared shocked and said,\n\"I'm a bit non-plus sed\". Incidentally Dr. Pain was |\ncaught spying at the General Meeting on the 11th. On j hearing about it a junior\nstaff commented, 'Oh what\na tit'.\"\nSince then Dr. Pain has\napologised to the undergraduates for his absurd be-ha vi our.

Considering the excellent entertainment for\n15/-, it was surprisingly (or\ntypically) supported by only\n100 or so people from I.C. Anyway it made \u00a31,100, of\nwhich Carnival received\n10 per cent.\nSaturday morning saw\ntid d ley winks No 2 which\nturned out 60 enthusiastic\nwin kers and a gorilla, all of\nwhom proceeded along the\nnew underground section of\nthe course from Marble Arch\nto Bond Street, finishing with\ncarol-singing in Piccadilly\nCircus and an attempted\nbreak-in to Emperor Rosko's live Radio 1 show in Lower\nRegent Street.\nIf this wasn't enough for\nany masochist, the Carnival\nXI and a gorilla turned out\non Sunday to play football\nagainst the Thighs XI. The\nfinal score, 7-2 for Thighs,\nwas not surprising considering that half the Carnival\nteam joined forces with the\nThighs at half-time. An exhaustive match which was\nfinished early due to a fascist gardener from Hyde\nPark telling us to b. off and\nthis was followed by a mini-invasion of Speakers' Corner\nwhere the gorilla more than\nmade his presence kown.\nMulti-far io us events oc-cur red, not least the controversial tube collection, so\nhighly praised by the public\nthat 89 letters of congratulation were handed in at Charing Cross. . .\nFitzroy Tavern in Tottenham Court\nRoad for a few small beers;\nthe proprietor seemed unconcerned until the \"unexpected\" timely arrive l of the\nRugby Club en masse from\nU.C., when he finally called\nthe police to clear the premises at half past ten.\nThe two barrels left ruined\nany hope of sponsorship, as\ndid the Met Police who cunningly built a police station\nnot a hundred yards away.\nA quiet Thursday gave\nway to the Carnival Revue\nwith full supporting artist(e)s, and a self-supporting strip-per, delighted us all with her\ntit-ill a ting smiles.\n\" Tailor made\" THE END was in sight on\nSaturday with Miss Julie\nEge-without-the-'D' opening\nthe Carnival fe te half-an-hour late due to her being\nwaylaid in Linstead Hall\nbar. Having cost nothing\nand done everything, she\nwas \"tailor-made\" for the\noccasion, and brought a fitting end to a Carnival Week\nwhich has apparently made\nabout \u00a3800, bringing the\nCarnival total to date to\nabout \u00a33,300.\nELSEWHERE IN FELIX\nPage 2\u2014To Hell with Exams\nPage 3\u2014Judith\nPage 4\u2014Physics\nPage 5\u2014Essex\nPage 7\u2014Sports\nMike Migrates!\nAnd so on till the attempt\nto drink a pub dry on Wednesday morning/afternoon/\nevening when 100 revellers\nturned out to the Fitzroy\nOnly a few weeks after the\ninstallation of I.C.'s mascot\non its plinth, the 4ft. micrometer \"Mike\", has been\nstolen, and the plinth in the\nUnion lower Lounge left\nsmashed, presumably by\nstudents from another College.\nMike's theft was discovered by the Security Guards at\n5.40 a.m. last Friday morn-ing. Maria, the plinth, had\nbeen raped with crowbars\nand chisels, and Mike had\nbeen torn out from its plinth,\ncomplete with clamp a ssem bly. No clues or messages\nwere left at the scene,\nthough a large cold chisel\nwas found on the floor.\nThe raiders appeared to\nhave entered from third floor\nOld Beit Hall, where the\nlink door (fire escape) is not\nlockable. Two windows\nfrom the former S. C.R. onto the roof at street level behind the Union building had\nbeen forced to allow an easy\ngetaway.\nWhen asked to explain how\nits supposedly unbeatable\nalarm system had failed to\ngo off, WHO (the Wooden\nHorse Organisation) said\nthat not all the alarms had\nbeen installed, due to person or persons unknown\npushing their Araldite into\nMaria's locks some time\nago. In any case, no alarms\nwere envisaged to detect\nsmashing of the plinth, as\nsuch a circumstance had\nnever been considered. The\nplinth had always been believed to be un smash able( it\nwas built by I.C. maintenance some years ago, and before any of the present\nmembers of WHO were at\nI.C.) Moreover, the letter\nof challenge sent out to the\nother Colleges in 1966, when\nMike was first installed, had\nspecified that the plinth was\ninviolate.\nAt the time of going to\npress, no clues had been received as to who had stolen\nMike, and so no attempts\nhave yet been made to recover him. However, when\nthe need arises, WHO will\nneed more members\u2014apply\nvia the Union letter rack\n('W'). In the meantime, I.C. carpenters have constructed\na strong wooden chastity\nbox to protect Maria from\nfurther violation, and to\nhide from the Public the remains of her shattered virtue.\n\n"

    "content": "February 25, 1971 FELIX Page 3\nEDITORIAL With Carnival Week over, I.C. seems to have settled back\ninto its customary mode of inactivity. In eight days more\ncontroversial issues were raised than for a whole term pre-vio us. In his week Carnival Co-or d in at or, Dennis Taylor, managed to raise approaching \u00a31000 for Paddington children. The\nattempt to have an \"event\" every day of the week did create\nsome sort of \"rag-week\" atmosphere, but still, there must have\nbeen many hundreds of students who ignored it. Saturday's fe te provided a successful end to the week, and I'm sure most\npeople appreciated Julie Ege giving so much of her valuable\ntime, or simply appreciated Julie Ege.\nThe controversy that has sprung up in Physics over a relatively insignificant event is simply another clash between\npolitically conscious groups in the college. The common-room issue was, at its time of initiation, a perfectly valid and\nnot unfair enquiry. Yet the decision to turn the issue into a political one, immediately stamped it with the seal of failure.\nFrom then on it was simply a fight between Piers et al in\nthe Red corner, and a right-wing faction of Physics 3 in the\nblue. Although I admit my sympathies lie with the left, the\nright's attempts to use intimidation and humiliation to \"win\"\ntheir argument were depressingly typical. What was even\nworse was the encouragement received for Dr. Pain, who\nshould have known better than to let his emotions override his\ncommon sense. Remember the common-room? Well Physics\nUG's are still banned. What was Newton's third law? Interaction and reaction are equal and opposite.\nFELIX299 EDITOR Tony Sims\nASST. EDITORS Mike Yates, Dave Sugden\nPHOTO EDITOR Malcolm Bailey\nNEWS Tony Kirkham\nARTS Charlie Hulme, John Ackers.\nPHOTOGRAPHERS Steve Heap, Malcolm Freedman\nTYPIST Susan Parry\nCARNIVAL NEWS Dennis Taylor\nPRINTED BY F. Bailey & Son Ltd. Dursley, Glos.\nADVERTISING University Press Representation,\nGrand Buildings, Trafalgar Square, WC2\nPUBLISHED by the editor on behalf of ICLI publications\nboard, Prince Consort Road, SW7\nJUDITH Throughout the grants campaign there has been little attention drawn to the plight of postgraduates. The SRC grant\nis \u00a3130 more than the undergraduate award for an\nextra 16 weeks. No wonder the number of PGs is dropping\nand the proportion of overseas research students is in crea s ing. The last grants rise was proportionately less for PGs\u2014\nthe government want to cut down the number of PGs but\nmust it starve them into submission? Already the SRC will\nnot guarantee a third year grant because of 15% cuts in its\nmoney. How much more stringent will the SRC soon have to\nbe? Loans for PGs are not far off unless we act to protect\ntheir rights.\nCollege deliberately seeks to divide the various groups in\nthe university\u2014witness their efforts to destroy the ICRC because the council draws IC people together. All the different\nsections are meant to approach the rector separately, be\n\"consulted\", but never involved in the real power structure.\nThus the Holland club, a purely social entity, is singled out\nas the non-academic staff's representative body, rather than\nthe trade unions. Its meetings are too infrequent and ill-attended to be able to formulate really representative policy.\nAs its executive is almost self-perpetuating, the college can\ningratiate themselves. The trade unions should provide the\nnon-academic staffs representation on the refectory committee instead of the Holland club.\n. Major changes need to be brought about in IC\u2014by staff\nand students acting together to break the hierarchy. Staff\nsuch as Dr. Pain hardly help by seeking to divide. Academic\nstaff are in a weak position\u2014their careers depend on heads\nof departments\u2014as Geoff Sirokin and Dick Atkinson found\nout. Deans (through the dean's committee), heads of departments and a few college administrators run this college,\ndecide its future development, dictate the courses, dole out\nthe money, subject to industry and the government. Undergraduates are barely tolerated\u2014factory fodder. More stu-dents, mean more research money.\nFive reps on the board of studies and three observers on\nthe governing body mean little. We have been denied representation or even observer status on the Deans (or the\nheads of de pts. meetings)\u2014okay we are neither (yet!), but\nwhy aren't these meetings open? Where is the college's academic community? Each department is an empire building.\nLETTERS Open Forum Physics Well folks the first \"Open\nForum\" has been born.\nThese Open Forums are intended to be a series of lecture / debate / discussion /\nsymposiums delving into the\ndeeper questions of our lives\nas university students. The\ntitle of the first one will be\n\"Is Technology Enough?\"\nand the speakers will be Lord\nKearton from Courtaulds,\nSir James Tate from City\nUniversity (ex-C.A.T.) and\nDr. Johnathan Rosehead, a lecturer from LSE and a member of BSSRS. All three\nwill speak and then the question will be thrown open to\nthe floor for you to put your\nown views. All members of\nstaff are welcome and have\nbeen invited. There will be\nrefreshments in the JCR\nafterwards for those who wish,\nto continue the discussion. It\nis hoped that this type of\nforum will become a regular\nevent, and embrace all the\naspects in college so that one\ncan have constructive debate\non these matters. Lord Penney will be in the chair and\nLord Kearton has told me\nhe objects to being asked\nhow much he earns. So come\nalong, ask some questions,\nshow how inadequate/ade-qu ate the courses we do here\nare to us. It's all in the Great\nHall, Thursday, March 11th, at 6.30.\nMark M. Wood\nICU Academic Affairs\nOfficer\nEditor's Message:\nWhy don't you write a letter to Felix?\nDeadline is the Wednesday after each issue.\nPlease don't write more than 300 words.\nDear Sir,\nOver the past few weeks,\nin the Physics department\nthere has been a growing\nfeeling of animosity between\ndifferent factions. This has\nended in Ricardo Turullos\nof basis group Physics getting wet feet and Dr. Pain\nbeing criticised for a tactless\nand inflammatory statement.\nThis train of events only\ngoes to show that instead of\na confrontation (nasty word)\nbetween students and staff\nthere has come about a student vs. student vs. staff situ a tion, which is going to help\nno one, least of all UG's. The main problem in the\nstudent camp is the resentment growing between Interaction (basis group Physics)\nand the \"rest\" over the attitudes towards the 8th floor\nproblem and the Round\nPond affair. The \"rest\" see\nInteraction as a small left ish Corbynish clique which is\ndemanding concessions in a rather crude manner and\nalso distributing an equally\ncrude CEFE-type news sheet\n\u2014 at least one writer of Interaction also writes for\nCEFE. This is perhaps a little unfair since Interaction\nhas some good ideas, e.g.8 th floor common is ation, a larger\nmore representative Staff Student Committee, periodic department meetings etc. Unfortunately their methods have\ntended to lag behind their\nideas, and so the resulting\npolarisation (their word) has\noccurred between staff and\nstudents, and amongst students themselves. \"Inter-action =leftie\" is also unfair\nsince the meetings of the basis\ngroup are open to all Physics\nstudents \u2014 third year Union\nbar / strong men included \u2014\ntechnicians and staff, and the\npeople who do go are not\nall \"leftie\" (which is now a totally meaningless word any-way). So if you want to\nchange Interaction then go\nto their meetings on Fridays\nat 3 p.m. If the UG's in the Physics\ndepartment want to get anywhere in the advancement of\nstaff / student relationships\nthen they must be prepared\nto unite to form a solid front\nand try to produce policies\nsatisfactory to all, and also\nact with a little more tact\nthan of late. Any further\nducking s and insults will only\nlead to a situation whereby\nno part of the UG body will\nhave any standing with the\nstaff, so the sooner common\nsense and tolerance return\nto Physics the better.\nYours faithfully,\nA tired frustrated\nPhysics student.\nWhat' sOn Thursday, 25th February\nC&G ENGINEERING SOCIETY: AGM and Presentation of Faber Prize Competition Paper. 13.15 in EE408.

The former administration's plans, probably\nMoscow-oriented, for a new\nPenney which would have\nwrecked our (n.b.a pun)\neconomy, were ingeniously\navoided by the present regime who, no doubt divinely\ninspired, have made the\npenny worth a lot more than\nit used to be (which was\nmore than a penny in any\ncase owing to the reactionary\nnationalisation of copper\nmines by Zambia).\nFurthermore the Tories\nhave generously inundated\nus with propaganda so elementary that even the Welsh\nare showing signs of understanding it. Furthermore they\nhave provided issues such as\nLaw and Order, Dutschke,\nthe Titanic, devaluation, and\nrationing, compared to which\neven Trotsky's memoirs become boring.\nSo we should all boycott\nthis new Socialist fascist\nmoney \u2014 it hasn't even got\nLenin's head on the reverse,\nwhere it belongs \u2014 and force\nsomebody to resign. In any\ncase I haven't got any money\nso I can't see what all the\nfuss is about. Cheques payable to\nSoss Roberts.\nP.S.

I.C. has\nheard, has reached the front\npage of Sennet, 16-2-71, we\nfeel that it is time the TRUE\nfacts of the incident were\ntold. We are referring to the\nincident in which Ricardo\nTurulloes, P.G., was dragged\nto Kensington Gardens and\nthrown into the Round Pond.\nThe incident began on the\nTuesday before, when some\nthird year students were told\nby aP.G., that the third year\nstudy room had been given to\nthe P.G.' s to work in. That\nnight Dr. Pain was asked to\nclarify the position concerning the room. A second meeting was held with Dr. Pain\non the Thursday morning, in\nwhich he told us that the\nroom was still a third year\nstudy room although a few\nP.G.' s had been given permission to work in there.\nOn Friday afternoon,\nRicardo had called a basis\ngroup meeting in the third\nyear study room. However\nwhen he got there, he found\nfive third year students work-ing. Regardless, he talked to\nhis followers, and when\nasked to be quiet he replied\nthat he had been given permission to work there and\nholding the meeting was his\nwork. After repeated demands for quiet, a heated\nargument started, during\nwhich more third year students came into the room.\nThey are accused of being\n'strong men', but few who\nknew who were in the room\nwould say that. The argument came to a head with a final demand for silence, and\nan offer for both sides to go\nto the head of the department to clarify whether political activity meant work.\nThe answer was 'Why should\nI go to him, let him come to\nme'. The third year students\ndecided that there was only\none course left open to them\nto protect their study room,\nand that was to eject Ricardo. There was no violence as\nRicardo had the sense to\nrealise that it was to no pur-pose, so he walked quiet yi. e. not struggling, to Kensington\nGardens, whereupon he ran\ninto the Round Pond, up to\nhis knees in water, to avoid\nbeing thrown in. He splashed\nthe third year students who\nstood around laughing, and\nthen they returned to college.\nThese are the facts of what\nhappened on that Friday\nafternoon.\nAlthough Ricardo admitted that the incident was\nchildish, the police were\ncalled in to investigate Dr.\nPain's part in it. Whether\nDr. Pain did or did not offer\na barrel of beer is irrelevant,\nthe third year students would\nhave done exactly the same\nthing in the situation as it\nwas. Dr. Pain did not contact\nus, we contacted him about\nthe study room, and if fingers\nare being pointed at people\ninciting violence, we suggest\nthat it was Ricardo who provoked action against himself\nby his attitudes in the study\nroom.\nYours truly,\nNicholas Riley\nJohn Prince\nIt finished about 3 months\nago now, and with the exception of 3 or 4 cheques we\nhave the final balance sheet:\nAltogether collected \u2014\n\u00a31019.87 (with just another\n\u00a325.95 owing).

For the second time in two\nyears, IC 1st XV have\nreached the Gutteridge cup\nfinal to be held at Motspur\nPark on Sat. March 6th. Last Wednesday they decisively trounced UC at\nShenley, the score line really\nflattering the home side.\nPlayed in really wet and\nmuddy conditions, the standard of rugby produced by\nIC was really extraordinary\nand they fully deserve this\nrather unexpected success.\nThe rather well-known\nfigure of the referee awarded\nIC a penalty in the first few\nminutes of the game, accordingly thumped over by the\nevergreen Swinnerton. However UC quickly equalise d by a similar penalty, only\nfor Swinnerton to put over\nhis second attempt of the\ngame. A third attempt\nfloated wide only for\n(bald y?) Hollingsworth to\ncollect, the IC pack to win\nyet another ruc k and the\nball fed out to second-row\nman Owens who crushed\n(not sidestepped, Steve) his\nway over for a try which\nSwinnerton converted.\nThis gave the signal for a prodigious onslaught of IC\npressure \u2014 the pack playing some really sterling stuff.\nAgainst the run of play UC\npulled back to 11 pts. to 9\npts. through a penalty and a dropped goal \u2014 however\nwinger Anderson scored an\nopportunist (lucky?) try\nwhich brought his season's total to 21. This score of\n14-9 remained until half-time.\nThe pace of the second-half slowed considerably\nand as the conditions gradually worsened, only the discipline and fer v our of the\nIC side kept UC out. From\none of the numerous forward foot rushes IC gained\npossession for Swinnerton\nto crush over for a try\nwhich he narrowly failed to\nconvert this score of 17-9\nremained into injury time\nuntil the UC fly half who had\na really brilliant game kicked\ntwo penalties to bring UC\nwithin two points of the IC\nscore. However the referee\nfinally gave up and blew the\nwhistle to the delight of\nnumerous IC supporters.\nhard fought cup match\nevery IC player emerged\nwith honour but I'm sure\nthe team would not begrudge\nHollingsworth a special\nmention \u2014 he did more to\nattract attention than merely\nflash his bald head around.\nThe pack's splendid effort\nwas fully supported by the\nfine play of halfbacks James\nand Harrison \u2014 still Swinnerton got 11 pts. as per\nusual!\nRemember the final \u2014\nfree coaches, a splendid\nafternoon's enjoyment at\nMotspur.\nTeam: Pudney, Anderson,\nMarriott, Conolly, Flunt,\nJames, Harrison, Widelski,\nMichael, Hollingsworth,\nOwens, Mathews, Adams\n(Capt.), Icely and SwinnerOut of this immensely ton.\nMen's Hockey\nUL CUP SEMIFINAL IC 0, Guys Hosp. 1\nBoth sides started nervously and it was Guys who\nfirst began to settle down\nand after five minutes play-forced a short corner. The\nresulting shot was stopped\non the line by the right back\nand Guys easily converted\nthe penalty flick. This\nseemed to inspire the IC forwards who constantly attacked the hesitant Guys1\ndefenders, and were eventually awarded a penalty flick\nafter a short corner. Dave\nWilson, attempting to score\nhis fourteenth goal of the\nseason took the stroke, but\nit was well-saved by the\ngoalkeeper.\nThe first half continued\nwith the Guys' goal under\nconsiderable pressure and\nthere was no further score\nbefore half-time. In the\nsecond half, the pattern of\nthe game became quite\nclear: IC constantly attacking an eight or nine man de-fence. Short corners were\nawarded at frequent intervals but none of the set\nEDITORIAL\nAgain as one looks around to wide and desolate spaces\nof Sports page, one wonders whether some clubs exist at all\nor are so good as not to wish to lower themselves by sending\naccounts to Felix! Still, that filled three copy lines \u2014 even if\nI do mean it!\nAs many residents of South Side will probably know the\nHyde Park relay is upon us \u2014 or rather will have happened\nby this edition. The various international sides competing\nhave produced an interesting side result. The Spanish University side brought with them their Director of Sport who was\ninterested in forming sporting(?) associations with IC, especially in the fields of soccer, rugby, basketball and athletics.\nThis could be very interesting to those clubs considering going abroad next year \u2014 for any further information please\ncontact me or the Hyde Park relay organiser.\nSad to relate, the men's Hockey XI were knocked out\nof their cup competition by Guy's last week \u2014 a question of\nnot being able to get the ball into the net only, I gather. The\nsoccer 1st XI cancelled their intended cup match against\nGoldsmith's when the referee turned out to be none other\nthan a Goldsmith's student; we wish them luck when they\neventually do play \u2014 after the captain returns from trips to\nhome etc.\nWill they join the 1st XV and the women's hockey XI\nat Motspur on March 6th \u2014 from a purely Bacchanalian\n(topical?) point of view, I hope not.\nmoves worked and Guys\nhung on to the final whistle.\nIt must be mentioned that\nthis was the first defeat of\nthe 1st team by a college\nside this season, and that\nthe team played with great\nRecord\nP27W19 D3 enthusiasm, but for the\nsecond time in three years\nthe hockey club has failed\nin the semi-final.\nOther Results:\nIC 0, Gt Western Railway 1\nTC 4, Kings College, Ldn. 0\nL Goals for against\n5 66 17\nFight on to Final University College II0 Imperial College II1 On Wednesday, 17th of\nFebruary, I.C. met U.C. in\nthe semi-final of the Cup. It\nwas wet and windy and consequently the conditions were\nnot very conducive for attractive football. As was ex-pec ted, the game was evenly\ncontested, for the two previous meetings between these\nteams have ended in draws.\nIn the first half, the I.C. team played against the wind\nand against the gradient, the\nintention being to hold the\nopposition in the first half\nand then to capital is e on the\nnatural advantages in the\nsecond. The defence carried\nout its task efficiently and the\nopposition had no real scoring chances. The forwards,\nhowever, after many intelligent build-ups, did not seem\nto be able to put the ball into the net. Pete Lonnen in\nparticular, created several\nsituations, which would normally have resulted in goals\nbut at half-time there was no\nscore.\nThe start of the second\nhalf saw the I.C. forwards\ntrying desperately to open\nthe scoring, but poor finishing kept the score sheet\nblank. U.C. then began to\nget into the game and until\nthe end of the game, pressed\nforward continuously. During this assault, the I.C. defence kept their ground extremely well, particularly\nJohn Jenkins, Paul Maslin\nand Rick Widelski. At full-time the score was 0-0.\nAgainst the wishes of the\nentire I.C. team, the referee\nand the U.C. players insisted\nthat extra-time should be\nplayed. The aggression invoked in the I.C. team by this\ndecision proved to be the deciding factor in the match.\nThroughout extra-time I.C. were well on top and it was\nevident that a goal must soon\ncome. It finally came in the\nsecond period of extra-time.\nPete Lonnen put over a good\ncross from the left and Alan\nThebault went up for it with\nthe U.C. goalkeeper. From\nthe resulting collision, the\nball ran loose to Dave Sanderson, who had worked\ntirelessly throughout the\ngame, and he prodded it into the net.\nWith only a few minutes\nremaining U.C. launched an\nall out attack to try and\nequalise. They would have\nbeen successful but for a brilliant save by Bob Barley\nin the dying seconds.\nThe I.C. seconds have now\nplayed twenty-four games\nthis season without defeat\nand look capable of repeating last season's performance,\nwhere they won both the\nLeague and Cup competitions.
