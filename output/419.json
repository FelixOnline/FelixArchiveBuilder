    "content": "JJUJJL\nSeviews\nBooks\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn \u2014 Gulag\nArchipelago vol 2 (Fontana 695pp, \u00a31.00)'.\nWHEN I FIRST read volume one of this\nthree volume history of the Russian Terror\n(before, during and after the Stalinist\nperiod), I thought that it was the most\ndisturbing thing I had ever read. The\nfirst volume dealt mainly with the\ninterrogation and transport of prisoners \u2014\nthis book is almost entirely devoted to\nthe destructive labour camps themselves.\nIt was not difficult to find oneself in\nsuch a camp; Solzheritsyn records hundreds\nof individual stories. For example, the\nfarmer who swore at his cow; the deaf\nmute who hung his jacket on a bust of\nLenin - ten years! The couple sentenced\nfor holding a spiritualist sean ce; the\nalcoholic who received eight years for\ndrinking! And when one individual was arrested, all the members of his family\nwere pulled in as well, and all their\nneighbours who had failed to inform on\nthem! We must not forget the thousands of\nOnly for strong stomach\npeople pulled in off the streets at random\nand given ten or twenty year sentences!\nThe picture is indeed horrifying. Very\nfew survived their sentences - and those\nwho did so were immediately given\nadditional terms!\nWhat was the purpose of all this?\nPartially, the author explains, to provide\na slave labour force, but primarily to\nforce the population into a fear of\nstepping out of line, of daring to criticise authority or any aspect of the state. The\nwork for which the slave labour was used\nwas not always urgent or even useful. For example, the Stalin White SeaB al tic Canal, built on a whim of the\nleader in twenty months. During one\nwinter 100,000 men, women and children\n(yes, and it was policy to divide families\ninto different camps) died on this one\nproject \u2014 and their bones can be seen in\nthe concrete of the canal. This canal served and serves no\nnaval use whatsoever. But it provided\none more pit to devour the socially undesirable elements.\nIt is interesting to follow the corruption,\neven of socialism, within the camps; the\ndevelopment of a rigid class structure; the\never increasing use of competition and\nincentives in order to fulfill the work\nnorms; and the large scale cheating\nused to receive higher rations.\nWe are told how this corruption leaked\nout into society at large and we receive\nother valuable insights into that society. One sentence, in particular, stands out \u2014\n\"out of every four to five city dwellers\nthere would most certainly be one who at\nleast once in his life had received a proposal to become an informer\".\nThis is certainly more disturbing than\nVol One \u2014 I advise you not to read it\nunless you have a strong stomach'\nD. Everett\nA remarkable tale\nTS Eliot: The Great Literary Hoax by\nLB Gowers (Penguine 60p)'. IN 1917 EB Hatchard, a young Cambridge\nDon, published \" Pr uf rock and other\nobservations\" under the pseudonym of\nTS Eliot. This collection of \" poems\" was intended as a satire on Ezra Pound,\nwhose irreverent and frivolous pe om s had\nirritated Hatchard. One example of this\nfrivolity is Ph y lli du la, which, perhaps\nsuggests a classical poem, but starts\n\" Ph y lli du la is scrawny but amorous\". The portrait of the whimsical but rather\npretentious young man in \" The Love Song by J Alfred Pr uf rock\" was intended\nto represent Pound's poetry.\nThe next poem, \" A Portrait of a Lady', parodies Pound's 'Portrait d 'une Femme'\nby use of a complete antithesis of\nstyle. Hatchard chose the name 'TS Eliot'\nbecause it is an anagram of toilets, the\nonly place Hatchard felt suitable for\nPounds poetry.\nA further collection was published in\n1920, which included the notorious\nand obscurely obscene Sweeny Poems.\n(In fact, Sweeny Erect includes a graphic\ndescription of intercourse behind the\nfacade of words.)\n' The Waste Land', the next to be\npublished, and the most famous poem,\nparodies not only Pound, to whom it is\ndedicated, but also others such as\nRupert Brook, (the first part is an\nanalogue of his 'Gruntchester', and also working class speech, cf the latter part\nof ' A Game of Chess', with its grating\nshe said s.) These satine s were initially circulated\nonly in Cambridge, until 1932 when a pupil of Hatchard's,FR Leavis, published\nan essay ' New Bearings in English Poetry' (available in Pelican). Since\nthen, the joke has spread far beyond the\nconfines of Cambridge, and as a result of\nfurther ' ec position' by various dilettantes,\nwhat originally began as a scholastic joke is now taken seriously by many\ndabblers in poetry.\nThis remarkable tale of a pseudonym\nwhich became one of the best known poets\nof this century provides much to amuse\nthose more interested in this area,\nalthough much of the original humour of\npoems is lost, since attitudes and\nfashions have changed so much. The\nstyle of the book makes it fairly easy\ngoing, although some of the detailed\nanalysis becomes dull, as do most jokes\nwhich have to be explained. This is a book I would thoroughly recommend,\nalthough to those few IC students who\nhave heard of TS Eliot, it may come as an\nembarrassment to realise that they have\nbeen duped. Hilax\nMusic\nBetter than Skol\nTHIS LP stands out, with few others,\nas one of the really worthwhile musical\nefforts of the last twelve months and,\ntreads the ground that good music should\ntend towards \u2014 quality songs, great,\nclean, production, most important of all, peerless musicianship \u2014 guys who are\ncapable of playing whatever is asked of\nthem and of constantly inventing within any\ntime\u2014signature or background you care\nto choose. Beautiful, beautiful, sounds cover\nboth sides. Moody and yet cares singly soft acoustic piano/orchestra 'sound\neffect interludes slotted between some\nof the sharpest rhythmic jazz yet produced\nby the new wave artists, such as Billy Cobham, Horble Hancock, and Return\nto Forever (with whom Lenny White is\nresident percussion maestro), that are\nfinally receiving some of th3 popularity\nthey deserve.\nTrtere are also some excellent, new,\naxe nen on this album (nam<3checks for\nRaymond GO. TV BZ and Doug Rodriguez \u2014\nbig futures there) and who w jul d have\nthought ex-santa;i oid Doug Rauch capable\nof such ferociously fine bass buzzing,\nconsidering the number of mantras and\n<V:r to compositions the poor sod's had\nto endure. Santana could well be better\noff doing this instead of allowing CBS to release cheap o,di relic t, live, triple \u2014\nalbum recordings from some obscure\nNip Astrodome.\nSo while everybody looks around for\nguitarists with enough guts, brains, and\nsure touch to *av age some horizon,\nalbums of this quality go unnoticed, and\ntoys like Queen get landed on us as the\nmes i ahs of the new. year. If you want\nto hear a real guitar solo, worthy of\nrestoring yer faith in the instrument,\nlisten to the opening minutes of \" Mating Drive\" on side two \u2014 a mass of power\nplaying and invention unlikely to be\nheard elsewhere for some time, and the\nunstoppable beat makes the number\nmore Invogorating than the proverbial\nknee-tremble rs. Forget Skol \u2014 this\nrefreshes you best. It's even more\nmemorable for It's complete dissimilarity to the anaemic pop \" music\" currently\nchurned out by the media.\nJust feast your ears on this beauty.\nNothing but unreserved praise Is deserving\nfor Lenny White, his cohorts, and the\nfar-seeing, clear-th ln king, cog nos centi of Atlantic Records (standing ovation)\nfor making available such a good record\nagainst recent trends. Great stuff!\nHIC\n\n"

    "content": "mix s How to complain-effectively\na) As a consumer\nUnder the Sale of Goods (Implied\nTerms) Act1973 you are entitled to\nreturn any faulty article to the retailer\nfrom which you purchased it. You can have your money back and do not have\nto accept a replacement, repair or credit\nnote unless you chose to. Expenses incurred due to the fault can also be\nclaimed from the shop. Exceptions not\ncovered by the Act are services such as\ndry cleaning and goods bought at an\nauction. Nor* can you complain if the\nfault was brought to your attention in the\nshop or if you examined the article\nbefore purchase and could reasonably\nhave noticed any defects.\nHaving decided to complain, what\ndo you do? Take the goods back to the\nshop with the re ce it. If you obtain no\nsatisfaction write to the Head Office by\nregistered letter. The LSE law students\nat the Welfare Centre can help you with\nthis. If this does not bring results you\ncan t alte the matter to court. For articles\nworth less than \u00a3100 this will only cost\nyou \u00a35 which is returnable if you win the\ncase. Again the LSE students can advise\nyou.\nIn a private sale, for example, buying\na car from a private motorist, it is up to\nyou to examine the vehicle. You may\nand should, as in any sale, check that the\nseller is the rightful owner. Redress is possible if, for example, the car is not as described with respect to age or mileage.\nb)As a letter writer\nComplaints about the GPO should\nfirst be taken to the local PostOffice. If you get no joy then, check if there is a local Post Office Advisory Committee\n(Addresses at the Welfare Centre or in the phone book). These are independent\nvoluntary bodies which advise the GPO about local consumer needs. Another\nsource of help is the Post Office Uses National Council( PO UNO, Tel:01/9289458. They are also an independent body\nand exist solely to represent the consumer.\nc)As an NHS patient\nYou are legally entitled to be treated\nwith 'reasonable' care and skill. If you think you have suffered due to negligence\non the part of aGP, den test optician, or\nchemist contact the local Family Practitioners' Committee. If the complaint\nconcerns an hospital contact the Hospital\nAdministrator. Advice on how to complain\ncan be obtained from your local community\nHealth Council. Addresses at the\nwelfare Centre or in the phone book.\nd)As a rate payer\nIf you wish to complain about\nmal administration by a local authority,'\nor water authority you can make a complaint\nthrough that authority to the local Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is an\nindependent Commissioner who can look\ninto the way things are handled, but not\nthe merits of any decision made by the\nauthority. Contact the Welfare Centre for\nfurther details.\nWe are open Mon \u2014 Fri12.30 \u2014 1.30pm; legal advice on Wednesdays, and are\nlocated at the top of the Union. Appendices\n1.

Anyone interested contact\nme through Union letter racks or at the\nCentre.\n3. HELP! Nearly all the Centre's helpers\nare leaving this summer. Anyone interested\nin helping out for one lunchtime a week\nplease come and see me at the Centre.\nSue Kali c in ski Smug, uncritical IC\nBURN THE WORK SHEETS! No joke; I am deadly serious.\nBurn the heretic you all cry, but\nbefore you do, Let me explain, for those of you who can imagine a world without them \u2014\nno harder than to imagine life\nafter death or oblivion, as the\ncase may be, why 1 think they\nare an insult to intelligence.\nAnyone who does not know\nwhat a work-sheet is should\nbe rejoicing and should check\nthat they are at IC or that they\nhave not been attending\ncourses elsewhere, erroneously.\nI do not blame the people who\nproduce them \u2014 they are\ninvolved in \"more important\"\nthings and have no time to\nworry about the educational\nmerits of the work-sheet and\nlet's face it, most people at\nIC actually believe they want\nto do them \u2014 ma soci sts! The ones I receive are\nmaster pieces among work-sheets, but does this channelling\nand normalisation of my\nidea do me or anyone else any good?\nThis raises the question of\nthe function of education in\nsociety. Whatever may be said, only someone living in\ncuckoo land could claim the\nsystem was not producing, at\nal! levels, people with\nregimented, stereotype minds\n\u2014 an easy to handle commodity,\nbut for whom? Will they treat\nus like any other consumable?\nWho are the users?\nForgive me for thinking that\nonly one subject is taught at\nundergraduate level - that is conform itty, perhaps we have\nsome \" users\" here. Everyone\nlook up from your micro cosmic worlds, can you see any?\nFactory fodder does not change\nin essence over the years, or\nup the educational ladder, it\njust gets more sophisticated;\naccountancy fodder or technical\nfodder.\nWhat about work sheets,\nthat method of education that\nshould have died out with\nph log is ton theory: Denied of\nthe Zombi activity of putting\nnumbers into equations what\ncould you do? Start thinking!\nYou would have nothing better\nto do than the subject you came here for. What was it\ncalled now? Society strives to\nnegate experience: a second\nlaw of thermodynamics operates\nin reverse, if you let it, the\nways in which you think and\nact will all be determined for\nyou.\nSocially, what goes on at\nthis College? Tradition\ndemands that you get drunk\nevery other night and the\nnights in between spent in\nconverse on the art of throwing-up and what a swine you can be towards women and other\nminorities. From your first day\nthe unions make quite sure the\nmindless tradition will never\nbe forgotten.\nThere is a social alternative.\nSpend your evenings in your\nown clique expanding the\nfrontiers of bourgeois idea ology. How much have you experienced\nof your subject life, each other\nsince you came here? The opportunities exist, why not\nmake the most of them? Burn\nthe work sheets. It is a step\nin the right direction and\nperhaps it could stop the\nturning that must be going on\nin the Huxley' s family grave.\nStephen Humby\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE WIND ENSEMBLE Outdoor Concert\nThe Queen's Tower, Imperial College Suppe: Overture: Light Cavalry Elgar: March: Pomp and Circumstance No.1 TSCHAIKOWSKY : 1812 OVERTURE\nQueen's Tower Bells rung by the University of London Bell Ringers Pyrotechnics by the Imperial College Dramatic\nSociety\n1.00pm Tuesday May 18 1976 All Welcome\nFELIX Photographic\nCompetition\nThe competition is open to all staff and students\nof Imperial College, except members of tbe FELIX staff.\nThis year all entries must be B& W or Colour prints.\nThere will be nine categories:\nB& W Portrait\nLandscape\nNatural History\nPhotojournalism\nGeneral\nCOLOUR Portrait\nLandscape\nNaturaJ History\nGeneral\n1.

Telephone Bills- PO errors or student fiddle?\nPhoneHang-ups\nPO backs down on 2 Hall bills\nCONFUSION NOW surrounds the profitability of 'call-box'\nphones in halls of residence following Monday's meeting of\nthe Finance Sub-Committee of the College Student Residence\nCommittee (SRC)*. At the meeting Wardens and student\nrepresentatives heard that bills from the Post Office ( PO) for the use of these phones exceeded cash re cie pts by a staggering \u00a3 4 , 9 0 5 for this session alone'.\nThe figures presented to the\nmeeting showed deficits of\n\u00a31338 for the Be it Hall Phones, \u00a31548 for those inTi zard Hall and \u00a31578 for those in L instead Hall. This information was confirmed by the College finance\ndepartment on Wednesday.\nInvestigation\nThe College' has asked the\nPO to investigate the discrepancies to eliminate any\npossibility of meter errors at\ntheir end. Just prior to going\nto press FELIX understands\nthat the Post Office has backed down over their bills for Ti zard and L instead Halls. They have yet to report back\non the bill for Be it Hall. There is a strong likelihood\nthat they will back down here\nas well since one phone in Be it was billed for an extraordinary \u00a3600 in February.\n\" No comment\"\nContacted by FELIX, the\nPO declined to comment on the\ndiscrepancies and a spokesman\nfor the Engineering department\nsaid it was strictly a matter\nbetween IC and the PostOffice. The current situation arises\nbecause College officials empty\nthe ' call box' phones every\ntwo weeks and the PO bill IC by their meter readings at\nPO exchange every month.\nLast year the College made\na net loss of \u00a383 for all the\ncall-box phones in halls of res-i den ce. Until February, the\nS RC had budgeted for the same\nloss this year. However, phone\nbills then increased the estimate to \u00a3775. Last Monday, this\nfigure was again raised, this\ntime to \u00a35,000, in the wake of\nthe Post Office bills. The figures have brought to\nthe surface the state of disrepair of some P.O. phones in the\nhalls. Ron Kill, sub warden of\nTi zard Hall, complained that\n'the phones are not maintained\nproperly'. Further, one of the\nTi zard phones is currently giving free calls. Mr Kill was unaware whether this had been\nreported to the College or the\nG.P.O. Another incident occured last\nFebruary (197 5) whe n two phone s in L instead Hall were forcibly\nrobbed.\nAuthorities baffled\nAt present the College authorities are baffled by the phone\nbill discrepancies, other than\nsuggesting a mistake at the\nPost Office end. Nevertheless\nin 1973 a former IC student was\nprosecuted for fraudulent use of\nG.P.O. phones at I C.At that\ntime the College was concerned\nover the number of students\nobtaining free calls by using\nengineers* special codes. FELIX understands that this\nloophole has now been closed. Other illegal practices in this field include the use of\n'tone boxes' and wire tapping\nto electrically simulate the insertion of coins. A telephone\nengineer con acted by FELIX said that elaborate methods\nwould be required to accomplish\nthis. He did not say that either\nwere beyond the ingenuity of IC students.\nAGM report\nAt the AGM yesterday Bill Gerrard, Ron Kill and John\nDowns were awarded the Union\nGeneral Award by IC Union\npresident Peter Teague. The awards were made in recognition\nof their services to the Union.\nSocial Colours and ACC Athletic Colours were also aw-ard ed. Ian Morse and Gill McCon way, the two full-time staff\nwho work on FELIX, were\nawarded Social Colours as was\nJohn McCloskey who has been\nthe FELIX Technical Manager\nfor the past two years.\nThe meeting also discussed hall and house rents and refectory prices. It had been decided at an S RC meeting that\nthere would be attempts to make\nthe residence accounts break\neven next year. However, this\nwould mean a30% increase in rents to raise the \u00a380,000 required. Southside hall rents would\ngo up from \u00a37.25 to \u00a39.40 and house rents for single rooms\nfrom \u00a36.20 to over \u00a37.\nThe meeting decided that any\nrent increases must keep rents\nwithin the national element for\naccommodation as allowed in the student grant.\nA10% flat increase in refectory prices and allowing them to\nfloat with commodity prices had\nbeen put forward by the Catering\nManager, but the proposal met\nwith a cool reception. In view\nof the Union's policy that refectory prices should only go up\nonce a year, a suggestion by\nJohn Downs that we opt for a large flat percentage increase\nseems likely to be the line fol lowed in negotiations with the\nCollege. Jez conks out\nJ EZ, the RCS' s1916 Dennis\nfire engine, suffered severe\ndamage when she broke down on\nKing's Road, Chelsea last\nSunday afternoon. The damage\ncaused is estimated at over\n\u00a31000.\nThe fire engine stuttered to\nahu lt with pieces of metal left\ntrailing behind it. It appears\nthat a camshaft journal moved\ninto the path of the No.3 con-rod which bent the other\ncamshaft and broke the con-rod.\nThis con-rod then cracked the\npiston and put holes in the\ncrank case and sump.\nJ ez was towed back to its\ngarage behind the Biochemistry\nbuilding by Exploration Board's K9 lorry.\nEarlier in the day, J ez had taken part in the FELIX Treasure\nHunt which was narrowly won\nby the Bo' team. Beaten into\nsecond place were the RCS second team of Dave Dodge,\nGraham Paterson and Nigel Davies. This was the second treasure\nhunt organised by F ELK and a full complete nt of teams from\neach C CU took part. The contestants found the clues\nso difficult that, in retribution,\nsome of them dumped Paul Bentley' scar inside Be it Archway thus blocking it. Attempts to put the car inside\nthe FELIX Office failed\nbecause the doors are not\nwide enough.\n\n"

The record entry of 40\nhad been reduced to the eight\nquarter finalists who were\npaired thus:- To mAde y v Andy Gribble; Steve Jones v Mike Gibson; Andy Slack v Steve Moorhouse and Alan Whatling v Richard Parmentero\nFor those intrigued by\ncoincidences all the tosses\ncame up heads and the player\nfrom the bottom half draw won\n2\u20140, though those score lines might be misleading with\nrespect to the quality of play\nin these matches. Despite the\nconsiderable tension involved,\nthe finals were of a high\nstandard and provided a great\ndeal of entertainment on the\nnight. The highest score in this\nround and, in fact, of the whole\nevening was Andy Gribble's137(602057) who only had123 to get at the time.\nCompetent finishing proved\nto be the decisive factor in these matches and the semifinals were no exception.\nDespite the wildly fluctuating\nscore, players tended to\nfinish together which meant\nthat the slow scorers were\nable to take advantage of the\nfaster scorers' poor finishing\nability. Thus Steve Moorhouse\nand Mike Gibson ran out winners]\nover Richard Parmenter and\nAndy Gribble respectively. The stage was then set for\na tense, all left-handed final. Steve won the toss in this\n\" best of five\" final and\npromptly stormed ahead with\nthrows of 101, 100 and 60.\nHis bad finishing, after\nreaching a double top, was\npunished by Mike who had been\ndoggedly chasing him.\nHowever, this proved to be\nMike's last fling as his nerves\nbecame the better of him and\nSteve took the next three\ngames in succession. So after\nnumerous attempts Steve\nfinally won the Fremlin and denied Mike the opportunity of\nholding both major IC darts\ntitles in the same year.\nPau' WhiVock\n1F Only:.\nYOU ARE about to read the\nfirst gripping installment of a new series of IF Only s.( After\nan introduction like that I doubt very much whether you're\nabout to read anything of the\nkind).

I would like to list below\nsome of the absurd statements\nmade in the review:\n1. Quote \" . . . the bulk of Head's efforts earn him zero for star\nquality\" Murray head was for a couple of years the original\nJudas in \" Jesus Christ\nSuperstar\", one of the main\nparts in the show. Besides this\nMr Head is playing support to\nElton John on his latest tour -zero for star quality, obviously!2. Quote \" He might well have\nbeen flustered by his first\nventure to a recording studio''\nFirst venture!! As previously\nstated, he played the part of\nJudas on the stage and also on\nthe original sound track (possibly on the film as well, but\nI'm not too sure). As well as this he released an LP on\nCBS called\" Nigel Lived\". The LP took the form of a diary of a boy who comes down\nto the big city ie London to\nseek fame and fortune, but\ngets in with different types\nand eventually ends up a drug addict. The LP has a few\ntrite songs; but the overall\nsound is good, and was well\nreceived by most of the critics in the genuine music papers.\nThus, this is Murray Head's third venture into the studio\nand, in my most liv i ble opinion seeing that we people\noutside the literary field\nknow so little about music, his best so far. I have to agree\nabout the song \" You' re so\nTasty\", but all of the others\nare done in the usual superb\nMurray Head style.3. Quote \"Murray Head has\n...yet to discover what he does\nbest\". If he doesn't do anything\nwell then why was a whole\nprogramme dedicated to him\nand his music on Capital Radio a few weeks ago? Surely,\nthey must know what is going\nto draw the audiences away\nfrom the BBC stations.\n4. Quote \" . . . or Head is low\non talent. Judging from the\nfrail vocals I suspect the\nlatter\".\nI feel that I have said\nsufficient to show that he is not that low on talent, and, in fact, very far from it.\nAbout the songs: George\nMelly May be able to do a version of \" Someones Rocking\nMy Dreamboat\" which is\ncloser to the original 1920's version of the song but the\nMurray Head version is how he\nwants to do it, not how you want\nhim to do it. What about\n\" Never Even Thought\" and\n\" Silence is a Strong Reply\" they stand out even more\nthan \" Boats Away\" and\n\" Don't Forget Him Now\". In future I ask; please don't tell everything that you think\nyou know about an artist when\nin fact you know nothing.\nThat is about all that I really wish to gripe about. Be warned, the reader doesn't like printed ignorance.\nYours,\nW.P.

Our three\nthrowers all found this\nevent a little difficult, but with\na little determination and a lot\nof strength each managed\ncommendable distances gaining\nsecond fourth and fifth places.\nOur one sprinter, Alan\nGregory was IC's only sprint\nfinalist of the day coming\nfifth in the hundred metres.\nThe first success of the\nday came in the 3000 metres\nsteeplechase, Rob Allinson\nstormed round the seven and\na half laps unconcerned about\nhis two foot landing technique\nin the water jump to finish\nfirst.

A dubious style of walking down\nthe back straight by some\nopposition meant the IC had to\nbe content with second and\nfourth place.\nAndy Davey salvaged a point from the 400m hurdles,\nan event in which we definitely\nmissed IC's Dave West.\nWith wet spikes dried in the\nbaking sun, Rob All in son proceeded to win the 5000m at\na steady pace, just fast enough\nto keep the second place man,\nSteve Webb from trying anything\nfast on the last lap.\nAn hour later the temperature had dropped below 7 0 * F and seven coughing IC runners\nwent back on to the cinder\ntrack to start the 1500m. The field of twenty runners\nset off at a brisk pace and at\n1000m to go IC were holding\n2,3,4,5,6 positions.

    "content": "MU X7 Bike Club. Bleasdale\nmakes his mark\nOrienteering\nThrown off course\nTHERE WAS definitely\nsomething suspicious about\nthe activities of several of our\nsenior oriente ers last weekend.\nFirstly, David Rosen, running\nthe Olympic marathon trial at\nRotherham, and thus disdaining\nto take part in the Southern\nNavigator's Event at Lower\nBourne Forest near Farnham.\nThen, on Sunday morning\nitself, Alan Leakey prof erring vague excuses about not\nrunning, otherwise engaged,\netc, and gu izzi cal glances from\nthe rest of us, who were\npuzzled why this particular\nevent should seem so avers ive, especially on a blistering May\nday.\nIt was not.until we reached\nour destination that we saw the\nlight of day. Owing to a limited supply of maps, the\norganisers had fitfully decided\nthat competitors on the ' A' and ' B' courses should run\n'Map Memory' - which basically entailed trying to memo rise the\ncourse, not in whole (perhaps\nthis fate will await us shortly),\nfrom control to control. Those\nnew to this type of competition\nenvisaged orienteering without\na map being somewhat akin to\nkami kaz i. Undaunted, we rose to the\noccasion in differing orders of\nmagnitude. On the ' A' course,\nClive Reid in 85.15 and Steve\nWebb in 105.31 managed to\novercome the technical\ndifficulties of the latter part\nof the course, which forced Ian\nIsherwood to retire. To add\ninsult to injury, Steve later\nshowed Ian his mistake. On the\nshorter ' B' course, which was\nreally the first 1/3 rds of the\nMINING HOUSE triumphed in the\nRSM 6 \u2014 Aside soccer competition last Saturday, by\ndefeating Mat Met 1, 2\u20140 in\nthe semi-final and Geology 2 A,2 \u20141 in the final. Mining house\nfailed to produce their expected\nfluent, enterprising football in\nthe early league matches,\nthough still getting through to\nthe last four. The semi-final\nand final were entirely different\nstories with Mining house\nproducing some exhilarating\nplay. In the semi-final a brilliant move, involving\n' A' course, Tim Murphy in\n95.25 narrowly beat Mike\nWelford by two minutes.\nFortunately, both courses\nwere not too challenging,\nthough many would testify that\nthe dense forest areas were to\nbe avoided at all costs. Enterprisingly, three of our\naccompaniment declined the\nchallenge, and chose the ' C course, a chance to employ\nreal orienteering techniques\nwith a proper map, and humorously picture the quixotic\nadventures of the fool-hardy.\nOn a course slightly shorter\nthan the ' B' course, Hans\nAchtrick, a friend of Alan's, found the terrain to his liking,\nrecording 52.57; Jon Gibbins\n(66.05) and Diane Benge\n(74.15) in creditable times,\nenforced the rule that navi gating with a map was a much\nmore time-saving pastime\nthan relying on an ever-forgetful memory.\nFor those who are interested\nin this mentally-exacting,\nthough not necessarily\nphysically-demanding sport, the club holds weekly lunchtime\nmeetings every Friday in the\nUnion Senior Common Room,\nwhere you will learn more of\nour activities, both sporting\nand social, to which all are\nwelcome.

In the final\nGeology 2A made Mining house\nwork hard, but through agile\ngoal keeping by Mayo, three\nefforts by Duncan which hit\nthe cross bar, and two well \u2014\ntaken individual goals by\nFrampton, Mining house were\ndeserved winners. Congratulations must go to the organisers\nand the teams for making it such\nan enjoyable day's soccer.\nIn the second of a world\nshattering series of\nappearances, Martin Ble as dale took his Kawasaki400 to the\nBemsee Ace of Clubs Road\nRaces at Snetterton (near\nNorwich) on May 1st. The\nglory was to be all Martin's as our other racer, Nick James,\nhad left his Velocette in\nBirmingham (so he claimed)\nand could not compete. Instead,\nhe was relegated to racing\nthe van!\nPractice was at 11am for\nthe Kawasaki and, unfamiliar\nwith the circuit, Martin took a slight detour along the grass\nverge at Sears Corner, doing a sedate 60mph. The marshals\nlooked quite pet urbe d! On the\nsecond and successive tries, a more conventional cornering\nstyle was adopted.\nMartin's first race was the\n100cc Production Race, with\nmachines such as Honda\n750-4s, Norton Commandos\nand, of course, Yamahas,\nSt Johns College, Cambridge\nusually provide strong opposition\nand this year was no exception. IC 1st XI travelled down feeling\nconfident yet were narrowly\nbeaten in a surprisingly low\nscoring match.\nAn early collapse and then\na painfully slow accumulation\nof 128 runs left St Johns ample\ntime to score the required runs.\nSeveral of IC's batsmen were\nout playing premeditated shots,\nfrustrated by the persistent\naccuracy of the oppositions\nbowling. The collapse was slow and the resistance strong yet\nthe performance was feeble\nand very tedious.\n200 again\nA WEEK AGO on Wednesday\nIC 1st XI played South Stanmore\nat Harlington. After a very\nbrisk start of 48 runs in 20\nminutes (Tom Ghosh 3 1 ,\nTony Paul 27) there was a lull in the scoring, but once\nVick Brown (76 not out) and\nRichard Pashley (52 not out)\nhad settled in IC were able to\ndeclare at tea with the score\nat 202 for 3.\nAfter tea, Chandra Kulkarni\nachieved the initial breakthrough by taking the first\ntwo wickets. The subsequent\ncollapse was brought about\nby some excellent bowling by\nJohn Gowlett (5 for 26) and\nthe opposition were all out for\n66.\nSuzukis and Kawasaki s. Still\nun f amil. iar with the circuit,\nMartin finished 34th out of 36,\nwith his lap times getting better\neach lap. He also got a Bemsee\nChampionship point for finishing10 th in his class. The race\nwas won by Tom Pemberton on\nhis Kawasaki500. Gets\neverywhere, that one.\nThe second race of Martin's day was also for 1000cc production machines. On his\nsecond lap, he had a\" moment\" on Corams Corner but thought\nit was merely too much power\ntoo early. On his next visit to\nCorams, he found a pile of\nmachines on the side of the\ntrack where the race leaders\nhad discovered the oil Martin\nslid on, Fortunately, no one\nwas badly hurt. Martin finished\nthe race 31st out of 36, having\nhad a dice with 3 Yamahas\nand getting ahead of two of\nthem. We'll be back later for\nthe rest of the field! R.S.L. Wilkes\nSt Johns were forced to fight\nand the result was in question\ntill near the end. Some\nexcellent catches, notably two\ntaken by the wicket keeper John Thombank kept the\npressure on St Johns, however\nnot all chances were taken-They scored the winning runs\nwith three overs of their last\ntwenty remaining. This was a disappointing performance considering the results of the\nmatches of the season. IC Sunday XI v Parkfield II\nAFTER A solid start IC\nscored steadily with\ncontributions from all batsmen\nnotably John Thornback (26).\nThe tail had a last fling and\nthe captain declared at 147 for\n8.\nThe opposition were soon\nstruggling against good\naccurate bowling and Nick Treen guile and pace (?) was\ntoo much for them. However\nthey managed to hold on for a draw at 86 for8. Congratulations\nare due for an excel lent fielding\ndisplay; several good catches were taken and the ground\nfielding was very keen indeed.\nMore SPORT on back page Soccer Mining triumph\nCricket\nNarrow victory\nfor St John's "
