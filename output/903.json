    "content": "An exercise in creative writing by John and Dominic\nBoo Radleys\nFrantically reading the press release on\nthe tube, we cautiously made our way to\nULU to meet the legend that is Boo\nRadleys. Well, maybe not the legend, but\nthey're certainly making a big splash in\nthe paddling pool that is the ever\ngrowing phalanx of noisy melodic post-dinosaur neo-valentine pre-92 guitar\nbands....\nAfter seeing them soundcheck, we met\nthem in the ante-room of the ULU bar.\nAfter ignorant introductions on our part,\nthe conversation dragged round to Every\nHeaven their new ish EP, currently at no.\n1.\nLiverpool scene: real or surreal?\nyeah, its all made up. there are a load of\nbands, its just that they're all crap. The\nLa's are really boring, their FRONT MAN\nLee Mavers was in the PUB on New\nYear's Eve TALKING about STUDIOS.\nBoring! Boring! (And the Farm are ?\nReally drab.) We are a pop band, we\nwant to be on to tp. \"We'll probably get\nour heads kicked in when we go back to\nLiverpool,\" they said.\nLife on tour: well the Boo's aren't too\nenthralled by the word HYGEINE. Hotel\ntrashing?? Well they got kicked out of\ndrummer lives with Dr. Phibes and the\nHouse of Wax Equations (buy the album,\nand the Boo Radleys, they're re eeee ally great.) '89 saw the release of the Boo's debut vinyl offering, on a local Liverpool\nlabel, \"Ichabod and I\"( from a cartoon we\ngather) . A mini album, good old Johnny\nPeel played it and press interest began.\n\"It was the only deal we could get at the\ntime, and small labels can't afford to put\nout singles.\" After the st on king Curve\nsupport set (see next week's interview)the\nphotographer got locked in the dressing\nroom and missed what turned out to be\nGreed. Money. Sex. Power. Drugs. Is\nthe world their oyster? No, they're all\nmade up. We probably haven't sold half\nas many as that. I mean we're ahead of\nthe Inspiral carpets, and there's no way\nwe've sold more than them. It's just\ncertain shops. No we don't get any\nmoney from it. But we do have a15 year\nold who fancies Martin (guitarist).\nWhat were you doing before you were\nin the band? Nothing, but we thought\nabout it for 12 years.\none in Bristol because they got up too\nlate. Hmmmm. In fact most of the places\nthey stay in are B&B. The tour was\ngoing fine until they crashed into The\nPink Toothbrush in Rayleigh which is / is\nnot possibly interesting, so we won't talk\nabout it. Commenting on post-tour\nactivity, we hoped they'd talk about their\ngro opie s( sic) but they don't. They'd rather have a cup of tea and go to bed.\nBands. Groups. Artistes. Dr. Phibes??\nAnyone??\nWell we really like Swervedriver, The\nMC5, and we asked Curve to support us\nand we hate the Farm. Yeah, the\nwhat they described as a good, but not\nmind blowing, gig. We thought it was\ntruly, deeply and chemically great. And\nour minds were blown.\nBack in the dressing room, and reunited\nwith our photographer, we witnessed\nmany stars pass through the portals and\npay homage to the legend that is Boo,\nincluding Chapterhouse, the Pale Saints\nand very nearly Jim and William, but not\nquite.\nDISCLAIMER: this article is loosely\nbased on a true to life interview with the\n\n"

    "content": "IMP' m||g| Obituary\u2014Beverly Halstead\nBeverly Halstead, an academic visitor\nwith the Geology department since 1989,\nwas by profession a geologist and a vertebrate palaeontologist. His black clogs\nand shock of white hair distinguished him\nas no ordinary member of grey academia.\nBev was deeply committed to both his\nstudy and to wider social issues.\nBev was Lancashire born but moved\nwith his mother to Sussex following his\nparents' divorce. His mother's second\nmarriage to a committed Marxist laid the\nfoundations for Bev's early polit cal leanings. He attended Lewes Grammar school and by his early teens was writing\n'Nature Notes ' for the 'Worker'.\nAccording to fellow scientist Colin\nPaterson Bev's mellowing political\nopinions can be traced by the surname's he adopted: first Tarlo, his stepfather's name, then Halstead-Talo and finally\nHalstead.\nBev was someone never afraid to speak\nhis mind; the louder the better. Following\nhis first in Geology at Sheffield he came\nto London and began a PhD at UCL's Zoology Department. He enjoyed what\nPeter Medawar, the then head of\ndepartment describes as the 'Communist',\natmosphere that pervaded the department\nat the time. Bev was not so happy with\nthe academic side and a characteristically\nspectacular row delayed the award of his\ndoctorate.\nBev's career as a research\npalaeontologist began at the Natural\nHistory Museum and later continued in\nthe form of a joint fellowship split\nbetween Oxford and the Royal Dental\nHospital in London. He studied the\nmolecular structure of the skin of a group\nof prehistoric fish and showed it to be\ndirectly comparable with modern day\nmammalian dentition. This explained the\nsensitivity of teeth to certain foods such\nas excessively sweet ones; the natural\nenvironment for teeth is saline water.\nThis research and its conclusion reflected\nBev's, considerable powers of lateral\nthinking.\nHe joined Reading's zoology and\ngeology departments in 1963 and became\na reader in 1968. By the early 1970s Bev's sights were set outside of the\nBritish academic scene and he spent\nthree years at Ife, Nigeria, as professor of\nzoology, followed by a six month period\nat Panjab Unirersity, Chandigarth, India.\nBack at home Bev became increasingly\nfamiliar to a wider audience with the\npublication of his very accessible books\non dinosaurs. Bev also gained public\nrecognition as a person unafraid to\nchallenge the foremost scientists and\nscientific institutions of the day. In 1980\nhis battle with the Natural History\nMuseum over the 'cladistics' question\nbegan. Bev was incensed that the\nmuseum had used cladistics (essentially\ndic hoto mus branching diagrams) as a didactic aid, and thereby lending support\nto episodic evolutionary theories. The\nargument was furious but the result was\nvictor o us. The museum eventually\nremoved the offending exhibit .\nDespite these brushes with the\nestablishment , or indeed because of\nthem, Bev was held in the highest regard\nby his colleagues. He was this year's President of the Geology section of the\nBA and also the current president of the\nGeologist's Association. For a person so\nhonoured by his profession Bev was\nremarkable in his low-key friendly nature.\nIn lecture breaks and after them he was\nchatty and relaxed, immensely\nin tere set ed in us, the students. He\nconcluded the last lecture of the Easter\nterm by saying that his work was done\nand that the future, in every way , lay\nwith us. Bev was the most inspiring\nperson I have ever met. I miss him.\nLambert Beverly Halstead (Tarlo),\ngeologist and palaeontologist,\nborn Pendleton Lancashire 13 June 1933,\nReader in Geology and Zoology Reading\nUniversity 1968-91, married 1975 Jennifer\nMiddleton (one son), died near Bath 30\nApril 1991.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "A Week for Life\nNext week is Christian Aid Week. On\nMonday, members of the West London\nChaplaincy will be collecting around\ncollege on behalf of Christian Aid; but just\nwhere will the money go when it comes\nout of the tin again? What, in short, is all\nthe fuss about?\n'I'm not giving money if...'\nWhen we were collecting last year, a few\npeople refused to donate any money\nbecause 'it would only be used to fund\nmissionary work'. They didn't want their\nmoney being used to spread the Christian\nfaith. Fair enough. It would have been\nbetter if they'd waited for an answer\nthough, because Christian Aid isn'ta missionary society, it's an aid charity.\nJust like any other\nLike the other major aid organisations\n(Oxfam, Cafod and similar groups)\nChristain Aid is concerned with many\ndifferent projects in many countries. Long\nterm projects to help communities\nimprove their living standards reflect the\nChristian belief that all people have a right to basic living standards, whilst\nrapid response to emergency situations is\nalso a major concern. Christian Aid has\nalso been part of this year's campaign\nagainst the third world debt crisis,\nreflecting the degree to which the\ndeveloped world is responsible for the\ncontinued problems facing developing\ncountries.\nLife before death\nFrom 13th to 18th May around 400,000\ncollectors will be at work in Britain,\naiming to beat last year's record six and\na half million pound total. There's no\ndoubt that the money is needed. To date,\ndespite the massive aid programme for\nKurdish refugees, Britain has provided no\nnew aid money. This means that the\nmoney being spent on aid for Kurds in\nTurkey and Iran won't be available for\nuse in the famine already hitting Africa.\nChristian Aid alone estimates that it needs\nto raise a further 1.5 million just to pay\nfor essential food for Eritrea: it has\nalready donated 2.8 million since\nJanuary. It is hoped that this will in turn\npersuade European governments to fund\na further 750,000 tonnes of aid (about\nS750 million worth).\nThe magnitude of the figures is\nappalling. Yet this money is merely to\nstave off starvation; it can do no long-term good. Christian Aid and the other\naid charities try whenever possible to use\nmoney for longer term development\nprojects and education in order to give\nthe maximum return to all the money\nused. People are encouraged to learn\nskills which enable them to work for their\nown food rather than to depend on first\nworld handouts, water supplies are made\n\u2022 Hi W safe and reliable, education is a prime\nconcern. In Bolivia, Christian Aid works\nalongside a national organisation of mine\nworkers' cooperatives, helping their\nmembers acquire skills essential to the\nrunning of the cooperatives. At the same\ntime, mothers are taught how to mix\ndrinks of water, sugar and salt to prevent\ndeath from diarrhoea or dehydration.\nThere is a school for children who would\notherwise be beggars, where they can\nlearn marketable skills.\nAll this, however, isn't even the top of\nthe iceberg. As Larry Boyd of Christian\nAid says, 'it can be very difficult for\nChristian Aid to dec ei de which projects to\nsupport. There are so many good ones\nand such great needs that charities alone\ncannot come close to covering them all'.\nChristian Aid's response is two fold: to\nlisten to local advice on which projects\nare of most help and also to seek to\nchange major world economic factors\nwhich hinder third world development.\nThis year's campaign to encourage banks\nto write off more third world debts and\nrelieve countries like Bolivia of the\ncrippling interest burdens has been a fruit\nof such a process.\nThere must be more\nThere should be more to human life than\nan endless struggle for survival, yet the\nhard work of the poor of the third world\nwho try to better their lives can only pay\noff if the developed world is willing to\nhelp the process. Christian Aid can go a small way towards that aim. Please, be\ngenerous in your contributions on\nMonday. If you wish, write to your MP\nasking them to encourage higher\ngovernment spending on aid and disaster\nrelief.\nAndy Cooksley\n(West London Chaplaincy)\n'The street child has no one and sees\neveryone as an enemy', says Augustin\nGarcia, who lived on the streets for two\nyears before taking refuge at Colonia\nPirai when it started in 1972. Today he is\na teacher at Colonia Pirai, helping to\ntrain former street children to earn a living from skilled trades.\nIt can be very difficult for Christian Aid\nto decide which programmes to support.\nThere are so many good ones and such\ngreat needs that charities alone cannot\ncome close to covering them all.\nFor this reason Christian Aid listens to\nthe groups it is able to support to learn\nwhat can be done in Britain and Ireland\nto change the economic relations\nbetween the rich countries and the Third\nWorld that keep people poor.\nBolivian groups point out that their\ncountry has been using a large\npercentage of its earnings from exports to\npay back loans taken out before the tin\nmarket crashed and interest rates soared.\nIt is a pattern repeated in many other\ncountries, and why Christian Aid started\nits Banking on the Poor campaign, urging\ndebt relief for poor nations.\nWhen people work as hard as they do\nin Bolivia, they deserve a chance to live.\nLarry Boyd.\n12\n\n"

    "content": "MLSIC\nJohnathan\nRichman\n\u2014Subterania 30.4.91\nWith a yee-hah, my stetson and a pineapple in my hand (true! true!) 1\nstumbled around Ladbroke Grove trying\nto find Subterania and see a very cool\ndude indeed. First came the support band\nThe Rockin' Birds who played a mighty\nfine smokin' set of country-rock sounding\nlike the very cool Flying Burrito Brothers\nand the even cooler Big Star. Gradually\nstarted off just like something from Big\nStar's first album before the slide guitar\npicked up and plugged in. They even had\nthe audacity to sing a song called\nJonathan in homage to the man himself.\nHeh-heh, pretty cool. And they covered\nAlex Chilton's Free Again. Even cooler.\nBut where is Jonathan? 1 am returning\nfrom the very nice but very\nclaustrophobic bar when he takes the\nstage so it takes a little time to get back\ndown the front. At last I get there and\nsee Jonathan with just an amp and his\nFender strapped around his torso. At\nonce he is laughing, telling jokes to the\naudience and trying to get the bass\nfeedback out of his amp. Last year\nJonathan Richman went country and this\ntime he seems to have gone 50s rock 'n' roll doing his duck-walk and wiggling his\nhips. This man is a major dude. When\nfronting The Modern Lovers in the mid-late 70s he gave us the third best album\never made. Ever-ever.\nWhen he plays a bum note he does it\nagain making out it's part of the song. He\nsings a song in Italian after treating us to\nsome of his newly learnt language. He\nsings 'What once was a puppy is now a dog, and what was once a piglet is now a hog'. Beat that Jim fuck witt Kerr. He\nsings a song about when he was seven\nwalking home and hearing the ice-cream\ntruck and how he dug its little musical\nbell and how he'd buy an ice and just\nhang out at the van until it drove away.\nHell, he didn't take an intermission and\nhe played for nearly two hours. And then\nhe took his guitar, his jacket and his bag\nand left. The lights came on and I legged\nit to the gents. Too much tea y 'see.\nDominic.\nPaul Leary\nEnya meets REM with a bit of Kramer\nand the swans added for spice. This is a classic. If the dog on the front doesn't grab you then the connections with the\nbutt holes should (Paul Leary is a butt hole surfer the sticker on the front of the\nalbum proudly announces).\nThe dreamy spl iff sounding vocals and\nthe distinct lack of chords are great but\nthe best thing is the musical variation-each song is different.\nWith Buttholes dancy beats and semi-falsetto vocals prove a selling point when\nthe repetitive guitar sound (which is on\nthe whole acoustic) depresses. But it is\nthe injection of almost indie pop-hardcore\nsongs which inject life into the record.\nLevity, if it could be described as that,\nis added by the deep organ sound and\nthe butt hole orientated guitar wan king. However this is not just another Butthole\nSurfers spinoff. Despite it's undeniable\nroots, influences seem to range from post-punk to fairground ditties with almost\nfunky variations on a sometimes gothic\ntheme.\n\u2014The History of Dogs LP\nAll the conventional sounds of hippy\nbased rock-n roll waste are incorporated\nwith a wit of wacky ness. Considering the\nentire album is the work of one man's, admittedly fairly warped, brain the end\nresult is original and very likeable.\nSeb.\nTheatre of Hate\n-Westworld LP\nYo! Yul Bryner is cool. My good friend\nSean was round at my place when 1\ndecided to review this artefact and\nwarned me beforehand that 'apart from\nthe first song, which is half decent, the\nalbum is not good'. Well I 've got an open\nmind and all that but my friend Sean is\nright. The album is not good. This is not\nto say it is all total bollocks. No sir eee, one song is even nearly decent. Tucked\naway on side two is The New Trails of\nTears which starts with a haunting choir\nmixed down low and its Spanish spoken\nintro.\nThematically the band must have been\nheavily into spaghetti westerns and all\nthat outlaw stuff, as that twang y guitar so\nbeloved of those films is found\nthroughout the album. Kirk Brandon\nhadn't yet learnt to sing too well and the\nrhythm is suitably sparse throughout with\nKirk's dark and dank vocals creating a mood of tension and depression.\nWe decided Freaks to be the worst\nsong on the album with semi-free-form-sax and some very, very dod gy prog-rock\nbits which sounded like something from\nYes in 1975. Now, the KLF have style.\nDid you see them on Top of the Pops last\nweek? That's showbiz. Anywaysayowsa\nback to this record. Only buy it if you're\na Spanish post-punk proto-miser ab list cowboy or y 'dig brooding in your room\nlistening to The Smiths and want\nsomething a bit harder but still retaining\nthe dark words. (Note: Errr, the songs\naren't as good though and y 'still gotta be\na cowboy, right!). The record had the last\nlaugh making me spill my tea as I tried to\ntake the darned thing off my record\nplayer. Whilst mopping up some tea\nwhich had landed on my Yul Bryner\nvideo collection I noticed a Yul film\ncalled Westworld. How bizzar e! Dominic.\n10\n\n"

The\nact consists of transvestites and a single\nwoman. At the end, as the audience\napplauded vigorously for an encore, one\nmale student exhibited his intolerant\nhatred by shouting out 'bloody poofs'.\nTheir act is a wonderful celebration of\nlife and sexuality. The club they work in\nevery night, Madame Jo Jo's, is a rare\nplace in this society where you can\nescape the inhuman culture of the macho\nmale.\nThe day that the Americans bombed\nLibya I was at the theatre watching the\nplay 'The Normal Heart', featuring the\nAmerican actor, Martin Sheen. After the\nfinal curtain he spoke to the audience,\ndelivering a speech condemning his\ncountry's actions. How many of us\nremain silent when confronted with\ninjustice, because we would feel\nembarrassed to cause 'unnecessary'\ntrouble? Did anyone confront the\nshouting student that night?\n'The Normal Heart' is about the gay\ncommunity facing AIDS in America. It\nexamines the internal politics of the\ncommunity facing official indifference to\nthe rising death toll. Its main character\nrefuses to be defined by the sexual act of\nbugger y, instead fighting for the\nrecognition of the culture produced by\ngay people. Why is their sexuality\nignored in the textbooks?\nOne of the many famous gay people he\nlists is Alan Turing, the scientist who\ncreated the concept of the 'Turing\nMachine', and whose decoding of the\nNazi's Enigma Code was considered a major contribution to our success in the\nSecond World War. He was openly gay,\nlost his security clearance after the war,\nwas forced to undergo hormone\ntreatment to 'normal is e' his behaviour,\nand finally committed suicide.\n'I can never allow this play to be\nperformed in any form. It's production is\nabsolutely refused. It is a play that says\nEgyptians are homosexuals. This is\nsomething I refuse to permit on stage.'\nThis was the response of the theatre\ncensor in Cairo when asked by Karim\nAlrawi why his new play, 'Crossing the\nWater', had been banned. In it he\nportrays the relationships between seven\npeople leading up to and during the Suez\nCrisis.

His flirtatious wife falling in love\nwith her husband's gay lover, a young\nEgyptian poet. The wife also discovering\nthat her adored, late father, raped and\ncontinually abused a thirteen year old\nEgyptian girl, with the support of an\nEgyptian friend. The girl being murdered\nby her own family to rid themselves of\nthe shame. The corruption of colonial\nownership and arrogance, the lost hope\nof the English as they watch the RAF\nbomb Alexandria Harbour.

The ICA is situated on the Mall, the\nroad running from Buckingham Palace to\nTrafalgar Square.\nStarving in\nSilence\nOne of the largest famines of modern\ntimes occurred in China between 1959\nand 1961. At least 14 million lives were\nlost, the population of China actually\ndropping. Yet in 1989 a BBC journalist\nwas told these years had had bumper\ncrops. Even people who had lost their\nentire families spoke, not of famine, but\nsan ni an kun an', or 'three difficult years'.\nARTICLE 19, in their report on famine\nand censorship called 'Starving in Silence',\ndocument the censorship and\nmisinformation behind the China famine,\nas well as those in Sudan and Ethiopia.\nTo promote the effectiveness of their\nagricultural revolution Chairman Mao's China encouraged the active exaggeration\nof estimates of crop yields. During the\nyears that yields were claimed to be\nincreasing in great bounds, the real\nsituation was of growing starvation due to\nrecurrent droughts and the continued\nexport of foods to the Soviet Union. This\nwas compounded through lack of aid due\nto censorship internally and\ninternationally. Peng Dehuai, Red Army\nfounder, Long March veteran and Korean\nWar Hero died in 1974 after years of\nimprisonment and violent interrogation\ndue to his attempts to make Mao aware\nof the exaggerated yield reports and the\nfamine. He was not alone.\n'They did fuck all.Sir.' Colonel Hugh\nMackay, Overseas Director of Save the\nChildren Fund responding to a question\nby Sir Anthony Kershaw during a Foreign\nAffairs Committee meeting to find out\nwhy the British government had been\nkept in the dark about the famine in\nEthiopia that lasted from 1982-85. Colonel\nMackay was explaining the disbelief of\nembassy officials to reports of\napproaching famine by Oxfam and Save\nthe Children. Examining this cynicism,\nthe control of information by the\nEthiopian government, the definition of\nnews by our own media, the censorship\nby the aid organisations in respect of the\nforced re settlement imposed by the\ngovernment killing at least 100,000 more\npeople and of the political causes of the\nfamine, it exposes the true killing nature\nof censorship.\nIf you feel there is no way that your\ncries of help can be heard, your attempt\nto protest at encroaching hunger and\nstarvation will be stifled by the apathy of\nhopelessness. You will starve in silence.\nThis book is an outstanding contribution\nto the debate on the causes of famine. It\nis unique in the issues that it raises,\nexplaining why they have not be raised\nby the organisations most involved in the\nfamines covered.\n6\nFinal Chapter\nHypocrisy over Porn! ri\n.\\L> FEATURES\nAs part of Channel 4's 'Banned' Season\nthere was a programme 'Signals; DV8\nPhysical Theatre' that used dance and\ntalking heads to examine the issue of\nhomosexuality and Clause 28. The last\nhalf was presented by a gay teacher. He\nsat in an enormous arm- chair, beside\nhim sat an old man. He told the story of\nhis childhood and his father's love. The\nlove for a son that required no\nconditions. The old man watched him as\nhe spoke, he was the father.\nHis plea for his humanity, whilst his\nlover's head rested on his lap, asked us to\nimagine that the person we love was\nhurt, was insulted, was beaten. He did\nnot express hatred, just that we should\nunderstand the pain of being threatened\nbecause of who you love. How can so\nmuch hatred be expressed against people\nfor their love, against people who do not\nthreaten, who do not insult? It was a beautifully powerful defence of the\nhuman rights and dignity of homosexuals,\nsomething that is illegal to show where it\nis most needed, in our schools. Ours is a society where the effeminate child is\nbullied, and often blamed by teachers for\nbeing a victim. Where gays are beaten to\ndeath by young men to express their own\nperverted sense of manhood. Where\nbeing aggressive and hard is seen as\nexciting and good compared to those who\nare compassionate and care.\nThe anti-wimp, pro-macho society is\none that rests on intolerance, preferring\nthe rule of violence to that of justice.\nOnly four years ago, at IC, the macho\nculture of the Royal School of Mines was\nchallenged. Indeed it had been fo ug ty against for more than a period of four\nyears. They had a Union Officer called\n'Hon Pornographer', who would read bad\nand obscene poetry at their UGMs. Then\nonce a year he would organise, for\n'Foreign Student's Week', an evening of\npornographic entertainment. The films\nincluded bestiality, sado-masochism,\ndegrading images of men and women. It\nwas an annual ritual celebration of the\nRSMUs attitude to manhood, one\nsummed-up by hard drinking and fucking.\nAs a Union event it relied upon the\nsupport of the students at Imperial\nCollege, who were thereby supporting,\nand profiting from, the portrayal of\nwomen as sexual organs to be used and\nabused by men and animals.\nThe campaign against 'Hon Porn Night'\nled to a response, in its defence, that\nexpressed the inhumanity of the event.\nThe RSMU resorted to lies and personal\ninsults, creating an atmosphere in which\nwomen were afraid to stand-up at a UGM\nto speak. Rather than debating the nature\nof the image of women, and men, that\nthe Union was promoting, they hid\nbehind a smoke screen of freedom. Those\nvery people who censored through fear\nclaimed to be fighters against censorship.\nThey had lost the debate from the start.\nThey avoided the issues, used standing\norders to try to prevent debate, lied\nabout the nature of the event, even relied\nupon bribes of free beer to get supporters\nto the UGMs. The saddest part of the\nfight was the lack of understanding about\nthe nature of Union representation and democracy. In a country that relies upon\ndemocracy as the form of government it\nis rather ironic that its science and\nengineering students failed to grasp that\nthe nature of events organised in its\nname, in its building, with its equipment\nand money, represent attitudes and\nimages that it finds acceptable. Our\nUnion, assisting in the staging of this\nevent, supported the use of these images\nas a form of entertainment. Images that\ninsulted sexuality, that corrupted the\nhumanity of women into play objects for\nmen.\n\u2022 \u2022 \" ' \u2022 - till* During the fight I was called a hypocrite, amongst many other names, as\nI admitted to enjoying pornography. I have been called this again, by those who\nknow about my undergraduate\ncampaigning activities, due to my\norganisation of 'To Boldly Go'. By\nshowing 'Dick' and 'Visions of Ecstasy' I have been accused of showing\npornography. The irony is that the events\nwere an intellectual examination of the\nfilms, one of which, 'Dick'; actually\nchallenges, using wonderful humour, the\nmacho image of the male supported by\n'Hon Porn Night'. 'Dick' is a celebration\nof our humanity.\nI wonder if our college has changed\nover the passed four years to join in that\ncelebration and reject its inhuman past.\nOr has it just grown silent simply due to\nthe pressure of work and exams, the\nsilence being mistaken for tolerance, the\nlack of caring being mistaken for mutual\nrespect, the lack of debate for the\navoidance of trivial politics. Censorship is\na vital issue here, so vital because most\nof us will have exercised the personal\ncensorship of not giving a damn.

    "content": "Robin Hood\nHIn the summer of 1989, Paramount\npictures presented the final\ninstalment of the Indiana Jones\ntrilogy, and since then Hollywood has\nbeen searching for a suitable hero to fill\nthe gap left in the action/adventure\nmovie market.\nHollywood it seems, feels that the\nsolution is Robin Hood, as this year will\nsee not one but two Robin Hood movies.\nThis summer we can expect to see Robin\nHood\u2014The Prince of Thieves, which stars\nthat man of the moment\u2014Kevin Costner.\nHowever, at present we have John\nIrvin's simply entitled and very enjoyable\nRobin Hood.\nThe movie stars Irish actor Patrick\nBergin in the title role, (he can currently\nbe seen as Julia Roberts' sadistic husband\nin Sleeping with the Enemy). Alongside\nhim are a fine supporting cast, most\nnotably Uma Thurman as Maid Marian.\nVisually the movie is a treat, the\nMedieval period being portrayed on\nscreen accurately with the feel of the\nMiddle Ages being created from the very\nfirst moment, with sinister shots of a misty, murky Sherwood Forest.\nWith this bleak backdrop in mind it is a pleasant surprise to find the story an\nenlivening one. This Robin Hood is not\nthe malevolent, supernatural tale as\npresented in the popular TV series but\ninstead it owes much to the tone of the\n1938 Errol Flynn version. Irvin's Robin\nHood is played in a lighthearted tone,\nwhich at times is almost tongue-in-cheek.\nNearly everyone knows something\nabout Robin Hood, and director Irvin has\nkept this in mind, presenting a movie that\ncovers all the aspects of the Robin Hood\nlegend whilst neatly injecting the story\nwith some nice touches of humour.\nThe only fault with the movie is that\nthe familiarity of the story causes a lack\nof any real excitement. Nevertheless, the\naction sequences are very well staged,\neverything looks terrific, and despite one\nor two nasty moments, it's all good clean\nfun.\nUma Thurman plays Maid Marian as a headstrong, tough young woman which\nmakes a nice change. Bergin plays Robin\nHood as the champion of the people to\ngood effect, and all the supporting cast\n(especially a memorable cameo from\nEdward Fox as King John) are\nmarvellous.\nRobin Hood is an enjoyable movie\nbecause it doesn't take itself too seriously\nand is really played for laughs, and\nalthough it's not 'edge of the seat' type\nstuff.\nIt's still a good evening's entertainment.\nThe Don.\nBallad of Sad Cafe\nBB M Special films take the viewer and\n\" I make them feel part of the action;\nthe Ballad of Sad Cafe does this and\nmore.\nSet in the deep south of America. Full\nof swamps, heat, poor blacks picking\ncotton and the poor living under tin\nroofs. In the midst of this Miss Amelia\n(Vanessa Redgrave) runs the general store\nand local still, thus controls the whole\nvillage. Half sane, vicious and cruel,\neveryone respects her and no one cares\nfor her. Until that is into the hard\nwilderness comes cousin Lymon (Cork\nHubbert). A humpback dwarf claiming to\nbe 'kin' to Miss Amelia. Much to the\nsurprise of everyone, she takes him in\nand cares for him. Lymon rearranges\nAmelia, dresses her up, turns her drinking\nhovel into a cafe and enlivens the village\nwith his boasts and antics.\nAll is going well until Miss Amelia's husband returns from the state\npenitentiary. Marvin Macy (Keith\nCarridine) is a handsome, dangerous\nrebel; his only hope was love for Miss...\nAmelia. She married him, took his land\nand never let him back into her house.\nTwisted by this rejection he returns now\nto seek his revenge.\nInstead of jealousy Lymon idol is es Macy, seeing Macy as everything he\ncannot be. This makes Lymon the\ncatalyst which brings tragedy to the small\nvillage.\nWhat raises this film from a simple\nstudy of relationships is the feel of it. The\nmain scenes are played in front of other\nvillagers, you can always hear the gossipy\ncomments which become part of the\nunfolding drama.\nThe simplistic, bare nature of the\nvillage is communicated in human gesture\nand expression, not speech, which is\nminimal and crude. The backdrop of\ncotton fields and murky swamps is\ndevastating. As is the feel of poverty and\ncommunity in the village. Each character,\nalthough sometimes incredible, is vivid\nand powerful.\nWhy Amelia rejects Macy is never\nmade clear, adding a plot hiccup which is\nquickly overcome by the mood. More\ndisturbing is the acceptance of white\nsuperiority; this was clearly the case in\nsouthern America but a sensitive film like\nthis, I feel, cannot pass over the issue as\na background detail.\nThis is a beautiful and sincere film: its\ntrue impact takes time to appreciate.\nInitially it appears naive and innocent.\nGiven full development Simon Callow's first film as a director easily reaches the\nmythical proportions it aspires to.\nJonty.\nMr. Johnson\nHAfrica conjures up many images\ntoday, but none are appropriate for\nthe Africa of the 1920's when\nNigeria was part of the British Empire\nand Colonial Service was natural for an\nupwardly mobile young man. Set in this\nera, the film concerns the life of a young\nNigerian, Mister Johnson, who believes\nthat England is his true home.\nJohnson travels through various jobs\nduring the film, starting as an accountant,\nlooking after the finances for a new road\nto be built across the district and passing\nthrough more lowly jobs before coming\nfull circle to the road again. He is the\nfilm's villain as well as it's hero, however,\nand his eventual demise comes as no\nsurprise.\nThis is not, however, just a chronicle of\na man's life, his rise and fall, but a montage of feelings from that passage of\nNigeria's past where England pushed the\ncountry into commercialism. It charts the\nnatives' feelings of intrusion and\nacceptance of the new road and inspires\nthe heart with the beauty of the\nlandscape. A wonderfully stirring film.\nFred Bloggs\nOf - Film5 "

    "content": "Canoeing\nAfter finishing last term with a successful\nsurfing trip to Scrunge in Wales, on the\nfirst day of the vacation the canoe club\nset off for its second, traditional, Easter\ntour to Scotland\u2014a small country in the\nNorth of England.\nOn the Saturday night, after a twelve\nhour drive, both vehicles miraculously\narrived at our first week's accommodation\nin Invermoriston, on the edge of Loch\nNess.\nAfter a good night's sleep, we set off on\na gentle warm-up paddle to the river\nSpey. Over the first few days the troops\nprog esse d in difficulty, allowing the\nnovices present to build up their\nconfidence and also take advantage of\nnumerous swimming opportunities. The\npaddling was good, but unfortunately our\nchoice of rivers was limited as, unusually\nfor Scotland, there was no bloody water!\nAfter a sightseeing trip to Skye, we\nthen moved our base South West to Loch\nAwe\u2014an area containing a number of\nmeaty rivers. Needless to say that by this\ntime we were praying for rain and\namazingly our prayers were answered;\nunfortunately whoever was listening was\njust a tad over zealous, and all the rivers\nrose about five feet overnight, and most\nwere deemed unsafe to paddle for the\nrest of the week. We therefore had to\nreassess the situation, and most of us\nwere limited to a day trip on the Loch\nand also to paddling a one mile stretch of\nthe river Orchy\u2014just for the sake of it.\nSome of the more experienced paddlers\ndecided to risk life and limb on some of\nthe 'safer' raging torrents.\nDespite the disappointing conditions,\neveryone enjoyed the trip, and plans are\nafoot for next year's tour\u2014possible to the\nArdeche.\nMeanwhile we regularly go on weekend\ntrips to such places as Wales and Devon;\nanyone who would like to give canoeing\na try is welcome to come along to an\nintroductory pool ses son on a Tuesday\nevening.\nSnooker\nOver the Easter recess, someone broke\ninto the Snooker room and took 2 and a half sets of snooker balls. For this reason,\nthe Snooker club has been unable to.,\nopen as usual. So if anyone out there\nknows anything about the theft please get\nin touch with any member of the Snooker\nCommittee. If the thief himself were to\nreturn the balls, it would be greatly\nappreciated, and no further action will be\nconsidered.\nBoat Club\nLast Friday, the Boat Club's First Eight\nrepresented the College at Henley\nRegatta in Japan, racing against for teen other University crews. Over 1,600\nmetres of the Sumida River in Tokyo. IC\ndominated the first heat of the\ncompetition, finishing well clear of the\nfield, which included Melbourne\nUniversity. The final was an epic one; IC\nwere led off the start, but rowed through\nthe opposition to win by nine seconds.\nNippon University were runners-up,\nDurham University a close third, with\nWaseda University from Tokyo fourth.\nThe result came as a huge relief to the\ncrew, who had overcome an eight hour\ntime difference, difficulties in rigging a borrowed boat, a strong headwind and a very rough river. The racing was shown\nlive on Japanese TV and the crew\nacquired celebrity status in the eyes of a large crowd. Japan was suitably\nimpressed by the professionalism of\nImperial College Boat Club.\nUAU Cricket\nUCL vs IC Saturday 4th May\n1st XI\nIC lost by 1 run\nAfter a delayed start due to a wet pitch,\nIC put UCL in to bat having won the toss.\nThanks to some excellent bowling by\nJohn Mottashed, who took 6 wickets, UCL\nwere bowled out shortly after lunch for\n133.\nImperial started badly, and slumped to\n50-5 by tea. After tea, IC captain, Mike\nAnderson, set about rescuing the position\nwith typical gritty determination. He was\nfinally out lb w having scored 43 runs and\nhaving been dropped at least 3 times. It\nwas left to the last two batsmen to try to\nscore the winning runs. Unfortunately\nafter a nail biting finish, IC were all out\nfor 132, which severely reduces the\nchances of the 1st XI's chances of going\nthrough to the next round.\n2nd XI\nIC win by 8 wickets\nOnce again IC won the toss and put UCL\nin. After under twenty overs UCL were\nall back in the pavilion having just scored\n29 runs. This rout was mainly due to Rup\nRanerjee, who took five wickets including\naha trick finishing with figures of 9-3-11-5,\nand being ably supported by Steve\nEverton.\nIC quickly scored the runs to win, with\nGunni Dhahyalla scoring 22 n.o. A beer\nmatch was them hastily organised due to\nthe match finishing so quickly. UCL were\nsadly thrashed again. \"It's like taking\ncandy from children\" observed one\numpire!\nCUBS Ents\nIt's getting to that time of the year when\nmost students have only one thing on\ntheir minds...How are those Ents kids\ngoing to continue to provide top-quality\nentertainment with the pressures of\nexaminations lying heavy upon their\nweary shoulders?

This was due to me having\nan exam at the end of the first week of\nterm, and last week the paper suppliers\ndidn't. This week Felix is creeping back up\nto the 20 pages I had planned as a regular\nsize for this term, and only missed it\nbecause of the Bank Holiday. I apologise\nfor the smaller sizes, but what with exams\nand circumstances beyond my control,\nwe're having to work on a very week-by-week basis.\nHere we go. Again.\nSpeaking of week-by-week, that seems to\nbe the way the Rector works as well.\nOne week he seems to have got the\nmessage that virtually no-one wants the\nCollege day to be extended by starting at\na silly time and finishing at a silly time,\nand that the proposal just isn't justifiable,\nand the next week he's decided to ignore\nall that, and try to go ahead with it\nanyway.\nSo, I'm afraid that we may have to go\nthrough the whole farcical scenario again.\nSo for your own sake s, and those of any\nfuture students at IC, if another EGM or\nsurvey is called, get involved and stop\nHis Rectorness from running rampant\nthrough the structure of our college, and\nshow him that he can't just change\nanything he wants just because he wants\nto. Even if he really really wants to.\nMoney, Money, Money...\nAt about this time of year some of the\nGreater Gods of College use their near\ninfinite wisdom to decide on next years\nrents for college accommodation. Of\ncourse, as they haven't officially released\nthem yet we'll all have to wait until next\nweek to see what they're going to be.\nHowever, as they've been steadily going\nup for at least the last two years, it seems\nlikely that this trend could continue,\nespecially when you consider that the\naccommodation sector of college has\ndebts amounting to around \u00a320.5 million,\nand it seems that they expect the\nstudents to pay this off. That seems fair\nto me. After all, the Estates Director,\nGordon Marshall, refused to make any\ncomment about the possibility that bad\nmanagement was to blame for the debt,\nand said that the purchase of the\nClayponds site was a 'very good move',\ndespite the fact that it, combined with the\noverall bungling of the Montpelier sale, is\ndirectly responsible for a large proportion\nof this debt. And he must be right. Of\ncourse, I could be wrong, and rents might\njust go up by the 10.5% called for by\ninflation. Anyone want to give me some\nodds?\n\u2022\nStaff Meeting:\nMonday 1pm.

    "content": "Scenes From a Mall\nHmm... a Woody Allen movie.\nOoh.. it also features Bette Midler.\nWow.\n1 am not, alas, in the happy majority\nthat finds either Allen or Midler funny. To\nhave the two of them in the same movie\nis almost embarrassing.\nWoody and Bette are a pair of yuppies\nwho gush with abandon about being\nglobe-trotting hippies in their long-gone\nyouth (ie. before I was born) and how\namazing they are now that they're both\nsuccessful and unique, in that their\nlengthy marriage has survived sixteen\nyears. They pack the kids off on a skiing\nvacation, romantic is e wistfully and go\nshopping.\nOnce shopping, Woody reveals that he's been having an affair. Bette gets angry.\nWoody is contrite. This goes on for a very long time. This is pretty dull.\nThey make up. They break up. They\nhave an argument and agree to get a divorce... this all goes on for far too long\nand is still not very interesting. Together\nthey rush around the mall reminiscing,\nneuro sing and lach rym o sing and in the\ncourse of doing so boring me to nervous\nexhaustion. Midler shrieks and grates,\nWoody humbles and scrapes (incidentally,\nthis isn't really one of his films, the\ndirector is someone else) and the film\nlumbers on. To an end which is\nsimultaneously sickeningly sweet and\ncompletely inconsequential.\nThis is a film which, from a subjective\npoint of view, fails completely because: a)1 am not old enough to remember any of\nthe points of reference involved b)1 don't live in Los Angeles c)I am not neurotic\nand d)I am not married.\nIf you fit in one or more of these\ncategories, don't see this film.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nPerfectly Normal\nRenzo Parachi is perfectly normal\nin every way. After his mother dies\nhe goes into a strict routine\nconsisting of getting up, going to work at\nthe brewery, playing ice hockey for the\nwork's team, and then driving his late\nfather's cab at night for extra cash. This\nloops daily into regular monotony until\nhe picks up Turner (Robbie Coltrane) who\nafter a full evening's drinking ends up as\nRenzo's lodger. Turner is all that Renzo\nisn't, with a love of wine, women and\nItalian cuisine. However they both share\na love of opera and from this (and the\na quis it ion of a tidy wad of spun doo lig s) they must solve the dilemma of whose\ndream to follow; Renzo's, which is to\nbuild a little house on his plot of land, or\nTurner's, which is to open a theme Italian\nrestaurant where all the waiters dress as\ncharacters from La Traviata and the\nfloor show has an unusual highlight. With\nextra subplots of a girl who lusts after\nRenzo, a work mate whose hatred of\nRenzo tends on the psychopathic and the\nvarious hockey games against rivals\nEastern Clay whom the Titans (our team)\nhave never beaten, this bizarre look at\nlife builds into a compelling story with\nplenty of goals for a dull guy to reach.\nSave for Robbie Coltrane the cast are\nunknown and all give good performances,\nwith Michael Riley as Renzo portraying a character who has serenity rather than\npathos and drifts through life almost\nunaffected by the goings on around him.\nIt's nice to see prospective girlfriend\nDenise (Deborah Duchene) going after\nRenzo rather than Hunk McChunk out to\ngrab helpless to t tie, and team coach\n(Kenneth Welsh) was born to wear a lumberjack shirt and baseball cap.\nDirector Yves Simoneau uses some\nstunning scenes with puck's eye view\nhockey games, thirty second bursts-of\ntaxi passengers and powerful shots of\nRenzo's mother's planned death (?) and\nhis initial shock all set to an operatic\nscore. The film is a delight and really gets\nall the emotions into overdrive in the big\nfinish. If you liked 'After Hours' you'll\nlove this, only more so.\nThe Amazing Machine.\nFreedom is\nHSasha is a juvenile delinquent who\nescapes regularly from the\npenitentiary. The only reason he\nseems to have for this is that he wishes\nto remain free. His mother is dead, and\nhe knows nothing of his father, save that\nthe latter is alive; no one will tell him\nmore.\nHis desire to know more is brought to\nthe surface of the film when, upon his\nlatest recapture, he is told that his father\nhas written to the prison, asking for a document about his son. The boy\nmanages to sneak a look at the envelope:\nhis father is serving a sentence in a prison in the Far North. Once more,\nParadise\nSacha escapes, his objective being to\nmeet his father.\nLife, as seen through the eyes of a youngster. An approach we are well-acquainted with, through Hope and Glory,\nand My Life as a Dog. The setting is\ndifferent; a hazardous journey through a squalid world still trying to come to terms\nwith glasnost. But the boy, sullen with his\ncaptors, always a rebel, still sees the\nbeautiful side of his world. Hope is within\nhim, as he learns, and always wins out,\ndespite outbreaks of despair when his\nwishes are thwarted; indeed, as the\ntattooed initials (SER) on his hand imply,\nfreedom is paradise.\nSacha is the focus of the film, and the\ndirector Sergei Bodrov's efforts to express\nthe film through him have paid off well,\ndown to the gain y film used to imply\ndespair. Volodya Kozyrev plays the boy\nwith dignity: sulky, aloof, ruthless if need\nbe, yet with a heart of gold. Glasnost's effects show up here and there; the Nike\nt shirts, the nudity. Humour is present,\nsometimes through sheer pathos.\nCertainly worth seeing, especially if\nyou're into this sort of film. Bodrov is a talent to keep track of in the future.\nZia Akbar.\n4\n\n"

    "content": "Scribblers' Corner\nDoppelgangers, Rock and Bitching\nDear Andy,\nFurther to BJ's letter of FELIX 900\n(some time ago, but then undergrads\nhave holidays to counterbalance the\nnausea of exams, therefore no FELIX), I couldn't agree more although I think the\nmale:female ratio pales into insignificance\nnext to the too much beer mot too much\nbeer ratio; there may be only 1000\nbiologically female specimens at IC but\nthere are six million in London, so you'll\njust have to try a bit harder. Anyway,\nback to the point; shortly after the\npublications of BJ's enormously\nmerit worthy missive, his twin brother and\nthe doppelganger s of a number of his\nents cronies entered the RockSoc gig in\nthe lounge without paying and proceeded\nto hijack the disco, and indeed the rest of\nthe event, while under the influence of\nalcohol. Does BJ have a twin brother? I think we should be told?\nYours sincerely,\nJan Graham, MEPG.\nPS By way of precluding counter-argument, I accept that the members of\nIC RockSoc are not worthy of normal\nhuman consideration, since it is possible\nthat some of them may listen to Heavy\nMetal (Uuuuuurgh!) rather than the sort of\ngreat music that normally gets reviewed\non the music pages of FELIX.\nPPS I thought that gigs in the Union\nwere banned for the summer term\n(presumably to remove temptation from\nBeit Hall residents); this certainly applies\nto RockSoc, although obviously not to\nEnts. Whoops, I forgot, see PS (above).\nStress, Drugs, and Real Life\nDear Editor\nDr Raanan Gillon runs a health centre\nfor a college (our college) where the\nenvironment is highly competitive and\nstress levels particularly high. I was\ntherefore amazed at his comments in the\nEvening Standard (FELIX 901)\u2014that\nbeta blockers should be available to any\nstudents suffering from exam stress.\nNearly everyone suffers from it. What is\nthe criteria for diagnosing who should\nreceive drugs? Or is Dr Gillon suggesting\nthey be freely available?\nPeople have to cope with stress in\nevery aspect of life, whether academic,\njob-related or in their relationships with\nother people, and learning how to do it is\npart of what college is all about. If\nstudents feel that college is not giving\nthem the help and support they need to\nlearn how to cope naturally, then\nsomething is going wrong. There will\nalways be a minority for whom the\nprescription of beta blockers is medically\njustifiable in the short-term. But\nabnormally high levels of anxiety usually\nindicate the need for long-term help, such\nas counselling, to uncover the underlying\nproblem.\nWhat worries me is that Dr Gillon's remarks highlight a lack of an alternative.\nOften, stress needs an outlet\u2014someone\nwho will listen to fears and worries, and\nhelp students build the confidence to cope\nwith anxiety. Perhaps if counsellors were\nmore widely available, it would alleviate\nthe need for students to feel that\nprescription is the only way out.\nAnjana Ahuja, Physics PG.\nCompare these prices.\nDocument Wallet\nBookstore 20p WH Smith 40p Hole Punch\nBookstore SI.65\nWH Smith S1.95\ni10 Punched Pockets\nBookstore 70p WH Smith SI.10\nGlue Stick\nBookstore 70p WH Smith 90p Mini Staplers\nBookstore \u00a31.30\nWH Smith \u00a31.85\nRule\n,- Boo'\n2Sp lOp\nDividers\nBookstore Sport 55p/10 part 95p WH Smith Sport 90p/10 part \u00a31.69\nImperial College Union\nmaking your grant go further!!\n\n"

    "content": "Company Cars?\nThere are growing but unconfirmed\nreports that some members of the college\nstaff will have company cars in the next\nfinancial year. A source said that the\ncollege would simply act as a 'middleman'\nbetween car users and manufacturers.\nAccording to the source the 'deal ' would\nonly be available to those holding senior\nlectureship s and above. Since the college\nitself is allegedly not involved in any\nfinancial outlay and the cars are not\nperks the fact that such cars would only\nbe available to certain members of the\nacademic staff remains unexplained.\nFurther reports that the college health\ncentre budget has been cut in real terms\nare only pati ally true. The college\ncontribution will suffer a reduction in real\nterms in the next financial year but the\nloss is to be counterbalanced by an\nincreased NHS contribution. In total the\nbudget rise will still be ahead of projected\ninflation.\nPeaches 'n' Cream\nA survey carried out a week ago by\nPeach Tree, an external company\nexperienced with handling students'\nunions, is to be used for future plans to\novercome student apathy. Out of 1,500\nquestionnaires, containing SI vouchers for\nfood as an incentive, over 400 have been\ncompleted and returned. Only 300 were\nneeded to make the survey a statistical\nsuccess.\nUnion President, Paul Shanley,\ndescribed the number of forms returned\nas '...more than enough to be\nrepresentative'. He also said that it would\nbe more than a week before any useful\nresults would come out of the\ncomputerised data base.\nSchroclanger\nThe annual Schrodinger lecture, sponsored\nby IBM, was first scheduled for the Great\nHall but due to overwhelming interest it\nwas moved to Westminster Central Hall.\nThe guest speaker was Professor\nMandelbrot, the world renowned expert on\nchaos and fractals. The Rector, Sir Eric\nAsh, chaired the meeting.\nThe Schrodinger Lectures, started three\nyears ago, as part of a series of lectures\nopen to the public, a tradition at the college\nthat goes back over a century.\nBuses took special guests and stewards to\nthe meeting at Westminster. Some members\nof staff were critical of the re-organisation,\nbut this was effected well, with many\nstudents attending. However, losing the\ntradition of open events within college was\ncriticised.\nClanging Victory for\nJezebel\nWhoops!\nA Union van, hired out by Guilds and\nparked outside the Albert Hall, was towed\naway by the police on Wednesday night.\nA group from Guilds were bewildered\nwhen they returned to find the van\nmissing.\nFearing the worst, Chris Browne rushed\nto the Union Office to report the van as\nstolen. However, when Union President\nPaul Shanley rang the Police to report it\nas missing he was referred to another\nnumber, that of the Warwick Road\nholding pen, where the van was currently\nresiding.\nIn order to collect the van they were\nforced to hire another van from the\nUnion. There was some consternation\namongst the Guilds members when they\ndiscovered that it would cost \u00a3102 to\nhave the van released (\u00a385 fees and \u00a317\nfine), until they were informed that the\nPolice accept all major credit cards.\nJez, the RCS fire engine, came third in its\nclass in last week's London to Brighton\nrally. Motor Club Chairman, Rick Davis,\norganised a team of thirty-five people to\nwork the three-one hour shifts down to\nBrighton.\nThe team met at 5.30am on Sunday\nmorning and those not in the fire engine\ntravelled in two mini-buses. This year's rally marked the event's thirty year\nanniversary; Jez took part in the very\nfirst London-to-Brighton run in 1961. Mr\nDavis was '...absolutely dead c huffed' at\nJez's high placing against stiff competition\nin this year's run. He said that the team\nhad concentrated their efforts on Jez's engine rather than bodywork somewhat\nin contrast to the Morris Commercial\nTruck belonging to the RSM, that could\nsimply tag along on the run after her\nformal entry had been turned down.\n|\n3\n\n"
