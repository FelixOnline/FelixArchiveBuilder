    "content": "Letters\nRight of\nReply\nDear Pallab\nIt irked me no end when I realised that you were as guilty\nof some of the things you\naccused Gaynor of (Editorial,\nMay 25). Did you, for instance,\nconsult, or seek an opinion\nfrom Miss Gaynor about her\nalleged authoritarian ways? If\nnot, why not? If you did then\nwhy didn't you include them.\nI am aware of the right to\nreply facility you grant your\nreaders\u2014but surely if such\nserious allegations (most of\nwhich lacked substantiation) are\nmade about a person (whom\nyou admit to be conscientious\nand hard working) then the\neditor owes her a space within\nthe editorial\u2014especially since it\nis the editor who's made those\nallegations. She, unlike you\nPallab dear, does not enjoy the\nprivilege of writing a weekly\ncolumn that is widely read. She\nunlike you is thus denied a platform from which to express\nher personal view publicly!\n(Incidentally, was the article\nmerely one based on a personal\nview or was some sort of\nconsensus tapped?)\nIn the light of what I 've just1 said, don't you think some fair\nplay is in order. Or will you\nchoose to ignore my suggestion\nfor Gaynor to be given editorial\nspace next week and comments;\nafter all, you have the power to\ndetermine what is printed and\nwhat isn't. Will you, I wonder,\ndo a 'Gaynor' and thereby\nconfirm my belief that all\npeople in power are susceptible\nto accusations of authoritarianism\u2014Miss Gaynor and you\nbeing no exceptions? I await the\nnext issue with eagerness.\nSG Aswani\nMan Sci PG\n(How about it Gaynor? 400\nwords on ' Why I'm not a lousy\nPresident' by Monday-Ed.)\nPolitical\nInaction\nDear Pallab\nI would like to draw people's attention to one objection to the\nPresident's Report that was not\ncovered in FELIX last week.\nThis relates to the lack of\nactivity in External Affairs.\nI agree with the sentiments\nPage ^ \u2022 \u2022 nHM MH Lettes.to.t fie sailor expressed in last week's FELIX Editorial, that Gaynor Lewis\nhas worked hard and conscientiously this year, whilst\nat the same time has run a closed Union and not taken an\nactive part in the wider\ninterests of student matters.\nThe lack of commitment to\nExternal Affairs typifies this\nposition.\nIn answer to this criticism at\nthe AGM, she quoted her\nreport saying that she did not\nstand on a \"politically inclined\nplatform\" (sic) and that she\nregarded her duties within the\nwarm confines of the Union\nOffice as being of more\nimportance, and more within\nher influence.\nThis non-political attitude is\nan excuse for inaction. The\nPresident should be elected on\nthe grounds of his or her\npolitics, as it is the politics of the\nPresident that determines the\npolicy of the Union. Without\npolicies, the Union's function is\npurely administrative, and\ncould be done by a permanent\nmember of staff. What is the\npoint of electing secretaries?\nI see external affairs as being\none of the major political issues\nwhich will affect the whole of\nthe educational system\u2014IC\nincluded.\nNeglecting duties in the wider\nissues of external affairs to\nconcentrate solely on internal\nmatters is surely a short-sighted\npolicy. It leaves ICU isolated\nand inward looking, with no\noutside expression or influence\nother than through one or two\nhard working individuals. Pete\nBurt's tremendous contributions were surely overlooked\nwhen awarding higher Union\nhonours.\nLet's hope that next year's executive can be more dynamic,\nachieving more than good\nadministrative work, and not\nremain deaf and closed to\nstudent opinions and ideas as\ntypified by the U GM Chairman\nat the AGM. John Sattaur\nPhysics 3\nJingoistic\nShit-Stirrer\nDear Pallab\nOn the shoulders of Steve\nMarshall I march forth with my\nfaithful pen at my side.\nI write in response to\nGraham Brown's third glorious\noffering. An apparently standard defensive reply to last\nweek's comments it proceeded\nto spout typically Conservative\nbullshit. There are, no doubt,\nCuban backed forces in Africa\nand there have been massacres\nof innocent civilians (more\nnotably in Afghanistan and El\nSalvador) in the cause of Soviet\nand American hegemony but\nthis deliberate diversion of\nattention from the evils of\napartheid leads me to ask Mr Brown...Are you a friend of\nApartheid or simply a jingoistic\nshit-stirrer for President\nReagan?\nThe Sun and Express are\npleading for journalists with\nyour talents. Please leave our\nletter columns for more\nobjective comments and criticisms.\nYours objectively]\nAndrew Causebrook\nPS: I 've run out of coffee!\nHarassment\nand\nIntimidation\nDear Pallab\nIn his letter to you (FELIX\n674), Mr Burt (ICU External\nAffairs Officer) certainly\ndispelled any illusion he has\ntried to create of impartiality on\nthe subject of NUS. He seems to\nassume that the two 'Union\nofficers who were actually I present at' NUS conference |\nmust have seen every single\nincident that occurred there.\nHow else can he justify his\nrather unpleasant implication\nthat the undemocratic behaviour described by Mr Brown is a fabrication? As one\nof the Union officers Mr Burt\nplaces so much trust in was\nreported in last week's FELIX to have enjoyed 'eating,\ndrinking,' smoking' and\nscrewing' at the conference, his\npremise is unlikely to say the\nleast.\nFurthermore he claims that a smear campaign against the\nNUS has recently been\nlaunched by the Federation of\nConservative Students. This is\nnot true, FCS and its members\nhave always felt it their duty to\nkeep ordinary students informed of inefficiencies and\ninjustices that the NUS tries to\nhide beneath a facade of\nrepresentative ness and demo-c racy. As 40% of students voted\nconservative at the last general\nelection, and as every member\nof FCS has joined of his own\nfree will, FCS tul y represents\nthe interests of a larger\nproportion of students than\ndoes any other student\norganisation, including NUS( which is controlled by 'Clause\nFour' Marxists). Having talked\nto numerous FCS delegates\nwho have been 'actually\npresent' at NUS conferences,\nthe stories of harassment and\nintimidation that Mr Brown\ntells are depressingly familiar.\nICU seems to take a very\ncomplacent attitude to the\nNUS: 'We're OK. We're out of\nthat ob nox ius, blatantly party\npolitical organisation. We can\nspend our money on student\nactivities, and hold elections\nbased on individual merit.' If\nMr Burt had any sense of\nresponsibility, he would spend\nsome time helping less\nfortunate students from other\ncolleges with their d is affiliation campaigns. Instead of this he\nburies his head in the sand and\ntries to cover up for his left wing\nchums in NUS. Finally, I am glad to see that\nMr Brown (Consoc Chairmanelect) is continuing the all\nimportant fight against\nBolshevism at IC and wish him\nevery success in doing so,\nespecially as I am bored of it,\nand intend to do something\nelse.\nYours sincerely\nJonathan Gerson\nPS: Offers of jobs, marriage,\ndrinks etc gladly accepted.\nFriday, June 1, 1984 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nTHE LESSON OF '81\nWhen well on my way to\nmanaging the incredible feat of\nreading through all the annual\nreports in one go (almost\ncertainly a world record!) I came\nacross the RC C report and there I was made to ponder by a seemingly innocent paragraph.\nUnder the heading 'Club\nActivities' mention was made of\nthe 'Hazardous-rated' recreational clubs and of the\npraiseworthy scheme whereby\nthese clubs were offered the\nchance to send a number of\nmembers on a British Red Cross\nFirst Aid Course with RC C paying the fees.\nNow, I think this is a very good\nidea and I join Hugh Stiles, the\nRC C Chairman, in hoping that\nthe same scheme can be worked\nnext year.\nGreat!\nWhat left me wondering,\nhowever, was the mention of the\n\"spectre of Mountaineering\nClub's Christmas 81 tour\nclimbing accident\", and the claim\nthat a few safety policy\ndocuments \"will finally lay (it) to\nrest\". As it happens, I reckon that\nvery few of those who came to\nImperial since, know that there\nhas been an accident, and fewer\nstill know what happened or the\ntragic consequences. I myself\nlearnt about it from press reports\nat the time, but never heard of it\nwhen I came to Imperial the\nfollowing autumn as a fresher; in\nparticular, no one would talk\nabout it when I went on the\nMountaineers fresher s meet to\nBosigram.\nThe 'spectre' had been quickly\nlaid to rest in less than nine\nmonths.\nwrong attitude While it is most understandable that pe opole who had to\nendure the sorrow of seeing a fellow climber, and most of all, a friend, slowly die and not be able\nto help, would be reluctant to\nrecall and talk to outsiders about\nthose awful moments, the grief of\nwhich one cannot fully comprehend until one goes\nthrough the same ordeal, it\ncertainly is a duty of all who are\ninvolved in such activities and\nwho naturally are looked at by\nthe novices as masters, to make\npeople aware of the dangers\ninvolved.\nThe Union Officer's annual reports were\npublished last week. Here, Giovanni Vacago\nvoices some of his misgivings about the RCC\nchairman's report and suggests how mountain\nsafety can be improved\nLet me say here that I am not\ncriticising anyone in particular,\nnor just the Mountaineering Club\nor its membership. I am\ncriticising an attitude which is\nwidespread throughout many\nCollege clubs. That attitude\nwhereby to win to one's cause\nmore initiates, and therefore\nmore club members, only one\nside of the coin, invariably the\ngood one, is shown in due detail.\nThat attitude whereby the clubs,\nand in fact the whole Union setup renounced their educational\nrole.\nsafety threat Accidents can happen to even\nthe most experienced and safety\nconscious mountaineer, walker,\ncave r, canoeist or what have you,\nand with this in mind it is\nimportant that people should\nknow how to deal with them,\nhence the need for first aid\ncourses and the like.\nYet, more important still, is\nthat prospective mountaineers,\nwalkers etc be helped, I would\nalmost say forced, to gain\nexperience in a safe way and be\nstimulated to consider carefully\nthe safety aspects of their chosen\nactivity.\nWhenever accidents happen,\non a national level, there is an\noutcry of protest from people\noutside these sports, to whom the\nloss of life for the sake of a mountain, or for that of a deeper\ncave or a faster rapid seem a sign\nof absolute stupidity. At such\ntimes there is, invariably, a call\nfor the imposition of rules on\nthese sports: must this, must that.\nI imagine that even a climbing\nlicence has been thought of.\nbeyond rules Yet, by their very nature, these\nsports are, and can only be,\nbeyond rules.\nIt is questionable that the\ndrawing of such a set of rules\nunder the disguise of a 'safety\npolicy document' will be either\nacceptable to or accepted by the\nfreedom seeking individual.\nUltimately, responsibility lies\nwith the individual since s/ he will\nmake the final judgement on the\nconditions and is the only one\nwho will have the last word on\nwhether s/ he is up to the\nstandard required for that\nparticular route/cave/rapid.\nInstead of trying to design such\na set of rules, which people for\nover a century have denied could\nexist, the main effort by the\nUnion and the clubs should be to\nput individuals in a position\nwhere they are able to take such\ndecisions knowledgeably and\nin de pen cent ly of outside\npressures.\nI am not suggesting that RC C safety policy documents, as they\nstand, try and enforce such a set\nof rules. I und est and they only go\nas far as disco u arg ing people\nfrom undertaking solo ventures,\nrequiring them to state clearly\nwhat their plan for the day is and\nat what time they expect to come\nback and other things like these.\nWhat I am saying is that these\nmeasures do not in fact go far\nenough towards preventing\naccidents, but one must admit\nthat they make things easier\nshould any trouble arise. I am\nalso saying that the end of the line\nhas been reached on that front\nand that if tomorrow another\naccident came to shake our\nconsciences, no further restrictions should or could be\nimposed on 'hazardous' clubs.\nRather the emphasis must\nswitch to education of the\nindividual and we must act now,\nin order to prevent accidents, not\ntomorrow, in their wake; the life\nof a friend is too high a price for\nour learning.\nThe more experienced members should not only\nintroduce the novices to the\ntechnical aspects of the sport, but\nalso the problems involved and\nhow to surmount them; the\nnovices should be also introduced to how to look after\nthe club's and their own\nequipment (how much Union\nmoney is thrown away each year\nin replacing equipment that, if\nproperly looked after, would last\nmuch longer!) and to the respect\ndue to the environment one's activity brings in contact with;\ngenerally, they should be helped\nto learn to approach the sport\nwith a well balanced attitude and\nto be able to say 'no, not today!'.\nIn High magazine (no 9, AprilMay 1983, pi1) just after a party\nof two teachers and seven .\nschoolboys fell some 800ft down\na gully and two of them died, Vin\nMachin,a Mountaineering\nInstructor, was quoted to have\nsaid: \"Climbers spend a lot of\nmoney on equipment and they\nmake elaborate arrangements to\nget to the mountains for a weekend's climbing. They feel\nthey must attempt their chosen\nclimb even in poor conditions or\neven if there are too many people\nalready on the climb.\"\ncowardly decision? During a weekend trip to\nNorth Wales with the Scout and\nGuide Club last winter, a party of\nfour amongst the most experienced climbers in the club\nturned back in the face of\navalanche danger even from a climb rated at the easiest end of\nthe scale. There was no sense of\nshame or failure, rather consciousness that the right\ndecision had been taken,\nalthough a difficult one when one\ngets all the way from London to\nthe foot of the climb for nothing.\nHow many others would have\ndone the same?\nHow many more would have\nfelt press uri sed by the presence of\nothers not to take a decision\nwhich might seem cowardly?\nIt is not being cowardly, it is\nbeing sane!\nLet the Union and the clubs\nhelp people to take sane\ndecisions, when these are called\nfor.\nOnly then will we have learnt a lesson from the tragedy on that\ncold winter day in 1981.\nGiovanni Vacago\nPage 6 l* Friday, June 1, 1984] I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "To taste a wine it is necessary to take a good mouthful and swirl it around the mouth,\nso that all the taste buds come in contact with\nit. It is often helpful to aerate the wine by\ndrawing air into the mouth with an\nunsophisticated guzzling noise. Try to notice\nthe balance or otherwise of the fruit and acids\nin the wine, the amount of mouth puckering\ntannin, the length of time the flavour lingers in\nthe mouth, and anything distinctive which\nyou might recognise again.\nIf your budget is as limited as mine, and I suspect that for most of you it is, then there\nare very few occasions when you can splash\nout on a very expensive bottle of wine. I don't believe that it is worth looking for a cheap\nbottle of claret, the contents are all too likely\nto be very disappointing. The same goes for\nmany of the well known names, it is best to\nleave their delights until you can afford a decent example. In the meantime there are\nmany lesser known wines to be inexpensively\nenjoyed.\nMalvaza, and there is some experimentation\nwith French varieties. Where the old\nBordeaux methods are practised the wines\nare aged for up to ten years in oak casks. This\nreduces their fruit in ess, replacing it with a soft vanilla flavour from the oak. I found a pamphlet on Rioja wines which revealed the\nsecrets of their production this way: \"The\nfirst breeding of our wines takes place during\nthe period the wine remains in American oak\ncasks of 2251ts, being afterwards bottled in\nthe best conditions in order it may develop all\nits strength during the second breeding in the\nbottle; for this they must remain in horizontal\nposition in a fresh, dark place with little\noscillations of wetness and temperature.\"\nSmall independent producers are not\nall lowed to market their wine as Rioja, and so\nthe industry is dominated by the big\n'bodegas'. Some of these have their own\nvineyards, others buy in the grapes, making\nand aging large quantities /-^-s/ ine which is\nusually only released whe i drunk. Thus the names on bottles of Rioja are\nbrand names rather than the names of\ngrowers or their properties. Bodegas Minga\nproduce wine in the traditional way, the total\nv in if i cation is carried out in wood. On the\nother hand Bodegas Olarra was built in 1972\nand produces very good examples of the\nmore modem style of wine from this region.\nOther names worth looking for include\nFrederico Paternina, Tondonia and Marques\nde Caceres. The wines should have a small\nlabel on the back with a map of Rioja and the\nword Crianza, Reserva or Gran Reserva.\nThese indicate increasing maturation.\n//you would like more information on wine\nand wine tasting come along to any meeting\nof the Wine Tasting society (usually held at\n6.00pm on Tuesdays). A recommended text\non the choosing, buying and serving wine is\nWine by Hugh Johnson published by\nEmblem.\nJulia Newton-Howes\nThe Regions\nOne region which provides very good\nvalue for money is Rioja in Northern Spain.\nGeographcially this region is quite close to\nBordeaux, and when ph yl lox era( an insect\nfeeding on plant juices) arrived there in the\n1870s many wine growers moved South to\nRioja and started making wine. Phylloxera\ncaught up with them in the end, and they\nwent back to Bordeaux, leaving behind\ntraditional French methods of wine\nproduction.\nThe grapes of Rioja are Tempranillo,\nGraciano, Mazuelo, Granacha, Viura and\n'It's a naive domestic burgundy without any breeding, but I think\nyou'll be amused by its presumption.'\nFALMOUTH KEOGH\nHALL\nAppointment of Assistant SubWarden\nApplications are invited for the post of Assistant\nSubwarden of Falmouth Keogh Hall.

Or do you\nprefer a full body? Or do you just want a bit of sparkle in your otherwise lacklustre\nlife? Whether you simply want to enjoy a good glass of wine or to impress your\nfriends FELIX, in conjunction with Wine\nTasting Society, gives you all the answers\nin this special wine feature.\nWine naturally on the skin grape, will if the skin becomes\nA brief history\nWine is as old as the grape, and it was\nproduced well before Homo Sapiens\nappeared. Wine producing yeasts\nwhich of a ripe\nbroken, turn the grapes sugar to alcohol.\nThis is the essence of wine making, although\nlarger scale production has many\ncomplications.\nThe human hand has been turned to wine\nmaking for a very long time. Wine was prepared\nin prehistoric Mesopotamia and in Egypt\nbefore 3000BC. The Old Testament\nmentions the wines of Syria and the fragrant\nwines of the Lebanon. Vines and wine\nmaking were probably introduced to France\nand Italy by the Greeks around 1000BC. The\nRomans, who must have been very fond of\nswilling the odd goblet, did their bit to spread\nviticulture. They were responsible for\nestablishing the vineyards of the Rhone\nValley, the Loire, Bordeaux and Burgundy,\nas well as planting vines along the Moselle\nand Rhine.\nThrough the Dark Ages the Church kept\nalive the art of wine making. Until fairly\nrecently the church owned most of the\ngreatest vineyards of Europe and it has been\nresponsible for many of the developments in\nwine making which are still important today.\nThe characters of the wines produced in\nthe various traditional regions of Europe\nhave thus emerged gradually over the\ncenturies. Perhaps by luck, perhaps by trial\nand error different grape varieties have been\nintroduced and become standard for each\narea. There are now complicated laws\nenforcing these standards, aimed at\nprotecting the consumer, but often\nsucceeding only in confusing him or her. In\ncontrast to this Californian and Australian\nvineyards were started in the nineteenth\ncentury and many new areas have been\nplanted in the last fifty years. Here the choice\nPage 1 JBrWrWMBIIM^^\nof vine has been a matter of judgement made\nwith modern agricultural knowledge and in\nthe light of European experience, with some\ndelicious results.\nWine production today has been\nrevolutionised by new scientific methods.\nThe ability to monitor and control the\nchemical and physical changes that take\nplace during fermentation has on the whole\nhelped the wine maker to avoid producing\nreally poor product. However, very often it\nwill not be very good either. There seems to\nbe a general trend towards producing vast\nquantities of pleasant wine which will neither\noffend nor excite anyone.\nImpressing your\nfriends\nYou may not particularly wish to impress\nyour friends by recognising a'71 Chateau\nFonplegade or winning blind tasting\ncompetitions, but even so it is very useful to\nbuild up some small mental catalogue of\nwines. This can be started and expanded by\ntasting wine rather than just swallowing it. Of\ncourse one man's meat and all that is very\ntrue and tasting is a subjective exercise. The\nvarious terms used by wine drinkers are\nbadly defined and tend to become\nincreasingly so as the evening wears on. The\nimportant thing is to remember your own\nterms and judgements and to use them\nconsistently.\nMost wine comes straight out of the EEC wine lake, an endless blend from every\noverproducing vineyard in Europe and North\nAfrica. This wine is best swallowed whilst\nthinking about something else, there is no\nneed to look for delicate smells or subtle\nflavours. Well made wine is usually\nexpensive, however with careful selection\none can find interesting and delicious wines\nat a reasonable price. Good places for\nsearching out such bargains include Majestic\nHH Pf fW lH Friday. June 1, 1984 HB1 Wine Warehouse (but you must buy at least\n12 bottles), some of the large chains of off-licences (especially Oddbins) and some\nsupermarket own label wines.\nWhen buying a bottle of wine you have to\nrely on the information given on the label.\nUnfortunately there is un doubt ably a fair\namount of fraudulent wine on sale in this\ncountry, and this is good reason for dealing\nwith reputable wine merchants. Assuming\nthe labelling is genuine, the amount and type\nof information given depends on the laws of\nthe country of origin, the shipper, wine\nmerchant and so on. It takes a little while to\nbecome familiar with even the more basic\nterms, but it is a fascinating and rewarding\nstudy. Fortunately it is becoming increasingly\ncommon to include back labels with fairly\ntechnical information in simple terms\u2014these\nremove much of the guess work.\nWhen you drink a bottle of wine, try to\nremember some things about it. Obviously\nit's important to be able to recognise the label\nagain, it's not much use to know you drank\nsome really delicious wine if you're not sure\nwhere it was from or who made it. When you\npour some in your glass, look at the colour:\nred wine can vary from purple to deep amber.\nGenerally the more purple the wine the\nyounger it is, and it will become paler and\nbrowner with age. White wines may be green,\ngold or even amber, and they tend to gain\ncolour with age.\nThe next thing to notice is the smell, or\nbouquet, of the wine. Smells can be very\nevocative, but are rather more difficult to\nquantify than colours. -The bouquet is often\ncharacteristic of the grape varieties used in\nthe wine, and some rather odd terminology\nhas arisen in the cataloguing of these smells.\nThus the tangy aroma of the shiraz grape has\nbeen described as 'sweaty saddle' and the\npinot noir smells rather of boiled beetroot or\ncabbage.\nI FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nPlaying with fire The fire alarms in Southside Halls continue to go off regularly,\ndespite assurances from the Estates section that the problem has\nbeen reduced \"almost to zero\". The alarm sounded on both\nSunday night and Monday night at the beginning of a week when\nmany students have exams. Wardens are concerned that residents\nare effectively left without a fire alarm since, because ofthe large\nnumber of false alarms, residents are taking no notice of the\nalarm.\nOne Warden in Southside has\nalready said that he doubts he\ncould evacuate his Hall in the\nevent of a real emergency. In\naddition many residents are\nfurious that their sleep is being\ndisturbed during the revision\nperiod.\nThe Estates Section claim that\nthey are controlling the situation\nby monitoring false alarms, and\nreplacing faulty smoke detectors\neach time they go off. But M rWD Evans, Chief Engineer, was\nunaware on Wednesday that the\nalarm had gone off over the\nholiday weekend. It wasn't until\nFELIX contacted Estates that\nthe contractor fitting the system\nwas informed of the latest false\nalarms.\nThe problem arises from\nsmoke detectors that are\nactivated by fumes from toasters,\nsaid Mr Evans. \"Students will\nmake toast, and when they make\ntoast they burn it,\" he added.\nSome residents were sceptical of\nthis explanation since the alarms\nhave regularly gone off between\nthe hours of 2:00 and 3:00am. The Estates section claim that\nthey are informed by Sherfield\nsecurity every time the alarm in\nSouthside goes off. Fire Officer\nBob Foggon then authorise s replacement of the faulty\ndetector by the contractors, Fire\nAlarm Clock Equipment( FACE) Ltd.\nNO 676m\\%% wm\\%%%\\w mw mw m The new fire alarm system was\ninstalled by FACE more than two\nmonths ago to bring Southside\ninto line with GLC fire\nregulations. The plans included\nthe fitting of smoke detectors in\ncommunal areas and landings\nand it is largely, though not\nexclusively, these smoke\ndetectors that have caused\nproblems.\nThe original spate of false\nalarms more than a month ago,\nwas attributed to \"teething\nproblems\". On Wednesday, the\nChief Engineer, M rWD Evans,\nfelt able to say that the problem is\nreduced to zero and that FACE are a good firm that have been\nused before and will be used\nagain.\nPortrait\nThe Rector of Imperial College,\nLord Flowers, is to have his\nportrait painted in June. This is\nto celebrate his 60th birthday in\nSeptember.\nDepartments are being invited\nto contribute up to \u00a3250 each\ntowards the cost of the painting, a birthday present to the Rector.\nThe distinguished artist Kyffin\nWilliams RAO BE is to be\ncommissioned to paint the\nRector. It is thought that only\ntwo sittings will be necessary.\nWater Calamity!\nThe Chemistry New Building was\nleft without power and lighting\nover the weekend and Bank\nHoliday. The main power cable\nwas burnt through after water\nleaked from the seventh floor to\nthe sub-basement.\nOriginal fears that the\ninterruption in supply would\ncause serious damage proved\nunfounded, and long term\ndamage should be minimal.\nIt is thought that the flood was\ncaused when a water tap vacuum\npump burst. A large volume of\nwater then percolated its way\nthrough the building, fusing the\npower supply when ground level\nwas reached.\nThe Central Stores depart-ment, which is situated in the\nbasement of Chemistry, felt the\nfull effect of the power failure. An electric sewage pump failed, and\nvolumes of sewage started to\nbuild up in the stores. Workers\nfrom the Estates section cleared\nthe sewage using brooms.

    "content": "News\nConfidence Trickster\nA confidence trickster, posing\nas a student, obtained money\nfrom an IC postgraduate on\nTuesday under false s pretences.\nThe man, an African about 6ft tall, approached a number of\nstudents and said that he was\ndestitute. He then offered a forwarding address in return for\na 'loan' of cash. Union officers\nwere suspicious when it became\napparent that he had given\ndifferent names and addresses to\ndifferent students.\nHe also attempted to obtain\ncash from the Union Office,\nsaying that he needed it for train\nfare.\nUnion President Gaynor Lewis\nwarned students to be on their\nguard and on*no account to part\nwith any money if approached by\nthis man.\nDepartments\nare unsafe\nAn officer from the Health and\nSafety Inspectorate has been\ntouring Imperial College over the\nlast few days. Already she has\nserved 'improvement notices' on\ntwo departments, informing\nthem of unsafe working conditions or apparatus. The\ndepartments involved, Civil Engineering and Aeronautical\nEngineering, face substantial\nfines if they fail to carry out the\nnecessary improvement work.\n!\nMissing!\nMembers of the College administration were shocked to\nnotice the disappearance last\nmonth of Mr Alf Toft, Surveyor\nin the Estates section. One day he\nturned up for work as usual, the\nnext day he was gone. Dismayed\ncolleagues realised that he wasn't coming back when his office was\ncleared out by cleaning staff.\nSpeculation is also rife at the\nmoment regarding Mr Don Clarke, Head of the Estates\nsection. He is at a course in\nReading at the moment; will he\nhave a job to come back to when\nthey've taught him to read?\nUnion sanctions\nagainst College\nThe IC Branch of the Association\nof Scientific, Technical and\nManagerial Staffs ( ASTM S) resolved on Friday, at an\nemergency meeting, to take\nsanctions against the College.\nThe list of sanctions is not\nexhaustive, but include withdrawal of technicians from\nCollege committees, refusal to\noperate untested electrical\nequipment and refusal to cover\nfor absence due to sickness or\nholidays.\nThe dispute arises from a disagreement over the Easter\nHoliday arrangements. Technical staff took what they\nthought was their proper\nentitlement, but in three\ndepartments such staff had their\npay stopped for one day.\nA delegation from ASTM S went to see Mr John Davidson,\nPersonnel Secretary. He refused\nto consider refunding the staff\npay unt nil proper holiday\narrangements were finalised. The\nASTM S refused to negotiate\nuntil members have their pay\nrestored.\nThe staff who had pay docked\nwere from just three depart-ment s: Elec Eng, Chem Eng and\nGeology. Departmental Superintend ants in these\ndepartments were instructed by\npersonnel to supply a list of those\nwho took the holiday in question.\nThe College dealt with the\nsituation by paying staff a negative amount of pay for the\nday concerned. ASTM S President, Harry Fairbrother,\nhas responded by telling members\nto write cheques for negative\namounts and send them to\nCollege.\nThe sanctions are likely to\ncause severe problems in certain\ndepartments, particularly where\ntechnicians operate vital electrical equipment. The\nASTM S have pledged, however,\nthat under no circumstances will\ntheir dispute affect examinations.\n^ IDIICTT WEEKEND tor two in\nYes, folks we've done it again!

    "content": "Playing with Fire\nThere are bound to be a few teething troubles when a new fire alarm system is\ninstalled. False alarms and faulty detectors are to be expected in the first\ncouple of weeks. However the newly installed fire alarm system in Southside\nare still going off spuriously eight weeks after they were first installed. This\nstate of affairs would be irritating at the best of times, but is intolerable\nduring the exam term. Not only is students' revision being disturbed but they\nare woken up at 2:00 or 3:00am in the morning when they have an exam that\nday.\nPerhaps more worrying is the fact that since there are two or three false\nalarms per week no one is taking any notice when the alarms go off. If there is\na fire in louth side it is going to be impossible to evacuate the building. The\nbungling and incompetence of the Estates section has become a tired joke\naround College. In this instance one would expect the matter to be treated\nwith a little more seriousness when the lives of 300 Southside residents are at\nrisk.\nDirty Weekend\nDo you fancy a free weekend for two in Paris after your exams? Well that's what you could win if you enter the FELIX/ ST A travel quiz(see page 3). All you have to do is answer the travel questions in this and next weeks' FELIX correctly and you could win a wonderful weekend in Paris.\nHelp\nAs we enter the height of the exam period all activity has well and truly\nground to a halt. There's hardly any news to report, the FELIX staff are busy\nwith their exams and you dear readers have stopped writing articles, letters\nand even small ads. There are still two more issues of FELIX to go so if you\nknow of any news (anything at all) or if you have finished your exams and can\nlen'_ a hand on FELIX pop into the Office. Particularly required are people\nto collate pages of FELIX on Thursday evenings at about 8:30pm.

The FELIX Car Rally\nThe FELIX Editor, PallabWhow, has got a reputation\nas a scatterbrain. This was borne out by the events of\nlast week.\nHe sent me five notes about the FELIX Car Rally,\neach stating the date of the Rally, the time of\nstarting, the starting place, the maximum membership of each team and whether or not I needed a car. The five notes read as follows:\n20 June, start 9:30, FELIX Office, maximum of four\na team; car needed.\n21 June, start 10:30, outside Mech Eng, maximum\nof two in a team; car not needed.\n22 June, start 11:30, FELIX Office, maximum of six\nin a team, car not needed.\n23 June, start 11:30, FELIX Office, maximum of\nthree in a team, car not needed.\n24 June, start 10:30, outside Huxley, maximum of\nfive in a team, car needed.\nWhen I questioned Zam about the FELIX Car\nRally, she told me that each of the notes was right in\ntwo of its five details.\nSo, what are the details of the FELIX Car Rally?\nGood luck, everyone.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday, please. \u00a35,\ncourtesy of Mend-a Bike, for the randomly selected\nwinner.\nLast week's solution\nIt can be shown that a circle cut with n lines has a maximum of 1\n/2 n(n+1)+1 pieces.

    "content": "Clubs\nPhilippines Support Group\nWhile much publicity has been\ngiven to the situations in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Poland etc\nthere does not seem to be a great\ndeal of general knowledge about\nwhat is going on in the\nPhilippines.\nA meeting of the Philippines\nSupport Group, chaired by\nLabour MP Tom Clarke, on 5\nMay outlined the situation of a country which has been under the\ndictatorship of President Marcos\nsince 1972, when martial law was\ndeclared. Trade unions, student\norganisations and political\nparties were all banned and\nopposition was forced under-ground.\nSince then, over 70,000 people\nhave been detained as political\nprisoners, two thirds have been\ntortured and some have\n' disappeared' in custody. Government troops have killed\nover 100,000 people, often by a means ironically known as\n'salvaging', whereby the bodies\nare mutilated. After a recent\ndemonstration the bodies of four\nstudents were found salvaged.\nUS military aid to Marcos in\n1982 was $ 140.1m, plus $100m rental for US bases. This year the\nUS have agreed to pay $900m as\nrent for 22 American military\nbases in the Philippines, some of\nwhich store nuclear weapons.\nWhile the Philippines is a 'rich'\ncountry, the economy is\ndominated by American, Japanese and European multinational companies, so 80% of\nthe population live on or below\nthe poverty line.\nWages are among the lowest in\nAsia, unemployment is 40% and\nhundreds of thousands are forced\nto leave the Philippines to look\nfor work.\nOpposition to the Marcos\nregime is led by the National\nDemocratic Front in a revolutionary alliance; the major\narmed force within the ND F is\nthe New Peoples Army which\noperates in 53 out of 73\nprovinces. The Moro National\nLiberation Front leads resistance\nin the Muslim Provinces.\nOpposition also comes in the\nform of trade unions, religious\ngroups and a variety of political\norganisations openly campaign-Small Ads\nFOR SALE\n\u202210 speed gents bike in excellent\ncondition, only \u00a370.
