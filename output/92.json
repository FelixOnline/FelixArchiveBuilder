    "content": "1 FELIX BRITISH INTER-UNIVERSITY\nCONFERENCE This Easter an informal Inter-University conference was\nheld at Southampton University. The purpose of this meeting\nwas to enable the officers of Students Unions to get together\nand discuss the many problems wh i oh arise in the running of\na University or College Union, and the different ways in dealing with them. An air of spontaneity and free exchange of\ninformation and points of view was maintained throughout ths\nconference, and kept up a discussion free from points of order,\npoints of information and debating trio ks,w hi oh seem somewhat to mar other student gatherings.\nOf the many top ios discussed, one of particular interest\nwas the problem of introducing overseas students to British\nUniversity life and helping them to settle down. It was\ngenerally agreed that overseas fresher s' receptions are a bad\nthing, as it makes the student feel o on spi cio us, and does not\nhelp to integrate him'into the community. Similar sentiments\nwere expressed about the existance of \"NationalisfClubs,\nwhich, owing to their \"oli quis h\" tendency draw fresher s into\na small oom mut y of his own oo un try men, and do not introduce\nhis to the student body in general.\nThe be3t approach to this was presented by Nottingham\nUniversity whore each overseas fresher is met by one English\nhost who accompanies him for the first fortnight of the ses s ion. First he helps the fresher with general problems (e.g. currency), and then introduces him informally to university\nlife by showing him around the union, inviting him to o of fee parties etc., so that he n ill meet people quickly and soon\nfind his feet. This will prevent the fresher from retiring\ninto his shell and wishing to meet only people from his own\noo un try. We would be interested to reo i eve the opinions of overseas students on these points of view.\nThe problem of maintaining a decent standard of behaviour\nin a new Union building was mentioned. Other unions who have\nrecently opened new premises had found that making an appeal\nin their newspapers when the buildings had been opened, and\nunobtrusive verbal approaches to bad offenders, had proved\nsufficient. Any system of fining was strongly deprecated.\nDuring the discussion on Religious and polit io al Societies,\ntheir existence was agreed to j provided that the nana of the\nUnion wa j never allowed to become associated with o on tro v ssw si al views which these so oie ties may express. Of the twenty Unions\nwhich attended the meeting, five\ngive no financial aid to such\nso oie ties, and moat unions have\nsimilar rules to I.C.U. far their\nformation.\nIt is interesting to note\nthat I.C. Bar is the only Union\nBar in the oo un try to open on\nSundays, and that several unions\nrestrict union facilities during\nvacations and on Sundays, when\nsome are not even allowed their\nathletic grounds.\nNearly all the twenty unions present at the oo nfs reo os publish a newspaper. All, except FELIX, have union subsidy.\nH \u00b0\nmm TO\n) OH I It)1( Monday) \\ ]\u2022\n_i \u2014\nt bouc bi wtc we The Touohstone weekend on Hay 5th6 th was on the topic\nof 'Bohioide and the Death Penalty'. *he Guest Speaker ,\nMr. C.R.

One of the best aspects of this, was '\nthat all the dancers were present at the beginning, and the\narrival of couples when it had 'warmed up' was avoided. The\nlavish dinner farmed a compulsory warming up.\nThs Country House Ball is unique, The Royal College of\nSolano* being the only one with an out of town residence.

Besides ths.\ndivided nature of their oo un try, the Germans showed much con\nconcern at signs of latent militarism. Th* following is from\nS.A.K.'a report of ths o ogress. There is one disquieting aap eot of German Universities,\nespecially prevalent in the older ones such as Heidelberg.\nThis is the existence of corporations, or fraternities, who\nhold formal meetings in order to participate in a bloody type\nof rapier fighting. Contestants stand face to face at a fixed distance, with rapiers held pointing vertically,\nwith th* hand holding the rapier just in front of the nose.\nEach contestant then tries to flick at his opponents head,\nalthough he must not drop his hand below a certain level.\nTh* rapiers are so thin and elastic that it is possible to\ninflict severe outs in the head and on the face, leaving\n\"soars of honour*. The most absurd rule ia that a combatant\nis not allowed to take any evasive action at all. If he\nknows the rapier is on its way to hls'.h sad, he must stand\nstock still to demonstrate his courage and manhood. Sometimes contestants are standing in a pool of blood before the\nacknowledged time of the oom bat has expired. These fraternities were founded at about the time of Napoleon, and it is the custom of old students to return to fraternity meetings.\nAfter th* war these frats ni ties no longer existed, but were\nrevived by old students* It is In such organisations that\nmany German students fear the spark of militarism or nationalism may again on* day rear its ugly head. In the large\nmodern universities, such fraternities are p rao tio all n non-a xia tant. TONIGHT TONIGHT\nAYKTON HALL.

    "content": "FELIX^ T fert cr Be u tSi ije \u00a3i>t u ben ten tag Once every two years German students hold a rally at which they meet to discuss some problem.\nThis year's rally, attended by about 3,000 stud-ents, was held in Hamburg to discuss \"The Student\nin Society.\"\nThe organisers of this year's\" student en tag\" decided to combine the occasion with a meeting of\nrepresentatives of students of other Kuropean\ncountries. From jing land they invited one representative from 1J.U.S., which, they know, claims to represent student opinion in this country; and one\nfrom Imperial Colle'ge, which they know to be the\nbest scientific and largest technical college in the country.\nSimilar invitations were sent by the University\nof Berlin - Charlottenburg to their recent international meeting, which on this occasion fell in\nthe same year as the student en tag. Since, however,\nU. li.S. fails somewhat apathetically to send representatives to these occasions, the representative \"\nfrom Imperial College has on each occasion been the\nonly i&i glis h student present.\nAltogether there were sixteen foreign visitors\nto Hamburg. It is indeed gratifying to know that\nImperial College enjoys such an excellent international reputation that it alone of all j inglish colleges is invited to send a representative to such\nfunctions.\nThe full value of contacts of this sort is impossible to estimate. Such meetings certainly foster understanding and goodwill between the students\nof jiu rope an countries, and give the students of each\ncountry the chance to appreciate the other fellow's difficulties. i 'he thoughts of German students turn inevitably\nto the present plight of their country, and its effect on their lives and activities. Despite claims\nof the \"f re a democratic\" Eastern zone of better\nconditions for their students, a steady stream of\nstudents leave the j a st for the West. The lot of a West (i erm an stud j nt is by no means easy; only about\n21% receive any financial assistance. Host of the\nremainder have to work hard during the vacations,\nor at night,to make ends meet. They can afford only\nthe poorest of \"digs\", and student hostel ac como dat ion is hopelessly inadequate. Many German students\nare busy advocating a similar system of grants to\nthe British one.\nThe foreign\"guests were royally entertained.\nTrips were organised round Hamburg harbour, and to\nLubeck and the Baltie Sea. A reception on the night\nof arrival soon found the foreign delegates chatting\nanimatedly to one another. A cocktail party given\nby a gentleman who described himself as \"American\nCultural Attache\" was also a great success.. During\nit one of the foreign delegates don red a j jair of outsize sunglasses. On -being questioned about this surprising manoeuvre he explained: \" I put t, hem>Oi. so\nthe people they cannot see my eyes they is bloodshot.\"\nAnother foreign delegate attended a German \"hop\".\nWhen asked '\"hat he thought of it he replied that he\nwas diss appointed: \"There was no life; there was no\ndrunken men and there was' no dancing on the tables.\"\nAfter swopping addresses, the foreigners returned\nhome. I.C. now has valued and interesting contacts\nin many iS u rope an countries. For many years we have\nbeen, firm friends of the Universities of je lft and\nGroningen in Holland through the reciprocated visits of sports teams. Other teams have visited\nFrance, Germany and Denmark. Several students of\nthe University of'Berlin - Chart.otten burg, have vi sited I.C. and several I.C. students have paid return\nvisits, headers are reminded that a scholarship for\nanyone who would like to live and study in Berlin\nfor a year has beer, offered.\nPerhaps I.C. could do its share in fostering\ninternational stud j nt goodwill by inviting ire si dents of the leading liu rope an technical colleges and\nuniversities to a stay in I.C. sometime next year,\nif hen the new Union will be on view.\nEXPLORATION PROJECT, REYDARFJORD, Summer 1956\nThe second stage in the\nexploration of a region, fol lowing upon the preparation by\ntravellers and surveyors of\nthe first topographic maps, is marked by the incursion of\ngeologists, who find out what\nthe country is made of. This\ngeological work is true exploration in the fullest meaning\nof the word, and the geologist\nhas that feeling, common to all explorers, of never knowing\nwhat lies around the-next corner or across the next mount-ain.\nThe small expedition to\nIceland planned for this summer\nis for such geological exp lor ation. The area that it is planned to cover is reasonably\naccessible and is covered by\nquite good topographic outlines\nThe expedition will consist of\ntwo undergraduate geology stud-ents, Peter Ibbotson-and Malcrcls\nMcQueen; one post-graduate research student, Ian Carmichael,\na welcome refugee from a rival concern (Cambridge); and lecturer G.P.L. Walker.\nThe area that it is planned to study lies around\nReydarfjord, a deep indentation midway along the\nBast Coast of Iceland. This summer's work will be\na continuation and an extension of a study that was\ncommenced las js year following a reconnaissance visit in 1954, and it in part of a long-term research pro-j ect. By British standards Iceland is a bleak and barren country, yet it Is nevertheless Tery beautiful,\nO.P. L. WALKiSR, a popular lecturer in the Geology\nDepartment, is a specialist in the type ef rooks\nthe expedition will study. Be has na de field studies ef basaltic re ck in Antrim and ether\nplaces where they outcrop.\nand the people are very\n\u2022friendly and hospitable.\nThe climate is much lass\nsevere than is suggested\nby the name, and it is a pity that Iceland is relatively neglected by British tourists. The plan\nis to spend the first fortnight travelling about in\nSouth-west and North Iceland in the expedition\nvehicle, visiting classic\ngeological exposures, and\nspend the remaining six to\nnine weeks on detailed\n\\ geological mapping at Reydarfjord.\nThe country in which\nthe work will be done is very mountainous and is sparsely populated, and it will be necessary to camp\nand live under expedition\nconditions for the whole\nduration of the visit. One\ncan only hope that it will not rain all the time, and\nthat the midges will not\nbe too belligerent.\nThe rocks composing Iceland are almost exclusively\nVolcanic, and belong to a period in the distant\npast when hundreds of thousands of cubic miles of\nbasalt lavas were poured out onto a land surface\nstretching probably continuously from the British Isles to Greenland; volcanic lavas that are still to be seen in the Inner Hebrides, Antrim, the Faroes , Iceland and Greenland; lavas which in places\n(for instance, at Reydarfjord) have accumulated to\na thickness of four to six miles. Some of the\nvolcanoes are still active in Iceland, 140 eruptions\nhaving been recorded over the past 1,000 years.\nWith luck one of these volcanoes nay put on a show\nfor I.C. this sus wie r. "

Moreover, such rules would tend to be oppressive.\nEviction was the punishment for any student whose conduct was\nconsidered an extreme oas e of irresponsibility.\nResidents have long been proud of this liberal treatment,\nand have learned to tolerate other peoples idiosyncrasies or\nto tell them off appr opiate ly. Unfortunately, on the evening\nof May 1st., the ruL s s were modified. The Residents committee\n'agreed' that the disciplinary sub-oom mitte e be empowered to\n'gate' Residents who oom ra it certain disciplinary offences\n(unspecified). If it was agreed, then the student represent\nat ive a betrayed their electorate. More likely it was passed\nby a majority.

It was.also\nagreed without consultation with the disciplinary committee c who nominally would have to mete out this punishment.\nTwenty eight Year Plan Fortunately moat of the current residents have not been\nintimidated by this absurd sanction, and have actually tended\nto be more boisterous than before it was introduced.

Ibis system can only be deprecated as it makes\nit impossible for anyone attending the dinner to break\ninto the cliquish groups.\nAt one time it was the system that before port, anyone\nwho wished could change his place, thereby facilitating the\nmaking of sew friendships. This ia never suggested any longer,\nmainly be o a use the various groups prefer not to mix. It is\nalso embarrassing now be o a use of the numerous after dinner\ntoasts, and one can never be certain when the-chairman is\ngoing to propose yet another, and ends own guests will have\nto toast 'our distinguished guests'.\nThis dinner ia most enjoyable and an important social\namenity of the oo lle ge life. It is hoped that in the future\nthey will be a function where staff, students and their guests\n\u2022set on a social footing.\nMOTOR CLUB RUN On Sunday,6th. Hay, the newly formed R.O.S.

Obviously unfit, they could not\naccelerate sufficiently when approached by a Polios mastiff.\nThis worthy animal pinned the Guildsman to the ground by his\nshoulder until ita flat-footed master arrived to.explain the\nfolly of training after a heavy supper. The A.C.C. will be\nrelieved to hear that no court action has ensued.\nSPANNER RETURNED: The larger portion of the spanner, wh i oh had\nbeen in the manganate stained hands of R.C.S., was left looked\nin the notice board in the Beit Archway an Wednesday night.

A bucket of beer will probably be used for\nthis purpose and it is hoped to have television newsreel cameras\npresent. Any similarity to the christening of 'Clementine' is purely coincidental.\nHIDE PARK ATTRACTIONS:\nWeek before last:\nLast week:\nNext week:\nWeek after next:\nMethodist Youth Rally\nSt. John's Ambulance Brigade\nSheep Dog Trials\nField Cup\nA combination of all four would be even more interesting.\nBEATING THE BOUNDS: As dawn broke over Silwood Park last Saturday morning, a group of revellers, using a band cart as a chariot, and ringing<a bell vigorously,' beat the bounds to\nscare away the evil spirits. Shortly after an early cuckoo\nwas heard.\nTO SERVE A DEMAND, a new bus route has been introduced to\ntake students away from the Island'sight!

Comment by Bedford lady, watching pro-oe sei on of decorated floats - \"What about I.C.?* We must do\nsomething about entering a float next year.
