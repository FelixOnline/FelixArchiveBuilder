Forgive me if I give\nthe impression of being a little over enthusiastic\nbut as Ents did not make the substantial profit\nanticipated this time last year, we want to convince the maximum number of gullible FRESHERS\nhow worthwhile it will be to come to all of them.\nFreshers' Hop this\nSaturday features Fairport Convention. The\nlineup of the group is\nuncertain at the time of\nwriting but rumours are\nafoot that some of the\nformer members who\nleft will be returning for\nthis concert. Be sure\nyou can all groove along,\nhave a good stomp and\nshow off your trendy\nclothes you haven't worn in London yet.\nEven if you bury your\nhead in books for the\nrest of the year, don't miss this one \u2014 we\nneed your money.\nOctober 14th sees\nDHS-One at the college.\nThis new group features\nDick Heckstall - Smith\nformerly of Colosseum\nand this fact alone\nshould be enough to\npack out the Great Hall.\nIf you can't decide to\ncome or not, play Colosseum's 'Valentine Suite'\nat 45 r.p.m. \u2014 second\nthoughts it sounds even\nbetter at the right speed.\nThis will bias you.\nNo jokes about October 21 st's concert, folks\nit's the Phantom of Rock\nLou Reed whose first\n'solo' album received\nrave reviews from most\nof pop's intellectuals\nand whose role in the\nVelvet Underground is\nlegendary. Who knows?\nHe may play \"Heroin\"\nor even \"Sister Rag\",\nbut even if he doesn't it should be an historic\nevening.\nThere will be an old-fashioned teeny - bop -style hop on October\n28th, hopefully in the\nUnion. Anyone who saw\nthem last term will testify that they're a good\nband to shake your ass\nto. There should be a disco as well. Then it's back to heavies for the\nnext three weeks. On\nNovember 4th we have\nStatus Quo who we believe (and hope) are\nphenomenally popular on\nthe \"musically inept but\ngood to move to\" circuit.\" I'm looking forward to it,\" says Dude\nRavers (Elec. Eng. IV).\nOsibisa play on November 11th and as with Roy\nYoung, no one who saw\nthem last year will want\nto miss the \"criss-cross\nrhythms that explode\nwith happiness.\"\nThe word is out for\nGenesis. By the time\nthey play the Great Hall\non November 18th their\nnew album \"Foxtrot\"\nwill be out and they will\nbe one of Britain's great\nnew discoveries. The\nlead singer is believed\n(and I quote) to make\nDavid Bowie and Alice\nCooper look like last\nyear's tat. Ooh! Cheeky\nbitch. The rest of the\ngroup make good music,\nby the way, but of\ncourse that's of secondary importance these\ndays.\nBelieve me, it's not\neasy writing ps eudy crap\nlike the above. I shall\nfinish by stating that\nother groups proposed\nfor later this term include Argent, Brett Marvin and the Dinosaurs\n(sorry Terry Dactyl and\nthe Thunderbolts) and\nthe Kinks. Look out for\nEnts posters for details. Mike as he appeared at a1969 Union General Meeting\nbe colour,\nbut. . .\nContrary to the expectations of your department during your College life, you will not want\nto study all the time. Freshers' Fair gives you\nthe chance to join many clubs and societies for\nrecreation and sport, but you will also want to be\nentertained and kept informed about College and\nUnion affairs. As well as Felix, another student\n\"organ of communication\" exists. Imperial College Union has been wise enough to finance its\nown television service: Student Television of Imperial College.\nSTOIC complements\nthe broadcast channels\nby presenting films, magazine programmes and\nnews for IC students\nalone. It's not just neighbourhood TV though, for\non STOIC you can see\nprogrammes from other\ncolleges and offbeat\ncommercial films of student interest.\nHere is the programme schedule\u2014the\nweeks alternate.\nThis week:\nTuesday 12.30 p.m.: Popular feature film\nseries, to include \"Goal\"\n(1966 World Cup) and\nthe \"Carry On\" series.\nFriday 1.00 p.m.: The ever popular Monochrome show. Producer\nTim Jeffs intends to\ngive you the inside story\nof entertainment and the\narts, adding contributions from the Royal College of Arts School of\nFilm and Television and\nthe BBC to STOIC interviews with musicians\nand o the i guests horn\nthe film and TV world.\nFriday 6.05 p.m.: Repeat of the ever popular Monochrome Show.\nNext week:\nTuesday 1.00 p.m. London Survival : ac-com mod ation. STOIC investigates the student\nsituation. Producer Graham Foster examines all\nthe alternatives and\nwarns of shady practices; are you satisfied?\nFurther programme titles\nare Entertainment, with\n\"Time Out\", editor Tony\nElliott, and How to Pass\nExams.\nFriday 1.00 p.m. Topic: STOIC'S news\nmagazine programme in\nwhich producer Cathy\nGee gives you filmed reports of Union and College events, plus interviews with people behind Felix's headlines.\nFriday 6.05 p.m.: Repeat of Topic.\nWhere can you watch\nSTOIC? Well, the service is relayed on channel 21 UHF to all TV\nsets in Southside, both\nthe Union lounges and\nthe halls of residence.\nIt is also shown on a TV\nmonitor in the Junior\nCommon Room in College Block.\nI hope you enjoy the\nprogrammes; if you do\nnot, then constructive\nsuggestions are not just\nwelcome, but essential,\nif we are to provide a truly tailor-made student\nservice.\nIn case you were wondering.\nWho' s WHO? The Art of Mascotry might well appear to those reappearing here after the summer to have died a quite\nnatural death many moons ago. Perhaps it is to the\nbest that this should have happened, unless you are\nyourself a keen mascotte er. However, it would seem\nthat, since this article has been submitted, that some\nof the old spirit lingers on; and in the hope that someone amongst the fresher s might be interested to read\nof the history of IC mascot ry, and also because we\nare desperate to fill up space, the article has been\nprinted in full:\nOnce upon a time (well\nall good stories begin that\nway) before Imperial College was a glint in the\nPrince Consort's eye, there\nwere two colleges, the\nRoyal College of Chemistry in Oxford Street, and\nthe Museum of Practical\nGeology in Jermyn Street.\nAnd it came to pass\n\u2022that in 1872 the Government School of Mining\nand Science Applied to\nthe Arts acquired very\ncheaply a building in\nExhibition Road built for\nthe Royal School of\nNaval Architects in a style which appears to be\na cross between a palace\nand a battleship, and this\nbecame the embryo of\nI.C. But even when joined\nin Kensington by the\nCentral Technical College\nto form the Imperial College of Science and\nTechnology, the colleges\nretained their own souls\neven if grafted with a new body, and those\nsouls did have an earthly\nform which, after re in car nation, appeared in modern times as a thermo-meter, a Davy lamp and\na spanner.\n\u2022Not content with one\nmascot each, the students\nof the colleges, who by\nthis time had found better\nthings to do than science,\nmining or engineering,\ncontinuously tried to borrow each others'. The\ngentlemen (??\u2014Ed.) of\nthe RCS however did\nmuch better than either\nGuilds or Mines who\neventually gave up, and\nthe RCS Wooden Horse\nClub became the Imperial\nCollege Wooden Horse\nOrganisation (or WFIO\nfor short). And the members of WHO started borrowing the mascots of\nother London colleges.\nWe still have somewhere\n(I believe) an Anchor\nthat once glowed in the\ncolours of the University\nCollege and a ceramic\nOwl of unknown ante ce dents.\nBut these colleges,\nrightfully, started complaining because WHO\nwas pinching their mascots right, left and centre,\nand had nothing of its\nown to guard.\nMany years before, IC\n'had boasted a mascot . . .\na Phoenix called Herbert\n(well, what would YOU call a phoenix?) after\nwhich that well-known\nliterary (sic) magazine\n\"The Phoenix\" was\nnamed.\nAnd this bird sat peacefully on its shelf until the\n\"Herbs\" (its keepers\u2014\nRIP) were seduced by the\nlittle people . . . in the\nform of a couple of wenches from some teacher\ntraining college.\nDetermined to save the\nnext mascot from so ignoble a fate, the Union\nchose Colcutt's tower to\nreplace Herbert. Surely a tower with 60ft. piling was\nalmost un steal able? In the meantime, the\nRifle Club had been saving its spent cartridge\ncases and had sufficient to\nmanufacture a new totem\n. . . a giant micrometer\nscrew gauge. Designed in\nR.C.S., cast in Mines and\nmachined in Guilds'\n\"MIKE\" was the finest\nmascot in all London . . .\nnay, Great Britain. The\ntask of safeguarding it\nwas entrusted to the\nElectrical Engineers.\nWithin a few weeks Mike\nwas violated, taken to\nUniversity College, and set\nin a block of ferro concrete. It was retrieved and\nguarded. It spent some\ntime in exile in a bank\nvault up in the North\nwhile a fool (and student)\nproof defence system was\ndevised.\nIt was replaced in the\nUnion Lower Lounge on\na plinth. It stayed safe behind its steel clasps for a couple of weeks and was\nthen violated again . . .\nthis time by Queen Mary\nCollege. Realising that to\ntry and solve the problems of the multitudinous\nAssa locks and combinations was futile, they \"lib-e rated\" Mike using a cold\nchisel and a sledge ham-mer.\nI await the return of\nMike, mascot ry and a \"sporting spirit\" to I.C. \u2014\nthings that are epi tomis ed by the words of the college chant:\nHe Vivo\nHe Vivo\nHe Vivo Vivo Vo\nHe Efte Efte, Ho Ho\nEfte,\nIngo Ingo Ho Ho Ho\nrepeated twice and then\nIC, IC, IC (what a literary\nmasterpiece\u2014Ed.).\nAnybody interested in\nMascotry should leave a note in the Union Rack\nfor WHO.\nM "

This project has since met with\nsomewhat mixed success.\nIt was extremely successful in that it provided\nterm-time ac com moda for 58 students at moderate rents, however, empty\nrooms during the vacation and general mismanagement produced a deficit of the order of\n\u00a31,600 at the end of the\nyear.\nThis figure comprised\nthe \u00a31,000 surplus budgeted for, together with a \u00a3600 loss on electricity\u2014\nhence, it can be seen that\nthe rent money received\njust covered the cost of\nthe lease. In fairness to\nthe original controllers of\nthe project, it should be\nemphasised that the lease\nwas acquired only two\nweeks before the start of\nthe Autumn term\u2014some\nof the previous residents\nnot vacating the premises\nuntil the first day of\nterm \u2014 leaving very\nlittle time for any real\nconsideration of the problems likely to arise. As a direct result of this, two\nmajor problems arose.\nOne was the question of\nmaintenance. Nobody at\nCollege seemed to be familiar with the terms of the\nlease as far as internal\nrepairs were concerned,\nwith the result that some\nThe\nHamlet\nGardens\nStory\nitems were eventually\npassed on to the land-lords, London Property\nServices, who sometimes\nattended to them \u2014 to\ntheir own standards!\nOther complaints were\nlost in the depths of the\nUnion Office, indeed, examinations of the files reveals that a shower first\nreported in October was\nstill defective in April,\nafter no fewer than four\nseparate written requests\nfor. action. The second\nproblem was the reverse\nof the first in that it did\nnot affect the residents of\nthe flats, but the College\nwho were responsible for\ncollecting rent and paying\nthe fuel bills. This bungle\nwas not uncovered until\nMarch when the College\nreceived gas and elect ri city, via London Propetry\nServices \u2014 nobody had\nbothered to inform the\nrespective Boards that\nImperial College now\nheld the lease. No gas\nbill had been expected as\nall flats were thought to\ncontain pre-payment meters emptied by the Board\ndirect, however, three\nflats had quarterly non-slot meters, hence the\nbills. Each room in the\nflats was fitted with a prepayment electricity meter,\nsome of which had locks,\nand some of which\nworked. These were emptied periodically by Lewis\nand Lewis Ltd., the land-lord's agents, who invaded\nall the rooms they could\nwith their master keys \u2014\nCollege failed to propose\nany alternative means of\ncollection. Not surprisingly the total monies recovered from the meters\nfailed to meet the bill \u2014\nthe difference being some\n\u00a3600. It should also be\nmentioned that no prepayment meters controlled\nthe power supplying the\ncorridor in each flat, nor\nthe immersion heaters in\nsome. This latter deficit\nwas followed by an un-savoury attempt to recoup\nthe loss by billing each\nflat's residents equally for\na sum based only on the\noverall deficit for that\nflat, with no account\nwhatsoever being taken of\nmoney paid into individual room meters. I am\npleased to report that the\nthreat of legal action\nagainst the students concerned has now been\nwithdrawn.\nAt the time of writing\nthe question of the lease\nfor the 72/73 session has\nnot been resolved. The\nlandlords asked for an increase of 20% on the\nprice of the lease, but\ncareful negotiating on the\npart of the Domestic\nBursar, Mr. Seaford, has\neffectively imposed a10% ceiling on any rise.\nIndeed, the Union has\neven offered to take an\nadditional property to\nease the Landlords' losses\ndue to vacant premises;\nthe latter were, of course,\nto have been offered to\nthe Union, but at a rather\nhigher price than it looks\nas though we shall now\nhave to pay.\nIn case you had not not-iced, the cost of accommodation is going up at anything but an idle rate. The\nUSK lodgings bureau, run\nin the Union Office, is\nfinding it quite difficult to\nplace students at prices\nthey can afford. There are\nmany reasons for this,\nthough perhaps the main\nreason was put in the Sunday Times Colour Supplement during the vacation\nwhich said that an older\nperson is to be found\nnowadays sharing a flat.\nThese people can afford\nto pay more than \u00a36 a week which is the maximum most students can\nafford to pay, and so students find it more difficult\nto find accommodation.\nThe increase in flat prices\nis not in isolation from\nother rises in prices of\ntransport and food. The\nfact is that the grant increases is far behind the\nparity with various price\nindices that it is supposed\nto be calculated from. A. recent NUS publication\nput the spending power of\nthe grant down by at least\n10 per cent on its 1962\nlevel. What can be done\nto change this situation?\nIn January NUS asked\nthe DES for an interim\ngrant increase. No, was\nthe answer. In June the\nUniversity Vice-Chancellors got a similar reply. All\nthis was from an organisation headed by Van Straubenzee who, when in opposition, had uttered that\nstudents grants were an\nMaking\nEnds\nMeet\nitem of expenditure that\nthe country could not afford to shirk! Of course,\nas was said at ULU last\nNovember, if he asks the\nExchequer for more money for education he may\nbe laughed at and down\nwould go his estimation in\nthe eyes of his toady Tory\ncolleagues.\nIf he is afraid of his\nstanding in his own party\nthe views of his colleagues\nmust be made favourable\nto the cause of a grants\nincrease. A letter to your\nMP outlining your financial difficulties will bring\nthe problem to his at ten tion. Even better, go and\nsee him at the House of\nCommons\u2014you may even\nget free tea! There are\nmany ideas floating about\non how more money can\nbe made available for stu-ents at University\u2014one of\nthem is loans. Make sure\nyou have your answers\nready to counter this suggestion. Last year much Union\ntime was spent on discussing the freedom of Student\nUnions. This, though im-port ant, was magnified out\nof all proportion as it was\nin reality a battle of bur-eau cr a cie s. This year the\nbattle is going to be over\nthe financing of the individual student and his\nright to choose where and\nwhat he studies. There\nshould be no incentives to\nmake a student live at\nhome in order to make\nends meet and people who\nwant to study art or drama\nshould get the same financing as students in science\nas both are equally important to society. Most important however is that\nthe student grant should\nbe brought up to a level\nwhere he can get good accommodation with study\nfacilities, good food and\nfinally money so that he\nhas an opportunity to develop interests, broaden\nhis interests and meet\npeople.\nContact your MP and\nask him how to exist on\n\u00a3480 for 31 weeks in London and 21 weeks in some\nother part of the country.\nPerhaps if you gave him\na Mooney . . .\nThe NUS legal department is always very busy\nFELDC\n* REPORTERS\n* FEATURE WRITERS* SPORTS REPORTERS* FilM CRSTSC\n* MUSIC REVIEWER* CLASS' CAL RECORD REVIEWER* SUB EDITORS* LAYOUT ARTISTS* TEAVAKE9S\n* CARTOONIST(S)* PHOTOGRAPHERS* ADVERTISEMENT REPRESENTATIVES\nBelieve it cr not, we have at present no\nmore than eight regular \"Felix\" contributors . . end we need YOU to help.\nThe job *s rewarding ?\"d, let's be hon-est, can be hard work.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX 2nd October, 1972\nT HE prospect of having a Presidential election in only three\nweeks' time is frightening in\nsome respects, and welcome\nin others. It is welcome in that\nthere will now be some real action\nin the first term (and FELIX will have\nsome news to print). Those of you who\nare new to Imperial College will have\nthe chance to see at first hand how our\nsystem operates, instead of waiting with\nbated breath and eager anticipation for\nMarch. In fact, you will all have the\nfun of having two elections in the same\nyear, and it is almost certain that the\nsecond will be the most interesting.\nThe frightening part of it is trying to\nfigure out who will stand for the post.\nIt is too early for rumours, and indeed\ntoo late also, for the nomination forms\nare now up. Last year's election of\nChris Sheppard was almost a foregone\nconclusion. The only opponents were\na Socialist Society candidate (who\nmanaged to get a quite respectable\nnumber of votes, but probably only because he managed to conceal very\ncarefully that he was a SocSoc can di date) and two complete outsiders. This\ntime it is impossible to predict at this\nstage any candidate of the \"old school\"\n(alias the McCullough - Sheppard\nLiberal Party) who is likely to stand.\nOne can be fairly certain that SocSoc\nEDITORIAL\nwill put up a candidate, and it is quite\nreadily conceivable that either he (or\nshe) could get in. It might be a very\ninteresting year. . .\nIT is not a vintage year for accommodation. You might well be regretting that you ever came here,\nand didn't take up that option on\na place at a university in the Hebrides\nor wherever. Nevertheless, it would\nprobably have been the same story\nthere. The only places with no accommodation problem are those colleges\nlike Royal Holloway which have compulsory 100 per cent hall accommodation at \u00a3210 per annum all in. You\nmight also be surprised to hear that,\nafter Royal Holloway, Imperial has\nthe lowest hall fees in London University. That does not solve the problem.\nThis year the 3,000 of you who cannot be put up in IC accommodation\nwill have to pay more than \u00a36 a week\nfor your room only in furthest sub ur bia. It is more than a problem to find\naccommodation even at higher prices\nthan that. There are few solutions to\nthe problem. Putting up the grant ona\ncost-of-living basis is surely the best\nfrom our point of view. However, the\nbasis would have to be a special index\nfor students, since the cost of accommodation here has been going up at a far faster rate than the ordinary cost-of-living index. Whether this would\nsolve the problem in the long run,\nthough, is dubious . . . prices would\nprobably rise faster than before.\nThe government has hit upon a very\nsimple scheme for them to operate. It\nwould undoubtedly solve the problem\nin the long run, but in the process\nwould not only destroy the concept of\na university, but alienate still further\nstudents from the government . . . and,\nfor once, their parents too.\nI am referring to the home-based\nstudents plan. The government has\nasked the Vice-Chancellors to give preference to students who would live at\nhome during the academic year. If the\nsystem is accepted and becomes uni-versa l, everyone would go to their local\nuniversity, and presumably even the\nhalls would become redundant. One\npresumes that the usual exceptions for\nmedical schools and Oxford and Cambridge would apply.\nThe best alternative is to build\nenough halls of residence to accommodate everybody. This is by no means as\nsilly as it sounds. If the government\nwill not cough up the money (and nobody supposes that they will), the\nclearing banks will probably only be\ntoo keen to. The halls would thus be\nbuilt on a system of \"loan finance\".\nThe new Northside hall at IC is being\nbuilt on this financing system. Since\nthe college owns the land here, it may\nas well build as much as possible on\nthe space available, and then make the\nnumber of places up to the required\nnumber (by the time it could come\naround it would probably be 6,000\nplaces) by building out in the country . . . for example, on some of the\nspare (and cheap) land around Heathrow Airport, which is very easily accessible from I.C. Everyone will have to\nswallow their objections to travelling\na distance and to loan finance. It's worth making sacrifices to solve the\naccommodation problem.\nYou all know that you are now a member of Imperial College Union. You will rapidly find out, if you haven't already, that\nyou are also a member of your constituent college union \u2014 Royal College of Science, City and Guilds' College or Royal School\nof Mines Union. But it doesn't end there. You are also automatically a member of the National Union of Students and the University of London Union. So what? Read on and find out \u00bb . .\nBy the end of this week,\nall you freshmen will have\nbeen (we hope) well and\ntruly indoctrinated into\nImperial College Union.\nHaving spent many a happy hour at the Freshers' Fair, the Union Reception Evening, departmental receptions et al,\nand having drunk your fill\nof Mooney sherry at the\nreception meetings organised by those dozens of\nclubs that you joined at\nthe Fair, you might well\nshy away from the idea of\ngoing to another Freshers'\nFair.\nThe one that we're talking about is the University\nof London Union one. Believe it or not, besides\nbeing a member of Imperial College Union, your\nconstituent college union,\nthe National Union of Students, you are also a member of ULU.\nWell, so what IS ULU?\nFor a start, it's an enormous building in Malet\nStreet, WC1. right by the\nSenate House (the administrative centre of London\nUniversity), which forms a meeting place for students\nfrom all the constituent\ncolleges that make up the\nUniversity. At the mo-ment, it is relatively unfrequented by Imperial\nCollege students, probably\nbecause it is quite a distance away, but repays a visit, if only because you\nmay as well take advantage of everything that you\ncan get free . . .there's not\nvery much in London!\nULU runs a large number of sports and social\nclubs. Its sports clubs are\ngenerally for sportsmen of\nvery high standard to\ncompete in inter-university\ncompetitions, but they\nalso do have clubs for be-g inner s, especially in those\nsports which constituent\ncollege unions do not offer.\nSo, if either you're a top-notch sportsman, or want\nto start in some sport\nwhich we don't do here\nat IC, go along to UL U and find out about it\nthere.\nThe social clubs include\nall the usual ones, like\nChess and Transcendental\nMeditation, but especially\ncater for our international\nfriends here in national\nsocieties.\nWhat else is there at\nULU? Well, there's a very\ngood (and inexpensive) restaurant which operates\njust about all day (and so\nit's very handy for a bite\nif you're up in Central\nLondon), a bar (in ev it ably!), common rooms, a TV lounge, music rooms\n(with massive selection of\nrecords and all the equip-ment), etc, etc. And of\ncourse the meeting rooms\nfor all the societies (now\nincluding the LSPA).\nThe best way of finding\nout what ULU offers is to\ngo along and see for your-self. They are running a \"Freshers' Fair\" (oh no,\nnot. another!!) next Monday and Tuesday, 9th and\n10th October, at which\nevery club and society will\nbe represented. There'll\neven be rowing and canoeing demonstrations in the\nswimming pool (anything\nfor a laugh).\nSo why not go along?\nYou've nothing to lose except your 15p tube fare (to\nGoodge Street or Russell\nSquare) and not only\nshould you find out what\nhappens there, but meet\nsome of your colleagues\nfrom other colleges (there\nare also rather more\nwomen there than there\nare at IC!!)\nBeing honest, the National Union of Students is\nreally a political union.\nImperial College Union\nisn't. Unfortunately, the\nchances are that even if\nyou're politically minded,\nthe NUS's politics will not\nbe compatible with your\nown, but you will have to\nfind this out for yourself.\nAt the moment the executive is on a \"Communist\"\nticket, whatever that may\nmean, but, needless to say\nof a union claiming to\nrepresent 51)0,000 very different students, there are\nmany factions within it.\nYou will hear enough of\nthe NUS's politics when\nthe November National\nConference at Margate\ncomes around, so until\nthen the subject can lie.\nWhat functions do the\nNUS perform?\nOperating from a derelict terrace house in Endsleigh Street, the NUS has\nalmost ceased to organise\n\"demonstrations\" as such:\nthe new term is \"Day of\nAction\". The next one, if\nyou like that sort of thing,\nis the \"Day of Action on\nEducation\" on October\n28th.( \"Felix\" will carry\nfull details on October\n24th). The NUS operates many\nservices. The best known\nare the Travel Service and\nEndsleigh Insurances. Both\nof these operate in competition with commercial\nconcerns. The travel service operates and organises\ncharter flights to all parts\nof the world throughout\nthe holiday seasons at\nheart-breaking (if you're a scheduled carrier) prices.\nNot only flights, but trains,\nboats and coaches as well.\nIt's probably safe to say\nthat wherever you have a desire to go, NUS Travel\nService can fix you up, at\nincredibly low cost.\nEndsleigh Insurances\nLtd. is a subsidiary company of the NUS, and\noperates as an insurance\nbrokerage. That is, they\nwill ring round all the insurance companies for\nquotes for whatever kind\nof insurance you want,\nand offer you the best (or\ncheapest) to suit your\nneeds. They also have special schemes for students\nfor certain kinds of in sur ance, for example motor\ninsurance, travel insurance\nand property insurance.\nThe NUS has a very\nbusy legal department\nwhich can advise you free\nof charge on any legal\nmess that you might get\nyourself into. There is a scheme for legal aid\nthrough NUS too. The\nNational Union of Students can indeed advise\nyou on everything that will\naffect you during your\ncareer as a student, with\nthe notable and obvious\nexception of telling you\nhow to pass your exams.\nOther important departments arc those dealing\nwith grants and accommodation problems.\nBesides all these ser-vices, your NUS card also\nentitles you to substantial\ndiscounts at many stores\nand organisations, especially in London. The \"Dis-count Directory\" is published annually price 18p, and you can consult a copy in the Union Office.\nHaven't, got your NUS\ncard yet? Well, you're entitled to it, so take a passport photo of yourself\nalong to the IC Union\nOffice and they'll issue you\none.\nNational Union of Students of the United Kingdom, 3 Endsleigh Street,\nLondon, WC1.\n\n"

Eng.\n2 proposed by\u2014yes,\nyou've guessed it\u2014\nIan Mackenzie. The\nconclusion of the\ncampaign saw Chris\nSheppard elected President by a very\nsubstantial majority,\nalong with Martin C. Black Esq., secretary\n(also a sabbatical\npost) and Paul Jowitt,\ndeputy president. So\nfar so good.\nThen, at the beginning of the Summer\nterm, Mr. Sheppard\nshook the world (or\nat least the Union\nOffice) by announcing\nthat he was withdrawing from his\nexams. He asked an\nIC Union meeting to\npass a motion letting\nhim still take up office\nas President. His motion was defeated, as\nICU policy is that\nany sabbatical officer\nshould either be qualified to proceed to the\nnext year of his/her\ncourse, or have just\ncompleted a degree.\nSo Chris Sheppard\nresigned and left a 'hole' of gargantuan\nproportions at the top\nof ICU's super st ruc ture.\nThe first course of\naction, i.e.a new ele c tion, was ruled out as\nthe exam season was\nalmost there, so\nCouncil decided in\nfavour of electing an\nActing President, as\nallowed for in the\nconstitution, the\nlucky person being\u2014\ns hh, you know who,\nIan Mackenzie.\nThe post of Acting\nPresident runs from\nAugust 1st to November 1st, when a new President will\nhave been elected.

This is a new\nassociation formed by leading London student\nnewspapers designed to promote co-operation\nbetween papers and their staffs and to help us all\nproduce better newspapers.

    "content": "October 2, 1972 FELIX Page 3\nFor a four week season only, it's Ian Mackenzie's President's Piece\nThe beginning of the Academic year, a time when everyone writes articles starting\nwith 'Welcome to Imperial College' (Whoops,\ndone it again!) is a good time to have a look at\nImperial College Union as a whole.\nI know that when I came to IC (a long time\nago), I had an idea of\nwhat the Union would be\nlike. Of course, it would\nrun a large number of\nclubs and societies, and be\ninvolved in \"behind the\nscenes\" furthering student\ninterests; it would hold debates on current affairs;\nit would arrange dances\nand discos. But above all,\nit would provide a sense\nof belonging to the Union.\nUnfortunately, this doesn't often materialise,\nand it's easy after a while\nto accept the standard excuses that \"we're a highly\ntechnical, high workload\ncollege\", \"we've go no arts\npeople\", \"we've got precious few girls\". In one\nword what we have got is\nAPATHY.\nICU has progressed tremendously in the last three\nyears over specific issues\nsuch as representation on\ncollege committees, or\nbroadening of purely technical courses, but perhaps\nthe biggest step, to get a more tangible community\nspirit, is still to be made.\nThis in turn would foster\na greater involvement in\nspecific issues.\nWell, what's so different\nabout ICU this year?\nWhat's the catalyst needed\nfor this change?\nUnion Building\nTo get a Union that\neveryone feels part of, you\nneed a Union building that\nis \"the place to go\",\nwhether you want to watch\nTV or meet people. We\nhave an excellent Union\nbuilding which has been\ngreatly underused these\nlast few years. Attempts\nto reverse this have come\nand gone but with the\nwholesale re decoration and\nrefitting this summer, it's the best chance yet.\nOn the ground floor\n(which should be open by\nthe start of term) there's the Union bar with fully-equipped extension, the\nlower lounge and the\nUnion refectory (open 10-6). If we can get an Evening Snack Bar going then\nit's already an ideal social\ncentre. The Union Dining\nRoom and TV lounge are\non the first floor, while\nthe \"Room at the Top\" is\nto be (when completed on\n23rd October) a new information centre on tra-vel, insurance, Union ser-vices, student counselling,\netc. So if you want a pie,\na pint or abu mph sheet\n. . . go to the Union!\nCommunications\nThis year, we've got a weekly Felix for the first\ntime, an improved student\ntelevision service (S.T.O.I.C.), and there's a possibility of starting up a campus radio, as well as\nthe information centre,\nso there should be no excuse for not knowing\nwhat's on!\nUSK\nNot new, but growing\nall the time! There are\nseveral colleges of varying sorts in the West London area in USK, a good\nmany of them having a large majority of girls, so\ngo along to their Union\n. . . and invite them along\nto ours!\nSo whether you're a newcomer, or not, ask\nyourself now what you expect ICU to be \u2014 then\nask yourself if it is. Better\nstill, bring your ideas to\nthe IC Union Office, Beit\nArchway (Int. tel. 2488)\nany time. And don't forget the Union meeting to-morrow, Great Hall, 1.15\nGet yourself\ninto shape\nSUK\nfor your studies\nwith books and\nstationery from the\nI.C. BOOKSHOP\nThis will be the second\nRag Week this year, as\nthe 72-73 Rag Week will\nbe in November. Because\nof the early date, the rag\norganisation must start\nearly. The first meeting\nof the term will be held\non Tuesday, 3rd October\nat 7.30 p.m. in Committee\nRoom A( just off the\nLower Lounge in the\nUnion Building) and, of\ncourse, anyone is welcome\nto attend.\nRAG\nOur ideas for stunts include dressing up as\npigeons and going to feed\nthe tourists in Trafalgar\nSquare, and the traditional ones such as the\ntiddlywinks race down\nOxford Street will take\nplace. There will also\nbe, as usual, a procession\nand raffles. Some of these\nevents are well on the way\ntowards being organised\u2014\nothers need help. We also\nneed someone who can\nspell to help the chairman\n(hear, hear\u2014Ed.).\nNEEDS\nWe would particularly\nlike your help with the\norganisation of discos and\ngigs, the rag mag, and a dik shun n airy for the chairman (he's done it again!\u2014\nEd.). We need people with\nideas, however insane\nthey might be (like trying\nto break into the Bank of\nEngland vaults with a12 foot (3.78 metres) can\nopener?).\nYOUR Even if you have no\nideas and are not interested in rag mags or ents.\nwe can still find something\nfor you to do. So if you\nare interested in doing\nsomething (or have just\ngot nothing to do?) this\nTuesday or any other\nTuesday, please do come\nalong to the Rag meeting.\nThey're very informal\n(leave your clothes at\nhome) and great fun for\nall is promised. You\nshouldn't be able to miss\nthe signs to the meeting\n. . . if you have, why not\ndraw some new ones for\nus? Hope to see you there.\nSUPPORT\nAssociated\nStudies\n\"Associated Studies\" may sound pretty\nboring to you, and indeed totally revolting to\nthose of you who are Electrical Engineers, but\nit is the title given to some surprisingly in-interesting lunchtime lectures being given during the first two terms of the year by various\ndistinguished people on a wide variety of\ntopics (most of which, I am glad to say, have\nnothing whatever to do with science or tech-no logy). These lectures have, in\nfact, been a long-standing\nfeature of Tuesday and\nThursday lunchtimes in\nImperial College.

Don't let us get away\nwithout printing the Sports Page. There will, however,\nonly be a Sports Page if those sports people amongst you\nget your collective finger out and get the Editor some copy\nby Friday 1100 hrs at latest. Photos, too, if you've got\nthem, please. Please don't write more than 1,000 words\nper article unless you have advance clearance.\nHow about you social clubs too? Like chess, gliding,\nModel Aircraft, Astrosoc, J Soc, YHA, etc., etc.??? If you\ndo things, we've got room to print something about you\n. . . not necessarily on this page, but on another perhaps.\nRing the Editor and have a chat about how YOU can\nbe included in FELIX . . . internal phone 2488.\nBeen registered\nlately ?\nqui red by law to enter the\nnames of all those who are\nnormally resident at that\nplace on 10th October.\nThe law permits a person\nto be registered in more\nthan one place, e.g. his\nparents' home and his college address, although, of\ncourse, he may only vote\nonce in any election. Thus\nyou can vote once only in\ngeneral elections, but in\nboth places in the case of\nlocal elections. You should\ntherefore be registered at\nyour lodgings address in\nLondon, and also at your\nhome address (if different).\nIn case you missed out,\nor got missed out, you can\ngo to the local post office\non November 28th or\nthereafter and consult the\nproposed register. If your\nname is not on it, it is not\nYou might well be\ntotally bored with poli-tics, but nevertheless,\nshould a general election\nbe called, most of you\nwould probably like to\nvote. After all you may\nas well . . . it's no good\ncomplaining about who's got in if you haven't voted.\nWell, now is the time to\nregister to be permitted to\nvote in the coming year.\nEven if there isn'ta general election (and, let's face it, it's very unlikely)\nthere will definitely be\nlocal elections coming up.\nCome October 10th, a form code-named \"Form\nA.\" will be distributed to\nall householders (this includes landladies and Hall\nwardens). They are re-too late to have this situ-a tion changed, but you\nmust inform the local Electoral Registration Officer\nof the details by December 16th. As you must all know,\nany British subject over\nthe age of eighteen is entitled to vote. However, if\nyou are not yet eighteen,\nbut will be before 15th February, 1974, your name\nmust be included on the\nRegister.\nSo check that your Hall\nwarden or landlady puts\nyour own personal form\u2014\nwhen it arrives.

The dishes that we will be featuring are quite inexpensive (compared to going out and eating it) provided that you can con several\nother people into helping you eat it. . . it's very uneconomic to cook like this for\nless than 3 people. So given this basic requirement, a couple of spare hours and the\ndesire to poison yourself, you too can enjoy the wonders of\nBoeuf Bourg u in on ne Ingredients: (for four people)\n2 oz Lard or Butter or Marg.\n1 medium onion, chopped\n5 oz pack of Frozen Peas\n\\\\ lbs Stewing Steak\nVery small can Tomato Puree\npt (at least I) red wine\n4 oz flour\nBlack Pepper\nTeaspoon mixed herbs (Italian\nSeasoning)\nBeef stock cube\n8 oz Patna-type rice\nTeaspoonjul salt\nWater \\\nMethod\nTake either a7 in. or\nbigger saucepan or an 8\nin. fry pan, and wash it up\nfrom last time you used it.\nSorry, you'll have to get\nrid of all that bacon fat\nyou've been lovingly preserving in your fry pan for\nthe last three years . . .\nwe need it CLEAN.

About 20 minutes\nbefore the meal is due to\nbe ready, start cooking the\nrice. If you are vaguely\neastern, or have eastern\ntraining, or happen to have\nan eastern origin friend,\nyou won't need me to tell\nyou how to cook rice. If\nyou can't cook rice without it going stodgy\nthough, as I couldn't this\ntime last year, it's best\nreally to tr,y the English\nmethod. To do this, fill up\na big enough (probably\n7in. or bigger) saucepan to\nwithin an inch or two of\nthe top with water, add a teaspoonful of salt, and\nbring to the boil. When it\nis boiling, \"rain\" the rice\ninto the water, so that it\nnever goes off the boil.\nThen boil the rice as\nfiercely as you can without\nboiling yourself as well\nuntil it's cooked. This\nshould take between 12\n15 minutes . . . after 12\nminutes, keep testing the\nrice. When it is cooked to\nyour satisfaction, fill up\nthe saucepan to brim-full\nwith COLD water and\nleave for a minute or two.\nThen drain off the water\nand, hey presto . . . soggy\nrice again ! (It should be\nfluffy, actually . . . it works\nfor me!).\nNow for the moment of\ntruth when you serve it up\n. . . and wait to find out\nwhat everyone else thinks\nof it. (NB speaking from\nexperience of cooking this\nin a student house last year\n. . . you had better guard\nthe dish all the time that\nit's cooking, otherwise you\nwon't have any left to\neat!).\nCost: roughly 30p per\nhead.\nWe hope that you enjoy\nit . . . if you don't, write\nand tell us why. And why\ndon't you contribute your\nfavourite recipe . . . however simple or complicated\nit is, no matter, as long as\nit can be cooked without\ntoo much difficulty on a Hall galley-type stove.

I am pleased to announce, therefore, Zappa\nfreaks everywhere, that this album almost lives up to its subtitle \"Hot Rats\nPart 2\".\n\" Waka/ Jaw aka\" is\nin part a step back in\nthe direction of \"Hot\nRats\" in that two of\nthe tracks, the title\nsong and \" Big Swifty\"\nare ten-minute-plus in-s tru mental s. The difference is that while\ntracks of this length on\n\"Hot Rats\" generally\ntook the form of\ntheme-solo-theme the\nRECORDS\nsubdivisions here are\nconsiderably more subtle. \" Big Swifty\"\nwhich occupies the\nwhole of the first side\nbegins with rapid exchanges between Sal\nMarques' multi-tracked\ntrumpet and you-know-who's guitar, before\nsettling down to some\nunderstated shrieks\n(never heard of understated shrieks before?)\nfrom a mini-Moog (pre-sum ably). George Duke's \"ring-modulated\" and echo plex ed electric piano\" comes\nfloating down from nowhere and soon disappears without you not-icing, then Sal Marques\nreturns on trumpet and\ntakes up most of the\nrest of the track sounding like a saxophone,\nconversing occasionally with Zappa and\nDuke, and backed up\nby clanking drumming\nfrom Aynsley Dunbar\nuntil the original theme\nreturns, only now in a different time signature\nso that it isn't immediately recognisable.\nThe track suggested to\nme a bow in the direction of Miles Davies.\nThe two short tracks\nwhich open side two,\n\"Your Mouth\" and \"It\nmight Just Be A OneShot Deal\" are only as\nZappa-satire whose butt\nis unknown. \" Deal\" is\nnotable for a verse\nsung with a Scottish\naccent (now who the\nhell is that directed\nat?) and a rather nice\npedal steel solo from\nSneaky Pete Kleinow.\n\" Waka/ Jaw aka\" has\na far more conventional\n\"big-band sound\" to it\nthan \" Big Swifty\". The\nhorn sound is much\nfuller with Marques\nbeing joined by three\nsax players. I imagined\nthis on \" Syd Lawrence\nplays the best of Glenn\nMiller's Greatest Hits\"\nuntil the characteristic\nwa kwak guitar cuts in.\nTowards the end of his\n\" solo\" Zappa abandons\nhis pedal and plays\nsome of the straightest\n\"aural wallpaper\" you\ncan imagine. Then\nthere's an eight-armed\ndrum solo from Dunbar\nbefore the whole ensemble returns and\nfades away leaving (I hope) all you Zappa\nfreaks everywhere optimistic about the new\ndirection the maestro\nhas decided to take. If\n\"Chunga's Revenge\"\nwas the last of his records which you bought\nmake this the next.\nBut what happened to\nSuzy Creemcheese,\nFrank?\nNo, Bob Dylan is not appearing in the theatre in London at the moment.\nHe's just here to balance up the page.\nIt is May; but as this review is not due to appear until October, I will\nhave to indulge in some hasty prophesy. By my estimation these following\nShows (that I have seen for FELIX over the past year) will still be running:\n\"Company\" (Her\nMajesty's) is the best\nMusical running in\nLondon. New York,\nMarriage and Society\nare given a pretty thorough roughing-up in\nthis production, and\nSondheim's lyrics are,\nsimply, superb. I enjoyed \"Canterbury Tales\"\n(Phoenix) but mainly\nbecause of the imaginative sets (a weakness\nof mine) and the lustre-less \" Showboat\"( Adelphi) is strictly for\nthe nostalgic who want\nthe hero to get his Gal.\nFarces? A simple\nchoice of two for me.\n\" How the Other Half\nLoves\" (Lyric) just\nholds pride of place\nTHEATRE\nof\nto\nfrom \" Move over Mrs.\nMarkham\" (Vaudeville)\nbut only because of a cleverer ince pti ve idea,\nand both are very\nfunny. Actually, to my\nmind, \"The Mousetrap\" (Ambassador's) is best treated as a pur\nely amusing piece\nwriting, as it is not suf\nfic i ent ly well-clued\nbe a genuine who-dunn it. Apart from these, I have reason to recommend \"The Philanthropist\" (Mayfair), (rave\nreviews all round);\n\"Journey'sEnd\", if\nhas transferred from\nthe Mermaid (it has \u2014\nto the Cambridge \u2014\nEd.) and \" Sleuth\"( St.\nMartin's) which de-it\nserves to run twice as\nlong as \"The Mousetrap\" (work that out!)\nBut the best shall\nwait until last . . .\nand the two plays that\nI recommend above all\nare \" Gods pelI\"( Wyndham's) in which\nthe Gospels are given\nan energetic, beautifully un-Blasphemous\n(I believe) re-working;\nand \"Jumpers\" (in\nrep at the Old Vic) in\nwhich Tom Stoppard\nhas created an endlessly amusing play,\nwhich curls and twists\nupon itself to obscure\ninitially, and reveal ul-tim at ely, a core of\ngreat significance. But\nthe greatest of these is\n\"Godspell'.\nTHE REVIEWS PAGE\nThis year's FELIX review page will continue to feature Records, Theatre, Films and Rock Concerts. In addition it is planned to include reviews of Paperback books (see below), Classical Records, Concerts, TV and Radio. To do this, we need\nreviewers for most of these. If you would like to review for\nFELIX, please contact us \u2014 see advertisement on page 5.\n\"About Sex\" by Claire Rayner (Fontana)\nPerhaps it would be a little cruel to say that sex by Claire lacked any real\nbite or definition purely because it was written by a woman: however, all\nthe way through the book, Claire Rayner tended to shy away from the real\ncontroversies in 20th century sex.\nThe most annoying\nexample of this is the\nparagraph ' Illegal\nPractices\", where she\nsays \" As anal intercourse is illegal, even\nbetween husband and\nwife in privacy, it is\nnot possible here to\nmake any comments\nabout the desirability\nor otherwise of the\npractice\". Ends.\nI found the section\non abortions slightly\nbiased against them \u2014\nmainly because some\nof the more modern\ntechniques in abortions which have considerably improved\nand quickened abortions were not cov-ered.\nHowever, compared\nto a large number of\nsex encyclopaedias\navailable, \"About Sex\" definitely falls on the\nliberal side. But it certainly wasn't \"Out-spoken . . . a remarkable new guide\" as is\nproclaimed by the\nPAPERBACKS\n\"News of the World\" review of the original\nhardback edition printed on the cover.\n\"A Dictionary of\nDrugs\" by Richard\nFisher and George\nChristie (Paladin)\nA dictionary of\ndrugs is definitely no\nmore than it claims to\nbe, nothing more than\na dictionary \u2014 try and\nread this and all you\nwill get is tangled up\nin chemical equations\nand medical jargon. In\nmy brief look through\nthis book I was impressed by the unbiased and accurate\n(so far as I could tell)\nreporting of the fifty-six different drugs list-ed. In the Introduction\nthe authors are quick\nto point out that they\nare dealing with \"drugs\" \u2014- \"not nar-co tics, drugs in general \u2014 therapeutically\nuseful chemicals, for\nthe treatment of dis-ease\".\nThis doesn't mean\nthat they have avoided\ncovering important\ncontroversial social\ndrugs such as cannabis or Lysergic acid\ndiethylamide.\nEach drug is covered in its own individual section. The\ndrug, its effects and\nits uses are explained\nin a simple easily understood manner while\nthe chemistry and physiology are a little\nmore difficult to ex-plain.\nIf you want to know\nwhat the physician is\npouring or pumping into your body then this\nis the book to have\nstacked behind your\npills and hypodermics.\n\n"
