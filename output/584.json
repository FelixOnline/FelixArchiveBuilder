The path\nis not at right angles to the river, and the land\nin the acute angle between the two has been\nWeather spoon's allotment for as long as\nanyone can remember.\nOn the allotment there is an old pig-sty (a mathematical 'point' pig-sty, with position, but\nno size or shape) and Weatherspoon is toying\nwith the idea of getting some fences together,\nand building a pig-pen to keep a pig in.\nNow, the pig must be able to get to his sty.\nAnd he must be able to get to the river, so that\nhe will have a ready supply of fresh drinking\nwater. And it would be convenient for\nWeatherspoon if he could get to the pen from\nthe path without crossing the rest of his\nallotment; in other words, the pen must extend\nup to the path.\nBut fences are expensive, and Weatherspoon wants to keep the total cost of the pen\nas low as -possible, so can you help him by\ntelling him how to find the positions for the\nfences which will enable him to use the\nshortest possible length of fencing.\nNow before you start muttering things like\n\"non-linear trigonometry\" and reaching for\ntextbooks on the calculus of variations, I should warn you that while this is the kind of\npuzzle which will take several hours if you go\nabout it the wrong way, the right approach will\ngive you the answer in about fifteen seconds.\nHave fun!\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office.

    "content": "Letters\nto the\nEditor\nDear Sir\nOn Tuesday lunchtime, like\nmany others, I went along lo the\nGreat Hall. Most of the audience\nlistened to Mrs Shirley Williams.\nBut not lor me the polities behind\nBritain's newest party. No,I enjoyed the erratic clatter of a camera shutter. It didn't really\nruin a line talk. I should have\nbrought along my camera then\npeople would watch me instead\nol the speaker. I could forget all\nmanners and even dazzle the\naudie nee as I photographed Mrs Williams from behind. But I didn't because it would have\ndenied the pleasure of the dick\nthat did.\n1 'ours\nHS Rollcv\nMe chEng1 Dear Ed\nDuring my semi ene bri a ted wanderings between the ale houses of South Kensington a disturbing economic fact has\nfiltered through to my addled\nbrain. It has come to my at tent in that between8:00 and9:30 pm. for seven days a week,\nthe Norfolk Hotel, situated conveniently close to the Institute\nFranca is. is selling Fullers Pride.\nSam Smiths and Ruddles County\nfor fifty pence a pint. The first\ntwo of these beverages are also\navailable in Stan's Bar for fifty-seven pence a pint.\nAt first my suspicious mind\nwondered if the patrons of Stan's were being ripped off. but alter\nfurther mental exercise I realised\nthat, with Rae Snee looking alter\nour interests, this could not be so.\nAt last week's UG MI asked Rae\nto explain this disturbing discrepancy and she said that it was\ncaused by \"College inefficiency\".\nHow, I wonder, should the residents of Southside react to\nthis \"inefficient y\".' Personally. I have taken to boycotting Stan's between the hours of 8:00 to\n, 9:30pm. However, if my absence\nI has been noted It has probably\nbeen blamed on Geoffrey Howe's budget or our imminent bowel\ndisrupting examinations.\nA recent Con Soe poll has\nshown that Rae Slice s popularity\nis not particularly high. Rar could rectify this situation by\nensuring that cheap ale is\navailable lorou r pie exam depression and post-exam piss-ups.\n(Hirers lor nou\nNick Cox\nChe mEng1 Dear Sir\nRecently a little publicised meeting of the IC Students' Residence Committee resolved\n\" that in allocating women's places between the various Halls\nand Houses, a percentage of between 25% and 30% should be\naimed al in each of the mixed\nresidences\" (Item 7.1. minutes of\nthe Students Residence Commit tee, 4 March1981). The \"details\nof how the places should be\ndistributed\" were left for future\nconsideration by a sub-committee\nconstituted from the members of\nthe S RC. This sub-committee\nmet. and concluded its deliberations over the Easter vacation,\nwithout informing or seeking the\nopinions of non-members with a proper interest in the changes\nproposed, and before the minutes\nof March4 S RC Meeting were\npublished. It was decided lo\nincrease the number of mixed\nmale and le male Halls to six (to\ninclude Weeks and Tizard. as\nwell as Beit, Selkirk. Linstead\nand Falmouth).\nIt is my opinion that the initial, innocent sounding, proposal accepted by S RC. in\nfact concealed a significant and\nalarming shift of policy. Il has.\nuntil now. been the ease thai\nprimarily three Halls( Be il. Selkirk and Falmouth) have been\ndesignated as mixed, and have\nhad roughly equal proportions of\nmen and women. Linstead Hall\nhas recently become partly mixed. It seems that now we are\nto share the women in residence\n(the total number of whom will\nbe k epi roughly constant), rather\nlike chocolates, amongst the majority of IC Halls.\nUndoubtedly the practice of\nmixing men and women in residence is one thai improves the\nquality of life in Halls, and would\nbe endorsed equally by both men\nand women. This improvement\ncan. however, only be realised if\nboth men and women exist\ntogether in a balanced society. 1\n1\nseems then unlikely that the\npreviously all male residences\nwill derive significant benefits by\nintroducing a handful of women.\nIl is one of the less appealing\naspects of life al IC thai women\nare in a minority. There is a continual awareness amongst\nwomen of their minority status; a feeling reinforced by the behaviour and opinions of their\nmale colleagues. The only pans\nol College society where women\nhave been integrated into normal\nbalanced societies are Selkirk,\nBeil and Falmouth. The S RC has\nordered the destruction of societies\nand is demanding the restoration of\nthe general imbalance. The consequences of these actions will\nbenefit no one; they will succeed\nonly in exacerbating the already\ndifficult position of women al\nIC.\nIn my opinion, thai of the Beit\nHall Students' Residence Committee, and a substantial number\nol both men and women students,\nserious errors have been made by\nthe S RC both in the nature of\nthe changes made, and in the\nmanner in which they have been\nbrought about.\nWe would all dowell to\nremember that the issues involved\nare primarily social, not political\nor arithmetical. The social group\nmost significantly affected by\nthese changes will be women,\nand therefore the planning ol\nsuch changes should carefully\nconsider the opinions of women\nthe msl eves. The S RC lias patently\nfailed to seek the opinion ol\nwomen students (or of anyone\nelse).\nI hope that this letter will\ninitiate serious consideration of\nthe issues raised by all students,\nand especially women students,\nand will result in j mh li c discussion\nol questions which relate lo us all.\n.

    "content": "IC GAMES 1981\nThe College athletics championships took place at Motspur Park, the\nLondon University sports ground, which is presently in its jubilee year.\nThe Games were held on a sunny day early this term and the competitors enjoyed the company of STOIC and some students from\nCharing Cross Hospital.\nEach event was hotly contested.

Crowe at the other end\nwas looking mean and nasty \u2014 mind you, he always looks like that.\nCrowe took two early wickets, one a simple chance to Everett a catch to\nClark. Martin Ellacott was given a bowl and looked much more like his\nold self bowling long hops and full tosses down the leg side.\nFortunately Silva was more accurate and with the help of appalling\numpiring from Salter he picked up an early wicket. Slator also bowled\nwith amazing accuracy and he took a wicket when Everett moved\nsharply behind the wicket to stump the Churchill Captain. Lunch was\ntaken with Imperial appearing to have Churchill on the rack.\nImmediately after lunch Slator bowled a loose ball down the leg side, the batsman connected with a good sweep and Kennedy at short leg,\nconfused by the FA Cup Final, decided to stop the ball with his head.\nNot only was this an expensive drop but also Kennedy had to leave the\nfield and retire to the nearest hospital for a precautionary X ray. The\nbatsmen now took control and it was not until Crowe returned to collect\nthree more wickets and jug-buying figures of 5-37 that IC were back in\nthe game. One of these wickets was a simple catch to Slator who had\nmade a real mess of an earlier opportunity. Silva and Slator each took\none more wicket to reduce Churchill to 125 for 9. However their hard-hitting No10 and dogged No11 survived and added a further thirty\nruns. It could have been fewer if Morton had held a chance two inches\noff the ground diving six feet to his right (Wonder who is writing this\narticle - Ed.). He didn't and Churchill declared at 155 for 9.\nThe IC innings got off to a disastrous start with Simpkin missing a full\ntoss and White being run out by Clark. Clark made amends by\nscoring 63 not out. However, most of his early shots seemed to be\nattempts at giving catching practice to the Churchill fielders. They\nobviously need more practice as they dropped them all. Morton was\nbeginning to look dangerous but sacrificed his wicket in the race\nagainst the clock for the runs. After Everett, Slator and Crowe had\ncaused the scorer (Mrs Ellacott) little bother, Silva and Clark were\ninstructed to play for the draw. They took this instruction very seriously\nand refused to look for any runs. Rumours that the refusal to run was\ndue to the large bulk of Silva remain unconfirmed. IC finished on 114\nfor 9.\nA good night was had by all in the bar. After a drawn game of cricket\nthe honour was settled on a boat race where we stuffed them. We also\ndrank them out of bitter and wrecked the opposition with a rather silly\ngame.\nTEAM: Everett, White, Simpkin, Clark, Morton, Slator, Crowe,\nEllacott, Thompson, Kennedy.\nRock Minton\nr Laboratory\nTechnicians\nCore and PVT Analysis\nAberdeen\nRedwood-Corex, a joint venture comprising Corex\nLaboratories \u2014 a subsidiary of the NCB's Scientific\nServices \u2014 and Moore, Barret & Redwood \u2014\nBritain's leading independent petroleum technology\ncompany \u2014 provide integrated core and PVT\nservices to oil exploration and production companies.\nBased on rapid success, the company is expanding\nits operation with new facilities and requires\nadditional analysts for its Laboratories in Aberdeen.\nThere are a number of vacancies covered with\nconventional, special core and PVT analysis at all\nlevels.\nIdeally, candidates should have an H NC and\ndegrees in geology, physics or chemistry, coupled\nwith relevant experience in one of the areas\nmentioned.\nThere are a limited number of openings for trainees\nand where appropriate training will be given at the\npartners laboratories prior to relocation in Aberdeen.\nSalaries are competitive and offered together with a relocation package where appropriate, and career\nprospects in this exciting young company are\nconsidered outstanding.\nPlease reply in enough detail to make an\napplication form unnecessary at this stage, to:\nREDWOOD1^ Redwood-Corex Ltd.,\nRosscliffe Road,\nEllesmere Port,\nCheshire.\nRedwood Corex\nx \u2014'<>^\u2014' Keawood u or ex MEND A BIKE\nNew and\nUsed Cycles\nFully\nGuaranteed\nSAME DAY REPAIR SERVICE\nNew bikes from \u00a365 including VAT.\nUp to 10% discount on presentation of this ad.\nPARK WALK GARAGE,15 PARK WALK,S.

    "content": "Reviews\nFilms\nDeathwatch\nCert AA. Starring Romy Schneider,\nHarvey Keitel. Directed by Bertrand\nTavernier. Opened yesterday at the Paris\nPullman.\nDeathwatch is an English language French/German made film set in Scotland in\nthe near future.\nHowever, advancements in the field of\nmedicine have been startling. Virtually all\nknown diseases have been eradicated such\nthat death only occurs by violence or old age.\nViolence is familiar to everyone, especially\nafter \"The War\" and is hardly worth reporting\nthese days. Old folks are whisked off to the\nHome when they no longer respond to vi ril it iy pills and are given drugs to reduce their\nawareness of the concept of death. The drugs\noften lead to premature senility but this is\nthought preferable to acknowledgement of\ntheir impending demise by the doctors who\nalways know best.\nThe absence of death from society has bred\na morbidly curious television audience. N TV are quick to boost their ratings with Deathwatch\u2014a programme which shows what\nit is like to die \"in the old way\".\nTechnology has made gigantic leaps in\ntelevision, too. The film opens with Roddy\n(Harvey Keitel), an N TV producer, undergoing\nthe final tests on the latest experimental mini ture camera that has just been implanted\nin his head. Everything he sees will now be\nrecorded on videotape in the studio. Technology fails miserably for the sake of the\nplot, however, when he is told that the camera\nwill blow its circuits if exposed to darkness for\nmore than a couple of minutes. He is advised\nto carry a torch at all times and given\nun sleeping pills for nigh time! Roddy thinks it's just great, a new toy to end all toys!\nThe main theme of the film is invasion of\nprivacy. Roddy doesn't immediately think in\nterms of his own lack of privacy and is\ndelighted when told of his latest assignment\u2014a scoop for N TV \u2014 a woman who has just been\ntold by her doctor that she will soon die of a rare disease that has escaped modern surgery\nand pills.\nVincent Ferrimen (portrayed excellently by\nHarry Dean Stanton) is the sick N TV director\nwho gives the viewers what they want. He\ndispatches Roddy on the trail of the dying\nKatherine Mortonhoe (Romy Schneider).\nThe plot thickens under the splendid direction of Bertrand Tavernier.\nDeathwatch is in the same league as Stalker\n(reviewed last term), relying on development\nof human emotions against a science fiction\nbackground and is not heavily into special\neffects like most SF films. Futuristic social\ncomments abound; some are very amusing\nsuch as the scene where Roddy is shopping in\nthe supermarket against a soundtrack of a deep feminine voice urging people not to\nshoplift as they would feel bad about it later.\n\" Your sub-lim s are running slow,\" he tells the\ncash desk girl. \" Damn,\" she sighs, \"they're\nalways doing that!\"\nAt first, I found it difficult to believe in the\nsociety which found the invasion of one's privacy perfectly acceptable if it \"benefitted\"\nthe majority of the public. I would expect such a society to be further in the future than\ndepicted here. On reflection though, looking at\nthe ever growing number of people who can\nlegally invade your privacy, and the recent\nPrince Charles/Lady Di phone-tapping, I think\nsuch a society could well be formed long\nbefore all disease could be eradicated from the\nworld and cameras implanted in heads (which\nas a scientist, I accepted more readily). To\ntake the Prince Charles example, I would\nestimate most of the people who were\noutraged would still read the transcripts if they\nwere placed in easy reach. Prince Charles was\nright not to maintain the Palace's usual\n\"dignified silence\" over such a matter, for that\nwould have advanced us further towards\nDeathwatch.\nDeathwatch is a very important film,\ncombining piercing social comment with very\nmoving drama\u2014go and see it NOW! Steve Marshall\nPS: The book will be available in the IC\nBookshop soon.\nRoddy and Katherine walking in the Scottish moors\nTheatre\nThe Seagull\nTO CELEBRATE THEIR 25th Anniversary the\nRoyal Court have, with help from Thomas\nKilroy, transplanted Chekhov lock, stock and\nbarrel to Ireland. There will, of course, be the\nusual collection of diehards who bele ive that\nyou shouldn't muck around with the classics,\nbut I'm sure Chekhov himself would have\nloved it. What Kilroy is trying to do is draw\nparallels between the two locations, Russia\nand Ireland in the 1880s,ab stent ee landlords,\ndemise of rich estates. The adaptation is\nskillful and complete. That well-known writer\nTrigorian has become Mr Astor and all other\nnames and references carefully \"celtic a ted\". The cast is very strong, headed by Anna\nMassey, a real Chekhov expert, with a memorable performance in BBC's Cherry\nOrchard to her name. The play runs until l June 8 and student standby is \u00a31.\nPerhaps somewhat heavy for revision time is\nMan and Superman at the National. Running\nfor over four hours with three intervals it is an\nepic. It is also the best play in London. If you\nthought Daniel Massey was good in Miller's Crucible on BBC over Easter, he positively\nglows in this production. The play can easily be\ndivided into two parts: the efforts of Ann\n(Penelope Wilth) to capture the wild spirit of\nher joint guardian John Tanner( Daniel Massey) which is stylish comedy; and the 'Don\nJuan in Hell' act which gives the play its punch.\nDuring this hour-long scene which consists of\na dialogue between Don Juan (Daniel Massey,\nagain) and Lucifer, the relative merits of\nHeaven and Hell are discussed. This fills out\nthe conflict of ideas hinted at in the main body\nof the play. If you are not totally befuddled by\nthe sheer mass of steely dialogue then beneath\nit all you will find Shaw's message. He is\nconvinced that women are merely trying to\ndistract men from improving themselves and\nsociety. Shaw himself never consummated his\nmarriage and generally lived a meager lifestyle\nas if trying to lead by example.\nAlso at the National is Pinter's Caretaker.\nThis play has a special significance for me in\nthat it made my hometown Sidcup famous. It\nbecame syn on amo us with lower-middle class\nsuburbia and as long as this play is performed,\nwill probably remain so. However, this\nproduction has a West Indian cast. Are they\ntrying to transplant Sidcup into Brixton?\nA word too (or perhaps two minutes silence)\nfor two plays you won't be able to see. The\nNational Youth Theatre will no longer be doing\nGotcha and Killing Time at the Shaw Theatre\nand the Old Vic Company is no longer residing\nin \"Balcanville\".\nBoth these companies have died due to cuts\nin their Arts Council grant. It is a reflection on\nGovernments' fickleness towards the arts in as\nmuch as the very year that the Barbican Arts\nCentre is due to open, with a reproduction of\nthe Globe Theatre for the RSC' s use, these\ntwo worthy companies are having to be\ndisbanded.\nOf the two, the National Youth Theatre is\npossibly the most important to lose. It\nspecialised on bringing theatre to young\npeople, at low prices and with plays relevant to\nthem. This was probably best summed up by\ntheir last production. This Barry Keefe's double bill showed the problems of dead-end\nkids drifting into petty theft and shows the\npotential social damage which is caused by\nwidespread youth unemployment. The company may well survive by going back to\nits roots in the pub circuit, but is important\nPage 6 FELIX, May 15, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "The Swinnerton-Dyer Report\n....ICU's Response\nTHE S WINNER TON DYER REPORT on the future of the non-medical Colleges in London University is considering the\nresponses to its initial findings. The final report, due in July, is\nlikely to have as much impact as did the Flowers Report on the\nreorganisation of medical teaching in the University.\nThe full text of IC Union's reply is given in Council papers\nand can be seen in the Union Office; the main points are\noutlined here.\nUnderlying the comments and\nproposals of the paper is the\na eee pta nee ol the seriousness ol\nthe problems lacing the University and ol any major changes in\nits organisation which are found\nnecessary.\nWhile not welcoming any particular solution, several options are proposed and discussed within the constraints ol\nbasic priorities.\nThe overriding requirement is\nthe need to maintain academic\nstandards, across the University\nand within individual Colleges.\nThus when assessing where cuts\nare to be made, Pro Ies s or Swinnerton-Dyer and his Committee are urged to bear in mind\nthe maxim \"quality not quan-t it y\". The IC Union paper places the\nhighest priorities on vocation ally orientated subjects, particularly\nindustrial courses, and specialist\nschools. Unique institutions such\nas SO AS, S SEES, and Birkbeck\nare emphasised and their status\ndefended, while highlighting the\nneed to maintain a balance throughout the University.\nTo achieve major savings, IC\nUnion accepts that the closure\nand sale of buildings may be\nrequired, but stresses that such\ndrastic action must not strike at\nthe heart of the University. Indeed the conclusion states that\n\"it is better to amputate a part\nrather than risk the health ol the\nwhole body.\"\nBefore any such irreversible\nsteps are taken, urgent steps\nare should be taken to lind im mediate financial savings. Each\nschool must examine procedures,\nimprove efficiency and eliminate\nwaste. Suggestions include de central ising the functions ol\nSenate House to the larger colleges. Thus registration, entrance requirements and examinations would be administered locally; while the University assumes the role of a central,\nco-ordinating body.\nThe IC Union response includes\nstrong criticism of several points\nin the initial Report. SwinnertonDyer predicts a drop in income of\nup to 20% over ten years. Most of\nthis is directly due to withholding\nof the \" subsidy\" for overseas\nstudents and the consequent fall\nin their numbers. ICL ni on maintain that the lull effect of\nthis policy will be felt after only\ntwo more years, showing the\nimmediacy of the problems facing the University.\nThe predicted reduction in\nhome student numbers due to\nfalling birthrates is also doubted.\nIndeed applications to University\nmay even increase, \u2022 with the\nencouragements lor women, working class and mature students\nto continue further education.\nWhen necessary stall reductions should be made by natural\nwastage and early retirement.\nWhere redundancies have to be\nmade, IC Union proposes that\nthese are compulsory: voluntary\nredundancy will only bring the\nloss of the best academic stall.\nGovernment money has already\nbeen made available to ease such\nchanges, but IC Union urges a thorough examination of the\nstatus ol academic stall.\nOl course, the position ol\nstudent unions and student facilities is highlighted. The University of London Union, in\nparticular, is vigorously defended:\nperhaps this only serves to\nemphasise its vulnerability in the\nsituation.\nIn conclusion, the IC Ln ion response expresses the belief that\nthe Government has miscalculated the effects of its financial\npolicies, and vainly hopes for a reprieve. It is difficult to envisage\nProfessorS winner to nD ver pleading such a ease. Whatever\nconclusions are published in July,\nthey are bound to meet a hostile\nreaction from some direction; the\nSwinnerton-Dyer Committee has\nan unenviable task.\n3Fs Annual Dinner\nwill be on Monday, May 18 in\n'The Ark' just off High St.\nKensington.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nBig day for jolly Jack Tar\nLAST WEDNESDAY EVENING about 140 local residents and\n200 students and staff turned out to IC's public relations\nexercise 'Meet Imperial College 81'.\nInteresting displays had been set up in the J CR, and the Sherfield\nBuilding was specially spruced up for the occasion. Later on, guests\nwere treated to wine and snacks, including sausage rolls which did not\nseem popular, although Mr Mooney assured FELIX that these were\nthe same as those served in the refectories.\nOne of the more prominent visitors was Mr Mark Carlisle, a Cabinet\nMinister. He was shown around the exhibits by the Rector, Lord Flowers, and he spent some time at the ICU stand talking to Ruth Hildebrand. Mr Carlisle later made a sizable donation to Rag funds of\n\u00a3\\A5(\u00a3l ol which he borrowed). Later Mr John Passmore, ICU President explained the situation on overseas students lees to MrCarlisle, who is Secretary of State for Education.\nMost visitors at Meet IC seemed to have enjoyed it, although\nattendance was not as high as had been expected.\nCaptain Lindley, Domestic Secretary, who was the chief organiser of\n'Meet IC took time on Wednesday afternoon to talk to FELIX about\nhis hopes and aspirations for 'Meet IC FELIX: How many people are coming lo 'Meet IC\"?\nCaptain Lindley: It's very difficult to give you an exact answer; we\nknow that as of now we are expecting a total of about 500. but you see\nthe difficulty is when you start out, as we did in 1979, you have to try\nand find out as best you can the numbers of invitations you have to\nsend out to get anybody to reply at all, and from previous experience\nhere we were ol the opinion that it would take about two and a hall to\nthree invitations to get one acceptance. So we've sent out a lot of\ninvitations and we've had a lot of answers, but not nearly as many as\nperhaps you would like in terms ol proportions. It's interesting because\nthis time we've got almost the reverse of what we had last time. We ended up with rather more refusals than acceptances. This time we've\ngot a much higher proportion of acceptances. Given the decent\nweather and we've had a lot of invitations to which no one has replied,\nI 've consistently said that we'll have somewhere between 500 and 700\nin total.\nFELIX: So you would be disappointed if there weren't more than 500?\nCaptain Lindley: II we got about 500 to 600. that's what we're\naiming at.\nYo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!\nOne of the amusing things about 'Meet IC is the lengths that college\nwent to in 1979 to obtain large numbers of drawing pins. However,\nCaptain Lindley did not think this was tunny.\nFELIX: In 1979, I believe, a drawing pin sub-committee was set up lo gel\nlarge numbers of drawing pins of the same colour. Has anything humorous like\nthat happened this year?\nCaptain Lindley: No, let me correct you. There was no drawing pin\nsub-committee. It was merely decided as part of the business of one\ncommittee meeting when we covered the nature ol the type \u2014 how big,\nhow many and what colour, and it was said, 'Right. Drawing pins all\none colour.' I'm sorry, there was nothing humorous about it.\nFELIX: Is it live that tonight you, or your staff, will stand and count the\nnumber of people at 'Meet IC'?\nCaptain Lindley: Oh, I see. We're going to get back to that, are we?\nIn fact, of course we shall try, we shan't count them as heads going by.\nYes we've got to try to get a record. People will be there to receive\nvisitors and give them programmes, and part of the job will be to keep\na check on numbers.\nThis last question referred to a remark made by Captain Lindley in\nthe Autumn term. Throughout this session, doubts have been expressed about the\nnecessity of Meet IC and Captain Lindley's organisational ability.\nAnyone actually al Meet IC would have no doubt about either \"I these.\nCollege had no doubts about this event's benefits: they had sent out\nabout 1300 plus invitations to people and spent about ^2000 plus an incalculable amount in administrative costs. Captain Lindley refutes\nany allegations about his ability.\nFELIX: It was said at ICI' Council on Monday that you are only given the\norganisation of 'Meet IC' to stop you meddling in other things. Hoiv do you take\nthat?\nCaptain Lindley: If you want me to give you an answer in straight\nplain English...What utter rubbish. Never heard of it. If there was a grain of truth in it you could ask the Rector. Lets talk sense. The\nHouse Committee before 1979 discussed in detail the idea of a kind of\nget-together which would allow us to bring in local residents with the\nobjective of furthering our relationships with them. We tried it out in\n1979 as a pilot scheme, it was considered to be highly sucessful . and il\nthe number of letters and comments made are any gauge at all. So the\nCommittee decided they would like to have the same thing at a suitable interval, two years. I had no part to play in thai at all.\nShiver me timbers, me Hearties!\nA notable absentee from the evening was Mr Nick Morton, ICU President elect. He was invited but returned his invitation complaining about the expense. Many students acted as demonstrators\nat the exhibits and about I went y had been invited as guests. Twelve\nstudents acted as guides, and they wore white sweatshirts with 'Meet\nImperial College '81' printed in green. Four secretaries from Sherfield\nacted as rec option is ts and these were the people who had been\ndelegated to \"stand and count ' em\" by Captain Lindley. These\nsecretaries wore green skirts which they made themselves alter Captain\nLindley had given them material, cotton, zips and a pattern.\nIt was a little disappointing that alter so much time had been on it.\n'Meet IC was seen by so lew outsiders (137 \u2014 we counted 'em). Others\nsuggested that the displays might have been left up for students to see\nthe next day so that they too could get some idea ol what the College is\ndoing. The general opinion of those FELIX talked to was (hat tin\nevent was not well attended, and it was hard to say il the expense was\njustified as the returns are not tangible. Although some people\nexpected (or hoped for) a Hop beforehand, they were proved wrong.\nNo decisions have yet been taken about a possible 'Meet IC' in 1983.\nIt's periscopes up and torpedoes out week\nin your fun, fun, fun, FELIX!!!!!!!!!!!!\nNo. 584 Friday, May 15,1981 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "Council Report\nICU Council had a turgid, poorly attended meeting last Monday\nnight. Matters discussed included female residents in Halls,\nand Overseas Students Committee finances.\nThe meeting spent hall an hour on the subject of reallocation of\nfemale places in' Hall. Mr Azhar Rizvi. Beit Sub-warden spoke to\nCouncil asking them to dissent from Student Resident Committee\ndecision. However, Mr John Passmore (who sits on S RC' with Mark Clegg and Pete Stevens from Council) proposed a motion to reaffirm\nthe S RC's decision and this was passed on a vote.\nThere was heated debate on the Overseas Students Committee\nfinances issues. At last Council Pravin Patel, OS C Chairman was asked\nto present a report on it. This was not available at Council, although\nMr Patel had handed one in last week. Mark Clegg proposed at motion\nol censure on Liz Lindsey. It transpired during speeches that there bad\nbeen a misunderstanding in the Union Office, the motion was\nwithdrawn and Liz Lindsey photocopied Mr Patcfs report. When Council saw the report, it was felt not acceptable. Mr Patel was then\ncensured by Council for the way OS C money had been spent.\nP WP are to look into the matter.\nAn attempt to change the estimates with regard to S CC subscriptions, namely that subscriptions should not be debited from\nclaims to College was unsuccessful. The meeting went into closed\nsession lo discuss the awarding of colours.\nAt the end of the meeting it was suggested that Capt Lindley was\nonly given the organisation of \" Meet IC\" to slop him meddling in\nanything else. This brought mild laughter from the Iwentv-two people\nstill left.\nDavy Repossessed\nat RCS AGM\nON TUESDAY the RCS AGM took place. Ten minutes into the\nmeeting about thirty Miners burst into the lecture theatre in\nan attempt to retrieve Davy, the\nMiners' mascot. Fire extinguish-ers, a pick handle and a smoke\nbomb were used in the attack.\nAfter being repelled the Miners\nlaid sei ge to the room.\nThe meeting then continued\nand the following people e lee led: Simon Moore, lint s Chairman; Fiona White I aw, Assistant Honorary Secretary; Fia nk ie Williams, Publicity Officer; Nick\nLast, And\\ N ced ham, Theta bearers. Some minor posts were\nalso filled. In addition to the\nawarding ol about fifty colours\n(social and athletic).\nTansy Hepton. Nick Morton, Steve Gunn, Paul Johnson, Steve\nTyson and Rich Archer( ex-officio) received the Union General Award which is awarded\nfor outstanding service to the\nUnion. Nick Watmough was rea warded the De rye k Bond Memorial Award for the year's most exceptional faux pas.\nAbout half way through the\nmeeting a large number ol\nGuildsmen arrived to aid the\nMiners. However. Dave Gayer felt the situation was potentially\nviolent and against the spirit of\nmascot ry, and so persuaded the\nGuildsmen to leave.\nTo avoid liut her confrontations it was decided to give back\nDavy for the sum of \u00a3200. The\nin e cling was closed with a Kangela by the new executive\nand their initiation then took\nplace in Beit Quad and al the\nRound Pond.\nLicence to breed\nmoney\nVIEWERS OF BBC Television's The Risk Business will have seen\nProfessor Brian Hartley, former\nhead of Biochemistry, being interviewed. The program ' A Licence to Breed Money' concerned the commercial is ation ol\ncertain biochemical processes\nand the professor described his\nassociation with one of the new\ncompanies in the field, based in\nGeneva, which has since made\nhim a \"paper millionaire\" along\nwith bis research in the \"bowels\nof Imperial College\", to quote\nJudith Hann, the program's narrator.\nIn what has become typical of\nBritish science programs,' A Licence to Breed Money' yet\nagain confirmed that British ideas hardly ever succeed in this\ncountry, but elsewhere. Il emphasised the point, by follow-inga discovery made by a leading Oxford research bio-chemist, which has ended up\nmainly in the bands of twenty\nAmerican companies alter tailing\nlo be protected by the NR DC. The pro lessor was at no loss,\nhowever, to stress that, had there\nbeen a British company in the\nfield, be would have been the first\nto join i be in. Ibe program did end on an\noptimistic note describing the\nformal ion of a Biilish company,\nwho are taking on .British talent\ninstead ol letting them go\noverseas.\nIC Rag Fete\nQueen's Lawn\nSaturday, May 16\n2:00-5:00pm Women in Hall\nA RECENT discussion by the\nStudents Residence Committee\nto reallocate the proportion of\nwomen in Halls of residence has\nprovoked criticism from Beil Hall\nresidents. The S RC decided that\nas from next year there would be\nwomen in Tizard and Weeks\nHalls. This week Mr Azhar Rizvi. Beit Sub warden, has\nwritten to FELIX and spoken at\nUnion Council on the subject,\nand four Beit residents attempted\nto make a verbal presentation to\nan S RC meeting on Wednesday\nafternoon. However, they were\nnot allowed in because it was a closed committee, but presented\na written statement. An edited\nversion is below:\n\" We accept that the overall\nproportion of women in residence\nshould rei lee l that of the College\nas a whole, but in the interests of\nthe women concerned, women's places should be concentrated in\na sufficiently small number ol\nHalls and Houses to ensure a reasonable proportion of women\nin each,\nII the policy proposed by the\nS RC were to be adopted, the\nadvantages of mixing any Hall would be diminished; a small\nminority of women would not be\nsufficient to contribute positively\nto the atmosphere of the Hall. In\naddition, women would suffer in\nHall under the same imbalance\nof the sexes as they do in Imperial\nCollege generally, something many potential women applicants might find unattractive.\nThere are surely ways of\nmixing presently single-sex Halls\nand Houses without disturbing\nthe balanced ratio that exists in\nsome Halls at present.\nWe are concerned thai the\ndecision to redistribute the\nnumber of women's places in\nHall and House was made by the\nS RC without consultation ol any\nwomen students, and il is in this\nlight that We ask you to reconsider\nyour decision\".\nII his s lal ri ue nl has been edited for\nIbr sake of space-Ed. I Guilds AGM\nGUILDS AGM was held last\nTuesday on the steps of the\nAlbert Memorial. Dave Gayer,\nRuth Hildebrand. Sara Mr Guinness and Andy Dixon received U GAs. Tit of the Year\nwas awarded to Ben Bourdillion\n( FELIX first with the news\nagain! Ben was branded \" Tw at of the Week\" way back in November).

ULU Elections\nLAST THURSDAY UL U General Union Council( the new\nsovereign body of the University\nStudents' Union, which replaces\nboth the old Students' Representative Council and the Joint Assembly of Councils) held its\nfirst AGM. Annual reports were\naccepted from: Anna Clarke, President; Bob McDonald, Vice President (Finance and Admin); Nick Weeks, VicePresident( Services); Jan Falkowski, Sports\nCouncil; Jim Bryce, Societies\nCouncil; and John Passmore,\nS RC. Copies of these reports, and the\n1981/2 estimates are available\nlor inspection in the IC Union Office.\nHustings then followed for the\nthree sabbatical posts for 1981/2.\nThe results were as follows: President, Martin Young( QM C);VP( Finance & Admin), Gillian\nMorgan( Bedford); VP( Ser-vices), Lesley Gillingham (Inst oi\nEd). There being no opponent,\nDavid Josse (Kings) was ratified\nas GU C Chairperson for 1981/2.\nfbe meeting then moved on to\ndiscussion ol motions.

    "content": "A Hitchhiker's Guide to Travel Insurance\nby Sue Telling of Student Services Horror stories of holidays ruined by inadequate\ntravel insurance, mainly arising from the cost\nof medical treatment, most notably in North\nAmerica, have alerted travellers to the fact that\ni the medical expenses section of a travel\ninsurance policy can be its most important\naspect.\nMany insurance companies have recently\nresponded by stepping up the medical expenses\nlimit without too great an increase in premiums.\nAnything less than \u00a310,000 cover in Europe and at\nleast double that amount in USA and Canada\nshould not be considered adequate.\nThe UK does have reciprocal health care\narrangements with other EEC countries and also\nwith Austria, Bulgaria, the Channel Islands,\nCzech os lava kia, the German Democratic Republic, Finland, Hungary, Isle of Man, Malta,\nNew Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal.\nRumania, Sweden, the USSR and Yugoslavia\nHowever, since the range of cover varies\nconsiderably with each country it is still advisable\nto retain medical insurance and possibly include\nextra cover where necessary. Also, students over\nnineteen years of age do not always qualify for the\nEEC schemes. Leaflet SA30, available from IC\nStudent Services and local offices of the DHSS\ntells you who is covered, which medical services\nare free in each EEC country, and how to apply\nfor them. It also outlines the seperate agreements\nbetween the UK and the other countries\nmentioned above. If you do qualify for free or\nreduced cost treatment in the EEC countries\n(Belgium, Denmark, Eire, France, the Federal\nRepublic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg\nand Netherlands) this will usually only be\nprovided on production of form El11, which can\nbe applied for by filling in the back of leaflet SA30.\nThose who have already become entangled in the\nmachinery of the DHS S will understand the\nnecessity to ask the social security office for this\nform at least a month before setting off.\nPolicies can be bought as a package or as a selective deal. The package policy is invariably\nthe cheaper alternative for a conventional trip.\nHowever, selective policies, which allow travellers\nto choose which risks they prefer to cover, can be\nuseful when certain clauses in a package deal are\nnot needed; as a topping up exercise when an\nexisting policy is insufficient; or to obtain\ninsurance for longer periods than under a package deal. Some standard or package travel\npolicies can be purchased in units and if the sums\ninsured for one unit are not sufficient you can\ndouble them by taking out an additional unit.\nPackage policy cover usually includes your\nluggage, cancellation, medical expenses, personal\naccident and personal liability. Some with an eye\non current trends in holiday hazards include cover\nfor delays caused by industrial action and hi-jacking. Features of package policies that need\nwatching, apart from the medical expenses limit,\nare the exclusion clauses and the permitted cover\nfor lost money. Volunteers in work camps, with\ninsurance arranged by the camp may be covered\nfor accident, disablement, loss of personal\nproperty, or sickness. Package insurance policies\nmay also contain an exclusion clause on medical\nexpenses for an accident or illness while engaging\nin manual labour.\nIf you are travelling as part of an organisation\nwith cover already arranged for participants do\nobtain precise information on what the policy\nincludes. The College worldwide insurance cover\nis a good example of the need to avoid\ncomplacency when someone else is handling your\naffairs. This insurance, for students engaged in\nuniversity or union organised sports and other\nactivites, still retains a ceiling of \u00a31,000 for medical\nexpenses incurred abroad. Along side this is the\nincredible anomaly of a \u00a350,000 medical limit for\nIC academic staff.\nEndsleigh (71 Old Brompton Rd, SW7, tele:\n589-0183) is the most well-known insurance\ncompany for students, but as far as travel\ninsurance is concerned it does not compare well\nwith schemes handled by travel agents and banks\nfor shorter periods up to three weeks. Endsleigh is\noften best for longer periods, but check out different policies since the premiums and the\nperiods they relate to vary considerably. One\npolicy may be best for a two week trip to Europe,\nwhile another may be more economical for six\nweeks in North America. We do have all the\nEndsleigh policies in this office for comparison\nand also details of the National Westminster\ninsurance services which can be arranged\nthrough Tom Cottrell at the campus branch.\nIf you do decide to go with Endsleigh, they are\nstill operating at last year's premium rates (and\nlast year's maximum cover) until 1981 proposal\nforms are printed, which could be any time now.\nAFTER THE EXAMS, when it's all over and you\nwant to relax and blow what's left of your grant,\nwhy not go on the Guilds trip to France. It will be\non Wednesday, June 24 and there are only fifty\ntickets at \u00a311 each. We'll leave Victoria at 8:00am and return there at 9:17pm having spent five and\na half hours in Boulogne. Full details and tickets\nare available from Ruth in the Guilds Office.\nCaving\n' \" DANGLING on a fragile rope, with only a helmet\nlight to guide him, a cave r descends into the dark\nof the earth. What will he find? Not, according to\nTony Waltham the \"nasty muddy hole\" of popular\nbelief, but a strange and challenging world of dry\ncaverns, narrow crawl ways, noisy underground\nrivers and crashing waterfalls, of peaceful\nchambers and sudden beauty; of total blackness\nand silence. A world where man is an intruder,\nand must crawl, climb, swim, dive and even travel\nby boat to make his way.\nTony Waltham explores this remarkable\nenvironment in all its aspects; the varied nature of\ncaves; the skills, difficulties and rewards of caving\nas exploration and as sport; how caves are\nformed; how they acquire their classic ornamentation with stalactites, stalagmites and\nother mineral formations and colours; the part\ncaves have played in man's development, from\ntheir use as simple prehistoric shelters to modern\nexploitation and research; the bizarre, specially\nadapted animal life of caves; and the spectacular\nextremes of famous caves around the world.\nTony Waltham is an experienced cave r and has\ntravelled most of the world in search of the new\nand interesting. In 1970 he led an expedition to\nexplore the caves of Nepal and Kashmir. He is\nalso a skilled photographer and has spent much\ntime perfecting the difficult techniques of\nunderground photography. He is a lecturer in\ngeology at Trent Polytechnic.\" \u2022\nThe introduction to the book Canes, written by\nTony Waltham, and is one of the finest books on\nthe sport for its excellence of photography. Tony\nWaltham was president of Imperial College\nCaving Club, since then his interest in caves has\ngrown enormously, with one of his most recent\ntravels being on the Mulu Expedition, in his own\nwords \"caving in some truly incredible caves\".\nOn Monday, May 18, Tony Waltham will be\ncoming to Imperial College to present a talk on\nhis part in that expedition, with a large selection\nof slides. The talk will be in Lecture Theatre 303 in\nthe Royal School of Mines at 7:30pm( admission\n30p), and if you have any interest at all in the\nfascinating world of caves, then it is a talk not to\nbe missed.\nWellsoc\nWELL SOC LIVES once more! The Herbert\nGeorge Wells Society of Imperial College was\nfounded in 1963 to investigate subjects on the\nborderline of science fiction and fact and to\npromote the appreciation of the works of HG Wells. The society evolved into the largest and\nmost active society in the whole of the University\nof London, and it shall be once again!\nWellsoc are in the process of inviting lecturers\nto the College to speak next year on any subjects\nthat might be of interest to students at IC.\nPrevious lectures have included hypnotism (with\ndemonstration!), the paranormal, gambling,\nhumour, special effects in the cinema, etc., etc.\nIf you fancy joining a society that is a little bit\noff-beat and fun or if you have any ideas about\nspeakers you would like to hear or even if you are\nonly vaguely interested get in touch with Tony\nRayham, Chem 1.\nDeath to all martians.\nPallab Ghosh\nChairman 1981/2\nSF Soc\nWELL, Flesh Gordon was a great success.

As a result, we will\nchance permitting, show Alien and 2001-A Space\nOdyssey next academic year (Alien free\nto members).We also have managed to purchase\na small planetoid with the proceeds. I have been\nasked to mention (against my better judgement) a Rag Fete stall. We will have a Rag Fete stall,\nwhere our secretary, will be on display. Anyone\nwho \u2014 My God!

Ever thought of giving blood?\nYou probably know about the National Blood\nTransfusion Service, but have you heard of the\nGLRBCBTS? This is a voluntary organisation\nwhich complements the NBTS by providing\nFRESH blood from donors at short notice, thereby\nsaving lives in emergencies. Sometimes up to 24\nhours notice can be given (eg for a scheduled\noperation) and the service tries to send donors to\ntheir nearest hospital.\nAn initial blood test (for which, transport will be\nlaid on) is all to get you started.\nTo enrol, or just for further details, contact\nRoger Serpell on int 3707.\nPage 8 FEUX, May 15, 1981\n\n"

In view of the wealth of\nideas and musicianship showed by these\nbands, it's a crying shame that they receive so\nlittle support from students in the College. The\nC ND Benefit was well attended, but the\naudience consisted almost entirely of C ND members from outside College. The Nothing\nPersonal gig attracted nothing like as large an\naudience. Considering the number of people\nwho moan about the lack of entertainment in\nCollege, it's annoying that so few of them take\nan interest when it's provided on their doorstep.\nAnyway, on to the bands. The Vegetables, a very competent R'N' B band, played a set\nwhich was unfortunately merely adequate.\nThat they can do much better was proven at\nthe C ND gig; clearly the band are very subject\nto atmosphere and audience response. They\nplay a selection of standards and originals with a lot of drive and enthusiasm, although they\nsuffer badly from the lack of a good front-line\nsoloist. They are a fun band to see, although\nnot really up to scratch last Friday.\nNothing Personal achieved a remarkably\ntight sound for a band doing its first gig. Their\nsongs, although incorporating technically\ndifficult aspects such as occasional strange\nsignatures, are always access able and easy to\nlisten to. The use of a violin in the frontline\nmakes a pleasant change, and it is nicely\nblended in with the rest of the band. I can't help thinking, though, that the band are taking\nit easy a lot of the time. Since they obviously\nhave a lot of talent, and a lot of potential,\nperhaps they should be attempting things a little more adventurous\nThe Phoenix\nON SALE NOW!!!!!\nAvailable From:\nFELIX Office\nICU Office\nIC Bookshop\nMost Libraries\nCND\nSINCE IT'S FORMATION last November ICC ND Group has achieved a wide base of\nsupport (over sixty on our mailing list) and has\nsuccessfully organised a number of diverse\nactivities. Speakers, in conjuction with the Staff\nEuropean Nuclear Disarmament Group, include\nDr Michael Pentz of the Open University,\nChristine King from National C ND, Joan Riddock\nand Dr Michael McCarthy. The banned BBC film The War Game was shown to three packed\nlecture theatres (an overwhelming response); five\nleaflets have been written on disarmament issues,\nof which two 'Civil Defence' and 'The Arms Race'\nhave been published and our books tall has been a regular feature at many events. Last week the\nC ND Benefit Carnival was attended by two or\nthree hundred and raised over \u00a3100. Thanks to all\nwho helped, especially Eric Jarvis and the bands\nand disco who gave their service for free. We\nhope to organise another one sometime.\nMembers of the Group have been active in\nSANA( Scientists Against Nuclear Arms), London Student C ND and at the Student C ND and Campaign Activists Conferences. The Group\nwas represented at the Easter march to NATO headquarters in Brussels (televised worldwide)\nand at many other C ND events.\nMuch is planned for next year and activities are\ncontinuing throughout the summer. Currently we\nare fighting a ban on marches (theoretically\nintended to restrict neo-fascist groups inciting\nracial hatred) and will be 'assembling' in Glasgow\nearly in June.

It is likely that this will not apply to\nany student who has registered with a NHS General Practitioner before October 1, 1981.\nIt is essential for any overseas student who is in\nthe country before the due date to register with a NHS doctor. This is done by simply filling in a form in the doctor's surgery, and making sure\nthat the doctor forwards the form to the local\nFamily Practitioners' Committee before October\n1.\nAny overseas students who have not registered\nwith a NHS doctor are advised to do so at once!\nA J Haines\nBookshop News\nNow is the time we have to order our stock for\nnext term.

But I also happen to think that\noccupation by an enemy power is also an evil\nthing. The C ND slogan \"better red than dead\" is\na piece of dialectic that hides the real choices that\nwe have concerning nuclear weapons. The slogan\nto begin with shows quite clearly that C ND thinks\nthat the threat to our security comes from Russia\nrather than from America. (I wonder what their\nattitude would be towards nuclear disarmament if\nAmerica was threatening to occupy us.)\nAnother aspect of world strategy not taken into\naccount by C ND is how Russia views its potential\nstrategic position in a future war. Russia effectively has the same problem, albeit on a larger scale, that Germany had up until 1945,\nnamely that in all probability Russia would have to\nfight any future war on two fronts, viz Europe and\nChina, with America supplying aid to both sides.\nNow the obvious solution to this problem is to\nattempt to remove one of these fronts with as\nlittle inconvenience to them as possible.\nThus we in Europe must be prepared to resist\nRussian aggression to the best of our ability. This\nis not a question of ideology\u2014Russia is not a socialist state in any sense that I would use the\nterm\u2014it is a question of sheer naked power. For\na totalitarian state to exist with the support of its\npopulation it must produce an external threat to\nits security in order to justify its repression at\nhome. This is why many of the poor Third World\ncountries fight pointless wars\u2014to maintain the\nexisting government in power.\nThe necessity for expansion and aggression is\ntherefore inherent in the Russian system. The\nonly thing that they understand is power. The\nonly way to prevent Russian advancement is to\npossess sufficient power to persuade them that\nsuch expansionist aims would only bring ruin\nupon their own country.\nThis is the kern al of the theory of deter rant. That by possessing the material strength and\npol t ical will to use that strength if necessary, we\npersuade the Russians that it would, from their\npoint of view be pointless to attack us. But if we\nhave neither the material strength or the political\nwill then Russian aggression is inevitable. C ND strikes at both of these aspects. By their very\nasking for unilateral disarmament they reduce our\npolitical will to di sua de the Russians, and at the\nsame time endeavour to abolish our material\nstrength to deter them. Let me make it quite clear\nthat I think that by attempting to do this C ND bring closer that event\u2014nuclear war\u2014which we\nall abhor. The Russians would not have any moral\nscruples about using nuclear weapons, especially\nif they knew that we had none with which to reply.\nFELIX, May 15, 1981 Page 7\n\n"
