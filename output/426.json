    "content": "IN US POSTGRADUATE CONFERENCE PG issues must not be ignored\nin national campaigns\nTHIS WAS the feeling of the NUS Postgraduates conference held at\nImperial College on the 2nd and 3rd of\nthis month. For far too long issues such\nas PG grants have been left to go by\ndefault once the Undergraduate grant\nlevel has been set. It will be particularly\nimportant this coming year as it is the\nyear of the DES' st rien niel review of\nfunding for education. The usual excuses\nof wanting to do something, but having\nto work on a strictly limited budget will not apply so strongly this year as the\nDES will have a chance to seek new funds and reconsider the allocations to\nvarious sectors of education.\nIn a time of heavy public spending\ncuts it was vital that PG s did not suffer\nbecause there is no voice in their defence.\nThe conference recognised that the\ncampaigning tactics employed for UG issues might not attract much support\namong PG s so the Postgraduate Advisory Group will consider ways of building\nan effective campaign, probably involving\nthe encouragement of PG s to write to their\nMPs and\" seeking representation for the\nAdvisory Group to such bodies as the\nDES and the Government.\nPGs and Trade Unions\nThe Conference opened with Sue\nSlipman ( NUS National Secretary, with\nresponsibility for PG s) in the chair and\nfar fewer PG s than expected. There were\nonly around thirty delegates representing\na still smaller number of colleges and\nUniversities. Initial discussions were\ncentred on the present state of affairs\nbetween PG s and the two trade unions\nwith an interest in PG s, that is, the\nAUT( Association of University Teachers\nand ASTM S( Association of Scientific\nTechnical and Managerial Staffs).\nThe recent decision of the AUT to\njoin the TUC may change their attitude\ntowards PG s. The usual suspicion of trade unions was present and many\npeople did not feel that there was anything to be gained from membership\nof either union. This will almost certainly\nbe true unless the AUT are prepared to\noffer a new deal to PG s in the foi m of a better class of membership and a reasonable level of representation for\nPG s both within and by the association. The majority of the conference was taken up by discussions of the report\non the future of PG education presented\nby the PG Group. The document was an\nattempt by the group to respond to the\nreports on Postgraduate Training/ Education which have been receiving a lot of attention over the past year. In\npreparing the report the Group found that\nmerely replying to the re com end at ions of\nthe other reports would lead to them\nadvocating the status quo. To overcome\nthis, they decided to start from scratch\nand lay down what they felt were the\nessence, requirements and constraints of\nall forms of Postgraduate education.\nCheap research labour\nThe discussion considered a great\nvariety of issues under the headings on the discussion paper and a great many\nuseful additions to the report were made\nfrom the floor. One area of particular\nconcern was the justification of research\nboth as something useful and necessary\nto society and the educational system,\nand as a more valuable and broader\neducation to the individuals concerned\nthan is often supposed. The need to\nprevent too much stress being put on the\nimmediate industrial usefulness and sale ability of the product of a PhD project were upheld by the students\npresent. Such stress can often causa e the educational aspects to be overlooked.\nThe CASE scheme of co-operative\nstudies with industries was c irt ici sed as being open to abuse and allowing\nsome students to be used, as cheap\nresearch labour for industry.\nFunding also came under the critical\neye of the conference and recommendations\nincluded the setting up of an arts\nresearch council similar to the Science\nResearch Council, to correct many of the\nanomalies produced by the present\nhaphazard systems of funding for\nresearch into arts subjects. Changes in\nthe present system of awards were also\ncalled for, both in the rigid three year\naward made at present irrespective of the\nduration of the course and in the relaxation of the first degree grade stipulations.\nOn the subject of supervision,\ndelegates felt that the system needed to\nbe investigated especially in that the\npresent single supervisor set-up can\ncause several problems. In the even of\nthe supervisor leaving or even dying\nduring the duration of a student's work\nmany problems and even long delays are\noften experienced. Also, in the event of\npersonality clashes between student and\nsupervisor or disagreement over the\ndirection of the research, the student\noften finds himself with no one else to\nturn to for help or advice. Students\nfrom polytechnics present, where it is common to have an academic and an\nindustrial supervisor, said that this\novercame many of the above problems. The\nidea of having more than one supervisor\nwas well received by the conference.\nThe report will now be redrafted by\nthe Advisory Group and should be ready\nfor circulation in the autumn.\nMore effort on PG affairs\nChairing the meeting on the second\nday was Steve Moon the NUS Executive\nOfficer who takes over from Ms Slipman\nthe responsibility for PG affairs. He\ndoes not have as a bat ical position but\nhopes he will be able to devote a lot\nof time and effort to PG s since his other responsibilities on the Executive\nare not too time consuming. He intends to\nstart by trying to get more money from\nNUS to support the PG Advisory Group\nin order that it can be more active and\nalso get more information back to PG groups and societies in colleges. He\nfeels sure that something can be done to\novercome the perennial problems of\norganising and communicating with PG s, but with only thirty at the conference, it\nis not a very inspiring start.\nRICK PARKER External Eclairs:\nthe end of an era\nTHE END of session is with\nus once more; Union Officers\nare crashing about our ears,\ncut down in their primes (which\nprimes \u2014 Ed), and I am putting\npen to paper.

    "content": "* !M1L\nObituary:\nRON KILL WITH THE sudden death\nearlier this month of Ron\nKill, Imperial College and\nImperial College Union have\nlost a very dear friend. At the\ntime of his death Ron was a final year postgraduate student\nin the Department of\nChemistry, and the SubWarden of Tizard Hall.\nOn coming to College in\n1970, Ron became heavily\ninvolved in the Association FootballClub and despite\nliving at his home in Enfield he played regularly for both\nthe first and second teams.\nHe maintained his interest in\nthe Club throughout his time\nat College although the\ncommitments he was to take\non in later years was to put\nan end to his playing career.\nRCS Rag\nRon was pleased to\naccept a place in Ti zard Hall for his final year as\nan undergraduate, and he\nlived there for the rest of\nhis life. Now that he was a full-time member of College rather than a commuter he\nlooked around for things to\nfill his spare time. He was\nelected as Secretary to the\nHall Committee and very\nmuch enjoyed the social life that w. as built around the\nhall. Having been elected\nas Chemistry third year\nSocial Representative Ron became involved in RCS Union and was immediately\nmade Secretaty of the Carnival Committee. He spent many\nhappy hours working for RCS Rag, organising collections, stunts, and building Rag\nfloats.\nThe job of Secretary to\na Committee is often used as\na testing ground, and this\nwas so with Ron. His previous experience on the\nCarnival Committee made him\na strong candidate for the\nVice P residence of RCS Union. He was elected to\nthat post in the summer of\n1973. Immediately after his\nelection he took part in the\nGreat Tartan Race in which\nteams raced a barrel from\nEdinburgh to London and\ntried to raise as much money\nfor charity as they could\nen route. RCS came a creditable third. His year as\nVicePresident was a very\nsuccessful one although it\nwas marred by arguments\nwithin the Executive. At the end of the 1973-74\nAcademic year Ron was\nelected Deputy President\nof IC Union and was appointed Sub-Warden of\nTi zard Hall. It is in respect\nof these two positions that\nmost people outside his department will remember\nhim. During his year as\nDeputy President Ron managed to put the Union\nback onto a planned cycle of re decoration and refurnish-ing. He also played a very\nfull and very weal part on the\nExecutive of the Union and\ndespite the friction it\nsometimes caused he was\nvery outspoken. I know that\nhe will be remembered as a 'Ron Kill will be remembered as a fine\nadministrator and one of the best Deputy\nPresidents by all those in the Union Office'\nfine administrator and one\nof the best Deputy Presidents by all those in the Union\nOffice. Ron very much\nenjoyed his time as SubWarden of Ti zard Hall. He\nbelieved that the Hall should\nalways be run by the students,\nand that he was there both\nto encourage them to more\nactivity, and also to restrain\nthem when he felt they\nwere getting out of hand.\nUnder his guidance and\nwith the help of many\nenthusiastic students the\nHall seems to have had two\nsuccessful years.\nIt was ty pic d of his\nsensible character that Ron should choose to spend his final PhD year out of\n\" public life\" working hard\nat his thesis. This was\nalmost completed when he\ndied. He had a very bright\nfuture in Chemistry and had\nreceived job offers from\nCambridge University and\nSouthampton University.\nGreat Loss I am sure that many people\nin the College will have\nfond memories of Ron and\nwould like to join me in\nsending condolences to his family, and to Ruth, his\nfiancee, who he should have\nmarried at the end of this\nweekend. We have all suffered a very sad loss. PETER R TEAGUE President\nImperial College Union\nDespite the fact that I am\nworking my'fingers to the bone\nthroughout the day in Harrods\n(known to some as Boots\nProvincial) thi-s long awaited\nPG issue has finally hit the\npress. Many did not think that\nthey would live to see it -that may be true of the Union\nHandbook, but it certainly isn't where FELIX is concerned. So,\ndismissing the sc ep tics with\nno more ado, I shall proceed to\nthe content of my last (honest)\nEditorial.\nThe Summer Accommodation\nCentre scheme is running into\na few sticky patches this year.\nI hear that there have been one\nor two words exchanged on the\nsubject of left-over meal tickets;\nsurely the question is not\nwhether students should be able\nto use them or not, but why\nthere are so many left over at\na\". On good authority we hear\nthe quality of the food is this\nyear better than ever before, so\nit can't be that they don't like\nwhat they are being served\nwith..\nIt is of some interest to me\nthat UCC A, the University\nCentral Council on Admissions,\nhave introduced a two pound\nfee (to cover admin.) to become\neffective 77 for entrance 78.\nOne wonders whether this will\ndeter any prospective students\nfrom continuing into further\neducation; probably not, but it\ncertainly appears to make a mockery of the concept of free\neducation. A lot of people have\nvoiced criticisms against the\nnotion of payment for the\nservice offered by UCC A, but\nfew have expressed the same\nconcern over, or even mentioned,\nthe practices of the Northern\nUniversities J MB, who for some\nyears now have been charging\nan 'administrative fee' for\nperforming a similar operation\namongst its five university\nmembers .\nI was, like many, bewildered\nand shocked to learn of the\nuntimely and tragic death of\nRon Kill earlier this month. In\nthe last four years Ron played\nan extremely active part in\nUnion and Hall life, enjoying\nhis student days to the full. It\nis a shame that there are not\nmore like him at IC, for it would\nbe a better place to five and\nstudy. I'm sure that I speak for\nall the staff of FELIX and\nstudents in expressing my\ndeepest condolences to Ron's fiancee and family.\nIn closing, if you would like\nanother PG issue of FELIX, all contributions will be accept-ed. Thanks for this issue are\ndue to Duncan, Gill, Ian and\nClive.\nUCCA FEE\nAPPROVED\nTHE Universities Central\nCouncil on Admission s(UCC A) has decided to\nintroduce an 'applicants fee'\nto all prospective students\nwho use the UCC A scheme.\nThe fee will be introduced\nnext autumn (1977) for students\nentering university in 1978\nEach student will be required\nto enclose a \u00a32 cheque or\npostal order with his or her\napplication.\nThe decision to levy the\nfee came as a result of a ballot, organised by UCC A. Each educational organisation\nusing UCC A was asked to\nindicate its view on the\nproposed fee. The voting was:\nFor the fee 55, Against 39,\nAbstentions 2, Replies not\nreceived in time 4. Imperial\nCollege Board of studies had\nearlier decided to abstain in\nthe voting.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nTHE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THESE A( Certificate\nx) Stars: Sarah Miles, Kris Kristofferson, Jonathan Kahn, Earl Rhodes\n105 mins. Opens shortly at the\nCarlton, Hay market.\nThis film, in the opinion of both\nFelix staff who went to see it, has far\nmure potential than both the marketers\nand Screen International are willing to\ngive it. The posters make it out to be\nno less 'action packed' than 'Sex the\nScandinavian Way', whilst the blurt\nput out in the critical reviews reckons\nthat it rates 9.5 foi gore.\nDespite the rather macabre plot the\nfilm is neither gory nor does it descend\nto the level of aB rate sex movie. In\nfact it has an enthralling and captivating\na story as 'One Flew Over The plot\nhan q sar nun rl th pad nlp scent problems\nbetween Jonathan (Jonathan Kahn) and\nIns widowed mother y Sai an Mnesj. The\nlatter falls in love, and decides to marry,\nthe second lieutenant of the Boston\nBelle, a tramp steamer that arrives at\ntheir picturesque Devon harbour.\nMeanwhile Jonathan has discovered a peephole from his bedroom to his mother's. It is through this peephole that we see the carnal side of the love affair develop.\nThe factor, though, that sets this\nfilm apart from the rest is the secret\nsociety to which Jonathan belongs. The leader of the pack, to coin a well worn,\nbut in this case quite befitting, expression\nis simply called' The Chief( Earl\nRhodes). He is a child beyond his years, aware of the contradictions of\nadult society upon which he casts his own contemptuous interpretation.\nThe rest of the cabal view him in\nawe, ruthlessly kept in line by the\nChief. He scorns their teenage infatuation\nwith soft-porn magazines, focusing\ninstead on the 'pure and perfect order\nof life' and how it has been defiled by\nadults. Morality, he maintains, is an\ninvention of adults.\nHe encourages his crew to 'dismantle\nthe rules', resist adult tyranny and seek\n'the inner being' in all things. To\ndemonstrate this last point, the cigar-smoking chief, whose father is a doctor,\nat one point dissects a cat in front of\nthem.\nTo our relief the dissection is not\nshown in graphic detail, the scene\nremaining tasteful and artistic throughout.\nWhen Jonathan's mother falls for the\nhandsome, nig ged, quiet-spoken Jim Cameron (Kris Kristofferson), he\n(Jonathan) at first hero worships him. Then, as the jibes of the Chief become\nmore frequent, as do the visits by the\nsailor, his opinions are turned against\nJim, who has upset the perfect order...\nThe punishment meet ed out for this,\nand other crimes, is the same as that\nfor Cedric, the Chief's cat: d ii section after being drugged.\nWhilst the film is horrific by implication,\nall scenes have been carefully and\nthoughtfully constructed, and no-one\nshould leave the cinema feeling queasy \u2014\nan d if it wasn't for the 10 minutes or so of 'stuff through the peephole' it is doubtful whether it would carry an X label.\nThe film is engaging from the start\nand well worth seeing; director Lewis John Carlino has handled the story well, retaining much sensitivity and plausibility.\nParticularly credit worthy is his direction\nof the teenage actors Jonathan Kahn and\nEarl Rhodes. Kris Kristofferson also produces his best performance to date.\nDuncan Suss Clive Dewey\nMilligan's Midsummer\nMadness\nSPIKE MILLIGAN famous goon,\nhumour is t and cult hero; slightly less\nfamous as trumpet player and defeat er of\nthe Third Reich; virtually unknown as\nflower arranger and insect taxidermist \u2014\nis back in town. His( initially) shon run\nof late shows at the Mermaid has now been\nextended to July 31st. As we entered the theatre a distant\nvoice over the PA said \" Can we start,\nnow\", and lit the blue touch paper to an hour of hilarity and music. All the old goon lines were there:-\"\n'\"ello, 'ello, 'ello. What's going' on 'ere\nthen?\" \"It's a show, officer, hut I can't get it started.\" Spike makes noises of\nengine (trying to start but failing\nmiserably) \"Do you 'ave a licence for\nthis show?\" Spike produces licence and\nshows it to himself. \"But that's a dog\nlicence. \" \"Woof!\"\nThe music which was delightfully\nwoven in amongst this madness was excellent, and included several of\nSpike's more off-beat renditions, such\nas 'The flight of the bumble-bee while\ncleaning one's teeth\", and accompanying\nthe piano by playing the classified adds,\nfrom the Evening Standard. The whole\nshow had that thoroughly ad-lib bed look;\nthe audience themselves provided\nfrequent distractions, as their comings\nand goings were highlighted by Mr\nMilligan' s torch and suitable comments.\nFrequent attacks on the 'Frustration\nDummy' (a very battered taylor's dummy\nwhich they 'knocked the shit out of if the\nshow wasn't going too well) and a song\non the theme 'Only a nose' during which\nSpike changed to steadily larger and\nmore red icu lou s theatrical noses, added\ngeneral state of insanity.\nOne thing which became apparent was the master's inability to relax in the\nshadows during the musical interludes;\neven with the sport on the singer and\ndarkness on the rest of the stage. Milligan dominated the scene. His frequent inter-up t ions during the songs had not only the\naudience, but also the singers, falling\nabout.\nOne joke, which particularly sticks in the mind, concerns an Irish surgeon\nwho performed the first successful haemorrhoids transplant.\nSpike's musical friends fitted the\nmood of the show, and their apparently\nsincere and uncontrollable laughter,\ndespite having gone through the show\nmany times, added to the impression that\nSpike had never bothered to read or even\nwrite, the script.\nOne left the theatre feeling happier,\nand madder, and more able to face the\ncrazy world outside and still come up\nlaughing.\nVoulez-vous\npromenade\navec moi ?\nWHAT COULD be more pleasant than\nsitting at home, on a warm summer's day, listening to your favourite music?\nHow about standing in the Albert Hall,\non a warm summer's day, listening to your\nfavourite music? As I am sure noone at\nIC can have failed to notice, 'The Proms'\nare with us again, and the many friendly\n(if eccentric) disciples of Henry Wood.\nThe first night (Friday 16th July)\nlit the stage for what promises to be\nan excellent season; Beethoven's \"Missa Solemnis\", and Kempe was to\nhave conducted, but his untimely and\nunfortunate demise brought back Colin Davis to the Proms Scene. A minute's silence was observed in memory and\nrespect of Kempe at the beginning of\nthe concert. Mr Davis' s interpretation of\nthe mass was characteristically exuberant;\nand in parts, the military pomp of the\nbrass section afforded clear contrast to\nthe angelic themes of the 'world to come'.\nThe quartet added variety and spice\nwith its free-flowing and uninhibited\nstyle (in contrast to that of the Missa\nSolemnis) The group was lead by\nUrsula Koszut; Anna Reynolds; John\nShirley\u2014Quirk and Anthony Rolfe\nJohnsonma.de up the foursome.\nAt the end of this short, exciting\nconcert, the promenaders were riding\nhigh on a wave of enthusiasm which will, hopefully, carry through to the end of\nthe season. As always, variety is foremost,\nand whatever your musical taste, there\nwill be some (at least) of your favourites,\nplus a chance to hear many less played\nand new pieces. There is a night of just\nBenjamin Britten's music, and fans of\nBrackner are given a rare treat later in\nthe season.\n\"The Proms are close and cheap;\neveryone should take advantage of\nthese two points; and of the chance to\nlisten to some great music. Forthcoming\nconcerts of particular interest and merit\ninclude Verdi's\" Falstaff\", Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\", and a particular\nfavourite of mine, Tchaikovsky's6 th Symphony, \"The Pathetique\".\nIn short, with the possible exception\nof some Gary Glitter fans, there is\nsomething for everyone at this year's Promenade Concerts; do try to go.\nRICK PARKER "

    "content": "4 FELIX\nTheatre Tom Stevenson takes a critical look at three\nplays on in the London areas.\nTake your choice - you can't lose\nTHE TEMPERATURE of the Lyttelton\nTheatre is maintained at a cool 20 C, as though to raise it by so much as one\ntenth of a degree might cause the\ndelicate production to wilt. The play in\nquestion is Noel Coward's Blithe\nSpirit in a new production by the National\nTheatre, thirty five years after its first\nLondon performance.\nNoel Coward; there's a name to\nconjure with, for Sir Noel was a man of\nextraordinary theatrical versatility. As a playwright his Hay Fever, Private\nLives and Blithe Spirit are still widely\nperformed; as a composer his songs,\nLondon Pride, Some Day I 'll Find You,\nMad Dogs and Englishmen have become\npart of the English heritage; as an actor,\nwho can forget his appearance in that\nmemorable film The Italian Job? And\n;yet, 1 suppose, you either hate or adore\nhis work, which is undeniably a predilection of the middle classes. To make a comedy from a plot in which the ghost of a man's first wife\nsucceeds in killing his second requires\na great deal of talent. The Lyttelton\nAudience laps it all up with bursts of\nspontaneous applause at appropriate\npoints throughout the action. Perhaps\nmany of them saw the play's first run\nduring the war in which, for a time, the\nauthor played the lead. Even so this is a production which deliciously evokes\nan age when there was no news on the\nfront page of The Times, when one\ndressed for dinner and when there were\ndomestic staff that were so difficult to\nhandle.\nMaria Aitken plays Elvira, the first\nwife, in a kind of glow which brilliantly\nsucceeds in reminding us that she is invisible to all save Charles and that\nhe is the only one who can hear her.\nOnce we have worked through a ridiculous\nseries of misunderstandings in which\nRuth, the second wife, naturally takes\ngrave offence at Charles' acid reaction\nto Elvira' s presence, there is a glorious\nmoment when Elvira reveals herself to\nRuth by carrying a vase of flowers\nacross the room, and only just avoids\nthrowing the water into her successor's face.\nThe play's most clearly drawn character\nis Madame Arc at i, the medium who\narrives for dinner on her bicycle and\napologise s for her lateness \"1 had a premonition of a puncture so I went back\nfor my pump\". But it turns out that she\ndidn't have a puncture. Maybe time\ngilds the memory, but Margaret Rutherford's performance in the film, with Rex Harrison, seems a difficult standard set\nfor the part, which Elizabeth Spriggs\ndoesn't quite reach. Eileen Diss' sumptuous set completes a magnificent\nproduction.\nIf Blithe Spirit evokes a past age of\nluxury then Weapons of Happiness brings\nus up to date with a veng ance. Howard\nBrenton's play is the first new work to\nbe commissioned by the National\nTheatre in the Lyttelton. Brenton is a member of a new stream of British playwrights committed to writing plays which\nreflect real if e as it is lived by the vast\nmajority of people.\nSo, in Weapon's of Happiness we have\na group of young people who occupy their\nworkplace, a run down potato crisp\nfactory. Also working in the factory is Josef Frank, a victim of the Czech treason trials of the early fifties, who\nhas escaped and come to England full\nof anguished memories of his life in\nthe East, which we see in a series of\nflash-backs \u2014 walking the streets of\nMoscow and meeting Stalin, on a trade\ndelegation, being instructed in the\n\" right\" answers for his Prague show-trial.\nWhilst the young and particularly inept\noccupiers carry on their little revolution,\nFrank stands by, full of experience and\nyet unable to help them, so strong is his obsession with the past.\nFrank Finlay shuffles about the vast\nstage as the Czech, Frank, clad for the\nmost part, in an enormous overcoat, as\nthough to protect him from the bitter\nwind that still blows from the East. Julie Covington plays Janice, the\nnascent Marxist, trying to put the ill formed ideas into practice and leading\nan unlikely group of British Youth\ncontaining a nose-picking deaf-mute, a violent illiterate and a Dylan-freak.\nThe bare stage is occasionally filled\nwith Hayden Griffin's magnificent\nsets, ranging from the London Planeteriiim\ncomplete with heavenly images (and a smooth talking announcer) to a dock side with twinkling lights in the back-ground.\nOne must assume that it is to celebrate\nthe recent bicentenary of the American\nDeclaration of Independence that the\nRoyal Shakespeare Company have chosen\nto resurrect Shaw's The Devil's Disciple\nat the Aldwych. However, having said\nthat, and many thanks to the programme\nnotes for having pointed this out, the\nplay is one of Shaw's Three Plays for\nPuritans ( the others are Caesar and\nCleopatra and Captain Brasshound's Conversion). It is the story of a man so\noppressed by his mother's obsessive Puritanism that he rebels and sets\nhimself up as a friend to the devil, though only so far as to respect the\nobject of his mother's hate. What he\nactually becomes is a highly moral\nup-standing citizen prepared to die for\nany man in town. It is a splendid play\nand receives magnificent treatment in\nthis production.\nTom Conti, as the disciple, leads a strong cast. His evident joie de viv re in\nthe face of his miserable mother, severely\nplayed by Patience Collier, livens up an\notherwise mournful gathering for the\nreading of his father's will. John Wood,\nveteran of Tom Stoppard's Travesties, in\nwhich he played the lead both as an\nold and a young man, switching with\nremarkable rapidity between them, sticks\nto General Burgoyne, the English\nCommander-in-Chief, known to his\nsubordinates as Gentlemanly Johnny;\nfrom his first appearance, when he lays\nhimself down on the courtroom table to\ncatch up on his sleep, we know every\ngram of comedy is going to be extracted\nfrom the part; and it is too.\nThe audience, packed with Americans,\nparticularly enjoyed the scathing\nreferences to English colonialism - what\nexcuse can we have for a production of\n\" The Apple Cart\", in which the American\nAmbassador in London requests re-admission into the British Empire?\nTHOMAS STEVENSON\nNational Student\nFestival\nDrama\nAt the Roundhouse Downstairs 27 July to 7 August:\nGas; Coup D'Et at; England;\nOctober 30th1975; Galatea;\nand The Key.

FREE' Tummy trouble at SAC?\nTHE SUMMER Accommodation\nCentre has got off to a good\nstart this year with only two\nminor disputes between the\nstudent staff and the College rippling the surface of the\nhotel scheme.\nUnder the watchful eye of\nMrs Audrey Pod haj sky, the\nBookings Manageress, and\nCapt Lindley, the Domestic\nSecretary, SAC has undergone\na major overhaul and is now\nbeing run on new lines in\norder to make the scheme\nfinancially watertight. Nothing\nwrong with that since the\nprofits from the letting s go\ntowards sub sidi sing students'\nterm-time hall rents, but the\ncharging of \u00a31 to visitors for\na Mooney breakfast has\nraised an eyebrow or three.\nHowever, it was the\nextent of the SAC overhaul\nwhich led to a certain amount\nof confusion. In previous\nyears, the wage advertised\n(Photo: Nigel Greatorex)\nSouthside cleared\nA MOTOR driving one of the\nlifts in Southside developed a fault on Thursday 15 July leading to the whole building\nbeing evacuated and three\nfire engines arriving to deal\nwith the trouble.\nThe fault in the motor caused a strong smell of burning\nrubber to pervade certain\nsections of Falmouth and\nTi zard Halls. The fire alarms\nsoon went off at 11.35 am and the message buzzed through the\nhalls, from landing to landing\nand staircase to staircase by\nthe cleaners who were working\nat the time j it was not a practice drill. Ten minutes later the\nbuilding was cleared and three\nfire engines arrived on the\nnorth side of Princes Gardens\nonly to be re-directed to the\nsouth side where they drew up\nfive minutes later. By now the\ncrowd which had gathered\noutside Southside were getting\nanxious.\nThe cause of the fire was soon discovered at the bottom\nof one of the lift shafts and\nmaintenance engineers were\ncalled in to deal with the\nproblem. By12.05 pm the\ncommotion was over and the\nHall inmates were able to\nre-enter the building.\nwas always the \" take home\" wage for the student staff.\nThis year, however many\nwere shocked on the first\npay-day to discover that this\nwas not going to be the case:\nthe wage advertised was \u00a315.84 and 91p was going to\nbe docked from that as an\ninsurance contribution. The take-home wage was therefore\ngoing to be \u00a314.93 which is\n7pless than last year! After\nquick consultations, the\nCollege agreed that the take-home wage for the cleaners'\nwould be \u00a316.01 and the clerks' wages would be increased\nproportionately.\nThe next source of worry\nfor the student cleaners was that question of unused meal-tickets which visitors had\npaid for but sometimes did not\nwish to use. These have\noccasionally been left as tips\nfor the cleaners and in the\npast, under the direction of\nthe scheme manager ess, cleaners were allowed to use\nthe tickets themselves. This practice has now been stopped.\nWhen a complaint was made\nabout this previously accepted\nincentive being eliminated,\nCapt Lindley insisted that\neach and every cleaner had\nbeen told before starting work\nfor SAC that no such tickets\ncould be used by students\nunder any circumstances.\nSeveral of the cleaners however\nare equally insist ant that they\nhad been told no such thing.\n.Despite the fact that the\nnumber of meal-tickets which\ncould be used by cleaners\nwould represent a drop in the\nfinancial ocean, Capt Lindley could not be .persuaded to\nchange his mind.\nClearly then, the new\npolicy for the running of SAC did not filter through completely\nto all the student staff.\nConfusion in\ncommunication\nunderstandable\nthere are new\nthe chain of\nis surely\nhowever when\npeople in new\nNUS quit\nLlandudno\nNUS will not be going back to\nLlandudno for its conference\nin December, it was announced\nearlier this month. The decision, it is stressed, is not a sign of dissatisfaction with Llandudno as a venue, or\nwith the services offered by\nthe council staff. In fact, the\nfacilities in the pier-head\npavilion are being re-organised,\nmaking it unsuitable for the\nnext two conferences. Both NUS conferences, December\n76 and Easter 77, will be held\nin Blackpool. Since then, however, the\nLlandudno council have\nrefused an application by CHE, the Campaign for Homosexual\nEquality, to held a conference\nthere. TheN US executive has expressed concern over this\ndecision, and have asked\nthem to consider.\njobs running what the College wants to be regarded as a new\nscheme.\nRON KILL, Subwarden of\nTizard Hall and last year's IC Union Deputy President\nwas found dead in his flat on\nMonday 28th June. At a subsequent inquest at Westminster\nCoroner's Court a verdict of\n'Accidental Death' was\nrecorded.\nObituary; see page 6\n\n"

    "content": "Coffee and World\ndevelopment\nAN OXFORD cooperative called\nUhuru has started to market a high grade instant coffee\nfrom East Africa as part of a drive to expose the social conditions in which many of the\ngoods we buy are produced.\nTrace your next cup of\ntea back to Sri Lanka and\nyou will find chronic malnutrition in the families\nwhich picked it for you.\nTrace your coffee back to\nBrazil and you will see the\nfruits of vicious exploitation\nof the poor. Your oranges may\nlead you to South Africa, your\ngrapes to the misery of the\nmigrant workers in southern\nCalifornia. The list goes on \u2014\nwhat Uhuru describe as \" a basket-full or rotten shopping\". Uhuru's coffee leads back\nto Tanzania, one of the few\ncountries in the world attacking\npoverty by making the poor\nRolling\non the\nRiver\nTHERE IS nothing - absolutely\nnothing - half so much worth\ndoing as simply messing about\nin boats, as Toad always\nsaid. So, take 100 IC\nPostgraduates, a suitable\ncraft, some booze, some food,\nsome good music and a moonlit stretch of the Thames\nand, if arranged in the right\norder you should finish up\nwith something really worth\ndoing.\nOn Thursday the 8th of\nJuly I found myself standing\non Tower Pier with all the\nabove ing redi ants. Well the\nmusic was a little late arriving,\nbut then the RCS J4 is not\nnoted for breaking world\nland speed records, and neither\nis Dave Dodge (Oh no? - Ed)\nThe boat drew away from the\npier just after 7 pm and PG G Riverboat Party was afloat.\nAll was quiet for the first\nfew seconds as we slipped\noff down the Thames in the\ngeneral direction of the sea and then some fool discovered\nthat the bar was open. An orderly queue fon ned and\nseveral participants were\ntrampled under foot. The main\nproblem was that the bar was\nbasically1 a water-tight\ncompartment (what-a tight\ncompartment), which rapidly\nfilled up with the people-with-continued on p.7 more powerful, rather than\nwaiting for benefits to\ntrickle down as the rich get\nricher. Unfortunately they\nst t ll need foreign exchange\nfor essential imports, and\nselling coffee is one way of\ngetting it. That will not be\neasy, for gluts of coffee have\nbeen common on the world\nmarket, and concerned people\nare worried about the use of\nland for cash-crops rather\nthan for food for local consumption. Such problems\nor decisions on development\nstrategies are never simple,\nand Uhuru are careful to\nmaintain that \" Our aim is neither primarily to sell good\ntasting coffee, nor to increase\ncoffee drinking or the coffee\ntrade. We are aiming to raise questions in people's minds\nabout just one of the things\nwe eat or drink every day.\" Hence the name \" Campaign Coffee\". It costs66 p for a4 oz packet, which is more\nexpensive than the big names\nbut the people who produce it\ndon't starve. And it does\ntaste good.\nPackets can be ordered\nfrom John Shade, Room 45,\nBe it Hall. Drop me a note, or\ncome round and try some if\nyou can catch me in. JOHN SHADE PG Problems\nDURING the time a research\nor MSc student is at IC it is a fair bet that he or she will not be short of worries of one\nkind or another. Furthermore\nthe difficulties of living in\nLondon on an inadequate\nincome combined with the\nambi qui ties of much PG activity tend to cause these\nproblems to interact.\nOccasionally aPG feels\nin need of College based advice but does not wish to\napproach either course co-or d in at or/ supervisor or Nightliie\nStudent Welfare. The head\nof your department/section\nmaybe an accessible and\nsympathetic guru. However, an\nalternative source of wisdom\non difficulties with major or\nminor \" college\" aspects of\nlife is to be found in most\ndepartments.\nAt least two College committees have recommended\nthat each department should\narrange that a member of\nstaff be available for consultation by PG s. Most departments\nhave accepted the value of\nthe \" safety net\" and have\nbeen able to appoint a suitable person. Since they\nhave not all publicised this,\na list of the staff involved is given below (ST indicates\nthat the person is the depart-ment's Senor Tutor).\nDepartmental PG Tutors/Advisors\nAero\nBiochem\nBotany\nChem Eng Chem\nCiv Eng\nCC DE lec Eng Geology\nHist of Sci & Tech Ind Soc\nMan Sci Maths\nMech Eng Met\nMining\nPhysics Zoo\nMR BRADSHAW DR DICKERS ON DR ALVIN( ST)\nDR MICHEL SDR B ATKINSON( ST)\nHead of Section/ Dept PROF GOLD SACK( ST)\nHead of Section\nDR AUDLEY CHARLES DR MB HALL MR P COM BEY MR KING DR Bershire (ST)\nDR CULVER( ST)\nDR WEST (ST)\nMR HOWARD PROF COLES Head of Dept. Also from Oct'76 each student will have an\nad vi sorts) in addition to a supervisor.\nRICHARD UPTON No! No! Don't read this-you're\nmuch too apathetic!\nI WAS about to write an\narticle about apathy amongst\npostgraduates when someone\npointed out to me that the IC\nCricket Team is composed\nalmost entirely of PG' s. Then\nit occurred to me that really, it\nis very difficult to define the\nstate of apathy in the Union. My original article was\ngoing to be a damning indictment\nof the 1400 - odd PG' s who\ndid not appear at the ICP G Group Annual General Meeting\nlast month. But was their non-appearance really a statement\nof contentment with their lot\nat IC? Maybe they feel that\nthey don't need the Union to\npress, on their behalf, for\nmore common rooms or higher\ndemonstrating rates. One thing\nI am sure of is that we do not\nneed the ICP GG to deal with\nsupervisor - student problems;\nthese are highly personal\nrelationships, and any attempt\nby the Union to legislate or\nset standards would be wrong.\nSo who are these apathetic\nPG' s? Not those who join in\nand utilise the various sports\nfacilities offered by the Union. Not all those overseas students\nwho take part in events\norganised by their national\nsocieties. Not those who\nwrite for FELIX or Phoenix\nor appear on STOIC or are\nheard on IC Radio. Not those\nwho belong to other Union\nclub societies. For the clubs and societies are the roots of\nthe Union. Many more students\ntake part in those activities than\nattend Union meetings or stand\nfor election to the multitude of\ncommittees which run the Union. The real apathetic are the\npeople who won't read this\narticle, those who take no\ninterest in the Union, except\n(perhaps) for the occasional meal or drink. But they are\njust as much members as\nthose of us who take an\nactive part in Union affairs.\nPerhaps they think that the\nUnion is an undergraduate-orientated body (it is, of\ncourse, but then whose fault\nis that?) and that the childish pranks of the UG' s do not\ncreate the right atmosphere\nfor those already armed with\na BSc or whatever. I must\nconfess that I sometimes\nswear never to darken the\nUnion building's doors again,\nwhen the entrance hall bears\nthe evidence of a particularly\nheavy night's drinking,- albeit\non the part of a very small\nminor ti y of members.\nSo, is there a solution to\nthis \" wave of apathy\"? Or\nshould we be content to allow\nstudents to lead their own\nlives and not coerce them into\nactivity in a body in which they\nappear to have no interest?\nTOM STEVENSON "

IC fielded two teams - the\nfirst in the Ladies Plate,a competition for college crews,\nand the second in the Thames\nCup, an open event.\nBoth crews were found accommodation at Henley in the days\nleading up to the Re gaU a, and\nthis enabled us to train on the\ncourse. On the first day, both\ncrews won comfortably, beating\nLincoln College, Oxford, and. Townmead RC respectively. The\nl st VIII again showed their class against Queen's College,( C) taking a lenght's lead in less than a minute and rowing home\nwell in front. This win put them\nthrough to the third day and into\nthe quarter finals .where they\nwere narrowly beaten by Queens'\nBelfast. The 2nd VIII were not so lucky with their draw on Friday,\nbeing matched against the eventual winners of the Thames\nCup, Harvard University .How-ever, fast conditions and a good fight back resulted in the\nfastest ever time over the course\nby an Imperial crew - 6m.44s. On Sunday, IC's super-oarsmen Andy Bayles and\n'Basher' Burch (rowing for\nThames Tradesmen RC) won\ntwo of the most prestigious\nevents of the Regatta - the\nGrand Challenge Cup (for VIII's) and the Prince Phillip Cup( for\ncox ed fours).\nSTOP PRESS: First eight\nstroke, Paul Langguth, won a gold medal in the National\nChampionships al Nottingham.\nRowing in a cox ed pair with a Leander Club oarsman he finished two lengths clear of the\nrest of the field; the time was\njust two seconds outside that\nof the cox less pair winners.\nI St. VIII\nM Johnson(bow), I Hyslop.\nS Worley, J Fitzgerald, J Skrypniuk, J Blaind, N Gillett,\nP Langguth(stroke), J Kirkpatrick(cox).\n2nd.

Unfortunately, the Imperial\nCollege attempt on the National\ntitle seemed fraught with\nbad luck from the statt.\nAfter our minibus booking\nwas rejected, we were left\nwith no alternative but to travel\nby car. One car containing\nour ' B' team arrived on\nSaturday at Bet wy syCo ed safely, but Alan Leakey's car containing the ' A' team\nfailed to get further than\nLower Neasden due to\n(they said) brake failure. It\nis more likely that they had found out about the forest in\nwhich the championship was\nheld. It turned out to be\nmostly very thick young\ntrees, and the tracks were\nno more run n able, as they\nwere full of tussock grass, so\nthat one fell flat on one's face every few paces. Nevertheless, the ' B' team manfully attempted the\ncourse that the ' A' team should\nhave run and Ian Isherwood\nsuccessfully completed the\nfirst leg. Pete Johnson on\nthe second leg had more\nTWO WEEKS ago four runners\ncrashed through the fairground\nat Horsham on their way to the\nchanging rooms to prepare for\nthe imminent start of the\n' Blue Star' 10 mile road race.\nFortunately for them 'Planet\nof the Apes'(?) delayed the\nstart by some 15 minutes,\nenabling Rob All in son to\nclear his system, or so\nhe thought....\nThe course was uphill for\nthe first four miles, then\nswiftly down to finish with a long, boring, undulating\nsection back into Horsham.\nPerhaps it wouldn't have been\nso bad if we hadn't passed so\nmany pubs\nDespite these, Steve Webb\nscored a rare victory over an ailing Rob Allison, completing\nthe course in 55.10 mins. This put him in 27th place.\nThe sight of all those\npubs on the course was just\ntoo much for use, and so\nseveral establishments had to\nbe visited which rounded off a pleasant days outing.\nResults: Steve'Webb. 55. t mins; Rob Allinson, 57.0 mins: Paul\nClarke, 61.1 mins: Pete\nJohnson, 69.5 mins.\ntrouble though, and after\nfinding four controls in\nabout 90 minutes, he noticed\nthat he was near the finish\nand decided to retire. Meanw hi le, John Gibbins had not\nwaited for Pete to finish, but\nhad already set off on the\nthird leg. John did slightly\nbetter, but the proximity of\nnightfall prevented him from\nfinding the last few controls.\nOn the Sunday, the Combined\nHarvesters' Trophy Event\nwas held where we did rather\nbetter. David Rosen won the\n' Elite' course by several\nminutes and Ian Isherwood\nand Pete Johnson both\ncompleted their courses in\nabout 120 minutes.\nOrienteering does not\ntake place only in term times,\nand PG members are active\nthroughout the vacations on\nmost Sundays.
