    "content": "22\nFASHION\nFashion Editor\nFashion Editor Kawai Wong\nKawai Wong\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 06 NOVEMBER 2009\nKarolina Kurkova is a new mum\nThe best Scottish designer\nAn upcoming superstar\nThe 28 year old MA graduate from\nCentral St. Martins, Mark Fast, is\ndefinitely a star to watch. His designs\nhave redefined the meaning of sexi-ness; his clingy numbers feature strategically placed holes that give a new\nmeaning to subtlety.\nArguably difficult to wear, his creations are strangely addictive. Every\ndress is made by the designer from the\nstart. Mark only works from the body\nwhich contributes to the signature fitted silhouette. In Mark\u2019s own words,\nhis designs are for \u201ca woman who\nknows exactly what she wants. She\ntakes risks\u201d. When he said she takes\nrisks, he meant it. In his first show\nin London Fashion Week last season,\nsome of his dresses barely covered the\nmodels\u2019 backsides.\nMark Fast\u2019s fame has been rapidly\nrising over the last six months. His\ndebut minimalist knit creations have\nquickly appeared in publications such\nas The New York Times and Vogue. A\nfew dresses from his first debut show\nhave since found homes in Kristen\nStewart and Ellen Page\u2019s wardrobe.\nMark\u2019s dresses did not stay long on\nBrowns\u2019 shelves \u2013 his last season\u2019s sas-sy, barely-there woven pieces quickly\nsold out within a week.\nBut Mark Fast\u2019s designs will soon\nbe available to everyone. Following\nthe footsteps of fellow designers such\nas Giles Deacon, Mark has secured a\ndeal with Topshop to make his pieces\navailable to the masses. According to\nGrazia, Mark\u2019s collection will launch\nin Feburary 2010.\nMark\u2019s spring-summer 2010 collection have used Swarovski crystals,\npearls, feathers and leather to maximise dimensions. The feathers give a\nmore feminine touch to his typically\ndetonatable dresses. The beads certainly give a somewhat 1920s touch to\nthe modernist collection, which also\nfeatured a dress beautifully decorated\nwith conically folded fabric.\nBesides the clothes, Mark Fast\ncaused controversy over the use of\nthree size 14 models on his recent cat-walk. His stylist walked out three days\nbefore the show, quoting \u201ccreative differences over the use of larger sized\nmodels\u201d. Mark\u2019s managing director,\nAmanda May, told the Telegraph that\n\u201cwe wanted women to know they don\u2019t\nhave to be a size zero to wear a Mark\nFast dress - curvier women can look\neven better in one\u201d. It is however undeniable that it can be a game of Truth\nor Dare for a curvier girl to step out in\na typical Mark Fast dress, since his designs can be quite revealing and curve\nhugging. Some people argue that the\nuse of size 0 and size 14 models only\n\u2013 with no variation in between \u2013 is a\npublicity stunt. But his move has surely\nopened the doors for plus-size models\non the catwalk. Definitely a gesture\nwelcomed by the fashion world.\nI\n\u2019ve embarked on a journey to find\nan outfit that will break the bank\n(it\u2019s Christmas!), and make me\nlook like a diva. I can only take\nadvice from Carine Roitfeld or Franca\nSozzani - mix it, match it, rock it and\nnever forget to romanticise it.\nMark Fast = Clothesgasm. I\u2019m completely smitten with this skirt. Totally\nromantic, totally 20s glam.\nNext - rock and roll. Adding safety\npins to my cotton biker jacket is something I tried to do, but this has failed to\nyield any success so far. How do these\ncrazy Moschino ateliers do it? Straight\nand neat?\nNext - fetish. How about a pair of\n12-inch, totally unwearable, but totally\nfabulous shoes from Alexander McQueen\u2019s SS10 RTW? I don\u2019t care if the\npair snap my feet in half, I don\u2019t care\nif they are more expensive than bailing\nout 10 banks- they are worth it.\nCompleting the look, I\u2019ll go for 3.1\nPhillip Lim\u2019s studded gloves. Keeps me\nwarm, keeps me edgy.\nLastly, a clutch bound by brass butchers chainmail by Made Her Think.\nSkirt, \u00a3540. Jacket, \u00a31705. Gloves,\n\u00a3325. Clutch,\n$1250. Shoes?\nPriceless. And\nSanta \u2013 Mastercard is\nhardly even\nmoney!\nCOOL WALL\nKawaiWong\nKawaiWong Fashion Editor\nNews Strip\nGabbyGentilcore\nGabbyGentilcore\nFashion Reporter\nCongratulations to supermodel and\nprevious VH1 Model of the Year, Karolina\nKurkova, who gave birth to a healthy\nbaby boy last week.\nDeryck Walker has won the Designer\nof the Year award for the second year\nrunning at the Scottish style awards.\nFounder of the Scottish style awards,\nMary Mcgowne, said that the awards\n\u201cvery much represented the face of\nmodern Scotland.\u201d Sophie Ellis-Bextor\nhosted the evening.\n\u201cLast season, some\nof his dresses\nbarely covered the\nmodels\u2019 derri\u00e8re\u201d\nClockwise from top: Mark Fast with\ntwo models at his studio; one of the\nplus size models that graced Mark\u2019s\ncatwalk this season; a floor length\nfrock from last season; this season\u2019s\ndresses are more decorated, as seen\nhere featuring conical folds.\nFrom top:\nMark Fast; 3.1\nPhillip Lim;\nMade Her Think;\nMoschino;\nMcQueen.\nBritain\u2019s own CDFA Fund\nThe British Fashion Council, in\ncollaboration with Vogue has launched\na \u00a3200,000 fund to help young British\ntalent.

    "content": "10 felix FRIDAY 06 NOVEMBER 2009\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT\nI\u2019m excited. Now calm down, there\u2019s\nno need for the hose yet. As a second\nyear, I have recently moved in with\nsome lazy, messy and slightly anaemic\nindividuals. They are otherwise known\nas housemates and they are kings\namong men.\nWe\u2019re still very much in the honeymoon period. The green shoots of democracy as everyone is assigned a shelf\nin the fridge. The beloved selection of\na stiff Caerphilly cheese from the dairy\naisle in Sainsburys. The furious wrath\nat waking to find a discarded wrapper\nand nothing more, with the obligatory witch-hunt. Secretly identifying\nthe culprit and the furtive thrill of re-venge; drinking the last of their milk\nin the middle of the night \u2013 and the\ncold sweat of terror as you realise that\nwasn\u2019t milk at all and had no business\nin the fridge to start with. It\u2019s a veritable cornucopia of emotion.\nBut in addition to these strange faces\nthat I must get used to outside the sober light of day, there is one other occupant of the house. One that I couldn\u2019t\nbe happier to be sharing a room with.\nHis name is Plant. He is a houseplant.\nI first met Plant in the gardening section at the B&Q back home, so, like\nme, he\u2019s a true Welshman. Admittedly,\nhe\u2019ll never play rugby in the Six Nations but he has a quiet charm. Plant\nsits at a mighty half-metre tall, in his\nwhite melamine pot, his endearingly\ndroopy leaves a sign of his relaxed,\nopen nature.\nWhat I like about Plant is that he\ndoesn\u2019t judge. I can come home in\nthe foulest of moods, vent at him to\ngeothermal proportions, practically\nscreaming. And when I finish, lungs\nbleeding, he just nods along with the\nair conditioning. Others might mistake\nhim as blas\u00e9 or apathetic, but they miss\nthe warm glow of gentle sympathy that\nsuffuses the room afterwards.\nIn Plant\u2019s opinion, my life is very\ncomplicated. And it\u2019s not hard to see\nwhy; university, lectures, medicine,\nfood, rent, bills, friends, keeping fit,\neating healthy, sleep and \u2013 here it gets\nreally complicated \u2013 girls. And, of\ncourse, the general head-scratchings of\nlife, the universe and everything. It\u2019s as\nknotty as a pair of snakes, just married,\nhoneymooning in a box of Christmas\nlights. Although, in fairness, Plant finds\nanything with legs complicated. Movement? \u2013 He baulks \u2013 \u2018Tis madness! So\nI have his pity. Plant is a simple thing,\nwith simple pleasures. Recumbent in\nhis plastic palace, he is free to spend\nthe day musing over matters that really\nmatter, like \u201cWhy is water wet?\u201d\nBut Plant is more than just a stem\nto cry on after a bad day. On the occasions that I am caught studying in my\nroom, Plant is a fine conversationalist\nto help those long hours fly by. He often tries to engage me by discussing his\nlatest philosophical ponderings but my\nfeeble human mind can barely keep up\nwith him at the best of times, let alone\nwhen it\u2019s trying to focus on adrenocep-tors and cerebral arteries. We also have\na good chat every week when I decide\nto water him. More often than not,\nwe end up talking about the weather,\nwhich we both have a vested interest\nin.\nWhat\u2019s more, as a housemate, Plant\nis exemplary. Unlike some, he never\ncontemplates kitchen theft and skul-duggery; he is always swift and efficient in the bathroom, and doesn\u2019t\nleave potting soil in the bottom of the\nshower; and he is always on time with\nthe rent. I don\u2019t ask where he gets the\nmoney from \u2013 some things are best left\nunknown.\nYou might be wondering by now, due\nto my hagiographic prose, why I didn\u2019t\njust move into a greenhouse? Valid\nquestion, and I must admit, though\nPlant is an outstanding individual and\na true friend, he is still a houseplant.\nNow, don\u2019t mistake me for some kind\nof bigot. I\u2019m the last person to judge\nsomeone based on the colour of their\nstem. But Plant is a plant, and I am \u2013\ncontrary to popular belief \u2013 a man.\nOur friendship may have done much\nto strengthen plant-human relations\nbut there are some differences that are\ntoo vast to be bridged by goodwill and\nMiracleGro.\nThe lack of opposable thumbs poses\na particular problem. Though I enjoy\nthe alien sensation of winning at Halo,\nit is a hollow victory. Plant holds little interest in video games, or in going\nout. It\u2019s as if he were rooted to the spot.\nIt\u2019s a real shame because he does appreciate a good pint of Guinness. But\nthese are relatively minor complaints\nthat I can ignore most of the time...\n...But when he gets drunk, he does\nlike to spoon.\nRhysDaviesliveswithaplant...Weird?\n\u201cIn Plant\u2019s opinion,\nmy life is very\ncomplicated. And\nit\u2019s not hard to see\nwhy; university,\nlectures, medicine,\nfood, rent...\u201d\nI\nLIKE ROUGH SEX. Yes I bet\nI\u2019ve got your attention now. If\nyou are stupid enough to read\nthis just because of the opening line then you are probably\na sexually deprived male Imperial student (of which there are many due to\nthe male: female ratio) or you are one\nof the slutty female freshers who are\nreally keen (if you have not done so al-ready) on losing their virginity.\nIs it me or is felix and the majority of\nthe student population of Imperial obsessed with sex? \u201cWhere\u2019s the weirdest\nplace you\u2019ve had sex?\u201d Urghh it makes\nme feel sick! Is that really what life revolves around? Do you really become\nmore interesting and are you really living life to the full if you fuck regularly?\nYes, fuck \u2013not make love. Because\nmaking love is something deeper, but\nin my experience the males I\u2019ve come\nacross here are not interested in that.\nMost just want one night stands and\nthose that pretend that they don\u2019t are\nreally just keeping a girlfriend so that\nthey can get regular fucks. They are\nnot interested in what music you\u2019re\ninto or what you did over summer, they\njust want an arse to squeeze and then\njust forget about it until next time.\nI\u2019m also disgusted with the recent intake of fresher girls that wear tops with\ntits falling out or dresses that reveal\nthongs! Get some class! Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I love dressing up and revealing\na bit of flesh, but everything in mod-eration. I am no nun. I am not a female\nscientist only devoted to her studies and the latest issue of Chemistry\nWorld. I believe physical relationships\ncan be great fun when they are with the\nright person. BUT that does not mean\nI give in to horny Imperial males on the\nprowl. I have some respect for myself\nand I am not ashamed to say that I am\nstill a virgin. Yes a virgin. I am proud\nthat I haven\u2019t given in because I am\nsimply waiting for the right person. Sex\nis not the way to start a relationship. It\nshould be brought into a relationship\nas a token of love and trust. And how\non earth are you meant to trust someone after a week or two, after meeting them at Fresher\u2019s Week? Many of\nmy friends have followed this trend as\nthey got caught up in the whirlwind\nof London uni life. But no honey \u2013no\nway- not me! I\u2019m starting to feel really\nashamed of some of my \u201cacquaintances\u201d, as I now like to call them, who need\nto take pregnancy or STI tests. If you\nwere in a stable relationship, planning\nproperly and actually not drunk off\nyour face most of the time when you\nhad sex then you wouldn\u2019t have this\nproblem!\nOh yes that brings me onto alcohol.\nWhy is the idea of a good night: one\nthat is a total piss up? Let me assure you\nthat I like alcohol. But I do not drink to\nget pissed. I have never lost control. I\nmay have drunk too much at times, but\nI did not set out to do this. I like the\ntaste of alcohol. I agree \u2013a drink does\nrelax you and being Italian and all...\nWell, red wine is in my blood. But it\nannoys me when I hear: \u201clast night was\namazing... tons of alcohol... woke up on\nthe common room floor...went to Hyde\nPark during the night...can\u2019t remember\nthe rest...\u201d WOW aren\u2019t you cool?! It\u2019s a\npity I can\u2019t even try to be just like you!\nI apologise to any males that I may\nhave offended during the voice of my\nhumble opinion. I know that there are\nsome decent blokes out there at Imperial \u2013after all - probability distributions\napproach the x axis, but never quite\nreach it. You must be somewhere in\nthe tail of the Gaussian. Shame really\n-isn\u2019t it? But don\u2019t try and contact me\n\u2013I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019m too busy trying to convince my demonstrators that\nmy recent laboratory work is one of a\nkind and actually deserves the Nobel\nprize. I\u2019m not going to bother apolo-gising to any promiscuous girls I may\nhave offended \u2013just \u2018cause you should\nknow better.\nMariashNotellingalreadyknowsbetter\n\u201c I feel ... ashamed\nof some of my\n\u201cacquaintances\u201d,\nas I now like to call\nthem, who need to\ntake pregnancy or\nSTI tests\u201d\n\n"

We loved you, we lost you.\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2009.\nA consortium of 12 European companies has launched\na sustainable energy initiative to source European energy from the Sahara desert.\nThe Desertec Industrial Initiative will start with a solar power project based in North Africa which is expected to meet\n15% of Europe\u2019s energy needs\nby 2050. It will require $400bn (\u00a3240) in investment, which will be provided\nby companies including Deutsche Bank, Siemens, and E.On. The consortium\nwill be based in Munich, where one of the initiative\u2019s founders, Munich Re,\nis based. Throughout North Africa and the Middle East, vast arrays of solar-thermal plants, which direct the sun\u2019s light to heat water, will produce energy\nthroughout the day (and night). The super-heated water will drive steam turbines to generate electricity. A network of hi-tech cables which limit conductive loss will then transmit the electricity back to Europe across the Mediterranean. Desertec has stressed that some of the power generated by the Sahara\nsolar fields will also be used to power North African countries directly.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont, International Editor\nHamid Karzai has been declared president of Afghanistan after officials\nscrapped the second round of voting.\nThe second round, which was due to be held on November 7th, would have\nseen Hamid Karzai pitted against his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, but the\nlatter withdrew from the race earlier this week. The first round saw Mr Karzai come in with just under the 50% of the votes required to avoid a run-off,\nwhilst his opponent obtained just under a third of the votes. Hundreds of\nthousands of ballots were discounted because of fraud allegations during the\nmarred elections. Indeed, Hamid Karzai lost a third of his votes between the\nfirst and final counts. A day into his new five-year term, the President vowed\nto battle corruption, and to lead an inclusive government. He also renewed\nhis call for the Taliban fighters to put down their arms, but they quickly replied that they would continue their fight against the \u2018puppet government\u2019.\nMr Karzai\u2019s pledge to root out corruption from his own government will be\nclosely watched by his American allies, as President Obama is considering\nsending 40,000 more troops to fight in the country.\nAfghanistan\nThe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) hosted a summit\nlast week which also included some of the regions heavy-weights, China\nand Japan.\nSouth-East Asian countries are either rapidly recovering from the recent\neconomic crisis or have avoided it altogether. But the financial mess brought\non by America has certainly succeeded in renewing talk of a free-trade zone\nthat would link the world\u2019s most dynamic economies. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister\nYukio Hatoyama has said that such a zone should have a single currency and\n\u2018lead the world\u2019. Over the past decade, ASEAN has made much progress in reducing tariffs, particularly on manufactured goods, but has so far avoided reforming trade regulation on farm imports. Intra-East Asian trade flows rose\nto 42% of total trade in 2008, up from 32% in 1990, according to the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and there is scope for further improvement.\nAll this talk of economic rapprochement is nothing new, and to some observers seems to be nothing more than a distant vision. Indeed, political\ndisputes within the region are as hot as ever, particularly between Thailand,\nwhere the summit took place, and neighbouring Cambodia.\nThe two countries\u2019 armies have clashed several times over a disputed temple at the border.\nSouth East Asia\nEurope\nL\nast Friday saw the announcement of the Central Union\nelection results. The newly\nelected students are now full\nmembers of Council. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Council is\nthe sovereign policy-making body for\nour Union; it is a place that tends to\nencourage democracy and civilised\ndiscussion (for the most part) on issues that affect students. The newly\nelected members have as their duty to\nrepresent the views of the student constituents of their Faculty and do so at\nmonthly meetings.\nAccording to an email sent out by\nMark Chamberlain, last year\u2019s Medic\nPresident and this year\u2019s Council\nChair, the elections were not without\nhiccups. In said e-mail, an allusion was\nmade to the fact that there were indeed\nClass of 2010 Councillors elected\nAfonso Campos reports on a new team to attend Council this year\nissues that needed to be looked into\nby saying that \u201ccomplaints have been\ndealt with\u201d. felix is unaware of what issues there were.\nAs usual, there are some positions\nthat remain yet to be filled; six in total\nthis year. The Non-Faculty position,\noftentimes taken up by the current\nfelix editor has not been filled either.\nIt is understandable as this position\nis not open to a very great number of\nstudents. You can still stand for election in any of these empty Councillor\npositions. Refer to the table on the left\nto see exactly what roles are still va-cant. There is further information on\nCouncil and the roles you can run for\non http://www.imperialcollegeunion.\norg/representation. To stand, email\nthe Council Chair your small manifesto as soon as possible, stating why\nyou would make a good representative\nand come along to the next Council\nmeeting.\nIf you have any issues that you would\nlike to see raised in Council, you are\nwelcome to attend and make your\nvoice heard. The meetings are open to\nall members of Imperial College Union and everyone has a say. If you feel\nparticularly strongly about an issue,\nyou may also write a paper and see it\ndebated and voted upon. It is suggested you approach one of your Faculty\ncouncillors (list in the box on the left)\nand speak to them about your paper.\nSo you have an idea, in the past, Council has discussed varied issues such as\nthe Beer Tax, the twinning of Imperial\nCollege Union with other universities\nin Gaza and as recently as this week,\nthe status of mitigating circumstances\nfor students sitting exams.\nAlternatively, you can just come\nalong and watch the evening\u2019s antics.\nIt can be fun and there\u2019s tea and coffee.\nThe new councillors will be joining Union President Ashley Brown and Council\nChair Mark Chamberlain.

    "content": "20 felix FRIDAY 06 NOVEMBER 2009\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMUSIC\nR\nodrigo Braga is a Brazilian taught-postgraduate in\nthe chemistry department\nwhose experience of paradise\nin the middle of the Pacific inspired\nhim to write his debut album about\nthe fact that life really ain\u2019t so bad. As\ninspiration goes, that\u2019s pretty ace and\nthe easy, beach-living coconut filled\nworld of the Pacific comes flowing out\nof his melodic soul offerings. The music fills the room and hangs about the\nair around you, never directly jabbing\nyou in the face but instead creating an\natmosphere of tangible warmth. \u201cEagle\nBay\u201d is a prime example of this, washing away your troubled thoughts with a\nlittle latin-inspired guitar. He\u2019s playing\nat Belushi\u2019s the next two Wednesdays\nso there\u2019s ample opportunity to catch\nhim swooning with his Spanish guitar.\nHis album \u201cBetween the Waves\u201d is free\nto download from his website.\nRodrigo Braga Imperial Talent Kitty Magic\nT\no be honest, I didn\u2019t think\nthat a bunch of third year\nMechanical Engineers could\nuse forks and knives, never\nmind make music but I stand cor-rected. Kitty Magic, consisting by Ed\nBishop, Tim Sadler, Ben Copping and\nErik Forman are an indie-pop band\nformed earlier this year who have recently released their 1st EP \u201cAvoid 10\nRillington Place\u201d and while their song\n\u201cNever You Mind\u201d strays dangerously\nclose to The Maccabees before they\nwere good, \u201cBar Mitzvah Blues\u201d demonstrates the band\u2019s energetic talents\nwhile \u201cSmall Town Trap\u201d is a poignant\nheart-grabbing tune. The band are ultimately enjoyable and display a talent\nfor song-writing but they hardly represent a re-invention of indie-pop music.\nThat said, they\u2019re good enough to bag\na gig at The Hoxton Underbelly next\nWednesday, so what do I know?\nA\nperformance at the Royal\nAlbert Hall is usually no\nquiet affair for both artist\nand audience. This Thursday night saw the absence of crowds of\npeople waiting on the grand staircase\nleading up to the Royal Albert Hall.\nInstead, a considerably smaller huddle\ncould be found murmuring with some\nexcitment within the second floor hallways of London\u2019s famous concert and\nperformance venue.\nThe Hush gigs are a revamped series\nof small, intimate nights in the Edgar\nRoom, which was previously a dining\narea. Hush invites newly-signed artists\nto play in front of a mixed crowd that\nsamples each sector of the gig-going\ndemographic.\nThe latest to be added to London\u2019s\nroster of gig venues is incredibly inviting with its carpeted floors, soft lighting and homely atmosphere. In a room\nthat could pass off as your own living\nroom, the walls are adorned by mounted canvases of musical legends. The\nBeatles, Pavaroti and James Brown are\njust a few of the artists silently surveying the young acts on stage.\nFirst on was Jose Vanders; the teenager seemed incredibly overwhelmed\nand calm at the same time. However,\nHer personality left more of an impression than her performance; her songs\nwere decidedly samey and hovered\naround the same subjects.\nJonathan Jeremiah followed Miss.\nVanders on stage after a short interval,\nHush @ The Royal Albert Hall\nbut unfortunately left with the crowd\nwith less to talk about. Although enjoyable in an alarmingly background-music way, comparisons were drawn to\nKings of Leon, albiet without their at-tention-catching Southern twang that\nis so evident throughout their tracks.\nFinishing off the night was Alan\nPownall. His troubled demeanour settled quite differently from his skinny\njeans, cardigan and closely cropped\nblonde hair. Unlike the previous two\nartists on stage before him, he turned\nmany a head as he casually stepped\nonto stage and introduced himself.\nHe produced an impressive serenity in\nthe room with his acoustic guitar and\nsofty-straining voice. Despite a largely\nsatisfying performance, there were\nonly glimmers of anything special that\nmay place him apart from similar artists in the catergory in which David\nGray and John Mayer lay claim to.\nThe informality of the night were in\nstark contrast to Imperial College\u2019s\ngraduation ceremony held at the Albert Hall the day before. The audience\nwww.rodrigobraga.co.uk www.myspace.com/kittymagic\nwas split between sitting comfortably\non the floor and standing uninhibited at the back thanks to the free\ncloakroom.\nThis Hush gig was truly saved by the\nvenue\u2019s relaxing and friendly atmos-phere. The cheap drink prices probably\nhelped a little bit too. - Dan Wan\nJose Vanders looks a little bit like a squirrel, no?

Treasury minister Liam Byrne claimed that\nShadow Chancellor George Osborne\nhad made a \u201ccomplete clown of himself\u201d for suggesting that the Government\u2019s plan to end the recession had\n\u201cfailed\u201d\n. Criticism has also been coming,\nas always, from the Lib Dems who saw\n\u201cstark contrast\u201d between the performances of the UK and US economies.\nMr Byrne made three arguments in\nfavour of his government\u2019s interven-tionism. His first was that US politicians and their advisors had \u201csaid the\nstimulus was vital\u201d. His second point\nwas that some countries that implemented stimulus packages had seen\ntheir economies\u2019 key indicators pick\nup. He argued that these \u201cshow one\nthing above all - that economic stimulus has worked.\u201d Finally he pointed out\nthat Barack Obama (in so many words)\nsupported economic stimulus as a tool\nto hasten economic recovery.\nLib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince\nCable has been broadly supportive of\nthe government\u2019s policies but has challenged the effectiveness of their imple-mentation. He has additionally called\nfor the financial sector to be shrunk,\nrelative to the overall size of the econo-my. He also wants consumer and business loans to become more accessible,\nand personal debt to go down. His proposals have some credibility because of\nhis partial prediction of the financial\ncrisis.\nMr Osborne was the only politician\nto oppose quantitative easing and bank\nUK opposition parties criticise the slow recovery from recession, Lord Sugar denies it exists and suggests we do\nthe same, Intel gets prosecuted \u2013 again, gold marches on, and Shanghai may be getting a Disneyland\nClockwise from top left: George Osborne, Vince Cable, the wrong Liam Byrne, Treasury minister Liam Byrne\nAlan Sugar, of The Apprentice fame,\nmade controversial comments on\nTuesday that seemed to imply that\nsmall businesses hit hard by the recession should not be complaining.\n\u201cI can honestly say a lot of problems\nyou hear from people who are moaning are from companies I wouldn\u2019t\nlend a penny to,\u201d said Lord Sugar, who\nhas recently become the government\u2019s\nenterprise advisor. \u201cThey are bust and\nthey don\u2019t need the bank - they need an\ninsolvency practitioner,\u201d he added.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses\ndefended small firms struggling to\nsurvive under current conditions by\nclaiming that small businesses \u201clive in\nthe real world, not Disney World, and\nthey lie at the heart of our economy\u201d,\nadding that \u201cthey are not moaners and\nthe fact is they are working hard in difficult times and they need help from\nour banks.\u201d Lord Sugar\u2019s criticisms of\nthe \u2018moaners\u2019 comes amidst his calls for\npeople to stop discussing the recession.\nWhen asked about how the UK can get\nout of it, he argued \u201cah \u00a3$%^&* can we\nget off this bloody recession kick once\nand for all? I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in one\nnow, okay?\u201d\nHe has even been blaming the current state of the economy on its cov-erage, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s about time\nthe media really assisted a little bit [by]\nnot talking about the recession.\u201d Lord\nSugar offered small enterprises more\nconciliatory words by claiming that\nthey do not need to be told that times\nare tough. \u201cIt\u2019s the businessman, err, or\nbail-outs but has, without formally retracting his position, increasingly shied\naway from discussing his earlier pro-posals, on account of public opinion\nbeing strongly hostile towards them.\nHe has however been reminding voters\nof the Prime Minister\u2019s earlier claims\nand his role in shaping the UK economy in the eleven years before the start\nof recession. \u201cGordon Brown\u2019s claim\nthat we were \u2018best placed\u2019 now lies in\ntatters\u201d said Mr Osborne, arguing that\n\u201cwe need credit and confidence to get\nthe British economy moving again.\u201d\nIronically these latest spats has been\ncatalyzed by figures showing the US\nrecovering faster than the UK, which\nare themselves highly suspicious. Even\non the Federal Government\u2019s dubious\nnumbers, unemployment continues to\nrise \u2013 although TARPisans like to argue that the rate of increase (or some\nhigher order derivative depending on\nthe month) of unemployment is falling.\nIn the financial markets, speculation\nis strong and growing that the nominal gap between asset and real economic performance is being caused by\ngovernment-pumped money. Evidence\nsupporting this view includes the un-precedentedly high ratio between the\nscale of the recovery and the depth of\nthe initial correction.\nThis creates a dilemma. There will\nprobably be an eventual withdrawal of\nliquidity in order to reduce the risk of\nexcessive inflation. But this will cause\nanother painful market correction,\npotentially sparking another round of\nprinting. These concerns have caused\nthe surge in currencies traditionally\nviewed as risky to continue this week,\nas the doubts rise about the USD\u2019s\nsafe-haven status.\nUK will recover slower than US\nJust months after paying the EU almost\n\u00a31bn, Intel faces yet another lawsuit.\nThis time it has been filed by New\nYork\u2019s Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, following a two year investigation.\nPresumably soon-to-be-Governor Cuomo is accusing Intel of \u201cillegal threats...\nbribery and coercion.\u201d The alleged\nvictims are manufacturers of personal\ncomputers who Intel apparently tried to\nintimidate into buying its chips instead\nof those made by its rivals. This would\nhave been a novel marketing strategy,\nbut its effectiveness is doubtful given\nthe size of most PC manufacturers.\nIntel responded that the lawsuit was\n\u201cjust plain wrong...consumers, who have\nconsistently benefited from lower prices\nand increased innovation, are not being\nserved by the decision to file a case now.\u201d\nThe details of the case are even more\nbizarre. Intel\u2019s super-awesome plans\nto dominate its market were undone\nby its staff mentioning them in emails.\nThe \u2018bribery and coercion\u2019 turn out to\nhave been cash-back offers. The \u2018illegal\nthreats\u2019 were to withdraw these offers if\nthe manufacturers switched suppliers.\nthe businesswoman, who has to run\ntheir business, and adapt to the climate\nthat they are in at the moment.\u201d The\nLib Dem\u2019s business spokesman John\nThurso warned the Prime Minister not\nto \u201callow Lord Sugar\u2019s celebrity to distract him from the absolutely desperate message this sends.\u201d Showing the\nfull force of his party\u2019s wit he added, \u201cif\nhe cannot get this, the Prime Minister\nmust tell him \u2018you\u2019re fired\u2019.\u201d\nGold prices have hit an all time high of\n$1095.05 for an ounce on the London\nmarket, after the Indian Central Bank\npurchased 200 tonnes of the precious\nmetal from the International Monetary\nFund.

    "content": "17\nfelix FRIDAY 6 NOVEMBER 2009\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFantasy and magic amid natural history\nChristopher Self finds himself spellbound by nature at this year\u2019s Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition\nI\nt was my understanding that\nwildlife photography involves\nlots of waiting around, sitting\nhoping that Mother Nature will\nsmile on you and all the unpredictable little elements will come together to create a nice composition. If\nthat really is what it comes down to I\ncan\u2019t imagine the hours, days and years\nthat must have been invested to bring\nus this year\u2019s Natural History Museum\nWildlife Photographer of the Year ex-hibition. There\u2019s probably three medieval cathedrals in that room, that and\nenough luck to win the national lottery\nevery week and fluke your way through\nexams all the way to graduation.\nThat having been said there is absolutely nothing lucky about the sheer\nquality of the work on display here.\nFor those unaware, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition is\nan international showcase for the very\nbest of natural photography. It\u2019s run\nannually by the museum in conjunction with BBC\u2019s wildlife magazine and,\ncurrently enjoying its 45th year, has\nlong been considered the most prestigious competition of its kind. Winning\nit really is the ultimate recognition of\nyour talent as a wildlife photographer\nand this year\u2019s entries show every bit of\nthat pedigree.\nThere are truly breathtaking images\nhere, incredible examples of the split\nsecond timings required, and photos\nof all scales and from all parts of the\nworld. Startling pictures such as that of\nan ant drinking a raindrop off a mar-row, a leopard darting face first down a\ntree, the light reflections playing off the\nindividual feathers on a greenfinches\nchest, this list goes on. You could\nspend hours enjoying just the pictures\nthemselves, but of course that would\nbe only half the magic. Along with\nevery photograph is a little anecdote\nwritten by the photographer about the\nimage and a little bit of background\non the animal, or the encounter, or\nthe location. And these charming little titbits really do add a lot. They give\nyou a sense of the incredible accidental stories you are witnessing unfold.\nFor example, the story of the fighting\ntigers \u2013 in itself an incredible image,\ncaptured perfectly. But along with the\nknowledge that the brawlers are fighting territorially and the loser will never\nstop returning, because she is fighting her mother, it is transformed into\nsomething spectacular.\nWildlife photography often has a\ntouch of the fantastical about it: a\nmagical air, as if looking into a different\nworld, a world more incredible than\nany fiction. There is no shortage of this\nin this year\u2019s exhibition; the technique\nof backlighting the images for presentation lends them an added sparkle of\nenchantment. This, for a small minority of the work, perhaps detracts from\nits purpose as wildlife photography,\nallowing them to be separated off into\nthe realm of fantasy, something I\u2019m\nnot sure is really what was aimed for,\nparticularly in a contest considering\nthe majesty of the natural world and, of\ncourse, carrying the implied message\nthat this world really deserves saving\nfrom the great modern evils such as\nclimate change. If the images looks too\ncinematic, too make-believe, it is difficult to associate them with real forests\nand jungles that really do need saving.\nThis year\u2019s winner encapsulates all of\nthese various ideas perfectly. A photo\ncalled The Storybook Wolf, it depicts an\nIberian grey wolf jumping a fence into\nSpanish farmland. You really have to\nsee the picture to get a true sense of the\nmagical feel it possesses; it looks as if\nit\u2019s been lifted from the pages of a fairy\ntale. But this is balanced against the reality of the persecution of these same\nwolves owing to the effect they have\non farmer\u2019s livestock, which they hunt\nwhen food is scarce. The juxtaposition of the incredible beast against the\nclearly unnatural elements of the farmland backdrop ensure that the meaning\nof the image never leaves your mind,\neven as you admire the enchanted feel\ning it possesses. Meaning as well as being an incredible picture, it leaves you\nconsidering the effect on natural populations when they quite literally collide\nwith human settlement.\nThe whole thing doesn\u2019t take a massive amount of time to look around.\nYou could probably do it over a lunch\ntime if you wanted, and now with a new,\ngreener, sponsor there\u2019s no real reason\nnot to go. A brief look at the combined\nresult of all that effort, which in its own\nway is much more striking and beautiful than those three hypothetical cathedrals ever could have been, it really\nis well worth the \u00a34.50 entry fee.\nAs with all NHM special exhibits\nthe entrance to the exhibit is done on\ntimed entry i.e. you book an entrance\ntime and come back then to look\naround, which you may do for as long\nas you like.\nThe Wildlife Photographer of the Year\nexhibition now has a greener sponsor:\nVeolia Environment.\nUntil 11 April 2010 at the Natural History Museum\nC\nurrently on display in\nthe British Library is a\nmanuscript dating back\none thousand years. Surviving both Henry VIII\u2019s\nransacking of the monasteries and a\nfire in 1731, the three thousand line\nmanuscript has enabled the ancient\nheroic poem of Beowulf to be passed\non through centuries, to still be revered today and cited as one of the\nmost significant works in Anglo-Saxon\nliterature \u2212 and all this by chance. No\nwonder, then, that arguments about\nits origin, interpretation, significance\nand descent down generations prevail\namong literary scholars. Last Tuesday\nwas no exception when an audience\nat the British Library and presenter\nMichael Wood joined poet and Nobel Prize winner Seamus Heaney,\nchildren\u2019s author Michael Morpurgo\nand performer Benjamin Bagby in an\nevening celebrating this Anglo-Saxon\nepic.\nBelieved to be set in the 5th cen-tury, the poem is set in both Sweden\nand Denmark. The King of the Geats,\nHrothgar, is plagued by Grendel and\nsees his court at Heorot devoured\nnightly by the monster. Hearing of his\ndistress, the Swede Beowulf travels to\nDenmark to rid the King of his men-ace. Beowulf is successful and slaughters Grendel without weapons but has\nto face Grendel\u2019s mourning mother the\nfollowing night. Again victorious, Beowulf returns to Sweden only to fight\na dragon who has been rudely awoken\nby a thief in its gold filled lair. Beowulf\nis fatally wounded and dies a hero\u2019s\ndeath.\nThe epic poem would have been\nimmortalised through the decades by\n\u201cscops\u201d, a breed of bardic storytellers in\nthe Oral Tradition. However, there is\nmuch controversy about whether the\nmanuscript as it stands in the British\nLibrary was written by a contemporary\nas a satire of the tradition or as a direct\n\u2018transcript\u2019 of the poem. The precise\ndate that the poem was written down\nis subject to much speculation but is\nmost likely to have been between the\neight and eleventh centuries, written in\nthe West Saxon and Anglian dialects of\nOld English \u2212 the language in which it\nwould have been performed \u2212 using a\nset poetic meter.\nIt is the role of scop that Bagby assumes as he performs an excerpt of\nthe poem: the bloodthirsty pillage of\nHeorot by Grendel. Having no idea\nof exactly what the poem would have\nsounded like one thousand years ago is\nof no impediment to Bagby who compares the manuscript to a cubist paint-ing: most of the interpretation is up to\nus! Half spoken and half sung, the meter comes alive through Bagby\u2019s deep\nvoice, accompanied by the atmospheric playing of his lyre. Although sounding more Danish than Old English,\nhearing the poem recited in such a way\nwas mesmerising.\nSeamus Heaney and the wonderfully\nentertaining Michael Morpurgo\u2019s readings of their own translations (both\ntranslations retain the original meter)\nwere beautiful and hearing them aloud\nmade this medieval world of monsters\nand heroes all the more tangible. The\nreadings were followed by a discussion amongst the panel in which much\nThe winning photograph, The Storybook Wolf, by Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez\ndisdain was shown for the 2007 film\nversion starring the gold stocking clad\nAngelina Jolie as Grendel\u2019s mother. So\nwould it be possible to make a genuinely frightening film version of Beowulf?\nThe only way to make it work as a film\nwould be to strip to down to its bare\nelements: no Hollywood glamour, low\nbudget, black and white, Morpurgo replies to my question.\nAn event combining such rich discussion brought so much to the enjoyment and appreciation of the legacy\n\u2212 enough to make anyone lament the\ndecline in storytelling today.\nTo see Bagby\u2019s version of Beowulf: bagbybeowulf.com\nGo and see the 1000 year old Beowulf manuscript at the British\nLibrary, King\u2019s Cross, for free\nAs part of four days of events to celebrate Britain\u2019s oldest folk legend, Caz Knight attends the British Museum\nto listen to three agile minds exploring the legacy of Beowulf\nBrave Swedes, monsters & blood-shed\n\n"

Everyone at Imperial has\nheard the same comment about the union,\n\u201cit....is....shit\u201d.\nThroughout my first year it was all\nI heard, and in a bid to look \u201ccool\u201d in\nfront of a bunch of strangers, I would\nagree, and maybe even spread the\nword. I started saying the union was\nshit before I had even been there.\nOver my time I have found it as\nsomething of a conversation starter,\nalmost a pick-up line. All girls in the\nunion love a man who hates the union.\nIt\u2019s a common topic among everyone\nwho visits, and it sort of unifies us as\na group. Maybe that\u2019s why people say\nit so much. However my fresher days\nare over. Now in 2nd year I find myself\na tad older and wiser and am willing to\nvoice my true opinion about the bar at\nthe back end of Beit quad. I LOVE IT!!!\nI literally cannot think of anywhere else\nI would like to go out more, and it\u2019s not\nfollowed by a \u2018lol\u2019 so yes, I really am\nserious.\nEveryone always focuses on the\nnegative points, like how ridiculously\nheavy the stools in Da Vinci\u2019s are, the\npermanent smell of vomit in the union\nbar, or the pints of piss courtesy of the\nrugby team.\nBut what about the positives? The\nunion doesn\u2019t care about my type of\nshoes or if I\u2019m wearing a hoody, I probably wouldn\u2019t get a second look if I\nstrolled in wearing a Borat mankini, in\nfact I think it has been done. In the union you really can do almost anything\nshort of murder and not get kicked out.\nWhere else can you get service with a\nsmile after having just thrown up your\nguts on Beit lawn? Now dBs\u2019 dance\nfloor gets a lot of bad press, however\nI haven\u2019t seen many better. There is\nnothing more annoying than a packed\ndance floor, and dBs is never packed.\nI always find space to swing my arms\nin some ridiculous fashion and call\nit a form of dancing. And so what if\nthe music isn\u2019t great, if you\u2019re sober\nenough to notice, you\u2019re not drunk\nenough to be in dBs.\nI could go on all day: you never have\nto queue to get in, the cloakroom is\nfree, and they have the quickest most\nhygienic hand driers in the world.\nOn top of all of this, it\u2019s pretty cheap.\nReally, where else can you go on a\nWednesday night where it is not only\nacceptable to do condom pints, but\nencouraged? How can you hate a place\nthat serves your beer in a plastic skiff\nso once you\u2019re done you can throw it\nback in the faces of the bar staff that\nserved you? Then later at the end of\na long night, there\u2019s no issue getting\nhome, if I\u2019m feeling paralytic there\u2019s a\ndirect night bus that takes me to my\nfront door, and I can walk it if I\u2019m feeling active.\nSo, no one would\u2019ve thought it, but\nthe best night out in London town is\nthe Imperial College Union.\nJaideepDesai\u2019sconfession:I theUnion\n\u201cI probably\nwouldn\u2019t get\na second look\nif I strolled in\nwearing a Borat\nmankini, in fact I\nthink it has been\ndone.\u201d\n\u2665\nA\nfew years ago, following\nthe atrocities committed by foreign citizens on\nAmerican soil, President\nGeorge W. Bush declared\na global war on tourism. Tourism and\ntourists, he claimed in his distinctively\nchirpy Texan accent, needed to be\nstopped at whatever cost. Whether hiding behind Lonely Planet guidebooks in\ncheap hotels or skulking in queues for\ndiscount theatre tickets, tourists had to\nbe identified, disarmed and eliminated.\nIn an unparalleled act of unity, virtually the entire Western world responded\nto this clarion call for peace and secu-rity. As a result, the last few years have\nseen life become increasingly difficult\nfor rogue tourists hell-bent on overturning our normal way of life. Increased security at airports, tighter control over\nentry visas and a tougher economic\nclimate have all contributed to preventing the scourge of international tourism\nfrom rearing its ugly head. Soon even\nthe silly hats, \u2018I Love London\u2019 T-shirts,\nunnecessarily large cameras and loud\nvoices that constitute the most powerful weapons of mass distraction will be\neradicated, and ordinary people will be\nable to go about their daily lives without\nfear of disruption.\nAs a reformed tourist myself, I understand all too well the appalling conditions that drive perfectly ordinary people to strap themselves into a seatbelt\nand leave their baggage unattended\nin the hold of a transnational airliner.\nTheir actions may seem disgusting and\nrepellent to us, but we must be tolerant,\nand strive to remember that it is simply\nnot their fault. Their vile and reprehensible activities are motivated by a genuine feeling of desperation, expressed\nthrough the only means of communication they feel is open to them.\nIf we are to put an end to this men-ace, we have to act with delicacy, professionalism and caution. And what\nbetter example to follow than that of\nLondon\u2019s very own Metropolitan police\nforce? The London Met\u2019s counter-tour-ism program has been exceptionally ef-fective, with its four-stage slogan for reducing the spread of the tourism virus:\n\u2018catch it, kill it, bin there, done that\u2019\n.\nIt is a testament to the gravity of the\nthreat involved that all branches of government and industry have contributed\nto seeking out these unwelcome visitors\nto our shores. No single body, however,\nhas done more to help in the identification of tourists than the Royal Mint.\nCenturies of experience have resulted in\nthe manufacture of the most confusing\nset of circulating coinage known to man,\nand the ingenious practice of pricing\neveryday items at such arbitrary figures\nas \u00a37.28 or \u00a33.43. This forces the uninitiated to deal with overflowing handfuls\nof loose change which they are then unable to identify. All that the rest of us\nthen have to do is keep our ears peeled\nfor anyone who walks down the road\nmaking a noise like a gypsy tambourin-ist falling down a hill.\nEven British Airways has in part\natoned for its role in facilitating the\ninflux of tourists by financing the construction of a giant detention and isolation facility on London\u2019s South Bank.\nKnown as the \u2018London Eye\u2019\n, the giant circular structure serves as a centre where\nsuspected tourists can be kept off the\nstreets in a closely monitored environment for half an hour at a time. Once\nthey emerge, dizzy and mildly disori-ented, it is a comparatively easy task to\npush them into the raging waters of the\nRiver Thames.\nBut perhaps the most impressive precaution employed by the city of London\nis Madame Tussaud\u2019s. Behind the story\nof this feeble waxworks we see the true\npower of marketing, a brute force capable of transforming a pointless and\nvapid attraction into one of the city\u2019s\nmost visited sites. But why? What is the\npurpose of dragging foreigners to such a\nhideously vulgar waste of time? The answer is simple. Once used to display the\nremains of executed French nobles, it\nhas now regained its original purpose as\na final destination for unwanted foreign-ers. The innate ability of Londoners to\nrespond to a crisis situation means that\nstandard policy has long been to slyly\ndirect all potential tourists towards the\nBaker Street area. The brightly-coloured\nlabyrinth of the London Tube map has\ngreatly facilitated this subtle shepherd-ing, as after ten minutes underground\nnot even the keenest orienteer has any\nidea where the hell they are, where\nthey\u2019re going, or what fresh air used to\ntaste like.\nOnce a tourist arrives at Madame Tussaud\u2019s, after expecting to find himself at\nHarrods or the Millenium Dome, he is\nquietly and discreetly shown into the\ncellars, melted down, and recast into the\nlatest mould of Nick Griffin or Susan\nBoyle. This way the museum is able to\ncut down on its wax consumption, and\ncan continue to provide among the most\nrealistic dummies in the world.\nAll that is now left to do, of course, is\nto combat the horrors of British tourism\nexported abroad. The shutting down\nof the renowned British tourism training camps and a crackdown on the infamous and devastating tactic of binge\ndrinking will surely go a long way to\nmaking tomorrow\u2019s world a safer and\nless gaudy place. We can but hope.\nGilead Amit and the global war on tourism\n\u201cSoon their weapons\nof mass distraction\nwill be eradicated,\nand ordinary people\nwill go about their\ndaily lives without\nfear of disruption.\u201d\n\n"

The event\nhad been organised by Imperial College Political Philosophy Society in\nconjunction with Palestinian societies\nfrom across London universities, and\nfelix was lucky enough to attend.\nProfessor Chomsky began his talk\nby discussing the Iranian situation, in\nparticular given current concerns over\nits nuclear program. He was clearly\nconcerned about the reaction of Western governments and media, which he\ncharacterised as \u2018fear-mongering.\u2019\nThe focus of this part of the talk was\nthat Iran poses no significant threat to\nWestern interests, both in general and\nspecifically with the nuclear issue. He\nfurther noted the danger of ignoring\nwhat he viewed as more immediate\nconcerns over Israel and India by keeping attention exclusively on Iran.\nProfessor Chomsky continued the\ntheme started by Tariq Ali in his introductory speech, who had reminded the\naudience of Iran\u2019s role in stabilising the\nconditions of Iraq and Afghanistan. He\ncautioned against negative sentiments\ntowards, and approached praising,\nIran as a nation whilst distinguishing\nbetween it and its current government.\nHe focused his blame for such sentiments squarely on the media and\nwarned that it could clear the way\nfor additional sanctions, including\nmilitary. Having written extensively\nthroughout his career about the excessively cosy relationship between Big\nGovernment and its Big Media, as he\nsees it, this was a natural argument for\nhim to make.\nAccording to Chomsky, since 2007\nthe media has been set on a policy of\ndemonising Iran, \u201cthe most ominous\nissue of today\u201d. Front-page headlines\nwere about Iran defying the world\ncommunity and seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and relating to whether\nte US and Israel should attack.\nChomsky accuses the Governmentled media of shifting the general\npopulation towards fear of Iran, whilst\nnot reporting on almost scandalous\nbehaviour such as Israel not signing\nup to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty and Obama making clear to\nthem that it didn\u2019t apply to them.\nA week before being inaugurated,\nObama was saying that Iran was going to be a problem despite reports\nfrom US intelligence saying that Iran\nhad stopped its nuclear proliferation\nin 2003. This was hardly reported in\nthe media and the only answer from\nthe White House as to why they were\nignoring this intelligence information,\naccording to Chomsky, was that they\ndidn\u2019t like the intelligence estimates\nwhich they were rejecting.\nAnother example of this apparent\nhushing-up of unfavourable stories\nwhich Professor Chomsky brought up\nis the apparent scandal around Palestinian offshore gas. According to re-ports, the Palestinian Authority granted exploration rights in 1999 to 60%\nof Palestinian offshore gas reserves to\nBritish Gas and a partner company.\nHowever, since the election of the Hamas government, Israel has taken control of the gas reserves.\nThere was talk of Tony Blair\u2019s involvement in dealings with BG regarding a possible deal to pump gas to\nEgypt, in that he halted these proceedings on behalf of Israel. Later, despite\na proposed agreement that would see\na one billion dollar profit go to Palestinians in exchange for gas, it was then\nstated that Palestinians would only be\n\u201cpaid in goods and services\u201d as Israel\nwanted to ensure that \u201cno money go to\nthe Hamas-controlled government\u201d.\nEMG, a key gas supply company\nsigned a deal with the Israeli Electric\nCompany (IEC) to supply gas to Israel\nfor 15 years, but refused sales of natural gas to a number of private gas consumer companies despite them being\nwilling to pay more. This would mean\nthe IEC would oligopolise the natural\ngas market and supplies to Israel. As\nsuch, a consortium of smaller gas companies have re-opened negotiations\nwith BG as a possible gas supplier for\nIsrael. It has been noted that the relationship between Tony Blair and Israeli\nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert has contributed to the increasingly favourable\ndialogue between Israel and BG.\nTo credit the Daily Mail, as Chomsky himself did on another matter, an\narticle published by David Rose writes\nthat \u201cBlair\u2019s Middle East-focused business career has been a triumph\u201d alongside the statement \u201cNo prime minister\nin modern times would have dreamt of\nexploiting his position in the way Mr\nBlair has done\u201d. His involvement has\nclearly come into controversy.\nThe attitude of the United States, as\nshown through its foreign policy, which\nhas often been described as American\nImperialism, was a major subject of the\ntalk. Chomsky has frequently said that\none reason for discussing and criticising US foreign policy as much as he\ndoes is because he himself is American, and as a result feels he has a degree of responsibility for his country\u2019s\nactions. However, on this occasion the\nfocus was centred on his belief that US\nforeign policy is the only foreign policy\nwhich truly matters, now it is the only\nsuperpower.\nThis was further emphasised by Tariq Ali who said he had been asked to\nmake a few remarks on British foreign\npolicy \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d He provided by far the best quote of the day,\na quote from an ex-UK Ambassador to\nthe US, Sir Antony Maher\u2019s memoirs\nwho had been told by Tony Blair\u2019s chief\nof staff, Jonathan Powell, \u201cYour main\ntask is to find the arsehole of the White\nHouse and remain there.\u201d\nTheir point is that whenever the international community should be getting involved in a situation through the\nUN, the only vote that matters is that\nof the United States. In UN Security\nCouncil meetings, the US is far and\naway the largest user of the Right to\nVeto a decision.\nChomsky made the point that in\nvarious cases at a vote of the UN General Assembly, there had been 4 votes\nagainst the motion, or in effect, 1 vote:\nthat of the US. This is largely because\nthe only one of those countries that\nwill be listened to is the US, and also\nbecause they are all effectively under\nthe control of the US.\nOf course the Nobel Peace Prize has\njust been won by President Obama,\nbut from the very start with the first\nspeaker of the day, Gilbert Achcar,\nthe tone was set by pointing out all\nthe \u2018war-mongering\u2019 people who have\nbeen presented with the award including Theodore Roosevelt (1906) and\nWoodrow Wilson (1919); and of course\nthe Nobel prizes are named after the\ninventor of dynamite. The implication\nwas that the inauguration of the great\nObama will not signal the end of war\nand is unlikely to solve the situation in\nthe Palestine region.\nThe most original point of the night\nwas Professor Chomsky\u2019s assertion,\nmade in passing whilst discussing the\nmerits of a Two-State Solution, that \u201cof\ncourse even better would be a ZeroState Solution.\u201d He capitalised on the\nuniquedifficultiesoftheIsrael-Palestine\nconflict to counter the most frequent\nrebuttal to his anarchist arguments.\nHe repeatedly proclaimed that in this\ncase it would be \u201cno more utopian\u201d than\neither the one or two state solutions\ncurrently on the table. Interestingly, he\nreminded the audience that for most\nof history, for instance under the Ottomans, \u201c[the State] leaving them alone\u201d\nwas precisely the method used to overcome the challenge of sovereignty over\nsuch disparate religious groups.\nThe thrust of this argument is that\nthe logical source of the conflict can\nbe fully explained by the simultaneous\npresence of mutually exclusive statist\nclaims by both Israelis and Palestinians. The argument goes that like all\nStates, they seek geographic monopolies on violence and so cannot possibly\nboth be satisfied. Professor Chomsky\nbelongs to the camp that would favour\nno such monopolies over two, established within the 1948 and 1967 bor-ders, respectively.\nEssentially, this position calls for a\ntransfer of sovereignty to individu-als, such that there is no coercion left\nover whose exact form to fight. Critics would question how such a \u2018free\nstate\u2019 could guarantee its own security\nfrom foreign and domestic threats, run\nan effective legal system or do any of\nProfessor Noam Chomsky lecturing at the event.

Being\na whole 36p cheaper over a 24 month\nplan, Orange isn\u2019t really going to ignite\na price war with O2, instead they\u2019ll\nlikely rely on their better coverage and\n3G bandwidth to win people over. Ok,\nfine, no price war like we all wanted,\nbut I can\u2019t say I\u2019m suprised. What I,\nand a load of the UK tech press were\nsuprised at is the absolute abuse of\nthe word \u2018Unlimited\u2019 by Orange. Unlimited, well you know what it means,\nbut unfortunately Orange obviously\ndoesn\u2019t. Contained within their \u2018fair\u2019\nuse policy there\u2019s a stipulation that\nthe bandwidth cap is actually 750MB.\nI don\u2019t know about you but when I\nbuy an Unlimited plan, I expect to get\nunlimited service, not some meagre\ndownload limit. Now, Orange claim\nthat the average iPhone user doesn\u2019t\nuse more than 200MB a month and\nso 750MB is more than enough. Problem is, I doubt they base that figure on\nactual iPhone usage figures. 200MB\nper month may well be accurate for\nmuch less data-centric devices but\nfor the iPhone, that\u2019s a rather poultry\namount. Considering that the iPhone\nboasts streaming music apps, access to\nYouTube, BBC iPlayer and fully fledged\nweb browsing, even their supposed\nplentiful cap of 750MB is small fry.\nTo make matters worse, a quick\nlook in Orange\u2019s Terms and Conditions shows that they prohibit the use\nof streaming apps such as Spotify and\nsocial networking sites such as Facebook. Now I don\u2019t know about you but\nwhat\u2019s the good of an iPhone that you\ncan\u2019t use the Apps that make it what it\nis? Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I understand that Orange need some sort of\nfair use policy to protect their network\nfrom abuse, but limiting the device by\nblocking what it\u2019s naturally geared up\nto do is ludicrous.\nMore Apple news this week in the\nform of a supposed iPhone 4th generation part leak. China Ontrade, an\nelectronics wholesaler, claims that it\nhas leaked shots of the next-generation\niPhone midboard (the bit that everything screws into inside the phone).\nOk, so it\u2019s not a spy shot, or anything\nthat indicates a radical redesign, and\nit\u2019s literally 8 months early from Apple\u2019s\nusual device generational turn-over.\nBut last time China Ontrade ousted a\nsupposed iPhone part they were dead\non and one month later the iPhone\n3GS appeared. Does this mean that\nApple\u2019s going to break with it\u2019s yearly\nrefresh cycle and release a new iPhone\nmodel in the next few months? With\nmy contract up for renewal in January\nnext year I hope so, but I wouldn\u2019t get\nyour hopes up. Apple\u2019s highly unlikely\nto do such a thing, but never say never.\nTwitter has unleashed lists to the\ngeneral twitter populous this week\nenabling people to set up, maintain\nand follow lists of people and their\ntweets. It gives you the convenience of\nmass follows and means that you can\nfollow people\u2019s tweets without following them directly. If you\u2019re not a twitter user this probably means nothing\nto you, but Lists have become the new\nfollower count with people competing\nto be on as many lists as possible.\nTalking of Twitter, how about a mobile device that does nothing but access and post to Twitter? Well that\u2019s all\nthe TwitterPeek does. For the princely\nsome of $200 without a monthly fee,\nyou can access Twitter from anywhere.\nHmm, I\u2019ll stick with my iPhone thanks.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap Up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAfter the buzz of Android 2.0 last\nweek, this week\u2019s news has been a little more unconventional than most.\nFor starters the Rise of the Machines\nsteadily ploughs on. We\u2019ve got MIT researchers working on a program called\nClearView that will create \u2018immortal\nand invulnerable\u2019 programs. In simple\nterms, it automatically patches programs that experience errors or vul-nerabilities. Great idea to stop hackers\nand viruses from causing havok but\nthink about this: A computer program\nthat can heal itself and can\u2019t be damaged by humans. Skynet anyone?\nLockheed Martin have been in\nthe news this week too with another\ndeathbot. Their next generation UAV\nthe Sabre Warrior Drone, which looks\nlike a cross between something out\nof Batman and Star Wars, is a 46 foot\nlong killing machine. With a wingspan\nof some 36 feet and 22,000 pounds of\nthrust it can handle 2000 pounds of ordinance to destroy any puny building\nyou might be hiding in.\nSkynet can give as well as take away.\nThe latest bomb sniffing robot takes\nthe form of an unmanned helicoptor\ncodenamed Yellow Jacket. This little\nbeauty is tasked with the unenviable\njob of searching out for IEDs and roadside bombs by detecting and locating\ntheir electromagnetic emissions. Travelling by road is currently one of the\nmost dangerous activities in Afghanistan due to the roadside bombs. If Yellow Jacket can give soldiers a scanned\nclear path, then I\u2019m all for it.\nAn autonomous Audi TTS also made\nan appearance this week. Built by Standord to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, a race that takes\nits competitors over 20Km, through\n156 turns and up a 1423m climb on\ngravel and paved roads, the TTS is\npacked full of GPS, sensors and a complicated guidance system. It will be an\nimpressive feet to see the car navigate\nall the twisty turns and reach the finish line and would make Darpa\u2019s Urban\nChallenge look a little like childs play.\nIn entertainment news, the BBC this\nweek announced that it\u2019s iPlayer VOD\nservice is coming to FreeSat starting\nthis month in a closed beta. It\u2019s good\nnews for all those with FreeSat boxes\nand if it\u2019s successful, will probably\nmark a move to integrate the service\nwith FreeView HD boxes later in 2010.\nAll currently available FreeSat+ boxes\nare capable of receiving iPlayer with a\nsoftware update thanks to in-built ethernet ports, which were made mandatory at the beginning of the FreeSat+\nspecification.\nThe Beetles continue their extremely\nlaboured migration to digital distri-bution. Having made it onto Beetles\nRockBand and with re-mastered and\noriginal CDs already available, the Beetles have now made available their 14\nstereo tracks on an Apple shaped USB\nflash drive. The odd looking thing car-Cloud storage is all the rage these\ndays, with connection speeds steadily\nincreasing and online storage ever decreasing in cost. One day it\u2019s likely that\nmost of our data will be stored in the\ncloud in one form or another. We\u2019ve\nbeen accessing our email for decades\nvia webmail interfaces like Hotmail,\nYahoo! mail and Gmail before it was\ndescribed as \u2018the cloud\u2019 and services\nlike Xmarks use server storage for\ncloud based sync. So it shouldn\u2019t come\nas a shock to you that many companies\noffer storage solutions, some better\nthan others, quite a lot for the very student friendly price of free.\nDropbox is one of the better online\nstorage and file sync solutions available at the moment. Its service is built\naround a very simple idea, sync a folder\nfull of files between any computer you\nhappen to use and online.\nThe service itself consists of a client\nthat runs as a service on your compu-ter, syncing any files that are contained\nwithin a \u2018Dropbox\u2019 folder on your\ncomputer. The location of that folder\ncan be user determined but anything\nwithin that folder is automatically\ntransferred to your own personal piece\nof cloud storage provided by Dropbox.\nOnce the file is uploaded it can then\nbe downloaded onto any computer\nwhether it\u2019s a PC, a Mac or even Linux\nthat you set up sync with, seamlessly\nand in the background. If you need access to that file on the road your entire\nDropbox can be accessed via a browser\non the Dropbox website or even via a\nfree iPhone app.\nDropbox\u2019s simple solution essentially\nprovides three services in one. First off\nyou\u2019ve got file sync, which means you\ncan easily transfer files between computers as long as you have an internet\nconnection. You\u2019ve also got access to\nthose files where ever you happen to\nbe via a browser, including your mobile devices, allowing you to keep your\nfiles with you even on other people\u2019s\ncomputers. The third attribute Dropbox provides might be something you\nwouldn\u2019t immediately think about,\nbackup. Dropbox syncs all your files\nin your Dropbox to the cloud meaning you\u2019ve always got a copy of the files\nstored online, but you\u2019ve also got a\ncopy of those files synced to any computer you happen to have set up. In total this means that not only have you\ngot online backup but you\u2019ve got multiple local backups too. So should your\nlaptop get pinched, your house burn\ndown, or an act of god swallows Imperial up in a freak Earthquake, you\u2019ll at\nleast have one or more of those backups available to you.\nDropbox also has one more trick\nup it\u2019s sleeve that sets it apart from\nthe rest of the cloud storage pack and\nthat\u2019s a public folder within your Dropbox. Here you can place files you\u2019d like\nto share with other people and with a\nsimple right click you\u2019ve got a share-able link that you can send to whoever\nyou want to be able to download that\nfile. If they\u2019ve got a Dropbox themselves and their on your local network\nthe software is smart enough to route\nthe file transfer via the local network\nmeaning that you get great connection\nspeeds for anyone who\u2019s local to you.\nDropbox has both free and subscription services. The free service starts off\nat 2GB of storage space, with no nags\nor any other annoyances. Should you\nneed more storage you can buy 50GB\nof storage for $9.99 a month (about \u00a36\nin todays money) or a whole 100GB for\n$19.99 (\u00a312) a month.\nYou can even top up your 2GB of free\nspace to a maximum of 3GB by getting\nyour friends to sign up via referrals in\n250MB chunks.\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a service that\nyou can use from anywhere with an\ninternet connection, to both store and\nsync your files safely and securely, even\nwithin college, then check out Dropbox at www.getdropbox.com and\ngrab some fantastic, free storage that\nsimply works.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor ries copies of the tracks in both FLAC\nand MP3 formats and is equipped with\na custom made Flash player and a load\nof extra video and photo related art-work.

The city\u2019s band\nt-shirt wearing, greasy-locks-flowing metalhead population turned\nout (I had a Mastodon top on) and\nthough KOKO wasn\u2019t sold out, it was\nbustling inside. There were three supports bands: Trigger the Bloodshed,\nAnnotations of an Autopsy and Dying\nFetus. I made sure to get there for the\nlatter because (and please just forget\nthe name) they are one of the most individual extreme metal bands around.\nTheir relentless blasting between\ncatchy choruses had everyone in the\nmood when they finished. I honestly\nthink \u201cPraise the Lord (Opium of the\nMasses)\u201d is the most danceable death\nmetal song on record. Yeah, danceable.\nBut we were there for the Corpse,\nand the Corpse delivered. Everyone\nwho knows them (and if you\u2019ve seen\nAce Ventura, you\u2019ve seen Cannibal\nCorpse) knows what to expect, suffice\nto say it was insane. They\u2019re touring on\na new album (Evisceration Plague) but\nthey played a career-spanning setlist,\ndelving back to their debut for \u201cSkull\nFull of Maggots\u201d while thankfully\ndrawing mostly from classics Tomb of\nthe Mutilated and The Bleeding.\nThe sound was good, but perhaps\nthe staff of the indie-kid nesting site\nKOKO weren\u2019t totally prepared for the\nrelentlessly bass-heavy storm and if\nyou weren\u2019t into moshing (and I\u2019m not)\nyou probably ended up further back\nthan you would have liked. Still, the atmosphere had a pleasant camaraderie,\nand everyone responded to charismatic lead-vocals George \u201cCorpsegrinder\u201d\nFisher\u2019s banter with enthusiasm.\nEventually, curfew came round and\nCannibal Corpse @ KOKO\nGeorge gave his last words. The crowd\npledged their support to death metal\nwith a sea of devil horns and prepared\nfor \u201cHammer Smashed Face\u201d. With\nthe first power chord, the whole room\nturned into a seething mosh pit, and\nI allowed myself a frantic dash to the\nfront to adulate the band. It was an uplifting end to a crushing set.\nI\u2019m not sure Cannibal Corpse are\nthe band to convert new fans to death\nmetal, but there\u2019s a reason they\u2019ve sold\nwell over a million records over twenty\nyears. That night was a true highlight\nfor metal in today\u2019s London.\nLive\nCannibal Corpse\nKOKO\n29th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nI\nan MacKaye has always been\nsomething of a pioneer when it\ncomes to the world of music. First,\nhe formed the definitive \u2013 albeit\nshort-lived \u2013 hardcore punk band Minor Threat in 1980, setting a standard\nfor punk bands the world over with a\nhigh quality production album released\non MacKaye\u2019s own label, Dischord.\nIt\u2019s at that time that he involuntarily\nspawned a movement he described as\n\u201cStraight Edge\u201d; rejecting the \u201csex, drugs\nand rock n\u2019 roll\u201d creed of the punk community and openly admitting to the \u201cuncool\u201d healthy, vegan lifestyle he leads.\nAfter Minor Threat\u2019s break-up in\n1983 due to \u201cmusical differences\u201d,\nMacKaye formed the highly influential\nand critically acclaimed band Fugazi,\ndrawing the name from a Vietnam War\nacronym meaning \u201cFucked Up, Got\nAmbushed, Zipped In\u201d. Though preserving politically charged lyrics and a\nDIY punk ethos, Fugazi expanded their\nmusic in new directions, creating an\nentire sub-genre: post-hardcore.\nWhilst MacKaye was the main songwriter for the first few records, their\nlong-awaited sixth studio album \u201cThe\nArgument\u201d, released in 2001, is the\nwork of four talented musicians at\ntheir creative peak. Aside from multi-Albums that you should know\nple guest vocalists and close friend Jerry Brusher featuring on a second drum\nkit/percussions throughout the album,\n\u201cThe Argument\u201d really stands out due\nto the alchemy between MacKaye\u2019s\nheavy, low-end riffs, Joe Lally\u2019s Latin\nand dub-influenced basslines, and Guy\nPicciotto\u2019s scratchy, high-pitched guitar wails. Not only do the guitars on\nsongs like \u201cEpic Problem\u201d intertwine\nperfectly, but the vocals constantly\ncomplete each other: as MacKaye\nshouts anthemic lead vocals at the top\nof the lungs, forcing the listener to\nshout them back, Picciotto acts as a foil\n(inspired by hip-hop) favouring a more\nGregory Power looks at modern classics that shaped music today\nFugazi\n\u2018The Argument\u2019\nDischord\n2001\n:LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::\nFriday Monday\nTuesday\nLISTINGS::\nAirborne Toxic Event :: Shepherds\nBush Empire :: Rock\nMagnum :: Brixton Academy ::\nRock\nDead Prez :: KOKO Camden ::\nPolitical Hip-Hop\nViking Skull :: The Borderline ::\nHeavy Metal\nENL :: 12 Bar Soho :: Indie Rock\nGoldilocks Effect :: Monto Water\nRats :: Alternative\nPaul Rodgers :: Hammersmith\nApollo :: Blues Rock\nCKY & Special Guests :: Barfly\nCamden :: Rock / Experimental\nPlump DJs :: Fabric :: Electro\nHigh Contrast / Beardyman / Ed\nCymbals Eat Guitars :: Rough Trade\nEast :: Experimental Pop\nJust Jack :: Shepards Bush Empire ::\nDancepop Hip-Hop\nJarvis Cocker :: Village\nUnderground :: Britpop Alternative\nThe Cheek :: Cargo :: Pop\nThe Flaming Lips & Cymbals Eat\nGuitars :: The Troxy :: Rock / Indie\nBackstreet Boys :: O2 Arena ::\nBoyband Homosexual Pop\nAsh :: Corrib Rest :: Pop Rock\nSaturday\nSunday\nBrass Impact :: Tha Half Moon Pub\n:: Big Band Jazz\nBloggers Delight :: The Lock Tavern\n:: Dance / Electro\nHome Grown :: O2 Islington\nAcademy :: American Rock\nAmon Amarth :: KOKO :: Metal\nWednesday\nFionn Regan :: The Luminaire :: Folk\nHundred Reasons :: Barfly :: Rock\nShinedown :: HMV Forum :: Hard\nRock\nColin Hay :: Bush Hall :: Acoustic\nMuse :: O2 Arena :: Rocky Space Rock\nBiffy Clyro :: Brixton Academy ::\nProgressive Rock\nRoots Mauva :: The Hospital (Endell\nStreet) :: Dub / Hip-Hop\nThe Automatic :: New Slang @\nMcClusky\u2019s :: Indie Rock\nCosmo Jarvis :: Notting Hill Arts Club\n:: Indie\nDMZ (Skeam, Loefah, Coki...) ::\nThe Mass :: Heavy Dubstep\nRoger Sanchez :: Ministry of Sound\n:: House\nsubtle, dynamic range of vocals \u2013 illustrated by the \u201cViva viva viva\u201d chorus of\nthe brilliant \u201cLife And Lime\u201d.\nDespite the complex start-stop beats\nand sudden transitions from gentle\nguitar chords to all out noise, this is\nwithout a doubt Fugazi\u2019s most acces-sible, catchy and melodic album. From\nthe simple post-punk riffs and innate\nrambling of \u201cCashout\u201d, all the way to\nthe intricate guitar tapping on \u201cNighthop\u201d, there really is something for everyone here.

With hindsight it could be said booking such a high-profile, expensive band was overly ambitious. However,\nas far as CGCU have been informed, the losses quoted in\nfelix are almost twice as high as the actual figures.\nI feel the article itself was a needlessly personal attack on\nMiss Patterson and appears to have been based on the views\normis-quotes ofonememberoftheCGCUcommittee,sab-batical officers who have not consulted us, or Miss Patterson, who have leaked confidential information to the media,\nwhile being too cowardly to put their names to the quotes\nthey gave.\nMr Steve Long (CGCU Vice President- Activities)\nagreed that last week\u2019s article was a misrepresentation of\nthe views of the majority of the CGCU exec, saying: \u201cThe\nreport of the breakdown of the CGCU committee and dissatisfaction with our President in last week\u2019s felix was way\noff the mark. I wish that more of my comments were included in the article, as this would have suggested the con-trary. For the record, I believe we have the strongest guilds\ncommittee in years. There is a lot of \u201cnew blood\u201d with experience from different areas of college life and this has\nbrought a new lease of life to the CGCU. The proof can\nbe seen in the fantastic turn out to our events, the \u201cImperial Engineers\u201d T-shirts being worn around the campus,\nand the feeling of belonging to the City and Guilds College Union that has been fostered in the last few weeks. I\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank the members\nof CGCU for their hard graft recently to create this environment and to thank our President, Kirsty Patterson.\nGuilds is strong this year, long may it continue!\u201d\nMr Dan Lundy (CGCU Chairman) echoed Mr Long\u2019s\ncomments, saying the ball: \u201cwill serve to encourage fresh-ers and older students to take a more active role within the\nCGCU in the future, it was one of the best IC events I have\nattended to date.\u201d\nWith regards to the comments made by Mr Norris,\nour VPFS, these sentiments are not reflected by the rest\nof the committee. With any group of people there will be\ndisagreements and falling outs, particularly when we are\nstriving to do the best job possible for CGCU, alongside\nstudying for our degree and other commitments. Following discussions all parties have agreed to continue to work\ntogether in a professional manner.\nMiss Patterson disputes Mr Norris\u2019s allegations that\nhe was unhappy with booking New Young Pony Club for\nthe Masquerade Ball. I am unable to substantiate either\u2019s\nclaims, however I would suggest that if there was a disagreement between Mr Norris and Miss Patterson, which\nwas unable to be resolved by the two parties, the rest of\nthe committee, or the DPFS should have been involved. In\nmy opinion, central union Sabbatical Officers should provide more support when such large scale, and high budget,\nevents are being planned.\n\u201cThe CGCU exec did not receive the\nlevel of support promised by central\nUnion sabbatical officers.\u201d\nUpon reading last week\u2019s felix, Mr Weetman (former\nGuildsheetEditor)contactedmetosayhewasmis-quotedin\norder to sensationalise the piece, while reason for resigning\nthe position of Guildsheet editor was ignored. Mr Weetman\nwished to clarify; the pressures of his degree mean he is unable to effectively fulfil the role of editor, but he will remain a\nGuildsheet contributor, albeit in a lesser role.\nThe CGCU exec were happy with the service provided\nby ICU on the evening; we never intended to make a profit\non dinner sales, so any allegations of over-pricing should\nbe directed at central union rather than CGCU.\nPrior to that evening however, the CGCU exec did not\nreceive the level of support promised by central union\nsabbatical officers. ICU President, Ashley Brown, promised in his manifesto to support clubs and faculty unions\nin running events in the union building. In direct con-tradiction, ICU Deputy President, Finance & Services,\nDanny Hill, told CGCU: \u201cCentral Union is not here to help\npublicise Faculty Union events\u201d, when asked to help with\nthe Masquerade Ball.\nAnother major point of Mr Brown\u2019s manifesto was reducing the price of entry to the union, if you just want to go for\na drink. As a member of his campaign team, I was therefore\nextremely surprised to be paying \u00a36 entry to the union on\nthefirstWednesdayoftermandmoreontheFriday.Though\nat the time Mr Brown was confident that, as it was Freshers\u2019Week,\u201cthey\u2019djust payit\u201d, helaterconceded \u201ctheproblem\n[with Faculty Union ticket sales] is that we [Central Union]\nhave bankrupted the freshers with Freshers\u2019 Week.\u201d\nCGCU Welfare Officer Alice Rowlands responds The President\u2019s poem\nMiss Patterson has decided to issue a formal response in the\nform of a poem that she \u201csays things rather more elequently\u201d\nthan her own words.\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\nOr, being lied about, don\u2019t deal in lies,\nOr, being hated, don\u2019t give way to hating,\nAnd yet don\u2019t look too good, nor talk too wise;\nIf you can dream - and not make dreams your master;\nIf you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;\nIf you can meet with triumph and disaster\nAnd treat those two imposters just the same;\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\nOr watch the things you gave your life to broken,\nAnd stoop and build \u2018em up with wornout tools;\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\nExcept the Will which says to them: \u201cHold on\u201d;\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\nOr walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\nWith sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run -Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it,\nAnd - which is more - you\u2019ll be a Man my son!\n\u2018If\u2019 by Rudyard Kipling\n\n"

Supporters are overjoyed that he escaped actual jail time\nbut others in the community aren\u2019t so\npleased. How did the man once titled\nSupreme Scientist find himself narrowly escaping gruel meals, as his case\ntore apart Korean nationalism? And\nwhere do mass human egg donations\nand the Russian mafia fit into it all?\nFour years ago Hwang was a national\nhero, but one of humble origins: born\nduring war into rural poverty, the value of cattle spurred him to enter veterinarian research. His earliest noted\nachievement was the production of\nKorea\u2019s first IVF cow in 1993, followed\nin 1999 by its first cloned cow and in\n2002 by cloned pigs. In 2003, he produced a cow resistant to BSE. Such\naccomplishments garnered him an impressive reputation, with one caveat:\nnot one of them was supported by a\npeer-reviewed journal article.\nBy 2004 he was running a huge and\nintensely driven lab: it\u2019s said that he\ngot into the lab at 6:00am and laboured\nright through until midnight, always\nthe first and last there out of 125 peo-ple. No wonder his marital life was\nstrained. Nonetheless, the publication\nof excellent work seemed inevitable.\nThat year the team released a paper\nin Science that changed the face of\nembryonic stem cell (ESC) research,\npurporting to have created the first\ncloned human embryos using somatic\ncell nuclear transfer (SCNT). SCNT\ninvolves inserting the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell into an empty egg\ncell. It\u2019s notoriously difficult to execute,\nand labs outside Korea failed mainly\nbecause they couldn\u2019t acquire enough\nEliotBarford\nEliotBarford Science Reporter\neggs \u2013 the success rate is tiny. Creating\nDolly the sheep took 277 eggs, while\nHwang claimed success with 242.\nIn 2005, the Hwang lab released a\nsecond groundbreaking paper, this\ntime cloning 11 embryos using just 185\neggs. The community was astounded;\nHwang\u2019s status soared. Two months later\nhe became the first to clone a dog: Snuppy, an (adorable) Afghan Hound. Before\nlong he was raised to the dizzy heights of\nSupreme Scientist and appointed head\nof the World Stem Cell Hub.\nBut even before the second paper,\nquestions had been brewing. A May\n2004 article in Nature first queried\nthe team\u2019s egg sources, catching onto\nwidespread rumours among Korea\u2019s\nyoung researchers. On 11th November\n2005, Gerald Schatten, an American\nco-author on the 2005 paper, informed\nScience that he was no longer collaborating with Hwang, believing he had\nacquired eggs inappropriately. On the\n21st, Sung-Il Roh, a fertility expert who\nsupplied Hwang with eggs, admitted\nsome of them were paid for. The next\nday, a probing TV programme called\nPD Notebook aired a show accusing\nHwang of taking eggs from members\nto retract the paper and validate it im-mediately, stubbornly blaming its errors on his team. SNU quickly rebutted\nhim with its preliminary finding that\nnone of the cell lines were clones of\npatient tissues. PD Notebook\u2019s second\nprogramme was allowed to air and Science officially retracted the paper. In\nJanuary 2006, the SNU investigation\u2019s\nfinal conclusions were announced: neither the 2004 nor 2005 paper was scientifically valid.\nHwang maintained he could clone\nhuman embryos within six months,\nbut never did. Subsequently, a bioeth-ics committee confirmed Hwang\nforced egg donations from his staff \u2013\nin fact he went through 2221 eggs attempting to clone humans, not 427.\nOnly in March 2006 did he finally admit forcing his subordinates to forge\nresults. Until that time he insisted his\ncolleagues must have been to blame.\nSwiftly, his ESC research license was\nrevoked and SNU fired him. In May\nhis arduous trial began, investigating charges of violating bioethics law,\nembezzling 2.8 billion won (US$3 mil-lion) and fraudulently using false data\nto apply for research funding. The case\nhas since dragged on for 40 months\nthrough 60 witness testimonies and 43\njudicial hearings.\nHwang\u2019s embezzlement is perhaps\nmore astounding than his forgeries. He\nlaundered government cash through\nrelative\u2019s bank accounts and spent it on\neggs, donations to politicians and gifts\nfor his wife. Most bizarrely, he actually\ncited dealings with the Russian mafia\nas part of his defence: he had tried to\npurchase mammoth remains on the\nblack market in the hopes of cloning an\nextinct beast. Unable to get receipts for\nthose transactions, he couldn\u2019t prove he\nhadn\u2019t stolen the money.\nHow did Hwang escape the fraud\ncharge after so many lies? The defence\nargued that the companies who funded\nhim weren\u2019t defrauded because they\nhadn\u2019t expected any direct financial\nreward.\nWhat is the result of this sorry story?\nThe effects on scientific process have\nbeen profound, with ethical assessment\nand peer review practices updated and\ntagalong co-authorship like Schatten\u2019s\nlooked upon less fondly. Ironically, an\nSnuppy (right) pictured with the the three-year old donor Afghan whose skin\ncells, taken from the ear, were supposedly used to clone him\nIt is thought the judge was lenient on sentenceing Woo-Suk Hwang (above) to\nallow him a chance to repair his reputation as an outstanding scientist\n$3million (US)\nThe amount Woo-Suk\nHwang is charged with\nembezzling during the course\nof his stem cell research\nindependent group concluded in 2007\nthat Hwang\u2019s fake cloned embryos were\nin fact world-first human parthogenet-ic embryos (those developed from unfertilised eggs), a considerable achievement in itself.\nWho can say what Woo-Suk Hwang\u2019s\nmotivations were? Even his harshest\ncritics agree on his talent, but opinion\nis divided on his nature \u2013 over-keen\nresearcher or devious manipulator. To\nthis day no one has conclusively derived\na cloned human embryo. Some have\nspeculated that the judge was lenient to\nallow him a chance to repair his reputation \u2013 perhaps Woo-Suk Hwang has a\nfew more surprises up his sleeve.\n2221\nThe actual number of eggs\nused in an attempt to\nclone the first human, not\nthe 427 initially calimed\nof his lab, implying he had coerced\nthem. Such practices were illegal under\nnew bioethics law as well as unacceptable internationally.\nSuddenly, two days later Hwang\ncalled a press conference and confessed both to paying for eggs and taking them from members of his group.\nAccordingly, he resigned most of his\npositions, but promised to continue\nresearch.\nYet his fall from grace wasn\u2019t over.\nWord got out that the producers of PD\nNotebook had run tests on Hwang\u2019s\nstem cell lines, showing some were\nnot actually derived from the tissues\nhe claimed they were. Hwang\u2019s considerable support in Korea erupted in\nresponse, organising huge drives for\nwomen to pledge their eggs directly for\nhis research and causing the indefinite\ncancellation of PD Notebook.\nHowever, within days Hwang\u2019s in-stitution, Seoul National University\n(SNU), announced an investigation.\nSchatten requested his name be removed from the 2005 paper. Then,\nwithout warning, Roh declared 9 of the\n11 cell lines to be fabricated. Hwang\ndenied falsifying results but promised\n43 hearings\nThe case has dragged on for\n40 months and gone through\n60 witness testemonies\n\n"

Before being blessed with a Blackberry with internet access, I had them too.\nAnd, as much as a travel extraordinaire/\nfreak I am, I hated them too.\nSo resorting to Britain\u2019s second favourite pastime, I allowed my head to knock\nback and gaze into constellations of \u201cesure.com\u201d and \u201cD*n\u2019t t@ke !t out on our\nstaff\u201d.\nThis scenario fitted neatly with one of\nmy most treasured mottos of travelling:\n\u201cgo in with little to zero expectations,\ncome out with absolute satisfaction.\u201d Despite the mundane contents of most bus\nadvertisements, one particular poster did\ncaptivate a glint of sentimentality.\nThe header simply reads: \u201cBeyond the\ncall of duty in WWI\u201d.\nIt goes on further:\n\u201cWithin 48 hours of the outbreak of\nwar, London buses and their crews began\nmoving troops to and from the war zone.\nIn a few weeks, more than 300 London\nbuses - each with a volunteer driver -were being used at the Western Front in\nFrance and Belgium.\u201d\nThough it served as an advert for the\nLondon Transport Museum in Covent\nGarden, the poster fulfilled its purpose as\na subtle reminder of the unspoken heroes\nof the First World War. The plea went\non to suggest that, as we don our poppies and pipe down for the two-minute\nsilence at 11am this Sunday, we should\nspare a thought on the drivers, the no-less valiant individuals, who played a vital\npart in the British war effort.\nIndeed, with perilous conditions on the\ncontinent inflicted by shell exchange and\nlandmines, their voyages may well have\nbeen their last.\nWhat drives people to travel? Disregard\nthat of leisure travelling \u2012 such isn\u2019t what I\nseek to consider this time round. For this\nparticular editorial I want to explore the\nform of \u2018travel\u2019 that is driven by a sense of\nduty, a sense of moral obligation.\nUnderstandably, many of you live away\nfrom home. I for one have familial duties to meet, albeit having to grudgingly\nendure the 23,000 air miles and on-flight\nscreeching-babies on a yearly basis. But\nwhy on Earth would I put myself through\nTravel at your own risk\nFleur Thomas dissects the atrocity that is India\u2019s traffic system\nI\nf you are a reasonably well off Indian, you will never walk. The distance and the danger of the road\nare immaterial, you will not do so\nout of principle. Even if your destination is only two blocks away, you will\njump onto your scooter, or into your air-conditioned car and drive there. If you\nare foreign and you are walking, you will\nbe asked whether you want a ride on the\nauto at least once every ten metres. Apparently the mere notion of wanting to\nwalk is strange. Why exert yourself if you\ncan avoid it?\nScooters dominate the roads. This is\nbecause any idiot can drive them \u2013 or so\nthey think \u2013 they are small and can worm\ntheir way through the traffic jams. Often\nyou will see the entire family all perched\nprecariously on one scooter. If you get hit\nby a car or a truck when you are on one of\nthose, it is cheaper for the driver to run\nyou over properly and pay the fine than\nfor them to cover your medical expenses.\nOften they will just drive away after they\nhit you, risking neither \u2013 that is precisely\nwhat happened to a friend of mine. The\nwindows of the cars tend to be tinted,\nwhich can mean that they can hardly\nsee you. With cars, the general rule of\nthumb is the bigger the better. Most cars\nbelonging to important civil servants are\nmonster jeeps with little flags poking out\nbehind bars that can and will kill you if\nyou collide with them.\nIfyoudon\u2019thaveacaravailable,youcan\nget an auto. Riding in an auto means that\nyou are sitting at a height that matches\nexactly with that of the exhaust of buses\nand trucks. The auto driver will complain\nabout the traffic every day and will cite\nthis as a reason to rip you off, even though\nthere is traffic every day. They will rip you\noff if you look even remotely foreign. At\npeak times they will refuse to take you,\nbecause they are heading in another di-rection, or because you won\u2019t pay a minimal sum to get home.\nPatience is required \u2013 often when you\nask them to turn on the meter, they will\neither say no outright, or they will claim\nthat it is broken. You will notice huge\nvariations in meter rates in different au-tos, which can lead one to speculate as to\nhow this is possible. Otherwise you fix\na price and they take you. Once you are\nthere and you have no change, they might\nsay that they don\u2019t have change either.\nThey are usually lying and simply want\nyour note. If they are particularly rude,\nthey will take your note and you have to\nstand in front of the auto to stop them\nfrom driving away. If they are not lying,\nthey will ask around for you.\nIt is important to ask the auto driver\nwhether he knows where he is going,\nbecause otherwise he might get lost. In\nfact, it is better if you know how to get\nthere as, otherwise, they might drive in\ncircles and charge you by the kilometre.\nIf you picked a particularly macho driver,\nhe may blame you for getting lost \u2013 even\nthough he said he knew how to get there\n\u2013 and then get aggressive.\nIt is best to pick an older driver, as he is\nstill alive having driven for twenty years.\nHe is likely to know where he is going and\nhe is less laden with testosterone.\nThe drive will invariably involve\nclose encounters, slaloming and sudden\nbrakes; but as with all things there are\nexceptions. Mine was when there was a\nlot of traffic and I found myself in an auto\nstuck between a huge truck carrying petrol and another auto with gas canisters \u2013\nI thought I was going to die. Sometimes\nthey drive right behind trucks that are\ncarrying \u2013 and often leaking \u2013 some kind\nof transparent fluid. You would hope it is\nwater, but often it isn\u2019t. Often when they\ndrop you somewhere, they will do a quick\nU-turn and drop you off on the other side\nof the road. This involves driving several\nhundred metres in the wrong lane, while\nthe traffic policeman \u2013 who is too busy\nlooking pretty \u2013 overlook.\nBuses are taken by those who find autos too expensive. There are two doors \u2013\nthe front one for ladies, the back for men.\nThe ladies are given more seats but it is\nstill very crowded and you will most likely\nbe standing. Sometimes men will use the\nfront door when they are in a hurry, but\nthey will usually move to the back. Occasionally they will stay to harass women.\nThey generally squeeze at least one extra\nperson onto the bench, so you become intimately acquainted with several people\nall at once. The doors of the bus are always open, even while driving and when\nit is completely full, people are pouring\nout of the doors. People are to the bus as\nexcess fat is to over-tight trousers.\nBefore coming to India, I had never\nseen the phrase \u2018catching a bus\u2019 taken so\nliterally. Although the buses go ever so\nslowly and the engine really does complain about the slightest slope, they cannot be easily stopped. My friend mentioned this guy who was trying to cross\nthe road and found himself in front of a\nbus that couldn\u2019t stop. He then had no\nchoice other than to lie flat on the road to\navoid being killed.\nthe torment \u2012 and guilt on my colossal\ncarbon footprint \u2012 when I can simply\nstay in London? Perhaps the motivation\nlies with my obligation \u2012 and sometimes\ngenuine wish \u2012 to see my parents.\nThis is the darker side of the travelling world, which we all have a fair share\nof. This is the mode of travel that leaves\nus entrapped in a bleak timeframe, feet\nfixed on the ground or bottom on the\nseat, minus the glamour and anticipation\nof the abnormality we experience when\nwe go on holiday.\nI suspect this is why we, as a society,\ntend to avoid the word \u2018travel\u2019 when depicting our laborious endeavour to reach\na destination that lacks a ski slope or the\nodd palm tree. Similarly, my loyal felix\nreaders, this is why whereupon finding\nthe travel section you expect to find anecdotes of \u2018travels\u2019 based in exotic, far-far-away locations.\nAs much as we wish to shun it, travelling is inevitably incorporated into our\nnormal day lives. It is human to travel.\nWhether it is the duty to oneself to \u2018travel\u2019\nto the local groceries, the duty to \u2018travel\u2019\nto college to attend lectures, or obligation to mates to \u2018travel\u2019 to attend a farewell party, obligation to parents to \u2018travel\u2019\nhome, or even obligation to Dan Wan to\n\u2018travel\u2019 to Beit in order to complete laying\n-out the travel page, the message is syn-onymous: despite our efforts to beautify\n\u2018travel\u2019, it is not entirely a luxury.\nHowever do not regard it with shame.\nBecause, as with the examples above, by\ntravelling our satisfaction with the result,\nand the smile that blossoms from the\nlips of friends and parents \u2012 and possibly\nour revered Editor-in-chief if I am lucky\n\u2012 from sheer happiness outweighs the la-bour. Even the process itself, though not\nentirely enjoyable, can have us brimming\nwith pride.\nJust like those bus drivers in WWI who\nhad their courage awarded by an array of\nmedals, and their loved ones who only\nhad memories to cling onto in the aftermath of the war.\nAnd so I urge you, proud fellow British\ncitizens, to don your poppies and conduct your two-minute silence on Sunday,\nNovember 8th\n, and spare a thought for the\nservicemen who themselves \u2018travelled\u2019 to\nan uncertain, yet glorious, fate.\nYou can complain to any of the following officers, but they\u2019ll be much happier\nto just take your bribe\nNext station,\na spot for\nremembrance\n\n"

We went back to mine and\nwithout any encouragement she undressed and said sternly \u201clets just do\nit\u201d\n. I could hardly believe my luck\nand gleefully fell into bed.\nShe decided to go all deep throat\nand again I was feeling pretty happy,\nuntil she literally started to gag and\nchoke.

I immediately sent her on her way and have\nsince had a lot of trouble with hunger and sexual arousal.\nWhat can I do?\nMaximus Lupus\nDear Max,\nI would avoid eating spaghetti for a\ngood while. Maybe you should try to get\nover your trauma by trying expressing\nit in art.

I was trying to impress her by\nlifting some hefty weights, when the\nold man in front of me bent down\nand farted in my mouth. It literally\ntasted of macaroni cheese and I had\nto stop myself from retching.\nThe girl however seemed to read this\nsuppressed retch face as guilty and\nhas since not so much as smiled in\nmy direction.

I\nseem to get drunk and then completely forget that I shouldn\u2019t drink\nit. It gives me complete impotence\nand is obviously pretty embarrass-ing. What excuse can I give for not\ndrinking it? I hate my life.\nRegards,\nSpencer\nHi Spencer,\nDrinking too much alcohol can affect\nyour ability to get and maintain an\nerection (often called \u2018brewer\u2019s droop\u2019).\nIn the longer term, it interferes with the\nproduction of testosterone, which can\nreduce your libido.\nI suggest you watch your drinking in\ngeneral and maybe try to particularly\navoid spirits such as Sambuca.\nYou could just blame it on an intolerance or allergy. If the problem doesn\u2019t\ngo away you should consider going to\nsee the GP.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nUsually spaghetti\u2019s quite an appealing prospect after a night out, but not when it\u2019s spewing out your girlfriend\u2019s mouth and onto your pubes\nWhen?

Well the obvious answer to all of our financial problems is to start an empire. However,\nthis is not as easy as it sounds!\nBefore you hop on a plane and start\ncolonising China, you have to remember that it has sort of already been col-onised. Stealing a country is a fine art\nand Hangman is here to give you the\nbasics to global domination\nSTEP 1 - Before you run off on your\nraping and plundering escapade, you\nneed permission from the Queen. Send\nher a quick wall post on facebook, e.g\n\u2018Heyyy Lizbo! Howz u? jst wndering\nif u wer up 4 invadin France nxt week\nLOL! wb xox\u2019\nIf you receive a reply, she will probably\nask you to make a formal presentation\nto a Dragon\u2019s Den style panel consisting of Helen Mirren, David Attenborough and Pat Sharp from Fun House. If\nPat gives you the executive nod - you\u2019re\naway!\nSo you\u2019re cool, you\u2019re politically correct...why not take over the world? It\u2019s the next logical step\nAnonymous\nAnonymous Hangman Editor\nBeginner\u2019s Guide to Starting an Empire\nSTEP 2 - You need a boat. None of this\nmodern, metal \u2018Ooh look at me I\u2019m so\nshiny\u2019 shit! You need a good old-fash-ioned fuck-off Galleon! Arm it with\nfuck-off cannons, fuck-off sails and a\ntiny little fuck-off crow\u2019s nest!\nGive it an intimidating name, such as\n\u2018Uber Pwnage\u2019, \u2018Harold Shipman\u2019 or\n\u2018Clive\u2019. We\u2019ve overlooked the British\ntradition here of naming them after\nour beloved wenches. That\u2019s because\nthe only female name that you don\u2019t\nwant storming towards you is the SS\nBeth Ditto and that\u2019s sadly already\nbeen taken.\nSTEP 3 - Get a parrot and a ruff - Ruffs\nare fucking amazing! Admittedly not\nvery piratey, but you\u2019re a pirate with\nclass. A classy pirate with a fuck-off\nruff! That\u2019s right you\u2019re a fucking pirate\nwith a fuck-off ruff!\nSTEP 4 - Round up your crew. Lace\nup your boots and kick down the door\nof your local tavern. Make sure you\u2019re\nwearing your ruff at this point. The\ncommon landlubbers will see your\nfuck-off ruff and drool all over the\nfloor. They should sign up in a matter\nof picoseconds.\nSTEP 5- You now have a crew and a\nGalleon called Clive. The next step,\npossibly the most important step, is\nto ensure the safety of your ruff. Only\nyou, the Captain, are allowed to wear a\nruff and this may put strain on vessel-relationships. If tension rises and you\nfear a mutiny, allow them to stroke or\ncaress your ruff for a very short period\nof time, under strict supervision. Make\nsure they wear ruff-friendly gloves.\nYou may want to buy a safe for your\nruff.\nSTEP 6 - Invade France. This is like\na tutorial skirmish on any standard\nreal-time strategy game. Consider this\nHangman\nHangman\nunion.ic.ac.uk/acc/football\nDISCLAIMER\na training exercise for your crew. It\nshould be a short battle, with no casualties on your side.

This is the official procedure for claiming France as\nyour own, as legislated in the Penguin\n\u2018Pirates handbook 2009\u2019. Congratulations, you now own France. Although\nit may seem exciting to have successfully captured a country, remember\nthat France is just the shit-stain on the\ngreat white underpants that is Europe!\nSTEP 7 - Find India. You\u2019ve heard\nabout it, but you don\u2019t really know\nwhere it is. The best methodical approach is to sail arbitrarily in any direction and to name the first place you\nland at as India.\nRemember, it won\u2019t be as easy as\nFrance!

Them Indians\nwon\u2019t know what\u2019s hit them!\nSTEP 8 - The Slave Trade - Being a\nleader isn\u2019t easy. You should, by now,\nhave control of a great many countries\nand their people.

I didn\u2019t go\nlast year, but I was given a tour\nby felix stalwart and sexy gentleman Tomo Roberts; stalking members of the games industry, mistaking\nevery game in the exhibition for Mass\nEffect 2, and generally breaking everything we touched. What did we get\nour hands on? Well, lots of things, but\nI honestly couldn\u2019t tell you anything\nmore from the three or four minutes I\ngot with each that you wouldn\u2019t be able\nto garner from YouTube. Mass Effect\n2 - very similar to Mass Effect 1. Left4Dead2 - pretty fun, I guess. Dragon\nAge - bewildering, but Mr. Roberts\nspent half an hour glued to it so I can\nonly assume that\u2019s good too.\nThis is the problem with exhibitions like this \u2013 they don\u2019t tell you an\nawful lot. That\u2019s why they frequently\nbecome more about the periphery,\nabout seeing all the other stuff around\nit. Valve\u2019s Chet Faliszek was around\nthe Left4Dead2 stand chatting to gam-ers. People from nVidia were trying\nto convince gamers to spend \u00a3350 on\nmaking their monitors wobble a bit in\n3D, and of course the Developer Sessions, where developers talked about\ntheir games. Among the high-profile\ntalks that your fearless correspondent\nmissed entirely included Splash Damage, who demonstrated their new FPS\nBrink, and nVidia who were further\ntrying to impress people with silly\nglasses and layered Batmen.\nHowever, I did manage to claw back\nsome journalistic respectability by attending David Cage\u2019s talk on Heavy\nRain, his new game coming to the PS3\nsoon. It\u2019s supposed to genuinely tell a\nstory, in much the same way that his\nearlier work Fahrenheit aimed to. He\nwas very frank in admitting mistakes\nhe had made in Fahrenheit (\u201cI need to\nmake the story last for more than two\nthirds of the game...\u201d) but also adamant\nthat it was an important stepping stone\nin his path to narrative-driven gaming.\nHe\u2019s an enormously interesting man,\nand Heavy Rain is a fascinating game.\nIt\u2019s quite clear from the short demo he\ngave that it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to\nbe \u2013 the complex, looping gameplay\nshowed an audio repeat or two, and\nit\u2019s not like you can do whatever you\nwant. But he also made some great\npoints. When asked whether he was\ntrying to encourage people to play the\ngame many times to see everything,\nhe replied, \u201cActually, I\u2019d kinda like it if\nthey played the game just once. Because\nlife\u2019s a bit like that, you don\u2019t get to see\neverything.\u201d\nCage later defended his attempt to convey love, sadness and depression through\nhis games, saying that Hollywood was not\nall action and comedy movies.\nIt\u2019s exciting stuff. If only I had a PlayStation 3. Look out for Heavy Rain when it\ncomes out next year, and enjoy this issue.\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nMichaelCook\nTen Long Years - 2003\nW\now. So we lost half\nour column space,\nhuh? I guess news\nis more important\nor some bullshit.\nAnyway, let\u2019s not dwell and instead\nmove swiftly on through the decade.\n2003! Games! Andrew, quickly, tell us\nabout Knights of the Old Republic!\n\u201cLoved this game. Still do. Very accessible RPG, and I think the first one\nI really got into (all those AD&D ones\npassed me by, shamefully). The fact\nthat it was all fully voiced (though\nwith a bit of a cheat due to the sheer\nnumber of aliens in the game) layered\nthe polish on to a very solid game with\nan intriguing storyline.\u201d\nHmm. Okay. That sounded pretty\nsane though, anyone want to go a bit\ncrazy for me? Hent?\n\u201cThe first Bioware game that didn\u2019t\nactively penalise you for being evil, so\nnaturally I was all over that. It started out\nkind of limp with petty extortion and the\nlike, but soon ramped up to slave trading\nand dicing an insane guy into kibbles as\nhe hid inside a storage locker\u201d\nExcellent. This was a pretty good year\nall-round for being evil, what\nwith Republic and Deus\nEx: Invisible War being\nreleased. Although both\nweren\u2019t treated with such\nhigh regard as KotOR:\n\u201cInvisible War is a bad\ngame because it\u2019s central\npremise \u2013 the idea of\nproviding the player\nwith a choice of how\nto complete an ob-Thespaceissmaller,butthegamesarestillgood.Nextyear,hooo!\njective \u2013 is woefully implemented. No\nmatter how much you piss off any of the\nfactions, they will still come back cap in\nhand asking you to kindly go and murder someone or blow up something or\nsteal something-or-other. So you never\nfeel like you\u2019re fighting for one particular faction or like you\u2019re part of a particular cause or ideology, you just feel like\nan uninterested freelancer. This and the\nstory was bollocks.\u201d\nAway from the shop shelves, big things\nhappened. Valve released Steam, the\nsuccessor to their WON service, now the\nbehemoth digital distribution service on\nthe PC platform.\nSoul Calibur 2 hit many platforms this\nyear, an important game in the beat \u2018em\nup genre, providing a contrast to the\nTekken-alikes that were becoming more\nand more popular.\n\u201cSC2 was the only beat \u2018em up I ever\nplayedthatfeltsatisfy-ing to master. The\nfighting styles it\noffered blended in the way\nthat they should, animated themselves in\na way that made sense visually. It made\nyou feel powerful.\u201d\nThe Gamecube also picked up another\nlandmark this year, with Wind Waker\u2019s\nrelease finally bringing Zelda into the\nlatest console generation. The new visual\nstyle was stunning, even if the departure\nfrom Ocarina was difficult for some\nplayers to accept.\n\u201cWind Waker wasn\u2019t a game that immediately grabbed you. It took some\ntime to get into, it didn\u2019t fire up enthusiasm from the start. But it was still a\nfantastic game. The music, the feeling of\nopen space, was unlike anything GC had\nseen before.\u201d\nIt was a good year for sequels, too,\nwith Homeworld 2, Jak 2 and Max Payne\n2 all making their way to gamers in the\nsecond half of the year. But the real gem\nlurking in the list of Christmas releases is\nthe unassuming Beyond Good And Evil,\nthe journalistic platformer that everyone\nkeeps meaning to play.\n\u201cBG&E was such a gorgeous game.\nEvery bit of that world was just right,\nand all the gameplay tricks just added\nmore and more to the characteri-sation \u2013 photographing animals for biological\ncatalogues, inventing stuff for Pey\u2019j to\nuse. It was all amaz-ing, and it\u2019s a shame it\nprobably won\u2019t see a\nsequel.\nNext year - Half-Life\n2, World of Warcraft\nand Rome: Total War.\nEnough said.\nIn Pictures - The Week In News: Valve like reader tabasco, Fallout MMO and more\nSaxton Hale Responds\nReaders of the Team Fortress 2 website who responded to a fake product\ncatalogue received especially-created comics from Valve as a reward.\nFallout MMO\nLegal proceedings have forced Interplay to release concept art for their\nFallout MMO in order to prove it is\nin production.\nPapercraft Mode\n3D modeller Eric Testroete creates\ncopy of his head in paper, only larger,\nfor game-style Big Head Mode.\nIGF 2010 Opens\nThe list of entries to the 2010 Independent Games Festival has been\nannounced.\n\n"

    "content": "14 felix FRIDAY 06 NOVEMBER 2009\nInterfaithing across Imperial College\nfelix meets some members of the new Imperial College Interfaith team to find out what this new movement is\nall about! We talk about why this society will soon play such a prominent part of university life\nFelix: Hi guys, nice to meet you all. I understand this is a new initiative and that\nyour first event is called UniFaith: Road\nto Dialogue. What does UniFaith mean?\nAndrew: Hi Felix! Well, when we came\ntogether to decide a name for the launch\nevent, we were struggling to find a short,\npunchy and diverse title that encompasses the depth of our initiative. But our\nsearching was satisfied once we came up\nwith UniFaith. The \u201cUni-\u201c denotes the\nUNIfying aim of our initiative \u2013 to unite\nall faiths behind common aims they en-dorse, but which faithful individuals may\nforget to exercise.\nYousuf: These common aims are morality and humanity \u2013 the betterment of\nsociety. Of course the \u201cUni-\u201c suffix can\nalso represent university and universal,\nmanifesting the student, and all-encom-passing nature of Imperial Interfaith.\nFelix: But there are already so many\nfaith societies at Imperial College, why is\nit that you have created an interfaith so-ciety? Surely faith societies can co-exist\nalready?\nYousuf: You\u2019re right, of course; faith societies can and do co-exist. But whilst the\nunion faith societies have a crucial role in\ntaking up the influx of freshers and cultivating their religious identity and beliefs,\nwe as faithful individuals may sometimes\nlose sight of the bigger picture and forget\nthat there are people of other faiths in\nthis world too! Sometimes, we see people passing through university, wonderfully engrossed in their faithful practices,\nyet completely failing to interact with\nother faiths around them. This can be a\nvery sad situation, because you end up\nlosing out on dialogue \u2013 one of the most\nfruitful opportunities of university life.\nMay: By having an interfaith forum at\nImperial, we can ensure that there is\nmuch interaction, and of the appropriate\nand respectable nature, between different faith groups on campus... People may\nask why but the answer\u2019s simple: so that\nwe can finish our journey in university as\nlearned and open-minded ambassadors\nof the world, whilst maintaining our respective identities.\nAndrew: In fact, to their credit, the newly formed interfaith committee consists\nof individual representatives from each\nfaith society. This way, all faiths are adequately represented on the committee,\ngiving each faith society an equal taste of\nthe interfaith experience.\nFelix: Interfaith dialogue can be seen to\nbe a confusing thing. Many times people\nare afraid of being converted, being challenged about their beliefs or of interfaith\nattempting to create a new religion alto-gether. How will Imperial College interfaith combat these misconceptions?\nAndrew: This movement is nothing to\ndo with conversion or challenging each\nother or creating any form of new reli-gion! It\u2019s about the unification of society,\nabout learning to understand and accept other beliefs and practices \u2013 using\ndialogue and discussion as the means to\nachieve this.\nYousuf: The variety of backgrounds at\nuniversity should not allow us to lose\nthe identity of our faiths and principles.\nTherefore, the first aim of interfaith is\nthe acknowledgment of the different\nfaiths, and the respect for individuals\nthat have made a choice in life to believe\nhow the world works in a certain way.\nObjective and polite discussion, which is\nthe modus operandus at our events, can\nalways prevent faithful people from losing their identity.\nMay: I would go so far as to say interfaith\nstrengthens one\u2019s own beliefs! Learning\nabout the similarities and differences\nbetween yours and other faiths actually\nplays a role in reinforcing your own be-liefs, simply because you increase your\nunderstanding of why you believe in\nwhat you believe. And of course, through\ngaining closeness to God\u2019s creation, your\nbrothers and sisters in humanity, you increase your closeness for their creator.\nFelix: In light of the recent fiasco with\nthe BNP\u2019s appearance on Question\nTime, how do you think your initiative\nfits in with the model of Britain today?\nAndrew: I like to think that university is\na microcosmic representation of the rest\nof the world. And the way we organise\nthings at university, is the way would like\nto shape the world and how we fit into it.\nQuite clearly, the ICI sets out to include\npeople of all backgrounds in a diverse\nBritain by respecting their identities, recognising the ability for living together in\npeace, whilst still being able to encounter\nobjective discussion.\nYousuf: We believe that diversity is a\ndriving force for unity. It\u2019s a little daft to\nsuggest that the inhabitants of an area\ncan only be of one particular race or\none particular background, and to base\none\u2019s sole principle upon this ludicrous\nnotion. 150 years ago, it was rare to see\npeople from different 8 faiths living to-gether. But now whilst it is a reality, we\nhope to make the most of it and reap\nonly benefits from its existence.\nFelix: So what are the main goals of the\ninitiative?\nAndrew: There are a number of goals\nwe aim to achieve through this forum.\nOne goal is to facilitate unity between\nthe faiths on campus behind common\naims and objectives where possible.\nThis mainly arises from recognizing the\nsimilar traits and principles between all\nfaiths, and as a result making a bigger\nimpact on the campus, and eventually\nthe world, to create a positive change towards a greater good.\nYousuf: Another important aim is to\nencourage dialogue and further the\nknowledge of each other about different\nfaiths. This enables us to understand and\naccept differences, as well as highlight\nsimilarities. It\u2019ll help us to understand\nwhy other faiths practice and behave the\nway they do, and will give scope for us\nto agree to disagree in an objective and\nethical manner. Of course in some cases\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll learn that our beliefs are in\nfact in harmony.\nMay: The launch event especially will\ngive people the opportunity to learn the\ndetails of different faiths from the practitioners of that faith, or from the \u201chorse\u2019s\nmouth\u201d\n, rather than from other unreliable sources. In fact, active dialogue with\nthe members of a certain faith will only\nserve to remove any possible misconceptions and potential source of prejudice.\nFelix: Sometimes within a discussion,\nwe find we don\u2019t always have the answers\nto certain issues, either due to lack of\nknowledge or insight. Will this be problematic in interfaith discussion?\nYousuf: Without an initiative like Imperial Interfaith, it can potentially, yes,\nbecause people may get confused or\nemotional, and the discussion may turn\ninto something quite ugly. But our group\nfacilitates appropriate \u201cethics of discussion\u201d so that nobody is at fault to say\n\u201cactually, I don\u2019t have an answer to that\nquestion\u201d or \u201cI would need to read up\nmore to get back to you on that one.\u201d\nAndrew: Yousuf\u2019s right \u2013 in fact some-times, the conclusion of a discussion\nmay be that it is inconclusive... But by no\nmeans does it mean that it was done in\nvain! In contrast, we often find that the\npathway of the discussion and the development of thought and understanding is\nan invaluable gift to walk away with.\nFelix: What other events do Imperial\nCollege Interfaith have planned?\nYousuf: Well, there are a few things in\nthe pipeline. A long term aim still\nremains to be combining the\ntalents of this university\u2019s faith\nsocieties in an Interfaith Charity Week. I mean, imagine the\namount of money we could\nraise if we could utilise the collective talents of the students responsible for say East Meets West,\nMega Malai, ISoc Charity Week to\nname but a few\u2026 All of these endeavours have raised hundreds of\nthousands of pounds for charity and\nall have spawned from different faiths\nsocieties \u2013 imagine what would happen\nInterfaith Co-ordinator \u2013\nMohammedabbas Khaki\nIt has long been a dream of mine\nto find a platform whereby\nour community can be united;\nwhere we can celebrate our\nsimilarities, understand and\naccept our differences, and\nunite under the common bond\nof humanity.\nInterfaith Co-ordinator \u2013\nYousuf Salmasi\nI\u2019ve spent my years at Imperial\ninvolved in faith and cultural\nsocieties. I think that our quest\nbecomes far more fruitful\nand accelerated once we\nacknowledge diversity and\ninteract with those from so\nmany other belief backgrounds.\nAhlul Bayt Society Sara Maki\nBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Society Jean-philippe Aoussou\nBuddhist Society Bryan Chia\nCatholic Society Nicholas Church\nChristian Union Nathan Sherwood\nEvery Nation Christian Society Jonathon Wright\nHindu Society Harsita Patel\nIslamic Society Obadah Ghannam\nJain Society Amar Shah:\n\u2018Live and let Live\u2019 (Mahavir Swami)\nJewish Society Yoni Weiner\nSikh Society Govindpal Singh Kooner\nif we pooled all of these talents? The fundraising for charity could be incredible\u2026\nAnd think about what a message it sends\nout \u2013 a united community, working to-gether, for the benefit of their brothers\nand sisters in humanity!\nAndrew: Of course, in the near future\nwe have events too\u2026 They may include\na dialogue in the incredible location of\nthe Bedouin tent pitched outside at St\nEthelberga\u2019s Centre for Reconciliation in\nthe City, interfaith sports tournaments,\nvisits to other local places of worship,\nand a sacred object tour of the V&A museum in South Kensington.\nMay: Other exciting events include dialogues on more controversial topics like\ngender role, and events where members\ncan discuss and share articles of faith\nsuch as different scriptures.\nFelix: Finally, what about people of\nno faith? Are they still included in this\ninitiative?\nAndrew: Of course. In fact, it is perfect\nfor a person with no faith. ICI provides\na great opportunity to learn about any\nfaith for the first time, from first hand\nsources and in as much depth as you\nwant \u2013 without feeling pressurised into\nbelieving in any of them!\n\n"

The President, Angela, Treasurer, Rhodri and\nSecretary, Max, have worked hard to\nbring together a packed year of events\nfor those interested in a career in Law.\nTheir dedicated work will ensure you\nget the up-to-date information about\nLaw. Even though Imperial does not\noffer a course in Law, the Society will\nI\nwould have to say that my prevailing memory of Choir, Sinfonietta Orchestra and Big\nBand\u2019s summer tour is of Currywurst. Never before have 130\nof the finest musical folk Imperial has\nto offer consumed so much sausage,\nketchup and curry powder. Of course,\nour week-long tour to Berlin this September was not made up exclusively of\nlazing around stuffing our faces \u2013 oh\nno! We succeeded in squeezing seven\nfantastic performances into our busy\nschedule.\nPast and current students and staff\nconverged in the BaxPax hostel in central Berlin on Tuesday, 15th September,\nwaiting expectantly to see what the trip\nmight throw their way. Being in such\nvast quantity (and such high spirits),\nwe wasted no time in making the hostel our own, pitying the other guests\nand making good use of the bar. Despite the 1 Euro fine for late attendance\nat the 09:00 rehearsal the next morning\nthere were a good few squinting Sinfonietta members making their way out\nof the door at 09:30 on the Wednesday.\nWhile the Choir and Big Band slept in,\nthe Orchestra set to work perfecting\nHumperdinck\u2019s \u201cHansel and Gretel,\u201d\nSibelius\u2019 2nd Symphony, Tchaikovsky\u2019s\n6th Symphony and Delius\u2019 \u201cNorwegian\nSongs\u201d in one of the Humbolt University\u2019s buildings. A few hours later,\nit was all change; Sinfonietta was free\nto explore one of the most diverse cities in Europe and the Choir took to\npracticing their mix of Faur\u00e9, Handel,\nHowell, Rutter and Parry with gusto.\nBig Band took up the last slot of the day\nin our rehearsal venue and blasted out\nsome exasperatingly catchy jazz hits to\nthe German students milling around\nthe courtyard. That evening, the majority of the tourists found themselves\nin an Oktoberfest bar somewhere\nalong Oranienburger Strasse, Berlin\u2019s\ncentral red-light boulevard, trying desperately to avoid catching the eye of\nany of the prostitutes. Those big boys\nand girls who made it to twelve o\u2019clock\nwere rewarded with a visit to an artist\u2019s\nsquat in the bombed-out department\nstore, bristling with graffiti, behind the\nhostel.\nAs a city, Berlin has everything a\nlarge group of students might need\nto entertain themselves for a week.\nWe dutifully took our dose of culture,\nclimbing the Reichstag and joining\nthe free walking tour, only to discover\nto our delight that Germany is actually fascinating! One bright morning,\nsome very dedicated culture addicts\nmade the hour-long trek to find the\ncelebrated East Side Gallery. Upon\narriving at their destination and being unable to locate said gallery, they\nwere informed that the vast stretch of\npainstakingly decorated remnants of\nthe Berlin Wall that they had passed\nwas, in fact, it. Other excursions were\nmore successful; Berlin\u2019s zoo boasts the\nlargest number of species of any zoo in\nthe world and the street markets, the\nlargest variety of tat.\nThe Thursday evening was the first\nof our string of gigs. Big Band played\ntwo sets in the Pfefferberg Sommergarten to uproarious applause and\nsome interesting limb-flailing loosely\nbased on dancing. It emerged that\ntwo of our number had been masking Latin-dance prowess sufficient to\ncause the rest of us to wonder what we\nhad done to deserve multiple left feet.\nBig Band produced some unbelievable solos throughout their classic set\nof Jazz, Funk and Latin from the likes\nof Buddy Rich, Gordon Goodwin and\nFrank Sinatra. Of course, as we can\nalways expect from our Jazz pros, it\nwas all flawless but I think they just\nmight have outdone themselves with\ntheir jaw-dropping arrangement of Pat\nMetheny\u2019s \u201cThe First Circle.\u201d\nThe next evening, it was the Orchestra\u2019s turn to impress. The venue\nwas the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial\nChurch, affectionately known to the\npublic as \u201cthe lipstick and the powderpuff,\u201d owing to its freakish cosmetic\nexterior \u2013 the sort of architecture that\nwould make your great aunt swab her\nbrow with a hanky. The waffled, blue\nglass, octagonal church-cum-concert\nhall provided a remarkable venue for\nsome equally remarkable playing. Getting an audience in Berlin is always a\nchallenge, particularly when the Berlin Philharmonic is playing the same\nevening, but with a concerted effort\nto hand out all 600 flyers the auditorium was packed. The high calibre\nperforming continued well into the\nearly morning with an illuminating\nkaraoke session back in the hostel. It\nwas discovered that John Lennon had\nsomehow infiltrated our group when\nhe took the stage and made everyone\ncry with his beautiful singing.\nSinfonietta\u2019s second concert was the\nfollowing day. All of a sudden, bellowing \u201cwhen I think about you, I touch\nmyself,\u201d the night before didn\u2019t seem\nlike such a good idea for our singing\nsoloist. Nevertheless, the show did go\non. The Marienkirche was lined with\nscaffolding, the audience sat facing the\nwalls and there were a few last minute\nglitches in the lower wind section but\nSinfonietta\u2019s second and final concert\nproved to be one of the best yet. Needless to say, the bar lucky enough to\nreceive our business post-concert saw\nits entire spirits store run dry. A sickening number of sectional shots were\nordered, showcasing the phenomenal\nendurance of the musicians\u2019 livers.\nSunday was witness to the return\nof Big Band. Twice. Throughout the\nentire week, two worryingly-talented\nstring players had been abstaining,\nmummifying themselves with tubi-grip and carb-loading in preparation\nfor the Berlin Marathon. Give the\nbiggest of hands to Eluned Smith and\nEugene Chang who both completed\nthe 42 (and a bit) kilometres on that\nparticularly hot Sunday morning. Extra points go to Eugene for being sufficiently deranged to have completed the\ncourse the day before, on roller blades.\nBig Band had a spot at the 40km mark\nand heralded 40,000 runners with\near-popping jazz whilst the spectators were soon exhausted from all the\nclapping and whistling in the scorching German sun. Simultaneously, the\nChoir and a select group of strings\nwere putting the finishing touches to\ntheir concert programme in the Auenkirche that evening. At five o\u2019clock the\nrest of the group, and some very fortunate Berliners, listened to Handel\u2019s\nLet Thy Hand Be Strengthened and\nother stunning pieces in absolute rap-ture. After a few hours break, Big Band\nwarmed up again. This time the venue\nwas an underground jazz club north of\nthe hostel called Kunstfabrik Schlot.\nNaturally, none of us found the name\nremotely amusing.\nAll too soon our little jaunt had\ncome to an end. The final day saw the\nchoir perform their second concert,\nthis time in the beautiful Zionskirche,\nfollowed by the end-of-tour meal in\na nearby microbrewery. Prizes were\npresented to those whose contribution to the tour had been particularly\nnoted. Tears were shed for those who\nwouldn\u2019t be returning to Imperial\nand we all reflected upon what a tremendous year it had been for music\nat Imperial College. Will this year be\nas great? Will next summer\u2019s tour be\nquite as rampageous? Only time will\ntell. I have a sneaking suspicion 09/10\nis going to be a whole lot of fun.\nhelp if you are considering a conversion after you graduate, or even if you\nare just interested in law.\nI, myself, am a member of LawSoc\nwith a keen interest in Law and the\nfirst event of the year was a great suc-cess. A fellow Imperial alumnus, Andrew Moir, from the law firm, Herbert\nSmith, returned here to give an \u2018Introduction to Law\u2019 talk on Friday, 16th\nOctober. He gave a deep, inspiring insight into his career in Law after he had\ngraduated from Imperial. Having studied Physics here, he went on to qualify\nin Intellectual Property Law and is now\na successful solicitor advocate.\nAside from the talks and seminars\nthis term, I am particularly looking\nforward to the trip to the Old Bailey in\nNovember. Touring the Old Bailey will\nallow you to see barristers in action.\nAn experience not to be missed! In\naddition, the \u2018Negotiation Workshop\u2019\nwith the prestigious magic circle firm,\nAllen and Overy, in December will be\na notable opportunity. Networking\nLawSoc is back and YOU should join! says Mevani Jagodage\nwith other prospective lawyers and\nlaw firms is an essential part in pursuing Law in the future and there will be\nmany occasions throughout the year in\nwhich you can do so. Allen and Overy\nare sponsoring LawSoc so be prepared\nto meet with partners and alumni over\nthe coming year.\nSo why choose Law? Law is an exciting career path, which extends across\nmany academic fields \u2013 from criminal\nand insurance, to medical and patent\nlaw, as well as many more. Law firms\nare constantly looking to recruit students from a Science background, with\nsome even paying for you to do your\nconversion course! Getting into Law\ncan be challenging but an Imperial degree gives you the upper hand. If you\ntake the average law firm, the majority of solicitors did not do a Law de-gree, and come from a wide range of\ndisciplines.\nIf you are interested, come along to\nthe IC LawSoc events.

The confident RCSU President Katya-yani Vyas has issued an honest response to felix, which looks further\nto explain the situation she finds the\nRCSU currently in. The full statement\ncan be read to the immediate right.\nTwo responses from the Engineers\nhave been lodged with felix this week.\nCGCU Welfare Officer Alice Rowlands has taken the responsibility and\nstepped forward to reply on behalf of\nthe rest of the CGCU Committee.\nAn eleventh hour response from\nCGCU President Kirsty Patterson,\nwho chose not to speak to felix when\nthe original claims were made against\nher, has submitted the poem \u2018If\u2019 by\nRudyard Kipling. She admitted that\nit said \u201cthings more eloquently\u201d than\nher own response at present. These responses can be read on page 5.\nI\nwas contemplating this article for about a\nday before I began writing, mentally switching my style and approach, attempting to\nchurn out key phrases and generally putting\na lot more thought into it than I probably\nshould have (especially considering I was ambling\naround my department from lecture to lecture at\nthe time).\nI came to the conclusion, after many painful\nhours, that my previous attempts at dreaming up\na formal response filled with intricate arguments\nand carrying a defensive tone was essentially going to be counter-productive. Instead I have chosen to respond from the niche that I, along with\nall of you, occupy. I am writing firstly as a student,\na third year physics student to be precise. Therefore you can be guaranteed of my frankness and\nsincerity when discussing the issues facing us as a\nFaculty Union.\nThe duties of the RCSU committee begin in\nthe summer, meaning myself and members of our\nteam were on campus nearly every day in August\nand September. The Union, worryingly, became\nmore familiar to me than my own home and talk\nof plans for the year dominated the majority of my\nconversations, but I digress...\nHaving two major events in the first few weeks\nmeant a flurry of activity in the lead up to the\nstart of term. Publicity for the aptly named \u2018Welcome to the RCSU\u2019 was our main concern during\nFresher\u2019s fair, I am almost certain our Publicity Officer would have strangled me had I requested one\nmore flyer. Ultimately we held a very successful\ncomedy night which bodes well for the next two\nshows this term.\nWell, that is probably quite enough pre-amble.\nIt is no secret that the real issue here is the financial maelstrom following the Autumn Ball and the\nMasquerade Ball held by the RCSU and CGCU\nrespectively, and the article in last week\u2019s felix\nthat reported on it. As President of the RCSU, I\ncan only be held accountable for the actions of my\nown union so I would first like to offer an apology to anyone who did not enjoy themelves at our\nevents and indeed to anyone who did not hear\nabout them.\nIn the interview I gave to Mr Campos last week\nI made it clear that we do not run social events to\nmake a profit, just as we do not provide careers\ntalks or welfare sessions to make a profit. We have\na duty to our students to make our services affordable without compromising their quality. As a Faculty Union we have developed enormously in the last\nfew years under the astute leadership of my pred-ecessors, in particular Jennifer Morgan and David\nCharles, without whom the current foundations for\na successful future would not have been laid.\n\u201cI feel that any issues I had with\nhow the article was written are\nnow irrelevant and that we need\nto focus on moving forward.\u201d\nWhen I arrived at Imperial I had absolutely\nno awareness of the RCSU, we have come a long\nway since then and every committee member\nhas worked incredibly hard to ensure our steady\nprogress. We will continue to improve and grow\nstronger as long as we have the support of the students we represent.\nPerhaps I should now address some of the issues brought to my attention by the article in\nquestion. There were some questions raised over\nMr Campos\u2019 suitability in writing the article considering he currently holds the position of Science\nChallenge Chair and is therefore a member of the\nRCSU committee. My opinion is that the article\nwas written fairly and without bias, I sincerely\nhope that the our engineering counterparts do not\nfeel hard done by in this respect. In addition, I do\nnot believe any disrespect was meant towards the\nstudents who have contributed countless hours of\ntheir time to the RCSU and I would like to offer my\npersonal thanks to these people. I will continue to\nchampion the old adage; \u2018I do not agree with what\nyou have to say but will defend to the death you\nright to say it,\u2019 and feel that any issues I had with\nhow the article was written are now irrelevant and\nthat we need to focus on moving forward.\nSo, on to the points raised by Mr Campos regarding where our money would be better spent.\nIn terms of welfare we are pioneering two separate\nwelfare schemes this year, both of which you will\nhear about in due course (I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin\nthe surprise). There will be a number of sponsored\ncareer talks and education based seminars as well\nas our usual array of social events in the coming\nmonths. I will leave the shameless advertising at\nthat (or the Editor will charge me for this article). I\nhope that my point is making itself clear amongst\nthe rambling (forgive me, I have a tendency of\ndelivering impassioned monologues). We are\nworking hard to acquire your trust and provide\nyou with as many different events and services as\npossible. Fundamentally our aim is to allow you to\nget the most you can out of your experience as a\nstudent. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Imperial and it is my (and the rest of the committee\u2019s)\nintention, that you also do.\nI should probably conclude soon so I will end\non this note, that we are always welcome to suggestions and are looking to continuously improve.\nI implore you to get in touch with me (rcsu.presi-dent@imperial.ac.uk) if you have ideas as to how\nwe can provide a better event or think that we are\ncoming up short in a particular area.\nEssentially, every single one of us has a say in\nthe actions of our student\u2019s union so I urge you, as\na student and not an FU president, to get involved\nand believe in our potential. Perhaps if you do we\nwill avoid another article in felix this year and I\nwon\u2019t teeter on the verge of a breakdown or contemplate strangling a certain Editor. In the mean\ntime, I will strive to bring out the best in the RCSU.\nand hopefully build a union we can be proud of.\nFACULTY UNIONS RESPOND\nA response from RCSU President, Katya-yani Vyas\nRCSU President\nKatya-yani\nVyas was under\npressure last\nweek, but has\nissued an honest\nstatement on\nbehalf of her\ncommittee (see\nleft)\nTHE RCSU\n\n"

I don\u2019t apologise, as I\nwas perfectly within my rights.\nHowever it appears that a certain person ignored my rant and sent\nme a snotty e-mail. They will be dealt\nwith in one of the most brutal ways\npossible.\nAnyhoo, I am glad to report that the\nUnion has asked some of its Fun Police to take a bit of a back seat, but they\nare still there! Yet I do believe that the\nUnion is actually a good place to go.\nFood wise there is a lot of work to be\ndone, but where else in South Ken can\nyou go to get a cheap drink, and then\ntake it outside to a chill in a (normally)\ngrassy Quadrange? The other thing is\nthat all the money we spend in the Union comes straight back to us, which is\nnice, so I spend more.\nWell, I think that is enough of Union fun loving for quite sometime, and\nI will attempt to entertain you on the\nsubject of on goings in my life recently.\nHumm, well in order of chronological\norder I tore my foot up falling off a bus.\nI mean what type of idiot parks his bus\nup a distance from the kerb that your\nbrain tells you that you can make it\nwhen in reality I had no way of travelling from bus to pavement in one step?\nBut fuck me I was going to try it! I epic\nfailed. Moving on, me and a certain\nfemale are giving it another go. I was\nliterally high fiving people on the night\nbus. That was until I received many\nstrange looks and was forcibly re-moved. I maintain the real Police tolerate less fun than the Union Fun Police.\n(That\u2019s a good story but the majority is\nmade up- ed). Finally I spent the weekend down at Brands Hatch doing all the\nmechanics with the race team I work a\nbit for. We were doing pretty well, got a\nsecond in the first race and were looking good for two drivers on the podium\nin the second. That was until one of our\ndrivers piled flat chat into the side of\nanother who had spun and come to\nrest in the middle of the track. Luckily neither was hurt, but it took a good\n15 minutes to get them both out, the\nmarshals even put screens up round\nthe one car. We were shitting it and the\nboss went hypersonic with rage, was all\na bit if an eye opener, because they are\njust 17 and 20 and should have been\nhurt.

This will enable you to explain to your mates the exact nature\nof the journey to college with relative ease. You can also all try to \u2018outdo\u2019 each other on trips.

History is full of it, man against\nman. However, there\u2019s a non human\nenemy whom mankind has been battling against for hundreds of years.\nAlso, brace yourself- it can turn you to\nits side with little more than a sneeze.\nOf course, it\u2019s the flu (for those of you\nbelieving this article would be about\nPredator-sorry.)\nHumans are involved in an evolutionary war with the flu. The first recognized pandemic started in Asia in\n1580 and reached Europe within six\nmonths. The worst pandemic in history was the 1918 Spanish flu, which\ntotted up a fatality count of at least 20\nmillion. But these are all old statistics;\nshould we still be concerned about the\nseasonal phenomenon?\nYes. The modern day influenza is as\nwily as ever, killing hundreds of thousands every year. Sometimes referred\nto as RNA viruses, it can be split into\nthree genera; Influenza A, B and C.\nA virus can only survive by replicating within living cells. As they have\nshort generation times and high mutation rates, the flu can evolve quickly\nto avoid our defence systems. Natural\nselection allows for those viruses that\nsurvive to adapt quickly and successfully replicate, increasing their\nnumbers.\nImagine a production line of the\nflu virus inside our bodies. For arguments sake, there are 10, each one\nslightly genetically different from the\nnext by one base pair. Five of those\nare killed off by our immune systems\nkicking in straight away. Warning\nbells sound, a fever follows, they die,\nand we survive. That is round 1 and\nthere are still 5 remaining. We then go\nto the doctor who prescribes us some\ndrugs that help kill off 3 of these mutant strains. End of round 2 and still\nthere are 2 remaining mutants. It is\nthese 2 that have survived through\nnatural selection, adapted to our defenses and evolved. It is possible for\nno prisoners\u2019 policy. As we enter the\nwinter months, the incidence of swine\nflu has almost doubled to 53,000. The\nhead of flu planning at the NHS has\nstated that the health service should\n\u2018be prepared\u2019.\nSir Liam Donaldson, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, says the\nprojected total deaths for this winter\nhas dropped from 19,000 to 1,000.\nThis is less than the seasonal flu which\nhas an estimated fatality of 6,000 to\n8,000.\nLuckily for us, we have a few tricks\nup our sleeves too to counter-attack\nswine and common flu. We are able\nto adapt and survive just like our viral enemies. Vaccinations are a vital\nweapon in this evolutionary arms\nrace. Parrying their attacks year after year, with deaths, human immune\nsystems are still able to outwit their\nopponents. Annually scientists toil\nin labs to predict the evolution of the\nnext prominent flu strain and develop\nan effective vaccine that will minimize\ncasualties.\nThere are ways that the public can\nimpede the spread of flu. For example,\nkeeping distance from infected peo-ple, sneezing and coughing into tis-sues, washing hands thoroughly and\navoiding touching your nose, eyes and\nmouth.\nUnfortunately there is no estimate to\nhow long this arms race will continue\nor how fatal it will be. As Napoleon\nonce said, \u2018victory belongs to the most\npersevering\u2019 or just those that avoid\nbestiality.\nThe iGEM competition (international\ngenetically engineered machine com-petition) is an annual event which this\nyear took place at MIT between the\n31st october and 2nd November. 112\nteams from universities all over the\nworld partook in the competition, and\nso 4th can be considered a fantastic\nachievement. The team consisted of\nundergraduates from Bioengineering\nand Life sciences, and they were: Dineka Khurmi, David Roche, Kun Xue,\nRoyah Vaezi, James Field Tianyi Wang,\nNuri Purswani Ramchandi and Charles\nFracchia.\nPreparation for the iGEM competition is intense and is a commitment\nnot undertaken lightly. The team\nis recruited before Christmas and\npreparation involves a summer long\nUROP placement to push the project\nalong.\nThis year\u2019s project was titled \"The\nE.ncapsulator\", a platform through\nwhich therapeutics can be reliably\ntargeted to the intestine, an attractive area of research for commercial\npill development by pharmaceutical\ncompanies.\nThe project description on the website claims \u201cThe inspiration behind\nThe E.ncapsulator was the inherent\ndifficulty in delivering protein pharmaceuticals to the gut. Due to the delicate nature of proteins and the highly\nacidic environment present in the\nstomach\u201d\nIn an email sent out to life sciences\nundergraduate students the life sciences iGEM advisors, Paul Freemont and\nGeoff Baldwin, said \"This is a fantastic\nachievement given the growing size\nof the competition and illustrates yet\nagain what great undergraduate students we have at Imperial\". I would like\nto echo these sentiments with those of\nmy own and say that these students are\na credit to our university and deserve\ninfinite praise.\nImperial team finishes 4th overall and wins the award for best manufacturing project with \u201cThe E.ncapsulator\u201d\nThe first pandemic\nstarted in Asia in\n1580 ... should we\nstill be concerned\nabout the seasonal\nphenomenon?\nthese viruses to mix with other strains\nand survive.\nThe swine flu has been such a char-acter. The strain of H1N1 belongs to\nthe flu genus A. Upon analysis it was\nfound to be composed of four different types of flu: North American swine\nand avian influenza, human influenza\nand Asian/European swine influenza.\nThis potent mongrel virus has a \u2018take Forget \u2018catch it, bin it, kill it\u2019, the Imperial College fencing teams have it covered\nRight: The mechanism behind \u201cThe\nE.ncapsulator\u201d which came 4th out of\n112 entries at the event\n\n"

I am in\nmy fourth year of working for felix an\nnever before have I seen so much enthusiasm and interest to contribute.\nSo much so that many articles have to\nwait an issue to be put in on account of\nthe limited space!\nI have also been pleasantly surprised\nby the quality of the writing and depth\nof insight especially from people who\nhave professed to knowing nothing\nabout art and who claim to have never\nwritten before. Please keep it coming.\nAs Rosie said last week, autumn is\ndefinitely the hottest time of the cultural year with far too many plays and\ngalleries to fit into the busy schedules\nof two masters students.\nOver the course of last weekend Rosie and I used our press privileges to\ntake in two separate exhibitions at the\nTate Modern, only after delving into\nthe darkness inside a huge steel box.\nPolish artist Miroslaw Balka\u2019s How It\nIs consumes the TM\u2019s turbine hall with\nits presence and makes for an at first\neery and then extremely fun experi-ence, albeit lasting under 5 minutes.\nNext to each other on the fourth\nfloor are Pop Life: Art in a Material\nWorld and Pure Beauty, a retrospective of John Baldessari\u2019s work. After\nstrolling serenely and unmolested by\ntourists through the latter, the former\u2019s\nbustling and heady mix of pounding\nmusic, wall floor and ceiling colour\nand separate \u2018adults only\u2019 section (read:\nthe Jeff Koon porn room) is a stark\ncontrast and feels more like a chinese\nshopping mall at times. For those who\nhaven\u2019t experienced the People\u2019s Republic, this means bright lights, abrasive volume levels and enough flashing\nlights and colour to induce epilepsy.\nCompletely different to any exhibition I\u2019d ever experienced, I cherished\nour brief visit for its originality and\nits ability to drive home the banal\ncommericalism that pervades various\nforms of art today.\nWatch this space next Friday for\nthose reviews and enjoy this week\u2019s!\nCosy in the Cocoon\nAspiring physicist Rox Middleton and mathematician Matthew\nColvin find themselves taken with Biology\nT\nhe Natural History Museum means a great big\ndinosaur. We all know\nthat. Well hold onto your\nfossils amigo, because\nthere\u2019s a new exhibition in town that\u2019s\nset to change this, well, muddied in-terpretation. We were lucky enough\nto take a tour around the Museum\u2019s\nnewly opened Darwin Centre and its\nominous sounding \u2018Cocoon\u2019 \u2013 actually\na beautiful feat of architecture with an\nintriguing purpose to boot. Looking\na little like the Gherkin crossed with\nsome sort of monstrous egg, it\u2019s as if\nyou\u2019re entering a Bond Villain\u2019s secret\nlair \u2013 all clinical white walls and masses of laboratory space. But this new\nbuilding wasn\u2019t made with the intent of\ndestruction, but instead preservation.\nThe Cocoon is home to an enormous\ncollection of British botanical and insect specimens, housed in massive\nenvironment-controlled storage. Built\nfor the Natural History Museum\u2019s 20\nmillion plant and insect species, the\ntop few floors of the building are open\nto the public as a fascinating exhibition\ndetailing the everyday life of scientists\nwho work at the museum collecting,\npreserving and identifying. Each floor\nalso looks directly into the labs and offices where the real work takes place.\nThe beautiful exhibits of specimens\nfor which the museum is known really\ncome into their own here. In the big\nwhite spaces even the most mundane\nofferings of nature are gorgeous and\neasy to examine closely. There are also\na few tantalising tidbits of information\nabout some displays but they definitely\nleave you wanting much more detail.\nFortunately help is at hand in the form\nof a nifty little swipe card feature, allowing you to collect information on\nvarious aspects of the exhibition that\nyou would like to research further back\nonline at home (though it remains to\nbe seen whether detailed information\non Welsh Groundsel will take priority\nover Facebook any time soon). Something that also sets this place apart\nfrom other exhibitions is the vast\namount of interactivity. Many, many\ntouch screens can be found, offering\ndetailed yet concise information about\nmyriad aspects of the Cocoon.\nOf course, with this interactivity being hugely responsive, we found that\nthe majority of screens and films were\nsoon stopped by children (and adults)\nmashing their fists onto the tables.\nThis interrupted the fascinating cyber-happenings; all very irritating \u2013 but\nthere\u2019s plenty to look at so you can take\nyour time and watch something else;\nor alternatively bring along a threatening weapon.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and thinking\nthat it definitely isn\u2019t your cup of tea \u2013\nor kettle of fish, or whatever \u2013 a rethink\nis highly recommended. This isn\u2019t just\nof interest for biologists, it could be of\ninterest to anyone. If drawers of insects\nor butterflies aren\u2019t your thing, then\nthe depth of detail into what keeps a\nmuseum running might well be. And\nanyway, if it kept an aspiring physicist and mathematician interested for\nabout 45 minutes, then there\u2019s simply\nno reason why you wouldn\u2019t have a\ngood time either!\nVery painful youths in twenties Vienna\nLooking for a pretentious night out? Look no further than the existential Pains of Youth, says Rox Middleton\nT\nhis is a play about students who spend a lot of\ntime together, work hard,\nlike to get drunk and talk\nabout the Big Questions\nand become infatuated with each\nother in various combinations. While\nexpressing their respective feelings\nabout said Big Questions, they also\ntake themselves incredibly seriously. I\ndon\u2019t know whether that sounds like\nsomething you could relate to.\nSo it\u2019s supposedly about students like\nyou. Well, maybe. These are medical\nstudents after all. It\u2019s also set in Vienna\nin 1923 and is pretty damn existential-ist, which manifests itself in much talk\nabout the futility of life and suicide. As\nthe title indicates, it attempts to capture the disease of being young, thus is\nfilled with awkwardness and disjointed\ndialogue. What with all that, the excellent set and epochs of twelve tone mu-sic, it\u2019s fantastically atmospheric and\nintense. These people know how to\nmake a scene, but there are also loads\nof genuinely funny lines and farcical\nmoments (which no doubt highlight\nlife\u2019s absurdity). The awkward young\nmaid (Sian Clifford), who is slowly\ntransformed into a loveably naive pros-titute, is especially funny.\nLaura Elphinstone and Lydia Wilson\u2019s characterisations are also particularly good but personally I thought the\nprop changes were absolutely brilliant.\nModern people in sharp suits carry\nitems onto stage wrapped in enormous\nsheets of plastic with lots of blue lights\nand loud, tense music, during which all\nthe characters freeze in the dark. I really have no idea why, except that it is\nunspeakably cool, so I\u2019ll leave the interpretation to you.\nAltogether it\u2019s a very enjoyable night\nout and if you\u2019re feeling pretentious\nyourself, or looking for a play about\npretentious young people (inc. urgent\nself-obsession/earnest sense of futil-ity), this is certainly one for you. For\neveryone else, I think it\u2019s too far removed from the real world. While the\nmisery of youth is overpowering, it\nis also pointless. Although this is the\nthrust of the play (existentialist, innit?)\nit certainly takes its time getting there\nand meanwhile it might be better all\nround if they just got a life and thought\nabout someone else for a change.\nAfter the massive cultural upheaval\nthat was swilling about all over Vienna\nat the time, it\u2019s quite likely that these\nparticular ridiculous post-adolescent\nemotions were far more important\nthan modern ones. However, that\ndoesn\u2019t change the fact that they are\nstill boringly self-involved young peo-ple. The pains of youth are captured\nincredibly well by the director but, to\nbe honest, if you\u2019re living the dream\nalready you probably don\u2019t need to\nwatch a play about it.\nPains of Youth is on at the National\nTheatre until 21 January 2010\nTickets start at \u00a310 Katie Mitchell\u2019s Pains of Youth is on at the Cottleslowe theatre at the NT\n\n"

This\ngeek appeal is played on to with great\neffect in the latest horror comedy flick\nZombieland.\nZombieland tells the story of Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), who, in his past\nlife was a World-Of-Warcraft-playing\nmountain-dew-drinking geek, but now\nhe\u2019s one of the few people around still\ncapable of speech. His talent for survival is due to a set of \u201crules\u201d which he\nfollows, ranging from \u201cbeware of bathrooms\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t be a hero\u201d. Columbus begins the movie trying to make\nthe journey from his college campus\nin Austin Texas, to his family home\nin Columbus Ohio. Soon enough he\nhooks up with patriarchal hard man\ncharacter (Woody Harrelson) and\nsister pair Wichita (Emma Stone)\nand Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), and\nthey journey together, albeit with their\nown separate destinations.\nThe film is supremely funny. With\na great script and brilliant performances from the main cast. Of particular note is Jesse Eisenburg in his\nportrayal of the neurotic adolescent\nlead. One of the scenes in which he\nshines is a flashback to the moment his\nhot girl-next-door neighbour bursts\nthrough his door in need of comfort-ing. Flash forward to the next morning\nand she\u2019s zombied up and trying to eat\nhim, Eisenberg captures the pubescent\nawkwardness brilliantly. And yet Zombieland\u2019s comic thread is punctuated\nby poignant moments of emotional in-tensity. These contrast brilliantly with\nthe light-hearted tone of the rest of the\nfilm and allows the viewer to connect\nTimDavies\nTimDavies\nJean-Stephane Sauvaire\u2019s new film\nJohnny Mad Dog is a passionate portrayal of a war stricken African coun-try, told from the perspectives of two\nchildren at the front of the War, where\nrape and murder is commonplace. One\nof them is a child soldier for the \u2018death\ndealers\u2019, who calls himself \u2018Johnny Mad\nDog\u2019. The other is Laokole, a girl who\nhas lost everything from the war. Their\npaths intertwine throughout the tale, as\nthe war comes to a climax.\nThe film is based on a book by Emmanuel Dongola, who escaped the\nCongo in 1997 when civil war broke\nout. The film is startling and brutally\nviolent from start to finish, as the drug\nfuelled child troops are sent to murder and pillage under the command of\nGeneral Never Die.\nJohnny Mad Dog is the leader of the\nsmall boys unit, and carves a path of\nsavage violence throughout the coun-try. His second in command, \u2018No Good\nAdvice\u2019 is younger and even more sadistic than Johnny Mad Dog, and is\ncompletely void of any human-like\nemotions or qualities. Along with the\nrest of the unit, they are a killing ma-chine, following orders blindly from\nGeneral Never Die.\nThe film illustrates the power of the\nfearless child soldier. Cocaine is rubbed\ninto open wounds to frenzy the troops\nand to make them forget their hunger\nand fatigue before combat. The fierceness of the child soldiers is comparable\nto Fernando Meirelles\u2019 brilliant City of\nGod (2003), where children with no\nfuture are forced into fighting for rival\ngangs in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.\nIn the broken world of war, all morals\nare lost. The self-named Johnny Mad\nDog claims he has forgotten his original name \u2013 and most likely all compassion and ethics that came with it.\nThe encounters between Laokole and\nJohnny Mad Dog show a more human\nside to Johnny, as the captivating story\nunfolds.\nThe film is shot in a twitchy handheld camera style (the latest fashion in\ncinematography), which some people\nmay find disorientating, but does give\nthe viewer a more down-to-earth look\nat the characters.\nThe soundtrack emphasises the\ncoldness of an already gut-twisting\ntale. After the chilling final scene, you\nare left with Billie Holiday\u2019s haunting\nsong \u2018Strange Fruit\u2019 alongside distressing images of war that will leave you\nspeechless.\nStefan Zeeman\nStefan Zeeman\nWar children, it\u2019s just a shot\naway in Johnny Mad Dog\non a deeper level with the characters,\nwhilst never seeming out of place.\nWith the universal success of Shaun\nOf The Dead bringing horror comedy to the mainstream there have\nbeen a raft of new films to the genre,\nwith mixed reception. However Zombieland has already become highest\ngrossing zombie film ever, overtaking\nthe remake of Dawn of The Dead. And\nit\u2019s not without reason, Zombieland\nis a brilliantly funny take on the zombie apocalypse concept; a great script,\ngreat casting and solid direction make\nthis an autumn release well worth\nchecking out.\nPriests, Perverts and Passion\nThe wierd and wonderful Japan through the eyes of Sion Sono\nI mention Japanese cinema, you\nthink The Ring, Godzilla and anime.\nTrue, the films of Miyazaki and co.\nhave been delighting us for years and\nJ-horror recently hit mainstream\nwestern theatres, however look\nbeneath the bright colours or dark\nshadows and we find another side\nto Japanese flms. With the recent\nspate of manufacturated \u2018indie\u2019 films\nrolled off the hollywood production\nline (Little Miss Sunshine, Juno etc.)\nit\u2019s refreshing to watch a genuine\nalternative film and it is of no surprise\nto me that it came from Japan.\nLove Exposure takes all types of genres from Japan\u2019s rich film heritage; the\nperiod dramas of Kurosawa are combined with the Yakuza films of Fukasaku (Battle Royale), mixed with elements of Christian guilt, revenge and\nan underlying theme of romance with\na subtle slice of dark comedy. This film\nwill make you laugh, weep and cringe\nand at four hours long I was never once\nbored.\nDirected by avant-garde poet/con-troversial filmmaker Sion Sono, Love\nExposure is based around protagonist\nYu in his search for his true love. When\nYu\u2019s beloved mother dies, his devout\nCatholic father Tetsu decides to become a priest. After a brief affair with\na parishioner, Tetsu begins to force\nhis guilt upon Yu by making him confess his sins every day. Soon Yu finds\nhimself deliberately commiting sins to\nconfess to his a father and finds that\nthe ultimate way to upset him is to become a \u2018hentai\u2019 or pervert.\nIt\u2019s not long before Yu is addicted to\nsin and trains in the art of \u2018tosatu\u2019, using\nhis newly learnt ninja skills to take up-skirt photos of girl\u2019s underwear (for-tunately it seems that every girl in Tokyo wears really short skirts) until he\nfinds the panties of his true love! Enter\nYoko- fierce, beautiful but man hating,\nwho finds herself accidently attracted\nto \u2018Miss Scorpion\u2019 who is Yu dressed in\ndrag as a dare from his friends. Unfortunately for Yu, Yoko finds him repulsive and brands him a pervert. Whilst\nin the background lurks the mysterious Koike and a creepy cult whose\ntrue intentions are revealed as the film\nprogresses.\nThe majority of the film is shot in\nclose up and medium shots giving it\na slightly documentary feel, including faded \u2019home movie\u2019 style footage\nfor the purpose of flashbacks. Sion\nSono\u2019s sense of pace is almost incred-ible, after starting the film with a gentle coming-of-age (however twisted)\nparable he kick starts the second half\nwith unlimited energy maintaing your\nattention right till the end credits. The\ncast assembled are mostly newcomers\nbut pull off very polished performances with utmost sincerity, even when\ndebating the ethics of perverts. The\nsoundtrack is an odd mix of western\nclassical (Ravel\u2019s Bolero), pop punk\nand electro which somehow perfectly\ncompliments the film.\nAlthough Sono has amalgamated his\nnation\u2019s iconic genres together he also\ndraws on some Western inspiration\ntoo. The themes of crossdressing and\nmis-identity continues Japanese directors\u2019 love of Shakespeare (Kurosawa\u2019s\nepic Ran was an adaptation of King\nLear) and it\u2019s impossible not to notice\nthe resemblence of Koike and her gang\nto Alex and his Droogs from Kubrick\u2019s\nA Clockwork Orange.\nSo what has Sono produced? A film\nof extraordinary storytelling which is\nsurprisingly accessible considering its\nrunning time. It gained great reviews\non the festival circuit (it won the Caligary award at Berlin) and now joins the\ngrowing ranks of alternative Japanese\nand East Asian films which blow any\nof the \u2018cutting-edge indie cinema\u2019 from\nAmerica out of the water.\nEdKnock\nEdKnock Film Editor\nProbably the most inconvenient time to forget where you put your keys\n\n"

Make sure you check\nit out, www.felixmusic.tk, and\nremember now you can tell us\nquickly and easily what you think of\nthe articles by commenting, so let the\ntroll within you free (or you could\ncriticize constructively, whatever that\nmeans). Special thanks to our web-edi-tor Christopher Walmsley for all his effort getting the website up. Also we\u2019ve\nstarted a felix music group on last.fm.\nEvery week, last.fm will calculate the\ngeneral music taste of the Imperial students in the group and from this we\u2019ll\ncreate a top-40 of the most popular art-ists/tracks for Imperial. Sign up to last.\nfm, download the scrobbler and join\nour group last.fm/group/Felix+Music.\nNow onto the music: I\u2019m heading\nback a little this week. 2Pac\u2019s double\nalbum All Eyez on Me, released in\n1996, constitutes the epitome of 2Pac\u2019s\nthug sensibilities. He raps with precision on all the facets of a thug\u2019s life: jail,\nbitches, liquor, weed and death backed\nup with bumping & grinding G-funk\ngrooves. He\u2019s playful and thoughtful,\nalways referring to his own death (not\na clue that he\u2019s still alive, but a reflection of the reality of his life) and while\nhe raps about being better than his en-emies, his deft and smooth lyrical flow\nproves it.\nEven further back in time, The Last\nPoets\u2019 debut album titled The Last\nPoets, dating all the way back from the\n1970s, derides much of the behaviour\nthat 2Pac would later celebrate. This\ngroup of poets and musicians basically\ncreated rap music and in doing so laid\nbare the problems that the black community faced. The fact that exhortations like \u201cWake up n***ers\u201d weren\u2019t\nheeded make this album all the more\npoignant.\nKadhim Shubber\nKadhim Shubber Music Editor\nReviews\nThis single oozes power, with a post-punk electric sound that resurfaces\nmemories of Joy Division. Sinister eerie vocals, low-frequency drones and\nmoments of glory. Not light listening,\nbut a band to watch. -Luke Turner\nThe second single from the AIC album\nis disappointing if we consider the edgy\ndarkness of the rest of the release. The\nopening cello piece adds atmosphere but\nit feels like a throwaway track to secure\nairplay in the US. Unchallenging, slightly\nwhiny, reminiscent of (dare I say it) Nickelback. Well, it\u2019s not that bad.\nALICE IN CHAINS\nBLACK GIVES WAY\nTO BLUE\nSINGLE\nC\nosmo Jarvis is a puzzle to\nsay the least. The 19 year old\nis by no means a \u2018finished\npiece\u2019. There\u2019s too much raw\ncreativity rushing about, leaving too\nmany scuff marks lying around to relate him, or his talent, to polished mar-ble. Truthfully, it\u2019s not always fantastic\nstuff, at times you find yourself wishing\na lyric here or there had been tweaked.\nHowever, this is completely overshadowed by the powerful and playful imagination behind the charming,\nthoughtful and unconventional music.\nHe\u2019s puzzling because he seems unafraid to write songs in almost every\nstyle imaginable. Some songs mix\nscreaming punk vocals with quick-fire\nspoken word, while an eclectic mixture\nof banjo, blues guitar riffs and jazz piano jump in, straight out of nowhere,\njust when you thought you\u2019d gotten\nto grips with his music. Sometimes\nhis music has a country-folk sensib-litiy but at other times you wonder if\nthat\u2019s not a little bit of reggae creeping\nin from the periphery. He seems perfectly comfortable dipping in and out\nof a range of genres and does so with\nconsummate skill and confidence.\nLyrically, Cosmo Jarvis becomes\neven more puzzling. He\u2019s constantly\njuxtaposing style, elegantly rhyming\none line and then going off-kilter the\nnext. Luckily the music provides a firm\nbackdrop in front of which the thread-like mental state of his characters are\ndisplayed through the content and\nform of his lyrics. He revels in mixed\nmessages like in the chorus of \u201cSunshine and Dandelions\u201d, \u2018sunshine and\ndandelions/ severed heads and blood,/\nfirst love on a sunny island/ bodies in\nthe mud\u201d. Also in \u201cClean My Room\u201d\nOne to watch - Cosmo Jarvis\nWith a reputation that precedes itself,\nbeing reported as unlikely to feature in\nthe album, \u201cWho\u2019d Have Known\u201d does\nfeature. The recycled melody appears\nas the chorus, resembling the M&S\nadvert. It is a rarity where Ms. Allen is\nnot talking about drugs, sex or fame;\nmerely the feeling of blossoming new\nlove. She croons in her signature sick-ly-sweet voice and that London twang,\nall of the melodies allow a glimpse into\nher domestic love-life. Reluctant to allow access to her private life, Ms. Allen\nhas turned this idea of young love on\nits head by making a video for this song\nbased on the act of kidnap by an obsessive fan. - Joanna Cai\nBreed 77 are a Gibraltarian-born band\ncurrently based in the UK who fuse\ntheir Pantera-inspired brand of heavy\nmetal with flamenco, resulting in some\ninteresting and genuinely original\nsongs. Aside from the typical endless\nsoloing and soaring choruses, frontman Paul Isola makes the affair atypical by effortlessly switching between\nEnglish and Spanish, as well as going\nfrom all-out growls to graceful sing-ing. Though there\u2019s nothing particularly new about the heavy riffs, there\u2019s\nenough diversity in song structure and\ntempo shifts to keep the average metal lover interested throughout. Plus\nthere\u2019s a bitchin cover of The Cranberries\u2019 \u201cZombie\u201d!! -Greg Power\nBREED 77\nINSECTS\nALBERT\nPRODUCTIONS\nALBUM\nThe sound of a young, laid-back band\npulling melancholic indie pop from\ntheir arses \u2013 and they don\u2019t care. If they\nwere \u2018hung up\u2019 by a rope around their\nneck they might have something more\nto get excited about. Cheer up and take\na walk in the park. - Tom Jennings\nTHE CHEEK\nHUNG UP\nA&M\nSINGLE\nThis record sounds like sonic sun-shine. Muted guitars, tinkling pianos\nand crisp melodies meander through\nthe delightful \u2018Rollerblades\u2019 whilst in\ncontrast \u2018Money box\u2019 is an upbeat, ska-like finger to all things materialistic.\nThe lyrics give an edge to these buoyant pop songs with Eliza showing her\nnorth London roots in \u2018Police Car\u2019 and\n\u2018Go Home\u2019. Comparisons with Regina\nSpektor and the better bits of Lily Allen could easily be made but there\u2019s\nno formula-driven lyrical nonsense\nhere. Overall it\u2019s an enjoyable, sunday-morning of a record. - Tom Hird\nELIZA DOOLITTLE\nPARLOPHONE\nALBUM\n\u201c(If you\u2019re wondering if I want you to)\nI want you to\u201d is an upbeat single from\nthe latest Weezer album consisting of\nbrash drumming, pleasant melodies and\nthe occasional percussion-led phrase of\nwhat can only be described as a nerd\u2019s attempt to rap.\nIt features a playful acoustic guitar\ntheme behind the classic Californian\nvocals of Rivers Cuomo; and although\nit probably won\u2019t be a golden oldie\nin years to come, it makes for good\nenough listening to at the present as\nyour standard Weezer song.\n- Joanna Cai\nWEEZER\nRADITUDE\nINTERSCOPE\nRECORDS\nSINGLE\nDETACHMENTS\nCIRCLES\nTHISISNOTANEXIT\nSINGLE\nIt can\u2019t be said that this is original, but\nthis electro-folk-pop sound has haunting character. \u2018Under The Sheets\u2019, uses\nelectro sounds in a captivating way\nthat will make you want to listen again,\neven though it isn\u2019t initially appealing.\nGentle dream-like vocals over thick\nsynthesizers and hammering drums, a\nquirky combination despite lack of real\ninstruments. -Luke Turner\nELLIE GOULDING\nUNDER THE\nSHEETS\nPOLYDOR\nI expected something exciting from\nan electronic rock band consisting of\nthe recent addition to U.N.K.L.E and a\ncontributor to QOTSA frontman, Josh\nHomme\u2019s stoner-rock Desert Sessions.\nBut the result is bland, generic and in\nno way exciting. The vocals are soul-less, the music is flat, and to be honest the songs are all extremely similar.\nIt quickly becomes apparent that File\u2019s\nnew project shares the same flaws attributed to U.N.K.L.E.\u2019s last album. Coincidence? I think not. -Greg Power\nWE FELL TO\nEARTH\nIN STEREO\nALBUM\ntell us what you\nthink, music.felix@\ngmail.com\nHe\u2019s wearing a hoody and not looking at the camera, he must be cool\nfelix music\nhits the web!\nGo to\nfelixmusic.tk\nfelix music\nhits the web!\nGo to\nfelixmusic.tk\nwhere the line \u2018clean my room and\ndump my girlfriend\u2019 warps into \u2018gonna\nburn my room and kill my girlfriend\u2019.\nDefinitely puzzling and inarguably\nintriguing.\nIt\u2019s pretty much impossible to sum\nup this guy. He\u2019s written about 300\nsongs, his debut album is an 18 track\ndouble album, split between songs\nabout pubescent desire (in all its immature glory) and songs about abusive\nfathers and drunken mothers. He\u2019s already written his 2nd album, due for\nrelease in 2010 and is working on the\n3rd. He\u2019s a prodigious talent, raw and\nunrestricted in subject matter nor style\nand he even has a bloody sea shanty\nsong about gay pirates who are made to\nwalk the plank for their \u2018sins\u2019. It\u2019s freaking fantastic but unfortunately not\non the album. Listen to this, his next\nproject is a short film about a man who\ntakes himself hostage. In short, my\nhead can\u2019t deal with the reality of this\nguy existing. \u2013 Kadhim Shubber\nThe double album \u201cHumasyouhitch\n& Sonofabitch\u201d is out on the 16th\nLILY ALLEN\nIT\u2019S NOT YOU,\nIT\u2019S ME\nCAPITOL\nRECORDINGS\nALBUM\nSINGLE\n\n"

Fortunately dD1\npulled it out of the bag on sudden\ndeath, winning 7-6.\ndD2 and dD3 were enjoying themselves more against more evenly\nmatched opponents and won their\ngames to set up a dD2 vs dD3 final for\nThe Spoon.\nAn enjoyable match produced great\nperformances from the freshers and\nexperienced players, with dD2 sneaking in a couple of extra scores to win.\ndD1 then played Surrey Scorpions\nagain in a 3 vs 4 game which would determine whether dD1 would qualify for\nthe Division 1 or Division 2 Nationals.\nThe Scorpions came out stronger in\nthis tie, and both teams were trading\npoints in another tight game.\nAfter the final buzzer, Surrey had\nemerged 7-6 victors placing dD1 in\nfourth.\ndD1 are looking forward to proving\ntheir worth in the Division 2 Nationals in Manchester in a couple of weeks\ntime.

If you\nplay sport at Imperial, this sent-ance is not so much of a shock,\nas the vast majority of our teams\nregularly beat them; the Football\nClub don\u2019t even put out their 1st team\nagainst the Medicals at Varsity. What is\nsurprising, is that this headline is now\nassociated with the Rugby 1st team, as\nshown in last week\u2019s issue.\nFor years we have been trying to get\none over the old enemy, yet time and\ntime again we fail to per-form and end\nup getting more and more agitated that\nwe were unable to beat them. First of\nall, let\u2019s just put into context the recent 13-6 win for Imperial. As already\nmentioned, Imperial have not beaten\nthe Medicals for several years now, in\nfact, the last time the 1st XV beat them\nwas in the Gutteridge Cup Final (ULU\nCup) in 2004. That is just before I even\nstarted at Imperial, whilst the majority\nof you were probably learning how to\napproach and talk to a girl (admittedly,\nfor some of you, this didn\u2019t even happen then but probably occurred quite a\nfew years later!).\nIn recent years, the game has been\nclose, with the last two Varsity encounters both going into extra time - both\ntimes, Imperial were in the lead and\nthen lost it at the end. The same can\nbe said for the 2nd and 3rd XV, whose\ngames are just as close (I have to point\nout that the 3rd team have managed\nto beat their opposition on one occa-sion). Even the Old Boys\u2019 team had a\nchance a few weeks ago, and the same\nthing happened then as it did when\nthey were students; to put it bluntly,\nthey bottled it.\nThis is the crux of the matter when\nthe Imperial rugby teams play the\nMedicals, their nerves get the better of\nthem. Thanks to live reporting talents\nof an old club captain, by this I mean\nregular e-mails during the game, I was\nable to follow the match from Poitiers\nin France. Below is the transcript of\none of his emails:\n\u201c13-6\nGodfrey pen...I say it again...they are\nonly in the game cos of the\npens. Our boys are looking a bit\nnervy.\u201d\nMy heart almost sank when I saw\nthat last sentence. The one thing that\nhas let us down time and time again\nare our nerves, and I was hoping the\nsame wouldn\u2019t happen again. Luckily,\nthey held out to the end and came away\nas the victors.\nThe problem we have is a simple one.\nWhenever Imperial play the Medicals,\nthere is a lot of hype, a huge buildup lasting several weeks with people\nsaying such things as \u201cWe must beat\nthem\u201d and \u201cThis is the only game that\nmatters this season\u201d. As a result, a lot\nof pressure is put on the players to perform and get out of the rut that they\nhave been in for nearly six years, and\nas we have seen, sometimes nerves get\nthe better of you. This is what I don\u2019t\nreally understand, why is so much\nhype and expectation put on the games\nagainst the medics? Do you think the\nsame amount of pressure was put on\nthe players for this weeks game against\nChichester Men\u2019s 1st?\nWithout the pressure to win, players\nare more relaxed and end up playing\nto a better standard than if they were\nnervous. This is the same for any sport;\ntake the Football Club who, like I have\nalready mentioned, don\u2019t even put out\ntheir 1st team against the Medicals at\nVarsity. Instead, what they do is let the\nleavers play and the atmosphere is a lot\nmore relaxed with people having fun.\nAlternatively, you don\u2019t want them to\nbe too relaxed otherwise they won\u2019t\nperform well again. It is finding that\nbalance of being relaxed yet, at the\nsame time, having the desire to beat\nthe opposition that is the key.\nI have already heard muttering about\nVarsity and how the recent win means\nthat things should be a lot better for\nIC this year. Bollocks! Forget about\nVarsity, it\u2019s four months away! A lot\nof things can happen in that time. In\nfact, it would probably be best if the\nWith this in mind we were expecting\nto lose the game and finish with a resounding last, but with our first couple\nof races we saw that each member of\nthe new Imperial Team had the skill to\nwin races, we just needed to work together as a team to get the results.\nLarge amounts of weed at the first\nmark gave us our first win against ULU\n3rds when Devin Goonewardena aggressively forced a ULU boat right into\nit, taking them out of the race and giving us a one boat advantage to go on\nfor an easy win.\nOur aggressive tactics paid off until\nwe started pushing things too far and\nour commodore, Gavin MacAulay collided with another boat and received a\npenalty for his careless actions.\nOur overall position was a respectable 4th out of 6. Unfortunately our\nclubhouse bar had been drunk dry\nthe previous Wednesday for the Pirate\nthemed Social, so we couldn\u2019t celebrate\nin a fitting manner.\nSunday brought more racing and\nmuch more wind. A series of 10\nshort, fast races took place and an F1\nstyle high scoring system was imple-mented. Imperial\u2019s very own Michelle\nRyder came 2nd out of the 12 boats\npresent, sailing well in the challenging\nconditions.\nThe Foot proved to be a good warm\nup for our next event- the Welsh Dragon, where we will have to listen to all\nthe Welsh men moan about the male/\nsheep ratio.\nGirls, Weed, Booze... And a\nLittle bit of Sailing\n\u201cWhy is so\nmuch hype and\nexpectation put on\nthe games against\nthe medics?\u201d\nplayers forgot about the win all to-gether, for now, and focused on each\ngame individually. The one thing that\nthey should take away is confidence.\nThey need to believe that they are\ngood enough to beat any opposition\nthat comes up against them. The same\napplies to all the other sports, this includes you Netball girls out there who I\nknow have been having the same problem as the rugby club with respect to\nbeating the Medics. Never ever think\nthat your opponent is better than you,\notherwise they WILL get the better of\nyou. Be strong and confident in your\nabilities and everything will work out.\nAnd most of all, forget about Varsity.\nContinued from Back Page\nImperial\u2019s forward dominance of their own scrums gave the impressive backline time to attack the medics\nImperial Sailors fight for water at the first event of the year: The \u201cFoot Trophy\u201d\n\n"

I would therefore ask you to\nstep down from the Council with immediate effect.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not about Prof Nutt\u2019s views,\nwhich I respect though I don\u2019t agree\nwith them,\u201d said Mr Johnson.\nIn his reply, Prof Nutt said he was\n\u201cdisappointed\u201d by Alan Johnson\u2019s view\nadding \u201cwhilst I accept that there is a\ndistinction between scientific advice\nand government policy there is clearly\na degree of overlap. If scientists are\nnot allowed to engage in the debate it\nundermines a major source of carefully considered and evidence-based\nadvice.\u201d\nDespite his sacking, Professor Nutt\nstands by the evidence and his belief\nthat cannabis should not be a Class B\ndrug based upon its effects.\nHe described his sacking as a \u201cserious challenge to the value of science in\nrelation to the government\u201d.\n\u201cI am disappointed because, to be\nhonest, all I was trying to do was help.\nI wasn\u2019t challenging the government,\u201d\nsaid the former chief drugs advisor. \u201cIt\nwould be much simpler if they took\nthat advice rather than getting tangled\nup I other sorts of messages which\nfrankly do confuse the public.\u201d\nProfessor Nutt, a highly respected\nleading addiction expert said he was\nnot prepared to \u201cmislead\u201d the public\nabout the effects of drugs to convey a\n\u201cmessage\u201d on behalf of the government\ninstead of presenting the facts.\nPhil Willis MP, chairman of the science and technology select commit-tee, said he would write to the Home\nSecretary to ask for clarification as to\nwhy Prof David Nutt had been sacked\n\u201cat a time when independent scientific\nadvice to government is essential\u201d. \u201cIt\nis disturbing if an independent scien-Governmental\nIgnorance\nT\nhe sacking of\nACMD Chair Professor David Nutt\nis an outrage. Scientists must be\nindependent and report the\nfacts honestly and without\nrepression.\nEven before the ACMD had\nreleased its findings into canna-bis, the government had decided to reclassify the drug to Class\nB. That was a ridiculous move,\nmaking the Council superfluous and undermining scientific\nevidence.\nJust like any other illness, drug\nabuse should be a public health\nissue, not criminal. Harm reduction is the most important\nobjective, not criminalising the\nvast number of people using illegal substances recreationally.\nThere is the argument that\nincreasing the classification of a\nsubstance sends out a message\nthat drugs are bad. Surely then\nevery drug should be Class A.\nThis undermines the classification system.\nThe point of the classification\nsystem is to inform the public\non how harmful substances are.\nIt should be a scale built upon\ntruth and evidence, not second-guessing and attempts to \u201cwarn\u201d\npeople of dangers that are not\neven there.\nJacqui Smith defended her\ndecision to ignore the ACMD\u2019s\nrecommendation for cannabis\nto remain a Class C substance\nby claiming that the debate has\nshifted due to the introduction\nof skunk. However, it is exactly\nthis type of cannabis that the\nACMD investigated and what\nprompted the report initially.\nIs it not obvious that Prof Nutt\nand the ACMD are more informed of the evidence than any\npolitician? Not to Alan Johnson,\nwho disagrees with Prof Nutt\u2019s\nview on cannabis despite his expertise and time spent studying\nthe drug.\nAnn Widdecombe, writing in\nthe Guardian, claims that there\nis a united scientific view that\n\u201cdrugs are harmless\u201d\n. This is\ncomplete nonsense, drugs are\nharmful but to differing degrees,\nnot all can be lumped in Class A.\nThe public need the truth, we\nshould not be hidden from it by\npoliticians who want nothing\nmore than to be re-elected by\nthe tabloid-reading electorate.\nAlan Johnson has shown his\ntrue colours, disregarding scientific and expert advise just as his\npredecessor Jacqui Smith did.\nScience is important for educating the public and govern-ment. Independence is necessary for scientific advisors to\nensure free thought.\nReinstate Professor Nutt.\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack Politics Editor\nScience\nDismissed\nP\noliticians have a long\nhistory of \u201ccherrypicking\u201d science.\nOne of Winston\nChurchill\u2019s lesser\nknown quotations that science\nshould be \u201con tap but not on\ntop\u201d is as prevalent today as in\npost-war Britain. The sacking\nof Professor Nutt shows the\ngovernment dismissing scientific recommendation in favour\nof acting on public pressure. In\ndoing so, they undermine the\nvalue of science and are punishing a man for exercising his\nfreedom of speech.\nPerhaps where Professor Nutt\noverstepped the line with the\ngovernment is confusing \u2018evidence\u2019\n, which cannot be disputed with \u2018advice\u2019 which may be\nignored. Science is only one of\nmany factors which need to be\ntaken into account to give the\nfull picture; we cannot ignore\nsocial and political aspects.\nHowever, dismissing a man\nfor expressing views which conflict with the body he advises\nis outrageous. Whether Nutt is\nright to claim that alcohol and\ntobacco are more damaging\nthan LSD and ecstasy \u2013 and the\nresearch would suggest he is \u2013 is\nnot so much the issue as the expectation on scientists to deliver\nfacts without opinion.\nNutt\u2019s view that the government were giving mixed messages about the harm of drugs\nto the public is one of the main\nreasons Gordon Brown backed\nthe decision to sack the advisor\n\u2013 along with the opinion he was\nacting irresponsibly by downplaying the risks associated with\ncertain substances. Yet no one\ncan deny that the U-turn in cannabis classification is a prime example of such a mixed message.\nCannabis was reclassified back\nto class B largely due to public concern but also because of\nrise in the popularity of \u2018skunk\u2019.\n\u2018Skunk\u2019 typically contains three\ntimes the amount of tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) as cannabis\nresin in addition to a decreased\nconcentration of cannabidiol\n(CBD) \u2013 thought by some to reduce the effects of THC and so\nmake the drug less potent.\nThe drugs classification system in Britain is very subjective and is heavily dominated by\npublic opinion. From a purely\nmedical stand point mush-rooms, LSD and ecstasy should\nall be graded as class B at the\nvery most. Putting them in class\nA with heroin and other strong\nopiates merely serves to mock\nthe whole classification system.\nIn this country, we all have the\nright to free speech; scientists\nshould not be excluded from\nthis privilege.\nBrigette Atkins\nBrigette Atkins Science Editor\ntist should be removed for reporting\nsound scientific advice.\u201d\nShadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said Prof Nutt\u2019s sacking was \u201cinevitable\u201d after his \u201clatest ill-judged contribution to the debate\u201d.\nHowever, Liberal Democrat Home\nAffairs Spokesman Chris Huhne said\nsacking the advisor was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.\nHe continued: \u201cwhat is the point of\nhaving independent scientific advice if\nas soon as you get some advice that you\ndon\u2019t like, you sack the person who has\ngiven it to you?\u201d\nAccording to Mr Huhne, the government may as well have a \u201ccommittee of\ntabloid newspaper editors to advise on\ndrugs policy\u201d.\nFormer chief executive of the Medical Research Council and professor of\nneuroscience at Oxford University, Prof\nColin Blakemore, said that independent\nadvisors should be expected to voice\nconcerns if their advice is rejected.\n\u201cI worry that the dismissal of Prof\nNutt will discourage academic and\nclinical experts from offering their\nknowledge and time to help the government in the future,\u201d he said.\nEarlier this week two other senior\nscientific members of the ACMD re-signed. Marion Walker, clinical director of Berkshire Healthcare NHS\nFoundation Trust\u2019s substance misuse service and member of the Royal\nPharmaceutical Society, and Dr Les\nKing, part-time advisor to the Department of Health and senior chemist\non the ACMD both resigned over the\ntreatment of Prof Nutt. Dr King said,\n\u201cThere is an extremely angry feeling\namong most council members\u201d.\nOther senior scientific advisors to\nthe Home Office are \u201chorrified\u201d by the\nsacking of Prof Nutt and Mr Johnson\nfaces the prospect of \u201ccollective action\u201d\nover the affair. The government\u2019s chief\nscientific advisor, Professor John Beddington said, \u201cthe scientific evidence\n[on cannabis effects and harm] is absolutely clear cut. I would agree with it.\u201d\nProf Nutt has claimed to have the financial backing to set up a new council to investigate drugs if the current\nACMD disbands. As it stands, the\nCouncil is contravening its statutory\nrequirements, as there is no pharmacist on the board.\nProfessor David Nutt has been sacked as Chair of the ACMD for speaking out\n\n"

Affordable when you use an online deal.\nRestaurant Review: Sake No Hana\nA\nbroken set of escalators.\nNot exactly the sort of\nwelcome you\u2019d expect\nfrom Alan Yau\u2019s latest\nupscale Asian offering.\nAs you clunk your way up those stationary metal stairs strange thoughts\nmomentarily hover in your mind: \u2018Perhaps this is intentional? Are they making me work for my meal?\u2019 Such odd\nponderings quickly disappear when\nyou arrive at your desired destina-tion, whose high ceilings and modern\nJapanese wooden d\u00e9cor are a pleasure\nto the eye. New thoughts now enter,\nuttering \u2018Looks like tonight\u2019s going to\ncost me a bit.\u2019\nFortunately the last point wasn\u2019t too\nmuch of a worry for myself and a fellow\ndiner, for we had used a Toptable offer,\nthough this did mean we had to eat a\nlittle earlier than our appetites desired.\nAs one would expect from such a chic\nestablishment, a friendly waiter guided\nus promptly to a rather spacious yet\nlow-lying table and seating arrangement where we were instructed to\ntake off our shoes. I quite liked this little Japanese touch, not really because\nit made it seem more \u2018authentic\u2019, but\nrather because it made my feet feel that\nbit cosier.\nWith my feet made to feel at home\nmy eyes now turned to the menu.\nPretty comprehensive coverage of su-shi, sashimi and tempura was evident\nalongside some more inventive touches in the grilled and starters section.\nWith this restaurant review in mind I\nthought I should try to have a snippet\nof most areas.\nOverall, I guess the food was hit and\nmiss. Let\u2019s start with the misses. I\u2019ll\nbegin with our much loved friend, assorted tempura. Crispy the batter was,\nbut not as fluffy and fragrant as you\u2019d\nexpect from such a restaurant. And the\nprawns... Well, they weren\u2019t the giant\nones I was hoping for. Another slight\ndisappointment was the grilled yellow\ntail cheek with yuzu sauce. The combination of firm, fleshy fish with the\nslightly citrusy and bitter sauce should,\nin principle, have worked harmoniously together. But here the let down\nwas that the fish was ever so slightly\novercooked. Whilst these dishes were\ndecent shots on goal, you might expect\nthem to hit a tad closer to the target.\nHarsh critiquing you may think, but\n@ 23 St. James\u2019s Street, London, SW1A 1HA. Asian restauranteur Mr. Yau continues to impress at his latest\ninstalment, where Chris Sim carried out some investigative eating that didn\u2019t squeeze his wallet too much.\nremember how much you\u2019re dishing\nout for these delicacies.\nBut there were a few hits, and in my\nbook they were pretty big ones. Still\nhovering in my memory is the delightful dragon roll, whose glorious blend\nof sweet eel, juicy tempura prawn and\nwonderfully rich avocado was beautifully brought together with perfectly\ncooked rice and indulgent little eggs of\nflying fish, otherwise known as tobiko\ncaviar. Another dish which still makes\nme smile was an otherwise ordinary\nwatercress salad brought to life with\nthe presence of one of my favourite\nocean dwelling creatures, soft shell\ncrab. The slightly crispy outside of the\ncrab, combined with its unctuously\nJosh Pear\nJosh Pear\nsweet and fleshy centre, was married beautifully with light salad leaves\ndressed in slightly acidic overtones and\na light wasabi sauce. Dessert wasn\u2019t too\nbad either, a selection of ice creams\nand sorbets that let you leave with a\nhappily entertained palette. The acidic\nsweetness of blueberry sorbet cleansed\nmy palette between diving in for little\nmouthfuls of two classic Japanese ice\ncreams: the flavours of earthily sweet\nblack sesame and refreshing yet intense green tea.\nI must say I was pleasantly surprised\nby the portion size \u2013 prior to my arrival I had been fearing minute bites on\noversized plates. So to conclude, whilst\nthe food\u2019s consistency was akin to that\nof a mid-tabled Premiership football\nteam, I guess what you\u2019re really paying\nfor is top-notch ambience. The modern,\nclassyJapanesefa\u00e7ade,combinedwiththe\nspaciousness of the room and dim mood\nlighting, act in unison to create an atmosphere that can only really be described by\nthat fusion of two words, chillaxed.\nFood: 7.0\nValue: 6.5\nService: 8.5\nAmbience: 9\nOverall: 7.5/10\nIf like me you\u2019re a fresher, the above\ntitle might be slightly familiar. For\nmost, being a fresher means numerous nights of drinking and ready\nmeals. Of course I\u2019m with everyone\non that first part, but what about the\nready meals?\nI\u2019m guessing, but I think that at least\nhalf of us have had a good few nights\nwhere we simply can\u2019t be bothered,\nand would rather wait 5 minutes for\nthat glorious ping from the microwave.\nSo, picture this if you will. You\u2019ve had\nlectures all day and stop by at the supermarket on the way home. Option\na) is to go for numerous ingredients,\nwhich granted do cost a few quid more,\nto create your very own culinary mas-terpiece. Alternatively, you could go for\noption b) and get a few of those special\noffer tomato penne pasta ready meals.\nUnfortunately, for most it\u2019s been the\nlatter for at least once in fresherhood.\nSo, 6:30pm has rolled around and it\u2019s\nfeeding time. Into the empty kitchen to\nwatch a plastic dish spin in a white box\nfor 5 minutes, only to burn your mouth\non something which is stodgy and has\ngained its entire flavour from salt. And\nI\u2019m not joking about that last part, read\nthe label!\nI\u2019m not trying to nag like your\nmum. Instead, I\u2019m offering some\nfriendly advice, the reason being\nthat I was in that position in fresher\u2019s\nweek. Trust me, the alternative is so\nmuch better. I found this out when I\ndecided to invite some friends over,\nto see what they thought of my attempt at spaghetti bolognese. They\nbought the alcohol, and I got the\nfood. It was great, I made something\nwhich tasted good and I could enjoy in the company of friends. I\u2019ve\nadded the recipe at the bottom of\nthis page for you to try out. If you\u2019re\nstill thinking you really can\u2019t cook,\ndon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s hard to go wrong,\nyou just cook the mince and chuck\neverything into the pan.\nCooking for yourself means that\nyou will inevitably make way too much\nfood. It becomes an excuse to be sociable and to drag people out of their\nrooms to have some of your Thai green\nchicken curry. If you still haven\u2019t met\neveryone on your floor on the drinking\nnights, it\u2019s a good way to simply knock\non doors. So, it\u2019s now time to re-exam-ine the two scenarios. Option 1: Stab\nthe plastic lid, watch the dish for five\nminutes and eat alone. Option 2: Be\ncreative for a change and cook something which is very simple to make.\nGet friends round to get slightly drunk\nwhilst making it, and finally have a\ngood time.\nBest of all is that when you do make\ntoo much food, you can always freeze it\nand eat it tomorrow! Spaghetti Bolognese is the perfect example.\nThe recipe that I give is more than\nenough to feed four and still have\nenough left over to make a very simple\nlasagne tomorrow night.\nOk, bottom line is that you can pick\nwhichever option suits you best. Yes,\nthere are nights when you are in a complete rush because your 3000 word essay is due tomorrow and you\u2019ve only\nwritten 150 words. Despite this, on\nmost other occasions the experiences\nreally can be incomparable.\nHave a go, and enjoy it!\nRecipe for Spaghetti Bolognese\n(Student Style)\nServes: 4\nIngredients:\n1kg of lean minced beef (The more\nexpensive does actually equal nicer\nmince)\n2 x tbsp olive oil\n2 x 400g tins of chopped tomatoes\n1 x diced red onion\n2 x peeled and crushed garlic cloves\n(or 1 tsp garlic powder)\n2 x large glasses of red wine (A cheap\nbottle is fine)\n6 x tomatoes\n1 x 800g Spaghetti (Dried is ok, but\nfresh is much better)\n1 x 200g pack of button mushrooms\n1 x beef stock cube\n1 x tbsp tomato puree\n2 x tsp of mixed herbs (Dried is fine)\n2 x tsp oregano (Dried is fine)\nA small block of parmesan cheese to\ngrate over the top\nMethod:\nPut a little olive oil into a large saucepan and put on a high heat. Add all\nthe mince into the pan along with the\ndiced onions, and break up the mince\nwith a wooden spoon. Don\u2019t put the\ngarlic in yet as it burns. Once the onions have softened and browned,\nreduce the heat or the meat will turn\ngrey. Gently cook the mince for about\nten minutes and add a stock cube. Use\nthe wooden spoon to mix everything\ntogether. Add one large glass of red\nwine, along with the herbs if you want\nthem. Allow the red wine to reduce\nas it burns off the alcohol. Add both\ntins of chopped tomatoes and add the\nmushrooms (chopped in half). Also\nadd the garlic, the other glass of red\nwine, and the tomato puree. Stir well\nand allow everything to reduce down.\nAdd salt and pepper at this stage, but\ndo keep tasting as you go along! Simmer for a further 30 minutes or so.\nCook the spaghetti as instructed on\nthe pack and serve.\n\u201cOh yeah, I have to cook for myself now\u2026to the microwave!\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s not for the\nlack of trying, but more due to\nthe fact that week after week,\nwe here at felix have been \u201csnowed under\u201d with the opinions, thoughts, and\nbizarre ramblings of Imperial College\u2019s\nfinest most enthusiastic young writers.\nWhen I say enthusiastic I mean those\nwho put the effort in to writing a comment piece, then go through the whole\nordeal of emailing it to comment.fe-lix@imperial.ac.uk .\nNow after finally shoving enough\ncontributions into the seemingly nev-er-ending, well, we call it an \u2018Inbox\u2019, I\nhave selfishly claimed this space as my\nown. It\u2019s like playing king of the hill, but\nonly I get to cheat. Please keep sending your comment pieces in though, I\nwon\u2019t do this often. Anyway it appears\nI am the one rambling now.\nThis week I would like to tell you that\nlife is generally shit. Everything seems\nto be good, I\u2019ve made it to third year,\nI\u2019ve done well enough to stay on the\nfour year course, I have a beautiful girl-friend, great friends, a nice flat to live\nin and a job. What\u2019s more, I\u2019m turning\n21 in three weeks.\nOn paper, life is great!! In reality,\ntoo many tutorials, too many lectures\nand too much time in labs means that\nI have no time to spend with my girlfriend and friends. And to make it\nworse, everybody is in the same position \u2013 nobody has any time for each\nother, nobody wants to go out and\nparty anymore. Even when I decide to\nhave some time off and chill out for an\nevening, I have nobody to spend it with\n\u2013 even my flatmate is too busy and he\u2019s\njust a SAC monkey!!\nRemember when we were in first\nyear? We were all in halls, we could\nbe bothered to go out, there was no\nsuch thing as \u2018I\u2019ve got too much work\nto do\u2019 being an excuse for not heading\noff to Soho on a night out, or wasting\na day being drunk in the union. These\nwere good times, memorable times.\nHowever it seems these times are long\ngone, into the distance. I\u2019m not trying to tell you to enjoy your first year\nat university, you should know that\nalready. This rant is more like a pre\nwarning of how intense things get as\nyou progress through the years. More\nof your friends fail and drop out, some\ngo abroad, some graduate. It seems like\nyour social life is thinning by the sec-ond. Well that might be a slight exag-geration, but the point none the less is\nto make the best of what you have got.\nUnless you like working every second\nof the day this is a bad thing.\nIf you think about it, you\u2019re probably in a similar situation (first years\nexempt). When was the last time you\nmet loads of new people. Called them\nup for a night out, and acted like you\nwere a Fresher again? Exactly, you\u2019ve\nbeen in the same crowd for years\nnow and wouldn\u2019t it be nice to diver-sify? As good as it gets these days is\na house party, which are fun, but not\nthe same as living in halls, right? Hells\nno biatches! Get out of the hole you\u2019ve\ndug for yourselves and DO act like a\nFresher again. Go to Cheapskates on a\nwednesday, or Fabric in the early hours\nof the morning. Why do you need your\ncurrent friends to have fun? Make new\nones while you\u2019re there. \u2018The more\nthe merrier\u2019 I believe the saying goes.\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say here is don\u2019t let\nit get you down, keep doing whatever\nyou want to do, not what you\u2019re expected to do. You only die once.\nA\nlright, look, I know\nQuestion Time was a\nwhile back but I\u2019ve been\nin hospital with a hernia since I watched it,\nbecause I exploded with laughter so\nfrequently my internal organs began to\nvibrate at high frequency. I passed out\naround the time that David Dimbleby\npleaded to the audience that he \u201cdidn\u2019t\nwant the show to be about the BNP\u201d,\nas he sat next to the party\u2019s leader, a\nprominent black arts scholar, and three\ntossers looking to score cheap political\npoints. Thankfully my girlfriend was\naround to call an ambulance before I\nbled out to the sound of Nick Griffin\nfarting out another comment about\nthe Ice Age.\nSo cut me some slack, alright? It has\nbeen a hard week. I\u2019ve had to watch serious television for six hours a day to\nrecover from it all, and watching that\nmany episodes of The Wire will do anyone\u2019s head in. We all love depressing\ntelevision, guys, but if I wanted to slash\nmy wrists I\u2019d have spent the money on\nsomething sharper than a DVD case.\nNow, that means I wasn\u2019t around last\nweek to comfort you all while Abdul\nHannan declared that a new world order was partitioning society into \u201cthe\nwhite guys\u201d and \u201cdiffrunt people\u201d. But\nit\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here now, so let\u2019s start\nfrom the beginning \u2013 no-one is engineering anything in this country. The\nlast thing we engineered properly was\nthe Channel Tunnel, and even that has\nbeen set alight a few times. Nothing\nlarge-scale ever gets engineered in this\ncountry, because the system works.\nAnd by \u2018the system\u2019, I am of course talking about the fact that most people are\ntoo bloody stupid to pay attention to\nanything, racially charged or not.\nI know it can feel uncomfortable,\nsometimes, to see parties like the BNP\non television giving their spiel. And\nworse still, to hear people who are in\npower, people who are taken seriously,\nsaying other things that are similarly\nmisguided. But you have to understand\nthat this has happened before, and will\nhappen again, based on whichever social or ethnic group is currently in the\nfiring line. It\u2019s not pretty, but it does\npass.\nHow can we help? We can help by\nbeing the calm voices of reason. We\ncan help by not panicking. We can\nhelp by making jokes about Nick Griffin\u2019s entertainingly simple view of the\nhistory of this country. We are the\nyoung adults of this country, and we\nare scientists. We\u2019re supposed to be\nthe people who are speaking clearly,\ncutting through the bullshit and stating the facts. It would help everyone if\nwe took a step or two back, looked at\nhow ridiculous the situation really is,\nand then got involved again.\nNick Griffin is an arsehole. Everyone\nknows that, so don\u2019t panic if we\u2019re all\nnot down there with the anti-fascism\nprotesters. Some of us are just lazy,\nothers just can\u2019t think up witty enough\nslogans (not that that stops most people \u2013 the \u2018Dick\u2019 Griffin line was about as\nfunny as a BNP\u2019s after-dinner speech).\nEveryone knows. And as for the rest\nof the political parties \u2013 this is a stupid country. Not a racist one. So kick\nback, and enjoy the hilarity of watching\npeople get very, very worked up about\nall this. It\u2019ll all be over by Election Day.\nAngryGeekisalloverDickPrickNickGriffin\n\u201cNick Griffin is an\narsehole. Everyone\nknows that, so\ndon\u2019t panic if\nwe\u2019re all not\ndown there with\nthe anti-fascism\nprotesters.\u201d\nI don\u2019t look like this anymore.

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 06 NOVEMBER 2009\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk GAMES\nThe Versus Round - Left4Dead2 Demo\nIt might just be the demo, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Nick Virago and Jack Warren from feeling strongly about it\nA\nbloody marvel. It\u2019s a\nmarvel really, that such\na thing was possible. In\njust one short year we\u2019ve\nseen an engine overhaul,\nan AI redesign, community support\nand the small matter of five campaigns,\ndozens of new weapons, a new game\nmode and a gnome. A lot has been\nadded to Left4Dead2. It\u2019s the sort of\nupgrade that perhaps isn\u2019t breaking\nany new ground, but is surely cementing value as a world leader in fast, in-novative, iterative development.\nWhat did we need from a sequel, first\nand foremost? We needed new content\nfor one. So the new campaigns not only\nprovide more playing time than the\noriginal, but also firmly place the priority on unique experiences for each\ncampaign. The \u2018uncommon commons\u2019\nand melee weapons are special to each\nof the movies, sure, but what I\u2019m really talking about here are the variable\nweather effects on Hard Rain. How\nsome campaigns are cyclic paths while\nothers are about fighting through to an\nend point. How Hard Rain\u2019s sugar cane\nplantations attract a higher number\nof witches, whilst the daylight of The\nParish affects the zombie eyesight. It\u2019s\nabout providing new content, yes, but\nalso different content.\nSo you\u2019ve got your new content. But\nyou need the gameplay itself to move\nforwards too, right? So the AI infected\nhave learnt from human players\u2019 versus tactics, leading to a\nspeedier tank and more\ncautious smokers. The\nsurvivor AI hangs\nback with you now\ninstead of looking\nfor trouble, and\nis a little quicker on the uptake\nwhen things\nstart to turn\nsour (which\nthey will).\nSolid\nand\nimproved. That\u2019s what you need, and\nthat\u2019s what Left4Dead2 is. Everything\nthat characterises this gaming series is\nhere - the dry humour, the surreal pop\nculture references, the gleeful enjoyment of chaos. All this has been worked\non to be faster, fuller and contrasted.\nThe good bits stand out now,\nthey\u2019re pushed forwards and\nmade bigger and celebrated.\nKey moments, high points\nin games with your friends\nare recognised, celebrated,\nand given to you more fre-quently. The boring parts\nof the original are torn out\nand replaced with more\nexciting variants - gauntlet\nruns to stop closet camp-ing, spitters to keep you\nmoving. Jockeys to make\nyou giggle.\nBut this is Valve. So\nwhat do you get, on top\nof that? Well you get\nmore, don\u2019t you? Of\ncourse. So let\u2019s keep\nthe existing Survival\nand Versus modes, and\nlet\u2019s add Scavenger, a\nsuperb blend of the\naforementioned two\nmodes, and add that\nin for short bursts\nof competitive play.\nThen for\nthose who\nmostly play\ncampaign,\nthere\u2019s a Realism mode\nthat switches off glows,\nmakes special infected\nstronger, and\ngenerally\nemphasises\nteamwork.\nA\ngame\nthat\njust one\nyear ago was\nhitting shelves\nwith four campaigns and two\nversus is now a behemoth, with\na mode for everyone, swathes\nof new content and a vastly improved base game.\nIn a year. A year. How is that\nnot impressive? How can anyone\ncomplain about rushed releases\nof unfair money-grabbing? Even\nfrom the demo, it\u2019s clear just\nhow much has been added\nto what has already been\npicked as one of the best\n360 games around, and the\nfinest online game of 2009.\nA lot has been added. More than\nenough to ensure a repeat performance in 2010.\nWhen the demo comes online,\ndownload and remember \u2013 you\u2019ve\ngained a lot, and in just twelve months.\nValve has done it again, and all you\nneed to do to appreciate that is to keep\nthat sense of perspective in mind.\n\u201cIn a year.\nThat\u2019s impressive.\u201d\nOpinionated bastard?\nWrite for Versus - simply smash your\nkeyboard angrily in the\ngeneral direction of\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nS\nince this has been a hot potato for some time now,\nit\u2019s probably a good idea to\npoint out, early on, the fol-lowing: I enjoyed Left4Dead\nimmensely. I ridiculed the boycott of\nLeft4Dead2 and I still think it\u2019s a stupid idea. I was looking forward to this\ndemo very much. Which is a shame,\nbecause it\u2019s utterly terrible. And\nif this turns out to be representative of the game\nitself, I\u2019m going to sorely\nregret pre-ordering.\nWhere to start? Perhaps with the original\ngame itself. Left4Dead\nwas a great, great balance\nof maturity and humour,\nof a quietly depressing\ntone with light-hearted\nchuckles. I spent night after\nnight for a good few months\nafter release playing Versus,\nsoaking up every bit of the\nL4D canon, but it\u2019s all tied\ndown to a base of death,\ndepression and loneliness.\nBit too emo? Maybe. But\nLeft4Dead\u2019s atmosphere was\nright. The night, the concrete,\nthe emptiness. It all fitted\ntogether.\nLeft4Dead2 is\ngaudy, to say the\nleast. New Orleans\nis a bright, colourful and cheerful\nplace, I get that,\nbut that means\nyou have to ask\nyourself why it\u2019s\nthe setting for the\nsequel to such\na dark and rich\ngame. It\u2019s certainly a change,\nand maybe that\u2019s\nwhat Valve were\nseeking. But I\ncan\u2019t help but\nfeel it wasn\u2019t the\nright change to\nmake. It doesn\u2019t\nfeel like a sequel to Left4Dead. It\ndoesn\u2019t fit together.\nOkay, now we\u2019ve got the petty\nwhiny art shit out of the way,\nlet\u2019s get down to the details.\nValve make simple games. Pared\ndown. Refined. They make games\nwhere the rules fit on the back of\na matchbox yet actually becoming\nan expert at the game takes years.\nFive weapons. Four specials. That\u2019s\nit. Not so any more. Do you want\npistols or a melee weapon? Which\nmelee weapon? Do you want first\naid or a defibrilator? Automatic\nsniper rifle? Shotgun? Silenced\nweapons, for Christ\u2019s sake? And in\nthe distance, is that a spitter or a female boomer? Is that a witch? Or is\nthat a which? Or... too late.\n\u201cChoice\u201d is the watchword, and\nchoice has increased tenfold. But with\nthat choice comes an increase in complexity too, and a loss of the elegance\nthat made the game so good in the first\nplace. During the demo you\u2019ll switch\nbetween different shotgun types, pis-tols, back and forth from SMG to ri-fle, never really knowing which one is\nthe best or whether the silencer even\ndoes anything. This isn\u2019t how it was\nsupposed to be. This wasn\u2019t the code\nto which their other games were built,\nthis isn\u2019t the way of the company that\nrigorously tests every change and addition with a wide group of gamers. This\nisn\u2019t fitting together.\nSometimes it\u2019s not even that the embellishments made things worse. It\u2019s\nthat they just were utterly, emptily use-less. The gore is entirely over the top,\nfor one thing, and is so disconnected\nfrom the reality of the player\u2019s actions\nthat it becomes a rather unspectacular\nand bewildering sideshow, with zombies arbitrarily dissolving into red mist\nall around you. Wade in with melee\nand the screen becomes coated with\nred - all well and good for people who\nlike chuckling and high bodycounts,\nbut not so good for people who actually like to see the game they\u2019re playing.\nAll in all, Left4Dead2 feels unfin-ished. The team got together and\nlisted everything they wanted to add\nto a sequel. If they\u2019d taken only half of\nthose ideas through to the final game,\nit would\u2019ve been in far better shape. As\nit stands, it feels like a bad mod - too\nmuch added in without really refining\nwhat was there, what the vision was. We can\nonly hope the\ndemo is the\nweaker part\nof the game.\nToo late for\nme, though.\nNo refunds\nonline.\nJust...\nregrets...\n\u201cIt just\ndoesn\u2019t feel\nlike a sequel.\u201d\n\n"

Sadly, Professor Chomsky chose not to delve further into this\npoint on this occasion.\nOther efforts that could and are being made to aid the situation in the\nregion, or rather to subdue Israel, include BDS. Initiated in July 2005, BDS\nis an international economic campaign\nto boycott Israeli goods, supported by\nthe PSC, Palestinian Solidarity Campaign. There are a number of points to\nthis campaign: recognise the rights of\nArab-Palestinians to full equality, the\nright of Palestinian refugees to return\nand to end Israel\u2019s occupation of all\nArab lands.\nThe boycotting extended to that of\nan academic boycott: refusal to interact with Israeli universities, in particular those situated in the West Bank as\nthey are seen as being involved with\nthe occupation of Palestinian territories and against UN resolutions. This\nis, however, controversial and discussions are taking place with a view to\nboycotting institutions while maintaining dialogue with individuals.\nOther boycott examples include:\nsome UK churches have withdrawn\ncorporate investment from Israel; urging people to boycott new Intel processors manufactured in Israel; divesting\nin companies that specifically benefit\nIsrael \u2013 drawing comparisons with the\nSouth African Apartheid in which similar divestment took place. A campaign\nof cultural, academic and sporting\nboycotting is being encouraged.\nMoreover, the instigation of sanctions would result in increased pressure on the economy which could\ncause Israel to implement international law to give rights to the Palestinian\npeople.\nThe point of South African Apartheid was further elaborated upon by\nChomsky: a comparison was made\nbetween the modern-day situation in\nPalestine and Apartheid South Africa.\nMoshe Dayan, the Israeli military and\npolitical leader, said in 1967 Palestinians will \u201ccontinue to live like dogs, and\nwhoever wishes may leave.\u201d A quote\nChomsky brought up many times.\nIn South Africa, he points out, the\nApartheid regime had to look after the\nblack workers, to some extent at least,\nas they relied on them for labour. The\ncase was similar with Israel\u2019s attitude\nto the Palestinians in the \u201860s, however\nnow with immigrants from other poor\nparts of the world now available to carry out the undesirable work, the Israeli\nattitude, Chomky alleges, is now much\nmore in line with Dayan\u2019s sentiments.\nOne question posed to Chomsky\nby a Palestinian student, enquired\nabout the right of return for Palestinian refugees. UN Resolution 194 states\n\u201cthat the refugees wishing to return\nto their homes and live at peace with\ntheir neighbors should be permitted to\ndo so at the earliest practicable date\u201d.\nHowever, as this is a General Assembly\nagreement, it is not binding by international law and as such no repatriation\nhas taken place.\nMoreover, the wording of the agreement is subject to interpretation as the\nrefugees in question could encompass\nArab-Palestinians and Jews that fled\npersecution; where the Arab-Palestinians may be deemed non-peaceful due\nto their involvement in the start of the\nIsraeli War of Independence in 1948-49. This would eliminate their right of\nreturn based on the assumption that\nthey would not \u201clive at peace\u201d.\nAnother point mentioned was\nwhether any such agreement would\ninclude only those who are first-gen-eration refugees or whether it would\nentitle descendents of the original refugees to the right of return, of which\nthe matter is unresolved. The original\nnumber of displaced Palestinians was\napproximately 750 000 and if the descendents of refugees were granted the\nright of return this would lead to a possible influx of around four million peo-ple. Yasser Arafat (2002) highlighted\nthat if very large numbers of refugees\nwere to return to Israel, it would be inconsistent with Israel remaining a state\nwith a Jewish majority.\nProfessor Chomsky is admired even\nby most of his academic adversaries for\nhis exemplary intellectual honesty and\nintegrity. This made his frequent use of\nquotes from highly dubious sources as\nthough they were universally respected\nexperts particularly disappointing.\nAkin to this were various comparisons he made that were clearly aimed\nat the emotional rather than rational\nside of the debate. On the similarities\nbetween Zionism and Apartheid he\nmade a considerable effort to justify\nhis position. On his linking of Israelis\nto capitalists and Palestinians to socialists he did not.\nHe went so far as to argue that working for a fixed income was worse\nthan being a slave and suggested that\nthis was analogous to the plight of\nPalestinians.\nOverall the main point to take away\nfrom the talk was that Israel won\u2019t\nchange its policy towards Palestine so\nlong as it is supported by the US and\nthe EU and the situation won\u2019t improve\nuntil Israel changes its policy.\nWriter and activist Gilbert Achcar introducing the topic to be discussed and the speakers, Tariq Ali and Noam Chomsky.\nStart here.\nGet there faster.\nOliver Wyman is a leading global management consultancy.
