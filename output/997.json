    "content": "2 News\nToasted Sandwich Shop\nThe Sandwich Shop on Gloucester Road, damaged by fire last weekend\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nThe Sandwich Shop on Gloucester\nRoad was closed at the start of this\nweek causing great distress to many\nof the students of Imperial College.\nA fire broke out on the premises\non Sunday night, causing significant damage. It was thought to have\nbeen started by an electrical fault.\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nA new ethanol fermentation process\ndeveloped at Imperial College may\nmake it possible to turn waste straw\ninto 'biofuel', with major implications for renewable energy sources\nin the future.\nAgricultural waste is a major\nproblem for farmers, particularly in\nthe EC where burning straw is ille-gal. The straw can be converted into\npaper pulp, but this is uneconomical\nsince it produces highly polluting\nwaste products.\nOne solution would be to ferment these waste products into\nethanol, which could then be used\nA sales assistant, who was inside\nthe shop when the fire broke out,\nraised the alarm. He ran across the\nroad to the Harrington Arms Pub to\nalert the fire brigade and a fire\nengine was at the scene in a matter\nof minutes.\nMuch of the damage caused was\nsuperficial and the shop manager\ndeclared that the Sandwich Shop\nas a renewable fuel for cars.\nHowever, conventional yeasts cannot affect such crude mixtures of\nfarm waste.\nResearchers at Imperial College's Centre for Biotechnology have\nfound a way to convert the mixtures\ninto ethanol both quickly and efficiently. The process depends on\nmetabolically and genetically engineered bacteria, similar to the kind\nfound on garden compost heaps.\nBiofuels such as ethanol are\nalready used in countries like Brazil\nand the United States but, until\nnow, such projects have not been\neconomically viable. The new technique should cut the cost of ethanol\nwould be trading as normal \"as of\nFriday morning\".\nThe shop, which sells it's sandwiches at half price after 4pm, is\nused by many students. With the\nre-opening comes a special offer\navailable to all Imperial College\nstudents. Sandwiches will be half\nprice all day for the next two weeks.\nproduction considerably.\nDr Namdar Baghaei-Yazdi, who\nrecently won an important\nEuropean award for his work on the\nproject, says: \"This process could\nrevolution is e the energy and fuel\nindustry as there are mountains of\nagricultural and industrial wastes\nthat are potential feedstocks for our\nprocess.\"\nThe process is being adapted for\ncommercial use by a biotechnology\ncompany called Agrol. \"Hopefully\nwe will have the first pilot plant\noperating within three to four\nyears,\" says Dr Baghaei-Yazdi.\nUnion\nMatters\nThe Imperial College Union\nHandbook Editor has resigned. The\nUnion Office Sabbaticals and the\nEvents & Marketing Manager are\ncurrently dealing with the pressing\nmatters to do with the publication.\nA new Editor is currently being\nsought and anyone interested\nshould speak to Andy Wensley,\nICU President. The job would\ninvolve some work during the rest\nof this term and the remainder of\nthe work being done over the summer vacation (for which a nominal\nsalary is paid).\nThe Jazz & Rock practice room\nhas now been closed following\ncomplaints from residents of Beit\nHall {Felix 986). Plans were discussed at the Executive Committee\nmeeting last Tuesday to transfer\nRag and the Operatic Society to\ndifferent premises and use these\nrooms for Jazz and Rock Club.\nThe next Union General\nMeeting is to be held on Friday\n20th May at 1pm. HaagenDazs\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nCrowds of people were seen queuing outside the new Haagen-Dazs\nice cream parlour on Bank Holiday\nMonday awaiting its first full day\nof trading.\nThe shop on Gloucester Road\nopened up for a trial run on Sunday\nevening for a few hours. The shop's manager said that trade has been\n\"pretty good\" so far with lots of\ntourists during the day and mainly\nyoung people during the evening.\nThe official opening was yesterday and free samples were being\ngiven out from a cart outside the\nshop. Two girls could be seen\nroller-skating down Gloucester\nRoad and Old Brompton Road\ngiving out coupons which offered\n'two scoops for the price of one'. A jazz band entertained the customers\nin the evening.\nThe parlour is open seven days a week from 9am to 11pm, and prices\nstart from \u00a31.20.\nFuture Fuel From Farm Waste\nTwo more recipes from the Cookery Corner are on page 19\n\n"

    "content": "18 Opinion\nEditorial\nFree Press.\nThe letter below suggests that views condoning\nmurder have no place in the free press. The\nexpression 'free press' to me implies that there\nare no restrictions (other than legal ones) on\nwhat views are held by contributors.\nOne of the aims of Felix is to give people a platform on which to air their views. The only\nreason why I would not publish such a letter\nwould be if it was anonymous. I do not see that\nFelix should allow people to express their views\nwithout having the guts to put their names to\nthem.\nWhat's the point in a letters page if I turn\naround to people and say: \"Oh, sorry, I can't let\nyou express that opinion because it might offend\nsomeone.\" By their nature, opinions are going to\nbe disagreed with by people. If someone is\nwilling to put their views on the line and express\nthem through Felix, then all well and good. At\nleast it's sparking off a debate, which is\nSMALL ADS From now on, could\nanything submitted to\nFELiX be supplied\non PC disks.\nIf you would like to\nhelp type up articles\nand gain experience\nof Desktop Publishing,\ndrop into the FELiX\nOffice any time.\nMurder Was\nCondoned?\nDear Beccy,\nI was disturbed to see the letter of Yassar\nHatami published in last week's Felix. In this\nletter the opinion that \"it is unjust to see Salman\nRushdie in hiding\" is attacked, on the grounds\nof the insulting nature of the book 'The Satanic\nVerses'. In doing this it is clearly implied that\nthe current terrorism directed against Mr Rushdie is justified.\nWhilst I expect some people to hold this\nview I do not expect to see them in print in\nFelix. Expressions of views condoning murder\nought to have no place in the free press. I hope\nthat the letters publication was just a slip.\nYours faithfully,\nRobert Munro\nChem 3\nsomething that people claim has been lacking in\nFelix in the past.\nSetting An Example?\nSo, what has our President been up to? Drinking\ntoo much whisky and then trashing IC Radio by\nthe sounds of it. He sat in a corner and pulled\nrecord sleeves over himself from the shelves\nabove, as well as throwing a chair about and he\ntore a cardboard box into shreds (or so it has\nbeen claimed!). Very responsible behaviour for\none of the highest ranking people in the Union...\nEditors Wanted\nDon't forget that, as well as the need for a new\nHandbook Editor, the Union still needs an\nAlternative Prospectus Editor. If you are\ninterested in pointing out all the faults of\nImperial College to prospective students, contact\nGreg lies, c/o Pub Board Exec Pigeonholes,\nUnion Office.\nHandbook Editor Wanted\nYou have to gather the material,\nobtain advertising, chase clubs for\nsubmissions. You are responsible for\nthe creation of the Handbook: how it\nlooks and what it contains.\nBut don't panic! Whilst it may\nseem a big job, there are plenty of\npeople around to give you advice and\nassistance. And don't forget that the\nwork have to do over the summer is\npaid.\nSounds interesting?

    "content": "16 Reviews\nPresident Garfield's American Scream\n\"Iron will, iron hand, neck like a tyre, iron man, iron bar, metal band,\npumping iron man.\" So said Juliana Hatfield of the one-time Henry Garfield.\nTo the world he is now Henry Rollins, ex-leader of the seminal hardcore\nband, turned book publisher and raconteur, Tintin braces his hatches...\nWaiting in a BMG conference room with a ragged group of journalists, my first experience\nof Rollins is as I go out to get a coke. On the\nother side of the door is a surprisingly small, if\nrather broad, figure. Even with his multiple\ntattoos and close cropped hair, it's an anticlimax.\nI expected him to be something more than just\nover-sized normality. When talking he seems to\nbe slightly ill at ease, which is weird because he\nhas spent the last year doing his 'Spoken Word'\nshows and that was in front of thousands. There\nhe was in one of his element by all accounts,\nbut maybe that was real life and this is\nbanal promotion, which is the\nmusician's bane. Yet 90\nminutes later he is still\ngoing on strong,\nanswering even the\nboring questions, and\nmaking them worth-while.\nArticulate, funny\nand very aware,\nRollins is holding the\ndying pulse of urban\nAmerica. He has\nsomething to say and\ndo. Open up to\nreality.\n\"It's heading\ntowards a cross-roads. It's gonna get\nso bad that some-thing's gonna have\nto give and I think\nbefore it goes all the\nway down the\ntubes...it's gonna\ntake a lot of dead\npeople for everyone\nto go: 'What are we\ndoing with these guns?'\nI think heterosexual people are\ngoing to have to start getting AIDS and\ndying...Barbra Streisand's gonna have to die\nand then the Government will go: 'We have a cure for AIDS' because there'll be enough rich\npeople who can afford to pay Du Pont out the\nbutt to buy the medication. I'm sure the cure is\nsitting somewhere right now, they're just\nwaiting for enough people to have the money to\nbuy it and right now it's all those undesirable\ntypes like junkies and gay people who can't pay,\nso Lilly or Du Pont can't make the money yet.\nSo I think you're gonna see a lot more\nhorrific sh*t before there's any signs where you\nsitting here [in Britain] can see on the news\nthings are getting better, but 24 hours a day,\n95% of the American population is really\ncool...all you need is 5%, the asshole 5% factor\nBarbra Streisand's gonna have to die\nand you got a nation paranoid. And I think the\nGovernment helps reinforce stereotypes like:\n'blackman bad, whiteman good, cop good,\nRodney King bad. You know if a cop\nbeats the sh*t out of someone, six\nweeks in jail. If a bunch of black\nguys beat up a be 'bye-bye'\nSan Quentin in\nlike...they'd be inside a block of ice with Sylvester\nStallone like 'Demolition Man'...it would have\nbeen a different story, everybody knows it, so I think things are gonna get really hairy. There's gonna be some real atrocities before it gets\nbetter. America just doesn't look at its backyard,\nthat's the problem. It's too busy fronting the\ncool thing - ' We'll help you little starving\nnation'. Man, you ought to go to America, walk\nthrough New York, see every other person has a paper cup, jiggling quarters like 'hey man I'm starving' every other person and you're like 'I got no more money' and they'll follow you.\n'Hey man, I know you got some money'.\nThey're desperate, they're f** king starving. You\ngot Vietnam Veterans who can't get any health\ncare; it's crazy. And at the same time there's Michael Jackson, $60 million; Madonna, $60\nmillion. Ten kilometres down\nthe highway from where she\nlives it looks like Lebanon on\na bad day. Compton is\nunbelievable. It looks like a scene from 'Blade Runner'\nThere's a death count up\nevery Sunday, a weekend\ngoes by and there's like...\nTeenagers, these kids don't even shave, they can't even\ndrive but they can shoot.\nThey can't read but they can\nshoot.\"\nThat was straight off,\nalmost without a breath,\nfrom the question: \"Would\nyou say America is heading\ntowards self destruction?\"\nIf anyone is wrestling\nwith the demons of the\nUnited States of America,\nit's the boy who got beaten\nup at school in 1968, for\n\"killing Martin Luther\nKing\"( ie being white).\nAnd that is why he is\nimportant, because he\ndemonstrates that there is a way out of the ghetto which\nisn'ta wooden box. When\nhe talks about the young black\nmale being a hunted person he\ntalks the same language as Ice-T and\nIce-Cube. Except then he goes on to\nreject the use of firearms.\nThat Henry Rollins isn't head of some white\nsup re mist terror machine is amazing. That he is\none of the most focussed, dedicated human\nbeing on the planet is not short of unique.\nPresident Garfield? Just tell me where to put the\ncross.\nFreedom? You can't handle freedom, you're dying for it\n\n"

It\nnow seems fashionable for any relative over the\nage of fifty to lose 'the plot'. What an excellent\nphrase that is. I wonder if you really do lose some\nplot of land somewhere. Now that would mean\nthat my family has, by now, forsaken a land mass\nroughly equivalent to Alaska.\nNot content with letting the oldies have all\nthe fun, my sister has got in on the act. She is on\nthe verge of a nervous breakdown. She couldn't even have the dec en ce to do something original\nlike...well I don't know...if I suggest something\nit wouldn't be original. I suppose that's a kind of\nparadox. Some action is only original if it has\nnever been done. Thus an action performed is\nimmediately no longer original. So, nothing is\nindeed original any more. Well I guess you can't blame people for trying.\nMy insanity is a direct result of living for too\nlong. I think I 've actually lived, drunk from the\ncup of life and showered in the bathroom of\nexperience. But do not be envious. The problem\nwith absorbing life, like I claim to have done, is\nthat your mind is only a finite storage device, so\nif you increase the amount of data accepted per\nunit time without first increasing the size of the\nstorage device it will fill up as a function of the\ndegree of absorption. My advice to all of you is\nto cease taking in all but the knowledge you\nconsider to be absolutely vital. Forget\neverything you learnt at school and concentrate\non the important things in life.\nBut what is important? Remember to feed the\ncat. But what was my cat's name? 'Cat' is a good functional name. I only have one cat, so\nthe name is unique. But will my flat mates object\nto me referring to them by appearance and not\nby anything more personal? \"Good morning,\nlong-haired veterinary student, would you like a cup of tea?\" There, that seems mannerly enough.\nBut do I need to remember what subject they\ndo? Does the person change? I think not. So,\neverything will be judged by physical\nappearance and not by role or actions, this will\nbecome my creed.

His second and\nthird string quartets are newly released on Argo,\nplayed by the Balanescu Quartet. His music is\nhauntingly evocative; the title of the second\nquartet, Hunting : Gathering, is all you need to\nknow for its dry, padding ostinati and spectral\nsnatches of melody to begin to work on your\nimagination. The third quartet is titled The\nSonglines after Bruce Chatwin's novel of the\nsame name, and its 18 minute central movement\nis perhaps an overindulgence. But the finale,\nwith its carefree 'whistling' violin tune, is a Michael Nyman (Photo: Decca/Nigel Parry)\ngood place to sample a different\nand exciting disc.\nA long way from Volans' ascetic\nVeldtschmerz is the plush\nupholstery of Michael Nyman's The Piano Concerto, also on Argo.\nMade up of four tableaux culled\nfrom the soundtrack of Jane\nCampion's The Piano, this is\nunashamed aural debauchery.\nStudio-tweaked balance in the\nopening scene, 'The Beach', has the\nstrings lighting up the horizon like a tropical sunset while a gurgling\nbass clarinet washes round your\nankles. You could also try the lush\ntune at the beginning of\ntrack two, or the irresistibly\nfoot-tapping first section of\nthe coupling, Musique a Grande Vitesse (the rest\nisn't as good, but it's untroubled by the\nslightly murky bass that affects The\nPiano Concerto).\nThe Philip Glass Violin Concerto,\nrecently released by Deutsche\nGrammophon, is more explicitly\nminimalist. Glass does his own thang\nwith a conventional orchestra (insofar\nas the Vienna Philharmonic is such):\noscillating accompaniments, hypnotically repetitive cadences, and soloist\nGidon Kremer pre sti digit a ting his way\nseamless ly up and down the keyboard.\nBest is the rich central passacaglia -chaconne a son gout, you might say.\nThe coupling, Schnittke's Concerto\nGrosso No. 5, is much spikier.\nRobin Holloway's Second Concerto\nfor Orchestra, new on a half-price, half-Alexander Balanescu: his quartet play Volans on Argo (Photo:\nTansi Spinks)\nlength disc from NM C, requires much more\nconcentration than Nyman or Glass, but the\neffort is worth it - try the 20 seconds following\n4'52\" in track one. There are touches of pastiche\n(the opening strongly suggests Debussy) and at\nleast one quote: hints dropped at various points\nturn into 'Morning has broken' at the end. The\nbooklet implies there are others, and the risk\nHolloway runs here is that people will suspect\nthat the bits they like best are not by him at all.\nMore music-theatre than opera, MarkAnthony Turnage's Greek is a third new Argo\nrelease. The text is Steven Berkoff s version of\nOedipus Rex, set in a plague-ridden, riot-torn\nmodern London. The music is variable but\noccasionally brilliant, culminating in an\nextraordinary funeral march for Cockney\npatricide Eddy (track 28).\nPatrick Wood\nBerio: Renderings\nOf the three concerts in the first week of the\nSouth Bank Centre's Berio festival, the intimate\nHomage a Cathy in the Purcell Room was by far\nthe most enjoyable.\nBorn in 1925, Berio's output ranges from\nexperimental (read 'unpleasant') electronic\nmusic, through to arrangements of Lennon and\nMcCartney. Both these extremes were\nrepresented in last week's tribute to his first\nwife, the late virtuoso singer Cathy Berberian.\nShe featured on the tape piece Visage which\nclosed the first half of the concert: the musicians\ntook cover and the hall was filled with what\nsounded like a woman dying horribly in a snake\npit. Snuff audio meets Pierrot Lunaire without\nthe vowels.\nPreviously we had heard the early, lyrical\nsetting of El Mar la Mar for two altos and a small but colourful ensemble, and there was\nmore of the same at the end in Folk Songs. In\nbetween, mezzo Luisa Castellani draped herself\nover the baby grand and began to sing John\nCage's The Wonderful Widow of 18 Springs. It\nseems a bit normal for Cage, until the pianist\nbegins to play - a muffled percussive\naccompaniment on the lid that remains down\nover the keyboard.\nLess rewarding than Berio's chamber music\nwere the large-scale works, such as the\ngimmicky Formazioni which the London\nPhilharmonic Orchestra played to open the\nfestival. Incidentally, it's a long time since I 've\nseen an LPO programme booklet, and they seem\nto have succumbed to the Hello! tendency. A column headed 'Philharmonic News' informs us\nthat lead violinist Joakim Svenheden has a taste\nfor good wine and food and enjoys windsurfing.\nIt can only be a matter of time before Franz\nWelser-Most invites us into his Jacuzzi.\nPatrick Wood\nThe Berio festival continues at the South Bank\n(box office 071 928 8800) on the 7th,10 th May\n(Requies, followed by Mahler's Second\nSymphony), 12th and 14th May (the opera La\nVera Storia).\nComing soon: a review of ENO's new Cos)\n\n"

Namely that Far and Away was not a good\nrepresentation of his ability and that Backdraft\nwas. The result is a disastrously directed frenzy\nof activity.\nHenry Hackett (Michael Keaton) is a reporter\nfor the New York Sun, a tabloid newspaper and,\nlikewise, his wife who is presently on maternity\nleave. The film is a day-in-the-life of Hackett\nwho, on this particular day, has a job interview at\na rival newspaper while having to contend with\nhis daily job as a sub-editor.\nAt his job interview, Hackett poaches some\ninformation from the rival newspaper which\nmight vindicate two youths who are under\nsuspicion of murder. However, as every Felix\nreporter knows, a story cannot be printed without\nhard evidence and nobody seems to want to\nsqueal. Come the deadline, Hackett still has not\ngot his scoop and the Sun is forced to go to press\nwith a story condemning the two youths. It's over....or is it?\nThe film also dabbles into the private and\nworking lives of some of the other reporters at\nHenry (Michael Keaton) tries to pacify his wife Martha (Marisa Tomei)\nthe Sun played most notably by Robert Duval\nand Glenn Close.\nKeaton's worst mistake was having anything\nto do with this film, but his performance did\nkeep me awake and both of his expressions (the\ndouble eyebrow take-down and the single\neyebrow slant) are put to good effect at regular\nintervals.\nThe directing is in Ron Howard's shaky-camera style which I assume is to emphasise the\nchaotic atmosphere of a newsroom, but it made\nme feel que e zy.

What lets it down\nis the casting of Dafoe as Tom. He lantern-jaws\nabout in his thick glasses, looks at things and\npretends to write. Strangely, this works perfectly\nin the film's moments of wry comedy.\nI'd recommend this film because it does have\nsome genuinely moving moments.

Although he is married to\nthe smart (and rather attractive) Annabella\nSciorra, Jack is having an affair with the\nsubmissive and waif-like bimbo, Juliette Lewis.\nThe personal and professional strands of\nJack's life entwine themselves when he's assigned to the task, by both of his bosses, of\nnabbing Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov.\nMona is played by sex-personified Lena Olin, to\nwhom Jack has a fatal attraction.\nAs the story twists and turns, Jack becomes\nincreasingly desperate while the other characters\nbecome increasingly ruthless.\nThe movie's plot is really rather perfunctory\nand it is little more than the window-dressing\nfor an unusual concoction of noir-throwback and\nblack comedy.\nThe noir references are certainly there (the\nmanipulative, scheming woman, a rendezvous at\nan office, the innocent cop in the corrupt city),\nbut rather like Chinatown, updated for the 90s( he's not so innocent). The black comedy\nmeanwhile is certainly black, but not that\ncomedic (rather like toning Prizzis Honor down\na bit).\nThe film's primary strength is its sheer style;\nit's blocked, shot, edited and scored very well\nindeed, while the performances (in particular\nOlin's and Oldman's) are rivetting.\nRomeo Is Bleeding is the most original blend\nof old ideas since The Piano and nearly as good\ntoo.

The videos were\njudged by a panel of industry experts who\nexamined both technical and artistic content.\nOther awards were given to Glasgow for their\nmusic videos, Bath for news and graphics and\nExeter for light entertainment.\nThe winning drama entry called 'As Seen On\nTV, is a warning about the perils of watching\ntoo much television. This was just one of the\ndrama entries from Imperial College this year. It\nwas written and directed by Ronjoy Choudhury,\na third year physics student who intends to enter\nthe film industry.\nThe special programme on money was a comic animation based on the not-so-democratic\nlives of some old STOIC amplifiers. This was\nmade by Andy Clark from Electrical\nEngineering using just a simple camera and\nrecorder. He plans to build a more sophisticated\ncontroller to speed the animation process.\nImperial's music video, made by the Dance\nClub, was based on a gangster movie set to\nmusic. This was beaten to the award by the\nGlasgow student television who produced some\nexcellent pop videos of a local band called 'The\nStanleys'.\nThese programmes will be shown later this\nterm on Imperial College's own internal\ntelevision network, along with films produced at\nKings College and UCL.\nSabbaticals\nFed up with exams/work already?

In the evening Rag\nis holding its annual dinner in the Union Dining\nHall. Anyone is welcome to come and it only\ncosts \u00a37.50 (including wine), so it is a bargain\nnot to be missed. If you would like to go to the\ndinner then see us in the Rag Office or at next\nweek's Rag meeting.\nAnother event that is happening is a Rag\nRaid to Oxford on Saturday 21st May. There we\nwill be collecting for Oxfam. So if you fancy a The National Student Television Association\nis run collectively by student television stations\naround the country and allows ideas and\nprogrammes to be distributed around the\ncampuses.

Here are some past slogans to\nhelp you along: Off Your Tree '93, Bug-A Ewe\n'92, Elephants Come '91 and Dragons Divine\n'89-1 think you get the idea.\nAs a final note, thank you to all those who\ncollected for Turning Point at the Deacon Blue\nconcert at the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday of\nlast week. Your totals should be available soon\nand I hope you had a good time.\nWatery\nFun In\nPenzance\nOn Wednesday 30th March, five souls (who'd much rather be in their beds at this time of the\nmorning, thank you very much) set off for a week of watery fun in Penzance, Cornwall. I wouldn't say that the trip was long but when we\ngot out of the minibus the sound of clicking\nbacks could be heard for several miles.\nWe knew it was going to be a windy week\nbut when we got down to Marazion beach, the\nfirst thought was: \"What's the smallest sail\nwe've got?\" This was closely followed by: \"Can\nwe make it any smaller?\" Some of us eventually\nmanaged to get out on the water, but for the less\naccomplished sailors, the day was the first of\nmany sitting in the front of the van laughing at\nall the wipe- outs and trying to add up the total\ncost of all the broken kit.\nOur trip coincided with a BFA event on the\nsame beach and it made us feel good when we\nsaw that professional sailors can't stop their\nsails from flying down the beach, usually hitting\nseveral people on the head as they went. Along\nwith the very strong winds throughout the week,\nthe waves were massive, sometimes reaching\nthe same height as the sails, which is about five\nmetres. Several people got caught in the shore\nbreak, resulting in more broken kit to the sound\nof huge cheers from the others on the beach.\nIn the evenings we returned to our flat that\nwe were sharing with the seven ex-IC sailors\nwho had met us down there. After a quick meal,\nwe somehow managed to spend the rest of the\nevening in the bar below the flat (less staggering\ndistance) and by the end of the week we had\nbecome quite adept at the table football, that is,\nwhen we weren't distracted by the local points\nof interest!\nOn Monday, our last day spent there, we\ndecided to try a bit of surfing and drove to a local beach that was a bit less crowded. For\nsome reason, though, two of our group didn't get changed. I am sure it had nothing to do with\nthe size of the waves (huge) or the changing\narea (in a car park in the rain). Three of us did\nbrave the elements and, after a nice easy walk\ndown to the beach, we hit the waves, or rather,\nthey hit us. But, enough about that. We stayed\nout until we had enough of a taste of the sea\nwater and then spent the next few minutes trying\nto climb up a wet, slippery cliff while carrying\nsurf boards. Following a quick change au\nnaturel, we went back.\nOn Tuesday morning we packed up the bus\nfor the last time and set off for home and, after\nanother short, comfortable journey, we were\nback in lovely London and Penzance could\nrelax, until next year...\nThe 3D15 x15x15 crossword winners are on pages 8 and 9\n\n"

    "content": "14 Reviews\nPicassoLife and Art\nby Pierre Daix\nPablo Picasso spanned the Twentieth Century,\nthe most important painter and sculptor of our\ntime and maybe of all time. He made and tired\nof styles: Cubism, Surrealism, Papier Colles,\nPrimitivism; he was a player throughout. His\ncircle of friends also included some of the most\nnotable names of the European artistic ruling\nclass: Matisse, Pignon, Breton, Stein and\nToklas. In both life and art he excelled and\nwalked tall.\nPierre Daix knew Picasso as a friend and\ncritic for the last 25 years of his life and he\nproduces what may become a standard, if flawed, book. Translated from the original\nFrench, Picasso - Life and Art is stuffed,\noverstuffed, with details, especially titles of\nsome of the 2,000 paintings and 1,300 sculptures\nwhich he accomplished. On occasion, whole\npages are wreathed in meaningless italics which\nchoke the flow of living. But with judicious\nskipping, it is not too tricky for the casual\nreader.\nBiographical details are treated with obvious\n:\nis by Orson Scott Card\nOrson Scott Card is an incredibly talented\nwriter, with a knack of creating brilliantly\nrealised alien worlds as backdrops for very\nhuman dramas. He's won just about every sci-fi\naward going and, no matter how strange the\nsituations he writes about, the ideas Card\nexplores are particularly relevant today.\nWhich is why I was so disappointed with The\nCall to Earth. It's the second volume of the\nHomecoming series, set on a world that was\ncolonised from Earth millennia ago. On arriving\nat their new home, the colonists destroy all\ntechnology which could be used for large scale\nwarfare, creating a supercomputer with the\npower to influence human minds to ensure the\narts of war are never rediscovered.\nFor thousands of years, the world lives up to\nits name of Harmony. But then the computer,\nwhich is now worshiped as a goddess called the\nOversoul, starts to break down and the only\nplace it can be repaired is Earth. A family in the\npeaceful city of Basilica are chosen as the\ncomputer's agents on Harmony, with the\nyoungest son, Nafia, becoming a prophet for the\ncomputer. But many powerful enemies are\nranged against Nafia and his family. And do\nrespect, both in the sense that Daix was a friend\nand also because much has been said already.\nPicasso was certainly never in need of a muse,\nhe picked and chose as he wanted. Yet as\nFernande, Eva, Olga, Marie-Ther&se, Dora,\nFrancoise and Jacqueline, amongst others, came\nto realise, Picasso's speed of work did somewhat\nlimit his season of affection. When it was time to\nbe on with the new, the obsolete was quickly\ndropped. Such is the respect of Daix for Picasso,\nthough, that the most critical he gets over this\nstate of affairs is a defer ent tug of the forelock to\nPicasso's statement that sexual contacts should\nnot \"complicate his existence\". This is one of\nDaix's problems as he occasionally verges on\nthey want to follow the alien and unfathomable\ncommands of the Oversoul anyway?\nThe premise of the series simply doesn't hold\nwater, either on a scientific or a human level.\nThe character is ation usually one of Card's strong points - is lacklustre and one-dimensional, perhaps because there are too\nmany characters to do any of them justice. The\nplot is confused and messy; the computer's mind-altering ability is used as an easy\njustification for any and every contrived action\nor plot point. Card is clearly stretching a limited\nidea to fit an ongoing series, but then I guess\nthat's what pays these days.\nThere are some important questions raised\nabout the nature of religion and personal\nresponsibility, but nothing is really done with\nthese themes. Maybe Card will develop them in\nthe next book in the series, but I for one won't be bothering to read it.\nWell below par for a usually excellent author.\nA better idea of Card's talents can be had from\nEnder's Game or The Tales of Alvin Maker.\nJoe Pineapples\nPublished by: Legend\nPrice: \u00a35.99\nthe sycophantic when discussing Picasso's momentous output, which can't be all good,\nhowever much you like him.\nTheodore Reff, Professor of Art History,\nColumbia University calls this book \"the finest\none volume discussion of his life\" and who\nwould disagree? Anyone interested in Modern\nArt has to broach Picasso sooner before later\nand, if this book has its faults, it remains a good\nstarting point.\nJon\nPublished by: Thames and Hudson\nPrice: \u00a313\nPicasso Exhibition continues at the Tate Gallery\nuntil 8th May.\nFools\nby Pat Cadigan\nWhat kind of world would it be if you could buy\na new personality as easily as a new set of\nclothes? Answer: the world of Fools, a hi-octane\ntale of double-cross and deceit in a future where\nno-one is who they seem - not even yourself.\nThe ambitious and complex plot revolves\naround Marva, a 'method' actress who's about\nto hit the big time. No Hollywood blockbusters\nfor Marva though, she becomes 'famous' by\nselling the rights to her face and her very\nidentity. It's then that Marva discovers she isn't the person she thought she was...and the truth\nmay be more than she can handle.\nThe world Cadigan creates is convincing in\nits seedy, unpleasant detail; a decaying urban\nnightmare with no heroes or villains, just people\ntrying to stay alive. The stark realism of the\nsetting is the book's greatest strength.\nCadigan's writing style suffers from\ncyber-jargon and shifting perspectives; make no\nmistake, this book requires your full attention.\nBut it's definitely worth the effort to enjoy this\nintriguing sci-fi murder mystery.\nJoe Pineapples\nPublished by: Harper Collins\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nThe Call to Earth\nSee the Easter Escapades of the Boat Club on page 7\n\n"

Later I tell a friend\nthat it all sounds like Nirvana anyway, she\nripped them off, it's all dead. I don't realise I'm like the baby-boomers endlessly trapped in a Hendrix whirl.

PJ Harvey, Thalia Zedeck and\nLove make no concessions to their femininity\nand seem twice the women for it (i.e. they seem\nlike Mankind).

Suddenly\nSenser were embraced as the Next Big Thing.\nThe ingredients to this band are Heitham's rapping, Kerstin's poppy vocals and the music\nitself, which shows far more variety than their\nrecent singles would suggest. As well as the\nexpected crunch of 'Eject', you get a fair dose of\ntechno, dub and sampling styles, and a few\ntracks that seem to have all of this at once. There\nare really no weak tracks out of the thirteen on\noffer. Ultimately it's a rap album but tracks such\nas 'The Key' betray their crusty origins,\nsupporting the likes of Ozric Tentacles and Back\nTo The Planet. BTTP blew it at the album stage,\njust as everything was going their way but\nSenser have delivered an album every bit as\ngood as expected. (*) Ridley Dash\nCranium HF 'Summer Rain\nep': Work out what HF stands\nfor and you'll understand what\nthis is about. Hard electronic\nbeats with rhythmical\nchanting in the background.\nSheep On Drugs for sick minds. Mr Happy\nSoundgarden - 'The Day I Tried To Live': The\nlead track is one gentler songs of new album\n'Like Suicide' is an acoustic that sounds\nremarkably like a Mark Lanagan song. Mr Happy\nSheryl Crow - 'Run Baby Run': A song\nsupposedly about the suicide of Aldous Huxley\nmanages to be better than its factual basis. Tintin\nWhiteout - 'Starr Club': I was waiting to rip this\nup but it is really fun. Anyone who can use\nTeenage Fanclub as a yardstick are not all\nserious. Cliqued, happy and proud of it. Tintin\nYo La Tengo - 'From A Motel 6': The demigods\nof the music page return. A single from their\nawesome 'Painful' album would be enough but\nthe additional tracks complete the slow burning\ndynamite right in your rock face. Tintin.\nSalad - 'On A Leash ep': A promising display of\nsound reminiscent of fellow Island sign ee P.J. Harvey only less rasping due to a mellowing\nbaseline. The Pear\nSheep On Drugs'Let The Good Times Roll':\nInventiveness goes walk ies on\nthis. Sounds like N IN on a banality trip. Flock fodder\nonly. The Pear\nSkyscraper - 'Man From Hell': New 12\" from\none of the best British live bands but\nunfortunately their records never match those\nperformances. The B sides on the other hand are\namazing cover versions. Mr Happy\nThe Shams - 'Sedusia': Girl sounds from a single gender band, this had an icy beauty but\nthe angelic tri st only get to live on 'Love Me\nWith Your Mind', which uses the line \"Can you\ntruly conjugate?\". But the rest is sterile. Tintin\nMutha's Day Out - 'Locked': Don't believe the\npress when they try to convince you that this is a brand-new weld of rock and rap; Mutha's Day\nOut's alleged hip-hop influences have melted\nclean away leaving some fairly decent\ngrunge/metal stuff with a bit of shouting in the\nbackground. Quite good but a bit on the limp\nside. Freddy Cheeseworth\nOutside - 'Kaleidoscope Summer': A brassy\nbreeze of warmth, Outside lay down a steady\ngroove but the longer it goes on the feeling\ngrows that it's short of ending sparkle. Tintin.\nSulphur - '2CV: Not to be confused with the\nLloyd Cole song, this is in the current wave of\ncockney vocation and whispering s and a bit\nderivative. Tintin\nKaliphz - 'Vibe Da Joint ep': Going to a place\nwhere grammar never ruled, Kaliphz sound like\nany other hip-hop jokers. Packed with funny\nvoices, the usual streetwise 'lyrics' and skool\nsongs, this is a one-shot affair. Take a decent\ntrack and photocopy to order. Funny in the same\nway Ed Stewart was in Crackerjack. Tintin\nguess what mark Ridley gave? Answers between eight and ten\n\n"

It is, of course, lamentable that not all\nthe entrants could win a prize. We have tried to\nspread the prizes more thinly this time.\nIn the event, there were over thirty entrants\nall of whom made valiant attempts at even the\nmost obscure of clues. Happily, the vast majority\nwere 'new recruits' who had not entered the\nChristmas 3D Crossword Competition. We also\nseem to have reached a wider audience this time.\nThere were entrants from St. Mary's as well as\nprestigious members of staff from Imperial's Physics Department. A straw poll suggested that\nit took an average of two weeks to solve; one\nLevel 4\nsolver commented that his crossword had\ntravelled on aeroplanes and all around the Paris\nmetro.\nThe winners can pick up their prizes from the\nFelix Office (the North-West corner of Beit\nQuad) any day between 12pm and 2pm before\nFriday 20th May, bringing College identification\nwith them. Unclaimed prizes will soon find\nalternative homes (like mine - Catfish, Sub Ed).\nClue Writing Competition\nJudging the Clue Writing Competition was\ndifficult. It revealed a number of potential\ncrossword compilers, all of whom we encourage\nto submit whole crosswords for publication.\nWhat the judges were looking for was well-Level 5\nconstructed clues: correctly ordered but cleverly\nmisleading. Our congratulations go out to the\nwinner 'TIKKA' and the runner-up 'PHOBOS'.\nA certain Patrick Odwo from nothing to do with felix honest also showed potential.\nCome And Get It\nPlease could all of you who want your\ncrossword booklets back come to the Felix\nOffice in the next week to collect them. If not\ncollected, we will throw them out.\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank Chambers for their\ncontinued generous support.\nVive la 3D Difference!\nLevel 6\nLevel 10 Level 11 Level 12\n\n"

The forecast\nwas a gruelling battle against stiff competition.\nOn 26th March, the world's largest single boat\nrace got underway and 3400 rowers put\nthemselves and other competitors to the test. It's a perilous 18 minutes to the finishing post; pacing\nyourself at the start is all important. Imperial\nCollege were mentioned in the BBC's coverage\nof the event, including the fifth Eight who were\nunfortunate in being the last crew to start.\nGood results?

For this, we thank coaches: Bill Mason,\nScoot, Karl Foreman and Nick Wilde, who never\nfailed to equal our mileage in their launches.\nAs attention draws on to the summer regattas\nleading to Henley, training carries on as normal,\nif anything more intensely because, at IC, the\nboa ties know that winning isn't everything - it's the only thing.\nOSC Exec Elections\nOn 11th May in Room 220, Mechanical\nEngineering building at 2pm, elections for posts\nin the Overseas Students Committee Executive\nwill be held.
