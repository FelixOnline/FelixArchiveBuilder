Directed by Peter Sykes;\nstarring Richard Widmark, Christopher\nLee, Honor Blackman and Anthony\nValentine'.\nBLACK MAGIC RITUALS, murder and\nsuspense. Rest assured however, this\nrefrains from indulging in the excesses common to many Hammer films. Blood\nis let sparingly.\nAs occult phenomena are not normally\nencountered by most people, the burden\nof making a Satanic theme believe able is considerable; the onus rests chiefly\nwith the actors. Christopher Lee, having\nplayed many bizzar e and macabre\ncharacters previously, is well suited to\nthe part of Father Michael, an excommunicated priest who forms a convent\ndevoted to the worship of the devil figure of Lord Astorath. He plays the\npart convincingly but with a dignity\nwhich would not, one imagines, be\nfound in an unfrocked priest.\nAs his adversary, combating the\nforces of Evil, Richard Widmark has\nthe harder role. It is difficult to make\na character good without being nauseatingly virtuous, he overcomes this p rgb lem by instilling in the character a ruthless\npracticality.\nAided by brisk direction, the film\nmaintains a desirable tempo. The plot,\no wever, does tend to be slightly\nconfusing as the events of the story* do\nsive side of Black Magic is not ignored.\nAs the plot is fictitious it would be\nunwise to draw any profound conclusions about the practice of the Black Arts in\nreality.

    "content": "Ft ll X5 Socialist Democracy\nQuestion of apathy\nSir, \u2014 I wish to comment on\nthe subject of apathy and\nparticipation at this college. At IC we have a wide spectrum\nof people from different\ncultures, backgrounds and\nwith different interests. A large proportion of these\npeople participate in various\nclubs and societies \u2014\nto verify this you only have\nto go round and ask people\nwhich, if any, of the organisations they participate in. However, for each individual\norganisation, there are only\nrelatively few active members\ncompared with the total\npopulation of the College. This applies to major\norganisations such as ICU\nand the CC U's as well as to\nthe individual clubs and\nsocieties which form the AC C,RC C and S CC. This is because,\nto reap the benefits of\nactive involvement in any one\nclub, one must devote\nsufficient time to it which, to a very large degree, must\nresult in exclusion of\nparticipation in other organ-is at ions. Hence, it is only to be\nexpected that a minority of\nstudents actively support\nICU and the CC U's, because\ndespite having a more general\nrelevance and appeal to\nCoMege members compared to\nspecific appeal of the other\norganisations, these Unions\ntoo are limited. For example,\nif a union organises a concert\nor a bar night, only those\npeople interested in that\nparticular form of entertain-Elections\nSir, \u2014 We would like to express\nour extreme disgust and\ncontempt for the immature\nelection style of Mr Everett's campaign.\nSurely a candidate should\nconcentrate on his own\nproposed policies and the\nreasons why he considers\nhimself suitable for the\nrelevant post, instead of\nindulging, what amounts to,\n\"mud sI ing ing''. Rather than furthering\nhis cause through his\ncampaign, he has merely\nraised doubts, in our minds,\nas to his suitability for the\ndemanding post of Deputy\nPresident.\nYours faithfully,\nCM K LER ST KIMMINS\nMP PITCHERS A CHILDS S FP DAVIS S MOH IN DRAG K NIEUWE NM UI JSA KARUN ARAT NES PURE WALE THE OCH A ROUS J l KAHN ment will attend, that is, people who like the particular\ntype of music played or who\nlike drinking a lot.\nThis causes the unions to\nbe dominated by a certain\ntype of person and leads to\nthe formation of cliques. Thus, through involvement in\nother clubs resulting in a lack of time, the lack in\nappeal of much of what the\nUnion does and the formation\nof union cliques, it is not\nsurprising that the \" average\" IC student becomes apathetic\ntowards his union.\nThe situation is worse at\nIC than at other universities\ndue to the large proportion of\npostgraduates, and overseas\nstudents whose presence\ncreates a larger spectrum of\nneeds to be covered \u2014 thus\nstudents form cliques in their\ndepartments and amongst\ntheir own countrymen. However, this state of affairs\ncannot be blamed on the\nunions \u2014 it would be impossible\nfor them to arrange events\nwhich would appeal to\neveryone.\nI would like to finish on a note aimed at those activists who often point an accusing\nfinger at the non-participating\nmajority. How many of them\nparticipate in other societies to the degree of attempting to\nreduce the stranglehold of\ncliques and providing incentives\nfor them to get involved* in\nunion activities? Yours faithful ly,\nSA SHEN Elee Eng III\nStaff list, credits, etc.\nThanks tu Uave H, Dave K, Dave F, Terry, John, Phil, and Duncan, for helping.\nSpecial reward to Gill for\nrising from her sickbed, and\nIan for putting up with us all. continued from page four '\nTOUCHSTONE This role was held to\nthat of providing acf it i caT. elite whose criticisms, of the\nsystem and society as a whole would be constructive\nrather than destructive.\nIn a free ranging debate,\nduring the evening within\nsub-groups and during the\nfollowing afternoon as a whole group, the conclusion\nwas reached that IC was\nneither of the two cultures\nmentioned. The type of\nculture it should have was eventually not decided upon,\nbut various rituals and\nsuch like were proposed.\nThe main idea here being to\nevolve a totally new culture\nfor the College. COMMUNISTS are often\naccused of being undemocratic, of trying to overthrow\ngovernments elected by the\npeople {perhaps violently)\n\u2014 but, is this true?\nIn Western European\ncountries Communist parties\ntake part in Parliamentary\nelections and considerable\npopular support is expressed\nin some countries (France and\nHaly are examples). In none\nof these countries do the\nCommunist parties advocate\nthe seizure of power (by\narmed means or otherwise)\nby small \" subversive\" groups\nop people. However, they\nalso believe that the present\nsystem of Parliamentary\ndemocracy is not the ultimate\nexpression of people's interests.\nWe enjoy democratic\nrights for the mass of people\nat present \u2014 but only because\nof continued struggle \u2014\nrights such as housing,\ned g cation, health, picketing,\nracial and sexual equality,\nthe right to work etc. These\nare by no means assured and\nGod given \u2014 look at the\ncurrent cuts by Mr Healey.\nThese rights must be defended\nand extended, ultimately into\nareas where they do not\nexist at present, for example,\nat the place of work where\nworkers are at the mercy of\nnon-elected factory owners,\nand thus, finally to Socialism. It is no accident that in\ncountries where there is a minimum of democracy, such\nas Spain, or Portugal before\nApril 1974, Communists are\nin the fore front to end these\nregimes, for free trade union\norganisation and democratic\nelections. Ah, you say, what about\nthe Soviet Union, what does\ndemocracy have to do with\nthe bureaucratic and administrative suppression of dissenting\nviews? It is essential to\npoint out that these antis o cia list acts are in no way\nintrinsic to the ideals of\nSocialism. Stalinism is not\nhistorically inevitable, especially in Britain where\nwe have such strong democratic traditions. It \u2022 is, rather, specific to a country\nwhich attempted to build a new society in very difficult\nhistorical conditions and\nwhich, since it was the first,\nand in that sense an experiment,\nmade many mistakes.\nThis in no way excludes\nthe possibility of a peaceful\ndemocratic transition to\nSocialism in Britain \u2014 the\nonly lasting democracy.\nPete Holland\n(c) Published by the Editorial\nBoard on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications\nand printed Offset-litho on the\nUnion premises.\ni.e. FILM\nSOCIETY\nneeds help for the production of their season next year,\nif films and their presentation interest\nyou please contact: chris dutton physics IE "

For\nthe academic year 1976\u20147, the\n\" vacation element\" of the\nundergraduate grant will be\ntaken to cover the Xmas and\nEaster vacations, but not\nthe summer. Hence in the\nsummer you will be able to\nclaim full benefit without\nany deduction. In the shorter\nvacations you will be\nreceiving, as grant, the\nequivalent of the social benefit for a single non-householder (\u00a38.70 at present).\nThis implies a student living\nat home for the vacations\nwiI I, not be entitled to\nbenefit. However, the 'new'\nvacation element does not\ninclude provision for rent.\nThis arrangement will be\nreviewed again for the\nacademic v ear(1977 \u20148)\nThe present\nThe above does not come\ninto effect until October 1976\nand the same system as\nbefore applies for this Easter\nand summer (that is, if you\ngo home for the vacation\nyou receive benefit less the\n.vacation grant of \u00a33.18).\nAlternatively, if you stay up\nand pay rent you receive\nbenefit plus your rent less\n\u00a33.18. Your rent may not be\npaid in full if it is considered\nto be too high.\nThe currant rates of\nbenefit are:\nMarried couple - \u00a317.75\nSingle householder (ie rent\npayer - \u00a310.90\nPerson in digs' Board and.\nlodging fee plus \u00a33.50\nAnyone else over 18 (eg\nstudent living at home) - \u00a38.70\nAn English President?\nYes, election fever is\nhitting all of us. Next Wednesday we shall be electing\nofficers for next year's committee. All candidates,\nwho should sign up on the\nSouthside Basement notice-board, need one proposer and\ntwo second ers. It must be\nstressed that all members of\nthe College can stand for any\npost, including non-members\nof the society and non-Chinese. For those of you not\nfamiliar with the society, our\nchief aims are the promotion\nof Chinese culture and social is ation amongst our members.\nItn order to achieve these aims\nwe need a committee who can\ncollectively organise functions\nand individually shoulder the\nresponsibilities of their\nposts. It is not necessary to\nknow about Chinese culture\n(although it is useful) or to\nbe able to speak one of the\nmany dialects \u2014 in fact\nbeing of a non-Chinese\nculture could enrich both the\nsocial and cultural aspects\nof the society and present a less formidable front to\nnon-Chinese people. If you\nare interested in standing for\na post, the present committee\nare available for consultation\nin the J CR at lunchtimes.\nThe remaining events of the\nterm are a film show, which\nfollows the el ct ions, and a sherry party to be held on\nThursday 18th March. This latter event is for the\nintroduction of the newly\nelected committee to the\nsociety and will be followed\nby a disco at which presentation of the trophies to the\nwinners of the various LUC SC S games will take place.

Ir reopened at 1.30pm, but with\nabout 60 fewer students; for\nFriday27 th February was the\nday of the national demonstration on grants and education\ncuts. A somewhat diminutive\nhorde gathered outside the\nUnion building and left at 1.15,\nin a specially hired coach.\nAlthough most of IC ignored\nthe occ as sion(\" I couldn't strike, I hdd to do some work\"), about 25,000 students from all over England gathered near\nWaterloo Station, watched\nclosely by television cameras,\nthe National Press and the\nDaily Telegraph.\nThere were even several\nthousand marchers from the\nMetropolitan Police, who\ninsisted on walking on the\noutside of the procession,\npresumably in order to appear\non television.\nThe demonstration marched\nfrom Waterloo Bridge to Hyde\nParte via Oxford Street. The column, when it finally set\noff, stretched for miles. When\nthe leaders reached Oxford\nCircus, the tail-end was just\ncrossing Waterloo Bridge.\nNot everyone supported us, however: an intrepid reporter\nfrom the Daily Telegraph, the\nfollowing day wrote, \"The\ncolumn of casually - dressed\nmarchers, brandishing red\nbanners ... infuriated passersby who s outed back their own\nslogans to the marchers\". The \"infuriated passersby\", was an old man with curiously\nwaving arms who decided,\nagainst his wife's advice, to\nhold his own, individual,\ncounter-demonstration. He\nshouted, according to the\nDaily Telegraph, \"Go back\nto Siberia\" and \"Get on with\nyour work\". What kind of work\nhe did, that enabled him to\nstand on street corners, at\n3.00pm on a Friday afternoon,\nshouting at students, gave\nrise to much speculation. It\nwas rumoured that he was a freelance for the Daily\nTelegraph.\nWhen the marchers finally\nreached Hyde Park, most of\nIC made a dramatic swing to\nthe right and went home,\nleaving a couple of FELIX staff and a bemused Hon Sec\n(John Downs) to absorb the\nspeeches.\nCasually-dressed Charles Clarice made an impassioned,\nif not entirely intelligible\nspeech; \"This is the largest\never demonstration.,.er ...\nsince last year\". He said that\nMr Healey was using \"economic\nsteamroller to crush the life\nand humanity out of society\"\nand Mr Clarke, no featherweight himself, should know.\nMax Morris, president of the\nNational Union of Teachers\nsaid that it was the first\nNUS demonstration to have the\nofficial backing of the NUT. Finally, although it may\ncome as a shock to those IC students who participated,\n(several of whom wore suits),\n\"moderate students were\nconspicuous by their a bsc enc^ and Lionel Zetter of the\nSussex University Conservative\nAssociation, condemned the\nmarch as just another holiday\nevent\" \u2014 Daily Telegraph.\nMr Zetter will surely donate\nany increase in his grant\nequally between Conservative\nCentral Office and the Daily Telegraph fighting fund.\nThe IC contingent at the demo\nJohn Downs being dowsed during the ICWA\nv.

That, by default, gave IC the\ncup. But, in the circumstances\nthere was no pleasure in\nobtaining it. This unsatisfactory\nsituation remained for a few\ndays until there was a phone\ncall from London Hospital to\nsay that, after all, they could\nplay on that date if IC would\nagree. IC, sti11 keyed up\nemotionally for the final, found\nno difficulty in agreeing.\nIC made the journey to\nMotspur Park accompanied by\nabout 50 sop porters intent upon\nwinning the cup for the 12th time since1951. Shortly before\nthe kick\u2014off a touch of colour\nwas added to the scene by the\narrival of further support complete with J ez.A quick' A Vivo' led by Pete Teague confirmed\nthe superiority of the IC support.\nThe game opened with IC playing into the wind. They\nstarted well by winning the first\nscrum against the head . IC's dominance in the pack\ncontinued throughout. In the\nopening minutes \u2022 London\nHospital pressed IC back and\ngot their reward when, after\nnine minutes, their full-back\nkicked the first of his four\npenalties. Twenty-five minutes\ninto the first half saw London\nHospital 9:0 in front, having\nadded a penalty and a drop goal\nto their previous score JC came back into the game and\ndominated the remainder of\nthe half. During this period\nIC missed three crucial\npenalties and halt time\narrived with IC 9:0 down,\nall of their attacks having\nbeen foiled by the accurate\nKicking of the London\nHospital scrum half and\nfull back.\nIC put the pressure on\nfrom the star i of the second\nhalf and within three minutes\nwere awarded a penalty which\nAndy Devaney converted.\nThe pressure on London\nHospital continued. IC were\nnow playing the best rugby\nof the game. The pack consistently won the bali in the\nloose and Terry Fearn passed\nthe ball freely to the backs. At times IC were close to\nscoring: no-one came closer than Phil Turley. However,\nno move was carried to\nfruition. After twenty-two\nminutes London Hospital\nbroke out. IC's covering\nback was good but a crooked\nfeed into the resulting\nscrum conceded a penalty.\nThat gave London Hospital a lead of 12:3. That lead\nwas increased to 15:3 five\nminutes later. IC came back\nwith aven gence and in the\nfollowing five minutes both\nSteve Booth and Keith\nLipscombe were unlucky not\nto score. The pressure did\nresult in a try and that was\nscored by Adrain Williams\nfollowing a penalty on the\nright wing. It was a just\nreward as Adrain had caused\nall sorts of problems for\nLondon Hospital during the-game. An exciting ten minutes\nfollowed but there was no\nfurther scoring despite the\nvaliant efforts of John Smith\nand Paul Robins. It was all\nto late.\nIt could be^ argued that it\nwas really a moral victory for\nIC as they scored the only fry\nof the game, but the cup\nwent to London Hospital\nbecause of their consistent\nIN A THRILLING final\nagainst Hackney Bus Garage,\nIC clinched the London\nBusiness Houses League\nafter finishing runners-up\nthe previous year.\nThe match against Hackney\nwas a double\" banker from\nwhich iC needed to take\nfive out of the possible six points to be assured of the\nchampionship, (each team\nconsists of three players\nand each match consists of\nthree frames each, a point\nbeing awarded to the winner\nof each game.)\nPhil Chester and Steve\nWell both won their matches,\nbut John Healy playing with\na borrowed cue (his cue\nhaving been stolen the\nnight before) lost his first\nmatch.

If they had played\nduring the second half\nvictory could have been\ntheirs. However, it was an\nentertaining and exciting\ngame between two very good\nfifteens. Both sides emerged\nwith credit.\nHearty thanks are due to\nthe IC Supporters contingent\nwhose vociferous support\nwas appreciated by the team.\nTeam:- B Finney, A Williams,\nM Cotter, N Gibbs, M West,\nA Devaney, T Fearn, I Maclain, Ft Austin, R Doyle,\nK Lipscombe, S Booth, J Smith, P Robins (Capt),\nP Turley.\nReferee: D Head (London Soc.)\nsecond match after a tremendous struggle.\nThis championship was\nmade possible by some fine\nperformances earlier in the\nseason: notably the two\nvictories over JD Burns who\nwere the other main challengers\nfor the league. Charlie Yates, t ne team's regular No. 3, was\nunable to play in the last\nfour matches. of the season,\nbut his two victories over\nthe City of London Police helped keep IC in contention.\nPhil Chesters who has\nplayed at No. 1 for the ' B' team for the last two years,\nhas in that time only lost\none match and he is probably\nthe main reason for the\nCollege team \u2022being such a strong force in the London\nBusiness Houses League.\nW LF A111 Frames: 23 6\n10 2 21 6\n3 4 9 8\n4 0 8 1\n1 0 2 1\n11 1 57 22\nGreasy\nPete\ninjured\nBuckhurst Hill ' B'10 Imperial College 14\nON SATURDAY21 st of\nFebruary Imperial College Lacrosse Club set off to\nEpping Forest. Being able to\nuse the ACC van, (thanks to\nMike Burke for driving! it made\nthis epic journey much easier\nthan in previous years. And\nwith the Captain's impeccable\nnavigation)?) we only got\nlost once.\nSo we arrived, on time,\nbut with only eight players.\nStill we were looking forward\nto a fairly enjoyable game, as\nBuckhurst Hill are one of the\nfriendliest clubs in the south\nof England; and we got one.\nThe first quarter was a typical start, in which neither\nside dominated the other and\nthe attack and defence found\nout who were the opposition's danger men. At the end of the\nfirst quarter IC led by 3\u20142.\nThis actually helped boost\nIC's confidence, as we were\nex pec ti ng to be com pre hens i ve Iy hammered, Bucks having a man\nadvantage.\nHowever the second\nquarter was a bit of a blow.\nAs usual we got a bit lax in\nour marking and fighting for\nthe ball. Greasy Pete in\ngoal did a good job and kept\nthe score down to 6\u20144 for\nBucks at half time.\nIn the third quarter the\nattack and in particular\nRichard Forster and Derek\nSenner did a lot of fine work,\nand both managed to get on the\nscore sheet. Meanwhile the\ndefence did a solid job and\ndidn't give away a single\ngoal. After the third quarter\nIC led by 7 - 6 . It was good to\nsee Rob Morrison in defence\ndo so well in his first game.\nAfter this amazing come\nback (a rare occurrence)\nEfrem Zimbalist Junior Mark\nII put the match out of Buckhurst Hills reach by scoring\nfour goals in as many minutes.\nThen it was just a case of the\ndefence trying to stop Bucks from scoring, while the attack\ngot back every goal IC\nconceded. In the last quarter\nGreasy Pete in goal got a bruise on his arm, which he\ninsisted I mention in the\nreport. Some people are proud\nabout the silliest things.\nOne thing that does deserve\na mention is the last goal of\nthe match. This was one of\nthe best moves of the game In\nwhich J Edgar Hoover Mark II\ngained possession, ran\ntowards goal and passed!') to\nDerek Senner who had run\nround the back of the defence\nand slotted the ball home.\nFinal score 1 4 - 1 0 In IC's favour.
