    "content": "2 FELIX 11 December 1968\nA GHOST FROM THE PAST IN QUO RATE UNION MEETING Attendance at the last IC Union meeting on Thursday\n28th November returned to a more familiar level of about\n200, and, as well could have been predicted at the outset,\nit was put out of its confused agony when the quorum\nwas challenged. Four motions were considered, including\na most important one from George Assimakis which was\nlost in a cloud of amendments before finally being killed\nby Les Ebdon.\nBut. first things first. The\nproposal to accept the standing orders, copies of which\nwere circulated among those\npresent, was accepted nem.\ncon. after some amendments were accepted, and a motion calling for suo port for Iranian students suffering\ntinder oppression from the\nPersian Government went\nunopposed.\nHalls\nThen, the motion that\nproduced the great disse n tion. George Assimakis\nproposed that the percentage\nof fresher s in Halls of Residence should remain constant at 25 per cent, contrary to the College Administration's recommendation\nto offer half of next year's applicants a place in Halt\nHe argued that such an increase would mean very few\n2nd and 3rd year students\nwould be able to get in Hall,\nand it was these who formed\nthe backbone of most societies and committees. It\nwould also mean that students failing to get a place\nin Hall for their first year\nwould have little chance of\ngetting in at all.\nSpeaking against the mo-tion, Rob Collinge said that\nthe majority of fresher s were\nforced to spend their first\nyear in digs and so had little\nchance of playing a very\nactive part in College affairs.\nThis was supported by Jon\nShields, who pointed out\nthat fresher s were in he\nworst position to go into\ndigs, and proposed that the\npercentage in Hall be taken\nto 35 per cent, an amendment which was rejected by\nGeorge Assimakis.\nUnder prompting from\nLes Ebdon, however, he was\npersuaded to amend the motion to cover all College\nresidence, including Student\nHouses, and it was immediately pointed out that, since\nthe proportion of fresher s in\nStudent Houses was relatively small, as the number\nof Houses grew, the percentage of fresher s in Hall\nwould rise. Before the motion could be amen -d fur-ther, Les Ebdon rose to\ndeliver the finishing thrust,\naccusing all concerned of\n\"not doing their homework\"\nand complaining about the\nprocedure. He moved the\nnext business and this was\nthankfully carried.\nFinally, Piers Corbyn proposed that I.C. should donate \u00a325 to MORA DE, the\nmovement to improve the\nstandard of art education,\nand this was opposed by\nRob Collinge, whose main\nargument was that if we're\ngoing to give money away,\nthere must be something\nmore worthwhile to give it\nto.\nAt this point, Bob Mackman, last year's RCS President, decided to challenge\nthe quorum and with a hundred too few people in the\nConcert Hall there was no\nalternative but to finish.\nNEWSFROMTHE\nPROVINCES\nICs mascot Mike, still with us 18 days af tei its recovery,\nwas paraded round the three constituent college union\nmeetings on December 3rd. In a break from tradition,\nthe Mines' Union meeting discussed, for the first time in\nliving memory, a motion on a subject which is really ICU business, the percentage of fresher s in hall, while RCS talked about Morphy Day and their internal politics. Guilds\noccupied themselves with entertaining the members of their\ncongregation.\nMines\nThe motion at Mines recommended that 35 per cent\nof nest year's fresher s should be given Hall places\nand after a lot of discussion\nthis was passed. This seems\nan eminently sensible idea\nand a good compromise between the existing arrangements and the proposals\nwhich have recently been\nbrought forward by the administration to raise the\nlevel to 50 per cent (see\nfront page article). Also\ndiscussed was the annual\nforeign students visit in the\nlast week of term when 12\nor 13 students from Norway, Germany, Jugoslavia\nand other places will be\nentertained by R.S. M. at\nvarious functions including\nthe Mines Ball on the last\nday of term. On a more\nlight-hearted note, the mascot bearers were sentenced\nto walk placarded and be-chained along Oxford Street\nat the Mines Carol Singing\ntomorrow.\nR.CS. Meanwhile, in the Chemistry building, RCS were\ndiscussing ways of making\nthe Morphy Day battle less\ndangerous, a motion being\npassed dissociating RCSU\nfrom the towpath battle\nwhile still supporting the\nboat race. A motion was\npassed almost unanimously,\nrecommending that the post\nof R CSU rep. on Council be\nautomatically filled by the\nAcademic Affairs Officer;\nthis will have to be ratified\nby a further meeting of\nRCSU. Also, RCS decided\nthat Mines should give 50\npints of blood for the return\nof the Davy Lamp.\nGuilds\nOver in Guilds, a motion\nwas proposed in, it is hoped,\na light-hearted manner by C. Parker censuring FELIX This was passed \" unanimously \" Although no opposing speeches were al-lowed. The only item of\nimportance was a letter fro n the organisers of the Brigr.\nton Veteran Car Rur informing us that Boanerges\nwould probably not be allowed to take part in the\nrun next year. This is apparently due to arriving too\nearly in Brighton this year.\nEntries were invited from\ndepartments for the Festival\nfor Music and Culture, to\nbe held at Guilds' next\nmeeting.\nTOUCHSTONE\nAbout twenty people spent\nthe weekend 30th November/ 1st December discussing\nthe Society amid the\npeace and tranquillity of\nSilwood Park. The Speaker\nwas Dr. Jonathan Gould, a consultant psychiatrist formerly of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, making his second\nvisit to Touchstone, who began b v defining the words\n\"degenerate\" and \"society,\"\nhence coming to a conclusion on the definition of the\n\" degenerate society.\"\nCrime \u2014 even excluding\nmotoring offenses\u2014had increased three times over the\niast twenty years and this\nrise showed no signs of\nlevelling off. Similar increases in the divorce rate\nand the number of heroin\naddicts apparently showed\nother signs of degeneracy in\nour society. However, Dr.\nGould made it clear, with\nthe aid of statistical evi-den ce, that this degeneracy\nonly affected a very small\npercentage of the pop ul a tion.\nThe rest of the weekend,\napart from Sunday morning\n(spent in reading the papers\nand walking for miles across\nWindsor Great Park), was\ntaken up in discussing the\nquestions raised in the\nspeech.\nAlthough it was un de eid ed whether degeneracy in\nsociety really mattered or\nnot, it was generally agreed\nthat a fully permissive so-cie ty, where all crime, im-morality, etc. was tolerated,\nwould be both im or act ical and undesirable. However,\nno ideas were put forward\nas to how to stop society degenerating and the discussion finally degenerated\nwhen we went and had tea.\nIncidentally, Touchstones\nare worth 15/- even if-you\nonly go for the much-better-than-Mooney meals!\nELECTRONIC MUSIC\n\"Consider weighted parametric si multan ei ties between channels to be a function of poetic accent.\"\nRather confusing, as is\nthe music to which this extract from a sleeve note re-fer s. It was taken from a new set of \"Nonesuch\"\nrecords, Polydor's subsidiary label, in which electronic\nand contemporary music is\npresented.\nThere are five single LPs,\nKenneth Garburo's Music\nfor voices, instruments and\nelectronic sounds,\" Andrew\nRudin's \"Tragoedia,\" Iannis\nXenahis and Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage and\nLukas Foss's\" Baroque\nVariations,\" and Morton\nSubotnik \" Silver apples on\nthe moon.\"\nThis new batch takes\nsome time to play and even\nlonger to enjoy. At first the\nmusic tends to intrude rather\nthan form a background but\nall the records are well produced and retail at about\n25/- each, good value for\nthe converted and the ad\nventurous.\nAn interesting point arises\nfrom the Garburo sleeve\nnote. \" You are required\nto assemble isolated phonemes, words and word\nchains by, way of mental\njuggling activity.\" Instruction presumably on how to\nconstruct an approachable\nform of the music; I feel it\nwould be better \" juggled \"\nbefore recording.\nThe collection also includes a boxed double LP. \"The Nonesuch guide to\nelo c tronic music.\" Very informative and the opening\ntrack, \" Peace Three \" is\nexcellent but would suit a record library rather than a personal collection, m less of\ncourse you're kinky .or pure\nsine waves and sawtooth\nwaveforms, etc.\nIf anyone knows of the\n\"Jasperson resonance chart\"\nplease drop a note to FELIX, also experimenting in\nelectronic music.\n1 1 | X ti1 Sift* '-f0M1 At the last Guilds Union meeting, a copy of FELIX is\nwaved hysterically in the air as Chris Parker proposes a motion of censure on this popular publication. Because\nof jeering from our loyal supporters, very little of his\nspeech was heard!\nFESTIVAL\nOF\nFOOLS\nFESTIVAL OF FOOLS '68\nA new perspective for\nfool-watching is provided\nby the FESTIVAL OF FOOLS '68 when Ewan\nMacColl and the London\nCritics Group deliver this\nyear's edition at a London\npub-theatre (New Merlin's Cave, Margerv St., W.C. I) from 27th to 30th December\nand from 1st to 12th January. It is produced and\ndirected by Ewan MacColl,\nassisted by Peg^ Seeger,\nand Written by MacColl and\nthe London Critics Group\nand a group of young singers\nand writers.\nFESTIVAL OF FOOLS\n'68 uses song, poetry, drama\nand mime to dissect and reveal the events of 1968\u2014\ntheir facts, their implications, their inanities. Often\ndirect, but more often satirically hilarious, FESTIV AL OF FOOLS '68 inverts\nthe world to present it as it\nis . . . not as one might wish\nit to be. The inferences are\nsurprising, disturbing, perhaps angering. The conclusions are open to the\nharsh realm of choice.\nTICKETS (7/6) FROM S.O 'CONNOR, 75 CHA NDOS AVENUE, W.5. ALL MY\nLOVING\n\" All my Loving\" was the\nmost stirring piece of television to appear in recent\nmonths.

The album features\n15 different artists and is\nobviously intended to whet\nyour appetite so that you\nwill rush out and buy their\nindividual L.P.s. The artists\nthemselves are a good cross-section of contemporary\nAmerican folk-rock musicians, with Simon & Garfunkel, Taj Mahal, Moby\nGrape, Leonard Cohen, and\n11 others, all good. The\nonly fault of this record is\nthat the material is arranged\nso as to give continual\nchanges of pace and mood,\nwhich doesn't for instance\nmake it a good party record.\nThis is a minor criticism\nhowever, and fc those with\na leaning towards prophet\nPeel, this offers a cheap introduction D musical mind\nexpansion.

L.H.C. B.2. \"Wheels of Fire.\"\nCream. Polydor.\nThis is a double LP, one\nrecord made in the studio\nand the other a live recording made at the Fillmore\nStadium, California. This\nlive performance features\ntwo very long tracks,\n\" Spoonful,\" good solos b v Clapton and 15 minutes of\ndrum solo from Ginger\nBaker. Whether a drummer of Baker's skill warrants\na solo of such length is\ndoubtful. The studio LP, similar to their earlier work,\noffers an interesting contrast\nto their live performance.\nAn expensive record, but a must for all Cream fans and\na very good example of contemporary blues-based British pop.\n3. Pentangle. \"Sweet\nChild.\" Transatlantic\nTRA 178\nYet another of the flock\nof double LPs being issued\nof late is the Pentangle's\" Sweet Child.\" This, their\neagerly awaited second LP, consists of two sides recorded live at the group's concert at the Festival Hall last\nJune and two sides studio\nrecorded. The Pentangle\nsing and play traditional and\nmodern folk, jazz and blues\nwith fantastic originality and\nskill in rhythm and timing;\ntheir versatility is certainly\ndemonstrated on this LP. The two guitarists, Bert\nJansch and John Renbourn,\nstretch from Charlie Mingus's\" Goodbye Pork-pi\nhat\" to \" Three dances,\" a short collect i orr of very traditional lute ballads. Jacqui\nMcShee's penetrating voice\ncan deliver blues such as\n\"Your money green\" and\ntraditional songs like \" Button Town\" and \" So vay\" with equal effect. Terry\nCox and Danny Thompson,\ntwo former \" session men,\"\nprovide good rhythm back r ing on bass, drums and occasionally glockenspiel.\nThe title track \"Sweet\nchild \" and \" The trees they\ndo grow high \" are the best\nsongs on this brilliant LP.\n4. Rolling Stone*\n\"Beggar's Banquet\"\nRather overshadowed by\nthe Beatles' LP release, bat\nprobably typical Stones' ma-teri al, since written by Jagger and Richard.\n5.

CBS 63101 stereo.\nThis is not a new LP,\nhaving been released over\nfour months ago. The justification for including it here\nis that it is probably one of\nthe most beautiful records\nto be issued this year. The\nsoft and caressing melodies,\nwith the tender lyrics, partly\nexplain the record's undoubted charm. The songs\ndo not tell a story, merely\nattempt to produce an image\nor tie down a line of\nthought, giving the record a timeless quality. To my\nmind, the best record of folk\nto emerge from America\nsince Dylan went rock.\n2. Jethro TulL \" This was.\"\nIsland\nA modern blues t record with some Cream influence.\nOn the \"Island\" label, the\nrecord is well produced for\na small company. It becomes somewhat tedious unless one is an enthusiast.\n3. \"Jon! Mitchell \" Elektra\nFor modern folk purists,\nJoni Mitchell's first LP on\nElektra, wistfully titled\n\"Joni Mitchell,\" is an excellent buy. Joni, a slim,\ngolden - haired Canadian,\nsings simple and very pretty\nsongs accompanying herself\non guitar. The best tracks\non this beautiful LP are\n\"Marcie\" and \"So busy\nbeing free.\"\n4. Tom Paxton. \" Morning\nAgain.\" Elektra.\nSee last week's review. If\nyou enjoy Tom Paxton\nyou'll enjoy this LP.\n5. The Family; \"Music in\na Doll's House.\" Reprise\nRLP 6312\nThe Family are one of\nthe better groups currently\naround. They come from\nLeicester; the Farinas, two\nof whom form the nucleus\nof the Family, were a big\nname locally some years ago.\nAs the LP came out a while\nago, I won't go into much\ndetail. It is good. The\ngroup have an American\nflavour about them. John\nWhitney, one of the original\nFarinas, has leanings towards jazz, and plays clarinet or sax on stage. There\nis also an electric violin in\nthe lineup. Try and see\nthem for yourselves.\n6. Big Brother and the\nHolding Co. \" Cheap\nThrills.\" CBS\nA\" live on stage \" album\nfeatures, or more correctly,\nis dominated by the incredible voice of Janis Joplin. The album is a selection\nfrom two gigs by Big Brother and the Holding Company at San Francisco's Auditorium; on five of the\nseven tracks Janis takes the\nlead. Her voice, sometimes\nsoft, mostly raw and wild,\noverlays a series of crude\nskeletal backings to produce\none of the most exciting\ncurrent sounds around.\nRaw, violent, harsh, im-mediate, the whole L.P. parallels much of present-day imagery.

    "content": "I FELIX 11 December 1968\nWhen the Architectural Association becomes part of\nImperial College in a few years' time, there will have to be\nan Order in Council, i.e. Parliamentary Approval, reconstituting the Governing Body of the College in order to\nbring in members of the A. A. This presents the best of all\npossible opportunities for the student body to gain representation on the most important of College Committees.\nWhy should we have a voice on the Governing Body?\nWell, take a look at the recent happenings in Art Colleges\nlike Guildford and Hornsey. In these places, the administration has paid scant attention to the views and demands\nof their students. The only action that has been taken is\nto seemingly double-cross the student. In this College we\nare fortunate in having a fairly benevolent Rector who,\nwhile he may not be exactly pro-student, is concerned\nabout ICs external image and would probably go a long\nway to avoiding a situation such as the one that periodically\ncrops up at LSE. The re constitution of the Governing\nBody would provide an adequate opportunity to sidestep\nthis danger by making provision for student representation\non the committee. It is also important to realise that such\na danger does exist, even in this most insular and reactionary of colleges. The events at Birmingham University (a science biased university) could hardly have been foreseen a few years ago and the growing awareness of student rights\ncoupled with external stimuli, like the events at LSE and\nBirmingham, could easily create a similar situation here\nin the near future.\nWhat can we do to help ourselves to get su via voice\nin College affairs? The first requisite is, obviously, to\nhave a strong Student Union, a Union which really does, as\nthe Blue Book puts it, \"safeguard and advance the interests of students at the Imperial College.\" The Union\nmust be representative of the students at IC and be able\nto act democratically and swiftly in the fields of policy and\ndecision making. It should be with this thought in mind\nthat Martin Bland and bis Constitutional Reform Committee are working. Two things they have in mind are\nlowering the quorum for the Union General Meeting and\ndemocratic election of the President by ballot of the whole\nUnion. There is another proposal before them, one which\ncould only be included at the expense of having the whole\nnew constitution rejected. This proposal is the abolition\nof the Constituent College Unions.\nThe fu st essential of a strong Union is that people feel\na part of it. The general feeling at the present is that\npeople belong to RS MU,C& GU, or RCSU, rather than\nICU. This, in many ways, is the wrong attitude to take.\nIt is Imperial College Union that deals with the important\nmatters like grants, student housing and union facilities.\nAlthough the constituent college unions do valuable work\nin the field of academic affairs and staff-student relations,\nthese might well be better dealt with by either ICU or\n(preferably) by the individual departments concerned. Immense damage is done to ICU by the importance which is\nattributed to the three smaller unions. Remember, a Strong ICU is necessary for adequate participation in College and nationals Student affairs.

This motion needed\na \u00a7 majority to be carried\nand in fact got 64 per cent\nof the vote, just 2.7 per cent\nshort (from FELIX figures).\nIC Union should be involved in this debate which\nso ci early affects the fundamental nature of the only\nnational student union. To\nremain outside is to be impotent and ridiculous.\nGeoff Martin showed the\ninvalidity of his own position of opposition to the\nmotion in his speech the day\nbefore. He said \" There is\na real possibility that the\nfrightening 'Powellite hysteria ' of the right and the\nwild-eyed extremists of the\nleft are bent on a course\nleading to violence.\"\nThe NUS is clearly a political organisation if its\npresident sees fit to produce\nthis kind of statement and\nIC Union should join the\nNUS so that it has a share\nin shaping the organisation\nthat is always taken as presenting the concensus of\nopinion among students in\nBritain.\nMAI HEW DUNCAN-JONES.\nChairman, Socialist Soc.\nDoes Exec.

I do not\naccept this view, both\n\" Japans\" operate simultaneously and together.\nMost Japanese live in small\nhouses with rat omi( bamboo\nmatting)bedroom, wear the\nkimono as it suits them, understand the importance of\nthe tea ceremony (every\neducated young girl has\nlearned it), eat Japanese\nfood with chop sticks, respect and use the temples\noccasionally), revere Japanese morals, manners and\ncustoms. Coca-Cola, pop,\nfast cars, gambling and images of swinging London go\nhand in hand with the rest\nof life but will not super cede it\u2014as - typical Japanese girl\nwould tell you\u2014even if she\nwas chewing gum. It i* interesting to note that western style\" dance halls in\nJapan do not function in at\nall the way you might expect\nthem to, and many Japanese\nyoung people imagine there\nis some kind of \" step \" to\n\" go-go \" (party dancing).\nThe Japan \"paternalistic\"\ntravel bureau might give the\nwrong idea about Japan.\nYou need to go on a few\nslow trains, sleep on some\nstations and go off the tourist tracks to discover the\nJapanese people. Everywhere you go the people are\nvery kind, polite and extremely helpful apart from\nbeing a little curious about\nyou; but westerners who\nhave a habit of taking selfish disadvantage of the selflessness of others should\nlearn an ancient Japan. \u00b0.\nsaying \" Never ask even\nyour father to do something\nfor you unless it is necessary.\" Japanese people are very\nready to accept foreigners\nwho are genuinely interested\nin Japan but have preferences\u2014a student told me that\nJapanese preferred English\nto Americans because they\nhave \" cultural and historic\nexperience and appreciation,\nbut the Americans do not.\"\nFinally I should say what\nthe \" national character \"\nrespects\u2014in England it is\ninventiveness, high quality\nand high performance\u2014in\nJapan it is hard work, the\nability to learn from others,\nand study.\nPIERS CORBY N In the summer I was a member of a third year\ngroup project arranged with\nthe University of Sierra\nLeone through contacts in\nthe IC Electrical Engineering Department. i There were some difficulties in organising the pro-j ect. To begin with there\nwere two military coups in\nSierra Leone during our\ntime of correspondence. The\nsecond major problem was\nmoney. The first break\ncame with \u00a375 from the Old\nCentralians and useful contacts were supplied by their\nSecretary Mr. Holbein, as\nwell as by the Pro-Rector,\nLord Jackson of Burnley. I would suggest that the only\nway to finance a trip like\nthis is peron al contact!\" The\nLast summer I spent ten weeks in Zambia, not far from\nthe Congo border, working in one of the copper mines.\nThis was made possible by winning an Anglo-American\nVacation Scholarship, which comprised the air fare to and\nfrom Zambia, pay at \u00a370 per month, a four-bedroomed\nbungalow (shared with four others), a house boy and a bicycle.\nbiggest support came from\nthe John Beard travelling\nfund of the Institution of\nElectrical Engineers who\ncontributed \u00a3300.\nOur work included installing a15 kV A generator, repairing a smaller one, erecting li miles of overhead li rr and designing a hydro\nscheme.\nJOHN T. GRAY. The work one was given\ndepended on one's course,\nand to a certain extent what\none was interested in. As a mechanical engineer I spent\none month on the surface\nand one month underground\n(being concerned with plant\nmaintenance). However,\nlike any. industrial training\nit depended on the individual how much benefit he\ngot from the work.\nOn the social side, meeting people was made much\neasier by joining some of the\nmany sports clubs. Girls\nwere in short supply but not\nimpossibly so, judged by the\nfact that one student had\nfour girls clam our ing to play\nwith him in the mixed tennis\ntournament and he wasn't even a good tennis-player.\nIn the evening life tended\nvery much to revolve around\nthe bottle. At week ends\nthere was usually a private\nparty to go to. These varied\nINDIA\nFrankfurt, Saltzburg, Salonika, Istanbul, Damascus,\nBaghdad, Esfahan, Teheran,\nHerat, Kabul, Khyber Pass,\nLahore, Simla, Delhi\u2014what\ndo these names have in com-mon? Those who are map\naddicts and others who take\nan interest in the activities\nof the Sunday Express and\nSunday Telegraph will recognise these as being\nroughly on the route to\nIndia.\nThe Commonwealth Expedition 1969\u2014COMEX III\nis already under way despite the political troubles\nmet with by COME XI in\n1965 and the tragedy of\nCOME X II. While Mr. Wilson with his infamous machinations with Ian Smith\nadvances another step in \u2022\nwrecking the Common-'\nwealth, 500 people are deciding to go overland to\nIndia to demonstrate their\nfaith in it.\nBeing a member of COK\nEX II, I can safe lv assert th's is an experience not to be\nmissed and once accomplished, not to be forgotten.\nTo give an idea of what\nCOME X does and achieves\nit suffices to quote some\ncomments on it.\n\" On29 th July, Duncan\nMatthew, leader of the Scottish contingent of COME XI, was married to Rosie\nRoberts of the same con,.n gent. Early in July, Bob\niB ebbing ton of Cambridge\nand Julie Harris of Cardiff\nwere married. There may be\nothers!\"\n\" There is no signpost to\nDelhi from Charing Cross\nbut the road over London\nBridge was approximately\nin the right direction.\"\n\"In Turkey, an additional\nnavigating task is to wave to\nlittle boys with stones in\ntheir hands so that they will\ndrop them to wave back instead of throwing them.\"\n\" In Iran we discovered\nthe meaning of the word\ncorrugation. The road is\nmade up of regular humps,\nfour feet apart, between\nthree and six inches high,\ncontinuing for 400 miles.\n(The optimum speed is 27\nmph for minimum os cilla tion.)\"\n\"The second night of\nCOME X II\u2014Concert of\ndances, choirs and jazz music . . . there could be no\ndoubt about it, this is what\nthe Delhi boys and girls\nwanted. Long after the\nshow was over you could\nnot separate the Delhi teenagers from their counterparts of COME X.\"( More\ngoodwill was achieved than\nall the politicians of the\nCommonwealth can hope to\nproduce.)\nCOME X III will depart\non 15th July 1969 and return to London on 8th Oct.\nNow that practically all\nof Europe has come within\nthe scope of three-week\npackage tours, FELIX looks\nbeyond our little backyard.\nSummer vacations offer\nstudents the time to go almost anywhere in the world,\nwhile there are many organisations which offer the op-port unity, through cheap\ncharter flights or in other\nways. Longer journeys\ninevitably require earlier\nplanning\u2014now is the time\nto start acting. Many of\nthese organisations are listed\nin our \"details\" column,\nwhile elsewhere some IC\npeople tell you what they\ndid last summer. You can\ncontact them through FELIX. Your College years are\npossibly your last chance to\nsee the world. You could\nalways join the Army, of\ncourse.\nfrom boozy bottle parties to\nextravagant barbecues, with\na group to provide the mu-sic, and enough drink to\nkeep the School of Mines\nparalytic for a year.\nDuring our time there we\nwere given ten days paid\nleave. Most people took it\nat the end of the stay, thereby having effectively a fort-night. Some people used\nthis time travelling to Cape\nTown to come back by boat,\nliving like millionaires for\neleven long days, spending\nall their hard-earned sav-in gs. Others, like me, by\nhitch-hiking and hiring a car\ntoured Zambia, seeing the\nKariba dam, the Victoria\nFalls and the Fafue game\nparks, places you normally\nseen only in films.\nAlthough Zambia is not\na place I am likely to return\nto, and at' times life was\nextremely dull, I found the\nscholarship very worthwhile\nfor the first-hand knowledge\nI received of this part of\nAfrica in political, racial\nand economic terms.\nMIKE COCKER TON AMERICA Pan-Am DC-8 BUN AC charter flight No. NA6037\narrived in New York on a warm humid July afternoon.\nTwo hours later I was installed in a large luxurious hotel\nroom with a telephone and a thirteen-channel T.V.

Back in Toronto and\ndown to my last $30 I bought the $30 ticket to\nWinnipeg where my sister\nlives. I worked in Winnipeg as a shipper for three\nweeks and then set out with\n$200 to see the U.S.A. in\nthe three weeks left. I travelled on a \"visit U.S.A.\" unlimited air travel ticket.\nMy first stop was via Kansas City, Denver and Las\nVegas, to San Francisco, the\nGolden City.

The individual cost\nis about \u00a350 there and back.\nThe participants are expected to do all the organizing\nthemselves in a co-operative\nfashion: eg fund raising,\nagreeing to exist on chapatis\nand marmite to keep costs\ndown.\nHelp to make COME X III a flawless success.\nN.B. \u2014The best loo between\nhere and India is on the road\nbetween Linz and Maribor\nin Austria, Five star\u2014not\nto be missed.\nRAKESH MOHAN AUSTRALIA\nEarly last July, 120 students met at the English Speaking Union in Charles Street having won places on a12 week visit to Australia. The briefing, accompanying the\nhanding out of tickets was short and to the point, with\nfrequent warnings of \" when-in-Australia-do-as-the-Aus-tr alian s\" type.\nOur flight left in the early evening and arrived in Australia 24 hours later, after stops at Bahrain, Karachi and\nSingapore.\nThe trip, whose full title\nwas The 1968 Australian\nworking visit for British Undergraduates, was the 6th to\nbe run by the ESU. There\nare two qualifications : you\nmust be an Undergraduate\nat a British University, and\nyou must have \u00a3150 to pay\nfor the air fare. If they\nlike you at the interview,\nyou will get a seat on the\nplane; you usually hear\nabout a month after the in-ter view. A condition of the trip is\nthat you should work for\neight weeks or more, although some people seemed\nto work for less time. The\njob is arranged before you\nleave England by ESU, who\ntake into account your own\npreference. The final confirmation is left to you\u2014\nif you are unlucky a small\nfortune can be spent on air\nmail letters to Australia. I was lucky enough : I asked\nfor a job with an Agricultural Engineering firm in\nWestern Australia, preferably in Perth. What was arranged for me was Production Engineering and Research and Development\nwork with a firm making\ntractors and ' farm ma-chi nery, some five miles\nfrom the centre of Perth.\nI lived with the family of\none of their employees. The\nbenefits of this were twofold : I had a good chance\nto see the Australian way\nof life at first hand, and it\nenabled me rapidly to discover the ins and outs of my\njob. Other students lived in\nhostels, flats, hotels, or one\nroom digs. I think living\nwith a family was as good as\nanything.\nObviously enough, the\nweekdays were spent at\nwork. At the weekends I would look round the city,\nor fly to places like Kalgorie\nor Pemberton. The Australians spend much of their\ntime at weekends eating bar\nbe que d steaks in their na\nt ional parks, and you. will\nlikely find yourself doing\nthe same.\nAfter working, there are\nseveral weeks to spare before flying back. A number\nof people flew round the\ncontinent; this is an expensive way to spend the time\nA friend and I bought a seventeen year old Austin\npointed it,towards Sydney,\nand set off. Three days and\na thousand miles later, two\nexhaust valves burnt out,\non the edge of the Nullabor desert. After a day's delay while new valves were\nbrought from Adelaide 400\nmiles away, we set off again.\nWe reached Sydney four\ndays before our return flight\nafter another change of\nvalves. We got only \u00a35 (a loss of \u00a340) for our mobile\nmuseum-piece, and the end\nof a fascinating journey of\nthree thousand miles.\nOver the whole trip I spent \u00a340 on top of the \u00a3150\nfor the plane : it would be\nhard to live for three months\nand travel 35,000 miles for\nless than \u00a3190.\nROBIN HAMILTON took a frightening flight\nright into the canyon and\ntook some very good photo-graphs.\nTo St. Louis next, through\nPage Cedar City and Denver\n(again); Here I lost my\nbaggage but managed to\nretrieve it after two hours.\nI had to change my plans of\ngoing to Chicago because of\nriots there so flew via Nashville to New Orleans.\nI found New Orleans\nsecond only to San FranCisco. It was suffocating ly humid but the jazz was\ngreat.\nA couple of days before\nmy home flight was due to\nleave I travelled to New\nYork via an English Air Force base, where I had to\nsurrender my camera, and\nWashington. I arrived back\njust in time to catch my\nflight back to the damp\ngreen fields of England.\nC*S. MUDA Nr ANTARCTICA\nUnfortunately, no one from IC visited Antartica. By\nway of r isolation, External Affairs plan to make arrangements with various travel organisations for representation\nat IC. Details will possibly appear in the Union Upper\nLounge, early next term.\nDETAILS The International Association for the Exchange of\nStudents for Technical Experience will send students overseas to jobs in industry relating to their University course.\nPreference is given to second year students and to students\nwho have had industrial experience in Britain. The number\nof places available abroad depends largely on the number\nof overseas students seeking employment in British industry.\nStudents have to make their own travel arrangements but\nIAESTE will obtain work permits and make special\narrangements in certain cases to allow work for a limited\nperiod (for example, in the U.S.A., where you may otherwise be in danger of being drafted.) Insurance against\npersonal accident and baggage loss is strongly advised and\ncan be arranged through Sanders' International Travel\nLtd.. 134/136 Cromwell Road, Tel:3736401. Applications should be made to Mr. Meacock at the\nRegistry.\nB.U.N. A.C. The British Universities North America Club, as its name\nimplies, is concerned solely with the States and Canada.\nIt arranges cheap transport and sometimes employment\nthere, though the latter may not be connected with the\nstudent's course.

    "content": "COUNCIL\nSPLIT AT\nJURGO\nThis year's first meeting of JUR GO, the Joint Union,\nRectors and Governors Committee, took place on the 2nd December and found the student ranks in disarray. With\na negative attitude being shown by the Rector and Deans,\nCouncil failed to press home some of the decisions made\nat their pre-JURGO meet ir j the previous week.\nPresident Rex Lowin requested representation on\nthree college committees;\nthe Exploratory Committee,\nwhich considers policy items\nprior to discussion by the\nBoard of Studies, the Development Committee and\nthe successor to the Centenary Appeal Fund Committee. Lord Penney beat\nabout the bush and said he\nwould discuss the first two\nwith the relevant chairmen\nand consider the third when\na successor was found.\nRector Rules\nFrom there to the question of discipline, where\nCouncil had basically formulated three proposals:\nThe formation of a central\ndisciplinary committee, abolition of the idea of double\npunishment (e.g. punishment\nby college authorities of students already convicted in\ncourt) and abolishing the\nconcept of punishment for\n\" bringing the name of the\ncollege into disrepute.\"\nNothing concrete was de-cide d. The rector spun\nwords and certain council\nmembers failed to uphold\nthe collective decisions\nmade by council the week\nbefore. (See \"They Tell\nMe \" for further comment.)\nOther matters discussed\nby JUR GO included the\ngeneral situation regarding\nthe timetables of lectures\nand laboratory sessions for\nWednesday afternoons.\nSpecial reference was made\nto the Chemistry department which has, in the past,\nbeen notorious in this re-spec t. The Pro-Rector, Lord\nJackson, reported that Professor Ring (Infrared Astronomy) and Professor Cherry\n(Telecommunications) were\ninterested in the conference\non Teaching and Learning\nMethods, which would be\nheld at the end of the Easter\nterm.\nNon\u2014Event\nPenney closed the meeting swiftly without asking\nfor any other business, this\naction setting the seal on an\napparent unwillingness by\nthe administration to listen\nto the student points of\nview. If the administration\nwant to \" improve the\ngood name of the college \"\nas far as the decreasing\nnumber of prospective students goes, they should at\nleast lend a sympathetic ear\nto students already here.\nJURGO, it seems, is a non-event.

Proposals to alter the number of fresher s in Hall\nfrom the present level of 25 per cent to one of 50 per\ncent (425 places) have caused considerable discussion over\nthe last week or two.\nWhat, after all the fuss, are the facts ?\nLast May, Peter_ Mee, referred to the next U. G.M. Registrar to the College,\nsuggested the increase, on\nbehalf of the Admissions\nPolicy Committee, in the\nhope of checking the fall in\napplications for I.C. which,\nhe claims, is greater than for\nother Universities, because\nof a shortage of residential\nplaces. As reported elsewhere in FELIX, this was\nbrought up after an unexplained delay of 6 months,\non the part of the College,\nat the recent I.C. Union\nMeeting. However, amidst\nsome confusion, no decision\nwas reached. The final decision on whether to increase\nFreshers' places in Hall will\nbe made by the Student\nResidence Committee, on\nwhich only three students\nsit. The matter will not be\nThe Halls Rep. on Council,\n\" Spike\" Bantin, has been\ncollecting opinion from\nall quarters to put before\nthe Residence Committee.\nUnder this category comes\na motion passed by\nR. S.M.U. suggesting an increase to 35 per cent. However, the Committee has* already said that 50 per cent\nis an impracticable figure,\nand the Wardens have stated\nthat only a small increase\ncan be tolerated. Meanwhile, the number of\nFreshers in the new Student\nHouses has been provisionally set at one in six. At the\ntime of writing, it was hoped\nthat a final decision would\nhave been reached yesterday\n(see report in FELICITY).\nOthers matters decided by\nthe Residents' Committee at\nthe previous meeting are as\nfollows: -Residents in Student\nHouses will be pleased to\nknow that all rents have\nbeen reduced by 10/- per\nweek as from 1st October\nlast, and so everyone will be\ngetting a refund.\nDeficit\nHowever, a deficit of\n\u00a35,000 on Halls and Student\nHouses is expected by 1970,\nwhich will be met by an\nincrease in rents. One\nsuggestion is that Halls\nshould partly finance Student Houses in order, to\nbring rents more into line\nconsidering the type of accommodation offered.\nThe camp beds idea for\naccommodating overnight\n(male) guests in Southside\nhas been rejected after all\nWardens reported that there\nare unused guest rooms at\nweekends.\nMINES'\nBOTTLE\nSTOLEN\nThe much revered\n\"Match Bottle,\" held by\nR.S. M. as winners of the annual rugby match between\nthemselves and Camborne\nSchool of Mines, was stolen\nfrom its resting place behind\nthe Union bar last Thursday evening, presumably by\nstudents. Camborne and\nR.S. M. officials are shocked\nand surprised, as the bottle\nis not a mascot and of no\ncash value.\nAt about 9.30 p.m., the\nhead barman, Gus, turned\nround from serving at the\nfar end of the bar to see four\nstrangers removing the\ntrophy. He gave chase,\nshouting \" Stop thief,\" but\nnobody else lifted a finger or\neven lowered a pot to help\nhim. The raiders ran out to\na getaway car in Prince Consort Road, breaking a glass\ndoor panel in their haste.\nAlthough Gus was delayed\nwhen the thieves jammed\nthe double door outside the\nbar with a large knife, he\nwas just, in time to take\ndown the car number.\nAfter a999 call, two\npolicemen interviewed Gus\nand Mines President Barry\nSullivan in the bar, and an\n\" all cars\" alert was put\nout. The car was soon\ntraced to a Hertfordshire\naddress, but police refuse to\ngive this address or the cul-pr its' names unless Mines\nprosecute. However, this\nhas been decided against, so\nthe raiders remain anonymous. Going*\nto a dance?\nWe can fix you immediately\nwith modern S/B Dinner Suit,\nshirt, collar, bow, studs &\nshoes for 35/-.

    "content": "FELIX 11 December 1968 3\nTHEY TELL ME....\nJURGO\nThe first meeting of\nJURGO\u2014The joint UnionRectors-Governors Committee\u2014was held on Monday\nDec. 2nd. The chairman was\nLord Penney, former director of the Atomic Weapons\nResearch Establishment and\nnew Rector of Imperial College, and the main purpose\nof the meeting was to advise\nthe Governing Body on\ndisciplinary procedures in\nI.C.J UR GO is composed\nof the Rectors, ICU Council\nand three Governors and\nlike any sensible body of\nnegotiators ICU Council\nmet prior to the JURGO\nmeeting to discuss a pape i on discipline from the Governing Body. A number of\ndecisions were made and\nstands for the meeting a dop ted. It is clearly minuted by\nCouncil that one of the principles they would fight for\nwould be that nobody\nshould ever be punished\ntwice for the same offence.\nIt is probably one of the\noldest principles of English\nCommon Law that nobody\ncan ever be tried twice for\nthe same offence, and to\nhave this written into any\ncollege code of discipline\nwould be elementary natural\njustice, thus making it impossible for the Rector, or\nanybody, to try students on\ncharges which the police\nhad already taken up.\nSell-out\nUnfortunately, to Lord\nPenney such a principle\nwould undermine the right\nof the Governors \" to safeguard the good name of the\ncollege,\" and the Rector was\ndetermined that JUR GO should agree that the \" good\nname of the college\" was\nmore important than justice.\nANN SHEPHERD\nBy all accounts the Rector\nas chairman was prepared to\nsteam-roller his views\nthrough, and, in fact, his\ntask was made easier by a disgusting sell-out by certain\nCouncil members. Barry\nHood, Secretary of Mines,\nwho spent the relevant section of the Council meeting\nreading \" The Evening\nNews,\" (that well-known\npro-I.C.\" news\" paper),\nactually spoke in favour of\nthe double punishment. I.C. President, Rex Lowin, who,\nin contrast, we have always\nthought took his duties re-s pons i bly, also spoke for\ndouble punishment on certain occasions. Chris Kent\nand Lilas Campion are also\nsaid to have failed to stand\nfirm on Council's agreed de-c is ion. Two points thus arise\u2014if\nCarnival\nWalk\n189 students turned out\nfor the Carnival walk last\nFriday, and together raised\nabout \u00a31,000. Each walker\nwas sponsored for a certain\namount of money for each\nmile walked.\nThey set off with varying\ndegrees of keenness\u2014some\nran, some went straight\ninto the pub until closing\ntime. At Kingston (for the\nsecond time), which was 16\nmiles out, there was coffee\nwaiting, and back at college\na hot breakfast cooked by\nnone other than Mooney in\nperson awaited the walkers\nat the end of their 27 mile\ntrek.\nThe success of the event,\nwhich has raised a substantial part of Carnival's target\ntotal, mus f be attributed to\nMaggie Hymans and Paddy\nSterndale, the organisers.\nICA\nFluorescent\nChrysanthemum\nAn exhibition of modern\nJapanese art in many media\n\u2014sculptures, graphics, pos-ter s, music, visual scores\nand films. It is so called because the chrysanthemum is\nthe ancient Imperial symbol\nof Japan and many contemporary Japanese artists work\nwith fluorescent plastics and\npigments. Showing until\nJanuary 26th, this exhibition\nwill be reviewed by FELTX\nnext term.\nNote that ICA membership is closing for several\nmonths on 31st December.\nThere is a possibility of IC\nbecoming a group member\nof ICA\u2014watch out for further details if you are interested in joining.\nJUR GO is not a real consultative body but merely a rubber stamp to the Rector,\nas most of Council now seem\nto think, then it is even more\nuseless than we thought; if\nHood and Lowin, in part icu lar, are prepared to back\ndown on this issue, and allow IC to further punish\npeople that the law of the\n'and feels have been adequately punished, then the\nstudents at this college no\nlonger want them as their\nrepresentatives and they\nshould resign.\nft ft ft\nWaste\nPerhaps in the near future\nICU Exec will tell us how\nmuch has been lost on subsidies for the various Balls\nand Dances now run for the\nin-crowd. Many people\nthink that Ents profits could\nbe better spent than on\nfunctions such as the President's Dinner and Dance.\nAt this function, held on\nthe last Friday of the Summer Term, about \u00a3400 is\nspent by the President giving free tickets to those who\nhave helped him during the\nyear. The guests are divided\ninto two classes\u2014the five-pennies who receive a dinner\nticket and the four pennies who only receive a dance tic-ket, both double of course,\nMany in protest stay away\nand last \"year a number of\npeople made a more tangible\nprotest against waste and\n\" crony is m\" by giving the\nmoney they would have\nwasted on DJ's etc. to \" War\non Want.\"\nAll this has forced ICU Council to set up a sub committee to discuss the affair.\nIt consists of Jane Pearson,\nex-Con. Soc. Chairman Rex\nLowin, ex-Con Soc vice-Chairman, Keith Guy, another ex-Con. Soc. Chairman, Jeff Steer, Union\nDeputy President, Piers Corbyn and popular Vinod\nGarga. Piers and Vinod are\nfighting for the comprehensive rethinking of the D and\nD \u2014perhaps including it with\nthe May Ball to which all\nthe UL U Presidents are invited to consume free liquor.\nLowin, Steer and Pearson\nare basically opposed to\nchange whereas Guy would\nlike to make the whole affair more exclusive and take\nit to a private hotel.\nMaybe they will deign to\nconsult the ordinary Union\nmember before the tickets\ngo out this year, and then\nagain maybe they won't, as\nit is unlikely that ordinary\nmembers would support the\nidea of free beer for the\nbosses.\nLES EBDON\nAnnie or ad les Billy Hicks in the more realistic surroundings\nof a local churchyard.\nStrong Characters\nand Strong Language\nA review of last weeks' Dramsoc. Christmas P,v.. uc tion. Serjeant Musgrave's Dance is a play well suited to DramSoc's talents. It is about war, the men moulded by war\nand the unchanging reaction of ordinary people to war.\nStrong characters and strong language dominate and the\nunusual use of verse and ballads at critical moments is\nparticularly successful in the final prison scene. On the\nwhole a vital pace is kept up\u2014a slightly sticky patch de-ve lopes in the second aCt\u2014and the final \" dance is both\ngripping and chilling. The production did however lack\nany of the sense of history which Arden intended.\nIn a play with many different scenes, the sets were\nexcellent and the standard of acting generally good. Particular mention must go to Julian Robertson as a thoroughly\nconvincing Musgrave. Of the other parts, the colliers\nwere consistently sound and Roger Gift gave a spirited\nrendering of Joe the Bargee,\nThis was a very entertaining production\u2014worthy of\nmuch better support than it received on the Tuesday night.\nHow does your degree\nqualify you for a top job in industry?\nLet's be frank. It doesn't. But it is a most valuable start.\nYou may feel that there is a great gulf fixed between your University course\nand the sort of experience which leads to the highest positions in industry.\nIn a sense there is such a gulf and Unilever have taken steps to bridge it with\ntheir Unilever Companies' Management Development Scheme.\nThis Scheme is designed to develop management skills in graduates of all\ndisciplines and give them the training and opportunities to become the people\nwho will, in future, be able to undertake high level responsibility in\nUnilever Companies.\nIf you would like to know more about this Scheme, ask your Appointments\nOfficer for a copy of the booklet \"Careers in Unilever 1969\" or write to the\naddress shown below. This booklet is not a glossy graduate bait. It discusses\nfrankly, with examples from graduates who have recently joined Unilever,\nwhat happens when you join; your likely future career; your financial\nprospects; and even the reasons why some people leave (not many do\u2014but\njoining Unilever is not a life sentence!). It also tells you about the selection\nprocedure, and how you join the Scheme.\nThe minimum starting salary is \u00a31,200 for a first degree, and more for\nrelevant post graduate study or experience\u2014a Ph.D., for example, would\nstart at \u00a31,500.\nApply now to your Appointments Officer or write to:\nC.R. Stewart, Personnel Division, Unilever House, London, E.C.4. Unilever will be visiting your University during the\nSpring Term to interview students. Details of this visit\ncan be had from your Appointments Officer.\n\n"

Taking full advantage of their new facilities the\nSquash Club are going from strength to strength with a very\nactive membership.\nThe girls too, are having a steady season but are still\nlooking for new recruits now that the initial keenness has\nwaned a little.\nThe larger clubs are beginning to feel the strain of\nputting out several teams twice a week with injuries posing\nmany problems. Last week, no less than 7 of 1st XV were\nunavailable through injury, most of whom are our more\nexperienced players.\nThe 1st XI( Soccer) found themselves without a game on\nSaturday as their opposition, a neighbouring London\nCollege, decided that I.C. were just too good and that they\ndidn't want to be beaten 11-2 again\u2014quite a compliment!\nPride of place must of course go to the Cross Country\nClub, who, making full use of their abundant talent had\nthe U.L. Championships all sewn up despite extremely\ntrying conditions.\nGIRLS'SPORT\n- STEADY\nThis year so far the fortunes of I.C. W.S.C. have\nnot been as good as last\nyear.\nThe hockey team has won\nseveral matches but lacks\nthe overall shooting power\nthat it had last year. We had\na bye in the 1st round of the\nU.L. U. cup and our 2nd round match was rained off\nlast Saturday, so we can\nboast of no great successes\nyet. The newly founded\nswimming team has been\nunfortunate to have had\ncounter-attractions on at\nboth of its matches this term\nwhich have lured its star\nmembers. Given a full\nteam we could have a measure of success.\nThe squash team is still\ncompeting in the men's league with some success.\nBadminton is the game\nwhich seems most geared to\nour talents this year and\nboth the ladies and mixed\nteams have a100 per cent\nwinning record.\nTable tennis has two\nteams competing in the\nU.L. U. league, which, in\nspite of great promise have\nno wins under their belts.\nNetball and Judo are still\nseeking recruits to make\nthem quo rate and in fact\nany team captain will be\nhappy to see a new face.\nKeep-fit is held in the gym\nevery Monday evening and\nis followed by badminton\npractice. Squash coaching\nis held in the Sports Centre\nfrom 2.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. on Wednesday afternoons\nand swimming training on\nMonday from 6.30 p.m. and\nFriday from 6.00 p.m. FIFTHS HIT 6\nGuysII-2, ICV-4\nIC's debut ante full-back\nopened Guys' account after\nfive minutes when his back\npass left keeper Roswell\nstranded. Minutes later ICs twin-stopper Mountford ran\n30 yards to rob Guys'\ncentre-forward and slip the\nball past the advancing\nRoswell to put Guys further ahead.\nThe Fifth's forwards,\nhowever, were more erratic\nin their shooting and it was\nanother half hour before\nGunnell reduced the arrears.\nIn a thrill-packed second-half, IC pressed for more\ngoals. After 65 minutes\nDay bobbed up for the\nequalise r and our boys went\necstatic when Gunnell rose\nto head home a corner for\nthe third. Soon after, the\ncentre-forward completed\nhis hat trick.\nShortly before the end,\nbustling wing man Park was\nstruck by a Guys defender,\nwho was sent off for his\npains.\nTeam : S.. Roswell; D.

CHAMPIONSHIP\nThe University of London\nCross-Country Championships were held last Saturday at Parliament Hill Fields\nin extremely muddy conditions. After a fast start\nNick Barton and Norman\nMorrison of IC settled into\nfirst and second positions,\nwith St. George's Hospital\nand UC runners tucked in\nbehind them. The remainder\nof IC's runners were between twentieth and thirtieth.\nAfter the first lap of three\nmiles, Barton and Morrison\nwere clear leaders and Barry\nDobrowski, Ashley Deans\nand Tony Mason were\nworking their way up the\nfield endeavour ing to break\nthe St. George's and UC packs.\nNick Barton was first\nhome in 29 mins 33 sees;\nsecond was Norman Morrison i>30 mins 23 sees.\nNext in for IC were Barry\nDobrowski, 11th; Ashley\nDeans, 13th, and Tony\nMason 15th. The second\nteam also finished well up\nbeating Kings College first\nteam.\nThe previous Wednesday\nthe first team, having their\nbest season for many years,\nincreased their lead in the\nLondon League held at\nTrent Park. They now have\na lead of 45 points over\nBorough Rd. College. The\nsecond team are in sixth\nposition, just behind LSE I, and the third team are\neleventh in League II, although they finished seventh\nin this race. The main\nstrength of the IC team this\nyear is its depth. The second team are very keen and\nprovide a hard core of talented athletes from which\nto choose replacements- for\nfirst team injuries.\nNext term should see New\nZealand international Barry\nJones recovered from his\nheel injury. Having just\nmissed selection for the\nMexico Olympics, he will be\nvery keen to show good\nform and will make the IC\nteam a very hard one to\nbeat\nI.C. Extra l sts in action.\nVOLLEYBALL CLUB\nIN GOOD FORM\nLondon Regional League\nthis year; unfortunately affiliations had to be in before\nwe returned to college.\nNext term we hope to visit\nExeter and Southampton\nuniversities as we did last\nyear, and on our present\nform we stand a good\nchance of beating them\nboth. In the summer term\nwe shall again be entering\nthe Annual Simmarian Volleyball Tournament and\nhope to do one better than\nwe did last year and win the\nDivision Two Cup. We were\nrunners up last year.\nI hope members will continue to support the club in\nwhat promises to be our\nmost successful season yet.\nA. J. HOWARD Captain\nThe Volleyball club has\nhad an excellent start to the\nseason, having narrowly lost\nonly one match of the five\nplayed so far. Due to increased membership this\nyear, and sustained support\nof the club, we have been\nable to field a strong team\nresulting in easy wins over\nSouthgate Technical College,\nSt. Mary's College (two\nteams) and Gunners Volleyball Club. The Soviet Embassy has been the only team\nto beat us this season. If support of the club continues\nin its present way we hope\nto be able to run a second\nteam next term.\nAll the matches played\nhave been friendlies as the\nclub is not a member of the\nTHREE TRIES\nfor DEVANEY\nWestcambe Park 10 pts. I.C18 pts.\nThis was an excellent and well-deserved win by I.C., providing an encouraging end to this first half of the season.\nThe game was to have been played at Harlington, but as many pitches were unfit it was switched to the Park's ground which was even more unfit!\nThe Park started very strongly with some dynamic pass-ing, ruc king and running from their forwards. Close to half\ntime, I.C. found themselves 10 pts to 3 down\u2014two good\ngoals against a penalty, when the backs received some\nreally good posses ions; on Parks 10 yd s line; Keith Devaney\nwas put away on the right wing, rounding his man, and\nscoring an excellent try wide out.\nIn the second half I.C.'s superior fitness began to tell,\nand with their pack getting on top, the backs had a field\nday. Keith Devaney scored two more tries following good\n3/4 movements, Keith Heaton scored his customary\nopportunist try and Dave Bell too ploughed his way over\nafter good break by scrum half Rend Weisner. Ex B2 John\nSmithies and John Ballard kept a firm grip on the centre\nalthough J.B. perhaps need n't have gone as far as knocking himself out in the process.\nprogress\nSquash\nOver recent years, the\nsquash club has been in a state of decline despite increased numbers. The formation of a London University Squash League last year\nchanged this and IC now\nhas a record number of four\nteams, each playing at least\n20 league matches in the\nseason.\nWith the increased prospect of getting into a team,\nmembers have responded\nwith great enthusiasm and\nthe club has become one of\nthe most active sporting\nbodies; and the Wednesday\nafternoon coaching sessions\nhave proved quite success-ful.\nThis season the fixture list\ncontains about 110 matches,\nabout the same as last year,\nas against 36 for the previous year.\nA knock-out tournament\nwill be continued this year\nand there are hopes of a big\nladder competition. Also\nbeing arranged are squash\ntours of Cambridge and Oxford, taking two teams on\neach tour.\nWith interest running at\nits present high level, IC is\nwell on its way to becoming\nthe force it once was in London University Squash.\nDEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification ?\nExercise your own\ndiscrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\nreports\nBadminton\nThe first half of this season has been reasonably\nsuccessful for the club. Both\nthe men's first team and the\nmixed team have lost only\none league game each out of\nthe matches played so far;\nthe mixed team lost its first\nmatch of the season to UC5 \u20144; however, hope of winning the league still runs\nhigh.\nThe only representative\nfrom IC in the recent BUSF\nchampionship held at Crystal Palace was Lynne Beynon in Chem I. Lynne\nplayed very well and\nreached the quarter-finals\nin the Ladies singles, the\nsemi-finals in the Ladies\nDoubles and the last 16 in\nthe mixed doubles, an\nachievement well worth\nnoting.
