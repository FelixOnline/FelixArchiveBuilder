    "content": "FELIX\nPROFILE\nLes Allen - President of the\nImperial College Union - your elected\nleader and representative - what sort\nof man is he? I won't pretend that ray\nramblings will tell you, hut you may\ngather some idea.\nFive years ago he was a fresher\nat I.C. and was as bewildered as any of\nour fresher s today. He had been born\nand educated in London, and came here to\nstudy Physios.\nNow? - he is a research spec tros cop is t, married, and likely to be very\nbusy in thi3 coming year. This will be\nnothing new to him.\nDuring his College career his\nprincipal interests have been debating\nand dramatics. In both of these fields\nhe has excelled, playing the lead in many\nproductions, and being a member of the\nI.C. team which won the University of\nLondon Debating Trophy last year. During\nhis final year as an undergraduate he was\nChairman of the Social Clubs Committeea responsible position which has provided him with the administrative exp erie nm and the knowledge of the running of the\nUnion, to carry off his present position\nin his customary manner.\nHe hopes to have a little time to\nindulge in his extra-College pursuits -such as watching Millwall and Surrey play\ntheir respective games; enjoying what he\ncalls \"high-brow theatre and low-brow\nmusic\"; and fervently joining marches if they are in a good cause.\nfp j ted ident' t Lettei\nBefore it was known that the\nPhoenix\" would not be coming out aa\nplanned because of the Printing Dispute\nthe Editor of \"Phoenix* asked me to\nwrite a \"President's Letter\" suggesting\nthat I might like \"to tell the Union\nwhat it might expect to happen during\nthe oc n& ng session.\" That letter will not now be published, but it is that\ntheme that Io on3 id or the most profit-i iole to explore here instead.\n1 find it a difficult theme to\nwrite on because I myself would like to\nknow what is likely to happen. It is, of course, true that after many years oi\nintensive noise of destruction and creation of College buildings we are having\nthe pleasure of seeing some of the new\nbuildings opening. From the student\nviewpoint the most important of these\nis Weeks Hall which will increase the\navailable hostel accommodation consider-ably. The new Physios building will be\ncompleted and the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment will be changing its home.\nThe pneumatic drills will not be stilled though for many new buildings have yet\nto be started and further old ones des-troy ed. Everybody I know is keen that I \u00bbG> should have' ao lOs ely knit corporate\nlife with as many students in residence\nas possible. The presence of Weeks Hall\nwill, I believe, increase the population\nin the Union building during the even-in gs, for the more people there are li ving in College the more additional people\nthere are likely to be spending time\nwith them. Similarly the Physioists vacating the old R.C.S. building will find\nthemselves nearer the Union than Ayrton\nHall and willI suspect be changing their\neating and coffee venues. All of these\nthings to one extent or another will be\no hanging life at I.C. One thing is clear\nthat whatever may oc our during the coming\nyear things will not be standing still. Always there will be change. Will there\nbe in the activities of I. C.U?I have\nno idea for it is really up to Union members to decide.\nUnlike the older universities and\nthe older degree subjects, where lectures are few and the on u3 of reading is\non the student, Imperial College tends\nto be more rigid in that one has to go\nto a considerable number of lectures to\nsurvive from one year to the next. Consequently because of the nature of LC.\na student will acquire a university\neducation in a different way from those\nat Oxbridge. Indeed there is a danger\nthat he might not ao quire one at all. Io on fess that I have little time for\nchildish behaviour in students or for\nstudents where life is10 a. nu to 5 p.m. Neither of these attitudes is con duo ii m to a University education. I have in the past often felt that I.C. lacked an\nessential of a real University. It is perhaps a hard thing to pin down but\nbasically it is that the outlook is shallow and immature. One should not\nbe afraid to argue, to speak up, to\ndiscuss, to express a view, to listen\nand to think in a University. University should be the stamping ground of\nideas, beliefs and creations. They\nshould be trampled upon, agreed with,\nargued about, discarded, taken up, and\nchanged. But they must never be ign or ed. That is what I want to see at I.C.I do not honestly believe it exists at\nthe moment; but it should, and must.\nHow does one bring about that\nquality? I'm not entirely sure; such a feeling comes from deep inside those who want it. But a contribution o an be ne de to it at least by getting everyone interested in the Union. For everyone to\nmake the deo is ions of what they want in\nthe College. That is why I say I do not\nknow what the next year will bring. If it brings with it a3 e riou s outlook and\na thoughtful approach and active participation in Union meetings then I do\nnot doubt that much will oc our. It is though the Union who must decide not\njust Council or myself.\nHowever, to leave the hypothetical, one event wh i oh has been planned\nto oc our during the coming session is the I.C. Carnival. Instead of joining\nthe W.U. S. Carnival as during last ses s ion, I.C. will this year concentrate on\nits own Carnival for the first time. 3\nit hoped to raise money for o hari ty and\nfor an I.C. bed at St. George's hospital.\nApart from that and the already established events, the future is in your\nhands. My job as President as I see it is to help to guide your ideas to suo\u00bb\no ess ful conclusions. It o anI think be\na very fine year far I.C.

    "content": "FELIX RETROSPECT by E KIM The past year will not be recorded\nIn the annals of Imperial College as\ns truly outstanding, but nevertheless\nit was not a year without highlights.\nWe had a fine team of union officials,\nthat had several storms to weather\nduring the year; with the eloquent\nRichard \"Tiny\" Garnett as President,\nand his henchman John Bell as Union\nSecretary.\nOn nearly every Saturday of the\nsession there is a dance (HOP!) where\nafter paying the requisite sum you\ncan spend the evening dancing with the\nwomen of your choice. The band is usually very good providing music for\nboth \"he p cats\" and \"squares\". The\nquality of the women present is good,\nand the quantity sufficient. Each of\nthe three colleges also holds an\nEvening Dress Dance (don't be perturbed by the heading).\nBy now you are probably thinking\nthat college life is all beer and v omer, for here are a few extra our riou lar activities. The Dramatic Society\ngave a very polished performance of\nthe difficult Shakespeare production\n\"Taming of the Shrew\" and also had\nseveral play-readings during the ses-sion. ^Their trip to Northern\nIreland is reported in this edition).\nIt is probably apparent to you\nthat most of the activities that the\ncollege takes part in, usually have a string of superlatives attached.\nHost of the things we do are successful. It o an be argued, that\nthe men at the top are the ones that\ncount, but without support they could\nMISS C8.G MODELS FROM PARIS?\nIn the mascot field \"Boanerges\",\nthe City and Guilds 1901 James and\nBrown, affectionately known as Bo\n(not to be confused with a well known\nadverb) completed yet another successful Brighton Run, but has since ran\ninto mechanical trouble and ia at\npresent off the road. Whenever the\nbell of a fire-engine was he amd in\nthe neighbourhood of the college you\noo ul d reckon on it being something to\ndo with R.C.S. Either they had\nblown yet another hole in their building or else, they were giving their\n1916 Dennis Fire Engine, \"Jesebel\"\natrial outing. The third member of\nthe heavy brigade, the R. S.M.'a tractor engine \"Clementine\" has\nunfortunately contracted boiler trou-ble. As these three vehicles\nwould be rather awkward to carry\nabout, each of the constituent colleges has a smaller more manageable\nmascot. Mines with a Hiohelin man,\n\"MitoH\"; the R.C.S. has an out s is e thermometer (not to be confused with\nthe proverbial daffodil!) named\n\"Theta\"; and Guilds who have an\nout six e spanner - this was last heard\nof in the vicinity of Snowdonia, and\nwas the highest object south of the\nborder.\nDuring the term the College\nacquired several ether college mascots,\nranging from the N.E.C. \"Carrot\",\nto the Unicorn from Bedford (which was\nchristened Raphael during a Guilds\nUnion meeting). The fresher must\nnot think that all such\"raids\" are\nsuccessful, the Sandhurst Cannon still remains at the R.H.A. after several\nattempts.\nIn the fresher s early days at\nI.C. he will -wv a cub ted ly hear the word\n\"Carnival\" uttered. Some say the\nword with awe; some with knowledgeable for boding; most with pure lust.\nA Carnival is what YOU make it. Last\nyear R.C.S. commenced the revelry with\n\"CUBANTICS\". ' A lively carnival it was spoiled by the persist ant attention\nof gate crashers. The cabaret was\ngood, but contained humour of a little too coarse a nature. Guilds \"Pirates\nParadise\" was perhaps the finest ex.'triple of coordinated planning that\nthe College has seen. The idea of\nconverting the Concert Hall in td a pirate galleon filled even the greatest pessimists with doubt, but on the\nday they proved a credit to designers\nand bul der s. The o abaj set was\nextremely talented, and despite\nR.C. S.int eruptions( Jealousy maybe!)\nput over a very good performance.\nWith Mines Carnival \"Me and My Ghoul\"\nlack of support did not make it the\nsuccess that it might have been.\nDue to enforced police regulations\nI.C. celebrated Nov. 5th, as at other\nyears, with a bonfire and firework\ndisplay at the sports ground at Harlington. Although the firework display oo ul d have been organised a little better, and despite the\n\"Moon Shot\" failure, the dancing and\nother forms of entertainment were\nenjoyed by all. I am pleased to\nreport that the three policemen who\nwere admitted to hospital, have all fully recovered.\nnot manage it. Remember this, for it is one facet of the Union that,is\nsometimes sadly lacking. We have\nthe men and women who have made this\nCollege what it is, but this record\noo ul d be improved with support:\nWUS CARNIVAL\nwhether this means spending a few\nshillings to listen to a mediocre\nperformance, or standing watching an\nI.C. team in action, the very fact\nthat you are there will help the participants no end. Other highlights\nof the year were the \"I.CU. L.U\" organised W.U. S. Carnival, and the\nelection of Mr. ICWA, an honour wh i oh finally befell Mr. Tony \"Tub\" Ewart.\n\n"

Unfortunately, owing to the\namount of timber w Li oh had been used\nin building ships for the Carthaginian\nWar which had just ended, the rostrum\nwas shorter than usual. The Tribune of\nthe Flabs p ioke d himself up, remounted\nthe platform, and commenced, \"Civites\"\n(because \"aiv ites\" was the usual way of\naddressing Roman citizens). \"I have an\nannouncement to make.\" (Which was rat hex superfluous as everything else was made\nby slaves). \"A huge sp eot acul umi( neuter) is going to be held in the Circus Pioadilla.\" (Which was a less not-or ius spot than the Circus Mauimi Ha). \"Festivities will take place for fifteen\ndays Soman Summer Time.\" Loud cheers\ngreeted this as up till then it had been\nvery doubtful if there would be any sum-mer time.

Also in S. America, three zoologists have been making\nfilms and sound recordings of the\nfauna of British Guiana Zoologists\nwere also active in the Jhteres\nwhere nine underwater swimmers were\nstudying the fauna and geology in the\ncoastal waters of Teroeiva island.\nIn the Mediterranian, ten botanists,\nzoologists and geologists worked on a small Greek Island not far from\nAthens. In the colder regions a small geological party worked in the\neast of Iceland, and four I.C. men\njoined up with four geologists from\nBirkbook College to visit Jan May en\nwhich was visited by an I.C. expedition just before the war.\nArticles by members of these\nexpeditions will appear in later\nissues ef 'Felix', and tile Exploration Society will be arranging illustrated lectures.\nThe Exploration Board i a a joint College and Unwin organisation\nto which all proposals for I.C. expeditions must ba submitted.

The first day waa\ntaken up in speeches and Cicero would\nhave revelled in verbosity had he been\npresent. Unfortunately he could not\nmake it as he was not born at the time.\nNothing daunted, the people\nflocked from ail over Rome for the\nstart of the seo on d week's proceedings\nand they were- not disappointed. The\nshow recommenced with jugglers, performing bears, close-harmony singers and a curly-haired \"so at* a in ger, especially\ncaptured in America far the ocoa a ion, by\nname - Daanlus Cains, He was a great\nsuccess, which o a a aed some concern\namongst the proprietors of the Coliseum,\nwho were putting an \"Me Osoulare, Kate.\"\nThe next four days were taken up\nwith parlour games suo h as throwing\nheretics, slaves, suffragettes, etc.,\nto the lions. Many people shuddered at\nsome of the horrible sights and one small\nchild who was aB.C. minor, was heard to\ncry, \"Oh, look at that poor lion, who\nhasn't got a Christian to eat.\" So saying he rushed into the lion's mouth and\nquite disgusted that beast with his\nexhibitionism. Finally, with customary\nRoman \"sang froid,\" he killed him i a sold blood.\nNext came the Gladitoriel show.\nAt one point the great Spartaous triumphed over his rival and appealed to\nthe mob. They wished him to administer\nthe death blow, but as the vanquished\n\u2022as good looking the Vestal Virgins turned\nS their thumbs as a sign that he should\nspared. Spartaous also made a sign\naccording to customary ritual, to show\nhis opinion.\nThe week ended with a spectacular\nfi jg ht between some of Pyrrhus' elephants\nand some African ones. The sight would\nhave cheered the heart of Cecil B. de\nMille (especially as the Baths oo ul d be\nseen from the arena) but it was brought\nto a rather unseemly end by the appearance of a mouse. The elephants fled\nleaving the mouse in sole possession of\nthe sandy floor.\nThe great finale came on the fifteenth day. Thousands of dancers danced\nto hot rhythm played by a frio an slaves,\nand the mob were allowed to participate\nin oom mun cal singing. They sang all their favourite tunes, including the No.\n1 Hit, \"Our Soldiers Went to War.\"\nThus ended-the first festival on\nrecord. It was an immense success, oost\nthe Senate millions of s ester ces, and\nensured their suo o ess at the next General\nElection.\nHALDANE LIBRARY Have you ever heard of the rTa lft a a i a Library? Most people haven't. The\n\u2022Id Union Library, wh i oh consisted\nmainly of fiction, has been greatly\nenlarged daring the last nine years\nwith the aid of generous grants from\nTouchstone. These have been primarily\ndevoted to reinforcing the non-fiction\nsections, and as a result the college\nnew ios s esse s a balanced collection to\nsuit every conceivable taste. Housed\nin 13 Princes Gardens and renamed after\na distinguished member of the oo lle ge, the late Lord Haldane, the library\nawaits to amuse arid to educate. It is now under the control of a joint\naom mitte e ef students and staff with\nstrong financial support from both\noo lle ge and Union. Mr. A.G. Quinsee,\nB.A., F.I.A. is the full-time librarian\nand the hours of opening\n11 _ 5,30 en Mondays, Wednesdays\nand Fridays and until 7 P>m* \u00b0\u00b0Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nEvery conceivable Interest is catered for. The following typify\nthe type of reading that the Haldane\nLibrary offer to students. 'A Treasury of Ribaldry' ed. by L. Untermeyer, or on a slightly more sophisticated plane, the complete works of\nArthur Miller and Eugene O 'Neill.\nFor the tongue-tied, 'English Love\nPoems' may provide some assistance, as\nmight that best-selling collection of\nAmerican Folklore - 'The Kinsey Report'\n- albeit a little ragged at the edges.\nAmong the seemingly unending\nstream of war-books, 'Arnhea' by Major\nGeneral Urquahart is noteworthy, as\nis 'Hitler's Youth' by Franz Jetzinger.\nIf you prefer to take your science\nfrom the 'Tele', Patrick Moore's 'The\nAmateur Astronomer' will be familiar.\nThe series on the History of Technology is, surprisingly enough, worth\nbrowsing Into, and Herman Oberth'a \u2022Man into Space' makes absorbing\nreading.\nFor those interested in hob bie a, ether than the above, 'The Art of\nCricket' by Bradman is vastly superior\nto the efforts of Lon and Dennis;\n'The Focal Encyclopaedia of Photography' , a 'Sailing Premier' by W.D. Fork and the 'Logical approach to\nChess* by Blaire and Rumble are also\nrecommended.

    "content": "FELIX a STAGE BY THE SEA being an account of ay visit to Northern Ireland with the\nDramatic Society*\nJU 0. Boss.\nIt was a Saturday morning; one\nof those mornings when the body instinctively o all s for another ten min-ute s\" in bed. The air was grim with\ndrizzling grey ness and the o old of\ndawn still clung to every building.\nAfter dispelling most of the lethargy\nwith a cup of black coffee and a couple\nof fried eggs disposed around a piece\nof burnt toast, I set off for the outskirts of London. Barnet seemed a good\npoint to start from and, sure enough,\nI was soon rolling across the oom for tr able low oo un try side of Southern England in a large, slow, but steadily\nmoving lorry. Prom Leicester to Loughborough I got a lift in a nippy little van, which lapped up the roads in as\nlight and chatty a manner as the driver\nlapped up the details of my identity. A Jaguar took me in comfort through the\nverdure of the Derbyshire Dales and the\nPeaks to Manchester, from the lush\ngreens to,the greys and dirty ochre s of\nthis large .industrial, spread. Again it rained. I took refuge this time with\nBritish Railways and, for the usual nominal fee, I travelled by train to Heysham, boarded the steamer, and waited\nfor the rest of the party to arrive. We\nconstituted the advance party of the\nDramatic Society's summer tour to Portrush, Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland.\nIt was a smooth trip across the\nIrish Sea and the light of morning found\nus coasting down Lough Belfast. Slipping past a granary, a power station, a retinue of cranes and ship-building\nyards, all spidery against the sky in construction but massive in concept, we\nfinally entered Belfast City. After a long journey right across Antrim-Ballymena,\nBallymoney, Ballybogy, - wo collapsed\nthankfully into the sitting room of our\nhost and hostess with thoughts Of the\nflats and props which were following us\nonly nebulous ly in our minds. Our mouths\nwere filled with ham s and wi o he s, our\nglasses with Irish whiskey, our bodies\nwith travelling tiredness and our minds\nwith vague happiness when a small calm\nvoice carried with it the momentarily\nshattering news that our flats, already\npainted and prepared, were too big for\nthe stage by a mere two foot. A curs-e ry examination of the stage however\nsoon showed that, although it was unthinkable to shorten the flats, we oo ul d raise the roof. Meanwhile sleep, beautiful sleep.\nPortrush, like many sea-side\nresorts, is an ugly conglomeration of\nlarge boarding houses, noisy amusements and quaint public buildings. The\ntown hall, wh i oh was als'o the theatre\nand the centre of many religious meetings,\nis a quaint squat red brick building with\na dumpy round tower of the wi to he s hat\nvariety, and across the road the railway\nstation stands out, white and black al most imitation Sudor, resembling anything\nbut a railway station. Amusement arcades\nare as much a feature of Portrush as theatres are of London, but the various fruit\nmachines to be found in them were not\ndesigned to stand up to the rig ours of\nthe Scientific Method as taught at\nImperial College. During our stay it ins\nnot uncommon to see a frustrated change\nattendant mounting guard in his little kiosk, refusing to accept h \u00abnd fulls of\npennies in exchange for silver, or a bevy\nof tiny tots watching, mouths agape, at\nthe torrent of pennies initiated by the\ndelicate touch of our experts.\nI cannot resist mentioning the\nso as tal scenery of Antrim, despite the\nrisk of turning this a ooo unt into a travel agency brochure. Aroung the harbour the rocks provide shelter for a wonderful garden of sea--weeks, lazy\ngreen strands, exploding tufts of brilliant green and huge wafting sheets of\ntough tubb er brown. To the east a white\nstrand, stretching straight between the\never rolling waves of the ocean and the\nrising rolls of sand-dunes, is finally\nterminated by an outcrop of limestone.\nThe oli ffs rise steeply from a microcosm of rook-pools and sharp beds of\nmussels and limpets. Further east still, the Giants Causeway, a massive rook y storybook re oo un ting intrigues and romances of an age when angry giants scooped\nout the land of Ireland and hurled it at\nSootland. We sat around the only seven\nsided stone, the removal of which, the\nguide books would have us believe, would\nallow the whole Causeway to collapse.\nAmongst the columns of this massive basaltic structure we found the giants chair,\nthe wishing well and countless other\nsuggestive structures. We found also a melee of shacks defiling the scenery in a way of which only Homo sapiens is cap-able. Buy your genuine Causeway rock,\nyour Irish shillelagh, your lick y sham-rock, postcards, ices and fizz here J So back to the production, flats\nto paint and touch up, a tomb and a balcony to construct, furniture to be\nfound and a roof to raise. Looking for\nthe furniture introduced us to some of\nthe seo on d hand furniture dealers of\nCoirsine. One entered a building which\ncan only be described as a cross between a farm yard and a large ware-house\nin which the moth and dust have ruled\nfor many years. If it is raining these\nplaces provide shelter for many a wandering family, and mother manoeuvres baby\nand pram amongst the thread-bare furniture keeping a sharp eye open for the\nvery occasional bargain.\nWednesday night and, no sooner had\nthe final curtain fallen on Noel Coward's \"Blythe Spirit\", than our stage crew were\non, tearing the stage to pieces like a lot of termites.- The next evening was\nto be the first night of our own prod-uc tion, Terence Rattigan's double bill of \"Harlequinade\" and \"The Browning Version\". Thursday was a day of mixed emotions for all of us, feelings of failure,\nof oblique tiredness, feelings of oom ple te loneliness, of frustration and annoyance,\nbut finally the relaxed feelings of success of perfection, but something that\nlay in the joy of achievement. The humour of \"Harlequinade\" might have been a shade too deep for the average Portrush\nholiday maker, or perhaps they were too\npolite to laugh, whatever the reason it was very obvious that a lack of audience\nparticipation was having a profound\neffect on the cast. Mike Spence, the\nproducer of this piece, recognised the\nsymptoms and successfully cured the disease by allowing his original production,\nto take on a somewhat elastic nature.\nThe emotions of \"The Browning Version\",\nhowever, certainly left the stage and\nwere received by the audience in a suspended silence which, though occasionally broken by the crash of a falling\npop-bottle> I shall always remember.\nPortrush had become a familiar\nplace, a friendly place and it was easy\nnow to find its charms, to feel the\nwarmth that one as so oia tes with that\nnebulous term humanity. But the time bad\ncome to break; another group to take the\nstage, another group watching the boxoffice eagerly we looming the sale of One\nmore ticket, not for the price of that\nscrap of paper, but for the knowledge\nthat one more seat ha3 been filled in that great void to which every actor\nplays his part.\nPROFILE\nHilary has been educated at several girls High Schools, in Bristol,\nNottingham, and Luton. It was during\nher stay at Luton that her ability to\nwield a hockey stick, on the field, was\nnoticed; and as a result she played for\na Bedfordshire Junior XI.\nIn '57 Hilary, tired of the\nrar if i ed atmosphere of a Girls High\nSchool, came to read Botany at I.C.( it is rumoured that she spent several months\ngrowing fungicide in order to become\nacc lim at is ed). Maintaining her high\nstandard of hockey it was not long before she became a regular member of the\nU. L.U.1st XI, and followed this by being selected for the united U.L. U. and\nCambridge team.\nOn the homely side, she has a love\nfor embroidery, playing the piano, and\nreading (she also enjoys driving the\n\"Family Rolls\", when Daddy says so). All in all she has all the fine qualities\nthat rate her suited far her present\npost. In a post-election speech she\nannounced her intention of putting I. CJ6A.\nwell and truly on the map, we wish her\nluck.\nHer sporting prowess has been\nmuch appreciated by I.C. W.S.C, and not\nrestricted to hockey she has also taken\npart in netball, tennis, swimming, and\neven croquet matches! She has held the\nposts of Secretary of I.C. W.S.C. and\nalso, the Natural Nistory Society. It\nwas whilst in the former rule that she\nhelped make the women's athletics team's visit to Delft, the success that it was.\nDon't imagine that Hilary is a \u2022\nbustling, efficient, battle axe, sports-woman. She is a pleasant, easy person,.\nand most attractive. Unfortunately she\nfails to discuss her romances (which arc reputed to be enormous) even with XWArianswhich is a wise policy.^ PETAPH ON AN OLD HOSTEL BED.\nOh bed that took a great delight,\nIn keeping me awake at night,\nI hope the god of beds gives thee,\nE 'en su oha rest as thou gov'st ma.\n\n"

    "content": "8 FELIX ATHLETIC TOUR OF GERMANY On Sat. Juno 20th the I0A0 departed from Victoria on a four tenn day\ntour of Germany. The after effects of\nthe President's Ball held on the previous night were apparent on at least\nfive members of the par fer who staggered\nbleary eyed from train to boat to train\nin quick succession. The party travelled through Germany in two mini-buses\nwhich proved an enormous success through\ntime saved and added convenience.\nThe first match was a triangular\nfixture between Manheim University,\nManheim Glub and 10 resulting in the\nnarrowest of victories to the Club with\n77 points followed by the University\n(76) and IC (75). Curtis (lO0m), Ludlum\n(400m), Smith (B3J) and Connolly (Jav.)\nall won their events whilst Collins did\nwell to finish second in a very fast\n1500m. After spending two days ih Manheim the party travelled on to Heidelburg for probably the toughest match\nof the tour. Here we lost the match by\nanother narrow margin despite fine\nsprinting by Curtis and Ludlum. The stay\nin Heidelburg proved to be delightful.\nVisits were paid to the local beauty\nspots as well as the famed night clubs.\nA party held in our honour proved an\nenormous success though some of the party\nwere still groping for form.\nWhilst at Heidelburg the team\ntravelled to Maintz to compete in an\nopen meeting with competition drawn from\nthe U.S. forces in Germany, Nottingham U. Maintz and IC. Dave Smith won the HSJ\nwith a leap of 14.04m and Curtis was the\nwinner of the 100m. Briggs was runner\nup in both the 1500m and the 3000m whilst\nLudlum was unlucky to be left in his\nblocks in a faulty 400 start. After the\nmeeting the team taught the US forces\nmany new ballads and lyrics that they had\nnot previously heard. During a subsequent\nvisit to Maintz we spent a most enjoyable\nday with Nottingham University on a coach\ntour organised by our hosts through some\nof the most beautiful Rhine, valley country.\nDave\nSmith was another consistent competitor\nand won three out of four HSJ's. His\njump of 14,04m at Maintz was well up to\nthe national standard. Tony Aloock performed entertainingly in the throwing\nevents whilst an out of form Colin\nConnolly offered grimmer resistance to\nthe German supremacy. Graham Tilly and\nLionel Pillinger comp le it md the middle\ndistance team running methodically and\nnever failing to complete the allotted\ndistance.\nFinally the athletic part of the\ntour finished with a visit to Marburg,\nprobably one of the finest University\ntowns remaining. The match resulted in\na safe victory to the hosts by 71 to\n54 points. Curtis (200m), Ludlum (400m) Smith (HSJ) and Briggs (1500m)all won\ntheir events whilst Curtis and Smith\nfinished second in the 200 m, and high\njump. Collins repeated Brigg3' unique\ni ou ble by finishing runner up in the\n1500m and 3000m. This was the first IC tour for\nmany years and was of necessity experimental in many respects. One of the\nmost important points to be made was\nthat peak fitness should be reached by\nthe second match of the tour. The\nstrongest fixtures should then be in the\nmiddle with the first and last treated\nas warming up and finishing matches.\nWEST COUNTRY\nANNIHILATED\nEmulating that great seaman and\nrenowned duck hunter, Sir Francis\nDrake, the I.C. Swimming Club again\nwent west this year- with a vengeance.\nLacking that eminent bob ber from\nWogga-Wegga, Mr. William Maemillan,\nwho was struck down with Kensington\nBush, fewer, the I.C. contingent set\nforth on safari for Plymouth and all points west.\nThe first match was\nsomething of a catastrophe, the\nLymington team beating I.C. by the foul\nmethod of scoring 16 more goals than we\ndid. By a tremendous effort we only\nlost to Weymouth by 5 goals to 3. At\nWeymouth we stayed in a pub and imbibed enough beer to beat Bridport\n6-1 next day. The next match was\nagainst Fowey, where the ball could\nonly with difficulty be separated from\nthe jellyfish. Several of these\ncreatures stung the goalkeeper, Mr.\nBrian (\"Fatso\") Hart, and paid a dire\npenalty for their temerity.\nAfter\nmore beer and a little sleep, the team\nproceeded to Saloombe, where an\nastounding victory was achieved by\n10 goals to nil. The shook was too\ngreat, the next game was lost to Brixham by the odd goal in seven. An\nattempt was made to blame this defeat\non the absence of the I.C. captain,\nMr. Roger Harford, who had left to\nplay far Hertfordshire on the Minor\nCounties Championship.\nThe tour ended\non a note of triumph with a victory\nover Brittania Royal Naval College by\n7 - 1. The dor mobile was driven\nthroughout by Mr. Roy Basham, and Mr.\nWilliam Lampard, however, strangely\nenough no injuries or accidents were\nrecorded. Taken all in all a good\ntime was had by everyone except the\nFowey jellyfish.\nJ.C. SOCCER\nI.C. Soccer Club extends greetings\nto all freshmen and welcomes back old\nlags who managed to pull strings with\ntho Board of Studies. This year we\nare running seven teams,again playing\ntwice a week on Wednesday and Saturday\nafternoons, so whatever your standard\nwe o an fit you in. We are also\ndetermined to retain the U.L. Cup which\nwe won last year with a side including\nfive freshmen, so don't miss the Trials\nat Harlington on October 7th and 12th. The club like so many others in I.C. has a very high reputation to maintain\nand with your help and enthusiasm we\nshall hold our place as the premier\noo lle gein the University.\nD.F. During this tour we reflected all the British weakness in the field events\nand could only muster one victory in the\nthrowing events over the whole tour. On\nthe track there was a happier picture.\nCurtis ran most consistently in the 100m and 200m, and never failed to record at\nleast one victory per match. Ludlum\nshowed no signs of a hard season and set\nup a personal best time of 50.0 sec over\nthe 400m. Sub 50 sec should be only a matter of time now. The IC captain Pete\nRayment never realised his potential\nover the 800 though Paul Clifton found\nthe speed that has eluded him throughout the earlier season and recorded a personal be3t time of 2:1.6 at Marburg.\nBriggs and Collins formed a formidable\ncombination over the middle distance\nraces and in taking first two p lao es in the 1500m at Marburg they gave the best\nteam performances of the tour.\nSQUASH\nThe Club welcomes new members,\nespecially beginners. The following\nmeetings have been arranged.\nFRESHER'S TRIAL, Wednesday, Oct* 7 th,2.00. CLUB TRIAL, Thursday, Oct. 8th,5.30. at the Squash Courts.\nThe courts are situated behind\nChe Aero and Chem. Eng. building.\nThe Club has a large competitive\nsquash program again this season with\nover 40 matches to be played. Subsidised coaching can be arranged if it is supported, and concessions axe given to\nthe Club at leading London Sports Stores\nSKI CLUB\nThe Club has two main activities:\n1) To train and enter a team for the\nUniversities Ski Championship.\n2) An annual skiing party for all grades\nof skiers, especially beginners. This\nparty is arranged at very favourable\nrates.\nMembership i3 open to all members\nof I.C. Union, and their friends are\nwelcome for the vacation.\nThis year the Club will be staying at Saas Fee in Southern Switzerland.\nWe shall be leaving On December 29th, the ba sio cost being \u00a329.10s.0d.
