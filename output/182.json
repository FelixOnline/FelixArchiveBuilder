    "content": "1 0 FELIX\nRUGBY SOCCER\nIC OUT OF THE GUTTERIDGE CUP\nOn Wednesday October\n21st. the IC Cup side turned\nout at Harlington to fulfil what\nhas almost become an established annual function\u2014the\nfirst round of the UL Cup competition vs. CEM. There was\nonly one change in the IC\nteam, involving a reshuffle of\nthe back row to include Foster\nin place of Rjavno, who was\nnot available-Having won the competition\neight times in the past eleven\nyears, and figured in the final\nfor the past five years, the IC\nside could be said to be confident of success.\nAs is usual on these oc-cas ions, CEM brought along\nwith them about 150 fanatical\nsupporters, whereas those from\nIC, de spit th\u201e inducements of\nfree return transport, could\nbe counted on. the fingers of\none hand.\nThe start of the game was\ndisaster o us from the IC viewpoint and in a short time- CEM had an 8 point lead which\ncan only be described as a gift. These 8 points were from\na goal which resulted from an\ninterception b vaC EM centre\nfrom, well within bis nv n half,\nand at rv brought about by\nla misunderstanding between\nthe IC left wing and full back\nabout a diagonal pint to the\nIC line. There was a a nick reply to this tr v. as if IC were\ngoing to shake off their complacent attitude, in which a concerted move down th\u00ab rie ht wine brought a try b v Butler\nwhich Molan converted.\nBy now, the teams had\nsettled down and it was possible to make como a riis on s The CEM side looked well\ndrilled and fit with ou showing\nan v individual shine, except\nat fly hi alf. where plenty of use\nwas made of some polished\nkicking to gain ground.\nThe IC side looked powerful and alwa vs potentially\ndangerous with the rack playing well, particularly in the\nfront row, where the experience of Wronski was proving in-valuable. A penalty awarded\nagainst IC late in the first half,\nsome would sav a little unfair-ly, for not playing the ball\nafter a tackle, meant that IC\nstarted the second (half trailing\nCEM11 points to 5.\nFor the bulk of the second\nhalf, IC occupied their op-pon ent's half with several attempts eoin e desperately close\nto scoring. However, a lead is\nn always easier to hang on to\nthan to make, so at no side,\nthe score had only moved to\n11\u20148 through a fia rly easy\npenalty kicked by Mol an. And so it was a slightly\nbewildered IC side that trooped off the field amongst the\nthrong of jubilant CEM supporters still unable to realise\nthat they had actually lost.\nSWIMMING\nGuilds Narrow Favourites\nOnce again the day of the IC Swimming Gala is drawing near.\nThis year, due to the unfortunate\nattitude taken by the UL U authorities towards certain occur-en ces connected with the event\nlast year, the gala will be held at\nthe Marshall Street Baths (near\nOxford Circus) on Friday, 30th November at 8 p.m. On the\nadvice of certain other authorities\ncoaches have been laid on to\ntransport spectators to and from\nthe baths, the coaches leaving\nfrom the constituent College en-trances.\n.. All the events promise to be\nclosely contested with Guilds appearing to have a slight edge;\nMines, we are told, have been\nreceiving lessons in the gentle art\nof all-in wrestling at secret hideout in Fulham, no doubt to get\nin trim for the water polo.\nAmong the other interesting\nevents, there is the Presidents'\nrace (tow ropes and all forms of\njet propulsion forbidden) and a surprise challenge race between\nRobin Claridge representing the\nBoat Club and Paul Morris of the\nSwimming Club\u2014-value to the\nwinner\u2014three more pints.\nCompetition Events :\n100 yd s. freestyle.\n100 yd s. backstroke.\n100 yd s. breaststroke.\n100 yd s. butterfly.\n1 length freestyle.\n4 x1 length medley relay.\n4 x1 length freestyle relay.\nWater Polo (3 matches).\nYour support will be most we l come, especially if . . . size 32.\nEditor's Note : Rumour has it\nthat there is a plot afoot to finish\noff the evening with a quiet pint\nor two in the UL U bar. We asked\nthe Swimming Captain about it,\nbut he denied all knowledge of\nany such plan.\nWhat is known for certain\nis that a fine night is expected\nin the IC bar, as darts match-es, yards of ale, extensions\netc. are being laid for that\nevening.\nSQUASH RESULTS. IC1s tV beat St. Edmund Hall, Oxford 5-0 (Home).\nI C1st beat London Hospital\n5-0 (Away).\nThe Soccer Club has recently manoeuvre d itself through a very\ndifficult fortnight. The mid-term climate seems to have affected\nus in two ways, making it difficult on one occasion for the usual\nseven or eight teams to take the field. Several opaque-eyed players\nhave been wandering off with grunts of \" Must see the woman,\" and\nthe greasy grounds have recently caused a large crop of other injuries.\nOn Saturday, 10th November, the first two teams made the trip\nto Leicester ; and although being beaten 0-1, the 1st XI managed t shake itself out of its apathetic approach to the game. We were hit\nby an injury at 1.30 a.m. next\nmorning. The coach broke\ndown, we didn't know where, and\nat that time passing cars didn't take too kindly to 22 cold, wet\nstudents. We passed the time by\ngetting cramp in turn until a relief coach arrived at 4.0 a.m. Everyone had recovered by the\nfollowing Wednesday, the 1st XI beating U.C.2 \u20141 and the 2nd XI, beating U.C.(11)3 \u20141, both\nat Shenley. (I shall merely remark that the coach broke down\nagain).\nAfter a run of exhausting\naway trips, the spirit of the teams\nis at last improving. The ' Stroud\nSchool' had half finished a Rubber when the Captain peered into\nthe coach for Winchester on the,\nwet morning of Saturday, 17th November. It was still raining\nwhen we lined up against 11 large\nphysical education a lists. After\nfifteen minutes Martin Bellett\n(goalkeeper) was taken off with\na cut head and his place taken\nby Dave Loftus. At first the ten\nmen faltered and were immediately one down. The long, uphill\nfight then began and every man\nchased and tackled with such\nzest that I.C. were soon in con-tro l.At this crucial stage we\ndeserved the stroke of luck that\ndeflected the ball off a defender\ninto the opponents' goal. The\nsecond half showed a resumption\nof the same pattern of play. The\ntwo wingers (Andy Batcup, Mike\nCox) were tackling like wing-halves and the rest of the lads put\nin a tremendous amount of work.\nEven Eddie was sweating. The\nwinning goal came from a difficult cross by Mike Eastell for\nCox to head the ball high into\nthe net. The two pairs of ' Wellingtons ' on the touch line (later\ndiscovered to be ' The Austins')\nstill had enough voice to help us\nmaintain this position.\nN. B.I.C.6 th XI. Played 9,\nWon 9. Goals 47\u201410.\nLATEST IC 1st11 drew 1-1 against\nQMC in the first round of the\nUniversity Cup. Reply is on\nSaturday at Harlington.\nSUPPORTERS WANTED\nATHLETICS\nI.C. retains Relays' Cup\nOn Wednesday, 14th November, I. C.A.C. took part in the\nU.L. Relays and Field Events\ncompetition, having won the Relays' Cup for the last two years.\nWe again managed to win, beating U.C. by 16 pts. to 14, incidentally giving I.C. its 1st cup\nof the season. This was due\nmainly to a surprise win in the\n4 x110 relay, J. Harrison starting\nand J. Smith anchoring, both\npulling out fast performances for\nthe cold conditions and wet track.\nTh\u00abse two also ran away from the\nother colleges in the 220 x220x440 relay giving J. Wood a15 yd.\nlead at the start of the quarter\nleg, and ensuring a no then win in\n137.8 sees. In the last relay I.C., weakened by the absence of P. Clifton, came in 3rd place behind\nU.C. and St. Mary's.E, Wilkins\n(4 mins. 2C) had a hard run but\ncould not quite catch J. Farringdon (4 mins. It), and American\nfresher Steiglitze (St. Mary's)(4 mins. 20).\nOn field events we were not\nquite so successful, missing a chance to win because of the\nprior commitments of some of\nour athletes. However, fresher\nW. Stabler (10ft.6 Pole Vault)\nW. Martin (140ft. Javelin) and\nWilliams (Discus), Turner (Jav.)\nand Gordan <H.S.

Although only a tenth our size, they have already\nknocked out our Rugby Team in\nthe first round and held our Hockey Team to a draw. The most\ndisappointing feature of these two\ngames was the lack of support\ngiven to our teams. This was\nnot made any easier by CEM supporters turning up in large\nnumbers on each occasion. It is\nto be hoped that the College will\nsupport the Hockey Team in the\nreplay on December 5th and the\nSoccer Team in their Cup en-counters.\nBy now you must all be aware\nthat Imperial is the only University College not affiliated to NUS. There is a strong movement in\nthe Union to get us affiliated, in\nfact the issue will be debated at\nthe next Union meeting on\nJanuary 17th. Colcutt, like\nAsit Chandmal, is neutral.\nThere are, of course, arguments for both sides. The Social\nClubs appear to want us in, while\nthe Athletics Clubs and ' the Establishment ' want us to stay out.\nThe rift between these two factions has become intensified of\nlate : it is to be hoped that everyone will keep their heads and\ncome to the Union meeting to decide our .fate like sensible adults.\nWhere have the cartoonists got\nto ?

The snow flurries\nmade the optimists think of snow and made the pessimists think\nof sleet and stranded coaches, but the old lags just stuffed a couple\nmore sweaters on top of ruc k sacks already bulging with two or\nthree complete changes of clothing.\nBy seven o 'clock on Friday evening a very assorted group of\npeople had gathered outside the Union. They varied from smart\nyoung men who hadn't been able to get back to digs to change,\nto young ladies who made Alpine\nclimbers look slightly obsessed\nthe only common denominator\nbeing bulging ruc k sacks. Our\ncoach left the Union at ten past\nseven, three transport cafes and\nthirteen hours later we arrived in\nthe cold grey morning at Eskdale\nYouth Hostel.\nAt half past ten we set out in\ngroups varying from those intent\non ' doing ' Scafell Pikes to those\nwho just wanted to have a look\nover into Wardale. Throughout\nthe morning there was low cloud\nand squall y rain, the ground was\nexceptionally wet even by Lake\nDistrict standards, stoney paths\nwere streams and everything else\nwas ankle-deep mud. At lunch\ntime the weather deteriorated(l) and there was heavy sleet in the\nvalley. Soon after three o 'clock\nthe first bedraggled group returned to the Hostel; as the\nvarious groups came in, so the\nstring of dismal stories length-e ned. By five o 'clock it was dark\nand two groups were still out, one\nwas a large group that had gone\nup to Hill Tarns and the other a couple who had left the Wardale\ngroup and gone up to the ridge\nabove Wast Water. At ten past\nfive the latter pair appeared surprisingly dry, having got above\nthe sleet into snow and so not\nstarted to get wet until descend-ing. They had met the road near\na pub that put on meals at any\ntime and their description of egg\nand chips and a pot of tea soon\nmade them unpopular with the\nothers who had not had anything\nwarm since breakfast and still\nhad two hours to wait! The\nother party appeared soon afterwards very wet and tired having\ngot lost, finally walking back by\nroad from Langdale.\nOn Sunday we were wakened\nby the wind howling round the\nHostel and during breakfast\nwatched snow being driven down\nthe valley. By eleven o 'clock the\nsnow had stopped and the sky\nslowly cleared until by three\no 'clock the views of the snow\ncovered valley were wonderful.\nAs we gathered back to wait for\nthe coach, those who had ventured on to the exposed ridges\ntold of gale force winds driving\nthe fallen snow into blizzard con-ditions.\nAs we left with the sun sinking\nover the snow covered hills we all\nagreed that we would come again\nnext year and that we must\norganise another trip next term\nwhile there was still a possibility\nof snow to transform the English\nmountains into this wonderland.\nJUDO CLUB\nI.C. UNION DEBATE\n'That this House has no confidence in H.M. Government\nProposed by . . . JOHN MORRIS M.P. Opposed by. . . . . PAUL CHANNON M.P. Concert Hall at 1p.m. on Thursday, 29th November\nIn the Chair Asit Ghandimal\nThe Judo Club after a long period of temporary occupation in\nthe gym now has a permanent mat situated on the top floor of the\nwest side of the RCS building. There is a training session every\nTuesday night at 6 p.m. for graded members, under Dave Barnard,\n3rd Dan, and a beginners' class every Thursday at the same time,\ntaken by John Shepherd, 1st Dan, ex-captain of the club.\nOver the past year the club has been very successful, beating\nteams from Sandhurst, Oxford University, and University of London\nCollege Clubs, but na r row ly losing to Cambridge. Much of the\ncredit for this is due to Dave Barnard, the instructor, who is also\na member of the British Judo Team. For this session matches have\nbeen arranged with Oxford, Cambridge, Southampton, and Leeds\nUniversities, together with a number of fixtures against college sides,\nand two with the Metropolitan Police.\nThis year, the team has lost\ntwo good performers in John\nMilson and Roger Simons, the\nformer showing a marked propensity for throwing opponents\nthrough windows, the latter preferring slow strangulation. No doubt, our enemies will have\nheaved sighs of relief at their ab-sence, even if they heave nothing\nel se. We are still left, however,\nwith many of last year's team,\namong them last year's captain,\nClive Cohen, John Beasely, tre a surer, and of course, Robin Bedding, 2nd Kyu, vice-captain, and\nalso aPG who is interested in\nbreeding flies.\nNewcomers to the club are\nmostly beginners whom we are\nglad to see in such numbers, and\nwe hope that they can overcome\nthe initial difficulties of a difficult sport.\nWe are extremely fortunate at\nthe moment in having a dojo in\nRCS. This will be eventually\nmoved to somewhere in the East\nside of Prince's Gardens. The\ndojo is due to the efforts of Dr.\nCameron, President of the Club\nand 1st Kyu( Brown belt).\nHaving accommodation of our\nown is rather important as it\nmeans that the mat can be down\nall the time and members can\npractice whenever they wish.\nThis has undoubtedly contributed to the high standard of\nJudo and keenness in the club\nover the past year.\nFor graded members there are\nadditional practices and instruction at the Renshuden at 3.15 on\nWednesdavs, and at 6.0 p.m. on\nFriday nights at UL U, IC Judo\nClub members being automatically members of UL Judo Club.\nAll in all, if you do wish to practice Judo, a high standard of\nfacilities is available.\nDepleted IC Team\nthrashes Goldsmiths\nThe first match of the session\nwas fought at the Renshuden\nClub on Wednesday, 31st October against our old enemies,\nGoldsmith College. Usually we\nhave no reason to fear Goldsmiths', but on this occasion we\nwere fielding a somewhat depleted\nside due to the injury of our Captain, Mike Warne, and the non-availability of our tame (almost)\nblue belt, Robin Bedding. Nevertheless, the IC team scored a decisive 5\u20141 victory.\nFirst to fight for IC was newcomer Pete Hunt who rapidly recovered from an illegally applied\nstrangulation hold, and threw his\nopponent clearly for a full point.\nNext came Bob Mee, another new\nteam member, who quickly disposed of his opponent, gaining\na submission in response to a hold on the ground. Malcolm\nMatthews followed this by a clean TAIO TOSHI throw for\nanother full point, John Beasely,\n4th, being forced to submit to a dubious looking neck lock, John\nDowney, starting cautiously,\nfinally threw his opponent with\nIP PON SEOI N AGE. To round off the match, Clive\nCohen felled the last Goldsmiths\nman with HARA I GOSHI, and\nyet another win was chalked up\nfor the IC Judo Club.\nBADMINTON\n-John H. Weddle\nFrom the large crop of fresher s who yearly flirt with the club at\nthe beginning of the season a number of good players have\nemerged as witnessed by their\nentry into the teams.\nYap and Lim, both Malayans,\nhave played for the seconds but\nare first team possibles. The\nformer played for the first team\nagainst Cambridge Cockerels, the\nUniversity's second team, the result being 7\u20142 to I.C.; whilst\nLim helped in the 9\u20140 devastation of Northern Polytechnic.\nChanges do take place in the first\nteam yet the combination of\nDennis Foster and Chris Harvey\nseems invincible, for on looking\nthrough the records this pair has\nnot been defeated whilst playing\ntogether in the last three years.\nWith the influx of new players\nthe Second team is still trying'to\nfind the winning combinations\nhaving lost 6\u20143 to Kings I and\nrather narrowly to 3toy al Vets\n5\u20144. But in these and other\nmatches R. Leary has shown himself to be a player of great potential. The ladies team has entered its\nmatch programme winning as\nusual in its own inimitable way.\nThus they beat L.S.E. with two\nmembers of the team never having played before.\nThe unassailable confidence of\nthe ladies led by Jacqueline\nBrown and Beryl Milner, allied\nwith the members of the Men'sI team bodes well for the Mixed\nTeam and was vindicated by the\nteams' 6\u20143 win over L.^.E.

    "content": "- 6 FELIX\nIC Dramatic\nHAMBURG AND AFTER In July the I.C. Dramatic Society took their production of \" The\nLady's not for Burning,\" by Christopher Fry, to Hamburg. The\nplay was rehearsed at the College for a week after the end of the\nSummer term ; in that week the final plans for the tour were made,\ncostumes were fitted and most of the parts were learnt.\nThe party of 25 left Victoria Station at 3 p.m. one day and\narrived in Hamburg in need of breakfast after the long train journey\nfrom Ostend. The majority of the party lived on a well-organised\ncamping site, complete with a self-service store, which combined the\namenities of an off-licence, a grocery and a post-office ; there\nwas also a restaurant on the site,\ncomplete with multilingual jukebox and a waiter/barman/come-dian.\nThe play was performed in the\nAuditorium-Maximum, a vast,\nmodern lecture theatre with a huge open stage. The size and\nshape of the stage was unknown\nto us before we arrived in Hamburg, so the set had to be rede-signed. The stage crew toured\nthe German Woolworths with an\ninterpreter and afterwards began\nconstructing weird pieces with\ncanvas, wood and string ; the set\nwas complete with the head~of a moose (or probably a shorn deer)\nkindly loaned to us by the\nBritish Consulate in Hamburg.\nThe cast rehearsed in a room\nunderneath the theatre for most\nof every day. An interview was\ngiven for the radio. More tickets\nwere printed. At the end of a week the production was ready\nfor cer form ance. The audiences comprised\nmainly German students and\nBritish, residents in Hamburg:\njudging from the laughter and\napplause, everybody appeared to\nunderstand and appreciate Fry's humour. The day after the first\nperformance there was a critique\nin the local newspaper; sometime that week there was another\nrave, this time in the German top\npaper, \" Die Welt.\" The British\nconsulate expressed eagerness to\nhelp us next time.\nNext time will be made possible by the continual support the\nSociety receives from the College,\nofficially from the R.C. C. and\nprivately from the many members\nof the College who attend and\nparticipate in our productions.\nThe Christmas production will be\n' Ring Round the Moon' by\nAnouilh to be performed on December 4th7 th. Next term two\nplays from I.C. will enter the\nU.L. U. One Act Play Festival in\nan attempt to retain the Clee\nCup. Other plans for next term\ninclude theatre visits, play readings and the Easter production ;\nafter the Summer Term it is\nhoped that there will be another\ntour abroad.\nTL AT i \u00bb \u00ab * % 4 . \u00ab . ^ PEER GYNT at the Old Vic. III C If ie aire\" \u2014 THE PREMISE at the Comedy.\nIf you are rationalist, a positivist, if you devour ' Scutiny' by\nthe yard and find satisfaction in\nHuxley, Russell, Hyer\u2014in short,\nif you are a thinking scientist,\nthen a visit to see Ibsens ' Peer\nGynt' at the Old Vic may strike\nsome unexpected chords.\nThis is only the fifth prof es then a visit to see Ibsen's' Peer\nin London since it was written\nsome ninety-five years ago by the\nman whom many would place\nsecond only to Shakespeare. It\nis a great, shambling masterpiece\nwhich alternates pantomime with\ntragedy, turgid prose and laughing poetry.\nLeo Mikern takes the title role,\nwith a supporting cast of seventy.\nAs with King Lear, one feels this\npart is almost impossible for one\nman, running through such a formidable range of emotion and\nage. Indeed the boggling size of\nthe whole thing rules out a detailed criticism of performance\nand direction, but one or two\nalmost inevitable flaws aside, it is\na magnificent production.\nThe epic poem revolves around\ntwo central themes each with its\nown countersubject. First the\nsupreme importance of the individual personality against which\nIbsen throws his realization that\n\u2022he Eastern pursuit of self-know-ledge is suicide; secondly the\nChristian mystic in Ibsen who declares that the ultimate wrong is\nthe denial of love and yet sees\nthat the growth of personality\nmust involve many such acts.\nTo the modern mind, many of\nIbsen's symbols are over-explicit\nand his ideas dated (he was writing some time before Freud), but\nin this play, everything bounds\nalong with such genial verve and\nintellectual grip that the symbols\nlive, the ideas loosen and grow.\nWith all its faults, this is a great\nTour de Force.\nAs ' Beyond the Fringe ' begins\nto sag a little as the jokes become\nwell worn, ' The Premise,' at the\nComedy, offers a fresh performance every night. In this revue,\nmost of the sketches are done on\nthe spot by the quartet, using\nsuggestions from the audi den ce.

FARREL.\nMITCH GUARDIANS\n. >\n-fingerprints, proceeded to enunciate his theory with true scientific thoroughness. He showed the\ncourt a set of British Standard\nFingerprints, and drew the attention of the audience to their\nsalient points.\nThen he produced a hand print said to belong to one of the ac-c used. On this, he pointed out\nthe salient points from the previous standards and claiming that\nthese pointed to the known tendencies of Billingham, one of the\naccused. Also produced was an\narticle of female attire, sent\nanonymously through the post.\nOn this he claimed was found\nanother hand print similar to that\nof the accused. He pronounced\nalso that the size of the container\nwas similar to that to which the\naccused was known to have an\naddiction.\nNext called was Mr. Graham\nHaclin, a paint expert. He was\ncalled upon to identify the paint\non a red and white striped Mitch\nsitting on the front of the bench.\nAfter much deliberation he pronounced this as as a rare red and\nwhite striped paint known only\nin a small area of South Kensington and producing a can, said\nto have been lifted from that\narea, he discovered his sample\nhad dried up. On a suggestion\nhe should follow suit, he proceeded to finish his damning evidence with great alacrity.\nFinally the prosecution called\na certain Mr. Horace Belcher,\nwho having been sworn in on the\nE to K Telephone Directory, informed the court he was a consultant on safe breaking at present domiciled in Brixton. On\ncross-examination, he claimed he\nwas consulted on the abduction\nof Mitch and on searching the\nbuilding had found something\nknown to us as a paper clip.\nThis, he claimed, he had found,\nin hi' vast experience of ' knocking off' things, was, in the hands\ncont from front page.\nof an expert, a very dangerous\nweapon. (Uproar in court.)\nFor the defence, Mr.' Well' Dunn claimed that Billingham,\nclad in a striped red coat, was a schizophrenic, believing himself\na Guildsman. His companion in\ncrime, Voss, was said to be in\nlove with Michelle, the beautiful\nwife of Mitch, and owing to this\nmixture of perversion and schizophrenia these men had assisted in\nMitch's abduction. A plea for\nclemency was made as the defendants were guilty but insane.\nThe defendants were led out\nand the jury voted. A unanimous verdict of guilty was re-turned. Owing to the previous\nsoiling of the Round Pond an\nunknown member of the jury\nsuggested they should be led to\nthe front of the Royal College of\nMusic to be pilloried and jeered\nby the general public. This sentence was accepted and duly pro-noun ced. The convicted men, struggling\nviolently, were taken by the singing rejoicing jury to the pj ace of\nexecution. There, they were\nchained and roped to the fence\nto receive the derision of a large\ncrowd hurling kitchen refuse,\nwho made up in enthusiasm for\nwhat they lacked accuracy.\nAfter much general amuse-ment, the arrival of a black van\nmanned by blue gentlemen cut\nshort the agony of the convicted.\nThese gentlemen inanely enquired if Billingham and Voss\nhad allowed people to heap such\nignominy upon them thereupon\ngetting the impression they themselves were being threatened\nwith the same. They forced the\nrelease of the convicted and on\nthe dispersal of the mob, melted\ninto oblivion.\nQuote of the day : ' You mean\nto say you just let them do this ?'\n\u2014Chelsea constable.\n\n"

    "content": "PROFILE UNION MEETING\ncontinued\nTHE\nREGISTRAR\nE. Cutliffe MBE, MA\nThat Mr. Eric Cutliffe should remain so much an unknown\nquantity for so many students is no suggestion of an enigmatic per-son ali ty, but simply an indication of the nature of his office.' ' Eminence gris ' unhappily has sinister connotations, but it is no exaggeration to say that there is practically nothing concerning students that\ndoes not at some time or other touch upon Mr. Cutliffe's extensive\ndomain.\nMr. Cutliffe came to Imperial in 1937 as Deputy Registrar. He\nhad spent the ten years after graduating in Chemistry from Lincoln\nCollege, Oxford, with Fry's, the chocolate manufacturers. Even in\nthese days, the College had some vices, he was awarded the MBE1,100 students, and the new man\n' had his nose to the grindstone '\nright from the start. In 1940,\nhaving just assumed the office of\nRegistrar, he left for the Army,\nwhere he spent four years, the last\ntwo of which were at the War\nOffice. In recognition of his ser-LAMLEY'S TECHNICAL & GENERAL\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWING INSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n3 & 5 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7. in 1945.\nOn his return, he found many\nchanges, but these were but a prelude to what was to come.\nAlthough everyone was aware of\nthe tremendous strides that technology had made in the wake of\nsix years' hostilities, few people\ncould at that time have foreseen\nthe prodigious upsurge in technical education that was to take\nDlace a decade later. This has\nbrought to the Registry changes\nas significant as those in the academic departments.\nThe registry is now divided\ninto three main parts, in addition\nto which there are specialised\nsections dealing with matters as\nvaried as vacation training and\nradiation hazards. The Registrar\nis the secretary of the Board of\nStudies, which consists of the\nRector and all the professors, and\nis broadly concerned with the\nteaching arrangements of the\nCollege. Together with the\nAcademic section which deals\nwith such matters as changes in\ncourses, examinations, degree\nregulations, this brings the Registrar and his department into very\nclose contact with the academic\nwork of the entire College. The\nadmissions sections alone handles\nsome 6,500 applications annually,\nand although the Central Ad missions Council on which Mr. Cutliffe is the College's representative, comes into operation this\nyear, this does not diminish the\nRegistry's responsibility. The\nthird section of the Registry is\nconcerned with records and sta-tis tics. What of the man who is responsible for this large and diverse department ? Mr. Cutliffe is a kindly quietly spoken\nperson, who conveys an impression of unobtrusive omniscience\n\u2014-as indeed may be expected\nfrom a man so involved with detailed administration. He is\nabove all an approachable per-son, and with a hint of sadness,\nhe reports that relatively few\nstudents avail themselves of the\nopportunity of talking with him\nabout their personal problems in\nthe hour he sets aside for this on\nThursday lunchtimes.\nHis spare time is occupied\nchief lv by energetic and outdoor\nactivities\u2014he is a keen gardener,\nen jo vs dancing, and his holidays\nare often spent mountain walking\nin Switzerland. When at Lincoln, he was captain of his college boat club. He is appreciative of good books but confesses\nto having no special attachment\nto an v particular field of art.\nThe College owes much to Mr. Cutliffe and to his department.\nThey are somewhat' back room'; their task is painstaking meticulous attention to the needs of\nstudents who are scarcely aware\nof what is involved in making\ntheir studies possible.\nM,J. STACEY. was some rather vague correspondence whereby the College was\nelected ' en bloc' to the I.C. Athletic Ground Club. The\nTreasurer's report followed and\nwas kept to a minimum by the intelligent move of previously displaying the Balance Sheet on the\nUnion notice board. A note of\nlevity was introduced by Mr. Carter's innocent inquiry\u2014' Does\nthe President of the Union feature as an asset ?'\nThe meeting resumed with the\nserious business of the R.C.S. rep. election. The speeches by\nthe proposer s were not of great\neloquence, but seemed to serve\ntheir purpose. Mr. Phillips gave\na sensible discourse on the merits\nof Mr. Massey, but John\nChurchill's plea of ' rug ger club ''\nfinally won the post for Bill Jenkins by 264 votes to 261. Frank\nFichs was unable to dispose oi\nhis political past and managed a count of only fifty.\nThe final section of the meeting\nbrought the Annual Debate on\nthe proposed recipient of the carnival charity proceeds. This may\nseem to many a slightly distasteful\nidea, heatedly discussing the relative merits of two charities, but\nit is necessary, and the underlying note of sincerity atoned for\nthe system used. The comparison between the two charities and\ntheir proposer s was interesting.\nOn the one hand Roger Thomas\nwith a tremendously sincere\nappeal to back the Freedom from\nHunger Campaign\u2014on the other\nand no less sincere, Lawrie\nAustin for proposing the Mental\nHealth national appeal. The\ntremendous influence which Mr. Austin has in this College (and\nquite rightly so), was soon felt\nwhen he began his speech. However worthy a cause Mental\nHealth may be, it is a vague and\nrather nebulous one, and unlikely\nreally to gain support in a college\nas material and factual as this\none. Yet on the first vote Mental\nHealth lost by 259 to 270 and\nnearly every member of the\ncouncil supported it.\nMr. Thomas explained at some\nlength what the Freedom from\nHunger Campaign hopes to\nachieve and how it hopes to\nachieve it. He mentioned long\nterm policies of education, irrigation and development;\u2014-also the\npains and horrors brought on by\nmalnutrition. Mr. Austin stressed\nthe problems in an over developed society and showed that the\neffects were demonstrated in high\nmental illness rates, suicides, and\nnervous ailments. He too advocated long term policies of prevention rather than cure.\nThe debate continued hotly\nand much was said on both sides\n\n"

    "content": "E LIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No.182 Wednesday, 21st November, 1962\n4\nd. QUO RATE UNION MEETING!600 TURN UP\nNO APATHY HERE The first Union meeting this\nyear, held in the concert hall on\nTuesday, November 13th, proved\nboth interesting and informative.\nGathered to vote on a motion\nproposing a reduction of the\nquorum, were some six hundred\npersons, a refreshing sight after\nthe miserable attendances of last\nyear. To what extent the crowd\nhad been lured by the intensive\nand almost sensational advertising\nby John Preece, and in what part\nby genuine interest was soon to\nbe shown. At any rate, the secretary must be congratulated on\nensuring awareness on the part of\nmembers of the College.\nThe meeting opened at 1.15\nwith a reading of the minutes\nwhich were duly signed despite\ngeneral disbelief in their veracity.\nThen the first motion was put\nbefore the house\u2014that the post\nof Deputy President of the Imperial College should be created.\nThe only speech forthcoming\nwas from Mr. Stacey ; he advocated leaving the decision till\nsuch a time when the need became more pressing. The ensuing silence brought cries of\na oath y from the front of the hall.\nHere was yet another example of\nwhat is so often mistaken for\napathy in this College, namely\nignorance. The College did not\ndebate the topic for no other\nreason than that it did not know\nor fully understand the in jpl i cations of such a post. Had two\ninformed and detailed speeches\nbeen prepared, then as was shown\nlater over the charity, there is no\ndoubt that the question would\nhave been debated.\nThe President did not seem\nperturbed when mentioning that\nthe motion had already received\nthe required two-thirds majority\nat a previous meeting; perhaps\nthe lack of information proved a useful method of disposing of an\nobstacle left by his predecessors.\nA measure of this success was the\nvote where not a single person\nsupported the motion, and perhaps half a dozen voted against.\nThe next motion before the\nhouse\u2014that the quorum be reduced to three hundred\u2014was\nrather easier to understand and\nthe debate was quite active. The\narguments against the motion\nwere mainly based on tradition\nand the moral wrong of allowing\nso small a number to decide for\nthe entire Union. The point that\na quorum reduction would encourage the use of pressure\ngroups was well answered by the\nfact that the limit informed was\na minimum and not a maximum ;\nhence any pressure group could\neach be countered. Mr. Maddison rather short-sighted iy mentioned that comfort was of primary importance and therefore\nvirtually ' the less people\u2014the\nbetter'\u2014perhaps armchairs might\nbe installed and the quorum reduced to thirty. On slightly more\nrealistic lines, Bob Finch claimed\nthat ten per cent of the total\nnumber was fair representation\nand that in the summer term the\npresent figure became increasingly difficult to achieve ; thus a reduction was easily justified.\nWhen the vote was taken, the\nPresident shrewdly estimated that\nthe two-thirds majority had been\nreached and the motion was\npassed.\nThe next item on the Agenda\ncontinued on page 4\nMitch Guardians Pilloried\nOn Thursday, 15th November, an event of historic import was\nenacted in the Mining Lecture Theatre. For only the second time\nin history, Mitch had been lost to barbaric marauders from a college\nin the course of demolition, and by public clam our those to blame\nwere brought to account. The Mitch Guardians were tried by the\nRoyal School of Mines Union.\nThe scene was set with all due decorum.(?) From 1.15 onwards,\nthe jurors filed into the courtroom with appropriately serious expressions to take their places on this, the day of judgment and retribution. The judge, prosecution and defence entered to rousing cheers\nfollowed by the accused, Billingham and Voss. These, the male-factors, clad in sackcloth and\nashes, were greeted by boos,\nhisses and a shower of kitchen\nrefuse. Led by two ladies of\nMi nes, both renowned for beauty\nand poise, the prisoners were escorted to the dock, nooses\naround their necks. They stepped\ninto the two plastic rubbish bins\nand their trial began.\nThe judge, His Worship Potato\nOldfield, Lord Chief Justice of\nMines, called upon the prose cu tion, Mr.' Roof' Slater, to present the case against the accused.\nMr. Slater, having delivered a moving introduction on the\ngravity of the mis demean our, proceeded to call his witnesses.\nThe first, Mr. George Manson, a well known Scottish expert on\ncontinued on page 6\nH.

    "content": "FELIX 3 -EVEN RARER BIRDS' I believe that this College ought to join N.U.S. because I don't think Mr. Mooney should have a monopoly over the catering system.'\nThis is a remark made by one of two I.C. students discussing N.U.S.! Now, regardless of one's feeling about the catering system of the\nCollege, this is the sort of crude, illogical, nonsensical rubbish which\nis being paraded about Union circles at the present time and which\nis intended to raise the ard our of the ordinary Union member to\na feverish pitch so that we may well be pushed into an exploit which\nwill probably have a permanently damaging effect on the whole of\nthe life of this College\nMr. Finch, in his article of a month ago, excelled in his rare\nart of rousing fanatical instincts\nbut carefully avoided trying to\nmake a factual case for joining\nN.U.S. He managed to manoeuvre the situation round to the\nbelief that the majority of this\nUnion has always wished to be\npart of the N.U.S. and that it is\nonly the supposedly fudd y dud dies who run the Union that\nprevent it. Now let's get this\nstraight. At the present time we\ndo not belong to N.U.S.(a decision of previous Union members)\nand when the motion to join\nN.U.S. is presented at the next\nUnion meeting, it is essential that\nthe proposer s of the motion\nshould prove, without any doubt,\nthat it is imperative for the future\ne ood of the I.C. Union that we\njoin this National Aquarium of\nlittle fish in too deep water. This\nis something which I feel they\nwill find imo ossi ble to do on a fact to fact basis.\nFirstlv let us consider the aims\nof the I.C. Union, and these of\ncourse are more than those to be\nfound in the Blue Book. A student hopes to emerge from a University having gained a' little\nextra ' to a degree and part of this\n' little extra' can be in the form\nof general ability in meeting and\nhandling people and having developed some powers of accepting\nresponsibility, however small.\nThe Union is a means to this end\nwithout the possibility of serious\nrepercussions following mistakes\nthrough inexperience ; in fact, it\nis a proving ground. Here we\nfind that the Athletic Clubs have\nseized the initiative during the\npast ten years and have built up\na considerable structure\u2014many\nstudent administrative posts, aver v wide range of fixture lists,\nand the appropriate success story\nafforded to the situation where\nthere are ample facilities for\nevery member of the Union to\noar take in his chosen sport. The\nRecreational Clubs are a recently\nformed bod v but in the case of\nthe Social Clubs, they tend to feel\nthat they have had the thin end\nof the wedge. Now many people\nin the S. C.C. feel that their\nstrength is being restricted by not\nmeeting outside students and they\nfeel that by joining N.U.S. they\nwill be helped.\nBut who will it really help?\nThose who heard Jim Daly (a Vice-President of N.U.S.) speak\nrecently were told that the Clubs\nto benefit would be the Dram.\nSoc. by joining the Drama Festival and the Debating Society by\njoining the ' Observer' Mace\ncompetition. However these\nclubs must be very limited in the\namount of time they now have\navailable. The Dram. Soc. have\ntaken the bit between their teeth\nand have now acquired contacts\nto make tours during the summer\nvac. to Ireland or Germany. The\nDebaters, if bored with U.L. competition could well arrange\ndebates with other Universities\nand Colleges outside this sphere.\nJoining N.U.S. will mean that\nabout six or seven people climbing on the band wagon of higher\npolitics \u2014 a thing which they\naren't here for in the first place.\nIn turning to the matter of\nfinance, we approach the argument of all arguments. At1/3 per head it would cost I.C. Union\napproximately \u00a3200 to affiliate\nand on top of this would be re-required to send about six or\nseven delegates to two council\nmeetings a year (they last about\nfour or five days). This would\nbring the total outlay up to \u00a3400\nper annum.\nAt the present time we are\nforced to make certain squeezes\nin our balance sheet in order\nto make ends meet; investments are at a minimum and\nreserves are due to be cut by\n\u00a35,000. As the last quin que ni al estimates for the College were\nslashed by the government during the pay pause, there is not\nmuch hope of the Union obtaining another penny for at least\nthree years for maintenance purposes let alone to finance a twice-yearly outing by six or seven\npeople who like to be bemused\nby social studies. The N.U.S. balance sheet shows that on a total outlay of \u00a340.000, it costs\nthem in the region of \u00a315-\u00a320,000\nin salaries to permanent staff to\nadminister the remainder.\nWe must therefore get something tangible for our money. If\nwe want to join N.U.S., we should\nask ourselves : Does the average\nUnion member gain by it ? Will\nour money be used wisely ? Is it\nthe average Union member's wish that we pour our money into\ncheap holidays for the few who\ncan obtain them for 15/- and a bit of initiative anyway. I doubt\nit very much.\nT. B.P. is what it's worth\nIf you divide the population into two groups \u2014\nthose who take THE TIMES and th os ew\nho don't \u2014\nyou find this: th os ew\nh odon't take THE TIME Sar ein\nthe great majority.

This is an\nexample of but one of the\nfriendly attitudes shown by the\nNorwegians and Dutch alike, for\nGraham Allen, working in Hoi, land, received nothing but hospitality from those he contacted\nwhilst working for Aviolanda on\naero-engine assembly, though he\ntoo felt that he was given too\nlittle work to do.\nHere, in contrast with Norway,\nEnglish was widely spoken and\nthose who did not speak much\nof our language were keen to\nlearn.\nMr. Allen, staying with a Dutch family at Dardrecht,\nvisited other industrial plants such\nas the Esso refinery at Amsterdam and the Delta Works (flood\ncontrol dams), arrangements for\nthese visits being made by the\nForeign Students Service.\nHis emo lo yer s paid normal\nwages whilst these visits were\nbeing undertaken, and were\nquite prepared to allow him three\nor four days per week off work\nfor that purpose.\nBoth Mr. Allen and Mr. Srinivassan were clearly much impressed by the fact that the\nmanagers of their respective\nworks took the trouble to make\nthemselves known, not out of\npoliteness as might have been ex-pec ted, but out of a genuine desire to be helpful and to make\nthe students feel at home during\ntheir stay.\nOn the financial side, Gopal\nreturned to England ' having\nmade a profit on the venture.\nThe pay in Holland was quite\ngood, reported Mr. Allen, but\noverall he did not cover his costs.\nFrom my talks with students\nfrom various departments, both\nmen and women, a clear pattern\nis already emerging and the\nadvice Felix would offer, for what\nit is worth, is, that it is to your\nadvantage to get a job with a company who offers a responsible\njob and secondly, if it can be\narranged, that those intending\nworking overseas will be happier\nout of working hours if they live\nin a Student's Hostel.\nFor the next issue, Felix has\nhopped a Jet 77 to bring you an\naccount of America at work and\nplay.\nRovers,..\nRover Crew Freshers' Hike\nEight stalwart members (in-clu ding an alleged record numbers of five fresher s) of the\nRover Crew departed for Wrotham\u2014by courtesy of London\nTransport\u2014on the exceptionally\ncold morning of November 11th, en route for the annual Freshers'\nHike. From Wrotham the party\nmade its way along muddy footpaths to Ightham, where a map-reading dispute caused a splinter\ngroup to set off through a large\ngarden to Ivy Hatch, only to be\nreunited at the Plough Inn with\nthe remainder of the party who\nhad used the roads and arrived\nfirst. This was considered to be\na good place to stop for lunch\nand about forty minutes later,\nsuitably refreshed and invigorated, a cracking pace was set up\nin the direction of Plantol. After\npassing through this quaint vil-l age, Ightham Mote \u2014 a fine\nexample of a moat house, complete with a resident peacock\u2014\nwas reached. By a further complex system of footpaths, back\ngardens, private property and\nfields full of heifers (which nearly\nnecessitated an exhibition of the\ntechnique of bull-fighting, by\nthose of the party who had been\nat summer camp and had seen\nhow easy it had looked) Knole\nPark was reached. This extensive park, full of the four-legged\nvariety of deer, surrounded a Tudor Mansion, now the seat of\nthe Saekvilles. At about 3.30\np.m., the party arrived in Sevenoaks and decided to abandon the\nidea of returning to Wrotham\nalong the Pilgrims way on account\nof the failing daylight. (The fact\nthat a Greenline coach going to\nLondon appeared at that moment\nhad nothing to do with it, so they\nsay!) By maps and string it is\nestimated that about eleven miles\nhad been covered\u2014giving ample\ntime for the introduction of the\nfresher s to the Crew.\n..and astronomers\nAstronomical Society ?\nPerhaps as\" a subconscious reaction to the formation of the\nPot-Holing Club, a movement is\nafoot to form an Astronomical\nSociety. Several telescopes have\nbeen found in the immediate\nneighbourhood, more have been\ndiscovered further afield and\nsome interest and encouragement\nmet with from senior members of\nstaff. Anyone interested should\nkeep his eyes open for notices in\nthe RCS buildings and in the\nUnion.\nSam-Hem\nWhile few of us wish to know the future, many hope reasonably \u2014to have a hand in shaping it; and this\nrequires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But\ntraditional methods of probing the future are no longer\nIn favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.\nWitches are prophets only of ultimate doom. So today\none turns, in the first instance, to the appointments\nofficer for the pathways to the future.

It means a community of scientific interest within\nUnilever, and continuity of academic contact outside It.\nIt can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction\nto the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.\nIt can provide satisfaction in the pursuit of It and\nfinancial reward In the success of It.

However, it was noticeable this year at the\nGuilds Dinners that the fresher s showed great spirit and what is\nmore, intelligence. In general, the more violent types of sport were\nreserved for the bar, which received the full fury of this later. Satisfaction was expressed with the ample supply of beer during the\ndinners and most of the speeches were thought to be excellent. Is\nthere a possible connection between the two ?\nAt the first dinner, the Mechanicals', at which Prof. Saunders,\nthe Dean of the College, was present, the pattern was set. This\nwas followed by the Civils', and everything got a little noisier. Before\nthe next Guilds' dinner, however, there came an RCS dinner, on\nWednesday, 17th October, and\nthis was visited by a deputation\nfrom Guilds and Mines, with a view to delivering a note of protest to the President of RCS, deploring the de-bagging of certain innocent bystanders (who\nwere simply admiring Theta) the\nprevious Friday. Much to every-one's surprise, the deputation outnumbered RCS in the bar, and\nfor the sake of amity and the\nUnion furniture, the three Presidents decided to make it an IC\nnight. Certain reliable sources\nhave stated that the evening that\nfollowed was one of the best\nseen in IC for five years. The illustration accompanying this\narticle is proof of the Bachanalian enjoyment experienced by\nSpanner a ma\nLord Mayor's Show\nAs usual, the day dawned dark\nand wet, no doubt discouraging\nmany prospective onlookers. However many did turn up to see the\nfun, among them some 80 Guildsmen stationed on a pitch up\nLudgate Hill. The theme of the\nprocession was ' British Exports.'\nIn view of the fact that no one\nhas as yet missed any Guildsmen, we can draw certain in-ference s. Five Guildsmen were\non the National Productivity\nCouncil float inflating balloons\nwith hydrogen gas and releasing\nthem at intervals. There may be\na connection between the NPC and balloons ; we certainly can't see one. We also provided six\nsandwich-board men, strolling\nround looking like characters\nfrom Alice in Wonderland. As a result of his experience, one of\nthese walking hoarding s is seriously considering entering the\nprofession. His time at IC will\nobviously not have been wasted.\nDan ' you can'ta rope round\nme' Rooer wielded an exo ert chopper in the best RCS tradition\n(sur s eons naturally), carving up\nmeat on one of the floats. He\nhas got a finger in several pies,\nso watch out for him (and\nMoonev).\nTo round off the proceedings,\nall 80 Guildsmen accompanied\nBo to Charing Cross at a fast\ntrot. In keeping with the general\nair of festivity, one Macmillan H. gave an excellent imitation of\nSellers P, at the Lord Mayor's Banquet later on in the week.\nEngineers' Dinner and Dance\nAt last, Pete Griffiths has been\npersuaded to divulge the date of\nthis most important event,\nnamely 25th January, 1963. Application forms for this are now\navailable from the Union Office\nor the numerous College Notice\nBoards.\nSwimming Ga'a This occurs on Friday, 30th November, at Marshall Street\nBaths. Come along and give\nyour support, as in 1961. A pair\nof size 423 water wings, with outboard motor if possible, are\nurgently required for one hairy\npersonage.\nMitch\nMitch was duly returned to\nMines on receipt of his air freight\nfrom Bermuda, the monies being\npaid into Carnival funds. Unfortunately, RCM were not\npleased with the resurgence of\nhomo suffrage tt is m on the part of\nM 'tch's erring keepers.\nTailpiece. No mention of J. Wh-te 'cos he always get in, even\nif he did organise the Lord\nMayor's Show business.\nsome prominent members of IC.\nThe goodwill of the evening even\nextended to offering yards of ale\nto some visitors from another\nLondon College. Their reticence in accepting the gift was\nput down to sheer modesty.\nThe Electricals' Dinner on the\nfollowing night was naturally\nrather in the shade of Wednesday's proceedings. It was notable only for the appearance of a Spanish drinking vessel, which\nwas introduced as a Latin Lavatory, and provided some damp\nsport for the imbibe rs. This\n\" pot\"( we don't know whose\narms they are) was kindly\nSpanish Drinking Vessel\ndonated to the Guilds Union by\nFrank Irving and it is hoped that\na tradition of beer showers for\ncourageous fresher s might evolve\nfrom it.\nAt the Aero's Dinner it was\nnoticeable that the bar was\npacked and it appeared that\nDEBATE\nOn Tuesday, 20th November,\nImperial College defeated Chelsea in the Quarter finals of the\nUL U Debating Competition. IC\nproposed the motion that ' Space\nres each is a waste of effort,' and\nthe ensuing debate was a considerable improvement on the\nfirst round. Don Pearson opened\nfor IC, being followed by George\nTurner and Bob Finch, the familiar crushing summary being delivered by Asit Chandmal. Chelsea opened with discourse on the\nmeaning of the word ' space,' a speech probably written for proposing and hastily adopted for\nthe defence. This rather set the\ntone for the Chelsea speeches,\nwhich seemed to lack purpose\nand cohesion. On the other\nhand, the IC team showed good\nco-operation, an improvement on\ntheir first round performance.\nIt is not yet known who our\nSEMIFINAL opponents are, but\nthe support given so far is an insult to the team. At one time\nthere were more Chelsea people\npresent than members of this\nCollege. The standard of\nspeeches can be greatly improved by a large audience and\nif a college like Goldsmiths can\nget 250 people to an evening de-bate, Imperial ought to manage\nmore than the dozen or so people\nthat turned up at the last two\nrounds.\nN. R.E. BARNARD.7 many Guildsmen other than those\nfrom Aero had come along to join\nin the fun. They were not dis-appointed. Finally the Chemical\nEngineering Dinner (last but not\nleast) was memorable on three\ncounts. The first was that there\nwere nineteen members of staff\npresent from the department, a record for Freshers Dinners at\nIC, which shows that there can't be much wrong with staff-student\nrelations in Guilds. The second\nwas that it was the most drunken\nand rowdy (and enjoyable)\nFreshers Dinner for some time.\nAnd the third was Jim Carter's voice !\nRCS Literary\nSociety\nIf you never read any sort of\nbook other than a scientific text,\nthis Society is not for you. But\nif you are interested in, or perhaps merely inquisitive about\nanything literary, then it is certainly worthy of your notice.\nActive, rather than passive participation is our aim. Meetings\nusually begin with a talk given\nby a speaker noted in his field,\nafter which informal discussion\ntakes place over coffee. We want\nto cater for those to whom taking\npart in as important\u2014if not more\nso\u2014than sitting listening. One\ncan do the latter in General\nStudies Lectures, but these sel-dom, because of their brief duration and the relatively large number of people attending, provide\nan outlet for more than a few to\nput forward their ideas for inspection or criticism.\nThe cynic might claim\u2014-with\npossibly some justification\u2014that\nwe are a group of gas bags who\ngather primarily to hear the\nsound of our own voices. Nevertheless, there exists in this college\nno other society which can satisfy\nthis demand in such broad\nfashion. Certain of our meetings\nthis term have been of intellectual literary interest \u2014- John\nHeath-Stubbs enlightening us on\nhis reasons for writing one particular poem, and explaining its\ndeeper meanings. Others, like\nthe South African novelist Sylvester Stein, describing his experiences while editing in that country the magazine ' Drum,' had\nmore popular appeal.\nIn the very near future several\nextremely well-known personal ii ties will be at the Society, so\nkeep an eye on the departmental\nnotice boards for information on\nour activities. Meetings are normally on Wednesday evenings at\n7.30, so that people may eat first,\nand then carry on until talk and\nthe coffee runs out. So if you\nare in the mind for an evening\nwhich is stimulating, and for this\ncollege, new and unusual, try the\nLiterary Society.\n\n"
