    "content": "Rule by Decree\nYou may have seen the annual reports of the sabbatical and other Union\nofficers distributed all round campus yesterday. A few of you may even have\nread them. For those of you that haven't the reports are twelve pages of self-congratulation and mutual admiration. Whilst its clubs, societies and CC Us are as healthy and active as ever the Union itself is irrelevant to most of its\nmembers. Apart from a few UG Ms where groups have turned up en-masse to\nsee certain motions go their way, interest shown in the Union by the majority\nof its members has been minimal. One can hardly blame people for not\nattending Union meetings if they are not allowed to contribute ideas or take\ndecisions. Those that attend are told of what has happened and decisions that\nhave been taken.\nThe Union is run by Gaynor and a select few of her chums. They have\nsurrounded themselves in a brick wall running the Union as their own private\nenterprise for their own amusement. Ideas and initiatives from outside are\nnot permit ed. The President rules by decree, never does she consult or feel out\nopinion outside her small circle of friends but seeks guidance from above\n(Christine) and sets down the law. When will she learn that she was not\nelected a monarch, to rule over the Union, but to represent the views of its\nmembers\u2014not to put forward her own muddle headed notions.\nGaynor Lewis has worked very hard and con cie nti ou sly this year\u2014she\nmay have convinced herself that she had done a good job, but in the final\nanalysis if she looks back through the year she must realise that the Union\ncould have run just as effectively without her.\nPhoney\nAn illustration of Gaynor's lack of consultation has been her decision to\nremove STOIC and IC Radio's facility for making external phone calls.\nApparently College Secretary John Smith had complained about the number\nof long distance calls tn at were being made from the Union Office so Gaynor\npromptly decided to take out the STOIC and IC Radio phones. She did not\nthink to consult either party. Both IC Radio and STOIC need to make\noutgoing calls to provide their service. IC Radio need to be in constant touch\nwith record companies to ensure a good supply of records. However Gaynor\nin her infinite wisdom decided these 'little people' didn't need the phones as\nmuch as the Union Office\u2014which will have four external lines. As President\nGaynor ought to be trying to improve\u2014or at least attempting to\nmaintain\u2014Union facilities. She certainly shouldn't be doing College's job for\nthem and reducing facilities. Increasingly the Union Office is becoming an\nextension of College administration.\nBound Editions\nIf you would like your copies of FELIX bound in beautiful black leather,\ntastefully embossed with your name in gold, all for the meagre sum of \u00a315.50\n(+p&p) then bring in your copies of FELIX any time between now and the\npenultimate week of term.

    "content": "Letters\nApartheid\nAmbassador\nDear Editor\nThe Conservative Society\nwill, we're sure, be only too\neager to invite the S A Ambassador to College under\nthe banner of 'free speech for\nall'. However, we must ask\nourselves, would we have the\nfreedom to speak out against\nApartheid in his country? In the\nUK 'freedom' is supposed to be\na right given to those who do\nnot abuse it\u2014if a government\nactually exists by virtue of a systematically evil law, which is\nall about denying 'freedom' to\nthe majority, then we do not\nbelieve we should be providing\na platform for its representatives. We don't suppose Con\nSoc would invite spokespersons\nfor the Polish, Iranian 01\nLibyan governments (to nam t but a few!) to speak here.\nIf the Con Soc is so\nconcerned about 'free speech'\nperhaps they might also invite\nSteve Kitson (recently released\nfrom a SA jail after serving a horrendous sentence) to speak\nabout the struggle of the black\npeoples in Southern Africa\nagainst the oppression of a crushing ly brutal regime. We\nthink that if Con Soc go ahead\nwith this invitation, it will\nexpose the double standards\nthat they apply\u2014ie some people\n(the wealthy) are more entitled\nto freedom than others.\nYours etc\nB Hillary, Res Asst. Mech Eng\nJ Antonio, PG, Mech Eng\nDear Pallab\nYour report in last week's editorial gave-the impression\nthat Con Soc were in the\nprocess of inviting the South\nAfrican Ambassador to address\nthe society. Nothing could be\nfurther from the truth. At a recent Committee meeting to\nplan next year's events, the idea\nof the invitation was raised,\nparticularly appropriate in the\nlight of the case of Zola Budd,\nthe imminent visit of Mr Botha,\nand the atrocities taking place\nin Africa as Cuban-backed\ninsurgents massacre innocent\ncivilians in the cause of Soviet\nhegemony. While in no way\ncondoning apartheid, I feel that\na College such as Imperial, with\nits strong African connections,\nshould provide a platform to\nsomeone denied it elsewhere.\nYours\nGraham Brown\nCon Soc Chairman-elect\n\u2022Letter^te-f he Ey^or Thumbs Up!\nPallab\nIn the beginning was the\ntoilet graffiti.\nWhy does A Causebrook\ndoubt his own fine talents to\npen his worth and stir the\nmurky waters of IC?\nI would rather have a wank\noutside the American Embassy\nthan blow my horn under the\ndeaf ears of a few sleepy\nstudents.\nA Causebrook you have my\nper s mission to stand on my\nshoulders.\nThumbs up the squad.\nSteve Marshall\nPS: Who gets to put coffee in\nMichael Newman's acid?\nSenseless\nBehaviour\nDear Pallab\nHaving just witnessed the\nRCS initiations ceremony I feel\nthat the time has come to curtail\nsuch stupid and pointless\npractices. There may well be\nhistorical reasons for these\nbarbaric habits, but each year\nthey seem to get progressively\nworse. Rotting fish guts, eight\nweek old milk and decaying\noctopus cannot any longer be\nregarded as funny things to\npour over people. Surely no one\nwould want the initiates to\nbecome seriously ill and it\nseems to me that they may well\ndo. If they do not catch some\nparasitic disease from the\nrotting debris then following up\nwith a Round Pound dip must\nbe seen as an attempt to assume\nthat they end up being the worse\nfor wear.\nI myself following one such\nstupid event managed to catch a urinary infection, cystitis and a kidney infection, and I would\nnot recommend this to any-body. I hope that someone will\nhave the sense to stop this\nsenseless behaviour.\nNewman Ban\nDear Pallab\nAs the members of the\ncommittee, formed to hear\nMichael Newman's appeal\nagainst the disciplinary action\ntaken by the Executive of\nImperial College Student\nUnion, may we acquire some\nspace in your journal to explain\nour decision and clear up any\nmisconceived ideas that may\nhave arisen over this matter.\nMr Newman admitted to\ndefacing two pages of the\nR SMU Newsletter due for\npublication before the Mines\nReview. He also agreed that he\nwas uncooperative in locating\nthese 'alterations' when asked\nto do so. The Executive meeting\nof 21 March decided, unanimously, to ban Mr Newman from the Union\nBuilding for two months from\n5:30pm,23 March. He was\ninformed of this and h is right of\nappeal by letter. We understand\nhe was also banned by you from\nthe FELIX Office and charged\na sum of approximately \u00a316 for\nreprinting costs of the defaced\narticles. Mr Newman did not\nappeal against the Executive\ndecision until 9 May, although\naccording to Union Disciplinary Procedure, he should have\ndone so within fourteen days of\nnotification. We felt however\nthat as much of this time fell in\nthe Easter vacation he should\nbe allowed to continue his\nappeal.\nAfter hearing statements\nfrom Gaynor Lewis, Chris\nGriffin ( R SMU Newsletter\neditor), yourself and Mr Newman, this committee were\nunanimous in that the\nExecutive were correct in their\ndecision and that disciplinary\nprocedure had been correctly\nfollowed.\nMr Newman was not\nprevented from voting at either\nthe U GM or SCC meetings and\ncould have made statements at\neither, by proxy, if he so wished.\nThis committee did make a further statement to the fact\nthat in future disciplinary cases\nboth complainant and plaintiff\nbe invited to produce writte'n statements before the Executive\nmeeting and informed in\nwriting of the date and time of\nthe said meeting.\nI hope this explanation of our\ndecision will put Mr Martin's mind at rest and that Mr Newman was given a fair\nhearing by an independent\nbody, chosen at random, from\nImperial College Student\nUnion Council.\nHe may also wish to be\ninformed that at the appeals\ncommittee Mr Newman refused\nto give an assurance that should\nsuch an opportunity arise\nagain, he would not commit a similar act.\nYours sincerely\nCH Hendy, D Parry, DH Southey, J Claydon, P Burt\nNB: Lee Evans also sat on the\nappeals committee but was\nunable to be contacted in time\nabout this letter.\nEstates\nFiasco\nPage 2 I Joanna Claydon\nWmmW Friday, May 25, 19841\nDear Sir\nEstates have done it again. In\nspending College money on\nwonderful technological key-card doors for Southside halls\nof residence they have\noverlooked the fact that it won't help...the problem in Southside\nis that anyone prepared to wait\nfive minutes will be let in by a resident. Whether they're let in\nthrough one set of doors or two\ndoesn't seem that important.\nI 've been let in at 3:30am by a security guard who doesn't know me before know, without\na word\u2014let alone a request for\nID. As long as people in\nSouthside continue to let\nstrangers in without asking\nthem for Unioncards (for\nexample), security in Southside\nwill continue to be non-existent.\nI don't know how to improve\nthis, but spending \u00a3??? on a new\nset of doors won't help.\nAlongside this, the fact that\nthe doors are so cheap they\ndon't close properly, and can\nthus be shoved open when they\nare 'latched' shut, doesn't seem\nto matter much...\nND Anderson\nElec Eng 1\n\u2022 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nStarlight Express playing at the\nApoljo Victoria\nAndrew Lloyd-Webber, Richard Stilgoe\nand Arlene Philips have produced the most\nspectacular musical blockbuster to hit the\nLondon theatre for years. The musical is\nabout the secret life of railway locomotives\nand coaches, which are portrayed by actors\non rollers skates. There are three main\nlocomotives, Greaseball the de is el engine\nwith his gang of menacing rock'n 'roll\nhoodlums; Rusty, an old fashioned steam\nengine; and, the star of the show Electra the\nfuturistic ' A CDC electric train, played by\nJeffrey Daniels of Shalamar. All three are\nanxious to win the annual race.\nThe plot sounds crass (and it is), however\npeople don't go to musicals for intellectual\n- enlightenment. People go for the dynamic\nmusical numbers and fast moving action.\nSomething which this musical has in\nabundance. This high speed spectacular on\nskates is an amazing feat of special effects\nand choreography. The theatre itself has\nundergone extensive alterations to\naccommodate the roller skate track which is\nbuilt around the audience. The actors whizz\naround the track at breakneck speeds\nDuring the race crash barriers are raised\nhydraulically into place and a gigantic metal\nbridge is moved to connect the tracks. Also\nTV screens appear and show the action that\nis out of sight.\nThe classification into diesel, steam and\nelectric allows a variety of musical styles; the\ndiesel trains sing Grease-type rock'n 'roll; the\nsteam trains sing blues and the\nhermaphrodite Electra turns every scene\ninto futuristic disco frenzy with strobe light\nelectric sparks and green laser beams.\nStilgoe rises to the occasion with words\nwhich are exactly right on every\noccasion\u2014funny, pun ny( where human\ndrama is translated into locomotive drama)\nand ably demonstrating what talented and\ndemonstrating what a talented and versatile\nword smith Stilgoe is. Best memories are\nBelle's solo about her existence as a dilapidated sleeping car, the lovely blues\nscene involving Poppa steam-engine and\nRusty's coaches and the hilarious parody of\non D.I.V.O.R.C.E. which is sung by Dinah\n(the dining car) in true country and western\nstyle when she splits up with Greaseball. The\nlocomotive equivalent is U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D. I found'the opening sequence rather tame,\nwhich was sad as it was intended to be\npunchy and dramatic. The action built up\nslowly and became quite exciting in the\nsecond half. Sometimes the plot slipped from\nunlikely to downright corny, particularly in\nthe 'Starlight Express' scene where the great\nlocomotive spirit in the sky comes down to\ncheer up the downcast Rusty.\nDefinitely worth seeing over the summer,\nhowever seats are practically fully booked\nuntil A uS^ Diane Loue 1\nPage\nThe rival locomotives (left to right) Greaseball the diesel, Rusty\nthe steam train and Electra the electric train of the future.\npORCi HE* TBI The London Contempora^^ance\"\"^ TT^concludes the short visit to Sadler's Wells f Theatre on Saturday. During this time it has performed six works, two of which receive their\n.premiere in London.\nContemporary dance differs from classical ballet in a number of ways. Unlike classical ballet '\nwith its rather outdated tales of witches, princes,swans and the like, modem dance retains the '\noption to deal with topics of a more abstract nature. The works are generally shorter, so that a typical evening may contain two or three pieces, balanced to contrast with each other. The '\nstage is smaller, the sets are less elaborate, in short the tedious 'pomp and circumstance' of\nclassical ballet is stripped away, to leave the dancer as free as possible to express himself in\nmovement alone.\nThis is certainly the policy of the London Contemporary Dance Theatre. The emphasis on\nthe dance is so great, that the dancers often treat it is as a subject. One piece in particular'New\nGalileo' by Siobhan Davies is entirely devoted to 'the potential of physical movement', and\nironically, I found this piece most tedious, as Ms Davies does not allow the dancers the\nenormous versa tii ty of expression of which they are capable.\nThe lighting and stage ett ect s for the programme were by necessity very simple, and by way\nof this, extremely e ii ect ive. It is very simple, when designing sets to lose sight of the simplicity\nunderlining shapes rather than movements so that much of the dance is based around fixed or\ngyrating poses. Some of these are staggeringly beautiful, but others, alas just stagger and the\ncostumes for the contemporary stage make your actors appears 'trendy' and stylish, like\nsome Habitat department. Here, however both lighting and costumes were excellently' |\nbalanced, each one depending on the other for its effect. In 'Songs, Lamentations and Praises'\nby Robert Cohan for example the effect of golden lighting on the dancers give them the illusion\nof nakedness.\nThe second programme finishes this Saturday evening. It consists of three works, 'Agora'\nby Robert Cohan with the Chaconne in D minor and Brandenburg Concerto no. 6by Bach;\n'Run Like Thunder' by Tom Jobe, with a computer-written score by BarringtonPhelaungand '\n'Carnival', an amusing interpretation of Saint Saens, 'Carnival des Animaux' again Siohban\nDavies. The three pieces taken together promise to provide a versatile evening for anyone,\n' and I very much hope that this show will go on tour in the near future. , _\nJohn Burgess\n1984 II FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022mm\n{*ture\nJohn Wayne did it; Clint Eastwood does it; it's not just for the\npony-club girls! Would you like to take up riding?\nMention riding and you will\nimmediately conjure up visions of\nfourteen-year old girls with pony\ntails and rich parents. But it's not\nlike that at IC Riding Club. First\nof all, riding isn't very expensive\nbecause of the discounts the club\narrange, and secondly, riding\ncaters for all levels of\ninvolvement, from relaxing, get-away-from-it-all hobby to fierce\ncompetition, for all levels of\nexperience, for men and women.\nHow do you get started?\nRiding is something that\nanyone can take up at any any\nage from three to sixty-three.\nLessons are essential at the\nbeginning. No matter how good\nyou become there is always room\nfor improvement, even experienced riders have lessons\noccasionally. Riding is a bit like\nlearning to drive\u2014the aim is to be\nable to completely control any\nhorse. Horses, in turn, are\nschooled to understand and\nobey any rider. The beginner has\nto learn to get on and off, stop\nand go, and then change gear\n(walk, trot, canter, gallop).\nAlthough reversing round corners and hill starts are\npossible (but silly!), three point\nturns are unnecessary! You don't have to be Evel Knievel to\nstart jumping, and the ultimate\nexpression of control is dressage\n(ballet for horses).\nRiding Club use a school in\nPet t's Wood which they\nrecommend for beginners,\nsimply because a good technical\nintroduction to riding is offered.\nAs a member, lessons are \u00a32.40\nan hour. Don't be put off by the\nidea that you will need expensive\nriding gear\u2014you won't. It's only\nreally important what goes on\nyour head and feet. If you don't have a riding hat, your school will\nlend you one to begin with\u2014they\ncost \u00a316 new and can often be\nobtained secondhand. You must\nwear 'sensible' shoes with a low\nheel. Something with no heel\ncould allow your ankle to slip\nthrough the stirrup in an\naccident, and then you could be\ndragged along the ground at a gallop. American-style cowboy\nboots ar fine. Moulded rubber\nriding boots are \u00a39, and a good\nbuy for the beginner. Wear what\nyou like elsewhere, as long as it is\ncomfortable. Tight jeans will not\nonly pinch, but may split! Your\nschool may ask you to get your\nown riding whip\u2014even if you\nnever intend to use it\u2014because it\nhelps you to hold your hands\ncorrectly.\nThe prospect of falling off is\nquite discouraging, but it\nhappens rarely (unless you take\nup jumping, when it happens a lot). It is only likely if something\ndisturbs the horse. Beginners\nusually get the quietest horses,\nso don't worry but always wear a hat and correct footwear just in\ncase.\nTammy on Tolkien in Hyde Park\nFELIX\\\nWhen you can ride a bit, walk,\ntrot and canter, you can go on\none of the club's 'Fun Rides', and\nthis is where I came in. Despite\nthe fact that I have only been on a horse twice since age eight, and\nboth these occasions were long\nago, I agreed to go with the club\nto Wimbledon for a hack on\nWimbledon Common. In case\nyou've forgotten Hack in this\ncontext means a recreational\njourney on horseback and has\nnothing to do with ICU committee meetings! Instead,\nyou spend an hour admiring the\nscenery and humming Mike\nOldfield's Horse Song. Horses\nare surprising for two reasons:\nthey are very much taller than\nyou expect, and they are not very\nclever. They are content to\nfollow the horse in front, unless\nthey get the idea that there might\nbe a race, and then they are liable\nto take off at a gallop. But they\nare smart enough to realise when\na rider is not in control, and then\nthey take advantage by suddenly\nthrowing their heads down.\nAlthough my horse was the\nsweetest, most gentle and\nobedient in the stable, the aptly\nnamed Velvet, I had great\ndifficulty keeping it under\ncontrol. Apart from wishing I knew what the horse was\nthinking, I enjoyed the hack\nimmensely\u2014the two worst\nmoments were getting on ('Me?\nUp there? You must be joking!')\nand getting off again ('Can I have\na ladder?'). I was especially\nworried that the horse would bolt\nduring the (rather long) time I took to get off. And afterwards?\nFirst, the hunger, then the feeling\nthat my knees were coming\napart, which gradually subsided\ninto aching leg muscles. It took a week to get over it.!\nCompetitions\nThere are two teams which\ncompete in inter college University of London events, a novice dressage competition and\na3ft jumping course. IC ' A' team\ncame third this year and two\nFriday, May 25,\nRosemary\non Trigger\nriders were placed in the\nUniversity of London top ten.\nTeam trials are held in the first\ntwo weeks of next term and there\nwill be special lessons for team\nmembers.\nHolidays\nThe club recently had a very\nsuccessful holiday weekend in\nCornwall. The price was \u00a340 for\ntravel, food and board and about\neight hours' riding. This holiday\nwill be repeated next year, and\nthere will also be a weekend\nintroductory course on cross\ncountry at a point to point racing\nstables in Lincolnshire. To get\nthe most ou it of these holidays,\nyou really need to be fit and\nexperienced.\nSocial\nThe club organise a day trip to\nthe University Championship in\nOctober and another to Olympia\nat Christmas. Tuesday lunch\ntime meetings in the Southside\nUpper Lounge allow members to\nplan informal outings to stables\nfor lessons and hacks.

    "content": "News Feature\nThe alternative\n(and shorter) annual repo\nYou may have seen a copy of the detailed annual reports\nof Union officers presented at yesterday's AGM, with\nparticularly long contributions from the sabbatical\nofficers. These reports are essentially an inside and\nrather personal view of the Union's year, so it seems\nappropriate for FELIX, which is charged with providing\nan independent voice within the Union, to take a step\nback and analyse the year from an objective point of\nview.\nNotable Successes\nThe year has been marked by a few notable successes, mainly in\nthe field of services. The most\nimportant of these is the\nacquisition of the Union refectory but also worthy of note\nare reduced bar prices, the new\ntravel office, and the opening of a separate regalia/sports shop. The\ncredit for these successes goes\nmainly to Christine Teller.\nChristine is certainly the most\ncompetent and experienced\nsabbatical officer ICU has had\nfor at least five years. Her\ndeparture from College will be a great loss to the Union, in which\nshe has played a major role for\nover three years. Unfortunately\nthe only person to have more\nconfidence in her abilities than\nthe author is Christine herself.\nShe has tended to become\nunapproachable and unwilling to\nlisten to the views of those.\noutside an inner circle of hacks,\noften taking the view that she\nknows best what is good for\nstudents without bothering to ask\nfirst. Despite these shortcomings\nshe will undoubtedly be a hard\nact to follow.\nDisappointment\nAmong all Union members,\nhacks and others, it is hard to find\nanyone who isn'td is app on ted with the performance of Gaynor\nLewis as Union President. She\nhas, it is true, carried out her\nduties with some degree of\ncompetence, but that is the end of\nher achievement. There has been\nno leadership, no initiative and\nno imagination to raise her role\nabove that of a mere\nadministrator. Worse still, she\n(like Christine) has often seemed\nto have scant regard for the views\nof Union members, prefer ing to\nmake decisions by 'Presidential\n, decree' than by the proper Union\npolicy making procedure.\nIn her annual report she\ncomplains of alleged inaccuracies\nin FELIX over the year which she\nhas 'had to continually correct'.\nIt is unclear to whom she has\ncorrected them. It certainly\nwasn't FELIX, and it wasn't the\nUnion membership either. She\nmay have had to 'correct' the\nimpression that some College\ndisappointing: President Gaynor Lewis\nPage 4 UmWUhWkWUmWMmWUmWUUM I Friday,\ncompetent: Dep Pres Christine\nadministrators had got from\nFELIX that most IC students are\ndiss at is if ed with many College\ndecisions and the manner in\nwhich their views are ignored by\nthe Union.\nFurther Consolidation\nThe year has unfortunately seen a further consolidation of the trend\nstarted in 1980/1 towards\nallowing the Union to become a branch of the extended College\nadministration. The recent\nepisode of telephone facilities for\nIC Radio and STOIC has\ndemonstrated this perfectly.\nInstead of defending student\ninterests and preventing the\ncutting by College of an essential\nfacility for the student media,\nICU (or more precisely its\nPresident) has, on the slightest\nprompting from College, enforced its removal without\neven token consultation with\nthose directly involved.\nThe reason for this is becoming\nclear to a number of frustrated\nUnion officers outside the 'inner\ncircle' who find it impossible to\nplay their proper role in Union\n. decision making. Whilst Gaynor\nLewis and Christine Teller are\nsupposedly representing IC\nstudents at College committees in\nfact they only represent\nthemselves and their close\nassociates. When was the last\ntime the President referred a matter of policy to the sovereign\nbody of the Union, a general\nmeeting? No wonder few people\nattend UG Ms when all they can\nexpect from Gaynor is a list of\nMay 25. 1984 HOT MM K SH Teller\nthings she has already done and\ndecisions she has already taken.\nShe has reduced the role of aUG M to that of a last Court of\nAppeal where her decisions can\nbe challenged by those who\noppose them. If they have been\nlucky enough to discover in time\nwhat decisions have been made,\nthat is.\nUGM Trivia\nWithout any doubt the most\nimportant decisions in this Union\nare being taken by the President\nafter minimal consultation with\nher self-appointed advisers. Less\nimportant decisions are taken by\nthe Executive, and Council,\nlargely through its own ineptitude, is able to decide only\non matters of little real\nsignificance. At the bottom of\nthis process, UG Ms are left with\nlittle to concern them but the\ntrivia that has been a feature of\nthis and previous sessions.\nThe feeling that this situation is\nthe very reverse of what it should\nbe is growing amongst many of\nthose involved in the Union as\nwell as the majority of Union\nmembers who are more disaffected with their Union than\never. Looking at next year's leadership gives little optimism\nfor a fundamental change of\nattitude. The Union 'system' has\nlargely seen to that. What is\nperhaps needed is a significant\nchange in the power balance\nwithin ICU; there is at least some\noptimism that this long-overdue\nreform will become a reality next\nFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF 1 ER1AL COLLEGE UNION\nPhew!\nWhat a Scorcher!\nPictured above at Saturday's Rag\nFete, a student suffering the after\neffects of a Mines curry. All in all\n\u00a3850 was raised from stalls and\ntrips up the Queens Tower. Guilds\nPresident Mike Stuart raised\u00a3300\nby allowing his successor Maribel\nAnderson to shave off his hair.\nFor a full account of the Fete see\nUGM Sketch on page 3.\nNo 675 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAngry Exchanges\nin Phones Fury!\nUnion President Gaynor Lewis has decided that IC Radio and\nSTOIC will have their outside telephone lines removed with the\nintroduction of the new telephone system in September. The two\nstations presently have external extensions which enable them to\nmake outgoing calls through the College switchboard.\nWhen told of the particular assertion were true the only\nnecessity of IC Radio's being able\nto make outgoing calls, Miss\nLewis said they could make their\ncalls from the Union Office. It\nseems unnecessary, however, that\nIC Radio staff should be required\nto do this when it would cost\nnothing extra to allow them to\nmake outside calls from their\noffices in Southside, as at present.\nIC Radio need to make outside\ncalls to keep in touch with record\ncompanies from which they\nreceive over \u00a32,000 worth of\nrecords every year. STOIC often\nrequire to telephone people to\nrequest interviews and over the\nyears have been successful in\ngetting many famous names into\ntheir studios. The Ents office is\nalso to lose its external call\nfacility which was only installed\nlate last year and which they use\nto organise band bookings.\nThe reason for Miss Lewis'\nproposed restrictions is unclear.\nThere is no apparent need to limit\nthe total number of extensions\nable to make outgoing calls since\nall extensions are physically\nidentical and the type of calls\nwhich can be made from any\nparticular one is controlled by\ncomputers in the exchange. Miss\nLewis told FELIX she felt the\nUnion would do well to get one\nextra line, but the College are\nconcerned only with the total\nnumber of instruments, not the\nnumber which make outgoing\ncalls which is irrelevant for\ninstallation purposes. Even if her\nreason why there are no lines left\nfor IC Radio, STOIC and Ents is\nthe increase in lines in the Union\nOffice.\nThere have been complaints\nfrom College that a number of\nunauthorised overseas calls have\nbeen made by the Union. It seems\nthat IC Radio and STOIC are\nhaving their ability to make calls\nsacrificed to appease College\nwhen these unauthorised calls\noriginate from the Union Office.\nIn any case the new system will be\nable to provide the Union with\ninformation about calls made\nfrom each individual extension so\nany abuse will be easily discover d. The new system will be a modern electronic exchange with\nmany new facilities. All telephones will make and receive\ninternal calls and many will also\nreceive incoming external calls.\nOnly those phones authorised by\ndepartments (which includes IC\nUnion) will make outgoing calls.\nAGM Awards\nAwards for notable contributions to the Union were presented to staff\nand students at yesterday's Annual General Meeting. Two Union\nGeneral Awards were made to students who have done outstanding\nwork for the Union and Honorary Life Membership of IC Union was\nawarded to six members of staff.\nU GAs were awarded to Ian Bull ACC Chairman and President-elect\nfor his work for athletics amongst other things, and Peter Rodgers for\nwork on FELIX and the Union Handbook. These awards are made by\nthe President alone, unlike other Union awards. Gaynor Lewis was\nalso awarded aUG A by Council.\nHonorary Life Membership was awarded to Jo Hewanicka, who\nrecently left her job as Union receptionist; Roy Hicks, Bookshop\nManager; Bill Mason, Boathouse Manager; Nick James of the\nComputer Centre for his work for Sporting Motorcycle Club; Robin\nSmith, College Tutor and S CC Senior Treasurer; and Dr Sinclair\nGoodlad for his work for the Pimlico Connection society. It was\ndiscovered that Dr Goodlad had already been awarded HL M in 1968\nbut the Union had lost records of this.\nThe meeting considered the President's annual report next, and\nthere was a move to refer it back by John Martins on the grounds that\nhe disagreed with her views of UG Ms. He spoke to this referral and as a vote was being taken he challenged the quorum of the meeting. Since\nthere were less than 100 people present the meeting was deemed closed\nby the Chairman.\nI FELIX, May 25 19841 I Fnal\n\n"

IBM will\nalso supply some control\nsoftware and the wages of two\nprogrammers for three years.\nThe aim of the project from\nIBM's point of view is that\nseveral chemical engineering\ndepartments including Imperial's will develop experience in\nteaching on IBM equipment. It is\nexpected that the department will\nbe used as a showpiece by the\ncompany. However the\ndepartment has signed no formal\nagreement to provide software to\nIBM and the company described\nthe deal as part of their effort to\nbe good corporate citizens.\nThe equipment will be\ndelivered in the summer and used\nprimarily by undergraduates.\nMore Sherry Money!\nr The Union will get a3.8% increase in its sub vent ion from College for\nnext session, it was agreed recently.

Could it have been\nthat, since these three countries\nare all democratic countries, they\nbelieved all attempts at\ninterference in internal South\nAfrican democracy to be highly\ndeplorable? It would seem\nprobable then, that the reason for\ntheir action (or inaction) was that\ndemocracy, even South African\ndemocracy, ought to be\npreserved.\nDemi-God\ndemocracy\nWas it not for such reason that\nthe UK invaded the Falkland\nIslands, and the USA, Grenada,\nand the French, Chad? With all\nthis Evidence of subservience to\nthe demi-God democracy, it is a bit confusing to find no evidence\nof these powers having sent a task\nforce to South Africa.

If you choose to crush us\nand impose your will on us, then\nyou not only betray your trust,\nbut you will live in security only\nso long as your power is greater\nthan ours. No South African will\nlive in peace in South West\nAfrica, for each will know that\nhis security is based on force, and\nthat without force he will face\nejection by the people of South\nWest Africa.\n\"My co-accused and I have\nsuffered, we are not looking\nforward to our imprisonment.\nWe do not however feel that our\nefforts and sacrifice have been\nwasted. We believe that human\nIn view of the proposed visit to Britain of the South\nAfrican Prime Minister Mr PW Botha, at the\ninvitation of the British Government, EM Ugoala\nexpresses a few thoughts regarding South Africa,\nNamibia (originally South West Africa) and the\ninternational community (with particular reference to\nthose few countries who dominate it).\nsuffering has its effect on those\nwho impose it. We hope that\nwhat has happened will persuade\nthe whites of South Africa that\nwe and the world may be right\nand they may be wrong.

Notably, the UK government was not among\nthese. In 1968 tie UK government gave the British Rio\nTinto Zinco Company its\nblessing to develop the Rossing\nuranium mine, and agreed a contract for the UK A EA to be\nsupplied with uranium from the\nmine. Despite the labour\nopposition promise, in 1973, to\nend this contract if re-elected,\nnothing happened, but most\nastonishingly, the UK took the\nun pre c en dented step of disagreeing with the International Court of Justice when, in\n1971, it proclaimed the\noccupation of Namibia by South\nAfrica to be wholly illegal.\ndeep\ncommitment\nJa Toivo was jailed for 20 years\nin South Africa's infamous\nprison on Robben Island with no\nremission. The extract from his\nspeech at his 'conviction' shows\nhis deep commitment to human\nvalues and his humanity. His\ncrime was membership of\nSWAPO, which was not then,\nand is not now an organisation\nproscribed by the South African\nadministration.\nIt took international cooperation (yes, even between\ncommunists and capitalists,\nhomosexuals and heterosexuals,\nand men and women of all races\nand creeds) for humanity to have\nreached the situation of having\nsubstantially eradicated the\ncancer of smallpox, yellow fever,\napartheid\ncancer\nbubonic plague and malaria.\nOver a period of less than 30\nyears.\nWhat then of the cancer that is\napartheid?
