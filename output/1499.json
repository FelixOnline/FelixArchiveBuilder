    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nFELIX\n10\nCompetition Corner\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 october 2011\nBought a shiny new smartphone but forgot to budget for any credit? Never fear, as Vizz Africa have\npromised to give some lucky people pre-paid SIM\ncards, so you can make good use of your new gad-get. While the new network may have a focus on\nvery reasonable rates to call Africa (1p per minute\nto a landline in South Africa!), the costs for calling\nwithin the UK are pretty good too, costing only 4p\nper minute for a landline call, or 9p per minute\nto another mobile. So that credit is going to last\nyou a while.\nBut enough figures, here\u2019s how you can win:\nOver the last two decades, we have more or\nless come to accept the presence of robots in\nour lives. They make our cars and process our\nfoods - our manufacturing industry would not\nbe anywhere near the same without them.\nThe robots of today, however, are a far cry\nfrom the imagined robots of science fiction\n\u2014 the problem is how to integrate an artificial\nintellience into a robust humanoid shape that\ncan process and interact with the world around\nthem. Scientists from Munich and Tokyo have\nbeen working together to solve this problem,\nand recently released a video of their test pro-totype, PR2, fetching them a sandwich.\nWhat is remarkable about this is that PR2\ndid not know very much about sandwiches\nwhen he went on his quest \u2014 he started off by\nlooking in the kitchen fridge, and not finding\nanything matching the description there, he decided that Subway would be the best place to\nfind one. Ordering the sandwich, picking it up\nand heading back home, he proves more than\na little versatile at navigating the treacherous\nSnacks now, world domination later\nFeroz Salam\nA Tech Show comes to town\nLast weekend, the first annual London International Technology Show came to ExCeL\nLondon. With some big names in the line-up\nand bargain-price tickets, we decided to take\na look at what the latest technology exhibitors\nhad to offer.\nThe spread of companies represented was\nquite wide, ranging from online systems\nbuilders and sellers such as Scan Computers\nand Overclockers UK to software companies\nincluding Parallels, and even some magazines came along, for example Micro Mart\nwelcoming visitors into a shed built for the\noccasion\u2026 All-in-all, it was set to be an interesting day.\nFirst impressions however, were not quite\nwhat was expected. To one side was a Rock\nBand 3 playing area, and the other side hosted a driving simulator running on three 3D\nmonitors which you had to sit in a hydraulic\nchair to see. In front there were a few machines playing the Battlefield 3 campaign. As\nit turns out, this was not just bad planning,\nand was quite representative of the exhibition\nas a whole. Gaming featured fairly heavily,\nas did 3D displays, and it was rare to come\nacross demonstration computers set up with\nonly a single monitor.\nSlightly further in though, things started to\nalign more with our expectations, with the\nAsus stand showing off some powerful machines in interesting builds. The centrepiece\nhere was an Intel hex-core i7 based setup\nin a custom transparent case, with two side\ncompartments for water-cooling. This was\ndefinitely the most interesting cooling setup\nI have ever seen, with each compartment having its own waterfall of cooled water cascading into a pool at the bottom. If cooling is\nyour thing though, the liquid-nitrogen overclocking session later in the day would have\nbeen right up your street.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, if high-end PCs don\u2019t float your boat, there were old\narcade games available to play for free in authentic cases, and even demonstrations of a\ntiny remote control helicopter that seemed to\nbe indestructible. At least, it suffered no damage from its several impacts with the ground\nfrom near the high ceilings of the room.\nOther things to see and try included full\n3D home cinema setups from Samsung, high\nquality headphones and a Top Gear simula-tor, in which you would be taken in a lap\nround the Top Gear Test Track with The Stig\ndriving.\nOverall, as an \u201cInternational Technology\nShow\u201d, I have to say it was quite disappoint-ing, and did not meet with expectations. On\nthe other hand, as an event at which to play\nsome new games \u2013 including some on PCs\nyou probably cannot afford \u2013 and see smatterings of new-ish technologies, it was not a bad\nday out. There could have been more exhibi-tors, and it could have been more focused on\nnew technologies, but it was their first year,\nand I reckon it will definitely be worth a look\nwhen it returns next October. And hey, with\nfree pens and a free copy of a magazine that\nwould normally cost more than the ticket,\nwhere can you go wrong?\nChris Bowers\nof calls, texts and internet\naccess for your phone\nFor your chance to win a SIM card with \u00a3100 worth\nof credit, simply email competition@vizzafrica.\nco.uk with the answer to the following question:\nWhat was the title of Dappy\u2019s recent Number One\nhit?\nA.

    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX\n20\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 October 2011\nL\nast week saw Julian Barnes claim\nthe Man Booker for his short\nnovel \u2018The Sense of an Ending\u2019\nin what has been derided as the\nworst shortlist in the prize\u2019s 43\nyear history. No doubt this was caused in part\nby the judges\u2019 reward for readability; a strange\nrequirement for the pre-eminent award for literary fiction in the UK.\n\u2018Sense\u2019 treads familiar territory \u2013 middle-aged, middle-class pondering on memory and\ndeath \u2013 such is the scope of modern British\nliterature. Tony Webster is a retired divorc\u00e9\ncontemplating the passivity of his life when a\nletter from the past resurfaces, causing him to\nre-evaluate his actions, or rather his memories\nof them. What comes next is a psychologically\nacute but oddly unbelievable retrospective of\nhis rememberings; of what he has forgotten,\nand what he has chosen to forget.\nBarnes\u2019 story touches thematically on Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s \u2018The Remains of the Day\u2019\nand \u2018On Chesil Beach\u2019 by Ian McEwan (both\nBooker winning writers \u2013 though McEwan\nPoem for the Week\nGood Morning Autumn\nby Osas Omoigiade\nTrees crane over like almost naked men-Whose shame is barely covered by the red and\ngold flannels\nAlthough these too fall\nAnd these men will soon stand stripped\nThe fruits of the trees are confused\nWhile some die, conkers ripen\nThe Sun is not sure how high to rise\nLittle humans shiver in their t-shirts; given into the\nlies of a bright heatless sun\nGood Morning Autumn\nIn his thirty-ninth \u201cDiscworld\u201d novel, \u2018Snuff\u2019,\nTerry Pratchett takes his beleaguered officer of\nthe law Sam Vimes on a well-deserved holiday\n(the relaxation bit does not last long, of course)\nto the countryside. Pratchett has built, over the\ncourse of the novels, an entire self-contained universe set on the disc of a world on the back of\nfour elephants standing on the back of the a giant\nturtle, with a cast numbering in the hundreds.\nAs the series has progressed, it has grown funnier and smarter. The writing has developed into\nsharp prose; the books have matured from being\nbroader satires of the fantasy genre into wonderful pieces in their own right. It is their consistent\nhumour that has ensured Pratchett\u2019s success.\nEvery page is imbued with comedy, but Pratchett revels as much in plot and description as in\none-liners and satire. For a fantasy crime novel,\n\u2018Snuff\u2019 contains enough asides on slavery, class,\nthe countryside and literature to stagger the newcomer expecting some light fluff. The marvellous\nthing about this book is that these little moments\nnever feel forced and are deftly woven into the\nnarrative.\nBy \u2018Discworld\u2019, Sam Vimes has gone from\nbeing the drunken shambles of a man seen in\n\u2018Guards! Guards!\u2019 to a renowned figure of jus-tice; head of the city watch and Duke of Ankh.\nAlong with his fantastic savage-yet-suave butler\nWillikins, Vimes must decipher a countryside full\nof chickens, goblins, villagers, and rich lords; all\nwhilst attempting to bring justice to those who deserve it, avoiding the disapproval of his wife, and\nstill finding the time to show his son the wonders\nof the countryside.\n\u2018Snuff\u2019 contains all the usual Pratchett magic\nbut in many ways the humour seems more natural and frequent than in earlier works, relying\nmore on observation and action rather than on\njokes. This evolution in style allows the plot to\nmove forward at full speed, and certainly there is\nenough going on to keep the reader turning pages.\nBy removing protagonist Vimes to the country-side, Pratchett has taken him out of his element.\nThis is certainly not a new formula, but it is pulled\noff with such \u00e9lan it is impossible to begrudge.\nReaders new to Pratchett can find the book enjoyable and accessible, but certainly the many references to his past work make it a treat for his long\nterm fans. Within a week of its release \u2018Snuff\u2019had\nsold more copies than the entire combined sales\nof every book on the Man Booker Prize long list.\nWhilst some literary snobs may doubt the contribution of his genre, Pratchett\u2019s legions of fans and\nphenomenal sales record leave no doubt that he is\nstill on an upward trajectory.\nSnuff is out now\n\u201c \u2018Sense of an Ending\u2019\ntreads familiar territory...\nsuch is the scope of\nmodern British literature\u201d\nDavid Carr on the shortcomings of this year\u2019s Man Booker prize winner\nNot exactly a Booker novel\nLet\u2019s do the Vime warp again\nIan Green\nwon for a different book). However, \u2018Sense\u2019\nlacks the pathos of Ishiguro\u2019s unreliable narrator and the subtlety of McEwan\u2019s interweaved\nnarrative.\nAndrew Motion, the former Poet Laureate\nand last year\u2019s Booker head judge, said that\namongst the dire shortlist, Barnes\u2019 novel was\nthe clear winner, though his panel did select\nHoward Jacobson\u2019s similarly middle-of-the-road \u2018The Finkler Question\u2019. It makes you\nwonder if perhaps the list was compiled only\nto give Barnes his just desserts; after all, this\nwas his fourth nomination for the prize and his\nfirst win.\n\u2018The Sense of an Ending\u2019 is not a bad book.\nIt is faultlessly written, and at times beautifully so, but in its constant exposition it often\nfeels more like an extended essay than a full-blooded work of fiction. Surely to win a prize\nthis big a novel must have a good chance of\nmaking it into the English Canon, and this one\njust does not fit the bill.\nWhat do you mean you asked for Jeff Bridges?\nFelix Arts is constantly looking for new poets.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 11\nFRIDAY 28 October 2011\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhis Tuesday, the UN is expected to name a child,\nsomewhere in the world, as\nthe planet\u2019s seven billionth\nliving resident. The news\nhas been greeted with alacrity by much\nof the same planet\u2019s media, most notably\nThe Guardian, which ran articles such as\n\u201cWhy current population growth is costing the Earth\u201d. The idea that population\ngrowth is spelling doom for us all is as\npopular as it is old. It is just as wrong.\nThe obsession with population\nfound its most popular spokesperson\nin the form of Rev. Thomas Robert\nMalthus who, in the late 18th Century,\nargued that if the poor of the world\nkept reproducing at a high rate (the\npoorest tend to have the highest birth\nrates) then the only possible result in a\nworld of limited resources will be mass\nstarvation. It was in part due to such\nideas that the Irish famine was allowed\nto run its terrible course. There is some\nevidence to suggest that nature provides\nmass population reduction as a way of\nbenefiting those left behind: incomes\nrose significantly in Britain following the\ndevastation of the Black Death, which\nleft one person in three dead.\nWorld population has skyrocketed\nsince the days of the Plague and Famine,\nleading academics to postulate that the\nnext Big Disaster could well eclipse\nall those that went before it. The 20th\nCentury anti\npopulation\nmovement\nreached\nits zenith in\n1968 with the\npublication of\nPaul Ehrlich\u2019s \u2018The\nPopulation Bomb\u2019. The\nbook brought home to non-academic readers the potential\nhorrors of overpopulation with\nthe prediction that hundreds of\nmillions of people in developing\ncountries would perish to hunger\nin the coming decades. Its front cover\nproclaimed, \u201cWhile you are reading\nthese words four people will have died\nfrom hunger\u201d.\nThose decades have passed and\n2.8 billion extra people now walk this\nEarth, an increase greater than that\nanticipated by Ehrlich. The result? In\nthe last 50 years, world population may\nhave doubled but agricultural production\ntripled. Daily food supply per person\nhas increased by around 25%. But the\nnews is even more positive: population\ngrowth is beginning to tail off. As people\nget richer, despite being more able to\nafford more children, they\nin general choose to\nhave fewer. Better job\nopportunities cause\npeople to focus more\non their careers\nand lower rates\nof child mortality\nmean fewer\nchildren need be\nborn in the first\nplace. The average\nworld birth rate\ndeclined from 5.3 births\nper woman in 1960 to\n3.0 in 2006. It is true that these\nare just averages and some regions\nhave gotten significantly worse.\nBut, these are countries such as\nNorth Korea, Somalia and Zimbabwe\nwhere it is clearly due to political\ncircumstances, not population. The\ndata paints a clear picture \u2013 increasing\nglobal population is not leaving people\nworse off and is anyway reaching\nequilibrium, not exploding.\nBut while Ehrlich\u2019s theory seems\ndisproved,\nmany modern\nenvironmentalists\npoint to Malthusianism\nin a new form \u2013\nglobal warming.\nThe increased\nemission of CO2\nthat growing population\ncreates is endangering the very\npeople who, by being born, create it.\nThis was certainly the message of The\nGuardian\u2019s articles: more people =\nmore warming.\nNonsense.\nMore consumption = more warming,\nregardless of the number of people.\nI fail to see how a moral person can\nworry about the existence of a child in\na large family in rural Africa who burns\na little wood for cooking while we\nenjoy CO2\nintensive Western lifestyles\n7 Billion? That\u2019s Numberwang!\nRory Fenton argues that population growth isn\u2019t a priority\nJakov Marelic\nover here.\nLifestyles\nin the\ndeveloping\nworld are\nincreasing\nCO2\noutput\nin spite of\ndeclining fertility.\nPopulation just\nis not the major issue\nunless we have a\npopulation boom in\nthe West.\nThis\nis a\nstatistic\nevery\npopulation worried\nperson should\nbe made aware of: doubling\nthe incomes of the world\u2019s poorest\n650 million people would take the\nsame resources as less than 1% of\nthe incomes of the world\u2019s richest\n650 million. Resources mean carbon.\nConcerned about global warming?\nGreat, hand out condoms to bankers,\nnot Bangladeshis. It\u2019s time to put the\npopulation myth to rest.\nMany people have argued that democracy is actually one of the most radical\nideas in political history. To treat people\nas equals with equal votes sits well with\nmost people today. We can also see the\neffects of ideas like these in the West\nin the last 300 years or so with mass\neducation, rising standards of living,\nand the abolition of slavery, infanticide,\nchild labour, serfdom and feudalism.\nThere has also been greatly reduced\ninfant mortality, religious persecution,\nracism, misogyny, superstition and war.\nThe few wars that do occur tend to be\ntremendously more violent, but it is\nalso a long-term trend that they are getting rarer.\nOf course, the human race is not out\nof the woods yet. Over-population, climate change, epidemics and nuclear\nwar are serious threats to civilisation\nwhich may \u2018do us in\u2019 yet. Starvation\nand disease still kill millions every year.\nNow, all this is surely uncontroversial and few people today would argue\ndemocracy is a bad thing. But it is interesting to see which groups oppose it\nand what their motives are.\nLibertarians, anarcho-capitalists and\nothers from the extreme political right\nare some of the most powerful and\nwell-funded opponents.\nThis is unsurprising. These groups often argue that poor people are to blame\nfor their own poverty. So the values of\ndemocracy which say all people, rich or\npoor, are equal are abhorrent to them.\nThe socialist Tony Benn summarises\nit as, \u201cBefore we had the vote, all the\npower was in the hands of rich people,\nif you had money you could get health-care, education and look after yourself\nwhen you were old. What democracy\ndid was to give the poor the vote and\nit moved power from the marketplace\nto the polling station, from the wallet to\nthe ballot.\u201d\nThe danger democracy poses has\nbeen expressed by the right-wing economist Milton Friedman when talking\nabout the relations between political\nfreedom of voting and economic freedom of the market. He writes: \u201cwhile\neconomic freedom facilitates political\nfreedom, political freedom, once estab-lished, has a tendency to destroy economic freedom.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, people tend to vote\nfor things that will benefit them i.e. not\nunfettered markets.\nIt is interesting to see many of the institutions that conservatives favour are\nusually dictatorial not democratic: the\narmy, the navy, the church, the business\nfirm and the patriarchal family.\nReligious groups have also been\nknown to oppose democracy. In their\nworldview, just as there are laws of\nnature like gravity which are true\nthroughout the entire universe, there are\nuniversal moral laws. These absolute\nmoral laws have been passed to us by\nthe supernatural creator of the universe.\nDemocracy is thus absurd because we\ndo not need to make laws by finding a\nconsensus of the people, we just need to\nread holy scripture.\nAbdur-Raheem Green, a fundamentalist Islamic preacher, is worth quoting at length on this. \u201cOne of the major\nproblems [with democracy] was that\nthe leader would always have to pamper to the desires and whims of the people in order to gain their support, thus\na leader would not be able to take the\nmorally sound decisions that a leader\nshould\u201d. It is not hard to imagine what\nkind of morally-sound decisions AbdurRaheem is thinking of.\nA (thankfully anonymous) Catholic\nauthor wrote on a recent Felixonline\ncomment about their church\u2019s position\non various moral issues: \u201cThese things\naren\u2019t like government policy, open for\ndebate and consultation to be brought\ninto line with popular public opinnion.\n[sic] These are tennets that have been\nhanded down and safeguarded for over\ntwo millenia [sic] and frankly that isn\u2019t\ngoing to change any time soon.\u201d\nAlthough having said this, many religious people support democracy and\nin fact Christian socialists in the UK\nwere part of the popular front winning\nthese rights in the first place. We must\nnot forget that followers of religion are\npeople too; they also want a happy,\nhealthy, prosperous life and to be masters of their own destiny just like everyone else.\nIs Democracy the best policy?\n\u201c...the human race is\nnot out of the woods\nyet\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "\u201d\nFELIX Friday 28 october 2011 17\nCOMMENT\nI\nn last week\u2019s edition of Felix,\nthe comment piece \u2018The Hell of\nHeaven\u2019 asked this question to\nthose who hope for an afterlife:\n\u201cWould you enjoy heaven?\u201d In\nthis article, I\u2019m aiming to clear up two\ncommon misconceptions about what\nChristians believe by offering a picture\nof what the Bible actually says about\nour eternal future. By the end of it, I\nhope that you\u2019ll have a good impression\nof whether or not I think I\u2019ll enjoy heav-en, and why. NB: I\u2019m not addressing the\nquestion of whether there is life after\ndeath, because that wasn\u2019t the question\nasked by last week\u2019s article. However,\nthat could be the subject of some fruitful\ndebate in the future.\nMany people brought up in the UK\nwill be at least vaguely familiar with\nthe Christian perspective on the after-life. When asked what heaven is like,\nmany people talk of a soul leaving the\nbody and floating away like a balloon\nto an ethereal, static and mind-numb-ingly boring existence. By contrast,\nthe Bible\u2019s picture of eternity is much\nmore real and concrete than the Platonic\nview we\u2019re often presented with. The\nBible asserts that God will bring about\nwhat Christians call the New Creation:\na physical place that is similar to the old\nuniverse, but better. Similarly, we won\u2019t\nRichard Oberdieck\nJohn Raftery\nAbandon the old grade system\nThere are more things in heaven...\nspend all eternity as body-less entities;\nin the New Creation we\u2019re given new\nbodies that are similar to the old ones,\nbut better:\nThe trumpet will sound, and the dead\nwill be raised imperishable, and we\nshall be changed. For this perishable\nbody must put on the imperishable, and\nthis mortal body must put on immor-tality. When the perishable puts on the\nimperishable, and the mortal puts on\nimmortality, then shall come to pass the\nsaying that is written: \u201cDeath is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is\nyour victory? O death, where is your\nsting?\u201d\n(1 Corinthians 15:52-55, The Bible)\nSecondly, we won\u2019t spend our time\nendlessly prostrating and grovelling.\nIn this life we go about our work, build\nfriendships, have adventures and ex-periments. These good things continue\nin the New Creation, except that all the\ndrudgery and frustration of work will be\nbanished. The phrase \u201call good things\ncome to an end\u201d is turned on its head:\nno good thing comes to an end. Think of\nthe very best that this world has to offer;\nthat which makes life worth living. I\u2019m\ntalking about deep intimacy, beauty that\nstops you in your tracks, and pints with\nL\nast week, it was announced that UCL is going\nto change their grade system towards the American\nmodel. They are abandoning the first, 2:1 etc. leading Imperial\nstudents to ask: is this also going to\nhappen to us? The Union immediately\nsaid: We won\u2019t allow that to happen\nbecause then this will become a (more)\ncompetitive university. Wow, what an\nargument. I mean, seriously, we aren\u2019t\nin Kindergarten here, we are at a university with a widely known and appreciated reputation. We are at the forefront of research and all the companies\nin the world are standing in line to get\na hold of our graduates. You think this\nisn\u2019t competitive? Ask yourself: why\nam I studying here? It is not (entirely)\nbecause you love engineering, science,\nor medicine. It is because you want to\nbe the best and therefore you study at\na university which can give you a degree that states that you are the best.\nOne that shows that you went through\n4 years (or in medicine even more) of\nhell, of sweat and tears, of the problem\nsheets and course works, only to get a\ndegree on which it says \u201cImperial College London\u201d. That is why you study\nhere.\nDon\u2019t tell me that employers will be\nconfused and won\u2019t appreciate your\ndegree. Because a) you still come\nfrom Imperial College and that doesn\u2019t\nchange a bit, and b) in the new system,\nemployers can more easily determine\nyour worth. Let me put it like this, how\ndo employers differentiate between\na \u201cgood\u201d and a \u201cbad\u201d first? A first is\nthe highest degree you can get here. It\nstates that you are one of the best in\nyour subject. But if over 60% of graduates get a grade that high (or almost\nthat high), how can you tell who really is the best? These are things that\nemployers want to know. I think that\nif you ask Shell, McKinsey, or BCG\nwhat they think of the idea of making\nthe university more competitive, whilst\nintroducing a grade systems that allows\nthem to differentiate between students,\nthey would be all for it. Don\u2019t insult the\nintelligence of these companies by saying they wouldn\u2019t understand another\ngrade system (which, by the way, is\nalready used in the US, a country not\nunimportant in the job market).\nBe honest, you don\u2019t want the grade\nsystem changed because you think\nit will mean that your grades will go\ndown. You think that you are too mediocre to stand out from the crowd in the\nnew system. If you admit that there is\na discrepancy between the grades that\nyou get and your actual \u201cquality\u201d, then\nyes, you can complain about this being\nfixed, but you can\u2019t seriously blame\nthe university for fixing it. The only\nperson that is to blame is you, because\nyou don\u2019t study hard enough to merit a\n\u201creal\u201d first.\nSo please, let\u2019s face reality: there\nis no real point in arguing for the old\nsystem, because we are already a very\ncompetitive university and companies\nwill appreciate this move. It introduces\nbetter differentiation and more hones-ty, and if we are objective and rational,\nthat\u2019s what all of us want. The new system won\u2019t be perfect, but the fact that it\nwill improve matters should be a good\nenough reason for introducing it.\na good mate. If there is a God, all these\nthings were his idea!

    "content": "BUSINESS\nThe Imperial Entrepeneurs report on the service failure that failed BlackBerry users, and\nits impact on both companies and the markets\nDuring the evening of Monday October\n10 you were possibly one of the frustrated Imperial students that couldn\u2019t\nget their BBM working. That was the\nday on which all BlackBerry devices\nlost their email and BlackBerry Messenger services. Some devices lost internet access as well, leaving many bewildered students unable to update their\nFacebook statuses or tweet any random\nthoughts. The situation stretched on,\nand became much more irritating when\non early Tuesday morning these student\nBlackBerry users had no means to entertain themselves during lectures. Later that day there was an announcement\nby RIM stating that the issue had been\nresolved. This probably brought hope\nto those who had been yearning to have\ntheir fully functional smartphones back,\nhowever, right after that announcement\nthe delays and outages spread world-wide. These outages would end one day\nlater with all services being restored,\nbut leaving many displeased users all\nacross the world.\nWhile the outage may have been annoying for students, it has had a large\nand relevant impact in many busi-nesses, considering the large number\nof companies that rely on these phones\nto enable communication and email\nmanagement amongst their employees.\nAs much as this outage has negatively\naffected many people, right now there\nis probably no one as worried than Jim\nBalsillie and Mike Lazaridis, co-CEOs\nof RIM.\nThese two probably lost a lot of sleep\nBlackBerry\u2019s Outage and its Aftermath\nduring the past few weeks, worried with\nthoughts that their company is going\ncontinuously downhill, making it easier\nfor their primary competitors (i.e. Apple\nand Android smartphones) to take over\ntheir niche. The year 2011 has certainly not been a good one for RIM, but\nBlackBerry\u2019s decline had started much\nearlier. At one time, BlackBerry devices were the clear industry leaders, but\never since Apple launched the iPhone\nin 2007 the company has struggled to\nretain its market share, something that\nbecame even more evident with the release of the iPhone 4 last year. Everyone\nat RIM headquarters was probably hoping for 2011 to be the year they bounced\nback, with some new ideas in mind that\ncould help turn the situation around.\nHowever they now find themselves in\nan even worse situation, caused by a\ncombination of bad decisions and even\nworse luck.\nTheir first and biggest hope, the\nlaunch of their new tablet device, turned\nout to be a great failure. The PlayBook\nlacked the software and the functionality that most people expected, and was\ncertainly not enough to compete against\nthe iPad. RIM has already admitted\nthat prices for the tablet will have to be\nslashed as an attempt to save the situa-tion, since right now the device is barely\nselling at all.\nThis was the first piece of bad news\nthat RIM got in 2011. The company was\nsurrounded by bad publicity after the\nLondon riots that took place during the\nsummer, in which the BBM service was\nused by the rioters as one of the main\nmeans to communicate. On top of this,\na sharp reduction in profit and sales was\nannounced about a month ago, which\nhad a significant impact on the value\nBy\nM\u00e1ximo Sanz Hern\u00e1ndez\nThere have already been direct revenue consequences due to compensa-tions. RIM charges wireless carriers\na monthly fee based on the number of\nBlackBerry users. Many analysts agree\nthat some of those fees will have to be\ngiven back, and losses in the value of\nRIM shares are predicted. These short-term problems should not be the main\nconcern around the company headquarters however; the outage has irritated many users, who are particularly\ndispleased with how RIM has handled\nthe situation. There was a continuous\nlack of information throughout the out-age, and when RIM finally released an\nannouncement saying that the problem had been fixed the situation only\nbecame worse. This has undermined\nBlackBerry\u2019s reliability and the company\u2019s credibility, and will make users\nare more and more tempted to switch to\ncompeting devices.\nOne of the main niche markets that\nBlackBerry could lose is large companies using BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES), a feature that allows easy\nmanagement of large fleets of smart-phones. Some companies are no longer satisfied with BlackBerry and are\nstarting to consider the advantages that\nother companies provide. An example\nof this is DLA Piper, a law firm that is\naccelerating discussions about switching to iPhones and Android devices. As\nfor the rest of the users, BlackBerry no\nlonger presents the unique features that\nonce made them so popular. The new\niOS now includes iMessage, a service\nthat allows all Apple devices to commu-nicate. In other words, a clear and direct\ncompetitor for BBM.\nThere is only one hope left for RIM.\nThey now rely on the shift to a new\noperating system (QNX), first used in\ntheir PlayBook. Right now, a successful transition is the only thing that can\nhelp them close the gap on Android and\nApple OS. Let us hope that the company starts experiencing better luck in the\nfuture, otherwise we could be witnessing the fall of what once was an empire.\nRemember!

He takes me\nup to the third floor of the union, where\nthe snooker rooms reside, to conduct the\ninterview and take some pictures.\nThe rooms are impressive, boasting four full-sized tables - which are a\nlot bigger in real life than on BBC2. I\npoint this out, and Elwin smiles. \u201cMost\npeople tend to be surprised about how\nmuch the television shrinks the tables\n- it\u2019s all camera angles\u201d. The whole\nplace seems to be a pretty well-guarded\nsecret, but Elwin wants more people to\ncome along. \u201cWe organize beginners\u2019\ncoaching sessions on Tuesday nights, so\npeople can come along and discover the\nsport, even if they\u2019ve never held a cue\nbefore\u201d. He offers to let me shoot some\nballs, but I decline - I would definitely\nneed some coaching first!\nWe begin the interview proper, and I\nstart by asking about the snooker club\u2019s\nrecent achievements. \u201cWe\u2019re currently\ndefending BUCS Trophy champions,\nhaving won the second-tier competition\nof the BUCS Snooker Championships\nfor the past two years\u201d.\nThe snooker season revolves around\none tournament held as part of the\nBUCS nationals events in March: the\ntwenty-odd university teams participating are divided into four groups. The\ntop two of each group qualify for the\nChampionship knockout tournament,\nwhile the third and fourth-placed teams\ncompete for the Trophy.\nElwin is clear about the club\u2019s objective for this season: \u201cAt the moment our first team is ranked 9th in\nthe country. Our aim this year is to\nbreak into the top eight and compete\nwith the \u2018big\u2019 teams: Cardiff, York,\nManchester, Southampton, Warwick,\nQUB, Nottingham and Kent. We have\ntwo or three guys capable of making\nbig breaks, so I think we have a pretty\ngood shot this year.\u201d He sounds con-vincing, and I\u2019m inclined to believe\nthat they\u2019ll manage this year after\ncoming so close in previous editions.\nThis prompts the question, though:\nwhat does preparation for the BUCS\ntournament involve?\n\u201cWe just had team trials last week,\nwhich we use to gauge the standard of\nthe new people at the club. However,\nseeing as we only have the BUCS\ntournament in the second term, whoever is playing best at the time will be\nin the team. We also have an internal\nleague in which members compete for\nthe prestige of being the best player in\nthe club.\u201d\nOn top of that, ICU Snooker now\nhas a professional coach coming in for\nthe first time in their history. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nbrought in Patsy Fagan. He was the\nUK champion in 1977 and is an ex-world number 11 \u2013 he comes down to\nour club on Thursday nights to help us\nimprove our skills,\u201d says Elwin enthu-siastically. What, then, does it take to\nbe a good snooker player? The snooker president smiles knowingly at this:\n\u201cit takes a few weeks to pick up the\nbasics, how to hold a cue, how pot a\nball...but to go from that to being able\nto make big breaks, it just takes hours\nand hours of practice.\u201d\nI gather that Elwin has been putting the hours in at the table, then. I\nask him how he got into snooker, and\nit turns out that he really came into\nhis ball-pocketing stride at Imperial:\n\u201cFrom a young age I\u2019ve always been\ninterested in snooker, but before Imperial it only went as far as having a\nsmall table from Argos in my garage\nand practicing on my own or with my\nbrother. I only started taking it seriously when I got here \u2013 I was a complete amateur when I arrived. In two\nyears I\u2019ve gone from struggling to pot\nabout 2 balls in a row to potting 20\nballs in succession, which I managed\nfor the first time a couple of weeks\nago.\u201d Although all sports take prac-tice, the facilities at Imperial seem\npretty top-notch, and it\u2019s pretty easy\nto come and play a few frames during\nlunchtime - with or without a bow tie.\nThe snooker club also sends an\n8-ball pool team to the BUCS championships - something of a revival,\napparently. I ask what the main differences are; surely a team of snooker\nplayers have the required skills to\ncompete in pool?\n\u201cAh, sure, the skill set is very similar but in terms of tactics there are\nsome important differences. In pool\nyou need to be slightly more careful\nabout where your cue ball ends up after a shot. You have to be careful in\nsnooker too but with pool, being reckless will often lead to your opponent\npotting 6 or 7 balls in a row to win a\nframe.\u201d Duly noted. He also tells me\nthat the club organizes free trips to Rileys Victoria, a local pool hall, every\nweek.\nAny parting thoughts? Half-jokingly, half-seriously he breaks into a\nsmile: \u201cSometimes it feels like I\u2019m\nsacrificing my degree to play snooker.\u201d Is it worth it? \u201cDefinitely.\u201d\nICU Snooker can be contacted at\nsnooker@ic.ac.uk.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 9\nFriday 28 october 2011\n\u2018The Life Scientific\u2019 is a new radio series currently being broadcast on BBC\nRadio 4. Each week Jim Al-Khalili,\nphysicist and science communicator,\ninterviews a different leading scientist,\nasking about their work, their life, and\nwhat motivates and inspires them.\nThe first scientist in the hot-seat was\nPaul Nurse, a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist and current President of the\nRoyal Society. Nurse has had a rather\nextraordinary life for a scientist, from\nhis initial failure to gain a place at uni-versity, to his revelation only a few\nyears ago that his sister was in fact his\nmother, and Al-Khalili adeptly makes\nuse of these events in the interview.\nHowever, it\u2019s the detail with which\nNurse describes his own research, including a rather poignant story of him\ncompletely botching his third year degree project because of the thermostat in\nthe water bath, where I think the show\ncomes into its own. For Nurse, and AlKhalili too in fact, for once don\u2019t seem\nfrightened at the prospect of the show\nbecoming, too scientific, too technical,\ntoo niche, and instead talk in real terms\nabout things that are actually interest-ing. To some of us, anyway.\nNext up was Steven Pinker, a science\nwriter and Professor of Psychology at\nHarvard University. Here, Al-Khalili\ntakes the listener similarly deeply into\nhis interviewee\u2019s area of research, and\nthis time the show benefits from it even\nmore. Together they discuss matters as\nimportant and controversial as human\ncapacity for violence, and the meaning\nof life without a \u2018soul\u2019, and Pinker is\ncharacteristically unafraid to say what\nhe thinks. Yet despite even being played\naudio footage of a rival openly criticising him, as well as Al-Khalili\u2019s own\ngently probing questions, Pinker remains unprovoked, and this lack of tension makes for a much better interview.\nPinker also comes across as genuinely passionate about the fundamental\nconcepts of science. He\u2019s keen to emphasize the importance of a good ex-periment, and of removing the bias that\nsociety inevitably stamps on any results,\nand he\u2019s obviously inherently a scientific thinker. Often he discusses aspects of\nhis work, or science in general, unprovoked by Al-Khalili, and it\u2019s refreshing\nto hear someone talk so eloquently and\nwarmly about ideas that few people outside the scientific community recognise\nas important.\nThere are more great names on the\nway for the series, including astronomer\nJocelyn Bell-Burnell, who discovered\npulsars yet famously didn\u2019t win the Nobel Prize, and Michael Marmot, a doctor\nwho conducted some ground-breaking\nresearch on the relationship between\nlife expectancy and social status. So\nwhy not have a listen? BBC Radio 4,\n9am on Tuesdays, and you can iPlayer\nthe previous ones too. Great stuff to knit\nto, if you\u2019re so inclined...\nArianna Sorba\nCould the language you speak affect\nhow you think? The idea has long been\nshunned by academics as a relic of an\nimperialist, racist past when non- Europeans were deemed damned to low level\nthought by their \u201cunsophisticated\u201d lan-guages. But not all who have held this\nview have been racist \u2014 haven\u2019t we all\nat times thought something along these\nlines? Perhaps the strict order of German has something to do the country\u2019s\nmany famous philosophers and scien-tists? And surely the lack of a future\ntense, as in some languages, must affect\ntheir view of the time?\nIn his 2011 book \u2018Through the Language Glass\u2019, linguist Guy Deutscher\naddresses these issues head on. And\nwhile he dismisses dinner table generalisations about German (really quite an\nerratic language) and future tenses (\u201cI\nam going to leave next week\u201d makes\nperfect sense and yet has no future\ntense), he points to convincing evidence that yes, the language you speak\ndoes change how you view the world,\nalthough perhaps more subtly than we\nmight think. The influence has been\nshown in three areas- our perception of\ncolour, space and gender.\nRussian eyes and British eyes can see\njust as well as each other \u2014 so how on\nearth could they perceive colour differ-ently? The question of colour and language was started by the 19th Century\nBritish Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed something peculiar\nabout ancient Greek poems \u2014 they always called the sea \u201cblack\u201d. That this\nhappened without fail made it much\nmore than poetic imagery \u2014 there simply wasn\u2019t a word in ancient Greek for\nthe colour blue. It was later discovered\nthat many tribal language still don\u2019t\nhave words for certain colours, the reason being that, as with the Greeks, without artificial dyes there simply wasn\u2019t\nany need for these words.\nWhile it may seem strange to us that\nsomeone might see blue as just another shade of green, say, the English\nword \u201cblue\u201d seems equally strange to\na Russian, who uses separate words to\ndescribe light, sky blue and dark navy\nblue. But surely we still see the same\ncolours? Incredibly, no.\nIt turns out that when your language\nprovides a separate word for a colour, it\nseems further away from other colours\nthan if the two were linguistically on the\nsame spectrum. So Russians don\u2019t just\nsee the different shades of blue, they really do seem like fundamentally different colours, unlike to a native English\nspeaker, and they exaggerate the difference between them when shown a colour chart. This is entirely psychological,\nof course, but entirely measurable too.\nLanguage also effects how you orientate yourself. While most languages use\nego centric coordinates (in front of, be-hind, left, right), some use the cardinal\ncoordinates of North, South East and\nWest in everyday language. In English\nyour right shoe will always be on your\nright foot, but to some Australian Aborigines you could wear a shoe on your\nNorth foot and turn around to find it\non your South foot. The fact that their\nlanguage sees these as different setups\nmeans that their concept of which two\nsituations are the same is quite different\nto those of us with ego- centric languag-es. A mirror image may not feel like a\nmirror image.\nThe effect of language on how we perceive gender is especially interesting to\nus Anglophones who aren\u2019t used to inanimate objects having a gender, as they\ndo in French and Spanish. It turns out\nthat although the allocation of gender to\na particular noun is random and varies\nbetween languages (\u201cbed\u201d is feminine\nin Spanish \u2014 la cama \u2013 and masculine\nin French \u2014 le lit); speakers actually associate human gender stereotypes with\nthose words. So when French speakers\nare asked to choose from a list of words\nto describe a bed, they choose masculine stereotypes like \u201cstrong\u201d whereas\nSpaniards will chose feminine stereotypes such as \u201cdelicate\u201d. Incredibly,\nthey make these associations even when\nspeaking in English \u2014 their mother\ntongue has \u201ctainted\u201d them.\nIn this short, entertaining and highly\nreadable book, Deutscher delves into all\nof these areas, concluding that people\nwho speak different languages really\ndo have a different perspective on the\nworld, albeit subtly different. But most\nexciting is that so many of these revelations have been made in recent decades-with advances in brain scanning techniques \u2013 the real treasures of linguistics\nmay be just on the horizon.\nRory Fenton\nThe Life Scientific\nThrough the language glass\nStudy links Facebook friends with brain regions\nA study by UCL researchers suggests\nthat the size of certain brain regions in an\nindividual may be linked to their number of Facebook friends. The researchers found a strong correlation between\nthe number of friends and the amount\nof grey matter in regions including the\namygdala, the right superior temporal\nsulcus, left middle temporal gyrus and\nthe right entorhinal cortex. The three latter regions were not, however, correlated\nto real-world friend networks.\nThese regions of the brain are associated with memory processing, emotional responses and perception, notably in\nidentifying objects as biological. A previous study suggested that the volume\nof grey matter in the amygdala is larger\nin people with greater real-world friend\nnetworks. This study suggests the same\nis true when referring to online friends.\nProfessor Geraint Rees, a Wellcome\nTrust Senior Clinical Research Fellow\nat UCL looked at MRI scans of the\nbrains of 125 university students who\nactively used Facebook and performed\nthe study taking into account the size of\ntheir real-world and online friend net-works. A strong link was found between\nthe number of Facebook friends an individual had and the amount of grey matter in the aforementioned parts of their\nbrain. The findings were replicated in a\ngroup of another 40 students and were\nlater published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\nThe researchers emphasise that this\ndoes not represent a causal link and it\nis not possible to determine from the\nstudy whether maintaining more Facebook friends results in greater volumes\nof grey matter or individuals that have\nlarger brain regions are hard-wired to\nhave more friends. Professor Rees said\nthat \u201conline social networks are massively influential, yet we understand\nvery little about the impact they have\non our brains\u201d. Dr Ryota Kanai, the first\nauthor of the study added \u201cthe exciting\nquestion now is whether these structures\nchange over time. This will help us answer the question of whether the internet is changing our brains\u201d.\nFacebook is the world\u2019s most popular\nsocial networking site with over 800\nmillion global active users. The study\nalso looked at how many real-world\nfriends an individual had compared to\ntheir Facebook friends, and showed\na positive correlation in that respect.\nIt involved asking participants questions such as \u201chow many friends are\nin your phonebook?\u201d, \u201chow many\npeople would you invite to a party?\u201d,\n\u201chow many friends have you kept from\nschool and university?\u201d and \u201chow\nmany friends do you have on Facebook?\u201d, allowing for an estimation of\nsocial network sizes.\nThe findings support the idea that\n\u201cmost Facebook users use the site to\nsupport their existing social relation-ships, maintaining or reinforcing these\nfriendships, rather than just creating networks of entirely new, virtual friends\u201d,\nProfessor Rees added. Students on average had around 300 Facebook friends,\nranging from 150 to 1,000.\nDr Heidi Johansen-Berg from the\nUniversity of Oxford noted the findings were intriguing but emphasised\nthat adding a large amount of Facebook\nfriends would not constitute a short cut\nto making people brainier. She added\nthe critique that \u201cthe number of Facebook friends you have [may be] more\nstrongly related to how much time you\nspend on the internet, how old you are,\nor what mobile phone you have\u201d, concluding that \u201cthe study cannot tell us\nwhether using the internet is good or\nbad for our brains\u201d.\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging seeks to understand the brain\nin greater detail, with scientists studying higher cognitive function in order\nto identify how thought and perception\narise from brain activity. Dr John Williams, head of Neuroscience and Mental Health at the Wellcome Trust said\n\u201cwe cannot escape the ubiquity of the\ninternet and its impact on our lives, yet\nwe understand little of its impact on the\nbrain, which we know is plastic and can\nchange over time\u201d.\nDOI: 10.1098/rspb.2011.1959\nAlex Karapetian\nxxx\nAncient Greeks called the sea \u201cblack\u201d because they had no word for blue\n\n"

A black silhouette of a car\nis racing at great speed down the\nrunway. Behind me a radio crackles and\nthe car turns off the runway, heading to\nwhere I\u2019m standing, engine warbling at\neach downshift.\nNow the noise is even louder, people\naround me have fingers in their ears. Earplugs are a must here. The driver pulls up\nand kills the engine. Immediately a half\ndozen men rush over with modified leaf\nblowers to stop the brakes catching fire.\nThey push the car back into a large gazebo\nthey\u2019ve erected for the test as a temporary\ngarage.\nInside there are more men with laptops,\na myriad of cables, a heap of tyres and an\narray of bodywork. There\u2019s even a spare\nengine tucked away in the corner. Geoff,\nthe race team coordinator who is showing\nme around, explains that on test days like\ntoday they only bring the bare minimum\nrequired. Just behind me are two motor\nhomes, filled with more equipment, and a\nsmall fleet of cars. Welcome to the world\nof Formula 1.\nToday Lotus Renault GP are testing\ntheir 2011 car. The driver climbs out of\nthe cockpit: it\u2019s Roman Grosjean. I smile\npolitely at him. He doesn\u2019t notice me.\nNever mind, because today I\u2019m here to\nget to know another part of the team that\nreceives much less media coverage: the\nengineers. These are the people that make\na team as fast as they are. Engineers for\nany team are expected to work evenings,\nweekends and are away from home most\nof the year, and yet the jobs are amongst\nsome of the most competitive in the busi-ness. So how do you become a Formula 1\nengineer, and what\u2019s it like?\nTo find out the answers I\u2019ve got an interview with an engineer. The test today is an\naerodynamic one so it only makes sense to\nchat to someone from aerodynamics, preferably with an Imperial connection. Dirk\nDeBeer is head of aerodynamics at Lotus Renault GP and Imperial Aeronautics\nalumni. That should suffice. Here\u2019s what\nhe had to say...\nHow did you get into engineering and\nFormula 1?\nI was always interested in motor racing\n\u2013 my father was keen on it and took me\nto Grand Prix. That\u2019s how I got a love for\nFormula 1. I\u2019ve always been interested in\naerodynamics, so the two go together. I\nwas always very keen - I did my homework and found out what the possibilities\nwere and results said Imperial College. At\nthat stage IC was very involved in Formula 1 aerodynamics, so I decided to go to\nImperial and got involved with the motor\nracing society there, which was with Prof.\nJohn Harvey and Peter Beerman.\nWhat advice would you give to an Imperial student intereseted in getting into\nF1 engineering?\nWhen I joined, the motor racing was a lot\nsmaller, it was more basic, it was only in-dividualsthatwereverykeen.Atthatstage\nwe even had F1 teams testing at Imperial\nCollege. You could get involved with that\nsort of thing. That has now changed ob-viously. To get into Formula 1 you have\nto excel in your degree; in fact, nowadays\nmost people have PhDs for aerodynamics\nin Formula 1. Other areas don\u2019t require\nPhDs as much.\nWhat was your career path?\nMine was rather tortuous and probably\nnot a typical one. While I was at Imperial\nI was the research assistant for the Honda\nteam\u2019s tunnel and got a lot of contacts in\nFormula 1 and motor racing. I\u2019m originally South African, I left South Africa\nbecause of the Apartheid. At the end of\nApartheid I went back to South Africa,\nspent a while there and eventually decided\nI\u2019d had enough there and wanted to get\nback into motor racing. I joined a team in\nAmerica where I had some contacts. Swift\nEngineering - they did Indy racing.\nThen there was a fall out between the\ncar manufacturer and the team running\nthe car. The manufacturer (who was head\nof aero while I was there) left and I ended\nup being the Head of Aerodynamics. So I\nwas thrown in at the deep end really, and it\nwas an unusual situation to be in.\nI stayed there until Swift decided to pull\nout of Indy racing and make Formula Atlantic cars, which I wasn\u2019t really into. I\nwas approached by Sauber in Switzerland\nwho were busy building a new wind tun-nel. They asked if I was prepared to come\nover and oversee the wind tunnel project,\nso I became the principal aerodynamicist\nat Sauber. I did that, but then BMW took\nover and I didn\u2019t really like that so I decided to see what other possibilities there\nwere. I moved to Renault in 2008, but not\nas Head as Aero, I become Head after the\nthen Head got very ill.\nWhat is your role within Lotus Renault\nGP as Head of Aerodynamics? As the\nHead of Department is the work more\nmanagerial?\nI generally don\u2019t go to race weekends;\nthere is an aerodynamic presence at the\ntrack of course, but I have to make decisions on which direction to take the team.\nThere is obviously the reality as you get\nto certain levels there are more and more\nmanagerial aspects which you can\u2019t es-cape. The reality of being in charge of a\ngroup of people is that there\u2019s quite a lot\nof management to be done.\nIs there a normal day in the office as\nHead of Aerodynamics?\nNot really, there are certain meetings and\ndiscussions, for example, the strategic direction and stuff like that. These are things\nthat are ongoing. There are discussions\nthat are important: like the results from\nthe previous day\u2019s test. There\u2019s certain\nstandard events. We have tunnels running\n24/7, gathering an enormous amount of\ndata so quite a lot of time is spent actually trying to get the best conclusions out\nof the data.\nLotus Renault GP had a superb start\nto the season, but it\u2019s not been going so\nwell of late. How does the team\u2019s performance affect you? Is that part of the\njob?\nThat is the reality of it. You\u2019re competing with a lot of other teams that have\nextremely smart people as well. Things\ndon\u2019t always go into place quite as you\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a war\nbetween us and the\nother teams.\u201d\nDriven enough for F1?\nJames Cronshaw talks to Formula 1 engineer Dirk DeBeer about all things motorsport\nIt\u2019s just like that film where Sylvester Stallone is a racing driver, except it\u2019s really, really not\nSix men. One car. No mercy. Or something.\nJames Cronshaw\nJames Cronshaw\nFEATURE\n6 FELIX\nFriday 28 OCTOBER 2011\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Luckily, our last defender was Tinkerbell who deftly\nstole the ball from the three of them as the Roehampton striker was about to pull the trigger.\nBetween our two centre-backs \u00dcnterbr\u00f8w\nand Tinkerbell and some assured ball distribution by holding midfielder Yellow Bag we constantly threatened their circle. After a shot was\nblocked on the goal-line by a Roehampton foot\nwe were awarded a penalty flick. Up stepped\nYellow Bag who eyed up the bottom left hand\ncorner, but in a moment of confusion ended\nHockey: Men\u2019s 2s victorious against Roehampton\nup firing straight down the middle. Thankfully\nthe Roehampton goalie had decided to dive\nand padded the ball down and into the goal,\nmaking it 2-0. We went in at half time having\nprobably played the best half of hockey ever,\nour goalie James had not even had to face a\nsingle shot at goal. B. Man Briggs\u2019 team talk,\nthough, ensured that our feet were still on the\nground.\nWe weren\u2019t quite finished toying with Roehampton. Their frustration was clearly beginning to show as attack after attack was being\ncrisply cleaned up by our team. Each time the\nball was recycled, we switched from defense to\noffense very quickly, and through the sterling\neffort of our new left-back Soggy Biscuit we\nplayed possession hockey. The breakthrough\nmoment came after ten minutes of the second\nhalf when a ball was smashed into the Roehampton circle and promptly deflected into the\ntop left hand corner by Teabag who was lurking in front of the goalie.\nAt 3-0 we started cruising and were duly pun-ished. A stray ball from midfield was pounced\non by the Roehampton striker and they scored\na breakaway goal.\nNot to be outdone by this, ICHC restarted\nplay with a flourish. A run from Strap-on down\nthe left set up Teabag to get his second goal of\nthe game. It finished with ICHC worthy winners and with extremely bright prospects for\nthe season ahead, and, dare I say it, promotion?\nRecord results for Surfsoc\nEvery October, the first BUCS event of the\nyear occurs in Newquay, where over 300 surfers from around the UK battle to be crowned\nchampions. The event is a hectic mix of epic\nsurfing and socialising and is the only competition the club can enter - so for everyone who is\ninvolved it\u2019s the only chance we get for glory!\nThis year the club has invested in more training time in Newquay to try and improve our\nperformance and with encouraging weather\nforecasts our team of 8 was eager to jump in\nthe bus early on Wednesday morning and get\nin the water! Unfortunately, Surfsoc legend\nSerkan had other plans and ensured the team\ndeparted 2 hours late.\nWhen we finally arrived in Newquay, everyone changed into wetsuits and hit the surf!\nStrong onshore winds and messy conditions\nmade for a frustrating session but everyone\nwas pleased to blow the cobwebs of the long\njourney away. We then checked into with our\nold friends at Newquay Backpackers and headed out for a team building meal and an early\nnight.\nThursday gave everyone a chance to hone\ntheir skills on the competition wave and practice surfing heats, which is very different to the\nfree surfing we\u2019re used to. The team were up\nearly and were rewarded with excellent early\nmorning conditions of 3-4 foot clean swell\nwith the occasional barrel. The famous Surfsoc\nairhorn was then used for its proper purpose\nfor the first time ever as 4 surfers practiced\ncompeting against one another for 15 minutes,\nwhich is very short time as we would all learn!\nAfter a long session, the team returned to the\ncompetition campsite; everyone then chipped\nin for a team dinner and had a friendly game of\npoker before another early night.\nThe competition started on Friday morning\nwith everyone due to compete that day. After\nregistering, everyone watched the conditions\nclosely and discussed tactics, mind games and\nways to make bails look like attempted airs.\nThe first round consisted of 15 minute heats of\n5 surfers, with the top 2 progressing to the next\nround. Independent judges watch each surfer\nand score each wave caught out of 10, each\nsurfers 2 best waves being counted.\nKhalil Rhazaoui was first to compete for\nImperial and was unlucky not to progress after\nfailing to back up a good first wave score and\ncame third. John \u201cJerkin\u201d Mcguckin and Elliot\n\u201cSharkbait\u201d Taylor were then in simultaneous\nheats and also both came close to qualifying\nbut were ousted on a split points decision by\nthe judges, similar to last year! Dario Mazza\nthen put in a solid performance complete with\nclaims but was up against two Cornwall locals\nand also eventually finished third in his heat.\nAdam \u201cHardcore\u201d Harvey and Hendrik \u201cHero\u201d\nFrentrup were then also in simultaneous heats.\nHendrik managed to qualify despite a dubious\ninterference, which was fantastic news and\nmade everyone in the team very happy. After\na long wait, Julius Klein and Thom Utley were\ncheered on by the rest of the club in almost perfect conditions but were unable to match the\nhigh qualifying standard. Everyone then piled\ninto the surf to enjoy a chilled session that was\ncut short by a nasty fin slash on Elliot\u2019s ankle\nresulting in some brutal looking stitches. The\nteam then considerately left Hendrik to sleep\nand prepare for the second round the next day\nby spending the night in the infamous Sailors\nclub in Newquay to celebrate a successful day.\nEveryone made it down to the beach the next\nmorning to cheer in Hendrik who was unfortunate not to get through his second round\nheat. The team then all enjoyed a free sports\nmassage courtesy, and once again headed out\nto enjoy the excellent conditions without the\npressure of competition. After an awesome day\nand many dubious photos, the team returned to\nthe campsite for the closing party.\nSunday dawned with sore heads for everyone and after a quick freesurf at Whipsiderry\nbeach everyone watched Super Gordon Fontaine from Bournemouth win the competition\nfor the third consecutive year with impressive\nturns and airs. The team then assisted Surfers\nAgainst Sewage with a beach clean before the\nlast team lunch and journey home.\nThecompetitionwasgreatfunforeveryonewith\nthe blessing of good conditions and good banter,\neveryone had a weekend to remember and hopefully next year the team can perform even better!\nInterested in surfing?

    "content": "FELIX\n26\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nJames Simpson\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 October 2011\nI\nhave been a huge fan of The Apprentice since the UK version debuted back\nin 2004. I\u2019m certainly not the only one,\nwith the finale of the last season having\nmore than ten million viewers. I suspect\nthat for most people the main draw has been the\nconsistent incompetence of the candidates and\nthe resulting boardroom meetings with a furious\nLord Sugar. While the tasks in last year\u2019s Junior\nApprentice were generally of the smaller scale\nand Sugar was far more restrained than usual,\nthere was no shortage of what made the original great. The second series of the show, which\nbegan this Monday and has now been wisely renamed Young Apprentice, looks set to continue\nin the first\u2019s fine tradition.\nAs always the show opens with a montage of\ngeneric shots of the candidates walking away\nfrom home, luggage in hand, culminating in a\ngroup shot of everyone marching down a deserted Millennium Footbridge. I wonder how many\ncommuters and tourists were inconvenienced by\nclosing the bridge to film a scene that lasts no\nlonger than five seconds? This is all intercut with\nthe candidates\u2019 over-confident and pretentious\nquotes about themselves. Highlights include:\n\u201cI\u2019m not focused on making friends. I\u2019m focused\non getting to my goals\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m a risky person.You\nlike it or you don\u2019t. I\u2019m like marmite.\u201d and \u201cI\ngot eight A stars, two A\u2019s. No one intimidates\nme because I know I\u2019m better than them.\u201d. This\nis becomes doubly hilarious when we move to\nthe boardroom and see Sugar telling them not\nto \u201cpretend [they] know it all because it will be\nembarrassing\u201d.\nHere we first get to the return of another Apprentice staple, Lord Sugar\u2019s atrocious jokes,\nas he continues on to say that it would be \u201cas\nembarrassing as if Nick and I put on a cap and\nstarted to rap\u201d. Of course, all of the terrified\nsixteen and seventeen year olds laugh. Eventually Sugar reveals the challenge, which is, as the\nepisodes title suggests, to make and sell \u201cfrozen\ntreats\u201d. We soon learn that bad comedy isn\u2019t the\nsole preserve of Lord Sugar as the voiceover informs us that \u201cice cream [is] a market worth a\ncool one billion [and] to scoop some of that up\nthey\u2019ll have to think up something special\u201d.\nWith the teams chosen, as always in the first\nchallenge it is girls against boys, they then go\nPick of the week\nThey\u2019re definitely not the\nsame as last week.

Here\nwe get to feel the feel the editor\u2019s hand when the\nonly things the boys ask each other on their car\njourney is where they live, what business experience they have and what skills they possess \u2014\nunless they really are that boring.\nThe teams\u2019 first decision is what to call them-selves. The boys quickly settle on the name\n\u2018Atomic\u2019, an interesting choice for a company\nthat is going to be selling food. Apparently one\nof reasons for the choice was because it sounds\n\u201cmysterious\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d. The girls consider \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019and \u2018Core\u2019, one of them suggesting that the latter is a good idea since \u201cthe Earth\nand the Sun have a core and for you to have the\nSun you need a core\u201d. Eventually though, they\nsettle on the more generic name \u2018Kinetic\u2019. The\ngirls then manage to convince Hayley to project\nmanage since she \u201creally enjoys cooking\u201d. The\nboys have less luck with Lewis who, despite\nimpressive sales experience, decides that he\ndoesn\u2019t want to lead the team. The job is taken\nby Harry instead.\nWhen it comes down to making ice cream the\ngirls came up with the interesting idea of mixing something \u201chealthy with chocolate\u201d. This\nresulted in, amongst others, a chocolate-banana\nflavour and an eye catching, if not entirely ac-curate, slogan of \u201ctreat the lips \u2013 trim the hips\u201d.\nThey decide to make as much ice-cream as\nthey can manage in the time that they\u2019ve got\nbut a miscalculation means that they don\u2019t buy\nenough fruit and have to bin thirty litres of their\nmix. They make up for this however with exorbitant prices, including charging extra for a\ncone, and other rather unethical business practice such. These include adding expensive toppings to ice cream even if the customer doesn\u2019t\nask for them and letting small children pick out\nthe most expensive options while their parents\naren\u2019t looking.\nDespite some early problems with the cream\nmachines and a rather unusual apple-watermel-on frozen yogurt flavour, the boys do manage\nto come up with a quite effective pirate theme,\ncomplete with a mobile kiosk painted to look\nlike a treasure chest \u2013 all quite appropriate for\ntheir seaside selling location. I do, however,\nhave to admit that their \u201cShiverrr me timbers\u201d\n(misspelling apparently intentional) slogan was\nquite cringeworthy. They go for the opposite\nstrategy to the girls, undercutting competition on\nthe beachfront with \u00a31.50 for one scoop and \u00a32\nfor two.\nBack in the boardroom it is revealed that,\ndespite the boys selling out of stock, the girls\u2019\nprofits exceeded theirs by almost \u00a3150. Perhaps\nthey should have tried exploiting their customers\ntoo. Harry decides to bring James and Mahamed\nback into the boardroom with him to face being fired by Sugar. Of the two, James managed\nto prove that being joint first in Ireland in Economics doesn\u2019t make you a good businessman\nby having suggested at the start of the day that\nprices should be slashed to \u00a31 while Mahamed\nwas the worst salesperson despite claiming to\nhave been the best. It\u2019s a shame that somebody\nhad to be fired as I\u2019m sure that both would have\nbeen very entertaining in future episodes but,\nunfortunately, we did have to see Mahamed go.\nAll in all, this was a typically brilliant episode.\nYou won\u2019t normally learn how to run a successful business by watching the Apprentice or its\nspin off but you\u2019ll certainly learn what not to do\nand have a good laugh.\n\u201cI got eight A stars, two\nA\u2019s.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 28 october 2011 19\nYes \u2013 James Clough No \u2013 Ed Middleton\nIC Debating Society asks ...\nP\nublic sector workers do the jobs that\nwe deem to be so important that taxpayers cannot exempt themselves\nfrom paying for them. We rely upon\nthe NHS, police force and public\ntransport every day; they are essential parts of\nour lives and without them society would be\ncompletely different.\nPublic sector jobs are fundamentally different\nto private sector jobs because the customer \u2013 the\ntaxpayer \u2013 cannot decide to stop paying if they\nget service they do not like. If all the firemen go\non strike, you cannot stop paying the part of your\ntaxes that pay for the fire department just because you are no longer receiving their service.\nThere are benefits to working in the public sector in the UK. Your employer is very unlikely\nto go bankrupt and stop paying you. Many believe that public sector workers will, on balance,\nreceive a better pay and pension package than\nthey would get in a similar private sector job.\nFor example, Tube drivers will soon earn over\n\u00a350,000 per year. Performing work that does a\nsocial good is another reason many people desire\npublic sector jobs \u2013 they feel like they are making a difference. But is it reasonable to expect a\nsecure, well-paid and fulfilling job while still retaining all of the benefits workers in the private\nsector receive?\nBecause the customer cannot stop paying, and\ninstead use a competitor like they can in the private sector, the public sector workers are capable of holding the general public to ransom. If\nthey strike, there is nothing that the public can\ndo about it. Large public sector unions mean\nthat the public sector workers wield an immense\namount of power. They can bring down the gov-ernment; the government that everyone else has\nfreely and fairly elected.\nMore worryingly, the leverage that the public\nsector holds is that the people who are hurt when\nthey withdraw from their duties are not the rich\nand powerful, but children, hospital patients, and\nthe poorest in society. When they strike, they\nare telling the government, and by extension the\nentire electorate, that unless they get what they\nwant, they will let the most vulnerable people in\nsociety get hurt. It is unacceptable for the people\nwho are entrusted with, and rewarded for, protecting those in need to neglect their duties and\njust walk away.\nIt also hurts the workers themselves: the public\ngrow resentful of them, and lose their faith in the\nidea that the public sector exists to help them. Increasingly, people support cracking down on the\nunions and in the long run this can hurt everyone\ninvolved. Without the trust of the population the\npublic sector cannot function. Policemen who\nare respected and trusted are far more effective\nthan policemen who are seen as interested purely\nin their own pay.\nYou might say that the right to strike is an important way of keeping the government in check,\nof protecting workers\u2019 rights or of maintaining\nhigh standards \u2013 but this is wrong. The public\nsector already has a mechanism to do all of these\nthings: they are decided by the electorate. It is\nthe voters who ought to decide how much teachers get paid, what police pensions should be, or\nhow long nurses should work. The voters are the\nones who pay for it and the entire legitimacy of\nthe public sector stems from the fact that they\nare working for a democratically elected gov-ernment; the public sector workers do not have\nthe right to overrule the rest of the people in the\ncountry.\nWhen they strike they hurt the public sector as\na whole. They hurt the taxpayer. They hurt the\npeople in society who most need their help. It is\nunfair and unethical for the public sector to hold\nthe country to ransom; if you want to work for\nthe state then you must accept that the voters are\nin charge and to try and go against their wishes\nis just unacceptable.\nI\nt is important to make the distinction between whether public sector workers are\nmaking the right decision to strike at a\ncertain time and whether they should be\nable to strike. Clearly no right-minded\nindividual would advocate unnecessary or unreasonable striking, but I will aim to show you why\nit is important that striking is an option for those\nin the public sector.\nPublic sector workers are in the unique position\nof having the same body paying their wages as\nensuring they are paid fairly. The government,\nemploying public sector workers, has an incentive to keep costs down: if costs were driven too\nhigh, anger from the general public (comprising\npredominantly private sector workers) would be\nexpressed at the ballot box and lead to the election of parties with more thrifty attitudes towards\npay. Unfortunately, due to the nature of public\nsector work, the options left for workers to express their discontentment are very limited.\nThe public sector tends to consist of large, national organisations with extensive power struc-tures. Because of this, individuals working on the\nlower rungs of the employment ladder become\none of many voiceless worker bees with little or\nno access to the Queen Bee. It is very difficult for\nthe majority of public sector workers to engage\nin a meaningful discussion with those responsible\nfor determining their salaries and working envi-ronment. In the private sector, though workers\nmay be in a large industry, there is a much higher\nexposure to the managers that determine their\npay. Private sector industries are also held accountable to government bodies that are entirely\nindependent, and can act as third party arbiters in\nany employment negotiations. For this reason, it\nis much more important for public sector workers\nto have clear and visible forms of mass protest\nagainst unacceptable working conditions.\nAnother feature of public sector work that\nmakes striking so important is its vocational na-ture. A lot of the workers have picked careers that\ninvolve varying degrees of specialist training,\nand have dedicated their lives to using these skills\nto earn a living. However, unlike private sector\nworkers in similar lines of work, there are no alternative providers. This means that skilled workers with specialised talents are forced to work for\na single provider; one that is not accountable to\nan independent body and is incentivised towards\nlower pay. Also, because of this, public sector\nworkers tend to work long careers with the same\nemployer. As such, any changes to their contract\nwill have lasting effects for the worker\u2019s entire\ncareer.\nFinally, the concern that the vital nature of public sector work would give them unjustified power\nin striking is an assertion that does not hold up to\nscrutiny. Public sector jobs are important, but society can survive without them. Most public sector jobs exist in industries where national co-or-dination makes for a better service: a nationalised\nhealth service, for instance, is many times more\nefficient than a private one; or in sectors where\nit is advantageous to have organizations working\nfor quality not profit. They do not solely consist\nof \u201cvital\u201d industries. True, public sector striking\nis inconvenient to many; but it is not unmanage-able, and this is not a reason to disallow workers\nfrom striking. Furthermore, as discussed above,\nmany public sector employees have chosen their\njob as a vocation; it is something they care about.\nThis non-financial incentive for work means that\nmany public sector workers already accept longer\nworking hours and less pay for the work they do,\nand would be inclined to strike only when their\nsituation became very severe.\nAs stated above, while there may be situations\nwhere it is inappropriate for public sector workers\nto strike, it is essential that they have the option\nto do so. It should be used as a last resort, but one\nthat can be deployed to ensure the fair treatment\nand employment status of everyone in Britain.\n\u201cShould public sector strikes and\nmass action be stopped?\u201d\n\u201c \u201d\nIt is unfair and\nunethical for the\npublic sector to\nhold the country to\nransom \u201c \u201d\nTrue, public\nsector striking is\ninconvenient to\nmany; but it is not\nunmanageable\n\n"

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\n12\nBusiness Editors: Nina Kearsey\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 October 2011\nJust before the BlackBerry service collapse on\nOctober 10, the analyst firm Enterprise Management Associates conducted extensive research regarding the trend in enterprise mobile\ndevice management. This research concluded\nthat more than 30% of BlackBerry users from\nwithin large enterprises are expected to move\nto different platforms within a year as a result\nof poor user satisfaction. Despite the growing\npopularity of the device in UK teenage market\n(largely due to the success of the BlackBerry\nMessenger application, BBM, which allows\nusers to avoid instant messaging costs), the recent BlackBerry \u201cblack out\u201d will likely accelerate the decline of Research in Motion\u2019s (RIM,\nthe maker of the BlackBerry device) market\nshare at enterprise level. The question is, can\nApple\u2019s iPhone and iOS platform can now take\nover BlackBerry\u2019s piece of the marketplace\nfollowing the death of its founder Steve Jobs,\nor will it instead follow Blackberry\u2019s footsteps\ntowards decline?\nRecent statistics from Kantar Worldpanel\nComTech news on smartphone operating\nsystems\u2019 market share has shown that while\nNokia\u2019s Symbian platform and RIM\u2019s market\nshare in major countries are declining, Apple\u2019s\niOS has failed to grasp the opportunity to ex-pand. In fact, iOS have only made significant\ngains in US market share, while their market\nshare in UK, Japan, Germany and France has\ndropped drastically. Conversely, the competing\nAndroid operating system has outperformed\nApple iOS in every market, with Samsung,\nHTC, Nokia and Motorola as key players competing with iPhone for the smartphone market.\nStill, Apple maintains its dominance in the\nmobile application store market. Figures from\n2010 show the Apple App Store generated\n$1.8bn in revenue that year - 82.7% of the\ntotal market. Though the competing Android\noperating system is more popular than iOS,\napplication developers are more satisfied with\nthe Apple market\u2019s ecosystem. A recent survey\nfrom US Yankee group and Skyhook shows\nthat developers were dissatisfied with the lack\nof regulation in Android application market,\nbemoaning the piracy that eats away from their\nprofit. Another survey from research firm IDC\nand mobile software company Appcelertor\nshowed that developers are shying away from\nAndroid, viewing the platform as still too frag-mented, and seeking more reliable profits in\nthe Apple market place. Statistics from Furry\nconfirmed the view, in which out of 10,200 application projects developed in the 2nd quarter\n(Q2) of 2011, 72% were for Apple iOS while\nonly 28% were for Android, indicating more\ndevelopment will take place on the iOS plat-form.\nApple dominates, too, in user satisfaction.\nA recent survey by J.D. Power and Associates\nranked Apple above every other smartphone\nmanufacturer in customer satisfaction, scoring\nhighly in key areas of performance, ease of op-eration, features and physical design. A loyal\nfanbase is critical to Apple\u2019s continuing success \u2013 as suggested by the Worldpanel report,\nboth Apple and Android\u2019s users are loyal when\nchoosing upgrades, due partly to their investments in mobile applications.\nWith an increasing number of companies\ncoming out with competitive smartphone de-vices, what differentiates iPhone from the rest\nof the pack will be its operating system. Here,\nApple\u2019s weakness in terms of flexibility is actually what contributes to their strength. While\nnew customers might be moving away for lack\nof product variability, little integration with the\nWindows OS, and expensive application costs\ncompared to Android, Apple still manages to\nrake in a high profit margin from their prod-How Apple\u2019s iPhone stands in\nthe current market,\nor: \u2018How we Apples swim\u2019\nShiang-Jin Chin\nucts. Their rigid combination of the iPhone\nhardware and iOS software ensures those qualities of performance, ease of use, and physical\ndesign, that result in such high approval ratings\nwith their users.

Next opponent is Oxford,\nthe match that matters. The girls are\naware of what\u2019s ahead and gear up for\na tough fight. About an hour later, the\nImperial team is standing there looking at each other, wondering what just\nhappened. Oxford didn\u2019t seem like\nthey cared, they had barely tried to\nwin. Instead it had been very easy for\nAlice, Emily and Charlotte and they\nhad won 45-25, leading to the overall\nresult 123-96.\nBy this time, it was only two matches left before the minibus could return\nto London. Cambridge scored many\nhits but never really threatened, epee\nended 45-42 and the match 135-74\noverall. Queen Mary saw themselves\ndefeated by 45-31, the overall score\nlanding at 135-63, and it was finally\ntime to go home. With the weekend\nfinished, the team was very pleased\nwith another clean swipe and has now\nset the focus to the Championship\nknock-out match coming up.\n...Continued from back page\nFencing against a backdrop of cinderblocks. That\u2019s Cambridge for you\nOn Sunday 23th October, the Imperial\nWolverines enjoyed an unexpected 3rd\nplace finish in the 16 team South Coast\nOpen, butchering some of the countries\nbest dodgeball teams on the way.\nThe wolverine-pack started the day\nslowly with lone wolf Quang \u2018throw\nwith a bang\u2019 Hui missing the train and\nteam Captain Alan \u2018sensei\u2019 Soltani recovering from his nocturnal lifestyle.\nThe team had a harsh awakening\nagainst fierce rivals and universally\nunpopular Minotaur Dodgeball. Imperial lost 3-1 (matches are out of 5); a\ndisappointing scoreline but a deserved\nwin for the Minotaurs after taking us by\nsurprise with some high quality play.\nThe Wolverines soon bounced back\nrecording two comfortable 5-0 victories\nagainst Southampton Buckaneers and\nPortsmouth Purple Cobras C. Dodgeball pin up Steve \u2018Chabal\u2019 Ndumbe\nstood about for most of each game\nand then pulled off some expert pressure catching and funky court moves,\nplaying majestically in the last thirty\nseconds of each game. The Imperial\nWolverines eventuallly made it into the\nquarter-finals where they would face\nthe Jammy Dodgers - Britain\u2019s second\nbest team.\nIn this match Scott \u2018beef generator\u2019\nEsnouf and Wolverine of the tournament Thomas \u2018The Doctor\u2019 Peake\nexcelled. These two pulled off some\nclinical counter-attacking moves complimented by a great catching display\nby \u2018Big Al\u2019 Soltani and the ever in-fallible, inscrutable and irrepressible\nAdam \u2018Ash\u2019 Cutmore. The wolverine-pack posted a 3-1 win against JD and\nprogressed into the semi-final where\nthey would meet a strong, well-rounded\nSouthampton Pirates side.\nHere, Alan made the ingenious decision of bringing back on the big guns\nof Luke \u2018Andy Murray\u2019 Barron - a ball\nmagnet, and Quang \u2018lucky charm\u2019 Hui\nwho dodged like a champion, allowing the rest of the team and especially\nDoctor Peake to execute a good hitting\ngame. Imperial raced to a 3-1 scoreline\nneeding just one more game to make\nit into the final. Unfortunately, the\nSouthampton Pirates, one of the nicest\nteams around, just didn\u2019t know when to\nlie down and get ball battered. Out of\nnothing, they fought back to a 4-3 win.\nImperial dropped to their knees as the\nteam narrowly missed out on their first\never final...heart-breaking stuff.\nThe Wolverines picked themselves\nback up and had a few minutes to\nprepare before the best-of-7 3rd / 4th\nplayoff \u2013 the battle for bronze. As if it\nwas written in the stars, the team staring at us 50 feet away was none other\nthan the always angry Minotaurs. In\nthe first game, the Minotaurs cheekily\nleft out their two best players and were\nduly punished. With the court volume\nrising, Imperial ground out a 2-1 lead,\nneeding 2 more games for bronze. The\nnext game defined controversial. Alan\n\u2018Woody\u2019 Soltani clearly hit a really\nangry ginger dude on the foot and he\nproceeded to give the finger and refuse\nto go out. The Minotaurs got a taste of\ntheir own medicine with the 30+ crowd\ncheering every time one of them was\neliminated. As the whistle sounded,\nthe referees had decided the game was\ndrawn but after much Minotaur moaning the decision was overturned. 2-2.\nImperial remained unfazed. The team\nhad caught the scent of a lesser beast\nin their nostrils. In the next two games,\nthe well organised, gargantuan Imperial side flourished, obliterating the\nMinotaurs. Doctor Peake making some\nmagical, uncharacteristic catches. 4-2.\nA bronze medal finish. The celebrations were wild.

    "content": "FILM\nFELIX\n28\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 OCTOBER 2011\nIt\u2019s rare for a disaster scenario to make for a\ndecent film let alone a great one, so it is with a\nsense of relief that I report that Contagion rises\nabove the majority of its siblings to provide an\nunusually subtle 106 minutes of entertainment.\nDirector Stephen Soderbergh adopts an almost documentary-style structure to his story\nof a new global pandemic of flu-like virus. The\nviewer follows the parallel stories of the husband (Matt Damon) of Patient Zero (Gwyneth\nPaltrow), an epidemiologist searching for the\nsource of the outbreak in China (Marion Cotillard), a walking Julian Assange reference (Jude\nLaw), and the team of scientists at the American Centre for Disease Control (Laurence\nFishburne, Kate Winslet) trying to develop\na vaccine. As these characters go about their\nstruggles, society starts to buckle under the\nstrain of the high death toll.\nParanoia is the theme and motif here \u2013 with a\nlot of lingering shots of door handles and drinking glasses that have been smeared with traces\nof infected bodily fluids. This is mildly unset-tling, if a little obvious. More impressive is the\nhandling of scenes of public disorder, which are\ngiven a lighter touch than in many a comparable apocalypse. The direction maintains pace\nwell and the script, while not crackling with\nwit, is far from abysmal and creates a sense that\nIn brief\nThe BFI London Film Festival\nLeicester Square, a sunny Saturday afternoon,\nthe usual mayhem caused by tourists and the fact\nthat most of the square is actually shut for construction works, but something else is different.\nNames are being whispered in the chaos; some\nsay Keira Knightley is about to appear, others Madonna or Jack Black (actually none of them did\nthat day). Someone (I assume) famous strolls\ndown the red carpet in a flurry of camera flashes.\nAll the cinemas advertise the intriguing \u201cBFI London Film Festival\u201d. The red carpets are out, photographers and passers-by crowd around them.\nThe film festival is on! Sat in a dark room, the\ncurtains open and Jack Black begins demonstrating how to groom a corpse.\nOpening on October 12 with Fernando Meirelles\u2019\n360, the BFI London Film Festival brings to London a fabulous selection of 204 features and 110\nshorts from 55 countries. 360, written by Peter\nMorgan (The Queen), set the trend for this year\u2019s\nfestival. It is a story of relationships and connections in the globalised 21st Century taking place\nin Vienna, London, Paris, Rio, Denver, Phoenix and\nBratislava and showcasing some of Britain\u2019s finest talent with a sizzling Jude Law, sexy Rachel\nWeisz and seasoned Anthony Hopkins as the lead\nactors.\nThis event is more than just glitz and glamour in\ncentral London. Some of the most awaited films\nof the season were screened in Leicester Square\nwith the critically acclaimed We Need to Talk about\nKevin (out now in cinemas), The Ides of March\n(or when George Clooney multi-tasks), A Dangerous Method and The Descendants. In addition,\na number of restored classics were screened at\nthe BFI Southbank centre as well as foreign films\nthat would probably never hit a screen in Britain.\nA samurai film, a documentary following Sarah\nPalin, or dark cancer-related humour, there was\nsomething for every taste and mood.\nLast night the festival closed, on a British note\nwith The Deep Blue Sea directed by Terence Davies, at least until next year for more intriguing\nfeatures and discoveries. Also, we now have the\ncertainty that Clooney won\u2019t do a Schwarzie and\nrun for election, or so the Evening Standard says.\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nJerzy Hoffman might not be the most famous of Polish film directors but he has\ncertainly shown himself to be competent in\nthe past, most notably in his adaptations of\nHenryk Sienkiewicz\u2019s epic Trilogy (With\nFire and Sword, The Deluge and Colonel\nWo\u0142odyjowski). Therefore, despite its relatively poor critical reception, I was quite\nhopeful for his latest work Battle of Warsaw\n1920 3D, which has received a surprisingly\nwide UK release. Unfortunately, I was to be\ndisappointed.\nThe Battle of Warsaw is considered by many\nto have been the decisive battle in the PolishSoviet war of 1919-1921, in which the Polish\narmy managed to rout the Bolshevik forces,\nwho previously been considered unstoppable.\nThis could have made an interesting film and,\nwhile Hoffman\u2019s effort is not entirely without merit, a combination of heavy handedness\nand overacting make what was supposed to be\na serious war movie feel like a cross between\na propaganda film and a comedy.\nTake, for example, one of the first scenes\nin the film, when we see Lenin discussing\nthe War with the Politburo. He makes the clich\u00e9d \u201cfirst Poland, then Europe, then World\u201d\nspeech, after which there is literally the sound\nof thunder and a flash of red before we move\non to the title screen. Hoffman did the same\ntrick when introducing the main antagonist,\nChmielnicki, in With Fire and Sword but at\nleast Chmielnicki had some depth, rather than\nbeing nothing more than a cheap comic book\nvillain, like Lenin is here.\nSome would argue that we should not have\nexpected objectivity from a Polish made film\nabout this topic but that\u2019s not really the problem here. The Trilogy films weren\u2019t at all objective but, unlike this movie, they were at\nleast competently made. The Deluge even received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign\nLanguage Film.\nBattle of Warsaw doesn\u2019t even seem to have\na proper antagonist. Lenin is far too distant a\nfigure for him to directly affect the protagonists \u2014 a cavalry officer and his new wife \u2014\nand while Cheka agent Bykowski looks set to\ntake the role he is killed off about half way\nthrough. Arguably a war movie doesn\u2019t need\na direct antagonist but the absence of one is\nonly a sign of deeper structural and pacing\nflaws. A lot of the film just doesn\u2019t flow well\nand, most damningly of all, the battle itself is\npushed right to the very end. We get to witness\nboth sides planning but when the time comes\nwe only see some soldiers defending a trench\nand a cavalry charge \u2014 and then it\u2019s over. We\nreally get no feel for the battle, no real idea\nof how it progressed and what happened. The\ntitular battle is almost an afterthought.\nOn the technical side the film certainly\nlooks good. The 3D is mostly competently\ndone, though it does get very distracting during the faster paced sequences. Hoffman also\nincluded far too many slow motion shots,\nwhich, together with soundtrack, really add\nto the ridiculously over-dramatic feel of the\nscenes in which they are used.\nIn short, the film has very little to say about\nthe overarching war plot and while several\nscenes almost make you feel for the smaller\nscale story of our protagonists, these moments are ruined by the director\u2019s inability to\nshow restraint. This is one of the most hilariously awful films that I\u2019ve seen this year.\nthese are real people.\nThese slick touches aside, the film has a\nnumber of flaws. This is not an actors\u2019 movie\nin spite of its star-studded cast. Fishburne, Damon, Cotillard et al all sacrifice depth of character to the overall structure and tone of the\nfilm. In particular, Soderbergh has no problem\nkilling off big names. Paltrow dies within the\nfirst few minutes and the repeated video-tape\nflashbacks of the events leading up to her death\nseem to do nothing more than justify her wage\nfor such a small role.\nWhile all the major players are disciplined\nenough not to be bombastic or over-emphasise\ntheir presence, the lack of examination of their\nmotivations and emotional response to the crisis is frustrating, particularly towards the end.\nWe are not invited to sympathise with anyone\nto a significant degree, and are not expected to\ncare overly when some of the plot-strands are\nleft hanging because they no longer provided a\nplatform for commentary on the wider scope of\nevents. Soderbergh has not quite achieved his\naim of making us forget that these characters\nare vehicles for the story, as opposed to the focus of it. But he does a significantly better job\nthan the directors of similar films like The Day\nAfter Tomorrow or 2012.\nOf course, there are only two possible out-comes: the world ends, or everything goes back\nto normal. In either case it can be tempting to\nask the question \u201cWell what was the point of\nthat?\u201d and Contagion is no exception. Ironically\nfor what was intended to be a sort-of cautionary\ntale about disease and, to an extent, globalisa-tion, I came away feeling distinctly reassured.\nThe CDC react to the outbreak in a professional\nand efficient manner, without being so perfect\nas to make it appear a propaganda piece. It\nlooks like this is about the worst such a situation could get, and I could imagine a lot worse.\nIn summary, Contagion is not going to move\nyou to tears, nor yelps of laughter or fear. But\nfor an afternoon of sharp and smart entertainment with a healthy respect for realism, you\ncould do a lot worse.\nOnly 3 mins of Gwyneth... the rest\u2019s OK\nA disgraceful portrayal of the Battle of Warsaw\nHenry Turner-Chambers\nDirector Steven Soderbergh\nScreenwriter Scott Z.

    "content": "John Park\nFILM\nFELIX Friday 28 OCTOBER 2011 29\n\u201cChange begins with a whisper\u201d\nHere is this year\u2019s answer to The Blind\nSide. A feel-good movie that looks at\ncontroversial issues involving white\nguilt and somehow ends up being the\nyear\u2019s most watchable, straightforward\nfilms. The only difference is that if any\nof the cast for The Help do score some\nawards for their performances, similar to what Sandra Bullock managed\nto swing in 2010, the women of \u201cThe\nHelp\u201d would actually deserve the shiny\nstatuettes.\nThe complex issue The Help deals\nwith is racism, and the idea of hired\nhelp in 1960s America \u2013 or more spe-cifically, the use and treatment of black\nmaids with the shockingly popular\nterm \u201cseparate but equal\u201d being used\nto segregate black Americans. The\nhelp, required to cook, clean, shop and\nraise children for their white, superior\nbosses, do so to make ends meet. Condescending tone, demeaning gestures\nand verbal abuse are commonplace, but\nto earn 95 cents per hour, these women\nwork morning, noon and night, in a\nsociety that refuses to fully embrace\nthem.\nAibileen Clark (Viola Davis) has\nraised and parted with more than a\ndozen children. Having lost her own\nchild not too long ago, she finds it ever\nmore painful, and the discrimination\nshe faces from a household she dedicates herself to (she even has a separate\ntoilet because the owners fear they will\ncatch some unknown disease) is unconscionable in our eyes, but she accepts it\nsince she has faced this kind of behaviour every day. Minny Jackson (Octavia\nSpencer) is a maid whose frank words\nand bold attitude have garnered her a\nreputation for being difficult. Minny\u2019s\nboss, the evil Hilly Holbrook (Bryce\nDallas Howard), is a nasty piece of\nwork who poisons her suburban neighbourhood with her snobbish, arrogant\nwords. Seeing the maids\u2019 everyday\nstruggle and deciding to do something\nabout this is Eugina \u201cSkeeter\u201d Phelan\n(Emma Stone), a brave young graduate\nwho wishes to write a book chronicling\nthe daily hardship faced by the hired\nhelp. A lot of people around her seem to\nbe ignoring the racial inequality she so\nclearly sees, including her own mother,\nCharlotte (Allison Janney).\nAre white people evil for employing black maids? The film is correct\nin showing us that not everything can\nbe summed up that simply. Sure the\ncharacter of Hilly Holbrook, the film\u2019s\nmain antagonist, is drawn with a hint of\ncomical caricature, but the rest of the\ncast represents something more com-plicated, and the white employers are\nfar from hateful.\nThere is a cloud of mystery created\nas Skeeter discovers her beloved childhood maid, Constantine (the invaluable Cicely Tyson), has simply disap-peared. Her mother refuses to give her\na straight answer. When we finally do\nsee what really happened, it turns into\none of the most heart-breaking scenes\nin the film, with unforgettable performances from Janney, Stone and Tyson,\nespecially.\nDavis, who in supporting roles has\nbeen consistently excellent no matter\nwhat genre, gives an even more stirring\nperformance as she is given a bigger\npart. She is always so full of love and\nis more than committed \u2013 she is good at\nher job, too, as she takes care of those\naround her with much warmth and\ncompassion. Minny is someone who\nwill generate more laughs, with Spencer delivering that right mix of tough,\nno-nonsense woman whilst showing\nempathy to those she deems deserving.\nMinny ends up with a new boss,\nand it turns out that Celia Foote (Jes-sica Chastain) is the polar opposite of\nHilly. Celia is a cheerful but clueless\nand insecure housewife who is desperate to please her well-off husband. She\nand Minny bond, and as that unlikely\nfriendship develops, the audience also\nlearns that white people have difficulties of their own, and seeing Spencer\nlower her defense to someone she\nnever thought would be her \u201cequal\u201d is\na change grasped well by the otherwise\nstraight-talking, hilarious Spencer. And\nChastain, who is having one heck of a\nyear with a long line of impressive performances stacking up to her glowing\nresume, can count this one in too.\nSure, it is undeniably too neat; but\nthis is a feel-good movie, which is why\neverything is so tidy and the director\n(Tate Taylor) refuses to get his hands\ndirty. The script is somewhat restricted\nin its portrayal of a wider communi-ty, and rushes into tying up the loose\nends with a convenient, feel-good set\nof answers. But the important thing is\nwe care about the characters \u2013 black\nor white, discrimination is wrong, and\nmany heart-felt, uplifting scenes show\nus this and its message could not be\nclearer.\n10 Films to\nWatch from\nthis year\u2019s BFI\nLondon Film\nFestival\nCorolianus \u2013 Ralph Fiennes\u2019 directorial debut\nbased on Shakespeare\u2019s\nplay and transposed to\nthe modern day Balkans\nThe Ides of March \u2013 A\nsmart, well-acted political drama directed by\nGeorge Clooney\nThe Artist \u2013 A silent film\nabout cinema starring\nthis year\u2019s Cannes Best\nActor Award Jean Dujardin\nThe Kid with a Bike \u2013\nThe Dardenne Brothers\u2019\nnew heartbreaking rollercoaster ride of emotions\nTales of the Night \u2013 A\nmagic world of fairytales\nin silhouette animation\nbrought to you by the creators of Li and the Poet,\nand Kirikou\nMedianeras \u2013 Gustavo\nTaretto\u2019s full-length debut feature, looking at a\nmodern day romantic-comedy taking place in\nBuenos Aires\nDreams of a Life \u2013 A mysterious film where a young\nwoman is discovered in a\nLondon flat three years\nafter her death\nThis Must be the Place\n\u2013 Sean Penn becomes\nan eccentric rock star in\nsearch of his father\u2019s enemy\nBernie \u2013 Hilarious comedy based on a true story,\nan assistant funeral director (Jack Black), Texas, a rich widow (Shirley\nMacLaine), a district attorney (Matthew McConaughey) and a murder\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nDirector Tate Taylor\nScreenwriters Tate Taylor, Kathryn\nStockett (novel)\nCast Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer,\nEmma Stone\nThe Help\ned by dead children, but you\u2019re not\nexactly going to be pissing your pants.\nTurns out to be more of a sad, yet heartwarming story than scary. Maybe don\u2019t\ngo for any midnight visits to abandoned\norphanages, though.\nGhost\nThe only part of this film that\u2019ll give\nyou nightmares is Patrick Swayze\u2019s\nacting, or the equally horrifying fact\nthat his character only ever replies to\n\u201cI love you\u201d with \u201cDitto\u201d. However,\nWhoopi Goldberg certainly manages\nto make up for it with her sassy one-liners and outrageous 80s get up. Yes,\nthe whole ghost thing is a very tenuous\nlink to Halloween but who says you\ncan\u2019t celebrate with a soppy 80s chick\nflick?\n5 Films to watch on Halloween (if you\u2019re a MASSIVE WUSS...)\nCoraline\nAdmittedly a little sinister considering\nit\u2019s meant for kids, this is the perfect\nfilm for a wussy Halloween. The film\nabout venturing off into secret worlds\nis magical, mysterious and beautifully\nmade, and there\u2019s a stunning scene\nwhere the garden literally comes alive\nwith glowing flowers (although look out\nfor the plants that look suspiciously like\nfemidoms). One of those few films that\nactually makes sense for it to be in 3D.\nThe Orphanage (El Orfanato)\nThis English-subtitled Spanish film has\na few scary faces and involves the traditionally creepy premise of being haunt-much every single British comedian that\nexists (there are cameos from Rob Brydon, Tasmin Greig and David Walliams\nalong with many others) and it\u2019s only a\nteeny bit gory, so avoid eating anything\nthat looks like someone\u2019s innards whilst\nyou watch it and you should be alright.\nYoung Frankenstein\nThe fact that Gene Wilder is the star of\nthe film should surely give it some scare\nfactor. This parody remake of Mary\nShelley\u2019s novel makes plenty of nods\nto classic black and white horror films,\ncomplete with old-school scene transi-tions. Apparently, Aerosmith got the\nidea for the title of their song \u2018Walk this\nway\u2019 from a gag at the beginning of the\nfilm, so if that\u2019s not got you watching it\nI don\u2019t know what will.\nSo, it\u2019s Halloween and your friends suggest you have a group trip to the cinema to watch Paranormal Activity 3.\nThere\u2019s just one problem: last time you\nwatched a scary film, it was The Ring\nwhen it came out on DVD ten years ago,\nand despite watching it in the middle of\nthe day you still shat yourself. Have no\nfear! Here\u2019s a list of \u2018safe films\u2019 for utter wimps like you.\nShaun of the Dead\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this film yet, where\nhave you been? Quite possibly one of\nthe most successful British films in recent years, this zombie-smashing film\nwill have you laughing like nobody\u2019s\nbusiness.

    "content": "GAMES\nThe Golden Joystick\nAward Winners Free-to-Play? Watch\nyour language\n@FelixGames on\nTwitter\nIt\u2019s actually being used properly now I swear.\nFree-to-Play is often anything but. Laurence Pope debunks\nthe idea that F2P games are a poor gamer\u2019s wet dream\nF\nree-to-play games are exactly what\nthey say on the tin \u2013 video games that\ndon\u2019t cost money to play. If this is what\nthey truly were then I could wrap this\narticle up right now, but unfortunately\nthe rule \u2018there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch\u2019 still\nremains unbroken. Here\u2019s why.\nI picked up on this issue whilst desperately scouring the internet at 11.45pm on Wednesday evening,\non the lookout for some mildly interesting gaming\nnews. Mojang, creators of Minecraft, are currently\ndeveloping a new game, Scrolls, and like many\ngames now-a-days will offer the player the ability\nto use real-world cash to purchase in-game items.\nIn this case it\u2019s new scrolls, i.e. spells. However, it\nwill not even be a F2P, as it will have an as-of-yet\nunannounced initial cost.\nBy paying for the game players will get access\nto a large amount of starting scroll/spells, as well\nas an earnable in-game currency and an \u2018auction\nhouse\u2019, enabling players to bid for the scrolls of\nothers. Of course, if you have a few pounds jingling about in the bank you can cut through all of\nthis and simply pick out what you want.\nThis decision was mostly down to Notch (real\nname Markus Persson), Mojang\u2019s founder, who\nhas claimed that \u2018Free-to-Play\u2019 games really ought\nto be called \u2018As expensive as you want [them] to\nbe\u2019 games. Granted, AEAYWT2B isn\u2019t quite as\nsnappy as F2P, but it\u2019s certainly far more accurate.\nAny red-blooded gamer\nshould have already\nmemorized this list. For\nthe unenlightened...\nBest Action/Adventure Game:\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood\nBest Mobile Game:\nAngry Birds Rio\nBest RPG:\nFallout New Vegas\nBest MMO (subscription):\nWorld of Warcraft (obviously)\nBest Fighting Game:\nMortal Kombat\nBest Racing Game:\nGran Turismo 5\nBest Sports Game:\nFIFA 11\nBest Strategy Game:\nStarcraft II: Wings of Liberty\nBest Music Game:\nGuitar Hero: Warriors of Rock\nBest Free-to-Play Game:\nLeague of Legends\nBest Downloadable Game:\nMinecraft (also Most Addictive)\nBest Shooter:\nCall of Duty: Black Ops\nOne to Watch Winner:\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\nInnovation of the Year:\nNintendo 3DS\nOutstanding Contribution:\nSonic The Hedgehog (seriously?)\nUltimate Game of the Year:\nPortal 2 (my personal favourite)\nHarry Enfield demonstrating how to be a\nwell-prepared F2P gamer\nEnraptured and enthralled by this\narticle? Didn\u2019t think so, so show us\nwhat you can do instead! Contact\nus at: games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOf course, there\u2019s always the argument that if a\nperson spends a colossal amount of money on a\nfree game then its their fault, not the game\u2019s de-velopers. After all, the designers didn\u2019t press a\ngun against my head and demand that I spend X\namount of cash on a new spell or cosmetic item.\nOr did they? They didn\u2019t of course - at least, not\nliterally. Game developers can be very sneaky in\nthis regard, and as Notch said, \u201cThe reason anyone switches to \u2018free-to-play\u2019 is to make more\nmoney.\u201d This seems counter-intuitive but it does\nmake sence; a game that costs nothing at all can be\ndownloaded by anyone, this produces three types\nof player \u2013 people who play it but only for a short\nwhile, people who play it for longer but don\u2019t spend\nanything on it, and another group who continue to\nplay and spend money on it. It\u2019s the final group\n(obviously) who earn the company their profit.\nIt\u2019s also the same group who suffer from the\ngame developer\u2019s psychological tricks to monetize\nthe player. Little things that end up nickeling and\ndiming you \u2013 the illusion that you can earn in-game\ncredits when they\u2019re nowhere near enough to support your scroll/weapon/cosmetics buying; low\ncosts lull you into buying again and again, reasoning that \u2018it\u2019s only a few pence\u2019, when in fact your\ncoffers are being drained little by little; TF2 pulls\na dirty little trick by effectively charging \u00a32 a pop\nfor a 1 in a 100 chance to get an elusive \u2018sparkly\u2019\ncosmetic addition. I\u2019ve experienced this latter trick\nfirst hand, getting shamefully sucked into it for a\nfew months before I came out feeling very poor,\nvery foolish, but a hell of a lot wiser. By not putting a cap on spending F2P games can rake in much\nmore cash than traditional games that charge just\nfor the inital purchase. In effect, you end up play\u201cIn effect, you end\nup playing with a slot\nmachine. A slot machine\nthat always pays out, but a\nslot machine all the same.\u201d\nI could make a crude joke here about showing her my magical staff, but I won\u2019t\ning a slot machine. It\u2019s a slot machine that always\npays out, but it\u2019s a slot machine all the same.\nScrolls is attempting to buck this trend by being a paid game with the ability to buy stuff, but\nI\u2019m still going to be wary. To the inexperienced,\nthe F2P model does appear at first glance to be an\nideal prospect, but always jump into them with due\ndiligence. As I said last week, keep in mind that\ngame companies are businesses, and need to make\nmoney one way or other. If a game appears to be\nfree, watch out for hidden motives \u2013 those sneaky\nchaps in game R&D will grab you by the short and\ncurlies and never let go.\nFELIX\n32 Friday 28 OcTOBER 2011\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I\u2019m glad I did. Ouais, she is\njust another electro-pop act that we all\nare capable of living without, but if you\nactually are incapable of living without\nFrench, female electro-pop then you\u2019re\nprobably dead right now if you have not\nheard of Yelle.\nOpening her set with two identically\ndressed male drummers complete with\ngreen sports visors, the flamboyant\nFrenchie ran on stage engulfed from\nhead to foot in a coat which seemed to\nYelle\nNinkasi Salle du Kao, Lyon\nOctober 22, 2011\nLily Le\nWe all yell for Yelle!\nbe made of shredded newspaper. Well,\nkudos to her for the recycling ethic and\nthe ability to sing (very well, in fact) under that thing.\nDespite an absence of live instruments\nexcept for the drums and her voice, the\nuse of just a backing track was not at\nall detrimental to the performance. The\nbeats were heavy enough to keep everyone dancing and Yelle was boisterous\nenough to keep everyone\u2019s eyes glued\non her. Plus, she was pumpin\u2019 those\nmoves to no end, you couldn\u2019t not join\nin.\nWith two costume changes; first into\na tiny leopard print dress and then into\na skin-tight, full-bodied red playsuit; her\nset was gimmicky enough to fit in with\nthe air of Perry-Gaga-Rihanna-esque\nplastic whilst maintaining a sharp edge\nof Major Lazer cool.\nIt is a shame that all of the songs were\nin French (or that the English culture includes a complacency of being ignorant\nof foreign languages) otherwise she\u2019d\nsurely take the English charts by storm.\nHowever if Yelle\u2019s style sounds like\nyour kind of thing, don\u2019t let it put you\noff having a listen as the music is definitely strong enough to hold itself up.

But \u2018Young God\u2019, one-half of Seattlebased Blue Sky Black Death (BSBD), is definitely a\nclose second. In fact, if BSBD weren\u2019t so damn fan-tastic, I\u2019d say he was an arrogant so-and-so (thank-fully U2\u2019s songs afford them no such protection).\nBSBD\u2019s latest album, Noir, is an education in how\nto make epic electronic/instrumental music prop-erly. What I mean by this is that instead of brazenly\nshouting, \u201cTHIS MUSIC IS FOR STADIUMS\u201d (*ahem,\nM83\u2026) their music takes you on an expressive\nemotional journey that just so happens to include\nthe feeling of staring deep into an eternal sky.\nFlowery language aside, it\u2019s the logical conclusion of moving instrumental hip-hop away from the\ndancefloor. Songs like \u201cSleeping Children Are Still\nFlying\u201d may have a wicked country-infused drop,\nbut it doesn\u2019t rest on its laurels; the remaining five\nand a half minutes are varied and diverse, with nary\na hint of a repetitive chorus.\nSo my advice, no, my plea to you this week, is sit\nyourself on your bed, hook up the speakers, and\nenjoy the sensation of falling through the abyss.\nBlue Sky Black Death sample Brobama\u2019s inauguration speech on their track \u201cAnd Stars, Ringed\u201d.

The bright morning\nsunshine rarely reaches its dark\nrecesses and its artists receive\nlittle attention. The Felix Music\nNights are our way of celebrating this\nunder-appreciated scene and also fostering it; bringing more students into the\ntent and saying, \u201cHey, there\u2019s a good\nthing going on here.\u201d The formula hasn\u2019t\nchanged since last year\u2019s successes:\nscout the finest DJs from Music Tech,\nsniff out some red-hot bands from Jazz\n& Rock, and grab London\u2019s most hyped\nup-and-coming artists to headline.\nOur headliner this time is rapper Mikill\nPane. With some of the wittiest and\nweirdest lyrics around, he\u2019s similar to\nDas Racist. He shot to attention with his\nheart-wrenching rhymes on Ed Sheeran\u2019s track \u201cLittle Lady\u201d and has been\noverloading music blogs since, receiving\npraise from none-other than Dj Semtex.\nBelow, I\u00f1igo gives you a sneak-peek at\nthe DJ lineup and how Felix and Music\nTech started collaborating:\nFelix approached Music Tech Society\nin January of last year, about doing a\nWiiJ performance for their new student\nmusic night. WiiJing is, essentially, hacking a Nintendo Wii remote to use for live\nmusic manipulation or, as the name sug-gests, DJing. Unfortunately, no hacking\nwas in the works at the time. The suggestion did, however, inspire a new live\nelement to the society. A live electronic\nimprovisation group was banded, though\nit remained untitled by the time the night\ncame along. Sadly, No More Reality, as\nit came to be dubbed, is no more, on the\ncount of the academic dissidence of the\nlocal synth wizard. Such is life.\nThis time around, KABLAAM will see\nMusic Tech behind the turntables for a\ntetrapak of electronic stimulation. Opening the evening, Not Indigo will warm\nup the sound system with an unorthodox\namalgam of groovy head hop, chilled\npsychotropics and dubby rhythms. Keeping it slow and low, SMB will provide\nsome fine deep cuts from the frontiers\nof house and techno.

    "content": "Alex Nowbar\nNEWS\n4 FELIX\nFriday 28 OCTOBER 2011\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn Brief\nUniversity applications fall\nAfter years of steady increases, university applications are currently 9%\nlower than last year\u2019s level at this time\nwith 7000 fewer applications so far. Although the deadline for most courses\nis January, these figures from UCAS\n(University and College Admissions\nService) are the first official application\nfigures for students who will be paying\nhigher tuition fees of up to \u00a39000 per\nyear.\nHowever, since these figures only\nshow applications up to October 19,\nUniversities UK has warned that they\nremain \u201cunreliable indicators\u201d and do\nnot yet tell the full story. A better indicator of the change in application numbers may be the fact that, despite the\nlarge decline in total applications so far,\napplications with an October 15 deadline (Oxbridge, and all medicine and\nveterinary applications) are only down\n0.8%. On the other hand, the majority\nof these applications will be from high\nUK students, and a 9.3% reduction from\nother-EU students, applications from\nstudents outside the EU have risen significantly by 8.8%. Although the near\ntrebling of tuition fees in 2012 does not\napply to international students, their\nfees are already exceptionally high, often over \u00a320,000. These latest figures\nreflect the consistently high reputation\nof UK universities worldwide and their\nstrong appeal to international students.\nInterestingly, whilst applications from\nmale students saw a decline of only 7%,\napplications from females have dropped\nby 10.7%. This can also be linked to a\nhigher decline in applications for arts\nsubjects and public services, such as\neducation and nursing, which typically\nhave more female applicants.\nApplications for science subjects,\non the other hand, have generally not\nchanged hugely with applications for\nboth physical sciences and mathematical and computer sciences only down\n1.6%, for example. On the surface, it\ncertainly seems that students are now\naddressing the suitability, value-for-money and career prospects of university courses to a greater extent that will\nhopefully lead to wiser choices being\nmade. These changes could mark the\nend of an era whereby simply obtaining a degree was regarded by many students as the important aspect of univer-sity, regardless of the institution\u2019s status\nand the course they are studying.\nThe UCAS figures also show that\napplications from people over the age\nof 25 have fallen by a staggering 20%\nand over the age of 40, by 28%. Meanwhile, there has been only a 2.4% reduction in the number of 18 year olds\napplying, suggesting that the rising tuition fees are not deterring young people from further study as significantly\nas was expected.\nPro-Rector Professor Julia Buckingham told Felix that, \u201cit is still early days\nin the admissions cycle for 2012 and we\nwill want to hold off drawing any conclusions at this stage. Data from UCAS\nsuggests the number of applications for\nImperial received by October 15 were\ndown by around 0.3% for 2012 entry\ncompared to the same point the previous year. However the rate appears\nbroadly in line with the level of applications received for 2010 entry, indicating\nthat more information is needed for us\nto properly understand any trends in application rates.\u201d\nSophia David\nDemand for science study steady in comparison\n\u201cThere is still\nuncertainty as to\nwhether there will\nbe a late soar in\napplications\u201d\nacademic achievers who are most likely\nto attend university anyway despite the\nrising fees. Therefore, there is still uncertainty as to whether there will be a\nlate soar in applications to match this\nsmall decline of early applications, or\nwhether the rise in tuition fees has taken a greater toll on those students that\nwould apply to courses with the later\nJanuary deadline.\nToni Pearce, vice-president of the National Union of Students, has suggested\nthat the current figures are a reflection\nof \u201cthe confusion caused by the government\u2019s botched reforms\u201d which are\n\u201ccausing young people to at the very\nleast hesitate before applying to university.\u201d\nA survey commissioned by the BBC\nhas also suggested that the higher fees\nwill put off 10% of potential students in\nEngland. However, Universities Minister, David Willetts insists that, \u201cit is important that no one is put off applying\nto university because they do not have\ninformation about how the new student\nfinance system works.\u201d\nHowever, whilst the figures show an\n11.9% reduction in applications from\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nAn experiment in the Mechanical Engineering department whereby PhD students have been allowed to\nshare the academic common room (701) with staff\nmembers has ended after six months \u2013 with the eviction of students. In an email sent to the students\ninvolved, Mike Lowe, Chair of the Space Committee,\nlisted a combination of contributing reasons why \u201cthe\nfacility is no longer working out to be convenient.\u201d\nLowe accuses students of \u201ctaking coffee sachets\nand milk away from the room \u2013 presumably to make\ncoffee elsewhere\u201d, and abusing the facility \u201csimply to\nget free take-away cups of coffee.\u201d He adds that \u201cthis\nmisses the intention of it being an informal place for\npeople to meet colleagues.\u201d Lowe also argues that\nthere are now too many people using the common\nroom and that it has become too popular for formal\nsmall meetings, which limits access for others. One\nPhD student, who wished to remain anonymous, told\nFelix that \u201cthe reasons for the space being closed off\nto PhD students are ridiculous. The room is always\nmostly empty. The perception is that the decision was\nmade by a couple of grumpy lecturers with no respect\nfor PhD satisfaction.\u201d\nSophia David\nPhD coffee row in Mech Eng\nPembridge Annexe to be demolished\nPlans to demolish a disused annexe from behind Pembridge Gardens hall of residence in favour of a residential development have been clarified by the College\nFund.\nPembridge Gardens, located in Notting Hall, has\nbeen operating at approximately 105 bedspaces\nsince 2009, when it handed over its annexe to the\nCollege Fund. The annexe, deemed \u2018non-core and not\nrequired for undergraduate accommodation\u2019, has the\ncapability of housing 32 bed spaces out of 24 bed-rooms. Following its handover, the annexe remains\nempty and sealed off.\nThe College Fund aims to stabilise College finances\nby managing investments assets, such as the annexe\nand maximising their return.\nJohn Anderson, CEO of the College Fund, says that,\n\u201cit was handed over to the College Fund in 2009. This\nis a 1970s block which has had no refurbishment and\nis not fit for appropriate habitations so if it were to be\ncontinued then it would have been refurbished for that\npurpose.\u201d\n\u201cWe have been working with the Royal Borough of\nKensington and Chelsea on a planning scheme. The\nidea is that we knock [the annexe] down and replace\nit with a townhouse and 13 residential apartments.\nAnderson envisages that the development, which\nhas been going through the planning process for two\nand a half years, will be completed in 2014 due to a\n24 month construction period.\nDr Marko Krznaric, warden of Pembridge Gardens\nand Parsons House has stated that his main aim in\nterms of the development \u201cis to ensure that the new\ndevelopment, whenever it happens, has no major impact of the living conditions to the students in Pembridge.\u201d \u201cI have to say that the College and the Fund\nresponded pretty well and it seems that all, or most of\nmy concerns were addressed.\u201d\nMatthew Colvin\n\u201cApplications for\nscience subjects ...\nhave generally not\nchanged hugely\u201d\n\n"

Though a well-known managerial style \u2013 at least known well enough\nto have its own (and pejorative) name\n\u2013 no reliable statistical study on its occurrence appears to exist; nor does there\nseem to be any thorough study, psychological or sociological, of the phenomenon beyond, namely the economic\nconsequences when it affects business\nmanagers.\nThis is indeed a surprising fact, especially since micromanagement has afflicted so many historical figures that\nthis article could be filled by a list of\ntheir names. But, instead of boring the\nreader with such a dull curiosity, it is\nour intention to expose the dire consequences micromanagement can have by\nconsidering the best known example of\nsuch: King Phillip II of Spain.\nPhillip II (1527-1598) is perhaps best\nknown in the United Kingdom for being the husband of Queen Mary I, and\nfor trying to conquer England with the\nill-fated Spanish Armada. Perhaps less\nknown are his working habits, constituting the most extreme case of micromanagement in history.\nPhillip II inherited from his father,\nEmperor Charles V, the Crowns of Castile andAragon, which included, respec-tively, the Americas and the Kingdom\nof Naples, as well as the Netherlands,\nFlanders and other former territories of\nthe Duchy of Burgundy. Later on, he\nwould become King of Portugal (1582).\nEach of these territories were subject to\ntheir own legal systems, inherited from\nthe Middle Ages, and had little in common except their monarch.\nHence, to no surprise the Spanish\nmonarchy had promptly divided its affairs into different councils, each of\nwhich was in charge of part of them \u2013\ne.g. the Council of the Indies would take\ncare of America; the infamous Council\nof the Holy Inquisition, of religious af-fairs, etc. Any affair had to be referred\nto one of 14 such councils. For instance,\nif the viceroy of Naples had something\nto report, he would have to send his letter to the Council of Italy, rather than to\nthe King himself, and wait instruction\nfrom that Council.\nAlbeit somewhat an archaic managerial system, in theory it allowed the\nKing to oversee the general policies of\nhis empire, and leave all the minor details to the Councils.\nHowever, Phillip was terribly meticu-of all of them at the same time. Today\nthere came two men, whose affairs held\nme for two hours, and the amount of\ndocuments they left behind will take me\nmore time than I have. I am exhausted.\u201d\nHis attention to detail was such\nthat, on the comissioning and building\nof a palace, he wrote to his architects\nordering them to place the kitchen assistant\u2019s quarters far away from the\nservice latrines, as the smell could be\nunbearable.\nThe consequences of this obsessive\nattention to detail were ample. As Phillip himself complained, the amount of\naffairs he had to take care of usually\nmeant huge delays in his decisions.\nFor instance, in the 1570s, fearing a\nTurkish invasion of southern Italy, the\nviceroy of Naples asked the Council\nof Italy for permission to levy troops.\nTen disquieting months passed before\na decision was made \u2013 to call troops\nfrom northern Italy. In the meantime,\nthe viceroy is said to have bitterly com-plained: \u201cif I had to wait for death, I\nwish it came from Spain, for then it\nwould never arrive!\u201d\nHaving so many affairs to take care of\nmade most of his decisions incredibly\nshort sighted; his lack of time to ponder\nan adequate economic and military policy (he would simply order more levies\nif his possessions were to be attacked)\nmade him spend far more money than\nhe had in such a way that, even though\nSpain was by far the richest country\nin Europe, it faced three sovereign defaults during his reign. A French ambassador would summarise this all by\npointing out that Phillip\u2019s decision of\nbeing \u201cking, minister and secretary at\nthe same time is virtuous, but it leads to\nso many delays and confusion that all\nthose who have to deal with the Crown\ndespair.\u201d\nThe story of king Phillip II has many\nlessons to be learnt about the dangers\nPhillip II of Spain (1527-1598), the \u2018Paper King\u2019 of Spain: an extreme example of a micromanager, and another\nwith a penchant for black polonecks\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nThe Cautionary Tale of King Phillip II, the \u2018Paper King\u2019 of Spain\nof micromanagement. For indeed, as it\nhappened to Phillip, all micromanagers\nend up enslaved by their own obses-sions; the bigger the responsibility, the\nless free time they will have; and taken\nto the extreme, the micromanager will\nlack the time to clearly and carefully\nthink about his decisions \u2013 many of\nthem will have to be delayed, and many\nmore taken in a rush.\nFurthermore, all micromanagers can\nend up being victims of their own sys-tems. Phillip, for instance, managed\nto isolate himself from his own advi-sors: any request had to be forwarded\nin written format, and since the ones in\ncharge of filtering them were his sec-retaries, they could safely dismiss affairs against their own interests, or bury\nthem among the ample paperwork. In\nshort, they became the most influential men in Spain and Phillip often appeared to be no more than an additional\nelement of his own bureaucracy.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n16\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 october 2011\nL\nast week, the decade of legal battles over half of the\ntraveller site at Dale Farm\nculminated into a physical one. Tony Balls, the\nTory leader of Basildon council, has\ndefended this eviction on the grounds\nof \u201cfairness\u201d \u2013 that the law must apply\nto everyone \u2013 which has been backed\nby his party\u2019s leaders. However, this\nneglects the different starting posi-tions: travellers are not treated like\neveryone to begin with. It\u2019s like making someone start a game of monopoly\nwith half the money of everyone else\nand then complaining that it\u2019s not fair\nwhen they start nicking money from\nthe bank when people aren\u2019t paying\nattention.\nTravellers are persecuted in this\ncountry; no one wants them as neigh-bours. This has lead to the UK being short of thirty thousand traveller\npitches. Councils have a set quota of\ntraveller sites that they must provide;\none which they tend to ignore. The\ngovernment, instead of strengthening\nthis quota, to make sure enough sites\nare available, are looking at abolishing it. This will stop the creation of\nnew sites. Travellers repeatedly try to\nestablish their own sites, but whereas the settler community (us) have\naround 20% of our planning proposals\nrejected, travellers have 90% of theirs\nrejected. The lack of planning permission granted forces travellers to build\ntheir site and ask for permission later.\nRetrospective planning permission\nis not unusual. It is regularly given,\nand it is only through our institutional\nracism that travellers rely solely on it.\nFurthermore, the details of this case\nhighlight the hypocrisy of Basildon\ncouncil. The reason planning permission is not being granted is because\nit is apparently greenbelt. However,\nbefore the traveller\u2019s arrival, this site\nwas a scrap yard \u2013 not exactly green\npasture. In fact, the council laid the\nhard ground, so the travellers did not\ncarry out the original development.\nAlso, currently, Basildon council are\ngranting planning permission for development on agricultural land near-by, highlighting the double standards\nof their greenbelt argument. Adding\ninsult to injury, the Tories are currently undermining the preservation of\ngreenbelt land through changes in the\nplanning laws, whilst so violently protecting the \u201cgreenbelt\u201d of Dale Farm.\nEven with the obvious double standards of this eviction the travellers\nwere prepared to move if the council\nfound them a local site. Even though\nlocal MEP Richard Howitt found a\npaid for site from the Homes and Communities Agency, the council have refused permission. They will not allow\nthe travellers to stay in Basildon. This\ngoes far beyond planning laws; it is\npure racism. Currently, neighbouring\ncouncils are digging up roadsides to\nprevent the travellers stopping there.\nAll the council has done is offer them\nhousing, an insult to their culture and\nway of life. This has caused both the\nUN and Amnesty International to\ncondemn this eviction with comparisons to Zimbabwe, as no culturally\nappropriate alternative is given. They\ncannot legally stay and they cannot legally travel.\nAlthough this is the largest traveller\nsite in Europe, I have been there and\nit\u2019s tiny. The illegal part is two or three\nfootball pitches in size. The fact that\nit\u2019s the largest shows only how little\nEurope accommodates its traveller\ncommunity. Also, at a time of austerity\nthe cost of eviction is thought to be approximately \u00a320million, making this a\nvery expensive scrap yard.\nThis may be shocking in its persecution of a minority, but it is also inspir-ing. For the first time large contingents\nof the settler community have supported the travellers. Ordinary people\nwere locked to the caravans, including\nAnn and Myra, both in their late 70s,\nwho are completely repulsed by this\nracist act.\nThe day of action resulted in physical violence between the supporters\nand police (though I think Ann and\nATraveller\u2019s Tale\nLuke Sheldon\nIs nobody going to comment on the great tiling of the street? Puts Coronation Street\u2019s\ncobbling to shame\nAs reported extensively by the media this\nweek, university applications have seen an\napproximate drop of 9% from last year. In\nthe wake of such a startling figure (espe-cially in comparison to the year-on-year rise\nthat the sector has recently enjoyed), questions must be asked regarding the potential\nimplications that this may have on Imperial\nCollege.\nThe answer to such questions is relatively\nsimple however. The decrease in applications that we have seen will have primarily little effect on the College \u2013 as long as\nImperial continues to publicise how exactly\nit can help (primarily UK-based) students\nfrom deterring.\nSchemes are already being implemented\nto ensure that students will continue to apply to Imperial, such as the new and more\nextensive bursary scheme.\nHowever, an overwhelmingly negative\nperception still exists for many across the\ncountry with regards to tuition fees in gen-eral. Despite widespread advice from governmental bodies urging prospective students not to be dissuaded from applying to\nuniversity by the rise in tuition fees, there\nstill exists a distinct thought in the minds\nof those considering higher education as a\nreal option.\nThis thought, whether held by friends or\nfamily, is that students will be loaded with a\nstaggeringly large student loan to pay back\nfollowing graduation. This negativity follows\nfrom a generation that received higher education for next to no cost.\nIt is this perception that Imperial must\ntackle if it is to retain its impressive application rates. The bursary scheme must be\npublicised in the coming weeks as prospective students continue to consider their path\nfor the future. Focus need not be primarily\nfocused on bursaries, however. The fact\nthat contributions from alumni continue to\nenable students to embark on their studies\nhere is a fact that should be promoted as\nwidely as possible.\nNevertheless, it is also worth remembering the rise in applications from overseas.\nImperial is sure to continue encouraging international students to apply, ensuring no\nreal danger from reduced demand. We must\nalso consider the fact that applications for\nscience based courses has seen a lower\npercentage drop in comparison with other\nsubjects.\nIncluding international students, Imperial\nis probably one of the safest universities\nin light of the announcements. We should\nnot expect campus to become a ghost town\novernight. We should only start getting worried once the Union is empty on a Wednesday night.\nFELIX\nImperial versus\nuniversity applications\nWant to write\nan anonymous\ncomment about\nhow much Felix\nsucks?\nThen go to:\nfelixonline.co.uk\nMyra had little involvement in that side\nof resistance!), but if you condemn this\nresponse then try and imagine whether\nyou would not want physical support\nwhen being removed from your home.\nAll action was done with the knowledge and support of the travellers and\nthe support was commendable. Two\npeople ended up spending Wednesday\nnight with their arms in concrete barrels as the temperature nearly reached\nfreezing, with imminent arrest once\nremoved from the concrete. However,\nit didn\u2019t have to be this way. Even if\nit was felt vital to remove them from\nDale Farm, a traveller site could easily have been built in the vicinity.\nWith this the travellers would have left\npeacefully and quickly. The violence\nseen on the TV could have been pre-vented. Instead, our hatred of travellers\ncauses councillors to chase them out of\ntown at high human and financial expense to preserve the votes they would\nhave lost if travellers stayed.\nWhen I discuss Dale Farm with peo-ple, upholding planning law is always\ngiven as the first reason for evicting\nthem. However, quickly the discussions degenerate into false assumptions on the welfare dependency of\ntravellers (not an issue I\u2019ve ever heard\noutside of ill-informed debate), how\nthey live and how they would not want\ntravellers in their own back yard. When\ndiscussing this issue, please replace the\nword traveller with African, Polish or\nChinese and see whether you think\nthese arguments are appropriate and\nnot utterly racist. Whatever arguments\nyou hear on planning permission,\nplease remember that when it comes to\ntravellers, it is never truly about planning permission. It is because they do\nnot live like us and we do not like that.\nIf we cannot accept them as part of our\nsociety then they will be forced to live\noutside of it, breaking the law as a ne-cessity.\n\n"

To this I say \u2013 good rid-dance. I shall miss you about as much as\nI do my ingrown toenail.\nNow, unless you\u2019re a Libyan rebel, you\nmight find this viewpoint somewhat of-fensive. \u2018Surely\u2019, I see you write in the\nComments section, \u2018this man should\nhave been put on trial? Does this not\nmark the beginning of a doomed, bloodthirsty Libyan government?\u2019 Well, no, it\ndoesn\u2019t.\n\u2018But surely an eye for an eye makes\nthe whole world blind?\u2019 I\u2019ll come to this\npoint later, but Gandhi\u2019s argument isn\u2019t\ngoing to sway me on this issue. Gaddafi\u2019s\ndead; and I, for one, will not be shedding any tears or laying down criticism\nagainst either the National Transitional\nCouncil or the rebels that captured Sirte.\nThis man was one of the monsters who\nruled over Libya for over four decades.\nOne should appreciate that he was not\nalone; no one human can run a country\nwithout advisors, and Gaddafi had a lot\nof them. At the end of the day though,\nthe buck stopped with him. He was, in\neffect, the system, and all the atrocities\ncommitted both in Libya and throughout\nthe world via Libya-sponsored terrorism\nlead back to him.\nWith a pained expression I read the\ncomments on the BBC page when it\nGeorge Howard\nLaurence Pope\nOffended? I really don\u2019t care...\nGood riddance Gaddafi\nwas announced that Gaddafi had died in\ncrossfire: \u2018So this is how Libya wishes\nto start its new era of freedom.....with\na murder and a lie. Interesting\u2019, \u2018So we\nliberate Libya for a Government which\nis blatantly lying despite all the evidence\non the Internet? This is not a good start\nto a free Libya.\u2019 Oh God, stop being so\nwhite and middle class, it\u2019s hurting my\nbrain. I will say that it\u2019s blatantly obvious that Gaddafi was deliberately shot by\nrebels and not caught in crossfire; his autopsy revealed he was killed by a bullet\nto the head, and this would have occurred\nwhilst in the midst of some rather angry\nLibyans. The NTC should have just gone\nahead and admitted that passions had run\nwild \u2013 no one with a shred of intelligence\nwould begrudge them.\nThis was not the killing of a tyrant by\na truly organised fighting force. This was\nthe killing of a tyrant by the very people\nhe\u2019d oppressed and beaten down, people\nwhose emotions were running sky-high\nwhen they found him hiding like a rat\nin a sewer (oh the irony). Many of these\nrebels would have lost family and friends\nto the man now begging for mercy at\ntheir feet. If I\u2019d have been in their shoes,\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019d have been prepared to argue for his life.\nAn eye for an eye does make the whole\nworld blind, it\u2019s true. But in this case, I\nfirmly believe that a bullet to the head\nwas the correct medicine to prescribe.\nNo court he could have been tried in\nwould have been fair. You are a fool to\nthink anyone would pass a completely\nI\nn just over a year at this great in-stitution, I have never felt driven\nto write to Felix to express my\nviews in response to any article.\nBut I was genuinely riled this\nweek by the comments and general sentiment towards a critique of the show\nthat encapsulates all that is wrong with\nBritish Society: The Jeremy Kyle Show.\nNow it was the pure and unadulterated hypocrisy of a number of people\nwho commented online that perturbed\nme. From comments such as \u2018you classless moron, you\u2019 (I suggest a lesson in\nEnglish grammar before you publish\nyour next column\u2026) and \u2018[makes me]\nashamed to be at Imperial\u2019, it appeared\nthat a handful of self-righteous liberals\nhad come out in force to oppose an article that made some bloody good points.\nIt is this armchair socialism that really drives me up the wall. Here we have\npeople, enrolled at an elite University,\nand probably typing on their brand new\nMacintosh computer whilst sitting in\ntheir west London house, who feel they\nneed to be offended by proxy for the\nguests that feature in this show.\nIf you have such qualms with the\nclass system of the UK, why are you\nstill enrolled at a university that has as\nits modus operandi \u201cScientia imperii\ndecus et tutamen.\u201d? (This, for those of\nyou not fortunate enough to have had\na classical education bestowed upon\nthem, means: \u201cKnowledge is the adornment and protection of the Empire\u201d.)\nEnough said.\nJust watching one episode of the\naforementioned show will highlight\nthe appalling situation that ten abysmal\nyears of serially incompetent socialist\nLabour government has created. People\nin a cycle of poverty, living drug and alcohol addled lives whilst fuelling reckless and unsustainable consumerism\nfunded by the honest, hardworking tax-payer. You only need to drive through a\ncouncil estate (yes, I did do this once)\nto notice that they have the highest\ndensity of satellite dishes per street and\nthe highest number of new cars (with\nblacked-out windows of course) than\nany other residential area; I wonder\nwhere all the money comes from?\nThe crux of this problem is in atti-tude. What we have here is a generation of people who feel they have some\nGod-given entitlement to a roof over\ntheir heads, filled with all the trappings\nof modern consumerist culture, whilst\nthey need not lift a finger to contribute\nto a society that is subsidising their ex-cesses.\nSo yes, indeed, I do \u2018blame the individual\u2019. It is their life to live, and their\nlife that they have royally screwed up.\nI wonder how many of them would be\nproclaiming the greatness of the government if they ever made it anywhere\nin life.\nAnd finally, to those who try to palm\nimpartial, unbiased judgement on him\nif he remained in Libya. Guilty was the\nonly judgement that could ever have\nbeen passed, and the whole thing would\nhave been a complete and utter farce \u2013\none only has to look at Mubarak\u2019s trial\nto see what would happen. A protracted\ntrial would have only delayed progress;\na clean kill immediately cleared the way.\nNo Gaddafi, no old system, simple as.\nHe died before he could leave another\nimpression; he did not die a martyr. The\nwhole world, including his old support-ers, saw him hide like a rat and killed like\na dog \u2013 so much for fighting to the last.\nOn 20 October 2011 his former government was completely and utterly annihi-lated.\nAm I trying to promote violence and\ncapital punishment? No. In general, I oppose any unnecessary wars and fighting,\nand I waver when it comes to execution\nby the state. But I am not so morally inflexible that I can\u2019t see that sometimes\nwar is a painful necessity, as it has been\nthroughout the Arab Spring. Change for\nthe good would have never occurred\notherwise. And whilst many might see\nGaddafi\u2019s death as something that ought\nto have been avoided, I can\u2019t. His death\nmarked a clear-cut end to the war, and\nnow Libya can rise up with a clean slate\nand begin anew. Our hopes will be with\nthem.\noff the blame to the parents of these\npeople. Can you seriously be advocating that parents are the sole influence on\ntheir children? There must come a point\nwhen the child develops sufficient sentient faculties to make the connection\nbetween their parents\u2019 mistakes and\ntheir own situation. What we need here\nis a society that, rather than encouraging this spiral of poverty, inspires a\ngeneration to better things. And I can\ntell you that benefits definitely won\u2019t\nachieve this.\nAnyhow, returning to the article.\nYes, it may have been a tad offensive.\nI might even concede that there may be\nsome at Imperial who were affected by\nthe issues raised in the show. However,\nthe majority of normal people read the\narticle, formed an opinion on it, and got\non with their lives. So, to those out there\nwho were \u2018fuming\u2019and \u2018apoplectic with\nrage\u2019, get over yourself and go and do\nsomething worthwhile with your life.\nMuammar Gaddafi: literally the man with the golden gun\n\u201d\nThis was the killing\nof a tyrant by the\nvery people he\u2019d\noppressed and\nbeaten down\n\u201c\nThis was\nThis was\nof a tyran\nof a tyran\n\u201d\nCan you seriously\nbe advocating that\nparents are the sole\ninfluence on their\nchildren?\n\u201c\nCan you\nCan you\nbe advoc\nbe advoc\n\n"

Looking for an experience of a\nlifetime, I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\nAfter stepping out into the oppressive hu-midity, the first thing that struck me about\nthe capital, Kathmandu, was the chaos that\nconsumed everything; the traffic, the pe-destrians, and even the electricity cabling.\nAs a pedestrian, it would be quite possible\nto make a sport of traffic dodging. The only\npractical way of getting across a main road\nwas to tuck in behind a local and hope that\nluck was with you. Once I had grasped the\nconcept of crossing a road, Kathmandu, and\nparticularly the small district of Themal, really opened up. It is littered with hundreds of\nshops and market stalls, all trying to sell the\nsame things. I could easily have spent days\nmeandering through the streets bartering\nfor the best prices on jewellery, trinkets and\nclothing. The locals are delightful and always\nkeen to chat, whether they\u2019re telling you stories of their own lives or just quizzing you on\nEngland and the mystical nature that seems to\nsurround it over there.\nGet there: A tube that takes you to E1\nSee: Galleries, museums, \u2018dickheads\u2019\nEat: The Albion, Shoreditch\nCost: \u00a35 for some top-notch grub\nNext Thursday marks the first Thursday of November.

It just so happens that the world\u2019s\nsecond largest bungee jump is also there. Standing 165m high over raging torrents, I found\nmyself being strapped to a piece of \u2018string\u2019 by\ncomplete strangers, approaching a platform and\nasking myself why I was about to throw myself off a bridge. Then I jumped and I realised\nwhy \u2013 an adrenaline rush that can\u2019t be matched.\nYou accelerate towards the ground, the air flying past you, the blood rushing to your head,\ncaught in a daze of excitement and horror as\nyou expect the worst. Then the bungee tightens\nand you\u2019re sprung back towards the sky, twisting and turning as the world flies past, the sky\nindistinguishable from the mountains and the\nriver. Before you know it, you\u2019re being pulled\nfrom just above the river to the safety of land\nwith some very high tech equipment \u2013 a piece\nof bamboo. After being unstrapped I laughed\nout loud, amazed that I was still alive.\nIt wasn\u2019t the need to jump off a bridge that\nattracted me to Nepal. The main reason for my\ntrip was to volunteer in a Buddhist monastery.\nEach weekday I would walk about forty minutes to the monastery on the outskirts of Kathmandu, where I would be greeted by a cup of\nNepali tea and a \u2018good morning sir\u2019 from practically every monk that I taught. There were\nthree classes of mixed ages ranging between\nthree and sixteen. The monks were really quite\ncheeky and much preferred playing games over\nlearning English and maths, so it is fair to say\nthat they can confidently play Thumb Wars,\nSimon Says and Bingo. They were brilliant at\nbeing blunt, pointing out the fattest one of the\ngroup when asked what fat meant, or nicknaming one of the younger ones \u2018monkey\u2019 because\nhe had ragged teeth and ate paper. Apart from\nthe occasional Gameboy or knife that had to\nbe confiscated, they were fantastically well behaved and I believe that they truly appreciated\nmy time there as much as I did. It was on my\nlast day at the monastery that the monks were\ntreated to the use of a digital camera, and they\nabsolutely loved it. They managed to take over\n250 photos where they posed in unbelievably\n\u2018G\u2019 fashion, rounding off a brilliant experience\nfor me.\nVolunteering was without doubt the most\nrewarding thing that I have ever done and I\nwould highly recommend it, especially in Nepal. The country is so different from England; it\nfelt like such a breath of fresh air and gave me\nmemories that I will never forget. I only hope\nthat other people would be willing to immerse\nthemselves into the chaotic country that sits on\ntop of the world.\n\u201c...twisting and turning\nas the world flies past...\u201d\nLuke Sanders\nCanoeing with crocodiles, bamboo bungee-jumping and mad\nmotorists \u2013 an exhilarating Nepalese adventure\nVolunteering on top of the world\nGetting to know a Himalayan local...\nOne of the friendliest Nepali locals, Suresh,\norganised a trip to the Chitwan, a national park\nthat resides southwest of Kathmandu. Tourists\nendure six hours on a bus through the mountains to travel to Chitwan, where it\u2019s possible\nto experience an elephant jungle safari. The\noption of washing the elephants was also on\noffer, as well as a ride in a canoe that skims\nthe surface of the river by mere inches, beneath\nwhich crocodiles swim. Perhaps more exhilarating than this was the actual journey from\nKathmandu to Chitwan. The road that took\nme there balanced precariously on the edge of\nthe mountains that occupy Nepal. Motorists\nseem to have an unnatural desire to end their\nown lives and those of people around them by\nconsistently attempting overtaking manoeuvres\non blind corners whilst going uphill in a lorry.\nThe only compensation for the sheer terror that\nwas inflicted on me was the majesty of the surrounding scenery. The river that ran adjacent to\nthe road carved a path through the mountains\nwith ease, offering an insight into the power of\nnature. A veil of mist fell upon it in the early\nhours and appeared to shroud everything in\nmystery and serenity; a complete contrast to\nKathmandu.\nSanctuary from the fast pace of the capital\ncould also be found towards the Tibetan border.\nWish you were here\n\u2018Athens Diving World Series\u2019 by Aris Messinis\nWish You Were Here\nTravel on your doorstep\nFirst Thursdays in East London\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial College Union has become the\nonly student union in the UK to publish an\nofficial response to the National Student\nSurvey (NSS). A poor performance in this\nthis year\u2019s NSS has been widely blamed\nfor the College slipping 11 places in the\nSunday Times League Table for 2012 en-try. This was the first year of a new meth-odology, which places greater weight on\nthe survey, being used to compile the table.\nThe report \u2013 written by Union President\nScott Heath, Deputy President (Educa-tion) Jason Parmar and Representation\nCoordinatorAndrew Keenan \u2013 summaris-es the NSS data in an easy to understand\nformat and, in the words of Parmar, \u201cprovides 35 Union Recommendations to help\nimprove the Student Experience at Imperial\u201d. Parmar has written in his official blog\nthat \u201cthe low results in the NSS reveal a\ngenuine problem with the quality of teaching at Imperial\u201d and added that he believes\nthat \u201cif college takes on board and effectively implements what this response from\nthe Union and student body recommends,\nthen we should see a dramatic increase in\nthe quality of teaching and student satisfaction at Imperial College.\u201d\nThe NSS Response reveals that while\nstudent satisfaction with teaching is 83%,\ncomparable with previous years, a large\nnumber of students believe that staff have\nnot \u201cmade the subject interesting\u201d. This is\nattributed to \u201clack of variety in teaching\nmethods, as well as our institutional stubbornness to embrace new technologies\u201d.\nTo combat this, the Union recommends\n\u201ctransparent and formal training for lecturers with biennial review\u201d and \u201csolidifying\nthe claimed link between teaching ability\nand promotion\u201d. Parmar has told Felix that\nit is widely accepted that \u201cthe route to professorship is that you have to teach\u201d.\nFurther improvements could be\nachieved through \u201cvisible, prominent and\nprestigious\u201d student-led teaching awards\nbeing extended to every department to\nincentivise high quality teaching. Additionally, implementing a \u201c\u2019You Say, We\nDid\u2019 campaign within each department to\npromote changes in teaching as a direct\nresult of Student On-Line Evaluation\u201d\nwould create \u201ca powerful tool for spotting\nindividual problems and successes\u201d and\nwould make students \u201cfeel that they can\ninfluence their course design\u201d.\n3\nFELIX Friday 28 october 2011\nNEWS\nMore student cuts\nMore student cuts for Imperial\nstudents at South Kensington\u2019s\nFRESH Hairdressers.\nMen\u2019s cuts \u00a322\nWomen\u2019s shampoo and cut and\nshake dry \u00a328\nWomen\u2019s shampoo, cut and\nblow-dry \u00a338\nAll of our cuts are done by highly\nexperienced stylists.\nTuesday to Fridays 9.30 to\n4.30 (sorry no discounts on\nSaturdays).\nWe are only 70 metres from\nSouth Kensington tube station\nTo book an appointment, call\nSponsored Editorial\nDiscount haircuts for Imperial\nstudents at Fresh Hairdressers\n0207 823 8968.

Heath has pointed out that\nwhile \u201cpart of the University\u2019s [full] name\nis technology\u201d it has \u201ctoo often followed\u201d\nothers in this area. He gives Imperial being one of \u201cthe last to have a mobile app\u201d\nas an example of this. He believes that\n\u201cyou can\u2019t be number one if you follow\u201d\nand that it is therefore \u201ctime to lead\u201d.\nAs such the Union has recommended\nthat the \u201cCollege actively encourage and\nreward innovations in teaching methods\u201d,\npointing to MSc in Strategic Marketing as\na prime example. An appendix to the re-port, which is available on Parmar\u2019s blog,\noutlines how handing out iPads to students\non the course has improved communications between them and staff. It explains\nthat \u201capps such as Goodreader allow students to make notes on the lecture slides\nduring teaching [and) let them send annotations directly to lecturer so they can\nexpand or explain points and send them\nafter a lecture as a point for discussion in\ntutorials\u201d. Coursework elements which\nincorporate \u201ccreating Wordpress blogs,\nmaking applications, building websites\nand filming videos\u201d were also praised.\nThe report\u2019s authors also believe that\ntechnological innovations may help the\nCollege in the area of Assessment and\nFeedback, in which it is currently ranked\n163rdoutof168bytheNSS,withsatisfac-tion at 54%. The Union recommends that\n\u201cCollege and the Union work [together]\non a major project: the creation of a feedback and assessment programme that simplifies and automates the process for staff\nand students\u201d. The software would allow\n\u201ca marker to instantly type or transcribe\nfeedback for each student as they mark\u201d.\nThe report points out that this \u201cwould\nprevent administrative delay\u201d, solve \u201cissues of legibility of marker\u2019s handwriting\u201d and provide a \u201cmethod of gathering\nreliable cohort-wide information\u201d. Further\nsuggested improvements in Assessment\nand Feedback include making \u201cmarker\u2019s\ndeadlines as compulsory as students\u2019 submission deadlines\u201d and regularly reviewing coursework to \u201censure relevance \u2026\nand to seek improvement\u201d.\nThe report also supports students\nbuilding up soft and transferrable skills\nto aid with their Personal Development,\nwith Heath saying he would like to see\nthe implementation of a \u201ctransferable\nskills course\u201d and \u201cmore group work\nand presentations\u201d as part of students\u2019\ndegrees.

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX Friday 28 October 2011\nArrest yourself for not developing a love for this show\nIt was recently announced that a new\nseries of Arrested Development is in the\nworks and will be aired at some point\nin the future. The plan is to then make\na film. If you are anywhere near as big\nan AD fan (as those in the know call it \u2013\nalthough it does make it sound a bit like\na disorder) as I am you will have flipped\nyour shit, I believe that is the technical\nterm. Don\u2019t worry, that is purely metaphorical shit-flipping going on.\nThe show centres on a family called\nthe Bluths. Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is very much the most normal\nmember of the family. He has to become\nthe President of the Bluth Company,\na property developer, after his father\nGeorge Bluth Snr. (Jeffrey Tambor) is ar-rested. The general trials and tribulations\nof the eccentric Bluth family become the\ncentre of the show. The show also has a\nnarrator (Ron Howard \u2013 also the show\u2019s\ncreator) who really is almost a character\nin his own right and is used astutely to\ncreate hilarity.\nWhy the big fuss about this? That\u2019s a\nvery good question, I\u2019m glad I wrote it\n(I\u2019m in a smug mood). Well, basically,\nAD is an awesome show that\u2019s absolutely hilarious. It\u2019s immensely quotable in a\ntruly unique way. It has all of these great\ncatchphrases, in-jokes and call-backs\nthat are impeccably put together, whilst\nat the same time not feeling forced. It\u2019s\nthose three things that really gave (dare I\nsay gives) the show its strength. For ex-ample, in one episode they set a couple\nof scenes at Burger King, repeatedly say\nthe name \u201cBurger King\u201d and even have\na character call it a \u201cwonderful restaurant\u201d. The reason for this was that they\nwere asked to set a scene in Burger King\nas part of a promotional deal that the network had with them. So, they sarcastically over-emphasised the advertising. It\u2019s\nthese Easter egg moments like that, and\nspotting some subtle joke or call-back\nthat make it so re-watchable.\nThere is however one slight problem\nthat I have with the show returning for\nanother series: the current 3 series are\nso good that I don\u2019t want the show to be\ntainted by a bad 4th series. I\u2019m not saying it will be bad, but I can\u2019t help having\nthis worry that it will somehow ruin the\nshow for me. It\u2019s stupid for me to think it,\nabsurd even, but it does, for some reason\nthat is difficult to explain: it will make\nrewatching the earlier episodes less enjoyable knowing that it show declines\nlater on. I\u2019d say that my feeling about the\nreturn are a mix between cautious optimism and mild worry \u2013 a bit like the constant feeling during exam period. I voice\nthis mix of emotions here because a) I\u2019m\na pretentious twat and b) I think that this\nview is not too uncommon amongst AD\nfans (finally, for once, I\u2019m normal \u2013 ah\nman, now this view is mainstream, I\nmust immediately reverse my opinion).\nWay too many TV shows have made\nthe mistake of dragging on for too long,\nor doing one too many \u201cspecials\u201d, that\nturn out to only be special in the more\nderogatory sense of the word. In fact, in\nterms of the absolutely classic example\nof this phenomenon, The Simpsons is\nstill making this mistake and will be\nfor another 2 series of legacy destruc-tion. Family Guy is another possible on\ngoing example. Basically, most sitcoms\nmake this mistake: they overstep the line;\nthey keep doing the same thing a few too\nmany times; and give the audience more\nof the thing that everyone proclaims they\nwish they did more of. The trouble is,\npeople like the idea of more of the same\nand usually don\u2019t actually like the reality\nof it. It\u2019s a bit like when you go out: the\nTim Arbabzadah idea of drinking another double vodka\ncoke (I know, I exude masculinity) is\nfantastic, but when you grant yourself\nthe wish you end up regretting it the next\nmorning. Although, the analogy doesn\u2019t\nextend that much, I don\u2019t think I have\never regretted sending a TV show a text\nthat felt like a fantastic idea at the time.\nIt seems like that paragraph went off\non a bit of a \u2018y = sin(x)/cos(x)\u2019 yes, I\nmade that joke. No, I promise to never\ndo something as horrific again, you can\nkeep reading in safety. The next paragraph will have returned to normality.\nThe thing that attracts people to the\nidea of something being done more is\nexactly why it shouldn\u2019t be done. The\nthing they like loses its mystique. It\u2019s no\nlonger special and rare, it\u2019s lost a large\npart of the appeal. How many expensive\ncollectors\u2019 items are commonplace? To\nuse Family Guy as an example, everyone\nloves the original couple of Brian and\nStewey episodes. If every episode were\nto be like that, then it would no longer\nbe a rare treat that you occasionally get\ngiven and gratefully receive.\n4th wall breaking paragraphs including\nterrible jokes and amateur TV watching\npsychologist impressions aside \u2013 let\u2019s\nget back to AD. All of the characters\nare funny, and picking a favourite is almost impossible. I\u2019m personally a big\nfan of G.O.B (Will Arnett), Michael\u2019s\nolder brother, an amateur magician who\nprefers to travel around on a Segway.\nAlthough I always find Tobias (David\nCross) is guaranteed to make you laugh.\nIt seems that AD is fairly popular\namongst the acting community, if the\ncameo appearances are used as a judging mechanism. Ben Stiller plays Tony\nWonder, GOB\u2019s arrogant rival, another\nmagician. Charlize Theron has a story\narc in the 3rd season as a love interest for\nMichael. For reasons that will become\nclear after you watch the show (because\nyou are going to watch it aren\u2019t you? I\nwill not reveal anything else about her\ncharacter).\nTalking about Charlize Theron\u2019s character has reminded me of yet another reason why the writing is so clever. When\nyou re-watch the show, you see things\nyou didn\u2019t notice before that you kick\nyourself for not realising. It\u2019s like being at a live Derren Brown show when\nhe does one of the big reveals at the end\nand shows you a video where he winks\nat a camera. For instance, Buster has a\nplot line (again no spoilers) that is very\ncleverly foreshadowed in some scenes.\nWhat more can I say? Quite a lot actu-ally, but I don\u2019t really have space. I think\nI must give a quick, honuorable mention for Henry \u201cThe Fonz\u201d Winkler who\nplays the family\u2019s hilarious, inept lawyer.\nThat\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s an ensemble cast,\nbut all the characters are well developed,\ninteresting and expertly portrayed.\nTo sum up: it may be returning soon,\nthe first 3 series are amazing in all ways\nand you will be hooked once you get into\nit. The only down side is your conversations with friends will involve more\nquotes/references than they should, as\nwill your Felix articles. Try and avoid\nthis, it\u2019s a HUUUUUGE mistake.\nAny more punny headlines and I\u2019ll be forced to hand myself in...\nA bunch of typical Imperial students\nEccentric isn\u2019t the word...\n\u201cIt seems like that\nparagraph went off\non a bit of a y =\nsin(x)/cos(x).

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n8\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 october 2011\nD\nespite the millions it spends on\ncultivating an image of arch so-phistication, Stella isn\u2019t likely\nto shrug off its \u201cwife-beater\u201d\nepithet anytime soon \u2014 and\nespecially not now it\u2019s become the tipple of\nchoice for tosspot terriers. But the story of a\nStaffordshire Bull Terrier attacking a child after someone poured Stella down its throat isn\u2019t\nthe only piece about alcohol abuse that stood\nout recently.\nA couple of weeks ago, the online BBC\nNews Magazine ran an opinion piece: \u201cIs the\nalcohol message all wrong?\u201d written by Kate\nFox, co-director of the Social Issues Research\nCentre (SIRC), a not-for-profit organisation\nbased in Oxford that researches and monitors\nsocial and cultural trends. SIRC conducts most\nof its research by reviewing social-anthropo-logical studies. In the BBC article, Fox seeks\nto put paid to \u201cbizarre beliefs and weird customs\u201d such as the notion that \u201cheavy drinking\ncauses promiscuity, violence and anti-social\nbehaviour\u201d. A key claim is that \u201c[t]he effects\nof alcohol on behaviour are determined by cultural rules and norms, not by the chemical actions of ethanol\u201d.\nNow, I\u2019m no expert on alcohol \u2014 not scientifically speaking \u2014 but that sounds a bit\nodd to me. Having only just escaped the death\npenalty with a plea of diminished responsibil-ity, I\u2019m not sure that the dog would be not too\npleased with the suggestion either. Looking\nfor a second opinion, I contacted Dr. Robert\nPatton of King\u2019s College London, who is the\nHealth Services Research Coordinator for the\nSouth London and Maudsley NHS Trust Addictions Division, and who worked for the\nHome Office Drugs Prevention Initiative as a\nconsultant in the 1990s.\n\u201cI had seen that article and did raise an eyebrow at those comments\u201d, Patton said. I asked\nhim about the idea that changes in behaviour\nwere caused by cultural norms rather than\nchemicals. \u201cWhile it is true to say that there is\nan expectation of the effect of alcohol that does\nto an extent modify behaviour\u201d, he said, \u201cthe\nfact is that alcohol is a drug that does influence\nbehavior in many ways, particularly those concerned with impulsivity (and restraint), aggression and coordination\u201d.\nEven judging by the comments Fox\u2019s article\nreceived \u2013 over 1000 in half a day, many of\nthem removed by moderators \u2013 SIRC\u2019s position seems to be somewhat controversial. Helpfully, one of the commenters linked to a British Medical Journal editorial from way back\nin 1999 that expressed concern about SIRC\u2019s\nclose connections with MCM Research, a\n\u201ccommercial market research company\u201d with\nseveral drinks companies as clients, including The Amsterdam Group, which numbers\nBacardi-Martini, Bass Brewers, Carlsberg,\nGuinness, and Heineken among its members.\nThe BMJ also discussed SIRC\u2019s criticism at\nthe time of the media\u2019s role in health scares\n(SIRC also apparently coined the word \u201criskfactorphobia\u201d back then, but we\u2019ll let that\nslide) and presciently asked, \u201chow seriously\nshould journalists take an attack from an organisation that is so closely linked to the drinks\nindustry? If, for example, the centre attacked\nnewspapers for exaggerating the effects of\nalcohol and thereby causing an unnecessary\nscare, could the centre put its hand on its heart\nand claim that it was totally neutral on the issue?\u201d\nKeen to get a clearer idea of where the organisation was coming from, and whether the\nBMJ\u2019s concerns were still appropriate today, I\nspoke to Peter Marsh, SIRC\u2019s other co-direc-tor. Marsh told me that MCM Research was\n\u201cnot actually trading in its own right very much\nthese days\u201d but that the work now goes through\nSIRC. SIRC\u2019s website states that it is now the\nhost for reports and materials of both groups.\nDoggone drunks\nDouglas Heaven investigates claims that alcohol does not affect behaviour\nSecondary forests not as good as\nthe original\nWhen it comes to biodiversity, there is no substitute\nfor ancient tropical forests, scientists have found.\nForests that are regenerated following a severe\ndevastation such as fire or harvesting, known as\nsecondary forests, are no match for their ancient\ncounterparts. As a consequence of their great age,\nancient/primary tropical forests have unique ecological features that secondary forests simply cannot replicate in a shorter space of time.\nA meta-analysis of biodiversity in forests where\nchanges in land use had taken place showed biodiversity dropped in all situations except for selective\nlogging. The results were published in Nature last\nweek. DOI:10.1038/nature10425\nBio-logic gates\nScientists at Imperial have made bacteria and DNA\ninto logic gates. They are the most advanced biological logic gates every made. Logic gates are used for\nprocessing information in digital devices and are a\nfundamental part of silicon circuitry. Without them,\nthe digital devices we rely on today would not exist.\nThe scientists made an \u201cAND\u201d gate out of the gut\nbacteria E.Coli and were able to combine it with a\n\u201cNOT\u201d gate to make a more complex \u201cNAND\u201d gate.\nThey published their results in Nature Communications last week. DOI:10.1038/ncomms1516\nAncient forests preserve biodiversity\nCorrection\nLast week Farhan Abdullah should have been credited as the author of the article \u201cSleep deprived\ndoctors find potential cure\u201d. I unreservedly apologise for this error \u2013 The Editor\nE.Coli \u2014 not just for food poisoning\n\u201cWhile an expectation\nof the effect of alcohol\ndoes to an extent modify\nbehavior, the fact is that\nalcohol is a drug that\ndoes influence behaviour\nin many ways\u201d\nBut on the question of how SIRC maintained\nindependence in its research, Marsh was very\nkeen to establish that the centre hasn\u2019t done\nwork for the drinks industry for several years,\nand that the last commission in this area \u201cin a\n5 year timeframe\u201d was for Greene King on the\nrole of the pub in the local community. That\nsaid, he also told me that Fox\u2019s recent opinion\npiece is based on work begun 15 years ago.\nBut what of Fox\u2019s assertion about the\nchemical effects of ethanol \u2013 or lack of them?\nIsn\u2019t it dangerously misleading to suggest that\ndrunken behaviour is simply a cultural norm\nthat people conform to? \u201cExcept it happens to\nbe true\u201d, Marsh said, reiterating Fox\u2019s obser-vations, \u201cin this country we expect [alcohol]\nto make us aggressive ... You don\u2019t get that in\nmany other countries\u201d. According to Marsh,\n\u201cThe only common chemical action is to\nmake people go to sleep ... the idea somehow\nthat just consuming alcohol compels people\nto go and beat people up is not supported,\ncertainly by our reading of the cross-cultural\nevidence\u201d.\nWhether or not SIRC have conflicts of inter-est, it seems irresponsibly unscientific to draw\nsuch stark conclusions about the chemical effects of alcohol solely from anthropological\nevidence. SIRC\u2019s overall position \u2013 that cultural aspects of alcohol abuse need addressing \u2013 is uncontroversial. The UK certainly\nhas a problem with alcohol and fresh ideas\nare needed, but a debate that begins with an\nequivocation over what it is to be drunk in the\nfirst place is not the way to go.\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nIt might be \u201cbizarre beliefs\u201d that make you act like an idiot, not all that alcohol...\n\n"

But let me\nask the people who are: what happens to\nyou when you hear a fat tune?\nI know that, whatever the genre, a good song\nalways elicits some kind of emotional response.\nFor some reason a huge bassline just does something different, something more physical.\nI think it\u2019s most obvious in Fabric or Cable\nat around 4am on a Friday night. Legions of\nclub-goers all have that classic I\u2019ve-just-heardabout-my-mum-having-sex-with-my-brother\nlook scrawled across their face.\nThe last time I went there, I noticed a man\nwhose jaw was actually on the wrong side of his\nface. I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do, or what to\nsay. Was it a medical emergency? Was he even\naware of it? God only knows.\nI always thought it was one of those things,\na weird kind of mass response. But then, while\ntrying to waste some time during revision period (you\u2019re gonna love it freshers!) I stumbled\nacross the Fred the Raver videos on YouTube.\nThe kid in the videos is about 3 years old: his\nparents play him Drum & Bass tracks and,\nstrangely, he does exactly the same thing i.e.\nW\nith universal song\nlyrics, occasional\nfalsetto vocals and\na collection of sing-along anthemic\nchoruses, to an extent Noel Gallagher\u2019s\nHigh Flying Birds contains all the ingredients that have characterised his later\nOasis contributions.\nComing in at ten songs it gives a nod\nto all the familiar influences, from the\nKinks-style staccato pulse employed in\n\u2018Dream On\u2019 to the psychedelic reverb\nswirl at the end of \u2018Stop The Clocks\u2019\nreminiscent of The La\u2019s \u2018Looking\nGlass\u2019.\nThe inclusion of dance-inspired \u2018What\nA Life\u2019, which although some might see\nas a forced attempt to distinguish from\nhis old band, does add an increased variety to the record; showcasing a different,\nhe pulls a bassface (it\u2019s hilarious, give them a\nwatch).\nThe child certainly hasn\u2019t been to Fabric (un-less he\u2019s got a great fake ID) and he probably\nhas never seen anyone pull a bassface before.\nSo why did he do it? He clearly loves it, why\nnot just smile?\nThinking about it, it didn\u2019t really make any\nsense, so the Imperial reflex kicked in and I\nstarted researching. The number of papers on\nScience Direct under \u201cbassface\u201d being zero, I\nventured into the slightly less reputable corners\n\u201cI noticed a man whose\njaw was actually on the\nwrong side of his face.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more to French rock than Serge Gainsbourg. For a time there was Sloy (1991\u20132000)\nwho looked like they were going places after playing shows with Shellac and being invited on tour\nby P J Harvey. John Peel took a shine to them too,\nback in the day. But despite sexing up their sleazy\npunk sound with a bugle solo on their third album\nElectrelite (1998) it still ended up being their last.\nCarrying the Tricolore today are Chevreuil.\nChevreuil are so French they don\u2019t even bother\ntranslating their band profile. But no matter, the\ngist is clear:\n\u201cTony C. (guitare) et Julien F. (batterie) commen-cent le groupe CHEVREUIL en 1998 ... 3 albums\n(\u201cSPORT\u201d \u2013 2000, \u201cGHETTO BLASTER\u201d \u2013 2001,\n\u201cCHATEAUVALLON\u201d \u2013 2003) ... mentor STEVE\nALBINI ... batterie m\u00e9canique/m\u00e9tronome ... le\ngroupe inaugure la guitare magn\u00e9tique, instrument hybride qui a un pied dans l\u2019univers du rock\net l\u2019autre dans l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re de la musique \u00e9lectronique\u201d.\nRoughly speaking, Chevreuil tread the same territory as Battles, but they\u2019re scuzzier and do without the squeaky vocals. There are also only two of\nthem, augmented by multiple amps and, in case\nyou missed it back there, a \u201cmagnetic guitar\u201d.\nAll punk has roots in its fanbase, with many\nbands doing as much as possible to blur the line\nbetween band and audience. Lightning Bolt famously set up on the floor in front of the stage\nwhen they play, with the crowd usually bouncing\ninto the drumkit. Chevreuil take a more academic\nstance towards inclusiveness.\nLast year they collaborated with Professor Rodolphe Durand, chair of the Strategy department\nat the HEC Paris business school, on his latest\nbook The Pirate Organization: an essay on the evolution of capitalism, which seeks answers to the\nquestions \u201cwhat connects sea pirates of the 17th\ncentury to the pirate radios, cyber hackers, and bi-opirates of our times\u201d and \u201chow does piracy relate\nto the evolution of capitalism\u201d. True to the spirit of\nthe project, Chevreuil wrote a song to accompany\nthe book and released it under a Creative Commons license. For their part in the enterprise the\nband were profiled in the Financial Times, an outlet not well known for its coverage of punk rock.\nSince we\u2019re in France this week anyway, it\u2019s also\nworth checking out Sincabeza and Pneu, especially if Chevreuil are your cup of chocolat chaud.\nAll three have song samples streamed from their\nlast.fm pages and Chevreuil\u2019s song about pirating\ncan be downloaded from www.organisationpirate.\ncom/p/la-musique.html\nPunk Planet by\nDouglas Heaven\nThis week: Chevreuil\nDo you have a bassface?\nChandra Chadalawada investigates the phenomenon\nof the Internet.\nThere I found a \u201cscientist\u201d who wrote about\nhow, in nature, the only sounds with a major\nbass component are things like the roar of a\nlion, a volcano erupting or a tree falling i.e.\nscary shit.\nHis hypothesis was, therefore, that basslines\n\u201cremind\u201d humans of things our caveman\nfriends got scared by.
