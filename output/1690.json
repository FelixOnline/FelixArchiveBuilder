This creative\nalchemy was inspired by\nthe traditional Japanese\nform of Bunraku, where\nhalf-life-size dolls act out\na chanted dramatic narra-tive. Emma Rice, Artistic\nDirector, describes the\nproduction as a combination of \u201cvirtuosity from so\nmany disciplines: composition and re-composition,\nadaption, musicianship,\npuppetry, performance,\nand design.\u201d All these\nmediums come together\nsynergistically to create\nan astonishing production.\nSitting in the Sam\nWanamaker Playhouse is\nan absolute delight. The\ncandle-lit chandeliers,\nhanging from the painted\nceiling, reflect warm\nlight on the gold foil\nwallpaper and illuminate\nthe landscape for Gyre\n& Gimble\u2019s puppeteers.\nThe playhouse, opened\nin 2014, was inspired by\n17th\ncentury architecture\nand based on drawings\nby John Webb from\n1660. Candle expert John\nRussell was consulted for\nthe 72 candles held in six\nmetal chandeliers, hoisted\non pulleys up to eight feet\nabove the stage.\nThe show begins with\na brief prelude of pieces\nfrom works by Vivaldi,\nGeminiani, and Purcell.\nWhether you are a classical music enthusiast or\nnot, this short repertoire\nis thoroughly enjoyable\nfor all. The chamber\norchestra, composed of\nsix musicians, is placed\nin the balcony above the\nstage, filling the cavern\u201cPuppeteers\nexhibit\nobvious skill\nand poise\nas they\nmanipulate\ntheir charges\u201d\n\u201cThe\nproduction\nhas more in\ncommon with\nballet than\ntraditional\ntheatre\u201d\nous theatre with clear,\nunamplified tones. First\nviolinist Jorge Jimenez\nfalters at times, but the\ntechnically challenging\nscore is otherwise handled\nwell by all.\nAlongside the beautiful\nmusic, Gyre & Gimble\u2019s\nco-directors, Finn\nCaldwell and Toby Oli\u00e9,\nbring to stage a striking\ndisplay of puppetry at its\nvery best. The puppeteers\nmove around the stage\ndressed in black without\ndetracting attention from\nthe wooden mannequins.\nThey exhibit obvious\nskill and poise as they\nmeticulously manipulate\nthe puppets, yet flawlessly\ncapture the very essence\nof the human form with\neach movement. From\nthe impetuous leap of a\nchild, to the deep breaths\nof a mother surrendering\nto death, the five outrageously talented puppeteers breathe life into their\nwooden puppets, encapsulating the human condition in a more profound\nway than many actors\non stage. The puppets\u2019\ndesign is simplistic, with\na neutral face, showing no\nemotion, and a body that\nallows for finer control of\nmovements. Despite \u2013 or\nmaybe because of \u2013 the\nblank mannequin-like\nfaces, each spectator can\nproject their own emotion\nonto the blank canvas,\ncreating their own unique\nperception of the story,\nallowing the audience to\npartake in creating and\ndefining the narrative.\nVivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons\noffers the perfect template\nfor a cyclical narrative,\nwhere life, death, and\nrenewal all take place. At\ntimes, the cyclical theme\nof love and loss creates\na sense of platitude, but\nthese moments are quickly\novershadowed by the raw\nemotion on stage. The\nemotional colour of the\nmusic feeds the mood of\nthe story and creates the\npeaks and troughs of the\nstoryline. At times, there\nappears to be a deliberately ironic contrast between\nmournful melodies and\noptimistic scenes, which\naccurately captures the\ncomplexity of human\nemotion.\nVivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons\nis heard far too often as\njingles in elevators or on\nhold on the phone, making\nus all a bit disenchanted\nby the melodies. In spite\nof this, Max Richter\nboldly reclaims and\nre-envisions the piece,\ninfusing life back into it.\nOriginally composed for\nfour separate parts within\na string orchestra, Max\nRichter\u2019s re-composition\nincludes the addition of a\nsynthesiser and a harpsi-chord. I am unconvinced\nby the incorporation of a\nclassically baroque instrument like the harpsichord\nwoven into Vivaldi\u2019s\ncannons, as it does little\nto enhance the piece,\nand seems to conform\nVivaldi\u2019s fluttering\ncannons into a more rigid\nform. Although Richter\u2019s\npassion for Bach and\nBaroque-esque motifs is\neasily identifiable in his\nreconstruction, it feels\nout of place. Typical\nof Vivaldi, energetic\ncheerful cannons gradually become synchronised\nand later transition to\nsolemn melodies. Richter\ndoes well to preserve this.\nThe production has\nmore in common with\nballet than traditional\ntheatre, owing to the fact\nthat the narrative is portrayed visually through\nthe medium of puppetry,\nwithout a spoken script.\nLike dance, the movements of the puppets are\nfree-flowing and complimenting of the music.\nThere are honestly not\nenough words to describe\nhow captivating and enthralling this production\nis. It oozes charm with\nelegant simplicity. The\npuppets are most mesmer-ising; the fluidity of their\nmotions and the uncanny\nresemblance to our own\nmovements make them\nendlessly intriguing and\nentertaining even if the\nnarrative were removed.\nEverybody loves puppets! // Steve Tanner\nARTS\nAnmol Patel\nArts Writer\nWhere? Sam Wanamaker\nPlayhouse\nWhen? Finished 21st\nApril\nTHE FOUR SEASONS\nBallet Black: glorious and achingly beautiful\nT\nhis March,\nBallet Black, the\ncompany consisting entirely\nof BAME performers,\nreturned to the Barbican\nwith a double bill. Their\noffering was a show in\ntwo halves; neither of\nthese were traditional\nperformances, but rather a\nshowcase of the power of\nmodern ballet.\nThe first half, choreographed by Cathy\nMarston, inspired by Can\nThemba\u2019s short story The\nSuit was slow, sad, and\nachingly beautiful. With\nlittle else but a couple\nof chairs, a sheet, and\na hanger, the scene of\na happy household was\nset smoothly, with Cira\nRobinson\u2019s Matilda and\nJose Alvarez\u2019s Philemon\ngetting ready for the\nday. Around them the\nimpressive corps dance\nwith well-honed skills;\nbeginning as furniture,\nthey transfigure themselves into reflections of\nPhilemon and Matilda in\nthe mirror as they mime\nwashing their faces and\nbrushing their teeth.\nPerfectly in sync, their\nmovements are nothing\nshort of mesmerising. As\nPhilemon left for work and\nthe corps followed, fluidly\nmorphing into passers by\nin the street, Mthuthuzeli\nNovember\u2019s Simon\ntook his place alongside\nMatilda in bed. As\nAlvarez danced stage left,\nRobinson and November\nperformed a sensual pas\nde deux, bodies moving\nwith captivating slinki-ness to the whine of the\nstrings. When Philemon\nreturns to pick up his\nforgotten briefcase he is\ngreeted with the evidence\nof his wife\u2019s betrayal. In\na hurry to leave, Simon\nleaves behind his suit.\nThe shock of Philemon\u2019s\ndiscovery of the affair is\nfollowed by an poignant\nattempt at reconciliation,\nbut the suit, the manifestation of Matilda\u2019s\nbetrayal, lingers. It haunts\nthe couple, taking the\nplace of an extra guest at\ndinner, Philemon, unable\nto forgive, pushes Matilda\nto dance with the suit at a\nparty as he watches sullenly from the sidelines.\nThe story quickly moves\ntowards tragedy: Matilda,\ntortured by Philemon\u2019s\nintransigence, desperate\nto make amends, attempts\nbut fails to destroy the\nsuit. In an heartwrenching\nconclusion to the allegorical tale, in the end, the suit\ndestroys her.\nIn contrast, the second\nhalf of the show, Arthur\nPita\u2019s Dream Within\na Midsummer\u2019s Night\nDream was delightfully\nlight hearted. Borrowing\nfromtheShakespeareclas-sic, at the outset it seems\nto be deeply traditional:\nthree couples in sumptuous tutus begin a routine\nto Handel. Slowly however the music grinds to a\nhalt and, frozen in place,\nthe dancers succumb to\nsleep, lit in flickers by a\nlazily gliding disco ball,\nas Puck (a magnificent\nIsabela Coarcy) dressed\nas a boy scout comes to\nspirit them away. In an\ninstant the stereotypical,\ntidy ballet is cut short.\nWhen the dancers awake\nthey are in a fantasy\nrealm. The remainder of\nthe performance in which\nthe dancers navigate\ntheir new surroundings is\naccompanied by a chaotic\nsoundtrack. Eartha Kitt\u2019s\n\u2018Let\u2019s Do It\u2019 opens\nproceedings. Then Marie\nAstrid Mence\u2019s Hermia\nsnorts Puck\u2019s fairy dust\nand sambas to the jaunty\ntunes of Yma Sumac\u2019s\n\u2018Malambo No. 1,\u2019\npairing off with Sakaya\nIchikawa\u2019s Helena in the\nprocess. The choreography is quick \u2013 with fast\nfootwork and fluid move-ments. Ebony Thomas\u2019s\nLysander and Mthuthuzeli\nNovember\u2019s Demitrius\nseem unconcerned by\ntheir loss of former partners and seem perfectly\nhappy in each other\u2019s\narms. Jose Alvarez\u2019s\nOberon is left pining\nafter them. Meanwhile in\nan unexpectedly tender\nsegment Titania dances\nwith Bottom to the\nBarbara Streisand cover\nof \u2018Bewitched, Bothered\nand Bewildered\u2019. A\nhuge-headed Salvador\nDali pops up to add to the\nsurreal feel of the colours\nand eclectic music. Pita\u2019s\node and subversion of\nto classicism is glorious\nand ridiculous in equal\nmeasure.\nIn a post-show talk, the\nfounder of the company,\nthe lead of the show, and a\nhost discussed some of the\nmotivations behind putting the company together\nand the difficulties it has\nfaced. The traditional pink\nballet shoe was compared\nto salmon coloured\nplasters \u2013 a \u2018nude\u2019 shade\ndesigned to deliver a\npurpose to the mainstream\nand simply be put up with\nby people of colour \u2013 the\nabnormal afterthought.\nBallet Black\u2019s rainbow of\ndifferent nude shades is\nquietly revolutionary, and\nillustrates the diversity\nthey are bringing to the\nindustry. Founder Cassa\nPancho spoke about her\nidea to set up the platform\nfor BAME dancers after\nfailing to find a single\nballet dancer who was\na person of colour in the\nUK to interview for her\nuniversity dissertation.\nThat platform now exists,\nand the company and\nits dancers are critically\nacclaimed. The company\naims to be obsolete \u2013 the\naim is its dancers will be\nrole models and encourage more people of colour\nto get involved in ballet.\nOnce the whole industry\nis more diverse, a specific\nplatform to give BAME\ndancer\u2019s an opportunity\nwill not be necessary,\nopportunities will be provided by all companies.\nDespite the company\u2019s\nprogressive mission\nstatement, one particular\nquestion in the Q&A\nabout Eurocentric beauty\nideals in ballet showed the\nart has further to go before\nit can truly be described\nas inclusive. Ballet Black\nhas unequivocally done\nwonders for diversifying\ncasts in term of race, but it\nseems requirements to be\na certain height and body\nshape to be casted are still\npresent. Ballerinas still\nneed to fit a mould, albeit\na slightly looser one.\nBallet Black begun\ntheir nationwide tour\nearlier this month, for full\nschedule see balletblack.\nco.uk\nThequietlyrevolutionarydancecompanyreturnstoLondonwithahauntingtaleofanaffairandaqueerretelling\nof A Midsummer\u2019s Night Dream.\nCira Robinson as Titania // Bill Cooper\nARTS\nSimran Kukran\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Yes,\nwe know \u2013 term hasn\u2019t\nquite started yet (for those\nearly-birds reading this\non a Friday morning),\nbut we felt so sad about\nbeing apart from our\nreaders we arranged to\nget an issue in a week\nearly, just for you! Also,\nlet\u2019s be real, pretty much\neveryone is already back\non campus, desperately\ncramming in the library,\nand getting frustrated by\npeople leaving their stuff\non spare desks while they\ngo on three-hour-long\nbreaks. Well, there\u2019s no\nbetter procrastination\nmaterial than Felix (well,\nmaybe Sporcle), so feel\nfree to dive straight back\ninto this week\u2019s issue!\nThis week our main\nstory is about something\nthat\u2019sbeeninthenewsalot\nrecently: the gender pay\ngap. For those of you who\nhaven\u2019t been following\nthe news, a while ago the\ngovernment announced\ntheir plans to have all\nlarge companies and\npublic institutions publish\ndata on the average wage\ngap between male and\nfemale employees, with\na deadline of the end of\nMarch/beginning of April.\nBefore we dive into\nwhat happened, a quick\nnote: yes, the term\n\u2018gender pay gap\u2019can seem\nmisleading \u2013 it doesn\u2019t\nrefer to women being paid\nless than men for the same\nwork (although this does\nstill happen), but rather\nthe average earnings of\nwomen compared to men.\nIt therefore gives you an\nidea about whether or not\nwomen are in highly-paid\npositions \u2013 the fewer\nwomen there are at the\ntop (or the more at the\nbottom), the greater the\ngap.\nThe results threw up\nsome interesting findings,\nparticularly within the\nuniversity sector. For the\nRussell Group universi-ties, the average gender\npay gap was nearly twice\nthe national average, indicating top positions at universities are often filled by\nmen. At Imperial, the gap\nwas lower than the Russell\nGroup average \u2013 in fact, it\nwas one of the lowest in\nthe Group. But while this\nis good news, it doesn\u2019t\ntell the whole story \u2013 men\nwere disproportionately\noverrepresented at the\nhighest levels, occupying\nover 70% of the top-pay-ing jobs, which was the\nhighest rate in the Russell\nGroup.\nWhile a lack of representation is important\nacross all industries, it\nis particularly important\nin the university sector.\nThese data help highlights\nsome of the challenges\nwomen face within\nacademia; we need to\nlook at why women aren\u2019t\noccupying the highest\npositions, not merely state\nthe fact. People we spoke\nto highlighted a number of\nbarriers for women \u2013 key\nstages of their career tend\nto coincide with the time\nmany people want to start\na family; the need to take\non research at sites around\nthe globe prevents a sense\nof stability; they\u2019re far\nmore likely to get negative\nfeedback from students\nfor teaching compared to\nmen. The list goes on.\nImperial has already\nput some initiatives in\nplace to address these\n\u2013 personalised develop-ment, help with childcare,\nselecting the widest pool\nof candidates for inter-views. These are all fan-tastic, but the gender pay\ngap results show there is a\nstill a long way to go. We\nalways hear about how\nImperial wants to be the\nbest at everything; here\u2019s\none area to focus on.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

The\nterm refers the difference in hourly pay of all\nmen and all women across a workforce, and\noccurs when women occupy lower paying\njobs, while men occupy higher paying jobs.\nThe term does not refer to women being paid\nless than men for the same work \u2013 although\nthis may happen, this is termed\u2018unequal pay\u2019,\nand has been illegal in the UK since 1970.\nFrom 2017, all large employers are legally\nobliged to publish the gender pay gap data\non their website, and on the government\nportal. Last week it was reported that one\nin ten companies still had not released their\ndata, despite the deadline being the 4th\nApril.\n\n"

He was\nalso in a clandestine\nrelationship with a twen-ty-two year old woman,\nwhile his marriage fell\napart behind a sheen of\nbourgeois respectability.\nWhile all this was going\non, he was getting ready\nfor his first major retrospective in June.\nTate Modern\u2019s exhibition Picasso 1932\nmeasures this colourful\nyear against the works he\nproduced, providing us a\nglimpse into the various\nevents that shaped the\nartist\u2019s life in that year,\nand his responses to them.\nIt is a detailed visual diary\nof how Picasso thought\nand felt during the year.\nAlthough it is unusual for\nan entire exhibition to be\ndedicated to the paintings\ndone in a single year by\none man, the tight narrative that the boundaries\nof a year necessitates\nmakes the show more\ninteresting. The stories\nthat link the paintings of\nthis year together become\nmore personal, and we get\na more intimate picture of\nwho the man was.\nThe exhibition is\narranged chronologically,\ndisplaying works as they\nwere made through the\nyear. In January, with his\nimpending retrospective\nin mind, Picasso produced\na series of portrait paint-ings. These are all of a\nfemale figure seated in\nan armchair, reading,\nsleeping, or in apparent\nbliss after sex. Across\nthese paintings and across\nthe other works in the\nshow, it is interesting to\nnote his variations across\nthemes \u2013 with the same\nfemale subject, Picasso\nmoves from saturated\ncolour harmonies to\nabstract linework, exploring emotions from\nthe hysteria and pain in\nBeauty and Terror to the\npeaceful serenity of Rest.\nThe inspiration for\nmost of these figures was\nMarie-Therese Walter,\nhis twenty-two year old\nmistress.Agood swimmer\nwith an athletic figure, she\nwould be a significant\npart of Picasso\u2019s life that\nyear, serving as his muse\nand model and injecting\na new sensuality to his\nfigures. In his chateau in\nNormandy, Picasso experimented with sculpture,\ntransforming Walter\u2019s\nstrong features into solid\nvolumes and bulbous\nshapes. These sculptures\nwere captured for the\nfirst time and published at\nthe end of 1932, and are\nshown here. Displayed\nnext to his paintings, we\ncan see the clear relationship between the two\nmedia, reflecting each\nother in their curves and\nstrong lines.\nIn March, Picasso\npainted a group of large\ncanvases that experimented with rich colours and\ncompositions. Girl Before\na Mirror, for example,\nstands out for its use of\nstrong, black lines and\nriotous colours, giving\na sense that the painting\ncan hardly contain the\nenergy within. During this\ntime, Picasso also flirted\nwith surrealism, painting\na series of horizontal\nimages that looked like\na nude or an octopus in\nvarying degrees, depending on the perspective.\nPerhaps the most preoccupying event on the year\nwas Picasso\u2019s retrospective in June, for which\nhe had rejected offers\nfrom major galleries and\nfestivals including The\nMuseum of Modern Art\nand the Venice Biennale.\nHe insisted on curating\nhis own show, and chose\nto mix up works from different periods in a dense\nhang, without providing\nthe dates of individual\nworks. While the frequent\nappearance of Walter\u2019s\nfeatures suggested to the\npublic that a new woman\nhad entered Picasso\u2019s life,\nthere was also a group of\npaintings of his family that\nwas displayed prominently in the show. Interestingly, these paintings were\nfrom his Blue period in\nthe early 1900s, and were\nmarkedly different from\nthis more contemporary,\nvibrant work, which also\nsuggested their datedness.\nAfter his retrospective,\nPicasso continued to\nexperiment, painting a\nseries of Reclining Nudes\nthat explored the perspectives one can take with a\nbody. He painted both the\nfront and back on a nude\non the same plane, fully\nexpressing the curves of\nboth breasts and buttocks.\nThese variations, like\nthe octopus-nudes and\nthe women in armchairs,\nreinforce the experimental nature of Picasso\u2019s\npaintings in this time, as\neach painting in the series\npushes more boundaries\nin perspective, colours\nand representation.\nIt is incredible to see\nwhat can be produced\nin the space of one year,\nand this exhibition allows\nus to see the patterns in\nhis paintings that recur\nthroughout the year, as\nwell as the incremental\npushing of boundaries\nand the limits of how far\na particular theme or composition can go. It offers\na meaningful story that\nbrings us through one of\nthe most significant years\nin Picasso\u2019s life \u2013 a story\nthat is entertaining and en-lightening, and definitely\nworth a visit.\nThe Tate Modern take us through one of the most important years of Picasso\u2019s life, examining how he reacted to\nthe world around him through his work.\nLe Reve (The Dream), Pablo Picasso, 1932 // The Penrose Collection; Succession Picasso/DACS London, 2018\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Forster\u2019s\n1910 novel\nHoward\u2019s End\nis a tale of\nDickensian proportions\nabout the dangers of\nmaterialism, and the\nimportance of the responsibilities we owe\neach other. In it, the\naltruistic Schlegel siblings\nclash with the wealthy\nWilcoxes: properties are\nbequeathed in secret;\norphans become heirs;\nmisjudged moments of\nviolence and others of\nwell-intentioned kindness\nlead to tragedy; the formerly miserly, selfish, and\ncruel see the error of their\nways. It is a quintessential\nturn-of-the-century romp,\nbut it holds a kernel of\nuniversality that has\nrung true decades after\nits initial publication,\nleading to numerous\nscreen and stage adapta-tions. Of these the 1989\nfilm adaptation starring\nEmma Thompson remains\nthe most acclaimed. It\nwas this production that\nplaywright Matthew\nLopez saw as a teen: he\nwas transfixed. The novel\nwould go on to have a\nprofound effect on the\nyoung Lopez \u2013 a young\ngay man growing up in\nthe small town, to whom\nit seemed E.M. Forster,\nhimself closeted, was a\ndirectly speaking.\nHis new play, The\nInheritance, is Lopez\u2019\nhomage to the novel and\nthe author who meant so\nmuch to him growing up.\nIn this sprawling two part\nwork that cumulatively is\nmore than six hours long,\nLopez reimagines the\ncharacters of Howard\u2019s\nEnd as gay men living in\ncontemporary New York.\nThe eldest Schlegel sister\nbecomes Eric Glass (Kyle\nSoller), a kind-hearted\nand thoughtful lawyer\nwho is soon to be evicted\nfrom the only home he\u2019s\never known; his ambitious\nand insecure boyfriend is\nToby (Andrew Burnap)\nwho is writing a play.\nTheir chance encounter\nwith Adam (Samuel H\nLevine), a charismatic\nyoung actor who upturns\ntheir lives, eventually\nleads Eric and Toby to\npart ways. When this relationship implodes, Eric is\ndrawn to the wealthy real\nestate developer Henry\nWilcox (John Benjamin\nHickey) whose partner\nof many decades, Walter\n(Paul Hilton) has just\ndied. Henry and Eric\u2019s\nburgeoning relationship,\nbalanced on the cusp of\nfriendship and romance, is\nthe fulcrum around which\nthe drama of the second\nact revolves.\nAn added conceit is that\nthese characters are performing the play within\na play: they have been\nconjured up by a young\nuniversity student, Jasper,\nwho is led by Morgan\n(Paul Hilton) \u2013 a thinly\nveiled Forster who shifts\nthe narrative at intervals\nto probe further into a\ncharacter\u2019s motives, or to\noffers pearls of wisdom.\nIn collecting a group\nof characters that represent both the past and\npresent Lopez attempts to\nconstruct a grand unified\ntheory what it means to\nbe a gay man in America\ntoday. In this regard, The\nInheritance attempts to\nbe a successor to the great\ngay American plays of the\n20th\ncentury: Angels in\nAmerica and The Normal\nHeart. Conceptually it\nis a melding of the two:\nepic in scope, like Angels,\nwith just a hint of magical\nrealism, and a generous\ndose of philosophizing for\ngood measure; while also\ndomestic like The Normal\nHeart, less angry perhaps,\nbut just as specific. It is\na shame then that The\nInheritance never quite\nmeasures up to either.\nWhen dealing with\nthe main elements of the\nplot, Lopez is excellent,\nand the action unfolds\nwith soapy flourishes.\nThe cast, all immensely\ncapable, with Burnap\nas its most charismatic\nstar, are cheered (and\nsometimes, jeered) on by\nthe audience. Although\nimmensely long, the\nplay, like the gossipiest\nof Netflix dramas, is immensely watchable.

    "content": "FILM\nFRIDAY, 27TH\nAPRIL, 2018 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n22\nIsle of Dogs: A cute tail that lacks some bite\nI\nt\u2019s been four years\nsince the release of\nThe Grand Budapest\nHotel, a commercial\nand critical success for director Wes Anderson. It\u2019s\na tough act to follow, but\nIsle of Dogs is a delightful\naddition to Anderson\u2019s\nbody of work \u2013 his\noffbeat filmmaking style\ntranslates impressively to\nanimation, which captures\nhis playfully childish\nworld with wonder.\nIt\u2019s 20 years in the\nfuture, and in Japan\u2019s\nMegasaki City\u2019s authoritarian leader Mayor\nKobayashi exiles all dogs\nto Trash Island due to an\noutbreak of canine flu\nvirus. Six months later,\nAtari, the nephew of the\nMayor, crash lands on\nTrash Island in search of\nhis dog, Spots, who was\nthe first dog banished by\nthe decree. Atari is aided\nby a trusty band of five\ndogs, who are now given\na purpose: to search for\nSpots, and ultimately\nrekindle the companionship between man and\ndogs.\nFirstly, the film is a\nvisual treat. The puppets\nand the sets are masterfully made, and there is pure\njoy in observing just how\neverything moves and\ninteracts. The animation\nis beautiful and there is\nendless pleasure in the\ndetails that breathe life\ninto this world and its\ncharacters. In the scenes\non Trash Island, the visual\nstyle is greasy and gritty:\nit coherently captures an\napocalyptic landscape,\nwith mountains of debris,\novergrown fields, smoggy\nskies, and rusty colour\npalettes. There is plenty\nfor hardcore Anderson\nfans to fetishize, as the\nfilm is full of title cards,\nsymmetrical shots, maps,\ndeadpan dialogue, and\nalmost everyone in the\nfilm is a complete intro-vert. Anderson obsesses\nover the framing, and his\nattention to detail in his\ncomposition is exactly\nwhat you would expect.\nIt\u2019s nothing new from\nAnderson; he does the\nthing he does best, and\nthere is some comfort to\nthat.\nLike Anderson\u2019s other\nfilms, Isle of Dogs has a\ndarkly comic streak that\nhas a sharp bite to it. Just\nten minutes in, a brawl\nbetween dogs ends with\nan ear being chewed off\nand thrown away where\nrats nibble at it; Mayor\nKobayashi\u2019s moustached\nface is plastered onto a\ngiant screen invoking\nimages of Big Brother\nfrom 1984; there are\nscenes of dogs being\nrounded up into cages to\nbe gassed; a young boy\nhas bits of metal piping\nsticking out of the side of\nhis head for an unhealthy\namount of time. Moments\nof unexpected violence\nor dark themes become\nalmost an antidote to\nthe relentless kookiness.\nThe abstract world that\nAnderson creates gets instantly grounded in reality\nand its consequences.\nThis undercurrent of\nviolence is an important characteristic to\nAnderson\u2019s storytelling\nstyle, as it reinforces the\nimportance of the characters\u2019 motives. In Isle of\nDogs this is underplayed.\nAs a result, the film sits\nawkwardly between the\nboundary of being an\n\u201canimated kids\u2019 film\u201d\nor being a full-throttle\nAnderson film, and never\nquite decides which.\nWith all the juggling of\nheavy ideas, Anderson\nfails to reach a satisfying\nconclusion. The narrative\ngoes through several diversions that seem to swirl\naimlessly around the point\nit wants to make.\nWhile the film is clear\nin its stance against\noppression and injustice,\nthe primary voice of\nreason comes from Tracy,\nan American foreign\nexchange student with a\nhunch. This clouds the\nintentions of the film,\nand is at conflict with the\nsocio-political subtext it\ntries to retain.\nMany debates have\nbeen sparked on whether\nthe film itself is racist:\nits touristy portrayal of\nJapan and the blissful\nignorance of the majority\nof the Japanese people is\nsomewhat problematic,\nbut Anderson sets the\nfilm in Japan for largely\naesthetic reasons, and\nshows that he is (at least\nsuperficially) in love with\nJapanese culture. There is\na fantastical and celebratory air in the marriage\nbetween modern Western\nand ancient Asian traditions in Megasaki.\nDoes Isle of Dogs triv-ialise Japanese culture?\nI feel like Anderson\nwould not have made a\ndifferent film in light of\nthese concerns, as his\nwhole filmmaking style\nis based on an unbounded\nand childish creativity.\nThe Japanese dialogue\nis not subtitled but translated through different\ncharacters or inferred\nthrough the voice acting\nand animation. This\npushes for more sympathy\ntowards the dogs who all\nspeak English but don\u2019t\nunderstand the Japanese.\nI didn\u2019t find it offensive\nor racist, but I wonder\nhow a Japanese speaking\naudience would view the\nfilm.\nThe film is successful\nin working on a number\nof different levels: a story\nabout a boy finding his\nlost dog; a stance against\ncorruption, xenophobia,\nand oppression; even as\nan advert for Japanese\ntourism. The film\u2019s\ninternal politics weren\u2019t\ntoo concerning while\nI was watching it, but\nbecomes more problematic as I think about it in\nretrospect. Isle of Dogs\nis the longest stop-mo-tion animated film ever\nmade, and it certainly\nfeels it. The charm of the\neccentric dialogue quickly\nwears off when it teters\ninto overindulgence,\nespecially in the final\nthird. It isn\u2019t as funny as it\nought to be, and partly to\nblame is its ambiguity in\nwhether it really wants to\naccommodate for younger\naudiences and portray a\nsugar-coated version of\nAnderson\u2019s dark universe.\nAnderson may not be at\nhis best, but Isle of Dogs\nbrings joy as a visually\narresting film that has\nflourishes of his signature\ntropes.\nWes Anderson shows us how much he loves dogs and Japan in his latest film.\nWho let the dogs out? // Twentieth Century Fox\nFILM\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Writer\nDir: Wes Anderson. Script:\nWes Anderson. Starring:\nBryan Cranston, Edward\nNorton, Bill Murray, Jeff\nGoldblum. 101 minutes\nISLE OF DOGS\n\n"

Top\nTracks: Sad Trombone;\nJust One Lifetime; Morning\nis Coming. For Fans Of:\nReggae. 42 minutes\n44/876\nThis is\u2026 not a joke\u2026 // Interscope\nY\nep, that\nh a p p e n e d .\nYou read it\ncorrectly. It\u2019s\nnot a misprint. The former\nfrontman of \u201880s pop-rock\ngroup The Police really\ndid make an album with\nMr. Boombastic himself,\nand they really did release\nit on 4/20. Honestly, I\u2019m\nstill in as much disbelief\nas you. It all sounds like\na joke. In accordance, I\nthought this review would\nbe something of a joke as\nwell, but, surprisingly, the\nalbum is not actually as\nterrible as you\u2019d expect.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s\nfar from amazing, but\nthere are certainly some\ngood songs to be found.\nSo how did the most\nunexpected collaboration\nof the century come\nabout? Well, Sting and\nShaggy claim they have a\nlot in common. Somehow\nI doubt that, but one thing\nthey definitely do share\nis mutual friend Martin\nKirszenbaum (a.k.a.\nCherry Cherry Boom\nBoom) \u2013 founder of Cherrytree Records and Sting\u2019s\nmanager. He happened to\nbe working in the studio\nwith Shaggy and asked\nSting to sing a chorus on\n\u2018Don\u2019t Make Me Wait\u2019.\nThat in itself isn\u2019t so\nweird. Such things are\ncommoninshowbusiness.\nto record a whole album.\nThat turned out to be a bit\ntoo much for the world \u2013\nor at least for Sting fans.\nOver the years we got\nused to his experiments,\nsuch as Songs from the\nLabyrinth, a collection of\nrenaissance songs written\nby John Dowland, or,\nmore recently, The Last\nShip, a musical about the\ncollapse of Newcastle\u2019s\nshipbuilding industry.\nSeemingly unlikely collaborations aren\u2019t even\nthat rare anymore (think\nElton John and Eminem,\nPaul McCartney and\nKanye). But still, I\u2019m not\nsure anyone was prepared\nfor this head-on collision\nof artist and meme.\nWhiplash runs through\nthe record. The point of\nsuch collaborations is to\nstep out of your comfort\nzone, try new things, and\nadapt to a different environment and partner. Sting\nwas heavily influenced\nby reggae in his Police\ndays, so perhaps it wasn\u2019t\ncompletely new territory\nfor him, but he\u2019s never\nmade a straight reggae\nalbum like 44/876. It\ndoes, however, serve as a\nreminder of how versatile\na musician he is, another\ninstance of him taking\nan alien genre and seam-lessly integrating into it.\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing\nout his spotless vocals\non the album. Decades\nof rigorous practice has\nallowed Sting to perfect\nand maintain his voice in\nspite of aging. Obviously\nit has changed, but in\na good way \u2013 it sounds\nstrong, mature, and still\nabsolutely flawless.\nUnfortunately, the\nsame cannot be said of\nShaggy. He seems stuck\nin his dancehall manner\nthroughout, either unable\nor unwilling to leave\nhis comfort zone. Both\nmusicians have argued\nthat their voices nicely\ncomplement each other.\nI disagree. I\u2019m not sure\nif it\u2019s just a preference\nor because I can\u2019t detach\nfrom \u2018Mr. Boombastic\u2019,\nbut I find his vocals\nirritating. And I\u2019m not\nthe only one. While some\nSting fans accept his new\nfriend, many others are\ndesperately trying to get\n\u2018Shaggyless\u2019 mixes and\nalbum covers. Not a great\nsign.\nmost of the album. Slight\npop-leanings are seen\nin \u2018Gotta Get Back My\nBaby\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t Make\nMe Wait\u2019, but not at the\nexpense of more reflective\ntunes.\nThe great American\nDream (or lack thereof)\nhas been the subject of\nmany recent releases (see:\nLCD Soundsystem, David\nByrne). Sting & Shaggy\noffer their take from the\nperspective of migrants in\nPolice-like \u2018Dreaming in\nthe USA\u2019. The lyrics are\na conversation between\nsingers, each presenting\ntheir own views. This\nthread runs through other\ntracks such \u2018Just One\nLifetime\u2019 and \u2018Crooked\nTree\u2019.\nThe best is saved until\nlast. The highlight of the\nalbum is undoubtedly\n\u2018Sad Trombone\u2019 \u2013 a nos-talgia-tinged slow groover\nwith minimal Shaggyisms, a jazzy flavour,\nand touching lyrics about\nunhappiness in love.\nRounding off is \u2018Night\nShift\u2019, which emulates a\nsimilar vibe (although lyrically different), bringing\nthe LP to a neat end.\nTo summarise, the\nidea of Sting recording\na reggae album was\ndefinitely a hit, but his\nchoice of collaborator\nperhaps missed the mark\nsomewhat. If he\u2019d teamed\nup with somebody more\nflexible and imaginative,\nsuch as Horace Andy, he\ncould\u2019ve ended up with\nsomething far more interesting than nice reggae.\nAlthough, Sting has\noften said in interviews\nthat the most important\nthing in music for him is\nthe element of surprise.\nWell it\u2019s safe to say that\neveryone was astonished\nby this collaboration. If\nthat was the goal, mission\naccomplished.\n\u201cThe artists\u2019\ncollaboration\nis a bit too\nmuch for the\nworld \u2013 or at\nleast for Sting\nfans, who are\nasking for\n\u2018Shaggyless\u2019\nmixes\u201d\nBut, the guys apparently\nenjoyed working together\nso much that they decided\n\u201cOver the\nyears Sting has\nexperimented,\nbut I\u2019m not\nsure anyone\nwas prepared\nfor this head-on collision\u201d\nPerhaps this is a bit\nharsh. At the end of the\nday, Shaggy is a good\nentertainer \u2013 he was the\nonly artist who really got\nthe crowd going at the\nQueen\u2019s birthday party\nlast Saturday. And if it\nwasn\u2019t for him we would\nprobably never have heard\nthe Newcastle rockman\nsinging \u2018It wasn\u2019t me\u2019\n(check it out on YouTube,\nyou won\u2019t regret it).\nIf you do give 44/876\na go, don\u2019t be put off\nby the opener, a typical\ndancehall track akin to\nShaggy\u2019s earlier work\nwith introductory lyrics\n\u2013 by far the worst on the\nrecord. This unimaginative start is followed by\nthe optimistic, Marley-esque \u2018Morning is coming\u2019.\nOnce ignited, this\nwarm reggae flame burns\nsoothingly throughout\n\n"

However,\napart from us social\nmembers witnessing a\ngif of 2nd\nTeam Captain\nNoah Semonin dabbing\nhis beanie off during the\nclub\u2019s AGM, news of that\nachievement has probably\nstayed within the IC teams\nfor the most part, so Club\nPresident Joseph Kim\ninvited me to cover the\n2nd\nteam\u2019s home match\nagainst Surrey\u2019s 2nd\nteam\nat Ethos last Wednesday.\nI had time to have a\nchat with the IC team\nbefore the matches, and it\nwas great to see a relaxed\natmosphere within the\nteam, with cheerful faces\nall around. Unsurprisingly, they took it very well\nwhen I told them not to\nlose the tie so I didn\u2019t\nhave to report that!\nThe Surrey team eventually arrived 45 minutes\nlate, and \u2013 to make matters\nworse in what I imagine\nmust\u2019ve been an already\ntiring trip to London \u2013\nthey weren\u2019t able to field\na full team, effectively\ngiving us a two point lead\nin the tie before it even\nstarted.\nMatchday started with\nthe singles matches, and\nMatthew Cotton got IC\noff to a good start, taking\nthe 1st\ngame 21-11 with a\nconvincing performance.\nHis opponent upped his\ngame to win 21-17 and\nlevel the match, but any\nalarm bells that might\u2019ve\nraised were silenced when\nhe sealed the match with\na 21-13 win in the rubber\ngame. Concurrently,\nRanul Pallemulle \u2014 our\nother singles player \u2014\nendured a slower start to\nhis day. He won a number\nof points from his sturdy\ndefence, forcing his\nopponent to aim for the\nsidelines, but he never\nquite settled into his\nmatch and lost it 13-21,\n14-21.\nUp next was Jeremy\nLou and team captain\nNoah in the doubles, and\nthey too endured a rather\nslow start, improving as\nthe game went on but\nultimately losing a close\nfirst game 17-21. The\npressure was on in the 2nd\ngame, and they responded\nby turning up the heat.\nBut perhaps the tension\ngot to them as they made\nsome unforced errors here\nand there, losing the next\ngame 20-22.\nIt now came down to\nEdward Liu and Joseph\nto deliver a point from\nthe doubles, and they did\nso emphatically, taking\ntheir match 21-11, 21-13\nwith a dominant perfor-mance. Their smashes and\nnetplay paid dividends,\nbut crucially it was their\ntight serves which made\nthe telling difference\ncompared to Jeremy and\nNoah, giving their opponents no room to apply\npressure right from the\noff.\nWhile I turned my\nattention to the doubles, it\nwas a Matt vs Matt affair\non the other court; unfortunately it was Surrey\u2019s\nwho took the match with\na 21-16 22-20 victory.\nRanul, however, made\namends for his earlier loss\nto Surrey\u2019s Matt, winning\nhis 2nd\nmatch 21-13,\n21-17. That sealed the tie\nfor IC, and preserved the\nteam\u2019s perfect run.\nOf course, no match is\ncomplete without interviews of sort, so I asked\nNoah for a comment on\nthe team\u2019s performance\nthis season:\n\u201cThe key things this\nyear are the consistency\nof the guys playing week\nin week out, building\nchemistry as a team and\nsupporting each other on\nand off court. Everything\nthat\u2019s been achieved\nis because of the team\nplaying their hardest and\ndelivering the performances needed. As much\nas being the captain is\nimportant, doing this well\nrelies on the players being\nwilling to play, travel, and\nput in the performances,\nso I owe massive thanks\nto everyone that\u2019s played\nover the course of this\nyear.\u201d\n\u201cThe initial aim for next\nyear is to hold our own\nwithin the league, and if\nthings go well enough\nthen pushing again for a\nwin in that league too!\u201d\nI then asked Joseph for\ncomment about the club:\n\u201cIt\u2019s really great to\nsee all that the society\nhas achieved this year.\nNone of our other teams\nwere relegated and have\nall shown massive im-provements, meaning we\ncan push for promotions\nnext academic year. This\nyear\u2019s committee has also\nimproved the quality of\nbadminton events and\nsocials. The popular\nFriday coaching sessions\nhas seen large turnouts\nwith several players improving greatly over the\npast two terms.\u201d\n\u201cFurthermore, we\u2019ve\nsuccessfully hosted two\nLondon-wide tournaments this year thanks\nto our partnership with\nYonex. With the next\ncommittee decided, I\nreally hope the society\ncan continue to blossom.\u201d\nWe followed this up\nwith our last match,\nagainst Chichester \u2013 we\ndrew the tie 4-4, so lost\nour perfect record, but\nstill finished the season\nunbeaten.

Even Richard\n\u2018Bilbo\u2019 Thompson made\nit through the day without\nfrostbite. We saw many\nfantastic personal perfor-mances, including first\ntrail races, first marathons,\nand longest ultras. This is\na side of the club that is\ngoing from strength to\nstrength.\nFinally, huge thank-yous to Remy and family\nfor hosting us, trail captain\nHenry for organising the\ntrip, Luis for supporting,\nand the race organisers\nfor keeping everyone safe\nin spite of completely\nhorrendous conditions.\nFencing Men\u2019s Second Team finish a triumphant year\nI\nn terms of BUCS\npoints scored, fencing remains the most\nsuccessful club at\nImperial, and it has been\nan especially incredible\nseason for the Men\u2019s\nSecond team. Remaining\nundefeated throughout\nour fourteen matches has\nled to promotion to a tier\none league; a level never\nbefore reached by the\nteam.\nThe year started with\na strong home victory\nagainst Portsmouth,\n135-50, spurring on\nsupport. Our now eight\nmatch clean sheet was\nthreatened whilst fencing\nPortsmouth again, this\ntime away, and a nail\nbiting result of 135-124\ntaught us not to get\ncomplacent. Both Niklas\nand Cosmin were crucial\nteam members during first\nterm, especially for these\nclose league matches.\nThe team also claimed\nthe South Eastern Conference Cup. We quickly\nprogressed to the quarter-finals, where we beat our\nclosest league competi-tors, Brunel, 129-111.\nThe home semi-final\nmatch against LSE\ngathered a huge crowd,\nboth fencers and non-fenc-ers alike, who enjoyed\nsupporting with some\nappropriately-coloured\nblue pompoms. Using\nsome strategic planning,\nwe won the highly anticipated match with hits to\nspare.\nEight of us, armed with\ntwo supporters, travelled\nto Kent for the final. The\nsupport continued at\nhome, with nearly 3000\nviews on the Facebook\nlive stream. With the score\nset at 71-70, it all came\ndown to the final weapon,\nep\u00e9e. The score switched\nin favour of both teams\nthree times, and the match\nconcluded, 116-102, with\nthree decisive wins from\neach of the epeeist, Rob,\nJake and finally, performing under immense\npressure, Noah.\nFrom Rob\u2019s consistent\nflicks and David\u2019s signature spin, to Javier\u2019s\nincredible ability to fence\nall three weapons, and\nP\u00e9ter\u2019s scare tactics, each\nmember brought a different style to our matches.\nA number of memories\ndeserve a special mention:\nHugo\u2019s liberating party\nperformance; the christening of David\u2019s kitchen; the\nmultiple occasions where\nwe were unable to stop\nfor a service break; celebrating with magnums;\nand, of course, most of\nus enjoying ACC events\n(some more than others).\nMany thanks must go to\nteam members Noah and\nJavier as our designated\ndrives, and David Guo,\nour in-team photographer,\nas well as Sports Imperial,\nparticularly Yasmin, for\nall of the support and\norganisation.\nBoth Javier and\nCosmin have fenced their\nfinal season at Imperial.\nWe wish them good luck,\nand hope they return to\nsupport for years to come.\nThe team will be in\ngreat hands next year\nwith the newly elected\ncaptain, Hugo. We hope\nto continue our successes\nin our new league, and\nhave more to celebrate\nnext year.\nSPORTS\nHenry Maynard\nICXCAC Member\nSPORTS\nJake Reynolds\nFencing Men\u2019s 2nd\nCaptain\nDo you even lift? // IC Fencing\nICXCACtrailteamdefythemini-beastfromtheEastfortheEnduranceLifeCoastalTrailSeriesSussex.\n\n"

This\nis a very important fact\nto highlight, since many\narticles of the Spanish\nconstitution are being\npointed out and activated,\nand perhaps the most\nfundamental ones \u2013 the\nones that define Spain as\na democracy \u2013 are being\noverlooked by the central\ngovernment.\nOn the 10th\nOctober\n2017, the Catalan government proclaimed\nand annulled its inde-pendence, triggering\nthe activation of article\n155 of the Spanish Constitution. This article\nrequires the autonomous\ncommunities of Spain to\ncomply with the Spanish\nconstitution, and allows\nthe government to take\nany necessary measures\nin order for compliance\nto be ensured. In 2017,\nthese measures consisted of Spanish vice-pres-ident Mariano Rajoy\ndissolving the Catalan\nparliament and calling\nfor new elections; an\nact that effectively left\nthe Catalan government\ndestitute\nThe referendum\ncarried out on the 1st\nOctober was unquestionably illegal: aside\nfrom the many irregularities that occurred\nduring voting, which\nhave been corroborated\nby multiple delegations\nof international observ-ers, it was deemed an-ti-constitutional mainly\nbecause of the fact that\nit was announced to be\nlegally binding; and\nsuch legally binding\nreferendums can only\nbe called by the central\ngovernment.\nWhy then, are there\nclaims that the central\ngovernment is overlooking the rights of\nthe Catalan people for\nsel f-det erm i nat i on?\nSimply put, the central\ngovernment has offered\nno legal way for the\nCatalan people to decide\nif they want to be part of\nSpain or not. The central\ngovernment is fully\naware of the independence movement that\nhas arisen in Catalu\u00f1a.\nThere is a considerable\nproportion of the Catalan\ndemographic that has\nbeen asking to be heard\nfor years now, who have\nbeen overlooked by the\ncentral government one\ntoo many times. Whilst\nsome may argue that\nacknowledging this\nmovement would show\na sign of weakness, it is\nclear that this argument\nlacks critical thinking,\nsince this movement has\narisen from the discontent of how the central\ngovernment has been\nmanaging the country.\nThis discontent should\nnot come as a surprise,\ngiven the multiple\ncorruption scandals that\nhave been uncovered,\nor the drastic decline\nin standards of public\nhealthcare, schools, and\nservices across Catalonia, the reduction in\nworker\u2019s rights and pro-tections, and overall the\nvery poor performance\nof the Spanish economy.\nIf Mariano Rajoy\u2019s\ngovernment is fully\naware that only they can\nlegally call a referendum\nregarding the sovereignty of Catalu\u00f1a, and it\nis also aware that there\nis a sizeable portion of\nthe population that have\nexpressed their will to\nbe heard, how can the\nCatalan government\nbe condemned for not\nfollowing the constitu-tion, when the central\ngovernment is not\nfollowing democracy?\nIf, as the central government claims, they truly\nrepresent all the people\nof Spain, including\nthe Catalans, then why\nhasn\u2019t a nation-wide\nreferendum been called\nto ask all of Spain and\nCatalu\u00f1a their opinion\non this matter?\nBut perhaps the most\ndefined as public and\nviolent uprising for a\nseries of reasons, which\nincludes declaring\nthe independence of a\nnational territory. These\ncharges to leaders such\nas Charles Puigdemont,\nthe president of the\nCatalan government,\nwould be valid were\nthere any other legal\nalternatives given to\nholding the referendum.\nHowever, there aren\u2019t.\nPuigdemont has a duty\nto represent the Catalan\npeople as their elected\npresident, so charging\nhim with rebellion,\nsedition, and even embezzlement is the central\ngovernment\u2019s way of\nmaking it clear that they\ndo not intend on listening to or sitting down at\na negotiations table with\nthe Catalan government\nin order to offer a viable\nalternative. The charge\nof embezzlement is particularly ridiculous, as\nthe reason of the charge\nis that the Catalan\ngovernment used public\nfunds to finance the\nreferendum; because\nof this they are being\naccused of misuse of\nfunds. Does the central\ngovernment really\nexpect Puigdemont to\npay for the ballot boxes\nand the civil servants\nfrom his very own\npocket? Wouldn\u2019t it be\nmore suitable for them\nto investigate the 121,\n756 million Euros that\nhave been stolen due to\ncorruption to date by the\ncurrent party in power?\nPerhaps the most important question is the\nfollowing: is democracy\nreally democracy, if\nonly a few have the right\nvote?\nOne man was happy at the protests // Flickr\n\u201cThe central\ngovernment\nhas offered no\nlegal way for\nthe Catalan\npeople to\nmake a choice\u201d\nshameful and damaging\noutcome of this situation\nis the witch-hunt that\nhas stemmed from it.\nAs people take to the\nstreets in Catalu\u00f1a, in\nfrustration and anger\nfor having their voices\nignored over and over,\nleaders of these protests\nare being charged with\nsedition and rebellion.\nSedition is defined in\nthe Spanish legal code\nas the tumultuous and\npublic uprising to avoid\nthe enforcement of law.\nRebellion, in turn, is\n\n"

Here are some of her exciting adventures and the first challenges encountered in the tropics.\nTRAVEL\nO\nh God, where\nam I? All these\ntrees look the\nsame. The way\nup was easy (it was just,\nwell, up). But now every\ndirection is down, I can\u2019t\nhear the stream anymore\nand I can\u2019t see anything\nthrough these trees.\u201d\nSometimes in life, you\nfind yourself someplace\nodd and you struggle to\nunderstand how you came\nto be there.This was one of\nthose times for me \u2013 I was\nat the top of a mountain\nin the Amazon rainforest,\ncompletely alone, with a\nbag of cherimoya seeds in\none hand and a machete\nin the other. The trees\nwere thick; that place\nmight even be primary\nrainforest \u2013 a rare thing\nto come across where\nI was staying, an area\npreviously used for cattle\nfarming, with neighbours\nwho are digging for gold\nand planting cash crops.\nBut our plans for the land,\nin comparison, were a\nlittle more \u2018out there\u2019,\naccording to Ecuadorian\nstandards.\nLet me start from the\nbeginning: I had arrived\nin Ecuador four weeks\nearlier \u2013 my plane landed\nin Cuenca, a city popular\nwith American expats. I\nwas headed to a community called Terra Frutis,\nwho are trying to create\na vegan permaculture\nfruit forest in the Amazon\nrainforest. Not wanting\nto waste time anywhere\ntoo \u2018Americanised\u2019, the\nnext day I took a scenic\nyet frightening 4.5 hour\nbus journey from Cuenca\nto Gualaquiza in Morona\nSantiago province, a town\nat the edge of the Amazon\nrainforest. I passed\nover 20 places labelled\n\u2018peligro\u2019 \u2013 the Spanish\nword for \u2018danger\u2019 \u2013 as the\nbus wound around mountains across the Andes on\nroads that were yet to be\ncompleted. Back home\nI don\u2019t take buses, only\ntrains \u2013 not because I\u2019m\nstuck up or frightened of\nbuses, but rather because\nif the bus ride is over an\nhour long, I will throw\nup. And yet I somehow\nmanaged to survive this\n4.5 hour bus journey\nfeaturing some harrowing\ndrops. After a taxi ride\nfrom the bus station, I\narrived at a house I had\nonly seen in YouTube\nvideos. I was immediately\ngreeted by one of the men\nwho had started the Terra\nFrutis community three\nyears before, wandering\nthrough Peru and Ecuador\nuntil he eventually settled\nin this area.\nMy trip wasn\u2019t a\nholiday as such, more like\na summer internship. Most\npeople have internships\nWho has the better mane? // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\nFrom Imperial to the Amazon jungle\nFrutis are situated. I spent\nthe first week and a half\nat the headquarters, a\nsmaller scale version of\nthe main project, only\nwith electricity and the\ninternet (coming soon to\nthe farm!). Their \u2018yard\u2019 is\nfull of fruit trees, sugar-cane, and palms, backing\nonto a river suitable for\nbathing in. I spent a lot of\nmy time weeding, which\nin Ecuador often involves\ncutting shoulder-height\ngrass with a machete.\nThe grass is then used as\nmulch for the plants. I also\nplanted many pineapples\nand harvested noni, ugly\nlemons, and maracuyas.\nTambo is a nice place\nbut the real project is the\nfarm, known as Mount\nFrutis because of its\nlocation on the side of\na mountain, previously\nused for grazing cattle\nand not much else. There\nare a few ongoing jobs\nthere: building bungalows\nand a community kitchen\nin preparation for the\nupcoming fruit festival;\nplanting trees and seeds\ngathered from all over\nthe world; clearing areas\nof grass; weeding and\nlooking after existing\nplants; and maintaining\nthe waterline that brings\nwater from the stream to\nthe kitchen. The community is trying to become\nself-sufficient and aims\nto avoid buying new\nthings where possible,\nDelicious fruit of the Terra Frutis farm // Charlotte Pickering\nin a bank or some other\nsoul-sucking company,\nbut that\u2019s not the direction\nI want to take with my life.\nI used to love watching\nThe Good Life, where the\ntownies try to become\nself-sufficient, converting\ntheir gardens into veggie\nplots and making their\nown clothes, and the\nshow inspired me to do\nthe same \u2013 but better. I\u2019m\na big fruit lover, but the\nfruit in the UK is only\npassable, so I decided to\nmove to Ecuador (which\nhas a great climate for all\nsorts of fruit) and start a\nfruit forest. Thankfully\nfor my bank account and\nsanity, it didn\u2019t come to\nthat because someone else\nhad already started a fruit\nforest there, so I decided\nto join their community\nfor a trial month.\nSo now back to\nEcuador. I had just arrived\nin Tambo Viejo, where\nthe headquarters for Terra\nIn the jungle, the mighty jungle... // Charlotte Pickering\n\u201cThe rainforest\nis unforgiving\n\u2013 if you have\nany weakness,\nit will find it\nand make you\nsuffer\u201d\nHalfway up the mountain \u2013 the rainforest ain\u2019t no joke // Charlotte Pickering\nopting to make the things\nthey need in most cases.\nTools include a long pole\nwith a plunger on top for\nharvesting papayas, a long\npole with a sharp knife\non the end for harvesting\nrollinias, and branches\nthat bend back like a\nscythe for collecting the\ngrass and other potential\nmulch.\nSo finally, we went to\nthe farm \u2013 we needed to\ntake a half hour taxi ride,\nthen a boat journey, and an\nuphill walk through deep\nmud. This was the beginning of the dry season\nbut the moisture from\nthe rainy season hadn\u2019t\nmanaged to escape yet.\nI got to the cabin (one of\nthe seven buildings there)\nexhausted, had a short\nbreak, and then started\nplanting some mangoes.\nAt that point, my body\nwas done, and I spent the\nnext few days feeling faint\nand unable to stomach\nany food. The rainforest is\nunforgiving \u2013 if you have\nany weakness, it will find\nit and make you suffer.\nI somehow got back to\nTambo, where I got some\nrest, managed to recover,\nand then spent my days\neating cherimoya bought\nin town.\nCherimoya trees can\ngrow in this climate but\nare unlikely to fruit \u2013 I\nwasn\u2019t satisfied with\nthis. I wanted to grow\nthem at the farm, and so\ndid others. However, the\nproblem with growing\ncherimoyas out there is\nthat the altitude isn\u2019t high\nenough. So I decided that\nI would plant the seeds\nat the highest point of\nthe farm \u2013 the top of the\nmountain. This area of the\nfarm was not developed\nat all, there were no easy\npaths to walk around and\nonly a handful of people\nliving at the farm had\nbeen up there previously.\nIt was an early morning,\nand, having soaked the\nseeds for four days be-forehand, I scarified them\nagainst a rock to improve\ntheir chances of sprout-ing, and started my way\nup the mountain alone.\nI walked through tall\ngrass, crossed a river, and\nthen climbed through the\nthick rainforest. The trees\nwere densely packed but\nI kept heading up. After a\nwhile, there seemed to be\nno more up \u2013 the ground\nwas flat, and because of\nthe densely packed trees\nI couldn\u2019t see whether it\nwas going up or down in\nany direction. I seemed to\nbe able to see small pieces\nof sky in every direction\nhowever, so I stopped to\nhave a rest. A member of\nthe community had given\nme a granadilla so that\nI could spread the seeds\nonce I got to the top. I was\nhungry so I opened it up\nand ate the flesh, spitting\nthe seeds into holes at the\nbase of the trees around \u2013\nthat\u2019s how you plant the\nfruit here! Granadillas\ngrow on vines, so they\nneed to be planted places\nwith opportunities to\nclimb up things.\nAs I was walking\naround, I realised that in\none direction the ground\nseemed to go down and\nthen up again in the\ndistance \u2013 perhaps I\nwasn\u2019t at the summit yet?\nSo I picked up my things\nand started moving there.\nIt was difficult \u2013 that area\nwas even more densely\npopulated by trees. I got\nhigher than I had been,\nbefore fallen trees blocked\nmy path. Beyond them,\nI could see the ground\nevening off again so I\nassumed it to be the real\nsummit.\nI planted the cherimoya\nseeds all around and\nstarted to head downhill.\nI got to the place I was\nbefore, but I couldn\u2019t\nremember which direction\nI had come from. I headed\nleft, but with hindsight\nleft was completely the\nwrong way to go \u2013 it\nbegan to take me away\nfrom the farm and into\na neighbour\u2019s property.\nFortunately, I realised\nthat partway down as I\nhit a stream flowing in the\nopposite direction to what\nI was expecting. And so\nI headed back up a little\nand then started to make\nmy way around the peak.\nI couldn\u2019t hear the incorrect stream anymore so I\nkept walking until I heard\nwater... It was flowing the\ncorrect way, I must be in\nthe right place! I headed\nstraight for the stream,\nclimbed down to cross it,\nand, upon realising that\nthere was no easy way\nback up on the other side,\nI started walking down the\nstream.After a little while,\nI found a place to pull\nmyself up the other side.\nQuickly, the trees turned\nto grass but I couldn\u2019t recognise this place \u2013 had I\nended up at a neighbour\u2019s\nplace anyhow? I recited\n\u201clo siento, estoy perdida\u201d\n(\u201csorry, I am lost\u201d) in my\nhead and kept walking. I\nwalked past a few banana\npalms until I started seeing\nbuildings \u2013 I had made\nit back! I was higher up\nthan when I first crossed\nthe stream so I still had a\ndecent victory walk back\ndown to the kitchen. I\narrived back triumphant, I\nhad survived the Amazon\nrainforest!\nThe rest of the trip\nwas more relaxed, mostly\nweeding at Tambo and\nspending time with the\nfriends I\u2019ve made. After\ngettingusedtothistropical\nparadise, I was dreading\nreturning to England. But\nfast forward five months\nand I\u2019m back! Not for a\nvisit but to live. When\nthey said a maths degree\nfrom Imperial can take\nyou anywhere, I could\nhave never imagined it\nwould take me here.\nIf you\u2019re also a fruit\nlover interested in volunteering in the Amazon,\nor a vegan with an\ninterest in raw food and\npermaculture looking\nfor a community to join\nafter graduation, check\nout Terra Frutis at www.\nterrafrutis.com.

And\nit deserves more attention.\nThe backlash from\nthe Cambridge Analytica scandal provides a\nstark warning to those\nof us who share our\ninformation online \u2013 we\ncannot be certain who\nis accessing it, or how\nwe are being targeted\nthrough what we share.\nMeanwhile, a look\nback on the 2016 U.S.\nPresidential Election\nand the eruption of\n\u2018FAKE NEWS\u2019 demonstrates that external\ninterference with social\nmedia platforms has\nthe potential to literally\nchange the direction\nof an entire country.\nIn March, ICSMSU\nWelfare\u2019s Campaigns\nTeam decided to tackle\nanother issue with social\nmedia: the effect it is\nhaving on the mental\nhealth of young people.\nUndoubtedly, social\nmedia can have a\nharmful effect on our\nself-esteem and well-being. Designed in a\nmanner which mimics\nthe process of addiction\n\u2013 both psychologically\nand physiologically \u2013\nsocial media keeps us\nconstantly refreshing for\nnew content; receiving a\n\u2018like\u2019 can act as a form\nof social validation \u2013 a\nvalidation to which we\naspire whenever we\npost. In doing so, we\nall too often filter out\nthe imperfections in our\nlives, only sharing the\npositives while neglecting to mention our daily\nstruggles, failures, or\nworries.\nThis creates a harmful\ncycle, whereby we\nconstantly compare\nourselves to the perfect\nprojections we witness\nonline; we think we\ncannot be honest about\nour difficulties because\nthat is not something\nworthy of \u2018likes\u2019. As\nsuch, we create an environment where only\nsuccess and perfection is\ntalked about. ICSMSU\nWelfare sought to tackle\nthis by encouraging\nstudents to not just be\nonline, but #Online-Honestly.\nFor two weeks in\nMarch, we asked people\nto repost old pictures\nfrom social media\nunedited and unfiltered,\nwith a new caption\nhonest to the situation\nthey were actually\nfacing. By the fifth day,\nwe were overwhelmed\nby the level of engagement and support from\nstudents, not just in\nICSM, but across all of\nour Constituent Unions\nand even from students\nas far away as LSE and\nManchester. A senior\nmember of Faculty even\ndecided participate by\nmaking a post as part of\nthe campaign \u2013 resulting\nin a flurry of posts,\ntotalling 80 across all\nof social media by the\nclose of the campaign.\nWhen we planned\nit, we didn\u2019t dream of\nthe School of Medicine\nembracing it with such\nwarmth so quickly,\nnor did we anticipate\nhow brave so many\nof students would be\nto share their deeply\npersonal reflections on\nprevious social media\nposts and how many of\nthem would relate to\nthe message behind the\ncampaign.\nWhilst this campaign\nis over for now, we hope\nall of Imperial recognises every one of us\nis more than our online\nimage. We all have our\nunique problems and\nchallenges we face every\nday. We don\u2019t always\npresent that image\nof ourselves online\nbecause we think we\u2019re\nalone: this campaign has\nproved that we are not.\nLet\u2019s all go that extra\nmile to ask our friends\nhow they\u2019re doing.

I hope you\u2019re\nall excited for the\ndowns that accompany it. At the moment,\nthe main stress for me\ndoes not come from\nexams, but from the fact\nthat as of Monday we\nhave welcomed a new\nscaly skinned overlord\ninto our midst. Nearly\n1500 years after a lizard\nwas slain on the 23rd\nof April by St. George\nMichael, the scaly bastards have been waiting\nto reclaim the date for\ntheir own kind. As soon\nas the human baby was\nplucked from Kate\nMiddleton\u2019s uterus, the\nnewly formed foetus\nwas devoured and its\nskin used for the latest\naddition to the Royal\nBrood.\nIn a lighter vein, this\nweek around 30,000\nidiots decided to test their\nphysical endurance - and\nthe NHS - by running the\nLondon Marathon.\nI\u2019m unsure if you\u2019re\naware of the original fable\nthat spawned the sporting\nevent known as the\nmarathon, but it involved\na lot of Persians being\nslaughtered on a beach\nby significantly fewer\nGreeks. and then some\nAthenian runner named\nPheidippides jogged back\nto Athens to proclaim\nvictory. Unfortunately\nfor this particular herald,\nhe was so overcome on\narrival that his heart burst\nin his chest, dying just\nafter climatically delivering his message.\nA part of me wished\nhe never ran the 26 miles\nto so the marathon didn\u2019t\nexist. A larger part of me\nwishes that all those that\nran the London Marathon\nactually have a similar-ly-important task, rather\nthan simply wanting to\nbrag about their achievements to the rest of us.\nIf I\u2019m perfectly honest,\nI don\u2019t understand the\npoint of the exercise.\nPeople that run purport\nto do it for two reasons,\nthe first being fitness,\nand the second being the\nmoralistic goal of raising\nmoney for charity. I resent\nthe first reason mostly\nbecause I believe it contributes to the superficial\nnature of our society, but\nalso because running is so\nfucking boring. At least\ndo a sport that you can\ndo with other people and\ninvolves more than mean-inglessly putting one foot\nin front of the other like a\ntoddler learning to walk.\nAs for the second\nexcuse, I\u2019m just as likely\nto donate to charity for\nsomeone running 26+\nmiles as I am to someone\nnot doing any running at\nall \u2013 just ask the shits in\nthe RSPCA. Essentially,\nit\u2019s just yet another way\nof people proving their\ninnate superiority over the\nrest of us mere mortals\nincapable of performing\nthe same feat without\nmechanical assistance, or\nsevere alcoholism.\nI wish that they would\ngo the extra mile and\nremove this irritating\nhobby from my sight.\n\n"

The first team remain\nundefeated, retaining the Southern title, while the second team come a very respectable 2nd\nplace.\nSPORTS\nFilip \u0160ebest\n1st\nTeam Captain\nT\nhe University\nD o d g e b a l l\nLeague concluded this\nweekend with Imperial\nWolverines 1s retaining\nthe University League\nSouth title. Wolverines\n1s managed to finish the\nseason unbeaten. They\noverpowered everyone\nalong the way, including:\nHertfordshire A with their\nDodgeball World Cup finalist import; UCL Pumas\nwith their stretching of the\nrules both on and off the\ncourt; and UEA Falcons\n1s with their microscopic\nplayer who is literally\nimpossible to hit. Imperial\nnow venture to Leicester\nnext month to compete\nat the University League\nFinals, a final showdown\nof every regional league\nwinner to competing to be\ndodgeball\u2019s Cr\u00e8me de la\nCr\u00e8me.\nUntil Sunday, the\nLeague still had not been\nfully decided. A poor\nImperial effort could have\nallowed HertfordshireAto\nsnatch the league victory,\nregardless of Imperial\u2019s\ntwo victories over them\nalready. Wolverines 1s\nversus UCL Pumas would\nprove a pivotal game in\nthe ultimate league result.\nBidding for third place,\nUCL needed this win just\nas much as the league\nleaders did.\nThe fixture began, and\nImperial were quick to\nassert their dominance\nover the initial sets.\nUCL were very keen to\npressure Steve Ndumbe\ninto the corner, but quick\ncounter attacks from\nNithin Thoppuram helped\nequalise any deficits. A\nquick dominance turned\ninto a hard slog of having\nto earn every point to the\nbitter end. The scoreboard\nread 8-4 to Imperial just\nbefore the last set of the\nfirst half. Both teams gave\neverything and with only\nten seconds remaining,\nUCL found themselves a\nplayer up after some ferocious throwing. However,\na magical short distance\ncatch by Lochlann Allison\nthat forced him to the\nfloor just before the blow\nof the whistle turned\nwhat would have been a\nnerve-wrecking 8-6 half\ntime score into a slightly\nmore comfortable 10-4\nlead.\nHowever, UCL was far\nfrom done, and after the\nteams traded games in the\nsecond half, a chaotic set\nwith a number of questionable ref calls, including a\ncatch by next year\u2019s club\ncaptain Leo Haigh that\nwas not acknowledged,\nsaw our rivals reduce the\nlead to 12-8. At this point\nImperial stepped up their\ngame and employed the\ntactic they are best at \u2013\nsystematic and organised\nplay, aimed at maximising\nthe time each set lasts,\nslowly (in the case of\nUCL rather quickly) infuriating the opponent and\nforcing them to make silly\nmistakes.\nGetting the last\nWolverine off the court\nproved to be an insurmountable obstacle for\nthe UCL team and with a\nseries of catch-and-outs\nby Vinolan Arulananthan,\nFilip Sebest, and George\nFish, only three more\ngames were played in the\nsecond half, two of which\nwent to Imperial for a\nfinal score of 16-10. This\nmatch secured the league\nvictory for the Imperial 1s\nregardless of the last game\nagainst UEA 1s, which\nfor completion ended in\nfavour of Imperial with\nthe score of 19-5. UCL\nwere destined for 4th\nplace\nas a consequence.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t just\nthe 1s celebrating \u2013 our\n2s had a very successful\nseason too, finishing 2nd\nout of all second teams,\nwith a strong last weekend\nepitomised by MVP Yan\nJin and her remarkable\ncatching. Nonetheless, it\nwasn\u2019tallplainsailing,and\nthey had their fair share of\nadversity to overcome: an\nabsent captain, a player\nwith literally no concept\nof time, and a yogurt with\nridiculous on-court antics.\nThe final match of the\nleague between Imperial\n2s and Southampton\n2s was to decide who\nwould take the 2nd\nplace\namongst all the second\nteams. Intelligent calling\nand powerful throwing by\nNifemi Adejumobi saw\nthe 2s take an early 7-1\nlead. The Southampton\nteam would have none of\nthat and with a couple of\norganised games targeting our wingmen, they\nquickly caught up to 7-5\nand had hope at half time.\nLuckily, the second\nhalf was more convincing\nfrom our 2s, with an\neye-catching diving dodge\nby Mink Radtanajiravong,\na pirouette dodge by Jinay\nPatel, and multiple catches\ncoming from Yan Jin and\nJames Mellor-Rice. Great\nteam effort saw the 2s\npull out an overall 17-9\nvictory over a spirited and\nfriendly Southampton 2nd\nteam.\nThe excitement is not\njust contained to the court\nhowever, with AGM\npromises of a tour, extra\nsocials, and Hugo Boss\nkit, next year is shaping to\nbe another great year for\nImperial Dodgeball, as we\nseek to maintain the title\nand establish our inaugural women\u2019s team. So if\nyou want to get involved\nin our competitive mixed\nteams next year, or want\nto join one of our many\nsocial members, look\nout for the Wolverine\nsign at Fresher\u2019s Fair.\nAnd remember: Throw\nTogether, Dodge Alone.\nImperial Wolverines 2s player preparing to strike // IC Wolverines\nImperial Wolverines 1st\nteam posing with their trophies // IC Wolverines\n\n"

Cole\u2019s latest release, KOD, is marked by mature\nlyrical content, but is hampered by sloppy technique.\nN\north Carolina\nrapper, J. Cole,\nfamous for\nhis poetically\ncolourful and hard-hitting\nlyricism, as well as his\nsmooth charisma, comes\nthrough on KOD to tell\nhis tales of addiction and\ndrug abuse. In contrast to\nhis previous release \u2013 the\ncritically-acclaimed,\ncommercially successful,\nand highly political 4\nYour Eyez Only \u2013 J. Cole\nfocuses a lot more on\npersonal stories, experi-ences, and life lessons,\nputting his politics on the\nback seat. This change in\nthematic focus is reflected\nin the instrumental and\nvocal arrangements of\nthe album: the vocals are\noften subdued and distant;\nthe samples are calm and\natmospheric; the beats\nfeel more laid back. On\nsome tracks he makes\nuse of a female narrator,\nwho brings the deeper\nconcepts of the album to\nthe forefront, elucidating\nideas about life, suffering,\nand how it is important\nto \u2018choose wisely\u2019 when\ndeciding on how to deal\nwith this suffering.\nThe only listed features\non this album are from\nkiLL edward, performing\non the songs \u2018The Cut\nOff\u2019 and \u2018FRIENDS\u2019. He\ngenerally does the songs\njustice, especially his part\nin \u2018FRIENDS\u2019, which\nis outstanding, but his\ndelivery of the hook on\n\u2018The Cut Off\u2019 does come\noff a little awkward, and\nthe performance is also a\nbit messy at times.\nThis actually seems to\nbe a pervasive problem\n\u201cThere are\nmoments\nwhere\nimmersion\ninto J. Cole\u2019s\nworld is nearly\nimpossible\u201d\nunsurprisingly, the only\none that has gotten the\nvideo treatment so far.\nThere are no songs like\n\u2018Deja Vu\u2019, \u2018Neighbours\u2019,\nor \u2018No Role Modelz\u2019 on\nthis record.\nCole\u2019s bars are as\npowerful as ever and his\ncharm still shines through,\nand this saves a lot of the\nrecord, in my opinion. But\nnone of this really matters\nwhen the songs are fundamentally uninteresting\nand unmemorable. Were\nit not for the themes he\ntouches upon and the\nrelevance of these to the\nculture we live in at the\nmoment, I would have to\ngive him a much lower\nscore. The surface stories\nabout drug addiction and\nsocial media romances\nserve as a gateway to\nmuch deeper philosophical ideas about life.\nAlso, rather surprising-ly, J. Cole heavily censors\nhis own words on this\nrecord, using tape stop\neffects to blur out profan-ities. At first this put me\noff, but I now think it was\ndone for a good reason:\nCole tries to portray\nhimself as a father-figure\nin the hip-hop scene on\nthis record, even more so\nthan on 4 Your Eyez Only.\nBy removing the profanity\nhe can avoid the \u2018parental\nadvisory\u2019 sticker on his\nalbum cover and thus\nreach a younger audience.\nIn a culture of increasing\nnihilism and a greater\nsense of aimlessness,\nyoung people will look\nfor strong father figures\nto point them in the right\ndirection.\nThe last track on the\nalbum, \u20181985\u2019, is a sort\nof diss track aimed at all\nthe new, up-and-coming\nSoundCloud rappers (Lil\u2019\nPump, 6ix9ine etc.). I call\nit a \u2018sort of diss track\u2019\nbecause it isn\u2019t aimed at\nanyone specifically, but\nrather sees J. Cole trying\nto mentor younger artists\nin the ways of the music\nindustry, warning them\nabout the dangers of\nexcess and chasing trends.\nI have very mixed\nfeelings about this album.\nWhile the subject matter\nand the lyrics, as well as\nJ. Cole\u2019s personality, are\nas great as ever, there are\nsore spots on this record\nwhich cannot be ignored.\nArtists of Cole\u2019s caliber\nshouldn\u2019t make the kinds\nof mistakes that he makes\non this release. Apparently he recorded this album\nwithin a timespan of two\nweeks. It shows.\nAlice in Wonderland had taken a dark turn // Dreamville\nMUSIC\nBen Tenmann\nMusic Writer\nArtist: J. Cole. Label:\nDreamville. Top Tracks:\nATM; Kevin\u2019s Heart;\nWindow Pain. For Fans\nOf: Kendrick Lamar; Joey\nBada$$, Jay-Z. 42 minutes\nKOD\nwith this album: the recording of the vocals feels\nrushed. The lyricism and\nproduction are as strong as\never, and, in my opinion,\nthe themes are the best\nJ. Cole has ever touched\nupon. Unfortunately,\nhowever, there are a few\nmoments in which immersion into the world J. Cole\nis trying create becomes\nnearly impossible. Vocal\nperformances which are\nway off key and/or sloppy\nruin the moody atmosphere that the songs are\ntrying to convey.\nA good example of this\nwould be \u2018Once an Addict\n(Interlude)\u2019: muffled\nelectric pianos playing\nmoody chords open the\nsong, instantaneously immersing you. But then, out\nof nowhere, a vocal line,\nso off key it would even\nmake your drunk friends\nat the karaoke bar cringe,\npulls you right out of that\nimmersion. \u201cSomething\u2019s\ngot a hold on me\u201d, Cole\ncroons in a pitch that\nsounds way too high for\nhis register.\nAnother problem this\nalbum suffers from is\nthat none of the songs are\nparticularly memorable.\nThere is a severe lack of\nstrong hooks throughout\nthis record, save for one\ntrack, \u2018ATM\u2019, which\nstands out quite clearly as\nthe strongest song. It is,\nJ. Cole\u2019s feeling broody // Wikimedia\n\n"

It will\nbe closed throughout the\nsummer break, and will\nnot reopen until October\n2018.\nIn a statement, the\nCollege said the change\nwas \u201cpart of longer term\nefforts to improve facili-ty-related student examination experiences\u201d,\nsaying it was \u201cdirectly\nlinked to over 500 individual pieces of student\nfeedback about what\nconstitutes an acceptable\nexamination venue.\u201d\nStudents are invited to\nuse the Senior Common\nRoom restaurant during\nthis period, which is\nusually only open to\npostgraduate students and\nstaff.\nHowever, students and\nstaff Felix spoke to cited\nlong-running concerns\nover the length of queues\nat Imperial-owned outlets,\nwhich could be exacerbated by the decision to temporarily close the Queen\u2019s\nTower Rooms Restaurant.\nFollowing the launch\nof the Campus Services\nSurvey by Imperial\nCollege Union earlier this\nyear, one academic reported receiving complaints\nfrom students about long\nwaiting times. \u201cThey\nusually only get one hour\nto eat between lectures,\nand are not happy to\nspend their lunch break in\na queue or finding a seat.\u201d\nthey said, \u201cThey do not\nhave time to eat or relax.\u201d\nThe survey was\ntriggered, in part, by\nwide ranging changes to\ncampus services that went\ninto effect last summer,\nincluding removal of\ncooked SCR breakfasts.\nnon-consensual sex with a\nstaff member. 15 respondents reported being sexually assaulted or raped by\na staff member.\nThe survey found the\nperpetrators of these acts\nwere mostly academics\nrather than other staff\nmembers. Around 60% of\nreported perpetrators were\nmen and 13% women;\nthese gender ratios were\nalso seen with victims,\nwith women being more\nlikely than men to experience sexual misconduct.\nNearly 15% of postgraduate respondents reported\nbeing made to take part\nin sexualised discussions,\ncompared to 6% of under-graduates.\nA lack of boundaries\nwithin student-staff relationships were also highlighted in the report. 80%\nof respondents felt staff\nhaving sexual relationships with students made\nthem \u2018somewhat\u2019 to \u2018very\nuncomfortable\u2019, while\n40% felt uncomfortable\nabout getting drunk with\nstaff members.\nMisconduct had a\nnotable effect on victims,\nranging from loss of\nconfidence to a change in\ndegree course or career\npath. Reporting of such\nincidents was found to be\nlacking, with only 10%\nof respondents reporting\nmisconduct to their insti-tution, the major reason\nbeing that victims are\nunsure if the behaviour\nwas serious enough to\nwarrant complaint.\nWhere incidents are\nreported, 90% of respondents felt institutions failed\nto adequately respond,\nwith some saying institutions rendered the process\ndifficult or even denied\nthe incident altogether.\nOnly one in four respondents found that their University or College took\nproactive steps to prevent\nmisconduct.\nDr Emma Chapman, a\nresearch fellow at Imperial who is a member of the\n1752 Group told Felix:\n\u201cThis research rightly\nplaced accountability not\njust on the perpetrators\nbut also on the university frameworks which\nprotect them. Inadequate\nreporting pathways and\nopaque and discriminatory disciplinary processes\nkeep higher education a\ngendered experience and\nprevent true equal access\nto education.\u201d\nLast month Felix\nreported on their\ncollege-wide survey\ninvestigating sexism at\nImperial. It found that\n40% of respondents had\nfaced misogyny, and\n70% had experienced\nderogatory comments\nfrom peers. Only one in\nthree respondents agreed\nenough support was given\nto discrimination victims.\nCommenting on the\nreport, the College stated:\n\u201cImperial is committed to\npromoting an environment\nwhere everyone feels safe,\nsupported, and respected.\nAny kind of sexual assault\nor harassment is entirely\nunacceptable and has no\nplace within our community\u201d.\nProfessor Stephen\nCurry, Assistant Provost\nfor Equality, Diversity,\nand Inclusion, who spoke\nto Felix last month, said:\n\u201cOne of the major pieces\nof work we\u2019re starting is\na working group dealing\nwith sexual harassment at\nthe university. It will look\nacross the board at staff\nand student experiences,\nand come up with a unified\nset of policies and procedures that create a credible\nreporting system\u201d.\nDr Chapman said:\n\u201cUniversities need to\nurgently invest in tackling\nthis issue and I am happy\nto say that Imperial is one\nof the universities leading\nthis charge with their\nnewly convened sexual\nharassment policy reform\nworking group.

The\natrocities committed\nagainst the diviners are\nhard enough on the reader,\nlet alone when considered\nin the context of the Black\nLives Matter movement.\nIn the Author\u2019s Note at\nthe end of the book, parallels are drawn between\nreal people and characters\nof the book \u2013 children,\nmothers, and innocents.\nIt drags the reader back\ninto a harsh reality; all the\nemotions felt throughout\nthe novel are forced onto\nstories you\u2019ve seen on the\nnews.\n\u201cThe book\nwould often\nforce me into\nmoments of\ncontemplation\nor sombre\nsilence\u201d\n\u201cWhy do all\nYA books\nneed the\nprotagonist\nto fall in love?\nAnd why\nare the love\ninterests so\nterrible?\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s not all about\nsorrow. Adeyemi has\ndiscussed her desire give\na young readership protagonists in whom they\ncould see themselves,\nsomething she had never\nfound for herself. On\nthe author\u2019s YouTube\nchannel, there is a video\nof her holding the book in\nher hands for the first time\nwhich shows her passion.\nThrough her tears, you\ncan see how important it\nis to her, and it will be to\ncountless others.\nChildren of Blood and\nBone is drawing lots of\nattention. It may not have\nexploded in the media as\nBlack Panther did, but\nboth stories are starting\nmany a discussion. It has\nheld its place on the New\nYork Times bestsellers list\nfor the last six weeks. A\ndeal for not one but three\nfilms was announced\nbefore the book was even\nreleased. Pretty impressive for a 24-year-old\ndebut author.\nIf it wasn\u2019t branded YA,\nand if the cast wasn\u2019t filled\nwith teens, it may have\nbeen even more popular.\nBut it doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe the age of the target\naudience that makes many\nrecoil \u2013 you don\u2019t see\nanyone shying away from\nHarry Potter for being a\nkid\u2019s book. The problem\nis much more specific to\nYA itself. Many people\nare put off by a reputation\nof re-hashed plots, clich\u00e9d\nwriting, and the same\nbland girls falling for bad\nboys.\nSadly, not all of those\nproblems are resolved by\nAdeyemi.\nHer writing style isn\u2019t\nnecessarily one to sing\nabout. It\u2019s easy to read,\nwhich isn\u2019t a bad thing\n\u2013 there isn\u2019t an elaborate\nstyle which could disori-entate or distract from the\nplot. Anyone could read\nit, and that\u2019s good \u2013 this\nbook should reach as\nmany people as possible.\nWhat did irk me about\nthe writing was the incessant use of interruption. So\nmany times, the narrator\nwould be cut short mid\nwor\u2013\n\u201cOnly for their train of\nthought to be completed,\u201d\nby another character.\nSure, it\u2019s fine once, but\nit\u2019s annoying as soon as it\nbecomes noticeable. This\nforced effort to be quirky\nis found too often in books\nof this kind.\nIt\u2019s annoying, but at\nleast it\u2019s not problemat-ic, unlike the romance\nshoehorned into Children\nof Blood and Bone, and\nmany other YA books.\nWhy do they all need the\nprotagonist to fall in love?\nAnd why are the love\ninterests so often terrible\npeople?\nIt\u2019s happened ever\nsince Twilight popularised\nYA books \u2013 maybe that\u2019s\nwhat started the trend of\nunhealthy relationships.\nIn this case, Adeyemi tries\nto convince the reader that\na villain is good boyfriend\nmaterial. Some of his acts\nare justified, and he has a\nlittle hero in him, but who\nwants to be with someone\nthey\u2019ve seen commit\nmurder and arson?\nFor a book with a young\ntarget audience, it is not\nappropriate. It\u2019s not even\nrequired for the story; the\nsame outcome could be\nreached with friendship\ninstead of romance.\nThis isn\u2019t the only\noffence, but it is the worst.\nAt least the other relationship that\u2019s toyed with is\nbetween two good, wholesome characters. Still, for\na book focussing on four\nteenagers, it\u2019s a little too\nneat to have two couples.\nI\u2019m thankful there isn\u2019t a\nlove triangle.\nChildren of Blood and\nBone deserves all the\nhype it\u2019s receiving and\nmore, but it\u2019s by no means\nperfect. The diversity that\nit brings to YA should be\ncelebrated, its legacy con-tinued. The dysfunctional\nrelationships between the\ncharacters should not.\nAdeyemi\u2019s debut takes on modern politics and West African mythology // Elena Seibert\nBOOKS\nAlice Peberdy\nBooks Editor\nMacmillan. 544 pp.\nCHILDREN OF BLOOD\nAND BONE\nby Tomi Adeyemi\n\n"

Or Paris,\nto be more precise \u2013 the\nParis of aesthetes and\nlovers, who tend towards\nthe philosophical and\ndress chicly, with nary a\nbanlieue in sight. Binoche\nplays Isabelle, a divorced\nartist looking for her true\nlove and crying herself\nto sleep at night. We\nfollow Isabelle as she\npasses through the arms\nof a number of unsuitable\nmen \u2013 unsuitable, in some\ncases, because they are\npossessive and boorish,\nwhile in others Isabelle\nmakes herself unsuitable\nby locking herself away in\nher upper-class bubble.\nThe whole film \u2013 which\nwas based on Roland\nBarthes\u2019 A Lover\u2019s Discourse: Fragments, and\nwritten by Denis and\ncollaborator Christine\nAngot \u2013 is meditative\nand slow-moving; to say\nit veers into indulgence\nwould be an understate-ment. Most of the film is\ntaken up by conversations\nbetween Isabelle and the\nmen in her life, during\nwhich Denis\u2019 camera\nlanguidly swings between\n\u201cBinoche is\n\u2013 as usual \u2013\nresplendent\nin Let the\nSunshine In\u201d\nthe two sets of faces like\na ponderous metronome.\nThese sequences are\nenjoyable, up to a point,\nbut heavy dialogue masks\na sense that little of real\nvalue is being said.\nBinoche, is \u2013 as usual\n\u2013 resplendent in the role,\ngiving a performance that\nis imbued with a blinding\nglow. Despite the dia-logue-heavy nature of the\nscript, Binoche displays\nthe most affecting aspects\nof her performance when\nshe relies solely on her\nexpression to sell the\nstory: staring out of a train\nwindow, lost for words.\nPeake is Funny Cow\n\u2013 she plays the titular\ncharacter, who is never\nafforded a name \u2013 always\nmanages to find the right\nwords. Set in the North\nof England in the 1970s\nand 80s, the film charts\nthe life of Funny Cow,\na working class woman\ntrying to break into the\nmale-dominated comedy\ncircuit. The funniest thing\nabout Funny Cow, is,\nsurprisingly, the lack of\nhumour. Instead, Shergold\nhas taken the opportunity\nto explore the limitations\nand strictures placed upon\nwomen by society.\nAs with Binoche,\nPeake is by far the best\nthing about Funny Cow.\nWith an exceptional\near for dialogue, Peake\ndelivers each line to\nperfection, often reverting to the deadpan\nsarcasm that served as an\nemotional shield for her\nwhile growing up. It\u2019s\nthe cumulative effect of\nsmall details that really\nsell her performance \u2013 the\nrange of emotions Peake\u2019s\nface goes through as\nshe struggles through an\nabortive audition, filmed\nin relentless close-up, or\nthe fact her hands remain\ntrembling even when she\nmanages to blast through\nin her first live set.\nIn both films, the lead\nactors\u2019 abilities mean\ntheir support tends to\nfade into the background\na little bit; Let the\nSunshine In ends with\na memorable exchange\nbetween Binoche and\nGerard Depardieu, who\nplays a fortune-teller, and\nin Funny Cow Peake is\nably supported by Paddy\nConsidine as Angus, who\nplays her middle-class\nlover, but both films serve\nas showcases for an individual talent.\nBoth films excel in exploring a particular social\nclass. In Let the Sunshine\nIn, it\u2019s the upper-class\nworld of bankers and art\ndealers; a metropolitan\nelite, sipping champagne,\nwho probably haunt Nigel\nFarage\u2019s nightmares.\nFunny Cow explores the\npolar opposite: working\nclass Northern communities who were decimated\nby Thatcherism throughout the 1980s, and have\nyet to recover. Funny Cow\nexplores, in affecting,\ndepressing detail, the\nway cycles of poverty\nand violence are passed\ndown through generations\n\u2013 Funny Cow\u2019s abusive\nfather dies when she is\nyoung, but it\u2019s not long\nbefore she too is trapped\nin a relationship with a\nviolent man, from whom\nshe manages to escape. In\na lesser film, Considine\u2019s\nAngus would act as a\ncorrective for Funny Cow,\nintroducing her to a world\nof culture and class, but\nshe recognises this, too,\ncan be a form of violence.\nBut while both films\nshow the protagonist at\nthe mercy of men, Funny\nCow creates a well-round-ed, realistic character, who\nhas her own lived experience and vitality. Isabelle,\non the other hand, exists\nsolely in relation to the\nmen around her. We are\ntold, or must presume, she\nis a successful artist, yet\nshe is only seen working\non a canvas once, and\nwe know next to nothing\nabout her life outside of\nits romances. Her character is like a ghost, and\nthe film has a hollowness\nat its centre that does\nnot satisfy. While Funny\nCow can often feel over-ly-structured or fragmented \u2013 a result, perhaps,\nof the director\u2019s ample\nexperience in television \u2013\nit is much more satisfying\nthan the naturalism Denis\noffers up.\nBoth films are marked\nby a lack of resolution:\nIsabelle and Funny Cow\nboth have futures left\nwide open. While Funny\nCow is more triumphant,\nit refuses an easy ending\n\u2013 instead of having Funny\nCow beat the male comics\nat their own game, or\ntranscend an arena of\ncomedy so reliant on\nracism, sexism, and hom-ophobia, she joins them\nin punching down. Funny\nCow and Let the Sunshine\nIn both end with things\nstill in play: Peake and\nBinoche deserve nothing\nless.\nMaxine making\u2018em laugh // Entertainment One/Curiosa Films\nFILM\nDir: Adrian Shergold.\nScript: Tony Pitts.

The\nUnion will invest its\nreserves and part of the\nClubs, Societies and\nProjects funding ac-count, stating the money\nwould only lose in value\nif left untouched, due to\ninflation.\nThe responses have\nbeen taken into consideration by the Union\u2019s\nFinance and Risk\nImperial computing professor detained in Iran\nwho is based at Imperial\u2019s\nDepartment of Computing, was arrested by Iran\u2019s\nRevolutionary Guards on\nthe 15th April, according\nto a human rights group.\nThe Centre for Human\nRights in Iran (CHRI),\na US-based non-profit,\nreported Professor Edalat\nrefused to post bail this\nWednesday, leading to\nhim being taken into\ncustody. A source told the\nCGHI Professor Edalat\u2019s\nhome was raided, and his\nbelongings seized.\nThe Foreign Office\nthis week stated they\nwere \u201curgently seeking\ninformation from the\nIranian authorities\u201d about\nProfessor Edalat.\nIn a statement, the\nCollege said: \"We are\nunderstandably concerned\nfor his welfare following\nreports of his arrest, and\nwe are urgently seeking\nfurther information.\"\nProfessor Edalat is\nbelieved to have been in\nIran to attend an academic\nworkshop.\nAs well as his academic\ncareer, Professor Edalat is\nthe founder of the Campaign Against Sanctions\nand Military Intervention\nin Iran (CASMII), which\ncampaigns against foreign\ninterventions in Iran. He\npreviously told Times\nHigher Education he\nwould not be submitting research papers to\nUS-based conferences\nin protest to President\nDonald Trump\u2019s restrictions on vias.\nProfessor Edalat is one\nof a number of high-pro-file arrests of Iranian dual\nnationals. Since 2015, the\nRevolutionary Guards\nhave arrested 30 dual\nnationals; the majority\nhave been accused of\nespionage.\nEarlier this year Dr\nKaveh Madani, a Reader\nat Imperial\u2019s Centre for\nEnvironmental Policy,\nwas detained for 72 hours\nin Iran. Dr Madani had\nbeen made Deputy Head\nof Iran\u2019s Department of\nEnvironment last year, a\nposition from which he\nresigned last week.\nHadi Ghaemi, executive director of the CHRI,\nsaid of the arrest: \u201cIran\u2019s\ncontinued arbitrary\narrests of dual nationals\nwithout transparency and\nlack of due process is extremely concerning.\u201d The\nInternational Observatory\nof Human Rights accused\nthe Iranian government\nof using dual-nationals\nas \u201cbargaining chips in\nTehran\u2019s ongoing negotiations with the West.\u201d\nCommittee, who will be\ndiscussing the potential\nethical dilemmas, as well\nas the risks and returns\nthat each option brings.\nMatt Blackett, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) told Felix: \u201cA staff\nand student panel met all\nof the shortlisted fund\nmanagers on Tuesday\nand, guided by student\ninput throughout, they\nhave reached a decision.\nOnce the paperwork is\ndone, we look forward to\ntelling our members how\nwe\u2019re putting our reserves\nto work so we can fund\neven more activities and\nevents\u201d.\nIn a statement, Divest\nImperial \u2013 a student-run\ncampaign pressuring the\nUnion and College to\nwithdraw investments\nfrom fossil fuels \u2013 has\naccused the survey\nof being misleading,\nfactually incorrect, and\nundermining student\ncampaigning and democ-racy. They stated: \u201cThe\nsurvey directly equates\nthe exclusion of fossil\nfuels, armaments, alcohol,\ngambling, pornography\nand tobacco from a portfolio with a \u2018severe risk\u2019,\nwhich is misleading and\nclearly lends itself to bias.\nThere was also no attempt\nto explain the arguments,\nincluding financial,\nin favour of moving\ninvestments away from\nfossil fuels, potentially\nundermining the Union\u2019s\nexisting commitments to\ndivestment and support\nfor the campaign. Although we expressed our\nconcerns to the DPFS\ndirectly following the\nsurvey launch, we are yet\nto receive a response. We\nhope the Union will fulfil\nits original resolution to\nfully divest from fossil\nfuels, communicate more\neffectively with students\nin future, and work with\nus in holding university\nmanagement to account\non this issue\u201d.\nLast year the Union\nmade the commitment to\nno longer invest in fossil\nfuel and to implement\nalternative responsible\ninvestment strategies. The\nCouncil paper implementing the decision, brought\nforward by Rhidian\nThomas (Ethics & Environment Officer) and\nsupported by the Divest\nImperial campaign, has\nestimated that the college\ndirectly invested \u00a35.4\nmillion in fossil fuel\ncompanies with further\ninvestments been made\nby externally managed\nfunds. It was believed that\nImperial was one of the\ntop investors among UK\nuniversities.\nThe paper also highlighted that the increase in\nglobal temperatures is due\nlargely to burning of fossil\nfuels, that some of these\ncompanies have been implicated in cases of human\nrights abuses, and their\noverall image did not fit in\nwith the Union\u2019s values.\nImperial College\nLondon has been found to\nbe one of the least ethical\ninvestors within higher\neducation in the People\nand Planet University\nleague table, ranking at\nthe 141st\nplace \u2013 the lowest\namongst the Russell\nGroup. An investigation\nby Felix earlier this year\nshowed the College was\ninvesting \u00a33.5 million\nin the tobacco industry,\nnearly \u00a39 million in the\nfossil fuel industry, \u00a33.1\nmillion in the arms indus-try, and over \u00a316 million\nin pharmaceuticals, out of\na total fund of over \u00a3266\nmillion.\nCompanies that\nreceived investment\nfrom the College, such\nas Exxon and Shell, have\nbeen accused of burying\nevidence of global\nwarming and committing\ncrimes against humanity.\nOne academic told\nFelix: \u201cThe world looks\nto us to set the agenda\nof research; how can we\nlead from the front when\nour eyes are still squarely\nfocused on the past and its\nformer cash cows \u2013 fossil\nfuels\u201d.\nThe survey can be\naccessed here: https://bit.\nly/2HuOGGE\nA protest at the University of Oxford over divestment // Flickr/Kamyar Adl\nUnion launches ethical investment survey\nUCU call off further strike action, as debates around\ntuition fee refunds continue\nNEWS\nStrike action has\nbeen called off as\nUCU and UUK reach\nagreement, but\npressure is mounting\nfor fee refunds.\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nM\nembers of\nthe University and\nC o l l e g e\nUnion (UCU) earlier\nthis month voted to\naccept proposals from\nUniversities UK (UUK),\ncancelling strike action\nscheduled for later this\nterm.\nIn a ballot, whose\nresults were revealed on\nthe 13th\nApril, 64% of\nmembers voted to accept\nthe pensions offer from\nUUK, with 36% voting\nto reject the offer. Overall\nturnout from members\nwas 63.5%.\nThe proposal put\nforward by UUK, the\nregulator of universities\nin the UK, included maintenance of the current\npension scheme until at\nleast April 2019, continued discussion between\nparties, and establishment\nof a Joint Expert Panel.\nThe Panel, which would\nbe composed of academics and actuarial experts,\nwould report on valuation\nof the current pension\nscheme.\nThe agreement came\nshortly after 14 days of\nindustrial action by UCU\nmembers came to an end.\nThe strikes were called\nover changes to the Universities Superannuation\nScheme (USS), which\nUCU said would mean\nmembers of the scheme\nwould lose out on \u00a310,000\nper year in pension\nfunds. As a result of the\naction, students across 65\nuniversities lost out on\nscheduled teaching time.\nAt Imperial, students\nhave been assured they\nwill not be examined on\nmissed content, with the\nCollege saying they were\n\u201ccommitted to putting\nmeasures in place that\nwill safeguard [students\u2019]\nability to progress or\ngraduate.\u201d\nUCU had originally\nplanned a further 14 days\nof strike action, timed to\ncoincide with the examination period of many\nuniversities. This has been\npostponed following the\nagreement.\nThe development was\nwelcomed by the College,\nwith Professor Alice Gast,\nPresident, and Professor\nJames Stirling, Provost,\ntelling staff it was \u201ca\nwelcome step forward,\nand in line with our call\nin February to convene an\nexpert group.\u201d\nRoddy Slorach, Imperial College UCU\u2019s Diversity Officer, told Felix\n\u201cThe UUK offer removed\nthe immediate threat of\nthe drastic change to our\npensions, although it\nprovided few other guar-antees. A large majority of\nUCU members voted Yes\nin the hope the Independent Expert Panel could\nsort out the valuation and\nreduce the \u2018deficit\u2019\u201d\nHowever, he cautioned\nthe vote was \u201cabsolutely\nnot a vote of confidence in\nUUK\u201d, saying if the panel\nrecommended pension\ncuts, another ballot on\nfurther industrial action\nwould need to be called.\nHe highlighted the rela-tionthesestrikeshavewith\ngeneral developments in\nhigher education: \u201cIt\u2019s\nimportant to recognise the\nbroader issues that have\ndriven this dispute. The\nattacks on our pensions\ncan be traced back to the\ncreation of tuition fees\nand a market in education.\nSince then, universities\nhave increasingly seen\nthemselves as competi-tors, with students seen\nas customers and staff as\ncosts to be cut.\u201d\nDr Michael McGarvey,\nPresident of Imperial\nCollege UCU, told Felix\nUCU membership at\nImperial had increased\nby 60% over the dispute\nperiod. \"Management\nshould be under no\nillusion that this decision\nis a sign of weakness,\"\nhe said, \"We expect the\nuniversity employers at\nImperial and throughout\nthe UK to act in good\nfaith. However, if there\nis no acceptable outcome\nfrom the Panel then UCU\ncan resume strike action.\"\nFee Refunds\nWhile an agreement\nhas been reached between\nUUK and UCU, disagreements about whether or\nnot to refund tuition fees\nto students affected by last\nterm\u2019s strikes are ongoing.\nA petition that circulated at the end of last\nterms asking for a refund\nof tuition fees in light\nof missed teaching was\nsigned by over 3,000\nImperial students. It was\ndelivered to senior management at the College,\nwho have thus far refused\nto confirm whether they\nwill be refunding fees.\nA statement on the\nCollege website, which\nwas also sent out to several\nstudents by Professor\nGast, says: \u201cyour fees\ncover all aspects of your\ntime at Imperial, and are\nbased on the delivery of\noverall outcomes, rather\nthan being payments for\nspecific contact hours.\nThrough our mitigation\nplans, we are aiming to\nensure the impact of the\nstrike on these outcomes\nis kept to a minimum.\u201d\nSome students have\nfelt the response is insuf-ficient. One postgraduate\nstudent told Felix: \" We\neducation suffered\".\nIn a statement released\non social media earlier\nthis week, Alex Chippy\nCompton, President of Imperial College Union, and\nLuke McCrone, President\nof the Graduate Students\u2019\nUnion, said the response\nfrom senior management\nwas \u201cunsatisfactory, and\nfailed to address many\nstudents\u2019 concerns.\u201d They\ncalled on students to\ncontinue to pressure the\nCollege for refunds on\nany teaching missed and\nnot rescheduled.\nSpeaking to Felix,\nCompton said \u201cWe\u2019re\nglad to see that collective\naction by UCU members\nhas resulted in fresh discussions about the future\nof their pensions. Current\nstudents will be glad to\nsee the end of the strikes\nthat interrupted their edu-cation, and future students\nare less likely to be taught\nby demoralised, precar-iously-employed aca-demics. Imperial College\nUnion will continue to\npress College to make it\nup to students who missed\nout on the education they\npaid for.\u201d\nOther universities have\nalso seen demands for\nrefunds of tuition fees.\nEarlier this week a class\naction lawsuit organised\nby law firm Asserson\npassed a legal milestone,\nwith more than 1,000\nstudents signing up. The\ngroup claim now has\nenough people to qualify\nfor a group litigation\norder. Asserson predict\nit could cost universities\nmillions in compensation.\nShimon Goldwater, a\nsenior solicitor at Asserson, told Times Higher\nEducation: \u201cNo other\nservice provider would\nget away with charging\nfor 25 weeks of a service\nand cutting that to 22 with\nno price reduction.\u201d\nStudents and staff on the march last term // Ansh Bhatnagar\n\u201cThe Union\nsaid the\nCollege's\nresponse\n'failed to\naddress many\nstudents'\nconcerns'\u201d\nvalue our education and\nthe interaction we have\nwith our lecturers highly.\nTo be told that 14 days\nof strike has not had an\nimpact on the outcomes\nof our degrees makes\nme sad and angry.

This being\nsaid, you are all probably thinking of one of\nthe best-known flagship\nspecies: the giant panda.\nBy focusing on such\na species and working\ntowards its conservation,\nthe status of other species\nwithin the same habitat,\nor species exposed to\nsimilar levels of threats,\nmay also benefit.\nThat all sounds well\nand good, but there are a\nfew issues: one thing you\nmay have already realised\nis that flagship species\nare disproportionately\nis a plain brown snail, or\nan extremely rare plant\nspecies \u2013 a dilemma most\nlikely playing out on the\nisland of Hawaii.\nThis is because drabber\nand relatively boring\nspeciesareunlikelytograb\nthe attention of potential\ndonors, despite the fact\nthat they may need just\nas much protection as, for\nexample, elephants. Some\nmodern conservation\norganisations have exercised different approaches\nto rectify this bias seen\ntowards large mammals\nby looking at endangered\nspecies in a new light.\nExamples of these include\nthe EDGE project, run by\nthe Zoological Society of\nLondon, and Hotspots,\nrun by Conservation International.\nEDGE aims to conserve\none-of\u2013a-kind species\nthat are facing extinction,\nand have scored different\ngroups of the world\u2019s\nanimals on how evolutionarily distinct and globally\nendangered they currently\nare. Similarly, Hotspots\nis a scheme that takes a\nmore landscape-based\napproach, raising both\nawareness and funds\nfor regions of the world\nidentified to have more\nendemic species also\nunder the threat of dis-appearing. Both of these\nschemes are moving away\nfrom the flagship species\nconcept as we have known\nit, and trying to use the\nlimited funds available\nmore effectively.\nThe emphasis on a particular species may be detrimental in the long run,\nas the public look past the\nthreats and impacts affecting certain habitats. It is\nvitally important that edu-cation, action, and policy\nextend past the flagship\nspecies to less attractive\nspecies and prevent this\npublic complacency from\nforming. 21st\ncentury\nconservation needs to\nmove forward, away\nfrom flagship species,\nand take a more holistic\napproach.\nPandas may be cute, but we can\u2019t forget about other\nanimals // Wikimedia\n\u201cFlagship\nspecies are\nskewed toward\nanimals\nconsidered\ncharismatic\u201d\nskewed towards animals\nthat are relatively large\nand considered to be\ncharismatic.

Based on observing\nclinical conditions where\nmovement is restricted\nor limited, scientists\npostulate that movement\nand mechanical forces\nare required for joint\ndevelopment and maintenance in adults. However,\nlittle is known about the\nmolecular details of how\nthis works. This group\nin Dublin is the first to\nidentify key pathways\ninvolved in the mechano-sensing aspect of joint\ndevelopment.\nThese findings do\nnot just concern expecting parents or science\nenthusiasts. With an\nageing population and an\never-increasing number\nof individuals suffering\nfrom joint diseases,\nregenerative medicine\noffers an attractive option\nto treat joint problems. By\nidentifying key molecular\ndevelopmental cues, we\ncould be a step closer to\nbringing this technology\nto the clinic.\nRegenerative medicine,\nnamely the use of stem\ncells, is used to regenerate or repair damaged\ntissues. Following cell\ndevelopment, they turn\ninto a specific cell type,\nfor example cartilage.\nScientists have been able\nto do just this by mimicking the natural process of\ndevelopment.\nDuring development,\nthe embryo matures and\nundergoes a process\ncalled differentiation,\nmeaning the cells become\nspecialised into different\ntypes, which carry out a\nparticular function. In the\nprocess of differentiation\n\u2013 whether it is during\ndevelopment or in the lab\n\u2013 cells require precise and\naccurate communication\nwith each other. Imagine\nthe game of Telephone,\nwhere the objective of\nthe game is to pass a\nmessage along the entire\ngroup without distorting\nit. As a child, the final\nstatements are often\nhilariously divergent due\nto the accumulation of\nerrors. However, if this\nhappens to differentiating\ncells, a deformed body\ncan result. Comparatively, cells perform much\nbetter than us, as multiple\ncomplex communication\nsystems are used to ensure\nthe right cell receives the\nright message.\nHumans use words and\nis important. In previous\nresearch, mouse and chick\nembryos that had their\nmovement restricted had\nan abnormal distribution\nof cartilage cells across\nthe joint region. With\nthis new research, the\nmolecular pathway that\nresponded to this mechanical stress has now been\nidentified.\nBy studying gene\nexpression profiles of\nanimals that were im-mobilised in the embryo\nduring the developmental\nstage, a few molecular\npathways \u2013 namely the canonical Wnt and BMP signalling \u2013 were highlighted\nto be instrumental. In\nparticular, the regulation\nof these pathways modulates expression of genes\nthat allow cells to sense\nthe mechanical stimuli\naround them, and/or drive\ndifferentiation to a cartilage lineage. For instance,\nSmurf1 is shown to create\na permissive environment\nfor appropriate cartilage\ndifferentiation. Furthermore, genetic knockout\nstudies have shown the\nactivation of canonical\nWnt is essential for normal\njoint development. This\nevidence reported that\nalong with the reduction\nof Wnt signalling, the\nlack of movement causes\nthe ectopic activation\nof BMP signalling via\nthe down-regulation of\nSmurf1/2, and is pivotal\nto joint development.\nWhile the study was\nconducted on chickens\nand mice, it is likely\nthat this mechanism is\nevolutionarily conserved\nacross vertebrates. Consequently, there is a high\nprobability that such\nfindings are applicable to\nhumans, both in terms of\nunderstanding congenital\ndefects and developing\nregenerative therapies for\njoint diseases.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\n\u201cWhy do\nfoetuses move\nso much?

When Carrie\nFisher passed away just\nover a year ago, social\nmedia was filled with\npeople mourning her\ndeath. Two days before,\nhowever, on Christmas\nDay 2016, Vera Rubin\nquietly passed away in\nthe USA. Rubin may not\nhave travelled through the\ngalaxy in the same way as\nthe Jedi Princess, but her\nimpact on our understanding of the stars has been\nprofound.\nIn the 1970s, Rubin and\nher colleague Kent Ford\nat the Carnegie Institution\nof Washington used an\nimage tube spectrograph\nto observe the stars of\nthe Andromeda Galaxy.\nThey expected to see the\nstars on the outer edge\nof the galaxy moving\nslower rate than the stars\nin the centre, as would be\npredicted by our known\nlaws of physics: think of\na siphon, or the planets\nsurrounding the sun in\nour solar system. Instead,\nthey found the outer stars\nwere in fact moving at\nthe same rate as the stars\nin the centre: a much\nfaster rate than expected.\nThis soon became known\nas the \u201cgalaxy rotation\nproblem\u201d. There were a\nfew theories as to why\nthis might have been the\ncase, ranging from outer\nstars having different light\nabsorption properties, to\ndifferent orbital dynamics\nunexplained by the current\nmathematical equations.\nBut gradually, scientists\nstarted developing a\ntheory that seemed to fit:\nthe presence of an invisible matter surrounding the\ngalaxy \u2013 dark matter.\nInitial thoughts were\nthat these might be\nanomalies found in just\none or two galaxies. But,\nas Rubin carried on her\ninvestigations, she found\nthat this phenomenon\nwas widespread. She\nbegan plotting the galactic\nrotation curves of a large\nnumber of galaxies, as\nwell as collecting data\non the orbital velocities\nof stars from the galaxy\ncentres to their outer\nedges. Her findings\nshowed clearly that the\nunexplained speed of the\nouter stars was typical\nof most galaxies in the\nuniverse. The dark matter\nhypothesis seemed to\nexplain these findings\n\u2013 Rubin had indirectly\nfound the first observational evidence for dark\nmatter, an invisible matter\nfound throughout our\nuniverse, which does not\ninteract with light or our\nknown electromagnetic\nspectrum.\nDark matter is currently thought to make up\nsomewhere around 84%\nof the total matter in the\nuniverse. However, our\nknowledge is limited\non what dark matter is,\nthe type of particles it\nis comprised of, and its\nrelationship with dark\nenergy (also now thought\nto constitute much of\nthe universe). Increasing\nevidence for dark matter\nis building upon Rubin\u2019s\ndiscoveries, such as the\nlight distortion of distant\ngalaxies into arcs when\ntheir light passes through\na gravitational lens caused\nby the unseen matter.\nVera Rubin made her\ncareer in astronomy at a\ntime when gender discrimination was rife. In 1948,\nshe was turned down from\na graduate programme\nat Princeton University\nbased on her gender, and\nmany believe she was\nunfairly not awarded the\nNobel Prize for her work\ndue to sexism. Despite\nthese setbacks, she went\non to become a real\ninspiration and advocate\nfor numerous women in\nphysics.\nE\n-cigarettes, often\nadvertised as an\naid for smoking\ncessation, may\nactually encourage young\nadults to take up smoking,\nnew research suggests.\nE-cigarettes are\ngrowing in popularity,\nboth in the US and\nUK, with vaping shops\nopening on every other\nstreet corner. E-cigarettes\nprovide the same smoking\nexperience as traditional\ncigarettes, but with fewer\ntoxins. First introduced\nin the US in 2007, it was\nhoped they would help\nmany of the country\u2019s\n40 million smokers\nquit. However, they\nhave become clouded in\ncontroversy, as scientists\nhaven\u2019t been able to determine their benefits and\ndrawbacks when used on\na large scale.\nThe new research,\nconducted by the Norris\nCotton Cancer Centre in\nAmerica\u2019s Dartmouth\nUniversity, alongside\nmany other partners,\nuses the most up-to-date\nevidence to quantify the\nscientific grounding of the\nbenefits and drawbacks of\nlarge scale e-cigarette use.\nThe scientists found\nthat, based on 2014\ndata, e-cigarettes did\nmore harm than good\non the whole population\nlevel. Dr. Samir Soneji,\nthe study\u2019s principal\ninvestigator from the\nDartmouth Institute for\nHealth Policy and Clinical\nPractice said: \u201cAlthough\nthe tobacco industry\nmarkets e-cigarettes as a\ntool to help adult smokers\nquit smoking [they] only\nmarginally increase the\nnumber of adult cigarette\nsmokers who are able\nto successfully quit\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cE-cigarettes\nmay facilitate cigarette\nsmoking initiation and\nconfer substantial harm\nto adolescents and young\nadults once they are introduced to nicotine.\u201d\nResearchers used\ncensus counts, national\nhealth tobacco-use\nsurveys, and published literature to create a model\nestimating the number of\nyears of life expectancy\nlost by adolescents who\nhad never smoked, and\nwho used e-cigarettes\nbefore eventually\nbecoming daily cigarette\nsmokers by the age of\naround 35-39. The scientists specifically compared\nthe additional number of\npeople who quit thanks\nto e-cigarettes against\nthose who quit without,\nwith successful quitting\ndefined as constant abstinence for seven years.\nThe current 2014 data\nshow that 3,490,000\ncurrent smokers used\ne-cigarettes to quit, whilst\n3,640,000 young adults\nstarted using e-cigarettes\ndespite previously not\nsmoking. The model estimated that, in 2015, an additional 2,070 individuals\nwould quit smoking using\ne-cigarettes compared\nto those who did not use\nthem. In contrast, it predicted that 168,000 young\nadults who did not smoke\nin 2014 would begin\nsmoking by the next year,\neventually becoming full-time smokers by the age of\n35 compared to those who\nnever used e-cigarettes.\nAlarmingly, the model\nalso estimated that e-ciga-rette usage in 2014 caused\nabout 1.5 million years\nof life to be lost by adolescents who had never\nbefore smoked.\nThe researchers warn\nthat more needs to be\ndone on a national and\nlocal scale to make e-cig-arette beneficial on the\nlarge scale. Soneji argued:\n\u201cE-cigarettes will likely\ncause more public health\nharm\u2026unless ways can\nbe found to substantially\ndecrease the number of\nadolescents and young\nadults who vape and\nincrease the number of\nsmokers who use e-ciga-rettes to successfully quit\nsmoking\u201d\nVape Nation! // Flickr/SmokeTastic\nVera Rubin with fellow scientists (second from left) // Wikimedia\n\n"
