When\nAndy Love, Labour candidate for\nEdmington, complained about\nminor differences between Labour\nspeakers being exploited, he was\nquite surprised to learn that the two\nquotes actually came from Neil\nKinnock.

A cast of 14\nengage in some flawless acting\ncomplementing a detailed and well-written script. The majority of the\n... inaction occurs in the decaying\noffice of an east-end-mini cab firm\n'Can-do-Cars'. The pathetic\ntelephone controllers, Nora, a stunning performance from Kate\n(Company, Only Fools and Horses,\nSmith and Jones) Williams, works\nan eighteen hour day, 'for life's little luxuries' and presides over the\ndrivers. Her motley crew comprises\nof ex-convicts, tranquil is er addicts,\npot-smokers, alcoholics and at the\nhelm, their boss, the white-socked,\nportable phoned, east-end wide-boy, Lol (Glyn Grimstead).\nCustomers come in all shapes and\nsizes, most notably the menacing\ncold-flashing crook Boy Boy (Louis\nHellis). A bouy ant script and\nimpeccable performances manage\nto distract from the lack of plot until\nthe unlikely, unfunny ending. This,\nhowever, fails to mar an enjoyable,\nthought-provoking evening worth\nattending for the throw-away one\nliners delivered with verve and\npanache by an accomplished\ncompany.\nCookie Monster.\n\u2022 Theatre Royal Stratford East,\nGerry Raffles Square, Stratford\nEast E15. 081-534 0310. Stratford\ntube/BR. Monday-Saturday, 8pm, \u00a33-\u00a312, \u00a32 cones (ends April 4).\nThe Gate Theatre goes Beyond\nEurope this season. The first in this\nseries of contemporary plays from\nquite a long way away is the\nCanadian Crack-walker by Judith\nThompson, to be followed by a Nigerian and Argentinian play in\nApril and May.\nCrackwalker takes a look at the\nlifestyles of the urban underclass of\nKingstown. Therese lives on\ndoughnuts and doesn't like to be\ncalled a retard, so her friends avoid\nthat phrase. Alan is her boyfriend,\nand later, husband. He hears voices\nin his head. Sandy and Joe are their\nfriends. They are 'normal'. Joe\nbeats up Sandy, who beats up Joe.\nThen there is an Indian hanging\naround, who is friends with no one.\nHe is always drunk or high and\nhates all blacks and Indians.\nThere are some great scenes in\nthis, like when Alan proposes to\nTherese (in a doughnut shop, where\nelse?). He had never known a girl\nlike her, always laughing...'But\nsometimes I cry'.\u2014'Yes, but you\ncry just like you laugh.'\nThe acting was quite good,\nalthough I thought Sandy was a bit\ntoo stylish and actors are always\nlazy with accents. (You can't exaggerate an American accent.)\nStill, Kathy Burke as Therese\nalone would make the show\nworthwhile. Also the way they\nmake us of their little room is\namazing.\nBoris.\n\u2022 Crackwalker will run until\nApril 4 at Gates Theatre, 11\nPembrdige Road, Notting Hill.\nTickets \u00a3 7 from Box Office on\n071-229 0706.\n**Coming Soon** Due to the Easter break looming,\nand no Felix for ages -1 thought I'd cheer up your revision blues by\ncommenting on the plethora of films\n- either too late to be in this issue\nor on general release over Easter.\nTop of the 'let me see' list is\nprobably 'Bugsy', just missing this\nissue, opening in the West End on\n20th March. With such a strong\ncast, led by Warren Beatty - this\nfilm should have no problem pulling\nin the crowds - it's meant to be\npretty hot stuff too, well the Gerbil\ndidn't slag it off anyway.\nShining through, starring Melanie\nGriffith and Michael Douglas,\nchronicles the daring adventure of\na Brooklyn born secretary, who\nputs her life on the line for her\ncountry etc,etc, all set against the\nsweeping tapestry of the second\nworld war. Opens on the 20th March.\nProvisionally set for release on\n27th March is the long awaited\n'Freejack', a rivetting sci-fi thriller\nso I'm told, which tells the story of\na young race car driver who\nmiraculously escapes death in a crash, only to awaken in the year\n2009 running for his life. Starring\nEmilio Estevez, Anthony Hopkins\nand, would you believe, Mick\nJagger!\nAlso on the 'meant to be good'\nlist is 'Deceived' starring Goldie\nHawn - and it's not a pseudo\ncomedy! A psychological thriller\nwith.deceiving aplenty - probably.\nOpens in the first week of April.\nOther Big name movies hitting\nthese shores soon are 'Rush', who's actors names escape me, 'My Own\nPrivate Idaho' -Keanu Reeves,\n'Medicine Man' -Sean Connery,\nand of course 'Biggies' like 'Cape\nFear' and 'Hook' and the excellent\n'The Doctor' Well I think that's most of them, there are a couple\nmore which the Big Bronze Bap\nsays to avoid, nevertheless there\nshould be enough here to keep you\nhappy. Have a great Easter, forget\nrevision for one night and take an\nold friend out to see a film. See you\nin the Summer. Oh before I go, I must give a thousand thanks to\nCatherine and Boris for their\npriceless help this term -Thankyou.\nMario D 'Onofrio (Reviews\nEditor)\nApology\n\u2022 Apologies must go to 'The\nVincent Van Gogh Foundation,\nVincent Van Gogh Museum,\nAmsterdam' for not having given\nthem for our photo of 'A Pair of\nBoots' last issue - May the fleas of\na thousand camels infest my\narmpits.\n\u201421 \u2014\n\n"

However, the Chairman of\nthe Junior Doctors' Committee of\nthe British Medical Association\ncondemned the proposals on IC\nRadio as not going far enough. Dr.\nEdwin Borman said that what was\nneeded was a restructuring of the\nnature of the work. 'Currently what\nhappens is that house officers are\nspending a considerable part of their\nday running around the wards doing\nthings for which they are grossly\noverqualified, filling in forms,\nfiling away results, taking routine\nbloods, doing routing ECGs.\nMedical students are doctors in\nDefence Minister Tom King employs Mafia to accompany him during\nImperial College's Arts Week.\ntraining, and as such they should be\ndoing the sort of work that doctors\nshould be doing, so what we're\nlooking for is one year in which\nthey would be doing the sort of\nthings which would actually be\npreparing them for being doctors,\nnot for being ward clerks, or\nporters, or ECG technicians. We\nwant to see this year run properly,\nand I'm afraid we haven't seen the\nproposals coming from Professor\nRichards yet.'\nYet, for the finest example of\nbickering, we return to the South\nKensington campus. IC Radio\nreported on 6th March, 'Gervaise\nLoraine, better known as Jarv, has\nwon the position of assistant bar\nmanager after Ramesh Patel\nresigned his post earlier this year.\nMr. Loraine was appointed above\n70 other people after the post was\nadvertised in the national media.\nThis now leaves the post of bar\nsteward wide open, and the cost of\nadvertising another post in the union\nbar has yet to be mentioned by\nsabbaticals, one of whom said,\n'Jarv was by far and away the best\ncandidate for the post. This claim\nhas been rejected widely by students\nand staff in the students' union, who\nappear to be upset that Mr. Loraine\nhad been appointed.

And then it\nwas over, or so it seemed. After one\nhour of pain, rejection and despair,\nMargo was saying 'Well it's been\nreally cool...'. But then they\nreturned for another % of an hour\nand two encores. Included, this time\nwere the much requested Misguided\nAngel with its almost disastrous\nending and the most ambitious\ncover of all time\u2014The Velvet's Sweet Jane. This time re-covered in\nthe original Lou Reed disjointed\nstyle. Then they were gone. Margo\nwrapped herself in a shawl, waved\nand wandered off after the rest of\nthe band. Who needs volume\nanyway?\nJon Jordan.\nFrom the balcony in the Albert\nHall, we could just about see the\nwaif-like figure that was Margo\nTimms, the Junkie's vocalist. But\nwhen the band picked up, there was\nno doubt who was controlling the\nshow. A voice like that is more than\nspine chilling, becoming ghostly in\nits power to transfix. Equally eerie\nwas the subject matter of the songs.\nWhilst always ethereal, there was\nalso a hint of reality that let you\nknow the Junkies had been there\nthemselves. No Rhinestone allowed\nhere.\nThe set was interspersed by\nstories about touring, playing dice,\ndedications to family; even one for\nthe balcony 'Thank you for coming\ntonight, we didn't think we'd fill it'.\nTo choose 'Cause Cheap is how J feel was slightly mocking though.\n\u201424\u2014\n\n"

The\nreason the man was recognised was\nbecause he was sacked from the\nSchool last October for a similar\noperation.\nThe security epidemic is in\ndanger of making Felix look like a Metropolitan Police charge sheet.\nOn January 17, over 20 thefts since\nthe start of the year had been\nreported. Stolen items included\nwallets, cash, cheque books, two\nfax machines, a stereo hi-fi system,\ncompact disc player, miniature\ntelevision, mountain bike, his and\nher towel set, 24 piece dinner set,\ncuddly toy.

The\n'Neighbourhood Watch' award this\nterm goes to IC DramSoc, for their\ncareful policing of what was written\nabout them.

She then challenged\nanyone who thought her actions\nwould affect her position as Union\nPresident to table a motion of no\nconfidence at the EG M scheduled\nfor two days hence.

Dear Adam.\nThis letter is essentially one of\napology; both to a specific\nindividual, and to anyone offended\nby the last issue of Broadsheet. In\nthat issue, the word, 'nigger bas her' was printed in an article, in relation\nto the aforementioned individual.\nThe use of the word was an 'in-joke' related to an entirely innocent\nincident that occurred on an RCS\nRag Tour two years ago.\nRegrettably, to anyone who is not\nfamiliar with the joke (i.e. practically everyone), it would\nseem that the person was being\nglorified for his prowess in beating\nup racial minorities. This has\nalready resulted in a threat of\nviolence towards him. averted only\nby careful explanation. I would like\nto apologise to him for this and any\nunjustified damage to his reputation\nthis may have caused. I also\napologise to anyone who was quite\nrightly offended or disturbed by\nwhat they considered a racist\ncomment in print.\nUpon reading the last issue of\nFelix, I was greeted with a cartoon\nthat depicted me as a drunk, racist\nyo b. This was quite interesting\ncoming from someone who doesn't even know me personally. I may be\na generally unpleasant person, but\nI am none of these things (not to my\nknowledge, anyway). However, the\nartist was entirely within their rights\nto criticise, and apart from the\nlibellous nature of it, the cartoon\ncontained valid points. When I edited the article in question, I failed to remove the offending\nword. Perhaps a more competent\neditor would not have overlooked\nthis.\nOn the whole, I would rather be\nincompetent than racist.\nYours.\nDavid Coddard,\nBroadsheet Editor 91-92.\nP.S. Although this letter is\nactually a sincere apology, I imagine that there are a number of\nzealots who will not be happy unless\nI am thrown out of college for some\nperceived lack of Political\nCorrectness.\nDodgy Videos\nDear Adam,\nThis is only a short letter but I feel I must follow up on Jon\nJordan's letter in Felix 929. Whilst\nI agree that '...such thinking can\nnever solve man's problems', my\naim is not to discuss the (in)validity\nof the good concept but to put him\nright on his last comment on\nHumanism. Humanists most\ndefinitely do not lack moral values.\nReligions do not have a monopoly\non morals. Morals from religion are\noften, at best, riddled with\ninconsistencies and could even be\ncalled perverted in some cases.\nWould anyone here agree that it is\nmoral to sentence an author to death\nfor exercising his right to free\nspeech?\nWhat humanists seek is to base\ntheir morals on rational grounds as\nopposed to the interpretation of\n'Holy Scriptures'.\nAs regards '...dod gy videos',\nwell, to each his own I suppose.\nCertainly selling such videos is not\na tenet of Humanism.\nG Maskail, Physics 2.\nBailey on the Fox\nDear Adam,\nIt is some time since I have\nwritten to you, but I felt I must write\non the issue of fox hunting. Before\nand since Kevin McNamara's bill\nwas thrown out in parliament, a hell\nof a lot of nonsense has been written\nand spoken on this subject. Being\na landowner the only foxes I know\nare those that rip open black rubbish\nbags that inefficient councils\ndustman leave behind.\nFoxes are vermin. No better than\nrats. I sometimes fell that I couldn't give a toss whether they are ripped\napart by dogs, killed humanely or\ngunned down by the SAS provided\nthat they do kill them. If they took\na few domestic dogs with them who\ncrap all over the pavement, all the\nbetter. However I wonder how\nmany of these people would\ncriticise fox hunting if it was the\npast time of ethnic minorities and\nnot a British tradition. They'd probably be the very same people\nwho'd attack critics for being racist!\nI must admit that I do find killing\nanimals solely for sport distasteful.\nI wonder what goes through the\nminds of these silly people in stupid\nred coats. There to ffs gather\ntogether, have a couple of sherries\nand have a 'jolly' good time. I bet\nyou would find a large number of\nthem wearing the same school tie!\nHowever you can 'understand' why\nthey do this.

There in, lies\nthe problem, since it is usually the\ncurrent re-apps 'best friends' who\nare picked.\nOK these people may be\n'popular', but the point is that there\nUnion\nStuff\nWell, hopefully elections are over,\ndepending upon how the U GM went yesterday.

It does\nnothing to control numbers. In fact\nthe Isle of Wight did not have a fox\nproblem until foxes were introduced\nfor the sole purpose of hunting.\nWhy don't they just admit they love\nchasing things and killing them?\nWhy don't they just tell the\nanti hunting lobby to sod off?\nI'm often criticised for being too\ninflexible but I have come up with\na solution to this problem. Under\nmy system fox hunting would be\nhave been candidates in the past,\nthat were just friends with the re-apps and no one else. They were\nalso very irresponsible, having had\nseveral warnings from the wardens\nover the year. But these people\nwere chosen and became re-apps\nbecause they were 'popular' as far\nas the re-apps were concerned.\nPopular people are not always the\nbest people for the job.

Not only is water vapour\nspread throughout the lower\natmosphere but there are also,\neffectively, inexhaustible reservoirs\nof the stuff i ock ed up' in oceans\nand polar ice-caps. It is the fact that\nthe temperature on this planet is\nsuch that water can exist as solid,\nliquid, and all-important vapour,\nwhich means that this temperature\n(and life as we know it) can be\nsustained. Would be philosophers\ncan make of this what they please.\nEven though it is pipped for the\nplace of chief greenhouse gas, by\nwater vapour, the effect of C02\ncertainly cannot be neglected. C02\nis a strong absorber of long-wave\nradiation. There is no dispute that\nmankind has been pumping\nThis is\nill-informed\n'eco babble' THE UNCERTAINTIES:\nTHE AIR...\nWater vapour is, as I said, a 'greenhouse gas' and so is partially\nresponsible for warming the lower\natmosphere. Yet paradoxically, it is\na cosmic fluke that, on Earth, water\ncan also exist as a solid and liquid\nwhich helps keep the temperature\nstable.\nAir cools as it moves up through\nthe atmosphere, and the water\nvapour within it condenses out to\nform clouds.\nAt the simplest level, clouds can\nreflect the shortwave radiation from\nthe Sun back into space, stopping\nit ever reaching and warming the\nThe properties of clouds are also\naffected by industrial activity. It is\na peculiarity of the atmosphere that\nclouds will form more readily in\n'dirty' polluted air. This is simply\nbecause the water droplets need\nsomething to form round as they\ngrow, and in polluted air there is a large supply of convenient, floating,\nmuck.\nMankind produces a large\namount of this dirt in the form of\nsulphur compounds which, like\nC02, come from the burning of\nfossil fuels. Unlike C02, however,\nthe sulphur compounds act to cool\nthe planet by changing the way the\nclouds absorb and reflect radiation.\nresearch. The uncertainty is such\nthat most researchers split the\ngreenhouse effect into a clear-sky\neffect, about which they are fairly\nunanimous, and a cloudy-sky effect,\nwhere they cannot always agree on\nthe sign, let alone the magnitude,\nof any temperature change.\n...THE PLANET...\nThe oceans can also greatly affect\nthe climate. The atmosphere and\nocean are not independent but\nlinked. It is impossible to describe\none without considering the other.\nAsk an oceanographer why the\nflow in the Atlantic is as it is, and\nthey will reply that it depends on the\ndistribution of the wind. Ask a meteorologist why we see these\nwinds, and you will be told that it\nis intimately related to the surface\ntemperature of the ocean. It is only\nrecently that attempts have been\nmade to describe the atmosphere\nand ocean as a single system.\nIt has long been known that water\nis far more effective than air at\nstoring and transporting heat. A large fraction of the energy\ntransported, some say as high as\n50%, around the planet is\nLike driving\nwith the\naccelerator\ndown and the\nbrakes on.\nsignificant amounts of the gas into\nthe atmosphere continuously for\nwell over a century. It can be\nargued, with a horrible plausibility,\nthat this must lead to the trapping\nof more and more of the outgoing\nradiation and an inevitable increase\nin the surface temperature.\nIt is not just C02. In recent years,\neven more potent greenhouse gases\nhave been introduced, including the\nultimate chemical bad guys, the\n'ozone-guzzling' Chloro-FluoroCarbons (CFCs). According to the\nsimple theory, this can only make\nmatters worse.\nThe simple theory seems\ndamning, and if it were all that\nmattered, global warming would be\nunderstood. This is far from the\ntruth. The simple theory is based on\nthe idea of a balance between the\nradiation absorbed by the\natmosphere and the energy supplied\nby the sun. It neglects the fact that\nthe atmosphere is constantly\nmoving, transporting heat, water\nvapour and other gases up and down\nand across the surface of the globe.\nsurface. Nothing is ever that simple:\nclouds can also emit outgoing longwave radiation back down, trapping\nheat. That is why a cloudy winter\nnight is generally warmer than a clear one.\nWhether clouds warm or cool\ndepends on more than just the time\nof day. The height and thickness of\nthe cloud, its temperature, whether\nit is made of liquid water or ice, and\nthe size of the droplets making it up,\nare all highly significant. Some\nrecent work from the National\nCentre for Atmospheric Research\n(NCAR) in the United States\npredicts that a small decrease in the\naverage size of cloud water droplets\nin the lower atmosphere could\ncompletely counteract the currently\npredicted greenhouse warming.\nOne expert, from the United\nKingdom Meteorological Office,\nhas described the effect of\nproducing copious amounts of both\nas rather like 'driving with the\naccelerator full down and the brakes\non at the same time'.\nIt is worth mentioning that one of\nthe few ecological measures agreed\nupon, by the majority of\nindustrialised countries, is a reduction in the sulphur emissions\nwhich are known to be responsible\nfor acid rain. To continue the\nmotoring metaphor, this is akin to\nreleasing the brake. It is ironic that\nin reducing one environmental\nproblem, we could easily be\nworsening another.\nThe study of the effects of cloud\nis a relatively new branch of climate\ntransported by the oceans. Yet the\nstudy of the ocean has always\nlagged behind that of the\natmosphere.\nThis was partly a practical\nproblem; the atmosphere is easier\nto study than the ocean simply\nbecause you cannot breath the\nocean. But there is also the matter\nof priority. People, from farmers to\nfighter pilots, need to know what\nthe weather is going to do\ntomorrow. It had always been\nassumed that, as the basic patterns\nof ocean temperature and\ncirculation vary comparatively little\nfrom day to day, the small changes\nwhich do occur have little impact\non the atmosphere. In the short\nterm, this is largely true. In the\nlonger term, when studying not the\nweather but the climate, these slow\nvariations can make all the\ndifference.\nThe work which has been done\nhas revealed that the movement of\nwater throughout the oceans is\nevery bit as complicated as the\nmovement of air in the atmosphere.\n\u201427\u2014\n\n"

The only thing\nmissing is true compassion for the\npatients in his care. But Jack sees\nthings from a very different light\nwhen he is diagnosed as having\ncancer of the Larynx.\nAs the difference between merely\ntreating a patient and caring for\nthem become clear to Jack, he\nmeets a young woman named June\n(Elizabeth Perkins\u2014Big, He Said,\nShe Said)\u2014a patient he meets while\nattending radiotherapy, whose\nuncommon strength and spirit\nbecomes the catalyst for his own\nrecovery and the understanding that\na healer must first know about heart\nbefore operating on one.\nThe film is based on the book 'A taste of my own medicine' by Dr\nEd Rosenbaum, a successful\nphysician who was diagnosed as\nhaving cancer.\nIt is a very moving film,\nheartwarming to see an ignorant\nman going through such change,\nand touching that someone like\nJune\u2014whose brain tumour was\nfound too late to save her, someone\nin a worse position, can have so\nmuch more strength and\nunderstanding, and many more of\nthe qualities that make us human.\nThere are even those moments of\ninane humour, like the singing of\n'Big Girls Don't Cry' around the\noperating table, or when Dr\nMacKee, instead of taking his\nstudents round the wards, gets them\nto put on gowns and be patients\nprescribed illnesses for seventy odd\nhours!\nThe Doctor doesn't open in the\nWest End until the first week in\napril, but I'm told you can send\naway for tickets in the Radio Times.\nTry not to miss this film, it may be\na tearjerker, and if you are not\ncompassionate you will hate it, but\nit does strike some truths, which\nhopefully it won't take us all\nsituations like this to realise.\nPOO\nFried Green Tomatoes Cabal and Love\nWandering around the underground\nyou'd be forgiven for thinking this\nfilm was going to be a monster hit,\n(what with posters that size), it\nisn't, but it certainly isn't poo\neither, a bit of a weird one this.\nWhat we are getting for our\nmoney is really a story within a story. In the present day Evelyn\nCouch (Kathy Bates), an\noverweight woman in her early\nforties is in a rut. Her husband's aunt, bedridden in a nursing home,\nthrows blunt objects at her. Her\nonly friend is a newly met resident\nof the nursing home, feisty\noctogenarian, Ninny Threadgoode\n(Jessica Tandy), who enthrals\nEvelyn with tales from her home of\nWhistle Stop, Alabama. This is\nwhere the story within a story bit\ncomes in: Fifty years back, Ninny\nrecalls, Idgie Threadgoode (Mary\nStuart Masterson) ran the Whistle\nStop cafe (fried green tomatoes a speciality). The story is quite long,\nstarting with Idgie's troubled\nchildhood, moving through her\nfinding a much needed friend in the\nform of Ruth (Mary Louise Parker),\na demure, good-hearted young\nwoman who suffers one tragedy\nafter another.\nThese stories - which Ninny\nrelates to Evelyn in her visits the\nnursing home - provoke Evelynshe starts taking control of her life\nwith often amusing consequences.\nLike the best of tales, 'Fried\nGreen Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop\nCafe' connects with experiences we\nall share; wedding and funerals,\nrecreation and retribution, morals,\nmemorable meals and of course, the\noccasional murder. The main thing\nI hold against this film is that it's a tad too long, but where it succeeds\nis in the lack of bit tines s evident in\n'multiple' story films, and its wry\nsense of humour. It's another one\nof those not for the non-compassionate sI'm afraid, but it is\nextremely well put together, oh, the\nmusic is ace.\nPOO\nHaving sat down in the audience,\nyou're thrown back in time: 1784,\na principality in Germany.\nIt takes time to get used to the\nsetting of the 18th century, but then\nyou get gripped by the intrigue of\nsatire, class-borders dividing\nlovers, despotism and rebellion.\nThe conflict of lovers divided by\nsociety, the questioning of the social\nsystem and the doctrine of divine\nrights combined with a revolutionary spirit are typical\nfeatures of the 'Storm and Stress'\nera, when young poets like Schiller\nsupported the 'new' ideas of\nparliament aris m, human rights,\nfreedom of spirit and 'creating\ngenius'.\nTheatre Manoevres provides you\nwith basic background info in their\nprogramme. The company is\nbravely promoting classical foreign\nplays, which would otherwise not\nbe seen here.

The problems are\nnot unique to this College: they are\nfound throughout London\nUniversity, are fairly common and\nsometimes severe.\nDifficulties arise because\npostgraduates are often unaware of\ntheir rights and supervisors of their\nresponsibilities\u2014there is a fine line\nbetween neglect and giving a postgraduate enough in epe nden ce to\nreach academic maturity.\nUniversity regulations, for\nexample, allow a postgraduate, with\nreasonable justifications, to change\ntheir supervisor; this can occur with\nor without the consent of the\nsupervisor. If the student's support\nis tied in some way to the\nsupervisor, as opposed to a Research Council quota award to\nthe Department, complications\nmay, of course, arise but they are\nnot insurmountable in this context.\nOne's overriding fear in this\nmatter is, however, that comments\nsuch as those of Chris Riely may be\nused as ammunition by some to\nstand yet another worthy aspect of\nacademic life on its head for no\ngood reason. There is no doubt that\nthere have been numerous preludes\nto this and postgraduate training has\nhitherto been spared only because\nof the intense focus on\nundergraduate studies. A few timely\nand intelligently applied constraints\nand adjustments are all that is really\nrequired to bring about the\nnecessary improvements. May I advise my colleagues to start by\nreading, or re-reading, 'Research\nStudent and Supervisor\u2014an\napproach to good supervisor\npractice' issued by the SERC (June, \u2022\n1989); these were once obtainable\nfrom the Registry.\nYotirs sincerely,\nA.G.

In the\nprocess Mary's created three new\nrecords; six consecutive cup\ntriumphs, a record points margin\nfor the cup final and perhaps most\nsignificantly, the most successful\nhospital of all time by overtaking\nGuy's record of thirty wins in the\ncompetition. All this in the oldest\nrugby competition in the world.\nThe match was played in a good\nspirit before a noisy, bois trou s crowd. The Mary's cheerleaders,\ntrumpeters and tango men led the\ntouch line proceedings: the parading\nof the The Puffin recently re-acquired from the Middlesex team\nand the removal of an unfortunate\nMiddlesex man's( as opposed to an\nEssex Girl's) clothes who happened\nto be caught trying to kidnap one of\nthe Mary's cheerleaders.\nPrior to the final, Mary's had\nscored thirteen tries, eleven of\nwhich were scored by a very quick\nback division, and as a result much\nwas expected. At the start Mary's kept the ball close to their forwards\nand fifteen minutes into the game\nwere already thirteen points up with\na try each for Torkington and Hunt\nand a conversion and penalty by\nButland (who had a poor game, by\nhis own high standards, with his\nplace kicking). By this stage the cup\nwas won and after Morgan had\npowered over and two further tries\nwere scored\u2014the score at half-time\nwas 27-0.\nThe first period of the second half\nsaw some UC/Middlesex pressure\nbut they never looked like breaching\nthe Mary's defence. A pushover try\nby Kelly (but claimed by the front\nrow) meant that Mary's could really\nrelax and begin to run the ball from\ninside their own twenty-two. Two\nof the moves resulted in glorious\ntries involving virtually the whole\nteam. Anyone who was fortunate\nenough to see it will not forget the\ntwo second rows rounding off a move under the posts after starting\nit by winning ball at the line out,\nnear their own try line.\nOn Wednesday (11th March), St\nMary's Hospital 2nd XV are\nplaying in the 2nd XV Hospitals\nCup against Charing Cross and are\nhopeful of victory after beating\nKings 83-0 in the semi-final.

They\nplead guilty on all counts.\nThis season, IC 2nds reached the\nsecond round of the U AU competition, the semi-final of the\nUL U cup, were placed fourth in\nDivision Oe of the UL U league, and\nhave been the top scoring men's team in the football club. These\nresults are pretty good, considering\nthat the seconds have had an\nunsettled side, having fielded 34\ndifferent players in the course of the\nseason.\nThere have been regulars, of\ncourse, and a key player for IC 2nds this year has been Steve Shilling.\nDespite his occasional loss of\nreason, he is one of the best\ngoalkeepers in the whole university.\nAs midfielders converted to full-backs, Eamon McCann, Chris\nMorris and Andy Fenton have been\nessential in the team's tactic of\nplaying from the back. Richard\nBurrows and Ian Finnerty have\nprovided solidarity in the centre of\ndefence.\nRichie Dixon, the Nigel Clough\nlookalike, accidentally acquired by\nthe side, scores spectacular goals as\neasily as he gets sweaty hands.\nOther midfielders, Captain Rakesh\nThe Boat Club this weekend\nproduced a highly impressive set of\nresults at Reading University Head.\nThe outright win over the Oxford\nUniversity blue boat and three\ncrews in the top ten underlines the\ncollege's position amongst the top\nthree university clubs in the\ncountry.\nThe 1st VIII won the whole event\nbeating Oxford by six seconds with\nonly two other crews within thirty\nseconds of their winning time.\nThe 2nd and 3rd VIII beat all\nother U AU opposition to come 8th and 9th. The men's novice VIII continued\ntheir unbeaten run with an\nimpressive row for their fourth win\nthis term.\nThe women's novice VIII came\na close third in their category.\nForthcoming events include a possible race against Cambridge at\nMuthoo, Max Duckworth and\nTellis Botzios are famous for their\nteam talks, hair gel and showers\nrespectively. Ben Adams and\nMickey Plummer played very few\ngames and their expertise was\nmissed. The youthful Stuart Miller\nalso made sporadic appearances.\nThe seconds have had a deadly\nforward line, with Jason Devoys\ncapable of turning on a sixpence and\ntop scorer Simon Barry incapable\nof smiling. However, Barry has\nscored almost twice as many goals\nthis season as the whole of the 1 st\nXI team.\nThe hallmark of this year's the Tideway Head of the river race\nin a fortnight, where 500 crews\ncompete. The men's top squad aim\nto have three crews in the top thirty\nwith the first VIII well within the\ntop ten. The novice men hope to\nrecord our third novice win in five\nyears.\nNext term the 1st VIII,\nrepresenting British universities,\nwill go to the Japanese Henley\nRegatta to defend their 1991 victory\nover other international universities.\nTop England rugby stars Roger\nUttley and Andy Ripley enlisted the\nhelp of ICBC 1st VIII members\nSteve Ellis and Ed Wild, with\nOlympic coach Bill Mason to\nattempt rowing for the first time,\nnoting that they would require a lot\nof training to complete 20 strokes,\nlet alone 20 minutes of gruelling\nhead race...\nsecond team has been its positive\nstyle, playing some beautiful\npossession football and placing an\nemphasis on teamwork.

Incubating\nlaboratories have been given the\nsecret codename 'the bathrooms',\nand disguised with ordinary\nbathroom fittings.\nWater appears to be a key factor\nin the process.

She added mysteriously\n'but why are you asking me love,\nI'm only the cleaner.'

They are then\nsubjected to cruel demands for\nmoney referred to by scientists as\n'rent'. Once infected few students\nresist payment, deluded into\nbelieving that they face a long,\nslow, painful death if these requests\nare challenged.\nScientists at Porton Down, the\nGovernment's biological and\nchemical weapons research unit,\nclaimed 'We don't know what the\nhell you're talking about. Try\ncalling a plumber for God's sake.'\nThe site, code name CLAY PZERO-nds or CLAY-PO nds, has\nbeen likened to the area round\nChernobyl.

    "content": "Felix Felix 931 18 March 1992\nSo the last issue of the term comes\naround again and they have given\nme a whole page... fanfare of\ntrumpets please. I have survived\nanother term without being sued for\nlibel, which really is quite a surprise\nall things considering. However,\nthis may be changed by this issue\nas some very interesting details\nhave come to light regarding some\nrather important college\nmanagement type people. As you\nwould have read in the news round\nup for this term (if you haven't read\nit you really should, Declan did a storming report and is in danger of\nbeing sued himself if you ask me),\nthe 'Who's sleeping with who in\nSherfield/Princes Gardens' award\nhas had to be dropped. Could this\nperhaps have something to do with\non and are usually so thick that they\nlet even the most confidential news\nout after only a few G&T's. How\ndo you think we found out about\nthis scandal in the first place.\nShould I name them? Have J. any\nintegrity at all? Do I want to be at\nCollege next year? 1 can honestly\nanswer yes to all three of these\nquestion but as they are a conflict\nof interests all 1 can say is Mr G and\nMs S, you got away with it this\ntime!\nWhat I can report on though is\nmy fellow Felixites. Declan Curry\ndeserves a mention, anyone who is\ncapable of spending 36 minutes in\nconference with Peter Brooke,\nsecretary of State for Northern\nIreland, is worth a mention\nespecially as I won the sweep stake\nastronomical, that they wouldn't make it to the interview due to a bomb scare on the underground\n(again) and all times lang ing from\none minute to one hour. As we\nunderstand it Declan has managed\nto wangle a job working for the\nBBC over the summer so you never\nknow we may see him standing\noutside Westminster yet!\nAnd now, the sloppy bit...\nIt was leap year this year, and it\nseems as though romance was\ndefinitely in the air for some. Simon\nGibbons (RCS VP) and Sarah\nGoodchild (Rag Treasurer) are now\npledged to be wed, but who popped\nthe question? When confronted in\nthe bar recently both of them denied\nasking the other but rumour has it\nthat it went something like the\nThe Dear Marge Column\nIn the final\narrive der ci of\nthe term, Marge\nlashes out at all\nand sundry, and\ndamn those libel\nwrits!\nthe fact that the two non-students\ninvolved are both married and one\ngained her job by somewhat\ndubious means? Or maybe it is just\nbecause Felix has gained some\njournalistic integrity over the last\nfew months and is no longer\nattempting to stir up the shit with\nthe largest wooden spoon available?\nWe could find out for defina te by\nringing Mr. G's secretary - they\nalways seem to know what's going\nheld in the office for how long he\nwould actually last in the interview\nroom, although after hearing\nDeclan's interview technique I wouldn't have been surprised if Mr\nBrooke had had to leave because of\nnervous stress. My ticket was\n35-39.59 minutes, other\npossibilities were that Declan\nwouldn't get past security, that the\ntime it would take for Declan to\nread out the first question would be\nfollowing:\nSimon: Sarah, you're looking\nworried.\nSarah: Yes. will you marry me?\nThe big question is what was she\nlooking worried about? Her\nforthcoming election campaign, the\nladder in her stockings, the time of\nher next lecture or something else?\nAnswers on a post card please to the\nFelix office; we might even be able\nto find a prize for the most\nimaginative answer. Still on the\nsubject of 29th February, Simon\nand Sarah were not the only two\nwith the ir resist able desire to do\nsomething completely b army, two\npeople got married! And they were\ndrunk at the time - exceedingly so\nas we have heard. It was the day of\nthe F KH booze cruise to France,\nthey were in France and obviously\nin love, not necessarily with each\nother, but they were in love. She\npopped the question, he said yes\n(foolish man), they found a registry\noffice and kaboom they were man\nand wife. We have had reports that\nthey were so drunk they don't remember doing it, but if you ask\nme, to be that drunk you would\nnormally have to be passed out in\na corner. Oh well, congratulations\nto Mr and Mrs Chris Collinson of\nFalmouth Keogh Hall. What I want\nto know now is - has it been\nconsummated yet, and if so how\ndoes Yasmin's long term boyfriend\nfeel about all this?\nI really have nothing more to say\nexcept to all those people out in the\nquad on Friday night / Saturday\nmorning - that was not at all discreet\nand unavoidable! (It was Marge\nherself - oh. the hypocrisy of it all\n- Ed)\nHappy Easter to everyone and for\nthose of you who do bele ive in the\nEaster Bunny, enjoy your eggs!\n-30-\n"

    "content": "18 March 1992 Felix 931 Music\nsays 'No' to fast food\nYou played the British Music\nWeekend, at Wembley Arena.\nWhat's it like playing this stage\ncompared to that one?\nF: The weird thing about playing\nWembley isn't that your playing in\nfront of thousands of people, it's that you can't really see them, that's the strangest thing.\nD: It's just like playing in a black\nhole or something.\nF: And it takes about quarter of an\nhour to walk across the stage, which\nis a bit too much like hard work to\nme. That's why we like playing\nplaces like the Borderline. I just\nstick my feet on the spot and can't go anywhere.\n8.15: The support band have started\nto check their drums in the\nbackground. Consequently things\nget a bit difficult to hear. We start\nto eat their burgers.\nYou're touring with Shakespear's Sister this month. How did you\nget onto that bill?\nF: We just phoned up their\nmanager, and suggested that we're\nthe best band to support them, and\nthey listened all the music, and\nconsequently they liked us. What\nwe liked'about them is that they're\nlike us, just a credible pop band,\nthat's just what we want to be. We\nadmire people from Massive Attack\nthrough to Talk Talk, and The\nCocteau Twins. We've never had\nanything in common with the\nshoe gazing scene or even the baggy\nscene, I mean, last year everyone\nwas staring at their shoes, and we\nhad nothing to do with it.\nIn many ways, a band can reflect\nhow your life has actually been :-In our first reviews, they said that\nI as a performer was self-,\ndestructive, and that's what I mm\nbeen accused of all my life. OnelME\nthe reasons I joined this band was\nthat for all my life,T 've never been\npart of any scene, and it seemed like\nthe only solution to this is to bu ik fa scene all around myself, and jaH j friends. That's what we want to WD is to start our own scene. AJEB\nsometime I see the way that th S band is. as if it's come to mirror!\nwhatever has gone on in my life,\nand the other people in this band's life.\nWhat's the deal between Poly dor\nand your record label, Fiction?\nV: All the control stays with\nFiction, they just did a deal with\nPolydor to gal better distribution.\na better service for the people who\nbuy his records. Creatively,\nPolydor have no influence. Fiction\nhelp us with all our decisions. I think as a band, they'd like us to be\nless commercial - when we asked-someone we really liked to remix\nour record, they said 'Maybe he's a bit well known as a remixer.' It's like the other way round to usual,\nI mean, we try and persuade them\nthat we want to do a video, and they\nsay 'Are you sure?'\nYou've just finished a tour of\nAmerica. What was that like?\nD: We spent six weeks in a van, a Dodge van, and in our last week\nthere, we were on our way to\nMinneapolis, on an 800 mile drive,\nand our van came off the road, and\nrolled five times, and destroyed all\nour equipment, and our tour\nmanager perforated his jugular, so\nwe quit then.\nF: We went to L.A. and that was\na bunch of wank. Americans didn't understand the idea of rave at all.\nTo them it was just a disco, but it\nused to mean a lot more to us, at\nleast before the marketing me got\nhold of it. A lot of our songs are\ninspired by the early rave stuff,\n'Rainbow' and 'Fountain' were\ninspired by tracks by people such\nas Marshall Jefferson and Jamie\nPrinciple, where people combined\nan emotional feel, together with a very mechanical feel. We want to\nbe a band with an emotional feel,\nlike The Smiths, but we didn't want\nto do it with jan gly guitars.\nAnd we went to Salt Lake City,\nwhere the mormons are, and the\nBook Of Mormon is everywhere.\nWe told the crowd we were going\nto do some Osmonds covers, and\nimmediately, half the crowd ran\ndown the front, and started\n. . \u2022 mg. ami hall of then; went\n\u2022 nTH Qp ck. and gai * us mis really\nf dirty look.

The Lebanese\nSociety was not suspended by the\nOSC as was reported. I would like\nto apologise to all concerned and\nhope that everyone can now let\nthe matter rest. The Lebanese\nteams have since been reinstated\nto the IC Indoor Soccer\nTournament.\nAs for the tournament itself, 5\nteams have now successfully\nqualified for the second phase, to\nbe held on Wednesday 17th March.\nThey are IC FC2, Chemical\nEngineers, Cypriots, IC FC1 and\nSikh 2. With 3 games still to be\nplayed (at the point of writing), five\nteams are contesting the remaining\n3 places: Lebanese 1, Islamic 1,\nIndian, Snooker 1 and Sikh 1.\nEach qualifying team shall be\nseeded according to the number of\npoints attained and their goal-difference. Then the team seeded 1\nwill play the team seeded 8.\nSimilarly, the remaining fixtures\nshall be Seed 2 vs Seed 7, Seed 3\nvs Seed 6 and Seed 4 vs Seed 5. The\nwinning team from each match will\ngo on to play in the semi-finals. If\nthe better seeded team wins their\nrespective games, the semi-final\nline-up shall be Seed 1 vs Seed 4\nand Seed 2 vs Seed 3. The winning\nsemi-finalists shall then contest the\nfinal.\nThe tournament champions shall\nbe presented will a shield, engraved\nminiature trophies for each player\nplus a cheque for \u00a375. The losing\nfinalist shall receive runners-up\nmedals plus a cheque for \u00a330.\nCheques for \u00a3 1 0 shall be awarded\nto the losing semi-finalists. As the\ntournament is organised by the\nOSC. there shall also be a trophy\nfor the best placed OSC team.\nIt is hoped all games shall be\nplayed on Wednesday between\n9.30-l pm. If this cannot happen,\nthen uncompleted games shall be\nplayed from 4pm onwards.

Dinner consisted of a variety\nof Malaysian delights ranging from\n'Ayam Masak Merah' to Bingka (a type of cake). This was a thrill for\nthe adventurous and a delight to\nthose who had acquired the taste\nover the years. It was indeed an\nir resist able spread of exotic food.\nContent. Guests were then herded\nto their seats int he Great Hall\nbefore the cultural show began. A brief introduction to the show by\nhosts Azwan and Ellene was\nfollowed by a dramatic opening\nceremony, which lived up to its\nexpectations as the theme for the\nevening suggested\u2014a fictitious\nflight to Malaysia, flight MH002.\nGuests were enthralled with a takeoff scene in a place, complete with\ncaptain's instructions. The evening\nthen kicked off to a brilliant start\nwith the two man band of Azmi and\nMalek pounding away on their\nkeyboards.\nThis was followed by a traditional\ndance 'Kuda Kepang', depicting\nmen on horseback which kept the\ncrowd capit va ted with their\nillustration of the spreading of Islam\nby Javanese men in the interiors of\nJava. Han M.K. was on next with\nhis item on Chinese cali graph y. Accompanied by narration and\nsoothing Chinese music, it proved\nto be a hit with the crowd. Next up\nwas the 'Wan Bulan' or the flying\ndance which is usually performed\nby the youth int he village of the\nEast Coast of Malaysia after the\nharvest. Incidentally, the 'wan' or\nkite is also the logo of the national\nairlines, Malaysia Airlines.\nThe crowd then joined in the\n'Acoustic Jam', singing and\nhumming away to familiar\nMalaysian tunes and oldies.\n'Bongai' a graceful dance presented\nby four talented young women of\nthe ICMS gave the crowd a chance\nto catch their breath while enjoying\nthis form of traditional dance called\nTnang'. The graceful 'Doongal'\ndancers then slid into the shadows\nas the pantomime began. An eerie\nperformance relating to death, the\nsoul and whatever comes next.\nMeanwhile a raffle was held in\nbetween each performance.\nThe second half of the evening\nbegan with the main item of the\nday\u2014the 'Ukle Mayang' a traditional dance which visualise d the romance between a young\nfisherman lost at sea and a mystic\nprincess. This intriguing\ndance/drama was followed by a sketch based on a typical village\nsetting and the conflicts between an\nadopted and real son. A colourful\nfashion show with a live display of\n'Batik' kept the crowd enthralled as\nthe climax of the evening drew\nnearer.\nThe grand raffle\u2014a return ticket\nto Malaysia was won by, well it is\nstill mystery\u2014the chap didn't turn\nup so his friend collected his prize\non his behalf! The two man band\nwas on again, before the entire cast\ngot up on stage to sing 'Rasa\nSayang'\u2014one of our traditional\nways of saying goodbye. A few\nverses of 'Pantun' or poems were\nalso recited, bringing messages of\nfriendship and happiness to end an\nevening which will be treasured by\nall those present.\nThe ICMS would like to extend\ngratitude to all the guests, members\nand their friends who helped make\nFlight MH002 a success. We hope\nthat you will be with us again next\nyear for another enjoyable evening.\n\n"

The only reason I bring\nup that it was the PM is because I asked myself why we elected him\nas PM, only to realise a few seconds\nlater that we didn't. The five main strategies\npoliticians use during their\nskirmishes with the media include\nthe Complete and Utter Denial, the\nRottweiler Strategy, the 7 think the\nquestion that is important is...'\nEvasion, the Furious Argument and\nthe rarely seen 'Man of the People'\ndirective.\nRemember that a politician is\nplaying to an audience, and in 'the\nDenial' the audience is assumed to\nbe plain thick, which correctly\ntargets a large percentage of the\npopulation. Example:\nInterviewer: 'Will you negotiate\nwith a third party if there is a hung\nparliament?'\nPolitician: 'Well, as we are going\nto win the next election, this\nsituation will not arise.'\nInterviewer: 'Your party has a reputation for raising taxes to fund\nthe public sector...'\nPolitician: 'No it doesn't.' Subtlety does not play a major\npart in this ploy. Next, the\nRottweiler 'Maul the Interviewer'\nAttack.\nPolitician in mid-spiel: ' and\nI say again that under no\ncircumstances will we...'\n(Interviewer makes sounds of\ngetting word in edgeways)\nPolitician: 'no, no, let me finish\nthis point, you can have your say\nwhen I 've finished you didn't interrupt Mr Bloggs of the\nopp po site party when he had his\nsay ' etcetera.\nInterviewer: 'Will your party\nincrease the funding of public\ntransport if it gets into power?'\nPolitician: 'I am shocked that you\nattempt to make political capital out\nof such tragedies as the Clapham\nRail disaster. Absolutely a palling. Two of my constituents were\nseriously wounded in that episode\n- I know because I saw them in\nhospital....'\nThis ploy is intended to make the\naudience emp a this e with the poor,\nbele a gu red politician who is only\ntrying to do his job but is being\nbrutally and maliciously attacked by\neditorial\nself-important journalists. Thirdly,\nthe Evasions.\nInterviewer: What is your\nparty's position on Scottish\ndevolution?\"\nPolitician: 'Firstly, let me make\nit quite clear that our party\nwholeheartedly supports the objects\nand ideals of European Union. I. myself, have travelled across the\nEEC to study the economic health\nof small nations ' (etc).\nInterviewer: 'Is your umbrella\nstripe y, or does it have spots?\"\nPolitician T don't think that is\nreally the issue at stake in this\ninstance, but what I do think is\nimportant is that when the right\ncircumstances arise, we will pia y our cards close to our chest, we will\ndefend the sovereign it y of these\nislands and we will not allow the\neconomy to be hijacked by\nunscrupulous quick-buck\nfly-by-nights....'\nThe reason for taking this path\ncould be that either that the\npolitician doesn't know the answer\nbut won't admit it, that the question\nis somewhat sensitive so he or she\nwon't answer it or that he or she is\ndetermined to say something on a particular subject and no jumped up\nlittle toad of a journalist is going to\nstop them. The 'Furious Argument'\ncannot be scripted. It involves two\npoliticians shouting each other\ndown simultaneously. The benefits\nof this are twofold - the interviewer\ncan't ask anything and the listener\ncan't understand anything. Next the\n'Man of the People.'\nInterviewer: 'Your party's economic policies have been\ndamned as unworkable widely in\nthe press.

    "content": "Letters Felix 931 18 March 1992\nMary's Dear Adam,\nElections\nLet me start by stating that St\nMary's College Union is aCC U of\nImperial, originally they were an\nindividual unit but had to merge\nwith other London colleges in\nrecent years to prevent closure.\nImperial gave them the support and\nthey became our fourth constituent\ncollege.\nSt Mary's students should\ntherefore be most great e ful to our\nUnion for without us they would not\nexist.\nHow is it then that they gave our\nelector i al candidates such a hard\ntime at the Hustings on 2nd March.\nThere are a number of points I would like to pick up from the front\narticle of Felix 929.\n1. Mary's students believed that\nthe candidates' interest in Mary's affairs was due simply to the\nelection.\nThis is most probably true. When\nthe colleges merged Mary's wanted\nto retain its autonomy from IC and\nthey themselves have little or no\ninterest in IC or its students. So why\nshould we have an interest in them.\n2. Candidates were ridiculed\nwhen they claimed they had an\nactive interest in St Mary's. What else could they say after\nbeing reminded that Ben Turner,\nthe last candidate to say Mary's was\nunimportant, was defeated at first\nballot.\nSpilt Grease\nDear Adam,\nSo many weeks after the original\nincident I feel I should speak up\nonce again. Yes, I am the principal\nco-writer of the infamous Grease\nreview.\nIt has been suggested that I should\n'own up' to writing this review to\nencourage more of the people\nresponsible for removing the\nFelices to own up as well. While\nReality\nDear Adam.\nIn reply to Samin Ishtiaq, Felix\n928.\nFor whatever reasons, if I understand you correctly, my\nintended meaning has been\nhopelessly distorted. I understand\nthat as with all philosophies,\nunderstanding relies very much on\nbeing able to associate ones own\nideas with that being read. I presume the model I presented is of\nfundamental difference to that held\nby Samin. I do not intend to clutter\nthe pages of Felix with detailed\ndescriptions of my own ideas but if\nSamin is interested, I shall try to\nclarify my original article.\nTo begin with there is a critical\ntyping error. The fifth line should\nread 'One version I will call reality,\nthe other O space'. Reality is\nhypothetical space in which all\nthings really do exist'. O space is\nO's perception of this the space in\nwhich things exist (the real\ndefinition) since two people can\nhave a concept of existence we\nextrapolate the state of Reality.\nHowever this misunderstanding I am trying to show is that observer\nI'm at it I think I 'll make a few\npoints:\n1. The figure of \u00a38,000 was the\none being described as the cost of\nthe DramSoc production at that time\nby senior members of the Union. I cannot help being mis-informed.\n2. Having been involved behind\nthe scenes and on the stage of\ntheatrical productions both amateur\nand professional I feel well able to\nspace is not Reality but reality. This\nis why people argue so hopelessly,\nreality has as many versions as there\nare observers while Reality is the\ncommon template. In the respect\nthat the template, the perceptions\nare different there is duplication\nthough no equation.\nTo understand how reality and\nReality are related a mechanical\ndescription of perception is\nrequired. If the brain is the machine\nwe can local is e attention. There is\nxxx (illegible\u2014TS) no way my\nbrain can support an artificial\nreality, Alva-space, in which my\nbrain is accurately modelled. I do\nhowever have a subjective model.\n1 know I have a subconscious which\nI know little about which controls\nmany of my actions including the\nhard processing involved in\nperception. My perception of how\nneural networks work really does\ndescribe 'message' simplification\nchose many modes leads to an on\nor off response. Having processed\nmy information inputs I then have\nto process the patterns in this\nhardcore to have knowledge of what\nI have seen. felt, heard, smelt.\nMary's obviously don't like the\ntruth either.\n3. When Mr Gardini suggested\nthat St Mary's students should come\nto IC Union office when they had\nproblems, he was asked why. he\ncould not come to St Mary's Union\noffice.\nWho do Mary's students think\nthey are? When other C CU members have problems does Zoe\nhave to go to their C CU office to\nhelp them. No. So why should\nMary's be any different?\n4. On the topic of beer prices\nbeing cut:\nMary's again show there\nseparation from IC by having their\nown licence. Our Deputy President\nwould have no say over their prices,\nbut is he not their DP too?\nApparently not.\ncomment on a drama production\nand resent the comment in a letter\nin Felix 928 claiming that the\nreview was 'sheer fiction'.\n3. Apart from the monetary\naspect of the review I stand by it\ncompletely as a fair, not a bad,\nreview.\n4.1 know a lot of work went into\nGrease and I congratulate those\ninvolved for uniting the college over\nthe week.\n5. It is a shame that the review\nhad to take place on the first night\nas, I hear, the final nights were\nexcellent. However, I cannot accept\ntasted, though, remembered, been\ndoing and been motivated. This\nloop I presume gives consciousness.\nWhile I am doing this my actions\nhave already been chosen and\nwithout feedback will commence.\nThis indeed gets experimental\nresults. My conscious knowledge\nand thoughts have no value except\nin the context of this processing I know nothing about. I cannot argue\nfor or against 'a price' knowledge\nother than to say the hardcore and\ntherefore meaning is genetically\ndefined while the picture is\nenvironmentally sti mult ed, measuring the existence of reality.\nSince the meaning is genetically\ndefined the way we perceive the\nworld and all the questions and\nanswers have already been\nfundamentally defined. However it\nwill take the rest of human existence\n(until the next fundamental change\nin brain patterns by evolution) to\nexplore our minds and mental make\nup\u2014both science and art.\nTurning to logic, our brains\npresent to us a model of the world\ncomposed of definite units\u2014can you\nrelate this. Each unit has an\nirrational common sense relation to\nall the others. This meaning is I presume the work of our minds and\ntherefore with 'reason', but to us\n5. Felix editors were heavily\nslated for the newspapers' lack of\ninterest in Mary's affairs.\nLook at last week's issue. Three\narticles about Mary's plus the cover\nstory.\nFelix reporters have enough\ntrouble covering IC alone. Perhaps\nif Mary's made a contribution (or\nthree) to Felix they would provide\na coverage of Mary's affairs.\nIt seems that Mary's students\nresent their link with IC, and\nalthough they have five year\ncourses, they should not be so quick\nto criticise those who are prepared\nto give up a year of their life to give\nsomething back to the union. They\nshould remember if it wasn't for\npeople like these candidates Mary's would not exist.\nLorna Mount ford, Physics I. it being the first night as an excuse.\nIt is the first night that makes or\nbreaks a production\u2014not many get\na second chance.\nI will take a great interest in\nfuture Dramsoc productions and\nwill certainly review them if I am\nable. I have high standards\u2014that\nwill never change.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Henderson-Begg.\nP.S. Advert: 1 bodyguard\nrequired to protect theatrical\nreviewer from irate society. Must\nbe 6'6\" and heavily trained in the\nuse of firearms and martial arts.\nthere is only a bland connection.\nThere connections I referred to as\na tree. The tree as it is presented to\nus really is lifeless. Play the 'why'\ngame as I call it. Make a statement\nand question the meaning of\niterative ly. Eventually you will end\nup with a tautology. Try it one the\nquestions you asked 'Why does Ospace exist?'. I will start you 'what\ndoes exist mean?' I think and\ntherefore I am 'should be your final\ntautology'.\nAs for 'idealistic' what do you\nwant\u2014how can any consciously\ndenied model not be idealistic?\nReturning to Reality how much\nhave we insisted if our conscious\nappears to be sensibly defined by a 'machine' which is only a tiny part\nof Reality. To truly know every\nfacet of Reality in unquestionable\nterms to really know what things are\nyou would have to escape from\nObserver space and become\nReality.\nP.S. Observer space must be a part of Reality too.\nTo conclude if this is all too much\nthere are plenty more hypothesis on\nexistence but are all mentally boring\nas they just label huge categories\n'unknowable' e.g. God.\nI hope this is clearer.\nAlva Gosson.

The\ndefence, glad to have something to\ndo for a change, coped amazingly\nand it was the Dribblers who\nfinished the half on top with two\ngoals from Permi and Jo and\nexcellent defending from Arlene\nand Juliana.\nThe second half was more even\nuntil a sudden penalty gave the\nDribblers a30 lead. Super runs and\ndod gy finishing from Permi (the\ngoal y was big and fat and took up\nthe whole of the goal area)\nmaintained this score line until\nK CH managed to snatch back a goal\nto put them back into contention.\nHowever, a final goal from Permi\nput the Dribblers 4-1 ahead and out\nof reach of K CH. With only five\nminutes left both teams were\nexhausted and it seemed like all the\naction was over...or was it?\nNo, it couldn't be, surely the\nteams in their state of exhaustion\nwere not seeing things. But no! The\nplayers now realised it was no\nRugby Report\ncomparison but their fifth\nconsecutive south-east group title\nand six previous wins in seven\nmatches overall, with an average of\n34 points a match, threw down a challenge which Durham picked up\nponderously.\nDavid Fleming, playing\nalongside Andrew his twin brother,\nran in at welt h minute try from the\nbase of the ruc k, from the drive by\nFowler of Rosslyn Park and\nMontgomery, the influential scrum\nhalf in Imperial's progress.

She charged past\nthe lone defender and headed for the\ngoalkeeper. The crowd erupted in\na frenzy, the players stood and\nwatched in disbelief.\nA whole year of standing on cold,\nwet, muddy pitches had driven the\npoor girl mad and she was behaving\nin a way never witnessed before.\nCharging down the pitch with the\ndefender hot on her heels she took\nit past the goal y, the crowd went\nmad, the team fainted and.. .the ball\ndribbled slowly off the pitch. Alas,\nit wasn't to be the goal that had\neluded the poor woolly hatted one\nall season. We could be tight and\nsay this isn't strictly true, Ethel\nscored a goal last term. Shame it\nwas in the wrong goal though!!\nExhausted and hungry but still on\nform. The Dribblers secured their\nplace as top boat racers in London\nby beating not one but two teams.\nFirst up for the hammering were\nK CH. Caroline was still struggling\nto get over the shock of Ethel's run\nwhich allowed K CH to sneak ahead\nbut IC's back four, Emma, Linday,\nEleanor and Rachel, dashed all\nhopes of aK CH victory with an\neasy win.\nA mixed bag of supporters were\nnext up for the challenge and what\na sad bunch they were. Felix's very\nown photographer led the team with\na pathetic half pint (call yourself a man?). But the girls, in true style,\npolished off their drinks in record\ntime to win by a drink in hand.\nThe captain would just like to\ncongratulate the team on their\nperformance this season. Apart\nfrom winning the league they also\ngot to the semi-finals in the cup. It's been great playing with you all.\nExtra big thanks to Sara and Ethel\nwho, despite my s arcy reports, have\nhad a brilliant season and helped in\nthe running of the club.\nGood luck to you all next year!!\nThe first Felix of next term will\ncome out on Friday 1st May.

    "content": "Opinion Felix 931 18 March 1992\n'These islands are richer than I know or can say. and I have taken\npossession of them in their\nMajesties' name.' So wrote\nColumbus to the monarchs of Spain\nand Europe. Of the people who\nlived on the Caribbean Islands he\nsaid: 'They are yours to command\nand make them work.'\n1992\u2014if you have not yet heard\nmarks the quince n ten nary of\nColumbus' landfall in the\nAmericas. The anniversary is\ngenerating big business: More than\n200 books on Columbus-related\nsubjects are scheduled for release\nthis year; two Hollywood f dms are\nbeing made; not to mention the\nraw materials that fuelled European\nindustrialisation. Today, Latin\nAmerica continues to feed and work\nfor Europe. Cotton, coffee and\nbananas, are raised on huge\nplantations wasting the\nenvironment, while descendants of\nthe indigenous population work in\nappalling conditions.\nTrade barriers forged in Europe\nand the US ensure that Latin\nAmerica contains a producer of raw\nmaterials and cheap labour. The net\ntransfer of resources away from\nthese poor countries is further\nensured by increasingly high prices\nfor imported manufactured goods\nand technology, and also by interest\nlocal community. This was not the\nsort of example that the US wished\nthe rest of Latin America to follow.\nTo emphasise this the US\ngovernment funded guerilla\nwarfare, and led a total economic\nboycott of Nicaragua (backed by\nBritain). The financial squeeze was\ntoo much for the Nicaraguans, and\nlast year, by a narrow margin, the\nSandinistas were voted out.\nHowever, internal pressure to\nmaintain the gains of the revolution\nis still great.\nLess publicised is the fact that\nAmerica is also responsible for\nhaving installed the present military\nregime in Guatamala due to a Go West, Young Man\nTor the\nmajority of\npeople in Latin\nAmerica the\nlegacy of\nColumbus is\npoverty.'\nby Farheen\nKhan.\ncountless television specials being\nplanned, lavish exhibits and official\ncelebration in at least thirty\ncountries.\nIn the US, the centre of the\ncelebrations will be 'Ameriflora\n'92', a$100 million international\nflower show being built in\nColumbus, Ohio. And the excess\ndoes not stop there, there is to be\na symbolic marriage between the\nstatue of Columbus in Barcelona,\nand New York's Statue of Liberty.\nNot one to be left out, our very own\ncity of Birmingham is to supply the\nring. Liverpool, also, is planning\nthe launch of a flotilla of 15th Century style ships, in a mock up\nof Columbus' departure from\nSpain.\nThe first island that Columbus\n'hit' in the West Indies, was that of\nHispaniola, now known as the\nDominican Republic. He set the\npattern for the explorers and\ncolonialists who followed him when\nhe initiated the extermination of the\nTiano people who lived on that\nisland. The Dominican Republic is\nnow indulging in gross celebrations,\nincluding the construction of a colossal lighthouse in honour of\nColumbus. It is said that the\nlighthouse, if switched on, will\nplunge at least half of the island into\ndarkness, as the island does not\ngenerate enough electricity to meet\nthe needs of both the island and the\nlighthouse.\nIn 1492 an estimated 100 million\npeople lived in what we call Latin\nAmerica, compared to only 60\nmillion in Europe. Within 80 years,\nonly 10 million people remained in\nLatin America; the rest succumbed\nto disease, or were killed in wars\nand massacres brought about by the\nEuropeans.\nMany of those who survived were\nenslaved, and, along with enslaved\nAfricans were forced to produce\npayments on debts that annually\nconsume large portions of the\ncountries' GNP.\nThe injustice of the system is all\ntoo apparent for the peoples of\nCentral America, but any attempts\nto create a more just society\nworking for itself, rather than for\nthe rich countries of the North, have\nin the past been sabotaged.\nThe reforms in Nicaragua under\nthe Sandinistas are a well known\ncase in point. The Sandinistas' most\nsignificant policies were those\nconcerning redistribution of land.\nLand used for cash crops was\nbought for the landed elite to be\nredistributed to villagers\n(camp es in os), supposedly leading to\nthe farming of food stuffs for the\nsimilar history of attempted land\nreform. In the early 50s the\nAmerican banana company,\nChiquita, owned around 55% of\npotential arable land in Guatamala.\nThey used only a small percentage\nof this for growing bananas, and\nvast areas of land lay unused. A democratically elected government\ndecided to distribute this land to\nsmall-holders for subsistence\nfarming. This piqued Chiquita,\nwhich in turn led the US\ngovernment to install the current\nregime in the 1954 CIA coup.\nMany in Central America have\nnow realised that change cannot be\nachieved in their own countries\nwithout first changing the attitudes\nof the governments and the general\n\u2014 1 6 \u2014\n18 March 1992 Felix 931 Opinion\nignorance amongst people of the\nNorth. For the majority of people\nin Latin America the legacy of\nColumbus is poverty. Many do not\naccept the legacy and struggle to\nmaintain their traditions and seek\nsocial justice.\nMarch 22nd to 29th is Central\nAmerica Week\u2014a celebration of\nthe resilience of the people, and the\nsurvival of their culture. During this\nweek people in towns throughout\nBritain and Ireland will be making\nlinks with people working for their\nown development in Central\nAmerica.\nFor our part Third World First\nhas invited Margarito Ruiz, a Mexican Maya-Tojolbal Indian, and\nleader of the Independent\nOrganisation of Indian Peoples to\ncome and speak on Thursday 19th March (the week before Central\nAmerica Week), 12.45pm Huxley\nw mm Building, Lecture Theatre 130.\nFor further information about\nevents occur ing around London, or\nin your local area, write to:\nCentral America \"Week,\n82 Margaret Street,\nLondon WIN8 LH. Telephone 071-631 5173.\nResistance and Survival\nNative organisations in Central\nAmerica, South America, Mexico,\nthe US and Canada have been\norganising education campaigns and\npublic protests against official\nColumbus Quincentennial\ncelebrations since 1988. Their aim\nis to expose the hidden history of\ncolonialism and build a new\nrelationship between natives and\nnon-natives based on justice.\nThe size of the indigenous\npopulation in Latin America is\nsubstantial. A minimum of 10%\n(over 40 million) are generally\nconsidered pure Indian, ethnically\nand culturally, and a much higher\nproportion are half-Indian. In many\nregions within countries indigenous\npopulations can constitute 90% of\nthe population. They are present in\nevery Latin American country,\nexcept in most of the Caribbean\nwhere they suffered early\nextermination.\nThese survivors of the European\ncolonialists' ventures are still\nsubjected to discrimination,\nexploitation and oppression, and are\ngenerally in the lower echelons of\nsociety, deprived of influence and\npower. As one Mexican sociologist\nput it, 'The Indian Question is\nessentially one of internal\ncolonialism. The Indian\ncommunities are Mexico's internal\ncolonies...Here we find prejudice,\ndesc rim i nation, colonial types of\nexploitation and dictatorial forms.'\nLatin American indigenous\npeoples reflect a rich diversity\nacross the continent, and live under\noften very different conditions.\nThey do, however, share five\ncenturies of common history, and\na deeply held aspiration for land\n(taken away from their ancestors\nfirst by the colonial powers, and\nnow by the national landed elite,\nand multinational companies),\nautonomy, and culture. Margarito\nRuiz will be addressing, amongst\nother matters, the indigenous\nquestion.\nMargarito Ruiz Hernandez\nMargarito Ruiz is an indigenous\nleader of the Maya-Tojolabal\nIndians. He is a well known figure\nin the field of indigenous rights in\nMexico, and beyond.\nAfter the Andean countries,\nMexico is home to the highest\nnumber of indigenous people in\nLatin America, with an estimated\n8-10 million Indian peoples, made\nup of over 56 different ethnic groups\nThe Mexico Solidarity Group\ntherefore decided that it was\nimportant for a Mexican indigenous\nvoice to be heard in Britain, and\ninvited Margarito Ruiz as a visitor\nduring Central America week. He\nis in Britain for two weeks, giving\ntalks and taking part in conferences\non indigenous rights, 1992 and the\n500 year campaign, land issues,\nhuman rights, and rural\ndevelopment.\nMargarito spends a lot of time\ntravelling and visiting groups within\nMexico, and has also been are pre se native at international\nmeetings. In 1991 he was in Spain\nseveral times as a conference\nspeaker. This will be only the\nsecond time he has spoken in\nBritain.\nAmongst other posts, Margarito\nRuiz is the General Secretary of the\nFIPI (Frente Independiente de\nPueblos Indios), which is a grouping of over 26 indigenous\norganisations from throughout\nMexico. It was formed in 1987, and\nhas been at the forefront for\nindigenous rights in Mexico as well\nas promoting rural development\nprojects in its member\ncommunities.\nHe is involved in a number of\nother organisations, and has been a Deputy (MP equivalent) for the\nPRD, a broad left/centre opposition\ngrouping.\n\u00bb All that there is left to say is that\nMargarito Ruiz will be speaking on\nThursday 19th March, 12.45pm in\nHuxley LT130.\nJOB PANIC Don't Worry - Help is at Hand\nThe way you present yourself will be vital to getting\nthat first job.\nIndividual advice from an insider on how to\n\u2022 apply to firms on spec\n\u2022 write an effective CV and covering letter\n\u2022 make the most of an interview\nFull package including 10 copies of CV, information\npack and practice interview for \u00a320\nCall Julian Hamm on0715852103 for a chat "

Not that\nI often listen to pleasant music, but\nthis is fairly nice for a change.\nFrom the name of the band, I suppose you've guessed that at least\nthe vocalist is female. And that she\nwants to be Wendy James.\nActually, more of the album\nsounds like Tanita Tikaram, but\nthere are a couple of Transvision\nVamp masquerades. And 'It's a Man's World' sounds like Alannah\nMyles.\nShe doesn't sound like Tammy\nWynette on the country and western\nattempt 'Ghost of a Texas Ladies\nMan'. It's a pleasant voice.

This album\ncovers many of their singles. The\nalbum shows what it has taken to\ngive the band such a devout\nfollowing and why, even though\nthey have remained out of the\nlimelight, they are supported on\ntheir seemingly never ending tour\ndates. The songs, which are often\nvery political (5/sf State, High\nWall) are delivered with feeling\nboth lyrically and musically. It\nmakes a great change from\neverything from Rave to Baggie.\nThey have described themselves\nrecently as Hippies with Attitude\nbut I assume this is because of their\nage/ideals and not to do with their\nfloweriness. The album's good if\nyou have not heard much from them\nbefore but I expect the fans are\nwaiting for an album of new\nmaterial. An album of mostly oldies\nafter a live album seems to suggest\nall that touring is wearing them\ndown.\nLouse.\n\u2022 'History', a retrospective of all\nNMA's EMI singles, with two new\nsongs, is released on March 23.\nFrom the first chord of 'First' to the\ndying feedback of 'Tangle' the best\nway to describe this is interesting.\nThat should in no way be\nconsidered an insult, if anything to\nthe contrary. Saili Carson's vocal\nmake you sit up and listen while the\nguitars and drums provide a sort of\nbacking that is worth listening on\nits own. This is most definitely not\neasy listening though. If you want\nto get the full and rich rewards\nseveral listening are required, not\na record to put on for background\nrelief. I can't believe that people\nactually buy records simply to put\non and then go off and do the\nhoover ing. Anyway, after getting\nthat little one off my chest.

Should I have expected\nanything else? Perhaps, perhaps\nnot. On further listens, it wobbles\nits way out from this starting point\nand into a new corner, but still not\ntoo radically different from\nanything they've done before.\nChrysalis will be happy. The fact\nthat 'Rubbish' s chart placing was\nlower than the other two chart\nsingles yet again proves that quality\nhas no guarantee of recognition.\nOn the other side lurks a cover\nof The Smiths' 'Panic', not really\nsuch a radical cover as that of Pet\nShop Boys or Inspiral Carpets, and\nI wonder why they bothered. 'Death\nBy Stereo', as the introductory\nsample says.\nAnd, at last salvation is reached.\nThe best track on the single (12\"\nonly) by far is 'Watching The Big\nApple Turn Over', which, as\nyou've probably guessed, is a song\nabout New York. The best track by\nfar, more orchestrated than any of\nCarter's previous releases, although\nit does show a disturbing tendency\nthat Carter may have given up\ntaking the piss out of the Pet Shop\nBoys, and decided that they want to\nbe the Per Shop Boys.

I assume that the RS M men did OK, as we won 3-2.\nCongratulations to them all and I must say I'm impressed that you all\nmanaged to make it to the game\nafter staying up virtually all night\nand disturbing a couple of young\nladies at the hotel. Curtains to be\npolitely drawn, over such\nshen nani gans. And so now to the magnum opus.\nthe clash of the Olympians. That the\nvery rock beneath Cornwall should\nshudder at the pounding of such\nTitans! The star team was dressed\nin a very sexy new strip, replete\nwith lovely legs and the mandatory\nwell-preened hair on Kurt Budge's head. So to the 'Bottle Match.'\nI am left speechless with\nadmiration at the manner in which\nthe supporters played out their role.\nHods of really loud obnoxious\nsinging, loads of beer consumed\nand a generally wholesome spirit.\nAs for the players - they were under\na lot of pressure from the start. The\nCamborne team had the weight in\nthe scrum ('mainly because they\nwere all fat and flabby' - Gina), and\nthey had the upper hand from the\nmoment they scored their try after\nabout five minutes of play. The\nRSM team fought back though with\na superb try by Jason Brewer, set\nup by Kenny, but sadly the\nconversion was missed by only a few inches. The penalty goal by\nC SM gave them the match but not\nso much by skill as luck. 7-4 to\nCSM but still an enjoyable game.\n(They say that there is more to be\ngained from the playing than the\nwinning - Vm not so sure myself -Ed) Man of the match from my\npoint of view goes to Kenny, who\ncan only be likened to speedy\nGonzales when on the Rugby pitch.\nThe player's dinner was the usual\nriot, butter fights before the starter,\nloud singing throughout and trifle\nfights over dessert. I think a good\ntime was had by all although to be\nquite honest I was not totally\ncoherent for the most of the evening\nin question, but I am sure I'm not\nthe only one.\nHuge congratulations go to Steve\nwho organised the weekend, things\nwent pretty smoothly although I have to pass on a rather esoteric\nmessage on behalf of the Ladies'\nHockey team - 'we would have\nliked more warning that our match\nhad been moved from 12.00pm to\n10.00am, with love and hugs.'\nIn my capacity as Felix trivia\neditor - a new post created\nespecially for me, which will\nprobably expand to take over the\nrest of the paper - I will round up\na few of the plethora of faux pas of\nthe weekend. Honourable mentions\nmust go to -a) Kevin Short and Dave\nMaynard, who spent the best part\nof an hour cheering for RSM at the\nwrong Rugby match. It was no.\nuntil half time that they noticed they\ndidn't actually recognise any of the\nplayers and that neither of the teams\nwere in RSM college colours.\nb) Richard Lloyd for losing his\ncrutches on the Friday night and\nhaving to 'borrow' a walking stick\nfrom the owner of the Hotel in\nNewquay. The reason he was on\ncrutches in the first place is a bit of\na faux pas too - he had dislocated\nhis kneecap 10 days before the\nbottle match was due to take place.\nI don't think he was a very happy\nbunny at all that weekend.\nc) Nick Correy for passing out at\nthe player's dinner before the first\nglass of wine had even been poured.\nHe then completely missed his meal\nand lay comatose in the foyer for\nthe majority of the evening. While\nhe was in repose, Rob Peters who\nwas keeping an eye on him thought\nthat maybe the hotel foyer pot plants\nwere feeling a little hungry and so\nhe fed them the remainder of his\nhalf chicken.\nd) The CSM eg it called Paul who\nagreed to swap his pure silk CSM\nColours tie and tour hat for one of\nour very lovely RS M hats.\ne) Paul, the Norwegian RSM bod,\nwho spent the whole weekend\n'Tangoing' people because he'd seen the advert on the Friday\nmorning just before we left RSM\nand thought that it was the best thing\never. Therefore do not be surprised\nif a number of people walk up to\nyou in the bar on Wednesday\nevening and slap you around the\ncheeks for no apparent reason - it\nseems to have become a bit of a trend.\nf) Dave Maynard (again) for\nhopping out of the minibus at the\nside of the road to go for a piss and\nbeing so inebriated that he fell over\ninto fits of laughter and needed\nthree guys to help him back up\nagain. Shortly after this, Rob from\nC SM ripped his boxers off him\nwithout even attempting to undo\nDave's trousers, Dave then proceed\nto wear them around his neck for\nthe rest of the trip home.\ng) Kenny for setting fire to Gina's leggings in the back of the mini-bus\nand causing the young girl ie to go\ninto a state of shock.\nh) Me for agreeing to write this\nbloody article for Felix in the first\nplace. (That's enough of that -Ed).\nAnd so a final warning to all -next year C SM will be here, so\nwatch out and remember - You\nhave been officially Tangoed!\n\u2014 19\u2014\n\n"

As a result of the behaviour, the kitchens\nin the Union were closed early and\nstaff left with out clearing up after\nthe dinner in protest.\nAndrew Montgomery, ICRFC\nCaptain, admitted there had been a case of indecent exposure but said\nthat it took place during speeches\nwhen serving staff should not have\nbeen in the room. He said that the\ncomments were 'good humour ed and well intention ed' and that these\nwere 'pissed idiots ideas of a compliment.' Mr Montgomery\nadded that he was surprised that the\nstaff took such offence and that\naccusations of sexual assault were\nfalse.\nMr Montgomery claimed that\nmany inaccurate accusations had\nbeen levelled at the Rugby Club this\nyear. He continued by saying that\nZoe Hellinger, ICU President, had\ntold him she wished to make an\nexample of the Rugby Club and\nstamp out sexism once and for all\nat Imperial.\nMs Hellinger later confirmed that\nshe would take proceedings 'all the\nway' at the disciplinary committee\nto be held next term. She added that\nit was 'unacceptable' that\nsupposedly intelligent men treated\nthe Union as a 'spit and sawdust\njoint.'\nAs no one has been identified in\nconnection with the incidents, the\nUnion has decided to take each\nindividual present at the Rugby\nClub Dinner through the\ndisciplinary process. Anyone who\nis found guilty by the disciplinary\ncommittee could face a fine or ban\nfrom Imperial College Union.\nSports Refit\nImperial College Union has been\nasked to pay \u00a3650,000 towards the\nredevelopment of the Sports Centre\nby Imperial College.\nImperial College management\nwish to take the money out of the\nHarlington Trust. This is \u00a3 2 . 7\nmillion produced by the selling of\ngravel found under the College\nsports ground at Harlington. The\nCar Parking\nCollege management want to take\nmoney from the Trust as an interest\nfree loan and ICU is rumoured to\nfind this option unacceptable.\nSources in the Union say that they\nwish to lend the money to College\nat standard Bank base rates or have\na controlling stake in the way the\nSports Centre is run.\nDirector of Estates. Mr Gordon\nMarshall, said yesterday that\nproposals for the future of the\nCollege car park would soon be\nfinalised. Speaking to i CNN, Mr\nMarshall said 'we are still working\non it. and I hope we will know\nwhere we are going fairly soon.'\nThe future of the College car park\nfirst came into question with the\nopening of negotiations on the\nfuture of the Messenger, Security\nand Car Parking services last\nNovember. Following the day of\naction on December 4th. the\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, asked unions\nto consider the car park's future as\nseparate from that of the Messenger\nand Security services.\nWith the signing of the contract\nawarding the Messenger and\nSecurity services in house now\nimminent, attention has turned to\nthe car park. Fears had been\nexpressed that College management\nhad already decided to privat is e the\ncar park, and that tenders had been\nadvertised for and accepted while\nthe messenger and security\nnegotiations were continuing.\nThe delay in reaching a decision\nhas been due to management\n'considering the legality' of the\nproposals on the table, according to\nMr Marshall. This is taken as\nreferring to problems with\ncorporation tax. Late last year,\ncollege unions accused Mr Marshall\nof misleading negotiators on\nwhether corporation tax was due if\nthe car park were kept as part of the\nsecurity service. Unions regarded\nMr.Marshall's stance then as an\n' attempt to force privatisation of the\nentire service. Questions were also\nasked about the car park profit\nfigures put forward by Mr Marshall. Sources claimed that his\nfigures were inaccurate to the tune\nof \u00a375.000.\nChanges in the rents in Imperial\nCollege Halls will be announced on\nApril 30th. in the first week of the\nsummer term.\nIt is believed that the rent\nincreases will be kept to the rate of\ninflation. Mr Angus Fraser, IC\nManaging Director, is reported to\nconsider inflation to be around 5%.\nJonathan Griffiths, IC Union\nDeputy President, is at present\nconducting negotiations with the\nEstates Division of college. He told\ni CNN that no increase in rent would\nbe acceptable this year.\nPrincess Anne, Chancellor of the University of London, visited Imperial\nCollege on Tuesday 10th March, to open the a new Interdisciplinary\nResearch Centre (IRC) in the Chemical Engineering Department. The\nCentre for Process Systems Engineering has been functioning since August\n1989 and is deemed to be the biggest IRC so far.\nSports Refund\nIt has been rumoured this week that\ncollege staff will receive a refund\nof up to \u00a3 1 0 on their yearly sports\ncentre membership fees.\nMs Caroline Osner. IC Sports\nand Leisure Manager, is believed to\nhave said that a refund may be given\nto all IC staff, reducing membership\ncosts to \u00a324. This compares to the\nannual student fee of \u00a318, but it was\nrumoured that student money would\nnot be refunded because \"it would\nbe too difficult to administer.'\nMs Osner has been on holiday\nthis week and therefore unavailable\nto comment on the rumours, as has\nMr Rob Coleman, Sports Centre\nManager. Ms Val Straw, IC\nFacilities Manager, and Director of\nEstates, Mr Gordon Marshall, were\nalso both unavailable for comment.\nRoom with a Queue\nAfter last minute negotiations the\nnumber of rooms provided for\nstorage in Southside Halls over\nEaster has been increased. Due to\nlarge block bookings for\nconferences many people will have\nto move from their rooms over\nEaster. This has provided an\nincrease in the amount of storage\nrequired, but until the beginning of\nthe week only 14 rooms had been\nprovided. This is a reduction from\nthe usual number of 16 rooms.\nMiss Nicky Fox, ICU Housing\nofficer, is believed to have\nrenegotiated the position so the full\n16 rooms could be used. At present\n10 rooms in Linstead and 3 in\nWeeks Hall are to be used for\nstorage.\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix 931 18 March 1992\nMost atmospheric phenomena have\nequivalents in the ocean.\nAtmospheric cyclones and\nanticyclones, the large-scale rapidly\nrotating masses of air which so\naffect the British weather, are very\nsimilar in structure to so called\nocean gy res. Jets, the\ngeographically fixed regions of fast\nflowing air or water, can be found\nin both the atmosphere and the\nocean.\nThe greatest difference is in the\nscale of motion. Ocean gy res are of\norders of magnitude smaller than\natmospheric cyclones: tens of\nkilometres rather than thousands.\nThe water in gy res and oceanic jets\ntravels at speeds of a few\ncentimetres per second compared\nwith the tens of metres per second\nfor atmospheric flows. The slow\nspeeds do not make the ocean\ncirculation any less energetic than\nthe atmospheric flow: water is\ntypically one thousand times denser\nthan air and even a slowly moving\nmass can have a lot of clout.\nWhat the lower velocities\nThe effect of life\non the biosphere\nis phenomenal\ninvolved in ocean circulation do\nmean is that the ocean responds to\nany forcing much more slowly than\nthe atmosphere. The oceans can act\nas the planet's long term 'memory'.\nThe oceans are more resistant to\nchange than the atmosphere and it\nhas been suggested that their\npresence will actually delay the\nonset of any greenhouse effect\nglobal warming. The downside is\nthat even if man and his industry\nwere to disappear off the face of the\nEarth tomorrow, it would be\ncenturies before the atmosphere and\noceans recovered. It is rather like\npushing a large mass on a trolley.\nIt may take some time and effort to\nget it moving but when it is, it\nbecomes very, very difficult to stop.\nSo far, this has been a rather\nparochial discussion of climate\nchange dealing only with changes\nin the planet itself. I have ignored\nthe variations in the amount of solar\nradiation reaching, and powering,\nthe planet. There are also small\nchanges associated with the slight\neccentricity of the Earth's orbit, but\nthese have periods of only a year.\nIt is believed that it is longer term\nchanges, the tilt of the planet, the\nshape of the orbit, and solar\nactivity, that affect the climate.\nAmong the first people to\ninvestigate this idea was a Yugoslav\nastronomer, Milutin Milankovich,\nworking during the 1920s and '30s. He calculated that these long term\nvariations could, over the space of\na hundred thousand years, account\nfor variations in sunlight of as much\nas 20%. Experiments running for\nthousands of years are not yet\npossible, but work has been done\nto investigate how well the\nMilankovich theory works in the\nshorter term. Not all climate\nresearchers are that taken with the\nresults.\nRecent work comparing changes\nin the average Northern hemisphere\nland temperature, with variations in\nthe solar cycle, shows an\norganisms have on the planet. But\neven ignoring man and all his\nindustry, even ignoring all things\nanimal, the effect of life on Earth,\nthe biosphere, is phenomenal.\nOn land, forests can act as .\ngigantic wind breaks sucking\nenergy from the atmosphere.\nGrowing crops can alter the rate at\nwhich water evaporates, and affect\nrainfall, and leaf cover can reduce\nthe amount of radiation reaching the\nground. Conversely, changes in\ntemperature and radiation can alter\nthe growth of the plants. The\nrainforests, in particular, can thrive\nonly in a climate that changes little\nthroughout the year.\nIt is possible to add the effect the\nplant-life has on the atmosphere to\nthe models. It is considerably more\ndifficult to include the effects of the\nconstantly moving up and down,\nbetween the dark, inhospitable\ndepths and the surface.\nIt is only in the spring, when the\noceans are at their calmest and the\nplankton remain close to the\nsurface, that large amounts of C02\nare absorbed. Dr Woods argues\nthat, if a warmer world were to\nmean more turbulent oceans, the\nannual period of calm would\nbecome shorter, the plankton would\nbe unable to absorb as much gas,\nand the enhanced greenhouse effect\nwould be enhanced still more.\nThere is evidence to suggest that the\n7 degree warming, that ended the\nlast ice age, was due, at least in\npart, to creatures too small to be\nseen.\nThere will be some changes that\nno-one can predict. Changes, not in\nthe atmosphere or the ocean or the\nbiosphere but, in the Earth itself. It\nis known that the huge quantities of\ndust and ash, thrown out by\nvolcanic eruptions, can cool the\nsurface of the planet. There was\nmuch talk about the global cooling\nThe most\nimportant factor\nof all: the\npolitics of\nclimate change\ncaused by the recent eruption of\nMount Pinatubo, in the Philippines,\nand it has been argued that it was\nan 'artificial winter', produced by\nthe dust from a colossal meteor\nstrike, that wiped out the dinosaurs.\nClimate research could easily\ndegenerate into arguments along the\nlines of 'what if this...', 'what if\nthat...': anything you can do, we\ncan find a perfectly valid counter-argument. Theories are no good\nwithout either observational, or\nexperimental backing. Experiments\nare impractical as there is no lab\nlarge enough to hold a thirteen-thousand-kilometre wide ball of\nrock. It is for this reason that\nclimatic experiments must resort to\nsimplified mathematical models,\nand computing, with all the\nproblems this brings. The only way\nwe can discover what happens on\nthe real Earth is through\nobservations, and these too have\ntheir own problems.\nIn the second of these articles, I will look at what this evidence is,\nwhat experiments have been done,\nand what could be the most\nimportant factor of all: the politics\nof climate change.\nastonishing correlation.

    "content": "Feature Felix 931 18 March 1992\nSomewhere, buried deep inside\nthat part of the subconscious visited\nonly by exceptionally nosy\npsychiatrists, must lie our basic\nneed to panic. Over just the last few\ndecades, we have worried our\ncollective way, from the Red\nMenace and Nuclear holocausts,\nthrough to chronic overpopulation\nand AIDS. It seems that people\nhave always needed that 'little\nsomething' to keep them awake at\nnight.\nWhat all these paranoia s shared\nwas a basis in truth surrounded by\na mass of myth and speculation.\nThe same is true of the current\nfavourite: the nineties nightmare of\ncatastrophic global warming. We\nare told that, if mankind does not\ncut back on the use of fossil fuels,\nrecords show changes in conditions\nfrom year to year and we all know\nthat the weather can change\nsuddenly, from clear and dry, to\ncloudy and wet in a matter of\nminutes. All these changes, on all\nthese different timescales, are (for\nwant of a better word) completely\n'natural'. The atmosphere is nearly,\nif not totally, chaotic.\nIf mankind is changing the\nclimate, the effects will not be easy\nto see amid all the background\nnoise. There will definitely be no\nsteady increase in temperature.\nThere will be no simple obvious\nsigns. We do not even know exactly\nwhat to look for or even if we have\nseen it already.\nThat last point is especially\nimportant. Whatever you may hear\nGlobal Warmi\nPart I. Jason\nLander, one\ntime IC student\nand now a meteorologist at\nReading\nUniversity, looks\ninto the\nturbulent\natmosphere.\nthe consequences could be\ncatastrophic, not just for us, but for\nmuch of the life on this planet.\nThis is an extreme view, based as\nmuch on imagination as\ninvestigation, but at its heart lie hard\nfacts and carefully thought out\nscientific theories: the trick is\nfinding them.\nGlobal warming is, according to\nthe most simplistic theories, a wholly man-made problem: we\nburn fossil fuels and the\ntemperature rises - simple cause and\neffect. This is, not to put so fine a point on it, ill-informed\n'eco babble'. The climate, or 'average'\nweather, of this planet has never\nbeen fixed. Geological records\nshow that the Earth has undergone\nhuge changes in surface\ntemperature with a whole series of\nice ages, each tens of thousands of\nyears long, separated by warmer\nperiods like the present day. The\ncentury, or so, of man-made\nfrom some quarters, there is little\nevidence that we have witnessed the\nfirst signs of climate change.\nCertainly, the theory that the Great\nStorm which hit Britain in October\n1988 was a direct result of\nincreasing temperatures, an idea\nreinforced by a recent Governmentinspired advertising campaign, is\nvery much a matter of dispute. It\nwould be equally valid to say that\na warmer world would lead to\nfewer such storms, not more.\nIt gets worse. If we accept that\nglobal warming is a reality, and we\ndo see a large increase in the global\naverage temperature, we have no\nreal idea of what this will bring. We\nknow that if the global average\ntemperature increases, the polar ice\ncaps will begin to melt and sea\nlevels will rise. We know that a change in the distribution of rain\nwill affect the distribution of plant\ngrowth. What we do not know is\nhow drastic these changes will be.\nAt one extreme, there are those\nwho believe that any change will be\ngradual and that mankind will be\nable to cope. At the other, there are\nthose who look at the carefully\nbalanced ecosystems of the tropical\nrainforests and the masses of ice at\nthe edge of the Antarctic and predict\nmass extinctions and an inundation\nof 'biblical' proportions.\nWe do not yet fully understand\nthe way the atmosphere and oceans\nbehave. Until we do, it would be\nwise to treat any predictions of\nclimate change with a certain\namount of scepticism; equally it\nwould be a serious mistake to say\nthat human activity is NOT leading\nto global warming.\nIt should be remembered that,\nsupporting all the predictions from\nthe most conservative to the frankly\nridiculous, there is a perfectly valid\nand coherent theory. There is some\nevidence to back it up and, ignoring\nall the arguments over the details,\nit is remarkably straight forward.\nTHE THEORY If mankind is causing global\nwarming this must be due to an\nenhanced 'greenhouse effect'. The\nkey word there is 'enhanced': the\ngreenhouse effect is neither a new\ntheory nor a controversial one. It is\nthe greenhouse effect that keeps the\nsurface of this planet warm enough\nto live on.\nLike any complicated machine,\nthe Earth requires a constant supply\nof energy and the source for almost\nall this energy is the high frequency,\nshort wavelength, radiation from\nthe Sun. Yet back of the envelope\ncalculations, equating the energy\nsupplied by the Sun with the energy\nwhich must be radiated away by the\nEarth simply by virtue of its surface\ntemperature, suggest that this\ntemperature should be around\nminus 20 degrees Celsius.\nThe factor that is missing from\nthe back of the envelope, and which\nmakes the planet habitable, is the\naction of the atmosphere.\nAll bodies must radiate energy.\nIn the vacuum of space, this energy\ncan only be in the form of\nelectromagnetic waves: waves with\ncharacteristic frequencies and\nwavelengths. Physical theory says\nthat this frequency must be related\nto the surface temperature of the\nbody: a warmer body will emit\nradiation of higher frequency and\nshorter wavelength. The radiation\nreaching the warm Earth from the\nmuch hotter Sun will be of shorter\nwavelength than that emitted from\nthe planet itself.\nAll gases can absorb radiated\nenergy but will not absorb all\nfrequencies of radiation. In\nparticular, certain gases in the\nEarth's atmosphere, the so-called\n'greenhouse gases', are largely\n\u2014 2 6 -\n"

    "content": "18 March 1992 Felix 931 News Review\nThe Christmas holiday, and\nholidays in general, are a bonanza\nfor hacks and fixers. Yet, come the\n6th of January, when all return to\nthe beer garden that is IC, the\njourn os bounce back, fresh with\ncynicism, asking, 'OK, what fast\none have they pulled this time?'.\nThe 'they' is both the Ashite\nmanagers and the Union bod s, who\nwork with a similarity so close that\nthey deny it, even though both\nteams have jugglers. To prove the\npoint, just when you thought it was\nsafe to leave the beer garden, and\nthat Felix was no more, it's back,\nwith a look back (in anger?\ncontempt? amazement?\ndrunkenness?) at the i CNN news\nthis term.\nThe first fast one was the\nSherfield Five (Ash, Fraser,\nReynolds, Straw, Marshall) trying\nto fix up the Messenger, Security\nand Car Parking privatisation\nbefore anyone could notice.\nthe academics,\nsensing blood,\nwere in full\nflight\nHowever, the plans rapidly came\nunstuck, or even noticed, so this\nterm, the 'Quick Release Ball and\nChain' award goes to Gordon\nMarshall, Head of Estates, for his\nrapid about-face on the proposals.\nThe original document suggesting\na review of security was published\non 19 April 1991, by Facilities\nManager, Val Straw. By the time\nGordon Marshall had re-drafted it\non 27 September, the document\nread, 'in the light of this further\nreview, it is considered necessary\nand desirable to pursue a radically\ndifferent staffing strategy.' How\nradical? How different? Read on.\nit is proposed that staffing below\nthe management/secretary level\nshould utilise uniformed contract\nstaff.' And whose signature was on\nthe front of the new radical\ndocument? Gordon Marshall.\n'Privatisation', said the unions.\n'Outsourcing', said the Rector.\n'You're sacked', said Marshall, to\nall Security, Messenger and Car\nPark staff. The academics, sensing\nblood, were in full flight, '...the\nnew style of management could be\ninappropriate for an academic\ninstitution ... the style is in fact\nmore akin to imposition', wrote the\nChairman of the Academic Staff\nCommittee. When Gordon\nMarshall wrote casting doubts on\nthe loyalty of long serving staff, the\nCity and Guilds Dean, Professor\nBruce Sayers, hit back. T draw you\nattention to the brutality, no\nimpertinence, of Gordon Marshall\n... writing of the anticipated\n'loyalty' of bought in contract\npersonnel. (This is) not the only ill-conceived component, there are\neven greater stupidities. These\nfactory floor manoeuvres are\nwholly unworthy of IC.'\nAt this point, the Rector, sensing\ndefeat, jumped back on the fence,\nso that Uncle Eric could come along\nand sort out a little difficulty in 'our\ncommunity'. However, the\nswitching from subtraction to\naddition.\nThe irony was not lost that the\nman who wanted privatisation and\nan end to union influence will\nprobably go from the college before\nthe union negotiators. It could, of\ncourse, be argued that he should\nhave gone earlier. Such a policy\nswitch would have intimidated\nmost. His selective amnesia could\nyet put considerable distance\nbetween his actions and their\nconsequences.\nIn an interesting aside, how\nclosely did you read 'The Survey'?\n(Felix 928). Keith Reynolds, Chief\nSecurity Officer, worked in the\nSpring News Review\nStrikers gather outside the Rector's house on Queensgate during the Security & Messenger dispute.\nGoverning Body had cottoned on to\nwhat the Ashites had done, and sent\nthe Rector away with a firm slap on\nthe wrist. 'The Rector was charged\ndirectly with looking at the\nproblems of communication.' And\nthat was something he couldn't contract out.\nSo it came to pass that the\n'negotiations' (sic) continued on\ninto term two. After some\nconfusion, agreement was reached\non 7th February between the Head\nof Estates and the Unions on an in-house settlement. The security\nservice was improved, savings were\nmade, and the unions kept most of\ntheir members in work.\nKeeping them in line was a \u2022different job. There was a bit of\ngrumbling about a sell out, but\napparently the union leaders got the\ngo ahead to sign. But sign they\ndidn't. The calculators on Sherfield\nare still getting stuck on their sums.\nMaybe they are having difficulty\nmedia industry before he came to\nImperial. Val Straw, Facilities\nManager, came from the\ncommunications industry. That's two out of five, though they aren't the only ones. According to London\nWeekend Television, Simon\nWesterman, Catering Manager,\nworked as one of their contract\ncaterers. London Weekend\nTelevision recently contracted out\ntheir security services, to the\nunions, who set up a small\ncompany, and made a small profit\ninto the bargain. What was the\nname of the union negotiator?\nSomebody Snow, I think.\nMore plaudits for Gordon\nMarshall, and the Estates division,\nand this time the consequences of\nactions are already beginning to\nshow. The 'Dripping Dodgy\nDrainpipe' goes to the maintenance\nsection of Estates. In a set piece\nexample of crisis management, the\ndripping Clayponds showers were\nDeclan Curry,\nof the Imperial\nCollege News\nNetwork\n(i CNN), collates\nthe major issues\nof this term so\nfar\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
