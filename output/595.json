    "content": "The Case for Deterrents\nIC Conservative Society\nanswers CND\nLast week C ND put forward a number of arguments for unilateral\ndisarmament which we believe are totally misleading. Their arguments\nare strung together with half-truths and over simplifications and we\nbelieve it is now time for realism.\nThe Soviet Union, over the last ten years, has amassed the largest\narmed force ever seen in the history of mankind. They have spent no less\nthan 17% of their GNP on military purposes, building up an enormous\narsenal of the most sophisticated nuclear and conventional weapons\nmodern technology affords. Can we really believe that these are for\ndefence purposes only? Like it or not, the evidence points in the opposite\ndirection. Leaving strategic nuclear missiles aside, the Soviet block has\nan enormous force of Badger, Blinder and Flogger bombers, each\ncapable of flying low under our radar net to \"nuke\" every city in the land.\nEven with our full complement of 380 Tornados, there is no way we can\nrepel this Russian force. Soviet SS20s, based in Eastern Europe, are also\naimed at every city in the UK. We have nothing to counter them. These\nare hardly moves by a peace-loving nation to defend itself.\nLast weekend a Soviet Whiskey class submarine was washed ashore\nnear a major Swedish naval base in the Baltic. The Russian claim that the\nsub had compass and steering problems is ludicrous as no submarine\nwould have been able to penetrate into the complex system of fjords and\nchannels without full control. So what was a Russian submarine doing\nspying on Swedish naval defences? The only realistic conclusion is that it\nwas attempting to gain intelligence as to the effectiveness of Swedish\ndefences against attack.\nOur only defence against the Soviet bloc has been our nuclear\ndeterrent. Its purpose has been to prevent war by making it clear to a potential aggressor that, however much force he might use against\nNATO, he could not hope to win. It is only this facility that has kept and\nwill continue to keep peace in Europe.\nLast week you read C ND's arguments. They try and delude\nthemselves into believing that the Soviet conventional superiority is not\nrealistic as they have less sophisticated weapons that NATO. Do they\nreally believe that the M16 21 \"foxbat\", the fastest aircraft on earth, is\ninferior to NATO capability? The Soviets possess some of the most\nsophisticated and effective weapons available in far greater numbers than\nNATO. C ND then claim that a computer failure that had NATO bombers ready for take-off could cause nuclear war. A bomber on the\nrunway threshold is a long way from a bomber over its target. It is\nrefreshing to see that this computer error was spotted even before the\naircraft got airborne.\n\"/ couldn't place the\nsmell before hut now\nI 've got it. It's mothballs.\"\nSet against reality, C ND's calls for us to unilaterally disarm are nothing\nshort of madness. We must not allow future generations to mention the\nUK in the same breath as Afghanistan, Hungary or Czechoslovakia.\nThese countries were defenceless, and they paid a heavy price for their\nfolly. To use the words of Denis Healey: \" Once we cut defence\nexpenditure to the extent where our security is imperilled, we have no\nhouses, we have no hospitals, we have no schools. We have a heap of\ncinders.\"\n7C Conservative Society\nIf we got rid of our nuclear weapons, would we be any less safe from\nattack? Again, here we must look at hard facts, not waffle. Afghanistan\nhad no nuclear weapons, yet this has not stopped its people from being\nbutchered by Soviet napalm and poison gas. If we lay down our nuclear\ndeterrent, there is nothing we can do to stop that very poison gas drifting\ndown the Thames Valley instead of the valleys of Afghanistan.\nWe can only disarm when we are sure that the Soviet Union does not\nhave the superior capability or desire to attack us. This can only be\nachieved by multilateral disarmament, where both sides disarm on a parity level. This is the only way we can realistically lay down our nuclear\narsenal.\n*' No, no, Ivan.

    "content": "YA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WNYA WN\nDear Sir\n1. The decision that Guilds would not sell the Rag Mag was taken by General Committee.2. The jokes concerning Deptford lire, the Moorgate tube disaster, the death of Johnny Owen, the victims of the Yorkshire Ripper and purely racist jokes caused much concern.3. I resent the implication in Mr Y's letter that he knows more about the scandal and intrigue of Guilds than we do.\n4. M rY is shorter than Mr X.5. Jokes about the disabled abound in the Rag Mag.6.1981 is the International Year of the Disabled.7. I appreciate that letters\nfull of inaccuracy and insult\nmake good reading, but I don't write them. Ones that\nmake good reading that is.\nTours\nAndrew Rush to nPS: Sorry this is so serious\nfolks.\nTo Scientists\nOver the past few weeks\nthere has been a lot of activity by C ND. But what is the\nchance of success of such movements? Politicians have taken little notice of public opinion in the past and they\nare not likely to now: the\n2 x105 people at the C ND rally\nin London is still a big way from representing the opinion of the majority of people in this country( cf 2 . 5 xl06 when the Pope was in Ireland and the population of Ireland is\nonly34 xl06). Those in power will only take notice\nwhen their position of powers threatened( eg Magna Carta). However the politicians' would not be able to do harm to anyone if they did not receive the support of scientists\n( i.e. scientists make the weapons of war). So it is time that the scientists of the whole world remove the teeth of their polit cal 'masters'.\nIn the past there has been\nquite active support for anti apartheid at this College and there was some success at\ndiscouraging those who were\nintending to take jobs in and associated with South Africa. Should not the same now be\ndone to those intending tc take MoD posts, and any company that does work for\nthe government of a 'defence'\nnature. Of course this is only a start\nto obtaining disarmament and much more activity nationwide and worldwide is\nrequired. This could possibly\ntake the form of one hour, one\nday, one week, strikes by scientists who have been working on 'defence' systems\nand have decided something must be done to stop the power-lust of politicians. By starting oil' with token strikes\none could assess the support\nthroughout the world before\nattempting to have a complete\ndissociation from all be liger ent work. Time is running out and it\nwill be along time before\norgan is a it on s like C ND will represent a large enough proportion of the population to have any influence on politicians so scientists must\nact now. You don't have to\nsupport C ND, be a com mu nist, vegetarian, med it at or, Christian or member of any minority group. You don't even have to be interested in the welfare of othe r human beings, just self-preservation\nwill do.M. Law lor Physics\nDear Mark\nHaving read the \" Alternative View of Industrial Society\", I feel moved to reply.\nThe second part of N. Wilson's article I agree with. Industry is considered boring and in the UK much of it is.\nBut this is half the problem. It\nis not dynamic, it is not going anywhere, other countries overtake us and consequently,\nwe arc in a mess. This may not inspire many people, but\nwithout industry we would all live in caves and walk to our berry trees in rags. An intellectually appealing job is\ngreat, but someone has to\nmake the cash, and allow people like N. Wilson to come to university. Finally, Iam surprised that\nthe Industrial Society is so\ncontroversial as to inspire anyone to write in complaining about it. Does this show we\nhave succeeded in our aims?\nChief Propagandist C Wil shaw Che mEng4 PS:I have n't got a job yet but\nam open to oilers.\nDear Mark\nMessrs Evans and Trotter in FELIX594 appear to\nre qui e some enlightening of\nmy views concerning Tony Benn( formerly Viscount Stansgate) and his ultimate ambitions. That Benn wishes\nto set up a Soviet style state\nwe have to deduce from the\nevidence; of course Benn has\nnot said that he wishes to do\nthis but the things that he has\nsaid he would do if he was to\ngain power forces me to this\nconclusion. And judging by\nwhat has happened in other\ncountries where there has been a communist takeover\nthe Russians have moved in\nrather quickly afterwards. Benn' s desire to deprive this\ncountry of our defences is\nfurther evidence of this.\nNow for the specific points\nthat they raised:\n1. The NEC of the Labour party is the committee which controls the party and under a Benn government this would control labour MPs on\npain of being ousted from their seats if they did not vote\naccording to NEC wishes. This committee would thus\nbecome the law making body in the land and not parliament. I trust that the analogy with the Politburo is clear.\n2. The rules governing the\npolice force and their activities\nare already very strict; this is\nevinced by the number of\nsuccess l ul prosecutions brought against offending police officers. It follows therefore that any further attempt( by Benn) to impose\nmore restrictions on the police\nis designed to gain control of\nthe force to use them for\npolitical purposes which they\nare not used lor at present.\nIn conclusion I should point out that Messrs Evans and Trotter failed to mention that I showed that Benn' s attitude towards the media and nationalisation also displays his desire lor soviet is a tion.\nYours wit haul personal abuse\nFrank James\nDear Mark\nThis is just a short letter to\nanswer some of the points\nraised by Mr N. Wilson in his\narticle last week about IC In dust i al Society.\nIn dSo c is not'' well funded\" \u2014 it draws a Union grant just like all the other\nclubs and societies and extra money is obtained from student subscriptions, etc.\nLeaving aside the \" industry is wonderful propaganda\" which I find as asinine as\neveryone else, let's concentrate on what In dSo c actually does instead of what it says: it\norganises talks and visits to\nfactories, gas rigs, etc., so that\nIC students can go and ask\nquestions and draw their own conclusions as to how industry is run. PR men are avoided. Some jobs are boring, I agree, (we can' tall be brain surgeons or Lunar astronauts)\nbut often boredom at work can be relieved by good job\ndesign \u2014 a factor often over-looked when designing plant, machinery, management systems, etc. So if you' re as\nsocially committed as you would have us believe, Mr Wilson, go into industry and help make people's jobs \u2014 and hence their lives \u2014 more interesting.\nFinally, I urge Mr Wilson to pull his head out of his\narse \u2014 he should try going without food, clothing, shelter\nand transport and he'll soon\nsee how\" dull\" they are.\n) ours sincerely\nA.Mil j kov icC he mEng4 Page 2 FELIX, November 6, 1981\n\n"

Considering the amount of time and\neffort Chris Wil shaw( the Chairman) has\ndevoted to the Society's activities, questioning\nhis motives is superfluous as well as petty. (He\nhas no \"job lined up\").\n2. Making money has a strong appeal to\nmost people.\n3. Many others which I shan't list here (see\nChris Wilshaw's letter).\nSo, on to the secrets of our diary.

He's getting rather old now, and finds it\ndifficult to get out and visit his friends, and the\nbest way for him to keep in touch with them is\nby telephone. At least it would be if only he\ncould remember his number.\n'I know it has five digits,' he told me, 'but I can never be quite certain what they are. Let\nme see, is it\n12451 ?\nor 21853 ?\nor 34133 ?\nor 44901 ?\nor 51865 ?\nor 69635 ?\nor 77984 ?\nor 82601 ?\nor 97120 ?\nor 07980 ?\n'Well would you believe it, I really have no\nidea which is right.'\nThe obvious thing seemed to be a quick look\nin the directory which revealed that each\nnumber that Weatherspoon had given me had\njust one digit correctly placed.\nWhat is his number?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please.

The obvious way to do this\nis to write them out in the horizontal rows of a rectangle, and then to read down the columns.\nWhether you take a19 x9 rectangle, a57 x3,3x57 or whatever, this method does not work.\nNow mathematicians should have spotted\nthat 171 (the number of letters in the message)\nis a triangle number i.e. the letters can (and, of\ncourse must) be arranged in a triangle.

Some wrap\nthemselves up with their careers, their family, sport, entertainment, etc.,\ntrying not to look too far ahead. Others devote their energies to politics,\nsometimes for personal power, often in an attempt to find solutions to\nsociety's problems. Often they find the problems of society are deep and\nextensive and the answers none too effective. It's in this context that we\nask whether or not Christianity is relevant.\nSociety is made up of individuals and Christians believe that it is in the\nindividual (you and me) that the problem lies. The Bible says that the root\ncause is that we live without regard to God. Both our action and our\ninaction separate us from God( technically our sin).\nThroughout history we have shown ourselves to be powerless to sort\nourselves out in this respect. Nowadays we are not technologically\ndisable, morally so, failing to apply the wonders we discover as God would have us do.\nGod's answer is \"down to earth\" in two ways. On the one hand it's relevant and on the other it involved the sacrifice of himself. As you may\ngather, this title refers to Jesus Christ, God's Son and the good news\nabout him.\nThat he was born as a man (sent down to earth), lived a life without sin,\nwas executed for no good reason and has been raised, from death to life\nwith God. The Bible puts it this way:\nYou see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless,\nChrist died for the ungodly. But God demonstrates his own love\nfor us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\nBy raising Chist from death, God showed that he accepts Christ's sacrifice of himself for our sin and has removed the banner which\nseparates us from him, so that:\nWhoever believes in him (Christ) shall not perish but have\neverlasting life.\nIt we believe in Christ, and turn to God( away from sin) he offers a personal friendship to us, putting everything else we value in its proper\nplace, and he makes life well worth living. At first sight it seems too good\nto be true, but then God is practical and knows what we need.\nThe purpose of this next week is that people should know that\nChristianity is about the good news of Jesus Christ leading to a dynamic\nrelationship with the living God. The Events\nMonday^ November 9: The Awful Truth, 7:00pm, Read LT, Sherfield\nTuesday, November 10: To the Bitter End, 7:00pm, Read LT Thursday, November 12: Richard Meyrick, 7:00pm, Read LT.

All meetings will last about one hour.\nOther events will be happening during the week in departments. Look\nout for the posters.\nWho's Who\nDavid Marrow: David will be the speaker at three of the evening\nmeetings. He is a vicar from the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight. Before\nstudying theology at St. John's College, Nottingham, and at Tyndale Hall,\nBristol, he was a door-to-door salesman for a vacuum cleaning company.\nHe has worked in the church in Ethopia for four years leaving when the\nrecent war began. He is married with four young children.\nRichard Meyrick: Richard is a professional concert pianist of some\nstanding. He began to study the piano at the age of ten, more recently at\nthe Royal College of Music. He has toured Poland, Canada, the USA and\nnext year the Soviet Union. Richard is a Christian and finds that God relates to him\u2014even in his music.\nCornerstone Theatre Company: Cornerstone are a group of\nprofessional actors based at Jesmond Parish Church in Newcastle-upon Tyne. They are made up of three men and two girls and will be\nperforming in and around College during the week.\nPage 10 FELIX, November 6, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "NUS? No thanks!\nDespite the fact that our long dissociation\nfrom NUS has not resulted in the predicted\ncollapse of student services and lac ili ties at\nIC (far from it-there has been a distinct\nimprovement), there remains a small body of\npeople who still feel we ought to throw 10% or\nso of our annual budget into the bottomless\npit of NUS expenditure. So I am called to put\nyet again the reasons for not being part ot the\nNUS, particularly for the benefit of new\nstudents.\nFirst a history lesson. ICU was a founder\nmember of the NUS, and since then it has\nbeen in and out several times. The last\nwithdrawal came after a very close vote in a referendum early in 1977. The majority was\njust five votes. But a second referendum in\nNovember 1978 (after students had experienced life outside NUS) was much more\nconclusive. Out of a massive turnout of over\n2,500 students (compare that with typically\n1,700 in sabbatical elections) there was a substantial majority of 344 in favour of\ncontinued d is affiliation. This was even with\nthe NUS enjoying the support of the ICU\nPresident and most other officers. So ICU\nremained outside NUS and still does to this\nday. Apart from several Scottish universities\nand Kings College (at the moment) we are the\nonly large university institution outside NUS,\nand have been d is affiliated longest. This is\nalmost certainly due to the unique nature of\nImperial College and outlook of the students\nwho come here.\nThe National Union of Students represents\n1.2m students, full-time and part-time, in FE\ncolleges, universities, polytechnics and\ninstitutes of higher education all around the\ncountry. In England there is only one major\nstudents union which is not affiliated to the\nNUS and that is Imperial. A few years ago in a campus-wide referendum, LCU decided to\nleave the NUS by a majority of just five votes\nin a total ballot of two thousand. (The last\nCollege-wide referendum just three years ago\nproduced a larger majority of over three\nhundred, but there was still a substantial\namount of support for NUS\u2014about 43% of\nvotes cast). Next Tuesday, at the second\nUnion General Meeting of term, David\nAaronovitch will be talking about NUS, and at\nthe same meeting a motion will be put\nforward calling for a referendum on NUS\nmembership. I believe we should accept this\ncall for a referendum and subsequently vote\nto re affiliate. There is, and probably will only ever be,\none national students organisation and that is\nNUS. No other in the for see able future will\nreplace it. Government accepts NUS as our\nrepresentatives, asking each year that NUS\nshould submit student grant claims and give\nevidence to select committees on, for\nexample, overseas students and housing.\nLast year's grant claim from NUS earned\nstudents an increase of 8% which to someone\non the maximum grant meant an increase of\naround \u00a3120. Negotiating on grants has been\none of the most important facets of NUS but\nin recent years much more has been done of\ngreat importance to all students. NUS\nnegotiated on behalf of Imperial during the\nlast government cuts and managed to retain\nanother \u00a33m in the education budget. Most\nAfter such a long time outside NUS we are\nin a good position to judge what benefits we\nhave lost by not being members (and what we\nstand to gain by affiliation). Voters in the two\nreferenda did not have this period to look\nback on, only various hacks warning of the\ngloom, doom and destruction which would\nresult from being outside the NUS.\nSo what have we lost, what benefits are we\nmissing by virtue of our withdrawal from the\nmain stream of the 'student movement'\n(whatever that is, comrades!). One needs to\nlook long and hard. There are a few colleges\nwho refuse to make a reciprocal agreement\nwith us for mutual use of facilities (notably\nChelsea College). The Union does not\nreceive the endless flow of bump h which\nemanates from Endsleigh Street (NUS HQ).\nWe can't send delegates to NUS conferences.\nNUS doesn't officially represent us in their\ndealings with the Government and other\nnational bodies (although they would claim\nthat we still 'benefit' from their negotiations).\nLet me deal with these one at a time.\nFirst, reciprocal agreements: this is a tangible benefit, but not one which greatly\naffects many students. (In fact the main\nlosers are colleges like Chelsea who can't use\nour more extensive facilities). Second, NUS\ninformation: much of this consists of\ncampaign literature, e.g. anti-nuclear power,\nCND, unemployment, anti-apartheid, etc. But\ninformation on these issues is readily\navailable from national organisations which\nimportant of all in these negotiations, they\nhelped to stop the introduction of the loan\nsystem which would have caused many\nstudents great hardship (By using a survey\nthey conducted in European countries where\nthe loan system did operate, they managed to\nconvince the government that the system was\ntoo expensive to run, and too difficult to\nmanage.) This was a very important\ncontribution to student welfare. Other recent\ncampaigns from NUS have included overseas\nstudents, attempts to stop students paying\nhigh prescription charges and marches\nagainst unemployment (about one fifth of all\ngraduates are unemployed on leaving\ncollege). At the moment it appears that the\nNUS legal advisors have found a loophole in a recent rent act which could allow students to\nget rent rebates even if they live in halls.\nWe have seen that NUS can be an effective\ncampaigning body but much more is\navailable than this. Endsleigh Insurance\nwhich provides a specialist insurance service\nfor students was set up by NUS and though\nnot totally controlled by them now, there are\nstudent board members and the company\nprovides good insurance for halls of\nresidence, mopeds and motorbikes, rag\nweeks and concerts. A National Student\nTravel Organisation was set up by NUS but\nthis collapsed due to mismanagement.\nHowever it still persists to a degree in the\nform of London Student Travel. Without NUS\nthere would be no London Student Travel\nOrganisation. Student rail cards were\npion eee red by NUS who also introduced to\nthe UK. ISIC cards (International Student\nIdentification Cards) and the National\nDiscount Scheme (which gives varying\ndiscount at many thousands of stores around\ncollege societies (and individuals) can\ncontact directly. And however laudable one\nmay or may not find these causes they are\nhardly student issues. Neither have IC\nstudents ever shown much interest in being\nin any campaign, be it student related or not\nSome of the information NUS sends out is\nuseful, but it is easily obtained elsewhere.\nNUS merely passes it on, they receive no\nprivileged information.\nNUS conferences: not sending delegates to\nthese is hardly a great blow to the average\nstudent, although it does deprive four or five\nhacks a biannual chance to attend a four-day\nhack-in, hotel included, at the Union's expense. Lastly, representation: does NUS\nreally represent anyone other than the\npolitical activists who attend its conferences?\nIts grant \"negotiations\" are a failure. Since\nNUS started making demands for grant\nincreases in 1962, the real value of grants has\nfallen by 30%. This is because all governments\nrealize that NUS is not representative of its\n1.2m \"members\". A more moderate line than\nthat which is usually taken would probably\nmeet with far greater success.\nThere are many more arguments one could\nuse against NUS: its unrepresentative nature,\nits party political basis, its often extreme\npolicies, its bureau rc racy, its failure to run its\nservice companies via bly. Here I have\nconcentrated on the issues within college as\nthey would affect every student. I think I have\nshown that there is no real benefit to be\ngained from NUS membership, certainly not\ncommensurate with the huge expenditure\ninvolved.\nMartin Taylor\nExternal Affairs Officer\nthe country). The cheap student deals with\nNational Coaches were also negotiated by\nNUS.\nWhat are the arguments for staying out of\nNUS? The letter written to FELIX last week by\nChris Webb gave only one important reason\nfor staying out, and that was financial. NUS\ndoes seem at first glance to be expensive but\na closer look shows this to be a mere \u00a33.50\nper member. This is not too much to pay for\nall the NUS negotiating services and other\nadvantages given by NUS membership. We\ncertainly managed to find the money when\nwe were members a few years back. I am sure\nthat though the amount is large, it could be\nfound without a great deal of hardship (and\nthat a concentrated attempt to find a way\naround the NUS block affiliation fees could\nprove fruitful). However attempts to find the\nmoney will not take place because the real\nreason for N USd is affiliation was not\nfinancial but political.\nOne of the main points put forward as part\nof the opposition to NUS is that the executive\nmembers are left wing politicans and NUS is\nheavily involved in left wing politics. It is true\nto say that most executive members are\nelected on left wing labels but they are\nelected, and this is the important point; and\nwhen elected they work on student matters\nand not for the world revolution. It really\nwould not make much difference if an NUS\nrep was in the \"Kermitthe Frog\" party as long\nas he could negotiate well on student affairs.\nIn conclusion, we do need a national union\nand NUS is our only option and is a good\noption. At the moment we gain advantages\nfrom NUS and contribute nothing. We can sit\nback as Chris Webb implies in his letter and\nsay \"I'm alright Jack\" but without NUS we\ncould well have had a student loan system,\ngreater cuts in education, as well as smaller\ngrant increases. For how long are we to\nremain parasites sucking the backs of NUS,\nsimply on the grounds that we think they're a bunch of lefties? If we think things are\nwrong let's go and change them from within.\nPhilip B. Nathan\nAn appeal for re affiliation Page 6 FELIX, November 6, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "New opening hours for Haldane\nby Richard Williams, Haldane Librarian\nThere, are changes afoot in your friendly Haldane Library. From\nnext Monday, November 9, the Library will be open for reading on\nweekday evenings and on Saturdays. So if you want somewhere\nnice and quiet (and warm!) to settle down in a comfortable chair\nwith a good book on these dark, wintry evenings, then maybe this\nis the place for you. You could even write your essays there\nThe new opening hours are the same as those for the Lyon Piayfair\nLibrary: 9:30am to 9:00pm, Monday to Friday, and 9:30am to 5:30pm on\nSaturdays. So if you want that book or record for the evening or for the\nweekend, please come and borrow it from the Haldane Library counter\nMondays to Fridays between 9:30 and 5:30. In 1983 or 1984, all being well,\nwe shall be able to lend material at all times when the Library is open. So\nhave patience, please, folks....\nSo you've already found that our door next to the Great Hall is now\nfirmly locked against you? Cursing and gnashing your teeth, you now\nhave to go on safari through uncharted routes (well, no\u2014we've tried to\nsignpost you) and stairs to level two. Maybe you missed the library lift...?\nIf you're never in College in the evenings and if you're not one of the\nmany doing a Humanities course option, then probably you feel there's nothing in the new arrangements for you (especially if you live in Maths or\nPhysics). Probably not, except that you might be a little fitter with the\nextra lunchtime exercise involved in getting to us.\nMaybe you are in College in the evenings. Then the changes should\nsuit you well. Maybe you are doing a Humanities course. If so, then you'll\nfind that the changes have been made especially with your needs in mind.\nThe Humanities Short Loan Collection is now at the Counter of the Lyon\nPiayfair Library; it contains most of the titles recommended on your\nreading lists, with several copies of those most in demand. We are also\nbuilding up the stock of reference copies of these titles so that eventually\nthere will always be a copy in the Library to which you can refer\u2014this is\none of the things you asked for when we sought your views last year. So\nis the new loan period of three days, extendable if no-one is waiting for\nthe book. The Haldane Library also contains many related titles, for\nthose of you who wish to read further or for those unlucky enough to find\nall titles you want out on loan. The freedom of access between the two\nlibraries means that there is now more reader and working space\navailable to you\u2014the Haldane is so popular that we often haven't enough\nroom for everyone. Oh, and that locked door? An unfortunate and\ninevitable consequence of opening up internal access between the\nlibraries\u2014so long as there are people anti-social enough to deprive other\nmembers of the College of books which they need (perhaps desperately)\nby what is commonly and indelicately called theft, then we have little\nchoice. It really is in your interests, even though we may be hard put to\nconvince some of you.\nFor those of you who are new to the College and haven't yet\ndiscovered the delights we have to offer, a brief summary now, and a reminder to all our many users: we have a good collection of all types of\nfiction (Student Union property and selected by the Union Book Buyer),\ngeneral interest non-fiction on a wide range of subjects, Ordinance\nSurvey and other maps and atlases, and about ninety journals and\nnewspapers. There are two special collections of books: the H.G. Wells\nCollection, commemorating the College's most famous student, and the\nCorin Collection, a small collection of modern private press books. The\nMusic Library contains books and journals on all kinds of music and on\nhi-fi, music scores, and a very large collection of classical and popular\nmusic records and cassettes together with some spoken word recordings\nand language courses. You can get discount tickets for classical music\nconcerts through the Youth and Music organisation; the Music Librarian, Miss Cedric, is the local representative. She also keeps a list of\nmusicians in College interested in performing chamber music. We have a free \"small ads\" noticeboard\u2014sell your old stereo, your old car, your old\nmother-in-law (buyers not guaranteed) or find yourself a typist for your\nthesis or project (we have more advertisements from typists willing to do\nsuch work than anywhere else in College). We also have a number of\nlibrary exhibitions during the year. This year's programme includes\ndisplays of H.G. Wells and Imperial College (for the RCS Centenary), of\nrare books on the history of mining from the Robert Annan Collection\nand private press books from the Corin Collection, among others.\nIf you're worried that the changes mean that you can say goodbye to\nthe Library's pleasant surroundings, have no fear\u2014we value them too,\njust as we do the service we have offered as a sort of on-the-spot public\nlibrary to the College for many years. Neither are in danger of\ndisappearing. Changes in the College, and particularly the growth of\nHumanities courses, have meant that the demands on the Library have\ngrown and that the balance has shifted. If we are to meet these demands\nthen such changes are inevitable, unpopular though they be with some. I hope those people will understand that the changes have not been made\nlightly or without considerable thought by the Working Party which\nrecommended them, and that the aim remains to provide the best\npossible library service to the widest number of members of the College.\n1 9 Exhibition Road, South Kensington10% discount to Imperial College Union\ncard holders.

    "content": "Wing Tsun\nThe Chinese method of attack and self-defence was kept a secret handed down in\nChina from father to son, because of its deadly\npower to disable or kill.\nThe Chinese martial art of Kung Fu does not\nconsist entirely of aggression; it is far more\nthan that. It is a philosophy and a culture.\nThe basis of Wing Tsun Kung Fu is humility\narid self-respect. Should it be needed for self-defence the approach is to seek out opponents\nweaknesses and prevent him from attacking,\nnot to batter him to the ground. We attempt to\ninstil absolute self control and abandon such self-damaging attitudes as greed and\nhate.\nWhen a practitioner reaches the very\npinnacle of Wing Tsun, he is said to be free\nfrom any mundane rules, forms and regulations. He is a pragmatic fighter, elusive,\nun fixable and completely unpredictable. Wing\nTsun becomes an art of self-expression. t Mr Simon Lau who studied Wing Tsun Kung\nFu in HongKong thinks there are more\nimportant aspects to the art than the high\nkicking violence featured in many of Bruce\nLee's hit films. \"The one thing many young\npeople don't realise when they see Bruce Lee's films is that he was above average in strength\nand style. They think that they can achieve his\nstrength after a few lessons.\nKung Fu is a potentially dangerous art. If\ntaught by unqualified persons it can result in\nserious injury. Mr Lau is very concerned about\nthis and hopes that youngsters will take more\ncare in choosing their teachers.\nA division of Mr Lau's Wing Tsun Academy \u2022\nwas formed at Imperial College Union in his\nacademic year. Training takes place in the\nUnion Gymnasium on Wednesday between\n3:00 and 6:00pm and Saturday between 11:00\nand 2:00pm. Anybody interested in the art is\nwelcome to join.\nMethsoc\nDo you like ice cream? Good, because we're\nhaving an ice cream party in E450 Chem Eng\nat 12:40pm on November 11.\nWhy? Because we like ice cream. We being\nMethsoc, and honestly, I 've never seen a pink\ncocktail in my life.\nWe will also be having a short epilogue\nfollowed on Thursday lunchtime by a discussion with lunch, on some Biblical\npassages trying not to mention ice cream.\nAudiosoc\nFollowing his recent tour of Linn Products in\nGlasgow, our crusading Chairman is back\nleading the ranks of Audiosoc to renewed\nglory.\nThis very Tuesday (November 10) we have a subjective comparison between the following\ndecks:\nLogic/Helius/AT32\nLinn LP12/Rega/R100\nArista n/ SME/AD CZ LM Focus 1/Micro/Basik\nmodified AR super deck/ Syrinx/Micro L C80W in our usual an echo ic chamber, the Union\nUpper Lounge (beside ICU Office) starting at\n6:30pm.

The main event of the\nweekend was the World Cardboard Canoeing\nChampionships, which took place on a two\nhundred yard course, including the Serpents\nTail, one of the best rapids we have in this\ncountry. The IC entry was a three-man\nCanadian canoe, and as you would expect the\ncardboard engineering was of a high standard.\nWith the three cardboard is ts at the peak of\nphysical fitness our hopes were high.\nUnfortunately this was not to be. Despite an\nencouraging start, sogginess started occur ing at the later stages of the race, and cardboard\ncollapse happened just before the finish. This\nwas still an impressive entry though, as there\nwere only three finishes out of about twenty-five starters in the cardboard multi class event.\nThe weekend also saw some more normal\ncanoeing for both novices and experts on the\nRiver Dee. The novices were introduced to\nwhite w? ter on the scenic upper section of the\nDee, while those with more experience attempted the more difficult lower section to\nLlangollen, with varying degrees of success.\nAnyone interested in joining the club is\nwelcome to come and try the sport in the\nswimming pool between 6:30 and 8:00pm every Tuesday.\nICYHA\nWell, we finally made it to a hostel at last. (Our\nfirst attempt was foiled by a blown engine in\nthe van.) As the van was not quite ready for\naction we had to travel by train; the location\nbeing Arundel Youth Hostel set in the valley of\nthe river Arun and surrounded by the hills of\nthe South Downs. Arriving on Friday evening\nthere was just enough time for a quick drink\nand a bit to eat before returning to the hostel.\nOn Saturday we walked over the tops of the\nSouth Downs and through the autumn woodlands in the area. Sunday saw us going in\na different direction, walking down the\nsomewhat wet and muddy banks of the river to\nthe sea a few miles away, before returning to\nCollege by train in the evening.\nHaving successfully completed this weekend,\nwe should now have a full program for the rest\nof this term. Today a group of us are off to the\nChiltern hills for a weekend's cycling and next\nweekend, with the return of the van, we will be\noff to see the Cotswolds. Other destinations\nlater this term will be Snowdon and the\nYorkshire Dales. If you are interested in going\non any of these trips (cost around \u00a310) come\nalong to our weekly meeting in Southside\nUpper Lounge every Thursday from 12:30 till\n2:00pm. Community Action Group\nSoup runs again on Tuesday and Friday\nmeeting in Falmouth Kitchens at 10:30pm Anyone is welcome.\nIs anyone interested in helping with retarded\nand mentally handicapped children at a youth\nclub in Acton? The club is from 12:30 till\n4:00pm every Saturday. Come along this\nSaturday, meeting under Be it Arch at\n11:30am.

If anyone is interested\nplease contact Sean Coyle, Elec Eng 3, or\ncome to the Action Group meetings on Mondays at 12:30pm at the top of the Union\nBuilding and then we can organise day trips,\netc. See you sometime.\nThe RCS Centenary fortnight is getting close\nnow, so keep a look out for details and agendas. Most important of course is the Ball,\nwhich is on Friday, November 27. The price is\n\u00a328 for a double ticket, for which you get three\nbands, a whacking great meal, a disco and\ngallons of booze. Please don't wait until the last\nmoment to buy your ticket.\nAnyway, not much seems to be happening\nthis week, apart from the RCS Rag collection\ntomorrow. This takes the unprecedented step\nof using our house-to-house licences to collect\nhouse-to-house. See Broadsheet, etc., for\nmore details, but meet at 10:00am in the RCS Office. We're now \u00a3400 behind Guilds Rag\ntotal, so it's time to put in some extra effort!\nCity & Guilds\nOn Saturdays, we collected \u00a3640 for rag.

Meanwhile\nduring the wait, the B2's had \" borrowed\" two players. Consequently, a very fast\nrunning game was played with IC dictating\nthe speed of play. Charing Cross could not\ntackle fast enough to prevent six tries being\nrun in. Each try was the result of continued\nlooping, switching and support play between\nboth the backs and the forwards. The IC pack, although picking up good loose ball\nwere handicapped in the tight by not having\na recognised hooker. Only one of the six tries\nwas converted because again IC had no\nkicker.-It must be emphasised that it was a team\nperformance in which every member of the\nteam played rugby as it should be played.\nThe Charing Cross skipper summed it up in\nthe bar later \" Why don't more people play\nthird fifteen rugby?\"\nScorers: A.

The Fourths quickly\novercame the disappointment of last\nWednesday's defeat with an encouraging\nfirst-round Cup win at Royal Holloway.\nThe game started badly when, against the\nrun of play. Holloway scored two goals, but\nthis only inspired the Fourths to a greater\neffort. Dave M cP hail went close to scoring on\nseveral occasions and then, with the\ngoalkeeper beaten, a Holloway defender\ndesperately stopped the ball with his hands.\nRich Dolan' s shaking knees proved no\nhandicap as his crisply struck penalty kick\ngave the keeper no chance.\nAlmost immediately Holloway restored\ntheir two goal lead with a slick attack, but the\nFourths fought back bravely with goals from\nJohn Rigby and Dave Hardy. Just before\nhalf-time, Rich Heath inadvertently knocked\na low cross into his own net. but made\namends in the second half with an aggressive\ncontribution.\nHolloway rarely penetrated the IC back\nfour of Heath. Ch own, Savage and Kindred, who had indicated earlier his ball winning\ntechnique by tackling a lamp post with his\nhead.\nDave Gladman, Rick Dolan and Dave\nHardy prompted from midfield until John Rigby scored a well deserved equalise r. The\ngoal that clinched the tie came from Mick McNicholas when he curled the ball oxer the\ngoalkeeper from twenty-live yards.\nHolloway's final attempts to save the game\nwere foiled by solid defensive work and some\nexcellent goal keeping by Andy Slater.\nTeam: Slater, Savage, Heath, Choun, kindred,\nCladman, Hardy. Dolan, McPhail, Rigby,\nMi. \\ i cholas. ft Hockey\nLadies\nOn Saturday, October 31, in the first round\nof the UL Cup, IC certainly earned their 5-4\nvictory over Guys 1. With only nine players\nagainst ten we were soon very tired and were\nunder a lot of pressure from their forwards,\nwho were very organised in the first half.\nHowever, a couple of shots from Alison Crumb ie meant we went 2-1 up until our\ncaptain levelled the score by a nicely placed\nhome goal.\nOur defence was much improved at the\nstart of the second half and our third goal\ncame Irom the centre hall, Sara Hal bard, as a result of a coordinated move with the\nforwards. Guys pulled it back to three all, but\ntwo more attacks made it 5-3 to IC, the two\ngoals coming from Karen Barnett. By this\ntime there was still twenty minutes of play\nleft and both teams were very tired. Guys\nwere determined to win and made it 5-4. The\nfinal minutes saw our goal under a lot of\npressure but some brilliant keeping by\nAlison Coates and defence work by the backs\nmeant we held our lead to make the final\nscore 5-4.\nMany thanks to the whole team for putting\nin so much effort.\nTeam: A. Coates, A. Crumbie, S. Halbard, C. Brown, C. Walker, J. Birbeck, M. Buchanan, R. Mason, K. Barnetl.\nFirsts\nIC soon went down to a well taken goal by\nthe opposition. Under considerable pressure,\nwe conceded another goal due to an error by\nthe goalkeeper. Fortunately, an excellent\ngoal by Bansal reduced the deficit to one goal\nat half-time (despite John Clarke's efforts to\nput the ball into his own net).\nIn the second half, the Firsts looked good\nenough to equalise, but N PL managed to\nsnatch another goal from a short corner. Our spirits were lifted briefly as Bansal again\nburied f he ball deep into the opposition's net.\nN PL gained their final goal after a lucky\ndeflection wrong-footed the defence.\nTeam: Butler, Coatesworth, Riley, Franklin,\nParker, Clarke, Rao, Cray, Ayers, Bell, Bansal,\nBaleson.\nSeconds\nThe day got off to a bad start, with the\nseconds sniggering at their captain's inability\nto remember where he had left the shirts.\nHowever, once this problem had been sorted\nout, after scouring hall of West London, the\nteam made it to Teddington without further\ntrouble. At this point, the team's confidence\nin their leader dropped still further as a 'short\ncut' to the sports ground ended up at a ten\nfoot high wire fence.\nIn the match itself, goalkeeper Roll Slatter,\nplaying like a cross between Evel K nei vel and the Kirov Ballet, kept us in the game\nwith a series of brilliant saves. Despite brave\ndefensive work, the team conceded its usual\ngoal just after hall time. The match then\nfollowed the familiar pattern lor this season\nwith IC totally dominating i he opposition\nwithout creating any clear-cut chances, and\nfinally conceding a second goal to an N PL breakaway. Despite the fact that their captain did something to salvage his\nreputation by actually getting a shot on\ntarget late in the game, the team never really\nlooked like pulling back the two-goal deficit.\nThanks are due to Andy Whitehead lor some\nexcellent umpiring and to Pete Hughes for\nkeeping quiet!\nTeam: Slatter, Ramplon, Pilkethley, Bird,\nRoessink, St roomer, Garms, Hughes, Farmer,\nWylie, Makers.\nThirds\nIC Thirds put up k valiant display of\nexhaustion xt the end of a tiring 9-1 defeat,\nevery member Tri air aged to down at least one\npint just to-shoW'now tired they were. Despite\nthe score line it was a good performance by IC, who played with three players missing in the\nfirst half, managing to keep the score down to\n3-0. In the second hall TC gained a player but\nhaving run so much in the first hall, creating\na couple ol scoring chances, they were unable\nto match the opposition who went on to score\nanother six goals. IC scored a consolation\ngoal through Ed, this was most amusing as\nonly Ed knew what was happening with the\nopposition standing still.\nTeam: C. Jones, S. Williams, T. Stocking, B. Shindler, E.

There were thousands ol people lining the route to watch all the old cars, and even some mad cyclists, attempt the fifty-six miles to Brighton. About three miles from the start, Bo stopped because Phil, the driver, had been\nunable to engage fourth gear.\nA little bit of investigation under the bonnet and ll o or boards showed that the car would be restricted to three\ngears lor the rest ol the run \u2014 I thought that this was ironically lair, because I only had that many on my bicycle.\nContinuing southward, we were in convoy with Derrick, which was surrounded by the posse of motorbikes, supposed ly lo protect him from cars;\nthey headed off alter a while. Somewhere near Croydon a I large fire engine, adorned with scientists, joined us and a certain amount of' lighted hearted repartee' took place\nbetween the two factions.\nA little bit before Ga twi rk some other cyclists from a cycling club, rather than IC, followed Bo with me for a lew miles until wc stopped at a garage and the crew had another poke al the engine\nand decided that they still\ncouldn't gel it to st av in fourth gear. A certain amount ol sandwich swapping ensued\nwith the people in Bo's support car( which li ad also\nstopped), until we all hit the road again \u2014 they were not intending to stop at all until reaching the promenade in Brighton. There is a hill near\na small village called Peas\nPottage which can do nasty\nthings to veteran cars, there\nwere several such vehicles at\nthe side of the road waiting lor their radiators to cool down; I was hoping that Bo would crawl up i he hill and give me a chance to get ahead, but no. they stormed up and I only just managed to\nkeep within a couple ol hundred yards of the remarkably lively (almost) octogenarian. A lew miles further on, while I was in my favorite\nposition just behind Bo's near side rear mudguard, when the passengers in the car spied a familiar looking pair of coaches, to which we waved vigorously \u2014 at least il made up for all the other coaches that we'd waved at. Going up the last long hill I was lee ling rather cream(' tae ke red and let Bo draw further and further ahead. Somehow I made it over the top and coasted towards the sea. almost falling asleep at\nthe handlebars. At the town boundary checkpoint( which is the official completion ol the run/( I asked an RAC official who told me that I was thirteen minutes behind Bo.1 finally\ngot lot he sea-front alter just\nunder four hours cycling \u2014\ndespite not having top gear.\nBo took an hour less than last\nscar.

Eventhough IC were under heavy pressure in the li rst ten minutes ol the game,\nwe were the first to score, through a dropped goal by J. Symes.\nEven though, for the first time this season\nwe had a proper referee, it didn't seem to\nmake much difference apart from the amount\nof times we were penal is ed in the line-outs.\nAs in all of the matches this season the\ndefence was very good. Credit must go to the\ncentres and the back row, who were always\nthere when they were needed.\nThe lin al score was 26-0, thought it should\nreally have been more.\nThe points were scored by: J.

Imperial looked far\nsuperior to their opponents and the second\nset followed almost as quickly, the score being\n15-8. Tottenham managed to raise their\ngame at the start of the third set however,\nand some sloppy play by Imperial allowed\nthem to take a71 lead. After a time out,\ncalled by Captain-on-Court P. Rouge, IC backed themselves up and after a great\nlight back narrowly lost the set 15-12. In the\nfourth set IC reasserted themselves to win158 and so finished three sets to one winners.\nThanks to Lech lor refereeing and Silvana\nfor scoring/supporting.\nTeam: P. Walker, A. Green, P.

He completed the\nmuddy five and a half mile course in a staggering twenty seven minutes ii l teen seconds to win easily by forty to fifty yards.\nPerhaps even more important is the fact\nthat we had a magnificent turn out of sixteen\nrunners including, for the first time, a ladies\nteam. These people make the team just as\nmuch as the winner and just as in previous\nyears, with the wins of Steve Kirk and Evan Cameron, this result will surely improve the\noverall standard of the club.\nOther creditable performances came from\nAndy Britton in the mens race (34th) and\nSarah Pearson in the ladies (ripping the field\napart to come 17th). A special thanks also to\nNicola who, despite cycling all over London\nfirst, came a creditable 31st.

From its format, I imagine I maybe receiving other copies of it. The Chairman of the UGC made very clear in the letter to' The Times' recently that in fact there was going to bean expansion in both the quantity and quality of science and engineering in higher education, in contradistinction to your letter. I acknowledge that, while there is significant expansion of a sizeable number of institutions, the UGC have decided, for their own reasons, to make cuts at the universities you quote, though my understanding is that those cuts have partly arisen because, while you describe them as technological universities, a reasonable proportion of their work is in other subjects and with very low entrance requirements. It is understandable that the institutions concerned have publicised their dismay, but it is quite wrong to gather from it that the UGC are cutting back on science and engineering, when in fact they are doing the opposite. Though I have had representations from Kings and the City University about the UGC decisions, I have had no representations at academic level from Imperial College and Iam, therefore, taking the initiative of raising with Lord Flowers the points you make in order to see the College's official reaction.

    "content": "What\na riot!\nMr Jonathan Rosenh'cad, from\nthe British Society lor Social Responsibility in Science, discussed the technology of riot\ncontrol with the Socialist Society\non Tuesday.\nInitially, Mr Rosenhead talked\nabout riots in Ulster, especially\nthe use of rubber bullets by the\nsecurity forces. A specimen at the\nmeeting was \"as hard as a cricket\nball\".' However, as time progressed,\nhe claimed that its effectiveness\ndecreased as protesters knew when\nit would be used. This fact. Mr Rosen head said, allowed the\nArmy to introduce plastic bullets,\nallegedly causing seven deaths so\nfar this year. Condemning plastic\nbullets he humorously quoted\none expert as saying \" the ideal\nweapon would be marshmallows\ndelivered by parachute\".\nMr Rosenhead saw the government as gradually eroding civil\nliberties. He argued that it was\nessential for the security forces to\nbe seen to be governing by consent. The reality, he said, was\neither that militants alone were\nwounded or that random injuries\nwere inflicted on a crowd. The two hundred policemen of the\nSpecial Patrol Group, for exam-ple, were seen by the speaker as a riot squad in all but name.\nStaple\nDiet\nClaims that College meals are\ndeficient in vital iron were\ndisproved last Friday evening\nwhen L instead resident Sue England found a4'/L, cm staple\nembedded in the surface of a pear\nat lire hall evening meal. Having removed the object. Sue went on\nto eat the pear, part of the fresh\nActual size!\nfruit dessert following a sickening\nmain course of baked ham and chips. The pear was apparently\ntough skinned, but juicy.\nGood start\nfor Cypriot\nSoc\nFollowing a passionate appeal in\nlast week's F'ELIX for 'Cypriots\nto unite' a meeting took place in\nthe Southside Re fee tory on Tuesday, November 2, to organise a society.\nAlthough between twenty and\nthirty signatures were received,\ndenoting these people's support\nlor the formation ol such a society. About fifteen turned up\nfor their inaugural meeting.\nThe occasion was somewhat\ninformal, in la et matters were\ndiscussed over lunch. Although\nthey had not, as yet, formed a committee, it became very clear\nthai there was no lack of leaders hip potential amongst them. Following in the tradition of Mediterannean emotionalism a very active and enthusiastic discussion took place in which all\nparticipated. Of the subjects\ndiscussed was firstly the need for\na Cypriot society. They believed\nthat although the Hellenic Society was very good it did not\neater for the special needs ol\nCypriots with Armenian, Turkish,\nor English origins, and it is for\nthese people that the society is\nprimarily directed. The formation of a constitution was also\ngiven considerable debate and this debate was to be continued\nat their first general meeting.\nAlter having observed them for\nabout one hour one can only\nconclude that they are very enthusiastic about forming their\nsociety and indeed from the issues\ndiscussed they have a great deal\nto oiler to the cultural life of the\nCollege, given a chance! And considering the somewhat muted\nactivities of certain other societies\none can only oiler them wholehearted support and encouragement in their sincere desires to\nform a useful and active society.\nSTOIC ask\nAspel\nMichael Aspel, the TV and radio\npresenter, was interviewed by\nSTOIC on Wednesday. During the twenty-minute interview he\ntalked of his career from leaving\nschool and becoming a publisher's tea-boy to the present\nwhere he is a media 'commodity'.\nThe interview was the first to\nbe recorded b v STOIC since the\n1 9 7 9 / 8 0 session, and will be\ntransmitted in about three weeks'\ntime. Michael Rod d{ Tomorrow's World), and Andrew Gardiner\n( formerly ITV) will also be\ninterviewed by STOIC this v ear. Laithwaite in spin again\nIn the case of the Establishment vs Professor Eric Laithwaite the\nprofessor seems to be winning hands down, on the evidence of\nTuesday's lecture to the Astrosoc. He kept a large audience enthralled\nas he, in his own words \" Put disturbing thoughts into their heads\".\nThe lecture, more properly a demonstration, as lectures imply\ntheory, which he regards as a necessary evil, was titled 'Gravity, Mass\nand Inertia', and centred around the so-far unexplained properties, an\nimpressive array of which he bad brought with him. Being Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering, he naturally\ncompared these effects with his most famous brainchild, the linear\ninduction motor. The results rendered an audience of scientists\nspeechless\u2014not the least of his achievements.\nProfessor Laithwaite's approach was informed, clear and frequently\nhumorous. He cheerfully destroyed fundamental concepts with su j ch statements as \"'The Vector product is only a highly suspect aide-memoir e.\" and in proving this he showed that his distrust of theory\ndoes not stem from any lack of ability in that direction on his part. He considers himself to be following in the footsteps of Faraday, whom he\nsees as the greatest scientist of all time, dismissing Einstein as \" A crazy,\nmixed-up kid, who will be lucky if his name appears in a single physics\nbook a hundred years from now\". Such statements do not seem so heretical when the laws of classical\nmechanics have just been found wanting before your eyes. However,\nhis attitude that \"the right answer never justifies incorrect means\" has\ndrawn criticism form some quarters ever since his controversial\nChristmas lectures, alter which the press claimed \" Lai thwaite says\nNewton was wrong\". He denies this; it is merely that Newton's laws of\nthemselves do not explain such effects as apparent loss of weight and\nenergy in flywheels.\nIt is said that a scientist is a man who can predict experimental\nresults l rom established formulas, while a genius observes experimental\nbehaviour and then derives the theory. Certainly, Newton and Faraday both worked on that principle, and Professor Laithwaite\nseems to be firmly on the same track.\nEXEC VIEWS\nDoes anybody read this waffle? If so please take note of a small\nmisconception some of you are under. I discovered this when compiling\nthe results of the refectory questionnaire (more of that when I have all the\ndata). Union income does no t sub sid is e refectories and never has.\nFurthermore, any subsidy which did exist is being removed over the next\ncouple of years as UGC( ultimately Treasury) money is taken out of\nrefectories. This will not only happen here but in all universities and even\nat the Royal College of Art which many of you seem to use (with good\nreason). Just one more reason for a campaign against education cuts.\nOn the subject of the RCA, the Deputy President of their student\nunion has written to me about the use of their refectory. IC students are\nwelcome, but not before 1:00pm at lunchtime as their own students must\nuse it between 12:00 and 1:00pm due to their timetables. They do offer a bar and a coffee bar (with real coffee at 12p and a selection of teas) for\nuse between 12:30 and 1:00pm. Please follow their request, we do not want to lose use of their\nrefectory altogether.\nNick\nFELIX, November 6, 1981 Page 3\n\n"
