    "content": "Dear Slevie Baby\nAt Bernard Sunley we were\namused to see the letter from all\nthose important people in Selkirk\nHall( FELIX585). Perhaps some of them want\nICU posts next year?\nNote the sentence: \" Which is\nworth more: the wellbeing of\nstudents catered for by the\nspecial, personalised social environment of these halls, or a lew thousand pounds in rent?\"\nWe find this Pass mori an disregard for the sanctity of\ngreenbacks very touching, especially among people training\nfor not-very-special, impersonal,\nanti-social jobs in industry.\nTo preserve their innocence,\nwe feel it is only fair to oiler them\nLuigi( our warden). We hardly\never see him anyway, and when\nwe do we can't understand a blind word he says.\nWe would rather have the few\ngrand: a) to renovate our slum;\nb) to pay off the ^200 plus in lines\nwhich Herr Tequilla has meted\nout in order to make us like him.\nYours in charily\nHouse 44 Hit Squad\nDear Sir\nIt is our opinion that the\nmerging of Selkirk/ Ti zard and\nKeo gh Falmouth Halls would\ndestroy their potential to provide\na supportive and stimulating environment.\nAs we see the proposal one\nwarden( instead of two) supported by a sub warden in each\nunit will be overseeing nearly 200\nstudents. Inevitably the attention\nreceived by each unit will be\nreduced. In return two penthouse\nHats will be available for rent and\nsix rooms previously allocated as\nwardens' places will be available\nto students in the normal way.\nSupposedly less students will have to commute from home or\nlive in 'crummy' beds its. However,\nwe feel that hall will become a less desirable place in which to\nlive.\nMany aspects of hall life will\nsuffer and we would like to\noutline why they are so valuable\nto preserve.\nThe hall's small size makes it\npossible for the warden to know\neverybody and to be aware ol\ntheir individual needs as they\nrespond to the strains of College\nlife. He is also readily available lo\nadvise, being familiar with many\naspects of College \u2014 far more\nthan a sub-warden, who being a student, does not have the\nexperience.\nMany social events currently\norganised wit li the warden's guidance and encouragement\nwould be impractical lor a large\ncombined hall. Selkirk not only\norganises hall social events but\ncontributes actively lo College\nRag with all oat in the Rag Procession, stalls at the Fete, etc.\nStudents In a large hall would\ncertainly feel less commit t ment lo\nsuch ventures. Alternatively, is\nthe warden to be expected to do\ntwice the work, with different\nactivities in each unit? We suggest one warden will not\nhave time to do the hall justice.\nMore pressure and responsibility could be placed on the\nsub wardens; or will their numbers\nbe increased, hence reducing the\nnumber of rooms available and\ngains in rent.\nA hall like Selkirk thrives on\ncommunity spirit, where every-body's part is significant and\ninvolvement is encouraged, be it\nin social events or at community\nmeetings where all residents may\nair their views. (At a recent\nmeeting they voted unanimously\nagainst the proposal to merge the\nballs.) The alternative in a large\nball is a representative commit-tee, and we seen in College as a whole the dubious success of such\nan indirect approach.\nWithout such an environment,\nwhich we suggest arises Irom a small community where the\nwarden's close involvement is\npossible, the quality of life in hall\nwill plummet. Southside will contain merely hostel type rooms.\nTo subject nearly 400 students\nto life in \" dead\" halls al a College with little enough of a supportive atmosphere, to save\nperhaps6 students a daily journey, seems unjustifiable madness.\n) ours sincerely\nJ Atkinson, Hail Sec\nA Warby, Hall Treasurer\nCA Milner. Hall Treasurer19812 Helen Bolt. Acting Hall Sec,\n1981 2\nDear Sir\nAt a recent U GM, May2 G. the\nmotion discussing the merging ol\nTi zard and Selkirk Halls was not\nheld owing to the meeting being\nin quo rate. I should like to make a few comments about the way in\nwhich this matter has been dealt\nWith.\nTo a nonmember of the\nStudent Residence Committee it\nappears that the whole issue has\nbeen discussed with a minimum of consultation, so as to get the\nmerger fixed without causing trouble. This cav iller attitude is\nindefensible, surely those most\nexperienced in Hall life should be\ngiven first say in matters which\naffect them most directly. On Thursday's edition of STOIC, Mark Clegg (a member of S RC) claimed to have consulted members of Willis Jackson House\nabout the proposed changes in\nHall accommodation. With all\nrespect, lie is failing to do his job\nproperly if these are the only\npeople he consults.\nIn a discussion following the\nU GM, both Rich Archer and\nMark Clegg said that the views of\nstudents outside Hall had also to\nbe considered. I fully except this\nviewpoint, however, if the social\nlife of a Hall is to be jeo podi sed in\nexchange lor an uncertain gain in\nextra places, then surely the\npresent residents have a useful\nrole to play in such a decision.\nFinally I should just like to ask,\nwhy if the present arrangements\nfor Hall work, do they have to be\nchanged.\n) ours faithfully\nAT Smith\nDear Ed\nAfter the success of the Physics\nOpen Day (Fiasco) on Friday,\nMay15, I should like to thank\nboth members of stall for providing tours around their research\ngo ups, and the students who\nhelped during the Day.\nfour relieving Dtp Rep\nMark Gillett\nSit\nYour current campaign against\nJohn Passmore is disgraceful.\nSome of the things you have\nalleged in it are tantamount to\nsuggesting that not only is he\nICU President, but that he was\ninvolved in a shady deal concerning rape alarms, he cheated in his\nsabbatical election campaign, squandered \u00a3 5 0 0 of Union money without a second thought,\nhe is regularly drunk in the\nUnion Bar, he's Irish, he's an\nineffectual organ of the Rector's opinion, he's a lousy president,\nand he doesn't deserve a LJGA..\nAll these charges are as\nunjustified as they are scandalous. Mind you, I couldn't help\nlaughing.\nPettifogger Jarnoyce, BSc\nDear Sieve\nWhilst I realise not too many\nstudents will have found the time\nto wade through the small print\nof last week's supplement, it was\nmost disappointing to find neither you, nor one- of your\nminions had bothered to do so\neither. As I was reading Miss\nLindsay's report I found myself\ndistracted by the incredible number of typesetting errors.\nThe other two reports being only\nslightly better. This year, FELIX has managed to attain a very\nhigh standard in its production\nand it is a pity that you have\nall o owed it to slip even this\none ee.} ours\nRuth Hildebrand\nEd's Note\nDear Ms Wildebeest\nDo you not think it unwise for\nsomeone as fat and horrendously\nugly as yourself to dare criticise a person so unfairly vindictive as\nmyself?\nTo answer your point: I, and\nmy minions, found ourselves\ndistracted by text so incredibly\nboring that our proofreading efforts were directed to pastures\nmore pleasant.\nYou are correct to point out\nthe high standard of production\nmaintained in this year's FELIX bul I must confess that I was\ngenuinely surprised that a person\noi such low intelligence would\nhave noticed. I stand corrected.\nHowever, do not take the trouble to write another petty,\nnitpicking letter to this organ\nagain\u2014unless you want me to\nprint a picture ol you with no\npanties on. that is! Furthermore,\nhow dare you be so presumptions\nas to address me by my Christian\nname. What's wrong with \" Sir\"? Dear Sir\nI was quite annoyed to read\nMr GO 'Reilly's letter in last\nweek's FELIX in which he refers\nto the \"legitimate desire of the\nIrish people for a united co un try\". He must mean the desire of\nthe Eire Government because he\nappears to be totally unaware of\nthe fact that a large majority of\npeople in Northern Ireland wish\nto remain part of the UK. It is\nun lor tuna te the views of the\nUnionist politicians are not as\nwell publicised as those of\nRepublican criminals. Despite\nsome rash behaviour (blown up\nout of al! proportions by the\nmedia), the Rev Ian Paisley has\nattempted to express the concern\nof the Ulster people but has time\nand time again been represented\nby the media as an extremist. He is trying to make Mrs Thatcher\naware of the Southern Governm ent despite anything Mr Haughey may say at summit\ntalks.\nPage 2 FELIX, May 29, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Social Colours, UGAs and the whole\ncharade\nCongratulations to Liz Lindsay on receiving\nher deserved Union General Award. I cannot,\nhowever, bring myself to congratulate John\nPassmore or Rachel Snee on theirs. Only last\nweek Ms Snee was expressing her desire to\nturn down aUG A if offered one (these days, a practice with more respect and honour attached to it than being thought fit to\nreceive one in the first place!) What a noble\nthought! That she would actually think of\nherself as undeserving of aUG A. No such\nluck! Ms Snee's reason was she had little\nrespect for John Passmore as President\u2014the\nman who awards such honours. However,\nSnee (two-faced as ever) would now lead us to\nbelieve that she has renewed her faith in Mr Passmore's abilities.\nRachel Snee has only two things going for\nher\u2014the fact that she voted against John\nPassmore'sUGA, and the size of her breasts.\nWhat of Passmore'sUGA? This is voted on\nI wonder how many of you remember Prong and\nQuirk, two of the lecherous mathematicians from\nPrimelia who appeared in this column last year?\nWell, following the mysterious and sudden\nretirement of several wardens recently, each of\nthem has been put in charge of two mixed halls of\nresidence. Primelia has four of these, all different\nsizes; the largest are Lizard and Foulmouth, and\nthe smallest Keyhole and Selclique. Prong has\nbeen put in charge of Lizard and Selclique and as\nsoon as he heard this he dropped in on the Senior\nWarden to find the percentage of women in each\nof the four halls.\nLater he met Quirk in the Queen's Legs.\n'You realise' he boasted 'that of the two larger\nhalls, mine has a higher proportion of women\nthen yours.'\n'What about the smaller halls?' asked Quirk.\n1 win again. Selclique has a higher proportion\nof women than Keyhole.'\n'It doesn't really worry me,' replied Quirk.\n'Next year your two halls will be amalgamated, as\nwill mine, and although there is to be no\nredistribution of women at all, my combined hall\nwill have a greater proportion of women than\nyours.'\nNow you may remember that Quirk is a statistician, and therefore is not totally truthful;\nand Prong is extremely doubtful about his last\nassertion. Is it possible that Quirk is telling the\ntruth? Or can Prong be sure he is lying?\nby Union Council and hence does not carry\nbehind it the stigma of having been awarded by\nan in com pet ant, lazy, good for nothing, drunk\nof an ICU President. However, Council with\nonly a few exceptions, are the biggest bunch of\negocentric, pseudo politico, nancy boy petty fogging tw at s that I have ever had the\npleasure of insulting. Not only do they crawl up\nthe College's arse hole on every matter from\nresidence to refectories, they have the gall to\npoke their heads out and shout \"Hey, chaps,\ncome on in, it's great!\"\nThey fail dismally to represent the students\nwho voted them \"into power\" and God-only knows why they think Passmore deserves aUG A. At this stage, let me tell you now that I'm bloody annoyed about this and I intend to rant\nand rave for a further few paragraphs yet.\nBored? Listless? Think I \"go on\" a bit to\nmuch? Then piss off as you probably haven't understood or cared about a single word I have written this year.\nMay I resume, what is aUG A? It's the\nhighest award doled out by the Union; all\nexcept for his own, at the President's discretion. Only four or five a year. It is\nawarded for ou standing contributions to the\nUnion.\nSome say John Passmore has done \"a lot\nbehind the scenes\" and \"only the bad things\nget reported\". In no uncertain terms \u2014\nbollocks! Speaking as a serious observer of the\nUnion, John Passmore arrives at the office\naround 10:00am, just in time for coffee. Then\nhe puts his feet on his desk and waits for Ruth\nHildebrand to trot up to the office. At this\npoint they pet for the rest of the morning.\nThen they have lunch together. Then they\nhave sherry from the Union Office's vast\nsupplies of sherry (all bought out of your\nUnion subscriptions folks!). Then they pet\nmore. John then signs a few forms, gets pissed\nin the Queen's and then goes to Residence\nCommittee where he is trampled all over due\nto his brain being fuddled by alcohol. (Then he\ngets more pissed in the bar and goes to bed.)\nIf this is the \"behind the scenes\" work, is it\nany wonder that \"only the bad things get\nreported.\" John Passmore has done nothing\nthis year which could be described as\nconstructive for the Union.\nIt is a mockery of the awards system and a disgrace to the small band of people with\nU GAs whom Mr Passmore will be joining.\nLikewise Rae Snee, who certainly could not be\ndescribed as lazy, but simply misguided by her\nown personal venom for the average student.\nI urge Passmore and Snee to consider\ncarefully just what aUG A means.\nWhat about social colours? Considering the\nbitterness, personal anxiety and bitchy backbiting these\" awards\" cause, Iam tempted to say scrap 'em. But so many\npeople seem to appreciate \"being acknowledged for the part they played.\" So touching!\nIf you've just been awarded them, what have\nyou got? Basically, an ugly black, yellow and\nwhite tie which if you dare to wear you get\nlabeled a poser, p seu d, or hack. (I 've only ever\nseen three being worn and the wearers would\nfit that description admirably.)\nThe only way to win in the social colours\nstreet credibility points game is to adopt a \"couldn't care less\" attitude. If you've just been\nawarded social colours, just remember that\nthere's always someone who's done more who\nhasn't got them and someone who has done\nless who has. Where does that leave you?\nWhile I'm trying hard not to cast aspersions\non individuals who get colours, I did notice one\nthing. No fewer than nine people received\ncolours for work on the IN COST Conference\nat Easter.\nWhile not wishing to criticise any of those\n\u2022n vol ved in this worthwhile venture I would say\nthat if they all did one tenth (counting Liz\nLindsay) of the work involved, none of them\nshould have received colours. I feel colours\ncommittee and Liz Lindsay (as chief organiser)\nshould have been more selective.\nEnd of outburst.

For the rest of you, however, a few\nwords of introduction will be in order. The\nPhoenix was founded in 1886 by HG Wells,\nwho at the time was a student at Imperial\nCollege. Since that time the magazine has\ntaken many forms, and the views and aims of\nits editors have varied greatly. Mr Wells would\ncertainly have approved of the philosophy of\nthe magazine over the past few years. The\naim has been to present original work by\nmembers of the College in the field of art\nrather than science; drawings, poems, stories\nand articles of general interest, as well as more\nobscure art forms, have all been included. This\nyear's offering, edited by Sean Gi bl in, achieves this end admirably.\nThe magazine inevitably invites comparison\nwith last year's edition, but such comparisons\nwould be rather unfair. Although the magazine\nhas the same format (A4 ;size, glossy cover,\nwell printed on art paper, etc) the approach to\nthe selection of material is somewhat different.\nIt is noticeable, for example, that this year's Phoenix is a lot stronger on photographs and\npoetry. The poems include some real gems\n(Patrick Coil's \"Shall I compare thee to a pint\nof Guinness?\" for example) and a lot of\nthought and care has gone into their presentation and layout. It's nice to see an\noriginal HG Wells poem reprinted from an\nearly edition of The Phoenix; it's well worth\nbuying the magazine for that poem alone. It's a pity, though, that Mr Giblin did not see fit to\nreprint the original footnotes to the poem\u2014surely these were just as funny as the\npoem itself?\nThe magazine also showcases work by no\nfewer than four photographers, all of whom\nhave turned in some very nice work. It is the\nphotos in particular that justify the high quality\nprinting.\nUnfortunately, while the magazine scores\nover last year's in photos and poems it loses on\nprose. Dave Brit ton's\" Testimony of a Traveller\" is the only piece which stands out in\nthis category, the rest being rather un interest ing. However, there are a number of unusual\nitems which more than compensate for this\nfault. Ian Wieczoek's four page strip is worthy\nof mention as is the page of sheet music by\nBarney McCabe \"Brontosauraus Blues\". The\nexcellent use of artwork and the written word\nto complement one another, which is apparent\nthroughout the magazine, is best ty p if is d by\nthe incorporation of a Scaramouche chess\npuzzle into a drawing by Margaret Ramsey.\nIn summary, this year's Phoenix is worth\n50p of anybody's money. As with all such\nproductions, risks have been taken, and not\neverybody will like all the material. However,\nthis year most of the risks seem to have paid\noff. Buy one and find out for yourself.\nDave J ago\n5SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS S IC Union Duplicating/Postal Services\nAs from June 1 all material bought from the\nUnion Duplicating Services has to be paid for\nin cash. Cash also has to be paid by clubs and\nsocieties using the Union postal facility.\nHowever high the reputation of a student\nchoir, one never quite expects them to\nachieve their customary standard during the\nDamoclean summer term; this concert was an\noutstanding exception. For although impending exams had slightly reduced the\nsize of the choir, they had obviously been\nthoroughly rehearsed, and there was certainly\nno reduction in quality.\nThe first work performed was Handel's Dixit\nDominus, a spectacularly lively exultation of\npraise (is romp too irreverent a word?) with\nplenty of fast movements demanding the\nclear diction and rhythmic singing for which\nIC Choir is renowned. Sadly, the opening was\nrather strained, and the initial 'Dixit, dix it Dominus Domino me o' lacked the punchy\nattack it needed; but the choir quickly warmed up and were well on top of the later\nmovements, even at the literally breathtaking\nspeeds Eric Brown took them at.\nAfter the interval (I thought the purpose of\ncoffee tokens was to shorten queues) came\nMendelssohn's Second Symphony, a great\nsurprise to anyone who, like me, always assumed\nMendelssohn started his symphonic output\nat No. 3. In fact, most of the audience seemed\nquite unfamiliar with the work, and it was a pity\nthere was so little written about it in the\nprogramme.\nThe symphony starts with three movements\nfollowing a more of less conventional pattern, but\nthe fourth movement takes the form of a short\ncantata beginning with, ending with, and generally\nbased on a short mot iv( Alles was Odem hat,\nlobe den Herrn) which recurred so often it\nseemed to be something of a joke among the\nmembers of the orchestra.\nSome of the choir were concerned lest they\nrepeat last term's mistake and exhaust themselves during the first half of the concert,\nleaving too little energy for the second. But the\nfirst three movements of the Mendelssohn\nobviously provided enough of a rest, and the\nLobgesang was presented with both the force and\nthe confidence it needed.\nMuch criticism has been aimed at the soloists in\nprevious choir concerts, but apart from the\ncounter-tenor who seemed to have some sort of\nfrog in his throat, these soloists did the choir great\ncredit. Among all the solos, I can't resist singling\nout Richard Frewer's beautifully moving 'Hiiter,\nist die Nacht bald h in?' But it was the choir's concert, and the choir\nwho made it a great concert. The tenors,\nnotably, produced a very fine noise, all the more\nremarkable since there were only eleven of them\n(I counted 'em). They also managed to avoid\nbeing swamped by the rather heavy basses, who\non one or two occasions hinted that they might\nhave been more at home in Cardiff Arms Park.\nThe gold medal, though, must go to the\nsopranos. \u2022 Dixit Dominus is a five-part work\n(SSATB) so there are only half as many sopranos\nsinging each line. As if this wasn't enough of a handicap. Handel rather un chivalrously makes\nthem sing a top B flat at every available\nopportunity. Admittedly the very first high note\nwas a struggle, but having gained self-confidence,\nthe sopranos went on to produce a sound of quite\nimpressive clarity and controlled power and they\nkept this up right to the end of the concert.\nIt was obvious from the prolonged applause\nthat the rest ot the audience had appreciated the\nperformance as much as I had, and wished to\nthank Eric Brown and the choir for a most\nenjoyable evening.\nMartin S Taylor\nSUB WARDEN ASSISTANT SUBWARDENS\nFALMOUTH \u2014 KEO GH HALL Applications are invited for the post of Subwarden\nof Falmouth/Keogh Hall Rent free accommodation in the form of a small self-contained flat is\nprovided. The essential duties of the post are to\nassist the Warden in the day-to-day running of the\nHall.\nIn addition, one or more Assistant Subwardenships may be available. These posts carry with\nthem rent-free accommodation in the form of a study bedroom in return for duties associated\nwith those of the Subwarden.\nThe posts require individuals who can display\nconscientious application, initiative, personality\nand responsible outlook.\nThe successful applicants for any of the above\nposts would normally be postgraduates, but applications from others will be considered on their\nmerits.\nApplications, including a concise but informative curriculum vitae, should be made to the Warden, Dr PW Jowitt, Department of Civil Engineering. The closing date is Wednesday, June\n10, 1981. A single application will suffice for both\ncategories of appointment.\nCricket\nIC v QMC (ULU Cup)\nELEVEN INTREPID cricketers and one bearded Welshman, travelling under the\npretence of being an umpire, set out on safari\nto Essex. With Flinstone's younger son Bam\nBam at the wheel the boys of the QM C could\nquite reasonably have expected a walkover as\nin the first round, when it took Guys over a day just to find the ground.\nHowever, having arrived at the ground our\ndriver and captain, D Everett, surpassed himself by losing the toss and IC were put in\nto bat on a wicket that resembled a wet\nsponge. Our captain not satisfied with losing\nthe toss opened the batting himself and gave\nus the solid start of 7 before being removed\nIbw. The entire IC middle order then followed\ntheir captain's example and IC were reeling at\n37 for 7. Then Goddard and Rook came\ntogether and our middle order batsmen were\nshown just how to score runs on aab sym al wicket. You use the edge of the bat not the\nmiddle. QM C fielders were thrown into utter\nconfusion and allowed IC to scrape 75 off 40\novers with Goddard left on 21 not out.\nAfter a resplendent tea, IC bowlers were\nprepared as usual to make up for the\ndeficiencies in the batting.\nJ Thomson arm steaming (at least tepid) in\nto bowl the first ball, which after being\ns nicked by the batsman was casually dropped by, you guessed it, Everett esq. With\nthe second ball, Thomson infuriated by his\ncaptain's inadequacies, had the batsman plumb Ibw and the trail of QM C batsman back\nto the pa villi on had begun. This trend was\naccelerated by the introduction of Slator's spin bowling? With a combination of long\nhops and full tosses QM C batsmen threw\ntheir wickets away in desperation. QM C were\nall out for 51 and the victorious 1st XI march\non in to the next round of the cup, looking\nforward to playing cricket and not water-polo\nin the next round.\nV Capt\nEd's Note\nThe handwriting on this article was appalling!\nNext time, type it or write neater or your\nreport won't be included.\nFELIX, May 29, 1981 Page 5\n\n"

If you think that you\nmight be interested in standing for any of these\nposts then feel free to contact any of us for a chat.\nThe papers will be taken down on Friday, June\n12 and there will be an AGM open to all PGs on\nWednesday, June 17 at 1:15pm to hear the results\nfor the first three posts and to elect the social\nsecretary and welfare officer.\nEnough of this official stuff. There will be a Ploughman's Lunch preceding the AGM. Tickets\nat \u00a31.00 will be available from the Union Office.\nThis promises to be a well attended event. So we\nhope that you will come and enjoy the\npenultimate (sob) PG Group event of this year.\nDavid Wood\nNATIONAL C ND are organising a train to\nGlasgow for the demonstration on Saturday,\nJune 6, so if you're bored with exams, come and\nhave a look round the submarine bases on the\nClyde. The train costs \u00a315 and leaves on Friday\nevening, returning on Sunday afternoon; tickets\nfrom Ian Heavens, Atmospheric Physics Group,\nHuxley Building. Despite a three month ban on\nmarches, Strathclyde police are allowing the\ndemonstration to go ahead, which is jolly kind of\nthem as we were going to march anyway.\nNearer to home, this Sunday sees the arrival of\nthe Liverpool and Bradford marches against\nunemployment, with a rally at midday at Hyde\nPark Corner followed by a march to Trafalgar\nSquare and speeches. C ND supports increased\nemployment in socially responsible ways as an\nalternative to labour-intensive arms industries, so\njoin us and welcome the Liverpool unemployed\non Sunday (meet 11:45am outside the Huxley\nBuilding, Queensgate).\nmi,:*'m Bookshop News\nEngraved Pewter Tankards\nWe now stock a selection of these tankards, all\nbearing the College Crest.

But unless action is taken now it\nwill also see the most vicious attack on the rights\nof the disabled in Britain for generations.\nThe attack comes from a committee chaired by\nin flu enc ti al Labour MP, Ms Renee Short. The\nShort Report (the second report of the House of\nCommons Social Services Committee on\nPerinatal and Neonatal Mortality) challenges the\nbasic human rights of the handicapped.\nGuinea Pigs\nFirstly the report wants research to be carried out\non unwanted handicapped infants \"of no\nparticular benefit to them and which may carry\nsome risk of harm\". This change in the law would\nmake these babies as expendable as laboratory\nanimals.\nPrice of Life\nThe report goes on to describe the savings that\ncan be made from avoiding the care of the\nhandicapped altogether. The Short Report puts\npressure on Area Health Authorities to screen all\npregnant women to detect handicapped babies in\ntime to abort them. The report states: \"In a high\nrisk area such as South Wales the annual savings\nfrom avoiding the care of severely handicapped\nsurvivors exceeds the annual cost (of screening)\nin the second year and every year thereafter\".\nThe Short Report shares the view of the Office\nof Health Economics whose booklet \"Mental\nHandicap \u2014 ways forward\" recommended\nscreening as the cheapest way of dealing with the\nproblem of disablement. By disposing of a handicapped person's life in this way it is\nestimated a saving of over \u00a3225,000 can be made.\nDangers\nThe Report has glossed over the dangers of mass\nscreening. The Royal College of Obstetricians\nand Gynaecologists remains opposed to mass\nscreening because of the high risks of mother and\nbaby. The procedure used, amniocentesis,\ninvolves inserting a needle into the pregnant\nwoman's womb and withdrawing some of the\namniotic fluid. In one study one in twenty-five\nwomen who had undergone amniocentesis\nsuffered serious complications. A letter in the\nLancet told of a thirty-five year-old woman who_ underwent the procedure in the sixteenth week of\npregnancy. Twelve weeks later, the mother\ndelivered a premature baby. The baby was so\nmalformed that he died four minutes later.\nAmniocentesis had revealed a perfectly normal\nchild but it had caused amputation of his limbs\nand severe injuries to his head and pelvis. Imagine\nhow the mother must have felt.\nError\nAnother problem is that the test is not very\naccurate. Twins can be mistaken for spina bifida\nand aborted in error. Similarly, it is not possible to\nassess the degree of handicap. An article in the\nNew Scientist reported that \"the human cost of\npreventing some 555 spina bifida births per year\n(by prenatal diagnosis and abortion) in England\nand Wales would be 120 dead or damaged normal\ninfants.\"\nLiquidation\nWhat the Short Report's recommendation will do\nif implemented will be to divide people in to two\ngroups, one with the right to live and the other\nexpendable. If that seems familiar, remember\nunder Nazi Germany the handicapped \"useless\nbread eaters\", were the first to be 'liquidated'.\nAlternative\nThere is an alternative. It is well established that\nthe incidence of mentally handicapped births is\nlinked to socio-economic and environmental\nfactors. Currently no research is being done to\nestablish why this is so. We want to make people\nat IC aware of Short's recommendations so that\nthey can make a positive contribution to the Year\nof the Disabled by standing up for the\nfundamental rights shared by us all, handicapped\nor fit, rich or poor, loved or unloved.\nFrank Rouseel and JP Stanley.\nPage 4 FELIX, May 29, 1981\n\n"

The cheering\ncrowds of loyal IC students were\nconspicuous by their absence.\nIt could be Her Majesty's last\nvisit to the building in its current\nIbrm, as there is a controversial\nplan to demolish the eastern\ngalleries and to erect a \u00a3l(>m'' ve storey block.\nYacht sold!\nIMPETUS, the IC yacht has\nbeen sold. It had a history of\nunmitigated disaster. When it\nwas bought several years ago it\nwas found to be defective and it\ntook six months for the repairs to\nbe completed. Yacht Club managed to run it aground in\nJuly 1979 (the rudder fell off) and\nthe In ion has been paying for its\nmooring at Gosport ever since. A survey discovered myriad faults\nand so it was put up for sale\nthrough a broker, and it's now\nbeen purchased for \u00a34,35Q by a private buyer.\nAGM INQUORATE!\nLast Tuesday ICU's Annual General Meeting was held in Mech\nEng 220. The meeting will probably be remembered for the\nlarge amount of time spent on procedural wrangles.\nThe meeting opened at 1:10pm with about 250 people present. Jon Firth took the Chair, and whilst the meeting was discussing the\nminutes of the last meeting, a procedural motion was moved to change\nthe or det of business, to consider a motion on Southside Halls next. Jon Firth refused to accept the procedural motion, but his ruling was\nchallenged. John Passmore ( ICU President) took the Chair, whilst the\nchallenge to the Chairman's ruling was discussed. The challenge was\ndefeated on a vote, so the order of business was left unchanged.\nJohn Passmore then gave his annual report. He was questioned on\nthe increases in residence fees. Mr William Cortazzi was particularly\ninterested to know what part of the 12% increase was for \" Capital Replacement\" and it transpired that the increase might be 8% if a College deal to buy a hall of residence fell through.\nAfter the President's report was accepted, a procedural motion was\nmoved to consider the motions on S CC finances and Southside next.\nJon Firth refused to accept it, so the meeting went through the\nrigmarole of a challenge to the Chairman's ruling. This was carried on\na hand count. However, Mr Duncan Suss ( FELIX Editor, 1977/8)\nasked that the last vote be retaken on a show of Unioncards (at which\nMr Suss subsequently successfully voted with his Accesscard-Ed.). This vote\nwas counted, and the challenge to the Chairman's ruling upheld.\nThe meeting continued to discuss the procedural motion to consider\ntwo motions next. This was passed. Immediately another change to the\norder ol business to consider the Byelaw changes next was proposed.\nThis was carried on the vote. Liz Lindsay then moved that the colours\nto stall be awarded next, and this was carried. Those receiving colours\nincluded Prof Sutton Pro-Rector, John Smith College Secretary,\nArthur Turner Financial Secretary (who was also awarded Union Life\nmembership), Malcolm Aldridge Financial Assistant, Martin Parsons\nRefectory, Tom Cottrell, Nat West Bank Liason Officer, Dave\nBurtenmaster Estates, Sue Telling Welfare Assitant, Maz Fellows\nFELIX phototypesetter operator, Caroline Waitt Nightline Coordinator, I Thomas Domestic Manager, Dr Ken Weale Union Senior Treasurer, Jen Hardy Smith Union Administrator and Pat\nBaker Union typist.\nAnnie Laethean was given aUG A for her work for the Union.\nU GAs were also presented to Lil Lindsay and Ms Snee. As Liz Lindsay\nwas about to present aUG A to John Passmore, William Cortazzi\nmoved an emergency motion to prevent all three Executive members\nfrom receiving U GAs, but this was not accepted.\nByelaw changes were then discussed. The first extended the grounds\nfor life membership of the Union, the second abolished I CW A, and the\nthird put the Entertainments Chairman on Union Council. These were\nall passed, and will now go to the Governing Body for approval.\nThe S CC grant claim motion was discussed. This was passed and the\nU GM instructed UFC( Union Finance Committee) to add the\nsubscriptions back to S CC's grant claim. The subscription had\npreviously been deleted by UFC. At this point Gordon Quartey successfully challenged the quorum,\nso the AGM closed due to in quo racy just after 2:00pm. The reports ol the Deputy President, Hon Sec, Returning Oili(er and other officers were not discussed. Thus, the Dep Rep elections and\nelections at the last U GM still have to be ratified. The reports will be\nbrought up again at the first U GM of next session.

    "content": "How can anyone in N Ireland,\nProtestant or Catholic, trust an\nE ire Government which has\nnever totally divorced itself from\nterrorists whom it quietly protects by refusing to sign the\nEuropean Convention on Terrorism and by not extraditing terrorists to N Ireland.\nThe real problem is the successful propaganda campaign\nby the IRA. This is assisted by\nthe Eire Government's actions\nand therefore attracts support\nfrom Americans who have more\nmoney than sense. The world's media are also continually \"getting it wrong\". It is time lor\nMrs Thatcher and Mr Adkins to\nput the Eire MPs in their place\nand pay more attention to the\nmajority in N Ireland rather than\nlistening to the whimpering s of\nMessrs Haughey. Blaney, etc.\nLoyalist paramilitaries have\nonly developed in response to the\nGovernment's none om mitte d actions in N Ireland. Mr O' Reilly overlooks the fact that most of the\nparamilitaries' actions are against Republican sympathisers\nand not against the security\nforces. But these loyalists are not\nwell armed and look to Britain to\nprovide the protection against\nthe IRA. The army are quite\ncapable of suppressing t he\nterrorists in NI if they were\nallowed to do so by Mrs Thatcher's Government.\nTo conclude, I must say that I do not condone any violence in\nUlster from either \"side\", but it\nis up to Mrs Thatcher to respect\nthe view of the majority of people\nin N Ireland and to take the\nnecessary action to dispel any\ndoubts about N Ireland's position\nin the UK.

However,\neven after the time lapse and an\nenormous amount of reflection, I still come up with the feeling that\nmy decision was the correct one.\nI have always believed that a President of a Union is there to\nrepresent the students ol the\nUnion and also equally as\nimportantly to take responsibility\nfor their actions. I still hold that\nbelief. The reason lor my resignation therefore must involve conflict with those beliefs.\nWhen I first heard of last\nweek's unsuccessful attempt on\nDavy my initial reaction was to\ndiscover who was involved and\ndiscipline them through Union channels. However I later found\nthat two members of the Executive had given their support to\nthe attempt. Furthermore a conscious effort had been made\nto not contact me lor fear I may\ndisapprove.\nI fail to see how I can be\nexpected to represent and be\nresponsible for an organisation\nwhich shows this contempt ol the\nPresident's views.\nIt is not the li rst time that lack\nof consultation has occurred and\nthe people involved were well\ninformed of the feelings expressed\nabove on the ii rst occurrence.\nIt was with great sadness\ntherefore, that I was left in the\nposition where the only option\nopen to me, if I was to stand by\nmy beliefs, was to resign.\nI would like to take the opportunity to oiler my sincere\nthanks to all those people who\nhave helped me during the year\nand supported me through the\ntraumatic period and to express\nagain my deep sadness at having\nto take this decision.\n3 burs\nRich Archer\nSmall Ads\n\u2022.75 Auto Colt Pistol\u2014price available\non request, totally incapable of firing:\nCrossbow\u2014Rapier Mk4.
