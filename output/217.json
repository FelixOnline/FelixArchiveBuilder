    "content": "10 FELIX\nSports Day\nLittle ToAttract\nSports Day was held on Wednesday, 5th May, at Hurlingham\nPark. After a non-existent National Anthem, the proceedings\nv/ ere started by \" the man in the\nred hat\" (to quote Mr. Jenkins).\nThere were no outstanding per-form ances, although the general\nstandard of performance was\nquite high. Bishop of C&G, completed the treble during the afternoon by adding victories in the 1\nmile and the steeple-chase to his\nwin in th^ three miles last term.\nC&G seemed to have a slight\nadvantage over R.C.S. on the\ntrack, but R.S. M. did very well in\nthe field events, notably the Pole\nVault and Javelin. The match was\nvery close the whole way, the final\nresult depending upon the last\nTug-of-War between C&G and\nR.S. M. In spite of combined\nR.C.S. and Mines vocal support\nin the latter, C&G won the event,\nand apparently the competition.\nLady Jackson, wife of Sir Willis\nJackson, head j of the Electrical\nEngineering Department, presented the cups ably assisted by\nNorman Price.\nFinal Result :\n1st City and Guilds College 138 pts,\n2nd Royal College of Science 137 pts.\n3rd Royal School of Mines 88 pts.\nUnderwater Club.\nDiving club\nenjoys warmer\nwater\nIn past years, the club has held\nEaster training dives in Great\nBritain, inevitably, bad weather\nand poor diving conditions have\nmeant that very little time was\nspent diving and only ama so ti hist could regard it as a pleasure.\nLast term the club committee decided that this Easter's dive\nshould be held in the Mediterranean.\nDespite fears that the new com-press or,1i rst promised for delivery\nlast August, might not arrive in\ntime, a party of twelve set out in\nthe club van on April 8th. Two\nprivate cars also went on the\ntrip, each taking three people.\nFour of the party were members\nof Cambridge University who\ntravelled on an exchange basis, to\nthe diving site at La Ciotat, midway between Marseilles and Toulon.\nThe club had hoped to use the\nvan to travel to nearby diving sites\nbut, almost on arrival, a crack in\nthe cylinder-head Opened up and\na replacement had to be flown\nfrom England. Sincere thanks are\ndue to Mr. F.G. Irving who\ntowed the equipment trailer to\ndiving sites with his Rover and\nalso collected the new cylinder\nhead from Marseille airport.\nKen West (left) encourages the R.C.S. Tug-of-War team seen here\noverpowering C.&G. The actual diving was superb.\nEven on the windiest days, underwater visibility was between 30\nand SO feet This is much better\nthan the best conditions in British\nwaters. The water was at so ten to\nfifteen degrees Fahrenheit warmer\nthan in Wales at Easter. A very\ngood site was found at Cassis ten\nkilometres along the coast. The\ndiver could step straight off dry\nland into thirty feet of water. In\nplaces there were fifty foot underwater cliffs honeycombed with\nsmall caves and teeming with life.\nIn nine days at La Ciotat, most\npeople had eight dives of up to\nhalf an hour. It had been hoped\nto do more than this but lack of\ntransport caused some time to be\nlost. A lot of colour slides were\ntaken and also some underwater\ncine film. It is intended to show\nthe films at a meeting open to the\nwhole college in the near future.\nAll those who went consider\nthat the trip was well worthwhile\nat a cost of only twenty pounds.\nA similar trip is being planned\nfor next Easter. R> L>yra ef.. IN TOUCH Kearns Achieves Results\nA little storm broke last Wednesday over the normally friendly\nbut ill-supported College Sports Day.\nThis year, the competition between the Constituent Colleges was\na very close-run thing and after several recounts C&G beat RCS by\n1 point. However, the result of the cross-country race (held at the U.L. Champs, in the Autumn Term) has during the past been included in\nthe Sports Day results, and would this year have given RCS victory\nby 3 points. But Mr. Kearns, President of Mines has been responsible\nfor a few sparks flying at this \" College event,\" which normally passes\nunnoticed outside the Athletic Club.\nAfter gate-crashing a meeting and getting no satisfaction (R.S. M. weren't informed in sufficient time of the X country) this industrious\ngentleman then \" cons \" Sadhvani into an appeal to the Sports Day\nreferee to delete the X country result from the day's events. The\nreferee (Mr. Cutcliffe) concurs and thus Kish has thrown away a cup\n(he probably doesn't give two hoots about it anyway) but those poor\ndevils who've pulled their guts out running up Parliament Hill for the\nglory of R.C.S., obviously take exception to all this underhand politics.\nKearns, really hadn'ta leg to stand on, R.S. M. didn't even have\nan Athletics Captain at the time of the X country, and surely the\ncaptains of the constituent athletic clubs should have been invited to\nsee Mr. Cutcliffe.\nStill, this little affair can't do any harm and besides being a giggle\nmay even help to bring reality to the pretence that Sports Day is a major College event.\nHockey\nBy E. Needham\nThe Imperial College Hockey\nteam entertained the Forward\nHockey Club of Gronigen, Holland during Easter week. The\nweek consisted mainly of entertainment with a dinner on the\nTuesday evening and celebrations\ncontinuing until the early hours.\nAlso l.C. played and beat the\nDutch ie am in a game at Harlington.\nHowever, both teams spent the\nEaster weekend at the hockey\nfestival at Lowestoft. Socially, of\ncourse, a success\u2014the Royal\nHotel treated the teams as res i dents, and are still regretting it.\nForward played 6 games and\nwon one. I.C. played 5 and won\ntwo. Outstanding in the I.C. victories were the forwards Hough,\nStenning and McKenzie. Outstanding in the defence was Stenning, who seemed to suffer from a drastic loss of stamina. Naturally;\nthe defence of Needham, Phillips,\nPeters and Castell remained firm\nand an inspiration to the rest of\nthe team. The fact that I.C. drew\nthe last two games surely indicates\nthe part these four have played\nin the team during the whole\nseason.\nThus, although the results were\nnot particularly natt e ring, this\ntrip was indeed an excellent finish\nto a wonderful season for the\nHockey Club.\nWater Polo\nStaple/ Picked\nfor B.U.S. F. By S.H. Rowe\nThe term ended with a strong\nflavour of success for I.C. WaterPolo team. I.C. was selected to\nform the nucleus of a London\nUniversity \" B\" team at the\nBritish Universities Championships at Crystal Palace. The \" B\" team succeeded in crushing the\nhighly rated combined C.A.T.'s of Great Britain and also scored\ntwo victories against the combined\nIrish Universities and the Welsh\nUniversities. It was unfortunate\nthat the London \" B\" team did\nnot rank officially in the competition as they were clearly the only\nsuitable opposition, apart fro nU.A. U., to the London \" A\" team\nwhich won the competition. The\nhighlight of the B.U.S. F. meeting\nfor I.C. was the selection of\nStapley to represent the British\nUniversities against the German\nUniversities. We wish him luck\nfor the England under 21 trial\nlater this year.\nI.C.'s next battle ground is\ndown in the West Country where\nthey have tour matches against\nFowey, R.N. Manadon, R.N. Dartmouth, Torquay and Ilfracombe.\n\n"

Anyone who has heard the Peter Sellers skit\non American Travelogues will undoubtedly recognise from where\nthe original idea came, but the I.C. version is every bit as good\u2014in\nfact, it almost out-Sellers Sellers!\nOn the first side we have the four college chants, with the \" Hey\nVivo, perhaps the most vigorous.

This work deserves to reach a far\nwider audience than a carnival\nrecord could ever achieve, and\nis almost worth 7/6d. on its own.\nThe content is not all that ex-cells. In terms of technical quality,\nmuch credit must go to Terry\nMorrow, who has made a superb\njob of producing this impressive\ndown, it is the \" Minesman's Drill.\" The musical backing is\nexcellent, but the singing is not a pleasure to listen to. The words,\ntaken in the context of the remainder of the record, are undoubtedly\nof questionable taste, which might\ntend to lower the whole tone of\nthe record.\nI thought the first side was\ngood, and. if it was, then the\nsecond side is \" n\" times better.\nIt is hard to imagine the (in-famous \" Why was he born,\"\nbeing sung so well, and the ac- record.

Folk Song Club long-playing record\u2014released\nthis week\u2014is interesting in the professional appearance of the cover,\nbut disappointing in the overall lack of clarity in speech on the record.\nI think it only fair to compare this disc with the one I was concerned with 12 months ago. It was good to hear backings that were\nfuller and stronger, but unfortunate that they tended generally to\ndrown the voices.\nGREAT ECHO MOUNTAIN BOYS\nTheir most exciting piece is of their own composition\u2014Greenwood\nRag. This instrumental fairly bursts with life and provides a terrific\nopportunity to appreciate the virtues of solo folk instruments. Regrettably, their diction tended to be poor, especially Salty Dog Blues.\nI was glad to see Derek Hall's Sadie at last recorded for posterity,\nbut it is a pity that it is marred by the poor timing of his singing.\nGeordie is not the type of song that I normally associate with him,\nbut I was pleasantly surprised by the way he tackled it.\nIvor Grayson-Smith is an up-and-coming lad and bids fair to\nbeing next year's Folk Club President. But I hope that McColl's industrial ballads will not set the\npattern for next year's club repertoire. His diction remains poor\non The Butcher's Boy, though his\nguitar work is delightfully nimble,\nbut the fluctuations of volume and\ntone spoil this track.\nThe Wayfarers disappointed\nme. In spite of the fabulous sound\nChrist Wright has created on\nauto harp in Barbara Allen, singer\nAnu Hay gave a rather uninspired\nperformance. But this track at\nleast makes a clean sound, in\nstrict contrast with the un united mush of their follow-up number\n\u2014reminiscent of a wax recording\nof the 1920's plus bar-ball a dry finale.\nFor the record, a limited edition\nof 99 copies have been pressed\nand are on sale for just \u00a31 each.\nFor this money the quality of the\nrecord is all that can be expected.\nForeign Affairs\nSelected by Chris Lampard\nCARNIVAL REVUE CHANTALONG\nAn event definitely not to be\nmissed in the Carnival calendar is\nthe Carnival Revue being presented by members of the I.C. Dramatic Society on Friday, 14th May.\nThis revue features sketches and\nmaterial by kind permission of\nsome of Britain's leading scriptwriters (Frank Muir and Dennis\nNorden, and Johnny Speight), together with several musical and\nnovelty items.\nThis revue, under the title of\nChantalong, is being produced by\nthe capable and talented Miss\nBrenda Chant, with musical direction by Mr. Peter Long.\nWhat more can I say?\nSurely a must for Carnival\nWeek.\nJ.

S.W.3 KEN 4494/5/6\nAs the last car arrived at the\nR.V. in Gloucester, the situation\nwas not quite as expected;\nf fagin s were only twelve and\ntheir fixture had been changed to\n\" Stow-on-the-Wold,\" 26 miles\naway.\nThe eventual kick-off was 4.30\np.m.(1 hour late) with 16 men a side on a sloping pitch In a farm.\nThe many spectators witnessed a weak start by f fagin s, and a half\ntime score of 15\u20140 against.\nHowever f fagin s' will to win came\ntoo late, the final result being\n23\u201412 against.\nAs f fagin s left the field to return\nto the \" Unicorn\" they noticed\na large barn. The entertainment\nwas good; at eleven,f fagin s found themselves sitting in the rather\ncomfortable lounge of the Unicorn\nInn, thinking that no digs had\nbeen arranged, but they would\nsleep in the changing-rooms. It\nwas up to one of the brighter and\nhardier members to suggest the\nbarn.\nLousy Night\nSleep was interrupted abruptly\nat seven the next morning, by\nthe milking of cows. Alas, the\nrecumbent figures were discovered\nwhen the farm worker, Meadows,\ncame for a bale of straw. Dressed\nin rags, casually chewing a piece\nof straw, he skewered a handy\nbale with a two-pronged fork.\nJohn Hall narrowly escaped injury as those two long prongs\nentered the bale adjacent to his\nsleeping position in a pile of loose\nstraw.\nAlthough Meadows had obviously noticed most off fagin s( he\nhad stared Tony Phillips in the\neyes) he had not batted an eyelid.\nIt was only when greeted \" Morning \" did he reply, \" Mornin,'\nrats bite, boy?\" as he slung the\nbale over his shoulder and walked\noff.\nMany Injuries\nThe next three days were\nequally action packed. However,\nit will suffice to say that by Monday, when f fagin s were due to\nplay Weston United before an\nappreciable crowd, five men had\nbeen injured either on or off the\nfield. Pete Dunn and Tony\nPhillips had beaten lips, sustained\nwhen they had been dragged from\ntheir car and \" roughed-up \" in\nCheltenham. It is interesting to\nnote that in this same incident,\nHall had been thrown to the\nground and was kicked several\ntimes in the ribs, but not hurt.\nRichardson had seen the disadvantage in numbers and run away.\nThe position at Weston was\ndesperate; f fagin s had lost three\nfixtures played, and were due to\nplay a higher team than Merthyr\nCross Country\nPopular win in\ncollege 3 miles\nHurlingham, March 24th1 st A.

This was a deserved\nand popular success as Bishop,\nthis year's captain, has worked\nhard to produce a reasonable college team out of the limited talent\navailable.\nR.C.S., who were without their\nthree fastest men, did well to get\nwithin two points of Guilds' winning total. All credit to Mines for\nfinishing a team.\nAlthough the College 1st team\nhas hit a lean spell, the club is\nstill flourishing as was shown by\nthe good attendance at the\nA.G.M. and those elected were\u2014\nPresident: Dave Penfold (Phys.)\nCaptain: Howard Dickson (Elec.\nEng.)\nV.

This matter was put right\nwhen the Captain of Ffagins was\nintroduced to the Chairman of the\nCommittee. It was explained that\nf fagin s were from London, to\nwhich the Chairman replied\n\" Where's that?\" anyway a Committee Meeting has to be held in\norder to reverse the fixtures, the\nresult of which was never dis-closed.\nRichards To\nThe rescue\nMeanwhile, Tony Richards had\narrived and though ill, had\nbrought a large friend. The\nother places were filled by members of Weston's rival club, Hornets. The game was exciting and\nenjoyable. For some reason the\ncrowd were unbelievably biased\ntowards f fagin s and with the ii tremendous encouragement, the\nvisitors won 11-3.

Vogler\nCARNIVAL\nCarnival, despite all the efforts of the Committee, once again\nseems to be failing through lack of popular support from the majority\nof I.C. Students. Unlike Universities, such as Bristol, and Manchester,\nwhere nearly all students partake in their Carnival week to some extent,\nI.C. relies on the faithful few. The same faces appear, time after time,\norganising and participating in the various I.C. functions. For the\nCarnival to make a real impact, it needs every student at I.C.( all\n3,100) to spend at least one afternoon or evening collecting money in\nthe West End, helping to build stalls for the Carnival fe te, floats for\nthe procession, etc.\nIn recent years, the procession and fe te have been the biggest flops\nof the week. These functions\u2014where the money can really come\nrolling in\u2014are almost totally ignored by the General Student. It must\nbe most disheartening for the Committee and their few helpers, to\nspend a very great deal of time arranging events, etc.; only failing to\nget sufficient support from the rest of I.C. to carry them out.\nIt is not too late to help with this year's fe te and procession. For\nall you who have done nothing this year, now is your chance to come\nout of your brown bag and prove that I.C. can collect more than\n\u00a35,000.\nIt is high time that a Union Meeting had a full discussion about\nour Carnival. It is surely ludicrous to expect students to spend much\ntime when exams are imminent. The Spring Term would seem the\nmost suitable; when people could better afford to contribute to the\nCarnival.\nEXAMS\nWell, the great day is rapidly approaching! For some (e.g.3 rd year Electricals) it has already passed. Examinations are with us again,\nso student \" life \" is slowing down; parties are becoming harder and\nharder to find. New faces emerge in lectures and notes exchange hands\nwith increasing rapidity, as those of us who somehow managed to miss\na lecture or two endeavour to make up for too much sleep. Coffee\nparties night after night are non-existent; the bar is deserted until\n10.45 p.m. when the better late than nevers \" come in for a quick\n% pint and then disappear back to their rooms.\nConversation has changed.

The Hockey Club were told that\nthey had to supply the names of all players of a visiting Dutch team (who were to stay in hall)\nsome time prior to the visit\u2014a somewhat impossible task. Unabashed, the club promptly replied\nwith the names of a visiting Dutch international\nteam and have heard nothing since. Touche\\\nPostgraduate students who wish to stay in Hall\nduring the Summer Vacation have, reasonably, to\nfill in forms requesting a place. What seems quite\nunnec es ary is that these forms have to be accompanied by passport photographs\u2014especially as no\nform of selection committee is involved, and the\noffice already has photos of all residents.\nHowever, these unhappy examples of petty\nofficialdom pall into insignificance when one considers the fantastic machinery for \" electing \" the\nI.C. Carnival Queen. The R.C.S. Union takes\nabout twenty minutes to elect a Queen of Jez for a year. I.C. needs ten official selectors, two formal\nballs, and four complimentary May Ball tickets,\nto select a Carnival Queen whose sole official function appears to be an under publicized and overdressed appearance at the head of the Carnival\nprocession. It is not as if this procedure gives\nthe procession a much needed publicity boost\u2014\npatrons of formal dos are a minority group, and\nto date no one has even bothered to inform Felix\nwho the semi-finalists are. If the selection has to\nbe carried out in semi-secret, let the organisers do\nit at a normal committee meeting. Better still,\nhowever, use the R.C.S. system, and let the lucky\nlady play a more prominent role in the week's activities.\nADVERTISING ABUSES\nI am wondering how much was paid by that\nclub round the corner for the recent advertisers'\nannouncements purporting to be news items which\nhave appeared in this paper and Sennet. If, as I suspect, the answer is nothing, then they ought to\nbe charged quick. I.C. Groups play there on a professional basis, and it is ludicrous for the Union\nto pay for any of their advertising. There has been\nconsiderable discussions recently about whether\nCollege groups and bands should pay themselves\nfor appearing at College functions which they\norganize, as the Jazz Club does already. Sympathy\nwith their case will not be increased by abuses like\nthis.\nA MATTER OF OPINION\nAnother hostelry in the area recently achieved\ndubious fame by mention in a colour supplement\nas a place where the girls were beautiful and the\nprices rock bottom.

The hustings were held\non May 6th, at the Union Meetings. All the candidates for the\nvarious positions accounted themselves well.\nHowever, it is the duty of every\nGuildsman and Guildswoman to\nregister their vote at the election\non Thursday, May 20th. Surely,\nan hour, even at this hectic time\nof the year, is a small price to pay\nfor a good Union next year. You\nhave a vote. Use it, use it well,\nand use it wisely.\nCountdown\nMonday, May 2nd was the date\nof the Guilds\" take over bid \" for\nthe Countdown Club in Gloucester Road. Only some thirty\ncouples assisted in the coup, but\nall agreed that it was an excellent\nevening. It was a pity that more\ndid not come, for this was an\nideal opportunity to impress the\nnew bird at the start of the term.\nFilm\nAt long last we have all had\nthe opportunity to see the long\nawaited, and much talked about\nGuilds Film \" Only a Game in a Guilded Box.\" The Union should\nbe grateful to Nick Coope for the\nexcellent photography (especially\nthe dream sequences), and to\nDave Bishop for editing the result\nand adding the sound track. The\nresulting film is something of\nwhich the Union can be proud.\nR.C.S. DINNER\nThe first \" Annual R.C.S. Dinner \" was held on the first Friday\nof term. The choice of Guest Speakers in Professor Levy, who has\nretired, and Professor Hills, from Southampton\u2014both ex-staff of\nR.C.S. \u2014was commendable.\nProfessor Levy, after a history of toasts, asked what a Union was.\nHe said it was a complete abstract\u2014a point which was disputed by a noisy gentleman on the middle table, who had frequent comment to\nmake. Professor Levy got as far as say ing the buildings were concrete\n(the dinner was held in South Side) and closed his remarks. Apparently\nhe intended to say more but cut short his Speech \" as he could see the\nmeeting was getting boorish.\"\nThe comments were often amusing, but should have been curtailed\nduring the guests' speeches. For some the comments livened the\ndinner up, though others would have preferred a more formal evening,\nobviously there's a balance, we can enjoy ourselves without insulting\nour guests. In my opinion a boisterous evening was to be expected\nand the guests should have been warned. Professor Hills seemed to\nexpect it and enjoyed it, and his speech was pure amusement.\nIt all depends on where your bias lies; this is a vague concept depending on the square of the number of sherries knocked back\nbeforehand. I personally was not e mbar assed by the audience reaction,\nthough it was suggested the top table were.\nI was more e mbar assed, some might say guilt-stricken, by the\nsermon we had on our attitude to the money we're given (I think that\nwas it, I was sinking fast by this time). 1 didn't think this was the time\nor place\u2014having just spent a pound we were entitled to enjoy our-selves.

Dinner\nThe year is winding to a close\nand it is time that I gave an\naccount of the achievements and\nsins of our Union. I am happy\nto record that there are no sins\nbut many achievements. Minesmen have good reason to hold\ntheir heads on high this year.\nWe started it comparatively\nquietly by coming second in the\nboat races, and swimming and\nwater polo events; but this was\nonly the beginning. From this\npoint onwards Mines swept aside\nall opposition and carried off all\nbut one of the available trophies.\nThe onslaught started with the\nHockey Club winning the Stephenson Cup for the first time in 10\nyears and were rapidly followed\nby the Rifle Club who won the\nCourt Shield for the first time in\n28 years. The Soccer Club then\nastounded everyone by winning\nthe I.C. Six-a side Competition\nwithout conceding a goal. Pride\nof place, however, must go to the\nRugby Club who have brought\nback four trophies to R.S. M. They started with strong and convincing wins over R.C.S. and\nGuilds to win the Sparkes and\nEngineers Cups.\nIn a more leisurely fashion, the\nRugby Club entertained the Paris\nSchool of Mines for a 'weekend,\nbeating them at rugby and then\ntaking them to the France-England International Match. But\nthe highlight of the season was\nthe hard and tense game against\nCamborne School of Mines when\nR.S. M. triumphed by 9-6 to keep\nthe \" Bottle,\" where it belongs in\nLondon for the third year in sue\ncession.\nIn the non-sporting fields,\nMines have also shone, tying in\nthe Debating competition with\nGuilds. The Motor Club have\nbeen active keeping Clementine\never present this year and taking\nher twice to Brighton, on Rallies.\nThe Mines-Guilds Carnival was\na success and the Mines Ball went\nto even greater strength.\nIn December we entertained 11\nstudents from foreign mining\nschools at the R.S. M. for 5 days,\nclimaxing their visit with a splendid array of Icwarian girls at the\nMines Ball. The visit was enormously successful and we trust\nthat it will go from strength to\nstrength in coming years.\nThis has been a great year for\nthe Royal School of Mines union.\nSpirit, has been as high as if not\nhigher, than in previous years and\nMinesmen have achieved their victories as much on spirit and enthusiasm as on native ability.\nI believe that the spirit will\nstrengthen and Mines will continue to lead Imperial College.\nWe have a unique and special\nposition in being so small a college and so successful.

None came f. for the neighbours somehow forgot to phone them up. Nevertheless, the\nCommandoes did the best they could to remedy this and phoned the Police themselves, who.were simply not interested.

Liberal Society:\nBritain should grasp the initiative\nfor peace talks, he urged, and\nbring the brutal war to an end.\nReconvention of the 1964 Geneva\nconference with North Vietnam\nand China being represented was\nsuggested and it was emphasised\nthat any solution must involve the\nwhole of Indo-China.\n46-LINE MOTION\nThe agricultural policy of an\nOxford delegate provided I.C.L. S. with their third motion! Since\nthat particular delegate was unable to attend Dave Pearson\nstepped into the breach at short\nnotice. The comprehensive 46\nline motion called for the instigation of co-operatives in the buying\nand distributive sides of agri cul ture.\nEdward Fortune was elected\nrepresentative for the London\nArea Group on the U.L.

Special responsibilities were\nconferred on him by this body to\nrepresent the Union of the World\nFederation of Liberal and Radical\nYputh, also the New Orbits group\nof the Liberal Party.\nMIKE MANSFIELD\nAnglicans\nOn The Move\nAfter two terms in which the\nemphasis has been on expansion\nand growth of our community,\nthe Anglican Chaplaincy is, during this summer term, concentrating on achieving a deepening of\nthe community.\nThe main instrument of our\nwork in this direction will be a series of evening meetings, when\nsmall groups will meet for meals\nin Southside and spend the rest\nof the evening in informal dis-course, ending with a celebration\nof the Holy Communion.\nWe hope that from our improved fellowship may spring a more interested group of people,\nwho, together with other Christians in the College, may bring\nmore and more people to discover\nthe joy of Christ.\nA.

With a large and growing stake\nin asbestos-cement, in insulation, in brake linings and in\nplastics T&N is closely linked to all four major areas of\neconomic growth. To the building industry; the motor\nindustry; the newer plastics; and to activity in the developing\nterritories of the Commonwealth ... all adding up to a strong-ly-expanding \u00a3100,000,000 business with 39,000 employees.\nOverseas, with 17 companies in 10 countries, T&N has\ndoubled its interests in ten years.\nA Career with T&NT& N offers outstanding graduates in science, engineering or the arts, a career of great scope, keyed from the first to areas in which expansion is\nat its fastest . . . opportunity at its best. Moreover, under our broad and\nflexible training scheme, the graduate assumes managerial responsibility\nmore confidently, and certainly earlier, than is often the case in industry\ntoday. T&N also recruits scientists and engineers direct into its research\nand development branches, whose projects are particularly closely linked\nto the needs of the expanding industries. Opportunities for supervising\nwork with a practical application, as well as for fundamental study, are thus\noutstandingly good.\nIf you are interested, ask your Appointments Board for further details, or\nwrite direct to: Management Appointments Adviser, Turner & Newall Ltd.,\n15 Curzon Street, London, W1 (Telephone GROsvenor 8163)\nTURNER A NEWALL LIMITED asbestos, plastics and insulation\n\u2022 IH Turners Asbestos Cement Co.

    "content": "8 FELIX\nSHEDDING THE LOAD\nCarnival week is here, but how many people realise the hard\nwork that is done to make it possible ? Planning started way back\nin November and the events since then have been numerous. Events\nof this nature can only occur when tko y involve a large number of\nstudents. This year, instead of one Chairman there has been a committee with specific responsibilities and this \" shedding the load \"\nnot only involves more people but makes progress and the carrying\nout of new ideas possible.\nOne man's free time is limited, 20 men's free time is limited but\nthe effort of 3000 students could topple the government. The spreading\nof responsibility within Imperial College Union has been practised\nthis year and it is hoped that this will continue. At one time the\nUnion Executive performed more or less every duty except for those\nconnected with the Clubs, constituent colleges, or Entertainments, but\nrecently new posts have been created. Last year a Halls representative\nwas elected to look after the interests of those people who were or\nhoped to be in residence. This year for the first time we have had a Deputy President and the size of his job has definitely justified his\nexistence.\nPostgraduate problems have\ncome to the fore and there may\nbe a need for some form of centralised representation.\nThe travel plans of students\nare becoming more ambitious\u2014\nmaybe the Union should help in\nthis field.\nThese are all jobs which could\nand should be performed by your\nrepresentatives with help from\nmany other students. The obvious people to fill these posts\nmust surely be the ordinary members of Council selected from the\nI.C. Union Annual General Meeting. See to it that your representatives are willing and able to\nperform these services for you.\nNORMAN E. PRICE\nThis year we have appointed\none man to be responsible for external affairs and as a result have\nsuccessfully entertained Russian\nand German students, and arranged an exchange scheme with\nthe latter country involving study,\nvisits and vacation work.\nA Union yearbook is being introduced for next year\u2014another\nstudent contribution.\nA lecturing methods conference\nis being organised in a week's time not by the Executive but by\ninterested people inside and outside the Council. The post of\nU.L. U. Agent (i.e. the man responsible for lias on between I.C. and the University Union) has become important in recent years.\nPhornphan Stholusta, a first-year Botanist from Thailand, crowned\nthis year's Carnival Queen at the May Ball last Friday night.

So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank THE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"

Eysenck\nThe Biological Basis of Personality\nor Stop Worrying\u2014\nIn an expertly delivered lecture, Prof. Eysenck explained to what\nextent personalities are a result of the biological structure of human\nbeings. The illuminated audience relieved to find they were not mere\nconditioned automatons replied with resounding applause and\nnumerous questions.\nThe ancient classification of personality as Sanguine, Phlegmatic,\nMelancholic; Choleric; remains basically the same in modern thought,\nthough now it is considered that a personality may display these\nIT'S ALL DAD'S FAULT\nvarious traits in varying degrees,\nbelong to one of the four types.\nCharacter may be classified as a point on a chart, where the a bsc is sae vary from extreme introversion\nto extreme extroversion and the\nordinates from extreme stability\nto extreme instability. The normal\nperson is at the zero and the numerical incidence in an average\nsample follows a normal gaussian\ndistribution about the zero along\neach of the axes.\nIDENTICAL TWINS\nUsing such a classification,\nShields, in an experiment with\nidentical and fraternal human\ntwins, established that the identical twins (born of one ovary), even\nwhen brought up separately,\nshowed more similarity of personality than fraternal twins, from\nsimultaneous fertilisation of two\nova brought up together. Though\naccurate estimations of the quantities involved in such studies are\ndifficult, the cumulative positive\nevidence is beyond doubt. Hence\nthe he rid it ary character normally\ndominates environmental cond i where previously one could only\nboning.\nNORMAL PUNISHMENT\nMEANINGLESS\nThe subjects reaction to conditioning is however dependent\non his personality, and it is found\nthat in some cases (e.g. of p sch y ha vi our is controlled i.e. introvert\nreserved. Alcohol for instance\ndeadens cortical activity and produces extrovert behaviour.\nCortical excitation is controlled\nby the output of a structure deep\nin the brain known as the Reticular Formation. The output of this\njn ember to the cortex normally\ncontrols the level of excitation or\ninhibition in the cortex and hence\nindirectly overt behaviour. (Pav-lov has shown that inhibition is\nnot merely absence of excitation).\nUnfortunately, because of its\nsituation deep in the brain little is\nyet known about the structure of\nNeurotic\n(ICWA)\nMelancholic\nIntrovert \u00ab<fc Unstable Phlegmatic\nCriminal\n(22, Links)\nCholeric\n>- Extrovert\nStable\nSanguine\nthe Reticular Formation.\nSOME QUESTIONS\nHow far can. results of experiments with animals be used to\npredict Human behaviour!\nExperiments in conditioning can\nbe usefully extrapolated, but so\ncalled neurotic behaviour induced\nin animals is not a satisfactory\nparallel to human condition.\nAre women more neurotic than\nmen?\nWomen tend to be more intro-vert, and he nc* to be neurotic\nrather than criminal. They also!\nhave more time to go to a psychiatrist or a clinic. Such considerations have to be taken into account when making such a social\nobservation.\nIs there evidence to show that\nthe more extrovert criminals are\ncaught because they brag about\ntheir exploits.\nWe do not have a controlled\nsample of those who do not get\ncaught.\nD.S.

The normal modes of punishment are to such people completely meaningless. From studies\nof the activity of the brain in relation to behaviour, it is seen that\nthe cortex exerts controlling influence on the autonomic nervous\nsystem, and hence behaviour. If\ncortical activity is high, overt be-Scientists and engineers: research workers in new fields of human\nknowledge: and practical men to direct huge engineering enter-p rises; the Civil Service needs them fell. More, it can provide them\nall with work ex acd y suited to individual qualifications and talents.\nThe Government is today the largest employer of scientists and\nengineers in the country, and has staff working in almost every\nfield of pure and applied science and engineering. Plant pathology\nand naval architecture, thermodynamics and physiology, celestial\nmechanics and highway engineering: these are just a few diverse\nexamples.\nProspects in the Civil Service compare favourably with those\nexisting in industry: every able scientist or engineer should achieve\na salary of \u00a32,500 within a reasonable period; and an outstanding\nman or woman (they receive equal pay) will do so in the early thirties.\nThe top posts, which carry salaries of up to \u00a38,000, are open to all.\nAt each level, there is full scope for the exercise of personal initiative\nand responsibility. Laboratory equipment and engineering facilities\nare of the highest order. Conditions of service are good and pensions\nare non-contributory.
