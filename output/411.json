    "content": "1\n0 FELIX\nHockey\nIC on form\nKingston Grammar School 4\nImperial College 1st XI 2\nKGS HAVE A reputation for\nhockey. Make no mistake,\nhalf a dozen international\nschoolboy caps a year\nspeaks for itself. So it\nwas with some trepidation\nthat IC left the changing\nrooms. The pre-match chat\nby Big Jim included details\nof our new tactics; man for\nman marking in the 25,\n4:3:3, with the centre\nback acting as a sweeper.\nAfter 15 minutes of play\nno-one had settled to the\nnew system and we were\ntwo goals down, one a rising\nrocket of a shot that leaves\nCharlie wishing he had his face mask on (at least!),\nthe other a penalty. Our\nplay improved as Alan Brown\nand Alistair Ross took\ncontrol of the midfield,\nwinning plenty of ball and\ndistributing it well. IC\nbegan to play well and a break and cross from the\nright met Bob Middleton, who\nbeat the goalie at the near\npost.\nOur improved play\ncontinued in the second\nhalf, indeed we hit a 'purple patch' during which\na cross from the left allowed\n'Superstar' to score a superb goal to make it\n2 - 2 .\nHowever, fate and the\nUmpires were not with us. Many good chances were\nsquandered and IC succumbed\nto defensive tactics for the\nlast quarter. The defense\nplayed well, but a controversial penalty and a penalty corner se:t led the issue. Team: C Brown, K Houlden,\nJ Marshall (capt), J Cooke,\nA Ross, A Brown, H Magnay,\nT Tutu, R Fatania, B Middleton, J Latter.\nIC saves a point\nImperial College XI 2\nSmiths 2\nIC GOT OFF to an\nexcellent start against the\nLeague Leaders scoring two\ngoals in the first five minutes.\nBob Middleton converted a Trev Tutu cross and then\nA lister Ross slotted the ball\nin from the edge of the 'D1\n.'\nThe play in the rest of the\nfirst half was even, with\nboth sides coming close to scoring. However just as\nIC had struck quickly in the\nfirst half, so Smiths equalise d with two swift goals just\nafter the interval. Smiths\nthen began to apply intense\npressure to the IC defence\nbut were unable to put the\nball in the net. IC looked\nin trouble when the Smiths\numpire awarded his own\nside a penalty after missing\na blatant obstruction by\none of their players. However\njustice was done, when\nCharlie Brown palmed the\nball away and saved IC a point. Smiths, pressing for\npromotion, were perhaps the\nmore skillful side, but this\nwas balanced by the running\nand work rate of IC's two\ninside forwards Mike Isles\nand A lister Ross.A Special\nMention must be made of\nJohn Andrews whose excellent\numpiring was appreciated\nby all concerned.\nTeam:- C Brown, J Marshall\n(capt), K Houlden, N Woodgate,\nN Woodhouse, H Magnay,\nT Tutu, A Ross, R Middleton,\nM Isles, S Golding.\nJ Latter\nCross Country\nSo near...\nTHE POT HUNTING season\nbegan in earnest on Wednesday\n4th Feb. Last year at the\nSt Edmund Hall relay at\nOxford IC managed the\nsilver medal position, so\nthis year they were looking\nfor gold. The relay consists of four laps of the 3 mile\ncourse around the gravel\npaths of the University\nparks. Steve Webb ran the\n1st leg for the ' A' team\nand \" was extremely worried\nfor the first mile or so\nbecause Alf Garnett running\nthe 1st leg for the ' B' team\nwas well in front. However\nat the end of the lap the\nteams were in correct order\nbut separated by only 20\nseconds. David Rosen held\n8th position for the ' A' team,\nclosely pursued by Paul\nClarke for the ' B' team\nretaining 12th position.\nStill separated by only 25\nseconds Rob All in son and\nAlan Leakey took over for\nthe ' A' and ' B' teams\nrespectively. Rob anxious to\navenge defeats by Alan at orienteering and spurred\non as the leading teams\nbegan to fade, pulled the\n' A' team up from 8th to 2nd position with a time of 14.00\n(pity it wasn't13.95eh?). That could be the fastest\nlap of the day; (official\nconformation is still needed.\nAlan consolidated the ' B' THE MATCH last Saturday\nessentially started at Euston\non Friday lunchtime. The IC\n1st team ( minus Rob\n(unavailable All in son) plus\na few o.thers headed north\ndisguised as a University\nof London A team for the\nBritish Student Championships\nat Stirling. Eight hours, a few\nbars and a chip shop later\nsaw them at Stirling University. The race, 3 laps of a ZVi mile course that was in esse rise just a lap of the\ncampus was won by Ray\nSmedley of Birmingham\nUniversity in 36.17, who as a result, won half a ton of\nmedals, cups, beer, whisky\nplus a medal for the person\nRowing\nRollocks , races and a party\nDODGE MS.A poor mans river\ncruise. Games on the Thames.\nSlaughter on the water. Air your liver on the river. These\nare all possible descriptions\nof the activities of the\nBoat Club which is now in\nfull training for the' Head\nof River races this term and\nthe regatta season in the\nsummer.\nThe first race of the term\ntakes place at Reading\ntomorrow. It is the Harp\nLarger competition which\nthe first eight won last\nyear; they hope to repeat\nthat performance. All eights\nare competing including the\nwomen, so it should turn\nout to be a Memorable\nOccasion. It is also rumoured that\nTirian (the UL second\neight) failed to form a pair\nand so Joe Shrinkneck has\nbeen coaxed back after a years absence. The circumstances of Paul Languths'\nreturn are probably best\nleft unrecorded.\nThe second eight continue\nto cause alarm with a tendency\nto, well,( how best to put\nthis?) - take advantage of\ntactical leads when rowing\nagainst the firsts. What is\ncertain is that the position\nof 'fastest crew' will not\nautomatically be left to the\nfirst eight.\ncontinued on page 9\nteam run by holding 12th position. Ian Ellis( capt)\nset off on the last leg not\nfar behind first position\nbut was told by Rob in no\nuncertain terms not to\nattempt to catch him, as\nthe lad now in 1st position\nwas another well known\nfarmer from S LH. The teams\nwaited with baited breath\nfor Ian to return, and were\ndisappointed to find he was in 3rd position as he entered\nthe last half mile. He was, however, on the shoulder of\nthe man in 2nd place, who\nwas now looking rather\nworried. At the appointed\nplace 200m from home Ian\nopened up and smoothed his way into 2nd place to the\ncheers of the IC teams.\nDave Jones had his glory\ntoo, lifting the ' B' team from\n12th to a final position\nof 11th. Meanwhile the ' C team\nwere fighting a rear guard action. Mike Welford had\nled them off well and Pete\nJohnson returning to fitness\nraised their position to put\nthem 24th and well off the\nbottom. Nigel Miller\nlost this place by unfortunately\ntaking the wrong turning,\nbut Andy Davey feeling\nstrong after a restful week\nheld 25th position finishing\nthe ' C team with still 3 or\n4 teams behind them!\nyet so far\nwho had won the most\nmedals. University of London\nA's were not so successful but narrowly missed the\nwooden spoon, when a member\nof LSE out sprinted someone\nfor last place. The first 3 UL men home\nwere IC runners, Steve Webb 112th, Ian Ellis149 th, David Rosen 160th, then\nfinished by Paul Clarke. The weary team returned\nhome on the Sunday by\nBritish Snail, who were\nhaving trouble deciding\nwhen to shut the bar. The\nweekend was characterised\nby a key word but there are\nessentially no prizes for\nguessing what it was.

Alan Leakey\nhad a reasonable run to\nfinish in 94min. for the\n10.8km' A' course. Rob\nAll in son made a few detours\nin his 108min. run and Pete\nJohnson did well for his\n119min.

The team\nneeded some confidence-building after recent\ndisappointments and that\nwas provided in full measure\nby Martin Cotter. All through\nthe match confidence grew,\nreaching a peak in the last\ntwenty minutes when four\ntries were scored.\nThe first half was fought\nclosely. Barclays Bank\nscored first. A penalty near\nthe A's line gave them an\neasy try, which they converted.\nHowever, the A's had the\nmeasure of the Bank almost\nfrom the outset; it was only\na matter of time before that\nwas reflected in the score.\nThe first of Martin Colt er's three penalties was quickly\nfollowed by a well handled\nmove on the right wing which\nput Dave Bramley over for\none of his two tries. Two\npenalties, one for each\nside, gave the A's a slim\n1 0 - 9 lead at half time.\nT|?e second half showed\nhow well the A's can play.\nThe backs moved the ball\naround confidently, and the\nforwards won the ball, especially in the scrum s, with\nconsummate ease. Dave\nBramely then got his second\ntry. But, the man who broke\nthe Bank was Martin Cotter.\nAfter his third penalty the\nA's knew that it was their\ngame. In the last twenty\nminutes it was a question\nonly of the number of points\nthe A's would be ahead at the\nend. Play never left the\nBank's half, with the A's dominating completely. Chris Becque led the spree.\nExploiting a gap in the\nBank's cover he nipped\nthrough to score. Martin\n9\nCotter converted. Two tries\nfollowed. Amiss kick by\nthe Bank's full back enabled\nthe A's to exploit a massive\ngap in the' defence and\nChris Cuthbertson to score\neasily. The final blow was\nstruck by Jon Pitcher who\nmade a good run on the\nleft to collect a well-timed\npass from Hugh Duncan and\nscore in the corner.\nIn the end the score was\n33.9. Such was the quality\nof the teamwork that a score\neven more favourable to the\nA's would have been an\neven more accurate indicator.\nIt was a real team effort.\nTeam:- Ft Pullen, D Bramley,\nC Becque, R Leeson, J Pitcher; M Cotter, H Duncan,\nW Bubb, A Fitzgerald, J Day,\nC Cuthbertson, S Downing,\nJ Fisherburn, K Hawkins,\nN Wiltshire.\nby Chi is Cuthbertson\nPRIZE CROSSWORD No. 30 ACROSS led\nhits\nrest\nwith\nto\none\nThe \u00a31 winner will be\ndrawn from the Editor's Hat at noon next Wednesday\n18th February.

Who said that? Freud? Goebbels?\nJung?. No, none of these, but George\nRobey, probably better known for being\nthe cause of laughter than the analyst\nof its causes. I am indebted to the programme of\nComedians for drawing my attention\nto that quotation, for it really underlines\nwhat Trevor Griffiths is about in this\nplay. If you want to earn your living by\nmaking people laugh, it is not enough\njust to think up a few jokes and then\ntell them well. You' ve got to understand\nwhat it is that you can give your\naudience, that will elicit the right\nreactions.\nLast week's Listener contained an\narticle on John Cleese, by Wilfred\nDe'Ath, in which it is revealed that\nwhen they were writing Fawlty Towers,\nMr Cleese and his wife discussed\"... Basil Fawlty in terms of transactional\nanalysis: as to whether, at certain\ntimes, Basil was behaving as a parent\nor as a child\". It is pretty clear that\neven if you cannot spot the winners\nevery time, you can make a pretty\ninformed judgement as to which routines\nwi 1\n1 succeed.\nMr Griffiths sets his theories into a neat framework around the debuts of\nsix would-be stand-up comics. They\nhave already spent months perfecting\ntheir acts under the tutelage of an\nestablished comic, played by Jimmy\nJewel. The audience in the theatre is\ncleverly used as the membership of the.\nManchester working men's club where\nthe acts are tried out. It is hard to\ngauge how the northern audience would\ntake to the acts since their reactions\nmust be, in some ways, different from\nthose produced in the west end. The\ntalent scout has the hard job of handing\nout contracts to acts which may have got\na better reaction in Manchester than\nthey did in London.\nStephen Re a stands head and shoulders\nabove the rest, both in his own performance\nand in that of George Mc Brain, the\ndocker from Belfast. It was interesting\nto note that two of the best received\ngags came from outside the comic\nteam; the school caretaker with the\nresults of the karate class, and the\nilliterate Indian looking for the 'Reading\nto Learn' class as a solution to his\nproblem.\nThomas Stevenson\nComedians is a Nottingham\nPlayhouse production, and was seen\nin the National Theatre repertoire\nat the Old Vic. It has come to my\nnotice that the cheapest seats,\nbook able in advance, at the new\nNational Theatre will be \u00a32.35. At\nthe Old Vic it is possible to book\nseats for as little as 40p.I don't suppose many students will be able\nto queue on the day of the performance\nfor the \u00a31.00 and 50p seats. Any comments?\nOPSOC: A sparkling performance\nUTOPIA LIMITED or The Flowers of Progress\nby W.S. Gilbert and A.S. Sullivan.\nFIRST PERFORMED in 1893 (when it\nran for 245 performances), Utopia\nLimited has only been, performed very\nrarely since then and in this delightful\nproduction, staged by the IC Operatic\nSociety, we see some of the reasons\nfor this. The opera is fairly topical\nand poses technical difficulties in its\nproduction, requiring no fewer than\n18 soloists a rather large number for\nan opera.\nDespite this and many other difficulties, and the obvious drawback of a small\nstage OP SOC have succeeded where\nmany others might have failed. The opera is brought alive by a cleverly designed stage (Dramsoc\nrule ok!\nand some very imaginative\nand sinking costumes. The props\naside, however, deserved praise must\ngo to the cast for a well executed\nand sparkling performance.\nSpecial mention must go to\nDEBORAH KEMP( Lady Sophy) whose\nbeautiful singing was only matched by\nthe comical facial expressions of\nJOHN BARRATT( King Paramount I), both of whom were excellent in their\nroles. ROGER WOODWARD (Scaphio)\nand ROGER NICHOLS( Phantis), as\nthe two tyrannical wise men keeping a watchful eye over the K. ing, constantly\ndelighted the audience with their\n'routines'. STEVE CHAY TOW( Lord\nDramaleigh, a British Lord Chamberlain)\nand DELI TH BROOK( Princess Zara)\nadded i dio sync rac ies and charm respectively to the proceedings. Ms\nBrook and Mr Barratt sing very well\nin this first night performance considering\nthat both had only just recovered from\ntonsillitis. The opera is a biting satire of the\nEnglish way of life and its institutions.\nThis is highlighted on two occasions. First, when the two younger princesses\nmime on Lady Sophy's song on \" how an a ice young English lady should\nconduct herself\", that is, how to turn\none's nose up at an unsuitable suitor.\n\" Young ladies always toss\"( to\nsettle who gets the man), she concludes. The second is a burlesque of the\nDowning Street proceed ure as it is\npresented \" in accordance with the\npractice of St Jame's Hall\". The music is liberally strewn with\npopular(?) pieces such as \" Rule, Britt ania\" and \" the National Anthem\" which taken together with acting,\nresult in very funny scenes. The\noverture used here is one specially composed by Max Taylor - Sullivan' s original has not survived.\nThe orchestra, ably conducted by\nDAVID CREED, played well and\nfound time to laugh at the gags inbetween\nplaying. All in all, a very enjoyable\nproduction from OP SOC. Paul Ekpenyong\nNOTICE Mr Meacock gave 3 students a lift to Westborne Terrace on Wednesday 4th February and has since\nfound two pens in the back of\nhis car.\nWould the students concerned\nplease contact him, Room 307\nSherfield.\nPROF.

We understand thi a to mean aid t \u00a9 the people of these countries to develop their economies, not aid te subsidiaries \u00bbf British companies, or into the \"pockets\" of the\nexisting elites in these countries. These m \u00abral obligations of Britain must be seen in proper historical and economic\ncontext. British colonial rule or economic domination, for example, in Greece or Latin America, are in many cases the cause of the economic underdevelopment of these countries, which in turn is responsible for the lack of educational facilities. On the other hand,\nthe colonial exploitation of natural and human resources has contributed to the\ndevelopment of the British educational system.\nEven today, Britain continues to have neo colonial links with many developing\ncountries such as Malaysia and many African states. British companies operating in these countries extract, in the form of profits, much more than the \u00a350Ma year that it theoretically costs to educate overseas students in Britain. CONCLUSION\nThe discriminatory fees structure does not provide any significant financial revenue\nto the educational institutions. There is no just basis for any further increase in overseas students fees. Such discriminatory policies, as higher fees and immigration\nrestrictions, must be seen in their proper context.\nA campaign to abolish discriminatory fees and to oppose further fees increases must\nbe launched in all colleges and universities. British students must take an important\npart in this campaign-the fees increases are just part of the Educational Cuts policy and the decreasing living standards for all students.

    "content": "FIU X5 Everything you always wanted to know about the\nfees increase\nTHE FEES INCREASE The Government, en the recommendation of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals( CVCP), has proposed a30% increase in the fees for next year. This is an\nof \u00a330 for \"Home Students\" and \u00a3100 for Overseas Students, bringing the Overseas fee to \u00a34L6.00 per year. This will mean in ceased hardship and lower standards of living for all self supporting students, mainly those from abroad. The fees increase must be\nseen as part of the Government's attack on Higher Education, the Education Cuts policy. At the same time, the Home Office, in contradiction to the policy of the Ministry for Overseas Development, is imposing increasingly strict regulations for the renewal\nor extension of visas to overseas students, refusing, for example, visas to students\nwho were admitted to hospital, and therefore were not regularly attending their courses.\nWHY MUST WE OPPOSE THE FEES INCREASE? The main rationale behind the discriminatory fees structure and further fees .\nincreases is that they are needed to help bolster up the educational institutions which are in a financially difficult position because of the economic crisis. The lack\nof a basis for such an argument can be seen from the fact that here, at Imperial, the\ntotal proposed fees increase represent less than 1.2% of the total College expenditure.\nThe increase in overseas students' fees amounts to0.56% of this expenditure. That of\nself supporting students, British and Overseas, is about 0.4% of the total expenditure,\nan amount smaller than the net deficit of the refectories and bars during the previous\nyear.\nThus, any increase would have a negligible effect on the financial resources of the\nCollege. On the other hand, such increases would cause great hardship to overseas\nstudents. Even if the fees increases could help to support the educational institutions, we do not see why overseas students in particular, or for that matter, any other group\nof students, should pay to solve the economic crisis. The Government is spending many\nmillions of pounds on \"defense\", to keep military bases in Cyprus, troops in Oman and\nelsewhere. This money could more usefully be spent on education, without endangering\nthe security of the British people.\nThe presence of overseas students in Britain brings many material to it. First of\nall, overseas students bring at least \u00a31,200 each every year to cover tuition fees and\nliving expenses. There are altogether 96,000 overseas students who, together, bring \u00a3115 millions in foreign currency into Britain.\nA very large number of overseas students, especially in places like Imperial College,\nare doing research which is of great value to British industry,( and often of very\nlittle value to their own countries). There are 15,151 overseas students doing postgraduate studies in Britain, of which, 675 are at Imperial College.\nOverseas student nurses contribute a great deal to the National Health Service. There are 19,877 overseas student nurses working in British hospitals. Also, overseas\nstudents provide 4,502 language assistants in universities and schools.\nWe see that overseas students offer many direct and indirect benefits to Britain, in return for their education at \"non-economic\" fees. If we now look at some of the\nreasons which make overseas students come to Britain for their studies, we will see\nthat in most cases, Britain has a duty to educate these people.\nContinued on page 6\n\n"

I personally believe\nin 'representative democracy'.\" NUS, however, is based on 'active democracy'\n\u2014 where delegates are elected to\nconference \u2014 activists elect activists, who then elect the National Executive, who are, therefore, highly activist, and\nwho obviously do not represent the\nmajority of students.\n' A first step towards making NUS more representative,,\" he says,\" would be to adopt some of the Electoral Reform\nSociety' s suggestions, made in their\nnow famous letter to Charles Clarke. Initially this would mean electing\ndelegates to NUS Conferences by\nsecret college-wide ballot, and election\nof the VP s of NUS by STV. This would at least ensure that the VP s were representative of the cross section of people at conference. This is not he says, the case at present.\nThe next step would be to elect the\nfour sabbatical officers of NUS by\nnational ballot.\n\"Whether it will actually happen or\nnot is a different matter. The particular\npolitical group in power at the moment,\nthe Broad Left, obviously doesn't want to lose that power, so they are\ngoing to resist the change. Personally, I think its time they were put out of\npower \u2014 they have been there, more\nor less, since1968, and in those\nseven years, their achievements and\ntrade record have not exactly been\nthe greatest you could have hoped for.\nI think that they nave now become\nbankrupt of ideologies, of new campaigns,\nof new issues, and, more than anything\nel^ p, bankrupt o' new tactics for\ns.uo ents to use to get what they\nwant.''\n\" They( the Broad Left) spend too\nmuch time trying. to work out how\nthey are going to stay in power,\nrather than working out where\nstudents should be going...\" He fells that the Broad Left has\nbecome too much a political machine;\n\"they spend too much time trying to\nwork out how they are going to stay in\npower, rather than working out where\nstudents should be going. The big\nargument in their favour is that they\nve very, very dedicated people, and\nwork very hard.\"\nWithin IC, he feels that there is\nnot enough awareness amongst IC\nstudents of what ICU does for them.\nDespite the large number of people\ninvolved in the Union, the UG Ms are\nstill poorly attended, although these\nare not the whole of ^e Union. As far as Union meetings go, Pete would\nlike to think that the low turn outs\nreflect a satisfaction with the way the\nUnion is being run.\nHowever, as a academic exercise, he has often considered measures to\ntest this \u2014 such as putting the Union\n'on strike', and suspending all Union\naccounts. \"I know one of the first\nthings that would happen \u2014 the first\nWednesday afternoon, I would have\nabout 200 sportsmen knocking on my\ndoor saying \"where the bloody hell is\nour coach?\" Yet so many people don't realise these are provided by the\nUnion.\" If, on the other hand, there was\nno uproar, then he would conclude\nthat people did not care about thr\nUnion, and that College is was tina \u00a380,000 on it.\nHis final comments were, \"It's your Union; it is the Students' Union.\nJust try and realise what it does for\nyou, and, more than anything else,\ntake part in it \u2014 whether in a club,\nor society, or at the UGM or whatever,\njust try and take part.

It\nis interesting to note that\nthese people go to considerable\ntrouble to avoid a 'Mooney',\nand it is un li k \u00ably that they\nwould use the refectories\neven if they had to pay\nthe \" kitchen fee\". Surely, it is unfair to\nexpect these people to\nsubsidize those who would\nstill use the refectories.\nOne can only assume that\nthis will take us along a path, given a further\ndeterioration in quality and\nhence numbers of people\neating in the refectories,\nthat would lead to fully-staffed, but empty refectories.\nThose who would answer\nus with the suggestion, that\nby charging this fee, students\nin Southside would be\nthese are respectively on\nSport, that is, the inadequacy\nof present facilities and the\ninequalities between different sectors of Education;\nand on disabled students. I hope that IC Union will\nprior it is e both these subjects\nfor discussion at the next\nNUS conference.\nTeacher Education\nAs many of you will know,\nthe Department of Education\nand Science intends to\nreduce teacher training places\nin order to lower the proposed\n1981 target from 510,000\nto 480,000. At least 22\ncolleges are combining to\nform nine or ten composite\ninstitutions: another 17\nare merging with colleges of\nfurther education, and many\nplaces will disappear in the\nprocess of these mergers.\nAlso, at least 13 colleges will close and about four\ncolleges will be absorbed by\nUniversities, for example,\nat Loughborough.\nIn the West London area,\nseveral mergers are to take\nplace this year; Borough\nobliged to use the refectories\nin order not to waste the\nfee, would find that they\nhad not increased the number\nof meals served, but instead,\ncreated a great deal of\nill will. Though one sym pathis es with the problems faced by\nthe catering staff in the\npresent situation, nobody\ngains by maintaining\nartificially, a level of\nservice that is not required\nalthough we realise that\nthe design of the refectories\nis such that economies not\ninvolving redundancies are\ndifficult if not impossible.\nHowever, the last of\nMr Teague's suggestions\nmay turn out the most\nrealistic alternative. It is\npossible that by closing the\nrefectories over the weekend\nand in the evenings, and\noperating a smaller service\nin Southside. or if that is\nnot possible, in the Union,\nthen the fixed costs may be\nreduced hence making the\nfee unnecessary.\nIt is unfortunate that what\nappears to be the most\nreasonable suggestion was\ngiven so little explanation\nin \" Peter Patter\", perhaps\nit has already been ruled\nout!\nIt seems that once again,\nthe authorities are trying to\ntake the easy wav out. and\nare going to make the students\npay more money that they\ncan ill afford, rather than\nmakin q the system more\nefficient.\nRoad College are to merge\nwith Maria Grey, and Thomas\nHuxley College will join\nEaling Technical College.

This was in September \u2022 1972 when Pete\narrived, a green Brummy fresher -since then, he has not looked back.\nHowever, he disarming ly denies\nthat it was ever his intention either\nto be RCS president or ICU president;\n\"I came to College and I was going\nto get a first, pure and simple. I was\ngoing to enjoy my Mathematics, and\nthat was going to be my lifestyle. I also wanted to take part in the social life \u2014 that is when I started to do\nthings in the Hall of Residence.\" His plans were finally shattered\nat the end of his first term. \"It soon\nknocked into me that I wasn't going\nto get a first, and also that Mathematics\nat University was very much different\nfrom the Maths I'd done at school, far more intense, and I couldn't spend\nas much time on it as I'd initially\nthought\".\nSo, Pete settled down to take part\nfully in College life and thoroughly\nenjoyed himself, a process that has\nbeen continuous to today in his role\nas ICU President - \" a job that is not\nentirely what a lot of people think\". As he sees it, it is a multi-faceted\njob, but he has found one aspect of it\nrather disappointing: the length of his\nterm of office.\n\" Any C CU president should be\nthere, in my opinion, first and foremost as C CU president, and secondly\nas VP of ICU\".\" One of the first things I learnt when\ncoming into office was how short a year is. I went to the Bristol Sabbatical\nOfficers' Conference and the first\nthing I realised was how little I could\nchange in a year, how few concrete\nthings I could look back on and say,\" that' s because of me\". That has\nbeen re-enforced by the fact that a lot of things coming to fruition this\nyear were started by Norman Sayles two\nyears ago. But I enjoy the job.\n\" I've found, though, that it is\na lot of work, and a lot of it revolves\naround the office. You tend to get tied\nto the office very much\". Consequently,\nhe has not been able to meet as many\npeople as he would have wished. In\nthis sense, he feels he was better off\nas R CSU president \u2014 a role which is\ndrastically different from that of ICU\nPresident, although ICU is very important,\na coming together of the CC U's, he\nstill feels that \" any C CU president\nshould be there, in my opinion, first\nand foremost as C CU president, and\nsecondly as VP of ICU\". Pete received a traditional education;\nhe went to the local primary school \u2014\nin the next road \u2014 and then on to a local grammar school, where, incidentally,\nhe took O level music and art. A bright student, he passed out of grammar\nschool with four A levels, in Maths (2)\nEconomics and Physics. He then had\nto choose between Mathematics and\nEconomics \u2014 he took the former - a choice which he sometimes wonders\nabout.\nSince coming to IC he has not been\nable to pursue music or art, although\nhe still sings, occasionally, in the\nchurch choir when he goes home. (He\nused - to play the saxophone in the\nschool orchestra, but he gave up on\ncoming to IC.) \" The only extracurricular activity I 've pursued since coming to IC was Dramsoc, which I joined in my first year. That' s how I got to know John Downs \u2014 we both\nstarted in Dramsoc at the same time\nas fresher s\".\"...I would like to think I could be\nreasonably successful\". An organisation Pete was actively\ninvolved with for many years is the\nBritish Red Cross Society, of which\nhe is still a member (he joined when he\nwas ten years old). As an officer of\nthe B RCS he visited Finland on an\ninternational work-camp, and he has\nmaintained contact with his friends in\nthe B RCS this Easter they are off\non a barge trip around North Wales.\nHis immediate ambition, on leaving\nIC is, as he puts it, \" to carve myself\nthe beginnings of some sort of career\nand settle down to living in London\noutside of Col leg e.\"\" As for long term prospects, it\nis difficult to tell until you've gone\nout and settled down, but I would like\nto think that | could be reasonably\nsuccessful,\" he says. Pete likes to enjoy himself, and\nis well known as a socialite throughout\nCollege. His reputation has landed\nhim in one or two unfortunate situations,\nthe most memorable of these being at\nlast year's Smoking Concert.\nEarlier, he and Al Littleford (a great friend) had declared \" all out war\"\u2014\nsugar in bed, U \u2014 bends, etc \u2014 on each\nother. At the Smoking Concert, Pete\nexercised what he terms \" president's prerogative\" and became somewhat\ninebriated in an attempt, he says,\" to make the evening a little bit\ndifferent.\" He was subsequently\n'pushed\u2014dragged' onto the stage with\nthe stripper, who then said she would\nlike someone else on stage, and Pete\ndutifully obliged by singling out Al to her, and he too made his impromptu\ndebut.\n\"When he (Al) got halfway up on\nstage I said, 'there you are, Al, you asked\nfor war, you got war.' After Smoking\nConcert we decided to call a permanent\ntruce.\" \"It looks as if IC will decide to stay\nin (NUS), but I think for all the\nwrong reasons\".\" Another time was when Stan\nArnold, the infamous cabaret artist,\ncame to do the ICWA fresher s dinner\nlast year, and stayed in my room. Al had done me in that night, taken my\nU \u2014bend off. But then he (Al) had an\nunusual fit of conscience and climbed\nback into my room and screwed the U \u2014\u2022\nbend back on again, but couldn't get it\non properly. Stan Arnold went off to\nmy room after the cabaret, and he'd got\na stinking cold. Half an hour later\nhe decides to take a couple of aspirins, turns the cold water tap full on, and\ngets water all over his feet. Stan\nPefer Teague, ICU President\ntakes his aspirins and leaves a note on\nthe sink, \" Do not use this sink \u2014\nU \u2014bend leaks.\"\" So I got back and went to bed. I got up, had a wash (in the bathroom)\nand disappeared off to lectures next\nmorning. I told Ian Redwood that Stan\nwas sleeping in my room, to wake him\nup and give him a cup of coffee. So,\nIan went back, but the sign had d is appeared from the sink. Ian walks into\nthe room, and before Stan can say\nanything Ian has gone over to the sink\nand turned the tap full on \u2014 water\neverywhere. Ian turns the tap off and\ngoes out to the landing and borrows a sponge from the cleaner, and mops all\nthe water up with it. Then he wrings out\nthe sponge into the sink \"\nPete became actively involved in\nR CSU through helping Ron Kill build\nthe RCS Rag Float. Then, as he puts it,\nhe got \" conned\" into becoming RCS Ents chairman, in his second year,\nby S&D Puppeteers \u2014 \" the big election rig gers in RCS in those days. Their place has been taken KJ Productions\nthis years.\" But he feels that elections have\ncome round all too soon. Although he\nwill be reluctant to go, it is important,\nhe says, that there is a change every\nyear, because it is a job which constantly needs new ideas and a new\napproach \u2014 stagnation would otherwise\nbe a possibility. The Union has been run this year\nin a very businesslike manner, and\nthis, Pete concurs, helped give the\nUGC visitation a good impression of\nthe Union. The strategy of giving\nacademic problems priority in discussions was something which pleasantly surprised\nthem. \" They were also pleased to see\nthat as well as the academic side, which apparently a lot of student\nunions don't talk about, we were not\nconstantly throwing at them, to quote\nSir Frederick Daniton, the Chairman of the\nUGC,\" theN US line\". His opinion on the NUS topic is\nthat \" it looks as if IC will decide to\nstay in, but I think for all the wrong\nreasons \u2014 these reasons being fears\nabout losing NUS services, such as\nTravel. IC would also stay in because\nthey think that they need, that students\nneed, a national negotiating body, which\nis right. Students do believe that. But\nI don't see that it necessarily has to\nbe a body with the structure of NUS at the moment.\ncontinued on back page\n\n"
