    "content": "felix\nM I L L E N N I A L S\nFriday 3 February 2017 29\nmillennials.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/millennials\nWant some fish in that taco?\nBreddos is certainly the place to\nget your taco filled - baja fish, fried\nchicken or even fried egg are all on\nthe menu at this trendy Barbican joint.\nJoin us for a sensual feast of the finest\nMexican cuisine.\nT\nhere\u2019s this one\nquestion I always\nget asked: how do\nI have the time to\nfit in lectures in the\nmorning, project-work in the afternoon, while\nmanaging an Instagram story\nsaturated with #bloggermail,\npress events and bearded\nbaristas in tiny independent\ncaf\u00e9s in god-knows-where?\nThe answer is \u2013 I don\u2019t\nknow. All I know is that my\ndaily life runs in the time slots\ndictated by my little black\nMoleskine diary, the grey-bor-dered rectangles filled\nwith the worst of squiggles:\nreservation for brunch, a PR\u2019s\ncontact number, deadlines\nfor reviews\u2026 and so on.\nI\u2019m someone who likes to\nmake full use of her 24 hours\n\u2013 answering emails while\nsteering away from the Mormons on my way to lectures,\nediting photos when the professor decides to chat about\nHuel instead of hydrogen fuel,\nvisualizing photoshoot ideas\nwhile dodging pigeons on my\nway home.\nBut why do I keep living this\nbusy, structured lifestyle? It\nmay be my pure passion for\nfood, or the typical HongKong-ese efficiency running\nthrough my veins, or the\nanxiety I inherited from my\nmother (which sometimes\nmakes me miss my Xanax). Or\nperhaps, and paradoxically,\nthe excitement that comes\nfrom spontaneity. Spontaneity, that is when one of those\nplanned time slots suddenly\ngets freed up when a lecturer\ndecides to not come to work,\nas happened last Thursday.\nThat god-sent slot of freedom got my cortisol rushing\nup to my head. It was an\nimperative for me to find\nsomething to fill up those two\nhours. What should I do? Do\nI have work to catch up on?\nAny more emails to answer?\nBooks to read? Exes to stalk?\nThat was the moment when\nthe food-lover side of the\nbrain came to rescue \u2013 Breddos Tacos.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d\ndone such a thing. Yet every\nsingle time these unplanned\nadventures get me feeling\nfuzzy. I ran past the queue\noutside Fusion, slid past a pair\nof Mormons down Exhibition\nRoad, exchanged my lecture\nnotes for my camera and\nhopped on the 30-minute\ntube journey to Barbican.\nWhen I reached the door\nof Breddos Tacos on 82\nGoswell Road, I was quite out\nof breath. And speechless at\nhow the once makeshift taco\nshack in a car park in Hackney had transformed into\nthis hip, stylish, standalone\nsite. The space was filled by\nwooden bar tables, quirky\nwall art and a lightbox shouting \u201cCOCTELES & MEZCAL\u201d.\nI was seated swiftly by the\nwindow looking out to the\nquiet cross road between Old\nStreet and Clerkenwell Road,\nnext to two business men\nsawing through their charred\ncuts of beef from the grill over\nwine and margaritas.\nThe menu and two of their\ndaily salsas arrived with\na friendly waitress, who\nrecommended some of their\nmost popular tacos: masa\nfried chicken, baja fish and\nfried egg, plus a refreshing seasonal hibiscus and\nrosehip agua fresca. I went\ncilantro and lime. The fried\negg taco came on its own\nwhite plate, the egg in a\nperfect circle on the soft corn\ntortilla with a bright orange\nyolk balancing on top.\nAfter an obligatory round\nof photos, my growling\nstomach urged me to grab\nthe fish taco. The tortilla itself\nwas the size of my palm,\ndisproportionate with the size\nof the fried fish. I folded the\ntortilla in half, trying to keep\nall the cabbage and lime\nmayonnaise goodness inside.\nAt that point, I knew that all\ntable manners or any \u201cladyness\u201d had no control over\nthis meal. I took a gigantic\nbite. The party of flavours\nburst in my mouth: juices from\nthe fish, sweetness from the\ncabbage, tang from the lime\nand the heat from the pico\nde gallo salsa. I took a sip of\nagua fresca to calm the heat\nand continued. The whole\ntaco was demolished in 30\nseconds.\nSame happened for the\nfried chicken taco. Except\nthe unexpected fire from the\nhabanero salsa with the spicy,\ncrunchy skin on the chicken.\nChristy Lam\nfor exactly those and waited\npatiently for the food to\ncome.\nDespite it being the peak of\nthe lunch hour, it didn\u2019t take\nlong for my table to be filled\nwith a fiesta of earthenware,\nbright colours and of course,\ntacos. The baja fish and fried\nchicken tacos came as a pair\non a black, glossy plate,\nexcitingly Instagrammable\nwith shreds of red cabbage,\nThe fried egg taco was like\nthe slow dance at the end of\na ball, giving a wonderful\napplause to the excitement\nand fiery heat from before.\nThe yolk burst into an orange\nriver, surrounding the bits of\nqueso fresco, macadamia nut\nmole and herbs.\nI was tempted by dessert\n(come on, leche frita!) but\n\\\\ A party of\nflavours burst into\nmy mouth: juices\nfrom the fish,\nsweetness from the\ncabbage, tang from\nthe lime and heat\nfrom the salsa \\\\\n\\\\ My growling\nstomach urged me\nto grab the fish taco.\nThe tortilla was the\nsize of my palm \\\\\nit was time for the next slot\nof commitments. Breddos\nTacos definitely fulfilled the\nrequirements of my definition\nof spontaneity for a weekday\nafternoon \u2013 an explosion of\ncolours, exotic flavours and\ndelicious food.\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSociety has\nan eating\ndisorder\nEmily-Jane Cramphorn discusses our\ninsidious weight loss culture\nS\nociety has an eating\ndisorder. Sweeping\nstatement, I know,\nbut take a second\nto look at the\nposters next time\nyou get on the tube. Diets,\ncookbooks, meal replacement\nshakes, protein bars, detox\nteas and pretty much anything\nyou can think of claiming to\nbe the answer to your weight\nproblems. Weight problems\nthat you probably don\u2019t have.\nWe are constantly bombarded with the idea that we\nshould be thinner; that tummy\nrolls are going to kill us and\nthat becoming lighter is the\nkey to health. We spend hours\nobsessing over what we should\nand shouldn\u2019t eat, counting\ncalories and reading up on\nmiracle weight loss regimes.\nWe waste millions of pounds\nof weight loss teas, diet pills\nand meal replacement shakes\nadvertised by beautiful, and\n\\\\ Our entire society is\nafflicted with the distorted\nrelationship with hunger and\nfood \\\\\nmost definitely photoshopped,\nwomen who are being paid a\nfortune to say it has made them\nthin. We demonise gluten, fat,\nsugar and pretty much anything that tastes good. Carbs\nare replaced with courgettes\nand we use apps to track all\nour calories in and out. Food is\ncategorised as good and bad\nand the ultimate goal is to take\nup less space, eat fewer calories and consist of less matter.\nWe constantly measure and\ncompare ourselves, we glorify\nthe idea of restriction and self\ncontrol, and tend to be guided\nby the notion that less is more.\nEverywhere we look, weight\nloss is being thrust upon us,\nwhether or not we actually\nneed to lose weight.\nIf society were a person,\nundoubtedly it would be\ndiagnosed with an eating dis-order: so many of the things\nthat our society promotes are\nbehaviours chastised in eating\ndisorder units and that treatment programs force their\npatients to change. It is not\nhealthy to obsess about food,\nto eliminate entire food groups\nor to force your body to exist\nbelow its natural weight. Meal\nreplacement shakes are great\nfor on the go snacks, to get in\nextra nutrients when you exercise heavily or on days when\nyou don\u2019t have time to cook,\nbut they should not be used\nas an alternative to food. Our\nbodies are designed to digest\nsolid food, thus, surviving of\nliquid nutrition can cause an\narray of digestive problems,\nnot to mention fostering an\nunhealthy relationship with\nfood. There is a reason why\neating disorder patients are\npushed to eat solids over\nliquid or enteral nutrition.\nLikewise, whilst processed\nfood often contains far too\nmuch sugar, humans have\nevolved to utilise carbohydrates as their main source of\nenergy. Thus, cutting carbs is\nboth unhealthy and unsustainable in the long term. It\u2019s called\nketo because you go into keto-sis, a state at which your body\nbreaks down fat stores, including the essential ones, to form\nketones in order to fuel itself.\nWhilst this isn\u2019t immediately\nharmful, in the long term it can\neventually cause muscle loss,\nreduced metabolic rate and\ndeadly pH changes. What is\nmore, prolonged ketosis forces\nthe body into \u2018starvation mode\u2019\nand will only make you gain\nmore weight in the long run. It\nsounds like an old wives' tale\nbut I can assure you that it is a\nreal risk \u2013 check out the Minnesota starvation experiment.\nI could go on to rant about\nwhy detox teas are quite literally s**t or why diet pills\nare stupid but that is not why\nI chose to write this article.\nThe point I want to make is\nthat people come in different\nshapes and sizes, some of us\nare heavier than others but\nheavier doesn\u2019t mean less\nhealthy. Many people with an\noverweight BMI are perfectly\nhealthy, whilst others in the\n\u2018normal\u2019 range are damaging\ntheir body by forcing it to be\nthere. Our bodies have a genetically determined set point\nand BMI is simply a measure\nof how your height to weight\nratio compares to that of the\nrest of the population. BMI is\ngood for identifying extremes\nbut is largely an unreliable predictor of health. Indeed, some\nstudies have identified that\nbeing slightly overweight can\nreduce the risk of disease. Ultimately, if you\u2019re having to go\nhungry or obsess over intake\nso as to be a certain weight,\nthe likelihood is that it is not\nyour optimum weight.\nWe live in a society where\nthe numbers that are on the\nscales and stitched into our\nclothes determine the food\nthat we eat. We obsess about\nfood and dieting all of the time\nand, by and large, have forgotten how to eat intuitively. They\nsay one of the key indicators\nof eating disorders is skewed\nhunger cues and poor perception of satiety, but honestly,\nI think our entire society is\nafflicted with the distorted\nrelationship with hunger and\nfood. Food is not something\nthat needs to be earned using\na currency of exercise. Unless\nmedically advised, we should\nnot need to use apps and diet\nplans to dictate what we eat.\nMore importantly, we should\nnot be assigning moral worth\nto food or confusing weight\nloss with the pursuit of health.\nI\u2019m not saying we should\nlive off McDonald's and chocolate cake alone, but eating\nMcDonald's and chocolate\ncake doesn\u2019t mean you have\nbeen bad. Nutrition is all\nabout moderation, enjoyment\nand listening to your body\n\u2013 things that seem to be condemned by the clean eating\nand 'fitspo' movements. Similarly, I acknowledge that for\nsome, weight loss is a necessary factor in their pursuit of\nhealth, but heavy and healthy\nare not mutually exclusive.\nSo next time you feel bad\nabout your tummy tub or for\neating one too many custard\ncreams, remember that health\ncomes in all shapes and sizes\nand is engendered by a flex-ible, instinctive and balanced\napproach to food.\n\\\\ Many people\nwith an overweight\nBMI are perfectly\nhealthy, whilst others\nin the 'normal' range\nare damaging their\nbody by forcing it to\nbe there \\\\\n\\\\ So many of the\nthings that our\nsociety promotes are\nbehaviours chastised\nin eating disorder\nunits and that\ntreatment programs\nforce their patients\nto change \\\\\n\\\\ We should not\nbe assigning moral\nworth to food or\nconfusing weight loss\nwith the pursuit of\nhealth \\\\\n\n"

We carefully selected\nthis week to talk about food, because Eating\nDisorder Awareness Week is coming up. Now if you\u2019re\nclued up you might say \u201cBut isn\u2019t EDAW at the end\nof February? Is this a miscalculation? It feels like a\nmiscalculation. Lef, you literally have one job.\u201d\nAlthough my instinctive reply to such vicious\naccusations would be something along the lines\nof \u201cSHUT UP\u201d, the honest *cough* truth *cough*\nis that we wanted to get you thinking about food in\nadvance of EDAW, so that when your newsfeed starts\noverflowing with Guardian think-pieces on society\u2019s\nrelationship with food in a few weeks\u2019 time, you can\nrevel in smugness. Yes. This was totally intentional.\nYup.\nIn all fairness, given the recent political climate, what\nwith May and Trump holding hands and all that, we\ndid consider (and certainly had the opportunity of)\ncontinuing along the themes of political awareness\nand resistance, postponing some of the food heavy\ncontent that\u2019s featured this week. However, we have\nto admit that the political situation will remain volatile\nfor the foreseeable future. These are themes that will\npermeate most coming issues, one way or another,\nand this will be mirrored in the articles you read in the\npaper.\nBut enough about politics for the moment (back to the\nstreets on Saturday). This paper is about food. Prepare\nfor a rollercoaster of emotion. You will experience\nhunger, you will feel disgust, you will try and suppress\nsexual arousal, you will feel disgust again, and then\nfeel hungry and then confused and by the end of this\nissue you will find yourself questioning everything\nyou ever thought you thought you knew you thought\n(has your mind exploded with anticipation yet? And\nby mind I mean pants). So please, dig in. Take your\nseat at the table, roll your sleeves up and don\u2019t get up\nunless it\u2019s for seconds.

If\nthose are the kind of things\nyou\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re\ngoing to be disappointed.\nOn the other hand, JLA\nis able to deliver on all the\nthings it was touted on. The\nanimation is crisp and fluid\nand all the action sequences\nare impressive. Though the art\nstyle may seem simplistic at\nfirst glance, in motion, all the\ncharacters appear fine.\nThat said, a lot of other\nadaptations have brilliant\naction scenes, but luckily,\nthis show is able to provide\nsomething more in the form\nof humour and character\ndynamics. Though Superman, Wonder Woman and\nBatman take centre stage,\nthey guest star with sorts of\nheroes from DC Comics, from\nthe headstrong Firestorm to\nthe foul mouthed Constantine\n(whose cleverly written to\nbe kid-friendly and still as\nyou\u2019d expect him to be). The\nclash of personalities, as the\nheroes are thrust into all sorts\nof zany situations, is fun. The\nfeaturing the same atmosphere\nand music. In general, all the\ncharacters come alive and feel\nlike they have genuine distinct\npersonalities.\nThis isn\u2019t a story driven show,\nnor is it a fitting replacement for\nthe previous series. At the same\ntime, it never pretends to be anything other than what it is, a fun\nshow for all-ages where colourful action and character banter\nare the name of the game.\ncast contains a mix of veteran\nand new voice actors, all of\nwhom give solid performances.\nIt is well worth hearing Kevin\nConroy as Batman again after\nadaptations like the Arkham\nvideo games.

Instead of\ncomplaining that certain contestants shouldn\u2019t have been\nput out when they did, people\ntended to agree that while it\nwas a shame, they didn\u2019t\nhave their best week so it\nwas only fair. Big Brother\nhad Jade Goody\u2019s\nracist incident, Bake\nOff had BinGate.\nThe news that the\nshow would be moving\nto Channel 4 from\nBBC 1 displayed quite\nnicely the difference in\nthe public perception of\neach channel.

Indeed, this\nterm, coined international\nword of 2016 by Oxford\ndictionary has recently been\nappearing in headlines\nworldwide as a new way\nof thinking about science in\nthis new world we live in. A\nworld in which \u2013 post-truth\ndefenders claim \u2013 objective\nfacts are less influential in\nshaping the public than\nemotional appeals. Many\nsee the election of Trump,\ndespite his dismissal of what\nwe often see as clear-cut\nscience facts (see vaccination\nand climate change) as an\nexemplification of this new\nworld order. They see it as\na time of crisis in the science\ncommunity, brought about by\nthe ongoing war between the\neducated liberal left and the\nignorant conservative right,\nand an opportunity to reform\nit. Some even venture to\nclaim that science is partially\nresponsible for this change\nin world order. Even before\nthe US election, Nature\nmagazine columnist Colin\nMacilwain stated, \u201cIf Donald\nTrump were to trigger a\ncrisis in Western democracy,\nscientists would need to look\nat their part in its downfall\u201d.\nHas science become out of\ntouch with society, or vice-versa? Is 21st\ncentury science\nreally post-truth? A little\nanalysis on the nature of\nscientific enquiry itself helps\nto answer these questions.\nFirstly, to claim that science\nis gearing towards the post-truth implies two things: that\nscientific knowledge is true\nand that, throughout history,\nscientific truths have been\nreadily accepted by society.\nMost philosophers, however,\nincluding one of the 20th\ncentury\u2019s leading ones, Thomas\nKuhn, agree that science\ndoes not present truths but\nparadigms \u2013 set of conventions by which knowledge\nbuilds in an orderly fashion\nto complete a certain world\nview established by a founding figure \u2013 say, Newton or\nDarwin. Inherent in definition\nis the fact that revolutions\nhappen, and therefore\nparadigm shifts occur when\nnew theories are substantiated with sufficient evidence,\nsuch as Einstein\u2019s theories\noverthrowing Newton\u2019s and\nredefining most of physics.\nThe development of the theories behind atoms, the Solar\nsystem or gravity all exemplify this changing nature of\nscientific knowledge- there is\nno truth, just theories substantiated with enough evidence\nuntil the next Rutherford,\nCopernicus or Newton came\nalong with better experiments\nto perfect upon them.\nIt is also a bit ridiculous to\nclaim that this \u201cpost-truth\u201d\nidea is a new thing in the\nworld of science. Theories,\nno matter how well-backed\nup, have historically taken\nreal revolutions, defiance and\nlives to become integrated\ninto popular knowledge.\nAlfred Wegener died thirty\nyears before his theory of\ncontinental drift became part\nof mainstream science. Aristachus\u2019 work on the Heliocentric\ntheory, dating as far back\nas ancient Greece, would\nstay forgotten for almost 2\nmillennia until Copernicus\ncame along, who then again\nsaw rejection from most of the\nscientific community during\nhis lifetime. Darwin has a\nGalapagos-sized amount\nof evidence and yet public\nschools in 14 states in the\nUS still don\u2019t mention his\nevolutionary theory in their\ncurriculum. Galileo Galilei\nspent the latter part of his\nlife under house arrest by\nthe Roman Inquisition for\nsupporting geocentrism. Talk\nabout 21st-century post-truth\nto them.\nThose defending that\nscience needs a reform in\ncurrent times point out that\nscience has become out of\ntouch with society. It seems\nto me however, that never\nhas it been more in touch. A\nrapidly increasing proportion\nof scientific papers are freely\navailable online, university\nF\nact: You can win\n$1,000,000 if you\nhave \u2018supernatural\nabilities\u2019.\nThe \u201cMillion Dollar\nParanormal Challenge\u201d is offered to anyone\nwho can demonstrate a\nsupernatural ability under\nagreed-upon scientific testing\ncriteria. In 40 years, despite\nover 1000 applicants, no one\never won.\nThe prize was offered\nby James Randi, a famous\nmagician, escape artist and\ndebunker of pseudoscience\nand the paranormal. It\nstarted off as a throwaway\ncomment in an interview, and\nsnowballed into a 1k, then\n10k, then 100k and now 1\nmillion dollar prize. Plenty of\nmediums, dowsers and mind\nreaders have stepped up to\nthe plate, although according\nto Mr Randi very few of them\never consider that their failure\nto complete the testing might\nbe due to the fact that they\nlack supernatural powers,\ninstead blaming sunspots and\ngeomagnetic variables\u2026\nThink you have a gift?\nUnfortunately you\u2019ve missed\nthe chance to make your mil-lion; following his retirement,\nthe James Randi Educational\nFoundation has elected to\nwithdraw the challenge,\ninstead putting the money\naside for grants to non-profit\ngroups that promote critical\nthinking. I guess that means\nhe won the bet.\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\n\\\\ Never has\nscience been\nmore in touch with\nsociety \\\\\nTwoFrogs\nonaBench\nSara Hamilton\n\\\\ Theories no\nmatter how well-backed up, have\nhistorically taken\nreal revolutions,\ndefiance and lives to\nbecome integrated\ninto popular\nknowledge \\\\\nwebsites are overflowing\nwith information about current research and there\u2019s a\nmagnificent infinite online\nencyclopedia called Google\nto answer everyone\u2019s ques-tions. It takes a two minute\nYouTube video to understand\nthe concept of climate change\nand the mountain of evidence\nbehind it.\nThe real problem is not that\nsociety does not understand\nscience, or believe that\nscientists should hang around\nin their labs all day and write\nabout their feelings, but that\nscience does not always\nsuit everyone\u2019s interests.\nSame as evolution didn\u2019t do\ngreat things for Christianism\nideologically, climate change\ndoesn\u2019t mean great things for\nthe industries economically.\nTrump is not repealing climate\nprotection policies because\nscientists are failing to present\nevidence, but because burning coal is cheap. Blaming\nscience is not the answer,\nprotesting against the \u201cinconvenient-facts-avoiding\u201d is.\n\\\\ Blaming science\nis not the answer,\nprotesting against\nthe \u201cinconvenientfacts-avoiding\u201d is \\\\\n\\\\ Missy\n\n"

Well,\nto one of the five shortlisted\nentries, that is. These are\ncurrently up for display (in\nminiature-sized versions) in\nthe National Gallery, and\nit makes for an exhibition\nwell-worth perusing, before\nheading upstairs to drool over\nthe Monets and Van Goghs.\nHaving housed a diverse\nand generally eye-catching\nstatuary in the past \u2013\nincluding a skeletal horse, a\ntorso-bust, a rocking horse,\nand even a big blue cock \u2013\nthe plinth currently supports\nDavid Shrigley\u2019s giant\n\u2018thumbs-up\u2019 sign, something\nI suppose most London folks\nthe message is short, simple,\nand hard-hitting. Among the\nvarious gallery-wanderers\nthat I chanced to speak to, it\nwas the most popular, and I\ncan see why \u2013 it is elegant,\naesthetic, and harkens back\nto the values of an art form\nthat died out with the birth\nof contemporary sculpture.\nPerhaps it is too old-fash-ioned, and in this way risks\nsubverting its own message,\nappearing more like nostalgic\nyearning than subversion and\nprogress.\nThe next in line (as per my\narbitrary ordering) is Michael\nRakowitz\u2019s The Invisible\nEnemy Should Not Exist, a\ndepiction of the Assyrian\nwinged-bull deity that stood\nat the entrance to Nineveh,\nand was destroyed by ISIS at\nMosul museum. This version\nwill be made out of Iraqi\ndate-syrup cans, representing\nan industry that withered\naway due to the Iraq wars.\nIt is a colourful, exotic piece,\nand I see the appeal. Meant\nto \u2018carry on\u2026Nineveh\u2019s\npast\u2019, the sculpture hopes\nto eventually move to Iraq\nfor a permanent home. So\nwhy London? Why Trafalgar\nSquare? To me, it seems\na little out-of-place, and I\nrack my brains to see how it\nrepresents London\u2019s vibrant,\nmodern, and metropolitan\nvibe. It is a little too PC, a\nlittle too contrived (made out\nof date-syrup cans for added\nsymbolism?), and a little too\ntame for my tastes.\nSpeaking of tame, the\nedge returns with Heather\nPhillipson\u2019s The End, a giant\nglob of cream with a cherry\non top and a fully-functioning\ndrone on top of said cherry.\nYes, a drone. On a cherry.\nOn a glob of cream. Oh, and\na stray fly, perched atop this\nmonstrosity. There is definitely\nsomething sharp and satirical\nabout this piece, and feels\nmore in line with the spirit\nof contemporary London; it\nreflects the social uncertainty\nand political instability of not\nonly the British Isles but the\nworld entirely, and the general unease over government\nand surveillance that has\nbecome almost one of the\ndefining characteristics of our\ngeneration.

Apparently it \u2018connects\u2019 to African art, Picasso,\nand Rodin, among others.\nAlas, I am not sure of the\naesthetic value of this work,\nnor the message it hopes to\nconvey. Thanks to this, High\nWay is only the second-most\nunconvincing piece among\nthe five.\nI won\u2019t mention who I voted\nfor (yes, the public can \u2018vote\u2019\non their favourite and their\ncomments are even \u2018taken\ninto consideration\u2019!) because\nI don\u2019t want to influence my\nesteemed readership any\nmore than I have already.

We present to you five excellent ways to prepare\nthis sublime ingredient, as well as a comprehensive breakdown of why it is notably superior to all\nother tubers.\nStuffed potatoes\nIngredients:\n4 baking potatoes\nBacon\nShredded cheese\n2 eggs\n1 bell pepper\nBlack pepper\nSalt\n1 tsp olive oil\nLet the potatoes boil for\n20-25 minutes in salty water.\nBefore taking them out, check\nif they are cooked through.\nInsert a fork \u2013 it should easily\ngo the whole way through.\nThere is a fine equilibrium: if\nthey are too HARD, you won\u2019t\nbe able too use them, but if\nthey are too soft, they are\nuseless.\nAfter they are boiled, cut\nthem into halves. I prefer to\ncut them in two cups, but I\nthink it\u2019s easier, at least at\nthe beginning, to cut them\nlengthways. Use a spoon to\nscoop out the inside of the\npotato into a bowl. Be careful\nnot to take all of it out \u2013 you\nstill should have 1 cm or so on\nthe margins. Yes, this is why\nyou need big potatoes! Also,\nbe careful not to smash them\ninto pieces \u2013 it happens even\nto the best of us.\nAdd some salt and pepper\nto the bowl along with the\npotatoes. Truth be said, there\nare so many ways to stuff\nthem that I can\u2019t choose just\none!\nMethod 1: mix the insides\nof the potatoes with the finely\nchopped bacon, pepper and\nonions. Fill the potato jackets\nwith mixture. Drizzle a bit\nof olive oil on top, and cook\neverything in the preheated\noven (200\u00b0C) for 10 minutes.\nBeat the eggs in a bowl and\nadd the cheese. Carefully,\npour this mixture into the\npotatoes and let them cook\nfor 10 more minutes.\nMethod 2: add the finely\nAndrada Balmez and\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nRosemary potatoes\nIngredients:\n8-10 medium potatoes\n1-2 tsp Olive oil\nButter\nRosemary\nSalt\nThis is probably the easiest\nway to cook potatoes. First,\npreheat the oven at 175.\nPeel and chop the potatoes\ninto smallish pieces. After\narranging them on a tray,\npour some olive oil \u2013 not too\nmuch. Sprinkle with chopped\nrosemary and a bit of salt.\nIn my opinion, those are the\nonly things you need to add,\nbut you can experiment with\npepper and chilli or God\nknows what other condiments\nyou fancy.\nLet the potatoes cook inside\nthe oven for 15-25 minutes \u2013\nyou should check them from\ntime to time after 15 minutes\nto make sure they don\u2019t burn!\nMashed potato\nIngredients:\n400g small potatoes\n1 medium squash\n200g evaporated milk\n200g butter\nSalt\nFresh parsley leaves\nWell, I know I said that this\nis going to be a recipe about\nmashed potatoes, but mashed\npotatoes are b-o-r-i-n-g without some great gravy and no\none has time to make great\ngravy whenever they cook\nmashed potatoes. I always\nchoose to mix the potatoes\nwith some squash for extra\ntastiness but if you don\u2019t like\nit, you can just get rid of it\nand still follow the steps.\nBoil the (peeled) potatoes until they are soft. Peel\nand chop the squash. In a\nseparate pot, boil the squash\ncubes. When they are soft,\ntake the potatoes and the\nsquash and mash them. Now,\nI know that you are a student\nand you might not have the\nright instrument, but you can\neasily use a fork. And a bit of\nbrute force.\nAdd the butter and the milk\nto the mixture until it softens.\nYou know, the more the\nmerrier, so you should add\nas much as you can \u2013 just be\ncareful not to make a soup\ninstead of mashed potatoes.\nTo finish, use your already\nwell developed skills at salting\nfood. For extra deliciousness,\nsprinkle some finely chopped\nparsley leaves on top.\nPotato stew\nIngredients\n3 medium potatoes\n2-3 big carrots\n1 parsnip\n250g green peas\n1 pear\n1 beef stock cube\nPepper\nSalt\nCumin\nWell, honestly, this one is a\nbit of cheating when it comes\nto potatoes, but it\u2019s still a\ngreat way of serving Eastern\nEurope\u2019s favourite food \u2013 and\nI can say that without being\nracist or xenophobic as I\ncome from there.\nThe only thing you need for\nthis one is a) a pot that can be\nused in the oven b) a bit more\ntime \u2013 so, don\u2019t try this if you\nare starving c) either luck to\nnot start a fire when leaving\nthe oven unattended (which I\nobviously don\u2019t recommend,\nbut hey, we are all humans\nand hence, we make mistakes\n\u2013 or some power to study in\nPotato salad\nIngredients:\n6-7 medium sized potatoes\n2-3 Spring onions\n3 eggs\nbacon bits\nparsley leaves\n4-5 medium basil leaves\nsalt\npepper\nHard-boil the eggs and the\npotatoes. Peel the eggs, and\ndice into medium cubes along\nwith the potatoes. Chop the\nspring onions, the parsley and\nbasil leaves. Mix everything\nin a reasonably sized bowl.\nAdd the bacon bits and salt\nand pepper to taste.\nCongratulations! Now you\nhave a nice lunch you can\neither take to school or enjoy\nin the silence of your room.\nIf you are an animal (which\nyou probably are, unless you\nare a plant or an enormous\nbacterium), you might want\nto add some mayonnaise \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t, as I\u2019m not a savage.\nT\nhe humble spud.\nWhere to start? How\nmany foodstuffs can\ncompare to the tuber\nthat brought a whole\nnation to its knees \u2013\nand I\u2019m not talking about the\nIrish potato famine, but rather\nthe introduction of potatoes\nto haute cuisine. People had\nbeen searching for a starch\nthat was affordable yet\namazing, could be roasted\nas easily as boiled, and in all\npreparations had the same\ndelicious taste \u2013 the potato\nhad it all.\nIndeed, being first cultivated\nin Peru, it was this that the\nSpanish conquistadors\nsearched for \u2013 not El Dorado,\nbut El Potato (city of potato).\nJealously hoarded by their\nIncan growers, a fierce battle\nwould rage culminating in\nthe genocide of an entire\nrace just for the acquisition\nof a tuber, an event never\nduplicated until the great\nJerusalem artichoke battles of\nthe mid 1700\u2019s #altfacts.\nSuch is the way of the world\n\u2013 we were fortunate that\nthe Spanish throne spread\nthe potato far and wide,\nlanding on British shores in\nthe 1500\u2019s and it has thrived\nhere ever since. But why is it\nso popular?\nCompared to their orange\ncousins the sweet potato, it is\nless saccharine \u2013 but this is\ntruly an advantage, for it enables it to pair excellently with\nmeat, and shun marshmallows\nentirely. Yams, the hairy,\nwrinkled uncles to our divine\ntuber are simply too repulsive\nwhen poorly cooked, and\nthough their nutty flavour is\nadmirable, they can be easily\nset aside when compared to a\nfluffy, golden roastie.\nthe kitchen and tend to the\noven.\nFirst, peel what must be\npeeled, wash what must\nbe washed and then chop\neverything in equal sizes \u2013\nnow, you\u2019ll be thinking: am I\nsupposed to cut everything in\nthe same size and shape as\nthe peas? Ha. Ha. You are my\nguest, if you want, but I think\nthat you know what I meant\nand I am not even bothering\nto further explain. You are\na smart Imperial student,\nriiiight?\nPut everything in the pot,\nadd one or two cups of water,\nso everything is covered a\nbit. Spice it up. Let cook in\nthe oven for one hour (more\nor less, depending on how\nbig you cut everything and\nhow fresh the veggies are),\nwhile you are studying those\nintegrals and don\u2019t leave the\noven unattended. I mean, you\ncan, but if you do that and the\nfire alarm starts, karma will\nstrike back in the exams.\nObviously, when ready,\nserve with meat!\n\\\\ Spanish\nconquistadors\nsearched not for\nEl Dorado, but El\nPotato (\u201ccity of\npotato\u201d) \\\\\nchopped bacon, pepper,\nonion (and some extra\nveggie, because now you\nhave plenty of space inside;\nI recommend: slices of tomatoes and diced carrot) Pour\nsome olive oil on the top. Put\nin the oven for ten minutes.\nAdd the beaten eggs mixed\nwith shredded cheese before\nletting them cook for extra 10\nminutes.\nMethod 3: use your imagi-nation! When I like to feel a\nbit more sophisticated, I fill\nthem with unexpected things.\nMelon and crispy bacon\nare a nice combination, or\nspinach and cheese. Cook the\nspinach before and mix with\na soft cheese like Feta cheese\nand then stuff the potatoes\nwith it; sprinkle some extra\nmozzarella on top of it before\nbaking. Or pears soaked in\nrum and a good old cheese.\nReally, the possibilities are\ninfinite! The only limit is your\nimagination.\nP.S. if you don\u2019t want to\nthrow away the inside of the\npotatoes but really don\u2019t have\nspace for them anymore, you\ncan just mix them with butter\nand make them into small\nballs that can be cooked in\nthe oven for 15 minutes. If\nyou really like cheese \u2013 I\nmean, who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 you\ncan stuff cheese in the middle\nof them.\n\\\\ Yams, the hairy,\nwrinkled uncles to\nour divine tuber are\nsimply too repulsive\nwhen poorly\ncooked, though\ntheir nutty flavour is\nadmirable \\\\\n\\\\ A starch that\nis affordable yet\namazing, could be\nroasted as easily as\nboiled, and in all\npreparations had\nthe same delicious\ntaste \u2013 the potato\nhas it all \\\\\nI just want to roll around in them and enjoy their earthy goodness\nWorship me\n...\nyou filth\nAll hail the vegetable monarch,\nQueen Potato\n\n"

My\ndecision for this was mostly\ndriven by a concern for\nthe planet. The Food and\nAgriculture Organisation\nof the UN estimates that\n14.5% of global greenhouse\ngas emissions come from\nthe livestock industry. The\nfinancial implications of\nnot buying meat were also\nextremely satisfying (you can\nbuy two kilos of dried beans\nfor a couple of quids and\nthat turns into a lot of food).\nHaving said that, becoming\na committed vegetarian\nwasn\u2019t so easy \u2014 not for the\nfirst couple of months at least.\nFormerly, I was someone\nwho really enjoyed eating\nmeat. And living with other\nmeat eaters was not easy,\nthe smells of cooking would\nmake my stomach pang.\nBorough Market was a no\ngo. A common experience\namongst recently turned\nherbivores is a foreboding\nanxiety that you will never\n\\\\ There are uncountable\nreasons why it is better for\nthe planet to be vegan \\\\\n\\\\ I realised how\nmuch dairy eaters\nstink (you smell a\nlot worse than you\nthink!) \\\\\n\\\\ I still accept\nthat my western\nlifestyle relies on\na great deal of\nenvironmental\ndestruction and\nhuman and animal\noppression \\\\\nfeel full again; you convince\nyourself that there is no food\nthat will satiate your appetite\nlike meat could. I replaced\nthat hole with emetic\nquantities of chocolate and\nbiscuits. A Lidl trip would\nbe a conveyor belt full of\nvegetables chased by a\nstack of twelve or fifteen\n30p chocolate bars.\nBut those feelings go pretty\nquickly (as if you thought that\nsaving the planet was going\nto be easy?*). Give it a\ncouple of months. And in all\nhonesty, after three I found\nmyself utterly repulsed by the\nsmell of cooking meat, never\nmind the thought of eating a\nkilled animal.\nAfter not too long, I cut\neating dairy. I didn\u2019t mean\nit as any kind of actual commitment \u2014 I would never\nhave used the word vegan,\nit felt so loaded, so critical\nof everyone else. My thinking\nwas that cutting dairy would\nbe easy \u2013 I have a lifelong\nphobia of wet milk and I\nnever trusted supermarket\neggs (\u201cfree-range\u201d doesn\u2019t\nmean much). And seeing as I\ncook just about all the food I\neat, I very happily went without dairy. For a few months\nat least.\nIt all fell apart when I went\nhome during the summer: my\nparents had cruelly filled the\nfridge with lots and lots of\ndelicious cheese. And out of\nLondon, the only non-meat\nto eat at pubs is mac and\ncheese or vegetable lasagne\n(which comes with a whole\nlot more cheese). Eggs were\nan issue, made prominent\nby my mum\u2019s insistence that\nthe \u201clovely eggs\u201d from her\n\u201clovely chickens\u201d were reasonably ecologically secure\n\u2014 besides, they were lovely.\nI finally resolved that when\nI came back down, I\u2019d avoid\ndairy. From being vegetar-ian, this turned out to be quite\neasy and very satisfying. My\nskin was instantly better, I felt\na lot better in my self. Also,\nI realised how much dairy\neaters stink (you smell a lot\nworse than you think!). Not\nrequiring animals in your\nfood chain is also incredibly\nsatisfying. There are literally\nuncountable reasons why it\nis better for the planet to be\nvegan, and I could just do\na long list here, but to save\nthis article from becoming\ntoo preachy I\u2019ll just mention\none thing.\nWhilst vegetarianism is a\ngreat way to greatly shrink\nyour ecological footprint,\nyou\u2019re still relying on domesticated animals. We\u2019re\ncurrently living in an age\nof mass extinction, the total\nmass of all the humans on the\nEarth is around seven times\nthat of all the other wild\nterrestrial animals together,\nand the mass of domesticated animals is twice that\nof humans. I strongly feel\nthat domesticated animals\nare very distinct from their\nwild counterparts, they have\nbeen humanised \u2014 bred to\nbe useful rather than necessarily healthy or happy\n(and there is overwhelming\nevidence for emotional intel-ligence, particularly amongst\nthe large mammals which are\nmost \u201cuseful\u201d to us). Growing\nup in the countryside I was\nalready aware of the gaunt\nmisery of dairy cattle, and\nin London of the deformed\ndogs, inbred to make cute,\nperpetually juvenile pets.\nHumans and their animals\noutweigh the wildlife, with\nwhom we share the Earth's\nsurface, by more than twenty\ntimes. And without being too\npreachy (I have, haven\u2019t I?),\nit was ethically inescapable that I should turn from\nvegetarian to vegan. Of\ncourse I still accept that my\nwestern lifestyle relies on a\ngreat deal of environmental\ndestruction and human and\nanimal oppression.\nGenerally, people were\nsupportive of my decision,\nthough my friends outside of\nLondon took a great deal of\nthe piss (less than I\u2019d expect\nthough), and my mum insisted\non diagnosing my diet as ort-horexic \u2014 I still haven\u2019t taken\na single vitamin D or B12\nthough (yeah, fuck the nutritional establishment!).\nMy grandparents, on the\nother hand, were far less\nimpressed. When I was going\nround to theirs for tea, I rang\nahead to notify them of my\n\u201ceven more difficult dietary\nsituation\u201d and asked if \u201cthat\nwould be OK?\u201d. My grandmother told me that \u201cit would\nhave to be, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d. Naturally, I assumed by her tone\nthat she was joking, but my\nmum insisted that she really\nwasn\u2019t. At theirs, I ate a separate plate of dhal and rice\n\\\\ I ate a separate\nplate of shal and\nrice while my\ngranddad laid into\nme, out of principle\n(or disappointment) I\nexpect \\\\\nwhile my granddad laid into\nme, out of principle (or dis-appointment) I expect. After\nthat we were all ok though.\nAt Christmas, I cooked a\nseparate nut and lentil Wellington, but my family were\nall very nice about it and my\nsister made the best chocolate cake (Nigella).\nIt is quite easy going vegan,\nand I\u2019ll say it \u2013 go vegan! (Or\nat least stop eating meat).\n*also, remember not to\nbe overtly smug or too\nself-righteous.\nLeave\nTrident\nalone\nCharles Titmuss defends the UK's\nrenewal of (necessarily) scary nuclear\nweapons\nT\nrident was\nannounced as the\nUK\u2019s new deterrent\nback in 1980, and\npatrols with the\nmissile began in\n1994. The renewal of trident\nwas debated in July 2016, to\nreplace the current submarines\nwith the newer Dreadnought\nClass by 2028. The estimated\ncost of the upgraded weapons\nsystem is around \u00a331 billion.\nLast week an article about\nTrident was published in\nfelix. It was focused around\nthe fact that the government\nlied to MPs and the general\npublic ahead of a crucial\nvote on whether or not to\nrenew Trident. This denial\nof information was undoubtedly outrageous, as it is a\ncritical aspect of the nation\u2019s\ndefence as well as a colossal\ninvestment, and the public\nhas a right to know whether\nit is effective or not.\nHowever, at this point, the\narticle and I diverge, due to\nits suggestion that this failure would and should alter\nour opinions as to the utility of the Trident deterrent\nas well as several factual\ninaccuracies: there was a\nsingle missile as opposed to\nmany, and an error in the\ninput data led to the failure of the targeting. These\nare serious technical issues\nthat should be resolved, but\nthe article trotted out the\nclassic tropes of an anti-nu-clear weapons argument:\nthis failed launch shows\nthey don\u2019t work, they\u2019re\nnot necessary because the\nUSSR doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\nsmart weapons don\u2019t work\nand that the real threats are\ncyber and terrorism, etc.\n\\\\ They are an excellent\nexample of creating peace\nthrough fear \\\\\nThis misunderstanding of\nthe weapon system and its\npurpose in the geopolitical\nsphere is fundamental to this\nargument. Its assumption is\nthat nukes are terrifying and\ntherefore they are terrible\nand everyone should get\nrid of them. They miss the\npoint that that is the point of\nnukes: they\u2019re fucking terri-fying. They are so terrifying\nthat no nation is willing to\nrisk unleashing them on\nanother. Frankly, they are an\nexcellent example of creating peace through fear, and\nultimately it is a sad indictment on humanity itself.\nThey are also a proven\ntechnology. The Trident\nsystem employed by the\nRoyal Navy has undergone\n161 successful tests with\nfewer than 10 confirmed fail-ures. These tests have mostly\nbeen carried out by the US,\nwhich uses the same weapon\nsystem as the Royal Navy.\nThe earliest ballistic missiles\nwere the V2s, famously used\nin World War II to make\nlife difficult for Londoners.\nSmart weapons really are\na thing. Just look at any\nmodern weapon system and\nit contains enough tech to\nfly a missile through a small\nwindow. If I\u2019m honest I find\nthat fact pretty sickening.\nThe National Security\nStrategy Document, published in 2010, does rate\nterrorism and cybercrime as\nthe greatest threats to the\nUK. However, this can be\nsimply explained by the fact\nthat nukes counter the threat\nfrom aggressive nation\nstates directly whereas\n\\\\ That is the point\nof nukes: they're\nfucking terrifying.\nThey are so\nterrifying that no\nnation is willing to\nrisk unleashing them\non another \\\\\ncyber and terrorist attacks\nare a more complex issue to\ncounter. They are, by their\nvery nature, diverse and\nunpredictable, and often the\nmeasures that law enforcement say they require to\ncombat them infringe our\ncivil liberties to an uncomfortable degree, as revealed\nby Edward Snowden.\nAs for the argument that\nthe USSR is gone and now\neverything is fine, please\nsee North Korea, Russia or\nChina for an example of an\nantagonistic nuclear state.\nRussia\u2019s actions in Crimea,\nNorth Korea\u2019s development\nof ever more potent nuclear\nweapons and China\u2019s island\nclaims in the South China\nSea demonstrate just how\nvolatile the international situation is. Although we do not\nface the ideological threat of\nthe USSR in the same way as\nwe once did, that does not\nmean we no longer require\nthese weapons for a long\nterm insurance policy.\nNuclear weapons are an\nexcellent deterrent, albeit\na horrifying one. They are\nused daily as one of the submarines patrols the oceans,\npreventing threats from\nnation state actors. Trident is\nnot a fix-all weapons system:\nit could and should be made\ncheaper, it should be 100%\nreliable and it is a horrifying solution to the issue of\nwar, but, in the main, it does\nwork.\nI do not support the current\nUS administration\u2019s proposal\nto expand the nuclear arse-nal. A few nukes per nation\nis more than enough to scare\nthe shit out of anyone with\ndesigns on them, and only\nan orange shit in a wig could\npossibly misunderstand this.\nNuclear proliferation was a\nterrifying issue of the Cold\nWar, culminating in the\nCuban missile crisis. Let us\nhope that, ultimately, nuclear\nweapons will never be used,\nand those in power remain\nrational in their approach to\ninternational diplomacy.\n\\\\ A few nukes per\nnation is more than\nenough to scare the\nshit out of anyone\nwith designs on\nthem, and only an\norange shit in a\nwig could possibly\nmisunderstand this \\\\\n\n"

Carried out in the\ninterests of National Security,\nthe order prevents citizens\nof seven countries of Muslim\nmajority (Syria, Iran, Sudan,\nLibya, Somalia, Yemen, and\nIraq) from entering the USA\nfor 90 days. In addition, it has\nhalted refugee processing for\n120 days (permanently from\nSyria) and has more than\nhalved the cap from 110,000\nto 50,000 total refugees that\nwill be accepted in 2017.\nIntended to reduce terrorist\nactivity in the US, it has\nwidely been hailed as cruel\nand illogical.\nThe new president is no\nstranger to opposition from\nthe music industry. Both his\ncampaign and neonatal presidency have been dogged\nwith criticisms from media\npersonalities and famous\nmusicians. This began with a\nhost of artists requesting that\nDonald Trump desisted from\nusing their music at his rallies.\nKnown for using classic rock\nat his campaign events, artists\nsuch as The Rolling Stones,\nLGBTQ community for her\nperformance at a pre-inau-guration concert for Trump.\nShe later retweeted a piece\nfrom The Boston Globe,\ndescribing the nominees for\nhis cabinet as a \u201cwho\u2019s who\nof homophobia\u201d.\nTrump still has some friends\nin music, however. Cultural\nicons such as Kanye West,\nKid Rock, and Ted Nugent\nall came out in his support\nduring the campaign. With\nKanye famously saying \u201cIf I\nwould have voted, I would\nhave voted for Trump\u201d.\nTheo Farah\nTwisted Sister, Steven Tyler,\nand R.E.M drafted letters to\nhis campaign office requesting that he no longer play\ntheir music. Aerosmith\u2019s lawyers were keen to negate \u201cthe\nfalse impression that [Steven\nTyler] is connected with or\nendorses Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid\u201d. True to form,\nTrump\u2019s campaign continued\nto use mostly unauthorised\nmusic at their events whilst\nignoring repeated requests to\nstop from copyright holders\nand artists alike.\nThis trend continued through\nto his inauguration, with singers from C\u00e9line Dion to Elton\nJohn refusing to sing. Perhaps\nthis was partly out of fear\nof the backlash from fans,\nas Andrea Bocelli reported\nreceiving after initially accepting the gig. Jennifer Holliday,\na Broadway singer, felt com-Musicians against Trump\nA\nny excuse to\nvisit one of\nmy favourite\nvenues in\nLondon is\nwelcomed\nby me, so much more the\nbetter when that excuse is\nme donating to an amazing\ncharity and getting a great,\nmusic-heavy evening in\nreturn.\nThe Oval Space is small\nand intimate, overlooking\nan industrial side of the city\nwhich adds to the very unique\nvibe that the venue offers.\nAlongside this is a great\nsound system and an outside\narea perfect for tearing away\nfrom the sweaty crowds for\nshort dance-free breaks. The\ncrowd there is always an\nincredible one to be part of,\neven more so this night when\nit felt as if a big community\ncame together over their love\nfor music, all in the good of\ndonating to a great cause.\nThe whole night was run\nfor free as all proceedings\nwent to charity, with the DJs\ncoming in as special guests \u2013\nmost of them only revealed on\nlight-shows, and overpriced\ncans of cider (the beer sold-out within a couple hours).\nEach set flowed on from the\nother flawlessly, sometimes\nwithout me ever even noticing\nthe change-over. This could\nbe due very much to the\nintensity of the music and how\neasily you were absorbed\ninto it, dancing along with\nthe crowd to each track\nbefore realising that hours\nhad passed and you were in\ndesperate need of some fresh\nair.\nThis was a perfect example\nof a charity knowing its crowd\nand appealing to them in a\nway that not only offers them\nan amazing day of music,\nfun and dancing, but raises\nawareness of the illness to the\nage group most affected, and\nletting them help out in a way\nthat they love.\nPhilipp Antonas\n\\\\ The whole night\nwas run for free\nas all proceedings\nwent to charity, with\nthe DJs coming in\nas special guests \u2013\nmost only revealed\non the night \\\\\nthe night.\nThis night was hosted as a\nfundraiser for Mind, a charity\naimed at providing support\nto those suffering from mental\nhealth problems. This involves\nraising awareness, campaigning to improve the services\navailable, and helping promote a better understanding\nof this serious set of illnesses\nthat affect around 25% of\nyoung adults every year.\nThe greatness of their\nfundraiser doesn\u2019t stop there\nthough, as the music blasting\nthrough the venue when\nyou enter the heavy double\ndoors is eager to prove.

As\nthe ban started\nhaving very real\nconsequences\nfor countless\npeople across\nthe globe,\n#MuslimBan\nstarted trending on social\nmedia plat-forms. The very\nnext day, Owen\nJones called for\nan emergency\nnational demonstration in London, which\nwithin two days got the\nattention and potential\nattendance of over 60,000\npeople.\nAt Imperial College,\ninfamous for it\u2019s politically\napathetic student body\nthe turnout was historically one of the largest\nturnouts in recent memory.\nGasim Gasim, an Electrical\nand Electronic Engineering\nfresher and first time protester\nwas impressed. \u201cImperial\nstudents are not political and\nI\u2019ve heard it actually, from\none of our Wardens who\nused to be in LSE. One\nof our main differences she said was\nthat IC students\naren\u2019t political at\nall. So it\u2019s nice\nto see everyone\ncoming out\nright now.\u201d\nThe large\nturnout is\npartially due\nto the efforts\nof Ariana\nSadr-Hashemi,\na second year\nphysicist, managing to coordinate a\nsign making workshop\nand get over a hundred\nstudents to attend the protest\nin unison.\n\u201cAs an international student,\nwhen I heard about the\nmarch, I knew I wanted to go\nand I invited some friends; I\nsent it to someone I knew and\nthey sent it to other people,\nand yeah, it just kind of\ngrew\u201d. It is believed to have\nbeen the highest number of\norganised Imperial students\ndemonstrating in a long time.\nThe protest itself was\nestimated to have been\nattended by over 10,000\nprotesters. As a professional,\nI was surprised. Protesting\ntakes time, energy, planning,\nand commitment. Normally I\nwouldn\u2019t have been able to\nattend due to the workload\nand last minute nature of the\nevent. But I did, not so much\nas a reporter (there was no\nneed, the protest was well\nattended and documented\nfrom members of the press\nincluding felix) but as an\nindividual, adding my voice\nto the thousands shouting in\nunison \u201cRefugees are welcome here\u201d.\nI was even more surprised to\nbump into a number of friends\nand acquaintance from\nuniversity, including the Head\nof the Student Voice. Though\ntheir attendance wasn\u2019t unex-pected, the fact that I kept\nbumping into familiar faces\nwas as, those who have ever\ntaken part in a mass demo\nknow, finding anyone in a\ncrowd is near impossible. And\nwhile the massive cat head\non my shoulders certainly\nmade me more locatable, the\nfact remained: an unusually\nlarge number of Imperial\nstudents had been at\nthe demo.\nMonday came\nand went, people\nin London\nand beyond\nprotested,\nstatements\nwere\nreleased and\n\u2018clarifications\u2019 were\nmade, but\nregardless of\nwhether we\u2019re\nbeing fair or\nnot on Trump\n(though I personally think that his\ndangerous rhetoric\nhas received not only a\nfair, but rather an inadequate reaction) an important\nside-effect of Trump\u2019s polar-ising governance seems to\nhas been the re-ignition (or\nat least reinforcement) of the\npolitical spirit of the British\npublic.\nPolitical apathy is an issue\nthe UK and other European\ncountries have struggled with\nfor decades. The \u2018apathetic\nyouth\u2019 is regularly blamed\nfor the shortcomings of the\ndemocratic process. In the\nUK, there\u2019s been an evident\ndownwards voting-turnout\ntrend since the 1940\u2019s. And\neven though turnout has been\nincreasing since the 2001\ngeneral election which saw\nthe lowest ever participation\n(59.4 percent) in a general\nelection in recent British\nhistory, the UK only now hit\npre-noughties levels of vot-er-turnout this summer during\nthe EU referendum, where\n72.2 percent of the population voted.\nAre recent developments,\nfrom the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum to Donald Trump\u2019s\ninauguration, prodding\n\\\\ There\u2019s concern\nthat the international\nfocus on Trump is\nsteering the public\u2019s\nattention away from\nimportant national\nnews \\\\\n\\\\ As an\ninternational student,\nwhen I heard about\nthe march, I knew I\nwanted to go \\\\\n\\\\ I joined as an\nindividual, adding\nmy voice to the\nthousands shouting\nin unison \u201cRefugees\nare welcome\nhere\u201d \\\\\nus back into a politically\nenergetic state? SadrHashemi thinks it\u2019s the\npolarised political\nclimate. \u201cWhen\nsomeone is so\nfar on one\nside of the\npolitical\nspectrum\nyou do get\nthe uniting\nof everyone who\nis more\nmoderate\nkind of\ngoing \u2018this is\ntoo much for\nme, I\u2019m going\nto protest now\u2019\u201d\nRobin Saunders\nan Imperial alumnus\nagrees. \u201cDuring my time\nat Imperial there was a feeling of political apathy. During\nmy degree we voted in the\ncoalition and I voted Lib Dem\nat the time and had plenty of\nyears to think over my sins for\nthat. But there was a general\nfeeling that democracy was\nfailing us and that it didn\u2019t\nmake a difference \u2013 even if\nyou wanted to support the\nright cause your voice wasn\u2019t\ngoing to be heard. This is a\npowerful sign that this doesn\u2019t\nhave to be true and that\nthere\u2019s still life left in the British people and in Imperial.\u201d\nTo me, this became\nparticularly obvious right\nafter the \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 took\nplace, during the preparation for and participation\nin Monday\u2019s anti-Trump\nprotest outside 10 Downing\nSt. The emergency demo\nwas immediately organised\n\\\\ Are recent\ndevelopments,\nfrom the UK\u2019s\nBrexit referendum\nto Donald Trump\u2019s\ninauguration,\nprodding us back\ninto a politically\nenergetic state? \\\\\nand attended by reportedly\n10,000 people in a time-win-dow of just two days. That\nmight seem small in comparison to the Women\u2019s March\nturnout which took place\nin London the week before\nand which was reportedly\nattended by over 100,000\nprotesters, however this\nwould be an unfair compari-son. For starters, the women\u2019s\nmarch was organised weeks\nin advance giving everyone\ntime to make plans and even\ntravel into London to participate in the demo. We need to\nalso recognise that protesting\ntakes time and energy. Going\nto a protest is not fun, it\u2019s nec-essary. So to see thousands\nof people gather on Downing\nStreet to protest again so\nsoon and so spontaneously\nwas not only extraordinary,\nbut also a clear sign of political involvement.\nAs Saunders says, \u201cMay\nmight not respond to this\nevent but if there are people\nout there who aren\u2019t sure that\nspeaking up does anything\nwe\u2019re here to gather in numbers and show them that it\ncan.\u201d\n\\\\ Lloyd James\n\\\\ Izzat Rais\n\\\\ Lloyd James\n\\\\ Izzat Rais\n\\\\ Lef Apostolakis\n\\\\ Izzat Rais\n\\\\ Izzat Rais\n\n"

It all\nactually may seem pretty\nold-fashioned \u2013 not all\nfemales like to dine on dainty\npretty kale salads dressed\nin hibiscus flowers and not\nall men live for burgers\nand the Union\u2019s curly fries\n(had to throw that one in\nas an old Beit-timer, sorry).\nHowever, research shows\nthese assumptions truly have\nhistorical grounding. In fact,\nthese eating patterns, socially\ninfluenced or not, could help\nexplain why men are at\nhigher risk of heart disease\nand some cancers. Perhaps\nour ideas about masculinity\ndo negatively affect our\nhealth.\nProfessor Luke Zhu at the\nUniversity of Manitoba and\nJoop de Boer, a retired social\npsychologist, detailed that\neating unhealthier food is\npsychologically associated\nwith masculinity, particularly\nenergy-dense and strong\nfoods. Conversely, femininity\nmarkers include eating pasta\nsalad and fruit, or rice and\nvegetables with wine for\ndinner.\nIt\u2019s clear to see the health\nimplications here: Overall,\nwomen, who are more likely\nto be more health-conscious\nanyway, are choosing\nfoods with more fiber and\nantioxidants, while men tend\nto overdo it on saturated fat\nIs meat really manly?\nIpsita Herlekar explains how taste and flavour can be brought back in tomatoes\nH\nave you ever\nwondered why\nthe tomatoes\nin your salad\ntaste as bland as\ncardboard (yes\neven the Taste the Difference\none)? That\u2019s because they\nactually lack the stuff that\nadds taste and flavour, a\nrecent study has discovered.\nFor many decades, tomatoes have been extensively\nand selectively cross-bred\nfor developing new cultivars\nthat producing larger fruit,\nwith uniform red colour,dis-ease resistance and a longer\nshelf-life. In this process, the\nmodern commercial tomato\nvarieties have lost the genes\nresponsible for expression of\nflavour and taste.\nA study by Dr. Harry Klee\nand his team from the University of Florida, has shown that\nlow sugar content and lack of\nsome volatile compounds is\nthe chemical reason behind\ncommercial tomato varieties\nbeing tasteless. In order\nto understand the genetic\nlink, Klee and his team put\ntogether chemical profiles\nof commercial and heirloom\nvarieties, and conducted taste\ntests to rate the intensity of\ntheir flavours, sweetness and\nsourness.\nThe right mix of sugars\nand volatile compounds is\nessential to bring out the\nflavours in a tomato. Sugars\nand acids present in the fruit\ninteract with taste receptors\nwhile volatile compounds\ninteract with olfactory senses,\nand combined together they\ncontribute to the signature\ntomato taste. When compared to heirloom varieties,\nthe commercial varieties had\nsmaller quantities of sugars\nand acids and lacked many\nvolatile compounds. Thirteen\nflavour enhancing volatile\nchemicals were identified by\nthe scientists, many of which\nwere missing in the commercial tomato varieties.\nBesides chemical profil-ing, using gene-mapping\ntechniques, researchers have\nidentified alleles responsible for giving the tomato its\nsweet-tangy flavour. Alleles\nare variants of genes that\nrepresent specific characters like shape, colour, size\nor taste of the tomato fruit.\nThe dominant allele gets\nselected and is expressed.\nAs expected, the commercial\nvarieties were missing the\nright set of alleles needed to\nmake tomatoes tasty.\nNow that the scientists know\n\\\\ Modern tomato\nvarieties have\nlost the genes for\nexpression of taste\nand flavour \\\\\nMaking tomatoes tasty again\nthe chemical recipe required\nto make a tomato taste good,\nthey believe by replacing the\nuntasty alleles with their tasty\ncounterparts, commercial\nvariety of tomatoes can be\nmade flavoursome again.\nHopefully soon, we will be\nable to savour Bloody Marys\nwith a new piquant flavour.\n\\\\ Commercial\nvarieties have\nless sugars and\nlack many volatile\ncompounds \\\\\nAlexandra Lim\n\\\\ Eating\nunhealhier food\nis psychologically\nassociated with\nmasculinity \\\\\nand empty calories. The only\nexception here is that women\nare more likely to have\nthat glorious (but dainty!)\nchocolate pudding with\ncardamom-vanilla ice cream\nspeckled with bits of chocolate sable. Anyway.\nOne particularly interesting\nangle in this research is that\nmen and women who see\nmasculinity and femininity\nas less separate categories\naren\u2019t too different in their\nmeat preferences, while those\nwith traditional gender beliefs\nare more likely to eat more\nmeat if they\u2019re men. Turns\nout it\u2019s all a psychological\nthing, meat having patriarchal notions of power and\nperformance.\n\\\\ Missy\n\\\\ Cyclonebill\n\n"

Honestly.\nAfter eight year\u2019s of Barack\nHUSSEIN OBama\u2019s liberal-shariah law agenda being\nforced down the throats of hard\nworking Wall Street bankers,\nwe finally have the politician\nwe have all been waiting for. A\npolitician who does what\u2019s best\nfor the country as a whole, who\nis unafraid to make the difficult\ndecisions, and who is actually\nhonest. If we had been given\nShilliary as our next female\npresident (well technically she\u2019s a\nspace lizard), then we would have\nhad to endure lie after lie, with\nall her promises being altered by\nbig business, leaving nothing for\nthe common man like you and me.\nLook at Barack HUSSEIN Obama\n\u2013 he promised he would close\nguantanamo bay within his first\nterm so that we would no longer\nbe able to extract information\n(torture) out of brown people, but\nhe never did. The Fuhrer Trump\npromised he would build a wall\nand keep all muslims out and he\nfollowed through! I wouldn\u2019t be\nsurprised if he locks Hillary up\nsooner or later \u2013 maybe a nice\nlittle public execution would heal\nour damaged nation?\nNow I hear your arguments\nabout the fact that most terrorists have been home grown,\nbut why can\u2019t you understand\nthat through blocking the\nHijabs, we will stop them from\nimporting their radicalisation\nchemicals that they hide in\ntheir Halal meat. Admittedly\nhe hasn\u2019t blocked immigration from countries like Saudi\nArabia that have actually been\nproven to fund terrorism, but\nwhat you need to understand\nis that they have a lot of oil\u2026\nand something something\nintelligence services to keep\nus safe. At the end of the day,\nhowever, a muslim is a muslim,\nand if they\u2019re kept imprisoned\nat airports, then the worst they\ncan do is blow up those shops\nthat only sell neck pillows and\noverpriced portable chargers.\nThe next step is to deport all\nthe libtards and homosexuals;\nhowever we just need a way\nto identify known homosexuals \u2013 I think they generally\nwear rainbows, so if we could\nfashion a star of david out\nof rainbow material i\u2019m sure\nthe gays would buy it and\nthat would make life a whole\nlot easier. Whilst we\u2019re at it,\nI think we could ban vegans\nas well. There is something\nperverted about someone who\nwould rather fuck a piece of\nfermented mushroom than eat\nthe delicious flesh of a chicken.\nOf course no great detection\nstrategy is required as all of\nthem will identify themselves as\nsoon as they enter the room.\nT\nhis week in light of\nrecent events, I have\nhad a change of heart\nand have decided that\nthe protocol of building\nwalls is actually a\nconstructive one, and one that I\nhave decided to take to heart. Of\ncourse what I mean by this is that I\nam going to construct an elaborate\nwall around myself so that I don\u2019t\nhave to deal with any of the\nworld\u2019s bullshit anymore. I have\ncontacted artisanal brickmakers\nin the far east (also known as\nshoreditch) and construction begins\nwithin the next few days. I have\nchosen the colour of the bricks\nto be that of the gender-neutral\nshade of yellow, flaxen. This way,\nnot only will it not trigger me by\nconforming to stereotypical gender\ncolours, but it will also make me\nlong for the sweet nourishment\nof flax seed. It will remind me\nof a time before a penchant for\nsexual assault was a presidential\ncharacteristic, and racism was an\nAmerican pastime.\nI shall of course need to bring\ncompany with me for warmth and\nconsummation; however, after\nputting an advertisement on my\nlocal wholefoods bulletin board\nand receiving no interested parties\nI have had to turn my attention\nelsewhere. I have managed to\nacquire a vegan goat and it shall\nbe able to provide for me in many\ncapacities. First of all, as long\nas I keep them (gender neutral\npronouns FTW) sustained on tofu, I\nthink it shall be acceptable for me\nto suck at their teats for food as I\nwill be more like a family member.\nWith that said, however, if things\nare to happen between the two of\nus, then who knows \u2013 inside my\nwalls we can forge new rules and\na new philosophy.

Mad Max: Fury Road shows us\nwhat could happen if Trump continues to get his tiny hands\nall over environmental policy. Already he\u2019s resurrected the\nDakota Access pipeline, gagged the National Parks Service, and removed the climate change page on the White\nHouse website. Mad Max: Fury Road teaches us that the\nway to deal with the incoming environmental crisis is to\npick up a guitar and start shredding.\n\\\\Warner Brothers By Fred Fyles\npicks movies for the Trump-era\nA Separation (2011)\nThe rise of Trump has been blamed by some on the existence of the \u2018echo chamber\u2019, where people only surround\nthemselves with those they agree with. If this is true, it\u2019s\nnot only a problem of the left: those on the right need\nto get in touch with those they might not see eye-to-eye\nwith. Trump\u2019s recent \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 bars citizens from seven\nMuslim-majority countries from entering the USA. Among\nthese countries is Iran, so Trump could do with exploring this country\u2019s cinema, starting with Asghar Farhadi\u2019s\nmasterful A Separation. Dealing with the divorce of a mid-dle-class couple, A Separation shows us that \u2013 surprise!\n\u2013 Iranians are no different to the rest of us.\n\\\\ Artificial Eye\nResist through cinema! | felix\u2019s film section\nNetwork (1976)\nWhen trying to find films that predicted Trump, it is better\nto eschew tragedy in favour of farce, and things don\u2019t get\nmuch more farcical than in Sidney Lumet\u2019s Network, which\neerily seems to have foreseen the rise of modern TV. Peter\nFinch plays Howard Beale, the long-standing anchor of\nthe UBS Evening News. As a result of declining ratings, he\nis going to be fired, but when he has a breakdown on-air,\nthreatening suicide, his ratings soar. Soon, Beale is regularly sounding off, and as he becomes more deranged the\nviewers only increase.

With a well-armed electorate, this film\ncould show Trump what he has to worry about...\n\\\\ Wikimedia\nGhost in the\nShell\nI\nf you wish to dive into\nthe world of Japanese\nanimation, you cannot\nmiss Mamoru Oshii\u2019s\nprofound 1995\ncyberpunk film Ghost\nin the Shell. It stands as a\nscience-fiction classic and\nhas gone on to inspire other\nfilms such as The Matrix,\nSurrogates, and Avatar. But\nwhy am I talking now about\na film released more than\ntwo decades ago? Well,\nthis March we are to see a\nlive-action remake of the film,\nwith Scarlett Johansson as\nthe lead character. Ahead\nof its release, this week\nsaw cinemas showing the\nanimated original, so I took\nthe opportunity to finally see\nthis classic on the big screen.\nOshii\u2019s Ghost in the Shell\nis based on Masamune\nShirow\u2019s manga series of the\nsame title: set in Japan in the\nmid-21st\ncentury, it follows\nthe undertakings of the coun-ter-cyberterrorist organisation\n\u2018Section 9\u2019, led by Major\nMotoko Kusanagi. In this\nworld, computer technology\nhas advanced so far that the\ndistinction between man and\nmachine is ultimately blurred\n\u2013 people in this society are\nincreasingly cyberised, with\nmany possessing \u2018cyberbrains\u2019 that allow them to\ninterface with the various\ninformation networks around\nthe city. Kusanagi is, herself,\na cyborg, whose only human\npart is her brain.\nThe increasing cyberisation\nof society has thrown up a\ndisturbing problem: there now\nexist computer hackers skilled\nenough to hack into people\u2019s\nbrains. This can enable a\nhacker to control another\u2019s\nactions, and even implant\nfalse memories and experi-ences. The film\u2019s plot revolves\naround the pursuit of such a\nhacker, dubbed \u2018The Puppet\nMaster\u2019, in an investigation\nled by Section 9 and Major\nKusanagi\u2019s team. The hunt\ninvolves an intricate sequence\nof political intrigue, but ultimately leads to a far-reaching\nexploration of self-identity\nand man\u2019s place in nature.\nShirow claims that the\nname \u2018Ghost in the Shell\u2019 is\na homage to author Arthur\nKoestler\u2019s philosophical work\nThe Ghost in the Machine,\nfrom which he drew inspira-tion. And Koestler\u2019s title is\nitself taken from the phrase\n\u201cghost in the machine\u201d, which\nwas ultimately coined by the\nphilosopher Gilbert Ryle as\nPeter Shatwell\na disparaging description of\nmind-body dualism. I realise\nI may have alienated a few\nreaders by now, but my point\nis that Ghost in the Shell is,\nphilosophically, very rich,\nexploring \u2013 among many\nother things \u2013 the mind-body\n(or ghost-shell) problem.\nWhere exactly is the mind?\nIs it the mind that makes us\nhuman, and not machine?\nCan that be the case if the\nmind can be copied and\nplaced into a different cybernetic body? I like thinking\nabout this stuff, and such\nquestions abound whilst\nwatching Ghost in the Shell.\nBut even if you don\u2019t particularly enjoy thinking about\nthis stuff, luckily the visuals\nare gorgeous, and there\u2019s still\na plot to follow. Who is this\nmysterious hacker? Are they\neven a person? Will they be\ncaught? Don\u2019t you want to\nfind out? Well, you\u2019d better\ngo watch the film. From its\nhaunting musical score, to\nits spellbinding visuals of the\nnear-future, as well as the\nprofound existential questions\nit raises, Ghost in the Shell\nreally is a treat to watch. And\nhey, it\u2019s even on Netflix \u2013\nwhat have you got to lose?\nAn existential vision of the future \\\\ Production I.G.\nI\nn a political climate\nincreasingly described\nwith the neologism\n\u2018post-factual\u2019, director\nMick Jackson\u2019s latest film\nDenial is sharply relevant.\nCentering around the libel\ncase of British Holocaustdenier David Irving against\nAmerican historian Deborah\nLipstadt \u2013 a case that was\noften referred to as \u2018history\non trial\u2019 \u2013 Denial make a\nconvincing case for the\nimportance of historical truth,\nand the dangers of wilfully\nmisinterpreting facts.\nThe film opens several years\nbefore the trial, with Irving\n(Timothy Spall) upsetting a\nQ&A held by Lipstadt (Rachel\nWeisz) in promotion of her\nbook Denying the Holocaust. In the book, Lipstadt\naccused Irving of deliberately distorting historical\nevidence to claim that Hitler\ndid not murder millions of\nJews and, subsequently,\nthat the Holocaust was a lie.\nThis initial scene sets up the\ntemplates the characters will\nfollow: Irving is irascible and\nattention-seeking, goading\nhis opponents to fall prey\nto his rhetorical traps, and\nglorifying in the subsequent\nuproar; Lipstadt is full of\nburning anger at those who\ntry to belie the human costs\nof the Holocaust, but her\nfiery temperament means she\ncomes off worse-for-wear in\nthe initial confrontation.\nWe then skip forward a\ncouple of years, and Irving is\nserving libel papers against\nLipstadt for her claims. He\nmakes the tactical decision\nto make the claim in the UK,\nwhere the burden of proof\nis on the defendant, forcing\nLipstadt to travel to London\nand try and argue against\nIrving\u2019s claims. She is assisted\nby top-flying solicitor Anthony\nJulius (Andrew Scott) and represented by barrister Richard\nRampton (Tom Wilkinson),\nwho decide that the best\ncourse of action is for Lipstadt\nto stay quiet, depriving Irving\nof the oxygen of publicity.\nThe result, is a script from\nplaywright David Hare that\nrelies too heavily on a onenote culture clash between\nAmerican and British cultures.\nWeisz\u2019s Lipstadt is the typical\nAmerican: all action, she\ngets frustrated with her\nmore subdued colleagues;\nThe Brits, in contrast, are all\nsoftly-spoken, slightly slippery\nand oily (seemingly Andrew\nScott\u2019s favoured role), with Fred Fyles\nWeisz works through a dodgy script \\\\ Laurie Sparham/\nBleecker Street\na penchant for tradition and\nclaret. As with his theatre\nwork, Hare\u2019s scriptwriting has\na terminal lack of nuance,\nwhich at points spills into\ncrass emotional exploitation\n(Auschwitz is a site which\ndeserves more solemnity than\na saccharine Howard Shore\nscore can offer).\nThat being said, Denial\nremains undeniably enter-taining, and manages to\nsuccessfully explore the\nintricacies of the British legal\nsystem \u2013 which, as Lipstadt\nmentions, is somewhere\nbetween Dickensian and\nKafkaesque \u2013 without being\nbogged down in the minutiae\nof complex details. Weisz\ngives Lipstadt a fierce dignity,\nmaking her an extremely\nlikeable heroine, while Spall\nabsolutely excels as Irving:\nhe falls naturally into the\nrole of gross villain, coming\nacross like a serpent feasting\non a particularly plump rat.\nDespite its tendency to err on\nthe side of simplicity, Denial\nremains a solid courtroom\ndrama, one that surveys our\nlabyrinthine legal structure\nwhilst remaining highly\nengaging.\nDenial\n\n"

However,\nit is likely this will not be a\npriority for Brexit negotiators,\nas their departments are\nalready overwhelmed and\nunderstaffed.\nIn a completely different\ndirection, leaving Euratom\nwould also slow down\nconsiderably the Hinkley\nPoint C nuclear power plant\nproject, as well as make the\noperation of all current plants\nmore difficult. According to\nthe Guardian \u201cEuratom also\nprovides safety inspections\nfor all civilian nuclear facilities\nin the UK, including Hinkley\nPoint B, Sizewell and Torness\nin Scotland. It is the legal\nowner of all nuclear material,\nand is the legal purchaser,\ncertifier and guarantor of\nany nuclear materials and\ntechnologies that the UK\npurchases. This includes our\nnuclear trade with the United\nStates.\u201d Taking back control\napparently includes taking\nresponsibility for nuclear\nwaste. Surely having won the\nmost toxic campaign in recent\nhistory and insisting that the\ncountry \u2018moves on\u2019 makes the\nBrexiters experts in the subject\nof toxic waste disposal.\nI\nn a slightly surprising\nmove, the UK government\nannounced last Friday\nthat Brexit meant leaving\nEuratom. This comes after\nTheresa May said Britain\nwould: \u201cwelcome agreement\nto continue to collaborate with\nour European partners on\nmajor science, research, and\ntechnology initiatives\u201d in her\nLancaster House speech last\nmonth.\nIn an explicatory note\nattached to the Article 50\nbill, currently being debated\nin parliament, the Minister\nfor Brexit David Davis\nannounced that \u201cleaving\nthe EU\u201d included Euratom,\nwhich shares the institutions\nof the EU, but has a distinct\nlegal existence. Euratom is a\nEuropean organization aimed\nat fostering fundamental and\napplied research in the domain\nof nuclear energy. Its flagship\nprojects are currently ITER,\nan international experimental\ntokamak currently under\nconstruction in Southern\nFrance, and JET. JET, the Joint\nEuropean Torus, is particularly\nimportant for the UK, as it is\nbased in Culham, Oxfordshire.\nIt is the centrepiece of Britain\u2019s\nCulham Centre For Fusion\nEnergy(CCFE),andiscurrently\nthe world\u2019s largest tokamak by\ninner volume. JET was recently\nupgraded to include the same\nmaterials that will ultimately\nbe incorporated in ITER, to\nserve as a test bench. Around\n350 scientists from Europe\nparticipate in experiments at\nJET each year. None of them\nor anyone in the staff at the\nCentre for Fusion Energy was\nwarned in advance by the\ngovernment, which suggests\nthe decision to leave Euratom\nwas a last-minute addendum to\nthe Brexit bill. This impression\nwas further reinforced when\nMPs from Oxfordshire also\ncomplained they had not been\ngiven advance notice.\nJET is currently funded by\nthe European Commission\n(which administrates Euratom\nas well as the EU) to the tune\nof 283 \u20ac million for the 2014-2018 period, or very slightly\nless than half of Euratom\u2019s\nbudget for the period. This is\nan area of EU spending where\nthe UK receives substantially\nmore than it gives. The indirect\nimpact is even greater: JET is a\nsignificant selling point for the\nCCFE and Oxford University,\nwho have developed a whole\narray of skills related to the\ntokamak, developing them\ninto worldwide leaders of\nfusion research. Among the\nfeatures pioneered by/unique\nto JET are the concept of the\ndiverter \u2013a designated area\nwhere the plasma escapes the\nmagnetic confinement field\u2013\nand the fact that it is the only\ntokamak equipped to handle\ntritium. These two innovations\nof JET have had visible\ninfluences on the whole centre:\nseveral members of staff are\nnow specialized in diverter\ndesign and performance, and\nCCFE boasts the world\u2019s most\nefficient tritium repurposing\nfacility. These would be in\njeopardy if the UK failed\nto reach an understanding\nregarding JET\u2019s funding after\n2018.\nThe UK could seek associate\nmembership of Euratom (a\nstatus currently enjoyed by\nSwitzerland), which would\nalleviate some of the mediumKing\u2019s lecturer sparks racism row\nRacist pseudoscientific tweets cause KCLSU complaint\nLef Apostolakis\nshared hundreds if not thousands of times.

Following the results,\nthe Union discussed a possible\nchange with Imperial\u2019s Quality\nAssurance and Enhancement\nCommittee (QAEC). At the\nfirst discussion the QAEC was\nskeptical of any sort of change,\naccording to the report.\nFollowing that initial\ndiscussion, two surveys were\nconducted regarding the late\nsubmission policy. The first\none conflicted with views of\nreduction, the decision to grant\na failing grade after falling\nbelow the passing quota\nwas negotiated in a meeting\nbetween the QAEC and\ncollege members. The parties\nagreed that an unlimited\nreduction system would allow\nstudents to \u201cgame\u201d the system\nand provide less incentive\nto submit work on time. They\nalso believed that students\nwith mitigating circumstances\nbranching from serious\nproblems, such as poor health\nor family issues, would keep\ntheirissuestothemselvesrather\nthan reach out to teaching staff\nfor support, because of the\ndiminished sense of urgency\nan unlimited reduction system\nwould create.\nAccording to his report,\nMcCrone played an\ninstrumental part in working\nwith QAEC to get the new\npolicy approved, \u201cI was\npersonally present at the\nmeeting and made best efforts\nto stand by what students\nwanted,\u201d he said.\nOn McCrone\u2019s blog it read\nthat he believed, \u201cCollege\nrightfully acknowledged that\nthis was a population of the\nstudent body which we could\nnot ignore.\u201d He concludes that\n\u201cthis is a momentous win for\nthe Union and for students.\u201d\nsome of the Senior Academic\nRepresentatives.

    "content": "Friday 3 February 2017 17\ncultfeli@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/culture\nfelix\nC U L T U R E\nT\nhe television,\nwith its ability to\nrepeatedly display\nthe images of those\nwho have long since\ndeparted, can act\nas an electronic graveyard,\nconjuring up spirits from the\npast. It is fitting, therefore,\nthat Christine \u2013 the latest film\nby Antonio Campos, which\ndeals with the on-air suicide\nof news reporter Christine\nChubbuck \u2013 opens with an\nimage of a TV screen, on\nwhich flickers a ghostly, pale\nshe\u2019s still a virgin, rapidly\napproaching 30 \u2013 and\nspends her spare time performing existentialist-tinged\npuppet shows for sick children\nat the hospital (sample\ndialogue: \u201cwhat if you know\nsomeone, but you don\u2019t\nreally know them?\u201d). All her\nenergies are devoted into her\nwork, which involves seeking\nout stories involving \u2018real\nFloridians, but the opportunity for a promotion to a TV\nstation in Baltimore pushes\nChubbuck into overdrive, as\nshe seeks ever-more bizarre\nmethods of getting viewers.\nWe see her, hunched over film\nreels, jarringly lit from under-neath, wincing in pain at\nstomach cramps that will later\nturn out to an ovarian cyst; an\noperation to remove it would\nseverely reduce her chances\nof conceiving, unless she gets\npregnant in the next couple of\nmonths. To what extent Chubbuck\u2019s suicide is down to her\nmental health problems, and\nwhat part is played by her\nless-than-ideal situation, is a\ntaut skein of a question, which\nthreads its way through Craig\nSilowich\u2019s delicate script.\nBut while others in the story\nhave their own problems \u2013\n\u2018gorgeous\u2019 George, the head\nanchor, has had drinking\nproblems; Chubbuck\u2019s mother\nPam self-medicates with marijuana \u2013 Chubbuck makes the\nmistake of seeking solace in\nher work. Chubbuck\u2019s interest\nis in \u2018issue-orientated\u2019 and\n\u2018character-based\u2019 reporting;\nin other words, the stories\nparade of emotions, with\ndespair, sardonic humour,\nand barely-repressed rage\nbeing communicated in a\nsingle scene. Chubbuck\u2019s dialogue is often minimal, usually\npointed, sarcastic retorts, but\nHall manages to get across\na wealth of information in\na simple turn of a head,\nor movement of the eyes.\nMichael C. Hall is similarly\nexcellent as the former-jock\nGeorge, whose well-meaning\nattempts to help Chubbuck\nseem to backfire.\nThere are numerous\nmoments in the film where\nChubbuck seems to be on\nthe verge of admitting others\ninto her life, only for the\ndoor to swing swiftly shut.\nChubbuck\u2019s flat affect and\ndark, straight hair is at odds\nwith the sunny Florida of\nthe 1970s, a contrast that is\nheightened by Joe Anderson\u2019s\ncinematography, which revels\nin jarring colours. The TV\nmonitors cast a pale light on\nChubbuck\u2019s face, emphasising her angularity, while in\nother scenes she is bathed in\na ghostly green glow, giving\nher a sickly air.\nChubbuck is marked by an\never-present anxiety about\nwhether what she\u2019s doing will\nget her ahead in her career;\nher eyes never quite seem to\nfocus on other characters,\nonly snapping to them when\nwork or promotions are men-tioned. Early on in Christine,\nshe asks Jean whether she\nseems too sympathetic when\nshe interviews people; \u2018how\ncan you be too sympathetic?\u2019\nshe replies. Answers about\nhuman behaviour which\nseem obvious to others can\nbe a mystery to Chubbuck,\nsomething that is heightened\nby her day-to-day role as a\n\u2018human interest\u2019 journalist.\nIn one heart-breaking scene,\nshe interrupts a couple having\nan anniversary dinner: \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t help but notice you\nback there,\u201d she says, looking\namused, \u201cyou both seem to\nbe very much in love\u201d. At\nmoments like this, Chubbuck\nis desperately trying to understand how the world seems\nto work; she is no longer a\nnews reporter, but the world\u2019s\nloneliest anthropologist \u2013 she\nis trapped behind a screen,\non the outside looking in.\nFred Fyles\nRebecca Hall astonishes in this biopic\nof Christine Chubbuck, a Florida\nnews reporter who killed herself live\non air, which powerfully explores\nthe events leading to her death in\nan anxiety-ridden tour de force\nof \u2018real people\u2019. This pits her\ndirectly against station chief\nMichael (Tracy Letts), whose\nmaxim \u2018if it bleeds, it leads\u2019 is\nreminiscent of Sidney Lumet\u2019s\nmasterful 1976 black comedy\nNetwork. Like in Christine,\nNetwork ends with the death\nof a news-reporter, but while\nin Network the responsibility\nlies directly at the feet of the\nstudio, in Christine things are\nmore complex: it is clear that\nChubbuck is at odds with\nboth the emerging interest\nin exploitative TV, and the\nmacho culture she encounters\nat the office, but this is far\nfrom the only factor contributing to her demise.\nChubbuck is a tragic figure\nin the most classical sense of\nthe word: we know that she\nkills herself, the methods of\nher suicide, and that this will\ninevitably happen before the\nfilm\u2019s two-hour runtime is over.\n\\\\ Allstar/Great Point Media\nChristine\n| On the\noutside\nlooking in\nChubbuck, in the middle of\ninterviewing Richard Nixon.\nThis on-screen image is\ndivorced from reality, giving\nus the unsettling feeling\nthat we\u2019re looking back\ninto the past. We soon find\nout that Chubbuck is not\nin fact interviewing Nixon,\nbut rather trying to analyse\nhow she comes across to\nthe camera, planning on\nevaluating every lilt in her\nspeech and movement of\nher head; it is a scene that\nimmediately communicates\nher indomitable work ethic,\nher capacity for self-criticism,\nand her dreams for a larger\nmarket-share, all of which\nplay a part in her descent\ninto depression. This scene\nis revisited later in the\nfilm, becoming an anchor\nto the departed reporter,\nas Chubbuck\u2019s one-sided\ndialogue becomes more\npointed: \u2018is it paranoia,\u2019 this\nspectral Chubbuck asks, \u2018if\nindeed everyone is coming\nafter you?\u2019\nIs everyone coming\nafter Christine? Fleeing a\nbreakdown-inducing Boston,\nChubbuck is forced to live\nwith her mother in Florida,\nworking as a local reporter\nfor a dead-end station. She\nhas no boyfriend \u2013 indeed,\nThe unavoidable nature of\nthis ending makes Christine\na near-unbearable watch,\ncomparable to having a\npanic attack in slow motion; a\nsinking feeling of impending doom grips the viewer\nfrom the opening sequence,\nand continues long after the\ncredits have rolled. Small\nacts, from both Chubbuck and\nothers, begin to take on a\ndeep significance, as the audience interrogates their effects\non the protagonist.\nThis hypervigilance is\nencouraged by Hall\u2019s perfor-mance, which can only be\ndescribed as masterful; the\nfact that she has not received\nany major awards this season\nis a travesty. Hall imbues\nChubbuck with a fierce\nphysicality, contorting her\nbody into spasms of anxiety.\nHer face registers an endless\n\\\\ Hall\u2019s\nperformance can\nonly be described\nas masterful; the\nfact that she has not\nreceived any major\nawards this season\nis a travesty \\\\\n\n"

Since many games\nhave a setting baked into\nthem, your choice of genre\nwill have an impact on what\ngame you end up playing,\nand the same with whether\nyou want a mechanically\nthe first one. D&D is a fantasy\ngame where each player is a\nfantasy trope such as a Dwarven Cleric, or an Elf Ranger.\nThough it can be quite a complex game at times, it does a\ndecent job at easing you into\nit, only reaching stupid levels\nwhen you\u2019ve already played\na bit and have a grasp of\nthe basics. D&D\u2019s big draw,\nhowever, is its name. It is\nmuch more present in media\nthan any other RPG, and that\nmeans that it probably has a\nhigher chance of convincing\nyour potentially hesitant\nfriends to jump in and have\na go.\nMy other suggestion is Fate\nAccelerated Edition, a streamlined and rules-light system\nthat focuses much more on\nthe narrative you construct\nand who your characters\nare rather than whether you\nhave a +1 or a +3 in athletics.\nWith its easy-to-teach and\neasy-to-learn rules system,\nFAE is perfect for people new\nto RPGs. It is entirely genre\nindependent, so it can be\nused to play a Guardians of\nthe Galaxy style romp as well\nas for defeating dark wizards\nat the hands of teenagers.\nNo matter what you want\nto play, there\u2019s going to be\nan RPG for it. You can forget\nyour looming deadlines by\nslipping into the messy lives\nof teenage monsters or by\nbeing female pilots during\nWW2. In fact, RPGs are my\nfavourite way to shirk off\nmy responsibilities, slipping\ninto the worlds where I have\nachieved so much. And given\nthe current state of the world,\nwho doesn\u2019t need that from\ntime to time?\n8-bit snacking\nheavy or light game. Because\nthis can be a daunting\ndecision, and for the sake of\nbrevity, I\u2019m going to suggest\ntwo of my favourites.\nMy first suggestion is\nDungeons and Dragons 5th\nEdition, the big daddy of\ntabletop RPGs and arguably\n\\\\ They take place\nin the minds of your\nfriends and yours \\\\\n\\\\ Benjamin Esham\nT\nhere are a million\nreasons as to why\nfood appears in\nvideo games which\nis to say there is\nonly really one\nreason: everybody eats. It\nmight seem obvious but it\u2019s\nthe truth and when you think\nabout it, food plays a much\nlarger role in video games\nthan what you think.\nTake Pac-man for instance,\nwhere the sole purpose of\nthe game is to get Pac-man to\neat yellow fluorescent blobs.\nThere are of course other\nmore descript food items, like\ncherries and strawberries,\nwhich when eaten, allow\nyou to in turn eat the ghosts\nwho are trying to eat you.\nA simple enough dynamic\nbut one which ultimately\nrevolves around food.\nIt\u2019s not just Pac-man or all\nthese culinary games which\nare about becoming the best\nchef; most games in general\nhave some link or relation\nto food. Just look at Super\nMario where mushrooms\npower you up, or an RPG like\nDragon Age: Origins, where\nnumerous subplots are based\naround getting food, like\nhelping some thirsty soldiers\nor stockpiling cabbages.\nconsumption is probably one\nof the most widespread ways\nof representing progression\nor health regeneration. Food\nis usually a source of comfort,\nbut in games, it\u2019s a resource,\nessential to keep going.\nEven though the nature of\nfood in video games is a bit\nmonotonous, a lot of cultural\ninfluences can be recognised\nin games of recent years.\nFor example, in the game\nGTA San Andreas, whenever you eat more fast food,\nyour avatar starts to put on\nthe calories and you need\nto work out at the gym to\nget your weight in check. In\nanother example, The Legend\nof Zelda: Wind Waker features \u2018grandma\u2019s Elixir soup\u2019\nwhich is the strongest health\npotion in the game, not unlike\nthe real-life chicken soup\ncounterpart.\nBecause food is such a\nbig part of our lives, some\ngames are going out of their\nway to use food, in order to\nmake gaming a much more\nimmersive experience. Food\nfeels good; it\u2019s comforting\nand it helps add a layer of\nrealism and tangibility to\nvirtual space. Some survival\ngames are based around\nscavenging for the right types\nof food to make it through the\nday. In fact, some players feel\nsuch an emotional connection\nto their food in games that\nthey replicate a lot of in-game\nfood items and recipes. Just\nrun a quick search on google\nto see how to make things\nlike Pok\u00e9mon Pok\u00e9puffs and\nPortal cake.\nJust like in real life, food in\ngames is about much more\nthan just pure sustenance as\neach item can be enveloped\nin many layers of cultural and\nemotional baggage. Though\nmany of the items we come\nacross may be little more than\nhealth potions at times, they\u2019re\nundeniably a crucial element\nof the games we love.\n\\\\ Food plays a\nmuch larger role in\nvideo games than\nwhat you think \\\\\nPower-Up! \\\\ Andrew Ell\nSaad Ahmed\nFood is something everyone\nwants and needs and it\u2019s\n\n"

Although\nit is now the most frequently\nstaged opera worldwide, La\nTraviata\u2019s beginnings were\nplagued by stern censorship\nand moral outrage. That a\ncommon prostitute should\nbe portrayed in anything\nother than a negative light \u2013\nworse, for her to be the star\nof the show \u2013 was a shocking\nstatement to make in the\nVictorian era.\nThis was all the more so\nbecause prostitution was very\nmuch rampant in 19th\ncentury\nParis. In 1847, just a few\nyears before, the renowned\ncourtesan Marie Duplessis\nhad died of consumption.\nDespite her profession, her\ndelicate and refined nature\nwas praised by her many\nlovers, among whom were\nFranz Lizst and the writer\nAlexandre Dumas fils. After\nDuplessis\u2019 death, Dumas\nwrote a semi-autobiograph-ical play based on her life,\nLa Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\n(Duplessis wore red and white\ncamellias to signify her sexual\navailability). It was this play\nthat inspired Verdi to write La\nTraviata.\nThe presence of courtesans\nwas winked at by Parisian\nsociety, but only as long as\nthey knew their place \u2013 these\n\u2018fallen women\u2019 could never\nbe elevated above the status\nof their sin. Personally, Verdi\nalso ran afoul of these inflexible societal rules: society\nstrongly disapproved of his\ndecade-long cohabitation\nwith the singer Giuseppe\nStrepponi.\nWith his tragic heroine Violetta, Verdi brought society\u2019s\nhypocrisy uncomfortably\ninto the public eye. Small\nwonder that the opera-house\nLa Fenice insisted that La\nTraviata be disguised safely\nin the costume of the previous\ncentury. For thirty years, La\nTraviata was set anachronis-tically in the 1700s. But the\naudience could probably\ntell that it was a \"subject for\n[their] times\u201d \u2013 modernity, in\nthe form of the fashionable\nwaltz and polka rhythms, pervades the score of the opera.\nWaltz rhythms are heard\nthroughout Act I, as Violetta\nthrows a grand party for\na crowd of friends and\nadmirers. The young Alfredo\nGermont declares his love;\nVioletta refuses him initially,\nbut gives him a camellia and\ntells him to return when it is\nfaded. In Act II, their happy\nlife together is dashed by\nthe appearance of Alfredo\u2019s\nfather. The older Germont\nregretfully asks Violetta\nto leave Alfredo because\nher reputation is hindering\nthe respectable marriage\nof Alfredo\u2019s sister. Though\ntorn, Violetta sacrifices her\nhappiness and writes in a\nletter to Alfredo that she is\nabandoning him. The two\nlater meet at a party where\nAlfredo publicly denounces\nand humiliates Violetta, who\nfaints from the shock. In the\nthird act, Violetta\u2019s consumption has caught up to her and\nshe is dying. Alfredo, having\nbeen told of Violetta\u2019s fidelity\nand sacrifice, rushes to make\namends, but it is too late, and\nshe dies in his arms.\nRichard Eyre\u2019s production of\nLa Traviata is located in the\nmid-19th\ncentury, exactly as\nVerdi envisioned. As is appropriate for a great classic, the\ninterpretation is literal rather\nthan avant-garde. This is the\nproduction\u2019s 14th\nrevival at\nthe ROH since its premiere\ntwo decades ago in 1994 \u2013\na testament to its enduring\npopularity \u2013 and yet it is far\nfrom old-fashioned or boring.\nThis is one of the most beautiful sets I have seen in any\nproduction, conjuring realistic\natmospheres of grandeur or\nbleakness without tipping\nover into excess (I\u2019m looking\nat you, Manon Lescaut).\nFor an opera, the story of\nLa Traviata feels surprisingly\nauthentic, perhaps because it\nis inspired by real life rather\nthan legend. No gypsies\nbeing burnt at stakes here,\nno revenge carried over\nfrom generations before, no\nsupernatural curses dogging\nthe protagonists as in Il Trovatore or The Flying Dutchman.\nVerdi\u2019s sensitive rendering of his characters has\nLa Traviata |\nAn opera that\nspeaks to the\nheart\nClaire Chan\nJoyce El-Khoury as Violetta Val\u00e9ry in La Traviata\n\\\\ Tristram Kenton\ncreated a Violetta who is both\nstartlingly human and heart-breakingly vulnerable, and\ntherefore I think the success of\na run of La Traviata hinges on\nthe soprano playing her. Not\nonly must she navigate the\nchallenging arias and their\nfiendish coloratura demands,\nshe must also successfully\nembody the youthful beauty\nwasting away from consump-tion. Violetta is marked by\ndeath, and she knows it; this\nknowledge fuels her \u201cliving\nfor pleasure\u201d in Act I and\nheightens the tragedy of her\nparting from Alfredo in Act II,\nwhich is to be final.\nThe first ever Violetta, the\nplump and middle-aged\nSalvini-Donatelli, was so\nunconvincing that the audience burst into laughter at\nher imminent death in Act III.\nVerdi himself recognised the\nunique need for a believable\nactress, writing that the singer\nshould have \u201can elegant\nfigure, be young and sing\npassionately\u2026 Even a mediocrity could possess the right\nqualities to shine in that opera\nand be dreadful in everything\nelse.\u201d\nFortunately, Joyce El-Khoury\nwas marvellously believable.\nShe held my attention from\nAct I; her rich and mature\nvoice was well controlled, her\ntrills and flourishes perfectly\nin tune with the orchestra. Her\ntrue strength, though, was\nin bringing across Violetta\u2019s\ndepth of character. In the\nfamous \u201cSempre Libera\u201d\n(Free and aimless), El-Khoury\nsang with the wild gaiety\nof Violetta\u2019s commitment to\npleasure, but also conveyed\nthe confusion of her slowly\nfalling for Alfredo. I was\ncompletely sucked into her\nheroic self-sacrifice in Act\nII\u2019s \u201cDite alla giovine\u2026\u201d(Tell\nyour daughter\u2026) against the\nunyielding demands of Germont the elder (sung by Artur\nRuci\u0144ski\u2019s splendid hoary bar-itone). Sergey Romanovsky\nwas occasionally a bit rigid as\nAlfredo but his mellow tenor\ncomplemented El-Khoury\nexcellently in the duets.\nAlthough I am not one who\nsheds tears easily, even I had\na lump in my throat during\nEl-Khoury\u2019s \u201cAddio, del\npassato\u201d \u2013 Violetta bidding\npoetry in La Traviata and its\ntale of anguish, of self-sac-rifice. The ROH\u2019s classic\nproduction and outstanding cast brings it out to the\nhighest degree. Verdi would\nhave approved.\nLa Traviata will return to\nthe Royal Opera House in\nJune 2017. Tickets from \u00a311.\nfarewell to the dreams of\nthe past as she lies dying in\nan empty room, forsaken\nby all who loved her. No\nwonder La Traviata is one of\nthe greatest operatic tragedies of all time.\n\u201cPoetry of the brothel,\u201d\nwas the dismissive remark\nof another irate 19th-century\nreviewer. But there is indeed\nWish List |\nA harrowing\nportrait of\nzero-hours\ncontracts\nI\nf someone were to\nwander into the snug\nstage-room on the\ntop floor of the Royal\nCourt Theatre on Friday\nevening, if they were\nlucky enough to enter at the\nright moment, they might\nchance upon what appears\nto be an impromptu, karaoke\nrendition of Meat Loaf\u2019s\nI Would Do Anything For\nLove. A bemusing sight,\nbut just a fleeting fantasy\nin the harsh reality of a girl\ncalled Tamsin, who tried to\nsupport both herself and her\nyounger brother through her\ntaxing, zero-hours contract.\nStruggling to make ends\nmeet, she has taken on a\njob at a packing warehouse,\nwhose almost-Orwellian\nmotto \u2018Work. Enjoy. Improve.\u2019\nreeks of irony, leading to it\nbeing mockingly dubbed the\n\u2018fulfilment centre\u2019 by Luke \u2013\nTamsin\u2019s co-worker.\nThis is the world of Katherine Soper\u2019s Wish List: a\nplay, beautifully directed by\nMatthew Xia, which draws\nyou into a world where life is\ndifficult, and bureaucratic red\ntape seems to cordon off the\nescapes in every direction.\nTamsin\u2019s 16-year-old\nyounger brother Dean\ndepends on her due to\nhis obsessive-compulsive\nbehaviour, which has rendered him incapable of going\nto college or even leaving the\nhouse alone in the daytime.\nBut this is not how the government seems to view it, and\nDean\u2019s benefits are cut after\nhe is deemed fit to seek work.\nEverything about this play\nis lonely: the cast consists of\njust four different characters,\nand the play is set in a quiet\nroom with a capacity perhaps\nmore commonly associated\nwith classrooms than theatres.\nThere is no question about\nhow accurately this reflects\nTamsin\u2019s reality, which seems\nto be isolated in every way \u2013\nshe is cut off by her brother,\nby her dire situation, and by\nthe governmental bureau-cracy, which fails to see the\nname behind the numbers.\nAnd yet, in a strange way,\nWish List seems to shine. The\ndistance we feel makes us\nappreciate the fleeting flashes\nof hope and happiness we\nwitness throughout, making\nthem all the more flavourful,\nsuch as the moment when\nTamsin receives a tea-light\nfrom Luke, which stands\nout all the more. The play\nsomehow manages to capture\nthe grim irony of Tamsin\u2019s\nsituation in a very cute way,\nwith a surprising number\nof laugh out loud moments,\nmany stemming from the\nlight-hearted and likeable\ncharacter of Luke, performed\nperfectly by Shaquille AliYebuah; it\u2019s a kind of humour\nthat is hilarious in the terrible\nyet beautiful way it captures\nTamsin\u2019s awful situation.\nIn such an intimate setting\n\u2013 where the audience are\nas much a part of the stage\nas the actors \u2013 the challenge facing the cast is much\ngreater than acting in front of\na larger audience. As Tamsin,\nErin Doherty puts forward a\nvery strong and emotional\nperformance, making Tamsin\u2019s struggles evident through\ndevastatingly nuanced words\nand expressions. Dean\u2019s\ncharacter is illustrated in\na terrifyingly real way: his\nfragile mental state, despite\nat first seeming very in-your-face, swiftly and seamlessly\nbecomes an intrinsic part of\nthe character, and I credit this\nto Joseph Quinn\u2019s unflinching\nportrayal. Aleksandar Mikic\nalso shines in his role as the\nLead \u2013 Tamsin\u2019s ostensibly\nstiff supervisor whose true\ncharacter gradually comes\ninto the light, revealing him as\na family man who has simply\nfallen prey to pressures from\nthose above him.\nS\nhappi Khorsandi\nhas lived in\nEngland for 40\nyears, and in Oh\nMy Country!: from\nMorris Dancing\nto Morrissey she explains her\nBilly Bragg-inspired brand\nof patriotism: \u201cit\u2019s about\nplaces, not races\u201d, she says,\ndelivering anecdotes about\nskinheads in the 80s and\nracial abuse nowadays with a\nsense of nostalgia. Khorsandi\nis adamant about her identity\nbeing defined on her own\nterms, and refuses to be put\nin a box. She explains her\naversion to her book, Nina is\nNot Okay, being nominated\nfor an award dedicated to\n\"Writers of Colour\" \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not\na crayon!\u201d she says, showing\nthe audience an open letter\nshe received in response to\nasking herself to be removed\nfrom the long list. Having\nbeen accused of \u201cobscuring\nher identity\u201d, she points at her\nface, and her book cover, on\nwhich her name is printed.\nShe\u2019s never had to justify her\nIranian heritage, she says.\nHer young children perfectly exemplify her dual\nculture: she paints a picture\nof her sarcastic son watching\nCountryfile, snacking on\npotted beef, while her dramatic three-year-old daughter\ncalls it \u201cdog food\u201d and goes\nback to eating her sheep\u2019s\nhead. She brings out her\npassport onstage, telling the\naudience about a conversation with a twelve-year-old\nrefugee in Calais who was\nso impressed she had a red\none. She reads the front,\nand describes it as a \u201csick\nnote from the Queen\u201d. She\nrolls her eyes at Trump, and\nreflects on the absurdity of\nthe idea of her satirist father,\nforced to flee death threats in\nIran 40 years ago, not being\nallowed to travel to the US.\nHaving delivered a speech at\nthe rally the night before, she\ncomplains about having to\ncome up with new material on\nsuch short notice.\nAll her material is delivered\nwith charm and authentic-ity.

On the day of\nthe talk the attendees were\ngiven the location as well\nas a set of instructions: Two\nforms of ID would be needed,\nno bags inside the venue,\nno mobiles to be used in the\nvenue, and no social media\nIsraeli ambassador\u2019s secret visit to Imperial\nfelix reports from the mystery talk\nMatt Johnston\nboth the lack of an opposing\nviewpoint as well as the\nsecrecy surrounding the\nevent. \u201cIt is quite worrying\nthat the College did not think\nto invite an opposing view to\nhelp balance the conversation\nthemselves. This would\u2019ve lead\nto a much more open-minded\nand fruitful discussion with\ndifferent perspective being\nexpressed...Further still, the\nfact that the event was not\npublicised properly... is, in\nitself, disheartening.\u201d They\nadded, \u201csuch questionable\nmethods raises certain moral\nandethicalconcerns;thiscould\nvery well lead to the belittling\nof our university\u2019s free thinking\nand challengeable identity, a\nfrankly horrific and disturbing\nnotion.\u201d\nWhen contacted by felix,\nImperial\u2019s Israeli Society\nexplained how they had\nno part in the facilitation of\nthe event as they were \u201ca\nnon religious and apolitical\nsociety\u2026 We like to make an\nemphasis on the fact that we\nare the Israeli society and not\ntheIsraelsociety.Werepresent\na people, the Israelis and not\nthe Israeli Government.\u201d\nAn Imperial College\nspokesperson said \u201cImperial\nstrives to provide opportunities\nfor its community to hear\na wide range of views,\nand space for debate and\ndiscussion, in accordance\nwith the College\u2019s Freedom\nof Speech policy. The security\narrangements made by the\nCollege for a high profile\nspeaker like this obviously\ntook account of advice from\nthe Metropolitan Police, and\nthere were no security issues\nduring the event.\u201d On the topic\nof holding similar events in the\nfuture they added \u201cwe shall\ncontinue to provide support\nfor a broad spectrum of\nspeakers to visit the College.\u201d\nDr Matthew Wraith, a\npolitics lecturer at Imperial,\nchaired the talk and\nintroduced Ambassador\nRegev who started with\na 15 minute introductory\nspeech. In these opening\nremarks Regev outlined what\nhe thought were the two\nessential pillars needed for\npeace agreement to happen,\n\u201cMutual recognition\u201d and\n\u201csecurity\u201d. On the first point\nthe Ambassador stressed that\nrecognition of the legitimacy of\nthe other sides claim was key\nand put forward a thesis that\nthe reason for conflict is not\nthat Palestinians don\u2019t have a\nstate, instead that \u201cthe reason\nthere is a conflict is because\nthe Jews have a state\u201d.\nAmbassador Regev then cited\nthe various partition plans\nbrought forward that were\naccepted by the Israelis but\nrejected by the Palestinians.\nRegev went on to question\nthe meaning of peace without\nthis mutual recognition, saying\nthat to Hamas it was a peace\nthat would enable them to use\na partial Palestinian state as a\nvehicle to destroy the rest of\nIsrael.\nDr Wraith later accused this\ncriticism of the Palestinian side\nas hypocritical, referencing\nIsrael\u2019s acceptance of the\n1937 Peel Partition which was\nbased on the same principle\n(David Ben-Gurion, first Prime\nMinister of Israel, said at the\ntime \u201c[I am] not satisfied with\npart of the country, but on the\nbasis of the assumption that\nafter we build up a strong force\nfollowing the establishment of\nthe state, we will abolish the\npartition of the country and\nwe will expand to the whole\nLand of Palestine.\u201d)\nOn the aspect of security\nAmbassador Regev insisted\nthat \u201cIf you can\u2019t defend the\npeace then the peace won\u2019t\nlast\u201d, especially in the unstable\nclimate currently present in the\nMiddle East.\nThe Ambassador then went\non to say that the Israelis\nare willing to return to the\nnegotiating table with no\npreconditions, allowing the\ntwo sides to \u201cgive and take\u201d\ntowards a peace treaty. The\nfact that the Palestinians had\nnot returned to the negotiating\ntable recently was because\nthey \u201cprefer to go to the UN,\nthey prefer to UNESCO,\nthey prefer to get resolutions\nin multilateral fora voting\nagainst Israel\u201d. This then led\nonto a point in which Regev\nfelt that Israel was unfairly\ndiscriminated against by\nthese bodies and because the\nPalestinians have an automatic\nmajority, \u201ceveryone agrees\nat the UN it\u2019s always Israel\u2019s\nfault\u201d.\nIn the questions section the\ntopics of settlements, Kurdish\nindependence, Israeli nuclear\nweapons, a one state solution,\nand Donald Trump were\nbrought up amongst other\nthings. A video of the full event\nis due to be released at some\npoint in the future.\nTo understand how this event\ncame to be, we approached\nDr Wraith. He explained that\nit was the Israeli Embassy\nwho had first approached him\nfor the Ambassador to visit\nImperial and not the other way\naround. \u201c[The ambassador]\nsaid \u2018I want to come and\nspeak to Imperial\u2019 and I said\n\u2018Do you want to speak to my\nclass or make it a more public\nevent?\u2019 He said \u2018either\u2019 and\nI said \u2018both\u2019\u201d. The talk at Dr\nWraith\u2019s class happened a few\nmonths ago and was attended\nby about 30 students.\nThe ambassador likely\nvisited Imperial as part\nof Israel\u2019s wider anti-BDS\n(Boycott, Divestment and\nSanctions) strategy, especially\nconsidering Israel\u2019s high tech\neconomy in conjunction to\nImperial\u2019s STEM expertise.\nUniversities up and down the\ncountry have implemented\nboycotts of varying degrees,\nwith three Imperial academics\nsigning an open letter last\nyear which pushed for an\n\u2018academic boycott\u2019 of Israeli\nuniversities.\nWraith, who had a large\nhand in the initial logistics of\nthe event, also spoke about\nhow the security precautions\nramped up around the event\nas the police were scared of\na repeat of the scenes seen at\nKing\u2019s College and UCL last\nyear in which protesters on\nboth sides clashed at events\nwith pro-Israel speakers.

I had a bit of a shaving foam adventure.\nI emptied several cans over myself and masturbated in the shower. My first experience, with\nsomeone else involved, came a few years later. I\nmet someone online and we poured jelly and baked\nbeans all over each other in the bath.\nWhere do you think it stems from psychologically?\nFrom quite an early age I tended to enjoy gunge themed\nor messy game-shows a fair bit more than my friends and got\na bit of an odd feeling watching them, so it seemed to pop up\nfairly early on in my development. I guess making a mess is a bit\nof a taboo and a lot of fetishes are based around some kind of\nrule-breaking. It\u2019s certainly an unconventional kind of experience\nwhich, for me, makes it quite exciting. It can also be involved in\nsub/dom or humiliation dynamics which definitely draws me to it.\nHave you ever had a bad experience with it?\nOh god yes. About two years ago, I was between apartments\nand so was staying with a friend in his London flat for a while.\nI was super horny while he was still at work so, knowing that he\nwas into it too and wouldn\u2019t mind, I decided I was going to have\nI heard you like... food?\nWe get down and dirty to get you the messy details in \u2018Wet and Messy\u2019\na solo session in the bath. I went out to buy some milk, eggs,\ncustard and corn-flour. I mixed a big bowl of corn-flour and\nwater, made up the custard and sat in the tub with everything\nI\u2019d acquired placed by the side. I had a great time, but by the\ntime I finished, the bath had a three inch layer of mess in it. I\nhad planned to clean up before my host arrived back from\nwork, so I pulled the plug, stood up, and went for the\nshower tap. No water came out.\nA bit puzzled, I climbed out of the bath and started to\nwonder how I was going to get cleaned up. I grabbed\nan old looking towel and started to wipe the sludge\noff my body. That\u2019s when I noticed something coming\nout from beneath the bath side-panel. Unfortunately my\nhost hadn\u2019t told me that the bath wasn\u2019t yet plumbed in.\nI took off the side panel to see that the mess had spread\nall over the untiled floor beneath. He got home about two\nhours later as I was making a feeble attempt to clean it up.\nHe didn\u2019t actually seem that pissed off and after a few hours\nwe managed to get the bulk of it cleaned up, but I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ve ever been so ashamed in my life. I avoided talking to him for\nabout a year after that.\nGod, that sounds pretty awful. So, do you have any advice or\nsuggested messy substances for people who might want to try\nWAM?\nAllow for a lot of clean up time. It always takes longer than\nyou think. Doing it in a paddling pool or a plumbed in bath is\nusually a good idea. As for substances, Corn-flour and water\nis great fun. It\u2019s a personal preference thing though. If you\nlike gunge and slime, you can try Natrosol or Slube which are\nmade for gunge play. Just make sure you check for allergies\nbefore you get in a tub of it!\nH\nave you ever found yourself aroused by the thought of having a cream pie pushed into your face or cracking eggs over someone\u2019s chest? Of course you have.\nWell, you\u2019re not alone. This fringe phenomenon is called \u2018Wet and Messy Fetishism\u2019, often abbreviated to WAM or simply called sploshing. Fans of WAM\nenjoy the sensation of wet or messy substances being rubbed or poured on their bodies. These can include cream, custard, eggs, milk, beer and non-food\nsubstances such as paint, gunge, oil, mud or lotion. People involved in WAM often like to stress that bodily fluids are not included in the list.\nI caught up with a guy who\u2019s been into WAM for some time to ask him some questions. (He has asked not to be named so we\u2019ll give him the pseudonym\nHamish.)\nThat concluded my interview with Hamish. I was left wondering how many minds shows like \u2018Get your Own Back\u2019 and \u2018Dick and Dom\u2019 had affected early on in sexual\ndevelopment, or whether these urges were more nature than nurture. Either way, rolling around in a paddling pool filled with gunge does sound like a laugh. Maybe I\u2019ll\ngive it a go.\nB.C. Maile\nDRUGS\nDRUGS\nThatmomentyou\u2019rerushingonsugar\nT\nhe dictionary\ndefinition of a\ndrug is either \u201cA\nmedicine or other\nsubstance which\nhas a physiological\neffect when ingested or\notherwise introduced to\nthe body\u201d or \u201cA substance\ntaken for its narcotic or\nstimulant effects\u201d. Each of\nthese definitions are perfectly\nvalid, and classify drugs as\nhaving either a medicinal\nor recreational purpose.\nThis is all well and good,\nbut what happens when the\nlines are blurred? Ingesting\ncaffeine results in stimulation,\nleading many to take coffee\nfrequently as their opium,\nyet society views only one of\nthese addictions to be harmful\n(bet you can\u2019t guess which\none).\nOur brains are hardwired\nto perform certain essential\nbodily functions such as\neating, drinking and taking\ncocaine. When we perform\none of these vital actions, a\nhormone called dopamine\nis released into the brain.\nDopamine is interpreted as\npleasure, therefore almost\nprogramming our brains to\nrepeat the action in order get\nanother hit. Cocaine does\nthis by releasing enormous\namounts of dopamine,\nthus explaining its addictive nature. A substance\nwhich releases very\nlarge quantities of\ndopamine is known\nas a \u2018superstimulus\u2019.\nBut what if other\nlegal substances\nproduced the\nsame effect? For\nexample, excessive amounts of\nsugar and high-ly-processed junk\nfoods can have the\nexact same result,\nalso functioning\nas superstimuli. If\ncocaine and sugar both\ncreate addiction in the\nsame manner then perhaps\nbe more accepting of your\ncokehead flatmate when they\ntell you about your developing sugar addiction.\nFoods have the presumption\nof safety. We are all aware\nthat if you eat too much you\nget fat, and die. You can also\neat too little, lose weight, and\ndie. But beyond these minor\ntropes, in general, if you eat\nan apple a day you won\u2019t get\nAIDS (that is to say eating\nan apple a day won\u2019t give\nyou AIDS. Eating an apple a\nday will also not protect you\nfrom AIDS or keep the doctor\naway. Especially if the doctor\nis a sexual health adviser.\nStay safe kids).\nHowever under the\ncurrent classifi-cation, alcohol\nis treated as\na food and\nnot a drug.\nAlcohol\nimparts\nlarge\namounts of\ncalories so\nperhaps\nunderstandably it\nis treated as\na food, however I\u2019ve never\nheard of anyone\ndrinking alcohol\nfor its\nnutritional\nadvantages\nS U G A R\nwhen not rolling around in\ntheir own faeces at a summer\nfestival. With such a dangerous substance being classified\nas a food, it is eminently\navailable and therefore thoroughly abusable.\nIn general there is a wisdom\nto separating drugs from\nfood. Food is supposed to act\nas fuel to attend all those lectures you don\u2019t go to. Drugs\nare meant to have medicinal\nand therapeutic effects that\nyou\u2019re too busy experiencing\nso you don\u2019t bother going to\nlectures. Substances that act\nas both food and drugs blur\nthat line, leading to a steadily\nmore convoluted classification\nsystem. With this in mind take\nnote of what you\u2019re ingesting.\nJust because it\u2019s a food\ndoesn\u2019t make it inherently\nsafe and just because it\u2019s a\ndrug doesn\u2019t make it inherently fun. If sugar produces\nsimilar effects on the brain\nto cocaine and you\u2019re not a\nfan of steady addiction then\nyou\u2019d better stop ordering\nthat organic chocolate\nbrownie iced vanilla dou-ble-shot caramel cream\nextra hot Frappuccino\nfrom Starbucks every\nmorning eh?\n\\\\ I met\nsomeone online\nand we poured jelly\nand baked beans all\nover each other in the\nbath \\\\\nDo you LOVE drugs?\nDo you HATE drugs?\nEither way, we want to know.\nGet in touch.\nmillennials.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

As a British national, I was equally\noutraged by our government\u2019s complicity with it. For\na Prime Minister who claims to lead a country that\nprides itself on upholding the values of \u201cindividual\nliberty\u201d and \u201cmutual respect for and tolerance of\nthose with different faiths and beliefs\u201d, May\u2019s silence is truly an\ninsult to the millions of Britons who live by these values every day.\nMoreover, her condonation of Trump\u2019s racism and Islamophobia is\na gesture of utter disregard for the three million Muslims living in\nthe UK. For the Muslims who work hard, every single day, to make\nBritain what it is. Our so-called prime minister is telling them that\nshe does not give a single damn.\nMay, who has imposed an \u201cintegration oath\u201d since taking\noffice to ensure that all immigrants, many of whom are Muslim,\nNora Abdoun (ISoc publicity officer) condemns Theresa May but finds hope in the British people\n\\\\ You've\nonly got to\nbe human\nto realise\noppression\nis wrong.\nTo stand\nup against\ninjustice \\\\\nThoughts on the #MuslimBan protests\nD\nuring Donald Trump\u2019s\ncampaign, we were often\ntold that his misogynistic,\nfascist and bigoted\ncomments were simply empty\nwords, that he was simply\nmonopolising a popular vote and when\nin office, diplomacy would come. A week\nin, Trump signed a flurry of executive\norders, authorising the construction of\na wall, allowing federal agencies to\nstop Obamacare, giving border agents\nmore freedom to detain immigrants and\nbanning nationals from seven countries\nfrom entering \u2013 even if they held a green\ncard.\nTo ignore the parallels between today\nand the 1930s is to trivialise the years\nof persecution faced by the Jewish community and other minorities. Throughout\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign, he reiterated again and again how he would put\nin place a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 and spoke about\na Muslim registry. Apologists can call it\nby any name, but the sentiment behind\nit is clear. The Holocaust is a blot on our\ncollective global history and it serves as a\nreminder that human beings are capable\nof such overwhelming horrors, and that\nsome of the fault is borne by those who\nstand by and do nothing.\nToday, we see the repercussions around\nthe world of the dangerous alt-right\nA\ns an American\nMuslim I had to go to\nthe march because\nTrump's policy could\nhave prevented my\nvery existence: my\nparents immigrated to the US from\nthe Middle East. It was humbling to\nsee so many people at the protest\n\u2013 especially the number of IC\nstudents, as we're generally known\nfor being politically apathetic.\nTrump's policies do not reflect\nthe America that I grew up in.\nMy sister and I were two of three\nMuslims at my school. Instead of\ncasting us aside they embraced us\nMazen El-Turk (ISoc VP student affairs) believes we must remain\nunited to avoid repeating the horrors of the past\nZayd Alhaddad recalls the America he knows and loves and urges\nthat we fight for what we believe in\nrhetoric of division and \u2018other\u2019-ness.\nFrom the Quebec shooting to the\nIslamophobic attacks being witnessed in some of London\u2019s biggest\nuniversities, Trump\u2019s \u2018Muslim ban\u2019\ncontinues to promise a marginal-ised community even more hate\nand distrust. At a time when extremist ideologies thrive on division, we\nneed to stand together stronger\nin the face of hatred and division\nand stand up against the fascist\nban. We have a duty today to let\nthe Trump administration know in\nno uncertain terms that fascism\nunder the guise of security will not\nbe tolerated by us. Together, we\nstand stronger against all forms of\nextremism, and in the face of open\nhostility, we need to remain human,\ntolerant, and welcoming.\nwith open arms. During Ramadan fasting the school let us play Monopoly with\nthe teachers during our breaks instead of\ninsisting we go and run outside. They let\nmy mum come in and decorate the school\nto celebrate the month, and they put up\nthe decorations every year even after we\nleft. They even insisted we took Eid off\nso we could spend the holiday with our\nfamily. After the 9/11 tragedies and the\nrise of Islamophobia the school invited\nmy mother to come and speak to the\nstudents about what Islam truly means.\nWe were never left to feel like outsiders,\nand it wasn't like everybody there was\nan immigrant; about 80% of the school\nwas white. This is the America that I grew\nup to love and always will. The America\nthat the Founding Fathers stood up for\n(with what they wrote on the constitution\nat least), the America that was created\nas a safe haven for all peoples to seek\nrefuge from religious persecution, which\nis exactly what the new policy embodies:\nit is a flagrant constitutional violation as it\ntargets a specific religious group.\nIt is a shame that the POTUS is who he\nis, but if we keep making our voices heard\nthen hopefully we can stop the hatred\nbefore too much damage has been done.\nadopt \u201cBritish values\u201d, is not only going against these very values herself,\nbut acting to further marginalise a community that she insists should integrate more. The situation would be laughable if it weren\u2019t so destructive.\nHowever, it would be unfair to overlook the abundance of good that has come\nfrom this situation. The past week has seen the British people come out in their\nthousands, at short notice, to stand up against this ban. People of all religions\nand beliefs, ethnicities and backgrounds stood side by side in solidarity with\ntheir Muslim brothers and sisters in humanity. This week, the British public let\nthe Muslim community know, that we are an integral part of society. And what\na beautiful moment that was.\nSo yes, as a Muslim I was outraged by Trump\u2019s #MuslimBan and May\u2019s lack\nof concern about it. However, the past few days have proven that you don\u2019t\nhave to be Muslim to be outraged. You\u2019ve only got to be human to realise that\noppression is wrong. To stand up against injustice.\nAnd whilst we can sometimes feel engulfed by the darkness brought about\nby those in power, we will always have hope in the light we, the people, bring\nto one another. For as Einstein once said, \u201cdarkness is in reality the absence\nof light\u201d.\nYou're\nputting me\noff my food\nTessa Davey explains why 'normal'\neating habits are a privilege not\nafforded to fat people\nI\nhave a complicated\nrelationship with food.\nI think every fat person\ndoes. That isn\u2019t to say I\ndon\u2019t also think that every\nwoman or man who is\nimpacted by the pressure of\nbeauty standards also does \u2013\nI do \u2013 but for a fat person it is\nsubtly different. Being fat is the\nreason that we are perceived\nas greedy, lazy, stupid. Fat is\nthe reason that we are told\nthat we are not attractive, not\ndesirable, not good enough.\nAnd food is predominantly the\nthing that causes that. Food\nis something that we need to\nconsume, several times a day,\nbut it is also something that is\nheavilyassociatedwithshame.\nThe way that society\ninteracts with me, a fat\nperson moving through the\nworld, greatly affects my\nrelationship with food. If\nI, never having interacted\n\\\\ Every interaction with\nfood is carefully calculated to\nbe invisible, to minimise the\nchances that someone might\nnotice and pass judgement \\\\\nwith a foodstuff in public,\nhad a totally healthy and\nnormal relationship with\nfood (to banish the rhetoric\nthat all fat people are fat\nbecause they\u2019re greedy\nand only eat fried food with\ncheese), my eating would\nbecome disordered the\nsecond I stepped out the\ndoor, simply through the\nway that people respond\nto me. As a fat person, this\nforced disordered eating\nis something that you have\nto tackle and struggle with\nevery day of your life.\nAs a fat person, there are\nrules that you must follow.\nYou must never be seen to\nbe enjoying food (\u201cOh, well\nI can see why she\u2019s fat, she\nloves her food, that one\u201d).\nYou must never eat anything\nunhealthy (\u201cAre you sure\nyou need to be eating that?\nNo wonder you\u2019re fat\u201d), but\nalso never anything healthy\n(\u201cA salad, great choice! Are\nyou trying to lose weight?\u201d).\nYou must never eat in transit\n(\u201cYou\u2019re so disgusting, can\u2019t\nyou wait until you get home\nlike everyone else?\u201d) or mention hunger (\u201cI bet you\u2019re\nhungry. Can\u2019t you go a few\nhours without eating?\u201d),\nbut you must also eat when\nothers do (\u201cIf I\u2019m hungry\nyou definitely must be! Are\nyou trying to lose weight?\u201d).\nThese are rules that all fat\npeople know implicitly, rules\nthat would never occur to\nsomeone thin, rules which\nare contradictory and that\nyou cannot obey no matter\nhow hard you try. There\nare further rules regarding\nthe way you must dress and\nexercise in public, but those\nare a story for a different\ntime.\nThese rules are self-im-posed, you might say.\nNo one is forcing you to\nfollow these rules, but your\nself-hatred and deep lack of\nself-esteem. But this isn\u2019t true.\nThese rules are enforced\nby people on the street, by\nfriends, by family. They\u2019re\nenforced by vicious glances,\nby snide comments, by jokes\nand by concern. They mean\nthat every interaction with\nfood is carefully calculated\nto be invisible, to minimise\nthe chances that someone\nmight notice you eating and\npass judgement. To not care\nand eat what you want is to\nmake a political statement\nthat requires huge energy\nto maintain. It is not weak to\ncare, to suffer and to over-complicate your life because\nyou can\u2019t take a joke from\nyour friends or brush off\na comment from a drunk\nstranger in McDonald\u2019s at\n4am on a Sunday. These\ninteractions create a strong\nnegative association with\n\\\\ These are rules\nthat all fat people\nknow implicitly, rules\nthat would never\noccur to someone\nthin, rules which\nare contradictory\nand that you cannot\nobey no matter how\nhard you try \\\\\nfood, invoking feelings of\npanic and discomfort much\nlike those that society is\nhugely sympathetic towards\nin \u2018real\u2019 eating disorder\nsufferers.\nThere is a rise in the diagnosis of illnesses such as\nbinge-eating disorder and\nfood addiction which give\nsome credence to the difficult\nand out-of-control nature of\neating for some overweight\npeople. But these disorders\ndon\u2019t fit the majority of us.\nThere is no diagnosis to tout\nfor people who would have\na 'normal' relationship with\nfood were it not for their\neating habits being called\ninto question constantly.\nI love food. That is, I love\ngood food. I love the aesthetic and textures and\nflavour combinations that\ncome with (what I think is)\ngood food; I care less for\nthe bland beige varieties,\nalthough that isn\u2019t to del-egitimise enjoying them if\nyou do. I love that food can\nprovide comfort through\nassociated memories and\nnostalgia, and I love that\nit is something that brings\npeople together. Seeking out\nnew cuisines, tasting new fla-vours, and cooking are some\nof my primary hobbies, but\nI am always on edge doing\nthem, ready to deflect comments or defend myself. The\nenjoyment I can take from\nfood is always moderated\nby involuntary considerations of whether I deserve\nto eat it or what people\naround me will think if I do.\nThis isn\u2019t to minimise the\nstruggle that I know that\nso many of my thin or aver-agely sized friends face\nwhenever they make a decision regarding food; I know\nthat because of the pressure\nto remain thin in order to be\nsuccessful, most, if not all\nwomen and men will often\ngrapple with the choice\nbetween that \u2018clean\u2019 probi-otic falafel salad (shout out\nto the stand at the Farmer\u2019s\nMarket \u2013 I think that the pro-biotic benefits of the pickles\nare probably cancelled out\nwhen I eat it with Diet Coke,\nbut it\u2019s still delicious) and\nthat \u2018dirty\u2019 burger. But their\nstruggle is purely internal.\nTo be able to eat in front\nof someone without them\nmaking assumptions about\nyour lifestyle, and more\nsubtly and insidiously, your\nintelligence, is a privilege,\nand it is one that you do not\nhave if you are fat: what we\ndo on a daily basis to survive\nis shameful. I am absolutely\na foodie, but unfortunately,\nI am usually one behind\nclosed doors.\n\\\\ To be able to eat\nin front of someone\nwithout them making\nassumptions about\nyour lifestyle is a\nprivilege \\\\\n\n"

Through the haziness they try to recall the ups, the downs and the lessons learned.\nI\nthought the only way I\ncould dull my anxiety\nwas starving it. If I was\ndizzy and needed to\nconcentrate hard on\nstaying upright, there\nwas no space left to worry.\nBefore long I\u2019d reach a\ncomfortable haze, unable to\ncarry a thought for more than\na few seconds. The emptiness\ninside my stomach made\nthe tightness in my chest\nless noticeable. Neglecting\nmy ever growing to-do list\ndidn\u2019t seem so bad if I got a\nkick every time I managed\nto avoid a meal. Avoiding\nany sort of consumption\nbecame my crutch. Not\nonly had I convinced myself\nthat restricting my intake of\nfood would put my physical\nsymptoms at bay, but I started\nbelieving that I was a much\nbetter version of myself when\nI hadn\u2019t eaten. I\u2019m still not\nsure of what was happening\nat the time, whether I was\nactually having fewer panic\nattacks on an empty stomach\nor if I was so desperate\nfor something to take them\naway that I convinced myself\nit was working. I became\nobsessed with constructing\na fa\u00e7ade where it seemed\neverything was okay. I\u2019d smile\nand agree to meet for lunch,\nwhile playing my favourite\ngame of making it seem like\nI\u2019d nearly finished my meal,\nhaving hidden most of it or\nrearranged it in the plate. I\nspent more and more hours\nwithout food, thriving off\nof the sense of control and\nindependence. Soon this\nbehaviour became second\nnature.\nWhen I did eat, it tended to\nbe fast food. I wasn\u2019t avoiding any particular classes of\nfood, or counting calories like\nI\u2019d done in my first encounter\nwith anorexia eight years\nprior. I knew my habits weren\u2019t normal, but I convinced\nmyself it was okay, definitely\nnot an illness or something\nI couldn\u2019t manage. Sure, I\ndidn\u2019t eat as regularly as the\naverage person, but I was\nstill eating sometimes, and\ndon\u2019t all adults get too busy\nto eat occasionally? Rapidly,\nI started to feel like I wasn\u2019t in\ncontrol anymore \u2013 the feeling\nof accomplishment I got from\nignoring meals became more\nand more difficult to attain.\nI was conflicted, unable to\ndecide whether I wanted to\nchange and get help or if\nlosing the sense of achievement that came with avoiding\nmeals was too much to bear. I\nbegan to lash out at everyone\naround me. At the time I\nfelt too ashamed to put my\nactions into words. Nobody\nhad seemed to notice what I\nwas doing so it felt impossible\nto tell anyone what was hap-pening. Saying there was a\nproblem out loud also meant\nacknowledging there was one\nfor sure. I had to abandon\nthe rhetoric of a \u2018spectrum of\nnormal\u2019 I\u2019d managed to fool\nmyself into thinking.\nFinally, I managed the\ncourage to get help. Even\nin the initial stages of\nassessment and therapy, I\nwasn\u2019t entirely sure there was\nanything wrong with me. I\u2019d\nhad a more \u2018textbook\u2019 eating\ndisorder in the past, where\nthoughts of calories and dress\nsize dominated everything\nI did. It was only when a\ndietician told me (rather\ndramatically) that I would\neventually starve to death if\nI continued along the same\ntrajectory that it became\nimpossible to be blas\u00e9 about\nthe situation. Eating more\nregularly was difficult to start\nwith, but after a couple of\nmonths I started to get my\nstrength back. It was hard to\nface that a lot of my struggles\nhad been linked to my weight\nand appearance \u2013 topics\nI hadn\u2019t allowed myself to\nconsciously think about in\nnearly a decade. When I\nbecame aware of gaining\nweight steadily, of physically\ngetting bigger, of the fact\nthat there was more of me in\nthe world, I nearly lost all the\nprogress I made and reverted\nto my habits. Gaining weight\nbecame a proxy for committing to my surroundings and\nresponsibilities \u2013 was I ready\nfor that? It was only then that\nI started to understand my\nrelationship with food was\nvery much about self worth.\nI doubted whether I was\nworthy of eating, worthy of\nconsuming things and occupying space. Managing to\ncontrol something measurable\nwas an easy way to feel like\nI\u2019d achieved something and\nwas therefore deserving of\nmy existence.\nNow I recognise how\nunkind it was to put this much\npressure on myself. I felt like I\n\\\\ The emptiness\ninside my stomach\nmade the tightness\nin my chest less\nnoticeable \\\\\n\\\\ It was only\nwhen a dietician\ntold me (rather\ndramatically) that\nI would eventually\nstarve to death if\nI continued along\nthe same trajectory\nthat it became\nimpossible to be\nblas\u00e9 about the\nsituation \\\\\nwas letting people down; not\nachieving enough academically or not being a good\nenough friend. If you are\nstruggling or feeling inade-quate, remind yourself that\nyou owe nothing to nobody.\nYour priority should be\nyourself and everything else\nis secondary. Like everything\nelse in life, it\u2019s easier said\nthan done.\nSO...... yeah...\nYou\u2019ll starve to death\nif you continue\nalong the same\ntrajectory.\nSoz.\nOmg... I\u2019m so full\nI can\u2019t believe I\nalmost cleared that\nmassive plate of\nmeatball pasta\n\n"

It\u2019s been in a rut lately,\njust doing my tutorial sheets,\ncoursework, revising, cooking\nmy meals, feeling homesick\nover Chinese New Year, dealing with crippling insecurity\netc. I needed to do something\nto pump some excitement\ninto my boring life. After\nall, you\u2019re only young once.\nIf you want to win in life,\nlearn from a winner; spe-cifically, a man who went\nfrom laughing stock to the\n45th\nPresident of the United\nStates. Inspired by the Donald and the right-wing conservative segment of American society, I set about\nmaking my life great again.\nI started the next morning\nwith the most epic break-fast. I ate all the bacon I\ncould carry, toast made\nfrom white bread (the whit-\\\\ Tomorrow is a new\nadventure. A great\nadventure. The best.\nEveryone says so \\\\\nest bread, so white, no more\nliberal hippie sourdough\nrye bread) in a special\ntoaster to imprint an image\nof eagles on it and huge\nmugs of sweet black kaw-fee. Not coffee. Kaw-fee. I\nate my breakfast with a gun.\nDon\u2019t ask me how I did it, I\njust did. I then worshipped\nan image of Vladimir Putin.\nI went to lectures feeling\nSO great. It was awesome,\nterrific, the BEST. My lecturer talked about climate\nchange and global warm-ing. I bellowed that climate\nchange is a Chinese hoax.\nHe snapped that almost all\nscientists agree that it was\nreal. I said that it wasn\u2019t.\nMy fridge was cold. Also,\nChina. China China China\nChina China. He said I was\nmental. I said it was an alternative fact. Suck it. Patriot 1,\nliberal snowflake scientist 0.\nAnother lecturer told me\nthat I hadn\u2019t submitted the\ncoursework due last week. I\nsaid I had. He said I didn\u2019t.\nI said that it was an alternative fact. He said he\u2019d\nfail me. I said that I would\ngraduate with the BEST\ngrades, so good, so good,\npeople will say that no one\nelse is so good.\nI went to Honest Burgers\nfor lunch. I had a YUUUGGEEE burger, massive pile of\nFreedom Fries and a vanilla\nmilkshake. It was so great. It\nwas the greatest lunch in the\nhistory of greatness. Everyone said so, everyone. It\u2019s\namazing. It\u2019s true. I skipped\nmy afternoon lecture to\nlaunch my campaign to\nmake Imperial great again.\nIt\u2019s gonna be YUUUUGGEEE! I said that I would\nbuild a wall around UCL.\nWhen they send over people\nthey\u2019re not sending their\nbest. They\u2019re bringing art,\nthey\u2019re bringing humanities,\nthey\u2019re not real engineers,\nand some, I assume, are\ngood people. I would build\na great, great wall and\nmake them pay for it. I\u2019m\nthe best at building walls,\nit\u2019s gonna be beautiful. I saw\na woman with a disability. I\nmocked her and laughed at\nher until she cried. People\nscreamed at me, calling me\na horrible person. I said\nthat I\u2019m a winner and I can\ndo whatever I want. I told\nthem to join me. Together,\nwe would win so much\nwe\u2019d be tired of winning.\nThey walked away, unable\nto accept so much victory.\nFor dinner I made a T-bone\nsteak so well-done the\nsmoke forced the entire\nbuilding to be evacuated. I\nate it, the taste of charcoal\nin my mouth as the sign of\n\\\\ I ate my breakfast\nwith a gun. Don't ask\nme how I did it, I just\ndid \\\\\n\\\\ You may ask\nhow I can afford to\nlive like this. I took\nout a small loan of\n\u00a310,000 from my\nparents. They're\ngonna be livid when\nthey find out \\\\\nsuccess. I washed it down\nwith a big bottle of California wine. You may ask me,\nhow can I afford to eat like\nthis? I took out a small loan\nof \u00a310,000 from my parents.\nThey\u2019re gonna be livid when\nthey find out.\nI then realised that to complete my quest to make my\nlife great again, I needed a\nwoman. Shockingly, I don\u2019t\nhave a girlfriend. I went to\nthe club and saw a bunch\nof 7s, some 6s, some 5s and\nthere in the centre was a 9.\nShe was amazing. She was\ngonna be my ex-wife. She\nlooked like the daughter I\nwould go ape over if I had\nchildren. I went to her and\ntold her how great I was.\nShe was gonna share in my\ngreatness. She told me to\ngo away and people started\ndefending her. I thought of\ngrabbing her by the pussy\nbut the bouncers threw me\nout. Outside, a bunch of\nguys beat me up. I blacked\nout.\nI woke up in the hospital with a great, great\nheadache. I had so many\nbandages on. The nurse\ncame to me and was like\n\u201cAren\u2019t you that crazy\nperson who yelled that he\nwas decolonising his life?\u201d\nI said that I was Donald\nTrump. She slapped me\nand walked off. Day one of\nmaking my life great again\nwas complete. Tomorrow is\na new adventure. A great\nadventure. The best. Everyone says so. It\u2019s terrific.\n\n"
