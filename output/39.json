    "content": "z FELIX i OF S LE THE PRESIDENT AND THE HON. SECRETARY Imperial College Union Each year, on the Monday before the term opens the fresher s are in yi ted to a free tea: but before this bribe is handed out, they are herded into the Gym., pestered on their way by the talent scouts, and made to s it in mute mass on the floor, while the Master of Ceremonies, the t resident of Imperial College Union, introduces them to the distinguished feathering on the stage. This scene may resemble a charity school Speech Day, to those fresh and familiar from school; and to those students coming here via the services the setup and the encouraging spee ene s of the Union officials may remind them of the hopeful words of the entertainments and education officers in their old units. However, none should worry that this one sided situation will last. The Rector, the Secretary and the Registrar of the College will, regrettably, never again be seen during the year on this plat for ji; with the Union officers; and it will be an observant student who sees the air and army representatives of peace at all while at I.C.On lyon this occasion does the President receive a quiet audience, an a can treat them politely: Union meetings during the year are much less formal, often with the President, supported by the Honorary Secretary of the Union, defending the administration against the mob, and happiest when the Union Council's and committees' work is left in peace. These two officers are the kin fp in and prince pin of the most complicated students' union in a London college. They are at the centre of an organization comprising, on one hand, the affairs of the three constituent colleges, of Guilds, the R.C.S., and the Mines, on another, I.C.'s affiliation and responsibilities in the University Union; and all around these, the weaving connections of clubs and affairs of state at these three levels. The two officers need to be experts in four directions, and unbiased toward all. Their two personalities need to be as sanely different as possible.\" He coughed at the To sean in i concert\" FROM FAR ATTO WIDE( Continued) Northvjards went many to Sweden, Norway and Finland. V/e had no one in the Olympic Games - next time perhaps but Philip Allsopp worked i not av anger and then spent a week in the village of Saks haug. He was a great celebrity with the population, specially the children, as the first coloured man\never to go there. E.R. Wooding of Chem. Tech. spent ten days as part of the crew of an old Corni\u00bbh fishing boat in a journey from\nWeymouth to Blythe Harbour,\" beating up the Channel and the North Sea against a northerly wind. The boat was successfully navigated past sandbanks, light vessels, trawlers and\nmerchantmen, oblivious to navigation lights.\" Northerly gales and rain seem to have washed out more\nthan these instances. Your reporter caught, two colds pad all ing week by week from regatta to carnival in the Wye Valley, and other members of our staff hid themselves variously. John Midgley dived into the magnificent Black Forest, Ken\nBock went with a tent to France, and Ted Simon, once hoped to be the present saviour of Felix, failed his exams, again, and has retired to earn money in the Riviera. But stories of those who have n't returned belong to another day. Ron Mac fie, the President is a quiet man. He smokes a pipe more than he talks, and his main interest a tI.C. has been gliding. His home is the Aeronautics Department, which was reached after several pauses at Intermediate Level causing a stay with the R.A.F. between times. Though this should account for his rise since in flying he became the first member of the Gliding Club to qualify as an instructor his main experience in the service appears to have been in driving out he Burma Road. This would account for his special line in vacation work: the delivery of expensive cars, and being chauffeur to expensive passengers. He was Captain of the I. C.G.C. for two years, until last year, when the Social Clubs Committee took him for their new Chairman. From this office he was promoted President unopposed. Wally Goss, the Hon. Sec. is, by contrast, one of those tireless and harassed workers whose near fanatic efficiency and thorough interpretation of their duties often tempts colleagues to s it back and let such energetic ones do all. But' Sally also possesses the saving grace of those with such capacity for responsibility: he enjoys life, and suffers fools as all must. He rose in college athletic circles, first to Secretary of the SoccerClub, and as the official cricket umpire, to become in torn Secretary and then last year's Chairman of the Athletic Clubs Committee. In University circles he is well known as a soccer referee, and in the last three years has been an officer of the U.L. SoccerClub, and was joint organizer6 f their tour of Kenya a year ago. It is recorded that he, an on playing member, was their only casualty in a game: he injured his knee while refereeing. ADV ICS TO YOUNG LADIES IN LOVE\" Let him compare the e to a summer's day, For the n't is sure that always you will reign\". Thus spake the Bard, but ladies, let me say More practical advice may spare much pain. Fair Lucy lavished all her charm Upon her favourite beau And worried lest the slightest harm Should cause him any woe. With this in mind, she undertook To supervise his life, But he, stout fellow, would not brook Such conduct in a wife. That was the end of Lucy' s plan,S he stayed upon the shelf. Thus, if you want to please your man, Then let him please himself. Watt a Wordsworth. The Union Hairdreser\nOpen Mondays and Friday s9am. to6 pm. Appointments can be made for anytime.

U. Boat house at Chiswick which is shared by most of the remaining colleges. The high standards encouraged by such facilities have resulted in the college being the holders of a number of U.L. Cups including the Rug ger, Boxing, Shooting, CrossCountry and Sailing Cups, the Men's Badminton championship and many other titles and positions. We look to the Freshman' s support to maintain our position. THE SABIN TANKARD\nOn Saturday,11 th October,1952, the I. C.B.C. began the new season by winning the Autumn Clinker Eights for the Sab in Tankard. The first heat pre sei ted no difficulties and was won by% n lengths, the crew keeping their blades well covered, and drawing away every stroke. The final was, however, a much more\nexciting race, resulting in a win by3 feet from Fur niv al R.C. with Weybridge3 feet behind them. Let us hope this good start will augur^ well for the season.

The Summer Regattas At Henley Royal Regatta, I.C. was represented in the Thames Cup by the l st VIII. They were drawn in their heat against the best English crew in the event, Christ' s College, Cambridge, who were later to have the great misfortune to catch a\" crab\" in the final when leading by1* lengths and seeming certain to bring the trophy back to this country for the first time since1946. On Wednesday,2 nd July, giving away nearly a stone in weight per man into a headwind, the I.C. crew rowed well. After a good start, there was\nlittle to choose between the crews until the top of the island, when the wind made itself felt and Christ' s began to go ahead. The Barrier was reached in2 min.3 sec. and at Fawley(3 min.30 sec.) Christ' s were nearly two lengths a he ad.I.C. however, never got ratt ted and reduced this to just uri ler a length at the beginning of the enclosures. Christ' s, however, in their final spurt increased the distance to\\\\ lengths at the finish. The time,7 min.,19 sec was the fifth fastest of the day. CREW. G.W. Benson( Bow); C.B. Stevens; J.P.

Though. they were not successful in winning an event, their keenness and general good fellowship did not a little to enhance the good name of the I. C.B.C. During this time the crew received un stinted hospitality from U.C.S.B oat Club and Kingston Rowing Club, to whom\nall thanks are due for an enjoyable summer's rowing.

C.G.C.( Frank Irving, Mike Neale and George Gregory) made up the ground crew of one of the British entries to the International competition in Spain this summer. They contributed in no small way to the success of the British entry which, incidentally, received neglig able attention in the national press. After the usual hazards of travelling and the additional one of trailer instability, the crew and pilot( Lo me Welch) arrived safely. The roads, which were, of course, the concern of the ground crew in their retrieving work, proved to be quite good despite several rather intimidating road signs. Due largely to excellent radio communication or other equipment which really worked, the Rr it ish crews were always first back to base and were usually sunning themselves by the swimming pool when\nthe other teams came crawling back twelve hours or so later. There were many pleasant impressions brought back from Spain but one warning from the heart to prospective tourists beware egg and bacon soup. ATHLETIC FIXTURES SATURDAY.OCTOBER 1 8 TH. I.C.

    "content": "FELIX s COMMEMORATION DAY Until 1907 when our three Colleges were\nfederated to form the Imperial College, the R.C.S. and the 'Mines' were administered by the Board of\nEducation, and the 'Guilds' by the City & Guilds\nof London Institute, which founded it in 1884\nunder the name The Central Technical College.\nOn 25th October, 1946 celebrations were held\nto mark the Centenary of the earliest part of\nI.C., the Royal College of Chemistry. This\noccasion saw the largest gathering of members of\nI.C. ever known, and the celebrations were attended by H.M. the King, Visitor to the College, and\nH.M. the Queen.\nIn 1947 it happened that 25th October v/ as\nchosen for the first of a new institution of\nInaugural Lectures, planned to open each College\nYear. This coincidence led to the naming of\nthat date Commemoration Day, and in 1948 the\npresent ceremony was adopted, to start with a College Procession to the Great Hall of the\nUniversity, in Imperial Institute Road, where a presentation of graduates and diplomats was held,\nfollowed by an address by a distinguished visitor. In 1949 the distinguished visitor was the Rt.\nHon. Herbert Morrison, and in 195\"0 Sir Bruce white\ndeputized on the death of Lord Wavell, who had\naccepted the invitation for that year. Last year\nthe ceremony was coupled with the Centenary of the\n'Mines', and the visitor was Sir Andrew McCance,\none of the most eminent graduates of the Royal\nSchool.\nThis year the special visitor is Dr. Karl7. O on pt on, Hon, C. B.E.,D.S c,D.S ng., Ph.D., LL. D., Chair nan of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before he gives his Address, he will he presented with the Scroll of his Honor ry Fellowship of Imperial College, which lie was elected in1949. In honour of the occasion this ceremony will be attended by the United States Ambassador,!! r.( lif'ford. The Scroll of Honorary Fellowship will also be presented to Sir Frederick Tandley Page, who was elected in1951,. and\nto Honorary Fellow selected during this year. The Commemoration Day ceremony is followed\nby an evening Conversazione, held in turn in the\nthree college?- This year it is the turn of the\nGuilds. The final item in the Programme is the\nUnion Commemoration Ball, on the Friday; which\nwill be held again this year in Grosvenor House.\nTHE TERM IN GENERAL The social year a tI.C.o pens'.''1 th the energetic entertainment of Fresher s, and the athletic programme with the series of trials an a training gem es; after which the term takes a month to settled own.

The vacation started with the Dramatic Society' s venturing out to a week's public performance, of a Priestley play at Cheltenham in a university season there. Though they had good rea.son to feel satisfied with their production, they shared in a patch of poor support at the theatre. i At this time the late President and VicePresident of the \u2022fines David Griffiths raid John( Knocker) white took a temporary job near college\" as assistant morticians. For af ev; days they fed ea; ers upper audiences with episodes in the stiffening of a\" stiff\" until their increasing suntan betrayed that their w n nl oy ment was. in fact, gardening. The' Devon cricket tour is reported, as is the Dramatic Society' stour, in the next Phoenix, but we are allowed to reveal that this year they won some games. It is not generally expected, or really desired, to get such a result. We\nfeel that the Game, the Tour and the Drink are The Things: to win is not quite cricket. With great regrets, the.. Sept-ember rug ger tour to Delft of Jack How or th' s XV fell through because when the time came, those who were available and able to find the ca.sh, amounted to only six forwards and one back. One of the team,Bill Robinson, was already training by, he\nclaims, shark fishing in Cornwall. Other Miners' and Geologists' tales tellus of Godfrey\nBurr ill in Labrador, George S wales in Ca.nada, and Anton Brown\nin Goose Bay. John Taylor went to Kuwait, and has sketched us a perfectly blank picture of the countryside inland of the oilfields. The chairman of the Athletic Clubs Committee went on a nearly tour by car of the Lakes and the Road to the Isles He feels so ,y \u00bb-\u2022<.-\u00bb about the COOTI11UCUS rain that we are not mentioning his name. His' opp o, the chairman of the S.

A. seem to have been Buenos Aires, by Mary HeX enz ie( though this doesn't really count as it's her home), and by Barbara Harris who went to be governess wearing poke bonnet v/e trust to two Italian children in i Rome.\nThe prize for Vac.

We hope that our older supporters\nwill find most of our pages of interest, and we\ntake this opportunity of welcoming them and the\n\"Freshers\" to I.C. for the new college year.\nWe all remember ( don't we ?) our own first few bewildered dr.ys tis Fresher s! when we first gazed with uno ert a in eyes at the strangeness of it all. We were confused, we\nlost our way, we talked to strangers, and accepted whatever came next, all rather meekly and naively. V/e went to free teas, drank much beer, listened to speeches and sales talk from professors and club captains. Come one, come all, A few lectures would be sta.rting in a day or two, and\nalthough the idea of work had not then penetrated the con cio us ness, we might per hp s go along, if only not to miss anything. So went each day, frill of new impressions. By the time you have read this, you will already have\nhad ten drys of the life, and be getting used to it all. Gradually you are dram into lectures; the free dinners will ta.il off, the exhortations wil\" diminish in intensity, and, caught in the snares of the lecture room and laboratory, you\"111 realise that the honeymoon is over. But cheer up ! The daily round here is quite lively. Things do happen here! You will find life pleasant enough if you do your part. Join a club, society but not too many - and take an active interest in the affairs of your college. Finally remember to do some work - even in this your first terra - out don't become a brown bagge r;r university is more than a vocational training centre. It is \u2022\n:\n\u2022 sect of learning, where you'.\"' ill spend some of the happiest and most useful years of your life. The present system of bombardment by poster\nand free tea, fails to move many of the lar pe number of post-graduate Freshers to take an interest in the Union. Distinct from both i>e new wave\nof young undergraduates each year, and the I.C. graduates continuing their stay here, the senior\nstudents coming in from outside are not flattered\nby being treated as one of the Fresher mass.\nSuch men have often plenty to offer, and to\ngain, by dipping into Union activities. For many\nof them there are facilities at I.C. which they\nwill not have had the opportunity of using before,\nBut the majority of post-graduate3 work in small\ngroups, or on their own, and do not get whirled\ninto things in the short time they are here.\nPerhaps next year the main Freshers Hay\nmeeting might be pre cee ded by one in which the\nPresident meets the new post-grads separately.\nA free drink in the place of a free tea might be\nappropriate.\nf ii a cu a ji J nf a he 0j>e ned by stu Jen t i;t uni inquiries to th \u00a3 UMIOM office.

Cur circulation is spreading, and our sale in The Greater Manchester area alone bas doubled in the past Year. It has therefore been decided to print city notices only, on the frontpage, in future issues. A mock layout of the new\nstyle is shown here. The improved value of this is quickly realised. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Dear Sir, , j. On the first day of the General Studies lectures a college club called a general meeting,\nadmittedly of some urgency a3 well as of import-ance, but which prevented some of us from attending the lectures. I hope that the principle is\nto be adopted that this new scheme is to be given\na chance by the Tuesday and Thursday lunch hours\nbeing kept free, at the lecture times, from\nroutine meetings.\nYours etc., 67\nI.C. Political Society,11 th October19 b2. Dear Sir, The World at present finds itself with a cp st6ra of government the structure of which relies upon what is known as politics, and it happens that some people disagree with the particular politicians in power at any particular time or even with the system in general. we are fortunately(?) not blessed with such dissatisfaction in this College since no less than98. of the students are apparently perfectly satisfied with the government of the country whoever is in power, for the Political Society never receives any complaints, communications or attendance from them. However, some doubtlessly do not e.g ree with this view and may utter some worn out slogan about \" Tory warmongers\" or\" Socialism leads to Communism\" to justify their belated annoyance. Sir, they do\nnot know what they are talking about. They may k nov/ some-thing of questions about germ warfare and education cuts, but these are not politics since they can be answered by\nsomebody just telling the truth. No, if somebody thinks he\nreally knows something about politics he may like to try- and\nanswer the following questions i \"Why does the Russian Government consider that there is little difference between\nthe Conservative and Labour parties in Britain?\",\" What exactly is this Sevan business all about and would you consider the movement to be dependent upon Devan himself?\", and \"What are the economic implications of a Cartel?\" or even \"what is a Cartel?\". But I do not suppose that there are mere than half a dozen people rea.ding this letter that could answer these questions satisfactorily even though they are matters of topical interest. I am not so much directing this at the Socialists in the college as they do demonstrate some interest in politics, but I am directing it to Labour Party members and Conservatives( yes, there is a difference between a Socialist and a Labour man, do we all know what it is?). I am especially directing it to the Conservatives. They come to college, their heads\nfull of ideas( if they have been Y. C.'s) on hew to run a dance or hold a table tennis tournament, but a.s for politics... There is a true story of theY. C. committee meeting at which a young and enthusiastic member had the creditable idea that they should run political discussion groups. But an older and wiser me mb Br reminded them that the Communists\nmight attend, and not being prepared to argue against them\nin debate the assembled company gasped with fright and\npromptly dropped the whole idea. 'Well Sir, I'll have done. But I would like to remind readers that the ma.jor politic a.1 groups will be starting to have\nmeetings soon, and so will the society itself. Perhaps they would like to come along to one of the meetings and discuss the questions which I have asked?. Yours faithfully, Hugh C.G rig g.(H on. Sec.( Political Society). The Editor, Felix. H.C. S.,5.W.7 Dear Sir,\nI wish you to convey to all the students of\nthe R.C. Science my appreciation for the kindness\nand respect they have always shown towards me\nduring the years that I have been in charge of the\ndoor at the R.C.S. It has been a pleasure to\nwork with such a fine lot of students, although\nI will not be with you this next term they can\nrest assured that my thoughts will be with them\nall, and I wish them all the luck and prosperity\nin the days to come.\nNow on my retirement after 58 years at the\ngrindstone, I hope to sit back in my fire side\neasy chair which the Professors and Staff of the\n3.0. Science have so kindly presented to me on my\nretirement.\nWell Cheerio to you all and good luck,\n(WALLY)\nW.B. Brig den, X. Messenger R.0.S. Letters are invited on any and every subject.\nThey should be short where possible. Correspondents MUST supply their name and college, but they\nmay write under a nom-de-plume if they wish. The\nEditor takes no responsibility for the opinions\nexpressed by correspondents.\nWe apologize in advance for the production standard of thi? issue, but it was done with half the usual staff. "
