    "content": "REVIEWS\nMoscow Gold\nGorbachev's glasnost and per estro ick a are\narguably responsible for some of the most\nsignificant events on a global scale since\nthe end of WWII. His struggles to rebuild\nthe Soviet economy are still going on\neven as you read this. Surely then, it is a trifle early to be staging a play about the\nRussian leader? Apparently the RSC think\nnot.\nThe basis of the story will be familiar to\nanyone who has read papers or watched\ntelevision reasonably frequently over the\nlast five years. The play gives us a chance to consolidate what we know and\nto be shown little pieces of information\nthat have not really entered the public\nconsciousness, for example, did you know\nthat Andropov was Gorbachev's mentor?\nInsights into the character of the man\nhimself are not to be expected. Despite\nDavid Calder's more than competent\nperformance, we see no more of him\nthan his state man persona, even in a Ghost This film has much in common with\nbrown bread; to wit, it is thoroughly\nwholesome, full of moral fibre and\nbursting with goodness. Also like brown\nbread, it contains no gratuitous killings,\nPatrick Swayze and a modicum of\nhumour. Unlike the aforementioned\ndietary staple, it contains one swear-word\nand Whoopi Goldberg. However it's also\nmore entertaining that brown bread and\nalso features a plot.\nBriefly stated the storyline goes; he's alive, he's dead and then he hangs\naround a lot. Demi Moore, as his\ngirlfriend, is naturally somewhat upset\nabout the second of these events and\nexhibits this by bursting into tears at any\ngiven moment. Since Patrick doesn't make it to the end of the first reel you\nwill be pleased to hear he spends his time\nmassage scene with his wife he asks her\nto pummel various parts of his anatomy,\nnaming them in turn after his problems.\nDespite this, the play doesn't stay\nwithin the realms of do cu drama. Nancy\nReagan's astrologer descends from the\nsky, asking a food queue if they are\nwaiting for theatre tickets, before\nlaunching into a song and dance routine.\nSequences of politburo politic ing are\nmixed with biz are e symbolic tableaux\nwalking through objects, people and\nstartling kitty-cats. This continues until he\nhappens upon a medium named Oda Mae\nBrown (Ms Goldberg herself) who is\nstaggered to discover that she can\nactually hear the dead, after a busy\nlifetime of fleecing the ignorant. Oda Mae\nthen has the enviable task of convincing\nDemi that she is in contact with her\nstiffed fiance. There then follows a sequence of sensitive (read ikk y sticky)\nemotional reunions until Demi finally Sees\nThe Light and Patrick can explain the\nDastardly Plot to her. Because, you see,\nPatrick was Taken Before His Time and,\npowerless to affect the physical world,\nmust communicate his beloved's Dire\nPlight to her. The only 'people' he can\ntalk to are his fellow denizens of the\nafter world who seem content to leave\nCommunion On the surface, this film suffers from\nwhat could be the worst piece of\nmiscasting in history. Being a film about\naliens, why has Christopher Walken (The\nDeer Hunter, Dead Zone) been chosen to\nplay the lead role of a human, when he\nlooks so much like an alien in the first\nplace?\nThe answer reveals itself in the\nwatching of the film. Christopher Walken\nmanages to portray a frightened man,\ntrying to come to terms with what he has\nseen, with such skill that his resemblance\nto E.T. seems totally trivial.\nSo, what has the man seen and, more\nimportantly, what do we see? Well, if you\nare expecting a re-run of Close\nEncounters of the Third Kind, then you\nwill be sorely disappointed. This is a very\npersonal account of some very strange\nincidents in a man's life and, since they\nare intended to be true, their reason will\nnever be explained in the film.\nThis leaves us with a film which is\nrather sparse on material for the SF\nenthusiast and quite thin on plot line for\nthe film buff. Despite slowing down at the\nend, the film is a good watch for anybody\nwith an open mind who is prepared to\naccept the supernatural as possible and is\nwilling to view the film as at least a possible scenario of alien encounter. For\nand scenes of Russian home life.\nThis is a fairly lightweight piece of\npolitical drama which is certainly far\ninferior to the protest plays of writers like\nVaclav Havel, who is in fact quoted in\nthe programme. It is clearly a play\nwritten by an outsider, which\nunfortunately results in little of the feeling\nbeing caught. It does though make an\ninteresting counterpoint to the pre-revolution Barbarians still being staged in\nthe Barbican. It's definitely not great\ntheatre, but it manages to be reasonable\nentertainment, so if your knowledge of\nrecent events in the USSR is a tad shaky\nthis is worth a look.\nMoscow Gold is in repertoire in the\nBarbican Theatre, with student standby's available half an hour before the\nperformance on production of a Union\nCard and a five pound note. The nearest\ntube is Barbican.\nPendragon.\nhim to it. Many unpleasant events follow,\nbut Our Hero manages to maintain his\nHovis-like determination to the bitter end.\nWhich, as you may guess, is not\nparticularly bitter.\nSpecial effects are excellent, although\nalmost entirely concerned with the\npassage of the dearly departed solid\nobjects and well-trained feline gymnastics.\nThe plot, while heavily predictable,\nmanages to neatly package every social\ninsecurity known to mankind and come\nout smiling. Again, unlike brown bread.\nA film for all the family, including the\ndead ones.\n(The Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nwould not like to thank the staff at the\nEmpire for their complete lack of\nco-operation.)\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine.\nthose of you who have read the book,\nthe film sticks quite closely to the story\nline, with a couple of extra incidents\nincluded to show off the aliens.\nStef Smith.\n\n"

    "content": "H Power Swamped\nA massive power failure closed the\nMechanical Engineering Department on\nWednesday 10th October. A flood was\nreported at 11.45am and power was lost\nat 12.00. Geoff Reeves, Imperial College\nChief Security Officer, said that a water\ntank on the eighth floor burst and the\ndrainage system couldn't cope. Some of\nthe water went into the main power\nducts supplying the Mechanical\nEngineering building causing a circuit\nbreaker to cut the supply.\nMany people thought that there had\nbeen an explosion and called security. All\nfloors lost power except for the\nbasement, first and second. The lifts and\nphones were not affected and lighting\nswitched to the emergency backup.\nThe Mechanical Engineering Building\nwas emptied and sealed at dusk. The\nmainframe computer was not hit as it has\nit's own power supply but data was lost\nfrom Personal Computers on mains\nsupply.\nCaught Review Technical\nMr Geoff Reeves, College security\nofficer, has warned the college about a walk-in the if who has been active in the\narea. He is described as black, tall (about\nsix foot) and slim, wearing black track suit trousers. Mr Reeves said that it would be\nworth while to challenge any strangers.\nHe added that bicycle the ives are\nhaving a great time now that the new\nintake is here. He said that D locks are\nfor sale at cost price from the security\nroom in Sherfield as the cable locks used\nby first years in particular are no use\nwhatever.\nThe opening hours of the Haldane music\nlibrary are to be put under review,\naccording to Mr Richard Hall, Lyon\nPlayfair sub- librarian. He said that the\npresent hours of 11.00 until 4.00 in the\nafternoon was due to a redistribution of\nstaff in the library so that books could be\nissued for longer and the issue of music\ncould be guaranteed for those hours. He\nsaid that the library was looking at\nalternative and less time consuming ways\nof issuing cassettes.\nThe Lego Motor Show, Auto 2000, opens\ntoday at the Science Museum and runs\nuntil the 24th March. Entrance is free to\nmembers of IC on production of a union\ncard.\nThe exhibition is on the third floor and\ncontains a hands-on area, a shop and an\nexhibition of models of futuristic cars. A full size prototype and a1:3.5 scale\nmodel of a Lamborghini Countach L. P400S\nare on display in the foyer.\nNightmare on Queens Lawn\nThe Union faces college wrath over the\nsiting of the Careers Fair on the Queens\nLawn. Estates had given Dave Ensel,\nCareers Fair Manager, permission to use\nthe lawn but top level officials, including\nthe Rector, had not been consulted.\nYesterday, when work started on the\nerection of the marquee, contractors\nvehicles parked in an area of the college\ncar park which was to be used by some\nvisiting VIP's. The marquee has also caused two other\nproblems. The company providing stands\nto go inside the marquee had measured\nthe size of the Queens Lawn incorrectly.\nThis was corrected by the marquee\ncompany removing two panels from the\nside of the marquee, shortening it by\neight metres. They have not charged the\nUnion for doing this.\nThe other problem has also been\ncaused by the stand company. They want\nthe Union to purchase special armoured\ncable for the electrics. This is normally\nonly used for permanent installations and\nwould cost the Union \u00a31300. The Union\nwere told of this requirement on\nThursday morning. Dave Ensel\ncommented to Felix, 'It's all gone horribly\nwrong'\nThe Careers Fair will run next tuesday\nand Wednesday (16th/17 th October) and\nwill be free to all students, from Imperial\nand other colleges. There will be\n2\nrefreshments and a bar available inside\nthe marquee.\nThe Union expect 5000 visitors to the\nFair, 3000 of which will receive a glossy\nconference folder in which to place the\nCareers Fair brochure, providing\ninformation on all the companies in the\nfair. This year the cost of attending has\nbeen increased drastically - up to \u00a31075\nfor a two day stall. The extra cost has\nnot proved to be a deterrent to\ncompanies, for the extra revenue has\nbeen used to provide a better service to\nboth the companies and the students\nvisiting the fair.\nIncluded in the cost of the stall is the\n\u00a315,000 cost of the purpose built\naluminium marquee. This was the\nbrainchild of Dave Ensal who visited\nEuropean Careers Fairs this year. He also\nproduced the idea of providing\npartitioned stands for visiting companies.\nThey also get two pages in the Fair's brochure.\nThis year the Union lost 30 companies,\nmainly petro-chemical and banks due to a change in the market. They gained over\n30 \"industrial companies, however,\nincluding BP research, ICI and Unileaver.\nThere will also be several international\ncompanies and a stall run by international\nstudents (the B.E.S.T. stall).\nBen Turner, the Careers Fair\nCoordinator, has arranged for two parties\nto be held in the marquee before it is\nremoved and for the profits from 'The\nBig Gig' on the 23rd and 24th October to\nbe donated to the Careers Fair fund.\nFurther information on Careers can be\nobtained from the Careers Advisory\nService, on the 3rd floor of Sherfield.\n\n"

She crouches in a zombie-like\ntrance while the rest of the street-gang\nshoot it out with the police. Several\ndeaths ensue and Nikita tops it all off\nwith the murder of the policeman who\nfinds her hiding.\nHer family are told that she is dead and\nshe is whisked off to be trained as a government assassin. Not content with\nteaching her just to use a gun, the\ngovernment have to rehabilitate her so\nthat she can live in society like a normal\nwoman. While learning to smile and\napply make-up she also acquires some\nuseful techniques for killing.\nBob (Tcheky Karyo), her instructor,\ntreats her to a birthday dinner and a rather special birthday present which she\nuses to great effect on her first mission.\nIt's now time for Nikita to go out into the\nworld.

When it becomes apparent\nthat the Union is not totally on the\nmember's side, they decide to take things\ninto their own hands.\nThis is a typically Irish play from\naward-winning playwright Frank\nMcGuinness appropriately staged in the\nTricycle in the middle of Kilburn. The\nCatholic undertones are all there, and\nthere is something about the characters\nand their attitudes to the English that is\nquint essentially Irish. The situation is\nbleak, the remedy doomed to failure and\nthe outlook gloomy.\nLuckily, underlying it all is a feeling of\ncompanionship and endurance that\ndevelops as the ladies get to know each\nother in the course of their ordeal.

    "content": "V FEATURES\nPart 2 on the ground display. Text and pictures by Roland Flowerdew.\nFarnborough International 1990 V FEATURES\n'The shadow of a Sukhoi' Sukhoi Su-27\nWhile many people go to the\nFarnborough airshow to see the air\ndisplay, the static displays are equally\nimpressive, with the latest technology and\ninnovations often being on view for the\nfirst time. This week's feature on the\nairshow concentrates on some of the\ninteresting ground and exhibition displays\nseen this year,\nHOTOL\nThe prospects of the HOTOL project\ngetting off the ground seem much more\nlikely with the announcement of a study\ninto the feasibility of using the Antonov\nAn-225 Mriya (Dream) to piggyback\nHOTOL part way into space. BAe has\nbeen negotiating with the Soviet Ministry\nof Aviation to use the aircraft as a low-cost launch platform. The An-225 was\noriginally designed to aid in the Soviet\nspace program as a transport, and has a proven ability to carry vehicles on its\nback: last year when displaying at the\nParis airshow, it brought the Soviet space\nshuttle 'Buran' in in this fashion.\nThe new proposal breaths life into the\nproject, which was refused funding by the\nUK government despite the promise of a cheap method for launching satellites,\nbecause the revolutionary dual mode\npropulsion system need not be used. This\nsystem caused the now-temporary\nshelving of the project, because the\nMinistry of Defence insisted on keeping\nthe engine technology secret, thus barring\ninternational funding of the project.\nThe proposal is that the An-225 will\ntake HOTOL up to 30,000 ft where the\ntwo craft will separate, and HOTOL will\nuse interim, Soviet-derived rocket motors\nto launch itself into orbit. The study will\nconduct wind tunnel tests to determine\nthe viability and safety at the moment of\nseparation. The combination should be\nable to put into orbit a payload of up to 7\ntonnes, at under half the current cost.\nSupersonics\nBritish Aerospace (BAe) and Aerospatiale,\nthe builders of Concorde, have been\nworking separately on the next\ngeneration of supersonic transports (SST).\nThey have now decided to share all\ninformation although the designs each has\nproduced so far are too different to be\namalgamated. Recently a wider study has\nbegun between BAe, Aerospatiale,\nBoeing, McDonnell-Douglas and Deutsche\nAirbus. The basic requirements of such an\naeroplane are that it should be capable of\naround Mach 2-2.5, while carrying up to\n300 passengers over 10,000 km. At the\nsame time it must be environmentally\nacceptable, with low noise, and good\neconomy so that operation is profitable.\nSuch an aircraft is unlikely to be flying\nbefore 2000, with another 10 years before\nit enters service. '\nSNECMA and Rolls-Royce, the\ncollaborators for the Concorde engines\nare also engaged in a joint study on SST\npropulsion. Any such engine will need to\nbe variable cycle - running as a turbofan\nfor subsonic flight, and as a turbojet while\nsupersonic - to meet economy and noise\nrequirements. Rolls-Royce is less\nenthusiastic about developing an SST\nengine because of the limited number\nrequired: the faster an aircraft travels, the\nfewer required to carry a given number\nof passengers a certain distance in a specified time period.\nBoth Japan and the Soviet Union are\nalso interested in developing an SST, and\nit is possible that they will join with the\nfive companies above in producing such\nan aircraft.\nSukhoi and Gulfstream have been\ncollaborating in a venture to build a supersonic biz-jet. In order for the\nprogram to be justified, a minimum of\n100 examples would have to be sold at\naround 40 million US dollars each, but it\nis believed that such a market exists.\nSukhoi reckon that up to 20 could be sold\nto the Soviet authorities. Gulfstream had\na model of the Mach 2 biz-jet on their\nstand, but a detailed specification is yet to\nbe finalised, although it will probably\ncarry up to 16 passengers with 3 crew\nover a range of 4000 nmi. Engine design\nstudies are being carried by Lyulka of\nUSSR and Rolls-Royce. A proof-of-concept\nprototype is expected to fly around 1994,\nwith full production by 1998.\nNew Engines\nRolls-Royce had on display an example of\ntheir new engine, the Trent turbofan.\nThis engine is being developed to meet\nthe increasing thrust requirements of new\nairliners: current engine designs can\nproduce over 60,000 lbs thrust, but are\nreaching the end of their development\nlife. The Trent has been designed to\nproduce thrust in the range 60,000 to\n90,000 lbs, and has already been ordered\nby several airlines to power McDonnellDouglas MD-11 and Airbus A330 airliners.\nThe new engine uses the latest\ntechnology in its wide-chord fan, which\nuses fewer but wider blades than in a conventional turbofan.\nThe advantages of this configuration\ninclude greater fuel efficiency, and\ngreater resistance to bird-strike and other\ningested foreign bodies The engine was\ntest-run in August of this year, giving it a head-start on its rivals, the General\nElectric GE90 and Pratt & Whitney\nPW4082. It seems likely that Boeing will\nuse the Trent in its new airliner, the\n767-X, later to be known as the 777.\nHowever, General Electric claim that\ntheir engine will be more suitable for the\n767-X as this will require thrusts of over\n85,000 lbs, for which the GE90 is\nspecifically designed.\nNo Stealth\nThe Civil Aviation Authority showed\nexamples of the new radar systems used\nfor air traffic control. These displayed\nimages of the current state of the skies\nover a user-selectable area: up to the\nwhole of the South of England could be\nseen on the screen. Unfortunately, none\nof the air traffic controllers on the stand\nseemed to know how to use the system...\nThe United States Air Force (USAF) had\non static display a Lockheed TR-1, the\nlong-winged and black painted high flying\nspy plane. The type is due to be re-engined next year, replacing the '50s technology system currently in use. The\nnew engines are lighter and more fuel-efficient, thus increasing the range of the\naircraft. The type is expected to stay in\nservice for many more years for airborne\nintelligence purposes. The USAF missed\nstealing the show by not bringing another\nproduct from the Lockheed hangers, the\nF117 stealth fighter, to Farnborough.\nThey claimed that the 2.4 km runway\nwas not long enough for the aeroplane.\nLockheed has delivered all examples built\nto the USAF, hence were unable to bring\none over themselves.\nThe new Boeing 767-X, which will\nreceive official approval providing\nsufficient orders are obtained, may have\nfolding wing-tips. The envisaged wingspan of the aeroplane is 198 ft, compared\nto the 211 ft of the Boeing 747-400, the\nlatest long-range version. The advantage\nof such a system is that airport gates\ndesigned for use with aircraft such as the\nBoeing 707 will be able to be used. The\ndisadvantage is the additional weight and\ncost penalty, but Boeing say that the\npercentage weight increase would be\nminimal. Whether such a system will be\nfitted will depend entirely on what the\nmajority of customers require.\nSikorsky displayed their flying dough-nut, the Cypher, on their stand. The\nproof-of-concept prototype consists of an\nouter ring six feet in diameter\u2014the\ndoughnut\u2014with two contra-rotating rotors\ninside, one above the other, so there are\nno torque effects. The rotors are powered\nby two model aero-engines buried inside\nthe doughnut, and no other control\nsurfaces are required. Intended usage\nincludes remote pilot less surveillance and\nlaw-enforcement.\nAccording to Flight Daily News, an\nairshow newspaper, someone was found\ntraining a thermal imaging device on\nyoung women walking the aisles of the\nhalls. The device revealed all the body's hot-spots, and was said to be particularly\ngood at revealing black silk and nylon.\nConcorde: Successor in sight?\nBritish Aerospace by Sarah Harland\nBritish Aerospace (BAe) had the most\nprominent exhibition this year, with two\nsizeable outdoor display parks, advertising\nboth civil and military aspects of their\nwork, as well as a line of chalets and\nnotable display in the halls.\nThe better presented of the parks\nshowed Military Defence. The set route\ntoured land and air vehicles, weapons\nand systems, all set against a background\nof combat conditions. The emphasis on\nthe recent acquisition of Rover Group was\nfulfilled with a Land Rover and Discovery\nliaison vehicle on show. The latter runs\non a2.5 litre turbo-diesel engine and\ncarries seven passengers, particularly\nuseful for police work. Among weapons\ndemonstrated was the new Laserfire\nsystem. This is a development of the\nRapier low level air defence system\nwhich can be mounted on a single\nvehicle. It offers milli metric surveillance\nradar and laser tracker making it fully\nautomatic. As it is also air-portable, it can\nrapidly be brought into action.\nMilitary aircraft on display included the\nnew Hawk version, the 200, the Tornado\nIDS, Tornado ADV, two Harrier GR5s\nunder camouflage netting, and a military\nfreighter variant of the BAe 146, the\n146-STA, complete with air-to-air\nrefuelling probe.\nIn the civilian park were two more 146\nversions, the -200 and -300QT 'Quiet\nTrader'. The latter is again a freighter\nversion, currently used by TNT, the\ncourier company. It has a side loading\ndoor and pallet system: one of the pallets\nwas shown with a Rover Metro on it.\nOn their hall stand, BAe was operating\nan innovative computer training system.\nThe Integrated Computer Based Training\nsystem uses a standard PC with a touch\nsensitive screen to familiaris ea potential\npilot with an aircraft and its system\noperations. Each student will study at an\nindividual terminal, being led through\nevery item of cockpit equipment, and is\nthen invited to operate it himself by\nturning the dials on the screen. It\nreplaces the OHP in conventional classes,\nhaving the benefits of individual tuition,\nand freeing the instructor. The pupil can\nthus perform his 90 hrs training\nwhenever he chooses. The system also\nreplaces complex and specialist\ninstrument replicas for basic hands-on\nfamiliaris ation and training, and, available\nin any language, is a cheaper and readily\ntransportable aid for foreign customers. It\ncan simulate more real conditions and\ntasks than a conventional system.\n\n"

    "content": "Wham-bam-a WEEK\nThe Freshers' Week events are definitely\nthe place to be. For those of you who\nmissed out on tickets or were too pissed\nto remember, it was great fun.\nThe Week kicked off with the New\nYear's Party. Two bands and a disco\nextravaganza lay in store. Walking into\nBeit Quad you were met by an\nimpressive sight. The walls of the Union\nBuilding had been lit up with projected\nimages of spiders webs, arrows and\nbroadway. Jean Michelle-Jarre eat your\nheart out. And if that was not good\nenough the inside was even better.\nSwirling elephants, ultra-violet lights and\narty pictures everywhere.\nFirst stop before the bands; the Cocktail\nBar. Banana Banshees (yummy), Killer\nZombies and Ocean Rollers, but no\nstraws. The Rugby Club would profit\nmore if they didn't drink it all themselves.\nThe first band on was Ruff Ruff and\nReady. They looked it! A psycho-billy on\nlead guitar, a trainee MacDonalds\nmanager on bass, a skinhead on drums\nand two singers. The resulting sound is\nnot di similar to Big Audio Dynamite. An\nunderlying reggae rock ry th mn with punk\nthrash choruses. The majority of their\nsongs did not agree with Imperial's Conservative views as in Robbing the\nRich to Feed the Poor, but at least they\nhave a couple of silly songs such as\nErrection. The best part of the band was\nthe highly animated, ethnic dancing. They\nwere amusing and fun to watch.\nThe main band of the night was the\nLevellers. Playing j iggy Irish folk music\nfor most of the time, they were similar in\nsound to Pogues and looked like New\nModel Army (although they obviously\ncould not afford the clogs). I was\nexpecting something brilliant from this\nband, but I was disappointed. With the\nusual handful of political songs I couldn't help thinking I 've heard and seen it all\nbefore. As for their last song it was a rehash of the Happy Mondays. At least the\nfire alarm relieved this torment for a bit.\nThe Levellers did not aid the evacuation\nhowever but played on even when the\nlights had been turned off and several\nUnion officers had told them to stop.\nTo end the evening the Levellers and\nRuff Ruff and Ready got together to play\none of the latter's songs. But because of\nthe fire alarm only half the people were\nleft to appreciate it.\nThe big event of the night was Disco\nAmnesia \"90 (unforgettable!) starring some\nextremely famous DJs who no one had\nheard of or really cared about. The noise\nthey were playing was LOUD. The lights\nwere amazingly impressive (better than a lot of night clubs). I will admit it I hate\n'Rave' music, but I think half the people\nthere would prefer to dance to a wide\nvariety of musical tastes. And at least\neverybody would be happy at some\nstage.\nMy urge to dance was satisfied when\nthe Lounge rocked to sounds of Abba and\nthe Bee Gees. I could have sworn they\nwere more people in the Lounge than\nDisco Amnesia '90.\nWho the hell was that band upstairs? I can now reveal that they were none\nother than the Wild Angels. Playing pure\nRock 'n' Roll all night long this was one\nbunch of cool dudes. They had the\npunters dancing and for the last song\n(which went on and on) one of the\naudience played the drums. This was the\nplace to sit down, relax and chat. They\nwere great, so why weren't they billed?\nlaughed at this year's come dien s. The com per e of the evening, Jeff\nGreen, knew his stuff and was good.\nPlaying on American-Iraq affairs and\nthose IC statistics (no women) we all\nknow too well. He had the audience in\nhysterics before the acts came on,\nproviding perfect introductions.\nThe first act of the night was Simon\nDay. Specialising in impressions of 'House'\nParties and American screen stars, neatly\ntimed to backing tracks. This is where the\nproblem lay it was all too neat and\nsmooth. The jokes were lost beneath it,\n1\nOne last drink, a burger and then it was\noff to bed.\nRecollections of last year's Comedy\nNight meant I was not overjoyed with the\nprospect of going to this one (all the jokes\nhad been based on masturbation,\ncondoms and fucking). I was in for a shock, I actually smiled and occasionally\nand it just was not funny.\nAfter a short interval Jeff Green the\nLaughter Machine (it rhymes honest) was\nback to introduce Pat Condell 'I am the\nMaster of the Universe, I am the man\nwho says Mind the Gap'. He was so\nsincere about it all you could almost\nbelieve him, but then again. He was in\nboogie A review of Freshers'\nWeek by Colin Toombs\nWEEK\nthe laughter business and after a few digs\nat the Police (someone has to do it) had\nearned his applause. Not bad at all.\nAnd so we move on to DOON. From a name like DOON I don't think anyone\ncould have anticipated the next act.\nDOON is a sexually liberated women who\nmanages to delivery the taste of what it\nwould be like if women had the mentality\nof men. She opened with a rap totally\ntaking the piss out of male chau veni st rap\nartists. She then enlightens us about using\nvibrators at the bus stop. 'Guaranteed to\nmake you come before the bus does'. Her\nact is very clever and full of humour, but\nI cannot help thinking that some of the\naudience will probably seriously believe\nwomen are pining and waiting to get laid\nat every opportunity. Are they?\nAs usual to end the evening there was\na Joke competition. All you had to do\nwas provide a witty punchline for this\njoke. 'What did Nigel Lawson say when\nhe met Sir Eric Ash' No one entered. So\nto get rid of the four cans of Castlemaine\nXXXX a stand-up joke competition was\nrun.\nThe Americans entered in full force, but\nwe had a Yorkshire lad to keep up the\nBritish end. The result was a tie between\nCalifornia and Yorkshire and was a splendid climax to a good evening's entertainment.\nAfter another night spent recovering it\nwas the Final event of the week, the\nFreshers' Ball. With a whole list of things\nhappening through the night there was\nno excuse for boredom.\nThe lights were still there in full\nglorious tech nicol our. A new Links\ncocktail bar with a new drinks list. A closer look found this to be purely\ncosmetic and they were in fact of the\nsame composition.\nMy Tropical Trauma in hand it was off\nto see the first band of the night: Boy Girl\nSoup (more of a Boy Soup as there are\nno girls in the band). I would class them\nas pop rock, playing a few love songs\nand a handful of meaningful ones. The\nvolume was too loud as the sound was\ndistorting, but they w re nothing special.\nNext up was the Trudy. The\npsychedelic lights began to swirl and an\nextract from the first episode of Lost in\nSpace hummed out the speakers. The\nTrudy are lost in that late seventies\nperiod of drainpipes and science fiction,\nwhen similar bands like the Revillos were\naround. The Trudy, however, are living\non in the Nineties with loads of silly\nsongs about outer space. The lead singer,\nMelissa, has a dance style which would\nhave been considered na ff at Disco\nAmnesia '90 but got s loads of people\ndancing (until some prat s started moshi ng and stage diving). To put it simply they\nwere brilliant.\nDeath Bang Party. Who ever put this\nband together I take my hat off to you.\nThey were amazingly mind blowing. With\nno fewer than nine people on stage at\nany one time providing the music the\natmosphere was ecstatic, positively\norgasmic. A costume change was required\nby the high priest of the cult of Death\nBang for most songs with 101 ludicrous\nstage props. The songs had highly\nrepeatable choruses so everyone could\njoin in, with 'Where's the party? The\nparty's up your arse' and 'Fuck, Fuck,\nFuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck You!' being some\nof the tamer ones. The absurdity of the\nshow rose to astonishing heights: starting\noff wearing massive bull horns on his\nhead, the high priest stripped to a loin\ncloth, complete with phallic vacuum\ncleaner hose (industrial size) attacked,\nthen it was into a swimsuit and rubber\ndingy, and ending up in the cult of Death\nBang ceremonial cloak and wig.\nEveryone in the Lounge was on their\nknees to the almighty Death Bang. I escaped quickly before I too was\nconverted. I now knew the answer to\nBJ Says Thanks Thanks to all of you who turned up to\nthe events in Freshers' Week, I hope you\nall had a good time. If you have any\ncomments or suggestions about anything\nto do with the events no matter how\ngood or bad, please let us know by either\ndropping a note into the Ents pigeonhole\nin the Union Office or, if you recognise\nany of us, by telling us personally.\nIt is important as we are here to\norganise events for you so if you don't tell us what you want we will assume you\nlike what we like. Even (especially) if you\nliked it tell us!!\nThe next Ents event is not until\nOctober 26 when two up and coming\nbands will be grooving on down in the\nLounge.\nThey are Spirit of Ecstacy and Miss\nAmerica (see FELIX for preview). Details\nfor this and the event the following week,\nThe Muscle Shoal and support, will\nappear in FELIX nearer the time.\nBut the Ents disco raves on! On\n'When's the Party?' it was in the Union\nlounge.\nC&G were running a Casino with Black\nJack, Farmers Glory and Roulette being\nplayed. The first prize for the person with\nthe highest winnings is a personal stereo.\nSince I lost all my chips on a chaotic\ngame of roulette I have not won.\nThe head ling ing band of the night was\nThe James Taylor Quartet and all the\nguests they could think of inviting. The\nmusic conjures up images of Starsky and\nHutch and Hawaii 50. I did not\nappreciate it. However, I was reliably\ninformed by a non-biased watcher that\nthey were good. From the number of\npeople dancing I will believe him. And so\nthe only fun week of a whole year at\nImperial College slipped into the past as\nthe sun rose.\nI enjoyed myself and I'm hard to\nplease. My only gripe (as usual) is against\nthe disco's music. That aside, Rave on\nHacienda Boys!\nFREE DISCO EVER/ WEDNESDAY\nIN THE UNION LOUNGE\nWednesday and every Wednesday Libido\nwill be raging in the Lounge from\n8pm12 ish. The top Ents DJ's will be\npumping out the latest and greatest in all\ntypes of music from House music to\nHeads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes music.\nIt's great, and free, so come along and\nshake it out.\nAlso there are Ents meetings every\nTuesday to talk about world problems\nand world solutions\u2014if you want to get a head, get involved\u2014the rewards are\nendless. Also Ents card holders (or non-holders); some still have not been\ncollected, come into the Union Office\nanytime or Ents meetings on Tuesday\nl pm in the Lounge to pick them up.\nIf you still want one come into the\nUnion Office, ask for the Ents crew and\nshout 'Poulet-f rites' while shaking your\nbody frantically. Also you will need \u00a37\nand a photo. Bye for now.\nBJ.\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS\nClubs & Socs\nAmnesty\nInternational\nThe week of 15-21 October is Amnesty\nInternational Prisoner of Conscience\nWeek. A prisoner of conscience (or POC)\nis defined by Amnesty as being someone\nwho is imprisoned on account of their\npolitical or religious beliefs, or their race,\ncolour or sex, who have not used nore\nadvocated the use of violence. The\nadopted prisoner of the Imperial College\nAmnesty Group is Alaattin Sahin, a Turkish chemical engineer.'\nDuring the 1970s a large number of\npolitical groups and parties were formed\nin Turkey. Following the military coup of\nSeptember 1980, all political groups and\nthe publications associated with them\nwere banned. Their editors and journalists\nwere arrested and tried because of\narticles they had written or published\nquite legally at that time.\nAlaattin Sahin is one of these\njournalists. He was arrested on 26 May\n1980. In 1977 he had been the editor-in-chief of a journal called 'Hallein Yolu'\n(People's Way). He was charged with\nmaking communist pro pog and a, insulting\nthe authorities and inciting to crime. He\nreceived sentences totally more 130\nyears' imprisonment. These were\ncombined to the maximum possible\nsentence of 36 years\u2014the equivalent to\nlife imprisonment.\nAmnesty International knows of no\nevidence that Alaattin Sahin used or\nadvocated violence. He is, therefore,\nconsidered to be a prisoner of con cie n ce imprisoned in violation of his right to\nfree de om of expression as set out in\nArticle 10 of the European Convention on\nHuman Rights to which Turkey is a state\nparty.\nThe Amensty group at IC regularly\nwrites letters and campaigns for the\nrelease of Alaattin Sahin. To find out\nmore about the work of Amnesty,\ninternationally or at IC come along to our\nfirst meeting on Tuesday 16 October in\nthe Clubs, Committee Room (top floor\nUnion Building) at 5.30pm. We will be\nshowing an introductory video.\nUROP\nshall hopefully act as a catalyst to greater\nthings to come. The last few summers\nhave mostly been a case of my tre king around employment agencies to find that\nthere is no job available for me. When I was at school, it was the college students\nwho had priority, but when I entered\ncollege, somehow the school students\nwere taking my job.\nThus, last autumn I vowed to do\nsomething different. Most of us have\nheard of the Undergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme, UROP\u2014a scheme which I admire for giving\nopportunities to students to participate in\nthe research being done in the college.\nThere is a joint UROP summer\nprogramme with Delaware University,\nUSA, which is fully paid and a great\nopportunity for anyone. I got myself on\nthis scheme, only to hear about a similar\nscheme at MIT\u2014this time unpaid and\nmainly a case of a UROP office at MIT\nmaking room and time for an Imperial\nstudent. This idea enthralled me\u2014doing\nresearch work at the top technological\nestablishment in the world. So I wrote a few letters, made a few long distance\nphone calls and voila!! I was accepted to\ndo work at the Center for Space\nResearch, there. So off I went.\nThings were not cheap in Boston, but\nbeing a student gave me experience in\nhandling this problem. Only the food\nthere is a lot worse! The research that I was doing was in a relaxed atmosphere,\nwith a lot of team enthusiasm being\ngenerated. For example, every Tuesday\nevening we all went out and played\nsoftball\u2014a game termed as 'the old man's version of baseball'. I was not pressured\nby my supervisor, mainly because the\nproject I was doing required a lot of\nreferrals to him, and he was much more\nbusy than I was. So while I was there, I got interested in the work being done at\nHarvard Business School which is only\ntwo miles away from MIT. I decided that\nI would like to broaden my horizon, and\nmaximise the usefulness of the trip. So\nafter a bit of newspaper reading, I found\na topic which I was interested in\u2014Europe\n1992! Then made a few phone calls and\nfound a professor who had time to\naccommodate me. My professor did not\nact as a supervisor as such, but more like\nThe summer of 1990 proved to be a very\nunique experience for me and one that\na guide. He would tell me what he was\nlooking for in the report and I would go\nout and spend time myself compiling the\nrelevant information. The result was a report on the British Non-Life Insurance\nIndustry, and a lot of experience.\nThe opportunity for anyone to make\ntheir summer as interesting as mine is\nopen to anyone. I was actually at MIT\nwith two other Imperial students. Both\nthese students apparently had an\nexcellent time and one of them (Miss\nAgoropoulou, Biochemistry), who is\nworking in the Biology department there,\nhas been invited back there to do further\nresearch work, next summer. If there are\nany students who are interested in\nworking for MIT for a summer (remember\nno salary or expenses must be assumed,\nalthough things might change by next\nyear!!), go to the UROP office (Mech Eng\n313), copy the relevant pages in the MIT\nUROP booklet, and then write letters,\nwith CVs, to everyone. And then wait.\nGood luck! And it is worth noting that\nthis opportunity is not restricted to MIT\nonly.

The\nbiggest, at least in size, is the marquee\nwhich has been erected on the Queen's Lawn. The tent has been brought in to\nallow all the companies who attend the\nfair to be housed in one area, making it\nfar simpler for you to see them all.\nWe have tried to make the fair as\nprofessional as possible this year, the rest\nis up to you. Go out and convince the\ncompanies that Imperial College\ngraduates are the best in the business and\nwill be an asset to any firm they apply to.\nThe majority of companies, this year,\nwill be staying for both days, enabling\nyou to investigate them more fully. It is\nworth seeing as many companies as\npossible on day one, and then selecting\nthose with most merit for further\ndiscussion on day two.\nYour approach to companies is all\nimportant\u2014too much arrogance or\ntimidity will do you little good. Also, a balance needs to be found between calm\nconfidence and willingness to please. The\ncareers' advisory service will be more\nthan happy to help you with any\nquestions you have about techniques.\nBasically, the Careers' Fair is a service\nfor both you and the companies. A fair\namount of work has been put into it,\nmaybe more than ever before. For it to\nbe a complete success, it needs your help.\nUse it wisely, use it well and get yourself\na job!\nOK. Serious bit over, now for the nitty\ngritty. First, the reasons you should\nattend:\n1. I 'll be very upset if you don't.2. If you don't go you won't get a job.\n3. If you do go you'll get a fab and\ngroovy presentation pack (actually\nreally nice ask spunky Ben Turner).\n4. The frogs have eaten all the cheese.\nThe fair starts at 9.30am on Tuesday and\ngoes on all day, and does the same on\nWednesday. Try not to all go at\nlunchtime otherwise the tent will get\nsmelly and you possibly won't see all the\npeople. This is a chance to get a job and\ncock a snoot at all the other pid d ly little\nfairs that go on at other inferior colleges.\nUm, I'm not sure what to say now,\nmust be overwork.

    "content": "ICESC\nImperial College European Sailing\nChallenge (ICESC), the syndicate from the\nIC Yacht Club which took part in the Spi\nDauphine Challenge last Easter, is back,\nand is now in full charge of the IC Yacht\nClub, and aiming to make it a race\norientated club.\nThe club is starting off the season by\ntaking part in the Hamble Winter Series\non a hired First Class Europe from\nBenetteau. The races will be held for\neight consecutive Sundays starting on\nOctober 14. We will be practicing on\nSaturdays and will give everyone a chance to enjoy the thrill of racing.\nFor those of our members who have\nnever sailed before, we will take you out\nthe weekend of 20 and 21 October, if you\nare interested, please contact one of the\nmembers of the committee ASAP.\nCruises will be organised later during\nthe term.\nIf you want to join us, contact one of\nthe members of the committee. The IC\nYacht Club will be have having a meeting\non Friday 11 October at 12.30pm in the\nHuxley Building, room 413. All members\nplease attend, if possible.\nHang Gliding\nFirstly, I must apologise for the absence\nof the hang gliding stand from the\nFreshers' Fair, I am sure one or two\npeople must have noticed. Consequently\nthere has been no chance for me to\npersuade prospective hang gliders to sign\nup, until this.\nPrevious chairmen have started by\nattempting to compare hang gliding with\nother past times, but there is little point.\nMost people can imagine what it's like.\nI am also trying to start a para pen te section, which is becoming an\nincreasingly popular sport. Parapentes are\nthe garish square parachutes that you see\nfloating up and down the Alps, it is quite\nbig with French skiers who are bored\nwith Black slopes.\nNow for the rather tedious business of\ncost. Both hang gliding and para pen ting have to be taught by a qualified\ninstructor. This is done by 'Freeflight\nHang Gliding', also known as Eddy, who\nis based on the South Downs, just outside\nBrighton. I am going to phone him some\ntime and negotiate a discount, but the\nfollowing is a rough guide.\n\u00a315 BHGA membership (including third\nparty insurance for the fence you fly\ninto).\n\u00a335 per day for Eddy's beer money.\n\u00a36 per day for train travel to Brighton\nand back.\nIf there is enough interest we can take\na minibus, reducing the travel cost. There\nis a40% subsidy that can be reclaimed\nfrom the Union for all of these expenses.\n1 cannot guarantee when you will get a licence, but something like five days may\nget you the first stage, slightly less for the\npara p enters. If you need further persuasion or\nreassurance, or if you are already\nconverted, then please come along to a meeting. These will be held upstairs in\nSouthside bar at 12.30pm on Friday\nlunchtime. Otherwise write to me, Simon\nCole, via the Mech Eng pigeonholes.\nMicro\nThis is just a little note to inform all the\nbudding computer w izz adz out there that\nMicro Club exists again. Like the beautiful\nphoenix in that wonderful BBC tv kiddies\nprogramme, we have once again risen\nfrom the ashes and are back in (serious)\nbusiness.\nAnd now for the news: at the end of\nlast term we managed to prize an Amiga\n500 out of the RCC together with a monitor, extra half meg of ram and a few\nbits of software. The atari is still going\nstrong (though the mouse is completely in\nthe toilet! Any budding spark ies are more\nthan welcome to come and take a look).\nSecondly, Micro Club is going to be a lot better this year. I am completely fed\nup with the shoddy manner in which it\nhas been run in previous years and\nintend to pick it up off its bottom and\nreally do something useful with it. There\nwill be proper club meetings at which\nmembers can come and put forward their\nviews and ideas on how they think the\nclub should be run and what else the club\nneeds. At present, I am the chairman,\nacting secretary, acting treasurer and\nacting publicity officer and being a busy\nthird year, I would more than welcome a few hands to aid me in the running of\nMicro Club. Consequently, once there are\nenough members, 1 will hold elections for\nall the posts. Remember, if you're not a member, you can't vote or stand so come\nalong on Wednesday afternoon at 1.15pm and sign over your hard earned cash.\nIf you are interested in computers for\nwhatever reason please come and join\nup. If you already have a computer,\nespecially one of those that we already\nown, you'd be mad not to join.\nTo find us, climb the Union stairs and\nturn left. Follow the corridor round past\nSTOIC and the Ham radio society and\nyou'll see the sign directing you to us.\nSnooker\nThe 1990 Freshers' Tournament was won\non Sunday by David Johnstone in rip-roaring final. The competition attracted\nfewer entrants than recent years, mainly\ndue to poor publicity. The champion won\nthe princely sum of \u00a312 and a trophy yet\nto be presented.\nStudents should note that signing up at\nthe Union fair does not make them\nmembers or entitle them to play int he\nclub. A \u00a34 membership fee must be paid\nto receive a membership card. You can\njoin by bringing your money any\nlunchtime to the club (top floor Union\nBuilding).\nThe Club will be holding the November\nOpen into which any member can enter.\nWatch the walkway and your pigeonholes\nfor details.\nTable Tennis\nAnybody who is interested in playing\ntable-tennis come along and join the club\non Wednesday afternoon (1.30pm) on the\ntop floor of the Union Building through\nthe Snooker room.\nMembership fee is \u00a34. Further\ninformation can be obtained from the\nClub noticeboard in the club room itself.\nEquipment is supplied for members.\n15\n\n"

In addition the bookstore's policy is to refund money on faulty goods\nonly thus I was not entitled to a refund.\nHaving noted the bookstore's concern\nover students needing to make their\nmoney last (FELIX No 876).

IC is quite clear that Shan feels\nquite at home with us at Mary's, although\nwhether I'm happy at being introduced\nby him as a 'Fat F**k' is less certain (but\nwhat else would you expect from a second-hand car salesman).\nShan is particularly popular with the\nfirst year students at Mary's, especially\nwith two people neither of which have Y Chromosomes. Indeed, Mr Shanley took\ngreat pleasure in waking me up at\n3.00am on Tuesday morning with a young, innocent Mary's first year girl on\nhis arm. My chance to reciprocate, Shan,\nwill come soon.\nI write such facts not purely for gossip's sake (as if that is not a good enough\nreason), but to show that the relations\nbetween Mary's and IC continue to\nbecome closer (perhaps too close, Shan?).\nLong may the friendships continue.\nSimon G Smith,\nPresident SMHMSSU.\nRoyal College of Science Association\nCAREERS FORUM\n6.30pm, Tuesday 16th October\nSenior Common Room\nSherfield\nAn ideal opportunity to meet people from\na broad spectrum of the industrial,\ncommer ical and managerial world, able to\noffer objective advice regarding jobs,\ncareers and prospects in your particular\nfield.\nAn informal buffet supper will be served at\na cost of \u00a32.50 and a cash bar will be\navailable.\nBookings should be made at the Old\nStudents' Association Office, Room 303,\nS her field. Offence\nor Defence?\nDear Sir,\nWhy are the finest minds that Britain\nhas to offer so apathetic to subjects such\nas the Gulf? Doesn't it worry people that\nIraq has walked into a defenceless\ncountry?\nWhat I find particularly amusing is the\nattitude of the left-wing parties that\nKuwait is a rich state that hoard es its\nwealth. Ha! Kuwait has no taxes, free\neducation, free health service, in fact it is\na perfect welfare state. Iraq, on the other\nhand receives about the same income (in\n$ of oil per capita) and chooses to spend\nits money, not for the good of the people,\nbut on arms, developing nuclear\nweaponry, chemical weaponry, fighting\nlengthy wars, and killing people,\nincluding its own.\nSurely we need to encourage countries\nto spend more on civilian development? If\nwe do not defend Kuwait now, we are\nforcing countries which would otherwise\npursue social programmes to arm up to\ndefend itself. It is up to us, the developed\nnations, to intervene to make an example\nout of Iraq.\nTo this end I would propose stealth\nattacks, nuclear if necessary, on ALL\nmilitary targets in Iraq. Oil facilities\nshould be secured by conventional troops,\nand the oil used to pay the UN member\nstates for the cost of .invading, and for\nwar reparations to Kuwait. If Iraq uses\nchemical weapons we should have no\nhesitation in retaliating with nuclear\nweapons. One might argue that the Iraqi\ncitizens are innocent, but as long as they\nchoose to be led by a manipulating\nreligion they are as guilty as their\ncriminal leader. Anyone who kills for the\nabstract idea of God does not deserve to\nlive. As for the threat of a human shield,\nit must be ignored. It is simply a matter\nof terrorism. We do not give in to the\nIRA, the US did not give in when the\nTWA jet was hijacked, we must not give\nin now that a whole country has been\nhijacked.\nAthena.\nPARTY!\nevery Thursday night.\nCome along for free wine\nand the inside story.

    "content": "Guilds' Victory| \u00a7 f The diploma of the Association of the\nCity and Guilds London Institute, a qualification that only City and Guilds\n(C&G) graduates from Imperial College\nreceive, is now safe from being bestowed\nupon non-IC people.\nThe C&G London Institute had\nproposed to award the qualification to\npeople who didn't have to be engineering\ngraduates because of pressure to expand\ntheir influence into senior awards. There\nhad been much opposition to this from\nmembers of the college past and present,\nwho thought this would detract from the\nvalue of the qualification.\nLast years C&G union president, Chris\nHome, had campaigned against the\nproposal, collecting 1300 signatures from\nthe RCS and the C&G unions which were\npresented to the C&G London Institute\nduring the third term last year. He also\nwrote to fellows of the Institute and to\nthe Prime Minister.\nThe Institute stepped down over the\naffair, and a new qualification, the 'GCGI'\nor 'Graduate of the City and Guilds\nInstitute' will be conferred on non- IC\npeople.\nFire Risk Fire broke out in Weeks Hall last Friday\nwhen a wall heater burst into flames at\nabout 1.30am. The fire was fought by two\nresidents on the sixth floor with a fire-blanket and an extinguisher. A large\namount of smoke was produced which\nspread into the corridor but did not\ntrigger any smoke alarm.\nOne of the fire fighters attempted to\nsmother the four foot flames with a wet\ntowel which eventually caught fire itself.\nThe fire was defeated, leaving the room\ncovered in black soot. One of the\nresidents told Felix that he experienced\nchest pains from the acrid smoke for\nseveral hours.\nWeeks Hall bought 70 fan heaters\nbecause of problems with the central\nheating. Michael Bluck, the sub-warden\nfor Weeks Hall, said that the heating\nsystem was 'old and not satisfactory' and\nthat residents had complained of being\ntoo cold.\nThe fan heaters are placed high up on\nthe walls, but residents still use them to\ndry wet clothing. The sub-warden said\nthat this could lead to a build up of fibres\nso the heaters have to be cleaned\nregularly. He added that this should not\nbe a problem in the future now that free\ndriers are available.\nA resident of Weeks hall told Felix that\nsome of the heaters had 'temperamental\nthermostats' and that residents often left\nthe heaters on accidentally. He said that\nthe smoke alarms had not been activated\nbecause they were behind a closed door,\nin the kitchen. The alarms have been\ntested since the fire. The faulty heater\nwas removed on Saturday and is still\nunder investigation.\nMichael Bluck commented that 'Now\nand again one is going to conk out' and\nadded that he had a fan heater in his\nown room.\nObituary:\nThomas Junker\nThe tragic death of Thomas Junker, a student from Aachen in\nGermany, has deeply shocked friends. He died on the\nWednesday before last in a car crash in Chiswick. Thomas had\ncome to the country last February on an exchange to do his\nfinal year project in I.C.'s Chemical Engineering department. He\nwas 26.\nFriends said 'everybody that met him found him a warm,\nfriendly and charming person. He will be sorely missed'. The\nfuneral will be held in Germany.

Bodies imprisoned in\ntaught rubber were stilled and the first\nband came on.\nCristabelle Children wear black.\nCristabelle Children have lots of hair.\nCristabelle Children put quotes from the\nBible on their lyric sheets. Cristabelle\nChildren don't play soppy music. What\nthey do give is a hair-raising turmoil of\nsounds and deranged experiences. The\nbodies seethed and the rubber ed flesh got\nfunny little drops of condensation on\nthem.\nSister Midnight have spent the last few\nmonths building up an in shatter able reputation for k inkiness and general onstage perversions. Anyone who had come\nto see contouring body-stockings and\nblack leather whips was not disappointed.\nAnyone who had come to listen to the\nmusic had been mobbed out long ago.\nShockingly, Sister Midnight itself used to\nbe a blok e, but was now part way\nthrough that operation which entails the\nremoval of certain unmentionable and\nir rep la cable parts (bollocks\u2014Ed). It\nseemed quite happy to display this fact to\nus all by wearing a leopard-skin body-stocking and flaunting his lack of tackle,\nparticularly in the direction of any\n11111111\nHail Ave Demntia Marionettes\navailable camera lens. The photographer\nis now in a stable condition and out of\nintensive care.\nIn an especially subdued mood for this\nrefined gig, they refrained from whipping\neach other on stage and contented\nthemselves merely with gyrating PVC-clad\nfemales who were not as well clad as\nsome of the barer embers of the\naudience. No disappointment was the\nsound, a ranch y, kinky, rocky perversion,\nably captured on their debut EP. When\nall was silent once more, the beasts were\nagain rounded up into their cases.\nRosetta Stone are being hailed as the\nsart of a Goth revival\u2014help us!! They\nunashamedly carry on where the Sisters\nof Mercy and The Mission left off years\nago to become commercialised. They are\nan astounding two-piece, completed with\nDarkness and Light: Rosetta Stone\nthe compulsory ill-named drum-machine.\nWhat makes them still more remarkable\nis th t the talented intricate guitarist can\ngive a most refined and tuneful vocal at\nthe same time. This was flourished with\nanother imaginative bassist. The b latent rip-offs of entire musical lines from such\nclassics as Walk Away and almost every\ndecent Mish piece just added to their\nappeal. Firmly distanced from the\nritual ler s by a sheath of dry ice, those\nwho did not suffocate and managed to\npeer through the gloom and racing laser\neffects will have seen a chilling ly emotional performance, yet beautifully\ncomposed and still, in extreme contrast to\nthe insane mayhem of dancing and\nbewitched circles spinning wildly to the\nincantation. The pair vanished briefly\nfrom the stage, only to be drawled back\nto complete the experience.\nStill ravenous to complete this musical\nfix, the Ave Dementia (previously\nScreaming) Marionettes. Easily the biggest\nband there, they release their debut\nalbum Ave Dementia, next week and are\nabout to undertake a major tour of the\nUK, finishing at the London Astoria. They\ndrained every bit of energy and sweat\nfrom the rabid crowd, some of whom\nwere near collapse after Like Cristabelle,\ntheir second single. They've come far\nsince Obsession, developing melody and\nanger as they blast minds and today.\nBodies flew from the stage and still\nremained elevated on the excitement.\nAnd then they were gone, and the\nGoths skulked back to their chambers,\nnow fired on a renewed hope of a day\nwhen they would dare show their faces in\nthe light again, and be able to buy Sisters\nof Mercy records without being laughed\nat.\nSJH.\n\n"

    "content": "Birdland Rock 'n' Roll Nigger EP\nBirdland get back to their original roots\non this four track EP. The infinitely slow\nintro heralds an obviously outrageously\nfast track with all the usual vigour and\nspeed. Fans who thought that they'd lost\n'the edge' with the relative tranquility of\nSleep With Me will already be back\nslamming in their beds its. At last, they\nhave got half-way to ensnaring their\nprecocious live mania to disc.\nThe shame of its controversy over the\nword 'nigger' (which they gloating ly and\ntea singly relish over) is the song's coup.\nBirdland always set out to be\nnonconformist. Thats why we love them,\nalong with vivacious liveliness and\nexhilarating sound.\nWhen you've c ought you're breath,\nProtection over the back begins with\nmore gently rocking harmonics and gives\nthe collapsing listener a chance to\nrecover a little with his feet just on the\nground. The slower tempo does not do\nwonders for his voice which tends better\ntowards impromptu scrawl than holding a melody. But this is what Birdland are\nthere for\nAll too soon, Rollercoaster swoops in to\ndestroy any club venue. Similarly to the\nMary Chain's Rollercoaster in principle\nbut not performance, some phrases are\nalmost Arabian and the drumming is\nflawlessly accurate, making the near\ntuneless vocals even more gratifying. As\never, Birdland look at life, and get on\nwith what they're good at - having a great time.\nThe flip climaxes with Fun Fun Fun\nwhich leaves you dying to turn the\nrecord over back to the lead track again.\nThis is Birdland at their most typical\u2014\nrecklessly young, frivolously jolly and\naggressively noisy. It's a track for anyone\nfed up with moping lyricists mourning\nbroken relationships. Birdland get straight\non with live and to the full. Have fun\nwhile you're young; and when you're old\ntoo, and Birdland don't get any\nprofounder than that. Call them\noutspoken.\nCall them young and foolish. But if this\nis what comes out of it, that must be\ngood. All together, Birdland prove that\ndiversity is still posible without sacrificing\noriginality, ideals and a downright\ncockiness.\nSJH\nBlur I Know Single\nOh dear, in / Know we have yet more\nbaggy music. Hammond organ, sixties\ngroove, boyish voice (and no doubt-blow y haircuts)\u2014sounds suspiciously\nCnar/a fan esque. Having heard nothing by\nthis band before, we were expecting better\nthings. At a guess this is the band's dance\nchart attempt, but they're obviously\nreluctant to sell out completely and this\n'indie'-c is ive ness has left them with a rather drab sound.\nOn to the other side with She's So\nHigh. Top intro with very Spaceman 3\ngroovy noises in the background. It\nmoves on with an unexciting vocal\nmelody and poor lyrics (she's so high,\nshe's so high\u2014I want to crawl all over\nher, etc\u2014honestly!!!). What's more, it's very repetitive and as this isn'ta dance\nrecord, they've got no excuse. She's So\nHigh does, however, have a redeeming\nmiddle eight hippy sitar-like bit.\nDespite this, Blur are talented musicians\nand this record is well produced. With a tad more originality they could do well.\nSee Blur at ULU on November 11\u2014we'll\nbe there.\nPinky & Perky\nPrefab Sprout Jordan LP\nI question record companies motives for\nstarting albums with tracks that have\nbeen released as singles. Along with the\ninevitable 'featuring the hit singles it is\nall an attempt to sell copies to the bopp y chart market. Prefab Sprout don't need\nany of these gimmicks as they have\nproduced what may be their best album\nyet.\nOn the first hearing many of the songs\nsound similar, gentle ditties that will\noffend nobody. But, on the second play a whole new world opens up, full of\nsurprises and inspiration.\nThe sequencing is perfect, each track\nflows neatly and sensibly on to create a well rounded whole (this is one CD I won't put on random play.) Saying that,\nany of the songs could hold its own,\nexcept 'All boys believe anything' as its\nonly half a minute long.\nExcellent value with nineteen tracks\nand well over an hour long.\nIn the words of one of their own song,\n'any music worth its salt is good for\ndancing.'\nIan Hodge\n\n"
