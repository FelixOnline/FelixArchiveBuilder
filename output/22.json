    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THE QUAD.\n\u2022 J ir Mr. Frank Drake's letter published in your last issue has done much to lift up the hearts of those who love the beauty of the English Garden.\nThe Quad, is an eyesore and the garbage heap\nof the devil, especially when covered with white and crawling worms, of tennis, netball or even\nbowls players. Let us have a garden, f filed with flowers, old English flowers of the cottage 'garden beside small lawns and sheltered arbour s, where the tedious hours may be passed blissfully away en rapt in the bouquet\nof perfume and lulled by the symphony of the bees. Lect this be deemed impracticable, I suggest that the tennis courts and other athletic paraphernalia be transferred to the grass bare and uninspiring waste ground opposite the Union gates. Yours faithfully, Umfaan.\n10th May, 1951.\nSir Your correspondent, Frank Drake, has an\namusing, if perverse, sense of humour. He has\nprovided us with yet another topic of discussion\nwhich will be the cause of much enjoyment for weeks to come. I refer to the now established\ncase of Tennis Courts (\"Nine Points of t the Law\")\nv. Bowling Green (\"Castles in the Air\"). While applauding the general tone of Drake's letter, I must point out that he is\" all at e \u00bba\" with some of his remarks.\nThe membership of the tennis club is about\n180 (hence more than \"minor sectional interests\" are involved) - a precise figure cannot be given\nbecause, with the disturbing \"war\" news, subscriptions are being received at the rate of 300 (ty p ing error) a day'. This is but one example of\nthe feeling of the members (potential ef other-wise) with regard to the suggested \"tearing up\nof the courts and the substituting of a Crown\ngreen\".\nThen, again, Drake hopes to get to the bottom of the netball problem by doing away with the\ntennis courts but he may s be sure that it is just\nas easy to play the game on a bowling green as\non a tennis court j As to the \"rusty iron netting\", would Drake\nprefer to have nothing to support him after his sessions in the Bar?\nYours faithfully, \"Double Fault\" (I.C. Union).\n10th May, 1951 \u2022\n..Lr - Your readers must have witnessed, last Thur s day week, the extraordinary spectacle of decrepit \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nad be whiskered old gentlemen( nay - I \"cannot call them that) violating the hallowed precincts of the College centre court, with a lamentably ineffective iV u it it ion of 'how to bowl a marble'. \u2022.Vhile congratulating the very probationary I. C.1ow li rig Club on their gallant efforts in aid of the doo ervin c T.B. appeal, I suggest that before they can hope to enhance the dignity and sporting re put \u2022l; ioa of the College to deserve a green of its own,\nM. ey should give some attention to the learning of t 'he line arts of bowling on some far distant green, i'e rl. 'tps their' Distinguished Old Boer' could give thorn ol.a ying facilities in South Africa. Yours faithfully, Jack Wool (I.C. Union). DANCE k SOCIAL SAT. JUNE8 T\",3/ Tickets, in advance only, from Felix Office\nTHE BAR\n10th Bfey,1951.\nSir As one who was early called to the bar and\nwho has been an active member of the small circle of its regular supporters. ever since, I feel it is time that the growing dissatisfaction in this happy\ncircle be brought to the notice of less social but more hungry members of the Union. The situation has been brought to a head by alteration in i. he\nmanagement of the Refefc'tory, the possibility of a return to the former Club gatherings on Saturday nights, a favourable Budget anc1a Brewers' threat( Id on beer). The position is that the eai ers in the Union are indebted to the drinkers to the extent of some\nthousands of pounds. presumably this subsidy will no long jer be paid to the new catering firm, who are not running the bar. Thus the debt could be repaid by three methods: the nationalisation of the bar to ensure an annual loss, the redistribution of profits on the Co-op. system, or the reduction of prices. Kindh.ear ted n. ess ( as well a js work) being the curse of the drinking classes, we do not press the- suggestion that the time is ripe for the enters to subsidize the drinkers, but would be content if the bar were\nreorganized on a nonprofit making basis, or with small profits spent on improving the equipment and\nfacilities of the bar.

The examples\n( exo er pts from Smetana'u \"The Bartered Bride\") were\nex cd l lent ly performed, Jean Woods as Marenka being outstanding. As this was s the best entertainment offered to I.C. for along time, it was a great pity that so few from our college bothered to. attend.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nTRIUMPH FOR R.C.S. On May 10th, after a dull morning, the sun broke through the grey clouds making, even the rust on the netting around the tennis courts glisten. The scene was set, the bowlers braced and the green grassed for the Imperial College Bowling Club Annual Inter College. Match for the 'Plymouth' Challenge Cup. ( Better known as the' All Bowls Do'.\nBefore the match commenced Derek Cooatber presented the college teams to the High Commission aire for South Africa Feste Vail of Trans a jarom in ent figure in full mourning dress. The High Commission aire then conferred the supreme honour on the club of ' blocking off on the newly opened green. The teams, fortifying themselves liberally.' be tween 'ends' with luncheon from both plates and\npots, gave an extremely agile performance of bowls 'as she. is burlesqued'.* The R.C.S., showing the better bowl control of the three teams, drew steadily ahead to' win by5 clear points from C.&G., with R.S. M. whose fitting headgear may have biased their aim - a gallant third. The event was brought to a close by the presentation of the^\"CuP to the winning team by Feste, who-then delivered himself of a short by impassioned speech in a mixture of basic English and afrikaans f* The club is pleased to announce that the amount\ncollected during the match and the I.C. General Meeting which followed will ensure that the T.B. site will be provided with a first class bowling green even if other funds are not sufficient for a sanatorium. F.D.* See handbook 'Bowls for the Boys' published by the Armada Press.* \u2022 The English version ofF este's speech can be had\non application to S. Africa House ( supplied in plain envelopes, price6d). ATHLETICS The high standard of athletics in the College is shown by the fact that6 members have been representing the University regularly, and 5 occasionally. As a result the college team has rarely been at full strength but in spite of this and atrocious weather in most of the matches, results h age been fairly good.\nThe first match, v. South London Haulers, we\nwon comfortably, Wil i mer running a fine quarter mile in52.2 sec. Blackheath Harriers then defeated us narrowly, and King's repeated this more dec-is iv ely on S at.5 th May, when 11 of pur men were at Oxford with the University teams. On Wednesday\n9th May with a team.of only13, we drew with L.S. S,, the score being brought tp4343 by the last event, the s or in t relay, which I.C. won easily. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 5 - \" ''j f. li.W.\"\"<v\" \u2022\nCRICKET At Hastings on Whit-Saturday the sun shone,\nthe sky was blue, and I.C. lost the toss. This\nwas the ominous prelude to 45 minutes' cricket\nduring which East Sussex scored 80 runs before\nthe first wicket fell. That is not to say that\nit should not fallen before, but the fielding, with one or two honourable exceptions, was poor,\nand the bowling not too tidy. Then Wilson (4-50) and Ault (2-37) found a length, and in another 70 minutes the oppositions were all out for133. Lappin took 2-11 and\nReynols was ill-rewarded with 1-33.\nAfter tea I.C. began unfortunately. Clapp\ns nicked one to the w ioke t keeper In-the first over, and Wyles was foolishly run out. A stand\nbetween Oldland and Waterland (30), in spite of\nsome comical running between wickets, saved the\nInnings from ignominy. Some;sturdy hitting by\nRambaut promoted it to affluence, and when the\ncaptain left for28 the score was in the nineties. Serem and Oldland had taken it to over 120 before\nthe latter was caught for an excellent 40. Several wickets then fell pre el j at at ely, and the\nadvent of Rowly Reynolds did not inspire all excess of optimism among I.C. supporters. However\nthis worthy warrior smote an un exp eot ed four,and\na so ampere d leg-bye brought victory with 2 w ioke ts and five minutes to spare, As the Duke of Wellington said it was a damned close run thing.\n0>:\nAN EPIC SQUASH MATCH On March 14th, the final of the White ley\nCup tournament was played between Jeff Kenyon\n(holder 1948, 49, 50) and Arthur Wright, Kenyon\nwinning 6-9, 0-9, 10r8,108,97. Wright had\nonly been beaten once since coming to I.C. this year, and had beaten Kenhon 3-1 in the inter college match at Christmas.\nFrom the start the game was played at a terrific pace, Wright using ail his speed and accurate\ndriving to put Kenyon off his drop shots. He\nwon the first two games, the second in a single\nhand, and went ahead to 8-3, lana tch point , in the third game. However, Kenyon found his touch\nand fought back tooth and nail to win the game\n10-8. In the fourth game Wright again v; ent ahead\nto match point 8-5, but once more Kenyon found a streak of brilliance and won at 10-8.\nThe fifth game found both men exhausted,but\nwith no letting up in the pace - Kenyon appeared\nto keep going by will power alone. The score\nwent evenly to 7 - all when after several blank\nhands, Kenyon finally won at 9-7,\nGreat credit must go to Kenyon 'for his terrific fighting recovery, and for sticking to his\nbes.i type of game in spite of the pace. Wright\nplayed with his usual speed and determination,\nand must be considered very unfortunate not to\nhave won in the third or fourth games. The\nmatch Has played in an admirable spirit, both\nmen having impeccable court manners, and provided the spectators with the most thrilling exhibition of high class squash that has been\nseen here for years.\nLAWN TENNIS The opening of the Lawn Tennis season, wh i oh seems now doomed to be the hast, has been success-ful. One match, played in a lighthearted vacation spirit, was lost, but the remainder have been\nwon. The most important was the win over St.\nBart's Hospital by 9-0, which carried I.C. through\nthe preliminary round ofthe U.L. Cup. The 7-2\nwin at New College, Oxford was also notable; I.C. were without Wright as he had been picked to play\nfor Surrey, for wh i oh we should like to take this opportunity of congratulating him.\nThe most interesting mato h of the season has\nbeen the Inter-College match between R.C.S. and\nC.&G., played on the college courts on Sunday,May\n6th. Guilds started favourites and won 3 or the\n4 singles rub her s.* The long-awaited match between\nWright and Spenoe-Bate was somewhat disappointing\nas both men seemed to wait for each other's mistakes rather than go for the winning shots which\nthe tea-time oro wd was expecting.\nThe three doubles matches provided the tension for wh i oh hostel dwellers were waiting, and\nwhich, I must venture to add, I feel the bowling\nclub will rarely be able to provide. Your scribe\nand hi B partner, after some extraordinarily bad\nplay, lost their rubber to a virile R.C.S. third pair; and Wright and partner appeared determined\nto do the same thing. The result of the mato h depended upon whether Smith and Ward of Guilds\ncould beat Watson and Spence-Bate of R.C.S. who\nwon gamely, continuing despite a sprained ankle.\nAfter a hectic struggle every point being cheered\nby rival groups among the spectators, the ill dsp air triumphed, thus winning the mato h43.B. J.S. BOWING On Saturday, 12th. May, in glorious sunshine\nand with a north-westerly breeze, I.O. B.C. were\nrepresented in the U.L. B.O. Allom Oup Regatta by\nthe 2nd. Junior Eight rowing in the Clinker Division. Drawn against U.0.&H.,1.0. had a somewhat scratchy row and U.C. going away at the\nstart drew slowly ahead to win by 3 lengths.\nMeanwhile, the 1st. Eight had spent the\nmorning having an outing with Leander. After the reorganisation following the Head, the Eight\nis settling down and shaping quite well. If full advantage is taken of the outings with\nLeander to s it bao k at the finish whilst the\nhands go away, and the ore woon tl nu e to Improve,\nit should prove a difficult or ew to beat in the\nThames Oup.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX S STRAIGHT FROM THE HALSEY' S MOUTH In an interview Mr. Halsey, Chairman of the Entertainments Committee, made the following statement:\n\"The Entertaiment s Committee is elected annually to ' organise such entertainment and functions as the Imperial College Union Council may require.' Its members, therefore, when standing for election, go into the job with their eyes open, and as a result strongly resent any imputation that they adv is ed the stopping of the 'Hops' because they were\n' tired of running them.' To combat the over-crowd-ing the first emergency measure, taken at the first two dances of the term, was to restrict the admission of women to200, only personal guests of I.C. members being allowed in once that total had been\nreached. The dropping off of the numbers of women\nallowed us to discontinue this unpopular measure.\nAn attempt to ensure that men from other colleges were not coming uni vite d to the Union was made, by\nchecking Union cards at t ne main entrance, but Union members were not cooperative, and the attempt\nwas discontinued. The check was transferred to the\nentrance to the dance, and was fairly successful, though certain gentlemen of the Union seemed most\ntrusting in their policy of introducing strangers as their 'guests.'\nAfter complaints from Union members attention then turned to the social standard of the ladies at the dances, \u201end the Committee suitably altered the lighting in the Upper Dining Hall and kept a careful eye on the Visitors' Book. Unfortunately it is rather difficult to dispute the point with a lady, whatever her accent or make-up, when she gives a college as her alma mater. It is also difficult, at a point in the middle of the term, to in form \u2022 one college that its members are no longer welcome,\nwhen others are still admitted. With this, and many\nother reasons in mind, the Entertainments Committee\nresolved to recommend to Council that the Saturday\nnight 'Hops', in the sense defined by short lived tradition, should be discontinued. It has been asked why we have not put forward any\nalternative plans.!' e considered that a term was\nnecessary to dissuade the unwanted from trying to batter down the gates of I.C. For next year, it is not within our province to decide t ne policy of a Co uci l and Committee yet to be elected, tn ough we\nhave suggestions we shall not hesitate to put for ward. These, in essence, areas follows:( a) I.C. Union members able to introduce one guest to the dance on production of a Union card,( b) Sufficient invitation cards be sent v.ee k ly to a few Women'.s Colleges to remedy the social deficiencies of I.C.(c) No other persons to be admitted to the dances.\nBy these means we hope for a return to the old friendly party atmosphere of the first two years of 'Hops.'\nKe would welcome comment on these suggestions, and they should be addressed to the Hon. Sec, in tert a in ra ents, NOT to the Editor of Felix.\" DRINKING CONCERT\n\"The a.C.S. smoking? Why they' ll be drinking next!\" So rana derisive comment from a Guildsman\nbefore the event. After it, those privileged Guildsmen and Miners who were guests revised their opinions. Yes, the R.C.S. Smoking Concert on 1 st May was probably the most successful event this year. The informal atmosphere, the free beer and\nthe really excellent cabaret all contributed to a hilarious evening. Nohody present will ever forget the pure fantasy of Ken Bock as Bing Crosby, supported by the three lovely Andrews Sisters. We also had Derek ( Killer) Hughes disguised as to lle. Duval of the Folies Bergere dispensing kisses as prizes in an auction for the T.B. fund. And the Little Nellie melodrama\nat the end had all the characteristics of a Dram.\nSoc. ^.ines Night. Our congratulations and thanks\nto our Entertainments Committee, and to Peter Hask ell for his professional comp e ring.

    "content": "FELIX PROFILE:\" DAI\" The leaders of Union life in I.C. cannot be said to conform to rigid types. We have known Honorary\nSecretaries to be hardworking, unobtrusive and\nquietly likeable or mildly lazy, obtrusive and\ngently pleasant but never have we seen one quite\nlike Dai Nicholas, gruff, aggressive, provocative but somehow likeable. Dai is a man who knows what\nhe thinks about things and speaks his mind. With his thickset build, black hair and dark rounded\nchin, the look he casts with his piercing black eyes through thick glasses is enough to disquiet the boldest critic. He has a manner which command w attention, even if in some it promotes dislike. However.those who come to know him find that the\nbluff exterior conceals a simple man of earnest and honest ende stv our. Seldom have national characteristics been so\nin evidence in one of our Union officials. Born\nin the depths of South Wales and brought up\nthrough the heavy years of depression among coal miners with a grievance, he appears, at the age of32, to be fired with a tremendous vigour for bulldozing his way through life, with an unshakeable\ndislike for all things sav our ing of Communism,and\nan equally unshakeable enthusiasm for Rugby football. Having sniffed a tI.C. life for a year in1938, he left to Join the Desert Rats in their long journey from Egypt to Austria, where he found\nneither Communism nor Rugby, but many delightful Frau le in s whose attentions he thanks for his succ ess in German in his finals, when he failed in French and was unable to receive his degree I Dai made his presence felt early in Union meetings, with his fervent', if unpolished, attacks on N.U.S. activities. He is a man more confident than most of his own decisions and, although willing to hear other opinions, is4 e term in ed to carry\nhis own decisions through. Dai says that we. as members of a large and powerful college, can do\nmuch to improve the University Union setup. Thus\nit can be seen that he holds strong opinions about student affairs; and despite his anti Left pronouncements in a Union with considerable Left wing membership, he was elected Hon. Sec. of R.C.S. Union two years ago.\nSince his election to I.C.U. office, Dai has thrown his weight about to some purpose. His voice and influence have been heard and felt concerning the leading issues of ICWA, Hops and University participation. Concerning reciprocal Union mem-ber ship, Dai has strong opinions and is characteristically not afraid to dissent from those of his President. Of course, this reflects only the more serious side of the Hon. Secretary. He has no unusual hu man failings, naturally takes an active part in the social life of the College, and, as one of our\neligible bachelors he regards career women with suspicion feeling that they would be better educated in the humanities than science.

His success\nin this direction was demonstrated during a dinner he gave, at which he was presented with an in s cri bed cigarette box, in appreciation of his work.\nHe wished also publicly to acknowledge the\nestablishment of three Rock feller bursa riesa tI.C. and the provision of financial aid enabling a postgraduate course in Public Health Engineering to be started a tI.e., due to the efforts of\nProf. Gordon Fair, Prof, of Engineering at Harvard,\nwhom the Rector formally admitted to honorary fellowship of Imperial College. Academically the Rector aimed to refresh his mind by sampling the American aims aid ideals of education, particularly in respect of both the for mal and informal educational links between the\nliberal arts and science and the links between\nteaching and research in the departments of pure\nscience and engineering. It seems that at postgraduate level there is more cooperation between\nthese departments than there is in this country. He was also curious to see how the training rec ei ved at University helped in the use of the knowledge acquired. Finally Sir Rod eric wished to renew some personal friendships and, by discussion, to discover what the Americans think about our common problems.\nAlthough the Rector took every opportunity to decimate ideas an the work of I.C., he treated his visit primarily as a social one. Five days were\nspent living in a students' hostel or \" dormitory\" at M.I.T. where he mixed aid talked freely with the\nstudents, eating with them in their cafeteria and\nattending their committee meetings as a friendly observer. It.seems that the American universities are suffering, as we are, from a serious overcrowding since the war, with the result that the links between staff and students, and.indeed.between ,the\nstudents themselves, have become somewhat attenuated. However, the Rector found that there exists among the students a great enthusiasm and zest for life, and all with whom he came in contact most\ncordial and friendly. Sir Rod eric wishes to emphasize the great pleasure that he had in maki ng this trip. Both he and the President of M.I.T hope that whenever possible we shall have tempor-ar ilyin our midst atleast one member of the\nstaff of M.I.T., while a member of I.C. staff will be working at the Institute, or \"Tech.\"as\nit is known, in Cambridge, Mass.\nYET ANOTHER U.L. CUP\nThe Chess- Club1 st team, with an unbeaten record, won the Sir George Thomas CuP av.ard ed to the winners of the 1st division of the University of London Chess League. This is the third time in the Jjast five years that the cup has been held by I.C. In the2 nd division, I.C. is at present leading, and appears likely to finish top. For the\nfirst time\" in the Club's history a third team was\nformed, which won all l its matches.\nNine'members have played for the University during the season, of whom J.C. Cook (R.C.S., Capt.\nUn iv. team) was awarded a Full Purple, T.N.C et inhale( C.&G.) Half Purple and R.H. Dugdale (C.&G) Team Purple. In recognition of the achievements of the Club, a pot has been installed in the bar for the use of the Captain. Record: Matches played:17; won:15; lost:2. MINES ELECTIONS On Tuesday March 1 3 thR. S.M. Union officers for the Session195152 were elected, before the\nfourth year miners migrated south to Cornwall. Not unexpectedly, David Griffiths was ele c ted President having made a very popular and\nefficient secretary during the preceding year. John White was elected vicepresident of the\nUnion a position he should fill most adequately, with many years of serious drinking behind him, as\nwell as one very successful rug ger season during which he was Secretary of the Mines' R.F.C. and\nCao tain of the I.C.'A'. The onerous post of Secretary was filled by\nan uncomplaining Bill Robinson, who, as Captain of U.L. R.F.C. next year, will find his time fully occupied. Trouble over a game of bowls Whilst the E.B. A. has been insulted by the\nFestival Organisers by the laying of asphalt In st ead of a green, ( Evening Standard, 11th May) the\nImperial College Bowling Club goes from strength to strength. The annual inter College match for the 'Plymouth' Cup was played off on Thursday 10th May. A full report appears on the Sports page.\nAs a result of the enthusiastic support a mot-ion passed at the Union meeting the same day set up a committee to enquire into the replacement of\nthe present tennis courts by a green.\nNEW SQUASH PRESIDENT We are pleased to be able to announce that R.B.R. Wilson has accepted the invitation to become\nPresident of the I.C. Squash Rackets Club for the\nseason195152. Roy Wilson is, one of the leading amateurs in the country, playing no. 1 for England and Surrey. Last year he was narrowly defeated in the Amateur\nChampionship by the holder, and later distinguished himself in the Open Championship by beating the\nprofessional runner up, only to be beaten in the\nsemifinal by the hoi der. He was at City and Gui lds from194043, obtaining a2nd in Mechanical Engi nee ring, and visited the Club last term to play exhibition matches against Kenyon and Wright. \u2022 H. BAR PRICES At the Refectory Committee meeting of 8 th May\nit was decided that in suite of the Id per pint increase recently made by the brewers, the Union Bar prices will remain as at present( draught mild1/3, bitter1/5, per pint).

This, the original cost price of reproducing our\nfortnightly howler, is, we feel, the reasonable charge for a students' paper. The refusal on our part to allow our three penny FELIX to be oom e more expensive will result in a \u00a32 loss per issue. Wishing to remain independent, both in fi nance and in outlook, we have not asked Council for a subsidy, but prefer to work our own passage.\nIn order to raise the necessary money we are holding a \"FELIX Social\" on the evening of Saturday, June 9 th, which will be rather a eh so tlc affair probably including a film show, a treasure hunt,\nand a dance. Tickets price3/ will be on sale obtainable only in advance from the FELIX Office( latterly known as the library annex). ARCHITECTURE AND THE FESTIVAL HALL By an unfortunate accident the notice given in the last FELIX of the Intercollegiate Committee's symposium on \"The Festival Hall\" omitted to say that the talking would be followed by a buffet, beer, dancing and what-have-you. This probably accounts for the fact that only half a dozen I.C. members\nturned up. This was a pity, for in the design of the Hall science, music and art were equally involved. The speakers Br. Leslie Martin( architect), Mr. Allen( Building Research Station) and Dr. Step hens ( R.C.S.), who were each responsible for various features of the Hall's design, and Mr. Mann, music\ncritic of the Times - showed the extent and success of this collaboration. It should be noted that this was the first of a series of symposia to beheld on. architectural subjects. Medal: \"We came to the conclusion, on the advice of our acoustical experts, that acoustics is not yet an' exact science\".( Dr. Leslie Martin} Not on lu Comncif 3 i# as veil\nf if o he the date fl\u00a3iq e<V fRio ny OCTOnly 39 College Jays a& ay\nENTRANCE HALL CONQUERED On the 2 7 th April the peace of the Union was\nshattered by the activities of the IttC. Mountaineering Club. Having been suitably primed the President of the Club did a traverse of the Union entrance hall, the first time that this has been\ncompleted. He then returned to the bar. Meanwhile other members of the Club tried, three of whom succeeded, Mr. Keenly side, a representative of the Climbers Club, meeting his Waterloo Just before the Squash Club notices. These festivities took place after the Club's Annual Dinner at which Lord Chorley was the principal guest. Before the dinner Prof. tt.I. Finch gave a nao count of an attempt on Everest in which he took part, and illustrated his talk with some excellent slides. The members completed the evening's activities by inspecting one or two climbs up the front of the\nUnion. ELECT ION MAN SHIP\nI've been elected the President of the Ludo Club. It was like this. I was at the \"Bag o1 Noires\"\nlast Saturday; v. hen in came Kick and the boys from the Dominoe Club, and after a few rounds we got to talking about the shocking state of beer and how it was going up in price and Nick said he knew a blok e, see, what would sell it cheap to clubs, at the old price, but that of course it was not for him, not being on the committee, to say anything. And so we\ngot to talking about the committee and the way they hadn't done anything but passed our money over for a good skin ful at the Virgin's Arms, and this ought\nto stop. So George said that if Nick were president he could get cheaper beer and spend the club money\nhere on us. Course this did not interest me as\nI 've nothing to do with the Domino Club, so when\nGeorge said well, I'll propose you and Umf. would\nyou care to put your of course, I passed my glass. And when it was empty again they thanked me for my\nsupport and showed me where to sign. I said it was all a mistake and that I thought but they said a gentleman's word once given and so an and that they would propose me for President of the Ludo Club .\nOf course I said that I was not going to be pre sid n nt but if my name was put up I would not cross it off. Which they did, and they went about telling everyone\nwhat a good sort I waa, and I was free with the beers and how I had helped them in their Club and all sorts2> flies, that everyone thought I was a good sort and made me president nem. con. .\nBUSMAN S HOLI DAY.\nPart of the Festival is virtually on oar doorstep, and FELIX recently passed the austere gaze of Newton, Darwin and Rutherford, and entered the Science Exhibition to find out just what all this Sci en ce is about.\nThe designers have tackled the vast problem of presenting a comprehensive survey of modern thought in Science in a most ingenious manner. The method\nused is to lead, the visitor progressively from the sub microscopic to the macroscopic, beginning with the construction of simple atoms. The grouping of atoms to form more and more complex molecules eventually leads, through organic compounds, to the structure of living matter, and the processes of life. Thus the fields of Physics, Chemistry and\nBiology are linked in a way which expresses that unification and simplification which itself is one\nof the outstanding achievements of this century. Incidental attractions include the Electronic Brain which challenges all comers ( with invariable success) at the game of NIK, and the mechanical Tortoises, which we could have played with for hours. J. C.M.T. SKI-ING IN NORWAY The first expedition of I.C. Ski Club, toM jj z fl f jell in Norway was a great success, and the 8\nmembers who saved up, packed textbooks into their suitcases and endured a gruelling North Be a crossing, were fully rewarded by the10 days' stay at the hostel. Only one member of then art v had skip fl before, but the. excellence of the instruction enabled everyone to pass the first star test( one passed the second star) before leading. There were no serious injuries, in spite of the many collisions between skiers travelling at up to30 m.p.h., and stationary birch trees, rocks and\nsnow-banks- The only maladies encountered were seasickness and sunstroke, which gives a good indication of the weather exo erie n ced on the journey and at Hj cAf jell. In all, the expedition was first class, both as a skiing course and as a holiday. N.
