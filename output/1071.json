    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2Q TH NOVEMBER COLUMNS & THE WEEKLY POEM 11\nTabloid Journalists. It is generally\nfelt that such word smiths are not the\nmost wholesome characters, being\ncategorised neatly between traffic\nwardens and Paul Daniels. They\npounce on a story with scant attention to the facts. Wouldn't happen\nhere, would it. Ah, well yes and no.\nYou may recall, and it seems half\nof Sherfield do, my mention of dubious work practices in the Student\nFees Office, where check-mate takes\npriority over cheques, mate.\nUnfortunately, there isn'ta Student\nFees Office, but there is a Student\nFinance Office, which contains,\namong others, the perfectly named\nbut unrelated Shirley Baker. She was\nunderstandably anxious about this\nambiguity, so let me apologise profusely and clarify the issue. The\nCollege Expenses Office (room 410)\nwas the place to which I was refer-ring, and I stand by the thrust of my\npoint. Such behaviour is unacceptable and should be dealt with accord-ingly. Why chess is needed on\nSherfield's computers is a fascinating question, one which will hopefully be answered in due course. The\nStudent Finance Office is totally\nblameless, has never committed any\nmis demean our to my knowledge,\nand is staffed by Imperial's finest. If\nyou see me begging in South Ken\nsubway at the\ntime of the next\ngrant cheque,\nyou will know that\nthis apology has\nnot been accepted.\nSpeaking of\nSherfield, I noticed\nthat my esteemed\nbut sadly anonymous brother in\narms Don, writing\nin the house journal IC Distorter,\nmentioned the\n' cleaned' Biochemistry\nSimon Baker\nJ \u00a3 Voice of Reason\nif like those in neighbouring\nChemistry, never leaked, have been\ntotally re sealed, and the stonework\nhas been both cleaned and stained in\nan operation that has cost thousands.\nAlthough the money, I believe, was\nfrom an external source, surely it\ncould have been used a little more\nsensibly. But given the signs debacle,\nthis is more sensible. As for Campus\nRenaissance, I 'll freely admit that\nthings are going\nvery well, with\nthe BMS rising\nmajestically. Keep\nit up, the effort\nthat is, and the\nbuilding of course.\nAs predicted the\nstrike took place\nacross the country\na week last\nTuesday. My sympathies go out to\nthose brave souls\non the picket line\nwho must have\nfrozen to death,\nbut I did feel\nsomewhat doubtful about the strike, hence my\nreason for breaking it. No one can\nsensibly argue that academics are\nadequately paid, particularly when\none sees an advert in the Evening\noffering \u00a320,000. The reasons for the\nrelative diminution of their pay is a complex economic issue, but the\noverwhelming fact is that groups do\nnot curry favour with a Conservative\ngovernment by taking industrial\naction. Nor does Joe Public feel compelled to speak out in support when\nthe affected group is one of the least\nliked in society, namely students.\nHowever, on the assumption that all\nuniversities are, like IC, run according to the teachings of the British\nLeyland School of Management, it\nshould be possible to free up\nresources to fund a larger pay claim\nfor this deserving group. Finally,\nmany people think that I am a tad\nunfair about the beer in Da Vinci's and the Union Bar, comparing it very\nun favourably with 'the other place.'\nSo last Friday, I decided to check this\nout once and for all. Some very\nextensive research was undertaken,\nand I can confirm that the\nWorthingtons, Brakespear and\nTetley should not be consumed under\nany circumstances. You have been\nwarned.\nStandard for council handy persons The NHS has been experiencing\nmany problems of late, culminating\nwith this month's budget deficits. I was surprised at how this was reported in the media. A patient was left\nout on the road for six hours waiting\nfor treatment, as there were no doctors available to treat them. The NHS\nobviously does not have enough\nmoney to handle all patients. The\nignorance here which is constantly\npresented on national as well as\nregional news is that we somehow\ndo not pay for our health service.\nThe Government initiatives of\ndecentralisation, (cutting costs of\npatient care), care in the community,\n(dispensing with expensive psych i Has anybody noticed that.,, money. People may want to take out\nprivate medical insurance, but considering how much it costs, wouldn't it be better if our taxes paid for a better NHSfor everybody, not just those\nwho can pay? I am all for value for\nmoney, but only if initiatives are\nmanaged well and the Government\non its present track record appears to\nbe unable to achieve this.\nBasic Bupa cover costs \u00a3108 a year. For an average earner of!\n\u00a315000, this is equivalent to almost;\nan extra penny on the basic rate of\nincome tax.

When an article\nat ric hospitals), all \"I am all for value for appears on the\nhave a primarily money in the NHS, but the news putting the\neconomic objective Government appears to be\nsupported with a unable to achieve this.\"\nweak ideology. All the Government\ninitiatives so far have been in order\nto save money - our money. This is\nfair enough. The problem comes\nwhen, on reduction of a hospitals\nbudget, you expect them to find savings that will match this. Some\nenlightened hospitals will get the\nmanagement consultants in, but\ninevitably you will experience either\na drop in the quality of patient care or\nan overspend. John Major has agreed\nthat the NHS will need half a billion\nnext year to balance its books. We\nmay well be paying less for our\nNHS, but we shouldn't expect to\nreceive the same service for our\nNHS in a bad light,\nit is presented that\nthey do not have enough money, not\nthat the Government - and therefore\nus - are under funding it.\nWhen you next hear how NHS\ncuts caused so-and-so, think about\nwho finally pays the bill for it. The\nelection is coming, and once again\nthe Tories will offer lower taxes\nThis is all they can offer - they have\nno moral high ground or good man\nage ment. When crime rises, insurance goes up. When hospital standards drop, people are forced to get\nprivate health care.

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 2 9 TH NOVEMBER News in Brief\nSecurity resorts to dogs\nVAS KORBA SAK As a result of the one-day strike last\nweek, a temporary reduction in the\nie vel of security occurred within the\nImperial College estate, necessitating\ncontract guards and dogs for site\npatrols. Despite a skeleton crew covering the twelve absent staff, the\nextra men were drafted in to make up\nnumbers.\nAlthough contract security staff\nwere hired they only replaced three\nof the twelve absentees. This was\npartly due to the security staffs' trade\nunion regulations, as there are limitations on the number of temporary\nstaff that can be hired at one time.\nThere has also been some controversy about whether the temporary staff\nwere justified in bringing three dogs\nto assist with security operations.\nKeith Reynolds, Head of Security\nand Fire at IC, who made the request\nto bring in the dogs, said that they\nwere mainly there to protect the\n2,000 residents in Prince's Gardens.\nDue to IC regulations, the temporary security guards were not permitted to carry swipe cards. This has\ncaused concern among residents that\ntheir safety would have been jeo pardi sed in the event of a fire or bur-gla ry. Swipe cards are only issued to\npeople employed for longer than\nthree months, although a special\nallowance was made and they were\ngiven them before the end of the\nduty. This was particularly awkward\nwhen a bar alarm was set off at\nPrinces' Gardens, which was mistaken for a fire alarm. The proper security staff took\nturns to go on duty during the night\nshift in order to ensure that there was\nalways some level of security\nthroughout the strike. According to\nKen Weir, Head of Security at IC,\nthe main role of the contract security\nstaff was for \"perimeter control\" and\n\"a minimal security presence\" was\nkept during the strike.\nTalking to Felix, Keith Reynolds\nsaid that the two main aims during\nthe strike were to have adequate\nsecurity to be prepared for emergencies such as fire, and to protect the\nresidents. He said that in a short time\nit was needed to \"put something in\nplace without inflaming the situ a tion.\" since the ICU and the administration office only responded to the\nsituation at the last minute.\nCRIME ON CAMPUS A man has admitted to over 60\ncrimes on the Imperial College campus after being questioned in a joint\ninvestigation being conducted by the\nBelgravia Police and IC Security.\nThree men were arrested and\nbrought in for questioning in connection with 200 crimes in the local area\nand it was only when one of the three\ndecided to confess that IC Security\nwere brought in to help.\nMost of the crimes committed on\ncampus, since the beginning of 1995\nwere walk-in burglaries, where the\nguilty party told police that he was let\ninto Southside and Beit halls of residence by students. Stolen items\nranged from cash and walkman s to\nmore expensive items, mobile\nphones and, in one particularly successful mission, a laptop computer.\nSecurity have been unable to\nlocate 48 of the crimes in their report\nfiles, perhaps because many of them\ncould be described as minor and so\nare not reported.Ken Weir, Head of\nSecurity at IC, is interested in any\ninformation regarding the investigation and wishes to remind students to\nlock their doors and to check the\nidentity of people they don't recognise entering the halls.\nRCSU RESIGNATIONS\nThe Royal College of Science Union\nreceived a double whammy recently,\nwith the resignation of both the\nHonorary Junior Treasurer and the\nHonorary Senior Treasurer.\nDr Ann Mitchell, HST for several\nyears, is to be employed on a part-time \"contract\" basis from the beginning of the new year. According to\nthe RCSU constitution, these terms\ndisqualify her from holding the postion of HST, leaving her very little\nchoice but to resign.\nChris Bragg, HJT from 1994-1996, resigned after tiring of people\nwho failed to follow Imperial\nCollege Union financial procedure.\nHe intends to use the time to concentrate on his final year project. The\nUnion president, Mo Dulloo, agrees\nwith Mr Bragg that \"there are people\nwho are quite 'clueless' about financial policy, no matter how much they\nare told about it...this flippant noncompliance of regulations has put\nincreasing pressure on Chris.\"\nThe position of HJT will temporarily be taken over by Honorary\nSecretary Rob Park, additional to his\ncurrent responsibilities within the\nUnion.\nCLUSTER'S LAST STAND European space scientists have\nlaunched a bid to resurrect the failed\nCluster satellite mission, destroyed\nin the disaster o us explosion of the\nAriane V rocket last June (Felix\n1060).\nBritish scientists must secure \u00a37\nmillion towards a second mission\nwhich, it is hoped, could be rebuilt\nfor less than a third of the cost of the\noriginal.\nIf given the go-ahead, 'Cluster IF\nwill employ four identical probes to\nexamine interactions between the\nearth's magnetic field and the Solar\nwind, and carry instruments designed\nand built by a team led by Imperial\nCollege physicists. A decision from\nthe European Space Agency is\nexpected this week.\nSTUDENT LOAN DEBTS\nTO BE PRIVATISED\nThe key feature of the Budget this\nTuesday was a penny cut in Income\nTax, which the Chancellor has\npromised for next year. To finance\nthis benevolent scheme he has been\nforced to look for money elsewhere.\nOne of the major sources of cash is\nplanned to be the sale of student debt\nwhich is expected to raise \u00a33 billion\nfor the exchequer. As the Chancellor\nput it, \"it makes no sense for the\nGovernment to keep a huge portfolio\nof loans on its books when the private sector could manage it more\neffectively and is better placed with\nthe risk.\" He went on to assure that\nthe sale would have no effect upon\nthe terms on which student loans are\ngranted, though he gave no guarantee\nthat this situation would continue\nafter subsequent Budgets.\nIn effect, this amounts to the virtual privatisation of student loans, from\nnow on students will not owe money\nto the state, but instead they will owe\nit a private, profit making company.\nThis would suggest that either the\nrules governing the repayment of\nloans will be tightened up to make\nthe whole system more profitable,\nwhich Kenneth Clarke has promised\nwill not happen, or that the government will face problems in selling off\nthe system, as it did when it first tried to privat is e the scheme five years ago\nwhen it was forced to change it's plans as none of the major banks\nshowed any interest in the venture.\nEither way, students are unlikely to\nbenefit, as from the \u00a33 billion raised,\nonly 7% has been set aside for uni-vers i ties.

The\nIndian New Year and the Diwali festival celebrations occur in November and it is for this reason a few of the London College organise 'Diwali\nShows' - cultural explorations of India. IC has\nnever had this annual tradition and so kicking off\nan initial event was an even harder task.\nThe evening itself saw various fashion shows,\ndances (from East and West), comedy speeches\nand singing acts. After months of hard work and\ndedication, the show was performed on Tuesday\n19th November to a700 strong audience in the\nGreat Hall.\nThe show was a joint production with Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical School. The cast\nof performers comprised of individuals from that\ncollege as well as Imperial. Even though the event\nhad no tradition or reputation from previous years\n(unlike other 'Diwali shows'), the event was a complete sell out at quite an early stage. Much\neffort was put into the event to bill it as one of the\nbest, if not the best. The reaction, remarks and\nfeedback from all those involved and all those who\nwatched was exactly what the organiser had hoped\nfor...that yes, it was the best cultural show they\nhad ever seen. Attendance from other colleges was\nhigh and feedback from them was similar and\nencouraging.\nThe event had a number of highlights that will\nbe remembered by all. The first half saw a superb\ncomedy sketch called 'The P Files\" (the Patel\nFiles). It was about how a cult group of Patels trying to take over the remaining Caucasian corner-shops. The cult group was led by a 'Don' Patel(acted superbly by an Aku Patel), and directly\nBelow: Traditional dancing celebrating Diwali.\ncomplemented by Vernu. The audiences reaction\nto the two was excellent.\nThe second half of the show was the stranger\nhalf. It saw various fashion shows, one involving\nTaz (the Chippendale) getting his pecs out - this\nwent down very well - and another show involving\nprofessional models from an agency and exclusive\ndesigner clothes. In both the student models' fashion show and the professional models' one there\nwere two guys from IC. Paraag 'The Stud' Dare\nand the aforementioned Aku Patel, did well in the\nstudent ran show, but also oozed class in the company of professional models (even showing a few\nup)! Paraag, in particular was stunning and\nrumours are floating around about a possible contract with an agency.\nThe second half also saw another comedy\nsketch, 'The Fresh Prince of Bombay\", which was\nalso very popular with the audience. Will was\nplayed by Amjad and an excellent version of\nCarlton was played by Gaurav Misra. The sketch\nalso featured a brilliantly choreographed dance -Aseema - to the song \"Made in India\", the dance\nfeatured a guest appearance by Paraag (who by this\npoint, along with Aku and Gaurav, was one of the\nleading stars of the show). This half ended with an\nexcellent synchronise d dance to Rhythm Nation.\nThe two singers, Azzi (as George Michael) and Jo\n(as Michael Jackson) were also amazing.\nAfter the show, everyone hit the Senior\nCommon Room for the after show party, where\npraise was metered out to the whole cast of the per-form ance. This event bodes well for future years,\nand congratulations must go to Chetan and Akshay\nfor organising the IC side of the event.\nTop: Exclusive designer clothes modeled in the fashion show.\nLeft: Aku and Nernu in the comedy sketch 'The\nPatels'.\nWORDS: GAURAV\nPHOTOS: LILY\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2 9 TH NOVEMBER LETTERS & EDITORIAL 13\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nanswered by David Roberts\n^ EEL IX Student Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\nA time for action\nDear Felix,\nI wish to make a point about\nindustrial action in response to your\neditorial entitled Strike One. Your\nreview reported that the Government\nhas stated that there are no votes in\nHE. This cynical attitude reveals not\nonly the Government's true attitude\nto fairness in an improving economy\nbut also exposes an Achilles heel.\nThe Government is clearly dismissive of strikes and other industrial\nactions. However if the joint Trades\nUnions were to call upon those they\nrepresent to vote against a government which fails to keep incomes in\nline with inflation then it might learn\nwithin a few months that its complacency was misjudged. If this were to\nhappen then a conservative (forgive\nthe pun) estimate would place lost\ngovernment support at 100,000 votes\nin city constituencies. The realisation\nthat many MPs supporting the\nGovernment would thus suffer a100% cut in their own recently self\ninflated incomes should focus minds\nrapidly. Democratic power can justifiably encourage the Government to\nprovide the funds necessary to make\na fair settlement possible.\nAlthough the current offer of 1.5%\nis an effective pay cut of at least\n1.5% because of rising inflation, any\nindustrial action cedes the moral high\nground to the Government and\ninjures innocent parties in the\nprocess. Sensible action is effective\naction.\nName and adress withheld\nThis is indeed true, and in an idealised world the unions would\nindeed have the power to bring\ndown the Government. However,\nin this idealised world the same\nforces would have kept the present\nGovernment well away from\npower for the last seventeen years.\nThe same period has also shown\nthe fatal flaw in this dream - the\nelectorate has proved all to happy\nto sacrifice their principles and\ntheir desire for long term se curit ry, in return for a quick buck - So\nwhat as up rise it was to see unjustified tax cuts on Tuesday.\nUntil then, shows of solidarity\nsuch as last weeks strike are all we\nhave to try to press u rise this\n\"Government\" into doing what\nwe, I imagine, all believe to be\nright, namely giving more money\nto Higher Education.\nIf anyone has a better method,\nplease step forward.\nDear Felix\nAs always I enjoyed reading the\nlast issue (1070) of Felix and,\nbecause of my role in College, I was\nparticularly interested in the front\npage article about the industrial\naction of 19 November 1996.\nHowever, my confidence in its accuracy was somewhat undermined by\nthe fact that you thought you were\nspeaking to Caroline Fox when, in\nfact, I believe you spoke to me.\nOf course, you may have spoken\nto Caroline too, in which case I apologise for MY error. Nevertheless, in\nthe interests of accuracy and to spare\nthe blushes of others who may not\nwish to be associated with my com-men ts,I thought you would like to\nknow that I have been Director of\nPersonnel at the College since last\nJanuary. (Oh, I did not really say\nwhat you reported either. Perhaps it\nwasn't me after all!)\nYours - and still looking forward\nto the next issue\nMarion\nA matter of honour\nDear Simon Baker\nOn a day when the club goes into\nbattle for the honour of the College, I hope you can reach across and accept\nother peoples point of view. The\nhockey club has a long standing tradition of giving all of its members\nbar names. It is these names that you\nrefer too in your latest column. The\nclub is founded on strong social ties\nand all that, of which the bar names\ndo actually play an important part,\nyes they have a shallow surface silly\nside, but for the most part, they add a sense of pride and aid team spirit. I hope you try to appreciate this for\nwhat it is and not just automatically\nlook to ridicule it further. I am sure\nyou can resist the temptation.\nDo the right thing\nDear Felix,\nAny readers who were interested\nin last week's article on the human\nrights organisation Amnesty\nInternational may like to know about\na new group which has been meeting\nin cole ge this year. The Amnesty\nInternational group meets in\nSouthside upper lounge on\nThursdays at 12 o 'clock. At the\nmoment the group is concentrating\non sending letters or faxes regarding\nrecent violations of human rights, but\nthe range of activities may increase if\nwe can find more members - this will\nalso allow us to affiliate to the union.\nSapna Trivedi\nA VIRTUOUS BUDGET?\nSo that's that then. A penny off\nincome tax and widening of the personal allowance for all of us, a few\npence off the price of spirits and\nthr'pence on beer for the drinkers.\nThe Budget was a bit of an anticlimax given all the build up. Not much\nthere for each of us, personally, yet\nwe would seem to be better off. Are\nwe all satisfied?\nIt is interesting that is there an\nexpectation among the public that\ntaxes and excise duties will go down\nat budgets, whilst the economists\nexpect more rational measures to\n'balance the books'. Why should the\npublic expect movements in the tax\nrates always to be downward?\nThe general public and the\nGovernment have both contributed\nto the attitude of 'having one's cake\nand eating it'. The public wants a good level of services, but doesn't want to have to pay for it, and the\nGovernment responds to this by\npromising that this is possible. This\ngives us the annual round of Budget\nfudging, muddling and mis-in form a tion, where the priorities get skewed.\nIt is unfortunate that this bargaining\nbetween various streams of expend i having no votes attached. Thus when\nthe cuts were metered out this time\nround, the various interest groups\nlobbying for more money for HE\ncould claim only the 'victory' of\nobtaining a \"breathing space\" by\nhaving the cut limited to 0.5%. To\nsweeten the cut, there is to be an\nextra \u00a320 million spent on science,\nwhich, as most researchers at\nImperial will tell you, will not go\nvery far among the 100 universities\nin Britain. I would suggest that the\ncampaigning by these interest groups\nwill go on, but until the issue of\nHigher Education becomes more\nurgent, particularly in the eyes of the\npublic who mostly do not appreciate\nit's 'service' value, it will continue to\nbe ignored.\nAs an addendum, the performance\nby the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke,\non the short \"Budget Broadcast\" just\nbefore Tuesday's Newsnight, was\nquite intriguing. Throughout the talk,\nthe Chancellor extolled the virtue of\nhis Budget, telling us how he was\nplanning for the future as well as giving everyone a little something.\nHowever, he didn't mention the\nConservative Party once, not even\nwith reference to the forthcoming\nture becomes viciously political.\nWhich is where Higher Education\ncomes in.\nWe have given a lot of space in\nFelix this week to coverage of the\nBudget, and how it affects Higher\nEducation. This is because it is an\nimportant issue for this College. HE\nis, there can be no doubt, a political\nfootball; no party except the Liberal\nDemocrats are prepared to declare\nHE an important policy area. It is\nlargely ignored, assigned the value of\nelection battle with Labour. Hmmm.\nCAREERS FAIR\nOops! Sorry for not mentioning the\nCareers fair in the last issue.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 29TH NOVEMBER SPORT 15\nUL U Karate victorious in\nNationals thanks to IC students\nOn the 23rd of this month the 14 people from the University of London\n(ULU) Karate Club attended the\nKUGB student Championships held\nin Chesterfield. The KUGB is the\nlargest Karate Organisation in the\nUK and most university clubs are\naffiliated to it. The event is normally\na big occasion and attracts many university teams and students studying\nat other institutions. The quality is\nhigh and blood flows freely.\nThe ULU team are currently\nEuropean Champions, a tide which\nthey have won for two years running.\nIt is also the first uni-based team to\nwin the Southern Regional open and\ngain a seeding for the Open\nNationals, after they kicked it earlier\nthis year. The team picks up numerous trophies and titles throughout the\nyear, including at the BUSA\nNationals.\nThis is the one, however, that people fear! Physically demanding and\nvery tough, months of intensive\ntraining went into this.\nSaturday 23rd kicked off with the\nKATA events. Katas are formal\nexercises (combinations of pre-set\nmoves that have been passed on from\ngeneration to generation). Although\none of three key cornerstones of\nmodem day Karate, Godwin and Ed\nDoSantos (the IC contribution)\nneglected this event in order to stay\nfocused on the KUMl'lL or sparring.\nCaptained by T. Hughes (former\nIC) and coached by S. Hastings\n(England KUGB Squad), the team\ncame first.\nWe were quite confident in our\npool of clubs/un is but were weary of\nsome of the bigger names. We were\ncertainly glad that we didn't have to\nface the Liverpool team early on,\nwho comprise of many good fighters\nand some members of the infamous\nRed Triangle Dojo. But we had the\nManchester five which had some\ninternational fighters in their ranks.\n(Godwin had one of them and lost by\none Wazari - half point - in a very\nclose fight). London, however, triumphed by a total of three fights to\ntwo. We were fighting better and\ngaining in confidence as the day progressed thanks to some good captaincy and blasting coaching. We\nreached the semifinals, where we\ncame up against Aberystwyth. This\nteam was previously fairly unknown,\nbut we granted them the respect due\nconsidering the teams they had beaten to get there.\nWith nerves on the line everyone\nknew what was expected of them.\nGodwin had a good, clean fight with\nonly one warning against a jumping\nsweep attack followed up with a back fist. He finally won with a front\nleg sweep followed by a Kizami\nZuki -jabbing punch) to put London\nthrough to the finals.\nWe awaited news from the other\nmats and were not surprised to learn\nthat Liverpool had beaten last years\nwinners, Leeds, by 3 - 1 with one\nfight drawn. Oh well...\nIn the individual events, the\nLondon team fighters (Tony,\nGodwin, Edwin, Rami and Lewis) all\ngot off to good starts. T. Hughes was\none of the favourites having come\nthird in the Shotokan Cup two\nmonths ago. He had to beat two\nEngland fighters to get there. Rami\n(University College Hospital) is a strong and useful fighter who joined\nus from the Cambridge ranks after\ncompleting his first degree. Lewis is\nsmall but quick, agile with plenty of\nstamina. Godwin is bigger and more\npower full with deceptively deft timing and reflexes (Ed is a dancer and a beautiful one at that).\nWe were knocking out people with\nincreasing difficulty, and after each\nround we were all pleased that everyone else had stayed in. London was\nlooking good. Lewis fell first, to be\nshortly followed by John, our reserve\nfrom St George's. Then came the\nround before the quarter finals and\nthings were closing down. Ed had to\nfight Rami, as they had both been\npooled together. They knew each\nother well, having fought in training\nand sparred with one another frequently. Ed's footwork and nimbleness gave him the edge on the day\nand he was through to the quarters.\nGodwin, meanwhile, was having a good time on his mat, that is until\ndisaster struck (actually a fist).\nGodwin was up at the time and had\nall the play when his opponent\nbecame increasingly desperate. He\nlet off a right hook, knocked out G's gum shield and almost two of his\nteeth. The Midlander, was disqualified for excessive and uncontrolled\ntechniques. But there was no more\nquarter final and straight off to hospital for Godwin. Skank. If it had\nbeen in the next round, G. would\nhave been guaranteed another medal-lion... Living sk ank! Ed, however, had progressed to\nthe semi-finals. We were now guaranteed at least one of the ULU team\nin the final. Ed-son was unlucky as,\n(and I say this as an unbiased\nbystander), some of the referees were\nblind to his techniques and a majority must be confident. There was no\nshame however, as his opponent was\nalso a great fighter. Ed picked up the\nbronze, and had to re-focus his attention on the team finals. Tony Hughes\nwas a bit unfortunate in that his\nopponent in the final apparently ran\nhis face into Tony's fist. The result\nwas a crashed nose and ad is qu ali fi cation. T., therefore, picked up the\nsilver.\nG was back from hospital in time\nfor the final, which was held in the\nevening. As we now had to field our\nreserve, there was no scope for error.\nThe brunt fell on Tony, Ed-son and\nRami. Beforehand, we had four out\nof five very strong fighters. So, for\nthe team to win, one of us could\nafford to drop a fight and still come\nthrough with a32 margin. We now\ncouldn't afford such a luxury.\nEd was up first. The kid was psyched up to the max. It showed when\nhe went out there-. Earlier on, you\ncould shout, 'Ed dance', and he\nwould give you a few (Hollywood\nshuffles to keep you smiling. Now it\nwas purely business. He must have\nwon in under a minute.\nThe next two were our reserve and\nmost junior grade. We went down,\ntwice. Next up was Tony. He had a good fight and there was only one\nscary moment when it was feared\nthat he cracked the other guy too\nhard. Two each with one fight\nremaining. The man Rami had it all\nto prove.\nThe fight started tentatively with\nboth fighters moving around and\ntesting each others reflexes and fighting style. (Does he go all defensive\nwhen under attack or does he stand\nhis ground? Is he a kicker or a punch-er? Is his guard adequate or is he concentrating more on attacking you?....\nDoes he dance well?).\nThe fight went on and no points\nwere won, then crash. Rami got\ncaught at what seemed like impossible range. Half a point down the\nwhistle sounded for thirty seconds\nleft. The ULU team had stopped\nscreaming at this point and the only\nvoices you could hear were those of\nthe coach and the captain. (When\nyou're losing and under pressure\nwith the whole world to pay if you\nlose, the last thing you need is some-one, who thinks he knows what he's talking about, to start hollering at\nyou). By 20 seconds, we knew that\nR. would have to play things his own\nway. Then, quick as you like, he was\nin there to even the score with a solid\nblow to the body. Hundreds of people erupted but it could still go either\nway. We were all still sweating\nbuckets.\nThe Scouser attacked, Rami countered. Rami moved around looking\nfor an opening. He couldn't see one\nand backed off. His opponent took a chance and an attack was launched, a flurry of kicks and punches. Rami is\nvery quick (which G. learnt the hard\nway in a training session). The\nattacker was caught and swept. With\na fully open back, he was in there.\nBang, bang - twice. The referee\ncalled his judges together for consultation before deciding upon the out-come. A full-point Ippon in the dying\nseconds meant that London was now\nthe Great Britain and European\nStudent Champions.\nGodwin was a member of the\nsquad that triumphed in Europe last\nyear. There is a warm and grateful\nwelcome to Ed DoSantos who joined\nus from the IC Club, after the successful entrance of Leo Khale (for-mer IC Karate). Unfortunately, due\nto other commitments, the latter\ncould not join us on this occasion.\nWe would love to go back to\nEurope to defend our unbeaten two-year stint but ULU sports travel\ngrants are rapidly running thin. We\nwould need sponsorship to the tune\nof a few hundred pounds to finance\njust one team going out there for the\n6th8 th December. Anyone who\ncould be of assistance , please e mail\ngun.ic.ac.uk, Maths UGIII.\n\n"

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 29TH NOVEMBER\nSt Mary's research casts shadow\nover World AIDS Day\nJACKIE S KEA TE Results from an HIV testing programme at St Mary's Hospital has\nshown that Acquired Immune\nDeficiency Syndrome is fast on the\nincrease in London. With World\nAIDS Day coming up on the 1st December, this implies that the general public still need to be more\naware of the increasing risks of\ncatching AIDS.\nAt St Mary's Hospital, blood samples from patients in the accident and\nemergency unit are tested for HIV. In\n1992-1993, about 1 in 77 people tested were infected. Now, results suggest that up to 75% of people with\nHIV either do not know they have it,\nor are not declaring it\n\"There is a belief that HIV has\nplateaued out or is actually declining,\nbut our study suggests that it may be\npremature to believe this,\" warned\nMark Poznansky, an epidemiology\nspecialist at St Mary's. These results\nhighlight ongoing concerns that\ninfected blood can spill in accident\nand emergency departments, meaning that hospital workers must take\nmore precautions to avoid transmission of the disease.\nNext week, the Union will organise stands in the JCR and Union\nbuilding, giving out information\nleaflets and free condoms, and the\nproceeds from Friday's AIDS awareness party night are being donated\ntowards AIDS research.\nSpeaking about World AIDS Day,\nSarah Corneille, Deputy President\nfor Clubs and Societies, said \"There\nis still a big problem with people\nbeing generally uninformed about\nAIDS. People have phobias about it.\nIt's also difficult to educate people\nabout it without being patronising\nand talking to them as though they\nwere about six years old. Hopefully,\nall the publicity might be especially\nhelpful to people from other cultures\nwho may not be as aware about the\nvirus.\"\nLearning how to rock your vote\nNEWSTEAM\nHands up how may people have\nheard of Rock the Vote. They are a non profit-making organisation dedicated to encouraging young people to\nvote. They are themselves apolitical,\nand have the support of the three\nmajor political parties.\nThis is a major issue that needs\naddressing. The statistics show that\npeople under the age of 25 make up\n16% of the electorate, and only about\nhalf of the under 25 age group voted\nin the 1992 election. The reasons for\nthis are difficult to pin down. Young\npeople aren't all apathetic. They care\nabout current political issues. One of\nthe problems seems to be that they\nare becoming disenchanted with the\nprocess of parliamentary democracy,\nand an underlying feeling that, however they vote, it won't change anything really. Many have not bothered\nto register, partly because they may\nnot be sure how to go about it, and\npartly to avoid paying council tax.\nSince April, Rock the Vote have\nbeen distributing simplified registration cards and handing them out at\nconcert venues and nightclubs. In\nfact, today the NUS are holding a Rock the Vote club night across the\ncountry. However, having registered,\npeople then need encouragement to\nuse their vote.\nThe desire of political parties to\nwin over the younger generation has\nbeen very much in evidence. Of\ncourse the only guaranteed way to\nwin votes off anyone is to sort out\npoverty, homelessness, the NHS and\nunemployment. Having your photo\ntaken with Damon Albarn or Eddie\nIzzard wouldn't, you would think,\nmake much difference. People may\nbuy celebrity-endorsed food, but they\nwon't go for a celebrity-endorsed\ncountry.\nAs no doubt everyone knows well,\nthere has to be a General Election\nsoon, before May 29th. That means\nwe'll probably see increasing numbers of politicians making complete\nnaked arse s of themselves in public\npretending they are young and trendy\nin a desperate last-ditch attempt to\ngain votes. This is like seeing some-one's grandparents showing off at a disco - highly embarrassing and you\nhave to feel a bit sorry for them - but\nit's hundreds of times worse because\nit's on a nationwide scale.\nWhile only you can make the dec i sion, it is really in your interests to\nvote, because, like it or not, it's more\nor less the only way to get your say in\nhow the country is run. If you\nhaven't yet registered, the Labour\nSociety and Conservative Society are\njointly organising a stand in the\nUnion foyer where you can register\nyourself on the electoral roll. This\nwill be on Wednesday 4th December, from 12-2pm. If you miss\nthat, you can also register on the\ninternet at:\nhttp://www.rock the vote. org.uk/mark\n.htm. Tina Turner is 58.\nIC Nobel\nScientist dies\nAMBER SALE EM This week, many in the scientific\ncommunity mourned the death of\none of the most prominent particle\nphysicists of this century. Nobel\nPrize winner, Professor Abdus\nSalam, made significant contributions to science and education\nthroughout his career, most of which\nwas spent at Imperial College.\nBorn in 1926 in a small town in\nNorth Pakistan, Salam was educated\nat the Government College in\nLahore. He went on to study at St\nJohn's College, Cambridge where he\nlater became a lecturer and a Fellow.\nHe was appointed Head of the\nMathematics Department at Punjab\nUniversity in 1951. He left Asia in\n1957 to join Imperial College,\nfounding the Theoretical Physics\nDepartment. Until his retirement in\n1993 he was one of the most highly\nrespected and distinguished members of the Physics Department.\nSalam specialised in particle\nphysics and field theory, developing\na unified theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions. This led to\nhim being awarded the Nobel Prize\nin 1979 alongside Glashow and\nWeinburg.\nIn 1964, he founded, and became\nDirector of, the International Centre\nfor Theoretical Physics in Trieste,\nItaly, which is now has a global reputation for its research and develop-ment. Salam remained in Italy for\nseveral years working on further\nextensions of the Unification Theory\nof Fundamental Forces and super-symmetry.\nProfessor Salam played active\nroles in many worldwide organisations. He founded and became\nPresident of the Third World\nAcademy of Science, whose main\nobjectives were to encourage scientific advancements in the developing\nworld.\nIn 1988, he formed a network of\nscientific organisations concentrating on the importance of science to\ndeveloping world governments.\nProfessor Salam also had major\ninfluence as a scientific advisor to\nthe United Nations Educational\nScientific and Cultural Organisation.\nProfessor Salam made a major\nimpact on Twentieth Century science and was accredited many accolades and awards. He was well liked\nand respected by both colleagues\nand members of his community and\nwill be sorely missed by those of us\nwho were honoured enough to have\nknown him personally.\n\n"

It was greeted with relief\nby the Association of University\nTeachers.\nWith allowance for inflation, the\nlevel of funding for each student has\nfallen by 0.5% in real terms. This is\nsignificantly less than the 3% cut\nexpected by the AUT. Amidst the\ncurrent climate of expenditure cuts,\nthe Chancellor's address over pressure in funding faced by universities\nwas seen as a \"welcome novelty\".\nSpeaking to Felix, Dr Rodney\nEastwood, Director of Planning, said\nthat the additional fund did not\nrestore the cuts imposed in the last\nBudget for the current year and for\n1997-98. The Higher Education\nFunding Council for England will\nannounce their grant to Imperial\nCollege for the 97-98 session next\nMarch. It is too early to say what\nimpact this will have on College\nbefore then. However, Dr Eastwood\nwas keen to point out that the\nHEFCE had been asked by the\nSecretary of State for Education to be\nmore selective in their allocation of\nfunds for research, and that the\nCollege should do comparatively\nwell from this. The College is also\nexpected to place strong bids for the\n\u00a320 million earmarked for research\nequipment.\nFollowing the one day strike two\nweeks ago, boycotts in teaching\nquality assessment are going ahead.\nThis is the process whereby individual university departments are\nassessed and weighted by funding\ncouncils on certain criteria and this\ninvolves the universities having to\ndeal with large amounts of extra\npaperwork\nLetters have been written by the\nAUT to all university vice-chancel-lor s warning of huge scale consequences should the boycott go ahead.\nThe possibility of further action will\nbe considered in an AUT meeting\nthis Friday. Any reversal in their\ndecision to boycott will depend on\nthe outcome of the meeting of the\nvice-chancellors next Thursday.\nMembers of the AUT are angered\nby the continued refusal of the\nGovernment to review their pay.\nTheir percentage increase currently\nstands at 1.5%, far below that designated for the vice-chancellors. Their\nrefusal to negotiate with the AUT\ndoes not help to resolve this conflict.\nWith the extra funding from the\nGovernment, the AUT argues that\nthere is no reason for the vice-chan-cell or s to deny them of their just\ndemands.\nIn response to the Budget speech,\nDavid Triesman, general secretary of\nthe AUT, issued the following state-ment. \"After a period of funding starvation even a small reprieve can\nseem like nutrition. But the amounts\nneeded are not really addressed. In\nessence, we are asked to hold our\nbreadth and wait for Sir Ron\nDealing. That is a tough prescription,\neven if it could have been worse.\"\nDescribing the move as \"a change in\nthe step of decline\", he went on to\nsay \"It is imperative that the vice-chancellors seize this moment and\nopportunity to deal with staff hon-our ably.\" r Weekend: the profession\nwin jools holland tickets\non the back page.\nBudget '96: nice,\nbut...not enough\nPHOTO: ALDUS The Imperial College members of the successful University of London\nUnion Karate Team sporting the gold medals they recently gained at the\nUnited Kingdom Championships.\nThe team fought its way through the regional stages of the Karate\nUnion of Great Britain Championships before progressing to the finals at\nChesterfield.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 29TH NOVEMBER NEWS 3\nEric Forth, Tory MP: outcome of election \"deliriously uncertain\"\nKELLY ROBINSON\nFor a discussion which one might\nhave thought would be concerned\nlargely with higher education, the\ntalk by Eric Forth MP was decidedly\ncomprehensive. In fact, during his\nintroduction he admitted that, as a former Minister for Higher Education, he had already heard himself\nspeak enough about Universities.\nInstead, Mr Forth proceeded to give\nan overview of British politics today,\nor at least his own views.\nHe began by tackling the question\nof how Bill Clinton had succeeded in\nwinning a second term in office by\npersuading the American public that\ntheir country was on the economic\n\"up and up\", and that they should\nvote for him to express their gr at i tude. The Conservative Minister suggested that his party's failure to\nachieve the same feat could be attributed to the British sense of fair play,\nclaiming that the electorate was turning to Labour out of a misplaced\ndesire to \"give them a chance\".\nMr Forth's diatribe on Labour's policies, or lack thereof, continued as\nhe went on to mention their infamous u turns on issues such as unilateral disarmament, public owner-ship, and tax brackets. He said\nLabour had seen the error of their\nways, and had decided to adopt the\nvote-winning policies of the Conservatives, leaving the British public\nextremely confused with \"no clear\nblue water\" between the parties.\nIn the past, Mr Forth explained, the\nLabour Party had fought the corner\nof the oppressed while the\nConservatives guarded the interests\nof rich, 'fat-cat' businessmen. Now\nthat the mood of the Conservative\nparty is comparatively left-wing and\nthe collective mood of New Labour\ncan only be said to swing ever further\nto the right, he emphasised the difficulty the Conservatives have encountered in establishing a difference\nbetween the two. Global politics, he\nclaimed, is \"heading in the right\ndirection, in both senses of the word\"\nand while Tony Blair had somersaulted onto the bandwagon, the\nremainder of his Party still lagged\nbehind.\nThe Minister, who by his own\nadmission is happy for the Party to\nmove as far to the right as possible, is\na Thatcherite of the highest degree.\nThe economic growth and stability\nhe believes we are presently experiencing is, he said, an obvious consequence of the wise policies enforced\nduring Margaret Thatcher's rule.\nForty percent of inward investment\nin Europe is directed towards Britain,\ndemonstrating our commercial desirability in relation to the rest of the\ncontinent. Whether or not this is truly\nattributable to the 'Iron Lady' was\nleft to the individuals present to\ndecide.\nOne of the few differences the\nminister could pinpoint between the\nConservatives and Labour was on the\nissue of European union. As a former\nMEP, Mr Forth expressed his opinion that the European Parliament was\na \"damp s qui b\",a view apparently\nshared to a greater or lesser extent by\nthe rest of his party. Labour, he\nclaimed, found the whole idea much\nmore romantic, but he questioned\nhow long such a honeymoon would\nlast given previous experience.\nMr Eric Forth refused to be drawn\ninto making a prediction about the\nresult of a General Election, insisting\ninstead that whichever way the public swings, the numbers would not be\nas clear-cut as some opinion polls\nsuggest. Speaking coyly of what the\noverall outcome of such an election\nmight be, Mr Forth employed the\ncarefully-chosen words \"deliciously\nuncertain\".\nAfter his speech, Mr Forth fielded\nthe inevitable questions from an\naudience consisting largely of IC\nConservative Society members. The\nMP responded positively to the question of how he dealt with the predominantly Labour led NUS. Each\ntrade union or lobby group should be\ntreated to its own merits, he said, and\nif a request is made of the\nGovernment the group's exact nature\nshould be specified during any meeting which takes place.\nMr Forth suggested that the current political apathy amongst students might be why such a low proportion of NUS representatives are\nConservatives. Recalling the radical\nstudent politics of the past, he went\nso far as to say that had he visited IC\na few years ago he would have considered himself lucky to leave with\nhis clothes on! Finally, Mr Forth\nexpressed his hopes that the anti-Conservative lobby; conspicuous by\ntheir absence, must be busy studying\nin order to achieve the qualifications\nwhich would justify their applications for student loans.\nTHE WING CHUN BOXING ACADEMY PRESENTS\nTHE LOST WEEKEND AN UNSURPASSED AND COLOSSAL SHOW OF\nMARTIAL ARTS FEATS \u2022 THE SPECTACULAR\nPHENOMENON OF 'CHI'' WHICH DEFIES THE\nLAWS OF SCIENCE.\n- SATURDAY 7th DECEMBER 1996.\n- DOORS OPEN 7:30pm FOR 8pm START.\n- THE GREAT HALL - IMPERIAL COLLEGE.\n- TICKETS ARE LIMITED - BOOK EARLY TO SAVE\nDISAPPOINTMENT.\n- ONLY \u00a310 FOR IC STUDENTS.\nFOR TICKETS AND INFO CALL 0181-885-4126\nOR 0181-808-5232\n\n"

This\nwas soon followed up by intensive\nbible studies. At that time I had no\nreligious background and I thought\nthat religion created more problems\nthan it could solve but I was initially\nimpressed by their friendliness and\ntheir efforts to express their faith to\nme. I was eventually baptised in the\nSerpentine in Hyde Park on one cold\nNovember evening. Then came the\nheavy disciple ship and the numerous meetings that I was expected to\nattend. I was also expected to cut\ndown on my involvement in the IC\nclubs and societies. I kept questioning about this matter but I was just\ntold that \"I had a bad attitude\"\ntowards the leaders.

This scheme and the\nconcerns for my study if I tried to\nmeet every expectation of the lead-ers, put me off the church! After\nhearing how they publicly condemned other churches as being\ndemon possessed, I left the church.\nSeveral unsuccessful attempts were\nmade to bring me back, but eventually they lost interest in me as a fol-lower, and sadly as a friend as well.\n\"In retrospect, I have found the\ninitial friendliness of members of the\nCLCC rather superficial and motivated by the intention of dragging\npeople into their church and teach-ing. This cult can seriously affect\nyour personal and emotional life. A good friend of mine was doing relatively well in his degree, before his\ninvolvement in the CLCC and ended\nup failing his finals.

Although\nprices of beer, wine and hand-rolling\ntobacco are unaffected, the duty on a5% ABV pint of beer in Britain\nremains a massive 30.7p compared\nto 4.4p in France. While you're in\nCalais, you might want to pick up\nsome cigarettes, small cigars or pipe\ntobacco; the duty on these has risen\nby 3% above inflation, equivalent to\n15p on a packet of 20.\nIf this weren't enough to drive the\nnation to drink, Mr Clarke punished\ntrendy or lightweight socialites by\nraising the duty on so-called\n'alcopops' by 40%, equivalent to 8p on a small bottle, but pandered to\nhard-drinkers by cutting 4% off duty\non spirits. This is equivalent to 26p on a70 cl bottle of whisky.\nTHE PRIVATE FINANCE\nINITIATIVE\nThe PFI is a means by which the\nGovernment hopes to improve the\nefficiency of public services by using\nprivate companies to fulfil contracts\nusually undertaken by public agen-cie s. So far the PFI has funded large-scale public-sector projects, for\nexample the construction of new\npublic buildings such as hospitals.\nThe Chancellor reaffirmed the\nGovernment's commitment to PFI\nby cutting direct public spending\nfrom \u00a319.7bn to \u00a318bn this year, and\nby a further \u00a30.3bn to \u00a317.7bn by the\nyears 1999/2000.\nThis shortfall in public expenditure is expected to be more than compensated for by increases in funding\nfor the private-sector, set to rise from \u00a3l.l bn to a projected \u00a32.5bn this\nyear, and reaching \u00a34.3bn by the end\nof this century.\nAs a result of this policy, construction projects at universities will be\nHIGHER EDUCATION\nThis weeks' Budget the focus of\nmany campaigns by groups sympathetic to the plight of Higher\nEducation in Britain.
