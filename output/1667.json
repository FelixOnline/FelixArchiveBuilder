Much like an\nevil mastermind in a superhero\nmovie, Donald Trump has\nannounced to the world his evil\nplan to fuck over the planet:\nquitting the Paris Agreement. The only differences are\nthat he\u2019s as thick (but slightly more orange) as mustard,\nand that the rest of the world has gone fuck you back\nand is now probably conspiring to send him to deep\nspace, leaving behind only the faintest Cheeto-dust\ntrail as proof that he ever existed. Speaking of proof,\nComey has started testifying which is bound to be the\nbest thing to hit the screens since OJ Simpson\u2019s trial. The\nreal question now is whether Trump gets impeached\nand flees the US first, or whether California beats him\nto it and goes rogue joining China.\nThen on Saturday there were two terror attacks in\nLondon which left seven people dead, 48 people\ninjured and thousands declaring themselves safe on\nfacebook.\nBut no one probably remembers the attacks anymore\nanyway, because not only did they happen over the\nweekend when everyone was shit-faced, but we\u2019ve\nalso had to deal with the General Election, less than\na week after the London Bridge and Borough Market\nincidents. (Also this is London and we don\u2019t\u2019 have time\nto care for other people. )\nMeanwhile we have Theresa May going around\nmaking dirty confessionals, like that time she ran\nthrough a field of wheat. I mean, how can someone\nthat dirty be trusted with the leadership of a country?\nAnd that\u2019s coming from me!\nThe thing that really pisses me off about the General\nElections is that we need to get this paper to the printers\nby 11pm so there\u2019s no way in hell we can provide any\ninsightful commentary (as per usual). Unless we wing\nit. Which we did consider. A couple times. I\u2019ve just had\nthe term \u2018hung parliament\u2019 stuck in my head all week.\nLike how hung? Frankfurter hung? Beer can hung?\nBaseball bat hung?\nBack to my editorial though: Don\u2019t be too\ndisappointed we\u2019re not covering the Election results.\nJust take this opportunity to read about all the other\ndepressing shit that\u2019s happening in the world right now\nand unwind with one of out thickest editions in weeks.\nT H E\nT E A M\nAddress | felix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB || Telephone | 02075948072 || Printed by | Mortons Media\nGroup Ltd Media Centre, Morton Way, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, LN9 6JR || Registered Newspaper | ISSN 1040-0711 || Copyright\n\u00a9 felix 2016\nEditor-in-Chief | Lef Apostolakis || Deputy Editor | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || News Editor | Matt Johnston, Joanna Wormald || Comment\nEditors | Vivien Hadlow, Tessa Davey, Jonathan Masters || Culture Ringmaster | Fred Fyles || Culture Editors | Indira Mallik, Meryl Anil,\nAnurag Deshpande, Theo Farah, Simran Kukran || Puzzles Editor | Hamish Beck || Clubs & Societies Editor | Abigail de Bruin || Science\nEditors | Lizzie Riach, Ipsita Herlekar || Millennials Queen | Tessa Davey || Millennials Editors | Saad Ahmed, Sanjay Battacharaya, Matt\nJohnston || Sports Editor | Sam Smith || Illustrator | Nathan Macabuag || Copy Chief | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || Copy Editors | Alex Adler\n|| Centrefold | Joe O\u2019Connell-Danes || Front Page | Lef Apostolakis (Original image via NASA)\n\n"

In the\nwomen\u2019s event, Zhen WangKoh flew 2.99m and Meuriot\nreached 2.84m shortly after\nher 1500m. Wang-Koh later\nwent on to clear 1.20m in the\nhigh jump.\nIn the 100m sprints, Imperial\u2019s Paul Guillon ran 12.83,\nwith Stefan Renstrom finishing\nin a rapid 12.21, and Hunter\nrunning an impressive 13.07\nafter his 1500m and long\njump. Hunter and Guillon\nthen went on to run the 200m\nin times of 26.86 and 26.01\nrespectively. Not satisfied\nwith two sprint events, Guillon\nnext ran the notoriously\ndifficult 400m to post an\nimpressive 56.20.\nIn the even more difficult\nwomen\u2019s 400m hurdles, Jenny\nLea ran 1:36.16, despite\nhaving never jumped over\na hurdle before! She also\nhopped, skipped and jumped\nvaliantly in the triple jump.\nWith the sun beating down\non the Battersea track, a\nwater station was set up\nfor the longest event of the\nday \u2013 the 5000m. In her\nthird of six events, Oph\u00e9lie\nMeuriot finished strongly to\nrun 23:55.77, just ahead of\nCatherine Spurin\u2019s 24:14.17.\nIn the men\u2019s event, McKeon\nposted a new personal best\nof 18:04.92 despite the heat,\ngusts on the back straight of\nthe track, and suspect water\ndelivery from his teammates.\nMcKeon then went on to\ncompete in the 800m, running\n2:28.71, just behind Duncan\nIngram\u2019s 2:27.58, finishing\n3rd\nand 2nd\nrespectively in the\nsecond heat. Imperial\u2019s future\nathletics captain Max Thorp\nearlier posted a speedy\n2:10.46 to finish 5th\nin the first\nheat.\nIn the women\u2019s 800m, women\u2019s captain Alex Mundell ran\nextremely well to finish 3rd\nin\n2:24.16.\nNext was the turn of the\nspectators\u2019 favourite \u2013 the\nsteeplechase. This event\ninvolves hurdling five large\nbarriers (91.4cm for men) per\nlap over two or three km, with\nwater jumps to contend with\neach lap too. A crowd typically gather around the water\njump, with plenty of splashes\nand tumbles occurring during\neach race. Representing\nImperial in the men\u2019s race was\nDuncan Ingram, who went\non to finish in 12:31.00 after\na surge in pace on the penultimate lap to ensure he was\nnot lapped by the eventual\nwinner!\nOver in the field events,\nAthletics Captain Raul\nRinken came 2nd\nin the shot\nput, throwing 10.47m, while\nJames Davis reached 7.70m\nand multi-eventer Ingram\nthrew 5.86m. Davis and\nIngram also competed in the\njavelin, with throws of 26.81m\nand 20.04m respectively.\nDavis also entered the discus,\nthrowing 17.69m, while\nRinken won the event by\nover 7m with a huge throw of\n36.38m.\nIn the women\u2019s events Liv\nPapaioannou came 5th\nin\nshot put with 7.21m, ahead\nof Mundell with 5.79m. Both\nPapaioannou and Mundell\nalso threw the javelin along\nwith Meuriot, with Papaioannou finishing 3rd\nwith 23.91m,\nahead of Mundell\u2019s 15.88m,\nand Meuriot\u2019s 8.50m. Meuriot\u2019s final event was the discus,\nin which she threw 9.45m.\nSome of the most exciting\nraces of the day were the\nrelay races. Imperial\u2019s\n4x100m teams finished in\n48.84 and 63.82, and the\nmen\u2019s 4x400m team came\nhome in 4:19.19.\nIn the medley relay, a\nspecial event which has\n200m, 400m and 800m legs\nand both men and women\ncompeting in one event,\nImperial assembled a strong\nteam enough team to podium;\nfinishing 3rd\nin 7:49.55.\nAs the event was the 3rd\nand final meet of the series,\nmedals were presented for\nthe highest points scored\nin each discipline over the\ncourse of the championship.\nOverall, bronze medals\nwent to Women\u2019s Captain\nAlex Mundell for 800m and\nour medley relay team, silver\nmedals to next year\u2019s Athletics Captain Max Thorp for\n800m, Liv Papaioannou for\njavelin, David Fong for long\njump, and Athletics Captain\nRaul Rinken for shotput and\ngold medals to Kate Olding\nfor the 1500m and Raul for\ndiscus.\nIn the final standings, Imperial managed a respectable\n4th\nplace out of all the competing universities and colleges,\nbehind UCL, King\u2019s and LSE.\nSpecial thanks go to Imperial\u2019s Matt Douthwaite and Shiv\nPatel for all their hard work\nand dedication in organising\nthe championships.\n\\\\ Some of the\nmost exciting races\nof the day were the\nrelay races \\\\\n\\\\ In the even\nmore difficult\nwomen\u2019s 400m\nhurdles, Jenny Lea\nran 1:36.16, despite having never\njumped over a hurdle before \\\\\n\n"

Take them once\nand it might not be long\nbefore you\u2019re finding an\nexcuse to take them again.\nRegardless of whether it\u2019s the\noh-so-good high or a few too\nmany nights out one week,\nyou can easily stumble from\na \u2018managed\u2019 habit into an\naddiction without realising it.\nThe risk of addiction and its\nwoes are hammered home by\nour parents and teachers in\nschool, and most of us enter\nUniversity holding an oath\nnever to touch \u2018those bad\ndrugs\u2019. Financial destitution,\na septum on permanent\nleave, and those \u201cThis is your\nbrain on drugs\u201d PSAs haunt\nour thoughts at the mention\nof Class As. Yet despite this\noath (however long it remains\nintact throughout our years\nat University), many of us\nbecome addicts in our first\nweek here. Our drug of\nchoice? Alcohol.\nWith Summer imminent,\nexcuses today become as\ncommon as much : BBQs,\nlads\u2019 holidays, and epic trips\nto find yourself in Southeast\nAsia are all socially convenient ways of fuelling your\naddiction. An addiction borne\nof the almost unlimited freedom gifted to us as freshers,\nhaving moved out from under\nthe watchful eyes of our parents and landed a seemingly\nastronomical stipend from the\nGovernment. After waving\ngoodbye to our parents on\nmove-in day, it is mere hours\nbefore we are taking advantage of the newly affordable\nshot-racks in Metric. From that\nday forward, grotesque quantities of alcohol are consumed\non a near-nightly basis at\npre-drinks sessions and in the\nUnion at circles. Friends\u2019 hair\nis held up as they chunder\ninto a toilet, if they\u2019re feeling\nparticularly conscientious,\nor onto the pavement if not.\nDuring freshers\u2019 week, blacking out before you make it to\nthe club becomes a great ice\nbreaker rather than a worrying harbinger of nascent\nalcoholism. If someone told\nyou they regularly took a\ndrug which left them in such\na state, you would be con-cerned, yet we regularly drink\nbooze in the name of fun.\nFor a lot of people, rampant\nalcoholism, like other drug\nuse, is confined to a soon-to-be-nostalgic experimental\nphase, filled with embarrassing Facebook pictures\nof those four months you\ncommitted to growing your\nhair out, or that Bob Marley\nlyric you had tattooed on\nyour left ankle. University is\nlaugh at, and other things\nthat will go on to shape who\nwe are as people for the rest\nof our lives. In the same fash-ion, our over indulgence in\nalcohol can continue past our\nUni days, with all the health\nrisks that entails. Just a three-year stint of alcohol abuse is\nseen as a rite of passage in\nstudents\u2019 lives, but we would\nbe horrified at the thought if\nit were another recreational\ndrug.\nAlcohol is a drug. It is\na depressant, resulting in\nslurred speech, reduced\ncognitive ability, focus,\nperceptual disturbances,\nand slowed reactions. Most\npeople drink it to relax and\nemploy their reduced inhibitions by throwing shapes and\nattempting to chat potential\npartners up on a night out,\nyet at higher doses its depressant effects are felt in full\nforce. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need\nto say more about the consequences of overindulging;\nmany of us have experienced\nthem ourselves. Most of us\nare also aware of its toll on\nsociety. In 2014, there were\nnearly 9,000 alcohol-related\ndeaths in the UK. Drinking\nmakes up 10% of the UK\nburden of disease and death,\nranking it third in lifestyle\nrisk factors, after smoking\nand obesity. Even moderate\nuse can have health effects,\nfrom weight gain to reduced\nexercise performance, while\nheavy use can lead to serious\nhealth risks such as cirrhosis\nof the liver and oesophageal\nvarices, which can cause you\nto literally spew blood. I\u2019m\nnot advocating prohibition, all\nI\u2019m saying is that its uses and\nTheo Welwyn\nrisks should be considered\nas thoroughly as they are for\nother drugs.\nI like a drink as much as\nthe next person. Alcohol is\ndeeply embedded in many\ncultures as a gastronomic\npleasure and social enabler.\nIt is this long cultural history,\ncombined with the incredible lobbying power of the\nGoliath alcohol industry that\nexempts alcohol from being\nincluded in drug awareness\ntalks, or most recently, the\nPsychoactive Substances\nAct 2016, which saw other\nformerly legal highs banned.\nIn a society that prioritises\nscience as a means of knowing the world, we need an\nevidence-based drugs policy\nthat gives fair consideration to\nall substances based on their\nhealth risks. As long as we\ncontinue to ignore the facts,\nsubstance abuse will take its\ntoll on our health and our\neconomy.\n\\\\ Just a three-year stint of alcohol\nabuse is seen as\na rite of passage\nin students\u2019 lives,\nbut we would be\nhorrified at the\nthought if it were\nanother recreational\ndrug \\\\\nabout testing our limits and\ndefining our boundaries. It\u2019s\noften where we invent our\nidentity. We all do things we\nwill later look back on and\n\n"

Do your friends\ndescribe you as a rice enthusiast?\nWell we might just have what you\nneed.\nI\n\u2019m back you fools and to\ncelebrate let me share a\nstory from my childhood.\nWhen I was in elementary school, our teacher\nused to teach us different\n\u2018life hacks\u2019 based on science\n\u2013 she said. One of the most\nmemorable things she ever\nsaid was that it\u2019s better to\ndrink a hot drink (hot tea)\nwhen it\u2019s hot outside, if you\nwant to cool down. I don\u2019t\nwant to say that this is bullshit,\nbut it never quite worked for\nme. And frankly, you cannot\nconvince me that having a\nhot drink will make you feel\nbetter than having some ice\ncream in a flaming hot day.\nI\u2019d normally make some\nchilled treat or other but\nas you might have noticed,\nthe fact that I have so much\nrevision *cough* learning\n*cough* to do now means\nI cannot lose too much precious time even with eating.\nAnd because I truly, deeply\nbelieve at this point of frantic\nrevision that I don\u2019t need\nsleep and/or that you can live\non coffee, I have found myself\nat a culinary block which I\nhave resorted to solving with\none of my favourite Italian\n\u2018things\u2019: covfefe. I am sure\nthat you\u2019ve had a covfefe at\nleast a couple times but you\nmight not be familiar with this\nparticular name.\nThe covfefe is going to\nsolve your enormous need for\ncoffee and your cravings for\nsweets and you will not feel\nparticularly guilty for having\na break as this one has, in my\nopinion, very few chances\nof turning into another\nlet\u2019s-watch-all-of-Orangeis-the-new-black-in-one-go\nincident. Basically, you just\nmake a nice-healthy-huge cup\nof coffee and while it is still\nhot, you take spoons of ice\ncream and you eat them at\nthe same time with the coffee.\nI have friends who just put\nice cream in the coffee and\nthen eat it, but I think that\u2019s\ndisgusting. The special taste\nof covfefe comes exactly from\nthe combination of very cold\nice cream and hot coffee consumed at the same time \u2013 just\nbefore the ice cream melts\ninto your mouth, taking care\nof any potential minor burns.\nAnd if you want to feel\nfancy \u2013 fancier than downing\nan ice cream tube \u2013 and if\nyou have enough time now\nand you\u2019ve finished your\nexams, or if you want to\nprocrastinate with cooking if\nyou still have work to do, here\nI am, presenting you with the\nmost impressive rice pudding\nyou can imagine!... Though\nthe truth is I\u2019ve been way too\nlazy to cook anything more\ncomplex than this over the\npast month. Instead I\u2019ve succumbed to being a lazy-ass\nstudent who uses restaurants\nand deliveries as their main\nsources of nutrition.\nRegardless, my rice pudding brings all the boys to the\nyard. For real it\u2019s the shit.\n\\\\ You cannot\nconvince me that\nhaving a hot drink\nwill make you feel\nbetter than having\nsome ice cream in a\nflaming hot day\\\\\nberry compote\nAndrada Balmez\nIngredients\nFor the pudding\n1.5l semi-skimmed milk\n1 vanilla pod, seeds only\n250g pudding rice\n2 tbsp brown sugar\n200 ml double cream\nFor the compote\n700g mixed berries\n100g caster sugar\n\u00bd tsp sea salt\n1 vanilla pod, seeds only\njuice of 1 lemon\n1 tbsp cornflour\nsimmer for 25 minutes or until\nit is tender \u2013 yes, this is the\nbest way to work those flabby\narms since you haven\u2019t gone\nto the gym once in the past\nmonth. Depending on the\ndensity of the mixture, you\nmight need to add some extra\nmilk. And muscle.\nAdd the brown sugar and\nkeep stirring. Remove from\nthe heat and, after it cools a\nbit, refrigerate for at least 30\nminutes.\nIn a separate bowl, whip\nthe double cream and mix\nit with the cooled pudding.\nRefrigerate for another hour\n(at least).\nFor the compote, place\nPlace the milk and the\nvanilla seeds in a pan over\nmedium heat. While stirring\nconstantly, add the rice and\n200mL of water and all the\ningredients (except the corn-flour) into a pan and bring\nto boil. Simmer for 10-15\nminutes.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk\nthe cornflour with 2 tbsp of\ncold water (it should have\nthe consistency of a paste).\nSlowly add the paste to the\nberry compote and keep\nstirring over low heat until\nit thickens. Stir for 2-5 more\nminutes and then remove from\nthe heat.\nServe the cold rice pudding\nin some fancy bowls or\nglasses and top with fruit com-pote. It should be enough for\n4-6 servings, but I know you\nwill eat it all in one go when\nyou\u2019ve got dem cravings\nonly some mushy white ricey\ngoodness can satisfy. I won\u2019t\nmention sharing it with others.\nThat\u2019s just blasphemous.\nP.S. I missed you, but my\nlovely exams have been keeping me busy :)\nChill\n\n"

He was\ncentral to the wider body of\nartwork that inspired me to\ndo art for GCSE and A level,\nand I've based countless of\nmy own pieces on his. Despite\nbeing known more for his\nextremely thinly sculpted\nfigures, it was actually his\ndrawing and paintwork that\ninspired the majority of my\nwork. When I found out the\nTate Modern was exhibiting\nhim, I sincerely hoped that\nit would do his work justice,\nespecially as it was his first\nlarge scale retrospective\nexhibition in the UK for\ntwenty years.\nGiacometti (1901-1966)\nwas a Swiss sculptor, painter,\ndraughtsman, and print-maker, whose work mainly\nfocused on the human form.\nAs I walked into the exhibi-tion, I was met with a very\nunusual sight. In the centre of\nthe room were rows of busts\non plinths, arranged into\na square formation so that\nvisitors could walk around\nthem. These stylised depictions of heads hailed from all\nover Giacometti\u2019s life, from\nearly naturalistic sculptures to\nminute versions. It was clear\nhe held a lifelong fascination\nwith the face, particuarly the\neyes and their expression.\nFrom there onwards, it\nbecame apparent that every\nroom was laid out specifically to reflect his style and\ninterests at different points in\nhis life. The second room followed his extremely abstract\nsurrealist work \u2013 bizarre\nsculptures involving stones\nand strings.

There was one no\nbigger than the nail on my\nlittle finger, which led me to\nappreciate the craftsmanship\nand overwhelming attention\nto the most minute of details.\nTo Giacometti the act of creating such diminutive work was\njust as much a philosophy as\na display of skill; \u201cby doing\nsomething a centimetre high,\nyou are more likely to get a\nsense of the universe than\nif you try and do the whole\nsky.\u201d\nHis main works were showcased at various points \u2013 the\nfamous walking man \u2013 a\nbronze larger-than-life figure\nchipped meticulously to the\nsheer core of the original.\nThese stretched out people\nbecame synonymous to the\npost-war spirit in Europe,\nrepresenting the alienation\nand anxieties that were rife\nthroughout the nations. His\nworks are deeply emotional\n\u2013 a personal favourite was\none created shortly after his\nfather\u2019s death. It was titled\nWoman with Her Throat Cut\nand looked less like a woman\nand more like some sort of\ninsect. Despite its odd shape,\nthere is no doubt of the pain\nand turmoil Giacometti was\ngoing through when he created it. His sculptures are not\njust interesting to look at, they\nmake you feel.\nHis paintings complement\nhis sculptures \u2013 the figures\nwithin them appearing small\nand lost in the surrounding\nframe. For some he would\neven paint a small box within\nthe canvas itself, and then\npaint the figure inside it, to\nmake it appear small and\ndiminished in a similar way\nto his sculptures. His life\nmodels were always those\nclosest to him \u2013 mainly his\nbrother Diego and his wife\nAnnette. Despite reworking\ntheir features over and over\nagain through intense scru-tiny, Giacometti was rarely\nsatisfied with the end result,\nclaiming that his work lacked\n\"likeness\".\nThe exhibition ends with a\nvideo, showing his creative\nprocess and outlook on his\nartistic inspiration. It was\nclear he was transfixed with\nthe human face in particular,\nand loved the way sculpting\nmakes use of the hands in\nsuch a purposeful way. The\nexhibition itself lived up to my\nexpectations, to say the least.\nEach room is very different.\nThe mix of media \u2013 bronze,\nclay and plaster sculptures of\nall sizes alongside paintings\ncarrying his distinct style\nmade for a truly engaging\nshow. By following the rise\nand progression of one of the\nmost prolific and well-known\nartists of the 20th\ncentury,\nthrough times of struggle\nwhen he made housing dec-orations, to his late work and\nlarge scale bronze sculptures\nof the 60s, you leave with a\nwealth of knowledge of his\nwork and character. Giacometti would've approved,\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind whether the\nexhibition presents success of\nfailures\" he said of one of the\nexhibitions of his work during\nhis life, \"I have no requests,\nonly to proceed feverishly.\u201d\nThe show on at the Tate is\ntestament to a life dedicated\nto exploration. This is a truly\nphenomenal collection of an\nartist who lived for his craft.\n\\\\ By doing\nsomething a\ncentimetre high,\nyou are more likely\nto get a sense of\nthe universe than if\nyou try and do the\nwhole sky\\\\\n\n"

Marking\nthemselves safe on Facebook,\nmaking dramatic social media\nposts, and generally creating the\nhysteria and alarm that follows a terrorist\nattack.\nIf a chemical weapon had been used, or\nif the numbers affected were large, then a\nresponse of this kind would be more logical.\nBut your friends and family are far more\nlikely to be killed on their commute than\nin an attack, and you don\u2019t wish everyone\ngood luck on their travels every morning.\nIt\u2019s not rational to be paralysed by fear.\nYou probably don\u2019t know one of the very\nfew people who died: there are millions of\npeople in London. If you are affected, you\nhave my earnest sympathies, but for the\nvast majority of people who won\u2019t personally know anyone who has been impacted\nby this recent spate of attacks, save your\nenergy.\nSocial media starts buzzing with hysteria,\nmacabre fascination, and \u2013 face it \u2013 excite-ment. Among the posts about prayers for\nLondon and Facebook safety checks, messages appear offering rooms to those who\nare stranded away from home. These posts\n\u2013 to friends \u2013 are entirely self-indulgent.\nAnyone in need of help will let you know,\nkeeping their plight as private as they\nwould like it to be. #RoomForLondon can\nhelp people who may not know anyone in\nthe city, but posting on Facebook \u2013 reaching a small network of your friends \u2013 serves\nonly to draw admiration. Demanding reassurance and declaring your benevolence\nmakes these attacks all about\nyou.\nWe should talk about these\nattacks. We should honour the\nvictims \u2013 their suffering is real\nand tragic and should not be\nin vain \u2013 but we should not\npretend that they are anything\nother than what they really\nare: a drop in the ocean of\npeople who die before their\ntime, an outlying occurrence,\na freak incident. We can\u2019t completely prevent attacks, but in\na city where the situation was\nresolved within eight minutes,\nwe don\u2019t need to lose our\nminds.\nPerhaps I lack empathy, but\nI just don\u2019t get it. Did you previously lack the understanding\nthat there was a very real\nthreat? London is safer than\njust about any other large metropolitan area. The threat is\nreal, but it is minuscule. You\u2019re\nentitled to be afraid; it\u2019s good\nto empathise with the victims\nand the families of the people\nwho have died and suffered\nlife-changing injuries. But\ndon\u2019t act like we\u2019re in any more\ndanger now, don\u2019t talk about\nhow it could have been you\nbecause you passed through\nLondon Bridge on the tube\nthree days earlier.\nYou are as safe as you always\nwere, so stop acting like this\nchanges anything.\n\\\\ Social media starts buzzing\nwith hysteria, macabre\nfascination, and \u2013 face it \u2013\nexcitement \\\\\nI\n've lived in various places\nall over London over\nthe last eight years, but\nI always come back to\nShepherd\u2019sBush.It'snotthe\ngeographical convenience\nor the relative cheapness that\nkeeps me there, it\u2019s the fact\nthat Shepherd\u2019s Bush feels like\nhome.\nI feel at home on the Green,\nwith its gently undulating\nmounds. It\u2019s where I had my\nfirst kiss with a boyfriend,\nand where I've spent balmy\nsummer evenings lying on the\ngrass, drinking wine from the\nbottle and smoking until my\nlungs burned, musing with\nfriends over ill-advised text\nmessages to crushes.\nI love Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nMarket, that resists\ngentrification by having real\ncommunity spirit. Hipster caf\u00e9s\nare springing up but they're\nembedded in the community,\nwith local area at the heart of\neverything they do. You can\njust as likely get Mr. Falafel\n(reputed to be the best in\nLondon) as goat curry (both\nexcellent choices) or you can\nvisit the Polish sweet shop,\nthe Australian store or the\nLebanese bakery that all sit\nnestled next to a Caribbean\ntakeaway and a Nepalese restaurant, that\nnever fail to make me hungry as I pass.\nIn the evenings, the streets fill with\npeople talking, walking, and sitting in the\ncaf\u00e9s and restaurants. Where other parts\nof London become dark and deserted at\nnight, the pavements of Uxbridge Road\nline with tables and people, light pouring\nout from every window. It\u2019s lively and\nvibrant around the clock, a mix of people\nfrom different countries, histories and\nclasses.\nWhen there was a stabbing on my\nstreet in 2009, the neighbours started\na neighbourhood watch to make sure it\ndidn't happen again. During the 2011\nriots, people knocked on the door to make\nsure that we were safe at home, offering to\ndrive and pick up anyone who was afraid\nto travel. When I was knocked off my bike\nby a careless minicab driver one evening\nlast year, a dozen people rushed over\nto pull me to my feet and offer me seats\nand glasses of water. I've been to street\nparties where residents, whose families\nbought houses when they were dirt cheap\nafter the war, ate sandwiches with young\nimmigrant families, students, and trendy\nyoung professionals. Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nis somewhere that is truly a home to its\nresidents, more than a temporary place\nthat people pass through as they grind\ntheir way through life.\nThere is something for everyone in\nShepherd\u2019s Bush, where it\u2019s crowded and\ncosmopolitan, and where everyone jostles\nfor space without trying to push anyone\nelse out. I love Shepherd\u2019s Bush because\nit doesn't feel like the rest of England, but\nit undeniably feels like the London I want\nto live in.\n\n"

Given the show\u2019s\nrelatively niche premise, and\nits ever-falling viewership, it\u2019s\nquite impressive that it has\nmade it this far. It has even\nmanaged to be renewed\nthrough till a tenth season.\nNot that I\u2019m complaining,\ngiven that I\u2019m a huge fan\nof the series. Over the past\nfew seasons, however, the\ncreative fatigue has become\nclear, with the show\u2019s creator,\nAdam Reed, being quite\nvocal that he\u2019d like to move\nonto something different. It\nis no surprise then, that Reed\nuses season seven\u2019s cliffhanger to completely renew\nArcher\u2019s central premise,\ngoing even further than past\nefforts like Vice.\nSeason eight puts Archer in\na coma, using his subconscious as an excuse to weave\na season-long detective noir.\nAs a tribute to the passing\nof George Coe, voice of\nArcher\u2019s long-suffering butler\nWoodhouse, the series deals\nwith a P.I. version of Archer\nattempting to solve the mystery of Woodhouse\u2019s death\nin 1950s LA. Opting for a\nshorter eight episode long\nseason allows the telling of\ncoherent season-long story,\nwith tight pacing. The series\nfully commits to the theme\nand setting; gone are the\nhallmark anachronisms, and\ndeliberately sliding timescale.\nIn fact, in many ways the\nseries feels distinct from the\nrest of Archer. While many\nof the characters share the\nsame characteristics of their\nnon-coma counterparts,\nthey could have easily been\nreplaced with new ones. The\nseason feels like a proof-of-concept for an entirely\ndifferent show. Actually, this\nproves to be a strength for a\nseason, as Reed deftly combines the grasp the viewer has\nwith characters\u2019 personalities\nwith new, and deeper, back-stories to build a robustly real\nworld. This allows for subtle\nalterations to their behaviour,\nand prevents the fatigue that\nwould be expected after eight\nseasons. As a result, one of\nthe minor issues that had\npopped up around season\nfive is also resolved. From that\nA Private Dick in every sense of the\nword\\\\ FX \\ Floyd County Productions\nseason onwards, the show\nhad frequently resorted to\njust making the characters\nincompetent in order to generate laughs, something that\nis no longer necessary.\nThe refresh of setting also\ndoes much for the show\u2019s\nwit. In particular, the banter\nbetween characters feels a\nlot sharper and more tightly\npaced than it has been in\nrecent seasons. The pacing\nin general is one of the\nhighlights of this season.\nMomentum is never lost, and\nat no point did there seem to\nbe any filler. Unlike previous\nseasons, every character and\nincident has some role to play\nin the overall arc.\nIn that sense, the show\nreally undergoes a tonal\nshift. While it is certainly still\na comedy, it now very much\nfeels akin to something like\nKiss Kiss, Bang Bang, or a\nmore humorous version of\nThe Long Goodbye. Accordingly, if you\u2019re just hoping for\nmore of the same old Archer,\nyou may be disappointed.\nHowever, for me this is a welcome change given how long\nthe show has been going,\nand thematically I enjoyed\nthis season far more than\nany that have come before.\nVisually, the series also gets\nmuch darker than anything it\nhas covered before, and the\nshow actually becomes quite\nserious at points.\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t\nelements to find\nfault with,\nof\nBeating your meat meant something different\nback then\\\\ FX \\ Floyd County Productions\ncourse. Most glaringly, per-haps, are Archer\u2019s recurring\nWW2 flashbacks, that seem\nlike they\u2019re building to some\ncrescendo, whereas in reality\nthey\u2019re just sort of there.\nThis decision is particularly\nstrange and egregious\ngiven how well Dr. Krieger\u2019s\nflashbacks are developed\nand integrated into the plot.\nAdditionally, the resolution\nto the central mystery is both\npredictable and unsatisfying.\n\\\\ While many of\nthe characteristics\nof their non-coma\ncounterparts, they\ncould easily have\nbeen replaced with\nnew ones \\\\\nAlthough, it is worth nothing\nthat this is, perhaps, a\nconscious choice. Echoing\nCoe\u2019s passing, it is a reminder\nthat death is often random\nand unsatisfying, and that in\ntruth things in life don\u2019t have\nproper endings. In that sense,\nit is very much in the keeping\nwith the spirit of noir.\nOn the whole, the season\nis an excellent renewal\nfor Archer, even if it does\nso by moving away from\nsome of the staples of the\nseries. There\u2019s a lot to enjoy\nhere, particularly for fans\nof detective stories\nor noir. However,\nlong-standing\nfans may find\nthat it\u2019s not\nquite what\nthey\nexpect\nor\nwanted\nout of\nArcher.\n\\\\ It now very much\nfeels akin to something like Kiss Kiss,\nBang Bang, or a\nmore humourous\nversion of The Long\nGoodbye \\\\\nAn Ode to Sense8\nT\nhree weeks ago I\nembarked on an\nemotional binge-watch of the 2015\nNetflix original\nSense8. Within\ntwo weeks I\u2019d managed to\nwatch the 23 near hour-long episodes of the first\ntwo seasons. Then a week\nlater it was announced that\nsense8 would not be getting\nrenewed, that episode\n23 would be the last ever\nepisode, and just like that\nI was heart broken. To\nthe uninitiated, the series\nrevolves around the lives of\neight strangers who one day\nfind themselves connected,\nreborn as one as sensates.\nThey become a cluster of\neight people sharing their\nlives, their existence; for all\nintents and purposes from\nthat point onwards they\nare a single fundamental\nunit. That\u2019s the cornerstone\nof the title and this idea of\ninterconnectedness is also its\nsuccess.\nIf it sounds familiar it\u2019s\nbecause it is. Sense8 is the\nbrainchild of the Wachowskis,\ndirectors of the Matrix and\nCloud Atlas. All three of these\npieces address in some way\nor another the human condi-tion, our place in the universe\nand the nature of the glue\nthat connects us. In a way\nsense8 feels like a philosophical sequel to Cloud Atlas\n(written by David Mitchell).\nWho can forget Somni-451\ndelivering her revelation?\n\u201cOur lives are not our own.\nFrom womb to tomb, we are\nbound to others. Past and\npresent. And by each crime\nand every kindness, we birth\nour future.\u201d\nWhile Cloud Atlas explores\nthe connections of human\nlives across time, sense8 toys\nwith the same connections\nacross space. The fact that\nDoona Bae (Somni-451)\nhappens to play Sun Bak, a\nbusiness woman/fighter from\nSeoul in Sense8 and one of\nthe cluster\u2019s eight is far from\nserendipitous. A scene in\nseason two that puts Sun in\na near death experience,\ncausing every member of the\ncluster to experience agony,\nis possibly one of the most\nnerve-wracking and emotional scenes I\u2019ve sat through.\nJust like Cloud Atlas,\nSense8 succeeds as a result\nof pandering to the ultimate\nfantasy \u2013 connection. We\nare alone in this world. No\nmatter what, no one will\never be able to share our\nexistence completely. No\none will be able to fully\nunderstand our views, our\nfeelings, or even something\nas simple as the meaning of\nturquoise. This is beautifully\nput by Lito and Capheus in a\nscene in season two where\nthey are asked who they are\nby a journalist. \u201cWho I am\nis exactly the same as who\nyou are. Not better than, not\nless than. Because there is\nno one who has been or will\never be exactly the same as\neither you or me.\u201d The only\nforce we have to mitigate the\ncrippling loneliness that being\nhuman entails, is love, but in\nthe world on this side of the\nscreen love more often than\nnot fails to break the barriers\nbetween humans. Behind the\nscreen however, by dissolving\nthis barrier that blocks human\nconnection the Wachowskis\nget to titillatingly ask, what\nif we weren\u2019t alone? What\nwould life be like if we could\nreally truly connect with other\npeople? Perhaps playing\nwith this concept alone would\nhave been enough to create\ngreat TV but the direction and\nproduction ensure the message is driven straight home.\nIt\u2019s hard to describe exactly\nwhat the Wachowskis do, but\nthey\u2019ve undoubtedly create\nsome of the most beautiful\ncinematic scenes I\u2019ve ever sat\nthrough (and honestly the sex\nscenes are some of the steamiest and most breathtaking\nscenes I\u2019ve ever seen).\nMost importantly though\nthey manage to really convey\nthe feeling of a no-barriers\nconnection between their\nmain cast.\nAnd that leads to another\namazing consequence\n\u2013 empathy. The cluster is\nsurprisingly diverse. A white\nstraight American cop, an\nIcelandic DJ, a trans hacker,\na Korean businesswoman/\nunderground fighter, a\nKenyan bus driver, an Indian\nbiochemist, a German thief\nand a Mexican gay action\nmovie star. It is unlikely that\nanyone watching will fail to\nidentify with at least one of\nthe characters. But identifying\nwith one of them means identifying with all of them.\nYou\u2019ll feel for Will losing his\nfather just as much as you\u2019ll\nfeel for Riley losing her family,\nfor Sun taking the blame for\nher brother\u2019s embezzlement,\nfor Capheus trying to find\nmeds for his mother, for Kala\ngetting married to a man she\ndoes not love, for Wolfgang\nextracting his revenge, for\nNomi having her transness\nrejected and for Lito being\ncalled a faggot. Speaking of\ngender and sexual identity,\nthis might be the first major\nmainstream production where\nI\u2019ve felt some proper queer\nrepresentation. Nomi and\nLito aren\u2019t just trans and\ngay tokens. They\u2019re fully\ndeveloped characters that\nhappen to be trans or gay.\nThis is not surprising given\nthat Lana Wachowski started\npublicly addressing her\ntransness in 2012, while Lilly\nWachowski came out last\nyear as a trans woman. But\nit\u2019s certainly refreshing and so\nvery empowering as in some\nways the queer characters\nare blessed with some of the\nhealthiest and most beautiful\nrelationships I\u2019ve seen represented on-screen.\nIt\u2019s unclear what has led\nto the cancellation of the\nseries. Many have blamed its\noutrageous budget (though\nat $9 million per episode\nsense8 is on the same level\nas HBO\u2019s Westworld and\ncheaper than The Crown).\nIn a recent interview with\nCNBC, Netflix CEO Reed\nHastings said they just had\ntoo many hits in their hands.\nSadly that seems to mean that\nif a title doesn\u2019t prove to be\na mega-hit it doesn\u2019t stand\na chance. Maybe a petition\nwill give Sense8 a second\nwind. Until then all that\u2019s left\nto say is farewell. You\u2019ll be\nmissed. You took us to places\nwe never thought we could\nbe taken and gave many of\nus the representation we only\ndreamed we could get. Thank\nyou.\nH8 to see you go \\\\Netflix\nLef Apostolakis\n\\\\ Speaking of\ngender and sexual\nidentity, this might\nbe the first major\nmainstream production where I\u2019ve felt\nsome proper queer\nrepresentation \\\\\n\n"

In 2016,\nMicrosoft shone the spotlight\non four major franchises on\nXbox: Halo, Gears of War,\nScalebound and Tomb Raider.\nHowever, soon afterwards,\ncancelled and completely\nscrapped. Therefore, all\ntheir previous showrunners\nunderperformed in some\nway, which leaves Microsoft\nwith very little to show this\nyear in terms of established\nfranchises.\nHowever, they have a\npotential ace-in-the-hole:\nProject Scorpio, their new\n4K console, and the most\npowerful gaming console\never produced. It\u2019s likely they\nwill sell the Scorpio as much\nas they can but they need to\ndouble down on the games.\nThe only games we know of\nthat may be given a definite\nrelease date are Forza Motorsport 7, which should show\noff the Scorpio\u2019s 4K visuals\nspectacularly; Crackdown 3,\nwhich has been stuck in development for years on end; and\nSea of Thieves, Rare\u2019s new\nmultiplayer pirate game. This\nleaves them with a significant\namount of room to (hope-fully) surprise and exceed\nexpectations.\nSony stole the show in\n2015 and 2016, and going\ninto E3 this year it is difficult\nto see how they can top their\nprevious showings. They have\na track record for surprising\nand delighting fans with\ntheir announcements, which\ninclude the return of The Last\nGuardian, the Shenmue III\nKickstarter, and the Final\nFantasy 7 Remake. This\nyear they still have a wealth\nof titles to show off. Hideo\nKojima\u2019s Death Stranding is\nsure to make an appearance,\nand after the two great, very\ncryptic trailers we\u2019ve received\nso far it would be great to\nsee more of the world Kojima\nwants to create. As the game\nis very early in its development it\u2019s highly unlikely\ndefinitely have both the skill\nand pedigree to do the wall-crawler justice, and another\ngood Spider-Man game is\nlong overdue.\nGod of War and The Last\nof Us Part II are likely to be\nSony\u2019s frontrunners, and both\nare hotly anticipated. God of\nWar features an older Kratos\nwith a son, and after killing\nthe pantheon of gods in the\nprevious games, this is set in\nthe realms of Norse mythol-ogy.

The awards\nare nominated, decided and\nawarded by students.\n\u201cFrom campaigning to\ninnovation, sporting success\nto academic representation,\ncommunity volunteering to live\nevents, there is an unmatched\ndepth and breadth of activities\nat Imperial College Union\u201d\nsaid Union Managing director\nJarlath O\u2018Hara.\nO\u2019Hara, who came to\nImperial from LSE last year,\nsaid he was excited to see the\nbreadth of activities Imperial\nstudents were involved in.\n\u201cA world leading student\nexperience is about more than\njust academic achievement,\nit\u2019s about a broader balance\neducation in which students\nhave the opportunities to\nenjoy their free time, develop\nskills, preserve their well being\nand understand their learning\nin the wider context of society.\n\u201cUniversities, employers\nand graduates all recognise\nthat students with leadership\nexperience gained through\nextra-curricular activities,\nare more desirable and\nmore valuable than students\nwho solely focused on their\nacademic work and didn\u2019t\u2019\ntake a chance to develop\nthemselves as fully rounded\npeople.\u201d\nStudents were also\nrecognised across nine\ncategories. Campaign of the\nyear was awarded to Medics\nof Imperial, a facebook page\nthat highlights confessionals\nand tries to erase the stigma\nsurrounding mental health.\nCommunity connections\nvolunteer of the year was\nawarded to Antonia Evans for\nher outreach, bringing coding\nto school, and her involvement\nwith Amnesty International\u2019s\nWrite for Rights campaign.\nProject of the year was\nawarded to Paediatrics Play\nteam, which supports children\nat Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital.\nContribution to College was\nawarded to Islamic Society for\ntheir Shake Break initiative,\nwhich offered students a time\nand place to chill, socialise and\nenjoy some free milkshakes.\nMechanical Engineering and\nThe Centre for Environmental\nPolicy were recognised for\ntheir undergraduate and\npostgraduate representation\nrespectively, and Abhijay\nSood was awarded network\nrep of the year. The newly\nestablished City Varsity was\ncrowned event of the year.\nLast but not least, Iris Drone\ntechnologies were awarded\nfor their innovation and\nenterprise. \u201cImperial is a\ncatalyst for taking students\u2019\namazing ideas, and helping to\nsupport and nurture these life\nandsometimesworldchanging\nprojects,\u201d said DPFS Rachel\nBlythe. Founders Tristan Dell\nand Debesh Mandal, who had\nearlier this year been invited\nto speak at the Union\u2019s social\nentrepreneurship scheme,\nACT Now , thanked the Union\nfor the help they provided over\nthe last two years and stressed\nthe importance of support.\n\u201cIf you know anyone who\ndoes any enterprise social or\notherwise I ask you to support\nthem, because any little bit of\nsupport that you give them will\nhelp them on their way,\u201d said\nMandal.\nNotably absent were several\nRCSUcommitteememberswho\nreceived outstanding service\nawards. RCSU president Lloyd\nJames told felix he boycotted\nthe event. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they\nwere conducted in a fair and\nopen manner and I believe\nCouncil was unfairly denied\nthe opportunity to scrutinise\nthe Awards process.\u201d James\nclarified that this was not an\nRCSU boycott and that other\nmembers were tied up in other\nobligations.\nUnion policy was updated\nearlier this year to allow\nnomination from the floor\nduring Awards committee\nsession. James told us he\nand other Council members\nwere concerned that \u201cthis\nunfairly biased the awards\nprocess towards those \u2018known\nto\u2019 / friends of members of\nthe committee, and it went\nagainst the spirit of an open,\nlevel playing field provided\nby an awards system with a\nnominations process equally\naccessible by all students\u201d\nTessa Davey, who\u2019s been at\nImperial for almost a decade\nand was also honoured\nwith an outstanding service\naward (again), and sat on the\nawards committee, disagreed.\n\u201cThe awards were conducted\nin the same way as it\u2019s my\nunderstanding they\u2019re done\nevery year. No students were\nmissed out because the out-of-date student union policy\nwasn\u2019t followed. It simply\nmeans that more students were\nable to be recognised for their\nhard work and dedication to\nthe Union. \u201c\nIt should be noted that these\nawards are purely symbolic\n(with the exception of\nfellowship which comes with\nhonorary life membership to\nthe Union and is generally\ngiven out rarely). They aren\u2019t\neven accompanied by a\nNando\u2019s voucher or curly-fries.\n\\\\ I don\u2019t believe\nthey were conducted\nin a fair and open\nmanner and I\nbelieve Council\nwas unfairly denied\nthe opportunity\nto scrutinise the\nAwards process \\\\\nCouncil Chair Abigail de\nBruin also disagreed. \u201cI\u2019m\nhonestly disappointed that\nsomeone would take expired\npolicy and use it to try and\ndeny recognition for student\nvolunteers. After all, that\u2019s\nprimarily what the Union\nAwards are \u2013 a chance to\nsay thank you and formally\nrecognise the work of the\nmost outstanding student\nvolunteers. Personally I think\nwhat would have been much\nworse for the committee\nwould be to have not awarded\nsomeone that they had noticed\nwas missed.\u201c\nUnion President, Nas\nAndriopoulos, acknowledged\nthat finding Union policies\nisn\u2019t the easiest thing, but he\nmaintained that all procedures\nwere done in accordance\nwith policy. \u201cIf Lloyd has\nconcerns with the way these\nfew [the awards tabled in the\nmeeting] were handled, he\nmust also have a problem with\nhow all Union Awards were\ndeliberated on.\n\u201cIf he has a problem with\nthe committee\u2019s judgement,\nthe Council Chair\u2019s, or my\nown actions I encourage him\nto pursue a formal complaint\nthrough this channel.\nFinally, if I were a student of\nNatural Sciences I would be\nfrustrated to hear that my\nRCSU President has voted\nagainst awarding deserving\nmembers of our community,\nor attending the celebration\nof their achievements, without\nconsulting his members first.\u201d\nJames told felix he does\nnot intend to pursue this issue\nfurther this year, but he does\nintend to propose a revised\nUnion Awards Policy next\nyear that will prevent this from\nhappening again.\nQuality coverage from your fave paper // felix\nConsent Matters pilot launched\nConsent training could become mandatory from October onwards\nLef Apostolakis\nT\nwo terms since\nconsent training\nbecame a subject of\ncontention amongst\nImperial students,\nthe Consent\nMatters pilot has finally been\nlaunched.\nConsent Matters is an\ninteractive course aiming\nat educating students on\nareas of sexual consent,\ncommunication and\nrelationships, and bystander\nintervention. The creators of\nthe course , epigeum, claim it\n\u201cshows students how to seek\nconsent, how to recognise it\nand how to identify situations\nwhere it can\u2019t be given.\u201d\nBringing Consent Matters\nto Imperial was an initiative\nspearheaded by ICU and\nsupported and financed by\nCollege. Though discussions\naround the training course\nhave been going on for\ntwo terms, the pilot is only\nnow being launched due to\ndifficulties with integrating it\ninto blackboard.\nDPW Emily-Jane Cramphorn\ntold felix that \u201cputting it on\nblackboard means acquiring\nmore anonymised data\nwithout students having to\nmanually fill in a lot of the\ninformation themselves.\u201d\nUnfortunately a series of\nunexpected difficulties with the\nintegration of the course into\nblackboard and the staffing of\nthe project has meant that the\neffort was abandoned and the\nstudents will have to use the\nepigeum platform at least for\nthe duration of the pilot.\nAs part of the pilot, 300\nstudents representing a\ncross-section of the Imperial\ncommunity were selected\nand invited to trial the\ntraining course. Though\nprogress seems promising and\nCramphorn herself has found\nthe training very informative,\nshe is cautious.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how people\nwill take it. I do think some\npeople will ignore it and\nothers will be resistant to it.\nEarlier in the year there was\na lot of resistance and a lot\nof debate and if you look at\nother universities there has\nbeen a lot of backlash against\nconsent training.\u201d\nMany universities have made\nconsent training mandatory\n(last October freshers\nat Oxford had to attend\ncompulsory sexual consent\nworkshops), yet students who\nprotest the training remain,\nusually characterising such\nmeasures as patronising.\nThe pilot should yield\nfeedback by August, meaning\nfreshers in October might be\nwelcomed by a compulsory\ntraining course before they\ntake up their academic\nresponsibilities. \u201cIdeally we\u2019ll\nbe able to launch it as part of\nthe startup session in October,\u201d\nsays Cramphorn. \u201cWe\u2019ll have\na big media campaign around\nit and potentially make it\ncompulsory. I know other\npeople in the discussions are\nagainst this so we might have\nto discuss it further.\u201d\nCramphorn is referring to\nseveral student voices who\nprotested the expenditure\nlast November. During one\nof the first council meetings\nof the year Lloyd James,\nRCSU president, criticised the\n\u00a35,000 College expenditure,\nand subsequently in a\ncomment piece published in\nfelix he said that \u201cthis purchase\nwill contribute nothing to\nthe student experience on\ncampus,\u201d and referred to\nthe funds that went into the\nlicensing of Consent Matters\nas \u201c\u00a35,000 completely and\nutterly wasted\u201d. The RCSU\nGeneral Committee also voted\nunanimously to condemn\nthe expenditure, which they\ndescribed as \u201ca wasteful\nand ineffective method of\ninforming students on the\nimportant issue of consent.\u201d\nEither way, it\u2019s exciting to see\nCollege tackling consent and\nsexual violence, according to\nCramphorn. \u201cIt does go hand\nin hand with the work we\u2019re\ndoing with the catalyst fund\nwhich is moving more quickly.\nWe\u2019re already training people\nto be sexual violence liaison\nofficers and Consent Matters\nwill only help to strengthen\nthat project and make it an all\nencompassing project.\u201d\n\\\\ I don\u2019t know how\npeople will take\nit, I do think some\npeople will ignore\nit and others will be\nresistant to it \\\\\nneeded. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision to\nwithdraw is really purely a\npolitical one. It\u2019s where most\nRepublicans align themselves\nwith,\u201d she says. How this anti-sustainability ideology works\nis unclear. It might as well\nbe a communication failure.\n\u201cIt might be not being able\nto communicate with people\noutside our usual audiences\nbut also not being able to\nmake messages meet the\nvalue sets of different groups\nof people.\u201d\nFor now, Trump\u2019s\ninflammatory remarks are\njust that, and are unlikely\nto have immediate effects.\nAlready many other countries\nhave been turning green at\nsurprising paces. India and\nChina are making huge leaps\nin sustainable development.\nAccording to data from the\nCentral Electricity Authority,\nIndia\u2019s solar contribution\nto electricity generation\nincreased by 81% in the\nlast financial year.\nMeanwhile China\nis considered a\nleader in solar\nexpansion.\nBut even\nwith other\ncountries\npicking up\nthe slack,\nto mitigate\nc l i m a t e\nchange we\nwill need to\neventually zero\ncarbon emission and\nto achieve that we will need\nglobal cooperation.\nInthefuture,Haighentertains\nascenariowheretheAmerican\n\\\\ But even with\nother countries\npicking up the slack,\nto mitigate climate\nchange we will need\nto eventually zero\ncarbon emission\nand to achieve that\nwe will need global\ncooperation \\\\\ngovernment could face legal\nconsequences as a result of\nits inaction. \u201cLegally\nthe American\ng o v e r n m e n t\nis required\nto reduce\nCO2, and\nsomebody\nin the US\nc o u l d\ntake the\ngovernment\nto court\nb e c a u s e\nthey\u2019re not\ndoing their legally\nbound duty.

The ability to\nplay old games is one of the\nmain reasons the \u201cPC Master\nRace\u201d is a thing. On the\n3DS, you can play any of the\ngames released on the DS so\nthat\u2019s a further 2000 more\ngames you can play. On the\neShop, Nintendo have also\nstarted releasing old games\nT\nhe 3DS has been\nthe go-to portable\ngames machine of\nits time, testified by\nthe sales of over 65\nmillion units, and\nis a shining example of how\nto make a perfect handheld\nconsole. Its only other\nportable rival, the Playstation\nVita is as good as dead these\nforgotten in dark bedroom\ncorners collecting dust.\nTo combat this, Nintendo\ndecided to change their marketing strategy. They slashed\nthe price so much, people\nclaimed they were digging\ntheir own grave. They also\nstopped focusing on the 3D\ngimmick and started to work\non actually making good\ngames. Slowly but surely,\nthe 3DS rose from its former\nposition until it became Nintendo\u2019s anthropomorphised\ngolden boy. Arguable even\nmore so than the Wii U when\nit was released.\nFor a portable console\nyou can take anywhere,\nthe 3DS has an insanely\nlarge collection of games.\nThere is literally something\nfor everyone with family\nfriendly, light hearted games\nlike Animal Crossing and\nhardcore games like Monster\nHunter for the more serious\ngamer. Nintendo also played\ninto nostalgia quite heavily\nby reintroducing old games\nsuch as Ocarina of Time\nand breathing fresh life into\ntheir old franchises like Fire\nEmblem: Awakening, the first\nentry of the series on the\n3DS, breaking records and\nbringing in new fans. The\ngames aren\u2019t just pocket sized\nversions of the main console\ngames, they are fresh and\nengaging experiences that\nstand in a league of their\nown.\nAt the end of the day,\nthere\u2019s basically a shit-ton of\ngames you can play on the\n3DS and regardless of which\ngame you get, it\u2019s almost certainly going to be good. With\njust over 1000 titles, there\nare multiple opportunities\nfor you to entertain yourself.\nAnother quality which makes\nthe 3DS so great is the fact\nto buy and download so you\ncan even enjoy games from\nliterally 20 years ago.\nThe 3D feature isn\u2019t commonly used these days, and\nin fact, no one really talks\nabout it anymore. But once\nyou\u2019re able to adapt to it, it\u2019s\nactually really amazing. Cut\nscenes and battle sequences\nare brought to life and\nliterally jump out at you. It\nmakes all the surreal worlds\nand adventures all the more\nengaging and impressive;\ndefinitely worth the extra\nbattery drain.\nUnfortunately all great\nthings must come to an end\nand the same is true for the\n3DS. People predict that it\nhas another year or so to go\nbefore Nintendo decide to\nmove on. What comes next\nis anyone\u2019s guess. A lot of\npeople are looking at the\nSwitch as the successor, which\ncould be possible, but right\nnow, it\u2019s still too early to tell.\nMaybe we\u2019ll get a slimmer\nversion of the Switch in the\nfuture because at the moment,\nit\u2019s a little too big and clunky\nand not exactly pocket size.\nOn the other hand, we could\nget a console that\u2019s a sequel\nto the 3DS. What\u2019s unique\nabout the 3DS and the DS\nis that they both have dual\nscreens, so trying to adapt\nthe gameplay of certain titled\nto the single-screened Switch\nwould take some work. Only\nNintendo can answer these\nquestions, it\u2019s just a matter of\nwhen; maybe E3 will reveal\nsome secrets.\nHaving said that, I still\nbelieve the 3DS is a worthwhile investment. You still\nhave access to a large variety\nof games which stand their\nground for the next couple\nof years. With portability,\nyou also have the freedom\nof gaming wherever you are,\neven when you should be\npaying attention in a lecture.\nThe 3DS isn\u2019t just the portable\nconsole of its generation, it\u2019s\nThe great age of the 3DS\n\\\\ With just over\n1000 titles, there\nare multiple\nopportunities for\nyou to entertain\nyourself \\\\\ndays, and mobile games\ndon\u2019t even come close to\nmeeting the phenomenon that\nis the 3DS. It has a large and\nstable fanbase and its market\ndominance has been absolute\nfor the past few years.\nThings weren\u2019t always\nsuccessful however, and early\nreception was poor to put it\npolitely. When it first came\nout, all the way back in 2011,\nit\u2019s major selling point was\nthat it packed the 3D without\nthe need for 3D-glasses.\nThere weren\u2019t really any great\ngames on it at the time and\nthe 3D tidbit was all Nintendo\nhad going for it. Due to this, it\nwas overshadowed by other\nconsoles at the time and for\na long time, bought units lay\nSix years since the initial release and still going strong \\\\ Nintendo\na platform for gaming across\nthe ages and a means to play\nmany beloved titles from more\nthan three decades of gaming\nhistory while on the move.\nI know all this talk has probably whetted your gaming appetite, so next I\u2019ve prepared a list of\nrecommendations of what you should be playing on the 3DS. (If you don\u2019t see Pok\u00e9mon it\u2019s\nbecause I\u2019ve played and talked about it to death and maybe it\u2019s time to move on)\nTheLegendofZelda:ALink\nBetween Worlds\nWith Ocarina of Time and Majora\u2019s Mask\nbeing remakes of old titles, A Link Between\nWorlds was the first original Zelda title\non the 3DS and boy, did it deliver. It is\nan amazing production that is lovingly\ncrafted with nostalgia from previous\ngames and built to perfectly fit the specifications of the 3DS. It makes a great use\nof the 3D and has enough new features\nto make it look exquisite. While most\nLegend of Zelda games are a little more\nhardcore and are for the serious gamers,\nthis game reminds you to have fun again and\nmarvel at beautiful sceneries.\nPhoenix Wright: Dual\nDestinies\nOne-half detective game and one-half visual\nnovel, Dual Destinies tells the story of defence\nattorney Phoenix Wright and his subordinates Apollo and Athena (I\u2019m not kidding,\nthese are the characters\u2019 actual names)\nas they get involved in all sorts of adventures in the name of justice. This game\nis a good entry point into the series as\nno prior knowledge is necessary. It\u2019s a\nbit light on action but it\u2019s worth playing\nif you\u2019re a wannabe detective, anim\u00e9\nfan, someone who likes jokes and/or a\nhawk-enthusiast (Play the game, it\u2019ll make\nsense)\nLuigi\u2019s Mansion: Dark\nMoon\nIt\u2019d be a disservice not to mention a\nMario game on this list but I\u2019m going\nto go with a spin-off title as opposed\nto a main series game. This game\nwill make you laugh as you control\nMario\u2019s lesser known, skinnier and\nyounger brother Luigi and basically\nbecome a ghostbuster. Beyond that,\nit has a nice multiplayer mode as well\nas some cool features that make this a\nfun enjoyable experience. It\u2019s nice to see\nLuigi stand on his feet and be resourceful\nin taking down ghosts as opposed to playing\nsecond fiddle to Mario like he usually does.\nSuper Smash Bros.\nSuper Smash Brothers is one the most popular fighting game franchises of all time and\none which everyone has heard of. The\nfact that its latest entry was released\non the 3DS makes it all the better.\nThe newest addition to the Smash\nBros family introduces several new\nplayers and stages, while taking the\nseries to new heights and reworking\nits competitive edge. Admittedly,\nthere\u2019s not much in single player\nmode so this is a game best served to\nmultiple people. Just make sure they\u2019re\non the same level of skill as you, otherwise\nit quickly becomes you losing immediately and\nwatching the other players fight for half an\nhour.\nProfessor Layton and the\nAzran Legacy\nThis is the sixth entry in the Professor\nLayton series, but one that\u2019s written so\nyou can enjoy it with no prior knowledge of the others. Professor Layton\nis a series that is less about frantic\nbutton mashing and more about\nusing your head to solve puzzles and\nmove the story forward. This game\nfeatures a rich world, full of colourful\ncharacters, and offers lots of things to do\nand even more player choice regarding in\nwhat order you do them. If you want to take\nthings easy and like to actually think before\nyou jump, this is the game for you.\nFire Emblem: Awakening\nThe Fire Emblem series was on its way out\nand it looked like only a miracle could save\nthe franchise. And indeed a miracle\nhappened, and its name was Awakening. This sequel combined features\nfrom old games while streamlining\neverything to make it suitable\nfor newcomers. It is an amazing\nturn-based, tactical game with a\ngameplay that gets you thinking\nand a well-written story that keeps\nyou engrossed. It\u2019s battle mechanics are addicting and personally I\nthink Awakening is the perfect game\nto bring in new fans and remind old\nplayers why they love the series so much.\n\\\\ Capcom\n\\\\ Level-5\n\\\\ Ichijinsha\n\\\\ Bandai Namco\n\\\\ Next Level Games\n\\\\ Nintendo\n\n"

Be there\nin their sleep. Be ever present, oppressive with love\nand undesired affection.\nBe a dick\nPiss off their housemates so much that\ntheir friends insist\nthat they break up\nwith you. Force their\nhand. Tommy and\nGina never back\ndown. Unfortunately\nit could backfire,\nand you could be\ncoerced into getting\na love pad. Avoid at\nall costs.\nBe extremely clingy\nChange their contact name on your phone to\n\u201cThe One\u201d. Show them. Look proud. You\u2019re\ntrying to freak them out with emotional prox-imity. You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve succeeded if you can\nsee the terror in their eyes. If not, escalate.\nCreate false\nintimacy by\nsharing false\nsecrets\nLike maybe tell them about that\ntime you killed your ex\u2019s dog,\nbecause they were spending too\nmuch time together. That could be\nthem. You could be like Alex in\nFatal Attraction. Only your bond is\nimportant...\nThe long game\nIt\u2019s all backfired, and they\u2019re even\nmore in love with you now. Stop\ntrying, you\u2019re clearly meant to be.\nIf you don\u2019t manage to kill your\nrelationship, marriage probably\nwill, so get out there and start\nshopping for engagement rings.\nThe sooner you get this over with,\nthe sooner you can get divorced\nand finally be free. You might need\na child or two to drive them away\nbut that\u2019s what boarding schools\nare for.\nThe high stakes play\nIt\u2019s now or never, book a really extravagant holiday six months in the future. Once\nthere\u2019s no chance that you\u2019ll get your money\nback, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that you will\nbreak up. Hopefully, by the time you\u2019re\nready to hit Hawaii you\u2019ll be single and\nready to mingle.\nThe reverse ghost\nConstantly call and text them,\nand ask why they\u2019re not calling\nyou back. Feign being ghosted.\nDemand to know why they\u2019re\nghosting you! It\u2019s your life, how\ncould they do such a thing?!\nSwamp their\nsocial media\nThis is for the ones who\u2019ve stood\ntheir ground. Start taking loads\nof photos of them sleeping and\npost them on Facebook. Caption\nthem, \u201cI wish you were here.\nCloser. Inside me.\u201d Yeah we\ndon\u2019t know either, you freak.\nGet a tattoo of their\nname on your body\nShow them your new tattoo. Repeatedly. Show their friends. Show their\nmum. Don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s not a real\ntattoo, it\u2019s a transfer tattoo, obviously.\nYou\u2019re not an idiot, you don\u2019t really\nlove them. There\u2019s only space for one\nman on your skin and that\u2019s Jon Bon\nJovi. You ain\u2019t gonna live forever, so\nthis relationship needs to die. Now.\nCool things\ndown\nForget your anniversary,\ntheir birthday, maybe even\ntheir name for a second\nthere. Keep reminiscing\nabout things you didn\u2019t do\nwith them. \u201cRemember when\nwe went to M&M World?\nOh wait no that wasn\u2019t with\nyou\u201d. Ask them how many\nsiblings they have at least\ntwice a week. And always\nmake their tea wrong.\nUse all the clich\u00e9s\nThey will have never heard them before\nbecause they are Imperial students and it\u2019s\nunlikely that they will have had an extensive\nlove life. But flip them round for clarity. You\ndon\u2019t still want to be friends, it really is them,\nnot you. You did mean to hurt them, and\nyou will love again soon you\u2019re sure.\nThe fake cheat\nManufacture a scenario where they find\nyou cheating on them (possibly using the\nfriend finder app). If they\u2019re not the snoopy\ntype you\u2019ll have to get creative. Pay someone to throw their drink in your face at a\nrestaurant in front of your partner, saying\nsomething like \u201cYou said she was fat and\nugly!\u201d. Hopefully you\u2019ll shortly get another\ndrink thrown in your face.\nThe unwelcome guest\nMake them really unwelcome in your space. If they\u2019re\nallergic to cats, get a cat. If they\u2019re not allergic to cats, get\na mean cat that likes to bite. It sounds like a lot of effort but\nmaybe your pet will end up being a social media star and\nyou can be a full time YouTuber. Then you\u2019ll definitely be\nbroken up with.\nSpread the love\nKeep saying you want to open\nup the relationship. Tell them,\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s\na finite amount of love that I\ncan give\u201d. Unless you\u2019re poly,\nin which case you\u2019re probably\nalready so used to communicating that this whole thing really\nought not to be a problem.\nKeep pushing for a threesome\nwith their hot best friend. They\u2019ll\neither oblige or refuse, which\nyou can use later. It\u2019s a win-win\nsituation. Once they agree to\nthe threesome, have the three-some, and then dump them\nimmediately after because you\nthink they\u2019re cheating on you\nwith the other person.\nJust ghost them\nIf they persist, change your\nnumber. If they show up at your\nflat or your department, move\nhouse, transfer universities, burn\noff your fingerprints and start a\nnew life in suburban Spain. You\u2019re\nAlex Macgee now. Embrace it.\nProve their friends right\nThey were warned by their friends about you,\nnow it\u2019s time to prove them right. Spread rumours\nabout your own infidelity. Then lie, say you\u2019ve\nbeen cheating on them for months. Lying to them\nis kinder than being honest with them: they\u2019ve\ntaken such a toll on your appearance and street\ncred that no one could possibly want you, and\nof course there\u2019s not someone else. All you want\nreally is to sit at home in your underwear eating\nBen and Jerry\u2019s straight from the carton and\nmasturbating over that hot girl from Biology\u2019s\nInstagram. Why can\u2019t you just be alone?!\nIt\u2019s time to talk about your\nfeelings. Just do it somewhere public. Maybe on a\nbus. Right as they\u2019re getting\noff.\nOr, fake your own\ndeath.\nFailing all that, send them this flowchart from felix. You\u2019re welcome.\n2 3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nThe\nfinal choice\nIf they resist breaking up with you despite all\nthese measures, you need to do something drastic. The\nfact alone that they still want to be with you\nmeans they\u2019re a sociopath and you\nneed to end this relationship fast.\nYou\nhave two\noptions\nObviously the grown up thing to do is sit them\ndown and have a conversation with them, but you\u2019re not\nready for that. You\u2019re a pathetic excuse for a human being,\nand you forgot to pack your spine when you were\nmoving into halls. You\u2019ve chosen to go down\nthe route of making them break up\nwith you. Nice job.\nS\nC\nA\nL\nA\nT\nE\nY\nI N\nT\nE\nN\nS\nI F\nLet us help\nE\nLef Tessa\nBOOM\n\n"

Only my girlfriend came over and saw them\nand got really jealous (she\u2019s a dom top).\nMy housemate only got them because they were reduced to\nsomething like 50p but this innocent gesture has now sparked\na diplomatic incident.\nI\u2019m pretty sure the girlfriend is going to \u2018surprise\u2019 me with\na massive bouquet tomorrow (obviously hers have to be\nbigger) which is great, only I\u2019m actually allergic to flowers.\nAlso I\u2019m afraid she might hurt my housemate. Maybe set fire\nto our flat. Out of love.\nSuggestions?\nBest,\nViv\nDamn,\nNothing makes my day like advice on how\nto deal with a good dom top. I have to say, I\ndon\u2019t know who you are Vivien but it sounds\nlike you\u2019re loving it. And you should. Being in\na relationship with a dom top is like having\nto care for a chocolate covered puppy. That\u2019s\nalso covered in nails. Some of which carry\nhepatitis. But if you can navigate straight to\nthe gooey centre you\u2019ll never want out again.\nSo let\u2019s see. Your daddy is jelly. Good.

Within\nhours, Elon Musk had\nresigned from the President\u2019s\nBoard of Advisors, American\nstates such as California went\nrogue and protested the\nmove, vouching to uphold\ntheir commitment anyway,\nand world leaders expressed\ntheir disappointment and their\ndetermination to do their bit\nfor the planet.\nSurprisingly, Trump\u2019s war\non sustainability seems to\nhave united almost everyone\nelse against him. The acting\nhead of the US embassy in\nBeijing resigned over his\ncountry\u2019s withdrawal from\nthe Paris climate change\naccord. France, Germany\nand Italy penned a joint letter\ncondemning Trump\u2019s decision\n(Theresa May reportedly\ndeclined to co-sign the\nstatement). By Monday over\n1,000 mayors, governors\nand companies in the US\nhad expressed defiance to\nWashington.\nAnd yes, even North Korea\ncalled out the decision,\nbranding it \u201cshort-sighted and\nsilly\u201d.\nClimate change is rightfully\nthe hottest topic of discussion\nat the moment, so we talked\nto some of Imperial\u2019s leading\nscientists to see what they\u2019re\nmaking of this turn of events.\nAnd what better place to\nfind them than the Grantham\nInstitute.\nThe Grantham Institute does\nmultidisciplinary research,\nengaging with staff and\nstudents across College\ninterested in climate change.\nJo Haigh is one of the institute\u2019s\nCo-Directors and has notably\ncontributed to (and lead\nauthored) several reports of\nthe Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change, and was\nmore than happy to discuss\nrecent developments. The Paris\nAccord was a triumph that not\nonly surprised everyone at\nthe time but keeps pleasantly\nsurprising scientists across the\nglobe.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how\nfantastic it was, because\nprevious to that we had the\nCopenhagen meeting which\nwas such a disappointment,\u201d\nsays Haigh. \u201cWe were all\nhoping there\u2019d be a climate\nagreement and it got\nabsolutely nowhere. This\ntime round we were thinking\nif they can just agree on\nanything it will be so good.\nAnd not only did they have\na unanimous agreement but\nthey agreed to try and limit\nglobal temperature increase\nto less than two degrees\nabove pre-industrial [levels] or\npreferably 1.5 degrees. This\nwas signed up and agreed\nand then less than a year later\nit got ratified. I think this is the\nfastest any treaty has been\nratified through the United\nNations.\u201d\nThe Paris Agreement\nis based on voluntary\ncontributions to reducing\nCO2 emissions. It has been\ncriticised for not providing a\nlegal framework for keeping\nthe international community\nin check. Realistically, even\nif signatories fulfilled their\npledges, we would be\nnowhere near hitting the two\ndegree target. But that\u2019s not\nthe point. (Besides, there are\nmechanisms for reassessing\ngoals and moving action\nforward every five years). The\nsuccess of the Paris agreement\nlies in the declaration of\nglobal intent to do something\nabout climate change and the\nexit of a major player like the\nUSA jeopardises the spirit of\nunity.\n\u201cThe USA is estimated to be\ncontributing nearly 20% of\nthe world\u2019s CO2 emissions.\nPulling out is no minor\nevent. The thought that the\nUS wouldn\u2019t do anything to\nmitigate climate change is\nbad in itself but it could also\nbe bad in the sense that other\ncountries might think likewise\n\u2013 if they\u2019re not doing it, why\nwould we bother \u2013 and the\nwhole thing could unravel.\u201d\nAlyssa Gilbert, Head of\nPolicy and Translation at the\nGrantham Institute, agrees. \u201cA\nlot needs to be done locally.\nThe issue is that you need\neveryone to agree that we\nneed to make an effort. That\u2019s\nwhy we have these\nbig international\nagreements. We all\nneed to play our\npart, which is why\nthe US detaching\nis distressing.\u201d\nGilbert\u2019s role bridges the\nwork and knowledge of\nacademic researchers and\nthe action stakeholders who\nmake decisions that impact\nthe environment, such as\nNGOs and governmental\nbodies. Gilbert essentially\nensures that the science is\neffectively communicated\nto the public and translated\ninto policy. Which begs the\nquestion: What motivated\nTrump\u2019s decision? Was it a\ncommunication failure?\nGilbert doesn\u2019t think so.\n\u201cIn no time in his speech\nabout leaving the Paris\nAgreement did Donald\nTrump say anything skeptical\nabout climate change.\nWhether that\u2019s because he\u2019s\na climate skeptic remains\nto be seen but the bit of the\nstory that\u2019s telling us what the\nscience says about the world\naround us seems to have had\nquite a significant message\ndelivery over time.\u201d\nIndeed, not only has\nscientific evidence for global\nclimate change been piling\nup over the last decades,\nsome effects are frankly\nimpossible to ignore, such\nas the very measurable one\ndegree increase in average\nglobal temperatures since the\nbeginning of the conversation.\nGilbert thinks climate-skepticism is not really the\nissue anymore, instead the\nreal challenge is in convincing\npeople that\nu r g e n t\naction\ni s\n\\\\ Surprisingly,\nTrump\u2019s war on\nsustainability seems\nto have united\nalmost everyone\nelse against him \\\\\n\\\\ The issue is that\nyou need everyone\nto agree that we\nneed to make an\neffort. That\u2019s why\nwe have these\nbig international\nagreements. We all\nneed to play our\npart, which is why\nthe US detaching is\ndistressing \\\\\nFuck this guy // Gage Skidmore\n\n"

When diesel is\nburnt it releases tiny nanoparticles called polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons\n(PAHs), which easily enter our\nairways.\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially because of\ntheir small size that they can\nbe inhaled,\u201d explains Lareb\nDean, a PhD researcher from\nImperial\u2019s National Heart and\nLung Institute. \u201cInhalation is\nour primary interest as respiratory scientists \u2013 clearance\nmechanisms exist in the upper\nairways but because of their\nsmall size, density and shape,\nnanoparticles are able to go\nthrough the lungs and reach\nperipheral areas like the\nalveoli. Then we have these\nquestions of whether they are\nable to translocate to other\nareas of the body.\u201d\nExactly how nanoparticles\nlike PAHs behave in the\nhuman body is of growing\nconcern to scientists. \u201cWith\nthings like asbestos we found\nout too late what the effect\nwas,\u201d says Dean, \u201cwe need\nto do studies to carry out risk\nassessment for the potential\neffects of chronic exposure to\nother nanoparticles.\u201d\nThe new finding emphasises\nthe need to address the worrying levels of air pollution in\nbig cities in order to protect\npublic health. \u201cPeople with\npre-existing lung disorders\nare most at risk,\u201d says Dean,\n\u201cparticularly people with\nasthma and COPD (chronic\nobstructive pulmonary dis-ease), as well as people that\nare occupationally exposed\nto diesel fumes, like lorry\ndrivers.\u201d\nLucy Gumbiti-Zimuto,\na medical student at the\nUniversity of Cambridge, has\nbeen suffering from asthma\nfor the past 12 years. \u201cI\u2019ve\nhad asthma since I was 10,\u201d\nshe says, \u201cI have noticed that\nwhen I come to London, or\nI\u2019ve been in London for a few\ndays especially, I get more\nasthmatic, develop a slight\ncough and have to use my\ninhaler more often.\u201d UK air\nquality is currently very poor;\nin fact pollution levels in cities\nlike London and Birmingham\nare technically illegal according to standards set out by the\nEU. The government recently\npublished new plans to tackle\nair pollution but these have\nbeen criticised for being too\nweak.\n\u201cI am concerned about\nhigh pollution as my asthma\nisn\u2019t that bad so people\nwho have it worse must get\nreally bad symptoms,\u201d says\nGumbiti-Zimuto, \u201cit worries\nme not only for my health but\nfor everyone else\u2019s \u2013 it might\ncause increases in things like\nlung cancer.\u201d\n\u201cIt concerns me,\u201d adds\nDean, \u201cbecause my research,\nas well as the body of literature out there, has shown that\nincreases in particulate matter\nlike diesel exhaust leads to an\nincrease in mortality risk. The\nepidemiological evidence is\nreally robust.\u201d\nAs well as exacerbating\nconditions like asthma, PAHs\nare known to cause cancer.\nSo why is diesel still being\nburnt? The government is\nunder pressure to implement\ncharges on diesel cars entering cities but is reluctant to do\nso having previously encouraged drivers to purchase\nthem due to lower carbon\ndioxide emissions. To combat\nthe issue, legal activist group\nClientEarth will take the\ngovernment to court to challenge its failure to effectively\naddress the UK\u2019s air pollution\ncrisis so far.\nF\nact: Hot water\nfreezes faster than\ncold water.\nOnce upon a time,\nErasto Mpemba was\nmaking ice cream in\nhis cookery class. The sign of\na good scientist? He noticed\nthatthemixfrozefasterifitwas\nhot, rather than just eating it.\nFirst observed in the\n1960s, this experiment has\nbeen repeated many times\nsince but, despite gallons of\nwarm ice cream, a satisfying explanation remained\nelusive. As such, this phenomenon has remained\na mystery \u2013 until now.\nTime to get molecular:\nWater is H2\nO \u2013 one oxygen\nand two hydrogen atoms held\ntogether by covalent bonds.\nThe different water molecules\nare attracted to each other by\nhydrogen bonding. Now, Mr\nXi Zhang has recently proposed that when the water\nmolecules are pulled together\nby hydrogen bonding, their\ncovalent bonds stretch, which\nstores energy. So, when the\nwater is heated, and the water\nmolecules move further apart,\nthose same covalent bonds\ncan relax, which releases\nenergy. And releasing energy\nis the same as cooling.\nThis alternative cooling\nmechanism works in addition\nto normal cooling, and when\nyou do the maths, that turns\nout to perfectly explain our\nice cream mystery. It may\nseem counter-intuitive, but in\na cocktail-party emergency\nyou\u2019re better off sticking warm\nwater in your ice cube tray.\nThis one was a bit too \u2018science\u2019 \u2013 don\u2019t worry, next\nweek we\u2019re back to sex.\nAnother one of Mr Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nIce,Ice\nBaby\nRachel Baxter explores new research conducted by Imperial researchers\nthat identifies exactly how the diesel pollution that hangs in our air may\nbe affecting our health\n\\\\ David Holt\nof devices directly on your\nbody to achieve super-human\ncapabilities, it\u2019s not really so\nscience fiction anymore,\u201d he\nsays.\nKevin Warwick, former\nProfessor of Cybernetics at\nthe University of Reading,\nsupports the idea of enhancing human capabilities using\ntechnology. Warwick became\nthe world\u2019s first cyborg when,\nin 1998, he implanted a\nmicrochip under the skin of his\nforearm which enabled him\nto remotely control devices\nin the room.

Scientists have\ncreated a 3D printed \u2018bionic\nskin\u2019 which could give robots\nthe sense of touch. This is a\nmajor step towards printing\nelectronics onto human skin.\nCyborgs, part human part\nmachine, are no longer\nconfined to science fiction.\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have\ndeveloped a revolutionary\nprocess for making stretcha-ble electronic sensory devices\nusing a unique, custom-built\n3D printer. \u201cA 3D printer is\ntypically used to print hard\nplastic objects \u2013 we want\nto go beyond hard plastics\nto the realm of functional\nmaterials and devices, such\nas electronic and biological materials,\u201d explains\nlead researcher Michael\nMcAlpine, an associate\nprofessor of mechanical\nengineering.\nSo far, the scientists have\nprinted 3D touch sensors\nonto a model hand. The next\nstep is to integrate these into\ntools on a monitor, you could\nactually give doctors a sense\nof touch, allowing them to do\nmore accurate surgery,\u201d says\nMcAlpine.\nThe researchers also integrated a 3D printed sensory\ndevice onto real human skin\nand found that it was sensitive\nenough to measure pulse. This\npaves the way for 3D printing\nwearable health monitoring\ndevices.\n3D printed electronic\ndevices could become \u201cthe\ntattoos of the 21st\ncentury\u201d,\nsays Andy Miah, a fellow of\nthe Institute for Ethics and\nEmerging Technologies, USA.\nYet Miah is sceptical about\ntheir usefulness for daily life.\n\u201cHaving something stuck to\nyou on a permanent basis\nwould be quite limiting,\u201d he\nsays. However, there is more\nwork to be done before\ndevices can be 3D printed\ndirectly onto the human body.\n\u201cOne of the key things in\nbeing able to print on a real\nhuman hand is being able\nto track the small movements of the hand,\u201d explains\nMcAlpine. \u201cWe\u2019re developing\nalgorithms now that can track\n\\\\ In the future, you\ncould take the average person and give\nthem an enhanced\nsense of touch\\\\\nmotion; I think we\u2019re close\nto being able to put this 3D\nprinting device to practical\nuse and we\u2019re pretty excited\nabout it,\u201d he says.\nThe researchers say the\npossible uses for 3D printed\ndevices are endless. They\ncould be used by soldiers in\nthe field to detect dangerous\nchemicals or explosives. They\ncould be used to develop new\ntherapies for people who\nhave lost their sense of touch,\nsuch as leprosy sufferers.\n\u201cPeople wear smart\nwatches on their wrist now\nand that gives them extra\ncapabilities \u2013 you have the\nwhole world\u2019s information on\nyour wrist,\u201d says McAlpine.\n\u201cTaking that a step further\nand integrating other types\n\\\\ Shuang-Zhuang Guo & Michael McAlpine\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\\\\ Kevin Warwick, the \u201cliving cyborg\u201d with his wife\n\\\\ 3D printed devices could become the\ntattoos of the 21st\ncentury \\\\\nrobots to give them a sense of\ntouch. \u201cYou could integrate it\ninto surgical robots.

After doing\nhis best to rid the US of \u2018bad\nhombres\u2019, last Thursday\nhe proceeded to attack\nanother of his enemies \u2013 the\nenvironment \u2013 by announcing\nthe withdrawal of the US\nfrom the Paris agreement.\nThe withdrawal process is\nexpected to take four years,\nbut has already invoked a\nlarge outcry from scientists\neverywhere. Read below for\na full analysis for some of the\nquestions and answers of what\nthe deal is, why Trump pulled\nout and the repercussions this\nhas.\n\\\\ The US stands alongside\nonly two other countries\nworldwide in not supporting\nthe deal \\\\\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nas soon as possible. Trump\nreferred to the deal as\n\u2018draconian\u2019, which hardly\nseems fair for an agreement\nthat is, by definition, non-binding and in which each\ncountry plans its own\ncontribution to the combined\nattempt to mitigate global\nwarming.\nWhy is Trump pulling out?\nTrump claims to have pulled\nout of Paris \u201cIn order to fulfil\n[his] solemn duty to protect\nAmerica and its citizens\u201d.\nHe has repeatedly dismissed\nclimate change as a hoax,\nconcocted by scientists and the\nChinese (the blame has shifted\nbetween the two at different\npoints in time) to undercut US\nmanufacturing and his much-loved oil and gas industries.\nHe did, at the same time, try to\nreassure us in his speech that\nhe \u201cstill cares deeply about\nclimate change\u201d. There\u2019s some\nTrump logic for you. As a result\nthe US, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter of greenhouse\ngases, stands alongside only\ntwo other countries worldwide\nin not supporting the deal\n\u2013 Syria, immersed in a civil\nwar, and Nicaragua, which\nWhat has the response been\nso far?\nTrump\u2019s decision has proven\nto be largely unpopular.\nAccording to the Yale\nprogram on climate change\ncommunication, 69% of all\nAmericans were in favour\nof remaining in the deal.\nBarack Obama, under whose\nadministration the US spent\nyears negotiating the Paris\nAgreement, has criticised this\nmove as an abdication of US\nleadership on the global scale.\n61 US mayors have said that\nthey will work independently\nto adopt the Paris accord\nand sent a letter to Trump\nsaying \u201cIf the president wants\nto break the promises made\nto our allies\u2026 we\u2019ll build\nand strengthen relationships\naround the world to protect\nthe climate from devastating\nclimate risks\u201d. The Pittsburgh\nmayor is a personal favourite.\nAfter Trump stated that he had\nbeen \u201celected to represent\nthe citizens of Pittsburgh, not\nParis\u201d the mayor replied with\nthe statement \u201cwe stand with\nthe world and will follow the\nagreement\u201d. Furthermore,\nglobal business leaders such\nas Elon Musk and leaders of\ncompanies such as Google,\nApple and hundreds of others\nincluding major fossil fuel\nproducers such as Exxon\nMobil have urged Trump to\nstay in the Paris agreement,\nwith Musk even quitting\nTrump\u2019s advisory board\naltogether\nWhat will the withdrawal\nmean?\nThere is no doubt that\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal will make\nit more difficult for the world\nto reach the goals that it set\nout to achieve in the Paris\nAgreement, given that the US\nis the second-largest emitter\nof greenhouse gases, and has\nalso been a leader in financing\nand providing technological\nexpertise in carbon-reducing\nmeasures.\n\\\\ 61 US mayors\nhave said they will\nwork independently\nto adopt the Paris\naccord \\\\\nWhat is the Paris Climate\nDeal ?\nThe Paris Agreement is\nan agreement within the\nUnited Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate\nChange, signed in 2015 by\n195 countries, which sets\na global goal of keeping\naverage global temperatures\nfrom rising 2\u00b0C, compared\nto pre-industrial levels, by the\nend of the century. Its aim is\nfor countries to reduce their\nbelieves the deal does not do\nenough for climate change.\n\\\\ The Environmental\nAgency's policies\nare still largely\nintact, so it looks\nlike US citizens will\nat least be able to\nenjoy clean air until\nTrump decides that's\na hoax too \\\\\nTrump has said he is willing\nto \u201cbegin negotiations\u201d for\nthe US to rejoin the Paris\nAgreement, or a different\nclimate agreement, on\ndifferent terms that are \u201cfairer\nto the US\u201d, but it remains\nunclear what these are. In the\nmeantime, the EU and China\nare expected to move forward\nas leaders in clean energy\nand the fight against climate\nchange. On a lighter note, it is\nlikely that the energy future of\nthe US will not be as coal-filled\nas one could imagine, due to\nthe falling prices of renewable\nenergy technologies and the\nrising prowess of shale gas.\nThe Environmental Agency\u2019s\npolicies are, for the moment,\nstill largely intact (sigh of\nrelief), so it looks like US\ncitizens will at least be able\nto enjoy clean air until Trump\ndecides that that\u2019s a hoax too.\nAll in all, this withdrawal\nseems like just another\nindication of the scary way in\nwhich major world powers are\nlooking inwards, rather than\noutwards, home rather than\nabroad, and looking to make\ntheir own countries prosper\nrather than considering\ninternational goals. It is now\ntime for the rest of the world\nto rise up to the climate\nchallenge, with or without the\nUS. The Earth clock is ticking\nand the effects of carbon\nemissions don\u2019t care much for\nnegotiation.\nDefeating ISIS\nis impossible.\nDealing with\nthem is not\nCharles Titmuss thinks that in order\nto combat terrorism, we must first\nunderstand its root causes\nT\nhe UK has been\nsubjected to a\nnumber of terrorist\nacts. At this point in\ntime it is appropriate\nto mourn and honour\nthe dead and remember that\nnothing can justify these acts.\nAt the same time, it is important\nto look at this topic with nuance\nif we as a nation wish to solve\nthis problem. Two questions\nneed to be answered: what\nare the driving factors behind\nthese attacks, and what can\nbe done to reduce the impact\nthat terrorism can have on our\ndaily lives? The emphasis in\nthis article will be on Islamist\nterrorism.\n\\\\ Deportations and snap-imprisonment of those willing\nto commit terrorist acts may\nnot be the best course of\naction \\\\\ninternet, as well as proximity\nto other people sharing\nthe same views, can serve\nto entrench these feelings.\nThese feelings then need to\nbe inserted into a context to\nprovide direction and purpose\nfor their hatred. Islamism is\nrooted in Wahhabism or Jihadi\nSalafism, which preaches,\namongst other things, that the\nWest is fundamentally evil and\nmust be destroyed in order to\nreplace it with a version more\nin accordance with their ideas\nof absolute good. Proximate\nexamples such as the Iraq\nwar or bombing in Syria are\noften used in order to further\njustify the use of violence in\naccomplishing their goals.\nTherefore, looking to the\nfuture, these attacks are likely\nto continue, for a range of\nreasons. Anger at certain\nelements of UK foreign policy\nis unlikely to dissipate. It has\nbeen cast, incorrectly, as a war\non Islam by Islamist preachers\nand with the current instability\nin the Middle East, some form\nof UK military commitment to\nthe region is likely for a long\nperiod of time.\nSecondly, there is the\npresence of radical Sheikhs\nand militant groups that\npreach hatred of the West.\nThese personas are easy to\naccess on the internet and\noften preach around the UK\nin order to recruit vulnerable\npeople to their cause.\nMilitant groups especially,\nbut also some preachers,\nrely heavily on funding from\nstates in the Middle East. A\nrecent report commissioned\nby the Home Office looking\ninto Saudi funding of\nterrorist organisations was\ncontroversially buried as\nit contained potentially\ndiplomatically damaging\ninformation about Saudi\nactivities. Qatar recently had\ndiplomatic relations severed\nwith several different Middle\nEastern states over its role in\nfunding this form of terrorism.\nThe preaching of Wahhabi\nand Salafist Jihadi movements\nis also unlikely to go away any\ntime soon.\nThe economic and social\nfactors that begin the path\nto radicalisation will also\nprove difficult to remedy. In a\nworld of rising inequality, it is\npossible that these problems\nwill only increase, and lead\nmade by all political parties.\nPersonally I believe that a\nrange of approaches are\nnecessary in order to lessen\nthe possible impact Islamic\nextremism can have on the\nUK.\nFirstly, efforts need to be\nmade to restrict Wahhabi and\nSalafist Jihadi movements and\nthe funding that they receive.\nThe repressed report should\nbe published and acted\nupon to disrupt the powerful\nindividuals that wish to spread\nviolence around the world.\nSecondly, more community\npolicing and engagement\nis required. This is vital as it\nwould help provide a counter\nnarrative to that provided by\nextremist preachers, and help\nprotect vulnerable individuals.\nA significant amount of\nradicalisation occurs within\nthe community, and a wedge\nmust be driven between those\nwho preach extremism and\nintolerance and the rest of\nsociety. Deportations and\nsnap-imprisonment of those\nwilling to commit terrorist acts\nmay not be the best course\nof action as this could serve\nto radicalise more people,\nas well as reducing the time\ntaken to commit attacks.\nThe controversial Prevent\nprogramme must be fully\nfunded, and better integrated\ninto communities.\nFunding for the security\nservices should be increased,\nbut their powers for\nsurveillance should not. I am of\nthe opinion that they possess\nthe appropriate tools, but\nnot the means. An emphasis\non the role of the internet in\nradicalising individuals should\nbe avoided. While it is a\ncritical battleground, social\nmedia companies do not host\nthat much extremist content, as\n\\\\ In a world of\nrising inequality, it is\npossible that these\nproblems will only\nincrease \\\\\nIn order for terrorism to be\nenacted it is first necessary\nto radicalise individuals.\nRadicalisation can take place\nfor a whole range of reasons.\nThe first requirement is often a\nsense of social and economic\nisolation and exclusion. This\ncan take the form of relative\npoverty, or suffering from\nracism and discrimination.\nThis leads to resentment and\nanger directed towards the\nsociety in which they are\nliving, and is a critical primer\nto radicalisation. Interactions\nwith extremist content on the\nto a greater amount of anger\nfrom those communities that\ndo not feel the economic\nbenefit and remain excluded\nfrom society. It is worth noting\nthat these feelings of anger\nonly make people vulnerable\nto extremism, and in no way\njustify extremist actions.\nHaving ascertained that this\nproblem is not going away,\nwhat can be done to lessen\nthe impact or even remedy\nit? Suggestions have been\nmost has moved to places such\nas Telegram. A recent report\nby the BBC into IS militants\nfound that a significant\nproportion were radicalised\nby local preachers.\nI believe that these efforts\nwould reduce the risk to the\npublic. We must not descend\ninto hysteria, we must remain\ncalm and remember that this\nevil ideology will not defeat\nus.\n\\\\ A wedge must\nbe driven between\nthose who preach\nextremism and\nintolerance and the\nrest of society \\\\\n\n"
