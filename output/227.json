    "content": "10 FELIX Gutteridge Cup\nMOTSPUR\nHERE WE COME\nI.C.11C. E.M.3 by Bill Jenkins\nIt was a vocal, bloodthirsty and near alcoholic contingent of\nC.E.M. supporters who turned out at Harlington last Wednesday. A contingent who found themselves not only matched for support by\nan I.C. party under the mob rule of Ken West but steadily silence a as the I.C. fifteen quickly established their superiority and by virtue\nof an 11\u20143 win entered the final of the Gutteridge Cup for the first\ntime for five years.\nThe margin of this win could have,\nand should have, been much great-er. Howell once more dominated the tight but behind him things some-how went astray when some uncontrolled heeling together with a slow start by Smith was certainly not helped by aCS. M. back row who lived on or near the borderline of off-side.\nIn addition a strong cross field wind madeline outplay almost impossible and for the majority of the\nmatch three quarter movements\nwere few and far between.\nC.E.M. Weak\nRay, in spite of suffering several\nsevere knocks, played outstanding\ndriving on a park where And renon and Rogers on were ever prominent, while 'veteran' Place often ghosted\nfrom nowhere to join a passing\nmovement. Against them the C.E.M. showed little initiative; are mark that could also be applied to their\nthree qu at ers who rarely escaped\nthe I.C. defence and whose few dangerous moves came from opportunist moves.\nThe score opened when Ray kicked a ninth minute penalty for I.C.:a good effort from35 yd s. This was not improved upon before the\ninterval although one move saw C happel cross the line only to be called back for a previous in f ring ment. The remainder of this half was somewhat disjointed and devoid of incident unless one includes\na glorious attempted uppercut by one\nI.C. forward; unseen by the referee\nhut instantly spotted by his Australian boxing instructor.\nDuring the second half I.C. tightened their grip on the game, going\nfarther ahead with an early try. This score had its origin in a short penalty\nwhich triggered a move containing t wey directional sorties and with at\nleal t half the side handling. Then a kick ahead by Hills was gathered\nand passed via Cleary to prop forward And renon who covered the last\nten yards at a speed that would have\nbeen no disgrace to a back before\ncrossing some ten yards from the flag.\nAn excellent try converted with casual\nease by Ray. The writing was now clearly on the\nwall forC.E. M. and although they\nclosed the gap with a penalty, Ray took his points tally to eight by kicking an easy goal in front of the posts.\nVolleyball\nLEAGE FINALS\nONCE AGAIN the I.C. Volleyball the am beat opponents in\nmatches through the league, and\nreached the qu ater final. The\nother three teams to reach the\nqu ater finals of the competition\nwere Southgate Tech. Oast years\nS.E. champions), London Fire\nBrigade, and Borough Poly.\nIn the match against Borough Poly we had an easy victory by1511 and152. In the next match the college\nteam defeated the Fire Brigade who thought to be favourites to win the\nfinal. The I.C. forwards, Noel, Hara i and. Te mad, were too strong for the\nbrigade, their strong smashing over\nthe net proving un returnable. The final scores in this highly exciting match were 15-10 and157. This victory put I.C. into the final\nagainst a strong Southgate Tech. term. After a very exciting struggle I.C.t o:k the first game 15,-11, but the opp osi tion, whose team included two national players, took the final two games\nand won the match. This completed the scoring and although a difference of opinion between the college front row and the referee resulted in several more C.E.M. penalty attempts the exultant\nleaps of\" impartial\" touch judge\nBallard indicated that none was successful. S oI.C. move on to Mot spur Park on March5 th where the: final hurdle between them and the Cup will be\nprovided by the blue and purple jerseys of U.C. Boats\nOUT OF SEASON\nAT THIS time of the season the\nboat club does not race very often but our two novice crews took on two equivalent crews from Reading University over a mile on the Tide way. The first crew won their event by two lengths, but the second was not\nso fortunate and lost by a margin of about five lengths. It would seem that\nthere is a great disparity between\nthese two crews and, at this time of\nyear, it is strange that this should be\nso. The second crew lacks cohesion and the first crew's rhythm leaves\nsomething to be desired, but they do work together better than the second.\nThese faults must be straightened\nout before the Head of the River Race on March19, if the anticipated\nsuccesses are to be realised.\nWomen's Judo\nFIRST MATCH\nI.C. Judo Club women's section\nfought their first match last week and came home victorious. In a match at\nKing's the first team beat King's College10 pts to nil, and then went\non to beat the I.C. second team 17-10.\nIn the first team (Jiayne Vowles( Cpt), Ime ldi Wagner, Rita Gare pole) versus second (Judith Pearson (Cpt),\nValerie Smith, Jane Pearson) match Jmelda overpowered Jane with a Kes aGata me( scarf hold,) after attempting an arm lock. Then Judith defeated\nRita using Yoko Shih oGa tame( side-hold) bringing the match to a draw. The first couple then replayed and Jayne was successful with a left-handed TaiTo shi. After this as it\nproved' impossible to locate the King's bar the teams dashed back to I.C. to\nmake it before closing time. encyclopaedic Marconi\nElectronic and mechanical engineers,\ndesigners, system planners and nan u fact ur ers of telecommunications, broadcasting, maritime and aviation\nradio equipment; radar, television, specialized components, microelectronics, data processing equipment and navigational\naids on land, at sea and in the air\nThe Marconi Company Limited\nMARCONI HOUSE, CHELMSFORD, ESSEX.

However they held a considerable psychological advantage already having two single-goal\nvictories behind them.\nI.C. started by playing defensively\nbut this plan misfired as U.C. soon\nscored by a lobbed goal. In the\nsecond quarter the opponents, no doubt inspired by the Royal patron age, scored again to go 2-0 up. The college team then came out of their\ndefensive stupor and centre forward Ong fought hard to score I.C.'s first\ngoal and I.C. were now playing splendidly.

    "content": "6 FELLX\nFree Vote for President\nThe Case For\nBEFORE considering the advantages o( electing President of Imperial College\nUnion by popular vote, there are three\nimportant criticisms of the present\nevolutionary method. Firstly, the President who is elected by a meeting of joint\nCouncil must feel more responsible to\nthem than to the whole Union. This very\nindirect method of election means that the\nPresident seems far from the general body\nof the Union.\nsecondly this system of election tends to pro duce a President from the oligarchy which runs Imperial College Union. This is backed up by most Presidents evolving directly from Council and not from the Union. Because of this too many members of the Union do not know of the future President until they are presented to them. Thirdly, because of the system, candidates are\ndi sua ded from coming forward. It is a sorry state of affairs when Presidents are elected un opposed.\nUL U is a prime example of what happens\nwher i( he members of the UL U have hardly any say in the elections of the President and the rest\nof the executive. In order that IC does not degenerate as far as this, the President and Secretary\nof IC Union must be elected by a popular vote of\nthe Union members. The first advantage is that we would have a democratic system for choosing our most senior member. Secondly, and the more important reason,\nthe President would be responsible to the whole Union, who had elected him. Conversely the Union members would realise that the President more realistically represents tHem in his work within and outside IC. In order to persuade the majority of the Union to support them, the candidates would have to organise a campaign to make themselves known, to show their abilities and put forward their views to the whole Union. I doubt if any candidate\nwould be elected on grounds of emotion. In fact\npotential candidates who were not serious are\nmore likely to win over the relatively small Joint Council than the solid bulk of the Union. By exercising their vote to choose the senior\nmember of the Union, members of IC Union will be able to participate more in the Union when they realise they count and their vote counts. In\nthis way I think that the apathy which besets\nUnion activities could be curbed to the advantage\nof everyone.\nE. Fortune. And Against\nCreated issues and inter-collegiate strife.\nAre these teh grounds on which we want\nto elect the President of I.C. Union? Do\nwe want candidates to have to think u o slogans like \"Cheaper Moonev Meals\"\nthat are impossible to put into effect ? Do\nwe want the Mines vote to hold s wav over\nwhether we have a President from Guilds\nor RCS ?\nA free vote for Presidency does not necessarily\nmean that these would be the deciding points, but only if issues like these arose would it be any different from the present system, where the final\nchoice is made by Council \u2014 which is no mote of\na clique than the House of Commons. The nature of the office makes it essential that\nthe President is someone of proven administrative ability, with tft e respect of those with whom he\nmust work and those in authority, and with an intimate knowledge of the running of the Union. The present system ensures that the person who fulfils these conditions best will be elected.\nIt is said that a great advantage of the proposed\nchange is that popular Presidents will result. In theory this is an excellent point. But why are\npeople popular? Because of the above points?\nOr because \" he makes Constituent Union meetings a laugh\" or \" he is a good centre forward.\" To become popular candidates would be forced to\ncanvass intensively for two or three months before-hand. This would mean final year undergraduates\n(who are at present the majority of candidates)\nwould not be prepared to stand. Do we want a free vote with some of the best candidates unable\nto stand \u2014 resulting in, perhaps, only one candidate?\nDous al McCrea th( Civil Engineering PG) is an ex-President of the University of Manitoba in Canada. He was elected by a free vote but is not in favour of this method.\" Candidates are forced\nto make rash promises which they cannot keep. They have to manufacture reasons why they are\n' different'.\" He said also that nearly always the\nelection reduced to Arts versus the Sciences, with the former more successful through greater number s.He, as an engineer, belonged to a small faculty and would probably not have had a serious chance but for exam failures removing the two main contenders. Do we never want a President from Mines? People who suggest that the present arrange-ment is undemocratic would be better employed doing their stirring against the method of govern-ment in this country. As the past has shown, a PrimeMinister can stagger on, even when opinion polls clearly show his party's unpopularity. This we call democracy? A tI.C., if at anytime the President become unpopular, a success-ful motion of no confidence at a Union meeting will immediately cause his downfall. Here we\nhave total democracy because the Union is above\nthe President, who is only the chairman of Council. Earlier this year FELIX interviewed two hun dred people for a Kant a Poll. Over57 per cent\nhad not the vaguest idea what the main function of the President was. Should students be asked\nto vote for unknown candidates to fill an unknown post?\nWould you vote for the candidate you knew was best for the job or the candidate you knew? New Hostel for I.C. Two students are so fed up with the ac-como dati on problem in this area that\nthey have decided that it is time to do\nsomething about it. They propose to set\nup a self-governing student residence\nwhich would be similar in certain ways to\nan American Fraternity. It is proposed that\nit would be totally owned and administered b v the student residents although they\nwould like an affiliation with one of the\nAmerican fraternities, so that members of\ntheir fraternity in London would be able\nto stay at American ones, and vice versa,\nduring the summer vacations.\nOur more English readers might like a short account of the way in which the American system\noperates. The fraternity at the American University is a body of students who live together in a large house which is usually divided up into sleeping rooms, studying rooms and entertaining rooms. At the beginning of the year at the university the students visit the different fraternities and c tio Os e the one which they would like to belong to. Those that are selected from these applications are accepted on probation for six months. At the\nend of this period those that still wish to remain, have to be approved by the rest of the fraternity.\nOnce elected a person is a member for life.\nThe fraternities are usually members of chains which have units at different universities all over\nthe country. Some of them have odd names like\" OKU\" and others are weird cliques like\" WASP\" \u2014 White Anglo Saxon Protestants,\nand those which exist for. such things as wrestling club members. Any member of a chain may stay\nat any of the other fraternities that belong to the\nchain. It is hoped that any started here would not bec ome cliquish but it is an obvious trap that anybody electing his own successors could fall into. If anybody is interested in this scheme, and anyone with first hand knowledge of the operation\nof any such bodies, will they please get in touch with Robin Dibble e or Clinton Bur house.( Any notes sent to them through Felix Rae k Box No.227 b will be forwarded.) _ ^\nmainly for women Dear Madam, AFTER TRYING your recipe contained in the last FELIX Iam in great\ntrouble.

Structure of the stars\nON TUESDAY,8 th, Professor\nHermann Bondi of King's College, spoke to RCS Astronomical\nSociety on the structure of the\nstars, which are now generally accepted as the birthplace of the\nelements beyond hydrogen.\nSpeaking lucidly and without\nnotes, the Professor began by\nquoting Hoyle's statement that we\nknow more of what goes on inside the stars than inside a boiling kettle.\nForty years ago Eddington produced a workable theory of the structure of stars from simple assumptions\nregarding their chemical uniformity, and the knowledge that they are gaseous in nature. Without kno wing anything of the processes by which energy is released, he was able\nto derive a mass luminosity relation that accurately describes main-se-que n ce stars, and to calculate the\ntemperatures of their centres. Stars\nmove oil' the main sequence when they begin to age, and helium accumulates in their centres ; they swell, the temperature at their centres rises\nand the helium is burnt to po duce heavier elements. But the energy\nexpenditure demanded by Eddington' s relation cannot change ; whereas the\nstar's capital of energy must eventually run out. The smaller ones become white, and then black dwarfs supported entirely by cold pressure ;\nthis will be the fate of our sun. The larger ones shrink further and further,\nspin faster and faster and finally blow themselves apart by simple centrifugal force. It is suspected that if there\nwere no angular momentum whatever\nin the star (hardly conceivable), it would shrink to\" an absurdly small\" size.\nI' hot n: n,T. Williams Professor Bond i's forthcoming talk\nto the Huxley Society on\" Science\nand Religion\" has been postponed to\nthe 3 rd May. in order that a longer\nand more relaxed meeting maybe held, with the chance of a reasonable\ndiscussion period afterwards.\nC.R.C. MATERIALS RES EARa career with The exploitation of nuclear energy clearly necessitates the application of the most\nadvanced knowledge to ensure satisfactory performance from the materials involved.\nSimilarly, in conventional generation systems, significant improvements in the performance of traditional materials can be achieved through basic and applied\nresearch. The demand for electricity doubles every eight years and, at present, the\ndaily capital investment is around \u00a31,500,000.\nTherefore there is a continuing requirement for scientists of the highest calibre to\ninvestigate problems such as the creep of metals, irradiation effects, corrosion, and\nfracture processes. Young scientists with relevant research experience are particularly welcome. Much of the work is comparable with that carried out in universities\nand close links are maintained with laboratories doing similar work. Publication of\nresearch is actively encouraged, and so is the implementation of its results in the\noperational field.\nCENTRAL ELECTRICITY GENERATING BOARD\nFurther information is available\nfrom: W.H. F. Brooks, Recruitment and University Liaison Officer, Sudbury House,15 New gate Street, London, E.C.1 The Board's representatives will be visiting this University on March11966 when they\nwill be pleased to meet you to discuss career opportunities for metallurgists.

With this quotation, Dr.\nBlakemore began his lecture on\nLatin America, the second of a series of six.\nIn it he proposed to discuss the\nhistorical causes of the present\nsociological, economic, and political situations of Latin America,\nin a generalised form because of\nthe short time allowed.\n\u2022He began with a short description of the set up in LatinAmerica before\nthe wars of independence which lasted from1810 to1826. The whole of the continent, apart from Brazil, was under the Imperial rule of Spain. The continent was divided into states,\nwhich have remained much the same\nto the present day, and each state was\nruled by a Viceroy sent out from Spain. The Spanish governed through a bureaucracy, but at no point were\nthe Creoles( Spaniards born in LatinA'*\" ica) allowed to take part. The whole of the Civil Service came from Spain. The continent was exploited by the\nSpanish for its resources, both agricultural and mineral, and in exchange\nwas used as a market for Spanish manufactured goods. Thus at no stage\nin its development was LatinAmerica industrialised in anyway. After the wars of independence, the\nwhole continent Was left with no ruling class, no Civil Service and no industry. From the non, government was provided by the \" strong men,\" meaning dictators or presidents\nbacked by the military. Power revolved round the president, inhibiting local initiative and local development.\nGovernment continued as under the\nSpanish, through bureaucracy. Bribing became a recognised way of achieving aims and continued to the present day. Dictators came and went,\nbut this did not affect the countries\nBoat race\nat QM C JOHN RICK ARD, president of\nQ.E. C. Union, hopes to stage a beer-drinking match between Q. M.C.,I. C., and Q.M.

The first team\nto finish wins a drinking tankard. Volunteers see Adrian Fletcher.\nin anyway.\" l tie great significance\nof Latin American revolutions is, perhaps, that th cv are not at all significant,\" is how Dr. Blake more put it.\nThe economics of these countries\ncontinued in the same way as under Spanish rule. Only after the Second\nWorldWar, when the market. for raw materials suddenly developed did Latin American countries begin industrialisation, and by that time it\nwas too lat^ to prevent the economic difficulties into which they had fallen.\nThe past behind the present LatinAmerica shows that most of th a troubles that they have at the mo ment can be blamed on the unenlightened300 year long Spanish rule.\nThis was the conclusion reached by Dr. Blake more' s interesting if over-generalised talk.\nP. Combe s. Card Checks\nA UNION CAR De heck, conducted by Mike Scott, President of\nRCS, was held on Saturday night in the Union, and a number of people\nwere refused admittance to the Hop.

On the topic'' Christ\" in Industry\", the General Secretary of the\nTrades Union Congress had hardly an ff lifting explicit to say. This impression was built up from such assertions as : \" Voluntary negotiated wage agreements are not in all circumstances to be considered morally binding by the\ntrade unions\". He rejected the concept of a\" fair wage\" on the grounds\nthat in practice such a motion was without value. He likened the relationship between the two sides of Industry to that which exists in marriage. Mr. Woodcock admitted that he was \" the most shuffling compromise r there is\", but on the whole his views were in the best humanist tradition which is the way Christianity must manifest itself. He supported an incomes policy as it would lead to the advancement\nof lagging sections of the working community, and provide more resources)\nfor public enterprises.

    "content": "4 FELIX\nComment\nHALLS OF RESIDENCE\nby the editor Home from home or boarding school ?\nA DIRECTIVE was recently issued in the Southside halls of residence that all room furniture\nmust be returned to the positions it occupied\nin the rooms at the beginning of the session.\nThis arrangement is not. however, the one planned by the architect of Southside \u2014 the same which was enthusiastically praised by THE OBSERVER as the best student accommodation in the country, and the same that was so proudly exhibited to Princess Margaret at the Opening Ceremony. The layout of the rooms planned by Richard Sheppard may not be to the liking of us all, and a number of residents have chosen to adapt this \" ideal\" to their own satisfaction.\nHowever, a universally acknowledged\" non ideal \" arrangement is now being imposed. This move seems to be yet another infringement\nupon the liberties of residents in Imperial College halls \u2014 the majority of which seem\nto arise in Southside.\nThe Halls of Residence Committee needs to take\na fresh lock at the whole question of the\nstatus of the halls. Is a room in hall to be\nconsidered as the resident's home-from-home,\nwhere he may\u2014within reason\u2014do as he\nwishes, or a boarding-school mini-dormitory?\nWhy should one not be allowed to introduce the\noccasional overnight guest (some friends do have a habit of suddenly appearing on the\ndoorstep), to express one's individuality in the\ndecoration of one's room( and meet any expense thereby incurred), or add such furnishings as fridges, cookers and chairs, so long as such actions neither disturb ones neighbours( noise), nor alter the fabric of the\nbuilding, nor create difficulties for the clean-ing staff (safe electric wiring)? The second condition \u2014 toward which certain halls\nSeem to be steadily progressing (regressing?)\n\u2022\u2014leads one to wonder to what extent wardens\nShould be \" in loco parent is.\" Should they\ndetermine the moral codes of residents, for instance? This is bound to cause rebellion among the ranks, and residents will, like schoolboys, secretively seek to break the rules\nfor their own sake rather than more maturely follow a privately held moral code.\nCongratulations\nSir.\nI should like to congratulate\nI.C. Gilbert and Sullivan Group for a magnificent performance\nlast night of both\" Trial\" and\" Pinafore.\" Eventhough this\nwas the first performance of the\nweek, it was brisk, bright, colourful, well acted, well sung\n(although I did not agree with some of the musical interpretation), and generally excellently presented.\nThe only cause of disappointment was the small num ber in the audience, a characteristic of\" first nights \" at I.C., unfortunately, but I'm glad to\nfind that bookings are heavier\ntowards the end of the week\nI would encourage all who can to see this production. A good show deserves a good audience. Your sincerely,\nMike McGuire. Met.3. Why Silence\nSir.\nThe IC mass learned for the\nfirst time in the last issue of FELIX of actions which I for or\"\\ would like clarified. I understand by word of mouth as well as from FELIX co lu,i' the <\"wer ning board of FELIX in general, and the\nfour Colle se Presidents in par-ti cula r, objected to the continued use r\" the two-pronged\nfork Col cu^T^ no us as an instrument of destructive criticism. Fine. I a eree that purely destructive criticism seldom\nachieves a result, even if this\nwere its intention, for it is\neasily rejected, either on the\nmore emotional ground of back-stabbing, or else by\" So what would you do, Col cut t Ignotus ? \"\nThe point which still stands\nis that, however bothersome,\ndestructive criticism only arises\nwhen something is amiss, at\nleast in the mind of the critic.\nIf the people/ groups at whom criticism was aimed regard such\ncomment as pointless, why do they bother to wish to suppress\nit ? If it does have a genuine\npoint to make, Should FELIX not be allowed to voice it, so\nthat it comes to general notice,\nand, as is often the case, an answer must be written in'. he\nsame issue ?\nThis raises a second, more important, point. It seems that\nthe board of governors has\nused its censor i al powers simply to protect itself from anonymous review \u2014 Adrian Fletcher must have jumped through a hoop having been responsible\nfor Col cut t last year, to now damn it. Ian Williams was told that he might print either Col cut tor Ignotus. Asserting the\ngenerally held principle of the\n\" freedom of the press\" he printed both. Now he may print neither. So, the respect-ive, and, for their ability, le spec ted authors write in the\nopen, which need have little\neffect upon their material. What then has the board really achieved ; what did they in tend?\nMy summary may be unknowingly partial or slanted,\nmy facts may be adrift \u2014 I'd feel easier if this were so \u2014 but I think that there's a pair of blinkers on FELIX now. In the last issue of FELIX, Adrian Fletcher wrote that\nit would need to be a major break in communications for a fellow to be unable to chat with a Union official. I think IC as\na whole would perhaps like to\nsee an explanatory chat now. IAN COLLINS, Vice Chairman ACC.

In order that the Carnival Queen should be\" someone,\" and not just a set of vital statistics, by the time\nof the Carnival, it is proposed that\nshe be elected this term. The Carnival Board will select\ntwelve girls from the entries, and thses will have their photographs in FELIX and in the Union. Four finalists will be chosen by means of voting slips in FELIX and the\nQueen will be elected at the I CW A Formal on the 25th March. Only in the event of there being in sufficient entries from I CW A will secretaries and other staff from the College be eligible to enter.\nThe closing date for entries is 28th February. BARS CLOSE\"\nEARLIE R THE COLLEGE Bars, as no doubt regular patrons will have noticed by now, are closing five minutes before\nthe scheduled closing time. The Refectory Office tell FELIX that perm is sion has been given for the barmen to leave five minutes early for the duration of the London Transport bus men's go slow. It is to be hoped that patrons of the bars will co operate with the barmen and bring their normal drinking schedules forward five minutes to enable the staff\nto catch the last bus home.\nBlackett\nto speak\nPROFESSOR Blackett, President of the Royal Society, and Senior Re search Fellow at IC, will be guest\nspeaker at the Royal College' of Science Annual Dinner on Monday, May2 nd.

The whole event was organised hy IC Cross-Country Clubreport page 11.\nChurchill\ncrowns lost\nA RESIDENT of Be it Hall had a wallet stolen from his room some time last week ; it was returned to him a week later, minus the cash\n(four Churchill crowns), having been\nfound in one of the ladies' lavatories\nin the Royal College of Art. MORE TROUBLE\nFOR PHOENIX\nTHE NEXT issue of PHOENIX, IC's literary magazine, will not a ppe a* until early next term. Originally scheduled to appear this term, the delay has been attributed to the failure of contributors to supply copy and not the considerable loss made on last\nterm's issue.\nEditor Mervyn Jones blames an exceptionally high printer's bill and a poor response by advertisers for the\nloss on the last issue. He has again\nappealed for\" more material and staff \" for next year.\nG. W.Ed: We are told that most College magazines are having difficulty in obtaining advertising.\nGreater freedom for Social\nClubs Committee from the control of Council is proposed in a motion to be voted on at the next\nmeeting of SCC.\nThe motion, proposed by Pete\nRuhemann, Chairman of Communist Society, if accepted by\nboth S CC and Council would\nprovide that the SCC be able to\nalter its own standing orders-provided the powers of neither\nCouncil or the IC Union Executive are affected.\nSocial Clubs Committee\nThe present situation is that any change in the Standing orders\u2014the\nset of rules by which S CC governs\nits affairs \u2014 has to be presented at one meeting of S CC and Voted on at the\nNEXT meeting, and then, if it receives a two thirds majority, it is\n.passed on to the approval of Council. This means that even the most minor change can take up to six weeks to\nput through( Council only meets\nmonthly), and the situation naturally arises where Standing orders may clash with present procedure, or make no mention of important aspects of S CC's operations.\nThe proposed change would mean that alterations in Standing Orders\ncould be passed by oneS CC meeting\n(needing a two thirds majority), and would become operative after seven\ndays if no petition had been received\nfrom four members of S CC. If a petition were received, the motion would need one more reading before\nS CC to take effect. Only if the\n\" powers of Councilor the \u2022 ICU executive\" are affected would the\nchange have to appear before Council. Deputy President, Chris Mola m and\nICU Councilmember Pete Finch both\nfelt that the proposed changes were a sensible move, Mola m commenting\" t fj ere is an awful lot of deadwood... and this would streamline matters\non smaller things,\" but both Council members felt that ICU executive\nshould decide whether or not they (or\nCouncil) were affected (Exec, meet\nweekly) Finch suggesting that Council be notified. Chairman of S CC, Keith Guy, who also sits on Council, told FELIX that he had himself suggested that changes proposed by S CC should need the assent of Executive, but otherwise was wholeheartedly in favour of the motion put forward by Ru he mann. Einstein editor\nDR. G.J. WHIT ROW of Mathematics Department will be acting as\n\" general editor\" of three weekly programmes on Albert Einstein, to be\nbroadcast at 8.35 on Wednesdays, in the Third Programme, starting to-day,\n23rd February.

Wells\nSociety on Monday, February\n14th, and epi to mises the lively\nstyle which he used in his interesting talk on \"Water Pollution\nProblems in Britain.\"\nWith most of the rainfall in the\nnorth and west, and the lack of\nany national grid for water, the\nsouth-east centres of population\nare using water as many as three\nor four times before it gets to the\nsea.\nThere is a certain unpleasantness\nabout the idea that the water one\ndrinks may also have been drunk by three other people, but it is some\ncompliment to the effectiveness of sewage processes that we cannot tell \u2014\nin this country at least !\nAt a conventional sewage works the\nMComing sewage is ground up, then\nsettled, and the liquid is decanted off\nand sprayed on to filter beds where\na variety of micro-organisms oxidise\norganic matter, and most of the remaining solids are filtered off. A tertiary stage using alum to precipitate phosphate and chlorination is\nsometimes used.\nThe sludge is one of the worst\nproblems, being difficult to get rid of,\nespecially in industrial areas where it\nabsorbs an incredible amount of\nchemicals, which render it useless as a fertiliser.\nDetergent pollution has caused\nSortie c once tn, but it has be;n found that Straight-chain alkyl benzene sul pbo nate s are more easily broken up than the usual branched chain variety. An experiment, substituting\nthe better variety in Luton( still under the usual brand names \u2014 it's the same\nstuff in all the boxes, anyway), was so successful that the experiment was extended to the entire South of England. Many of the worst pollution problems are at coastal resorts where the\nsewage is poured straight into the sea.\nFortunately, light and warmth kill off\nthe harmful bacteria quickly, and Dr. Edwards was of the opinion that\npeople who bathed on cold stormy days with an onshore wind either deserved what they got, or were hardy enough to resist the extra bacteria !\nPresidential stakes CANVASSING for the post of IC President has taken place in earnest\nfollowing the editorial in the last\nissue of FELIX. Leading the Presidency stakes some yards from the\nstarting grid is Keith Guy,S CC Chair man, a short head in front of Dai Ho. veil, President of Guilds. At present trailing, but looking very fit. are Chris Mola m(IC U Deputy President), Keith Cavanagh and Council outsider Ray Phillips. I CW ARIUS. Aetherius Society THE IC Aether ius Society Group has withdrawn its proposed const it u tion, which was due to be discussed\nat last week's meeting of the Social Clubs Committee. A new cons it uti on is being worked out which will have\na greater emphasis towards S CC and less toward the national Society, and will be presented later in the term. Shadchan evening\nS HAD HAN IS A YIDDISH\nword meaning 'matchmaking' and\nthis was the basis of an informal\nparty held at Chelsea College on\nSunday 13th Feb.\nThe evening was organised by\nmembers of Imperial, Chelsea\nand Battersea Colleges' Jewish\nSocieties, but the entry was not\nrestricted to students only.\nOn arrival each person was handed a green or pink questionnaire acc or ding to sert (where discern able). The completed forms were then examined by the SADIST( SemiAutomatic Device for Investigation of Sexual Trou ma), the person was assigned to\na group A,B, CorD and given a tag bearing the letter to be prominently displayed. The result of the\ncomplex sociological analysis given to\neach set of answers ensured that\nPeople in the same categories would be suitable partners for dancing, etc.,\netc. . . .\nThe questions covered such soul searching tops is \" Would you support a campaign to make John Bloom Chief Rabbi?\"\" Do men call you' sti \u00bb ar'? If so, are you( a) sweet\nand easily dissolved 7 (b) refined ?\n(c) untouched by human hand?\"\" If\na man complimented you on v our figure, would vo u hold it against him:( a)Yes?( b) No?(c) Sideways ? \"\nOf course the questions brought\nout the wit in some people and man v amusing answers were received,\nmost lv from the girls : to the quest ion\" Would you have married the\nMarquis de Sade?\" one replied, \" Yes. at a pinch!\"As a means of promoting friend ship it was quite successful, and the\nparty seemed quite active with no one left out. The method thus has\npromise as a means of getting people\ntogether.\nUFO's at Wellsoc\nREPORTS of UFOs (Uniden-tif i ed Flying Objects) have been\nmade for several hundred years,\nthough reports have been far\nmore frequent this century, and\nespecially in the last 25 years, but\nthis is partly accounted for by\nthe increased ease of com mu nica tion.\nMany of the reports come from\npilots and truck drivers and other\nsuch people who are required by\ntheir occupations to watch the\nsky or to be regularly out at\nnight.\nThe suggestion that they make the reports as a joke can often be discounted simply because such reports\nget a very scathing local press. It is\nunlikely to be a figment of their imagination as there is correlation of\ndetail in reports from China, South America, and all parts of the world, and this is especially remarkable when the observers live in isolated communities with no exposure to science\nfiction speculation.\nAs with all other unexplained phe-nomen a, a religious significance has\nbeen attached to UFOs, but a more objective approach will be taken by the Study Group of the H.G. Wells Society when it collects and examines\nthe evidence on the phenomenon. Efforts will be made to refute the existence of UFOs on the basis of\nknown natural effects, and then to\nexamine the remaining evidence.\nG2 SEX\nat General\nStudies\nSEX is a subject near to all our\nhearts, but when it is coupled\nwith religion interest wanes. Despite this the General Studies lecture given by Rev. Kenneth Greet\nof the Methodist'Church was well\nattended, no doubt drawn by that\nsingle word title.\nThe speaker gave a lucid, well-defined talk which neither\nshocked nor produced anything\nvery new.\nHe divided his talk into three subjects : promotion of conception, prevention cf conception, and abortion \u2014\nall of topical interest. He gave the\nChurch' s view on artificial in sem in a tion, saying that if it was by the hus-band it was right, and if by donor wrong. On other methods of conception\npromotion, such as the grafting of\novary tissue to cure infertility, he said\nthey were right if they enhanced the\nessentially personal relationship of the\nfamily set-up\nConsidering the Abortion Bill, he\nsaid that was right that it shot' d safeguard human life, but that twa lives should be considered, BT J mother's being the more important of\nthe two. The half hour talk was followed by some attacking questions on the ability\nof the Church to lay down the law on matters concerning sex.\nP.M. C. "

    "content": "FELIX7 Hermann Bondi Talks to Felix\nFamous mathematician of King's talks about his work and views\nto Chris Cooper\nProfessor Hermann Bondi, FRS, FRAS,\nwas born in Vienna, took his MA at\nTrinity, Cambridge, is now Professor of\nMathematics at King's, London, and by\nvirtue of his frequent recent visits to IC, deserves the title of Visiting Professor here.\nTwo weeks ago I interviewed him in his\ntiny office at King's, shamelessly demanding potted pronouncements of his views on\ncosmology, religion and education. Here is\npart of that interview.\nHoyle's Steady-state Theory\nQ:What are your views on Hoyle' s abandon ment of the steady-state theory, at least for the\nlocal universe?\nA: Well I have disagreed with Hoyle for a num ber of years on the whole situation here. I have always felt that the steady state theory was a very\ngood guess in the sense that it was a very simple model. It may well be that we have been driven from this very simple position. I then see no point in trying to maintain it in a very complicated way overall as he did with Nar li kar, or in some still wider way as he is considering now. The only advantage of the steady-state theory is its\nsimplicity. If the simplicity has\" to be abandoned there are other mode's I would look at first.\nQ:What were your original reasons for adopt-ing the theory? A: Basically the point of simplicity. If you have a changing Universe then you must conte m plate . . . a changing physics. I think that many of us \u2014 of course Hoyle has been extremely forceful in this himself in much of his work \u2014 many of us\nbe'i eve there is a strong link between local Physics and the Universe at large, and the difficulty of\nknowing how Physics has changed in these circumstances is very great indeed, because naturally all our present knowledge is gained at what is a moment in the life of the Universe. Therefore there are innumerable possibilities for changes \u2014\nonly a very few have been explored. One of them is a change in the constant of gravitation during the life of the Universe, but there is really no limit and Oi course one knows from the history of Physics that it will not be the nth possibility\ninvestigated that will turn out to be particularly fruitful, but the ( n+l) th. If the universe is\nchanging; on the other hand if the universe is unchanging... this is a typical moment in the life\nof the Universe and we can use our physics with confidence. Of course this may be quite wrong but it is a very good thing to try as a first shot.\nMicro-macro link\nQ: Do you see any immediate stimulus to cosm ology from the sort of elementary particle\nphysics that goes on at IC?A: What you are asking me is practically to be\na soothsayer and this is very difficult. As you know, everything in elementary particle physics\nis based on the idea of Lorentz co variance. On the other hand the universe as a whole is certainly\nnot Lorentz con variant. We know that if I get\nan isotropic view of the universe around me, if I were moving at a high speed through this position, I would see an anisotropic view, so that the\nuniverse determines a velocity. I like to say that\nwhat the general principle of relativity states is\nthat as yet no experiment has been performed that\nreveals this cosmological ly prefer ed velocity, but\nof course such an experiment may be performed\none day. Some elementary particle processes may be related to this cosmic velocity.\nQ:I would have thought the local velocity of\nlight was the velocity in question.\nA:N o,no, this is not the velocity of light at all, \u2014 [ Cooper subsides in bewilderment] \u2014 look, when we look round us, we see the velocity-distance\nrelation operating, in whatever direction we are\nlooking. If we were moving through our present\nposition with three-quart'.rs. cf the velocity of\nlight, and looked at the universe around us, then\nat the moment of moving through our present position, we would see the same kind of thing we see\nhere \u2014 that we see from our own present state of\nmotion \u2014 but of course, the red-shirts and blue-shifts and intensities would be rather different\nand they would not give us an isotropic picture.\nWe would, after all, looking forward see lots more blue'-shifts and looking backwards; very much enhanced red-shifts. Therefore there is a definite\nvelocity not violently different from our actual velocity, which is the cosmological ly prefer ed one.\nQ: It would be like the Michelson Morley experiment but with a positive result ?\nA: It would be this kind of thing, exactly, and we would expect this to come out cf any experiments which had very strong cosmic links different\nfrom the links that may underlie Mach' s principle or such a thing. Now you can imagine many things\nlike that, for example there have been investigations of neutrino degeneracy of the neutrino back-ground; now of course, the neutrinos here that\npass through us from all the stars in the Universe will not formaL or ent.' con variant set. and any-thing very strongly affected by that, any nuclear\nreaction, would reveal this. I'm not a believer in an aether, but I think it is very hard to say that\nthere aren't neutrinos and anti-neutrinos rushing round in a manner which contains this preferred\nvelocity.\nQ:What actually is your present line of re-search?\nA: It's almost entirely in theory of gravitation, general relativity, such problems as gravitational waves, energy transfer by gravitation, configurations of high gravitational potential and so on. Q: Is this all done on paper?\nA: All on paper, entirely.\nQ: How does one become a cosmologist ?\nA: Well, I don't think one should become a cosm o log is t;I think there are very few people who have made a really worthwhile contribution to\ncosmology who specialised all their lives in this\nsubject. Very many important contributions have\ncome from people who' ve been theoretical physicists in other directions, or astronomers in ether\ndirections, and then have made occasional contributions; that kind of thing... I think theoretical\nastronomy is a very good field of employment for\na theoretical physicist, and if he does theoretical\nastronomy he may go over and once or twice\nwrite a paper on cosmology. Science and Religion\nQ: You' re going to be talking to the Huxley Society on\" Science& Religion.\" What lines will you be talking on? A: Well, I obviously don't want to talk too much about it now, but I feel very strongly that there's a hangover from the nineteenth century about' the conflict between the results of science, and what\nthe religions claim as facts. Now, that, I think, has largely evaporated because theologians have\nbecome so very much more flexible. I don't think there's any serious conflict in that direction at all; on the other hand, there is a good deal of conflict\nbetween the methods of science with their essential\nbelief in human fallibility, and the sometimes\narrogant public claims of revealed religion, although I have no quarrel with a modest form of\nprivate religion. Implementation of Robbins\nQ:I read your article in Isis expressing enthusiastic support for the Robbins report. What were\nyour reasons for welcoming Robbins? A: Well, it seems to me that we are in an ext ra ordinarily fortunate position. We have an\nenormous growth of desire for education, including higher university education, coming very much at the same time as the economy is moving into a phase where more and more highly educated\npeople are required, and it is not necessary for\nthese two things to move in phase. We know, for example, that countries like India are full of\nunemployed graduates, and we know of other\ncountries where there would be great openings for\ngraduates, but there are not enough people coming forward to the universities. Well, it seems to me\nthat this great growth of desire together with the\ngreat growth of opportunity must be matched by\nuniversity traditions. I think that lack of desire\nis responsible for standards being no higher than\nthey were in the past and that even when reaching\na much larger fraction of the population, there's not the slightest reason to believe that \" more\nmeans worse \" as the opponents of Robbins have\nso often said.\nQ: Do you think the recommendations of\nRobbins are being implemented far enough ?\nA: Well, of course, there are many aspects of\nthis that Iam quite unqualified to speak about. I mean this vexed question of the position of the\nColleges of Education, where the Government has\ndecided against Robbins. I can't speak about this,\nI don't know either side of the question well enough. In the universities my feeling is that\nthe same thing holds back the universities as holds\nback everything in the country's economy, namely, the building industry is not as productive as it\nought to be, and that therefore it is very hard to\nget sufficient results to be able to accommodate all that should be accommodated, and to be able\ntv do so efficiently.\nQt Would you support the idea of a hierarchy\nwithin universities so that Oxbridge would have a privileged position?\nA: Well, I'm certainly violently against anything that ossifies a position, because in the minds of\ncertain schoolmasters the opinion hangs on that\nOxbridge, because it was pre-eminent fifty years\nago, must be pre-eminent now, and that that\nshould in any way be codified for the future when it's no longer true now, seems to me quite absurd. No,I like a good deal of competition and free\ntrade between the universities; if we have academic\nfreedom, then at least we can experiment and find\nout.\n\n"
