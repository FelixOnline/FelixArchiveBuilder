Kahn\u2019 s latest\nfilm about the hardships Mulims\nface in the USA is proving\ncontroversial in India.\nAkira live action film\nresurrected\nVulture blog apparently has the\nscoop that the classic anime film\nis to be remade into a two part\nfilm by the Hughes Brothers\nfresh off their latest hit The Book\nof Eli. Interestingly most Akira\nFans rejoiced when the project\nlooked dead last summer.\nThe cause of the mass destruction is\nnever explained and the audience is\nnever encouraged to care. The point\nis everything has died. No plants or\nanimals have existed for the past few\nyears. It\u2019s only the humans who have\nsurvived, and since all we make is\ntrouble, this sets the perfect apocalyptic scene. An unnamed man (Viggo\nMortensen) and his son (Kodi SmitMcPhee) struggle on, heading south,\nhoping it will be warmer and more\nhabitable. Their journey is never easy\nsince man has turned against each oth-er, resorting to theft, murder, rape and\ncannibalism. The na\u00efve son, who still\nhas his youth and innocence intact,\nis desperate for them to be \u201cthe good\nguys.\u201d And the father doesn\u2019t have the\nheart to tell him that not everything\nworks that way. But of course, when\nsociety has been damaged to such an\nextent, survival involves getting your\nhands dirty, an idea never fully grasped\nby the boy who was born during the\nmost unfortunate times.\nSmit-McPhee is convincing in his\npurest, boyish form, shocked and horrified at every dishonesty and moral\ncorruption from his surroundings.\nMortensen gives a truly moving performance as the father who will do literally anything to protect his son; he\u2019s\neven prepared to shoot the boy himself\nEverybody\nloves Forest\nEdKnock\nEdKnock\nA\ncouple of weeks ago I controversially declared that\nForest Gump was not a\ngood film. Since then, numerous people have approached me complaining that I slated\ntheir favourite movie, one person even\nlooked like they were going to burst into\ntears. Before an inquisition is started and\nI\u2019m burned at the stake for heresy, I feel I\nneed to explain my stance.\nFirstly, by stating that Forest Gump is\nnot a good film, please don\u2019t assume that\nI meant it is a bad film. Compared to the\nusual dross that is spewed out of Hollywood these days it stands rather favour-ably. I would argue that the film is easily\nabove average in terms of quality but was\nit worthy of all its Oscars? In my opinion,\nno.\nLet\u2019s take a look at characters, one of\nthe film\u2019s strongest points in many critic\u2019s\nviews. The main protagonist Forest is unbelievably tedious, his naivety prevents\nhis character gaining any real emotional\ndepth. When he\u2019s supposedly portraying\nhappiness, sadness or anger we are given\nthe same dumb expression. I understand\nhis childlike demeanour is intentional\nso that his innocence and honesty can be\nmanipulated and abused by those around\nhim but by lacking any common sense, it\u2019s\nhard for the audience to relate to him. And\nthen there\u2019s Bubba: simply Forest in black\nskin. I know his friendship with Forest is\nincredibly heartwarming but at the end\nof the day he is just another idiot. Captain\nDan is another stereotype, selfish and successful who loses everything before gaining humility as Forest helps him rebuild\nhis life - Oh I wasn\u2019t expecting that!\nThe only decent character in the whole\nfilm was Forest\u2019s love interest Jenny. She\nhad no quirky traits or crazy misfortunes and I can truly sympathise with\nhow she constantly tries to run from the\nmoron Gump.\nThe episodic format of Forest Gump\nis a lazy style of story telling with numerous instances of Deux ex Machina\nsuch as the storm during the fishing\nscene. In fact the plot is essentially a\npatchwork of pop-culture references\nwhich becomes one joke too far very\nsoon. Forest teaching Elvis to dance?\nIt\u2019s just ridiculous and though the\ntechnology behind putting Tom\nHanks into famous news\nfootage is certainly impres-sive, it\u2019s not a premise to base\na film around.\nMybiggestproblemwithForestGump\nis the rather nasty conservative context\nthat lies underneath all the sentimental\ncodswallop. This attack on counter-cul-ture is blatantly obvious once you look\nfor it; Forest Gump, clean cut and hardworking is constantly successful whilst\nnever questioning anything. However\nJenny, who takes an alternative route in\nlife involving political activism, drugs\nand sexual liberation eventually turns\nout to be loser - she dies of cancer. The\nVietnam scenes are an insult to those\nwho suffered on both sides of the war,\nthe fact that Forest loses his best friend\nand Dan his legs, yet they eventually\ncome out winners in stark contrast to\nreality.\nAt the end of the day Forest Gump is\nan enjoyable film but when you consider that Pulp Fiction and The Shawkshank Redemption were nominated for\nthe Best Picture Oscar that Gump eventually won, its puzzling to understand\nwhy everyone loves it.\nI was originally going to write about a\nterrible poster for the new film Percy\nJackson and the Lightening Thief (Every\nbus stop from the Albert Hall to Hammersmith has it displayed, take a look,\nit is truly awful). Whilst browsing the\ninternet for such offending poster I\ncame across this beauty on slashfilm.\ncom and decided to comment upon my\nadmiration for it instead.\nI\u2019m instantly reminded of the Soviet\npropaganda posters of Alexander Rodchenko, the film\u2019s title \u2018Connected\u2019 is\nprinted in a very Russian style. I love the\nscene of two figures against a minimal\nbackdrop, our eyes are immediately\ndrawn to the white tubes linking their\nmasks on their biohazard style suits.\nI\u2019m intrigued by the sense of mystery\nthe poster portrays, its simplicity is the\nkey and begs us to ask the question;\njust what has happened to these\ntwo people?\nThere is a short teaser\nfor the film on its website.\nIt looks in the similar vein as\nAlive in Jo\u2019burg on which District\n9 was based - www.ov43.com\nFilm Editor\nZombieland 2\nconfirmed\nZombieland was a surprisingly\ngood film, balancing horror\nand genuine comedy.

    "content": "10 felix FRIDAY 12 FEBRUARY 2010\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT\nAnrgyGeekwith this week\u2019s offering\nT\nhere\u2019s something about\ngroup work at Imperial\nthat just brings the best\nout of people, isn\u2019t there?\nIt\u2019s like a cross between\nOcean\u2019s Eleven and that scene from the\nPower Rangers where everyone teams\nup and combines into a giant robot\npenis.\nI think everyone knows how shit\ngroup work is, because my department does its best to hide the fact\nthat a piece of work is to be done in a\ngroup until the very last moment, as if\nthere\u2019s a small chance some of us will\njust quit the degree if we find out too\nearly. But eventually, with a crushing inevitability, the group work will\ncome. It will find you. And then the\nprocess goes a little something like\nthis.\nFirst, you\u2019ll find your go-to partner.\nThe one person you can rely on not\nto urinate a little between the pages\nof the report just before you hand it\nin. You\u2019ll look at each other across the\nlecture hall and just give a little nod,\nlike you\u2019re in an episode of Hustle or\nsomething. It actually makes you look\nlike someone\u2019s tugging you off underneath the lecture hall desks, but you\nthink it looks cool, so that\u2019s fine.\nBut that\u2019s just two people. You\nknow what they say about two - it\u2019s\ncompany, and this shit isn\u2019t about\ncuddling in front of the fire. Oh no.\nWe want a bloody group, don\u2019t we? A\nbig manly group. So you need three\nmore people. This starts off pretty\nsimply, because you tend to just discover another pair like yours. There\u2019s\nusually something slightly off about\nthem at first, though. You know the\nsort of situation - it\u2019s like when someone you thought was normal introduces you to someone they \u2018knew at\nsecondary school\u2019 and they look like\nan axe-murderer who discovered Jesus, and then rediscovered axe-mur-dering in the middle of a communion\nsession.\nProblem is, it\u2019s slim pickings because everyone else you know has\nsodded off into a group of their own\nby now, so you hire the crazy and crazier two-pack. Four people. Now this\nis looking good. This is what we\u2019re\nafter; a big manly group. But there\u2019s\na bit missing, we need five people!\nFive is the manliest number possible.\nAnd what does every man needs? He\nneeds a massive dick. So you go and\nfind one.\nIt\u2019s not like you actively go searching for one, it\u2019s just that you find\nyourself unable to lie about group\nwork. So when the most useless, feckless pile of skin shaped like a student\nasks you if your group is full, you just\nsay no. Mostly, this is out of a desire\nto just get the five people and start\nwork, but it\u2019s also partly because you\nknow you\u2019re going to end up with an\narsehole like him one way or another,\nbecause all the good group members\nhave gone. It\u2019s the Year Seven football\ntournament all over again.\nSo you\u2019ve assembled the Special\nNeeds X-Men. Congratulations. Now\nit\u2019s time to start work! Hey, I\u2019ve got an\nidea, why don\u2019t we distribute the work\naccording to our relative strengths\nand weaknesses, and conduct regular\nmeetings to review work and co-ordi-nate our efforts! No? Okay, just pick\nwhatever you want to do and we\u2019ll\nmeet again in eight weeks\u2019 time.\nTime passes. Wars are fought, companies rise and fall, governments\nstrive tirelessly to improve the lives\nof their citizens. You download the\nlatest episodes of Dexter and think\nabout buying an electric toothbrush.\nIt sounds like a good idea, but you\nstop using it after it begins to make\nnoises like a cordless drill.\nAfter a few weeks of ball-scratch-ing you get down to work, complete\na few tasks and finally get ready to\nmeet your group. Hooray! Everyone\u2019s\nworked really hard in the last week or\ntwo and you\u2019ve got a lot of things to\nput together.\nOh no wait, it\u2019s all got to be done in\nthe next twelve hours. And a report.\nThat\u2019s okay, though, because you\u2019ve\ngiven the report to the guy who\u2019s \u201creally good at writing\u201d. He\u2019s got an A\nLevel in Advanced Words or some-thing. Cool, man, cool.\nEleven hours and fifty-eight minutes later, you finish picking out the\nlast of the misplaced full stops and\nmissing capital letters from his work,\nand hit print. You shuffle it together\nwith the project work, put enough\nstaples into it to kill a rhinoceros, and\nthrow it in the general direction of\nyour tutor.\nBut it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re so often told,\nthe real working world is like this all\nthe time! Why is it like this? Because\nthe real working world was educated\nin the same half-arsed, unguided\n\u2018group work\u2019 environment you were.\n\u201cyou\u2019ve assembled\nthe Special Needs\nX-Men.\n...Now it\u2019s time to\nstart work!\u201d\n\n"

He is accused of improperly discussing politics prior to his retirement from the military, and will be court-martialed,\naccording to the government.

Beautiful images of ugly truths\nare explored including climate change,\npoverty, the wasteful use of resources,\npopulation expansion, habitat destruction and species loss. The exhibition is\npresented as a 60m banner in which the\nphotos are interspersed with Dylan\u2019s\nlyrics, and has already been viewed by\nover 10 million people despite only beginning last year.\nThe Hard Rain Project was created\nas an exhibition and as a charity to\nsupport educational programmes for\nschools, colleges and universities with\nthe support of the United Nations Environment Program, ClimateCare and\nStill Pictures \u2013 Edward\u2019s photography\nagency specialising in social and environmental issues and nature.

James\nsaid what many newspapers have;\nthat,\u201dBenedict XVI... urged Catholic\nBishops in the UK to fight the Equalities Bill with missionary zeal\u201d. Unfortunately for James, this is not actually the\ncase as, if he had read the Pope\u2019s Annus Sacerdotalis, he would have seen\nthat the Pope\u2019s criticisms were clearly\nof the already existing legislation on\nadoption services, not on legislation\nbeing currently considered.\nBut let\u2019s assume that the Pope had\nindeed meant to criticise the Bill\nand look at James\u2019 argument that \u201c[t]\nhe Pope should not be interfering in\nBritish politics\u201d. He claims that \u201c[t]he\nproblem arises from Catholic bishops\nwho maintain seats in the House of\nLords, and as a result still have some\nsay in the running of the country\u201d\u2013 a\nsituation that would no doubt worry\nanyone who believes in democracy\nand the separation of church and state.\nThis assertion, however, is also laughable to anyone with basic knowledge of\nBritish politics, who will know that the\nCatholic Church has been historically\noppressed by the political elite in Britain, and certainly hasn\u2019t got a single\nBishop in the Lords. This is opposed\nto the Church of England, which was\nnot the focus of the comment piece.\nThe size of this worrying gap in James\u2019\nknowledge of British politics is made\nclearer by the irrelevant quip that the\nPope\u2019s visit in September will cost \u00a320\nmillion; a necessary expense caused by\nthe visit of any head of state as not only\nis it essential that the security be provided by British police, but also that we\nas a nation remain a good host.\nBut now for the important part of the\ndebate; namely the conflict between\nreligious freedom and the freedom\nof others. I believe in a separation of\nchurch and state; bishops should not\nbe in the House of Lords due to being\nbishops. I also believe that no one applying for a job should face discrimination on the grounds of political belief,\nreligious belief or sexuality. But, like\nmost, I believe that there are clear and\ncommon sense exceptions to this; the\nLabour party\u2019s manifesto clearly states\nthat only those who support its politics can stand for election within the\nparty. It would be ludicrous for this to\nbe banned as political discrimination.\nYet if a conservative applied to be a\npostman, then to discriminate would\nbe wrong. Surely the same applies to\nreligious belief; religions clearly cannot say that gay people mustn\u2019t deliver\ntheir post; they can however insist that\npriests, bishops, etc adhere to Catholic\nThis\nweek\nMPs back vote on\nelectoral reform\nMPs have agreed to introduce a referendum on\nwhether we should ditch\nthe \u201cfirst past the post\u201d\nsystem we currently\nhave and replace it with\nan \u201calternative vote\u201d system where candidates\nare ranked in preference\norder. MPs backed the\nreferendum by 365 votes\nto 178. The plan was put\nforward by Gordon Brown as a way of increasing the public\u2019s trust in government. It is not certain, however, whether\nthe legislation will be introduced before the coming General\nElection. Jack Straw, Justice Secretary, (pictured) called it an\n\u201cimportant debate\u201d for democracy in this country.\nGovernment\u2019s torture\nappeal lost\nThe European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour\nof the 27 new European commissioners,\neach having previously\nfaced the Parliament. .\nMEPs cast 488 votes in\nfavour, 137 against and\nthere were 72 absten-tions. The Commission\nis responsible for drafting EU laws and ensuring that all 27\nmember states comply with EU treaties. The vote on the\nCommission was delayed by three months due to delays in\nratifying the Lisbon Treaty. The president of the Commission,\nPortuguese Jose Manuel Barroso, was approved for a second\nterm by the EU government leaders before the latest vote.\nEU Commission\nchosen by Parliament\nJudges ruled that redacted\nparagraphs describing\nBinyam Mohamed\u2019s treatment as \u201ccruel, inhuman\nand degrading\u201d should be\nreleased. \u201cWe have fought\nthis case and brought the\nappeal to defend a principle we believe is fundamental to our national\nsecurity - that intelligence\nshared with us will be protected by us,\u201d Mr Miliband\nsaid. The paragraphs say that interrogators subjected him to\nsleep deprivation and threats and inducements. Mr Mohamed was secretly flown to Morocco by the US where he claims\nhe was tortured with the involvement of the British.\nbeliefs which since the second Vatican\nCouncil in the 1950s have held that it\nis wrong for employers to descriminate\non the grounds of sexuality. Besides,\nif employment legislation applied to\nPriests they would be in for a nice pay\nrise and dramatically reduced hours;\nexemptions work both ways.\nJames argues that \u201cyou are allowed\nto believe what you like; you\u2019re just\nnot allowed to do whatever you like\u201d. A\nmeaningless statement as belief, most\nwould say, is nothing without practice.\nHe cites the example of religions that\npromote polygamy not being allowed\nto do so in practice. I would like to ask\nJames what exactly is wrong with polygamy in principle? If people consent\nto it; why not? Surely he sees that having more than one wife or husband is\nof no harm to anyone else. And harm\nis a key issue \u2013 were polygamy to be\nforced on others, this would be wrong.\nBut this would not be the case. James\u2019\nreasoning, along with the reasoning of\nthe proponents of this Bill, is in clear\ncontradiction of that cornerstone of\nmodern British liberalism; do as you\nwant, just don\u2019t harm anyone else without their consent. As long as Catholic\nteaching on homosexuality doesn\u2019t call\non them being harmed, I don\u2019t see how\nit\u2019s anyone\u2019s business. You may not like\nit, but there are no grounds for banning it. Like James Blunt.\nAs for what right the Pope has to\n\u201cmeddle with Britain\u201d; the Pope has\nno legal authority here. It is up to British law makers and citizens to decide\nwhether or not to take his advice. It\nis interesting that no one complained\nwhen the Vatican called the invasion of\nIraq \u201ca crime against peace\u201d, an issue of\nvastly greater importance. Not to mention that one of the greatest criticisms\nlevelled against the Church is (with\nsome justification) that they didn\u2019t intervene enough against Nazism; critics\nsimply can\u2019t have it both ways.\nThe belief in the separation of\nchurch and state works two directions;\nthe church can\u2019t force the state to behave in a certain way and the state can\u2019t\nstart telling the church what it can and\ncan\u2019t do in its own business. That\u2019s only\nsensible.\nRory Fenton\nRory Fenton\nPope Benedict XVI\u2019s comments on equality and homosexuality have caused a stir in the face of a new equality bill.\n\n"

The camera cuts to a longshot\nand the mine suddenly explodes in the\nsoldiers face throwing him high into\nthe air. This sounds like a step into\ndarker themes for Jean Pierre Jeunet,\nthe man who gave us the surreal brilliance of Delicatessen and the anarchic\nspirit of Amelie.\nBut we are soon back to familiar territory as we introduced to the unfortunate soldier\u2019s young son Bazil. A brief\nmontage then depicts our protagonist\u2019s childhood who appears to have\nadopted the misfortune of his father.\nBazil accidently ends up with a bullet\nlodged in his brain, removing it might\nmake him a vegetable and so the surgeons leave it in though he now carries the risk of dropping dead at any\nminute. Ending up on the streets af-piece and the family of second-hand\ndealers that Bazil joins is full of wacky\npersonalities for the audience to laugh\nwith, cringe at and admire. Most memorable of these characters is Remington\n(Omar Sy), displaced from his homeland in the Congo and constantly reciting proverbs and other words of wis-dom, his impersonation of a Nigerian\ngangster is very amusing.\nOf course a Jeunet film would not be\ncomplete without Dominique Pinon\nwho easily slips into the role of the indestructible Buster, keen to please but\nslightly creepy. With names like Slammer, Calculator, Tiny Pete and Elastic\nGirl you can imagine that the rest of\nthe gang are of a similar zany standard.\nThe film looks fantastic, combining\nthe run down, antique-style aesthetics of Delicatessen with the classic architecture of Paris most lovingly shot\nin Amelie. Micmacs is Delicatessen\u2019s\nspiritual successor and there is even\na cheeky reference slipped in at one\npoint.\nThe most novel aspect of Micmacs\nis that the characters appear to aware\nthat their existence is a fabrication, the\nsoundtrack is perceived by Bazil as the\nperfect accompaniment to his current\npredicament such as a full orchestra\nplaying a crescendo to a dramatic mo-ment. The film\u2019s publicity posters are\neven prominently displayed on various\nbillboards during the film.\nThe plot is basically a heist movie in\ndisguise but instead of lengthy explanations of the gang\u2019s schemes we are left\nto follow their activities and for large\npart of the film you are left in amazement trying to understand what just\nhappened. The story progresses like\nclockwork, every device clicking\ninto place throwing twists and turns\nthat keep you on the edge of your seat\nthroughout.\nThis only possible with the steady\nhand of Jean Pierre Jeunet on the pacing and smooth transitions betweens\nscenes so the film never looks like a\nseries of set pieces randomly sewn to-gether. The climax is wonderful example of a how a yellow-tinted lens can\nmake a big difference which will leave\nyour jaws hanging.\nThe script is very strong too, a romantic subplot between Bazil and\nElastic Girl is eloquently presented and\nthe film\u2019s villains compare themselves\nto Rimbaud (who apperently was a gun\nrunner). With a great script, cast and\ndirection Micmacs should be a classic,\nbut it isn\u2019t. The originality which made\nAmelie and Delicatessen so unique has\nnow faded into Deja Vu. I hate to say it\nbut at times Micmacs felt a little sterile,\nas if the creativity had been forced into\nthe film.

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 12 FEBRUARY 2010\nL\nast year the lives of the\npeople of Gaza changed\ndramatically for the worse.\n1400 were killed, many\nmore homeless and desperate with short supplies. Last week,\nImperial College was educated about\nGaza. The aim of \u2018Gaza Week\u2019 was to\ninform us (Joe Public) of the importance of supporting the people of Gaza\nwho are in need of our support. The\nAhlulBayt society took it upon themselves to promote this worthy cause.\nUnfortunately, the opportunity was\nsquandered and what positive effect\nthey might have had was lost under a\nplatform of hate. The stall which was\nset out everyday with the supposed\naim of informing students about the\nsituation in Gaza was covered with\nleaflets and fliers about the \u201cPalestineIsrael\u201d conflict with several different\nfliers demanding a boycott of Israel.\nAs an inquisitive bystander I wandered up to the stall to ask the people\nmanning it why, if they were going to\ntalk about the conflict surrounding\nthe situation, did they not mention\nsome key facts? For instance, the very\nreason why Israel took the action they\ndid, whether you agree with it or not,\nwas because over 8,000 rockets in 8\nyears had been fired from Gaza and\nfallen onto Israeli soil. The towns of\nSderot and Ashqelon, and surrounding areas in the Negev were terrorised\nwith these bombardments to such\nan extent that tens of thousands fled\nin fear. There are children living in\nSderot who have never played outside\nbecause of the fear of what could happen to them if the 15 second warning went off and a rocket hit. In fact,\nwhy wasn\u2019t it mentioned that rockets\nare still being fired from Gaza? Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was kidnapped and taken into Gaza by Hamas\non the 25th of June 2006 and still has\nnot been returned to Israel. Hamas\nhave refused the International Red\nCross to visit him contrary to International Human Rights. A plain obvious\nfact absent from any of the information provided was that Gaza shares\na border with Egypt. If a boycott on\nIsrael is called for in order for them\nto open up the borders then it would\nonly be fair and correct if a boycott of\nEgypt was also called for.\nUpon closer examination of these fli-ers, it wasn\u2019t just that they were one sided\nbut they also had factual inaccuracies (a\nnice way of saying lies). Misquoting UN\nresolutions; not mentioning one suicide\nbombing when talking about the Intifadas, failing to mention Israel\u2019s unilateral\nwithdrawal from Gaza with the hope for\npeace, to name a few.\nThe one possible redemption for this\nwaste of trees was \u201cThe Gaza Massacre one year on...\u201d event. In terms of\nits title I was already suspicious that it\nwasn\u2019t going to be very Israel friendly,\nyet my hope would be that it would at\nleast promote the Palestinian cause in\norder for progress to be made.\nThe attendance of this event was\nslightly er...shvach to use a Yiddish\nterm and just as well because the\nquality of content was worse. The\nfirst of two speakers, Raza Kazim, a\nsenior speaker from the Islamic Human Rights Commision, had one\nmain message: \u201cAre we going to stand\nwith the oppressed, or are we going to\nstand with the oppressor?\u201d In fact he\nliked this phrase so much he had it on\nhis T-shirt just in case we didn\u2019t get\nthe message the first time. His black\nand white view of the conflict not only\nshowed his naivety and ignorance, but\nalso simplified the conflict to such an\nextent he missed out the basic facts\nwhich I mentioned above.\nSo passionate was he on human\nrights and the cause he was promoting\n(which veered off helping those suffering in Gaza and went onto boycotting\nIsrael) he proclaimed: \u201cSometimes in\norder to uphold the law and to make\nsure that the spirit of the law is actually preserved we need to sometimes\nbreak the laws that are actually there\nand we need to, as a result of breaking\nthat law be prepared to suffer the consequences of having broken that law.\u201d\nNow I\u2019m no pacifist when it comes to\nspeaking out against wrongs but is\nthis what a senior spokesman of the\nIslamic Human Rights Commision\nshould be encouraging us to do?\nThe next speaker who was dressed\nmore formally in suit and tie and who\nspoke very eloquently indeed was\nToufic Machnouk, the associate director of the Institute for Policy Research\nand Development. He had a few years\nago visited the College, linking what\nwas happening to the Palestinians with\nthe Holocaust and he didn\u2019t disappoint\nthis time round either. The Holocaust,\nwhich resulted in the death of over six\nmillion Jews as well as blacks, gays and\ngypsies, was an event which if educated\nabout goes beyond the simple numbers.\nIt was the dehumanisation of a people\nto not even animals. Those that don\u2019t\nunderstand why the Holocaust can in\nno way be compared with the situation\nin Gaza and the Palestinians, should\ngo visit Auschwitz, Birkenau , BergenBelsen, Majdanek, Treblinka etc... all\nthe different concentration camps and\ndeath camps. To desensitise what the\nHolocaust was in order to score political points is disgraceful and an insult\nto those that perished and those that\nsurvived.\nNot only did he equate the Holocaust with the events in Gaza but he\nwas very keen to talk about the \u201cJenin\nMassacre\u201d where it was believed that\nthe whole refugee camp of Jenin had\nbeen wiped out by Israel, where in fact\nnothing of the sort happened and was\nshown to be a complete lie.\nLie after lie and quotations taken\nout of context were used freely in his\nvery persuasive presentation. The sad\nthing was that the amount of time he\nspent talking about the plight of the\nGazans was minute compared to how\nlong he spent demonising Israel and\nits people. Another lost opportunity\nto talk about a necessary cause.\nIn a time where dialogue is necessary to promote strong connections\nbetween two sides it is irresponsible\nand extremely divisive for such hate\nspeech to be brandished. It is time for\nthe people who take sides to understand and talk about both sides ma-turely. Israel is not a perfect country\nbut which country is? Why is there not\na call to boycott the countries which\nmurder homosexuals, oppress women,\nban freedom of speech and freedom\nof expression? On the contrary, we\nshould be investing in both sides in order to forge strong bonds and to reach\na state of unity between two people.\nMaybe next year Gaza week will take\non a different stance, one to strive\ntowards positive rather than burying\ntheir heads in hate.\nStephenLongon the proposed smoking ban\nT\nhe other week, the idea of\nbanning smoking in our\nUnion Quad was mooted.\nOn Monday, a proposal\nwill be made to the Council to pass this into Union rules. This\nappears to me to be very ill thought-out, and hopefully after reading this\narticle, it will to you too.\nTo begin with a disclaimer: yes, I do\nenjoy having an occasional cigarette\nwith my pint, and my face will be\namongst those on the benches shivering the winter through. But my objection to a ban goes beyond \u201cI\u2019m too\nlazy to leave the quad to smoke\u201d.\nThe paper intends to be acting for\nthe welfare of Union members, by\ndiscouraging them from smoking,\nand also allowing non-smokers a\nmore pleasant environment. It says\nthat smokers block the entrances,\nrestricting access. It also states that\nsince the 2006 national smoking ban,\nbar takings have actually increased,\nwith the implication that a further\nincrease will result from a total ban.\nAt the moment, smokers usually\nsit on the benches on the north side\nof the quad. Generally, there is little\nconflict of smokers and non-smokers,\nas it\u2019s usually too cold to go outside\nfor no reason. Even come the summer,\npeople are generally decent enough to\nrespect each other\u2019s rights, both their\nright to smoke, and their right not to\nbe forced to breathe other\u2019s smoke.\nEverything is fairly peachy.\nBanning an activity will never stop\nits practice, merely move its location.\nThe consequence of a ban would be\nthat people would have to go out onto\nthe street to smoke, most likely Prince\nConsort Rd. I doubt this small inconvenience will persuade anyone to give\nup smoking (more likely they will\ngive up coming to the Union). What\nis inevitable is a sizeable crowd outside the main gates. This will restrict\naccess worse than the present situa-tion. Smokers and non-smokers alike\nwill have to barge their way through a\ncrowd of (in all likelihood) drinkers, a\npoor welcome to our Union.\nThere will be a constant flux of\npeople entering and leaving the Union, increasing the workload on the\ndoor staff. It will also bring loud\ntalking right under the noses of Beit\nresidences. At least only the rear\nbedrooms are currently disturbed\nby the nocturnal activities at the Union, moving smoking to the street\nwill bring similar disturbances to the\nfront bedrooms. There would also be\na huge increase in litter on the streets,\nsouring our relations with neighbours and the council. Also, policing\nthis ban would fall to the stewards,\nwho already have their work cut-out\nwith the thankless task of keeping us\nall safe whilst we drink. I think these\neffects would far outweigh the benefits of a smoke-free quad, and maybe\nfew less smokers.\nI think the overall result of a ban\nwould be more work for Union staff,\nmore disturbances for more Beit residents and greater inconvenience for\nnon-smokers, with very few people\nactually giving up and at the cost of\nsome loss of custom. A ban would\nsimply be counter-productive, despite being (laudably) intended to\nimprove students\u2019 lives, in fact, there\nwill be a net decrease in the overall\nquality of life.\nAs a further point, I don\u2019t think it is\nthe Union\u2019s place to be dictating our\nlifestyle choices, and doing so on the\ngrounds of health seems incongruous\nin a place with frequent \u201call you can\ndrink\u201d bar nights. I urge you to think\nabout the consequences of this ban,\nand don\u2019t allow it to pass Council.\nBen Gross on missed opportunities\n\u201cBanning an\nactivity will never\nstop its practice,\nmerely move its\nlocation.\u201d\n\u201c...the Holocaust\ncan in no way be\ncompared with the\nsituation in Gaza\u201d\n\n"

Paxman often starts\na question \u2018In maths...\u2019, or \u2018In physics...\u2019\netc. It puts us on the spot.\nIn a sense Amit and Good, who both\nstudy physics, had it easy; if they did\nnot know an answer to such a question,\nthen they could trust the other one to\njump in. However if neither of them\nknew the answer then it just must be\nparticularly obscure question.\u201d\nCiar\u00e1n: \u201cPersonally I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s\npossible to do much useful preparation\nwhen it comes to learning things, due\nto the sheer range of possible subjects\nfor ques- tions. However\nthere are things you can do in preparing for the quiz itself, being good at\nguessing is important and that partly\ncomes with doing practice questions,\nand we all improved our speed on\nthe buzzer by competing against each\nother in practice. I was actually pretty poor generally on my own subject,\nchemistry, I\u2019m pretty sure I got more\nwrong than right on it. Partly it\u2019s down\nto the fact that I was only a first year, or\nright at the start of second, when the\nfilming was done, and lots of science\nquestions \u2013 particularly for chemistry\n\u2013 seem to come from more difficult\nmaterial later on. \u201c\nGilead: \u201cAfter every match we played\nwe promised that we\u2019d definitely revise\nbefore the next one. That never hap-pened, of course, and so most of our\npreparation came from informal quiz-zing. When it comes to a show like\nUniversity Challenge, you either know\nyour general knowledge or you don\u2019t \u2013\nwhat distinguishes teams is how good\nthey are at making intelligent guesses\nand how fast they are on the buzzer.\u201d\nSimon: \u201cWe had sets of University\nChallenge-style questions that we went\nthrough as a team quite regularly, especially in the immediate run-up to\nthe matches. I think we used them to\nfamiliarise ourselves with the format\nof the show, rather than as a source of\nnew facts. Although a question we had\npracticed the day before did come up\nin one of our matches. I made very little preparation individually \u2013 I did not\ngo trawling through encyclopedias or\nanything like that. I just relied on what\nknowledge I already had. I think a lot\nof what I know comes from having had\nwide academic interests as a child \u2013 in\nfact, I think I picked\nGilead Amit\n(Team Captain)\nAge: 20\nCourse: Physics\nExtra-curricular interests:\nWriting for felix, getting involved\nwith Imperial\u2019s vastly under-appreciated Dramatic Society.\nWhich moment in UC so far are\nyou are most proud of?\nWhether owing to modesty or a\ngenuine (though unsuccessful)\nattempt at originality, we all\nclaim to be proudest of our close\nencounters of the third kind with\nJeremy Paxman. And what the hell,\nI\u2019m no different. One of the definite\nhighlights of the series for me was\nbeing able to talk to Jeremy Paxman\nbetween takes, though having him\nnonchalantly flirt with my girlfriend\nwas a little unexpected.\nAlthough he was more than happy\nto chat to us and very willing to sign\nthe umpteen autograph books and\nnameplates that were handed to\nhim, he drew the line at a copy of\nthe Daily Mail I ironically asked him\nto initial. After having persistently\nworn down his principles, however,\nI\u2019m proud to say I now have a copy\nof the Sun\u2019s TV guide which bears\nhis signature.\nHow important is winning?\nWinning a match on UC is\nunquestionably a great feeling, but\nI think you\u2019ve lost something much\nmore fundamental if just being\nable to take part doesn\u2019t ring your\nbuzzer.\nup most of my general knowledge\nwhen I was younger.\u201d\nfelix: Has Imperial contributed to\nthis width of knowledge in any aspect?\nFor instance, do you take any business,\nlanguage or humanities options?\nGilead: \u201cOne of my most cherished\nbeliefs \u2013 or in other words one of my\nprofoundest delusions \u2013 is that scientists can be better-equipped to answer questions on history or art than\nany politics student would be to face\na question on quantum physics. Scientists have a tremendous advantage\nin that respect, and it gives me a huge\namount of pleasure that we were able\nto show the world that four hard scientists and a fuel cell researcher can\ndiscuss Dante and Hobsbawm with the\nbest of them.\u201d\nBen: \u201cIt is a great asset that Imperial\nis in South Kensington, and generally\nLondon. I enjoy being able to go to the\nV&A and other museums in London.\nOne question was about a picture I had\nliterally seen the day before in the national gallery, although that question\nhas not been shown!\u201d\nEdward: \u201cI did take Chinese evening\nclasses for a term but I do not know\nhow much that will have helped!\u201d\nCiar\u00e1n: \u201cI am doing a humanities op-tion, politics, this year, and I did one in\nhistory last year. I am sure it helped a\nlittle, although I have always been interested in the humanities anyway, I almost chose to do a degree in history, so\nI have picked up lots of bits and pieces\nof information just from taking an interest in things.\u201d\nSimon: \u201cBesides physics, very little\nI think, though that is no fault of Imperial\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re meant to be given a\ngeneral knowledge of things at school,\nnot university. I do not take any non-physics options.\u201d\nWatch Imperial take on St. Hugh\u2019s, Oxford on Monday the 15th in dBs\n\n"

While it may\nseem incongruent that a Science, Engineering, Medicine and Business College based in central London would\nhave these it seems that our alumni\nwere leaving us an unsubtle hint to get\nout of the big city once in a while.\nThe Exploration Committee only\nmeets twice a year, but its expertise\ncan be sought year round. They are\nable to allocate money and equipment\nto expeditions but the members of the\nboard are also a wealth of knowledge\nand experience.\nBut what is it that they are looking\nfor? After all, it seems like the world\nis getting smaller and smaller and\nnot all of us can nip up to the top of\nthe tallest mountain. The committee\nis well aware of this, and states that\n\u2018other opportunities, including those\nfor culturally related exploration, still\nremain strong\u2019. The way that this is\nimplemented is with the mindset that\n\u2018it is appropriate to offer support for\nexpedition-type activities that nevertheless demonstrate certain aspects of\nexploration\u2019.\nHowever, one of the key features they\nare looking for is that it is your own\nidea, with your own planning and itinerary and should have clearly defined\naims and objectives. What they don\u2019t\nwant is to hear about the next holiday\nyou\u2019d like to go on or something that\nyou\u2019re doing for credit on your academic course.\nThe crazy thing is that there are some\nvery modest students in our midst who\nhave benefited from the committee. A\nbrief cross-section of trips have included a student-designed bridge-building\nproject in Altiplano, Bolivia, a filmed\ndocumentary of a remote indigenous\npopulation in Indonesia and most re-cently, an exploration of East Greenland, summitting three previously unexplored mountains.\nIf you have an idea that you think\nmight be of interest, you can check out\nthe website at www.ic.ac.uk/expedi-tions for more information.

[sic]\nMy dear James Lees [Politics Editor],\nI found \u2018felix\u2019 sitting in a carriage on the Central Line on friday (5th Feb.) and I picked it up and read your arti-cal with interest. I hope you don\u2019t mind me telling you that no Catholic bishop in England and Wales \u201cmaintain\nseats in the House of Lords, and as a result still have some say in the running of the country\u201d\n.\nIt is the Bishops of the Church of England who maintain seats in the House of Lords and, therefore, have some\nsay in the running of the country.\nWith kind regards,\nJohn Tuohy\nCatholic Priest\nDear John Tuohy,\nThank you very much in regards to your email about the article in felix. You are indeed correct that it is only Bishops of\nthe Church of England who hold seats in the House of Lords - the so-called \u2018Lords Spiritual\u2019. The error was due to having\nnot kept up with the story around Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O\u2019Connel. I had assumed (wrongly) that after he had been\noffered a position in the Lords and had been keen to take the position, he would now be seated in the House. It turns out\nthat the Pope (allegedly at least) barred the Cardinal from taking the position.\nAnyway, I\u2019m sure you knew all that as you correctly asserted there being no Catholic bishops in the Lords. My sincere\napologies for the mistake, and my sincere thanks for reading the article and getting in touch.\nKind regards,\nJames Lees, Politics Editor\nIC\u2019s Welsh advisory\nWelshman and Imperial professor\nJohn Harries (Chair in Earth Observation, Department of Physics) has been\nappointed as Wales\u2019 first Chief Scientific Adviser. He will take up the post\non 1st May, promoting science in the\npolicy-making of the Welsh assembly,\nand challenging ministers on their\ndecisions. In this post he will be the\nWelsh counterpart of England\u2019s Chief\nScientific Adviser John Beddington,\nalso a current professor at Imperial\n(Applied Population Biology).\nHarries has previously been President\nof the Royal Meteorological Society and\nthe International Radiation Commission, as well as being a fellow of the IOP\nand winning its Charles Chree Medal\nand Prize. Other high profile positions\nhave included Associate Director and\nHead of the Space Science Department\nat the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory\nand Director of Projects and Technology at the British National Space Centre. He is particularly well known for\nleading the team which published the\nfirst observational evidence of increase\nin the Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect in 2001\nfor records between 1970 and 1997.\nThe appointment comes three years\nafter former first minister Rhodri\nMorgan first commissioned a report\nin 2007 into whether Wales needs a\ngovernmental scientific adviser at all,\nfollowing the appointment of Scotland\u2019s first Chief Scientific Adviser in\n2006. The news also comes after much\nspeculation last year that the Welsh assembly would eliminate the position\ndue to a lack of funds.\nHarries has said of his appointment,\n\u201cWales is a small country, but is capable of the intelligent application of new\nscience and engineering as a basis for\ngreater commercial success in industry\n... This is a job that encompasses two\n(along with my family and rugby) of my\ngreat passions \u2013 science and Wales.\u201d\nGovernmental scientific advisers\nremain in the spotlight after the debacle in October when Professor David\nNutt was sacked from the chair of the\nAdvisory Council on the Misuse of\nDrugs for expressing his professional\nopinion. After the resignation of five\nof the committee, it is in danger of\nlosing two more scientists this week,\nafter governmental proposals have\nbeen slammed for being designed to\nstop advisers publicly disagreeing\nwith government policy.\nRox Middleton\nRox Middleton\nDon\u2019t forget, your name suggestions for the new Union bars:\n1.

This simply sounds wrong, terribly wrong. Wrong that he was let off in\nthe first place for a crime he quite clearly\ncommited (CCTV footage showed Mr\nMiah striking Mr Furcan twice), but also\nwrong that he was excused because he\nhad just been at his local mosque.\nIs it that unreasonable to suggest that\nsomeone of faith is less likely to offend\nthan a non-believer? Maybe not, but\nyou know that this is going to be treading very dodgy ground. The ruling has\nbeen taken as unfairly discriminative\nby the NSS (National Secular Society)\nand you can clearly see their point.\nCan\u2019t someone have morals without\nbelief in a religion?\nOn the other hand I guess it is convenient to make generalisations. Like any\nfollower of Anwar al-Awlaki must be\ndangerous, right? In this case my opinion\nwould be yes. But principles like these\ncannot be applied across the board.\nCo-incidentally, however, findings\npublished in the journal \u2018Trends in\nCognitive Sciences\u2019 this week claim\nthat atheists are \u201cjust as ethical as\nchurch-goers\u201d. According to the study,\npeople who have no religion know\ntheir right from their wrong just as well\nas those who worship regularly.\nThe researchers found that most religious people were similar in having a\nmoral code, which helped to organize\nsociety. However, people from a non-Dr Jane Murray \u2013 a researcher from the University of Bristol \u2013 has published a paper in which\nshe claims that cat owners are likely to be smarter than dog owners. This was based on a poll of\n2,524 households wherein a larger proportion of\nthe households with cats had people in poses-sion of a degree. She claims that well educated\npeople prefer cats because they \u201cwork\nlate and have long commutes, and\nbecause cats require less time per\nday spent on them than a dog\u201d. I tell\nyou what, if that rubbish counts\nas scientific research then\nmaybe I\u2019ve got a career in research lying in wait for me\nafter all.\nBodywork batteries\nResearchers at Imperial College are developing a prototype\nmaterial which may change the way we powereveryday\nitems. The material, made from carbon fibres and polymer resin, will be both strong and lightweight, making it\na possible future alternative to the electric motors currently used in hybrid cars. Dr Greenhalgh, department of\naeronautics, says: \u2018We think the car of the future could be\ndrawingpowerfromitsroof,itsbonnetoreventhedoor...\u2019\nThe uses of the new material would not be limited to the\nmotor industry. The material could enable items such\nas mobile phones to be powered by\ntheir casing, giving future\nphones the\npotential to\nbe as thin as\ncredit cards.\nBadger culls\nineffective\nlongterm\nCat owners smarter\nthan dog owners?\nResearch published on Wednesday by\nImperial College and the Zoological Society of London has shown that the benefits\nof badger culling to reduce instances of\ntuberculosis in cattle disappear within\nfour years of the cull. In 2008, over 2,700\nherds were infected with the disease\nand were slaughtered, costing the Government \u00a3100 million as a result. Badger\nculling was decided against as a means of\ncontrolling cattle TB in England two years\nago, but the Welsh Assembly is now proposing to use culling methods similar to\nthose used in the study.\nIn brief\nAre she having a laugh?\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\nM\nany human traits pose\nan evolutionary paradox\nand one such example is\ndepression. Research in\nthe US and elsewhere estimates that between 30 and 50 percent of people meet\npsychiatric diagnostic criteria for a major depressive disorder at some point in\ntheir lives. However, the brain has a crucial role in personal survival and reproduction so evolutionary pressure should\nhave developed the brain\u2019s resistance to\nthese problems. Mental disorders should\nbe rare so why isn\u2019t depression?\nThe existence of mental health problems would make evolutionary sense if\nthey were due to growing old as functionality of organs tends to deteriorate\nwith age. However, in the case of de-pression, people are most likely to have\ntheir first experience during adolescence and young adulthood. Equally,\na theory that it is a modern phenomenon developed through our new lifestyles is flawed as symptoms of depression have been found in every culture,\nincluding the Ache of Paraguay and\nthe Kung of southern Africa \u2013 societies\nthought to live in environments similar\nto those in our evolutionary past.\nThe remaining possibility is that in\nmost instances, depression is not a\ndisorder at all. In an article published\nin Psychology Review, it is argued\nthat depression is an adaption that\nbrings real costs and real benefits.\nOne reason to suggest that depression is an adaption comes\nfrom research into a molecule in the brain known\nas 5HT1A \u2013 a receptor that\nbinds to serotonin, a neurotransmitter\nlinkedtodepression.Thischemicalisthe\ntarget of most contemporary antidepressant medications. When the receptor in\nrodents is compared to that in humans,\nit is 99 percent similar, suggesting that it\nis so important that natural selection has\npreserved it. The ability to be depressed\nappears to be important, not an accidental malfunction.\nDepression does cause problems for\nthose who suffer the disorder, so what\ncould be useful about depression? Depressed individuals often think intensely\nand analytically about their problems,\nbreaking down the complexities of the\nsituation into smaller components con-sideredoneatatime.Thistypeofthought\ncan be very productive. Research has\nfound evidence that people who get more\ndepressed while they are working on\ncomplex problems in an intelligence test\ntend to score higher on the test.\nThis type of analysis requires uninterrupted thought, and depression coordinates physiological changes to help\npeople not be distracted. In a region\nof the brain known as the ventrolateral\nprefrontal cortex (VLPFC), neurons\nmust be continuously firing to avoid\ndistraction. However, this is very energetically demanding for these neurons\nand can cause them to degrade. Studies\nin rats\nhave shown that the 5HT1A receptor is\ninvolved in supplying neurons with the\nfuel they need to perform at this level.\nThese processes are important to allow\ndepressive analytical thought to continue uninterrupted with minimal neuron damage, which may explain why\n5HT1A is evolutionarily important.\nAgainst this background, other\nsymptoms of depression make evolutionary sense. The desire for social\nisolation and the inability to derive\npleasure from activities including sex\nprevent distractions and encourage\ndeep thought about an individual's\nproblems. Several studies have found\nthat this depressive rumination allows\nfor quicker resolution of depression.\nVarious studies have also shown that\npeople in depressed mood states are\nmore proficient at solving social dilem-mas. This may be important enough\nto drive the evolution of such a costly\nmental state. Laboratory experiments\nindicate that depressed people are better at resolving these situations due to\nbetter analysis of the costs and benefits\nof different actions that they may take.\nUnfortunately, often people are reluctant to disclose the reasons for their depression due to embarrassment, or a belief that they must soldier on and ignore\nthe emotions. However, depression is a\nnatural way of indicating that you have\na complex social problem that the\nbrain is intent on solving. The\ncondition is a huge problem for\nsufferers and one which should\nbe taken seriously. However,\nwhen considering all the evidence\ndepression seems less like a dis-order, and more like a highly\norganised response that performs a specific function.\nThe winter blues evolution\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack\nreligious background were also found\nto have intuitive judgements of right\nand wrong, to a similar extent.\nDr Marc Hauser from Harvard University, one of the co-authors of the research,\nstated that he and his colleagues were interested in the roots of religion and mo-rality. He claims that \u201cFor some, there is\nno morality without religion, while others see religion as merely one way of expressing one\u2019s moral intuitions\u201d\n.\nThe team looked at a number of psychological studies which were designed\nto test an individual\u2019s morality. Dr Hauser\nadded: \u201cThe research suggests that intuitive judgments of right and wrong seem\nto operate independently of explicit religious commitments.

Tribesmen residing deep in the jungle await the\nreturn of Prince Philip, whom they worship as a god.\nI was about to come face-to-face with\nthe alleged birthplace of the Duke of\nEdinburgh.\nThe rancid sulphuric aromas could not\nhave signified the presence of the volcano better than the smog surrounding it.\nEven the rustle of gusts of wind, battering\nagainst our will to hoist ourselves to the\nsummit, could not eclipse the grumble\nthat droned, brewed in those pools of lava\nbeyond the reach of our eyes. It occasionally pampered its spectators with the odd\nsplutter; and then, just as the cramping\narms yielded and cameras stooped, the\nhalo of smoke would radiate, swiftly pursued by a cascade of molten rocks showered beyond the crater.

It is impossible to capture the essence of Rome\nin these places. I am often told by people\nwho have visited Rome that it is a noisy\nand chaotic city \u2013 that is true if you stick\nto the traditional tourist trek. If you wander just a short distance away from the\nmain attractions you will discover the\ntrue atmosphere of Rome, an atmosphere\ncomposed of silence, unexpected sights\nand romantic scenarios (not saying that\njust because we are close to St. Valentine\u2019s Day).\nFrom the Circus Maximus walk up the\nAventino Hill along Via Clivo dei Publicii. After a slight bend keep right along\nVia di Santa Sabina and after 5 minutes you will have reached Piazza Pietro\nd\u2019Illiria (named after a Dalmatian priest\nfrom the 5th\ncentury). Once you are in the\nsquare take a quick look inside the Basilica of Santa Sabina, then enter the gates on\nthe right side of the square. These gates\nare the entrance to a small, symmetrical\ngarden called Giardino degli Aranci \u2013\nliterally translated as \u2018Orange Garden\u2019.\nThe garden offers a quiet and contemplative atmosphere that is centuries away\nfrom the noisy motorcycle-packed Rome.\nWalk around the orange trees but avoid\neating the oranges because they are very\nbitter (at least the ones I tried were) and\nthen enjoy the panoramic view of Rome\nfrom the Belvedere. If you have some\nextra time to spare leave the garden and\nwalk along Via di Santa Sabina, in the\nopposite direction from which you came\nfrom, until you reach a small square\nwhere the road terminates. In this square\nyou will notice a big green gate surmounted by a large arch. This gate leads to the\nheadquarters of the Knights of Malta. If\nyou approach the gate and look through\nthe keyhole you\u2019ll see the best thing one\ncan possibly see from a keyhole: St Peter\u2019s\nDome in all its magnificence.\nthe embarrassment, we waited, before yet\nanother explosion some ten minutes later\nknocked me off my balance again.\nI must confess how appropriately put\nwere Esiegel\u2019s words.Being his ninth\nvisit, Mt. Yasur held a special place in\nEsiegel\u2019s heart. Sickened by his alcoholic\nviolent old life, he travelled, serendipi-tously stumbling across Tanna. Its mystical lures kept him there for a six-month\nplacement and, becoming connected\nwith the environment himself, he rectified his ways and enriched himself with\nphilosophy, taking inspiration from the\nextraordinary feats nature had fashioned\non the island. The volcano, he observed,\nsymbolised our vulnerability and miniscule presence in time - it inspired the\nformer materialist to become a devotee\nof minimalism. Even as nightfall drew its\ncurtain we stood our ground. The scarlet hue began to smoulder. Soon our eyes\nwere spoiled to the night-time fireworks,\nits majesty magnifying one eruption after\nanother. It could\u2019ve been a textbook recital of scientific knowledge. Rather, as the\nstoic did, I let nature indulge my senses.\nDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve seen a post office anywhere on the volcano have you?\nAn Insider\u2019s Haunt: Rome, Italy\nEdoardo Borgomeo\nEdoardo Borgomeo\n\n"

Mouth watering. The\nbubble of hype surrounding the Super\nBowl was different though. It was mas-sive. Everything is epic, from the build\nup, the stats upon stats, this year\u2019s story of Katrina and New Orleans, right\nthrough to the half time The Who con-cert. They even celebrate every tackle.\nIt\u2019s the way they do things over there.\nSuch incredible, often ridiculous\nhype does seem to work for the Super\nBowl though, creating an exciting atmosphere of fervour. Though I don\u2019t\nknow what it\u2019s like most years, or indeed most games, for me Super Bowl\n44 did not disappoint.\nPre-match the Indianapolis Colts\nwere favoured over the New Orleans\nSaints, with quarterback Peyton Manning apparently one of the greatest of\nthe game and a cert to be inducted into\nthe hall of fame. A record distance pass\nfrom Manning soon saw a touchdown\nthat had the Colts ahead and after two\nkicks from someone for the Saints, the\ngame went into half time at 10-6 Colts.\nThe actual \u2018football\u2019 seems to be only\nhalf the spectacle for America though.\nThe game is constantly punctuated\nby advert breaks, a trait I couldn\u2019t understand before watching \u2018football\u2019\nthough which I now see as natural for\nsuch a short play game. In much of the\npre- and post-match media these adverts themselves somehow seemed to\ngenerate stories. Acts such as Michael\nand Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake,\nBeyonce, Prince and now The Who\nmean that half time is barely even a\nbreak for the record millions of armchair viewers across America, and in-creasingly, the world.\nThe 2nd half kicked off as if we\u2019d\nnever left as Saints\u2019 coach Sean Payton,\nwho had already showed his willingness to innovate earlier in the game,\nsent instructions to open with an on-side kick. This is essentially a short\nkick aimed at keeping possession rather than limiting the opponent\u2019s yards,\nusually reserved for late desperation.\nThe move succeeded, however and in\nthe following play the Saints scored a\ntouchdown and successfully converted\nto pull 13-10 ahead. A game changer\nthat was as thrilling to watch as Felix\nis to read.\nBy the time Tracy Porter\u2019s interception and subsequent run had secured\nthe Super Bowl for the Saints (ironi-cally off a Manning throw) I , as well\nas many others in the union I\u2019m sure ,\nhad long been convinced by American\nFootballs epic claims to greatness.\nAnd so the greatest show on the\nplanet is over. I might just grow my\nhair, break out the black greasepaint\nand join American football soc. Until then. Eastside for Tottenham vs.\nWigan?\n\u201cEverything is epic,\nfrom the build-up\nto...The Who. They\neven celebrate\nevery tackle. It\u2019s the\nway they do things\nover there.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "the Rector\u2019s Cup had a short, but illustrious history. Out of the 15 years\nit ran, the Royal School of Mines won\nthe Rector\u2019s Cup for 11 years of those\nyears and shared the trophy with the\nCity and Guilds for one of them. But\nhow was it that a Faculty which only\nhad 250 students at the time were able\nto produce such great results in the\nboxing? Here we have the recollections\nof Jim Platt, a Mining Geology student\nbetween 1957-1960.\n\u201cThough the RSM was numerically\nB\nlood, sweat and beers. If\nthere were ever three words\nthat would describe the\nRector\u2019s Cup, they would\nbe it. Last week, we discovered the wonder that was Morphy Day\nand how it was a sporting and social\nhighlight for half a century. But what of\nthe other events? This week, we delve\ninto the sweet science that is boxing.\nDuring the late 1940\u2019s and early\n1950\u2019s, Imperial\u2019s boxing club was at\nit\u2019s peak as Fred Carr, the IC Boxing\nClub Captain in 1954 explains:\n\u201cIn the past this college has had very\nstrong and good boxing teams, and\nin the last few years it has constantly\nbeen winners or runners-up in the\nU.A.U. [University Athletic Unions]\nBoxing Championships, and many\nof our members have boxed for the\nUniversity.\u201d\nThe strength of the Imperial Boxing\nClub and the endless stream of champions seemed to stem from the grass\nroutes within the College itself. Towards the end of the second term, the\nthree faculty colleges would convene\nupon the Union and watch the students beat the living daylights out of\neach other whilst enjoying a few kegs\nof beer. All the while, the Rector of the\nCollege would join in with them and\nin fact present the eventual winning\nclub captain and the best boxer of the\nevening, with a trophy, hence why the\nevent was called the Rector\u2019s Cup.\nFrom the felix archive, it seems that\nSports of Yesteryear: Rector\u2019s Cup\n1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\nHistory of Boxing & Rector\u2019s Cup:\nCall yourselves boxers? You should see Bobby, that man can piss his name in\nconcrete. He scares me...\nKey\nRoyal School of Mines\nCity and Guilds\nRoyal College of Science\nat the foot of the totem pole it had\nno impact on the RSM in the Rector\u2019s\nCup, as we regularly took the tournament by storm. This feat of conquest\nwas achieved by us entering more contestants for the tournament than the\nother two colleges combined were able\nto muster. It was considered a matter\nof duty for any \u2018Mines\u2019 man to declare\nhimself ready to box.\u201d\nAnd so the secret of the Miners success is made evident, shear numbers,\nalthough why the other two faculties\nnever figured this out is beyond me.\nOr maybe, they did and they simply\nchose to enter into a fight with a Miner... Although don\u2019t let this fool you,\neven though the Miners did have more\nentrants than any other faculty, those\nthat they did enter were actually good.\nThe majority of the Imperial boxing\nteam were actually composed of Miners, with Len Palmer winning the UAU\nFeather-weight Championship two\nyears on the trot.\nSetting aside the prowess of the\nImperial Club, what about the Rector\u2019s Cup, was it a big deal. In 1955,\nfor the first time in the history of the\nRector\u2019s Cup the tournament was held\nunder the auspices of the Amateur\nBoxing Association who supplied the\nofficials, thus improving the quality\nof the evening. Considering also that\nthe Rector actually attended the event\nI would imagine so, and if Jim Platt\u2019s\ntestimony is anything to\ngo by, it seems that the\nrivalry was huge.\n\u201c [I] was lucky to survive round one and ended up being counted out in\nround two when the referee\nstopped the fight in my opponent\u2019s favour. I thought it would\nbe appropriate to make a protest to the\ndecision, but in truth I was glad that\nthe bout was over. The one good thing\nwas that I went down to a man from\nGuilds, leaving me thankful for the\nsmall mercy that an RCS man was not\nin the opposite corner.\u201d\nAlthough the crowds that attended\nwere not in the same league as that of\nMorphy Day, the rivalry was. But, although it seemed that there was promise for this event to last the test of time,\nit suddenly stopped in 1963, after there\nwas not enough committee members\nto run the event, although the Boxing\nClub continued for some years. The\nevent had died out, most likely due to\na combination of things; not enough\ninterest for people to enter, most likely\ndue to the Miners always having more\nentrants than the other two faculties\ncombined. Or maybe it was the fact\nthat the only protection they received\nin the ring were the gloves on their\nhands, as we can clearly see from the\npictures that they didn\u2019t wear any head\ngear.

Here you can see the crab roe in all its glory; visit the place and you can enjoy its glorious taste.\nThe age old debate about Dim Sum\nD\nim Sum. There\u2019s little debate that it is surely one\nof China\u2019s greatest contributions to world cui-sine. But If I was to perform a little survey amongst London\u2019s\nChinese community about which restaurant serves the best Dim Sum, I\u2019m\npretty sure I could start a little debate\nof my own. Even in my own mind, a\nfierce quabble rages over where to find\nthe best of these fine creations. After\nmuch contemplation, day-dreaming\nand general pondering, I can\u2019t say that\nthere is one particular place which ticks\nevery box. If only there was a way to\ncreate the perfect place for Dim Sum,\nby hand-picking the most noteworthy\ncreations from some of London\u2019s most\nrevered Chinese restaurants\u2026\nI can remember the taste of Imperial\nChina\u2019s \u2018Wu Kok\u2019 (taro croquette) as\nif it graced my tongue only moments\nbefore writing this article. Puffy, crispy\npastry encapsulates an unctuously rich\ntaro packed centre, brought to life with\na few salty punctuations of pork. Their\nsteamed items are also worth shouting about. Not many other London\neateries create Siu Mai (\u2018Prawn and\nPork Dumplings\u2019) where the individual\nelements aren\u2019t masked by a tad too\nmuch pork fat. The juicy meat of the\npig, sweet prawn, earthy mushroom\nand delectable crab roe are all easily identifiable. Also worthy of filling\nyour tummy is their \u2018Har Kau\u2019, prawn\ndumplings composed of juicy, sizeable\nprawns, a featherlike touch of garlic\nand not-overly-sticky translucent skin.\nRoyal China (Bayswater or Baker\nSt branch) produces some pretty top\nnotch \u2018Char Siu\u2019 (barbequed pork),\nand its no surprise that their \u2018Char Siu\nBao\u2019 (Steamed Roast Pork Bun) and\n\u2018Char Siu So\u2019 (Roast Pork Puffs) are\nsome of the best I\u2019ve tried. Every time\nI eat either of their renditions of these\ndishes, an explosion of flavours engulfs\nmy mouth upon penetration of the\ncloud-like softness of the exterior of\nIt might not be a Chinese New Year speciality, but Chris Sim tends to eat a whole lot more of it at this time of year\nthe former and the crispily rich pasty\nof the latter, with juicy and salty sensations of the pork awakening your pal-ette, quickly mellowed by the soothing\nsweetness of the gooey sauce.\n\u2018Cheung Fun\u2019 (steamed rice noodle\nrolls filled with either prawn, char siu\nor dough stick, in a soy based sauce)\nis generally of a pleasing standard in\nLondon, but there is one restaurant\nwhich gets it spot on. In my opinion,\nthe secret of the Dragon Palace\u2019s (Earl\u2019s\nCourt) Cheung Fun is to make the rice\nroll amazingly thin and slick. In doing\nso, the rice roll doesn\u2019t fill your mouth\nwith an unpleasantly gloopy ball of\nstarch but instead creates a wonderful textural combination of smooth\nroll and firm filling, brought to life by\nthe soy-based sauce. Also worthy of\na tasting is their \u2018Lo Bak Ko\u2019 (Turnip\nPaste Cake), whose subtly sweet turnip paste, dotted with salty hotspots\nof Chinese sausage, is beautifully cara-melised to create a truly moreish taste\nsensation.\nAt this point, some of you may be\nwondering where Golden Dragon fits\ninto this equation. Well, their \u2018Lo Mai\nKai\u2019, an expertly engineered banana\nleaf housing voluptuous sticky glutinous rice, prawn, Chinese sausage\nand mushroom, should definitely be\nordered. Their \u2018Dan Tart\u2019 (egg custard\ntart) provides a timely and sweet treat\nat the end of a meal. The secret of their\nsuccess is to use a flaky pastry and a\nsweet, wobbly, yet not too soft filling.\nDim Sum is never complete without\nsome quality Chinese tea. Yauatcha\nreally stands out in this department,\nthough this level of decadence requires a slightly larger foray into your\nbank account than you might usually\nbe prepared to embark upon. Whether you pick a classic such as green or\nsomething slightly less mundane such\nas Oolong blue, the quality is evident\nfrom your first sip.\nTo complete the perfect Dim Sum\nexperience, I feel that Imperial China\nprovides the perfect setting. It might\nnot quite have the class of Yauatcha,\nbut it has some of that lively atmosphere which I feel gives it a slightly\nmore authentic touch. While my\ndream to combine all these dishes into\none conveniently brilliant Dim Sum\nestablishment might not be the most\nlikely of prospects, it does indicate\none thing: London has the key skills to\ncreate this brilliant meal and with a little more TLC and probably at a much\nloftier price, the perfect Dim Sum experience can be created.\nRestaurant Review of Joy King Lau, from a vegetarian viewpoint\nHolly Cumbers offers a non-carnivorous opinion of the Chinese creations that this restaurant has to offer\nI\nf you are looking for somewhere\nto celebrate the Chinese New\nYear then I would suggest that\nJoy King Lau is at least worthy\nof your consideration. Okay, it is\nrenowned for bad service, but on the\nplus side the food is excellent value for\nmoney and there is plenty of choice\n(perhaps too much!). The restaurant\nis split over three floors and is always\npopular, which may mean you might\ntake a while to get served, however it is\nquiet enough to hold a proper conver-sation. The restaurant caters for both\nvegetarians and non-vegetarians (un-fortunately I won\u2019t be able to comment\non the meat, however my fellow diners\ninformed me that their food was very\ngood indeed!).\nI visited on a Sunday afternoon,\nwhich seems to be a popular time\nfor the Dim Sum menu. Dim Sum\nis great for sharing, it can either be\neaten as a midday snack or as an accompaniment to a main meal. The\nDim Sum is divided into categories:\nfried, steamed and \u2018Cheung Fun\u2019, and\nwith prices starting from just \u00a32, this\nrepresents pretty good value. If you\nhaven\u2019t tried them before I would\nsuggest trying the vegetarian dumplings which are basically rolls made\nout of rice that are also very slippery!\nFillings can be added to them such\nas vegetables, prawns or, if you are\nfeeling adventurous enough, shark\nfin.\nUnfortunately I didn\u2019t manage to\ntry the deep fried custard buns, but\nthey did sound interesting!\nAs for their mains, I personally did\nnot enjoy the monk style vegetables\n- I felt they had a slightly funny flavour to them and were a bit boring.\nHowever I did enjoy the sweet and\nsour beancurd, a classic Chinese dish\nwhich I never seem to get bored of.\nThe tofu had an excellent texture and\nthe sauce was nice, however the dish\ndidn\u2019t contain much pineapple. There\nare various other vegetarian dishes\nwhich you may also like, such\nas asparagus with straw\nmushrooms and cloud\near mushrooms -this dish sounds\nextremely exotic,\nit may be worth\nasking the waiters\nwhat a particular dish\nis like if you are curious.\nIf you want them to decide\nwhat you\u2019re going to eat there\nis a vegetarian set meal, you seem\nto get a lot of food and it is relatively\ncheap. It includes dishes such\nas spring rolls, beancurd and seaweed\n- however it doesn\u2019t appear to include\nany Dim Sum, so you might want to\nget this as well. For the carnivore in\nyou, I have been told the fried crystal prawns are definitely worth trying,\nbut if seafood isn\u2019t your thing then the\nfillet steak with black pepper is also\na flavoursome dish well worth a\ntry.\nFor something to refresh you\nafter all that food, the Chinese\ngreen tea is exceedingly\ngood value at just\n50p per cup,\nwith\nfree refills. Not only is it ridiculously\ncheap but it also adds to the Chinese\nfeel! If you don\u2019t fancy tea there are\nplenty of other traditional Chinese\ndrinks, not to mention the Chinese beer which, unsur-prisingly, is slightly\nmore expen-sive. So all in all, I felt this place represented pretty decent value and was\ndefinitely worth the visit.\n\n"

We\u2019re\nall very aware of Bangladesh\u2019s\npoverty, floods and susceptibility to\nclimate changes. In fact, Bangladesh\nhas contributed marginally nothing\nto global warming, yet will be affected\nthe most, and most catastrophically.\nIn light of this we, the IC Bangladeshi\nSociety, thought it was appropriate to\nput on a debate titled \u201cCan Bangladesh\nDevelop Independently?\u201d (held on 2nd\nFeb. \u201810). For our event we had two experts of their field speak: Sandra from\nBRAC, which is an international nongovernmental organisation (NGO)\nand Mujib (a financial consultant). It\nwas a very refreshing talk and I think\nthe audience left informed. I\u2019m writing\nthis article hoping that other societies\nmight take up points made in the talk\nand maybe discuss it further.\nMujib started the talk with a very\nblunt refutation, saying \u201cThe title is\ninvalid. Bangladesh has no choice but\nto develop, and develop independently.\u201d He mentioned a survey (by Demos,\npublished in The Sunday Times, 6th\nDec. \u201898) which found that Bangladeshis were the happiest people on\nearth; this survey was taken not too\nlong after a recent flood. I definitely\nthink this needed explaining, and so\n\u201cthis is because all that the people require is some land to farm on, and it\njust takes one season to re-grow your\ncrops\u201d. The people are Muslims, they\nhave faith in Allah and what He preordains for them, and they start to\nplough the land again.\nSandra\u2019s take on the debate was\nthat \u201calthough Bangladesh is an overwhelmingly Muslim majority country,\nthere are many non-Muslims too; all\nhave their own cultures and deep-root-ed practices. Bangladesh is becoming\nmodern by the day, but is steeped in\nthe past. Bangladesh should develop,\nbut not in isolation.\u201d\nFrom here on the debate became\nvery frank and detailed and I think this\nis where, I for one, would like to see\nfurther events on the international role\nin keeping countries like Bangladesh\ndependent on foreign aid and interfer-ence. Accusations were made against\nthe likes of the IMF, World Bank and\nother donors which give loans with\nstrings attached in the guise of Structural Adjust Programmes (SAP) and\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Papers\n(PRSP); all of which end up recuperating the money (and more) for the\ndonor countries through consultancy\nfees!. Bangladesh in general hasn\u2019t suffered from the international recession\n(as it\u2019s not big on the international financial market). One way of making\nBangladeshis feel the recession is to\nmake them take up small loans, but in\nlarge numbers. This is done through\nNGOs (like BRAC and Grameen Bank)\nthrough micro-credit and -finance;\nheavily encouraged by rich Western\nnations. Accusations were levelled\nagainst USAID which seeks to create a\ndependency on US foreign aid and specific products from a grass-roots level;\none example being the Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) programme. Through\nthe VAD programme, fortified flour, oil\nand milk is sold through NGO shops to\nthe locals; of course the Vitamin A can\nonly come from the USA.\nThe government of Bangladesh didn\u2019t\nescape from being lambasted in the debate either. If all the people require is\na piece of land to sweat and toil over,\nthen why is the government of Bangladesh withholding 3.4million acres of\nland from the public? For whose benefit is it being withheld? Karl Marx got\na bashing too and the concept equality\n(pushed by Communists) was refuted,\nin that \u201cpeople are not equal, everyone\nis unique and have different talents\u201d.\nWe had a good audience-participation\nbut a question which came up and\nagain was that \u201cCan the Khilafah (Is-lamic State) be established in Bangladesh?\u201d and \u201cHow realistic is it to call\nfor Islamic solutions to Bangladesh\u2019s\nproblems?\u201d\nIn conclusion: I think we all agreed\nthat for people to be independent they\nneed a vision; the public need to buy\ninto that vision and the leadership need\nto drive the people with objectives inline with that vision. Inevitably this\nwill mean that some will become your\nfriends and some, your foes; you can\nallow foreign advice, but not foreign\ninterference. If Bangladesh can do this,\nthen yes, it can develop independently.\nChemSoc and Joe Rumer raid college archives under Sherfield\nS\nome say there\u2019s a nuclear\nbunker under the Queen\u2019s\nLawn, others say there are\nfiling cabinets full of old archived papers. I don\u2019t know if\neither is true, but I do know if you head\ndown some empty corridors in Sherfield you will come to a large model of\na fish, some chemical samples from the\n1800s and a picture of how beautiful\nour college was before they knocked\ndown the buildings that once framed\nthe Queen\u2019s Tower.\nThis mysterious place is the college\narchives, now you can\u2019t nose about\nyourself as you probably have dirty\nundergraduate hands, but a very helpful lady can solve your qualms. And\nours was to find the original coat of\narms or crest for the Royal College of\nChemistry.\nBored of seeing a feeble pick axe\nand hammer paraded by the common\nmanual labourers in the Royal School\nof Mines we felt the need to establish\nour illustrious history. After all, (ignor-ing the unworthy medics) Chemistry is\nthe oldest department at Imperial, dating back to the founding of the College\nin 1845. Being a Royal body one would\nexpect a glowing crest, like that of the\nRSC with a beautiful lady, phoenix rising out of the fire and sexy benzene\nring.\nAlas the College archives couldn\u2019t\nhelp us, but a bit of research lead us\nto a blue plaque in Oxford St. on the\nformer site of the Royal College, which\nsadly now is a Moss Bros. suit outlet.\nTotal fail. Snooping around our own\ndepartment found very little too, even\nthe foundation stone of the original\nCollege (which now sits happily in\nRCS1) has no emblem.\nAnd then we found it: on the original\nlecture notes of August von Hofmann,\nthe first Professor of the Royal College, a couple pages in after a picture of\nanother lady (less beautiful this time),\nwas printed a small seal. To this day we\ndon\u2019t know who the lady is, perhaps an\nAncient Goddess, or maybe just the\ncollege secretary. But the ChemSoc\ncrest had been found\u2026\n\u2018The title is invalid.\nBangladesh has no\nchoice but to de-velop, and develop\nindependently.\u2019\nThe cover poster for the talk.

Like Edward, I\nwould describe myself as a Libertarian but I found it difficult to sympa-thise with the arguments in his article.\nProperty rights don\u2019t exist just to protect scarce resources nor do they usually lead to stagnation and problems\nof \u201cnavigating a minefield of existing\nintellectual property\u201d. In this article, I\nwant to tackle some of his arguments.\nI also argue that intellectual property\nrights are actually consistent with a\nLibertarian philosophy \u2013 rather than\nhindering free speech and free thought\nas Edward suggests, I believe it promotes it.\nEdward first argued that property\nexists primarily to allocate scarce resources between people and to prevent\nconflicts over that scarcity. He then\nwent on to briefly mention what I believe to be the more important point:\nthat property rights exist also to promote development and investment.\nMost economists now agree that in order for countries to develop, property\nrights must exist and there must be a\nstrong system of institutions to regulate them.\nLet us look back to the 18th century\nwhen property rights and enclosure of\nfarmland were introduced during the\nBritish Agricultural Revolution. Before\nenclosure, it made no sense for a farmer to invest in improving the yield of\nthe common land \u2013 he bears the costs\nof the investment himself but the benefits are equally shared between every-one. So, imagine a town of 100 farmers\nsharing common land.\nEach individual farmer could choose\nto make a \u00a31 investment in improving\nthe land which would give a total return of \u00a310. Without ownership rights,\nevery farmer benefits equally from the\nimprovement in the common land so\nthey share the \u00a310 return equally (each\nfarmer makes 10p).\nOf course, the investment never happens because the farmer making that\ninvestment spends \u00a31 and gets just 10p\nback.\nWhat if we replay the scenario with\nproperty rights? We have 100 separate\nenclosed farms. Each individual farmer would now be happy to make a \u00a31\ninvestment knowing they will get the\nfull \u00a310 return from the land. All 100\nfarmers choose to make that invest-ment. The net effect to society is we\nnow have 100 farmers investing a total\nof \u00a3100 and getting a return of \u00a31,000\n(lots more food production!). In this\ncase, it is obvious that the main benefit\nof property rights is not the allocation\nof scarce resources \u2013 sharing the common land with 100 farmers (essentially\neach having a 1% stakeholding in it)\nis as fair an allocation as each farmer\nphysically owning 1% of the land. In\nthis case, the additional investment\ncaused by property rights is the primary benefit to society.\nWe can draw a parallel scenario with\nmodern society here. James Cameron\u2019s\nAvatar cost $237million to produce\nand has taken revenues of about $2100\nmillion. If there were no intellectual\nproperty rights on Avatar, anybody\ncould decide to distribute Avatar and\nmake a profit from it. Imagine that\n20th Century Fox and 99 other companies are distributing Avatar and make\nequal revenue\u2026 20th Century Fox,\nwho produced the film, takes $21mil-lion revenue on that $237million\ninvestment.\nDo you really think that the film\nwould have been produced? This\neconomic argument shows that intellectual property rights are vital to the\nproduction of the intellectual property\nin the first place.\nAlthough the final film is not a scarce\nresource (it can be illegally copied at\nclose to zero cost), the factors of production (i.e. the time spent producing\nit and the investment in technology)\nare scarce resources. People simply\nwon\u2019t give up their scarce time and\nmoney unless they will get a good return from it. Similarly, we recognise\nas a society that intellectual property\nmust exist in the pharmaceutical industry even though more people will\nhave access to existing drugs if we\nscrapped them. We recognise that no\nindividual or company would bear the\ncosts of designing a new drug if every\nother company would profit from it\nwith no work and they would make a\nloss from it.\nEdward tackled this argument of intellectual property rights promoting\ninnovation and investment by claiming\nthat they can also restrict innovation.\nThis is a weak argument in my opinion\n\u2013 it requires further analysis weighing\nup how intellectual property rights restrict innovation more than they promote it. Of course, there are examples\nof where intellectual property have restricted innovation \u2013technology firms\noften register patents to prevent other\ncompanies from being able to implement those ideas (the most ridiculous\nexample that comes to mind is Amazon\u2019s 1-Click ordering patent).\nI certainly think that we do need\nto look at how we assess patents and\nwhen we award them, but this is an argument for patent reform; it is difficult\nto then make the leap to the abolishment of intellectual property rights in\nall cases.\nThere are plenty of examples where\nintellectual property rights don\u2019t restrict innovation. For example, no\nfiction writer would ever complain\nthat Disney\u2019s intellectual property on\n\u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d harms their ability to write a new work of fiction. No\noriginal songwriter would complain\nthat Pink Floyd\u2019s intellectual property\nof their songs harms their own ability\nto write new songs. Similarly, the fact\nthat I can\u2019t just rip off the stories from\nHeroes to create my own television\ndrama series doesn\u2019t restrict innovation \u2013 if anything, it forces me to innovate by coming up with new stories.\nAs far as I can see, the only effect of\nabolishing intellectual property rights\nwould be to encourage the plagiarism\nand profiting from other people\u2019s material \u2013 something which doesn\u2019t benefit society at all.\nFinally, I want to explore the effects\nof intellectual property on freedom\nof speech and thought. We recognise\nfreedom of speech to be important in\nsociety because it is necessary for a\nmarketplace of ideas to exist and work.\nAs citizens of a democratic country,\nwe all participate in the marketplace\nof ideas: sharing our ideas, discussing our thoughts and making sugges-tions. A strong marketplace of ideas is\nimportant as it allows society to weigh\nup new ideas based on their merits and\narguments.\nThis allows the very best ideas to\npropagate and then to become social\nnorms and beliefs. How do intellectual\nproperty rights limit my freedom of\nspeech? The fact that Amazon holds\nintellectual property and patents on\none-click ordering or that Disney own\nthe intellectual property to \u201cWinnie\nthe Pooh\u201d doesn\u2019t stop me from mentioning or discussing those ideas with\nother people. It does not restrict my\nability to seek, receive or impart these\nideas. But it does make the marketplace of ideas work better: firstly by\nintellectual property rights facilitating the development of new ideas and\nsecondly preventing old ideas from being needlessly copied, plagiarised and\nduplicated \u2013 something which would\nonly add to the noise in the market-place. As much as the typical Imperial\nstudent hates referencing their lab re-ports, it is difficult to make the argument that copying ideas as opposed to\nreferencing and recognising the original researchers would be beneficial for\nsociety.\nIn conclusion, I have demonstrated\nthat property rights exist not just to\nallocate scarce resources but primarily\nand more importantly to encourage\ninvestment and development of those\nresources.\nI have demonstrated how intellectual\nproperty rights encourage innovation\nin the movie industry and pharmaceutical industry \u2013 why it is necessary for\nus to have those intellectual property\nrights if we are to have the intellectual\nproperty at all. Finally, I looked at the\nreasons for free speech existing in our\nsociety and how intellectual property\ncan contribute towards it.\nOn balance, I strongly feel that the\ncase for scrapping intellectual property rights is weak at best and that doing so would be immensely harmful for\nsociety.\nA clear argument against IP - Avatar may not have been made without it\nWould anyone have bothered making Heroes if something like freeonlineepisodes.net/heroes existed? I think not...\n\u201c...of course, there\nare examples of\nwhere intellectual\nproperty have\nrestricted\ninnovation\u201d\n\n"

With a combined 86%\nof the market in their pockets, even\nGoogle has had a hard time making a\ndent in the market, despite widespread\npublicity. This state of affairs looks like\nit\u2019s about to change in the near future\nhowever, with Google\u2019s own Chrome\nbrowser picking up more market share\nthan either Firefox or IE for the entirety of 2010. In addition, if Google continues to use the new HTML5 standard\nwith the h.264 video codec in YouTube\nvideos, they could be signing the death\nknell for Firefox, in a cunning manoeuvre that could see them simultaneously\nbringing YouTube into the HTML5 era\nwhile grabbing a chunk of the browser\nmarket share for Chrome.\nHTML5 is the next evolution of the\nHTML language that brings a whole\nnew set of functionality to webpages.\nOne of the most noticeable features of\nHTML5 is the ability to embed streaming video without having to install any\nsort of plugin like Adobe\u2019s Flash, the\ncurrent favourite video distribution\nplatform, or Microsoft\u2019s Silverlight.\nWhat this should mean is that your\naverage user doesn\u2019t have to worry\nabout the hassle of installing and updating plugins on a regular basis just\nto watch a few clips; removing another\nsource of browser vulnerabilities and\ncrashes. YouTube already supports\nthe new HTML5 tag, and users can\nwatch HTML5 video by signing up for\nthe HTML5 Beta testing group. Yet\nFirefox, Opera and IE users without\nGoogle\u2019s Chrome Frame need not ap-ply. Neither Microsoft or Mozilla have\nbothered implementing the h.264 co-dec, despite the fact that it would be a\nmajor step forward for browser tech-nologies. With Microsoft, the issue\nseems quite simple, they are probably\nwaiting to see how the codec/platform\nwars will play out before they make a\ndecision on implementing any one,\nespecially as they are promoting their\nown platform, Silverlight. With Firefox however, the issue is much deeper,\ninvolving questions about the very\nnature of free software design and the\nethos behind the Mozilla Foundation.\nThe h.264 codec is a proprietary\nvideo codec which therefore means\nany company that wants to include\nit has to pay a hefty licensing fee before they can build compatibility into\ntheir software. Opera software, the\nmanufacturers behind the Opera family of browsers, has refused to pay the\nlicensing fee outright, citing the high\ncost of the license. The concern that\nthe Firefox developers have, however,\nis quite different. In a blog post, one\nMozilla developer stated that licensing H.264 \u201cwould violate the principles of free software that we strongly\nbelieve in\u201d. He also went on to say that\n\u201cwe have leverage to possibly change\nthe codec situation\u201d in relation to why\nthey don\u2019t use the h.264 codec on the\nuser\u2019s system and instead support the\nopen source Ogg Theora video codec.\nThis is essentially Mozilla hinting that\nit expects their refusal to implement\nthe proprietary codec to send a strong\nmessage prompting developers to rethink the platforms that they use to\ndistribute media.\nI\u2019m very sceptical about the validity\nof this argument. While Mozilla taking\nthe moral high ground is admirable,\ninternet users are faced with a plethora\nof choices when it comes to browsers,\nmost notably the WebKit based brows-ers, Chrome from Google and Apple\u2019s\nSafari. Both Google and Apple, who\nuses h.264 extensively in its QuickTime video format, have handed over\nthe licensing fee, making them two of\nthe very few companies that can offer a\nbrowser with full h.264 video capabilities right out of the box.\nAs more and more users and websites switch to the HTML5 tagging\nsystem for embedded video, and likely\nfollow the lead of YouTube with h.264,\nthose with Firefox will simply download other browsers, without even\nconcerning themselves with the ethical\nissues behind Mozilla\u2019s refusal to pay\nthe licensing fee. The end result will\nprobably be a choice of two outcomes;\nthe first being that Mozilla leaves their\nmoral high ground and finds a way\nto license the proprietary codec, or\nthat Mozilla is driven to obscurity in\na matter of a few years. As someone\nwho believes strongly in open source,\nI wish it could be any other way \u2013 but\ngiven a choice between driving Firefox\nto oblivion and licensing the codec, I\nwould pick realism over idealism and\nlicense it.\nY\nou could be forgiven for\nthinking that the tech world\nrevolved around Apple and\nGoogle recently. If it\u2019s not\nthe iPad, the Nexus One or the Google\nChina spat, it\u2019s that Schmidt and Jobs\nare falling out of love.\nThis week Google dropped its newest baby, Buzz, for all the world to see,\nattempting to muscle in on all this social stuff the cool kids seem to be into\nthese days. Not another Wave I hear\nyou say. We haven\u2019t found a use for\neven that yet! Hold faith dear readers;\none day Wave will make perfect sense,\njust ask the Tech team here at felix\ntowers.\nIn a nut-shell, Google Buzz is another social networking environment\nwhere you can share stuff with your\nfriends. But Buzz is a little more than\nthat. Those familiar with FriendFeed\nand other social networking aggrega-tors, might find that they\u2019ve seen most\nof it before. Buzz automatically pulls\nstatus updates and other things from\nplaces like Twitter, Blogger and flickr\nshoving them right into your Googlesphere experience. Buzz works directly\nin Gmail allowing you to share stuff\nwith your private and public Gmail\ncontacts, linking public postings in\nwith your Google Profile page for all\nthe world to see. If you happen not to\nhave a Google Profile, Buzz will automatically create you one, leading to yet\nanother way to find you through your\nfavourite search engine.\nGoogle\u2019s big on algorithms, its\nPageRank system is one of the most\ncomplex currently used on the web\ntoday. Buzz doesn\u2019t escape this passion either, featuring a recommendation engine that puts \u2018Buzz\u2019 from people you don\u2019t follow that it thinks you\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week, another Apple\nstory; this time it might even\ninterest students. Several textbook publishers have signed\non to distribute their wares\nvia a company called ScrollMotion, who are the folks behind the Iceburg Reader on\nthe iPhone. The deal includes\nMcGraw-Hill, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt K-12, Pearson\nEducation and Kaplan Inc and\nothers are said to be in talks.\nCould this see the iPad becoming the one student-friendly\ndevice to rule them all? Unless\nyou\u2019re likely to pay through the\nnose for electronic forms of\nthese textbooks, I doubt it. But\nyou have to admit textbooks\non a device like the iPad is an\nattractive thought. Let\u2019s just\nhope they get the text search\ndone right so you don\u2019t have to\nsift through pages upon pages\nof irrelevant rubbish to find\nthat golden paragraph you\u2019ve\nbeen looking for.\nThe iPad alterna-tive, the JooJoo was\nalso in\nthe news\nthis week\nwith the announcement\nthat it too\nhas an App Store\n(doesn\u2019t every- one these\ndays?) - a webapp store. Fusion\nGarage argue, quite rightly so,\nthat the iPad has a large advantage provided by the categorised and searchable App\nStore. They plan on making a\nwebbapp based store in a similar fashion. Let\u2019s just hope they\nmake a better stab at\nwebapps than Apple did when it\nsaid webapps\nare \u2018the only\napps you\nneed\u2019. Ha,\nyeah right.\nMore sexts got\ninto the news this week\ntoo. For those not familiar\nwith the term; a sext is a sexy\ntext often in the news because\nof minors sending nude picture\nmessages to each other. Idiots.\nAnyway, one poor bloke from\nWinnipeg, Canada got caught\nwith some luscious sexts on his\nphone by his girlfriend, seemingly from another woman.\nProblem is Darren P, as he was\nnamed by local press, didn\u2019t\nknow where they\u2019d come from.\nTurns out that the pranksters\nfrom Virgin Mobile pre-loaded\nDarren\u2019s new Samsung phone\nwith some pretty innocent\ntexts with things like \u2018Booty\nCall\u2019, \u2018Where you at\u2019 and \u2018Be\nthere soon\u2019. Now why a phone\nwould come pre-loaded with\ntext messages, God knows,\nbut way to overreact! It wasn\u2019t\nuntil Darren went to the shop\nand they found the texts on all\nthe phones of the same model\nthat Darren was proclaimed\ninnocent. Not sure whether\nthey reconciled their differences but if I were Darren I\u2019d\nthink twice before taking little-miss crazy back. After all, who\nin their right mind uses the\nphrase Booty Call?\nGood news for\nthose of you who\nare Freeview\nusers, as the\nservice is getting two new\nchannels.

I also suspect that\nthis daydream isn\u2019t confined to the\nglamour-deprived students of Imperial. This is the demographic that companies like Guava Talent Management\ntarget, promising their victims the opportunity to work as an extra in TV\nand film and also do a spot of modelling whilst making some money along\nthe way.\nUnfortunately for the people who\nsign up to \u2018modelling agencies\u2019 like\nGuava Talent Management, the reality\nis that the company is more interested\nin taking your money than turning\nyou into a successful model. The scam\nis fairly simple: the company\u2019s \u201ctalent\nscouts\u201d approach you on the street\n(some students have been accosted\nnear campus on High Street Kensington) and tell you that they\u2019re looking\nfor potential models. They take your\ndetails and also a photo; no mention\nof costs is made. A couple of weeks\nlater they call you up and invite you\nto The Light Rooms in Soho (a studio\nthat they own) so that they can make\na portfolio for you. Then, after you\u2019ve\npaid for your portfolio, the mountain\nof modelling and acting work suddenly\ndisappears.\nThe company has a very profession-al-looking website to lend the whole\noperation an air of credibility. It claims\nto be \u201cthe UK\u2019s premier online talent\ndirectory\u201d and there are stylish photos\nof models with unattributed testimonials about the company like \u201cEven with\nlast minute castings we get good quality talent and great service\u201d. They even\npromise you your own \u201cpersonal cast-Kadhim Shubber and Rebecca Holyer investigate the \u201ctalent scouts\u201d on High Street Kensington\nThe scam\nThe scam targets vulnerable\nyoung females, promising anything from casual extras work\nto a glamorous professional\nmodelling career. After sucking them in with a believable\nperformance on the street, the\ngirls are called up 2/3 weeks\nlater and told that they have\nthe perfect \u2018look\u2019. They are\nthen sweet-talked into a photo\nshoot and lead to believe that it\nonly costs \u00a3100 for copyright\nfees with the rest paid by the\ncompany. Come the day of the\nshoot, the costs quickly spiral\nand some of the more trusting\nvictims have ended up spending over \u00a31000 on a professional photographic portfolio\nfor booking agents who didn\u2019t\neven exist. The photo shoots\ntake place at one location, The\nLight Rooms, which is owned\nby the same person who owns\nthe \u2018modelling agency\u2019.\nMy run-in with\nGuava\nI\nam one of the many unaware students to have been\npropositioned by, and agreed\nto, naively in hindsight, this\nseemingly good opportunity. I\nwas stopped on High Street Kensington and told that I could do\nmodelling and extra work, and I\nsigned up. After talking you into\nwhat seems a flattering and genuine offer, these perfectly profes-sional-sounding scouts take your\nname and phone number as well\nas photograph you to see if you\nare right for any parts booking\nagencies are currently recruiting\nfor.\nAfter signing up I returned to\nImperial and did some Internet\nresearch on the company using\nthe information on their business\ncard. This was when I discovered\nthat this \u201choax\u201d talent agency is\nactually operating a nationwide\nscam. There\u2019s so much information on the Internet about it, so\nmuch that when you Google the\ncompany, their website is way\ndown the results, after countless\nblogs warning about the scam. It\u2019s\nactually surprising that they actually manage to con people.\nAfter reading this I obviously\nrushed straight back to High\nStreet to demand that my information be deleted so I could not\nbe contacted. But seeing so many\nnames and numbers written in\nher pad (literally hundreds), I realised that many of these would\nprobably be other oblivious Imperial students. So, to whom this\nconcerns, it still remains that if an\nopportunity sounds too good to\nbe true, then it probably is and is\nnot worth the risk.\ning booker.\u201d In addition, the company\nlists a a selection of their \u2018associates\u2019,\nname dropping Channel 4 and Guess\nJeans, when in reality neither of these\ncompanies have done any work with\nGuava Talent Management.\nThe company isn\u2019t part of the Association of Modelling Agents which says\nthat an agents\u2019 income should be derived solely from commision on work\nobtained for their models.\nStudents should be wary of \u2018agents\u2019\nthat approach them on the street. Very\nfew succesful models were randomly discovered on the street and if in\ndoubt, there\u2019s a wealth of information\non the Internet. A simple rule is that\nif you\u2019re being asked to pay for something upfront without any guarantee of\nwork in return, then alarm bells should\nbe ringing.\nIn the meantime, maybe it\u2019s time to-stop day-dreaming about the glamorous world of modelling and start concentrating in lectures; exams are only a\nfew months away.\nZebra\nCollections\n& Vanity\nManagement\nG\nuava Talent Management\nis just the newest incarnation of a series of \u2018modelling agencies\u2019 that have\nbeen abandoned when they\u2019ve been\nuncovered. All are owned by the same\nman, Chris Garner, and have been investigated by the BBC\u2019s Inside Out.\nThey showed that many young girls\nhad spent hundreds of pounds on\nphoto shoots at The Light Rooms for\npotential jobs that never materialised;\nthe only difference to the Guava Talent\nManagement scam was the name of\nthe company; Zebra Collections.\nDespite government regulations\nto try and prevent agencies charging\nupfront fees, the practice still contin-ues. And despite the large number of\nwoman who have been scammed, the\ncompany describe themselves as \u201ca\nfreelance talent agency\u201d which operates\nas a recruitment firm, not as an employ-er, so therefore never guarantees their\nmembers any work. So in a legal sense\nneither Chris Garner nor any of his staff\nare doing anything that can be proven\nto be breaking the law. Or the wrong agency for all people rth the risk.\n\n"

As a result I was censored. Personally\nI believe a few well placed expletives\nhave the ability to get your point across\n1) much faster and 2) much clearer.\nFor example, the phrase \u2018fuck off\u2019\ndoes not mean \u2018go away\u2019. Neither\ndoes it mean \u2018please leave me alone.\u2019\nIt means \u2018get out of my sight, you are\nreally beginning to annoy me and I\u2019m\nabout to get angry.\u2019 Now would you\never say that? Err no. So \u2018fuck off\u2019 it is.\nNow that got me to thinking about\nsome of the common expletives we use\nin day to day life. What do they really\nmean? One of my personal favourites\nis \u2018bugger off\u2019. This literally means,\n\u2018go have anal sex with another man.\u2019\nWhere does that come from? Similarly\nthe word \u2018cretin\u2019, is an often used word\nto describe someone who is being a\nbit of an idiot (or moron). Now cretin originally derives from the French\nword cr\u00e9tin. This actually originates\nfrom the French dialectal word for a\ndeformed and mentally retarded person found in certain Alpine valleys.\nNot even the whole of shitting France!\nThat moves me onto \u2018shit\u2019, a.k.a poo.\n\u2018Shit\u2019 is thought to have derived from\ntwo places: the old English verb \u2018scitan\u2019 which means to split or devide.\nLater, circa 1585 the noun \u2018scitte\u2019 arose\nwhich defined purging or excrement.\n\u2018Shit\u2019 was not considered to be taboo\nuntil after 1600, and rarely appeared\nin print- not even in all Shakespeare\u2019s\nwritings. It still caused anger as late\nas 1922 (in Ulysses) and was omitted\nfrom some dictionaries as recently as\n1970 in the Webster\u2019s New World.\nFrom this word, numerous derivi-taves arose- the past participle \u2018shat\u2019\nand the comical \u2018shite\u2019. But it\u2019s biggest\nclaim to fame is the phrase \u2018the shit\nhas hit the fan.\u2019 This was described by\nHugh Rawson in 1989: \u201cThe expression derives from an old joke. A man\nin a crowded bar needed to defecate\nbut couldn\u2019t find a bathroom, so he\nwent upstairs and used a hole in the\nfloor. Returning, he found everyone\nhad gone except the bartender, who\nwas cowering behind the bar. When\nthe man asked what had happened, the\nbartender replied: \u2018Where were you\nwhen the shit hit the fan?\u2019 \u201d.\nmmmmmm.....\nWordpath 1,453\nHow to play:\nMake a path from the origin word to the destination\nword by taking steps between words using one of the\nthree following methods:\nLetter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.\ne.g. WORD -> WARD\nAnagram: Rearrange the letters.\ne.g. WARD -> DRAW\nWordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter\nword from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.\ne.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)\nNo consecutive steps may be made by the same method.\ne.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would\nbe invalid.\nPoints are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path\nbetween the two words.

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 12 FEBRUARY 2010\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk SCIENCE\nL\ninks between businesses\nand universities have existed in one form or another\nat least since the start of the\nindustrial revolution, but\nover the past 30 years there has been a\ngradual and significant change in that\nrelationship, a process that has been\ncalled by many the \u2018commercialisation\u2019\nof universities.\nFrom early in the 20th century, the\nofficial, and to a large degree operative,\npolicy of government towards university funding of general research (i.e.\nfunding not associated directly with a\ngovernment department like the Ministry of Defence), had been an adherence to the \u2018Haldane Principle\u2019. This\nguaranteed autonomy for Research\nCouncils so that science would be\nfree of political (and other) pressures,\nwhich might discourage research in\ncertain areas. This policy allowed a\ncertain space for faculties and faculty\nmembers to pursue research on the\nbasis of their own instincts and inter-ests. Furthermore, during this period\nuniversities received close to 100% of\nits funding from government, either\ndirectly through government departments or through these autonomous\nResearch Councils.\nThe first phase of the \u2018commercialisation\u2019 of universities began in the 1970s\nwhen, due to increasing international\neconomic competition, industrialised\ncountries were losing their monopoly\nover the world\u2019s heavy industry. Government and corporate managers realised that their economic dominance in\nthe future could only be sustained by\na move towards more capital-intensive\nhigh-technology industries (e.g. space,\nelectronics, telecommunication, bio-engineering), for which universities\nwere the source.\nThe campus became a major source\nof the intellectual capital that would\nbe required for this economic strategy and profit-seeking activity. It was\nin this context that new Patent legislation was passed in every industrialised\ncountry, the two major ones in the UK\nbeing the Patents Act (1977) and the\nCopyright, Designs and Patents Act\n(1988).\nThis legislation made it clear that\nall forms of intellectual capital generated by an employee (in a university\nor a business), would belong to the\nemployer \u2013 even if that research that\nwas funded with public money. This is\nsignificant because, for the first time in\nthe eyes of the law, universities became\nproducers and owners of property\nwhich could be traded with the private\nsector \u2013 like any other business. And\nlike any other business they became\nsubject to commercial pressure. A\nneed to produce commercially-viable\nproducts (research) became the primary concern of university manage-ment. Corporate ties were cultivated\nand private sector funding for research\nduced a new requirement that researchers seeking grants must now\ndescribe the economic impact of the\nwork that are intending to do. This is\nclearly at odds with the principle that\nresearchers themselves should set the\nagenda for research, not state or corporate managers \u2013 the basis for the\nHaldane principle.\nWe must conclude that universities\nare being turned more and more into\ncorporate research centres, in order to\ncreate the seeds for new profits based\non high-tech industry. The government is using them to push national\neconomic growth in a direction which\nplays to the UK\u2019s perceived economic \u2018competitive advantage\u2019 \u2013 that is,\ncapital-intensive, knowledge-based\nindustry.\nAre these positive trends? Do they\nimpact on the quality of research? Do\nthey serve the greater good of soci-ety? We know what the government\u2019s\nresponse to these questions would\nbe. And big business loves it. Objective analysis can only come from\nsources outside the state-corporate\ncircles who are benefiting from these\ntendencies.\nA recent analysis has been published by the independent non-profit\ngroup \u2018Scientists for Global Responsibility\u2019 (SGR), an organisation supported by many prominent scien-tists, including physicists Steven\nHawkins and Lord Rees. The report\nruns through case studies in various\nresearch sectors \u2013 pharmaceuticals,\nmilitary/defence, oil and gas, and\nbiotechnology \u2013 and concludes that\nthere have indeed been detrimental\neffects caused by commercial influ-ence. Among the problems identified\nare:\nThe commercialisation of science\nThe SGR report also comments that universities are \u201cbeing\ninternally reorganised so that they behave more like businesses\u201d. This observation doesn\u2019t only have significance for\nthe research function of a university, but also for the educational function. Technology historian David Noble points\nout that a characteristic of the past thirty years has been\n\u201cthe wholesale reallocation of university resources towards\nits research function at the expense of its educational func-tion. Class sizes swelled, teaching staff and instructional\nresources were reduced, salaries were frozen. At the same\ntime, tuition soared \u2026. In the end, students were paying\nmore for their education and getting less...\u201d. Of course, this\nisallinlinewithwhatagoodbusinessshoulddo\u2013maximise\nincome and cut back on expenses. The expense happens to\nbe quality of tuition, but who cares about that?\nThe commercialisation of the research function of universities is being followed by a new and emerging com-mercialisation of the educational function. Traditionally,\njust like in the case of a faculty member\u2019s research output,\nthe faculty member\u2019s teaching output (e.g. course notes,\nproblemsetsetc.)usedtobetheintellectualpropertyofthe\nindividual(s) who produced the work. Today, the copyright\nfor a faculty member\u2019s teaching material belongs to the college under a \u201croyalty-free\u201d licence, although Imperial College\u2019s policy document on IP states that \u201cImperial College\ngenerallywaivesitsclaimtocopyrightinteachingmaterials,\ntextbooks and research publications\u201d.\nThis is the state of affairs at the moment. However, there\nis a growing trend among universities in the US towards the\nuse of computers and information technology to automate\nand sell education services and \u2018courseware\u2019. This trend is\nbeing driven by university managers who see the selling of\nuniversity courses and instructional material via the medium of computers as both another way to make money, and\na way to cut costs on teaching staff. Its advocates claim that\nthis is the way to administer good education efficiently in\nthe 21st century in a way which benefits students as well as\nthe university.\nA transition to such a system of university education will\nrequire faculties to completely relinquish their right to their\nteaching material to the universities. These resources will be\nused as \u2018courseware\u2019 in an automated process of education\nwhich ultimately undermines their own roles as educators. All\nof this is going ahead, despite protests by many students and\nfaculty staff, who see this development as one which reduces\nthe quality of education provision.\nTheparadigmwhichunderliestheautomationandcommercialisation of education is a view of universities as \u2018producers\u2019\nof education and students as \u2018consumers\u2019 of education. This\nview of education is antagonistic to everything that is known\nabout \u2018best practice\u2019 in teaching and learning in general. The\nbroadconsensusamongeducationprofessionalsateverylevel\nis that a good education involves students actively participat-ingintheirlearningprocess,withscopeforpursuingpointsof\ninterest \u2013 not passively consuming prepackaged \u2018courseware\u2019.\nConsequently, moves towards commodification of university\ncourses is bound to have a detrimental effect on the quality\nof education if it is used in place of traditional methods. Despite this, the number of advocates of the pretence that the\n\u2018producer/consumer\u2019 paradigm is consistent with pedagogy\ncontinuetogrowamonguniversitymanagers.Prestigiousuni-versities may be able to resist this trend (if they decide to \u2013 an\nuncertain\u2018if\u2019),butthescarcertheresourcesofauniversity,the\nmore alluring this option becomes to its managers.\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) has taken up this\nissue and have expressed support for the idea that students\nshould be viewed and treated as \u2018co-producers\u2019, rather than\n\u2018consumers\u2019. The voice of Imperial College students would be\nweak on this issue, if it existed at all, due to our union\u2019s decision to pull out of the NUS.\nWhetheryoulikeordislikethedevelopmentsinhighereducationoverthepastfewdecades,thereisachoicetobemade.\nCurrent institutional arrangements ensure that students and\nfaculties have little or no say in these issues of great signifi-cance.Willwestandby,voiceless,whileotherforces(whether\nmalevolent or not) shape our institutions and our society in\ntheirinterests?Orwillwejoinwithotherstudents,willfaculty\nmembers join with other faculties, to ensure that our voices\nareatleastafactor(butpreferablytheleadingforce)indeter-mining the future of our universities?\nThe classroom vs the boardroom\nPhilip Avraam traces how historical success of universities in research has paved the way for their own demise\n...producing a\ncommercially viable\nproduct is likely to\nstifle the best kind\nof research\nat universities grew, with obvious potential consequences for the erosion\nof the values which lie behind the Haldane principle, discussed later.\nPerhaps these developments are nothing to worry about so long as government funded, autonomous Research\nCouncils still exist. However, the autonomy of these Research Councils is also\nbeing attacked by their paymasters. In\ncontemporary political rhetoric, science\nis always mentioned in the same breath\nas the economy. The newly formed Department for Business, Innovation and\nSkills places business and university research under the same high level administrative umbrella.\nThis phenomenon is further exemplified by the 2007 Sainsbury Review on\n\u2018Science and Innovation Policies\u2019\n, the\nsuggestions of which the government\nsays it will implement in full. This document is dotted with recommendations\nlike (Recommendation 2.4) \u201cThe Technology Strategy Board should work with\nthe Research Councils to identify the\ncomplex, high-value-added production\ntechnologies that current and emerging\nindustries require and which are likely to\nflourish in high-cost economies\u201d\n.\nLast year, research councils intro-(1) In regards to funding, commer-cialisation has led to the \u201cintroduction\nof significant bias and marginalisation\nof work with clear social and environmental benefits\u201d;\n(2) \u201cDirect commercial funding of a\nresearch study increases the likelihood\nthat the results will be favourable to\nthe funders\u201d;\n(3) \u201cOpenness in research can be\ncompromised through the use of commercial confidentiality agreements (in-cluding patents) and other...\u201d;\n(4) Orientation of faculties and departments to \u201ccommercial needs rather\nthan to broader public interest of curi-osity-driven goals.\u201d;\n(5) Decisions about controversial\ntechnologies are taken with very little\npublic consultation.\nAnd what about blue-skies re-search? Having to justify one\u2019s research on the basis of the likelihood\nof producing a commercially viable\nproduct is likely to stifle the best\nkind of research \u2013 that which enters\nnew and unknown domains. Einstein\nonce said about research that, \u201cIf we\nknew what we were doing, it wouldn\u2019t\nbe called research\u201d.\nImperial College: University or corporate research centre?\nScientists for Global Responsibility:\ncorporate influence is damaging\nresearch\n\n"

So\nkeep reading. Please keep reading.\nThe story is this: there is a brilliant\nartist who has thrown it in to dedicate\nhis life to alchemy, and is fast going\ncrazy as he downs litres of absinthe,\ncan\u2019t sleep or eat and desperately attempts to get his wife to come back.\nBut somehow it does manage to cling\nto reality, probably due to the excellent\nscript and acting by the very unique\ncharacters (including an amusingly\nwelsh landlady).\nIn some unbelievable way, it all\nseems very real; so much so that I\ndidn\u2019t get much sense of actually being\n\u2018inside the mind\u2019 of the alchemist with\nthe unravelling life. His nightmares\nwere manifested in his occasional\nbreakdowns and obvious paranoia,\nbut I liked the fact that we didn\u2019t have\nto share his fanatical paranoia, it was\nrather with his wife and doctor that we\ncould empathise, at least to begin with.\nThe really cool thing about the venue\nfor this play is that it is a \u2018theatre-pub\u2019\n, if\nyou haven\u2019t been to one, it is absolutely\nworth it. The room is small and the\nfront row (out of three, running along\ntwo walls of the room) sits on the set.\nThis means you are ridiculously close to\nthe actors; intense doesn\u2019t come close\nto describing how powerful the atmosphere is.\nThere are some stunningly personal\nscenes and the environment created by\nthe sound of weather outside feels real-istic; you can even smell the food, perfume and musk.\nThe set, being so tiny and hemmed\nby the audience on two out of four\nsides, is one room which cleverly\nmorphs every \u2018scene\u2019, into the room of\neach of the respective characters. This\nall seems quite normal if a bit dream-like, but is quite easy to follow which\nreally speeds up the pace, and doesn\u2019t\nleave the set feeling constricted as \u2018one\nset\u2019 plays can be.\nComplaints might be that there are\na lot of stressful shouty scenes when\npeople are angry and crazy (at least it\u2019s\nexciting) and at points it\u2019s difficult to\nsee how the play is moving forwards.\nSometimes the unravelling in the second act feels a bit gratuitous, but it\nis also genuinely captivating and you\nhave just over one week left to see it.\nReview by Rox Middleton\nMaria Dalberg as Harriet and Tom Cornish as the crazy Edgar Lutzen.

I\u2019ll probably not\nlisten to this song again after finishing\nthis review - Kadhim Shubber\nNEW BOYZ\nSKINNY JEANZ\nAND A MIC\nWARNER BROS.\nALBUM\nUnlike most rappers, these two cute little kids like their jeans skinny. They\u2019re\nlike a less goofy Keenan & Kel rapping\nfresh funny lyrics over stripped down\nminimal beats. Though they clearly\nborrow heavily from the Neptunes,\nthis sounds pretty new and cool.\n- Alexandra Ashford\nARCHIE\nBRONSON\nOUTFIT\nSHARK\u2019S TOOTH\nDOMINO\nSINGLE\nand I\u2019m having my expectations raised\nby the album until a totally superfluous guitar solo begins to masturbate\nthe song to death. Unfortunately this\nis not an isolated occurrence. It seems\nevery time, just as I find something\nthat makes me more interested in a\nsong, some musical wankery appears\nslap-bang in the middle that makes me\nswitch off. The album comes across as\nit\u2019s trying to be anthemic pop, which\nit comes some way to succeeding, but\nit is missing a song with a killer hook\nor catchy line.\n- Christopher Walmsley\nHED KANDI\nWORLD SERIES:\nTOKYO\nHED KANDI\nCOMPILATION\nThis compilation has lots of the big\ndancefloor bangers you will have\nheard on your last lads on tour/girls\nnight out on the lash, mixed in with\nlots of cheesy, cheesy house. Despite\nbeing to club music what Hersheys is\nto chocolate, lots of people will like\nthis.- Alexandra Ashford\nWhether you like Owl CIty will depend on how loosely you define plagia-rism. It simply feels like Give Up has\nbeen put though a blender with the addition of boy band backing music. And\nlet\u2019s not forget the must have vocal accessory of the moment, autotuning. -Christopher Walmsley\nGOLDHAWKS\nWHERE IN THE\nWORLD\nMERCURY\nSINGLE\nI was hoping this band might be inspired to recreate the joys of Sheppy B\u2019s\nGoldhawk road in musical glory. The\nAfrican fabric shops, the falafel stalls,\nthe weed dealers and fake rhinestoned\nNikes. No, they are actually trying to\nrecreate the sound of Bon Jovi, diluted\nand tuneless. - Alexandra Ashford\nOWL CITY\nOCEAN EYES\nREPUBLIC\nALBUM\nMost listened to this week by\nFelix Music members on last.fm\n1.

You spend\nages pondering over\nthe final solution\ntour destination. For\nit would be a tour for one of those racial fellas.\nYou decied that you\u2019d take her to a quintessential\nEnglish transport caf. You explain that the shouts\nat her are not racially motivated. You have to lie.\nYou\u2019ll always have to lie.\nVirgo\nIt was going quite\nwell by the time felix\nreached Virgo. You\nwoo her: I\u2019d give up\nforever to touch you,\n\u2018cause I know that you\nfeel me somehow, you\u2019re the closest to heaven\nthat I\u2019ll ever be, and I don\u2019t want to go home\nright now. And all I can taste is this moment, and\nall I can breathe is your life. \u2018cause sooner or later\nit\u2019s over, I just don\u2019t want to miss you tonight.\nGemini\nSo she says that she\njust needs to get\nready. She puts on her\nmake-up and brushes\nher long blonde hair.\nAnd then she asks,\n\u201cDo I look all right?\u201d And I say, \u201cYes, you look\nwonderful tonight.\u201d It\u2019s reassuring to know that\nshe is a typical fucking woman who takes ages\nto get ready. Men on the other hand, if we\u2019re not\nnaked then it\u2019s pretty much job done.\nPisces\nHowever you started\nthinking that maybe\nyour face is beautiful\nand you log on to\nwww.nicethaibrides.\ncom and set yourself\nup date. You just don\u2019t want to be alone this\nValentine\u2019s Day. Not after last year when you\nwound up in Accident and Emergency with\na garden gnome up your arse. That took a\nconsiderable amount of explanation.\nLeo\nTwo lads lurch\ntowards you throwing\nsausages. Maybe\nit\u2019s some sort of gay\ninvitation. Maybe it\nisn\u2019t. To look hard you\nask of them, \u201ccome on then... if you think you\u2019re\nhard enough.\u201d That sounded very gay so they call\nyou a massive poofter and fuck off. You tell her\nthat you would stab them in the japs eye with the\nketchup bottle and they ran off scared. You lied.\nAries\nSo she arrives, and\nshe\u2019s a fucking stunner.\nLike a serious knob\nexploding stunner. You\nnever knew that mail-order brides can look\nso fan-fucking-tastic. You check her over to see if\nshe has been shop-soiled or damaged in transit.\nShe hasn\u2019t. Jurassic Park! You make idle chitter\nchat, comment on her eyes and her short stature.\nShe says that she likes your dog. You get worried.\nScorpio\nYou join the BNP\nand put an advert on\ntheir web site. It reads\n\u201cRacists of this world.\nThis world should be\nour world. Our world\nvoid of all black, brown, and yellow (or any other\nderivative) people. If you believe me, join my quest\nto invade Thailand and get back at the makers of\nwww.nicethaibrides.com.\u201d Lets be honest, you are a\nfucking useless cunt.\nLibra\nShe asks for a\ntranslation and she\u2019s\nvery much less than\nimpressed. Maybe they\ndon\u2019t have the same\nlaws in Thailand. She\nhits you with a pint glass. Rather uncalled for if\nyou ask me. You are not happy, and decide that\na full on invasion of Thailand is the only way to\nget over it. That night you dream about Nazi\nGermany. If only SW7 was more like that.\nTaurus\nFuck it. She might\nwant to eat your\ndog, but it\u2019s only a\nmongrel. You can\nalways get another.\nBattersea have a\nwhole shitting shed full of them. You can always\nget a new one there, besides, you\u2019ll probably\nbe helping the overcrowding problem there.\nSeriously it\u2019s like Mecca when they\u2019re doing their\nHajj. Or whatever they call it.\nCapricorn\nYou were released-although walking like a\npenguin. Life is treating\nyou badly. You\u2019ve\nmessed up your whole\nlife and want it to be like\nit was before. When you were loved, not fisted. But\nthat can\u2019t be done. You crawl into a hole and hope\nyou\u2019ll never be found. However, some American\ntroops find you and call you Saddam... it gets\nworse, you have one phone call. It\u2019s engaged. Pint?\nAquarius\nThis week you\u2019ve\nbeen asked to take\nphotos for a casting\nagency. They\u2019ve\napproached you on\nthe street and you\u2019re\nall flustered as they compliment your big face.\nWait, you don\u2019t have a big face. Do you? I don\u2019t\nknow. Maybe you do. Your face IS fairly big,\nI\u2019m not going to lie. Maybe you could get face\nreduction surgery.

The\nevent was a four-way fight between\nuniversities Surrey, Brunel, Royal Holloway and of course Imperial.\nThe Dressage phase got underway\nwith team member Ilse Daly riding a\nlittle horse with rather too much energy for its own good. None the less,\nthe Dressage test (hastily learned from\na copy scrawled on the back of a physics problem sheet) was fairly calm and\ncollected, with only a few additional\nsideways manoeuvres! Mikaela BryantMeisner was allotted the largest horse\nin the competition by far, who was\nalso feeling a tad excitable. However,\nMikaela managed to remain perfectly\ncalm and rode a beautiful test. She\nalso managed to find the brakes, which\nwas more than some of the later riders managed. Katie Lawrence\u2019s horse\nwas none too helpful either; having\nthe opposite problem to the one face\nby Mikaela- this time the hand brake\nwas permanently on. However, after\nan exhausting ride, involving no small\namount of cajoling, Katie produced\nan excellent test well worthy of a true\nDressage geek. Last to go from Imperial was team captain Andre Wilmes,\nand his horse, a rather grumpy fellow,\ndidn\u2019t stand a chance of misbehaving!\nRiding by far and away the best test of\nthe day, his score cinched Imperial\u2019s\ndomination of the Dressage. At the end\nof the first round, IC had a grand total\nof zero penalty points, meaning the IC\nriders were the best riders on each of\ntheir individual horses. Trailing behind\nthem came Royal Holloway with 42,\nthen the host team Surrey with 54 and\nfinally Brunel with 64.\nThe show jumping phase was accompanied by a relentless freezing drizzle,\nbut did nothing to dampen the (in\nsome cases competitive) spirit of the\nIC team. However, the jumping course\nbuilt by the venue certainly caused no\nsmall amount of trepidation amongst\nthe more Dressage-oriented of the\nteam members. Nor did the fairly bad\nbehaviour of the competition horses\nwhen shown the course!\nFirst to go from IC was Andre riding\nan unfortunately clumsy beast. At the\nend of his round, he amassed a number\nof poles on the floor, but luckily the\nhorse was consistently lazy, perhaps\nmore so for the other riders, and Andre\u2019s enviable jumping style held him in\nhigh stead to gain 0 penalty points. The\npony Mikaela rode was, in contrast to\nAndre\u2019s, rather feisty and she whizzed\naround the course in true show jumping tradition, but had an unfortunate\nclip of a pole. Next was the turn of the\nDressage riders. Katie\u2019s horse was both\nimpeccably behaved and ridden to gain\nthe first clear round for IC. Unfortunately, she was just 1 style point behind\na show jumper from Surrey. The last\nrider of the day was Ilse whose horse\nhad worryingly put his rider on the\nfloor while being shown the course. It\nwas with no shortage of nerves that\nshe rode her round. Luckily, the horse\nseemed to have let off enough steam to\nbe surprisingly ridable, which gave IC\na second clear round and the highest\njump style points of the competition.\nSilverware up for grabs\nMustapher Botchway Football\nImperial\u2019s season since the start of term\nhas been much like that of the beginning of the previous term; indifferent.\nWith the prospect of winning three\ntrophies, the BUCS South Eastern 3A\nConference, the ULU Challenge Cup\nand the BUCS South Eastern Knockout Cup, all fixtures from 13 January\non are (well, were) must win games.\nAs previously reported (Issue 1450),\nReading University dashed the chances\nof succeeding LSE 1st XI as BUCS Cup\nvictors.\nNext up was a ULU Challenge Cup\nQuarter-Final against SOAS. Previously unbeaten, this was a tough game\nin which Imperial battled valiantly to\nsecure their first clean sheet of the sea-son, winning 2-0 to set up a Semi-Final\nclash against RUMS (UCL Medicals)\n1st XI.\nAs the hopes of winning the ULU\nPremier Division were over since their\ndisappointing, unexpected loss against\nUCL 3rd XI in the last game of 2009,\ncaptain Mustapher Botchway is using\nthe remaining games to experiment\nwith the team and give some 1st XI experience to some well deserved 2nd XI\nplayers.\nA disappointing 1-all draw against a\nfrankly average St Barts (Queen Mary\nMedicals) further displayed the inconsistency of the team.\nQuality was restored on Wednesday\n3 February when Imperial moved to\njoint top of the BUCS conference after\na comprehensive 4-2 victory against a\nstrong St Mary\u2019s 3rd XI.\nLast weekend brought a ULU League\ntie against RUMS. This, a precursor\nto the semi-final meant that it was all\nto play for with the victors going into\nthe forthcoming tie as favourites. After\ndominating possession for most of the\ngame but not finishing off their chances punished Imperial as they suffered a\n2-1 loss. With both teams raring to win\nsome silverware, the Semi-Final is set\nto be a tense encounter.\nTwo days ago, an away fixture to the\n4th XI of St Mary\u2019s presented an opportunity for Imperial to move three\npoints clear of the BUCS conference.\nSimilar to the RUMS game. a 2-1 loss\nrestored the \u2018topsy turvy\u2019 nature of the\n1st XI\u2019s season.\n\n"

The top-level performance of the\nLadies 1s even won over the sympathy\nof the umpires, who at the end of the\nmatch were very impressed.\nThe Portsmouth match is always a\nchallenging game and brings out the\nbest in the players (even off the pitch\nfor toilet breaks). There was a strong\nstart from both teams last Wednesday;\nhowever Lab Rat made a great break\nthrough up front scoring the first goal.\nThe second goal came from Malvinas\nand the third from a penalty flick taken\nby Token Lezza after a Portsmouth\nplayer stopped the ball heading towards goal with her body (which is illegal if you\u2019re not the goalie).\nThis put the girls in a very solid position at half time. The second half was\nagain tough with Portsmouth managing to score two goals, including one\nfrom a penalty flick; despite this, the\nLadies 1s defensive unit remained\nstrong and put up a great fight, not\nconceding any further. The Portsmouth side were very argumentative\n(a trait duly recognised by the umpires\nand which led to a few green cards)\ncompared to Imperial\u2019s composed and\nconsistent team.

The\nname came from Gary Tanaka, a Japanese-American fund manager who\ndid a PhD in Mathematics at Imperial.\nHe pledged \u00a327 million to the College,\nwho thanked him by naming the new\nBusiness School in his honour. In 2004,\nthe Queen thanked him for his generosity during the ceremony in which\nshe opened the new Business School\nbuilding.\nBut most of the money has yet to\ncome. On Friday, Tanaka was sentenced alongside his business partner\nAlberto Vilar for defrauding investors\nof \u00a313.5 million.

The prosecution\nalleged that the pair had stolen \u00a33.4m\nfrom Lily Cates, a 70-year-old American heiress who had been a client for\n18 years.\nEdward Adams, the private detec-tive, claimed that Vilar and Tanaka had\nused two-thirds of Ms Cates\u2019 fund to\npay off another investor and \u00a3440,000\nof the firm\u2019s bills. Another \u00a3670,000 of\nher money was used by Vilar to fulfil\na charitable pledge to Washington and\nJefferson College, and other personal\nexpenses. The court heard how Tanaka\nhad instructed his assistant, Maxine\nRye, to cut out Ms Cates\u2019 signature\nfrom a document and tape it to a fax\nauthorising the transfer of an extra\n\u00a3170,000 from her brokerage account.\nTanaka was found guilty of three\ncounts of securities fraud, conspiracy\nand investment adviser fraud but innocent of nine other counts. Vilar was\nconvicted of all 12 charges.\nTanaka is the son of Japanese immigrants to America, who were interned\nduring World War Two. He was born\nin a holding camp. After the family\nwere released, his father built a poultry business that enabled Tanaka to afford to attend MIT. When he moved to\nLondon for his PhD, he claimed to have\n\u201cfallen in love with swinging Beatlesera London.\u201d He met Vilar in 1980 after a career that took him around the\nworld, from San Francisco to the Middle East. Together they launched Amerindo Investment Advisors. The firm\ninvested in some of the most successful\nfirms of the dotcom boom, including\nMicrosoft, Cisco, Amazon and eBay.\nAt one point, they had more than \u00a35\nbillion in client assets. But, after the\ndotcom bust, their firm\u2019s stock price\ndropped by 90 per cent.\nThe presiding judge, Richard Sullivan said, \u201cthe investment world needs\nto know this kind of behaviour cannot\nbe tolerated.\u201d The judge is called The\nAvenger for his crusade against allegations of fraud.\nClaiming innocence, Tanaka said,\n\u201cour documentation was lax and that\ngot us into trouble. I\u2019m sorry for what\nhappened ... you think you\u2019re going to\nwin the race and your horse comes\nin last. I was surprised at the severity of the sentence. I feel innocent in\nthe sense that nobody lost money.\nWe were arrested and convicted on a\nfootnote.\u201d He described the trial as \u201ca\nstorm in a teacup.\u201d\nGary Tanaka\ndonated \u00a327\nmillion to\nImperial College\nand was thanked\npersonally by\nthe Queen. He\nnow faces 5\nyears in prison\nfor tfradulent\nA man called Tanaka and his business school\nGary A. Tanaka was born June 23, 1943 to Japanese parents in Hunt,\nIdaho, within the compounds of the Minidoka concentration camp; it\nwas set up to detain Japanese-Americans across the US during World\nWar II.\nHe graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then\nstudied for a PhD in Mathematics at Imperial College. He has two\nsons who have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and are successful\nbusinessmen.\nTanaka has great involvement in thoroughbred racing horses, owning a\nmajor stable that has reared horses that have won races across the globe.\nLiving in London, he donated \u00a327m for the construction of\nImperial\u2019s new business school which was\nsubsequently named after him on opening\nin 2004. The Tanaka Business School was\nrenamed the Imperial College School\nin 2008; it is speculated that this\nname change was in response\nto Tanaka\u2019s charge of\nfraudulent activity.\n\n"

The other half will be watching Love Actually\nin the dark with a tub of Ben & Jerry\u2019s\n\u2013 totally sarcastically, of course. After\nmy last relationship, I\u2019ve regretfully resigned myself to the latter category.\nWe first met in Starbucks. Forsaking\nthe cornucopia of caffeine of the baris-tas, I opted for a healthy bottle of wa-ter. However, the next customer in line\ntook offence at this, being as he was the\nInsanely Wired Coffee Wizard. I trembled in fear as I stared into his crazy,\nbloodshot eyes. Buzzing with rage, he\nthrust me against the sandwich shelf\nand unscrewed the lid of his Thermos\nof Doom. I had disrespected his beverage once; I wouldn\u2019t live to do so again.\nBut amidst the sea of frightened\ncoffee-shop patrons, my saviour arose.\nThe coffee around me was as black\nas night, before a sudden almighty\ncrash! The Coffee Wizard crumpled\nto the floor, crumbs cascading down\nhis greasy locks. Behind him, holding\nthe broken remains of a three-day-old\npanino, stood Breakfast-Spread Girl.\nYes, Breakfast-Spread Girl \u2013 jamming\nup the toaster of evil with her but-terknife of justice! Despite narrowly\navoiding a caffeinated fate, my heart\nbegan to race and I began to sweat. I\nwasn\u2019t high on coffee, I was high on\nlove.\nAfter a manly bout of swooning, I\nwoke up in the firm but graceful arms\nof Breakfast-Spread Girl. Fearing for my\nblood sugar, she immediately offered\nme an emergency dollop of honey. As\nI took it, our hands touched, our eyes\nmet and there were three heaped teaspoons of magic in the air.\nBreakfast-Spread Girl might not be\nthe prettiest superhero \u2013 indeed, she\ncouldn\u2019t hold a candle to the more attractive (albeit rather ineffectual)\nGlamour Woman \u2013 but she had a quiet\nsexiness about her, in a junior librarian kind of way. No, like a butter-laden\ncrumpet, her true beauty lay within.\nShe was smart and funny and had a wit\nyou could cut cheese with. Also, her\nhair smelt like cinnamon. Whenever I\nsaw her, my legs went weaker than cottage cheese on crackers.\nAnd for a time, things were like golden syrup. I was stuck on her and she\nwas so sweet on me. My housemates\nwere naturally jealous, saying how jam-my I was to be dating a superhero \u2013 it\ndrove them nutella!\nBut life is short and these sticky entanglements are all too fleeting. At\nfirst, it was just the small things. I fancied raspberry jam, she favoured straw-berry. Then I wanted to switch to margarine and she would hear none of it. I\nknew we were having problems when\nwe were fighting over which bread was\nsuperlative. Wholemeal was better for\nyou, I argued \u2013 but white tastes nice\ntoasted, she countered. But foolishly I\ndismissed these as the differences that\nendear couples to each other. How\nwrong I was.We were watching a movie\none night, The Breakfast Club I think,\nround her place, bodies close and toast\nat hand. And then, out of the blue, she\nsaid those words that would change our\nrelationship forever.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll have some marmite. Do\nyou want some?\u201d The relationship had\nlanded butter-side down.\nI suppose, on reflection, all that\nsugar wasn\u2019t good for me. Admittedly,\nmy dentist had said so from the start\nbut I think he was just jealous. But\nBreakfast-Spread Girl was so sweet.\nShe spread sunshine across my life, and\nwasn\u2019t sparing with the portions either.\nIt pains me to think that she\u2019s out there\nnow, fighting crime, while I\u2019m here\nalone, buttering my own bread.\nBut she did teach me that love is out\nthere and, like the peach preserve at the\nback of the supermarket shelf, you just\nhave to reach for it...\n...Even if it leaves crumbs on the sheets.\nRhys Davies gets his heart broken, sweetly\n\u201cI knew we were\nhaving problems\nwhen we were\nfighting over\nbread\u201d\n\n"
