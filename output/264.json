If not, you probably won't have reached this far\nanyway.\nAs a fresher you will by now have been given a lot of\nboring good advice by hundreds of faceless people, but\nsomething will probably have become very clear. Everyone\nagrees that you should join clubs and become involved in\nthe Union as early as possible. What better way than to\nindulge your favourite sport.at whatever, Jevel you choose ?\nRecent\nSuccesses\nIC is justly proud of its\nsporting record which is second to none in the University\nand a lot better than many\nfull Universities. Last year\nteams from IC won the following University competitions :\nUL Seven-a side competition\n(rugby)\nUL Team Fencing Championship (for the third successive year)\nUL Swimming Championships\nUL Golf Championship\nUL Winter Regatta (3 class\nwins)\nUL Head of River race\nUL Allan Cup Regatta\nUL Girls' Hockey Championship\nand many other competitions\nbesides.\nWe also have three IC students in the University of\nLondon Olympic Eight, and\nGraham Paul is fencing for\nGreat Britain at Mexico. The\nIC clubs can be used as stepping stones to the University\nteams although in some sports\nthe IC teams are as strong or\neven stronger than the UL\nte.ams.\nFreshers'\nRole\nThere is no reason why this\nsuccess should not continue,\nbut we must have the vital\nsupport of the Freshers. It is\nsurprising how many fresher s make first teams almost\nimmediately; but it must be\nemphasised again that the\nrange of ability catered for\nis great if not extreme.\nMost trials will be held during the first week of term. Today, Wednesday, the Hockey\nRugby and Soccer clubs hold\ntheir Freshers' trials at Harlington and free (yes FREE)\ncoaches leave the Union arch\nfrom 1 p.m. onwards. For\ntrials in other sports see the\nnotice boards or the Club\nsecretaries and captains, or\nask in the Union bar.\nDEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification ?\nExercise your own\ndiscrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\nLAM LEY'S A jy| for your-^ BOOKS\n\u00a3 ART MATERIALS\nY PAPER BACKS\n; STATIONERY\ns1 EXHIBITION ROOD, S.W.7 Why the\nSuccess ?\nThere are many reasons\nwhy IC has been very successful at sport over the years, but\nexcellent facilities and an annual subsidy of about \u00a35000\ndoes help. You must have\nread about or he arc of the\nsuperb facilities at Harlington, which more than offsets\nthe 35 minute coach ride (4/-return). Arthur Loveday is\nresponsible for the maintenance of the pitches there\u2014\nand does a superb job, as\ndoes Mrs. Loveday with the\nmeals.\nThe Boat Club too, enjoy\nunique facilities with their\nown Club house on the\nThames at Putney. These\nunique facilities even extend\nto Pete's Cafe in Fulham\nPalace Road.\nSports Centre Closer at hand we have the\nnew Sports Centre. This\ncomprises a swimming pool,\nsquash courts, rifle range and\nother facilities by Cliff\nSpooner (he is the big fellow\nwith the 1956 Olympic blazer\n\u2014claims it's genuine!).\nHyde Park is also useful\nfor training and ogling (in\nseason). All this and more\ncan be had for an average\nannual subscription of 12/-.\nNot bad, eh?\nfreshmen' s informal DANCE for a small\noutlay, Topping\nentertainment.\nThis Saturday\nCOLLEGE\nMALTA\nEXPEDITION\nThe diver gave an unmistakable sign\u2014a single finger\ndrawn across the throat followed by a rapid point to an\nisolated rock. Stu was an experienced diver and would not\nhave given this danger signal for nothing\u2014yet nothing could\nbe seen. Finally, from less than two foot range, the danger\ncould be des cern ed.A scorpion fish, almost perfectly dis-guise d, was lying on the rock. Scorpeana Scrofa is described\nas one of the most poisonous European fishes. Recovery,\nif one is lucky enough to survive, can take up to several\nmonths.\nA Bite in Malta\nNine IC students spent two\nmonths this summer diving\noff Malta. The object of this\nscientific expedition was two-fold. To ascertain the accuracy with which an underwater swimmer can tell the\ndirection of an underwater\nsound source (i.e. Stereophonic hearing underwater), and\nto assemble and test some inflatable underwater \" mini-Houses.\" One of these s tru cAb ire in\na bite\nture s, generally known as\n\" Bites\" is shown in the\nphotograph. It is filled with\nbreathable air and contains\na telephone link to the shore!\nThere is room for two divers\ninside it at once and pockets\nfor tools and cameras. One\ndiver even ate his lunch there.\nSpectacular\nAccident\nA total of three Bites were\nused and on the day of the\nscorpion fish, all three were\ndown together. Each Bite\ndisplaced some \u00a3 of a ton,\nand on the occasion when the\nmooring cables broke in 130\nfeet of water, the sie ht was\nmost spectacular. The sea\nbecame so filled with small\nbubbles of air that it would\nnot support a person's weight.\nOne diver fell through this\n\" low density water \" some 20\nfeet before he realised quite\nwhat had happened.\nAll interested newcomers to\nthe College are also invited\nto come and visit us at our\nbaths training sessions.

    "content": "2 FELIX 2 October 1968\nACADEMIC FAILURES The usual start of session vacancies in top Union posts\nhave not failed to appear this year. For the second year\nrunning RCS has no President, although as the situation\nWas caused this time by the withdrawal of both candidates\nfor the post last summer\u2014in the event neither has returned\nto College\u2014the Union was able to appoint Jen Warren acting\nPresident. Nomination papers go up for this post on\nSaturday and will remain up for a week. So far no possible\ncandidates have been mentioned to FELIX. job it is rarely exam-wise an\nasset. The last two coordinators have failed their\n.- T4r*w Carnival Probably consistently the\nworst record in the Union is\nthat of Carnival co-or d in at or. This is the third year running that the holder of this\noffice has failed to return to\nCollege; this year as a change\nfrom the usual failure of\nexams or inability to secure\na postgraduate course, she got\nmarried. For those who do\neventually get landed with the\nbUU j ever, as last summer there\nseemed to be no shortage of\npeople wanting the job, this\nshould not be too hard for the\nCarnival Board to fill.\nEnts\nNext on the list of vacancies comes the Chairman of\nEnts, where Pete Nicholls has\nbeen unable to take up his\nduties due to exam failure.\nKeith Guy, last year's Chairman, appears to be the only\nperson both willing and able\nto carry out the job. This is\nanother post with a very bad\nrecord of incumbents not appearing at the beginning of\nsession.\nHalls Rep\nIn probably the most important year for a long time\nwith the opening of Linstead\nHall and the first two student\nhouses there is no Halls of\nResidence Representative.\nDick James, last year's Guilds Vice-President, did\nBring your grant cheque to the Midland Use it to start a bank account with\nthe Midland. Then\nwe'll very quickly\ngive you a cheque\nbook with which to\ndraw cash or pay\nbills.\nIt's nice to know\nyour money is\nabsolutely safe. But a bank\naccount with us promises you\nsomething more. A chance to\nbudget your money each term;\nand the right to go to your\nI bank manager for\nadvice \u2014 and help\n\u2014 on your finances.\nAnd while you're a full-time student,\nyou won't be asked\nto pay a penny in\ncharges, provided\nyou keep your\naccount in credit.\nGive your local Midland\nmanager a ring\u2014his number\nis in the 'phone book\u2014or go\nand see him about opening an\naccount. Do it now.\nMidland Bank\nnot manage to obtain a course\nfor this year. Bob Fryer, last\nyear's rep, has agreed to carry\non the duties until a new one\nis elected. Most likely candidate is Spike Bantin who is\ncurrently living in Linstead.\nExternal\nAffairs\nThe fate of the External\nAffairs Officer is at the time\nof writing not known. If\nDave Wield does not succeed\nin coming back to College\nthen an election will be held\nfor this post at the first Union\nmeeting of term on, 17th October. At this meeting\nan election will also be held\nto fill the vacancy as a floor\nrep on Council, created by\nlane Pearson's elevation to\nSecretary.\nFELIX On the home front, FELIX has come through the exams\nalmost unscathed. The only\nscheduled member of this\nyear's staff who failed was\nDick Middleton, intended\nNews Editor, for whom we\nrespectfully request a min-ute's silence.\nDRAM SOC IN\nHOLLAND The Dramatic Society\ntoured in Holland this vaca-tion, taking \" Roots\" by\nArnold Wesker. The play,\nproduced by Colin Harrison,\nwas rehearsed in London\nduring the first week of September and had a small invited audience for its final\ndress rehearsal.\nEncouraged by the response\nof the \" guinea pigs,\" the set,\nprops and costumes were\nsqueezed into a Ford Transit\nvan, except the tin bath which\nhad to travel on the roof, and\nthree people departed with it\n\" to Holland or Bust.\"\nThe other eighteen members in the group travelled by\nnight boat into alcoholic oblivion . . . and Holland. The\nfirst performance was given\nat a University Graduates\nClub in Eindhoven. The next\nperformance, at Utrecht, was\nthe second night of \" Motion\nWeek,\" organised for new\nstudents of the University.\nWe were invited to attend the\nopening night of motion week,\nwhich was a concert by the\nUtrecht Symphony Orchestra.\nWe then moved to Rotterdam and, quickly adapting\nthe play for \" theatre in the\nround,\" gave the third performance to our most friendly\nand appreciative audience.\nDuring our stay, we took over\na student club till the early\nhours, where we celebrated\nour successes boosted by a bottle of \" Bolo \" which we\nhad been given.\nOur last performance was\ngiven to students of the Institute of Dramatic Art in Amsterdam, whose appreciation\nwe valued greatly. After examining the finer points of\nnightlife in Amsterdam,\ntwenty one tired but triumphant students arrived home,\ndespite British Rail.\nOur thanks are due to the\nNetherlands-England Society\nfor arranging our stay in Holland, and I would like to\nthank and congratulate all\nmembers of the party for a very enjoyable show.\nPETE HARRIS President (ICDS)\nCYBERNETICS\nAT I.C.A. Probably the nearest thing to a true fusion of the Arts\nand Sciences which can be seen in London at present is the\n\" Cybernetic Serendipity \" computer art show at the Institute\nof Contemporary Arts on the Mall.\nThe exhibition attempts to present as many artistic possibilities in today's technology as possible and has exhibits\nranging from the old har monograph to music composed by\nor with the aid of computers; from robots which can sense\none another's presence and move accordingly to \" do it yourself \" patterns on a television screen produced by moving a strong magnet near to it; from exhibits where the frequency\nor intensity of sound in the vicinity affects a visual pattern to\npoetry produced by computers.\nthrough a Meccano once\ndetails of these see one ni the\nposters around the College.\nCybernetic Serpendipity is-on at the ICA gallery (at the\nbottom of the Duke of York\nsteps near Piccadilly Circus)\nuntil October 20th, open\nTuesday\u2014Saturday, 11 a.m.> \u2014\n6 p.m. and Sunday 2\u2014\n6 p.m. Admission is 8s. non\nmembers and 4s. for mem-be rs. DAVID COOPER\nPendula\nA fairly long (and for most\nscientists tedious) explanation\nof what cybernetics is appears\nj tt fct inside the door. Quite\nwhy there is this preoccupation\nwith the cybernetic angle is\ndifficult to understand, as\nprobably only about half the\nexhibits really owe anything\nto cybernetics\". The other exhibits seem to depend on random number generation by\ncomputers to other random\nprocesses, or work on the har-monograph tyre principle\nwhich, once it is set going . . .\njust produces a predetermined\npattern, or react to external\nstimuli rather than auto-stimuli. However this is a minor point. A more serious\ncriticism is the number of\nhar monograph type machines\nall producing those regular\ngeometric patterns. True they\ndon't all have those two pendulums rocking the table and\npen, but range over a great\nrange of sophistication\ndriven by electric motors\nmade by ex-I.C. student Roy\nAllen, to an IBM computer\nand Calcomp plotter.\nLectures\nDespite these criticisms the\nshow is well worth visiting\nwhether you are more interested in seeing computers,\npretty patterns, things going\nround, \" art\" or whether\nyou like pushing buttons to\nsee what happens. There\ncan have been very few art\nexhibitions at which a scientist can feel so at home (and\npossibly even at an advantage). Cybernetic, computer,\nor whatever you like to call\nit, art is still very much in its\ninfancy but it seems likely\nthat it will become an important part of science and engineering (and vice versa)\nbefore long.\nA series of lectures is being\ngiven along with the exhibition on the relationship between science and art.

    "content": "2 October 1968 FELIX 9\nFELIX PAGE I.C's own John Peel writes about LONDON'S SUMMER\nIn many ways it is a pity that the long vac is stuck right\nIn the middle of summer when London is really quite a nice\nplace to be. For lovers of music of all kinds, this has been\na very good summer. For classical fans there has been the\nProms, for those who like Indian music there was a chance\nto hear a series of ragas at the ICA one weekend, Ustad\nVillyat Khan doing two concerts at Swiss Cottage Odeon\nand another top sitarist, whose name I cannot remember, in\na free concert at the Victoria and Albert Museum. This was\na wonderful evening with a top Indian dancer for good\nmeasure and the Raphael Gallery (why do they call those\nthings cartoons ?) was packed out. But the pop 'music has,\nfor me, been the most exciting of all this summer with the\nSaturday afternoon free concert in Hyde Park.\nFirst Conceit\nThe first of these featured\nTyrranosaurus Rex and the\nPink Floyd. Currently riding\na wave of popularity following John Peel's frantic plugging on good old steam Radio\n(they also appeared at IC's Carnival Charity Concert in\nthe Albert Hall and at the\nMay Ball), Tyrranosaurus\nRex are a unique phenom e non. With most of the time\njust bongos and guitar their\nhighly individual style seems\nto require a rather more intimate atmosphere than that\nfound in the vast expanse of\nHyde Park. How long they\ncan stay in vogue will depend\nto a large extent on how\nmuch variation they can get\ninto the framework of their\nstyle. It certainly says quite\na lot for the present scene\nthat such an unusual sound\ncan be successful on more\nthan just novelty value. The\nPink Floyd are another highly\nindividual group who are curIt costs you nothing to make a friend at Barclays Look in at your nearest branch, and ask to see the manager.\nYou'll find he has plenty of experience in the vagaries of student\nfinance. He'll help you to open your account, and give you any\nadvice you may need on how to run it . . .\nHe'll ask you for a couple of specimen signatures and a quid or two.\nThen, providing you stay in credit, your 'Student Account' will be\nfree of all banking charges. And you'll have made a good friend\nfor the rest of your student days.\nBarclays Bank Money is our business\nrent ly enjoying commercial\n(and artistic) success. Their\nmusic seems to fall into two\ncategories. One is fairly normal good pop music and the\nother is something which defies classification. It isn't really electronic music, which\nis generally reckoned to be\nmusic from sounds created\nand manipulated by purely\nelectronic means, nor is it\nmusique concrete, which is\nmusic created by manipulating by tape or other electronic means sounds produced by normal instruments.\nCertainly it has elements of\nthese two in it but then their\nmusic is not artificial in the\nsense that it is produced by\nsplicing bits of tape together\nand playing the whole at the\nwrong speed, all their sounds\nare produced from what appear to be quite normal\ngroup instruments: electronic\norgan, electric guitar, drums\nand human voice. It seems\nto be the way in which they\nare played which produces\ntheir highly distinctive sounds.\nNo other group that I have\nheard has achieved such a high degree of integration of\nvoice with instruments that\nthe voice becomes an instrument and one can no longer\nthink of a piece as separated\ninto vocal and instrumental\npassage. Excellent examples\ncan be found on the tracks\n\"Let there be more light,\"\n\" Set the controls for the\nheart of the sun \" and \" Saucerful of secrets \" from their\n\" Saucerful of secrets \" LP( Columbia S CX6258) which\nis the best record I have\nheard this summer (one notable record I haven't heard\nyet is the Doors new one reviewed in this issue).\nTraffic\nThe second concert featured Juniors Eyes, a fast improving up and coming\ngroup, Traffic, who played\nvery well and seem to have\ngained cohesion with the return of Davie Mason, Pretty\nThings and the Action, but\nas far as I was concerned the stars were the\nNice who are really playing\nbrilliantly just now. To prove\nat one and the same time that\nthe charts are not all that bad\nbut could be better if their 6^\nminute masterpiece \" America \" got into the bottom of\nthe top 30. Still Arthur\nThe West Coast group the Doors, whose style of music featured was prominent\nin London this summer. (Photo by courtesy of Electra records.)\nBrown made Number 1 so\nthere is hope of better things.\nThe third concert had Ten\nYears After doing one block-busting 40 minute number\nupon their return from the\nStates, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac with their three\nlead guitars were fairly good\nbut not brilliant, the Fairport\nConvention who had just returned from holiday and\nsounded a bit rusty, and the\nDeviants whose organ had\nbroken down and were awful.\nTwo of the shows were\ncomp ered by Roy Harper,\nwho besides joki rl g and singing some of his excellent\nsongs, brought on some folk\nsingers, some out of the audi-en ce, who held their own\nwith all but the best of the\ngroups.\nAlbert Hall\nThe idea of these free concerts was imported from San\nFrancisco, where they are a regular feature. All credit to\nBlackh'l! enterprises who organised them, the Ministry of\nWork who allowed them and\nof course the groups who\nplayed.\nRecordwise, apart from the\naforementioned, \" The Rock\nMachine Turns You On\"( CBS PR22) (by assorted artists including Bob Dylan,\nLeonard Cohen, Moby Grape,\nThe Byrds, Simon and Garfunkel, Roy Harper and Tim\nRose) has some excellent\ntracks (and some rubbishy\nones) and is remarkable value\nat only 15/- for 15 tracks.\nThe Arthur Brown LP has\nbeen well worth waiting for\nand gets across the unique atmosphere which exists when\nthe Crazy World perform,\nprobably as well as is possible\non a record.\nDAVE COOPER.\nVigour and Passion\nTHE DOORS/WAITING FOR THE SUN\nElektra E UK4024. The Doors are an American group, well known in\nthe States, and beginning to be heard at large in this country,\nespecially since their recent visit.\n. Interest in the group usually centres on singer Jim\nMorrison, whose work has been described as poetry, and\nwhose stage performance has been branded as obscene.\nPolice departments seem to emphasise the latter view, and\nbeing bust by the cops is almost a regular part of their\nshows in the U.S. This kind of thing shows in their songs; while the\nlyrics are occasionally rather obtuse, the songs are full\nof vigour and passion. \" They've got the guns, but we've\ngot the numbers,\" says \"Five to One,\" one of the tracks.\nThe album also features the Doors' current single \" Hello\nI love you,\" and \" The Unknown Soldier.\" I found \"Spanish\nCaravan \" and \" Yes the river knows \" very_ pleasant, and\nI especially liked '*Not to touch the earth.\"\nThe Doors require a lot of listening to, partly because\nthe lyrics are important, and also because much of the\nmusic seems to sound alike at first. Actually to enjoy them\ntakes an effort. It can be worthwhile.\nB. FOON.\nThe Graduate\nComing to London after the vacation, you will maybe\nwish to catch up on the films which have opened since last\nJune. One that should be high on your list is \" The\nGraduate.\" The film concerns Benjamin, the graduate, who,\nfollowing a party given in his honour by his parents, is\nseduced by Mrs. Robinson, a family friend. This becomes a habit, broken only when Ben falls for Miss Robinson. In\nthe ensuing confusion we are treated to some very nice\nfilm of Ben chasing round Berkeley and across the Golden\nGate, after his girl.\nSuch a theme could easily turn \" The Graduate \" into a turgid mess, but under the direction of Mike Nichols we are\ngiven a very moving and sensitive film. It is also extremely\nfunny. Anne Bancroft is superb as the icy Mrs. Robinson,\nand newcomers Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross are as\ngood as the other leading parts. Music by Simon and Garfunkle gilds the lily: this is a most enjoyable film.\nJ. M URGA TROY D "

    "content": "2 October 1968 FELIX 5\nof a PRESIDENT and a SECRETARY FELIX crept along to the Union office some time last\nweek and talked to Rex Lowin, our new president, as he\nmunched his way through a cheese sandwich lunch. At last,\nmunched his way through a cheese sandwich lunch. At least.\nFELIX didn't say much, just listened to most of what he\nsaid.\nRex has already spent two years in I.C. Union council,\nthe first as Halls Rep. when he helped with the original\nStudent House report. He was heard to say at some time\n\"Only a mug could ever be Welfare Officer\" but, never-the less, last year he took on this exacting job, set up a committee to give some weight to the office and dealt with such\nthings as Rents, the Southside Coffee Bar and the c rec he for students with children.\nHe regards the Union generally to have two main\nreasons d'e tre. The first in the club system which accounts\nfor a large proportion of Union finance. The second in\nthe field of student welfare which covers things like academic\naffairs, external affairs and refectories. The second aspect\nis, Rex thinks, the most logical way for the Union too\nexpand its activities and there are the kind of services a Uninon should offer, although, having been tied up with this\nsort of thing for the past 18 months, he says he may be a little biased.\nA thing he wants improved is communication between the\nupper reaches of the Union and the general student body.\nTo further this he will be writing a regular column in FELIX and wants people to feel free to come in too the Union office\nand talk to people there. Another idea is to have a pending\ntray in the Union office so that people can come in and\nflip through it to find out what matters are under consideration n at the time instead of waiting until a Union meeting\nand finding out about things when a decision has been made\nand it is too late for discussion. This will a go towards\n\" encouraging an attitude where pe op e know ideas in their\nformative stage when they can be discussed \" instead of\nbeing presented with a fait ac comp li. WELCOME The I.C. BOOKSHOP is pleased to\nsee you now but we hope to give\nyou a better welcome in the new\nBookshop in 1969.\nWhen Jane Pearson arrived at IC several years ago,\nlittle did the average male Union member dream that she\nwould strike a blow for emancipation by becoming the first\never female Secretary of Imperial College Union. Never\nbefore has a woman risen so high in the Union hierarchy.\nWell qualified for the position, she has in the past been\nChairman of the Conservative Society and last year was\nPresident of ICWA. At the end of last year she topped the\npoll in the election of floor reps to ICU Council and was also\nelected vice-chairman of the London University Conservative\nAssociation. These two posts she resigned on being made\nSecretary, the latter \" not for political reasons \" but because\nof the amount of work her present post entails.\nThe function of the Secretary is to deal with correspondence, putting up minutes or, as Jane puts it, \" making sure\neverything gets churned out.\" Most of all she stresses that\none of the things ICU needs is improved communications.\nMore people should be able to find out what the executive\nand top members of the Union are doing and the pending\ntray idea should help. Personal contact is a valuable way\nof keeping in touch with the main body of the Union and,\nto quote Jane again, \" We want the Union office to be a place where people can come in and chat.\"\nPARKING\nSPACE\nStudents who wish to apply\nfor a College parking space\nmust get their application\nforms back to the Union\nOffice by tomorrow (3 rd\nOctober). 50 per cent of the\nresidents' spaces along with\n75 per cent of the commuters'\nspaces have still to be allocated and forms for the purpose may be obtained from\nthe Union Office under the\narch in Beit Quad.\nThose people who failed to\ngain spaces in the first allocation in September can rest\nassured that they will be considered for the second and last\nallocation. They need not\nsubmit another form unless\nthey have new reasons to support their case. People living\nin student houses can apply\nfor commuter spaces but\nFELIX doesn't think they'll\nhave much chance unless they\nbring in a truckload of people\nevery day. However, as\nconsolation for these, parking\nmeters won't invade the student houses area in Evelyn\nGardens until the end of\n1969, whereas they start operating in Queensgate and\nthe upper part of Gloucester\nRoad on December 2nd. Here, for yet another year, is our anonymous correspondent.\nColcutt. From his tower in Imperial Institute Road which has\nwithstood ravages of time, the pigeons and the demolition gang,\nge gives his bird's eye view of the Union\nra\nlb\nnn Welcome once again to I.C. and a special welcome to all\nthose who are reading Colcutt for the first time. At a quick\ncount that's your ninety-ninth welcome in three days. Here\nwe are at I.C. for another happy, hilarious, hard-working\nyear with all its petty arguments and political bickering at\nL'n ion and Council meetings. No doubt by now you have\nheard of that mysterious, all-powerful body we fondly know\nas Council and that it exists to safeguard your interest and\nto solve your problems. What do they achieve? NOTHING!\nAt least very little that is of interest or affects you.\nThey usually manage to find a convenient explanation\nof this. Two years ago it was apathy. The general student\nbody was, they all agreed, apathetic. You weren't in-te rested. You couldn't be bothered to come to Union\nmeetings and tell them what you wanted. So, naturally, the\nmeetings were in quo rate and there was nothing much they\ncould do about it.\nLast year they saw the folly of their ways. It wasn't you; it was them! They couldn't believe that you weren't avidly interested in what they were doing. Communications. That was the answer. You didn't know what was\ngoing on so how could you be expected to be interested.\nThey moved from the disease to the cause. After all, if noone knows there is a Union meeting you can't expect them\nto turn up.\nPerhaps a conversation overheard in the bar one night\nwill explain it.\nTypical Student : \" Boop-boo pad oop. Boop-boo pad oop.\" Council Member : \" How can you be so narrow? Aren'tv ou interested in broadening yourself?\"\nT.S.:\"N o!\"C M.:\"I don't suppose you know who the present Secretary of the Union is?\"\nT.S.: \"Harris?\"\nC.S.:\" It's Jane Pearson. Harris is dead! \"\nT.S.:\"I'm sorry to hear that. We can't afford to lose one\nconservative. Who's President now?\"\nCM.:\" Lowin, you dolt. Mr. Rex Lowin, formerly Welfare Officer.\"\nT.S.:\" Oh dear! I could never remember all that.\"\nNo, seriously folks, I'm sure this year is going to sec the\nbreak-through. Everything is safely in the hands of Sexy\nRexy and Plain Jane. So don't forget. Come along to the\nfirst Union meeting and see for yourself.

    "content": "4 FELIX 2 October 1968\nHEATHEN THOUGHTS \u2014 editorial\nListening to John Peel with the incessant chatter of\ntypewriters in the background is perhaps not the best environment to write an editorial in, but it's better than wrack-ing one's brain in the solitude of a bare Hall room. Getting\nback into the routine of writing FELIX is hard, but not as\nhard as the jobs several people in the Union have to do this\nyear. The Union Executive and Union Council, those supposedly ubiquitous bodies with their fingers, one hopes,\nfirmly on a \u00a320,000 purse and their thoughts at one with\nthe rest of us plebs, have a great burden of responsibility\nto bear. One hopes Council will not be rent by the internal\ndissension which raged in it last year. This year we have\ntwo experienced people as President and Secretary and, at\nfirst sight, what seems to be, for the most part, an efficient\nbody of council members who should work well together. But\n\u2014the proof of the pudding is in the eating and Council will\nbe judged on what it does and not what FELIX says about\nit beforehand.\nIt helps, of course, if the hierarchy of the Union is\nfriendly and approachable which brings us to what could\nagain turn out to be the magic word of the year\u2014COMMUNICATIONS. Communications, as FELIX defines it,\nis the art of letting everyone know exactly what's going on.\nIn previous years, very few people outside the inner circle\nhave known what the inner circle is doing or thinking about\nand this is bad because people become disillusioned and\nlost interest in the Union. This year Rex Lowin and Jane\nPearson seem to be tackling the problem with determination\n(read their profiles elsewhere in FELIX for a few details)\nbut they cannot succeed unless we try to take an active\ninterest in the affairs of ICU. Reading your FELIX will\nhelp to keep you informed but to get your views across really\nmeans going up to Union officers and talking to them. \u00a34\na year is paid to the Union on your behalf. Would you\ninvest \u00a34 on the Derby without having some say which horse\nit went on ?\nTo turn from taking an active interest in student affairs\nto taking an active interest in some of the affairs of the community as a whole, let us look at the work done by the Organisation for Social Service. In this issue Dave Chant\ndescribes some of the activities of this College society in\nhelping the aged and infirm in districts around the College.\nDave Penfold gives a wider description in the Union hand-book. I can't help thinking that the social service OSS\nundertakes does more immediate good than a score of\nmarches and demonstrations on Vietnam. This is not to\nsay that peace demonstrations are not a valuable way of\nexpressing our opinions on the suffering caused by war the\nworld over, but a student fight on poverty in this country\nmight help the populace to think our hearts are in the right\nplace and to listen more readily to our views on other\nmatters.\nHaving got all that off my chest, let me fit in a quick\nplug for FELIX. FELIX needs people with ideas, people\nwho can write or take photographs and people who are just\nkeen to help.

Lobachevski\nJOHN BETJEMAN,on the\nImperial Institute\nIn this article, John Betjeman, poet and expert on\narchitecture, talks about the old Imperial Institute which\nwas planned as an integral part of the South Kensington\narchitectural scene. John Betjeman played a prominent\npart in the fight against the demolition of the Institute.\nThe Imperial Institute in South Kensington was built\nbetween 1888 and 1891. It was subscribed for from all over\nthe British Empire, and private soldiers in India paid for\nthe bricks. For this reason bands ot bricks were given great\nprominence and used in the Portland stone exterior as\nthough they were of rare marble. The architect of this fine\nuninhibited building was Thomas Edward Collcutt, 1840-1924. Collcutt had been a draughtsman in the office of\nG.E. Street, the famous Gothic revival architect, who\ndesigned the Law Courts in the Strand, and inspired his\npupils, William Morris, Philip Webb and Norman Shaw,\nwho were much concerned with the arts and crafts movement of late Victorian times.\nCollcutt himself in reaction\nfrom the Gothic which was\nfashionable when he was a young man, designed one of\nhis first big public buildings,\nthe Town Hall at Wakefield,\nin a renaissance style of his\nown. This was further developed in the Imperial Institute, which owes something\nto Spanish renaissance, but is\nreally what might be called,\nthe Collcutt style. Inside, it\nhad suggestions of English\nJacobean. Collcutt resembled\nthe Gothic followers of Street\nin designing all the fittings for\nhis buildings, as well as the\nbuilding itself. He designed\nfurniture, stained glass s md light fittings. The most splendid example of his interior\nstyle, still surviving in London, is the interior of Lloyd's Registry of Shipping in Fenchurch Street (1900) with its\nstair, library and boardroom,\nand Brangwyn and'Frampton\npaintings and carvings. He\nalso designed the Palace\nTheatre and the Midland\nBank on Ludgate Hill.\nMUSEUM\nCOMPLEX\nThe Imperial Institute is\nthe heart and centre of the\ngreat complex of buildings in\nthe Museum district of South\nKensington. It was thought\nof as a permanent record in\nlasting material of the British\nsection of the Great Exhibition of 1851.\nIts tower is in line with\nthe Albert Memorial, the\ncentre of the Albert Hall, and\nwas to be seen between the\ntwo main towers of the Natural History Museum. This\nmuseum district was the most\ncomplete example of planned\npublic architecture, in the\nmost confident and prosperous\ntime of our country that we\npossessed. The Institute had\na grand entrance hall and\nstaircase, aptly described by\nH.S. Goodhart-Rendel as\n\" Happy and Glorious.\" To\nthe right and left of the central tower were offices and\nlecture halls, sumptuous ly decorated. Behind the central tower was to be a great\nhall for exhibiting the products of Empire, but this was\nnever completed. The central\ntower was, as it were, buttressed by the entrance hall, side\nbuildings and rear exhibition.\nIt was never designed to be\nseen standing on its own.\nSmaller towers, over the\nwings, led the eye up. to the\ngreat central feature.\nCollcutt, like Wren and all\ngood English architects, realised the importance of skyline in our generally grey\nclimate. The Imperial Institute had a most carefully\nconsidered skyline.\nDEMOLITION\nWhen the University authorities decided to enlarge\nImperial College on the site\nof the Institutue. many public\nbodies and private people\nurged the University to incorporate the Institute and its\ntowers in their plan, if a new\nbuilding on this site was regarded as really essential. The\nUniversity and the architects\nhad neither the imagination,\nwillingness or ability to do\nthis. There was still a spirit\nof old world with i try lingering from the 1930's and the\nImperial Institute was\nthought fussy, dust-collecting\nand old fashioned. So carefully detailed, grandly scaled\nand joyful a building would\nprobably have survived, if its\ndemolition had been proposed today. As it is, we\nhave at least been left the\noutline of Callcutt's tower,\nas seen from Hyde Park. And\nLondoners can be grateful for\nthis small mercy.\nJOHN BET JEM AN The Imperial Institute, an original sketch\nCourtesy of the R.I.B.A. Advertising Agency:\nJ. E.P. and Associates. Tel:013533712 THE SWANN REPORT Drastic changes in postgraduate courses in science and\ntechnology are called for in a Government White Paper\npublished on September 25th. The report has been produced by the working group on\nmanpower for scientific growth, whose chairman is Professor\nMichael Swann, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh\nUniversity and it examines the relation between the demands\nof industry and University education. It finds that too many\ngraduate scientists and technologists are staying in Universities and going abroad, with too few into industry and\nteaching. One of the effects of this is that the age balance\nof science teachers in schools is disproportionately old, this\nis also true of teachers in colleges of education and further\neducation whilst in universities, the bias is strongly towards\nyounger age groups. More than 70 per cent of first class\nhonours graduates go on to higher degrees and less than\nJO per cent go into industry and schools.\nTo combat this situation\nthe report makes a number of\nrecommendations. Teachers\nof science and mathematics\nshould be more highly paid\nthan those in other subjects to\ntry to attract graduates into\nthis branch, there should be\nmerit additions for people\nwho have taken approved\nhigher degrees or had industrial experience and more\ngraduates should have teaching experience during their\nuniversities careers, preparation for teaching could become part of a first degree\ncourse without lengthening\nthe time spent at university.\nAs far as industry is concerned the committee says\nthat industrialists must see\nthat graduates are offered \"at-tractive and challenging careers \" and also make the ii needs clearly known to universities and become intimately involved with all aspects of postgraduate courses,\nincluding their support.\nClearly the financial incentives must be there to attract\npeople into industry.\nIn the University sphere,\ndrastic changes in postgraduate courses are called for. If\nthe report's recommendations\nare implemented, the already\nTapidly shrinking number of\nPhD students would be even\nless and the PhD courses\nwill become \" more closely\norientated to the needs of\nindustry.\" The emphasis in\npostgraduate courses would\nshift to industry-orientated\nand shorter courses and the\nproportion of students taking\npostgraduate courses after\nspending some time in industry would increase.\nDAVID COOPER.\n\n"

The swimming\npool and rifle range will not be open until next Monday.\nThe squash courts have been beset by even more misfortune\nand will not be open until the start of November.\nAdolf Hashteroudian\nRAY PHILLIPS\nSUB-WARDEN\nFlooding The cause of the delay is\nprincipally a failure of the\ncontroller valves of the heating system. These suddenly\ngave up the ghost and the engineers had to be called back\nin to deal with them. During\nthe same outbreak of rain\nthat caused the chaotic flooding in South-East England,\npart of a sewage main was\noverburdened with the flow\nand pools of water appeared\non the squash courts. Consequently the floors of these\nhave to be relaid. Mr. Stephenson, Senior Warden and\nchairman of the Sports Centre\nSteering Committee also said\nthat there was trouble in securing messengers, but this\nwould not delay the opening.\nHot Air When the heating plant is\nfunctioning properly the\nswimming pool will even have\nhot air circulating around it.\nThere will be three attendants\nfor the pool (not all working\nat the same time), under the\ncharge of Mr. Spooner, a member of 1956 Olympic\nwater-polo team and ex-baths\nsuperintendent at Wolverhampton and Llanelli.\nThe inside story of the\nsports centre is contained in\nthe President's column on\nPage 7.\nU.G.C. Stop Building In August the Government\n(through the University Grants\nCommittee) put a six month\nstop to all University building for which contracts have\nnot yet been signed.\nWhen asked by FELIX about the effect this would\nhave on IC, Mr. M.J. Da vies,\nthe Secretary of the College,\nsaid that as no major financial\nprojects were about to start\nduring this period the immediate effect would not be\nserious. However, he did not\nknow what the long-term\neffect might be.\nThis summer, Ray Phillips,\nlast year's President, was appointed sub-warden of the\nStudent house. While this\npost was not mentioned in\nthe report which was used as\na basis for setting up student\nhouses it seems a very good\nidea.\nThe possibility of such a post first arose out of discus-s ions n between Mr. Minton,\nthen warden of Garden Hall,\nand Dave Harris, the warden\nof the student house. (Dave\nwas appointed by Ray Phillips and the Rector at the be*\nginning of last session.) Garden Hall had many of the discipline problems that it was\nanticipated might occur in\nstudent houses. The idea received official approval in\nFebruary, and at about that\ntime a vague mention of it\nwas made at a Union Executive meeting.\nJoint CounciI\nOn the 12th June, Ray was\nofficially appointed sub-war-den on the recommendation\nof Dave Harris with the approval of the Rector. This\nwas only three days after\nJoint Council when it had\nbeen decided that the wardens of student houses should\nbe approved by Council. Ray\nPhillips has since said that it\nnever occurred to him to\nmention the post of sub-war-den, and Dave Harris seems\nto regard the post as entirely\nthe business of the warden\nand says that Council did not\nseem interested in student\nhouses anyway. Ray now\nadmits that the circumstances\nunder which he was appointed look a little fishy, but\nagrees with Dave that Council was apathetic on the sub-j ect. Uninformed\nRex Lowin, this year's President, who was Welfare\nOfficer last year, said that he\nwas told that student houses\nwere none of his business. He\nnow regrets not keeping himself well abreast on developments on this front.\nRay describes his job more\nas a senior resident, as the\nonly perk he gets is a slightly\nbetter room than the other\nresidents. He says that his\npresence is necessary because\nfire regulations would otherwise make it impossible for\nDave Harris and his wife to\ngo out.\nVicePresident fined RCS Vice-President Javad \"Adolf\" Hashteroudian\nwas arrested at the last big Vietnam de most ration stm Sunday, July 21st, and subsequently fined \u00a325 and given a three\nmonths suspended sentence. The following is an account\nof what happened, as told to FELIX by Hashteroudian.\nHe was taking part in the demonstration in Park Lane\n(where a lot of damage was done by demonstrators) and was\namongst a lot of other people, some of whom were throwing\nstones at policemen. When the police charged he was writing\npoetry and did not run off when the rest did. He was\narrested for allegedly throwing stones at the police and the\narresting officer hit him on the back of the head with his\ntruncheon.\nNo Bail\nHe was then taken with the\nrest of the people arrested to\nWest Central Police Station\nand by the evening everyone\nexcept Javad and three others\nhad been bailed out. His girl\nfriend, having guessed what\nhad happened, had gone\nalong to the police station to\nbail him out but had been re-fused. Moreover, he was told\nthat no-one had come.\nNext day before going into\ncourt the policeman who arrested him told him that he\nwould not oppose bail, but\nthe police solicitor did oppose\nit on the grounds that he\nmight try to leave the country\n(he is Persian). He was remanded for nine days and\ntaken to Brixton prison,\nwhere he was kept alone for\n22 hours a day with an hour's exercise and allowed two visitors each day. This appears\nto be standard treatment for\nall remanded prisoners.\nPassport\nMeanwhile Ron Bass, a friend of Javad, had found a solicitor, through the National Council for Civil Liberties,\nwho was willing to take the\ncase and Dr. Stephen Rose of\nthe Biochemistry Department,\na well-known opponent of research into chemical and biological warfare, had been\ncontacted and agreed to act as\nsurety for Hashteroudian. He\nwas released on bail on the\nFriday upon surrendering his three years, a \u00a325 fine and or-passport. de red to pay ten guineas costs.\nOn 30th July he was remanded on bail again until\n10th August when he was\nonce again remanded until 4th September. He was told that\nother charges might be\nbrought against him as well\nas the one of assaulting a police officer, but in fact\nnone were.\nThe day before his case\nwent before the Magistrate's Court his barrister advised\nhim to plead guilty on the\ngrounds that the magistrate\nwould almost certainly believe the police. He agreed\nto this as long as he did not\nhave to say anything.\nHearing\nAt the hearing on September 4th, the arresting officer\nwas not present in court and\nanother policemen read a statement written by him.\nThe police claimed that\nHashteroudian had thrown a stone which hit the policeman\non the shoulder but did not\nhurt him. When the police\ncharged he ran off with everyone else. The officer had his\ntruncheon out, Hashteroudian\nturned round and appeared to\nhave a stone in his hand and\nwas about to hit him. He\nducked and aimed his truncheon at Hashteroudian's shoulder, who also ducked,\nso accidentally being hit on\nthe back of the head.\nJavad's barrister told the\ncourt that he had a good\ncharacter and a good record\nas a student and was sorry.\nHe was given a sentence of\nthree months, suspended for\n\n"

However it deplores the decision to aw rd only \u00a325 out of the \u00a350\nincrease estimated by the Brown advisory panel on student maintenance\ngrants as necessary to maintain the students' standard of living and\nrequests that this decision be reviewed before the I969/70 session. The recommendation of the Brown advisory panel.was to maintain\nthe real value of undergraduate and equivalent awards. The Government,\nby not implementing these recommendations, has lowered the student .\nstandard of living for the second time since 19^2. The standard of\nliving of students must now be increased by li^bin order to raise it to\nthe I962 level. In 1959 the present chancellor Ray Jenkins wrote in \"The Labour\nCase\" that many students then suffered from being on a generally\ninadequate (income) scale and also said that the state must take\nresponsibly for a rather greater generosity in all respects and for parti cation he said that this would involve a more generous policy on\nstudent grants.\nProm our observation it io appa rant that the case for increasing\nstudent grants is at present even stronger.\nWe believe that the Government should treat more expenditure on\nUniversity education is an investment rather than a waste.\nWe believe that if the Government continues to adopt policies which lower student living standards the present shortage of graduates\nin science and technology will become more acute and the Government\nmay be held responsible for Britain failing to become more economically\nviable in the highly competitive technological world of today.\nat a meeting of I.C.U. council on Monday night, it was decided\nthat council would try to lower the ars nt a of student houses. The\nmatter aro a e out of a report submitted by Dave Harris, the student\nhouse warden, which indicated rents could be lowered by 10/~ per person\nper week without the house running at a loss. Bob Fryer, acting Halls Rep, pushed through a action covering this point as well as recommending\nthat the basic rent should include such things as heating, lighting and\nthe supply of bed linen.

    "content": "8 FELIX 2 October 1968\nO.S.S. IN\nLABOUR\nThe Organisation for Social Service work parties is\ntailor made for anyone in the college who enjoys spending\nsome of their weekends decorating, renovating or even window cleaning from time to time! Work parties are probably the most widely known aspect of O.S.S. Many more\nstudents participate in these than the other vital but less\npublicised sides of O.S.S. The bulk of the jobs undertaken in work parties involve\ninterior decorating. Often\nwe spend a weekend completely redecorating one or\ntwo rooms for elderly or disabled people who^ cannot\nafford professional help and\nwho certainly cannot manage\nto do the job themselves. The\nwork is rarely completely\nstraightforward as the majority of places visited were\nhardly built yesterday ! We\noften have to contend with\ncrumbling plaster, rotten wood\ndamp and peculiarly shaped\nrooms. But there is some\nsatisfaction to be gained in\nturning an often cheerless\ndwelling into a more colour-ful, pleasant home; with\nquite a few people mucking\nin, the transformation can\nusually be done in a weekend.\nFor budding \" do-it-your-self ' students there is always plenty of practice here\nin plastering, painting, wallpaper hanging and general\nrenovating. Other indoor\nio bs include decorating large\nhouses taken over by local\ncharitable organisations to\nprepare them for homeless\nfamilies.\nPOP IN\nAttendance at work parties\ncan be regular or sporadic,\nexactly as you please. Often\npeople only pop in for a couple of hours on a a Saturday or Sunday while others\nspend both days on the job.\nHowever long anyone spends,\nthey are always only too we l come. In this connection, details of our activities go up\nearly each week (the notice\nboard is just outside the lower\nrefectory on the same side as\nthe gent's toilet!)\nOutside jobs in the past\nhave mainly been in connection with the Notting\nHill Adventure Playground\nwhere O.S.S. helped in the\nconstruction of a large rehearsal hut for the amazing\n\" Steel Band.\" This involved\nvery careful planning and\nsome quite heavy work over\nmany weekends, as well as\nplaying football with the local\nkids at the playground. All the experience gained can\ncome in very handy in later\nlife, though experience itself,\nalthough welcome, is not ne-cesar y on our jobs. After all,\nanybody can put up wallpaper and bang in a few nails\nhere and there.\nBIZARRE\nAmong other more bizarre\njobs, we have spent a weekend at the Golborne Road\nRehabilitation Centre being\nhelped and hindered by the\nex-convict occupants in renovating their vast dormitory.\nAlso, when the floor of a preschool play-group hut in\nNorthKensington collapsed in\nthe winter, we helped relay\nthe floor in remarkably damp\nweather conditions which, peculiarly enough, quite added\nto the occasion.\nMany, if not the majority,\nof weekends are run in conjunction with Bedford College, which tends to supply\nrather more lady decorators\nthan I.C. If you are interested, why\nnot sign on for our first weekend on October 5/6, for details see Southside notice\nboard. Also our Freshers'\nEvening on Friday 4th. October in the Upper Union\nLounge at 19.00.\nDAVE CHANT\nHOUSY-LOUSY\nThe \" Entryphone \" is indeed a wondrous invention.\nWith this electric butler, it is possible for visitors to communicate by word of mouth with beings in any part of the\nbuilding in which it is installed and be allowed access to the\ninterior of said building by the contacted host. All this at\nthe pressing of two buttons.\nWhen I was faced with this simple task, I was standing,\nsurrounded by suitcases, in the porch of 55 Evelyn Gardens\n\u2014my student house, home for the next session.\nI pressed the button marked \" Warden \" then a second\ntime and once more for (fabled) \" luck \". The Warden\nbeing out, I commenced to press random buttons in the foolish belief that I would make contact with persons inside.\nNothing. I was greatly relieved when a smart, smiling young\nfellow bounded up to the door and let me in with the words\n\"Hello, I'm sub-warden Ray Phillips and I 've been moving\nfurniture,\" Strange!\nBE\nUNPREPARED\nHe led me through plaster\nspattered corridors and perilous un lit staircases of extensive gradient to the basement of the building where\nhe showed me a splendid\nroom. Unbelievably vast,\nit boasted central heating, an\nadjoining room with new\nelectric cooker and wall\nheater and, to cap it all, it was\ncompletely UNFURNISHED with the latest open plan\nstyling.\n\" Yes,\" he said \" I'm sorry about the cooker, it was\nput there by mistake but\nwe'll soon remove it for you.\"\nGrief!\n\" Ah well,\" quoth he \" I must leave you now, some\nfool's messing about with the\nEntryphone.\"\nThe structure of the student house could well be\ndescribed as a\" Garden Hall\nwith knobs on,\" i.e. diverse\nand multi-directional. Someone also had the clever idea\nof putting the warden's flat\nin the middle of the building.\nThus, to reach the upper floor\nof the central building it is\nnecessary either to cut\nthrough to the outer staircases and climb past this or\nhave the embarrassment of\ngetting a chance view of the\npersonal life of \" The Guvnor.\" But seriously, folks,\nmost walls are (as you can\nnow imagine) unpainted or\nbear remnants of the previous occupants paint\nDO IT\nYOURSELF\nWhen I eventually got another room with things as useful as beds in, I found the\nwhole furniture system to be\ndo-it-yourself. You make\nyour own beds (with your own\nsheets) and you sweep your\nown floors. Who knows, perhaps you paint your own\nwall (with your own brushes,\nnaturally).\nBy the way, at the time this\nissue went to press, my allotted room had the furniture I was to be using in, but it had\nto be unwrapped first.\n\u2022 m^_^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.i \u2014 . ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nFind out first-hand what life is like as a Patent Examiner.*\nYou would be surprised to learn\nhow interesting a career as a Patent\nExaminer can be. Accept this invitation\nto visit us at the Patent Office and\nfind out all about it first-hand.\nBasically the job of the Patent\nExaminer is to vet applications for the\npatenting of new ideas in electrical,\nmechanical, chemical and other fields.\nWhen you join you are assigned to\na senior Examiner who will start you\noff on the less complicated\nspecifications, to give you the chance\nto grasp the mechanics of the task.\nAs your aptitude develops so you will\nbe given more and more demanding\nwork and with less and less\nsupervision, until eventually you work\nentirely on your own.\nMake no mistake about it, to meet\nthe challenge which this kind of work\ninvolves, you need an enquiring mind\nand the ability to develop your critical\nand analytical faculties to the highest\ndegree. And you have to be prepared to\nargue your case with the applicant or\nhis professional advisers.\nYou will earn an excellent salary,\nstarting at \u00a31,116 and reaching \u00a31,870\nafter 3-5 years. Virtually all examiners\nreach senior grade, salary up to \u00a33,625.\nThis grade can be reached in 8-10 years.\nHolidays are significantly better than\nyou could expect in industry.\nNon-contributory pension.\nNow you have an outline idea of\nthe job. If you would like to find out\nmore, please write to Mr. C. I.L. Smith,\nThe Patent Office, 25 Southampton\nBuildings, London, W.C.2. He will send\nyou full details, and you can then\narrange a day to visit the Patent Office.\nYou must have or expect to obtain a First or\nSecond Class Honours degree in engineering,\nphysics, chemistry, or mathematics, or an\nequivalent qualification, such as Corporate\nmembership of the I.

    "content": "2 October 1968 FELIX\nPRESIDENT'S COLUMN This article is to be the first of a regular series, and I would like to explain why I am writing them. The idea is\nnot to set up as a rival to Colcutt, but as a supplement to\nhim. The Union has two main facets; the club structure,\nalready very well developed, and the other services to students which can be described under the very general heading\nof student welfare. The latter structure has really begun to\ngrow over the last two years, and covers such things as\nstudent housing, sports facilities, and refectory facilities.\nSince these projects are large and often costly, they involve\nco-operation between the Students Union and the College\nAdministration. This usually means that any advanced\ninformation comes through the President and perhaps four\nor five other students. In the past any such information has\noften filtered down only slowly to the majority of students.\nI hope to use this column to throw such topics open to the\nUnion at as early a stage as possible so that everybody has\naccess to previously inside information.\nSPORTS CENTRE The first topic that I would like to deal with is the\nnew Sports Centre in Princes Gardens. This will provide\na swimming pool (82ft. x40 ft.), four squash courts and a rifle\nrange. The contractors have just moved out and if the\nheating system is willing, the swimming pool and rifle range\nshould open on Monday. The squash courts suffered in the\nrecent rain and it may be several weeks before they are\nready.\nThe initial planning of the Sports Centre goes back\nmany years, and about three years ago a steering committee\nwith two student reps was set up to help in its development.\nThe final cost has been just over a quarter of a million\npounds, about half coming from the College and the rest\ncoming from grants to the College. The committee decided\nthat the Centre should be a general College facility, open to\nboth students and College employees unlike the Gym which\nis college owned and run.\nBOB A DIP It was also agreed that some payment would be required\ntowards offsetting the heavy running costs, estimated at\n\u00a319,000. The entrance charge of a shilling covers admission\nto the pool and squash courts during open sessions. In\naddition, some sessions will be reserved for Union clubs, and\nthe rifle club will have sole use of the firing range. These\nsessions will be free and for club members only, the costs\nbeing met by a Union block grant to the Centre, in line with\nthe normal club subsidies.\nThe Sports Centre will be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. There is to\nbe no Sunday opening at the moment since this would add\nconsiderably to the running costs, but the situation is to be\nreviewed during the year. If enough people want to use the\npool on Sundays, then I hope we shall be able to manage\nSunday opening.\nDo you write:\nShort stories ? Poems ?\nArticles of depth and\nvision, compulsive,\nserious, witty ?\nOr do you draw, scribe,\nor create drawings,\ns crib in gs or creations\nof amazing style and\nbeauty ?\nOr do you just wake up\nnights with incredible\nideas ?\nSend the fruits of your\ntalent to John Mullaly,\nAero 3 or Union rack.\nLike men, we need it.\nPHOENIX JANET IS HERE\nWith the departure of Mrs. Robinson to Educational\npublicity, FELIX' s old advertising agents, Janet Hughes has\ntaken over the post of Union Clerk.
