    "content": "FELIX IMPERIAL HONOURS S//? REGINALD\nBreakfast in the Union Building can be\na dull routine on the best of days, and\nusually only the head-lines in the 'Tele-graph' or the adventures of Flook serve\nto relieve the monotony. However, far\nthose students who were here on January\n1st, there was the attraction of reading\nthrough the columns of closely printed\nnames in the 'Times'; the recipients of\nthe New Years Honours. For most of us\nthey are, at the best, a name we might\nhave heard of, a business acquaintance\nof our father* s, or a distant uncle on\nthe Town Counoil at home. In fact, it is only rarely that we o an claim to know\none of them personally, and, in our own\nsmall way, share in the pleasure.\nThis year, however, there is one\nwhom we all know personally; someone\nwho first o a me to Imperial College as a student of Chemistry in 1920, and returned later as the Professor of Organic Chemistry - none other than the\nReotor. His extensive academic and\nscientific achievements are well-known\nand occupy more than the average amount\nof space in Who's who, but it is not\nthus that the students of I.e. think of\nhim.\nTo the more fortunate ones, who\nhave come to know him since 1955 when\nhe was appointed, he is a sympathetic\nand understanding friend, only too\nwilling to listen to the problems of\nthe students. He has been the driving force behind the expansion of the\nCollege, not only academically, but also\nalong social and recreational lines, as\nwitnessed by the development of the\nPrinces Gardens site.\nIt is for this reason that the\nRector and Mrs. Linstead have earned\nthe respect of all the students, and we\noffer him our heartfelt congratulations I upon the well-deserved reward of a knight\nhood.\nR.B. T.G. Congratulations are also due to Mr.\nH.R. Hewer, Asst.-Prof of the Zoology\nDepartment. His organisation of the\nInternational Congress of Zoology, last\nsummer have already won him international praise. Members of his department are\nvery pleased to see that this popular\nfigure has bean awarded the O.B.E. M. R.H. IC DRAMATIC SOCIETY\nCHRISTMAS PRODUCTION\nTHE MISER Moliere was a master at depicting\nohara ot ers, and in THE MISER - one of\nhis many satires on an immensely\nshrewd middle class in17 th Century _\nPrance - he has used them with excellent effect.\nMoliere'3 plays are firmly\nrooted in the theatre, Whether they\nare flatly acted, or produced in trans-la tion, the plays are sure of success\nbecause the playwright has foreseen\nand overcome many of the obstacles of\ntheatrical production. Nevertheless,\nit should be borne in mind that the\nplays were written for audiences which\ncould see sections of their own community portrayed upon the stage: the\nplot was a neo ess ary, but definitely\na secondary, consideration. Hence the\npredominant atmosphere throughout \"The\nMiser\" is healthy, and one can enjoy\nthe mockery of rid i ou lou s excess, but,\nas on this occasion, the unravelling\nof the plot at the end is often .greeted\nwith awkward amusement.\nThis may be accounted for by\nthe fact that the devil, in this case\nHarpagon, is an old and harmless\nfavourite in comedy, and when his vio-tim s appear on the stage one likes to\nfeel sure that their writhing s are\nmerely simulated. In Moliere's com-ed y, unlike tragedy, the dream which is\nbroken at the end has been seen by\nthe audie no e to be foolish from the\noutset, and its breaking is a matter\nfor laughter in wh i oh the dreamer must\nappear to join. Hence the arbitrary\nand artificial denouements for wh i oh Moliere is renowned - they result, not\nfrom an inability to handle plot, but\nfrom a theatrical necessity to escape\nthe logic of characters which must\notherwise lead to the tragic.\nThe production at the end of last\nterm by the I.e. Dramatic Society was\nexcellent, and showed a marked improvement over some of their other recent\nplays: while it is always possible to\nfind, fault with anything, let it be\nsaid that any mentioned here are intended as suggestions, and did in no way\ndetract from the good of the whole.\nCleante (Michael Spence) holds forth to\nan attentive audie no e.A scene from Leslie Allen's pro duo tion of Moliere's comt fy last term.\nlb** i \u00bb\u00abr( Derek Baylies) listens\nvary carefully to Cleante (Michael\nSpenoe.\nDerek Bayliss, as the Miser, gave\nhis best performance yet, and his\ndiatribe on discovering the theft of\nhis jewellery, probably the most difficult so ene of the play in which to be\nconvincing, was a sheer delight to\nwatch. Harpagon's son, Cleante, was\ngiven a very creditable performance by\nMichael Spence, and his daughter, Elise,\nwas well portrayed by Sheila Burbidge\n(she has improved since \"The Firstborn\" into quite a polished actress).\nOthers who cannot be forgotten,\neven in a very swift glance, are Leslie\nAllen us a scintillating La Fleche,\nand Peter Bowden as the hopelessly\nconfused Justice of the Peace: also\nwe were-given a wonderful, and most\nenjoyable, piece of acting by Shelagh\nHocking as Proisine, a so her a ing woman,\nexcept that her interpretation of the\npart was too pert and saucy to be in\nkeeping with such a person in Moliere's time.\nThe actors were supported by a well-designed set and effective light-ing, although no impression was given\nof the different times of day depicted\n(admittedly this would have been\ndifficult with the painted window):\nthe costumes were good and comprehensive, but in some oases too modern\nfor the period, and mu oh credit is due\nto the members of I. C.W. A. who helped\nin their making.\nFor a most pleasant evening's entertainment, thanks are due to the\nproducer, Leslie Allen: may there be\nmore productions of similar calibre in\nthe future.\nP.J.C.

    "content": "6\nFELIX PERSONAL VIEW\nDEBATING AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nLecture notes, example sheets\nand laboratory reports are a heavy\nyoke to bear, so it is only natural\nthat every student should seek some\nmeans of relaxation: some outlet of\nself expression. One may prefer\nscrunching other people's heads into\nthe ground at Had. in gt on, or another\nmay be finds breaking arms in the\nsophisticated Japanese fashion more\nto his taste. (One man's meat is another man's poison). My own\nparticular relaxation is debating,\nbecause I rather like being rude\npolitely and there is,to my mind,\nnothing like a good scrap over re li gion or politics.\nOf course, not all the debates\ncom-'i it tee are as intellectual as I and they have to be humour ed by the\nslipping in the odd intellectual motion like: \"This House prefers a Saucy Sue to a Lovely Lucy\", whereupon I have to entertain the visiting\nspeakers from Bedford College to coffee\nafterwards (because that is the only\npolite thing to do).\nWhenever someone starts a speech\nby saying: \"Unaccustomed to public\nspeaking as I am \" you can be\nsure there is a good time coming, as\nhe is obviously an old hand. You may\nhave noticed quite a number of old\nhands around the college, and we hoping\nthey will be pressed into service again\nfor this term's programme. Among the\nforthcoming battle slogans are:\n\"This House prefers thermometers\nto spanners*\n\"That Britain's Nuclear Policy\nis Inconsequent\"\nand \"That this House should\nadjourn indefinitely\"\n(which will not be regarded as a motion bf confidence).\nI will not give you all that\nfresher's letter stuff about how good\nit is for you to learn the art of putting your thoughts into words. Quit*\nfrankly I do not think debating does\nmuch good for you at all, the only\nthing that I have acquired since Joining the debates oom mitte e being a liking for drawing wicked posters. In\nfact, you oom e to debates at your own\nrisk. (I look forward to seeing you\nthere.)\nFinally.on a rather less flippant\nnote, the debates committee is anxious\nthat the society should be a true\nreflex ion of oo lle ge opinion and we are\nalways ready to hear suggestions for\nmotions from any member of the Union.\nThese Vshould be addressed via the Union\nRack to the President of Debates, who\nwill deal with them suitably.\nWith which, Mr. Editor, I declare\nthe House adjourned.\nR.D. Finch\nPresident, Literary and\nDebating Society.\nUNION DEBATE The traditional motion: \"That\nthis House has no confidence in Her\nMajesty's Government\", debated on 4th December was unique in that it was\ndefeated for the first time in several\nyears.\nMr. Desmond Donnelly MP who\nproposed the motion went to great\npains to explain that there really\nwas a difference between the Conservative and Labour parties. Apparently\nthe House was unimpressed.\nIntroducing Mr. Anthony Kershaw\nMP as a past Secretary of the Conservative Parliamentary Army Sub-Ctte. and\npast Parliamentary Private Secretary\nto the Secretary of State for War and\nDefence, Mr. Richard Garnett said he\nexpected a fine warlike speech. However, Mr. Kershaw remained on the\ndefensive, proud to be associated with\nthe Government's record of achieve-ment s. John Cox, seconding the motion,\ndecided to o on cent rate on education\nalone, attacking the proposed government expenditure of \u00a3400mp.a. on\neducation as totally inadequate.\nCox's failure to make an all round declamation of Tory policy left\nMartin Bames, seconding the opp osi tion, in a quandary. He could only\nanswer the points he thought Cox might\nhave made.\nA number of lively speeches from\nthe floor condemned the government for\nrising prices, unemployment and outdated foreign and colonial policies.\nNor was the government without vocal\nsupporters, some of whom rose to speak.\nOne speaker at least this year thought\nthat government should be taken out of\npolitics.\nMr. Kershaw summed up by answering\nthe allegations; made against the govern-ment. While Mr. Donnelly described\nMr. Kershaw's speech in the way that\nthe Texans describe the horns of a steer, there being a point here and a point there, but an awful lot of bull\nin between.\nThe motion was defeated by 60\nvotes to 56 with 13 abstentions.\nR.D. Finch.\nGUILDS CARNIVAL MODERN ART The treatment of the surface and\nof the colour of a painting is an\nessential feature of Modern Art, said\nBasil Taylor, Librarian of the Royal\nCollege of Art, who was introducing a series of five General Studies lectures\non Modern Art to be held this term.\nThe ol as sio al idea of the surface of a painting was that it acted as a window which led to a three dimensional\nworld beyond. In contrast, many of\nthe moderns treated the surface as\na solid impenetrable barrier so that\nthe painting slapped the viewer in the\nface.\nBasil Taylor illustrated these\npoints with a variety of art from a variety of art from a two dimensional\nmediaeval book illustration through the\nclassical age and the impressionists to\nthe abstracts and the fauves. He\nshowed a Deraln with a river green and\nthe sky red to illustrate what part\ncolour played in the grammar of Modern\nArt. There were reproductions of\nMonet, Cezanne , Gauguin, Kandinsky\nand Piet Mondrian. One thing to bear\nin mind all the time, suggested Basil\nTaylor, was that, due to the decline\nin patronised art, the contemporary\nartist was self employed and was therefore concerned to express a personal\nphilosophy. A particularly startling\nPaul KLee was shown to emphasise this.\nFurther lectures in this provo oat ive series will be: Jan. 13th, Cubism; Feb. 3rd, Fauves and Expre3sianism; Feb. 19th, Abstracts; Mar.\n12th Surrealism.\nP.

    "content": "FELIX5 LETTERS THE PHOENIX CONTROVERSY Dear Sir,\nI know that I am not alone,\nwhen I express m ji views about the last\nedition of 'Phoenix'.\nMr. D.J. Irving must realize that\nthe magazine is an outlet and a show\npiece for the literary works of members\nof I.C., and must to some extent reflect\nthe nature of our College.\nWhat has happened to Mr. Hill's Social Page this term?\nMessrs Irving, Jarman and Wheeler\nhave almost monopolized the magazine.\nIs this the purpose of the Editorial\nStaff?\nMr. Wheeler has succeeded in getting his name into print twenty times,\nalso his photograph, a competition egotistically entitled 'Wheelerisms' and an\narticle about himself.\nMr. Jarman has been more successful.\nHis name appears thirty times, and often\nin 'big-print'. He too has managed to\nget his photograph and a facetious article about himself printed.\nMr. Irving ought to know that the\nEditorial is not a vehicle for his fas-ois t political views (Ioan only hope\nthat he was trying to be humorous),\nwhile his attack on Professor Blackett\nis degrading and fanatical.\nThe selection of Reotorial Wheelerisms was in extreme bad-taste.\nNo attempt has been made to collect\nor encourage literary material from\nstudents of the College, and the hundreds of freshmen probably still have no\nidea that this is also their magazine.\nWhy have they not been approached?\nI feel that the present editorial\npolicy o an only result in a decline of\nthe sales, and give both students and\noutsiders a false and lowering impression\nof what I.C. is o ap able of doing.\nTours truly,\nPeter Clark.\n.\nAccess to Booksfor Science Examinees\nLord Verulam said at the Oxford\nconference for schoolmasters on Jan.\n7th that candidates sitting examinations\nin the science should have access to\nbooks during the examination, at any rate\nin the more advanced subjects* Such K examinations should be held in libraries\nor within easy reach of them.\nDea- Sir,\nI wish to protest, as we all should, against the ton* and content\nof the editorial of the last issue of\nPhoenix. Whether the editor meant\nhi a words to be taken seriously or not,\nthe Fascist dogma contained in thi3 editorial is inexcusable. I may add that\nif he did not intend it seriously I think\nhis sense of humour deplorable.\nNo doubt Mr. Irving has the right\nto express his political views but should\nhe have the right to express them in the\nCollege Magazine? The distribution of\npolitical material within the Union is\nforbidden,as Mr. Irving well knows.\nSurely then, it should also be forbidden\nin the Phoenix.which is financed by and\nwidely circulated among members of the\nUnion.\nIn noting the glaring untruths and\nmisconceptions which could only have\nstemmed from an ill-informed (or dare I say uneducated?) mind I have to assume\nthat the editor is sublimely happy, for\nas he himself says,\"Ignoranoe is Bliss\",\nI also feel that crit io isra and\nattacks on persons well known in I.C. are more appropriate in the \"Confid-ent i al* magazine than in a literary\npublication of College Students (or\nshould it be \"several\" College students?)\nYours sincerely,\nP.N. Potter.\nPAUL ROBESON\nAT\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nLast term Imperial College was\nhonoured by a visit from Paul Robeson,\nas part of his European Tour. A guest of the Indian Society, he warned\na packed and expectant Ayrton Hall that\nthis was neither a funeral nor a serious recital - \"Relax\" was his\nmessage at this point, and relax the\naudie no e did, under the influence of\nthe songs with which he opened the\nproceedings.\nSome critics in this country claim\nthat Time has robbed Paul Robeson's voice of some of its volume; true or\nnot, the new rich mellowness that is\nhere combined with the old Robeson control and sensitive feeling, gave us a vocal instrument of astonishing\nemotional impact.\nThe major part of his visit was\noccupied in a \"conversation\" with his\nhearers on a wide range of topics -from tonal languages and jazz rhythm ns, and the debt in this connection that\nthe New World owes the Old, and thus\nback to peace and international co-operation. Although generally anti-American, there was no stated political\nbias to all this - an attempt from the\nfloor to involve him in an \"East\nversus West\" controversy was, in fact,\nsuppressed by other members of the\naudience.\nFacts Figures and the Future of the\nPhoenix\n* We are printing 2000 copies of\nSPRING PHOENIX, almost double the\n1957 circulation.\n\u2022 We have not touched the Union Subsidy since the present editorial team\nteam took over.\nx We are sub sidi sing the mailing of\nJ00 copies to all the British public\nSchools and selected boy's grammar\nschools out of Phoenix profits.\n\u2022 Thanks to the efforts of an extremely efficient sales staff, we now sell\nmore copies of our magazine than does\nany other College magazine in the Unitec\nKingdom.\n> Kind's College magazine LUCIFER sells\n500-600 copies in a College of 2,^.00\nstudents\nI THINK THAT THESE FACTS SPEAK FOR\nTHEMSELVES.\nDavid J. Irving, EDITOR\n\u2022\nFELIX COMMENT\n\"The policy of a College magazine is a very difficult thing to define in det-ail. Unlike most other periodicals the\npurpose of such a magazine is not to\nreflect the outlook of the editor and\nthe editorial staff, although no doubt\nin minor details the magazine will owe\nsomething to the idiosyncrasies of\nthese individuals.\"\nFrom the Editorial of Phoenix Oat 1925\nIn an Ayrton Hall filled with\nstudents whose countries feel so strongly about the questions of independence\nand self-determination, Mr. Robeson's message was very well received. Later,\nhowever, some of the European members\nof this audience - and there were not\nso very many - expressed a sense of\ndisappointment. Perhaps \"anti-cli-max\" is the better term. For,\nalthough no one can but admire and\nrespect Paul Robeson the singer and\nactor, Paul Robeson the diplomat and\npeacemaker does not ring so true -his please for \"Peace\" was almost,\nan a polo get io intrusion into hi a con-versa tion, too artificial to affect\nemotionally. Perhaps European reserve ha3 something to do with this\nimpression, for it is all too easy to\ncompare Schweitzer with Robeson, as\ntwo musicians serving the world for\nother causes.\nIt seems that the emotional appeal (or \"publicity value\"?) of curing\na few hundred unfortunate natives is much lower than Mr. Robeson's.

W.S.C. established a good lead\nat the end of the first lap, and continued to increase this to give a decisive\nwin.\nThe visit to Delft was also something of a social occasion, and the I.C. girls paid a visit to k he Delft pottery\nfactory, to Amsterdam and Roterdam\nbefore they left.\nOne can only hope that this\nexcellent performance in Holland will\nencourage some more I. C.W. Arians to be\na little less shy about Joining in the\nactivities of I.C. W.S.C. The Imperial College Union\ngreatly regrets the deaths\nOf two of its members - both'\njust before Christmas.\nThey were Ray Gibbons (ex\nR.S.

    "content": "FELIX3 SIX EXPEDITIONS FROM I.C. IN19591_3 The prophets of doom who 3 it, pen3 raised, waiting to write the obituary of\nI.C., must he sadly disappointed in the enthusiastic activities resulting in the\nvarious expeditions wh i oh leave this country with the participation of Imperial\nstudents and the hacking of the Exploration Board.\nFollowing on the scientific expeditions, to Ghana, Iceland and Norway, there\nare 6 proposed for this. Two will visit South America, one to the Azores,one to\nJugoslavia, one to Iceland and the sixth to Jan Mayen Land.\nAPOLOBAMBA\nFormerly known as the Peru\nExpedition it is almost a year since\nthe first idea was born. Since this\ntime sufficient support has bean forthcoming to put this expedition on a \u2022\nsound working and financial basis.\nThe initial support from the I.C. Exploration Board was \u00a3500, followed by\na second grant also of \u00a3500. Support\nhas also been received from the Mount\nEverest Foundation, the Royal Geographical Sooiety and from the Bolivian\nAndino Club.\nThe mountain area to be visited\nis on the borders of Bolivia and Peru,\ncalled the Nudo de Apolobamba ranging\nfrom 16,000 to 20,000 ft. Felix announced the members of the\nexpedition when they were selected early\nin the first term of this year. Under\nthe leadership of Dr. Geoff. Bratt (now\nwith Eric Shiptan in Patagonia), the team\nis as follows:\na Bill Melbourne (Aero P.G, John Jenkinson l Chem. Eng.\nTony Ewart (Mining Geology P.G.) Arthur Smith (3rd Yr. Mining Geo)\nPaul Garrard (2nd Yr. Geology)\nThe aim of the expedition is to\nexplore and map the Bolivian part of\nthe mountain range, oar ry out a geological survey of a slightly larger area\nto join up with previous work, and to\nclimb the Soral Peaks which are on the\nBolivian side. The approach will be\nfrom La Paz in Bolivia, initially by\ntruck and then it is hoped to be able\nto set up a base camp after several days\nmarch with a mule team and porters.\nICELAND\nAlthough not officially an individual expedition but an extension of\nwork carried on in I.e., this party\nhas also applied far support, but not\nfinancial aid from the Exploration\nBoard.\nThe Party will be mapping a vol-o anic area and carrying on the work\nbegun by previous expeditions (1956 and\n1958) and by Dr. Walker of this College.\nThe three members will be:\nR. Edwards\nG. Borsley (Mrs.) ) II Geology\nC. Blake )\nJUGOSLAVIA\nNext July an expedition will spend\ntwo months near Dubrovnik on the Adriatlol\nCoast of Jugoslavia. As the party is a mixture of several Departments and\nYears it intends to carry out general\nfloral, faunal and geological surveys\nof the region. Several ecological\nproblems will be attempted and a collection of plant material will be made for\nthe Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew as well\nas for the College Herbarium.\nThe party wil loons is t of the\nfollowing 10 people:-Botany HM. Stuart )\nC.L. Ryan\nMiss H.C. Tompsett\nA.B. Snioer\nMiss S. Burbedge )\nR.G. Stickland)\nMiss M. Woodbum Botany HIP. Chen Zoology HC. Welch Zoology IG. Hawkins Geology II\nThis is the first I.C. expedition\nto visit a Communist country and they\nwould be grateful far any helpful\nadv ioe or first hand knowledge of\nJugoslavian conditions.\nBRITISH GUIANA\nThe organization of this expedition\nwas started during October of Last year\nwith the main aim of bringing back\nrecordings of tropical animals. These\nwill be both sound recordings, using\nbattery tape-machines, and visual records\nby means of a colour cine film The\ntwo will be later superimposed to give\na sound-track to the film.\nBritish Guiana was chosen as being\none of the nearer tropical regions under\nBritish control and i3 an area about\nwhich very little is really known.\nThere will be 3 members in the\nparty - M.R. Honer, J.R. Pamell and\nJ.C. Taylor - all third year zoologists.\nTheir destination is Imbaimadai on the\nupper reaches of the Mazaruni River and\nit is hoped that the expedition will occupy a total of about 3 months.\nThe Exploration Board has provided\na grant of \u00a3100, and the B.B.C. seems\nwilling to provide equipment and advice.\nAZORES\nThe application of the 1.0. Underwater Cub to the Exploration Board for\nsupport for its plans to visit the Azores\nthis sumner was successful.\nAs well as approval of the exp edi tion, the Board gave a grant of \u00a3600.\nUnder the leadership of N.0. Crossland, Zoology III, a team of divers\nwill make a general collection of the\nmarine fauna near the island of Terceira.\nThe expedition has been fortunate in\nthat, the U.S.A.F. maintain a base on\nthis island and have offered daily\nsupplies of compressed air for the expeditions aqualung s. Underwater photography will be an\nimportant part of the work with an\nofficial expedition photo gra^ ner, al though most of the party will have their\nown cameras. Thanks to a loan from the\nRoyal Geographical Society of the\nnecessary equipment, it is hoped to make\na cine film of the expedition.\nMany marine biological institutes\nand museums have already shown great\ninterest in the expedition and are\nhelping as much as possible with advice\nand equipment. The Portuguese authorities concerned with the Azores are\nbeing most helpful to the Expedition.\nThe party will consist of :-- H.0. Crossland,\n(Miss) CM. Brookes,\nA. Berryman,\nR.H. T. Gamett,\nW.M. J. Paskin,\nD. Lamberth,\nD. Grey,\nA. Larkin, and another member yet to be;\nchosen.\nJAN MAYEN\nThis is another expedition which\nhas applied to the Exploration Board\nfor approval of its plans. It is\nintended to visit the island during the\nsummer to continue some of the work\ndone during the 1938 expedition.\nUnfortunately the remote position of the\nisland ha3 caused transport difficulties,,\nbut the members of the expedition are\nhoping for the best.\n\n"

    "content": "EDITED BY K.W. LUDLAM.\nSOCCER The first mato hs s of the Spring\nTerm were played on Saturday, Jan 10th and a very promising 3tart to the year\nwas made with all teams recording a win.\nThe l3t XI, playing very we j_i, heat Finchley 'A'31 on a hard frozen\npitch at Harlington, After being a goal in arrears at half-time, three fine\ngoal3 by Coups, after some good approach\nwork, finally clinched the i3* sue.\nThe Znd. and 3rd XI's playing well\non form, beat Battersea I and Polytechnic Strollers 3-2 and 3-0 respect-iv ely. Not to be outdone in any way,\nthe 6th and 7 th XI*s kept up the day's ran by defeating Chelsea II and B.B.C. V teams respectively.\nThis Saturday the first three teams\ntravel to Cambridge to play Christs I and II and Emmanuel College II, where a very entertaining day i3 anticipated.\nSAILING\nThe Autumn term, a term to be remembered as a term with an almost complete\nabsence of wind,, ended with three I.C. boats being well placed in the Winter\nSeries of intercollegiate races for the\nKacPherson Trophy, 1,0. boats being\n1st.,2 nd., and 5th. out of 40 boats.\nThe helmsmen responsible for this\nare Janisz Wilezynski, Graham Taylor\nand Colin French.\nDuring the vacation two I.C. boats\nvisited the Royal Lymington Yacht Club\nfor the Christmas Open Meeting, where\nFireflies competed for the \"Twins\nCup\". After some very interesting sai ling in fresh win fs the Cup was won by\nGraham Taylor of I.C., the other College\nhe lsm an John Welsh - finishing 5th, RIDING\nFresh spirit and interest has been\ninfused into the club since last session.\nSeveral new members of a high standard\nof horsemanship joined us last term,\nand beginners attended courses at Hill oo te, Coombe Hill, and the Civil Service\nRiding Schools. Two day rides were\nheld in the Chiltem Hills , and were\ngreatly enjoyed. No mishaps occurred\non these outings apart from after-effects\nmarked by a tendency of some members to\nremain standing on all possible occasions for several days after.\nSocial events included two coffee\nevenings in conjunction with Bedford\nCollege Riding Club at which films on\nhorsemanship were 3how n; and a very\nsuccessful hop. At the latter event,\na remarkable quadruped containing two\nbudding explorers made' its appearance,\nand many people put it down to the\neffects of drinking the beer provided\nin the Nags Head, alias the Upper Refectory.\nThe club is hoping to organise a summer trek in the Highlands, and new\nmembers will be welcomed to all our\nactivities.\nSWIMMING With the term but a few days old,\nthe Polo section can report 3 victories and a dra.? to its credit; the\nonly disappointment being the failure\nof the first team to beat Battersea in\nthe first League match of the season,\nthe result being a44 draw. However\nthe second team gained ample revenge\nover this slight by hammering Battersea II in thier first League Div.III\nmatch by 10-2. Hills being congratulated on getting a fine nap hand.\nIn friendly fixtures, the third team\nscored a resounding 6-1 victory over\nWestminster College, and the seo on d team\nfollowed this up by a30 defeat of\nNorthern Poly. Despite these successes\nthe Club has 3 till need of the ser v loe s of a goalkeeper for me of the lower\nteams; could anybody interested please\ncontact the skipper 7i a the Union Rack.\nThe last Wednesday of last terra\nsaw the Mines win the Linstead Swimming\ncup for the first time in its history.\nThe gala held at U.L. U. pool for the\nfir3 t time, was an outstanding success,\nand with Mines supporters, who outnumbered the Guilds and R.C.S. contingent by about 10-1, literally cheering\ntheir team to victory. The Polo Cup\nwas won by Guilds, after a series of\nclose hard-fought games.\nMINES A TULU The President and a large proportion\nof the Royal School of Mines Union paid\ntheir first official visit to the U.L. Union to support the Mines' Swimming\nTeam in the Inter-Collegiate Gala. The\nRSM team won the swimming events quite\no on vi j iV'-in cj lv by 22 points, to the 17\nof Guilds, ana the 13 of RCS. Don Shorey\nwon both the 100 metres freestyle and\nbutterfly, and the team won both of the\nrelays.\nIn the water polo Mines were unfortunate in being drawn to play SCS first,\nand Immediately afterwards to play Guilds.\nThey won the first, and then lost to\nGuilds. RCS then drew their match with\nGuilds, and so the latter were the victors.\nFart of the Mines' victory could be\nattributed to the moral support given by\nthe crowd of 70 Minesmen lining one side\nof the pool, with Hitch in their midst.\nThere were three supporters from RCS, and\none from Guilds.\nAfter the Gala the crowd retired to\nthe ULU Bar, which they promptly livened\nup. The Editor of Sennet and some of his\nstaff were there too, and following his\nremarks about the Vets singing in the\nBar, he was threatened with de bagging. Rather than face this ignominy he retired\nCwith his staff) to a small room behind\nthe actual bar, from which he did not\nescape until the crowd left.\nAs ladies were present the songs did\nnot perhaps reach the usual high standard\nof the IC Bar, but nevertheless a rowdy\nevening was had by all before they\nretired to the seclusion of our own\nlicenced premises.\nCROSSCOUNTRY. On Sat. 6th Dec. I.C. retained\nthe U.L. cross-country championship\nfor the third successive year. In a field of 134 &11 the major positions\nfrom the third to 134 were taken by the\nhi\\~e entry of I.C. runners. The second\nteam beat the Kings' and Q. k'.C. first\nteams to take a well merited' fifth place,\nonly too other Colleges ran second teams,\nwhereas I.C. entered and finished six\nteams. The I.C. results were:-l st Team: J. Collins 3rd, D. Briggs 5th, A. Larkum 6th, A Brown\n14th, J. Jaeger 21st.2 nd Team: 0. Gilbert 15th, J. Bernard 18th, P. Rayment 39th, G.1 'anson 41st,15.

    "content": "FELIX MINES BALL This year's Mines Ball was held\nlater in the tern than usual, on the\nlast day of ten in fact,and provided\na very ple sant finale to -what had\nbecome for some an mr increasing\nround of parties.\nAa usual, the Ball was vary wall\norganised, and the demand for tickets\nwas such that all unsold ones were\ncalled in a week before the Ball took\nplace, and the subsequent black market\nin spare tickets reached astronomical\nproportions (on* ticket holder was\noffered \u00a33). The Mines Entertainment\nOfficer, Alan Lewis, in a exclusive\ninterview, stated that approximately .\n30 tickets were sold above last year's total, and expressed the hope that the\nConcert Hall would not be too crowded.\nIn the event, the hall was full but\nnot overcrowded, and everyone had a very pleasant time.\nAs a change from dancing, there\nwaa a cabaret featuring Messrs. John\nLooae and Thorn. King, accompanied by\nAlan Lewis on piano and a musical sketch,\nagain by Alan Lewis and his wife.\nThere were a series of commercials in\nwhich Graham King figured as a high-pressure salesman of various dubious\nproducts. (it was pointed out to\nR.C.S. President Peter Kassler that not\none dubious joke was included -fortunately, he took the remark the\nright way).\nThe official band left at 3 a.m. an hour later than last year, and the\nJazm Band took over when the proceedings warmed up somewhat.\nMr. Lewis and his helpers should\nbe congratulated on providing a fitting\noli max to the Christmas term. What\nwas only a few years ago almost exclusively a Ball for Miners is new a Ball\norganised l jy_ Mines for I.C. This Ball also saw positively\nthe last official appearance of Denis\nLeston - in his favourite role of j az s pianist - an appear an oe which terminated\naround 6.30 in the morning, as with\nundiminished fer v our he improvised to\nan empty Hall. \"Even geniuses must\nsleep\" was verified - even Denis had,\nat last, to snatch a little rest.\nThus pas seth an era.\nTHE CHRISTMAS ISLANDERS\nThe Christmas Islanders are not\nhalf so remote as you might imagine.\nThey are really of this world and will finitely meat at 5.15 p.m. in the\nCommittee Room off Jhe Lower Union\nLounge on the following Fridays:\nJanuary 16th, when Tony Brookes will chat about Shakespearean J ass; January 30th, when an informal symposium\non The Short Story will be introduced\nby Peter Jarman and February 13th, when a similar informal symposium will\nbe held on Why do Scientists especially\nappreciate Music? This will be introduced by George Ripka. An advanced\nwarning: if sufficient members have\nroad the book, it is hoped to discuss\nBoris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago on March\n13th. STUDENT SERVICES\nOn Sunday, January 18th, at\n9.30 a.m., the Bishop of Kensington\nwill oe leb rate Holy Communion in Holy\nTrinity Church, next door to the Union.\nThis service is intended to meet the\nrequirements of students in West London, and in particular - students at\nImperial College. This will, in fact,\ninaugurate are g it \u2022\n* series of services\non \u00abn Sundays du. ; term at this time,\nthanks to the kindness of Rev. Cleverley Ford and his Parochial Church\nCouncil.\nWe hope all members of the Church\nof Kngland in the College, both students and staff, will support the Chaplaincy in this new venture. The ser-vio e is intended not only for those\nresident nearby but also for all those\nin lodgings who have no real a ff ili ation to any local chur oh and there are\nmany such people here. Breakfast will\nbe available afterwards in Queen Alexandra's House, opposite the Union.\nWe trust that we will see many of\nyou at this first celebration. Further\ndetails may be obtained from the Acting\nChairman of the Secretary of the Church\nSociety.\nN.W.F. Lee3 (Chem.E.H) K.C. Moss (Chem.IH)\nMOUNTAINEERING CLUB Three independent parties held\nmeets in Scotland this Christmas, two\nrepresenting the Mountaineering Club,\nand the other was- a training trip for\nfour members of the forthcoming Peru\nExpedition.\nThe party arrived at Braemar, via\nthe Lake District, on Boxing Day. The\nmarch up into the Cairngorms was started\nthat evening owing to fine weather and\na full moon, but was halted for the\nnight still some five miles from Loch\nEtchachan, Ben Macdui, the props ed destination, by a snow fall which continued\nfor some twelve hours. However, Loch\nEtchachan was finally reached, the\nweather having deteriorated by this time\nto a blizzard, this affording good\npractice for pitching tents in high wind\nand thick snow. After three days of\ncontinuous blizzard, it was decided to\nreturn to Braemar, where all clothing\nand equipment might be thawed and dried\nout. The return was eventually achieved\nafter an eight hour march, in places\nthrough waist deep snow. New Years Eve\nwas duly celebrated in the traditional\nmanner, and the party moved to Glencoe\nin the hope of better weather and a little climbing. Fortunately, this\nproved the case, and made an excellent\nconclusion to the meet, which should\nprove invaluable experience in the\nAndes this summer.\nThe latter party had intended to\nspend just over a week in practicing\nhigh level camping and snow and ice\nclimbing in the Cairngorms, this area\nbeing chosen as that having the most\nextreme conditions of weather during\nthis time of year. This was certainly\nthe case!\nCOMING EVENTS Tuesday 27th January\nGeneral Studies: \"Britain since 1851:\nThe Britain of Churchill and Attlee\",\nby A. J. Taylor.\n\"The Origin of Species\", by A.C.

Woolwich Poly I, the only team to have\nbeaten I.C.I are expected to win\nthe League and Cup. I.C.I have also\nreached the 3emi final of the Cup.\nThe remaining teams have had a poor season\nCOOPER A TlON.\nIt would hardly seem to be necessary\nto remind dubs and Teams that it is undoubtedly in their own interests to\nkeep their followers informed and up\nto date with their fortunes.\nSometimes, however, it is necessary\nto bully and badger Club off joints or\nmembers before any sort of report is in fact handed in. These reports are\nnot a test of English - they need only\nbe a straightforward account of your\nteam or Club's progress lino e the last\nedition of Felix came out.\nSurely such cooperation would be to\nthe benefit of both parties - so why\nnot write, no matter how little or how\nmuch 1\n\n"
