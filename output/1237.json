    "content": "music reviews\nLIVE: The White Stripes + The\nDirtbombs @ Shepherds Bush\nForget what you think you know about The White Stripes, (pic\nabove) The Strokes et al. If these bands are the saviours of rock,\nsent to earth to defend us from the onslaught of shite pop\nmusic, then The Dirtbombs have come to save them from the\ninevitable slide into mediocrity.\nTonight, the five-piece from Detroit (including two drummers)\nplay a45 minute set which is a re-education in rock 'n' roll and\nthe best show this correspondent has ever seen. The drum kit\nfalls off the platform, and they play on. The drum kit falls apart,\nand they play on.\nWithin the first five (fantastic) songs, the lead guitarist\nthrows every rock star pose imaginable and comes over to join\nthe crowd. The band quite blatantly enjoy themselves, and this\nfeeling passes to the audience. They play amazing rock, roll,\nfunk and blues. They love it, and so does the crowd. They also\nhave the cutest tambourine player since, well, a long time ago.\nIf you see one band in the next year, make it this one. If you\nbuy one album in the next year, make it theirs. You owe it to\nyourself and to the world to make this band HUGE. Open your\nmind. Be educated.\nHaving said that, The White Stripes were amazing. Jack White\nhas more stage presence than it should be legally possible to\npossess, and he is the only man in the world who can sing like\nDavid Beckham on helium and still be totally cool.\nTonight, they play louder and harder than ever. Kicking off\nwith Dead Leaves and The Dirty Ground, Jack immediately has\nthe crowd right where he wants them. Fell in Love With a Girl\nand Hotel Yorba produce scenes of mass chorus yelling and\npo going. Meg looks on in a daze as Jack loses it to the music,\ncompletely engrossed in his own little rock world. They play\neverything the crowd could want, plus some new stuff which\nsounds very promising indeed. Right now, they are one of the\nbest acts in the world. Catch them if you can.\nBBBB B Dominic\nOUT THIS WEEK\nThe following are due out on Monday 27 May:\nALBUMS CKY - Volume 1\nTETRA SPLENDOUR - Splendid Animation\nSINGLES\nAMERICAN HEAD CHARGE Just So You Know\nGARLIC - Not Over Yet\nGERLING - Dust Me Selecta\nMISS BLACK AMERICA Talk Hard\nSAHARA HOTNIGHTS - With Or Without Control\nSIX BY SEVEN All My New Best Friends\nVINETTE - Lost In Berlin\nSingles\nRoundup\nVINETTE - Lost In Berlin\nSpanish guitars and slinky beats draw you into the world of\nVinette. When Lost In Berlin, she brings gospel, swing, soul and\nR&B to the feet of the listener, with her rich and alluring vocals.\nHowever, the lyrics let the show down, together with the predictable tempo changes and overall impression of a Eurovision\nentry from one of those mid-table nations.\nBBQOQ Sajini\nGEMMA HAYES Hanging Around The single itself sounds a lot like PJ Harvey, with the same\nflowing vocals and rhythms. It's reasonable, but clearly not\nwhat Gemma Hayes does best - the B sides are where the real\nquality lies, with pretty, sleepy tunes. The guitars lull, the voice\nhaunts, and altogether it's all really rather nice.\nBBBB O Jamie\nDJ SHADOW You Can't Go Home Again\nThe A side of this will probably surprise and confuse you, but\nwhen you get used to the weird eighties bass, guitar and synth\nand give it a chance, this proves to be an excellent return to the\nstudio. After a long Royksopp-esque beginning, it builds to a superb breakbeat climax, but then you'd expect nothing less.\nBBBB B Nick\nDJ SHADOW COMPETITION!\nWe've got FIVE exclusive DJ Shadow mix CDs to give away.\nEach contains five selections from his forthcoming album The\nPrivate Press.\nQUESTION: What is the name of DJ Shadow's groundbreaking debut album?\n(a) Endtroducing (b) Leftism (c) Fat Of The Land\nPlease email your answer, along with your name, year and\ndepartment, to music.felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday 30 May.\n\n"

    "content": "Pollock\nportrait of a drunk\nStarring Ed Harris, directed by Ed Harris, a movie about one\nof the twentieth century's most influential artists.\nAbstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock was in the\nfifties the most famous artist in the world. His paint by dripping\ntechnique had rocked the art e stab ish ment and today his work\nis worth millions. His unhappy personal life, alcoholism, and\npremature death in a car crash also contributed to his legendary\nstatus.\nPollock paints a brutal and depressing picture of a flawed\ngenius who sought re cog niton and at the same time stayed true\nto his art. Jackson Pollock is the archetypal artist. Unhappy,\ntemperamental, arrogant, and at the same time a perfectionist,\na devotee to his work. However, the inner conflict which is the\nsource of artistic inspiration lead in Pollock's case to an eventual and somewhat inevitable self-destruction.\nThe opening scenes of this biopic have Pollock, wasted,\nclimbing up the stairs loudly shouting, \"fuck Picasso, fuck\nPicasso!\" This sets the trend for the rest of the movie. It alternates between periods where Pollock is out of control, drunk,\nand abusing his wife, Lee Krasner (oscar nominated Marcia Gay\nHarden), and moments where he is in his element, frenetically\npainting in an almost trance-like mania.\nThis movie is not about Pollock the artist. It is about Pollock\nthe man. Who was an artist. So strictly speaking it was about\nPollock the artist. But the two are inseparable and it is on that\npoint of fact that this movie slips up. The script touches upon\nmany themes in the artist's life but fails to give us any real\ninsight into what was going on inside Pollock's mind. The conflicts are self-evident but it is hard to relate to them and by the\nend of the film Pollock remains a distant individual.\nEd Harris' oscar nominated performance is a brilliant example\nof method acting. Previously to this, I had recently seen\nGlengarry Glen Ross (1992), where Harris managed to shine in\none of the the greatest acting ensembles ever lined-up. But\nHarris' performance in Pollock easily the highlight of his career.\nSo if you are sick of science here is a chance to see for yourself\nwhat it is like to be a troubled artist.\nDariUS Star Wars: Episode IIAttack of the Clones\nFirst of all, I would just like to say, and I don't know if you\nagree with me, that Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom\nMenace was an absolute disgrace.\nIt was pitiful. Too much politics and tax-dodging and not\nenough wars in the stars. So before watching Star Wars:\nEpisode II - Attack Of The Clones, I was still tut-tutti ng about\nhow bad Episode I was, and quite frankly I was anticipating\nmore of the same.\nAnother factor that put Attack Of The Clones at a preconceived disadvantage was a movie by the name of LotR: The\nFellowship Of The Ring. Peter Jackson's epic was so good that\nEpisode II had its work cut out already in making an impression\non me. Subconsciously, my judgement of the new Star Wars\nmovie would be the outcome of a direct comparison with the\nexcellent Lord Of The Rings movie.\nEpisode II is set ten years after The Phantom Menace attack\non the planet Naboo. After an attempt on Senator Padme\nAmidala's( Natalie Portman) life, Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan\nMcGregor) and his pupil Anakin Skywalker (Hayden\nChristensen) are sent to find the assassin. They discover that all\nis not what it seems, and soon, an inter-galactic political conspiracy involving an army of clones, a bounty hunter called\nJango Fett, and a Sith Lord begins to unravel itself.\nThe story line, despite looking good on paper, is very predictable and, despite one twist, sticks to classic Hollyood for-mula. What I found more interesting were the characters and\nthe in-jokes, especially, when Obi-Wan Kenobi, almost sarcastically says to Jar-Jar Binks, \"it's great to see you back.\"\nFortunately, Jar-Jar does not feature heavily, but we have much\nmore of Yoda, who actually flexes his light-sabre muscles in a memorable fight.\nEpisode II is better than Episode I. But not, in my mind, in the\nsame league as the original trilogy. The visuals are generally\nastounding, (although CG is overused) the acting is good, and\nthe plot at least held my attention. But the highlight was the\nJohn Williams soundtrack which really took me back to the\ngood old days.\n0 0 0 0 n Alfonso Parelli\n\n"

    "content": "club active\nIC Boat Club\nThe 23rd of March saw excellent results at the Head of the\nRiver for the Imperial College\nboat club: the first eight finished 3rd, the seconds 9th, the\nthirds 24th, the fourths 73rd and the novices 96th overall.\nIn comparison, Brookes finished 2nd,12 th,37 th,118 th and 231st, and UL finished\n18th and 31st with their only\ntwo crews. As you can see\nfrom these results we were\ncomfortably the best university overall, and were also the\nsecond best club in the co un try, behind Leander.\nThe next event was supposed to be BUSA, but unfortunately racing on the second\nday where our top crews were\nentered was cancelled due to\nhigh winds. On the first day\nour women's squad were in\naction, but a combination of a crab and lack of time between\nraces unfortunately resulted in\nno medals. However over the\nlast two weekends we were\nable to race, starting at\nWallingford regatta. Here our\nelite eights came second and\nthird, just losing to a stacked\nMolesey crew with numerous\ninternational oarsmen, and the\ngirls came second in both senior 2 and senior 3 cox ed fours\nto Kingston, who are fast\nbecoming our arch n vals. This last weekend saw IC\ndivide and conquer, with some\ngoing to Bedford regatta, some\nto Bourne at Chiswick Bridge\nregatta and one eight venturing across the channel to race\nin Valenciennes, a new venture for the club.\nAt Bedford there was an all\nIC final in the Senior 1 cox ed fours, while the winners of\nthat race were denied a win in\nthe elite cox ed fours as a result of a clash with their\nopposition who refused to re-row after our complaints.\nBourne at Chwick Bridge\nresulted in an excellent win in\nthe Womens' Novice double\nsculls. Meanwhile in France,\non arrival in Valenciennes we\nwent for a short practice paddle before going to the hotel\nthat our hosts had kindly paid\nfor. In the evening there was a reception at the town hall with\nthe Mayor, which unfortunately was largely incomprehensible due to our poor French.\nThis did however give us a chance to meet the\nManchester University crew\nfor the first time, who had\nchallenged us for our long-held top spot in the University\nTest Match Result\nThe first test between\nEngland and Sri Lanka ended\nin a draw at Lords on Monday.\nIn recording their highest\nscore in sixty years of 529/5\ndec, England managed to\nsave a match in which they\nhad earlier followed on. After\nscoring only 275 in response\nto Sri Lanka's impressive\n555/8 dec. in the first innings,\nthe chances of an England collapse and an innings defeat\nwere high. These fears were\nunfounded after a second\ninnings opening partnership\nof 168 by Marcus Trescothick\nand Michael Vaughan. This\nwas followed by solid batting\nperformances by Mark\nButcher, Nasser Hussam and\nGraham Thorpe, which made\nthe result of a draw on the\nfinal day the most likely out-come.\nThe second test (of three)\nstarts on the 30th May at\nEdgbaston.\nRowing League\n(www.row league. com).\nThe next day saw the actual\nracing with a3500m time trial\nto decide who would go\nthrough into the 1000m multi-lane final. The time trial went\nwell with our crew holding\ntheir form well and rating 37\nfor the entire course. Our timing of the race gave us 10 minutes and 20 seconds, but the\nofficials gave us a time of 13\nminutes and 40 seconds, putting us behind the home team!\nHowever we didn't complain\ntoo strongly as we were still in\nthe final along with\nValencienes, Dresden, Delft,\nWestminster School, Skoll and\nManchester.\nAfter a long afternoon of\nrelaxing we boated for the\nfinal (which was the last race\nof the day) in confident mood.\nA slightly shaky start meant\nthat we didn't lead from the\nfirst stroke, but by 250m it was\nclear that it was only between\nus and Dresden for the gold,\nwith both crews level.\nHowever by 500m we were a quarter of a length up on\nDresden and this was where\nwe really settled into our\nrhythm at 39 strokes per\nminute. At this point the rest\nof the field went backwards as\nwe accelerated into the final\nstages and we won by an\nextremely comfortable 7 seconds by the finish, recording 2\nminutes and 48 seconds for\nthe 1000m course.\nThe boat club is still\nextremely active, despite\nexams, and is really looking\nforward to racing at Womens'\nHenley and Henley Royal\nRegatta.\nr Student Activities\nAssistant\nImperial College Union has a vacancy for a part-time\nAssistant (36 weeks term-time only, 10:30am6:30p mM F) to provide support to the Student Activities Coordinator in the organisation of student development\nand training, clubs and societies support, maintaining\nadministrative information, audio visual and office\nequipment upkeep and liaison with sports staff,\ndepartments and facilities.\nThe successful applicant must have some work experience dealing with customers or clients, good\ncommunication skills, IT technical experience, good\norganisational skills and be an outgoing self-starter who enjoys working in a lively, student centred environment.\nLiteracy and numeracy essential.

    "content": "Balance Of Power\nDear Felix,\nHaving read last week's \"Israeli\nresponse\", I regret not having written to\npraise the courage of people like Dr\nSahibzada, acting like human shields. I don't want to do a reply to their letters\n(although to lament that \"taxpayers'\nmoney\" goes to finance the \" UN emergency refugee agency\", when $3 billion a year goes to Israel, with wagon loads of\nUS/UK weapons, is particularly heart-less). Of course I'm no anti-semite, actually I think the Israel state is a great\nachievement! But I 've (slowly) realised\nhow unbalanced the middle-eastern conflict was. Perhaps we should look at UN Security Council resolution (you know,\nthat international body...), that, in\nOctober 2000 was \"call[ing] on Israel, the\noccupying power, to abide scrupulously\nby its legal obligations.\" Similar international decisions, calling for respect of\npeace treaties and respect of the Geneva\nconventions (duh?) are regularly vetoed\nby the US (since 1976), eliminating them\nfrom mainstream debate. Israel (the\n\"peaceful\" state that pulled out of Egypt\nand Lebanon only 20 years ago) has the\nbenefit of affording PR and lobbying, and\nit shows. The death count goes on (simi-la rly un-balanced), and \"an eye for an eye\nmakes the whole world blind...\"\nWell, that almost made me forget about\nthe US DoD/ \" a private company\" develop ping potential biological weapons (bot-ulis m) inside IC!\nMatthew C Francis Go Home\nDear Felix,\nWhy won't Francis go away? No-one\nreally cared when the election was on,\nand those who did voted no. Is this such\na difficult concept to grasp? Surely he has\nbetter things to do than continue a crusade that was essentially flawed from the\nstart. And surely Felix isn't your personal\nforum for continually trying to make your\npoint. I 'll go now before I start swearing,\nand will has to censor me.\nIain Angus\nIn Search Of Moderation\nI 've been following the highly emotive\ndebate that's been occur mg in the pages\nof this august organ re: the IsraelPalestine conflict for some time now, and\nhave noticed that most of the correspondents so far have had pretty extreme\nviews on one side or the other. No doubt-they themselves don't think so and needless to say, I think that my own views are\npeculiarly moderate, too. You may dis-agree.\nI have problems with arguments that\ndemon is e the Palestinians universally as\nterrorists. I also have problems with much\nof the criticism of Israel we hear in our\nmedia; Britain has a long, disgrace ul history of anti-Semitism and I fear that much\nof the anti-Israeli sentiment expressed\nunder a pro-Palestinian, social justice flag\nis in fact motivated by this ugly tendency.\nI personally feel that much of the Israeli\nmilitary and political man ou ve ring recently has been despicable, but then so\nhave the horrific tactics of the Palestinian\nfreedom-fighters, rallying to the call of the\nIntefada.\nThe striking thing about listening to\npeople from both sides is their willingness to talk about atrocities per pert rated against them in the past, in stark contrast\nto their unwillingness to consider what\nmay happen in the future; Israeli incursions are not plausible attempts to prevent future suicide bombings - they are\nquite transparent attempts to punish the\nPalestinian population for giving succ our to Israel's enemies. Members of Hamas\nand the Al-Aqsa Brigades do not believe\nthat blowing themselves up in crowded\nIsraeli streets will bring about destruction of the whole Israeli state; they too are\nmerely exacting an ill-targeted revenge\nfor past wrongs. In Ireland we had a name for such depressing spirals; we\ncalled them \"tit-for-tat violence\" and it\nwas widely recognised that while such\nmindless thug ger y persisted, chances for\npeaceful co-existence of the two populations were remote.\nHowever, supporters of Israel will tell\nyou that the Middle East isn't like\nNorthern Ireland - the Unionist communities and Mainland Britain never had to\ndeal with suicide bombings and mass\nmurder on the scale perpetrated by the\ntalk back\nradical Palestinians. Pro-Arab people, too,\nwill point out that the British government\nnever sent helicopter gunships to Bogside\nor the Garvachy Road in reprisal for\nRepublican bombings. Both sides, again,\nare right; the Middle East is in a much\nmore dire situation than we ever experienced in Ireland; much worse in terms of\ncasualty numbers, much worse in terms\nof the brutality involved, much worse in\nterms of the involvement by other regional powers, backing both sides with\nmoney, arms and political brinkmanship.\nOf course, this only means that the solution has to be more drastic and will\nrequire even greater leaps of faith by one\nside or the other than was the case in\nIreland. Unfortunately, though where the\nMiddle East excels is in the entrenchment\nof both sides; their steadfast refusal to\nmove.\nAt which point, predictably, an Israeli\nwill point out that Netanyahu offered\nArafat 97% of the occupied territories\nback in 1997 and an Arab will tell you that\nArafat delivered however many months of\nPalestinian peace in 2000 but the Israelis\ndid not give an inch. Both will insist that\nthese were selfless moves, designed to\nget away from the conflict. Both sides will\nbe lying. Israel's offers of land have\nalways carried conditions, have never\nprovided a solution to the \"problem\" (ie.\nIllegal Israeli occupation of) East\nJerusalem and most imp rot ant ly have\nnever had the backing of the Israeli pe o ple.\nTemporary ceasefire s on the Arab side\nhave always left the threat of a renewal of\nviolence hanging over the Israeli population and have probably been used by\nHamas, etc. to re-arm and scout out possible targets in Israel.\nIn short, the situation can never be\nhopeless but while supporters of each\nside remain blind to the needs, vulnerabilities and aspirations of the other side,\nit's pretty damned close.\nIdris Harding\nYaffle\nDear Felix\nBeing a regular reader of Felix, I have\nnoticed the two subjects which have\nappeared recently in the letters column.\n\n"

Got any\nbend y yellow things left?\nCondom week has been and\ngone.\nNo, I meant the bananas!\nAll gone - chocolate, tea bags,\ncoffee, fruit juice, cereal bars,\nbrazil nut cookies, geo bars\nand divine bars.\nAnd the bananas?\nOK, so we didn't get any free\nsamples of bananas from the\nsuppliers. Buy your own.\nNow you have raised my\nawareness I know that buying Fairtrade goods will solve\nglobal poverty.\nGet real.\nBut I thought you said...\nYes, yes, keep buying the\nFairtrade stuff and kick up a fuss if your supermarket does-n't stock any.\nSo what's the problem?\nFairtrade makes a real difference to the producers, their\nchildren and their com muni ties.\nYes, I'm with you...\nBut the rules of international\ntrade are stacked in favour of\nrich, developed nations.\nLike what?\nSome markets in developed\ncountries are protected from\ncompetition from producers in\ndeveloping countries. The\nWorld Trade Organisation is\nstill dominated by the richer\nnations. The US is willing to\nban the import of steel from\nthe EU and UK, what chance\nhave developing nations?\nSo if we change the trade\nrules then millions of the\nworld's poorest people will\nbenefit?\nYou've got it!\nBut who makes the rules?\nBasically it's the leaders of the\ndeveloped nations at the G8\nsummits and bodies like the\nWorld Trade Organisation.\nSo, don't say: \"I couldn't give a monkey's.\" Do say: \"Tell me more about\nthe Trade Justice Movement\nLobby of MPs on June 19th!\" Thank You\nThanks to all who took part in\nthe Fairtrade events last\nweek. Especially to those who\nstopped to talk about the\nideas behind Fairtrade.

Last November leading\ncharities, aid agencies and\nenvironmental campaigners\ncame together to form the\nTrade Justice Movement.\nThese include Oxfam,\nChristian Aid, Cafod, Friends\nof the Earth, World\nDevelopment Movement and\nPeople and Planet. Not to forget the Banana Link!\nWhat does the Movement\nwant?\nThe Trade Justice Movement\nis calling for a new approach\nto food and farming to protect\nthe livelihoods of poor farmers\nand the environment.\nIt is also arguing against new\nWTO plans for utilities in poor\nnations to be bought by private companies in the developed world and run to make\nprofits.\nThe Movement also wants\nnew global laws to regulate\nthe activities of international\ncorporations.\nWhy now?\nJune 2002 is a pivotal moment\nfor the world's poor.

(Page 11)\nStudent Housing In Jeopardy\nCollege authorities have approved plans\nto sell Clayponds hall of residence in the\nsummer of 2003 for an estimated \u00a38m. Clayponds is situated in Ealing and houses 332 students, mostly first year overseas postgraduates.\nThe College currently plans to refurbish\nSouthside and Bernard Sunley halls in the\nAutumn of 2003. If these refurbishments\nand the Clayponds sale both go ahead as\nplanned then the College will have to find\na least 300 extra bed-spaces just to keep\nits guarantee of accommodation for all\nfirst year undergraduates. There will be\nno space for overseas post-graduates,\nwho are currently recognised as \"priority\ncases\" for a place in halls once all first\nyear undergraduates have been housed.\nAlthough the Rector's Committee on\nStudent Residences met last week, the\nplans were not made public until a meeting of the College Council last Friday. An angry meeting of the Union's Executive\nCommittee on Monday established that\nCollege officials had failed to consult student before approving the plan.\nClayponds: Going, going... gone in 2003\nProfessor Rees Rawlings, the Pro Rector\n(Educational Quality), told Felix that \"the\nstudents should have been informed... it\nshould not have gone to College Council\nas such a surprise.\"\nSenior College officials attempted to\nportray the decision as \"cock-up, not con-s piracy\" and assured Felix that the guarantee of accommodation for all first-year\nundergraduates would somehow be met.\nIn the long term this may involve the\nconstruction of a new hall of residence\nnear to the South Kensington campus. In\nthe short term, it raises the possibility\nthat the sale of Clayponds may be\ndelayed until October 2004 or even 2005.\nMark Tyler, the Warden of Clayponds,\ntold Felix that \"I'm disappointed with the\nshort-term view taken by the College.\"\nHe also questioned the College's commitment towards overseas postgraduates.\nClayponds was bought for \u00a312.5m in\nthe early 1990's and valued in 1996 at\n\u00a311.8m.An informed source, citing the\nrecent surge in London's residential property market, estimated that Clayponds\nmight actually be worth \u00a315m, which\nwould leave the College with an\nunplanned cash surplus of \u00a37m.

    "content": "reviews classic books\nMoby Dick\nHerbert Melville\nFew would argue that Herbet Melville's Moby Dick is a classic\npiece of American literature, yet even fewer would disagree that\nthe novel's opening line, \"Call me Ishmael,\" evokes all the gravity\nof the tragedy to follow.\nMoby Dick is set at the height of the American whaling indus-try, fuelled by the demand for the oil obtained from whale blubber.\nIshmael, our narrator, enlists on the infamous whaler from\nNantucket, The Pequod, for its three-year voyage hunting the vast\nSperm Whale. He and his companion, Queequeg, board the ship\nwithout ever meeting its captain, signed instead by the ship's owners. It is only when the ship is well under weigh for its tropical hunting ground that Captain Ahab finally emerges from his\ncabin to meet the crew, a fearsome man standing with one leg\nfashioned from whale ivory. Ahab unequivocally declares his wish\nfor revenge against the whale that robbed him of a leg - a white\nwhale known as Moby Dick - known throughout the fishery for his\nexpertise at evading capture, feared for his speed and ferocity,\nand recognised by his distinctive white skin.\nThe remainder of the novel takes the broad form of a classic\ntragedy. Increasing unease about Ahab's vendetta and a range of\nmysterious characters encountered throughout the story function\nadmirably as harbingers of doom. Surrounding this conflict and\nthe hunt itself is a vast array of subplots and diversions. Melville,\nhimself a whaler for a time, often lapses in to potentially u nap pealing, detailed descriptions of whaling practice. Ishmael is\noften prone to long discourses on a variety of other topics as well,\noften with only a tenuous link to the story. This perhaps highlights\nMelville's frustration regarding success of his previous work,\nwhich had certainly failed to earn him much renown in literary\ncircles.\nThis book may have its difficulties for the modern reader. The\n19th Century American-English is certainly a curiosity to those\nused to classic English novels. Added to this is a heavy dose of\nsea-faring language, though much of the important terminology is\nexplained and it certainly helps establish the atmosphere.\nWhatever you think of the book's entertainment value, it's undoubtedly worth a read, both as classic literature, and as yet\nanother study of humanity's endless flaws.\nrapt , 1\n\u2022\n]\n' If; Mf jj. MW If c.^ JSSgjjjB\nBrideshead Revisited\nEvelyn Waugh\nBrideshead Revisited was written by diarist Evelyn Waugh during\nthe Second World War. It was Waugh's first popular novel, as he\nnoted once saying that it lost him much of his colleagues' respect.\nDespite this, Brideshead is well known for its exquisite language\nand composition, as well as for its romantic portrayal of England's past.\nThe narrator, Charles Ryder, first meets Lord Sebastian Flyte at\nOxford University and describes the growth of their friendship and\nhis eventual meeting with Sebastian's family. The Flytes live in\nthe archetypal world of early twentieth century aristocracy, evidenced on first sight by their family home - the mansion house of\na town called Brideshead.\nCharles' relationship with the Flytes persists through his\nUniversity life, early career and beyond marriage. While his relationship with Sebastian becomes more sporadic throughout the\nbook, his sister Julia and mother both have strong influences during his life. Many years after the events surrounding the family,\nCharles returns to the house during wartime, where he relates in\nsome of the finest language the events of those years.\nBrideshead Revisited was televised quite some time ago by the\nBBC, maintaining much of Charles' soliloquy, which has thus\nbecome so famous among the generation preceding ours. That\ndrama tis ation fails, of course, to match the book's calibre, as many\nof the underlying themes are lost in an attempt to represent the\nepic plot to a television audience.\nEvelyn Waugh described his work as a study of a connected\ngroup of characters and has succeeded in style. Its paragraphs,\nperhaps overly flowery for some, meander through the narrator's life from late teens to forties, over seas and between complicated\nrelationships, decisions and consequences. Religion, war, politics,\nsexuality, class and love all have a role to play in the narrative.\nSome readers may find the style intolerably extravagant - even\nWaugh edited some of the more indulgent passages when preparing later editions. Also, dramatic action may be found lacking, the\nwork instead taking a more salubrious approach through Charles'\nexperiences. Despite this, I would recommend this novel to any\nreader wishing to witness English wielded by one of the finest\ncraftsmen of his art.\n\n"

Jury's is a fine example of a posh London hotel, all set out\nto impress American tourists\nwith its stunning interior and\nyet was within the budget of\nthe average union committee.\nTicket prices were further\nreduced by generous sponsorship from Shell who should be\napplauded for this and everything else that they do. The\nhotel also offered us entertainments to go with the dinner but the request for clowns\nand juggling dwarves was vetoed at the last minute.\nAttendance was unfortunately thinned by humanities\nexams the next day, a remarkably bad coincidence which\nwas the fault of someone who himself had one of these\nexams. Despite this, everything else seemed to run with\nswan-like smoothness which\nbelied the frantic chaos which\nwent on behind the scenes.\nOn the night itself, sixty or\nso people from a variety\nsports clubs turned up in a dazzling display of snazzy\ndressing which was only surpassed by a Shell representative's full Highland attire\nwhich had to be seen to be\nbelieved. A seating plan that\nleft nobody adrift from their\nmates had been devised and\nthe large Jury's tables had the\nadded benefit of letting the\nplayers of different sports\ninteract in a non-shouting\nmanner.\nFood and wine were expertly distributed by the hotel\nstaff, a pleasing series of fish,\nlamb and lemon meringue pie.\nAccording to those who could\nmake the comparison, the\nChelsea Cup Win\nImperial College A team\nretained the Chelsea Cup on\nMonday 6 May for the third\nyear in a row.\nThe Chelsea Cup is the\nbridge competition between\nstudents and ex-students of\ncolleges and universities in London and is held at Young\nChelsea bridge club in Earls\nCourt. The team this year\nconsisted of Ryan\nStephenson, Charles Leong,\nIan Coombs and Harriet\nDingier. The event's strong\nfield contained eleven teams\nmany of whom were experienced ex-students, but a good performance by IC A that meant they finished second overall, and first of the\ncurrent student teams. IC B team, which consisted mainly\nof players who only started\nplaying this academic year,\nmanaged to come eighth\noverall, a good performance\ngiven their lack of experience\nin competitions. All participants in the competition\nwould like to thank Young\nChelsea bridge club for hosting the event and John Probst\nfor directing the competition.\nICU Bridge Club meets every\nTuesday in Seminar Room 3\non the third floor of the Union\nbuilding, from 6p m.E mail\nbridge@ic.ac.uk for details.\nRyan Stephenson\nfood was even better than the\nUL U Purples Ball but at about\nhalf the price and with a far\nmore flexible dress code. A token enforcement of the\nQueen's Rules lasted until the\npeople from Shell discreetly\ncommunicated their increasing discomfort with the whole\nsituation.\nThose dedicated sportsmen\nand women who had made it\npast the rigorous selection\nprocedure were presented\nwith their half and full colours\nby Tom Pere, head of Shell\nrecruitment. Two special\nawards were given at the end:\nsports personality of the year\nGavin Daisley - who was awarded a bottle of malt\nwhisky to assist with the\nimprovement of his legendary\npersonality and international\ndiplomacy skills - and sportsman of the year Tim Harbour\nwho was awarded a gleam-ing, shiny new cup.\nInevitably the evening\ndescended, downstairs, to the\nnotorious Kavanagh's Irish\nBar for some hardcore alcohol\ntolerance testing and subtle\npraising of dress choices.\nCheers to everyone who helped with the evening, Shell\nfor making it financially viable,\nSen for his show of support\nand smooth talking the guys\nfrom Shell, Penny in the union\nfor doing the tickets, Gary\nRobinson for not attending,\nJury's hotel for providing us\nwith seamless service and a delicious meal, but most\nthanks go to Tim for doing a lot of the donkey work and for\ngiving me a much needed\nsense of urgency.

    "content": "talk felix\nClubs & Societies: Training\nThis term the Union will be embarking\nupon a series of training sessions for newly\nelected club and society officers. By now,\nmost clubs will have elected their committees for next year and it is important that\nthe new incumbents receive appropriate\ninstruction in certain key areas before\nbeginning their duties in October.\nIn taking on the mantle as a Club\nPresident, (sometimes called Chair or\nCaptain) you are responsible to the Chair of\nyour governing committee, and eventually\nthe Union President, for all aspects of your\nclub or society (for example, the Rugby\nClub Captain is responsible to the Athletics\nClubs Committee Chairman). These\naspects range from the health and safety of\nyour members to the financial administration of your club.\nOther members of your committee are\nresponsible for certain elements of the running of your club. For example, the\nTreasurer will clearly deal with the day-to-day financial workings while the Secretary\nwill ensure that the club records are kept in\ngood order and the proceedings of meetings are correctly recorded. These officers\nare all responsible to the Club President for\ntheir particular fields of operation.\nThe Union has certain duties towards\nclubs and societies that it must endeavour\nto fulfil; these include providing certain\nfacilities and resources. Likewise, your club\nor society has duties to the Union, such as\ncomplying with current policy and rules,\nand conducting its operations democratically. We want you to have a basic knowledge of all these things before you embark\nupon your term of office. This is to protect\nyourselves, your members and the Union. It\nwill also make your lives and ours much\neasier come the start-of-term rush.\nYou should have been notified of your\ndesignated session by the outgoing committee of your club or by the Chair of your\ngoverning committee. The new President,\nTreasurer and Secretary (or equivalent) of\nyour club are expected to attend. However,\nwe understand that with exam season\nupon us your availability will be limited.\nThis is why we are offering a number of\nsessions, should you be unavailable for\nyour designated session. If you wish to\ntransfer to a different session, please\ninform the Student Activities Coordinator,\nNick Gore (n. gore@ic.ac.uk), of the session\nyou would like to attend. Due to numbers,\nplease only do this where necessary. It will\nbenefit you to attend the designated session with other clubs of your type.\nThe format of the sessions is as follows:\nan initial introductory session (40-45 mm s) covering general aspects of running a club\nwill be followed by free refreshments. The\nfinal two hours will be divided into four\nshort sessions covering finance, health &\nsafety, running events and\nsponsorship/marketing. You will be divided into four groups for this, moving around\ndifferent rooms so that you attend each\nsession. Although your initial reaction\nmight be that not all the sessions will be\nappropriate to you, I'm confident that you'll\nfind something for everyone contained\ntherein and hopefully it will give you the\nconfidence to try something new as part of\nyour club's activities.\nFinally, a reminder that the training is\ncompulsory, for the reasons outlined above.\nHowever, it's not supposed to be a chore,\nand I hope and expect that you will find it\nuseful and that it will give you the confidence to lead your club effectively next\nterm. Rob\nPoetrySoc: Readings\nWhen you hear someone talk\nabout poetry, what goes\nthrough your mind? Usually\npeople imagine the school days\nwhen teachers would thrust\nupon them some complicated\nlengthy pieces that are just too\ntedious. But really poetry is not\nlike that, it should be appreciated for its beauty, its musical\nand rhythmical quality and its\nunique way of portraying\nthings in another dimension.\nThis is what the Poetry\nSociety is about. There is no\nneed for intimidation, everyone\nis welcome whether they fancy\nthemselves as the next Poet\nLaureate or it's the first time\nthey've written something.\nJust come and read, and share\nit with everyone. There is no\nobligation to read, people can\ncome and support, and just\nenjoy the relaxed chilled\natmosphere and absorb the literary inspiration that will be\nfloating around!\nThere is scope for literature\nas well, in the name of prose.\nMusic will also be an important\nfeature with there being a background tempo for the\nreaders.\nSo what are you waiting for?\ncome to the next meeting of the\nPoetry Society. You'll see poetry\nin a different way, in other\nwords... you'll be enlightened!\nOr, in other words:\n\"Ever pondered the meaning of\nlife wondering why you're here\non this earth?\nLooking for answers to the\nquestions you have and putting a value on your worth?\nDon't worry for you're not\nalone,\nMany others share your philosophical zone!\nDoes the sound of rhyming\nwords or prose,\nBring a tingling sensation to\nyour toes?\nOr the art of making a verbal\nrecipe make sense,\nMake your muscles go oh so\nless tense,\nBecause you feel so relaxed\nand at ease,\nAs for the door to your answers\nyou've found the keys.\nThen my friends the Poetry\nSociety's for you,\nWith literature, philosophy and\nmusic too.\nDon't worry, you don't have to\nbe like the Bard,\nOr even have to try very hard.\nSpeak your mind, a few words\nof what you think,\nOr delegate a speaker in case\nyou go pink!\nCome and listen and get a hold\nof the vibe,\nAnd become a member of this\nversification tribe.\nAttend with an open mind in\nthis ambience of chill,\nAnd be inspired I'm truly sure\nyou will!\nSo whether your love is like a 'red red rose,' or you're a fan of\nthe Jaberwocky,\nJust come and be a part of this\nauspicious Poetry Soccy!\"\nShabnam Parkar\n\n"

    "content": "this week\nEditorial\nI have just spent what seems\nlike a year doing all that\nsnakes and ladders business\non the next page, and to be\nhonest, I really don't have the\ntime. This is because I'm off to\nHolland on a good old jolly\nwith a bunch of sporty types.\nNow I won't claim that I don't want to go, because obviously\neveryone loves to go off on\none and get paid for it, but to\nbe honest, I might be happier\nif the option had never arisen.\nLiving in ignorance kind of\nthing, you see. I'm going\ntomorrow morning, and not\ncoming back until Friday\nnight, so that's an entire week\nof Felixing that I'm going to\nmiss, which all has to be done\ntoday. And I won't be able to\ndeliver it. Hopefully that's all\ngoing to happen anyway, and\na big thanks in advance to\nJohn Stratford.\nSo where's the gossip, I hear you ask. Well there isn't any. I haven't had long\nenough since my last editorial\nto really build up steam and\nget myself into yet another\nprecarious (and sometimes\nwoman related) position.\nMy only mild foray into the\nworld of heartbreak was going to see my ex-girlfriend\nin Birmingham. It has been\nstated that I was mad for\ngoing, but I think that's more\nrelating to the Birmingham\naspect than anything to do\nwith my ex-girlfriend.\nIt was very strange,\nbecause she's a lovely person,\nand as such has not torn up all\nthe photos of us together, and\ninstead has them (amongst\nmany other photos) blu tacked up around her room.\nThus, when I turn up to\nmeet all her new friends for\nthe first time, since they've\nbeen in her room, they all\nrecognised me. This was very\ndisconcerting. Oh, they would\nsay, you're Will, aren't you,\nand then proceed to re gail me\nwith a particular anecdote\ninvolving a tape recorder that\nI shall never be allowed to for-get. Not, of course, that I want\nto.\nAlso, upon introduction to\nanyone who didn't already\nrecognise my beautiful features, it was always 'my ex-boyfriend, Will', which I find\nalways sticks you with a bit of\na stigma. Why, people ask\nthemselves, did they split up?\nWhy are they still friends? AmI allowed to try and pull him\nor her in front of the other. You\nknow the kind of thing.\nAnyway, my point is that one\nday I aim to be introduced to\npeople as 'my friend, Will', or\neven, more simply, 'Will', but I suspect that if that ever hap-pen ed,I would get upset and\nassume that the girl in question was trying to hide the\nfact that we used to be with\neach other.\nI think the main problem is\nthat I'm feeling a bit sensitive\nstill, so perhaps I should just\ngo on holiday; but then regular readers of my column\nknow all about the trouble I get into when I go away, so\nmaybe I 'll just stick around for\na bit.\nOops, I'm going to Holland,\naren'tI?

    "content": "back talk\nAs I have an opinion on both, I will mention both.\nFirstly, I think that most people are sick\nof the NUS debate, and wish it would go\naway. It appears that Mrs Heeps and\nFrancis will not let it go, and are determined to keep the debate going as long\nas possible in the pages of Felix. I have\ntwo solutions: Either they make their correspondence private (ie send it to each\nother without first going via Felix), or,\nafter the last council of the year, they\nhave a properly organised debate where\nthey can air their views at each other and\nif people want to listen to them then they\ncan. I suspect that the prospect of such an\nevent will draw even fewer people to\ncouncil than when council debated the\nconstitution last term. At least people will\nbe there who want to hear the arguments,\ninstead of having them thrust upon them\nin Felix.\nSecondly: about the Middle East. The\nletters which have appeared in recent\nissues have both been correct, but they\nhave only given their half of the story. Yes,\nthere are Arab terrorists, but the Israeli\narmy is really no better. When I was in the\nregion last summer, I saw a refugee camp\njust outside Jerusalem, and how the\nJewish settlement was encroaching on\nthe camp. That very day some of the\nhomes had been bulldozed, for which the\nowners have to pay the Israeli government \"for its services\", so to speak. On a side trip to Ram 'Allah, I was lucky to get\nout again before the checkpoint was closed. I also saw the scene of the suicide\nbombing in Tel Aviv last June.\nBasically the point I want to raise is\nthis: Both sides have done things that\nthey should not. I don't condone suicide\nbombing or any form of terrorism at all.\nEqually, the treatment of the Palestinian\npeople by the Israeli army is nothing\nshort of oppression. To give people an\nindication of what it is like, imagine\nBritish Army tanks rolling into residential\ndistricts of towns in Ireland. The very fact\nthat I, a foreigner, was able to go there\nand leave three weeks later virtually hassle free is something which is denied to\nmost Palestinians - they are not allowed\npassports in the same way virtually\neverybody else is in the world.\nMaybe I have a wrong understanding of\nthe situation, but it seems to me that this\nis the position: The Palestinians want a separate state, and are quite happy that\nIsrael should exist as well. The Israelis\nwant to have a Jewish state which\nincludes all of the current West Bank and\nGaza, and will stop at nothing to achieve\nthis. In that climate there will never be\npeace.\nI am aware that I may make a lot of\nenemies with this, but I think that the\npoints need to be made.\nRichard Thursby\nMaths 2\nCommittee dell'arte\nDear Felix\nAt present I am the Arts Festival\nCommittee for next year. Yes, that is right,\nthe whole committee!\nPros: Quick decision making, getting to\nwrite cheques to myself. Cons: The festival will not happen!\nSo, I need PASSIONATE people (no, not\nthat kind of passionate, Will!). If you want\nto organise four weeks of Film, Theatre,\nMusic, Dance, Art, Workshops and much\nmore in the funkiest, biggest arts fest the\nworld has ever seen, I need you.\nI don't care whether you are Beethoven\nor if you believe that IC Arts are more\nridiculous than white rap gran pa Tim\nWestwood crossed with a chipmunk. Your\ntime and effort will make the festival hap-pen.\nInterested? For more information email\nme at andrew.ca isley@ ic.ac.uk.\ncheers, Andy\nWye Charity Donations\nLast week Wye College students presented just over four thousand pounds to\nthree different charities. The money was\nraised during Charity Week over the past\ntwo years. Many different events were\norganised ranging from tug-of-war over\nthe river and a tractor pull to the traditional Champagne Breakfast and the\nCharity Week Ball. This year all of the\nevents were very well supported, especially the Charity Week Ball which was\nattended by several people from the Royal\nSchool of Mines and from Imperial\nCollege. It was good to see you all there\nand you are warmly welcomed to come\nand join in the events of Cricket Week (14-21 June) which ends with the\nCommemoration Ball.\nThe charities that we supported were\nCancer Research, who received \u00a31046 and\nThe Hospice on the Hill who also received\n\u00a31046. The Hospice on the Hill is an old\npeoples' home that have recently built\nnew premises. They have to raise over\neighty per cent of the money that is\nrequired to look after the people in their\nhome as they can only receive 17% government funding. The other charity that\nwe supported was Kent Air Ambulance,\nas they recently air lifted one of our stu-dents, and they received \u00a32000.\nThank you to everyone that helped\nmake Charity Week successful.\nTom Bradshaw\nCharity Week organiser 2001\nLetter From The Editor\nHello. I 've been accused of let t ting people\nrant on these pages, and I have to admit I do. But I have now declared editorially\nthat I am bored of both of the subjects that\nhave been taking up these pages for the\nlast few months. While I do respect the\nright for people to express their views, I feel this should be moderated, and the letters page should certainly not be turned\ninto a forum for ongoing debate. That is\nnot what it is for.\nAs one of this week's writers has said, if\npeople wish to continue debating these\nsubjects, then they are very welcome to do\nso privately, or, even better, at an open\nmeeting.\nI feel that the past few letters pages\nhave a de qua tley covered both sides of\nboth stories: we have had two pro-Israel\nletters, two pro-Palestine letters, and two\nletters that caution moderation is the key.\nThis would seem, therefore, that this is a good juncture to call an end to that particular debate.\nI will still certainly consider publishing\nletters on the subject, but only if they\nseem to be saying something new.\nOn the subject of the NUS, I have to say\nI think everyone is getting very bored of it,\nincluding me. As such, there will be no\nmore until the issue is raised again on a College level.\nlove will\n\n"
