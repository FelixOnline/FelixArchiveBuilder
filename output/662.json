    "content": "IC 1 XV9 Esher U21 15\nDespite the apparent s Jj gr tg Jie of players on\nthe coach a full team was eventually fielded\nagainst a very large U21 side. The game\nan themed the return of M Windsor in a new\nrole as stand-off. Despite the lack of\nfamiliarity with the position Windsor produced a competent performance the highlight\nof which was a well wot ke d drop goal which\nbrought Jason close rer fears. Other fine\nperformances stemmed fr or n Pete Hagger\nand Simon (I want _.a jn early shower)\nDowning.\nOverall the team produced a fine performance especially ' the forwards who\nperformed excellently in the scrum s and\nwould have ru cke d effectively had the referee\nallowed them. Despite the fact that some\nplayers, including some senior players,\ndecided to return to Hammersmith.\nIClst XV vs Esher\nHaving been warned that it may well turn out\nto be the hardest match of the season, it was\nquite a relief to discover that Esher weren't quite as good as expected. This made for a fairly even match, with IC having the better of\nthe first half. At orange-time we were 9-3 up.\nThe highlight of the first half was Chris\nCarter getting poked in the eye by one of his\nown players, resulting in DC McGee yet\nagain moving into his favourite position in\nthe front row. However, Dave was consoled\nby the fact that the rest of the team agreed\nthat his lightning speed merited a position in\nthe front row.\nThe second half saw Esher coming back\ninto the game, and they were leading by 10-9\n(or 14-9, depending on who was counting)\nwhen the match was stopped due to the\nunfortunate injury of one of their props.\n'Daddy' Davies tried to steal the limelight by\nannouncing that he, too, was injured.\nHowever, this had all been heard before, so\nno attention was paid.\nEsher did offer to finish the game (the last\n12 minutes?) under floodlight at their\ngrounds some time next term\u2014 we all look\nforward to that.\nTalk in the bar afterwards revolved around\nMark Hipsey's beautiful new hairstyle/black\neye combination and about how the\nenthusiasm of the more hardy members of the\nclub appears to have petered out. At this\nthought, everyone sighed with resignation.\nSailing IC vs Brunei 1-0\nOn arrival at Datchet Water we found the\nlake covered in fog and absolutely no wind.\nWhereas the fog did finally clear (with help\nfrom a low fly past by Concord) all attempts\nto get the wind to appear failed. As Caroline\nrefused to do her wind dance around the\nChristmas tree the team set off for a calm,\ngentle and very slow drift on the lake, under\nthese conditions strange forces start to work,\nwhile Andy and Caroline found they couldn't slow down, Phil and Alison's boat decided to\ngo backwards around the wrong side of the\ngybe mark. The team however managed to\npull off yet another victory.\nAfter a break for lunch a 'no olds barred'\n(ie you can cheat) race was held. Richard and\nPete took this to mean that you didn't have to\nround the marks of the course; just sink the\nopposition.\nCricket us from repeating previous night's runner.\nBy the way, lost to Britannia Naval College.\nCaptain's Log.

    "content": "\u2022Letter5-fo.f he ty^or.\nDepartment\nPriorities\nNAT WEST\nBUNK\nUnion\nSlush Fund\nDear Sir\nYou state in the Editorial of\nthe Christmas issue that\n'Sundry Expenses' in the Union\nbudget is \"basically the President's slush fund...do with what\nshe wants to.\" That is the kind\nof misrepresentation which the\nUnion could do without.\nAmong the larger sums\ndebited to this item recently are:\n\u00a3300\u2014subscription to London\nStudent; \u00a3218\u2014hire of tables\nfor Freshers' Fair; and \u00a388\u2014\ntransport for Silwood students\nto Freshers' Day. This term's Union officer elections will take\nat least \u00a3250; and the cost of\nsending you on a typing course\nat the start of the .session was\n\u00a396. The merits or otherwise of\nsuch items can be argued, but\nthey are evidently not the\nwag gon s of some presidential\ngravy train. For its outlay on\nthe FELIX editorship (well\nover \u00a35,000pa) and the total\ncost of FELIX( around\n\u00a330,000pa), the Union should\nreceive fairer and more accurate\ncomment, both on finance and\nother topics.\nYours faithfully\nKen Weak\nHon Treasurer\nIC Union\nEd's Note: Any one of the three\nsabbaticals can authorise expenditure from the sundries account\nwithout any student or student\ncommittee knowing about it: not\neven the Union Finance Committee which is the elected student\nbody supposedly responsible for\nUnion expenditure. All other club\nand CCU expenditure is scrupulously monitored, why on\nearth should the Union Office be\nan exception?\nThe offical line is that the\nsundries account is there to add a little 'flexibility' into the Union\naccounting system. Most of the\nexpenditure is without doubt\nquite valid and legitimate.\nNevertheless it is open to abuse.\nYou know as well as I do. Ken,\nthat the amount spent on so\ncalled 'entertainments' in the\nUnion Office last year ran well\ninto three figures.\nI don't know what you'd call it,\nbut I'd call it a slush fund. That is\nthe kind of misappropriation the\nUnion could do without.\nDear Pallab\nI feel that it is about time\nthere was some debate in\nFELIX about the low priority\nsome lecturers give to under-gr at duat es. Many students have\nhad tutorials cancelled or have\nbeen unable to find their\nlaboratory supervisor because\nthe member of staff is working\non his research. This is encouraged by the promotion\nsystem that usually rewards\ngood research and not good\nteaching ability. Maybe there\nshould be some form of bonus\nfor the good teachers. I am not\nsaying that all our courses are\nnot of a high standard, just that\nthey could be improved.\nYours\nH Southey\nBoozing\nAll Hours\nSir\nIt would appear that the\nopening hours of the Union\nOffice are in something of a decline. For two afternoons,\njust after the end of last term,\nanyone trying to make use of\nthe place found it locked. Of\ncourse, I am sure that the\nconsiderable quantities of wine\nconsumed in there during these\nafternoons were not purchased\nat the Union's expense.\nN Shackley\nFELIX\nLook-Alike\nContest\nDear Pallab\nI wonder if any of your\nreaders have noticed the resemblance between C&G President\nMike Stewart and actress Lilly\nLangtry. Is there any relation-ship. I think we should be told.\nYours sincerely\nMatt Smith\nDear Editor\nSince arriving at Imperial I have been amazed at the low\nstandard of service in what\nappears to be one of England's foremost banks, the National\nWestminster. This bank is\nallowed to occupy a privileged\nposition on campus, and many\nstudents open accounts with the\nbranch for this reason alone.\nApart from student accounts,\nthe NatWest also seems to get\nall the other College and Union\nbanking business. In return for\nthis, they give ordinary students\na service which is inefficient,\nreluctant, forgetful, u nen thus i stic and even indiscreet.\nLet me quote my experiences\nat Edinburgh University for\ncomparison. Edinburgh has\ntwice as many students as\nImperial, spread over two sites.\nThere are four branches of the\nthree major Scottish banks and\nthree automatic cash machines.\nOn these statistics, NatWest\nshould have at least one on-site\ncompetitor, perhaps in the\nUnion Building or Southside.\nWhen I was at Edinbrugh, I was fortunate enough to be a client of the Clydesdale Bank,\nwhere I found quick, friendly,\nefficient and enthusiastic ser-vice. In addition, the\nClydesdale is one of the most\nmodern banks in the country:\nthe Autobank\" cash dispensing\nsystem allows customers to pay\nin cheques and transfer money\ninside the bank using their\ncash card and without the need\nfor the mess of form-filling\nwhich the NatWest seems to\ndelight in.\nLillie LcmQtry\nNaturally, as Alternative\nProspectus Editor, I intend to\nprovide information and advice\non banking for prospective\nfresher s. If anyone has any\ncomments, views or experiences\nwith the NatWest or any other\nbank, I will be pleased to hear\nthem, messages can be left c/o the FELIX Office.\nYours faithfully\nDiane Love\nPhysics PG\nAlternative Prospectus Editor\nArrogant IC\nDear Pallab\nThe question of sending\nvisitors from Imperial College\nto the NUS conference raises\nwider issues than whether the\nexpenditure of \u00a3200 of Union\nmoney is justified.\nWhether we like it or not,\nNUS makes decisions which\naffect students at Imperial\nCollege. Although we may\nchoose to remain unaffiliated to\nNUS, it surely makes sense to at\nleast reopen the dialogue with\nthem. Nothing is to be gained\nfrom an arrogant \"they can't help us\" type attitude.Delegates\nfrom many colleges with differing opinions and ideas attend\nthe conference, and discussion\nof issues of far more immediate\nconcern to students than national politics takes place. By\ndeciding not to send visitors to\nthe conference, IC Union has\nwasted a golden opportunity to\nlearn from these discussions.\nThe cost of sending visitors to\nBlackpool amounts to less than\n0.1% of the Union's sub vent ion from College. Ironically, the\nmoney 'saved' is unlikely to be\nspent for the benefit of students.\nI suspect it will lie idle in the\nbudgets set aside for campaigns\nand contingency funds, and\nremain unused.\nBy refusing to send visitors to\nthe NUS conf s'ence, Imperial\nCollege Union has lost a great\ndeal of potential good will. For\nhow much longer will we let our\nhearts rule our heads to our\ndetriment?\nYours sincerely\nPeter Burt\nMike Stuart\nPage 2 Friday, 13 January, 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "EDITORIAL I'm living to turn the Sports Page into\nsomething more like the sports page of a iii'w sf ibt pcr, as I have received overwhelming\nevidence lh at people only read articles from\ntheir own clubs! So, here are a few guidelines:\n1. The result and brief summary of the\nmatch should be in the first paragraph.\n2. lull names and positions should be\nincluded when referring to a person. (No\nIcam lists though!)\n3. There arc to be no 'in' references or\naccounts of alter match piss-ups.\n4. Read a paper's sports pages (eg the\nDai/v Mirror) to see how reports should be\nwritten. Read The Sun to see how they\nshouldn't be written.\nAny reports not in the above form will be\nthrown away! (Unless I 've written them!)\nOutright silliness is still very welcome,\nprovided it's funny.\nThere is a new weight training facility in\nSouthside consisting of 'free weights'. Any\nstudent wishing to make use of this please go\nand see Ian Bull this lunchtime, or on\nMonday lunchtime, in the Union Office, so\nthat some instruction can be arranged.\nNow for this week's rubbish.\nU AU SE Regional Volleyball\nChampionships\nThe day began at an unearthly 7:00am at S Ken tube station where the conscientious\nmembers of Imperial Mens and Ladies\nVolleyball teams assembled. Certain members of the teams who decided this was far too\nearly (or more likely slept in) met up at\nLiverpool Street at 8:20 and still managed to\narrive at Univ of Essex (Colchester) before\nthe majority of the early birds.\nThe newly formed Ladies Team, present at\ntheir first major competition and playing\nagainst more experienced and skillful opposition started nervously losing their first two\ngames quite easily. However, in their final\ngame of a tournament reclined in length by\nwithdrawals the team put up stiff resistance\n(aided by vociferous support from the men)\nbefore going down to*eventual winners: the\nUniv of Kent, 15-6, 15-10.\nThe men on the other hand had a much\nmore successful day. Playing in a group of\nonly 3 teams Imperial qualified for the semifinals (to be held the following day) by\nbeating Essex 15-6/16-4 and Sussex 15-8/15-2.\nAwards for 'best performances' during the\nday go to:\n1. Andy for the undivided attention he\ngave to the No 2 of the Kent Ladies team\n(more of her next week).\n2. Christos for his impression of a ballet\ndancer ie splits and dying swan im person a tion.\n3. The mens team for their impersonation\nof Hot Gossip.\nDay two of this exciting saga (with pic cie s of No 2) will appear next week!\nMens 1 vs UC won 9-0\nMixed 1 vs Kings won 5-4\nKO Cup vs RH C won 11-0\nThe men's match was ridiculously easy. Even\nIan and John won all three games comfortably. This was quite an achi ev ment as they\nspent the whole time insulting each other,\nwhich is exactly what they do off court in\nthere other roles as ACC Chairman and Vice\nChairman.\nDominic Demento, the Club n utter, terror-is ed the opposition with his on-court war\ndance routine, and this, I feel, played a major\npart in their downfall.\nMixed 1 can't seem to win convincingly,\nprobably because I haven't played for them\nyet. A heroic performance from Miranda won\nthe day, apparently that's what she tells me\nanyway.\nIC v Kings won 5-4\nAn excellent game of badder s at Elephant and\nCastle, what old chap? Negotiated the\ntube\u2014one change somewhere on the blue\ncoloured line and under the silver Tardis box\nto the red coloured amenities centre. Jane\nequipped with silver baubles in her hair,\nMiranda not drunk from wine tasting for a change, and Janet, as ever, in full battle\ncombat of purple leg warmers and blue\neyeshadow. The three guys also came. So we\nmet our opposition from Kings College\u2014\nHengis the Horrible (the one who was 6ft lin,\nbuilt like a Weetabix kid and 10 tons of fuzzy\nhair) was there with her partner Ivan the\nTerrible, a nondescript pair plus their number\none pair who weren't bad\u2014they play at UL U and County level sometimes. Both Janet and\nNigel and Jane and Lee lost against the\nlatter\u2014but Miranda admirably partnered by\nStephen, although losing the first game,\nmanaged to claw their way to 13 all in the\nsecond, where they played to 5 and won 18-14. Unfortunately they lost the third and final\ngame, but we won't mention that! So, in\nallgemeine n, ein sehr gut es Spiel, viel SpaB,\nund hoff ent lich kon nen wir, daB he if Jt IC,\nalles win nen, nicht wah r?

Thanks Miranda! The rest\nof you are all lazy gets l Sports Ed)\nWe've had a pretty dod gy first term really,\nwith things not looking as good as last season.\nStill, we're in the knockout cup semi-finals,\nand should win four or five of the six leagues\nthat we're in. There's still not much\nenthusiasm for playing in matches, though,\nand those who have been enthusiastic have\nbeen rewarded by getting injured, or bored\nwith playing too much.\nNow for the good news: the badminton\ntour to Dublin is on for the weekend of 11\nFebruary.

The\nLSE's tactic of wearing the same colour as the\nopposition was also thwarted as Imperial\nwere recognisable partly because of their\nexpensive new socks and partly because they\nwere the team consistently receiving bad\nline out ball and being pushed off their own\nball in the scrum. Despite the setbacks\nImperial scored the first try but in the second\nhalf LSE gained a strong lead (being naturally\nstrong on their left wing) and it was only sheer\ngrit, determination and fluke which enabled\nImperial to get back into the game when\nMark Hassel kicked two penalties in\nsuccession and Jan Wiur scored under the\nposts after a well timed interception by John\nGillees. Thus motivated, Imperial four up a strong show in the last ten minutes but time\nwas not on their side and the d is a ppi on ting performance ended with an unnecessary\ndefeat.\nFELIX Friday, 13 January, 1984 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Draughts This term there will be a weekly draughts problem, based on the weekly column in the Edinburgh Evening News by J. Love. To get you started this week, there is a sample problem and solution. This problem was composed by Joe Charles of Wrexham. The problem for you to solve on your own is also by Joe Charles and the solution will appear with next week's problem. Goodluck! It's not as easy\nas you think!\nI expect most people already know the\nrules of draughts, but in case you never\nlearned to play, or need to be reminded,\nhere they are.\nDraughts is played on the dark squares of\nthe board, but for clarity the problems are\nshown with the pieces on the white squares.\nThe playing squares are numbered from 1 to\n32 as shown in fig. I. At the start, black\noccupies squares 1 to 8 with single pieces\nand white has squares 25 to 32. Singles are\nonly allowed to move forward in diagonal\nsteps of one (like a pawn's capturing move\nin chess). However, singles capture a piece\nby jumping over it (not landing on it)\nproviding that there is a clear square to land\non. If, after capture, there is another piece\nwhich can be captured, that is taken too. In\nfact, the player must capture any piece\nwhich he can take. (In the event of a player\nhaving two pieces which can both capture\nopposing pieces, he is allowed to choose\nwhich one to move.) When a single reaches\nthe far side of the board (squares 1 to 4 for\nwhite-this is known as black's crown head) the single is crowned with another single,\nand becomes a king. The king can move\nforwards or backwards in diagonal one-steps.\nThe object, of course, is to capture all\nyour opponents' pieces.\nIn the solutions, each move is written with\nthe starting and finishing positions joined by\na dash, eg 1-5. However, this may involve\nFig 1 \u2014 draughts board numbering\nzigzagging round the board, capturing lots\nof pieces in one move. Problems with\nsolutions which involve lots of capturing are\ncalled strokes. There are also problems\nwhich end in forced stalemates.\nFinally, do not despair if you have no\ndraughts pieces; use chess pawns as singles\nand other chess pieces as kings. Have fun!\nThis week's problem\nBlack: 12, 14, 25; Kings: 15, 19.\nWhite: 8, 11, 29; Kings: 1, 22.\nWhite to move and win.\nSolutions and all correspondence to\nFELIX Office by Wednesday 1pm. Fabulous\nPrize\nRandomly selected winner gets a free cocktail in the Southside Bar!\nThe game\nof draughts\nDraughts (also known as checkers in the\nUS) is a game often thought to be trivially\neasy by people who have played it, but\nknow little about it.

    "content": "Feature1. THE SAD STORY OF THE STUDENT GRANT On 17 November Sir Keith\nJoseph, Secretary of State for\nEducation and Science,\nannounced that \u00a390m is going to\nbe cut from the education budget\nover the next three years. Student\ngrants will be increased by 4%\nnext year. This is more than the\npublic sector pay figure of 3%,\nhowever taking inflation into\naccount it means that students\nwill once again face a cut in their\ngrants in real terms. Sir Keith\nalso announced that the parental\ncontribution scale is to be adjusted to increase contributions\nfrom those parents with residual\nincomes in the middle and upper\nreaches of the scale, and that the\nminimum grant is to be halved.\n'Revised arrangements' for repayment of travelling costs are to\nbe announced later.\nThe effect of removing the\ntravel allowance will be (or so the\nGovernment hopes) to induce\nstudents to live in their parents\nhome and attend Colleges within\nreasonable distance to this.\nWhy should I care?\nFuture cuts in education spending are going to hurt you! They're\ngoing to reduce your grant, place\nyour job at risk, eat away at your\nfacilities and equipment. Young\npeople (your brothers and sisters)\nhoping to go to college will find\nthe door being slammed in their\nfaces. Your parents will have to\npay more for your education.\nAnd, in the long run, the\neconomy will only suffer if people\ncannot cope with new tech-no logy. Unemployment and\nslower growth will mean a lower\nstandard of living for you in the\nfuture.\nWhat does this mean to^students?\nIf you receive full grant, you will\nonly receive an extra \u00a380 in next\nyear's grant. This works out at\nless than 30p more per day.\nThose students whose parents\nhave a residual income of more\nthan about \u00a312,000pa( about\n50% of students at IC) will have\nto sponge even more money from\nthem than at present.\nPerhaps the most alarming\naspect of Sir Keith's statement is\nhis plan to change the method of\nmeeting our additional travel\ncosts. It is widely expect ded that\nthe present method of full\nrepayment will be replaced by a flat rate travel allowance.\nThis would mean that if, for\ninstance, you lived in one of the\n1\nSir Keith Joseph is committed to axing \u00a390m from\nthe Education budget over the next three years, a questionnaire has been sent out to all universities to consider\npossible cuts in resources of 1-2% per student a year.\nIn the first of a series of articles, Peter Burt examines the\nlong term implications of these cuts and the effect they\nwill have on you now.\nmore remote parts of the country\nor travelled daily by tube into\nCollege, you would be expected\nto heavily subsidize the fares\nfrom your own pocket.\nWhat of the future?\nThe Government is committed to\nmaintaining a constant level of\npublic expenditure until 1987,\nand this will probably mean that\neducation spending will suffer in\nthis period.\ncurrent contraction of the poly-technic s. A major questionnaire\nfrom the University Grants Committee (the body which, among\nother things, supervises the distribution of funds to the universities) recently asked the universities to consider the effects of\npossible future cuts in resources\nper student of l2% pa, although\nSir Keith Joseph has state a^ j^j* there is no present int\nstudents in further education\ncolleges receive no grant at all,\nand that mature students who\nmay have to leave a job to take\ntheir course will have additional\nneeds.\nIdeally the system of student\nfinancial support would eventually be reformed to encompass\nall these needs. However, there is\nobviously a major catch. All this\nwould cost a lot of money.\nGiven the general contempt\nwith which students are held,\nneither the Government or electorate are likely to advocate\nspending money to increase\nstudent grants. All that we can do\nat present about this is to point\nout the importance of education\nd. the crucial need for highly\ngraduates for the long\nFELIXl\nMr Peter Brooke, the Minister\nresponsible for Higher Education\nhas told students that 'the\nhatches are battened down' and it\nwould be 'wholly incorrect' for\nstudents to expect significant\nimprovements in living standards\nin the future. Mr Brooke 'recognises the illegality and unfairness\nof the parental contribution\nsystem' but, as we have seen, has\nno plans for phasing it out.\nFurthermore, the Department of\nEducation and Science has not\nyet considered possible transfer\nof funds from other Government\ndepartments and administrative\nsavings to offset the cost of any\nimprovements.\nAll this must be seen in the\nlight of possible cutbacks for the\nuniversities themselves following\nto implement such a policy.*\nSuch politics would nard ly increase educational opportunities or the quality of education\nreceived by students. They may\nalso force universities to increase\nhall and refectory charges to a greater degree than otherwise,\nand introduce library fees and\nsuchlike, thus hitting students'\npockets even harder.\nThe alternative\nFew students would object if\ntheir grants were to be increased\nto a realistic level and maintained\nat this level. In the eyes of the law,\nstudents over the age of 18 are\nindependent adults, and it would\nseem reasonable to reflect this by\ngradually abolishing the parental\ncontribution. We must also remember that a great many\nterm economic well-being of the\ncountry.\nWhat can I do?\nThis term, Imperial College\nUnion will be running a campaign directed towards putting\nour case about grants and\neducation policy over. We hope\nto organise a letter-writing campaign to MPs, possibly supported\nby other events to demonstrate\nour concern.\nYou can participate by writing\nto your MP( details from ICU Office), telling your parents and\nother interested parties what it\nmeans to them, and finding out\nmore by participating in any\nevents organised.\nI Friday, 13 January, 19841 \\Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Presidential Patronage The Union President has once again filled the posts of Warden and Subwarden at the Fremantle without going through the normal procedure of\nadvertising the vacancies and interviewing the applicants. Her reasons for\nnot going through the normal procedure was that 'No suitable candidates\nwere found from previous residence interviews and there was no time to\nadvertise and carry out interviews.'\nI don't know whether this is lazy ness or stupidity on Gaynor's part. More\nlikely a case of meg lo mania on Michael Arthur's part, who recommends\nsuch appointments. Gaynor's action is not only unfair to the numerous\npeople who want warden ships or sub warden ships but bad management too.\nBetter candidates will be found by interviewing from a larger number of\napplicants.\nWhat has been happening is that appointments have all been made by the\nUnion President on the recommendation of Michael Arthur. As a result\nthere have been several people appointed to positions for which they have\nbeen clearly unsuitable and there have been a number of personality clashes\nresulting in unpleasantness at the Fremantle.\nAs it is, the new warden Nick James was the obvious candidate for the job\nand will probably make a very good warden. Nevertheless a proper\nappointments procedure should be followed in which all posts must be\nautomatically advertised and all candidates should be interviewed by a proper interview panel.\nFELIX Blues This is my 13th issue on Friday the 13th and at the time of writing 1 have no\nidea when this issue is going to come out. The regular printer has fallen ill.\nApologies then if this issue is not out on time. I really do think I 've picked the\nwrong sabbatical at times.

I should have gone tor a nice\ncushy number in the Union Office sipping sherry and eating pate all day.\nFeatures At Imperial we can boast some of the best clubs and societies in the country.\nI feel it is a shame that they do not receive the coverage they deserve, an\narticle on the clubs page is hardly sufficient. I would therefore like to do a series of features on the clubs at IC each week. I would therefore like to see\nany club captains or society chairmen who are interested in having their club\nfeatured.\nI would also like to do a series of features on topics which are not directly\nrelated to College but are nevertheless of interest to students. Peter Burt has\nstarted a series on education cuts. Next week there will be something on the\nJanuary sales, the week after there will be a feature on underwater\nphotography.

If you happened to spot the\nkey, it was easy. If not, you could have been going\nround in circles for ever. Simply divide the nth number by n, and substitute each number for its corresponding letter in the alphabet and the answer is\n'How much does a Union freebie cost?' Of the eight\ncorrect solutions, PM Fisher, a Mech Eng PG was\nthe randomly selected winner.\nPrize Long Division\nIn order to get my eternal admiration, and \u00a310,\npeople took this puzzle incredibly seriously. Someone took eight days to do it, another stayed up\nall one night to do it, another took two days and\nprogrammable calculator to do it, and those are just\nthe ones who got it right. Apologies if you spent all\nyour Christmas holiday doing it. As a result of by\nbuilding it up so much, it became the most entered\npuzzle, and of the nine correct entries, Vernon\nGaskell of Civ Eng 2 can collect his \u00a310 after Monday\nafternoon.\nThe solution is too long to print, but the answer is to\ndivide 667334 into 7752341.\nSquare-wheeled bicycle\nIf the length of the side of a wheel is 2a, the largest\ndifference in potential energy that the bicycle can\nhave is the difference between a wheel standing\ncorner over corner and lying flat, and equals (J2-1)mga. This is equal to the change in vertical KE. Since the vertical KE is zero at the top, then when the\nwheel is on the ground, it must be (72-1 )mga.\nSo Vy =/2a( V2-1)g. Since the wheel axle is moving in a direction at 45\ndegrees to the horizontal, Vx = Vy\nTherefore the maximum speed before its wheels\nstart to leave the ground is/2a( \u00ab/2-1)g.

Last term there was a growing campaign to have it reopened led by Tim Wilson, Life\nSciences Dep Rep and Ian\nFrench, Assistant Departmental\nSupervisor, with the support of\nFELIX. Professor Wood had\nbeen insisting that the service\ncould only re-open if it were self-financing, but he has now\ndropped this condition.

The appointment of Nick\nJames, previously one of the Fremantle sub wardens, to replace Andrew\nWalker (who resigned last term) was approved by Union President\nGaynor Lewis on the recommendation of Student Services Officer\nMichael Arthur.\nMr James' post of sub warden has been filled by Mark Green,\nwho was also appointed without\nthe post being advertised although he had been interviewed\npreviously for a different post.\nThe other sub warden post,\noriginally occ up ed by Ruby Tan,\nAndrew Walker's live-in girl-friend, is to remain vacant. It\nseems the post was only created\nin the first place to prevent any\nofficial embarrass e ment over the\nfact that they weren't married.\nMeanwhile, Nigel Simmons,\nthe Fremantle assistant sub warden, has resigned his post.\nThis resignation appears to be\nunconnected with recent events\nat the Fremantle with Mr Simmons giving his reason for\nresignation as the low standard of\nhis accommodation, which made\nit difficult for him to do any\nacademic work. However, it\nseems that his position will not be\nfilled for the time being, which\nwill mean that the number of\nwardens in the Fremantle has\nnow dropped from four to two.\nMiss Lewis claimed that the\nnormal procedure for the\nappointment of wardens and\nsub wardens was not followed\nbecause there was insufficient\ntime (the same excuse used when\nAndrew Walker was appointed)\nand there had been interviews\nheld for other posts earlier so\nanyone interested in applying \u2022\nwould presumably have applied\non a previous occasion and been\nturned down.

Recent examples are\nthe long delay in replacing the\ntelephone system and the\ndifficulty in financing the repairs\nto the Electrical Engineering\nbuilding. And because of\nfinancial constraints the\nSouthside heating system has had\nto be replaced gradually over\nfour years, ending this summer,\nwhilst the cycle of periodic\nrepainting of all buildings has\nbeen abandoned.\nThe College is concentrating\nonly on repairs necessary for\nhealth and safety reasons, but\nthe result of this will be\nincreasing unreliability of\nbuilding plant and general\ndeterioration of structures.

See Dave Watson for more details.\nFinally, Mr Gareth Fish tells me that if the\nweather is clement then Jez will be going\npumping on the 15th.
