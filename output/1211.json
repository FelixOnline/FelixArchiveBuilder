    "content": "Singles\nby Celine & Elsa\nGoldfrapp - Utopia Genetically\nEnriched (Mute)\nThis is rich, as to the warm voice of Alison\nGoldfrapp are added several layers of synths\nand violins. The soprano backing vocals in\nresponse of male choirs are amazing, but this\ntrack isn't as strong and stirring as the first\nsingle Human.\nNeil Finn - Last to Know\n(Parlophone)\nAn acoustic guitar and a nice voice that\nmakes a gentle song. It's inoffensive and fortunately short enough not to make this poor\nmelody boring. Neil Finn has done better with\nhis previous single.\n#)#)###\nFaithless - We Come One\n(Cheeky)\nI guess it's a good club hit, one of these that\nwill make you move and dance until dawn. I still believe though (old fashioned, I know)\nthat this kind of rhythm is boring at home, so\nwhere's the point in buying it?\nManifesto - JBN: All I Want\n(Underdog)\nSame style as above, but these dance beats\nare uninspired and bloody annoying, even\nafter a few drinks, and the aggressive design\nof the sleeve doesn't help. But it includes a full video...\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 # #\nDina Carroll - Someone Like\nYou (Mercury)\nMaybe you can offer this single to your 10-year old sister who has already all the Whitney Houston discography. If you don't have that kind of sister, don't think about it\nanymore.\n3 LW No More( Baby I 'ma do1 \u00ab\nCute slice of Rn'B pop trifle. These \"3 little\nwomen\" (how patronising is that?) do a nice\nline in d it zy pop with a side helping of street\nc red. This song isn't too bad, and the girls put\non a great performance.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSpacek - How do I move?\n(Island)\nThis piece of calm Rn' B is prefect to chill out after the beat hammering club.\nDowntempo and soft vocals reign for a real\ntreat; this makes a change from all commercial rubbish Rn' B you can hear on the radio.\nEven if it's not really my taste, I definitely\nenjoyed it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLimp Bizkit - My Way\n0\nI Although you all probably know about th ii band, I 've got to review their new single, whicH\nis utterly crap. The climax of fat, heavy, uninspired, skate-punk as ugly as Fred Durst pic\nface. Let's face it, he cannot even rap, ju s is qe al his miserable lyrics. I'm only interest ec why the hell he always put his hands on his will)\nwhen dancing.\nWitness - You are all my ow rj invention\nIs this the words of ades es per ate fan or a lone\nly lover? The song doesn't sound grim, bu i rather lively and optimistic, in a kind of REM\nAutomatic for the people period vocals anc\nmelodic style. Perfect to listen on the road for\nthe beach, or maybe you can find a more funky\nJinrai - Someplace else\nJazzy sirocco that warms up the mood, the j az touch remains soft, a flu t and strings spice up j the sound. Dominating vocals, reminding me oi Jamiroquai, make all the song. Pretty nice td j listen to, may not be jazz avant garde (o maybe as I'm far from being an expert), some!\nsoul Rn B influences, deadly effective for aj\nlounge flavour.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ab \u2022\n\u202227th June 2001 \u2022 Felix\n\n"

    "content": "Albums\nScuba Z The Vanishing American\nFamily\n(Odd Records)\nThis album is a musical pick 'n' mix\nof big beat, funk, house and just\nabout anything else you can think of.\nEccentric, eclectic and, at times, a little bit messy, this is an album that\nnever disappoints.\nFrom the crazy funk of / Don't Get Out Much to the guitar y/ acid\nhouse crossover of Sharon Stone's House, each track is different and\nnever really sounds like something\nyou' ve heard before the album keeps you on the edge of your seat,\nwondering where it'll go next.\nWhilst featuring the singles Californian Paranoia and Instant Whip, I found that all of the tracks are equally appealing in their own way, but not\nto everyone's taste. For example, if\nthe Vengaboys is as left field as you\nlike your music, don't bother with this\nalbum (in fact, if that is the case, how\ncan you live with yourself?!).\nThis is a seriously tasty little\nalbum and is definitely worth getting\nyour hands on.\nPatrick\nPublic Domain\nHard Hop Superstars\n(Xtrahard)\nThere are good tracks on this\nalbum, like Rock Da Funky Beats\nand Operation Blade with their hands\nin the air moments, and the surprisingly laid back Pump Up Nation...\nHowever, whilst you would dance\nto most of this, there is the underpinning fact that everything is actually\ntoo gimmicky, a little insipid and a little unoriginal for this to actually be a good album. At least they're not\nOxide and Neutrino.\nPatrick\nKing Adora\nVibrate You\n(Superior Quality Recordings)\nKing A dora management meeting:\nBoss of record label: \"So we've\nsigned the band. They've got to\nrock like Iggy Pop on cheap orange squash and E numbers.\nThey need tunes, arrogance and\nsome guitars. They've got to have\nsex appeal.\"\nKA Manager: \"OK. Check \"rock-ing\". Check tunes and arrogance.\nCheck sex a ppe.... oh fuck.\nThey're pug ugly.\"\nBoss of record label: \"Oh well.\nWe'll dress them like early Manic\nStreet Preachers who've met\nsome goths down a dark alley. No\none will notice.\"\nAnd you have King A dora. Who do take after MSP, but\nwithout the intelligence. They've\ngot the tunes though. The debut\nalbum from the Birmingham four\npiece is polished, and you can see\nwhy NME put them on their cover\nover a year ago. But if you're\ngoing to \"do\" arrogance, you really have to be the dog's testicles\nto get away with it. Singles Bionic and Suffocate are slabs of\npop rock that will have the kids\nmoshi ng in the aisles, but Maxi\nBrowne's whine, which is at first\nalluring, really begins to piss me\noff after the 4th or 5th track\nwhich replaces a chorus with a whining scream. Maxi says on the\nfinal track \"I will irritate you\". No\nneed, Maxi. You're good enough\nat it already.\nAnd when they drop in a few\nelectronic beats here and there to\nprove their modernity, you just\nknow that there was someone\nfrom A&R lounging in the studio\nsaying \"Yeah guys, it'll sound\ngreat, trust me\" as the band\nstood there looking unsure.\nHowever, don't get the\nimpression that there is anything\nwrong with this CD. Every song\ndoes have big shiny sharp hooks\nthat you could catch a shark with.\nThe lyrics (between the whines)\nare never banal. The solos are\nnever cheesy. There is not a song\non the disc that you would really\nwant to fast forward through.\nNevertheless it is easy to tell\nwhich songs were, are, or shall be\nsingles: the songs easily fall into\n\"power pop\" or \"punk/gia r rT^ ats-go ries. They're not the Manics.\nThey're not Mansun. But they're\nthe next best thing: the Manics\nfor those who can't be arse d to\nread Marx and find out what\nWillem de Kooning used to con-template. (Oh, and buy the special edition: extra tracks and\nvideos. You can show it off when\nKA have sold out and boast about\n\"owning rare early stuff'.)\nChris\nPreston School of Industry\nAll This Sounds Gas\n(Domino)\nPreston School of Industry, featuring guitarist Scott Kannberg, are\nmost likely to appeal to fans of Kannburg's former band, Pavement. In the\nsame mould as Pavement, they have a quirky guitar-based sound, with whimsical vocals and a strong backline.\nThe overall feel of All This Sounds\nGas is one of a band having fun, and\nas a result the music is fairly uplifting\n- perhaps one to listen to over the\nsummer months - but there is also an\nedge to the music hinting at something a bit more \"serious\". The songs\nare experimental, but maintain a distinctly poppy appeal. It could be\nargued that Steve Malkumus is doing\nthis kind of thing better but still, this\none is worth a listen.\nMark Hammond\nThe London Xpress Album\n(Nuphonic Records)\nw; th rare cuts from the likes of\nCold cut, Groove Armada and\nRed Snapper, I was expecting something pretty special from this compilation of artists who have contributed to\nmm\nthe London Xpress Radio show over\nthe last year. It is certainly eclectic, and\nalmost every track refuses to fall into a, specific dance music category.\nHowever, a broad theme of downbeat |\nelectronica emerges, with hints of tech-no, dub and jazz creeping in occasional-ly. Sabres of Paradise, David Holmes |\nand even Bjork are also featured.\nUnfortunately, there are no real\nstand-out tracks, which could explain\nwhy they haven't been released before.\nSome of the stuff does sound quite\nexperimental and progressive, but like\nall experiments, it doesn't always produce good results. There is some good j stuff here, but I'd only recommend this I to comp let is ts who already have a lot of I these artists' material. Tom\nFrequency \u202227th June 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

    "content": "friends here is a single mother. All of the generalisations are just untrue.\nDo you think there is an issue of IC's image outside of college? Ithink it is a bit of a problem. The first impression that a lot of people get is that of loads of\nguys, and I suppose that some do look geeky.\nWhat is a geek? Someone wearing very conventional clothes,\nwith their hair greased back, wearing glasses. I always thought a geek was just a stereotype,\nbut I have seen a few people round who really\nlit the image, just visually though - I don't know\nthem. They lock themselves in their rooms, and\nplay with their computers for hours. But generally people are fine. All my friends are really\noutgoing.\n[Do you think it is a problem? Is it ao eg at ive thing? It would be a problem if it was the majority, but\nit is such a tiny minority, and I think you get\nthem at any university.\nDo you think that the external image of\nIC has affected you? Not directly, and I don't think it would, because\nthink that the academic reputation of Imperial\noutweighs any other image. They think \"good\ncollege\", I don't think it's the first thing that\nthey think of.\nSo why do you think all of the see xter lal university guides have honed in on\nibis?\nlone person just wandered round the Union,\nIhey probably would see more guys than girls\nand draw conclusions from that. If they were\nactually at the uni, they would see that there is\nso much more to IC.\nPeople at IC are a lot more single minded than\nat other un is and want to do well. Whether\nthey wear Iron Maiden T shirts and tatty white\ntrainers is neither here nor there. It's an external perception that these people are geeks.\nElaine, Medicine\nWhat do you think of the IC's image, and is that image relevant? I don't think it should matter what image some\none else has put on your university. It should\nonly matter what you perceive yourself as. If\nyou're happy with yourself and what your per-son al it y's like, it shouldn't really matter what\nother people have labelled you as. If people\ncome up to me and say \"you're from IC\" and\ntherefore it must mean a certain thing, I would-n't let that bother me.\nDo people judge you? A couple of people have said, \"Oh you're at IC,\nit must be really unnerving, there's so many\nmales.\" When you come in the first year, it is\nkind of strange at first. There are so many\nboys, but gradually it'sO K, it's not too bad.\nBoys make great friends, if not better friends\nthan girls.\nIt's natural that a certain proportion are going\nto be \"electronically gifted\" [geeky], shall we\nsay. With so many guys, I don't think that proportion is any worse than at other un is. Also,\nbeing a university of science and technology,\nyou do expect people to be more into science y things, which is perhaps one of the things that\nis associated with geeks.\nAre you a geek?( laughs) Well, maybe... I don't lock myself\naway in my room.\nIs it a negative image? I don't think it is. If it makes us seem hard\nworking and intelligent, I think that's a good\nthing.\nHeather, Medicine (again!)\nWhat do you feel about how IC is per-ce i ved by the public? I think it's a shame that we do have that image,\nbut I think people should realise it's not like\nthat, especially because there are more girls\ncoming into IC now. The medical school has\nchanged that sex ratio quite a lot. With any\nscience subject, there is always that reputation\nof geeks and nerds. I think that could offend\nsome people, because they don't want to be\nclassified as such, on the other hand, we are a lively bunch, and science isn't just about reading books.\nHave you had negative experiences from being associated with IC? Sometimes people think I am nerd, but that's just ridiculous. I think it's more of a male thing\nto be honest. I have female friends who came\nhere to do engineering and chemistry, and they\nweren't put off by the image.\nWhere does the image come from? I think it's propagated by rugby player types\nFeature \u2022 27th June 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

The study identified a pre-ci usl yun characterized genetic mutation as\nKing a significant risk factor for the disease,\n(hen present alongside other known genetic\nBuses. Yet as editors pieced together the\nj test 'study prompts cure hope' headlines,\ndatives of sufferers could be forgiven for\nli shing scientists would leave the area alone.\nVhy? Genetic testing for a disease benefits\n[ro ups other than those at risk - it benefits\nis ur ance firms.\nEuropean Observatory on HealthCare Systems. What surprised me most was the\nlack of a central European legal ruling on the\nsubject. While in Holland genetic information\nincludes family history and can not generally\nbe used by insurance companies, German law\nrequires that applicants reveal all known medical information.\nThere is (of course) a more general ethical\nand philosophical issue lurking here. Scientific knowledge about our species, be it\ngenetic tests for disease or psychological evaluations of intelligence, is appearing in\non side r the following situation, set some- ever increasing amounts. It allows us to dis-.here in early gg Insurers also think11 t ingui sh** between in di it's nice to know vi du a is on\nlist century i rita in. Your fa in-ly has a history of\nll zhe i mer's and a new genetic test is avail-i ble, allowing you to see if you too carry the\nnut ation. You understand that carrying the\naul ty gene does not mean you will get the\nlis ease, just that you are more likely to. In\nmy event, it would be nice to know, wouldn'tn surer s also think it's nice to know. What e ally bugs them is when you know and they\nlon't. This is perfectly understandable; if you\ni ere to be carrying the mutation one of the\ni rst things you would probably do is up your\nfe assurance policy. Insurers are quite right-1 suspicious of the possibility of fraud, and\n\u00bb will ask you to reveal the results of any\nj ene tic tests you have taken, just as required\nbra plethora of other medical tests.\nIhe Catch22 situation that develops is simi-ar to the HIV insurance dilemma. If you the basis of health and\nability like never before. Consider insurance\nagain: In the old days we all essentially paid\nthe premium for those unfortunate souls who\npop their clogs three decades before their\ntime. Now few of us are prepared to subsidize the policies of those with a high chance\nof dying early, especially if they knew the risk\nfactors but failed to declare them to the\ninsurer.\naven't been tested an insurance company\n\u00bbill have no information to go on, except for\nis king the usual lifestyle questions. No Jritish insurer will force you to take genetic\ntests. Consequently avoid being tested and\nour premiums are likely to stay at their cur-ent supposedly low level. On the other hand,\nlou want to know, don't you? When it comes\n:\no filling up the policy application, however,\nIOU risk committing fraud if you fail to\nie clare the result: The Association of British\ninsurers' pre1999 policy statement reads\nPeople wishing to take out new life insurance\njol ici es will continue to be required to report\ni he results of any genetic tests\". There is a real chance that people will avoid possible\n>a rly detection of a disease simply to keep\n;heir premiums down.\ntone of this is particularly new. I was remind-;d of the debate after reading an article in\nlSE Magazine (LSE's alumni rag), written by\nVina Dixon and Dr Elias Mossialos from the\nan individual's success in life, this made sense - we were introducing a sense of fairness into an unfairly chaotic world. As we discover more and more genetic factors that\ncontribute to all aspects of our lives this natural socialism is and will continue to be e rod ed. Coupled with the increasingly deterministic world-view of our blame-culture, it is a recipe for social disaster.\nI started with a piece of scientific research,\nand noted that even the best-intended science will raise problems and issues beyond\nits original domain. There is simply no such\nthing as objective ethically neutral research.\nDuring my time at Imperial I was constantly\namazed by how little interest many students\nshowed in the humanities and social sciences,\nindeed often in any fields outside of their\nown.

It also allows for the partial obliteration of the\nMines Building, continuing a project which dates back to the late 1950s.

Belt-Tightening\n(from the private sector) and Mr Lucrative Overseas-Fees (from the\nManagement School).\nThe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, also announced that he will be working very\nclosely with the four new principles. Speaking to a selection of high-profile\nalumni and royalty at last week's commemoration of the Royal School of\nMines' second anniversary, Sir Richard said, \"These are pre-eminent principles which are respected internationally in work in science, engineering and\nmedicine... and are the ideal leaders to help the College evolve in this dire c tion.\"\nSir Richard's speech was the highlight of a weekend's celebrations to commemorate the second anniversary of the RS M.

    "content": "screen Upcoming Summer Movies!\nJuly\nFirst up for July is Tomb Raider,\nstarring Angelina Jolie. Following\nthe slating by the American media,\nI think that computer games made\nfrom films is possibly moe effective\nthan vice-versa. Look out for some\nunexpected appearances, including\nRim mer from Red Dwarf. High\nHeels and Lowlifes is a brit flick\ndirected by Mel Smith. The plot\nsurrounds how a nurse plots to\nblackmail some bank robbers out of\ntheir heist. With a cast including\nMinnie Driver and Michael Gambon( always superb), this\ncould be one to watch for. This is\nreleased at the same time as\nJurassic Park III. Steven Speilberg\nis not having anything to do with\nthis one, so if you thought JP II\nwas a JP too far, I wouldn't even\nconsider this one. However, the\ncast is surprisingly strong, Sam Neill, William H Macy and Tea Leoni, so we may be all in for a pleasant surprise. More appealing\nseems Swordfish starring John Travolta and Don C head le. Basically a heist film with a twist, it\nfollows how a computer hacker\ntries to rob $6 billion dollars from\nthe government. Vinnie Jones also\nmakes an appearance in this one.\nAugust\nFirst this month is Rush Hour 2,\nAnything with Jackie Chan has got\nto be worth a good look. Final Final\nFantasy: The Spirits Within is a computer animated film which looks\nabsolutely staggering. However, the\nJapanese element is noticeable with\nthe indecipherable plot outline: A female scientist makes a last stand\non Earth with the help of a ragtag\nteam of soldiers against an invasion\nof alien phantoms. One for the SciFi freaks amongst us perhaps. Tim\nBurton serves up Planet Of The\nApes in mid-August. With Mark Wahlberg as the astronaut who\n'accidentally' arrives on a strange\nplanet ruled by aliens after going\nthrough a wormhole. This promises\nto be one of the films to watch this\nsummer. Personally I'm interested in\nseeing Helena Bonham-Carter as a chimpanzee. Paul Hogan and Linda\nK oz low ski return for Crocodile Dundee in LA. This could be m idly enjoyable or unbelievably bad. You\nhave been warned.\nSeptember\nOne to definitely look out for is\nMoulin Rouge, with Nicole Kidman\nand Ewan McGregor. It may be an\nacquired taste with lots of music\nand dancing, but it has already had\na lot of positive reviews following\nthe first screenings in Caan. Look\nout for Kylie Minogue popping us as\na fairy! A few weeks later sees\nSteven Speilbergs new film Artificial\nIntelligence (Al). Starring Haley Joel\nOsment (Sixth Sense) as an android\nin the 21st century, this promises to\nbe a real treat. And then before you\nknow it, it's12 th October:^American\nPie 2 and the beginning of term.\n\u2022 i Screen \u2022 27th June 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

    "content": "Thankyou and goodbye\nAs the sun streams into my office I recall\nthe last time I switched my office fan on\n(during July last year), and I find myself writing my last ever column for Felix - my\nfirst one being a few years ago in\nNovember1996 in my former guise\nas 'Westminster Eye'. It's the end of\nanother year for the student population at Imperial and for some the end\nof some of our time at Imperial College.\nWhen I first started at the Union\nknew I was taking over an organisation of immense variety and complexity with clubs and societies spanning\nan unparalleled breadth of activity. I am still learning about other activities\nwe do today. I remember a carefully-phrased set of general policies from\nmy election campaign including bring-;;\ning decision making closer to s tul dents, negotiating constructively but firmly\nwith the College and considering the Union's role in a multi-campus College. I admit I 've\ndone some, had others do some for me, and\ndone less ff Sometimes on A others n and sometimes aspect of n my job this frustrating\nyear which separates it from other Union posts is the amount of time negotiating with\nthe College. I don't and never did think they\nwere there to conspire against students - I can't believe someone would take a senior\njob in a university who did. However, I have\nlearnt that there are a variety of individuals\nwithin the College from those who see the\nstudent view as integral to how they operate\nto those who know better than us more lowly\nbeings on what is best for us. This has been\nsometimes illuminating and sometimes frustrating. It is satisfying to see a College-wide\npolicy change as the result of your input on\nwhat's best for students, less so when people consistently refuse to discuss an issue\naffecting students with you in the hope of\npresenting some fait ac comp li at a later\ndate, or because they can't imagine students\ncould make a useful contribution.\nHaving said that, the College and its staff\nare normally very keen to help students in\ntrouble and, curiously enough, one of the\nmore depressing and surprising aspects of\nthis year has been the unwillingness of many\nstudents to approach the Union when they\nare in trouble. There was even a student living in my own halls of residence who did not\napproach me for a month because she assumed 'I would be too busy too deal with\nby Hamish Common\nPresident, Imperial College Union\nit'. This is ridiculous! Ev if you were never\nici cu our v^o uj keen on us social scene 01\nclubs and societies the Union is always there\nto help when you're down, have problems with College, landlords, staff, others tul lumina ting dents, or even if you99 s ions next year on how it deals with the\nCC Us in the light of this new faculty st ruc ture.\nLast of all, I would like to acknowledge the\n| residents of L instead Hall, which I have spent far too little time in this\nyear, even though I apparently live\nthere: thanks naturally goes to the\nwarden ing team and re-apps including Chief Sarah, Clare of Bradford,\nScary Clare, Less scary Emma, Industrious Babs, Rebecca & Mischa\nthe Imposter, Alistair, Sandy and any\nothers who shouldn't take offence I can't recall their names. Thanks too\nto my landing neighbours Tom, Andy\nand Sacha, plus Brad and Rik who\neffectively lived there and together\nhelped re-invigorate my faith in the\nfuture of the medical profession whilst taking up much of the Linstead\nnetwork bandwidth on gender specific anatomical research.\nGood luck and good bye!\nHamish\nwant to chat.\nIt would be difficult\nto talk of the College and its staff without mentioning the new Rector, Sir Richard Sykes. Despite initial\nfears expressed by\nmany students that he\nwould attempt to turn\nit into a student less research institute, I have found Sir Richard\nto be genuinely concerned with student issues and as interested in quality teaching\nas he is in quality research. And he does\nplan to keep us all here\nfor the indefinite future! The new faculty\nstructure, though the\noriginal plans were done without meaningful consultation with us\nshould certainly benefit taught and research\nstudents in the long run.

    "content": "screen Shrek Another Life\nDirector: Andrew Adamson Starring: Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy When I started doing film\nreviews for Felix, the only\ncomputer animated feature film\nwas Toy Stoy. Since then, a whole\nnew genre has spawned with the\nadvent of big flashy computers and\nthe company Pixar, who are\nresponsible for both Toy Stories\nand the excellent Antz. The computer generated film goes to a new\nlevel with the jaw dropping Final\nFantasy, released this summer, but\nyou can read more about that in\nthe Summer preview.\nShrek is Pixar's new offering and is\nmade with the same verve, which\nmade their previous offerings so\nsuccessful. Cleverly they have\nonce agian realised once you have\na good story, with interesting chara ct ers, the humour and flashy graphics part of it polish off the\nentire thing rather nicely.\nShrek is a quiet ogre (voiced by\nMike Myers), who wants nothing\nmore than to be left alone in his\npeaceful swamp. However, the evil\nprince Farquaad banishes all of the\nfairytale characters from his kingdom to Shrek's swamp, much to\nour heros annoyance. To rid his\nhome off all these irritating and\nbadly behaved lay about s(I mean\nthe wolf from Little Red riding\nHood is smoking in his bed!) he\nmust find the prince a wife. Off\nShrek goes with his goofy donkey\ncompanion( voiced by Eddie Murphy) to find the enviable Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so\nthat the prince can turn Shrek' s swamp back to its original tranquil-lit y. This film is very funny indeed, not\nonly because of the pur ile burp/ fart humour for the young\nchildren (and men) but also the\nmore sophisticated jokes aimed at\nthe more ses i ble members of the\naudience (women). In the main line\nof fire is Disney, with the film being\nvery cynical to all things sugary\nand sweet. There are numerous\nsend ups with quotes and mis-quotes from famous films. My favourite is The Matrix piss take\nand also the interrogation of a gin-ger bread man, all involving the\nprincess character.\nShrek is an excellent film which will\nbe lauded for months to come.\nShrek is out on Friday.\nDrew\nDirector: Philip Good hew Starring: Natasha Lee, Nick Moran and loan Gruffudd Another Life is yet another Brit\nfilm, which unlike the vast majority is actually pretty good.\nHowever, it is not based on drug\ndealing in Swansea or anything\nelse along those lines, but\nEdwardian England. Which is why,\nunfortunately, no-one except your\nmum is going to go and watch it.\nThe story is based on real life incidents surrounding Edith Thonpson,\nwho was hanged in the late 1920's for her part in the murder of her\nhusband, Percy, by her lover\nFreddie Bywaters. All the evidence\nat the time, and this film, is made\nsympathetic to her involvement in\nthe crime. Bywaters himself admitted to the crime and in his last\ndays protested Thompson's innocence ultimately in vain.\nThis film essentially follows her\ntragic life from before her marriage\nprior to the First WorldWar up\nuntil her final day on death row.\nNatasha Lee puts in a very good\nperformance as Thompson, whom\nwe are led to believe is an outgoing and fun loving women restricted\nby both her husband and so ce it y. Moran plays Percy, a totally different role from the character he is\nbest known in Lock Stock and Two\nSmoking Barrels. However, he fails\nto find his feet as much as the\nother actors, and along with a rather daft accent, can be consid-ered at best adequate.\nNonetheless he puts across the\nmain point of his character, that of\nbeing a charming teenager who,\nthrough his old age becomes an\nintroverted and oppressive to his\nwife.\nGruffudd, who plays Bywaters is\nexcellent giving a dashing and j extrovert character a rather sinister side. The chemistry between\nhim and Lee is also worthy of note,\nas it is their characters relationship\nwhich is the driving force of the\nfilm. Although their chemistry\ndoesn't light up the screen it is\ngood enough to be plausible.\nThe film follows quite a long period!\nof time, at least twenty years and\ndirector Good hew must be commended for letting the film run its\ncourse and, while not showing a high degree of flair, doing a solid!\njob re a creating an English tragedy.\nAnother Life is out now.\nDrew I \u00ae Screen 27th June 2001 \u2022 Felix\n\n"

    "content": "Image Issues\nIC is often perceived as being full of geeky guys. How true is this, and what effect is it having?\nFelix asked these girls what they thought...\nTOM BAILES S What is the first thing you think of when\npeople talk about IC? World-class technical institution? Centre of cutting edge research? Or just a place full of geeky guys?\nThese things may be true, and I have no problem with the first two, but the last is a worry.\nWhether it is an issue depends how seriously\npeople take it. I 've had the good-natured ribbing from friends back home, but that's just\nannoying, rather than a major problem. When\nyou start to think that is how IC is perceived by\nthe majority, it makes you sit up. What surprised me is how almost every university guide\nfrom The Guardian to Virgin Student all make\nsome reference to it. Felix has set out to find if\npeople were worried about this image, what\neffects it has on them, and whether indeed they\nthought it was a bad thing at all. When thinking\nabout who to ask, we thought it best to start\nwith people who are being most unfairly tagged\nwith the \"geeky guy\" stigma, that is, people who\nare most definitely not geeky guys. What's the\nopposite to a geeky guy? Why, an outgoing,\nconfident, young woman of course!\nWe found some volunteers for this task and\nasked them what they thought. To give a face to\nthe voice, we decided to take some pictures to\ngo with it. I hope that these contrast with typical\nideas of the IC geek.\nLaura, Medicine\nWhen you think of IC, do you think there is a problem with its image? I'd say yes. There is a lack of females, apart\nfrom in medicine. People know about that lack\nof females, and I think they draw their own conclusions from it.\nI think there are more geeks at Imperial,\nbecause you have to be quite intelligent to get\nhere, and also we don't have any arts subjects.\nDo you think that defines a geek? That, and someone who keeps themselves to\nthemselves, and doesn't social is e, people who\nkeep their heads down. It's really nothing to do\nwith being good at your work. It's like they don't know how to communicate, they are just\nobsessed with their work. I think some people\nresent others like that, because they are good\nat their work\nDo you think being a geek always has negative implications? I think it could have positive implications - it\ncould mean that you are a really hard worker,\nyou're dedicated to your work, but that could\nalso show that something is lacking, like you\ndon't have any social life at all.\nHas IC's image had any consequences on you? Not really, no. I think it does mean that the\nmedics tend to club together. That is a bit of a problem, but I don't want to be a part of that.\nDoes it matter that IC has this image?\nYeah, to a certain extent. I think people do go\nelsewhere for social events. There is a stigma\nattached to Union events.\nAre there any girls you would call geeky? Not here, I have to say. I do know some, but I haven't met any at IC. It's very hard to label\nsomeone.\nDo you think the image of IC is wide-spread? No, not really. I think it's more of an internal\nthing. People just think that things are better\nelsewhere, when really it's not.\nKatie, Biology\nWhat do you think about the generalisations that people make about IC? There is an enormous mix of people here. There\nare people from council estates, and I know\npeople who have millionaire parents. One of my\nFeature 27th June 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

Recreational Clubs Committee Colours Awards Announcement Tuesday night we paid homage to the individuals within the recreational clubs committee who have gone above and beyond in the name of their club. Whilst we, the executive, have tried our best to encourage, support and represent you over the course of this academic year, we wouldn't be anywhere without the skill and manpower that each individual member invests in it's club or society. We have been impressed with each and everyone of you and, whilst everyone has made different contributions to the running of their club, only a handful are awarded colours each year. Inevitably, there are people who may have been overlooked and, no doubt, some of you will disagree with\nour choices. But, the important thing to remember is that you don't need a certificate to prove your value to a club.

    "content": "who go out drinking, and pretend they never\nwork for exams. Those sort of people piss me\noff. They think you're sad just because you\nwork. We're privileged to be here, so people\nwho think it's not cool to work for your degree\nare the ones who are most likely to label people geeks.\nSo do you think it's more of an internal problem? Medics tend to be rude about others like engineers or physicists, saying \"Oh they're so\ngeeky\", it's ridiculous, especially at our age, but\nthey do.\nWhen one of my friends came here, she\nsaid \"Oh my God, it looks like a factory where\nthey keep all the people working in their laboratories under the street\", so when I came I was quite relieved to find people were normal.\nI think if someone was shallow enough to\nbe put off by the image, then they probably\nwouldn't get on very well here anyway.\nCould the geeky image be seen as a good thing? The word geek is a derogatory word, so I don't think it could ever be used in a positive way.\nNow that I 've been here for a while, I forgot\nabout that whole geek thing, and reading some\nof the uni guides reminded me of it. When I was applying to un is, it did say stuff like that\nabout IC, and now I think it is such a pile of\npoo, because it's just not true, and people here\nknow that. I think it is important that people\noutside IC realise how unrealistic it is, so that\npeople aren't put off coming to IC, and so that\ngirls in particular aren't put off coming here.\nKelly, Physics\nWhat do you think about IC's geeky image? I admit that I have complained about the number of geeky guys. There is blatantly a lot, but\nthere are a lot of other people too. In general, I don't think people are completely geeky. They\ndo have different interests.\nWhat is age ek?I think a geeky guy is someone who is completely obsessed with their subject, and does-n't think about anything else. I know people\nwho, in between lectures, they talk about lec-ture s. They come down the Union and they talk\nabout lectures. That's not a bad thing. It just\nseems there's not much more to them apart\nfrom what subject they do, and what they\nknow about that subject.\nIC's image could put people off coming\nhere if they think it is going to be really boring\nsocially. When I first came here, it was a bit\nhard to find people with similar interests to me.\nI 've made loads of friends through RockSoc\nthough, so it's just a matter of making an\neffort.\nIn the last couple of years it has got a lot\nbetter. The number of girls on my course has\ndoubled.\nThere are many views here, but ultimately, it seems that the problem of\nIC's image is as much to do with attitude than any real issue. From all of\nthe peoples' views that are expressed here, one thing's for sure is that there\nare lots of ways of looking at it. The\naim of this feature is to promote disc us sion of these issues, and I hope the\nopinions here have gone some way towards that aim. A BIG thankyou to all the girls who\nvolunteered to help out with this fe a ture, and for being so much fun to work\nwith. I hope you all liked the photos!

Ably supported by two\nother impressive - though slightly strange - acts, they put on a show worthy of a homecoming\ncelebration.\nSupport came from David\nKitt, a young Irish singer and\nguitarist. He was accompanied\nby a woodwind player who we\ncould hardly hear ( actually I don't think his mic was turned\non) and a bearded guy who sat\ncross-legged on the floor, playing a miniature keyboard. Strangely, the percussion was all recorded - maybe the drummer couldn't make it. Despite\nsome overly long tracks with\nexaggerated endings and perhaps trying too hard to sound\nlike David Gray, Kitt and his colleagues came up with a thoroughly promising slice of folk-pop.\nWe were then treated to a completely unexpected but\ntotally enjoyable performance\nfrom an African drum troupe,\nbefore the main event began.\nTurin Brakes kept a packed\naudience involved, interested\nand excited throughout, playing\ntracks from their recent LP The\nOptimist and some new material\ntoo. Even though the set lasted\nfor over an hour, the band maintained interest with variation in\nall the key musical areas. The\nbassist, drummer and keyboard\nplayer occasionally sat out, leaving the two original band members to perform some of the\nslower, more reflective tracks,\nnotably the excellent Futureboy.\nPredictably, it was the\nband's most familiar track, the\nrecently released single The\nUnderdog( Save Me), which provoked the biggest audience\nreaction. Less predictably, the\nlive version was even better than the single - this was much\nappreciated.\nA great live band, Turin\nBrakes' rise to fame is sure to\ncontinue. They come highly rec-om mended. Dave Edwards\nSwell\nEverybody wants to know\n(Beggars Banquet)\nIt's still called Swell, but the band is\nnow reduced to his singer/compositor\nDavid Freel (as written in the sleeve\n\"guitar, keyboards, vocals and other\ncrap\"), helped on half of the songs by\nthe drummer Rey Wasam. This sixth\nalbum (some songs of which are from\nthe recent EP \"feeds\") sounds like all\nSwell's stuff: an acoustic background,\ntrans pierced by electric loops, with this\nparticular voice like a haunting lament.\nBut it's darker and with less detach-ment: the songs are good, but their\nhypnotic construction now sometimes\nsounds repetitive, guitars are rougher,\nthe singing deeper... This general\nblackness looks like a disillusion -except on a few songs, on \"like p over ty\" or \"... a velvet sun\" the magi is still\nefficient.\nThe reduction of the team is maybe\ndue to the world indifference that had\nto face the band for almost ten years,\nand that's a shame as these lo-fi and\nc harmful tunes can be captivating.\n\"Everybody wants ...\" is a pleasant\nalbum and I 'll give it three points, but I highly recommend the excellent 41 and\nToo Many Days Without Thinking ones,\nand hope that Swell will one day earn\nthe little success they deserve.\nV/A Brassic Beats Vol.1\n(Skint)\nThis is a real Classic Originally\nreleased in 1996, Brassic Beats introduced the world to the Skint sound,\npioneers of Big Beat.

    "content": "EXPERIMENT DECLARED FAILURE\nImperial College School of Medicine has been\nexperimenting with a new brand of medical education over the past three years. The course is one\nof the very few in the country where students get\ninto hospitals and see patients from day one. The\nfirst three years are spent concentrating on the\ntouchy feel y aspects of medicine such as communication skills and empathy. Medical learning during these first three years is relatively limited,\nmuch is expected to be self taught, and is examined by trivial multiple guess quizzes, and of\ncourse the infamously ridiculous computer based\nstatistics test with online help. Following the entry\nof the first wan n be doctors to undergo this course\ninto their clinical training ICS M have realised that\nthe approach taken to their education in the first\nthree years has left them ill-prepared from the\nmore traditional second half of their training. In an\nincredible move course directors at the medical\nschool have decided to accept that their experiment has failed, and are set to make changes to\nthe current course to give students a more rigor-o us, traditional education in their formative years\nat the school. To save face it is planned that these\nchanges will be introduced gradually over the next\nthree to five years.\nLONG TERM ASPIRATIONS\nICU's new President Sen Ganesh has been planning his entire life around getting the sabbatical\nposition for the last few years. Sen completed his\nundergraduate degree in the year in which Hamish\nCommon was elected President. It is now\nbelieved that Sen did not stand for the presidency\nat this time as he came to some sort of agreement with Hamish. In order to be eligible to stand\nthis year Sen has spent the last year at Imperial\ntaking an MSc course which has involved him\nrepeating large chunks of the fourth year of his\nundergraduate degree. The year was not entirely\neffortless though, he is thought to have done one\nor two modules for the first time. However, as one\nA mostly libellous column. Kevin is a random entity who knows nothing about\nnothing\nof his 'very good friends' is thought to have\nalready completed these coursework heavy courses this may come in useful.\nINSTANT NOTES It is likely that by the start of next year course\nnotes from MIT will be available online for a wide\nvariety of subjects that are taught at Imperial. The\nscheme, known as MIT-OpenCourseWare, the\nscheme is designed will serve as a model for university dissemination of knowledge in the Internet\nage. In the Chemistry department staff have\nalready been looking at MIT's offerings, and were\nworried by the possible implications. One lecturer\nwas wondering how they could justify the tuition\ncost of their courses now that lecture material\nwas available in a superior form for free.\nSUCCESS BREEDS SUCCESS Following the huge success of Idris Harding and\nhis team's Imperial College Summer Ball college\nhas given the go-ahead to another massive student run event to be held in the college. The\nRCSU's Beer festival was this week given the go-ahead by head of catering John Foster on behalf\nof the College, who were particularly impressed\nby the quality and speed of the cleanup following\nthe Summer Ball - the Great Hall was back in its\nexamination room format by nine o 'clock Sunday\nmorning, just five hours after the event closed.\nThe Beer Festival has in the past been one of the\nlargest and most enjoyable RAG events, and will\nprovide a popular and highly visible core to RAG\nactivities next year. The event, which will feature\nthe drinking of a huge variety of exotic Beers,\nCiders and Largers will be held on the afternoon\nand evening of Wednesday the 6th March.

Mr Pollard\nI Exec that Felix could lose up to \u00a340,000 this\n;r unless something was done. This figure was I disputed by anyone present,\nMr Clifford had not been told I;ha discussion was being| I Mr Pollard' s main concern j fie from Felix' s invoicing of\nler tis ers, with approximately\n,000 of invoicing still to do at\n\u2022 time of Exec. The figure of\n0,000, which he spoke of\nma Mr Clifford for, was j arent ly based on no further\nDicing, no advertising in the\ntwo issues, and Finance fee failing to collect any of\nmoney Felix is owed from\nJertising. Although the job of invoicing is down\nhe Felix Editor, with advertising in student pub-t ions invariably carried out on credit, credit\nItrol is handled by the Union's own finance art ment. In a meeting which took place later\nMr Clifford told Felix staff, \"This bizarre figure\na sed on obscene incompetence from all parties\nol ved... it's a shame no-one asked me about it.\"\nfe added, \"The main problem isn't sending out\nDices for this term- most issues have been paid\nwith profit from earlier terms, which was all\nlo iced and should have been paid by now. Our lies t problem stems from Marchfirst.\"\nBarchfirst was a multinational strategy consul-icy company, which essentially provided man ment advice for Internet start-up businesses,\nrough it survived the \"bursting\" of the \"Internet\ni ble\" fairly intact, the company later ran into\nj lem s when its CEO, Joe Firmage, announced\nbelief that all human technology was derived\nj m aliens. He later left in order to set up a pub-Joe Firmage: Alien\nli shing company in order to further his beliefs.\nIt was the start of a downhill spiral for Marchfirst, whose European arm finally went bust\nlast month, and employees in several cities broke\ninto the company's offices in order to reclaim possessions and obtain severance pay. At the beginning of this year, Marchfirst took out a series of\nfull colour, full-page advertisements in Felix, but\nlater claimed that they would be unable to pay until\nMr Clifford explained why the adverts were about\ntwo shades out (although most people could notice\nany difference). Unable to do so, and aware of\nMi's problems, he sought the Union's advice, who\nrecommended he offer them a\" substantial discount\". Despite this, M1\nare still believed to owe Felix around\n\u00a33,000 for October's advertising, and\nFinance Office are pessimistic about\nthe chances of any money from the\nreceivers.\nMr Clifford denied that he was at\nfault over March first, but did admit\nthat he had got behind on invoicing\n\u2022 this term, which he attributed to \"Felix\nHH| Editor in Summer Syndrome\"; too \u2122 much to do, too many people doing\n\u2014 exams. The \u00a38,000 backlog of in v oic \u2022 H BB Hmg was cleared during the eight days\nconspiracies Felix was suspended, he added, and\nhe expected that Felix would receive all the money\nit was owed, assuming no more companies went\nbankrupt. Exec ordered that Mr Clifford cleared\nthe entire backlog of the invoices before Felix be\nallowed to go to press this week.\nFelix staff were described as feeling \"frustrated\"\nat having a weeks' worth of work go to waste, and\nall felt that if Exec or Mr Pollard had a problem\nwith their editor's conduct, they should be able to\ntalk to him face-to-face rather than making decisions behind closed doors.\nFollowing the reinstatement late last week, shortly before Etienne left for his holidays, Mr Clifford told staff, \"It's a shame that Felix, which\nhas always looked for transparency and fairness in\nthe Union, should be treated like this. If you have a problem with someone, you should be able to talk\nto them about it rather than making allegations and\ndecisions behind peoples' backs. As well as making\nus miss an issue, it reflects pretty badly on the\nwhole Union.\"\nContents \u2022n mer Ball rot fcs& any !ote news we might\nInsurance and genetic testing\nFelix 121 1 Cover image: Tom Bailes s.q nd goodbye ff om him\nDoes imperial hove a geeky,\n: . . \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ; \u2022 .

Films with\nsingle scientifically worded\ntitles, should be approached with\ncare. As everyone knows they can\nbe good (The Matrix) or more likely\nthey can be bad (The Cell).\nEvolution has good credentials. For\na start it is directed by Ivan\nReitman, one of the most successful comedic directors of the\nI980's. Secondly it stars Julianne\nMoore, fresh from the success of\nHannibal.\nHowever it stars David Duchovny,\nthe man who will be forever known\nis Fox Mulder. The mentality\nbehind him starring in a film, I really\ndon't understand. For the last\ndecade almost he has been investigating aliens in the X Files.

The military are then called in to stop the\nevolution under the watchful eye of\ngovernment scientist Allison Reed\n(Moore).\nUnbelievably this film was actually\nwritten as a Sci-Fi thriller.\nHowever, when the director has\nfilms such as Ghostbusters II and\nTwins to his credit, you know that\n'thriller' is possibly used in the\nwidest sense of the word. In fact, if\nit was a thriller, it would have been\nabsolute shite and not worth\nwatching. Instead it is merely a comedy of the nature of Reitman's previous projects. The humour isn't groundbreaking and the performances range from average through\nto shocking.\nAll in all it's a run of the mill film\nHollywood film.

At the time, most of College were\nware that he suffered from the rare cond i|n, but his repeated attacks, which could\nlast up to a week, soon made it\nevident that something was seriously wrong.\nIndividuals with Portillaxis are\ncapable of living well into old age,\nwith Lord Te bb it, Baron ness Thatcher and Ian Paisley being\nwell known sufferers. However, victims live with the permanent\npossibility that an attack can be\nfatal- either to their careers or\ntheir lives.
