    "content": "FELIX11 TOUCHSTONE\nThe Influence of Politics\non Technology\nSpeaker: Paul Johnson\nPaul Ek pen yong THE FIRST Touchstone weekend took place last weekend at\nSilwood Park. We left IC on Saturday afternoon by coach at\napproximately 2.20p.m. from Beit Archway and arrived at Silwood\nabout 3.30p.m. We then deposited our overnight bags in the huts\nwhere we were to sleep and proceeded to tea.\nThis was followed by the\nlecture given by Mr Paul\nJohnson, ex-editor of The New\nStatesman (he now devotes\nmost of his time to writing and\nis the author of The Offshore\nIslanders, Journey into Chaos,\netc) on 'The Influence of\nPolitics on Technology'. This\nlasted for an hour and was\nessentially an historical outline of instances where\npolitical motive was the\ninstigator of technological\nadvancement, whereupon an\ninsurgent discussion followed.\nWe adjourned for sherry and\nthen sav our ed the app et ising Silwood cuisine.\nThe participants then\ndivided into three groups to\ndiscuss five questions posed\nby Paul Johnson, viz:\n1) Should Government try to\ninfluence the development of\ntechnology?\n2) If so, what is the best way?\n3) Is technology likely to\nflourish more successfully in\na democratic or a non-democratic society?\n4) Should Government be more\npreoccupied with theoretical\nscience, advanced technology\nor intermediate technology?\n5) What role should scientists\nand technologists play in\nGovernment?\nA general consensus of opinion\nwithin each group was app-r opiate d to be presented at\nfull session the following\nday. A piss-up (on one pint!?)\nthen followed.\nWe staggered out of bed in\nan intellectual stupor and\ngro ppe d our way to the dining\nhall for breakfast. Those of\nus who could brave the stormy\nweather went out for a walk,\nwhile the sensible people\nfollowed such intellectual\npastimes as snooker, bridge\nand darts.\nEveryone paid a visit to\n'The Canon Inn' prior to lunch.\nA final meeting of all those\nattending was held, whence\nthe scribe rs from each subgroup presented their reports.\nMr. Johnson then, summed up\non all the reports with more\nquestions from the floor and\nthus ending an intellectually\nstimulating and enjoyable\nweekend.\nThe following five replies\nrepresents fairly the outcome\nof the debate on the questions\nset:\n1) The Government should\ninfluence the development of\ntechnology in one way or\nanother.\n2) The Government should\nallocate funds for theoretical\nscience research and leave\nthe choice of field of research\nto the scientists concerned.\nThe accent now should be on\nadvanced technology for this\ncountry. For the third world\ncountries intermediate technology should be given\npriority. It is also noted that\nthis field of research has to\ndate received little attention\nand is under estimated.\n3) The speaker failed to agree\nthat there was no distinction\nbetween democratic and non-democratic governments in the\nway research is followed\nthrough. The general feeling\namongst the group being that\nefficiency was more likely in\na non-democratic state since\nwhatever project they were\nlikely to research into would\nbe bulldozed through in no\nuncertain manner.\n4) The choice of the field of\ninvestigation is up to individual governments which\nis limited by the amount of\ncapital they possess.\n5) The group felt that scientists\nand technologists should have\nonly a consultative role in\ngovernment. The speaker\nthought that there was a strong\ncase for representation of\nscientists and technologists\nin the cabinet. They should be\nmore involved in the decision\nmaking process, i.e. be in an\nexecutive position. But, he\nnoted the fact that scientists\nand technologists in general\nwere not interested in politics,\nand tend to leave all decision\nmaking to politicians. They\ntended to behave like the\nforces, in the way that they\ncontract out of politics. They\nare out of touch with the\npolitical situation in general.\nThe speaker conceded that any\nscientist who entered politics\nand in so doing relinquished\nhis scientific research could\nno longer be classed as a scientist.\nRIFLE CLUB IF YOU happen to be one of the rare breed known as\nfemale: why haven't you joined the IC Rifle Club Ladies\nteam?

Articles,\nfeatures and small advertisements\nseemingly flood into the FELIX office\nand we simply feel duty bound to print\nthem all. That means more space is\nrequired;. the production takes longer;\nfolding and collating takes longer.\nThat means nauseating pain for the\nFELIX staff. In order to lessen the\nburden on the staff somewhat, we are\nnow looking for someone, preferably\nwith little or no experience, who, after\na period of training, would take on the\nresponsibilities of Technical Manager.\nThe job is principally confined to\nThursdays when FELIX is (only just)\nproduced.\nCome on, you people out there!\nSurely there are some of you who get\nthe Thursday blues and want to get\ninvolved in something worthwhile.\nBetter hurry if you want your name\nengraved on the FELIX Staff Presentation Pot. And surely the post-college advantages must surely speak\nfor themselves.\nWith reference to the much talked-about 'Chem Eng Joke?' article in the\nlast issue, we have received absolutely\nno indication whatsoever as to who\nmight have been responsible, so the\nwhole thing may, inevitably, have to\nremain a mystery. Needless to say, we\nhave received confirmation to the effect\nthat Miss Georgina Greene (Secretary to\nProfessor Ubbelohde who is at present\nthe head of the Chemical Engineering\nDepartment) does infact ride a bicycle.\nIt seems that the Union General\nMeeting held yesterday made more than\none person angry and disgusted due to\nthe large amount of time which apparently had to be devoted to discussion\non the motions which the Union will\nbe contributing to the NUS Conference\nto be held at the end of this month\nat Margate. It is clearly understandable\nthat people will become impatient when\nan agenda essentially gets commandeered by one set of issues.

I do feel that the\nliving conditions in the camps\nshould be much improved.\nWho remembers the original\ncivil rights movement? The\nnearest to realisation that the\nideals of that movement have\ncome was the Tory inspired\npower sharing executive,\nwhich was supported by many\nsocialists, myself included.\nThis is why Ulster is kept out\nof party politics, I therefore\nobject to the content of part 2,\nparagraph 1, it is divisive.\nMilitary presence is necessary\nuntil Ulster is politically\nstable. Bombs and bullets\nachieve nothing except murder,\nthe problem must be solved by\nsocial understanding, and the\naims of the original civil\nrights movement must be\nachieved.\nr as\nBy way of an after thought,\nEnoch Powell's presence in\nUlster may be benefit us all\nshould his career be prematurely\nended by an acute case of\nlead poisoning, although I would rather he just retired.\nYours,\nRupert Harper,\nMech.

Anyone saying this in the Union would\nbe told he was a fool, a*t rog or a xxxx. But a similar remark\nabout, say, modern art, would hardly raise a murmur. I am not\nhere to defend modern art, but more to attack the anti-intellectualism that allows such remarks to pass unchallenged.\nA few years ago I subscribed to the 'I know what I like'\nview, but I decided to find out why the 'classics' have been so\nhighly rated for so long. I found the Iliad boring because over\neight hundred pages were just description of slaughter. But most\nof the others I read from Xenophon to Koesler, were s uprising ly Interesting. This maybe because the author was not trying to\nsett a million paperbacks, and so not restricted to boring plots,\nlifeless styles and utterly predictable endings. After this brief\nexposure to 'literature', I began to find S.F. boring and badly\nwritten, so I tried to analyse why. As a result I can begin to\nsee what a book is really about, and how and why it was written.\nI wandered through the halls of a few art galleries to see if\nI could make sense of modern art. Some were self-explanatory\nthe rest were incomprehensible. Last year I went round part of\nthe RCA exhibitions, and, with the help of one of the students,\nand the drawings and photos of some others, I began to see what\nthey were trying to say.\nA friend from the RCM was talking about 'Mahler expressing\nhis spirituality through his music', but he knew what he was\ntalking about, and it wasn't rubbish. Now, when I see send\nups of people who 'try to express the inner meaning', I realise\nthat these are only funny because the writer of the send up\ndoes not know what he is talking about. Recently people have\nbeen telling me that I am an intellectual. I protest that I only\nread the books for fun, but they say that that is what being an\nintellectual means. I must admit that people who say 'You\ndont't have to know what it means if you like it' annoy me. My\nmate John did. He has started reading Aldous Huxley for 'fun'.\nI'm told it takes several pints to acquire a taste for Guinness.\nDOMINE, DIRIGE NOS\nGod perceives our thoughts and leads us\nTo a thinking silence where\nWord is given work awaits us\nThrough the love revealed by prayer.\nThen at awkward times He calls us\nWith an urgent, muted sigh;\nTells us where a task awaits us;\nEven gives us faith to try.\nSo it seems that mystic instincts\nMake us take some strange and odd\nPaths that lead to troubled pre c in ts Where there's hidden work for God.\n\u00a9 N.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT\nRUGBy CLUB\nThe rather improved health\nof the International XV took\na tum for the worse last\nSaturday. With its engine only\nrunning on thirteen cylinders\nand only the forwards playing\nin their correct positions, the\nseemingly impossible happened, when they lost to an Old\nCooperians team. The forwards,\nby their own confessions,\npossessed the unfit test front\nfive ever fielded, but despite\nthis they gave their all and on\npractically every occasion,\npushed the opposition clean\noff the ball in the tight scrum s. In this department full credit\nmust be given to the 'mature'\nsecond row of Andy Clapham\nand (Dv.) Ken Weale, along\nwith the fine efforts of Ryan\nBeddoes as pack leader.\nThe IC team took to the\nfield after an hour (or more)\nlong coach journey and we\ncertainly were, by no means,\n'warmed-up'. During this\nperiod Cooperians scored two\ntries. Or at least the ref.\nthought they were tries, but\nthen he didn't know enough\nrules to know any better. Thus\nat half time we were trailing\n8-0, but were looking forward\nto playing down the slope in\nthe second half.\nThe second half saw IC\nfirmly embedded in the Old\nCooperians half. In fact, so\nmuch ball was won from scrum\nand line-out, that IC should\nhave scored many tries. In one\nsuch situation, a line cut\nonly one yard short of their\nline was won by IC, and Ryan\nand Andy drove over for a try\nwhich was disallowed by the\nreferee, despite being a perfectly good try.\n'The A's never lose \u2014\nspirit' is the phrase of the\nmoment, and certainly they\ndidn't. From a penalty attempt\nclose in, Rob Jones hit the\npost, and by quick passing,\nJon Pitcher scored in the\ncorner, Rob Jones failed to\nconvert.\nThe last few minutes were\nnow upon us and this period,\nalthough not producing any\nfurther score, saw much\ndetermined effort from the IC\nteam. In this category Ned\nmust deserve a special jj jen tion for his covering and attacking flair. All in all IC were\nunlucky to lose to this team,\nbut despite this we all had a good time afterwards with\nRyan leading the choir in the\nbar. The irony of the occasion\nwas that the Extras had no\nopposition tum up, and we\nfirmly believe that with fifteen\nmen we could have won.\nAnyway next Saturday we\nhave arranged a game with\nBelsize Park and all those\nwho played last week will\nget a game, so pla as e turn up\non Saturday, lads.\nTeam: A. Davies; J. Pitcher,\nNed, S. Dobson, J. Marklew,\nR. Neal.R. Jones; C. Cuthbertson,\nFred, R. Beddoes, K. Weale,\nA. Clapham, R. Sutton.\nHOCKEY CLUB\n6 - aside IC v POTTERS BAR This annual event took\nplace at Motspur Park last\nSunday. There were five teams\nentered from Imperial \u2014 two\nfrom ICHC and one from each\nof the constituent colleges.\nDespite the inclement weather,\nrepresentatives of four of the\nsides (RSM didn't turn up so\nRES played their matches)\narrive ld at the appointed hour,\nto meet up with their first\nshock \u2014 the water hockey was\non with swimming trunks and\nflippers provided. Eventually\nenough players arrived for the\ntournament, to start. The\nconstituent college teams were\nall knocked out in the first\nround league matches. IC (I) comfortably won their league\ndefeating Kings (I) by 2-1\nwith goals by Dave Lord and\nBob Middleton; RSM by 1-0 the\nscorer being Trevor Clarke;\nand drawing 0-0 with Royal\nHalloway. IC (II) had more\ntrouble. After losing their\nfirst match against UC (II) by\n0-1 they turned on a devastating\ndisplay to beat Royal Dental\nHospital 2-0 with goals by\nChris Hodge and a Trevor\nClarke penalty (Yes, the\nmasochist did play for both\nsides). Thus, we qualified on\ngoal average. Thanks to the\nluck of the draw IC (I) had to\nplay IC (II) in the quarter finals\n(fix shouted the crowd). Bob\nMiddleton soon put IC (I) ahead\nbut Jeh Bashar equalise d from\nthe penalty spot just before\nhalf time. The second half\nwas scoreless resulting in\nIC (II) going through on short\ncorn a js. In the semi-finals,\nBans (I) proved too strong.\nThey scored an early goal and\ndespite exerting heavy pressure\nIC could not equalise. Bans\nran out 2-0 winners by converting a penalty in the second\nhalf.\nEveryone appeared to enjoy\nthemselves despite the weather\nand special thanks must go to\nJim Marshall, Richard Cameron,\nDave Balderson, Keith\nArrowsmith, Ian Read and John\nAndrews for their umpiring\nTeams: IC(1) - Jim Marshall,\nKeith Arrowsmith (Capt.),\nTrevor Clarke, Dave Lord,\nBob Middleton, Trevor Tutu.\n1C(1I) Roger Hutson, Richard\nCameron, Trevor Clarke/Ken\nRowlings, Chris Hodge, Jeh\nBashar, John Andrews (Capt.).\nWho was the bd who\nasked a poor defenceless\nfresher to guard the valuables\nbox and then left him to stand\nout in a violent hailstorm\nwhilst he stayed in the dry\nalong with the rest of the team.\nThat is what is called devotion\nto duty.\nWithout ever quite reaching\nthe heights of last Wednesday's first half display IC comfortably\nwon this important league\nmatch last Saturday. This was\na better overall team performance with good displays\nfrom everyone in the side.\nOnce again IC provided the\nearly pressure and soon\nopened their account with a good goal from Bob Middleton.\nplaying steadily IC scored\nthree more times before half\ntime through John (O. A.P.) Andrews, Trevor (Superstar)\nTutu and Dave Lord, the last\none of these being a glorious\nshot into the roof of the net\nfollowing a long comer. IC\nmaintained the pressure after\nhalf time but did not get the\nluck (or the ump in ng decisions). Bob Middleton added another\ngoal midway through the half\nto ensure that IC ran out\neasy 5-0 winners.\nTeam: Roger Hutson, Jim\nMarshall, Richard Cameron,\nTrevor Clarke, Tim Hanson\n(Capt.), Keith Arrowsmith,\nDave Lord, Trevor Tutu,\nBob Middleton, Jeh Bashar,\nJohn Andrews.\nUmp: Chris Hodge.\nSTOP PRESS\nInstitut I'ran cais mascot stolen, il xe ed ly by H6I-.U,1n lex andre1 is a eddy near.

They regard it as\nan unnecessary expense which\nwould be detrimental to the\nenvironment in the area where\nthe college would be built and\nan uncertain gain for the loss\nof student dwellings its\nconstruction would entail.\nFor the first time ever the\nVice Chancellor has agreed to\nt meet student representatives\nito discuss the matter.\nEDINBURGH\nSome 50 Edinburgh students\nhave occupied a second house\nin the city to draw attention\nto the plight of students left\nwithout accommodation at\nthe start of term. The house,\nwhich is normally used by the\nUniversity for administrative\noffices has been empty for\nmore than a year. An earlier\noccupation saw 60 students\ntake over a house formerly\nused by the Principal for\nentertaining prominent guests\nto the University. The Students\nRepresentative Council claims\nthat 250 students are without\naccommodation. The University\nauthorities have refused to\ncomment.\nRelativity in Eastern Philosophy Mike Baume RELATIVITY THEORY has given a new insight into the\nfundamental phenomena of the Universe. The exact and eternal\ntruths of Greek Philosophy with its three co-ordinate space and\nuniform, unidirectional flow of\nfour dimensional space-time,\nprobability. Time has become\nintegrated with three coordinate space and loses its\nseparate identity. A new\nco-ordinate system, which\ndepends on the position of the\nobserver for its description,\nis produced.\nThe linguistic and conceptual difficulties inherent\nin relativity theory makes\nattractive the possibility that\nits conclusion have already\nbeen expounded in a somewhat\ndifferent context by the\nEastern mystics. Thus, although\ngeometry was used to good\neffect in the East, it was\nregarded as a Ii mit ive extension\nof the mind. The ancient texts\nrefer to the inter penetration time have been supplanted by\ncurved space and statistical\nof space and time and the\nhigher centres of consciousness\nwith their eternal present.\nWhether or not the objective\nbasis of relativity theory and\nthe subjective basis of Eastern\nmysticism lead to the same\nphilosophical interpretation of\nthe Universe is difficult to\nascertain on the superficial\ncomparison available at present.\nA further development of this\nline of thought seems likely\nin the future.\nFritjof Capra is writing a book, 'The Tao of Physics'\n(to be published by Wildwood\nHouse, London in 1975), upon\nwhich his lectures were\nbased.\nWOT GRANTS CAMPAIGN?

The result of\ntheir effort is reproduced.^lew.- it is paragraph 53 of the\nThird Report of the Expenditure\nCommittee' on postgraduate\n(education which was published\nlast December:\n'53. The N.U.S. thought that\nall postgraduate grants were\nInadequate and that the difference between studentships\nand bursa ries were unfair,\nparticularly in their application\nto arts graduates'.\nPerhaps I am being unfair:\nperhaps Messrs. Jacks and\nRandall did put up an excellent\ncase on all aspects, of post r; graduate education and it fell,\non stony ground: perhaps the\nmoon is made of green cheese.\nThere were two, significant\nconclusions reached- by the\nCommittee:\n1) The financing of post j graduates should be by a basic'\ngrant supplemented by a loan.\n2) Overseas postgraduates\nshould pay, in tuition fees, th\" p full cost of their education\nand training.\nBoth these suggestions, if implemented, would seriously\neffect the financial position\nof PG's and represents \"a complete reversal in the\nphilosophy of higher education.\nThe report seems to be shelved\nat the moment but if its\nrecommendations are seriously\nconsidered in the future PG's' \"must ensure that they are in a much stronger position than\nthey are now.\nThe problem of PG representation at Imperial\nCollege is particularly acute.\nThe student body consists of\nabout 40% postgraduates, and\nthis of course means that 40%\nof Union funds come from PG's: so what do we get for our\nmoney? Nothing at all it seems!\nIndeed, the Union seems\ninsidiously reticent of our very\nexistence. There is no Union\npolicy on PG's. The Union\ntakes no part in negotiating\ndemonstrating rates or working\nconditions \u2014 this is left to the\nvarious departmental PGgroups.\nThe biggest insult of all is\nthe reluctance of the Union to\ngive the Post Graduate Affairs\nOfficer a seat on its executive.\nPG's represent 40% of the\nUnion and have no effective\nvoice in its running! A disgraceful situation.\nA considerable amount of\ntime and effort goes into\norganising good representation\nfor PG's. Up to now this has\nbeen done by the Post Graduate\nAffairs Officer and the enthusiastic members of the\nvarious departmental, groups.\nPete Canell\nTHE University of London-Collegiate Counci Is report on\npostgraduate demonstrating and tutoring rates (see FEUJt V November}'should be condemned as what it is - art attempt to\npreserve a pool of cheap-academic labour with London . University The hard work and organisation that won \u00a32 an hour in\n\"many \"London Corteges has\nv beer i crushed on the re com friend ation of a CVCP Committee\non which students were not\nrepresented.\nPerhaps we should be\ngrateful that the new basic\nrate for demonstrating (\u00a31.50)\nis tied to the lower end of\nthe Lecturers pay scale. The\nannual increase this provides\nis certainly an advance; what\nPGs should fight for, however,\nis an adequate basic rate.\nUnless NUS or AUT are\nprepared to represent PGs at\na national level it appears\nthat we must rely on local\norganisation.

These animals\nwhich included a wolf, a bear,\na lion, an ape and a teddy bear, a really ferocious\nand enormous creature at that,\ndescended upon the good\ncitizens of Chelsea and South\nKensington. The poor victims\nwere harassed, savaged, made\nto crumble in paralytic laughter\nand usually parted with some\nof their loose change as a result.\nThis money was then quite\nquickly and greedily gobbled\nup by the little red cans with\na white printed label around\ntheir middle that were being\ncarried by the keepers of these\nanimals. In some cases even\nby the animals themselves. All\ncredit for these incredible\nfeats must go to the teaching\nof the Royal School of Mines.\nFour of these creatures,\nthe lion, wolf, ape and teddy-bear proceeded down Exhibition\nRoad making grotesque noises\nand generally cavorting along\nthe pavement. Stupefied and\nfrightened tourists either\ndonated to the causes with\ntrembling fingers and a smile\nor made off in the opposite\ndirection as fast as their feet\ncould carry them. The children-on the other hand tried to\nkeep abreast of their paroxysms\nof laughter and looked on in a rather condescending manner,\nbefore extracting some loot\nfrom mum or dad to put into\nthe red cans.\nThus progress continued\nalong Sydney Street, then to\nKings Road (in the direction\nof Sloane Square), down Sloane\nStreet (a very good hunting\nground for the ape) then up\nOld Brompton Road (the\nofferings to be had here were\nrather exiguous) and back up\nalong Exhibition Road and\nthen finally back to the RSMU\noffice.\nThis circus parade netted\nthe RSMU approximately \u00a3220\ntowards their rag collection.\nTheir total to date stands at\n\u00a3707.\nPaul Ekpenyong\nAnother Mines Animal Rag Stunt\nPhotographs by\nDenis Alanach\n...\u00bb\n1\n1\nas\nmi j fm WB\nm1 \u00a7S mH Hi\nm \u2022\u00a9*\nm im\nWs\nmi mnm ww mim1i "

In a game\nthat never saw our team in difficulty, the lads eventually managed\nto put away 6 goals with oH t reply. K. Senkin was the outstanding\nfigure in the IC side with his\nRUGBY herculean efforts up front being'\nrewarded by him scoring a fine\nhat-trick. On the same day\nthe Seconds played the.Thirds\nin the League and this 'derby'\nlived up to its expectations\nin every aspect. The Third\nteam, true to form, out played\ntheir seniors on the day and\ntriumphed by the odd goal in\nfive so making it three wins\nout of their last four matches\nwith the Seconds.\nThe game itself started\nbriskly and evenly with neither\nside really being allowed to\nsettle down. An early mistake\nby A. Roberts gave the Thirds\nthe lead they wanted and with\nthe Second's defence still\nrecovering from the shock of\nbeing one behind the Thirds\nran in another. The mercurial\nSteve Gee, always looking\ndangerous up front, pulled\nback two goals from the\nSecond team making it 2 each\nat haft time. The second half\nsaw a grim struggle between\nthe Second team forwards and\nthe Third team defence, but\nthe gallant play by centre backs Hunter and T. Jones proved\ntoo much even for the skill\nand enterprise of M. Clark and\nT. Lindon who combined well.\nJ. Pedley added the finishing\ntouches by heading a splendid\nlast minute goal.\nOn Saturday the 1st XI\ngained their fourth successive\nvictory when they defeated\nQEC by the convincing margin\nof 4 goals to 1. Andy Baker\nhad a good game in midfield\nand the uncompromising play\nof our back four gave QEC\nforwards little joy. This game,\nhowever, will surely be\nremembered by the two\nmemorable goals scored by\nGlen Swaby, both outstanding\nindividual efforts.\nThe Second's scored an\nimpressive victory over LSE\nSeconds, 3-1, while the\nThirds again making use of a last minute goal drew 3-3\nwith QEC IPs. . I. Ponton,\nA. Goody and fitness fanatic\nJ. Hargreaves scored the goals\nfor the Third's. The Fifth's were the only club side to\nlose on that day, going down\n2-0 against Royal Holloway\nSeconds.\nOne final note, we are\ndesperately short of GOALKEEPERS and REFEREES.\nReferees are paid \u00a31.75 or\n\u00a31.25 depending on qualification with free tea and transport.\nAnyone interested in either\nof these should contact\nS. Bates, Maths III via letter\nrack or J. Thornback, Chem. PG.\nPutting aside our disappointing result of the previous Saturday,\nIC turned on a scintillating display of hockey skills last Wednesday.\nOur unlucky opponents were the fire y City University side.\nStraight from the bully off IC attacked with great skill and totally\noverwhelmed City. Goals were bound to come and soon the rout\nstarted. Despite some brilliant\ngoal keeping,\" IC found themselves 4-0 ahead at half time,\nthanks to goals from Bob\nMiddleton (2), Dave 'Scorcher'\nLord and Trevor 'Superstar'\nTutu, r Unfortunately, IC\nslackened off in the second\nhalf and allowed City to come\nback into the game. The IC\ndefence proved at times to be\nfragile and defensive errors\nallowed City to score twice.\nAt this stage the match was\nvery evenly Balanced, but a brilliant goal by Jeh 'Sleepy'\nBashar allowed IC to regain\nsome of the initiative and\nalthough City scored again,\nIC ran out easy 5-3 winners.\nTeam: Roger Hutson, Jim\nMarshall, Richard Cameron,\nChris Hodge, Tim Hanson\n(Capt.), Keith Arrowsmith,\nDave Lord, Bob Middleton,\nTrevor Tutu, John Andrews,\nJeh Bashar.\nSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS.\nThe College Archivist, Mrs. Pingree, would like\nto hold an exhibition of old scientific instruments\nnext term. If you have anything vaguely covered\nunder this title Mrs. Pingree will be very glad to\nhave you get in touch. Should you wish to donate\nany to the archives they will be well looked after\nand kept for posterity instead of mould e ring in\nunused cupboards.\nInt. 3041 College Archives.\nBruce Bradley\nIC took 'the scenic route North to Bedford on Saturday 2nd November to play an extremely strong Bedford Wanderers team;\nThe attitude of the players was one of som fe resolve but a distinct\nfeeling of awe and lack of confidence could be felt.\nThe match was very slow in gaining impetus and it was some\nten minutes before the first\nreal encounters began by\nwhich time the score was\n3 points all. Finney had\nconverted an excellent penalty\ngoal from wide out. During\nthis first half Bedford were\nplaying down the slope and\nthis was a definite help to them\nin sustaining territorial\nadvantage. At this stage\nBedford were slightly on top,\nand from two set moves tries\nwere scored by them near the\nIC posts. Both moves involved\nan inside thrust the first\nafter a scissors and on both\noccasions the IC defence was\ncaught flat-footed.\nDuring this half the IC\nforwards were growing in\nconfidence and eventually\nrealised that with a bit more\nwork they would gain the\nupper hand. Lipscombe at\nthe front of the line out showed\ncontrolled aggression and won\nmuch of the ball thrown to\nthis position.\nAt the middle of the line out Booth was under much pressure\nas Bedford had a line out jumper at both the fourth and\nfifth positions. Much can be\nsaid for his efforts though\nas he consistently won his own\nball and Bedford eventually\nresorted to throwing to the\nfront where Lipscombe in turn\nwas dominating.\nThe sc rummage was also\ndominated by IC with Hart and\nBradley proving strong scrum-ma gers and hard workers and\nAustin at hooker easily winning\nhis own ball and getting some\nagainst the herd.\nSeveral scoring chances\nhad been unluckily squandered\nby IC during this first half and\nit was a travesty of justice\nwhen half time arrived with\nthe score at 15-3.\nThe second half was one\nto break the heart of any IC\nsupporter. The forward\ndominance was completed with\nIC coming out on top in every\nphase. The forward rush was\nwell exploited and Sergot\ncompleted several thrusting\nruns up the centre of the pitch.\nSeveral promising three-quarter movements broke down\nat the vital stage but this did\nnot stop Williams on the rightwing having an outstanding\nsecond half. In fact it was\nBedford who scored all the\npoints from a goal, a try and\na penalty goal. The final\nscore was 28-3.\nThe match did much to\nestablish confidence in the\nIC side and as soon as a defensive system can be'\nwonted out this IC side will\nindeed be a team to be\nreckoned with. Every member\nis looking expectantly towards\nnext Saturday when we entertain\nHarlequins 'A' at Harlington.\nTeam: B. Finney, R. Stern,\nD. Shakesheff, A. Williams,\nR. Abel, R. Hughes, T.

With any luck it could\nbe the last as fate has been\nkind and not pitched us together in the Gulteridge Cup\nthis year. We can also only\nhope that the groundsman at\nShenley will continue with his\npresent attitude to our glorious\nclub.\nThe match followed the\nfamiliar-pattern of the last ten\n(at least) encounters. Complete\nforward domination by IC was\nmet by the ultimate UC answer-spoiling. They have bred the\nbest' spoilers imaginable with\nforwards blatantly off side in\nruc k and maul and backs\nconstantly infringing the\nvarious off side lines.\nIC started with a bang from\na Finney penalty and a brilliant\nindividual try by Bradley which\nwas go a led by Finney. But\nfrom then until the end, IC\nwere continually fouled up by\nthe UC defence, the match\nbeing too close for comfort\npoints-wise for most of the\ngame. Finney struck another\npenalty and Cresswell scored\nan un converted try during the\ndying minutes. The final score\nwas 16-3.\nTeam: B. Finney, D. Shakesheff,\nR. Stem, R. Abel, A. Williams\nR.

No. 368 FRIDAY, 8th NOVEMBER, 1974.\nTHE PRATT REPORT\nON TUESDAY night an emergency council meeting was held\nto discuss the Pratt Report. This is the report of a working\nparty set up in March to advise the Rector on the use of college\nfacilities by outside bodies.\nCouncil accepted much of\nthe report as it was the kind\nof policy that the Union have\nbeen seeking to have implemented for some time.\nCouncil agreed normal college\nuse of all facilities must have\nfirst priority and sought\nconfirmation this would include\nbookings by Union clubs and\nmembers of college. To\nfacilitate this it was proposed\nthat outside day bookings be\ndefinately fixed not more than\nsix months in advance. The\nrecommendation that college\nstrengthen links with the local\ncommunity was welcomed,\nprovided this meant all levels\nof the community.\nEspecially welcomed was\nthe recommendation that Postgraduate students should be\nallowed to remain in residence\nin halls all year.\nThe main point discussed\nby council was the recommendation of the appointment\nof a Domestic Secretary who\nwould co-ordinate bookings,\nbuildings, refectories,\nresidence and domestic matters. Managers in each field would\nbe responsible to him. Council\nfelt that one person should\nnot have so much power. It\nrecommended that a small\nexecutive committee be set up\nunder Chairmanship of the\nDomestic Secretary, to exercise\nthe major decision making\nfunctions.\nRAPE\nDEMO\nARRESTS SIX WOMEN were arrested\noutside the US Embassy in\nGrosvenor Square last week\nduring a demonstration in\nprotest of the sentence imposed\non a woman in America for\nshooting a man who raped her.\nInez Garcia had been\nsentenced by a California\nCourt to between five years\nand life. Ms Garcia is appealing\nagainst conviction and\nsentence.\nIn London police had\nasked the 25 women who were\ndemonstrating on a wide\npavement in front of the US\nEmbassy to move to a narrower\npavement across the road,\n'an they were causing an\nobstruction'. In reality this\nwas to preserve the dignity\nof the Embassy. Six women\nrefused to cross and were\narrested.\nOne woman reported that\nwhat made them especially\nangry was the Chief Inspector,\non being told the group was a collective and had no leaders,\npointed to one of the women\nand said 'You're the prettiest\ngirl \u2014 I 'll talk to you'.\nNice one Cyril!\nSTUDENTS have been occupying Liverpool Polytechnic for\n20 days this Friday, and as yet there have been no concessions\nfrom the Poly Governors.\nAbout 50 students moved\ninto Polytechnic premises\nafter a Uiion general meeting\non October 17th, and have\nsince been refusing admission\nto all academic and non-academic staff.\nThe students have laid six\nmain demands before the\nGovernors: The Governors\nshould\n1. take action to improve the\nstudent housing situation\n2. reverse a15% price increase\nin catering charges\n3. inject money into Union\nFunds by pressing for a larger'\nper capita subscription from\nlocal authorities\n4. not continue with a proposed\n33% increase in hall rents in\nJanuary\n5. provide a nursery\n6. improve the communal\nfacilities of the polytechnic.\nA spokesman said 'we\nchose these six demands but\nwe are really drawing attention\nto Education expenditure\ncutbacks as a whole'. A further\npoint in con tension if the\nDelany Report which recommended a lower staff to\nstudent ratio. The Union\noppose this, not least as it\nwould make 150 staff redundant.\nUnion President Steve\nByers said 'Many students\nhave become completely\ndisillusioned with the power\nstructure of the Polytechnic,\nwhich gives the students 2\nvotes out of 37 votes on the\nBoard of Governors and 2 voles\nout of 45 on the Academic\nBoard. I believe that most\nstudents have now realised\nthat if they operate through\nthe committee structure of\nPolytechnic they can get\nnothing done. Therefore, we\nare forced into taking direct\naction'.\nThis is the second time in\na year that Poly students, who\nfor the most part subsist on\nlower grants than University\nstudents, have occupied\npremises at the Poly. In\nNovember 1973, students took\nover the main administration\ncentre until the Governors\npromised to take action.

A significant\nalbum indeed.\nTriumvirat: Illusions on a Double\nDimple (Harvest, EMI).\nBASED IN Germany, Triumvirat are\nclearly going to go a long way if they\ncontinue to produce albums of the same\nquality as 'Illusions on a Double Dimple'.\nTheir style is in many ways similar\nto the Emerson, Lake and Palmer of\nthree years ago \u2014 imaginative, classically\noriented and melodically eloquent. The\ncomparison does not stop there \u2014 for just\nas Keith Emerson is the keyboard\nvirtuoso and guiding s pri it of ELP, so\nJurgen Fritz performs the same duties for\nTriumvirat. There is not one track which\ncould in any way be described there to\nfill the gap.\nIt is consequently extremely difficult\nto single out one particular section (the\nmusic is played continuously), but I think\n'Illusions' has a certain edge on the\nrest with its resonant grand piano,\nechoing percussion, a full orchestra\nthrown in and a Moog reminiscent of\ne LP's classic first album.\nThe second side, 'Mister Ten Percent'\nis just as good, with a phenomenal\npiano solo early on that will have you\ngroaning with appreciation. Don't just\nsit there, get it!\nKayak: Kayak (Harvest, EMI).\nTHIS IS the British debut album of the\nDutch-based group, Kayak. They have\nachieved what can best be described as\n'a professional sound' and it is easy to\nunderstand why they have such a large\nfollowing in their own country. The\nmusic they produce is in no way due to\nany gimmicky instruments; the only\nout-of-the-ordinary equipment they resort\nto are mellotrons and an accordion.\nThe first track of side 1, 'Alibi', is\ntypical of the whole album. It is fast\nand rhythmically well-adjusted. The\nprincipal vocalist has a voice very\nsimilar to that of Jon Anderson who is\npart of Yes, but this does not detract\nfrom the essential quality of the song.\nThe last two tracks of this side,\n'Mountain Too Rough' and 'They Get To\nKnow Me', seemed etched with that\nessential emotional ingredient, nostalgia.\nBoth are damn good listening.\nFlipping the record leads are to the\ninevitable conclusion that there are\ndefinite similarities between Kayak and\nYes. 'Woe and Alas' sounds as though\nit could have been cribbed from Jon\nAnderson's sketch book, though the\nlyrics are appropriately less we tont in us.&o jr. oo many aiD um s they leave the\nbest track till last 'His Master's Noise'\n(apparently dedicated to their Roadie)\nalthough less than two minutes long,\nhas a tranquil lull to it which transcends\nthe normal sort of corn. It sets the seal\non a fine album.\nTangerine Dream: Atem (Polydor).\nWEIRD MAN, real weird. Echoing\npulsations, rhythms, electronic feedback\nand reverberations reminiscent of early\nPink Floyd go to make up this Berlin\n'rock', (however, for this album that\nepithet seems a trifle invalid) band's third album, though it is the first to be\nreleased in this country. This record\nrepresents a stunning innovation in sound,\nabounding with atonal clusters which\ngently cascade and scatter in a myriad\nof notes. There are no words to. latch\nonto and few definite musical lines to\nfollow, but the resulting effect still\nmanages to retain a coherence of mood.\nSide 1 is the title track Atem(Breath),\nwhich is a heavily rhythmic aggregate of\nelectronic guitars, synthesizers, mellotrons and percussion. After building up\nto a noisy climax, the music folds into\na serenity of drifting sounds. The effect\ntakes a little getting used to, but is well\nworth the effort.\nSide 2 kicks off with Fauni-Gena and\nthe connection with nature and living\nthings is clear. Slow, fragmented melodies\ndrift over a staccato texture which sounds\nlike the incessant chattering of birds\nand a coo oia ted creatures in an Amazonian\nrainforest.\nThe final track of Side 2 Warm ia an\namazing mixture displaying all the\npossible textures available from a human\nthroat. Zaps, groans, grunts and screams\nare moulded into a kind of primeval\nmusic. The track develops in a percussive\nAndrew Osborne\nWet Willie:\n(Capricorn).\nKeep on Smilin'\nDOES YOUR local council recycle\nwaste plastic? Ours doesn't so it is\nwith some degree of guilt that I consider\nthe battered and forlorn disc, lying in the\nWinfield super et te waste paper bin, in the\ncorner, and reflect on the current\nresources crisis.\nThe record is Keep on Smilin' by Wet\nWillie. It contains soul music of no great\noriginality, and this is precisely my\ncomplaint about that whole genre: it's all the same. Even though this group\nuses somewhat non-typical instrumentation, such as electric trombone,\nthe sound they produce is remarkably\ntypical. Now, I 've often been told 'Yous\nwhite folks, you ain't got no soul' and\nthen assured that 'white music' lacks\nsome sensuality supposedly associated\n.with soul music. Maybe, but Wet Willie\nare a white band and their sleeve notes\nand their lyrics indicate that they believe\nthey do have soul. I'm not qualified to\njudge.\nHailing from Macon, Georgia, they\nsing; predictably about their home town,\nthe countryside, fishing, banjos and\nplaying crap. The first track, 'Country\nSide of Life', is funky, features electric\ntrombone and becomes boring after the\nfirst verse. The second track is the title\ntrack, their big hit single (so you've\nprobably heard it) and is nearly indistinguishable from the first track.\n'Trust in the Lord' is, as the name\nsuggests, Jesus jive and differs from the\nfirst two tracks only in its faster tempo.\nNext comes 'Soul Sister' which can\nonly be described as monotonous. Then,\njust as you're about to lose your temper,\nup comes 'Alabama', a ballad and a pleasant change from the rest.\nThus it was with some hope that I played the second side. You've guessed\nthe result. The first track is bad. The\nsecond track is the same as the first.\nThe th ffd track is the same as the second.\nThe fourth track is the same as the third.\nThe fifth track I never heard the. fifth\ntrack because as the fourth ended I finally cracked and, rushing across the\nroom to the Sounderama portable hi-fi\nwith detachable speakers, I seized the\nrecord and flung it to the waste bin.\nI wouldn't buy this record.\nUp Country (BBC Records).\nHOWDY p ard ner. Here's some sounds\nfrom the mountains and prairies, way\ndown south in Shephard's Bush. Some\nreal cotton pick en', foot t appin', hoot n' nanny music. Strange then, that all the\nbands are English \u2014 The Roger James\nGroup, Lome Gibson Trio, Redwood and\nThe Down Country Boys. Yah hoo o! It's finger pick in' good. Anyone considering buying this album would certainly\nbe put off by the thirty five year old hag,\ndressed 'up as a cowboy, leering out of\nthe cover;\nIf you asked my opinion, I'd say\n'Up Country'.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX<7 F Only?.\nKatie McKinnon\nTHE Australians have their Earls Court, the Arabs theirs\nQueensgate and the French their South Kensington. In fact, South\nKen. with its tree-lined boulevards, open-air cafes, chic french\ndress shops (ici on par le francais) and empty letter bins, might\nver v well be a little corner of Paris transposed into the heart of\nour dear city. If you happen to\nbe around at that unfortunate\nmoment in the afternoon when\nthe lycee (no us) lets loose\nits contents onto the unsuspecting public you might\nvery well wonder whether you\nwere walking down Cromwell\nRoad or indeed the Boulevard\nSt. Michel. Is it that unforgettable aroma of Gauloise,\nblack coffee and cheap french\nperfume which trails behind\nthem that reminds you of your\nlast holiday in Paris? Or is\nit the distinctive way they\nthrow their sweet papers to\nthe ground, the look of near\nregret as they gently force you\noff the pavement or the magical\nsound of a foreign tongue as\nthey bawl at each other from\neither side of the road?\nFor those of us at the\nInstitute immersed in this\nother civilisation from nine\nto five there is the problem of\nidentity, hereafter known as\nident it is. This is a nasty\ndisease caused by foreign\nbodies; it is most common\namongst those attending\nforeign establishments. Early\nsymptoms are a forked tongue\nthus enabling one to speak two\nlanguages at the same time\n(particularly useful at staff\nmeetings) though this does\ntend to make eating more\ndifficult.\nIn fact our college must be\nthe only one in the country \u2022\nwhere the union meetings with\nthe staff are conducted in\nfrench. At one particular\nmeeting we were discussing\nthe delicate problem of staff-student relations and the\napparent lack of communication\nbetween the two. The discussion however, became too\ninvolved for those of us on\nthe union to continue in french\nso we reverted to english\nwhilst the staff continued in\ntheir mother tongue. However,\nthey were no longer too sure\nwhat we were'talking about and\nthe meeting ended in the sort\nof uproar that must have\nreigned at the Tower of Babel.\nWhich all went to prove our\npoint.\nLack of communication\nbetween the french lecturers\n(who make up about 90% of\nthe staff) and the students is\nTHE big problem at IF.\nUnfortunately, most of the\nlecturers who come in have\nfull time jobs outside and\ngive only a few lectures a week. Very rarely do they know\nthe other members of staff let\nalone the names of their own\nstudents. One girl recently\nwent to one of her lecturers\nto tell her that after having\nfollowed her course for a year\nshe nevertheless had decided\nto give it up. The lecturer\ndidn't even know who she was\ndespite the fact that there\nwere only a handful of girls in\nher particular group.\nMoreover, some of the\nlecturers show an amazing\nignorance of the day to day\nBritish way of life. One can\neasily imagine that they don't have to say so much as a 'yes' or a 'no' from one end\nof the day to the other. They\nlive in a french orientated\narea, teach at a french es-tabl ish ment, work with french\norganisations and send their\nchi id ren to the lycee. There\nis nothing wrong with staying\nwithin one's own little\ncommunity whilst abroad (and\nthe British know all about that)\nbut there is nothing commendable in it either..\nHowever, it is easy to,\ngeneral is e, and one must admit\nthat there are the odd few who\ndo take an active interest once\nthey have been roped into\nsomething. We had a surprising amount of co-operation\nfrom the staff for last year's review and for our dinner\ndance, and even this term\nmany of the male staff have\nshown amazing willing to\ncontribute to charity by buying\na rag mag \u2014 could those centre\npages have something to do\nwith it? However, it is the\nday to day co-operation which\nis lacking. Last year the\nadministration admitted that\nour system of tutors, whereby\nstudents could discuss problems\nwith a specific member of\nstaff, was badly in need of\nrevision. This was because\nthe member of staff designated\nto each class was more often\nthan not unknown to them, and\nremained so for the entire\nyear. When we pressed for a system whereby the class\nitself\" appointed the tutor, we\nlittle realised what we were\nletting ourselves in for. The\nAdministration decided that\nwe were right, that we ought\nto have a tutor with whom we\nwere in frequent contact, that\none hour should be set aside\nevery fortnight to discuss any\nproblems and that a room\nshould be made available for\nthe purpose, and woe betide\nyou if you don't have any\nproblems! So now, whether\nwe like it or not, we have to\nattend a 'discussion class'\nevery fortnight regardless of\nwhether any problems have\narisen or not. Unfortunately\nproblems do not crop up so\nconveniently, and even when\nthey do, given a fortnight's delay they lose their sense of\nurgency. This system is less\nthan useless. The discussion\nLindsay Victoria Maxwell\nhails from the United States,\n(though there is little trace\nof an accent) and is at the\nmoment engaged in laborious\nthird year studies in the\nDepartment of Mechanical\nEngineering. She is hoping\nto promote some interest in\nthe art of making small items\nof silver jewellery by trying\nto start a Jewellery Soc.\nWe wish her the best of luck!\nPhoto by Ramon Newmann.\nKARDOMAH RESTAURANT\n81 Gloucester Rd. SW7.\nOpposite Tube Station.\nOpen 9.00 a.m.12.00 p.m. EXCELLENT FOOD - GOOD VALUE.\n5% Discount On Presentation\nOf Student Card.\nhour just becomes a general\ngrouse hour. But there seems\nlittle alternative. Our lecturers\nare rarely at the Institute, they\nare highly qualified, consequently their time is precious,\nand if they are to act as tutors\na certain amount of time must\nbe set aside for this purpose\nfor which they are paid.\nHowever, the Administration\nshould not be surprised at the\nlack of support this scheme\nhas so far aroused.\nIF's theatre visit last week\nproved to be a most interesting\nexperience. The theatrical\nmasterpiece in question was\nthe 'Rocky Horror Show'. If\none may judge by the expressions on people's faces\nas they came out one might,\nwonder how they managed to\nstay in their seats to the\nbitter end (we didn't). Much\nsquirming was in evidence and\nlaughter was of the embarrassed variety. If you do\nlike to see sheer unadulterated\nporn put to music then this\nis for you. Personally I found\nit most distasteful, so I suppose\nit's back to the draw.ing board\nand Mary Poppins.\n\n"

STOIC is also responsible\nfor the maintenance of these sets.\nProgrammes are made, and transmitted\nfrom the TV studio in the Electrical\nEngineering Dept. We hire the studio and\nthe equipment is operated by STOIC\nmembers.\nWhat is involved in the making of a TV\nprogramme? The person who initiates a programme is the producer. He, or she, is\nresponsible for everything to do with\nthe programme except the studio prod-uc tion, i.e. contacting people who are\ngoing to participate in the programme,\nbooking the studio, assembling a studio\ncrew and finding a director. The latter is\nin charge of the making of the programme\nin the studio. During the recording of a programme he decides which and what\ncamera shots are to be used and when,\nand for example whether music is needed\nor not. He also decides when the programme is to finish. For our main news\nprogramme, 'TOPIC, production meetings\nare held in our office in the Union building\nat lunchtimes on Mondays and Wednesdays.\nDuring these meetings ideas are thrashed\nout for inclusion in the next edition.\nIf you have any news which you think\nwarrants coverage please ring Int. 2853\nduring the above times. To cover outside\nevents we have our own portable camera\nand video recorder. At the time of writing the Union colour\nset is not in use. The reasons for this\nare twofold. Firstly, the set has been\nplagued by faults and is due to be repaired\nshortly. Secondly, the relocation of the\nUnion Executive Office at the beginning\nof term into what was the TV lounge has\nnecessitated the moving of the TV set and\nits bracket. The latter has yet to be moved.\nHowever, both STOIC cables and the down\nlead from the aerial are in position and\nhopefully it will not be long before the\nset is installed and working.\nLast term STOIC transmitted to TV\nA tense moment in the studios\nas floor manager Paul Jarvis\nstarts the count down.\nLEFT: YOU ARE WATCHIN STOIC\nColin Grimshaw at the\ncontinuity desk.\nRIGHT: Programme in progress Bill\nLovell behind the scenes.\nsets in the Southside Halls of Residence.\nHowever, the picture quality was so bad\nthat it was decided to abandon this scheme\nrather than rendering a picture that was\nunintelligible to the viewer.
