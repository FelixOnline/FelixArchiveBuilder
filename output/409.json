He had the\nsatisfaction of knowing that\nhe was beaten by two good\nmen; both are ex British Champions. Also, he avenged\nlast weeks defeat by Alistair Doyle, the University Captain,\nwho this week was slower by\n10 minutes.\nAlan Leakey once more\nproved that experience is\nmore important than running\nspeed by coming in 9 minutes\nclear er f Rob- Alt in son. The\ncourse was a fast flat one\nand Rob had plenty of opportunity\nto stretch his long legs. With\na bit more orienteering speed\n(rather than running speed),\nhe should soon be coming\nhigher up \u2014 Alan will have to\ndo some training Jo keep up!\nSteve Web.b could also be a force to reckon with in the\nfuture; he did better this\nweek pipping Pete Johnson\n\u2022by 5 minutes.\nJohn Gibbirfs, the club\ntreasurer, looked resplendent\nin his newly purchased\norienteering kit (he denies\nall rumours that it was bought\nwith club funds). He completed\nImperial College A's6 THE A's BADLY wanted to\nwin this game. The reason\nthey did not, was a depleted\npack. Four of the regular\nforwards had departed, for one\nreason or another.\nThe A' arrived at Harlington\nwithout a referee, the job\nhaving be^n declined by\neveryone who was approached.\nUC arrived with an extra\nplayer and suggested that\nhe should play for the A's while an A player refereed.\nSteve Downing readily agreed.\nHe had seen the snow and\nsuddenly the Idea of spending\nthe afternoon in a warm\ntrack suit over umpteen shirts\nHockey\n'Pros'\nAN OFFER to turn professional\nwas finally accepted by the\nfirst team forwards. The\nterms of the contract being\na pint of ES B for each win. Their minds and sticks were\nfurther concentrated by the\nknowledge that at any moment\nJaspar 'bites your bottom'\nCooke' s lucky shorts (used in\nkindergarten) might so constrict\nhis nether regions as to make\nhim e legible for the ladies'\nteam.\nA number of thrusts down\nboth wings, by the insides\nM Isles and A Ross, and\nthe wing-halves Kim \" Flicker\" Howden and J Andrews who\ndistinguished themselves\nin their ad riot distribution,\nonly produced Chas Hardy\nstyle finishing. This meant\nthat when the opposition\nmade their first attack and\nscored, IC had not yet troubled\nthe scorer. This is a not\nunfamiliar situation to the\nthe 8 kilometre course along\nwith Mike Welford and Len\nFaircett. Martin Kessler was not so lucky, getting\ntotally lost and only completing\nhalf the course. However, he\nshowed that his orienteering\nskill is not entirely absent\nby successfully locating the\npub before closing time.\nHe claims that if all the\ncontrols smelled of beer,\nhe'd have no trouble.\nFrom now on, the orienteering\nclub meets every Friday lunchtime at 12.30pm in Beit 57.\nThere will be a cheap bread\nand cheese lunch available\nand everyone is welcome to\ndrop in for a chat and a bite\nto eat.\nDavid Rosen\nUniversity College (III) 20\nappealed to him. That, however,\ndepleted the pack still further\nand was to ensure the A's downfall. While the forwards\nwere still trying to get them-selves organised UC scored,\nand they were to score again\nin the first half, but not\nbefore they coped with a lot of pressure from the A's. Half-time arrived with the\nA's10 \u20140 down.\nThere was a revival in the\nsecond half with the pack \u2014\nespecially the second row \u2014\nplaying better. John Fishburn\ntwice came close to scoring.\n(At half time it had been\ndecided to give the backs\nanother\nfirst team, and their response\nthis time was a revelation.\nA ball, from the defence\nto Bob \"where can I get my\nleg synchronise d?\" Middleton\nwas passed on to Trevor\nTutu, who found M Isles\nmoving cleverly into space.\nMike \"I can score from\nanywhere, but short-corners\"\nIsles had no trouble in going\nround the ful Iback and hammering\nthe ball past the charging\ngoal keeper.\nThe next goal came from a neat ball into the ' D'.

By the time the\nthirds arrived at their\ndestination, it had commenced\nsnowing and during the match\nthey were treated to flurries\nof snow, sleet and hail I Potters Bar 3rd XI stood\nno chance against the IC\nteam who proceeded to tear\nthem apart from the bully-off.\nWithin ten minutes they had\nc once ede da short corner. A good hand-stop by Nick Bell enabled Chris Parker to put\nthe ball in the net, and five\nminutes later, Nick scored as\nwell. Our latest recruit,\nlain Stirling, proved himself by\nscoring our third goal.\nThe second half was similar\nto the first but we scored\nmore goals. The first of these\nmore of the ball and so to\nexploit UC' s bad covering and\nthat proved to be pretty\nsuccessful.) UC scored a breakaway try. The ball went\ndown field leading to aru ck on the A's line. A UC forward\nexploited the lack of cover\nand scored. The A's fought\nback. Chris Becque worked\nhard and received his reward\nwhen he ran In a try from the\n25 (yard) line following a mistake by the UC' s backs.\nDick Pullen kicked the\nconversion. Dick had been\nhaving a good game at full\nback, kicking calmly under\npressure.\nThis was another disappointing result for the A's. If the\nforwards had been able to\nmatch the backs the A's could\npint\npockets Tutu refused to\nclaim for financial reasons,\ncame from a push in by John\nAndrews who played the\nball into Trevor Tutu's path.\nHe noticed the goal-keeper\noff his line waiting for the\ncross. The shot was deflected\nby the goalie's pads into the\nnet.\nCharlie \" Ballon Feet\" Brown couldn't let the game\ngo by without making a ghastly\nerror to eliminate his otherwise\nexcellent play, so he let in a short-corner. But such was our dominance, with Jim\n\" here I come\" Marshall\nmaking the overlap, Jaspar\n\" Geronimo\" Cooke' s voice\ngetting higher, passes going\nto stick, that IC managed\nto score three more times.\nTheir referee managed to\ndisallow two goals from\nTrevor Tutu,, and one from\nAllan\" Gum shield\" Brown. Potters Bar 0\nwas a penalty which Chris Parker managed to convert\n(unlike last week). The fifth\ngoal was put in by lain Stirling,\na player of sterling qualities. Our last two goals were scored\nby Paul Ku row ski, the second\nof these being an excellent\nsolo effort.\nAll through the game, Potters\nBar did not get a serious\nshot at goal thanks to a very competent defence. This was another well deserved\nvi story. The only grouses were\nthat no \" Jugs\" were scored\nand that the onset of cold\nweather had resulted in the\nreappearance of Chris Parker's deadly-smelling horse liniment.\nTeam:- N Harrison, P Nair,\nR Vaz, A Bell, C Parker (capt.),\nM Bachryoowski, P Kurowski,\nN Bell, I Stirling, E Reed.\nMore\nSPORT overleaf\nRugby\nDepleted pack rob's A's of a win\nwin\nPotters Bar crushed\nhave won.

THIS IS a series of talks\narranged by some of the\nwomen in college because\nwe felt a need to examine the\nreason for women's present\nposition in our society. The intention is to look at the\npresent and past situation\nof women, to see how it\naffects us, and possibly to\nsuggest what we can do about it \u2014 although this is not our main aim. The meetings take the\nform of a talk given by one\nindividual who has made a special study of the subject.\nWe do not pretend to be\nexperts, we just want to\nshare our interests with\nothers.\nWe shall be examining\nwomen and work, women in\neducation, in the family, in\nscience and technology, and\nin the church. We shall also\nlook at the historical aspects\nof her role and society, and\nher role in other societies. A full course outline was given in FELIX No.407. The series started off with\na talk by Dot Griffiths on\nSocial is ation and Male and\nFemale Roles, on Wednesday\nJanuary 21st. In this interesting\ntalk she outlined experimental\nbiological differences, emphasising the tenuous assumptions\nand experimental techniques on\nwhich they are based. She\nargued convincingly that the\napparent differences are\nbased on social upbringing\nnot on the actual sex of the\nchild, supporting this with\nexamples: one such as the\ncase of children mis categorized as male or female at birth,\nwhose whole behavioural\npattern changed on being\nreclassified. As a result of\nthis talk, a lively discussion ensued; we all thought that\nthe talk had been useful to\nus, and looked forward to the\nnext one. on The talks are open to\neveryone to attend, they\ntake place on Wednesday\nlunchtimes at 12.30 in the\nICWA lounge.

    "content": "mix An introduction to a discussion on the Origin of the Family, Private Property\nand the State by Frederick Engels.\nTHIS BOOK alms to show that the\nInstitutions of society are necessarily linked with its economic basis, because\nof this, both the family as we know it\ntoday, and the state have not always existed. Much of Engels' facts are\ntaken from LH Morgan's\" Ancient Society\"(1877). He begins by looking at the different\nkinds of early society and noting that\nthey are differentiated only by the\nmethods of production of food and basic'\nnecessities. There were three basic stages;*\na) Savagery \u2014 where people lived off\nnature as they found it, the only tools\nused were to help in hunting eg bows\nand arrows, spears etc.;\nb) Barbarism \u2014 the beginning of organised\nproduction of food with simple agriculture\nand domestication of animals (where\nsuitable animals existed);\nc) Early civilisation \u2014 a very great leap\nforward In amounts capable of being\nproduced. This arose mainly out of\niron in agricultural tools eg ploughs,\nwhich very much increased production.\nIn tracing the history of the family\nthrough these stages of society it becomes\nclear that the monogamous family has\nnot existed for all time nor has the\nsubjugation of women, inherent. In\nour present family structure.\nForms of the family, or more strictly,\nlimitations of peoples with whom sexual\nintercourse was permitted, initially\ncame about purely through the necessity to reduce inbreeding. Those tribes that\npractised such restrictions grew in\nstrength through natural selection. In\nthe very early stages marriage groups\nwould be ranged according to generations\nsuch that brother and sister would be in\nthe same group and able to have sexual\nintercourse but not parents and children.\nLater structures were more complicated\nwith gens (or extended families) within\na tribe based initially on \"mother\nright\". These gens consisted of descendants on the females side and sexual\nintercourse or pairing marriage was not\nallowed within them. Thus, one gens\ncould take partners from some other gens\nbut not from its own and because of\nthis structure the gens was regarded as\nthe immediate family. Thus a man would\nregard his sisters children as nearer\nrelatives that his own children, infact,\nas it was not necessary for paternity to\nbe known, descent was only recognised\nthrough the female line. I Within this system pairing marriage\nexisted but of quite a lose nature.\nMonogamy was not forced upon the\nwomen and a marriage could be broken\noff by either side with relative ease. Preparation of food, rearing of children\nand living accommodation were often\norganised com muni ally. As the means of agricultural production\ndeveloped into the stage of early civil iz ation, there became a surplus from\nproduction, over and above the basic needs for survival, and private wealth\nexisted for the first time.\nThe man had always been the one\nactively involved in production although\nbefore that time the division of labour\nbetween male and female had not been\ndegrading, it was merely a natural\noccur en ce. Now wealth became the\npossession of a man through production\nand he wished to pass this on through\nhis family to his children. Then came\n\" father right\" within the gens structure.\nA woman would leave her gens to marry\nand would as time persisted be required\nto keep chaste before marriage and\ncould be punished for adultery.\nProstitution and adultery (on the\npart of the male) however, went side\nby side with the monogamy. The\nmonogamous family, In many ways, was the greatest defeat for womankind\nbecause It degraded her to the level\nof a mere possession. The necessity to protect wealth also\nbrought about the development of the\nstate. Under the orr,a in s ation of barbarism\nall members of the tribe took part In\ndecision making, chiefs-would usually be\nfigureheads with most decisions collectively made.\nHowever, as uneven growth led to a few growing rich, often taking possession of the Jands of others, it lead to a stage\nin society when the wealth of the few had\nto be protected for the poor. This led to\na\" police\" force and other state\ninstitutions to be used, not for the\ncommon good, but to protect the pri vili ged within the society against the under-pri vili ged. This is a very brief sketch of the\nfascinating ideas contained in this\nbook. Engels draws on examples from\nAmerican Indians, Australian aborigines\nand from early Roman Greek and the\nGermanic tribes organisation.\nHe highlights how, as commodity\nproduction developed, economic forces\nand laws of production often seem to rule\nover humankind and looks forward to\na stage of society when humans will truly control their own lives \u2014 when\nthe family ceased to be an economic\nunit and becomes an expression of\n\" individual sex love\", when the state\nwill no longer be necessary as an organ\nof oppression of one class by another\nand all decisions on the organisation of\nsociety can be taken by communities for\nthe good of the whole community.\nMary Attenborough\nTHE OR EAT E5T SCANDAL IN\nTH4% HISTOR3 OF |.C HAS CoM\u00a3\nT \u00bb Uf> HT...\\ Well'- I think it 5\nterrible!\nIt s not good enough\nSpanner !

This M kl version made one\nalbum. Kings and Queens' did a handful\nof British gigs, one Stateside tour\nand then seemed to disinter grate, leaving\nonly Sister Jane and John Hawken to\np \"ick up the pieces.

Together\nthey managed to fo mia six-piece band to\nfinish off a second album that they\nwere recording when R elf and McCarty\nquit.

(ln c ident ly, the second album\nwas never released in the States).\nChanges\nBy now disenchanted with the band,\nHawken soon left to be replaced by John\nTout, who had been playing with an\nIrish folk-rock group. It was inevitable\nI suppose that Jane R elf too should\ndepart sooner or later into obscurity,\nand auditions were held to find a new\nfemale vocalist. The lady they chose\nhad for the last six months been singing\nin the Strand production of Showboat,\nher first professional gig. Immediately\nthe group realised that, potentially,\nher beautiful soprano voice might lead\nthem to the musical direction they had been seeking. Her name was Annie Haslam. The rhythm section then left,\nto be replaced by John Camp, erstwhile\nmember of Leapy Lee's backing group\nand Terry Sullivan, a drummer of great\npower and perception. This then, one\nmight have thought was the most stable\nline up the band was going to get \u2014 but\nno. Just before Renaissance were going\ninto the studio to record 'Prologue',\nMichael Dunford left, apparently to\nconcentrate on the acoustic guitar,\nalthough he still contributed to the\ngroup by way of composition.\nCrash\nThey found a fine new guitarist\nnamed Mick Parsons \u2014 who after celebrating\nhis new found job with the group, crashed\nhis car into a wall and died. 'Prologue'\nis dedicated to Parsons. There then followed a period with\nthe band using guitarist Rob Hendry, but\nhe didn't really fit in with the group's by now, defined musical ideology. At\nare hersal where Hendry failed to turn\nup, former member Dunford stood in on\nacoustic guitar and subsequently rejoined at the expense of Hendry. It\nis this line-up of Haslam, Tout, Sullivan, Camp and Dunford that has taken Renaissance through the last three\nalbums, and that which played last\nweek at Brunei University, where after\na highly successful gig 1 spoke to\nAnnie Haslam. Natural Progression I asked her firstly how she, thought\nthe music of Renaissance, had changed\nsince she joined the band. \"Before 1\njoined, the classical rock thing was\nthere. Bui their music was more bo roque, very flowery classical music, and we\nchanged it gradually into more dramatic\nmusic, more emotional music, cause\nthats the way we are as people. It\nwas just a natural progression. We\ndidn't sit down and think \"right we're\ngoing to play music like this\". When\nwe do an album every one is different.\nMy voice changes from album to album,\nprobably because I'm getting older and\nmy voice is maturing everything progresses\nnaturally. We don't force an ying because\nI think that's where people go wrong.\nGreat American Success\nTo give you some idea just how\nbig the group arc in the States; they sell\nout most places they play (particularly\nthe East Coast), last summer they filled\nto capacity Carnegie Hall three nights\non the trot..This with the Rollins; Stones\nplaying across town at the Garden . I wondered why America had taken to the\nband so readily, whilst their homeland\nhad seemingly procrastinated over the\nmusic for so long. \"At first the British\n14> Annie \u2014 the vocal instrumentalist\npress didn't want to know us, they\nalways had it against us\" she complained,\n\"because we weren't the original\nRenaissance\". I think it was Jan Akkerman who said that the reason why\nAmerica accepted European bands who\nstuck closely to their own musical\nheritage, was because they (Americans)\nhad no real culture of their own and\n-were willing to \" buy instant culture\". Did she go along with this thesis? \"Yes\nI think there might be some truth in.\nthat. They have no history, no real\nclassical roots to relate to bands like\nELF and Yes although\" she adds,\n\"they're much different from ourselves,\nhave these roots. All their bands sound\nthe same\".\nOrchestra\nThe Carnegie- Hall concerts were\nrecorded with orchestra for a double\nalbum that should be released sometime\nnext month. Having used an orchestra\non a number of occasions in America, it seemed odd that Renaissance hadn't lined up a prestige gig in this country\nusing one. where, incident ly, she prefers\nto work. \"We've been told that it's too expensive to do over here, but the\nthing is I don't really like playing with\nan orchestra. If you play with one you\nhave two or three days re hersal really\nto get it absolutely perfect and its got to\nbe perfect otherwise its not worth doing,\nand that costs an absolute fortune. It's very difficult. I mean they don't always\nplay in tune, if the hall is hot everything\n,goes out of tune anyway. I like playing\nwithout actually, I mean, it's a nice\nfeel but usually your on stage and you\ncan't hear them, and they can't hear\nyou. You're worried all the time if they're\ngoing to come in on time and in tune.\nIt's very difficult\".\nOld Grey Half Hour\nA quick look at the date sheet shows\nan abundance of University and College gigs. Presumably they still think there\nis a place for the college gig on the\nbig concert circuit, considering many\nbands have priced themselves out of the\nEnts Committees' budgets. \" / think\npeople should do them\" she emphasis,\n/ don t mind doing college gigs, you\nusually get treated very well, with a bit\nof respect\". While at IC the band are\nbeing filmed for the ' Old Grey Whistle\nTest'. Did Annie have an opinion on\ntelevisions only con tempor y music\noutlet? She thinks for a moment \u2014\n\"To tell you the truth, I don't like it.\nThere's no feeling in it. And when a group plays in the studio, thank God\nwe're not doing it in the studio, it looks\nas though you're standing in a telephone\nbox! The best thing about it is the\ncartoons, they're great\nBrunei Gig Renaissance that night had played in the College sport's centre, a large\nempty looking mass of brick work, not\none might think t% most idyllic of settings for the romanticism that is so profound in their music. However, the\nband adapted themselves well to the\noccasion and played with fine gusto, the\noverall sound being as good as that\nachieved in most concert halls of\ncompatible size. The songs played\nstretched from the early 'Prologue'\nalbum through to the latest Scheherazade'\nconcept. Starting with 7 can't understand',\nfrom 'Ashes are Burning', and including\n'Running Hard' 'Ocean Gypsy' and\n'Prologue'. The only notable om misi on was 'Mother Russia', in my opinion\ntheir best song. (Incidently, the song,\nwhich concerns Alexander So lz he nitz syn, had to be dropped at one of the Carnegie\nHall concerts when half the staff of the\nRussian Embassy turned up at the gig).\nAnnie \u2014 more emotional music\nVocal Instrumentation\nAs has been said before, Annie' s voice is used as an instrument rather\nthan just a method of reciting lyrics, often singing in unison with the\npredominantly Eastern European piano\ntechnique of John Tout. The up-front\nbass of John Camp was used also\nas part of the melody line, rather than\njust part of the foundation for the rest\nto build on. Indeed, on occasion he\nswamped the acoustic guitar playing of Michael Dunford. The swank drumming\nof Terry Sullivan, with its assured sense of space, is used to tasteful\neffect. He drove the band through the\nchanges of time and key. They were\ngiven a fine ovation by the sizeable attend en ce, and were brought back to\nencore with 'Ashes.are Burning'.\nAfter finishing off their present\nstring of dates the band are off on a European tour co-heading with Tomita\nfollowed, presumably, with another\nlengthy tour of America. Shuffle along to\nthe Great Hall on Saturday and catch\nthem while you can. Words Ian Morse\nPix Phil Dean\nRENAISSANCE are giving\na concert in the Great Hall\ntomorrow evening, so don't miss it.... The concert starts at 8.00pm They're even going to\nfilm it!\nJohn Camp\n\n"

    "content": "F[ UX\nThe Future of Postgraduate\n476 AD Fall of Romulus Augustus\n1876 AD Fall of Custer\n1976 AD Fall of Postgraduate Education\nEducation\nAN EMOTIVE start maybe, but what is it\nall about? Last year saw the release of,\nthree reports on Postgraduate education/ training by the S RC( Science Research\nCouncil), the CVC PL Committee of\nVice Chancellors and Principals) and the\nPEC L Parliamentary Expenditure\nCommittee). It is likely that these\nreports will be acted upon this year\nIf this action involves implementation of\nthe recommendations per se, then what\neffect will it have on our education\nsystem?\nThe debate in the Houses of Parliament\non the PEC report brought out many of\nthe old criticisms of postgraduate study,\nviz:( i) Postgraduate work is rarely orientated\ntowards the current needs of society or\nindustry;\n(ii) Postgraduates, especially in research,\nare educated too narrowly to be suited\nfor industry afterwards; and\n(iii) A loan financed grant system\nwould \" test the motivations of post-graduates\". The values of postgraduate education\nto the individual and to the education\nsystem were sadly under-expressed.\nA loan system would indeed test\nmotivations; 99% of PG s would be\nseverely deterred by the thought of\nentering the big bad world with a \u00a36000\nplus debt round their necks. Both the S RC and PEC overlook the\nfact that university research is the\nfoundation stone of our whole educational\nsystem which continually adds to the\nwealth of knowledge available to future\ngenerations.\nThe S RC put forward prosposal s for\nbroadening postgraduate studies and\neven providing a\" taught\" course to\npostgraduate level. They conclude from\ntheir statistics that since60% of science\nand engineering PG s finish, up in Government and Industrial research, these areas\nhave the highest demand for PG s and\ntherefore PG studies should be structured\naround the needs of these areas. The\nICU\nThe Academic Affairs committee\nsent a response to the S RC last term\ncont ruc t iv ely criticising the findings\nof their report. A response to the CVC P report is now being prepared.\nIC\nA College working party on postgraduates\n(with three PG members) discussed the\nCVC P report and came down in favour\nof reductions in the number of grants to\nincrease the value of awards. An alarming\nS RC also calls for an increase of the\nnumber of industrial co-operative awards\nat the expense of normal grants.\nA research student of the future may\nbe assessed on productivity rather than\nacademic gu ali fy and a project will need job/ cost justification rather\nthan educational merit. Surely all postgraduate education should be\nprimarily an education and not a vocational\ntraining nor a way of producing industrially\nuseful research on the cheap.\nThe CVC P report is a more liberal\ndocument and tries to cover the whole\nspectrum of postgraduate education. It\ndefends research against outside\nencroachment and calls for a higher\nlevel of grant for postgraduates (the\nlatter at the expense of the number of\nawards available). It attacks the present\neducation cuts but only in so far as they\nare affecting universities. It is about\ntime bodies like the CVC P put their\nfoot down with a firm hand to stop cuts in\nall parts of education. If these cuts\ncontinue it is unlikely that the availability\nand quality of education for our own\nchildren will be as good as it is now.\nThe CVC P also defends the differential\nof fees tor overseas students providing\n\" fees are not as large as to make study\nin this country more expensive than in\nEurope or America\". Some European\ncountries have no university fees and\nmany much lower fees with no differential.\nThere are many good arguments for all education being centrally funded.\nview for such a prominent research\nestablishment to take. It also remained\nnon-commit al on the subject of overseas\nstudents fees.\nNUS Sue Slipman (NUS National Secretary)\nhas had publicity this year o yer the\ndirection of a very small proportion of\nthe vast amount of work she has done for\nNUS. She has, however, been very\nactive in the field of postgraduate\neducation and is generally in favour\nof firmer and more concrete policy from\nNUS on Education as a whole.\nLast Friday, she chaired a meeting\nof the Postgraduate Advisory Group of\nwhich I am a member. We discussed the\nreports and the form of our response. Sue\naffirmed that it would be useless to\nsimply criticise the reports and that we\nmust produce a response laying down\nclearly student views on the whole\nfield of PG education and directions we\nwould like it to take. In short, the\nAdvisory Group is to prepare the NUS report on postgraduate education. Your\ncomments as PG s or prospective PG s would\nbe welcome.\n;i) Fight the education cuts. March on\nFebruary 27th to show that you wish\nto preserve and increase, for future and\npresent generations, the availability and quality of education.\n(ii) Support the campaign against the\npresent fees situation which causes hardship for many students and makes\nstudy Impossible for others. Campaign for\n100% central funding of education.\n(iii) Help NUS to prepare a reasonable\nand representative report by saying by giving your opinions.\nLastly: A thought for the day \u2014\n\" Knowledge is not a coin with which\nto purchase happiness but has happiness\nin d is so lu bly bound up -with it\" \u2014 AF Ho as man.

As mandated\nSir, \u2014 Mary Attenborough's letter in your ast edition,\nrevolved about two themes on\nwhich I would like to comment.\nHer two points were, (i) The need for an organisation to\nrepresent Student interests\non a national level; (ii)\nConcern of students about the\nworld situation.\nConsidering the need for\na national student organisation,\nwhen she says \"If you want\nto change anything at all, though, you must see the\nneed for a student organisation.\nIt would be impossible to\neven decide on the grants\nclaim...without some sort of\nnational coordination\". She\nmakes a very valid point.\nThere is a need for an\norganisation to represent\nSTUDENT INTERESTS at a national level. What is important\nis the definition of student\ninterests. In which areas should\na student organisation express\nits views on our behalf,\nand in which areas should\nits jurisdiction be curtailed?\nDisgust\nSir, \u2014 It was with great disgust\nthat I read your front page\narticle entitled \"Wonderland\nMascot ry\" in the last edition\nof FELIX( No 408). I refer\nto of course, the numerous\nfactual errors contained\nwithin it.\nThe idea was fh fact not\nmine as was stated! I was\napproached as to the possibility of a swop and subsequently\nas requested informed Steve\nBrightman (RCSU President)\nand asked for his comments.\nMeanwhile Steve Hoyle( C& GU President) was also informed\nand both presidents were\ngiven four days to think it\nover. As you can see it was\nnot just implemented but\ncareful consideration was\ngiven to the STUNT before\nwe went ahead, the opposite\nwas implied by 'your'\narticle.\nEventually both sides\nagreed leaving Richard\nGundersen (not Gunnersby and\nnot a Spanner Bearer)to final is e details of the swop. We\neventually met at 1.01 (46\nminutes late of the original\n12.15 deadline) as both had\nslight mishaps.\nI also find that certain\nparts of the ' TITBITS' article\nneed commenting upon. I am\nquite sure that the reference\nto Chalk ie White (RCSU VP) were most em baras sing to him,\nas he is 'in charge' of R CSU Ms Attenborough claims that\n\"If you don't want higher\ngrants, if you don't mind\neducational cutbacks, if\nyou don't care about the\neconomic situation in Britain, and if you don't care what\nhappens in other parts of the\nworld, you may as well leave\nthe NUS\". The first two topics she\nlists 1 believe are in the\ndomain of a national student\norganisation, whereas the\nlatter two are well beyond\nits bounds. A student\norganisation should look\nafter our interests as students,\nwe elect MPs to look after\nour interests in the field\nof politics. In fact, the whole controversy\nis about the POLITICAL VIEWS and POLICIES expressed\nby the NUS and NOT their\nactivities in other fields.

The new extension\nwill accommodate approximately\n70 students.\nStudent strike\nimpracticable\nAt the U GM on Thursday,\nthere were two main bouts\nof excitement, one when ICU President, Peter Teague\nannounced the \u00a3350,000\nwindfall, and the other when\nRSMU President, Nick Bradshaw\nput a motion to the meeting\nto proclaim City and Guilds Union a sub-committee of\nMines Union. Strike\nThe news of the extension\nto L instead Hall* came near\nthe start of the meeting, when\nCorrespondence received was read out. After this,. in the\nPresident's Business; Mr\nTeague received support from\nthe meeting to make overtimes\nto the trade Unions concerning\ndie Student Strike and\nDemonstration on27 th February.\nMr Teague stated that it was impracticable to attempt to\nclose the College without\nthe full support of the Unions on campus. Whatever the\noutcome of these talks, he\nstill urged as many students\nas possible to go on the\ndemonstration and work under\nthe IC banner which was\nrecently returned to die Union. Several motions, including those to be put into the next\nNUS national conference\nwere debated and eventually\ncarried.\nLively debate\nA lively debate was, however, precipitated by the\nmotion that full-time members\nof the NUS executive should\nbe paid a net salary equivalent\nto the Postgraduate grant\nwith usual DES allowances\nfor dependents. At present\nLondon-based full time members\nof the NUS executive receive\n\u00a33200 per year. The motion\nwas passed overwhelmingly,\nthe general feeling being that\nNUS executive members should\nhave a similar standard of\nliving to that of the ordinary\nstudent or postgraduate.\nAnother motion again passed overwhelmingly, was that on central representation of\nCollegiate universities. Fearing\nthat the system would be\nextended to London, the\nmeeting rejected the NUS executives decision that the\nCollegiate Universities of Oxford and Cambridge should\nbe centrally represented.\nDisband C&G Two other motions were\npassed, re-affirming ICU's policy on the National Secret\nBallot for executive members\nand on Overseas Students.\nMr Brayshaw then introduced\nhis motion to disband City' and Guilds Union, the motion\nwas stopped after Mr Steve\nHoyle, President C& GU, had\nsuccessfully challenged the\nquorum.

As stated to the NUS conference at Scarborough,\nEnd sleigh made a loss of\napproximately \u00a310,000 last\nyear. Following this, a drastic re-appraisal of\" company\nwas made, and the new policy devised. Realising that\nadministration was a large\nelement of cost in the labour-intensive insurance industry,\nthey streamlined their system:\nreducing' the number of regions\nin the UK to two; Glasgow London, and the rest of the\ncountry. They have also reduced the number of categories\nof motor vehicles. End sleigh have published a leaflet of\ntheir charges, enabling students\nto calculate their own premiums\n\u2014 this is unheard of for an\ninsurance company. The leaflet is available from\nany End sleigh office.\nThe new system will have\nno no-claims bonus, but a \"guaranteed bonus\", which cannot be lost if the policy holder has an accident. The bonus depends on the experience\nof the driver. If he has an\naccident, the premium will be increased under a system\nof surcharges, depending'\nupon where the driver has the accident (higher surcharges\nfor London and Glasgow), not\nnot where the vehicle is kept.\nThe six month \" policy is\nrun by End sleigh in conjunction\nwith Federation Mutual Insurance\nLimited, a reputable, forward-looking company.\nEnd sleigh, as insurance\nbrokers, issue approximately\n160 thousand policies per\nyear. Of these, about 40\nthousand are motor car policies,. However, the car policies make up 4 5 % of the total\nincome of End sleigh. The increase in petrol charges\nand road fund tax has resulted\nin 2 5 % to 30% of student\nmotorists selling their cars or\nsuspending their policies over the past year. Enthusiastic employees are hoping that\nthis new scheme, which they\nbelieve to be extremely\ncompetitive, will encourage\nstudents back onto the road\nif only for six months in the\nsummer.\nEndsleigh intend to continue\nwith their 12 months SunA lli ance scheme, thus giving\na choice to car owners. As with all End sleigh policies, the holder has to be a full-time,\npart-time or post graduate\nstudent.\nRejoicing at the opportunity\nto launch an original idea, the\nEnd sleigh staff treated them-selves to a press-conference\nat the Waldarf and a later,\nlower key affair for the Student\nPress at UL U Malet SU Activities in Hillel House\n1/2 Endsleigh Street\nTel: 01-388 081\nSun Feb1 st: Film\" Cabaret\"25 p with student card 8.00pm, Mon Feb2 nd:\" The Scope for\nReform in Jada is m\" with\nRabbi J Magonet and Rabbi J Rosen.8.00 pm.

Many students\nrely on this, especially those\nwith flats who can have their\nvacation rent paid for them.\nI want to emphasise for all those students who do not\nclaim this benefit that it is a right which you are all entitled.\nHow much longer this right\nwill remain is a matter of\nconjecture. Rumours have\nbeen rife for sometime now\nthat this provision will be\nstopped. Recent statements\npoint to the fact that it is now more imminent than before.\nWhy should students receive\nthis supplementary benefit?\nUnder the present grant\nconditions where a student is paid only for 30 weeks of the\nyear at the full rate, and\nreceives about \u00a370 to cover\nthe 22 weeks of vacation,\nstudents simply cannot survive\nwithout extra income during\nthose vacations. Now, I am\nnot against students working\nduring the vacations, as this\ncan provide useful experience,\nit is not possible however, to\nwork every week of all the\nvacations. I also feel that\nstudents should not be seperated\noff from the rest of the community\nand if they are unemployed\nthen they should be treated\nin the same way as anyone\nelse would be.I would therefore adopt the\nattitude that a student should\neither be paid for 52 weeks\nof the year, or should be\nsubject to the same rules as\neveryone else, that is, if they\nare unable to get a job they\nshould receive some support\nfrom the state. I hope that\nyou agree.\nWho wants a higher grant?\nThe answer to that question\nis probably that most students\nwant a higher grant. TheN US grants campaign has three\nmain fronts. Firstly, that the\nCarental contribution should\ne abolished because students\nshould be independent at\neighteen as is everyone else, and also it is the only way\nto ensure that every student\nreceives the full grant to\nwhich they are entitled.\nSecondly, that those awards\nwhich local authorities make\nat their discretion at present,\nshould be mandatory so that\nany student who is accepted\nfor a course automatically\nreceives financial support.\nFinally, the NUS are campaigning for an increase in the\nlevel of the grant of about\n33%. This increase seems\nmassive, but is necessary\nto give students the same\npurchasing power they had in\n1962. The grant level would\nbe over \u00a31,000 a year if this\nincrease were accepted by\nthe DES. To put this into\nperspective the . residence\ncharges at Westfietd College are \u00a3620 full board.\nI hope you will all agree\nthat although we should be\ngrateful for what grant we\nget, in a time of high inflation\nlarge annual increases are\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE OPERATIC SOCIETY PRESENTS\nUTOPIA LIMITED\nBY\nGILBERT & SULLIVAN\nTICKETS- FOYE'E OF SHERFIELD\nBDG OR UNION1230 \u2014I30 DAILY\nTIME-.

    "content": "mix Reviews Theatre\nRSC inject new insight\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company in \"Henry V\" at the Aldwych Theatre\nIS TERRY HANDS' production to constitute\nthe RSC' s last desperate plea to the\nArt's Council? It seems so, for as the\naudience arrive the cast are already on\nstage, dressed c asua i ly in track-suits\nor jeans and sweaters. They wave cheer i ly\nto friends in the auditorium or wander\nexpectantly up and down as though\nwaiting for the pubs to open. But this\nstark, static beginning serves to\nemphasis the splendour to follow. As if materialise d out of thin air by Emrys\nJames' friendly and persuasive chorus,\ncostumes and props gradually appear;\nfirst the gold casket, then gigantic\nmilitary equipment. A vast multi coloured canopy depicts the court scenes, then\nfalls to represent the grey battle fields\nof France... Visually impressive though the\nproduction is, the military and patris tic aspects of the play are toned down,\nin favour of a closer examination of\nthe King. Alan Howard's Henry is a young and inexperienced sovereign who,\nmindful of his past, has to strive to\ngain the trust of others. Great effort is\nrequired to sustain the veneer of\nkingship, and a number of lapses into\nself pity and loss of confidence occur.\nAfter Harfleur, Bardolph's execution\norder and the list of the French dead,\nwe see Henry almost completely drained\nof regal it y. Each time, however, command\nreturns almost as quickly a? it departed,\nand Henry resumes his role as king.\nAlthough little assistance is provided\nby Shakespeare's text, Mr Howard\neffects these and other subtleties very\nconvincingly. He possesses a remarkably\npowerful and penetrating voice, and\nhis delivery of the lines is riveting.\nThe success of any play cannot depend\nsolely on its central character; in this\nproduction the RSC as a whole are in\nexcellent form. TREVOR PEACOCK( Flu ellen), Richard Moore (Pistol) and\nGeoffrey Hutchings (Danphin) provide\nespecially illuminating performances,\nand the \" French\" scenes with Carol le Roussean (Katharine and Yvonne\nCoulette (Alice) are played with charm\nand delicacy. Peter Bourke, as the Boy\nachieves such a rare degree of communication with the audience that his death,\nalthough expected, comes as a disappointing blow.\nThis production richly deserves its\nwide acclaim. It provides fresh insight\ninto the writing of Shakespeare, and\nmust go some way in restoring loss of\nconfidence in the nationalised theatre.\nSteve Grove\nMusic\nBrain-damage\nHydra - Land of Honey (Capricorn)\nTHE POWER CHORD barrage of the\nfirst few seconds quickly puts you in\nthe picture as to possible brain-damage\nfor an unprepared listener to this waxing.\nThe opening couple of- sentences are\nneedless to say, the only intelligible\nones before the decibel ton-up is registered\non the old eardrum-o meter and from\nthen on, all you catch are the intermittent\nscreams of \" Little miss rock 'n roll\"( innovative, huh?) but the music \u2014\ngreat y, gutsy, rock of good quality \u2014\nis pretty interesting, even good for\nsuch a tired and overworked gan re. Hydra have certainly learned their licks well. Spencer Kirkpatrick, on lead guitar,\nis the central figure in dis'combo and\nworry though, ' cos the songs are strong\nenough, and are well enough played to\nmake it all worthwhile. If they can\n.reproduce anything like this live they'll\nr be worth s hak in' out yer s heckles for\nat the local Palais de Dance. Hydra emerged\nfrom the rough-and-tumble Southern states\nbar-and-club circuit around .1972 and\nsupplies the energy while the rhythm\nsection of Orville Davis (bass) and\nSteve Pace( drums) maintain a competent\nbackground driving force. The vocals ef Wayne Bruce are something else i hough, reminiscent of Edgar (or Johnny)\nWinter, ie pretty terrible and more than\noften sound painfully strained. Not to\nhave impressed enough people sufficiently\nsince then to acquire the services of\nthe Allman Bros producer, Johnny Sand I in,\nfor this, their second album.\nIt's all about the label really. When\nyou see a new release under the Capricorn\nmoniker you know what the game is \u2014\nyou'r in for some un comp rosing country\nor boogie, whether it's good or bad.\nNo deals. So, if Hydra can keep their heads\ntogether, they might inject a bit of\nbite into a currently easy prey \u2014 the\njaded rock scene of the moment. Shame\nyou can never get rock'n' rollers to\nwrite worthwhile lyrics, though. Part\nand parcel of the job, Is' pose.

You remember those\nfrightfully amusing Adl wych farces of the\ntwenties? Well, this is one of those,\nand it's a rattling good evening's. entertainment.\nIt's written on t ne traditional lines of\nfarce and not at all like those frightful\nmodern imitations with trouser less bishops coming from an interminable\nseries of bedrooms. You remember the\nold style sort of thing, don't you? Act I: meet the characters and assess the\nsituation. Act II the silly old as s gets\ninto hot water, though in this case its\ndashed near to boiling, and Act III: he gets\nout of it by the skin of his teeth.\nWhat makes this one so ripping is the\naddition of a crime, and a rea.Jly live body,\nwell a dead one actually; and then\nthere's a bit of d is inheritance and\nblackmail thrown in on the side, to add to\nthe fun.\nDinsdale Landen makes the perfect\nsilly old as s. On the stage I mean.\nHe' s D'Arcy Tuck, suitor to the disinherited\nJoan Hewlett. His interview with the\npolice at Scotland Yard is top hole\nstuff. And who'd 've thought that D'Arcy could be such a booby as to take a sniff\nof the knock-out drops intended for the\nvictim of the robbery? I mean to say \u2014\nWell, I jolly well do say what I mean\nto... say... yes, indeed.\nWho'de'you think is behind all these\ngoing-ons, what? It's that Frank Finlay chap pie; all Cassa nova and Hitler.\nNever seen such a crafty looking man in\nmy life, devious even. But will Mrs\nHewlett see through him as he eyes\nher valuable jewellery? No she jolly\nwell won't, because she' s a social climber of the first water. She's played\nby Dandy Nichols and I never knew a woman could be so fat; as D 'Arcy\nremarked, you'd need a taxi to get\nround her.\nThe play is full of topping ly funny\nmoments, but you, brought up on a diet of television comedy, might find the\nfirst act a bit hard going.

    "content": "8\nmix External Eclairs\nTHE MOST interesting thing to\ncome out of the C CU debates\non the NUS, was the consensus\nthat \" we must work hard and\ndemocratically to make NUS what we want it to be instead\nof sitting on our backsides\". So I hope that we shall see\nwell attended Union meetings\nto discuss motions and\namendments for NUS conferences, and a few more people standing\n'or conference delegations.\nNUS \u2014 no impact\nI was interested to read\nMary Attenborough's letter\nin The last issue of FELIX. I am sure that most students\nwould agree her statement\nthat our main need is \" an organisation to represent\nour interests and views at a national level\". But as Ri z Shakir said last week, the\nNUS has not had much\nimpact in the corridors of\npower. I would suggest that\nthis is because the NUS is\nnot believed to be genuinely\nrepresentative of students.\nIn order to give it real\npower, we must do three\nthings; (a) democrat is e the\nUnion at all levels, and that\nincludes democrat ising our\nown Union! (b) change the\nUnion from a federal structure\nto a union of individual members;\n(c) stop it wasting time and\nmoney campaigning on issues not of direct relevance to\nstudents; for example, international affairs, revolutions,\nand telling the Government\nhow to run the country.\nAll three are closely interrelated, and if we are\nnot prepared to work hard to\nachieve them, then we might\nas well join those Unions\nsuch as Manchester, St Andrews,\nSt Davids and Newcastle\nWho are expected to leave\nNUS very soon, and those\nsuch as Aston and Charing\nCross Hospital Medical\nSchool who have already done\nso. Some people are suggesting\nthat we set up an alternative\nUnion; but I think it is more\nrealistic to do something with\nthe one we already have.\n'Broad Right' needed\nThe only way that change\ncan be realised is through\nbuilding up a political machine\nas powerful as that of the\nBroad Left (the dominant\npolitical bloc in NUS), which\nis obviously not something\nwe can do over - night. In\nIn every college in Britain,\nCommunists and other Marxists\nwill have to be opposed in\nelections for union posts and\nfor conference delegations, by\nIndependents, Liberals and\nConservatives. These people\nmust then produce a network\nsimilar to that of the Broad\nLeft but working for a relevant\nNUS and through that a better\ndeal for students.\nDemocracy \u2014 two types\nFinally, I would like to\nsay something about the\nmeaning of \" democracy\". Essentially there are two\ncontradictory concepts which\nmust not be confused in\nstudent politics or elsewhere;\nfirstly, there is \" active democracy\", as advocated\nby Mary Attenborough and\nher party. In an \" active democracy\", all decisions are taken by \" activists\", that is, by meetings such as\nUnion General Meetings\nattended by a small proportion\nof the population. Hence it\nfollows that in a Student\nUnion, all officers would be\nelected by such meetings\nand could only act when\nEquality-what the law says\nWe may all know what\nhappened on 29th December\nlast year, but how does it\naffect us? Perhaps you are\napplying for jobs or for a postgraduate course or even\nlooking for somewhere to\nlive. If so, the Sex Discrimination\nand Equal Pay Acts could\nhelp you.\nEmployment and Advertising\nEmployers can no longer\ndiscriminate against a person\non the grounds of sex, either\nin recruitment or, if you get\nthe job, in training or promotion.\nRemember, discrimination\nagainst a person because they\nare married is also illegal\nin employment. Job advertisements that in any way favour\ninstructed by a meeting.\nIn opposition to this is\n\"representative democracy\", under which officers are\nelected by a ballot in which\neveryone may vote and once\n\"elected may take decisions on their own initiative. However,\nthe latter system does not\nprevent officers being\naccountable to a General\nMeeting, as is the situation\nat IC.\nAt many colleges, the\nsovereign body is not the\nGeneral Meeting, but a Representative Council on\nthe Parliamentary model.\nProbably such a council\nwould be preferable to the\npresent ICU Council which\nis mostly composed of officers\naccountable to a General\nMeeting. This is being\ninvestigated by the Working\nParty on Union Response. Whatever may be decided,\nI hope that the sovereign it y of the General Meeting will be retained, even if it is\nonly to be a safeguard, called in emergencies to debate\nspecific issues. one particular sex are illegal. There are a few mi nor except ion s. Men and women must be paid\nequally for doing the same\nor an equivalent job.\nEducation\nColleges, Universities and\nCoEd schools cannot discriminate in their admissions\nas from 1st September 1976.\nAccommodation etc.\nIn general, you may not\nbe refused a place in a flat,\nboarding house or hotel\nbecause of your sex. Neither\nmay you be refused service\nin a restaurant. In obtaining\ncredit facilities and mortgages\nyou must be offered the same\nterms as would be given to\nsomeone of the opposite sex.\nThe Equal Opportunities\nCommission\nThe Commission was set up\nas watch dog over the rein-for cement of the Sex\nDiscrimination and Equal Pay Acts. It is also empowered\nto make recommendations to\nthe government on \u2022 existing law. It will advise people of\ntheir rights and over major\nissues it may help an individual\nto bring a case. The Commission can set up its own formal\ninvestigations and, when\nnecessary, issue non-discrimination notices.\nBringing complaints\nThis can be done through\nthe county courts or by an\nindustrial tribunal in employment\ncases. Advertising complaints,\nare dealt with only by the\nCommission. Employment complaints must be brought\nwithin three months and\nothers within six.
