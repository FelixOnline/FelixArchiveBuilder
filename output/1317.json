We had with us a team\nof eight people, including a\nstrong four man team.\nThe Southampton team\nfinally arrived, and we were\nshown around their small but\npleasant range. We got shooting straight away, with the\ndetails carefully worked out\nso that two members of each\nteam were shooting at the\nsame time. Time went by with\nboth good and bad scores\nbeing registered. Eventually\nit was clear that we were loos-ing, but only by a small mar-gin, which we were pleased\nabout. The overall match\nscore was taken as the top\nfour from each team, giving a\nmaximum score of 400.\nWe were even more pleased\nwhen we realised that we\nhad time left to have a bit of\nfun. We decided to have a fun\nshoot... a very rapid fun shoot.\nWe shot ten rounds in 60 sec-onds. This is a pretty hard\ntask, which explains why the\ntop score was only 66 out of\n100, not 98 as it had been in\nthe previous shoot!\nWe then retired to a pub\nto enjoy a buffet of tasty\ncheap food and beer. The\nSouthampton team were\neven kind enough to get us\na couple of bottles of wine for\ncoming second! Most of the\nteam returned to London that\nevening, but a few stayed to\nexperience the student nightlife in Southampton.\nAll in all, it was a great\nafternoon of shooting, despite\nour narrow loss. Hopefully\nthis will become an annual\nevent and I am sure that we\nwill meet them again next\nyear \u2013 hopefully to win.\nBristol 3\nImperial 1\nBy Geoffrey Quint\nOn 22 January, the Imperial\nclay pigeon shooting teams\ntook part in their first ever\nfriendly against Bristol\nUniversity. Having set off\nfrom South Kensington, the\njourney was uneventful until\nwe reached Membury serv-ices, perhaps partly due to a\nlarge proportion of the team\nnursing hangovers. The services proved revitalising and\nwe continued the voyage after\na 20min heated \u2018discussion\u2019\nover which route to follow the\nrest of the way.\nWe arrived at Bristol\u2019s regular shooting ground just in\ntime to witness the start of\na lovely Westcountry shower\nthat would last the remainder of the day. The Bristol\nteam turned up half an hour\nlater and after a short confrontation with the manager,\nover the fact we brought our\nown cartridges, the fun com-menced.\nThe stands, located within a\nsmall wooded area, were varied and proved challenging\nfor all. At the end of the 50 bird\nsporting, each of the Bristol\nteams were ahead, apart from\nthe ladies\u2019 team. To finish the\nday, the men\u2019s teams shot a\nflush \u2013 80 clays launched from\nan elevated position in front\nof you and shot as a team\nof four guns. Whilst Imperial\nproved stronger in this discipline than Bristol, it would\nnot be enough to change the\nleader board and Bristol won\nthe day 3-1.\nDespite the result, the day\nwas thoroughly enjoyable and\na great practice for when we\nshoot against Bristol again\nat the BUSA Championships\nnext week.\nSHOOTING\nRifle and Pistol Club\non their travels\nTop and bottom: Konrad Skorko takes aim. Centre:\nImperial shooters in Southampton\nImperial Medicals\nMen\u2019s 3rd 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 4\nBy Adam Masters\nIn the quarter-final of the\nULU Football Men\u2019s Reserve\nPlate, Imperial Fifths took on\nICSM Thirds for the chance\nto achieve cup glory and\nprove their footballing pedigree in what has always been\na grudge match.\nDespite transportation\nproblems, the Fifths finally\nreached Teddington to\nencounter very windy conditions and an ICSM Third\nteam with only ten men. It\nwas clear from the off that it\nwas going to be a game of two\nhalves. Despite the numerical\nadvantage, the experienced\nFifths were not complacent\nand set their stall out early.\nControl of the midfield was\nvital and the IC players gave\n103% to achieve this.\nWithin ten minutes, an\nevent rarely seen in football\noccurred. The medics\u2019 goalkeeper hit a peach of a goal\nkick that was urged on by\nthe wind. The ball bounced\non the edge of the IC penalty\narea and continued towards\ngoal, flying in just under the\ncrossbar.\nAfter realising that this\nmust have been divine intervention to give the medics a\nhead start, the Fifths began\nto show why they have such a\ngood record in ULU Division\n2. Daniel Knott demonstrated\nhis class as a box to box\nplayer, being first to the ball\nall over the shop. Urged on\nby captain and winger Osman\nOzturk, the Fifths started to\ndemonstrate their calibre by\nstringing together a number\nof intricate passes. The sexy\nfootball continued until a\nperiod of pressure resulted in\nIC\u2019s French prodigy Clement\nAudoin clipping a cross in\nfrom the left. The ball landed\nat the grateful feet of top\nscorer Cemal Akcaba who\nstroked it into the bottom left\ncorner for the equaliser.\nAt half time, Oz used his\nusual tactic of threatening\neach player to motivate them.\nKnowing his violent past, the\nFifths needed no more reason to finish the game off.\nThe IC dominance continued\nin the second half with more\nfootball worthy of the \u2018beautiful game\u2019 being played.\nMore chances were created\nand before long there was a\nbreakthrough. Oz swung in a\ncorner from the right that was\nmajestically hammered home\nby centre back Mike Nikolich\nfrom close range, making\nit two-one to IC. More possession turned into another\ngoal soon afterwards. Once\nagain, Oz got the assist as he\nclipped a through ball past\nthe medics\u2019 defence to leave\nClement with a golden oppor-tunity, which he calmly took\nas he tucked the ball past the\n\u2018keeper.\nThe Fifths were all over the\nmedics like a rash despite the\narrival of their eleventh man.\nNew signing, Nicaraguan\ngoalkeeper Lester, did not\ntouch the ball in the second\nhalf, and that is not an exag-geration. The final nail in the\ncoffin came about 15 minutes from the end, as Adam\nMasters played a ball across\nthe medic penalty area to find\nDanny Wilson in space. Wilson\ncut inside and drilled the ball\ninto the bottom right corner\nwith the ferocity of a crazed\nwild animal. The last ten minutes were quite scrappy but\nnothing could detract from a\nwell earned four-one victory\nfor IC Fifths.\nA special mention must\ngo to the back four, including the Fifths\u2019 most consistent player, Sami \u2018the beast\u2019\nTaipalus, who is the subject\nof nightmares for any striker\nwho has played against him.\nThe organisation and technical ability of the defence has\nbeen a strong foundation for\nthis IC outfit to build on.\nOnce again, Imperial pride\nwas defended, but a rematch\nlooms as these two sides will\nface each other in the league\nvery soon. A good performance here saw the mighty\nFifths march on to the semi-finals.\nFOOTBALL\nMedics go under\nthe knife\nRed army?

But the main issue of\nthe evening was, inevitably,\nthe restructuring and the\nfuture of the campus as a\ncentre of learning at Imperial\nCollege.\nWhen security came to lock\nup the building at midnight,\nmany questions remained\nunanswered and students\npointed out that some of their\ncolleagues who had not been\nso interested in the hustings\nmight also like to hear about\nthe future of Wye. As a result,\nUnion President Mustafa Arif\nhas also arranged to visit Wye\non Monday, and he will be taking questions.\nThe Wye College Union\nSociety will be holding their\nown question and answer session this evening (Thursday).\nWhilst Wye students will\nhopefully welcome this late\ngesture towards communica-tion, many are disappointed\nthat the Deputy Rector does\nnot intend to take students\u2019\nquestions. Furthermore, the\nRector\u2019s face-to-face event at\nthe Wye campus, which last\nyear took place during the\nEaster holidays, has yet to\nbe announced for this 2004-5 in spite of the College\u2019s\nSpectrum intranet saying\nthat an event will take place\nat each campus over the academic year.\nThe proposed closure of\nmost courses at Wye was\nannounced in August. Some\nstudents first heard about the\nplans through the national\npress while they were at home\nover the summer, although\nthe College has said that this\nwas due to information being\n\u2018leaked\u2019 by staff unions.\nThe Department of\nAgricultural Sciences subsequently issued a statement\nguaranteeing that all current students would be able\nto complete their degrees at\nWye, but longer term information has so far been significantly less forthcoming.\nThe Department of\nEnvironmental Science and\nTechnology and the Division\nof Biomedical Sciences will\nalso be significantly affected\nby the restructuring process,\nbut with less drastic changes\nfor biology and biochemistry\nstudents.\nAn angry Wye student questions Imperial College Union officers about the future of his\ncampus at the recent election hustings. Wye students will be keen to discover more about\nthe College\u2019s plans for the campus when the Deputy Rector visits next week\nBy Dave Edwards\nMustafa Arif, President of\nImperial College Union, faces\na motion of no confidence at\nan emergency Council meeting tomorrow evening.\nThe motion, proposed by\nTom Tibbits, a postgraduate\nin the physics department\nand member of the Union\u2019s\nExecutive Committee, alleges\nthat the President is \u201cguilty of\ngross misconduct and breach\nof the constitution and regulations\u201d.\nA paper calling for greater\naccountability was passed\nby the Council in December\n(see Felix 1310), mandating\nthe President to give various\nexplanations and responses.\nBad management at elec-tions, an under-represented\nExecutive Committee and\nunauthorised increases in\ncosts were just some of the\nissues raised. Mr Tibbits\nargues: \u201cThe President\u2019s\nresponse was inadequate,\nand along the lines of \u2018there\u2019s\nnot enough time to do everything so you\u2019ll just have to\ntrust me as a leader\u2019.\u201d\nThe motion claims that Mr\nArif is \u201cdemonstrating an attitude that is inconsistent with\nthe Union\u2019s status as a stu-dent-led democratic organisation.\u201d It also makes other allegations against the President\nand his style of management\nwhich cannot be released for\nlegal reasons.\nMr Arif said: \u201cI\u2019m happy to\nreceive and respond to criticism done in the right way.\nI think the author [of this\nmotion] and his supporters\nshould think long and hard\nabout whether all this silliness is in the best interests of\nthe Union as a whole.\u201d\nMr Tibbits claims that\nthe President is running\nthe Union \u201cin a very elitist,\nundemocratic, uninclusive\nway.\u201d He told Felix: \u201cWe [the\nstudents] cannot tolerate\nleadership that doesn\u2019t take\nus into account.\u201d\nThe motion requires a two\nthirds majority of Council\nmembers. If it is passed, Mr\nArif would be suspended for\none month on full pay and\naccommodation, and then\ndismissed.\nMr Arif may appeal against\nthe Council\u2019s decision, but\nhe would need to call a general meeting attended by at\nleast 200 students within five\nCollege days. This meeting\nwould then have the final say.\nUnion President may\nface dismissal\nMustafa Arif at a recent\nUnion Council meeting\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nNext year\u2019s Imperial College\nUnion President, Deputy\nPresidents and Felix Editor\nwere elected last week.\nThe turnout reached a\nrecord high of more than 2800\nvotes \u2013 over 22% of the student body. Mustafa Arif, the\ncurrent President, expressed\nhis pleasure at the turnout,\nsaying: \u201cThe Union is now\nin a much stronger position\nto legitimately represent students than at any time in its\nhistory.\u201d\nSameena Misbahuddin, the\ncurrent Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) was\nelected as President, overcoming her nearest challenger Morten Olesen by 1126\nvotes to 862 after the other\ncandidates\u2019 votes had been\nreallocated.\nMs Misbahuddin told Felix:\n\u201cI was delighted to be voted\nPresident and I\u2019m looking forward to it immensely. There\u2019s\na lot of work ahead, as always,\nbut I\u2019ll do my very best to\njustify the faith of those who\nsupported me.\u201d\nTim Aplin will be the new\nDeputy President (Finance\nand Services), with 930 votes\nto 510 for Edward Piggott and\n289 for Re-Open Nominations,\nafter Robin Avery had been\ndisqualified.\nSimon Matthews was elect-edasDeputyPresident(Clubs\nand Societies) by 816 votes to\n672 for James Thatcher after\nvotes for a new election had\nbeen reallocated.\nThe new Deputy President\n(Education and Welfare) will\nbe Sarah Khatib, who overcame Aleks Corr by 911 votes\nto 802 in the final round.\nRupert Neate was elected\nas Felix Editor with 962 votes\nto 668 for Darius Nikbin after\nthe other candidates\u2019 votes\nhad been reallocated.\nMs Misbahuddin\u2019s campaign was largely based on\nher experience as a Deputy\nPresident, but the option of\ntaking a second sabbatical\nyear may not be available\nto future candidates, after a\npaperrestrictingtermsofsab-batical office to a maximum\nof one year was passed by\nthe Union Council last week.\nSince the paper proposes a\nconstitutional change, it must\nstill be passed by a second\nmeeting of the Union Council\nand by the College Council\nbefore it comes into force.\nElection results\nannounced\nSameena Misbahuddin,\nnext year\u2019s Union President\n\n"

You get a point for matching which picture goes to\nwhich desciption, and two for telling us who it is we\u2019re moaning about\nA. They spend their Wednesday\nafternoons chasing round/egg\nshaped balls around, then go to\nthe union to get pissed (in shirts\nand ties, the knobs) and sing about\ntheir sexual prowess.

If\nyou do certain courses it\u2019s probably\npossible to go days without seeing\none. Well, an attractive one at least.\nIt\u2019s enought to make you like UCL.\nF.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005 11\nClubs & Societies felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Chris Rowlands\nI\u2019ve been feeling a bit guilty of\nlate, for a few reasons. One of\nthose reasons, which involves\nan unnamed Sabbatical\nOfficer, a rubber chicken and\nthe entire cast of Cats, will\nremain mercifully untold,\nwhereas the more pressing\nreason is that most of these\narticles have used props that\nsome people may not have\nready access to. After a guilt-wracked few days and one\nmoment of inspiration, I\u2019ve\ndiscovered the perfect prop,\nowned by (nearly) everyone:\nthe toothbrush!\nWARNING: Whilst great\nfun, the following trick can be\ndangerous. By trying it, you\nare accepting responsibility\nfor your own actions, and\nnobody here is responsible if\nyou mess it up. If you want\nfurther advice on safety,\nplease contact juggling@ic.\nac.uk, preferably before\nsomething goes wrong.\nOf course, this being\nImperial College Juggling\nSociety, simple toothbrush\nmanipulation is not sufficient.\nTherefore, in order to make\nthe photos more entertaining,\nthis toothbrush will be on fire.\nThe key is to keep it moving,\nsince if the toothbrush spends\nany significant length of time\npointing upwards, the flames\neat away at the plastic handle\nand you\u2019re suddenly holding\na handful of hot molten plastic and chlorine fumes. This\ntends to make brushing your\nteeth with it afterwards much\nmore difficult.\nAs with any activity, safety\nis paramount. The important\nsafety tips are firstly to have\na fire extinguisher and fire\nblanket present at all times.\nHaving a friend present to\nhelp extinguish the flames is\nalso a good idea, since when\nyour trousers have ignited\nand your pubic hair is heavily\nsinged, the last thing on your\nmind is how to pull the pin out\nof the damn fire extinguisher properly. The next most\nimportant thing is not to wear\nartificial fibres, since they\u2019re\nmuch more flammable and\nmake you look like a chav\n[see picture 1].\nSpinning the toothbrush is\nrelatively easy \u2013 start in the\nposition shown, with the bristles pointing away from you.\nDo not apply toothpaste, as it\nwill get everywhere. Note the\nfoil between the wick and the\nplastic \u2013 this is an important\nfactor in preventing the handle from melting all over your\nfeet [see picture 2].\nDip the wick in paraffin,\nshake off the excess and get\na lighter ready. You may wish\nto try a few practice spins\nfirst, to get used to it. Once\nyou\u2019re ready, light the wick\nand start spinning [see picture 3]. Swing the toothbrush\nin a circle that starts with\nthe handle moving away from\nyou. To keep it spinning you\nmust move your finger in a\nsmall, gentle circle \u2013 if you try\nto do it too fast, it will just fall\noff, and whoever catches it\nwill not be best pleased.\nSadly, this is an experimental art form and we\u2019ve\nnot quite discovered an efficient way to stop. The current method is to either wait\nuntil the paraffin runs out,\nor wait until it burns your\nfinger and you drop it, as per\nour blurred, but entertaining\nphoto [picture 4].\nSo that\u2019s it.

The latter\nis partly down to another one\nof our hastily compiled fea-tures, the dreaded \u2018Scumbag\u2019,\nwhere we consign the week\u2019s\nworst offenders to our virtual cesspit of despair.

    "content": "Every once in a while I go to the\ntheatre and see a production and I\nstagger away drunken with excitement and say to myself, \u201cThis is\nwhy I love theatre, this is why I am\nhere.\u201d Tejas Verdes at The Gate\ntheatre is the most recent production to give me those feelings.\nRight off, I\u2019d like to apologise \u2013 I\nhave nothing bad to say about this\nshow. Tejas Verdes is 70 minutes of\nmonologues performed promenade-style. So ladies and gents keep your\nknees bent and relaxed (three people fainted during the performance\nI saw and it was rather distracting).\nTejas Verdes, meaning green\nroofing tiles, was the Auschwitz\nof General Pinochet\u2019s regime in\nChile. This torture and detention\ncamp was in use for almost a year\nand could hold up to 200 prisoners.\nThe audience is taken on a journey\nfollowing a young girl through her\ntorture. Colorina, played by Shereen\nMartineau, is a fictional character that playwright Ferm\u00edn Cabal\ncreated based on real testimonies\ngiven by torture survivors in Chile.\nThe all-female cast of five could\nnot fail to move you. Martineau\nplays Colorina intelligently and you\nalways want more of her. The other\ncharacters are people that have been\ntouched by Colorina in some way.\nDiana Hardcastle playing both\nThe Friend and The Informer\ngives you a heart-wrenching\nlook at how terrible it can be to\nbefriend someone and give them up.\nGemma Jones, who is known\nfrom such films as Bridget Jones:\nOn the Edge of Reason, delivers\nan amazing performance as The\nGravedigger. Her eyes are piercing and it\u2019s impossible to look away\nas she describes her personal sickening encounter with Colorina.\nWhile it seems impossible, Tejas\nVerdes gives the audience a new\nlook at torture, torturers and torture victims. The verbal descriptions of methods of torture are\nnauseating on a level that parallels with the film Schindler\u2019s List.\nDon\u2019t go for happy fuzzy warm\nfeelings, be prepared for gut-wrenching, heart-tugging disgust.\nEven if you don\u2019t go for the act-ing, or the new look at torture, the\nset and its designer Dick Bird do\ndefinitely deserve your applause.\nIf anything, this remarkable rendition of a forest is vivid and strik-ing. Tree trunks dripping with\nsap surround the audience, while\nstanding on several centimetres\nof soft dirt and cobblestones. As I\nwalked into the dark theatre, I could\nsmell the outdoors and I clutched\nmy overcoat, as I felt transported\nout of London into a chilled forest.\nThe play closed on 19 February,\nbut a new run has been announced\nfor March. If you didn\u2019t go the first\ntime round, you missed an experi-ence, one that would have stayed\nwith you forever, don\u2019t miss your\nsecond opportunity.\nTejas Verdes\n7 - 26 March\nThe Gate Theatre,\nPembridge Road, W11\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005 17\nGut-wrenching\nTatum Fjerstad goes beyond the West End\nFree time: how to spend it, if\nyou still remember what it is\nOK, so I\u2019m feeling a little jaded and\nworn out: term grinds on as it always\ndoes, and the work load isn\u2019t getting\nany lighter, in fact the thought that\nthere aren\u2019t even four whole weeks\nof term left is becoming a truly\nfrightening prospect! However, what\nis really getting to me is the fact\nthat I\u2019m missing out on so many\ngreat opportunities to see exhibitions and performances. Due to end\nof term \u2018scheduling issues\u2019, I\u2019m having to give up my ticket for second\npart of Wagner\u2019s Ring at the Royal\nOpera \u2013 with my luck, I\u2019ll never hear\nTerfel\u2019s Wotan! That was my rant,\nI\u2019ll move on now.\nThere are a number of exhibitions on in town these days that\nreally ought to be seen. At the Royal\nAcademy, Turks is currently run-ning, (I have managed to see this\nand a review will soon follow), and\nwhat looks to be a fabulous Matisse\nexhibition will soon open. Turks is\na massive exhibition charting the\ncultural and artistic influences that\nfound their way into what became\nthe Ottoman Empire over a thousand years. Much of it is spectacu-lar. The Matisse exhibition, opening\non 5 March, will be a somewhat\nless physically taxing affair as it will\nbe housed in the smaller space at\nthe Academy, the Sackler Wing. The\nexhibition will include many of the\nartist\u2019s vividly colourful paintings\nand, exceptionally, also a number of\ntextile works.\nThe Tate Britain currently has the\nhighly acclaimed Turner, Whistler\nand Monet exhibition on. This charts\nthe influence of Turner\u2019s work on\nthat of the two rivals. This runs until\n15 March.\nIn terms of performance arts,\ndon\u2019t forget to look out for the really\ngood student offers from the London\nPhilharmonic. The run of Beethoven\nsymphonies is over, as are a series\nof concerts putting Sibelius centre-stage, but there is still a lot more\nout there. Check their website www.\nlpo.org.uk for programme details as\nwell as the offers. Paola Smith\nArts Editor\nGarbo and Monroe, Dietrich and\nDiMaggio, now it\u2019s your turn.

Push the Button\nis the brand new album from the\nChemical Brothers, who were initiated into the mainstream by 1999\u2019s\nSurrender with tracks such as Hey\nBoy, Hey Girl and Let Forever Be\ndebuting high in the charts.\nThe album follows the Brothers\u2019\nhistory of collaborations, including\nRichard Ashcroft, Noel Gallagher\nand Bobby Gillespie, by kicking off\nto a flying start with a helping hand\nfrom the talented Q-Tip (A Tribe\nCalled Quest) on Galvanize. This\nextrovert rampage is the first single from the album and has topped\ndownload charts since its release.\nThe track immediately shows the\ngenre-bending nature of Push The\nButton, making some purists feel\nthe Chemical Brothers have flown\noff course.\nCome Inside is a demonstration\nof the initiative used throughout\nthe record. Touching on old school\nwith chilling vocals, huge electro\nbursts and thundering bass hooks,\nthe track evolves into a hyperactive\nmix of build-ups and breakdowns.\nIt finishes by blending into The Big\nJump, a rollercoaster of electronica\nfrenzy and a sampling master class.\nThe industrial sounding Believe\nmoves the album in a fresh direc-tion, featuring up-and-coming Bloc\nParty\u2019s Kele Okereke on vocals,\nexploding out from a beat heavy\nshell with a potency only rivaled by\nThe Prodigy.\nOne of the hidden gems on Push\nThe Button is the phenomenal Hold\nTight London, brought to life by\nAnna-Lynn Williams\u2019 (Trespassers)\nvocals and has more than a passing resemblance to the sounds of\nSneakerPimpsandAir. Reminiscent\nof Underworld but with vision never\nheard before, Incubus-style whale\nnoises top off a surreal, 5am experi-ence. By the time you reach Surface\nTo Air, yet another job well done, the\nalbum is over. A guitar-ballad versus\ndance track finale, it has awe-inspir-ing finishing touch sound effects\nthat leave a warm glow inside.\nIt might sound corny saying there\nis something for everyone on the LP\n,\nbut I will anyway, from the military-themed hip-hop joint that is Left\nRight, featuring milky bass breaks\nand the vocally dexterous, Jay-Zsounding Mos Def, to the Casio\nkeyboard dedication from the eight-ies, Close Your Eyes. That\u2019s not all\n\u2013 the Brothers have also tried to\nlatch onto the R\u2019n\u2019B/crunk fad with\nShake Break Bounce, incorporating\nretro Space Invaders samples into a\nrapid bare beat and Spanish guitar.\nUnfortunately this becomes a brief\nlet down in the middle of a great\nalbum, trying too hard and ending up as a poor trip-hop wannabe.\nProbably the most unexpected element on the album is the slide blues\nguitar that plays throughout the\npenultimate track Marvo Ging with\nsurprisingly great results.\nThereareplentyoffivestaralbums\nabout but the careful construction of\nPush The Button is on another level;\nseminal it most definitely is. A joy\nto listen to, it is a display of amazing album composition, an all but\nforgotten art that barely features on\nany modern releases. Rowlands and\nSimons suck you into their world\nfrom the first bars of the opening\ntrack and don\u2019t let go for the whole\n60-minute journey; something I had\nto repeat straight away. The sound\nof Push The Button will haunt clubs\nfor years to come. It is an instant\nclassic and benchmark for albums\nin the vague vicinity of the dance\ngenre.\nThe welcome return of The\nChemical Brothers, once more\nchanges the way we look at music.\nNot only will the plethora of rock,\nindie, rap and hip-hop vocalists\non the album add to the universal\nappeal but they help The Chemical\nBrothers raise the bar in what\nseemed a drained genre. Admittedly,\nwith exception to Galvanize, the\nalbum lacks the vocal catch phrases symbolic of previous works and\nthere is an overwhelming sense\nof refinement, which might not be\nto everyone\u2019s taste. The Chemical\nBrothers have also run the risk of\noverwhelming the listener by incorporating a vast range of influences\nto the album, but looking back it felt\nlike a natural progression. The live\nshow experience has certainly made\nthe Chemical Brothers more aware\nof the pressures of follow-up albums,\nbut I love this production. Clean but\nnot clinical, it provides a healthy\nshot of dance that we all need.\nDrawing from their contemporaries such as Faithless and Leftfield,\nRowlands and Simons have built\non experience, creating something\na bit special: a summary of why\nBritish dance is undoubtedly the\nbest in the world. A defining example of their previous work Push The\nButton is not, but it does everything\nelse you\u2019d expect from veterans of\nthe festival circuit.\nSo if you don\u2019t have tickets to their\nupcoming show, go and find a tout\nbecause it will the best laser-fest\nyou\u2019ll ever go to. But if being pummelled into submission by one of the\nmost sublime live shows around isn\u2019t\nyour cup of tea, there is no excuse\nnot to own the album, whatever\nyou\u2019re into. Matthew Hartfield\nThe Chemical Brothers: they\u2019ll punch you, they\u2019re not kidding\nThe Marble Index are huge in Canada, but over here they merit little more than a gig at the\nBetsey Trotswood, capacity 60. Felix questioned them closely on fame and booze\nLIVE REVIEW\nThis is a very strange occurrence.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic,\nCanada\u2019s The Marble Index would\nbe playing venues equivalent to\nthe Astoria here, or even Brixton\nAcademy when supporting bands\nlike The Pixies. Here they\u2019re playing The Betsey Trotswood, a little underground cavern where I\npatiently sit through David Gray\nwannabes The Motorpool, with\nabout five other people. Five! There\nare people in Canada who would kill\nfor this opportunity.\nInstead of going through the\nmotions in what they confess to\nbeing the smallest venue they\u2019ve\never played, The Marble Index treat\nit as a chance to let off some steam,\nand rip through a devilishly noisy\nset.\nSo what do they sound like? The\n\u2018garage\u2019 term gets lazily thrown\naround a lot, that sound of 2002. Is\nthat fair? Sure, they have the energy and presence of The Datsuns,\nbut not the fret-wankery or massive\nboredom factor. They also have the\nmelodicism of The Vines, but with\nout a spastic spoilt-kid singer. In\nfact, a good genre I\u2019d stick on them\nwould be (whisper it quietly) new-wave.\nA new-wave garage band, you\nscoff! Whatever next, punk-funk?\nIt\u2019s not instantly obvious as they\nlaunch into A Lot Of These Things,\nwith Brad\u2019s lazy Canadian drawl,\nbut then you notice that Ryan is\nattacking his bass in a way I could\nonly describe as angular.\nAs they yelp their way through\nsingle I Believe and the melodically\nbrilliant Not So Bright, you can see\nhow The Marble Index have built up\nsuch popularity. These are rocking\ntracks that would not sound out of\nplace on the radio, albeit XFM or\nthe likes.\nI\u2019m desperately trying to decipher\nwhat I have written about the rest of\nthe set, but a mixture of excitement\nand LOUD seems to have turned\nmy careful journalistic musings into\nsomething deposited by an inebriated spider. I think I\u2019ve written \u201cHoly\nno! Disco bassline! What are his\nhands doing?\u201d in conjunction with\nWe Can Make It and, rather confus-ingly, \u201cNice! Chords above the 12th\nfret + rawk. Bleeeed!\u201d for the furious finisher Creamin\u2019.\nMost certainly more than a one\ntrick pony, seriously sharp rock plus\nwhat I can only describe as inhuman\nbass lines equals a band on the up.\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before they\nwin England over too.\nJames Millen\nThe Marble Index\nThe Betsey Trotswood\nHHHII\nINTERVIEW\nThe band have been called \u201celectric\ngarage pop\u201d, but they\u2019re not too\nkeen on that description. Brad (gui-tar/vocals) told me: \u201cI don\u2019t like the\nwhole garage connotation, because\nit implies everything that came out\naround the time of The Strokes. We\nkinda have a rough sound, it isn\u2019t\nmeant to be really shiny or clean,\nbut I wouldn\u2019t go as far as garage.\u201d\nAdam (drums) sees it differently:\n\u201cWith pop together it almost fits. I\ndon\u2019t think you could call it pop on\nit\u2019s own, or garage on its own. If\nyou\u2019ve got to label it I guess garage-pop is OK.\u201d\nThose cursed words \u201cThe Next\nBig Thing\u201d have been bandied\naround when describing the band.\nRyan (bass) said: \u201cWe started hearing it at the beginning of 2003, there\nwas some hype in Canada.\u201d They\nlaugh. \u201cIt\u2019s better than saying \u2018the\nnext piece of shit\u2019!\u201d\nThey\u2019ve described themselves\nas \u201cthe real deal\u201d, although they\ndon\u2019t seem to remember who said it.\nAdam elaborates: \u201cI think when we\nsaid \u2018the real deal\u2019 we were referring to the fact that we\u2019re not faking\nit, what we do is genuine to us, it\u2019s\nwhat we really want to do, we\u2019re\nnot doing it to fit into a scene. It\u2019s\nhonest.\n\u201cWe came together on our own, we\nweren\u2019t put together by any higher\nforces,\u201d adds Ryan, before a discussion about Busted ensues.\nJust to give you have an understanding of how huge they are, this\nband have toured with the Pixies.\nOut of all their support slots, they\u2019ve\nfound that the highlight.\nBrad: \u201cI think musically our\nfavourite had to be the Pixies. The\nDears are mates of ours, so it\u2019s\nalways good to see them, and Hot\nHot Heat was good, but that was a\nwhile ago.\u201d They\u2019ve been playing\nhuge venues recently, Brad says:\n\u201cMost of them were between five\nand nine thousand capacity.\u201d Adam:\n\u201cWe felt comfortable there.\u201d\nBrad has been heard to say \u201cevery\ntime the booze is free flowing, we\nalways get into some trouble!\u201d\nThey laugh nervously. Brad elab-orates: \u201cWe\u2019re paying for it [the\nbooze] tonight! That\u2019s the way it is,\nwhen the booze just keeps coming\nyou people just say things... I\u2019ve put\nmy foot in my mouth a few times,\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve made some enemies\nwhen I was sauced up. I\u2019m sure we\nall have, but when it goes free, we\nall seem to take advantage of the\nfreedom of alcohol!\u201d\nThey even have their own label,\n\u2018Death Of Records\u2019. Brad explains\nthat its mostly for putting out their\nown stuff: \u201cSomewhere down the\nroad, if things go well, we wouldn\u2019t\nrule out trying to sign other bands,\nbut right now, it\u2019s just for our own\nthing.\u201d\nIncredibly, they recorded the\nalbum in Wigan. That\u2019s Wigan,\nEngland. \u201cThere\u2019s a great producer\nthere, John Kettle [Moco, Roller,\nTuuli]\u201d, Ryan explains.\nAdam: \u201cWe went there to test\nsome stuff out, and we really liked\nworking with him [Kettle] and the\nstudio. I\u2019m sure we could have gone\nother places if we wanted to but we\nfelt really comfortable there. That\nwas the main reason for going to\nWigan.\u201d\nAsked to comment on this, ahem,\nconstructive criticism, \u201cThis is\nan album for those who get their\nrocks off on indecipherable lyrics\nand annoying guitar. For everyone\nelse it\u2019s just an expensive coaster\nof suck\u201d, they laugh, before finally\nresponding.\nAdam: \u201cYou know who wrote that?\nIt was that huge Nickleback guy [a\nfan, I presume, not just a big guy\nfrom Nickleback).\u201d\nBrad: \u201cIn context, if you take it\nfrom someone whose favourite band\nis Nickleback, then I don\u2019t really\nmind. I wouldn\u2019t expect someone\nto be a fan of Nickleback and us. It\ndoesn\u2019t really throw me off.\u201d\nJames Millen\nThe Marble Index\n\u201cExpensive coaster of suck\u201d\nThe Chemical Brothers\nPush The Button\n(Virgin)\nHHHHH\n\n"

For the first time\never, we actually have not\njust enough players to field a\nteam, but also reserves!\nVictories have come over\nmany prestigious teams who\nhave previously thrashed us:\nUCL Thirds, Sussex Seconds\nand GKT Thirds, to name but\na few! We are also through to\nthe semi-finals of this years\nULU Cup, having previously always gone out in the\nfirst round, by winning our\nquarter-final nine-nil (six of\nwhich were scored by Eline,\nwho was sorely missed in\nthe Goldsmiths match \u2013 how\nmany blokes are worth missing hockey for, hey?)\nAnyway, enough showing off, down to the match\nin question. We turned up at\nHarlington slightly apprehen-sive, as we knew Goldsmiths\nwere top of our BUSA league\nand had drawn with the one\nteam that had beaten us.\nHowever, we had faith in our\nsolid defending and speedy\nattacking to win through once\nagain.\nUnfortunately our faith\nwas shaken when, seconds\nafter the whistle had blown,\nGoldsmiths tucked away a\nswift and solid goal. Luckily it\nwas enough to shake us into\naction and that was the last\nthat goalie Suzie saw of the\nball, thanks to our unyielding defenders Suzie M, Fiona,\nAmanda, Chloe and Maria not\nletting a single ball past!\nThe equalising goal came\nsoon after though, with Suzie\nO knocking the ball past their\ngoalie and into the corner of\nthe net. This was swiftly followed by Lauren\u2019s \u2018goalpost\u2019\nsweep to take us into the lead,\nthen Clare\u2019s stunning strike\nfrom the penalty spot area.\nGoldsmiths then got scared,\nand pulled all of their players back into the D, making\nit tricky for our attackers to\nget in. Anna kept up her valiant efforts, running straight\nthrough the Goldsmith\u2019s\ndefence to try to advance on\ngoal, supported by Suzie O in\nleft midfield always running\nclear of her marker into free\nspace for the passes.\nHalf time came too quickly,\nwith us still only being two\ngoals in the lead \u2013 not a large\nenough margin for our liking!\nThanks to our inspirational\ntalk from captain Claire\n(unfortunately not playing\ndue to injury \u2013 get better soon\nClaire, we miss you on the\npitch) we started the second\nhalf with renewed energy.\nMore goal pie was to swiftly\nto follow. Jen started with\nanother goalpost sweep,\npushed straight through the\ngoalie. Marianne, having\ncrossed the ball for that goal,\nwas then determined to grab\nher share of the limelight,\nexecuting a hit from the edge\nof the D which hit the mark!\nClare A then went on to take\nus up to an even six by scoring her second of the day.\nThe forwards were excellent at standing on the goalposts even though Nush\nwasn\u2019t there to remind us all\nevery 30 seconds!\nHuge thanks from all the\nteam go to Martin, Jon and\nSam for braving the cold and\nresisting the temptation of\nHarlington\u2019s bar to umpire\nfor us. You did a great job\nguys!\nSo the Seconds\u2019 current\nunbeaten string continues.\nWe left the pitch on a high,\nready for the joys of a bowling\nsocial with the boys\u2019 Seconds,\na fabulous end to the day!\nSpecial mention must go to\nJen, who suddenly learnt how\nto actually hold a bowling ball\nproperly and proceeded to\nbeat some blokes (who won\u2019t\nbe named and shamed here!),\nClaire\u2019s fabulous strike, and\nMaria for getting quite drunk\nquite fast and throwing a ball\nbackwards! Roll on Sunday\u2019s\nmatch!\nSt Bart\u2019s Women\u2019s 2nd 0\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd10\nSunday was a cold cold day,\nbut still 11 valiant ladies\n(plus Captain Claire to organise us all) met up at South\nKensington tube station\nready to make the long trek\ninto East London in the most\nroundabout way possible,\nthanks to the District Line\nbeing out of action again!\nIn true Imperial style we\narrive late, only to be told\nthere were no changing\nrooms. Rather than strip off\nat the side of the pitch, we\nopted to change in the toilets of their local pub, and\ndespite being locked in by\nthe landlord (it wasn\u2019t opening time yet, we got let in\nspecially) we still managed\nto find our way to the pitch,\nwhere the umpires were trying to persuade some local\nkids that they really didn\u2019t\nwant to be playing football on\nthe St Bart\u2019s Astroturf.\nEventually the game got\nunderway, but due to the bitter cold and howling wind,\nwe got off to a slow start with\nthe ball coming straight to\nour end and the opposition\ngranted a short corner. But\nthanks to goalie Suzie\u2019s fabulous save, followed by Suzie\nM\u2019s spectacular clearance,\nthe ball went hurtling back to\nwhere we wanted it.\nDespite valiant efforts by\nJen to keep knocking the ball\ninto the goal, we failed to find\nback of the net until 20 minutes had passed, when Eline\nscored. This was the inspiration we needed and was\nswiftly followed by a second\nfrom Lauren, then another\nfrom Eline herself.\nOur half time talk from\nCaptain Claire was swift, but\nto the point, in summary:\n\u201cYou lot are way better than\nthe opposition, score more\ngoals!\u201d\nTaking her advice to heart,\nwe did! Eline completed her\nhat trick in style, taking a\nforward pass from Amanda\nto the centre of the D and\nknocking it past their keeper,\nClare A pushed two in from\nsharp angles, and Radha\npicked up a strong hit out\nfrom the opposition, pushing\nit back to Lauren who finished it into the net.\nAnna, not content with\nscoring her first goal of the\nseason, had to go better than\nthat and scored a hat-trick\nto match Eline\u2019s, with one\nspectacular goal from a top\nD strike. Fiona also scored\nher first of the season \u2013 not\nbad for a defender! Ten goals\nin total (count them up if\nyou don\u2019t believe us!). \u2018Most\ninjured of the match\u2019 went to\nSuzie O, who came off worst\nin a battle with the ball and\nher lip, but being dedicated\nto her game (and thankful for\nher gumshield) she carried\non playing regardless!\nOver yummy food provided\nby St Bart\u2019s (in the same\npub where we got changed),\nFiona was named man of the\nmatch and we all went home\nhappy.\nHOCKEY\nTwo matches, 16 goals!\nThe Imperial women\u2019s second hockey team\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005\nSPORT sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\n23\nLondon Winter League 4\nBy Alex Dunnett and\nSu Chian Phang\nLondon Winter League\n(LWL) brings together an\neclectic mix of Ultimate\nteams from the south east on\neven the most cold, wet and\nwindy of Sunday mornings.\nLWL never fails to provide\ngreat spirited contests and,\ndespite the howling gales,\nlast Sunday was no exception\nas Disc Doctors (DD) pitched\nup on Wandsworth common\nto prove their worth.\nDD1 13\nLtd Release \u2018Ladies\u2019 0\nOpening the day\u2019s play with a\nhuge upwind pull (the equivalent of kick-off), the Disc\nDoctors first team asserted\npressure from the start. Their\nzonal defence proved impenetrable and, combined with\nsome patient play into the\nwind, DD soon cleaned up\nthe mismatched contest.\nDD1 3\nCurve 2\nAfter 20 minutes of action,\nthis game was heading for a\nrare frisbee scoreline of nil-nil. Eventually, though, Disc\nDoctors won the first point\nwhilst trying to throw into\na force 5 gale! Coming back\ndownwind was a piece of cake\nas DD soon doubled their\nadvantage. A cracking defensive block from Naiff merely\nenforced the Doctors\u2019 authority further, combined with the\never growing consistency of\nKris Wong with the disc in\nhand.\nDD1 3\nChain Pier Pressure 1\nOur third consecutive match\nwas a spirited affair against\na motley crew of Brighton\u2019s\nfinest. Another gale had mustered by this point, culminating in \u201cthe comedy moment of\nthe day\u201d as Stylish launched a\nsimple five yard scoring pass\nwhich caught the wind and\nended 30 yards downfield!\nDespite this minor setback,\nDD1 took control and never\nlet their dominance with the\ndisc slip.\nDD1 2\nSixth Form Falmer 6\nYes, we did get beaten by a\nbunch of sixth formers, however it was our fourth consecutive hour of ultimate and\nthey were helped along by\nfive of London\u2019s finest play-ers. We failed to score into the\nwind, but still played our best\ndisc of the day in the opening passes of the game with\nManny in exceptional defensive fettle.\nThe wind was never going\nto allow ultimate quality to\nshine through, but a three-one record for the day showed\nDD\u2019s strength. Only five\nweeks remain until the South\nEast University Regionals\n\u2013 watch this space!\nDD2 6\nLSE (Equilibrium) 5\nDD2\u2019s first match of the day\nended with the right result:\nImperial\u2019s second team beating LSE\u2019s first team! The\nweather conditions meant\nthat both teams played a lot\nof zone defence, however\nthe experience gained from\nrecent DD practices helped\nDD2 to win the downwind\npoints quickly and put on the\npressure on LSE\u2019s offence.\nEveryone put in a stellar performance and LSE were left a\nbit sore by the loss.\n6ffu 12\nDD2 1\nThe second match against\n6ffu, a team of sixth form-ers, was obviously DD2\u2019s\nhardest game of the day.\nTheir opponents had several\nnational level handlers and\nmore than eager high school\nrunners to give DD2 a runa-round. However, both teams\nagreed that the point of the\nmatch was a quick, smooth\nand downright sexy play from\nDD2! A long huck was thrown\nover the stack by Finny and\nwas perfect for a sneaky cut\nfrom G. He was well supported by hard running from\nLisa and Stas as they made\nup ground, giving him options\nin the end zone. An easy throw\nand a calm catch completed\nthe well deserved move.\nDD2 5\nKCL (Thrown) 4\nIf the match against\nEquilibrium was big, DD2\u2019s\nmatch against Thrown was\nbigger! King\u2019s ultimate team\npractise with DD on a weekly\nbasis and are good friends,\nwhich made the match even\nmore important. With Thrown\nattacking into the harsh wind,\nDD2\u2019s zone worked effectively and efficiently, allowing the Doctors to intercept\nand score the first point. It\nwas a great match and the\ngame spirit was marvellous\nas jokes and encouragement\nwere passed between the\nteams.\nCurve 3\nDD2 2\nThis was DD2\u2019s third hour-long match in a row and legs\nwere beginning to tire. As\nusual, the typical obscure\nBritish weather kicked in and\nat during one point it even\nstarted snowing! But a little\nbit of snow didn\u2019t stop DD2\nfrom trying to score upwind.\nA contested foul on the other\nhand did and that meant that\none of DD2\u2019s scores had to be\nreplayed. The tight scoreline\nwas an accurate portrayal\nof the numerous chances\nboth teams had. If the match\nhad been played earlier or if\nDD2 had been allowed a\nbreak, the scoreline might\nhave favoured Imperial\u2019s second team. Well, we like to\nthink so anyway!\nAll in all, it was an excellent\nday for DD2, as we showed\nreal grit and determination. It\nwas the icing on the cake that\nwe finished in the top half\nof our group. It will be a sad\ntime at the end of the year\nwhen many members of the\nclub will be leaving, (hope-fully) moving on to better\nthings. But never fear, there\nare definitely more than a\nfew quality players waiting to\ntake over!\nULTIMATE FRISBEE\nFrisbees in the wind\n\n"

The issue at hand?\nVisa extension charges for international students.\nHistorically,internationalstudents\nhave been exempt from charges to\nrenew their visas. Last year, without\nany consultation, the Government\nintroduced a \u00a3250 charge (\u00a3150 if\nyou have time to wait for a postal\napplication). This caused endless\ngrief. Now the Government are proposing to raise the charges even\nfurther to \u00a3350.\nWhy are they doing this? Well,\nofficially, it\u2019s because the Treasury\nwants all immigration services to\ncover its costs (so the UK taxpayer\ndoesn\u2019t pay for the administrative\noverheads that apply to each visa\napplication/renewal). This argument doesn\u2019t quite wash, because\nif you apply to the Foreign Office\n(whilst you are abroad) you only\npay \u00a336 for a visa. The much higher\ncharge only applies when you are\nalready in the UK and wish to renew\nyour visa. (Yes, you are better off\nsimply going to Paris for the weekend and applying via the British\nembassy there.)\nThe real reason for these charges is because the government has\nidentified international students as\na cash cow to fund its immigration and asylum policy. The policy\nitself (to crack down on the \u201cflood\u201d\nof \u201cuncontrolled\u201d immigration and\n\u201cbogus\u201d asylum seekers), itself panders to Tory politicking designed\nto pander to irrational xenophobic\nfears. How on earth this is all supposed to realise Tony Blair\u2019s stated\ndesire to make the UK welcoming\nto diverse international students is\nbeyond me.\nAnd finally\nYes, I know we are British \u2018subjects\u2019, not \u2018citizens\u2019. However, I\nam a republican. A hereditary\nhead of state is a relic of the middle ages and should be abolished\nwell before anyone needs to worry\nabout whether Camilla can become\nQueen.\nThe Home Office\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nUNCLE SAM\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nThe laughing policeman\nMost people will never have any\ncontact with the police in their lives,\nunless perhaps a crime has been\ncommitted against them or their cat\nhas gone missing.\nSometimes, however, people can\nbe unfortunate and find themselves\nin the wrong place at the wrong time\n\u2013 perhaps a crime has been committed close by. In this sort of situation,\nthe police may spot you and decide\nto search you.\nWhen you find yourself in this posi-tion, it is always good to know your\nrights and know what the police can\nand can\u2019t do.\nWhat is a \u2018stop and search\u2019?\nPolice officers can stop and talk to\nyou at any time. But they should\nonly search you if they suspect you\nare carrying:\n\u25cf drugs\n\u25cf weapons\n\u25cf stolen property\n\u25cf items that could be used to commit a crime.\nWhy me?\nYou should not be stopped or\nsearched just because of your age,\nrace, ethnic background, nationality,\nreligion or faith, the way you look,\nthe language you speak or because\nyou have committed a crime in the\npast. If you believe this is the case,\nyou can complain.\nWhere can I be stopped and\nsearched?\nYou can be stopped and searched in\na number of areas including:\n\u25cf a public place\n\u25cf anywhere, if the police believe you\nhave committed a serious crime.\nIf the police have reason to believe\nthere may be serious violence, then\nthey can search everyone in an area\nfor weapons, without needing a\ngood reason to search each person.\nThis might happen near a football\nground, for example.\nA police officer can stop a vehicle\nat any time and ask to see the driver\u2019s licence. If the police have good\nreason to think your car contains\nstolen goods, drugs, or weapons,\nthey could search it even if you\nare not there. But the police must\nleave a notice saying what they have\ndone.\nWhat happens before a\nsearch takes place?\nThe police officer must normally\ntell you:\n\u25cf that you must wait to be searched\n\u25cf what law they are using and your\nrights\n\u25cf their name\n\u25cf the station they work at\n\u25cf why they chose you\n\u25cf what they are looking for\n\u25cf your right to be given a record of\nthe search straight away.\nIf the officer is not in uniform, they\nmust show you their identity card.\nIf you are in a public place, you\nonly have to take off your coat or\njacket and your gloves.\nIf the police ask you to take off\nmore than this, then in most cases\nthey will take you to the local police\nstation.\nYour right to a record\nIf you are searched, the police must\ngive you a written record of the\nsearch straight away unless, for\nexample, they are called away to an\nemergency. Alternatively, you can\nget a copy from the police station\nat any time within 12 months of the\nsearch.\nThe police must write down:\n\u25cf your name, or a description of\nyou\n\u25cf your ethnic background\n\u25cf why they searched you\n\u25cf when and where they searched\nyou\n\u25cf what they were looking for and\nanything they found\n\u25cf whether they are taking any\naction\n\u25cf the names and numbers of the\nofficers who searched you.\nThe police will ask for your name,\naddress and date of birth. You will\nalso be asked to say what your ethnic background is. You do not have\nto say what it is if you don\u2019t want to,\nbut this information helps show if\nthe police are stopping and searching people just because of their race\nor ethnicity.\nHow can I complain?\nThe police should treat you fairly and with respect. If you are\nunhappy with the way you were\ntreated, you can complain. If you feel\nyou were treated differently because\nof your race, nationality or ethnic\nbackground, you can complain of\ndirect or indirect race discrimina-tion.\nIt will help if you keep the record\nthat the police gave you.\nYou can get advice from, or complain to:\n\u25cf your local police station\n\u25cf your local police authority\n\u25cf a Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau\n\u25cf the Information and Advice\nCentre\n\u25cf your local Race Equality Council\n\u25cf the Commission for Racial\nEquality\n\u25cf a solicitor.\nIf you have any questions about this\narticle or feel the police have treated you unfairly, please contact The\nInformation and Advice Centre.\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into\na crisis.

    "content": "SPORT: VARSITY DAY 2005 sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005\n26\nSponsored by\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 7\nImperial Medicals\nMen\u2019s 1st 1\nBy Michael Berks\nFirst, let\u2019s set the scene.\nSometime last June, a room\nis filled with the leading luminaries of Imperial sports.\nTaking place are the initial\ndiscussions of bringing football into the festival of sport\nthat is the annual Varsity contest between Imperial and\nour medic counterparts. At\nsome point, the ICSM representative turned to the committee and said: \u201cThe football\nwill be excellent, it\u2019s always a\nclose game between us and\ntheir firsts.\u201d\nEin minuten bitte! Last\nseason we played our medic\nfriends three times, winning\ncomfortably on each occa-sion, with an aggregate score\nof 14\u20132, the last match being a\n7\u20131 mauling \u2013 close?! But hey,\nwe didn\u2019t mind, if the medics\nthought they\u2019d win, then all\nthe more fun it would be.\nHowever, whilst an easy victory was expected in the days\nleading up to the game, tensions were high and rumours\nwere rife of medic ringers.\nDid someone spot Ashley\nCole in a St Mary\u2019s hospital waiting room? As it was,\nthe only \u2018ringers\u2019 were Steve\nMorgan and Elliot, both bona\nfide medics, and, inciden-tally, both present during last\nyear\u2019s 7\u20131 thrashing.\nAnd so to the game itself:\nat this point, if the reader\nis a medic, they are advised\nto give up now, as it all goes\ndownhill from here...\nAfter a hectic opening ten\nminutes, giant Finnish centre\nback Kimo fired a 60 yard ball\ninto the path of the flying Sri\nLankan Mathan, who squared\nfor tapir-look-alike Oli to tap\nin from six yards.\nMinutes later, Tweedman\nwhipped in a corner from the\nright, but Pat Farr had clearly\ndecided that scoring was just\ntoo easy. Instead, he directed\na powerful downward header\nto the now stationary Oli, who\nraised a hoof to deflect the\nball into the goal.\nWith the pre-match nerves\nnow well and truly dispersed,\nImperial\u2019s football started\nto flow. Timur combined\nwith Berks, before intelligently switching the play\nto Imperial\u2019s right, and into\nMathan\u2019s territory. This time,\nthe mercurial winger pulled\nout an outrageous nutmeg\nto get to the by-line, before\nfiring a cross-cum-shot that\nthe hapless \u2018keeper could\nonly spill into the net. Threenil, and the boys in blue had\nbarely broken into a sweat!\nMore was to come, and goal\nfour was the best yet. This\ntime, Chris \u2018my left foot could\nperform surgery\u2019 Woodcock\npinged a superb through ball\nto guess who... yes, who else\nbut Mathan. Running onto the\nball, he barely broke stride in\nlofting a precocious first time\nlob from 25 yards over the\nadvancing medic \u2018keeper.\nFinally, just in case Imperial\nthought the first half couldn\u2019t\nget any better, Javier \u2018the\nbull\u2019 smashed home a 30 yard\nfree-kick to leave the score at\na resounding five-nil at the\nbreak.\nWith the game already over\nas a contest, it was natural\nthat the second half would be\na something of an anticlimax.\nHowever, there were still two\nimportant matters to resolve.\nFirstly, Mathan\u2019s hatrick,\nand secondly Berksy\u2019s as yet\nunopened account for the\nseason.\nSome tenacious play from\nJR \u2013 actually it might have\nbeen Woodcock but I\u2019ve\nalready mentioned him twice\nand JR deserves a mention\nfor being awesome throughout and looking like a rock\nstar \u2013 forced the ball through\nto Timur. He rounded the\n\u2018keeper but could only strike\nthe post from an acute angle.\nTheballreboundedtoMathan,\nwho thought, \u201cinstead of completing my \u2018trick, why not bag\nanother assist\u201d, and laid off\nto Berks, who drove the ball\nhome in jubilation.\nSuch unselfishness could\nnot go unrewarded, and the\nImperial crowd did not have\nto wait long for the final coup\nde grace. After some intricate\npossession football, stand-in\nright back Les Dennis played\nthe ball into Mathan\u2019s feet.\nWith his back to goal and three\ndefenders in attendance, the\ndanger to the medics looked\nminimal, but having turned\nhis first man and nutmegged\nthe second, Matty pulled the\nultimate playground trick\nout of his locker. Yes, the\nSri Lankan wizard knocked\nthe ball one side and ran\naround the other side of the\nlast defender, before slotting\ninto the corner to complete a\nbreathtaking treble of goals.\nHe might look like a goat, but\nboy this lad can play!\nAt seven-nil, the game was\nall but done. Certainly Carlos\ndid not deserve to concede,\nbut with an eye for symmetry,\nImperial saw it fitting to give\naway a last minute penalty,\nwhich provided the smallest\nof consolations to the medics.\nSo, seven-one again, maybe\nlightening does strike twice?\nWell, one thing is certain:\ncongratulations go to every\nImperial player, not one of\nwhom didn\u2019t play his opponent off the park.\nFinally, there is one serious\npoint that needs clearing up.\nThere has been a lot of talk\nof \u2018hating\u2019 medics. On behalf\nof Imperial firsts, I would\nlike to go on record as say-ing: we don\u2019t hate medics. In\nfact, we quite like them. After\nall, they\u2019re just footballers.\nAnd besides, we play them,\nwe beat them, we get three\npoints. If only we could play\nthem every week!\nVARSITY DAY 2005\nFOOTBALL\nComfortable win for Imperial football Firsts\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 3\nImperial Medicals\nMen\u2019s 2nd 1\nBy Ian Robinson\nMuch fuss has been made in\nrecent times of the supposed\nrivalry between Imperial\nCollege Football Club and\ntheir medic counterparts.\nWith a recent record, how-ever, of 15 victories and one\ndraw in IC\u2019s last 16 matches\nagainst the medics, the\nrivalry was beginning to look\nas one-sided as Arsenal\u2019s\nlocal rivalry with Leyton\nOrient. This was evident the\nprevious Saturday when IC\u2019s\nreserve team looked to have\nended any hopes of the medics being represented in ULU\nPremier League One with a\n4-0 demolition of their Firsts.\nWith this result in mind,\nIC\u2019s captain Pricey was a little worried that his players\nwere going soft and would\ntake pity on the medics\u2019\ninability to play football. In\norder to combat the problem,\nhe dropped many of his star\nnames and brought in some\nof IC\u2019s third team players to\nfreshen up the side.\nAfter a rousing team talk\nreminding the players of the\nimportance of winning the\ninaugural football Varsity\nmatch, the new look IC\nSeconds took to the pitch with\ntheir minds focused on the job\nat hand. It was expected that\nthe medics would be fighting equally hard to get their\nhands on the trophy for the\nfirst time, and this proved to\nbe the case during the opening exchanges. It wasn\u2019t long,\nhowever, before IC began to\nexert their superiority with\nCaruso uncharacteristically\nheading over when unmarked\nfrom six yards and Dom\nBooth forcing a good save\nfrom the opposition \u2018keeper.\nWhen the resulting corner\nwas not properly cleared,\nJohn Slavin took control of\nthe ball for IC before laying\noff for Andy Kosinski to volley\nhome exquisitely from a wide\nangle.\nWith a one goal lead, IC\nbegan to feel a little too comfortable and immediately\ntook their foot off the gas to\nallow the medics back into\nthe game. A well worked long\nthrow routine caused chaos\nin the IC box after it was\nnot properly cleared, and two\nmen appeared unmarked at\nthe back post to fight over\nwho would slot it home.\nThe next 15 minutes contained little drama as both\nteams sensed they could win\nthe game and fought over\nevery ball in the centre of\nthe park. IC finally edged\nahead with only a few first\nhalf minutes remaining, when\nJan Marchant took control\nof a Caruso pass inside his\nown half and went forward\nunchallenged before rifling\ninto the bottom corner from\naround 30 yards out. The\nscore remained two-one until\nhalf time.\nThe second half began\nwith a renewed effort from\nthe medics to get something\nfrom the game, but the tight\nIC defence kept them at bay\nwith solid work in particular\nfrom Will MacAdie and Tom\nTrump. A goal-line clearance\nfrom Caruso was the nearest\nthe medics came to scoring.\nAs the half drew on, the\nmedics began to tire and IC\nstarted to assert themselves\non the game thanks to some\nsolid work in centre midfield\nfrom Andy Easter and some\nteasing runs from substitute\nDal. A breakthrough finally\ncame for IC when some neat\nplay between Dal and Matt\nGready released John Slavin\nto calmly slot the ball home\nfrom 15 yards out. At this\npoint, the medics realised\ntheir dream was over and IC\ntook firm control. A cameo\nappearance from John Scott\nshould have yielded further\ngoals but twice he failed to\nhit the target when it seemed\nharder to miss.\nThe final result was probably a fair one and the medics should be commended\nfor their brave and spirited\ndisplay.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n19\nShall We Dance was originally a\nJapanese film that won a huge audi-ence, both in Japan and the western\nworld.\nThere are three things I utterly\ndespise when it comes to movies.\nNumber one: Hollywood remakes of\nsmall low-key productions that ruin\nthe warmth and small scale of the\noriginal film. Number two: romantic\ncomedies. Number three: Jennifer\nLopez. Therefore it was with an\nunderstandable sense of trepidation\nthat I entered the cinema to watch\na Hollywood rehash of a romantic\ncomedy with Jennifer Lopez.\nThe actual plot is surprisingly like-ableandmyoriginalsenseofimpend-ing doom vanished quite quickly.\nAlthough predictable and clich\u00e9d at\nmany, many points throughout the\nfilm, you find yourself actually enjoying it. The movie starts off with an\nintroduction to the very creatively\nnamed John Clark (Gere), an overworked businessman commuting to\nand from his office every day. He\narrives home every evening to his\ngraceful wife (Sarandon) and his two\nchildren and his dog but you get the\nimpression that everything in his life\nis pretty boring and predictable.\nAt the time of his latest birthday,\nClark is hit with a quiet midlife crisis that all men with a wife, 2.5 kids\nand a dog undergo, and he realises something is missing in his life\n(obviously tango lessons).\nBlankly staring outside the window of his train whilst commuting\nhome one day, Clark sees a beautiful\nyoung woman (er... Lopez) staring\nout of one of the windows above a\nsign for a dance academy. Intrigued\nby her solitude, the tortured look in\nher eyes and obviously her figure,\nClark madly stumbles off the train\nand enrols in the dance academy to\nget closer to her.\nClark\u2019s plan backfires \u2013 he is\ninstead taught ballroom dancing by\nMiss Mitzy (Anita Gillette) whilst\nLopez, who is later known to be\na dancer named Paulina, remains\naloof and cold \u2013 in her own words:\n\u201cI prefer not to socialise with students.\u201d\nFunnily enough, Clark turns out\nto have a hidden talent for danc-ing. What an amazing coincidence.\nAlso very unpredictably so, his wife\ngets suspicious of her husband\u2019s\nabsences from the house and suspects that her husband is having an\naffair. Clich\u00e9d? No, not at all.\nThe performances by the cast are\nstrong \u2013 Gere fits in quite nicely as\nthe middle-aged man with everything but that crucial something,\nand Sarandon\u2019s portrayal of the\nunsaid but still strong love that\nexists between a middle-aged married couple is exquisite. In fact, the\nentire cast perform consistently well\nand deliver strong performances,\nreally bringing their characters to\nlife.\nThe entire cast, that is, apart from\nJennifer Lopez. It appears that in\nher attempt to fit into her character\u2019s role as aloof and detached,\nshe has taken it a little too far and\nappears wooden and impassive \u2013\nindeed, you would be forgiven for\nmistaking her in some scenes for\nher wax reproduction in Madame\nTussauds. One commendable point\nthat cannot go overlooked, however,\nis that her dance scenes with Gere\nwere completely flawless. The lady\ncan move \u2013 I\u2019ll give you that \u2013 and\nso can Gere!\nOverall, this is not a bad movie to\nwatch if you don\u2019t want to involve\nthe use of a single brain cell. It\nis mind-numbingly predictable\nand clich\u00e9d every step of the way,\nand some scenes are slow-moving.\nHowever, the characters are definitely novel and engaging, and I am\nsure Jennifer Lopez\u2019s inclusion in\nthe film will certainly have a part to\nplay in the film\u2019s grossing at the box\noffices.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005 5\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nRecently, while splayed out\non the chilly floor of the\nSomerset House ice rink, it\noccurred to me that my skating abilities might improve if\nI understood a little more of\nthe science.\nLet me tell you up front in\ncase you harbour vague hopes\nof rescuing gauche and mediocre ice rink performance by\nreading this article: knowing\nthe science will not save you\nfrom your cold watery doom.\nBut, fear not, such knowledge\nwill almost certainly deepen\nyour ice skating experience\nand after all, isn\u2019t a richer,\nmore enjoyable encounter\nwith the substance what it is\nall about?\nThe reason ice skating can\nbe so much fun is because ice\nhas a uniquely low coefficient\nof friction, which is why skaters can glide so effortlessly\nacross it. So the prime ques-tion, then, for any aspiring\nscientific ice skating enthusiast is: what makes the ice so\nslippery in the first place?\nThe pressure myth\nexposed\nThe classic explanation was\nto attribute it to pressure.\nThe pressure of the skate\nblade was said to melt the\nsurface of the ice, causing\na small layer of water to be\nformed. This created a lubri-cant, lowering friction. When\nthe pressure was removed,\nit was thought the ice froze\nover again.\nCertainly it sounded pretty\nplausible and for a number\nof years no-one much bothered to investigate. Certainly\nit is true that increasing the\npressure on ice will lower\nits freezing point. When you\nput pressure on ice, you are\nessentially trying to squeeze\nit into a smaller space.\nBecause water takes up less\nspace than ice, the liquid\nform becomes more favourable than the solid form. The\nmore pressure, the greater\nthe inclination for the ice to\nbecome water. The property\nmanifests itself in the lowering of the freezing point when\nice is exposed to high pres-sures.\nBut while all this is eminently sensible, it is not enough to\nexplain why ice is slippery.\nThe problem is that it\nrequires enormous pressures to lower the freezing\npoint of water significantly.\nConsider a simple calcula-tion. Now I don\u2019t want to give\naway my life ambitions, but\nlet\u2019s suppose I am an Olympic\nchampion figure skater with\na mass of 60kg (plus three\ngold medals). My sharp skate\nhas 2cm\u00b2 of contact area. The\nentire pressure exerted by\nmy skate is only just under\n30 atmospheres. Which, when\nyou apply something called\nthe solid-liquid coexistence\ncurve in the water phase dia-gram, equates to a temperature drop of only a few tenths\nof a degree.\nIndeed, it turns out that you\nneed to apply a pressure of\nabout 120 atmospheres just\nto lower the freezing point\nof water by 1\u00b0C. Note also\nthat 120 atmospheres of pressure would likely shatter the\nice! So according to this theory you would only be able to\nskate on ice which was just\nbelow freezing. But the ice we\ngenerally skate on is much\ncolder at below \u20135\u00b0C.\nIf it is a bit early in the\nmorning for all this, just think\nof light objects like hockey\npucks or small children. They\ncan glide as frictionlessly as\nadults. If pressure was the\nreason for slippery ice, this\nsimply wouldn\u2019t be so.\nThe current theory\nSo what is going on? The prob-lemseemstohavebeensolved\nin the late 1990s by a chemist,\nGabor Somarjai, and a physi-cist, Michel Van Hove, of the\nLawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory in California, who\nstudied the slipperiness of ice\non an atomic scale.\nAccording to them, the ice\nitself is intrinsically slippery.\nYou don\u2019t need to melt the ice\nto skate on it because the ice\nhas a \u2018quasi-fluid layer\u2019 that\ncoatsthesurfaceandprovides\na permanent lubricant. When\npressure is applied, the molecules in the layer compact\ninto underlying interstices, or\nspaces in the ice structure,\nand create a smooth surface\nfor easy gliding.\nThe \u2018quasi-fluid layer\u2019 is not\nactually liquid water but ice\nmolecules vibrating very rap-idly. The ice molecules have\nan unusually high degree of\nvibrational motion, several\ntimes that of the molecules\ndeeper in the bulk of the ice.\nBut importantly it is only in\none direction, up and down.\nIf the atoms moved from side\nto side, the \u2018quasi-fluid layer\u2019\nwould literally become liquid\n(which is what happens above\n0\u00b0C).\nSomorjai and Van Hove\ninvestigated the phenomenon using a technique\ncalled electron diffraction.\nThey bombarded a thin layer\nof ice with a stream of elec-trons. Detectors recorded the\nangles and velocities of the\nelectrons reflecting the ice.\nSurprisingly, they didn\u2019t follow the simple trajectories\nexpected of an object bouncing off a solid state. Instead\nthey were scattered, as if hitting a constantly changing\nsurface.\nThe \u2018quasi fluid layer\u2019\nmay be thicker or thinner\ndepending on the tempera-ture. Lower temperatures\ngive rise to fewer layers\nwhereas if the ice is warmer,\nthe number of slippery layers\nincreases. At around \u201320\u00b0C\nthe ice drastically decreases\nin slipperiness so it just about\nresembles any other solid. At\njust under \u2013160\u00b0C, the layer\nis as little as one molecule\nthick.\nAs to why ice is so slippery\ncompared to other solids, this\nis thought to be because the\nchemical bonds that hold the\nwater molecules together are\nmuch weaker than the bonds\njoining other solids.\n\u2018Fast ice\u2019 vs \u2018slow ice\u2019\nThe phenomenon may help\nto explain the difference\nbetween \u2018fast ice\u2019 and \u2018slow\nice\u2019, terms sometimes used\nin ice hockey games. \u2018Fast\nice\u2019 is harder and colder with\na smoother surface, while\n\u2018slow ice\u2019 is warmer and soft-er. Hockey players generally\nprefer \u2018fast\u2019 ice because the\npassing and skating is easier.\nFigure skaters prefer softer\nice for their landings.\nBased on the theory, as\nthe ice temperate increases,\nskaters need to move through\na greater number of \u2018quasi\nfluid layers\u2019. Hence more friction occurs slowing the skater\ndown. The extra layers also,\nno doubt, cushion falls \u2013 even\nif you do still get wet.\nIce-skating: just how do skates glide on the surface of ice?\nThe science of ice skating\nIt\u2019s not too late to enjoy a traditional winter sport.

Fly\nhalf James Morris missed a\ndifficult conversion from wide\non the right.\nImperial almost hit back\nsoon afterwards, as Raphael\nDiguisto broke through but\nwas forced into touch.

This\ngame would prove to be a\nmuch closer affair.\nAfter a delayed kick-off\ncaused by an administrative\nblunder, the match started\nslowly with some unexpected\nImperial pressure. It soon\nbecame clear that the game\nwas going to be played at\nground level with both teams\nturning down the opportunity to convert penalties into\npoints.\nThe Medicals defended\nwell, led by Wino putting in\nsome thundering tackles in\nthe pack, and soon had the\nchance to take the offensive\nwith some strong running in\nthe centre. Unfortunately it\nsoon became clear that the\nMedicals would not be able\nto play their natural rucking\ngame, as the Imperial pack\nused their weight and support in defence to turn possession over on numerous\noccasions, resulting in the\nmedics squandering some\nstrong scoring opportunities.\nAs half time approached,\nthe Medicals\u2019 injuries started\nto take their toll. The Imperial\npack exploited holes in the\ntired defence and ran in a\nwell worked try which gave\nthem a deserved lead going\ninto the break.\nFive-nil down at half-time\nthe medics were forced to\nmake a number of key\nchanges to replace the battle-scarred players. Tactics were\nalso changed, to spin the ball\nwider and make use of the\nswift wingers.\nThe ball was kicked off into\nthe midfield, where it stayed\nfor half an hour with limited opportunities from both\nsides to break the stalemate.\nThe pack excelled at the set-pieces though and Craig and\nGary worked hard in the second row to help win some\ngreat line-out ball and control\nthe scrums.\nAs the final ten minutes\napproached, both teams were\nshowing signs of fatigue and\nthe medics took the opportunity to make some more substitutions and bring on fresh\nlegs. This resulted in some\nstrong pressure, set up by\nJames at scrum half, who took\nthe initiative to command the\nmidfield.

An anteriorly dislocated shoulder (the other one\nthis time, though) and a sub-luxed AC joint were an added\nbonus!\nThe conversion was missed\nand the scores were tied at\nfive each at full time.\nThe captains decided on a\nnail-biting extra time period\nof ten minutes each way.\nThe first half was dominated\nby medic possession but a\ncombination of exhaustion,\nfumbled balls and last ditch\nImperial defence meant the\never-growing crowd were in\nfor a finale similar in stature\nto the closing stages of the\nWorld Cup final!\nThe second half of extra\ntime continued in a similar\nfashion to the first, and the\nMedicals sensed that victory was there for the tak-ing.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nTraditionally,atthebeginningofeach\nyear, the music press go crazy over\nwho will be the \u2018next big thing\u2019. Last\nyear all the trendy magazines proph-esised the rise of Franz Ferdinand,\nwho have now gone on to take the\nworld by storm. But their predictions don\u2019t always come true \u2013 how\nbig are Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\nin comparison, for instance?\nSo far, we\u2019ve had two main bands\ncompeting for the most hype generated this year. There\u2019s the genuinely\nthrilling Bloc Party with their first\nrelease Silent Alarm, and now we\nhave the Kaiser Chiefs with their\ndebut, Employment. Success is\nalmost guaranteed for the Leeds\nfour-piece, having already been\ngiven the NME seal of approval in\nthe form of the \u2018Radar Award\u2019 at last\nweek\u2019s ceremony. But do they live up\nto their hype?\nIt all starts off reasonably well, with\nEveryday I Love You Less And Less,\na cheeky opener with its fuzzed-up\nkeyboards and ska rhythms, and its\ntalk of dumping someone whilst proclaiming \u201cAnd my parents love me /\nAnd my girlfriend loves me\u201d, leading\nyou to wonder how many girls he\u2019s\ngot hidden away. A slew of decent\ntracks follow on from this; there\u2019s\nthe explosive I Predict A Riot, which\ndespite previous reviews in this\npaper (see Felix 1301) is a great\nsong mapping out urban decay, and\nthe recent release Oh My God with\nits trippy verses building up into a\ncrashing chorus.\nA few tracks in, though, you\u2019ll get a\nnagging feeling that you\u2019ve heard it\nall before. It\u2019s not surprising, since in\ngeneral Employment plays as if the\nChiefs have been grave robbing the\nBritpop tomb rather then producing\nan original work. The influences are\neasy to spot: the aforementioned Oh\nMy God could have easily come from\na Beta Band album, Time Honoured\nTradition has Merseyside influences (Zutons, anyone?) and there\u2019s a\ngeneral throwback to any number of\njumpy mid-nineties bands.\nPillaging the past never harmed a\nband\u2019s career though \u2013 just ask any\nof the myriad of rock bands around\ntoday. You Can Have It All \u2013 one of\nthe standout tracks \u2013 is a beautiful\npiece of sixties-era pop in the vein\nof The Kinks and The Moody Blues,\nand Saturday Night (which features\nex-Blur guitarist Graham Coxon on\nthe motorbike, trivia fans) is a joyful\nhomage to Supergrass, with driving\nguitar lines and background \u2018oohs\u2019\nintact.\nSo are the Kaiser Chiefs worthy of\nthe hype they\u2019ve received? Well\u2026...\nes. No. Sort of. There\u2019s enough proof\nhere that the Kaisers know how\nto put together a catchy album,\nwith appealing hooks and flowing\nwordplay intact. But the fact that\nthey wear their influences heavily\non their sleeve stops this collection\nfrom becoming as memorable as it\ncould have.\nThe Kaiser Chiefs need to create\ntheir own unique niche before they\ncan start taking over the world.\nMatthew Hartfield\nAlbum covers tend to be a bit of a\ngiveaway: anything abstract generally means some weird or exciting new\nmusic; run of the mill artist pictures\nare intrinsic to follow ups of previous successes; whilst stark images\nand colours usually adorn dance\nacts\u2019 LPs. So what does the smould-ing grin of Portobella\u2019s half Italian\nfront women, Luciana Caporaso,\nbrandishing a broken microphone\nsuggest? Jumping to conclusions, I\nexpected some spoilt brat, wannabe\nlesbian making trashy, thrash metal\nwith howling banshee vocals. How\nwrong could I be.\nViva La Difference! is the badly\ntitled to-be-released album from\nPortobella, a variation on the name\nof one of the most famous markets\nin London. As one of the three bands\nwho were documented for MTV\u2019s\nBreak Point, they are looking for\na base from which to launch their\nalbum.\nTheir second single, the album\u2019s\ntitle track, was only released this\nmonth, apparently delayed due\nto huge club success, and follows\nCovered In Punk, Portobella\u2019s first\nsingle, which came out in summer\n2004. The song is a joyful mix of\nbubblegum vocals and naff guitars\nto Filthy/Gorgeous-style bass. Best\ndescribed as a pop cross between\nGuano Apes and Peaches, Portobella\nserves up synthetic backing to\ndreamy vocals and raucous rants.\nSpend The Night floats on synth-strings with dubious echoes of a\ndrum pad every ten seconds, showing a softer side to the group, compared to the \u2018in your face\u2019 approach\nof most of the album. The lyrics\naren\u2019t really supposed to mean anything (being aimed at clubbing) and\nare vaguely based on the title of\neach track \u2013 they are just another\ncomponent in the mix.\nAlmost a viable Eurovision entrant,\nthe sound of Portobella walks the fine\nline between acceptable and cheesy\neuropop, and could be considered as\nLondon\u2019s take on the Scissor Sisters,\nalthough not a touch on the camp\ngods of pop. Meet Me At The Y Bar\nis one of the highlights of the record:\nsupported by thick background\nfuzz, Caporaso sings loveable punky\nvocals carrying a pop chart melody\nnot seen since circa 1995.\nViva La Difference! appeals to\nyour childish side. Pop-princess\ntrack titles such as Freakin\u2019 In\nStereo and Spellbound reflect the\nweak songwriting and limited talents of the band, but there\u2019s a little\nsomething that manages to capture\nyour imagination. Like the rubbish\nbands from your childhood that you\nstill love although you know they are\nundeniably pants, Portobella have a\ntime and a place to be played, and as\nsuch fit the bill perfectly.\nIf you are looking for a blast of\ncheesy-electro-rock-pop to do the\nastro to in your room when no-one\nis looking, Portobella are the answer,\nalthough they won\u2019t keep you up all\nnight.\nNick Simpson\nIt seems like the end of an era.\nEvery week, a rock or rhythm and\nblues legend dies aged 60.\nMost recently, Doobie Brothers\ndrummer Kieth Knusden and couple of weeks ago, Jim Capaldi. One\nof the most innovative drummers\nof his time, Capaldi played with\nTraffic. Their album, John Barley\nCorn Must Die, was the first I ever\nfell in love with, instantly relating to\nthe jazz, blues and folk-influenced\nsongwriting. Somewhere between\nthen and now I discovered Hissing\nOf Summer Lawns by Joni Mitchell.\nAlthough it was the only album of\nhers I have ever got on with (the\neighties had a bad affect on her\nmusic), she found a niche and developed an original and easy-going jazz-ish sound.\nListening to Monade\u2019s new album,\nA Few Steps More, I was instantly\nreminded of Mitchell. The pseu-do-jazz backing almost verges on\nlounge but is saved from toppling\nover the edge by a twist of French\nlyrics and ambient links. The album\ncomes across as sleep music, lulling you into a false sense of comfort\nwherever you are but by the end is\nas boring as a party political broad-cast.\nPerhaps trying to expand on their\nfan base, the track listings not only\ninclude English and French titles,\nbut also Spanish and German; the\npoint of this isn\u2019t clear since all the\nsinging is blatantly French. Like\nRammstein, the foreign language\nvocals put the album in a different\nlight, which would probably be its\nsaving grace, if lead singer Laetitia\nSadler could muster up any vocal\nvariation. It\u2019s a far cry from her\nStereolab experience.\nThe music is nothing inspiring.\nThe organ-style Moog can be heard\non many tracks with jazzy drumming\nbreaks for inane keyboard solos. The\ndiversity between songs is about two\nbeats per minute, other than that\nit all merges to form a mass of\ngrey. Only one track past the upbeat\nopener of Wash And Dance has any\ncontinuity and finesse (Sensible Et\nExtensible), which is a pity since the\nalbum started with promise.\nI really can\u2019t get excited by this\nalbum, neither can I bring myself\nto dislike it. Being the middle-of-the-road LP it is, A Few Steps More\nwill fade into obscurity, being played\nat middle-class dinner parties up\nand down the country. Maybe they\nhaven\u2019t heard of Joni Mitchell but\nnow you have, you don\u2019t need to\nlisten to this poor adventure of the\nsame vein.\nNick Simpson\nSome such jazz (and indie)\nScene favourites the Kaiser Chiefs finally bring out their debut album, Monade\u2019s\npseudo-jazz stylings fail to impress, and Portobella don\u2019t cover us in punk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005\n14\nThe Kaiser Chiefs\nEmployment\n(B-Unique)\nHHHII\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe Kaiser\nChiefs: one of\nthem has a\ntambourine\nPortobella\nViva La Difference!\n(Island)\nHHIII\nFile under:\nSmart indie with classic influences\nIf you like this, try:\nThe Futureheads \u2013 The Futureheads\nFile under:\nPunky synth-pop\nIf you like this, try:\nAnnie - Anniemal\nMonade\nA Few Steps More\n(Too Pure)\nHHIII\nFile under:\nEasy-listening jazz\nIf you like this, try:\nFeist - Let It Die\nMonade: middle-class easy listening, apparently\n\n"

It contained the offending statement: \u201cReligious\npriests roamed the streets\nhanging people, accusing\nthem of heresy and blaming\nthem for the earthquake.\u201d\nA reporter for the Catholic\nExchange website has in the\nmeantime been investigating\nthiseventandfoundthatthere\nis \u2018no historical evidence\u2019\nfor priests having committed such acts. Consequently,\nthe site has accused The\nWashington Post, CBS News\nand Felix (amongst others)\nof \u2018journalistic un-integrity\u2019\nand running pieces that have\nmade \u2018highly inflammatory\nallegations\u2019. Since then, the\ndebate has spread to various\ninternet discussion baords.\nThe role of religion in genocide has always been contro-versial. The Iberian penin-sula, in particular, has had a\nnotorious history of priests\nordering heretics to be\nscythed in their thousands.\nThe Inquisition that began in\nthe 15th century and only officially ended in 1834 (when the\nlast burning took place) was\na period during which many\nthousands were killed and\neven more were subjected to\ntorture, usually on the basis\nof their religious beliefs and\nsometimes because they just\nlooked a bit odd.\nThis behaviour should not\nreflect in any way on the\nmodern church or its val-ues. The Pope has frequently\nackowledged \u201cmethods that\nhad nothing to do with the\nGospel\u201d. But the Catholic\nExchange website seem to\nbelieve that they have to\ndefend the repute of their\nreligion through the ages.\nThey clearly feel any slur on\nthe name of any priests in\nthe past is a slur on their\nentire religion today. But, in\ndefending the indefensible, in\nbeginning to identify with the\nbrutal religious regimes of\nthe past, they could become\na part of that history.\nThere are revisionists\nwho claim that the number\nof deaths inflicted by the\nInquisition has been vastly\nexaggerated. But, equally,\nthere are people who diminish the number of Jews\nkilled during the Holocaust.\nOn the one hand, you have\nmillions killed for the sake\nof purifying a religion, while\non the other hand millions\nwere killed purifying a race.\nIn both cases, revisionists\nattempt to reroute events to\nsuit their present day ideological ends. In both cases,\nthe crimes should never be\nforgotten.\nAt the same time, people\nliving today should not feel\nthat they have to apologise\nfor the actions of their ances-tors. They should learn from\ntheir mistakes and not repeat\nthem; to practice their religion without imposing their\nideas on other people through\nviolence.\nThroughout history, atrocities have been committed\nin the name of God. Kings,\nqueens and presidents have\nwaged war with a sword in\none hand and a \u2018holy book\u2019\nin another, proclaiming the\nwords of a prophet and impaling their next victim on a pike.\nIn the modern world, religion\nshould play a very different,\nless political role.\nUnfortunately, the articles\npublished on the website\ncompletely ignored the central thesis of my original\narticle, which was that natural disasters force people to\nquestion the nature of their\nown belief. Whether priests\nactually roamed the streets\nexecuting heretics in the\naftermath of the earthquake\nis really a moot point. It may\nbe nothing more than a myth,\nbut if so, it is a myth that\nhas gained a great deal of\ncredence, simply because it\ncarries with it a great deal of\nmeaning.\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Robin Wilkinson\nScience Communication\nWendy Brodie has just\nhad one of her remarkable\nachievements recognised. In\nbetween the everyday mini-miracles of marriage, teaching special needs children,\nand raising three kids of her\nown, she has managed to\ndesign and produce an inven-tion.\nThe Bodyflik is a cheap\nand simple device that is\nused to sweep water from\nyour body before using a\ntowel, meaning that your\ntowel stays warmer, drier\nand cleaner. It won a high\ncommendation at this year\u2019s\nannual British Female\nInventors and Innovators\nNetwork (BFIIN) Awards.\nYou may not have heard\nof them, but the BFIIN has\nbeen running the Awards for\nseveral years. Considering\nthat their manifesto states\nthat \u201cthe Awards were established in 1999 to provide inspiration for women seeking to\nturn their unique ideas into\ncommercial propositions\u201d, it\nseems a shame that there\nwas no fanfare and consequently a complete lack of\npublic awareness. In fact,\nthe only reason I know that\nthis event exists is because\nI stumbled across the BFIIN\nwebsite.\nThere is a lack of support\nfor those in the general public\nwho have bright ideas. This is\nunfortunate, as people with\neveryday experience are usually the best placed to see\nhow improvements and innovations could be made.\nWendy\u2019s tale begins in a\nvery normal way \u2013 having had\nan idea and thinking, \u201csomebody should really make\nthat,\u201d nothing much hap-pened. Nothing happened for\na while. This is where grassroots ideas frequently end up:\nsuspended in limbo in one\nperson\u2019s head. They do not\nhave the backing or knowhow\nto get the idea going.\nWendy was lucky: a string of\ncoincidences led her into conversation with the owner of\na plastic injection-moulding\nfactory, John Walters. John\nwas a self-made man and\ntherefore fully acquainted\nwith the struggles required\nto get an idea off the ground.\nThis gave him a sympathetic\ndisposition towards helping\nviable ideas get into produc-tion.\nAfter a year of hard work\nand setbacks, Wendy\u2019s idea\nwas made flesh and the first\norders were coming in. Ever\nsince, she has become more\naware of what support is out\nthere and the agencies that\nhelp people develop their\nideas.\nBut most people do not\nknow where these channels\nof help are. Wendy is hopeful that this may be about to\nchange \u2013 agencies and clubs\nare blossoming and becoming more accessible as the\npublic perception of inventors\nchanges from solitary individuals working alone in their\ngarden shed or attic to ordinary people who go to work.\nThis could make all the difference to other inventors who\nmay not have the luck and\npersonal support that Wendy\nhas had from her husband,\nIan.\nInventors\u2019 profiles will also\nbe raised as they are the subject of a new reality TV series,\nthe BBC\u2019s Dragons\u2019 Den.\nThis is surely the crest of an\noncoming wave, now that DIY\nand makeovers have been\ndone to death. Encouraging\nsuch innovation in Britain\nis a good thing \u2013 as Japan\u2019s\nMITI reports, British ideas\nhave accounted for 55% of the\nworld\u2019s inventions over the\nlast century, and those billions\nof pounds are lost every year\nwhen ideas are taken abroad.\nWith a new consciousness of\nour nation\u2019s bright sparks,\nperhaps more homegrown\nideas like the Bodyflik will\ndevelop.\nSuffice to say that Wendy\nis looking forward to the\nsummer months when\nthe Bodyflik should really take off. It is already\non sale through Ebay or\nwww.bodyflik.co.uk.\nThe BFIIN Awards are\norganised by the Global\nWomen Inventors and\nInnovators Network (GWIIN)\nand were held on Wednesday\n16 and Thursday 17 February\n2005.\nOrdinary women, extraordinary innovations\nIn 1633 Galileo was forced to kneel in front of the Inquisition and recant his belief in the\nCopernican planetary system.

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nThe last time I went to a party that\nhad been hyped as much as Type\u2019s\nfourth birthday was when I went to\nsee Fat Boy Slim at Turnmills last\nyear and I had a terrible time. The\nfact that I had flu was no help, but\nthe main problem was that there\nwere way too many people.\nThe Cross is a much smaller venue\nthan Turnmills, with about half the\ncapacity, and with a line-up including Audio Bullys, Seb Fontaine and\nDavid Guetta in the main room and\nsupport from the likes of Wes in\nroom 2, there was good reason to be\nworried that I might spend six hours\njammed between some fat, sweaty\nchav scum.\nMy girlfriend chatted up the promoter during the week and guaranteed us six guest list spots, but three\nof the party immobilised themselves\nlong before the security search\nbecame relevant. The rest of us\nwere pleased to find, however, that\nas \u2018guests\u2019 we were quickly ushered\ninside with the minimum of fuss.\nMy fears about overcrowding were\njustified as a constant flow of people\nbetween the rooms made it impossible to find a place to settle unless\nyou could handle the freezing wind\nin the garden. It is said that over\n50% of the people moving around in\na club have absolutely no idea where\nthey are going, and we spent most\nof the first hour just moping around\nand leaning against walls. However,\nonce the Audio Bullys took the decks\nwe were fortunate to find ourselves\nin an enclosed area adjacent to the\nmain room with convenient bar\naccess, comfy seats and more than\nenough room to move.\nI had never heard the Audio Bullys\nbefore, but their set really justified\ntheir billing and their name. The\ncrowd were driven to the point of\neuphoria by some uplifting funky\nhouse and then suddenly, without\nwarning, the Audio Bullys played\nWhat A Difference A Day Makes, a\nsong that sounds more like a lullaby\nand certainly had the less empa-thetically challenged declaring love\nfor new people. The pattern continued with a big drop followed by\n99 Red Balloons and finally Bang\nBang (Baby Shot Me Down) from\nthe Kill Bill soundtrack which made\nemotional wreckage of anyone who\nhad let the Bullys get on top.\nSeb Fontaine was next up and\nalthough his set was typically profi-cient, the club was still very crowded and I was interested in saving\nenergy for the last action in the\nmain room provided by French DJ,\nDavid Guetta.\nDavid Guetta has burst onto the\nforefront of the London club scene\nwith a residency at Type and regular slots at Turnmills\u2019 City Loud\nthanks to the overwhelming success\nof his Fuck Me I\u2019m Famous parties\nin Ibiza. At City Loud, he played\na flamboyant set including some\nfunked up electro and some lively\n4/4 house music that included some\ncatchy remixes of well-known tunes,\nand his performance at Type was\nslick and classy. Guetta whetted the\ncrowd\u2019s appetite for some old skool\nwith Smack My Bitch Up but the\nset did not really get into full flow\nuntil about 5am when he savagely\ndropped Josh Wink\u2019s Higher State\nof Consciousness.\nThe high was sustained as a series\nof uplifting diva tracks were reeled\noff, including some of Guetta\u2019s own\nwork such as last summer\u2019s Ibiza\nhit Stay.\nAs the night drew tantalisingly\nto a close, the atmosphere in the\nmain room was electric and when\nthe promoter failed to bow to crowd\npressure to allow one more record,\nthe sense of disappointment was\npalpable.\nSome might say that Type is too\ncommercial and a bit cheesy and I\nhad my own doubts, but the venue\nturned out to be spot on and the\ndelivery of a few old favourites really topped off a quality night. As I\nwent into the club, the PR smugly\nboasted the quality of the line-up\nthey had that night. The next Type,\non Saturday 12 March, features Seb\nFontaine and Wes as well as the\nmulletted German superstar, Timo\nMaas. So that should be excellent\ntoo.\nOliver Richardson\nWhat\u2019s your type?\nIf you\u2019re looking for funky house then The Cross is...\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005\n16\nType Fourth Birthday\nThe Cross\nHHHHI\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFrench house-meister David Guetta\nSubdued? No, this is Sub Red...\nCLUB REVIEW\nYou might remember that last week\nI was telling you to get yourself\ndown to Sub Red. I did, and camera\nin hand I even managed to snap a\nfew of you bouncing around dBs in\nthe process.\nI had been sitting in the Union Bar\nfor a good few hours before the night\nhad even started, but was looking\nforward to the line up of DJs for the\nevening. First up were IC Radio\u2019s\nSpindle and Chug, not quite playing back to back but between them\ndropping some heavy tunes. Sadly,\nas is often the case at the Union,\nthe room was empty for the first\nfew hours. Stepping in and out now\nand then to check out the tunes, I\nwas impressed by the calibre of the\nmusic and the mixing on offer. It\u2019s\njust a shame there was hardly anyone around to hear it.\nAs the night progressed slowly,\npeople started arriving and filling\nthe place up. Spindle and Chug\u2019s\nset was followed by MacPherson.\nThe Union\u2019s Venue Manager, and\nthe brains behind the Sub Red\nnight, he\u2019s played at such places as\nsuperclub Fabric. His mixing style\nis damned fast and involves lots of\nquick chops and cuts between beats\nand tracks. Bouncy.\nThings rolled along nicely in terms\nof the music, and drum and bass\nsounds bloody good over dBs\u2019 new\nTurbosound PA system, complete\nwith big-ass bass bins to resonate\nyou inside and out. Gradually more\nand more people did arrive, though\nthe place was far from full. No matter though \u2013 as I always say, the\nemptier the room, the more space\nto dance around in! The people\nhere were clearly loving the music,\nand giving it plenty of the old D&B\nbounce and snap movements.\nFinally, headliner and Movement\nresident Bryan Gee put in an\nappearance. By this time, the place\nwas about as full as it was going to\nget, but there were enough people\nhere intent on partying that things\nlike that didn\u2019t really matter. Gee\u2019s\nset was suitably honed and enjoyed\nby all. The fact that there was vodka\nplus mixer for a pound a pop all\nnight was the icing on the cake of\nwhat turned out to be a top night.\nOk, so the place wasn\u2019t packed out,\nand as usual the male/female ratio\nwasn\u2019t so great, but in spite of those\nthings Sub Red is a quality night out\n\u2013 if nothing else it\u2019s a very cheap\npre-club outing. The only way it\u2019s\ngoing to get better is if more of you\ncan be arsed to spend time in your\nUnion. Make some effort and the\nonly way is up.\nSimon Clark\nNightlife Editor\nSub Red\nImperial College Union\nHHHII\nFile under:\nHouse, many Types\nIf you like this, try:\nCity Loud @ Turnmills\nBryan Gee (right) lays down the drum and bass for the Sub Red revellers at the Union last Friday.

Not until you\u2019ve\nseen this, a rivalry that both\ndivides and unites people\nfrom the grass it\u2019s played on\nright up to some of the top\nboardrooms in the world.\nThe Bottle Match, a rugby\nmatch played between the\nRoyal School of Mines (RSM)\nand the Camborne School\nof Mines is one of the fiercest and oldest fixtures in the\ncountry, if not the world.\nThe 2004-5 season marks\nthe 103rd year of this event,\nwith the first match occurring\nin 1902, which is thought to\nhave resulted in an honourable draw. More games were\nplayed between 1902 and 1920,\nthough records are not clear\nabout the results. Except\nfor the war years, however,\na match between Camborne\nand the RSM has been played\nevery year since 1921 (during\nthe war, RSM students were\nevacuated to Camborne and\nplayed for them!)\nThe fixture acquired its\nname in 1946 when some\nRSM students liberated a\ntwo foot high tin bottle off a\nBass-Charrington beer lorry.\nIt has been used as a running trophy ever since. The\nfirst \u2018Bottle Match\u2019, in 1946,\nwas won by Camborne by 11\npoints to 3, however the RSM\nwon it back the following year.\nIn 1947, \u2018the Bottle\u2019 was decorated with the crests of both\ncolleges.\nThe Bottle Match is the\nhigh point of both Camborne\u2019s\nand the RSM\u2019s year. Played\nalternatively in Cornwall and\nLondon, the matches are supported by vast and dedicated\ncrowds of current students\nand alumni. From those who\ncan\u2019t be there, messages of\ngood luck come in to the players in the week preceeding\nthe match, by letter, fax and,\nin this modern age, text and\nemail, from places as far away\nas Canada, Australia and\nSouth Africa! Though both\ncolleges have undergone turmoil recently with the changes to the faculty structure\nat Imperial and the movement of Camborne School of\nMines to Falmouth, one thing\nremains: the spirit of these\ntwo unique institutions, represented at this most special\nof occasions.\nSince the 1950s, players on\nthe winning side have been\npresented with personal tankards from the South African\nbased company Union\nCorporation/Gencor. This\ntradition continues, with the\ntankards provided by Michael\nWest and the Mining Journal.\nSuch presentations provide\na lifetime remainder of winning the bottle and are much\nappreciated by the players.\nThe Bottle Match is now a\npositive festival of sport as,\nover the last century, football\nand hockey have being added\nto the weekend\u2019s fixtures.\nMost recently, squash has\nalso been added on the Friday\nnight. Apparently, the first\nsquash match occured when\na couple of players made the\nmistake of turning up to the\nbar one night with squash\nrackets \u2013 and so a tradition\nwas born. In the near future\nwe hope to add golf and a boat\nrace (though only across the\nSerpentine!)\nA recent results roundup\nshows that RSM rugby are\non an eight Bottle Match\nunbeaten run.

    "content": "We first join Dan Foreman (Dennis\nQuaid) as the Head of Marketing\nat Sports America. He has dedicated 21 years of his life to the\nmagazine and has managed to gain\nquite a good reputation in marketing\nthrough building relationships with\nhis clients.\nUnbeknown to Dan, Sports\nAmerica has been taken over by\ncorporate giant globe.com and,\ndespite his years of experience, he\nwill soon be demoted to Assistant\nHead. Further adding insult to inju-ry, his replacement, Carter Doryea\n(Topher Grace), has no experience\nin marketing and is only half Dan\u2019s\nage. Doryea is a business school\nprodigy, and he changes the department of marketing by introducing\ncorporate synergy to boost ad sales\nin Sports America.\nThis is an unfortunate moment\nfor Dan to be demoted because his\nwife (Marg Helgenberger) is expecting another baby, and his daughter,\nAlex (Scarlett Johansson) has transferred to a more expensive college,\nNew York University. Therefore,\ndespite the embarrassment and the\nfact that he disapproves of Doryea\u2019s\nmethods, Dan has to stay in his job\nand become Doryea\u2019s \u2018wingman\u2019.\nThings aren\u2019t exactly a bed of\nroses for Doryea either. He is an\neager achiever who thinks that his\nlife will all be sorted out the minute\nhe achieves his promotion.\nHowever,disasterstrikes.Doryea\u2019s\nwife of seven months leaves him,\nand he soon realises that, in his\neagerness to achieve, he is left with\nno friends. He tries to make friends\nin the company, but it\u2019s difficult due\nto corporate cutbacks. He manages\nto build quite an odd relationship\nwith Dan, despite Dan\u2019s opposition.\nHe gets to know the Foreman family,\nand meets Dan\u2019s tomboyish daughter Alex.\nThere is an instant attraction\nbetween Alex and Doryea. Since\nAlex has just transferred to NYU,\nthey manage to keep the relationship a secret from Dan. However, at\nDan\u2019s birthday party, the cat is let\nout of the bag.\nIn Good Company is actually\nbased on a phenomenon happening in our world today \u2013 corporate takeovers, cutbacks and the\nold being replaced with the new.\nNevertheless, the movie manages\nto avoid becoming a documentary\ncondemning corporate takeover, by\nallowing the viewers to look through\nthe lenses of Dan and Doryea.\nThrough Dan\u2019s perspective,\nwe manage to observe the negative effects of corporate takeovers.\nHowever, the movie focuses on\nDan\u2019s family troubles, which make\nhim seem more realistic to the view-ers. The movie also makes fun of\nDoryea\u2019s awkwardness and vul-nerability, to make the character\nmore endearing to the audience.\nTherefore, the plot becomes more\nunpredictable as the audience is not\nled to favour either Dan or Doryea.\nThe introduction of Alex and\nDoryea\u2019s relationship is another\nbrilliant mind-twister in the plot. A\nconsiderable amount of the movie\nis dedicated to showing how their\nrelationship develops. It helps\nthe audience view Doryea as the\nlonely, needy, confused young man\nthat he really is. Their relationship\nalso adds a softer, feminine appeal\nto the movie which helps it relate\nto both female and male audiences\ndespite the story focusing on the\ntwo men.\nThe casting for this movie is bril-liant. Dennis Quaid slips into his role\nas the fatherly businessman as if the\npart was written for him. Topher\nGrace plays the fresh-faced eager\nachiever to perfection. However,\nthe movie doesn\u2019t manage to bring\nout the acting talents of Scarlett\nJohansson.\nOverall, In Good Company is a\nsurprisingly good movie. Surprising\nbecause it has a down-to-earth\ntheme which manages to shine\ndespite the high-flying conspiracy\ntheories we have grown used to.\nIt has a strong and unpredictable\nstoryline, and is definitely a movie to\nkeep you \u2018in good company\u2019.\nAngela Yuen Lee\nLooking for good company?\nDennis Quaid plays a middle-aged ad exec faced with a new boss who\u2019s nearly half his\nage... and who also happens to be sleeping with his daughter\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005\n18\nIn Good Company\nDirector: Paul Weitz\nStarring: Dennis Quaid, Topher\nGrace, Scarlett Johansson,\nMarg Helgenberger\nLength: 110 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHHHI\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nMen and their balls...\nEver get the feeling you\u2019re being played?\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all had that feel-ing. The feeling of pure contentment\nwhen we observe something that\ngoes to plan. Every little detail fits\nnicely into place. Two such examples\nof what I\u2019m describing are Ocean\u2019s\nEleven and Catch Me if You Can.\nWatching these films and seeing\nthese con men cheating people out\nof their money is very satisfying to\nwatch. Why is this so, if it is obviously wrong? I believe it\u2019s because they\nlook so smooth when they\u2019re ripping\npeople off. No panicking, no sweat,\nthey\u2019re just cool at what they do and\nyou can\u2019t help but admire them and\nwant them to get away with it.\nCriminal is the latest film released\ninto the con man genre and takes a\nslightly different approach. Richard\nGaddis (John C Reilly) takes the\nrole of the professional con man. He\nknows the tricks of the trade and\nis looking for a new partner in the\nbusiness. Luckily he finds just the\nright man in the form of a desperate Mexican named Rodrigo (Diego\nLuna). Richard manages to rescue\nRodrigo from a failed attempt to rip\noff a casino waitress and takes him\nunder his wing.\nDesperately needing money to\npay off his father\u2019s gambling debt,\nRodrigo decides to stick around to\nlearn a few things and profit from\nRichard\u2019s experience. It eventually\nbecomes clear that Rodrigo has a\ngift that Richard doesn\u2019t have, priceless in the con man world. He looks\nlike a nice guy. They both find that in\norder to make the big bucks they\u2019ll\nhave to rely on one another.\nHowever, when the chance to\nmake it big comes along by selling\na fake of the most valuable piece\nof antique currency in America\nto wealthy media tycoon William\nHannigan (Peter Mullan), Richard\nand Rodrigo need to play their cards\nright every step of the way. They\nagree to split the three quarters\nof a million between them, but can\nRodrigo really trust a professional\ncon man?\nCriminal lacks the big names that\ncan be found in the Ocean\u2019s Eleven,\nbut to be honest I think this isn\u2019t\nreally a big name movie. Reilly does\na good job as the con man and Luna\ncarries the part of the inexperienced\nsidekick very well. I found the distrusting relationship between these\ntwo rather amusing to watch and\nadding a little something extra that\nother films of this sort possess.\nThe plot is strong (although basic)\nall the way through, and is easy to\nfollow so you won\u2019t have to struggle\nto keep up with what\u2019s going on.\nThis might not be everyone\u2019s cup of\ntea, but I\u2019d had a long day.\nAnother aspect of the film which\nI enjoyed was that it showed how\nthings don\u2019t ever go exactly as\nplanned, since along the way to making their sale to Hannigan, Richard\nand Rodrigo find in order to succeed\nthey need the help of more and more\nindividuals who catch on to their\ndirty scam and who each want a\nshare of the money.\nFrankly I can\u2019t say there was\nanything I hated about the film. It\nwasn\u2019t amazing and will never be\nan epic but honestly, there are far\nworse ways to spend an hour and a\nhalf at the cinema.\nStephen Smith\nCriminal\nDirector: Gregory Jacobs\nStarring: John C Reilly, Diego Luna,\nMaggie Gyllenhaal, Peter Mullan\nLength: 88 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHIII\n\u201cQuaid slips into his\nrole as if the part\nwas written for him\u201d\nMaggie Gyllenhaal, Jake\u2019s little sister!\nListings: page 13\n\n"

Science\nMuseum library staff also\nprotested to highlight problems caused by the planned\ntransfer of most of their\nmulti-million pound collection\nto Imperial College, and the\nrelated job losses.\nInterviewed on the picket\nline, Emily Boise, negotiations officer for the union\nProspect, called the 2.5%\npay offer \u201cunacceptable\u201d,\nand \u201cwell below inflation and\noffers made by other museums\u201d. In an official statement,\nthe museum countered that\nthe 2.5% offer was in line with\ninflation over the 12 months\ncovered, and that rises above\ninflation had been granted in\nprevious years.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s disgusting that\nyou should do this during\nhalf term,\u201d shouted on irate\nvisitor outside the museum.\n\u201cI\u2019ve come all the way from\nPortsmouth with my son to\nhelp him research a GCSE\nproject,\u201d he continued.\nChris Chilvers, branch\nsecretary of Prospect at the\nmuseum,blamedthemanage-ment. \u201cThey\u2019ve known about\nthis strike for over a month,\u201d\nhe claimed, \u201cbut have chosen\nto keep it quiet.\u201d\nChilvers went on to explain\nthat the immediate cause of\nthe strike, the dispute over\npay, was the last straw in\nwhat he sees as a string of\nproblems caused by mismanagement and government\nunderfunding.\n\u201cWe think there has been\ndreadful mismanagement of\nthis museum,\u201d he says, citing\na recent large-scale restructuring as a prime example.\n\u201cMany staff feel that they\nwere wrongly re-graded. It\ncreated a lot of bitterness,\u201d\nhe claims, adding that it compounded the problems caused\nby the lack of any systematic\npromotions procedure at the\nmuseum.\nThe official museum statement argues that the restructuring actually served\nto bring pay at the museum\nfrom some of the lowest in\nthe museums sector up to the\nnational average.\nDespite their differences,\nboth sides seem to agree\nthat the major underlying\nproblem is government\nunderfunding. The museum\nclaims to have lost almost\n\u00a38m in government funding\nsince 1997. According to the\nprotestors, this had led to the\nclosure of ten galleries, eight\npermanently.\nThe current crisis over\nownership of the library col-lection, which is housed at\nImperial\u2019s central library, was\nprecipitated by a massive rise\nin the rent Imperial charges\nto the Science Museum for\nuse of space for its collection.\nAs the museum cannot afford\nto pay, Imperial has offered a\ncompromise whereby it will\ntake control of around 65% of\nthe library, with the remainder being split between the\nmuseum and the British\nlibrary.\nOne of the protestors,\nmuseum-library liaison officer Nick Wyatt, claims that\nloss of the museum library\ncould compromise open public access to the collection.\nIn addition to threatening the\njobs of science museum staff,\nthe resultant loss of expertise could cause problems for\nthe many students and staff\nwho use the collection and\narchives.\nClare Jenkins, Director of\nLibrary Services at Imperial\nCollege, counters that the\nincreaseinImperial\u2019scharges\nwas simply designed to bring\nthe charges to the museum in\nline with those paid by College\ndepartments. She adds that\nImperial has given a commitment to continue to allow\nopen public access to the collections after the transfer.\nScience Museum staff protest against an \u201cunacceptable\u201d pay offer, alleged mismanage-ment, job losses and a massive rise in rent charged by Imperial College for library space\nCrisis at the Science Museum\nImperial at the height of fashion\nTwo students model clothes at the Imperial College Fashion Show, held in aid of Macmillan Cancer Relief\nBy Dave Edwards\nProminent designers such as\nBoyd and Calvin Klein put\ntheir creations on show at\nSunday\u2019s Imperial College\nFashion Show, held in aid of\nMacmillan Cancer Relief.\nThe event, which sold out in\nadvance, was held at Sketch\nin Conduit Street, Mayfair, a\nfantastic venue well ahead of\nits time.\nAll the clothes were modelled by Imperial students,\nand some students\u2019 own\ndesigns were also exhibited\nat the show.\nCollections included \u2018For\nFreetime\u2019, based on urban\nstreetwear; \u2018For Playtime\u2019,\nmostly featuring underwear;\n\u2018Sometime\u2019, with wedding out-fits; \u2018Our Time\u2019, designed by\nImperial students; and \u2018Night\nTime\u2019, featuring evening\nwear.\nMacmillan Cancer Relief is\na UK charity that works to\nimprove the quality of life for\npeople living with cancer.

As there is no ICSM\nwomen\u2019s rugby team, the\nmedics and non-medics usually play on a team together\n(as the Virgins), but for the\nsake of Varsity tradition we\nsplit ranks to play seven-a-side rugby.\nDue to a few injuries, and a\nfew less regular players, the\nmedics recruited some help\nfrom Cocky and Sala, who\nhave played for the Virgins\nbefore, and Jennie who\nplayed her virgin match.\nCaptain Felix\u2019s mum was also\npresent to watch her daughter play rugby for the first\ntime.\nFrom the beginning, there\nwas early pressure from\nFelix\u2019s medic side. Good\nphase play led to an early\nscore by Cocky from the wing.\nShe then missed the conver-sion, but the medics were up\nfive-nil.\nAfter the restart, IC captain\nGump and her team applied\ngood pressure until a turnover forced Killer to race back\nto make an excellent cover\ntackle and deny Udders a\nscore. Unfortunately for the\nIC girls, Spandex is rarely\nkept out at such short range,\nand she got the second score\nfor the medics, which sent\nthem to half time leading ten-nil.\nAt the beginning of the second half, Udders was called\nto the medics\u2019 three-man\nscrum as Captain Kitty was\noff thanks to the rolling substitute system. This call was\nobviously a good one for the\nmedics as more pressure\ntowards the IC line ensued,\nresulting in a virgin try under\nthe posts for medics debu-tante Jennie.\nThe medics continued to\npush IC for the remainder of\nthe match, making good use\nof a forced overlap to send\nScotch over for a final try\nnear the end. Despite the\nattempts of the IC team to\nsnatch a try in the dying seconds with a canny chip for-wards, the match was over\nall too soon with the medics\nvictorious 20-0.\nIn the end, Cocky was voted\nmedics player of the match,\nand Gump and Killer shared\nthe honours for the defeated\nIC team. Fineage ensued with\nvirgin pints also consumed by\nCherrypicker for last week\u2019s\ndefeat at LSE and Jennie for\nher virgin match and virgin\ntry.\nHere\u2019s hoping this new\nevent can be continued at\nnext year\u2019s Varsity!\nVARSITY DAY 2005\nRUGBY SEVENS\nVirgins split for\nVarsity sevens contest\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nImperial Medicals\nMen\u2019s 2nd 1\nBy Pikey\nImperial had prepared so\nwell... what could possibly go\nwrong? Relegation from our\nBUSA league the previous\nSunday against Kent after\nsome dubious umpiring in\ndeepest darkest Canterbury\nhad left us highly motivated\nto restore at least some\npride to our season by beating Imperial Medicals Second\nXI.\nIndeed, the Wednesday\nbefore the Varsity game\nhad been excellent prepara-tion, having salvaged a last\ngasp three all draw against\nReading Seconds with a typical \u2018cometh the hour, cometh\nthe man\u2019 goal from Pikey from\nabout 30cm out.\nAnd so it was that on 16\nFebruary the Seconds\nmet at noon for the quick\ndash to Harlington aboard\nMothercare\u2019s yellow fun-bus\nfor our 1.30pm pushback. We\ncompleted our now legendary\ndynamic stretching warm-up, including sumo stretch-ing, much to the assembling\ncrowd\u2019s amusement including\none exceptionally loud medic\ngirl who seemed to think she\nwas a comic genius on the\nmegaphone. Yes, we did have\na girl playing for us\u2026 well\nspotted, and don\u2019t give up the\ndegree, love!\nAnd so to the game... as\nusual the umpires should\nhave gone to Specsavers,\nbut apart from that it was a\nclosely fought encounter with\nsome nice play from both\nteams and plenty of healthy\nbanter from the sidelines.\nFrom what I can remember it\ninvolved a lot of Imperial possession and some awesome\ndefence particularly from\nTyson, who, despite the abuse\nraining in from the sidelines,\nstood up and took it like a\nwoman despatching attack\nafter attack to the safety of\nthe sideline.\nItalian Job, Mr Potato Head,\nDribbles and the Imperial\nlegend that is Muff Daddy\nmeant the defence looked\nimpenetrable. Mothercare\nand Brandon Lee attempted\nto boss the midfield with their\nown special style of whinging,\nmuch like the rest of the sea-son. Still, consistency sometimes pays!\nThe wide men, FCUK, our\nsecret foreign import which\nnearly blew the club\u2019s already\noverstretched budget, and\nJames Howard, attempted\nto probe and unsettle their\ndefence. Up front, Pikey\nlooked isolated at times but\nstill succeeded in injuring at\nleast one of their players with\nhis usual unorthodox tack-ling.\nAndreas and Tight Lips kept\nthe bench warm, essential on\nsuch a cold day, and rolled\non and off for various players as the legs tired. In goal,\nAlex, fresh from being called\nto the centre circle before\npushback at Canterbury to\ncheck that he wasn\u2019t a girl\nwith his golden flowing locks\nthe Sunday before, was as\nsolid as ever.\nBoth teams had some really\ngood chances, but the respective defences kept the opposition at bay. However, despite\nMuff Daddy\u2019s sliding tackles,\nDribbles\u2019 awesome charging\ndown of short corners and\nTyson\u2019s general \u2018nobody gets\nthrough me\u2019 attitude, eventually the medics carved open\nan opportunity following\na short corner and scored,\nsending their supporters into\nwild jubilation.\nImperial fought back hard\nand dominated the second\nhalf and thought we might\nget back into it. We nearly\ndid. Brandon Lee\u2019s drag\nflick was heading goalwards\nwith the \u2018keeper beaten all\nends up only for it to smash\ninto Pikey\u2019s arse as he ran\ntowards goal.\nAnd so it wasn\u2019t to be. Fair\nplay to the medics and they\nprobably deserved to win, if\nonly because they took their\nchance when it came. Well\ndone to all those who took\npart.\nMedicals claim slender\nbut deserved hockey win\nVARSITY DAY 2005\nHOCKEY\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 2\nImperial Medicals\nWomen\u2019s 1st 1\nBy Hannah Marshall\nLadies\u2019 hockey has historically seen some bitter battles fought between these two\nImperial teams. Inkeeping\nwith recent form, history\nrepeated itself with Imperial\nemerging outright winners.\nThe first half saw Imperial\ndominating play, stringing\ntogether some smooth moves\nandpassingeffectivelyaround\nthe determined medic side.\nImperial remained frustrated\nby a solid medics defence,\nhowever, and only managed\nto capitalise on one of their\nmany onslaughts on goal,\nmaking it 1-0 at half time.\nAn out of the blue reply\ncame shortly after half time\nfrom the medics, who caught\nImperial on the break to bring\nit back level.\nEnraged Imperial players\nthen pushed up the pace,\ncreating a plethora of great\ngoal-scoring opportunites,\nagain denied by an impressive medic goalkeeper who\nkept them in the match.\nEventually the breakthrough\ncame, and Imperial crept one\nin. It wasn\u2019t until they were\ncelebrating the goal and getting ready for the restart that\nthe umpire reversed his deci-sion, pressured by the medics defence, who disputed\nwhether the ball had crossed\nthe line or not. So it was still\none-one!\nAs a consolation, the\numpire gave a penalty stroke\nto Imperial, which was saved\nby the \u2018keeper. Imperial\nremained unfazed and convinced that, with all their\ndomination, another goal\nwould come, and indeed it\ndid. Within seconds of the\nrestart of play, Imperial\nworked some magic and beat\nthe Medics \u2018keeper at last,\nproving that they were worthy of a victory.\nMore pressure ensued and\nthe chances kept on coming.\nThe medics were confined to\ntheir defensive half for the\nmajority of the match, until an\nunfortunate incident saw two\nof their players run into each\nother. One suffered an injury\nto her neck and was taken\naway in an ambulance (we\u2019re\nglad to report that she\u2019s OK\nnow) and the match was then\nconceded by the medics with\nten minutes remaining on the\nclock.\nOverallthiswasanemphatic\nvictory for Imperial, with a\nmisleadingly close score.\nWe look forward to the next\nclash!\nImperial women\ntriumph despite\nbizarre umpiring\nVARSITY DAY 2005\nHOCKEY\nFancy doing some\nvolunteering?\nWhy not get active in the community whilst you\u2019re at Imperial\nCollege London?

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005\n8\nColumns felix@ic.ac.uk\nSo, apparently there\u2019s some sort of\nfriction between Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine and Imperial\nCollege. Why is it that both sides\nseem to think the other side are\ncomplete losers? But most impor-tantly, who\u2019s to blame?\nBoth sides have reasonable argu-ments. Well, they would be reasonable if they were true. The medic\nargument is that Imperial is full of\nsad idiots who do nothing but work\nand look at computer screens all\nday. The aforementioned sad idiots\ndo not like washing and definitely\ndo not know what girls look like...\nor maybe a few of them actually\nare girls. The Imperial argument is\nthat all medics are stupid, arrogant,\npublic school boys. Now can anyone\nsee where the arguments fall down?\nNo? Really?\nRight, well I think it comes down\nto stereotypes, and also the people\nyou notice. Who do you notice when\nyou\u2019re walking down the street? The\nnormal people, the loud obnoxious\npeople, or the losers? That\u2019s right,\nyou notice the people who are out\nof the ordinary. The vast majority of\npeople, on both sides of the fence,\nare ordinary, nice people \u2013 the people you said hello to on your first\nday, before the seething rivalries\nsank their teeth into you and pulled\nyou apart.\nNow I\u2019m not saying that rivalries\naren\u2019t good. They are great for keeping spirit alive in the university, and\nfor giving a little bit of light-heart-ed competition and banter (or not\nso light-hearted in the case of the\nVarsity match, as was so helpfully\ndemonstrated by the supporters last\nWednesday evening). But seriously,\ndo you really want a football derby\natmosphere? With riots breaking\nout, screaming children, and burning houses? I thought not, but if\nyou\u2019re not careful, it could very well\nhappen at the next sports night; and\nnot just in your own befuddled head.\nSo, in order to try to stop such a\nthing, let\u2019s look at the arguments...\n1. Imperial students are sad losers\nwho do nothing but book work and\nlook at computer screens all day.\nIt\u2019s difficult to accuse someone\nof that when they are in the pub\nwith you. It\u2019s especially difficult to\nget into a drunken fight with one\nof them. Yes, some people do work\nextremely hard and do not tend to\nventure out into the wild world of\nsocialising. However, these people\nare few and far between \u2013 if they\ndon\u2019t socialise they cannot breed,\nand so gradually over the years this\nspecies has gently hit a dead end. An\nevolutionary cul de sac, perhaps.\nBut still, Imperial cannot be that\ndull if Brian May did physics here.\nJust remember, that complete \u2018loser\u2019\nwho never leaves his room might\nwell be writing the next Bohemian\nRhapsody. Or he may be a serial\nkiller, whittling spinning tops out of\nhuman tibias. Best not to provoke\nthem.\nAll people who go to Imperial (all\nof it, including the medical school)\nare clever and quite swotty, so\nbefore the medics accuse Imperial\nof being sad, it\u2019s mirror time. Oh,\nand Imperial people tend to stop\nbeing a student earlier \u2013 by getting\njobs. Which means proper clothes. I\nwould love proper clothes!\n2. All medics are loud, vulgar,\nobnoxious, fat, stupid, rich snobs.\nNow, I think you\u2019ll find that most\nof those adjectives only apply to a\nselect group of people, who I will\nnot name (think of a club... begins\nwith R... ends in Y...), and even these\nguys and gals aren\u2019t exactly that bad,\nonly when they get drunk togeth-er. But nights when this happens\n(sports nights etc) are well publi-cised, and if you find that behaviour\noffensive, you can avoid the throngs\nof sweaty drunk men (or not, as you\nlike).\nThese guys are not always like\nthis, and most importantly they\naren\u2019t the majority. Even allowing\nfor that though, it\u2019s always fun to\nwatch them for a while, and sometimes it\u2019s nice to be part of such\nmayhem.\nOn the topic of stupidity, medics are not stupid \u2013 hell, they do\nhave to get some pretty good grades\nto get into Imperial, like everyone\nelse here. They may not have the\nin-depth knowledge of astrophysics that someone doing astrophysics\nmight have, but that\u2019s not the point\nof medicine, especially at undergraduate level. You need to learn\na very large range of things to sufficient detail so that you don\u2019t kill\npeople, and occasionally help some.\nThat\u2019s it. No specialist knowledge\nuntil you graduate.\nThat\u2019s why medicine is difficult,\nit\u2019s the sheer volume of facts you\nneed to know, not the difficulty of\neach individual one. There is no\nabstract mathematical theorem\ninvolving 20 dimensions. There are,\nhowever, about 40 billion pages of\ntextbook to read. Which is partly\nwhy they tend to drink more heavily \u2013 there\u2019s so much more random\ncrud to forget.\nBut also don\u2019t forget that medics are here longer (unless you do\na PhD, or a few masters courses)\nso they might be a bit upset at still\nbeing students...\nIn other words, what I\u2019m trying to\nsay is... friendly rivalry, yes. Angry\nbanter/attacks/slagging off, no. Until\nnext year\u2019s Varsity match anyway.\nMedics vs Imperial vs Medics vs Imperial\nby TRISTAN LANE\nUsing conventional wisdom, and\ngeneral Imperial female experi-ences, it is most generally the male\nparty in an intimate situation that\ntends to avoid the female post-alco-hol-fuelled-rumpus until he is confronted post-avoidance with anger\nand strife. This week, Stormy Woods\nis taking on the role of the very\nsame men she despises so intently.\nI just don\u2019t get it. Which part of\n\u201cwe\u2019ve just gone out for a drink,\nnot as a couple\u201d does he not under-stand? Older men are supposed to\nbe more with it \u2013 more frank, playing fewer games, and respecting\nmore boundaries. Clinginess, weekend DIY and marriage plans are so\nnot where I\u2019m at. I kept to Dr Ruth\u2019s\nadvice \u2013 date different types to see\nwhat works best for you \u2013 and this\nis what I get. Constant calls when\nI\u2019d told him I\u2019d call him when I was\ncomfortable with seeing him again.\nHe only got the hint when I changed\nmy telephone number.\nLet\u2019s talk a little background here\n\u2013 Nick is a 32-year-old Asian entertainment tycoon. He owns a portfolio of properties littered around\nLondon, and drives a Porsche\nBoxster. I met him at a media professionals networking event, for the\nlaunch of Smooth FM. We got on\nwell, he asked me out for dinner, and\nwe somehow ended up at a Lloyds\nbar in London.\nHe\u2019s tall, dark and cute to look\nat, with lightly tousled hair and an\nAustin Reed suit. He\u2019s responsible\nfor providing me with most boring\ndate in history; and having proved\nhimself pompous, insecure and\narrogant, he decided to con himself\nthat I would fall for his materialistic\nsmarm. That\u2019s right, in order to add\ninsult to the injury caused by asking\nwhether I was homosexual on three\nseparate occasions, he dropped the\nbiggest clanger \u2013 he flashed his\ntie at me, and said: \u201cTed Baker\u201d.\nTo make things worse, he jangled\nhis watch and went \u201cHugo Boss\u201d,\nand tugged at his suit lapel, before\nsaying \u201cAustin Reed\u201d. I was visibly\nunimpressed.\nHe continued by telling me about\nhis properties, which he spent the\nweekends doing up. He\u2019d not been\nout in six months \u2013 no gigs, no exhi-bitions, no sightseeing, no evening\nclasses \u2013 shocking. Even more\nastounding was the fact that I didn\u2019t\nget a word in edgeways, having to\nlearn about his customised BMW\nZX3, his trips to Caf\u00e9 de Paris and\nhis issues with my appearance, in\nparticular my hair being tied up!\nHad he not paid for my Western plat-ter, I\u2019d have got up and left. Thank\nGod my best friend \u201cgot dumped\u201d\notherwise I\u2019d have killed myself by\nchoking on an overcooked chicken\nbone. I\u2019m shuddering at the thought\nof him as we speak. Ugh.\nHmph. Nick is not the only guy I\u2019m\navoiding. Somehow, I\u2019ve managed to\nacquire a few unwanted admirers\naround College. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s my inimitable charm, or the\nunrivalled paucity of my irreverent\nbanter; it\u2019s quite easy to beat me\nin the visual department, since I\u2019m\nnot conventionally attractive by any\nstandards.\nI can\u2019t walk into South Kensington\nwithout bumping into someone who\nhas, in previous years, pre-court\ninjunction, followed me home. It\u2019s\ndifficult to turn up in College once a\nyear to pay my tuition fees without\nbeing accosted along the way by\none of the countless spotty, greasy\nexcuses for men who see me as\ntheir dream girl. Sadly, they don\u2019t\nhave the perceptiveness to realise\nthey\u2019re not ideal for me. Since when\nhave holey jumpers been cool? Since\nwhen has wearing the same holey\njumper for weeks on end been cool?\nWhat about bathing, what about\nhygiene, and washing clothes?\nAccents are another point of dis-pute. I hate guys who don\u2019t realise\nthat having an alluring Lancastrian\naccent does not make the content\nof their speech interesting. \u201cI got\ntrollehd whaal my bro woz taykin\u2019\na wazz\u201d. If visually stimulating,\nthey\u2019re good for a quick pull and\nnothing else. Sadly, good-looking\nmen seem to think that\u2019s all they\nneed to keep a woman happy \u2013 personality is just chilli sauce on the\nkebab.\nWhat\u2019s more amazing is that the\nunconventionally attractive Miss\nWoods has got the air-headed piece\nof unbelievable aesthetic pleasure\nbest known as the purple dinosaur\nfinding limp excuses to turn up at\nher door and chat to her flatmates.\nHe feels that roses, badly written\ngothic poetry, childish drawings and\nheart-shaped chocolates are the\nway forward. The way forward to\na psychiatric unit, more like, for\nassuming I\u2019d take to such tacky\ndemonstrations of affection that a\npre-school object of affection would\nhave the good sense to reject!\nI\u2019m surprised most women fall for\nthese things come Valentine\u2019s day\nanyway \u2013 it\u2019s meant to be a day of\ncelebrating your partner and their\nworth, something you could do with\ntheir company alone. Lisa Simpson\nis right: \u201cRomance is dead. It was\nacquired in a hostile takeover by\nHallmark and Disney, homogenized,\nand sold off piece by piece.\u201d\nThe girl about town\nby STORMY WOODS\nA scene from the crowd at last Wednesday\u2019s Varsity match: rivalry?

    "content": "I built Southside\nAfter over 40 years, the Southside halls of residence will finally be demolished this summer.\nPaul Rogers looks back to 1962, when he helped build Imperial\u2019s favourite concrete monolith\nSo, at long last, Southside is coming down. After all this time it has\noutlived its useful purpose and has\nto go. Good riddance say most of you\n\u2013 perhaps a few are nostalgic, but for\nme its demise has a special meaning\nas I actually helped build it.\nFast backward to June 1962. I\u2019d\njust finished my first year, was living\nat home in East London and needed\nsome money. My dad was an iron-monger and spare-time builder so\nI\u2019d learnt a few things and reckoned\na labouring job on a building site\nwas just right. Rumours were rife\nof the cash to be got \u2013 the Victoria\nLine was being excavated and some\nsaid you could make 20 quid a week\n(\u00a3300 in current money and twice\nwhat most casual jobs paid then),\nso I set off for Central London to try\nmy luck.\nIt turned out that the Victoria Line\nwasn\u2019t interested in students, but\nthere were loads of office blocks\ngoing up all over the City, so prospects looked good. Time after time,\nthough, the site foremen said they\nwanted experience, even for labour-ing, and hours of fruitless searching\nleft me thoroughly daunted. By mid-afternoon I thought I\u2019d at least try my\nluck around South Ken. The whole of\nImperial College was like one vast\nbuilding site \u2013 physics and chemical engineering were completed, but\nmost of the engineering buildings\nwere still being worked on.\nSo, too, was Southside. It was up\nto roof height but was a hive of activity with a couple of hundred people\nworking on site. More to the point,\nthe contractors were prepared to\ntake me on, provided I\u2019d work a 60-hour week for \u00a317.50 including site\nbonus. That was more than good\nenough compared with bar work or\nanything else around, so, for that\nsummer, I left home each day at\n6.30am, travelled across London and\nworked from eight until six every\nweekday and eight until four on\nSaturdays.\nThe work involved anything and\neverything \u2013 sometimes totally bor-ing, other times great. Best was\nworking as a labourer for the carpenters doing second fixing in the\npenthouse flats on the top floor.\nGreat views over London, a good\ngang to work with, and the foreman\nso far away in his site office that he\nonly checked up on us a couple of\ntimes a day.\nSome of the other work was soul-destroying. For one week, I spent\nthe entire time chipping away at\nexcess plaster at the base of the\nbedroom walls so that the skirting boards would fit. Several times,\nthrough sheer boredom and care-lessness, the hammer slipped out\nof my hand. Once it went over my\nshoulder and chipped the underneath of the hand basin. If whoever\nis in room 421 looks under the basin\nand spots a chip, that means they\nnever did replace it.\nThe bane of all our lives was\nNorman the foreman, always on\nthe prowl and ready to \u201cstop you a\nquarter\u201d (15 minutes\u2019 wages) for the\nsmallest infringement. Perhaps he\nwas only doing his job, but the one\nsaving grace was that he knocked off\nat noon on Saturday, leaving a handful of workers on site for the last\nfour hours of the week. Work would\nbe set but it is astonishing how fast\nreally well-motivated labourers can\nwork. We\u2019d usually get everything\ndone in a couple of hours, with the\nrest of the afternoon spent sunbathing on the roof or throwing stones\nat the rats that would venture out\nfrom under the floor of the canteen\nhut ten floors below, where Linstead\nHall now stands. Does Linstead\nhave rats? If so, they are probably\n100 generations down the line from\nthose original colonisers.\nAt the end of the summer it was\nback to student life, and Southside\nopened the following year, to much\nacclaim and appreciation (yes, real-ly). I actually got one of the rare\npostgraduate rooms in the place a\ncouple of years later, and greatly\nenjoyed it, perhaps because of the\nadded satisfaction of being just that\nbit possessive about it.\nNow, after 42 years and over 15,000\nstudent residents, it is all coming\ndown, to be replaced by some bit\nof \u2018modern\u2019 architecture that probably won\u2019t last nearly as long. An\nadded irony is that my youngest son\nstarted at Imperial last October and\nis living in Southside as one of the\nlast ever residents!\nSo it really ended up a bit of a\nfamily affair, and, when you watch\nit coming down, spare a thought for\none old Imperial lag, because just\none little bit of my life will be coming\ndown with it.\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 24 February 2005 7\nIt\u2019s time to speak out\n\u201cFirst they came for the commu-nists, and I didn\u2019t speak up because\nI wasn\u2019t a communist.\nThen they came for the Jews, and\nI didn\u2019t speak up because I wasn\u2019t\na Jew.\nThen they came for the trade\nunionists, and I didn\u2019t speak up\nbecause I wasn\u2019t a trade unionist.\nThen they came for me, and there\nwas no one left to speak up for me.\u201d\nMartin Niem\u00f6ller, German pastor\nOn 2 and 3 March, the next stage\nof Babar Ahmad\u2019s extradition\nhearing takes place at Bow Street\nMagistrates Court, near Covent\nGarden. As Babar\u2019s wife said at an\n\u2018End the Occupation of Iraq\u2019 student teach-in held recently at LSE\nand attended by many Imperial stu-dents, the family are \u201choping for the\nbest, but expecting the worst\u201d.\nThis article is a call for everyone\nin Imperial to come with myself,\nour president Mustafa Arif and\nmany others in the official Imperial\nCollege Union delegation which is\nmeeting at 9am in Beit Quad on\nWednesday 2 March to join Babar\u2019s\nfamily and supporters in a demonstration outside the court. This is\nnot just an act of solidarity, but a\nchance, through large numbers, to\ncontinue to put pressure on those in\nthe legal system who will be making\na decision about Babar\u2019s future.\nThis demonstration will be preceded by a showing of the recent\nBBC documentary about Babar\u2019s\ncase, which will be introduced by a\nmember of his family and shown in\nSAF Lecture Theatre 2 at 6pm on\nMonday 28 February.\nAs I have pointed out many times\nbefore, this case is not just about\nBabar, and it is not just about\nMuslims. It is true that Asian peo-ple, immigrants, and ethnic minority groups are being targeted, vic-timised, and used as scapegoats\ninthe current climate of fear surrounding the \u2018war on terror\u2019. Tony\nBlair\u2019s recent pathetic apology to\nthe Guildford Four should highlight\nhow it was previously the Irish who\nwere treated in this way in Britain.\nBut it is also true that restrictions\non rights to demonstrate, the introduction of ID cards and many other\nmoves towards a \u2018police state\u2019 are\nthings that will affect each and every\none of us.\nI had my own very small taste of\nthis clampdown last Tuesday, as I\nended up sitting in a cell for several\nhours in West End Central police sta-tion. I had been arrested for breaching Section 5 of the Public Order\nAct, and, apparently, assaulting a\npolice officer. Neither of these things\nwere true, and as my solicitor later\nconfirmed after I had been released\nwithout charge, I had been arrested for two reasons. Firstly, it was\nthe National Day of Disobedience\nagainst the occupation of Iraq, and I\nwas therefore holding a megaphone\non a demonstration that directly\nchallenged the Government, and\nwhich they therefore wanted to stop\nas soon as possible. Secondly, laws\nare currently being considered to\nban demonstrations (and the use of\nmegaphones) in Parliament Square,\nand an arrest for violent conduct\nwould help that case enormously.\nSitting there, the first thing I\nthought about was Babar Ahmad.\nNow, I am not trying to compare my\nsituation with Babar\u2019s on any level,\nor to complain about my \u2018traumatic\nexperience\u2019. But I did think, if they\nare prepared to do this to a white\nBritish male, imagine what it must\nbe like to be arrested as an ethnic\nminority, or an immigrant, or anyone\nelse who is unfairly victimised and\ntargeted by our state and its police\nforce. And, I thought that sitting for\nthree hours in a cell is not particularly pleasant, even when you know\nyou are soon going to be let out. At\nthe time of writing, Babar has been\nin prison for 4810 hours and faces\nextradition to a country with the\ndeath penalty, for a \u2018crime\u2019 which\nthere is not sufficient evidence to try\nhim for in Britain. Imagine how that\nmust feel.\nI appreciate that many people\nreading this may not have experienced directly the full force of\nwhat we have come to call \u2018justice\u2019. Neither have I. But I would\nencourage anyone who is in principle against what is going on in the\nworld today, to stand up and oppose\nit. Whether it is the anti-war demonstration on March 19, or the demonstration at Bow Street Magistrates\nCourt on March 2, you must speak\nout. Because even if you have never\nmet Babar, or don\u2019t think that any\nof these things have anything to do\nwith you, who will speak out when it\nis your turn?\nCOLIN SMITH\nWELFARE CAMPAIGNS\nOFFICER\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nComing down after 40 years: the Southside halls of residence will be demolished\n\n"
