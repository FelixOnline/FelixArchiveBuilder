    "content": "All' s The Careers Fair had over 6500 visitors\nduring two days this year compared to\n4000 over four days last year. Many of\nthe companies attending stayed for both\ndays. David Ensell, Careers Fair Manager,\nsaid 'Its all gone horribly right'.\nLast year the fair was held in the\nJunior Common Room (JCR). The\ndifferent organisation this year, which\nincluded a marquee on the Queen's lawn,\nhas been a great success according to the\nemployers. Russ Clark, Careers Office\nManager, said that the 'set up is better\nthan the Great Hall or the JCR'.\nComments from the employers included\n'Its better than the JCR' and 'I like the\nmarquee - it looks professional'.\nComplaints included the 'lack' of\nprovision for drink in mid-afternoon and\nthe careers fair handbook, which many\nthought sloppy.\nThough the Fair made \u00a330,000 last\nAll three year engineering degrees at\nImperial College are to be reorganised\ninto four year Masters courses by October\n1992. The Rector, Sir Eric Ash, gave a speech in which he said that the decision\nto change the course structures was taken\nprimarily to 'concentrate above all on the\nfundamentals of science which will\nremain the basis of engineering in the\nfuture'.\nThe decision was also influenced by the\nRector's feeling that an extra year was\nnecessary to match the level of education\nreceived by German engineering students.\nA third factor raised by the Rector was\nthe worry that the level of knowledge\nrequired in A level mathematics courses\nmay be declining. This could be\ncountered, Sir Eric said, by adding more\nmathematics to degree courses. This\nwould require an extra year, especially if\nFree!\nTwo free lectures are to be held in\nPhysics next week. On Wednesday at\n13.15 in Lecture Theatre 1, Dr D. Deutsch\nwill be speaking on 'A Quantum Concept\nof Time'. On Thursday at 12.45 on the\nlevel 3 Physics concourse, the\nMathematical and Physical Society\n(MOPSOC) are having a cheese and wine\nbuffet followed by a lecture by Dr. John\nQuenby. He will speak on the early\nresults from the X ray satellite ROSAT.\nBoth events are open to all members of\nImperial College.\n2\nFair\nyear, the experimental setup has meant\nthat it only broke even this year. It is\nhoped that the improved service will\nmean a larger profit next year.\nDavid Ensell said that the many\ncompanies which had shown satisfaction\nwith the new arrangements would be\nwriting to the Rector, Sir Eric Ash, to\nshow appreciation of this Union organised\nevent. He also stated that any profit\nmade next year could be split between\nthe careers service, currently\nunderfunded by College, and a nominated\ncharity.\nWhen the employers were approached\nconcerning students, who, after all, were\nthe main reason for their visit, comments\nranged from 'there's a good calibre of\npeople here - we often recruit from the\nfair' to the more ambiguous 'Ah, it's not\nworth commenting - the organisers have\nno control on that'.\nthe teaching of calculus were to be\ndropped from the A level syllabus.\nSir Eric said that 'the suggestion that\neducated people need not know calculus'\nwas harking back to a 'two culture'\nsystem which leads to problems in\ncommunication. He commented that the\nlack of scientific knowledge amongst MPs\nwas a problem today.\nWhen questioned after the speech, Sir\nEric said that the Chief Executive of the\nUniversity Funding Council (UFC) had\nbeen involved in the decision and had\ngiven a 'green light'. He added that the\nDepartment of Education and Science\n(DES) is supportive of the move by\nImperial but would not necessarily be\nsupportive of other universities due to the\nincreased cost. Mandatory grants from\nlocal governments will be available for\nthe new four year courses, he said.\nTime's Up\nMr Rob Northey, IC Refectories Manager,\ntendered his resignation last Thursday. He\nsaid that his reason for leaving was\nbecause he had been at IC for five years,\nwhich was the length of his contract.\nMr Angus Fraser, IC Managing Director\nis known to be concerned in the matter,\nbut refused to comment.\nMr Northey said 'I 've enjoyed myself\nvery much', and added that he would go\nto India afterwards. Although he has\nofficially resigned, he will continue to\nwork until January 28th. Thief!\nPolice caught two bicycle thieves last\nWednesday after a member of college\nalerted the Senior Traffic Warden of\nImperial College, Mr Pitrola. Three\nteenagers had been spotted tampering\nwith a bicycle in the old chemistry\nbuilding's bike sheds. Mr Pitrola\nchallenged the youths who ran off\ntowards South Kensington. Two of the\ngang were apprehended by police near\nOld Brompton Road.\nThe youths were found to be in\npossession of bolt cutters, hidden inside\nduff le bags. These bags had a hole in the\nbottom to allow a security chain to be cut\nsecretly.\nMr Geoff Reeves, IC Security chief,\ncommended Mr Pitrola. 'He dealt with the\naffair in a proper manner.' He added that\nthe last 10 days have seen 10 bicycle\nthefts. He said that this was a lot.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr Terry Briley,\nSecurity Officer, reiterated security's plea\nthat bicycle owners should use D locks\nrather than chains. These are available at\ncost price from the security room in\nSherfield.\nHard-up\nStudents may be able to claim over \u00a350 a week 'hardship' payments over the\nsummer vacation from a little known\nGovernment fund. Local Education\nAuthorities (LEA) have the discretion to\naward up to \u00a353.50 to any student whom\nthey consider may suffer undue hardship\nwithout the extra grant. This award\nwould be refunded to the authorities by\nthe Government.\nMr Alan Parker, the Education Officer\nof the Association of Metropolitan\nAuthorities, told Paul Shanley, Union\nPresident, that the LEAs don't get many\nrequests or agree to many. He will be\nmeeting the National Union of Students\n(NUS) next month to discuss the fund. He\nadvises students to write to the LEA in\nwhich they are currently resident to\nregister their intention to claim. A request\nfor a claim form should be sent later.\nOLD CENTRALIANS\ninvite you to a Careers Reception\nfor Graduating Students\n6.00-8.30pm, Thursday 1st Nov\nSenior Common Room, Sherfield\nThis is an ideal opportunity to discuss career\nprospects in most engineering disciplines and\nmanagement, with OCs and their guests.\nWine and light refreshment will be served.\nTickets are free to members and SI for non-members, and should be obtained from the Old\nStudents' Association Office (Room 303,\nSherfield) by Thursday 25th October.\nBEng Dropped\n\n"

    "content": "Rag Tag and Bob Tail FELIX\nTwo events down, lots to go. (Why else\nwould 1 be writing this?) For those people\nwho aren't tired of Rag collecting there's a good old UNICEF/UNA London\nCollection tomorrow, with a free party at\nULU afterwards (ideal if you don't have a big gig ticket). Turn up at today's Rag\nmeeting (Union Lounge 12.40pm) if you\nwant to collect. Also at the meeting we're\ngoing to decide what we should do with\nthe Rag Mags. They're back from the\nprinters and very funny too. So come to\nthe meeting if you have an opinion on\nwhether we should sell them before the\nbeer festival.\nNext Wednesday we have a Rag Raid\nto Guildford, followed on Saturday by the\ninfamous Covent Garden World Wildlife\nFund Collections. So if being a panda for\na day is your cup of hedgehog juice, pop\nalong and see us (yes you've guessed it...)\nthe Rag meeting. The other future events\nare:\nLeukaemia Research pub crawl, Poppy\nDay collection, Rag Week (from Beer\nFestival to Dirty Disco\u2014the new extended\n12 day version). The sponsored Nude\nKamakaze Parachute Jump (24th Nov) is\nnow off the back of Jez, everyone's favourite fire engine. So volunteer to\nstreak from Harrods now. The team\nfinishes with the Canterbury Rag Raid.\nIf anyone else wants to be a cheery rag\nbod then they can stand for 1st year\npublicity officer or Rag Fete coordinator.\nNominations for Rag Mag Editor open the\nweek after Rag Week.\nLove and soapy bananas,\nSteve Farrant, Rag Chairman.\nWell Monopoly went well. Ooops, wrong\narticle, as I was saying Tiddlywinks was\nlots of fun and we managed to hit the\nLWT News and the Sunday Times. The\nevent itself raised around SI,450 for\nActionaid.\nDrink-a pub-dry afterwards failed in its\nobjective, though the Queen's Elm did\ntransform to a semi-arid state by the end\nof the night. A couple of mega interesting\ntid dle related facts for you:\n1. Shan is the first IC President for six\nyears not to go tid d ly winking. Though he\ndid manage a very energetic 'Fuck Off at\nthe Wakey Wakey Southside.\n2. It's the first tid dle in ages not to\nhave a motorised mascot present. (They\nwere all broken unfortunately, however\nClem was excellent at Monopoly and Jez\nwill be available for the Sponsored Nude\nKamakaze Parachute Jump.)\nOne final note, 1 was perfectly fine after\nDrink-a pub-dry but Tanya was so pissed\nshe couldn't even remember half the\nthings she did. Ha Ha Ha.\nSteve Farrant again.\nOpinion:\nPoll Tax, Why Not?\nCecil Parkinson\n^ predicts the fortunes\nof the Conservative\nGovernment\nNational Industries had been a 'Rip-roaring success' and that British Rail\nwould probably be next. Mr Parkinson\nmade the observation that 'nationalism is\nnot suitable for anything that matters'.\nThe Health Service is something that\n'matters' very much. I leave you to draw\nyour own conclusions.\nOn issues closer to home, Mr Parkinson\nsaid that it was his aim in London to\nimprove all forms of transport and then\n'let the people choose how to travel',\nadding that the overcrowded transport\nsystem could take no more passengers at\npresent, although a slight increase on the\nbus system was possible. Speaking on the\ninfrastructure of London he said that\n'planners do not always get it right' and\ncommented 'I look forward to the day\nwhen I can put a bomb under it' in\nreference to Lambeth. (Town or\ncouncillors?)\nSurprisingly the question of Student\nLoans and Education did not rear its ugly\nhead, and neither did the Poll Tax, or the\nposition of the Conservative Party in the\nopinion poles.\nMr Parkinson was most cooperative in\nanswering questions and extended the\nallocated fifteen minutes. He dealt with\nthe only incidence of heckling by saying\n'just an intellectual letting off steam'.\nKaveh Guilanpour.\nIf you went to buy a loaf of bread and\nthe assistant demanded the deeds to your\nhouse, you would think that he were\ncrazy. What is more, you would probably\nwalk out in disgust, and yet this is just\nwhat we accepted for years. Out of a basket of community needs such as food,\nwater, clothing and schooling, some were\npaid for according to use, and others\naccording roughly to the value of your\nhome. Yet no one could say that water\nwas less important than food or schooling\nless important to clothing. So why the\ndifference? Some weak-willed liberal\nmight comment that it was impractical for\nthe state to supply food (as had been\nshow in the Communist Bloc), but this is\nsimply intellectual chit-chat. What we\nneeded was a charge for everything, so\nthat those slacking lefties would really\npay for their spending sprees. The\nCommunity Charge has brought us a new\nfreedom, where everyone has the\nopportunity to pay, almost regardless of\ntheir means.\nBut this new wave of rationalism has\nnot yet reached the shore. As I am sure\nyou all know, half of local finances are\ncontributed by central government. And\namong that, a substantial part is raised\nthrough the so-called progressive tax\nsystem. This no more than a kind of\nfinancial apartheid, where people are\ndiscriminated against by the amount of\nmoney they earn. One group, the nice\nclean people (who just happen to have\nlots of money) are forced to pay more,\nwhile the lazy dirty people (who have a little less) pay less or nothing at all. 1\nhave heard it said, that the well-off\nshould be glad to support the community,\nthat they should pay in growing\nproportion to their earnings. But why\nshould they support a load of w hinge ing paupers? It is well time that we\ndisregarded this socialist nonsense.\nWe need to take a fresh look at this\nproblem. If the Community Charge is\nsuch an equitable solution, we could\napply it more generally. After all, what\ndifference is there between spending on\nthe police (local) and the army (central),\nbetween spending on undergraduate\nstudy (local) and postgraduate study\n(central)? Surely what's sauce for the\ngoose is sauce for the gander. Why stop\nat the Community Charge? Why not a National Charge? Everyone would pay a fixed monthly charge, irrespective of their\nearnings. At last we could put an end to\nthis idea of robbing the rich to give to\nthe poor. We wouldn't need to have any\ntax inspectors, or prosecutions for fraud.\nJust think, that nice man Mr. Piggott\nwould never have gone to gaol.\nYes, this discrimination between rich\nand poor has gone on too long. It is the\nrich who provide employment for the\npoor. And what do they receive in\nreturn? They are charged more for\nservices which they don't ever use. It is\ntime the poor looked after themselves,\nand the rich were left to get on with\ngetting richer. We need a National\nCharge now (I ought to know, I 've got\nloads of money).\nin serious jest...\nMatthew G. Johnson\n\n"

Thought not.\nRipp....Craaaash....\nIn the hands of comic writer and artist\nFrank Miller, the Robo-sequel is not a simple affair, but a combination of at\nleast three separate plotlines. Almost\ninevitably this makes it a much more\ncomplex film than its predecessor.

Once more we have a barbaric apocalyptic society where lots of\nimpoverished looking people scrape out a living from the arid deserts that remain.\nTheir only entertainment is The Game\u2014a sort of public school rugby, but with\nchains, sticks, body armour made from\ntyres and a dog's skull instead of a pig's bladder. Bands of Juggers (players of The\nGame) roam from village to village\nchallenging local teams, and invariably\nwinning. Their prize? Money, food,\nalcohol and women( and men too\u2014\nwomen play on equal terms). The film\ntells of Kidda (Joan Chen) a young Qwik\nin Sallow's team who aspires to the\nLeague. The League is a series of games\nfought between teams from the 7 citi ties, each imaginatively named after a colour.\nEventually the team's wanderings bring\nthem to Red City and a challenge match\nwith a team headed up by an old teammate of Sallow (Rutger Hauer). This chap\nturns out to be called Gonzo, but is\nunfortunately not a blue Muppet.\nThe plot is minimal and the acting\nminimalist ic. The backdrops are standard\n(Australian) wastelands but the extras\nrefreshingly multi-racial. The film will\nnever be accused of selling itself on the\nback of gorgeous people as the Juggers\nare all badly scarred. The\ncinematography is unexciting, and the\nmusic fairly banal. Not really a lot to\nrecommend so far.\nTheir is light in the darkness though.\nThe scenes in the vast underground city\ngive tant a lising glimpses of a feud a list society, with a rich, hedonistic and\naesthetically obsessed hierarchy and an\noppressed and subservient underclass.\nSandwiched between the two are the\nJuggers who form a rather precarious\nmiddle-class.

    "content": "Bird on a Wire REVIEWS\nTo give this film its due, it's scrupulously\nfair. You see Mel Gibson's bum at least as\noften as you see Goldie Hawn's legs. Of\ncourse, both the bum and the legs are\nparticularly fine examples of their type.\nPhysiology make th not the film, alas, so\nwhat does it have to offer in the areas of\nacting, plot and filming? Well, a fair\namount actually. Rick Jarmine (Mr\nGibson) is on the witness protection\nprogramme, changing identity, accent and\noccasionally sexual orientation whenever\nhe is recognised. At present he is working\nin a garage with a southern accent, y 'all.\nThen his college girlfriend-turned-hot-shot-lawyer improbably pulls up for some gas.\nA call to the FBI soon puts the very\npeople he put away on (and some\nbuckshot in) his tail. Thus he and\nMarianne (Ms Hawn) are forced to flee\nacross the country.\nBoth the principals turn in reasonable\nperformances, and Mr Gibson copes well\nin a role that often sends up the macho\ntypes that he is best known for playing.\nThe chemistry is good between the\nprinciples, and the contrast of Rick's retention of his college beliefs and\nMarianne's sell out for yuppie principles is\noccasionally exquisite. The villains rarely\neven make it into two dimensions, but as\ntheir role is low on words and heavy on\nguns it doesn't make that much\ndifference. Admittedly, the cockroach is\nfar more emotionally convincing than the\nmotive less tigers but then I'm sure\ntalented tigers aren't even two a penny in\nHollywood.\nIn amongst all the shooting, flying,\nscreaming (Ms Hawn has a pair of lungs\nto match her legs), roaring, bon king and\nhairdressing something got rather\nunfortunately left out. Where were those\nlaughs? Without them we are left with a comedy-thriller that occasionally raises a wry smile, but would never have you\nrolling in the aisles. Passable, passable.\nPendragon.\nUSSR Bolshoi Symphony\nThe scene was set, the lights in the\nBarbican were dimmed, the orchestra\npoised and as the conductor raised his\nbat to na panting FELIX reviewer\nstaggered to his seat. Despite LRT's attempts to stop me getting to the\nconcert I had made it!\nThe concert opened with Tchaicovsky's Fantasy-Overture Hamlet, Op.67. This\nprovided an exhilarating start to what\nwas to be an impressive concert. It was\ncomposed in 1888 and was obviously\ninspired by Shakespeare's play, and\ndedicated to Grieg, (popularly known for\n'In The Hall Of The Mountain King').\nHowever, Hamlet is a tragedy and I doubt if Tchaicovsky's intention was to\nrecreate the atmosphere of the play since\nhe would have failed miserably if it was.\nThe overture is a bright and inspiring\npiece which even a veh ment' I don't like\nclassical music character', typical of I.C., would recognise parts of, if only from\nadverts. I don't consider myself placed to\ncriticise the orchestra on technical detail,\nbut I did feel that they were a little\nuncertain in their delivery.\nDvorak's Cello Concerto in B minor,\nOp. 104 followed and provided a complete\nchange of atmosphere. The audience\nwarmed to the soloist, Alexander Rudin,\nas he played with a skill and feeling that\ninfected the orchestra and the audience\nwith equal enthusiasm. Rudin played with\nincreasing confidence throughout the\nthree movements. So popular was his\nperformance that he returned to the stage\nto treat us to ten minutes of the most\nimpressive cello I have ever seen.\nAn interval followed and then the\nRomeo and Juliet Suite Op.64, by\nProkofiev began. Its opening can only be\ndescribed as spectacular, and again would\nbe recognised by almost anyone. It was\nonly slightly spoilt by an over enthusiastic\nbrass section. The entire work was\nexcel lant ly done, with the orchestra\nwarming to the audience. The closing\nbars received a standing ovation and such\nwas the reception that Lazarez was\npur sua ded to lead the Bolshoi into two\nencores, including Elgar's Pomp and\nCircumstance, No.l, which was played\nwith great enthusiasm.\nIt was a rare treat to see this orchestra\nin London and they lived up to their\nexcel lant reputation, giving a concert that\nthe audience should not forget for a long\ntime.\nRichard Eyers.\nThe Alternative Motor Show\nFollowing the success of the Science\nMuseum/Lego exhibition earlier this year\nthe Museum is once again displaying\ndesigns based on those infinitely versatile\nplastic bricks.\nThis time students of design across\nEurope were asked to produce a1:5 scale\nmodel of a concept car for the next\ncentury. Their entries, built using only\nLego, range from the wildly original (a giant walking stilt) to the practical (an\negg-shaped passenger vehicle) and the\nshades in between, including the winning\nentry, 'Lobstar', a two-part car comprising\na small electric runaround and an\nenvironment-friendly hydrogen booster.\nAlso on display are computer-controlled\nLego cars and robots that can be\nprogrammed for a variety of movements\nand skills; and for those of us who\nenjoyed being harrassed by small children\nlast time, there is the essential 'build your\nown' section with thousands of the parts\nyou could never find.\nLastly, car freaks will be happy to learn\nthat the Jaguar XJ220 concept car (no,\nnot a Lego one, the real thing) is on show\nfor the next week. The next chance you'll\nhave to see one of these will be one of\nthe 350 they make between '92 and '94.\nThe exhibition is well worth a visit for\nanyone interested in design, cars or\npretty models. Remember, admission to\nthe Museum is free for Imperial students.\nStone.\n\n"

    "content": "Scribblers Corner Imperialist Hypocrisy\nDear Chris,\nThe present Gulf Crisis is not simply a matter of terrorism (see last week) but\nstems from the illegitimate carving up of\nthe Middle East in the 1920s by British\nImperialism. The formation of these new\nstates: Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia et al\nand their artificial boundaries has ensured\ncontinual instability and conflict in the\narea since. Which is what was planned.\nArab Shikh's sympathetic to the British\ncause were made rulers and in most\ncases their families still govern. By separating Kuwait from Iraq it was hoped\nthe little oil rich state would be protected\nfrom the effects of Pan-Arabism\nemanating from Iraq and also weaken the\nlarger state. (Iraq and Kuwait may\nreceive the same income, in $ of oil per\ncapita, but Iraq has many more mouths\nto feed.)\nSince Kuwait's independence in 1961 it\nhas been governed by the same family of\ndictators\u2014the Al Sabahs\u2014installed by the\nBritish. Nepotism is strife and denying the\nmajority of residents the right to vote or\nown land ensures these stooges remain in\npower.\nOut of the two million population of\nKuwait only 800,000 are citizens the rest\nare migrant labourers. Of these 800,000\ncitizens only 60,000 select male citizens\nare eligible to vote in elections for the\nNational Assembly and even this body\nhas been dismantled for the past five\nyears or so. This is the system the US has\nstated it wants Kuwait to revert to after\nthe crisis is solved and not to any form of\nfree or democratic government.\nThe hypocrisy of the present US action\nis contemptible. They have known for a long time what type of tyrant Saddam\nHussein is. They are med and trained his\narmies to the teeth. They aided him in\nhis aggression against Iran, in which\nalmost 1.5 million lives were lost; they\nignored the repression of the Iraqi people\nand the callous treatment of the Kurdish\npeople was overlooked.\nAlso, why is the US not so vehement in\nits condemnation of the Israeli occupation\nof Palestine?\nWhy is there still no end to the\nproblems of Lebanon after more than a decade?\nAnd can't parallels be drawn between\nthe present invasion and the US invasion\nof Panama, last year, when7,000 people\nwere killed and a puppet regime was left\nbehind?\nIt is obvious that the only reason the\nUS led 'Western Alliance' is camped in\nthe desert is to satisfy its greed for oil\nand not for any honourable or righteous\nnotions.\nSaleem Choudhery.\nBookstore Backlash\nDear Chris,\nI fell compelled to write to you in reply\nto the letter headed 'Pricey Publications'\n(Issue 878, 12.10.90).\nThe letter from G Andrade intimates\nthat it is possible to buy all books\ncheaper outside of the Bookstore. This,\nunfortunately for the student, is not true.\nALL book retailers are required to abide\nby the Net Book Agreement. This is an\nagreement that is upheld in the law\ncourts, whereby the publishers dictate the\nselling price of their own books and\nretailers are not allowed to discount\nthem.\nThere are three reasons a book could\npossibly be obtained cheaper elsewhere.\n1. They are breaking the Net Book\nAgreement\u2014something you won't find\nhappening too often as Dillons have just\nbeen prosecuted for it!\n2. The book is 12 months old and\nhence can be sold at 1989 prices. Again\nthis doesn't happen too often as it is risky\nto keep stock holdings of anything other\nthan bestsellers for more than 12 months.\nMost recommended texts are not exactly\nbestsellers.\n3. The cheaper book is an old edition.\nIn which case you're buying a completely\ndifferent book and probably not the one\nyou want.\nGiven the help of your lecturers we can\nstock all the texts that you require. By all\nmeans try elsewhere but do bear in mind\nthat in looking elsewhere you'll probably\nend up spending more on travel than you\nsave on books and you'll certainly spend\nmore time looking.\nAlways pleased to be of service.\nYours,\nNeil McCluskey, Bookstore Manager and\nEx-IC Student.\nP.S. We have cheaper pads, files and\ndocument folders than any high street\nshop including W.H. Smith!!!\nNHS Psycho Sex Change Romp\nDear Sir,\nI am writing about that blok e who,\nafter having a sex change, wanted to\nmarry another blok e. Under British law\nhe was not able to do this, so instead of\ncrawling back under from whichever rock\nhe came, he went squirming and crawling\nto the European Court in order to force\nthe British people to accept something\nthat is against everything this country\nholds dear.\nFor once the Europeans went along\nwith Britain but that still didn't stop the\n12\nrevolting creature. He then said how\nunfair he had been treated and how\neveryone should feel sorry for him. Well\n'Luv' I lost no sleep over it.\nIn the same article it stated that 25,000\nsex changes have been carried out on the\nNHS, which the good and decent people\nof Great Britain pay for. This is totally\nunacceptable!\nThis problem of believing that you are\na women in a man's body is clearly a psychological problem and should be\ntreated as such.\nIf deviants and weirdos want these\noperations they should pay for them out\nof their own pockets. Because where will\nit end?\nIf someone thinks they're Admiral\nNelson will they get an operation to cut\noff an arm and blind them in one eye? Or\nif a person thinks they're the President of\nICU will they get a la bot amy? Yours,\nAlan Bailey, Chem 2.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nKaveh Guilanpour follows the chit-chat of leading Conservative\nfamily man\nRocky Road On walking into the lecture theatre on\nthe ground floor of Mech Eng, I was\nastounded by the lack of security\u2014I merely walked in with my bag (which\ncould have contained anything) and took\na seat\u2014no security guards and no body\nsearches\u2014remarkable considering recent\nterrorist activity in London. Or do the\nIRA have such a high regard for IC\nstudents that they wouldn't harm them.\nAs if to emphasise the lack of security, an\nunattended bag was left in the lecture\ntheatre throughout the address without\nonce being challenged.\nThe next thing of major importance\nthat I noticed is that the Secretary of\nState for Transport is yet another\nConservative MP who drinks Perrier. Not\ncontent to sell our water industry to the\nFrench, are the Government now\nadopting a. policy of buying French\nbottled water as well as French owned\ntap water?\nAnother fact distinguishing him as a true Conservative was his inability to\nremember the name of the Liberal\nDemocrats. This in her ant Conservative\ndisability he shrugged off with a laugh. I do not consider a minister who cannot\nrecall the name of the third largest party\nin the House of Commons a laughing\nmatter, despite the fact that its name\nchanges every five minutes or so.\nMr Parkinson soon launched into the\nexpected oration of how bad a condition\nthe country was in before 1979 and how\nwonderful it is now in comparison,\nthrowing in countless statistics along the\nway.\nA great deal of his speech was devoted\nto the state of the economy, saying that\ndecisions taken after the crash of 1988\nwere a mistake and had led to the high\nbalance of trade deficit and high inflation,\nadding that 'economic lessons had been\nlearned' and that 'the risk of a recession\nhad justified taking the risk of high\ninflation that we have now'. He gave\nanother reason for the present state of\nthe economy as being the 'win the\nelection, pay later' policies adopted by\nthe Government in 1981. He also said\nthat in economics 'motives don't matter\u2014\naction determines results'.\nOn inflation he commented that it\nwould fall but that 'timing was\nunpredictable' and that drops in interest\nrates would follow inflation.\nSpeaking on the recent joining of\nBritain to the Exchange Rate Mechanism\n(ERM), Mr Parkinson said that this 'would\nnot solve Britain's economic problems'\nand 'joining the ERM is no substitute for\nsound economic policy'.\n'Joining the ERM will have benefits but\nwill put pressure on industrial\nproductivity and economic growth'.\nOn being questioned on the timing of\nBritain joining the ERM Mr Parkinson\nstated that the date had not been chosen\nto coincide with the Conservative Party\nconference the following weekend, but\nhad been chosen to 'avoid market\nspeculation'. He revealed that the date for\njoining the ERM had been discussed\nbetween the PM and the Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer, John Major, as early as\nJune.\nIn reply to the suggestion that our\nEuropean Community (EC) partners were\nnot happy with the timing of Britain\njoining the ERM, especially in view of\nhigh interest rates at present, Mr\nParkinson replied that many of the\nGovernment's conditions on joining the\nERM had been met, resulting in the\njoining of the ERM last Mondaysomething that is currently being strongly\ndisputed by Labour in Parliament. Neil\nKinnock claims that the PM had done a'U turn' on conditions previously set by\nthe Government.\nOn Economic and Monetary Union, Mr\nParkinson expressed the attitude of the\nGovernment as 'not obstructive but less\nenthusiastic' than the rest of the EC.\nOn being questioned on Capital\npunishment he replied that he was in\nfavour, but that his view should not be\nofficial Government policy since MPs\nshould have a 'free vote' and should not\nbe forced to vote against their\nconsciences, saying that at the moment\nthere is a 'substantial majority against\ncapital punishment in the House of\nCommons'.\n'Not much' was Mr Parkinson's reply to\nbeing asked about electoral reform and\nproportional representation. He added\nthat Hitler had come to power under a system of PR and that our present system\n'marginal is es extremism'. He went further\nand said that after many years of\nexperimentation with different election\nprocesses, the American political system\nhad come to the conclusion that our 'first\npast the post' system was the best.\nTurning to the issue of privatisation Mr\nParkinson said that past flotations of\n\n"

Here The\nShamen add a racing beat and some rap,\nsucceeding still more in bringing their\nown relevance to today.\nThe album continues with still more\nattacks at apathy and warped morals\nwhere anything is permissible without a divine law to inspire. The Shamen are\npurveyors of sounds and captions more\nthan musicians. They acquire their\nknowledge from the television world of\nfraudulent American preachers and do\nnot find it necessary to add with vocals to\nwhat has already been said. Nonetheless,\n5 H4mE TI The\nMothers\nEven if we Lose\nThis four track EP is a blues/folk\ncollection of songs, which sound very\nAmerican\u2014similar to the likes of REM,\nbut not as melodic. They favour story\ntelling, with a key theme of lon lines s, delivered with a distinctive rasping vocal\nstyle.\nThe EP kicks off with Even if we Lose.\nThis is the most blues orientated track,\nwith scarcer vocals than the others.\nShame on You is an acoustic number\naccompanied by a piano, and dealing\nwith the subject of prostitution. A married\nman picks up a prostitute and takes her\nhome, as his wife is away. His bedside\nmanner leaves a lot to be desired as he\ntells her 'Everybody's lonely, so lie on top\nof me!!!'.\nOn the other side\u2014Trying to Find a Reason is a bit more up-tempo,\nreminiscent of early Echo and the\nBunnymen (of all things). It is a more\npoppy combination of guitar and vocals.\nFinally The Marriage is Gone is a slow\nnumber which is full of the despair,\nregret, self-pity, and lon lines s of a man\nclose to the brink. The singer is a father\nwriting to his son about the end of his\nmarriage, and his resulting lon lines s. Although not the type of music we\nwould choose to listen to, it's not bad, but\nwe can't really relate to the subject\nmatter.\nPinky& Perky. Loud\nThis doesn't explode, although it does\nmanage a pretty loud pop. All three\nnumbers suffer from a case of production,\nleaving them too clean to be exciting,\nwhile giving a definitely trans- Atlantic\ntaste, that probably lines the title up as\nMTV fodder. The singer tries too hard to\nbe interesting, and even succeeds a bit.\nAn acoustic track helps to get the\nneedle to the middle of the record, but\nnot much else. Perhaps this is the New\nModel Army influence still lingering on\nsinger, Craig MacLaughlin.\nThe other two tracks are different\nenough to take Loud off the beaten track,\nbut only onto the grass verge. If they\nwant to be good beyond doing what\neveryone else is doing, they will have to\nbe wie r der than this. Their music's own merits are not enough.\nEntact LP\nwhere they do sing, it is only to confirm\nthis trip py dream world which counters all\nthat is real.\nThe hit, Omega Amigo is also included,\nbut seems a little insignificant against\nsuch a relay of sounds as here. However,\nthe familiarity does provide a little relief\nfrom the head-on onslaught at the mind\nall around it. This effect is secured where\nthe flick is an image of the first, a restatement of what has preceded. More\nconformist is the dance track, Hyper Real,\nwhich should be a single, overlaid with a female soul voice. There is an addition of\nAfrican influence and a little rap, again\nconfirming that The Shamen are just as\nconcerned with race as religious zeal. A contrast to this is the half-consciousness\nof Oxygen Restriction where the whole\nfloats on the edge of the surreal.\nThe album is sealed with the last track,\nHear Me, almost a repetition of the first\ntrack. There is no apathy within the\nrealms of the innocuous black pit of\nvinyl. You can either fight it or be swept\ninto it, it cannot be ignored.\nSJH\nExplosive 12\"\nQuite a lot of people will like this quite\na lot.\nMungo WHERE'S THE\nCARTER\nREVIEW???\n\n"
