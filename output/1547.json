It\u2019s really\nQuinto who always has the tougher\njob of having to juggle a wide range of\ncon\ufb02icting emotions. Vulnerable, ro-botic, sensitive, idealistic, he embodies all these things, and Quinto is no\ndoubt an invaluable addition.\nBecause Into Darkness has bigger\nthings on its mind, trying to deliver\non the most impressive action scenes\nHitting the screens almost exactly\none year after its showing at the\n2012 Cannes Film Festival, \u201cMud\u201d\n(McConaughey) is a wanted fugitive\nwho puts far too much on the line\nin the name of love. Hiding out on a\ndeserted island, he longs to be reunited with the love of his life Juniper\n(Witherspoon), although this ambitious plan of his is put in jeopardy\nas he is constantly hunted by shady\ncharacters who are clearly acting\nabove the law.\nBut despite the title, the focus of\nthe \ufb01lm isn\u2019t entirely on Mud\u2019s plans:\ndirector Je\ufb00 Nichols tells the story in\nthe point of view of two young, naive\nboys (Sheridan, Lo\ufb02and) who like an\nadventure: and they\u2019re certainly in\nfor the most unforgettable event of\ntheir lives.\nEllis (Sheridan) and Neckbone (Lo\ufb02and) are best of friends who regularly go on river excursions riding\naround in their boat and bike. One\nday they stumble upon and befriend a\nmysterious man who has a lot to hide\nand needs protection.\nDealing with things that are far beyond their maturity level, the boys are\ninitially hesitant about helping this\nshadowy \ufb01gure, but knowing that it\u2019s\ntrue love that gives Mud his drive,\nit\u2019s Ellis who gets more stuck in, with\nhis innocent views on how love, relationships and marriage work, whilst\na sweet love life of his own seems\nto develop. Things at home are also\nrocky, further shattering his already\nfragile ideas on love. His parents are\nthrowing around the much-dreaded\nD word, and this potential separation\nalso hits him hard.\nSet in parts of America you probably never knew existed, its rich,\nwarm visuals embrace the long line\nof complex characters who are far\nmore than they appear to be. Just\nwhat is Mud running from? Why are\nState Troopers hunting him down?\nIs Juniper really the beautiful sweetheart Mud thinks she is? Is what they\nshare true love? Confusing for the au-dience, so imagine how ba\ufb04ing this\nmust be for the kids in the middle of\nthis.\nThe adult cast is excellent (McConaughey\u2019s been piling on one fascinating performance after another\nover the recent years - after Magic\nMike and Killer Joe, he is once again\non \ufb01ne form), but the real winning\nperformances here are those of the\nchild actors.\nSheridan, in his second \ufb01lm after\nMalick\u2019s Tree of Life, shines displaying natural stoic bravery, and Lo\ufb02and\nis equally brilliant in his screen de-but.\nIt\u2019s not as powerful or touching as\nNichols\u2019 previous directorial outing,\nthe hauntingly beautiful Take Shelter, but here is a layered and rewarding coming-of-age story, somewhat\nwith a similar feel to Stand By Me,\nmade even more so thanks to Lofland\u2019s striking resemblance to the\nyoung River Phoenix.\nit can possibly manage, you do see\ncertain characters becoming more\nside-lined for the sake of making\nroom and freeing up the screen time.\nBut everyone, ranging from Saldana,\nJohn Cho, Pegg, Anton Yelchin, Urban and Eve, is given their chance to\nstand out, and their own unique personality quirks to play around with.\nWhat sets this apart from the original is however, the perfect casting\nof a solid villian. Britain\u2019s very own\nSherlock, Cumberbatch, takes on the\nrole of John Harrison, someone who\nsingle-handedly declares war on the\ngood guys. His one-man army is not\nto be laughed at given both the skills\nand rage he possesses. He is one capable of causing some serious dam-age, and Cumberbatch, with his tall\nframe, cold, still looks and sinister\ndelivery of his dialogue, has no trouble passing as the one person who\ncould possibly destroy all. His character is not all about him wanting to\ndestroy the world for no reason what-soever, he does have more to add to\nenrich the plot, with Cumberbatch\nshowing a wider spectrum of personalities that bring out his initially villainous character.\nIt\u2019s a predictably loud and action-packed a\ufb00air, but one with intelligence and focus in telling a coherent\nstory. What starts o\ufb00 as a straightforward \u201cgood guy goes hunting\nfor the psychotic bad guy\u201d becomes\na lot wordier (and this is a good\nthing) with back stories and double-crossings that is kept up by the \ufb01lm\u2019s\nhealthy pace and many bursts of colourful sci-\ufb01 action.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFRIDAY 17 MAY\nDeciding what to do with \u2018the rest\nof your life\u2019 after graduation can be\na daunting prospect. If you feel you\nhave become pigeon-holed with too\nfew opportunities available to you, or\nthat you are capable of doing anything\nbut don\u2019t know how to choose which\nroad to take, then this article is for you\nWhat follows should give you some\nperspective and suggest some simple\nsteps towards getting a job after grad-uation, moving on to further studies\nor even doing something completely\ndi\ufb00erent.\nSince leaving Imperial College London with an MEng (Hons) and then\na PhD in Aeronautical Engineering, I\nhave worked as a self-employed English teacher in Spain, as an occasional\npianist and joined the Future Leaders\nDevelopment Programme at Barclays\nin 2012 \u2013 see www.seemore-bemore.\ncom. Although being an undergraduate and then a postgraduate feels like\nquite a long time ago now, I remember worrying about what I would do in\nthe future. Sometimes it felt as though\nthere were so many possibilities that I\ndidn\u2019t know which to choose, while on\nother occasions it felt as though there\nwere very few roles for which I would\nbe suited.\nIn my opinion, the key for making\ncareer choices is simple: identify the\nskills you enjoy using, the strengths\nyou have and \ufb01nd the \ufb01elds that corre-spond. Never forget that a high salary\nwill not necessarily make you happy\nand that you are capable of choosing a\ndi\ufb00erent path to your friends.\nWhen studying, it can be hard to\nremember that your skill set is just as\nimportant as your academic results.\nYou may \ufb01nd that the set of skills you\nwill use in a full-time job are very different from those you used at univer-sity: the prerequisites for academic\nsuccess can be very di\ufb00erent to the\nprerequisites for success in business.\nI adore my job, but doing it as well\nas I can is not a question of being the\nsmartest person in the room or always\nknowing how to solve a problem on\nmy own. It is a matter of knowing who\ncan solve it, what support they will\nneed to do it and how to get that support for them.\nOnce upon a time I was an academic\nstudent doing Aeronautical Engineering, yet these days the most di\ufb03cult\nmathematics I need on a daily basis\nis addition and the only time I think\nabout aeroplanes is when I check in at\nan airport. On the other hand, I now\nuse interpersonal skills that I never\nlearned in a lecture theatre, such as\nbuilding up a professional network,\nknowing the skills of each person I\nyou know and developing the skills\nto manage people. These di\ufb00erent\nskills sets mean that it is important\nthat you try to balance your studies with extra-curricular activities if\nthat is where your strengths lie. Now\nI know that captaining a sports team,\nhelping to organise a large university\nevent or running a society would have\ndeveloped skills far more valuable to\nmy current employer than a hundred\nmodules on helicopter dynamics.\nFor those of you graduating next\nyear, set aside a little time over the\nsummer and next year thinking about\nyour next steps. Don\u2019t hesitate too\nlong to decide what jobs to apply for,\nas sometimes you will learn more\nabout what you want to do during the\napplication process. If you \ufb01nd yourself lacking motivation to complete\nan application form or disliking the\npeople you meet from the business,\nit could be a sign that this path is not\nfor you.\nHere are some suggestions to help\nyou get started:\n1. Identify the skills that you enjoy\nusing and where your abilities lie. Are\nyou fascinated by solving theoretical problems or do you prefer \ufb01xing\nbroken go-karts? Is analysing and refuting written arguments your thing\nor are you much happier ad-libbing\nyour points on a stage in front of an\naudience? If you need some help, ask\nyour friends and family for the things\nthat you do well. Be as clear as you\ncan about the skills you have and the\nareas you want to develop. Don\u2019t sell\nyourself short or focus only on your\nuniversity studies: playing in a football\nteam regularly requires teamwork and\ndedication, while organising university events requires leadership and the\nability to prevent or solve last-minute\nproblems. Employers value these\nskills, so let them know that you have\nthem.\n2. Make use of the Careers Advisory\nService, the internet and any friends\nwho are already working to help you\nmap out which jobs use the skills you\nhave identi\ufb01ed. Be clear on the skills\nyou want to use; sometimes it can also\nhelp to be clear about the things that\nyou don\u2019t want to do. Use any work\nexperience you have, from bar work to\nsummer internships, to feed into this.\n3. Meet the people who work at the\ncompanies and in the sectors that you\nwant to work in. Go to the Careers\nFair at Imperial (or elsewhere) and\nspeak to the people manning the stall.\nAsk yourself, \u2018Is that the kind of person I would like to become\u2019? Look for\n\u2018meet and greet\u2019 events for students,\nnetworking evenings or industry\nbody events. Spending an hour or two\nspeaking with people who have been\nworking in your chosen industry for\nyears, hearing what they enjoy and\nwhat they complain about too, can be\na real eye-opener.\n4. Apply as early in the academic\nyear as you can, even if you are not\n100% certain about your choices. The\nlonger you leave it, the harder it is to\nget onto the most popular graduate\nprogrammes or \ufb01nd the best direct-entry jobs. Speak to any friends you\nhave who are already working \u2013 some\ncompanies even o\ufb00er a reward to employees who recommend a friend who\nis o\ufb00ered and accepts the job.\nTry and spend as much time as you\nreasonably can on this. It is your \ufb01nal\nyear and you will be busy but, if you\nre\ufb02ect on your skills and career choice\nto choose carefully and early, you will\nreap the rewards. Remember too that\nif in a few years\u2019 time you decide that\nyou want to do something else (within\nreason), you should be able to do that\nfairly easily. The career choices that\nyou make now are not \ufb01nal \u2013 right\nnow, you only have to make the best\nchoices with the information available\nto you.\nIf you would like to read more about\nmy Barclays experience and those of\nother graduates, please visit www.\nseemore-bemore.com.

In other words \u201clet\u2019s just kick this\ncan into the distance, and then write a\nreport that will be long and boring and\nhopefully nobody will read\u201d. Of course\nyou couldn\u2019t have a two week investigation and find everything there is to\nknow, but it definitely feels like the PR\nmachine is in overdrive here. Sorry to\nbe cynical. If they were serious, they\ncould just walk up to the researchers\nnow and give all involved in animal\ntesting a pop quiz. If they don\u2019t know\ndetails they should, well, then there is\ncause for concern.\nThey will interview people, who will\nprobably be like Rebekah Brooks at\nLeveson and just say that they remember no specific details of any\nspecific events. In the groups that\ncarry out this research it\u2019s likely that\nit would be obvious who told on you\nif you get found out to have behaved\ninappropriately (sorry to go all school\nplayground on you). Therefore it is\nlikely that those bystanders will not\nreally want to then have to spend another however many years in an office\nwith someone they just got in to trou-ble. It sounds weird to put it like that,\nbut I fear that may happen with this\ninvestigation.\nAt the heart of this is really just what\nhappens to many people in many jobs:\nyou get callous and blas\u00e9 about what\nyou are doing and how it affects people and the environment around you.\nPeople in positions of responsibility cannot let such things happen to\nthem, especially when you are caring\nfor others and animals. A good example is the LIBOR fixing. People got\ncomfortable and probably didn\u2019t even\nthink of the consequences. That\u2019s obviously horrible, but it\u2019s also human.\nIt\u2019s amazing how people can behave\nwhen they are in a group. People will\ndo things that they probably wouldn\u2019t\nif they had time to think about it.\nI think what this really exposes is,\nin fact, that scientists are just human and are not infinitely amazing at\ntheir jobs. Those companies claiming\nthat their the height of \u201cprofessionalism and excellence\u201d. Guess what.\nThey\u2019re going to have people that\nscrew things up all the time. Imperial\nand everyone else likes to think of a\nscientist as infallible. If you\u2019re a first\nyear, then a PhD student seems like\nsome kind of fountain of knowledge.\nThe weird thing is that they are just\nlike you. They are just like everyone.\nJust the same way as an accountant\nmay not know something about an\narea of accountancy, a PhD student\nmay not know the proper way to do\na reflux if they study computational\nchemistry (can you tell I did chemis-try?). And a PhD may not even know\neverything about their project as well.\nThink about it like a doctor. Does your\nmedic friend know their medicine\nback to front? Why would they magically know everything there is to know\njust because there is a \u201cDr\u201d in front of\ntheir name? The point I\u2019m struggling\nto make is simple: people are not per-fect, people do not even know their\nown jobs perfectly, this is fine if you\nare not responsible for lives; however,\nif you are in a position of responsibil-ity, you have to make sure that you at\nleast know the relevant bits of your\njob. If you don\u2019t, leave it to someone\nelse who does.\nImperial snooping on you\nThis is pretty hilarious. The idea of\npeople in College reading memes is\nodd.

This is so not the case here.\nThe Great Gatsby is everything the\ntrailer promises, and more. It is bold,\nbrash, glamorous and over-the-top in\nthe trademark Baz Luhrmann way.\nLuhrmann\u2019s collaboration with JayZ for the soundtrack and visuals were\ncriticised no end, but has turned out to\nbe a great move \u2013 in fact, they are the\nbest aspects of the \ufb01lm. The whole ex-perience, despite not having the original brilliance of Luhrmann\u2019s Romeo +\nJuliet, is mesmerising: the narration of\nthe \ufb01lm is done via music videos, which\nis utterly cool. The iconic images from\nthe book, such as the green light at the\nend of the dock, East Egg vs. West Egg\nand the haunting eyes of T.J. Eckleburg\nare eerily similar to how one would imagine them having read the story. All\nthat said, the experience in 3D is a little bit dizzy-making, with its \ufb02ashing\nlights and fast-panning footage.\nLuhrmann\u2019s old favourite Leonardo\nDiCaprio takes the title role, and does a\nThe Great Gatsby\nDirector: Baz Luhrmann\nScreenwriters: Baz Luhrmann, Craig\nPearce, F. Scott Fitzgerald\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio,\nTobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel\nEdgerton\nThe not-bad-you-should-probably-see-it Gatsby\nfairly good job \u2013 although not perhaps\nup to the standards of his recent portrayal of evil Calvin Candie in Django\nUnchained. Unfortunately for DiCaprio, it\u2019s a tough task for anyone to live\nup to the complex and di\ufb03cult tycoon\nthat Fitzgerald created. Fortunately\nfor DiCaprio, however, Luhrmann\ngives Gatsby what might possibly be\nthe most \ufb02ashy and \ufb02amboyant introduction ever, which sets the scene so\nbeautifully for DiCaprio\u2019s slightly egotistical type of acting. Although Robert Redford\u2019s original Gatsby might\nhave been slightly stronger, DiCaprio\u2019s\nGatsby has a much better setting. His\narrogant, ostentatious, slightly aggressive Gatsby is, underneath, more nervous and insecure than expected, which\ngives a real depth to the character and\nshows o\ufb00 DiCaprio\u2019s skills. His excitement and stress around Daisy is very\nobvious, and it\u2019s incredibly obvious\nwhen he\u2019s lying \u2013 almost the opposite\nof Redford\u2019s coolness and indi\ufb00erence.\nDaisy Buchanan herself, played by\nthe wonderful and beautiful Carey\nMulligan (who suits 1920\u2019s style like no\nother), is made into a far more heartrending character than the Daisy in the\nnovel by Luhrmann. Despite almost\nconstant narration (by Tobey Maguire\u2019s character, Nick \u2013 big mistake:\nMaguire\u2019s voice is hugely irritating\nafter a while), a favourite line \u2013 \u201cHer\nvoice was full of money\u201d \u2013 is left out.\nMind you, it would have been inappropriate in this adaptation. Here her\nvoice is only full of sadness and disil-lusionment. Although it\u2019s reassuring to\nsee the human side of Daisy, it is also a\nshame to see her shallow, feckless side\ntoned down here.\nFor the full e\ufb00ect, I\u2019d recommend\nseeing this one in the cinema. The\nsound and the sparkles alone deserve\nthe big screen experience. Completely\nridiculous, totally too much, wonderfully garish \u2013 this certainly isn\u2019t one to\nmiss.\nSenior Star Wars\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\nIt\u2019s bad enough that there\u2019s going to\nbe another Star Wars \ufb01lm. It\u2019s even\nworse that it\u2019s going to be made by\nDisney. Worse still are the hints that\nsome of the original cast will be returning to reprise their roles.\nRumours are \ufb02ying around Hollywood that Carrie Fisher, Mark\nHamill and Harrison Ford will be\nstepping back into their (pretty old)\nshoes as Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo respectively.\nThis is all very nice and nostalgic but\nthe average ago of the trio is now 62,\nand thoughts of them \ufb01ghting anything are a little far-fetched.\nHaving said that, none of the three\nroles have been con\ufb01rmed by produc-ers. However, Hamill has revealed\nthat he has had a number of meetings\nwith both the \ufb01lm\u2019s creative consultant George Lucas and it\u2019s executive\nproducer Kathleen Kennedy. In a recent interview, Hamill didn\u2019t go quite\nso far as to con\ufb01rm his involvement\nin the movie, but did drop several\nrather heavy hints that Carrie Fisher,\nat least, is on board.\n\u201cPart of me is cautious,\u201d Hamill\nconfesses, \u201cSaying \u2018let everyone keep\ntheir nice memories if they have nice\nmemories and don\u2019t try to go back\nand do it again.\u2019 But the other side of\nme, the adventurous side, thinks, \u2018if\neveryone\u2019s in, how could I miss this?\u2019\u201d\nHamill also spoke about his concern that the new \ufb01lm will rely too\nheavily on CGI, which he hopes will\nnot be the case.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with CGI,\u201d\nhe explains, \u201cBut I think you have to\nhave a balance because the camera\nperceives the width and the depth\nand the weight of a miniature or a\nmodel.\u201d\nIt seems, however, that Hamill is\nreassured that the \ufb01lm will be a success by the presence of Michael Arndt\n(award-winning writer of Little Miss\nSunshine) as the movie\u2019s scriptwriter.\n\u201cIt always starts with the script,\u201d\nenthuses Hamill, \u201cand that\u2019s why I\u2019m\nso encouraged by Michael Arndt\u2019s involvement because I respect his writing so much. He\u2019s a big fan of these\nmovies, so hopefully we can make\nsomething that doesn\u2019t make everyone want to \ufb01nd us, cut o\ufb00 our heads\nand throw it right in our faces.\u201d\nStar Wars: Episode VII is expected\nto arrive in UK cinemas in 2015.\nTop 15 Films in UK Cinemas\n1.

A yearly zones 1&2 student\nBen Fernando takes a trip to the new hall\u2019s location to investigate\nNorth Acton: How bad is it really?\ntravel card comes in at an a\ufb00ordable\n\u00a3848, or roughly 20% of my maintenance loan.\nOkay, so what about safety \u2013 is the\nnickname \u2018Crackton\u2019 really warrant-ed? Well, er\u2026 possibly. Apart from\nhaving almost twice the amount of\nviolent crime as a proportion of total crime that South Kensington has,\nthere seem to be a few issues with antisocial behaviour and cannabis farm-ing. News headlines on the town\u2019s\nwebsite inform us that:\n\u2022 Dispersal zones have been estab-lished; police warn, \u2018you may be removed to your home\u2019\n\u2022 \u201915 year old boy stabbed\u2019\n\u2022 \u2018Man injured after stabbing\u2019\n\u2022 \u2018Three men jailed for armed robbery\u2019\nAnd, just in case you were wonder-ing, Ealing had a \u2018record number of\nrubbish complaints\u2019 in 2012 \u2013 55,407.\nSo assuming the intrepid freshers\novercome their fears of violent crime\nand lots of rubbish, can they expect a\ngood student experience?\n\u2018Not really\u2019, says a University of the\nArts London student living in the\ntower block adjacent to the station.\nShe tells me that there\u2019s not really\nmuch to do apart from taking the bus\ninto Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Oh, and she\nsometimes goes to the local ASDA,\nwhich just so happens to be the same\nASDA where the three men were recently jailed for breaking , entering\nand assaulting a security guard and\nthreatening to kill him. But don\u2019t wor-ry, the local corner shop has installed\n\u2018anti-burglar fog\u2019, whatever that is.\nWell, perhaps other students who\nalready live there have di\ufb00erent views\nabout Acton? Or not. \u2018There\u2019s not\nmuch to do\u2019, complains Amit Rungkwansirirog, an international student\nat UAL, \u2018it\u2019s inconvenient\u2019. I caught her\nin her pyjamas as she wandered over\nto the local shop for some milk, as she\nexpressed annoyance that the nearest\nA\nbig shops were four tube stops away.\nWest\ufb01eld seems to have become these\nstudents\u2019 saving grace, providing the\nonly entertainment and nightlife in\nthe area. It\u2019s a convenient 45 minutes\naway by night bus.\nOn the plus side, there seem to be\na number of gambling establishments\nfor the betting type. In addition to the\nconvenience store, closed co\ufb00ee shop\nand bank there was a Ladbrokes\u2019 and\na William Hill just a few hundred feet\nfrom the main entrance to the existing\naccommodation. Clearly the students\nhave found new uses for their time\nand money.\nDetermined to \ufb01nd something exciting to do, I pressed on. First on\nthe attraction list is Gypsy Corner,\nwhere the six-lane remnant of the\nM40 careens down a hill. For tra\ufb03c\nlight a\ufb01cionados, the area is de\ufb01nitely\nwell worth a visit, but perhaps not for\ncyclists. Facing a six mile journey to\nCollege, it\u2019s only a matter of time until a student joins the ranks of cyclists\nkilled over the last few years on the\nA40.\nI prefer trains to cars, so I travelled\non the train line. Acton students will\nhave a prime location for watching\nthe high-speed services out of Euston, and, as I was glad to discover, in\nwatching the planes come into Heathrow. Needless to say I got quite a kick\nfrom seeing not one, but two A380s\ncoming in to land! You could almost\nsay it was the highlight of the entire\ntrip.\nSo, it really does seem as if Acton is\nwhat it\u2019s made out to be: a commuter\nsuburb with few local amenities or at-traction, and a serious issue with antisocial behaviour. It might be okay if\nyou\u2019re middle aged and own a car, but\nwill seven hundred non street-smart\nfreshers who are living away from\nhome for the \ufb01rst time in North Acton have a good experience? I think\nnot.\nAll photos: Ben Fernando\n\n"

This taboo needs to be tackled, as the mismatch between the number of people\nneeding a transplant, and those willing to donate their organs, is vast.\nMore than 10,000 people in the UK\nare currently in need of a transplant,\nand of these, 1000 die needlessly each\nyear whilst on the waiting list. That\u2019s\nthree people a day dying because they\ndo not receive an organ in time.\nI\u2019m sure most of you are aware of\nthe theory behind organ transplanta-tion, however taking a moment to run\nthrough the basic procedure involved\nseems sensible. Organ transplantation\nis required when a person loses function of one or more of their organs. A\nreplacement organ may be required\nin order to maintain a good quality of\nlife, or even in order for them to stay\nalive. They could potentially receive\nRebekah Judge tries to convince you to become an organ donor\nFace your mortality\nan organ transplant in one of two\nways. A healthy person may choose to\ndonate a non-vital organ (for instance,\na kidney) to a friend, a member of\ntheir family or even a stranger. Alternatively, they could receive an organ\nfrom someone who has chosen to donate their organs in the event of their\ndeath. In this case, the donor\u2019s organs\nare allocated to people on the organ\ntransplant list; a national register of\npeople needing an organ transplant.\nOrgan transplantation has the potential to save and transform the lives\nof individuals and their families, a\nnumber of whom have su\ufb00ered for\nmany years with a poor quality of life.\nUnfortunately, due to the shortage\nof organ donors, the full potential of\norgan donation to change lives is not\nbeing ful\ufb01lled. Whilst almost all of us\nwould take an organ if we needed one,\nonly 30% of us are registered organ\ndonors.\nAs students at a renowned scienti\ufb01c\ninstitution, we are being equipped\nwith skills which have the potential to\nimprove the lives of people around the\nworld.

Think about\norgan donation, consider signing up,\nand become part of a lifesaving move-ment. Because you never know, you\nyourself may one day rely on the organ\nof a total stranger.\nThis article is on behalf of The Organ Donor Drive by Imperial Hub.

Inside an art gallery next\nto Hoxton Overground, the walls were\ndecked out with hundreds of di\ufb00erent\nsimple, yet creative t-shirts, making the\nnight look more like someone\u2019s Tumblr\nfeedthanaclub.PorticoQuartet,Stub-born Heart, Factory Floor, Anushka,\nEaux and CKTRL had teamed up for a\nnight of artful beats and groove.\nThis was my \ufb01rst Boiler Room session\nso I was unsure of what to expect. With\nPortico Quartet requiring a large area to\nset up the crowd were con\ufb01ned to a ring\naround the gallery which I found rather\nstrange. It made the atmosphere feel\nrather muted although you got so close\nto the acts that you couldn\u2019t help feel the\nrhythms.\nPortico Quartet were the main draw\nFresh from playing the Alexandra\nPalace with Everything Everything\nand Two Door Cinema Club the trio\nChvrches came to the Village Underground with the weight of expectation lying squarely on their shoulders.\nThey recently won best new non-US\nband at SXSW and made it into the\ntop 5 of the BBC\u2019s sound of 2013. Little surprise then that the gig sold out\nin minutes and the queues to get in\nstarted an hour before doors opened\nThrough the delicate vocals of Lauren Mayberry and pulsing synths of\nMartin Doherty and Iain Cook, Chvrches have found a winning formula.\nCritics have drawn comparisons between them and the Canadian duo\nPurity Ring, but live the ominous bass\nsounds more like an epic blend with\ntheir fellow Glaswegians Mogwai.\nThey opened with their debut release \u2018Lies\u2019, a hypnotic electropop tune\nwhich set the mood for the rest of the\ngig. With trippy laser beams and lots\nof \ufb02ashy lights they slowly built up\nto the climax of the evening, performances of their most commercially\nsuccessful tracks \u2018Mother we Share\u2019\nand \u2018Recover\u2019. On the way though Chvrches showed they aren\u2019t just a one\ntrick pony, with Doherty taking the\nmic to perform the intimate \u2018Now is\nnot the Time\u2019. There can be no doubting the true star of the evening, the elf-ine Lauren Mayberry. Her immaculate\ndelivery and presence really captured\nthe hearts of the audience, as did her\nplayful banter on themes as diverse as\nGame of Thrones (their cover of the\ntheme went viral on YouTube), kittens\nwith laser pointers and boy bands in\nthe audience. Add to that her ability\nas an intriguing lyricist and Chvrches\nhave found a new indie heart-throb.\nTo round o\ufb00 the evening Mayberry\nperformed (as promised) a karaoke\nversion of Little Kim\u2019s \u2018Lady Marmalade\u2019 rap followed by a stunning cover\nof Prince\u2019s \u2018I would die 4 U\u2019, a song\nwhich could have been written for\nthis band. So did Chvrches live up to\nthe hype? Although they aren\u2019t quite\nthe \ufb01nished article yet a fantastic gig\nshowcased their massive potential and\nleft the audience hungry for more.\nThomas Leeman Writer\nBoilerRoomMakeSession008\nMark Engand Music Editor\nof the night for me although Stubborn\nHeart pleasantly surprised me. Their\nsynth pop washed over me and it had\na real futuristic edge, showing their real\npotential. A real let down, however, was\nthe Factory Floor DJ set. I have been to\na few of their live shows and the deaf-ening, thunderous racket which they\nconcoct is so alive and so vital that I\nwas expecting great things. The DJ set\nhowever, felt too contrived, and lacked\nurgency. It didn\u2019t help that most of the\ncrowdintheroomweretalkingamongst\nthemselves, or was that because of the\nset? Chicken and egg I suppose. CKTRL\nprovided some swagger to the evening.\nA singer joined for the beginning of the\nset and her honey tones mixed well with\nthe slow, sparse beats.\nPortico Quartet smashed the evening\napart with their rendition of \u2018Window\nSeat\u2019 really hitting the spot. They rounded o\ufb00 the night with \ufb02air their niche mix\nof ambient electro jazz. They are fresh,\nforward thinking and absorbing.\nFor more information on boiler room\nsets visit www.boilerroom.tv/live\nI went along to the \ufb01nal of the Uni\nMusic League last week having heard\nonly one song by James and the Rabbit Hole. I didn\u2019t know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.\nThe band only formed early this year\n(following an application to the com-petition) and since then their main\nfocus has been writing enough songs\nto play in the rounds of the competition as they sailed through them one\nafter another. The Uni Music League is\nthe biggest student music competition\nwith a big prize (an EP recording deal\nwith Metropolis Studios, a slot at Wilderness Festival, places as a support\nact at KOKO, a PR campaign and pro\nphoto shoots) and so the band worked\nhard. By the \ufb01nal they had six of their\nown songs (having written the most\nrecent song two days beforehand) and\nhad accumulated a very appreciative\ncrowd. They started the set with a cover of Daft Punk \u2018Get Lucky\u2019, a current\nsure-\ufb01re hit. They really did the song\njustice and sent the crowd wild from\njust a few notes in. It was easy to understand why the crowd was so excited\nabout the band.\nThe lead singer, James Burrows, is\nan incredibly capable vocalist with a\nvery enjoyable twang to his voice that\nreminded me a little of Jason Mraz.\nDuring the set, he was often accompanied by harmonies from guitarist Tim\nPlummer. Each musician in James and\nthe Rabbit Hole has obvious talent and\nthis was showcased in brilliant solos\nfrom each of them over several of the\nsongs. The drummer, Dan Day, switch-DowntheRabbit-hole\nJulia Spindel Writer es between a huge variety of drum\nrhythms with ridiculous ease and the\nkeys player, Francis Clegg, treated the\ncrowd to some brilliant jazz-style solos\non the top half of the keyboard, leaving them wanting much more. James\nand the Rabbit Hole\u2019s music marries\nseveral genres from rock to soul and\nyet is far from over-complicated, taking us back to classic old-school funk\nthat many bands shy away from these\ndays, but is simply enjoyable as ever.\nThe varying textures within the songs\nwere skilled, as were the transitions\nbetween the songs. Several songs were\nstopped dead perfectly, with quick\nmovement into the next song, much\nto the listeners\u2019 delight. Others were\ninterlaced with amusing stage chat.\nThroughout the set the band were\nconstantly interacting with each other\nto keep in perfect sync and at the right\nlevels, but also just through enjoyment of playing the music. And the\nenjoyment was infectious. At several\npoints James took to jumping across\nthe stage with his colourful guitar and\ngrey desert boots, shaking his black\nhair, showing the level of energy that\nthis kind of music is all about. At one\npoint the drummer acquired a straw\nhat and was drumming on his feet.\nI\u2019m not sure what the hat was for but\nit contributed to a very inclusive and\namusing set from the band.\nUnfortunately James and the Rabbit\nHole didn\u2019t win the Uni Music League\ncompetition, but this is far from the\nlast we\u2019ll be hearing of the band. They\nalready have a dedicated following and\nare planning more gigs and record-ings. I can\u2019t wait for the next perfor-mance.\nSkye Portman Photography\n\n"

The auction was pulled during\nthe evening of the same day.\nThe internship was organised privately by the Department, and had not been\nauthorized or associated with Imperial\nCollege as a whole. Felix contacted Imperial College London for a statement.\nA College spokeswoman said: \u201cWork\nexperience placements at Imperial are\nconsidered locally within the College\u2019s\ndepartments. A member of sta\ufb00 had\nagreed with Westminster School to\nhost two work experience placements\nfor A Level students at the Institute\nof Biomedical Engineering, each lasting a week. One placement was to be\nauctioned, with the proceeds to go towards supporting Westminster School\u2019s\nbursary programme and capital building projects. The other place was to be\nreserved for a pupil from one of Westminster\u2019s state school partners.\u201d\nThe fundraising auction, which includes other items, is raising money for\nuse of \u201cexpanding Bursary Programme\nas well as cover the expense of the new\nfacilities [that the school has recently\nbuilt]\u201d\n. Other internships on o\ufb00er include a week long placement at Barbara Weiss Architects and Crossbridge\nCapital, an investment fund, however\ninternships are not the only type of lot\nup for purchase.\nThere was no indication that bidding\non the items is only available to members of Westminster School, and their\nfamilies, however criticism has been\nlevied at the College for opening its\ndoors to people based on their ability\nto pay. The Imperial College Widening Participation statement itself states\n\u201cThe College aims to identify and attract students of the highest academic\nability and potential, and would not\nwant \ufb01nancial considerations to deter\nsuitable applicants.\u201d\nFelix spoke to Paul Beaumont, Union\nPresident, who informed the paper that\n\u201c[he has] emailed the College Secretary\nand Comms team this morning to inform them of it.\u201d He continued, \u201cI pointed out to the comms team the coverage this already has in national papers\n(Westminster speci\ufb01cally, not Imperial)\nand asked if they can do something to\nstop Imperial\u2019s association with it. I personally think that this goes completely\nagainst the idea that students (on an internship or otherwise!) get in on their\nacademic merit, not how much they\ncan a\ufb00ord to pay.\u201d\nFollowing the removal of the lot, Imperial College published a statement\nnoting \u201cOn re\ufb02ection the Institute of\nBiomedical Engineering has requested\nthat the auction place be withdrawn\nand is considering the best and fairest\napproach to hosting work experience\nplacements in the future.\u201d\nThe Union have also released a statement saying: \u201cThe Sabbatical team asks\nthe College to still provide and advertise the opportunity to any school pu-pil, with an attached bursary from the\ndepartment su\ufb03cient so that any pupil\ncan access the opportunity regardless of\ntheir means.\nFurthertothis,apaperwillbebrought\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nto Imperial College Union Council on\n30 May discussing how these opportunities are sourced and advertised to Alevel pupils and what constitutes work\nexperience and an internship for A-level pupils. This will hopefully mandate\nthe sabbaticals to further investigate\nthis issue ensuring that such a situation where opportunities are provided\nto students from only an educationally\nadvantaged background never happens\nagain.\u201d\nIt has also emerged that Westminster\nSchool was contacted by the Bar Standards Board over the auction of a one to\ntwo week mini-pupillage with a criminal defence barrister in London. The\nauction site says that the winner will be\nable to gain an insight into the world\nof a criminal defence barrister.

    "content": "SPORT\n31\nFRIDAY 17 MAY\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAfter what was quite a comfortable\nwin the previous week, we were full\nof con\ufb01dence as we travelled to Sussex. The opposition won the toss and\nelected to bat \ufb01rst on a wicket that offered plenty of assistance to the seam-ers early on. The Sussex captains decision to bat \ufb01rst was seeming like the\nwrong one when Simon Mitchell had\none of their openers caught behind in\nthe second over, more tight bowling\nfrom Simon and our captain Jayanth\nGanapathy saw the pressure mount\non the Sussex batsman and Jayanth\ntook advantage of this, \ufb02attening the\nSussex number 3\u2019s o\ufb00 stump in emphatic style. Some wayward bowling\nfrom \ufb01rst change bowler Jack McCurley relieved the opposition of\nthe pressure that was applied by the\nopening bowlers. As soon as spin was\nintroduced it seemed as though the\npressure was back on the opposition\nas left-arm spinner Darshan Patel\nbowled his \ufb01rst two overs for just one\nrun and controversially bowled their\nother opener. Sadly this was as good\nas it got for Patel as he continually\nconceded extras throughout his spell\nand although he ended with \ufb01gures\nof seven overs 1-23, 14 of those runs\nwere gifted to the batting side in sun-dries. From the other end, Vignesh\nVenkateswaran was unplayable (10-4-17-2) and if it wasn\u2019t for a few edges\nhis 10 overs would have gone for even\nless than they did. Despite this and\nsome tidy bowling at the death by Jayanth (10-3-21-2) and Simon (9-1-30-1), extras \ufb02owed freely throughout\nthe innings as well as seven dropped\ncatches and Sussex closed their innings on 183-6, which was really 50\nmore than they should\u2019ve gotten.\nIn reply, Anmol Bedi and Y. Varma got us o\ufb00 to a good start and it\nseemed as though we would reach the\ntarget with overs to spare. In the \ufb01fth\nover out of nowhere the pitch started\nto do things that we didn\u2019t see at all in\nthe previous innings. Some very penetrative bowling and excellent \ufb01elding saw Sussex take wickets at regular\nintervals. Joe O\u2019Gorman o\ufb00ered some\nresistance against their strong bowling attack and top scored with 18, this\nwas unfortunately not enough and we\nwere 64 all out in 25 overs. A disappointing performance; in a game that\non another day, we could have won\nquite comfortably; led to a 119 run\nloss with the di\ufb00erence between the\ntwo sides being solely down to a lack\nof discipline on our part bowling 33\nextras and dropping seven catches.\nEveryone agrees that there is much\nto be improved upon before the next\ngame and I hope to bring you better\nnews in the future. Watch this space!\nSports Writer\nDarshan Patel\nIC 2nd XI\u2019s second game of the sea-son, and their \ufb01rst in BUCS, was\nagainst Kings Medics 1st XI, a team\nwho had won their 2 games this sea-son. However, a strong display by IC\nled to a comfortable 50-run victory.\nStand-in skipper Will Baker got\no\ufb00 to a good start by assembling\neveryone at Putney Bridge station\non time, before making the journey\nto Berrylands. With some glorious\nsunshine, and a \ufb02at pitch, IC made a\nstrong start batting \ufb01rst. Chris Gayle\nLomas Persad cracked a few unstoppable cover drives in typical Carribean fashion before being adjudged\nlbw on 28. Fellow opener Rohin Patel\nhad a careful start before blazing his\nway to a match-winning 114. After\nsuccessive boundaries, one of the\nopposition \ufb01elders remarked, \u201cYou\ncan\u2019t do anything about that, it\u2019s just\ngood batting.\u201d He was in a hurry to\nget to somewhere after the game,\nand hopefully he got there. There\nwas also good support from the middle order, with Hemant Morjaria\u2019s 11\nof 44 balls applauded by the skipper\nand dubbed as \u201cthe Samaraweera to\nRohin\u2019s Sangakkara\u201d. Good contributions from Jai Patel, Will Baker,\nJohan Rekers, Cameron Currin and\nUmar Minhas led to an imposing total of 286.\nWith morale high, IC set about\ntrying to get quick wickets, however\nthe opening pair started well with\na 130-run partnership. After Will\nBaker slipped and bowled a delivery\nover 2nd Slip\u2019s head, the game was\nslipping away. However Lomas, who\nhad bowled well without much luck,\n\ufb01nally knocked leg stump over. With\na tight 10-over spell from debutant\nPriyank Shah with 2 wickets and run\nout, IC were right back in the game.\nOne of the more comical catches\nhappened when Shah dropped an absolute dolly of his own bowling, but\nthe ball popped straight into Cameron Currin\u2019s hands at short extra\ncover. With electric \ufb01elding and tight\nbowling by Chris Hong from one\nend, spinner Vignesh Venkataraman\nhad the opposition all-at-sea with a\nbrilliant spell of 5 overs, conceding 8\nruns and picking up 4 wickets, with\nsome brilliant keeping from Jai Patel.\nFurther wickets from Umar Minhas\nand Johan Rekers completed the in-nings. The opposition were visibly\nshaken, writing \u2018Yosn\u2019 instead of \u2018Johan\u2019 in the scorebook. The umpires\nwere also ba\ufb04ed about some strange\nnoises being heard on the \ufb01eld. This\nhad no relation to where Hemant\nMorjaria was \ufb01elding, obviously.\nTwo catches from the skipper were\nenough to seal the victory in the rapidly fading light giving IC a handsome victory and maintaining their\nnow 2 match unbeaten run!\nOn Wednesday the 24th April, the\nBUCS Outdoor Cricket season began.\nWe had our \ufb01rst game at our home\nground Harlington against the University of Reading. Reading arrived late\nso the game was reduced to 46 overs\nper innings. Reading won the toss and\nchose to bat \ufb01rst.\nJayanth Ganapathy and Shazad Ahmad opened up and kept it tight at the\nstart. We got a breakthrough early on\nand we were on top. Their next partnership was a good one and it seemed\nlike we were going to chase a large total\nif we did not get a breakthrough. Shazil Choukath, our 1st change medium\npacer, was brought into the attack and\ncaused a few problems initially with\nhis pace but soon enough, the batsmen started enjoying the extra pace\non a slow pitch. The spinners, Darshan\nPatel and Joe O\u2019Gorman, were brought\nin and immediately troubled both the\nset batsmen. It only took a few overs\nfor the spinners to strike dismissing\nthe pair.\nMore wickets fell and with the help\nof some tight bowling at the end of the\ninnings we restricted Reading to 173-9\no\ufb00 46 overs. Jayanth \ufb01nished with excellent \ufb01gures of 4 for 22 o\ufb00 10 overs,\nDarshan with 2 for 20 o\ufb00 9 overs,\nShazad with 1 for 24 o\ufb00 9 overs and\nJoe 2 for 36 o\ufb00 9 overs. Imperial went\nin to bat after Tea needing 174 from 46\nat around 3.8 runs per over.\nAnmol Bedi and Vishal Nair opened\nup and were tested by Reading\u2019s opening bowlers. Anmol was dismissed\nearly and I, Juhin Patel, went in.\nVishal and I played ourselves in and\nsoon started opening up. We shared\na strong 100 run partnership at a\nhealthy run rate. However, in the same\nover I was run out for 37, Vishal was\nstumped on 57. Another wicket fell in\nthat over and a collapse was possible.\nIn came two new batsmen, Jayanth\nand Joe. They both played sensibly and\nkept the scoreboard ticking by working the ball around. Eventually, we successfully chased down the target with\n10 overs left to play. Jayanth \ufb01nished\non 43 not out and Joe on 24 not out. It\nwas a strong performance overall and\nwe are now con\ufb01dent going into the\nnext game.\nSportsWriter\nJuhin Patel\nPriyank Shah Sports Writer\nFelix Sport gets the lowdown on cricket\u2019s continued success\n2nd XI cruise to 50 run win\n1st XI chase well\nSummer (and cricket) is here!\n\n"

It was a stunning morning, the perfect set up for\na full day ahead of racing and sunning ourselves on the grass. Eighteen\npeople worked together in the Tetris\nchallenge of squeeze themselves, their\nbags and racing bikes into two minibuses but with everything \ufb01nally on\nboard we set o\ufb00 down the M4 on open\nroads, treated to faint snoring noises\nfrom the back seats.\nNew club captain Si\u00e2n Morgan began the long eventful day in a whirlwind stress. So in the spirit of club\ncamaraderie the entire front row of\nthe bus decided to wind her up some\nmore. It is far too easy to do, especially with Marcel \u201ctrouble-maker\u201d\nAdmiraal leading the assault. But once\nwe\u2019d made it to Calne time was too\nshort to get worried about what was\nhappening later that day; we had to get\ninto racing gear. TriIC\u2019s \ufb01rst competi-tor, Hugh Sparks, had 20min to regis-ter, set up transition, warm up, change\nfor the swim and get to the race brief-ing. Despite this unprecedented rush,\nhe clocked in a strong \ufb01nish, coming\n243rd/412, starting us o\ufb00 well with\na good opening swim of 14:31. Si\u00e2n\nMorgan, Ed Hallett and Richard Flint\nwere up next, entering a busy pool.\nSi\u00e2n dominated with a substantially\nfaster swim than the others, but errors\nin the pool were soon made up by Ed\non the bike.\nWith the sun beating down, it was\neasy to get into racing mood. Getting\nout on the bike leg was beautiful and\nbrought back a lot of cycle passion for\neveryone after a dreadful winter of\nspin classes and turbo training. Marcel Admiraal disappointed an eager\ncrowd by not achieving his self-pre-dicted 25min for 25Km on the bike,\nbut \ufb01nished well for a \ufb01rst triathlon.\nOut of 18 people, 13 had never done\none before, so a superb e\ufb00ort.\nScrew-Up Of The Day has to go to\nMike Kaye who 30min before his race\nwhile wheeling his bike to transition,\nmanaged to not only blow an inner\ntube but shred his front tyre completely in the process. The de\ufb01nitive image\nof a beaten man, with glasses down,\nhe wobbled his bike back to a sympathetic home crowd and disappeared\nfor a stress relief \u201cman run\u201d to ease the\npain. As soon as Si\u00e2n heard about the\nshocker after her race, she marched\nstraight to the marshals o\ufb03ce in all\nher sweaty glory to see what could be\ndone. God knows how, but she managed to negotiate Mike another time\nslot in 15 minutes.\nSi\u00e2n was now back into panic mode.\nBy this point Mike had run a full 10k\nand wasn\u2019t totally sure where he was.\nWith all hands on deck, the Mike Kaye\nSupport Crew organised necessary\ntransition prep and race numbers, as\nwell as setting up Ed\u2019s bike for him to\nborrow. Back from the run, Mike practically jogged straight into the pool\nto start his race. The fun wasn\u2019t over\nhowever, as coming out of the pool, he\nhad no idea where the bike was. A daisy chain of Imperial triathletes shouted directions until he found it and was\nsoon on and out of sight with a shining\ngrin on his face. When he crossed the\n\ufb01nish line an hour later Mike returned\nto a hero\u2019s welcome.\nThe race included a 750m pool\nswim, 25k bike and a 5k run (actu-ally 5.65K measured by Garmin). The\nswim was hectic, with thirty people in\nthe pool in each heat. The organisers\ntried to slot you in with people of a\nsimilar swim time, but it was no use.\nFor some, a lot of time was lost in letting people over take at pool ends as\nrequired in the race rules. Open water\nswims will always be a better measure\nof your swim capability. Transition\nwas easy and well organised, but a long\nrun out with the bike made it a long\ntransition time. The bike was on open\nroads, no closures, but it was less of an\nissue than expected. No tra\ufb03c lights,\nwhich was a huge relief, but there were\na few junctions to stop at if there was\ntra\ufb03c. A nice bike led into a \ufb02at out\nand back run and a water stop at the\nturn around point which was very well\nreceived. Shame it was a signi\ufb01cant\ndistance longer than the quoted 5k.\nThe team performed superbly:\nBUCS Sprint is the highest calibre\nevent in our calendar, and this year\nwas no exception, with a huge GB\nteam turn out. Top TriIC \ufb01nishers\nwere Jean-Claude Besse coming 21st\noverall, beating many GB competitors\nwhich is an incredible achievement\nand Aimee Di Marco \ufb01nishing 23rd in\nthe women\u2019s category.\nOther notable \ufb01nishers are Tom\nPearson who, despite never doing a\ntriathlon before, and never racing on\nhis new bike, clocked the 68th fastest\nbike time, beating well seasoned tri-athletes at their own game, and Hendrik Frentrup clocking 98th fastest\nbike leg.\nThe rest of the day was food, sun,\nsupporting our competitors, and in\nthe case of Liz Crow, fraternising with\nthe enemy. But we soon \ufb01gured out\nshe was actually dating the guy from\nCambridge Triathletes and wasn\u2019t just\nTriIC sprint to the finish\nEd Hallet Sports Writer\nTemperatures rise at BUCS Sprint Triathlon\na massive \ufb02irt. Si\u00e2n\u2019s home baked muf\ufb01ns went down a treat as we watched\nthe \ufb01nal racers \ufb02y by, having waited all\nday for their chance to clock a time. It\u2019s\nde\ufb01nitely better to race early, how else\ncan you justify gorging on a picnic of\ncarbs and protein.\nWe had a great insight into the\nworldly knowledge of our members,\nincluding an idea to cycle the Danube\nRiver, which Annabelle Meyers loved\nas she\u2019s \u201calways wanted to cycle India\u201d\u2026\nBefore we went home we ducked in\nfor a quick pub stop to look at photos,\nresults and play a game of pool watching the sun go down. Race lethargy\nsoon set in. BUCS Olympic distance is\nour next big race, with an open water\nswim it will allow the club to put its\nnew wetsuits to good use, and maybe\nwe can rack up some more stunning\n\ufb01nishes. This is likely to be the last\nrace report for the year, so a massive\nthank you must be made to the TriIC\ncommittee: Hendrik Frentrup, Sarah\nLewis, Harriet Nerva and most importantly Si\u00e2n Morgan for stepping up\nas chairman for the summer term and\nrocking the show! I may even say the\nclub is stronger with the rearrangement so thanks guys. We have had an\namazing year, growing exponentially\nand racing like mad.\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFRIDAY 17 MAY\nhttp://indianapublicmedia.org/\nHipster mice display neurological individuality\nndividuality seems to be more\nof an adolescent dilemma for\npicking pro\ufb01le pictures than\nit may be for neuroscientists,\nbut research this week shows\nthat they too are worrying just how to\nstand out from the crowd. Donning\ntheir lab coats and grabbing their microscopes rather than a mirror and an\niPhone, researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California may have pinpointed the reasoning for what makes us all that little bit\ndi\ufb00erent.\nThe study, centred on groups of genetically identical mice, identi\ufb01ed how\nneurological di\ufb00erences may contribute to individuality in tandem with environmental in\ufb02uences. When kept in\nthe same complex enclosure for three\nmonths, it was seen that the brains of\nthe mice altered di\ufb00erently in regards\nto what they did.\nThis alteration is referred to as\n\u201cbrain plasticity,\u201d and is, broadly\nspeaking, the mechanism behind how\nlong term memories derived from\nwhat is experienced are stored via the\nhippocampus.\nPlasticity is the alteration of neu-ronal connections within the brain,\nwith certain connections becoming more stable between the groups\nof neurons involved in \u201cstoring\u201d the\nmemory. It is this physiological change\nthat allows for certain memories to\nbe recalled much more easily in the\nfuture, and the researchers are now\nsuggesting that neuronal di\ufb00erences\nin the genetically identical mice may\nbe contributing to their \u201cindividuality.\u201d The term individuality here was\nconsidered to cover any di\ufb00erences in\nbehaviour, problem solving, patterns\nof exploration or even idiosyncrasies\nseen between the groups of genetically\nidentical mice.\nThe mice, whilst exploring their en-closure, were tagged with transponders and had antennae attached to track\ntheir movements. After the three\nmonths, the mice were then surgically\nassessed to determine plasticity di\ufb00erence by counting proliferating precursor cells within their hippocampus.\nWith previous studies showing that\nthese cells are crucial to neurogenesis-the production of new neurons \u2013 and\nincrease through physical and cognitive activity, it was found that mice\nthat had di\ufb00erent exploratory behaviour had di\ufb00erent numbers of neurons\nbeing generated, and thus, introduced\nelements of individuality into the\ngroups of mice.\nAlthough this seems very much self-explanatory to the general free-think-ing scientist (of course experience is\ngoing to de\ufb01ne individuality, isn\u2019t that\nobvious), this is the \ufb01rst case of being\nable to quantify just how plasticity can\nbe altered by measurable interactions.\nIt is the \ufb01rst direct link between behaviour and plasticity, but should not\nbe considered as entirely indicative of\nenvironmental in\ufb02uences alone contributing to who we are.\nDespite these mice being genetically similar, their behaviour was not\nidentical at the beginning of the study,\nhinting at some variation that may occur at a much earlier developmental\nstage. Such di\ufb00erences were merely\nampli\ufb01ed by the interactive complex\nthey were placed in and the next step\nis to pinpoint just what might cause\nthese di\ufb00erences at a more precise\nlevel.\nFor now though, this study hints at\nwhy even identical twins brought up\nin the same household, surrounded\nby the same people, may be two completely di\ufb00erent people personality-wise.\nSo, teenagers of the world, want to\nconvey just how individual you are?\nPut down the phone, wipe o\ufb00 the\neyeliner and step outside; a picture\nmay be worth a thousand words but\nexperience seems to be worth more\nneuronal plasticity than we are yet to\nquantify.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1235294\nRead online at felixonline.\nco.uk\nPhilippa Skett on how mice are linking experience to what makes\nus who we are\nI\nSummer Finance Job\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0002\u0005\u0007\b \u0003 \u0006\u0003 \b \u000e\b \u000f\b\u0003\b\u0006\u0007\u0010\u0011\u0012\u0013 \u0013\u0014\u0015\b\u0010\u0013\u0016 \u0003\u0012\u0015\b\u0003 \u0015 \u0012\u0014\b\n\u0005 \u0014\u0013\u0005\u0013\u0002\u000f\b \u000f\u0006\u0003\u0006 \u000f\u0006 \u0010\u0003 \b \u0003\u0012\u0004\b \u0016\u0003\u0006\u0011\u0007\u0016\u0003\u0006 \u0010\u0003 \b \u0016\u0007\u0006\u0011\u0013\u0004\u000f\b \u0006\u0013\b\n\u0012\u0017\u0007\u000f\u0006\u0016\u0007\u0012\u0006\b \u0016\u0003\u0012\u0003\u0014\u0007\u0016\u0007\u0012\u0006\u0018\b \u0019\u0013\u0002\u0012\u0004\u0007\u0004\b \u0012\b \u001a\u001b\u001c\u001b\b \u001d\u0015\b \u0006\u001e\u0013\b \u001f !\n\"\u0018\u001f\u0018#\u0011\u0003\u001e\b \u000e\u0013\u0005\u0006$\u0013 \u0013\b %\u0003\u0012\u0003\u0014\u0007\u0005\u000f&\b \u001e\u0007\b \u0003 \u0016\b \u0006\u0013\b \u0010\u0013\u0016\u001d \u0012\u0007\b \u0014\u0005\u0007\u0003\u0006\b\n\u0007\u0013 \u0007\b\u0003\u0012\u0004\b\u0006\u0007\u0010\u0011\u0012\u0013 \u0013\u0014\u0015\b \u0012\b\u0003\b$\u0005 \u0007\u0012\u0004 \u0015&\b\u0007\u0012\u0007\u0005\u0014\u0007\u0006 \u0010\b\u0003\u0012\u0004\b\u0010\u0005\u0007\u0003\u0006 \u0017\u0007\b\n\u0007\u0012\u0017 \u0005\u0013\u0012\u0016\u0007\u0012\u0006\u0018\n'\u0011 \u000f\b\u000f\u0002\u0016\u0016\u0007\u0005\b\u001e\u0007\b\u0011\u0003\u0017\u0007\b\u0013 \u0007\u0012 \u0012\u0014\u000f\b$\u0013\u0005\b$\u0013\u0002\u0005\b\u0010\u0013\u0005 \u0013\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0007\b\u0003\u0010\u0006 \u0013\u0012\b\n\u0003\u0012\u0003 \u0015\u000f\u0006\u000f\b \u001e\u0011\u0013\b \u001e \b \u0005\u0007\u000f\u0007\u0003\u0005\u0010\u0011\b \u0003\u0012\u0004\b \u0003\u0012\u0003 \u0015\u000f\u0007\b \u0013\u0012\u0014\u0013 \u0012\u0014\b \u0003\u0012\u0004\b\n\u0011 \u000f\u0006\u0013\u0005 \u0010\b\u0010\u0013\u0005 \u0013\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0007\b\u0007\u0017\u0007\u0012\u0006\u000f\b\u0006\u0013\b\u0003 \u0004\b\u0013\u0002\u0005\b\u0003\u0012\u0003 \u0015\u000f \u000f\u0018\b(\u0007\b\u001e \b\u0006\u0005\u0003 \u0012\b\n\u0015\u0013\u0002\b \u0012\b \u0002\u0012\u0004\u0007\u0005\u000f\u0006\u0003\u0012\u0004 \u0012\u0014\b \u0004 \u0017 \u0004\u0007\u0012\u0004\u000f&\b \u000f\u0006\u0013\u0010)\b \u0004 \u0017 \u0004\u0007\u0012\u0004\u000f&\b \u000f\u0006\u0013\u0010)\b\n\u000f \u0006\u000f&\b \u000f \u0012\u0013$$\u000f&\b \u0004 \u0017\u0007\u000f\u0006 \u0006\u0002\u0005\u0007\u000f&\b \u0016\u0007\u0005\u0014\u0007\u0005\u000f&\b \u0005 \u0014\u0011\u0006\u000f\b \u0003\u0012\u0004\b \u0013\u0006\u0011\u0007\u0005\b\n\u0010\u0013\u0005 \u0013\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0007\b\u0003\u0010\u0006 \u0013\u0012\u000f&\b\u0003 \u0013\u0012\u0014\b\u001e \u0006\u0011\b\u0011 \u000f\u0006\u0013\u0005 \u0010\u0003 \b\u000f\u0007\u0010\u0002\u0005 \u0006\u0015\b\u0003\u0012\u0003 \u0015\u000f \u000f\u0018\n\u0003\u0012\u0004 \u0004\u0003\u0006\u0007\u000f\b\u0016\u0002\u000f\u0006\b\u001d\u0007\b\u0012\u0002\u0016\u0007\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0007&\b\u001d\u0002\u0006\b\u0012\u0013\b$ \u0012\u0003\u0012\u0010 \u0003 \b\u0007 \u0007\u0005 \u0007\u0012\u0010\u0007\b\n\u000f\b \u0005\u0007*\u0002 \u0005\u0007\u0004\u0018\b +\u0006\b \u000f\b \u0004\u0007\u0003 \b \u0007 \u0007\u0005 \u0007\u0012\u0010\u0007\b $\u0013\u0005\b \u0007\u0012\u0006\u0007\u0005 \u0012\u0014\b \u0006\u0011\u0007\b \u0011\u0007\u0004\u0014\u0007\b\n$\u0002\u0012\u0004\b \u0012\u0004\u0002\u000f\u0006\u0005\u0015\u0018\b \u0013\u0016 \u0007\u0006 \u0006 \u0017\u0007\b\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0007\u000f\u0018\b \u0006\u0015\b\u001d\u0003\u000f\u0007\u0004\u0018\n\u000e \u0007\u0003\u000f\u0007\b\u0007\u0016\u0003 ,\b\u0005\u0007\u0010\u0005\u0002 \u0006\u0016\u0007\u0012\u0006-*\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0002\u0005\u0007\u0010\u0003 \u0006\u0003 \u0018\u0010\u0013\u0016\n\"\u0007\u0003\u0004 \u0012\u0007\b$\u0013\u0005\b\u0003 \u0010\u0003\u0006 \u0013\u0012\u000f\b.\u0002\u0012\u0007\b\u001c/\u0006\u0011\b\u001a\u001b\u001c0\n\n"

College have stressed\nmultiple times that Professor Brown\nis \u201cindependent\u201d. The BUAV however\ncontest this, saying: \u201ca well-known and\nstrong supporter of animal research,\nheading the Medical Research Council\n(MRC) unit which manipulates mice to\npredispose them to develop all manner\nof diseases, but the MRC actually funds\nanimal research at the Imperial College.\nThis is hardly an independent inquiry.\u201d\nMichelle Thew, Chief Executive of the\nBUAV said, \u201cThe public are likely to\nsee Imperial\u2019s inquiry into the animal\nsuffering and poor practices uncovered\n(C) BUAV\nby our investigation as a whitewash.\nThis investigation raises significant and\nfar reaching questions about animal research in the UK.

In recognition\nof her services to Physics\nshe was appointed Commander of\nthe British Empire (CBE) in the New\nYear Honours and earlier this month\nshe was elected a Fellow of the Royal\nSociety (FRS).\nShe is also the first female Head\nof Physics at Imperial in a still predominantly male department; incredibly there are nine times more\nmale academics than female. Despite\na hectic schedule, she found time to\nchat about her career and route to\nthe top.\nStephanie Walton: Have you always wanted to be a Physicist?\nProfessor Joanna Haigh: After my\nundergraduate degree I wanted to\nretrain as a medic but I could not afford it. Instead I studied for a MSc\nin Meteorology at Imperial and enjoyed it so much I became hooked.\nImperial was different in the 70s; I\ngot thrown out of the Union Bar\nsince only men were allowed. Imperial is a lot more friendly these days.\nSW: Was your doctorate plain sailing or were there moments of exasperation over malfunctioning\nexperiments?\nJH: Of course there were moments\nof exasperation. I had a computer\nmodel which kept crashing and it\ntook me weeks to work out why.\nSW: Was it hard researching whilst\nraising three small children?\nJH: It took some organising, but the\ndepartment was very supportive. My\nresearch profile suffered a bit of a\ndip though.\nSW: What do you do as Head of\nDepartment?\nJH: It is quite demanding. I deal with\nour research excellence framework,\npromotions, faculty management is-sues, health and safety, fellowships\u2026\nIt is fun though and I am very proud\nand honoured to have been chosen\nto do it.\nSW: Tell me about your CBE. Do\nyou know who nominated you?\nJH: I have no idea. I was informed\nby letter and it came as a complete\nsurprise. I went to Windsor Castle to\ncollect the award. It was a lovely occasion and the Queen asked me very\nsensible questions. She was very impressive for a lady of her age.\nSW: I lost count trying to enumerate papers you have published. Do\nyou remember writing all of them\nand do any stand out in particular?\nJH: I know some better than others.\nA couple have been pleasingly influential for example the paper I published in 1996 on solar radiation and\nits effect on the stratosphere. Some\nof the things we said were picked up\non and have been developed into a\nwhole new area of interest.\nSW: You are a climate model ex-pert. How do these models work?\nJH: You\u2019ve got me on my favourite\ntopic! They are amazing! Basically\nyou write down four equations, solve\nthem on a discrete grid and integrate\nforward in time. The model shows\nyou jet streams and weather pat-terns, just like the real world!\nSW: As a climate physicist, are you\nconscious of your carbon foot-print? Do you fly?\nJH: I do fly but only if I can justify\nit and I try to combine trips. I drive\na little electric car into College. I\ncharge it every night at home. It\u2019s\nquite cheap to run but replacing the\nbattery is very expensive.\nSW: What would you do if you had influence in government?\nJH: I would raise carbon taxes and invest\nin alternative energy sources.\nSW: Do you have any advice for scientists at the beginning of their careers?\nJH: It is tough. You need to maintain an\ninterest, work hard and not be afraid to\nask for advice. Don\u2019t cry in a corner if\nthings don\u2019t work.\nNot the bees! Not the bees! Neonicotinoid ban comes with a sting\nThe European Union has voted in favour of a ban on neonicotinoids, the\nmost widely used pesticide in the\nworld. However, with \ufb01erce behind-the-scenes campaigns and passionate\nlobbying from all parties involved, this\nresult was by no means easily decid-ed. So why have neonicotinoids been\nbanned? How much will this help\nhoney bee populations? And why does\nit matter to us?\nNeonicotinoids were developed to\ne\ufb00ectively kill unwanted insects on\ncrops while being harmless to humans and other mammals. However,\nwhilst their use across the world has\nincreased over recent decades, honey\nbee numbers have plummeted. This\ndoes not seem to be a coincidental\ncorrelation; several high pro\ufb01le scienti\ufb01c studies have linked neonicoti-noids to the decline of honey bees. A\npaper published in Science last year\nfound that exposure to the insecticide\ncaused an 85% reduction in the production of queen bees, which are crucial to establish new colonies.\nThis is vitally important as bees do\nso much more than make honey \u2013\nthey are estimated to pollinate a third\nof the food we eat. A much quoted\nremark states that: \"If the bee disappeared o\ufb00 the surface of the globe,\nman would only have four years of\nlife left. No more bees, no more pol-lination, no more plants, no more\nanimals, no more man.\" Though there\nis a lack of consensus over who actually said this, let alone how accurate a\nprediction it is, its foreboding vision\nindicates just how instrumental bees\nare to life as we know it.\nIn Hanyuan County, China, where\nbees have already been wiped out by\nthe use of pesticides, farmers have resorted to employing people to hand\npollinate pear trees with feather dusters and paint brushes. Friends of the\nEarth have estimated that to do this\nfor crops in the UK would cost \u00a31.8bn\na year, a sum which would no doubt be\nre\ufb02ected in the price of food.\nWith a 53% fall in managed British bee colonies since 1985 mirroring similar drops worldwide, declining pollinator populations have been\nidenti\ufb01ed as a serious risk to global\nfood production \u2013 the last thing we\nneed with an ever-growing human\npopulation to feed.\nTherefore falling bee\nnumbers represent\nnot only a conservation issue, but also\na serious economic\nand social issue.\nBut how far will the\nban on neonicoti-noids go to reversing\nthis alarming trend?\nThe short answer\nis, we do not know.\nThere is no general\nagreement on the\ncause of the worldwide collapse in\nhoney bee colonies.\nInstead, the phenomenon (termed\ncolony collapse disorder in the USA),\nhas also been attributed to a range of\nother factors which include habitat\nloss, increasing numbers of parasites\nand levels of air pollution.\nWith this uncertainty in mind, it\nmay seem strange that a ban on the\nmost widely used insecticide has\nbeen put in place \u2013 especially when\nfaced with arguments from chemical\ncompanies and UK ministers that this\ncould negatively impact food production through an increase in pest levels.\nHowever, the precautionary principle\nis supposed to underlie environmental\nregulation.\nThis means that even without scienti\ufb01c consensus, there is a responsibility to protect the public or environment from harm if a plausible risk is\nfound. Perhaps the very fact that this\nissue has ignited such passionate lobbying from both sides illustrates how\nthe humble honey bee is not only important environmentally, but is also\ninstrumental economically and socially \u2013 we must do everything possible to\nprotect pollinators while we still can.\nNOT THE \u00a31.8bn, NOT THE \u00a31.8bn\nLaura Kor Science Writer\n\n"

This doodle is by Lauren Radcliffe, procrastinating\nlikehell?\nFRIDAY 17 MAY\n18\nArt which tackles melange with science has been explored previously in\nthese pages. However these clashes\nstill remain few and far between. Science as inspiration for intriguing piec-es, using art as a medium to explore\nthe signi\ufb01cance of science or portray\nits beauty has great potential and is\nnot yet as appreciated as it could be.\nOne artist bringing these themes to\nthe forefront is Susan Aldworth. She\nis known for her art-neuroscience\nmash-ups and has even worked with\nImperial neuroscientists involved in\nthe Parkinson\u2019s Brain Tissue Bank.\nCurrently on display at the National\nPortrait Gallery is The Portrait Anatomised, three prints which invite viewers to think about the concept of the\nself and the brain.\nThe portraits are of no ordinary\nsubjects. They are su\ufb00erers of epi-lepsy, a condition where excessive\nelectrical activity in the brain has serious impacts on daily life. It is not\nsomething to be stigmatised, frowned\ndown upon, or shunned. The exhibition doesn\u2019t shy away from this aspect;\ninstead, it displays epilepsy for what\nit is. It de\ufb01nes the subjects and their\npersonality. We are invited to consider\nthis and to question in what way our\nbrain de\ufb01nes us.\nElisabeth is a young mother. She is\nalso a portrait inspired by 17th century Evelyn tables on which dissected\nwhole-body blood vessels are glued.\nUsing images from body scans, Elisabeth\u2019s stark white skeleton is laid bare\non a black background.\nHer portrait isn\u2019t anatomised, but\nrather her anatomy is portrait-ised.\nWide eyes gaze into the world, this\nworld re\ufb02ects back to the viewer and\nwe stare back.\nElisabeth\u2019s face forms her womb,\nrepresenting the struggle she faced\nwhen considering how to become\npregnant whilst dealing with her epilepsy and deciding whether or not to\ncome o\ufb00 the medication, which could\nharm her unborn child.\nIf her head is a metaphor for her\npreoccupations, are our brains a\nmetaphor for our minds? In neurosci-ence, they are one and the same, but\non a human level this isn\u2019t the simplest\nthing to accept.\nAdjacent to Elisabeth sits Max. The\n\ufb01rst thing that strikes the viewer is a\nphoto of his face, eyes closed it seems\nto speak of relief, pain, contemplation,\nall or neither of those things. We are\nprompted to decide, white on black\nand particularly striking.\nAldworth wanted us to feel as\nthough we are diving into space \u2013 the\nmatter that makes up the subjects and\nourselves.\nThis is particularly thought-provok-ing when viewers follow the swirling\nwhite patterns, perhaps dendrites\nwhich allow brain cells to communicate along great distances. They create a kind of confusion which is exacerbated by the irregular anatomy of\nhis body parts. It reminds us of how\nthe mind and body a\ufb00ect each other,\nand how a disease of the former is the\nsame as a disease of the latter.\nThe swirls then link the canvas to\nthe exterior world; I\u2019d really like to\nbelieve they are the dendrites which\nallow our brain cells to connect with\nwhat is external to us.\n\u201cI always like my work to look like\nit has just landed on the page and\nis about to move o\ufb00, so electricity\n[used by brain cells to communicate]\nprovided me with a wonderful subject matter because it is transitory.\nIt moves with the moment,\u201d explains\nAldworth.\nThe third portrait is of Fiona. Just\nlike the other two, her huge eyes bear\ndown, but unlike the others, her heart\nsits in between them. Ancient idioms\nabout listening to hearts vs. heads\ncome to mind.\nWhere her hands should be, Fiona\u2019s\nears form a creepy eye-to-ear piercing\ngaze, locked with the viewer\u2019s. It is as\nthough we are trying to see what she\nhears by looking at her portrait, and\nin this way it seems as though her epilepsy a\ufb00ects how she perceives herself\nalongside how we perceive her.\nAll portraits also feature each subject\u2019s electroencephalogram (EEG)\nreadings. These are basically readings of brainwaves, and are the way\nin which epilepsy is detected and di-agnosed. When a seizure occurs the\nelectrical activity of a huge number\nof brain cells synchronise when they\nshould not and activity becomes large\nenough to be detected by the EEG.\nThough brainwaves carry informa-tion, thoughts cannot be decoded\nfrom them. In this way, the beautiful\npatterns, displayed in the heart of the\npicture, hold so much personal information yet tell us nothing about who\nthe subjects really are.\n\u201cThe portraits seem to reference the\nself, but they don\u2019t really, and I think\nin my work I\u2019m playing with that and\ntrying to give you a look inside the\nsubjects but in the end it is still just an\nanatomical experience. And their secrets are still really contained within\nthemselves.\u201d\nLa neuro vague\nLily Le Writer\nRead online at felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Changez recounts his early\nadulthood to the journalist: most\nof the \ufb01lm consists of \ufb02ashbacks.\nChangez is a child of capitalism \u2013\nhe is educated in an Ivy League university and quickly lands a prestigious\njob on Wall Street. He\u2019s living the\nhigh life \u2013 until the events of 9/11. Almost overnight, Changez, a Muslim,\nis met with suspicion and hate. He is\nstrip-searched at the airport whilst\nhis colleagues are let through customs with ease; erroneously arrested\nand stared at in the street. He soon\nquits his job to become an academic.\nThe \ufb01lm plots Changez\u2019s switch\nof allegiance from capitalism to militancy really well \u2013 we see his character morph imperceptibly during the\n\ufb02ashback scenes into the character\nwe see in the present day. The suggestion that both capitalism and militancy are a type of fundamentalism\nis a little heavy handed \u2013 I don\u2019t think\nthe \ufb01lm had quite enough scope in\norder to deal with such complicated\nissues coherently. I think the moral\naspect to the \ufb01lm (we shouldn\u2019t judge\na book by its cover) was also a little la-boured and simplistic \u2013 and possibly\na bit patronising to a modern audi-ence. That said the \ufb01lm is extremely\ncompelling, and has some fantastic\nperformances. The cafe scenes with\nthe journalist and Changez in the\npresent are intelligent and ramp up\nthe tension, despite the lack of action.\nThe love story that develops between Changez and Erica (Hud-son) is adorable, and helps to break\nup the wordy action-less scenes we\nsee in the present day Pakistan se-quences. Ahmed is hugely convincing throughout the \ufb01lm, and his\ndelivery is sensitive and subtle, and\nprovokes a lot of questions about the\nnature of the immigrant identity.\nHudson is endearing but less convincing \u2013 her character seems more\nof a plot device than anything else.\nAt the end, we are left uncertain of\nChangez\u2019s involvement in \u2018fundamentalism\u2019 and how reluctant he really is.\nThis is probably a good thing \u2013 anything more concrete would have been\ntrite and unrealistic. Plus it isn\u2019t important \u2013 the concluding scenes of the\n\ufb01lm are stunning, and will stay with\nyou long after you \ufb01nish watching.\n\n"

Was Dentistry ever intended\nas a project to be performed live?\nPatrick: We\u2019ve never done a live set.\nWith so much being improvised it\u2019s\nI\ntough to do. I know we\u2019re both very\nparticular too and wouldn\u2019t want to\ndo something live unless we were\n100% happy with it. Personally I \ufb01nd\nlaptop sets boring and wouldn\u2019t want\nto just stand around on stage. We use\nlive instruments too so if we were to\nplay live I\u2019d like to do something with\nthem but that takes a lot of work to\nget right. I\u2019ve always been interested\nin installations and would like to go\ndown that road. But as I said, we\u2019d\nboth have to be behind it. Saying that\nwe are meant to be touring with our\nlabel next summer.\nCian: I have never enjoyed live performance in the past. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve done a huge amount of,\nbut enough to know that it makes me\nfeel pretty uncomfortable. I\u2019ve always\nmuch preferred listening to music at\nhome than live, particularly quiet or\nslow music, that\u2019s certainly the way I\nhad hoped Vardogr would be expe-rienced. That\u2019s not to say I wouldn\u2019t\nlike to perform live in the future, I\nwould, very much, it would just be a\nquestion of trying to \ufb01gure out how\nbest to present material like this in a\nway that would be interesting.\nRA: How do you make the sounds\nand does each person have a distinct role?\nPatrick: Well we both have di\ufb00erent\napproaches to making music. For the\nmost part I use Ableton live but do\nuse actual synths from time to time.\nThe studio we recorded the album\nin, third eye, in Dublin, has amazing\nbanks of synths so we used them on\nVardogr. At home when I\u2019m making music it usually depends on my\nmood. Usually though I have an idea\nand will roll with it. Recently I was\nusing a lot of \ufb01eld recordings and\nnature sounds; But nothing is ever\nexclusive and no one has a \ufb01xed role.\nCian: I use Ableton Live for arrang-ing, as well as guitar, e\ufb00ects pedals,\n\ufb01eld recordings, a cheapo Casio keyboard that I\u2019ve had for a really long\ntime, and is totally shit but I love it, a\ncouple of tasty synths that have made\nsure I haven\u2019t been able to a\ufb00ord a\nholiday for a couple of years, an ac-cordion, an old Hohner organ, anything I can get my hands on...\nRA: I read online that Ambarchi\nwas an in\ufb02uence, who else in\ufb02uenced your sound?\nCian: If I had to narrow it down, and\nI really hate to do so, I\u2019d say Alog\nand Phonophani are big in\ufb02uences,\nthey seem to apply an attitude that I\nreally agree with\u2026 whatever\u2019s available to them can be used in a song\nif it sounds good, and that\u2019s an attitude that I wholeheartedly support.\nIn fact, as a label, Rune Grammofon\nhas been hugely in\ufb02uential \u2026 stu\ufb00\nlike Deathprod, Spunk, Archetti/\nWiget, Supersilent, have never been\ntoo far from my CD player over the\npast few years .\nPatrick: We both worked in record\nstores for over 20 years combined,\nwhen you do that its hard not to be\nexposed to something good in literally every genre (although blues proves\nelusive for us both), there are pop\nsongs I like right down to noise\u2026\nIn terms of \u2018our\u2019 \u2018genre\u2019 of music,\nI suppose Stars of the Lid was the\n\ufb01rst group I heard that was like a\npenny dropping. I\u2019ve always loved\ndrone since I was a kid (the sound\nof a fan humming in a room, the din\nof a busy street, an orchestra tuning\nup) but I never knew there was music\nthat utilised it until I heard Stars of\nthe Lid. It was actually then through\nthe guidance of Vinny Dermody (The\nJimmy Cake), who I worked with at\nthe time that got me into the likes of\nMorton Feldman and some other,\nmore obscure contemporary classical composers like La Monte Young.\nSonic Youth were de\ufb01nitely in\ufb02uential too in the way they used noise as\nan instrument and not just an extension of a sound\u2026\nRA: Is there much of an experimental scene in Ireland as a whole?\nPatrick: I think that, against the\nodds, there is little to no scene in\nIreland. We have such a rich history of art in Ireland, from the Yeats\nbrothers to Beckett to le Brocquy,\nit\u2019s hard to see why Ireland doesn\u2019t\nhave more culturally diverse music scenes, and never really has for\nthat matter. I think it comes down\nto how ingrained traditional Irish\nmusic is culturally. Unlike a lot of\nother countries, traditional music is\nsoaked into the cultural framework\nof the island ... and as such I think it\nshapes the way a lot of Irish people\nview music as they get older. I honestly think Dublin produces more\ngood bands per capita, however the\nlast 4-5 years has seen an in\ufb02ux of\nnonsensical, \u2018image over substance\u2019,\nrich music. I honestly think half the\n\u2018artists\u2019 that picked up a synth in the\nlast few years would probably be in a\nCranberries type band had they been\nborn a decade earlier. Saying that,\nthere are some phenomenal bands\nthat we produce in this country, but\nsadly they\u2019ll rarely get the credit.\nAMS album of the week\nThe National are a band who have\ntranscended modern music trends.\nThey first came to prominence with\nthe glut of \u201cpost-punk revival\u201d indie\nbands in the mid-2000s. That scene\ndied years ago, but The National\nrose from the ashes, and have continued to rise and rise. Their last al-bum, High Violet, saw them getting\ntop billing at some of the biggest festivals in the world and it\u2019s a position\nthey richly desevred. Whilst their\npeers desperately tried to cling to past glories by claiming their new album\nwas \u201cjust like the first one\u201d (Interpol) or radically changed their style all the\ntime hoping something would stick (Bloc Party) or just gave up completely\n(Franz Ferdinand), The National have calmly gone about writing great music that comes naturally. The new record, Trouble Will Find Me, is a perfect\nextension of that. It\u2019s truly gorgeous, and should cement the National\u2019s place\nat the top of modern indie rock.\nThis is the sound of a band working in perfect harmony. Every member is\nhaving an absolute stormer. Each song seems like a unified vision with every\ninstrument having its part to play. It meshes together beautifully. For exam-ple, the adorable guitar part repeated through \u2018I Need My Girl\u2019 is enough\nto cement the track as fantastic even without the beautiful lyrics and Matt\u2019s\nperfect baritone, and after that you\u2019ve still got a rhythm section doing everything right. It\u2019s rare for me to use the repeat one function on my iTunes, but\nthis song had that for a good hour or two the other night. I suppose it\u2019s also\nrare for me to listen to one album over and over again, but you know, it\u2019s rare\nfor anything to be this good. This is the most fully formed a National album\nhas ever been, and that\u2019s coming from a huge National fan (as you may have\nworked out\u2026). I can see why some people might not like this, it\u2019s not the most\ndiverse record and if you don\u2019t dig the sound you might be asking them to\nswitch it up. The thing is, most of my favourite albums aren\u2019t very diverse, the\nvery best records don\u2019t need to be. When you\u2019ve absolutely nailed a sound, as\nthe National have here, 55 minutes of it doesn\u2019t feel samey, it feels immersive,\nand this album is one I could (and will) keep myself fully immersed in for a\ngood while yet.\nThe National \u2013TroubleWillFindMe\nStuart Masson\nRead this and\nmore from\nthe comfort\nof your bed.\nHow?

The letter calls the petting\nzoo \u201cill-conceived\u201d and asks for Imperial to \u201cmake a formal to avoiding future\nevents that promote the mistreatment of\nanimals\u201d.\nIn the letter, addressed to Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions (President & Rector), safety\nto students and treatment of animals are\ncited as reasons to stop the petting zoo,\nwhich is part of the Union\u2019s Stress Less\ncampaign.\nThe letter states \u201cExperts indicate\nthat petting zoos are hotbeds of serious\npathogens, including E coli and salmonella bacteria. The area surrounding\nan animal\u2019s cage can be teeming with\nbacteria. According to the Health and\nSafety Executive, infections can spread\nthrough direct or even indirect animal\ncontact, and in some cases the illness\ncan be fatal.\u201d The letter goes on to say\nthat anxious students during exam season would have \u201cweakened immune systems\u201d and therefore be at a greater risk\nof infection, which PETA say means that\nstudents \u201ccan develop bloody diarrhoea,\nanaemia, chronic kidney failure or neurological impairments such as seizures\nand strokes\u201d.\nThe letter also sighted cruelty to animals as a reason to stop the petting zoo,\nsaying that they \u201ccontribute to a cruel\ncycle of breeding, abandonment and\nkilling\u201d. It said \u201c Exhibitors take young\nanimals on the road and, if they survive\nthe stress of transport and handling, typically dispose of them when they become\nmore difficult to handle, replacing them\nwith new animals.\u201d PETA also raised\nconcerns over the way that the animals\nwould be kept in general, saying that\nthey are kept in unnatural social and\nfamily groups and that the habitats they\nare kept in \u201cinhibit or prevent natural behaviour\u201d.\nPETA say that \u201cImperial College London would be setting a bad example for\nothers\u201d if the planned petting zoo were\nto go ahead; it suggests masseurs as a re-placement, which the Union had in the\nLibrary Caf\u00e9 on Tuesday 14 May (also\nas part of the Stress Less campaign).\nPETAalso referenced a recent incident\nat Oxford when the Principle of Somerville College told students to cancel the\nplans to have a live shark displayed in a\ntank during their summer ball following\nmultiple complaints from students and\nformer students.\nThere is even reference to the cancelled plans Somerville College, Oxford\nImperial College Union are not the\nonly student union around the UK to\nhost a petting zoo. Leeds and Southampton are two student unions that have also\nbrought a petting zoo to students during\nexam time to relieve stress.\nFelix contacted the Union who replied\nwith the following statement: \u201cThe College have been involved from the outset\nin the planning of the Union\u2019s campaign,\nand permission had been sought from\nthe relevant persons. Animal welfare has\nalso been at the forefront of our planning\nfrom the start. We chose our provider,\nPets4Ponies, upon the recommendation\nof the LSE Students\u2019 Union, who were\nsatisfied with the safety and welfare of\nthe animals when they first held a petting zoo this time last year.

    "content": "ICUWRFC saw the end of an incredible season before Easter, being promoted to the BUCS South Eastern\n1A division and winning the LUSL\nleague with an impressive win against\nUCL placed 2 BUCS leagues above IC.\nNot only this, but Imperial were also\ncrowned BUCS South-Eastern conference cup champions for the second\nyear in a row after another tense bout\nagainst old rivals King\u2019s College Medics. Given all of these successes, the\nteam would have been forgiven for\ntaking time out this term to rest and\nrecuperate. However, it wasn\u2019t long\nbefore the girls were back on the rugby\npitch, this time trying out their skills\nin 7s and 10s tournaments.\nOn May 1st the team headed out\nto Esher, Surrey, for the RFU May\nDay Women\u2019s 10s tournament. This\nis a newly organised summer social\nevent and Imperial turned up happy\nto enjoy the sun and see how far they\ncould go. After a slightly rusty start\nin the opening half of their \ufb01rst pool\nmatch against Chichester, Imperial\nsoon eased into the game again, remembering the solid plays and team\nwork that had won them their titles\nthis season. It wasn\u2019t long before the\nteam were back on \ufb01ne form despite\nthe lack of time to practice much 10s.\nWith con\ufb01dence restored after beating Chichester, the team then faced\nSt George\u2019s who dominated in the\nscrum, forcing Imperial to rethink\ntheir positioning in the pack. Scramble defence, notably from next year\u2019s\ncaptain Pip Heggie, helped us hold St\nGeorge\u2019s o\ufb00 from the try line despite\nseveral close calls. In the \ufb01nal pool\nmatch, Imperial faced Southampton,\nwinning con\ufb01dently thanks to breakaway runs from current captain Yasmin\nEdwards and Amy Humphreys. With\nthree wins from three and coming top\nof their pool, Imperial quali\ufb01ed for\nthe \ufb01nal played on the main stadium\npitch. IC conceded an early try to Surrey but equalised with a last minute\ntry from winger Sammy Ardi bringing\nthe score to 7-7 at full time. It then became a tense golden try situation and\nIC worked as a team to dominate the\ngame. The reward was a try beneath\nthe posts by Lucy Olli\ufb00 after crashing\nthrough the Surrey defence with style.\nIC won the competition and were\nawarded the cup by England Women\u2019s\nscrum half La Toya Mason.\nJust 3 days later, IC once again headed out to play some more Rugby, this\ntime to Richmond where they entered\nthe Middlesex Ladies 7s Bowl. They\nreached the \ufb01nal of the tournament\nwhich was played in front of a crowd\nin the main stadium and faced Richmond Saxons, a team of considerably\nolder and more experienced play-ers. IC had already played this team\ntwice in the tournament, losing the\n\ufb01rst game and winning the second so\neverything was to play for. IC started\nstrong, keeping possession of the ball\nCan anything stop ICUWRFC?\nSPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 17 MAY\n30\nSports Writer\nCharlotte Hewitt\nThe British University Tenpin Bowling Association (BUTBA) Cup \ufb01nal\nagainst Loughborough, She\ufb03eld, and\nPortsmouth took place in Rugby last\nbank holiday Sunday.\nIn the semi-\ufb01nal, we were matched\nagainst our Northern dominant rival,\nShe\ufb03eld. Facing six strong She\ufb03eld\nbowlers who all had 180-pin averages,\nImperial bowlers showed remarkable\nresilience. After an enthralling battle,\nImperial team B (Kelvin Wong (c), Michael Lau, and Raymond Yang) were\nonly 6 pins behind the opponents,\nwith scores 505-498, 493-498, and\n513-521. Although we lost 1-15 over-all, there is no shame in defeat.\nOn the \ufb02ip side, our best Imperial\nbowler, Hui Erh Tay, has never let us\ndown. Hitting a 617 high series (183-216-218) in the semi-\ufb01nal, she broke\nher own record in the BUCS Championship taken place last February. Unsurprisingly, this has secured her the\ntitles of \u2018Female High Game\u2019 and \u2018Female High Series\u2019 in the BUTBA Cup.\nMoving on to the Second Runnersup match, the Imperial team and their\nsouthern rival, Portsmouth, were both\nSports Writer\nJosephine Chiu\nand smashing through the Saxons\u2019\ndefence, and were rewarded with a\ntry scored by Yasmin Edwards. Entering the second half, IC\u2019s defense was\nstrong with notably impressive tackles\nmade by Lucy Olli\ufb00 causing the crowd\nto roar. The forwards worked well to\nturn over the ball and regain posses-sion, passing it out to the back line and\nscoring two more tries by Carolanne\nVouriot and Sammy Ardi. The \ufb01nal\nscore was 17-0 and IC were chu\ufb00ed at\ntheir success against such sti\ufb00 compe-tition.\nWith these results, ICUWRFC have\nwon all 5 competitions entered this\nyear and are relishing the new challenges posed by promotion in the\nBUCS league for next year. In the\nmeantime, the team will be heading\nto the Newquay Surf 7s tournament at\nthe end of June to enjoy the sun, sea\nand to try and keep the winning streak\nalive!\nequally strong at the beginning, drawing a tie 2-2 after the \ufb01rst game. However, while Portsmouth maintained\ntheir performance, our team slowly\nlost shape, slipping points away in the\ngame and losing 3-13 in the end.\nEven though Imperial was placed\nfourth, the team wasn\u2019t too upset. It\nwas far from a gloomy scene as it was\nstill our most outstanding achievement of all. \u201cI would say this is a great\nstart. Well done to every team member who tried their best,\u201d Captain Kelvin Wong continued, \u2018and put so much\ne\ufb00ort in training. You guys have been\namazing throughout the year.\u2019\nTenpin get bowled over\nICUWRFC finish off their incredible season in style\n\n"

    "content": "DRUGS SURVEY\nOF THE 762 RESPONSES...\n54% SAID THEY HAD TRIED DRUGS\n57%\nMALE\n49%\nFEMALE\nSAID YES TO\nHAVING TRIED\nDRUGS\nDruggy Departments\nIt may be that Imperial is not as bad an in\ufb02uence on incoming\nstudents as people may think. With 76% of students who have\ntried drugs having done so before university, it may be that a\ncertain element of the drug culture is derived from students\u2019\npast experiences outside of College.\nThat said, are these people having an in\ufb02uence on students\nwho may not have tried anything before? It was found that\n95% of students who now sell drugs did indulge in the highs\nbefore UCAS was sent o\ufb00, showing that longevity is the key\nto dealing success.\nSome na\u00efve Freshers may be remaining na\u00efve throughout\ntheir years, but some students are, as expected, experimenting as the years go on. Based on year of intake, more and\nmore people have taken drugs the longer they have been at\nuniversity. A di\ufb00erence of only around 14% however between\nthis year\u2019s spread of students does hint that there still isn\u2019t\nmuch of a drug in\ufb02uence within the student body.\nWhat drugs are people taking?\nPerhaps fairly unsurprisingly the drug that most people had\ntried was cannabis, by a pretty signi\ufb01cant amount. The least\ntried was heroin (Imperial isn\u2019t THAT depressing it seems).\nIn terms of regular and occasional use, cannabis was once\nagain head and shoulders above the rest. MDMA/Ecstasy was\nsecond, with laughing gas in third. The rest were all in single\n\ufb01gures for occasional use. Interestingly, laughing gas was the\ndrug with the highest percent of \u201ctried once\u201d use. This could be\nbecause it is widely available on holiday in Malia, Kavos, and\nall other destinations likely to feature on Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents. The only drug that threw up an even remotely\nstatistically signi\ufb01cant number for habitual (daily) use was\ncannabis.\nThere was a bit of a discrepancy between the drugs that men\nand women favoured, but it was fairly minor. A higher proportion of men said that they regularly smoke weed.\nFor an academically demanding university, there didn\u2019t seem\nto be widespread use of study drugs such as ritalin and aderall.\nHeroin\nMethoxetamine\nDMT\nBenzos\nPrescription opiates\nLSD\nSpeed\nMephedrone\nCocaine\nKetamine\nMushrooms\nBefore or during university?\n2009 \u2013 61%\n2011 - 51&\n2012 \u2013 47%\n2010 \u2013 58%\nSo is there a drug community at Imperial? This seems to be\ndependant on who you ask. When asking those who have ever\ntaken drugs, 44% consider there to be some sort of drug scene,\nwhereas those who have not fallen susceptible to chemical highs\nat any point either generally don\u2019t know if there is a scene (41%)\nor don\u2019t think there is (26%). When it comes to drugs therefore,\nit seems to be the case it is who you know, not necessarily what\nyou know.\nSurvey Design: Tim Arbabzadah,\nRoss Gray\nSurvey Coding: Philip Kent, Jonathan\nKim\nAnalysis: Tim Arbabzadah, Ross Gray,\nPhilippa Skett\nWords: Tim Arbabzadah, Philippa\nSkett\nIllustrations: Lizzy Griffiths\nIt seems that, re\ufb02ective of the free-thinking student body that we are, many put\ndown drug trialling whilst at Imperial down to curiosity and fun, which\nmay correlate to the locations of drug trial being most often in bars or\nclubs. The Union apparently appears more bearable than previously\nconsidered, with only 6 students admitting to having to resort to more\nthan alcohol to have a good time.\nHowever, it does depend on when you started experimenting \u2013 many\nwho started taking drugs before university, have said they have also pressured someone in their past: 11% have admitted to persuading their friends into\ntaking a toke at some point too.\nStudents who have taken up the habit since starting seem to be more relaxed,\nwith only 7% having an in\ufb02uence on others. All in all though, peer pressure seems\nvery lax at Imperial, possibly indicative as to why seemingly few people pick up the\nhabit after coming to South Kensington.\nSo, the question on the lips on the academically inclined Imperial students may be:\ndoes drug taking e\ufb00ect your degree? For\nthose who take drugs, all in all, 86% people\nstated that their drug use has not in\ufb02uenced\ntheir degree at all. This does di\ufb00er between\nDepartments however: 17% of those in Bioengineering seem to think that drugs have\nsomewhat disrupted their studies, whereas in\nother departments this percentage seems to\nbe signi\ufb01cantly less.\nSo what sort of dependency are students experiencing with drugs? With cannabis\nbeing the popular drug of choice on campus, it seems that this correlates with\nthe low level of dependency being experienced across the student body. Only 9\npeople have said they have experienced dependency of any sort, with 6 being only\npsychologically dependant and 3 being physically dependant too. However, with\n4% of those who have taken drugs suspected addiction, this may be something that\nneeds to be addressed by welfare services in the future.\nDespite the vagueness within this open question, 60% of those that take\ndrugs consider alcohol to be just as, if not more so harmful. This increases\nto 64% of those sampled who were using drugs before starting university\nWhen asked about legalisation in general, 42% said drugs should be legalised.\nFor future surveys, asking people what speci\ufb01c drugs should be made legal\nwould be better. A lot of people had long, eloquent responses to this one.\nMany said some (soft) drugs, not all, should be legal. Mostly, people said cannabis should be legalised.\nOf the people that said that they wanted drugs to be legalised, just under\n75% of them had taken drugs before, which is no surprise. What was a bit\nweird was that of the people that took drugs 57% said it should be legalised,\nmeaning 43% want it to be illegal, but still want to do it \u2013 presumably so they\ncan feel like massive badasses whenever they do a line. \u201cI\u2019m dangerous baby,\nI do things that are illegal, and rightly so\u201d.\nMen favoured legalisation a lot more (oi oi banter with the lads etc?) than\nwomen: 48% of men say that it should be legalised, while only 31% of women\nthought it should be legalised. 31% of women said no to legalisation. So, in\ngeneral, men are keener on legalisation and women are keener on not legalis-ing. When comparing departments, Physics were most for it (53% say yes,\npresumably to make staring out to space more interesting and trippy), and\nEarth Science & Engineering seemed not keen on the idea with 25% wanting\nlegalisation. Who needs drugs when you\u2019re staring at rocks all day! Unsurprisingly, people who said that they either took drugs regularly, or used to\ntake drugs regularly, very heavily favoured legalisation.\nA university wide drugs study ran by Student Beans in 2012, answered by\n1,903 people, found that actually 54% of students would have taken drugs\nin there time at university.\nHowever, nationally, 79% of students who have taken drugs did so before university, showing that we seem to have attracted the less adventurous sixth formers.\nBut how do we compare to the world outside of university? Latest \ufb01gures\nfrom the Home O\ufb03ce show that two thirds of adults have taken drugs at\nleast once, meaning that for those not brave enough to get experimental\non campus, there is still hope for after graduation. However, with the national average of \ufb01rst time drug use being between the ages of 16 and 18,\nthis explains why so many students who take drugs at Imperial already did\nso before arriving in October.\nDrug taking community?

For more\ninformation on how this was done,\nemail felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThank you to everyone that took the\nsurvey!\nThe trouble with surveys\nThis is the most boring part of the\nwhole survey, so I won\u2019t write too\nmuch.\nWhen undertaking a survey such as\nthis there are many problems. They\ndon\u2019t just involve people trolling it for\ntheir own amusement. There is, we\nbelieve, a self selection process. If you\nhave taken drugs you are more likely\nto take the survey. Although this is,\nof course, something that we cannot\nprove. There is also the reverse in op-eration. People may be wary of taking\nsuch a survey and admitting to illegal\nactivities. This is made more di\ufb03cult\nby the fact that you had to put your\nCollege username and password in to\naccess the survey. A lot of people who\nhadn\u2019t taken drugs also did the survey,\nand the views we got were fascinating. I\nreally hope that you enjoy having a look\nat this as much as we enjoyed making\nit. It\u2019s safe to say we may have messed\nup the wording of some questions, and\nhave much to learn, but there\u2019s a \ufb01rst\ntime for everything. \u2013 Tim Arbabzadah\nPeer pressure\nChemical\nEngineering\n\u2013\n43\nBusiness\nSchool\n\u2013\n100\nMaterials\n\u2013\n71\nMech\nEng\n\u2013\n63\nBioengineering\n\u2013\n63\nCivil\nEngineering\n\u2013\n62\nPhysics\n\u2013\n61\nLife\nSciences\n\u201355\nMathematics\n\u2013\n52\nAeronautics\n\u2013\n52\nHumanities\n\u2013\n50\nEEE\n\u2013\n48\nMedicine\n\u2013\n47\nChemistry\n\u2013\n47\nComputing\n\u2013\n47\nEarth\nScience\n&\nEngineering\n\u2013\n45\nNote that all numbers in the above graph are quoted as percentages of respondents from that department.

They\u2019re the only ones I\u2019ve seen\nwith scientific studies saying they are less\ndamaging than alcohol.\u201d\n\u201cI used to agree with legalisation until I worked with psych\npatientsandsawthelongtermeffectsofcannabisonsome\npeople- I think legalizing would mean people relax about\ntaking it and therefore more people are at risk of mental\nhealth problems so I am against it.\u201d\n\u201cI think there are little groups of people who are known for taking MDMA\non nights out, or smoking weed at\nparties, but they integrate very well\nwithin social groups who merely\ndrink on nights out.\u201d\n\u201cSome not all should be legalised.
